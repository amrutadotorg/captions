1
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:59,698
Today is a special day, as you know;
we are worshipping the Goddess

2
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:06,680
who came on this earth
nine times before,

3
00:03:07,163 --> 00:03:10,943
to kill all the demons
and all the negativity,

4
00:03:11,148 --> 00:03:19,308
and relieve all the
bhaktas to worship.

5
00:03:20,385 --> 00:03:26,325
All Her work has already
been described.

6
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:35,760
Despite that they find
new type of devils,

7
00:03:37,313 --> 00:03:43,633
new type of negative people
have come back.

8
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:51,100
Perhaps it had to be.

9
00:04:03,025 --> 00:04:08,315
This had to be, maybe,
after all it’s Kali Yuga.

10
00:04:08,975 --> 00:04:17,370
And the drama of Kali Yuga would not be
 performed unless and until they are there.

11
00:04:20,308 --> 00:04:24,418
So to complete
this drama they came.

12
00:04:25,997 --> 00:04:38,397
But this time, it’s going to be
a very different type of war.

13
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:45,710
It’s going to be the war
of the peaceful people.

14
00:04:47,262 --> 00:04:56,375
And the peaceful people are the most successful people

15
00:04:56,911 --> 00:05:03,061
in every walk of life, even in the war.

16
00:05:03,061 --> 00:05:06,611
It did not work out before.

17
00:05:07,203 --> 00:05:11,793
They say that when
Genghis Khan came,

18
00:05:12,467 --> 00:05:20,177
he went to a very big monastery
of Buddhists near Gaya

19
00:05:20,882 --> 00:05:23,392
and killed all of them.

20
00:05:23,732 --> 00:05:27,122
There were about thirty
thousand of Buddhists there

21
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:32,920
and they didn’t say a word,
and they were all killed.

22
00:05:34,132 --> 00:05:38,172
So people started
disbelieving in Buddhism.

23
00:05:38,735 --> 00:05:44,175
They said, “What kind of a Buddhism
is here? Why didn’t Buddha save them?”

24
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:49,220
That’s human style of thinking.

25
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:55,462
"Buddha should have saved these thirty
thousand people who were peaceful,

26
00:05:56,175 --> 00:06:04,085
who were resisting in a manner
that was no resistance,

27
00:06:05,201 --> 00:06:10,021
and so they were all killed by this
horrible fellow called Genghis Khan."

28
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:18,239
But you’ll be surprised, in this Kali Yuga,
 this Genghis Khan has been praised by many authors.

29
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:21,448
And there are books written about him.

30
00:06:21,865 --> 00:06:26,595
He was not a Muslim but
some sort of a crackpot.

31
00:06:27,325 --> 00:06:32,615
He finished off many mosques,

32
00:06:33,061 --> 00:06:40,141
he destroyed many
beautiful buildings

33
00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:46,078
and also, he came to India
and ruled there for a short time.

34
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,580
All that’s a history.

35
00:06:50,417 --> 00:07:09,768
In the same way, there have been wars
between Christians and non-Christians,

36
00:07:11,123 --> 00:07:15,253
between Muslims
and non-Muslims.

37
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:26,512
All kinds of wars we have heard of
where only the faithful got lost,

38
00:07:27,051 --> 00:07:29,411
the real people got lost.

39
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:38,386
The one who worshipped
God with full faith got lost.

40
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,900
So, many people become atheist

41
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:49,827
and they said, “There is nothing like God,
nothing like his divine Power.

42
00:07:50,193 --> 00:07:56,484
It never existed. We were stupid,
we were foolish to follow all this".

43
00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:02,812
And those who were in charge of religion
took full advantage of that

44
00:08:02,812 --> 00:08:08,451
and said that, "These people
were sinful people,

45
00:08:08,451 --> 00:08:12,931
these people were not godly people,

46
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:19,130
and that’s how they were killed by
us and we were victorious".

47
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:27,060
The idea of victory they had
that they have been successful

48
00:08:27,454 --> 00:08:31,884
"and so many people have
been butchered by us".

49
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:39,695
So we come to Kali Yuga,

50
00:08:40,745 --> 00:08:47,985
and in Kali Yuga, same thing
has started in a subtler way;

51
00:08:48,615 --> 00:08:51,935
in a different way
it has started that

52
00:08:51,935 --> 00:09:02,045
there’s a big war going on
between the people who are anti-God,

53
00:09:02,818 --> 00:09:08,288
and who are using God
for their own purpose.

54
00:09:08,898 --> 00:09:13,778
Very dishonest, very corrupt,
very cruel people.

55
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:19,713
And they are using
the flag of God,

56
00:09:20,165 --> 00:09:26,655
that banner which they
have no right to use.

57
00:09:27,048 --> 00:09:34,194
Then there are Sahaja Yogis
who have got their Realization,

58
00:09:34,194 --> 00:09:38,883
and they have to fight them.

59
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:48,000
Now the difference in the previous
wars and this war is very different.

60
00:09:50,312 --> 00:09:59,031
In those wars, you see, all those
who were supposed to be victorious

61
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:09,827
 - this was, after all, the nine battles of the Divine Mother -

62
00:10:10,722 --> 00:10:16,436
– the negativity that came up
and which became successful

63
00:10:16,436 --> 00:10:24,083
started feeling very confident that,
"We have achieved what we wanted".

64
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:35,051
But in Kali Yuga,
in the light of Kali Yuga,

65
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:44,548
all those historical victories
are regarded as shameful things,

66
00:10:45,435 --> 00:10:51,565
as something very
aggressive and nonsensical.

67
00:10:53,685 --> 00:10:57,235
This is now being described everywhere.

68
00:10:57,983 --> 00:11:08,321
Like, the white-skinned people went to America
and killed all the rest of them there.

69
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:14,810
– now that is coming into light.

70
00:11:15,905 --> 00:11:23,605
All these people who thought
themselves to be victorious:

71
00:11:23,885 --> 00:11:28,058
their children, their grandchildren,
their progeny are ashamed of them!

72
00:11:28,058 --> 00:11:33,688
Ashamed to call that
they were their forefathers

73
00:11:33,995 --> 00:11:37,245
– up till the last war.

74
00:11:39,042 --> 00:11:49,653
This awareness which has come is the real victory of modern times,

75
00:11:49,653 --> 00:11:52,801
of this Kali Yuga:

76
00:11:53,061 --> 00:11:59,131
that everything that was
accepted as a part of the game,

77
00:11:59,131 --> 00:12:05,481
as the lifestyle, you can call it,

78
00:12:05,905 --> 00:12:11,315
is now being challenged in
modern times, everywhere.

79
00:12:11,741 --> 00:12:19,221
Whatever is aggression,
whatever is oppression,

80
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:27,560
whatever is cruel is
now punished also.

81
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:35,617
You see, so many war
criminals must have escaped,

82
00:12:35,617 --> 00:12:39,407
but so many went into trials

83
00:12:39,407 --> 00:12:41,257
– never happened before.

84
00:12:41,533 --> 00:12:44,903
Nobody took Genghis Khan to a trial.

85
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:48,030
Now in a very subtle way

86
00:12:48,538 --> 00:12:52,948
all these aggressive people
are getting now afraid

87
00:12:53,061 --> 00:13:03,151
that they will be questioned,
and they may be tortured.

88
00:13:04,285 --> 00:13:06,581
It started I don’t know where,

89
00:13:06,581 --> 00:13:10,201
but definitely at the beginning
of the Kali Yuga.

90
00:13:10,435 --> 00:13:16,952
If you remember in this country was
 a great aggressive man called Mussolini,

91
00:13:17,248 --> 00:13:20,398
and ultimately he was hanged.

92
00:13:21,255 --> 00:13:23,955
In Germany there was
a very powerful man

93
00:13:24,493 --> 00:13:27,303
called Hitler, and Himmler
and all this.

94
00:13:27,743 --> 00:13:30,133
God knows what
happened to them

95
00:13:30,488 --> 00:13:33,658
– even the Germans don’t
want to take his name,

96
00:13:33,908 --> 00:13:36,688
they’re all ashamed of him.

97
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:40,820
Then we had somebody
say in England,

98
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,980
Warren Hastings who
came to India

99
00:13:44,253 --> 00:13:46,073
– he was put to jail.

100
00:13:46,393 --> 00:13:50,063
This was never done before.

101
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:56,920
If Napoleon aggressed people, he
thought he was very victorious;

102
00:13:57,353 --> 00:14:03,463
but he could not continue
with it, he had to face it.

103
00:14:04,685 --> 00:14:11,375
You see, anybody who has been aggressive,

104
00:14:11,793 --> 00:14:21,183
who has been dominating,
who has been very cruel, demonic,

105
00:14:22,188 --> 00:14:26,758
has been taken to task
mostly in his lifetime.

106
00:14:27,757 --> 00:14:34,707
Now, if not in his lifetime,

107
00:14:34,995 --> 00:14:39,135
afterwards he was maligned

108
00:14:39,135 --> 00:14:43,393
and he doesn’t have a name
like a hero or anything.

109
00:14:43,393 --> 00:14:47,698
People don’t want
to erect their statues.

110
00:14:48,632 --> 00:14:52,082
So the awareness has come
in the mind of the people.

111
00:14:52,515 --> 00:14:57,755
Like a person like Stalin who
ruled Russia once upon a time,

112
00:14:58,113 --> 00:15:02,303
today you can’t see even
one statue of Stalin.

113
00:15:02,613 --> 00:15:05,733
These are modern times.

114
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:10,360
See the power
of modern times!

115
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,170
And that is frightening
to those people

116
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:17,870
who think they can get along
with whatever they are doing.

117
00:15:18,515 --> 00:15:24,565
It is going to be very
soon understood by them

118
00:15:25,323 --> 00:15:32,513
that they have to stop all this
nonsense, otherwise they will suffer.

119
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:36,508
It’s not those whom
they are dominating

120
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:40,203
but those who are
dominating will suffer.

121
00:15:40,488 --> 00:15:44,241
They will suffer physically,
they will suffer mentally,

122
00:15:44,551 --> 00:15:46,141
they will suffer emotionally,

123
00:15:46,401 --> 00:15:52,481
and also their fame
will be in the mud.

124
00:15:52,810 --> 00:16:01,730
So today’s victory of the
power of the Divine Mother

125
00:16:02,348 --> 00:16:08,461
is doing one very great
work, is to expose;

126
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:16,156
and this exposure will be condemning publicly

127
00:16:16,156 --> 00:16:19,821
 those people who are doing wrong.

128
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:23,960
If you see from that point of view,

129
00:16:24,373 --> 00:16:30,363
you will understand how
we are victorious now.

130
00:16:31,258 --> 00:16:35,789
Many of you felt very sad
that I didn’t get the award [Peace Nobel Price].

131
00:16:35,789 --> 00:16:38,469
This award makes no
difference to Me,

132
00:16:38,808 --> 00:16:41,308
and to you also, I must tell you;

133
00:16:41,308 --> 00:16:45,578
because you have come without
I having any award,

134
00:16:45,863 --> 00:16:49,613
and many will come without
having any award as such.

135
00:16:50,318 --> 00:16:55,618
But this time, for the
first time, if you notice

136
00:16:55,863 --> 00:16:59,803
the people who got award
are condemned.

137
00:17:00,275 --> 00:17:06,175
Even now they are writing against it,
even now they are criticizing.

138
00:17:06,842 --> 00:17:11,742
So those who have been, they
thought they were very smart,

139
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,721
but the smartness is out now

140
00:17:14,721 --> 00:17:16,865
and I don’t know
how long will it go on;

141
00:17:16,865 --> 00:17:22,041
because even today if you use, open a newspaper
you find something about it,

142
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,401
that how stupidly
they have done it

143
00:17:25,401 --> 00:17:28,751
– they can’t understand what was
the reason they have done it.

144
00:17:29,253 --> 00:17:32,393
Not only the people who
selected are criticized,

145
00:17:32,393 --> 00:17:36,963
but very much more
the people who are selected.

146
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:45,311
Now, as being Sahaja Yogis,
we have to know what is the difference

147
00:17:45,311 --> 00:17:54,001
between the consciousness at that
time and awareness at this time.

148
00:17:56,297 --> 00:17:59,317
That time it was necessary
to kill those demons, finish them,

149
00:18:00,531 --> 00:18:04,481
but they are back
again on the stage.

150
00:18:08,851 --> 00:18:12,991
Now at this time when
it is Kali Yuga

151
00:18:13,891 --> 00:18:16,791
they are exposed,

152
00:18:18,891 --> 00:18:21,331
they are condemned,

153
00:18:21,631 --> 00:18:27,751
they are put in the jail, they
are now punished publicly.

154
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:32,421
So the collective awareness

155
00:18:33,421 --> 00:18:39,371
has got such a great victory
I think, over these people

156
00:18:39,641 --> 00:18:42,291
whom so many came,
killed and died

157
00:18:42,591 --> 00:18:44,851
without getting any
punishment out of it,

158
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:49,811
without getting any
defamation out of it.

159
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:53,571
Now let us see what
is consciousness

160
00:18:53,881 --> 00:18:57,921
and what is awareness.

161
00:19:09,251 --> 00:19:14,351
It is a subtle subject which
I think you all can understand.

162
00:19:16,571 --> 00:19:19,371
Consciousness is that

163
00:19:19,721 --> 00:19:23,521
when you are made conscious,
you become conscious about it.

164
00:19:23,891 --> 00:19:27,391
Like I have My
hand here all right,

165
00:19:27,391 --> 00:19:32,981
but normally I am not conscious
of it that I have a hand.

166
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:40,320
If a man is sleeping, he is
not conscious that he’s sleeping.

167
00:19:40,988 --> 00:19:45,508
When you tell Me “You have
a hand” I become conscious;

168
00:19:46,868 --> 00:19:50,968
or something pricks Me,
then I become conscious

169
00:19:51,911 --> 00:19:55,581
– otherwise I am
unconscious about it.

170
00:19:57,451 --> 00:20:04,701
I am absolutely unconscious about
My eyes, I am seeing everything;

171
00:20:05,261 --> 00:20:11,791
but supposing I become
blind, I can’t see:

172
00:20:12,131 --> 00:20:16,551
then I become conscious
of My eyes,

173
00:20:16,811 --> 00:20:21,641
that I have got My eyes through
which now I cannot see.

174
00:20:22,185 --> 00:20:29,395
So once you say there is this
hand, the consciousness is there.

175
00:20:29,903 --> 00:20:33,573
This we can say is the
knowledge about the hand,

176
00:20:33,573 --> 00:20:36,733
that you get knowledge
about that.

177
00:20:38,408 --> 00:20:40,208
But once

178
00:20:41,758 --> 00:20:46,618
you are not conscious of the hand,
that knowledge is disappeared.

179
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:53,620
So to say there is ignorance
or there is knowledge,

180
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:57,590
both things are just the same.

181
00:20:58,543 --> 00:21:06,473
You are not conscious of your hand
so you are quite ignorant about it.

182
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:09,728
Now supposing somebody says,

183
00:21:10,551 --> 00:21:13,871
“Your hands are very beautiful”.

184
00:21:14,821 --> 00:21:19,261
Somebody remarks like that then
I become conscious of my hand

185
00:21:19,561 --> 00:21:25,281
which is beautiful; otherwise
I never knew they were beautiful.

186
00:21:27,831 --> 00:21:32,841
So normally all human beings
live at that level,

187
00:21:33,401 --> 00:21:35,951
that somebody has to tell you.

188
00:21:36,241 --> 00:21:39,221
Now somebody said, "You
are wearing a very nice sari".

189
00:21:39,501 --> 00:21:45,811
All right. Then I look at it, "Yes,
it’s very nice, I never knew".

190
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:52,570
So somebody has to tell you,
then you become conscious;

191
00:21:53,963 --> 00:21:57,263
otherwise you are not.

192
00:21:59,468 --> 00:22:04,408
So we all human beings
at that level are like that.

193
00:22:05,543 --> 00:22:09,163
Now, what is awareness?

194
00:22:10,103 --> 00:22:12,203
– that’s a different thing.

195
00:22:13,545 --> 00:22:17,805
That means if I see

196
00:22:18,508 --> 00:22:23,118
somebody is attacking Me
I put My hand like this.

197
00:22:23,518 --> 00:22:26,868
That means I’m
aware I have a hand.

198
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:32,051
I’m not conscious but I’m aware that I have
a hand, I have to use it.

199
00:22:32,315 --> 00:22:34,725
Like here, in Italy, you
go on using your hands

200
00:22:34,725 --> 00:22:37,715
bringing them up all
the time like this.

201
00:22:39,103 --> 00:22:43,393
That means you know you
are aware that you have got hands,

202
00:22:43,798 --> 00:22:46,548
that you have to use
them for expressing

203
00:22:46,548 --> 00:22:50,378
something more sort
of emphatically.

204
00:22:53,071 --> 00:23:00,131
So we are sort of also
aware of our body,

205
00:23:00,491 --> 00:23:03,261
we are aware of others,

206
00:23:05,101 --> 00:23:07,491
we know about others,

207
00:23:08,021 --> 00:23:11,271
we know what sort of
a person another one is

208
00:23:11,671 --> 00:23:16,901
– up till you are Self-realized.

209
00:23:19,401 --> 00:23:22,291
After Self-realization what happens?

210
00:23:22,851 --> 00:23:24,971
It’s very interesting.

211
00:23:26,801 --> 00:23:33,011
After Self-realization you go
beyond both these things,

212
00:23:33,061 --> 00:23:37,151
consciousness and awareness,

213
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:43,618
because you go beyond thought.

214
00:23:45,513 --> 00:23:48,843
“You have gone beyond
thought” means what?

215
00:23:49,313 --> 00:23:57,535
Anger, all kinds of ideas, all kinds of aggression,

216
00:23:57,535 --> 00:24:02,275
everything is maneuvered

217
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:06,991
or worked through your mind.

218
00:24:07,535 --> 00:24:13,135
So if your mind is lost,
what will you do?

219
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:18,210
There’s no mind anymore.

220
00:24:19,195 --> 00:24:23,015
You exist with reality,

221
00:24:24,411 --> 00:24:28,621
so there is no mind to communicate.

222
00:24:29,391 --> 00:24:32,151
We call it 'thoughtlessly aware'.

223
00:24:32,481 --> 00:24:34,211
Means what?

224
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:36,941
We have conquered
all our enemies by

225
00:24:37,201 --> 00:24:41,221
giving up one enemy
that was our mind.

226
00:24:41,221 --> 00:24:44,311
There’s no mind to suggest,

227
00:24:44,663 --> 00:24:47,713
there’s no mind to tell you,

228
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:52,943
so once there is no
mind you are lost.

229
00:24:54,245 --> 00:24:56,405
Now it is being said that you ask

230
00:24:56,405 --> 00:24:59,615
a question to yourself,
“Who am I?”

231
00:25:01,695 --> 00:25:04,825
As soon as you ask this question
you become thoughtless,

232
00:25:05,551 --> 00:25:07,841
so you get lost.

233
00:25:08,771 --> 00:25:12,091
You cannot answer this question.

234
00:25:12,815 --> 00:25:17,245
Otherwise you might say, “I am
a woman, I am this, I am that”;

235
00:25:17,245 --> 00:25:24,825
“I am a bishop or I am a pope,
I am this, I am that.”

236
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:31,461
But once you are a Realized soul,
who will tell  you who you are?

237
00:25:31,461 --> 00:25:35,531
Because the one which tells
you is the mind which doesn’t exist

238
00:25:35,531 --> 00:25:37,351
- no thought

239
00:25:39,223 --> 00:25:44,723
– means you get dissolved
into your Self.

240
00:25:47,042 --> 00:25:49,602
This is what is reality.

241
00:25:52,373 --> 00:25:58,283
But you are aware also;
now that’s another point.

242
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:07,501
If you ask yourself a question
you are not there,

243
00:26:09,141 --> 00:26:10,951
but you are aware.

244
00:26:11,721 --> 00:26:14,031
If your Nabhi is catching
you immediately you know

245
00:26:14,271 --> 00:26:17,431
“My Nabhi is catching,
I have got liver.”

246
00:26:18,761 --> 00:26:20,211
Don’t have to ask questions.

247
00:26:20,491 --> 00:26:22,201
Or somebody is standing near you,

248
00:26:22,451 --> 00:26:26,711
his left Swadisthana
– “Oh my God, it is this one!”

249
00:26:30,731 --> 00:26:32,851
If somebody is very angry
and hot tempered,

250
00:26:33,161 --> 00:26:35,461
immediately you’ll feel such
heat from that person,

251
00:26:35,721 --> 00:26:39,251
you’ll say, “Oh baba,
I’ll run away from this man.”

252
00:26:39,251 --> 00:26:42,591
So this is a new

253
00:26:46,258 --> 00:26:49,588
realm you have entered into reality,

254
00:26:50,461 --> 00:26:54,381
which you are never aware of before.

255
00:26:55,170 --> 00:27:01,030
Now supposing there’s a very
bad man standing near you.

256
00:27:02,271 --> 00:27:06,711
He might be a thief, he might
be a murderer, anything

257
00:27:07,011 --> 00:27:10,071
– you will not be even
conscious of it

258
00:27:10,371 --> 00:27:13,701
leave alone aware, normally.

259
00:27:14,021 --> 00:27:18,141
But once you are a realized soul,

260
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:25,671
you become aware of the whole.

261
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:28,191
That is reality.

262
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:33,921
What are the problems,
in the collective?

263
00:27:34,873 --> 00:27:38,323
You become aware of the collective.

264
00:27:38,893 --> 00:27:41,823
You become aware of the
problems of the whole world.

265
00:27:42,058 --> 00:27:45,508
Now, this awareness is
very different.

266
00:27:46,507 --> 00:27:50,767
The first awareness as
I told you is like this,

267
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:56,120
that if somebody tells you
you are this and this,

268
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:59,768
you become aware of it.

269
00:28:01,798 --> 00:28:05,508
In this, nobody has to tell you;

270
00:28:07,221 --> 00:28:10,221
it’s just there.

271
00:28:14,181 --> 00:28:18,621
You are there, you know what it is.

272
00:28:20,451 --> 00:28:28,501
And this is what you have
achieved in these modern times,

273
00:28:29,181 --> 00:28:32,771
which is the blessing
of the modern times also,

274
00:28:33,191 --> 00:28:38,151
that we know now who we are.

275
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:44,020
You always say, “We are the pure
Spirit,” yesterday also I heard it.

276
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:46,255
Are you sure?

277
00:28:47,011 --> 00:28:50,791
What makes you believe that,

278
00:28:51,558 --> 00:28:55,388
that you are the pure Spirit?

279
00:28:56,405 --> 00:28:59,945
I mean, you haven’t seen
your Spirit, have you?

280
00:29:00,555 --> 00:29:03,655
You haven’t seen yourself
what you are.

281
00:29:04,488 --> 00:29:07,428
Then how do you say you
are the pure Spirit?

282
00:29:07,938 --> 00:29:14,338
It’s just you are saying
something because I say so.

283
00:29:16,657 --> 00:29:22,577
But you are the pure Spirit,
because whatever the description

284
00:29:22,577 --> 00:29:25,047
of the pure Spirit is given

285
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:30,020
that it is aware

286
00:29:31,611 --> 00:29:37,111
of the divine Power.

287
00:29:38,661 --> 00:29:42,031
It is aware of the Divine Power,

288
00:29:42,711 --> 00:29:47,031
and that is how you
are the pure Spirit;

289
00:29:47,571 --> 00:29:50,861
because only
through pure Spirit

290
00:29:51,181 --> 00:29:53,841
as your personality

291
00:29:54,131 --> 00:30:01,841
you can be aware of this
All-pervading Power.

292
00:30:03,011 --> 00:30:10,161
This is written in all the 'shastras',
in all the scriptures, everywhere.

293
00:30:10,911 --> 00:30:14,011
And what do you know
about yourself?

294
00:30:15,571 --> 00:30:22,841
– that you are the Spirit, because
you know about your own chakras,

295
00:30:22,841 --> 00:30:26,171
you know about your own nadis.

296
00:30:26,895 --> 00:30:32,395
Now, what has happened is that
you are separated from your self

297
00:30:32,395 --> 00:30:36,505
and you can see your self.

298
00:30:37,815 --> 00:30:41,995
You see yourself very clearly,

299
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:53,500
and you start seeing yourself as the
present and the past and the future.

300
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:58,751
“In the past what I was”
– you see, you’re shocked now

301
00:30:59,031 --> 00:31:01,551
“my goodness, I was like this.”

302
00:31:01,941 --> 00:31:05,981
You see it through this
present state,

303
00:31:06,261 --> 00:31:09,391
in the present state you see.

304
00:31:09,973 --> 00:31:16,473
Then you start forgetting it,
“Forget the past, forget the past.”

305
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:23,013
Then still you have the future;

306
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:29,290
then you start thinking
about the future.

307
00:31:30,268 --> 00:31:36,423
First future they think about their
 own children, their wives - Sahaja Yogis also.

308
00:31:36,948 --> 00:31:43,668
“What will happen to my children?
What will happen to my wife?”

309
00:31:44,923 --> 00:31:49,753
Then they think, “What will
happen to Sahaja Yoga?”

310
00:31:50,635 --> 00:31:54,475
Then they think, “What
will happen to Mataji?”

311
00:31:55,905 --> 00:32:00,205
Also they think, “What will
happen to this world?”

312
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:09,627
Because your awareness
has expanded,

313
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,760
you are not in the limited
sphere now anymore.

314
00:32:17,548 --> 00:32:20,388
You can think of your children,
you can think of your wife,

315
00:32:20,388 --> 00:32:23,868
also you can think
of the whole world

316
00:32:24,895 --> 00:32:29,885
and all the problems of
the world you think about.

317
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:35,480
So you have reached
that state, all right;

318
00:32:35,963 --> 00:32:39,113
up to that state we are.

319
00:32:40,055 --> 00:32:42,945
Now what is the thing

320
00:32:45,591 --> 00:32:51,281
that covers up all this
or gives you solutions,

321
00:32:51,551 --> 00:32:55,931
say, for your children, for your
family, your wife, everyone

322
00:32:56,191 --> 00:32:58,621
– what is the solution?

323
00:33:00,091 --> 00:33:05,511
Your Mother believes in giving
solutions, not only the problems

324
00:33:06,701 --> 00:33:10,191
Because these days
there are not problems

325
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:14,261
that existed in the Navaratri.

326
00:33:15,981 --> 00:33:18,261
They no more exist,

327
00:33:18,571 --> 00:33:25,141
that you can take a sword
in your hand and go and

328
00:33:25,421 --> 00:33:27,961
kill someone; no, it doesn’t,

329
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:32,541
it’s not possible – cut what?

330
00:33:33,811 --> 00:33:38,821
So the today’s problem
as they are, as we see

331
00:33:40,561 --> 00:33:44,491
– within us we see the problems,

332
00:33:44,741 --> 00:33:49,511
we are aware of it and we
want to do something about it.

333
00:33:50,431 --> 00:33:53,801
Whether we are in the past,
present or future,

334
00:33:54,081 --> 00:33:56,831
we see the problem.

335
00:34:00,781 --> 00:34:04,091
So now what is the solution?

336
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:13,571
We have no weapons,
nothing to fight.

337
00:34:15,301 --> 00:34:17,481
We don’t know also,
so many do not

338
00:34:17,761 --> 00:34:21,401
know even how to hold
a sword in the hand,

339
00:34:21,981 --> 00:34:25,161
and so many don’t
even want to hold it;

340
00:34:26,441 --> 00:34:29,281
because they are so
much in compassion,

341
00:34:29,581 --> 00:34:33,051
in the ocean of compassion
enjoying themselves nicely.

342
00:34:34,351 --> 00:34:37,841
They are enjoying their own
compassion and compassion of others,

343
00:34:38,131 --> 00:34:40,721
compassion of their Mother.

344
00:34:41,331 --> 00:34:44,851
But then how to solve the problem?

345
00:34:50,051 --> 00:34:52,651
The problem can be solved

346
00:34:52,881 --> 00:34:58,261
if you become very
powerful yourself within.

347
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:04,441
Where is your attention?

348
00:35:08,071 --> 00:35:10,961
You have to move inward.

349
00:35:11,411 --> 00:35:13,791
Where is your attention?

350
00:35:15,331 --> 00:35:19,241
You have to become very powerful.

351
00:35:20,271 --> 00:35:25,041
I have done My job, I have
given you realization.

352
00:35:26,021 --> 00:35:29,781
You have grown so much,
I have explained to you,

353
00:35:30,031 --> 00:35:32,831
I’ve told you everything
– it’s done.

354
00:35:33,341 --> 00:35:37,091
I have given you lots of love,

355
00:35:37,351 --> 00:35:41,931
ocean of love, I should say,
as you call it, whatever it is.

356
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:47,490
But now you have to
nourish yourself.

357
00:35:48,621 --> 00:35:53,141
You have to become
powerful within yourself.

358
00:35:55,393 --> 00:35:59,473
So what is the way you
can become powerful?

359
00:36:04,405 --> 00:36:06,905
First, you must believe

360
00:36:07,841 --> 00:36:12,561
that you have transcended
your human personality

361
00:36:12,841 --> 00:36:18,371
and you have now become
a super-human being.

362
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:27,350
First of all, this must come in you.

363
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:31,275
This is what we call as faith.

364
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:37,011
This faith is not false
faith, is not blind faith

365
00:36:37,301 --> 00:36:43,171
that you believe into
something, but it’s a fact.

366
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:48,081
I have a hundred times,
I have told you

367
00:36:48,391 --> 00:36:53,481
that you have first of all
faith in your ascent

368
00:36:53,751 --> 00:36:57,741
in your position as Sahaja Yogis.

369
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:06,753
For this meditation is
very important, very important.

370
00:37:07,015 --> 00:37:12,655
Without meditation you cannot
have full faith in yourself,

371
00:37:13,892 --> 00:37:21,099
because you can’t know yourself
by saying, “Who am I?” You cannot.

372
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:28,870
You try now. Ask a question within,
“Who am I?” You’ll be lost.

373
00:37:36,891 --> 00:37:38,521
So what should be the faith then?

374
00:37:38,761 --> 00:37:43,341
Because when you ask the question
“Who am I?” you are lost.

375
00:37:50,541 --> 00:37:54,071
So we reach a stage
where I have to tell you

376
00:37:54,351 --> 00:38:01,691
that faith is not mental, it is
not emotional, it is not physical,

377
00:38:02,051 --> 00:38:08,441
but it is a state of your own being

378
00:38:09,201 --> 00:38:13,921
which we can call as
a spiritual state.

379
00:38:18,751 --> 00:38:22,041
In the spiritual state

380
00:38:24,671 --> 00:38:30,291
nothing can disturb you,

381
00:38:32,491 --> 00:38:35,741
nothing can overpower you,

382
00:38:36,561 --> 00:38:39,871
nothing can dominate you;

383
00:38:42,061 --> 00:38:45,461
because that state if you have,

384
00:38:45,821 --> 00:38:52,301
that means you are part
and parcel of reality.

385
00:38:53,561 --> 00:39:01,441
Then you are a honored member
of the God’s kingdom.

386
00:39:03,501 --> 00:39:12,331
Then you are the most
revered personality.

387
00:39:13,921 --> 00:39:17,131
Then you are like a deity.

388
00:39:18,451 --> 00:39:21,691
Then you are like a Gana.

389
00:39:23,331 --> 00:39:28,051
In that state when you are
– it’s a state, again I say,

390
00:39:28,761 --> 00:39:32,411
beyond the human state

391
00:39:34,471 --> 00:39:39,101
– you are extremely powerful.

392
00:39:45,651 --> 00:39:49,301
There’s a story about
Nizamuddin – the great Auliya,

393
00:39:49,591 --> 00:39:52,501
great Sufi in India.

394
00:39:52,941 --> 00:39:55,691
There was a horrible king

395
00:39:55,991 --> 00:39:59,301
I think what Shah he called himself;

396
00:39:59,931 --> 00:40:05,161
and he would not go and bow
to him. So he was very angry.

397
00:40:05,441 --> 00:40:09,081
He said, “I can only bow
to God and to nobody else.”

398
00:40:10,681 --> 00:40:14,671
This Shah said, “If you don’t come
and bow to me tomorrow,

399
00:40:14,921 --> 00:40:18,171
I will cut your throat.”

400
00:40:18,901 --> 00:40:23,471
And that night, the throat
of this king was cut.

401
00:40:24,451 --> 00:40:28,881
It’s a story, but it’s a real story.

402
00:40:30,791 --> 00:40:36,221
Somebody came and cut his throat
– it was not Nizamuddin Sahib.

403
00:40:36,501 --> 00:40:39,631
He would not do that.

404
00:40:42,151 --> 00:40:46,131
So that state if you reach,

405
00:40:47,561 --> 00:40:53,351
what we call is
the state of shraddha,

406
00:40:53,661 --> 00:41:00,961
state of shraddha

407
00:41:01,281 --> 00:41:07,711
which is enlightened,
enlightened faith.

408
00:41:09,711 --> 00:41:17,181
It’s a new type of mechanism;

409
00:41:19,851 --> 00:41:27,251
that is, you become part
and parcel of the whole.

410
00:41:28,401 --> 00:41:31,991
That means the moon, the star- see

411
00:41:33,021 --> 00:41:37,591
I tell you, I never told the sun that
it should be there for the pujas -

412
00:41:37,881 --> 00:41:40,511
last time, this time - I never tell him.

413
00:41:40,821 --> 00:41:45,161
There’s no need to tell,
it’s all done.

414
00:41:47,621 --> 00:41:51,211
I don’t tell all these vibrations

415
00:41:51,511 --> 00:41:57,491
to make a cross or to show these,
all these miraculous photographs.

416
00:41:57,751 --> 00:42:01,291
I don´t tell them, there´s no need to tell.

417
00:42:04,371 --> 00:42:08,321
They just do it by themselves.
I am sometimes surprised

418
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:11,441
how ingenious methods
they have of their own,

419
00:42:11,701 --> 00:42:15,101
how they manage things
– I am myself surprised.

420
00:42:16,141 --> 00:42:19,041
I didn’t tell them that
these two persons

421
00:42:19,321 --> 00:42:21,341
who were selected by this award

422
00:42:21,591 --> 00:42:25,501
should be so condemned
by every newspaper.

423
00:42:25,891 --> 00:42:29,201
It all works automatically,

424
00:42:32,711 --> 00:42:35,431
it just works.

425
00:42:35,791 --> 00:42:41,671
Only thing if I have anything is
just complete, complete faith

426
00:42:41,941 --> 00:42:44,791
that I am at that state,

427
00:42:45,381 --> 00:42:50,081
and that’s why there is
complete patience, 'saburi',

428
00:42:50,671 --> 00:42:53,131
complete patience.

429
00:42:58,371 --> 00:43:02,181
And that is what we have to learn.

430
00:43:03,301 --> 00:43:09,391
It will all happen in any case
because you are all at that state.

431
00:43:10,071 --> 00:43:13,531
Only meditation is important,
very important;

432
00:43:13,811 --> 00:43:16,901
for Me not, but for you all.

433
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:20,741
If you all can meditate now,

434
00:43:21,361 --> 00:43:28,541
just for ten minutes also every day,

435
00:43:29,461 --> 00:43:31,921
it will help you a lot.

436
00:43:32,971 --> 00:43:39,601
Now, why do we have all these
statues and, I mean the Mother

437
00:43:40,171 --> 00:43:45,051
and the Hanumana
and Ganesha, Christ?

438
00:43:45,751 --> 00:43:48,891
Because to begin with,
human beings cannot

439
00:43:48,891 --> 00:43:53,771
understand anything which
does not have a form.

440
00:43:55,366 --> 00:44:00,676
They cannot go deeper unless
and until there’s a form.

441
00:44:01,313 --> 00:44:04,301
But they went to another
limit of using any stone,

442
00:44:04,301 --> 00:44:08,631
anything, as God and all that.

443
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:12,541
But now you have discretion:

444
00:44:12,911 --> 00:44:15,401
you know what is to be worshipped,

445
00:44:15,691 --> 00:44:24,471
what is to be treated as a higher
personality – that you know.

446
00:44:24,991 --> 00:44:29,631
But before that they would
worship all kinds of people,

447
00:44:29,881 --> 00:44:34,101
like now people worship pope,
you know that very well.

448
00:44:35,291 --> 00:44:36,971
But now what to do?

449
00:44:37,521 --> 00:44:40,521
They are not only blind,

450
00:44:40,861 --> 00:44:46,281
they are not only unaware, but
they are also not conscious of it.

451
00:44:47,471 --> 00:44:51,951
They are all at such a level
that you cannot tell them.

452
00:44:52,901 --> 00:44:55,981
So you are a new type
of people I should say,

453
00:44:56,271 --> 00:45:01,001
who have tried to fight
it out, to struggle out,

454
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:05,891
to know about the absolute truth.

455
00:45:07,611 --> 00:45:12,361
Unless and until you know
the absolute truth,

456
00:45:13,381 --> 00:45:15,321
you are nowhere;

457
00:45:15,901 --> 00:45:21,701
you have no discretion, you have no
understanding, you have no wisdom.

458
00:45:22,981 --> 00:45:25,661
But once you know the absolute truth,

459
00:45:26,001 --> 00:45:31,351
then you should not by any chance

460
00:45:32,261 --> 00:45:35,211
be halfway this and halfway that.

461
00:45:35,911 --> 00:45:42,841
That’s a very dangerous
state of affairs.

462
00:45:43,201 --> 00:45:50,591
Say a seed is sprouted, it is
neither a seed nor a tree.

463
00:45:53,281 --> 00:45:57,171
If it doesn’t grow it is useless.

464
00:45:57,611 --> 00:46:00,871
That’s happens to your
awareness – I am again talking

465
00:46:01,191 --> 00:46:04,471
of your consciousness, awareness

466
00:46:08,021 --> 00:46:13,811
– and then you are neither
here nor there.

467
00:46:14,421 --> 00:46:21,161
There are many people who come
to Sahaja Yoga perhaps, maybe

468
00:46:21,911 --> 00:46:25,061
to find some peace.

469
00:46:25,711 --> 00:46:27,931
But I get letters:

470
00:46:28,181 --> 00:46:32,601
“My father is sick, my mother is
sick, my sister is sick.”

471
00:46:32,911 --> 00:46:37,711
Then otherwise, “My husband is fighting
with me, I am seeking a divorce.”

472
00:46:38,071 --> 00:46:40,201
Or thirdly, “I’ve lost all my money,

473
00:46:40,441 --> 00:46:43,081
I must have some money.”

474
00:46:43,431 --> 00:46:45,981
Fourthly, “I am a great artist but I,

475
00:46:46,221 --> 00:46:48,971
my art is not selling.”

476
00:46:49,251 --> 00:46:54,301
All these stupid problems
they bring for Me.

477
00:46:54,631 --> 00:46:59,791
Hah – “My children are no good,
they are troublesome.”

478
00:47:00,081 --> 00:47:02,011
Then, “My wife is fighting with me,

479
00:47:02,271 --> 00:47:04,951
my mother is fighting with
me, brother is fighting.”

480
00:47:05,191 --> 00:47:09,771
But I said, “What sort
of Sahaja yogis these are?”

481
00:47:13,881 --> 00:47:19,361
The state of being one
with the reality

482
00:47:22,181 --> 00:47:28,121
means that the whole
of reality is at your feet,

483
00:47:29,671 --> 00:47:32,321
whole of it works for you;

484
00:47:33,281 --> 00:47:38,281
and once you even
get a glimpse of that state

485
00:47:38,561 --> 00:47:45,781
I tell you, you become so much
peaceful within yourself.

486
00:47:51,151 --> 00:47:54,951
If you say, “I am the king,
I am the king,”

487
00:47:55,401 --> 00:47:58,491
if you say, “I am the beggar,
I am the beggar,”

488
00:47:58,811 --> 00:48:01,951
what difference does it
make to that state

489
00:48:02,241 --> 00:48:07,431
which is like a purest of pure gold,

490
00:48:07,891 --> 00:48:11,541
which cannot be tarnished?

491
00:48:14,831 --> 00:48:18,651
Such a state of mind
we have to develop.

492
00:48:20,081 --> 00:48:23,901
It’s a more a challenge to us.

493
00:48:24,641 --> 00:48:27,521
We are Sahaja yogis, all right.

494
00:48:28,161 --> 00:48:31,111
We have got realization, all right.

495
00:48:31,741 --> 00:48:34,861
We can sing very well, all right.

496
00:48:35,221 --> 00:48:38,651
We have achieved good
positions, all right.

497
00:48:39,581 --> 00:48:42,551
We are nicely married, all right.

498
00:48:43,121 --> 00:48:46,021
We’ve got nice children,
we have got everything,

499
00:48:46,291 --> 00:48:48,511
we have got jobs, this that.

500
00:48:48,831 --> 00:48:55,711
Now, suddenly one negative force
comes in to trouble you – so what?

501
00:48:59,441 --> 00:49:01,441
So what?

502
00:49:04,581 --> 00:49:09,181
Otherwise how will you
know what you are?

503
00:49:10,671 --> 00:49:15,041
If there is no darkness, how will
you know you are the light?

504
00:49:17,281 --> 00:49:27,221
It’s a challenge to your own
state, at what state you are.

505
00:49:28,181 --> 00:49:33,641
The word “state” is not so
explanatory. In Sanskrit is swarupa,

506
00:49:34,061 --> 00:49:36,261
swarupa

507
00:49:39,191 --> 00:49:46,101
– “swa” is yourself
and “rupa” is form or state.

508
00:49:47,821 --> 00:49:53,861
That state is possible
for all of you

509
00:49:56,011 --> 00:50:00,841
by saying “Not this, not this,
not this, not this.”

510
00:50:03,781 --> 00:50:11,011
As it is, your mind has reached
that state that there is no mind

511
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:13,681
– you can do that.

512
00:50:14,341 --> 00:50:20,611
But you have to develop
a kind of a personality

513
00:50:21,061 --> 00:50:24,841
that realizes what you are.

514
00:50:28,051 --> 00:50:31,791
But in that realization

515
00:50:33,981 --> 00:50:36,891
you are just aware of it,

516
00:50:37,181 --> 00:50:39,161
not conscious of it.

517
00:50:39,481 --> 00:50:42,161
I´ll, for example, I'll tell you.

518
00:50:43,351 --> 00:50:47,241
I am aware that I am Adi Shakti
– I am aware, I know.

519
00:50:47,601 --> 00:50:52,971
But when you say “Jai Shri Mataji”
I also say “Jai Shri Mataji,”

520
00:50:53,261 --> 00:50:57,771
forgetting that I am the
one you are talking about.

521
00:51:00,621 --> 00:51:06,041
This is actually,
should be the state:

522
00:51:07,231 --> 00:51:10,881
that you are aware, yes, you
are aware in the sense, in the

523
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:14,651
- I don’t know how to say
- but I am aware I am that.

524
00:51:14,901 --> 00:51:17,311
If you ask Me, “Mother,
are You Adi Shakti?”

525
00:51:17,571 --> 00:51:24,231
I said, “Yes, I am” - because
I know that, that I am.

526
00:51:24,641 --> 00:51:27,951
But when you say
“Jai Shri Mataji” I forget that

527
00:51:28,201 --> 00:51:33,241
I am Adi Shakti and I also say
“Jai Shri Mataji” with you.

528
00:51:36,711 --> 00:51:42,081
I forget, I have to tell you,
“No, no, you can't say it”.

529
00:51:43,931 --> 00:51:45,221
It’s very interesting.

530
00:51:45,531 --> 00:51:49,271
Now, you make Me sit
here like a queen

531
00:51:49,591 --> 00:51:52,371
and give Me a presents,
this thing, that thing;

532
00:51:52,641 --> 00:51:57,484
I mean, all right, that’s your idea.

533
00:51:59,998 --> 00:52:08,458
But to Me, you see, I am
complete in Myself, I think so.

534
00:52:10,941 --> 00:52:16,061
This in Hindi: “Me kahenge ki
hum apne hi andar samma gaye”

535
00:52:17,221 --> 00:52:22,581
"I am - got lost into Myself".

536
00:52:22,851 --> 00:52:26,231
All right, you do this, all right;
you should do that, all right.

537
00:52:26,511 --> 00:52:30,279
If you don’t do it, it’s all right.

538
00:52:31,501 --> 00:52:35,571
To Me it makes no difference;
it may make difference to you,

539
00:52:35,571 --> 00:52:37,501
but to Me it does not.

540
00:52:37,791 --> 00:52:43,061
Like, I´ve been saying, "Now don´t give me any presents,
don´t give me any presents", all these days.

541
00:52:43,241 --> 00:52:45,391
So the only argument is that,

542
00:52:45,391 --> 00:52:49,191
“The whole year, we give You once,
so why should You, Mother, object?

543
00:52:49,191 --> 00:52:51,001
because that gives us joy.”

544
00:52:51,271 --> 00:52:54,031
All right, if you think
it gives you joy, do it,

545
00:52:54,341 --> 00:52:57,711
but to Me, it doesn’t matter.

546
00:53:01,921 --> 00:53:05,541
Because I don’t think I am there.

547
00:53:08,021 --> 00:53:13,041
I am just seeing you
sitting here, all right.

548
00:53:13,311 --> 00:53:17,620
They are all Realized souls, all right.

549
00:53:19,301 --> 00:53:22,685
But I am one of you.

550
00:53:23,281 --> 00:53:26,221
I don’t think I am very special.

551
00:53:26,961 --> 00:53:31,531
But if you ask Me then I will say,
"All right, I am Adi Shakti".

552
00:53:31,801 --> 00:53:36,362
But I don’t think Adi Shakti
is very special also,

553
00:53:38,330 --> 00:53:40,630
because I’ve no mind.

554
00:53:41,321 --> 00:53:43,611
But otherwise, I don’t think
it’s something special.

555
00:53:43,871 --> 00:53:47,271
Because somebody is
something, so what?

556
00:53:48,341 --> 00:53:53,871
Now supposing sun is
sun, so what? He is a sun.

557
00:53:55,121 --> 00:53:59,324
If somebody is Adi Shakti
– so Adi Shakti, so what?

558
00:54:00,135 --> 00:54:07,008
But for you it is creditable
because you were not born Realized.

559
00:54:07,008 --> 00:54:10,634
You got your Realization.

560
00:54:10,826 --> 00:54:15,961
So you are special, you are great,

561
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:18,411
you have achieved something.
I’ve achieved nothing;

562
00:54:18,411 --> 00:54:23,061
I have been like this and
I will be like this.

563
00:54:24,793 --> 00:54:28,701
Whether I fight the devils
or I sit before you

564
00:54:28,701 --> 00:54:31,771
makes no difference,
I will be like this.

565
00:54:31,771 --> 00:54:37,731
But for Me you are great,
because you have achieved this.

566
00:54:37,731 --> 00:54:41,521
Today to see you
on this Navaratri day,

567
00:54:41,751 --> 00:54:46,950
so many people sitting
to worship Me!

568
00:54:48,421 --> 00:54:51,321
So many people are here,

569
00:54:51,591 --> 00:54:56,431
so many Sahaja Yogis
- it’s so remarkable!

570
00:54:56,941 --> 00:54:59,431
It’s not My achievement, I tell you,

571
00:54:59,651 --> 00:55:01,481
it’s your seeking.

572
00:55:01,701 --> 00:55:05,617
Because I have been on this
earth many a times before

573
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:08,901
that you know.

574
00:55:09,671 --> 00:55:11,881
But we never had like this.

575
00:55:12,161 --> 00:55:15,861
So many came, got crucified,
died, this, that,

576
00:55:16,101 --> 00:55:19,061
but I never had people of this kind.

577
00:55:21,198 --> 00:55:24,718
So again we come
to the same point,

578
00:55:25,661 --> 00:55:33,061
that we should be aware
of ourselves

579
00:55:34,691 --> 00:55:37,591
– complete shraddha
in yourself.

580
00:55:38,311 --> 00:55:41,741
If you have some shraddha
in yourself,

581
00:55:42,051 --> 00:55:45,299
you’ll have shraddha about Me also,

582
00:55:45,531 --> 00:55:49,491
because we are not different.

583
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:54,451
If you believe this is water,

584
00:55:54,721 --> 00:55:59,190
then everywhere there is water
I believe that that is water, isn’t it?

585
00:55:59,453 --> 00:56:02,461
Because I know this is water,

586
00:56:03,281 --> 00:56:07,871
so wherever in the world there
is water, I know it is water.

587
00:56:08,768 --> 00:56:12,111
So if you know you are
a Sahaja Yogi,

588
00:56:12,531 --> 00:56:19,153
anywhere there is a Sahaja Yogi, you know there is
a Sahaja Yogi, this is a Sahaja Yogi.

589
00:56:19,153 --> 00:56:27,231
But as far as you are concerned
you forget how great you are,

590
00:56:27,231 --> 00:56:30,161
and how far you can go.

591
00:56:30,161 --> 00:56:33,631
I am very proud of you,
you don’t know.

592
00:56:33,631 --> 00:56:39,441
But because I am a humble person,

593
00:56:39,631 --> 00:56:43,061
I don’t know how to show off.

594
00:56:44,141 --> 00:56:51,668
So, I have such nice children,
so many of them, so lovable.

595
00:56:52,703 --> 00:56:59,412
Those bhaktas for whom She killed
so many demons and all that

596
00:57:00,431 --> 00:57:02,751
were not like you.

597
00:57:03,061 --> 00:57:09,125
You are much better, much higher,
 of a much greater quality.

598
00:57:09,561 --> 00:57:13,761
But you must know that you are.

599
00:57:13,761 --> 00:57:19,541
And don’t behave like
those people who

600
00:57:19,943 --> 00:57:24,871
were of a very rudimentary nature.

601
00:57:25,371 --> 00:57:29,421
You are grown up,
you have prospered,

602
00:57:29,851 --> 00:57:34,147
and now the fruits we can see.

603
00:57:35,523 --> 00:57:39,181
I don’t know what to
do for you, really.

604
00:57:39,561 --> 00:57:44,483
But have faith in yourself.

605
00:57:45,481 --> 00:57:49,561
Then you will see how much
faith you will have in reality,

606
00:57:49,801 --> 00:57:53,341
that there is reality with
you at every step,

607
00:57:53,581 --> 00:57:56,261
every moment.

608
00:57:59,801 --> 00:58:01,901
No fear,

609
00:58:05,141 --> 00:58:08,725
no sense of achievement - nothing!

610
00:58:09,391 --> 00:58:12,550
Done now, finished!

611
00:58:13,061 --> 00:58:15,331
When there were 5 Sahaja Yogis,
 I was happy,

612
00:58:15,331 --> 00:58:17,421
when there are so many, I am happy.

613
00:58:17,421 --> 00:58:23,061
But I, when I see so many, I think

614
00:58:24,191 --> 00:58:32,745
there are so many powerful
personalities who are one with reality.

615
00:58:33,791 --> 00:58:40,995
This collective oneness
was never so.

616
00:58:41,526 --> 00:58:48,251
And so I would say that, on this day,

617
00:58:48,251 --> 00:58:54,341
what we have to do is to
kill the devils within ourselves;

618
00:58:54,548 --> 00:58:57,415
that’s all.

619
00:58:58,101 --> 00:59:01,001
If you want to really worship Me,

620
00:59:01,211 --> 00:59:05,818
that’s what you have to think,
what are the devils within you

621
00:59:05,818 --> 00:59:07,328
That’s all.

622
00:59:07,648 --> 00:59:10,879
So you don’t have to worry
otherwise for outside devils,

623
00:59:10,879 --> 00:59:14,170
they cannot do anything to you.

624
00:59:15,883 --> 00:59:19,432
May God bless you.
