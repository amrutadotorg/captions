1
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:16,040
Today we are here, all of us, to celebrate
the Diwali, that is dipavali, meaning the

2
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:30,970
rows of lights.

3
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:53,089
In the darkness of Kali Yuga when you find
from every place confusion of the worst type

4
00:00:53,089 --> 00:01:02,670
creating the darkness which cannot be penetrate
into, and which looks like a solid mountain

5
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:12,820
around us, and which can never be covered,
as we feel, by the grace of God.

6
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:20,300
And even with the grace of God it would never
melt.

7
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:37,340
In that darkness, in that hopeless state,
when the creation is on the verge of its destruction,

8
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,700
the light of Sahaja Yoga has arrived.

9
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:51,920
And you are the lights, you are the dipas,
you are the little, little lights, which were

10
00:01:51,920 --> 00:02:02,710
waiting to be enlightened, to be enlightened
to see for yourself what’s wrong within

11
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:09,500
your own lamp, what’s missing in your own
lamp.

12
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:15,190
Now, in the lamp you have three things, as
you see.

13
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,661
One is the container.

14
00:02:16,661 --> 00:02:30,550
Container is this body, container is this
mind and the container is this intellect.

15
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:37,320
And the container contains within us itself,
is the oil.

16
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:44,280
In Sanskrit language it’s called snigdha
or sneha, means the love.

17
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:53,740
Is the love that is within your mind, within
your body, within your existence itself.

18
00:02:53,740 --> 00:03:01,680
But this love is now limited, it is in a dormant
state.

19
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:11,280
It doesn’t express itself, it can spill
out in wrong directions, it may spoil some

20
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,590
things, which are beautiful.

21
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:19,120
This love, when it is limited, is very dangerous.

22
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:28,760
But when there is a third thing within you,
which we call as the baati, is the wick.

23
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:37,390
And this wick is the pure desire within you,
which is not yet lightened – it is not aware

24
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,950
of itself.

25
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:46,790
Nobody is aware, the lamp is not aware that
there is a light within itself.

26
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:54,710
All these three things have to combine to
give that light because we are lost in so

27
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,040
many things.

28
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:02,080
This darkness of Kali Yuga is not one-sided.

29
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:14,230
If you see it clearly it is not only materialism,
adherence to money, adherence to money-power,

30
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,769
it’s not only that.

31
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:22,160
That’s, of course, is very important these
days, we cannot neglect it, because that’s

32
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:32,470
something is really weighing this whole balance
of the Western world.

33
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:37,040
But this money is for power.

34
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,980
Why money?

35
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:43,460
Because it has a power, according to many
people who are blind.

36
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:53,440
They think money has the power to win-over
people, to exist in higher powers of, say,

37
00:04:53,440 --> 00:05:00,380
execution of their administration and all
that you need money.

38
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,380
To win our votes, to get elected.

39
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:07,840
That’s the myth people are carrying all
the time, that money is very important, and

40
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,200
without money you can’t manage things.

41
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:18,460
And also because of this kind of a misunderstanding
about money people get very much impressed

42
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:25,540
by the people who have money, and they think,
“Now, this is the time we must really gather

43
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,500
money somehow or other.”

44
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:32,640
Try to get money out of every kind of a adharma.

45
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,530
“What’s wrong?”

46
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:41,220
So this money orientation has gone in this
Kali Yuga to such a limit, that the sense

47
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:46,600
of chastity is lost, the sense of creativity
is lost – because you must create something

48
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,230
that must sell.

49
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:50,780
If it cannot sell then you should not.

50
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:55,570
Then, the sense of Dharma is lost, there is
no Dharma.

51
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:58,419
When it comes to making money, what is the
Dharma?

52
00:05:58,419 --> 00:06:00,560
There is no Dharma needed.

53
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,710
Only Dharma is how to make money.

54
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:07,340
Then, of course, the love.

55
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:12,560
The mothers don’t want children because
they have to spend money on their children.

56
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:18,340
It is the conceive, a selfishness that starts
working.

57
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:23,570
And people start thinking about, “How we
can grab money from others?”

58
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:28,670
There are many sophisticated ways of grabbing
money also in the modern times.

59
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:34,470
And the sophistication has reached such subtleties
that a person doesn’t know until he is completely

60
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,050
robbed.

61
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:47,110
Now, there are other ways of getting money,
is now that the kind of a music nowadays people

62
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:53,040
are having – which is against God – it
doesn’t sing the praise of God, but it’s

63
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,680
just a noise that they make.

64
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,280
If you sing the praise of God it’s different.

65
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:03,730
But otherwise this kind of music that they
have, actually works on your limbic area.

66
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:10,310
And the limbic area has the capacity to give
you joy and happiness, and this limbic area

67
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:17,480
becomes numb because of this music, of this
horrible music of modern times.

68
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:25,330
When it becomes numb then what you do is to
have more noise and more noise and more noise,

69
00:07:25,330 --> 00:08:12,270
to give a sensation to the limbic area.

70
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:19,320
So the limbic area when it becomes sensation-less
they don’t know how to give it a sensation,

71
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:25,410
so they take to drugs, you have to take to
drugs, you can’t help it, because all the

72
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:26,580
sensation is lost.

73
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:33,209
So, in the name of also anti-culture, or you
can call an anti-tradition, anti-this and

74
00:08:33,209 --> 00:08:42,409
anti-that, what you develop is a limbic area
which requires sensations.

75
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:48,980
Now the music fetches money, because it’s
like drug, it’s like any alcohol, it’s

76
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,629
any intoxication.

77
00:08:51,629 --> 00:08:57,139
Because already the nerves are intoxicated.

78
00:08:57,139 --> 00:09:07,250
Even alcohol works the same way, even other
things like drugs also work the same way.

79
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:12,850
So, in that intoxication you really do not
know what are you up to.

80
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:20,779
A kind of another darkness, another blindness
comes over.

81
00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:27,870
So in this darkness – this another additional
darkness makes people much more blind, much

82
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:31,279
more understanding.

83
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:39,790
This then takes us to the problem of the body
that exists, of the mind that exists, of the

84
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:42,330
intellect that exists.

85
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:51,019
When the whole thing is directed towards money-orientation
we put our body for sale.

86
00:09:51,019 --> 00:10:01,649
We want to make our body look like nothing
on earth, I could say, like some sort of a

87
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:07,910
tuberculosis patient as they say (Laughter),
or mosquitoes.

88
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:13,959
Because that makes people have some pity I
think, but inside exists a terribly, a shrew

89
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:18,189
type of a temperament in a man or a woman.

90
00:10:18,189 --> 00:10:24,189
The whole thing is done by entrepreneurs,
if you see that because they want to produce

91
00:10:24,189 --> 00:10:28,809
things and they want to create images by which
you have to live.

92
00:10:28,809 --> 00:10:35,689
And if you have to live with those images
you have to take to the kind of things they

93
00:10:35,689 --> 00:10:42,139
are producing and that’s how you try to
use those things and you become just a slave

94
00:10:42,139 --> 00:10:43,209
to those entrepreneurs.

95
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:51,540
It has gone too far – it has gone too far
into the production of things where you have

96
00:10:51,540 --> 00:11:01,459
to play into the hands of entrepreneurs.

97
00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:10,009
We have so many diseases in our country and
these diseases are very modern, meant only

98
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:11,339
for modern men.

99
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:16,970
In the older days people didn’t know these
diseases – must be having one or two, but

100
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:19,329
not many.

101
00:11:19,329 --> 00:11:26,509
So these diseases also come out of the fact
that most of the things we eat or most of

102
00:11:26,509 --> 00:11:35,660
the things we do are just the games of the
entrepreneurs.

103
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:42,009
Nothing fresh, nothing genuine, nothing sensible
is produced.

104
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:52,579
Wants are created that you must have at least
ten dresses, all made of pure plastic (Laughter)

105
00:11:52,579 --> 00:12:01,339
– which reacts, which reacts and which creates
problems.

106
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:13,629
Then you should have all kinds of other materials,
which are absolutely harmless and are anti-human

107
00:12:13,629 --> 00:12:15,149
beings.

108
00:12:15,149 --> 00:12:20,220
All machinery is for us, we are not for machinery.

109
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,230
So we have to give a balance.

110
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:29,069
Whatever we need can be done through the machinery,
but when machinery becomes the only source

111
00:12:29,069 --> 00:12:32,249
of exploitation it starts dominating us.

112
00:12:32,249 --> 00:12:41,910
See, if you go to the darkness of this Kali
Yuga – it’s so deep, it’s so horrid

113
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:47,819
and it’s so dangerous and destructive that
the description of it can take you to any

114
00:12:47,819 --> 00:12:56,529
land and you will not even feel that you are
getting into the mire deep, deep, deep into

115
00:12:56,529 --> 00:13:03,809
it, that you cannot come out of it.

116
00:13:03,809 --> 00:13:15,440
So the antidote has come now as Sahaja Yoga
– the Diwali, the dipavali of the Sahaja

117
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,519
Yogis.

118
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:21,829
See now, after Realization you don’t need
beauty-treatment much.

119
00:13:21,829 --> 00:13:30,040
You don’t need so many plastic clothes (Laughter).

120
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:39,059
You don’t indulge into all kinds of stupid
activities which are joyless.

121
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:41,139
You don’t take to drugs.

122
00:13:41,139 --> 00:13:43,009
You don’t take to smoking.

123
00:13:43,009 --> 00:13:50,730
You don’t take to alcohols and you don’t
take to this horrid music also.

124
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:59,800
On the contrary you take to the music that
pacifies, which sooths your limbic area, which

125
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,069
gives joy.

126
00:14:02,069 --> 00:14:09,870
So you indulge into all the pursuits which
will give you joy, start giving up gradually.

127
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:14,620
Sometimes I have to tell you but then you
understand and you give up all those things

128
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:19,860
because then you have tasted the joy, you
know what this joy is, you know the ambrosia

129
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,339
of joy, so you don’t want to give it up.

130
00:14:21,339 --> 00:14:26,040
You may, little bit, give it up, then again
you come back.

131
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,189
You know this is joy.

132
00:14:28,189 --> 00:14:33,139
Joy doesn’t lie in money, doesn’t lie
in all these joyless pursuits, nothing, but

133
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:39,259
joy lies in your Spirit, and the Spirit is
the one that enjoys the joy.

134
00:14:39,259 --> 00:14:50,279
So, this Spirit is the one, which you see
burning at the end of your Kundalini – on

135
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:52,079
top of your Sahasrara.

136
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:57,929
And you have seen the photograph, on top of
your Sahasrara you see the beautiful flame

137
00:14:57,929 --> 00:14:59,829
burning.

138
00:14:59,829 --> 00:15:01,220
You have seen that photograph.

139
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:08,360
It’s the proof that now you are all the
lights, and that you have to give lights to

140
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,050
others.

141
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,749
You have to help people.

142
00:15:11,749 --> 00:15:17,079
Now, all your faces look like roses, anybody
can see you and can make out that you are

143
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:18,559
something special people.

144
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:25,129
You are not like ordinary people who look
so miserable, horrible – and when you sing

145
00:15:25,129 --> 00:15:32,240
in that style also, you are singing God’s
sake, in every style, whatever you sing, which

146
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:38,989
was once upon a time was regarded as anti-God
singing becomes something great.

147
00:15:38,989 --> 00:15:47,579
So now the light of Sahaja Yoga has kindled
within you all these small, small lights,

148
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:53,600
which are going to enlighten the path for
humanity, for their emancipation.

149
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,790
So responsibility of Sahaja Yogis are great.

150
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:03,799
They should get over all these limitations,
like the light has got over all the limitations

151
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:05,939
and spread all over.

152
00:16:05,939 --> 00:16:13,550
If you have a way of measuring how far this
little light has gone you cannot measure it

153
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,589
with ordinary human instruments.

154
00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:23,329
But once it starts it is spread to the last
bit of it and comes back to it.

155
00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:34,310
In the same way this light which is kindled
within you spreads all over, is emitted all

156
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:37,579
over and comes back to you.

157
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:42,859
But of course it is just a material light.

158
00:16:42,859 --> 00:16:45,319
This is a spiritual light.

159
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:51,569
The difference is this light has its own power
of burning, that’s all.

160
00:16:51,569 --> 00:16:57,359
Also it has a power of giving some light in
the darkness.

161
00:16:57,359 --> 00:17:04,630
Also it has one more thing, that it can enlighten
another light.

162
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:13,470
But a Sahaja Yogi is not only the light himself,
but also the one who can go to others.

163
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,839
It cannot walk.

164
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:20,010
When it walks it is fire.

165
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:22,630
It cannot walk in it’s own limitations.

166
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:24,589
Somebody has to carry it.

167
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:31,610
So the Sahaja Yogis are the ones who can carry
this light within themselves – very well

168
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:37,760
preserved and very beautifully enlighten another
person.

169
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,820
Without creating a fire, without burning anything.

170
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:46,720
You move this from here to there one has to
think thrice if you can move because you may

171
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,290
spill something or you may burn something.

172
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:52,940
But not a Sahaja Yogi.

173
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:56,950
And it is for the redemption.

174
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:02,080
This can give you light, which is outside,
by which you can see only – but you cannot

175
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:08,019
feel and you cannot cure.

176
00:18:08,019 --> 00:18:18,340
You cannot give counsel, nor can you comfort
and you cannot redeem with this material.

177
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,570
It is spiritual light that is within us.

178
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:24,029
So today is a celebration of real Diwali.

179
00:18:24,029 --> 00:18:35,410
I always say that in India we were producing
the Diwali-lights with ordinary mud, but now,

180
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:43,260
in Sahaja Yoga, we have lotuses which are
giving light, the fragrance.

181
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:49,160
Such beautiful things they are and the way
you are enjoying it and expressing your joy

182
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,220
is so very beautiful.

183
00:18:52,220 --> 00:19:02,049
But to be the lotus you have to give up this
mud, this darkness – you have to give up

184
00:19:02,049 --> 00:19:03,049
that.

185
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:13,580
If you can’t give up that, then you cannot
enjoy your own lotus and others can’t enjoy.

186
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:16,130
So that giving-up is not difficult.

187
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:20,310
You see, when people say that, “You have
to love your Mother”, just means that you

188
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:24,760
give up your ego and your conditionings and
become a pure personality, that’s all.

189
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:29,769
I mean, in any case all of you love Me but
still under limitations.

190
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:36,580
You must love Me without limitations, then
it is a real love as I love you.

191
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:40,250
For this we have to thank this time.

192
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,529
This time is great.

193
00:19:41,529 --> 00:19:46,299
As I call it the blossom time, that at this
time you were all born and at this time I

194
00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:52,210
came and at this time this combination took
place and at this time Sahaja Yoga was established.

195
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:56,880
You don’t know, I have gone through very
great difficulties in the beginning.

196
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,350
Very great difficulties.

197
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:02,590
Because Sahaja Yoga cannot be understood by
idiots.

198
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:08,490
And first I met only idiots in My life (Laughter),
quite a lot of idiots.

199
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:11,570
As Christ has said, “The first will be the
last”, you see.

200
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:15,899
Perhaps those idiots that I’ve met have
created lots of problems for Me.

201
00:20:15,899 --> 00:20:18,350
But then real people started coming to Me.

202
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:24,860
They understood Sahaja Yoga, they took to
Sahaja Yog’ and it worked out very well.

203
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:28,049
Now we have plans to go to India.

204
00:20:28,049 --> 00:20:36,000
The speciality of Indian Tour is that India,
as you know, is a place of quite lot of work

205
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,220
done by the great saints, especially Maharashtra.

206
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:46,970
Apart from that it’s a very, very Holy Land,
no doubt about it, it’s very clean.

207
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:51,340
Still the people have not taken to materialism
to that extent.

208
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:56,920
And thirdly we have about eight pujas in such
a short time.

209
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,200
Of course, it is too much for Me, sometimes.

210
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:05,030
But we have eight pujas, and this is something
so intensive, one can do it.

211
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:11,049
This I can’t do anywhere else, as I can
do in India, because only in India the atmosphere,

212
00:21:11,049 --> 00:21:15,190
the vibrations are sucked in, much faster
they are sucked than anywhere.

213
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:20,889
Because the darkness is not so much there,
and the light spreads much faster, much more

214
00:21:20,889 --> 00:21:25,020
easily, and I can find it easier to work it
out.

215
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:30,140
I’m sure those days will come everywhere,
when you put up your lights and you start

216
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,320
working it out.

217
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:39,330
I must congratulate all of you that you are
the ones, who are stuck-on to this darkness

218
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:45,980
and have created such a light with such responsibility,
with such understanding, with all the struggles

219
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:53,049
you had to go through, getting out of your
very limited basic problems.

220
00:21:53,049 --> 00:21:58,950
It is remarkable the way you people have established
it, it’s unbelievable, because, you see,

221
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:05,220
you could have just said that, “This is
some philosophy, we don’t believe it.

222
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:08,669
This is something that we don’t understand.”

223
00:22:08,669 --> 00:22:12,960
But it’s so congenial to you, because you
have become the Spirit.

224
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,440
Christ has said the same thing, but how many
have understood Christ?

225
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,660
Nobody has understood Christ, I think, till
it came through Christianity.

226
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:25,490
When it came through Sahaja Yoga you have
understood who He was.

227
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:33,540
In the same way for all other great prophets,
all other great Incarnations, you had to come

228
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:38,870
to Sahaja Yoga, to see in that light how great
they were, how much work they have done for

229
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:43,220
us, how much they have established us, how
much we should be thankful to you.

230
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:48,529
I hope one day you can see all of them sitting
with us and you can locate them, wherever

231
00:22:48,529 --> 00:22:49,669
they are.

232
00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:55,750
Those eyes you should develop one day, to
see all that, which your camera can see, sometimes.

233
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,971
And in the same way you should be able to
see, it will be a very good idea.

234
00:22:58,971 --> 00:23:04,360
I think in Bogotha some of the Sahaja Yogis
did see the grace falling down, that’s all,

235
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,360
once.

236
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,130
But it will happen more and more.

237
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:14,960
Please try to improve your eye, in the sense
that, ‘Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes’.

238
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,900
Have no greed in your eye, for anything!

239
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:24,700
Try to remove the greed from your eye and
it will definitely start working out.

240
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:32,649
So this is the message for our eyes because
through the eyes you are the light.

241
00:23:32,649 --> 00:23:39,240
First thing that I have kindled is the light
in your eyes, and that’s what is the light

242
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:47,130
is to be improved, to be purified with love
– with the Divine Love.

243
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:48,549
May God bless you all!
