00:12:55.789 --> 00:13:18.419
First – we bow to Shri Ganesha
because Shri Ganesha is the source of innocence

00:13:18.419 --> 00:13:20.328
within us.

00:13:20.328 --> 00:13:30.069
So actually we bow to innocence within us.

00:13:30.069 --> 00:13:43.459
And this innocence is the one [that] gives
you the enlightenment.

00:13:43.459 --> 00:13:59.719
As I told you yesterday the light has innocence,
but this is innocent without knowledge.

00:13:59.719 --> 00:14:06.369
But your light is innocent with knowledge.

00:14:06.369 --> 00:14:14.569
We always think that the people who have got
knowledge can never be innocent, can never

00:14:14.569 --> 00:14:17.059
be simple.

00:14:17.059 --> 00:14:25.139
And the idea we have got about innocence is
that a innocent person is always deceived,

00:14:25.139 --> 00:14:34.789
can be befooled – and can be always taken
for granted.

00:14:34.789 --> 00:14:48.539
But innocence is a power; it is a power which
protects you, which gives you light of knowledge.

00:14:48.539 --> 00:15:01.099
Knowledge that we have in the worldly sense
is how to exploit others, how to cheat others,

00:15:01.099 --> 00:15:15.989
how to make money out of them, how to make
fun of others, how to look down upon others.

00:15:15.989 --> 00:15:25.389
But the light of innocence is the light by
which you know that love is the highest thing.

00:15:25.389 --> 00:15:37.379
And it teaches you how to love others, how
to care for others, how to be gentle about

00:15:37.379 --> 00:15:38.489
others.

00:15:38.489 --> 00:15:41.989
It also gives you the light within.

00:15:41.989 --> 00:15:47.649
It’s just the other way round of this Avidya
that we have in this world.

00:15:47.649 --> 00:15:50.418
Just the other way round.

00:15:50.418 --> 00:16:05.909
The Avidya outside teaches us competition,
how to put the other person down.

00:16:05.909 --> 00:16:13.129
Because it has fear, it is insecured.

00:16:13.129 --> 00:16:18.778
This knowledge is not secured – at all.

00:16:18.778 --> 00:16:25.719
If it had security it would not have behaved
like this.

00:16:25.719 --> 00:16:30.819
But the light of innocence knows everything.

00:16:30.819 --> 00:16:35.979
It has no fear.

00:16:35.979 --> 00:16:44.749
When we say ‘children are innocent’ we
mean to say that they have that power of innocence.

00:16:44.749 --> 00:16:53.549
Many times people have noticed if a child
falls from a height, it doesn’t die; while

00:16:53.549 --> 00:17:01.028
a young man may die with a much smaller height.

00:17:01.028 --> 00:17:03.189
And the child is not afraid while falling.

00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:13.479
He just enjoys, as if there is a parachute
coming down, you know, nicely.

00:17:13.479 --> 00:17:17.479
And then when he falls down, also he just
gets up, laughs, smiles at everyone.

00:17:17.479 --> 00:17:23.289
He doesn’t understand why everybody is worried.

00:17:23.289 --> 00:17:29.558
Because in that innocence he knows that he’s
looked after, he’s protected.

00:17:29.558 --> 00:17:39.548
He knows that there is a power, which is much
higher than him and he does not have to worry.

00:17:39.548 --> 00:17:47.438
Then we start putting ideas into the head
of the child, and that is how he starts losing

00:17:47.438 --> 00:18:00.898
his power of innocence and he becomes a coward,
he becomes a cunning fellow, he becomes an

00:18:00.898 --> 00:18:07.898
unrighteous personality.

00:18:07.898 --> 00:18:18.058
But still we would say that the innocence
of children is [the] innocence of ignorance,

00:18:18.058 --> 00:18:26.208
in a way, because they do not know the dangers
of life.

00:18:26.208 --> 00:18:39.298
But the light of innocence knows all the dangers,
and also knows how to get rid of it, also

00:18:39.298 --> 00:18:43.779
knows how to be away from such a person.

00:18:43.779 --> 00:18:59.878
There was a wise man, who was going on a staircase,
and there was a stupid man coming from the

00:18:59.878 --> 00:19:03.119
other side – foolish man.

00:19:03.119 --> 00:19:09.278
So foolish people are always aggressive, that
is one of the signs, because they have inferiority

00:19:09.278 --> 00:19:10.998
complex.

00:19:10.998 --> 00:19:17.869
So the foolish man says to the man who was
coming up, he says – [because] one had to

00:19:17.869 --> 00:19:23.408
move on one side – so he says, “I don’t
move for fools!”

00:19:23.408 --> 00:19:27.158
The foolish one says.

00:19:27.158 --> 00:19:34.419
So the wise man says, “I do,” and he moved.

00:19:34.419 --> 00:19:47.730
(Laughter) That’s how the light of innocence
tells you how far to go with a person, how

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:57.428
far to talk to a person, how far to indulge
in another person’s personality or his problems;

00:19:57.428 --> 00:19:59.958
otherwise he recedes.

00:19:59.958 --> 00:20:05.148
He understands that this gentleman is a stupid
fool so “I move for a fool like that.”

00:20:05.148 --> 00:20:13.138
He doesn’t pay attention to such a person,
he doesn’t bother about such a person.

00:20:13.138 --> 00:20:19.138
This is the light of innocence which gives
you discrimination.

00:20:19.138 --> 00:20:20.528
How far to go with others.

00:20:20.528 --> 00:20:24.928
I love a person, there are many, “I love
him”.

00:20:24.928 --> 00:20:25.928
Alright!

00:20:25.928 --> 00:20:31.888
The another person may kick you, may hit you,
may trouble you, may become absolutely horribly

00:20:31.888 --> 00:20:41.699
possessed, but still you are just mad in love
with that person, without any self-respect.

00:20:41.699 --> 00:20:48.548
This comes because there is no…you may be
innocent, in a way, in a worldly manner, but

00:20:48.548 --> 00:20:51.009
you are not enlightened and innocent.

00:20:51.009 --> 00:20:58.468
When you are enlightened and innocent then
your innocence is a power, which gives you,

00:20:58.468 --> 00:21:04.128
first thing, is discretion.

00:21:04.128 --> 00:21:10.778
Supposing you take a light in your hand – now
you know whether it is a snake or a rope,

00:21:10.778 --> 00:21:14.718
but if there is no light in your hand, you
cannot see.

00:21:14.718 --> 00:21:21.088
But even, supposing it’s a snake, you might
run away, or if you are a stupid fool, you’ll

00:21:21.088 --> 00:21:22.708
say, “Alright, come and bite me.

00:21:22.708 --> 00:21:30.119
I would like to see, how it works.”

00:21:30.119 --> 00:21:34.739
(Child laughs.

00:21:34.739 --> 00:21:43.359
Laughter) But if you are an enlightened person,
then you will tell the snake, “Now, let

00:21:43.359 --> 00:21:44.579
me be alone.

00:21:44.579 --> 00:21:45.579
Alright?

00:21:45.579 --> 00:21:46.579
Bye-bye.”

00:21:46.579 --> 00:21:51.049
(Laughter) And the snake will know and it
will go away.

00:21:51.049 --> 00:21:59.579
Or if the snake is a sinister one, you may
just look at the snake and snake might run

00:21:59.579 --> 00:22:00.729
off.

00:22:00.729 --> 00:22:09.329
So this power of innocence is a very, very
important thing, and that comes to us through

00:22:09.329 --> 00:22:12.919
our enlightenment alone.

00:22:12.919 --> 00:22:24.539
So we are, say, in a state which is ignorant
and innocent – innocent and ignorant.

00:22:24.539 --> 00:22:31.629
Then people are no more innocent nor ignorant,
but they are not enlightened – they become

00:22:31.629 --> 00:22:32.629
cunning!

00:22:32.629 --> 00:22:40.349
If they don’t have both the qualities – they
are neither ignorant, so-called, they have

00:22:40.349 --> 00:22:46.969
got knowledge, they are good at everything,
they are well known people, for their intelligence,

00:22:46.969 --> 00:22:50.649
brilliance, everything – so they are knowledgeable,
so-called.

00:22:50.649 --> 00:22:57.549
So such people we could call as the people
who have got the knowledge, in the worldly

00:22:57.549 --> 00:23:02.559
sense, but they have no innocence.

00:23:02.559 --> 00:23:08.179
So they start devising methods, the innocence
which is there, which puts a little control

00:23:08.179 --> 00:23:11.989
over such a mind, is lost.

00:23:11.989 --> 00:23:13.949
Because they think innocence is stupid, you
know?

00:23:13.949 --> 00:23:16.089
They don’t respect their innocence.

00:23:16.089 --> 00:23:23.089
So they start manoeuvring people, doing violent
things, doing harmful things, saying nasty,

00:23:23.089 --> 00:23:24.349
sarcastic things.

00:23:24.349 --> 00:23:33.019
All these things the brain starts working,
because it cannot get back to its innocence.

00:23:33.019 --> 00:23:36.479
So we don’t like such people later on, we
don’t want them.

00:23:36.479 --> 00:23:43.439
Then they develop ideas that, “We are higher
people, we are chosen people, we are better

00:23:43.439 --> 00:23:45.759
people,” then – they develop all these
ideas.

00:23:45.759 --> 00:23:48.909
Then they, all of them club together.

00:23:48.909 --> 00:23:55.129
So ignorance is added as a so-called knowledge,
you see.

00:23:55.129 --> 00:23:59.739
Inside is completely ignorance, outside is
knowledge.

00:23:59.739 --> 00:24:06.979
And added up – added up like that, they
do not want to seek their inside.

00:24:06.979 --> 00:24:14.759
And they are satisfied with their outside,
so-called knowledge.

00:24:14.759 --> 00:24:19.939
And they go ahead with it, and once they break
their heads, then they realise, “Oh God,

00:24:19.939 --> 00:24:21.209
what was it?

00:24:21.209 --> 00:24:25.399
Inside is all darkness.”

00:24:25.399 --> 00:24:36.509
We cannot live with all the windows closed
hermetically and the sun shining outside.

00:24:36.509 --> 00:24:47.109
We have to have light inside, to see for ourselves,
what are we, what are our powers, how far

00:24:47.109 --> 00:24:58.259
we can go, how we are working out ourselves,
our lives, our aims?

00:24:58.259 --> 00:25:08.119
Now the enlightenment, as the enlightenment
you see here is of these lights, is manifested

00:25:08.119 --> 00:25:17.889
within you as vibrations, as chaitanya, as
light.

00:25:17.889 --> 00:25:23.009
So the chaitanya itself is the light.

00:25:23.009 --> 00:25:31.019
But the difference between this light and
that light is such that this one will only

00:25:31.019 --> 00:25:35.639
tell you as far as your eyes are concerned.

00:25:35.639 --> 00:25:43.799
It will tell you that it is a stone, or it
is a wood, or it is a house, or it is a face

00:25:43.799 --> 00:25:54.199
of a man – anything, this light, but it
won’t be able to tell you whether this person

00:25:54.199 --> 00:26:02.889
is good or bad, whether this house is vibrated
or not, is auspicious or not.

00:26:02.889 --> 00:26:07.199
So it doesn’t give you auspiciousness, the
idea of auspiciousness.

00:26:07.199 --> 00:26:12.919
So we are talking of Ganesha’s innocence,
which gives us sense of auspiciousness, and

00:26:12.919 --> 00:26:19.639
ourselves also makes us auspicious.

00:26:19.639 --> 00:26:33.839
This is how the chaitanya itself is enlightenment,
chaitanya itself is enlightenment.

00:26:33.839 --> 00:26:40.709
It relates to you all the knowledge which
it has.

00:26:40.709 --> 00:26:48.599
Now imagine what a micro-arrangement it is
that the chaitanyas, which are small, small

00:26:48.599 --> 00:26:57.379
like, we can say, little round valayas, small,
small ones.

00:26:57.379 --> 00:27:08.939
They have intelligence in them, and discretion
built-in them to tell you whether a person

00:27:08.939 --> 00:27:13.909
is good or bad.

00:27:13.909 --> 00:27:18.019
You have got it, Sahaja Yoga, so in a simple
way.

00:27:18.019 --> 00:27:24.169
So we have not bothered to find out, what
your computer has got.

00:27:24.169 --> 00:27:33.609
It has got the knowledge now to know, not
only if the person is good or bad, but what

00:27:33.609 --> 00:27:36.979
troubles that person has got.

00:27:36.979 --> 00:27:49.359
Now this light can go up to one dimension
of a person, how he looks, how he walks, everything.

00:27:49.359 --> 00:28:01.829
And you, if you start imagining something,
if you start imagining – and saying that,

00:28:01.829 --> 00:28:05.379
“I feel this way, I think this way.”

00:28:05.379 --> 00:28:10.609
(somebody interrupts Mother’s talk)

00:28:10.609 --> 00:28:13.959
Shri Mataji: not all right?

00:28:13.959 --> 00:28:14.959
Yogini: [inaudible]

00:28:14.959 --> 00:28:15.959
Shri Mataji: Ha?

00:28:15.959 --> 00:28:16.959
Yogini: [inaudible]

00:28:16.959 --> 00:28:18.599
Shri Mataji: You can’t hear Me?

00:28:18.599 --> 00:28:19.919
Many yogis: Yes.

00:28:19.919 --> 00:28:22.559
Upstairs only in the baby school.

00:28:22.559 --> 00:28:24.749
Shri Mataji: What is it?

00:28:24.749 --> 00:28:31.699
Akbar: There is a video for the mothers with
the children, and they can’t hear You.

00:28:31.699 --> 00:28:34.559
It is upstairs.

00:28:34.559 --> 00:28:43.789
Shri Mataji: I didn’t hear, what is it?

00:28:43.789 --> 00:28:53.769
Antonio Scialo: There is a children-room upstairs,
for children, with a video for children and

00:28:53.769 --> 00:28:54.769
mothers.

00:28:54.769 --> 00:28:55.769
But they cannot hear it.

00:28:55.769 --> 00:28:56.769
Shri Mataji: Oh I see, but the children are
here?

00:28:56.769 --> 00:29:00.579
Yogis: Babies, babies; mothers and babies.

00:29:00.579 --> 00:29:03.559
Shri Mataji: Oh God.

00:29:03.559 --> 00:29:16.249
Somebody has to go up and fix it up, isn’t
it?

00:29:16.249 --> 00:29:27.759
I think you should have tested it before,
isn’t it?

00:29:27.759 --> 00:29:29.689
Alright.

00:29:29.689 --> 00:29:46.139
So, the chaitanya that is within us, which
is flowing out, which we are receiving from

00:29:46.139 --> 00:30:03.768
all over, is all-pervading, is in every molecule
pulsating: which gives us knowledge about

00:30:03.768 --> 00:30:12.368
each and every matter, each and every animal,
each and every human being, and each and every

00:30:12.368 --> 00:30:16.228
Deity.

00:30:16.228 --> 00:30:26.868
Without this light you could not have recognised
Me.

00:30:26.868 --> 00:30:31.459
You could not have recognised any Deities.

00:30:31.459 --> 00:30:38.959
You could not have known your position in
life and your aims in life.

00:30:38.959 --> 00:30:45.458
You would not have known what is your purpose
of life, why are you here.

00:30:45.458 --> 00:30:49.199
Are you here just to make some money, put
some in the insurance, some in the shares?

00:30:49.199 --> 00:30:50.199
Of course, now nobody will do that!

00:30:50.199 --> 00:30:55.800
(The stock markets crashed on Monday 19 October
1987 the week of this puja) (Laughter) And

00:30:55.800 --> 00:31:03.319
get some house, and dance on the fingers of
your wife, or the wife has to dance as the

00:31:03.319 --> 00:31:12.328
dictates of the husband, to bring up children
somehow – are you here for that?

00:31:12.328 --> 00:31:19.208
This chaitanya tells you, very clearly, “No.”

00:31:19.208 --> 00:31:31.449
Because if you get more involved into these
things and become completely cut-off from

00:31:31.449 --> 00:31:37.718
the collective happenings, then this light
goes off.

00:31:37.718 --> 00:31:46.238
As soon as this light gets disconnected, you
can’t have any light.

00:31:46.238 --> 00:32:01.449
So, any connection, whatever you have, with
the vibrations has to be very strong, and

00:32:01.449 --> 00:32:04.569
has to be absolutely intact and steady.

00:32:04.569 --> 00:32:11.899
For example, if there is a light which is
not steady, which is moving, you can’t understand

00:32:11.899 --> 00:32:14.758
things properly.

00:32:14.758 --> 00:32:23.718
Though the vibrations know everything, but
how will they communicate this to an instrument

00:32:23.718 --> 00:32:40.888
which is not perfect, which does not respect
vibrations, which does not communicate with

00:32:40.888 --> 00:32:45.649
the vibrations?

00:32:45.649 --> 00:32:47.399
Please take the child out.

00:32:47.399 --> 00:32:51.888
Don’t try to push the – no, no, no, don’t
do that.

00:32:51.888 --> 00:32:53.439
No, no, don’t.

00:32:53.439 --> 00:32:56.049
You should not lose temper with children,
you know?

00:32:56.049 --> 00:33:13.099
They are crying, they must be wanting something.

00:33:13.099 --> 00:33:35.368
So, this knowledgeable instrument that you
have got is to be all the time flowing through

00:33:35.368 --> 00:33:40.929
you, and you have to be a very clean apparatus.

00:33:40.929 --> 00:33:51.959
Supposing you have this light, and the glass
is not clean – you won’t get light properly.

00:33:51.959 --> 00:34:02.929
So the purity has to be established, and that
is the part, where Ganesha is so important,

00:34:02.929 --> 00:34:12.988
because He cleanses you, He washes you and
you become innocent: because you do not plan

00:34:12.988 --> 00:34:21.628
or think of harming anyone, who is a good
person, who is a nice person.

00:34:21.628 --> 00:34:27.779
It becomes innocence because it is auspicious.

00:34:27.779 --> 00:34:30.069
You start becoming auspicious.

00:34:30.069 --> 00:34:37.559
Wherever you go, and [if] you meet somebody
that person feels, “Oh God, today something

00:34:37.559 --> 00:34:39.748
good has happened in our family.

00:34:39.748 --> 00:34:43.008
Something good has come out.”

00:34:43.008 --> 00:34:49.988
Now recently I met someone in Germany where
there was a ‘sahaja yogi’ who started

00:34:49.988 --> 00:34:53.679
talking against Me and Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:53.679 --> 00:35:00.998
And he got out of the Ashram, and then he
went to somebody who was supposed to be a

00:35:00.998 --> 00:35:06.008
sahaja yogi, and his wife, and there he started
telling about his woes and, against Sahaja

00:35:06.008 --> 00:35:08.618
Yoga and all those things.

00:35:08.618 --> 00:35:13.958
Though he has been always a possessed man,
but still: these people should not have listened

00:35:13.958 --> 00:35:15.649
to anything against Me.

00:35:15.649 --> 00:35:22.449
In the shastras is written, that: to hear
the Guru-ninda, anything against your Guru,

00:35:22.449 --> 00:35:25.098
is absolutely dangerous.

00:35:25.098 --> 00:35:29.518
So anybody says anything against your Guru,
you have to put your hands like that, “I

00:35:29.518 --> 00:35:32.738
don’t want to hear anything against my Guru!”

00:35:32.738 --> 00:35:34.169
Instead of that they sympathised.

00:35:34.169 --> 00:35:43.359
So the lady has got a serious type of cancer,
and the husband is also very sick.

00:35:43.359 --> 00:35:53.349
Now, one has to understand that if you are
going to cross this ocean in a boat – all

00:35:53.349 --> 00:36:01.159
of us are there – and [if] one wants to
put one foot into the mouth of a crocodile,

00:36:01.159 --> 00:36:03.159
how can we save such people?

00:36:03.159 --> 00:36:09.819
Then it’s better that they should go to
the crocodile than to the boat.

00:36:09.819 --> 00:36:17.939
But those who try to sympathise and put another
foot in the crocodile, then they have to be

00:36:17.939 --> 00:36:24.939
in trouble.

00:36:24.939 --> 00:36:31.358
All these things not only hamper but are so
inauspicious and dangerous that you all have

00:36:31.358 --> 00:36:36.919
to be extremely careful about it.

00:36:36.919 --> 00:36:38.848
You need not tell people that, “You are
evil!

00:36:38.848 --> 00:36:42.698
You are bad!“, or anything – but just
“Get out of Sahaja Yoga!”

00:36:42.698 --> 00:36:43.758
Have nothing to do with them.

00:36:43.758 --> 00:36:45.169
You should say, “We are sorry.

00:36:45.169 --> 00:36:47.098
We can’t to anything about it.

00:36:47.098 --> 00:36:48.238
You do what you like.

00:36:48.238 --> 00:36:51.128
It’s not our responsibility.”

00:36:51.128 --> 00:36:57.429
And there you should not be meek, you should
not feel embarrassed or delicate about it.

00:36:57.429 --> 00:36:59.518
Tell them off, “Nothing doing.

00:36:59.518 --> 00:37:07.199
We cannot help you here, we are sorry, you
work it out yourself.”

00:37:07.199 --> 00:37:16.039
Because this light is a light which nourishes
you and strengthens you.

00:37:16.039 --> 00:37:21.939
The light of the Spirit must give you that
strength within you.

00:37:21.939 --> 00:37:24.909
You become a strong personality.

00:37:24.909 --> 00:37:34.768
You become a personality which can withstand
lots of things, even crucifixion, but it can

00:37:34.768 --> 00:37:36.858
also fight.

00:37:36.858 --> 00:37:43.959
It has all the qualities built within itself.

00:37:43.959 --> 00:37:47.138
Like a person who has a temper.

00:37:47.138 --> 00:37:48.138
No!

00:37:48.138 --> 00:37:50.628
It’s not a very good person to be, with
temper.

00:37:50.628 --> 00:37:54.238
It’s not good for a Sahaja Yogi to have
temper.

00:37:54.238 --> 00:38:00.559
But if somebody says something to you against
your Mother, you have to have temper.

00:38:00.559 --> 00:38:04.268
That’s the place we have to use temper.

00:38:04.268 --> 00:38:08.289
You can box that person, doesn’t matter.

00:38:08.289 --> 00:38:14.929
(Laughter) Ganesha will be just standing behind
you.

00:38:14.929 --> 00:38:21.109
(Laughter) And Hanumana will be in front.

00:38:21.109 --> 00:38:27.498
(Laughter) If you box him once, Hanumana will
box him ten times.

00:38:27.498 --> 00:38:34.888
(Laughter) So that time the anger has meaning.

00:38:34.888 --> 00:38:44.858
Now, people say, one should not have greed
in life.

00:38:44.858 --> 00:38:51.738
Yes, one should not have greed, but if you
have got greed for vibrations it’s a very

00:38:51.738 --> 00:38:53.399
good thing.

00:38:53.399 --> 00:38:56.258
You should be very greedy about vibrations.

00:38:56.258 --> 00:39:02.108
Wherever you get vibrations, you must rush
and try to get more vibrations.

00:39:02.108 --> 00:39:08.959
Greed is alright, you should have that greed
within yourself.

00:39:08.959 --> 00:39:16.638
If you don’t have that greed, how will you
be able to overcome the other attractions?

00:39:16.638 --> 00:39:20.838
It is very surprising, I always wonder about
human beings – which I’ve never been able

00:39:20.838 --> 00:39:23.689
to understand Myself.

00:39:23.689 --> 00:39:35.039
(Laughter) That, when it comes to hatred they
are the best!

00:39:35.039 --> 00:39:43.799
If they want to hate someone then you can
make them sacrifice everything that they have.

00:39:43.799 --> 00:39:49.799
Under the name of God, under the name of nation,
under the name of anything whatever you want.

00:39:49.799 --> 00:39:52.979
You just have to say that, “We have to hate
someone.”

00:39:52.979 --> 00:39:59.809
Immediately they’ll gather around, they’ll
pass trough all kinds of ordeals, sacrifice

00:39:59.809 --> 00:40:08.878
everything, go to jails, they will kill themselves,
commit suicides – just if you tell them,

00:40:08.878 --> 00:40:11.478
“We hate someone.”

00:40:11.478 --> 00:40:18.238
Or else you have to say that, “We are a
great nation, something very big and, these

00:40:18.238 --> 00:40:23.659
are bad nations – so we have to fight.”

00:40:23.659 --> 00:40:29.458
They will do.

00:40:29.458 --> 00:40:37.228
It is very surprising that, even when it comes
to political revolutions and for their political

00:40:37.228 --> 00:40:44.838
freedom, they can go to any limit of sacrifices.

00:40:44.838 --> 00:40:47.128
The other day I was watching Lenin’s fight.

00:40:47.128 --> 00:40:48.419
I was amazed!

00:40:48.419 --> 00:40:56.458
This single man Lenin, who was always in the
exile used to only write, “We have to fight,

00:40:56.458 --> 00:40:58.809
we have to get this, we have to do that.”

00:40:58.809 --> 00:41:05.638
Though he was a realised soul, but still he
didn’t write about spirituality, he wrote

00:41:05.638 --> 00:41:12.748
about political struggle, and three times
there was an upsurge and thousands and thousands

00:41:12.748 --> 00:41:22.919
of people you find in every place being killed
– just like that.

00:41:22.919 --> 00:41:23.919
It is very surprising.

00:41:23.919 --> 00:41:31.969
Now, don’t fan, you see, while I am talking
you should not fan, you know, it disturbs.

00:41:31.969 --> 00:41:36.899
Pay full attention; pay full attention, is
important.

00:41:36.899 --> 00:41:43.649
Because if you do not pay attention, others
will look at you, and their attention will

00:41:43.649 --> 00:41:44.649
be spoiled.

00:41:44.649 --> 00:41:52.429
Now this one was so dedicated, even little
children and wives and pregnant women and

00:41:52.429 --> 00:41:57.478
so many men were killed in a lot like that.

00:41:57.478 --> 00:42:03.268
Again they rose, again they rose three times,
and the fourth time they were successful.

00:42:03.268 --> 00:42:06.199
For what?

00:42:06.199 --> 00:42:10.008
For a political achievement.

00:42:10.008 --> 00:42:14.758
We did that in India, too.

00:42:14.758 --> 00:42:19.789
People gave up everything that they have,
their houses, families – everything they

00:42:19.789 --> 00:42:21.789
gave up.

00:42:21.789 --> 00:42:28.378
Even for fake gurus people have spent so much
money, they have done so much, given up everything,

00:42:28.378 --> 00:42:32.899
sold their houses, put their children into
trouble, got into trouble – everything they

00:42:32.899 --> 00:42:34.029
did.

00:42:34.029 --> 00:42:51.709
But for the right thing, the wisest thing,
the only great thing that has to happen is

00:42:51.709 --> 00:42:58.828
Sahaja Yoga – where comfort is pouring on
us all the time, where all kinds of joy is

00:42:58.828 --> 00:43:10.279
pouring on us, where everything is being smoothed
out for you – people become so fond of comfort,

00:43:10.279 --> 00:43:18.448
and this and that, that the slightest sacrifice
they can’t understand.

00:43:18.448 --> 00:43:23.538
They’ll come with problems about their wives,
about their children, about their husbands

00:43:23.538 --> 00:43:24.738
– everything solved.

00:43:24.738 --> 00:43:28.059
Now this goes on and on and on and on.

00:43:28.059 --> 00:43:29.299
Solve them!

00:43:29.299 --> 00:43:30.388
Finish them off!

00:43:30.388 --> 00:43:32.438
Cut them short!

00:43:32.438 --> 00:43:36.649
You have to spread Sahaja Yoga!

00:43:36.649 --> 00:43:42.068
You have to sacrifice some time, you have
to sacrifice some money also.

00:43:42.068 --> 00:43:47.138
Who is going to work it out?

00:43:47.138 --> 00:43:56.229
Nobody is going to kill you, as people were
killed in Russia, or in Germany, or in Poland.

00:43:56.229 --> 00:44:00.948
Nobody is going to take away your children
or to take away your money, or anything – no

00:44:00.948 --> 00:44:05.029
one wants it.

00:44:05.029 --> 00:44:12.969
But this light in your hand has to be burnt
with the true desire, the pure desire within

00:44:12.969 --> 00:44:16.799
you, is the Kundalini.

00:44:16.799 --> 00:44:24.988
That is the wick, that is the one has to be
kept absolutely nourished.

00:44:24.988 --> 00:44:28.649
And that is where sahaja yogis fail.

00:44:28.649 --> 00:44:31.488
People don’t want to leave Sahaja Yoga.

00:44:31.488 --> 00:44:33.908
Even if you tell them, “Please go away,
we can’t help!”

00:44:33.908 --> 00:44:35.668
– “No, no, no, I cannot leave Sahaja Yoga.”

00:44:35.668 --> 00:44:36.668
– “Why?”

00:44:36.668 --> 00:44:37.758
Because is a place of enjoyment.

00:44:37.758 --> 00:44:47.338
But it would be something different from human
beings, because human beings, if a human being

00:44:47.338 --> 00:44:55.409
gets a bottle of wine he’ll call ten more
to enjoy it.

00:44:55.409 --> 00:45:02.409
If a dog gets something to eat he’ll call
other dogs to eat it.

00:45:02.409 --> 00:45:07.029
If a crow gets something to eat he’ll call
other crows to eat it.

00:45:07.029 --> 00:45:09.618
Naturally built within them.

00:45:09.618 --> 00:45:12.218
Same with human beings.

00:45:12.218 --> 00:45:18.998
But when it comes to Sahaja Yoga we are not
that tenacious about it.

00:45:18.998 --> 00:45:23.688
We have to tell all our relations, “We are
Sahaja Yogis, and this is the religion of

00:45:23.688 --> 00:45:28.198
within, and this is what it is – if you
don’t want to follow I have nothing to do

00:45:28.198 --> 00:45:29.198
with you.

00:45:29.198 --> 00:45:30.848
Why don’t you follow it?”

00:45:30.848 --> 00:45:32.508
Everybody has got relations.

00:45:32.508 --> 00:45:41.549
So on a Diwali day, when we were talking about
our light, what are we going to do with this

00:45:41.549 --> 00:45:42.549
light?

00:45:42.549 --> 00:45:45.638
Are we going to use it only for our own purpose?

00:45:45.638 --> 00:45:57.208
Christ has said, you don’t put the light
under a – what you call it? – measure.

00:45:57.208 --> 00:46:02.338
You don’t put it under a measure.

00:46:02.338 --> 00:46:05.348
You put it on a table.

00:46:05.348 --> 00:46:08.909
We all have to come out in the public, we
have to find out ways and methods.

00:46:08.909 --> 00:46:14.969
It’s not only the leaders, everybody has
to work it out what we can do to spread Sahaja

00:46:14.969 --> 00:46:15.969
Yoga.

00:46:15.969 --> 00:46:19.899
In every place you go: how can we give Sahaja
Yoga?

00:46:19.899 --> 00:46:25.169
Of course I don’t want you to change your
dresses – but you can carry big badges.

00:46:25.169 --> 00:46:26.169
People will ask you.

00:46:26.169 --> 00:46:33.179
You should say, “Yes, this is the person
who has given us peace, joy and happiness.”

00:46:33.179 --> 00:46:38.118
Start talking like that, go to the markets,
go to public places.

00:46:38.118 --> 00:46:47.419
I go to market just to spread vibrations – you
all have to do that, otherwise you will have

00:46:47.419 --> 00:46:52.118
the Sahaja Yoga enjoyment to yourself , but
unless and until you share it you are not

00:46:52.118 --> 00:46:53.888
going to enjoy it fully.

00:46:53.888 --> 00:46:55.618
Look at Me.

00:46:55.618 --> 00:47:00.049
I have all the vibrations of the world.

00:47:00.049 --> 00:47:08.509
(Laughter) I have everything, I should be
such a self-contented person, sitting at home

00:47:08.509 --> 00:47:13.149
– in meditation.

00:47:13.149 --> 00:47:18.859
(Laughter) At this age, why should I travel
after all?

00:47:18.859 --> 00:47:25.969
(Laughter) I am the Adi Shakti – why should
I worry of making everybody such a powerful

00:47:25.969 --> 00:47:27.888
shakti people?

00:47:27.888 --> 00:47:31.399
There’s no need.

00:47:31.399 --> 00:47:41.211
I should enjoy My powers, I can, but I cannot.

00:47:41.211 --> 00:47:43.169
I have to work hard.

00:47:43.169 --> 00:47:47.679
I give the maximum time to Sahaja Yoga, than
any one of you can give.

00:47:47.679 --> 00:47:52.619
I have a family, I have got My husband.

00:47:52.619 --> 00:47:55.319
He has a life which is very, very busy life.

00:47:55.319 --> 00:47:57.009
I’ve got grandchildren.

00:47:57.009 --> 00:47:59.449
I give the maximum time.

00:47:59.449 --> 00:48:04.029
Now see, from here to Rome, then to France,
then to Spain.

00:48:04.029 --> 00:48:07.459
You all are having just a relay race.

00:48:07.459 --> 00:48:11.889
Alright, I am here – Italians are having
a little strain.

00:48:11.889 --> 00:48:15.389
Then they will relax!

00:48:15.389 --> 00:48:18.429
“Now alright…”

00:48:18.429 --> 00:48:23.189
(Laughter) Then, what do I do?

00:48:23.189 --> 00:48:27.619
All the year round I am going from places
to places…travelling.

00:48:27.619 --> 00:48:32.659
And when I have everything.

00:48:32.659 --> 00:48:43.989
Can you think of a rich man who is busy distributing
all the wealth he has, while the others take

00:48:43.989 --> 00:48:46.389
time to take it?

00:48:46.389 --> 00:48:49.199
That is what it is.

00:48:49.199 --> 00:48:58.119
So I have to tell you that you have to come
in a new dimension of your enthusiasm.

00:48:58.119 --> 00:49:02.389
Sahaja Yoga is not for our enjoyment alone.

00:49:02.389 --> 00:49:04.129
“We are saints,” so what!

00:49:04.129 --> 00:49:05.219
For what?

00:49:05.219 --> 00:49:07.509
For what you are made saints?

00:49:07.509 --> 00:49:11.959
It’s not that the men should only do, or
women should do, or this one should do, or

00:49:11.959 --> 00:49:13.799
that one should do.

00:49:13.799 --> 00:49:20.209
Don’t get involved into these temptations.

00:49:20.209 --> 00:49:26.839
There are thirteen temptations, which came
out of the churning.

00:49:26.839 --> 00:49:35.419
The fourteenth one was a big hunter to neutralise
all the thirteen.

00:49:35.419 --> 00:49:43.739
Not that Sahaja Yoga wants to tempt anyone,
but they become temptations because they are

00:49:43.739 --> 00:49:48.269
blessings to you, and blessings you start
using as temptations.

00:49:48.269 --> 00:50:01.079
Now, for anybody, to have such a temptation
would be more like a horse, which has to go

00:50:01.079 --> 00:50:08.959
to the south or to the north, is standing
and eating the grass.

00:50:08.959 --> 00:50:15.489
You have to move, movement is the point, you
have to move from places to places, you have

00:50:15.489 --> 00:50:20.029
to go from villages to villages, you have
to go from houses to houses.

00:50:20.029 --> 00:50:22.709
This message has to spread.

00:50:22.709 --> 00:50:28.159
Christ’s twelve disciples only – how much
religion they have created?

00:50:28.159 --> 00:50:33.669
Of course, it’s of no use, but still!

00:50:33.669 --> 00:50:37.039
You are going to give something so substantial
and so great.

00:50:37.039 --> 00:50:40.269
But when you tell them, then the way you tell
them is important.

00:50:40.269 --> 00:50:46.979
The way you assert is important.

00:50:46.979 --> 00:50:51.079
I don’t mind from today – you can tell
them what I am.

00:50:51.079 --> 00:50:52.319
Doesn’t matter.

00:50:52.319 --> 00:50:53.889
How long are we going to hide it?

00:50:53.889 --> 00:50:58.619
You better tell them that, “She is such
and such, it’s written in the Bible, She

00:50:58.619 --> 00:51:00.209
is such and such – we have found it.

00:51:00.209 --> 00:51:03.419
If you don’t want to see it, don’t see
it – but it is so.”

00:51:03.419 --> 00:51:13.999
Let’s have that determination and let’s
have that kind of a outspokenness.

00:51:13.999 --> 00:51:16.339
Look at these horrible politicians.

00:51:16.339 --> 00:51:22.769
They say, “I believe that there should be
some people who should be rich, the rest should

00:51:22.769 --> 00:51:23.769
be poor.

00:51:23.769 --> 00:51:25.469
I believe.

00:51:25.469 --> 00:51:27.969
I believe in this and I believe in that.”

00:51:27.969 --> 00:51:29.509
What about you?

00:51:29.509 --> 00:51:33.879
You do not only believe, but you know for
definite!

00:51:33.879 --> 00:51:45.039
And that’s what should be decided on a Diwali
day that by next Diwali we have to get many,

00:51:45.039 --> 00:51:46.669
many people for Sahaja Yoga.

00:51:46.669 --> 00:51:52.109
But when I speak, many people told Me that
they think I am not speaking to them [but]

00:51:52.109 --> 00:51:54.919
to somebody else.

00:51:54.919 --> 00:52:00.039
You should see to the people who are working
harder than you for Sahaja Yoga; who are involved

00:52:00.039 --> 00:52:04.949
more in Sahaja Yoga; those who are achieving
more in Sahaja Yoga – not the people who

00:52:04.949 --> 00:52:07.339
have done nothing.

00:52:07.339 --> 00:52:10.699
You can see Me.

00:52:10.699 --> 00:52:17.019
What are we doing?

00:52:17.019 --> 00:52:20.519
You should think about it.

00:52:20.519 --> 00:52:24.219
Where are we?

00:52:24.219 --> 00:52:28.249
This is the most important period.

00:52:28.249 --> 00:52:32.959
At the most, in Europe, I will be for five
years more, at the most.

00:52:32.959 --> 00:52:39.889
Do you think I’ll be travelling after seventy
years of age?

00:52:39.889 --> 00:52:42.929
No.

00:52:42.929 --> 00:52:48.209
So this is such an important time when I am
here, then I could meet people, I could talk

00:52:48.209 --> 00:52:51.019
to them, I can help you a lot.

00:52:51.019 --> 00:52:53.569
In these five years you have to achieve something.

00:52:53.569 --> 00:52:59.099
And you have to take a jump and give a speed
to yourself.

00:52:59.099 --> 00:53:05.699
Otherwise this is a very important time, will
be lost by all your fellow men.

00:53:05.699 --> 00:53:08.129
Like the other day we had program.

00:53:08.129 --> 00:53:12.999
I’ll tell you a practical side: now what,
I would do [is] take the addresses of all

00:53:12.999 --> 00:53:20.859
the people who got realisation, take it down,
write to them, go and see them, meet them.

00:53:20.859 --> 00:53:23.779
[Find out] what has happened, why didn’t
they come.

00:53:23.779 --> 00:53:30.539
Then make a statement, why people didn’t
come, what happened, why is he not coming.

00:53:30.539 --> 00:53:33.609
Write to them all the time.

00:53:33.609 --> 00:53:38.879
See you’ll be surprised if you take one
copy of ‘Reader’s Digest‘ (Magazine),

00:53:38.879 --> 00:53:41.959
only once – make a mistake.

00:53:41.959 --> 00:53:50.029
(Laughter) – they go on sending you so many
types of things, you know?

00:53:50.029 --> 00:53:56.039
(Laughter) You will get this present, you’ll
get – this is a car free for you, this thing

00:53:56.039 --> 00:53:57.039
for you.

00:53:57.039 --> 00:53:58.039
Who wants it?

00:53:58.039 --> 00:53:59.099
But they go on sending.

00:53:59.099 --> 00:54:01.609
I have written to them, “Don’t send Me
anything.

00:54:01.609 --> 00:54:02.609
I don’t want any car – nothing.

00:54:02.609 --> 00:54:06.309
You just send Me Reader’s Digest, thank
you very much.

00:54:06.309 --> 00:54:09.289
I’m not a lucky person.

00:54:09.289 --> 00:54:11.669
Please don’t send.”

00:54:11.669 --> 00:54:14.849
Still they are sending!

00:54:14.849 --> 00:54:16.439
(Laughter & applause)

00:54:16.439 --> 00:54:20.329
In this way you must write to them all the
time, “Why are you not coming to Mother?

00:54:20.329 --> 00:54:22.389
Why you are not coming to Sahaja Yoga?

00:54:22.389 --> 00:54:26.189
Sahaja Yoga is so important, it has given
me so much, why don’t you want to have it?”

00:54:26.189 --> 00:54:30.049
You must show that earnestness within you.

00:54:30.049 --> 00:54:35.479
And if you do not show that earnestness – take
it in a mundane way, “Alright, it’s going

00:54:35.479 --> 00:54:39.209
well, this, that, is good, alright, this is
improving, that is.”

00:54:39.209 --> 00:54:42.319
That’s not the way you are going to work
it out!

00:54:42.319 --> 00:54:47.429
Once I go to India I know in India it will
take no time.

00:54:47.429 --> 00:54:51.659
India will work out very fast.

00:54:51.659 --> 00:55:00.609
And you have to book your seats in the heaven,
that’s very important.

00:55:00.609 --> 00:55:07.999
I mean, even for an aeroplane you have to
book a seat; then what about heaven?

00:55:07.999 --> 00:55:11.879
(Laughter) And so many have to book the seats.

00:55:11.879 --> 00:55:17.959
If all Indians are sitting there, what will
you do?

00:55:17.959 --> 00:55:21.869
(Laughter)

00:55:21.869 --> 00:55:30.499
So with this joy, with this happiness, with
this light on our face, with this beauty of

00:55:30.499 --> 00:55:34.489
enlightenment you are all gurus.

00:55:34.489 --> 00:55:38.479
Imagine, these useless [false] gurus know
nothing, their Kundalini is not awakened,

00:55:38.479 --> 00:55:42.269
nothing of that kind – and how much they
have built up their empires after empires.

00:55:42.269 --> 00:55:49.209
I don’t say that you build up empires, no,
not that way, but why not build up at least

00:55:49.209 --> 00:55:57.279
a hut to show that you have achieved something
and it has to be done.

00:55:57.279 --> 00:56:01.479
Talk to everyone in your office, in your this
thing, not to feel shy.

00:56:01.479 --> 00:56:05.729
I have seen people put up these horrible peoples’
photographs everywhere.

00:56:05.729 --> 00:56:10.419
In their office you go, you find them; in
the buses you find them; everywhere they are

00:56:10.419 --> 00:56:11.419
hanging.

00:56:11.419 --> 00:56:13.939
Why not My photograph?

00:56:13.939 --> 00:56:19.329
So the curiosity is there, people will ask
you, you tell them – it will work out.

00:56:19.329 --> 00:56:22.499
The best thing is working out in Italy, surprisingly.

00:56:22.499 --> 00:56:27.719
And it will go ahead, because we found some
very good people and you should try to find

00:56:27.719 --> 00:56:30.039
out.

00:56:30.039 --> 00:56:34.029
Such people who are around – get after them
and work it out.

00:56:34.029 --> 00:56:38.149
But don’t go to wrong people, must use your
discretion.

00:56:38.149 --> 00:56:43.049
You know how these [false] gurus work – is
very important.

00:56:43.049 --> 00:56:48.379
My brother was telling Me that a lady from
this Muktananda – now the Muktananda is

00:56:48.379 --> 00:56:53.249
not there, there is another American girl,
American-styled Indian girl.

00:56:53.249 --> 00:57:00.749
So, this Muktananda lady (disciple), one English
lady came to his house, My brother’s house

00:57:00.749 --> 00:57:04.199
– and she was very sweet, “I want to see
you, Sir,” – this, that.

00:57:04.199 --> 00:57:05.669
And she saw My photograph.

00:57:05.669 --> 00:57:08.069
So she said, “What is this Mataji doing
here?”

00:57:08.069 --> 00:57:09.069
He said, “Why?

00:57:09.069 --> 00:57:10.759
She is my sister.”

00:57:10.759 --> 00:57:15.119
She just bundled up everything and ran away.

00:57:15.119 --> 00:57:18.269
So My brother called her, “Please, come
along, sit down, sit down.

00:57:18.269 --> 00:57:19.269
What do you do?”

00:57:19.269 --> 00:57:24.399
She said, “No Sir, we see – we always
go and meet all the important people of the

00:57:24.399 --> 00:57:27.209
city, talk to them about it.”

00:57:27.209 --> 00:57:29.739
He said, “Yes.”

00:57:29.739 --> 00:57:33.069
And all the judges’ names were on the list.

00:57:33.069 --> 00:57:36.199
Immediately My brother took the telephone
and told them, “Have nothing to do with

00:57:36.199 --> 00:57:38.559
this woman!”

00:57:38.559 --> 00:57:42.289
But this is what it is.

00:57:42.289 --> 00:57:44.619
You should find out how to approach people.

00:57:44.619 --> 00:57:48.459
When I am there, there are – say – 200
people.

00:57:48.459 --> 00:57:50.199
When I go away, there are only 2 people.

00:57:50.199 --> 00:57:51.199
Why?

00:57:51.199 --> 00:57:52.199
What is the matter?

00:57:52.199 --> 00:57:54.649
Why they go away?

00:57:54.649 --> 00:57:57.499
There must be some reason.

00:57:57.499 --> 00:58:00.729
They don’t know Me.

00:58:00.729 --> 00:58:03.179
At least get their addresses.

00:58:03.179 --> 00:58:04.979
Find out who are these people.

00:58:04.979 --> 00:58:10.769
There’s no harm in getting their addresses
and finding out who they are.

00:58:10.769 --> 00:58:17.849
Then put them on the list and go on sending
letters to them, if not so much like Reader’s

00:58:17.849 --> 00:58:22.169
Digest, but something.

00:58:22.169 --> 00:58:27.409
When you will start sending letters to them,
you will be entered into their ignorance.

00:58:27.409 --> 00:58:30.309
The light will go in.

00:58:30.309 --> 00:58:34.519
Through your movement, your attention, the
light will go.

00:58:34.519 --> 00:58:38.369
You don’t know your attention, how powerful
it is.

00:58:38.369 --> 00:58:42.059
Once you start paying attention to them, the
light will pass through them.

00:58:42.059 --> 00:58:46.229
If not today, tomorrow they’ll come round.

00:58:46.229 --> 00:58:51.009
You can also send My photograph, “Try on
the photograph, this is the photograph, you

00:58:51.009 --> 00:58:53.119
came to the program, we are very happy.”

00:58:53.119 --> 00:58:58.609
Now if the follow-on doesn’t work out, try
this thing.

00:58:58.609 --> 00:59:05.609
And that’s the best way you can achieve
sometimes, but it is for you to think and

00:59:05.609 --> 00:59:09.829
understand – because you are human beings
and you know human beings.

00:59:09.829 --> 00:59:16.369
You just put yourself in the position of another
person – what would have appealed to you?

00:59:16.369 --> 00:59:26.339
There’s another thing I feel that people
should write books about Me.

00:59:26.339 --> 00:59:27.339
There’s no harm.

00:59:27.339 --> 00:59:31.469
But about Me, write the book about Me.

00:59:31.469 --> 00:59:36.749
But some people, who have a name, who have
in the society some name, who will be taken

00:59:36.749 --> 00:59:42.689
up seriously – they can write a book about
Me.

00:59:42.689 --> 00:59:46.899
They write books about everyone, why can’t
you write a book about Me?

00:59:46.899 --> 00:59:51.349
Not about, you can write about Sahaja Yoga
in it – of course, but you can write about

00:59:51.349 --> 00:59:52.349
Me.

00:59:52.349 --> 00:59:56.949
Telling people of such and such person is
there, and this is the solution, this is the

00:59:56.949 --> 00:59:57.949
hope.

00:59:57.949 --> 00:59:58.949
Why not?

00:59:58.949 --> 01:00:02.739
They write about all these horrible gurus,
why can’t you write about Me?

01:00:02.739 --> 01:00:07.359
But the person has to be a well known person.

01:00:07.359 --> 01:00:15.709
Now supposing you write a book, somebody else
can publish in his name – if you are a good

01:00:15.709 --> 01:00:16.709
writer.

01:00:16.709 --> 01:00:18.999
Somebody else can edit it and publish it.

01:00:18.999 --> 01:00:20.899
We can do that way.

01:00:20.899 --> 01:00:26.899
There are so many ways and methods by which
you can bring to the notice of the people

01:00:26.899 --> 01:00:28.379
that this is Sahaja Yoga.

01:00:28.379 --> 01:00:31.469
How many people know about Sahaja Yoga?

01:00:31.469 --> 01:00:36.369
A person comes out of jail, from India, walks
out and here it is.

01:00:36.369 --> 01:00:46.109
Very well known ‘guru’ sitting in some
corner of some dirty lane in America somewhere,

01:00:46.109 --> 01:00:47.509
and is a very well known person.

01:00:47.509 --> 01:00:59.639
They are all very well known – how?

01:00:59.639 --> 01:01:04.889
And it is not always that these things are
done through money, they are done through

01:01:04.889 --> 01:01:10.199
people doing their own deliberation.

01:01:10.199 --> 01:01:15.119
But these deliberations may be mesmerising,
bhootish, I agree.

01:01:15.119 --> 01:01:20.089
I do understand that you are free people,
to do what you like, but in your freedom you

01:01:20.089 --> 01:01:22.269
have to realise.

01:01:22.269 --> 01:01:27.079
And this is what today you all have to decide
that this is the light we have got, this has

01:01:27.079 --> 01:01:34.519
to be made into a beacon, not just a light,
a tinted light like that; what’s the use?

01:01:34.519 --> 01:01:38.529
We have to be like a beautiful tower of light.

01:01:38.529 --> 01:01:43.879
Like a lighthouse.

01:01:43.879 --> 01:01:47.759
And everybody should work it out within and
without.

01:01:47.759 --> 01:01:50.659
Within though you have worked out, without
you must work now.

01:01:50.659 --> 01:01:55.219
And secondly there’s a deepawali, it is
not only one light.

01:01:55.219 --> 01:01:58.829
So we have to be all collective, try to get
to collective life.

01:01:58.829 --> 01:02:03.989
Whenever it is possible, try to attend all
that is collective; try to be there, where

01:02:03.989 --> 01:02:05.189
there is collective happenings.

01:02:05.189 --> 01:02:10.959
There, where it is collective, this source
of energy flows better.

01:02:10.959 --> 01:02:15.299
May God bless you all!
