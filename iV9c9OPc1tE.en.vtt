00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.240
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:39.080
At the very outset you have to know that truth is what it is.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.080
We cannot change it.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.360
We cannot transform it

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.760
and we cannot conceptualize it.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:56.240
Also unfortunately at this human awareness

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.040
we cannot feel the truth,

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.680
so something has to be done,

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.960
something has to work out in our human awareness

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.120
in the evolutionary process.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.680
We have become human beings from amoeba.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.560
How did we become?

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.120
And if we are human beings

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.440
have we reached the Absolute State? We have not.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.640
If we had reached the absolute state

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.320
then there would have been no problems

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.560
because everybody would have seen the same thing,

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.640
would have understood the same thing

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.360
and felt the same thing

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.280
but because we are living in a relative world

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.000
we have all these problems.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.480
As it is, most of the problems are created

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.360
by human beings.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.840
If you see ecological problems,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.640
if you see economic problems, political problems,

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.560
physical problems,

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.240
mental problems, family problems,

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.880
all of them are related to human beings.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.960
So we have gone wrong somewhere,

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.320
there’s something that’s a missing point

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.200
which we have not realized.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.880
The advancements we have made in our civilization,

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.800
say in science,

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.480
has reached such a stage that we had to create atom bomb,

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.560
hydrogen bomb.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.200
So all these mental efforts we have put in also boomerang on us

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.080
and create our destruction.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.960
In every way we get frustrated,

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.680
and we start seeking what’s the matter?

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.840
Then we turn to religion

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.240
and we find in religion also

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.200
it just words, words and words.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.040
Whatever is written in the Bible,

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.840
same about written in Koran if you read it, or Dhammapada

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.160
or Gita everywhere is about just the same,

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.320
there’s not much of a change.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.960
But still we may follow any religion,

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.160
so-called following I would say.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:57.480
Still a human being belonging to any religion can commit any sin,

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.360
any sin.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.440
There’s no binding force on him of that religion.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.680
Why is it all these great religions,

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.240
which were created by great incarnations

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.680
and great prophets

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.760
have taken such a deviated path,

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.320
and why we have not been able to achieve

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.080
whatever they have promised to us?

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.880
What is the reason why we could not achieve that?

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.360
What has gone wrong?

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.080
If you read Koran you will be amazed,

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.720
the description of what was the vision of Mohammad Sahib

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.040
is far away from the Muslims as they are.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.600
Same about Christians you can say.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:02.040
When Christ has said “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes.”

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:07.360
Difficult to find Christians who don’t have.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.400
In this way we have to realize on one side

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.840
whatever mental efforts we are putting,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.080
or on the other side whatever

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.360
physical or emotional efforts we are putting,

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.480
have come back to us,

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.480
destroying us.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.880
We can see the result very clearly

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.400
why all these problems are there.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.960
Still we adhere to something which is not reality.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.320
We go on clinging to it

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.320
because perhaps we are born like that.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.680
Perhaps we think that that’s we have done now all our lives

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.440
so why give up.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.480
And the forefathers have done the same,

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.440
you are doing the same.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.080
But now a new category of very honest people are there

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.560
in this world who are seeking beyond.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.480
William Blake has called them men of God,

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:21.680
those who will seek the truth

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.600
and they will make other people also godly.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.440
That’s the time has come, this resurrection time has come we should say

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.040
or this is the Last Judgment.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.160
This Last Judgment is going to be done

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.520
by this Kundalini, the power within you.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.960
This is your own power

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.520
which has to be awakened

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.040
and once it is awakened it passes through these centers as told to you

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.760
and lets you know that these are your problems.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.800
These are the problems of your chakras.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.480
They may be physical, may be emotional,

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:05.560
they may be, could be also spiritual.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.440
And once you know these problems

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.720
and if you know how to solve these problems

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:18.480
you can be a very normal, sensible, balanced personality.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.960
That’s not the only thing that happens

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.520
when you get your self realization.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.400
Firstly what happens to you is that

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.960
when the Kundalini passes through your Agyna chakra

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:37.320
then you become thoughtlessly aware.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:44.160
If you see all the sciences they have created about religion,

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:49.080
talks and the whole thing, it’s just mental.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:55.960
It’s not inside, it’s not innate, built within.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:59.000
So one thought rises, another thought falls.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.160
Another thought rises and falls down,

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:06.040
some come from the future, some come from the past,

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:10.800
and we are jumping on the cusp of these thoughts.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:14.720
But if you say now, this is the present,

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.840
stop your mind at the stop point

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.640
which is the present, you can’t,

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.760
you just can’t do it.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:26.960
Between these thoughts there is a gap.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:31.520
This gap is the present, but it’s so small, it’s so small

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.120
that you cannot find it.

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:38.680
But when the Kundalini passes through,

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.920
then this center, then these two institutions as you see them,

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:46.880
the conditioning and the ego are just sucked in.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:50.720
As a result you become thoughtlessly aware.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.560
Means there is no thought.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.680
But you are absolutely aware, very much more aware.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:59.040
For example if you look at this beautiful hall

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:03.960
with the thoughtless awareness,

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:07.520
then the whole picture becomes clear

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:11.160
like a photo in your mind,

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:18.040
whole thing is stored up into every detail so clearly

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.560
because present is the truth,

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.240
past is finished and future doesn’t exist.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.520
So to come to the present you have to have

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:31.800
this new awareness called as thoughtless awareness.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.440
But when She crosses over

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.400
and pierces through your fontanel bone area

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:43.040
which is the actualization of your baptism.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.960
Just people talk of baptism, “Come along I’ll baptize you”.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.560
It’s not possible that way.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.080
It’s just an artificial ritual.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.080
Try to understand, this is not going to render

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.640
that actual happening within you

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.640
which is going to make you grow spiritually.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.320
So the actualization of baptism takes place

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:07.120
and you can feel also from your fontanel bone area

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:12.520
a kind of a cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming in.

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.200
You feel extremely relaxed.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:21.560
Secondly that you jump into another higher awareness

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:25.480
which we call, as collective consciousness.

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.440
This means that

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.200
not only that you can you feel your own centers on your fingertips,

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:37.280
because these cool vibrations you can call

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.840
them start flowing through your own hands,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.200
you can feel them.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:46.240
But also you get information about others

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:50.360
as well as about yourself on these fingertips.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:57.920
Automatically you become like a person who is a computer.

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.800
It starts working in such a wonderful manner

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.200
that you can find out about any disease,

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:08.720
any trouble without going through all the diagnosis or anything,

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:12.640
and if you know how to cure these troubles, physically, mentally,

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:16.680
you can definitely cure yourself and also others

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.520
if you have reached that state

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:23.400
and have permanently achieved it.

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.240
This is what has to happen to us.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.680
All of us have to achieve that state

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:35.120
which is your right to achieve it.

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:38.880
Sahaja means with you is born.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.160
This yoga means the union.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:47.400
The union with this All Pervading Power of God’s love.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:53.360
It exists or not, we have never bothered to find out.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:56.280
We see these beautiful flowers,

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:59.320
very beautiful flowers and everything around.

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.840
When I came from Sydney I saw the beauty,

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:06.480
the nature had just spread for the pleasure of human beings,

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.960
we never even think how it has happened,

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.560
what has worked it out, all these living things.

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:15.880
We don’t even think how this eye of ours

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:21.080
is such a beautiful camera, how it has been made,

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:25.080
how is it this brain which is such a great computer,

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:29.840
how is it made. Who has made it?

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.360
They may say it is autonomous but who is this auto?

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.040
We have never tried to find out.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:38.480
That there is this All Pervading Power of God’s love

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.840
which has done all this living work

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
and now for us it is to feel that,

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.840
that is the yoga is, the union with that Divine.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.520
It’s not physical, it’s not mental,

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.800
but it is spiritual where

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:57.280
you start first time feeling this All Pervading Power.

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.320
Then only you have to know how to use this power

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:04.200
which flows through you.

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:08.920
But it moves very slowly and people,

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.280
you see this is not a plastic work

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.200
that you can go on producing many

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.640
and we don’t have any organization as such,

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.680
we do not organize people

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:21.360
and we do not take any money at all, you cannot.

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:24.520
How much can you pay for this Divine Work?

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:27.720
How much do we pay to Mother Earth for what she gives us

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.800
all these beautiful flowers?

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:33.280
She doesn’t understand money, so you cannot pay for it.

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:36.440
But there are many, many organizations afloat,

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:40.080
which are taking money, which are giving you mental heat

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.720
and people run after them,

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:45.280
they like to go on working out that yarn

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:49.080
that they have spun for you.

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:55.000
One has to go beyond this mind to feel the spirituality.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.760
With this mind, that is human mind, you cannot understand it,

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.960
you have to have Divine mind.

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.080
But once you get your realization

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.680
your mind also gets enlightened,

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:10.160
and when your mind is enlightened, you can perceive,

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:13.960
penetrate into every situation

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:20.440
in such a deeper manner and the way you can improve it.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:23.800
I can tell you a simple analogy to understand.

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:31.760
Supposing you are standing in the sea and the sea is rough,

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:35.040
you are afraid of the waves, very much afraid.

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.680
But supposing somebody puts you on the boat,

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:42.800
and then you can see those waves and enjoy them.

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.280
But supposing you learn how to swim

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:48.080
then you can jump in and save them.

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.360
It is not any brainwashing

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:54.840
or any sort of a bombardment of words,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.760
but it is something that happens to you.

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:01.360
You become something as you have become human beings,

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.640
you become realized souls

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:09.640
as a result of this last breakthrough of your evolution.

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.560
This is happening everywhere no doubt

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.440
and it’s working out very well in,

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:18.840
I think they told me, 62 countries

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.280
but at least I know of definitely of 52 countries

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:24.880
where there We have got very strong centers

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.760
where it is working out.

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.920
Now whatever we are telling you here

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.400
you need not accept blindfolded.

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:35.400
Blind faith is of no use.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.680
First of all you must experience.

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:42.400
Just like a hypothesis I am putting this before you,

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:45.680
but you should have an open mind of a scientist.

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:49.400
Just open your mind and see for yourself it works.

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:52.280
If it works then you have to accept.

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:54.480
If you are honest you have to accept.

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:57.240
If it doesn’t work. If it works with many,

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.760
why not try and work it out.

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:03.080
Most of the people do get their realization. I have seen it.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:05.040
It’s a wonderful thing that is happening

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:08.200
that masses of people can get realization.

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:12.480
Depends on also certain places like Russia I was amazed.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.360
Where they have not heard the name of God

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:15.920
they have never heard the name of Christ.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:18.960
They were not allowed to read Bible or any book,

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.800
they had no religion at all.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.680
They believed in no religion.

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:27.320
Where thousands and thousands come to My program

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:30.200
and they all get their realization.

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:32.840
In a small place called Togliati

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.640
there are 22 thousand Sahaja Yogis practicing Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.560
Can you imagine it? I was so amazed.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:46.000
Same about Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Poland.

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:49.320
I was amazed how these people, Czechoslovakia,

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:52.160
how they have taken to Sahaja Yoga so fast,

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:55.680
just like fish to water,

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:58.400
how they realized it, and nobody else,

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.320
all these false people, could not go there,

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:03.160
nothing could work out.

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:05.600
Only thing that has really worked out there

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:10.200
is something that is genuine. That is Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:15.360
One has to realize that as we are not in the Absolute State,

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:18.080
we have to reach to the Absolute State.

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:21.440
That desire should be there.

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:23.840
If that desire is there it works out

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.840
without any difficulty.

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.320
It is your own power which manifests

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:31.400
and gradually you can manifest them in such a way

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:36.480
that you can do so many things like giving realization to others,

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:43.200
curing others and also enjoying it,

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:49.320
because when the attention is filled with the light of the Spirit,

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:53.600
it fills you up with complete joy,

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:58.600
and joy has not two sides like happiness and unhappiness.

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:04.200
It’s singular, it’s absolute and you are then,

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:11.760
they say they are swimming in the ocean of joy.

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:13.600
So beautiful it is.

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:21.280
This new race, we can call it.

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:24.720
The new society, is already formed.

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:28.640
It’s there, they’re angel-like people, beautiful.

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.720
I never tell them, don’t drink, don’t smoke,

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:35.200
don’t take drugs, nothing of the kind. I don’t tell them,

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:37.760
it just automatically drops out

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.840
because in the light they see the ignorance that they had.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.440
They see the darkness and they just drop it.

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.280
We don’t have to tell them anything,

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:51.920
not to brainwash them or anything; it just works automatically.

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.520
You don’t have to follow any kind

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.760
of a fundamental groups or things, nothing of the kind.

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:02.880
You just know this is fundamental because you have got

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:05.880
the light within you, then they see the goodness,

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:08.440
then they see the oneness of all the religions.

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:11.040
So if you know the oneness of all the religions,

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:13.120
why will you be fundamentalist?

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:17.320
If you belong to one organization or to another church

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:20.200
or to another religion then you fight.

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:23.800
When you get into compartments like this, then only you fight.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:26.760
Everybody thinks we are the chosen ones,

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:30.240
that’s how we have this fundamentalism now,

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:34.200
knocking at our doors. So to get rid of it

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:36.200
the best thing is. First of all

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.680
you have to become a universal being,

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:41.720
and this Spirit is the Universal Being.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.680
Once you become the Universal Being

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:45.720
then you will be surprised to see it,

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:50.120
that all these differences you saw because of complete ignorance.

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:52.760
For example there is light you can see each other here,

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:56.560
but supposing there is complete pitch darkness,

00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:00.360
you don’t know who’s sitting here, who is right, who is left..

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:01.680
You don’t know how to walk.

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:04.960
You may trample over people, you may just get frightened,

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:07.480
you may run helter skelter.

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:10.520
But if there is light you see things so clearly.

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:13.680
In the same way Sahaja Yoga works first.

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:16.760
Some people get not all the light I should say,

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:20.440
but they do get a little light, a glimmer of light,

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.960
and then it starts expanding. And when it expands

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:26.880
you will be amazed how things work out.

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:29.960
Also I have seen people after coming to Sahaja Yoga,

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:33.640
they become extremely intelligent, absorbent,

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:37.160
and a kind of a very dynamic personality comes in them.

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:40.560
Now you have seen these Australians singing Sanskrit songs.

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:42.840
I mean imagine, Sanskrit,

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.920
even these English lived in India for 300 years,

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:48.640
they couldn’t learn one sentence of Hindi language,

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:52.960
leave alone Sanskrit, but the way they are singing with such

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:55.840
clarity, even the Indians are surprised

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.280
at how they are singing our songs in Sanskrit language.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.880
It is an impossibility,

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:04.520
you cannot think of a Western person singing like this

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:06.920
with all the rhythm and the melody and all that

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:10.520
and in no time they pick it up.

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:14.960
There are artists and artists who have now got world fame in India

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:18.440
after coming to Sahaja Yoga. We have got here also

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:23.480
some artists who were painters and have become very,

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:27.600
have got a good name for themselves. Everything changes.

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:31.440
You become on top of the world but you don’t become competitive,

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.800
you start enjoying each other.

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:37.840
Such a brotherhood, such love, such friendship,

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:44.120
that you become one drop becoming an ocean,

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:47.240
microcosm becoming the macrocosm.

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:51.440
We talk about these things but we have never achieved it.

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:56.080
Now the time has come for us to achieve all this.

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:59.280
In this one lecture I know I can’t talk much.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:01.800
Last year also I was here

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:05.280
and Lord Mayor was here also to grace the occasion.

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:08.240
I found him to be a remarkable person,

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:10.800
the way he got his realization.

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.120
You are especially blessed people I think,

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:17.000
Newcastle with this beautiful lake here

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:21.480
and beautiful surroundings, and I hope that

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:24.080
Sahaja Yoga will work out here very well.

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:27.560
Gradually it will take its roots,

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:31.760
and you can have a real good center in Newcastle.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.920
May God bless you all.
