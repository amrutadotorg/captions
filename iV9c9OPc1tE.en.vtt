WEBVTT

00:22.520 --> 00:27.240
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:29.320 --> 00:39.080
At the very outset you have to know that truth is what it is.

00:39.960 --> 00:43.080
We cannot change it.

00:43.440 --> 00:46.360
We cannot transform it

00:46.640 --> 00:49.760
and we cannot conceptualize it.

00:50.200 --> 00:56.240
Also unfortunately at this human awareness

00:56.960 --> 01:02.040
we cannot feel the truth,

01:08.600 --> 01:11.680
so something has to be done,

01:12.360 --> 01:17.960
something has to work out in our human awareness

01:19.000 --> 01:22.120
in the evolutionary process.

01:22.280 --> 01:27.680
We have become human beings from amoeba.

01:30.160 --> 01:33.560
How did we become?

01:34.480 --> 01:37.120
And if we are human beings

01:37.280 --> 01:42.440
have we reached the Absolute State? We have not.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.640
If we had reached the absolute state

01:46.880 --> 01:49.320
then there would have been no problems

01:49.480 --> 01:52.560
because everybody would have seen the same thing,

01:52.720 --> 01:54.640
would have understood the same thing

01:54.800 --> 01:57.360
and felt the same thing

01:57.520 --> 02:00.280
but because we are living in a relative world

02:00.440 --> 02:03.000
we have all these problems.

02:03.160 --> 02:08.480
As it is, most of the problems are created

02:08.640 --> 02:11.360
by human beings.

02:13.960 --> 02:16.840
If you see ecological problems,

02:17.000 --> 02:21.640
if you see economic problems, political problems,

02:21.800 --> 02:23.560
physical problems,

02:23.720 --> 02:28.240
mental problems, family problems,

02:28.400 --> 02:33.880
all of them are related to human beings.

02:34.040 --> 02:40.960
So we have gone wrong somewhere,

02:41.160 --> 02:43.320
there’s something that’s a missing point

02:43.480 --> 02:46.200
which we have not realized.

02:46.360 --> 02:52.880
The advancements we have made in our civilization,

02:53.040 --> 02:54.800
say in science,

02:54.960 --> 03:00.480
has reached such a stage that we had to create atom bomb,

03:00.640 --> 03:02.560
hydrogen bomb.

03:02.720 --> 03:08.200
So all these mental efforts we have put in also boomerang on us

03:08.360 --> 03:12.080
and create our destruction.

03:13.080 --> 03:17.960
In every way we get frustrated,

03:19.360 --> 03:22.680
and we start seeking what’s the matter?

03:22.840 --> 03:24.840
Then we turn to religion

03:25.000 --> 03:27.240
and we find in religion also

03:27.400 --> 03:30.200
it just words, words and words.

03:30.360 --> 03:32.040
Whatever is written in the Bible,

03:32.200 --> 03:35.840
same about written in Koran if you read it, or Dhammapada

03:35.960 --> 03:39.160
or Gita everywhere is about just the same,

03:39.320 --> 03:43.320
there’s not much of a change.

03:43.720 --> 03:47.960
But still we may follow any religion,

03:48.120 --> 03:51.160
so-called following I would say.

03:51.320 --> 03:57.480
Still a human being belonging to any religion can commit any sin,

03:57.640 --> 03:59.360
any sin.

03:59.520 --> 04:03.440
There’s no binding force on him of that religion.

04:03.600 --> 04:07.680
Why is it all these great religions,

04:07.840 --> 04:11.240
which were created by great incarnations

04:11.400 --> 04:16.680
and great prophets

04:16.840 --> 04:21.760
have taken such a deviated path,

04:21.920 --> 04:25.320
and why we have not been able to achieve

04:25.480 --> 04:29.080
whatever they have promised to us?

04:29.240 --> 04:34.880
What is the reason why we could not achieve that?

04:35.040 --> 04:38.360
What has gone wrong?

04:41.800 --> 04:45.080
If you read Koran you will be amazed,

04:45.240 --> 04:49.720
the description of what was the vision of Mohammad Sahib

04:49.880 --> 04:53.040
is far away from the Muslims as they are.

04:53.200 --> 04:55.600
Same about Christians you can say.

04:55.760 --> 05:02.040
When Christ has said “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes.”

05:02.200 --> 05:07.360
Difficult to find Christians who don’t have.

05:09.960 --> 05:13.400
In this way we have to realize on one side

05:13.600 --> 05:18.840
whatever mental efforts we are putting,

05:19.000 --> 05:23.080
or on the other side whatever

05:23.240 --> 05:27.360
physical or emotional efforts we are putting,

05:27.520 --> 05:31.480
have come back to us,

05:33.440 --> 05:36.480
destroying us.

05:36.640 --> 05:40.880
We can see the result very clearly

05:41.040 --> 05:44.400
why all these problems are there.

05:44.560 --> 05:49.960
Still we adhere to something which is not reality.

05:50.120 --> 05:52.320
We go on clinging to it

05:52.480 --> 05:55.320
because perhaps we are born like that.

05:55.480 --> 05:59.680
Perhaps we think that that’s we have done now all our lives

05:59.840 --> 06:01.440
so why give up.

06:01.600 --> 06:03.480
And the forefathers have done the same,

06:03.640 --> 06:05.440
you are doing the same.

06:05.600 --> 06:09.080
But now a new category of very honest people are there

06:09.240 --> 06:13.560
in this world who are seeking beyond.

06:13.720 --> 06:17.480
William Blake has called them men of God,

06:17.640 --> 06:21.680
those who will seek the truth

06:21.840 --> 06:26.600
and they will make other people also godly.

06:26.760 --> 06:30.440
That’s the time has come, this resurrection time has come we should say

06:30.600 --> 06:33.040
or this is the Last Judgment.

06:33.200 --> 06:37.160
This Last Judgment is going to be done

06:37.320 --> 06:39.520
by this Kundalini, the power within you.

06:39.680 --> 06:42.960
This is your own power

06:43.520 --> 06:45.520
which has to be awakened

06:45.680 --> 06:50.040
and once it is awakened it passes through these centers as told to you

06:50.200 --> 06:53.760
and lets you know that these are your problems.

06:53.920 --> 06:56.800
These are the problems of your chakras.

06:56.960 --> 07:00.480
They may be physical, may be emotional,

07:00.640 --> 07:05.560
they may be, could be also spiritual.

07:05.720 --> 07:07.440
And once you know these problems

07:07.600 --> 07:10.720
and if you know how to solve these problems

07:10.880 --> 07:18.480
you can be a very normal, sensible, balanced personality.

07:18.640 --> 07:20.960
That’s not the only thing that happens

07:21.120 --> 07:24.520
when you get your self realization.

07:24.680 --> 07:28.400
Firstly what happens to you is that

07:28.560 --> 07:32.960
when the Kundalini passes through your Agyna chakra

07:33.160 --> 07:37.320
then you become thoughtlessly aware.

07:37.480 --> 07:44.160
If you see all the sciences they have created about religion,

07:44.320 --> 07:49.080
talks and the whole thing, it’s just mental.

07:50.640 --> 07:55.960
It’s not inside, it’s not innate, built within.

07:56.120 --> 07:59.000
So one thought rises, another thought falls.

07:59.160 --> 08:02.160
Another thought rises and falls down,

08:02.320 --> 08:06.040
some come from the future, some come from the past,

08:06.200 --> 08:10.800
and we are jumping on the cusp of these thoughts.

08:10.960 --> 08:14.720
But if you say now, this is the present,

08:14.880 --> 08:17.840
stop your mind at the stop point

08:18.000 --> 08:19.640
which is the present, you can’t,

08:19.800 --> 08:22.760
you just can’t do it.

08:22.920 --> 08:26.960
Between these thoughts there is a gap.

08:27.160 --> 08:31.520
This gap is the present, but it’s so small, it’s so small

08:31.680 --> 08:34.120
that you cannot find it.

08:34.280 --> 08:38.680
But when the Kundalini passes through,

08:38.840 --> 08:42.920
then this center, then these two institutions as you see them,

08:43.080 --> 08:46.880
the conditioning and the ego are just sucked in.

08:47.040 --> 08:50.720
As a result you become thoughtlessly aware.

08:50.880 --> 08:52.560
Means there is no thought.

08:52.720 --> 08:55.680
But you are absolutely aware, very much more aware.

08:55.840 --> 08:59.040
For example if you look at this beautiful hall

08:59.200 --> 09:03.960
with the thoughtless awareness,

09:04.120 --> 09:07.520
then the whole picture becomes clear

09:07.680 --> 09:11.160
like a photo in your mind,

09:11.320 --> 09:18.040
whole thing is stored up into every detail so clearly

09:18.200 --> 09:20.560
because present is the truth,

09:20.720 --> 09:24.240
past is finished and future doesn’t exist.

09:24.400 --> 09:27.520
So to come to the present you have to have

09:27.680 --> 09:31.800
this new awareness called as thoughtless awareness.

09:31.960 --> 09:34.440
But when She crosses over

09:34.600 --> 09:37.400
and pierces through your fontanel bone area

09:37.560 --> 09:43.040
which is the actualization of your baptism.

09:43.200 --> 09:46.960
Just people talk of baptism, “Come along I’ll baptize you”.

09:47.120 --> 09:48.560
It’s not possible that way.

09:48.720 --> 09:51.080
It’s just an artificial ritual.

09:51.240 --> 09:54.080
Try to understand, this is not going to render

09:54.240 --> 09:56.640
that actual happening within you

09:56.800 --> 10:00.640
which is going to make you grow spiritually.

10:00.800 --> 10:03.320
So the actualization of baptism takes place

10:03.480 --> 10:07.120
and you can feel also from your fontanel bone area

10:07.280 --> 10:12.520
a kind of a cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming in.

10:13.880 --> 10:16.200
You feel extremely relaxed.

10:16.360 --> 10:21.560
Secondly that you jump into another higher awareness

10:21.720 --> 10:25.480
which we call, as collective consciousness.

10:25.640 --> 10:27.440
This means that

10:27.600 --> 10:31.200
not only that you can you feel your own centers on your fingertips,

10:31.360 --> 10:37.280
because these cool vibrations you can call

10:37.440 --> 10:39.840
them start flowing through your own hands,

10:40.000 --> 10:42.200
you can feel them.

10:42.360 --> 10:46.240
But also you get information about others

10:46.400 --> 10:50.360
as well as about yourself on these fingertips.

10:50.520 --> 10:57.920
Automatically you become like a person who is a computer.

10:58.080 --> 11:00.800
It starts working in such a wonderful manner

11:00.960 --> 11:04.200
that you can find out about any disease,

11:04.360 --> 11:08.720
any trouble without going through all the diagnosis or anything,

11:08.880 --> 11:12.640
and if you know how to cure these troubles, physically, mentally,

11:12.800 --> 11:16.680
you can definitely cure yourself and also others

11:16.840 --> 11:18.520
if you have reached that state

11:18.680 --> 11:23.400
and have permanently achieved it.

11:25.280 --> 11:28.240
This is what has to happen to us.

11:28.400 --> 11:31.680
All of us have to achieve that state

11:31.840 --> 11:35.120
which is your right to achieve it.

11:35.280 --> 11:38.880
Sahaja means with you is born.

11:39.040 --> 11:41.160
This yoga means the union.

11:41.320 --> 11:47.400
The union with this All Pervading Power of God’s love.

11:47.600 --> 11:53.360
It exists or not, we have never bothered to find out.

11:53.520 --> 11:56.280
We see these beautiful flowers,

11:56.440 --> 11:59.320
very beautiful flowers and everything around.

11:59.480 --> 12:01.840
When I came from Sydney I saw the beauty,

12:01.960 --> 12:06.480
the nature had just spread for the pleasure of human beings,

12:06.640 --> 12:09.960
we never even think how it has happened,

12:10.120 --> 12:12.560
what has worked it out, all these living things.

12:12.720 --> 12:15.880
We don’t even think how this eye of ours

12:16.040 --> 12:21.080
is such a beautiful camera, how it has been made,

12:21.240 --> 12:25.080
how is it this brain which is such a great computer,

12:25.240 --> 12:29.840
how is it made. Who has made it?

12:30.000 --> 12:33.360
They may say it is autonomous but who is this auto?

12:33.520 --> 12:35.040
We have never tried to find out.

12:35.200 --> 12:38.480
That there is this All Pervading Power of God’s love

12:38.640 --> 12:40.840
which has done all this living work

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
and now for us it is to feel that,

12:44.160 --> 12:47.840
that is the yoga is, the union with that Divine.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.520
It’s not physical, it’s not mental,

12:50.680 --> 12:52.800
but it is spiritual where

12:52.960 --> 12:57.280
you start first time feeling this All Pervading Power.

12:58.200 --> 13:01.320
Then only you have to know how to use this power

13:01.480 --> 13:04.200
which flows through you.

13:05.560 --> 13:08.920
But it moves very slowly and people,

13:09.080 --> 13:11.280
you see this is not a plastic work

13:11.440 --> 13:13.200
that you can go on producing many

13:13.360 --> 13:15.640
and we don’t have any organization as such,

13:15.800 --> 13:17.680
we do not organize people

13:17.840 --> 13:21.360
and we do not take any money at all, you cannot.

13:21.520 --> 13:24.520
How much can you pay for this Divine Work?

13:24.680 --> 13:27.720
How much do we pay to Mother Earth for what she gives us

13:27.880 --> 13:29.800
all these beautiful flowers?

13:29.960 --> 13:33.280
She doesn’t understand money, so you cannot pay for it.

13:33.440 --> 13:36.440
But there are many, many organizations afloat,

13:36.600 --> 13:40.080
which are taking money, which are giving you mental heat

13:40.240 --> 13:41.720
and people run after them,

13:41.880 --> 13:45.280
they like to go on working out that yarn

13:45.440 --> 13:49.080
that they have spun for you.

13:50.320 --> 13:55.000
One has to go beyond this mind to feel the spirituality.

13:55.160 --> 13:58.760
With this mind, that is human mind, you cannot understand it,

13:58.920 --> 14:00.960
you have to have Divine mind.

14:01.120 --> 14:03.080
But once you get your realization

14:03.240 --> 14:05.680
your mind also gets enlightened,

14:05.840 --> 14:10.160
and when your mind is enlightened, you can perceive,

14:10.320 --> 14:13.960
penetrate into every situation

14:14.120 --> 14:20.440
in such a deeper manner and the way you can improve it.

14:20.600 --> 14:23.800
I can tell you a simple analogy to understand.

14:23.960 --> 14:31.760
Supposing you are standing in the sea and the sea is rough,

14:31.920 --> 14:35.040
you are afraid of the waves, very much afraid.

14:35.200 --> 14:38.680
But supposing somebody puts you on the boat,

14:38.840 --> 14:42.800
and then you can see those waves and enjoy them.

14:42.960 --> 14:45.280
But supposing you learn how to swim

14:45.440 --> 14:48.080
then you can jump in and save them.

14:48.240 --> 14:50.360
It is not any brainwashing

14:50.520 --> 14:54.840
or any sort of a bombardment of words,

14:55.000 --> 14:57.760
but it is something that happens to you.

14:57.920 --> 15:01.360
You become something as you have become human beings,

15:01.520 --> 15:03.640
you become realized souls

15:03.800 --> 15:09.640
as a result of this last breakthrough of your evolution.

15:09.800 --> 15:12.560
This is happening everywhere no doubt

15:12.720 --> 15:15.440
and it’s working out very well in,

15:15.600 --> 15:18.840
I think they told me, 62 countries

15:19.000 --> 15:22.280
but at least I know of definitely of 52 countries

15:22.440 --> 15:24.880
where there We have got very strong centers

15:25.040 --> 15:27.760
where it is working out.

15:27.920 --> 15:29.920
Now whatever we are telling you here

15:30.080 --> 15:32.400
you need not accept blindfolded.

15:32.560 --> 15:35.400
Blind faith is of no use.

15:35.600 --> 15:38.680
First of all you must experience.

15:38.840 --> 15:42.400
Just like a hypothesis I am putting this before you,

15:42.560 --> 15:45.680
but you should have an open mind of a scientist.

15:45.840 --> 15:49.400
Just open your mind and see for yourself it works.

15:49.560 --> 15:52.280
If it works then you have to accept.

15:52.440 --> 15:54.480
If you are honest you have to accept.

15:54.640 --> 15:57.240
If it doesn’t work. If it works with many,

15:57.400 --> 15:59.760
why not try and work it out.

15:59.920 --> 16:03.080
Most of the people do get their realization. I have seen it.

16:03.240 --> 16:05.040
It’s a wonderful thing that is happening

16:05.200 --> 16:08.200
that masses of people can get realization.

16:08.360 --> 16:12.480
Depends on also certain places like Russia I was amazed.

16:12.640 --> 16:14.360
Where they have not heard the name of God

16:14.520 --> 16:15.920
they have never heard the name of Christ.

16:16.080 --> 16:18.960
They were not allowed to read Bible or any book,

16:19.120 --> 16:20.800
they had no religion at all.

16:20.960 --> 16:22.680
They believed in no religion.

16:22.840 --> 16:27.320
Where thousands and thousands come to My program

16:27.480 --> 16:30.200
and they all get their realization.

16:30.360 --> 16:32.840
In a small place called Togliati

16:33.000 --> 16:37.640
there are 22 thousand Sahaja Yogis practicing Sahaja Yoga.

16:37.800 --> 16:40.560
Can you imagine it? I was so amazed.

16:40.720 --> 16:46.000
Same about Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Poland.

16:46.160 --> 16:49.320
I was amazed how these people, Czechoslovakia,

16:49.480 --> 16:52.160
how they have taken to Sahaja Yoga so fast,

16:52.320 --> 16:55.680
just like fish to water,

16:55.840 --> 16:58.400
how they realized it, and nobody else,

16:58.560 --> 17:00.320
all these false people, could not go there,

17:00.480 --> 17:03.160
nothing could work out.

17:03.320 --> 17:05.600
Only thing that has really worked out there

17:05.760 --> 17:10.200
is something that is genuine. That is Sahaja Yoga.

17:10.360 --> 17:15.360
One has to realize that as we are not in the Absolute State,

17:15.520 --> 17:18.080
we have to reach to the Absolute State.

17:18.240 --> 17:21.440
That desire should be there.

17:21.600 --> 17:23.840
If that desire is there it works out

17:24.000 --> 17:25.840
without any difficulty.

17:25.960 --> 17:28.320
It is your own power which manifests

17:28.480 --> 17:31.400
and gradually you can manifest them in such a way

17:31.560 --> 17:36.480
that you can do so many things like giving realization to others,

17:36.640 --> 17:43.200
curing others and also enjoying it,

17:43.360 --> 17:49.320
because when the attention is filled with the light of the Spirit,

17:49.480 --> 17:53.600
it fills you up with complete joy,

17:53.760 --> 17:58.600
and joy has not two sides like happiness and unhappiness.

17:58.760 --> 18:04.200
It’s singular, it’s absolute and you are then,

18:04.360 --> 18:11.760
they say they are swimming in the ocean of joy.

18:11.920 --> 18:13.600
So beautiful it is.

18:13.760 --> 18:21.280
This new race, we can call it.

18:21.440 --> 18:24.720
The new society, is already formed.

18:24.880 --> 18:28.640
It’s there, they’re angel-like people, beautiful.

18:28.800 --> 18:31.720
I never tell them, don’t drink, don’t smoke,

18:31.880 --> 18:35.200
don’t take drugs, nothing of the kind. I don’t tell them,

18:35.360 --> 18:37.760
it just automatically drops out

18:37.920 --> 18:40.840
because in the light they see the ignorance that they had.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.440
They see the darkness and they just drop it.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.280
We don’t have to tell them anything,

18:45.440 --> 18:51.920
not to brainwash them or anything; it just works automatically.

18:52.080 --> 18:54.520
You don’t have to follow any kind

18:54.680 --> 18:57.760
of a fundamental groups or things, nothing of the kind.

18:57.920 --> 19:02.880
You just know this is fundamental because you have got

19:03.040 --> 19:05.880
the light within you, then they see the goodness,

19:06.040 --> 19:08.440
then they see the oneness of all the religions.

19:08.600 --> 19:11.040
So if you know the oneness of all the religions,

19:11.200 --> 19:13.120
why will you be fundamentalist?

19:13.280 --> 19:17.320
If you belong to one organization or to another church

19:17.480 --> 19:20.200
or to another religion then you fight.

19:20.360 --> 19:23.800
When you get into compartments like this, then only you fight.

19:23.960 --> 19:26.760
Everybody thinks we are the chosen ones,

19:26.920 --> 19:30.240
that’s how we have this fundamentalism now,

19:30.400 --> 19:34.200
knocking at our doors. So to get rid of it

19:34.360 --> 19:36.200
the best thing is. First of all

19:36.360 --> 19:38.680
you have to become a universal being,

19:38.840 --> 19:41.720
and this Spirit is the Universal Being.

19:41.880 --> 19:43.680
Once you become the Universal Being

19:43.840 --> 19:45.720
then you will be surprised to see it,

19:45.880 --> 19:50.120
that all these differences you saw because of complete ignorance.

19:50.280 --> 19:52.760
For example there is light you can see each other here,

19:52.920 --> 19:56.560
but supposing there is complete pitch darkness,

19:56.720 --> 20:00.360
you don’t know who’s sitting here, who is right, who is left..

20:00.520 --> 20:01.680
You don’t know how to walk.

20:01.840 --> 20:04.960
You may trample over people, you may just get frightened,

20:05.160 --> 20:07.480
you may run helter skelter.

20:07.640 --> 20:10.520
But if there is light you see things so clearly.

20:10.680 --> 20:13.680
In the same way Sahaja Yoga works first.

20:13.840 --> 20:16.760
Some people get not all the light I should say,

20:16.920 --> 20:20.440
but they do get a little light, a glimmer of light,

20:20.600 --> 20:22.960
and then it starts expanding. And when it expands

20:23.120 --> 20:26.880
you will be amazed how things work out.

20:27.040 --> 20:29.960
Also I have seen people after coming to Sahaja Yoga,

20:30.120 --> 20:33.640
they become extremely intelligent, absorbent,

20:33.800 --> 20:37.160
and a kind of a very dynamic personality comes in them.

20:37.320 --> 20:40.560
Now you have seen these Australians singing Sanskrit songs.

20:40.720 --> 20:42.840
I mean imagine, Sanskrit,

20:42.960 --> 20:45.920
even these English lived in India for 300 years,

20:46.080 --> 20:48.640
they couldn’t learn one sentence of Hindi language,

20:48.800 --> 20:52.960
leave alone Sanskrit, but the way they are singing with such

20:53.120 --> 20:55.840
clarity, even the Indians are surprised

20:56.000 --> 20:59.280
at how they are singing our songs in Sanskrit language.

20:59.440 --> 21:00.880
It is an impossibility,

21:01.040 --> 21:04.520
you cannot think of a Western person singing like this

21:04.680 --> 21:06.920
with all the rhythm and the melody and all that

21:07.080 --> 21:10.520
and in no time they pick it up.

21:10.680 --> 21:14.960
There are artists and artists who have now got world fame in India

21:15.160 --> 21:18.440
after coming to Sahaja Yoga. We have got here also

21:18.600 --> 21:23.480
some artists who were painters and have become very,

21:23.640 --> 21:27.600
have got a good name for themselves. Everything changes.

21:27.760 --> 21:31.440
You become on top of the world but you don’t become competitive,

21:31.600 --> 21:33.800
you start enjoying each other.

21:33.960 --> 21:37.840
Such a brotherhood, such love, such friendship,

21:38.000 --> 21:44.120
that you become one drop becoming an ocean,

21:44.280 --> 21:47.240
microcosm becoming the macrocosm.

21:47.400 --> 21:51.440
We talk about these things but we have never achieved it.

21:51.600 --> 21:56.080
Now the time has come for us to achieve all this.

21:56.240 --> 21:59.280
In this one lecture I know I can’t talk much.

21:59.440 --> 22:01.800
Last year also I was here

22:01.960 --> 22:05.280
and Lord Mayor was here also to grace the occasion.

22:05.440 --> 22:08.240
I found him to be a remarkable person,

22:08.440 --> 22:10.800
the way he got his realization.

22:10.960 --> 22:13.120
You are especially blessed people I think,

22:13.280 --> 22:17.000
Newcastle with this beautiful lake here

22:17.160 --> 22:21.480
and beautiful surroundings, and I hope that

22:21.640 --> 22:24.080
Sahaja Yoga will work out here very well.

22:24.240 --> 22:27.560
Gradually it will take its roots,

22:27.720 --> 22:31.760
and you can have a real good center in Newcastle.

22:31.800 --> 22:34.920
May God bless you all.
