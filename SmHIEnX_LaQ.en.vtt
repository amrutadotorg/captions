00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:53.590
So now, we all have arrived,
it’s all right.

00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:56.130
Now, this place has been chosen because
they said that

00:21:56.150 --> 00:21:58.730
there are lots of horrible people
the other way round.

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:03.230
Still, we are having their problems.
All right.

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:06.000
You see, you must know these are
modern times,

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:09.880
and modern times have lots
of complications.

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.830
Has everyone arrived?

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:16.590
I will first speak in English, then
in Marathi.

00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:21.860
As these people can’t understand anything
otherwise, and that won’t be proper.

00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:24.600
In these modern times,

00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:30.530
a place which is supposed to be a holy
place becomes the most unholy place.

00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:35.190
It’s such a topsy-turvy condition these
days.

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:40.460
And when we are trying to establish
something very fundamental,

00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:45.670
it’s like a little seedling that has
to come out of the stones, you see.

00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:50.480
It has to fight lots of things, so we have
to keep our brains intact

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:56.100
and be sensible about everything, and try
to see what we can achieve

00:22:56.120 --> 00:23:01.100
through our patience and understanding
- is very important.

00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:06.340
Today, I think, is a very great day
for all of us

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:15.580
because this place is the place of Virat,
of Shri Vitthala.

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:21.320
Is the place where Shri Vitthala appeared

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:27.030
to a devoted son

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:35.070
and when he asked Him that, "You better
stand on a brick," He stood there.

00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:44.610
And they say that He stood there waiting.

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:50.950
Some people say that the statue
that we see

00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:56.310
came out of the Mother Earth on this sand

00:23:57.180 --> 00:24:04.010
and that's what Pundarikaksh carried
saying that,

00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:11.850
"These are the ones who came to see my,
see me and my parents;

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:20.550
and I was busy with them, so they are
standing on the same brick which I threw."

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:31.250
Now the whole story has to be taken

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:39.650
in a very sensible way, with the
common-sense in it.

00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:47.890
That God Himself is capable of all kinds
of miracles.

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:56.690
We, who are created by God, are doing
some things which look miraculous.

00:24:56.710 --> 00:25:02.760
Say, if you take about hundred-year-old
situation of this world,

00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:08.770
we can say that today we are seeing many
things which could be miraculous.

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:13.000
Hundred years back, nobody could
have thought  that we could have

00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:20.030
all these arrangements done here in such
a far-fetched places.

00:25:20.050 --> 00:25:27.000
But all these miracles come from
the power of God.

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:31.480
So we are the creator

00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:38.130
of that wee bit, very wee bit of that
miracle.

00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:45.680
So all the miracles of God cannot be
explained and should not be explained.

00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:52.770
They are beyond our minds, and, to make
people feel the presence of God,

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:57.840
God can do anything. He can move
into all the three dimensions

00:25:57.870 --> 00:26:02.030
and also in the fourth dimension. He can
do whatever He feels like.

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:06.440
That's what you have seen now in your

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:12.840
every day-to-day life, how many miracles
take place to all of you,

00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:16.880
and you can't understand how it works out.

00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:21.380
Even it works out on things which are
not living,

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:25.280
and people are quite amazed how these
things happen.

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:31.560
So we have to believe, now, after seeing
all this ourselves,

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:34.590
that He is God,

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:39.010
and He can do anything that He feels like.

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:42.530
And we are nothing. We are nothing.

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:47.630
There should be no rationality about it
- of understanding God's miracles.

00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:53.380
"How can it be? How could it be?"
You can't explain.

00:26:54.740 --> 00:27:01.250
Only when you achieve that state of mind
where

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:09.180
you believe, through your experiences,

00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:17.540
that God is all-powerful.

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:25.830
It's very difficult. This concept is
very difficult

00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:30.520
because we are limited people, we have
limited powers,

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:33.770
we cannot understand how God could be
all-powerful

00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:39.080
because we, we haven't got the capacity.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.960
So this God

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:51.630
who is our Creator, who is our Preserver,

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:57.410
the One who desired that we should exist,
who is our existence itself,

00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:03.110
is an all-powerful God, all-powerful.

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:08.570
He can do whatever He likes with you.

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:13.260
He can create another world, He can
destroy this world.

00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:17.350
It's only if He has to desire.

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:25.580
My idea of coming to Pandharpur
for Shiva Puja was this:

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:29.230
that Shiva represents the Spirit,

00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:41.170
and the Spirit is residing in all of you
in your hearts.

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:50.670
The seat of Sadashiva is on top
of your head

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:56.800
but is reflected in your heart.

00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:04.370
Now, your brain is the Vitthala.

00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:10.920
So to bring Spirit to your brain

00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:18.460
means enlightenment of your brain.

00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:25.840
Enlightenment of your brain means

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:33.270
the limited capacity of your brain
has to become unlimited,

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:41.400
in its capacity to realize God.

00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:45.600
I will not use the word 'understand'
- but 'to realize God' -

00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:48.810
how powerful He is,

00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:53.430
how miraculous He is, how great He is.

00:29:55.800 --> 00:30:02.260
The another is that the brain of man

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:07.850
can create - of course, out of the dead;

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:16.580
but when the Spirit comes into brain,

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:22.620
then you create living things,

00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:28.000
living work of Kundalini.

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:34.180
Even the dead start behaving like living

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:40.810
because you touch the Spirit in the dead.

00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:46.510
Like the nucleus

00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:54.520
inside every atom or a molecule

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:59.370
has the Spirit of that molecule.

00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:03.270
And if you become your Spirit...

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:08.220
We can say the brain of

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:13.900
a molecule or an atom

00:31:13.930 --> 00:31:17.440
is like the nucleus, body of the nucleus.

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:20.610
But the one that controls the nucleus
is the Spirit

00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:23.570
that resides within the nucleus.

00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:29.200
So now you have got the attention,
or the body

00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:36.880
- the whole body of the atom - then
the nucleus,

00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:40.060
and inside the nucleus is the Spirit.

00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:45.600
In the same way - we have this body,
the attention of the body.

00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:54.110
And then we have the...

00:31:56.030 --> 00:32:01.240
we have the nucleus

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:07.330
- is the brain.

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:14.150
And the Spirit is in the heart.

00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:22.330
So the brain is controlled through
the Spirit.

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:25.340
How?

00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:31.050
That around the heart

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:35.350
there are seven auras

00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:42.740
which can be multiplied into any number,

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:46.380
seven raised to power sixteen hundred,

00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:53.840
which are the ones

00:32:55.960 --> 00:33:02.960
which watch the seven chakras,

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:06.470
raised to power sixteen hundred -

00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:10.020
sixteen thousand, sorry.

00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:20.790
Now this Spirit is watching through
this aura;

00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:27.460
watching - I am again saying “watching”
- through this aura.

00:33:27.490 --> 00:33:30.390
Can you sit down?

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:38.100
Can you sit down? I think, would be
better.

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:43.500
There is no need to bother, once you
have put it up.

00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:50.880
This aura is watching

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:58.510
the behaviour of your seven centres
in your brain.

00:33:58.830 --> 00:34:04.240
Is also watching all the nerves
that are working

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:07.800
in the brain - “watching”, again.

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:12.470
But when you bring the Spirit

00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:19.540
into your brain,

00:34:21.390 --> 00:34:25.220
then you go two steps ahead,

00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:32.520
because when your Kundalini rises,

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:42.210
She touches the Sadashiva
and Sadashiva informs the Spirit.

00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:47.090
Informs in the sense - reflects
in the Spirit.

00:34:47.490 --> 00:34:54.990
So that's the first state where
the watching auras

00:34:55.710 --> 00:35:01.400
start communicating

00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:09.850
through your different chakras
in the brain

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:13.180
and integrating it.

00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:18.720
But when you bring your Spirit
to your brain

00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:22.370
- this is the second state -

00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:30.340
then you really become self-realized,
in the full way,

00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:36.610
in the full way because then your Self,
that is the Spirit,

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:41.000
becomes your brain.

00:35:41.830 --> 00:35:45.520
Action is very dynamic,

00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:52.450
it opens then the fifth dimension
in the human being.

00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:59.870
First, when you become realized,
collectively conscious,

00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:07.270
and start raising the Kundalini, you are
in, you cross the fourth dimension.

00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:12.710
But when your Spirit comes into
your brain,

00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:19.780
then you become the fifth dimension
- means, you become the doer.

00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:28.410
Our brain, now, for example, says,
"All right, lift this thing up."

00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:34.370
So you touch it with your hand,
you lift it up. You are the doer.

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:41.250
But when the brain becomes the Spirit,
the Spirit is the doer,

00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:47.080
and when Spirit is the doer,

00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:52.520
then you become

00:36:53.570 --> 00:36:59.660
a complete Shiva - self-realized.

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:06.570
In that state, if you get angry,

00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:10.650
you are not attached.

00:37:12.010 --> 00:37:16.780
You are not an attached person to anything
whatsoever.

00:37:17.830 --> 00:37:20.720
If you possess anything, you are
not attached.

00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:25.070
You cannot attach because Spirit
is detachment,

00:37:25.090 --> 00:37:27.730
is complete detachment.

00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:34.280
You don't bother about any attachments
whatsoever.

00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:38.430
Even for a second, you are not attached.

00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:49.140
Now, I would say, to understand
the detachment of Spirit,

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:54.240
we should study ourselves very well,
clearly:

00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:57.550
“How are we attached?”.

00:37:57.580 --> 00:38:03.140
We are attached, firstly, by our brain,

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:10.130
mostly by our brain because all our
conditionings are in our brain,

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:15.110
and all our ego is also in our brain.

00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:25.550
So all emotional attachments are
through our brain,

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:32.070
and all our egoistical attachments, also,
are through our brain.

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:38.560
That's why it is said that after
Realization one must try to practice

00:38:38.590 --> 00:38:44.500
the Shiva Tattwa by practicing detachment.

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:47.610
Please, give Me the shawl.

00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:51.300
It’s so cold because of Shri Shiva.

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:56.760
Now how do you practice this detachment?

00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:03.390
All of you can understand English
a little bit, isn’t it?

00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:06.650
Because we get attached to something,
of course, through our brain,

00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:09.570
but through our attention.

00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:16.660
So we try to do what we call
Chitta Nirodh,

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:20.590
is to control your attention: where
is it going?

00:39:20.610 --> 00:39:25.670
In the practice of Sahaja Yoga, if you
have to rise higher,

00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:30.400
you have to improve your own instrument,
and not the instrument of others.

00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:34.870
This is one thing one should know,
for definite.

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:40.790
Now, you just watch your attention,
where is it going. Watch yourself.

00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:45.620
As soon as you’ll start watching yourself,
your attention, you’ll become

00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:49.210
more identified with your Spirit. Because
if you have to watch your attention,

00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:53.630
you have to be your Spirit, otherwise
how will you watch it?

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:57.870
So, now, see where is your attention
going.

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:07.290
First, the attachment is, in all gross
ways, to your body.

00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:15.090
So we see Shiva – He has no attachment
to His body.

00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:19.580
He sleeps anywhere.

00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:26.260
He goes to the cemeteries and He sleeps
there because He’s not attached.

00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:30.430
He can never be caught up by any bhoots
or anything, nothing of the kind.

00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:33.380
See, He is detached.

00:40:40.850 --> 00:40:50.100
The detachment is to be watched and seen
through your own attachments.

00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:56.140
Now, because you are realized souls,

00:40:56.170 --> 00:40:59.400
not yet the Spirit, has not come into
your brain, of course,

00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:03.780
but still you are realized souls. So what
you can do

00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:09.380
is at least to watch your attention,
you can do that.

00:41:11.350 --> 00:41:16.750
You can watch your attention very clearly

00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:23.240
by seeing where your attention is going.

00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:30.200
And then, controlling your attention,
also, you can do.

00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:32.770
Very simple:

00:41:35.370 --> 00:41:38.760
to control your attention

00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:45.450
you have to just remove your attention
from this to that.

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:49.210
Try to change your priorities.

00:41:49.970 --> 00:41:55.210
All this has to be done now, after
Realization - a complete detachment.

00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:59.140
So the body demands comfort,

00:41:59.170 --> 00:42:04.390
try to make body uncomfortable
a little bit. Try.

00:42:04.410 --> 00:42:08.820
What you think it to be comfortable,

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:13.390
try to make it little uncomfortable.
That's why people went to Himalayas.

00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:17.560
You see, coming to this place itself has
caused us lot of problems.

00:42:17.590 --> 00:42:21.400
But going to Himalayas - you can
imagine.

00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:26.010
So after Realization, they used to take
their body to Himalayas, "All right,

00:42:26.050 --> 00:42:30.160
go through all this. Let's see how
you act."

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:35.120
So what you call the penance side
starts now in a way.

00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:39.390
it's a penance which you can do very easily
because now you are realized souls.

00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:45.260
With enjoyment, little, try to make
this body...

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:52.250
For Shiva, it doesn't matter whether
He is in a cemetery

00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:58.550
or in His own Kailasha or anywhere.

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:06.740
Where is your attention is, you see.

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:16.360
That your human attention is hopelessly
bad. Very entangled nonsense it is.

00:43:17.650 --> 00:43:22.970
"We did this because of this." There is
an explanation.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.410
Or others have to give an explanation.
No explanation is needed

00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:32.920
to be given, or to be accepted, or to be
asked for. No explanation.

00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:38.270
To exist without explanation is the best
way.

00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:47.750
In a simple Hindi language, "Jaise rakhahu
taise hi rahu".

00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:52.310
"Whichever way you keep me I'll remain
in that state,

00:43:52.330 --> 00:43:56.390
and I’ll enjoy."

00:43:56.410 --> 00:44:00.740
Further in this poem, Kabira says,

00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:03.770
"If you make me go on an elephant”

00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:11.360
- means the royal conveyance - “I'll go.
If you make me walk, I'll walk."

00:44:11.950 --> 00:44:16.510
"Jaise rakhahu taise hi rahu".
So no reaction on that point,

00:44:16.530 --> 00:44:21.810
no reaction. First no explanation,
no reaction.

00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:32.130
Now, second is about food.

00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:37.680
But that’s the first seeking human
beings had as animals.

00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:41.370
No attention on food.

00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:47.630
Whether you have salt or not, whether
you have this or that

00:44:47.650 --> 00:44:50.660
- no attention on food.

00:44:54.330 --> 00:44:58.790
Actually, you should not remember
what you ate this morning.

00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:03.400
But we think as to what we are going
to eat tomorrow.

00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:11.610
We consume food not for running this body
but for sort of a

00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:18.510
more satisfaction of tongue pleasures.

00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:24.940
Once you start understanding that pleasure
is a sign of gross attention

00:45:26.930 --> 00:45:31.520
- any kind of pleasure is a very

00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:40.000
gross sensationalization - sensations.
Very gross it is.

00:45:40.850 --> 00:45:43.640
But when I say, "No pleasures," means,
doesn't mean that you should become

00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:49.600
serious people and people of, sort of,

00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:53.990
as if somebody is dead in your family!

00:45:54.950 --> 00:46:01.170
But you should be like Shiva.
So detached.

00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:05.570
He came on a bull, which was running
very fast, to get married.

00:46:05.590 --> 00:46:08.800
He was sitting on a bull with His two feet
like this, you see,

00:46:08.830 --> 00:46:12.520
and the bull is running fast and He is
holding the bull.

00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:15.370
The feet like this!

00:46:19.930 --> 00:46:23.060
And He’s coming for His wedding.

00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:27.000
And with Him are coming people
with one eye,

00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:31.860
without noses, all kinds of funny people
coming with Him.

00:46:32.350 --> 00:46:37.480
And His wife feeling quite embarrassed
at the nonsensical

00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:42.010
things people are talking about Shiva.

00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:47.770
He is not bothered what’s His reputation
would be, this thing.

00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:53.240
But that doesn't mean that you become
hippies. You see this is the problem is:

00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:57.800
that once you start thinking like that,
you become hippies.

00:46:57.830 --> 00:47:03.670
Many people believe that if you try to
behave like Shiva, you become Shiva.

00:47:03.690 --> 00:47:09.910
Many believe that way: that if you take
ganja, you become Shiva

00:47:09.930 --> 00:47:14.230
because Shiva used to take ganja. Because
He used, He was consuming all that

00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:17.940
to finish off from this world.

00:47:17.970 --> 00:47:20.350
For Him what does it matter whether
it's a ganja or anything?

00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:25.920
Give Him anything, He’ll never get drunk,
no question. He is consuming all that.

00:47:25.950 --> 00:47:28.820
Or they think, if they live like Shiva,

00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:39.180
the way He was detached about things,
least bothered about His appearances.

00:47:39.810 --> 00:47:45.430
What appearance Shiva needs is that,
whatever He appears as His beauty.

00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:49.010
He doesn't need anything to be done.

00:47:53.060 --> 00:48:01.810
So attachment to anything is ugliness.

00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:05.900
Is ugliness, is nonsense.

00:48:06.930 --> 00:48:11.040
But you can dress up whatever way
you like,

00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:14.910
or even if you are in the most ordinary
dress,

00:48:14.930 --> 00:48:19.090
you will look the most magnificent person.

00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:23.960
But it's not that if you, if you say that,
"All right, so under these circumstances,

00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:29.910
let us go about on a one sheet wrapped
around".

00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:34.280
The beauty that has evolved within you
through Spirit,

00:48:34.310 --> 00:48:38.100
gives you that power that you can wear
whatever you feel like -

00:48:38.130 --> 00:48:43.400
makes no difference to your beauty,
your beauty is there all the time.

00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:46.860
But have you achieved that state?

00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:54.900
And that state only you achieve when
your Spirit enters into your brain.

00:48:54.920 --> 00:49:00.240
With ego-oriented people is more difficult,
and that’s why they cannot enjoy things.

00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:04.340
At the slightest pretext, they topple
down.

00:49:05.710 --> 00:49:11.660
And Spirit, which is the source of joy,
just doesn't come in,

00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:19.300
doesn't show. The joy is beauty.
The joy itself is beauty.

00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:26.370
But that is a state one has to achieve.

00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:30.890
Attachments come by various methods.

00:49:31.610 --> 00:49:37.890
If you go little ahead with it, then you
have attachments of your family,

00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:40.990
“What will happen to my child? What will
happen to my husband?

00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:46.800
What will happen to my mother, to my
wife?", this, that nonsense.

00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:56.060
Who is your father and who is your mother?
Who is your husband and who is your wife?

00:49:56.090 --> 00:49:59.910
For Shiva, He doesn't know all these
things.

00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:06.720
To Him, He and His Power are inseparable
things.

00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:12.520
So He stands as singular personality.

00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:21.070
There is no dual... duality. When there is
duality, then only you say, “my wife.”

00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:29.590
You go on saying, “my nose, my ears,
my hands,

00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:34.880
my, my, my, my.” Go, go, go deep down.

00:50:34.910 --> 00:50:39.980
Till you say “my”, there is some duality.

00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:50.180
But when I say, "I, the nose", then
there is no duality.

00:50:50.210 --> 00:50:55.960
Shiva the Shakti, Shakti the Shiva.
There’s no duality.

00:50:55.980 --> 00:51:02.210
But we live throughout on our duality,
and because of that,

00:51:02.230 --> 00:51:07.140
there is an attachment. If there is no
duality, what is the attachment, you see?

00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:13.130
If you are the light and you are the lamp,
then where is the duality?

00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:19.040
If you are the moon and you are the
moonlight, then where is the duality?

00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:22.360
If you are the sun and you are
the sunlight,

00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:29.770
you are the word and you are the meaning,
then where is the duality?

00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:34.780
But when there is this separation,
there is duality,

00:51:34.810 --> 00:51:37.980
and because of this separation, you feel
attached.

00:51:38.010 --> 00:51:42.290
Because if you are that, how will you
be attached?

00:51:43.140 --> 00:51:45.610
Do you see that point?

00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:53.080
Because there is a difference and
a distance between you and yours,

00:51:53.110 --> 00:52:00.500
that's why you get attached to it.
But it's me, who is the other?

00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:06.100
This whole universe is me, who is
he other?

00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:08.560
Everything is me, who is the other?

00:52:08.590 --> 00:52:13.530
But it's not that, it's a brainwave
or a ego brain wave.

00:52:13.550 --> 00:52:16.320
Sit down, sit down. I will ask if I need
something. It’s disturbing others.

00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:18.380
Sit down. We are talking about a very
important topic.

00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:20.980
I won’t need anything at this moment.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:24.610
Even if I sit for nine hours I won’t
need anything.

00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:30.100
Please sit without worrying. You should
not disturb. Sit, please.

00:52:31.790 --> 00:52:34.920
So who is the other?

00:52:36.310 --> 00:52:38.630
Nobody!

00:52:38.940 --> 00:52:45.260
That's only possible when your Spirit
comes into your brain,

00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:52.610
and you become part and parcel of Virat
Itself. Virat is the brain, as I told you.

00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:03.380
Then everything that you do - when you
show your temper,

00:53:03.410 --> 00:53:07.030
when you show your affection, when you
show your compassion, anything -

00:53:07.050 --> 00:53:13.000
is the Spirit that is expressing, because
brain has lost its identity.

00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:19.850
The so-called limited brain, it has
become the unlimited Spirit.

00:53:21.290 --> 00:53:24.360
I do not know,

00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:34.310
I really do not know, how to give
an analogy to a thing like that.

00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:39.460
But what we can do is to understand it,

00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:52.060
that if a colour is dropped in the ocean,

00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:04.920
the ocean becomes colourful -

00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:11.200
is not possible.

00:54:15.690 --> 00:54:17.930
But -

00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:33.850
try to understand, if a little colour,
limited colour, is dropped into the ocean,

00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:38.690
the colour loses its identity completely.

00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:47.310
Think of the other way round.
If the ocean is coloured,

00:54:50.140 --> 00:54:57.900
and is poured into atmosphere

00:55:00.450 --> 00:55:06.290
or onto any part, any, any little wee bit,

00:55:06.310 --> 00:55:16.650
or onto any spot, onto any atom or
anything, it all becomes colourful.

00:55:18.130 --> 00:55:26.890
So the Spirit is like the ocean,
which has the light in it.

00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:36.240
And when this ocean pours into
the little cup of our brain,

00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:44.550
the cup loses its identity, and everything
becomes spiritual. Everything.

00:55:44.570 --> 00:55:47.350
You can make everything spiritual,
everything. You touch anything,

00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:52.720
is spiritual: this sand becomes spiritual,
the land becomes spiritual,

00:55:52.750 --> 00:55:58.050
atmosphere becomes spiritual,
celestial bodies become spiritual.

00:55:58.080 --> 00:56:01.960
Everything becomes spiritual.

00:56:02.450 --> 00:56:09.600
So is the ocean that is the Spirit,
while your brain is limited.

00:56:11.060 --> 00:56:17.390
So the detachment from your limited brain
has to be brought in.

00:56:17.410 --> 00:56:22.960
All limitations of brain should be broken,
so that when this ocean

00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:32.700
fills that brain, it should break
that little cup,

00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:37.630
and every bit of that cup should become
colourful.

00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:44.400
The whole atmosphere, everything,
whatever you locate, should be colourful.

00:56:44.430 --> 00:56:47.740
Colour of the Spirit is the light
of the Spirit;

00:56:47.770 --> 00:56:55.470
and this light of the Spirit acts, works,
thinks, coordinates, does everything.

00:56:55.490 --> 00:57:03.710
This is the reason today I decide
to bring Shiva Tattwa to the brain.

00:57:04.990 --> 00:57:09.720
The first procedure is to take your brain
towards the Shiva Tattwa by telling it,

00:57:09.740 --> 00:57:14.430
"See, where are you going, Mr. Brain?

00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:18.390
You're putting attention to this,
you're putting attention to that,

00:57:18.410 --> 00:57:22.000
getting involved - now detach, become
the brain yourself.

00:57:22.020 --> 00:57:26.070
Only the brain. Detach, Detach".

00:57:26.100 --> 00:57:31.620
And then, take this detached brain,
completely filled with the colour

00:57:31.650 --> 00:57:36.160
of the Spirit. It will automatically
happen.

00:57:36.190 --> 00:57:45.500
As long as you'll have these limitations
to your attention, it will not happen.

00:57:46.610 --> 00:57:55.500
So one has to really, deliberately
do this tapasya. Every individual.

00:57:57.760 --> 00:58:00.400
I'm with you;

00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:06.970
so you don't need any puja that way.

00:58:06.990 --> 00:58:16.490
But that state has to be achieved, and for
achieving that state, you need the puja.

00:58:19.180 --> 00:58:26.530
I hope, so many of you'll become
the Shiva Tattwas in My lifetime.

00:58:31.100 --> 00:58:34.480
But don't think I'm asking you to suffer.

00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:39.380
There is no suffering in this kind
of an ascent.

00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:44.720
If you understand that this is the complete
joyous state,

00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:48.030
that is the time when you become
Nirananda.

00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:52.680
That's the joy named in the Sahasrara,

00:58:52.710 --> 00:58:58.610
the name of the joy is Nirananda, and
you know your Mother's name is Nira.

00:58:58.630 --> 00:59:02.400
So you become Nirananda.

00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:13.720
So today's worship of Shiva has a special
meaning.

00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:20.290
I hope, whatever we do in the outward way,
in a gross way,

00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:24.340
happens also in the subtler way.

00:59:24.370 --> 00:59:27.980
I'm trying to push your Spirits into
your brains,

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:36.390
but I find it rather, sometimes, difficult
because your attention is still involved.

00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:48.240
Try to detach yourself. Temper,
lust, greed - everything.

00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:55.460
Try to reduce. Like in food I told
today Warren,

00:59:55.480 --> 01:00:00.000
"Ask them to eat less, not like gluttonous
people." You see, once in a while,

01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:04.270
on a day of a big banquet or anything,
you eat more,

01:00:04.290 --> 01:00:11.360
but you can't eat every time like that.
It's not a sign of a sahaja yogi.

01:00:12.830 --> 01:00:17.770
Try to control. Try to control your
speech.

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:23.470
Whether you express temper in your
speech or you express your compassion

01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:27.900
or you are artificially compassionate
- try to control.

01:00:27.930 --> 01:00:33.470
I know, some of you may not do much.
It's all right.

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:37.990
I'll try to tell you many-a-times.
I'll try to help you.

01:00:38.010 --> 01:00:45.420
But most of you can do it, and you
should try that.

01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:51.800
So, on a deeper level, from today we
start our Sahaja Yoga,

01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:59.290
where some of you may not attain.

01:00:59.310 --> 01:01:04.060
But most of you should try to go deeper.
Everyone.

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:07.260
For that, you don't need persons
who are very well educated

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:11.470
or well placed in life. No, not at all.

01:01:11.490 --> 01:01:16.980
But people who meditate, dedicate,
go deeper,

01:01:17.010 --> 01:01:21.170
because they are like the first roots,

01:01:21.190 --> 01:01:29.110
which have to reach for others much
deeper, so that others can follow.

01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:43.290
Now for today's Puja, we’ll have a very
short Ganesh Atharva Sheersh.

01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:49.500
Just not washing My feet or anything
much on it,

01:01:49.530 --> 01:01:55.830
but is a saying of Atharva Sheersha,
and you can put...

01:01:59.010 --> 01:02:04.120
That is during Shiva puja there is no need
to wash My feet, as He’s already pure.

01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:08.910
Shiva is all the time clean,

01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:15.260
pure, immaculate. So what are you going
to wash the Immaculate?

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:18.610
One may say that, "Mother, when You
wash Your Feet,

01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:23.030
we get Your vibrations in the water."

01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:30.250
But so detached that there’s no need
to wash,

01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:34.260
at a state

01:02:36.410 --> 01:02:44.210
where you get completely washed,
completely cleaned out.

01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:59.420
Then we’ll have a Devi Puja because Gauri,
who is Virgin, is to be worshipped.

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:03.760
So we’ll say the hundred-and-eight names
of the Virgin,

01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:07.360
then we’ll do the Shiva Puja.

01:03:09.670 --> 01:03:16.670
I'm sorry, I cannot tell you everything
in one short speech all about this,

01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:26.700
but detachment must start expressing
itself in your Realization.

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:29.590
Detachment.

01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:35.490
What is surrendering? Is nothing

01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:42.600
because when you are detached, you are
surrendered, automatically.

01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:48.130
When you are holding onto other things
you are not surrendered, that's all.

01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:50.960
What is there to surrender Me? I am such
a detached person,

01:03:50.980 --> 01:03:54.510
I don't understand all that. I mean,
what am I to get out of you?

01:03:54.530 --> 01:03:58.350
I am so detached. Nothing.

01:04:04.070 --> 01:04:10.800
So today I hope, we all pray that,
"Oh Lord, give us strength

01:04:11.590 --> 01:04:15.420
and that source of attraction

01:04:15.450 --> 01:04:19.160
by which we give up all other attractions
of all the pleasures,

01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:22.850
of joy of ego, of everything that we
think of,

01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:33.470
but we should fall into the pure joy form
of the Shiva Tattwa. Absolutely.”

01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:37.200
I hope I've been able to explain to you
why I am here today,

01:04:37.230 --> 01:04:40.500
and why today is a very big day.

01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:44.600
You all, who are here, are specially
very lucky people,

01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:49.380
who should think that God has been
kind to you,

01:04:49.410 --> 01:04:55.140
that He has chosen you today to be here
to listen to this.

01:04:58.390 --> 01:05:03.240
And then, once you get detached,
you'll start feeling responsible -

01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:06.720
Abhiyukta - responsible.

01:05:06.750 --> 01:05:13.170
But a responsibility, not giving ego,
but responsibility

01:05:13.190 --> 01:05:17.590
which is executing by itself,

01:05:17.610 --> 01:05:23.030
which is expressing by itself, manifesting
by itself.

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:29.060
May God bless you.
