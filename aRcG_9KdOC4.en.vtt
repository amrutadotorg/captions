Evening Program, Eve of Mahashivaratri Puja
Australia, 25 February 1995

00:10.182 --> 00:14.999
[Shri Mataji's talk starts at the end of
the evening program: minute 02:34:50)

02:34:50.619 --> 02:34:55.096
Congratulations to Brian Bell and to
all the…

02:35:23.902 --> 02:35:28.568
I said congratulations to Brian Bell

02:35:52.313 --> 02:35:56.401
and to all the actors and actresses.

02:36:07.148 --> 02:36:12.102
To be very frank I never think of my past.

02:36:13.454 --> 02:36:18.783
So I was wondering what is this drama
going about.

02:36:22.239 --> 02:36:30.860
The most important thing in this life is
to enlighten as many people as possible.

02:36:31.061 --> 02:36:34.778
I am very much thankful to you

02:36:36.335 --> 02:36:42.073
for expressing your joy,

02:36:42.274 --> 02:36:54.967
your talents to express the reality.

02:36:56.579 --> 02:37:04.290
Reality is not in which what we believe but
it is beyond.

02:37:04.498 --> 02:37:11.979
But the way people believe in reality is
something illusion, illusionary.

02:37:12.180 --> 02:37:16.975
That is the curse of Kali Yuga.

02:37:17.176 --> 02:37:19.477
I must say it is brought out very well,

02:37:19.678 --> 02:37:27.239
the way you showed people around, but not
easy to convince so easily, I tell you.

02:37:28.587 --> 02:37:33.887
Now it’s different. It used to be very
difficult in the beginning –

02:37:34.088 --> 02:37:43.231
too many arguments and all kinds of funny
answers and questions.

02:37:43.432 --> 02:37:52.191
Now life has changed I think – we are so
many, so many good Sahaja Yogis,

02:37:52.392 --> 02:38:02.609
and in Australia I am sure it’s going to be
a very tremendous success.

02:38:02.810 --> 02:38:10.447
I was surprised at the way people had
to stand outside in that big hall,

02:38:10.648 --> 02:38:12.919
shows the awakening is spreading

02:38:13.169 --> 02:38:19.320
and people are now trying to understand
that there is something beyond.

02:38:19.521 --> 02:38:27.122
It’s only your behaviour, it’s only your
vibrations which has created this.

02:38:27.323 --> 02:38:33.209
If I could do everything myself alone,
I would not have needed anyone.

02:38:33.410 --> 02:38:40.446
But no I can’t do it, I have to have
channels, and I have to do it through you.

02:38:40.647 --> 02:38:46.081
When the channels are so good, they are
working it out for me.

02:38:46.282 --> 02:38:52.248
Now I look back sometimes because just now
you were showing the past

02:38:52.582 --> 02:38:59.423
that first coming to Australia I just
thought

02:38:59.624 --> 02:39:07.304
it’s a Ganesha’s land and things will
work out.

02:39:07.505 --> 02:39:11.809
It has, I must say, it has worked out very
well.

02:39:12.010 --> 02:39:14.604
So many people are showing their talents.

02:39:14.805 --> 02:39:19.294
It’s amazing how they can sing Indian songs

02:39:19.495 --> 02:39:23.791
or do these Indian dancing, it’s very
amazing.

02:39:23.992 --> 02:39:30.984
And this play of Shiva was also another
great achievement I think

02:39:31.184 --> 02:39:41.025
in expressing how all the religions said
the same thing.

02:39:42.199 --> 02:39:49.893
But as you know people have misinterpreted
for their own purposes.

02:39:50.094 --> 02:39:54.993
I am so very happy all of you had found out
the reality about yourself,

02:39:55.218 --> 02:40:01.462
the reality about life and the Spirit that
is within you.

02:40:01.757 --> 02:40:09.288
I never expected so much to happen in my
lifetime, I thank you for that.

02:40:09.489 --> 02:40:12.457
May God bless you all.
