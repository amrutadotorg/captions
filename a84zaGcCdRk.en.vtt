00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.980
Today we have assembled here to do the Puja of Vishnumaya.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:36.230
Vishnumaya is created through human effort, also.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:43.150
As you see the clouds, when they rub against each other,

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:52.820
then the electricity is created. So first the clouds have to be created.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:02:02.520
The sun acts on the sea. See how many chakras come into play.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.530
Sea is the Void, and the sun acts on the sea.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:16.820
Also the moon acts on the sea. As a result of that, clouds are created.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:30.650
This electricity is not created in the ocean -- that would create problems.

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:41.650
Is created in the sky so that everybody can see it, can hear it.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:48.780
They see it first and hear it later.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:55.900
It's all well organized, well calculated. That is Vishnumaya.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:04.610
But it was created, also, with some understanding

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.440
by human beings on this earth. First of all they saw

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:16.030
the two clouds rubbing each other.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.780
So in the primitive stage, human beings

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.650
tried to rub two material things to create electricity.

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.980
So two material things, that is two parts of matter,

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:36.230
when rubbed created the electricity. It's very significant to see:

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.030
matter can be used to create electricity.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:46.730
The spark of the electricity comes from the matter.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.480
Without matter, they could not have started cooking the food.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.360
So how it has helped the Void.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:02.780
First from the ocean, it went into the sky, gave the message to the people

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.150
to create the electricity. See the love.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.900
Then people learned how to cook the food

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:22.860
for the digestion to be easier for human beings. How it comes back! From nature,

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.070
how human beings learn

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:38.650
and do it for the good, betterment, hita, of human beings. This benevolent energy,

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:45.190
which was meant for the benevolence of human beings, again was utilized.

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:50.440
As you see, this is the creation, all this is of Vishnumaya.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:56.820
That's why it's a maya. With electricity you can create a maya,

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.900
you know that very well, how you can create it. So many are here,

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.440
luckily in such a spontaneous way,

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.530
so many who are dealing with this electricity in creating maya.

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:19.280
America is so much helped by this electricity, by Vishnumaya.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.520
You're not thankful to it.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.900
Like you have got Niagara Falls, you have so many falls here.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.230
Again, the water when it falls -- it comes from water --

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:42.440
when the water falls on the lower level, very lower level, then it moves the turbine

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.070
and those movements can create electricity.

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:53.480
So you have hydrostatic electricity.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.650
Also the electricity is produced, as you know, through coal.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:05.520
Now here, again, the Mother Earth works out for the betterment

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:14.650
of human beings to create the coal in Her being.

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:21.440
I think She must be taking all the baddhas, absorbing all of them in Her stomach,

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.440
and must be burning the stones inside Her to make the coal.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:32.440
And then that coal is used for making electricity.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:39.110
How much the nature is working for our betterment!

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:43.110
Your New York would not have been there but for electricity.

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.110
It stopped for fifteen minutes

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:51.940
and you knew the power of electricity.

00:06:51.940 --> 00:07:00.230
You cannot move without it. We cannot exist without it. That's why it had to be used and created --

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:05.940
given you so much of benevolence. You cook with it; you see with it;

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:11.360
you listen with it; you enjoy with it. You wouldn't have your televisions;

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.820
you wouldn't have anything without electricity.

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:16.940
You won't even have these "Exits" here written.

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.650
You would have walked into the walls.

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:24.780
So much of this Vishnumaya has worked,

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:28.690
but She is a Maya. She can create a maya.

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:32.690
And this has created a big maya in the minds of human beings

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:36.520
that we are on top of the world. You're not.

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:46.480
If electricity recedes from you, you'll become again

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:52.900
the same primitive people making electricity out of rubbing the stones -- take it from Me.

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:59.480
This flow of electricity is available to you for your good,

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:06.780
and not for your destruction. But what has happened today

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:11.610
is that using this electricity for your destruction.

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:16.690
I remember about, say, thirty, forty years back, or even earlier

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:22.230
when we saw the films, they were not colored films, American films

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:28.900
were beautiful films with substance in it. They wouldn't show one married man

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:32.400
running after another married woman. None of these stories.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:37.860
Very pure form of beautiful family life.

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:42.650
Everything nourishing was shown.

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:50.940
We don't hear of any such thing where they showed evil winning over.

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:56.690
Now you find they show a thief, and the thief becomes the hero.

00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:04.190
Then the people see those films, and the children especially

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:09.530
I've seen have that thief as the symbol of something great.

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:14.570
So they are going against the Void completely,

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:17.440
against the religion that is within us, absolutely.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:27.820
The thing that was to nourish the Void, the one that was to sustain you

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:35.400
in your valences, is now disturbing the Void completely.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:40.030
That's the maya part of it - the same electricity

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:45.320
which was to give you the right path, the light in the darkness,

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:53.520
is now sucking you in like a magnet towards your destruction.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:10:01.480
This is the Vishnumaya Who came to this country in such a big way

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:07.480
and then spread all over. Has given ideas to everyone.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:12.070
People picked up all your techniques, all your styles,

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:17.150
I mean you have Hollywood and all these very famous people

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:20.150
here who have thrived on this electricity.

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:26.320
But without thanking the Vishnumaya, they started doing things

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:32.780
which were against Vishnumaya. This Vishnumaya is the One Who has helped you

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:37.070
because She is the Sister of Shri Krishna;

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:41.320
and because this is the domain of Shri Krishna, She came down here to help you.

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:44.440
Now She's the Sister -- this must be understood very well.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:48.610
Now sisterly relation is a pure relationship.

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:53.650
Now, of course, everything is so confused, but that's the purest relationship

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:56.570
between the brother and the sister.

00:10:56.610 --> 00:11:01.650
The brother is protected by sister.

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:12.520
And the sister's chastity is looked after by the brother.

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:14.980
A brother who doesn't feel hurt

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:20.860
if his sister chastity is in danger

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:24.730
or she plays about with her chastity, he is not a brother.

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:28.480
He is not a brother anymore. He's responsible

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:32.320
to see that his sister keeps her chastity.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:37.860
Only her chastity can protect him -- it's a mutual working.

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:45.320
This feeling, if it does not develop that, "She is my sister

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:49.280
and that I have to look after her chastity,

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.230
for that I have to behave myself well,

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:54.030
so that she doesn't find faults with me."

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:57.650
It's such a cleansing process this relationship has,

00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:01.730
as much as the electricity has the cleansing process for you.

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:05.570
Everywhere what the electricity does,

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:09.820
a sister does for her brother -- she cooks for him,

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:16.520
she tells him the right path, she enlightens him and sometimes

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:22.520
shocks him, also. They have to have certain shocks;

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:25.690
otherwise they will not know how to work it out.

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:30.440
And the best of all, she's the one for whom you have to be

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:35.980
very careful to know the technique how to handle your sister.

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:39.520
If you do not know how to handle your sister,

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:42.570
you can be absolutely wrong

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:49.190
and you may get it -- something that you would never expect to get.

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:53.480
So one must understand how to handle a sister.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:57.230
In this case, we have to know that the same

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:03.440
was born again at the time of Shri Krishna as Draupadi.

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:14.070
She took Her birth as Draupadi. And when Draupadi was attacked by the Kauravas,

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:19.480
they wanted to remove Her sari.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:26.980
So remove the sari itself is a symbol that they challenged her chastity.

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:31.280
Now if you see in the Maya Nagri, women have no sense at all

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:36.820
that they should cover this part of their body.

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:39.650
In this Maya Nagri, the other way round.

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:44.320
When I heard the very responsible person saying that, "In our culture,

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:50.780
women must expose their body." What is this culture? Is anti-Krishna,

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:55.780
completely anti-Vishnumaya. Such people

00:13:55.780 --> 00:14:02.480
will get into trouble, I'm sure, with electrical problems.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:17.230
The brothers who do not bother about the chastity of the husband of their sister,

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:28.980
and also supporting and asking to do wrong things, hide his things,

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:37.690
are also equally responsible. Like in Sahaja Yoga, you know

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:43.030
that a sister is to be protected; and the sister husband,

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:47.820
if he's doing anything wrong, he's to be told off by the brother.

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:54.780
Like once in India, one newspaper passed some remarks about Me.

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:58.480
My brothers were up in arms. I thought,

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:01.030
"Now, it's going to be terrible. How am I to manage it?"

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:06.940
It was a big, strong ... They were going to go to the courts. When I told them, "I'll not go to the courts."

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:08.650
"All right, don't go. But we'll go."

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:11.940
They told My husband also. My husband and My brothers put together,

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:15.940
it was formidable! I didn't know what to do.

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:20.860
I wrote to one Sahaja Yogi that, "Go and see the editor of the newspaper.

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:22.440
Tell him that these are My brothers,

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:27.940
be careful. They are very powerful people in India and from here My husband. It's terrible."

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:33.860
But they would not apologize. So I thought of another Vishnumaya

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:43.980
that there was a big strike and the paper was closed for exactly six months.

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:50.820
And they had to go in for a big, very big losses. And when they started,

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:55.860
the people who were working there came back and said that,

00:15:55.900 --> 00:16:00.440
"Why did you write against Shri Mataji? We're not going to come back."

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:03.440
And they had to apologize.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:10.230
So how the brother's love can compel even Adi Shakti

00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:17.480
to do things that She would not normally do. In the same way,

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:23.650
when Draupadi was challenged, Shri Krishna was not in Hastinapur

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:33.480
where it happened. He was thousand, at least more than thousand miles away from that place.

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:43.480
He said that, "Shankha chakra gada padma, garuda lai sidhare."

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:51.030
He came on His condor with all His weapons -- shankha, chakra, gada, padma.

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:57.360
All these He brought to save the chastity of His Sister.

00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:00.110
There are many incidents in our history,

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:06.230
I don't know if I can cite anything in your history. But I would say

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:11.150
when I see Abraham Lincoln I think he was a great brother

00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:19.110
to the Statue of Liberty. The way he fought for women

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:23.780
in such pure love and without taking any money,

00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:36.190
without charging them anything, to punish the husbands who were drunkards.

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:41.570
That's just like a very good, powerful brother to behave.

00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:47.110
But those feelings are now dying out I think.

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:56.400
But say in Russia, when I went, went to see Lenin's house and through out,

00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:01.480
apart from his wife, was his sister who helped him --

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:06.110
to type for him, to do all his official work.

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:13.650
He has written volumes and volumes of books in that small age

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:16.190
of fifty-four years, volumes!

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:20.320
First of all he was in Siberia and just imagine,

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:24.400
this sister of his has typed most of it.

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:31.150
Throughout in the whole tour, we felt the presence of the sister

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:34.690
and the way she has helped her brother.

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:40.900
This relationship is so pure which doesn't want anything.

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:45.650
A wife may say that, "If you don't give me a coat, I'll divorce you."

00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:49.150
May in England and possibly in America they say so.

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:55.230
But a sister cannot divorce. She cannot divorce.

00:18:55.230 --> 00:19:00.190
This time in the newspaper, they published the name of My brother.

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:04.110
So I said, "What can I do? He's My brother, so he's My brother."

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:12.820
Good, bad, anything, he's My brother, I cannot divorce.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:19.360
It's something, a relationship which you cannot break.

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:23.480
Nature has given you this relationship.

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:27.690
But when you come to the collective, it's very important

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:36.440
that we must respect this relationship. If you do not respect this relationship,

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:43.730
you cannot work out collectively. Like in a party I go

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:48.070
and I feel something very funny happening.

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:54.150
Somebody's wife is entangled with somebody's husband.

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:58.820
All sorts of funny things happen. But in collective

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:03.150
if you know, except for my wife the rest of them are my sisters.

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:05.230
The purity settles in like that,

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:09.030
you don't have to worry. They're my sisters.

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:14.820
And your eyes steady out.

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:18.400
Innocence starts pouring out of your eyes.

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:25.320
It's a very, very simple thing. So in the eye, when you get your Realization,

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:29.230
you get a glint -- must have seen, there's a shine

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:35.190
that is Vishnumaya. That is the Vishnumaya which shines through your eyes.

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:40.190
And She's the One Who makes you through the maya of Vishnumaya.

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:45.280
This glint in the eye you must have seen in people who are realized souls

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:55.570
and this glint in the eye is the one that makes you understand and feel the beauty

00:20:55.570 --> 00:21:02.610
and the power of sisterly/brotherly relationship.

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:11.190
In the beginning of Sahaja Yoga, I found it impossible to establish this.

00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:20.030
So I said, "Let's try the Vishnumaya." And it worked.

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:23.860
Actually, naturally we know this is wrong.

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:27.860
We know that it is wrong, naturally.

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:30.520
We don't have to have a law for it.

00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:35.520
One lady come to America with her brother and she told Me

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.610
when I had not come to America, "It's a funny place."

00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:42.860
She said, "I went to America and we wanted to stay in one room",

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:45.900
because they wanted to save some money. They said, "No. If you are brothers

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:50.860
and sisters, you can't stay." She said, "Why? I mean in India

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:53.320
if you are brother and sister you can always stay.

00:21:53.360 --> 00:22:00.940
If you are not brother and sister, then of course you can't stay, you don't stay together,

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:03.900
the other way round. If you are brother and sister

00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:07.530
you cannot stay in one room in a hotel under law.

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:12.570
And it's a father and a daughter you can't stay in one room.

00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:17.780
Absurd. I mean for us Indians it's a shock. I said, "But why?"

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:21.150
I just couldn't understand. Now I know what it is,

00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:25.190
that it has become now a law to that extent.

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:28.860
To us, it is absurd to have such a law.

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:32.520
And, as we have learned so many things from you

00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:36.780
about electricity, you also better learn from us certain thing

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:40.570
about Vishnumaya's powers.

00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:44.070
There's no harm in learning something for the roots,

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:47.150
because if the tree has gone wrong,

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:52.030
it has to learn something very much essential from the roots and that is it,

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:56.400
the purity of relationship between brothers and sisters.

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:58.610
The sister relationship

00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:07.610
always gives a very big cementing force for the husband and wife.

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:11.480
I know if My husband tries to trouble Me,

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:15.190
his own sister will be after his life.

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:20.820
And he'd better be careful about it and same with Me.

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:27.900
If I do anything wrong, My brother will side with My husband and not with Me.

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:31.360
So it cements the relationships very well.

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:37.820
In the history that I know of two very beautiful incidents I'll tell you

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:43.440
which come to My mind today is one of Shivaji.

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:49.610
When Shivaji -- it's twice it has happened in his lifetime which is very remarkable.

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:56.730
He was once presented with a lady, was very beautiful.

00:23:56.780 --> 00:24:04.570
And people had plundered her things and all her ornaments,

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:11.400
because she was a daughter of a Muslim courtesan,

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:16.730
as you call the courtier. And they tried to plunder him

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:26.030
and they brought this beautiful woman before Shivaji. So Shivaji looked at her and said,

00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:32.520
"Please remove your veil", because Muslims have a veil.

00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:40.400
And when she removed her veil, he said that, "If my mother was as beautiful as you are,

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:46.610
I would have been equally beautiful." What a thing to say - what a poetic thing to say!

00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:48.860
That is that, "If you were my mother,

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:51.820
I would have been as beautiful as you are",

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:56.360
means you are my sister.

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:58.730
And then he got very angry with all these people

00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:01.070
and he asked them that, "You'd better take her away

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:04.690
and never do such a thing to any woman." And not only,

00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:08.030
but he gave lots of ornaments and lots of things to her

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:10.780
to say that she's a sister

00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:13.860
going to the husband with all respect and regard.

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:23.110
And this gentleman, her husband, was a very deadly enemy of Shivaji.

00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:32.650
How he solved the problem with such purity and then this gentleman

00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:37.440
become sort of a milder person with this gesture of his.

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:43.150
Second in his lifetime we hear about a fort

00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:49.860
which is now very close to My house in Pune was, there was a Rajput lady

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:53.730
called Kamal Kumari, who was entrapped by the man

00:25:53.780 --> 00:26:01.400
who was the officer of that fort, who was a Muslim.

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:06.110
And he was telling this Kamal Kumari that, "You must marry me." And she would not accept.

00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:12.570
They had brought her from somewhere sort of by force. And she would not accept;

00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:18.860
she was Rajput. And he said, "By tomorrow, you'll have to marry me."

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:28.860
This lady didn't know what to do, so with someone very secretly

00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:33.360
she sent a letter to Shivaji with a rakhi.

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:40.030
But it reached the mother of Shivaji.

00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:50.070
Mother sent a letter, sent a message, to Shivaji on a horse that, "Come here as fast as possible --

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:53.360
if you're eating your food, then come here to wash your hands"

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:57.940
to that extent. And Shivaji was so obedient to his mother,

00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:02.860
very obedient. One has to learn from his character.

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:09.780
He rushed there, because obedience was his power.

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:13.480
He rushed there and asked, "Mother, what is it?"

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:17.030
She said, "No, I want to play chess with you."

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:22.150
He said, "Why now?" "I must play chess." He couldn't understand.

00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:27.780
And she played chess and she won something. She could have told him,

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:34.520
but she just wanted to sort of put a Vishnumaya on him. He lost.

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:38.070
"Mother, what do you want?" She said, "Today

00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:45.230
I want you by night to capture this fort."

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:56.230
"Today?" "Yes." Then she showed him the letter and the rakhi.

00:27:56.230 --> 00:28:00.520
Rakhi was so powerful that a mother had to ask her son,

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:04.530
who was responsible for the deliverance of Maharashtra

00:28:04.570 --> 00:28:13.570
from the clutches of the Muslims, that he should go to this fort and capture it.

00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:20.480
Such a powerful message out of that string. So. All right. Came out.

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:23.150
He was quite upset how to do it.

00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:26.280
Suddenly there was one gentleman called Tanaji,

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:30.400
he had come to invite him for his son's wedding with his uncle.

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:37.280
And he saw him so upset he said, "Why are you so upset, sir?"

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:41.780
He said, "My mother has asked me such and such thing." He said, "All right, I'm going.

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:46.070
You don't have to go, because we'll have many Tanaji's like me

00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:50.440
but we have only one Shivaji. I'm going to do it." He said, "But your son is going to marry."

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:56.070
He said, "First let my sword marry this fort,

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:59.730
then I will marry my son." Such people we had also.

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:04.900
Such sacrifice. Only on that rakhi. Think of that, only one rakhi!

00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:07.730
All right. They didn't know this girl, they didn't know her father,

00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:10.280
they didn't know anything about her, they had never seen her.

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:17.110
Can you think of somebody who will do like this in modern times?

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:20.730
We are supposed to be very evolved, powerful, great people.

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:24.940
Even in the pictures we need not show it.

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:27.520
Nobody will come to see such a film because

00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:33.530
they'll feel so low. And he went there

00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:42.360
and he used a kind of a big lizard which went and fixed the nails.

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:50.650
With a rope he climbed up and they conquered and won that fort.

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:54.610
It was decided that if they are successful they should lit fire

00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:57.480
which Shivaji can see and come down.

00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:59.400
He saw the fire early in the morning so went there.

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:03.900
And under a tree the dead body of this Tanaji was lying.

00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:11.820
He looked at it and he said, "We have got the fort but we have lost a lion."

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:15.400
That's why it's called as the Fort of the Lion, Sinhagad,

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:17.860
which you can see from My house very clearly.

00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:22.150
But these are the monuments of a small thing called a rakhi.

00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:31.940
A small symbol of expression

00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:38.860
that can capture forts after forts.

00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:46.320
Another one where -- I've told this story before but I'll repeat it today --

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:49.820
was when Alexander the Great arrested

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:56.900
one king called Puru. Alexander had married an Indian lady

00:30:56.940 --> 00:31:05.730
and the great Alexander was in jail. That was the day of Vishnumaya.

00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:13.190
So she sent -- this lady was very clever, his wife -- she sent a rakhi

00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:20.440
in a small, little thali covered nicely to the King Puru.

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:27.980
And, as the rituals are, that day this was presented to him. So he had to accept.

00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:33.030
If it is sent, you have to accept. A sister sends it with deliberations

00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:38.070
but you have to accept. And he accepted it, and it was tied.

00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:40.480
Then he said, "Who is my sister?"

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:47.230
They said, "Your sister is the wife of Alexander." Said,

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:51.520
"Oh God, that means I have arrested my own brother-in-law!"

00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:54.150
Immediately becomes a brother-in-law, immediately.

00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:56.940
No marriage took place, nothing. He's a brother-in-law.

00:31:56.980 --> 00:32:05.440
He rushed to the jail, fell flat before the great emperor.

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:09.190
He couldn't understand, "What's happening to Puru?

00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:14.190
Why did he do all this?" He said, "Sir, I am sorry", in his own language,

00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:16.940
"I'm sorry I didn't know you were my brother-in-law.

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:20.520
I'm sorry whatever I've done. Will you forgive me?" and all that.

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:27.030
And he brought him, asked him to sit on his throne.

00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:29.730
He couldn't understand, "What's this going on?"

00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:33.730
"Please." Made him sit there, garlanded him, did his aarti,

00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:41.530
gave him ornaments, gave him big garlands of diamonds and rubies and things,

00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:47.570
and touched his feet, washed his feet and then, with great honor, sent him home.

00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:49.520
He couldn't understand.

00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:52.070
"Has he gone mad or he's possessed by someone?"

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:54.900
He must have thought, "Some Greek has possessed this fellow",

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:57.570
the way he was surrendering.

00:32:57.610 --> 00:33:03.320
When he went home his wife was smiling.

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:04.820
He said, "Why are you smiling?"

00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:08.320
She said, "I knew the trick will work with Indian mind."

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:12.650
"What was the trick?" She showed him one string. "This was the trick."

00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:14.650
He couldn't understand, started looking at it.

00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:20.360
"What is this?" She said, "This is the rakhi. This is the thing I sent him.

00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:25.320
This has the symbol of a sister, that's how you're released."

00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:27.860
Alexander sat back.

00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:33.900
He said, "Oh God, these people can release their enemies on a string?

00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:37.480
I can't capture these people. They are too good.

00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:41.440
They are too subtle. These subtleties we cannot understand."

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:44.940
And he turned back. But he took some poets with him

00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:49.940
who sang his praise, how he was, what a generous man.

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:55.400
But I must say it is rather surprising to see such a subtle man in Greece.

00:33:55.440 --> 00:34:00.360
But maybe that was the time for them to understand subtleties,

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:02.570
but today I don't have much hopes.

00:34:02.610 --> 00:34:05.730
As I've seen them, they are not that subtle.

00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:12.690
They only have people like Onassis who are their heroes, whom they worship.

00:34:12.730 --> 00:34:15.980
From where to what we have come? How we have used

00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:18.940
the same good things from horrible things now.

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:22.520
How far we have gone. And I would say the same Vishnumaya

00:34:22.570 --> 00:34:25.940
has now put into this maya that you go to hell now,

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:28.980
finished. It is She Who has arranged this point.

00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:33.320
She doesn't think that Americans deserve to be in Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:38.860
It is She Who's fighting Me. She says, "Mother, forget it, forget it, forget it!"

00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:42.940
See the films -- one worse than the other.

00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:47.780
You see the recent pictures, the modern ones, you can't even see them,

00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:51.360
you have to close your eyes. The same power now

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:56.190
is for your destruction, used by you only.

00:34:56.190 --> 00:35:01.570
You are using it for your own destruction. All these films

00:35:01.610 --> 00:35:06.110
are working you out to fight each other,

00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:08.730
destroy each other, how to kill each other,

00:35:08.730 --> 00:35:12.940
how to be violent, how to be ugly, how to be shameless,

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:16.280
how to have no self-respect, and no respect for others.

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:18.730
Is all coming through these medias.

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:23.280
Your children are so rude. Nobody listens to anyone.

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:30.530
Nobody respects their elders. If somebody is a simple, honest, intelligent,

00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:35.900
brilliant man, they think he's a fool because he doesn't know how to outwit you.

00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:38.320
He doesn't know how to talk sharply,

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:41.440
because he doesn't know how to insult you all the time.

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:47.980
The whole film industry is now working out how to coin

00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:51.940
more insulting words. The more insulting words there are,

00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:55.570
the better it is. And that's what the public wants,

00:35:55.610 --> 00:35:59.530
because now it has become a economic thing

00:35:59.570 --> 00:36:06.190
to use films for economic purposes. When money becomes everything --

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:09.030
what is prostitution, you get money, what's wrong?

00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:10.860
What is wrong in destroying your family?

00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:12.690
You get money? It's all right.

00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:14.440
Now, are you going to take this money with you,

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:18.190
or are you going to leave this barbaric children on this country?

00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:22.860
What are you going to achieve? And the money orientation is so much

00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:27.520
that people say that Americans are the most miserly people,

00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:33.780
they are very self-indulgent and the most miserly people, while here it is the Vishnumaya

00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:40.690
which is the most generous thing. She burns Herself off to give you light.

00:36:40.690 --> 00:36:47.030
And the miserliness also comes with money-orientation.

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:51.030
They are also very mischievous,

00:36:51.070 --> 00:36:55.690
sometimes they try to play such tricks which are very heinous and horrible.

00:36:55.730 --> 00:37:03.520
Then electricity has to work and I don't know, I don't know about Her, how She'll work it out.

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:08.070
But She's very angry, with Americans especially,

00:37:08.110 --> 00:37:12.230
because this is the country of Her Brother.

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:17.610
This is the country where Her Brother rules, and She wants

00:37:17.650 --> 00:37:25.110
everything to be all right, because from here is generated all these nonsensical films

00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:29.820
nonsensical things which are destroying the whole world.

00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:35.780
AIDS is one of the blessings of Vishnumaya.

00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:40.150
It comes from Left Vishuddhi, people do not know.

00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:44.650
You start perspiring on the Left Vishuddhi to begin with.

00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:47.440
When people start feeling guilty,

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:53.610
they should face it  and get rid of it.

00:37:53.650 --> 00:37:57.150
Of course it starts, as you say, with right sidedness.

00:37:57.190 --> 00:38:01.900
But this right sidedness ultimately ends up into Left Vishuddhi.

00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:05.900
And then the residual part of it starts generating.

00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:11.360
This kind of a weakness in a human being,

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:17.070
because it is also the pure form of motherhood,

00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:23.480
is the Center Heart, is the pure form of motherhood.

00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:29.190
You see a child, you see a girl who is innocent. What interests her

00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:33.360
is her little dolly. She's the mother, out and out.

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:39.030
If she's properly brought up, from very childhood she's a mother.

00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:44.780
And motherhood is the epitome of womanhood.

00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:48.190
There are some Sahaja Yogis also who are so stupid

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:51.190
they don't want to have children after marriage.

00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:54.110
They should get out of Sahaja Yoga, immediately.

00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:58.190
We have not done all this to have people here

00:38:58.230 --> 00:39:01.940
who cannot produce children. If they can, they should.

00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:06.650
The reason is there are so many great souls who want to be born.

00:39:06.690 --> 00:39:12.610
These are the great fruits which are going to be prospering

00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:20.070
on the tree of your family life. And if you do not want to have any children,

00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:28.070
then what are you doing here? So the Vishnumaya's main thing

00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:36.690
is that a woman has to be a mother. Then that motherhood

00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:40.780
gives her that special capacity to shine.

00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:47.650
Now it starts with the Left Vishuddhi, the AIDS goes to the Center Heart.

00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:53.190
The Center Heart is challenged. The motherhood is lost.

00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:56.190
That's how the antibodies become weak.

00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:58.520
Once they are attacked, they become weak,

00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:03.900
they cannot fight the disease and that's how the person who gets AIDS

00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:10.480
has to face things in such a manner that it has no antibodies,

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:18.650
so he becomes allergic to everything and he dies. To fight the AIDS,

00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:25.690
the sisters' and brothers' relations must be established

00:40:25.690 --> 00:40:29.520
so that sisters can look out for men,

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:34.820
the way they are behaving, and they

00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:38.780
should look out for sisters, the way they are behaving.

00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:45.150
In this whole satanic movement I find

00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:48.190
the men become physically attacked

00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:53.360
and women become mentally attacked. And it's such an attack

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:56.730
that women are difficult to get out of it.

00:40:56.780 --> 00:41:02.610
First of all, we have to decide what is our goal

00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:06.940
is to become the Spirit, and not a sex point.

00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:11.650
This maya has changed your goals completely.

00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:19.360
It's going to make you into worms or I don't know what else.

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:23.030
Actually, this is what the Americans have to understand:

00:41:23.070 --> 00:41:27.230
where are they going? Everybody thinks that Americans

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:30.230
are half-mad if not full-mad.

00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:33.190
Any American coming into any organization,

00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:36.530
"Oh, beware, American." Americans may not know about it.

00:41:36.570 --> 00:41:41.900
They never consider an American as a completely sane person.

00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:43.650
What is the reason? Because

00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:47.360
of this queer, weird, stupid ideas they have.

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:55.940
But I heard that here the people claim that we have a fundamental right to be stupid and mad.

00:41:55.940 --> 00:42:03.820
This kind of a thing that is moving today in the country where you live,

00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:08.110
and if you have to save it, you have to turn their faces towards God.

00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:13.690
You have to turn their faces towards Self-Realization. And this is a very, very difficult task

00:42:13.730 --> 00:42:20.190
for which you all Sahaja Yogis, I request you and I pray for you,

00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:25.860
that you develop that kind of a power which is the Power of Vishnumaya

00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:28.520
that you shine with the Power of Vishnumaya.

00:42:28.530 --> 00:42:30.980
When I see your Statue of Liberty,

00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:33.440
I think she is the Vishnumaya  here standing.

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:36.610
Why didn't they make a man stand there,

00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:43.650
why a woman? She is the symbol of the Sister, of Vishnumaya,

00:42:43.650 --> 00:42:46.320
and if you have to have your liberty, have it --

00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:51.150
but liberty of wisdom, not of stupidity.

00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:57.780
And this is what I have to tell you today in this great country of Shri Krishna,

00:42:57.820 --> 00:43:02.280
that you'd better be on the lookout. Better be on the lookout.

00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:09.650
You can say that She really rules in a proper way in South America,

00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:17.690
and that was Her domain, too. And there electricity is not so prevalent.

00:43:17.730 --> 00:43:23.280
But the perversion has started because they started producing cocaine

00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:26.400
and other horrible things to spoil your Left Vishuddhi.

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:35.360
One feels guilty with one thing in the North America

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:43.110
and another one makes it bad through cocaine, and is nicely transported here

00:43:43.150 --> 00:43:52.940
for you to spoil your Vishuddhi. This is an attack on Vishnumaya,

00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:56.940
another attack on Vishnumaya from the South

00:43:56.980 --> 00:44:00.730
because they are exporting. And once I asked them,

00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:02.780
"Why do you export it?" They said,

00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:05.980
"That is their lookout to save their people; it's not our lookout."

00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:10.730
In Colombia, officially. They feel that,

00:44:10.730 --> 00:44:13.400
"If the Americans cannot look after themselves,

00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:15.480
how can we look after our people?"

00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:19.900
And they're making a big money out of you because,

00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:22.530
"You paid so much attention to money. All right, have it.

00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:27.400
We'll also have money by giving you this horrible thing

00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:30.190
to spoil your Vishuddhis and take all your money,

00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:35.070
if you think money's that important." It's something, a very big play,

00:44:35.110 --> 00:44:39.280
it's a maya, it's a horrible maya into which this country has gone into.

00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:44.900
And you have to do it by shining examples

00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:50.520
to show how starkingly it is horrid

00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:53.730
the way we accept things so easily.

00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:58.280
I'm sure this Vishnumaya will crack certain nuts here

00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:04.230
and I hope it will create a new path for Sahaja Yogis to follow,

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:06.650
to get more people into Sahaja Yoga

00:45:06.690 --> 00:45:11.070
in a proper, dynamic way and settle them in Sahaja Yoga.

00:45:11.110 --> 00:45:39.780
May God bless you.

00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:43.190
Before we start the Puja, I really admire the way

00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:46.230
you have created this maya here.

00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:52.530
I hope this will cover the blinding maya

00:45:52.570 --> 00:45:55.860
and put people into their right path.

00:45:55.900 --> 00:46:00.030
I must say I admire it, the way you have done it. It's beautifully done.

00:46:00.070 --> 00:46:02.820
May God bless you.

00:46:02.820 --> 00:47:08.150
One of the names of Devi is also Nirmala, because it means "pure",

00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:13.520
also these days people are talking of Khalsa and Khalistan.

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:18.030
Khalis means "pure." Khalistan is the place

00:47:18.070 --> 00:47:21.860
where the pure people have to settle down, that is Sahaja Yogis.

00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:28.150
That's what was said that only the Khalis people, means the people who are pure

00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:34.150
have to form Khalistan, not those who are violent or those who are stupid.

00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:39.900
Is meant for the people who are Sahaja Yogis. Was said for the Sahaja Yogis.

00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:47.230
The saints would never tell that those violent people should have their Khalistan.

00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:53.980
So, as they call it "Nirmalites" are the Khalistani people and they are the Khalsas.

00:47:53.980 --> 00:48:00.190
Such a misnomer under the influence of Vishnumaya.
