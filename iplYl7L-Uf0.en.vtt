WEBVTT

00:14.080 --> 00:17.160
in this small space.

00:17.640 --> 00:21.320
When there is love and understanding,

00:21.640 --> 00:26.840
little space can occupy many hearts.

00:26.840 --> 00:33.920
But, when there is no large heart

00:33.920 --> 00:40.920
then whatever one may get is never sufficient.

00:40.920 --> 00:46.360
Today, we are going to worship Shiva Tattva within us,

00:46.600 --> 00:50.200
principle of Shiva.

00:50.200 --> 00:56.080
For all Sahaja Yogis it's very important,

00:56.080 --> 00:59.760
because Shiva is the ultimate we have to achieve.

00:59.760 --> 01:05.440
Shiva is represented in our Spirit,

01:05.440 --> 01:14.800
so to become Shiva is the ultimate aim of everything else.

01:15.400 --> 01:18.600
The rest of it is all created,

01:18.600 --> 01:28.200
like Vishnu Tattva and Brahmadeva,

01:28.200 --> 01:32.120
just to create human beings, to evolve them

01:32.120 --> 01:40.360
and then ultimately lead them to Shiva.

01:40.360 --> 01:43.800
That's the ultimate.

01:45.800 --> 01:55.440
But human beings get so involved into the Brahmadeva's Tattva

01:55.440 --> 02:01.440
that even to get into Vishnu Tattva is difficult.

02:01.680 --> 02:07.240
They get involved into the five elements which have created

02:07.240 --> 02:10.920
that is the outermost being within us.

02:10.920 --> 02:21.240
All the chakras have the outermost, we can say just the vessel,

02:21.240 --> 02:29.400
but the desire to be the spirit

02:29.400 --> 02:36.240
is of primal importance in Sahaja Yoga.

02:36.240 --> 02:43.400
So we have to see inward towards ourselves as Sahaja Yogis,

02:43.400 --> 02:48.280
do we have that desire entirely?

02:48.280 --> 02:55.880
Or we have still many desires hanging around?

02:57.520 --> 03:02.080
See the greatest problem is of the Nabhi chakra,

03:02.080 --> 03:06.280
whether it is in the East or the West.

03:06.280 --> 03:15.600
Some people still have hankering for the baser search of food,

03:15.600 --> 03:20.800
which is very surprising, even in Sahaja Yoga,

03:21.120 --> 03:24.240
of nabhi chakra.

03:24.720 --> 03:31.640
Then, still some people have sense of possessions and money quite a lot.

03:31.640 --> 03:33.520
And subtler and subtler they grow,

03:33.520 --> 03:40.120
still the detachment doesn't develop within them.

03:42.200 --> 03:48.720
It becomes subtler. As you grow subtler,

03:48.720 --> 03:53.600
the attachment becomes subtler and difficult to get out,

03:53.600 --> 03:57.200
specially people who come up as leaders in Sahaja Yoga

03:57.200 --> 04:00.400
or closer to Sahaja Yoga

04:00.400 --> 04:03.560
are always under attack.

04:03.560 --> 04:06.520
They are attacked

04:06.520 --> 04:09.080
maybe by their husbands, wives,

04:09.080 --> 04:14.880
brothers, sisters, sons, children, something like that.

04:14.880 --> 04:22.920
And that makes it worse

04:22.920 --> 04:28.880
because all such leaders who are attacked

04:28.880 --> 04:37.520
try to displease all the deities by small things here and there.

04:37.520 --> 04:42.760
The whole behaviour has to be understood

04:42.760 --> 04:47.120
that you have become a subtler person

04:47.120 --> 04:49.080
and you are rising higher,

04:49.080 --> 04:54.240
so naturally the negative forces are going to attack you.

04:54.240 --> 04:57.840
Always the front line is under attack,

04:57.840 --> 05:00.440
not the back line.

05:00.440 --> 05:06.200
So those who are in the front are always under attack

05:06.200 --> 05:08.640
and they have to be very careful

05:08.640 --> 05:11.280
as to how they are behaving.

05:11.280 --> 05:13.360
For if there is a sly person,

05:13.360 --> 05:16.800
he will become sly, but subtler sly.

05:16.800 --> 05:19.840
He will not just become the other way round.

05:19.840 --> 05:22.280
His slyness will become subtler.

05:22.280 --> 05:29.120
If he is a miserly fellow, then he will become miserly in a subtler way.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.640
Or say, if he is an ego-oriented fellow,

05:31.640 --> 05:35.040
then he becomes ego-oriented in a subtler way.

05:35.040 --> 05:41.920
But to get rid of these things within you,

05:41.920 --> 05:44.520
you have to go to the other side of it.

05:44.520 --> 05:46.680
Say if you are miserly, you become absolutely generous,

05:46.680 --> 05:50.400
give up everything that you have.

05:50.400 --> 05:52.520
Don't be calculating,

05:52.520 --> 05:57.760
don't talk of money, don't worry about money.

05:57.760 --> 06:00.040
If you are extravagant, indulgent too much,

06:00.040 --> 06:04.480
you should go the other way round.

06:04.480 --> 06:08.240
Unless and until you become juxtaposition,

06:08.240 --> 06:10.720
you cannot get rid of these things.

06:10.720 --> 06:12.440
Like if you are hot-tempered man, very hot-tempered,

06:12.440 --> 06:14.560
then become so mild

06:14.560 --> 06:18.560
that even if somebody beats you, it's all right.

06:18.560 --> 06:20.520
Whatever one says it's all right.

06:20.520 --> 06:27.600
That's how you get rid of your habits which become subtler and subtler.

06:27.880 --> 06:36.280
There's another way of dealing with it, being alert.

06:36.280 --> 06:38.680
When you are alert, you start seeing yourself

06:38.680 --> 06:42.200
as a separate person with the habits that it has,

06:42.200 --> 06:45.640
and then you start understanding why you are behaving. Oh I understand,

06:45.640 --> 06:49.920
I knew you before, ten years back, before my realization.

06:49.920 --> 06:52.080
I know mister, you are like this,

06:52.080 --> 06:57.920
and then take the juxtaposition against that personality

06:57.920 --> 07:01.040
and just shoot it off.

07:01.040 --> 07:04.760
Like a person who is a negative, left-sided person.

07:04.760 --> 07:06.280
Whatever you may do for that person,

07:06.280 --> 07:08.200
he will become subtler and subtler.

07:08.200 --> 07:10.560
Suddenly, if it's a girl,

07:10.560 --> 07:14.640
she will start just crying for nothing at all and feeling miserable.

07:14.640 --> 07:18.440
If it's a boy, if he thinks about, analyses

07:18.440 --> 07:25.360
he will become analyzer of Sahaja Yoga, in a subtler way.

07:25.360 --> 07:28.080
Then what they should do is to stand before the photograph

07:28.080 --> 07:32.920
and see the reflection, that's the other one who died.

07:32.920 --> 07:36.040
And just try to make fun of that

07:36.040 --> 07:41.760
or shout at it, depends on.

07:41.760 --> 07:44.320
If it is an aggressive stuff,

07:44.320 --> 07:47.520
it's better to make fun, because it's stupid.

07:47.520 --> 07:52.120
And if it is the one who takes aggression, then shout at it,

07:52.120 --> 07:56.040
what do you mean, by taking aggression like this.

07:56.040 --> 08:01.680
All these things, you see, are keeping you away from reality.

08:01.680 --> 08:03.520
Your being has to be cleansed.

08:03.520 --> 08:07.520
With your help only I can do it.

08:07.520 --> 08:09.760
Many people say, "Mother, You are all powerful."

08:09.760 --> 08:13.440
All right, I am and I can do everything.

08:13.440 --> 08:19.040
But only thing I cannot surpass 'your' freedom. That's a fact.

08:19.040 --> 08:23.600
I cannot cross over your freedom.

08:24.360 --> 08:32.080
And when I cannot cross your freedom, 'you' have to cross that.

08:32.080 --> 08:34.800
If in your own freedom, you come inside,

08:34.800 --> 08:37.840
then I will bestow upon you all the blessings.

08:37.840 --> 08:40.080
But if you want to stand outside

08:40.080 --> 08:43.680
I am not the one to put you inside with a pistol.

08:43.680 --> 08:47.400
No, that's not the way it will work out.

08:47.400 --> 08:51.120
This is one hurdle that Sahaja Yogis must know

08:51.120 --> 08:57.360
that at every moment you are free, and freer, and freest.

08:57.680 --> 09:00.760
The more free you become, the worse is your situation

09:00.760 --> 09:03.920
as far as the facing of the negativity is concerned.

09:03.920 --> 09:09.760
Say there are four persons around you.

09:09.760 --> 09:12.880
They will be first attacked.

09:12.880 --> 09:16.920
Naturally you can understand the front line is always under attack,

09:16.920 --> 09:19.120
not the back side.

09:19.120 --> 09:21.840
Though according to the law, it should be the back side

09:21.840 --> 09:26.120
because all these horrible negative forces should come from the back.

09:26.120 --> 09:28.360
But they are very clever.

09:28.360 --> 09:31.200
They know that the back sometimes drop off by themselves;

09:31.200 --> 09:35.920
there is no need to go that side. They try the front line.

09:35.920 --> 09:40.480
And those who think they are in charge and responsible

09:40.480 --> 09:44.280
have to be very careful as to how they behave,

09:44.280 --> 09:47.800
how they are responsible, how they work it out.

09:47.800 --> 09:50.080
If they are keeping their old habits

09:50.080 --> 09:54.760
at a subtler level or they are just fighting it. It's very important.

09:54.760 --> 10:00.600
And this is how intelligently you can manage yourselves.

10:00.600 --> 10:06.320
Then once you become detached,

10:06.320 --> 10:11.080
go from all these things, only at mental level.

10:11.080 --> 10:13.040
The spiritual level I'll look after you.

10:13.040 --> 10:17.320
At mental level, you must come to logical conclusion that

10:17.320 --> 10:20.240
"I have to fight this nonsensical stuff.

10:20.240 --> 10:26.560
I have to be alert about this nonsense that exists within me."

10:34.440 --> 10:38.800
Shiva Tattva is innocent, absolutely innocent it is.

10:38.800 --> 10:43.080
It is very powerful and extremely innocent.

10:43.080 --> 10:47.840
And the secret to achieve it is only just to please, just please.

10:47.840 --> 10:52.320
If you please Shiva, then you may be a rakshasa or anything,

10:52.320 --> 10:56.120
He grants all kinds of boons.

10:56.120 --> 11:04.920
But to a rakshasa He can only grant the boon of longevity, of long life.

11:04.920 --> 11:13.760
But to a saint, He'll grant the Satchitananda state.

11:14.320 --> 11:20.520
So even if He grants anything to a rakshasa,

11:20.520 --> 11:23.840
one should not ask questions about it.

11:23.840 --> 11:25.440
He can give you longevity - what does it matter,

11:25.440 --> 11:31.360
even if he lives for thousands of years and earn nothing out of it;

11:31.360 --> 11:33.760
he'll never get your realization.

11:33.760 --> 11:40.720
So to a saint, He gives that eternal longevity

11:40.720 --> 11:44.480
which comes through Spirit.

11:44.480 --> 11:49.520
This is the blessing of Shiva Tattva.

11:49.520 --> 12:02.520
While Vishnu Tattva, He gives ascent to a saint

12:02.520 --> 12:09.360
and light of wisdom to see

12:09.360 --> 12:15.400
and understand everything in collective consciousness

12:15.400 --> 12:24.120
and to a rakshasa He gives death, He kills.

12:24.120 --> 12:33.560
So for people who are not so deep,

12:33.560 --> 12:38.160
it seems that why should Shiva give any blessings of longevity

12:38.480 --> 12:41.560
to a rakshasa.

12:41.560 --> 12:50.160
These are the characters of these different deities.

12:50.160 --> 12:58.680
Now for example, if a rakshasa wants to live long,

12:58.680 --> 13:03.480
he goes to Shiva, pleases Him

13:03.480 --> 13:09.280
by praising Him, singing songs to Him, by asking His blessings,

13:09.280 --> 13:14.440
by doing tapas for Him, talking about Shiva's innocence

13:14.440 --> 13:17.800
he gets longevity.

13:17.800 --> 13:20.240
Sometimes,

13:20.240 --> 13:24.920
these rakshasas are better on the earth than in the subconscious.

13:24.920 --> 13:27.160
They can be horrid.

13:27.160 --> 13:29.720
They can gather some more bhoots

13:29.720 --> 13:32.240
to torture human beings.

13:32.240 --> 13:37.480
So it's better to keep them in the eyes of Vishnu.

13:37.480 --> 13:46.600
He manages them better here than to send them into the subconscious.

13:46.600 --> 13:51.480
But Shiva's style is very different from that of Vishnu's style.

13:51.480 --> 13:52.920
You have to have all kinds of styles

13:52.920 --> 13:56.240
because you know there are so many permutations and combinations

13:56.240 --> 13:57.800
in human beings.

13:57.800 --> 13:59.400
If you have one style,

13:59.400 --> 14:02.600
what will you do with the other style of human beings?

14:02.600 --> 14:07.840
So the style of Vishnu is

14:07.840 --> 14:10.640
that if you are trying to be funny,

14:10.640 --> 14:17.800
He plays tricks and puts you right.

14:17.800 --> 14:19.760
Say, a Sahaja Yogi

14:19.760 --> 14:22.200
He is not interested - Vishnu - so much interested in other people,

14:22.200 --> 14:27.560
but in Sahaja Yogis. If Sahaja Yogi tries to be funny;

14:27.560 --> 14:33.640
say he wants to drink wine, all right, He says, "Drink wine."

14:33.640 --> 14:37.320
He drinks the wine, and then he gets sick somewhere,

14:37.320 --> 14:41.640
his cars falls off, or he is insulted somewhere.

14:41.640 --> 14:43.840
Something happens to him, he is punished so badly

14:43.840 --> 14:49.600
that he says, "Oh God, what have I done?" That's Vishnu tattva.

14:49.600 --> 14:52.080
But Shiva is the other way round.

14:52.080 --> 14:58.920
If you see Shiva's style is this; that if you drink,

14:58.920 --> 15:02.240
He just disappears from your heart.

15:02.840 --> 15:07.040
You have a heart attack and you die.

15:07.040 --> 15:08.640
He also kills.

15:08.640 --> 15:14.360
One kills directly in a positive way, He definitely kills;

15:14.360 --> 15:19.720
the another one by recession. If Shiva disappears, how can you exist,

15:19.720 --> 15:23.400
that's one way. Second way is that,

15:23.400 --> 15:25.720
those who are born with Shiva tattva

15:25.720 --> 15:30.480
like our Sainath was - Shirdi Sainath,

15:30.480 --> 15:31.920
or people like that;

15:31.920 --> 15:35.680
even the Devis sometimes can do that.

15:35.680 --> 15:40.240
They drink away all the wines of the world, all the poisons of the world.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.640
Like Shiva did that.

15:42.640 --> 15:49.680
So when Sainath found that so many people were smoking this tobacco,

15:49.680 --> 15:52.760
he smoked all the tobacco of the world.

15:52.760 --> 15:57.920
He tried to smoke everything in Maharashtra so that nobody should get it.

15:57.920 --> 16:02.760
That's the style of Shiva to take all the poison into Himself.

16:02.760 --> 16:07.280
And to absorb all the poison within Himself.

16:07.280 --> 16:10.200
He can deal with the most difficult things;

16:10.200 --> 16:14.200
so the one dealing comes through the brain.

16:14.200 --> 16:19.480
Because Virata is in our brain, acts through the brain.

16:19.480 --> 16:22.200
So He plays tricks on you.

16:22.200 --> 16:26.800
And that appeals to us because we can see that He's killed someone.

16:26.800 --> 16:30.200
So we think 'very nice Mother, You have punished that person'.

16:30.200 --> 16:34.360
But Shiva Tattva gives you the problems

16:35.800 --> 16:42.520
which normally you cannot see, but works out in a short time like that.

16:42.520 --> 16:45.440
Like heart troubles

16:45.440 --> 16:52.600
or a person who has a very poor Shiva Tattva

16:52.600 --> 16:58.520
can have all the incurable diseases of the world.

16:58.520 --> 17:06.440
There nobody is killed, but every minute the person is suffering.

17:06.440 --> 17:10.520
That is the way Shiva corrects.

17:10.520 --> 17:14.440
In us when Shiva Tattva is awakened

17:14.440 --> 17:18.440
our priorities change absolutely.

17:18.440 --> 17:22.360
I see now that those who have come, say,

17:22.360 --> 17:25.120
to India from the west

17:25.120 --> 17:29.880
have changed quite a lot in their priorities, but still

17:29.880 --> 17:33.800
there is not so much change as it should be.

17:33.800 --> 17:36.080
They're of course thousand times better

17:36.080 --> 17:39.880
than their fellow beings who are not realized souls.

17:39.880 --> 17:46.400
But still, attachment to things, attachment to money is quite a lot.

17:46.400 --> 17:49.760
This detachment must work out.

17:49.760 --> 17:55.680
See things are not correct in people and the alertness is not there.

17:55.680 --> 18:00.240
To give a very, very gross example of this, I will tell you that,

18:00.240 --> 18:08.080
a gentleman, say, came and he was told that you have to give,

18:08.080 --> 18:10.720
say, eleven rupees for puja. He said,

18:10.720 --> 18:14.680
"On principle we are not supposed to give."

18:14.680 --> 18:18.840
So I mean, you are only paying even on principle

18:18.840 --> 18:24.280
you are only paying for your food and lodging, not for puja.

18:24.280 --> 18:26.840
The other side of it they will not even see

18:26.840 --> 18:31.840
that Mother is spending so much for us extra for which we are not paying.

18:31.840 --> 18:38.280
It's not all found. Like the other day, I said

18:38.280 --> 18:41.040
that people are now asking Me to pay for this,

18:41.040 --> 18:45.880
then tomorrow they will say pay for our house rents. It was so.

18:45.880 --> 18:49.840
It was such a condition, once upon a time in London when I started the ashram.

18:49.840 --> 18:51.920
That they asked for all the utensils in the ashram,

18:51.920 --> 18:54.920
I paid for the rent, paid for everything.

18:54.920 --> 18:58.920
Ultimately they said we don't have an ironing board, please send us.

18:58.920 --> 19:05.360
From that, it's not so bad now, I mean, of course.

19:05.680 --> 19:09.320
But still, if they have to pay 5 rupees for taxi,

19:09.320 --> 19:12.640
they will think that, "Oh we have to pay for taxi - Mother is supposed to pay."

19:12.640 --> 19:13.960
But if I pay

19:13.960 --> 19:17.680
7000- 8000 rupees for you to go to Haridwar, that's all right.

19:17.680 --> 19:24.400
That's good. That nobody wants to find out, how Mother is paying for us.

19:26.480 --> 19:30.560
It's surprising and this disturbs Me very much

19:30.560 --> 19:36.840
that what is your attitude towards that.

19:37.800 --> 19:42.280
The pleasing should be done with full heart.

19:42.280 --> 19:46.640
Say if you have to buy any presents for your friends, or anything,

19:46.640 --> 19:49.280
you don't mind spending money for that.

19:49.280 --> 19:51.600
But for puja you have objections.

19:51.600 --> 19:54.880
For your laundry you used to pay always, I mean

19:54.880 --> 19:58.360
I have seen the laundry bill, I was amazed how much money was spent.

19:58.360 --> 20:02.680
But 21 Rupees, the principle was involved,

20:02.680 --> 20:05.560
imagine. Look at it.

20:05.560 --> 20:09.440
If you look at it, you will be shocked at yourselves.

20:09.440 --> 20:14.920
That shows despite all this, you have got your realization.

20:14.920 --> 20:20.360
See the generosity. It's very, very - you see, it's very gross.

20:20.360 --> 20:23.280
It's very gross.

20:23.520 --> 20:30.520
So the detachment from this gross life must go away.

20:30.800 --> 20:35.240
But an ordinary villager understands better because he is innocent.

20:35.240 --> 20:37.560
He is innocent. Because you are not innocent.

20:37.560 --> 20:40.080
That's why you see everything from your mind.

20:40.080 --> 20:41.520
You think about it.

20:41.520 --> 20:46.560
How much have we paid, how much this is, this that, this that.

20:46.560 --> 20:51.800
But an innocent villager even if he has four annas,

20:51.800 --> 20:54.040
he would like to do something,

20:54.040 --> 20:57.080
"Mother - that's all I have."

20:57.080 --> 21:01.920
We have a parable in the Bible.

21:01.920 --> 21:05.280
And this is what it is. One should see our detachment starts

21:05.280 --> 21:12.280
at a very baser level of money.

21:12.280 --> 21:13.880
You need not have any friends,

21:13.880 --> 21:20.880
what is the need to give  to any friends?

21:20.880 --> 21:24.520
What are these friends for?

21:24.520 --> 21:28.600
Except for Shiva Tattva, what other friend you need?

21:28.600 --> 21:35.800
Think of it, without God, what is your life?

21:35.800 --> 21:39.160
So the detachment must start. The priorities must change

21:39.160 --> 21:43.920
and you must know that God is the One who is your Friend,

21:43.920 --> 21:46.520
who is your Father, who is your Mother,

21:46.520 --> 21:50.800
who is to be worshipped, there is nothing else.

21:50.800 --> 21:53.520
Tana, mana, dhana, everything is for God.

21:53.520 --> 21:56.600
Of course, I don't want anything from you, you know that.

21:56.600 --> 22:02.200
But that should be the attitude of a person.

22:06.320 --> 22:12.920
So the first - this attitude comes in a person.

22:12.920 --> 22:16.560
Of course, in Sahaja Yoga, you have a great advantage

22:16.560 --> 22:19.160
that those who have developed this attitude

22:19.160 --> 22:22.320
have been helped so much materially

22:22.320 --> 22:27.920
that you find the proof of it immediately.

22:27.920 --> 22:31.800
The proof is there and those who do not take to this kind of a thing

22:31.800 --> 22:37.120
suffer. So the proof is there.

22:37.120 --> 22:47.760
I must give you an example of a - goldsmith.

22:47.760 --> 22:51.560
I had given him something to be made for the Puja.

22:51.560 --> 22:54.280
A lot of gold was given, everything.

22:54.280 --> 23:01.040
And still, stupidly, he tried to make money out of that.

23:01.040 --> 23:04.440
And he got cancer and he died.

23:04.440 --> 23:10.440
I didn't do anything. But I knew he had made money, I knew that all.

23:10.440 --> 23:16.160
I knew lots of things, I didn't say anything to him, nothing, never

23:16.160 --> 23:25.040
never even mentioned. He got cancer and he died, he is no more.

23:25.040 --> 23:28.440
Because Shiva Tattva disappeared.

23:28.440 --> 23:34.760
This was for a puja, the money of the saints,

23:34.760 --> 23:38.800
something was to be made and he should not have done it.

23:38.800 --> 23:40.400
The proof is just there.

23:40.400 --> 23:43.040
Now, those who knew him got a fright of their lives,

23:43.040 --> 23:47.400
"Oh God, now no more of this from us at least."

23:52.400 --> 23:57.080
But those who have been surrendered about their money part also,

23:57.080 --> 24:01.440
not that I take anything from them nor I want anything from you.

24:01.440 --> 24:04.840
But, still the attitude I am saying is different,

24:04.840 --> 24:06.800
they have gone out, they have made money,

24:06.800 --> 24:10.480
they are very rich, they are very well to do, they are all right.

24:10.480 --> 24:15.560
They get so much blessings - everything.

24:15.560 --> 24:23.120
This is the first Nabhi chakra. We should start by putting Shiva.

24:26.040 --> 24:31.560
Every attachment can be attacked with Shiva Tattva

24:31.560 --> 24:36.920
because Shiva Tattva is brilliant like a diamond, brilliant.

24:36.920 --> 24:41.120
Every facet can be cleansed out, very simply

24:41.120 --> 24:45.600
through our Kundalini awakening and through our alertness

24:45.600 --> 24:52.040
and what after that you can see there are other attachments we have.

24:52.040 --> 24:57.920
This is friendship, sympathies, friendships.

24:57.920 --> 25:01.720
Sympathies always go to a person

25:01.720 --> 25:04.440
who is in need or something like that.

25:04.440 --> 25:08.920
You have no sympathies, have tortured so many people.

25:08.920 --> 25:12.880
The other way also could be that you hate someone too much,

25:12.880 --> 25:16.840
you love someone too much, some sort of a thing like that.

25:16.840 --> 25:22.760
So detachment comes that you do not hate nor you love anyone.

25:22.760 --> 25:25.600
You leave it to God.

25:31.160 --> 25:33.680
That's the kind of a detachment that you leave it to God.

25:33.680 --> 25:37.640
God, please that's His decision. I am not going to judge.

25:37.640 --> 25:41.920
Only thing I judge them on Kundalini and I awaken their kundalini.

25:41.920 --> 25:44.240
If it works out well and good, if it doesn't work out, all right.

25:44.240 --> 25:46.800
So we have detached yourselves,

25:46.800 --> 25:50.400
from the responsibility of judging others.

25:50.400 --> 25:54.560
Only your judgment is on Kundalini, if it works out, all right.

25:54.560 --> 25:57.440
But, you are just like a barometer that's all,

25:57.440 --> 26:02.080
or like a machine that cures. You are not involved into it.

26:02.080 --> 26:06.320
So this involvement into personal lives and personal relationships

26:06.320 --> 26:09.280
like mother, sister, brother every sort of a nonsense

26:09.280 --> 26:11.280
must be taken up.

26:11.280 --> 26:15.120
Now say, if your mother is not all right,

26:16.400 --> 26:20.760
you must just get after her and see that she is put right.

26:20.760 --> 26:23.920
That's very important; mother has to be all right.

26:23.920 --> 26:25.080
If she's not all right,

26:25.080 --> 26:28.200
then you tell her, "I'm not going to eat food from your hand", finished.

26:28.200 --> 26:31.320
You get your vibrations, all right.

26:31.320 --> 26:35.920
You tell her that "You better take to realization otherwise

26:35.920 --> 26:40.160
I will not have anything to do with you. I'm just going to see,

26:40.160 --> 26:42.400
talk to you and go away."

26:42.400 --> 26:44.440
Show that detachment to her. Be strong.

26:44.440 --> 26:46.440
You must cure your mother. Very important

26:46.440 --> 26:49.840
because mother is a part of Sahaja Yoga,

26:49.840 --> 26:54.080
it's very important. But many people I have seen

26:54.080 --> 26:57.600
just do not know how to resist. You must protest;

26:57.600 --> 27:00.280
go on protesting one after another

27:00.280 --> 27:05.320
because that's the greatest thing you are doing for your mother.

27:05.320 --> 27:07.560
What else can you give it to her?

27:07.560 --> 27:11.400
Anything you give the whole world has no meaning

27:11.400 --> 27:15.400
except correcting your mother for a better life,

27:15.400 --> 27:19.840
an eternal life, life of God.

27:25.360 --> 27:26.840
Then your wife

27:26.840 --> 27:29.240
your wife is a very dangerous situation.

27:29.240 --> 27:33.120
If your wife is negative, she will go on

27:33.120 --> 27:37.480
putting into your head things which will work out at a odd time

27:37.480 --> 27:40.440
and you will be amazed how you slipped out

27:40.440 --> 27:43.880
these things and how you said these things. Why should you have done it

27:43.880 --> 27:46.080
why did you do this.

27:46.080 --> 27:48.240
But the wife is to be told that,

27:48.240 --> 27:50.440
"You have to behave yourself; you have to get all right,

27:50.440 --> 27:54.320
nothing doing. And there is no compromise.

27:54.320 --> 27:56.440
You be in another room, I will be in another room.

27:56.440 --> 27:58.520
You should get well. I am not going to help."

27:58.520 --> 28:01.440
Because that is even much more dangerous

28:01.440 --> 28:05.920
because you know if the woman is catching

28:05.920 --> 28:12.920
then there are very serious diseases developed in the Mooladhara.

28:12.920 --> 28:15.040
So you have to be strict with your wife.

28:15.040 --> 28:17.360
You should make her, you should tell her,

28:17.360 --> 28:19.120
"I'll not eat any food with your hands.

28:19.120 --> 28:22.440
I'll have nothing to do, I'll not talk to you,

28:22.440 --> 28:25.360
I'll just come and sleep in another room.

28:25.360 --> 28:29.640
You better not touch my clothes.

28:29.640 --> 28:33.800
If you don't listen to me then I have nothing to do with you

28:34.040 --> 28:37.480
or better I'm your husband.

28:37.480 --> 28:39.840
Whatever dharma I follow you have to follow me,

28:39.840 --> 28:43.120
if you don't want to listen to me, then I have nothing to do with you."

28:43.120 --> 28:46.080
The wife can also do the same with the husband.

28:46.080 --> 28:48.440
Gradually showing indifference

28:48.440 --> 28:52.800
in a way that he understands that it doesn't bring love.

28:52.800 --> 28:56.800
That's how women corrected men long time back.

28:56.800 --> 29:00.600
Nowadays, of course women, if you give them something,

29:00.600 --> 29:01.800
they are get pleased.

29:01.800 --> 29:03.240
Even if there is a keep,

29:03.240 --> 29:05.880
as long as they are giving diamonds to the wife

29:05.880 --> 29:08.480
she is quite pleased with the keep.

29:08.480 --> 29:10.800
Still in India it's not accepted.

29:10.800 --> 29:13.280
But I have seen in the west nobody minds,

29:13.280 --> 29:15.520
if the husband has ten keeps doesn't matter

29:15.520 --> 29:20.440
as long as he is giving you the money, all right, nobody minds it.

29:20.440 --> 29:24.320
That's very funny.

29:24.320 --> 29:29.880
So wife's relation, mother's relation, husband's relations,

29:29.880 --> 29:33.160
close relations must be corrected.

29:33.160 --> 29:35.520
Now children must be guarded.

29:35.520 --> 29:39.600
You shouldn't allow your children to go away to the wrong things.

29:39.600 --> 29:42.360
If they are doing wrong things, they are not coming to Sahaja Yoga,

29:42.360 --> 29:43.920
you are duty bound;

29:43.920 --> 29:46.600
you should say, I'm not going to pay you any money, nothing doing.

29:46.600 --> 29:51.720
I'll not see your faces, if you do not take to Sahaja Yoga.

29:51.720 --> 29:57.480
What else are you going to give to your children, but God?

30:00.520 --> 30:08.200
You can do it. All can do it.

30:08.720 --> 30:14.320
But one should know 'I' need not do it.

30:14.320 --> 30:15.600
So many people say

30:15.600 --> 30:19.080
that, "Mother, Your husband is not so much a Sahaja Yogi."

30:19.080 --> 30:22.120
It's all right. I know where to bring him in;

30:22.120 --> 30:24.520
I know when to bring My children in;

30:24.520 --> 30:27.280
because if they were in everybody would have said,

30:27.280 --> 30:33.560
"They have floated a family enterprise."

30:38.720 --> 30:41.520
As long as they are out of it, it's a very good idea

30:41.520 --> 30:44.200
specially in India.

30:45.360 --> 30:48.480
So best thing is if they oppose Me, I keep all of them out,

30:48.480 --> 30:54.080
My brothers. Imagine My own brothers, My own - I mean,

30:54.080 --> 30:58.080
they all have tremendous respect for Me, no doubt.

30:58.080 --> 31:01.840
Even My brothers said that, "Thank God You are staying in my room now,

31:01.840 --> 31:05.240
so the vibrations will be very good for me.

31:05.240 --> 31:06.920
What do You think of my vibrations?"

31:06.920 --> 31:09.680
Everything he says, but he is not a Sahaja Yogi.

31:09.680 --> 31:12.360
I have given realization to all of them, everything is there,

31:12.360 --> 31:14.640
but they are not Sahaja Yogis - apart of this.

31:14.640 --> 31:18.360
Otherwise they will be in charge of money, you see.

31:18.360 --> 31:20.440
What money you get. Now come along

31:20.440 --> 31:25.040
this is the money we have, all problems.

31:25.040 --> 31:27.640
With all these relations around, you don't know.

31:27.640 --> 31:30.040
Somebody will go and say, "Shri Mataji said so."

31:30.040 --> 31:34.280
"Oh, that's the daughter of Mataji  has said so." - That becomes so.

31:34.280 --> 31:39.440
I don't want all these pressures on My head.

31:39.440 --> 31:43.560
That's the best way; I wish our politicians understand that;

31:43.560 --> 31:46.320
never have your relations around.

31:46.320 --> 31:49.160
That's the best way to administer.

31:49.160 --> 31:52.720
If you have your relations around,

31:52.720 --> 31:54.920
then you will never do right things.

31:54.920 --> 32:01.040
Or even if you do right things, your relations will spoil it.

32:01.040 --> 32:04.320
So all those who are Sahaja Yogis must know

32:04.320 --> 32:08.160
that you should not try to help your relations

32:08.160 --> 32:13.200
in a way that they take advantage of Sahaja Yoga.

32:13.200 --> 32:16.280
Like, if you are a Sahaja Yogi,

32:16.280 --> 32:21.680
then you bring your mother and make her sit in front of Me.

32:21.680 --> 32:25.320
First correct her vibrations,

32:25.320 --> 32:31.240
put her right and then bring her.

32:31.240 --> 32:35.200
Correct my father, correct my mother is not Mother's responsibility,

32:35.200 --> 32:37.680
it's your own.

32:37.680 --> 32:41.240
When they are all right, then as you bring flowers to Me,

32:41.240 --> 32:48.440
bring your relations as a very good present from your family.

32:48.440 --> 32:53.080
That's a much better thing than to be like this that

32:53.080 --> 32:56.440
I have to clear. If one is a Sahaja Yogi,

32:56.440 --> 32:58.920
all his three generations up and down,

32:58.920 --> 33:02.880
this side and that side have to cure that is done.

33:02.880 --> 33:08.920
Like Malhotra made Me do.

33:08.920 --> 33:12.640
So one should detach from these family ties

33:12.640 --> 33:18.040
and these emotional imbalances we have, emotional problems we have

33:18.040 --> 33:22.440
by understanding that the only thing that these people should have

33:22.440 --> 33:26.560
is Sahaja Yoga.

33:26.560 --> 33:29.480
And some people should not be in Sahaja Yoga

33:29.480 --> 33:33.560
like as I said - My own husband, and My daughter and My relations,

33:33.560 --> 33:36.520
I'll keep them out.

33:36.520 --> 33:39.440
All such people if there are any,

33:39.440 --> 33:41.840
you should not also have them anywhere near Sahaja Yoga.

33:41.840 --> 33:47.320
You should be discrete to find out.

33:47.320 --> 33:50.720
Although, all these, My relations are very dharmic people,

33:50.720 --> 33:53.240
extremely dharmic, very good.

33:53.240 --> 33:56.400
Very self-respecting, all qualities they have got - everything.

33:56.400 --> 34:02.240
Ready made, but they are not in Sahaja Yoga.

34:02.240 --> 34:06.240
So none of you can say so-body said so, so one said so.

34:06.240 --> 34:13.120
It has to be Mother has to say.

34:13.120 --> 34:16.120
This detachment has to come, it takes time.

34:16.120 --> 34:17.400
Especially with Indians,

34:17.400 --> 34:20.840
all the time they are worried about their children, mother or father

34:20.840 --> 34:23.680
on and on and on and on and on.

34:23.680 --> 34:28.240
See years together, my son, my daughter, my son, my father –

34:28.720 --> 34:30.840
all the time.

34:30.840 --> 34:32.880
Now by God's grace

34:32.880 --> 34:36.800
so many have got rid of all their responsibilities somehow,

34:36.800 --> 34:38.880
through Sahaja Yoga, or whatever it is,

34:38.880 --> 34:41.440
so they are now they have settled down with themselves,

34:41.440 --> 34:44.160
because you have your own responsibility.

34:44.160 --> 34:48.520
So this detachment must be brought those who are coming to Sahaja Yoga,

34:48.520 --> 34:53.120
that we are here to get Sahaja Yoga blessings.

34:53.120 --> 34:55.480
We are going to be blessings, with that pride.

34:55.480 --> 34:58.040
You should be in the family, all right.

34:58.040 --> 35:00.440
If you want to have Sahaja Yoga, you have it.

35:00.440 --> 35:03.360
But not to force them on Sahaja Yoga,

35:03.360 --> 35:06.040
but you can force Sahaja Yoga on them,

35:06.040 --> 35:08.040
the stage has come that you have to talk about Sahaja Yoga to them.

35:08.040 --> 35:10.480
In the beginning I used to say, "Don't talk to them."

35:10.480 --> 35:13.320
But those who are useless, if they are not to be brought in Sahaja Yoga,

35:13.320 --> 35:16.280
tell them, "You are not good for Sahaja Yoga, better not ask."

35:16.280 --> 35:18.400
Then they will come.

35:18.400 --> 35:20.520
Some people you should show complete indifference,

35:20.520 --> 35:23.440
"you are incapable, you are no good, you are too materialistic."

35:23.440 --> 35:31.080
Then that person would say, "I will prove that I am"

35:35.760 --> 35:39.880
All these detachments take place

35:39.880 --> 35:45.680
and then the detachments are at Nabhi chakras,

35:45.680 --> 35:49.280
will rise up to your emotional side in your Heart chakra.

35:49.280 --> 35:55.920
And then you have to have the detachment even of a

35:55.920 --> 36:00.680
kind of a collectivity that we think is collectivity.

36:00.680 --> 36:07.640
I call the fraternity of the bhoots, not collectivity.

36:07.640 --> 36:14.440
Always all the useless Sahaja Yogis will form a group

36:14.440 --> 36:21.800
and they will have a very strong objection

36:21.800 --> 36:25.720
to everything that is sensible.

36:25.720 --> 36:28.480
And they will have suggestions for everything.

36:28.480 --> 36:35.280
There has to be no suggestions at all.

36:35.280 --> 36:40.600
There are no alternatives, because Shiva is absolute.

36:40.600 --> 36:47.080
Once what is said is said, you just do it and see - that's the best.

36:47.080 --> 36:53.760
Alternatives will be second best or third best or maybe useless.

36:53.760 --> 37:00.840
But there is no alternative for Shiva Tattva.

37:00.840 --> 37:06.520
I'll give an example, I told Delhi people that you organise say,

37:06.520 --> 37:10.920
program for seven days outside with other people.

37:10.920 --> 37:15.440
It was sensible because I knew it was to rain. It has to rain also.

37:15.440 --> 37:19.040
Rain can be stopped, but it was to rain for all the other villagers, you see.

37:19.040 --> 37:21.280
We cannot stop it only for Sahaja Yogis.

37:22.920 --> 37:24.840
Of course, Sahaja Yogis are important so I said,

37:24.840 --> 37:27.640
"Let them be with other Sahaja Yogis."

37:27.640 --> 37:30.200
Now they started an alternative, only thinking,

37:30.200 --> 37:35.120
that you see they won't be comfortable. And I mean it was good,

37:35.120 --> 37:38.840
but on a other level that they will not be comfortable

37:38.840 --> 37:41.040
with Sahaja Yogis, another level.

37:41.040 --> 37:43.720
But there has to be understanding if Mother has said it

37:43.720 --> 37:45.720
it must be done - whatever it is.

37:45.720 --> 37:49.520
Even if She says, "You kill somebody", you have to kill.

37:49.520 --> 37:51.920
Keep it like that to that extent.

37:51.920 --> 37:55.680
Keep to the maximum,

37:55.680 --> 38:00.840
Even if She says, "You have to die", you should die.

38:00.840 --> 38:07.320
If She says, "All  right, you tell lies."

38:07.320 --> 38:10.320
Go on, "I'll tell lies."

38:10.320 --> 38:14.120
Like Radhaji, She said, "What is my punyas, what is my papas.

38:14.120 --> 38:19.040
I'm His wife. What can I do, whatever He tells Me."

38:19.040 --> 38:21.920
That is Shiva Tattva.

38:21.920 --> 38:27.400
When it is awakened you see it at least recognizes Shiva in Me.

38:27.400 --> 38:32.080
And it sees that this is Shiva Tattva.

38:32.080 --> 38:37.480
It understands because at Shiva Tattva you don't commit any sins,

38:37.480 --> 38:40.680
you are sinless.

38:40.680 --> 38:46.200
When you are the Spirit, you are sinless; there is no sin in you.

38:46.200 --> 38:50.240
If, supposing according to human understanding

38:50.240 --> 38:54.400
if Shiva leaves a person dies, then it's sinful. Why to leave anybody.

38:54.400 --> 38:57.560
It's sinful, isn't it? For all common purposes,

38:57.560 --> 39:02.240
common understanding will think that it is sinful for Shiva to leave

39:02.240 --> 39:05.200
the person and make the person die.

39:05.200 --> 39:08.840
For example, a lady dies, her children are left behind,

39:08.840 --> 39:10.920
then one can blame Shiva for that

39:10.920 --> 39:16.240
"See now You went away and these children are now without a mother

39:16.240 --> 39:19.440
or without a father", or something like that.

39:19.440 --> 39:24.440
Because Shiva is sinless; whatever He does is sinless.

39:24.440 --> 39:26.840
So whatever you do is sinless

39:26.840 --> 39:33.440
the idea of sin is finished because who commits sin is your ego.

39:33.440 --> 39:36.560
Ego commits sin.

39:36.560 --> 39:39.760
But if you have no ego, there's no sin

39:39.760 --> 39:43.920
because you are not doing anything.

39:43.920 --> 39:48.920
You stand in Akarma. Say the sun is shining and shining sharp

39:48.920 --> 39:53.640
and somebody wants to stand in the sun then he gets burns.

39:53.640 --> 39:57.720
It's not the fault of the sun, the sun is shining

39:57.720 --> 40:01.840
that's the job of sun.

40:01.840 --> 40:06.560
Whatever is the job of the Shiva, He is doing it. He's not sinful.

40:06.560 --> 40:11.040
It's our mental attitude makes us think, this is sin, this is not sin.

40:11.040 --> 40:15.080
But when we have ego, we are committing sins.

40:15.080 --> 40:18.000
If you ask a tiger,

40:18.000 --> 40:20.880
"You are committing a sin because you are eating a cow."

40:20.880 --> 40:24.200
He will say, "I never knew what a sin was.

40:24.200 --> 40:26.840
I don't know what sin is."

40:26.840 --> 40:29.720
It's a story when some missionaries

40:29.720 --> 40:31.760
were going away from a village, you see.

40:31.760 --> 40:35.560
So the villagers - poor, innocent villagers, they got up to thank them.

40:35.560 --> 40:39.160
They said, "Thank God, when you came here you told us there is sin.

40:39.160 --> 40:43.920
We didn't know what sin was."

40:43.920 --> 40:48.120
Innocent people, they don't know what is sin.

40:48.120 --> 40:51.120
Because Spirit is innocent, it has no sin.

40:51.120 --> 40:56.360
It obeys the other source of innocence.

40:56.360 --> 40:59.760
So there is no sin for a person who is innocent.

40:59.760 --> 41:03.120
For Shiva, there is no sin whether He wants to give

41:03.120 --> 41:05.800
His blessings to a rakshasa

41:05.800 --> 41:13.720
or to a saint. There is no sin for Him because He is bholenath.

41:13.720 --> 41:21.280
He is beyond sin. Whatever He does, He is beyond sin

41:21.280 --> 41:25.360
because ego cannot envelope Him. There is no ego.

41:25.360 --> 41:30.920
Because we have ego we commit sins.

41:30.920 --> 41:36.360
Once ego is finished we are no more there, so who commits sins?

41:36.360 --> 41:39.920
When we are not there, who is committing the sin?

41:39.920 --> 41:42.440
Shiva can't commit sins, so we are the Shiva

41:42.440 --> 41:45.600
so we cannot commit sins.

41:45.600 --> 41:48.360
So all these ideas of giving alternatives

41:48.640 --> 41:51.960
at the mental level is also wrong.

41:51.960 --> 41:56.440
I give - anything I say, immediately there will be ten suggestions.

41:56.440 --> 41:59.560
I try all these tricks with you.

41:59.560 --> 42:07.040
Because you are used to conferences, you see.

42:07.040 --> 42:12.160
So I said, "All right, Subramanian, what do you have to say about it?"

42:14.520 --> 42:18.760
Because after all, Lord Subramanian is there. Must ask him.

42:18.760 --> 42:23.040
Then I ask Venugopalan, then I'll ask Maureen

42:23.040 --> 42:29.520
all these people. Now what do you have to say?

42:29.520 --> 42:32.600
And then they give their suggestions.

42:32.600 --> 42:43.680
But if you see in the conference of all the Divine Deities,

42:43.680 --> 42:49.600
there is no suggestion, no suggestion, no alternative.

42:50.400 --> 42:54.040
No alternatives to your Mother's ideas, nothing.

42:54.040 --> 42:59.280
Absolute. It's absolute. Nobody gives any suggestions to Me;

42:59.280 --> 43:08.840
Never. No question.

43:08.840 --> 43:12.360
They won't listen to you, they won't listen to anyone.

43:12.360 --> 43:20.240
There's no question. Such harmony; complete obedience.

43:20.240 --> 43:24.800
And not only they are fixed with their qualities.

43:24.800 --> 43:31.200
They are told that you have to do it, they'll do it.

43:31.200 --> 43:35.440
This is the difference.

43:35.440 --> 43:38.760
They try. Sometimes it appears, you see.

43:38.760 --> 43:42.280
If I say all right, go this way and you will find the place

43:42.280 --> 43:44.680
but you won't find.

43:44.680 --> 43:47.720
So then you will say, 'See Mother You said to go this

43:47.720 --> 43:49.920
and that's why we went this way and we didn't find the church.'

43:49.920 --> 43:53.880
Now there it is not that I'm saying that you will find the church,

43:53.880 --> 43:59.200
it is I am trying to see what you think.

43:59.200 --> 44:04.680
I am telling you My own tricks, all right, so be careful.

44:04.680 --> 44:09.720
I'll tell you all, go this way, now you didn't find the church, I'm sorry.

44:09.720 --> 44:12.720
I should not have told you. Or you shouldn't have gone that way.

44:12.720 --> 44:15.440
But that's not true. I must tell you, that's not true.

44:15.440 --> 44:19.880
What I'm trying to see what you are saying about this.

44:19.880 --> 44:22.560
Now if you are clever, you would say,

44:22.560 --> 44:28.120
"I went there, I didn't see the place, but I saw something else, Mother

44:28.120 --> 44:32.480
that's the reason You sent me there. Now I know why You sent me there."

44:32.480 --> 44:37.280
That's it. Then I know that he is Sahaja Yogi. But if you say:

44:37.280 --> 44:40.920
"Oh I went there because I thought I will find this thing,"

44:40.920 --> 44:44.320
"but, it was not there, and 'You' sent me, 'You' sent me"

44:44.320 --> 44:50.080
Finished. If you say that, You said so and it happened

44:50.080 --> 44:55.360
or I did say, no doubt. But what I said was just to play a trick on you.

44:55.360 --> 44:58.440
Because one of the natures of your Mother is Mahamaya;

44:58.440 --> 45:01.560
so be careful. How you react

45:01.560 --> 45:04.440
is very important for Me to see how far you have gone.

45:04.440 --> 45:09.760
This is one of the ways you are judged.

45:10.280 --> 45:13.680
But for a villager, it's a different thing if you see.

45:13.680 --> 45:17.360
If I tell him: "Now if you want Me

45:17.360 --> 45:22.640
to go to that village, see, take the cart,

45:22.640 --> 45:27.360
or take the bullock cart this way; we'll take it."

45:27.360 --> 45:32.200
But there will be a ditch. So I'll get it.

45:32.200 --> 45:35.520
So he will say, "Mother, I'm sorry, you got it.

45:35.520 --> 45:39.080
I could have avoided it.

45:39.560 --> 45:42.320
See. So he takes the responsibility upon himself.

45:42.320 --> 45:44.000
He takes everything upon himself.

45:44.240 --> 45:46.320
Because you asked Me so I had to go that way

45:46.320 --> 45:50.560
but I could have avoided it if I was there careful.

45:52.040 --> 45:54.840
So this is the difference you know, not to put the responsibility.

45:54.840 --> 45:58.200
It's a common human nature is to put responsibility on somebody else.

45:58.200 --> 46:00.800
Best is to put on Mother

46:00.800 --> 46:07.680
But in that you lose all your punyas.

46:08.560 --> 46:13.200
So the responsibility is mine, I must have done some mistake.

46:13.200 --> 46:16.360
I must have done some mistake somewhere

46:16.360 --> 46:21.560
or else maybe that Mother wants me to learn something in this.

46:21.560 --> 46:25.400
Every time you do something, I tell you something,

46:25.400 --> 46:28.920
it's just for you to learn something. I don't have to learn anything.

46:29.200 --> 46:33.480
If you think that way that I have to learn something now you know.

46:33.480 --> 46:36.480
So you have to learn something.

46:36.480 --> 46:40.280
And that is what if you understand; then a kind of a detachment

46:40.280 --> 46:43.080
will build in you and a surrender.

46:43.080 --> 46:46.600
You will be amazed that you will be so much

46:46.600 --> 46:49.320
relieved of nonsensical

46:49.640 --> 46:53.600
headaches that you have and the burdens you carry.

46:53.600 --> 46:58.400
If you understand that the whole joke,

46:58.400 --> 47:02.280
the whole work, the whole drama is done by Mother

47:02.280 --> 47:07.680
and I am just playing into it. It's so simple.

47:07.680 --> 47:12.480
That is to be understood.

47:13.680 --> 47:16.400
And the enjoyment lies in that.

47:16.400 --> 47:20.440
Not in judging or finding alternatives.

47:20.440 --> 47:24.840
You try it. Those who have tried it have enjoyed it very much.

47:24.840 --> 47:29.280
And so many things. Every minute, I'll give you an example of that.

47:29.280 --> 47:31.040
I'll give you an example of Gregoire

47:31.040 --> 47:33.120
last time I went to his house.

47:33.120 --> 47:35.760
He tortured My life for his wife.

47:35.760 --> 47:38.560
When will she have her delivery, how will she have,

47:38.560 --> 47:40.160
who is going to stay with her?

47:40.160 --> 47:42.240
Morning till evening, he had one talk.

47:42.240 --> 47:44.920
All right, I said, "Something will be done.

47:44.920 --> 47:46.600
You can have this lady to stay with you."

47:46.600 --> 47:50.680
And then, "How will I go to India?" I mean, "I" was so important.

47:50.680 --> 47:53.760
Then he didn't realize it at that time,

47:53.760 --> 47:57.080
he thought it was so important to do that.

47:57.080 --> 47:59.200
Ultimately quite before going I told him,

47:59.200 --> 48:01.560
"Gregoire, you troubled Me too much this time."

48:01.560 --> 48:05.160
" But it's all right." Then he said, "I'm sorry."

48:05.160 --> 48:08.400
Then he telephoned Me one day saying,

48:08.680 --> 48:10.640
"Mother, my wife is in for abortion.

48:10.640 --> 48:14.520
She has gone to the hospital, there is no chance." I said, "Forget it.

48:14.520 --> 48:17.080
You go back to the hospital, she will be all right."

48:17.080 --> 48:19.760
He went to the hospital and they said, "It's a miracle."

48:20.160 --> 48:25.520
"She's perfectly all right, there's no problem. She's all right."

48:25.520 --> 48:28.120
So it came into his head, as he told Me.

48:28.120 --> 48:31.560
Oh, Mother is looking after it, why should I worry.

48:31.560 --> 48:34.600
Why should I worry? This is first thing.

48:34.600 --> 48:39.240
Then, the child was born earlier than time.

48:39.240 --> 48:42.680
And he came to Me.

48:42.680 --> 48:46.000
So also I convinced him, what I say

48:46.000 --> 48:49.080
what I do, you know that.

48:49.080 --> 48:50.920
That I look after you.

48:50.920 --> 48:55.200
But when you take up responsibility upon yourself and start thinking about it,

48:55.480 --> 48:57.640
then I cannot help.

48:57.640 --> 49:01.840
So just know that leave it to God.

49:01.840 --> 49:04.680
It's all for your good, for your 'hitha'

49:04.680 --> 49:06.760
Everything is for your 'hitha'.

49:06.760 --> 49:11.360
Whatever it is, sometimes I have to shout at you, sometimes I have to

49:11.360 --> 49:14.720
correct you, sometimes I have to tell you that, "Don't come here."

49:14.720 --> 49:18.920
Some people who touch Me, you see, can give me horrible sensations,

49:18.920 --> 49:21.760
then I say, "You just don't come here. You don't stand before Me,

49:21.760 --> 49:24.160
get out from here." That helps them.

49:24.160 --> 49:26.600
But if they stand there, the bhoots will never leave

49:26.600 --> 49:29.920
because the bhoots want to trouble Me.

49:31.920 --> 49:35.240
So this point if you understand, you will get completely detached

49:35.240 --> 49:39.080
and will know that for our good, for our betterment

49:39.080 --> 49:41.200
we must keep Mother pleased and

49:41.200 --> 49:44.080
these things if we do by displeasing Her,

49:44.080 --> 49:46.720
we are going to be finished.

49:46.720 --> 49:51.800
Now to understand this, what you need - not age, not position,

49:51.800 --> 49:57.920
not your qualifications, nothing - you need a wise mind.

49:58.320 --> 50:00.680
Deep personality.

50:00.680 --> 50:02.840
I've seen very young people are so sensible

50:02.840 --> 50:07.480
their parents are stupid, absolutely stupid people.

50:07.480 --> 50:10.840
So you just need a wise, deep personality to do it

50:10.840 --> 50:13.480
and that you should try to develop.

50:13.480 --> 50:16.880
That comes only sticking onto Shiva tattva,

50:17.160 --> 50:21.440
which is a solid thing, which is Shiva, Achara

50:21.440 --> 50:24.040
which doesn't move, absolute.

50:24.040 --> 50:27.200
It is not relative, it's not relative at all

50:27.200 --> 50:32.080
it's not related to anything, absolute. That gives you the depth.

50:32.080 --> 50:37.920
That depth which is required to settle down, to go deep.

50:38.320 --> 50:43.080
Shiva is your guru. Guru is the one that gives you the gravity

50:43.080 --> 50:47.880
to go straight down deep into it.

51:00.240 --> 51:04.080
That is very important. And all this

51:04.080 --> 51:09.320
I hope with the puja today

51:09.320 --> 51:12.400
we'll try to settle you

51:12.720 --> 51:17.480
into that great principle of Shiva.

51:17.840 --> 51:22.640
Let your attention, every particle of your attention be filled,

51:22.640 --> 51:37.640
sparkled and rejoice by that blessing of Shiva tattva.

51:37.640 --> 51:40.200
I bless you all! May God bless you!

51:47.120 --> 51:52.200
So to begin with, we are going to worship the Devi first of all,

51:52.200 --> 51:54.120
and then the Shiva.
