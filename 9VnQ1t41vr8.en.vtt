00:00:07.718 --> 00:00:12.518
(...) God does look after all of us.

00:00:12.598 --> 00:00:15.478
He is compassion, He is love, He has created us,

00:00:15.558 --> 00:00:19.078
He has made a beautiful human being out of us,

00:00:19.158 --> 00:00:21.158
within us He has placed all these centres,

00:00:21.238 --> 00:00:24.478
He has placed the Kundalini within
us, and the Kundalini has to rise,

00:00:24.558 --> 00:00:28.798
you have to get realization, all that is so, no doubt.

00:00:28.878 --> 00:00:33.678
All this has to work out. That’s also the truth is.

00:00:33.758 --> 00:00:40.318
But still, one must know that He is not in your hand,

00:00:40.398 --> 00:00:43.278
you are in His hand.

00:00:43.358 --> 00:00:48.118
There are many people who pray to God: “Give me promotion.

00:00:48.198 --> 00:00:51.718
O God, you have to give me promotion”.

00:00:51.798 --> 00:00:56.718
And then if He doesn’t give, “This God is not helpful to me!

00:00:56.798 --> 00:01:02.438
Why has He not given me promotion?”
You should not cheapen God like that.

00:01:02.518 --> 00:01:07.678
God is the one Who is Almighty,
Who has created all this Universe.

00:01:07.758 --> 00:01:12.518
He has created you, and He has created you for a purpose.

00:01:12.598 --> 00:01:18.718
And that purpose is something
Supreme. That’s not ordinary purpose,

00:01:18.798 --> 00:01:23.198
the way you think Him to be, He is not an ordinary person.

00:01:23.278 --> 00:01:27.198
He is Supreme and He will give you something that is Supreme.

00:01:27.278 --> 00:01:34.838
Supposing you go to see some
king, he will not give you 1p, will he?

00:01:36.038 --> 00:01:39.078
He may give you a diamond.

00:01:39.158 --> 00:01:46.558
But if you want to ask anything from
God then you must ask for the Supreme!

00:01:46.638 --> 00:01:53.518
And what is the Supreme? The Supreme is to know Him.

00:01:53.598 --> 00:01:59.318
Unless and until you know your
Self, you are not going to know Him.

00:01:59.398 --> 00:02:05.358
He has placed within you that instrument
by which you first know your Self.

00:02:05.438 --> 00:02:11.358
Once you know your Self, through your Self you know Him.

00:02:11.438 --> 00:02:16.998
But the first important thing is
that your attention has to be on Him.

00:02:17.078 --> 00:02:21.838
There’s a very different thing to have attention on God

00:02:21.918 --> 00:02:24.678
and to have a blind faith in God.

00:02:24.758 --> 00:02:30.318
These two things are absolutely far apart.

00:02:30.398 --> 00:02:34.118
To have faith in God means – I’ve already told you

00:02:34.198 --> 00:02:38.878
all the silly things we do in the name of faith.

00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:43.478
But to have your attention on God is

00:02:43.558 --> 00:02:48.358
to ask: “When am I going to be my Self?

00:02:48.438 --> 00:02:54.078
When are You going to accept me as a citizen of Your Kingdom?

00:02:54.158 --> 00:02:57.958
When are You going to use me as Your instrument, O Lord?”

00:02:58.038 --> 00:03:01.678
This should be your attention. If your attention is like that,

00:03:01.758 --> 00:03:06.318
and if you are really of pure nature about it,

00:03:06.398 --> 00:03:09.438
it will work out, it works out.

00:03:09.518 --> 00:03:12.198
This is the only thing that is needed in Sahaja Yoga,

00:03:12.278 --> 00:03:18.798
is a clean heart to ask for it, to desire for it.

00:03:18.878 --> 00:03:21.318
(...) But today, we have to understand one thing:

00:03:21.398 --> 00:03:26.958
that the essences within us – for
example innocence – is absolutely pure.

00:03:27.038 --> 00:03:33.198
Within us it is absolutely pure. In
its own form it is absolutely pure.

00:03:33.278 --> 00:03:40.078
But, when it is reflected through our medium, it gets soiled.

00:03:40.158 --> 00:03:44.638
The way you are, the way you express it, it gets spoiled.

00:03:44.718 --> 00:03:49.878
If you are a cunning person, the innocence cannot be manifested,

00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:54.678
it cannot be manifested. Your innocence,
whatever God has placed within you

00:03:54.758 --> 00:03:59.358
is completely darkened because you cannot reflect it back.

00:03:59.438 --> 00:04:05.038
There is no manifestation about it. Why it happens?

00:04:05.118 --> 00:04:11.118
If you are pure, if you are all
right, the innocence is all right,

00:04:11.198 --> 00:04:14.398
then why it is not manifested through you?

00:04:14.478 --> 00:04:18.798
Why this cunningness can stop
that innocence or any other essences

00:04:18.878 --> 00:04:23.598
that are within you, which you
know which exist on different chakras?

00:04:23.678 --> 00:04:30.158
We must think about it, why it
happens. That even after realization,

00:04:30.238 --> 00:04:34.278
we cannot properly manifest our innocence,

00:04:34.358 --> 00:04:39.638
our primordial powers

00:04:39.718 --> 00:04:43.038
which are within us in absolute purest form.

00:04:43.118 --> 00:04:50.318
Why? What happens within us? The trouble is with our attention.

00:04:50.398 --> 00:04:54.238
When you became human beings, you were given full freedom

00:04:54.318 --> 00:04:58.478
to put your attention onto anything you wanted.

00:04:58.558 --> 00:05:05.398
Say, if you want, you can put your attention onto any subject.

00:05:05.478 --> 00:05:09.638
Say I receive a telephone call. So I put my attention to it.

00:05:09.718 --> 00:05:12.238
Now, I can go on identifying with it, thinking about it;

00:05:12.318 --> 00:05:15.358
all my attention will be enveloped and I will not pay attention

00:05:15.438 --> 00:05:19.198
to anything else that is happening.

00:05:20.478 --> 00:05:23.998
The attention is so mobile, it has no base

00:05:24.078 --> 00:05:28.878
as if the whole thing, like a jelly,
goes and gets attached to a thing.

00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:32.398
(...) I mean if you waste your
attention on foolish nonsensical things,

00:05:32.478 --> 00:05:36.398
what’s going to happen?

00:05:36.478 --> 00:05:39.118
So this is how we put our attention

00:05:39.198 --> 00:05:46.598
onto absolutely useless things;
sometimes onto very depraved things also.

00:05:46.678 --> 00:05:49.318
We may put our attention to anything

00:05:49.398 --> 00:05:57.518
that we think “requires our attention”.
But do you have your self-esteem?

00:05:57.598 --> 00:06:02.238
If you have, then where should be your attention?

00:06:02.318 --> 00:06:07.798
It should be on your Self. Where is your Self now?

00:06:07.878 --> 00:06:15.638
It is God Almighty. Is a part of that Great Primordial Being.

00:06:15.718 --> 00:06:20.878
Your attention should be on That.

00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:26.398
After realization, your attention should be in your heart,

00:06:26.478 --> 00:06:32.518
on your Spirit, which is the part of God Almighty.

00:06:32.598 --> 00:06:39.838
If your attention is on your Spirit, you’ll
be amazed, how your attention will act.

00:06:39.918 --> 00:06:42.958
You see, like a jelly which is attached to a point.

00:06:43.038 --> 00:06:46.078
It may little bit get disturbed, again it will settle down.

00:06:46.158 --> 00:06:48.678
Again, it will get little bit disturbed, it will settle down.

00:06:48.758 --> 00:06:54.798
It will not hang on to any point, and will not bother you.

00:06:54.878 --> 00:06:58.278
So to put all your essences properly, first of all,

00:06:58.358 --> 00:07:03.198
put your attention to your heart and to your Spirit,

00:07:03.278 --> 00:07:06.958
because that’s your absolute point which you have discovered.

00:07:07.038 --> 00:07:09.358
But it doesn’t happen with many people.

00:07:09.438 --> 00:07:14.838
The trouble is, when Kundalini rises,
She gives two kinds of experiences.

00:07:14.918 --> 00:07:18.758
One is called as Shambhavi, another called as Shakti.

00:07:18.838 --> 00:07:26.358
Shambhavi is the feeling of the Shambhu, is
the Shiva in the heart, means God Almighty.

00:07:26.438 --> 00:07:29.078
But the other is Shakti.

00:07:29.158 --> 00:07:34.158
Now with western people it is the
other, because you know your problems.

00:07:34.238 --> 00:07:40.718
You have used your powers for all
kinds of ramblings in your mental efforts.

00:07:40.798 --> 00:07:43.718
Everything [Everyone] will sit down.
“All right, let us discuss realization!”

00:07:43.798 --> 00:07:46.958
What are you going to discuss?

00:07:48.558 --> 00:07:51.678
What are you going to discuss about realization?

00:07:51.758 --> 00:07:55.998
Did you get your realization by discussion?

00:07:56.078 --> 00:08:00.798
You have to meditate! You have to go within yourselves.

00:08:00.878 --> 00:08:04.038
See your growth, work out within!

00:08:04.118 --> 00:08:06.598
You cannot talk about it, you cannot discuss it,

00:08:06.678 --> 00:08:10.958
you cannot argue about it – it is within!

00:08:11.038 --> 00:08:14.638
Because of these ramblings, we go up to the shakti point.

00:08:14.718 --> 00:08:17.558
But Shambhu’s we do not reach.

00:08:17.638 --> 00:08:20.878
But in the East where people are not that much intelligent,

00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:26.558
that well-educated and sophisticated, I would say -

00:08:26.638 --> 00:08:32.918
simple people, it goes just there. And they just enjoy.

00:08:32.998 --> 00:08:35.518
If you show them any book, written about Sahaja Yoga –

00:08:35.598 --> 00:08:37.598
for example Gregoire’s book - they’ll say,

00:08:37.678 --> 00:08:41.878
“Mother, we don’t want it, to read, we don’t understand this”.

00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.318
They are just there! They are now there. What is there now?

00:08:44.398 --> 00:08:47.958
It’s flowing through our body, everything we know it’s there.

00:08:48.038 --> 00:08:52.158
Why should we bother about these
things and all the controversies and dogmas,

00:08:52.238 --> 00:08:55.558
and what all the Churches have told you, and why they have failed

00:08:55.638 --> 00:09:00.718
and why this religion has failed? Who is bothered?!

00:09:00.798 --> 00:09:03.278
So these problems come up.

00:09:03.358 --> 00:09:09.278
Because their attention has been on the Spirit alone.

00:09:09.358 --> 00:09:13.758
Simple people have that capacity.

00:09:13.838 --> 00:09:17.358
So now forgetting everything else, all your intelligence,

00:09:17.438 --> 00:09:22.758
all your books and education
and all that you have had – forget it.

00:09:22.838 --> 00:09:25.678
And just put your attention to your heart,

00:09:25.758 --> 00:09:30.918
where lies the connection with God Almighty.

00:09:30.998 --> 00:09:33.518
If your attention is there,

00:09:33.598 --> 00:09:39.758
you will be surprised that your attention will be stabilised.

00:09:39.838 --> 00:09:47.038
Not only that it will be stabilised,
but the source of joy is that

00:09:47.118 --> 00:09:51.318
and you will start feeling that joy.

00:09:51.398 --> 00:09:54.358
(...) But if you want to co-operate and help yourself,

00:09:54.438 --> 00:09:58.198
then you have to put your attention in such a way

00:09:58.278 --> 00:10:04.638
that – every problem comes in –
you go to your heart, not to your brain.

00:10:04.718 --> 00:10:07.118
Any question comes in, go to your heart.

00:10:07.198 --> 00:10:12.278
There resides the blessings of God. And
you will be surprised how it will be solved.

00:10:12.358 --> 00:10:15.078
That’s why I said “Go into thoughtless awareness.”

00:10:15.158 --> 00:10:19.878
That is the quality of heart, because heart doesn’t think.

00:10:21.118 --> 00:10:27.038
You go to your heart, means
you put your attention to your Spirit.

00:10:27.118 --> 00:10:29.718
(...) You Sahaja Yogis have to be people

00:10:29.798 --> 00:10:37.118
of higher outward manifestation. Inside you are,

00:10:37.198 --> 00:10:41.278
but outward manifestation has to be higher.

00:10:41.358 --> 00:10:47.998
You have to be humbler people, kinder people, sweeter people,

00:10:48.078 --> 00:10:52.518
loving people, compassionate, understanding

00:10:52.598 --> 00:11:01.158
that you were there, where they are
today; joyous people and cheerful people.

00:11:01.238 --> 00:11:04.118
Otherwise nobody is going to believe what is happening

00:11:04.198 --> 00:11:06.838
in the Kundalini inside, because whatever is happening

00:11:06.918 --> 00:11:10.158
is happening, you cannot see that.

00:11:10.238 --> 00:11:13.678
It is important that it should be evident on your face,

00:11:13.758 --> 00:11:18.918
in your behaviour, in everything. For that you have to understand

00:11:18.998 --> 00:11:25.678
that you have to stabilise your
attention at the lotus feet of God.

00:11:25.758 --> 00:11:28.278
This is called as ‘Sharanagati’ – surrendering.

00:11:28.358 --> 00:11:35.958
By surrendering, by worshipping, by bhakti, by singing songs,

00:11:36.038 --> 00:11:42.598
by absolutely settling yourself
at the lotus feet of God Almighty.

00:11:42.678 --> 00:11:45.318
That’s the only way you are going to achieve it.

00:11:45.398 --> 00:11:50.758
After realization only, you have
the entry into the Kingdom of God.

00:11:50.838 --> 00:11:53.718
Before that, whatever you try has no meaning.

00:11:53.798 --> 00:11:58.438
Muslims do all the Namaz, morning
till evening – do not get anything!

00:11:58.518 --> 00:12:00.558
But we had some Muslims, you know that.

00:12:00.638 --> 00:12:03.238
Once he started after realization, he said,

00:12:03.318 --> 00:12:06.078
“Every time I bend I get vibrations. Every time I say

00:12:06.158 --> 00:12:10.078
Allah’s name I get vibration.” It has happened with all of them.

00:12:10.158 --> 00:12:16.758
Because God exists, He is there, it’s a fact.

00:12:16.838 --> 00:12:22.358
And the time has come for all of us to feel Him and know Him.

00:12:22.438 --> 00:12:26.318
(...) Please put your attention to your heart.

00:12:28.158 --> 00:12:31.478
(...) Yogini: Mother, when you
said ‘Put your attention on your heart’

00:12:31.558 --> 00:12:35.478
do you mean the heart chakra? ”
Shri Mataji: You cannot feel heart.

00:12:35.558 --> 00:12:37.878
You cannot know heart chakra, nothing!

00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:41.998
When I say that, just say that,
‘I’m putting My attention to My Spirit’,

00:12:42.078 --> 00:12:45.478
that’s all. Your saying is a mantra itself.

00:12:45.558 --> 00:12:48.318
You know now you are a realised soul.

00:12:48.398 --> 00:12:52.398
You are an enlightened person, your desire is enlightened.

00:12:52.478 --> 00:12:58.158
And if you just say that ‘My
attention is on my Spirit in my heart,

00:12:58.238 --> 00:13:01.638
in the organ of heart…’

00:13:07.758 --> 00:13:12.638
You see now, whatever you say has a meaning.

00:13:12.718 --> 00:13:18.118
Do you understand? Whatever you
say is enlightened now, there’s a light in it.

00:13:18.198 --> 00:13:21.598
Only thing is, if your attention is not all right still,

00:13:21.678 --> 00:13:29.878
then the light is still dim. If in the dim
light, you see half things, but you do see.

00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:32.958
But if it is a bright light you can see it very clearly.

00:13:33.038 --> 00:13:39.798
So to brighten up the light, you
just say that, “Let me be in my heart.”

00:13:39.878 --> 00:13:43.958
It works out, settles down, you see?

00:13:44.038 --> 00:13:46.678
As if you order your attention to be there.

00:13:46.758 --> 00:13:50.598
It just goes like a, like a sweet little baby, you see.

00:13:50.678 --> 00:13:53.518
Sits down there, “All right, Mother, whatever you say.”

00:13:53.598 --> 00:13:57.078
Just say like that. Just try to feel your powers.

00:13:57.158 --> 00:14:01.558
What you say, how it works out.

00:14:01.638 --> 00:14:06.718
Even when you say mantras, these mantras are also enlightened.
