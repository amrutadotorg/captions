00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:02.399
“Where is our attention?” we should say.

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.390
You are meditating, take it deep down into
yourself.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.950
That’s a meditative mood.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.260
Keep yourself there.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.820
And after meditation you just get up silently,
sit for a while.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.590
I think best thing will be to have your food
first and then meditate,

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.800
if that is so, if you think that is proper.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:34.810
But I think if you have to get now into that
new triggering, as I told you,

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:40.790
into that new jumping that we have to do in
Sahaja Yoga: if you have to catch that train,

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.579
then you hurry up.

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:45.870
You have to change all these ideas.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.070
You have had many houses,

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.000
you have had many wives and many children
in your previous life.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.930
You never had your realisation – now you
have got it.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.219
So now just every individual, every one of
you should not think of others,

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:07.040
Think of yourself, “I have to do it, I have
to get it, I have to work it out.”

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.249
This is what you have to do.

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:11.039
“Why should I miss it?”

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:16.590
This is a chance of many lives, the chance
of many lives.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.049
And that’s how you can jump over, and work
it out.

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:27.820
We had lots of people in Australia,

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.360
and if they had worried about themselves as
to “what I have done for Sahaja Yoga.”

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.069
So in the morning you just decide,

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:36.649
what I am going to do for Sahaja Yog and myself;

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:41.590
in the evening, what have I done for myself,
and what have I done for Sahaja Yoga?

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.550
“Myself” doesn’t mean selfishness, but
“for my ascent.”

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:46.999
Every day.

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:49.509
You start a diary to write it down.

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.820
You face yourself.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.619
No excuses, nothing.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.980
If you are left behind, what we can do?

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:01.200
We can’t help it.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.080
And that is how you’ll find all kinds of
blessings will come to you.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.790
You’ll be able to save money, you’ll be
able to save time, you’ll get good jobs.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.000
All your problems can be solved

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.540
if you really surrender yourself to that Paramachaitanya.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.500
Everything can be done.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.650
But as long as you have this narrow-mindedness

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.970
and these narrow ideas about yourself, till
then it won’t work out.

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.130
This drop has to become one with the ocean,
then ocean takes over.
