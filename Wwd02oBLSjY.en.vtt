WEBVTT

00:02.720 --> 00:09.720
Happy Diwali to you all! May God bless you!

00:12.830 --> 00:19.830
It’s a nice occasion that we could all meet
together on this auspicious day. And actually

00:22.929 --> 00:28.488
today is the day of the brothers and sisters.
It’s also very nice that you are all meeting

00:28.489 --> 00:35.489
your brothers and sisters here and enjoying
this Diwali function. We had a very nice function

00:36.140 --> 00:43.140
in India. And it was celebrated in Bombay
and they all salute their good wishes and

00:47.010 --> 00:54.010
Happy Diwali to all of you. They all remembered
you very much. Now, today I am not going to

00:58.900 --> 01:03.910
give you a speech. But I have to tell you
certain things about the Indian Tour that

01:03.910 --> 01:08.350
we are going to have. Because I don’t think
I’ll be able to talk to you about it later

01:08.350 --> 01:13.789
on. So, first of all I wanted to know the
girls who are engaged in India, can you get

01:13.790 --> 01:20.790
up and – anyone of them are here. Those
girls who were engaged in India. They are

01:20.880 --> 01:27.880
not here? None of them? So, I hope the leaders
know who were the girls engaged in their areas,

01:31.690 --> 01:38.690
isn’t it? Now, you have to see that the
boys and the girls who were engaged. Are there

01:39.110 --> 01:45.070
boys who were engaged in your area? Anybody
from Graz?

01:45.070 --> 01:46.690
Sahaja Yogi: Thomas W.

01:46.690 --> 01:49.179
Shri Mataji: Two boys from Graz?

01:49.180 --> 01:55.729
SY: Yes. Thomas W., he is engaged to the daughter
of Dhumal.

01:55.729 --> 02:02.270
Shri Mataji: But he is not getting married
this year. No, no, from Graz.

02:02.270 --> 02:09.269
SY: Bernhard and Martin, Shri Mataji. They
are both on the tour.

02:09.479 --> 02:16.479
Shri Mataji: They are both on the tour. So,
in the same way one should know that, say,

02:18.200 --> 02:24.959
all those girls who are engaged anywhere – or
the boys who are engaged must come on this

02:24.959 --> 02:31.959
tour. And you should consult Me, all of you,
all the leaders, sometimes, tomorrow to finalize

02:33.880 --> 02:40.880
those who are coming, those who are not coming
and their photographs and their forms. I hope

02:42.450 --> 02:45.099
you have brought it.

02:45.099 --> 02:51.149
We’ve decided now on certain things which
your leaders must have told you that those

02:51.150 --> 02:58.150
people who are on the tour shouldn’t bring
too many clothes and too many – what do

02:59.459 --> 03:05.819
you call them – toiletries. (Laughter) Specially
for the ladies. Because some people have complained

03:05.819 --> 03:10.910
that their hands started paining the way they
had to handle all these heavy things. (Shri

03:10.910 --> 03:17.910
Mataji laughing) So, to be kind to them is
to bring some sort of a soft bag and we are

03:19.700 --> 03:26.700
supplying you with six kurtas and six pyjamas
and also garments. For 36 pounds only. You

03:30.730 --> 03:37.730
paid about, I think, 28 pounds for one kurta
pyjama in London. So this is going to be there.

03:39.390 --> 03:45.379
Plus, for the ladies we’ve got six saris
and six blouses and six petticoats, very good

03:45.379 --> 03:50.420
quality. Only for again 36 pounds. We had
put it 30 pounds but with just cutting very,

03:50.420 --> 03:56.708
very sharp. So we have put it 36 pounds. With
one pound we have increased on every item.

03:56.709 --> 04:02.129
For all the ladies. So, please don’t bring
too many western clothes, there’s no need.

04:02.129 --> 04:07.239
Whatever you travel with you can travel back
with. And there are saris and petticoats,

04:07.239 --> 04:12.629
everything available for you, we are working
it out. On your – the way you have sent

04:12.629 --> 04:19.629
your measurements and you know how difficult
it is for so many people – 700 saris I’ve

04:20.440 --> 04:25.580
bought so far. But if there are more ladies
going to come, I don’t know, we’ll have

04:25.580 --> 04:30.750
to again arrange. Imagine, 700 saris and then
the saris have to be matched with blouses,

04:30.750 --> 04:35.350
and the saris have to be also matched with
the petticoats. And every person has a different

04:35.350 --> 04:40.430
measurement. So what a combination it is.
Just put into mathematically I don’t know

04:40.430 --> 04:44.310
what raised to what (Shri Mataji laughing)
and same with the boys simple is that their

04:44.310 --> 04:48.160
measurements are different, but otherwise
cloth is the same, not such a problem, because

04:48.160 --> 04:52.560
ladies can’t have the same saris like a
uniform. So we had to buy different colors,

04:52.560 --> 04:57.430
different things. So, it’s all we have done
all this work for you so that you don’t

04:57.430 --> 05:04.430
bring big, big, huge suitcases. And now there’s
another decision has been taken: anybody brings

05:04.570 --> 05:11.570
a very heavy, huge suitcase will be left in
Bombay, nobody is going to carry it. (Laughter

05:12.449 --> 05:13.630
& applause)

05:13.630 --> 05:19.550
You know, once we broke one of the top of
the buses. And this time the bus people refused

05:19.550 --> 05:26.090
that, “We will not give you any buses any
more. Because you put very heavy luggage on

05:26.090 --> 05:33.090
that.” So I have to make a very, very specific
request to you that, “Please, don’t bring

05:34.430 --> 05:40.199
big bags.” You can buy something nice in
India if you want to bring some more things

05:40.199 --> 05:46.520
from there. But just now, just for going and
coming what you have to do is to think about

05:46.520 --> 05:53.520
these saris that you have already and also
one sleeping bag with a foam of our three

05:53.790 --> 05:58.539
inches. That’s the thing that we have failed,
because we tried to make some mattresses in

05:58.539 --> 06:03.949
India were spoiled by rain. So, foam is the
best thing, but with three inches on your

06:03.949 --> 06:09.810
sleeping bag. Everybody should bring a sleeping
bag, no need – everybody should bring a

06:09.810 --> 06:16.810
sleeping bag and in a sleeping bag you should
have three inches to four inches of foam,

06:18.680 --> 06:23.330
three by six. And which you can leave it in
India and I don’t think then you will have

06:23.330 --> 06:29.310
any trouble afterwards. The ones you had brought
before were very thin ones, they were no good.

06:29.310 --> 06:36.310
So, this time bring only three to four inches
of foam, just ordinary foam. In India also

06:36.500 --> 06:41.979
we get foam, the problem is the foam is not
that good and it might just give me. So it’s

06:41.979 --> 06:48.979
better to bring foam from here. And try to
avoid to bring unnecessary things. There is

06:50.509 --> 06:53.740
no need to bother because all the presents
and all that I’m going to carry for you.

06:53.740 --> 07:00.740
So you don’t have to worry.

07:01.050 --> 07:08.050
Those who have still thinking whether to go
or not to go should decide immediately. Look,

07:08.560 --> 07:13.370
it’s going to be difficult – last minute
if somebody wants to come it’s impossible.

07:13.370 --> 07:17.970
Last time some people had to walk, because
we cannot have a bus for five people who are

07:17.970 --> 07:22.780
coming late or ten people who are coming late.
So the best thing is you should all decide

07:22.780 --> 07:27.840
those who want to come and should pay your
money and complete the whole thing. Money

07:27.840 --> 07:33.650
should be paid as soon as possible, because
I’ll be going on this Sunday. So it should

07:33.650 --> 07:39.630
be something tomorrow or day after you should
be able to pay all your money. All the leaders

07:39.630 --> 07:44.710
must pay their money and should manage the
show.

07:44.710 --> 07:51.710
Now the marriages’ proposals and all that
we have got already. And all the leaders must

07:53.300 --> 07:58.960
give marriage proposals to Me tomorrow which
we’ll decide here and will finalize it here

07:58.960 --> 08:04.729
as many as possible. And then we have to ask
people. But now one should not be also sort

08:04.729 --> 08:09.068
of – some people say, “We don’t want
to marry Indians”. Some people say, “We

08:09.069 --> 08:13.060
don’t want to…” – specially Australians
did say so. But now we discovered that all

08:13.060 --> 08:19.840
Australians were caught up. One person went
who was horrible. All were caught up except

08:19.840 --> 08:26.840
for the Indians. Indians don’t catch. They
don’t catch, they don’t have ego. And

08:29.289 --> 08:34.708
egos are stupid, idiotic things they do, very
stupid and idiotic things, with ego.

08:34.708 --> 08:41.708
So that’s what it is, they don’t catch,
they don’t do these things. I mean, they

08:42.179 --> 08:47.100
are consistent. So to say, “We’ll not
have Indians”, it’s another non-sensical

08:47.100 --> 08:50.489
thing. How many Indians could say, “We don’t
want these countries, or that country”,

08:50.489 --> 08:56.910
but that’s not Sahaj. So one should not
say like that. There’s one thing good about

08:56.910 --> 09:03.069
them – they never catch. And they don’t
loose their vibrations. We have only one single

09:03.069 --> 09:10.069
example so far in India who got vibrations
and lost it – one person among all of them.

09:15.639 --> 09:20.819
So that’s one thing about them, they don’t
loose their vibrations. Maybe somebody who

09:20.819 --> 09:26.089
has come here might have lost, I don’t know,
but as far as India is concerned one single

09:26.089 --> 09:31.389
example we know.

09:31.389 --> 09:35.819
So this is the point one has to remember not
to say, “I don’t want to marry an Indian,

09:35.819 --> 09:39.290
I don’t want to marry an Egyptian and I
don’t want to marry a certain thing.”

09:39.290 --> 09:44.920
This is not allowed in Sahaja Yoga, we don’t
believe in cast, creed, race or any country.

09:44.920 --> 09:51.420
If you are so conscious about your races you
better give up Sahaja Yoga. It’s a simple

09:51.420 --> 09:58.420
thing as that. Because now it has been shown
clearly that we have false ideas about ourselves.

10:00.929 --> 10:07.929
So, this is another point that you should
not say, of course – I mean, if you don’t

10:07.929 --> 10:11.488
want to go out of your country, you can say,
“I don’t want to go out of my country.”

10:11.489 --> 10:18.489
That’s a different thing. But what is your
country? That means you are not yet in Sahaj.

10:24.779 --> 10:28.829
If you are in the ocean of Sahaja then you
don’t think – ocean doesn’t say that,

10:28.829 --> 10:35.349
“This is my shore, that is my shore.”
It’s just an ocean. If you have understood

10:35.350 --> 10:40.470
Sahaj then you must accept Sahaj ways of life.
One of them is we are not to believe in all

10:40.470 --> 10:46.929
this non-sensical ideas of boundaries that
have come to us. You could have been born

10:46.929 --> 10:52.009
in anywhere. And you are told from childhood
that you are English or you are Indian, you

10:52.009 --> 10:57.239
are this you are that, it’s all conditioning.
And a very subtle conditioning, we should

10:57.239 --> 11:03.860
get rid of it. It’s better that we try now
to get rid of it. And if you don’t feel

11:03.860 --> 11:07.579
like marrying you can say that, “We don’t
want to marry.” Nobody is forced in Sahaja

11:07.579 --> 11:13.258
Yoga, as you know that. You must tell Me beforehand,
no brainwashing, nothing, in all your freedom,

11:13.259 --> 11:19.509
in all your glory you must say, “Yes”,
otherwise I will not allow you to marry anyone.

11:19.509 --> 11:24.799
No compulsion of any kind, I have told you
100 times. Nobody is compelled. If you don’t

11:24.799 --> 11:30.829
want to marry just say, “No”, that’s
all.

11:30.829 --> 11:37.829
So, after this time the program is all very
fine in Ganapatipule, because I have kept

11:40.679 --> 11:47.679
two days extra on the 29th, we’ll finish,
but 30th and 31st, two days for all of you

11:49.519 --> 11:56.439
to go to Alibag. Now, some people, if they
are leaving later on also can stay in Alibag

11:56.439 --> 12:01.819
for no more payment or anything. And those
who have to leave on the 1st can leave from

12:01.819 --> 12:06.910
Alibag. So two days we have kept there where
married couples can meet and decide about

12:06.910 --> 12:13.329
things. So it will be time for you to decide
what you want to do and talk to your bride

12:13.329 --> 12:19.488
or your husband, whatever may be the case.
So that there is no problem on that. And then

12:19.489 --> 12:23.059
it won’t happen that you just get married
and run away sort of thing won’t happen.

12:23.059 --> 12:27.339
(Shri Mataji laughing) So you will meet each
other and that will be a nice time to talk

12:27.339 --> 12:33.730
to each other and find out about others. Now,
any questions? You please ask Me, just now.

12:33.730 --> 12:38.040
About going to India.

12:38.040 --> 12:43.199
One more point they were saying that supposing
we come for 10 days or five days, all right,

12:43.199 --> 12:47.089
it’s all right, can be arrangement, you
have to come on your own, we can’t arrange

12:47.089 --> 12:51.489
your coming and also the payment part, you
have to pay, because we have to pay wholesale

12:51.489 --> 12:58.489
price for everything.

12:58.639 --> 13:05.639
So this time we cannot give concessions of
that kind that we did last time. Because everything

13:06.259 --> 13:11.420
is now catered, a catering is there, it’s
not done by Sahaja Yoga. So we have to pay

13:11.420 --> 13:18.139
the caterer the money beforehand. And if you
don’t pay, who is going to pay, is the point.

13:18.139 --> 13:25.139
So, if you can’t pay just don’t come.
If you can pay come along. And the minimum

13:28.989 --> 13:34.959
of minimum we have tried to keep everything
minimum of minimum. So can you imagine in

13:34.959 --> 13:41.959
36 pounds you can’t get six saris, six petticoats,
six blouses anywhere. Rommel must be wondering

13:44.809 --> 13:50.689
how am I going to manage (Shri Mataji laughing)
– it’s impossible, but this has happened.

13:50.689 --> 13:57.689
You are lucky people. (Shri Mataji laughing)
That’s all I can say.

14:02.759 --> 14:09.759
So – no question? No questions? No question?

14:10.369 --> 14:17.369
Marcus? Where are you going to come? Is he
willing to marry?

14:19.470 --> 14:26.470
Anybody who has questions please ask now or
let Me know before

15:39.189 --> 15:46.189
I leave, all right? Any question.
