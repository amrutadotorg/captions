00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:09.720
Happy Diwali to you all! May God bless you!

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:19.830
It’s a nice occasion that we could all meet
together on this auspicious day. And actually

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:28.488
today is the day of the brothers and sisters.
It’s also very nice that you are all meeting

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:35.489
your brothers and sisters here and enjoying
this Diwali function. We had a very nice function

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:43.140
in India. And it was celebrated in Bombay
and they all salute their good wishes and

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:54.010
Happy Diwali to all of you. They all remembered
you very much. Now, today I am not going to

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.910
give you a speech. But I have to tell you
certain things about the Indian Tour that

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.350
we are going to have. Because I don’t think
I’ll be able to talk to you about it later

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.789
on. So, first of all I wanted to know the
girls who are engaged in India, can you get

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:20.790
up and – anyone of them are here. Those
girls who were engaged in India. They are

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.880
not here? None of them? So, I hope the leaders
know who were the girls engaged in their areas,

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:38.690
isn’t it? Now, you have to see that the
boys and the girls who were engaged. Are there

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:45.070
boys who were engaged in your area? Anybody
from Graz?

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.690
Sahaja Yogi: Thomas W.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.179
Shri Mataji: Two boys from Graz?

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:55.729
SY: Yes. Thomas W., he is engaged to the daughter
of Dhumal.

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:02.270
Shri Mataji: But he is not getting married
this year. No, no, from Graz.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:09.269
SY: Bernhard and Martin, Shri Mataji. They
are both on the tour.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:16.479
Shri Mataji: They are both on the tour. So,
in the same way one should know that, say,

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.959
all those girls who are engaged anywhere – or
the boys who are engaged must come on this

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:31.959
tour. And you should consult Me, all of you,
all the leaders, sometimes, tomorrow to finalize

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:40.880
those who are coming, those who are not coming
and their photographs and their forms. I hope

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.099
you have brought it.

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:51.149
We’ve decided now on certain things which
your leaders must have told you that those

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:58.150
people who are on the tour shouldn’t bring
too many clothes and too many – what do

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:05.819
you call them – toiletries. (Laughter) Specially
for the ladies. Because some people have complained

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.910
that their hands started paining the way they
had to handle all these heavy things. (Shri

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:17.910
Mataji laughing) So, to be kind to them is
to bring some sort of a soft bag and we are

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:26.700
supplying you with six kurtas and six pyjamas
and also garments. For 36 pounds only. You

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:37.730
paid about, I think, 28 pounds for one kurta
pyjama in London. So this is going to be there.

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:45.379
Plus, for the ladies we’ve got six saris
and six blouses and six petticoats, very good

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:50.420
quality. Only for again 36 pounds. We had
put it 30 pounds but with just cutting very,

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:56.708
very sharp. So we have put it 36 pounds. With
one pound we have increased on every item.

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:02.129
For all the ladies. So, please don’t bring
too many western clothes, there’s no need.

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:07.239
Whatever you travel with you can travel back
with. And there are saris and petticoats,

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:12.629
everything available for you, we are working
it out. On your – the way you have sent

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:19.629
your measurements and you know how difficult
it is for so many people – 700 saris I’ve

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.580
bought so far. But if there are more ladies
going to come, I don’t know, we’ll have

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.750
to again arrange. Imagine, 700 saris and then
the saris have to be matched with blouses,

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.350
and the saris have to be also matched with
the petticoats. And every person has a different

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.430
measurement. So what a combination it is.
Just put into mathematically I don’t know

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.310
what raised to what (Shri Mataji laughing)
and same with the boys simple is that their

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.160
measurements are different, but otherwise
cloth is the same, not such a problem, because

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.560
ladies can’t have the same saris like a
uniform. So we had to buy different colors,

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.430
different things. So, it’s all we have done
all this work for you so that you don’t

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:04.430
bring big, big, huge suitcases. And now there’s
another decision has been taken: anybody brings

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:11.570
a very heavy, huge suitcase will be left in
Bombay, nobody is going to carry it. (Laughter

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:13.630
& applause)

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:19.550
You know, once we broke one of the top of
the buses. And this time the bus people refused

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:26.090
that, “We will not give you any buses any
more. Because you put very heavy luggage on

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:33.090
that.” So I have to make a very, very specific
request to you that, “Please, don’t bring

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:40.199
big bags.” You can buy something nice in
India if you want to bring some more things

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:46.520
from there. But just now, just for going and
coming what you have to do is to think about

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:53.520
these saris that you have already and also
one sleeping bag with a foam of our three

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:58.539
inches. That’s the thing that we have failed,
because we tried to make some mattresses in

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:03.949
India were spoiled by rain. So, foam is the
best thing, but with three inches on your

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:09.810
sleeping bag. Everybody should bring a sleeping
bag, no need – everybody should bring a

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:16.810
sleeping bag and in a sleeping bag you should
have three inches to four inches of foam,

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.330
three by six. And which you can leave it in
India and I don’t think then you will have

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:29.310
any trouble afterwards. The ones you had brought
before were very thin ones, they were no good.

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:36.310
So, this time bring only three to four inches
of foam, just ordinary foam. In India also

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:41.979
we get foam, the problem is the foam is not
that good and it might just give me. So it’s

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:48.979
better to bring foam from here. And try to
avoid to bring unnecessary things. There is

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:53.740
no need to bother because all the presents
and all that I’m going to carry for you.

00:06:53.740 --> 00:07:00.740
So you don’t have to worry.

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:08.050
Those who have still thinking whether to go
or not to go should decide immediately. Look,

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:13.370
it’s going to be difficult – last minute
if somebody wants to come it’s impossible.

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:17.970
Last time some people had to walk, because
we cannot have a bus for five people who are

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:22.780
coming late or ten people who are coming late.
So the best thing is you should all decide

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:27.840
those who want to come and should pay your
money and complete the whole thing. Money

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:33.650
should be paid as soon as possible, because
I’ll be going on this Sunday. So it should

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:39.630
be something tomorrow or day after you should
be able to pay all your money. All the leaders

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:44.710
must pay their money and should manage the
show.

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:51.710
Now the marriages’ proposals and all that
we have got already. And all the leaders must

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:58.960
give marriage proposals to Me tomorrow which
we’ll decide here and will finalize it here

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:04.729
as many as possible. And then we have to ask
people. But now one should not be also sort

00:08:04.729 --> 00:08:09.068
of – some people say, “We don’t want
to marry Indians”. Some people say, “We

00:08:09.069 --> 00:08:13.060
don’t want to…” – specially Australians
did say so. But now we discovered that all

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:19.840
Australians were caught up. One person went
who was horrible. All were caught up except

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:26.840
for the Indians. Indians don’t catch. They
don’t catch, they don’t have ego. And

00:08:29.289 --> 00:08:34.708
egos are stupid, idiotic things they do, very
stupid and idiotic things, with ego.

00:08:34.708 --> 00:08:41.708
So that’s what it is, they don’t catch,
they don’t do these things. I mean, they

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:47.100
are consistent. So to say, “We’ll not
have Indians”, it’s another non-sensical

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:50.489
thing. How many Indians could say, “We don’t
want these countries, or that country”,

00:08:50.489 --> 00:08:56.910
but that’s not Sahaj. So one should not
say like that. There’s one thing good about

00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:03.069
them – they never catch. And they don’t
loose their vibrations. We have only one single

00:09:03.069 --> 00:09:10.069
example so far in India who got vibrations
and lost it – one person among all of them.

00:09:15.639 --> 00:09:20.819
So that’s one thing about them, they don’t
loose their vibrations. Maybe somebody who

00:09:20.819 --> 00:09:26.089
has come here might have lost, I don’t know,
but as far as India is concerned one single

00:09:26.089 --> 00:09:31.389
example we know.

00:09:31.389 --> 00:09:35.819
So this is the point one has to remember not
to say, “I don’t want to marry an Indian,

00:09:35.819 --> 00:09:39.290
I don’t want to marry an Egyptian and I
don’t want to marry a certain thing.”

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:44.920
This is not allowed in Sahaja Yoga, we don’t
believe in cast, creed, race or any country.

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:51.420
If you are so conscious about your races you
better give up Sahaja Yoga. It’s a simple

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:58.420
thing as that. Because now it has been shown
clearly that we have false ideas about ourselves.

00:10:00.929 --> 00:10:07.929
So, this is another point that you should
not say, of course – I mean, if you don’t

00:10:07.929 --> 00:10:11.488
want to go out of your country, you can say,
“I don’t want to go out of my country.”

00:10:11.489 --> 00:10:18.489
That’s a different thing. But what is your
country? That means you are not yet in Sahaj.

00:10:24.779 --> 00:10:28.829
If you are in the ocean of Sahaja then you
don’t think – ocean doesn’t say that,

00:10:28.829 --> 00:10:35.349
“This is my shore, that is my shore.”
It’s just an ocean. If you have understood

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:40.470
Sahaj then you must accept Sahaj ways of life.
One of them is we are not to believe in all

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:46.929
this non-sensical ideas of boundaries that
have come to us. You could have been born

00:10:46.929 --> 00:10:52.009
in anywhere. And you are told from childhood
that you are English or you are Indian, you

00:10:52.009 --> 00:10:57.239
are this you are that, it’s all conditioning.
And a very subtle conditioning, we should

00:10:57.239 --> 00:11:03.860
get rid of it. It’s better that we try now
to get rid of it. And if you don’t feel

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:07.579
like marrying you can say that, “We don’t
want to marry.” Nobody is forced in Sahaja

00:11:07.579 --> 00:11:13.258
Yoga, as you know that. You must tell Me beforehand,
no brainwashing, nothing, in all your freedom,

00:11:13.259 --> 00:11:19.509
in all your glory you must say, “Yes”,
otherwise I will not allow you to marry anyone.

00:11:19.509 --> 00:11:24.799
No compulsion of any kind, I have told you
100 times. Nobody is compelled. If you don’t

00:11:24.799 --> 00:11:30.829
want to marry just say, “No”, that’s
all.

00:11:30.829 --> 00:11:37.829
So, after this time the program is all very
fine in Ganapatipule, because I have kept

00:11:40.679 --> 00:11:47.679
two days extra on the 29th, we’ll finish,
but 30th and 31st, two days for all of you

00:11:49.519 --> 00:11:56.439
to go to Alibag. Now, some people, if they
are leaving later on also can stay in Alibag

00:11:56.439 --> 00:12:01.819
for no more payment or anything. And those
who have to leave on the 1st can leave from

00:12:01.819 --> 00:12:06.910
Alibag. So two days we have kept there where
married couples can meet and decide about

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:13.329
things. So it will be time for you to decide
what you want to do and talk to your bride

00:12:13.329 --> 00:12:19.488
or your husband, whatever may be the case.
So that there is no problem on that. And then

00:12:19.489 --> 00:12:23.059
it won’t happen that you just get married
and run away sort of thing won’t happen.

00:12:23.059 --> 00:12:27.339
(Shri Mataji laughing) So you will meet each
other and that will be a nice time to talk

00:12:27.339 --> 00:12:33.730
to each other and find out about others. Now,
any questions? You please ask Me, just now.

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:38.040
About going to India.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:43.199
One more point they were saying that supposing
we come for 10 days or five days, all right,

00:12:43.199 --> 00:12:47.089
it’s all right, can be arrangement, you
have to come on your own, we can’t arrange

00:12:47.089 --> 00:12:51.489
your coming and also the payment part, you
have to pay, because we have to pay wholesale

00:12:51.489 --> 00:12:58.489
price for everything.

00:12:58.639 --> 00:13:05.639
So this time we cannot give concessions of
that kind that we did last time. Because everything

00:13:06.259 --> 00:13:11.420
is now catered, a catering is there, it’s
not done by Sahaja Yoga. So we have to pay

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:18.139
the caterer the money beforehand. And if you
don’t pay, who is going to pay, is the point.

00:13:18.139 --> 00:13:25.139
So, if you can’t pay just don’t come.
If you can pay come along. And the minimum

00:13:28.989 --> 00:13:34.959
of minimum we have tried to keep everything
minimum of minimum. So can you imagine in

00:13:34.959 --> 00:13:41.959
36 pounds you can’t get six saris, six petticoats,
six blouses anywhere. Rommel must be wondering

00:13:44.809 --> 00:13:50.689
how am I going to manage (Shri Mataji laughing)
– it’s impossible, but this has happened.

00:13:50.689 --> 00:13:57.689
You are lucky people. (Shri Mataji laughing)
That’s all I can say.

00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:09.759
So – no question? No questions? No question?

00:14:10.369 --> 00:14:17.369
Marcus? Where are you going to come? Is he
willing to marry?

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:26.470
Anybody who has questions please ask now or
let Me know before

00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:46.189
I leave, all right? Any question.
