00:01.033 --> 00:10.726
1989-07-24 Public Program Day 1 in Vienna 1989

04:08.016 --> 04:11.015
I hope you are enjoying the Indian music.

04:16.324 --> 04:18.487
Now I have asked them to sing a song

04:18.512 --> 04:21.518
which was written in the 12th century

04:21.543 --> 04:23.956
by a very famous poet called Namadeva.

04:33.794 --> 04:37.367
This is a folklore now sung in the villages of India

04:37.400 --> 04:39.158
for all these years

04:39.179 --> 04:44.296
where he has described the joy of Self-realization.

04:54.036 --> 04:57.756
So he says that

04:57.840 --> 05:02.423
“I have given up everything, my anger, my temper”,

05:02.448 --> 05:05.711
all these things which are my relations

05:05.736 --> 05:08.533
because he sings like a lady as if

05:08.558 --> 05:12.689
there’s my husband, my father in law, I have given up everyone.

05:22.866 --> 05:27.658
“But now o Mother Kundalini you be awakened,

05:31.918 --> 05:34.534
and give me” he asked

05:34.575 --> 05:39.021
“oh Mother give me the Yoga” means the union with the Divine.

05:44.450 --> 05:47.623
And that’s how in the village they sing

05:47.654 --> 05:51.102
and sing about getting realization

05:51.108 --> 05:53.175
and raising the Kundalini.

06:00.698 --> 06:04.818
And I hope you’ll clap to them and enjoy.

06:16.643 --> 06:19.656
Some of the Sahaja Yogis can come here,

06:20.410 --> 06:24.250
from Austria and other places to sing..

06:28.330 --> 06:31.496
So this is the folklore and sung

06:31.521 --> 06:35.467
in a rustic way in the villages.

06:45.416 --> 06:47.996
Ambe, Ambe means the Kundalini

06:48.023 --> 06:51.777
and they are singing ude, ude means rise, rise.

07:01.950 --> 07:05.636
[Song – Mother starts talking again at 20.15]

20:16.653 --> 20:20.959
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

20:25.570 --> 20:29.642
At the very outset we have to know

20:29.667 --> 20:34.102
that truth cannot be conceptualised.

20:41.222 --> 20:44.728
It’s not a mental achievement

20:50.795 --> 20:54.587
because human mind has its own limitations

21:00.159 --> 21:03.460
and a breakthrough has to be achieved

21:06.684 --> 21:11.498
by which we become personalities

21:11.907 --> 21:16.321
above mental projections.

21:24.643 --> 21:28.640
When the mental projections we use

21:29.221 --> 21:32.087
they move in a linear directions

21:37.746 --> 21:40.054
and then they recoil

21:40.074 --> 21:42.884
because they cannot sustain themselves

21:48.589 --> 21:53.372
because the mental development or

21:53.656 --> 21:57.773
mental projection does not know how to keep the balance.

22:03.403 --> 22:06.506
For example now you can see

22:06.524 --> 22:10.530
the greenhouse effect as they call it in the west

22:10.555 --> 22:13.880
that is causing so much problems of ecology.

22:21.786 --> 22:24.407
And there are so many other problems

22:24.445 --> 22:28.722
as you can see with all the advanced countries all over.

22:35.118 --> 22:36.977
We have drugs

22:37.244 --> 22:40.218
we have AIDS

22:40.249 --> 22:43.931
all kinds of secret diseases all over.

22:49.747 --> 22:53.606
This is all due to our own mistakes.

22:57.931 --> 23:01.637
But the one who has created this beautiful universe

23:01.654 --> 23:06.726
must have thought of something better.

23:13.742 --> 23:19.702
How will he allow his creation to be destroyed like this?

23:25.778 --> 23:31.877
Now, I have to put before you the

23:34.434 --> 23:38.333
beautiful instrument we have within us

23:38.591 --> 23:42.583
which is going to give us union

23:42.661 --> 23:46.475
with that power which has created us.

24:00.291 --> 24:03.257
This instrument is within us

24:03.324 --> 24:07.800
and this instrument works out this connection

24:07.814 --> 24:12.288
and makes you like a divine computer.

24:20.485 --> 24:28.219
Now you’ll have to take an attitude of a scientist

24:28.570 --> 24:30.829
of an open mind

24:37.047 --> 24:41.448
and whatever I am saying, if it works,

24:41.517 --> 24:45.296
then you have to accept in your honesty.

24:52.280 --> 24:56.753
About this instrument

24:56.811 --> 25:01.325
many people have talked and said,

25:07.480 --> 25:11.452
even when we turn our

25:11.477 --> 25:16.196
attention to religions and to philosophies

25:16.220 --> 25:21.974
we find that all these theories are mental.

25:30.389 --> 25:33.635
Whatever we may follow,

25:33.864 --> 25:39.472
we can do any sin anywhere.

25:45.760 --> 25:52.545
Supposing you´re Hindu, you´re a Christian, you´re a Muslim or any religion,

25:59.470 --> 26:06.898
you can do any sin belonging to any such philosophies.

26:12.732 --> 26:15.419
That means within us

26:16.010 --> 26:25.551
there is no power which controls our abandonment.

26:34.766 --> 26:40.649
Supposing we take to drugs

26:44.413 --> 26:48.111
there´s no power that can bring us back from it.

26:52.976 --> 26:56.375
Supposing you take to immoral life

26:56.393 --> 26:59.719
there is no power that can bring you out,

27:06.510 --> 27:09.243
supposing there is a murderer

27:09.403 --> 27:13.253
he’ll go on murdering, what will stop him?

27:18.458 --> 27:21.397
There is nothing within us

27:21.433 --> 27:26.394
that empowers us to give us wisdom and balance.

27:34.406 --> 27:41.262
So when we see that the essence of all the religions is the same –

27:41.738 --> 27:49.398
that seek the eternal, and is to be treated

27:49.593 --> 27:55.607
as it is in its own understanding and limitations.

28:12.180 --> 28:15.046
So where have we gone wrong

28:15.071 --> 28:18.371
that we not, we did not seek the eternal?

28:22.958 --> 28:26.733
Now if I say that there is a divine power

28:26.755 --> 28:29.941
which is a subtle power which surrounds us

28:29.957 --> 28:34.247
and it does everything, every living work.

28:40.611 --> 28:44.557
We see it every day for example look at these flowers.

28:48.565 --> 28:51.574
We cannot make these flowers.

28:54.532 --> 28:58.748
So many living things we see, flowers becoming fruits,

28:59.115 --> 29:01.661
a seed sprouting into a tree

29:01.925 --> 29:06.157
we just accept it, take it for granted.

29:13.706 --> 29:18.502
We do not want to think how it happens.

29:22.145 --> 29:25.525
Is there some power that does this work?

29:30.381 --> 29:34.079
Now the time has come for all of us to feel that power

29:34.100 --> 29:36.713
and to be in connection with it.

29:42.837 --> 29:47.809
And this instrument within us works it out.

29:53.634 --> 29:56.787
Here in the triangular bone, if you see,

29:56.812 --> 30:01.087
the bone is called as sacrum by the Greeks,

30:01.893 --> 30:03.593
meaning sacred,

30:03.640 --> 30:08.481
lies a power which we in India call as Kundalini.

30:18.360 --> 30:22.897
In the west we have been busy growing outward

30:23.407 --> 30:25.768
like a tree

30:30.941 --> 30:33.622
but if we do not know our roots

30:33.636 --> 30:37.303
this outward growth can be in imbalance

30:37.325 --> 30:42.004
and the day will come when the whole of this will be destroyed.

30:53.092 --> 30:56.149
So we have to have the knowledge of the roots.

30:59.776 --> 31:03.712
So this is the primule

31:03.954 --> 31:08.368
of the seed within us which we call as Kundalini.

31:13.299 --> 31:16.260
In Sahaja Yoga practices if you come

31:16.285 --> 31:19.916
you can see the pulsation of this Kundalini

31:19.924 --> 31:23.727
and can hear with stethoscope very clearly.

31:32.079 --> 31:34.539
In most of the people I have seen –

31:34.541 --> 31:38.331
because there is such an urge to seek the truth –

31:38.356 --> 31:41.175
that Kundalini rises like a jet.

31:50.465 --> 31:54.624
But in some people where there is obstruction

31:54.649 --> 31:57.503
we see the movement is rather slow

31:57.528 --> 32:01.273
and you can feel it with the stethoscope the rising of the Kundalini

32:01.298 --> 32:04.163
even up to the fontanel bone area

32:04.188 --> 32:08.445
you can feel the throbbing like a heart throbbing.

32:21.578 --> 32:24.431
And suddenly you find it stops

32:24.435 --> 32:28.458
and that time you feel the cool breeze coming out of your head.

32:35.399 --> 32:39.568
So this is the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

32:43.030 --> 32:48.302
The power which is all around us is the power of the Holy Ghost

32:52.964 --> 32:58.941
and what you feel on your fingertips is the cool breeze

32:59.118 --> 33:02.746
that is the surrounding Divine Power.

33:09.204 --> 33:14.825
So in your human awareness you develop another higher dimension

33:14.851 --> 33:18.315
which is beyond your mental capacity

33:25.095 --> 33:29.403
and you become, actually it´s a question of becoming not certifying

33:29.428 --> 33:33.699
that you are baptized or anything but actualisation

33:34.710 --> 33:38.824
that you become a realised soul.

33:49.987 --> 33:54.377
This is the last breakthrough we all have to achieve.

33:58.794 --> 34:03.373
In the evolutionary process we have come to the human level

34:03.516 --> 34:07.929
and unless and until we achieve this breakthrough

34:07.949 --> 34:12.817
there is no possibility of saving this universe

34:26.592 --> 34:29.207
because only after this breakthrough

34:29.232 --> 34:33.462
you can feel it that you have become part and parcel of the whole.

34:33.481 --> 34:35.554
It’s an experience.

34:35.572 --> 34:40.479
It’s a feeling within yourself on your fingertips.

34:47.342 --> 34:50.734
Jung has talked about it very clearly

34:53.644 --> 34:57.199
that you can feel your own centres

34:57.281 --> 35:00.649
and you can feel the centres of others.

35:06.307 --> 35:10.657
And all your physical, mental, emotional problems,

35:10.673 --> 35:13.152
even spiritual problems,

35:13.357 --> 35:18.299
you can solve them if you know what´s wrong with you on what centre.

35:27.195 --> 35:30.794
What you need is only the decoding and understanding

35:30.810 --> 35:33.343
as how to solve this problem.

35:39.654 --> 35:43.975
In Sahaja Yoga now we have about thirty nations

35:44.000 --> 35:46.623
who are practising Sahaja Yoga

35:52.774 --> 35:56.454
and it is very gratifying to find

35:56.467 --> 35:59.275
that many people suffering from cancer

35:59.309 --> 36:03.178
and so many incurable diseases have been cured.

36:10.700 --> 36:14.604
They have come out of AIDS and other addictions.

36:18.487 --> 36:21.658
They have become joyous, beautiful people.

36:24.992 --> 36:28.507
They have found out their peace within themselves.

36:31.906 --> 36:34.573
We talk of peace foundations

36:34.600 --> 36:37.659
but those who start the foundations

36:37.680 --> 36:40.083
don´t have any peace within themselves.

36:47.485 --> 36:49.706
Maybe these peace foundations

36:49.727 --> 36:53.488
are preparing for next horrible war perhaps.

36:59.524 --> 37:03.278
But we have to establish the peace within ourselves

37:06.933 --> 37:09.294
which is all there.

37:11.289 --> 37:14.137
But this instrument has no meaning

37:14.184 --> 37:16.781
unless and until it is connected to the mains;

37:16.800 --> 37:21.166
we do have no meaning till we have connected to the mains.

37:30.799 --> 37:34.064
We do not know how great we are.

37:37.117 --> 37:39.952
We do not know what are our potentials.

37:42.800 --> 37:46.234
We do not know what beauty we have within ourselves.

37:49.827 --> 37:52.306
But once this connection is established

37:52.326 --> 37:54.825
you´ll be amazed at yourself.

38:00.314 --> 38:03.454
And you will be surprised how,

38:03.631 --> 38:08.296
how you become so very dynamic

38:08.321 --> 38:11.814
as well as so very compassionate.

38:20.042 --> 38:24.014
There is such a lot can be said about Sahaja Yoga

38:24.080 --> 38:27.213
for I have must have given thousands of lectures

38:27.238 --> 38:30.634
which will be available to you later on.

38:39.512 --> 38:42.587
But as I have said it is all built in within us

38:42.620 --> 38:46.179
like all these lights are built in.

38:53.017 --> 38:55.370
You have to just switch on

38:58.433 --> 39:02.054
and then you can in that light in that enlightenment

39:02.079 --> 39:04.218
you can see for yourself.

39:09.383 --> 39:13.202
So no use arguing, discussing about it.

39:17.476 --> 39:21.340
First you get the light and see in that light.

39:25.934 --> 39:30.917
This is your right to get realisation.

39:36.220 --> 39:40.197
“Sahaja”, “saha” means with “ja” means born,

39:40.266 --> 39:44.123
born with you is the right of this yoga,

39:44.157 --> 39:46.751
means the union with the Divine.

39:56.529 --> 40:00.947
So I think we can just now

40:01.181 --> 40:04.084
have the experience of the Divine.

40:09.047 --> 40:13.548
If you have any questions is better you should write them down

40:13.923 --> 40:18.458
and send them over tomorrow, so in tomorrow´s lecture

40:18.483 --> 40:21.881
I´ll try to answer all your questions.

40:29.133 --> 40:34.098
It will take hardly ten minutes to get this experience of the Divine

40:34.198 --> 40:42.338
but it takes about a month at least to fix the connection, for some people.

40:52.467 --> 40:56.722
So you think we should have the experience first?

41:03.678 --> 41:07.634
Now those who do not want to have realization,

41:07.659 --> 41:09.163
you cannot force it.

41:09.214 --> 41:11.960
It has can be only given in your freedom.

41:20.644 --> 41:24.976
So those who do not want to have should please leave the hall

41:25.045 --> 41:27.517
will be very kind of them.

41:33.964 --> 41:40.323
Tomorrow I´ll explain this instrument in a more clear manner.

41:52.301 --> 41:58.022
So to begin with we have to do some few simple things.

41:58.628 --> 42:01.827
Is to take out your shoes because the Mother earth

42:01.852 --> 42:06.352
helps us a lot for absorbing our problems.

42:23.558 --> 42:25.998
You have to put both your feet

42:26.023 --> 42:29.867
little away from each other because tomorrow I´ll explain to you

42:29.895 --> 42:35.155
how we have got left and right, two powers within us

42:35.180 --> 42:38.408
of left and right sympathetic nervous system.

42:54.592 --> 43:00.201
And then I will also explain to you

43:00.221 --> 43:04.429
how the middle path of our ascent is created.

43:06.408 --> 43:08.814
how the middle path of our ascent is created.

43:16.312 --> 43:20.304
It’s a very beautifully laid down instrument

43:26.068 --> 43:29.457
very delicately, beautifully made.

43:34.304 --> 43:36.757
So, one has to know

43:36.779 --> 43:42.107
that whatever you may think this instrument is quite intact.

43:50.930 --> 43:53.916
But there are two conditions we have to follow.

43:58.002 --> 44:02.394
One is that we have to forget the past.

44:06.361 --> 44:10.382
At this moment we have to forget the past completely.

44:14.480 --> 44:20.897
That means we have to know that we are not guilty,

44:20.904 --> 44:22.897
we have done nothing wrong.

44:28.326 --> 44:32.589
So you are not to feel guilty at all at this moment.

44:36.621 --> 44:39.494
Because feeling guilty is a myth;

44:43.699 --> 44:46.360
because after all you are human beings

44:46.385 --> 44:50.407
and if you have done mistakes, it´s all right.

44:56.275 --> 44:58.522
You are not saints as yet.

45:02.736 --> 45:11.555
And the Divine Power of Love of God is so great

45:11.828 --> 45:17.615
that it has so much power of forgiveness

45:17.640 --> 45:20.483
that everything can be forgiven.

45:28.429 --> 45:33.255
The second condition is that you have to forgive everyone

45:38.555 --> 45:41.421
absolutely to forgive everyone.

45:44.905 --> 45:47.937
You may say it is difficult to forgive

45:52.206 --> 45:55.435
but logically it is a myth.

45:59.947 --> 46:03.328
Whether you forgive or don’t forgive you don’t do anything.

46:07.804 --> 46:10.721
But if you don’t forgive then you play

46:10.746 --> 46:15.851
into your own mental games of torturing yourself

46:22.050 --> 46:24.617
and playing into the wrong hands.

46:27.827 --> 46:30.986
So at this time of resurrection

46:31.150 --> 46:35.900
we have to really know that we don’t have to

46:36.407 --> 46:40.965
think of anyone who might have harmed us.

46:48.783 --> 46:54.162
So, this is a very simple method,

46:54.344 --> 47:00.446
is that I would like you to also know the different centres

47:00.471 --> 47:05.820
which we are going to nourish for our ascent.

47:12.873 --> 47:16.134
So we put our left hand like this

47:16.360 --> 47:20.169
which represents our desire like this,

47:20.175 --> 47:23.668
(call somebody to stand here, can you?)

47:24.814 --> 47:26.671
like this,

47:27.033 --> 47:30.370
to represent ...

47:31.450 --> 47:32.450
like this,

47:32.463 --> 47:37.933
to represent your desire to get your realisation.

47:45.712 --> 47:48.465
Because this is the power of desire.

47:51.830 --> 47:55.930
Now this represents the power of action.

47:59.880 --> 48:02.137
So we have to use the right hand

48:02.162 --> 48:06.046
for nourishing our centres only on the left hand side.

48:11.913 --> 48:15.845
Now first I will show you how we have to touch our centres

48:15.879 --> 48:18.720
and then we’ll have to close our eyes.

48:27.223 --> 48:30.175
So please put your left hand towards me

48:30.195 --> 48:34.047
with the desire that you want your Self-realization.

48:41.960 --> 48:46.688
And first you are to put it on your heart, your right hand.

48:50.980 --> 48:54.432
Because in the heart resides the spirit.

49:02.328 --> 49:05.587
Then if you are the spirit

49:05.600 --> 49:09.572
you are also your own guide, your own master.

49:15.673 --> 49:18.025
So now you have to put your right hand

49:18.052 --> 49:22.051
in the upper part of your abdomen on the left hand side.

49:27.809 --> 49:31.981
And then you have to put your right hand

49:31.995 --> 49:37.611
in the lower part of your abdomen on the left hand side.

49:44.042 --> 49:46.908
This is the centre of pure knowledge

49:46.922 --> 49:50.867
which manifests in your central nervous system.

49:57.563 --> 49:59.837
Then you have to raise your right hand

49:59.862 --> 50:02.963
in the upper part of your abdomen again.

50:07.910 --> 50:09.677
Then on your heart.

50:11.728 --> 50:13.835
Then you have to put your right hand

50:13.860 --> 50:18.759
in the corner of your neck and put your neck to your right.

50:25.279 --> 50:28.991
This centre gets blocked when you feel guilty.

50:33.220 --> 50:35.561
This is a very dangerous blocked

50:35.586 --> 50:40.897
because people get anginas and all kind of Spondylitis.

50:49.277 --> 50:52.790
Then you have to raise your hand to your forehead

50:52.810 --> 50:54.397
across you have to put it

50:54.418 --> 50:57.085
and slowly put down your head

50:57.099 --> 50:59.659
and press it on both the sides.

51:09.187 --> 51:11.819
Now, please take back your right hand

51:11.844 --> 51:14.119
on the back side of your head

51:18.108 --> 51:21.569
and push back your head, slowly.

51:25.864 --> 51:27.881
Let it rest on your hand.

51:31.320 --> 51:36.336
Now, the centre in front was the centre of forgiveness

51:36.361 --> 51:39.793
and this is the centre on the back is

51:39.795 --> 51:43.797
the part of the same centre is for asking forgiveness.

51:55.182 --> 51:59.543
But here you don´t have to feel guilty  or don’t have to count your mistakes.

52:04.570 --> 52:09.575
Now stretch your hand and put the centre of your palm

52:09.591 --> 52:13.987
on top of your fontanel bone area

52:13.995 --> 52:17.833
which was a soft bone in your childhood, like this.

52:25.498 --> 52:30.685
Now, push back your fingers and press it hard.

52:30.993 --> 52:33.732
Here you have to do it carefully.

52:33.757 --> 52:40.480
You move your scalp with a pressure seven times, clockwise.

53:00.616 --> 53:02.740
That’s all we have to do.

53:05.030 --> 53:09.258
Now again I would like to request you

53:09.313 --> 53:13.037
that there is nothing to be very serious about it.

53:19.370 --> 53:21.603
It’s a spontaneous happening.

53:24.122 --> 53:26.142
You open your hearts

53:28.232 --> 53:31.127
and be pleasantly placed towards yourself.

53:35.497 --> 53:38.351
You have to enter into kingdom of God

53:41.483 --> 53:46.147
and you should be really very happy to do that.

53:51.176 --> 53:54.153
So now we close our eyes

53:54.194 --> 53:58.019
and you can take out your spectacles if you want

53:58.044 --> 54:01.609
and we don’t open them till I tell you.

54:10.953 --> 54:15.056
Keep both feet apart and the left hand towards me.

54:22.185 --> 54:24.538
Now close your eyes.

54:27.177 --> 54:29.830
Put your right hand on your heart.

54:33.138 --> 54:35.479
Here you ask me a question.

54:35.513 --> 54:39.100
You can call me Shri Mataji or you can call me Mother,

54:39.125 --> 54:40.882
whatever you like.

54:48.739 --> 54:53.736
So please ask three times “Mother am I the spirit?”

54:53.761 --> 54:56.053
Ask this fundamental question.

55:10.566 --> 55:15.012
Now, you have to know that if you are the spirit,

55:15.023 --> 55:17.289
you are your master.

55:24.025 --> 55:28.392
Because the spirit is the source of all the knowledge,

55:28.434 --> 55:31.714
joy and attention.

55:38.405 --> 55:40.871
I mean the divine attention.

55:44.257 --> 55:48.946
Now, take down your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen

55:55.803 --> 55:57.426
and press it hard.

56:00.218 --> 56:03.786
Here you have to ask another question.

56:04.010 --> 56:07.298
“Mother am I my own master,

56:07.360 --> 56:11.020
am I my own guru?” Ask this question three times!

56:22.685 --> 56:33.644
Now, the centre of pure knowledge is to be nourished

56:33.669 --> 56:38.363
but I cannot force pure knowledge on you.

56:46.502 --> 56:49.242
You have to ask for it

56:49.702 --> 56:54.811
in your own freedom and glory.

57:00.971 --> 57:06.032
So please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen.

57:11.610 --> 57:16.051
And here you have to say

57:16.740 --> 57:23.280
“Mataji, Shri Mataji, please give me my,

57:24.275 --> 57:27.715
please give me pure knowledge”.

57:34.500 --> 57:39.482
Say it six times because this centre has got six petals.

57:52.807 --> 58:01.951
As soon as you ask for your pure knowledge

58:02.340 --> 58:05.330
then the Kundalini starts moving.

58:12.879 --> 58:18.493
So we have to help her rise by nourishing the upper centres.

58:25.700 --> 58:28.470
So now raise your right hand

58:28.927 --> 58:32.840
in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side.

58:39.849 --> 58:44.827
Here you have to say

58:45.811 --> 58:48.751
with full confidence

58:50.932 --> 58:56.022
“Mother, I am my own master!”

59:04.231 --> 59:06.567
Please say it ten times,

59:09.565 --> 59:11.452
with full confidence.

59:16.080 --> 59:20.779
“Mother, I am my own master!”

59:27.277 --> 59:32.229
You have to know that you are not this body,

59:32.520 --> 59:35.046
you are not this mind,

59:35.161 --> 59:37.847
you are not this intellect.

59:44.927 --> 59:47.742
You are not your emotions,

59:47.767 --> 59:51.250
your conditionings or your ego.

59:59.239 --> 01:00:02.567
But you are pure spirit.

01:00:05.808 --> 01:00:08.587
So raise your hand to your heart

01:00:08.612 --> 01:00:13.827
and say the most fundamental truth twelve times

01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:18.655
“Mother I am the spirit”.

01:00:37.412 --> 01:00:42.381
Now, I have told you

01:00:42.870 --> 01:00:45.923
that you have to forgive yourself

01:00:53.960 --> 01:01:02.129
because the Divine Power is the ocean of compassion and love.

01:01:08.718 --> 01:01:12.439
It is the ocean of joy and bliss.

01:01:16.327 --> 01:01:18.720
But above all,

01:01:19.208 --> 01:01:22.278
it is the ocean of forgiveness

01:01:27.055 --> 01:01:29.587
and you cannot commit any mistake

01:01:29.601 --> 01:01:33.102
which cannot be dissolved by this ocean.

01:01:40.882 --> 01:01:47.357
So now please put your right hand on your forehead across

01:01:47.382 --> 01:01:50.821
and put your head slowly down.

01:01:58.772 --> 01:02:01.005
Press on both the sides.

01:02:04.009 --> 01:02:06.948
And here you have to say,

01:02:06.997 --> 01:02:09.758
“Mother, I forgive everyone”

01:02:09.789 --> 01:02:13.058
Say it from heart, from your heart.

01:02:13.152 --> 01:02:17.547
Please say it in the heart with full sincerity

01:02:17.584 --> 01:02:20.930
“Mother I forgive everyone”

01:02:35.259 --> 01:02:37.240
Please sincerely say it!

01:02:43.456 --> 01:02:47.802
Now, take back your hand on the back side of your head .

01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:55.306
And push back your head on it.

01:02:58.548 --> 01:03:07.381
Here, you have to say without feeling guilty

01:03:14.128 --> 01:03:18.171
“O Divine, if I have done any mistakes, please forgive me”

01:03:18.186 --> 01:03:20.739
but don’t count your mistakes.

01:03:29.947 --> 01:03:33.746
Say it from your heart.

01:03:41.801 --> 01:03:46.884
Now, stretch your hand,

01:03:50.601 --> 01:03:53.900
put the centre of your palm

01:03:53.925 --> 01:03:59.774
on top of the fontanel bone area on the soft bone.

01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:08.849
Push back your fingers.

01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:16.080
Here again I cannot force on you Self-realization.

01:04:21.283 --> 01:04:23.140
You have to ask for it.

01:04:25.249 --> 01:04:27.537
So please say seven times

01:04:27.543 --> 01:04:31.642
while moving your hand clockwise slowly with a pressure,

01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:34.624
seven times, please say

01:04:35.123 --> 01:04:38.889
“Mother please give me my Self-realization!”

01:04:48.694 --> 01:04:51.872
Press it hard, push back your fingers.

01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:45.201
Please take down your hands.

01:05:48.590 --> 01:05:50.330
Please open your eyes.

01:05:53.553 --> 01:05:56.080
Now put the right hand towards me

01:05:59.834 --> 01:06:02.092
and bend your head

01:06:04.213 --> 01:06:08.907
and put the left hand on above your head

01:06:08.932 --> 01:06:10.339
and see for yourself

01:06:10.346 --> 01:06:15.318
if there’s a cool breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area.

01:06:24.186 --> 01:06:27.392
Some people get it very much higher,

01:06:27.408 --> 01:06:30.589
some get it closer but it should be above.

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:41.428
Now, please put the left hand towards me

01:06:45.255 --> 01:06:48.933
and bend your head again and see with the right hand.

01:06:59.314 --> 01:07:02.942
Once again, you put your right hand towards me

01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:09.428
and please put your left hand

01:07:12.777 --> 01:07:14.556
to feel it.

01:07:19.325 --> 01:07:25.529
All of you please put your hands up like this

01:07:25.893 --> 01:07:30.865
and put your head up and ask me a question.

01:07:39.191 --> 01:07:42.430
“Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost”

01:07:42.453 --> 01:07:47.917
or “Mother is this the all-pervading Power of God’s love”

01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:50.958
or “Mother is this the Parama Chaitanya”.

01:07:50.972 --> 01:07:55.800
Ask anyone of these questions three times in your heart.

01:08:12.370 --> 01:08:13.776
Three times;

01:08:20.256 --> 01:08:23.956
now, take down your hands.

01:08:28.878 --> 01:08:31.491
Watch me without thinking.

01:08:36.789 --> 01:08:42.422
Now those who have felt the cool breeze out of their head

01:08:42.904 --> 01:08:46.371
or in their hands

01:08:46.538 --> 01:08:50.552
please raise  both the hands.

01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:04.706
Oh God, tremendous.

01:09:09.192 --> 01:09:10.966
May God bless you!

01:09:13.914 --> 01:09:17.100
Now most of you have felt it.

01:09:20.581 --> 01:09:22.760
Some of you have not.

01:09:25.369 --> 01:09:29.656
But there is nothing to feel bad about it.

01:09:33.757 --> 01:09:35.689
You will feel it.

01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:42.152
Tomorrow again, I hope you will all come

01:09:42.675 --> 01:09:47.955
and you will not think about it.

01:09:54.011 --> 01:09:56.326
Do not argue about it.

01:09:58.356 --> 01:10:02.202
Otherwise you will lose it a little bit.

01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:11.810
So just silently you go home

01:10:11.872 --> 01:10:13.812
and keep the silence,

01:10:13.834 --> 01:10:18.055
enjoy it and come back tomorrow.

01:10:24.773 --> 01:10:29.898
I assure you, all of you are going to fix it up tomorrow.

01:10:35.897 --> 01:10:39.422
Tell your friends, telephone to them, call them

01:10:39.450 --> 01:10:43.177
and this is the best thing you can give it to them.

01:10:50.257 --> 01:10:51.736
Thank you very much.

01:10:53.437 --> 01:10:54.833
May God bless you!

01:11:50.001 --> 01:11:52.274
Now, if you want to meet Me,

01:11:52.299 --> 01:11:54.676
I would like to shake hands with you all

01:11:54.690 --> 01:11:56.524
and I’ll be very happy to do that.
