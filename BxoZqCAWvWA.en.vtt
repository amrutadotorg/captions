00:00:16.397 --> 00:00:20.537
Whatever you do, it should please Me
is one of the ways.

00:00:20.738 --> 00:00:24.053
It should please Me;

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:32.123
that’s one of the signs. So how do we do it?

00:00:32.324 --> 00:00:36.916
Put Me in your heart. Just try to put Me 
in your heart;

00:00:37.117 --> 00:00:43.316
is very simple. I am before you now. 
I am in Person.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:51.473
I was trying to give Realization to one
of My relations just today,

00:00:51.674 --> 00:00:53.387
and I said that, “You don’t close your
eyes.”

00:00:53.588 --> 00:00:56.762
He said, “No. I’m not looking at Your Face,

00:00:56.963 --> 00:01:01.661
because when I see You I feel You are
my aunt,

00:01:01.862 --> 00:01:04.043
but I am just looking at Your Feet

00:01:04.244 --> 00:01:09.340
so that I shouldn’t feel anymore that
You are my aunt.

00:01:09.541 --> 00:01:15.240
You are very great, and Your Face is
the one that puts me into illusions.”

00:01:15.441 --> 00:01:19.880
He could see it’s a Mahamaya. He said,
“Only at Your Feet I look,

00:01:20.081 --> 00:01:25.240
and through Your Feet only I can get over
this barrier, this feeling.”

00:01:25.441 --> 00:01:32.107
In the same way when I’m a Mahamaya,
I know I am; I had to be,

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:42.209
but you have to put My Feet into
your heart,

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:53.154
just My feet into your heart,

00:01:53.807 --> 00:02:00.992
because photo, face, everything, might be
an illusion.

00:02:02.205 --> 00:02:11.060
Might be by seeing My Face you do not
get over your barriers.

00:02:14.956 --> 00:02:19.225
To say: “I must see Mother, I must do this,

00:02:19.426 --> 00:02:23.240
Mother must come to my house, She must
have food at my place,

00:02:23.441 --> 00:02:26.617
She must visit my home,” all this is
so stupid.

00:02:26.818 --> 00:02:31.482
I cannot understand. What’s the matter
with these people?

00:02:36.621 --> 00:02:38.670
“Mother please come in my heart.

00:02:38.871 --> 00:02:41.927
Let me clean my heart so that You are
there.

00:02:42.128 --> 00:02:46.318
Put Your Feet into my heart.

00:02:47.465 --> 00:02:52.342
Let Your Feet be worshipped in my heart.

00:02:52.786 --> 00:02:56.586
Let me not be in delusion.

00:02:56.787 --> 00:03:00.195
Take me away from illusions.

00:03:00.396 --> 00:03:02.879
Keep me in reality.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.965
Take away the sheen of superficiality.

00:03:08.166 --> 00:03:11.996
Let me enjoy Your Feet in my heart.

00:03:12.197 --> 00:03:16.943
Let me see Your Feet in my heart.”

00:03:17.666 --> 00:03:20.701
Only such people -

00:03:21.346 --> 00:03:24.277
even Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha have
done that,

00:03:24.478 --> 00:03:28.185
so don’t you think you have to do it?

00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:33.357
So humble down yourself.

00:03:33.558 --> 00:03:39.591
Humble down yourself in your heart.
Humble down in your heart.

00:03:39.792 --> 00:03:44.185
Enjoy your humility. Enjoy your virtues.

00:03:44.386 --> 00:03:49.576
The greatest virtue of a Sahaja Yogi
is humility.

00:03:50.324 --> 00:03:55.966
Now so many things you have seen
to convince you,

00:03:56.167 --> 00:04:01.568
but in no way it can mean any kind
of subjection,

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:06.935
because what subjection you can give Me?
Think of that.

00:04:08.417 --> 00:04:15.006
When every subjection is a blessing,
what subjection you are giving Me?

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:20.728
Every feeling in the heart is a blessing.

00:04:20.929 --> 00:04:29.846
Just, just now you feel it, and you feel
the joy in your heart.

00:04:30.701 --> 00:04:34.204
Then what is your subjection, about what?

00:04:34.405 --> 00:04:39.066
I can understand people who are just newly
come, who are good for nothing, just,

00:04:39.267 --> 00:04:41.653
but you are not on the periphery.

00:04:41.854 --> 00:04:45.441
But some of them do go into periphery
in no time.

00:04:45.642 --> 00:04:49.934
You give them some work - finished.
If I am sweet to someone - finished.

00:04:50.135 --> 00:04:53.481
If I see someone - finished. I mean this is
too much;

00:04:53.682 --> 00:04:57.584
I can’t even be nice to you.

00:05:05.016 --> 00:05:11.880
If you do any mistakes or anything then
you feel, then you get your left Vishuddi.

00:05:12.081 --> 00:05:14.826
You’ve done your mistake, all right,
finished.

00:05:15.027 --> 00:05:17.818
You love Me, maybe there’s something
wrong in the love,

00:05:18.019 --> 00:05:19.810
or maybe something has happened; doesn’t
matter.

00:05:20.011 --> 00:05:26.216
“Now, I’m going to be cautious. I’m not
going to make any mistakes.

00:05:26.417 --> 00:05:31.076
How could I do this mistake? Because
I was not fully in love.

00:05:31.277 --> 00:05:34.357
If I had loved something I would have
not done such a mistake.”

00:05:34.558 --> 00:05:37.123
All right, so develop your love.

00:05:37.324 --> 00:05:43.216
No. You will do, “I feel guilty, because 
I’ve done such a thing,”

00:05:44.517 --> 00:05:46.109
so you miss this and that both.

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.224
So your mistake becomes a barrier again.

00:05:49.425 --> 00:05:52.375
Don’t feel guilty about it. We have
to progress further.

00:05:52.576 --> 00:05:55.039
Forget the past. Forget the past. Forget
the past.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.678
We have to go further. We have to be
serious people.

00:06:01.523 --> 00:06:07.795
When we talk, we should talk with that
dignity of that awe.

00:06:10.703 --> 00:06:14.055
That’s very important, and once you develop
that awe

00:06:14.256 --> 00:06:17.777
your Ekadasha will disappear.

00:06:19.907 --> 00:06:24.998
Ekadasha will disappear; just think
of the awe.

00:06:33.929 --> 00:06:41.831
See the silence and the joy, and the joy
of the awe

00:06:42.032 --> 00:06:46.498
is deep, very deep like a sea.

00:06:47.249 --> 00:06:52.789
Sea on superficial level is very turbulent,
but inside it’s silent,

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:56.478
absolutely silent. Feel that depth.

00:06:56.679 --> 00:07:00.959
Without awe you cannot go down.
