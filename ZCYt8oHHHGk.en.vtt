00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:18.360
Today's puja is very important for us. You
all have got your Self Realization. You have

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:32.029
all the knowledge that is necessary to give
Realizations to others. You have to know what

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:41.870
you have already. That's very important, because
if you do not try your hand and if you do

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.730
not try to give Realizations to others, firstly
you'll have no faith in yourself. You'll have

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.060
no self-esteem also.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:06.060
The second part is that you try giving vibrations
to other persons, but don't get involved with

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.950
that person. I've seen some people get too
much involved. If they give Realization to

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:23.140
one person, they think they have done a great
job and they start working on that person,

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:30.140
his family, his relations, this thing. So,
so far as you must have learned, that one

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:38.010
may be related, one may be closer to one person,
but not necessarily he will have that much

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:45.900
of chance of Self Realization. Only way to
grow is to be collective. There's no other

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:00.810
way out. If people think that by staying away
from ashrams, alone living somewhere they

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.759
will achieve much - that's not the way Sahaja
Yoga is meant.

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:14.759
Formerly, people used to go to Himalayas and
most of them were separated and only one or

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:23.390
two persons were chosen for spiritual growth.
Here it is not question of spiritual growth,

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:31.530
it's a question of your collectivity growing
in you. That is how you become a person who

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:41.860
is collective, who enjoys collective, who
works on collective and lives with collective.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:51.200
Such a person develops new kind of powers.
And these powers are such that they are very

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:07.500
subtle, but they penetrate into any molecule,
atom or human beings, anywhere. And their

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:19.370
penetration is only possible if you have a
temperament which is collective. Without being

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:27.260
fully collective, you cannot achieve that
height which is very necessary today for Sahaja

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:32.430
Yoga.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:39.430
As you know, there are problems and problems
all over, as if you feel that the world is

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:47.409
going to sink. Specially when I went to America
I felt that "My goodness, this is a hell that

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:54.209
they have created here." Is just a hell because
they have no dharma, they don't believe in

00:03:54.209 --> 00:04:01.209
any dharma, completely they worship adharma
and this kind of climate is flowing all over.

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:10.959
All over the world, you get reaction of American
adharmic life. And people think there's nothing

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:19.680
wrong in it. Whatever you may tell them, they
will not believe nor they will think that

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:26.720
there's any verdict. But they don't see the
destruction from the very basis of their life,

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:33.720
their families, their societies. The whole
country, I feel, is filled with such ugly

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:44.699
type of adharmic nature, that one cannot even
imagine how such ideas came into their heads.

00:04:49.119 --> 00:04:54.639
And these ideas I need not tell you, you know
them very well. But if you have to save your

00:04:54.639 --> 00:05:01.639
children, you have to be an ideal guru yourself.
If you just talk of Sahaja Yoga and if you

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:12.289
try to assume that you are a Sahaja Yogi,
also you try to propagate Sahaja Yoga without

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:20.800
all these powers being awakened in you, it
would be a failure. So, how to develop these

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:28.069
powers within us we should see.

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:35.069
It's rather embarrassing for Me to tell you
how you have to behave towards your Guru.

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:42.069
I think people have told you. But naturally,
spontaneously, as soon as you get your Realization

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:49.469
and grow in it, naturally you develop a very
humble attitude. Also an attitude through

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:59.180
which you achieve lots of 
qualities of your Guru. Now, supposing the
Guru is at a particular height and if you

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:16.610
try to go on to the same height, nothing will
move towards you. So you must sit at a place

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:26.379
which is much lower than the Guru's is. Some
people take too much advantage of My good

00:06:28.149 --> 00:06:33.309
nature, I should say, and so many people have
pointed out to Me that "You must correct these

00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:37.669
people, they talk to You at equal level and
all that." I said: "They will learn a lesson,

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:44.249
they will learn a lesson." But sometimes,
it doesn't work out and they start talking

00:06:44.249 --> 00:06:51.249
on the same manner as if you are talking to
your friend or to your equal.

00:06:51.869 --> 00:06:57.099
First is complete humility. You have to be
a humble person, extremely humble. Now, you

00:06:57.099 --> 00:07:04.099
check on that, when you talk to others, are
you humble? When you think of others, are

00:07:11.089 --> 00:07:18.089
you humble? When you look after your wife
and children, are you humble? That's a very

00:07:20.999 --> 00:07:27.999
important thing for every person who thinks
he is a Guru. Humility is the first quality

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:40.020
or, I should say, the ocean into which you
must jump. Some people think that "If you

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:46.610
are humble, Mother, then people will take
advantage of you." Nobody can take advantage

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:53.520
of you, because you have to remember another
point, that you are protected all the time,

00:07:53.520 --> 00:08:00.520
looked after by Param Chaitanya. I know you
know that, but how many really believe that

00:08:01.159 --> 00:08:05.779
there is Param Chaitanya with us?

00:08:05.779 --> 00:08:12.779
If you really believe that there is Param
Chaitanya, then you don't get frightened,

00:08:14.849 --> 00:08:21.849
you don't get worried, you are not subjected
to all kinds of nonsensical ideas also. But

00:08:22.809 --> 00:08:29.809
if you think that you are not protected, "What
will happen? How will things happen?" then

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:37.360
Param Chaitanya leaves you alone. You have
to see the whole drama, how Param Chaitanya

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:49.740
works out, how It works out, how you are behaving.
Supposing you are not in a proper shape and

00:08:57.459 --> 00:09:04.459
you try to show off too much, then what happens?
Then, you get the reward for it. Not that

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:13.120
I do anything, but it is the Param Chaitanya
which will teach you a lesson that you will

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:18.740
remember, that you should have been little
different from what you have been. After all,

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:25.740
we have to know why have we come to Sahaja
Yoga. Begin at the root of it. We have come

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:33.160
to Sahaja Yoga because we wanted to know the
absolute truth, and this absolute truth has

00:09:33.519 --> 00:09:40.519
been now known to you through your vibrations.
You know it through your vibrations, what

00:09:41.089 --> 00:09:48.089
is the absolute truth, and you should work
everything on that line, that absolute truth,

00:09:54.870 --> 00:10:00.560
whatever you feel on your vibrations you have
to follow.

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:06.540
Unfortunately, I have seen many people think
that their vibrations are all right, they

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:11.920
are all right and whatever they are receiving
on their vibrations is first class. Now, how

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:18.620
to correct that point is very difficult. It
comes from ego. When you have ego, you can

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:25.189
never find anything wrong with you. And even
if the vibrations are telling you something,

00:10:25.189 --> 00:10:29.120
it might be somebody else who is telling you
something, because you are not there, your

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:36.120
ego is there and your ego is just spoiling
you and teaching you things which normally

00:10:39.519 --> 00:10:44.850
you would see clearly that "I'm doing something
wrong, I should not have done it."

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:51.850
In this process of correction and improvement,
when you indulge you should see: "Are you

00:10:55.439 --> 00:11:01.720
getting subtler or grosser?" That is the best
way to judge. Now, I've seen people who go

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:08.720
on judging on small things like vibrations
- whether this vibration are all right or

00:11:11.939 --> 00:11:18.939
not in this tree or on this flowers or on
this land, all kinds of material things they

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:26.480
want to see the vibrations. But for what are
you seeing the vibration? You are seeing vibration

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:33.480
because some sort of material gain. You think
that if you check the vibrations and the vibrations

00:11:34.769 --> 00:11:41.769
are all right, then you are quite safe, you
will not loose this, will not loose that.

00:11:41.939 --> 00:11:48.939
It's not true. Because vibrations are not
meant to judge all these worldly things and

00:11:49.209 --> 00:11:56.209
worldly matters. It's absolutely cheapening
the vibrations. You should not cheapen them,

00:11:57.939 --> 00:12:04.939
because vibrations can suggest things which
may be detrimental to your growth very much.

00:12:05.189 --> 00:12:11.180
Once, I wanted somebody to go somewhere, so
he said, "I didn't go, Mother."

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:12.019
I said, "Why?"

00:12:12.019 --> 00:12:14.620
"Because I saw the vibrations were very bad."

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:21.620
I said, "That's why I asked you to go. If
the vibrations were good, what was your use

00:12:24.449 --> 00:12:29.899
going there? That's the reason I asked you
to go there so that you could help but before

00:12:29.899 --> 00:12:34.990
that you judged yourself, judged your vibrations
and then you didn't want to go."

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:41.990
So, what happens, we want to have a easy,
cozy life. And all our problems must be solved

00:12:43.499 --> 00:12:49.649
by Sahaja Yoga, otherwise we think Sahaja
Yoga is of no use. Whatever is our desire

00:12:49.649 --> 00:12:56.649
must be fulfilled. So, now the desires are
mostly personal. "My child is not well, so

00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:02.209
the child should be all right, my husband
is misbehaving, the husband should be all

00:13:02.209 --> 00:13:09.209
right" or "I have no house, I must get a house."
See how we are moving our mind, is still on

00:13:11.689 --> 00:13:18.639
a very consumer society, as they call it.
We are all the time thinking, "Now I should

00:13:18.639 --> 00:13:25.639
have a son, now, instead of a girl" and you
get a son and then you blame Sahaja Yoga for

00:13:27.019 --> 00:13:33.860
that! Anything that according to your desire
doesn't work out, then you think it's Sahaja

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:38.860
Yoga which has done the harm and you are suffering
because of Sahaja Yoga. Or this faith in Sahaja

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:45.860
Yoga gets little moving or we can say, in
a way, it's not that deep. But if you are

00:13:48.769 --> 00:13:55.769
deeply imbedded in Sahaja Yoga, then what
happens? "What may come, I will be a Sahaja

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:03.610
Yogi."

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:10.100
Supposing somebody dies, normally in Sahaja
Yoga it's difficult for people to die also,

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:17.100
I must tell you. Even if they want to die,
they can't die. It's the Param Chaitanya which

00:14:17.309 --> 00:14:24.089
decides for you. But supposing you take up
a position like that, still you must know

00:14:24.089 --> 00:14:31.089
that that wish may not be fulfilled. If that
is not fulfilled then you feel disturbed and

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:41.980
you think, "What's wrong?" But your wish is
not the wish of God Almighty, while Param

00:14:48.379 --> 00:14:55.379
Chaitanya is the wish of God Almighty.

00:14:56.699 --> 00:15:01.209
Now for example I went to America, take it
like this, and America attacked Me. Negativity

00:15:01.209 --> 00:15:08.209
and troubled Me. For all these days I'm suffering
so-called, and I have had pain, I have had

00:15:12.639 --> 00:15:19.639
all kinds of things. But that I had to do
because now the American Sahaja Yogis will

00:15:19.639 --> 00:15:26.639
realize how much one has to pay to make this
dumb head of Americans to rise. How stupid

00:15:31.249 --> 00:15:38.249
they are and how foolish they are who are
enamored by people who are taking money!

00:15:42.079 --> 00:15:49.079
So many people came to Me and told Me, "Mother,
if You start saying that, this I can give

00:15:49.779 --> 00:15:56.779
for 300 dollars, You'll get thousands and
thousands of disciples of Yours."

00:15:56.829 --> 00:16:03.779
I said, "They'll not be My disciples. If they
come for money, thinking that because I'm

00:16:03.779 --> 00:16:10.779
taking money it is worthy something, that
means they are absolutely stupid!" Sahaja

00:16:11.569 --> 00:16:16.499
Yoga, you cannot get it by money, this is
the first principle they don't understand,

00:16:16.499 --> 00:16:23.499
most of them! Most of them don't understand
that you can get Self Realization without

00:16:24.589 --> 00:16:27.029
paying any money.

00:16:27.029 --> 00:16:34.029
They were some Gujarati rich people in New
Jersey and they asked questions to Sahaja

00:16:36.509 --> 00:16:43.509
Yogis that "How is it possible to get it so
easily? It's not possible because it's a very

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:48.439
difficult thing, all the shastras have said,
everybody has said, it's very difficult to

00:16:48.439 --> 00:16:55.439
get your Realization. All right! If so, how
is it you are giving it so easily? Why?" Nobody

00:16:57.379 --> 00:17:04.379
knew how to answer to these people. You should
have said like this, "All right it is difficult,

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:09.640
very difficult and you cannot give mass, true!
But if somebody is doing it, then you have

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:13.949
to think about it, how somebody is doing it?"

00:17:13.949 --> 00:17:19.610
So, this kind of stupid questions are there
and still if they go on, you have really to

00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:26.610
tell them in a very humble way: "Sir, one
has to be worthy also." So, they will run

00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:32.690
after people who are just making money out
of them, making fool out of them. And they

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:39.470
boast, "We have three gurus." Somebody says,
"We have seven gurus!" And I wonder what must

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:45.110
be their condition. So the people who are extremly  stupid, in Sanskrit they call "Mudha"

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:52.110
people who are brainless
cannot get their Realization, so give them

00:17:53.350 --> 00:18:00.350
up. If they are arguing with you, you just
give them up. It's not their right to argue

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:09.500
with you. Their right is to get Realization
but not a right to argue with you, ask you

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:15.710
foolish questions and stupid questions. But
you should always remember that with that

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:21.789
humility you must have your dignity intact
because you are a Guru. Once you know you

00:18:21.789 --> 00:18:28.789
are a Guru, one thing should be there that
you will not behave like a joker all the time.

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:36.720
Your behavior will be dignified. At the same
time, it will be very pleasant face or a pleasant

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:45.169
personality. It won't be annoying type. Your
personality itself will suggest that there's

00:18:45.169 --> 00:18:46.840
something special about you.

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:53.840
Now, how do you develop that kind of a personality?
The biggest problem in the West is ego and

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:11.049
the biggest problem in the East is superego.
Now, this ego business, I don't know from

00:19:11.049 --> 00:19:18.029
where it has come. In all walk of life, they
show how egoistical they are.

00:19:18.029 --> 00:19:25.029
For example, I went to America and I was surprised
that there is a racial problem, and the blacks

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:31.210
are treated in a different manner, and the
whites in a different manner. I mean, color

00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:37.149
is given by God and somebody has to be black,
and white. If everybody looked the same, it

00:19:37.149 --> 00:19:44.149
will look like a regiment. There should be
some variety, there should be some change

00:19:46.309 --> 00:19:53.309
in the face and also in the expression. One
has to be a person carrying better or different

00:19:56.799 --> 00:20:03.799
expressions, otherwise you will be bored with
such a world where there is everybody looks

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:11.380
the same, just the same. But so much of racialism
there that I was surprised that how it has

00:20:12.779 --> 00:20:15.120
worked into human mind.

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:22.120
So, as a Guru, you must develop a complete
detest for racialism, complete detest. That's

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:31.980
very easy to understand that anybody who has
fair complexion could be a cruelest man, cruelest

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:40.720
woman and could be a cruelest mother also.
And the one who is black could be very kind,

00:20:43.429 --> 00:20:50.429
generous. It doesn't go with the color, temperament
doesn't go with the color. But because the

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:58.890
blacks have been ill-treated so much that
they react. And they react, naturally, in

00:20:59.279 --> 00:21:06.279
sometimes in such a manner that it is very
crude and very cruel. But this kind of attention,

00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:17.970
this kind of a, you can say, a wrong type
of attitude towards human beings, even towards

00:21:19.279 --> 00:21:25.510
animals they won't bear it. So towards human
beings to have such an attitude itself shows

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:32.510
that you are not worthy of Sahaja Yoga at
all. So anyone of you who has such a feeling

00:21:36.299 --> 00:21:43.299
that somebody is black and somebody is white
cannot be a guru in Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:54.220
Then in India we have caste system, equally
bad and horrible. It has no sense in it, no

00:21:56.490 --> 00:22:02.179
basis whatsoever, but in India we have people
who believe that some castes are higher and

00:22:02.179 --> 00:22:09.070
some castes are lower. Every caste people
can do all the worst possible things, there

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:16.070
is no demarcation for them and every low caste
can be very, very good. We have had many great

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:26.840
poets and Sufis in the lowest castes in India.
This castes are man-made. You know man-made

00:22:27.679 --> 00:22:34.679
cloth doesn't suit us, and all these man-made
ideas are not going to suit us and it will

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:41.750
lead us into a great - I wouldn't know discretion
- but I would say to a complete destruction,

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:55.320
because hatred begets hatred and it goes on
increasing and increasing. If you cannot get

00:22:55.320 --> 00:23:00.260
rid of your hatred, then, I would say you
are not a Sahaja Yogi.

00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:07.260
These are all conditionings. You were born
in a white family, so you are white, you were

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:16.679
born in a Christian family that's why you
are Christian, you were born in a Jew family,

00:23:16.679 --> 00:23:20.570
that's why you are a Jew. All this is just
because you were born in that. But does that

00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:27.570
mean that you are higher or lower? All the
problems of the world today, if you see, are

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:36.110
because of human attachment to nonsensical
ideas of superiority. Only through collective

00:23:38.399 --> 00:23:45.399
living will change. For example, I would say,
in an ashram, we should have all colored people

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:55.960
living together with the equal rights, with
the equal understanding and love and affection.

00:23:58.029 --> 00:24:05.029
If that is not there, no use calling it an
ashram.

00:24:12.019 --> 00:24:19.019
Once, they asked Me, "Mother, will You come
and give a lecture in Harlem?"

00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:20.630
I said, "Why not?"

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:24.779
So some Sahaja Yogis said, "Harlem? Mother,
do You know what is Harlem?"

00:24:24.779 --> 00:24:26.860
I said, "I know. There's no harm."

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:30.130
They said, "You know the blacks are there
and..."

00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:37.130
I said, "I'm also black." You could call Me
black or you can call Me white, but the love

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:46.700
is such a thing, you see, love is such a thing
that cleanses all these ridiculous ideas we

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:53.700
have about other people. To brand anyone as
black and white shows that you have no eyes

00:24:54.940 --> 00:25:01.940
to see. Any person with depth, any person
with loving heart cannot see these superficial

00:25:08.039 --> 00:25:11.480
things, cannot see!

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:18.480
Today is a day where we are celebrating the
Guru's greatness. Now, look at all the Gurus,

00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:29.190
how they were, how they behaved. We have many
in India and many others many Sufis in other

00:25:34.049 --> 00:25:41.049
countries. These Sufis or these saints that
we had never believed in any caste system,

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:50.470
never believed in black and white. Christ,
He never believed in black and white. Buddha

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:58.980
never believed in black and white. Nobody
believed in any kind of man-made ideas.

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:10.360
These are all man-made ideas which we have
accepted and, even after Realization, which

00:26:12.679 --> 00:26:19.679
I have to carry all the time. Now, by saying,
we do not get rid of it, but acting we can.

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:30.740
Just see how we work out these stupid ideas
within us and how we can get rid of them.

00:26:35.159 --> 00:26:42.159
Very simple is in meditation you should sit
down and see how many people you love and

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:52.690
why do you love, not out of pity, but just
with love, how much you care for others. I've

00:26:56.389 --> 00:27:03.389
seen some very beautiful examples of that,
but still I must say that there are certain

00:27:03.519 --> 00:27:10.519
fixed ideas which are to be dislodged completely,
very important for every person who is a Guru

00:27:12.789 --> 00:27:19.789
in Sahaja Yoga. Means he has to be a clean-hearted,
open-hearted, loving-hearted fellow. His heart

00:27:20.149 --> 00:27:27.149
should play the tune of Param Chaitanya. If
his heart is full of all these man-made ideas,

00:27:31.029 --> 00:27:38.029
I don't know what will happen. Even when they
transplant the heart, they cannot do it with

00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:45.179
a man-made, they have to use a real, natural
one. So you can imagine when you try to take

00:27:45.179 --> 00:27:52.179
to all these odd ideas, are just divisive,
they will never give you collectivity.

00:27:57.769 --> 00:28:04.769
So, introspection has to be made. Are we one,
or we are judging each other? Now, the judgment

00:28:13.679 --> 00:28:20.679
is quite a lot also. Now, all this can be
seen only when you live together, otherwise

00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:31.570
how will you know? When you start living together,
you discover, start discovering what is missing

00:28:34.039 --> 00:28:41.039
in you, what is not there, what has to be
there. It is so peaceful to have a heart which

00:28:43.639 --> 00:28:50.639
is full of love because every movement of
that heart is so much joy giving, so much

00:28:55.679 --> 00:28:56.740
joy giving.

00:28:56.740 --> 00:29:03.740
There's a story of Shri Rama, that He ate
the bers, a kind of fruit, which were first

00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:16.850
tasted by an old lady with such love. Shows
what? Shows that a person like Shri Ram Who

00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:26.860
was the King of the highest heritage and this
old lady who was just of the lowest caste

00:29:29.139 --> 00:29:36.139
gives Him these fruits with such love, and
when He eats that, He starts praising it.

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:39.500
So His wife says, "Give me some!"

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:46.080
He says, "All right," but the brother is still
half way, I think, in Sahaja Yoga, so he doesn't

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:49.659
like, he doesn't like, he gets angry.

00:29:49.659 --> 00:29:51.380
Then She eats and She says, "Brother-in-law,
it's wonderful fruit, I must say!"

00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:54.019
He says, "All right, give me some."

00:29:54.019 --> 00:30:01.019
She says, "Why should I give you now? First
you were a very much angry, so why should

00:30:02.139 --> 00:30:05.070
I give you these fruits to eat?"

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:12.070
The story shows that the level of your personality
as Guru is judged by your clean heart, by

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:23.720
your loving heart, by your highest, remarkable
personality. In the personality it is not

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:35.600
something that is to be built-in artificially.
It is not artificial; it is natural, absolutely

00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:44.669
natural. Whatever you do has to be natural.
So, this artificiality of certain ways of

00:30:48.169 --> 00:30:55.169
talking or certain ways of living together
creates problem. For example, we had a ashram

00:30:57.769 --> 00:31:03.919
in America, in New York, and there was a lady
who was very strict, everything should be

00:31:03.919 --> 00:31:10.139
tip-top, it should be here, the spoons must
be there and the forks should be here, and

00:31:10.139 --> 00:31:17.139
all sort of things and she hurt many people.
Not important. These cultural, what you can

00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:26.350
call it, the taboos are not important in Sahaja
Yoga, because now, you have become a Guru.

00:31:28.049 --> 00:31:35.049
Guru can stay anywhere, live anywhere, eat
anything, any time. That should be the case.

00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:42.090
But also I've seen in Sahaja Yoga, there are
many who are very anxious to eat food as soon

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:45.090
as it is served.

00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:50.299
Once it happened, I was there, they had served
the food and just they started removing the

00:31:50.299 --> 00:31:52.419
plates.
I said, "What's the matter, I have to eat."

00:31:52.419 --> 00:31:53.490
"Oh! You haven't eaten, Mother?"

00:31:53.490 --> 00:31:56.799
"No, I haven't yet touched it even."

00:31:56.799 --> 00:32:03.799
So, you see, sort of, first it is the very
lowest type of, we should say, desire, is

00:32:06.909 --> 00:32:13.909
the hunger. Now, a Guru doesn't bother. Whatever
you give, all right, whatever he wants not

00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:21.120
to give, all right. Even if you don't give
is all right, but one has to develop that

00:32:21.879 --> 00:32:28.879
by killing your ego. People feel very hurt
if you serve them little later than another

00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:37.370
person. It's all kinds of funny things I've
seen in Sahaja Yoga. On the contrary it is

00:32:37.409 --> 00:32:44.409
the lowest type of, I should say, a desire.
You should not be very much catered to, if

00:32:44.929 --> 00:32:49.940
you want to be a real Guru.

00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:56.940
Of course, many problems are solved, as I
have seen so far that they do not take to

00:32:59.769 --> 00:33:06.769
drugs, they do not take to drinking and all
such things. You see, it's such a blessing,

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:13.450
because if I had to start from that level,
I don't know how deep I would have gone, from

00:33:13.450 --> 00:33:20.429
where I would have pulled you out. But that
is of course a very big thing. That is quite

00:33:20.429 --> 00:33:27.149
a nice thing but still, to make a beautiful
life out of it which will attract the attention

00:33:27.149 --> 00:33:34.149
of everyone - how you talk, how you behave,
how you love. So, again one has to say that

00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:43.580
Guru Pada comes only through the love that
you have. Like they'll have, say, ten people

00:33:48.019 --> 00:33:55.019
for anything, for a drama supposing, and they
have it only from a particular country or

00:33:59.009 --> 00:34:06.009
from a particular group, then there's no fun!
There's no fun. For example they'll have a

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:14.240
music group, so, from the particular one caste
could be or could be one religion, could be

00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:22.240
one, you can say, one school or anything.
So that shows that you are still not there.

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:32.730
As a Guru, you should like every kind of culture,
every kind of beauty and that has to be brought

00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:45.380
in, in our daily life. You should not look
down upon anyone for their color, for their

00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:55.950
race, for their status, class consciousness.
All this has been shown in the lives of all

00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:02.260
these Guru saints who lived.

00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:09.260
Tukarama says, "Oh God, thank God you have
made me a schedule caste." He was not but he

00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:18.940
just says so. All of us, all the time should
not be conscious of what has been our birth,

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:32.160
what has been our personality or what has
been our beginning. One should not be able

00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:41.300
to make out even who is the saint and who
is not. Even people are proud that they are

00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:46.260
saints.

00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:53.220
I was surprised in America, also, very much
that the Russians who have gone there are

00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:59.070
a very different quality people. They wouldn't
raise their eyes to Me, wouldn't raise their

00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:06.070
eyes and very deep, very, very deep. Vibrations
were very deep. The reason is, I think, they

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:13.960
have been oppressed during communism, perhaps,
maybe, and now they have come to America where

00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:22.620
they have seen so-called freedom and what
nonsense it is doing. So knowing these two

00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:32.240
extremes, I think they have gone very deep
into their own being, and they have such strength

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:42.040
and such unity among themselves. I was surprised
that I had never met them before. They didn't

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:55.080
come from Russia, they came, only they were
there. So, what is it that has kept them like

00:36:58.250 --> 00:37:05.250
that is, that they had no religion in their
heads. They had no religion. To them, every

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:13.460
religion is the same and they had no religion
to follow.

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:20.460
So, a Guru cannot belong to any religion because
these religions are also man-made. They have

00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:28.340
created such a problem all over and they are
all fighting among themselves, how can they

00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:35.340
be divine? So, you should not get involved
into some sort of a religious bias. I've seen

00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:49.380
it, that a Sahaja Yogi, say if he is a Christian,
then the bias will be shown that he is a Christian,

00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:59.240
you can make it out. If he is a Jew, you can
make it out. So what's the use of coming to

00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:07.330
Sahaja Yoga? Their attention, if it goes inside
they'll find out. You have to dissect yourself

00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:20.730
to see what's wrong with you and why is it
that you are not very successful as a Guru.

00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:32.940
The success of the Guru is: he doesn't bother
about time. Every time is the holy time. For

00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:47.550
he's not bothered if somebody is late or has
come early. He is not a slave of watches and

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:55.640
time. This is also man-made. There were no
watches about, I think, three hundred years

00:38:57.620 --> 00:39:04.620
back and nobody was so particular about the
timing. So, first thing, he is beyond time,

00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:12.510
kalatit as they call it. Then he is also gunatit.
Gunatit means he doesn't belong to the left

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:22.560
side or to the right side or to the center.
He is beyond these three, beyond these gunas

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:31.500
where he stands and sees everything in the
Divine Light. Everything! If something good

00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:39.820
happens to him, he said, "The Divine Light
has done." If something bad happens to him,

00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:46.170
he said, "The Divine light wanted this way."
Everything he leaves for the Divine Light.

00:39:46.170 --> 00:39:48.540
He is beyond the gunas.

00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:55.340
Like, supposing there is a person who is on
the right side - egoistical - then he'll start

00:39:55.340 --> 00:40:02.340
saying, "How is it? I wanted this, this didn't
work out and how...," he'll challenge. Another

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:08.610
will start crying, the left sided one that
"I'm very sorry this has happened to me, it

00:40:08.610 --> 00:40:15.610
should not have happened" and all that. In
the center also, he might think that "How

00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:22.910
far are my vibrations, how could I not know?"
and all that. But a person who is a real Guru,

00:40:26.430 --> 00:40:33.300
he looks at it as a drama, as a, just a witness
of the drama. "It happened, it was to happen,

00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:35.070
so it has happened."

00:40:35.070 --> 00:40:42.070
So, what do we get out of it? You see we get
something: the lesson that this was not right

00:40:43.810 --> 00:40:49.940
or this was wrong, that's all. For that moment,
not to go on churning in your head, that's

00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:56.940
all one gets and he is not bothered about
anything else. So he goes beyond his gunas,

00:40:57.350 --> 00:41:04.350
beyond gunas he lives, he eats anywhere, sleeps
anywhere, he is not bothered where he lives,

00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:13.230
he is not bothered whether he goes by car
or he goes by bullock cart, he doesn't feel

00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:20.470
he is being not honored if they give him a
garland of few flowers. It's not that. He

00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:33.020
is not bothered, because nothing can enhance
his personality - nothing! You give them something

00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:43.150
simple it's all right, or even if you don't
give, it's all right. It's not he judges himself

00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:51.780
through your eyes, but he judges himself through
his own eyes and he sees for himself the joy

00:41:52.310 --> 00:41:59.310
of enjoying himself. What is there to be so
particular about anything? What is so great

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:13.640
to be hankering after anything? It just works
out in its own time and if it doesn't, it

00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:19.880
doesn't. What does it matter? Just think of
it!

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:26.880
Also, in Sahaja Yoga, a Guru has to be a binding
force. There are two types of people, I've

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:40.320
seen, which go on breaking relations. It's
very easy for them. They go on complaining.

00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:51.180
But there are others who have a power to bind
people together in such a manner, in such

00:42:53.870 --> 00:43:00.870
a sweet manner that the people are brought
closer together. Not that they have to forgive,

00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:11.620
it automatically it works out. Just works
out like that and people go on joining such

00:43:12.070 --> 00:43:14.410
a man.

00:43:14.410 --> 00:43:20.710
I was surprised that in America they were
very, very few Sahaja Yogis. "We spend," they

00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:27.710
said, "Fifty thousand dollars and got fifty
Sahaja Yogis." One thousand for one Sahaja

00:43:30.430 --> 00:43:37.430
Yogi in America! So, very bad shape, but still,
you see we have to hope for them, because

00:43:41.010 --> 00:43:48.010
there are lots of seekers and lost in the
wilderness of seeking. But I thought that

00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:56.580
maybe it's a circle. They have to pass through
this circle of stupidity and then definitely

00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:04.680
they will see the point and it has happened.
We had about four thousand people for My lecture

00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:14.750
which never has happened there in that country.
"Nobody has got such a lot of audience," they

00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:22.340
said. But still, not many came but they got
their Realization.

00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:30.280
So, I think gradually, even in America it
may start growing. And the Sahaja Yogis must

00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:39.420
not only worry about their houses and where
they live and all that, but go all out to

00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:45.750
them. I would say some of the Sahaja Yogis
who could afford to go, should go to America

00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:52.750
and work out this outside work. May be if
there are outsiders who come and talk about

00:44:54.390 --> 00:45:01.390
Sahaja Yoga, they might be impressed. There
are so many false gurus that you can't count

00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:10.250
them. And they have accepted them. It's very
surprising, though they have suffered, they

00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:16.090
have lost in money, everything, still they
have accepted, "After all he is our guru!"

00:45:16.090 --> 00:45:21.290
So, there is basically something wrong with
their brains that they don't understand what

00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:25.550
is to be expected.

00:45:25.550 --> 00:45:31.610
I have written one book. Perhaps it may reach
them, but in any case you all can write your

00:45:31.610 --> 00:45:37.530
experiences and things and can publish it.
Maybe it might help them to open their eyes.

00:45:37.530 --> 00:45:44.530
While writing anything, you have to remember
that it should show your quality of Sahaja

00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:51.760
Yoga, how you are. In that, one should not
feel that you are putting them down or trying

00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:06.140
to say some things which will hurt them, but
say it in such a manner that it corrects them

00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:09.350
and helps them.

00:46:09.350 --> 00:46:16.350
For a Guru, it is important that he should
not have any false ideas about himself. He

00:46:20.810 --> 00:46:27.010
might be from a poor family, might be from
the rich family. Whatever it is, he should

00:46:27.010 --> 00:46:33.280
not be conscious of that. Because, once you
become that ... See, look at Kabira, he was

00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:40.280
just a weaver, look at Raidas, he was just
a... what you call that? Shoemaker. See, in

00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:50.940
India these are very low castes, supposed
to be. He has written beautiful poetry. Then

00:46:53.300 --> 00:47:00.300
Namadeva, he was a tailor, just think of that.
All these people have written the same thing

00:47:02.670 --> 00:47:09.670
with such great beauty of poetry. How have
they achieved? Because, now they have entered

00:47:10.930 --> 00:47:13.790
into that great realm of spirituality.

00:47:13.790 --> 00:47:20.790
You people also write some very good poetry,
I know. But some of the people who have written

00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:27.730
good poetry turned out to be very obstinate,
very egoistical people. This is something

00:47:27.730 --> 00:47:33.670
I couldn't understand. You are writing here
a beautiful poetry and here you are full of

00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:33.990
ego.

00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:40.990
So, from where this poetry is coming, God
knows. So, first of all is yourself, your

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:49.800
personality has to be something that people
should say, "This is the real Guru we have

00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:56.800
met." For that, you know very well, you don't
have to give up your family, don't have to

00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:09.780
give up anything. But ego, if it is still
there, I don't know what to say, but you must

00:48:13.050 --> 00:48:20.050
get rid of it completely and collectively
also, ego should be driven out, collectively.

00:48:20.650 --> 00:48:27.650
It's a thing that, people are egoistical secretly
within themselves but sometimes it shows,

00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:34.840
it's a very subtle nonsensical disease that
people have and they just indulge into it.

00:48:36.690 --> 00:48:43.690
On this day of Guru Puja, I have to say now
that one has to work very hard, very hard.

00:48:47.050 --> 00:48:54.050
The most important thing is how much you have
dedicated your life, your time to Sahaja Yoga.

00:48:57.160 --> 00:49:04.160
Then only you will achieve that state of Guru.
Look at Me, I'm a house wife and I have my

00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:12.150
family's responsibilities, problems, but despite
that, I'm all the time thinking about Sahaja

00:49:14.010 --> 00:49:21.010
Yogis, Sahaja Yoga and all that is this emancipation
of human beings in the whole world. Not only

00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:33.020
here or there, in the whole world. So, that
should be your widened vision, not for only

00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:43.440
your school, college, or university, your
this or that but a very wider vision one should

00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:51.240
have and that you have to develop through
your working into every type of circumstances,

00:49:53.980 --> 00:50:00.980
every type of problems you have. Once you
develop that kind of a personality, then you'll

00:50:03.150 --> 00:50:09.350
be amazed how you can help so many people.
I know there are so many Sahaja Yogis here

00:50:09.350 --> 00:50:16.350
who are worthy of praise and really I love
them very much and they also love Me very

00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:24.640
much, but one should always see that, as you
are now going to be the Gurus, you have to

00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:34.390
be careful not to think that you are a Guru.
You should never think you are a guru already.

00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:43.320
Once you start thinking again Mr. Ego, the
guru, comes up.

00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:50.320
So, once you decide that "I'm nothing, I'm
nothing, I'm just a little ripple in the heart

00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:58.270
of my Mother." If such a humble feeling you
get, then, all your problems can be solved

00:50:59.050 --> 00:51:06.050
and things will work out. Because your attention
and your behavior is going to impress other

00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:13.400
people, nothing else. Whatever you may try,
it is you who is going to get Sahaja Yoga

00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:18.910
further.

00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:25.910
There is so much to be said about how to become
a good Guru and all that but I think I'll

00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:27.960
keep it for next Guru Puja.

00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:28.850
Thank you very much.
