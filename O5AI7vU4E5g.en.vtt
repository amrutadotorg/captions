01:03.669 --> 01:06.415
Today was a very great day for all of you

01:06.868 --> 01:10.639
to jump in the river and enjoy yourselves very much.

01:11.179 --> 01:13.716
I remember the past

01:14.161 --> 01:17.260
of such days which I have also enjoyed before.

01:17.826 --> 01:19.446
But one must know that

01:19.614 --> 01:23.335
it’s not the outside that really gives you pleasure; it’s the inside.

01:23.921 --> 01:26.334
Whether there is outside or not,

01:26.446 --> 01:29.374
inside should be so elated.

01:29.574 --> 01:33.886
You can use this as a memory  for yourself,

01:34.315 --> 01:36.544
whenever you feel dejected or depressed,

01:36.688 --> 01:39.712
and should try to maintain that

01:39.876 --> 01:42.631
moment of joy and happiness within yourself.

01:42.854 --> 01:46.163
I hope you were in the present at that time,

01:46.353 --> 01:48.953
so that it is completely recorded in your memory

01:49.192 --> 01:51.256
and that you will enjoy all that.

01:51.492 --> 01:53.985
The sign of a good Sahaja yogi is that

01:54.208 --> 01:56.001
he has no complaints.

01:57.128 --> 02:00.678
He doesn’t give ideas, suggestions,

02:01.786 --> 02:03.845
and object to what Mother says

02:04.345 --> 02:06.956
and give new dimensions to it,

02:07.369 --> 02:12.185
doesn’t argue and thirdly, he’s always enjoying.

02:13.114 --> 02:16.842
If you are not enjoying still your eyes are moving on one side,

02:16.985 --> 02:20.090
brain on another side, your ears in the third direction

02:20.313 --> 02:23.743
then you are not integrated. You are not yet a proper Sahaja yogi.

02:24.116 --> 02:28.836
So you have to be a very proper, sensible Sahaja yogi.

02:29.543 --> 02:32.088
In your ascent you will discover all these things.

02:32.279 --> 02:35.858
So try to be more in the center, in the present,

02:37.173 --> 02:42.837
and then only this will become

02:43.163 --> 02:45.726
a prominent feature within your heart.

02:46.111 --> 02:49.845
And on that will be seated your Spirit shining all the time.

02:50.044 --> 02:54.928
But the seat of the Spirit is  all the time wobbly

02:55.285 --> 02:56.900
and is not there;

02:57.028 --> 02:59.940
so Spirit does not know how to emit light in your life.

03:00.365 --> 03:02.516
Now what I find is that our attention

03:02.659 --> 03:05.079
goes to all kinds of various activities,

03:05.501 --> 03:08.627
which we should see like the sea that was flowing.

03:08.858 --> 03:10.709
The re was lots of stones there.

03:10.919 --> 03:14.166
And one can learn a lesson from that,  that when the stones

03:14.650 --> 03:19.329
are there it makes a ripple, a sound, a reflection back,

03:19.750 --> 03:21.985
and the water is obstructed.

03:22.295 --> 03:25.358
In the same way, if we have stones in our head,

03:28.752 --> 03:32.117
that the flow of Kundalini get obstructed

03:32.275 --> 03:35.399
and then we get all kinds of, you see, reflections

03:35.558 --> 03:37.886
and we reflect back and then we try

03:38.027 --> 03:40.735
to give some suggestions or things, all that.

03:40.914 --> 03:43.359
We don’t allow the flow to go

03:43.476 --> 03:46.345
straight forward in a very smooth manner.

03:46.694 --> 03:50.976
So also it is very interesting and it makes a,

03:51.722 --> 03:54.767
you feel more interested because it helps the ego

03:54.998 --> 03:57.285
to grow more.

03:57.572 --> 04:02.043
But one has to learn that  that’s not the temperament of a Sahaja yogi.

04:02.503 --> 04:05.674
Sahaja yogi is a subtle personality,

04:05.865 --> 04:07.917
absolutely peaceful within himself.

04:08.195 --> 04:10.068
He has no complaints about anything.

04:10.179 --> 04:12.691
He is always enjoying. He doesn’t say anything.

04:12.835 --> 04:14.646
He doesn’t cry. He doesn’t weep.

04:14.803 --> 04:17.666
He doesn’t say, “This is wrong. That is wrong.”

04:17.857 --> 04:21.533
He doesn’t talk about his family,

04:21.684 --> 04:24.879
his children, his relations. He doesn’t.

04:25.222 --> 04:28.349
And if he has to talk about somebody,  he talks always the good,

04:28.595 --> 04:31.951
not the bad. Except for the leaders; when I ask them,

04:32.086 --> 04:33.437
they have to tell Me the truth,

04:33.569 --> 04:36.826
if I ask or if I know something or if I have to verify.

04:37.004 --> 04:40.006
But you shouldn’t get so much involved in your family, my mother,

04:40.134 --> 04:41.697
sister, wife, husband, this, that.

04:41.874 --> 04:43.694
Now it’s time for you to come up.

04:43.830 --> 04:47.385
Those who will come up and come over it will be a good idea.

04:47.909 --> 04:49.909
Secondly, as I’ve told you,

04:51.258 --> 04:54.583
that the joy of the West is finished because

04:55.036 --> 04:57.241
the men have lost power as men,

04:57.377 --> 04:59.432
and women have lost their power as woman.

04:59.677 --> 05:05.169
It’s like the eyes going into the place of the nose

05:05.282 --> 05:07.178
and the nose in the place of eyes.

05:07.323 --> 05:10.788
So that’s why this misplacement has taken place.

05:10.932 --> 05:16.409
So try to enjoy that role that you have, you have taken up

05:16.650 --> 05:20.352
and don’t to perform the role of others.

05:20.868 --> 05:23.735
This is a very simple thing which one should accept

05:24.021 --> 05:27.122
and one should work it out. And I’m sure

05:27.758 --> 05:31.450
we will all come to balances and we will be in the center.

05:33.521 --> 05:38.506
Now the problem is very simple

05:39.740 --> 05:46.561
that  we have to accept the present, the present moment.

05:47.216 --> 05:50.948
It’s very simple. At this present moment

05:51.123 --> 05:56.328
you are sitting here in front of Me for a Puja.

05:56.731 --> 06:00.507
At every present moment is to be enjoyed.

06:00.674 --> 06:03.413
Every present moment is to be enjoyed.

06:03.588 --> 06:05.950
Not to get worried about the future.

06:06.236 --> 06:08.489
Not to be upset about the past.

06:08.649 --> 06:12.619
The compassion of God is tremendous; tremendous.

06:12.991 --> 06:14.674
Allow Him to work it out.

06:15.134 --> 06:19.221
When you try to play your role then the compassion,  as I told you,

06:19.615 --> 06:21.324
acts on the stones

06:21.539 --> 06:25.120
and the stones give all this ripples and the sounds and all this

06:25.390 --> 06:32.762
jumbling. So best way to allow your mind t

06:33.143 --> 06:37.742
o be all right, is to be peaceful, alert alert, not sleepy.

06:38.465 --> 06:41.581
Only when you sleep, then you don’t have the stones there.

06:43.093 --> 06:49.048
So when you’re alert, watching and enjoying every moment.

06:50.236 --> 06:51.960
This is the message for today,

06:52.072 --> 06:55.333
because really the time is beautiful

06:55.540 --> 07:00.107
and I think it’s better that you be in thoughtless awareness and enjoy.

07:02.890 --> 07:04.760
[Mother continues in Hindi.]
