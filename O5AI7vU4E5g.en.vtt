00:01:03.669 --> 00:01:06.415
Today was a very great day for all of you

00:01:06.868 --> 00:01:10.639
to jump in the river and enjoy yourselves very much.

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:13.716
I remember the past

00:01:14.161 --> 00:01:17.260
of such days which I have also enjoyed before.

00:01:17.826 --> 00:01:19.446
But one must know that

00:01:19.614 --> 00:01:23.335
it’s not the outside that really gives you pleasure; it’s the inside.

00:01:23.921 --> 00:01:26.334
Whether there is outside or not,

00:01:26.446 --> 00:01:29.374
inside should be so elated.

00:01:29.574 --> 00:01:33.886
You can use this as a memory  for yourself,

00:01:34.315 --> 00:01:36.544
whenever you feel dejected or depressed,

00:01:36.688 --> 00:01:39.712
and should try to maintain that

00:01:39.876 --> 00:01:42.631
moment of joy and happiness within yourself.

00:01:42.854 --> 00:01:46.163
I hope you were in the present at that time,

00:01:46.353 --> 00:01:48.953
so that it is completely recorded in your memory

00:01:49.192 --> 00:01:51.256
and that you will enjoy all that.

00:01:51.492 --> 00:01:53.985
The sign of a good Sahaja yogi is that

00:01:54.208 --> 00:01:56.001
he has no complaints.

00:01:57.128 --> 00:02:00.678
He doesn’t give ideas, suggestions,

00:02:01.786 --> 00:02:03.845
and object to what Mother says

00:02:04.345 --> 00:02:06.956
and give new dimensions to it,

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:12.185
doesn’t argue and thirdly, he’s always enjoying.

00:02:13.114 --> 00:02:16.842
If you are not enjoying still your eyes are moving on one side,

00:02:16.985 --> 00:02:20.090
brain on another side, your ears in the third direction

00:02:20.313 --> 00:02:23.743
then you are not integrated. You are not yet a proper Sahaja yogi.

00:02:24.116 --> 00:02:28.836
So you have to be a very proper, sensible Sahaja yogi.

00:02:29.543 --> 00:02:32.088
In your ascent you will discover all these things.

00:02:32.279 --> 00:02:35.858
So try to be more in the center, in the present,

00:02:37.173 --> 00:02:42.837
and then only this will become

00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:45.726
a prominent feature within your heart.

00:02:46.111 --> 00:02:49.845
And on that will be seated your Spirit shining all the time.

00:02:50.044 --> 00:02:54.928
But the seat of the Spirit is  all the time wobbly

00:02:55.285 --> 00:02:56.900
and is not there;

00:02:57.028 --> 00:02:59.940
so Spirit does not know how to emit light in your life.

00:03:00.365 --> 00:03:02.516
Now what I find is that our attention

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:05.079
goes to all kinds of various activities,

00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:08.627
which we should see like the sea that was flowing.

00:03:08.858 --> 00:03:10.709
The re was lots of stones there.

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:14.166
And one can learn a lesson from that,  that when the stones

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.329
are there it makes a ripple, a sound, a reflection back,

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.985
and the water is obstructed.

00:03:22.295 --> 00:03:25.358
In the same way, if we have stones in our head,

00:03:28.752 --> 00:03:32.117
that the flow of Kundalini get obstructed

00:03:32.275 --> 00:03:35.399
and then we get all kinds of, you see, reflections

00:03:35.558 --> 00:03:37.886
and we reflect back and then we try

00:03:38.027 --> 00:03:40.735
to give some suggestions or things, all that.

00:03:40.914 --> 00:03:43.359
We don’t allow the flow to go

00:03:43.476 --> 00:03:46.345
straight forward in a very smooth manner.

00:03:46.694 --> 00:03:50.976
So also it is very interesting and it makes a,

00:03:51.722 --> 00:03:54.767
you feel more interested because it helps the ego

00:03:54.998 --> 00:03:57.285
to grow more.

00:03:57.572 --> 00:04:02.043
But one has to learn that  that’s not the temperament of a Sahaja yogi.

00:04:02.503 --> 00:04:05.674
Sahaja yogi is a subtle personality,

00:04:05.865 --> 00:04:07.917
absolutely peaceful within himself.

00:04:08.195 --> 00:04:10.068
He has no complaints about anything.

00:04:10.179 --> 00:04:12.691
He is always enjoying. He doesn’t say anything.

00:04:12.835 --> 00:04:14.646
He doesn’t cry. He doesn’t weep.

00:04:14.803 --> 00:04:17.666
He doesn’t say, “This is wrong. That is wrong.”

00:04:17.857 --> 00:04:21.533
He doesn’t talk about his family,

00:04:21.684 --> 00:04:24.879
his children, his relations. He doesn’t.

00:04:25.222 --> 00:04:28.349
And if he has to talk about somebody,  he talks always the good,

00:04:28.595 --> 00:04:31.951
not the bad. Except for the leaders; when I ask them,

00:04:32.086 --> 00:04:33.437
they have to tell Me the truth,

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:36.826
if I ask or if I know something or if I have to verify.

00:04:37.004 --> 00:04:40.006
But you shouldn’t get so much involved in your family, my mother,

00:04:40.134 --> 00:04:41.697
sister, wife, husband, this, that.

00:04:41.874 --> 00:04:43.694
Now it’s time for you to come up.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.385
Those who will come up and come over it will be a good idea.

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:49.909
Secondly, as I’ve told you,

00:04:51.258 --> 00:04:54.583
that the joy of the West is finished because

00:04:55.036 --> 00:04:57.241
the men have lost power as men,

00:04:57.377 --> 00:04:59.432
and women have lost their power as woman.

00:04:59.677 --> 00:05:05.169
It’s like the eyes going into the place of the nose

00:05:05.282 --> 00:05:07.178
and the nose in the place of eyes.

00:05:07.323 --> 00:05:10.788
So that’s why this misplacement has taken place.

00:05:10.932 --> 00:05:16.409
So try to enjoy that role that you have, you have taken up

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.352
and don’t to perform the role of others.

00:05:20.868 --> 00:05:23.735
This is a very simple thing which one should accept

00:05:24.021 --> 00:05:27.122
and one should work it out. And I’m sure

00:05:27.758 --> 00:05:31.450
we will all come to balances and we will be in the center.

00:05:33.521 --> 00:05:38.506
Now the problem is very simple

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:46.561
that  we have to accept the present, the present moment.

00:05:47.216 --> 00:05:50.948
It’s very simple. At this present moment

00:05:51.123 --> 00:05:56.328
you are sitting here in front of Me for a Puja.

00:05:56.731 --> 00:06:00.507
At every present moment is to be enjoyed.

00:06:00.674 --> 00:06:03.413
Every present moment is to be enjoyed.

00:06:03.588 --> 00:06:05.950
Not to get worried about the future.

00:06:06.236 --> 00:06:08.489
Not to be upset about the past.

00:06:08.649 --> 00:06:12.619
The compassion of God is tremendous; tremendous.

00:06:12.991 --> 00:06:14.674
Allow Him to work it out.

00:06:15.134 --> 00:06:19.221
When you try to play your role then the compassion,  as I told you,

00:06:19.615 --> 00:06:21.324
acts on the stones

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:25.120
and the stones give all this ripples and the sounds and all this

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:32.762
jumbling. So best way to allow your mind t

00:06:33.143 --> 00:06:37.742
o be all right, is to be peaceful, alert alert, not sleepy.

00:06:38.465 --> 00:06:41.581
Only when you sleep, then you don’t have the stones there.

00:06:43.093 --> 00:06:49.048
So when you’re alert, watching and enjoying every moment.

00:06:50.236 --> 00:06:51.960
This is the message for today,

00:06:52.072 --> 00:06:55.333
because really the time is beautiful

00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:00.107
and I think it’s better that you be in thoughtless awareness and enjoy.

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:04.760
[Mother continues in Hindi.]
