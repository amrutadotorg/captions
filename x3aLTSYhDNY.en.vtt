WEBVTT

00:05.880 --> 00:11.120
Today, we are all here assembled

00:11.280 --> 00:16.120
in Turkey, in Istanbul,

00:16.200 --> 00:20.960
to celebrate the resurrection of Christ

00:21.640 --> 00:27.600
and, with that also, your celebration of your resurrection.

00:28.280 --> 00:32.720
Christ’s resurrection was a great message for us.

00:35.040 --> 00:39.320
He won over the death

00:39.520 --> 00:47.720
and came out of that dead body

00:48.360 --> 00:53.120
with another body which was living body.

00:54.200 --> 00:58.840
The body was the same, but one was a dead body

00:59.000 --> 01:04.080
and another one was a body which was living.

01:07.120 --> 01:11.280
It’s not only symbolic, it actually happened within.

01:11.440 --> 01:18.760
After all, He was a divine child, He was a divine person.

01:18.920 --> 01:23.960
Actually it has happened within. It’s not just a symbolic thing

01:24.120 --> 01:31.480
that He died and He was resurrected into another person

01:31.640 --> 01:35.960
or, you can say, into a living person.

01:41.280 --> 01:47.720
For Him, what is the death? For eternal beings, there are no deaths.

01:48.280 --> 01:53.640
There’s no death for a person who’s eternal.

01:53.800 --> 01:57.880
He may, for the time being, look as if He is dead,

01:58.040 --> 02:00.640
but He can never die.

02:00.800 --> 02:05.760
Christ was like that, a very, very special incarnation,

02:05.920 --> 02:11.720
which came on this earth to be reborn out of the dead.

02:13.520 --> 02:18.040
Now we are also, when we are not yet realized souls,

02:18.200 --> 02:22.360
when we are not yet enlightened.

02:22.520 --> 02:29.200
We are also dead in the sense, our awareness is very, very…

02:30.960 --> 02:35.880
I should say, absolutely dull and dead.

02:36.040 --> 02:41.880
We can see flowers, we can see faces, we can see buildings,

02:42.040 --> 02:45.960
we can see cities, we can see all those things.

02:46.120 --> 02:50.160
All these things we see and we feel we are quite aware,

02:50.320 --> 02:52.920
which we are not.

02:53.440 --> 02:55.800
Actual awareness comes to us

02:55.960 --> 02:59.160
when we cross the limits of our mind,

02:59.320 --> 03:03.800
go beyond the mind, and this was only possible

03:03.960 --> 03:08.440
because of the resurrection of Christ.

03:08.600 --> 03:13.040
He resurrected Himself because He was a divine person.

03:13.200 --> 03:21.360
But also we are resurrected because we are blessed by Divinity.

03:21.680 --> 03:26.840
Now this mind of ours, which is in between,

03:27.000 --> 03:33.520
is controlled by Shri Jesus Christ.

03:33.680 --> 03:37.560
He controls through your Agnya, both the sides.

03:37.720 --> 03:42.360
He controls your conditionings and He controls your ego

03:42.520 --> 03:46.160
and brings a balance in you.

03:47.400 --> 03:54.040
But when this Agnya Chakra starts sprinkling,

03:54.200 --> 03:58.920
all sorts of ideas, sometimes reacting,

03:59.080 --> 04:02.200
sometimes accepting conditionings…

04:02.360 --> 04:06.320
it is a slave, it is not a free thing,

04:06.480 --> 04:12.720
because it is working under the influence of your ego

04:12.880 --> 04:15.960
or your superego.

04:17.720 --> 04:23.040
For that is the death of our awareness,

04:23.200 --> 04:29.720
that we cannot, we cannot understand something beyond.

04:29.880 --> 04:35.320
That there exists a life beyond this, we cannot accept.

04:35.480 --> 04:37.800
This is… We have seen now

04:37.960 --> 04:45.640
that we were all in a condition that one was deadened.

04:45.800 --> 04:49.280
We were feeling bad, we were feeling anxious,

04:49.440 --> 04:52.160
we were fighting and we were thinking:

04:52.320 --> 04:56.560
“There’s something wrong with our present life.”

04:56.720 --> 05:02.280
There’s something definitely which makes us slave,

05:02.440 --> 05:05.040
by which we are slavish.

05:05.200 --> 05:11.120
That we realized, no doubt, and we started seeking the Truth.

05:11.440 --> 05:15.760
We started seeking the Truth in so many ways,

05:15.920 --> 05:20.520
I know so many were… also went astray,

05:20.680 --> 05:28.240
and they lost their balance and have fallen into a complete demise.

05:28.400 --> 05:32.120
But so many of you have been salvaged,

05:32.280 --> 05:39.440
have been saved by the great example of Christ’s resurrection.

05:39.600 --> 05:42.120
He had to venture it,

05:42.280 --> 05:46.000
He had to do it and He worked it out.

05:46.160 --> 05:51.240
Without Him, our Agnya would not have been that flexible.

05:51.400 --> 05:53.800
As it is, the human beings

05:53.960 --> 05:57.800
in the olden times were conditioned very much.

05:58.000 --> 06:02.240
And when they have become modern, they are full of ego,

06:02.400 --> 06:04.080
nothing in between.

06:04.240 --> 06:07.800
With these two influences, we are imprisoned,

06:08.040 --> 06:13.080
we are absolutely dead people.

06:13.240 --> 06:16.400
We have no sensitivity for anything.

06:16.560 --> 06:20.240
I’ve seen now… even today, you can see

06:20.400 --> 06:22.760
about things are happening across,

06:22.920 --> 06:28.000
is people are very anxious to kill each other.

06:28.160 --> 06:31.600
Human beings want to kill human beings, can you imagine?

06:31.760 --> 06:38.000
Such a stupid thing that we should kill our kith and kin.

06:38.160 --> 06:41.440
Then, there are children who are killing,

06:41.600 --> 06:46.640
parents that are killing, no relationship is accepted.

06:47.040 --> 06:52.800
It’s a sign of a person whose awareness is completely dead.

06:52.960 --> 06:54.840
In our awareness, at least

06:55.000 --> 06:59.320
we should have feelings of compassion and love.

06:59.480 --> 07:04.800
But that one is lost, it’s not there, we don’t have it.

07:04.960 --> 07:08.920
The whole world is a flame, when you read about

07:09.080 --> 07:11.120
all the wars that are going on,

07:11.280 --> 07:13.200
the way they are killing children,

07:13.360 --> 07:18.600
the way they are destroying human beings.

07:20.280 --> 07:24.560
It is a wrong attitude

07:24.720 --> 07:29.040
that with destruction of human beings, things will improve.

07:29.200 --> 07:31.840
It’s a very, very wrong concept

07:32.000 --> 07:37.120
that by destroying them, one can achieve something.

07:39.280 --> 07:43.720
Our work in Sahaja Yoga is doing well, I must say,

07:43.880 --> 07:48.920
but it has to stop this horrible attitude of human beings

07:49.080 --> 07:51.080
to destroy.

07:51.240 --> 07:53.800
So you might ask then: “What to do, Mother?

07:53.960 --> 07:58.360
What to do to stop this destruction?”

07:58.520 --> 08:00.840
Answer is in the life of Christ.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.920
You resurrect people,

08:03.080 --> 08:07.360
you resurrect them, enlighten them, bring them

08:07.520 --> 08:12.360
to a state where they understand what is right and what is wrong.

08:12.520 --> 08:16.880
Let them feel, let them feel the compassion

08:17.040 --> 08:19.680
and love that is within you.

08:19.840 --> 08:23.800
When that starts, that third force within us starts acting,

08:27.680 --> 08:31.720
our ego also comes down,

08:31.880 --> 08:34.760
our conditionings also come down.

08:34.920 --> 08:37.520
For example, if you think: “We are Muslims,

08:37.680 --> 08:40.920
we have a right to kill others”, if you think:

08:41.080 --> 08:44.080
“We are Jews, we have a right to kill others.”

08:44.240 --> 08:47.200
All these differentiations and

08:47.360 --> 08:52.040
this kind of discrimination that we have is so stupid,

08:52.200 --> 08:54.640
because you are human beings,

08:54.800 --> 08:56.560
they are human beings.

08:56.720 --> 09:01.960
You are killing human beings!

09:02.920 --> 09:05.560
Not that they have committed any sin

09:05.720 --> 09:07.640
or they have done anything wrong,

09:07.800 --> 09:11.720
except that, in their foolishness, they believe that

09:11.880 --> 09:14.880
they are this and they are that.

09:15.040 --> 09:18.400
You are not! You are just human beings.

09:18.560 --> 09:23.400
In every human being, as you know very well, there is Kundalini.

09:23.560 --> 09:26.000
There’s no discrimination, everyone,

09:26.160 --> 09:31.080
whether you are a Muslim, a Jew, Hindu, Christian, Sikh, Parsee,

09:31.240 --> 09:35.160
anyone, you may call by any name.

09:35.320 --> 09:41.600
Now just look at how we accept a certain denomination for ourselves!

09:41.760 --> 09:45.360
You are born, say, to a Christian family

09:45.520 --> 09:48.640
or you are born to a Hindu family:

09:48.800 --> 09:53.240
immediately you start thinking you are there to uphold

09:53.400 --> 10:01.000
all the flags of that religion in which you are born.

10:01.240 --> 10:04.920
You are born in that religion without your knowledge,

10:05.080 --> 10:09.000
without your permission, without any understanding.

10:09.160 --> 10:12.440
So how can you belong to that religion?

10:12.600 --> 10:16.480
You have got Kundalini, everybody else has got Kundalini.

10:16.640 --> 10:21.360
So you can only belong to the religion of humanity,

10:21.520 --> 10:24.320
where every human being has got Kundalini.

10:24.480 --> 10:26.560
So, you are nothing but human beings.

10:26.720 --> 10:28.760
All these false ideas, that:

10:28.920 --> 10:31.480
“We are Hindus, we are Muslims, we are Christians”,

10:31.640 --> 10:37.880
is all man-created. I mean, man can create anything,

10:38.040 --> 10:41.600
and human beings have no brain to understand

10:41.760 --> 10:43.680
that is all man creating.

10:43.840 --> 10:47.360
For example, you see in America,

10:47.520 --> 10:52.320
they create associations and big organizations and all that,

10:52.480 --> 10:59.280
based on absolute falsehood, absolute wrong ideas,

10:59.440 --> 11:03.560
absolute destructiveness, but they form it,

11:03.720 --> 11:06.440
they form their groups, they have this, they have…

11:06.600 --> 11:10.240
and they are prospering.

11:11.960 --> 11:15.440
But it has a repercussion, they don’t know.

11:15.600 --> 11:20.240
If you start doing such false things against human beings

11:20.400 --> 11:25.200
who are created by God, and nobody can destroy them,

11:25.360 --> 11:27.800
then there are repercussions.

11:27.960 --> 11:31.640
Many, many countries, who were, once upon a time, rulers,

11:31.800 --> 11:35.920
were known as great things, have come down.

11:36.080 --> 11:38.760
And all such countries who now think they are very rich

11:38.920 --> 11:41.760
and all that, will have to come down.

11:41.920 --> 11:46.120
All of them have to come down, is just an ultimate result

11:46.280 --> 11:50.400
of this stupidity to believe that you are higher than others,

11:50.560 --> 11:54.760
that you can kill others.

11:55.720 --> 11:59.720
So, a non-violent method started

11:59.880 --> 12:02.280
which is of another absurdity, I think,

12:02.480 --> 12:10.040
because then they start saving mosquitoes and also the bugs,

12:10.200 --> 12:13.000
while mosquitoes and bugs are,

12:13.160 --> 12:18.520
you must know, are the greatest blood-suckers.

12:18.680 --> 12:21.880
They live only on human blood.

12:22.600 --> 12:26.120
Such things, what’s the use of saving them?

12:26.280 --> 12:33.680
So, human beings take to something that is absurd, stupid, foolish.

12:33.840 --> 12:36.360
I don’t know what is the reason.

12:36.520 --> 12:41.080
The way they accept things is absolutely unbelievable.

12:41.240 --> 12:44.920
I think it is a kind of a slavish mentality

12:45.080 --> 12:46.680
which does not give them freedom

12:46.840 --> 12:49.040
to think what is right, what is wrong.

12:49.200 --> 12:54.040
For this, we have Christ. We have Christ, a person

12:54.200 --> 12:57.200
who was absolutely free,

12:57.360 --> 13:01.560
free from all kinds of prejudices,

13:02.480 --> 13:06.160
all kinds of temptations,

13:06.320 --> 13:10.960
all kinds of nonsense that human beings follow.

13:11.120 --> 13:14.960
But one may say that: “Mother, after all, He was divine!”

13:15.120 --> 13:19.000
He was divine and now you are made divine also.

13:19.160 --> 13:27.600
So, how can we now join together to make a full effort,

13:28.400 --> 13:32.480
a full effort, to tell people that:

13:32.640 --> 13:38.240
“What are you doing? Why are you doing it?

13:38.400 --> 13:41.040
What is the need to do such things?”

13:41.200 --> 13:45.640
On one side is, we can say, a mass destruction

13:45.800 --> 13:52.280
through stupidity, another side is your own self-destruction.

13:53.840 --> 14:00.480
Take to drinking, take to other self-destructive things

14:00.640 --> 14:03.400
which are immoral,

14:03.560 --> 14:07.640
that’s very easily available, and people like it very much.

14:07.800 --> 14:13.040
They don’t like when you talk that: “This is destructive.”

14:13.200 --> 14:17.880
So, either we destroy others or destroy ourselves.

14:18.040 --> 14:24.320
Christ was destroyed by others and He resurrected by Himself.

14:24.480 --> 14:27.160
So we are also in the same position now.

14:27.320 --> 14:30.400
I know many a times Sahaja Yoga was challenged.

14:30.560 --> 14:33.040
Now it’s much better, not so bad…

14:33.200 --> 14:36.320
was challenged and there were so many problems.

14:36.480 --> 14:40.360
But now it’s smoothing down,

14:40.520 --> 14:43.840
because that’s the Truth, that’s the Reality,

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
that’s what is Divinity.

14:46.160 --> 14:48.640
So, you should not be afraid.

14:48.800 --> 14:55.320
All these funny ideas about Sahaja Yoga also will die out.

14:55.480 --> 15:00.000
It’s a resurrection, not only of you people,

15:00.160 --> 15:04.720
but also of your ideologies.

15:04.880 --> 15:07.000
Now the ideologies change,

15:07.160 --> 15:11.280
that our awareness should be enlightened.

15:11.440 --> 15:14.080
We should have light in our awareness.

15:14.240 --> 15:17.400
This has come suddenly through Sahaja Yoga to people, that:

15:17.560 --> 15:19.520
“If you don’t have the light,

15:19.680 --> 15:25.040
how can you go further in the right path?”

15:25.200 --> 15:30.000
It’s not easy to describe Christ’s life, how He went through that.

15:30.480 --> 15:35.680
He died so young and brutally He was killed.

15:35.920 --> 15:40.600
But still all that, He resurrected Himself.

15:40.760 --> 15:44.840
He came out of all that, came out of that ordeal.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.640
So for us also, when we are in Sahaja Yoga problems,

15:48.800 --> 15:51.760
we should know we have a power to resurrect ourselves.

15:51.920 --> 15:55.960
No one can destroy us! No one can finish us off,

15:56.120 --> 16:00.240
because we have a power to resurrect ourselves.

16:00.520 --> 16:03.520
This special power that we have to resurrect,

16:03.680 --> 16:09.160
you should all the time understand and feel it and meditate on that.

16:09.320 --> 16:12.560
I hear from people from every country:

16:12.720 --> 16:14.160
“The government is doing like this,

16:14.320 --> 16:15.840
the government is doing like this!”

16:16.000 --> 16:17.520
or they are having some trouble,

16:17.680 --> 16:21.240
they call you a sect, they call you this and that…

16:21.400 --> 16:23.640
Alright, doesn’t matter!

16:23.800 --> 16:25.840
Your duty is to believe

16:26.000 --> 16:30.160
that you are following the footsteps of Christ.

16:30.320 --> 16:33.000
And no one can destroy it!

16:33.160 --> 16:35.720
This is the message of Christ’s life,

16:35.880 --> 16:39.880
that divine life cannot be destroyed.

16:40.760 --> 16:43.120
When this body could not be destroyed,

16:43.280 --> 16:47.440
then how can you destroy the divine light in Him?

16:47.600 --> 16:49.600
So many Sahaja Yogis are here,

16:49.760 --> 16:52.880
who have been since long in Sahaja Yoga,

16:53.040 --> 16:54.840
and they have had problems,

16:55.000 --> 16:57.960
and they went through lot of troubles, I agree!

16:58.120 --> 17:01.000
But all these things have subsided.

17:01.160 --> 17:04.280
And now you are in such a resurrected position

17:04.440 --> 17:07.160
that, after some time, -you’ll be amazed-

17:07.320 --> 17:12.360
Sahaja Yoga will take over, all over the world.

17:12.520 --> 17:15.600
All over the world, people will take to Sahaja Yoga

17:15.760 --> 17:19.720
and we’ll have such a lot of Sahaja Yogis all over the world

17:19.880 --> 17:25.840
that all this minority of some stupid people will disappear.

17:26.760 --> 17:29.880
For that, what have you to do? Sometimes, people ask Me:

17:30.040 --> 17:34.160
“What do we have to do?” You must have also read the Bible,

17:34.320 --> 17:38.960
that Christ prayed and He was praying.

17:39.120 --> 17:42.920
In the same way, we can say, we have to meditate.

17:43.080 --> 17:46.040
Through meditation, we’ll grow in our awareness,

17:46.200 --> 17:52.880
in our new personality, in our strengthened personality.

17:53.040 --> 17:56.120
Meditation is the only way we can grow,

17:56.280 --> 17:59.440
and then no one can destroy you,

17:59.600 --> 18:03.080
because you are all protected by the Divine Love.

18:03.240 --> 18:04.400
You don’t have to worry

18:04.560 --> 18:07.280
as to who will destroy you, what will happen.

18:07.440 --> 18:10.440
Of course, in the beginning there’s little agitation,

18:10.600 --> 18:13.320
people feel a little bad about it, it’s alright!

18:13.480 --> 18:17.560
But actually, NO ONE can destroy you.

18:17.720 --> 18:19.640
Have this faith in you!

18:19.800 --> 18:22.160
Christ had no organization;

18:22.320 --> 18:26.880
He had no Adi Shakti to support Him, in no way.

18:27.040 --> 18:31.320
But only through His divine personality,

18:31.480 --> 18:34.400
He managed to get out of all the problems,

18:34.560 --> 18:40.200
of all the tortures, of all the atrocities on Him.

18:40.520 --> 18:43.040
So now, you have better advantage,

18:43.200 --> 18:44.960
because you are enlightened.

18:45.120 --> 18:49.920
Firstly, He was a divine person and He could go through that.

18:50.080 --> 18:51.760
You don’t have to!

18:51.920 --> 18:54.000
Nobody will torture you, nobody will put you in jail,

18:54.160 --> 18:55.960
nobody will crucify you.

18:56.120 --> 18:58.600
Nobody will, that’s not possible.

18:58.760 --> 19:03.680
But mentally, if you are upset, sometimes you get upset I know,

19:03.840 --> 19:06.280
in certain countries people get upset,

19:06.440 --> 19:09.600
because they think they are oppressed because they are in Sahaja Yoga.

19:09.760 --> 19:14.440
I assure you, no one can do that.

19:14.920 --> 19:19.960
You must know that you are all the time protected.

19:21.400 --> 19:25.640
Christ is there as your elder brother, I always said that.

19:25.800 --> 19:28.160
But also you have your Mother,

19:28.320 --> 19:32.360
and you have all the Ganas and all the Angels around you.

19:32.520 --> 19:35.800
When I see this, I just thought: “Look at this,

19:35.960 --> 19:42.240
in every country they have shown Angels and Ganas are there!”

19:42.400 --> 19:46.080
Such pure forms of protection you have.

19:46.240 --> 19:49.280
So there’s nothing to worry about

19:49.440 --> 19:53.640
your destruction or your impediments,

19:53.800 --> 19:55.480
or whatever you may call it,

19:55.640 --> 20:01.480
a kind of destructive forces acting on you.

20:01.640 --> 20:07.480
From the life of Christ, you have to know that no one can destroy

20:07.640 --> 20:11.160
a realised soul in these modern times.

20:11.320 --> 20:13.240
As it is, they never destroyed.

20:13.400 --> 20:17.680
We had so many Saints who were killed, who were tortured,

20:17.840 --> 20:22.120
but see, they still exist as poetry, as poems,

20:22.280 --> 20:30.560
also as blessings, everywhere they are not finished.

20:30.720 --> 20:34.200
They are not dead, though it seems that they are no more,

20:34.360 --> 20:41.880
but even to take their names and even to call them, they work out.

20:42.040 --> 20:46.000
They are there in their Spirit and they help.

20:46.160 --> 20:49.440
Assured by Christ’s life,

20:49.600 --> 20:54.680
by His resurrection, we are resurrected people.

20:54.920 --> 20:58.400
Of course, our body also has changed.

20:58.560 --> 21:02.760
After resurrection, you know that your Chakras work out

21:02.920 --> 21:06.600
all the curing and all the blessings.

21:06.760 --> 21:10.320
Our attitude, our mental attitude also changes,

21:10.480 --> 21:13.440
and also your ego subsides.

21:13.600 --> 21:16.800
Not only that, also our conditionings go out.

21:16.960 --> 21:21.200
Specially I was so happy that those people, say,

21:21.360 --> 21:23.560
who are born in a particular religion,

21:23.720 --> 21:27.080
immediately they see what’s wrong with that religion,

21:27.240 --> 21:32.440
as if they turn round and see the image of their society

21:32.600 --> 21:34.360
and know what’s wrong with them.

21:34.520 --> 21:40.240
And when they start meditating on those corrections,

21:40.400 --> 21:44.120
it works, societies are improving.

21:44.280 --> 21:49.120
You see, so-called religious ideas are falling into their own traps,

21:49.280 --> 21:52.400
and they will all fall because they’re falsehood.

21:52.560 --> 21:54.120
That’s not real religion.

21:54.280 --> 21:58.640
The religion is within ourselves and this pure religion

21:58.800 --> 22:02.280
is the one which is a global religion.

22:02.440 --> 22:07.920
The solution comes like that: supposing you have wars…

22:12.600 --> 22:14.960
wars in the name of religion,

22:15.120 --> 22:17.600
in the name of God specially.

22:17.760 --> 22:21.920
And in the name of religions they have wars.

22:22.080 --> 22:24.400
So now, what happens?

22:24.560 --> 22:31.840
All these wars that take place cannot destroy Reality,

22:31.960 --> 22:34.040
cannot destroy the Truth.

22:34.200 --> 22:37.520
This is another message of Christ’s resurrection.

22:37.680 --> 22:39.040
You cannot!

22:39.200 --> 22:42.440
You may think that today you have destroyed these people,

22:42.600 --> 22:45.400
but they are there.

22:45.560 --> 22:50.400
All the Saints, all the great people

22:50.560 --> 22:57.280
who have been resurrected in life are all the time there.

22:57.440 --> 23:00.840
Their protections are there, their guidance is there,

23:01.000 --> 23:07.000
you can see them in a way that they are there.

23:07.400 --> 23:14.960
So one should have no fear. The fear of death has to go.

23:15.200 --> 23:17.360
So many of them have said the same

23:17.520 --> 23:19.360
that: “What is death after all?”

23:19.520 --> 23:24.160
Death dies itself, once you are resurrected.

23:24.320 --> 23:27.080
So one should not be afraid of death.

23:27.240 --> 23:30.800
Now how many of you have been afraid of death

23:30.960 --> 23:34.400
before your resurrection, but not now?

23:34.560 --> 23:38.120
You are not bothered as to when the death comes, what happens

23:38.280 --> 23:42.840
or which way you are going to be so-called destroyed.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.080
You know you cannot be destroyed.

23:45.240 --> 23:48.360
In your heart of hearts, you all know this very well,

23:48.520 --> 23:52.040
that you cannot be destroyed.

23:52.800 --> 24:00.960
The fear of our destruction goes away, no doubt.

24:01.080 --> 24:05.160
But there is one thing, is the compassion.

24:05.320 --> 24:07.480
When you see all these bad things are happening

24:07.640 --> 24:13.320
and people are being tortured, your mind is… you see…

24:13.480 --> 24:15.720
cannot take it for granted.

24:15.880 --> 24:20.480
It starts responding to that,

24:20.640 --> 24:26.120
and it feels the pain of others, tremendous!

24:26.280 --> 24:30.920
But as a result of that, your will power,

24:31.080 --> 24:35.800
your thinking on those lines, your tears even are powerful

24:35.960 --> 24:39.040
and they can bring solace to those people

24:39.200 --> 24:41.480
who are suffering unnecessarily.

24:41.640 --> 24:46.360
You have to experiment with it.

24:46.520 --> 24:57.240
Just having a feeling of compassion and love, things will improve.

24:57.480 --> 25:01.560
Now, as it is, we meditate.

25:01.720 --> 25:07.040
But we can meditate also with such compassion

25:07.200 --> 25:13.640
and such love that your tears can also have an effect

25:13.800 --> 25:16.200
on these people who are so cruel

25:16.360 --> 25:20.200
and stupid and killing each other.

25:20.480 --> 25:25.320
But it is important for you to know that now

25:25.480 --> 25:28.880
you are not an individual, but you have become a global personality,

25:29.040 --> 25:31.280
a global personality.

25:31.440 --> 25:35.680
You are not an individual, you are a global personality,

25:35.840 --> 25:42.040
and sitting down here, you are working out all the global problems.

25:42.600 --> 25:44.960
You are not a small person now,

25:45.160 --> 25:47.160
who’s only worried about your own children,

25:47.320 --> 25:50.680
about your family, about this and that, no!

25:50.840 --> 25:55.520
This mind of yours has expanded, expanded like this,

25:55.680 --> 26:02.160
that it works automatically for all the problems of the world.

26:02.320 --> 26:05.000
When for a woman I read newspapers,

26:05.160 --> 26:07.880
specially women seldom read newspapers,

26:08.040 --> 26:10.520
they think it's stupidity to read those papers.

26:10.680 --> 26:16.440
But I read, I read and I read those where My attention is in it.

26:16.600 --> 26:21.120
I’ve seen it works! But all of you put together, if you understand

26:21.280 --> 26:24.520
that this is your responsibility to correct

26:24.680 --> 26:30.800
all the destructive forces, to put them right,

26:30.960 --> 26:35.160
we just have to collectively meditate on the points

26:35.320 --> 26:39.120
where you find there’s a big problem.

26:39.560 --> 26:43.920
Now the problem mainly is because of religions, mainly.

26:44.080 --> 26:47.480
Now, if they can all jump into the new religion,

26:47.640 --> 26:51.920
global religion, they all are one.

26:52.080 --> 26:55.480
They cannot then fight because there’s one religion.

26:55.640 --> 26:57.680
But they don’t want to have one religion,

26:57.840 --> 27:00.520
because they want to fight. They’re fighting cocks.

27:00.680 --> 27:05.800
But if they come to Sahaj, if they become enlightened,

27:05.960 --> 27:09.640
then they will only enjoy love of each other

27:09.800 --> 27:14.600
and not killing of each other, destruction of others.

27:14.760 --> 27:18.960
And this is what we have to learn from life of Christ,

27:19.160 --> 27:20.880
who was alone, who was single.

27:21.040 --> 27:23.400
He did not have such a collective behind Him.

27:23.560 --> 27:27.840
But how powerful He was that He fought the death

27:28.000 --> 27:32.720
and came out of it so clearly at the stage of Agnya!

27:32.880 --> 27:36.240
Without Him, we could not have worked out Sahaja Yoga.

27:36.400 --> 27:38.680
Kundalini would not have gone through,

27:38.840 --> 27:41.400
unless and until He had sacrificed His life.

27:41.560 --> 27:43.400
And He readily sacrificed,

27:43.560 --> 27:48.440
He accepted the task of sacrificing His life,

27:48.600 --> 27:50.520
and then resurrected.

27:50.680 --> 27:53.640
He passed through that, I should say,

27:53.800 --> 27:57.200
a very constricted channel of Agnya,

27:57.360 --> 28:04.640
to put you people right, by saying: “You forgive everyone.”

28:04.800 --> 28:07.480
If forgiving was such a powerful thing

28:07.640 --> 28:11.600
that you can even fight your death, then why not forgive?

28:11.760 --> 28:14.160
Many people say: “Mother, we can’t forgive!”

28:14.320 --> 28:15.840
and I’ve told hundred times that:

28:15.960 --> 28:19.360
“What are you doing if not forgiving?”

28:19.520 --> 28:23.200
So, the message of Christ’s life is that He forgot,

28:23.360 --> 28:26.280
forgave all the people who troubled Him.

28:26.440 --> 28:29.720
Even He said that: “O God, please forgive them,

28:29.880 --> 28:33.400
because they don’t know what they are doing!”

28:33.560 --> 28:38.520
On the cross, He said those things, when He was tortured, insulted,

28:38.680 --> 28:41.240
He’s saying what? “You forgive them,

28:41.400 --> 28:44.520
have pity, have sympathy for them,

28:44.680 --> 28:47.880
because they don’t know what they are doing!” They are killing

28:48.040 --> 28:50.840
the Son of God, and what will happen to them?

28:51.000 --> 28:55.480
Where will they go? What will be their situation?

28:55.640 --> 29:03.480
This one is a big message for us,

29:03.640 --> 29:07.520
that even on the cross, He said: “Forgive,

29:07.680 --> 29:11.440
O God, O Father, forgive them!”

29:11.600 --> 29:15.520
In the same way, we have to also forgive people.

29:15.680 --> 29:21.400
It’s very important from the life of Christ that we have to forgive.

29:21.560 --> 29:27.200
His forgiveness was of the greatest importance.

29:27.360 --> 29:30.360
For the whole world to understand, you must forgive.

29:30.520 --> 29:33.360
If you learn how to forgive, you’ll be amazed,

29:33.520 --> 29:36.840
half of the wars of this world will be finished!

29:36.960 --> 29:40.120
Now, something happened thousands of years back.

29:40.280 --> 29:44.400
Still people are fighting, still they are fighting,

29:44.560 --> 29:47.160
thinking these things happened so many years back,

29:47.320 --> 29:49.960
so they are our ennemies.

29:51.520 --> 29:54.640
If He can really forgive those people,

29:54.800 --> 29:59.920
what happened before we were even born,

30:00.080 --> 30:05.440
why should we form a group of such people, why?

30:05.600 --> 30:10.760
Because there is something called hatred in human beings,

30:11.360 --> 30:15.560
they have hatred, hatred for this, hatred for that,

30:15.760 --> 30:19.880
even in small things they’ll say: “I don’t like it, I like it!”

30:20.040 --> 30:22.440
It’s very common,

30:26.640 --> 30:29.120
nowadays specially.

30:29.280 --> 30:32.080
When we were young, we were not supposed to say such a thing:

30:32.240 --> 30:35.560
“I don’t like it, I like it!”,

30:35.720 --> 30:37.480
we were not supposed to say.

30:37.640 --> 30:41.400
But now their freedom has given them to talk like this:

30:41.560 --> 30:43.920
“I don’t like it, I don’t like that,

30:44.080 --> 30:49.440
I don’t like that, I don’t like that person!” Who are you?

30:49.600 --> 30:53.720
What do you think of yourself to judge others?

30:53.880 --> 30:55.840
You don’t know how to appreciate,

30:56.000 --> 30:57.840
you don’t know how to enjoy

30:57.960 --> 31:00.600
and only what you go on is: “I don’t like it!”

31:00.760 --> 31:03.520
And supposing you like it, what will you do?

31:03.680 --> 31:08.040
Whether you like it or don’t like is just the same!

31:08.200 --> 31:11.080
But just to show off their ego, we say:

31:11.240 --> 31:16.480
“I don’t like this way, I don’t like!”

31:17.200 --> 31:20.440
Because there’s no love!

31:20.600 --> 31:26.680
If there is love, then you can enjoy everything.

31:26.840 --> 31:30.560
We’ll never say: “I don’t like it, I like it!”

31:30.720 --> 31:37.440
You will definitely enjoy if you really say

31:37.600 --> 31:41.440
that: “I enjoy, I enjoy everything!”

31:41.600 --> 31:44.280
You are closing down yourself by saying:

31:44.440 --> 31:48.640
“I don’t like it, I don’t like it, I don’t like!”

31:48.800 --> 31:50.840
as if you are a great connoisseur,

31:50.960 --> 31:55.800
or a person, a judge, to say this!

31:55.960 --> 32:01.160
It is very remarkable that in the West it’s even more prominent

32:01.320 --> 32:04.840
that they will say: “I don’t like it, I don’t like!”

32:05.000 --> 32:07.960
Of course, in the East, I would say in India,

32:08.160 --> 32:10.120
if somebody says like that, people will say

32:10.280 --> 32:13.440
he’s just trying to show off. On the face!

32:13.600 --> 32:20.800
But showing off is not regarded as bad manners.

32:20.960 --> 32:23.800
It’s not regarded as bad manners in the West.

32:23.960 --> 32:28.440
To feel shy of anything is regarded as bad manners,

32:28.600 --> 32:35.800
but to boast of something, nobody feels that it is a bad thing.

32:36.040 --> 32:39.760
Did Christ boast of anything? Never!

32:39.920 --> 32:43.080
He never boasted of anything,

32:43.240 --> 32:51.160
but when He saw people were selling things in the holy places,

32:51.320 --> 32:52.920
what did He do?

32:53.080 --> 32:56.280
He started beating them with a hunter,

32:56.440 --> 32:59.280
because that was wrong, absolutely wrong,

32:59.440 --> 33:03.560
against the holiness of the place.

33:03.720 --> 33:06.200
But He did not say: “I don’t like it!” No!

33:06.360 --> 33:12.360
He just showed His complete disapproval

33:12.520 --> 33:15.720
of the whole system of selling things

33:15.880 --> 33:20.760
in the temple or in a holy place.

33:20.920 --> 33:23.600
People go there to worship.

33:23.760 --> 33:30.400
They need a mind which is devoid of money orientation.

33:31.560 --> 33:39.800
There should be no money orientation when you are meditating.

33:39.960 --> 33:43.360
This is the biggest problem of today.

33:43.640 --> 33:46.920
Everything is money orientation.

33:47.240 --> 33:53.120
You like a car which is very expensive, so you want to have.

33:53.280 --> 33:56.600
By hook and crook, you will get that car and sit in there.

33:56.760 --> 34:04.000
You might be a thief, but you buy an expensive car to show off,

34:04.320 --> 34:08.360
perhaps maybe because you are a thief, that’s why you want to hide

34:08.520 --> 34:10.640
your personality.

34:10.800 --> 34:15.640
So there is no truthful life, it’s all just showing off

34:15.800 --> 34:17.960
and thinking no end of yourself.

34:18.160 --> 34:24.120
But when the death will come at your doorstep, what will you do?

34:24.280 --> 34:29.600
At that time, you will be trembling

34:29.760 --> 34:33.080
with all your so-called achievements

34:33.240 --> 34:35.000
and your so-called showing off.

34:35.160 --> 34:38.960
You will just tremble before death.

34:39.160 --> 34:42.480
But a Sahaja Yogi cannot!

34:42.640 --> 34:47.560
He will like, if the death has to come, it has to come!

34:47.720 --> 34:53.320
He will not tremble that the death is something dangerous,

34:53.480 --> 34:56.640
but is a place where he can go and rest.

34:56.800 --> 35:00.080
He won’t mind, he won’t mind anything,

35:00.240 --> 35:05.480
because he is above that, he is above destruction.

35:05.640 --> 35:08.880
So, he won’t mind anything, whatever comes his way

35:09.040 --> 35:13.600
and he will surrender to it easily.

35:13.760 --> 35:17.440
We have Kabir. Kabir has written so many poems,

35:17.600 --> 35:22.560
mostly about death.

35:22.960 --> 35:27.560
He said: “When death came, I didn’t say a single word,

35:27.720 --> 35:31.000
I didn’t fight, but what I did,

35:31.160 --> 35:37.520
I took a sheet on top of me and went off to sleep!”

35:37.680 --> 35:40.560
How sweetly he described death sometimes,

35:40.720 --> 35:44.600
and Kabir then reminds Me of Christ.

35:44.760 --> 35:49.960
How sweetly Christ also went through all these things,

35:50.160 --> 35:58.280
and when He died, the whole elements shook.

35:58.600 --> 36:01.200
He was the master of elements.

36:01.360 --> 36:02.600
They shook,

36:02.760 --> 36:07.080
there was earthquake and all kinds of things that happened.

36:07.240 --> 36:11.800
They, they felt His death, not Him!

36:11.960 --> 36:16.120
They felt that such a great divinity

36:16.280 --> 36:24.840
which is the essence of existence has been killed like this.

36:25.000 --> 36:28.880
They also didn’t know that He is going to come back to His life.

36:29.040 --> 36:32.000
They also were not aware of it, but He did.

36:32.160 --> 36:37.160
He did come out of that deadening thing, for which

36:37.320 --> 36:41.680
everybody was so much shocked.

36:43.320 --> 36:48.000
His death itself gives us strength,

36:48.200 --> 36:51.960
that we have no death, we have resurrected

36:52.120 --> 36:56.360
and resurrection is with us.

36:56.520 --> 36:58.360
But we have to establish,

36:58.520 --> 37:03.480
we have to establish our Sahaja Yoga, our meditation.

37:03.640 --> 37:05.320
That’s very important.

37:05.480 --> 37:08.120
The other day, I met a lady.

37:08.280 --> 37:13.400
She told of a miracle in her life, how she was saved.

37:13.560 --> 37:19.040
She was about to die, she came across an accident, all kind…

37:19.200 --> 37:23.480
But how she was saved, while her husband,

37:23.640 --> 37:26.880
he succumbs to all kinds of things. So I said:

37:27.040 --> 37:29.480
“What do you mean, how it happened?” She said:

37:29.640 --> 37:33.160
“Mother, it’s nothing but Shraddha!”

37:33.320 --> 37:38.280
Shraddha is dedication, surrendering.

37:38.440 --> 37:43.600
“Surrendering, because I’m surrendered!”

37:43.760 --> 37:48.040
But I said: “How?” “That, I don’t know, I’m just surrendered.

37:48.200 --> 37:54.400
I feel so comfortable, so lively and so much out of fear

37:54.560 --> 37:56.760
when I know I’m surrendered,

37:56.920 --> 37:59.880
completely surrendered to my Spirit!”

38:00.040 --> 38:02.440
And this what it is what we have to learn

38:02.600 --> 38:05.880
when we meditate, that we have to surrender.

38:06.040 --> 38:09.560
Muhammad has called “Islam”. Islam means surrender,

38:09.720 --> 38:12.720
though they don’t surrender -otherwise you see…-

38:12.880 --> 38:16.600
but what is that you must surrender

38:16.760 --> 38:21.800
to your global nature, to your higher nature.

38:21.960 --> 38:25.360
You must not die out,

38:25.520 --> 38:27.600
you must not fizzle out

38:27.760 --> 38:32.880
into these worldly turmoil and worldly things.

38:33.040 --> 38:38.720
It’s a very strength-giving example of Christ.

38:38.880 --> 38:43.840
And He’s with us, He will always guide us, He’ll look after us,

38:43.960 --> 38:46.880
not only but He’ll give us strength.

38:47.040 --> 38:53.000
He will destroy all those who will be against eternal life.

38:53.160 --> 38:55.200
He’ll destroy nonsensical things.

38:55.360 --> 39:00.280
And you are seeing now how in Kali Yuga all these institutions

39:00.440 --> 39:05.120
who talk of religion and fights are getting destroyed.

39:05.280 --> 39:07.960
Automatically, we have done nothing.

39:08.080 --> 39:12.440
On their own only, while they’re doing, they are finishing,

39:12.600 --> 39:16.880
because there’s no Reality, there’s no Spirit in it,

39:17.040 --> 39:22.920
and without the Spirit, what is left is nothing but a dead body.

39:23.080 --> 39:28.120
The whole understanding should be for Sahaja Yogis,

39:28.280 --> 39:32.520
that we have to be Spirit-oriented,

39:32.680 --> 39:38.440
not money-oriented, body-oriented, emotion-oriented,

39:38.600 --> 39:40.640
but Spirit-oriented,

39:40.800 --> 39:43.080
which is a joy-giving thing.

39:43.240 --> 39:46.840
And you’ll be surprised with that orientation,

39:46.960 --> 39:55.280
you will be the most happy, most loving,

39:55.440 --> 39:59.760
most beautiful person.

39:59.920 --> 40:02.160
Immediately, people will know around

40:02.320 --> 40:05.320
that there’s something about this man, some spark

40:05.480 --> 40:11.800
about this lady, some sort of a spark that she is or he is

40:11.960 --> 40:18.080
so much different from us. It can be recognized in no time.

40:18.320 --> 40:24.360
Now, at the time of Christ, very few people could recognize,

40:24.520 --> 40:27.720
because they were not enlightened,

40:27.880 --> 40:35.000
because they were very much below the level of human beings,

40:35.160 --> 40:37.880
I should say. But you are not!

40:38.040 --> 40:42.040
You are quite aware, you are born in modern times,

40:42.200 --> 40:44.960
and at this time, when we think of Christ,

40:45.080 --> 40:47.480
we should know what a life it was,

40:47.640 --> 40:50.960
what a grand personality it was,

40:51.160 --> 40:54.720
that He subjected to this kind of a torture.

40:54.880 --> 40:57.480
He could have destroyed all of them in no time.

40:57.640 --> 41:01.480
He was so powerful, such a powerful personality,

41:01.640 --> 41:05.880
but He did not! He forgave them.

41:06.040 --> 41:08.720
He gave you the message of forgiveness,

41:08.880 --> 41:11.640
the greatest force that can work out.

41:11.800 --> 41:14.160
Now also, you should surrender yourself

41:14.320 --> 41:19.480
to this idea of forgiveness and really try to forgive.

41:19.640 --> 41:23.320
You’ll be amazed, you will feel very much peaceful, very happy,

41:23.480 --> 41:28.400
and the person who has tortured you will come round.

41:29.080 --> 41:33.640
What we have to do is now to transform people. That’s our job.

41:33.800 --> 41:36.400
We have to transform them. We are transformed.

41:36.560 --> 41:39.440
We are at a point, we can call it, we are resurrected.

41:39.600 --> 41:42.880
We have to resurrect the whole world, that’s our job,

41:43.080 --> 41:46.400
so that all these fights, all these quarrels,

41:46.560 --> 41:50.920
all these falsehoods will just be finished.

41:51.080 --> 41:54.800
For us, Christ is our leader, who has done this for us.

41:54.960 --> 41:56.720
He came as an ordinary human being,

41:56.880 --> 41:58.800
lived like an ordinary human being,

41:58.960 --> 42:01.360
with all these powers within Him.

42:01.520 --> 42:03.800
He never used them to destroy.

42:03.960 --> 42:08.720
In the same way, we can also with love and affection,

42:08.880 --> 42:13.680
we can also really come out of our deaths,

42:13.840 --> 42:16.080
come out of our misgivings,

42:16.240 --> 42:19.560
come out of our destructive nature.

42:19.720 --> 42:26.080
This destructive nature is the most dangerous thing for Yogis.

42:26.240 --> 42:32.800
That’s the only hope we have, that Sahaja Yogis are resurrected.

42:32.960 --> 42:37.280
Only thing I know is that,

42:37.440 --> 42:42.240
if we have so many Sahaja Yogis, this world will change.

42:42.400 --> 42:44.080
This world has to change.

42:44.240 --> 42:46.560
But your progress should go on,

42:46.720 --> 42:51.360
you should progress more and more, not you should not regress back.

42:51.520 --> 42:54.240
For small things here and there, don’t worry!

42:54.400 --> 42:57.160
You have a very great responsibility,

42:57.320 --> 43:02.640
and that responsibility is to transform the human beings.

43:02.800 --> 43:07.720
That’s your due. How many have you transformed?

43:07.880 --> 43:13.080
How many have you changed? It’s all right for men or women.

43:13.240 --> 43:16.400
You have to change people, this is your job

43:16.560 --> 43:20.080
and this is the power you have got from Christ,

43:20.240 --> 43:23.400
that you have to change them, transform them

43:23.560 --> 43:26.960
into the new world of happiness and joy

43:27.160 --> 43:33.400
which we call it as the Sahaj Nirmal Dharma.

43:33.560 --> 43:37.240
If it works out, if it really works out,

43:37.400 --> 43:42.120
think of the world, how beautiful it will become for us!

43:42.280 --> 43:44.880
It’s the duty of every Sahaja Yogi

43:45.080 --> 43:50.160
to go into this kind of a new venture

43:50.320 --> 43:55.400
and try to find out how many people he can convert

43:55.560 --> 43:58.480
and how many people he can bring round.

43:58.640 --> 44:02.400
I hope next time we’ll have doubled the number of people

44:02.560 --> 44:06.720
that are here from all these eight countries who are hosting now.

44:06.880 --> 44:09.200
All My love to you all.

44:09.360 --> 44:13.840
Great days are waiting us.

44:14.000 --> 44:19.720
We have to now understand only our responsibility.

44:19.880 --> 44:23.400
Main thing is how many people we have converted,

44:23.560 --> 44:25.920
how many people we have resurrected.

44:26.080 --> 44:28.720
That is the record, not what,

44:28.880 --> 44:31.120
how many Pujas you have attended and all that.

44:31.280 --> 44:32.560
It’s not so important.

44:32.720 --> 44:36.200
Pujas are just to give you strength and to give you power,

44:36.360 --> 44:40.400
but they are not your work. That’s not your work.

44:40.560 --> 44:42.920
For your work, you can take from Pujas

44:43.080 --> 44:44.800
all the strength that you need.

44:44.960 --> 44:50.320
But if you don’t use this power, then what’s the use?

44:50.800 --> 44:53.440
So now, I leave it to you to remember

44:53.600 --> 44:57.360
that you are resurrected and you have to resurrect others.

44:57.520 --> 44:59.800
It’s a very, very important job

44:59.960 --> 45:04.480
at this time of complete turmoil and destruction.

45:04.480 --> 45:07.320
May God bless you!
