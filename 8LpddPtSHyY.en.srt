00:00:01,103 --> 00:00:05,135
1999-0508 Entertainment Program,
Sahastrara Puja Weekend, Cabella, Italy

2
02:42:57,114 --> 02:43:04,953
Sometimes the words fail to express

3
02:43:07,371 --> 02:43:15,248
the feelings of great gratitude for all
of you -

4
02:43:15,748 --> 02:43:20,272
for putting up this collective effort

5
02:43:20,473 --> 02:43:30,980
and such a beautiful concentrated work
as a real piece of art.

6
02:43:31,181 --> 02:43:37,863
I had seen “Magic Flute” long time back,
when I was in Berlin,

7
02:43:38,064 --> 02:43:45,616
and that time – of course I didn’t
understand German language,

8
02:43:45,817 --> 02:43:54,721
but I absolutely got lost by the rhythm,
the music, the tuning and everything.

9
02:43:54,922 --> 02:43:59,714
So, actually the way you have brought
in that

10
02:43:59,915 --> 02:44:06,209
very, very beautiful piece of art to life –

11
02:44:06,410 --> 02:44:12,876
I feel so much grateful to you that you are
all Sahaja Yogis,

12
02:44:13,077 --> 02:44:24,204
and to Sahaja Yogis to perform this kind
of magnificent, tremendous art piece,

13
02:44:24,405 --> 02:44:31,053
I don’t know whom to thank, really.
Because now I can see our future,

14
02:44:31,254 --> 02:44:36,983
we’ll be going all over the world,
taking this music.

15
02:44:37,184 --> 02:44:42,029
And may not be this one, may be
another one,

16
02:44:42,230 --> 02:44:49,426
but you are all such a great group that
you can really surpass everybody else

17
02:44:49,627 --> 02:44:53,767
who are having all these operas everywhere.

18
02:44:53,968 --> 02:44:58,876
Actually I would say in London it’s very
easy to get that hall

19
02:44:59,077 --> 02:45:03,824
which is mostly used for operas,
the Royal Albert Hall.

20
02:45:04,025 --> 02:45:10,570
So we can reserve for you that, and we’ll
have the whole thing done.

21
02:45:10,771 --> 02:45:17,085
I mean, I could never imagine that
you were such masters.

22
02:45:17,364 --> 02:45:22,345
I shouldn’t say professionals, but
really masters.

23
02:45:22,546 --> 02:45:28,439
And the way you all concentrated. This is
the main point of collective playing

24
02:45:28,640 --> 02:45:31,935
is that there should be complete
concentration.

25
02:45:32,136 --> 02:45:37,512
I just wanted to test you, so I said,
“Sing also Binati Suniye”.

26
02:45:37,713 --> 02:45:40,977
But despite that you came back
to your normal

27
02:45:41,178 --> 02:45:44,710
and you were doing everything so well,
even after that;

28
02:45:44,911 --> 02:45:49,571
I don’t know how to congratulate you
and all of you

29
02:45:49,772 --> 02:45:59,348
who have taken to it, worked together,
in such unison and with such clarity.

30
02:46:00,200 --> 02:46:08,143
I must say, I would say it was even better
than the one I had seen, much better.

31
02:46:09,185 --> 02:46:15,738
You see, because I couldn’t even understand
the language, apart from that,

32
02:46:15,939 --> 02:46:21,304
it was little they, I felt, they were
little confused comparatively,

33
02:46:21,505 --> 02:46:25,627
while you people were straight, absolutely
could see what you were doing,

34
02:46:25,828 --> 02:46:30,727
and what you were performing, and what
you were giving.

35
02:46:30,895 --> 02:46:34,660
Now I see your future, the future
of Sahaja Yoga.

36
02:46:34,861 --> 02:46:39,330
Through you people, the glory of Sahaja
Yoga will spread.

37
02:46:39,531 --> 02:46:44,989
But when we have the program we’ll have
all formal dresses and all formalities,

38
02:46:45,190 --> 02:46:49,658
and I’m sure - I bless you from My heart -
that we’ll have the complete

39
02:46:49,859 --> 02:47:00,049
of this particular play by Mozart.
Complete.

40
02:47:00,250 --> 02:47:06,518
And we’ll do it so well, I know, and people
will know that what Sahaja Yoga can do

41
02:47:06,719 --> 02:47:13,094
to your collectivity by which you can
achieve it – because this collectivity

42
02:47:13,295 --> 02:47:17,746
you can’t have in any other form
of performance.

43
02:47:17,947 --> 02:47:23,602
This has to be all of you, the players,
singers,

44
02:47:23,803 --> 02:47:27,678
then the dialogues and everything
has to be in unison.

45
02:47:27,879 --> 02:47:33,701
In Maharashtra, in Marathi, we have dramas
of this kind,

46
02:47:33,902 --> 02:47:39,798
which can be called as operas, but apart
from that, there is lot of –

47
02:47:39,999 --> 02:47:48,540
what you can say – dialogues which are not
in the tune or in the music form.

48
02:47:48,741 --> 02:47:53,422
So also they speak and tell you something
in between.

49
02:47:53,623 --> 02:48:01,512
But they are also very enjoyable and they
are thinking of having opera in Maharashtra.

50
02:48:01,713 --> 02:48:05,508
But now let – when they’ll see you then
I think they’ll give up the idea,

51
02:48:05,709 --> 02:48:08,993
they can’t do that well, I’m sure.

52
02:48:09,194 --> 02:48:16,355
In any case Austria is a place, is the –
I think is the origin, is the distribution,

53
02:48:16,556 --> 02:48:24,137
is the complete sky of Western classical
music, no doubt about it.

54
02:48:24,338 --> 02:48:29,183
And you all are all really based into it.

55
02:48:29,384 --> 02:48:34,371
The way you have played and the way
you have sung

56
02:48:34,572 --> 02:48:37,844
is very remarkable, it has touched
My heart.

57
02:48:38,045 --> 02:48:43,536
I wish you had the complete seventy-five
minutes program,

58
02:48:43,737 --> 02:48:49,153
but the problem is that supposing you have
one day for this, then it’s all right.

59
02:48:49,354 --> 02:48:57,596
No, as it is, we have only two days in that
this cannot be fully expressed.

60
02:48:57,797 --> 02:49:03,862
But we’ll arrange a program, we’ll
definitely arrange a program

61
02:49:04,063 --> 02:49:07,812
in, say, Albert Hall I think, it’s easy
to get.

62
02:49:08,013 --> 02:49:10,852
I [mean] we get it every time, again
we’ll get this time.

63
02:49:11,053 --> 02:49:14,458
And I’m sure they will be very impressed.

64
02:49:14,659 --> 02:49:20,101
Because they don’t know what music
you have in your country

65
02:49:20,302 --> 02:49:24,870
and how much people know and how much
they can sing so well.

66
02:49:25,071 --> 02:49:31,253
It’s something very rare, you don’t
understand, I feel it because

67
02:49:31,454 --> 02:49:36,602
I must say I’m not so much used to operas,

68
02:49:36,803 --> 02:49:41,797
and whatever operas I have seen, this is
thousand times better than that.

69
02:49:41,998 --> 02:49:46,871
So I’m really amazed at your achievement.
I don’t know if it is Sahaj Yog

70
02:49:47,072 --> 02:49:54,071
that has helped you, but this collective,
collective singing, is the biggest thing.

71
02:49:54,272 --> 02:49:57,477
Collective, in tune with all other
musicians,

72
02:49:57,678 --> 02:50:02,079
it’s really very, very great and this
unison, this oneness,

73
02:50:02,280 --> 02:50:07,241
if it is through Sahaj Yog, I’m very happy
about it.

74
02:50:07,442 --> 02:50:12,247
We are all overly satisfied and I can see
your future –

75
02:50:12,448 --> 02:50:18,899
it will be a great future for all of you.
We shouldn’t take so much of botheration

76
02:50:19,100 --> 02:50:25,059
about how we’ll do it and how will it work
out – it will, it will work out.

77
02:50:25,260 --> 02:50:29,719
Your desire is much stronger than
the desire of any other artist.

78
02:50:29,920 --> 02:50:34,230
So just desire, it will all work out and
we’ll show to them

79
02:50:34,431 --> 02:50:39,831
how Sahaja Yoga can create such
beautiful music.

80
02:50:40,032 --> 02:50:46,616
So thank you very much, and I thank from
all others the way you have entertained us

81
02:50:46,817 --> 02:50:56,288
with this beautiful music and such great
hopes of a future expressions of your art.

82
02:50:56,489 --> 02:50:59,743
May God bless you.

83
02:51:03,265 --> 02:51:13,224
Then Slovakia people are also another
very great geniuses,

84
02:51:13,425 --> 02:51:19,691
yesterday we saw their drama and today
again we saw – I’m amazed absolutely.

85
02:51:19,892 --> 02:51:25,865
Is it Sahaja Yoga that has made them so
good in art? The creativity was so great

86
02:51:26,066 --> 02:51:33,060
and their play, drama was so beautiful.
So beautifully rendered;

87
02:51:33,261 --> 02:51:38,678
yesterday also, today also. I mean, they
are such dramatist I didn’t know, I mean,

88
02:51:38,879 --> 02:51:44,757
how could they be that confident
of their acting and everything,

89
02:51:44,958 --> 02:51:50,198
is really remarkable. When I was young
I used to act also in dramas,

90
02:51:50,399 --> 02:51:57,606
and I used to get first prize mostly.
Maybe I quite

91
02:51:58,631 --> 02:52:05,586
disguised Myself as something else,
but the, you see, the art,

92
02:52:05,787 --> 02:52:11,253
art of acting was so great even with them,

93
02:52:11,454 --> 02:52:16,306
I was surprised how they could freely
act so well.

94
02:52:16,507 --> 02:52:21,986
Again I would say if it is Sahaj Yog,
carry on, carry on with Sahaja Yoga.

95
02:52:22,187 --> 02:52:28,594
And I’m sure this creativity, the blessings
of Saraswati will be upon you;

96
02:52:28,795 --> 02:52:36,928
and we’ll have even bigger dramas
and bigger -

97
02:52:37,129 --> 02:52:43,218
we should say – expositions somewhere,
maybe later on

98
02:52:43,419 --> 02:52:49,713
we can have it in India, or have it
in America, anywhere.

99
02:52:49,914 --> 02:52:57,005
So I see all that before Me, and you’ll be
very well-known artists, all of you;

100
02:52:57,206 --> 02:53:07,324
even the Slovakia people have great talent
I must say. Such a great talent!

101
02:53:07,525 --> 02:53:14,211
This talent is a special gift of God, no
doubt. But to combine it, to express it,

102
02:53:14,412 --> 02:53:20,141
to work it out in such a collective manner,
is something very different

103
02:53:20,342 --> 02:53:26,933
and very beautiful, and it really made Me
feel very confident about you people,

104
02:53:27,134 --> 02:53:30,884
that one day through you Sahaja Yoga
will spread all over the world,

105
02:53:31,085 --> 02:53:38,207
and people will start knowing this Sahaj
orchestra and Sahaj artists.

106
02:53:38,408 --> 02:53:45,443
It’s really great, very great, and I bless
you from My heart for that.

107
02:53:47,621 --> 02:53:52,017
Then we had some other programs of this,
like Kathak dance,

108
02:53:52,218 --> 02:53:57,027
and also I’m amazed that a German girl
can dance so well that Kathak.

109
02:53:57,228 --> 02:54:02,210
It’s not easy, it’s very difficult. And
rhythmic sense, and all the expression

110
02:54:02,411 --> 02:54:06,990
and everything – she was so delicately
doing it, I was surprised.

111
02:54:07,191 --> 02:54:11,066
I never thought that German girls could
be that delicate, but really,

112
02:54:11,267 --> 02:54:15,307
they are so delicate and so beautifully
expressing

113
02:54:15,513 --> 02:54:24,515
the, all the delicacies of a lady
in her dancing, is…

114
02:54:24,716 --> 02:54:32,055
All – I don’t want to take your time
describing all of them,

115
02:54:32,256 --> 02:54:36,760
but one after another every program
has been great.

116
02:54:36,961 --> 02:54:45,111
And the way you are now depicting
those great musicians

117
02:54:45,311 --> 02:54:50,426
is something very creditable. Because world
has forgotten them.

118
02:54:50,634 --> 02:54:55,192
They want pop music, cheap music,
easy music –

119
02:54:55,393 --> 02:55:00,198
but once you start establishing it,
the vibrations will flow

120
02:55:00,399 --> 02:55:07,463
and people will realise how great this
music was and was lost.

121
02:55:07,664 --> 02:55:11,071
So this trend that is in the whole world

122
02:55:11,272 --> 02:55:18,667
is to become cheapish and to become
something very, very superficial,

123
02:55:18,868 --> 02:55:24,386
will be curbed by your own dedication
and your own expressions,

124
02:55:24,587 --> 02:55:28,175
which will definitely make the vibrations
flow to the audience,

125
02:55:28,376 --> 02:55:33,703
and they will enjoy it very much.
Because you are now divine people,

126
02:55:33,904 --> 02:55:39,161
so your rendering is very different from
others, at least I felt that way.

127
02:55:39,362 --> 02:55:44,222
I felt – gave Me such great joy,
such great joy

128
02:55:44,423 --> 02:55:47,893
that I didn’t get from all other operas
I have seen,

129
02:55:48,094 --> 02:55:55,811
and somehow I couldn’t understand
the way they were

130
02:55:56,012 --> 02:56:00,828
quite confused I felt, not so well
organized as you people are.

131
02:56:01,029 --> 02:56:05,358
So, My blessings again and again
for all of you,

132
02:56:05,559 --> 02:56:12,981
and the way this program has been arranged
by these countries is I’m thankful to them,

133
02:56:13,182 --> 02:56:20,011
to their leaders, and to all of them that
they have done a very great job.

134
02:56:20,212 --> 02:56:23,735
So many people have come from other
countries also here,

135
02:56:23,936 --> 02:56:31,079
and they should also take a lesson,
and try to develop this style

136
02:56:31,280 --> 02:56:37,769
of combining music and expressing
their great,

137
02:56:37,970 --> 02:56:42,117
very great artists, that they have their
own compound (? Unclear word).

138
02:56:42,318 --> 02:56:52,934
I’m trying to get one of our Indian
if you say an opera-style thing here,

139
02:56:53,135 --> 02:56:58,696
but it’s very difficult to get so many
people. But you would enjoy that, really.

140
02:56:58,897 --> 02:57:04,558
So let us see if I could manage sometime
a group of people who will come

141
02:57:04,759 --> 02:57:08,444
and give you a kind of an opera
as you have.

142
02:57:08,645 --> 02:57:12,152
Thank you very much.
