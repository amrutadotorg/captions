00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.030
But as Kundalini rises, on every center

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.360
you start getting the light of that center.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.620
At the first center you get back your innocence,

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:27.390
your eyes become innocent, your behavior becomes innocent,

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.130
you are not filled with lust and greed,

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.140
you don’t look at things with lust and greed,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.610
but you look at things with innocence,

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.359
which is a very big thing that people have lost

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:45.320
and that you get back and such a person develops many qualities.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.021
One of them is that such a person is full of fragrance,

00:00:51.141 --> 00:00:56.539
such a person has a tremendous gravity,

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.916
tremendous gravity, and such a person has tremendous dynamism,

00:01:03.035 --> 00:01:07.080
and attraction is a bad word so I don’t want to use it,

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.430
but magnetical.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.190
His magnets is awakened within him,

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.490
this is the center of your magnet of the earth.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.320
Such a person develops a tremendous sense of roads

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.430
and sense of direction, you place him anywhere

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.994
he will know where to go. Like birds, you place birds anywhere

00:01:32.114 --> 00:01:34.600
they know which side is north, south, east, west.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.430
In the same way you also develop your lost innocence

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.460
and your magnet within you by which you have proper direction;

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.880
but the highest of all you develop the proper direction

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.662
to wisdom which is the wise thing to do.

00:01:54.782 --> 00:01:59.000
You just don’t do stupid things, you just don’t do,

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.420
even if you ever try to do it, you will not do it,

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.666
because you know it is so stupid, just you don’t do it.

00:02:07.786 --> 00:02:13.350
I mean it is so simple to be wise than to be stupid,

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.710
because if you have to be stupid you have to go out of the way

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.999
to be stupid and idiotic; but if you want to be

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:25.190
normal and wise is the easiest thing to do.

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.020
But what people do is to do things that would make them

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.830
more and more stupid, nonsensical,

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.160
because also some people told Me they do it,

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.290
the reason being they think they have a nuisance value.

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.701
Like in London now we have one funny stuff going on,

00:02:47.821 --> 00:02:51.848
they call it what? “Punk rock.” You see, it’s a funny stuff.

00:02:51.968 --> 00:02:55.001
Now poor kids they don’t know what they are doing it,

00:02:55.121 --> 00:03:00.999
and I think the only value of that punk rock system is this:

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:08.900
that they try to sort of make a nuisance out of them

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.170
so that people feel attracted towards them

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.320
or sort of a significance out of them.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.639
But when you become a realized soul you realize your significance,

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:23.400
because you understand you are part and parcel of the whole

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:29.529
and that your significance is to give Realization to others,

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:31.804
the highest of highest,

00:03:31.924 --> 00:03:34.639
that’s what you have to do now you are a saint,

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:39.389
and that’s how the whole attitude of cheapiness,

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:42.919
of outward shallowness finishes

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:47.420
and you become a serene, dignified personality.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.327
This is not possible through any sermon, any lecture,

00:03:51.447 --> 00:03:54.249
it’s only possible when the Kundalini rises

00:03:54.369 --> 00:04:01.708
you become like a very dignified child, very dignified child.

00:04:01.828 --> 00:04:05.620
I’ve seen one beautiful painting done

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.938
of Mother Mary being taught first time.

00:04:11.058 --> 00:04:15.643
You see Her as a child, She is a very dignified personality,

00:04:15.763 --> 00:04:17.916
as a child, She is about ten years of age.

00:04:18.036 --> 00:04:21.507
I’ve seen My own grandchildren who are not very old

00:04:21.627 --> 00:04:24.198
but extremely dignified.

00:04:24.318 --> 00:04:27.460
They walk like kings, behave like kings.

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.925
In every behavior you find there’s such a dignity,

00:04:31.045 --> 00:04:34.698
they’ll never do something shallow, they never ask for anything,

00:04:34.818 --> 00:04:37.328
they never weep for anything, they never cry for anything,

00:04:37.448 --> 00:04:40.885
they are so dignified and they understand it so well

00:04:41.005 --> 00:04:43.727
what is dignity is. I don’t have to tell them,

00:04:43.847 --> 00:04:45.369
because they are born realized,

00:04:45.489 --> 00:04:49.771
in the same way you become, nobody has to tell you

00:04:49.891 --> 00:04:52.604
that “do this, or do that,” but you understand

00:04:52.724 --> 00:04:57.644
that you must have self-respect. This happens to you automatically,

00:04:57.764 --> 00:05:00.760
this is actualization, nobody has to tell you

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.722
that “you be dignified,” you just become.

00:05:02.842 --> 00:05:05.514
I’ve seen people who were absolutely absurd,

00:05:05.634 --> 00:05:08.495
even from this punk rock we got some people

00:05:08.615 --> 00:05:12.687
and they were so changed that people could not recognize them,

00:05:12.807 --> 00:05:15.777
but one thing bad has happened with this punk rock

00:05:15.901 --> 00:05:19.043
that they put some sort of dye in their head

00:05:19.163 --> 00:05:22.025
and since then their eyes became very weak,

00:05:22.145 --> 00:05:26.152
because these dyes I think made the optic globe

00:05:26.272 --> 00:05:29.414
covered with some sort of a color

00:05:29.534 --> 00:05:32.246
and you can’t see properly, and the eyes became very weak

00:05:32.366 --> 00:05:36.028
and it took some time for us to remove the effect

00:05:36.148 --> 00:05:38.324
of those dyes from their head.

00:05:38.444 --> 00:05:42.010
We go headlong, “what’s wrong?” There is nothing wrong

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.870
in this world if it is a stupid fool,

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.691
but for a wise man there are very many things

00:05:47.811 --> 00:05:51.633
which are absolutely wrong, and there are very many things

00:05:51.753 --> 00:05:54.594
which are absolutely correct,

00:05:54.714 --> 00:05:58.425
so you develop your wisdom by this first center.
