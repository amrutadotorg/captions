00:01:14.476 --> 00:01:16.893
Sahaja yogis should not fall to such a level

00:01:17.434 --> 00:01:21.768
of mundane type of people after all what is going to happen to you

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.185
I would say those who have been worrying and all that,

00:01:26.227 --> 00:01:28.684
should go into great meditation and understand

00:01:28.726 --> 00:01:32.601
that you are insulting yourself. You are saints;

00:01:32.643 --> 00:01:34.851
why should you worry about what plane you are going to get,

00:01:34.893 --> 00:01:38.976
what you are not going to get? Shows that your level is very low;

00:01:39.018 --> 00:01:41.434
definitely; all those who have worried.

00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:47.976
You have come here under My protection,

00:01:48.018 --> 00:01:58.684
and you will go back under My protection.

00:01:58.726 --> 00:02:01.601
we’ll not have any pujas. You must know

00:02:01.601 --> 00:02:07.268
that you are all part and parcel of My being;

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:15.518
I have put you in My body and you have to behave yourself.

00:02:15.518 --> 00:02:25.434
so in such an auspicious day when we all have come here

00:02:25.476 --> 00:02:34.185
to do this special puja, and I would say this should be called

00:02:34.227 --> 00:02:39.102
as a Mahalakshmi Puja because it’s something to do

00:02:39.102 --> 00:02:43.018
with the industry of this country, and of the whole world.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:53.060
Unless and until all those human ventures are connected with God

00:02:53.102 --> 00:02:58.893
they cannot get their perfect stage and their status.

00:02:58.935 --> 00:03:02.684
That’s why we have problems now in the West.

00:03:02.726 --> 00:03:05.810
Supposed to be very clever people, very smart,

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.726
very well equipped, well educated. We are having recessions

00:03:10.768 --> 00:03:13.768
and things because they have no balance.

00:03:13.768 --> 00:03:19.227
They don’t know that there is God’s power which works everything,

00:03:19.268 --> 00:03:23.559
and when you neglect that, this is what happens to you.

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:35.227
Now for any venture that we do of this kind,

00:03:35.227 --> 00:03:40.559
first of all we have to use a lot of material from the Mother Earth,

00:03:40.601 --> 00:03:48.102
but if it is taken for a proper purpose, for constructive things

00:03:48.143 --> 00:03:53.018
and for helping others, with a balance,

00:03:53.060 --> 00:04:00.684
then Mother Earth can think, She can produce, more and more,

00:04:00.684 --> 00:04:03.143
all this She has produced before.

00:04:03.185 --> 00:04:05.935
She can produce for people who are sensible,

00:04:05.976 --> 00:04:15.643
who are in tune with God, not just making money for themselves,

00:04:15.684 --> 00:04:27.143
or for their own purpose, but are thinking in totality,

00:04:27.143 --> 00:04:32.684
thinking as to what we can achieve by doing this.

00:04:32.726 --> 00:04:39.185
And that is how an industry can grow.

00:04:39.227 --> 00:04:42.684
Now we see in Japan so much industry has grown,

00:04:42.726 --> 00:04:47.726
but no spirituality. They are not at all happy people.

00:04:47.768 --> 00:04:53.893
Their children are suffering, families are suffering.

00:04:53.893 --> 00:05:02.060
Money cannot get the total well being of a human being.

00:05:02.102 --> 00:05:06.268
So a balance has to be drawn.

00:05:06.268 --> 00:05:11.185
Especially in our country, thank God, we didn’t have

00:05:11.185 --> 00:05:16.935
such a fast industrialization, and that’s why we are saved

00:05:16.935 --> 00:05:19.643
of lots of problems that the Western people are suffering,

00:05:19.684 --> 00:05:22.268
about which the Indians are not aware.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.976
They think you are all living in a very comfortable life there.

00:05:27.018 --> 00:05:35.185
Industry has to go hand-in-hand with the handicrafts,

00:05:35.185 --> 00:05:42.185
and the industrialists have to also look after the artists,

00:05:42.227 --> 00:05:45.935
because otherwise who will look after them?

00:05:45.976 --> 00:05:49.893
How will they bring forth the balance between the art and the industry?

00:05:49.935 --> 00:05:55.268
And art is such a soothing thing for these hard-working people.

00:05:55.268 --> 00:05:59.185
They work the whole day, then there is some sort of a music,

00:05:59.185 --> 00:06:09.143
art, to console them, to give them peace, to relax them,

00:06:09.185 --> 00:06:16.643
and a balance. So I would say that all industries

00:06:16.684 --> 00:06:23.643
must take to some artistic ventures also, or they should also produce things.

00:06:23.643 --> 00:06:28.060
After I was telling Rajesh many a times that you should try to produce

00:06:28.102 --> 00:06:33.601
something artistic out of the steel scrap that is left over, will be a good idea.

00:06:33.601 --> 00:06:35.476
They have tried something like that.

00:06:35.518 --> 00:06:42.851
But industry should not be looked down upon

00:06:42.893 --> 00:06:45.310
as it is looked down upon in our country.

00:06:45.352 --> 00:06:47.893
I mean, as if industrialists are the greatest thieves

00:06:47.935 --> 00:06:53.143
and all the politicians are saints in this country. It’s the other way around I think.

00:06:53.143 --> 00:06:55.893
It should be treated with respect,

00:06:55.935 --> 00:06:58.060
and should be understood that it’s very important.

00:06:58.102 --> 00:07:03.643
And the industrialists, if they become also enlightened,

00:07:03.643 --> 00:07:10.018
they can do a lot, not only to their own country,

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.893
but also to the people whom they are looking after.

00:07:12.935 --> 00:07:15.851
So in the Mahalakshmi principle,

00:07:15.893 --> 00:07:20.143
Mahalakshmi has various mudras.

00:07:20.185 --> 00:07:27.976
One of the mudra is that She puts Her right hand like this.

00:07:27.976 --> 00:07:33.434
Now this right hand is to give protection to people

00:07:33.434 --> 00:07:39.893
who are under the protection, or under the service,

00:07:39.893 --> 00:07:42.726
of some rich man, or the industrialist we can call it.

00:07:42.726 --> 00:07:46.810
In India if you call somebody a rich man it’s like abusing him.

00:07:46.851 --> 00:07:50.601
Nobody likes it, because the rich are always shown

00:07:50.643 --> 00:07:53.102
to be the worst people, which is not so.

00:07:53.143 --> 00:07:57.393
In My own experience it’s not so. If there’s a poor man also he could be terrible.

00:07:57.434 --> 00:08:00.726
We have had very bad experiences now, in Ganapatipule,

00:08:00.768 --> 00:08:02.893
of very poor people how they behaved

00:08:02.935 --> 00:08:06.559
in a very funny manner - supposed to be poor.

00:08:06.601 --> 00:08:17.559
So it should be a proper balance, it should be brought to a proper balance,

00:08:17.559 --> 00:08:23.060
between the understanding of the poor and the rich, and the rich and the poor.

00:08:23.102 --> 00:08:31.060
After some time you will find that people will not consider poverty

00:08:31.102 --> 00:08:37.810
or riches as so important, but the richness of the spirit

00:08:37.851 --> 00:08:40.268
will become very important.

00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:43.392
That is what is going to be the Sahaj nations

00:08:43.392 --> 00:08:47.976
where the richness of the heart, the spirituality,

00:08:47.976 --> 00:08:53.185
oneness with the Divine, will become the greatest boon

00:08:53.227 --> 00:08:59.684
for everyone. But still we are struggling

00:08:59.726 --> 00:09:06.601
to be on that state; many are; and still we go into materialistic tantrums

00:09:06.643 --> 00:09:12.643
or some sort of a stupid worrying fall.

00:09:12.684 --> 00:09:16.227
All these must be carefully watched.

00:09:16.268 --> 00:09:23.434
If you can keep this chariot of new progress

00:09:23.476 --> 00:09:25.851
progressing faster

00:09:25.893 --> 00:09:30.102
we are going to create a new world of complete harmony,

00:09:30.102 --> 00:09:35.310
complete peace, joy and love. But for that

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:41.518
you are the ones who have to do it. I cannot do it.

00:09:41.559 --> 00:09:42.851
If I could have done it

00:09:42.851 --> 00:09:44.768
I would not have asked you to join Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:47.643
It’s like the horses and the charioteer;

00:09:47.643 --> 00:09:55.518
horses are to be driven; charioteer doesn’t drive the chariot.

00:09:55.559 --> 00:09:59.976
In the same way you must understand your responsibility

00:09:59.976 --> 00:10:02.684
that this is the greatest work we are doing.

00:10:02.726 --> 00:10:11.476
It’s not only the industry, or the labor and the capital,

00:10:11.518 --> 00:10:15.935
I’m talking about, but I’m talking about the totality of well being.

00:10:15.935 --> 00:10:21.102
Of course all of this is a part and parcel of that, no doubt.

00:10:21.143 --> 00:10:24.893
But the balance should be with the totality.

00:10:24.935 --> 00:10:29.643
So we have to think of a total well being.

00:10:29.684 --> 00:10:33.935
Once we start thinking of the total well being then –

00:10:33.976 --> 00:10:35.601
first thing that should come to us:

00:10:35.601 --> 00:10:40.518
Are we capable of bringing up that total well being? Are we?

00:10:40.518 --> 00:10:46.559
Have we got the total well being within ourselves or not? Have we?

00:10:46.601 --> 00:10:49.227
We are still worried if the plane is coming or not,

00:10:49.227 --> 00:10:52.392
I mean, we are so mundane, so little, so small.

00:10:52.392 --> 00:11:01.434
With one bandhan you can control any plane, any atmosphere,

00:11:01.434 --> 00:11:05.518
and here you are, I mean, still worried about things

00:11:05.559 --> 00:11:08.434
which are absolutely under your control.

00:11:08.476 --> 00:11:13.643
So this totality has to be thought over.

00:11:13.643 --> 00:11:18.018
What is this totality that Mother is talking about?

00:11:18.018 --> 00:11:25.227
In this totality a world has to be created of people,

00:11:25.227 --> 00:11:39.143
by the people, who have no fear. This fear has to be given up.

00:11:39.185 --> 00:11:42.684
Behind all this nonsensical nervousness is fear.

00:11:42.684 --> 00:11:50.601
So for that, what She does is to give  Avaida

00:11:50.643 --> 00:11:57.352
Under Her protection you are beyond fear, you are protected.

00:11:57.392 --> 00:12:00.393
But if you do not want to believe in yourself,

00:12:00.434 --> 00:12:06.434
and you don’t believe into Her protection, then no body can help you,

00:12:06.476 --> 00:12:09.893
because everything is mythical for you.

00:12:09.935 --> 00:12:20.102
In every venture that we take up we should not have any fear

00:12:20.143 --> 00:12:26.060
because God is with you. Is a fact, is the truth. You just try.

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:32.518
But when you try through your ego you fall into the trap of fear.

00:12:32.518 --> 00:12:36.143
I have seen egoistical people are the most frightened people,

00:12:36.185 --> 00:12:39.643
and panicked, because they panic others

00:12:39.684 --> 00:12:42.935
and so they think they can be panicked one day.

00:12:42.935 --> 00:12:47.392
When the English were here, first of all, in India,

00:12:47.392 --> 00:12:52.060
we were all frightened of them. Now I see

00:12:52.102 --> 00:12:56.143
that in England every English family is frightened of others.

00:12:56.143 --> 00:12:59.768
They’ll only open a chink of the door to see who is there,

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:04.102
and shut it. They’re so frightened. I’m surprised,

00:13:04.143 --> 00:13:06.143
they are the same English who ruled us here.

00:13:06.143 --> 00:13:08.768
And we were so bewitched before them and now

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:11.060
they are the ones who are frightened of us;

00:13:11.102 --> 00:13:14.434
because when a person who is egoistical tries to dominate others

00:13:14.476 --> 00:13:18.643
he sees himself in the mirror and thinks

00:13:18.643 --> 00:13:20.976
that the other person will dominate him.

00:13:21.018 --> 00:13:24.768
That’s how this fear creeps in, into our minds,

00:13:24.768 --> 00:13:28.976
and we start getting all kinds of these stupid tantrums

00:13:29.018 --> 00:13:32.268
out of this mythical fear.

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:37.310
The fear is created by our ego.

00:13:37.352 --> 00:13:43.476
A person who has no ego, he’ll have no fear

00:13:43.476 --> 00:13:44.976
because he has not harmed anyone.

00:13:45.018 --> 00:13:48.976
Why should he have any fear? And such a man, or such a woman,

00:13:49.018 --> 00:13:52.935
will be looked after by God, because God takes over.

00:13:52.976 --> 00:13:57.851
When you surrender your ego to God He takes over.

00:13:57.893 --> 00:14:01.851
But those who have ego He says, “All right, go ahead,

00:14:01.851 --> 00:14:05.102
use your ego, try to protect yourself, cut your throat.”

00:14:05.102 --> 00:14:13.185
That’s what it is. So when I talk of total benevolence

00:14:13.185 --> 00:14:18.476
I’m talking about your own total benevolence.

00:14:18.518 --> 00:14:20.393
So first is the fear,

00:14:20.434 --> 00:14:23.726
which should go out of your mind completely

00:14:23.768 --> 00:14:28.227
if you believe in the Almighty God. We’ll say,

00:14:28.268 --> 00:14:30.935
“You are Almighty God, you are almighty this thing”

00:14:30.935 --> 00:14:34.559
It's all lip-service. If you believe that God is almighty,

00:14:34.601 --> 00:14:36.352
and you are connected with God,

00:14:36.392 --> 00:14:39.227
then why should you have any fear of anything?

00:14:39.227 --> 00:14:44.185
But when we say, “Don’t have fear,” another extreme comes up,

00:14:44.185 --> 00:14:47.185
“We don’t have fear, we can do what we like,

00:14:47.227 --> 00:14:52.393
we can perform everything ourselves, we need not tell anyone.”

00:14:52.434 --> 00:14:56.518
You have to tell God whatever you are doing.

00:14:56.559 --> 00:15:03.143
You have to take permission, you have to inform in His darbar,

00:15:03.143 --> 00:15:09.810
in His court, that, “Sir, we are thinking of doing such and such thing.”

00:15:09.851 --> 00:15:16.143
But you think you are God. You are not.

00:15:16.185 --> 00:15:20.185
And that’s why the another part of non-fear

00:15:20.227 --> 00:15:23.060
is this kind of an arbitrary behavior

00:15:23.102 --> 00:15:25.601
which is very dangerous for Sahaja Yoga,

00:15:25.643 --> 00:15:28.310
for yourself, and for everybody else.

00:15:28.352 --> 00:15:38.893
The second fear, I mean, I have, is that if I tell you anything,

00:15:38.935 --> 00:15:44.352
ninety-nine percent of you understand is for your benevolence,

00:15:44.392 --> 00:15:47.976
is for your good. But there is one percent of people

00:15:47.976 --> 00:15:53.935
who can just react because they have too much ego and they won’t take it,

00:15:53.935 --> 00:15:56.893
because they don’t think of their own benevolence.

00:15:56.893 --> 00:16:00.768
They don’t understand that if I am telling them anything,

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:08.060
it is just to give them completeness, totality.

00:16:08.102 --> 00:16:12.684
But, on the contrary, they take a very wrong attitude;

00:16:12.684 --> 00:16:17.310
this is another nonsensity. So now one has to develop

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:21.643
a kind of a indifference to this kind of people

00:16:21.643 --> 00:16:26.768
who unnecessarily go to the other limit of their own destruction,

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:30.810
and don’t want to see what is the point in everything

00:16:30.851 --> 00:16:34.060
that I am telling you. Only I can tell you. Who else?

00:16:34.102 --> 00:16:36.643
I have to tell you what’s wrong with you,

00:16:36.643 --> 00:16:39.476
what you have done wrong, and then you must change it.

00:16:39.518 --> 00:16:46.434
This is another style of reaction one gets,

00:16:46.476 --> 00:16:49.018
means they are not interested in their own benevolence,

00:16:49.018 --> 00:16:52.392
they’re not interested in the benevolence of their children,

00:16:52.392 --> 00:16:56.768
they’re not interested in the benevolence of their country or the whole world.

00:16:56.768 --> 00:17:00.643
Now why have you come to Sahaja Yoga? Just ask one question.

00:17:00.643 --> 00:17:05.018
Of course for you to ascend. But ascend for what?

00:17:05.018 --> 00:17:08.810
Supposing we bring one tube light.

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:13.018
For what we have to take the tube light? But for what?

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:16.434
We have to put the light. But this tube light doesn’t give light,

00:17:16.476 --> 00:17:19.851
nothing of the kind, so what’s the use of having this tube light?

00:17:19.893 --> 00:17:24.559
In the same way, what’s the use of coming to Sahaja Yoga

00:17:24.559 --> 00:17:31.643
if you cannot become the light of the Divine?

00:17:31.643 --> 00:17:41.893
So all of you, each one of you, is not at all a small person;

00:17:41.893 --> 00:17:45.102
no one; but you don’t realize what you are;

00:17:45.143 --> 00:17:49.935
still have those funny conditionings by which you think

00:17:49.935 --> 00:17:52.518
you are no good. All of you can come up,

00:17:52.518 --> 00:17:56.810
and see so many people. If they take to total benevolence

00:17:56.851 --> 00:18:04.518
within themselves it will manifest itself outside; absolutely; it’s a fact.

00:18:04.518 --> 00:18:10.268
Then the attention is very important.

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:14.726
The attention should be on your own perfection

00:18:14.768 --> 00:18:21.310
and on your total benevolence. This is also another point people miss,

00:18:21.352 --> 00:18:23.893
that they start finding faults with others

00:18:23.935 --> 00:18:27.518
instead of finding faults with themselves.

00:18:27.559 --> 00:18:33.227
As a result, if you look at others, what will you get out of it?

00:18:33.268 --> 00:18:38.810
I just don’t understand. If somebody is wrong,

00:18:38.851 --> 00:18:42.352
he’s doing something evil, he's bad, even if you put attention to him,

00:18:42.352 --> 00:18:49.060
what will you do about it? But if you have something wrong,

00:18:49.102 --> 00:18:51.559
you have every right, you have every control,

00:18:51.601 --> 00:19:00.227
and you can correct yourself. This is especially Indian quality,

00:19:00.227 --> 00:19:02.392
is to find faults with others.

00:19:02.392 --> 00:19:06.810
They’ll never see that what’s wrong with us.

00:19:06.851 --> 00:19:12.768
All the time the attention is involved in finding with faults with others.

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:19.726
Then how can we improve? On the contrary,

00:19:19.726 --> 00:19:23.684
if you start seeing faults, you get faulty much more.

00:19:23.726 --> 00:19:28.143
It’s a copycat nature of human beings.

00:19:28.185 --> 00:19:30.643
They see somebody doing like this,

00:19:30.684 --> 00:19:33.601
“Oh Mother, he’s a Sahaja yogi, he does like this,

00:19:33.643 --> 00:19:35.810
so what’s the harm if I do?”

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:38.060
But who says he’s a Sahaja yogi?

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:42.018
So ‘Sahaja yogi’ is not a brand, it's not a certificate,

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:48.810
it’s not a kind of a organization, but it is your own status

00:19:48.851 --> 00:19:52.310
that you have achieved. Anybody can say,

00:19:52.352 --> 00:19:55.185
“I’m a Sahaja Yogi.” After all I cannot stop him from saying.

00:19:55.227 --> 00:19:58.185
I’m not such a ...(unclear). Even I have seen some mad people,

00:19:58.185 --> 00:20:00.810
they are Sahaja yogis, for years together they’re mad,

00:20:00.851 --> 00:20:06.810
but they’re Sahaja yogis. But you have to see for yourself,

00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:09.893
am I a Sahaja yogi or not? Before certifying yourself,

00:20:09.935 --> 00:20:16.143
why don’t you find out? But despite that, I must say,

00:20:16.185 --> 00:20:21.601
it's such a satisfaction. I never expected that so many people

00:20:21.643 --> 00:20:24.434
will get their realization to begin with, never.

00:20:24.476 --> 00:20:31.227
I mean, I knew that it was en masse modus operandi I have developed,

00:20:31.227 --> 00:20:36.559
but I never expected. But it has happened,

00:20:36.601 --> 00:20:42.268
and even now I have to expect that all of you

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:47.143
will achieve the highest, highest positions, the paramapada (Sanskrit word),

00:20:47.143 --> 00:20:52.559
as I said, like the North Pole, or like the Meru; absolutely atala (Indian word)

00:20:52.601 --> 00:20:55.726
‘which cannot be disturbed’. So that’s My hope,

00:20:55.768 --> 00:20:58.559
and I’m sure you will all comply with it.

00:20:58.601 --> 00:21:27.392
(Talk continues in Marathi then returns to English)

00:32:12.935 --> 00:32:14.601
I’ll tell you in English. I have told you many a times

00:32:14.601 --> 00:32:17.684
about Namadeva and Gorakumbhar, how Gorakumbhar,

00:32:17.684 --> 00:32:20.976
when he saw Namadeva, Namadeva saw Gorakumbhar

00:32:21.018 --> 00:32:25.434
was kneading the clay for his pottery,

00:32:25.476 --> 00:32:29.227
he just went and stood before him stunned.

00:32:29.227 --> 00:32:37.434
And what he says that, “I have come to see here the formless”

00:32:37.476 --> 00:32:42.434
(that’s the vibrations). “But the Formless is in a form”

00:32:42.476 --> 00:32:46.143
This is the appreciation one should have,

00:32:46.185 --> 00:32:48.185
one Sahaja yogi should have for another.

00:32:48.227 --> 00:32:52.143
Every Sahaja yogi is a gem.

00:32:52.185 --> 00:32:57.601
Even the thought of a gem should bring joy to you.

00:32:57.643 --> 00:33:03.185
In every life, every style, in every areas, every dimensions,

00:33:03.227 --> 00:33:10.684
one should have this kind of a feeling. Muslims, Hindus, Christians,

00:33:10.726 --> 00:33:14.268
we do not accept. For us we are all Sahaja yogis,

00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:18.392
and we have faith in all the religions, not some above.

00:33:18.392 --> 00:33:22.392
We have faith in every thing. As well as we worship Rama

00:33:22.392 --> 00:33:26.893
we worship Muhammad Sahib also, same way, no less.

00:33:26.935 --> 00:33:30.726
As we worship Brahmadeva, or as we worship,

00:33:30.726 --> 00:33:35.559
we say, Dattatreya, we worship Zoroaster, there’s no difference at all,

00:33:35.601 --> 00:33:40.684
same way. There’s a big difference in having just a same,

00:33:40.684 --> 00:33:45.726
what you call, the same respect; it’s not that;

00:33:45.768 --> 00:33:50.227
but we worship the same way, so there’s no question

00:33:50.227 --> 00:33:54.726
of differentiating each other; nor on country-wise, nothing.

00:33:54.726 --> 00:33:58.143
And whatever defects we have, we see to it

00:33:58.185 --> 00:34:00.310
that this has come from our country;

00:34:00.352 --> 00:34:03.726
which I see many Sahaja yogis tell Me, “This is typical English,

00:34:03.768 --> 00:34:07.310
this is typically French, this is typically Italian.”

00:34:07.352 --> 00:34:13.434
They themselves tell Me. But main thing one has to understand is this,

00:34:13.476 --> 00:34:18.268
that in Sahaja Yoga we have lost all these boundaries; nothing is there.

00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:21.392
We have reached that state where we are all one.

00:34:21.393 --> 00:34:26.851
And the idea of any Sahaja yogi whatsoever,

00:34:26.851 --> 00:34:29.684
and any individual Sahaja yogi, or a group of Sahaja yogis,

00:34:29.684 --> 00:34:38.601
should fill you up with joy and a kind of a wave of joy

00:34:38.601 --> 00:34:44.768
which is continuously coming, because they are in the form of joy,

00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:50.393
peace. If this appreciation is reached, then only one can say

00:34:50.434 --> 00:34:55.684
that you are Sahaja yogis, and that is one of the tests I have seen.

00:34:55.726 --> 00:34:58.227
You love Me very much I know, all of you,

00:34:58.227 --> 00:35:02.310
but unless and until you love each other how am I going to be happy?

00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:07.227
So today specially, this Mahalakshmi principle,

00:35:07.268 --> 00:35:12.393
when it is awakened within you, then you get out of a Lakshmi principle,

00:35:12.434 --> 00:35:15.392
which makes you a little selfish maybe, self-centered,

00:35:15.392 --> 00:35:19.268
and you get into a new dimension of searching,

00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:25.559
of searching the higher value system, something beyond,

00:35:25.601 --> 00:35:31.643
without any limitations. And that Mahalakshmi principle

00:35:31.684 --> 00:35:37.060
is really nothing, in essence, if you see, is nothing but you are seeking the universal love,

00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:44.060
in the essence it is that. We don’t love people

00:35:44.102 --> 00:35:47.434
because they belong to some country, because they look like this,

00:35:47.476 --> 00:35:50.268
that this is this; nothing; we love them

00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:56.268
only because they are our part and parcel, we are one with them.

00:35:56.310 --> 00:36:01.060
So those who are today worshipping Mahalakshmi should feel

00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:03.434
how many worshippers of Mahalakshmi are there,

00:36:03.434 --> 00:36:07.310
and they are all our own. It’s such a great feeling.

00:36:07.352 --> 00:36:14.185
Otherwise, in Maharashtra especially, I must say, it was horrible,

00:36:14.227 --> 00:36:18.393
one Sahaja yogi goes to preach in another Sahaj, another district.

00:36:18.434 --> 00:36:26.476
(Background noise) The district leader starts fighting, just like this sound,

00:36:26.476 --> 00:36:31.643
“Who are you to come here? I’m the leader”

00:36:31.684 --> 00:36:39.393
Instead of respecting him, and making him a welcome guest,

00:36:39.434 --> 00:36:44.310
asking him what can you help, there’s a big fight.

00:36:44.352 --> 00:36:50.392
It’s really surprising. How can it happen?

00:36:50.393 --> 00:36:55.684
When Namadeva went to Punjab, Guru Nanak Sahib respected him;

00:36:55.684 --> 00:36:58.102
not only that, but he told him that,

00:36:58.143 --> 00:37:00.851
“You write now in Punjabi language also.”

00:37:00.893 --> 00:37:04.434
I have seen such a big book written by Namadeva. Can you imagine?

00:37:04.434 --> 00:37:09.559
He included all the great saints of Maharashtra in his Granth Sahib,

00:37:09.601 --> 00:37:15.268
because he knew that these are realized souls, they are higher souls.

00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:19.310
But these Sikhs are only reading it; nothing goes into their heads.

00:37:19.352 --> 00:37:24.935
What can you do? So at that time,

00:37:24.935 --> 00:37:28.102
if these saints could love each other,

00:37:28.143 --> 00:37:33.768
could express themselves in such a manner, why not we,

00:37:33.768 --> 00:37:36.185
the Sahaja yogis from all over the world?

00:37:36.227 --> 00:37:41.227
So I would say now, that, let us see, it’s a very nice program of Ras

00:37:41.268 --> 00:37:46.352
(Indian word) we’ll be having, where all the Indian and foreign Sahaja yogis are going to be together,

00:37:46.392 --> 00:37:49.893
and are going to dance together. All such things are there.

00:37:49.935 --> 00:37:54.768
So don’t sit in groups, but mix up with others, know them,

00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:57.935
and this is what we are going to know;

00:37:57.976 --> 00:38:02.893
each and every Sahaja yogi of the whole world.

00:38:02.935 --> 00:38:08.518
Is very important for Me that you should love each other.

00:38:08.559 --> 00:38:13.310
It will really soothe Me the most, it will give Me the greatest joy,

00:38:13.352 --> 00:38:21.185
the greatest achievement, and the fulfillment of My life.

00:38:21.227 --> 00:38:28.935
If somebody is really, definitely wrong, you just write to Me

00:38:28.935 --> 00:38:32.601
and I will know, because immediately I’ll know from vibrations.

00:38:32.643 --> 00:38:34.768
Nobody can befool Me, that’s one thing for sure.

00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:37.060
Some people say that, “Somebody has told this to Mother.

00:38:37.102 --> 00:38:39.352
” Nothing can be told to Mother, you don’t know;

00:38:39.392 --> 00:38:43.018
I am too cunning for all this. Nobody can tell Me anything;

00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:45.434
I know each and every... I play around a little bit,

00:38:45.476 --> 00:38:49.060
but I know each and every person. I give them a chance

00:38:49.102 --> 00:38:51.227
to hang themselves for a time being.

00:38:51.227 --> 00:38:55.518
But never believe that anybody can befool Me, and tell anything.

00:38:55.518 --> 00:39:05.102
I listen to everyone, and you can try that.

00:39:05.143 --> 00:39:09.726
If you love another Sahaja yogi,

00:39:09.726 --> 00:39:14.851
this loving process itself is so joy giving.

00:39:14.893 --> 00:39:22.018
When you first saw Me this time on the stage, you felt that way,

00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:28.559
because this process of loving is the greatest joy-giving thing.

00:39:28.601 --> 00:39:34.392
So be happy, be joyous. If some people are missing the plane,

00:39:34.392 --> 00:39:37.310
well and good, you will live with other Sahaja yogis,

00:39:37.352 --> 00:39:40.768
you are after all, you are somewhere in the world, you are not lost.

00:39:40.768 --> 00:39:44.143
Even if you are in the sea, you are there, on the plane you are there.

00:39:44.143 --> 00:39:49.893
What does it matter? Why is it so important

00:39:49.935 --> 00:39:53.810
that this plane must be reserved, and you must worry about this plane,

00:39:53.851 --> 00:39:56.684
“I must get out at this time” There’s no need.

00:39:56.684 --> 00:40:00.476
Wherever you are you are with Sahaja yogis,

00:40:00.518 --> 00:40:02.352
so why worry?

00:40:02.352 --> 00:40:08.143
You are, that’s the point. Like many people ask Me,

00:40:08.143 --> 00:40:10.684
“Mother You travel so much, how is it You don’t get tired?”

00:40:10.684 --> 00:40:13.310
Because I never think I am travelling, I just think, “I am,”

00:40:13.352 --> 00:40:16.310
that’s all. Whether in the plane or here, or there,

00:40:16.310 --> 00:40:20.768
I am just there. I have to tell Me I am traveling,

00:40:20.768 --> 00:40:26.434
then again I forget. So you are,

00:40:26.476 --> 00:40:30.185
whether you are here or in England, or anywhere,

00:40:30.227 --> 00:40:36.060
or you are here or you are there. So why to worry?

00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:38.851
Specially with the plane - I think there is something wrong

00:40:38.851 --> 00:40:45.018
with the Western genetics - the plane enters into their Kundalini,

00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:49.392
I think, and they go so bizarre with the airplanes.

00:40:49.392 --> 00:40:52.893
Something I’ve never been able to understand it.

00:40:52.893 --> 00:40:56.352
I’ve given them so many lessons to show that don’t do all this nonsense,

00:40:56.392 --> 00:40:58.476
but still they go on doing like this.

00:40:58.518 --> 00:41:01.768
But if I tell them they feel guilty,but again they do it.

00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:05.227
Next time if your plane is eight o’clock,

00:41:05.268 --> 00:41:09.893
go at nine o’clock, the plane will wait for you till ten o’clock,

00:41:09.935 --> 00:41:14.518
take it from Me. It has happened; so many can tell this.

00:41:14.559 --> 00:41:20.601
So many experiences are there. I mean, we haven’t written them down,

00:41:20.643 --> 00:41:24.601
but people know how planes have been delayed for us.

00:41:24.601 --> 00:41:28.768
I have never missed a plane all My life, and when I missed it,

00:41:28.768 --> 00:41:31.310
it was with a purpose; these big things happened.

00:41:31.310 --> 00:41:34.518
So it is important, it’s a drama.

00:41:34.559 --> 00:41:42.310
The worry should be one:

00:41:42.352 --> 00:41:49.935
“Why can’t I love everyone as I love myself?”

00:41:49.935 --> 00:41:57.143
I tell you only this universal love will give you

00:41:57.185 --> 00:42:02.434
that confidence and that higher status.

00:42:02.476 --> 00:42:05.143
Why these saints suffered for you?

00:42:05.143 --> 00:42:09.518
Why did Christ suffer for you?

00:42:09.518 --> 00:42:11.143
Why Muhammad Sahib suffered for you?

00:42:11.185 --> 00:42:13.559
Why anybody talked to you about Dharma?

00:42:13.601 --> 00:42:18.518
Why Gnaneshwara wrote Gnaneshwari? Why?

00:42:18.559 --> 00:42:20.643
What did they get?

00:42:20.684 --> 00:42:27.893
This satisfaction of their expression of universal love.

00:42:27.935 --> 00:42:32.352
All the great poets, William Blake or anyone,

00:42:32.352 --> 00:42:34.601
whatever they have done, it’s just

00:42:34.601 --> 00:42:38.643
because they have this universal love and they want to express it.

00:42:38.684 --> 00:42:40.352
Why not you do it?

00:42:40.392 --> 00:42:45.392
So if you want your Mahalakshmi principle

00:42:45.434 --> 00:42:49.060
to be all the time burning, then please

00:42:49.102 --> 00:42:53.185
see that you love each and every Sahaja yogi.

00:42:53.227 --> 00:42:57.017
That’s the message today. I hope you’ll understand that.

00:42:57.016 --> 00:42:59.850
May God bless you.
