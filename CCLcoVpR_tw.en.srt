1
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:07,066
With all the Ganapatis sitting around me

2
00:00:07,226 --> 00:00:11,085
and you all the ganas sitting in front of me,

3
00:00:11,327 --> 00:00:14,311
I don’t know what to say.

4
00:00:16,827 --> 00:00:20,534
It’s remarkable, very remarkable,

5
00:00:20,694 --> 00:00:25,472
because most of you come from a culture

6
00:00:25,632 --> 00:00:29,402
which has never shown any respect of Shri Ganesh.

7
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:33,500
They never realised how important it was that,

8
00:00:33,999 --> 00:00:37,849
without Shri Ganesha’s qualities,

9
00:00:39,522 --> 00:00:44,593
we cannot achieve anything in our life.

10
00:00:46,937 --> 00:00:54,804
The idea of everyday, moment-to-moment enjoyment has destroyed them.

11
00:00:55,155 --> 00:01:00,468
And also the desire to know the Divine

12
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:12,382
vanishes also in the thin air

13
00:01:13,015 --> 00:01:18,937
because you get lost into this moment-to-moment enjoyment

14
00:01:20,179 --> 00:01:24,405
till you get destructive, completely destroyed.

15
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:33,733
But I really don’t understand how you have achieved this state

16
00:01:34,038 --> 00:01:38,804
where you see [that] the purity is so important to life;

17
00:01:39,304 --> 00:01:47,764
that Ganesha’s qualities, His value system

18
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:54,035
and His innocence are to be imbibed.

19
00:01:58,292 --> 00:02:08,382
I feel very gratified that such a thing has happened now in your lives

20
00:02:08,542 --> 00:02:14,327
and you all are so much in praise for Shri Ganesha.

21
00:02:17,163 --> 00:02:22,846
Shri Ganesha is there from our childhood.

22
00:02:23,006 --> 00:02:26,933
Yesterday you saw the children, how they were so beautiful

23
00:02:27,093 --> 00:02:29,605
and entertained us the most.

24
00:02:29,765 --> 00:02:33,042
Everybody had a smile on their face and I said,

25
00:02:33,202 --> 00:02:38,028
“Don’t laugh,” because if you laugh they feel a little offended

26
00:02:38,303 --> 00:02:41,929
and they think that you are laughing at them.

27
00:02:45,663 --> 00:02:53,101
The enjoyment that we had from that drama of children

28
00:02:53,584 --> 00:02:59,651
was more than what one would expect

29
00:02:59,811 --> 00:03:04,921
from adults doing that kind of a drama just to entertain us.

30
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:10,945
It might be some sort of a very subtle joy of Shri Ganesha

31
00:03:11,105 --> 00:03:13,402
that made us so happy.

32
00:03:14,183 --> 00:03:20,039
We all have Shri Ganesh settled very nicely within ourselves

33
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:27,004
and, in you, awakened; awakened in such a manner

34
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:32,867
that, in your free will also, you do not want to do things

35
00:03:33,027 --> 00:03:36,949
that will go against Shri Ganesha.

36
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:43,445
His manifestation within you is so evident.

37
00:03:43,605 --> 00:03:48,785
you see your faces – they are so beautifully shining,

38
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,777
so very different from other people.

39
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:56,238
One day I was travelling from London

40
00:03:56,964 --> 00:04:02,624
and there was one Indian lady who came to see me and she said,

41
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:08,007
“I was surprised to see your disciples. Their faces were shining

42
00:04:08,167 --> 00:04:15,909
with such light. I have never seen any disciples like that.”

43
00:04:16,581 --> 00:04:21,460
I asked her, “Who are you?”

44
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,491
She said, “I am married in Guru Nanak’s family

45
00:04:25,756 --> 00:04:31,273
and all the people in his family are just the opposite

46
00:04:31,433 --> 00:04:34,308
[of] what Guru Nanak was.”

47
00:04:36,464 --> 00:04:40,808
So I said, “Because they worship Shri Ganesha.”

48
00:04:41,863 --> 00:04:47,226
So she said that, “In our family nobody worships Shri Ganesh.”

49
00:04:47,386 --> 00:04:50,581
I said, “It cannot be possible! How is it?”

50
00:04:51,394 --> 00:04:59,230
They believe in nirakar, in the formless God of chaitanya.

51
00:05:00,331 --> 00:05:04,253
I said, “But who is the source of that chaitanya?

52
00:05:04,597 --> 00:05:07,406
Why don’t they find out who is the source?”

53
00:05:07,566 --> 00:05:12,499
So they said that Nanaka has only talked up to this point.

54
00:05:12,659 --> 00:05:15,425
He’s not talked about the source.

55
00:05:18,995 --> 00:05:21,949
I said, “Better find out,

56
00:05:22,495 --> 00:05:26,874
because in this book maybe some things have been taken away.”

57
00:05:27,034 --> 00:05:32,734
And then somebody gave me a passage where he had described

58
00:05:32,894 --> 00:05:36,855
the innocence, the Deity of Shri Ganesha also.

59
00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:44,636
He had described that the whole Creation was done by the Mother

60
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,609
and not by the Father.

61
00:05:46,769 --> 00:05:49,703
It’s very surprising because nirakaris,

62
00:05:49,863 --> 00:05:55,124
those people, who don’t believe in the forms of God,

63
00:05:55,284 --> 00:05:58,570
always talk of Father, not of the Mother.

64
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:10,339
It is true also about Christianity, also about Islam,

65
00:06:10,753 --> 00:06:15,417
also about the Jews.

66
00:06:16,472 --> 00:06:21,851
All of them, they talk of the Father and not of the Mother,

67
00:06:22,011 --> 00:06:24,409
nor about Shri Ganesh.

68
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:33,578
It seems, in the ancient times they believed in child God,

69
00:06:33,738 --> 00:06:41,398
even in China, even in Greece and also in many other countries

70
00:06:41,558 --> 00:06:47,199
who were supposed to be primitive. But they all believed in the child God.

71
00:06:50,534 --> 00:06:54,835
So now, when we deal with our children,

72
00:06:54,995 --> 00:07:00,882
we should know that they are just like Shri Ganesh:

73
00:07:01,042 --> 00:07:05,323
they are very innocent, very simple;

74
00:07:05,761 --> 00:07:11,343
except in cases sometimes [where] they are affected by some things

75
00:07:11,503 --> 00:07:14,198
and they lose their moorings.

76
00:07:18,058 --> 00:07:25,070
But Shri Ganesha’s greatest contribution to Sahaja Yoga is

77
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:30,136
that He makes you feel My vibrations.

78
00:07:30,574 --> 00:07:37,871
He makes you feel the beauty of purity and simplicity.

79
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:43,011
[It’s] only possible if Shri Ganesha is awakened within you.

80
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:50,265
Also the Kundalini won’t rise without the sanction of this ‘chancellor’.

81
00:07:50,425 --> 00:07:53,722
He’s the one sitting on Mooladhara.

82
00:07:54,495 --> 00:07:58,151
But you should know He is on every chakra.

83
00:07:59,261 --> 00:08:08,718
Innocence cures all the maladies, physical, mental, emotional,

84
00:08:08,878 --> 00:08:11,151
specially the spiritual one.

85
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:16,675
But Shri Ganesha’s quality, the most important, is

86
00:08:18,386 --> 00:08:22,730
that He believes in emitting vibrations,

87
00:08:23,511 --> 00:08:30,261
He believes in projecting His vibrations to everyone.

88
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:40,019
That is the quality now [that] I feel all of you, as Sahaja Yogis, can use.

89
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:48,727
You got your Realisation without any effort I should say.

90
00:08:48,887 --> 00:08:50,581
It was Sahaj.

91
00:08:51,206 --> 00:08:57,710
The life before Self-realisation was different.

92
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,225
You got your transformation

93
00:09:00,385 --> 00:09:10,276
and you have jumped into the new era of Meta Science.

94
00:09:11,312 --> 00:09:13,812
But here now we have to see

95
00:09:13,972 --> 00:09:19,062
whatever we have got, what are we to do with it?

96
00:09:19,222 --> 00:09:24,001
You, of course, know that you have to give Realisations to others,

97
00:09:24,161 --> 00:09:32,382
you have to cure people, you have to love them

98
00:09:32,542 --> 00:09:35,148
and you have to be compassionate

99
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:43,109
but apart from that, now the deliberations about yourself have to start.

100
00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:47,914
That is through Shri Ganesha’s powers that are within you.

101
00:09:48,074 --> 00:09:57,521
You should see that you can emit your powers your energy to others.

102
00:09:57,692 --> 00:10:00,411
You can project it to others.

103
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:08,723
Now, for example, If somebody comes to you, meets you,

104
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:15,747
if you know how to deliberately project your energy.

105
00:10:16,614 --> 00:10:20,905
This is a new type of meditation you have to practise now:

106
00:10:21,065 --> 00:10:25,725
that to emit your energy, project your energy to others.

107
00:10:25,885 --> 00:10:29,256
You don’t have to say anything, you don’t have to talk

108
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:33,913
but just feel deliberately – again I say deliberately.

109
00:10:34,073 --> 00:10:37,014
It’s not sahaj, it’s not spontaneous.

110
00:10:37,174 --> 00:10:39,358
This is what you have to practise,

111
00:10:39,518 --> 00:10:45,932
is to emit your energy of your innocence of Shri Ganesha to others

112
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:51,685
so, when they see you, their innocence would be awakened.

113
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:55,241
Now, for example, say

114
00:10:59,763 --> 00:11:05,285
we had some problems in London and Sahaj Yogis told me,

115
00:11:05,445 --> 00:11:09,202
“Mother, there are still some men are looking at us.”

116
00:11:09,362 --> 00:11:14,905
And some said that, “There are many women who are looking at us.”

117
00:11:15,065 --> 00:11:19,299
It was a mutual sort of a thing going on.

118
00:11:20,729 --> 00:11:28,518
I said, “You can project your energy in such a manner

119
00:11:29,409 --> 00:11:36,639
that that projection will stop all this kind of stupid behaviour of other people

120
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:43,369
and also make them understand, respect you and feel your dignity.”

121
00:11:44,439 --> 00:11:46,370
Not very difficult.

122
00:11:46,721 --> 00:11:51,499
But, on the contrary, as the culture is

123
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:57,464
to attract men and attract women it will diminish.

124
00:11:59,915 --> 00:12:02,788
The energy will diminish.

125
00:12:02,948 --> 00:12:09,901
When you feel your own dignity and serenity

126
00:12:11,002 --> 00:12:16,849
and [realise] that you are now Self-realised people,

127
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:19,333
you are not ordinary people

128
00:12:19,493 --> 00:12:24,806
a kind of majestic personality develops within you.

129
00:12:25,548 --> 00:12:34,552
That majestic personality really can have a tremendous effect

130
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:38,204
on the surrounding people – tremendous!

131
00:12:39,571 --> 00:12:43,325
It’s a kind of a deliberate projection you should start.

132
00:12:43,485 --> 00:12:49,381
I don’t know that side, that how to project it

133
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:52,817
or how to deliberately do this.

134
00:12:52,977 --> 00:12:56,052
It’s just spontaneous with me, it just happens.

135
00:12:56,212 --> 00:12:59,669
But you can achieve it yourself with [a] little practice.

136
00:12:59,829 --> 00:13:12,005
Try to face such people, not with disdain or contempt,

137
00:13:12,165 --> 00:13:16,212
but just your majestic personality.

138
00:13:17,227 --> 00:13:21,071
This personality is here now, you see,

139
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:25,711
is sitting in such a majestic manner

140
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:32,997
and is also giving the vibrations to others.

141
00:13:33,157 --> 00:13:42,462
The whole figure is doing something suddenly to people.

142
00:13:44,784 --> 00:13:49,591
To expect that the whole world will change spontaneously,

143
00:13:49,751 --> 00:13:52,954
I don’t think is alright.

144
00:13:53,259 --> 00:13:58,528
Because, you know, the world is so chaotic, full of so much chaos,

145
00:13:58,688 --> 00:14:02,055
so much ego, so much conditioning.

146
00:14:02,602 --> 00:14:09,872
But something within you can rise above others

147
00:14:10,032 --> 00:14:20,454
with your sense of dignity, with your complete Selfhood,

148
00:14:20,891 --> 00:14:23,122
where you stand with yourself.

149
00:14:23,282 --> 00:14:27,059
You are not to be rude, you are not to be egoistical,

150
00:14:27,219 --> 00:14:31,864
you need not say things if you don’t want to say anything.

151
00:14:32,024 --> 00:14:40,071
Just that silent personality can emit such beautiful vibrations,

152
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,338
which you have. You have stored up a lot of vibrations within yourself.

153
00:14:45,498 --> 00:14:52,107
And this storing up is showing on your faces, which I said are shining.

154
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,718
But the innocence that you have,

155
00:14:56,601 --> 00:15:01,745
you have to be proud of it, very much proud of it.

156
00:15:01,905 --> 00:15:08,967
Even now sometimes you feel that people will say

157
00:15:09,127 --> 00:15:12,935
you are not properly dressed up

158
00:15:13,095 --> 00:15:16,471
or maybe you are ugly looking or all kinds of things

159
00:15:16,631 --> 00:15:19,737
that they expect every other person to be.

160
00:15:19,897 --> 00:15:22,931
It’s a funny thing that in this world

161
00:15:23,092 --> 00:15:26,440
all human beings expect others to be very good.

162
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,917
Everybody should be a hero or something

163
00:15:29,077 --> 00:15:31,768
– what about themselves they never think!

164
00:15:31,928 --> 00:15:35,120
So now you have become heroes in the sense that

165
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:39,183
spiritually you are much higher than all of them.

166
00:15:39,343 --> 00:15:44,800
So this projection, when it starts – I am saying again ‘deliberate’ –

167
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:49,651
then you should not be afraid that, “I will develop my ego.”

168
00:15:49,811 --> 00:15:52,854
You should not be afraid that, “I’ll get some conditionings.”

169
00:15:53,014 --> 00:15:58,472
But just, in the way, with the understanding,

170
00:15:58,632 --> 00:16:04,737
that you have these powers within you, beautifully expressing themselves,

171
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:06,866
as a child does.

172
00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:12,995
If there is one child, it can entertain at least hundred people.

173
00:16:13,155 --> 00:16:17,347
What is so sweet about the child? Is the innocence:

174
00:16:17,507 --> 00:16:23,276
the way he speaks, the way he talks, the way he behaves,

175
00:16:23,436 --> 00:16:27,823
the way he expresses his love. It’s so simple

176
00:16:27,983 --> 00:16:36,428
but it has something in the essence, this innocence of Shri Ganesha.

177
00:16:36,936 --> 00:16:42,339
Anywhere there’s a question of children,

178
00:16:42,499 --> 00:16:46,483
the whole world get worried about it,

179
00:16:46,741 --> 00:16:50,581
the whole world wants to solve the problem.

180
00:16:50,741 --> 00:16:56,917
If a child is in trouble, anywhere all over the world

181
00:16:57,077 --> 00:17:01,065
it will be circulated that such and such a thing is happening

182
00:17:01,225 --> 00:17:05,308
to such a child and everybody will be worried.

183
00:17:05,468 --> 00:17:11,214
If they see a child anywhere, the faces change;

184
00:17:11,374 --> 00:17:15,808
you see the faces, the expression changes, automatically.

185
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:20,335
Because that child is emitting that innocence;

186
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:29,112
without any deliberations, without any special way of doing it,

187
00:17:29,272 --> 00:17:31,631
but just spontaneously.

188
00:17:32,499 --> 00:17:39,714
But then you grow, you start growing, growing with others

189
00:17:39,874 --> 00:17:43,612
who are also not innocent. You have to meet them.

190
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:46,612
You can’t run away from the society.

191
00:17:46,772 --> 00:17:54,663
You start getting all the rapport with such people

192
00:17:55,022 --> 00:17:59,410
who are talking about things

193
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:03,565
– actually, those who are criticising Shri Ganesha.

194
00:18:03,725 --> 00:18:07,733
Gradually, your innocence starts dying out

195
00:18:09,186 --> 00:18:12,972
and you feel sometimes inferior to all those

196
00:18:13,132 --> 00:18:18,976
who are supposed to be very great warriors against innocence.

197
00:18:20,858 --> 00:18:27,745
In the sense that – when I was in London

198
00:18:27,905 --> 00:18:32,339
I saw they all used to laugh at me because I had this kumkum.

199
00:18:32,499 --> 00:18:36,339
But I used to think they don’t know why I am wearing it.

200
00:18:36,499 --> 00:18:38,467
So, it’s so ignorant they are:

201
00:18:38,628 --> 00:18:42,222
very ignorant people that they don’t know in India

202
00:18:42,382 --> 00:18:45,347
all the married women have to wear this.

203
00:18:45,507 --> 00:18:50,831
Even the Muslims wear that; they also wear mangalsutra.

204
00:18:50,991 --> 00:18:52,573
So I said that,

205
00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:57,089
“This is just written down, on my head, that I am a married woman.”

206
00:18:57,249 --> 00:19:00,542
It’s just to tell people ‘don’t bother me.

207
00:19:00,702 --> 00:19:06,952
I have got my husband behind me and he can take you to task.’

208
00:19:07,975 --> 00:19:12,886
This kind of ignorance is so much in the West

209
00:19:13,046 --> 00:19:18,151
and still they think they are a higher race, they are greater people.

210
00:19:18,311 --> 00:19:22,850
They don’t know even small, small things about life.

211
00:19:23,397 --> 00:19:26,659
For the innocence, I think

212
00:19:26,819 --> 00:19:31,889
they have lost any knowledge about it, long time back.

213
00:19:34,045 --> 00:19:38,175
And that’s how it is a society, today,

214
00:19:38,335 --> 00:19:44,620
which has absolutely lost its own moorings.

215
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,636
Every individual is separate,

216
00:19:46,796 --> 00:19:51,050
every individual is doing something and they don’t know each other.

217
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:57,417
Without innocence you cannot have a rapport with other people.

218
00:19:57,577 --> 00:20:01,831
Because that means you have some sort of a lust

219
00:20:01,991 --> 00:20:05,276
or greed behind the whole thing.

220
00:20:05,436 --> 00:20:10,933
So much so now, it’s become so boring the whole thing,

221
00:20:11,093 --> 00:20:16,472
that even once I told this Sahaj Yogi that, if you are going there,

222
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:19,987
there’s a family and they have a daughter,

223
00:20:20,147 --> 00:20:24,991
so just give this present to her – a simple thing!

224
00:20:26,108 --> 00:20:30,979
Now this yogi was quite an elderly person, not a young boy.

225
00:20:31,139 --> 00:20:34,464
He said, “Mother, I’d better not go.” I said, “Why?”

226
00:20:34,624 --> 00:20:37,354
“Because they will misunderstand me.”

227
00:20:37,514 --> 00:20:39,198
“What will they misunderstand?”

228
00:20:39,358 --> 00:20:43,425
“Why am I giving a present to this girl?”

229
00:20:43,585 --> 00:20:46,261
I said, “But it’s I am giving. What is the harm?”

230
00:20:46,421 --> 00:20:49,987
“No!” That’s the psychology. He was himself a psychologist.

231
00:20:50,147 --> 00:20:54,526
That’s the psychology. “So I cannot take this present for that girl!”

232
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:59,425
I mean, I was [amazed]: for Indians, you don’t understand this kind of a fear.

233
00:20:59,585 --> 00:21:01,987
But then I noticed it’s too much

234
00:21:02,147 --> 00:21:06,050
that they don’t want to be with any woman,

235
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:09,198
they don’t want to be alone with any woman.

236
00:21:09,358 --> 00:21:13,018
And they said Mother, “You don’t know these women!

237
00:21:13,178 --> 00:21:16,487
They will make a rape case out of us!” “But how?”

238
00:21:16,647 --> 00:21:26,159
“They do!” So the whole idea is to challenge the innocence of people.

239
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:33,702
For that, I must say, they made this Freud into a god

240
00:21:33,952 --> 00:21:38,854
because of his writings. I don’t know how they accept, also, such writings.

241
00:21:39,014 --> 00:21:41,081
I just can’t understand how they accept.

242
00:21:41,241 --> 00:21:46,811
Because I think they have no idea as to what they are.

243
00:21:47,444 --> 00:21:51,831
Somebody asked me about Freud, “Then what did he say?

244
00:21:51,991 --> 00:21:55,487
Why are people so much against him? Why are you so against?”

245
00:21:55,647 --> 00:22:00,245
I said, “He said that there’s a bad relationship between the mother and the son.”

246
00:22:00,405 --> 00:22:06,073
He just jumped. “He said so? My goodness! Thank God he never came to India,

247
00:22:06,233 --> 00:22:11,503
otherwise we would have cut him into pieces and put them in the Indian Sea!”

248
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:16,733
I said, “But why spoil the purity of Indian Sea also?”

249
00:22:18,709 --> 00:22:21,657
He was so annoyed and angry, he said,

250
00:22:21,817 --> 00:22:23,986
“How could they tolerate such a nonsense?

251
00:22:24,146 --> 00:22:27,440
How could they accept such nonsense against the mother?

252
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,886
They have no purity?” I said, “That’s the trouble with them.”

253
00:22:32,046 --> 00:22:35,076
Now the trouble is that the brain developed too much,

254
00:22:35,236 --> 00:22:39,951
ego developed too much and any such stupid idea

255
00:22:40,403 --> 00:22:45,577
– it’s much worse than stupid – was accepted.

256
00:22:45,737 --> 00:22:49,745
And that is how I find it’s so boring:

257
00:22:49,905 --> 00:22:57,998
every time anywhere you go it’s nothing but this sex business.

258
00:22:58,158 --> 00:23:02,065
It’s too much. I can’t understand how people go on tolerating.

259
00:23:02,225 --> 00:23:08,078
It’s alright, at the most, in some adult films you might show some nonsense,

260
00:23:08,238 --> 00:23:12,042
but every time you see something you find

261
00:23:12,202 --> 00:23:16,706
suddenly this kind of nonsensical scene is coming,

262
00:23:16,866 --> 00:23:20,433
this bedroom scenes, these scenes, and people like it.

263
00:23:20,593 --> 00:23:27,741
They pay for it. They want to have all aspects of it.

264
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:34,019
It is such a natural thing. What is there to talk about it all the time?

265
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:36,183
I don’t understand.

266
00:23:36,343 --> 00:23:40,425
It’s only the development of the brain, of such a manner,

267
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:43,870
that every kind of nonsense it wants to accept.

268
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:46,050
“So what? What’s wrong?”

269
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:49,995
“Well, you’re mad! That’s what. You go to lunatic asylum.”

270
00:23:50,155 --> 00:23:53,800
Lunatics also talk like that. “So what’s wrong?”

271
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:59,229
Same way. Because of such acceptance, they don’t know how much

272
00:23:59,389 --> 00:24:04,315
people have ruined their family life, their children’s life.

273
00:24:04,475 --> 00:24:10,620
In every way, we find that the whole society is full of this nonsense

274
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:15,581
and specially in the television – Italy specially.

275
00:24:15,741 --> 00:24:21,179
I mean, certain buttons you should not press,

276
00:24:22,334 --> 00:24:23,839
you should be very careful,

277
00:24:23,999 --> 00:24:26,775
otherwise you don’t know what you face and you go for vomiting.

278
00:24:26,935 --> 00:24:31,085
You see, as Indians – first reaction is to vomit.

279
00:24:32,561 --> 00:24:41,128
But for people who have not yet realized the value of this innocence

280
00:24:41,288 --> 00:24:47,515
can be easily taken up by this kind of nonsense that’s going on.

281
00:24:50,046 --> 00:24:54,308
Whatever it is, through the blessings of Shri Ganesha,

282
00:24:54,468 --> 00:25:01,702
you are all transformed. You are on a different line.

283
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:07,854
Yesterday these two musicians were surprised how you were praising Ganesha.

284
00:25:08,014 --> 00:25:11,940
They couldn’t believe it, how you could praise Shri Ganesh,

285
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:16,464
because you haven’t even heard the name of Shri Ganesha before

286
00:25:16,624 --> 00:25:21,362
I said, “They see what Shri Ganesha has done to them,

287
00:25:21,522 --> 00:25:26,518
how He has made their attention so beautiful

288
00:25:26,678 --> 00:25:30,854
that they enjoy all the beautiful things of the world,

289
00:25:31,014 --> 00:25:34,350
all the innocent things of the world.”

290
00:25:34,686 --> 00:25:39,409
And there are many people like them, I can tell you, who are struggling.

291
00:25:39,569 --> 00:25:42,769
Not that all the society has accepted this nonsense.

292
00:25:42,929 --> 00:25:44,495
There are many who are struggling

293
00:25:44,655 --> 00:25:49,972
because I know in England they published a book about what children have to say

294
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:54,021
about the politicians: very sweet, sweet things, very sweet.

295
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:57,728
And those books [that] were published were five thousand books because

296
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:01,175
if you publish five thousand, you get it cheaper or something like that.

297
00:26:01,335 --> 00:26:05,913
And in one day all the books were sold out – in one day.

298
00:26:07,647 --> 00:26:11,808
That shows that there are so many people still

299
00:26:11,968 --> 00:26:17,503
who are respecting their innocence and they want to be innocent

300
00:26:17,663 --> 00:26:19,262
and they want to enjoy it.

301
00:26:19,422 --> 00:26:22,761
But a society has to be created of that kind.

302
00:26:22,921 --> 00:26:28,151
For that, you must have a kind of a personality.

303
00:26:28,311 --> 00:26:35,522
You know that I was in London and once I went to Greece.

304
00:26:35,944 --> 00:26:38,739
And the ministers’ wives also came to meet me.

305
00:26:38,899 --> 00:26:41,806
I was surprised. Normally they don’t do. So they said,

306
00:26:41,966 --> 00:26:46,894
“You see, our husbands told us if you want to see serenity personified,

307
00:26:47,054 --> 00:26:50,835
then you must see Mrs. Shrivastava.”

308
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:55,620
I was surprised [that] in Greece they are talking of serenity!

309
00:26:55,780 --> 00:27:00,339
In these modern times anybody talking about purity!

310
00:27:00,499 --> 00:27:04,214
I just couldn’t understand, but I felt at the back of their mind

311
00:27:04,374 --> 00:27:10,933
their tradition, whatever it is, these men could see

312
00:27:11,093 --> 00:27:14,753
that simple thing in me and they went and told them.

313
00:27:14,913 --> 00:27:17,125
And they all enjoyed my company very much.

314
00:27:17,285 --> 00:27:20,370
I was making them laugh and telling them things and all that.

315
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:22,886
And one of them then turned around and said,

316
00:27:23,046 --> 00:27:26,487
“Mrs. Shrivastava, you are just like a child!” “I said, “Really?”

317
00:27:26,647 --> 00:27:28,729
“No, we enjoyed your company so much!”

318
00:27:28,889 --> 00:27:31,558
And when I was coming, they were in tears.

319
00:27:31,718 --> 00:27:36,847
So what I am saying that: whatever innocent personality you have,

320
00:27:37,007 --> 00:27:40,683
you have to project now, to project towards others.

321
00:27:40,843 --> 00:27:44,581
Say somebody is trying to be funny with you

322
00:27:44,741 --> 00:27:47,573
just with one glance you can put that person right,

323
00:27:47,733 --> 00:27:53,073
that you don’t like it. Just to say you don’t like it.

324
00:27:53,233 --> 00:27:56,374
In a way that’s a projection.

325
00:27:57,249 --> 00:28:01,261
Around your society, around where you are working,

326
00:28:01,421 --> 00:28:06,565
you will also find people who have no sense of innocence.

327
00:28:06,725 --> 00:28:09,894
And it’s disgusting to be with them.

328
00:28:10,054 --> 00:28:15,729
But as you have powers, you must use [them] – is to project.

329
00:28:15,889 --> 00:28:19,573
I see with Sahaja Yogis, they don’t even cure people.

330
00:28:19,733 --> 00:28:23,729
They’ll tell me, “Mother, he is to be cured. That is to be done.”

331
00:28:23,889 --> 00:28:26,995
But you are so many, why do you need me to do that now?

332
00:28:27,155 --> 00:28:30,940
You all can cure a patient. You can help the patient.

333
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:35,456
Why can’t you do it? What is the need for me to do it?

334
00:28:35,616 --> 00:28:39,222
You have those qualities within you

335
00:28:39,382 --> 00:28:42,698
because potentially you had them before

336
00:28:42,858 --> 00:28:47,097
and now they are enlightened through the grace of Shri Ganesha.

337
00:28:47,257 --> 00:28:51,226
Now, what you have to do is to assert them.

338
00:28:52,804 --> 00:28:58,620
In that, of course, you must remember not to use your ego,

339
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:02,870
not to use your mind. So somebody would say that,

340
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:07,690
“Mother, without mind how can you impress others?

341
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:11,425
How can you have a rapport with others?” It’s very simple.

342
00:29:11,585 --> 00:29:15,261
Just go thoughtless. Once you are thoughtless,

343
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:21,245
you are in the Realm of the Divine, and then the Divine takes charge.

344
00:29:21,405 --> 00:29:25,026
And it will start emitting such beautiful vibrations

345
00:29:25,186 --> 00:29:30,222
that you will be amazed at yourself how things are working out.

346
00:29:30,382 --> 00:29:33,851
It is not a coincidence we should say.

347
00:29:34,725 --> 00:29:39,776
Like once I was going somewhere and they told me that,

348
00:29:39,936 --> 00:29:43,362
“You have to be very careful!” I said, “Why?”

349
00:29:43,522 --> 00:29:47,065
“Because in the night, you see, these Naxalites (Indian communists) are here

350
00:29:47,225 --> 00:29:50,329
and they might just kill you.” I said, “It’s alright!”

351
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:54,069
He said, “No, it’s very late. You be careful!”

352
00:29:55,155 --> 00:29:58,221
So, the gentleman with me was very much worried.

353
00:29:58,381 --> 00:30:00,683
He said, “You take out your ornaments, everything.”

354
00:30:00,843 --> 00:30:03,984
He put them under the seat and did all that.

355
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:10,979
So, as soon as we reached that place where many Naxalites were standing

356
00:30:11,139 --> 00:30:14,912
with their lanterns and with their sticks,

357
00:30:16,389 --> 00:30:20,370
so I told the driver that, “For one minute you stop the car.”

358
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:23,094
He said, “No, I will not!” “No, you stop!”

359
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:27,964
I looked at them and I don’t know what happened – they just moved on.

360
00:30:28,124 --> 00:30:30,979
I said, “Now speed up the car.”

361
00:30:31,139 --> 00:30:33,425
You see, it is the power that you have.

362
00:30:33,585 --> 00:30:38,405
Unless and until you use this power of love and compassion,

363
00:30:38,702 --> 00:30:45,975
you will not know what you have got. And that comes from your Shri Ganesh.

364
00:30:46,241 --> 00:30:49,913
You see, how children understand love.

365
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:55,826
If you are nice to them, how they react. Maybe sometimes they do not,

366
00:30:55,986 --> 00:31:01,764
but ninety-nine percent [of] children, I have seen, they really react to love.

367
00:31:02,241 --> 00:31:07,003
In our school in Dharamsala there were two children

368
00:31:07,163 --> 00:31:11,714
and they were very troublesome to begin with

369
00:31:11,874 --> 00:31:14,661
and the parents were worried about them.

370
00:31:14,821 --> 00:31:17,163
They sent them to Dharamsala

371
00:31:18,124 --> 00:31:22,198
and otherwise they were very demanding as the modern children are.

372
00:31:22,358 --> 00:31:25,870
“You buy this. You buy that. Go here. We want MacDonald!”

373
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:30,581
This, that was going on. When they went to the school for one year,

374
00:31:30,741 --> 00:31:33,558
they came back and the parents asked them,

375
00:31:33,718 --> 00:31:36,496
“Now, what do you want?” They said, “We don’t want anything!”

376
00:31:36,656 --> 00:31:39,646
“You don’t want anything? You want to go to MacDonald’s?”

377
00:31:39,806 --> 00:31:42,667
They were American. “No, no, we don’t want to go to MacDonald.

378
00:31:42,827 --> 00:31:48,710
We want to sit here and watch Mother’s videos.”

379
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:52,708
They said, “Suddenly, what has happened to them? They were so troublesome.

380
00:31:52,868 --> 00:31:57,573
Why are they now so much changed? What’s the matter with them?”

381
00:31:57,733 --> 00:32:01,104
So then they said, “What about food? Whatever you cook, we’ll eat.

382
00:32:01,264 --> 00:32:02,472
We are not bothered.”

383
00:32:02,632 --> 00:32:05,511
And they were amazed how these children had changed!

384
00:32:05,671 --> 00:32:07,933
But then they said, “We must go out somewhere.

385
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:10,644
We must see the river, we must see the mountain.”

386
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:14,683
“Alright, that we’ll do.” Then again they came home

387
00:32:14,843 --> 00:32:18,808
– no demands, nothing. They didn’t want to go for any shopping

388
00:32:18,968 --> 00:32:22,801
or asking for any shirts or blouse or nothing.

389
00:32:22,961 --> 00:32:28,109
Very much satisfied, dignified.

390
00:32:29,046 --> 00:32:33,496
So they said, “What’s the matter with you? You don’t want anything?”

391
00:32:33,656 --> 00:32:36,417
“No we want something but we don’t know how to tell you.”

392
00:32:36,577 --> 00:32:39,319
“What is it?” “Because you don’t have that.

393
00:32:39,479 --> 00:32:42,102
You can’t get it in the market.” “Well, what is it?”

394
00:32:42,262 --> 00:32:46,831
They said, “Can you get us a pendant of Shri Mataji?”

395
00:32:46,991 --> 00:32:50,468
So sweetly, you know, they said. That’s all.

396
00:32:50,976 --> 00:32:53,378
But they said, “You don’t have?” “No, we don’t have any.”

397
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:57,160
“So you just get us the pendant of Shri Mataji, that’s all.”

398
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:05,130
I mean so deep expression. You don’t want anything else.

399
00:33:05,913 --> 00:33:08,839
I mean, I know the children, I have met them,

400
00:33:08,999 --> 00:33:11,199
but I have not been with them for a long time,

401
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:13,709
I have never been so close to them, nothing,

402
00:33:13,869 --> 00:33:18,187
but look at the love that they have.

403
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:21,699
And they were telling me in the school in the beginning

404
00:33:21,859 --> 00:33:24,777
that anybody goes to trouble us, we said,

405
00:33:24,937 --> 00:33:26,988
“Now we are going to inform Shri Mataji!”

406
00:33:27,148 --> 00:33:30,230
“No, no, no, don’t inform Her.” “Why?”

407
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:34,800
“Because She will not love me any more!” Can you imagine?

408
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:41,574
The value of my love is so much understood by these little, little children

409
00:33:41,734 --> 00:33:47,871
and so much they admire, they want it.

410
00:33:48,031 --> 00:33:53,956
It has no material gain by that, nothing.

411
00:33:54,116 --> 00:33:58,934
All this really shows that Christ as He has said it, that,

412
00:33:59,094 --> 00:34:03,061
“You have to be like small children to enter into the Kingdom of God.”

413
00:34:03,221 --> 00:34:06,550
Without that, you cannot enjoy anything.

414
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:10,714
Like yesterday’s programme was really, I must say

415
00:34:10,874 --> 00:34:12,563
– these Swiss have worked very hard.

416
00:34:12,723 --> 00:34:15,535
They are very hard working I know, but not to this extent

417
00:34:15,695 --> 00:34:21,406
that they started singing Indian music so well in such a combination

418
00:34:22,812 --> 00:34:25,792
and we enjoyed all that very much.

419
00:34:25,952 --> 00:34:32,468
Now imagine these Swiss who are overactive, always working,

420
00:34:33,967 --> 00:34:39,433
they have no time to think about creating something innocent,

421
00:34:39,593 --> 00:34:44,445
creating something sweet of this kind.

422
00:34:44,656 --> 00:34:49,550
And the way they did it shows, really, that they love Shri Ganesha

423
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:56,722
and they understand the value of Shri Ganesha’s manifestation in them.

424
00:34:56,882 --> 00:35:01,660
I was really surprised how they could learn all this Indian music

425
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:05,245
and so many sitting together and singing that song.

426
00:35:05,405 --> 00:35:08,449
And there were some Indians, I said, “Can you sing like this?”

427
00:35:08,609 --> 00:35:11,167
They said, “No.” I said, “Look at these Swiss.”

428
00:35:11,327 --> 00:35:15,456
This is the power of Shri Ganesha’s love.

429
00:35:15,616 --> 00:35:20,480
Because they were to celebrate Shri Ganesha’s birthday,

430
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:25,035
so they got equipped from within.

431
00:35:25,195 --> 00:35:29,761
But if they had not projected it there would have been nothing.

432
00:35:29,921 --> 00:35:33,644
So whatever He is giving you, whatever He is creating in you,

433
00:35:33,804 --> 00:35:41,128
this beautiful innocence, this beautiful fragrance of your living,

434
00:35:41,288 --> 00:35:44,058
every moment, when you are enjoying it,

435
00:35:44,218 --> 00:35:47,308
also know that we have to give it to others.

436
00:35:47,468 --> 00:35:51,831
We have to pour this into others.

437
00:35:51,991 --> 00:35:55,316
And it will work out, I know it will work out.

438
00:35:55,476 --> 00:35:59,269
It is so tremendous. His powers are so tremendous.

439
00:35:59,429 --> 00:36:04,597
Yesterday you saw that in the children’s program

440
00:36:04,757 --> 00:36:09,542
that nobody could beat him, even Shiva, anyone.

441
00:36:09,702 --> 00:36:13,808
And Shiva had to cut His head

442
00:36:13,968 --> 00:36:18,456
because He didn’t know how to overpower Him otherwise.

443
00:36:18,616 --> 00:36:24,478
This is what we have to understand, that if you are innocent,

444
00:36:24,638 --> 00:36:28,660
nobody can cheat us, nobody can trouble us,

445
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:33,269
because in innocence you become a person

446
00:36:33,429 --> 00:36:36,839
who doesn’t care for what is happening to you.

447
00:36:36,999 --> 00:36:41,137
You become a person who tolerates everything thinking these are…

448
00:36:41,297 --> 00:36:46,906
you don’t even think, you feel they are something, stupid people, that’s all.

449
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:53,519
It is a story about a king in China, as I am going to China.

450
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:55,089
There was a king in China.

451
00:36:55,249 --> 00:36:58,910
They are very wise people, I must say Chinese are extremely wise.

452
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:09,410
And he decided to win a cocks’ fight. It’s a cocks’ fight.

453
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:13,843
Imagine the king thinking like that! But it’s all child’s play.

454
00:37:14,429 --> 00:37:17,800
So he went to one great saint and told him that,

455
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:22,933
“How will you train a cock to fight the other cocks?”

456
00:37:23,093 --> 00:37:25,035
He said, “Leave the cock with me.”

457
00:37:25,195 --> 00:37:31,074
So he left the cock there and he trained him very well

458
00:37:31,234 --> 00:37:35,826
because when the king arrived after one month before the fight,

459
00:37:35,986 --> 00:37:38,662
he said, “See now, take this cock it’s your one.”

460
00:37:38,822 --> 00:37:42,662
He said, “This one? This one is not doing anything, just standing straight.

461
00:37:42,822 --> 00:37:46,396
He said, “Yes, yes. That’s it. You take it.”

462
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:54,501
So he took that cock and put him in that contest.

463
00:37:54,837 --> 00:37:57,939
So all the cocks were together.

464
00:37:58,486 --> 00:38:02,685
They started troubling this cock, which was just standing like this as if,

465
00:38:02,845 --> 00:38:06,068
“Some stupid people are trying to trouble me.”

466
00:38:06,228 --> 00:38:09,298
He wouldn’t touch them, he wouldn’t react, nothing of the kind,

467
00:38:09,458 --> 00:38:11,560
he was just standing straight.

468
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:16,224
So all the cocks were surprised that, “This one is not protesting.

469
00:38:16,384 --> 00:38:21,545
He’s just bearing up everything and he’s not bothered as to what we are doing.”

470
00:38:21,705 --> 00:38:25,873
One by one all the cocks disappeared from the field

471
00:38:26,033 --> 00:38:29,552
where they were having these fights.

472
00:38:29,712 --> 00:38:34,025
And this was the only cock which stood up.

473
00:38:34,197 --> 00:38:39,888
So the king was surprised. He took him to the saint and he said,

474
00:38:40,048 --> 00:38:44,560
“This one has become a saint now. So it’s better you keep it with you!”

475
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,926
He’s such a saint that they were all trying to trouble him and he was least bothered.

476
00:38:49,087 --> 00:38:52,311
He was looking like this, left side, right side, both sides.

477
00:38:52,471 --> 00:38:56,771
He thought, “What’s going on with these people? Why are they behaving like this?”

478
00:38:56,931 --> 00:39:01,513
So this is what I have to tell you that your personality itself

479
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:07,275
is made like that and now you worship Him so much [that] He’s within you.

480
00:39:07,435 --> 00:39:16,869
And any kind of problems that you have will be really solved very easily

481
00:39:17,029 --> 00:39:20,092
if you take to your innocence.

482
00:39:20,521 --> 00:39:25,416
And that will create coincidences, as they call it.

483
00:39:25,576 --> 00:39:30,959
But I would say it’s not coincidence, it’s the vibrations.

484
00:39:31,404 --> 00:39:34,923
And you’ll be amazed how things are solved.

485
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:37,322
They’ll say, “Mother, this had happened, that had happened.”

486
00:39:37,482 --> 00:39:40,181
Now see, the other day, it rained so much.

487
00:39:40,341 --> 00:39:42,455
It rained so much so that they said,

488
00:39:42,615 --> 00:39:47,509
“It has become knee-deep mud here and Mother what are we to do?”

489
00:39:47,669 --> 00:39:49,906
I said, “It’s alright. Leave it to Him.”

490
00:39:50,066 --> 00:39:55,540
Next day it was very hot. Imagine underneath these things,

491
00:39:55,700 --> 00:40:01,740
the whole thing got dried out and today you are here for the puja.

492
00:40:02,271 --> 00:40:09,267
It’s an impossible thing that there could be such a change in the weather

493
00:40:09,427 --> 00:40:14,560
that one day it rains so heavily and second day

494
00:40:14,802 --> 00:40:18,572
the whole thing gets absolutely dried out.

495
00:40:18,732 --> 00:40:24,095
It’s His work, because He’s so much powerful.

496
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:30,178
You have come to worship Him, so first of all cleansing has to be done

497
00:40:30,338 --> 00:40:35,422
and He did the cleansing by putting the rain here.

498
00:40:35,582 --> 00:40:40,470
It’s so heavy rains and some of the part of the rains

499
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:54,225
which came near this Palazzo Dorio they turned into ice (hail).

500
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:56,719
I don’t know what is English word is [for] that.

501
00:40:56,879 --> 00:41:01,876
So they all started and the whole thing went round the house.

502
00:41:02,036 --> 00:41:08,619
They were all forming into little, little ice-balls, falling nearby.

503
00:41:09,684 --> 00:41:14,890
Now it is something unbelievable that all over it has just rained

504
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:18,632
only near our house it is the ice-balls are coming.

505
00:41:18,792 --> 00:41:22,429
We can call it ‘miracles’, we can call it anything,

506
00:41:22,589 --> 00:41:27,421
but it is Shri Ganesha’s, we should say, sensitivity

507
00:41:27,581 --> 00:41:31,905
that He thought that, “Now this rain is going near my Mother’s house,

508
00:41:32,065 --> 00:41:37,179
so let us make some sort of a beautiful ice-balls.”

509
00:41:37,339 --> 00:41:40,468
And I went out and I saw, and I was amazed

510
00:41:40,628 --> 00:41:45,077
how it was all around my house [that] there were ice-balls.

511
00:41:45,237 --> 00:41:52,784
What He can do, what he’s capable is absolutely unbelievable.

512
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,536
How He guides you and how He helps you.

513
00:41:56,696 --> 00:41:58,941
How He takes you to [the] right path.

514
00:41:59,101 --> 00:42:01,550
Not only that [but] how He protects you.

515
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:06,925
All the time He is with you because you have become His ganas now.

516
00:42:07,085 --> 00:42:11,519
You are His ganas, so He protects you, looks after you,

517
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:16,644
gives you all the guidance. He takes you to the right path.

518
00:42:16,804 --> 00:42:21,011
He takes you to the righteous road.

519
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:25,206
He gives you all that is dharmic to enjoy.

520
00:42:25,366 --> 00:42:27,917
You always meet friends here and there.

521
00:42:28,077 --> 00:42:30,331
You think it’s a coincidence – it is not.

522
00:42:30,491 --> 00:42:32,933
And that is how He works.

523
00:42:33,093 --> 00:42:42,667
He works with all His beautiful, sweet, loving attention on you

524
00:42:42,827 --> 00:42:45,308
because you are His ganas.

525
00:42:45,468 --> 00:42:48,351
But the ganas have to work!

526
00:42:49,694 --> 00:42:55,092
As I say that, in our body there are ganas

527
00:42:55,279 --> 00:43:03,737
and they fight the disease, they fight the problems that are in the body

528
00:43:03,897 --> 00:43:09,847
those antibodies which are the ganas of Shri Ganesha.

529
00:43:10,007 --> 00:43:12,917
In the same way, you are also His ganas.

530
00:43:13,077 --> 00:43:16,378
He does all this for you. He protects you, He loves you,

531
00:43:16,538 --> 00:43:19,452
He gives you all the good time.

532
00:43:20,397 --> 00:43:22,816
Then what are we doing about it?

533
00:43:22,976 --> 00:43:28,144
It should not be one-sided. When He does all this for you

534
00:43:28,304 --> 00:43:31,906
then what should we do about Shri Ganesh?

535
00:43:32,468 --> 00:43:36,331
What can we do as antibodies?

536
00:43:36,491 --> 00:43:48,243
You don’t have to fight the enemies with any sword or any kind of a weapon.

537
00:43:48,845 --> 00:43:55,266
The enemies you can conquer by simple, two, methods.

538
00:43:55,453 --> 00:44:01,888
One is try your love, your pure love on them. Try that.

539
00:44:02,048 --> 00:44:04,474
You may melt away many people.

540
00:44:04,634 --> 00:44:11,646
Or else, if that is not working, then what should you do

541
00:44:11,806 --> 00:44:16,458
is to sit down and meditate and give bandhans.

542
00:44:16,618 --> 00:44:20,214
There are ways of giving bandhans. The bandhan works so fast

543
00:44:20,375 --> 00:44:25,073
and so beautifully that you are amazed how it has worked!

544
00:44:25,234 --> 00:44:27,932
Because you are so powerful.

545
00:44:28,093 --> 00:44:31,184
The way you give bandhan, [if] anybody else can give

546
00:44:31,345 --> 00:44:36,622
it is not going to work! It’s only you, the Sahaj Yogis, can give bandhan.

547
00:44:36,782 --> 00:44:40,052
There are different types of bandhans you have to give.

548
00:44:40,212 --> 00:44:44,216
And all that works out so well.

549
00:44:44,376 --> 00:44:47,896
So we have to have now faith in our own powers

550
00:44:48,056 --> 00:44:53,912
and we have to know that we are now empowered by Shri Ganesha

551
00:44:54,072 --> 00:44:57,095
to do the work of Sahaja Yoga.

552
00:44:57,352 --> 00:45:02,240
To do the work of Sahaja Yoga is not to feel that you are doing it,

553
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,400
but it is Shri Ganesh who is doing it.

554
00:45:06,751 --> 00:45:10,201
You will be surprised – giving Realisations to people

555
00:45:10,361 --> 00:45:14,025
is the greatest joy Sahaja Yogis can have.

556
00:45:14,767 --> 00:45:18,654
And then you don’t have to think that you have done it

557
00:45:18,814 --> 00:45:22,193
– then is the best – but if you think you have done it then,

558
00:45:22,353 --> 00:45:24,990
“I am very tired,” or “I have done this!”

559
00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:29,865
Many people come and tell me, “Mother, we have done this, we have done that!”

560
00:45:30,025 --> 00:45:35,229
That means they are just feeling the strain of doing any work.

561
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:39,537
But you are not to feel any strain.

562
00:45:39,697 --> 00:45:43,943
His powers are within you, you can see it. Believe me!

563
00:45:44,103 --> 00:45:46,873
Believe in yourself. Have confidence in yourself

564
00:45:47,033 --> 00:45:49,318
– confidence and faith in yourself.

565
00:45:49,478 --> 00:45:54,435
And [know] that you are a storehouse of innocence

566
00:45:54,595 --> 00:45:58,329
which is nothing but compassion and love.

567
00:45:59,532 --> 00:46:01,412
If you have that faith

568
00:46:01,572 --> 00:46:06,908
you will definitely develop a beautiful way of talking to others,

569
00:46:08,446 --> 00:46:16,486
of having [a] relationship with others.

570
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:25,634
It is something that is really a gift of Shri Ganesh.

571
00:46:26,704 --> 00:46:30,165
I don’t think I every shouted at anyone.

572
00:46:31,337 --> 00:46:35,029
Even on my children, I have never shouted, never.

573
00:46:35,189 --> 00:46:38,412
I have never got into a fury or a temper

574
00:46:38,572 --> 00:46:40,755
because I think I can manage without it.

575
00:46:40,915 --> 00:46:44,779
Of course, I had to correct, I had to tell people.

576
00:46:44,939 --> 00:46:49,857
But one thing I have seen [is] that everybody has been afraid of one thing

577
00:46:50,017 --> 00:46:54,443
– that somehow I should never drive out somebody from Sahaja Yoga,

578
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:57,365
because Sahaja Yoga is such a joy,

579
00:46:57,525 --> 00:47:00,708
it is such an energy-giving thing,

580
00:47:00,868 --> 00:47:10,368
it is such a light that you feel absolutely confident about yourself.

581
00:47:11,821 --> 00:47:14,396
So to ask you to leave Sahaja Yoga

582
00:47:14,556 --> 00:47:20,646
is the greatest punishment because you can’t leave me now.

583
00:47:20,806 --> 00:47:25,427
It’s difficult. You just can’t leave me! It’s impossible!

584
00:47:25,587 --> 00:47:29,513
And that is what it is that you also develop those qualities

585
00:47:29,673 --> 00:47:31,540
that you can’t leave.

586
00:47:32,197 --> 00:47:37,787
See, a child, if it is lost, I mean, the parents just go off,

587
00:47:37,947 --> 00:47:39,970
they don’t know how the child is lost.

588
00:47:40,130 --> 00:47:46,405
But supposing, some son of theirs is a very bad boy,

589
00:47:46,565 --> 00:47:51,841
is misbehaving, is doing all kinds of wrong things, they don’t mind.

590
00:47:52,001 --> 00:47:54,693
But when they are young, they are innocent

591
00:47:54,853 --> 00:47:59,341
it’s some sort of a tremendous attachment to them

592
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:04,880
and understanding that “They are our children, we have to look after them.”

593
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:09,060
So [it’s] this innocence that attracts you,

594
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:15,700
that keeps you wondering about your children, about other children.

595
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:20,278
And I was very happy the way you gave a present to Guido

596
00:48:20,438 --> 00:48:24,107
because he’s doing a very difficult task, I must say.

597
00:48:24,267 --> 00:48:30,232
And this appreciation shows that to you it’s very valuable

598
00:48:30,392 --> 00:48:33,427
that your children are looked after.

599
00:48:33,587 --> 00:48:36,802
But you are also a child of your Mother.

600
00:48:36,962 --> 00:48:41,318
As a result, you have all these powers within yourself.

601
00:48:41,478 --> 00:48:47,708
But you must know how to smile. You must know how to win over people.

602
00:48:47,868 --> 00:48:51,310
Still there are some Sahaj Yogis and some Sahaj Yoginis

603
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:56,271
who are still rather stiff! I find them little stiff type

604
00:48:56,431 --> 00:48:58,294
and they can’t give up their stiffness.

605
00:48:58,454 --> 00:49:01,810
Maybe they think no end of themselves or whatever it is.

606
00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:03,825
Then they will not enjoy Sahaja Yoga.

607
00:49:03,986 --> 00:49:07,469
Of course, mentally of course they understand Sahaj Yog and all that

608
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:16,032
but they cannot enjoy fully Sahaj Yoga and all its mirth, its joyous moments.

609
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:20,943
Today is to celebrate His birth

610
00:49:21,103 --> 00:49:26,529
and He was the first God that was created on this Earth;

611
00:49:26,689 --> 00:49:32,556
because he’s also auspiciousness, he’s also Holiness.

612
00:49:33,212 --> 00:49:37,990
So the Primordial Mother didn’t want to create this world

613
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:44,619
without first creating the holiness, the auspiciousness, the purity.

614
00:49:45,267 --> 00:49:48,533
And that’s why He was first created.

615
00:49:49,283 --> 00:49:54,396
Created on this Earth with vibrations, just [a] bundle of vibrations:

616
00:49:54,556 --> 00:49:57,947
so that He can look after all the people

617
00:49:58,361 --> 00:50:05,986
who are going to come from ages to ages,

618
00:50:06,408 --> 00:50:10,971
to guide them always on the right path.

619
00:50:11,157 --> 00:50:15,912
So He is supposed to be in charge of our conscience,

620
00:50:16,072 --> 00:50:20,240
the conscience that eats you up sometimes, that says,

621
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,951
“This is not alright. This I should not have done.

622
00:50:23,111 --> 00:50:25,060
That I should have not done.”

623
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:30,552
But one should try to take very great pride in it.

624
00:50:30,712 --> 00:50:33,896
Like there was one gentleman, an Indian

625
00:50:34,056 --> 00:50:37,388
– Indians can be exceptionally innocent sometimes, exceptionally,

626
00:50:37,548 --> 00:50:41,318
you can’t understand them! So I told him,

627
00:50:41,478 --> 00:50:45,177
“Why did you give up your land?”

628
00:50:45,337 --> 00:50:49,388
He said, “Mother, I thought that later on, when my children will grow,

629
00:50:49,548 --> 00:50:53,870
I might become greedy and I may not give this land to my brother,

630
00:50:54,030 --> 00:50:58,053
who deserves it because I’m too clever, I can cheat him.

631
00:50:58,213 --> 00:51:00,130
So I thought it’s better to give up.

632
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:02,701
So I gave up the land to my brother.”

633
00:51:02,861 --> 00:51:07,056
And he so innocently was telling me that,

634
00:51:07,493 --> 00:51:13,263
“I should not become greedy because maybe that my children will grow up

635
00:51:13,423 --> 00:51:16,365
and I will feel that I must give all this to my children,

636
00:51:16,525 --> 00:51:20,763
so I decided to give up the land just now to my own brother.”

637
00:51:20,923 --> 00:51:22,769
But I said, “What about your brother?”

638
00:51:22,930 --> 00:51:26,415
He said, “He deserves, he needs. I don’t need so much land.

639
00:51:26,575 --> 00:51:29,505
I am doing very well in life. That’s why I have given.”

640
00:51:29,665 --> 00:51:33,888
“But legally?” “Legally,” he said, “it was not in his name,

641
00:51:34,048 --> 00:51:37,044
but I thought it’s better that I give it to him now.

642
00:51:37,204 --> 00:51:39,873
Later on I might become a bad man.”

643
00:51:40,033 --> 00:51:43,684
So the innocence works out in such a manner.

644
00:51:43,844 --> 00:51:46,396
And very sweet, sweet stories I have got to tell you.

645
00:51:46,556 --> 00:51:51,114
There’s one Sahaj Yogi who was a little boy, say about sixteen years of old,

646
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:55,623
he came to me and he said, “My mother has some badhas and the father, too.

647
00:51:55,783 --> 00:51:57,201
I don’t know what to do.

648
00:51:57,361 --> 00:52:00,537
Now supposing I leave my father and mother,

649
00:52:00,697 --> 00:52:06,510
then will the badhas also leave me?” I said, “Maybe. May not be. Depends on…”

650
00:52:07,103 --> 00:52:09,974
“Then what is the need for people to leave their parents

651
00:52:10,134 --> 00:52:14,138
when they are eighteen years of age? Why do people leave their parents

652
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:18,443
at the eighteen years of age? Because, you see, it will be a big loss.”

653
00:52:18,603 --> 00:52:24,458
I said, “Why?” “Firstly, if I start smoking who will stop me?”

654
00:52:24,618 --> 00:52:28,154
Such an innocent thing. “If I start smoking,

655
00:52:28,314 --> 00:52:32,521
only my father can slap me on the face, nobody else.

656
00:52:32,681 --> 00:52:35,365
So he can save me from the smoking.”

657
00:52:35,525 --> 00:52:39,888
I was amazed at his innocence, the way he was saying that,

658
00:52:40,048 --> 00:52:42,763
“I want my father to be there to slap me.”

659
00:52:42,923 --> 00:52:46,318
And then he said, “And then my mother, she’s the one

660
00:52:46,478 --> 00:52:50,974
who corrects me every point; so if she goes away, if I am not with her,

661
00:52:51,134 --> 00:52:55,599
who will correct me? Who will tell me don’t do this and don’t do that?”

662
00:52:55,759 --> 00:53:00,216
I never understood that, look at this boy of sixteen years

663
00:53:00,376 --> 00:53:04,473
– he’s an Indian – telling me that his parents’ utility is

664
00:53:04,633 --> 00:53:09,861
that they are the only people who can stop him from doing wrong things!

665
00:53:10,423 --> 00:53:15,404
Because he was a born-realised and he could see that,

666
00:53:15,564 --> 00:53:20,193
“if I try to do something wrong it’s only my parents can tell me.”

667
00:53:20,353 --> 00:53:25,826
So this innocence always seeks [a] virtuous life,

668
00:53:25,986 --> 00:53:31,544
this better life and it doesn’t assert on others.

669
00:53:31,704 --> 00:53:35,365
But it’s, somehow or other, when there is innocence

670
00:53:35,525 --> 00:53:38,513
– just like you people are now Self-realised people –

671
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:43,029
in the light of your Self, you don’t want to do something

672
00:53:43,189 --> 00:53:47,490
that is not innocent, that is not simple.

673
00:53:47,650 --> 00:53:50,474
For example, I have never seen such honest people

674
00:53:50,634 --> 00:53:54,294
as we have in Sahaja Yoga. Absolutely honest, I mean,

675
00:53:54,454 --> 00:53:58,076
they don’t want to take even a single pie (1/192 Rupee) out of things.

676
00:53:58,236 --> 00:54:01,107
Of course, there have been some horrible people, also,

677
00:54:01,267 --> 00:54:04,029
who made lots of money out of Sahaj Yog, doesn’t matter;

678
00:54:04,189 --> 00:54:07,779
but most of you have become so honest.

679
00:54:07,939 --> 00:54:10,638
I mean there’s so much corruption in this world

680
00:54:10,798 --> 00:54:14,650
and to see people who are so honest.

681
00:54:15,055 --> 00:54:18,596
Now the greatest quality, as you know, of Shri Ganesha’s

682
00:54:18,756 --> 00:54:23,474
I was told yesterday, that for them their Mother is the most important.

683
00:54:23,634 --> 00:54:29,431
What Mother says and what Mother does, that’s the most important thing.

684
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:35,255
I mean, it is so much that I really can’t understand

685
00:54:35,415 --> 00:54:39,821
how you people are so much fond of me.

686
00:54:41,414 --> 00:54:51,404
Because I think that, whatever you think about me mentally

687
00:54:51,564 --> 00:54:54,607
is nothing compared to what you have within yourself

688
00:54:54,767 --> 00:54:58,138
and that is Shri Ganesha’s, again, the quality.

689
00:54:58,298 --> 00:55:00,294
Because He’s so attached to me

690
00:55:00,454 --> 00:55:04,201
that he will fight his Father, he will fight everybody.

691
00:55:04,361 --> 00:55:06,123
That’s what you are.

692
00:55:06,283 --> 00:55:08,466
Anything against me, you cannot tolerate,

693
00:55:08,626 --> 00:55:12,482
anything wrong said against me you cannot follow.

694
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:17,333
I have seen people getting furious if somebody said a word against me.

695
00:55:17,493 --> 00:55:24,099
So this quality of love for me is coming from Shri Ganesha within you.

696
00:55:24,259 --> 00:55:27,208
But the another quality, as I said, is that

697
00:55:27,368 --> 00:55:32,130
He makes the ganas work and so you have to work it out.

698
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:37,857
Yesterday’s thing has shown me how this collectivity

699
00:55:38,017 --> 00:55:44,654
of Switzerland has come up so well, so well.

700
00:55:44,814 --> 00:55:52,208
And it was really showing how we can progress. You all have talents.

701
00:55:52,368 --> 00:55:55,683
Not that only Swiss have. You all have talents.

702
00:55:55,843 --> 00:55:59,373
You all have understanding. You are all intelligent.

703
00:55:59,533 --> 00:56:04,787
All of you are special people and you have to work out in collective way

704
00:56:04,947 --> 00:56:09,982
and also individual way to show your quality of Shri Ganesh,

705
00:56:10,142 --> 00:56:12,388
the way He has the rhythm within Him.

706
00:56:12,548 --> 00:56:16,279
He’s very rhythmic and yesterday those two big musicians sitting,

707
00:56:16,439 --> 00:56:22,177
he said, “Mother, they are so rhythmically clapping, they are rhythmic.

708
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:26,224
There’s no, ‘ha, ha, hoo, hoo,’ just clapping and so rhythmic.

709
00:56:26,384 --> 00:56:28,505
Nobody makes a mistake.”

710
00:56:28,665 --> 00:56:32,068
Then they said, “When they sing also, nobody’s out of tune.”

711
00:56:32,228 --> 00:56:36,560
Normally, if ten people are singing, without proper training,

712
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:40,720
then this are in alto, tenor, bass, everything, they go on.

713
00:56:40,881 --> 00:56:44,998
And you don’t know on what swar (note) they have taken, on what note they are singing.

714
00:56:45,158 --> 00:56:50,154
But they were yesterday very amazed that all of you were singing on the same note;

715
00:56:50,314 --> 00:56:54,193
you wouldn’t leave the note and come onto another note.

716
00:56:54,353 --> 00:56:58,779
That shows that the rhythm of Shri Ganesha is working in you

717
00:56:58,939 --> 00:57:06,482
and His understanding of music, which is one of His qualities is:

718
00:57:06,642 --> 00:57:17,970
that He dances on the music of which Nataraja, the Father Shiva has taught Him.

719
00:57:18,736 --> 00:57:23,208
It’s very rhythmic. That part, I think, a little bit, Sahaja Yogis are missing:

720
00:57:23,368 --> 00:57:28,068
that when they dance they need not be, all of them, in [a] very rhythmic pattern.

721
00:57:28,228 --> 00:57:31,779
They’re alright, but still one has to learn [a] little more

722
00:57:31,939 --> 00:57:34,364
rhythmic pattern, would be a good idea.

723
00:57:34,524 --> 00:57:37,833
As the Shri Ganesha, which is such a big stomach that He has,

724
00:57:37,993 --> 00:57:44,740
He dances so well, so lightly He lifts his body and the way He works it out, it’s amazing.

725
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:50,646
How does He do it with such a…and a short person with such thick legs?

726
00:57:50,806 --> 00:57:58,287
He is very light and the lightness comes because of innocence – Mooladhar.

727
00:57:58,447 --> 00:58:03,193
If the Mooladhara is alright, then lightness is there.

728
00:58:03,353 --> 00:58:10,927
You have seen in Maharashtra how these people were playing the Lezim (dance)

729
00:58:11,087 --> 00:58:17,638
with such speed and with such lightness:

730
00:58:17,798 --> 00:58:20,224
they were lifting their legs and hand.

731
00:58:20,384 --> 00:58:25,759
It was really amazing how they were doing it.

732
00:58:26,868 --> 00:58:31,966
And it is only the innocence of these people of the villages

733
00:58:32,126 --> 00:58:36,044
that they don’t understand much of this nonsense.

734
00:58:36,204 --> 00:58:39,958
They don’t know what is going on with all these things.

735
00:58:40,118 --> 00:58:42,833
They earn their living, they are farmers,

736
00:58:42,993 --> 00:58:47,943
and then in the evening they just sleep off in complete innocence.

737
00:58:48,103 --> 00:58:51,896
They do not plan, they do not sit down and find out

738
00:58:52,056 --> 00:59:00,255
how to kill somebody, maybe something how to rob somebody

739
00:59:00,415 --> 00:59:03,537
or another bad things that people think

740
00:59:03,697 --> 00:59:07,141
– the bad action that comes into their minds. There is no time for that.

741
00:59:07,301 --> 00:59:10,387
They work the whole day. In the evening, nicely they sleep.

742
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:16,130
Or else they will have a bhajan mandeley where they will all sing together

743
00:59:16,290 --> 00:59:18,271
in a very beautiful manner.

744
00:59:18,431 --> 00:59:24,318
So it’s a real sahaj style where we don’t have to think

745
00:59:24,478 --> 00:59:27,662
about killing anybody or to murder anybody.

746
00:59:27,822 --> 00:59:33,662
Like all these cults, they have weapons with them! I can’t understand.

747
00:59:33,822 --> 00:59:39,966
Even I was told that in Poland our Pope maharaj sent lots of weapons there.

748
00:59:40,126 --> 00:59:45,318
What is the need for anybody who is spiritual to have weapons around

749
00:59:45,478 --> 00:59:48,052
and think of violence and killing people?

750
00:59:48,212 --> 00:59:50,849
Because there is no innocence at all. You can see that.

751
00:59:51,009 --> 00:59:54,857
If you are innocent your power is your innocence,

752
00:59:55,017 --> 00:59:59,873
you don’t have to have weapons and guns and things.

753
01:00:00,033 --> 01:00:06,365
All these religions, so-called, are using nothing but weapons and guns

754
01:00:06,525 --> 01:00:10,599
and all kinds of killing objects and they are also killed.

755
01:00:10,759 --> 01:00:16,513
It’s a funny thing going on in the name of God, in the name of Shri Ganesh.

756
01:00:16,673 --> 01:00:18,794
There is no need for us to fight.

757
01:00:18,954 --> 01:00:23,349
There is no need for us to think that we’ll kill this man or kill that one.

758
01:00:23,509 --> 01:00:27,130
Only you have to just desire, project your energy

759
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:30,310
and you will see [that] the person will disappear.

760
01:00:30,470 --> 01:00:33,021
He’ll either become a transformed person

761
01:00:33,181 --> 01:00:37,197
or he will not be there to trouble you.

762
01:00:38,032 --> 01:00:43,154
So, one thing I have to again stress is that we must know our qualities

763
01:00:43,314 --> 01:00:45,556
and our powers.

764
01:00:47,025 --> 01:00:51,357
Many people I know could never come on the stage and speak also.

765
01:00:51,517 --> 01:00:56,540
I said, “You get along – finished! Start it.” It worked out.

766
01:00:57,181 --> 01:01:01,435
Anything, you just project. “I can do it! Why can’t I do it?”

767
01:01:01,595 --> 01:01:05,095
To say, “I can’t. I am sorry.”

768
01:01:05,368 --> 01:01:06,883
This ‘sorry’ is so common now.

769
01:01:07,044 --> 01:01:10,246
On the telephone also people will say “sorry”.  I said, “What ‘sorry’?”

770
01:01:10,407 --> 01:01:12,466
All the time, “sorry, sorry, sorry.”

771
01:01:12,626 --> 01:01:15,474
We used to say, “I beg your pardon,” – was sensible.

772
01:01:15,634 --> 01:01:20,865
But the way people are, “Poor me, you know. How can I do it?”

773
01:01:21,025 --> 01:01:26,794
All such people are not yet aware of their powers that they have.

774
01:01:26,954 --> 01:01:29,302
You can do it, everything. You can.

775
01:01:29,462 --> 01:01:33,693
Everything can be managed; after all, you have the power.

776
01:01:33,853 --> 01:01:38,537
In that power you must know that you are not going to do something indiscreet,

777
01:01:38,697 --> 01:01:40,888
you are not going to spoil anybody,

778
01:01:41,048 --> 01:01:45,919
but your power itself will show that this power

779
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:54,474
is really of love, affection, compassion for the transformation of the whole world.

780
01:01:54,634 --> 01:01:57,669
I am thinking of the complete global transformation,

781
01:01:57,829 --> 01:02:03,595
which, I know, is a mad dream, but still I think like that,

782
01:02:03,797 --> 01:02:09,185
because I see you all, then I think you all can do it

783
01:02:09,345 --> 01:02:16,845
and when I see the Shri Ganesha in you, I am sure it will work out.

784
01:02:17,626 --> 01:02:23,302
So, in my lifetime I have seen so many Sahaj Yogis, all over.

785
01:02:23,462 --> 01:02:27,333
How things are worked out: you have heard about in Brazil

786
01:02:27,493 --> 01:02:30,568
and also in Argentina, most unexpected.

787
01:02:30,728 --> 01:02:34,623
The people came to a program from twelve o’clock in the morning

788
01:02:34,783 --> 01:02:38,396
when we were going to have the program at seven o’clock!

789
01:02:38,556 --> 01:02:41,458
I reached there at about eight, as usual, and they said,

790
01:02:41,618 --> 01:02:44,164
“Mother, You won’t believe there was a big drama here!”

791
01:02:44,325 --> 01:02:47,497
I said, “What drama?” “They were sitting here from twelve o’clock,

792
01:02:47,658 --> 01:02:50,748
so all those who had come earlier got inside,

793
01:02:50,908 --> 01:02:54,474
but those who came at the last minute would not be allowed

794
01:02:54,634 --> 01:02:56,677
and they are sitting there and fighting,

795
01:02:56,837 --> 01:03:00,513
‘No, we are going to come inside somehow!’ ”

796
01:03:00,673 --> 01:03:04,817
So then, one of the Sahaja Yogis sensibly went and talked to the manager

797
01:03:04,977 --> 01:03:07,990
and told, “Baba, let them come! There is room.”

798
01:03:08,150 --> 01:03:09,724
So there were four tiers.

799
01:03:09,884 --> 01:03:13,724
One was the ground, then one more, one more, one more.

800
01:03:13,884 --> 01:03:16,083
When I came I saw, “What’s this?”

801
01:03:16,243 --> 01:03:21,188
All over, the whole thing was filled with these people.

802
01:03:21,673 --> 01:03:25,693
I had never seen them before, but they were there,

803
01:03:25,853 --> 01:03:33,681
and so respectful, so much absorbing the vibrations.

804
01:03:34,547 --> 01:03:40,451
And I found it difficult to control my tears out of a real feeling

805
01:03:40,611 --> 01:03:45,884
of such gratitude for Shri Ganesh.

806
01:03:46,688 --> 01:03:49,162
He’s the one who worked it out.

807
01:03:49,322 --> 01:03:50,724
That’s why they say always,

808
01:03:50,884 --> 01:03:54,638
“First worship Shri Ganesh before starting any work,”

809
01:03:54,798 --> 01:03:57,599
because then it gives you that peace,

810
01:03:57,759 --> 01:04:03,310
that tremendous powerful peace which works out so many things

811
01:04:03,470 --> 01:04:06,603
that you never thought it would.

812
01:04:09,618 --> 01:04:14,216
So we have to request Shri Ganesha

813
01:04:14,376 --> 01:04:19,138
that all the problems of our land owning should be solved by Him

814
01:04:19,298 --> 01:04:22,302
and by your Shri Ganesh power.

815
01:04:22,462 --> 01:04:24,677
We are still hoping to get the land

816
01:04:24,837 --> 01:04:28,084
and I want to install this properly for you because every time

817
01:04:28,244 --> 01:04:30,818
I don’t want you to suffer like this.

818
01:04:30,978 --> 01:04:35,099
It’s a pilgrimage, but rather difficult this time you all had,

819
01:04:35,259 --> 01:04:39,200
but you managed it very nicely and you never showed

820
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:45,345
any kind of a reluctance to accept this challenge.

821
01:04:46,212 --> 01:04:49,919
Shri Ganesha was testing you I think also, a little bit.

822
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:53,279
But all that has worked out so well and now

823
01:04:53,439 --> 01:04:57,154
we are here to do the puja of Shri Ganesh.

824
01:04:57,314 --> 01:04:59,393
May God Bless you.
