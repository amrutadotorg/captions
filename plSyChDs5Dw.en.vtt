03:35.477 --> 03:44.084
Today we are celebrating the great event

03:44.283 --> 03:49.354
of the resurrection of Christ.

03:51.729 --> 03:58.150
On the same pattern is your resurrection;

03:58.539 --> 04:08.736
that you have risen to the new life of Divine love.

04:23.063 --> 04:35.791
You were all in the knowledge that
there’s something higher has to happen to you;

04:36.856 --> 04:47.158
that you are to be born again, but nobody knew how it works.

04:48.088 --> 04:58.217
The subtle side of your being was never told to you.

04:59.431 --> 05:03.862
The saints only talked as to how you should behave.

05:03.989 --> 05:14.373
They only said how you should try to keep a very pure life,

05:14.854 --> 05:24.421
sincere life, but they didn't tell you how it will work out.

05:24.965 --> 05:33.333
Of course people knew in India about it,

05:33.532 --> 05:39.555
very few of them, very, very few of them,

05:40.395 --> 05:49.112
but now it's a worldwide knowledge through you people.

05:52.434 --> 06:03.720
Now while your Kundalini rises,
She is your Mother, She is your individual Mother,

06:04.005 --> 06:09.178
and She gives you the second birth.

06:09.919 --> 06:23.889
That's how you get connected to the Divine paradise.

06:25.624 --> 06:31.020
All this, if it is told without realization has no meaning,

06:31.172 --> 06:37.851
but people are given great ideas about it

06:37.970 --> 06:50.423
and also were promised that one day your resurrection will come.

06:51.291 --> 06:54.881
It is the greatest happening for you,

06:57.612 --> 07:01.040
is the greatest event of your life,

07:01.614 --> 07:10.204
and one must consider it’s very fortunate
that you have been able to achieve it.

07:11.235 --> 07:18.545
All this because also because you desired for it.

07:18.609 --> 07:33.624
In many of your lives
you have been desiring for the heavenly paradise.

07:34.637 --> 07:45.605
People have been going round in the
hills and dales seeking; doing all kinds of things.

07:46.223 --> 07:50.233
That's already done by you.

07:50.423 --> 07:57.325
You don't have to give up anything, no need to give up anything.

07:57.753 --> 08:03.503
This wrong idea; I should say an untimely idea.

08:05.030 --> 08:13.974
This is the time when you have to get your
Sahaja resurrection, spontaneous resurrection.

08:15.266 --> 08:22.007
You don't have to do anything about it,

08:22.157 --> 08:28.763
it's just so simple as that; has worked out so well.

08:29.358 --> 08:38.232
I was really very much overjoyed to see that so many people,

08:38.368 --> 08:43.840
specially Muslims, about whom I have been so much worried

08:44.055 --> 08:47.456
that how can you save these people?

08:47.972 --> 08:55.241
They are so much lost in the mess of wrong thinking.

08:58.611 --> 09:06.890
One has to understand that this Koran was written

09:07.291 --> 09:12.437
forty years after the death of Mohammed Sahib.

09:13.350 --> 09:17.714
So maybe that there might be some words which are being,

09:17.792 --> 09:29.786
just being shifted maybe,
and the meaning might be little bit ambiguous.

09:30.945 --> 09:41.811
Also there was another book called Sunna came out about the same time

09:42.594 --> 09:49.557
and was managed by a person who was not such a great

09:49.717 --> 09:55.375
soul I should say, because he was not a realized soul.

09:55.974 --> 10:03.902
I can't understand how can you religiously understand a poet same

10:04.167 --> 10:11.090
and in the poetry whatever is written,
how can you interpret it correctly?

10:11.336 --> 10:17.699
This is the reason why I, I am a poet also;

10:17.850 --> 10:22.673
I could have written a poetry about it but I said no.

10:22.816 --> 10:30.883
Poetry can twist, can be twisted and also people can misuse it.

10:31.359 --> 10:34.078
That’s the problem with the poetry is.

10:34.429 --> 10:37.135
In India we had the same problem.

10:37.772 --> 10:42.047
For example, Kabira wrote such beautiful poetry

10:42.317 --> 10:45.904
and the way they interpreted was so nonsensical

10:45.974 --> 10:52.891
and so much different from the spirit of Kabira's songs.

10:53.137 --> 10:58.838
About everything they can twist the words

10:58.920 --> 11:07.861
according to their own need,
I found out if I wrote poetry about Divinity.

11:09.516 --> 11:12.826
This exactly what has happened.

11:12.945 --> 11:20.652
In all the religions I’ve seen,
when it comes to poetry people can twist it.

11:21.231 --> 11:34.920
Also, like in Bible, it was so much accepted

11:35.099 --> 11:45.830
that Paul is the one who is going to organize
the publication about Christ,

11:47.576 --> 11:52.177
and he didn't want to write also about resurrection;

11:52.372 --> 11:56.752
he didn't want to write about the Immaculate Conception.

11:56.966 --> 12:00.776
All these things were in his mind

12:00.966 --> 12:07.387
and so Thomas had to run away to India
and John refused to write anything.

12:08.932 --> 12:12.136
Because all such people take charge.

12:12.366 --> 12:14.241
They become in charge.

12:14.424 --> 12:21.559
They think they are responsible for it,
while they are not at all capable.

12:21.684 --> 12:25.474
They don't have the right to do it.

12:27.005 --> 12:31.864
As a result of that, Christianity took a very

12:31.953 --> 12:37.983
wrong attitude towards the inner growth of human being.

12:40.062 --> 12:49.117
It’s, you see the result of that - today when you see what's happening

12:49.650 --> 12:52.865
with the Catholic Church, you are amazed.

12:52.980 --> 12:58.521
How can such an organization be a religious organization,

12:58.648 --> 13:03.044
where all kinds of nonsensical things are going on?

13:03.711 --> 13:10.462
I was also born in a Christian family and
I was shocked the way they interpreted

13:11.073 --> 13:16.318
Christ's life and the way talked about it with great authority.

13:17.366 --> 13:19.316
Books and books were written.

13:19.817 --> 13:22.126
They give big, big sermons.

13:22.277 --> 13:26.139
I thought there's no truth in it what they are talking;

13:26.515 --> 13:29.205
even My father felt the same way.

13:30.332 --> 13:36.316
Because all these books came much after,

13:36.729 --> 13:39.597
the authors of these books.

13:40.120 --> 13:46.385
Secondly, those who tried to write it were not authorized to do that.

13:46.578 --> 13:48.858
They were not spiritual people.

13:49.258 --> 13:55.963
They all wanted to have power; they wanted to have power in religion.

13:57.917 --> 14:04.869
The power in religion is inside, and that should be awakened.

14:05.449 --> 14:11.950
I must say thanks to the Sufis of this country and other countries

14:12.056 --> 14:20.476
that people still think that there is something
beyond all these words and talks and books.

14:22.357 --> 14:30.737
This is something, such a blessing that we have
that in every country we had someone

14:30.918 --> 14:34.570
who talked about reality, about the truth;

14:34.705 --> 14:41.948
though they were condemned, they were tortured,
and so many of them were killed.

14:43.036 --> 14:55.342
This is happening even today; I find that
people don't want to listen to reality, to the truth.

14:56.112 --> 14:59.540
But I was so happy yesterday, really overjoyed,

14:59.675 --> 15:07.636
to see that even the people who were Muslims, were Islamic,

15:07.779 --> 15:20.083
have now coming together, understanding that
they have a higher life than these rituals of everyday.

15:20.697 --> 15:29.536
All these ritualistic life that they have led,
the way they have worked so hard,

15:30.300 --> 15:39.787
They these forty days starvation, going for Hajj -

15:40.049 --> 15:45.647
doing all kinds of things - but there was no unity among themselves.

15:45.781 --> 15:49.263
Even among themselves there was no unity,

15:49.324 --> 15:57.017
and some places I was surprised that they were killing each other.

15:59.027 --> 16:01.069
How can that be?

16:01.258 --> 16:08.073
Because these so called practices did not make them collective.

16:08.254 --> 16:10.506
They were not collective.

16:10.586 --> 16:15.412
They were all separate identities, separate sects,

16:15.659 --> 16:22.923
guided by absolutely ignorant people.

16:24.126 --> 16:31.771
So we have to really celebrate the unity of these people,

16:31.827 --> 16:38.445
the collective nature of these people, who were lost to the truth.

16:38.937 --> 16:44.614
They had no idea as to what truth is,

16:44.900 --> 16:52.947
but still a seeker can never find consolation

16:53.034 --> 16:56.129
with whatever exists.

16:56.597 --> 17:03.698
He’s seeking; he’s seeking and seeking till he finds the truth.

17:03.926 --> 17:08.237
But also there are many seekers who lose their way.

17:09.154 --> 17:11.870
In seeking they get lost.

17:11.999 --> 17:18.560
It's very difficult to convince them that you have lost your way.

17:18.822 --> 17:22.782
But they should see from their own lives.

17:22.901 --> 17:30.039
They should see from their own attainment.

17:30.474 --> 17:34.029
What have they achieved?

17:34.511 --> 17:37.819
Have they got any experience?

17:38.835 --> 17:48.033
To be convinced of what you have got, you must try to verify it.

17:48.924 --> 17:56.607
You can verify on people; you can verify on yourself.

17:57.194 --> 18:04.726
Whatever you are, you know on your fingertips as they say.

18:05.199 --> 18:09.077
Now it’s said in the Koran,

18:09.332 --> 18:13.048
that at the time of your Kiyama – means resurrection time –

18:13.110 --> 18:17.599
they’re two things Kiyamat and Kiyama – two things –

18:17.853 --> 18:20.557
also many people don’t understand the difference.

18:20.777 --> 18:24.957
One is when the resurrection time comes,

18:25.041 --> 18:30.179
and the another is when your destruction comes in.

18:30.622 --> 18:36.579
For the resurrection of human being is the Kiyama,

18:36.730 --> 18:41.930
in which it’s said that your hands will speak;

18:42.216 --> 18:48.742
that you should feel the vibrations on your fingertips.

18:48.888 --> 19:01.548
I would say those who are really Muslims,
who are surrendered, and those who have been

19:01.667 --> 19:16.263
selected to be higher people belonging to
the God's realm must have hands that can speak;

19:16.773 --> 19:19.313
otherwise they are not Muslims.

19:19.552 --> 19:21.726
I would not call them Muslims.

19:21.900 --> 19:26.388
They may be human beings, but not Muslims.

19:27.143 --> 19:31.834
So it's compulsory that for every Muslim,

19:31.938 --> 19:37.983
he thinks he’s a Muslim, he should have vibrations in his hands.

19:38.277 --> 19:40.722
He should feel the vibration.

19:40.827 --> 19:55.409
His hands must speak at the time of resurrection,
which is the Kiyama, Kiyama - not Kiyamat.

19:55.748 --> 20:00.758
These two words are confused in the minds of the people.

20:00.878 --> 20:10.461
So those people who can verify about
their achievements themselves

20:10.582 --> 20:14.259
through their vibrations on their hands,

20:14.379 --> 20:20.703
and also about others through their fingertips are the Muslims;

20:20.976 --> 20:27.155
according to Koran, but nobody has told them this.

20:27.611 --> 20:29.036
They don't know.

20:29.264 --> 20:32.466
To them it’s all right if you go to Mecca

20:32.585 --> 20:36.517
and come back from there; you become a Hajji, finished.

20:36.985 --> 20:41.601
There’s another question one should ask which is very important -

20:41.653 --> 20:48.935
that why Mohammed Sahib was so much against stone worshipping,

20:49.007 --> 20:53.838
clearly, why did He ask people to go round

20:53.917 --> 20:57.986
that black square stone?

20:59.141 --> 21:01.421
What was the purpose of that?

21:01.647 --> 21:07.455
Why was that stone so important?

21:08.127 --> 21:16.012
If you ask this question to any so called Muslim
he’ll say that was the order,

21:16.303 --> 21:20.883
but you can ask the question after all why?

21:20.914 --> 21:23.120
That's also just a stone.

21:23.145 --> 21:32.727
So why did, why did Mohammed Sahib ask
that you should go round that stone?

21:34.016 --> 21:39.832
So many statues were there made of stone

21:40.198 --> 21:47.039
and people started worshipping all kinds of statues
as they do in India also.

21:47.446 --> 21:51.323
But this stone was a Swayambhu,

21:51.417 --> 21:57.611
and is mentioned in the Indian scriptures
that there is Macceshwarshiv.

21:58.046 --> 22:04.767
We have Shivas everywhere in India; there are twelve Jyotirlingas.

22:04.964 --> 22:10.684
Now if I tell you, you need not believe Me,
but you can go and verify on your vibrations

22:10.709 --> 22:15.749
if it is a Shiva or not; same with this black stone.

22:16.042 --> 22:21.335
So Mohammed Sahib found out that this is a Macceshwarshiv

22:21.397 --> 22:32.900
and so the people have to go round to achieve Shiva's blessings,
but it became a ritual.

22:33.001 --> 22:41.607
The whole thing became like a ritual
and nobody could go further from that ritual.

22:42.124 --> 22:44.684
Same thing with the Christianity.

22:46.439 --> 22:51.860
Why today is a day they are talking so big
about repentance

22:52.025 --> 22:59.772
and about feeling guilty about what
they have done, but why did they do it?

23:00.318 --> 23:10.824
They are supposed to be in charge of goodness,
of virtues - so why did they do it?

23:11.045 --> 23:17.741
Why did they do wrong things and now asking forgiveness from God?

23:17.894 --> 23:22.470
Because they were not realized souls.

23:23.092 --> 23:25.512
They’re not Sahaja Yogis.

23:25.615 --> 23:30.701
If the Sahaja Yogis try to do something wrong

23:31.117 --> 23:34.793
then they know that they are doing wrong on their fingertips,

23:34.873 --> 23:39.178
or we can ask them to get out of Sahaja Yoga,

23:39.600 --> 23:43.484
but that seems to be the worst punishment for Sahaja Yogis.

23:44.075 --> 23:48.188
If I tell them to get out of Sahaja Yoga, they don't like it.

23:48.858 --> 23:50.356
Why?

23:50.381 --> 23:58.794
Because they feel we are separated from reality.

23:59.104 --> 24:06.335
All the blessings of the reality are lost to them;
they think that way.

24:10.539 --> 24:17.879
The punishment is nothing,
because we just ask you get out of Sahaja Yoga.

24:18.197 --> 24:24.265
To look at it’s nothing, but Sahaja Yoga is complete freedom.

24:24.828 --> 24:28.635
Sahaja Yoga is complete blessing.

24:29.302 --> 24:33.608
Sahaja Yoga is complete peace and joy.

24:34.465 --> 24:40.800
Surprisingly, if you read Koran you’ll be amazed that Mohammed Sahib

24:40.896 --> 24:47.386
wanted to bring peace, but it's not so.

24:49.355 --> 24:53.061
I met one man from Kashmir.

24:53.208 --> 24:56.746
He said that, “Where is the peace?

24:57.833 --> 25:01.202
They are all fighting, fighting; we want peace.”

25:01.527 --> 25:06.532
But surprisingly, he said, “In India we find there’s peace.

25:06.838 --> 25:11.960
But this Kashmir is a mad place
where everybody is all the time challenged

25:12.077 --> 25:16.899
and everything attacked - under the name of Islam itself.”

25:18.806 --> 25:21.184
So I said, it's not Islam.

25:21.306 --> 25:24.209
Islam means surrender.

25:24.296 --> 25:27.847
And he said, “If you surrender they‘ll kill you.

25:28.085 --> 25:31.932
We have no protection.”

25:32.592 --> 25:36.390
It's very surprising, very, very surprising,

25:36.645 --> 25:40.573
how now the Muslims themselves are realizing

25:40.727 --> 25:46.417
that this cannot be Divine life.
This cannot be Divine life,

25:46.806 --> 25:54.417
because in Divine life people are just the same with each other.

25:54.625 --> 25:58.074
You see we had Sufis all over the world.

25:58.427 --> 26:00.183
I have read them.

26:00.208 --> 26:10.235
I have read the Sufis of Turkey and also other places.

26:10.615 --> 26:16.128
Even in India we had Sufis, though
they don't call themselves Sufis so much.

26:16.731 --> 26:24.639
Sufi means, I don't know what ever you may think it,
but according to Indian understanding

26:24.757 --> 26:29.914
Sufi means 'saaf' and 'saaf' means clean, means pure.

26:29.974 --> 26:33.294
Those who are pure people are Sufis.

26:33.556 --> 26:43.943
In the purity they see nothing
but Divine grace, Divine love, Divine peace.

26:44.085 --> 26:48.868
They talked of peace only; they could not talk of war.

26:49.116 --> 26:58.916
Anybody who talks of war cannot be a person who
has got any right to do that.

27:01.225 --> 27:06.319
War is absolutely like madness.

27:06.562 --> 27:09.441
Even animals won't fight like that.

27:09.568 --> 27:15.797
We are even worse than animals when
we think of war and killing each other.

27:17.078 --> 27:23.065
This should not be done and it has to be stopped completely.

27:23.261 --> 27:33.456
Nobody has right to kill anybody unless and until he is attacked.

27:34.951 --> 27:44.206
So what we hear about our resurrection
is this - that we are above so many things.

27:44.512 --> 27:50.363
We have lost all those destructive qualities.

27:50.504 --> 28:00.079
As in Sanskrit they call it we have six enemies –
kama, kroda, mada, mathsarya, loba moha.

28:00.769 --> 28:03.899
Kama means sexual perversion.

28:04.102 --> 28:06.475
Kroda means anger.

28:07.083 --> 28:09.997
Moha means attraction.

28:10.243 --> 28:12.857
Mada means the pride.

28:13.206 --> 28:17.838
Mathsarya means jealously.

28:18.517 --> 28:29.531
All these six things, sixth one is the greed,

28:29.846 --> 28:39.007
all these six things that we had in our mind - out of
our ignorance, out of our upbringing,

28:39.248 --> 28:43.443
out of our reading, whatever it is,

28:43.562 --> 28:49.387
whatever we had developed, we were having - just drops out.

28:50.509 --> 28:57.008
When the Kundalini rises and you become one with the Divine,

28:57.112 --> 29:01.048
then you are on sound grounds.

29:01.407 --> 29:05.363
You realize that you have found the truth

29:05.569 --> 29:11.270
and you no more can enjoy all these destructive habits.

29:11.532 --> 29:13.836
They just drop out.

29:14.234 --> 29:23.144
So you go into a new realm of Divine construction within you.

29:23.557 --> 29:27.836
This is the real resurrection of human beings.

29:28.773 --> 29:36.894
Now, you know that certain subtle things
still remain despite the fact

29:36.997 --> 29:43.870
that people try to destroy the books, to spoil the meaning of things.

29:44.021 --> 29:48.661
Despite that, subtle things remain there.

29:49.218 --> 29:57.753
For example we offer eggs during Easter.

29:58.467 --> 30:02.639
What's the meaning of offering eggs?

30:02.880 --> 30:05.441
Why should we offer an egg?

30:05.769 --> 30:14.314
First of all we offer egg because
the egg can go into a transformation.

30:14.781 --> 30:18.639
It can become a small chick;

30:18.873 --> 30:24.715
it can be born again.
It’s the egg has the capacity to be born again.

30:24.907 --> 30:34.729
So when you get this egg as a symbol of Easter it means -

30:34.793 --> 30:42.244
you can become a different person, a reformed person

30:42.331 --> 30:48.026
and a great spiritual person.
You can become; it means that.

30:48.081 --> 30:50.346
Why do we give eggs?

30:50.399 --> 30:52.409
People don't know.

30:52.560 --> 30:54.580
I asked so many people.

30:54.627 --> 30:59.554
I asked even some priests who think
they are great authorities of Christianity.

30:59.801 --> 31:03.886
They didn't know why they give eggs.

31:04.496 --> 31:16.111
Secondly, if you read the story about
the birth of Shri Ganesh

31:16.275 --> 31:24.042
and then you proceed on, you’ll be surprised is written down
that it was called as Brahmand -

31:24.321 --> 31:32.367
means the egg of the Brahma that came into existence,

31:32.733 --> 31:40.648
and half of it became the Mahavishnu means the Christ,

31:40.751 --> 31:47.171
and half of it remained as Shri Ganesh.

31:47.512 --> 31:57.331
And then it is said that then when Mahavishnu
came out, He started crying for His Father.

31:57.753 --> 32:02.864
Just think of it, He was asking for His Father.

32:03.070 --> 32:09.813
Now if you see Christ, He always uses these two fingers.

32:10.087 --> 32:14.044
No other Incarnation has used these two fingers.

32:14.307 --> 32:22.427
This means you know this is the Vishuddhi and this is the Nabhi.

32:23.337 --> 32:33.461
That means He’s talking of His Father who was Nabhi King.

32:33.486 --> 32:36.974
Who's that? You know that very well is the Vishnu,

32:37.077 --> 32:42.952
and His incarnation as Shri Krishna.

32:43.122 --> 32:49.119
So what He’s indicating is this, that - they are My Father.

32:49.310 --> 32:51.529
How clearly He does that.

32:51.617 --> 32:57.967
Why not have some other mudras,
other style of holding the fingers?

32:58.085 --> 33:02.758
But He hold always these two fingers, meaning -

33:02.838 --> 33:08.804
My Father the one who was Vishnu and who was Shri Krishna.

33:10.423 --> 33:22.786
And then in the lives of Shri Krishna
they say, “Mahavishnu will be Your Son.”

33:22.990 --> 33:28.957
All these things are not put together as
I am telling you; separately,

33:29.039 --> 33:37.431
but if you have proper understanding
you can understand the connection between the two -

33:37.550 --> 33:48.743
that Christ was the son of Shri Vishnu and Shri Krishna

33:49.203 --> 33:58.313
and that was blessed that
“You will be the support of the whole universe.”

33:58.468 --> 34:02.317
The support, the adhar of the whole universe, He said it clearly.

34:02.387 --> 34:12.568
It is said so that “You will be supporting the whole universe.”

34:13.066 --> 34:19.954
Now the one half is Shri Ganesh who, is the support in a way;

34:20.049 --> 34:25.219
it supports the Kundalini, it looks after the Kundalini,

34:25.338 --> 34:32.908
it looks after the chastity of the Mother -

34:33.139 --> 34:42.072
and the another one which is expressed is Jesus Christ,

34:42.548 --> 34:48.056
who is the support of the whole universe.

34:48.610 --> 34:55.591
So naturally it has to be the moral basis

34:55.814 --> 35:02.562
as He is a part and parcel of Shri Ganesha,

35:02.776 --> 35:06.258
it's the moral basis of human beings.

35:06.348 --> 35:12.318
On the moral basis only you will be supported;

35:12.987 --> 35:15.680
not all other nonsense that they have,

35:15.855 --> 35:24.537
but a moral basis, and which is missing
in the lives of Christianity.

35:24.761 --> 35:30.489
Everything is allowed, very surprising.

35:30.823 --> 35:39.237
You can do whatever you like as long as
you don't take a divorce in the Catholic Church.

35:39.713 --> 35:49.221
And also in the other Church which you can call
non-Catholic Churches, there are many,

35:49.542 --> 36:00.423
even if you are married, you can do whatever you like.

36:00.781 --> 36:06.496
Even the Vatican I was told has all these problems.

36:07.243 --> 36:14.133
How can that be if you are the people who think you are baptized?

36:14.608 --> 36:19.518
I mean there's a big celebration of baptism by these priests.

36:19.824 --> 36:24.581
Then where is the Sahasrara and where is the Kundalini

36:24.627 --> 36:27.702
and how do you have your second birth?

36:28.170 --> 36:33.055
There's no second birth, just some priest puts his hand on your head.

36:33.240 --> 36:38.032
Actually it makes a problem for realized souls,

36:38.215 --> 36:42.845
to put hand of the priest who are not realized souls,

36:43.218 --> 36:46.552
and that creates a problem for children.

36:46.577 --> 36:50.503
I have seen many children they start crying loudly

36:50.615 --> 36:54.713
when they are being blessed by these priests,

36:55.522 --> 36:59.480
because they are realized souls and the priests are not.

36:59.587 --> 37:02.007
It's very interesting.

37:02.094 --> 37:06.361
But they say, “After all you see it's the priests that are bad,

37:06.405 --> 37:11.122
but not Christ.” But how are they related to each other?

37:11.359 --> 37:15.834
Christ stood for morality.

37:17.603 --> 37:25.554
And about Him also in these modern times
they are saying all kinds of filthy things.

37:25.795 --> 37:35.439
They cannot understand a character
which is moral; to this extent we have gone.

37:37.237 --> 37:41.128
Morality is out of question.

37:41.740 --> 37:48.364
You do whatever you like; as long as
you go to church and confess, you’re all right.

37:49.126 --> 37:54.865
These are the absurdities of modern religions.

37:55.068 --> 38:03.343
Every religion has problems and the worst  I feel,
when you have

38:03.667 --> 38:07.550
the support of the world as your leader -

38:07.670 --> 38:15.296
how can you allow people to have such a immoral life?

38:17.794 --> 38:27.263
Immorality how can you tolerate when you follow the example of Christ?

38:27.722 --> 38:31.269
Out of question!

38:31.620 --> 38:36.501
He is the embodiment of morality.

38:36.645 --> 38:44.690
He is Shri Ganesh and how can you allow people

38:45.159 --> 38:49.667
to come to churches, to the temples,

38:50.091 --> 38:55.591
and allow them to have immoral life?

38:56.012 --> 39:00.681
What is the atonement for such people?

39:01.728 --> 39:12.836
The basis of Christ's life, the whole being
of Christ is morality; to establish purity.

39:15.386 --> 39:22.185
Now, it was Shri Ganesha who was created first

39:22.375 --> 39:30.474
by the Adishakti, because She wanted purity around.

39:32.307 --> 39:38.876
She wanted human beings to enjoy their purity

39:38.955 --> 39:48.536
and their personality which was emitting light to others.

39:49.067 --> 39:55.407
If there is impurity say for example on a glass

39:55.673 --> 40:02.714
and if you use that glass on top of the light,
how can the light pass out?

40:03.372 --> 40:11.337
The impure life cannot, cannot give light to others,

40:11.392 --> 40:15.292
and cannot show your inner light also.

40:15.356 --> 40:23.672
Both things are absolutely true about impurities.

40:24.286 --> 40:28.523
But people say that we have to accept

40:28.635 --> 40:33.666
because if you have to have more people for your religion

40:33.740 --> 40:40.142
you should accept many things, and one of them is impurity.

40:42.740 --> 40:45.078
And just think of it.

40:45.209 --> 40:49.976
Now at the Agnya where Christ resides,

40:50.246 --> 40:56.087
if your eyes are impure, full of lust and greed,

40:56.858 --> 41:04.949
then you are against Christ; you are an antichrist.

41:06.367 --> 41:13.966
If your eyes are clean and pure,

41:14.290 --> 41:23.592
then only you can enjoy love of God, otherwise you cannot.

41:24.635 --> 41:32.057
And also the love of another Sahaja Yogi or Yogini you can only enjoy

41:32.140 --> 41:36.933
in completeness if your eyes are clean.

41:37.020 --> 41:39.436
Just imagine.

41:40.046 --> 41:49.737
But if you have roving eyes and all sorts of things, I don't know

41:50.095 --> 41:54.724
how can you call yourself Christians? You cannot.

41:55.679 --> 41:59.960
Whatever certificate you may carry, but you are not,

42:00.129 --> 42:07.498
because those who are following Christ
have to have absolutely a moral life.

42:08.022 --> 42:16.028
That's a compulsion of the inner being on you -

42:16.228 --> 42:22.065
that you enjoy your morality

42:22.574 --> 42:29.807
and you enjoy above all your clean eyes.

42:31.150 --> 42:41.783
This is what I have come to know about the Western life
that the eyes are not clean.

42:41.918 --> 42:46.822
They’ll go to the church and their eyes will be moving here and there.

42:46.974 --> 42:49.244
How can that be?

42:49.276 --> 42:51.685
How can you do that?

42:51.710 --> 42:58.691
If you think Christ is the one who was resurrected
and you are to be resurrected,

42:58.767 --> 43:05.075
first of all see that you have pure love in your eyes.

43:05.458 --> 43:13.519
Now pure love is not relative, cannot be contaminated,

43:13.852 --> 43:19.058
cannot have lust and greed in them.

43:20.633 --> 43:26.234
These two things have to drop out from your mind completely.

43:26.814 --> 43:36.290
These are the days of people having greed, lots of greed they have.

43:38.765 --> 43:42.468
I just don't know what sort of things they have because

43:42.556 --> 43:46.814
I haven't studied so much the immorality of human being.

43:47.676 --> 43:52.222
Whatever I see are beautiful people like you.

43:52.601 --> 44:00.382
But when I try to understand the so-called Western culture

44:00.541 --> 44:06.141
I am surprised that even if they want to make a life for someone -

44:06.403 --> 44:11.792
like “The Life of Shakespeare” I saw,
who was according to Me

44:11.991 --> 44:20.157
was Avadhoota; means a person who has gone beyond all human

44:20.448 --> 44:28.415
destructive habits, Avadhoot is a very high quality yogi -

44:28.629 --> 44:35.160
and they show him as a stupid man running after a woman.

44:35.502 --> 44:47.322
They cannot conceive of human beings
who could be morally perfect, who will have moral sense.

44:47.393 --> 44:56.061
They cannot conceive, because those
who do this kind of thing are not realized soul.

44:56.290 --> 44:58.651
They are not Sahaja Yogis.

44:58.754 --> 45:04.451
So the conception about morality doesn't come into their head.

45:04.610 --> 45:07.628
They think as we are like that, the others are.

45:07.681 --> 45:12.312
Actually mostly they do it to justify themselves.

45:12.479 --> 45:23.999
So ugly and so horrifying is the depiction
of the character of such great people

45:24.126 --> 45:32.857
who talk such great things, shows that human beings
are really degraded in their value system.

45:32.990 --> 45:40.978
They cannot conceive of somebody who is an ideal personality.

45:41.337 --> 45:49.917
They think by saying so they are talking of something beyond reality.

45:49.972 --> 45:52.937
They don't know reality.

45:54.444 --> 45:58.365
Yesterday’s Sufi thing, I was very impressed

45:58.390 --> 46:01.709
when they said about the four stages that you have.

46:02.867 --> 46:07.576
And out of that the Haakikat - means the reality,

46:07.878 --> 46:12.433
you have to get into the reality.

46:13.284 --> 46:15.486
Reality is what?

46:15.898 --> 46:18.979
It’s not a perception.

46:19.162 --> 46:24.708
It's not seeing something, but it’s being something.

46:27.249 --> 46:34.300
If you start seeing, you might see something
white, red, yellow but you are not that.

46:34.513 --> 46:43.557
When you are, you are the reality,
then you emit reality,

46:43.874 --> 46:49.742
you see reality, you enjoy reality, you live in reality.

46:49.917 --> 46:55.028
This is real life and you don't indulge into

46:55.092 --> 47:02.373
something which is unreal, imaginary or below dignity.

47:02.398 --> 47:03.944
No you don't do it.

47:04.047 --> 47:09.152
You are the reality, is the Haakikat, as they say.

47:09.228 --> 47:15.685
You are the reality and you are emitting reality

47:15.741 --> 47:23.151
in your behavior, in your talks, in your lives, in everything.

47:25.730 --> 47:35.420
All this brings forth the greatest force of spirituality.

47:38.299 --> 47:46.724
Whatever is falsehood, whatever is wrong, whatever is destructive,

47:47.256 --> 47:53.500
will run away from a man who stands in reality; is automatic.

47:55.818 --> 48:00.719
It is absolutely part and parcel

48:00.925 --> 48:06.231
of the same personality who is supposed to be a realized soul.

48:06.776 --> 48:12.395
So the resurrection has taken place no doubt - all right.

48:12.648 --> 48:15.218
Your hands are speaking - all right.

48:15.377 --> 48:27.122
I don't want to give you any command or
any kind of a fixed road that you have to follow.

48:27.443 --> 48:31.693
Now you are free, because you have the light.

48:31.795 --> 48:34.778
When you have the light why should I tell you which way to go?

48:34.803 --> 48:43.793
You know yourself that you have the light,
so you follow yourself in a way

48:43.888 --> 48:49.241
that is an enlightened path, with your own light.

48:49.368 --> 48:53.398
Don’t somebody has to tell you
hat don't do this, don't do, nothing of the kind.

48:53.581 --> 48:58.847
You want just do it, if something wrong
you will not do; if you are doing it

48:58.881 --> 49:04.916
then know that you have to still rise above all this thing.

49:05.519 --> 49:11.510
You are the Nabhis that are described in the Koran.

49:11.750 --> 49:17.081
You are the ones who are going to resurrect the whole world.

49:17.240 --> 49:24.573
You are the ones who are going to help the downtrodden people

49:24.709 --> 49:30.219
into the filth of immorality. Your life should show.

49:30.346 --> 49:39.430
Look at these few of these people who were Sufis,

49:39.621 --> 49:46.849
who were very clean people, how have they been able to channelize

49:47.206 --> 49:50.407
the other people into a better life?

49:51.202 --> 49:53.617
That is what you are.

49:53.780 --> 49:59.275
You have to channelize their lives; that's your job.

49:59.397 --> 50:07.157
Don't think about what is happening,
how the people are stupid, immoral, forget it.

50:07.412 --> 50:10.222
What you have to know what you are.

50:10.310 --> 50:17.831
You have to be aware of yourself
and of your responsibility as being the purest of pure.

50:18.206 --> 50:22.857
As my name is indicates, you are My children,

50:22.956 --> 50:28.773
and that indicates the children of Nirmal, means purity.

50:29.008 --> 50:34.768
Purity is the basis of your existence.

50:35.624 --> 50:41.757
You should try to see where, what you were, in which part.

50:42.029 --> 50:47.658
There’s no mistake in appreciating the art,

50:47.817 --> 50:54.237
appreciating all that is beautiful, appreciating all

50:55.007 --> 50:59.444
that is created out of beautiful minds,

50:59.547 --> 51:04.345
but there should be no lust and greed in that appreciation.

51:04.640 --> 51:10.155
Pure appreciation, purity is the message,

51:10.209 --> 51:15.737
and once you have the purity within yourself you will love yourself.

51:16.012 --> 51:19.361
As I love you, you will love you also.

51:19.409 --> 51:26.263
And then you will understand this word love
which comes out of the purity.

51:26.550 --> 51:35.698
The blossoming of your purity,
the fragrance of your purity, you enjoy all the time

51:35.839 --> 51:41.841
and the love that you have flows,

51:41.952 --> 51:48.602
flows towards all those who are to be loved,
who have to be looked after.

51:48.919 --> 51:55.208
Don’t worry about the people who are destructive.

51:55.377 --> 52:00.403
That's the only word I can use,
because there are so many things one can say about.

52:00.602 --> 52:05.792
Let them be destructive because they are destroying themselves.

52:05.893 --> 52:08.474
Why should we worry about them?

52:08.545 --> 52:10.987
They think they are destroying others but they are not,

52:11.122 --> 52:15.802
they are destroying themselves.
So forget about it, just forget.

52:15.955 --> 52:25.657
You think yourself to be responsible for the construction
of the whole world,

52:25.724 --> 52:28.444
it's not only a few people.

52:28.762 --> 52:33.485
You are very intelligent, knowledgeable and understanding.

52:33.580 --> 52:38.196
You are not like the Disciples of Christ who were not educated,

52:38.223 --> 52:46.118
who didn't understand so much and
who did get realization but were not of your level.

52:46.772 --> 52:54.943
Whatever they could do reached to a point
where this kind of a mess of a Christianity has come,

52:55.347 --> 52:58.279
but you can't create that kind.

52:58.363 --> 53:08.386
You will create a new vibrant religion which is global.

53:08.607 --> 53:14.899
I was very happy to see that now
we have people from all over the world.

53:15.145 --> 53:17.771
It’s a global movement all over.

53:18.311 --> 53:25.350
It has nothing to do with the limited ideas of so called religions.

53:25.636 --> 53:28.747
They have ruined every religion.

53:28.786 --> 53:37.011
Islam is ruined, Christianity ruined,
and Hinduism ruined, and Buddhism the worst.

53:37.524 --> 53:40.554
In Buddhism you give up everything -

53:40.729 --> 53:48.007
all your belongings, all your property, give to the guru, imagine!

53:48.436 --> 53:55.924
And the guru is so greedy horrible fellow.

53:56.763 --> 54:03.319
How can he give resurrection?
Himself is a greedy fellow,

54:03.534 --> 54:09.397
misleading others just taking away everything.

54:10.424 --> 54:13.985
Then same thing about Christianity

54:14.088 --> 54:17.091
that you all become Nuns,
you become Fathers, you become

54:17.116 --> 54:20.869
Brothers and I don’t know, all nonsense.

54:21.126 --> 54:24.646
But there's no change within.

54:25.947 --> 54:32.056
Somebody came to Me and I said, “Why did you become a priest?”

54:32.145 --> 54:34.855
He said, “Because I was jobless.

54:36.212 --> 54:37.957
I had no job.”

54:37.957 --> 54:38.957
Baba?

54:38.957 --> 54:41.399
“So I took up the job of a priest.”

54:41.478 --> 54:42.938
Can you imagine?

54:43.576 --> 54:50.503
He could not fit into any job, so the minimum of minimum
he took is this job.

54:50.830 --> 54:53.060
Then what did you do?

54:53.234 --> 54:59.704
“They told me what I have to preach and first I had to practice

55:00.122 --> 55:04.614
and remember it by heart, and then I don't know,

55:04.738 --> 55:11.650
I started talking this, talking that.”
I said he must be a big possessed man.

55:11.817 --> 55:17.286
He had no mind of his own; he didn't know what he was talking.

55:17.421 --> 55:24.087
He would take out one sentence from Bible
and go on talking, boring everybody.

55:24.268 --> 55:31.499
And I was surprised that within fifteen minutes
people wanted to get out of the church.

55:31.865 --> 55:39.372
As soon as the sermon was over they would run out
and breathe, “Thank God.”

55:40.126 --> 55:44.109
Is that what religion gives you?

55:44.324 --> 55:46.977
Is that what should happen to you?

55:47.096 --> 55:49.980
No, it's not that.

55:50.124 --> 55:56.287
What happens to you that
you enjoy yourself, you enjoy the collectivity,

55:56.312 --> 55:58.586
you enjoy the goodness, the morality.

55:58.586 --> 56:04.669
The whole thing is like the nectar of life.

56:05.848 --> 56:10.407
So that changes the whole picture.

56:10.954 --> 56:17.707
The ritualism is so much; in the Hindu religion
there is too much of ritualism.

56:17.964 --> 56:25.461
You sit on the right or you sit on the left;
you do this at this time I mean, lots of it.

56:25.625 --> 56:30.459
That when your sister dies how many days you should starve yourself;

56:30.484 --> 56:33.876
if your husband dies then how many days?

56:34.810 --> 56:40.198
Dies is died, finished; the body’s finished now.

56:40.569 --> 56:44.920
So you fast for so many days - is very wrong,

56:44.945 --> 56:48.631
because you’re fasting the bhoot might come in to you.

56:51.637 --> 56:57.380
But still, what I would say all these ritualisms and all that,

56:57.520 --> 57:05.972
are created by human beings
who were claiming to be something great.

57:06.160 --> 57:13.284
They are not; by no means they are the people in charge of morality,

57:13.331 --> 57:18.274
in charge of higher life.

57:18.845 --> 57:24.388
They lead such a mundane useless life.

57:26.473 --> 57:29.667
I went to a temple of Shri Ganesha,

57:29.751 --> 57:35.791
which is supposed to be Swayambhu,
one of the eight temples; it is one of them.

57:39.061 --> 57:40.768
And I was surprised.

57:40.793 --> 57:50.016
The man who was worshipping was supposed to be the priest,
he was suffering from paralysis,

57:50.590 --> 57:58.110
and his brother died of paralysis, now his son was also paralyzed.

57:58.396 --> 58:01.524
He said, “What is this Ganesha doing to us Mother?”

58:01.549 --> 58:05.059
I said, “What are you doing to Ganesha?

58:05.321 --> 58:09.331
How much money you earn out of it?”

58:09.434 --> 58:12.043
He said, “Quite a lot.”

58:12.305 --> 58:14.560
“And then what do you do with this money?

58:14.585 --> 58:17.429
Do you do anything for the society?

58:17.454 --> 58:19.979
Do you try to improve their lives?

58:20.004 --> 58:26.541
Have you any attention on the society
or you are just ooking after yourself?”

58:26.696 --> 58:33.168
As a result, he’s got paralysis,
his brother got paralysis, son got paralysis.

58:33.567 --> 58:37.213
And he was blaming Ganesha for that.

58:37.713 --> 58:42.455
He said, “Is it a real Ganesha?”
“Yes it is, but you are not.

58:42.765 --> 58:45.841
You don't deserve.”
I told him off on his face.

58:45.984 --> 58:49.415
He said, “All right you may say whatever you like but You cure me.”

58:49.534 --> 58:54.802
I said, “First promise that whatever money you get out of this temple

58:54.827 --> 58:59.646
you will spend it for the betterment of people.”

59:00.605 --> 59:03.636
But how can they?

59:05.080 --> 59:07.460
They are not realized souls.

59:07.563 --> 59:12.833
Such a lot of priests I see walking about with all this funny dresses.

59:12.873 --> 59:13.873
What?

59:14.064 --> 59:21.193
These are like dead bodies,
walking around with all kinds bad vibrations.

59:22.019 --> 59:24.214
I can't understand.

59:24.482 --> 59:30.442
And the other people are very simple,
they say, "Oh my goodness, see now he’s a priest."

59:30.641 --> 59:32.514
So they must respect.

59:32.539 --> 59:36.251
But, they don't see it; they do not ascertain

59:36.276 --> 59:43.876
what is the spiritual value of that person
who calls himself as the priest.

59:45.290 --> 59:47.420
That is your job.

59:47.523 --> 59:49.142
You don't have to fight with them.

59:49.167 --> 59:51.016
You don't have to denounce them.

59:51.016 --> 59:54.137
You don't have to describe them.

59:54.137 --> 59:57.977
No need, but understand that you are different.

59:57.977 --> 01:00:01.852
You have the right. You are the authority

01:00:02.066 --> 01:00:05.221
and so with that authority and confidence

01:00:05.246 --> 01:00:08.316
you have to go about and save people.

01:00:08.316 --> 01:00:11.765
You are realized souls.

01:00:11.918 --> 01:00:14.619
You got your resurrection.

01:00:14.651 --> 01:00:20.681
You are yogis; I agree, but what is your job?

01:00:20.967 --> 01:00:23.358
Why, why this has happened?

01:00:23.445 --> 01:00:30.238
Why this light has come in to you is to take the blind

01:00:30.897 --> 01:00:36.178
in your hands and take them towards the light.

01:00:36.416 --> 01:00:40.293
This is what is your resurrection for.

01:00:40.468 --> 01:00:49.803
It's not only for your seeking but also is the grace of the Divine,

01:00:49.917 --> 01:00:54.985
for you to make the whole world Divine, as far as possible.

01:00:55.070 --> 01:00:58.009
How many people have you given realization?

01:00:58.089 --> 01:01:00.123
How many people you have talked to them?

01:01:00.148 --> 01:01:03.550
I tell you I was surprised; once I was traveling by plane

01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:07.194
and there was some lady traveling with Me

01:01:07.219 --> 01:01:12.142
and she started talking to Me about her cult, about her nonsense.

01:01:12.167 --> 01:01:15.799
So look at it, shamelessly she was talking.

01:01:16.076 --> 01:01:21.624
Listening to her I said, Sahaja Yogis won't,
they won't talk about Sahaja Yoga.

01:01:21.851 --> 01:01:27.615
Every person who is a Sahaja Yogi has to talk about Sahaja Yoga,

01:01:27.805 --> 01:01:32.133
may not be with the wrong type but with the right type of people.

01:01:32.645 --> 01:01:37.027
That's a thing you have to do. That's why you are enlightened.

01:01:37.394 --> 01:01:42.180
You are not enlightened to be put somewhere in the forest

01:01:42.688 --> 01:01:45.623
or to be lost to the whole world.

01:01:45.648 --> 01:01:51.497
You are enlightened; you are resurrected to enlighten other people.

01:01:51.607 --> 01:01:54.936
That's what you are there for

01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:58.090
and you can do it. Many have done it.

01:01:58.131 --> 01:02:00.452
So many of you have done it,

01:02:00.507 --> 01:02:07.101
and I would say that all of you, whether
you are a man or a woman, you have to do it.

01:02:08.784 --> 01:02:19.247
And that's the request of your Mother - t
hat make use of your realization.

01:02:19.885 --> 01:02:26.350
And the attention should be only on realization.

01:02:26.735 --> 01:02:31.888
How many people you are going to give realization to?

01:02:32.125 --> 01:02:36.012
How many people you are going to save?

01:02:36.893 --> 01:02:39.957
Is a very simple job for you.

01:02:40.014 --> 01:02:41.995
You have to just raise the Kundalini.

01:02:42.093 --> 01:02:43.143
You can.

01:02:43.286 --> 01:02:47.802
You should see how just with your hand
you can raise the Kundalini of others

01:02:47.827 --> 01:02:50.507
and give them their resurrection.

01:02:50.909 --> 01:02:53.155
You don't have to do anything.

01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:56.424
The life is not that difficult for you.

01:02:56.463 --> 01:03:00.622
Your job is the easiest thing; it’s just to raise your hand.

01:03:00.647 --> 01:03:03.098
In hand, in your hand you have the power,

01:03:03.173 --> 01:03:11.976
just to raise your hand and give them realization,
instead of feeling diffident.

01:03:13.373 --> 01:03:17.891
That's why I would say you are all resurrected,

01:03:17.979 --> 01:03:20.832
you are all realized souls,

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.602
and you have to create the Divine paradise on this earth.
