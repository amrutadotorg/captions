00:03:02.792 --> 00:03:12.250
Today we have assembled here to do
the Kundalini Puja.

00:03:12.445 --> 00:03:17.367
Once we had done it in India long, long
time back

00:03:17.568 --> 00:03:26.981
and this is the first time we are doing
this puja here in Austria.

00:03:31.947 --> 00:03:40.184
This is the puja of the Adi Kundalini,
is the Primordial Kundalini.

00:03:41.116 --> 00:03:44.441
[Shri Mataji speaks aside, “Can you just
put it off?”]

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:55.765
You must have seen in the hand of Athena,
who is the Primordial Mother,

00:03:55.966 --> 00:04:07.207
there is a power which is a snake
in the left hand.

00:04:07.408 --> 00:04:09.487
[Shri Mataji speaks aside: “Put it away.

00:04:09.688 --> 00:04:14.182
It’s all right, little far away if you
keep it, it’s all right.

00:04:14.747 --> 00:04:18.455
Yes, little that side it’s all right”.]

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:34.536
And the Primordial Mother has one
of Her powers,

00:04:35.352 --> 00:04:43.730
which we can say, as the Primordial
Kundalini, is a part of Her.

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:52.786
Of course, She's beyond that, but She
is reflected in human beings

00:04:54.466 --> 00:04:58.751
as the Kundalini.

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:05.948
Now one has to know that to create
an incarnation,

00:05:06.825 --> 00:05:10.843
lot of work has gone into.

00:05:11.961 --> 00:05:19.681
So many things had to be envisaged.

00:05:19.882 --> 00:05:31.874
One had to have the vision that, when
a human being is created,

00:05:33.272 --> 00:05:37.921
how an incarnation can help him.

00:05:38.122 --> 00:05:45.745
At different levels, we had incarnations
on this Earth,

00:05:45.946 --> 00:05:51.689
and they were sent with a particular idea

00:05:51.890 --> 00:06:02.805
that they should achieve a particular type
of ascent in that particular time.

00:06:03.716 --> 00:06:10.018
They were all part and parcel
of the Primordial Mother

00:06:10.724 --> 00:06:20.773
And they all had a very powerful Kundalini
built within them.

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:34.360
But the incarnation of this Kali Yuga
is very complicated.

00:06:34.993 --> 00:06:41.785
First it had to be worked out what will be
the situation

00:06:41.986 --> 00:06:46.490
in which this incarnation would be born

00:06:47.728 --> 00:06:56.287
and what sort of encounters this
incarnation would have.

00:07:01.016 --> 00:07:11.204
So, the major propelling force, you can
say,

00:07:11.405 --> 00:07:18.474
or the major work had to be done
in the incarnation

00:07:18.675 --> 00:07:26.329
to create a very strong spinal cord,

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:34.312
so that it could bear the Primordial
Kundalini,

00:07:34.513 --> 00:07:46.864
which is responsible for doing this great
work of transformation.

00:07:50.586 --> 00:07:56.405
Now, this Kundalini, which is
the primordial one,

00:07:57.374 --> 00:08:18.397
has all the powers built-in of redemption,
of ascent.

00:08:24.418 --> 00:08:31.823
But apart from that, to be born in this
Kali Yuga,

00:08:33.728 --> 00:08:42.357
One had to know what sort of people
One has to face

00:08:43.426 --> 00:08:53.401
and then how to bring them round
to the understanding of Sahaja Yoga

00:08:53.602 --> 00:08:59.264
and to the understanding that they have
to have their ascent.

00:09:06.656 --> 00:09:22.489
So, there are many sources of energies
and knowledge which are to be used

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:30.809
because it's a very complicated world in
which the Primordial Kundalini had to work.

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:35.610
It was not a simple thing like people
coming to Himalayas.

00:09:35.811 --> 00:09:43.356
They were already clean people, very
desirous of getting Realization.

00:09:43.557 --> 00:09:51.730
They didn't have all kinds of inhibitions
and conditions and ego.

00:09:51.931 --> 00:09:58.535
They were completely surrendered and
after a great amount of penance,

00:09:58.736 --> 00:10:00.730
they would arrive.

00:10:00.938 --> 00:10:05.823
So to raise their Kundalini was not such
a complicated thing.

00:10:06.024 --> 00:10:14.767
So, not only that, the Primordial Kundalini
had to give ascent to people,

00:10:14.968 --> 00:10:25.943
but She had to also understand what
sort of people are there.

00:10:29.642 --> 00:10:34.133
Why don’t you take out the child?
What’s the matter?

00:10:37.833 --> 00:10:43.248
I think, open the windows, perhaps
the children are feeling hot.

00:11:33.618 --> 00:11:37.239
Normally children don’t cry unless and
until there is some problem, you see.

00:11:37.449 --> 00:11:40.369
You have to be careful.

00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:55.041
So, all the aspects of human beings on
the random movement of human beings,

00:11:55.242 --> 00:12:09.267
all their adventures and enterprises,
were to be understood by the incarnation,

00:12:13.726 --> 00:12:21.215
to communicate with the Primordial
Kundalini.

00:12:22.937 --> 00:12:27.740
And also, such a person had to be
a Mahamaya

00:12:27.941 --> 00:12:37.955
so that She or He, whatever it is, has
to behave in such a manner

00:12:38.156 --> 00:12:51.741
that nobody should feel frightened
or should feel something distant.

00:12:51.947 --> 00:12:56.689
So this Mahamaya Swarupa had to be taken.

00:12:59.138 --> 00:13:04.649
So, the Adi Shakti's work is double fold.

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:13.633
First is to know about the present:
the way the people are,

00:13:13.834 --> 00:13:18.347
their cultures, their styles, their
conditionings, their egos, everything,

00:13:18.519 --> 00:13:21.025
how they behave.

00:13:21.226 --> 00:13:25.687
Though the Adi Shakti is unaware of all
these things because She doesn’t know -

00:13:25.888 --> 00:13:32.721
this is human adventure. She doesn't know
how far they have gone

00:13:33.523 --> 00:13:38.212
and what do they see, what do they dream,
what are their ideas.

00:13:38.413 --> 00:13:44.554
And the another work is of the Kundalini.
So She is divided into two parts.

00:13:44.755 --> 00:13:50.811
One is the Kundalini and another
is the Sahasrara.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:54.102
So [the] Sahasrara has to supply
all the material,

00:13:54.303 --> 00:14:04.185
all the information to the Kundalini and
then the Kundalini has to work out.

00:14:04.386 --> 00:14:09.092
Of course, as you know very well, there
are deities who are built-in

00:14:09.293 --> 00:14:13.801
everywhere in the Sahasrara also,
in the whole body,

00:14:14.002 --> 00:14:20.130
and they are the ones who communicate
whatever has to be communicated properly,

00:14:20.299 --> 00:14:24.991
but it’s a very complicated work, extremely
complicated.

00:14:25.192 --> 00:14:35.079
So this Primordial Kundalini acts for
the collective, Samashti,

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:39.769
as well as for the individual.

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:47.089
Now supposing you go to a place like,
say, an airport.

00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:53.234
So you start absorbing the heat
of the people.

00:14:53.908 --> 00:14:57.452
Then the perspiration starts and you have
to see

00:14:57.653 --> 00:15:03.218
that all this work is done through
your body.

00:15:03.419 --> 00:15:09.925
Or, at the same time, if there’s somebody,
individual, who has some problem,

00:15:10.126 --> 00:15:18.819
also can be absorbed and can be corrected.

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:24.736
So, it acts on both the levels – one on
the individual and one on the collective,

00:15:24.937 --> 00:15:30.083
as they say samashti and vyashti.

00:15:31.089 --> 00:15:34.967
And simultaneously this can act.

00:15:35.168 --> 00:15:41.892
Now the attention, which is the power
of the brain,

00:15:42.093 --> 00:15:49.212
we can say, or power of Sahasrara, also
has to be

00:15:49.413 --> 00:16:00.672
extremely deep, alert and intelligible.

00:16:01.633 --> 00:16:09.117
All this work had to be done to create

00:16:09.755 --> 00:16:15.577
this incarnation of Primordial Kundalini
and the Sahasrara.

00:16:18.918 --> 00:16:31.657
So many mechanisms were used. So many
types of wiring were done, as you do it,

00:16:31.858 --> 00:16:36.809
like as you try to fix your computer
to make it the most efficient one,

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:41.875
in the same way, a lot of work was to be
put in.

00:16:48.551 --> 00:16:58.377
And first You had to watch human beings
for two thousand years,

00:16:58.578 --> 00:17:02.498
how they have been behaving, what they
have been doing

00:17:02.699 --> 00:17:07.440
and now what sort of human beings are
there.

00:17:08.538 --> 00:17:13.433
Every nation had different conditionings.

00:17:13.634 --> 00:17:16.125
Every individual had different
conditioning.

00:17:16.326 --> 00:17:24.015
It's a very difficult work and One had
to have really the ocean of patience,

00:17:24.216 --> 00:17:28.600
inexhaustible ocean of patience.

00:17:28.801 --> 00:17:32.161
And that's how

00:17:36.498 --> 00:17:39.905
this work of Sahaja Yoga, the whole stage
was set in.

00:17:40.106 --> 00:17:46.186
As you have put the stage here, you have
done a marvellous work

00:17:46.387 --> 00:17:53.770
and it looks very nice, beautiful,
everything is there.

00:17:56.370 --> 00:18:04.887
but the stage for Sahaja Yoga was a very
complicated one, extremely complicated.

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:13.079
Because the work was so dynamic, so subtle,

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:23.315
at the same time so loving, so affectionate.

00:18:29.074 --> 00:18:44.489
All the intelligence of the Divine was used
to manufacture this incarnation.

00:18:52.265 --> 00:18:58.114
And to get a human Realization was also
very difficult.

00:18:58.315 --> 00:19:00.856
You had to be born like an ordinary human
being,

00:19:01.057 --> 00:19:04.446
to live in your family like an ordinary
person.

00:19:04.651 --> 00:19:10.305
You had to find out through entering
into everybody's Kundalini

00:19:10.506 --> 00:19:16.340
what was wrong with them, what
was the mistake,

00:19:16.541 --> 00:19:21.592
how you could use the permutations
and combinations

00:19:21.793 --> 00:19:26.769
of their chakras to give them en masse
Realization.

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:34.264
It was a tremendous task and that had to be
done with the Sahasrara.

00:19:39.202 --> 00:19:41.728
But it has been achieved.

00:19:41.929 --> 00:19:56.887
All these great plans of the Divine
and everybody's detailed working

00:19:57.545 --> 00:20:08.129
and bringing everything to a par excellence
level was really tremendous.

00:20:08.318 --> 00:20:16.030
I'm Myself surprised at Myself and amazed

00:20:17.161 --> 00:20:25.243
how I could really get so many people
in Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:30.998
I didn't expect it,

00:20:33.146 --> 00:20:38.015
but it has worked tremendously, because
of the cooperation of human beings also,

00:20:38.216 --> 00:20:42.176
otherwise it would not have been possible.

00:20:44.849 --> 00:20:49.697
Now when you do these pujas and
all those things,

00:20:49.898 --> 00:20:58.751
you please those deities, make them happy
because they have done so much work.

00:20:58.952 --> 00:21:05.587
Is your gratitude for them that they have
worked so hard

00:21:05.788 --> 00:21:10.689
with such diligence, with such precisions

00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:18.382
that today we have been able to achieve
this great drama of Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:18.826 --> 00:21:23.305
Those who are Sahaja Yogis perhaps
do not realize

00:21:23.506 --> 00:21:28.345
what is the great work done in
the background

00:21:28.546 --> 00:21:34.978
and how much time it took to build up
the whole thing,

00:21:35.179 --> 00:21:39.916
to bring it to this level of perfection.

00:21:45.977 --> 00:21:51.768
So the Primordial Kundalini, which
is reflected in you as your Kundalini,

00:21:51.969 --> 00:22:00.838
also is of the same nature and it works
in the same way.

00:22:01.039 --> 00:22:10.842
It rises, gives you Self Realization,
gives you the powers,

00:22:12.973 --> 00:22:19.763
but, after all, one has to know it is
a reflection.

00:22:21.293 --> 00:22:29.001
and a reflection to make it truthful, real,

00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:35.916
you have to look at reality first,

00:22:37.442 --> 00:22:44.254
how the real One, the real Kundalini,

00:22:44.455 --> 00:22:50.905
the real Primordial One, how it acts,
how it works.

00:22:51.106 --> 00:22:54.168
If you start thinking about My Kundalini
only,

00:22:54.369 --> 00:22:58.434
immediately you will become silent,
no question.

00:22:58.635 --> 00:23:03.049
You cannot think, just you'll become
silent.

00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:10.945
Just think of any one of My chakras
and your chakras will be all right.

00:23:11.146 --> 00:23:15.842
But you have to have that depth. You have
to have that much protocol.

00:23:16.026 --> 00:23:20.492
You have to have that much right.
Just it will act.

00:23:20.693 --> 00:23:25.350
Don't have to do anything. Just you have
to think of My chakras.

00:23:25.551 --> 00:23:29.939
Just think about My Kundalini. That's
sufficient.

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:33.530
But you have to develop that surrendering
situation.

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:37.100
Even now there are Sahaja Yogis who doubt.

00:23:37.277 --> 00:23:40.548
They have seen the work, they have seen
everything, still they doubt,

00:23:40.749 --> 00:23:45.896
and they yield to people who are
on the periphery.

00:23:46.097 --> 00:23:50.425
And there are Sahaja Yogis who [are]
still sticking on to many things.

00:23:50.626 --> 00:23:56.268
They cannot change. They haven’t got yet
that courage to change themselves.

00:23:56.469 --> 00:24:00.514
I don't say that you have to change
anything outside,

00:24:00.715 --> 00:24:06.036
but a time comes you might have to change
also, so you should be prepared.

00:24:06.237 --> 00:24:12.577
How much we are courageous, that is to be
weighed and to be found out.

00:24:12.778 --> 00:24:16.218
Unless and until you have full courage,

00:24:16.419 --> 00:24:23.368
you cannot establish Sahaja Yoga
in a quick way.

00:24:23.569 --> 00:24:27.978
When you are using your own Kundalini,
you have to know

00:24:28.179 --> 00:24:34.169
that the Kundalini that is your own has
problems.

00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:38.769
She Herself has gone through various ages
and stages

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:42.610
and She Herself is sometimes very much
hurt,

00:24:42.810 --> 00:24:48.954
very unhappy and very weak, and then
She cannot rise.

00:24:49.155 --> 00:24:55.898
So if you want that this Kundalini that is
your own, that is your own mother

00:24:56.099 --> 00:24:59.360
has to give you all the nourishment and
everything,

00:24:59.561 --> 00:25:06.280
you must learn, first of all, foremost
thing, how to surrender to reality.

00:25:06.481 --> 00:25:12.577
So, if you learn how to surrender
to the Primordial Kundalini,

00:25:12.778 --> 00:25:16.137
then your Kundalini's immediately
strengthened.

00:25:16.338 --> 00:25:21.057
It's like this, supposing you have a stone

00:25:21.258 --> 00:25:29.792
and you try to put anything on it,
it won't reflect.

00:25:29.993 --> 00:25:34.993
Then you improve with the wood, still
nothing will be reflected.

00:25:35.194 --> 00:25:38.289
Then you paint it, some reflection will
come.

00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:42.690
Then you have the glass. The glass won't
reflect.

00:25:42.863 --> 00:25:47.103
But if you use some mercury and make it
a mirror, it will reflect,

00:25:47.265 --> 00:25:49.971
but still it may not be the perfect mirror.

00:25:50.172 --> 00:25:54.650
So this is how the kind of a reflector
you are,

00:25:54.811 --> 00:25:59.005
on that depends the kind of a reflection
you get

00:25:59.206 --> 00:26:02.921
and the kind of personality you develop.

00:26:03.122 --> 00:26:15.316
So there should be no aim as such but
to be dissolved into the reality,

00:26:15.517 --> 00:26:22.137
should be the desire within you. To start
dissolving into it.

00:26:22.338 --> 00:26:25.298
Then one does not have to talk about
detachment.

00:26:25.499 --> 00:26:29.739
One does not have to talk about anything,
about any virtues.

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:33.634
They automatically come because now
you have become the Divine.

00:26:33.835 --> 00:26:37.688
Once you become the Divine, even your
Kundalini becomes

00:26:37.889 --> 00:26:45.248
absolutely, beautifully, completely
reflecting the Primordial One.

00:26:45.449 --> 00:26:48.326
So today I had decided to have this puja

00:26:48.527 --> 00:26:51.022
and to tell you about this Primordial
Kundalini,

00:26:51.223 --> 00:26:55.757
how it has been worked out,
it has been built in

00:26:55.958 --> 00:27:04.343
and it has been given so many powers.

00:27:06.746 --> 00:27:10.625
Formerly, before this kind of Sahaja Yoga,

00:27:10.826 --> 00:27:14.796
people had to cleanse their chakras,
cleanse their body,

00:27:14.997 --> 00:27:17.597
cleanse their mind, do all kinds of things,
tapas

00:27:17.798 --> 00:27:22.752
and then they would think of having
Realization.

00:27:22.953 --> 00:27:26.059
Even Mahavira did twelve years of tapas,

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:29.530
while in Sahaja Yoga none of you have done
any tapas, nothing.

00:27:29.731 --> 00:27:34.636
From the very first day you have been
blessed and you have had blessings

00:27:34.837 --> 00:27:38.186
and you have been enjoying your blessings
throughout.

00:27:38.387 --> 00:27:43.370
So that is a temptation. Remember
it's a temptation.

00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:46.689
Don't get lost with the blessings that
you are having.

00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:49.610
You have to go further and further
and further.

00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:52.275
So it's not a difficult life in Sahaja
Yoga, at all.

00:27:52.476 --> 00:27:57.786
On the contrary, it’s very much easier.
But then people start using Sahaja Yoga

00:27:57.987 --> 00:28:01.055
for certain purposes which secretly they
know

00:28:01.256 --> 00:28:04.570
that they are using Sahaj Yoga for this
purpose and that purpose.

00:28:04.742 --> 00:28:10.723
If you start using Sahaj Yoga for any such
purpose, then again you have a fall,

00:28:10.924 --> 00:28:15.164
then again you have to understand that this
was a wrong thing and then again you rise.

00:28:15.365 --> 00:28:19.499
So people go like this, up and down,
up and down, up and down.

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:24.976
But still, I must say, this Realization
that is given to you, has been given

00:28:25.177 --> 00:28:31.630
without cleansing you, without telling you
anything, without asking for anything,

00:28:31.844 --> 00:28:42.512
without any kind of bondage on you, bandhan
on you, and you got this Realisation.

00:28:42.713 --> 00:28:51.901
But now, immediately after Realization,
you are in the bondage of your Kundalini

00:28:52.118 --> 00:28:55.509
and you have to look after Her and you have
to look after yourself.

00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:59.555
Now you have to identify yourself fully
with your Kundalini

00:28:59.756 --> 00:29:02.431
and then everything works out all right.

00:29:02.632 --> 00:29:06.529
So today is the day when we have to decide

00:29:06.730 --> 00:29:13.370
that our greatest weapon as Austria
is Astra, is Kundalini

00:29:13.571 --> 00:29:19.810
and we should know how to use it,
what mantras to be used,

00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:25.475
what is the problem we have and we should
not be shy of our problem.

00:29:25.684 --> 00:29:31.377
If we have a problem, we should know
this is our problem, it must be corrected.

00:29:31.578 --> 00:29:34.751
Also, we should know the technique fully.

00:29:34.952 --> 00:29:38.827
I find that some people know lot
of techniques

00:29:39.028 --> 00:29:41.600
and also they know how to give big
speeches,

00:29:41.801 --> 00:29:47.003
but they are not good in their hearts.
Their hearts are not clean.

00:29:47.204 --> 00:29:53.770
They want to use their power of speech
just to show off their knowledge.

00:29:53.933 --> 00:29:58.492
Then there are some people who are –
who are such

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:03.263
that they are good in vibrations and they
want to give vibrations,

00:30:03.464 --> 00:30:07.413
but they are afraid, and they don't know
much about the technique.

00:30:07.614 --> 00:30:10.941
So you have to know all these three things
properly,

00:30:11.142 --> 00:30:15.895
if you really want to achieve full results
of your ascent.

00:30:16.096 --> 00:30:19.149
And if you want really to transform
the world,

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:23.888
then you must know you have to be ideal
people. You cannot be problematic people.

00:30:24.089 --> 00:30:29.036
Now see, yesterday I was surprised
how many people there were sick,

00:30:29.237 --> 00:30:33.302
how many people were suffering from this
or that.

00:30:33.503 --> 00:30:36.952
While you should thank your stars that none
of you have any sickness,

00:30:37.153 --> 00:30:39.773
you are perfectly all right, you don't have
bad habits,

00:30:39.974 --> 00:30:42.634
you don't have anything. You have just
come out of it.

00:30:42.835 --> 00:30:47.301
But to go further, you have to have full
determination and understanding

00:30:47.502 --> 00:30:51.393
that this is a tremendous work and
a tremendous task

00:30:51.594 --> 00:30:54.512
and all your powers to be awakened
within yourself,

00:30:54.713 --> 00:31:01.809
you have to be, first of all, fully
equipped with readiness,

00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:08.645
readiness to serve the Divine. Unless
and until you have that readiness,

00:31:08.846 --> 00:31:13.053
that, "I don't want anything. I don't want.
I just want to serve the Divine.”

00:31:13.254 --> 00:31:21.631
As long as you are striving for it and
asking for it with full heart,

00:31:21.832 --> 00:31:26.938
with full sincerity, then I’m sure this
Kundalini will be strengthened

00:31:27.139 --> 00:31:31.494
and She'll cleanse you completely and
you'll be one day Mahayogis.

00:31:31.695 --> 00:31:34.859
May God bless you all.
