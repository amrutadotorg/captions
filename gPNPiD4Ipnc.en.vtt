WEBVTT

03:02.792 --> 03:12.250
Today we have assembled here to do
the Kundalini Puja.

03:12.445 --> 03:17.367
Once we had done it in India long, long
time back

03:17.568 --> 03:26.981
and this is the first time we are doing
this puja here in Austria.

03:31.947 --> 03:40.184
This is the puja of the Adi Kundalini,
is the Primordial Kundalini.

03:41.116 --> 03:44.441
[Shri Mataji speaks aside, “Can you just
put it off?”]

03:44.660 --> 03:55.765
You must have seen in the hand of Athena,
who is the Primordial Mother,

03:55.966 --> 04:07.207
there is a power which is a snake
in the left hand.

04:07.408 --> 04:09.487
[Shri Mataji speaks aside: “Put it away.

04:09.688 --> 04:14.182
It’s all right, little far away if you
keep it, it’s all right.

04:14.747 --> 04:18.455
Yes, little that side it’s all right”.]

04:23.010 --> 04:34.536
And the Primordial Mother has one
of Her powers,

04:35.352 --> 04:43.730
which we can say, as the Primordial
Kundalini, is a part of Her.

04:43.930 --> 04:52.786
Of course, She's beyond that, but She
is reflected in human beings

04:54.466 --> 04:58.751
as the Kundalini.

04:59.010 --> 05:05.948
Now one has to know that to create
an incarnation,

05:06.825 --> 05:10.843
lot of work has gone into.

05:11.961 --> 05:19.681
So many things had to be envisaged.

05:19.882 --> 05:31.874
One had to have the vision that, when
a human being is created,

05:33.272 --> 05:37.921
how an incarnation can help him.

05:38.122 --> 05:45.745
At different levels, we had incarnations
on this Earth,

05:45.946 --> 05:51.689
and they were sent with a particular idea

05:51.890 --> 06:02.805
that they should achieve a particular type
of ascent in that particular time.

06:03.716 --> 06:10.018
They were all part and parcel
of the Primordial Mother

06:10.724 --> 06:20.773
And they all had a very powerful Kundalini
built within them.

06:23.379 --> 06:34.360
But the incarnation of this Kali Yuga
is very complicated.

06:34.993 --> 06:41.785
First it had to be worked out what will be
the situation

06:41.986 --> 06:46.490
in which this incarnation would be born

06:47.728 --> 06:56.287
and what sort of encounters this
incarnation would have.

07:01.016 --> 07:11.204
So, the major propelling force, you can
say,

07:11.405 --> 07:18.474
or the major work had to be done
in the incarnation

07:18.675 --> 07:26.329
to create a very strong spinal cord,

07:26.530 --> 07:34.312
so that it could bear the Primordial
Kundalini,

07:34.513 --> 07:46.864
which is responsible for doing this great
work of transformation.

07:50.586 --> 07:56.405
Now, this Kundalini, which is
the primordial one,

07:57.374 --> 08:18.397
has all the powers built-in of redemption,
of ascent.

08:24.418 --> 08:31.823
But apart from that, to be born in this
Kali Yuga,

08:33.728 --> 08:42.357
One had to know what sort of people
One has to face

08:43.426 --> 08:53.401
and then how to bring them round
to the understanding of Sahaja Yoga

08:53.602 --> 08:59.264
and to the understanding that they have
to have their ascent.

09:06.656 --> 09:22.489
So, there are many sources of energies
and knowledge which are to be used

09:22.690 --> 09:30.809
because it's a very complicated world in
which the Primordial Kundalini had to work.

09:31.010 --> 09:35.610
It was not a simple thing like people
coming to Himalayas.

09:35.811 --> 09:43.356
They were already clean people, very
desirous of getting Realization.

09:43.557 --> 09:51.730
They didn't have all kinds of inhibitions
and conditions and ego.

09:51.931 --> 09:58.535
They were completely surrendered and
after a great amount of penance,

09:58.736 --> 10:00.730
they would arrive.

10:00.938 --> 10:05.823
So to raise their Kundalini was not such
a complicated thing.

10:06.024 --> 10:14.767
So, not only that, the Primordial Kundalini
had to give ascent to people,

10:14.968 --> 10:25.943
but She had to also understand what
sort of people are there.

10:29.642 --> 10:34.133
Why don’t you take out the child?
What’s the matter?

10:37.833 --> 10:43.248
I think, open the windows, perhaps
the children are feeling hot.

11:33.618 --> 11:37.239
Normally children don’t cry unless and
until there is some problem, you see.

11:37.449 --> 11:40.369
You have to be careful.

11:46.210 --> 11:55.041
So, all the aspects of human beings on
the random movement of human beings,

11:55.242 --> 12:09.267
all their adventures and enterprises,
were to be understood by the incarnation,

12:13.726 --> 12:21.215
to communicate with the Primordial
Kundalini.

12:22.937 --> 12:27.740
And also, such a person had to be
a Mahamaya

12:27.941 --> 12:37.955
so that She or He, whatever it is, has
to behave in such a manner

12:38.156 --> 12:51.741
that nobody should feel frightened
or should feel something distant.

12:51.947 --> 12:56.689
So this Mahamaya Swarupa had to be taken.

12:59.138 --> 13:04.649
So, the Adi Shakti's work is double fold.

13:04.850 --> 13:13.633
First is to know about the present:
the way the people are,

13:13.834 --> 13:18.347
their cultures, their styles, their
conditionings, their egos, everything,

13:18.519 --> 13:21.025
how they behave.

13:21.226 --> 13:25.687
Though the Adi Shakti is unaware of all
these things because She doesn’t know -

13:25.888 --> 13:32.721
this is human adventure. She doesn't know
how far they have gone

13:33.523 --> 13:38.212
and what do they see, what do they dream,
what are their ideas.

13:38.413 --> 13:44.554
And the another work is of the Kundalini.
So She is divided into two parts.

13:44.755 --> 13:50.811
One is the Kundalini and another
is the Sahasrara.

13:51.320 --> 13:54.102
So [the] Sahasrara has to supply
all the material,

13:54.303 --> 14:04.185
all the information to the Kundalini and
then the Kundalini has to work out.

14:04.386 --> 14:09.092
Of course, as you know very well, there
are deities who are built-in

14:09.293 --> 14:13.801
everywhere in the Sahasrara also,
in the whole body,

14:14.002 --> 14:20.130
and they are the ones who communicate
whatever has to be communicated properly,

14:20.299 --> 14:24.991
but it’s a very complicated work, extremely
complicated.

14:25.192 --> 14:35.079
So this Primordial Kundalini acts for
the collective, Samashti,

14:35.280 --> 14:39.769
as well as for the individual.

14:39.970 --> 14:47.089
Now supposing you go to a place like,
say, an airport.

14:47.290 --> 14:53.234
So you start absorbing the heat
of the people.

14:53.908 --> 14:57.452
Then the perspiration starts and you have
to see

14:57.653 --> 15:03.218
that all this work is done through
your body.

15:03.419 --> 15:09.925
Or, at the same time, if there’s somebody,
individual, who has some problem,

15:10.126 --> 15:18.819
also can be absorbed and can be corrected.

15:19.020 --> 15:24.736
So, it acts on both the levels – one on
the individual and one on the collective,

15:24.937 --> 15:30.083
as they say samashti and vyashti.

15:31.089 --> 15:34.967
And simultaneously this can act.

15:35.168 --> 15:41.892
Now the attention, which is the power
of the brain,

15:42.093 --> 15:49.212
we can say, or power of Sahasrara, also
has to be

15:49.413 --> 16:00.672
extremely deep, alert and intelligible.

16:01.633 --> 16:09.117
All this work had to be done to create

16:09.755 --> 16:15.577
this incarnation of Primordial Kundalini
and the Sahasrara.

16:18.918 --> 16:31.657
So many mechanisms were used. So many
types of wiring were done, as you do it,

16:31.858 --> 16:36.809
like as you try to fix your computer
to make it the most efficient one,

16:37.010 --> 16:41.875
in the same way, a lot of work was to be
put in.

16:48.551 --> 16:58.377
And first You had to watch human beings
for two thousand years,

16:58.578 --> 17:02.498
how they have been behaving, what they
have been doing

17:02.699 --> 17:07.440
and now what sort of human beings are
there.

17:08.538 --> 17:13.433
Every nation had different conditionings.

17:13.634 --> 17:16.125
Every individual had different
conditioning.

17:16.326 --> 17:24.015
It's a very difficult work and One had
to have really the ocean of patience,

17:24.216 --> 17:28.600
inexhaustible ocean of patience.

17:28.801 --> 17:32.161
And that's how

17:36.498 --> 17:39.905
this work of Sahaja Yoga, the whole stage
was set in.

17:40.106 --> 17:46.186
As you have put the stage here, you have
done a marvellous work

17:46.387 --> 17:53.770
and it looks very nice, beautiful,
everything is there.

17:56.370 --> 18:04.887
but the stage for Sahaja Yoga was a very
complicated one, extremely complicated.

18:07.730 --> 18:13.079
Because the work was so dynamic, so subtle,

18:13.280 --> 18:23.315
at the same time so loving, so affectionate.

18:29.074 --> 18:44.489
All the intelligence of the Divine was used
to manufacture this incarnation.

18:52.265 --> 18:58.114
And to get a human Realization was also
very difficult.

18:58.315 --> 19:00.856
You had to be born like an ordinary human
being,

19:01.057 --> 19:04.446
to live in your family like an ordinary
person.

19:04.651 --> 19:10.305
You had to find out through entering
into everybody's Kundalini

19:10.506 --> 19:16.340
what was wrong with them, what
was the mistake,

19:16.541 --> 19:21.592
how you could use the permutations
and combinations

19:21.793 --> 19:26.769
of their chakras to give them en masse
Realization.

19:26.970 --> 19:34.264
It was a tremendous task and that had to be
done with the Sahasrara.

19:39.202 --> 19:41.728
But it has been achieved.

19:41.929 --> 19:56.887
All these great plans of the Divine
and everybody's detailed working

19:57.545 --> 20:08.129
and bringing everything to a par excellence
level was really tremendous.

20:08.318 --> 20:16.030
I'm Myself surprised at Myself and amazed

20:17.161 --> 20:25.243
how I could really get so many people
in Sahaja Yoga.

20:28.050 --> 20:30.998
I didn't expect it,

20:33.146 --> 20:38.015
but it has worked tremendously, because
of the cooperation of human beings also,

20:38.216 --> 20:42.176
otherwise it would not have been possible.

20:44.849 --> 20:49.697
Now when you do these pujas and
all those things,

20:49.898 --> 20:58.751
you please those deities, make them happy
because they have done so much work.

20:58.952 --> 21:05.587
Is your gratitude for them that they have
worked so hard

21:05.788 --> 21:10.689
with such diligence, with such precisions

21:10.890 --> 21:18.382
that today we have been able to achieve
this great drama of Sahaja Yoga.

21:18.826 --> 21:23.305
Those who are Sahaja Yogis perhaps
do not realize

21:23.506 --> 21:28.345
what is the great work done in
the background

21:28.546 --> 21:34.978
and how much time it took to build up
the whole thing,

21:35.179 --> 21:39.916
to bring it to this level of perfection.

21:45.977 --> 21:51.768
So the Primordial Kundalini, which
is reflected in you as your Kundalini,

21:51.969 --> 22:00.838
also is of the same nature and it works
in the same way.

22:01.039 --> 22:10.842
It rises, gives you Self Realization,
gives you the powers,

22:12.973 --> 22:19.763
but, after all, one has to know it is
a reflection.

22:21.293 --> 22:29.001
and a reflection to make it truthful, real,

22:29.710 --> 22:35.916
you have to look at reality first,

22:37.442 --> 22:44.254
how the real One, the real Kundalini,

22:44.455 --> 22:50.905
the real Primordial One, how it acts,
how it works.

22:51.106 --> 22:54.168
If you start thinking about My Kundalini
only,

22:54.369 --> 22:58.434
immediately you will become silent,
no question.

22:58.635 --> 23:03.049
You cannot think, just you'll become
silent.

23:03.250 --> 23:10.945
Just think of any one of My chakras
and your chakras will be all right.

23:11.146 --> 23:15.842
But you have to have that depth. You have
to have that much protocol.

23:16.026 --> 23:20.492
You have to have that much right.
Just it will act.

23:20.693 --> 23:25.350
Don't have to do anything. Just you have
to think of My chakras.

23:25.551 --> 23:29.939
Just think about My Kundalini. That's
sufficient.

23:30.140 --> 23:33.530
But you have to develop that surrendering
situation.

23:33.730 --> 23:37.100
Even now there are Sahaja Yogis who doubt.

23:37.277 --> 23:40.548
They have seen the work, they have seen
everything, still they doubt,

23:40.749 --> 23:45.896
and they yield to people who are
on the periphery.

23:46.097 --> 23:50.425
And there are Sahaja Yogis who [are]
still sticking on to many things.

23:50.626 --> 23:56.268
They cannot change. They haven’t got yet
that courage to change themselves.

23:56.469 --> 24:00.514
I don't say that you have to change
anything outside,

24:00.715 --> 24:06.036
but a time comes you might have to change
also, so you should be prepared.

24:06.237 --> 24:12.577
How much we are courageous, that is to be
weighed and to be found out.

24:12.778 --> 24:16.218
Unless and until you have full courage,

24:16.419 --> 24:23.368
you cannot establish Sahaja Yoga
in a quick way.

24:23.569 --> 24:27.978
When you are using your own Kundalini,
you have to know

24:28.179 --> 24:34.169
that the Kundalini that is your own has
problems.

24:34.370 --> 24:38.769
She Herself has gone through various ages
and stages

24:38.970 --> 24:42.610
and She Herself is sometimes very much
hurt,

24:42.810 --> 24:48.954
very unhappy and very weak, and then
She cannot rise.

24:49.155 --> 24:55.898
So if you want that this Kundalini that is
your own, that is your own mother

24:56.099 --> 24:59.360
has to give you all the nourishment and
everything,

24:59.561 --> 25:06.280
you must learn, first of all, foremost
thing, how to surrender to reality.

25:06.481 --> 25:12.577
So, if you learn how to surrender
to the Primordial Kundalini,

25:12.778 --> 25:16.137
then your Kundalini's immediately
strengthened.

25:16.338 --> 25:21.057
It's like this, supposing you have a stone

25:21.258 --> 25:29.792
and you try to put anything on it,
it won't reflect.

25:29.993 --> 25:34.993
Then you improve with the wood, still
nothing will be reflected.

25:35.194 --> 25:38.289
Then you paint it, some reflection will
come.

25:38.490 --> 25:42.690
Then you have the glass. The glass won't
reflect.

25:42.863 --> 25:47.103
But if you use some mercury and make it
a mirror, it will reflect,

25:47.265 --> 25:49.971
but still it may not be the perfect mirror.

25:50.172 --> 25:54.650
So this is how the kind of a reflector
you are,

25:54.811 --> 25:59.005
on that depends the kind of a reflection
you get

25:59.206 --> 26:02.921
and the kind of personality you develop.

26:03.122 --> 26:15.316
So there should be no aim as such but
to be dissolved into the reality,

26:15.517 --> 26:22.137
should be the desire within you. To start
dissolving into it.

26:22.338 --> 26:25.298
Then one does not have to talk about
detachment.

26:25.499 --> 26:29.739
One does not have to talk about anything,
about any virtues.

26:29.940 --> 26:33.634
They automatically come because now
you have become the Divine.

26:33.835 --> 26:37.688
Once you become the Divine, even your
Kundalini becomes

26:37.889 --> 26:45.248
absolutely, beautifully, completely
reflecting the Primordial One.

26:45.449 --> 26:48.326
So today I had decided to have this puja

26:48.527 --> 26:51.022
and to tell you about this Primordial
Kundalini,

26:51.223 --> 26:55.757
how it has been worked out,
it has been built in

26:55.958 --> 27:04.343
and it has been given so many powers.

27:06.746 --> 27:10.625
Formerly, before this kind of Sahaja Yoga,

27:10.826 --> 27:14.796
people had to cleanse their chakras,
cleanse their body,

27:14.997 --> 27:17.597
cleanse their mind, do all kinds of things,
tapas

27:17.798 --> 27:22.752
and then they would think of having
Realization.

27:22.953 --> 27:26.059
Even Mahavira did twelve years of tapas,

27:26.260 --> 27:29.530
while in Sahaja Yoga none of you have done
any tapas, nothing.

27:29.731 --> 27:34.636
From the very first day you have been
blessed and you have had blessings

27:34.837 --> 27:38.186
and you have been enjoying your blessings
throughout.

27:38.387 --> 27:43.370
So that is a temptation. Remember
it's a temptation.

27:43.570 --> 27:46.689
Don't get lost with the blessings that
you are having.

27:46.890 --> 27:49.610
You have to go further and further
and further.

27:49.810 --> 27:52.275
So it's not a difficult life in Sahaja
Yoga, at all.

27:52.476 --> 27:57.786
On the contrary, it’s very much easier.
But then people start using Sahaja Yoga

27:57.987 --> 28:01.055
for certain purposes which secretly they
know

28:01.256 --> 28:04.570
that they are using Sahaj Yoga for this
purpose and that purpose.

28:04.742 --> 28:10.723
If you start using Sahaj Yoga for any such
purpose, then again you have a fall,

28:10.924 --> 28:15.164
then again you have to understand that this
was a wrong thing and then again you rise.

28:15.365 --> 28:19.499
So people go like this, up and down,
up and down, up and down.

28:19.700 --> 28:24.976
But still, I must say, this Realization
that is given to you, has been given

28:25.177 --> 28:31.630
without cleansing you, without telling you
anything, without asking for anything,

28:31.844 --> 28:42.512
without any kind of bondage on you, bandhan
on you, and you got this Realisation.

28:42.713 --> 28:51.901
But now, immediately after Realization,
you are in the bondage of your Kundalini

28:52.118 --> 28:55.509
and you have to look after Her and you have
to look after yourself.

28:55.710 --> 28:59.555
Now you have to identify yourself fully
with your Kundalini

28:59.756 --> 29:02.431
and then everything works out all right.

29:02.632 --> 29:06.529
So today is the day when we have to decide

29:06.730 --> 29:13.370
that our greatest weapon as Austria
is Astra, is Kundalini

29:13.571 --> 29:19.810
and we should know how to use it,
what mantras to be used,

29:20.010 --> 29:25.475
what is the problem we have and we should
not be shy of our problem.

29:25.684 --> 29:31.377
If we have a problem, we should know
this is our problem, it must be corrected.

29:31.578 --> 29:34.751
Also, we should know the technique fully.

29:34.952 --> 29:38.827
I find that some people know lot
of techniques

29:39.028 --> 29:41.600
and also they know how to give big
speeches,

29:41.801 --> 29:47.003
but they are not good in their hearts.
Their hearts are not clean.

29:47.204 --> 29:53.770
They want to use their power of speech
just to show off their knowledge.

29:53.933 --> 29:58.492
Then there are some people who are –
who are such

29:58.660 --> 30:03.263
that they are good in vibrations and they
want to give vibrations,

30:03.464 --> 30:07.413
but they are afraid, and they don't know
much about the technique.

30:07.614 --> 30:10.941
So you have to know all these three things
properly,

30:11.142 --> 30:15.895
if you really want to achieve full results
of your ascent.

30:16.096 --> 30:19.149
And if you want really to transform
the world,

30:19.350 --> 30:23.888
then you must know you have to be ideal
people. You cannot be problematic people.

30:24.089 --> 30:29.036
Now see, yesterday I was surprised
how many people there were sick,

30:29.237 --> 30:33.302
how many people were suffering from this
or that.

30:33.503 --> 30:36.952
While you should thank your stars that none
of you have any sickness,

30:37.153 --> 30:39.773
you are perfectly all right, you don't have
bad habits,

30:39.974 --> 30:42.634
you don't have anything. You have just
come out of it.

30:42.835 --> 30:47.301
But to go further, you have to have full
determination and understanding

30:47.502 --> 30:51.393
that this is a tremendous work and
a tremendous task

30:51.594 --> 30:54.512
and all your powers to be awakened
within yourself,

30:54.713 --> 31:01.809
you have to be, first of all, fully
equipped with readiness,

31:02.010 --> 31:08.645
readiness to serve the Divine. Unless
and until you have that readiness,

31:08.846 --> 31:13.053
that, "I don't want anything. I don't want.
I just want to serve the Divine.”

31:13.254 --> 31:21.631
As long as you are striving for it and
asking for it with full heart,

31:21.832 --> 31:26.938
with full sincerity, then I’m sure this
Kundalini will be strengthened

31:27.139 --> 31:31.494
and She'll cleanse you completely and
you'll be one day Mahayogis.

31:31.695 --> 31:34.859
May God bless you all.
