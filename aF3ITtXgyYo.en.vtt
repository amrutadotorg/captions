00:12:15.368 --> 00:12:20.218
Today we are going to worship Shri Krishna as Yogeshwara.

00:12:27.626 --> 00:12:39.151
As it is, you know that Vishnu’s first incarnation as a human being

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:41.578
was Vamana avatar.

00:12:43.863 --> 00:12:52.728
And then went till He came as Shri Ram.

00:12:54.538 --> 00:13:00.685
So, the past of Shri Krishna was Shri Ram.

00:13:00.923 --> 00:13:03.523
And when Shri Rama came on this earth,

00:13:04.554 --> 00:13:09.534
He went into lots of austerities, to go to jungle,

00:13:09.772 --> 00:13:13.443
His wife was lost, whom He had to find out.

00:13:14.137 --> 00:13:19.050
And to establish the benevolent king

00:13:20.499 --> 00:13:29.903
on this earth, He was made the king of Ayodhya.

00:13:33.712 --> 00:13:44.328
But all His life it was a struggle
and austerities which He followed.

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.467
As a result, the people who followed Shri Ram

00:13:48.654 --> 00:13:51.094
became extremely austere.

00:13:52.126 --> 00:13:57.642
They used to sleep on the grass

00:13:58.773 --> 00:14:02.906
because Shri Ram had to sleep on the grass for so many years.

00:14:03.902 --> 00:14:07.949
They used to wear wooden slippers.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:15.509
They would just wear very little clothes or one dhoti,

00:14:15.708 --> 00:14:19.953
just like Shri Rama wore when His wife was out.

00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:28.422
All these austerities they did to show how a householder should be.

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:37.073
He never enjoyed any other life as a man,

00:14:37.951 --> 00:14:45.426
but just lived like an ascetic when His wife was lost.

00:14:48.611 --> 00:14:54.772
All these things were to establish also a very

00:14:55.387 --> 00:15:02.530
ideal personality for a man to be attached to His wife.

00:15:04.058 --> 00:15:09.077
He was a person with Ekapatnivrata, means: one wife.

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:14.977
Though She knew She was Mahalakshmi, She was a Goddess,

00:15:15.692 --> 00:15:26.227
but still He was forced to do things

00:15:26.505 --> 00:15:30.372
because He wanted to show how a benevolent king should be.

00:15:35.315 --> 00:15:40.672
In the second incarnation of His, when He came as Shri Krishna,

00:15:42.637 --> 00:15:48.986
then He had to neutralize
all these austerities He has put on people.

00:17:14.241 --> 00:17:19.142
– Ha. So, Shri Krishna came on this earth.

00:17:23.885 --> 00:17:29.238
In His childhood He had to also face lots of

00:17:29.496 --> 00:17:32.412
problems which He surpassed,

00:17:35.964 --> 00:17:43.305
and He went and killed His uncle, as you know very well,

00:17:44.107 --> 00:17:46.209
who was a rakshasa.

00:17:47.202 --> 00:17:54.258
After doing all this, then He went to Dwarika, which He built

00:17:54.695 --> 00:17:57.374
– now they have found out where is Dwarika

00:17:57.572 --> 00:17:59.972
– and He became the king of Dwarika.

00:18:06.303 --> 00:18:08.103
To understand Shri Krishna

00:18:10.172 --> 00:18:15.624
in Sahaja Yoga is much more subtler
than the stories that they tell.

00:18:15.744 --> 00:18:17.677
[aside] … move it – better. ?

00:18:21.569 --> 00:18:24.803
The stories are there,

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.461
but behind these stories,

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:31.460
as being Sahaja Yogis, you have to see the subtle things

00:18:31.847 --> 00:18:35.160
about His incarnation.

00:18:36.192 --> 00:18:41.106
So, the first one was, He was Leeladhara,

00:18:42.258 --> 00:18:45.124
means the One who said this is all a play.

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:49.753
That means you have to become a witness.

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:54.470
So, He said that your mind should become just a witness.

00:18:57.297 --> 00:19:01.461
At Virata stage He becomes Akbar.

00:19:02.176 --> 00:19:08.584
And at that stage He is the mind, the brain of

00:19:11.084 --> 00:19:12.951
the great primordial Being.

00:19:14.636 --> 00:19:21.937
So, first He thinks that we have to become witness,

00:19:23.376 --> 00:19:24.843
witness of the drama,

00:19:26.193 --> 00:19:33.764
and we should not get lost into the Maya.

00:19:50.708 --> 00:19:57.057
If you are a witness you can see the Maya, how it works.

00:19:58.188 --> 00:20:07.267
So the first, first subtle nature
of Shri Krishna was to create a Leela

00:20:07.625 --> 00:20:13.894
to neutralize all the austerities
created by the incarnation of Shri Rama.

00:20:15.045 --> 00:20:19.640
But the second great quality

00:20:20.811 --> 00:20:26.128
that He had is also to put the Maya on people.

00:20:28.648 --> 00:20:34.878
So, if He is the brain, our brain should become a sakshi,

00:20:35.811 --> 00:20:40.041
should become a witness, witness the play.

00:20:40.855 --> 00:20:46.985
You should not take anything as something extremely serious.

00:20:47.819 --> 00:20:51.688
When you look at things as sakshi swarupa, as

00:20:51.847 --> 00:20:54.580
something that you are watching a drama,

00:20:54.922 --> 00:21:00.398
you may for the time being feel that you are Napoleon,
you are the one who is acting.

00:21:00.577 --> 00:21:02.974
But after some time the play is over,

00:21:03.133 --> 00:21:08.490
you know it’s a play. So, to reach that state, you have to

00:21:09.681 --> 00:21:14.125
become thoughtlessly aware.

00:21:15.217 --> 00:21:17.875
Because we think from our brain,

00:21:18.729 --> 00:21:23.073
and this brain goes on thinking, thinking, creating a Maya,

00:21:23.887 --> 00:21:25.952
and playing into Maya.

00:21:26.642 --> 00:21:32.897
Now, here it is when you are a realized soul,
you should see through the Maya.

00:21:33.988 --> 00:21:39.841
Everything that I am doing or you are doing,

00:21:41.726 --> 00:21:49.332
should be understood very well if you are really

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:54.768
the reflection of Shri Krishna’s brain.

00:21:56.277 --> 00:22:00.622
So, in your brain, there should be no worry,

00:22:01.078 --> 00:22:04.745
there should be no stress, there should be no problem,

00:22:06.912 --> 00:22:10.911
because you are just watching everything

00:22:11.229 --> 00:22:13.689
in thoughtless awareness.

00:22:14.384 --> 00:22:17.051
So, when you are thoughtless awareness,

00:22:17.618 --> 00:22:23.510
means when your brain is just in the state of witness,

00:22:24.761 --> 00:22:29.773
you understand everything that is Divine.

00:22:30.091 --> 00:22:33.291
I’ll give you an example, just now it happened.

00:22:33.444 --> 00:22:38.087
I got into the car and they didn’t know where to go,

00:22:38.802 --> 00:22:42.935
and we went onto wrong road, then I told him ” Go this way “.

00:22:43.742 --> 00:22:48.009
So he was wondering ” How Mother knows?” I said ” Vibrations! ”

00:22:50.394 --> 00:22:54.420
Through vibrations I could feel we are ther
– they are all there, sitting there,

00:22:54.678 --> 00:22:56.012
– and we came round.

00:22:58.984 --> 00:23:04.651
Unless and untill you are thoughtlessly aware,
you cannot grow, that is first thing.

00:23:05.036 --> 00:23:12.535
And secondly, unless and until you are thoughtlessly aware,
you do not know the absolute Truth.

00:23:13.885 --> 00:23:16.485
Through your brain only you will know.

00:23:17.513 --> 00:23:21.980
You don’t have to put your hands, you don’t have to ask questions.

00:23:22.307 --> 00:23:27.981
But it’s like a computer that works, it just gives you an answer.

00:23:29.113 --> 00:23:32.713
In that state you are completely one with the Divine,

00:23:32.922 --> 00:23:35.878
and it just gives you an answer,

00:23:36.335 --> 00:23:40.202
and you do that and you are amazed how it has worked out.

00:23:41.526 --> 00:23:45.459
Everything, every moment is computerized with Shri Krishna.

00:23:47.637 --> 00:23:51.069
But at the same time He tests you,

00:23:52.498 --> 00:23:56.605
He plays His Leela on you. That one must know,

00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:58.927
because He’s a diplomat.

00:24:00.137 --> 00:24:04.935
How He has played Leela on you is very interesting to see,

00:24:06.047 --> 00:24:07.313
His style of Leela.

00:24:09.459 --> 00:24:10.926
Like He’s told Arjuna

00:24:18.224 --> 00:24:20.024
that ” I will not fight “.

00:24:25.324 --> 00:24:28.815
Arjuna said: ” All right, what will you do? ”

00:24:28.974 --> 00:24:32.387
” I’ll be your charioteer,

00:24:32.707 --> 00:24:34.374
I’ll drive your chariot.

00:24:34.969 --> 00:24:39.062
” Now it would look funny to anybody: ”
What is this, such a great man

00:24:39.321 --> 00:24:41.614
who calls me as His guru,

00:24:41.872 --> 00:24:44.005
He says that He is the one who,

00:24:44.214 --> 00:24:47.408
I mean, He says that I am the best of His disciples,

00:24:47.547 --> 00:24:53.462
everything, and here He just offers
His services like a charioteer. ”

00:24:55.552 --> 00:25:03.758
In this, He is just trying a trick on Arjuna.

00:25:07.251 --> 00:25:10.584
As if He knows the future that’s going to happen.

00:25:11.874 --> 00:25:17.925
So, the whole Gita was created because He was just a charioteer,

00:25:19.019 --> 00:25:23.185
because Arjuna said ” I cannot fight my own people,

00:25:24.262 --> 00:25:31.614
I cannot fight my own grandparents,
and I cannot fight my relations. ”

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:36.800
Now, if you say that Gita is for peace, it is not.

00:25:39.432 --> 00:25:40.832
It is not for peace.

00:25:42.844 --> 00:25:47.178
But He says that: ” They are already dead, whom are you killing?

00:25:48.896 --> 00:25:52.963
These dead people, if you are killing them what will happen?

00:25:53.764 --> 00:25:57.931
But if you now run away from the battlefield,

00:25:58.526 --> 00:26:01.740
people will call you a coward,

00:26:03.586 --> 00:26:07.453
and what will you get? But if you fight for the religion,

00:26:09.598 --> 00:26:15.971
then you will get your resurrection – moksha.”

00:26:17.261 --> 00:26:19.794
It’s a big trick in all these things.

00:26:20.613 --> 00:26:26.002
Same was said by Mohammed Sahib, and same by Christians later,

00:26:26.658 --> 00:26:33.482
same about the Hindus
– that they all feel they are fighting for Dharma.

00:26:36.896 --> 00:26:39.696
In Arjuna’s case, it was a clear-cut case

00:26:40.249 --> 00:26:44.665
that somebody was a rakshasa and horrible people,

00:26:44.804 --> 00:26:48.871
they were adharmis, so He was fighting them, it’s all right.

00:26:51.868 --> 00:26:57.601
But what about other people when they say that ” We are going to

00:26:57.979 --> 00:27:05.038
die for religion “? I met a Bosnia muslim
who had just somewhere escaped

00:27:05.534 --> 00:27:08.958
and I asked Him ” Why, why do you want to fight?

00:27:09.137 --> 00:27:17.252
Why do you want to fight for land
when you believe in the formless God? ”

00:27:17.649 --> 00:27:21.887
He said: ” It’s written in the Koran that if you fight for religion

00:27:22.185 --> 00:27:27.051
then you will get your moksha.
” Exactly the same Shri Krishna has said.

00:27:30.181 --> 00:27:31.914
But where is the mistake?

00:27:33.494 --> 00:27:37.045
The mistake is: what is the Dharma?

00:27:39.573 --> 00:27:45.574
Are you dharmic? Are you in – standing in Dharma?

00:27:47.367 --> 00:27:52.538
Then this fight was in those days, were with weapons.

00:27:53.193 --> 00:27:56.926
So, why did Shri Krishna not take a weapon in His hand?

00:27:58.748 --> 00:28:03.430
This is the second. Firstly, nobody has Dharma,

00:28:03.709 --> 00:28:07.180
they’re all adharmis
– they may call themselves hindus, muslims, christians

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:10.171
– all are adharmis, they don’t follow the religion.

00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:14.615
And secondly, they are killing each other only,

00:28:14.754 --> 00:28:17.088
one adharmi killing other adharmi,

00:28:17.215 --> 00:28:20.409
or maybe in between themselves they are fighting: everybody

00:28:20.548 --> 00:28:24.882
is thinking ” I am right and whatever I am doing is the right. ”

00:28:25.646 --> 00:28:30.046
So, the first condition is put that for Dharma you have to fight.

00:28:30.206 --> 00:28:34.140
So first, one should find out: are we fighting for Dharma?

00:28:36.278 --> 00:28:38.420
But He was even subtler,

00:28:39.115 --> 00:28:42.448
He didn’t take any weapons in His hands, nothing.

00:28:43.155 --> 00:28:47.380
He was just holding the reins of the chariot.

00:28:49.067 --> 00:28:52.222
Because Shri Krishna is the mind,

00:28:52.639 --> 00:28:58.015
is the Virat, is the great Mind,
He doesn’t need any weapons or such.

00:28:59.266 --> 00:29:01.266
But what He did at that time,

00:29:01.528 --> 00:29:07.971
He used His mind for a very very profound knowledge,

00:29:09.241 --> 00:29:12.441
to explain to Arjuna. Imagine, in the warfield,

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:16.481
He didn’t make Him sit down
” All right, you are my Shishya, you sit here,

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:18.800
I am your guru, I’ll tell you. ”

00:29:19.398 --> 00:29:21.998
– nothing. In the battlefield you see,

00:29:23.069 --> 00:29:29.767
when everybody was there to fight
and they were about to start the war,

00:29:30.739 --> 00:29:39.409
He starts telling very patiently to Arjuna, at that time.

00:29:40.878 --> 00:29:46.039
Now, what is He doing there? He’s not using any weapons, nothing.

00:29:46.218 --> 00:29:54.591
He is being counselling, counselling to Arjuna, telling him.

00:29:56.417 --> 00:29:59.333
Now, see His subtle brain.

00:30:01.476 --> 00:30:05.087
He introduces in the first chapter only that

00:30:05.206 --> 00:30:08.206
” You have to go higher then what you are. ”

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:11.735
And then He gives him

00:30:12.172 --> 00:30:17.705
the definition of a person who
is an enlightened person which is a Sthitha Pragya.

00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:23.402
I mean, normally, a businessman will start

00:30:23.501 --> 00:30:27.350
from one dollar, then hundred dollars,
you see, the other way round.

00:30:27.529 --> 00:30:30.239
But He told him first thing

00:30:30.795 --> 00:30:35.328
that ” You have to become a Sthitha Pragya, otherwise it’s no use.”

00:30:36.706 --> 00:30:41.306
Unless and until you become
Sthitha Pragya you cannot have Dharma,

00:30:41.469 --> 00:30:42.736
this is the point.

00:30:43.374 --> 00:30:46.630
To understand Shri Krishna, you have to really have a very

00:30:46.746 --> 00:30:49.150
subtle brain, otherwise you cannot understand.

00:30:50.778 --> 00:30:54.247
So, He tells that ” You should

00:30:55.318 --> 00:31:01.111
give up this kind of a morose that has developed in you,

00:31:01.211 --> 00:31:02.958
Kaivalya I will call it.

00:31:03.812 --> 00:31:08.117
And what you have to do, now take up the weapon in your hand

00:31:08.355 --> 00:31:09.783
and fight. ”

00:31:14.526 --> 00:31:20.096
So, then, He asked him about other things,

00:31:21.605 --> 00:31:25.235
” What about that: You are here telling me

00:31:25.453 --> 00:31:27.653
that you should become Nishkriya,

00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:33.015
that means “no work”. Your karmas become akarmas.

00:31:33.234 --> 00:31:34.900
Now, talking like this,

00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:39.260
and why do you want me to kill these people – that is akarma? ”

00:31:40.594 --> 00:31:44.356
Now, how you see, slowly removes from one point

00:31:44.633 --> 00:31:48.324
that you should fight for Dharma. Now, it’s a very subtle thing:

00:31:48.504 --> 00:31:51.771
are you in Dharma or not, first of all find out?

00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:58.285
You are not, so what Dharma you fight, first?

00:31:58.782 --> 00:32:01.539
Then, the second thing is karma.

00:32:03.224 --> 00:32:09.050
Again, see, He is a brainy fellow, the brains of God,

00:32:09.775 --> 00:32:11.580
extremely tricky.

00:32:12.516 --> 00:32:17.476
The second trick He plays on Him saying that

00:32:19.619 --> 00:32:28.880
” You are working, all right? But if you are a Sthitha Pragya,

00:32:30.706 --> 00:32:36.519
then you leave all the work at the lotus feet of God ” or Him.

00:32:37.591 --> 00:32:40.824
[Hindi phrase, UNCLEAR]

00:32:41.202 --> 00:32:43.523
“Give up all Dharmas and follow Me. ”

00:32:45.641 --> 00:32:47.241
Now what is his Dharma?

00:32:48.558 --> 00:32:51.311
That problem is that people don’t understand Him.

00:32:51.450 --> 00:32:54.922
It’s all concentrated on Shri Krishna, and

00:32:55.081 --> 00:33:00.041
His own manifestation.

00:33:00.538 --> 00:33:02.482
[aside]

00:33:06.649 --> 00:33:09.854
He says that ” Do your karmas.

00:33:10.629 --> 00:33:14.815
But you put them at the lotus feet of the Lord! ”

00:33:15.886 --> 00:33:19.953
– It’s not possible unless and until you are Sthitha Pragya,

00:33:20.172 --> 00:33:22.148
unless and until you are enlightened.

00:33:22.248 --> 00:33:26.378
Now, when you are enlightened,
when you have got your realization,

00:33:26.481 --> 00:33:30.838
when you raise your Kundalini or anybody’s Kundalini,

00:33:31.176 --> 00:33:36.791
you don’t say ” Mother, I am giving realization “.
You don’t say that, never.

00:33:37.704 --> 00:33:41.989
What you say: ” It is happening “, in third person you talk. ”

00:33:42.366 --> 00:33:46.833
It’s not coming, it’s not working or it’s just moving on the side.

00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:49.568
This chakra is catching, that chakra is catching.

00:33:49.728 --> 00:33:54.033
” You never say ” I am doing anything “, the ‘I’ is lost.

00:33:56.176 --> 00:34:04.201
When that ‘I’ is lost, than only
you will put everything at the lotus feet of God.

00:34:04.678 --> 00:34:07.278
So, first, it should be done in Dharma.

00:34:07.633 --> 00:34:11.066
Supposing, somebody murders somebody and say ” Oh, I have

00:34:11.245 --> 00:34:15.471
done it now, so it is my karmas
and I put it at the lotus feet of Shri Krishna. ”

00:34:15.848 --> 00:34:19.648
Now, people can, I mean, people have special brains also

00:34:20.372 --> 00:34:23.536
to interprete Shri Krishna and Gita.

00:34:24.667 --> 00:34:27.484
But what He said for Dharma you should do it.

00:34:28.059 --> 00:34:33.326
So, first of all, you should be
a Sthitha Pragya, means an enlightened person,

00:34:33.496 --> 00:34:35.491
and whatever you do

00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:39.750
automatically goes at the lotus feet of God, automatically,

00:34:40.016 --> 00:34:42.178
spontaneously, Sahaj.

00:34:45.929 --> 00:34:48.458
Now, the third thing He did:

00:34:49.133 --> 00:34:52.247
What about bhakti? People said ” What?

00:34:52.406 --> 00:34:57.606
We are doing bhakti to God, this,
that, then what is the reward for this? ”

00:34:57.764 --> 00:34:59.698
There again He plays tricks.

00:35:00.681 --> 00:35:04.081
On one word He has made everybody dance, you know?

00:35:05.621 --> 00:35:10.630
He says ” You do bhakti, but it should be Ananya, ”

00:35:10.804 --> 00:35:15.114
– this is the word, Ananya, – when there is not the other,

00:35:15.631 --> 00:35:19.539
means when you have become One with Me,

00:35:20.035 --> 00:35:24.235
means you are a Sthitha Pragya, means you are a realized soul.

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:31.337
Just imagine, on this word if people pay attention,

00:35:31.575 --> 00:35:34.642
they will give up all this nonsense of bhakti

00:35:35.007 --> 00:35:40.860
and will first get their connection when they become Ananya

00:35:41.019 --> 00:35:42.619
and then do the bhakti.

00:35:44.492 --> 00:35:47.825
Because Shri Krishna knew human beings very well.

00:35:48.262 --> 00:35:52.429
I think, He knew them better than Christ
– definitely

00:35:53.631 --> 00:35:56.663
– because Christ was straightforward.

00:35:56.862 --> 00:35:59.759
He said: ” Take out your right eye, throw it away.

00:35:59.898 --> 00:36:02.318
Take out your left eye, throw it away.

00:36:02.438 --> 00:36:04.371
Cut your hand, throw it away.

00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:07.766
” Same with Mohammed Sahib. Who will do that?

00:36:09.283 --> 00:36:14.044
So, Shri Krishna was very clever, He said:

00:36:14.243 --> 00:36:17.043
straightforward they will not understand,

00:36:17.195 --> 00:36:21.877
so give them in such a way that they will go on doing and doing,

00:36:22.013 --> 00:36:25.905
we are doing so much bhakti, so many people come into it.
Even this Ram,

00:36:26.103 --> 00:36:29.912
Hari Ramas, they are developing now throat cancers.

00:36:30.191 --> 00:36:33.901
So, they are saying ” Mother, why these throat cancer to us,

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:38.907
we are saying the name of Sri Krishna?”
” Because you are not connected.”

00:36:40.002 --> 00:36:45.113
Now supposing, I will even want to
meet the president of this country.

00:36:45.590 --> 00:36:50.192
I’ll have to go through such a protocol. I may not even meet.

00:36:53.129 --> 00:36:57.216
But this One is the God of Gods.

00:36:58.585 --> 00:37:01.452
He is the President of all the presidents.

00:37:03.305 --> 00:37:08.254
If you have to take His name, if you go and take name of Lincoln,

00:37:08.354 --> 00:37:13.820
of Clinton, and go on saying
” Clinton, Clinton Clinton “, they’ll all arrest Me.

00:37:14.782 --> 00:37:21.190
So, if you go on saying ” Rama, Rama, Rama,
Allah, Allah, Allah, Akbar, Akbar, Akbar “, you’ll be arrested.

00:37:21.350 --> 00:37:22.950
You have no connection.

00:37:25.497 --> 00:37:28.030
So, that Virata Shakti which we call,

00:37:29.877 --> 00:37:33.508
which is of course in Koran described as Akbar,

00:37:36.048 --> 00:37:40.254
this power also plays tricks.

00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:50.512
As a Mother, I have to warn you

00:37:52.459 --> 00:37:59.474
that nothing will work out
unless (and) until you are a realized soul.

00:38:00.288 --> 00:38:04.851
Nothing will work out. Now, for realization,

00:38:05.725 --> 00:38:08.192
He has said: ” You have to become “.

00:38:08.582 --> 00:38:11.915
But He didn’t say at that time

00:38:12.788 --> 00:38:17.339
how you will become, what will work it out.

00:38:19.104 --> 00:38:22.304
Because you see, sort of, if you go to college,

00:38:22.453 --> 00:38:25.519
all the knowledge is not given in first year.

00:38:25.672 --> 00:38:28.271
Something is given, then something in second year,

00:38:28.410 --> 00:38:33.077
then in third year. Now in the seventh year,
now Sahaja Yoga has come

00:38:33.272 --> 00:38:35.831
to tell you everything, totally.

00:38:37.518 --> 00:38:43.129
He is Totality, but He doesn’t give total knowledge.

00:38:44.161 --> 00:38:46.761
The whole knowledge of Gita is nothing

00:38:47.016 --> 00:38:51.283
but trick that He has played with human beings who were stupid,

00:38:51.461 --> 00:38:53.585
and would never have understood Him

00:38:53.784 --> 00:38:56.318
if He’d told them about Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:56.463 --> 00:38:59.463
Even today I meet many like that, of course,

00:39:00.014 --> 00:39:04.574
but so many He could not have got at that time.

00:39:05.329 --> 00:39:11.003
So, they didn’t talk about Kundalini this much, so far,

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:13.066
and that’s all.

00:39:16.658 --> 00:39:19.050
Same with other people.

00:39:19.367 --> 00:39:24.220
The kind of disciples they had, the kind of people they had,

00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:30.225
they could not tell them everything about

00:39:30.642 --> 00:39:35.363
their ascent, because they were not ready,

00:39:35.602 --> 00:39:40.002
they were not of that level, their brains were not that developed.

00:39:40.285 --> 00:39:43.942
Now in this Kali Yuga, when I am starting this work,

00:39:44.181 --> 00:39:47.712
I find their brains are overdeveloped, over.

00:39:49.816 --> 00:39:54.121
And so much so that overdeveloped brains become stupid

00:39:54.312 --> 00:39:59.696
and that’s really. Overuse of anything makes you stupid,

00:40:00.927 --> 00:40:04.490
and they become absolutely stupid.

00:40:05.919 --> 00:40:09.482
Now, how can you tell them such a subtle knowledge

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:14.383
who are stupid people? What is the way?

00:40:15.356 --> 00:40:18.411
If I talk like Shri Krishna

00:40:18.986 --> 00:40:22.490
it would have been just a waste of My energy

00:40:22.709 --> 00:40:26.575
and your energy. Half of you would have gone off to sleep.

00:40:26.836 --> 00:40:31.478
So I said, first of all, let Me connect them to Divinity.

00:40:32.034 --> 00:40:36.434
If I could connect them to Divinity – little bit even, little bit

00:40:36.637 --> 00:40:38.571
– then they will understand.

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:42.400
Because that will enlighten their brain a little bit,

00:40:42.874 --> 00:40:46.596
and they will know that there’s something more than what we know.

00:40:47.033 --> 00:40:49.633
And that’s how it is going to work out.

00:40:50.128 --> 00:40:54.396
So the subtle system of trickery of Shri Krishna

00:40:54.594 --> 00:40:57.610
has helped a lot, no doubt, that people are realizing

00:40:57.829 --> 00:41:03.161
that there is something missing in it. Even of Islam

00:41:04.570 --> 00:41:10.879
– Islam means surrender – but surrender to whom? To mullahs

00:41:11.594 --> 00:41:20.127
– or to whom? The problem started when
[Hijak, a name – UNCLEAR] he started like that.

00:41:20.345 --> 00:41:22.916
There are mullahs and there are this.

00:41:23.095 --> 00:41:25.448
So, the surrender part became

00:41:25.568 --> 00:41:31.101
surrender to these stupid mullahs.
I’ve seen most of them are absolutely stupid.

00:41:31.777 --> 00:41:35.125
And they take a cane in their hands in the other, you see

00:41:35.288 --> 00:41:37.488
they beat, even women they beat.

00:41:37.645 --> 00:41:40.146
You are supposed to do Pujas five times

00:41:40.265 --> 00:41:44.094
and if you don’t do them, Pujas five times,
they call it silla [UNCLEAR],

00:41:44.253 --> 00:41:49.265
then they beat women. Every shop must be closed five times.

00:41:50.872 --> 00:41:55.515
I tell you, they are such hypocritical people naturally,

00:41:56.487 --> 00:42:00.421
because if you are asked to do five times meditation, say,

00:42:01.110 --> 00:42:04.244
you will never do it, but you will just do it out of fear.

00:42:04.412 --> 00:42:07.612
Out of fear if you do something, what’s the use?

00:42:09.436 --> 00:42:13.236
Now, whatever Muhammed Sahib has said or Christ has said,

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:19.297
it is only for angels, I can tell you, not for normal people.

00:42:20.607 --> 00:42:26.460
And where are the angels? Very few there are:

00:42:26.975 --> 00:42:30.909
those are born-realized people who have come on this earth

00:42:31.070 --> 00:42:38.589
are angels. And they are told not to do something they will not do.

00:42:39.125 --> 00:42:42.788
Most of them know what is right and wrong.

00:42:42.991 --> 00:42:45.258
Where are those angels, very few?

00:42:46.479 --> 00:42:51.379
And those who are angels are treated just like, you can call it,

00:42:52.767 --> 00:42:57.243
like packed people or lunatic people, – nobody believes them.

00:42:57.740 --> 00:43:02.164
One here and one there and one in some other place.

00:43:02.859 --> 00:43:08.295
So this, what they preached was for the angels.

00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:11.137
Only the angels could understand.

00:43:11.355 --> 00:43:15.349
But Shri Krishna thought that these other people who are there,

00:43:15.483 --> 00:43:18.150
who are not angels, why not trick them?

00:43:19.709 --> 00:43:25.109
Many people come and tell me: ”
We take the name of Krishna every day like this,

00:43:25.246 --> 00:43:27.512
and we haven’t received anything.

00:43:28.281 --> 00:43:32.014
” But first He said, ” You have to be Sthitha Pragya. ”

00:43:32.328 --> 00:43:37.655
Sthitha Pragya: ‘Sthitha’ means established,

00:43:38.389 --> 00:43:41.266
‘Pragya’ means enlightened,

00:43:42.258 --> 00:43:49.182
– you should be enlightened personality, absolutely established.

00:43:49.870 --> 00:43:53.470
First thing, first thing you see, in a second chapter.

00:43:53.818 --> 00:43:58.639
First thing is it. After that He says all these things,

00:43:59.195 --> 00:44:04.671
and that’s why many people have misunderstood Gita.

00:44:05.267 --> 00:44:08.800
But His idea was: in one life they’ll misunderstand,

00:44:09.034 --> 00:44:11.367
second life they’ll misunderstand,

00:44:11.514 --> 00:44:15.544
third life they will start thinking ” After all, what is this?”

00:44:15.683 --> 00:44:20.167
First, He has said “You become a Sthitha Pragya”,
we have not become a Sthitha Pragya.

00:44:20.385 --> 00:44:22.252
So, what’s wrong with us? ”

00:44:23.143 --> 00:44:25.477
So, some introspection will start.

00:44:25.921 --> 00:44:29.174
That was His idea, idea I should say.

00:44:29.807 --> 00:44:36.295
But I have seen people
who can give lectures on Gita hours together,

00:44:36.613 --> 00:44:40.680
but their brains are closed completely.

00:44:42.883 --> 00:44:47.283
Now, to say that He didn’t say anything about Kundalini is there.

00:44:47.803 --> 00:44:53.707
That’s why Gyaneshwara in
the twelvth century took permission from his brother

00:44:54.184 --> 00:44:58.851
who was his guru that ”Allow me, at least, to say about Kundalini.”

00:44:59.779 --> 00:45:02.779
And that is how it was exposed a little bit.

00:45:03.695 --> 00:45:05.949
Of course, before that also,

00:45:06.345 --> 00:45:12.656
we have had people like Adi Shankaracharya, the sixth century,

00:45:13.152 --> 00:45:16.838
and before that also Markandeya.

00:45:17.709 --> 00:45:24.219
But they talked about the Kundalini,
that’s all, praised the Kundalini.

00:45:25.212 --> 00:45:30.212
But that She passes through six centers,
how will It raise and all that.

00:45:30.747 --> 00:45:34.547
And not about the future, that this will happen one day.

00:45:35.246 --> 00:45:37.446
So many have written, of course.

00:45:37.679 --> 00:45:43.013
But I would say that precisely the one who has written

00:45:43.624 --> 00:45:48.668
complete description of Sahaja Yogis even is by Gyaneshwara

00:45:48.926 --> 00:45:55.612
in the poetry called Pasaydan in which
he exactly said what will happen,

00:45:56.228 --> 00:46:00.255
how many people will get realization

00:46:00.672 --> 00:46:03.005
and he said that ” You the people,

00:46:03.995 --> 00:46:17.427
who are the forests of the trees,
boon-giving trees, Kalpakaruna, boon-giving trees,

00:46:17.983 --> 00:46:22.486
you rise and give it to others.

00:46:22.775 --> 00:46:29.993
” Then he says that ” You are the oceans who are

00:46:31.308 --> 00:46:34.398
giving ambrosia talks.”

00:46:35.272 --> 00:46:38.472
He has described you in such a beautiful manner

00:46:39.399 --> 00:46:42.665
that you should read the translation of Pasaydan

00:46:43.069 --> 00:46:45.536
and then you will know what you are,

00:46:45.807 --> 00:46:51.607
how you have been praised by him.
And he said that you will loose other relationship

00:46:51.838 --> 00:46:54.638
and the only relationships will be these.

00:46:55.290 --> 00:46:58.088
They will be your real relations.

00:46:58.604 --> 00:47:01.804
To say all these things, to have such a vision,

00:47:01.945 --> 00:47:05.548
he must be a great incarnation himself.

00:47:06.084 --> 00:47:16.311
So, this is how in Gyaneshwari, which is a commentary of Gita,

00:47:16.469 --> 00:47:20.603
he has put in the sixth chapter, now is a commentary on Gita,

00:47:20.776 --> 00:47:25.242
but in the sixth chapter he said how you can get your realization.

00:47:26.173 --> 00:47:28.773
About Kundalini, how it will work out.

00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:32.161
So, gradually it was all unfolded.

00:47:32.618 --> 00:47:35.554
And gradually people also developed

00:47:35.753 --> 00:47:38.153
their spiritual state to understand.

00:47:38.471 --> 00:47:42.604
Supposing, I had started Sahaja Yoga even hundred years back,

00:47:42.816 --> 00:47:47.283
I would not have even one single disciple, one single Sahaja Yogi.

00:47:47.519 --> 00:47:52.042
The reason was, the people were all right,
they were on value system, all right.

00:47:52.161 --> 00:47:56.040
Their life was very much satisfying, they were very peaceful.

00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:59.850
They were just interested in some horses or something like that.

00:47:59.989 --> 00:48:05.326
But now, you find people are so much disturbed,

00:48:05.505 --> 00:48:09.771
so much in trouble, so much in chaos this in Kali Yuga,

00:48:10.009 --> 00:48:14.017
it’s the height of Kali Yuga now. So much of immorality,

00:48:14.315 --> 00:48:18.302
so much of dissatisfaction in life

00:48:18.543 --> 00:48:22.769
that they have to now think where to go.

00:48:23.543 --> 00:48:27.392
Like a shock the future is waiting for them

00:48:27.579 --> 00:48:31.112
and now what should they achieve. So, the whole this

00:48:32.708 --> 00:48:40.815
Bhranti, illusion of life starts staring at them,

00:48:41.074 --> 00:48:44.823
and then they start thinking ” What is this, what am I doing,

00:48:45.021 --> 00:48:47.641
what have I done, why is it so?

00:48:47.939 --> 00:48:51.490
Why everything in a chaos, why is it happening? ”

00:48:52.066 --> 00:48:56.919
Then the seeking starts and with their seeking now,
you know what has happened,

00:48:57.057 --> 00:48:59.477
that you all have got your realization.

00:48:59.618 --> 00:49:04.399
Without the seeking it would not
have been even possible for Me to talk to you

00:49:04.577 --> 00:49:06.740
at all about Sahaja Yoga.

00:49:06.898 --> 00:49:09.577
It is because you are seekers I can talk to you.

00:49:09.716 --> 00:49:11.771
And it has worked out,

00:49:11.891 --> 00:49:15.225
I am very happy that it has worked out in America.

00:49:16.601 --> 00:49:21.700
Another quality, is a great quality of Shri Krishna, is that

00:49:21.978 --> 00:49:27.129
He is Gujara [HINDI ?], means

00:49:28.003 --> 00:49:31.951
His element is firmament, what we call Akash,

00:49:32.824 --> 00:49:35.959
and He penetrates into everything.

00:49:36.852 --> 00:49:44.000
He penetrates into everything. He penetrates into the

00:49:45.301 --> 00:49:51.778
– what do you call that – anu, renu, paramanu,

00:49:51.957 --> 00:50:01.619
three things – atoms. Into little atoms it goes and it shakes them.

00:50:02.215 --> 00:50:05.281
Now, if you ask any scientist, he’ll tell you

00:50:05.489 --> 00:50:12.067
that there is an asymetric, symetric vibrations even in atoms.

00:50:12.603 --> 00:50:17.010
Now, how can this energy be existing there?

00:50:17.229 --> 00:50:20.403
Because He can penetrate into anything

00:50:20.661 --> 00:50:24.629
and because of this, He’s so penetrating,

00:50:25.146 --> 00:50:29.312
that He encompasses everything:

00:50:29.749 --> 00:50:38.306
into matter, into animals, into human beings, into realized souls

00:50:38.790 --> 00:50:45.052
He penetrates. In the matter it is just a vibrations,

00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:48.456
in the animals it is just a guiding force,

00:50:48.612 --> 00:50:50.678
it’s tremendous guiding force.

00:50:56.445 --> 00:51:02.068
Like birds from Siberia flying down to Australia:

00:51:03.239 --> 00:51:05.839
who gives them the sense of direction?

00:51:06.493 --> 00:51:08.506
We never think about it.

00:51:11.443 --> 00:51:16.105
There are so many things animals are doing.

00:51:16.404 --> 00:51:19.796
They have such a sense of understanding.

00:51:20.074 --> 00:51:24.181
Like a tiger in the, say, in the forest:

00:51:24.618 --> 00:51:27.990
all the animals know that there is a tiger in the forest,

00:51:28.150 --> 00:51:31.016
they are all quiet, respecting their king.

00:51:31.591 --> 00:51:36.869
He kills, say one cow or could be some animal,

00:51:37.167 --> 00:51:42.801
they just respect him. The thing what he has killed is left

00:51:43.298 --> 00:51:46.154
for one day, nobody touches it.

00:51:46.849 --> 00:51:51.095
See the protocol: now when he comes back next day,

00:51:51.314 --> 00:51:53.750
he eats to his own satisfaction,

00:51:54.346 --> 00:51:57.479
then the tigress, then the children, they eat.

00:51:58.056 --> 00:52:04.048
Once they have finished with it,
then one by one, in the order of protocol,

00:52:04.525 --> 00:52:08.572
all the animals eat that animal,

00:52:09.068 --> 00:52:12.421
the last of all are crows

00:52:13.731 --> 00:52:18.163
which are perhaps vegetarians, I should say.

00:52:18.444 --> 00:52:24.671
But the protocol is maintained.

00:52:25.346 --> 00:52:31.119
If a lion is sitting,

00:52:31.616 --> 00:52:37.350
you can make it out there won’t be even a little sound anywhere.

00:52:39.991 --> 00:52:46.162
So, it guides the animals and animals keep their character.

00:52:47.132 --> 00:52:49.266
They are not like human beings.

00:52:49.426 --> 00:52:54.088
For example, a snake is a snake and a tiger is a tiger.

00:52:54.525 --> 00:52:58.096
But human beings can be snake, tiger, leopard

00:52:58.275 --> 00:52:59.882
– anything together.

00:53:01.073 --> 00:53:06.406
They might be dogs, they might be
small little worms, they could be anything.

00:53:07.323 --> 00:53:09.456
Combinations of so many things,

00:53:09.989 --> 00:53:14.048
because they have passed through
these Yonis, as they call them, these species.

00:53:14.664 --> 00:53:23.512
So, all these kinds of combinations, permutations,
combinations inside of the past is existing.

00:53:24.405 --> 00:53:29.138
And if somebody can take you to your subconscious,
I have seen this,

00:53:29.366 --> 00:53:31.566
people start barking like a dog,

00:53:32.263 --> 00:53:39.626
and sometimes they behave like tigers, this can happen.

00:53:40.321 --> 00:53:43.019
All this is within us, the past,

00:53:43.437 --> 00:53:47.285
with all these complicated personalities.

00:53:48.282 --> 00:53:55.849
Some are like owls, always very serious, you know, hawk-like,

00:53:56.246 --> 00:53:59.380
some are like chirping birds.

00:54:00.135 --> 00:54:03.735
But there are so many combinations they have in them,

00:54:04.579 --> 00:54:07.773
that it is very difficult, you know,

00:54:08.726 --> 00:54:12.839
to make them little straightforward.

00:54:14.566 --> 00:54:18.966
They are so much entangled. First to remove all the entanglement.

00:54:20.597 --> 00:54:23.287
And then to raise the Kundalini.

00:54:23.685 --> 00:54:27.218
The best part of the organization is, which is made,

00:54:28.645 --> 00:54:32.990
that consciousness is vertically placed.

00:54:33.466 --> 00:54:36.680
Subconscious and Supraconscious sort.

00:54:36.899 --> 00:54:39.432
Supraconscious righthandside of yours

00:54:39.617 --> 00:54:42.551
and the Subconscious lefthandside of yours.

00:54:44.389 --> 00:54:48.856
And in the central the path is left on. This is the Sushumna path.

00:54:49.667 --> 00:54:51.667
It is the Mahalakshmi’s path.

00:54:52.048 --> 00:54:57.556
It is the path, which leads you to the state of Virat,

00:54:57.778 --> 00:54:59.578
to the state of your brain.

00:55:03.152 --> 00:55:08.409
So now, the combination of three things work out.

00:55:09.124 --> 00:55:14.084
The brain is the Virat, heart is Shiva,

00:55:14.779 --> 00:55:19.953
and the liver is Brahmadeva.

00:55:20.371 --> 00:55:23.604
All these three powers are there.

00:55:28.406 --> 00:55:31.759
But at that time, when you are realized,

00:55:32.117 --> 00:55:36.541
then your brain surrenders to Shiva,

00:55:36.978 --> 00:55:40.987
to the principle of Shiva, that is the Spirit.

00:55:41.657 --> 00:55:47.158
Brain is surrendered, surrendered not by force or anything,

00:55:47.614 --> 00:55:52.785
but to absorb the power of the Spirit,

00:55:52.983 --> 00:55:57.646
the brain gets surrendered completely to the Spirit,

00:55:58.460 --> 00:56:01.193
so that the Spirit enlightens the brain.

00:56:02.686 --> 00:56:06.376
It is the enlightenment of the brain

00:56:07.130 --> 00:56:13.845
that gives you all this subtle understanding.

00:56:14.304 --> 00:56:18.269
It is to make your brain understand,

00:56:18.865 --> 00:56:24.043
there are so many blissful happenings, people are blessed:

00:56:24.381 --> 00:56:30.829
once, twice, thrice – then they are surprised,
the brain starts thinking.

00:56:31.285 --> 00:56:34.520
”How did I get this blessing, how did it happen to me,

00:56:34.699 --> 00:56:41.583
how could I get my transformation?” So slowly-slowly

00:56:41.862 --> 00:56:47.258
they start trusting their heart,
means they start trusting their Spirit,

00:56:47.457 --> 00:56:52.814
they start trusting their devotion.

00:56:54.560 --> 00:57:00.901
And this is how the bhakti is absolutely

00:57:01.437 --> 00:57:06.516
done without any desire, without any asking,

00:57:06.695 --> 00:57:10.246
without any obligation, just in oneness.

00:57:10.405 --> 00:57:16.734
Because the brain joins hands with the heart, we can say.

00:57:17.645 --> 00:57:24.192
Now, also the Brahmadeva becomes surrendered.

00:57:25.502 --> 00:57:31.704
As a result, what happens:
that your liver is surrendered to your brain.

00:57:35.215 --> 00:57:41.119
When this happens – when your liver is surrendered to your brain

00:57:41.359 --> 00:57:45.684
– whatever you do is all enlightened work.

00:57:46.636 --> 00:57:50.266
Whatever you do: whether you sing,

00:57:50.465 --> 00:57:53.658
whether you’re a government servant, whether anything

00:57:53.819 --> 00:57:57.151
– whatever you do with your brain, anything

00:57:57.290 --> 00:57:59.472
through the Swadishthana

00:57:59.651 --> 00:58:04.409
or through the Brahmadeva, it is an enlightened work.

00:58:17.856 --> 00:58:21.268
As it is the brain which is enlightened,

00:58:21.936 --> 00:58:25.269
which is connected with this All Pervading Power,

00:58:25.606 --> 00:58:31.737
whatever you are doing, whatever your ideas are,

00:58:32.174 --> 00:58:39.852
being absolutely enlightened means that you achieve them.

00:58:42.419 --> 00:58:46.268
Enlightened brain, whatever it thinks,

00:58:46.844 --> 00:58:51.284
it is thinking as well as achieving – both together.

00:58:53.192 --> 00:58:59.600
It’s a thing to be understood that an enlightened person

00:59:00.910 --> 00:59:05.570
has the power to achieve anything.

00:59:07.634 --> 00:59:12.188
But at the same time his desires would be Divine.

00:59:13.398 --> 00:59:17.961
Like the other day we had very few people say in Saritos,

00:59:18.617 --> 00:59:23.081
so all the Sahaja Yogis were extremely unhappy

00:59:23.696 --> 00:59:27.763
as if somebody has died in their family and worse than that.

00:59:28.994 --> 00:59:34.293
Why? Because this was their own work,

00:59:34.645 --> 00:59:41.852
which they could not understand why this enlightened mind of theirs

00:59:42.190 --> 00:59:45.590
could not produce the result, achieve the results.

00:59:47.448 --> 00:59:49.648
And they felt extremely unhappy.

00:59:50.107 --> 00:59:57.774
This shows what identification there is for the spiritual work,

00:59:58.290 --> 01:00:01.564
or Divine work and their own lives.

01:00:01.762 --> 01:00:04.162
To them this is the most important.

01:00:04.302 --> 01:00:07.040
And everybody is not like that, of course.

01:00:07.179 --> 01:00:10.314
For some people, something else is more important.

01:00:10.453 --> 01:00:15.413
They may use Sahaja Yoga for their own well-being or anything.

01:00:15.711 --> 01:00:18.378
But those who just think of Sahaja Yoga

01:00:19.736 --> 01:00:24.002
– that’s again the brain which is enlightened. They achieve it.

01:00:25.192 --> 01:00:28.725
But it should not have any selfish motive behind it.

01:00:29.121 --> 01:00:34.576
It should not have any hatred behind it or anything,

01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:40.273
or for some sort of a publicity or some.

01:00:41.543 --> 01:00:48.673
But if it is just the thinking about the Sahaja Yoga work,

01:00:48.814 --> 01:00:51.452
it will be achieved, it will be achieved.

01:00:51.611 --> 01:00:53.878
One should never feel frustrated.

01:00:54.270 --> 01:00:57.137
That’s what is said, that God is with you,

01:00:57.861 --> 01:00:59.706
He is your shepherd.

01:00:59.944 --> 01:01:04.389
And this is what happens when you become

01:01:05.004 --> 01:01:12.473
a surrendered lamb under the guide of this shepherd.

01:01:15.867 --> 01:01:22.711
Then as a result of this brain becoming enlightened,
you start having faith in yourself.

01:01:25.648 --> 01:01:28.448
Nirvikalpa, you become doubtlessly aware.

01:01:28.783 --> 01:01:32.716
As soon as you become, I mean the brain becomes doubtless.

01:01:32.843 --> 01:01:36.664
It’s the brain that thinks,
it’s the brain that doubts, it’s the brain

01:01:36.763 --> 01:01:40.697
that creates all conditionings, the brain that creates ego

01:01:41.565 --> 01:01:47.001
– one instrument doing all this nonsense. Hatred it will create,

01:01:47.140 --> 01:01:53.171
it will justify nonsense, it will criticize others,

01:01:53.509 --> 01:01:58.836
it will hate others, it will make fun of others.

01:02:00.364 --> 01:02:03.098
That is not the quality of Shri Krishna,

01:02:04.253 --> 01:02:07.189
because He is the collective.

01:02:10.781 --> 01:02:15.448
That’s why He never said: ” You are a sinner ”
or anything like that.

01:02:17.785 --> 01:02:20.718
He didn’t criticize anyone.

01:02:22.365 --> 01:02:27.146
After all, I have to criticize, He did not.

01:02:27.563 --> 01:02:31.297
Now, if there was Kamsa, all right, kill him, finished.

01:02:31.413 --> 01:02:33.213
There are Sanda, kill him.

01:02:33.734 --> 01:02:37.206
Any rakshasa, Narakasura, kill him,

01:02:37.623 --> 01:02:42.300
finished, no argument., nothing.
”I have no time for this nonsense. Finish him.”

01:02:43.114 --> 01:02:45.407
Straightforward.

01:02:46.181 --> 01:02:48.781
What is the use of criticizing anyone,

01:02:49.435 --> 01:02:55.367
just kill them. That was as straightforward.

01:02:55.824 --> 01:02:59.891
But by killing them, they again come back in this Kali Yuga.

01:03:02.729 --> 01:03:06.984
So the best thing is to detach people from him,

01:03:07.635 --> 01:03:11.171
from these rakshasas where they are lost.

01:03:11.489 --> 01:03:17.857
That’s the best way. Now,
one way could be that I put it in your brains

01:03:18.314 --> 01:03:24.723
that this is a rakshas. But they won’t believe Me, they won’t.

01:03:25.418 --> 01:03:28.575
So, what happens when you go to them,

01:03:28.833 --> 01:03:33.337
you get all the kinks in your head.

01:03:33.873 --> 01:03:37.540
You start getting pins and needles on your fingertips.

01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:42.483
This is all the activity of brain that it acts on your nerves,

01:03:42.761 --> 01:03:44.062
and you can feel it.

01:03:44.249 --> 01:03:49.321
You start shaking. The other day somebody came and sat before
Me for news just doing like this. ” What is this – Stop it! ”

01:03:49.479 --> 01:03:54.848
” So I can’t, I can’t, I can’t “, he was going on.
I wasn’t doing anything to him, it’s the brain.

01:03:56.417 --> 01:04:01.257
In My presence, the brain acts.

01:04:02.143 --> 01:04:05.609
Because as I told you, He penetrates into anything,

01:04:05.754 --> 01:04:07.820
if I put my glance at somebody.

01:04:09.424 --> 01:04:10.785
The other day,

01:04:10.964 --> 01:04:16.559
there was a boy, very naughty, beats people,
he bites them, these things like that, very crazy.

01:04:16.857 --> 01:04:18.924
As soon as he saw Me ran away.

01:04:19.913 --> 01:04:22.646
He attacks every person but he ran away.

01:04:23.106 --> 01:04:27.035
Then you have seen people who are possessed, what happens to them?

01:04:27.199 --> 01:04:30.199
Just like this, they come to Me, they shake,

01:04:30.379 --> 01:04:33.494
they – sometimes I only worry that they should not faint

01:04:33.655 --> 01:04:37.603
in My presence in the programme, otherwise it’s a headache.

01:04:38.893 --> 01:04:44.448
So, who acts in them, who acts on these people who are possessed,

01:04:44.665 --> 01:04:47.665
who makes all these gestures – is the brain.

01:04:48.773 --> 01:04:51.602
In the brain they have got

01:04:52.238 --> 01:04:55.505
these problems and Shri Krishna makes them shake.

01:04:57.692 --> 01:05:02.385
It’s the tremors that they feel,
the pins and needles that they feel,

01:05:02.525 --> 01:05:07.425
the heat that they feel – all this is central nervous system,

01:05:08.458 --> 01:05:09.925
run by brain.

01:05:10.878 --> 01:05:19.370
So, after enlightenment, what happens that the brain is at peace,

01:05:20.782 --> 01:05:23.618
absolutely at peace with itself.

01:05:24.232 --> 01:05:29.737
It doesn’t react as it used to react.

01:05:29.995 --> 01:05:35.344
Like I’ve seen people here so speedy, so nervous,

01:05:36.098 --> 01:05:39.650
so upset all the time, so jittery, irritable.

01:05:39.968 --> 01:05:43.015
I was reading the life of Mao and I was surprised:

01:05:43.194 --> 01:05:46.904
his physician, personal physician has said even.

01:05:47.122 --> 01:05:53.193
Absolutely like a tyrant and he
used to keep up the faces very well.

01:05:53.472 --> 01:05:59.344
But according to this doctor, he was a cruelest man he had known.

01:06:00.277 --> 01:06:01.666
This is Mao,

01:06:03.333 --> 01:06:09.666
who obviously looked to be a very great reformer,
he did so much for that country, this thing.

01:06:10.317 --> 01:06:14.464
But no, he was a hypocrite. How will you know

01:06:14.821 --> 01:06:18.650
somebody is a hypocrite or not – with your brain?

01:06:18.948 --> 01:06:20.815
Only if you are enlightened.

01:06:21.924 --> 01:06:26.329
So, if Shri Krishna penetrates into your brain,

01:06:26.607 --> 01:06:31.408
then you become an enlightened person, Sthitha Pragya,

01:06:31.627 --> 01:06:36.983
and you become knowledgeable, you know everything,

01:06:39.008 --> 01:06:41.003
whatever is necessary.

01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:47.114
You may not know who is number one Wimbledon, maybe.

01:06:48.127 --> 01:06:52.660
You may not know who is the actress, what is her life, you may not.

01:06:53.623 --> 01:06:58.356
You may not know who is the president
of such and such place, maybe.

01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:05.587
But you will know whatever is necessary for you to know.

01:07:06.261 --> 01:07:08.861
Otherwise people waste their energies.

01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:15.647
I know of somebody who knew the telephone numbers

01:07:16.362 --> 01:07:24.754
and the car numbers of two thousand people. What is the need?

01:07:27.473 --> 01:07:35.728
Something like that,
all these stupid things is a waste of mental energy.

01:07:36.338 --> 01:07:40.807
But a Sthitha Pragya does not, he is concentrated

01:07:41.205 --> 01:07:47.117
onto his own knowledge, onto the Divine understanding.

01:07:55.358 --> 01:08:05.896
He works really like a computer, and such an efficient computer.

01:08:09.151 --> 01:08:12.464
Today I just started talking about Kabira.

01:08:12.980 --> 01:08:15.914
Immediately they said ”Mother, vibrations!”

01:08:17.722 --> 01:08:20.789
Taking the name of Kabira you get vibrations.

01:08:23.328 --> 01:08:28.915
But to a normal person nothing, Kabira is nothing, another

01:08:29.134 --> 01:08:30.991
romantic fellow.

01:08:31.943 --> 01:08:36.410
If they don’t want to understand something, they can say anything.

01:08:38.729 --> 01:08:41.462
But only the people who are enlightened,

01:08:42.043 --> 01:08:46.129
their nervous system is so charged

01:08:47.678 --> 01:08:53.791
that they can feel what is wrong, what is right, they can feel

01:08:54.029 --> 01:08:57.045
the Divinity, they can make out

01:08:57.462 --> 01:09:01.509
who are incarnations and who were not.

01:09:03.950 --> 01:09:09.617
You don’t know what has happened to
your nervous system: a new dimension has come.

01:09:10.617 --> 01:09:15.280
Absolutely a new dimension in your nervous system has come,

01:09:15.479 --> 01:09:22.184
which is manifesting, and this is also
the blessings of Shri Krishna.

01:09:23.891 --> 01:09:27.958
Because He is collectiveness within us,

01:09:28.494 --> 01:09:33.653
in the form of collectivity He works.

01:09:41.826 --> 01:09:44.759
Unless and until this America is put right,

01:09:45.864 --> 01:09:52.153
Shri Krishna is not going to leave my throat, I tell you.

01:09:53.324 --> 01:10:03.066
So, as America, I say, is the
place of Shri Krishna’s auspiciousness.

01:10:07.343 --> 01:10:12.977
So, one has to understand what is Shri Krishna’s auspiciousness is.

01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:16.846
They said He had 16.000 wives,

01:10:18.136 --> 01:10:22.818
these were His powers, 16.000 powers He has.

01:10:24.069 --> 01:10:27.269
And to work out His incarnation He wanted them.

01:10:27.819 --> 01:10:34.343
So, they came on this earth as princesses
and was married by a horrible

01:10:34.482 --> 01:10:39.680
king who married them and kept them in the jail.

01:10:41.109 --> 01:10:45.909
So, He fought that king and got
them out of them and He married them.

01:10:48.054 --> 01:10:53.906
It’s the best part of it: He married them. Because, you see,

01:10:54.358 --> 01:10:57.358
with a man, whatever may be his age,

01:10:57.617 --> 01:11:01.148
if he has 16.000 women around him,

01:11:01.663 --> 01:11:05.532
people will never understand that he is Yogeshwara.

01:11:05.949 --> 01:11:09.869
Men have this problem. Not the women so much.

01:11:10.445 --> 01:11:16.445
Because women become mothers, you see,
I’m a Mother, nobody can challenge my character.

01:11:17.013 --> 01:11:21.893
Because I am a Mother. But the fatherhood can be challenged.

01:11:23.064 --> 01:11:24.397
So He married them.

01:11:24.890 --> 01:11:28.223
Then the essence of the five elements He married,

01:11:28.856 --> 01:11:30.502
as five wives.

01:11:33.261 --> 01:11:43.649
But His real sense of morality is seen in the case of Draupadi.

01:11:44.443 --> 01:11:46.777
You know the story of Mahabharata,

01:11:47.915 --> 01:11:53.074
when She was brought in the court of Duryodhana

01:11:53.709 --> 01:11:57.937
(who) asked Dushasana to take out Her saris.

01:12:00.537 --> 01:12:05.160
At that time Tulsidas’s written what happened.

01:12:05.577 --> 01:12:11.568
She was holding Her saree by Her teeth.

01:12:12.804 --> 01:12:16.204
She called ” Krishna “, She could only say ” Kri “,

01:12:16.330 --> 01:12:19.218
‘shna’ means full stop, goes wrong.

01:12:19.358 --> 01:12:23.292
She is holding on with only ‘Kri’, and wouldn’t say ‘shna’.

01:12:23.743 --> 01:12:28.953
But as soon as She said ” Krishna “, the saree fell down.

01:12:29.447 --> 01:12:31.046
Then He describes:

01:12:31.246 --> 01:12:34.777
“Dwarika yashoda jayo yashoda bhayo bari

01:12:34.936 --> 01:12:38.963
shankha chakra gada padma garuda laisi dhary.”

01:12:39.107 --> 01:12:41.047
[Unsure. In Shri Krishna Gitavali of Tulsidas ]

01:12:41.227 --> 01:12:42.508
What did He do?

01:12:42.786 --> 01:12:50.405
When She just said “Krishna”, there was a big sound in Dwarika,

01:12:50.623 --> 01:12:52.349
He was in Dwarika.

01:12:55.544 --> 01:12:57.401
Immediately,

01:12:57.897 --> 01:13:03.512
with “shanka, chakra, gada, padma” – these are His four weapons

01:13:04.326 --> 01:13:05.993
– He came on the Garuda.

01:13:07.956 --> 01:13:14.119
The way it is said is tremendous,
I mean, I feel really, it fulfils your heart with such

01:13:14.457 --> 01:13:20.369
understanding of Shri Krishna. For his own sister,

01:13:20.806 --> 01:13:25.964
He came all the way to save Her chastity.

01:13:26.659 --> 01:13:32.717
To Him the chastity of His sister was of the greatest importance.

01:13:32.836 --> 01:13:35.387
He could have said: ” No, no, no,

01:13:35.507 --> 01:13:41.040
I am a king, I have to look after this,
I have to do that, I have to ” – nothing.

01:13:41.228 --> 01:13:43.680
If Her chastity is in danger,

01:13:43.839 --> 01:13:48.124
He came flying on the Garuda and supplied that.

01:13:48.700 --> 01:13:50.835
And this fellow got tired

01:13:50.955 --> 01:13:53.852
pulling out Her saris. I think, he must have borrowed saris from Me

01:13:54.011 --> 01:13:57.423
because I have too many saris.

01:13:57.998 --> 01:14:00.798
One after the other, one after the other,

01:14:00.915 --> 01:14:03.715
he made a pile of saris and he got tired.

01:14:03.812 --> 01:14:05.679
He could not make Her nude.

01:14:07.602 --> 01:14:13.366
The chastity of Draupadi was of such a height.

01:14:14.044 --> 01:14:20.628
And how Shri Krishna tried to save it is remarkable.

01:14:24.577 --> 01:14:32.394
So, this Yogeshwara Shri Krishna is also a Dhanvantari,

01:14:32.613 --> 01:14:37.064
means the doctor of doctors.

01:14:37.898 --> 01:14:41.965
He is the One who cures. You see, because it’s all the brain

01:14:43.176 --> 01:14:46.842
– and the vibrations which flow on the nervous system.

01:14:48.751 --> 01:14:55.616
So, He cures people through His brain.

01:14:58.163 --> 01:15:06.672
Now, how? Say now, supposing somebody is having a problem, say

01:15:07.442 --> 01:15:14.470
on his heart. So as soon as he puts hands to My photograph,

01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:23.438
so immediately he gets problem on his left finger here.

01:15:23.974 --> 01:15:26.037
The brain is working.

01:15:26.732 --> 01:15:33.728
So in your brain, My vibrations go of Shri Krishna

01:15:35.316 --> 01:15:40.752
and they start sending these messages.

01:15:41.546 --> 01:15:43.680
Because I am also Shri Krishna.

01:15:43.938 --> 01:15:46.914
So this computer acts and immediately

01:15:47.034 --> 01:15:51.368
you know what’s wrong with that person is, he is a heart patient.

01:15:53.820 --> 01:15:57.205
You don’t have to do any diagnosis, you don’t have to do anything.

01:15:57.514 --> 01:16:00.826
Immediately you know. And who does this, it’s the

01:16:00.967 --> 01:16:04.434
principle of Shri Krishna in the brain of the Virat.

01:16:05.934 --> 01:16:10.693
See this, also working for some people, I think.

01:16:10.931 --> 01:16:14.250
Now you are convinced about it, you know that it

01:16:14.371 --> 01:16:17.505
works, it acts like this, it happens like that,

01:16:19.677 --> 01:16:23.967
and how it communicates through you.

01:16:24.305 --> 01:16:30.072
So, this computer of Mine communicates.

01:16:30.321 --> 01:16:32.575
Now, in a computer if you go,

01:16:32.716 --> 01:16:35.647
you can just press the button, of course they are all man-made,

01:16:35.767 --> 01:16:38.700
but whatever it is you then get the result.

01:16:38.802 --> 01:16:47.831
Here it is not like that. It is the
brain automatically gives the result,

01:16:47.988 --> 01:16:51.738
immediately, through the other person.

01:16:54.776 --> 01:16:59.874
And also the same brain tells you what is to be done

01:17:00.053 --> 01:17:03.053
to such and such person, how to work it out.

01:17:03.962 --> 01:17:07.315
The same brain is emitting vibrations,

01:17:08.288 --> 01:17:13.436
and those vibrations are flowing through this brain,

01:17:15.461 --> 01:17:21.353
and they are the ones who tell you what’s wrong with this person.

01:17:25.381 --> 01:17:32.620
So, all this work of penetration is done by Shri Krishna, no doubt.

01:17:35.339 --> 01:17:39.750
He takes these vibrations, puts into another brain,

01:17:39.909 --> 01:17:43.897
and then that brain, that central nervous system starts working

01:17:44.037 --> 01:17:47.370
and then you get the result. But instantaneously,

01:17:48.460 --> 01:17:52.727
it’s not so much time it takes, another way I have described it,

01:17:52.892 --> 01:17:54.695
it just works immediately.

01:17:54.835 --> 01:17:58.501
As soon as they put their hands before Me, immediately!

01:18:02.568 --> 01:18:09.101
So how important it is for us to look after our brain,
for Sahaja Yogis.

01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:17.099
I don’t know in this America how far this brain is safe.

01:18:17.516 --> 01:18:21.583
Because if you open any television, wah wah wah,

01:18:22.457 --> 01:18:25.155
you look outside on the street,

01:18:25.651 --> 01:18:29.063
look out for the – some advertisements

01:18:29.441 --> 01:18:31.663
and you hear this music

01:18:32.814 --> 01:18:35.147
– it breaks your brain completely.

01:18:37.436 --> 01:18:43.050
Whole atmosphere is anti-Shri Krishna.

01:18:46.722 --> 01:18:54.836
No purity of understanding, no sense of morality.

01:18:55.710 --> 01:19:01.142
The way they make pictures, things, horrible violence, horrible,

01:19:02.413 --> 01:19:05.746
I should say, immoral scenes, all sorts of things

01:19:06.341 --> 01:19:10.349
– all created here in the land of Shri Krishna.

01:19:11.718 --> 01:19:21.816
The One who through His waves can completely purify,

01:19:22.010 --> 01:19:29.316
because He’s Yogeshwara, because He is detached,

01:19:30.587 --> 01:19:35.408
absolutely detached, He cannot get attached to anything.

01:19:37.050 --> 01:19:39.383
Only the brain makes you attached.

01:19:40.006 --> 01:19:42.673
Now see, supposing this carpet is here.

01:19:43.704 --> 01:19:45.371
This is a saree, is here.

01:19:46.029 --> 01:19:49.629
I look at the saree, and what a nice is this one now.

01:19:50.165 --> 01:19:54.032
Now, if it is mine, I’m worried it should not get spoiled

01:19:55.860 --> 01:20:00.184
and where it will be kept, what will happen to it.

01:20:01.375 --> 01:20:10.514
Goes on worrying about things. Here is any

01:20:10.752 --> 01:20:16.152
more road you walk, there are
shops, shops, shops, shops, shops, shops, shops.

01:20:17.201 --> 01:20:23.184
– Attention goes there, and in that attention

01:20:23.423 --> 01:20:26.855
this brain gets involved completely.

01:20:27.867 --> 01:20:36.359
It gets involved, it wants this, and wants that,
and wants that, and wants that -for what?

01:20:37.649 --> 01:20:41.533
So, the detachment from the matter is only possible

01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:44.840
if you know generosity.

01:20:49.013 --> 01:20:53.279
But many people are in Sahaja Yoga, but they are not.

01:20:53.875 --> 01:20:56.037
What is generosity now?

01:20:57.644 --> 01:21:01.378
Generosity is now if you like My saree, you’ll have it.

01:21:02.964 --> 01:21:04.831
That’s the real generosity.

01:21:07.581 --> 01:21:13.054
Whatever I am buying is for you, supposing. So you have it.

01:21:14.761 --> 01:21:19.105
If you have a generous detached temperament,

01:21:19.939 --> 01:21:22.939
then you can never get involved with matter.

01:21:24.324 --> 01:21:27.676
And whatever you are involved, it is love.

01:21:28.351 --> 01:21:32.239
Say, I went to Russia,

01:21:33.807 --> 01:21:41.168
and there was nice fish eggs they call as caviar.

01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:45.574
There’s one doctor who likes it very much in London.

01:21:45.791 --> 01:21:48.324
I said: ” Please, let Me have some “.

01:21:48.489 --> 01:21:52.055
They said: ” Why do you want to take this one? ” ” I want to “.

01:21:52.214 --> 01:21:54.674
They thought of the doctor who needed it there

01:21:54.813 --> 01:21:58.047
who likes it very much and I felt very happy about that.

01:21:58.166 --> 01:22:00.190
And the doctor also was very happy:

01:22:00.329 --> 01:22:04.062
” Mother, you remember even such small thing like this?

01:22:07.102 --> 01:22:13.233
So, the matter has a sense of giving
very great joy to another person.

01:22:15.289 --> 01:22:19.222
If you do it with love, again, I say: ” Do it with love “,

01:22:20.110 --> 01:22:26.757
not with attachment, but with love which is detached.

01:22:28.602 --> 01:22:36.868
He’s the One who is detached.

01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:45.796
So, what is the love that is detached, I’ve told many a times:

01:22:46.029 --> 01:22:51.834
Like the sap in the tree rises, goes to every part of the tree

01:22:53.521 --> 01:22:55.721
and is not attached to any part.

01:22:57.727 --> 01:23:00.524
And if it gets attached,

01:23:01.796 --> 01:23:06.529
then the tree will die, and that fruit,
whatever it is, will die also.

01:23:08.084 --> 01:23:11.000
So, what is it a detached love is?

01:23:11.973 --> 01:23:14.840
Detached love is the most beautiful thing.

01:23:16.854 --> 01:23:22.352
Firstly, by detached love you know what to give to whom,

01:23:23.722 --> 01:23:29.297
what will make people happy, what will make them joyous,

01:23:29.714 --> 01:23:31.729
what do they like.

01:23:32.186 --> 01:23:35.718
– In love only you know these things, – what do they like,

01:23:35.876 --> 01:23:44.309
what is their colour, style, what they want. Little, little things.

01:23:46.135 --> 01:23:49.335
As I told you yesterday the story of Shri Rama,

01:23:50.738 --> 01:23:57.564
whatever is done with love, even a little thing that you know

01:23:58.418 --> 01:24:02.351
you would like, I would like to purchase, may look stupid.

01:24:02.803 --> 01:24:05.603
But I know you like it, so I’ll buy that.

01:24:07.267 --> 01:24:09.601
In the same way, you also do that.

01:24:11.035 --> 01:24:14.838
All the time you think ” Mother, what will She like?”

01:24:14.958 --> 01:24:18.024
So, you look for little things here and there.

01:24:20.518 --> 01:24:25.073
But this detachment has to be full and complete.

01:24:26.125 --> 01:24:30.992
Then only you really get people attached to you,
otherwise you cannot.

01:24:31.304 --> 01:24:35.237
If you are not detached, you cannot get

01:24:36.375 --> 01:24:39.371
that complete love for another person.

01:24:39.649 --> 01:24:43.688
Because if you are doing something, say, for money,

01:24:45.812 --> 01:24:48.478
or if you are doing something for lust,

01:24:49.562 --> 01:24:55.236
or for greed, or for some sort of a position, it has no meaning.

01:24:56.248 --> 01:25:01.181
People know
”Oh, I know why he is doing it, because I am such and such“.

01:25:03.105 --> 01:25:07.728
In Sahaja Yoga also many people come either to make money,

01:25:08.006 --> 01:25:10.806
either to get cured, all kinds of things.

01:25:12.927 --> 01:25:15.208
But if you are detached,

01:25:17.252 --> 01:25:20.645
then only Sahaja Yoga will spread.

01:25:22.431 --> 01:25:28.298
As long as there are attachments,
you should know that you are not yet a Sahaja Yogi.

01:25:29.217 --> 01:25:35.617
I am not saying ”You take out your eye or cut your hands”
I didn’t say that, to that extent.

01:25:36.479 --> 01:25:40.229
What I’m saying: you should introspect and see:

01:25:40.685 --> 01:25:44.233
”How much am I attached to this or to that,

01:25:44.432 --> 01:25:49.948
and why am I so much attached, what does it matter?”

01:25:50.384 --> 01:25:52.650
Always, as a result of attachment

01:25:52.864 --> 01:25:55.197
you’ll always find disappointments.

01:25:55.365 --> 01:26:00.698
I’ve seen parents who have doted on
their child, loved their child, this, that.

01:26:01.079 --> 01:26:04.749
Children mostly go astray.

01:26:07.490 --> 01:26:10.690
But if you have a detached love for your child,

01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:15.319
you do nice things for the child.

01:26:15.495 --> 01:26:22.295
At the same time, you know when to say ‘no’,
when it is not good. ” This I don’t like, don’t do it “,

01:26:22.780 --> 01:26:24.895
you must say that.

01:26:28.446 --> 01:26:31.799
But detachment is even wider than that.

01:26:33.843 --> 01:26:37.553
Like some people are very fond of food.

01:26:39.391 --> 01:26:40.391
So,

01:26:42.506 --> 01:26:46.533
to say that you be detached from food is very difficult for them.

01:26:47.128 --> 01:26:51.644
Specially, at a certain age, I think, they are very fond of good

01:26:52.082 --> 01:26:56.914
food and all that. Gandhiji has talked about Aswad:

01:26:57.252 --> 01:26:59.319
you should not have any taste.

01:26:59.891 --> 01:27:04.958
But as you grow in Sahaja Yoga,
you’ll find automatically it will happen.

01:27:06.558 --> 01:27:09.691
All your fascination about food will drop out.

01:27:11.101 --> 01:27:15.501
That is another sign that you are absolutely detached about food.

01:27:15.916 --> 01:27:20.716
Now, today I had My lunch,
I don’t know whether it is dinner or lunch,

01:27:20.917 --> 01:27:23.039
’cause I had it at about five o’clock,

01:27:23.195 --> 01:27:26.129
so I don’t know wich part of the day it is.

01:27:26.274 --> 01:27:29.874
And if I don’t eat, it also makes no difference to Me,

01:27:31.274 --> 01:27:34.885
it doesn’t make Me weak or in any way unhappy.

01:27:37.599 --> 01:27:43.305
But thinking about food is just spoiling your brain.

01:27:44.261 --> 01:27:46.595
Many people just think about food.

01:27:46.777 --> 01:27:50.468
We went to their house: ” Oh, they had made such nice things.

01:27:50.568 --> 01:27:53.285
“We went to this house ” They’ve made such nice things.”

01:27:53.445 --> 01:27:57.293
What’s the use? You already have eaten, finished, now, done.

01:27:57.413 --> 01:27:59.946
Now, why are you thinking about that?

01:28:00.816 --> 01:28:05.549
Or: ” I went to somebody’s house,
they had given me a horrible food.

01:28:06.054 --> 01:28:09.387
” Why to think of food, I still don’t understand.

01:28:09.968 --> 01:28:12.368
Whatever has happened has happened.

01:28:12.531 --> 01:28:16.464
By thinking you cannot get back what you have been eating,

01:28:16.643 --> 01:28:18.643
or what you are going to eat.

01:28:18.766 --> 01:28:22.893
It’s there, whatever is there you have to eat, you see,
what can you do?

01:28:23.033 --> 01:28:27.417
For example, today, they asked Me:
”Mother, will you have hot dog?"

01:28:27.557 --> 01:28:31.895
In Hindi language it means real hot dog – means:

01:28:32.054 --> 01:28:35.169
garam kupte – they call that.

01:28:36.935 --> 01:28:39.335
I said ” All right, I’ll have it “.

01:28:39.495 --> 01:28:44.895
They said ” All the Americans eat. ”
” All right, I am an american, give Me “.

01:28:46.023 --> 01:28:51.163
But when you know something will not
do good for your teeth or something, you should not eat.

01:28:51.580 --> 01:28:55.132
For example, the beef is very bad for the teeth, very bad.

01:28:55.327 --> 01:28:58.097
That’s why you people loose your teeth very fast.

01:28:58.236 --> 01:29:03.545
Many people ask Me in the interview ”
Are your denture your own? ” I said: ” Of course, Mine “.

01:29:04.816 --> 01:29:06.816
They can’t believe it’s Mine.

01:29:07.911 --> 01:29:11.378
Because I know what not to eat for the teeth’s sake.

01:29:13.903 --> 01:29:17.137
But one should not be attached to an idea,

01:29:17.652 --> 01:29:19.965
that’s even subtler attachments.

01:29:20.105 --> 01:29:23.668
That has really killed this world with so many problems of

01:29:23.788 --> 01:29:27.291
fanaticism, racialism, I don’t know what.

01:29:28.795 --> 01:29:31.929
Now, here, see the contradictions people have:

01:29:32.213 --> 01:29:36.146
they go to the sea to get darker, and they have racialism.

01:29:37.411 --> 01:29:39.534
Why do you go to the sea?

01:29:39.950 --> 01:29:42.558
If you go to become darker,

01:29:42.699 --> 01:29:45.699
then why do you hate the people who are dark?

01:29:47.064 --> 01:29:51.758
Such a contradiction because the brain is not in balance.

01:29:52.213 --> 01:29:55.348
And for that you have racialism,

01:29:57.492 --> 01:29:58.960
you become racist.

01:29:59.933 --> 01:30:04.496
If not that, you have another conditioning that

01:30:04.675 --> 01:30:10.008
there are different casts and according to the cast,
you should go, in India.

01:30:10.848 --> 01:30:15.781
How can there be any cast when everybody
has the Spirit in their heart.

01:30:16.855 --> 01:30:21.922
They won’t eat from another lower cast,
they are higher cast, this, that.

01:30:22.986 --> 01:30:27.708
This brain is the one which creates all kinds of conditionings,

01:30:27.997 --> 01:30:31.529
and all those great Saints who have lived on this earth,

01:30:31.629 --> 01:30:34.565
wether they were in India or abroad or anywhere,

01:30:34.764 --> 01:30:39.565
all of them have stood against this nonsense of discrimination.

01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:43.552
That comes from brain, you know, ask them

01:30:43.692 --> 01:30:47.918
” Why do you think like that, you are higher than others? ”

01:30:48.116 --> 01:30:50.974
Like the germans think they are the highest race.

01:30:51.121 --> 01:30:53.593
Now, who will believe that bull story, I don’t know?

01:30:53.712 --> 01:30:55.934
It is absolutely nonsensical story:

01:30:56.054 --> 01:31:01.085
germans, the ones who have killed children in the gas chamber

01:31:01.225 --> 01:31:06.224
and enjoyed that, they must be the lowest race ever going!

01:31:08.407 --> 01:31:12.990
But they think they are the highest race! How can they be?

01:31:13.584 --> 01:31:16.671
Tomorrow, Rwanda people will say: ” We are the highest race,

01:31:16.792 --> 01:31:20.258
because we can kill each other nicely in the open. ”

01:31:23.479 --> 01:31:27.545
So, to think yourself to be higher than others,

01:31:27.705 --> 01:31:33.081
to think that you’re more beautiful than others, others are ugly

01:31:34.014 --> 01:31:40.059
– all this is the brain which takes you to ego,

01:31:41.667 --> 01:31:45.933
and the ego is the one who befools you completely all the time.

01:31:47.460 --> 01:31:49.527
That’s the job of Shri Krishna.

01:31:50.635 --> 01:31:53.502
The story you must have heard about Narada

01:31:53.631 --> 01:31:57.412
who never wanted to see, who thought he was a great man

01:31:57.528 --> 01:32:02.060
because he was never attracted to a woman,
and he was challenging even Shiva.

01:32:03.747 --> 01:32:08.080
Then Shri Krishna played a trick on him, He always plays tricks.

01:32:08.251 --> 01:32:13.886
He sent two Gandharvas to tease him.

01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:17.640
They went down and they asked Narada. They said

01:32:17.795 --> 01:32:21.177
” You are such a beautiful man, such a handsome person,

01:32:21.317 --> 01:32:24.907
there is a marriage going on of a lady [Rupoghadi, UNCLEAR]

01:32:25.062 --> 01:32:27.304
she is very beautiful, she is a princess

01:32:27.424 --> 01:32:30.836
and why don’t you go there, she’ll definitely marry you.

01:32:30.975 --> 01:32:35.975
” And they pampered his ego, you see,
such a lot, he started floating in the air.

01:32:36.134 --> 01:32:40.538
And he said ”All right, I am going to go there, I am so handsome.”

01:32:40.757 --> 01:32:47.573
Ego. He went there, and this princess came out with a garland.

01:32:47.751 --> 01:32:51.858
She looked at him and she giggled first and then she laughed aloud

01:32:52.062 --> 01:32:53.662
and then she went away.

01:32:54.577 --> 01:32:57.414
He couldn’t understand, looked at these two persons,

01:32:57.672 --> 01:33:03.049
they said ”It’s all right, now, it doesn’t matter,
maybe somebody is better looking, then you.”

01:33:03.565 --> 01:33:07.870
So, Narada was very angry, he went to the lake.

01:33:08.330 --> 01:33:12.196
When he looked into the lake, his face was like a monkey.

01:33:14.550 --> 01:33:19.172
He’s become a monkey because this ego makes you a monkey.

01:33:20.299 --> 01:33:25.923
And you start thinking: ah, you are great,
you are very beautiful, you are this thing, that thing…

01:33:26.063 --> 01:33:27.129
But you are not.

01:33:28.444 --> 01:33:30.910
Because if you are, you won’t think.

01:33:32.469 --> 01:33:39.269
Whatever you are, you don’t think about it. You don’t think:
”I am a human being“, do you say that?

01:33:39.413 --> 01:33:43.557
Or do you say ” I have no tails “, do you boast of that?

01:33:43.954 --> 01:33:47.478
Whatever you are not, then you boast: ” I am very beautiful,

01:33:47.677 --> 01:33:51.030
I am very good looking, others are ugly, this thing “.

01:33:51.149 --> 01:33:55.692
Then Shri Krishna plays a part through the Maya,

01:33:56.923 --> 01:34:00.456
and He gives a big lesson to that person.

01:34:02.828 --> 01:34:03.828
It happens.

01:34:04.653 --> 01:34:08.482
So, never think that you are something great,

01:34:08.820 --> 01:34:12.886
or you have achieved this in life and achieved that in life,

01:34:14.832 --> 01:34:19.038
and that you are something a big Johnny.

01:34:19.692 --> 01:34:26.192
Nothing, it’s nothing but the ego that has moved on here

01:34:27.204 --> 01:34:30.004
and giving you these ideas, from the ego.

01:34:30.776 --> 01:34:33.176
And if you go even further with it,

01:34:33.315 --> 01:34:40.001
then Hitler may enter into your ego and you might behave like him.

01:34:40.478 --> 01:34:46.135
Or if you are conditioned, impossible to tell you anything.

01:34:46.413 --> 01:34:51.155
Like this Hari Rama fellow I told you
”Why do you wear dhoti in this cold weather?”

01:34:51.294 --> 01:34:54.341
He said ” My guru has told me to wear dhoti “.

01:34:54.508 --> 01:34:56.603
”So what sort of a guru is it,

01:34:56.722 --> 01:34:59.044
that he makes you feel cold. I mean, I am a Mother,

01:34:59.228 --> 01:35:01.190
I don’t like all this nonsense.”

01:35:01.306 --> 01:35:03.786
He said ” No, but my guru has said “.

01:35:04.739 --> 01:35:08.369
What a conditioning! And conditioning

01:35:08.595 --> 01:35:13.547
for something which is absolutely absurd and ridiculous.

01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:19.360
Now see, Americans are most vulnerable to such a thing.

01:35:20.899 --> 01:35:23.092
You start any nonsense,

01:35:23.223 --> 01:35:26.670
immediately the Americans are the first to jump on it, immediately.

01:35:26.809 --> 01:35:32.781
Drugs you start, you start some sort of a,

01:35:33.628 --> 01:35:37.225
I can say, fancy dress.

01:35:37.940 --> 01:35:41.407
It will start in Paris but will be sold in America.

01:35:42.385 --> 01:35:46.185
Immediately. There are on the look-out of something new.

01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:49.907
It might be a monkey trick, but they will do it.

01:35:50.549 --> 01:35:56.818
I don’t know why Americans who are the residents of

01:35:56.978 --> 01:36:02.433
Shri Krishna’s land have no discretion at all,

01:36:03.446 --> 01:36:05.846
what to accept, what not to accept.

01:36:06.838 --> 01:36:10.778
They are the worst, they are worse than children even,

01:36:10.895 --> 01:36:14.985
there is no maturity of any kind: ” What’s wrong? ”

01:36:18.755 --> 01:36:24.401
So, the discretion which is the center we have here of Hamsa

01:36:24.779 --> 01:36:32.814
which is ruled by Vishuddhi, is completely sometimes blocked.

01:36:34.084 --> 01:36:38.826
Like one lady who came to America told Me very boastfully: ”

01:36:40.339 --> 01:36:43.942
Have you been to the pubs in England? ” I said ” No.

01:36:45.133 --> 01:36:50.093
Why? ” ” Oh, my God, what pubs you have here! You know,

01:36:50.311 --> 01:36:53.177
I went to the best ” I said ” Which one? ”

01:36:53.308 --> 01:36:56.879
“It’s known as Hermit’s pub ”

01:36:57.137 --> 01:37:02.117
” What is so special? ” Very high class lady, very high class

01:37:02.643 --> 01:37:05.658
– she says: ” You see, one man died,

01:37:05.837 --> 01:37:07.960
for one month nobody lifted the body,

01:37:08.079 --> 01:37:10.946
the whole thing was filled with the stink.

01:37:11.234 --> 01:37:12.967
So the stink is preserved

01:37:13.396 --> 01:37:16.571
and even the cowwebs are preserved as they are there.

01:37:16.790 --> 01:37:19.527
Such a great thing was this: in,

01:37:19.706 --> 01:37:24.706
when I went, and really I felt so spiritual there?

01:37:28.484 --> 01:37:32.000
” Then she started boasting ” You see, we are free people.

01:37:32.219 --> 01:37:37.020
I allow my children to drink. I give them drinks.

01:37:39.163 --> 01:37:43.630
” I said: ” Really? ” ” Yeah, I can give them any alcohol, anyone.

01:37:43.786 --> 01:37:47.357
I do not say ‘not this, not that’ – no, they can have “.

01:37:47.536 --> 01:37:51.670
The children who were hardly twelve and forteen years of age.

01:37:52.655 --> 01:37:56.977
I said ” All right, if you have been doing that,

01:37:57.434 --> 01:37:59.967
what can I say? You are a great lady,

01:38:00.132 --> 01:38:05.932
I would not do to my children or to my grandchildren,
but you are great, namaskar “.

01:38:06.283 --> 01:38:08.616
After three, four months, we heard

01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:12.374
that there was a birthday party of the younger boy

01:38:12.528 --> 01:38:17.116
and she had given all these alcohols to them for the friends.

01:38:18.679 --> 01:38:21.533
God knows what happened – they had candles and this and that

01:38:21.712 --> 01:38:28.835
– the whole house got burnt and all the children, her sons

01:38:29.093 --> 01:38:33.458
and these two sleeping upstairs, all got burnt and died.

01:38:38.677 --> 01:38:41.097
Boasting about nonsense,

01:38:42.050 --> 01:38:46.702
like: ” I have had five hundred men with me “.

01:38:47.516 --> 01:38:50.450
Another will say: ” I have so many women. ”

01:38:50.671 --> 01:38:57.357
I mean, you are stupid fools because you are organizing

01:38:57.735 --> 01:39:02.179
nice way to go to hell, and you are all going to go to hell,

01:39:02.536 --> 01:39:07.496
this is what it is to be told to them. If you go on like this,

01:39:07.754 --> 01:39:09.421
what will happen to you?

01:39:09.828 --> 01:39:13.028
Accumulating everything that will destroy them,

01:39:13.658 --> 01:39:18.391
doing everything that will destroy.
” Oh that’s good!” I said ” Why? ”

01:39:18.677 --> 01:39:25.423
” You know, if you take that, then in two minutes you go off. ”

01:39:25.602 --> 01:39:28.335
I said: ” To where? To hell, or where? “.

01:39:30.106 --> 01:39:35.373
Anything that is destructive,
I don’t know why the Americans should accept it,

01:39:35.513 --> 01:39:39.044
when they have Shri Krisna as their Lord.

01:39:42.596 --> 01:39:45.596
It is to be understood by Sahaja Yogis also,

01:39:46.128 --> 01:39:50.473
that you have to really transform
you have to serve to such an extent

01:39:50.632 --> 01:39:54.632
that what it is, whatever is destructive should be given up.

01:39:57.772 --> 01:39:59.271
First of all,

01:39:59.528 --> 01:40:03.395
I find some men and ladies with such long faces, you know.

01:40:05.450 --> 01:40:10.303
How can you be? You are living in the country of Leeladhara.

01:40:11.236 --> 01:40:13.903
He is the One who made everybody dance,

01:40:14.589 --> 01:40:19.906
and He is the One who sprayed Ras, Ra is energy, Dha is with

01:40:20.780 --> 01:40:25.176
– Ra-Dha. Ra is energy, the One who sustains energy.

01:40:25.593 --> 01:40:32.557
The One who did the mental energy enlightened and to sustain it,

01:40:32.875 --> 01:40:37.408
how can you people take to adharma,

01:40:37.746 --> 01:40:41.679
to immorality, and to destruction, I just can’t understand.

01:40:47.716 --> 01:40:52.002
I don’t know what are His plans are, very well,

01:40:52.648 --> 01:40:57.648
but He has to really save people of America from

01:40:57.788 --> 01:41:01.433
all kinds of nonsense they do morning till evening.

01:41:03.259 --> 01:41:07.326
There’s nobody who is sensible in the politics,

01:41:08.041 --> 01:41:13.536
nobody who has a good character at a very high positions,

01:41:13.728 --> 01:41:17.584
what sort of things! You cannot get one man

01:41:17.795 --> 01:41:22.528
whom you can say he is all right
and he will do good to your nation.

01:41:24.768 --> 01:41:27.368
Criticizing others, they are very good.

01:41:27.565 --> 01:41:30.565
Like we had this plague, this thing not much

01:41:30.701 --> 01:41:35.938
– this little bit came out,
they have published it all over these media,

01:41:36.355 --> 01:41:41.335
they’ve stopped all our ships,
stopped all our aeroplanes, made such a fuss,

01:41:41.474 --> 01:41:44.745
put us into so much trouble – what about your AIDS,

01:41:44.884 --> 01:41:47.551
which you are giving Prasad everywhere.

01:41:50.638 --> 01:41:57.383
It’s very surprising that with your brain
enlightened by Shri Krishna,

01:41:57.880 --> 01:42:01.590
how could people accept even mentally

01:42:01.947 --> 01:42:06.048
– person like Freud. How could you accept Freud?

01:42:06.446 --> 01:42:08.112
I just can’t understand.

01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:13.067
And now you are all ruined. So, now we are worried.

01:42:13.290 --> 01:42:16.028
They don’t what to do. Now they are breaking families,

01:42:16.148 --> 01:42:21.615
and all the logical conclusions
they reach is just the opposite of Shri Krishna.

01:42:21.853 --> 01:42:23.590
Like this Simpson killed his wife.

01:42:23.691 --> 01:42:26.567
All right, he killed, finished, this Simpson business.

01:42:26.755 --> 01:42:31.171
Now they are coming out big theories, see now: why psychologically

01:42:31.311 --> 01:42:34.111
he killed, because he was married to her.

01:42:34.465 --> 01:42:38.036
When you marry only you kill your wife or your husband.

01:42:38.216 --> 01:42:41.349
– So, you should not marry: what a conclusion!

01:42:42.064 --> 01:42:45.646
Tomorrow they’ll say that people are killing each other,

01:42:45.795 --> 01:42:48.604
so allow them to have weapons in their hand.

01:42:48.704 --> 01:42:52.304
Now, they want to allow them to have some drugs also.

01:42:53.485 --> 01:42:57.685
Allow them to have homosexuality, allow them to have all this.

01:42:58.565 --> 01:43:03.068
Because, I think, these people in charge of affairs

01:43:03.326 --> 01:43:07.064
do not want anybody to live,

01:43:08.194 --> 01:43:11.008
think that ” Let them fight among themselves, do what they like,

01:43:11.130 --> 01:43:13.055
we should have our own seats. ”

01:43:13.211 --> 01:43:16.833
The way they are not worried about the immorality

01:43:17.013 --> 01:43:23.659
and all the destructive forces
that are acting on American children,

01:43:24.235 --> 01:43:30.544
american youth and american people, not bothered about them.

01:43:32.957 --> 01:43:45.000
So, tonight we are praising Shri Krishna who is Yogeshwara.

01:43:46.960 --> 01:43:51.860
He eats but He does not eat. He sleeps but He does not sleep.

01:43:53.584 --> 01:44:02.683
He has wives but He has no wife. Like this is the Yogeshwara,

01:44:03.081 --> 01:44:06.814
and that is what you are Yogis, and He is your Ishwara,

01:44:06.950 --> 01:44:09.283
so, you have to try to be like Him.

01:44:09.654 --> 01:44:14.666
Let your brain be enlightened by His blessings.

01:44:14.825 --> 01:44:19.492
And you’ll become that great personality
that encompasses everything,

01:44:20.500 --> 01:44:23.766
that sees everything, that gives you discretion,

01:44:24.328 --> 01:44:26.995
that makes you understand what’s wrong.

01:44:27.206 --> 01:44:33.261
And you feel enthousiastic about changing this America

01:44:33.618 --> 01:44:37.110
with all your efforts, with all the mind.

01:44:37.289 --> 01:44:40.046
That’s the most important thing you have to do.

01:44:40.261 --> 01:44:48.261
As it is, He is a Kubera, He is the Lord of Wealth

01:44:48.618 --> 01:44:51.031
and He has given you such a lot of

01:44:51.289 --> 01:44:54.156
wealth all around, you see, just very near

01:44:54.601 --> 01:44:58.001
New York, you should have such a beautiful places.

01:44:58.194 --> 01:45:02.082
In every way, you are blessed: you have money,

01:45:02.182 --> 01:45:04.715
you have everything, you have brains.

01:45:04.920 --> 01:45:08.120
Everything is there. What is lacking is wisdom,

01:45:10.595 --> 01:45:12.852
with everything, with you. Supposing,

01:45:13.547 --> 01:45:16.463
you have a car.

01:45:17.873 --> 01:45:23.261
You’re having a car, you have got keys,
you have got engine, you have brake,

01:45:23.395 --> 01:45:28.598
everything, but you don’t know how to drive, so what will happen?

01:45:31.462 --> 01:45:32.795
This is what it is.

01:45:33.387 --> 01:45:41.025
So, as Sahaja Yogis from America,
you have a very, very, very special responsibility,

01:45:41.958 --> 01:45:43.958
very special responsibility.

01:45:44.379 --> 01:45:49.245
Today we’ll be saying His hundred
and eight names which are well-done,

01:45:50.487 --> 01:45:52.754
have come from Poona all the way.

01:45:53.562 --> 01:45:59.792
So that we’ll have it first and then a little Puja of the Devi.

01:46:00.943 --> 01:46:02.629
May God bless you!
