00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:08.491
Mahatma Gandhi used to say that,

00:00:08.741 --> 00:00:12.158
“What is the non-violence of the weak?”

00:00:12.408 --> 00:00:15.908
A weak has to be non-violent, what’s so great?

00:00:16.908 --> 00:00:22.825
But that’s a policy or a kind of a protection that he has.

00:00:23.117 --> 00:00:26.950
So a weak person has to be non-violent

00:00:27.157 --> 00:00:32.908
because he cannot face, he cannot protest.

00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:41.157
But non-violence of the powerful is the sign of real non-violence.

00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:47.366
Those who are powerful, if they are non-violent,

00:00:47.616 --> 00:00:52.366
that means they are quite confident of their powers.

00:00:52.575 --> 00:00:55.075
Those people who are confident of their powers,

00:00:55.241 --> 00:00:57.449
why should they aggress others?

00:00:57.658 --> 00:01:00.992
They just stand, “All right, come along, what do you want?”

00:01:01.158 --> 00:01:04.199
Even saying that, people run away.

00:01:05.867 --> 00:01:09.616
So those who are violent, angry, hot tempered,

00:01:09.867 --> 00:01:14.408
jump at everyone, torture everyone, trouble everyone,

00:01:14.616 --> 00:01:18.616
are the people who are very weak charactered.

00:01:18.908 --> 00:01:21.491
Their character is weak.

00:01:21.741 --> 00:01:24.491
If their character was all right

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.033
then they would not have done all these things.

00:01:29.033 --> 00:01:34.366
That’s the sign of a person who is either possessed

00:01:34.575 --> 00:01:38.283
and under the influence of the possession - he’s doing that;

00:01:38.491 --> 00:01:42.241
or he’s too weak and he’s possessed by his anger

00:01:42.449 --> 00:01:48.324
because he doesn’t have that much power to bear anything.

00:01:49.199 --> 00:01:51.533
The most powerful thing is the Mother Earth

00:01:51.741 --> 00:01:53.825
because she has a power to bear.

00:01:54.033 --> 00:01:58.366
The one who has the power to bear, is the powerful.

00:01:59.283 --> 00:02:01.908
The one who does not have any power to bear,

00:02:02.117 --> 00:02:04.616
“I can’t bear. I don’t like. I this...”

00:02:04.825 --> 00:02:09.241
Such a person is a useless thing for this earth and sometimes I feel,

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:12.533
“Why God created them?”

00:02:13.075 --> 00:02:15.950
It’s a headache to have a person round you,

00:02:16.157 --> 00:02:18.741
“I can’t eat this. I don’t like this.”

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.992
Then why are you here? Nobody likes you either.

00:02:24.456 --> 00:02:27.491
No one likes such a person and that’s why that person is always,

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.741
“I don’t like this. I don’t like that. I …”

00:02:34.408 --> 00:02:40.158
So the power of a person lies in bearing things.

00:02:40.491 --> 00:02:46.950
How much you can bear, how much you can undergo without feeling it?

00:02:47.157 --> 00:02:50.616
Like, you are say, in the jungle, you are happy.

00:02:50.825 --> 00:02:53.199
If you are in a palace you are happy.

00:02:53.408 --> 00:02:57.157
If you are with the this color or that color,

00:02:57.324 --> 00:02:59.950
if you are with this race or that race,

00:03:00.157 --> 00:03:06.157
if you are with this kind of life or that kind of life,

00:03:06.491 --> 00:03:08.241
you can bear it.

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:13.992
And that bearing power gives you the caliber,

00:03:14.491 --> 00:03:19.658
the caliber to have Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:19.867 --> 00:03:26.950
It’s not that this is shown, it’s not that is being suffered,

00:03:28.033 --> 00:03:34.700
don’t have to say, “I suffer being like this.” No, you don’t suffer.

00:03:34.908 --> 00:03:37.950
It’s just by the way.

00:03:39.783 --> 00:03:43.491
For a person who wants all the comforts,

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.783
a person who wants to live with all the luxuries,

00:03:49.783 --> 00:03:55.616
but not with any kind of defects or any deficiencies,

00:03:55.908 --> 00:04:00.908
is a person is a beggar, I would say, in every sense of the word.
