00:12.000 --> 00:20.911
The lotus of your Sahasrara is open now.

00:22.481 --> 00:28.740
It must open more and more and more

00:28.941 --> 00:31.651
and should not suddenly collapse,

00:31.681 --> 00:35.691
again open, again collapse.

00:39.813 --> 00:45.313
It's a very complicated phenomena you can see in the West

00:45.773 --> 00:48.745
and you can be very much surprised sometimes.

00:48.946 --> 00:52.181
To Me it's sometimes very shocking to see.

00:52.382 --> 00:56.094
Suddenly someone will come, "Oh, I'm very nervous about this thing.

00:56.295 --> 00:58.248
I'm very nervous about that."

00:58.329 --> 01:00.049
Another person will come and tell Me,

01:00.130 --> 01:05.273
"I want to leave Sahaja Yoga now." Another one comes and tells me,

01:05.474 --> 01:11.231
"Oh, it's too much, I cannot go any further with it."

01:17.013 --> 01:22.817
So we must realize that there is something very peculiar

01:23.018 --> 01:25.365
within us,

01:25.566 --> 01:29.776
something absurd within us. That's why it happens.

01:29.985 --> 01:33.056
We go forward, backwards, forward, backwards all the time.

01:33.257 --> 01:36.327
What is this pendulum?

01:37.572 --> 01:42.485
That cannot be Sahasrara. Sahasrara is not a pendulum,

01:42.686 --> 01:45.345
it is a lotus.

01:49.383 --> 01:53.939
So the pendulum is the chitta, is the attention;

01:54.140 --> 01:57.022
the attention that moves from left to right,

01:57.223 --> 02:02.559
right to left, goes on
like that all the time.

02:08.248 --> 02:14.779
But the area of Sahasrara is the realm of God.

02:17.936 --> 02:23.846
When the Brahmarandra opens fully,

02:24.047 --> 02:28.172
then the heavens open within yourself.

02:32.451 --> 02:41.004
The Kundalini, which has risen up and given you Realization,

02:41.205 --> 02:44.817
creates that subtle opening, by which

02:45.018 --> 02:48.939
the Divine starts pouring all its
subtleties inside

02:49.140 --> 02:51.877
your brain.

02:53.823 --> 02:57.823
But if you are pressing it from both the sides with these balloons,

02:58.024 --> 03:01.392
sometimes opening, sometimes closing, sometimes opening,

03:01.593 --> 03:05.915
the Divine recedes Its attention. You must know that.

03:06.116 --> 03:09.999
The attention is receded back and if it is done many a times,

03:10.200 --> 03:14.067
the Divine doesn't bother.

03:19.215 --> 03:23.488
So it is you who has to achieve that state

03:23.689 --> 03:29.157
and all of us can achieve that state of Nirvikalpa.

03:31.116 --> 03:36.418
In that there is just progression.

03:36.619 --> 03:40.357
After Nirvikalpa you cannot come down.

03:40.558 --> 03:42.972
If somebody is still

03:43.173 --> 03:44.902
going up and down, up and down,

03:45.103 --> 03:51.298
he should know he is still not up to the point

03:51.499 --> 03:55.089
and he should face up to himself

03:55.290 --> 03:59.470
and tell himself or herself that

03:59.671 --> 04:06.166
"No, I have to be into Nirvikalpa,

04:06.367 --> 04:10.085
where I do not come down."

04:11.578 --> 04:15.605
The people who are not in the Nirvikalpa state

04:15.806 --> 04:21.985
are not going to be saved. I am very sorry to say that.

04:28.553 --> 04:33.474
They are not going to be saved.

04:34.396 --> 04:37.896
They will be punished.

04:38.306 --> 04:43.662
May not be in the same way those who are not Realized souls,

04:43.863 --> 04:48.511
but they will not occupy

04:48.712 --> 04:53.204
the seats in the realm of God Almighty.

04:54.263 --> 04:59.708
At least you must reach the state of Nirvikalpa.

05:02.344 --> 05:06.355
Do not blame any circumstance.

05:06.668 --> 05:12.535
Do not blame your father, mother, brother, atmosphere, this, that.

05:12.750 --> 05:16.750
There's no need to blame anyone.

05:19.634 --> 05:22.685
“Because somebody came, we were influenced.”

05:22.886 --> 05:25.018
What is the matter with you?

05:25.219 --> 05:28.427
I am here, you are not influenced by Me.

05:28.628 --> 05:32.846
How are you influenced by somebody who is so stupid, obviously,

05:33.047 --> 05:36.132
so dominating?

05:40.024 --> 05:44.281
That means - what is your level?
