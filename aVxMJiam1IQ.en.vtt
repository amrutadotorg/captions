00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.911
The lotus of your Sahasrara is open now.

00:00:22.481 --> 00:00:28.740
It must open more and more and more

00:00:28.941 --> 00:00:31.651
and should not suddenly collapse,

00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:35.691
again open, again collapse.

00:00:39.813 --> 00:00:45.313
 It's a very complicated phenomena you can see in the West

00:00:45.773 --> 00:00:48.745
and you can be very much surprised sometimes.

00:00:48.946 --> 00:00:52.181
To Me it's sometimes very shocking to see.

00:00:52.382 --> 00:00:56.094
Suddenly someone will come, "Oh, I'm very nervous about this thing.

00:00:56.295 --> 00:00:58.248
I'm very nervous about that."

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:00.049
Another person will come and tell Me,

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:05.273
"I want to leave Sahaja Yoga now." Another one comes and tells me,

00:01:05.474 --> 00:01:11.231
"Oh, it's too much, I cannot go any further with it."

00:01:17.013 --> 00:01:22.817
So we must realize that there is something very peculiar

00:01:23.018 --> 00:01:25.365
within us,

00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:29.776
something absurd within us. That's why it happens.

00:01:29.985 --> 00:01:33.056
We go forward, backwards, forward, backwards all the time.

00:01:33.257 --> 00:01:36.327
What is this pendulum?

00:01:37.572 --> 00:01:42.485
That cannot be Sahasrara. Sahasrara is not a pendulum,

00:01:42.686 --> 00:01:45.345
it is a lotus.

00:01:49.383 --> 00:01:53.939
So the pendulum is the chitta, is the attention;

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.022
the attention that moves from left to right,

00:01:57.223 --> 00:02:02.559
right to left, goes on
like that all the time.

00:02:08.248 --> 00:02:14.779
But the area of Sahasrara is the realm of God.

00:02:17.936 --> 00:02:23.846
When the Brahmarandra opens fully,

00:02:24.047 --> 00:02:28.172
then the heavens open within yourself.

00:02:32.451 --> 00:02:41.004
The Kundalini, which has risen up and given you Realization,

00:02:41.205 --> 00:02:44.817
creates that subtle opening, by which

00:02:45.018 --> 00:02:48.939
the Divine starts pouring all its
subtleties inside

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.877
your brain.

00:02:53.823 --> 00:02:57.823
But if you are pressing it from both the sides with these balloons,

00:02:58.024 --> 00:03:01.392
sometimes opening, sometimes closing, sometimes opening,

00:03:01.593 --> 00:03:05.915
the Divine recedes Its attention. You must know that.

00:03:06.116 --> 00:03:09.999
The attention is receded back and if it is done many a times,

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.067
the Divine doesn't bother.

00:03:19.215 --> 00:03:23.488
So it is you who has to achieve that state

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:29.157
and all of us can achieve that state of Nirvikalpa.

00:03:31.116 --> 00:03:36.418
In that there is just progression.

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:40.357
After Nirvikalpa you cannot come down.

00:03:40.558 --> 00:03:42.972
If somebody is still

00:03:43.173 --> 00:03:44.902
going up and down, up and down,

00:03:45.103 --> 00:03:51.298
he should know he is still not up to the point

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:55.089
and he should face up to himself

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.470
and tell himself or herself that

00:03:59.671 --> 00:04:06.166
"No, I have to be into Nirvikalpa,

00:04:06.367 --> 00:04:10.085
where I do not come down."

00:04:11.578 --> 00:04:15.605
The people who are not in the Nirvikalpa state

00:04:15.806 --> 00:04:21.985
are not going to be saved. I am very sorry to say that.

00:04:28.553 --> 00:04:33.474
They are not going to be saved.

00:04:34.396 --> 00:04:37.896
They will be punished.

00:04:38.306 --> 00:04:43.662
May not be in the same way those who are not Realized souls,

00:04:43.863 --> 00:04:48.511
but they will not occupy

00:04:48.712 --> 00:04:53.204
the seats in the realm of God Almighty.

00:04:54.263 --> 00:04:59.708
At least you must reach the state of Nirvikalpa.

00:05:02.344 --> 00:05:06.355
Do not blame any circumstance.

00:05:06.668 --> 00:05:12.535
Do not blame your father, mother, brother, atmosphere, this, that.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.750
There's no need to blame anyone.

00:05:19.634 --> 00:05:22.685
“Because somebody came, we were influenced.”

00:05:22.886 --> 00:05:25.018
What is the matter with you?

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:28.427
I am here, you are not influenced by Me.

00:05:28.628 --> 00:05:32.846
How are you influenced by somebody who is so stupid, obviously,

00:05:33.047 --> 00:05:36.132
so dominating?

00:05:40.024 --> 00:05:44.281
That means - what is your level?
