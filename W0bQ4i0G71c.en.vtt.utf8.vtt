WEBVTT

00:13.250 --> 00:18.119
his musicians all of them are so young

00:16.170 --> 00:20.789
we must have seen and one is a blind

00:18.119 --> 00:25.019
fellow and with realization they became

00:20.789 --> 00:27.570
so dynamic so now they want to play for

00:25.019 --> 00:28.140
me and sing for me because they got it

00:27.570 --> 00:30.689
too you see

00:28.140 --> 00:33.120
and the one who has composed it was a

00:30.689 --> 00:35.280
chartered accountant he never knew and

00:33.120 --> 00:38.430
is any do or renew

00:35.280 --> 01:03.660
I mean political language but he's

00:38.430 --> 01:06.479
become appointed emotional music and

01:03.660 --> 01:10.939
musical devotional music is sung by

01:06.479 --> 01:15.170
people who are realized Souls reaches

01:10.939 --> 01:19.890
your heart reaches your Kundalini and

01:15.170 --> 01:21.450
helps a lot awaken them so if there are

01:19.890 --> 01:24.869
these are all realized Souls so where

01:21.450 --> 01:28.130
there the dancer everybody the dancer

01:24.869 --> 01:31.259
was playing the rhythm and the rhythm it

01:28.130 --> 01:33.360
is a divine rhythm because she is now

01:31.259 --> 01:35.780
become a realized soul she's connected

01:33.360 --> 01:39.240
with the divine so when she dances she

01:35.780 --> 01:40.170
creates her divine rhythm and when these

01:39.240 --> 01:42.420
people sing

01:40.170 --> 01:44.850
they also sing a divine devotion

01:42.420 --> 01:47.640
otherwise without connection if you sing

01:44.850 --> 01:50.009
the praise of God it doesn't reach God

01:47.640 --> 01:52.619
because you are not connected like a

01:50.009 --> 01:54.780
telephone which is not connected if you

01:52.619 --> 01:57.329
start telephoning your telephone gets

01:54.780 --> 01:59.310
spot so for devotion also you should be

01:57.329 --> 02:03.890
connected with God so as they're

01:59.310 --> 02:05.869
connected with the divine the music

02:03.890 --> 02:08.970
image

02:05.869 --> 02:11.910
vibrations what to call the divine

02:08.970 --> 02:14.370
vibration as a result it creates an

02:11.910 --> 02:16.920
atmosphere for people to receive the

02:14.370 --> 02:19.170
realization it becomes much easier for

02:16.920 --> 02:22.500
me to give realization because that

02:19.170 --> 02:26.010
masseur cleanser rinses out and people

02:22.500 --> 02:28.950
also get ready for realization because

02:26.010 --> 02:32.280
they're realized Souls all of them so

02:28.950 --> 02:33.720
this is the reason why I was very happy

02:32.280 --> 02:36.000
they could manage to come they're all

02:33.720 --> 02:39.780
professionals and they have agreed to

02:36.000 --> 02:43.590
come here and do it further just to help

02:39.780 --> 02:45.989
me in sahaja yoga and also you will be

02:43.590 --> 02:47.580
surprised that this music is very

02:45.989 --> 02:50.220
difficult indeed music is a very

02:47.580 --> 02:52.470
difficult music it's not easy for people

02:50.220 --> 02:57.030
to sing unless until you go into big

02:52.470 --> 02:59.940
practices but it's so amazing that when

02:57.030 --> 03:02.790
people get realization all these people

02:59.940 --> 03:05.310
who are Western are people from 40

03:02.790 --> 03:08.489
countries they all can sing these songs

03:05.310 --> 03:11.160
with same depth and with same

03:08.489 --> 03:13.890
understanding without making any

03:11.160 --> 03:16.549
mistakes even in pronunciation otherwise

03:13.890 --> 03:18.630
it is so difficult to pronounce a state

03:16.549 --> 03:21.959
even Indian language is so difficult

03:18.630 --> 03:25.500
that they could not even pronounce a one

03:21.959 --> 03:27.780
sentence property and now the whole song

03:25.500 --> 03:30.090
is has to song any song this thing's

03:27.780 --> 03:31.560
over and you if you close your eyes you

03:30.090 --> 03:33.540
won't believe that they are foreigners

03:31.560 --> 03:36.350
who are singing who have never known

03:33.540 --> 03:38.940
this language so something has gone

03:36.350 --> 03:42.380
dynamically new in them that they just

03:38.940 --> 03:42.380
pick it up and sing so well

03:47.410 --> 03:54.910
of course very much music is is is a

03:52.140 --> 03:57.220
divine gift to human beings it's a

03:54.910 --> 04:00.760
divine we call it starts with Omkara

03:57.220 --> 04:02.830
means the first word is that was we call

04:00.760 --> 04:05.230
as locusts it starts with that and

04:02.830 --> 04:07.360
that's that's a proof of it because the

04:05.230 --> 04:09.880
when they get their realization how is

04:07.360 --> 04:13.720
it they know such difficult language and

04:09.880 --> 04:16.989
such difficult tunes and so correctly as

04:13.720 --> 04:19.600
they can see it's very surprising so

04:16.989 --> 04:24.010
music is a very inner part dancing music

04:19.600 --> 04:26.560
all art is very kind much connected with

04:24.010 --> 04:28.270
the divine now we have had many artists

04:26.560 --> 04:31.840
who have been realized Souls because a

04:28.270 --> 04:34.920
Michelangelo was a realized soul and the

04:31.840 --> 04:41.260
way he painted hence it emits vibrations

04:34.920 --> 04:43.570
you see if you see Mona Lisa and by they

04:41.260 --> 04:46.990
are not of the wind say it has

04:43.570 --> 04:49.090
vibrations it gives you abrasions those

04:46.990 --> 04:51.400
people who were realized Souls like

04:49.090 --> 04:53.800
Mozart when you play Mozart you get

04:51.400 --> 04:56.620
vibrations out of it you can feel them

04:53.800 --> 05:01.110
on your fingertips you can feel so there

04:56.620 --> 05:01.110
are musicians who are realized Souls

05:02.280 --> 05:10.210
also artists also people like Abraham

05:07.870 --> 05:13.420
Lincoln was a realized soul Gorbachev is

05:10.210 --> 05:15.520
realized so he's also a sage so when

05:13.420 --> 05:17.290
these people are there how will you make

05:15.520 --> 05:19.090
them out and she was asking me you have

05:17.290 --> 05:22.320
to just put your hands towards them and

05:19.090 --> 05:22.320
you can feel it
