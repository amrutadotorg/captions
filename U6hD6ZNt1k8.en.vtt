WEBVTT

00:01.480 --> 00:11.560
Today we are worshipping Adi Shakti.

00:12.640 --> 00:20.680
I think this is the most important puja

00:22.560 --> 00:29.880
because it is the power of Adi Shakti

00:30.040 --> 00:33.960
that has given you Self Realisation,

00:34.440 --> 00:37.840
that has given you the Truth,

00:38.120 --> 00:43.960
that has given you the power of compassion and love.

00:55.280 --> 01:06.040
That's the power that separated from Sadashiva

01:08.320 --> 01:26.280
and this power wanted Herself to create this complete universe.

01:26.760 --> 01:36.720
Universes after universes, She's creating and loving.

01:36.880 --> 01:45.160
With Her love, She did this great creation,

01:45.320 --> 01:50.680
creation of this world also.

01:50.960 --> 01:57.280
This is a specially selected planet,

01:57.440 --> 02:04.040
which was very beautifully brought in the centre

02:04.200 --> 02:07.640
between the sun and the moon

02:09.160 --> 02:17.000
for the creation of, ultimately, the human beings.

02:18.960 --> 02:30.320
This is Her great work with such love and affection

02:30.960 --> 02:34.280
and with very great hope

02:35.760 --> 02:43.480
that Her children will know the truth

02:43.960 --> 02:48.320
and will get the ultimate knowledge about themselves

02:48.480 --> 02:52.600
and about everything else.

02:59.040 --> 03:03.120
As you have read in the Bible

03:03.280 --> 03:09.920
about how Adi Shakti came in the form of a snake

03:10.080 --> 03:13.280
and told human beings

03:13.440 --> 03:22.360
that you have to know the knowledge,

03:22.520 --> 03:28.720
Adam and Eve, and to Eve specially,

03:28.880 --> 03:35.560
and they accepted to eat the fruit of knowledge

03:36.120 --> 03:41.000
because they would have remained just like animals,

03:41.160 --> 03:44.960
without knowing anything subtleties of life —

03:45.120 --> 03:48.720
little higher animals maybe  —

03:50.440 --> 03:57.240
that once they ate the fruit they started feeling

03:57.920 --> 04:01.160
that there is something wrong the

04:01.320 --> 04:05.280
way they are without any clothes,

04:05.800 --> 04:10.800
so they brought some leaves of the tree

04:10.960 --> 04:14.400
and covered themselves.

04:14.920 --> 04:21.800
So the first knowledge came was of chastity

04:22.680 --> 04:28.160
because Shri Ganesha was established

04:28.360 --> 04:36.320
and His influence brought forth this consciousness

04:36.480 --> 04:39.400
that we have to cover our bodies.

04:39.560 --> 04:42.960
We are no more animals.

04:43.120 --> 04:47.080
Only the animals

04:47.240 --> 04:49.920
— of course, they're not standing, so it is all right —

04:50.080 --> 04:53.080
are not aware of it.

04:56.720 --> 05:02.040
With the knowledge of chastity,

05:02.200 --> 05:06.360
gradually human beings started growing

05:06.840 --> 05:11.080
into beautiful nations,

05:12.760 --> 05:19.360
but there are so many things,  which were still to be known,

05:20.880 --> 05:23.760
to be aware of it.

05:24.760 --> 05:32.440
You may be aware of many things,

05:35.960 --> 05:45.880
but unless and until you get your spiritual awakening,

05:46.920 --> 05:51.520
unless and until you get your self knowledge,

05:51.680 --> 05:58.000
all other knowledge is absolutely nothing.

06:02.120 --> 06:07.720
With this self knowledge only, you become powerful.

06:07.880 --> 06:15.440
The real power — the real power is of love and compassion.

06:18.600 --> 06:26.920
Today when you see the whole world is busy fighting

06:27.080 --> 06:32.760
and they are trying to protect people

06:32.920 --> 06:37.680
from wars and creating

06:37.840 --> 06:46.320
great, huge, protecting instruments.

06:47.600 --> 06:52.560
The whole world seems to be in a mad race

06:52.720 --> 06:58.640
of killing each other, of destroying each other,

06:58.800 --> 07:07.760
of competition, ambition,

07:07.920 --> 07:13.280
leading to fighting and then to greater wars.

07:13.560 --> 07:19.120
They're fighting for a piece of land.

07:20.080 --> 07:23.440
So ignorant they are.

07:23.600 --> 07:32.280
Can you carry even a pinch of this land with you

07:32.440 --> 07:35.080
when you die?

07:37.360 --> 07:41.320
When you are born you come with closed fists.

07:41.480 --> 07:46.520
When you die you go with open hands.

07:47.080 --> 07:50.680
What do you take with you?

07:50.840 --> 07:55.640
All right, you may not like to take anything,

07:55.800 --> 08:00.040
but do you enjoy whatever you think is so great

08:00.200 --> 08:03.480
for which you are fighting?

08:04.200 --> 08:11.040
Why this fighting going on among all nonsensical people?

08:11.880 --> 08:21.200
It's surprising how people give up their peace,

08:21.360 --> 08:24.440
give up their understanding

08:24.600 --> 08:30.200
when it comes to a piece of land.

08:33.800 --> 08:40.040
And the whole thing has moved into a very wrong direction

08:40.200 --> 08:46.480
and going towards complete destruction.

08:47.480 --> 08:57.400
The thing that has made human beings so much suffering

08:57.560 --> 09:05.520
because of all their ignorance,

09:05.680 --> 09:11.960
by which they have all those habits,

09:12.120 --> 09:15.800
all those attractions,

09:15.960 --> 09:22.560
all those identification, which is ruinous,

09:22.720 --> 09:30.280
which will ruin all of them, each one by one.

09:32.360 --> 09:34.880
They have to take to sense

09:35.040 --> 09:42.320
and they have to take to their self knowledge.

09:42.480 --> 09:50.960
Self knowledge is the key

09:51.960 --> 09:59.240
for a saviour to give to people.

10:01.120 --> 10:04.920
We have had so many saints.

10:05.080 --> 10:09.200
We have had so many Sufis.

10:09.360 --> 10:13.920
We had Tao people. We had Zen people.

10:14.080 --> 10:20.160
All kinds of realised souls came on this Earth.

10:21.160 --> 10:27.120
They all suffered. They were tortured. Nobody understood them.

10:28.560 --> 10:36.120
But now the time has come for you to know the truth,

10:36.600 --> 10:43.160
but truth which is not dry, truth which has compassion,

10:43.320 --> 10:47.320
truth that encompasses everyone,

10:47.480 --> 10:55.680
that brings the complete view of our existence.

10:55.840 --> 11:02.320
Why are we here on this Earth? What is our purpose?

11:02.480 --> 11:05.440
What should we do? Adi Shakti's

11:06.680 --> 11:10.840
powers are such

11:11.000 --> 11:14.600
of love and compassion,

11:14.760 --> 11:19.960
that makes you understand your self first.

11:21.120 --> 11:27.400
The love, for you, is very, very limited.

11:27.960 --> 11:35.080
There's no awareness of your own being.

11:35.240 --> 11:40.200
Just imagine what a great task is for you,

11:40.760 --> 11:46.360
how much you have to be seriously

11:46.520 --> 11:51.200
becoming aware of your self first.

11:52.240 --> 11:56.000
That is extremely important.

11:56.680 --> 12:01.280
First you have to be aware of your self.

12:03.440 --> 12:07.640
And now you have the light of your spirit.

12:07.800 --> 12:12.560
In the light of that spirit you can see what you are

12:12.880 --> 12:16.360
and you can see how far you are going,

12:16.520 --> 12:20.160
how wrong things you are doing,

12:20.320 --> 12:24.680
what harm you are doing to yourself

12:25.560 --> 12:29.200
and you have a power to cure it,

12:29.360 --> 12:34.560
to improve it and to come to your senses.

12:34.720 --> 12:39.120
These are the most important times.

12:39.280 --> 12:42.440
You will never get these times again.

12:42.600 --> 12:49.400
Never had it in the history and you can never get it in the future.

12:50.360 --> 12:57.320
This is the time you have got, not only the awareness,

12:57.480 --> 13:01.560
not only the self knowledge,

13:01.720 --> 13:05.760
but you know how to do it.

13:06.160 --> 13:09.280
Otherwise, about the saints,

13:09.440 --> 13:13.960
about those people, Tao and Zen people,

13:14.120 --> 13:16.800
they have just described

13:16.960 --> 13:23.720
what a person with self knowledge is,

13:23.880 --> 13:28.920
how he behaves, how his style is,

13:29.080 --> 13:32.080
how he's so different from others.

13:32.240 --> 13:37.280
But none of them have said how you become that.

13:38.280 --> 13:41.920
No one has been able to say that.

13:42.080 --> 13:46.080
Nobody has been able to do that also

13:46.240 --> 13:54.680
because perhaps most of them didn't know about kundalini

13:54.920 --> 14:02.040
and those who knew also could not talk about it to people.

14:02.880 --> 14:08.280
So the greatest work of the Adi Shakti is

14:08.440 --> 14:17.720
to put the kundalini  in your sacrum bone.

14:19.840 --> 14:26.240
This kundalini is not the Adi Shakti.

14:26.400 --> 14:29.960
The Adi Shakti is a much greater thing, a much bigger thing,

14:30.120 --> 14:35.440
much wider thing, much deeper, much stronger,

14:35.640 --> 14:38.880
much stronger, much more powerful.

14:39.040 --> 14:46.720
Kundalini is the reflection of Adi Shakti power

14:47.880 --> 14:54.160
and when She rises you know what happens to you

14:54.600 --> 15:00.400
and how you get your Realisation.

15:01.600 --> 15:05.360
But you have to be very watchful.

15:05.600 --> 15:10.360
Are you really a compassionate person?

15:12.080 --> 15:14.920
If you are compassionate,

15:15.080 --> 15:18.600
the first thing that will happen to any compassionate person,

15:18.760 --> 15:25.480
I think, will be to help others,

15:25.640 --> 15:28.400
to emancipate others.

15:28.560 --> 15:34.880
They cannot be satisfied with their own achievements

15:35.040 --> 15:44.080
and with their own state of Self Realisation.

15:44.240 --> 15:46.680
It cannot happen.

15:47.120 --> 15:53.160
What was the need for the Adi Shakti to do all, all these efforts

15:53.320 --> 15:55.012
to work so hard?

15:55.173 --> 16:00.160
You know that, that I had to work very, very hard,

16:00.320 --> 16:03.800
but, from my very childhood

16:04.440 --> 16:07.360
I've worked very hard

16:07.520 --> 16:12.800
and I've gone through very difficult times,

16:12.960 --> 16:19.840
very, very difficult times according to human understanding,

16:20.000 --> 16:26.000
but the worst time I have, when I see

16:26.160 --> 16:30.400
those people whom I have given Realisation,

16:30.560 --> 16:34.520
those who are self-realised people,

16:34.680 --> 16:42.320
they are the ones who have no responsibility for others

16:42.480 --> 16:46.360
and, if they have, it is very little.

16:46.520 --> 16:49.680
They don't have that compassion

16:49.840 --> 16:52.720
and don't have that love

16:52.880 --> 16:56.560
that we have to today save the world,

16:56.720 --> 16:58.960
save the humanity.

16:59.120 --> 17:05.360
That's our — not only our principal work,

17:05.520 --> 17:10.360
but the only work that we have to do.

17:10.520 --> 17:15.880
All other things are going to achieve nothing,

17:16.040 --> 17:21.800
except for your own efforts here,

17:21.960 --> 17:24.640
individual efforts

17:24.800 --> 17:28.120
to give Self Realisation to others

17:28.280 --> 17:32.120
and give them this knowledge.

17:32.280 --> 17:38.160
This knowledge is so, so easy to understand.

17:38.320 --> 17:41.800
It is very subtle, no doubt,

17:41.960 --> 17:44.720
and, as I've told you,

17:44.880 --> 17:51.080
that the quantum theory they're talking about now, the scientists,

17:51.240 --> 17:57.160
is that they have seen those miraculous waves of lights

17:57.320 --> 18:02.440
and they are trying to find out something about it.

18:02.600 --> 18:09.640
It cannot be that some Sahaja Yogis will rise above others.

18:09.800 --> 18:16.920
Every one of you [has] to know that this is a very special thing

18:17.080 --> 18:20.160
that has happened to you.

18:20.320 --> 18:22.880
Even if you had gone to Himalayas,

18:23.040 --> 18:25.600
even if you have starved yourself,

18:25.760 --> 18:32.080
even if you have been singing the praise of God for years,

18:32.240 --> 18:38.960
even   you had done all kinds of rituals and penances,

18:39.120 --> 18:41.920
you could not have got your Realisation.

18:42.080 --> 18:44.520
That would not have been possible.

18:44.680 --> 18:51.160
I knew this. That's why I have to work very hard,

18:51.320 --> 18:56.920
facing all kinds of problems, all kinds of turmoils,

18:57.080 --> 19:02.480
all kinds of pressures, what was the thing?

19:02.640 --> 19:09.480
Just to see that you all are created

19:09.640 --> 19:12.760
and you're all My hands.

19:12.920 --> 19:18.720
You have to work. Every finger has to work.

19:18.880 --> 19:21.720
And that is what I have been telling you,

19:21.880 --> 19:29.240
that now it is our responsibility to see that we become,

19:29.400 --> 19:36.400
not only Sahaja Yogis ourself, but blossoming time

19:36.640 --> 19:42.360
and many, many Sahaja Yogis we should have.

19:43.960 --> 19:48.640
It's a work of Adi Shakti.

19:48.800 --> 19:51.520
Try to understand this.

19:51.680 --> 19:55.480
It's not work of any saint.

19:55.640 --> 20:00.240
It's not work of any incarnation.

20:00.400 --> 20:04.280
It's not work of any politician.

20:04.440 --> 20:10.720
And not work of any big leader.

20:10.880 --> 20:14.920
It is the work of Adi Shakti,

20:15.120 --> 20:22.280
which is so transparently showing its results in you.

20:22.440 --> 20:28.320
Now it is for you to see.

20:29.800 --> 20:36.720
To please Me is your ardent desire, I know.

20:36.880 --> 20:46.400
I see how you love Me and how you want to do for Me.

20:46.560 --> 20:50.480
The greatest thing you can do for Me

20:50.640 --> 20:54.920
is to spread Sahaja Yoga.

20:55.480 --> 21:03.160
It is a very special, extremely difficult blessings you have got.

21:05.920 --> 21:09.360
You didn't have to do any efforts.

21:09.520 --> 21:13.600
You didn't have to pay any money.

21:14.400 --> 21:22.520
You don't have to get sick with rituals.

21:22.680 --> 21:26.720
You got it spontaneously.

21:27.680 --> 21:33.280
But that doesn't mean that it's sort of your birthright to get it.

21:33.440 --> 21:37.480
[It] is the work of Adi Shakti.

21:40.000 --> 21:49.720
And the work of Adi Shakti has to be shown in your life.

21:51.480 --> 21:59.760
[It] is the compassion, without any reward.

22:00.520 --> 22:03.840
People have tried to spread their religion

22:04.000 --> 22:07.680
by showing compassion to poor people,

22:07.840 --> 22:12.800
looking after the poor people, handicapped people.

22:13.880 --> 22:20.400
There's no need, actually, for Sahaja Yogis to do that.

22:21.520 --> 22:26.720
What they have to do is to transform other people.

22:27.000 --> 22:32.160
Find out ways and methods how you can transform,

22:32.480 --> 22:37.120
how you can spread the message of Adi Shakti.

22:37.480 --> 22:39.760
Put your mind to it

22:39.920 --> 22:44.440
and you will know how you can manage it.

22:47.920 --> 22:55.000
There should be all the time compelling desire

22:55.160 --> 22:58.000
that we have to find out method

22:58.160 --> 23:01.960
by which we can spread Sahaja Yoga.

23:02.880 --> 23:09.160
Otherwise it's like what Christ has described

23:09.320 --> 23:16.280
that some seed fell on the marshy land

23:16.840 --> 23:22.760
and they sprouted, but never grew.

23:23.080 --> 23:30.200
You can only grow in the real sense of the word

23:30.840 --> 23:37.120
and become something very, very special and real

23:38.080 --> 23:44.080
by knowing what you can do.

23:45.320 --> 23:48.320
I have a vision, no doubt,

23:48.480 --> 23:52.680
and I've been talking about it quite a lot,

23:52.960 --> 23:59.320
but it ends up with the puja is not a good thing.

24:00.120 --> 24:04.360
I know some countries are very difficult.

24:04.520 --> 24:08.600
Try to find out what is the problem,

24:08.760 --> 24:13.720
why it is so very difficult.

24:14.720 --> 24:19.960
Attention has to be paid to this,

24:20.120 --> 24:27.720
that what other human beings are doing to destroy themselves,

24:29.160 --> 24:32.400
as if it is the part and parcel of the same game

24:32.560 --> 24:37.320
which we call as the last judgement,

24:37.480 --> 24:41.160
but let us, through our compassion and love,

24:41.320 --> 24:44.280
save as many as possible.

24:45.800 --> 24:49.800
This is the work of Adi Shakti,

24:50.360 --> 24:55.200
not the work of any saint or any incarnation.

24:55.360 --> 24:57.960
They're all there, no doubt.

24:58.120 --> 25:03.040
They're all with us, all the time to help us,

25:03.200 --> 25:07.800
but you people have the power of Adi Shakti,

25:08.200 --> 25:11.640
which is very great,

25:11.800 --> 25:15.600
which is very penetrating,

25:15.760 --> 25:18.800
which is miraculous.

25:18.960 --> 25:22.240
It's so effective,

25:22.400 --> 25:28.360
but unless and until you become aware of your own powers,

25:28.520 --> 25:31.520
how will you work it out.

25:31.680 --> 25:37.080
It would be like a dead machine that has everything,

25:37.240 --> 25:41.440
but nobody is there to work it out.

25:41.640 --> 25:48.480
All the time I had to go through very,

25:48.640 --> 25:51.560
very hazardous times

25:51.720 --> 25:58.480
and sometimes I felt that I may have to take another birth,

25:58.640 --> 26:02.560
the way things are so difficult for Me.

26:02.720 --> 26:09.200
But now, for you, it has been very easy,

26:10.120 --> 26:15.320
as if the one who makes the road has to work very hard,

26:15.480 --> 26:17.920
but those who walk on that,

26:18.080 --> 26:23.240
they don't realise how easily they have got it.

26:23.400 --> 26:29.680
And if they realise this, then they will realise also

26:29.840 --> 26:32.840
'Let many walk on this road,

26:33.000 --> 26:35.520
which was created with such

26:35.680 --> 26:39.800
patience, understanding and love.'

26:39.960 --> 26:46.560
I have to really see you all Sahaja Yogis

26:46.720 --> 26:52.200
doing your level best to change this world

26:52.360 --> 26:54.360
— has to be changed.

26:54.520 --> 26:58.280
As it is, humanity has to be saved

26:58.440 --> 27:02.160
through you and nobody else.

27:02.880 --> 27:06.920
No president, no prime minister,

27:07.080 --> 27:09.360
no minister,

27:09.520 --> 27:13.320
none of these people can change the world

27:13.480 --> 27:15.240
and save it.

27:15.400 --> 27:18.320
It is you who are entitled.

27:18.480 --> 27:20.920
You have got this power.

27:21.120 --> 27:27.880
Do you realise your own status?

27:28.040 --> 27:32.680
Your own being?

27:32.840 --> 27:36.400
which has risen so high?

27:36.560 --> 27:42.440
It is not there. If that realisation is there,

27:42.600 --> 27:46.440
you would go all out

27:47.000 --> 27:53.560
to express your love and compassion to other people,

27:53.720 --> 27:58.960
to make them realise what they are.

27:59.120 --> 28:02.200
Only with Sahaja Yoga you can save this world.

28:02.360 --> 28:04.640
There's no other way out.

28:04.800 --> 28:11.520
Whatever you may try, say, to help the poor, to help this and that

28:11.680 --> 28:16.120
is something very, very superficial.

28:16.800 --> 28:24.400
Best thing is to give Realisation to every person you see.

28:26.040 --> 28:29.960
We have seen children. They're coming up.

28:30.120 --> 28:34.800
They'll be great Sahaja Yogis also. I can see that.

28:34.960 --> 28:41.040
But before them, you have to show your own merits

28:41.200 --> 28:44.080
of what you have done.

28:44.240 --> 28:47.160
It's not a static work.

28:47.320 --> 28:53.720
It's a big movement, which has to be really explosive

28:53.880 --> 29:03.240
and unless and until such a great step is taken,

29:07.640 --> 29:16.240
I don't know who will be blamed for the doomsday.

29:18.160 --> 29:23.600
You are the one[s] who have to build up

29:23.760 --> 29:27.360
the destiny of human beings.

29:27.520 --> 29:32.240
Don't consider as yourself, as something nothing.

29:32.400 --> 29:34.880
You could never have got your Realisation.

29:35.040 --> 29:37.120
You'd never have come to Me.

29:37.280 --> 29:41.600
Among so many, you are the ones who came to Me

29:41.760 --> 29:45.880
and who asked for Realisation and got it.

29:46.040 --> 29:48.960
You know it cannot be forced.

29:49.120 --> 29:52.760
This Realisation cannot be forced.

29:52.920 --> 29:56.080
This awareness cannot be forced.

29:56.240 --> 30:03.280
And the growthof this awareness also cannot be forced.

30:03.440 --> 30:09.840
You have to develop that attention deep down within yourself.

30:10.000 --> 30:14.440
And see for yourself what you have done,

30:14.600 --> 30:16.760
what you have done.

30:16.920 --> 30:23.160
If you are still busy with the money problem or the power problem

30:23.320 --> 30:27.720
and this problem and that, you are a problem.

30:27.880 --> 30:30.280
You are not a Sahaja Yogi.

30:30.440 --> 30:34.480
Sahaja Yogi is above everything else

30:34.640 --> 30:38.240
and is very powerful.

30:38.400 --> 30:42.960
Power will be achieved by them

30:43.120 --> 30:45.800
— power of love and compassion,

30:45.960 --> 30:50.200
which is not only words of love.

30:50.360 --> 30:55.960
It is not only act of loving others,

30:56.600 --> 31:05.320
but it is a powerful personality that you will have,

31:05.480 --> 31:08.920
which will just emit

31:09.080 --> 31:19.400
that great Divine Light and can capture people.

31:20.160 --> 31:31.040
All should just take a very brave personality.

31:32.400 --> 31:35.120
I must say people have improved,

31:35.280 --> 31:38.400
otherwise everybody used to write to Me:

31:38.560 --> 31:42.720
'This is wrong with me and that is wrong with my father.

31:42.880 --> 31:47.280
That is wrong with my great-grandmother' and all kinds of things.

31:47.440 --> 31:53.080
That is over now. Much less, I must say, much less.

31:53.800 --> 32:00.920
But instead of telling Me about people who are sick,

32:01.080 --> 32:04.440
people who have failed,

32:04.600 --> 32:12.400
people who are still in a state

32:13.040 --> 32:19.680
that cannot be improved, attention should be changed.

32:19.840 --> 32:25.960
If there's one person who has got cancer anywhere,

32:26.280 --> 32:30.200
immediately at least ten photographs will come to Me.

32:30.360 --> 32:33.800
Leader will write to Me. The wife's leader will write to Me.

32:33.960 --> 32:39.880
Everybody will write to Me that Mother, say such-and-such thing.

32:42.240 --> 32:48.520
Why? Is that My job?

32:48.680 --> 32:52.880
That person can be cured — we have hospitals —

32:53.040 --> 32:56.320
can be cured by photographs,

32:56.480 --> 33:01.640
but attention always goes now to compassion part.

33:01.800 --> 33:07.200
To those people who are so-called suffering physically,

33:07.360 --> 33:11.960
mentally, emotionally, financially,

33:12.160 --> 33:15.040
also in the marriages,

33:18.040 --> 33:21.040
that's not your job,

33:21.200 --> 33:24.000
neither Mine.

33:24.160 --> 33:28.320
If they're sick, they should take a photograph and work it out.

33:28.480 --> 33:32.920
If it doesn't work, that means that it doesn't deserve.

33:35.520 --> 33:42.760
There is no need for you to treat them and to work it out and,

33:42.920 --> 33:45.800
if it fails, to write to Me

33:45.960 --> 33:49.400
that 'Mother, such-and-such person is sick.'

33:49.560 --> 33:52.440
What's so important?

33:53.240 --> 33:59.280
Already we have so many healthy people going round.

33:59.440 --> 34:01.640
Why not use them first?

34:01.800 --> 34:05.960
Our job is not to cure people.

34:06.160 --> 34:11.000
Affection is all right. Compassion is all right. Is a natural thing

34:11.160 --> 34:17.880
that our attention goes to sick people or to the poor people

34:18.040 --> 34:22.520
or to the people who are suffering,

34:22.680 --> 34:27.960
but what about Sahaj Yog?

34:31.320 --> 34:34.600
If you have one sick person,

34:34.760 --> 34:38.880
hundred Sahaja Yogis will get after that.

34:39.040 --> 34:42.280
What is the reason?

34:42.440 --> 34:46.360
Is it compassion?

34:46.520 --> 34:48.720
It's not.

34:50.440 --> 34:57.000
They want to prove that they can cure that person.

34:57.960 --> 35:00.880
Is not compassion.

35:01.040 --> 35:04.320
Compassion today is

35:04.480 --> 35:10.840
to transform human beings into Sahajis,

35:11.240 --> 35:14.640
into good people.

35:14.800 --> 35:18.880
That is the love of Adi Shakti.

35:19.360 --> 35:23.120
Because those who are born have to die in any case.

35:23.280 --> 35:27.440
We should not be unkind, of course, but

35:27.600 --> 35:33.920
our attention should be how many people we are giving Realisation.

35:34.360 --> 35:37.320
Is a very common thing

35:37.480 --> 35:43.080
that people indulge more into so-called curing

35:43.240 --> 35:48.800
and improving and this. It's all right.

35:49.160 --> 35:54.360
Also there are problems like in the marriages, you see.

35:54.520 --> 35:57.800
Some marriage couple don't want to be there.

35:57.960 --> 36:01.400
It's all right. Finish them.

36:02.360 --> 36:06.520
If they don't want to live together, let them.

36:07.240 --> 36:10.960
We have many people who are sensible in this world,

36:11.120 --> 36:14.920
many people who are healthy in this world.

36:15.600 --> 36:18.440
Now how can you go on struggling with people

36:18.600 --> 36:22.480
who don't want to live together and have problems?

36:23.200 --> 36:25.760
That's not your job.

36:25.920 --> 36:29.000
First of all, you are a spiritual worker.

36:29.160 --> 36:32.320
You are not a social worker.

36:32.480 --> 36:34.040
Of course,

36:34.200 --> 36:39.560
by the way, you can do social work. It doesn't matter, by the way.

36:41.280 --> 36:47.320
But the main thing for you is to transform human beings.

36:48.000 --> 36:52.760
With that, the greatest disease

36:52.920 --> 36:58.600
is of meanness, of cruelty,

37:01.120 --> 37:06.720
of torturing others, anger.

37:07.680 --> 37:11.400
All these diseases can be cured,

37:11.560 --> 37:15.600
which are internal, not external.

37:16.040 --> 37:18.320
That is today wanted.

37:18.480 --> 37:22.480
Every country's fighting and is tortured

37:22.640 --> 37:29.800
and is in peril all the time of getting destroyed.

37:30.760 --> 37:36.080
The only way you can do it is to give them Realisation.

37:36.240 --> 37:40.840
Now what happens is to be seen very clearly

37:41.640 --> 37:47.080
that when you give Realisation to someone

37:47.240 --> 37:52.760
and he values it, and he grows into it,

37:52.960 --> 37:57.440
then you are protected.

37:57.600 --> 38:01.440
You are completely protected.

38:02.000 --> 38:05.800
Who protects you, you may say?

38:05.960 --> 38:08.880
The Adi Shakti, all right,

38:09.040 --> 38:16.680
but also there is a destructive power working in this world,

38:16.840 --> 38:23.520
not of negativity, but positive destructive power of Shiva.

38:24.080 --> 38:35.600
If He says that if Adi Shakti's work is going on well, He's happy.

38:35.880 --> 38:39.640
But He's sitting there and watching each and every person,

38:39.800 --> 38:43.480
each and every work of Sahaja Yogis

38:43.640 --> 38:51.960
and if He finds something really very wrong,

38:52.160 --> 38:55.720
I cannot control it.

38:55.960 --> 39:02.480
He destroys. I cannot go to that point.

39:03.280 --> 39:06.280
He destroys.

39:06.440 --> 39:14.160
Not only destroys, but thousands He can destroy.

39:17.920 --> 39:21.760
Anywhere there is a calamity,

39:21.920 --> 39:28.920
we can say, like an earthquake

39:29.080 --> 39:33.600
or some sort of a hurricane,

39:33.760 --> 39:35.600
all these things come

39:35.760 --> 39:43.640
through the working of Shri Mahadeva.

39:44.880 --> 39:48.240
I can't help you there,

39:48.680 --> 39:54.080
but if you really give Realisation to people,

39:55.800 --> 39:59.440
all these can be averted.

40:00.360 --> 40:06.400
Of course, it is the whim, I should say, of Adi Shakti

40:06.560 --> 40:10.960
that She started this work of creating this world,

40:11.120 --> 40:16.280
of creating you and making you Sahaja Yogis,

40:16.480 --> 40:20.800
but your responsibility is also very important.

40:24.000 --> 40:27.680
You cannot be responsible.

40:30.520 --> 40:40.400
Maybe it was, I felt, My responsibility, but there's a difference.

40:42.160 --> 40:46.600
I never felt it was My responsibility,

40:47.680 --> 40:51.560
never felt this was My job,

40:51.720 --> 40:54.800
never felt I have to do it.

40:54.960 --> 40:57.440
'I did it.'

41:00.800 --> 41:02.760
That is the work.

41:02.920 --> 41:07.200
That's the kind of personality you should have.

41:07.360 --> 41:13.240
You have to do it in a very humble manner,

41:15.360 --> 41:19.880
in a very beautiful manner

41:20.040 --> 41:25.200
and you'll be amazed to see how you are protected,

41:25.360 --> 41:31.880
how you are supported and how everything works out.

41:32.160 --> 41:35.760
The greatest joy you will get when you will find

41:35.920 --> 41:39.000
you can give Realisation to people.

41:40.680 --> 41:44.240
You can change their lives.

41:44.920 --> 41:47.240
Never you would feel such joy,

41:47.400 --> 41:55.360
even if you get, say, a big lottery maybe,

41:55.880 --> 41:59.800
a big job or a big name

41:59.960 --> 42:06.400
or a very big award, no.

42:07.360 --> 42:12.560
The joy of creating Sahaja Yogis

42:13.400 --> 42:18.240
knows no bounds,

42:18.840 --> 42:22.720
is such a joy-giving thing.

42:23.800 --> 42:28.800
You develop such fraternities,

42:28.960 --> 42:35.000
such solidarity, as they call it, such oneness,

42:35.400 --> 42:40.240
such enjoyment of love,

42:40.680 --> 42:43.880
enjoyment of compassion.

42:44.040 --> 42:47.840
It's a different level of enjoyment

42:48.000 --> 42:52.080
that's not like ordinary enjoyments.

42:54.400 --> 42:57.800
You're not to be afraid of Me,

42:57.960 --> 43:02.200
but be afraid of yourself.

43:02.360 --> 43:06.080
Have a watch on yourself and see for yourself

43:06.240 --> 43:09.800
what have you been doing so far.

43:09.960 --> 43:13.200
What have you done so far?

43:13.360 --> 43:19.680
Because you have been enlightened.

43:20.440 --> 43:23.400
If the enlightened people

43:23.560 --> 43:27.400
cannot give light, what's the use in having them?

43:27.560 --> 43:30.320
Look at these little, little candles.

43:30.480 --> 43:36.240
Whatever little light they have, they're giving that light.

43:36.400 --> 43:40.360
They're burning themselves to give that light.

43:40.520 --> 43:46.600
If we cannot give that light,

43:47.880 --> 43:52.160
what is the use of enlightenment?

43:53.320 --> 43:58.040
Enlightened doesn't mean the light for yourself only

43:58.200 --> 44:03.080
the light of love, compassion,

44:03.240 --> 44:09.960
which is divine, which is not normal, which is not ordinary,

44:10.120 --> 44:12.880
as you see in the films.

44:13.040 --> 44:18.400
It is a divine love which works

44:19.600 --> 44:24.640
and that is what makes Me sometimes little weak

44:24.800 --> 44:28.200
when I hear that Sahaja Yogis now

44:28.360 --> 44:32.920
are getting involved in money, in cheating.

44:33.080 --> 44:37.640
I mean, all kinds of criminal activities they do.

44:37.800 --> 44:41.560
I can't understand. I can't believe it.

44:41.720 --> 44:45.680
After getting the highest,

44:45.840 --> 44:51.680
why do you want to go so low as that?

44:51.840 --> 44:57.520
Because you have not yet felt what you have got.

44:59.080 --> 45:03.320
You have not realised what you have got.

45:05.520 --> 45:09.200
And you don't respect yourself.

45:09.600 --> 45:16.560
Still, if you are on the same line and the same level,

45:16.720 --> 45:27.440
I must say you have done no justice to Me or to yourself.

45:27.960 --> 45:31.520
We have to work it out.

45:31.680 --> 45:35.160
Single-handed, I've done it,

45:35.320 --> 45:38.920
worked very hard, I must say,

45:39.080 --> 45:46.240
in the sense that I had to deal with horrible people,

45:47.760 --> 45:54.960
very unkind, very selfish, very cruel.

45:55.720 --> 45:58.680
That doesn't matter.

46:01.080 --> 46:05.120
And such beautiful pearls I have discovered.

46:05.760 --> 46:10.440
But you must keep your lustre

46:10.600 --> 46:13.480
and work it out.

46:13.640 --> 46:20.520
I'll be very happy to know that Sahaja Yoga is spreading

46:20.680 --> 46:25.320
with leaps and bounds, with great speed

46:25.480 --> 46:29.200
and that people are really

46:29.360 --> 46:37.280
getting into that realm

46:37.800 --> 46:44.720
of peace, joy and happiness.

46:44.880 --> 46:47.680
That's My dream

46:47.840 --> 46:51.800
and I hope you all will all work it out.

46:52.240 --> 46:54.920
Thank you very much.
