00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:11.560
Today we are worshipping Adi Shakti.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:20.680
I think this is the most important puja

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.880
because it is the power of Adi Shakti

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.960
that has given you Self Realisation,

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.840
that has given you the Truth,

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.960
that has given you the power of compassion and love.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:06.040
That's the power that separated from Sadashiva

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:26.280
and this power wanted Herself to create this complete universe.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:36.720
Universes after universes, She's creating and loving.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:45.160
With Her love, She did this great creation,

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.680
creation of this world also.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:57.280
This is a specially selected planet,

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:04.040
which was very beautifully brought in the centre

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.640
between the sun and the moon

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:17.000
for the creation of, ultimately, the human beings.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:30.320
This is Her great work with such love and affection

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.280
and with very great hope

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:43.480
that Her children will know the truth

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.320
and will get the ultimate knowledge about themselves

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.600
and about everything else.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.120
As you have read in the Bible

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.920
about how Adi Shakti came in the form of a snake

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.280
and told human beings

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:22.360
that you have to know the knowledge,

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:28.720
Adam and Eve, and to Eve specially,

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:35.560
and they accepted to eat the fruit of knowledge

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.000
because they would have remained just like animals,

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.960
without knowing anything subtleties of life —

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.720
little higher animals maybe  —

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:57.240
that once they ate the fruit they started feeling

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.160
that there is something wrong the

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.280
way they are without any clothes,

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.800
so they brought some leaves of the tree

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.400
and covered themselves.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:21.800
So the first knowledge came was of chastity

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.160
because Shri Ganesha was established

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:36.320
and His influence brought forth this consciousness

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.400
that we have to cover our bodies.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.960
We are no more animals.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.080
Only the animals

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.920
— of course, they're not standing, so it is all right —

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.080
are not aware of it.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:02.040
With the knowledge of chastity,

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.360
gradually human beings started growing

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.080
into beautiful nations,

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:19.360
but there are so many things,  which were still to be known,

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.760
to be aware of it.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:32.440
You may be aware of many things,

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:45.880
but unless and until you get your spiritual awakening,

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.520
unless and until you get your self knowledge,

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:58.000
all other knowledge is absolutely nothing.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:07.720
With this self knowledge only, you become powerful.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:15.440
The real power — the real power is of love and compassion.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:26.920
Today when you see the whole world is busy fighting

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:32.760
and they are trying to protect people

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:37.680
from wars and creating

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:46.320
great, huge, protecting instruments.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:52.560
The whole world seems to be in a mad race

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:58.640
of killing each other, of destroying each other,

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:07.760
of competition, ambition,

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:13.280
leading to fighting and then to greater wars.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:19.120
They're fighting for a piece of land.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.440
So ignorant they are.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:32.280
Can you carry even a pinch of this land with you

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.080
when you die?

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.320
When you are born you come with closed fists.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:46.520
When you die you go with open hands.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:50.680
What do you take with you?

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:55.640
All right, you may not like to take anything,

00:07:55.800 --> 00:08:00.040
but do you enjoy whatever you think is so great

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:03.480
for which you are fighting?

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:11.040
Why this fighting going on among all nonsensical people?

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:21.200
It's surprising how people give up their peace,

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.440
give up their understanding

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:30.200
when it comes to a piece of land.

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:40.040
And the whole thing has moved into a very wrong direction

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:46.480
and going towards complete destruction.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:57.400
The thing that has made human beings so much suffering

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:05.520
because of all their ignorance,

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:11.960
by which they have all those habits,

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:15.800
all those attractions,

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:22.560
all those identification, which is ruinous,

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:30.280
which will ruin all of them, each one by one.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.880
They have to take to sense

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:42.320
and they have to take to their self knowledge.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:50.960
Self knowledge is the key

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:59.240
for a saviour to give to people.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:04.920
We have had so many saints.

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:09.200
We have had so many Sufis.

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:13.920
We had Tao people. We had Zen people.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:20.160
All kinds of realised souls came on this Earth.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:27.120
They all suffered. They were tortured. Nobody understood them.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:36.120
But now the time has come for you to know the truth,

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:43.160
but truth which is not dry, truth which has compassion,

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:47.320
truth that encompasses everyone,

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:55.680
that brings the complete view of our existence.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:02.320
Why are we here on this Earth? What is our purpose?

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:05.440
What should we do? Adi Shakti's

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:10.840
powers are such

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.600
of love and compassion,

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:19.960
that makes you understand your self first.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:27.400
The love, for you, is very, very limited.

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:35.080
There's no awareness of your own being.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:40.200
Just imagine what a great task is for you,

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:46.360
how much you have to be seriously

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:51.200
becoming aware of your self first.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:56.000
That is extremely important.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:01.280
First you have to be aware of your self.

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:07.640
And now you have the light of your spirit.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:12.560
In the light of that spirit you can see what you are

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:16.360
and you can see how far you are going,

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:20.160
how wrong things you are doing,

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:24.680
what harm you are doing to yourself

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:29.200
and you have a power to cure it,

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:34.560
to improve it and to come to your senses.

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:39.120
These are the most important times.

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:42.440
You will never get these times again.

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:49.400
Never had it in the history and you can never get it in the future.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:57.320
This is the time you have got, not only the awareness,

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:01.560
not only the self knowledge,

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:05.760
but you know how to do it.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.280
Otherwise, about the saints,

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:13.960
about those people, Tao and Zen people,

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.800
they have just described

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:23.720
what a person with self knowledge is,

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:28.920
how he behaves, how his style is,

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:32.080
how he's so different from others.

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:37.280
But none of them have said how you become that.

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:41.920
No one has been able to say that.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:46.080
Nobody has been able to do that also

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:54.680
because perhaps most of them didn't know about kundalini

00:13:54.920 --> 00:14:02.040
and those who knew also could not talk about it to people.

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:08.280
So the greatest work of the Adi Shakti is

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:17.720
to put the kundalini  in your sacrum bone.

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:26.240
This kundalini is not the Adi Shakti.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.960
The Adi Shakti is a much greater thing, a much bigger thing,

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:35.440
much wider thing, much deeper, much stronger,

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:38.880
much stronger, much more powerful.

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:46.720
Kundalini is the reflection of Adi Shakti power

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:54.160
and when She rises you know what happens to you

00:14:54.600 --> 00:15:00.400
and how you get your Realisation.

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:05.360
But you have to be very watchful.

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:10.360
Are you really a compassionate person?

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.920
If you are compassionate,

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:18.600
the first thing that will happen to any compassionate person,

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:25.480
I think, will be to help others,

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:28.400
to emancipate others.

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:34.880
They cannot be satisfied with their own achievements

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:44.080
and with their own state of Self Realisation.

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:46.680
It cannot happen.

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:53.160
What was the need for the Adi Shakti to do all, all these efforts

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.012
to work so hard?

00:15:55.173 --> 00:16:00.160
You know that, that I had to work very, very hard,

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:03.800
but, from my very childhood

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:07.360
I've worked very hard

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:12.800
and I've gone through very difficult times,

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:19.840
very, very difficult times according to human understanding,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:26.000
but the worst time I have, when I see

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:30.400
those people whom I have given Realisation,

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:34.520
those who are self-realised people,

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:42.320
they are the ones who have no responsibility for others

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:46.360
and, if they have, it is very little.

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:49.680
They don't have that compassion

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:52.720
and don't have that love

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:56.560
that we have to today save the world,

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:58.960
save the humanity.

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:05.360
That's our — not only our principal work,

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:10.360
but the only work that we have to do.

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:15.880
All other things are going to achieve nothing,

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:21.800
except for your own efforts here,

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.640
individual efforts

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:28.120
to give Self Realisation to others

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:32.120
and give them this knowledge.

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:38.160
This knowledge is so, so easy to understand.

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:41.800
It is very subtle, no doubt,

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.720
and, as I've told you,

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:51.080
that the quantum theory they're talking about now, the scientists,

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:57.160
is that they have seen those miraculous waves of lights

00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:02.440
and they are trying to find out something about it.

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:09.640
It cannot be that some Sahaja Yogis will rise above others.

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:16.920
Every one of you [has] to know that this is a very special thing

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:20.160
that has happened to you.

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.880
Even if you had gone to Himalayas,

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:25.600
even if you have starved yourself,

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:32.080
even if you have been singing the praise of God for years,

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:38.960
even   you had done all kinds of rituals and penances,

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.920
you could not have got your Realisation.

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:44.520
That would not have been possible.

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:51.160
I knew this. That's why I have to work very hard,

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:56.920
facing all kinds of problems, all kinds of turmoils,

00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:02.480
all kinds of pressures, what was the thing?

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:09.480
Just to see that you all are created

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:12.760
and you're all My hands.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:18.720
You have to work. Every finger has to work.

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:21.720
And that is what I have been telling you,

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:29.240
that now it is our responsibility to see that we become,

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:36.400
not only Sahaja Yogis ourself, but blossoming time

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:42.360
and many, many Sahaja Yogis we should have.

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:48.640
It's a work of Adi Shakti.

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:51.520
Try to understand this.

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:55.480
It's not work of any saint.

00:19:55.640 --> 00:20:00.240
It's not work of any incarnation.

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:04.280
It's not work of any politician.

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:10.720
And not work of any big leader.

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:14.920
It is the work of Adi Shakti,

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:22.280
which is so transparently showing its results in you.

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:28.320
Now it is for you to see.

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:36.720
To please Me is your ardent desire, I know.

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:46.400
I see how you love Me and how you want to do for Me.

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:50.480
The greatest thing you can do for Me

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:54.920
is to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:55.480 --> 00:21:03.160
It is a very special, extremely difficult blessings you have got.

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:09.360
You didn't have to do any efforts.

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:13.600
You didn't have to pay any money.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:22.520
You don't have to get sick with rituals.

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:26.720
You got it spontaneously.

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:33.280
But that doesn't mean that it's sort of your birthright to get it.

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:37.480
[It] is the work of Adi Shakti.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:49.720
And the work of Adi Shakti has to be shown in your life.

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:59.760
[It] is the compassion, without any reward.

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:03.840
People have tried to spread their religion

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.680
by showing compassion to poor people,

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:12.800
looking after the poor people, handicapped people.

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:20.400
There's no need, actually, for Sahaja Yogis to do that.

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:26.720
What they have to do is to transform other people.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.160
Find out ways and methods how you can transform,

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:37.120
how you can spread the message of Adi Shakti.

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:39.760
Put your mind to it

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:44.440
and you will know how you can manage it.

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:55.000
There should be all the time compelling desire

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:58.000
that we have to find out method

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:01.960
by which we can spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:09.160
Otherwise it's like what Christ has described

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:16.280
that some seed fell on the marshy land

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:22.760
and they sprouted, but never grew.

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:30.200
You can only grow in the real sense of the word

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:37.120
and become something very, very special and real

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:44.080
by knowing what you can do.

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:48.320
I have a vision, no doubt,

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:52.680
and I've been talking about it quite a lot,

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:59.320
but it ends up with the puja is not a good thing.

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:04.360
I know some countries are very difficult.

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:08.600
Try to find out what is the problem,

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:13.720
why it is so very difficult.

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:19.960
Attention has to be paid to this,

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:27.720
that what other human beings are doing to destroy themselves,

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:32.400
as if it is the part and parcel of the same game

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:37.320
which we call as the last judgement,

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:41.160
but let us, through our compassion and love,

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:44.280
save as many as possible.

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:49.800
This is the work of Adi Shakti,

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:55.200
not the work of any saint or any incarnation.

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:57.960
They're all there, no doubt.

00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:03.040
They're all with us, all the time to help us,

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:07.800
but you people have the power of Adi Shakti,

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:11.640
which is very great,

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:15.600
which is very penetrating,

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:18.800
which is miraculous.

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:22.240
It's so effective,

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:28.360
but unless and until you become aware of your own powers,

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:31.520
how will you work it out.

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:37.080
It would be like a dead machine that has everything,

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:41.440
but nobody is there to work it out.

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:48.480
All the time I had to go through very,

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:51.560
very hazardous times

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:58.480
and sometimes I felt that I may have to take another birth,

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:02.560
the way things are so difficult for Me.

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:09.200
But now, for you, it has been very easy,

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:15.320
as if the one who makes the road has to work very hard,

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.920
but those who walk on that,

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:23.240
they don't realise how easily they have got it.

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:29.680
And if they realise this, then they will realise also

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:32.840
'Let many walk on this road,

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.520
which was created with such

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:39.800
patience, understanding and love.'

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:46.560
I have to really see you all Sahaja Yogis

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:52.200
doing your level best to change this world

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:54.360
— has to be changed.

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:58.280
As it is, humanity has to be saved

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:02.160
through you and nobody else.

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:06.920
No president, no prime minister,

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:09.360
no minister,

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:13.320
none of these people can change the world

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:15.240
and save it.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:18.320
It is you who are entitled.

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.920
You have got this power.

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:27.880
Do you realise your own status?

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:32.680
Your own being?

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:36.400
which has risen so high?

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:42.440
It is not there. If that realisation is there,

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:46.440
you would go all out

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:53.560
to express your love and compassion to other people,

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:58.960
to make them realise what they are.

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:02.200
Only with Sahaja Yoga you can save this world.

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:04.640
There's no other way out.

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:11.520
Whatever you may try, say, to help the poor, to help this and that

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:16.120
is something very, very superficial.

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:24.400
Best thing is to give Realisation to every person you see.

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:29.960
We have seen children. They're coming up.

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:34.800
They'll be great Sahaja Yogis also. I can see that.

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:41.040
But before them, you have to show your own merits

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:44.080
of what you have done.

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:47.160
It's not a static work.

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:53.720
It's a big movement, which has to be really explosive

00:28:53.880 --> 00:29:03.240
and unless and until such a great step is taken,

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:16.240
I don't know who will be blamed for the doomsday.

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:23.600
You are the one[s] who have to build up

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:27.360
the destiny of human beings.

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:32.240
Don't consider as yourself, as something nothing.

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:34.880
You could never have got your Realisation.

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:37.120
You'd never have come to Me.

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:41.600
Among so many, you are the ones who came to Me

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:45.880
and who asked for Realisation and got it.

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:48.960
You know it cannot be forced.

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:52.760
This Realisation cannot be forced.

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:56.080
This awareness cannot be forced.

00:29:56.240 --> 00:30:03.280
And the growthof this awareness also cannot be forced.

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:09.840
You have to develop that attention deep down within yourself.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.440
And see for yourself what you have done,

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:16.760
what you have done.

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:23.160
If you are still busy with the money problem or the power problem

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:27.720
and this problem and that, you are a problem.

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:30.280
You are not a Sahaja Yogi.

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:34.480
Sahaja Yogi is above everything else

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:38.240
and is very powerful.

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:42.960
Power will be achieved by them

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:45.800
— power of love and compassion,

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:50.200
which is not only words of love.

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:55.960
It is not only act of loving others,

00:30:56.600 --> 00:31:05.320
but it is a powerful personality that you will have,

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:08.920
which will just emit

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:19.400
that great Divine Light and can capture people.

00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:31.040
All should just take a very brave personality.

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:35.120
I must say people have improved,

00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:38.400
otherwise everybody used to write to Me:

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:42.720
'This is wrong with me and that is wrong with my father.

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:47.280
That is wrong with my great-grandmother' and all kinds of things.

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:53.080
That is over now. Much less, I must say, much less.

00:31:53.800 --> 00:32:00.920
But instead of telling Me about people who are sick,

00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:04.440
people who have failed,

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:12.400
people who are still in a state

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:19.680
that cannot be improved, attention should be changed.

00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:25.960
If there's one person who has got cancer anywhere,

00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:30.200
immediately at least ten photographs will come to Me.

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:33.800
Leader will write to Me. The wife's leader will write to Me.

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:39.880
Everybody will write to Me that Mother, say such-and-such thing.

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:48.520
Why? Is that My job?

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:52.880
That person can be cured — we have hospitals —

00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:56.320
can be cured by photographs,

00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:01.640
but attention always goes now to compassion part.

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:07.200
To those people who are so-called suffering physically,

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:11.960
mentally, emotionally, financially,

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:15.040
also in the marriages,

00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:21.040
that's not your job,

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:24.000
neither Mine.

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:28.320
If they're sick, they should take a photograph and work it out.

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:32.920
If it doesn't work, that means that it doesn't deserve.

00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:42.760
There is no need for you to treat them and to work it out and,

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:45.800
if it fails, to write to Me

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:49.400
that 'Mother, such-and-such person is sick.'

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:52.440
What's so important?

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:59.280
Already we have so many healthy people going round.

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:01.640
Why not use them first?

00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:05.960
Our job is not to cure people.

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:11.000
Affection is all right. Compassion is all right. Is a natural thing

00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:17.880
that our attention goes to sick people or to the poor people

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:22.520
or to the people who are suffering,

00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:27.960
but what about Sahaj Yog?

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:34.600
If you have one sick person,

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:38.880
hundred Sahaja Yogis will get after that.

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:42.280
What is the reason?

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:46.360
Is it compassion?

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:48.720
It's not.

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:57.000
They want to prove that they can cure that person.

00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:00.880
Is not compassion.

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:04.320
Compassion today is

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:10.840
to transform human beings into Sahajis,

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:14.640
into good people.

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:18.880
That is the love of Adi Shakti.

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:23.120
Because those who are born have to die in any case.

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:27.440
We should not be unkind, of course, but

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:33.920
our attention should be how many people we are giving Realisation.

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:37.320
Is a very common thing

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:43.080
that people indulge more into so-called curing

00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:48.800
and improving and this. It's all right.

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:54.360
Also there are problems like in the marriages, you see.

00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:57.800
Some marriage couple don't want to be there.

00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:01.400
It's all right. Finish them.

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:06.520
If they don't want to live together, let them.

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:10.960
We have many people who are sensible in this world,

00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:14.920
many people who are healthy in this world.

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:18.440
Now how can you go on struggling with people

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:22.480
who don't want to live together and have problems?

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:25.760
That's not your job.

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:29.000
First of all, you are a spiritual worker.

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:32.320
You are not a social worker.

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:34.040
Of course,

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:39.560
by the way, you can do social work. It doesn't matter, by the way.

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:47.320
But the main thing for you is to transform human beings.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.760
With that, the greatest disease

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:58.600
is of meanness, of cruelty,

00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:06.720
of torturing others, anger.

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:11.400
All these diseases can be cured,

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:15.600
which are internal, not external.

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:18.320
That is today wanted.

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:22.480
Every country's fighting and is tortured

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:29.800
and is in peril all the time of getting destroyed.

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:36.080
The only way you can do it is to give them Realisation.

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:40.840
Now what happens is to be seen very clearly

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:47.080
that when you give Realisation to someone

00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:52.760
and he values it, and he grows into it,

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:57.440
then you are protected.

00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:01.440
You are completely protected.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.800
Who protects you, you may say?

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:08.880
The Adi Shakti, all right,

00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:16.680
but also there is a destructive power working in this world,

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:23.520
not of negativity, but positive destructive power of Shiva.

00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:35.600
If He says that if Adi Shakti's work is going on well, He's happy.

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:39.640
But He's sitting there and watching each and every person,

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:43.480
each and every work of Sahaja Yogis

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:51.960
and if He finds something really very wrong,

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:55.720
I cannot control it.

00:38:55.960 --> 00:39:02.480
He destroys. I cannot go to that point.

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:06.280
He destroys.

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:14.160
Not only destroys, but thousands He can destroy.

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:21.760
Anywhere there is a calamity,

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:28.920
we can say, like an earthquake

00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:33.600
or some sort of a hurricane,

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.600
all these things come

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:43.640
through the working of Shri Mahadeva.

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:48.240
I can't help you there,

00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:54.080
but if you really give Realisation to people,

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:59.440
all these can be averted.

00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:06.400
Of course, it is the whim, I should say, of Adi Shakti

00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:10.960
that She started this work of creating this world,

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:16.280
of creating you and making you Sahaja Yogis,

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:20.800
but your responsibility is also very important.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.680
You cannot be responsible.

00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:40.400
Maybe it was, I felt, My responsibility, but there's a difference.

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:46.600
I never felt it was My responsibility,

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:51.560
never felt this was My job,

00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:54.800
never felt I have to do it.

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:57.440
'I did it.'

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:02.760
That is the work.

00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:07.200
That's the kind of personality you should have.

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:13.240
You have to do it in a very humble manner,

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:19.880
in a very beautiful manner

00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:25.200
and you'll be amazed to see how you are protected,

00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:31.880
how you are supported and how everything works out.

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:35.760
The greatest joy you will get when you will find

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:39.000
you can give Realisation to people.

00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:44.240
You can change their lives.

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:47.240
Never you would feel such joy,

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:55.360
even if you get, say, a big lottery maybe,

00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:59.800
a big job or a big name

00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:06.400
or a very big award, no.

00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:12.560
The joy of creating Sahaja Yogis

00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:18.240
knows no bounds,

00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:22.720
is such a joy-giving thing.

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:28.800
You develop such fraternities,

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:35.000
such solidarity, as they call it, such oneness,

00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:40.240
such enjoyment of love,

00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:43.880
enjoyment of compassion.

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:47.840
It's a different level of enjoyment

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.080
that's not like ordinary enjoyments.

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:57.800
You're not to be afraid of Me,

00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:02.200
but be afraid of yourself.

00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:06.080
Have a watch on yourself and see for yourself

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:09.800
what have you been doing so far.

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:13.200
What have you done so far?

00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:19.680
Because you have been enlightened.

00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:23.400
If the enlightened people

00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:27.400
cannot give light, what's the use in having them?

00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:30.320
Look at these little, little candles.

00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:36.240
Whatever little light they have, they're giving that light.

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:40.360
They're burning themselves to give that light.

00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:46.600
If we cannot give that light,

00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:52.160
what is the use of enlightenment?

00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:58.040
Enlightened doesn't mean the light for yourself only

00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:03.080
the light of love, compassion,

00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:09.960
which is divine, which is not normal, which is not ordinary,

00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:12.880
as you see in the films.

00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:18.400
It is a divine love which works

00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:24.640
and that is what makes Me sometimes little weak

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:28.200
when I hear that Sahaja Yogis now

00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:32.920
are getting involved in money, in cheating.

00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:37.640
I mean, all kinds of criminal activities they do.

00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:41.560
I can't understand. I can't believe it.

00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:45.680
After getting the highest,

00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:51.680
why do you want to go so low as that?

00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:57.520
Because you have not yet felt what you have got.

00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:03.320
You have not realised what you have got.

00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:09.200
And you don't respect yourself.

00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:16.560
Still, if you are on the same line and the same level,

00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:27.440
I must say you have done no justice to Me or to yourself.

00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:31.520
We have to work it out.

00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:35.160
Single-handed, I've done it,

00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:38.920
worked very hard, I must say,

00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:46.240
in the sense that I had to deal with horrible people,

00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:54.960
very unkind, very selfish, very cruel.

00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:58.680
That doesn't matter.

00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:05.120
And such beautiful pearls I have discovered.

00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:10.440
But you must keep your lustre

00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:13.480
and work it out.

00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:20.520
I'll be very happy to know that Sahaja Yoga is spreading

00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:25.320
with leaps and bounds, with great speed

00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:29.200
and that people are really

00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:37.280
getting into that realm

00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:44.720
of peace, joy and happiness.

00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:47.680
That's My dream

00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:51.800
and I hope you all will all work it out.

00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:54.920
Thank you very much.
