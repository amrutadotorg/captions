WEBVTT

03:33.881 --> 03:39.269
It is very, very fortunate and auspicious

03:39.389 --> 03:50.577
that we are celebrating the Diwali in Greece, specially in Delphi.

03:50.697 --> 03:53.607
It has a very ancient history,

03:53.727 --> 04:01.907
and as you know Athena resided here. She was the Primordial Mother.

04:02.027 --> 04:06.300
“Atha” in Sanskrit means “primordial.”

04:06.420 --> 04:14.719
So this place has been described, has been described

04:14.862 --> 04:19.615
even in the Puranas as “Manipur [navel] dvipa [island].”

04:19.735 --> 04:21.845
Manipur is the Nabhi.

04:21.965 --> 04:25.076
Also in Sanskrit Manipur means the Nabhi Chakra.

04:25.196 --> 04:29.000
So it’s described as the Manipur dvipa,

04:29.120 --> 04:32.598
is written “Manipur e dvipa.”

04:32.923 --> 04:36.722
Just imagine these Puranas, these ancient-time books

04:36.842 --> 04:39.083
– God knows how old they are,

04:39.203 --> 04:43.405
must be at least eight thousand or maybe more –

04:43.525 --> 04:46.997
and they have described Greece as the Manipur dvipa,

04:47.117 --> 04:51.789
is the place of Nabhi and where resides the Adi Shakti,

04:51.909 --> 04:53.614
that’s the Athena.

04:53.734 --> 04:56.292
So I mean, how it was known to them

04:56.412 --> 04:59.060
– maybe through torsion area, I would say;

04:59.180 --> 05:02.894
but it is written very clearly, and same we find here

05:03.014 --> 05:09.091
is the place of Athena which is in the Nabhi.

05:11.306 --> 05:15.170
Also Athena is the Primordial Mother,

05:15.290 --> 05:27.984
they say expressed Herself first in the sea on the Nabhi itself.

05:30.381 --> 05:36.085
From there She did all Her work.

05:36.205 --> 05:41.781
Now we can say that in Her movement,

05:42.923 --> 05:52.466
when She came down as existence She created Shri Ganesha

05:52.586 --> 06:02.694
and then She went to the right side and created Mahasaraswati,

06:04.123 --> 06:09.590
the, we can say, the whole universe, all creations She created.

06:09.710 --> 06:11.936
And then She came down,

06:12.459 --> 06:19.677
came down and settled as Kundalini;

06:20.098 --> 06:24.617
but coming down She created Mahalakshmi Principle,

06:24.737 --> 06:29.754
which is for our ascent. This was Her movement,

06:29.874 --> 06:35.269
but it is said that She incarnated in the Nabhi,

06:35.389 --> 06:42.499
because maybe after doing all this She incarnated in the Nabhi,

06:42.619 --> 06:47.210
and also we see that Ganesha’s Kundalini is in the Nabhi.

06:48.860 --> 06:54.145
She incarnated in the Nabhi, they say, because the first pure knowledge,,

06:54.265 --> 07:01.396
pure desire of a person or animal or anybody is hunger.

07:02.158 --> 07:04.317
That is in the Nabhi.

07:04.539 --> 07:13.490
And this hunger She wanted to satisfy or to direct or to handle,

07:14.029 --> 07:19.330
and that might be the reason She might have first come to the Nabhi.

07:20.061 --> 07:24.782
Now this Primordial Mother that we have as Athena

07:24.902 --> 07:33.900
also has in Her hand a Kundalini, also She has one trident.

07:34.210 --> 07:37.208
All this is sign that when She was born

07:37.328 --> 07:40.370
She knew that She has to fight the evil forces

07:40.490 --> 07:42.482
in the Nabhi Chakra.

07:43.752 --> 07:48.252
All this history is really shown very clearly

07:48.372 --> 07:51.540
in the Greek mythology,

07:51.660 --> 07:55.372
but later on this mythology took a very, very wrong path

07:55.492 --> 07:59.004
through human beings, as they know how to spoil everything.

07:59.124 --> 08:04.774
So what they did is to make all the gods and goddesses

08:04.894 --> 08:10.154
look like human beings, and so we have here,

08:14.976 --> 08:18.376
many gods which are in India,

08:19.194 --> 08:23.265
they are represented even in the Greek mythology.

08:23.385 --> 08:28.205
But the Indian gods are kept very pure and really godly and saintly,

08:28.325 --> 08:32.178
but here it was brought down to the level of human beings.

08:32.298 --> 08:34.579
And so many gods who were there

08:34.699 --> 08:40.179
were shown to be little different from Indian gods,

08:40.923 --> 08:43.388
because they made it human.

08:44.762 --> 08:49.189
It’s very surprising how it was deviated

08:49.309 --> 08:51.414
gradually from one to another.

08:51.534 --> 08:56.059
Even in India it’s done but it doesn’t stay,

08:56.179 --> 08:58.340
because we have Puranas.

08:58.460 --> 09:01.836
So every time people try to ruin it and spoil it,

09:01.956 --> 09:05.999
it goes back to the normal state because we have Puranas.

09:06.119 --> 09:11.886
But Puranas are not worshipped like Bible or like Koran

09:12.006 --> 09:14.786
or like any other such religious book,

09:14.906 --> 09:20.134
but they are just relating the history of the ancient times;

09:20.254 --> 09:25.653
and one has to just see it that it is intelligible,

09:25.773 --> 09:29.885
this can be explained, people can know about it.

09:31.956 --> 09:35.474
But the way they have described about Manipur dvipa

09:35.594 --> 09:41.005
was very much really great, and even at the time of Alexander,

09:41.125 --> 09:46.684
Greece was a very prosperous, extremely beautiful state.

09:49.104 --> 09:52.952
Because it is described by Chand Bardai,

09:53.072 --> 09:55.489
one of the poet who came with him here,

09:55.609 --> 09:59.582
and he has described into all details what things are.

09:59.702 --> 10:02.315
And he has also described that there’s a temple

10:02.435 --> 10:10.171
of the Primordial Mother, very clearly, of the Adi Shakti,

10:10.291 --> 10:12.928
and there is the Ganesha is also sitting there.

10:13.048 --> 10:15.682
He has described it in all details.

10:15.802 --> 10:23.105
Also the steps going to the temple are three-and-a-half, he says.

10:23.225 --> 10:26.998
Three are big ones and the last one is half way.

10:27.118 --> 10:33.121
And if you make, extend them to the whole world

10:33.241 --> 10:37.128
it can make a three-and-a-half coils.

10:37.248 --> 10:44.525
Also very clearly he said that there are swayambhu,

10:44.645 --> 10:46.695
swayambhu of Shri Ganesha.

10:46.815 --> 10:49.896
And also about Oracle of Delphi they say

10:50.016 --> 10:54.249
that in the Nabhi Chakra the gods speak.

10:54.369 --> 10:57.636
All this is described in India much before,

10:57.756 --> 11:01.502
much, much before Alexander came to India,

11:02.112 --> 11:04.743
and from that we can understand

11:04.863 --> 11:08.980
that there might have been much more rapport, maybe; maybe

11:09.100 --> 11:12.983
many people were going abroad or maybe coming here,

11:13.103 --> 11:15.761
or may be from the torsion area

11:15.881 --> 11:19.617
that all the Puranas were written down.

11:19.737 --> 11:24.115
So it’s absolutely an ancient place we are in,

11:24.235 --> 11:29.817
which is truthful in its description and everything, no doubt,

11:29.937 --> 11:33.571
but later on the deterioration came, took place.

11:33.691 --> 11:37.177
Also here there is question of Kundalini was there,

11:37.297 --> 11:39.808
and the chakras were painted also.

11:39.928 --> 11:41.825
But when Christianity came they said,

11:41.945 --> 11:43.865
“It’s all bogus, forget it,”

11:43.985 --> 11:46.709
and they didn’t want to see to the other side of it.

11:46.829 --> 11:51.812
And that is how it became just a kind of a history also,

11:51.932 --> 11:55.289
that was not so clean and clear.

11:59.587 --> 12:03.844
The faith in Athena subsided,

12:03.964 --> 12:08.076
faith in all the gods and goddesses also subsided

12:08.196 --> 12:11.283
and it started becoming this, actually we can say

12:11.403 --> 12:14.515
it was disappearing nicely.

12:14.635 --> 12:19.785
This was the situation of this Greece. Now again we are back.

12:19.905 --> 12:23.852
In the “Manipur e Dvipa” we are sitting down nicely,

12:23.972 --> 12:28.642
and for Lakshmi Puja, which is in the Nabhi.

12:28.762 --> 12:32.305
Lakshmi came out of water, no doubt,

12:32.425 --> 12:36.372
but Athena is the Mother of Lakshmi.

12:36.492 --> 12:45.254
She is the One who is all-pervading, and She created Lakshmi,

12:45.374 --> 12:48.349
and this Lakshmi is the One that ruled here

12:48.469 --> 12:53.114
and She was very much manifesting.

12:53.979 --> 12:58.498
And She created beautiful things here,

12:58.618 --> 13:04.237
because they were very rich people, Greeks were very rich;

13:04.357 --> 13:07.553
and they were indulging into all kinds of things,

13:07.673 --> 13:11.418
specially in business, then in shipping.

13:11.538 --> 13:16.350
Shipping is their one of the most important business,

13:16.470 --> 13:21.629
and I came with My husband here because he was a shipping man.

13:21.749 --> 13:24.244
And I was surprised that at the airport

13:24.364 --> 13:28.310
we had the minister’s wife, another minister’s wife,

13:28.430 --> 13:31.797
Prime Minister’s wife. I was surprised, normally they never go

13:31.917 --> 13:35.347
to receive any lady missus who comes.

13:35.467 --> 13:38.097
“No, no,” they said. “You see what happened

13:38.217 --> 13:42.768
that our husbands told us, ‘If you really want to see a lady

13:42.888 --> 13:49.022
who is absolutely, immaculately feminine and very auspicious

13:49.142 --> 13:53.081
and very serene, then it is Mrs. Srivastava.’”

13:53.201 --> 13:56.672
So they came to see Me, imagine them!

13:56.792 --> 14:01.329
The idea of serenity doesn’t exist now for women in the world,

14:01.449 --> 14:03.538
but these ladies came to see Me that

14:03.658 --> 14:06.800
“who is this serene lady who has come?”

14:06.921 --> 14:08.821
And they looked after Me very well,

14:08.941 --> 14:12.499
and then afterwards there was an election coming also.

14:12.619 --> 14:16.702
But I don’t forget the way they told Me and very respectfully,

14:16.822 --> 14:19.570
they said, “How did You develop this serenity?”

14:19.690 --> 14:22.224
I said, “I didn’t develop. It was just existing.

14:22.344 --> 14:27.577
I didn’t do anything to look serene or in any way work it out.

14:27.697 --> 14:29.938
There is no beauty parlor for that

14:30.058 --> 14:33.107
but it is something innate in Me,

14:33.227 --> 14:35.928
what if you think it was serenity.” She said,

14:36.048 --> 14:39.274
“No, no, all the men praised about You that

14:39.394 --> 14:44.111
‘She is a person who is, even in these horrible days,

14:44.231 --> 14:46.758
is extremely serene.’”

14:46.878 --> 14:50.817
Now Diwali is very significant because

14:50.937 --> 14:59.437
today is the darkest day, darkest night and longest night,

14:59.587 --> 15:03.639
and to end it up they put lights.

15:04.425 --> 15:08.822
Now in the atmosphere it’s all very dark, black,

15:08.942 --> 15:13.786
the sun is gone. So they put on all these lights.

15:13.906 --> 15:16.687
In the same way it is Kali Yuga.

15:17.242 --> 15:20.958
Now, Kali Yuga you can consider as one day.

15:21.078 --> 15:25.745
It’s very dark, horrible, it has lots of problems,

15:25.865 --> 15:28.149
it’s made our lives miserable

15:28.269 --> 15:31.251
and we don’t know how to move with life.

15:32.156 --> 15:37.955
At this moment what is necessary is to enlighten people.

15:38.075 --> 15:40.514
Kali Yuga at its worst now.

15:40.634 --> 15:43.994
The kind of things people are doing even in the name of God

15:44.114 --> 15:47.226
is shocking. But that is Kali Yuga,

15:47.346 --> 15:51.753
where we have lost all sense of direction.

15:51.873 --> 15:53.846
We don’t know which way we are going.

15:53.966 --> 15:56.436
All kinds of wrong things we are doing

15:56.556 --> 16:00.496
and we think it’s all right, after all what’s wrong in it?

16:00.718 --> 16:03.823
Everything you tell them – “what’s wrong?”

16:03.943 --> 16:07.862
You tell them, “Don’t do it.” They’ll say, “What’s wrong?”

16:08.052 --> 16:10.673
And that’s how every human being has very,

16:10.793 --> 16:15.097
become very individualistic. In a way he’s not,

16:15.217 --> 16:19.205
because they follow a fashion, they follow a style

16:19.325 --> 16:22.106
– I mean they are not, they are slavish –

16:22.226 --> 16:24.267
but they believe they are very independent,

16:24.387 --> 16:27.061
they are free people, they can do whatever they like.

16:27.181 --> 16:29.954
As a result of this freedom in this Kali Yuga

16:30.074 --> 16:34.545
or the idea of freedom, what has happened with them is that

16:34.665 --> 16:38.543
they have become extremely ugly.

16:38.663 --> 16:44.245
The kind of things they are doing in Kali Yuga is unbelievable.

16:44.365 --> 16:47.341
Even when they are priests, they are in the churches,

16:47.461 --> 16:51.984
this thing, that thing, they become so horribly immoral

16:52.104 --> 16:54.575
that cannot believe how can that be

16:54.695 --> 16:57.984
in the name of God, under this roof of God?

16:58.104 --> 17:01.362
But it has started, that is Kali Yuga.

17:01.941 --> 17:05.915
And this Kali Yuga has to be finished.

17:06.248 --> 17:11.205
So what do we do to remove the darkness of the night

17:11.325 --> 17:13.287
is to put lights.

17:13.407 --> 17:17.060
In the same way people should be enlightened.

17:17.180 --> 17:21.072
There should be light in the heart of people.

17:21.192 --> 17:24.218
Once they’re enlightened, this darkness

17:24.338 --> 17:27.375
from which we are suffering because of our ignorance

17:27.495 --> 17:31.964
will be finished and we’ll have the absolute knowledge.

17:32.084 --> 17:36.751
So this is a new age that they are talking about is here

17:36.871 --> 17:42.268
right now, here, that it is going to work out in such a manner

17:42.388 --> 17:48.033
that it will be all enlightened personalities together,

17:48.153 --> 17:54.763
and they’ll know what is light is, what is real knowledge, gyana.

17:54.883 --> 17:58.649
So ours is a path of knowledge:

17:58.769 --> 18:04.172
knowledge that is love, knowledge that is compassion.

18:04.292 --> 18:06.946
This is what we have to understand,

18:07.066 --> 18:12.647
that we have come into another area, arena, where

18:12.767 --> 18:20.909
all the skirmishes and the troubles of Kali Yuga cannot enter.

18:21.123 --> 18:23.543
It’s raining outside, nothing inside

18:23.663 --> 18:29.123
– it’s like that, that we are now not only free,

18:29.274 --> 18:33.666
but whatever we are doing is nothing but freedom;

18:33.786 --> 18:38.432
where we are not attached to anything that can debase us,

18:38.552 --> 18:42.702
make us lose grip over truth.

18:42.822 --> 18:47.211
When such a personality is brought in then what happens,

18:47.331 --> 18:51.394
that all these ideas of Kali Yuga will disappear.

18:52.116 --> 18:55.988
But I must say, it’s the Last Judgment at the same time.

18:56.108 --> 18:58.626
Those who accept the truth

18:58.746 --> 19:02.806
and reside in truth and grow in truth will remain,

19:02.926 --> 19:06.468
all other will be perished – is said already.

19:06.770 --> 19:11.885
Like you see a garden in which there are some trees

19:12.005 --> 19:18.017
who are nourished well, who get lot of water and love,

19:18.137 --> 19:24.376
and who give also so much to people they exist.

19:24.496 --> 19:27.929
The others are burnt down and finished.

19:28.049 --> 19:32.106
In the same way you have to first accept the love,

19:32.226 --> 19:36.548
take the love, nourish yourself with that love

19:36.668 --> 19:39.583
and then you give to others.

19:39.703 --> 19:48.360
This is a simple way you can overcome the Kali Yuga’s curses.

19:48.787 --> 19:53.731
Kali Yuga is so much full of darkness

19:53.851 --> 19:56.847
that we start hitting each other.

19:57.504 --> 20:00.672
For example you are all sitting here. Suddenly it becomes dark.

20:00.792 --> 20:03.968
You don’t know how to move, whether you are hitting others or not,

20:04.088 --> 20:06.542
with whom are you sitting, nothing, in the same way.

20:06.662 --> 20:10.550
With the darkness in the heart, darkness in the mind

20:10.670 --> 20:14.596
that you don’t know where are you, what are you doing

20:14.716 --> 20:17.162
and what you should be doing,

20:17.282 --> 20:21.976
just like going amok you go on hitting each other.

20:22.096 --> 20:26.745
This is what is Kali Yuga, and the one who recognizes it

20:26.865 --> 20:30.328
and gets out of it is the Sahaja Yogi.

20:30.448 --> 20:33.642
Otherwise you are just like other people

20:33.762 --> 20:36.779
if you are still indulging into the same periphery,

20:36.899 --> 20:43.814
in the same circles of imbalance.

20:45.028 --> 20:47.917
Now another thing with Kali Yuga is this,

20:48.037 --> 20:53.634
that even if you are hit or even if you are destroyed

20:53.754 --> 20:56.730
they just don’t blame themselves.

20:56.850 --> 21:01.082
Is a another horrible temperament one develops

21:01.202 --> 21:04.586
that you blame others, never yourself.

21:04.706 --> 21:08.097
That it is your mistake that you hit yourself.

21:08.217 --> 21:11.967
It was you did wrong and that’s what it is.

21:13.530 --> 21:17.697
This is the, what we call is the illusion, is the bhrama,

21:17.817 --> 21:20.205
and this illusion has to go away.

21:20.325 --> 21:24.346
And for Kali Yuga it is said this is the era of illusions,

21:24.466 --> 21:30.523
and this illusion, if you fall into it you are finished.

21:30.643 --> 21:35.001
But if you see the illusions then you try to seek the truth.

21:35.121 --> 21:38.448
That’s why today the seeking is very strong,

21:38.568 --> 21:41.902
because they can feel it’s an illusion.

21:42.022 --> 21:44.421
It’s not the truth, they know.

21:44.541 --> 21:48.149
And once they know it is not the truth, what do they do?

21:48.269 --> 21:50.133
They want to know what is the truth,

21:50.253 --> 21:53.051
where is the truth and they try to find it.

21:53.171 --> 21:58.451
That’s how also in this Kali Yuga the seeking has started.

21:58.571 --> 22:02.602
The story about Kali Yuga is told in also another Purana,

22:02.722 --> 22:07.843
of Damayanti Purana where Damayanti, the wife of Nala,

22:07.963 --> 22:14.428
was separated from him because of the same illusions created by Kali.

22:15.229 --> 22:25.150
So one day it happened that Nala got hold of this horrible Kali

22:25.270 --> 22:29.556
and he said, “Now I am going to strangle you and finish you off.”

22:29.676 --> 22:31.512
So Kali said, “All right, you can do it,

22:31.632 --> 22:35.275
but first listen to my importance, my mahatmya

22:35.395 --> 22:38.532
– what importance I have, why I am there.”

22:38.652 --> 22:40.099
So he waited.

22:40.219 --> 22:44.796
He said, “Now agree, if you listen to me I’ll tell you.

22:45.264 --> 22:48.245
When I will come and I will rule the world

22:48.365 --> 22:50.586
– means when there will be Kali Yuga –

22:50.706 --> 22:55.408
people will get into bhranti, means illusions.

22:55.528 --> 22:58.487
They will not know whether this is truth or not

22:58.607 --> 23:02.055
and they will then try to seek the truth.

23:02.175 --> 23:06.818
But not only the people, those who go to the jungles

23:06.938 --> 23:10.988
and those who renounce everything;

23:11.314 --> 23:16.336
but there will be another type, the same people who are doing this,

23:16.456 --> 23:23.749
who are doing this kind of seeking will, in the Kali Yuga

23:23.869 --> 23:28.992
will take birth and will be normal householders,

23:29.112 --> 23:33.939
and they’ll get into these illusions of every kind.

23:34.059 --> 23:37.484
And at that time when they get into this illusion,

23:37.604 --> 23:40.784
then only they will start seeking,

23:40.904 --> 23:45.873
realizing that it is untruth, and they will seek the truth

23:45.993 --> 23:48.140
at that time.

23:48.267 --> 23:51.753
At that time only they will get their Self Realization.”

23:51.873 --> 23:54.863
He told very clearly, I mean thousands of years back.

23:54.983 --> 23:58.192
So Kali Yuga is the time

23:58.312 --> 24:01.162
where people can get their Self Realization,

24:01.282 --> 24:04.902
they will know their Self, they will know the truth.

24:05.022 --> 24:09.572
This is said long time back and you can see now it’s happening.

24:09.692 --> 24:12.621
So this was the time meant for that,

24:12.741 --> 24:16.481
because if you are all right like in Satya Yuga and all that,

24:16.601 --> 24:21.086
so you don’t seek; you just accept, you are obedient,

24:21.206 --> 24:22.930
you are good people – finished.

24:23.050 --> 24:29.135
But in Kali Yuga you really start seeking the absolute truth,

24:29.255 --> 24:34.378
and that is why these lights depict that character

24:34.498 --> 24:38.479
or we can say that soul which are being enlightened.

24:38.599 --> 24:44.458
So you are all enlightened souls. For Me that’s the Diwali.

24:44.578 --> 24:48.109
If the people are enlightened that’s the Diwali:

24:48.229 --> 24:52.017
that they remove all the darkness of Kali Yuga

24:52.137 --> 24:57.824
and you all enjoy the beauty and joy of Kali Yuga.

24:57.944 --> 25:01.813
It’s very, very symbolic I should say,

25:01.933 --> 25:05.152
that Diwali has already started.

25:05.272 --> 25:09.750
We have many lights, and we have to get more lights,

25:09.870 --> 25:16.033
not because it is short of light; why are we taking more lights,

25:16.153 --> 25:20.148
why do you want? Because all must be saved.

25:20.268 --> 25:24.671
Our effort is to save everyone of them.

25:24.791 --> 25:26.896
Very difficult, it’s very difficult.

25:27.016 --> 25:32.107
But you can see now how like seeds realized souls go

25:32.227 --> 25:35.683
and plant themselves in very far-fetched places

25:35.803 --> 25:40.241
and there they prosper, become very beautiful trees,

25:40.361 --> 25:45.908
fragrant, and which are giving shade to others.

25:46.028 --> 25:50.080
That’s why you see people from all sorts of places

25:50.200 --> 25:55.512
are being awakened and they become realized souls,

25:55.632 --> 25:58.010
and they awaken others.

25:58.130 --> 26:03.846
Is all the process it’s so well built in,

26:03.966 --> 26:07.843
it looks like that and it’s working out well.

26:07.963 --> 26:11.093
The only thing which is doubtful is,

26:11.213 --> 26:13.603
how many will come to Sahaja Yoga,

26:13.723 --> 26:17.138
and how many we can salvage and save?

26:17.258 --> 26:21.639
Is the only problem and for that you should be prepared,

26:21.759 --> 26:25.895
that every one of you should decide that

26:26.015 --> 26:30.485
“I am going to save at least one soul every day,

26:31.112 --> 26:32.773
one person every day.”

26:32.893 --> 26:37.176
Supposing we are some, we have some people who are getting drowned,

26:37.296 --> 26:43.588
say, in a river or in the sea. What do you do?

26:44.334 --> 26:46.921
You all rush together to save.

26:47.041 --> 26:49.737
You go all out to save his life.

26:49.857 --> 26:52.320
In the same way we have to understand

26:52.440 --> 26:56.346
we have to save the lives of all the people,

26:56.466 --> 26:59.845
and for that we have to work very hard.

27:01.019 --> 27:07.009
Now in this rising from illusion to truth also

27:07.129 --> 27:14.516
we have certain problems which must be faced in a proper way.

27:14.636 --> 27:18.546
One of the problems that arises out of this, as they say,

27:18.666 --> 27:22.692
is the hunger. Hunger could be for money,

27:22.812 --> 27:26.214
could be for food, could be for anything.

27:26.887 --> 27:33.208
Now if there is a hunger for money

27:33.328 --> 27:36.976
is going to settle [in] you permanently

27:37.096 --> 27:43.064
because it is never satiable, you can never satisfy it.

27:43.286 --> 27:50.210
But in the modern times people are just going mad, I tell you,

27:50.330 --> 27:52.611
real mad for money.

27:53.445 --> 27:58.009
They do not care whether others have it or not,

27:58.129 --> 28:01.479
others have this convenience or not,

28:01.599 --> 28:05.085
but just like to show off, they want to show off

28:05.205 --> 28:07.393
– they’re very rich, they’re very good –

28:07.513 --> 28:10.744
and do all kinds of things with all their ego.

28:10.864 --> 28:14.353
They think, “Nothing wrong; what’s wrong? What’s wrong?”

28:14.473 --> 28:17.562
This is one of the biggest hurdles you have,

28:17.682 --> 28:22.424
is that your mind which is ego dictates,

28:22.544 --> 28:29.882
and you try to do it without even verifying

28:30.231 --> 28:32.825
what is this, what is that.

28:34.238 --> 28:38.979
So the mind is under bhranti, in illusion,

28:39.099 --> 28:42.783
and then you have many ways to understand.

28:42.965 --> 28:46.297
So I have said that in Sahaja Yoga

28:46.417 --> 28:49.368
if they want they should get their Realization,

28:49.488 --> 28:56.460
and also they can go about with their shoes anywhere they feel like,

28:56.786 --> 28:59.830
specially on the day they get Realization.

28:59.950 --> 29:01.762
It has worked wonders,

29:01.882 --> 29:04.647
because that day you are in a stronger mood

29:04.767 --> 29:07.156
and you avoid all wrong things.

29:07.276 --> 29:10.809
Now so many of you have grown up in Sahaja Yoga

29:10.929 --> 29:13.185
and are transformed completely.

29:13.305 --> 29:15.648
So very happy to see that.

29:15.768 --> 29:19.794
I haven’t worked like… I have not done much, I don’t think;

29:19.914 --> 29:23.848
I have just enlightened in a way, that’s very far-fetched,

29:23.968 --> 29:25.617
but I don’t do anything.

29:25.737 --> 29:28.616
Without doing anything if you get enlightened and if you say,

29:28.736 --> 29:32.167
“You have done it,” I can’t believe it. How can that be?

29:32.287 --> 29:35.478
I didn’t do anything, just you got your Realization.

29:35.598 --> 29:39.315
But now when I see, then I reflect

29:39.435 --> 29:42.923
and find how beautifully you people sing,

29:43.043 --> 29:47.641
how beautifully you have become sweet

29:47.816 --> 29:52.808
and how beautifully you have become friendly to each other,

29:52.928 --> 29:57.238
I am now convinced, and I feel this won’t take much time

29:57.358 --> 30:00.544
for you to establish Sahaja Yoga.

30:00.774 --> 30:06.367
It is very high time that we should understand that

30:06.487 --> 30:08.609
we have to expose ourselves

30:08.729 --> 30:12.820
to Sahaja Yoga much more often than otherwise.

30:14.193 --> 30:17.518
And you see the other problems are there also.

30:17.638 --> 30:21.233
Like they have some problems, they are saying,

30:21.353 --> 30:25.920
“Mother, there should be some written laws.” I said, “No.

30:26.761 --> 30:30.085
It is through your experience also you can know.”

30:30.205 --> 30:34.496
For example, the other day I said that there’s a Lakshmi Principle.

30:34.616 --> 30:38.786
Now let us see how the Lakshmi Principle goes out.

30:38.906 --> 30:45.437
Very simple, very easy if you want to know, it’s very simple.

30:47.961 --> 30:53.170
Because this Lakshmi is very volatile, chancala [movable].

30:54.373 --> 30:57.051
Once you give a hundred rupees to a servant,

30:57.171 --> 31:00.669
immediately he’ll go to the pub and drink :

31:00.789 --> 31:04.408
the Lakshmi is dead; as soon as you give the Lakshmi,

31:04.528 --> 31:08.369
he tries to go and drink in a pub.

31:08.489 --> 31:12.519
So you can imagine what is the situation is with this Lakshmi.

31:12.639 --> 31:16.774
She is very good but also She tempts you.

31:16.961 --> 31:19.023
She tempts you very much.

31:19.143 --> 31:23.929
So, you see, you have to watch: whatever money you have

31:24.049 --> 31:26.667
you should put in the bank or do whatever you like,

31:26.787 --> 31:31.473
but just don’t spend the whole lot. Just don’t do it.

31:31.593 --> 31:37.591
Secondly you must know also, if all the doors are closed

31:37.711 --> 31:43.439
and you get Lakshmi from one door She will stay, no doubt

31:43.559 --> 31:47.778
She will stay; if you are miserly She will stay,

31:47.898 --> 31:52.640
but She will rot because She has no outlet.

31:53.195 --> 31:56.627
So if you open the other door, you will be amazed

31:56.747 --> 32:00.915
that not only this Lakshmi can go out

32:01.035 --> 32:07.501
but also can get much more air, much more freedom from outside,

32:07.621 --> 32:09.952
because you’ve opened the other door.

32:10.072 --> 32:16.217
With one door you just experiment, nothing comes in it.

32:16.337 --> 32:19.750
You open one door, no air will come, nothing will come in.

32:19.870 --> 32:24.459
But you open the second door, then you will find

32:24.579 --> 32:31.115
that there’s gushing of currents inside the room.

32:31.235 --> 32:36.570
In the same way a person who wants to have money

32:36.690 --> 32:41.144
should first learn to spend whatever money he has.

32:41.264 --> 32:44.481
And in this Kali Yuga this is one of the blessings,

32:44.601 --> 32:50.158
because the job of Kali Yuga is to create doubts,

32:50.278 --> 32:52.890
to create illusions, bhramat

32:53.010 --> 32:57.862
so it will go on creating. But if you stick on to the truth,

32:57.982 --> 33:03.371
then it won’t work out, it won’t work out.

33:03.491 --> 33:07.940
So it is important to understand that all the time

33:08.060 --> 33:10.973
we are under a testing ground.

33:12.202 --> 33:16.043
It is a thing just to be witnessed.

33:16.163 --> 33:20.708
It’s very interesting to see how this Lakshmi

33:20.828 --> 33:24.807
wants to run away from the house of a man

33:24.927 --> 33:31.095
who is only interested in cheating,

33:31.215 --> 33:37.231
interested in grabbing, in telling lies.

33:37.351 --> 33:42.307
So this Lakshmi doesn’t stay with him. She goes away.

33:46.184 --> 33:50.450
All these things are happening around us.

33:50.570 --> 33:56.778
I am not saying this offhand, it’s all there – horrible!

33:56.999 --> 34:01.693
You see it’s to see, we have to clearly see

34:01.813 --> 34:03.910
the movement of your mind.

34:04.030 --> 34:08.270
Where is it going, where is it thinking?

34:08.390 --> 34:12.339
Lakshmi is the One, She makes you think about some things

34:12.459 --> 34:13.817
which you should not think.

34:13.937 --> 34:16.649
As I told you people will start drinking,

34:16.769 --> 34:22.242
they will to go to races, they will drink a lot

34:22.362 --> 34:25.081
– I mean they’ll do everything.

34:25.201 --> 34:29.516
Why? Because they have money, now they must spend somewhere.

34:29.636 --> 34:34.219
But they will put it into things which has no investment

34:36.512 --> 34:42.045
in the real good, in the real achievement.

34:42.165 --> 34:48.025
And that’s how we have now people who are spending so much money,

34:48.145 --> 34:52.126
so much on wasteful things.

34:52.246 --> 34:56.773
So wastefulness can never, never

35:00.420 --> 35:04.567
achieve the goal that is yours;

35:04.687 --> 35:11.285
and the goal that is yours is the fulfillment of your being,

35:11.405 --> 35:19.148
to become the Spirit. It’s very, very subtle to understand.

35:19.268 --> 35:22.220
You think you are doing nothing wrong; what’s that?

35:22.340 --> 35:25.639
– after all, while I am doing something wrong

35:25.759 --> 35:31.757
or something serious, the body should react. But no.

35:32.057 --> 35:36.278
Nothing will react, neither your mind nor your body.

35:40.758 --> 35:47.376
You see, all these years My experience has been very simple,

35:48.027 --> 35:51.483
that there are some Sahaja Yogis still involved

35:51.603 --> 35:54.238
in the Lakshmi Principle:

35:55.000 --> 35:58.248
like they want to cheat Me,

35:58.368 --> 36:01.994
they want to make money out of Sahaja Yoga.

36:02.114 --> 36:06.157
Then there are some people who want to do business among themselves.

36:06.277 --> 36:09.951
All of them have failed very badly,

36:10.071 --> 36:15.899
failed so badly that they are like bankrupts

36:16.019 --> 36:19.161
or they are in jail, and all kinds of things.

36:19.281 --> 36:25.148
So, never do business with a Sahaja Yogi.

36:26.140 --> 36:28.647
For Sahaja Yogi it is very important

36:28.767 --> 36:33.219
not to do any business with the Sahaja Yogis.

36:33.339 --> 36:36.151
If you understand this simple principle

36:36.271 --> 36:38.790
you will not do business with Sahaja Yoga.

36:38.910 --> 36:41.433
Of course you can’t do business with Me also.

36:41.553 --> 36:47.162
So this is a very, very simple thing in which people start doing.

36:47.282 --> 36:50.301
For example they meet, two Sahaja Yogis:

36:50.421 --> 36:57.933
one from say, from Japan, and another from say, America.

36:58.054 --> 37:00.690
And they start saying, “Oh, you are a Sahaja Yogi,

37:00.810 --> 37:05.361
I am also a Sahaja Yogi. Can you give me some, a false paper,

37:05.481 --> 37:08.210
or you can give me some report?”

37:08.330 --> 37:10.105
They go on asking you questions.

37:10.225 --> 37:13.335
“But why? We don’t want. We don’t want to do that.”

37:13.455 --> 37:16.041
They are not interested [in you?], they are interested

37:16.161 --> 37:17.729
in what you have.

37:17.849 --> 37:21.183
And this is something one has to learn

37:21.303 --> 37:27.930
very cleverly and intelligently, when people start

37:28.050 --> 37:32.787
communicating to you about the business part.

37:32.907 --> 37:36.386
In Sahaja Yoga there is no business among themselves,

37:36.506 --> 37:43.033
except they have business with Self Realization.

37:45.041 --> 37:47.997
If you understand this point, small,

37:48.117 --> 37:53.975
the money part of it which is quite illusive will disappear.

37:54.522 --> 37:59.395
It all works out beautifully if you are surrendered,

37:59.515 --> 38:04.665
but otherwise also it can be worked out,

38:04.785 --> 38:07.261
even if you are not surrendered;

38:07.381 --> 38:12.188
because you see the result and you are hurt,

38:12.308 --> 38:16.433
you are troubled, and so you give it up.

38:17.235 --> 38:23.939
So whatever happens, it’s our watching system

38:24.059 --> 38:27.188
– I should say, one of the chakras –

38:27.617 --> 38:32.598
here you can see clearly: by watching.

38:32.718 --> 38:37.012
Clearly you see how much you have gone into trouble,

38:37.132 --> 38:39.059
so you give it up.

38:39.179 --> 38:42.706
But before doing that we have a very good way

38:42.826 --> 38:48.498
of seeing through our vibrations.

38:48.618 --> 38:51.504
You just feel the vibrations and see for yourself:

38:51.624 --> 38:53.766
if the vibrations are good, well and good.

38:53.886 --> 38:56.289
If they are not all right then should know

38:56.409 --> 38:58.178
that there is something wrong.

38:58.298 --> 39:00.653
You can judge any human being you like,

39:00.773 --> 39:04.558
you can judge any pastor or if you want to see any one

39:04.678 --> 39:08.936
of these millionaires and all those things,

39:09.056 --> 39:12.062
but first you must find out:

39:12.182 --> 39:20.924
that one, is he a perfect Sahaja Yogi or not?

39:22.225 --> 39:25.587
This happens with the individuals.

39:25.707 --> 39:28.392
It can happen in the collective also.

39:28.512 --> 39:31.586
I have seen in the collective people are so much misled,

39:31.706 --> 39:34.626
and one negative person immediately knows

39:34.746 --> 39:39.283
who is the other negative, and then he gets hold of that negative

39:39.403 --> 39:42.080
and they start working together.

39:42.906 --> 39:47.919
So you have to be extremely cautious

39:48.039 --> 39:53.472
that you have got your Realization, you’ve got everything,

39:53.592 --> 39:58.318
you’ve got also lot of money in Sahaja Yoga.

39:58.643 --> 40:01.299
With all that you should know

40:01.419 --> 40:08.917
it’s a very, very good sign for thieves to walk in.

40:09.663 --> 40:12.388
So you should be very careful

40:12.508 --> 40:18.815
and don’t get charmed by all these nonsensical things.

40:18.935 --> 40:22.851
That’s what is the protection from your Mother,

40:22.971 --> 40:26.531
that She wants to protect you in this way.

40:26.651 --> 40:36.435
Our whole attitude towards life has to be that of a witness:

40:36.555 --> 40:38.938
you see everything clearly.

40:39.058 --> 40:44.823
Gradually this seeing will become so very sharp,

40:44.943 --> 40:50.478
so clear-cut, so understanding that you will be amazed.

40:50.598 --> 40:57.032
Then you will be using some thing there, anything you are using.

40:58.397 --> 41:01.066
Then you don’t have to think,

41:01.186 --> 41:03.840
only you have to know the vibrations:

41:03.960 --> 41:07.384
what are the vibrations are, what do the vibrations say,

41:07.504 --> 41:10.710
because they are there to guide you.

41:16.519 --> 41:21.413
Those who are not yet very good at vibrations

41:21.533 --> 41:24.437
should try to establish themselves.

41:24.557 --> 41:26.262
If you are not good at vibrations

41:26.382 --> 41:28.444
that means you will not judge people rightly,

41:28.564 --> 41:31.535
nor will they have knowledge properly.

41:31.654 --> 41:35.719
So first you must get your, all your vibrations corrected

41:35.840 --> 41:37.840
and also chakras corrected.

41:37.961 --> 41:45.736
After that you can see what are your associates, who are they?

41:46.561 --> 41:53.356
See actually, your mind now is so enlightened

41:53.476 --> 41:59.075
that you can straightforward see everything before you.

42:00.241 --> 42:03.991
But if you don’t use that enlightened mind

42:04.111 --> 42:09.358
you will be amazed, there are some forces of negativity,

42:09.478 --> 42:12.653
and once these forces start

42:14.272 --> 42:20.965
- You see, actually I should say we are at a juncture now

42:21.085 --> 42:24.277
that these things won’t happen any more.

42:24.397 --> 42:27.318
But when I started Sahaja Yoga it was very bad,

42:27.438 --> 42:32.562
very bad situation, and we had half-baked,

42:32.682 --> 42:42.200
quarter-baked, one-sixteenth-baked people [Laughs].

42:42.320 --> 42:45.460
And I just didn’t know how to tell them,

42:45.580 --> 42:49.473
because if I tell them anything they would just run away.

42:49.593 --> 42:51.491
They would not come to Sahaja Yoga.

42:51.611 --> 42:55.110
While in the other places like gurus, what they do,

42:55.230 --> 42:57.902
they take money and – “bas” (enough), that’s all.

42:58.022 --> 43:00.896
Now people think: ”Now we have given money to the guru,

43:01.016 --> 43:04.630
how can we leave?” Maybe they go on giving money and sticking on.

43:04.750 --> 43:07.206
But in Sahaja Yoga there’s no money involved.

43:07.326 --> 43:11.087
So they come, then they disappear.

43:11.207 --> 43:13.397
Very common; it’s very, very common

43:13.517 --> 43:16.391
that they come for a short time to Sahaja Yoga.

43:16.511 --> 43:21.155
But if they are really special people they just stick,

43:21.275 --> 43:25.398
and start seeing everything from the right angle

43:25.518 --> 43:29.561
because they are enlightened,

43:29.681 --> 43:33.208
they have grown up, they are mature.

43:33.328 --> 43:35.791
So this is how we have to come back

43:35.911 --> 43:42.517
to this horrible night of Kali Yuga through Diwali.

43:42.637 --> 43:44.838
This is what we have to do,

43:44.958 --> 43:51.067
to be humble and to find whether you are all right or not,

43:51.187 --> 43:54.971
whether you are going in the right direction or not.

43:55.091 --> 43:58.132
It is you only who can decide.

43:58.252 --> 44:02.556
With vibrations you can immediately know that you are catching,

44:02.676 --> 44:04.711
or you will know you are right.

44:04.831 --> 44:06.722
Whatever decision has to be taken,

44:06.842 --> 44:11.120
you have to use your hands fully.

44:12.429 --> 44:15.531
It’s not talking that is going to help,

44:15.651 --> 44:20.241
it’s not giving lectures that is going to help – no.

44:24.494 --> 44:30.833
It is through experimenting, through understanding,

44:30.953 --> 44:41.382
through the feelings or the deep, I should say the deep impact

44:41.502 --> 44:46.069
of everything that will communicate to you

44:46.189 --> 44:49.196
what sort of a people they are, what they are talking about,

44:49.316 --> 44:50.934
what you should do.

44:51.054 --> 44:53.445
This could be a little mental,

44:53.565 --> 44:58.974
but later on it becomes absolutely beyond the mental activity.

45:02.337 --> 45:08.719
Now as it is, I said that Kali Yuga is over,

45:08.839 --> 45:11.414
is about to finish.

45:11.534 --> 45:15.688
But still there may be people who will try to go back

45:15.808 --> 45:19.766
to this kind of normalcy, so-called.

45:19.886 --> 45:25.397
But there is a way out for all this, is simple meditation.

45:25.517 --> 45:32.809
With meditation you can achieve whatever is to be achieved,

45:34.031 --> 45:38.270
and then you’ll be surprised that we have been given

45:39.881 --> 45:43.582
very, very important thing to be done.

45:43.702 --> 45:48.192
And the most important thing is to be watchful about yourself,

45:48.312 --> 45:52.649
that I hope you are not falling into the trap of Lakshmi.

45:52.848 --> 45:58.273
The same Lakshmi that decorates you can also disfigure you.

45:59.487 --> 46:04.559
So we have to do everything to keep this beautiful Lakshmi,

46:04.679 --> 46:10.532
this decorated Lakshmi as our ideal, and it works out.

46:13.421 --> 46:21.081
Our aim is this, our ideal is this and we have to do this,

46:21.201 --> 46:28.870
so we can establish the new government, very beautiful government.

46:32.963 --> 46:41.188
Our whole attitude should be such that we have to be alert,

46:41.308 --> 46:43.688
because you become meditative.

46:43.808 --> 46:47.192
As soon as you start thinking about something

46:47.312 --> 46:51.622
you’ll become meditative. Your thinking will go away.

46:51.843 --> 46:56.429
You won’t be able to think, and then you can be lost?

46:56.930 --> 47:02.496
But no, when you are meditative then you cannot be lost. Why?

47:02.616 --> 47:10.443
Because then you have given your life in the hands of truth.

47:10.563 --> 47:16.013
You have given your hand into the hand of reality

47:16.133 --> 47:19.537
and that guides you, that protects you, that watches…

47:19.657 --> 47:23.297
that watches you, that helps you – you can never go wrong.

47:23.417 --> 47:25.595
Even if you are meditative

47:25.715 --> 47:28.117
don’t you worry, nothing will happen to you.

47:28.237 --> 47:34.239
But if you are never meditative, then it’s impossible to save.

47:34.359 --> 47:38.309
It’s impossible to save, it’s impossible to mature;

47:38.429 --> 47:43.571
you have to be very meditative to mature. That’s very important.

47:43.691 --> 47:48.404
I would say that all the Sahaja Yogis here today

47:48.524 --> 47:53.058
are doing this puja, and then there will be also

47:53.178 --> 47:58.376
another puja of enlightenment I have been called, or whatever it is;

47:58.496 --> 48:02.656
but you have to be very, very careful

48:02.776 --> 48:06.116
not to renounce your meditative mood.

48:06.236 --> 48:09.584
What you can do is to watch

48:09.704 --> 48:14.736
how far you have gone, how far you have solved your problems.

48:14.856 --> 48:16.482
As soon as you see that,

48:16.602 --> 48:21.939
immediately you become a complete realized soul.

48:23.757 --> 48:27.488
So the guideline is such that

48:28.106 --> 48:31.870
we should know that we are realized souls.

48:31.990 --> 48:34.509
And what is so important?

48:34.629 --> 48:39.973
Why have we become realized souls? Not only for our desires,

48:40.093 --> 48:43.249
for our pure desires but also for others.

48:43.369 --> 48:46.146
And in that understanding

48:46.266 --> 48:50.036
that we are not only for ourselves but for others,

48:50.156 --> 48:53.210
you become collectively conscious,

48:53.330 --> 48:56.603
and you start helping others.

48:56.723 --> 48:58.352
You’ll stand very well;

48:58.472 --> 49:02.261
otherwise you are lost and the others are also lost.

49:02.381 --> 49:07.266
This way is the way we have to really go ahead,

49:07.386 --> 49:09.603
go ahead towards the truth

49:09.723 --> 49:12.431
and bring that truth for the other people,

49:12.551 --> 49:15.852
for other people, and save them.

49:15.972 --> 49:22.004
This is how you can express your love to them, all your caring.

49:27.812 --> 49:35.080
It is a subject which is very difficult to handle, I think,

49:35.200 --> 49:43.685
because of – I should say that to talk about this subject

49:43.805 --> 49:48.896
is much easier than to assimilate this within ourselves.

49:49.016 --> 49:51.045
So now when you are listening to Me,

49:51.165 --> 49:54.918
please try that you have to meditate afterwards.

49:55.038 --> 49:58.281
In meditation you will assimilate,

49:58.401 --> 50:03.363
and the same power that you think is within you

50:03.483 --> 50:07.164
of discrimination, of giving vibrations,

50:07.284 --> 50:09.769
of doing all kinds of things out of Sahaja Yoga

50:09.889 --> 50:13.669
will be completely, continuously be acting.

50:13.789 --> 50:20.389
But if you do not meditate, if you are somewhere else,

50:20.509 --> 50:23.586
it won’t work out. It won’t work out.

50:24.189 --> 50:26.439
So today is the day to celebrate

50:26.559 --> 50:30.291
and to be happy that we have so many Sahaja Yogis all over,

50:30.411 --> 50:32.283
there is hope for the whole world,

50:32.403 --> 50:37.687
and we can save all people who are lost in the wilderness.

50:37.807 --> 50:39.642
That’s a fact, no doubt.

50:39.762 --> 50:42.765
But after that celebration and everything

50:42.885 --> 50:48.310
we should sit back on the, we can call, on the asanam or anywhere

50:48.430 --> 50:51.381
and watch what is happening;

50:51.501 --> 50:54.906
and you will be amazed that in meditation

50:55.026 --> 50:59.234
you will be revealed with all the beauties you have achieved,

50:59.354 --> 51:02.269
all kinds of things that you have achieved.

51:02.389 --> 51:07.823
And all the worries and botherations of things disappear.

51:07.943 --> 51:10.390
This should happen to you all,

51:10.510 --> 51:14.392
and this is what I request you all to have

51:14.512 --> 51:21.242
this special capacity to understand yourself.

51:23.813 --> 51:29.201
My own hope is fulfilled.

51:31.418 --> 51:36.621
To see you sitting down here I feel overjoyed,

51:37.443 --> 51:40.396
and same way you will also feel

51:40.516 --> 51:48.048
when you all will try to raise the Kundalini of others,

51:48.168 --> 51:50.551
establish them in Sahaja Yoga

51:50.671 --> 51:53.086
– to be amazed what will happen to you.

51:53.206 --> 51:57.549
It’s so joyous to give Realizations to others.

51:57.669 --> 51:59.679
For that you don’t have to do anything,

51:59.799 --> 52:01.937
to pay anything, nothing of the kind;

52:02.057 --> 52:05.142
this power you have which is awakened, that’s all.

52:05.262 --> 52:06.941
I mean, what you have to do is to,

52:07.061 --> 52:09.895
wherever you go you have to just awaken the Kundalini

52:10.015 --> 52:12.658
of the person, give Realization.

52:13.261 --> 52:17.746
Nothing needs to be done. And that’s so joy-giving,

52:17.866 --> 52:20.201
you feel so happy about it.

52:20.321 --> 52:24.711
So today I bless you all with this special power

52:24.831 --> 52:27.834
that you give Realization to people

52:27.954 --> 52:32.729
and look after the Nabhi of the people, and whatever it is.

52:34.134 --> 52:41.363
It is very, very important to understand how far you can go.

52:41.918 --> 52:45.908
We have to change the world, we have to save the world.

52:46.028 --> 52:48.538
It’s your responsibility.

52:48.658 --> 52:52.677
You have got Realization, not the others,

52:52.797 --> 52:55.612
so don’t try to find faults with others.

52:55.732 --> 52:59.307
Think about you, that you have Realization

52:59.427 --> 53:06.240
and it is expected that you should spread Sahaja Yoga.

53:07.533 --> 53:10.758
Thank you very much. May God bless you.

53:10.878 --> 53:14.519
Today, I’m getting so meditative that I don’t know!

53:20.502 --> 53:22.445
May God bless you all.
