02:51:27.969 --> 02:51:33.970
It was really very interesting to go through
various programmes

02:51:33.980 --> 02:51:37.402
coming from different countries.

02:51:37.740 --> 02:51:44.547
I, myself, was overwhelmed that Sahaja Yoga
is spreading to all these countries,

02:51:45.143 --> 02:51:50.039
where they have created such good artists and such
good program.

02:51:51.294 --> 02:51:54.849
We didn’t even feel how the time passed!

02:51:55.487 --> 02:52:00.440
Lastly, the critic –

02:52:01.483 --> 02:52:04.953
of course I always say,
“Don’t criticize others”.

02:52:05.306 --> 02:52:10.639
But specially the art, when people start criticizing,
the art is dying out.

02:52:10.639 --> 02:52:11.792
[Cut in the video]

02:52:11.895 --> 02:52:16.318
...And is now only the critics
are criticizing is a fact.

02:52:17.617 --> 02:52:22.247
If not, the art that will come up will be
so hideous and heinous

02:52:23.161 --> 02:52:30.288
that we’d can never enjoy that art, because it will be
only for money, cheap type,

02:52:31.296 --> 02:52:34.906
which can be sold in the market.

02:52:35.817 --> 02:52:39.597
And this kind of intellectual analysis of
everything

02:52:40.243 --> 02:52:44.898
is responsible also to the decline of pure art.

02:52:45.824 --> 02:52:47.979
We are doing it all the time.

02:52:48.482 --> 02:52:58.526
We all think we are very intelligent and we
can criticize, all the time correcting these artists

02:52:59.053 --> 02:53:00.119
It’ a common thing.

02:53:00.119 --> 02:53:06.184
It’s not only artists, but in every field
of life we have become very much arrogant,

02:53:06.184 --> 02:53:11.293
and we think we know everything and we can
criticize others.

02:53:11.469 --> 02:53:14.451
By which we stop their progress completely.

02:53:15.109 --> 02:53:20.371
Not only that, but we also stop our progress.

02:53:20.705 --> 02:53:30.048
Because whatever you do with your mind, is not in any way global, in any way spiritual.

02:53:30.902 --> 02:53:37.620
So this mind has to be left alone and you
have to go beyond the mind.

02:53:37.987 --> 02:53:43.434
So many of these artists have done work through
their torsion area,

02:53:43.434 --> 02:53:44.979
I can see that.

02:53:44.979 --> 02:53:52.989
Because they are so much spiritually developed
that they can do this kind of a work.

02:53:53.257 --> 02:54:00.582
But when we start criticizing them, because
people are not at all anywhere near torsion area,

02:54:01.068 --> 02:54:04.349
and they don’t understand the beauty
of torsion area,

02:54:04.349 --> 02:54:06.009
they start criticizing.

02:54:06.141 --> 02:54:11.979
By that they are bringing down the level of
high-class art.

02:54:12.137 --> 02:54:15.828
Artists are, of course, very much strangled.

02:54:16.049 --> 02:54:20.544
But also, other areas where we are,

02:54:20.767 --> 02:54:25.410
we think it from the point of view of only money.

02:54:25.674 --> 02:54:33.517
And ultimately you find that even that point
or that aim fails.

02:54:33.918 --> 02:54:41.593
Because after all, even money, which is the
Lakshmi principle, has to have the art.

02:54:41.759 --> 02:54:47.876
If you don’t have the art of money, you
are absolutely a useless fellow!

02:54:47.979 --> 02:54:55.966
I hear of so many people, today they are earning
so much and tomorrow they are, just become bankrupt.

02:54:56.121 --> 02:55:02.218
How is it happening? What is the problem is that we don’t understand the art of money also.

02:55:02.665 --> 02:55:05.602
Everything is an art in a way,

02:55:05.602 --> 02:55:12.066
life also is an art –
that is you have to make everything look very beautiful,

02:55:12.503 --> 02:55:16.912
very sensible, balanced and energy-giving.

02:55:17.059 --> 02:55:26.611
Here now, I saw some very nice paintings behind,
of Shri Ganesha, done so perfectly well,

02:55:27.229 --> 02:55:29.974
in every angle, in every way.

02:55:30.429 --> 02:55:34.732
And it is so joy-giving to see such a nice painting.

02:55:34.805 --> 02:55:41.680
Instead of taking the joy out of that,
people start putting it into words.

02:55:41.979 --> 02:55:48.039
In the words, they get lost and we can never
see the beauty and the poetry behind that painting.

02:55:48.544 --> 02:55:57.079
Same about poetry, same about literature,
same about all those things which are poured out of your heart.

02:55:58.249 --> 02:56:04.635
As I said, even the money: if it has no heart
behind it, it’s a horrible stuff.

02:56:04.842 --> 02:56:12.087
And you just can’t bear to see such money,
it’s so gross, it’s so ugly, you can’t bear it!

02:56:12.385 --> 02:56:16.569
So, in everything that you do, there has to
be your heart.

02:56:16.569 --> 02:56:19.980
Without the heart, whatever is done has no meaning.

02:56:20.142 --> 02:56:27.418
You just, through your mental capacity, go on
criticizing everyone, go on saying things about everyone.

02:56:27.580 --> 02:56:37.847
But how much do you enjoy, how much do you
get that inside you, is only possible through your heart

02:56:38.200 --> 02:56:44.319
which must be open, which must
be great, and which must be enjoying.

02:56:44.671 --> 02:56:50.730
So, for all of us Sahaja Yogis, it’s quite
an eye-opener when we see this.

02:56:51.179 --> 02:56:56.348
Because I have seen even in Sahaja Yoga people are very
critical of each other, sometimes.

02:56:56.672 --> 02:57:02.206
Saying that, “You should not have done this,
you should not have done that”. It’s not your lookout.

02:57:02.674 --> 02:57:07.767
You do it properly and others will also do it.
There’s no ritualism in Sahaja Yoga.

02:57:08.029 --> 02:57:11.189
One thing one should know, there is no blind ritualism.

02:57:11.336 --> 02:57:15.656
But all rituals, that so-called are there, are
from the heart.

02:57:16.200 --> 02:57:21.155
If your heart is open, you will do all the
rituals in a very sweet manner

02:57:21.155 --> 02:57:26.096
and the – I would say, result-oriented.

02:57:26.560 --> 02:57:33.292
Otherwise, whatever you do with such a mental
tension, and thinking what are you doing wrong or right,

02:57:33.667 --> 02:57:36.810
you can never achieve any ascent with that.

02:57:37.236 --> 02:57:43.289
I’m very, very happy, very much satisfied,
and - I don’t know what to say - enamoured

02:57:43.289 --> 02:57:48.311
to see so many people, from so many countries,
are Sahaja Yogis.

02:57:48.414 --> 02:57:54.488
And such good artists and such beautiful people.

02:57:55.090 --> 02:57:59.093
I didn’t know Sahaja Yoga would be everywhere
so fragrant,

02:57:59.369 --> 02:58:02.325
but to see all this, you don’t know how joyous I felt.

02:58:02.708 --> 02:58:12.679
I mean, compared to my – I should say – efforts,
it is too much, really, it is too much.

02:58:12.899 --> 02:58:19.518
And like a little seed becomes beautiful flowers,
I see all of you coming up here,

02:58:19.518 --> 02:58:24.029
and showing this talent – not only the talent, but the
talent of Sahaja [Yoga].

02:58:24.426 --> 02:58:26.096
May God bless you all.

02:58:26.096 --> 02:58:28.086
With all my heart, I bless you.
