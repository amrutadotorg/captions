1
00:00:52,788 --> 00:00:58,444
I hope you enjoyed yesterday’s puja
very much.

2
00:01:10,072 --> 00:01:16,695
Today I wanted to talk to you about
certain matters

3
00:01:16,896 --> 00:01:20,926
where people get quite confused.

4
00:01:23,147 --> 00:01:27,725
There are certain things we must understand
in Sahaja Yoga.

5
00:01:27,926 --> 00:01:33,814
First point there is no fundamentalism
in Sahaja Yoga.

6
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:41,256
Nobody should use My words or say:
‘Mother said so’, nobody should.

7
00:01:41,457 --> 00:01:45,393
That is how all this hierarchies have been
built,

8
00:01:45,594 --> 00:01:49,985
in the churches, everywhere. Everybody
can read, everybody can find out.

9
00:01:50,186 --> 00:01:57,737
There is no way of controlling people
by saying: ‘Mother said so’.

10
00:01:58,245 --> 00:02:04,015
That shows that you are trying to use
My Words to tell people off.

11
00:02:04,216 --> 00:02:07,560
You are not in charge.

12
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:21,667
If I say something in the program
of Sahaja Yogis,

13
00:02:21,868 --> 00:02:29,888
I say it because it is heart to heart talk
between My children and Myself, you see.

14
00:02:30,089 --> 00:02:33,727
And it should not be just sent over

15
00:02:33,928 --> 00:02:40,528
through your computers all over the world
without consulting, without censoring

16
00:02:40,729 --> 00:02:45,905
it by the leader. There’s no haste
in Sahaja Yoga.

17
00:02:46,106 --> 00:02:50,840
So that should not be done. Now this
I have said, definitely.

18
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:55,696
Whatever I’ve said nobody remembers,
only they use My Name.

19
00:02:55,897 --> 00:03:04,066
Mother said so in 1970. In 1970 I never
spoke in English.

20
00:03:10,925 --> 00:03:21,539
So all this historical utterances should
not be used. We live in the present.

21
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:26,864
That time maybe, the situation was such
I might have said something,

22
00:03:27,065 --> 00:03:30,982
but today the situation is different.

23
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:35,721
Maybe because Sahaja Yogis were just
coming to Sahaja Yoga,

24
00:03:35,922 --> 00:03:40,436
maybe they needed some sort of a guideline.

25
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:45,869
It’s a journey, first of all. It’s
a journey.

26
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:52,402
You are passing, supposing passing through
a slope,

27
00:03:52,603 --> 00:03:56,103
then you have to use a different type
of method.

28
00:03:56,304 --> 00:04:01,999
Now you are walking on a plain land,

29
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:07,918
then you don’t behave as if you are
climbing a mountain.

30
00:04:08,119 --> 00:04:13,567
So it’s a journey, journey of Sahaja Yoga
to our destination.

31
00:04:13,768 --> 00:04:18,720
The destination is that we have
to emancipate

32
00:04:18,921 --> 00:04:24,523
maximum number of human beings
into Sahaja Yoga.

33
00:04:27,404 --> 00:04:31,493
But that should not be taken over. I again
tell you,

34
00:04:31,694 --> 00:04:35,868
nobody should take over things from
the leaders.

35
00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:40,378
I have appointed the leaders just
to co-ordinate with you people,

36
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:45,365
but you have a direct, always a direct
relationship with Me.

37
00:04:45,566 --> 00:04:55,303
So far all these people who believed in God
had no direct connection,

38
00:04:56,502 --> 00:05:01,963
but now you have: so why not use Me?

39
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:09,098
And if there are leaders,

40
00:05:15,532 --> 00:05:19,081
you have to ask the leaders.

41
00:05:19,282 --> 00:05:25,146
Nobody should take things upon themselves
and start preaching people.

42
00:05:25,347 --> 00:05:32,909
We don’t like preaching. We have had enough
of it.

43
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:36,355
There’s no need to preach other, if you
have to preach, preach yourself,

44
00:05:36,556 --> 00:05:39,177
but not to others.

45
00:05:39,378 --> 00:05:44,450
One has to understand that it’s a living
process.

46
00:05:47,331 --> 00:05:55,051
We can understand from a cell at the end
of a root.

47
00:05:55,252 --> 00:06:03,979
It has intelligence, it is completely
in control of itself

48
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:11,032
and it has a direct connection with
the Divine Power.

49
00:06:11,233 --> 00:06:16,193
So it moves by itself, but the attention
is on the collective,

50
00:06:16,394 --> 00:06:21,267
collective means the tree. It moves in such
a direction,

51
00:06:21,468 --> 00:06:26,411
that there is no argument, there is no
quarrelling,

52
00:06:26,612 --> 00:06:32,311
in the sense there is no obstacle, moves.

53
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:40,779
Now supposing, there is a big obstacle,

54
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:46,592
like a stone, it goes round it, encircles
it many-a-times

55
00:06:46,793 --> 00:06:50,689
for the future tree that has to come.

56
00:06:55,395 --> 00:07:00,559
So from the past what do you get,

57
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,377
is the relative idea as to where you have
reached.

58
00:07:04,578 --> 00:07:11,393
And from the future you have to know
how far you have to go.

59
00:07:13,727 --> 00:07:19,583
This is very important to understand because
these things creep into the western mind

60
00:07:19,784 --> 00:07:24,826
very easily. They don’t want to have direct
relations with Me.

61
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:28,745
That’s how then you’ll start forming
groups.

62
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,971
One person will stand up: ‘Mother says so.’
Finished.

63
00:07:33,172 --> 00:07:38,978
One tent is raised. Another one say:
‘Mother says so.’

64
00:07:39,179 --> 00:07:46,192
Somebody will use My tapes. Anything.
There’s no need at all for you

65
00:07:46,393 --> 00:07:51,224
to get to these things and listen to them.

66
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:55,817
If they want to create something, they
should talk to Me directly,

67
00:07:56,018 --> 00:08:00,505
and not to do it themselves on their own,

68
00:08:00,706 --> 00:08:05,039
which is a very wrong attitude towards
Sahaja Yoga.

69
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,437
So first of all, we must know it’s a living
process.

70
00:08:09,638 --> 00:08:15,916
You cannot put on it artificial types
of things,

71
00:08:16,117 --> 00:08:20,706
which will curb the growth of Sahaja Yoga.
It’s very important to understand.

72
00:08:20,907 --> 00:08:27,404
There where I find that people don’t
understand Sahaj Yoga.

73
00:08:27,605 --> 00:08:32,657
You cannot mould into any pattern.

74
00:08:32,858 --> 00:08:38,143
It moulds by itself. Works by itself.

75
00:08:39,582 --> 00:08:44,988
So we cannot have any hierarchy, never.

76
00:08:45,189 --> 00:08:52,989
These hierarchies ultimately become
a barrier between you and Me,

77
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:59,852
which I don’t like. All the leaders are
told that whatever letters you get,

78
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:03,750
whatever things you have, you should send
it over to Me.

79
00:09:03,951 --> 00:09:08,651
I would like to see them Myself. But
sometimes they do,

80
00:09:08,852 --> 00:09:12,664
some of the leaders, specially in Australia
I had a very bad experience.

81
00:09:12,865 --> 00:09:18,069
But now you have a very wise leader here,
and a very sensible person.

82
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,024
I don’t think there’s anything wrong
with him.

83
00:09:20,225 --> 00:09:24,264
Only thing, I think he’s rather too mild
sometimes with some people.

84
00:09:24,465 --> 00:09:29,217
He should have told. Yesterday I had
to suffer so much because of two ladies,

85
00:09:29,431 --> 00:09:34,149
because he never told them how horrible
they were.

86
00:09:35,593 --> 00:09:39,941
So I had to absorb all their nonsense
quite a lot.

87
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:47,151
Because if a leader is not mild, you’ll sit
on his head.

88
00:09:47,352 --> 00:09:51,898
If he’s little strict, you’ll get after
him.

89
00:09:52,517 --> 00:10:01,325
Only thing one has to realize, that
everything is a living process,

90
00:10:01,526 --> 00:10:09,989
and through some sort of a coordinator
Mother is trying

91
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:16,045
to work out, in a more simpler manner.

92
00:10:16,246 --> 00:10:22,760
For example if everybody writes to Me
for a small little thing...

93
00:10:22,961 --> 00:10:26,123
I mean, they write for everything, I must
tell you.

94
00:10:26,324 --> 00:10:30,133
Absolutely something so useless
sometimes that I really laugh.

95
00:10:30,334 --> 00:10:37,262
There’s no need to ask Me like: ‘Mother,
we cannot get Indian spices here’.

96
00:10:46,251 --> 00:10:52,762
All these stupid things. Then second is
about the husbands or about the wives.

97
00:10:52,963 --> 00:10:58,005
Because you should not see those films
or those televisions,

98
00:10:58,206 --> 00:11:04,256
which if you see invariably show the fight
between husband and wife.

99
00:11:04,478 --> 00:11:07,289
So if you go on seeing that you will learn,
you’ll pick it up.

100
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:12,238
It’s like a parrot, you know. You pick up
all the words which are to be said

101
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:19,239
to your husband, harsh words, or to your
wife, and then you work it out that way.

102
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:24,472
And so many questions could have been
easily solved.

103
00:11:24,673 --> 00:11:32,622
I think, to work out the marriage is only
question of a woman, not so much of man.

104
00:11:32,823 --> 00:11:37,418
Normally men don’t want to marry, normally.

105
00:11:38,129 --> 00:11:42,562
Though they have no responsibility, they
don’t have to produce children, anything.

106
00:11:42,763 --> 00:11:45,984
But still they don’t want to marry.

107
00:11:46,185 --> 00:11:52,300
They are sort of little bit afraid also,
in the west specially, not in India.

108
00:11:52,501 --> 00:11:59,226
In India men want to marry because they
get somebody who will spoil them,

109
00:12:00,694 --> 00:12:07,942
who will never answer them, listen to them,
be humble. So they want to have,

110
00:12:08,143 --> 00:12:11,388
see they marry. But here in the west I’ve
seen men don’t want to marry.

111
00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:17,663
One fellow I told him that you have to get
married, he disappeared for three days.

112
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:28,579
So this marriage problem... we have to have
marriages.

113
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:33,213
But this marriage problem comes when
women don’t know how to adjust,

114
00:12:33,414 --> 00:12:40,698
mainly, I must tell you. The first thing is
you have to really spoil your husbands.

115
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:46,248
Actually, they should entirely depend on you
for everything.

116
00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:49,770
Then what will they do?

117
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:55,655
But in a loving manner. Not in
an oppressive manner.

118
00:12:55,856 --> 00:13:00,075
Do not demand anything. Do not expect
anything.

119
00:13:00,276 --> 00:13:04,812
Just be gentle, kind, express your love.

120
00:13:05,013 --> 00:13:08,106
Then they get used to it, they can’t live
without it.

121
00:13:08,307 --> 00:13:11,913
These tricks should have told to you by
your parents, but they might have been

122
00:13:12,114 --> 00:13:18,280
 the same as you are, so you don’t know
the tricks of the trade.

123
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:36,708
After marriage we have to say: ‘We are,
we’. Shouldn’t say: ‘I’.

124
00:13:36,909 --> 00:13:43,332
And also understand, you see, men are
different from women. They are different.

125
00:13:43,578 --> 00:13:48,168
You are the preserver of the society.

126
00:13:48,565 --> 00:13:52,687
They are the creator, but you are
the preserver,

127
00:13:52,888 --> 00:13:57,853
and you have to have much more patience
and compassion which you have, no doubt.

128
00:13:58,054 --> 00:14:01,003
You must take to your feminine qualities

129
00:14:01,204 --> 00:14:06,239
and you’ll be amazed that you are shakti,
for men.

130
00:14:08,396 --> 00:14:13,966
You are the power for men. That’s why men
must respect women.

131
00:14:14,167 --> 00:14:18,559
If they don’t respect women, not their
romanticism and nonsense,

132
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:24,426
but as personality. If they don’t respect,
then they suffer every way.

133
00:14:24,627 --> 00:14:27,474
Specially materially.

134
00:14:28,212 --> 00:14:33,908
Materially they suffer and also
reputation-wise.

135
00:14:35,594 --> 00:14:40,006
Some women are extremely demanding
and expecting too much.

136
00:14:40,207 --> 00:14:46,743
Perhaps maybe they see those pictures
of Romeo, Juliet and things like that.

137
00:14:49,749 --> 00:14:57,164
But if you see Romeo, Juliet, you will see
what Shakespeare wanted to communicate.

138
00:14:57,365 --> 00:15:01,988
He was an avadhuta. He wanted
to communicate that these are all

139
00:15:02,189 --> 00:15:05,752
futile enterprises.

140
00:15:06,726 --> 00:15:09,912
Both of them died.

141
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:15,447
They could never enjoy companionship.

142
00:15:16,285 --> 00:15:20,395
We had so many problems like this
in England also,

143
00:15:20,596 --> 00:15:26,949
so I told them: ‘What books you read?’ Most
of them read books of romance, all right,

144
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:33,013
but romance before marriage. There are no
books about romance after the marriage,

145
00:15:33,214 --> 00:15:36,184
can you imagine?!

146
00:15:37,183 --> 00:15:40,512
So naturally, there’s a problem.

147
00:15:40,713 --> 00:15:47,039
After marriage is quarrelling, before
marriage romance. So why marry?

148
00:15:50,972 --> 00:15:57,185
And when I said that man is the head
of the family,

149
00:15:57,386 --> 00:16:00,494
it doesn’t mean that man should dominate
a woman. Never.

150
00:16:00,695 --> 00:16:07,057
You interprete also, sometimes I think,
some of the brains are other way round.

151
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:10,232
What I was saying that he is head
of the family.

152
00:16:10,433 --> 00:16:15,584
Supposing I say he is your leader. That
doesn’t mean that he should dominate you.

153
00:16:15,785 --> 00:16:22,327
If head of the family start dominating, if
the brain of the body starts dominating

154
00:16:22,528 --> 00:16:27,957
what will happen to this body? It’s stupid
to conclude like that.

155
00:16:28,158 --> 00:16:31,975
But you are the heart of the family.

156
00:16:32,188 --> 00:16:37,269
Brain can die, but heart dies the last.

157
00:16:38,324 --> 00:16:41,075
So try to understand, there should be
a complete integration

158
00:16:41,276 --> 00:16:44,491
between heart and brain.

159
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:51,355
And children are the attention,
in the society of Sahaj Yoga.

160
00:16:51,561 --> 00:16:59,419
So here, how can you have such an idea
that if I say the head,

161
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:03,976
then he dominates the heart. How can it?

162
00:17:04,177 --> 00:17:10,097
So they pick up few words from here and
there and use it for justifying

163
00:17:10,298 --> 00:17:14,573
their own weaknesses in Sahaj Yoga.

164
00:17:14,774 --> 00:17:18,912
But this kind of escape is not going
to help you to rise.

165
00:17:19,113 --> 00:17:23,721
You are going against yourself, is not
for your benevolence.

166
00:17:23,922 --> 00:17:30,836
What I’m telling you, is that if you try
to accept all these outdated ideas

167
00:17:31,037 --> 00:17:36,308
in Sahaj Yoga, you’ll go down, you’ll rot.
No use coming to Sahaj Yoga.

168
00:17:36,509 --> 00:17:43,641
We are fresh, we are new and we are living.

169
00:17:43,871 --> 00:17:49,235
We don’t accept these kind of ideas about
men or women.

170
00:17:49,436 --> 00:17:53,741
But when I said that man is the head
of the family,

171
00:17:53,942 --> 00:17:59,050
that doesn’t mean that you dominate your
wife and torture her.

172
00:18:00,478 --> 00:18:10,170
Nor does it mean that the leaders should
dominate, never.

173
00:18:10,371 --> 00:18:15,418
They should never dominate. They should
use their wisdom, their love, compassion

174
00:18:15,619 --> 00:18:19,656
and guide you in a proper way.

175
00:18:21,542 --> 00:18:26,570
I’ve received a letter which is very funny,
that one leader’s wife -

176
00:18:26,771 --> 00:18:33,987
not the leader - the wife,  forbid one of
the Sahaj Yoginis not to come to the house

177
00:18:34,188 --> 00:18:41,546
and to the program because I could not go
to her house. Can you imagine?

178
00:18:41,747 --> 00:18:46,731
This is absurd. Now if I tell her, she’ll
be more harsh on that person.

179
00:18:46,932 --> 00:18:52,776
But by doing that, she doesn’t know how
much she’s missing points in Sahaj Yoga.

180
00:18:52,977 --> 00:18:57,844
I mean, I’m a whimsical person. I can go
anywhere I feel like.

181
00:18:58,045 --> 00:19:01,439
But she should have taken the blame
upon herself,

182
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,870
if she thinks I did not go to her house,
instead of on the another person.

183
00:19:06,071 --> 00:19:13,622
Also, there’s a thing that:

184
00:19:14,578 --> 00:19:17,479
‘This is my house’.

185
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:23,244
This is the biggest nonsense. ‘Mother
should come to my house’.

186
00:19:23,421 --> 00:19:29,309
With Indian specially, it’s too much.
‘Please come to my house, Mother.

187
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:35,258
Come and have dinner with me’. Who are you?

188
00:19:35,678 --> 00:19:41,714
You are a Sahaj Yogi. So your house is
Mine, you are Mine, everything is Mine.

189
00:19:41,915 --> 00:19:45,476
What is there to come to your house?
Then you separate.

190
00:19:45,677 --> 00:19:51,986
This is also an Indian mind, I must
confess. ‘My house’.

191
00:19:52,187 --> 00:19:56,377
This is nonsense, all your houses are Mine.

192
00:19:56,578 --> 00:20:01,095
If I go there, it doesn’t mean that I love
you more than anybody else.

193
00:20:01,296 --> 00:20:05,746
Doesn’t mean that. I have to go somewhere,
you know.

194
00:20:11,516 --> 00:20:15,517
Like somebody asked Me: ‘Why did you take
your birth in Christian religion?’

195
00:20:15,718 --> 00:20:19,649
I said: ‘I had to take My Birth somewhere’.

196
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:23,545
But better was for Christians because
Christians are absolutely fundamentalists

197
00:20:23,746 --> 00:20:28,395
mentally. Mentally they are absolute
fundamentalists. Mentally.

198
00:20:28,596 --> 00:20:33,316
That’s more dangerous. Muslims you can make
them out they are fundamentalists

199
00:20:33,517 --> 00:20:37,251
because they do not have that finesse
about them.

200
00:20:37,452 --> 00:20:44,991
Openly they are fundamentalists, but
Christians are very great fundamentalists.

201
00:20:46,742 --> 00:20:51,707
But they go into somebody’s house now
is becoming a problem for Me.

202
00:20:51,908 --> 00:20:54,735
Because if I go to somebody’s house that
person gets the ego:

203
00:20:54,936 --> 00:20:58,355
‘Oh, She came to my house’.

204
00:21:01,278 --> 00:21:07,010
So again you are not to say that: ‘Mother,
this is my house.

205
00:21:07,211 --> 00:21:09,969
Mother, this is your house’. If I go there
well and good,

206
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:14,559
if I don’t go there well and good, what
does it matter?

207
00:21:17,745 --> 00:21:23,212
Now again I tell you, nothing has to be
sent through your IBM or anything

208
00:21:23,413 --> 00:21:31,339
without the consultation and censoring
by the leader.

209
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:36,209
It can land Me into great difficulties and
tomorrow I could be in jail.

210
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:41,258
Why don’t you understand? I mean, you write
whatever you feel like.

211
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:47,869
So this kind of irresponsible behaviour is,
I can’t understand,

212
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:51,600
and things I never said also can be said.

213
00:21:51,801 --> 00:21:56,986
This shows immaturity and haste.

214
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:06,597
Such things should be consulted, and use
your discretion. Main thing is discretion.

215
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:15,505
What you need to consult your leader
which are vital, important.

216
00:22:17,033 --> 00:22:24,033
Specially things which are written down
and published, things which circulate,

217
00:22:24,234 --> 00:22:29,644
is extremely important to be seen by
the leaders.

218
00:22:29,845 --> 00:22:35,582
There is no hurry about it. Any book
written,

219
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:39,751
any tapes to be released, anything,

220
00:22:39,952 --> 00:22:47,144
should be done with the complete consent
and understanding of the leader.

221
00:22:47,345 --> 00:22:51,430
I would say, the leader must sign those
papers.

222
00:22:51,631 --> 00:22:54,702
Then I can hold him responsible.

223
00:22:54,903 --> 00:23:01,451
But if you are arbitrary and start doing
things, then it could be dangerous.

224
00:23:01,652 --> 00:23:05,432
Simple things I’ll tell you what,
they asked Me: ‘Mother,

225
00:23:05,633 --> 00:23:09,623
what do you think of starting a Vishwa
Nirmala Dharma in Melbourne?’

226
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:14,721
I said: ‘All right’. I didn’t know that
it’s going to be an association.

227
00:23:14,922 --> 00:23:16,839
There is going to be an election and all,
nothing.

228
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:22,385
Just I said: ‘All right, just to start is
all right’.

229
00:23:22,663 --> 00:23:25,352
Vishwa Nirmala Dharma is everywhere,

230
00:23:25,553 --> 00:23:31,482
but they don’t have any association,
nothing. It’s just a kind of a society,

231
00:23:31,683 --> 00:23:36,390
which is just spreading Vishwa Nirmala
Dharma.

232
00:23:39,016 --> 00:23:44,859
There is no sort of a, any organization
about it.

233
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:51,084
We only have Trust, and we don’t want
to have any electioning or all that.

234
00:23:51,285 --> 00:24:00,111
Again if some wrong type of people get in,
then Sahaja Yoga will be ousted completely.

235
00:24:00,876 --> 00:24:03,202
So you can only have Trust,

236
00:24:03,403 --> 00:24:07,658
and if you want to do something else
you can form it separately,

237
00:24:07,859 --> 00:24:15,605
but it should not be Vishwa Nirmala
Dharma or Sahaj Yoga. Nothing doing.

238
00:24:17,167 --> 00:24:21,001
Because I said: ‘Yes’ that doesn’t
mean that you should go that far

239
00:24:21,202 --> 00:24:28,575
with forming this, that association, and
all that. It’s a news to Me.

240
00:24:31,991 --> 00:24:38,812
All right, whatever has been done, has to
be rectified. Absolutely to be rectified.

241
00:24:39,013 --> 00:24:46,707
And we have to bring it down to a proper
level, and should be there people,

242
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:55,182
who should be elected as good people
who are in Sahaj Yoga,

243
00:24:55,563 --> 00:25:00,759
who have so far have been doing everything
in a straightforward manner

244
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:07,070
and who have been very very sensible
about it.

245
00:25:10,157 --> 00:25:17,990
There’s also a suggestion that we should
project ourselves to outside things.

246
00:25:19,228 --> 00:25:27,079
If it means that we have to go to other
organizations, is wrong.

247
00:25:27,451 --> 00:25:30,002
All these organizations are dead
organizations,

248
00:25:30,203 --> 00:25:35,229
they are not living organizations. But if
they want to come to us, all right.

249
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:38,946
But we should not go and break our heads
with them,

250
00:25:39,122 --> 00:25:45,508
because you’ll land up not only with
opposition, but you will catch from them,

251
00:25:45,709 --> 00:25:49,871
negativity. Try to understand.

252
00:25:50,371 --> 00:25:56,922
We don’t have to grow that fast that we get
all the lunatics in Sahaj Yoga.

253
00:25:57,123 --> 00:26:05,406
We have to be very careful. You can only
have Sahaja Yogis who are

254
00:26:06,413 --> 00:26:11,006
seekers, who are honest, who are humble,

255
00:26:11,207 --> 00:26:17,265
who do not want any money or power,
out of Sahaj Yoga.

256
00:26:18,434 --> 00:26:21,847
It will grow. It has grown, just imagine.

257
00:26:22,048 --> 00:26:27,163
Two people came from Australia and see how
many are there.

258
00:26:27,364 --> 00:26:35,111
 It will definitely grow, no doubt, but do
not try to organize it.

259
00:26:36,487 --> 00:26:46,035
You cannot organize. Once you start
organizing, then the growth can be stunted.

260
00:26:46,607 --> 00:26:53,188
Like you have seen bonsai. Bonsai, when
they cut it and organize it,

261
00:26:53,365 --> 00:26:59,143
it becomes a small tree, but I haven’t seen
any tree which grows,

262
00:26:59,344 --> 00:27:03,789
if it is organized grows more, never.

263
00:27:06,935 --> 00:27:10,950
At the most you can nourish it, at the most
you can water it,

264
00:27:11,135 --> 00:27:15,470
at the most you can see the needs of this,

265
00:27:15,889 --> 00:27:18,856
but you cannot just

266
00:27:21,792 --> 00:27:26,228
make it grow more.

267
00:27:27,447 --> 00:27:32,372
All organizations cut the growth.

268
00:27:38,071 --> 00:27:42,833
In the beginning, it may look that by
organizing it, it has increased.

269
00:27:43,034 --> 00:27:49,951
We can say Christianity, what is this?
Like a pumpkin, has no meaning.

270
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:55,734
Absolutely empty hollow nonsense. Like
Islam. Another nonsense.

271
00:27:56,011 --> 00:28:02,248
I mean they admit that Islam is different
from Muslims.

272
00:28:04,354 --> 00:28:10,406
It is being admitted now. What is Buddhism?
Another nonsense.

273
00:28:10,607 --> 00:28:15,564
So this kind of an artificial growth if you
want, you can take to artificial methods.

274
00:28:15,765 --> 00:28:21,758
We really want substantial people,
substantial dharma,

275
00:28:21,959 --> 00:28:25,243
innate within ourselves.

276
00:28:25,444 --> 00:28:30,849
We don’t have to take to these artificial
things.

277
00:28:31,539 --> 00:28:36,847
We are using lots of artificial manure now,
and people are revolting against it

278
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:42,598
because they think that all these
artificial things are harmful to us.

279
00:28:42,884 --> 00:28:48,152
So allow it to work out through the grace
of this Divine Power

280
00:28:48,353 --> 00:28:52,975
in a more natural manner than putting
artificial organizations,

281
00:28:53,176 --> 00:28:55,846
artificial this and that.

282
00:28:56,047 --> 00:28:59,008
I think, some of you must have been
to Harvard or something

283
00:28:59,209 --> 00:29:03,925
to learn how to grow the business, and
that’s how you try to grow,

284
00:29:04,126 --> 00:29:08,110
but ultimately comes to recession.

285
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:22,252
All those, who had education in Harvard,
are responsible all over the world,

286
00:29:22,453 --> 00:29:26,066
and all over the world there is recession.

287
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:30,325
I think, this university should be closed
down.

288
00:29:54,561 --> 00:29:57,731
[Hindi: Shri Mataji says something about
the glass.]

289
00:29:57,932 --> 00:30:03,915
So now, regarding your children.

290
00:30:05,335 --> 00:30:14,275
I have been really studying the nature
of western children.

291
00:30:14,982 --> 00:30:18,727
Now the nature of western children is,

292
00:30:18,964 --> 00:30:24,277
that their attention is never on the right
things.

293
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:32,525
Not on studies.

294
00:30:34,517 --> 00:30:37,769
I should say, not at all on studies.

295
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:43,746
Now, on food yes.

296
00:30:43,947 --> 00:30:48,991
Like in England they asked for baked
beans in the morning.

297
00:30:49,192 --> 00:30:54,801
Now these horrible tinned baked beans,
which you have been giving to them,

298
00:30:55,002 --> 00:31:00,876
are not at all suitable for Indian climate
and they are no good.

299
00:31:01,077 --> 00:31:05,381
You see, if you see a western health
of a person,

300
00:31:05,582 --> 00:31:08,871
I mean, when you go to India you get
diarrhea.

301
00:31:09,072 --> 00:31:13,085
You cannot stand heat, you cannot stand
cold,

302
00:31:13,286 --> 00:31:21,858
anything that changes, you feel so much
the sickness.

303
00:31:22,059 --> 00:31:28,986
Apart from that, all the time you are
tired. You must introspect.

304
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:31,947
Little work you’ll do and you are tired.

305
00:31:32,148 --> 00:31:36,548
I mean, you see in the films or anywhere
I’ve seen, even in the television,

306
00:31:36,749 --> 00:31:39,225
they’ll come and sit down, huhh.

307
00:31:39,426 --> 00:31:44,729
What work have they done, God knows.
All the time, huhh.

308
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:50,238
What is the reason? The reason is to think
too much.

309
00:31:50,439 --> 00:31:52,620
Same with your marriages.

310
00:31:52,821 --> 00:31:55,742
You start thinking: ‘What are my
priorities, what should I do?

311
00:31:55,943 --> 00:32:00,923
Start analyzing. Just do it what you want
to do.

312
00:32:01,124 --> 00:32:13,423
This thinking too much is responsible
for your susceptibility to diseases.

313
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:19,824
Of course, Mooladhara is one of the most
important chakra, no doubt.

314
00:32:20,025 --> 00:32:24,451
If the Mooladhara is weak, you can catch
any disease,

315
00:32:24,652 --> 00:32:33,310
for example: cancer, aids, schizophrenia,
yuppies disease,

316
00:32:33,511 --> 00:32:40,592
also the secret diseases, herpes and all
these things are very common in the west.

317
00:32:40,793 --> 00:32:47,684
But not in India, very few, because of
a strong Mooladhara.

318
00:32:47,885 --> 00:32:54,550
So now, first problem is how to strengthen
your Mooladhara?

319
00:32:57,837 --> 00:33:05,421
The second one is the kind of food you are
eating here is not so fresh.

320
00:33:05,622 --> 00:33:11,614
Try to eat fresh food. At least
in Australia you can get it,

321
00:33:13,416 --> 00:33:17,708
as far as possible. Take to more
carbohydrates,

322
00:33:17,909 --> 00:33:22,840
if you are thinking too much, best is
to take to carbohydrates.

323
00:33:22,986 --> 00:33:26,152
You are so much worried about putting on
weight

324
00:33:26,353 --> 00:33:32,551
or this thing. I don’t know why you want
to be skinny. What is the need?

325
00:33:33,822 --> 00:33:39,746
On the contrary, a person who has little
plumpness, absorbs vibrations much better.

326
00:33:39,947 --> 00:33:48,431
But do you know that vibrations sit on the
fat? Medhastitha - they sit on the fat.

327
00:33:48,632 --> 00:33:52,015
And that’s why they go on the nerves

328
00:33:52,216 --> 00:33:58,366
because nerve is made of fat. Your brain
is also made of fat.

329
00:33:58,885 --> 00:34:05,174
So this new idea of having mosquitoes
around...

330
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:09,398
Sometimes, you know, I get frightened
in a way,

331
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:14,826
I think, next moment that person is going
to fall on the ground.

332
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:21,884
So whatever is pumped into your head,
you accept.

333
00:34:22,085 --> 00:34:30,509
That’s why the entrepreneurs are definitely
controlling you. You have no idea!

334
00:34:32,176 --> 00:34:35,037
Because we don’t have that wisdom to see.

335
00:34:35,238 --> 00:34:40,900
Now they said: ‘All right, you shouldn’t
put any oil in your head, all right?

336
00:34:41,069 --> 00:34:48,136
Never put any oil.’ So you become bald.
So they can sell wigs.

337
00:34:52,001 --> 00:34:58,231
All such things are there. You can put oil
before,

338
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:02,116
previous night, just to make your hair

339
00:35:02,317 --> 00:35:07,798
grow properly, you must give them
nourishment. Why do you starve them?

340
00:35:09,859 --> 00:35:12,943
What’s wrong with oil I just don’t
understand?

341
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:17,254
You must massage your body also with oil.
It’s very important.

342
00:35:17,455 --> 00:35:26,441
Sometimes, Saturday if you use oil
to massage your body, is a very good idea.

343
00:35:27,028 --> 00:35:31,763
Also massage your head, you must look
after yourself.

344
00:35:32,244 --> 00:35:35,108
But just because there’s a fashion not
to put oil,

345
00:35:35,309 --> 00:35:39,702
so you just not have any oil anywhere near.

346
00:35:40,189 --> 00:35:43,841
They all used to put oil if you see films
about say

347
00:35:44,026 --> 00:35:46,372
thirty years back, they were all nicely…

348
00:35:46,573 --> 00:35:50,771
Nobody had dry hair, all shining nice hair.

349
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:55,194
They were supposed to be quite
good-looking.

350
00:35:55,551 --> 00:35:58,164
And this bhootish type of hair then,
when you have,

351
00:35:58,365 --> 00:36:03,984
all the bhoots will take over because
they’ll think: ‘This is the head for me’.

352
00:36:09,657 --> 00:36:16,491
So try to understand what is good for your
body,

353
00:36:17,824 --> 00:36:24,074
and what you should do. Massaging your body
is a very good thing.

354
00:36:24,275 --> 00:36:29,054
I think, without oil I cannot exist,
really.

355
00:36:29,255 --> 00:36:35,094
Because My work is on Sahasrara and if
I starve My Hair,

356
00:36:35,295 --> 00:36:41,309
either I’ll become completely bald or mad;
one of the two.

357
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:47,550
It’s very soothing to massage your hair,
very soothing for your nerves, everything,

358
00:36:47,751 --> 00:36:50,336
and you are realized souls, there’s
vibrations flowing.

359
00:36:50,537 --> 00:36:54,072
You should massage your head nicely.

360
00:36:54,273 --> 00:37:02,000
Take about an hour, on a Saturday. Saturday
is the day of shani, is the day of Saturn,

361
00:37:02,201 --> 00:37:07,965
the day of Shri Krishna. He is so fond
of butter and oil.

362
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:14,292
All these small small things should be
understood.

363
00:37:14,453 --> 00:37:19,113
Also you people are very fond of sun, I can
understand that.

364
00:37:19,314 --> 00:37:25,063
But I don’t know why in Australia you are
so fond of sun, when it is so much?

365
00:37:25,654 --> 00:37:31,791
But because it’s a fashion in the west,
we are all going to the sun, to the sea

366
00:37:31,992 --> 00:37:36,802
and spoiling your skin. Your skin cannot
have the glow,

367
00:37:37,003 --> 00:37:42,541
while you see, if you do not

368
00:37:44,326 --> 00:37:47,893
use sun bathing as some sort of
a treatment.

369
00:37:48,094 --> 00:37:53,262
It’s all right, there’s lot of sun, you can
move about.

370
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:58,760
Indians used to wonder about the English,
and there was a saying

371
00:37:58,961 --> 00:38:03,340
 that an Englishman and a mad dog
in the sun.

372
00:38:03,541 --> 00:38:06,843
Even a sane dog won’t go.

373
00:38:12,106 --> 00:38:14,936
All such things should be understood.

374
00:38:15,137 --> 00:38:21,296
Personal hygiene also has to be seen.
Use lot of water to wash your hands,

375
00:38:21,497 --> 00:38:28,002
and when you are using toilets, water
should be used every time. Very important.

376
00:38:28,203 --> 00:38:32,423
Otherwise, your Mooladhara can never be
all right.

377
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:39,730
Your children, I’m surprised, they don’t
want to brush their teeth.

378
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:44,419
And if you tell them you have to brush,
they start crying.

379
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:47,949
If you tell them you have to have a bath,
they start crying. Imagine, in that

380
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:53,841
sweltering heat of India, they don’t want
to have a bath and they smell.

381
00:38:54,042 --> 00:38:59,902
But when you tell them: ‘Our parents also
smell like that’.

382
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:03,427
Their mouths smell.

383
00:39:03,792 --> 00:39:07,723
In India at least twice we must brush,

384
00:39:07,924 --> 00:39:12,411
once in the morning, once in the evening.
Minimum.

385
00:39:12,612 --> 00:39:17,603
Evening time, we all brush our teeth,
in India.

386
00:39:19,214 --> 00:39:21,861
Is very important.

387
00:39:22,166 --> 00:39:25,646
Now these are such small small things,
which I think,

388
00:39:25,847 --> 00:39:30,211
our culture in India has already taught us
long time back.

389
00:39:30,412 --> 00:39:33,210
I mean we don’t have to tell anyone like
that, they’ll say, "What are you telling us

390
00:39:33,411 --> 00:39:38,862
this nonsense". But they should be fond
of doing this,

391
00:39:39,063 --> 00:39:44,308
so the way is that when your children are
growing, you take them in the bathroom,

392
00:39:44,509 --> 00:39:48,739
make a fun out of it: 'Now let’s see,
we’ll brush our teeth.

393
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:52,650
You brush your teeth I’ll brush my teeth.
Now see whose are whiter', like that.

394
00:39:52,851 --> 00:40:01,270
Make a fun out of it. You are the one who
can teach them good hygiene. Then bathing.

395
00:40:01,698 --> 00:40:09,075
All these little little things are very
important for you and for your children.

396
00:40:09,228 --> 00:40:13,514
So the hygiene part is very poor, personal
hygiene.

397
00:40:13,715 --> 00:40:17,735
Of course, your house is very very clean,
absolutely.

398
00:40:17,936 --> 00:40:21,185
If anything falls on the carpet,
immediately you’ll pick it up,

399
00:40:21,386 --> 00:40:23,957
because this carpet maybe sold later on.

400
00:40:24,158 --> 00:40:27,806
Whatever is saleable, you look after.

401
00:40:28,007 --> 00:40:32,038
Now your teeth also can be saleable,

402
00:40:32,257 --> 00:40:38,341
you need not neglect them, but you will
not be careful.

403
00:40:38,542 --> 00:40:42,318
Whatever is saleable, you’re very careful,
your house - very careful,

404
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:48,315
your carpets - very careful, but whatever
is not saleable,

405
00:40:48,678 --> 00:40:51,713
is not worth anything.

406
00:40:51,914 --> 00:40:58,850
Now in Sahaj Yoga, we should know that
nothing is saleable.

407
00:40:59,533 --> 00:41:04,996
Whatever we have and own, we’ll keep it
with ourself or give it to our children,

408
00:41:05,197 --> 00:41:09,975
or give it as presents to others. You are
not going to sell anything.

409
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:13,523
Everybody is a seller.

410
00:41:14,609 --> 00:41:18,845
House is to be sold, very particular about
the house.

411
00:41:19,046 --> 00:41:23,038
If something goes wrong, you’ll shout
at children. We were surprised

412
00:41:23,239 --> 00:41:26,293
that these children were more careful about

413
00:41:26,494 --> 00:41:31,924
nonsensical things like carpets than their
teeth.

414
00:41:32,511 --> 00:41:35,691
Something fell down on the carpet,
immediately they all rushed

415
00:41:35,892 --> 00:41:39,695
and cleaned the carpet so we started
wondering what’s the matter with them.

416
00:41:39,896 --> 00:41:45,210
That’s not their job. That’s the training
they have.

417
00:41:46,176 --> 00:41:49,925
Whatever is saleable, they try to put right.

418
00:41:50,126 --> 00:41:53,052
So we must change our mind and say that:

419
00:41:53,253 --> 00:41:55,825
‘Whatever we own, we are not going
to sell it,’

420
00:41:56,026 --> 00:42:01,014
or sometimes you have to sell the house,
all right, but it’s not so important.

421
00:42:01,215 --> 00:42:03,241
In any way,

422
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:08,488
whether the house is clean or dirty, you’ll
fetch the same price, that’s My experience.

423
00:42:08,689 --> 00:42:13,095
Whether you decorate or not, on the
contrary, undecorated houses they like,

424
00:42:13,296 --> 00:42:16,748
because of their ego, very surprising.

425
00:42:16,962 --> 00:42:22,336
We had bought a house, in Hounslow,

426
00:42:22,537 --> 00:42:26,516
and one side belonged to one of
the Sahaja Yoginis, one side to Me.

427
00:42:26,717 --> 00:42:29,033
I had no time to decorate or anything,

428
00:42:29,234 --> 00:42:32,485
and she, poor thing, spent so much money
to decorate it and all that,

429
00:42:32,686 --> 00:42:37,167
and some people lived also. Of course, she
made little money out of it, whatever it is.

430
00:42:37,368 --> 00:42:41,452
But My house sold for a higher price
than hers.

431
00:42:41,653 --> 00:42:46,644
Why? They said: ‘It’s already done, we
can’t do anything about it’.

432
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:57,745
So also the ego is there, that we should
be able to do something, in the house.

433
00:42:58,481 --> 00:43:02,707
And thus, it doesn’t make difference.

434
00:43:02,908 --> 00:43:06,645
In any way, they don’t pay for your carpets
and don't pay for your thing.

435
00:43:06,846 --> 00:43:14,290
But people are so particular about their
furniture, about everything.

436
00:43:17,389 --> 00:43:21,870
So now, this is what is materialism.

437
00:43:26,913 --> 00:43:30,469
Is absolute materialism,

438
00:43:31,635 --> 00:43:37,648
that we try to get things just for selling
off.

439
00:43:40,793 --> 00:43:49,647
On the contrary, we have to look out, what
are the beautiful things made by hand.

440
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:56,145
What can we have, whatever is made by hand
by people.

441
00:43:56,346 --> 00:44:04,584
Can have few, and that can be given
to your children, to the progeny.

442
00:44:06,952 --> 00:44:12,650
Also sometimes, the idea of antique…

443
00:44:12,851 --> 00:44:19,155
Who is this child? Please take away.
Who is the child? Who is the child crying?

444
00:44:21,052 --> 00:44:27,484
You must find out why the child is crying
in My Program. Must be something wrong.

445
00:44:27,757 --> 00:44:32,790
Must be some baddha. If a child cries
in My Presence

446
00:44:32,991 --> 00:44:39,755
or is afraid, that means there’s some sort
of a baddha, which you should try to remove.

447
00:44:41,625 --> 00:44:46,090
So now, we have to change our attitude
towards ourselves.

448
00:44:46,291 --> 00:44:50,219
We are specially blessed people, we have
to look after our body,

449
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:53,447
look after our children. We have to look
after things,

450
00:44:53,648 --> 00:45:00,527
which are of much greater importance than
material things, that is the spirit.

451
00:45:00,728 --> 00:45:02,953
So ultimately, we come to the point

452
00:45:03,154 --> 00:45:07,869
that the spirit which has given us all
this beauty,

453
00:45:08,111 --> 00:45:12,388
which has given us such moonlight
in our life,

454
00:45:12,589 --> 00:45:17,073
such sunshine in our work,

455
00:45:17,834 --> 00:45:21,479
she has made us so sweet.

456
00:45:22,915 --> 00:45:32,611
After all, what we have done for the spirit
to satisfy it, to enjoy it?

457
00:45:32,812 --> 00:45:37,568
So the most important thing for us
is our spirit,

458
00:45:37,769 --> 00:45:41,542
and we should seek the comfort of
the spirit.

459
00:45:41,776 --> 00:45:46,582
The more you think about your spirit,
the deeper you’ll go,

460
00:45:46,783 --> 00:45:52,031
and the joy you’ll get will be also very
deep, and you’ll settle down,

461
00:45:52,232 --> 00:45:56,468
very nicely embedded in spirituality.

462
00:45:56,730 --> 00:46:06,727
So you have to, all the time think: ‘Am I
doing this for my spiritual growth?’

463
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:12,649
I mean, in a place like England people get
up at four o’clock to meditate.

464
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:16,314
Nothing doing. This time there was
a big number.

465
00:46:16,515 --> 00:46:20,632
I told so many English that, 'You have been
coming every time to Ganapatipule.

466
00:46:20,833 --> 00:46:23,910
Can you not reduce your number?' They felt
very sad.

467
00:46:24,111 --> 00:46:26,684
‘Mother, we need it. We have to.’

468
00:46:26,885 --> 00:46:29,825
But I said: ‘This time you can avoid, there
are so many people coming.

469
00:46:30,026 --> 00:46:32,326
If we have too many people...’, because
about

470
00:46:32,527 --> 00:46:35,910
hundred and fifty people came from other
countries, you see,

471
00:46:36,111 --> 00:46:41,819
who were not even paying and who were not
such Sahaja Yogis.

472
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:45,146
So I said, 'We have to work it out with
them'.

473
00:46:45,347 --> 00:46:48,925
They said: ‘Mother, but we can’t help it.

474
00:46:49,126 --> 00:46:53,933
We have to be there. We can’t do without
it.’

475
00:46:55,894 --> 00:47:00,344
So this kind of understanding, I’m so happy
that you all

476
00:47:00,545 --> 00:47:08,297
managed to come all this way here and you
are settled so well.

477
00:47:08,498 --> 00:47:16,900
You are living in tents and enjoying this
discomfort because you have got

478
00:47:17,101 --> 00:47:22,600
the comfort of your heart, comfort of your
spirit.

479
00:47:22,801 --> 00:47:27,487
So as it is we have suddenly come up,
very high up,

480
00:47:27,688 --> 00:47:30,712
and whatever I said yesterday was not
in any way

481
00:47:30,913 --> 00:47:34,414
to pamper your vanity but the truth. I just
told you the truth.

482
00:47:34,615 --> 00:47:41,780
It’s truth for at least ninety-five percent
people of Sahaj Yoga.

483
00:47:41,981 --> 00:47:47,590
But they should also go deeper and deeper
and enjoy themselves

484
00:47:47,791 --> 00:47:55,122
and enjoy the collectivity. Now in general,
I can talk to you about things,

485
00:47:55,323 --> 00:48:01,283
that firstly that you have to ask your
leaders if you have to do

486
00:48:01,484 --> 00:48:08,624
anything extraordinary. Now is your
discretion.

487
00:48:14,675 --> 00:48:19,784
And the last but not the least is this:
all the leaders complain

488
00:48:19,985 --> 00:48:26,001
that no one wants to pay any money
whatsoever for Sahaj Yoga.

489
00:48:26,202 --> 00:48:30,345
Now you see, actually, as you know that,

490
00:48:30,546 --> 00:48:36,575
whatever money you give Me for pujas,
I buy silver for you,

491
00:48:36,776 --> 00:48:46,567
and you are given the equal amount of
silver as one would give to Europeans.

492
00:48:47,427 --> 00:48:51,796
But as far as the puja money is concerned,

493
00:48:51,997 --> 00:48:55,284
it’s very low. First they used to just give
Me one dollar.

494
00:48:55,485 --> 00:49:00,014
Of course, that was all in coins, which
I have brought it back,

495
00:49:00,215 --> 00:49:07,520
but otherwise whatever is there, is… I’m
not using it for Myself, I don’t need it.

496
00:49:07,721 --> 00:49:14,525
I should normally, because it’s given to Me,
but I just thought, that instead of that,

497
00:49:14,726 --> 00:49:20,052
if I give you silver, you will have silver
for puja, which is very important,

498
00:49:20,253 --> 00:49:24,663
and that it will be very auspicious.

499
00:49:28,326 --> 00:49:36,353
But the way people want to pay is rather
reluctant.

500
00:49:36,734 --> 00:49:41,291
I agree that you people are now running
into problem about money,

501
00:49:41,492 --> 00:49:44,667
but maybe one of the reasons may be that.

502
00:49:44,868 --> 00:49:50,568
Do you know you pay the lowest in the whole
world? No one pays so low as that.

503
00:49:50,769 --> 00:49:58,291
At least, they pay twenty-one and eleven,
even in India. Minimum.

504
00:49:58,492 --> 00:50:02,642
So whatever it is, whatever suits you,
I’m not going to say anything.

505
00:50:02,843 --> 00:50:06,520
Whether you collect less or more, I’m going
to give you the silver

506
00:50:06,721 --> 00:50:10,349
because you are so many people, and I have
to do that.

507
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:16,918
I always put the maximum amount between
you and Europe.

508
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:25,743
You are also a continent, as Europe is, but
one has to understand, that at least,

509
00:50:26,558 --> 00:50:30,623
we should really think of doing something
for Sahaj Yoga.

510
00:50:30,824 --> 00:50:34,202
What can we do for Sahaj Yoga?

511
00:50:34,957 --> 00:50:40,334
As you know very well, that I’ve used My
husband’s money quite a lot,

512
00:50:40,535 --> 00:50:44,432
and again I’m going to work out something
in Australia,

513
00:50:44,633 --> 00:50:51,406
because I think in Australia it will be
very good for people,

514
00:50:51,841 --> 00:50:57,024
and I can involve My money with them.
But despite all that,

515
00:50:57,225 --> 00:51:01,480
people don’t understand that why My husband
allows Me to do that,

516
00:51:01,681 --> 00:51:06,826
because he knows it gives him all
the blessings.

517
00:51:07,824 --> 00:51:12,846
He told Me many-a-times, he told group
of people, he told openly to Sahaj Yogis

518
00:51:13,029 --> 00:51:21,663
that: 'All these awards I’ve got because
of my Wife, but She is working for God'.

519
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:26,357
But I wanted to say also you donated a lot
of money.

520
00:51:27,142 --> 00:51:32,815
It’s the generosity and if you donate, then
you get it also from another thing.

521
00:51:33,016 --> 00:51:39,609
But I don’t want it for My Personal thing
at all, but is a sign of your generosity.

522
00:51:39,810 --> 00:51:42,876
That is a common thing from all
the leaders...

523
00:51:43,077 --> 00:51:47,828
Melbourne leader says that nobody wants
to pay.

524
00:51:48,114 --> 00:51:50,850
Only they want to take advantage of Sahaja
Yoga.

525
00:51:51,051 --> 00:51:56,754
This is not a very good thing from Lakshmi
point of view.

526
00:51:56,955 --> 00:52:04,508
Also one has to understand that once you
joined Sahaj Yoga,

527
00:52:04,709 --> 00:52:09,822
whether you pay or not pay or anything,
you think you are a liability,

528
00:52:10,023 --> 00:52:14,937
that’s very wrong also. For every small
thing they want help.

529
00:52:15,138 --> 00:52:18,702
Of course, they are to be helped. We try
to help people who are,

530
00:52:18,903 --> 00:52:23,060
who haven’t got money or who are… but they
become sort of liabilities

531
00:52:23,261 --> 00:52:28,558
and then they expect so much from other
Sahaj Yogis,

532
00:52:28,759 --> 00:52:33,805
or from Me also, that one can’t understand,
I mean.

533
00:52:34,006 --> 00:52:38,876
You marry someone, then that person becomes
a headache:

534
00:52:39,077 --> 00:52:44,031
letters after letters, telephones after
telephones.

535
00:52:45,455 --> 00:52:52,372
Is not proper. Of course, some child is
sick, all right, you can inform Me.

536
00:52:52,573 --> 00:52:58,505
But a child is hot-tempered, is
misbehaving, is on My Head.

537
00:52:58,706 --> 00:53:04,433
Maybe you have been hot-tempered, maybe
you are fighting with your wife

538
00:53:04,634 --> 00:53:08,680
or your wife is fighting with you, may be
that. Why not correct that part?

539
00:53:08,881 --> 00:53:13,754
Even the smallest thing they think, should
be done by Sahaja Yoga.

540
00:53:13,955 --> 00:53:18,185
Sahaja Yoga must look after this thing,
Sahaja Yoga must do that.

541
00:53:18,386 --> 00:53:22,727
So one should understand that to you Sahaja
Yoga as a liability,

542
00:53:22,928 --> 00:53:26,450
not you are a liability to Sahaja Yoga.

543
00:53:26,651 --> 00:53:31,856
That’s the best attitude. Of course,
in a way you are a liability.

544
00:53:32,057 --> 00:53:35,473
But what should be your attitude? Now
you’re matured enough.

545
00:53:35,674 --> 00:53:40,204
When the son grows up and matures, then
he looks after the parents.

546
00:53:40,405 --> 00:53:43,232
 In the same way, you have to look after
the Sahaja Yoga,

547
00:53:43,433 --> 00:53:52,010
than Sahaja Yoga looking after you all the
time and pestering Sahaja Yogis about it.

548
00:53:53,209 --> 00:53:59,157
This has to be understood very well, that
Sahaja Yoga is not liable for you.

549
00:53:59,338 --> 00:54:03,458
You are liable for Sahaja Yoga. Sahaja Yoga
has given you so much.

550
00:54:03,634 --> 00:54:09,295
God has done so much for you, what have
we done for God? Always think like that.

551
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:15,153
If you start thinking like that, the more
work you put in for Sahaja Yoga,

552
00:54:15,354 --> 00:54:20,573
the more you exert your mind for Sahaja
Yoga,

553
00:54:20,893 --> 00:54:27,892
in a proper living, balanced manner,
the more you are helped,

554
00:54:28,093 --> 00:54:34,816
the more you grow, the more you enjoy.
It’s like that.

555
00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:42,784
And so, today’s lecture is for all of you
in a way,

556
00:54:42,985 --> 00:54:46,676
because I don’t know what applies to whom.
But you should not put it on somebody else,

557
00:54:46,877 --> 00:54:49,899
but take it for yourself

558
00:54:50,724 --> 00:54:59,073
that we are not going to be liabilities
on Sahaja Yoga, but a support.

559
00:55:00,304 --> 00:55:03,668
We have to look after Sahaja Yoga,

560
00:55:05,955 --> 00:55:10,343
which is a very, very beautiful attitude.
That’s My attitude is.

561
00:55:10,544 --> 00:55:13,704
I don’t need Sahaja Yoga at all.

562
00:55:14,418 --> 00:55:18,836
Not at all. Why do I need? I don’t have
to do Sahaja Yoga.

563
00:55:19,954 --> 00:55:24,208
But I am worried about Sahaja Yoga, about
Sahaja Yogis.

564
00:55:24,385 --> 00:55:27,125
To Me they are all My liabilities. I have
to look after them,

565
00:55:27,326 --> 00:55:31,627
I have to worry about them, I have to listen
to them. I receive letters and all that.

566
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:37,824
I mean, this kind of work if somebody has
to do, nobody would accept.

567
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:47,142
In every way I have to support, because
My Spirit gets satisfied.

568
00:55:48,268 --> 00:55:50,848
It’s for the satisfaction, My own
satisfaction,

569
00:55:51,017 --> 00:55:54,829
I’m not doing for your satisfaction,
I’m doing for My own satisfaction.

570
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:57,962
Is selfishness.

571
00:55:58,986 --> 00:56:03,904
So when you reach that selfhood, you will
understand what this self needs

572
00:56:04,105 --> 00:56:08,559
and you’ll put your mind to it and you’ll
be surprised that when you start doing

573
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:18,579
something for others, for Sahaja Yoga,
it’s very much rewarding

574
00:56:18,951 --> 00:56:23,662
and very much like a prayer.

575
00:56:24,526 --> 00:56:27,791
Everything is a prayer in Sahaja Yoga.

576
00:56:27,992 --> 00:56:33,670
Whatever you do for Sahaja Yoga is
a prayer, is a rapport.

577
00:56:33,889 --> 00:56:40,720
Is the oneness with God. Is what we can
call the worship.

578
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:43,865
And once you start doing that,

579
00:56:44,066 --> 00:56:48,056
you’ll not bother as to who criticizes you,
what people say to you, nothing.

580
00:56:48,257 --> 00:56:55,141
But you’ll feel such relationship and
understanding.

581
00:56:58,117 --> 00:57:03,175
I’m sure, this Shiva Puja will definitely
establish you

582
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:07,422
at a much higher level, I’m sure.

583
00:57:07,897 --> 00:57:11,748
And you will know where you are.

584
00:57:12,716 --> 00:57:17,481
I’m very happy about it, that a Shiva Puja
was arranged here.

585
00:57:17,682 --> 00:57:26,367
Once it was arranged in Europe. It was all
full of storms and snowfall, and everything.

586
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:30,749
But so many came to Rome for the Shiva
Puja.

587
00:57:30,950 --> 00:57:35,728
They all asked Me: ‘Mother, we should have
one Shiva Puja.’ And the whole thing

588
00:57:35,929 --> 00:57:39,176
was so surprising, that people came from
Greece and everywhere,

589
00:57:39,377 --> 00:57:43,865
driving down, I don’t know. And there was
always report of snowfall is there,

590
00:57:44,042 --> 00:57:49,109
flood is there, and they were all there.

591
00:57:50,053 --> 00:57:56,520
And suddenly, I found a level had risen,

592
00:57:56,721 --> 00:58:01,451
because here we are in direct contact
with our spirit.

593
00:58:01,652 --> 00:58:04,287
Here we know about our spirit.

594
00:58:04,488 --> 00:58:10,605
We are obliged to our spirit what
it has done to us, we respect it.

595
00:58:10,806 --> 00:58:17,505
And that’s how I’ve seen the certain
change,

596
00:58:17,706 --> 00:58:22,750
and a very great height suddenly they
achieved.

597
00:58:22,951 --> 00:58:26,966
And I am sure, this will happen
to Australians.

598
00:58:27,167 --> 00:58:32,869
Now forget your small differences, fighting
for power,

599
00:58:33,070 --> 00:58:38,963
fighting for money nonsense. Try to be
all right.

600
00:58:39,164 --> 00:58:43,551
There are some people who got caught up,
because of this nonsense in Melbourne.

601
00:58:43,744 --> 00:58:49,107
They should all cleanse themselves out,
put themselves right

602
00:58:49,308 --> 00:58:53,170
and look after themselves. All My blessings
with you.

603
00:58:53,371 --> 00:58:56,010
May God bless you.

604
00:59:06,130 --> 00:59:08,889
[Hindi: If you all want to sing some songs
and then we will move.]

605
00:59:09,090 --> 00:59:15,104
So I’ll be bidding you farewell.
[Hindi: Did you bring the gifts?]

606
00:59:16,238 --> 00:59:19,759
At the parting I want to give

607
00:59:20,671 --> 00:59:27,032
something small for all the leaders, because
I want them to write the diary.

608
00:59:35,307 --> 00:59:39,162
So it is for other leaders, apart from

609
00:59:39,363 --> 00:59:46,002
our main leader, the National leader.
This is for everyone.

610
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:50,513
Yogi: John Henshaw, Melbourne.

611
01:00:11,853 --> 01:00:16,387
Are you all right, John? All right now,

612
01:00:16,588 --> 01:00:22,181
try to keep your blood pressure low
by not discussing,

613
01:00:22,382 --> 01:00:27,857
talking to all nonsense, all right?
And just put your right hand

614
01:00:28,058 --> 01:00:32,926
towards the Photograph and you know
the right hand treatment.

615
01:00:33,127 --> 01:00:35,810
So may God bless you.

616
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:45,907
Shri Mataji: Brian Bell. Yogi: Brian Bell.

617
01:01:02,246 --> 01:01:05,491
Yes. May God bless you.

618
01:01:10,495 --> 01:01:15,535
Yogi: (Inaudible name)

619
01:01:25,271 --> 01:01:28,250
May God bless you.

620
01:01:28,846 --> 01:01:31,227
Yogi: (Inaudible name)

621
01:01:41,827 --> 01:01:44,494
Yogi: John Fisher.

622
01:01:56,131 --> 01:02:02,134
Is only for the people where I visited
and also

623
01:02:04,859 --> 01:02:09,051
for the different states as you have.

624
01:02:09,479 --> 01:02:15,357
But you see, your Customs are so funny,
you’d better give them a bandhan,

625
01:02:15,558 --> 01:02:18,504
that I can’t bring any presents for all
of you.

626
01:02:18,705 --> 01:02:21,904
That’s the only thing I didn’t like about
Australia.

627
01:02:22,105 --> 01:02:27,135
Because they are very strict and really
funny people.

628
01:02:28,309 --> 01:02:34,140
In every country presents are allowed
except in yours.

629
01:02:38,178 --> 01:02:40,104
So now... [Hindi: If you want to sing
anything?].

630
01:02:40,305 --> 01:02:43,278
Then we’ll have to go. I’ll have to go
back,
