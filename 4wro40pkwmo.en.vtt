WEBVTT

00:13.306 --> 00:16.087
So today's the Christmas Eve.

01:02.840 --> 01:08.824
Should say tonight is the
Christmas eve and we are all here.

01:12.618 --> 01:18.394
We have to understand that now we have really,

01:19.431 --> 01:23.385
entered into the era of Jerusalem

01:28.947 --> 01:33.610
and where you are built in such a way,

01:35.822 --> 01:38.140
that we can understand,

01:40.181 --> 01:43.501
the great incarnation of Christ.

01:44.954 --> 01:49.715
So far, He was never understood

01:51.595 --> 01:55.907
because it was a very subtle incarnation

01:57.525 --> 01:59.245
and that,

02:01.382 --> 02:05.132
has made people go much away from him.

02:06.726 --> 02:12.320
From the principle of which he was made the innocence.

02:20.422 --> 02:26.445
So today we have to remember how incarnated on this earth.

02:29.520 --> 02:32.900
The innocence, the auspiciousness

02:33.724 --> 02:39.030
which was filled by Adi Shakti to begin with

02:39.395 --> 02:43.398
when She started to create this universe,

02:45.113 --> 02:47.660
that He was the embodiment,

02:50.730 --> 02:55.861
of all that which was so necessary

02:56.553 --> 02:59.435
before the creation started.

03:06.631 --> 03:13.506
It’s hard to understand how people could not feel it.

03:18.744 --> 03:21.236
They all have suffered so much.

03:28.055 --> 03:32.235
Whatever it is, for the Divine they do not suffer

03:35.513 --> 03:39.286
and they come on this earth to show how stupid we are,

03:41.615 --> 03:45.078
how we have not been able,

03:45.279 --> 03:49.631
to see the Truth, to see the reality.

03:51.464 --> 03:56.010
But we repeat the mistakes again and again,

03:59.353 --> 04:03.251
because we do not know ourselves,

04:04.160 --> 04:09.277
which is the only instrument by which you can know the Divine.

04:10.416 --> 04:16.118
And when we do not know
ourselves we cannot understand the Divine.

04:21.000 --> 04:26.718
Still, it’s such a great thing to see so many of you are

04:27.386 --> 04:34.598
there in that subtle area of the Spirit.

04:36.402 --> 04:41.003
That you have the sensitivity, that you can feel,

04:41.620 --> 04:47.540
the beauty of their lives, the greatness, the purity,

04:47.740 --> 04:53.829
the innocence of these great incarnations who came on this earth.

05:01.209 --> 05:06.669
But with all that, we have a very great responsibility also.

05:07.056 --> 05:13.509
Christ had only 12 disciples who didn’t even get their Realization till Christ lived.

05:13.730 --> 05:18.279
Afterwards they got Realization – 12 of them.

05:18.480 --> 05:22.722
And imagine, somebody like Thomas came to India.

05:23.474 --> 05:29.006
So, how they took so much
responsibility. They were just ordinary fishermen.

05:30.511 --> 05:33.864
They didn’t care for anything else,
but they thought, “This is the Truth

05:34.064 --> 05:39.542
and that we have to spread
this, this is our responsibility.”

05:43.014 --> 05:45.014
We are so many.

05:45.973 --> 05:51.335
That is our responsibility. Is not only to enjoy yourself,

05:52.109 --> 05:54.660
but to spread Sahaja Yoga

05:55.070 --> 05:57.740
and to practice it.

05:59.492 --> 06:06.468
Moreover, to have an ideal life,

06:06.953 --> 06:13.265
that people could see us: how we behave, how we talk,

06:14.785 --> 06:19.441
how we treat each other, how we love each other,

06:20.125 --> 06:25.937
how we understand each other, how we run to help each other –

06:26.656 --> 06:28.656
like one body.

06:32.726 --> 06:38.617
The message of Christ’s life is love.

06:40.129 --> 06:42.552
He openly talked about it.

06:44.560 --> 06:50.888
Before that, I don’t think any
incarnation talked like that, in that manner,

06:51.747 --> 06:53.839
so openly.

06:54.040 --> 07:00.576
He told His disciples that, “The greatest
joy for Me is to see that you love each other.”

07:02.754 --> 07:09.209
All those things that have really made our society,

07:09.410 --> 07:15.479
made our lives miserable of jealousies and pettiness,

07:15.680 --> 07:20.953
small-mindedness has to go.
Otherwise you are not Sahaja Yogis.

07:22.289 --> 07:25.226
Where is the time for jealousy?

07:25.831 --> 07:28.679
There is no mind, this…

07:30.410 --> 07:35.308
that can see those things, anymore.

07:36.103 --> 07:38.356
So, all of us have to evolve,

07:38.556 --> 07:44.017
and the sign of evolution is not how
much we can talk about Sahaja Yoga,

07:44.344 --> 07:49.300
how much we can practice Sahaja Yoga,

07:49.570 --> 07:52.298
how much we spread Sahaja Yoga.

07:52.594 --> 07:55.537
That’s not the sign, don’t be convinced by that.

07:56.318 --> 07:59.702
But the sign of Sahaja Yoga is that

07:59.903 --> 08:04.411
how much we can love each other,

08:07.325 --> 08:10.450
how much we understand each other,

08:12.950 --> 08:19.540
how much we can endure for others with great joy

08:20.528 --> 08:24.940
and how much we do not bother about ourselves,

08:25.809 --> 08:28.699
our families, our children.

08:30.239 --> 08:35.965
This ‘mine, my, me’ has too.

08:38.625 --> 08:42.740
It doesn’t go by saying “go”. It’s a state, again.

08:42.940 --> 08:45.145
But then only you should be convinced,

08:45.345 --> 08:49.033
“Now I am a Sahaja Yogi!”

08:55.626 --> 08:59.712
Christ has said, “Love thy neighbor as thyself!”

08:59.913 --> 09:03.172
I would say that

09:03.483 --> 09:07.977
you have to love every Sahaja Yogi as yourself,

09:08.178 --> 09:11.836
because they are part and parcel of this body.

09:12.037 --> 09:15.802
You cannot afford to hate someone.

09:16.044 --> 09:22.098
Of course, those who are useless are thrown out of the body.

09:22.575 --> 09:27.512
But those who are there living, you must love them.

09:27.874 --> 09:30.645
I think this is the message of Christ

09:31.805 --> 09:36.900
and other message is absolute morality,

09:37.279 --> 09:39.359
absolute morality.

09:43.441 --> 09:48.490
As He has said that, “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes”

09:48.690 --> 09:51.650
is such a subtle thing to say,

09:52.407 --> 09:56.799
that you should not have eyes which have adultery in them.

09:57.825 --> 10:02.575
It doesn’t mean only for women but it also mean for saints.

10:04.451 --> 10:11.068
It also means for properties,
it also means for the success of others.

10:11.471 --> 10:15.980
Adultery means the one where you try to aggress

10:16.181 --> 10:19.508
and to be greedy about it.

10:23.943 --> 10:29.473
If there is greed or if there is lust in your eyes,

10:29.674 --> 10:32.830
then it’s an adulterous eyes.

10:35.618 --> 10:38.740
It is very subtle, I know.

10:39.213 --> 10:41.540
It is very subtle

10:41.740 --> 10:46.715
and the attention is the best way

10:47.017 --> 10:50.180
which communicates to you

10:50.450 --> 10:56.801
whether you are above lust and greed or not.

10:58.437 --> 11:02.780
But the more you try to rise above these things,

11:03.350 --> 11:05.756
your heart opens

11:06.256 --> 11:09.804
and you start enjoying your virtues, your morality.

11:10.004 --> 11:14.570
You enjoy, you don’t think you are moral, you don’t think that way,

11:14.771 --> 11:20.294
but you enjoy that state where you
are really moral because you are moral.

11:22.532 --> 11:24.603
You just enjoy yourself.

11:25.745 --> 11:31.700
It’s a headache to be interested in some
woman, interested in some man. It’s a headache.

11:32.064 --> 11:34.480
It’s a joyless pursuit.

11:35.703 --> 11:39.789
And once you are detached,

11:40.208 --> 11:43.247
the joy is complete…

11:48.640 --> 11:53.772
…because you are one with reality, pure reality.

11:54.688 --> 11:56.688
There is no …

12:00.235 --> 12:06.620
inhibitions, no restrictions, no taboos, – nothing,

12:06.821 --> 12:09.353
but just you are that!

12:09.696 --> 12:12.196
Nobody has to tell you.

12:13.316 --> 12:15.826
If you are gold, you are gold.

12:16.027 --> 12:20.820
Nobody has to tell you, “Now,
you don’t behave like non-gold”,

12:21.020 --> 12:23.495
you are gold, so you are gold.

12:24.712 --> 12:26.720
That’s the power!

12:27.946 --> 12:34.391
And the power of a Sahaja Yogi is
that he is the purest form of human being.

12:35.310 --> 12:38.670
Without the power what are we? Nothing.

12:40.927 --> 12:43.300
The purest form

12:44.078 --> 12:49.780
and in the purest form of love

12:50.745 --> 12:56.380
you get the purest form of knowledge.

12:57.001 --> 12:59.660
This is [kaivaldya?] is the,

13:00.634 --> 13:05.020
absolute knowledge

13:05.321 --> 13:09.673
and absolute love,

13:12.639 --> 13:15.803
detached, pure.

13:22.149 --> 13:29.149
That time when you are in that state,

13:32.873 --> 13:37.319
you just watch anything, see anything,

13:40.594 --> 13:46.328
all the power of giving joy from everything

13:46.618 --> 13:53.079
just starts bubbling into you and you don’t see
the bad things at all, you never see the bad things.

13:58.750 --> 14:02.900
The power of enjoying everything

14:03.100 --> 14:06.898
is the power of Sahaja Yogis, to enjoy everything.

14:11.320 --> 14:13.320
Anything can be enjoyed,

14:14.506 --> 14:17.154
any small thing can be enjoyed,

14:17.956 --> 14:20.420
any big thing can be enjoyed.

14:20.760 --> 14:23.964
But impurities one cannot enjoy,

14:24.503 --> 14:27.089
immorality you cannot enjoy.

14:27.290 --> 14:32.302
It’s not enjoyment, it’s just a fascination
maybe, I don’t know what it is called as,

14:32.503 --> 14:35.700
as I cannot enjoy then I don’t know what it
is.

14:35.948 --> 14:41.887
But what you enjoy really is the purity of another personality,

14:42.088 --> 14:44.891
the purity of this,

14:45.091 --> 14:50.373
all that is done by someone with such pure heart.

14:52.028 --> 14:55.091
And the deeper you seek,

14:57.401 --> 14:59.722
it becomes simpler and simpler.

14:59.922 --> 15:02.901
Then you don’t say smart things, no, you don’t,

15:03.141 --> 15:07.243
don’t have to show off, nothing.

15:07.641 --> 15:12.060
You just say simple, sweet nice things.

15:12.484 --> 15:16.500
It’s so touching, so beautiful,

15:19.710 --> 15:25.700
but must allow the deeper love within us to come out.

15:26.267 --> 15:31.993
Many people love also but they don’t know how to express it.

15:32.210 --> 15:37.967
There are many people who are misunderstood,
because they don’t know how to express their love.

15:38.280 --> 15:43.060
In Sahaja Yoga you have to learn the yukti,

15:44.350 --> 15:45.950
the technique.

15:46.233 --> 15:50.326
“Yukti” is a very sweet word, not technique is not,

15:50.527 --> 15:54.233
technique deals with something very materialistic.

15:54.584 --> 15:58.599
But yukti means the trick, trick of the trade,

15:58.927 --> 16:05.500
what to say when that would really just pierce,

16:07.676 --> 16:13.614
like a dart in the heart of someone, the beautiful feeling.

16:17.529 --> 16:21.498
That one has to understand and practice.

16:22.701 --> 16:25.451
All little-little things here and there,

16:27.291 --> 16:34.142
little turning here and there is
an art of living a Sahaja Yoga life.

16:36.146 --> 16:39.708
And I’ve seen children say such sweet-sweet things.

16:40.502 --> 16:44.309
That’s why Christ has said that, “You have to be like children

16:44.669 --> 16:50.069
to enter into the Kingdom of God”, but I
would say, “to stay in the Kingdom of God.”

16:50.418 --> 16:55.808
You have to be simple like children, deep and simple.

17:01.969 --> 17:07.623
This seminar, or whatever you may call
it, Ganapatipule, I don’t know what you call,

17:07.823 --> 17:13.832
is a Divine congregation of all the Gods and Goddesses,

17:16.290 --> 17:19.953
is very symbolic to Me,

17:21.290 --> 17:25.792
because this represents the whole world,

17:26.241 --> 17:29.415
it represents the problems of the whole world

17:29.616 --> 17:32.420
and also the solutions.

17:33.178 --> 17:37.037
It’s such a beautiful idea.

17:37.248 --> 17:41.757
I don’t know how it worked into
My head that I started this kind of a,

17:41.958 --> 17:48.179
beautiful congregation to meet you all.

17:49.952 --> 17:55.340
It was very nice yesterday, you kept
awake all the while and came to see Me.

17:55.540 --> 18:00.276
I could meet all of you and I could have some rapport.

18:00.476 --> 18:03.179
I couldn’t say much, I was just smiling at you,

18:03.380 --> 18:07.192
but just I could express My
love and you gave Me that chance.

18:07.393 --> 18:09.903
I must thank you very much for that.
