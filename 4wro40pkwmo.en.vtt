00:00:13.306 --> 00:00:16.087
So today's the Christmas Eve.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.824
Should say tonight is the
Christmas eve and we are all here.

00:01:12.618 --> 00:01:18.394
We have to understand that now we have really,

00:01:19.431 --> 00:01:23.385
entered into the era of Jerusalem

00:01:28.947 --> 00:01:33.610
and where you are built in such a way,

00:01:35.822 --> 00:01:38.140
that we can understand,

00:01:40.181 --> 00:01:43.501
the great incarnation of Christ.

00:01:44.954 --> 00:01:49.715
So far, He was never understood

00:01:51.595 --> 00:01:55.907
because it was a very subtle incarnation

00:01:57.525 --> 00:01:59.245
and that,

00:02:01.382 --> 00:02:05.132
has made people go much away from him.

00:02:06.726 --> 00:02:12.320
From the principle of which he was made the innocence.

00:02:20.422 --> 00:02:26.445
So today we have to remember how incarnated on this earth.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.900
The innocence, the auspiciousness

00:02:33.724 --> 00:02:39.030
which was filled by Adi Shakti to begin with

00:02:39.395 --> 00:02:43.398
when She started to create this universe,

00:02:45.113 --> 00:02:47.660
that He was the embodiment,

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.861
of all that which was so necessary

00:02:56.553 --> 00:02:59.435
before the creation started.

00:03:06.631 --> 00:03:13.506
It’s hard to understand how people could not feel it.

00:03:18.744 --> 00:03:21.236
They all have suffered so much.

00:03:28.055 --> 00:03:32.235
Whatever it is, for the Divine they do not suffer

00:03:35.513 --> 00:03:39.286
and they come on this earth to show how stupid we are,

00:03:41.615 --> 00:03:45.078
how we have not been able,

00:03:45.279 --> 00:03:49.631
to see the Truth, to see the reality.

00:03:51.464 --> 00:03:56.010
But we repeat the mistakes again and again,

00:03:59.353 --> 00:04:03.251
because we do not know ourselves,

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.277
which is the only instrument by which you can know the Divine.

00:04:10.416 --> 00:04:16.118
And when we do not know
ourselves we cannot understand the Divine.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.718
Still, it’s such a great thing to see so many of you are

00:04:27.386 --> 00:04:34.598
there in that subtle area of the Spirit.

00:04:36.402 --> 00:04:41.003
That you have the sensitivity, that you can feel,

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:47.540
the beauty of their lives, the greatness, the purity,

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:53.829
the innocence of these great incarnations who came on this earth.

00:05:01.209 --> 00:05:06.669
But with all that, we have a very great responsibility also.

00:05:07.056 --> 00:05:13.509
Christ had only 12 disciples who didn’t even get their Realization till Christ lived.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:18.279
Afterwards they got Realization – 12 of them.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.722
And imagine, somebody like Thomas came to India.

00:05:23.474 --> 00:05:29.006
So, how they took so much
responsibility. They were just ordinary fishermen.

00:05:30.511 --> 00:05:33.864
They didn’t care for anything else,
but they thought, “This is the Truth

00:05:34.064 --> 00:05:39.542
and that we have to spread
this, this is our responsibility.”

00:05:43.014 --> 00:05:45.014
We are so many.

00:05:45.973 --> 00:05:51.335
That is our responsibility. Is not only to enjoy yourself,

00:05:52.109 --> 00:05:54.660
but to spread Sahaja Yoga

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.740
and to practice it.

00:05:59.492 --> 00:06:06.468
Moreover, to have an ideal life,

00:06:06.953 --> 00:06:13.265
that people could see us: how we behave, how we talk,

00:06:14.785 --> 00:06:19.441
how we treat each other, how we love each other,

00:06:20.125 --> 00:06:25.937
how we understand each other, how we run to help each other –

00:06:26.656 --> 00:06:28.656
like one body.

00:06:32.726 --> 00:06:38.617
The message of Christ’s life is love.

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:42.552
He openly talked about it.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:50.888
Before that, I don’t think any
incarnation talked like that, in that manner,

00:06:51.747 --> 00:06:53.839
so openly.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:07:00.576
He told His disciples that, “The greatest
joy for Me is to see that you love each other.”

00:07:02.754 --> 00:07:09.209
All those things that have really made our society,

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:15.479
made our lives miserable of jealousies and pettiness,

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:20.953
small-mindedness has to go.
Otherwise you are not Sahaja Yogis.

00:07:22.289 --> 00:07:25.226
Where is the time for jealousy?

00:07:25.831 --> 00:07:28.679
There is no mind, this…

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:35.308
that can see those things, anymore.

00:07:36.103 --> 00:07:38.356
So, all of us have to evolve,

00:07:38.556 --> 00:07:44.017
and the sign of evolution is not how
much we can talk about Sahaja Yoga,

00:07:44.344 --> 00:07:49.300
how much we can practice Sahaja Yoga,

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:52.298
how much we spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:52.594 --> 00:07:55.537
That’s not the sign, don’t be convinced by that.

00:07:56.318 --> 00:07:59.702
But the sign of Sahaja Yoga is that

00:07:59.903 --> 00:08:04.411
how much we can love each other,

00:08:07.325 --> 00:08:10.450
how much we understand each other,

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:19.540
how much we can endure for others with great joy

00:08:20.528 --> 00:08:24.940
and how much we do not bother about ourselves,

00:08:25.809 --> 00:08:28.699
our families, our children.

00:08:30.239 --> 00:08:35.965
This ‘mine, my, me’ has too.

00:08:38.625 --> 00:08:42.740
It doesn’t go by saying “go”. It’s a state, again.

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:45.145
But then only you should be convinced,

00:08:45.345 --> 00:08:49.033
“Now I am a Sahaja Yogi!”

00:08:55.626 --> 00:08:59.712
Christ has said, “Love thy neighbor as thyself!”

00:08:59.913 --> 00:09:03.172
I would say that

00:09:03.483 --> 00:09:07.977
you have to love every Sahaja Yogi as yourself,

00:09:08.178 --> 00:09:11.836
because they are part and parcel of this body.

00:09:12.037 --> 00:09:15.802
You cannot afford to hate someone.

00:09:16.044 --> 00:09:22.098
Of course, those who are useless are thrown out of the body.

00:09:22.575 --> 00:09:27.512
But those who are there living, you must love them.

00:09:27.874 --> 00:09:30.645
I think this is the message of Christ

00:09:31.805 --> 00:09:36.900
and other message is absolute morality,

00:09:37.279 --> 00:09:39.359
absolute morality.

00:09:43.441 --> 00:09:48.490
As He has said that, “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes”

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:51.650
is such a subtle thing to say,

00:09:52.407 --> 00:09:56.799
that you should not have eyes which have adultery in them.

00:09:57.825 --> 00:10:02.575
It doesn’t mean only for women but it also mean for saints.

00:10:04.451 --> 00:10:11.068
It also means for properties,
it also means for the success of others.

00:10:11.471 --> 00:10:15.980
Adultery means the one where you try to aggress

00:10:16.181 --> 00:10:19.508
and to be greedy about it.

00:10:23.943 --> 00:10:29.473
If there is greed or if there is lust in your eyes,

00:10:29.674 --> 00:10:32.830
then it’s an adulterous eyes.

00:10:35.618 --> 00:10:38.740
It is very subtle, I know.

00:10:39.213 --> 00:10:41.540
It is very subtle

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:46.715
and the attention is the best way

00:10:47.017 --> 00:10:50.180
which communicates to you

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:56.801
whether you are above lust and greed or not.

00:10:58.437 --> 00:11:02.780
But the more you try to rise above these things,

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:05.756
your heart opens

00:11:06.256 --> 00:11:09.804
and you start enjoying your virtues, your morality.

00:11:10.004 --> 00:11:14.570
You enjoy, you don’t think you are moral, you don’t think that way,

00:11:14.771 --> 00:11:20.294
but you enjoy that state where you
are really moral because you are moral.

00:11:22.532 --> 00:11:24.603
You just enjoy yourself.

00:11:25.745 --> 00:11:31.700
It’s a headache to be interested in some
woman, interested in some man. It’s a headache.

00:11:32.064 --> 00:11:34.480
It’s a joyless pursuit.

00:11:35.703 --> 00:11:39.789
And once you are detached,

00:11:40.208 --> 00:11:43.247
the joy is complete…

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:53.772
…because you are one with reality, pure reality.

00:11:54.688 --> 00:11:56.688
There is no …

00:12:00.235 --> 00:12:06.620
inhibitions, no restrictions, no taboos, – nothing,

00:12:06.821 --> 00:12:09.353
but just you are that!

00:12:09.696 --> 00:12:12.196
Nobody has to tell you.

00:12:13.316 --> 00:12:15.826
If you are gold, you are gold.

00:12:16.027 --> 00:12:20.820
Nobody has to tell you, “Now,
you don’t behave like non-gold”,

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:23.495
you are gold, so you are gold.

00:12:24.712 --> 00:12:26.720
That’s the power!

00:12:27.946 --> 00:12:34.391
And the power of a Sahaja Yogi is
that he is the purest form of human being.

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:38.670
Without the power what are we? Nothing.

00:12:40.927 --> 00:12:43.300
The purest form

00:12:44.078 --> 00:12:49.780
and in the purest form of love

00:12:50.745 --> 00:12:56.380
you get the purest form of knowledge.

00:12:57.001 --> 00:12:59.660
This is [kaivaldya?] is the,

00:13:00.634 --> 00:13:05.020
absolute knowledge

00:13:05.321 --> 00:13:09.673
and absolute love,

00:13:12.639 --> 00:13:15.803
detached, pure.

00:13:22.149 --> 00:13:29.149
That time when you are in that state,

00:13:32.873 --> 00:13:37.319
you just watch anything, see anything,

00:13:40.594 --> 00:13:46.328
all the power of giving joy from everything

00:13:46.618 --> 00:13:53.079
just starts bubbling into you and you don’t see
the bad things at all, you never see the bad things.

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:02.900
The power of enjoying everything

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:06.898
is the power of Sahaja Yogis, to enjoy everything.

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:13.320
Anything can be enjoyed,

00:14:14.506 --> 00:14:17.154
any small thing can be enjoyed,

00:14:17.956 --> 00:14:20.420
any big thing can be enjoyed.

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.964
But impurities one cannot enjoy,

00:14:24.503 --> 00:14:27.089
immorality you cannot enjoy.

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:32.302
It’s not enjoyment, it’s just a fascination
maybe, I don’t know what it is called as,

00:14:32.503 --> 00:14:35.700
as I cannot enjoy then I don’t know what it
is.

00:14:35.948 --> 00:14:41.887
But what you enjoy really is the purity of another personality,

00:14:42.088 --> 00:14:44.891
the purity of this,

00:14:45.091 --> 00:14:50.373
all that is done by someone with such pure heart.

00:14:52.028 --> 00:14:55.091
And the deeper you seek,

00:14:57.401 --> 00:14:59.722
it becomes simpler and simpler.

00:14:59.922 --> 00:15:02.901
Then you don’t say smart things, no, you don’t,

00:15:03.141 --> 00:15:07.243
don’t have to show off, nothing.

00:15:07.641 --> 00:15:12.060
You just say simple, sweet nice things.

00:15:12.484 --> 00:15:16.500
It’s so touching, so beautiful,

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:25.700
but must allow the deeper love within us to come out.

00:15:26.267 --> 00:15:31.993
Many people love also but they don’t know how to express it.

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:37.967
There are many people who are misunderstood,
because they don’t know how to express their love.

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:43.060
In Sahaja Yoga you have to learn the yukti,

00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:45.950
the technique.

00:15:46.233 --> 00:15:50.326
“Yukti” is a very sweet word, not technique is not,

00:15:50.527 --> 00:15:54.233
technique deals with something very materialistic.

00:15:54.584 --> 00:15:58.599
But yukti means the trick, trick of the trade,

00:15:58.927 --> 00:16:05.500
what to say when that would really just pierce,

00:16:07.676 --> 00:16:13.614
like a dart in the heart of someone, the beautiful feeling.

00:16:17.529 --> 00:16:21.498
That one has to understand and practice.

00:16:22.701 --> 00:16:25.451
All little-little things here and there,

00:16:27.291 --> 00:16:34.142
little turning here and there is
an art of living a Sahaja Yoga life.

00:16:36.146 --> 00:16:39.708
And I’ve seen children say such sweet-sweet things.

00:16:40.502 --> 00:16:44.309
That’s why Christ has said that, “You have to be like children

00:16:44.669 --> 00:16:50.069
to enter into the Kingdom of God”, but I
would say, “to stay in the Kingdom of God.”

00:16:50.418 --> 00:16:55.808
You have to be simple like children, deep and simple.

00:17:01.969 --> 00:17:07.623
This seminar, or whatever you may call
it, Ganapatipule, I don’t know what you call,

00:17:07.823 --> 00:17:13.832
is a Divine congregation of all the Gods and Goddesses,

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:19.953
is very symbolic to Me,

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:25.792
because this represents the whole world,

00:17:26.241 --> 00:17:29.415
it represents the problems of the whole world

00:17:29.616 --> 00:17:32.420
and also the solutions.

00:17:33.178 --> 00:17:37.037
It’s such a beautiful idea.

00:17:37.248 --> 00:17:41.757
I don’t know how it worked into
My head that I started this kind of a,

00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:48.179
beautiful congregation to meet you all.

00:17:49.952 --> 00:17:55.340
It was very nice yesterday, you kept
awake all the while and came to see Me.

00:17:55.540 --> 00:18:00.276
I could meet all of you and I could have some rapport.

00:18:00.476 --> 00:18:03.179
I couldn’t say much, I was just smiling at you,

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:07.192
but just I could express My
love and you gave Me that chance.

00:18:07.393 --> 00:18:09.903
I must thank you very much for that.
