1
00:00:05,859 --> 00:00:15,169
'Saha' means with, 'ja' means born, so
it is born with you, the right, to become

2
00:00:15,169 --> 00:00:21,580
united, which is the yoga with the Divine.
We have two sides in our system of,

3
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:26,479
Autonomous Nervous System - left and right
- which we call as Left and Right Sympathetic

4
00:00:26,479 --> 00:00:36,955
Nervous System. The left side caters for
our emotions, for our past, our desires.

5
00:00:36,955 --> 00:00:44,982
The right side caters for our action, 
physical and mental. If you indulge into one

6
00:00:44,982 --> 00:00:50,224
too much and go too far with it, you
develop an imbalance within yourself.

7
00:00:51,398 --> 00:00:56,118
In the center lies the third power, which
we call as Para Sympathetic Nervous System

8
00:00:56,636 --> 00:01:01,796
This is the channel, which is the central
path of ascent. When the Kundalini rises

9
00:01:01,796 --> 00:01:08,798
through it, it brings you in the balance
because it rises in the center of the system.

10
00:01:10,128 --> 00:01:14,128
So, this is the minimum that happens that
you develop to your balance. This is the

11
00:01:14,128 --> 00:01:19,469
last breakthrough of or evolution, where
you have to get connected with the Divine,

12
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:25,580
you have to feel it on your Central Nervous
System and that's how you get your
Self-realization.
