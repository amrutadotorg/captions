00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:40.270
Today we have gathered here to do Shri Ganesha
puja.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:58.170
The first Deity that was created by the Adi
Shakti was Shri Ganesh because it was necessary

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:12.300
first to create the Deity of principles.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:31.910
The deity of principle in the sense that whatever
is created, whatever is there as called ‘bhava’

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:38.760
– whatever has been so far created – up
to human level.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:58.530
Everything had to be through the implanted
mechanism of energy otherwise nothing could

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:05.190
have been created.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:15.640
If you go into the matter, say sulphur dioxide,
then sulphur and oxide — go on deep into

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:25.579
it till you reach the state when it is a molecule
— then you see these atoms of sulphur and

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:30.280
oxygen, they oscillate.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.750
They oscillate with a frequency.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:41.040
There are three types of frequencies they
use.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:52.420
Now imagine in the molecule – think of it
– in the molecule of a substance there is

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.510
an energy which is acting.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:03.810
Now one may say that, “Why should be in
matter there is energy?”

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:16.630
One can ask a question, why there should be
energy in matter.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:27.669
If there was no energy in the matter, how
can you have all chemical compounds?

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:29.760
Who pushes them?

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:37.840
Say you have sodium chloride – sodium and
chloride are attached to each other.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:46.180
But if the chloride has to go to some other
atom then who does that?

00:04:46.180 --> 00:05:03.180
There has to be some energy which is absolutely
inbuilt into matter.

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:17.740
Now, we may say that, “What about water?”

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:24.750
You know water has energy, that’s how we
have hydrostatics.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:36.389
Even coal, even stones, all of them have got
energy within themselves.

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:43.660
And it is all controlled by the principle
of Shri Ganesh.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:53.710
So, though He’s such a small, little, tiny,
little child, how great is His work and how

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.389
much He has to work out.

00:05:55.389 --> 00:06:04.590
Now from matter, you move, say, to living
plants, then to animals, then to human beings

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.910
and everywhere His energy works.

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:16.669
At the level of matter, they might call it
‘electromagnetic’ but potentially it is

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:22.680
the energy of Shri Ganesh, which is electromagnetic
at that point.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.270
Then it starts evolving, growing.

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:40.080
That’s how we have different stratas of
energies that we see in different growth of

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:46.220
the evolution.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:07:05.740
In the human being it exists, as you know,
as auspiciousness, as purity, mainly the innocence.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:13.639
So the power of innocence is such a guiding
factor.

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:21.770
There’s a difference between ignorance and
innocence.

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:37.819
If you are innocent then, to you, nothing
is important except for love.

00:07:37.819 --> 00:07:48.240
For an innocent person – who is not conditioned,
who is not egoistical, who is not so-called

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:56.960
matured – it is the love that it understands.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:14.870
It doesn’t care for any wealth, any power,
anything but the love that it can feel, the

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:20.389
pure love of a person.

00:08:20.389 --> 00:08:33.409
Innocent person has no understanding of gaining
anything out of the love he receives or he

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:38.210
gives; no sense at all.

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:44.540
Innocence is the basis of all the dharmas.

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:58.230
If you have no innocence you cannot follow
dharma because if you are dharmic it is maybe

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:07.010
your mental attitude, maybe egoistical, maybe
because you are born in a religion or because

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:09.470
somebody has told you about it.

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:14.810
It’s going to be very superficial.

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:24.680
Unless and until it is embedded in the quality
of innocence dharma has no meaning.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.790
In that state you are dharmic.

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:37.280
You are beyond any thinking about it, of any
deductions about it.

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:38.280
But you are dharmic.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.680
You cannot be adharmic.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:44.530
You cannot be.

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:52.069
As if the manifestation of innocence is morality.

00:09:52.069 --> 00:10:01.730
Once Shri Ganesha is awakened — I hope He
has been awakened in all of you — and if

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:11.870
you respect Him, just respect Him, then automatically
you develop a sense of morality.

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:15.510
I don’t have to tell you.

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:18.580
I don’t have to explain to you.

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:24.040
You just become moral.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:31.030
People who have seen you are quite amazed
and said that, “How is it that their eyes

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:37.300
are fixed, so innocent, without any lust and
greed?”

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:49.400
It’s the light of Shri Ganesha from the
Back Agnya, Front Agnya; the Jesus Christ,

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:58.030
who is the manifestation of Shri Ganesha.

00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:03.640
It is impossible for [the] Western mind to
understand that Jesus Christ was purity.

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.690
They can’t understand.

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:10.740
And they have criticised Him and said horrible
things against Him.

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:15.069
But somehow He’s forgiving them.

00:11:15.069 --> 00:11:27.820
But one thing about Shri Ganesh is that He
worships His Mother.

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:44.320
Motherhood is very important: motherhood in
the women, motherhood in the father and also

00:11:44.320 --> 00:12:01.030
in the children has to be accepted as the
mainstay of family life and society.

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:16.700
The ordinary life of a human being, [of] very
simple, innocent, simple people, revolves

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:20.590
around the mother.

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:23.189
It revolves.

00:12:23.189 --> 00:12:26.190
But the mothers have to be mothers.

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:42.390
As Shri Ganesha is so much surrendered to
His Mother and who is His Mother?

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:44.179
Is Adi Shakti.

00:12:44.179 --> 00:12:46.809
He does not know anybody else.

00:12:46.809 --> 00:12:52.459
He just knows His Mother.

00:12:52.459 --> 00:13:03.910
This is extremely important in Sahaj Yog.

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:20.770
As we say, there are immoral human beings
and they are doing immoral things because

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:31.560
they are committing sin against the Adi Shakti.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:44.270
Committing sin against Ganesha they may be
forgiven but committing sin against the Adi

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:59.190
Shakti…It encompasses a very big area where
we start seeing how we are committing the

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:09.280
sin against the Adi Shakti which, ultimately,
Shri Ganesha punishes, ultimately.

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:23.250
Actually, the Adi Shakti doesn’t punish
anyone, the Deities only punish them.

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:38.670
First and foremost thing that is to be understood
[is] that innocence should be respected, looked

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:44.130
after, nourished and protected.

00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:50.980
That’s why I am very particular about the
children.

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:57.290
Children should not be exposed to the public.

00:14:57.290 --> 00:15:04.610
We should not try to make photographs out
of our children and expose them in the newspaper

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:08.760
or give them for advertisement or anything
there.

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:25.910
It’s a very wrong idea to expose your children
to gain some money out of them: in any way,

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:28.690
in the smallest way also.

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:34.959
Because we are selling the innocence, the
innocence which is invaluable, writ large

00:15:34.959 --> 00:15:40.220
on the children.

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:49.680
Many children I know, who have been advertised
and all that, specially in India have died.

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:57.440
Also we have to look after our children with
great care.

00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:02.160
But we go to two extremes, I have seen.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:05.689
Some people are only worried about their own
children – if anything happens to them [they]

00:16:05.689 --> 00:16:10.890
just get upset.

00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:15.289
That means you are respecting your child because
he’s your child.

00:16:15.289 --> 00:16:22.299
But if you are respecting him because he carries
innocence with him, then you have to respect

00:16:22.299 --> 00:16:31.200
every child and understand every child: what
they talk, what they say, how they behave.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:34.689
Luckily, you all have got children now who
are born-realised.

00:16:34.689 --> 00:16:37.339
It’s such a great thing!

00:16:37.339 --> 00:16:39.980
It’s such a blessing!

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:45.069
So on one side, we have to see how innocent
they are and how they talk.

00:16:45.069 --> 00:16:48.290
I’ll give you an example.

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:57.630
Wolfgang was very serious and his wife told
me that we were taking him to the hospital,

00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:01.730
so his daughter says, “Why are you taking
him to the hospital?

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:04.089
There are no Sahaja Yogis there!

00:17:04.089 --> 00:17:08.249
How will they correct his chakras?”

00:17:08.249 --> 00:17:09.919
Innocently said the correct thing.

00:17:09.919 --> 00:17:10.919
And they couldn’t do.

00:17:10.919 --> 00:17:12.530
Doctors didn’t do anything.

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:14.870
I had to cure him!

00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:16.699
“Take him to Mother!

00:17:16.699 --> 00:17:19.420
Why are you taking him to the hospital?”

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:27.329
They see the right point and say the right
thing because they are innocent and innocence

00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:30.850
means they have pure attention.

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:39.200
Pure attention, for anything, you need: say
[for] music, for art.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:47.330
For anything you have to have pure attention
and that comes through your innocence.

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:54.380
Say a person who is an artist and who is very
money-oriented, for example, a person who

00:17:54.380 --> 00:18:00.620
is doing some paintings and all that: his
art cannot become eternal art.

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:01.620
Cannot.

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:06.390
That’s why we see in modern times [that],
whatever art is created, it just comes and

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:07.390
goes.

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:11.030
It has no eternal value.

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:13.630
Same with the modern music that they are having.

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:15.180
The same thing is happening.

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:24.059
It comes and goes and no one knows where it
has disappeared.

00:18:24.059 --> 00:18:37.519
Behind it is money orientation and that money
orientation results into a kind of a creation

00:18:37.519 --> 00:18:42.830
which is not perfect.

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:51.799
All creations which were dedicated to God
in the olden times are being today very much

00:18:51.799 --> 00:18:54.580
respected and people pay a lot of money for
that.

00:18:54.580 --> 00:19:00.860
Maybe, at that time, the artist must have
suffered, but they understood, innocent artists

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:12.240
understood very much, that if we have to express,
we must truthfully do it.

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:17.710
Not to please the people, not to please anyone,
but to please God.

00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:23.860
As you know that Michelangelo had a big fight
with this pope here because he couldn’t

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:27.909
tolerate nonsense that was coming from the
pope.

00:19:27.909 --> 00:19:33.130
All the artists always have been fighting
— real artists.

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:37.730
So this innocence also gives you a power of
self-understanding.

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:44.250
You know where you stand.

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:53.909
A person who is innocent knows very well that
he is standing on the pedestal of virtues.

00:19:53.909 --> 00:20:01.530
He should not give in to all kinds of nonsensical
things which are very popular, may be fashionable,

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:02.530
may be accepted.

00:20:02.530 --> 00:20:04.730
For what?

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:11.370
For what are we going to sacrifice our innocence?

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:15.980
What is our gain?

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:21.840
Maybe some people are too brilliant and they
may try to show off with their brilliance

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:28.509
for a short time but they don’t remain in
the eternal history.

00:20:28.509 --> 00:20:38.250
They go as egoistical people or as very dishonest
people.

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:39.810
Nobody respects them.

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:55.860
So there is a big attack on the innocence
of people, a big attack.

00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:57.330
First it comes on children.

00:20:57.330 --> 00:21:03.730
As you see, this nonsense that is going on
which we hear about — I mean, I can’t

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:06.450
even understand why they do it.

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:13.370
They do it on children, these funny attacks
of abuses.

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:19.640
It’s just because they want to kill the
innocence.

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:26.580
Perhaps those who do it have no innocence
in them and they don’t want the children

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:30.140
to have any innocence left in them.

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:33.809
Otherwise, in India it’s something we can’t
understand.

00:21:33.809 --> 00:21:36.110
Really, we can’t understand.

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:43.690
But it is becoming much more prevalent, much
more fashionable now because there is definitely

00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:56.230
an attack on innocence; not only on children
but even on people who are innocent.

00:21:56.230 --> 00:22:07.740
Because those who have deliberations in criminality,
in all kinds of sinful acts will never, never

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:11.049
try to protect innocence, never!

00:22:11.049 --> 00:22:15.320
Because the juxtaposition is there.

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:18.830
They are doing something which they think
is the best.

00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:21.070
I don’t know if they think that way.

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:27.919
But I don’t know what justifies their behaviour
like this – is to attack the innocence of

00:22:27.919 --> 00:22:30.960
children.

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:36.600
In so many ways, you will find [that] this
innocence is being attacked.

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:45.179
If your children are doing well, if they are
studying well, somebody might try to catch

00:22:45.179 --> 00:22:47.730
hold of them.

00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:57.610
If some person they find is an innocent person,
they will try to put him into trouble.

00:22:57.610 --> 00:23:10.149
The innocence itself is such a power that
it challenges the hatred, the abusive nature

00:23:10.149 --> 00:23:11.740
of people.

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:24.190
First of all, we should see how our conditioning
takes over our innocence.

00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:26.210
It makes you extremely ritualistic.

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:49.700
Even in Sahaja Yoga, I have seen – I have
heard also – that people are extremely ritualistic.

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:56.820
Now the ritualism is like this: that you have
to say something three times, you say it three

00:23:56.820 --> 00:24:01.919
times, seven times like tied up people.

00:24:01.919 --> 00:24:06.399
I have seen some some Sahaja Yogis like that.

00:24:06.399 --> 00:24:13.429
And some Sahaj Yogis, I think they must be
bhootish, get frightened with me.

00:24:13.429 --> 00:24:15.259
What is there to be frightened of me?

00:24:15.259 --> 00:24:21.379
Because they are bhootish, they are getting
frightened.

00:24:21.379 --> 00:24:23.389
Otherwise why should you?

00:24:23.389 --> 00:24:31.860
I love you all and you won’t find a greater
mild guru than myself.

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:36.340
I don’t think so!

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:38.009
But they are afraid.

00:24:38.009 --> 00:24:41.509
Even if you look at them they’ll not smile,
they’ll be afraid.

00:24:41.509 --> 00:24:42.690
What wrong have you done?

00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:45.400
You have become Sahaja Yogis!

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:49.529
They are so ritualistic in everything!

00:24:49.529 --> 00:24:56.340
So one should understand a difference between
a protocol and ritualism.

00:24:56.340 --> 00:25:01.179
An innocent child knows the protocol.

00:25:01.179 --> 00:25:09.740
I remember there was a child who came to see
me in Oxted and I said, “Let’s go upstairs!”

00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:13.980
So it was a small, little staircase of wood.

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:16.110
He said, “What?

00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:21.130
Is She going to go up without a red carpet?”

00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:25.580
This came into his head!

00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:33.869
So for children, innocent children, the worship,
everything is not ritualistic, it is heartfelt.

00:25:33.869 --> 00:25:46.559
You feel it from the heart: how to do the
worship, how to show your love.

00:25:46.559 --> 00:26:00.620
It’s very sweet [the] way an innocent person
does it, while a person who is very ritualistic,

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:06.460
he may even beat another person because, “Why
did you do this?

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:08.730
You should not have put camphor in it?

00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:10.019
Why did you put the camphor?

00:26:10.019 --> 00:26:12.529
So, it’s very wrong."

00:26:12.529 --> 00:26:14.409
There’s nothing wrong.

00:26:14.409 --> 00:26:24.769
If you do it with your heart, with your open
heart, innocently – anything is all right.

00:26:24.769 --> 00:26:32.759
It is the open heart which is necessary, not
the closed heart – “Why did you do it?

00:26:32.759 --> 00:26:34.519
Why didn’t you do it.

00:26:34.519 --> 00:26:36.460
Where did you sit?

00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:37.460
What happened?”

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:38.460
Nothing!

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:45.320
Now you are in the kingdom of God and here
there are no such rules and regulations that

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:47.419
you should be ritualistic.

00:26:47.419 --> 00:26:50.990
But everything has a double style.

00:26:50.990 --> 00:27:00.040
Now I say, you need not be ritualistic so:
once I went into an ashram.

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:03.330
I found everything was just like a pigsty.

00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:05.980
I said, “What’s this?

00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:09.020
Is this an ashram or what is it?”

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:17.259
So they said, “Mother, you told us that
you have to be innocent and you don’t have

00:27:17.259 --> 00:27:20.080
to be ritualistic.

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:23.549
So we thought, ‘Throw all the things wherever
you feel like.

00:27:23.549 --> 00:27:25.320
What is there to be ritualistic?’

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:28.650
” It’s a very common thing.

00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:36.320
All the ashram leaders tell me that Sahaja
Yogis have no sense at all of looking after

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:38.360
the cleanliness of the ashram.

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:40.629
They are least bothered.

00:27:40.629 --> 00:27:46.720
If it is their house, they look after, but
if it is an ashram they do not.

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:49.090
It’s very surprising!

00:27:49.090 --> 00:27:55.019
And I have seen, or I have heard, that the
ashrams all of bhootish and false gurus are

00:27:55.019 --> 00:27:56.769
absolutely spick-and-span!

00:27:56.769 --> 00:27:58.929
Really!

00:27:58.929 --> 00:28:05.429
It’s very surprising.

00:28:05.429 --> 00:28:15.610
And, even here in Cabella, people were telling
me that they are living like animals.

00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:20.590
I said, “Animals are innocent, you know!”

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:23.120
You go into a jungle, now — I don’t know,
we are going to take you this time (on India

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:31.119
Tour to Kanha National Park) into a jungle
— you will have no smell, no horrid things

00:28:31.119 --> 00:28:32.299
to see, nothing.

00:28:32.299 --> 00:28:35.120
It’s very clean, spick-and-span, all the
time.

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:42.639
But [if] you put one human being, you will
immediately know there has been a human being.

00:28:42.639 --> 00:28:46.279
They have their own systems of keeping things
clean.

00:28:46.279 --> 00:28:53.610
Even the tiger, who is an innocent thing — up
to animal stage you are innocent — he has

00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:54.870
his own styles.

00:28:54.870 --> 00:29:02.320
I don’t know if you know about a tiger or
not, but a tiger will kill an animal because

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:04.120
he has to eat, after all.

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:06.379
He supposed to only eat animals, he doesn’t
eat grass.

00:29:06.379 --> 00:29:07.379
What to do?

00:29:07.379 --> 00:29:09.799
He’s not a vegetarian!

00:29:09.799 --> 00:29:15.049
God has made him like that so he accepts.

00:29:15.049 --> 00:29:24.129
Now he goes and kills the cow or anything
then he leaves his kill there for the blood

00:29:24.129 --> 00:29:25.159
to ooze out.

00:29:25.159 --> 00:29:30.480
Nobody will touch that, nobody, because he’s
really the king.

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:34.489
Not out of fear but a protocol.

00:29:34.489 --> 00:29:39.629
Then next day he goes [back], he eats, then
his family eats and all that; then finished

00:29:39.629 --> 00:29:43.700
for the whole month; they come out.

00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:48.710
Then the lower animals start going there.

00:29:48.710 --> 00:30:03.029
Like you have

00:30:03.029 --> 00:30:07.630
leopards and all these animals come out and
they start eating.

00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:11.629
And then even lower and lower till the birds.

00:30:11.629 --> 00:30:15.570
Still the crow, they stay back.

00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:19.110
Last are crows.

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:22.659
Can you imagine?

00:30:22.659 --> 00:30:25.890
Such a system they have!

00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:36.010
They go all the way from Siberia to Australia.

00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:37.340
How do they manage?

00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:39.169
Think of it.

00:30:39.169 --> 00:30:43.039
What gives them direction is innocence.

00:30:43.039 --> 00:30:46.529
And the innocence is a magnet.

00:30:46.529 --> 00:30:48.419
It’s a magnet.

00:30:48.419 --> 00:30:50.929
Actually it’s a magnet.

00:30:50.929 --> 00:30:57.490
In a human being you do not find a magnet
because it has now evolved so much, but it

00:30:57.490 --> 00:31:00.909
starts just like a magnet.

00:31:00.909 --> 00:31:04.730
So they know which is north, which is south,
east and west.

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:09.899
Even a little bee, you find and put a mark
on it.

00:31:09.899 --> 00:31:15.919
It goes to the place from where it has come.

00:31:15.919 --> 00:31:21.100
How does it find its own way?

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:27.960
Is the innocence [which] is like a magnet,
acts like a magnet.

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:30.080
Even in the fishes.

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:32.360
Just imagine how fishes have direction!

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:36.390
We don’t have — I mean, human beings can
be lost.

00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:47.480
Many times I am lost with so many drivers
I have had! (laughter) So many times I have

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:55.549
been lost but animals never.

00:31:55.549 --> 00:32:07.429
You know, if you take a dog and you don’t
want the dog, you leave him about fifty miles

00:32:07.429 --> 00:32:10.850
away, he’ll come back.

00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:15.279
How does he find the way?

00:32:15.279 --> 00:32:25.950
So their qualities, which are built-in within
them through their innocence, are actually

00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:34.869
the qualities of the electromagnetic force
and also pranava: that is when electromagnetic

00:32:34.869 --> 00:32:39.869
force is charged with Ganesha’s Principle.

00:32:39.869 --> 00:32:50.340
That’s why they are so systematic, they
are so clean, they are so sensible.

00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:56.640
But they are not ritualistic.

00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:01.330
They are not ritualistic.

00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:04.909
Whatever God has given them, they have accepted.

00:33:04.909 --> 00:33:07.519
They are bound by that.

00:33:07.519 --> 00:33:13.470
They are bound and they live with that boundary.

00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:21.279
Even if you go up to the stage of animals
which live with human beings, they too, are

00:33:21.279 --> 00:33:22.840
very affectionate.

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:27.460
They just want love, nothing else.

00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:33.049
One day if you do not care for your dog, he
will just not eat his food, not eat his food,

00:33:33.049 --> 00:33:36.720
he wouldn’t care for the food.

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:45.150
It is so remarkable, even I have seen among
children how they just want love.

00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:48.559
They don’t accept anything else but love.

00:33:48.559 --> 00:33:56.299
But as soon as they start growing up, specially
in a materialistic world, then the whole materialism

00:33:56.299 --> 00:33:58.690
comes in.

00:33:58.690 --> 00:34:07.150
So the second way we kill our children’s
innocence is putting materialistic ideas into

00:34:07.150 --> 00:34:09.010
their heads.

00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:15.679
Of course, the media is there which is selling,
nowadays, a teddy bear which has a birthday.

00:34:15.679 --> 00:34:18.000
Teddy bear has a birthday!

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.149
Can you imagine?

00:34:20.149 --> 00:34:23.690
So everybody is buying teddy bear with a birthday.

00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:29.740
Because the parents don’t want to be in
the company of children so they get some sort

00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:35.190
of a toys — this, that, one or two is alright
— and put them with the toys, with the television

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:36.310
on.

00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:39.670
“Now, sit down!”

00:34:39.670 --> 00:34:43.669
Children start becoming naturally materialistic.

00:34:43.669 --> 00:34:59.300
They start asking for things and for demands
of such kind that sometimes one is surprised.

00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:05.570
You take a Western child to the market and
you’ve had it!

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:09.350
But you take Indian children, they’ll never
take anything.

00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:10.350
Really!

00:35:10.350 --> 00:35:11.609
It’s so difficult to make them.

00:35:11.609 --> 00:35:15.260
At least, I have seen my own grandchildren
and other.

00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:18.940
You take them: it’s a headache to buy even
another pair of shoes for them.

00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:20.290
“No, but we have one.

00:35:20.290 --> 00:35:22.460
Why do you want to buy another?”

00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:23.460
“Oh baba!

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:24.460
That will give way!”

00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:25.710
“No, we can come here."

00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:26.710
“How?”

00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:28.850
“We can come in the car or else we can walk."

00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:31.340
“But you will have no shoes [to walk]!”

00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:32.340
“Nothing!

00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:33.340
One is alright.

00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:34.340
Why to have two?”

00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:40.890
You give them money, they’ll buy one small
little thing and come home.

00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:52.330
You see, it is the whole tradition of materialism
which has brought this innocence to a stop.

00:35:52.330 --> 00:35:56.890
Then a child starts growing in the same materialistic
way.

00:35:56.890 --> 00:36:04.450
He starts judging people like, “How many
cars you have?”

00:36:04.450 --> 00:36:05.450
You see?

00:36:05.450 --> 00:36:12.200
They are so stupidly materialistic that I
went to Boston and the television people asked

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:14.310
me, “How many Rolls Royces you have?”

00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:16.320
I said, “I don’t have any."

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:17.870
They said, “We are not interested.

00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:21.650
You are not in the business!”

00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:29.520
This is what is now the mind of people in
the West who have grown up.

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:31.810
But even the children!

00:36:31.810 --> 00:36:34.030
Today they want this, tomorrow they want that.

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:45.810
All the time there’s a competition for materialistic
things: asking for this, asking for that.

00:36:45.810 --> 00:36:54.770
Just imagine what a race will be there, after
some years, when they will be just people

00:36:54.770 --> 00:37:02.280
who will be only worried about collecting
things and buying things: buyers and sellers,

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:04.930
nothing else.

00:37:04.930 --> 00:37:15.200
So you have to be very careful with your children
that you do not pamper them, do not get too

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:19.640
much worried about them, do not keep them
on materialistic level.

00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:24.730
Find out: if they are going on a materialistic
level, bring them down.

00:37:24.730 --> 00:37:32.780
It’s very simple to do that and one has
to work it out because we have to save our

00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:34.790
children and their innocence.

00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:46.160
Now for the other Sahaja Yogis who are grown
up and who are very mature: they are very

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:48.430
innocent, I must say, I must admit that.

00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:53.800
They are very innocent compared to the society
that is around, no doubt.

00:37:53.800 --> 00:38:01.430
One has to really admire the way they have
become so innocent, the way they are understanding

00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:07.390
this divine music and all – it’s really
creditable.

00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:17.460
But still, this innocence, if it is not spread,
if this innocence doesn’t work out, then

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:20.670
it will rust, will not grow.

00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:25.420
Your IQ will be less than the others, I can
tell you this much.

00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:29.530
They are growing in materialism all right.

00:38:29.530 --> 00:38:38.370
Their IQ is growing in materialisms, but your
IQ will not grow unless and until you spread

00:38:38.370 --> 00:38:40.400
this innocence around.

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:44.980
Now you know how to do it.

00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:50.020
It is the power of Kundalini with the help
of Shri Ganesh.

00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:51.480
He helps you at every chakra.

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:57.900
I have written that He is the Vice-Chancellor
of every university, where He has to stamp.

00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:00.300
He’s at every point.

00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:07.090
But you have to understand that this has to
spread.

00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:08.510
It has to become collective.

00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:13.630
It has to flow.

00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:22.080
So to become that, what should we do ourselves?

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:30.360
That we should try to organise programmes.

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:34.970
While people will be enamoured by your innocence,
no doubt.

00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:38.760
They’ll be surprised – how are you so
innocent?

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:42.690
How can you be so nice in these modern times?

00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:45.000
No doubt about it.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:50.890
But, in that doing that, try to be innocent
yourself.

00:39:50.890 --> 00:39:52.870
You should not be cunning.

00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:54.450
You should not be smart.

00:39:54.450 --> 00:40:00.850
You should not try to show that you are very
brilliant or anything because the ego might

00:40:00.850 --> 00:40:05.900
come in between and try to put ideas into
your head.

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:13.080
It’s better to show that you are innocent
and to be innocent inside.

00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:22.970
The whole inner being can be really charged
with the energy of Shri Ganesh, no doubt.

00:40:22.970 --> 00:40:29.040
And the outer life becomes innocent; becomes
innocent.

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:32.050
I mean, I don’t know banking.

00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:33.080
I don’t know money.

00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:37.530
I am quite bad at everything, at worldly things.

00:40:37.530 --> 00:40:46.970
But I am not cunning, I am not ‘smart’,
you can say.

00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:54.900
But still things are working out because of
the inner power that one has.

00:40:54.900 --> 00:41:00.770
So depend on your inner power and manifest
it outside.

00:41:00.770 --> 00:41:08.240
Inner being, which is Ganesha, is the same
in all of us.

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:11.740
The whole system is the same in all of us.

00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:14.310
Chakras are the same in all of us.

00:41:14.310 --> 00:41:26.670
Only thing, we have to keep our innocence
absolutely free of all this worldly nonsense,

00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:31.500
like fashion, this, that.

00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:38.460
Immediately you will find that your being
will manifest; being will manifest.

00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:41.520
Now just think of simple thing like that.

00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:52.080
I am an Indian and nobody knows me but whenever
I have my lecture, I have at least five to

00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:53.260
six thousand people.

00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:54.260
How?

00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:58.460
How do they come to my lecture like that?

00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:00.630
Anywhere in the whole world.

00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:01.630
Minimum.

00:42:01.630 --> 00:42:03.430
Sometimes even much more.

00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:09.370
What’s so special?

00:42:09.370 --> 00:42:16.800
So when handling the people – we are Sahaja
Yogis, we are saints – we have to talk to

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:24.690
them like saints, we have to behave like saints.

00:42:24.690 --> 00:42:30.780
And they should in no way feel that we are
cunning or we are interested in something

00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:33.440
else.

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:43.250
So, once you start doing that, flowing your
innocence all the Gods and Goddesses will

00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:44.250
help you.

00:42:44.250 --> 00:42:55.530
Your creativity will be thousand times more
than normal.

00:42:55.530 --> 00:42:57.980
Everybody has to think how we are going to
spread it.

00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:03.030
Like I was happy to know that in America,
of all the places, they have got hold of these

00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:04.030
senators.

00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:05.710
Very good idea.

00:43:05.710 --> 00:43:10.390
Let us see if it works out.

00:43:10.390 --> 00:43:21.420
So we have to find out all the ways and methods
and all the styles which will behove a saint,

00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:25.420
not a politician.

00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:28.020
These days, of course, all the sports people
are heroes.

00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:33.210
If you want to become a hero, you become a
sportsman.

00:43:33.210 --> 00:43:36.470
Not like that, but like a saint.

00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:45.090
And saintliness is respected, whatever may
be the situation, whatever may be the situation,

00:43:45.090 --> 00:43:47.210
whosoever may be facing you.

00:43:47.210 --> 00:43:53.900
Recently when I was in Kiev, the leaders wife
told me that, “Mother, we had that old car

00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:59.380
of yours, which we sold and we got so much
money that we could buy a new car.

00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:04.210
Then we went to the factory to buy the new
car."

00:44:04.210 --> 00:44:06.220
And they bought it.

00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:08.670
So outside the factory there’s a mafia.

00:44:08.670 --> 00:44:14.300
Nowadays I think the Sicilians have reached
there!

00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:20.610
So the mafia was standing outside and they
said, “You have to pay so much money to

00:44:20.610 --> 00:44:21.610
us."

00:44:21.610 --> 00:44:22.690
In thousands!

00:44:22.690 --> 00:44:24.830
So they said, “We have no money."

00:44:24.830 --> 00:44:25.960
“Why?

00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:27.810
What do you do?”

00:44:27.810 --> 00:44:28.880
This was his wife.

00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:31.620
She said, “We meditate."

00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:32.620
“Really?

00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:33.620
So you have no money."

00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:34.620
“No."

00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:35.620
“What about those children?”

00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:36.620
“They also meditate."

00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:42.460
So innocently she was talking to them, they
said that, “We saw their faces melting down."

00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:45.750
They said, “All right.

00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:46.750
Go!”

00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:51.450
They forgot that they were supposed to get
money out of them!

00:44:51.450 --> 00:44:55.390
Or they take the car, they confiscate the
car or take the money.

00:44:55.390 --> 00:44:57.050
They said, “All right.

00:44:57.050 --> 00:44:58.050
Go!”

00:44:58.050 --> 00:44:59.050
They told me this story.

00:44:59.050 --> 00:45:02.640
So your simplicity always helps you.

00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:05.960
Your innocence always helps you.

00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:10.600
And it has such an impact, such an impact.

00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:19.680
I tell you that a personality, what we call
in Sanskrit is a ‘vigraha’.

00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:24.630
‘Vigraha’ means a personality which has
a coefficience.

00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:36.530
The person who is innocent has such a great
coefficience that he can charm anybody.

00:45:36.530 --> 00:45:44.550
But, first and foremost thing [is] that we
have to be innocent: not to so much worry

00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:55.920
about money, not to count everything, not
to worry about food.

00:45:55.920 --> 00:46:00.500
But this is not to be done with deliberations
but innocence.

00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:06.300
Where you sleep, what you do is not important
to a saint.

00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:13.420
It lives the way one has to live because his
nourishing point is innocence.

00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:20.200
And he doesn’t get angry, he doesn’t shout
at people.

00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:21.200
Nothing!

00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:27.880
Of course, at bhoots it may be that he has
to shout like Christ did, but otherwise, he

00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:33.830
is a very peaceful, joyous, happy, humorous
person.

00:46:33.830 --> 00:46:41.921
So today, at this puja, I would bless you
with all the qualities of Shri Ganesha – except

00:46:41.921 --> 00:46:42.921
for His anger!

00:46:42.921 --> 00:46:44.740
May God bless you.
