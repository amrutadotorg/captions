WEBVTT

01:23.090 --> 01:40.270
Today we have gathered here to do Shri Ganesha
puja.

01:40.270 --> 01:58.170
The first Deity that was created by the Adi
Shakti was Shri Ganesh because it was necessary

01:58.170 --> 02:12.300
first to create the Deity of principles.

02:12.300 --> 02:31.910
The deity of principle in the sense that whatever
is created, whatever is there as called ‘bhava’

02:31.910 --> 02:38.760
– whatever has been so far created – up
to human level.

02:38.760 --> 02:58.530
Everything had to be through the implanted
mechanism of energy otherwise nothing could

02:58.530 --> 03:05.190
have been created.

03:05.190 --> 03:15.640
If you go into the matter, say sulphur dioxide,
then sulphur and oxide — go on deep into

03:15.640 --> 03:25.579
it till you reach the state when it is a molecule
— then you see these atoms of sulphur and

03:25.579 --> 03:30.280
oxygen, they oscillate.

03:30.280 --> 03:33.750
They oscillate with a frequency.

03:33.750 --> 03:41.040
There are three types of frequencies they
use.

03:41.040 --> 03:52.420
Now imagine in the molecule – think of it
– in the molecule of a substance there is

03:52.420 --> 03:57.510
an energy which is acting.

03:57.510 --> 04:03.810
Now one may say that, “Why should be in
matter there is energy?”

04:03.810 --> 04:16.630
One can ask a question, why there should be
energy in matter.

04:16.630 --> 04:27.669
If there was no energy in the matter, how
can you have all chemical compounds?

04:27.669 --> 04:29.760
Who pushes them?

04:29.760 --> 04:37.840
Say you have sodium chloride – sodium and
chloride are attached to each other.

04:37.840 --> 04:46.180
But if the chloride has to go to some other
atom then who does that?

04:46.180 --> 05:03.180
There has to be some energy which is absolutely
inbuilt into matter.

05:03.180 --> 05:17.740
Now, we may say that, “What about water?”

05:17.740 --> 05:24.750
You know water has energy, that’s how we
have hydrostatics.

05:24.750 --> 05:36.389
Even coal, even stones, all of them have got
energy within themselves.

05:36.389 --> 05:43.660
And it is all controlled by the principle
of Shri Ganesh.

05:43.660 --> 05:53.710
So, though He’s such a small, little, tiny,
little child, how great is His work and how

05:53.710 --> 05:55.389
much He has to work out.

05:55.389 --> 06:04.590
Now from matter, you move, say, to living
plants, then to animals, then to human beings

06:04.590 --> 06:07.910
and everywhere His energy works.

06:07.910 --> 06:16.669
At the level of matter, they might call it
‘electromagnetic’ but potentially it is

06:16.669 --> 06:22.680
the energy of Shri Ganesh, which is electromagnetic
at that point.

06:22.680 --> 06:27.270
Then it starts evolving, growing.

06:27.270 --> 06:40.080
That’s how we have different stratas of
energies that we see in different growth of

06:40.080 --> 06:46.220
the evolution.

06:46.220 --> 07:05.740
In the human being it exists, as you know,
as auspiciousness, as purity, mainly the innocence.

07:05.740 --> 07:13.639
So the power of innocence is such a guiding
factor.

07:13.639 --> 07:21.770
There’s a difference between ignorance and
innocence.

07:21.770 --> 07:37.819
If you are innocent then, to you, nothing
is important except for love.

07:37.819 --> 07:48.240
For an innocent person – who is not conditioned,
who is not egoistical, who is not so-called

07:48.240 --> 07:56.960
matured – it is the love that it understands.

07:56.960 --> 08:14.870
It doesn’t care for any wealth, any power,
anything but the love that it can feel, the

08:14.870 --> 08:20.389
pure love of a person.

08:20.389 --> 08:33.409
Innocent person has no understanding of gaining
anything out of the love he receives or he

08:33.409 --> 08:38.210
gives; no sense at all.

08:38.210 --> 08:44.540
Innocence is the basis of all the dharmas.

08:44.540 --> 08:58.230
If you have no innocence you cannot follow
dharma because if you are dharmic it is maybe

08:58.230 --> 09:07.010
your mental attitude, maybe egoistical, maybe
because you are born in a religion or because

09:07.010 --> 09:09.470
somebody has told you about it.

09:09.470 --> 09:14.810
It’s going to be very superficial.

09:14.810 --> 09:24.680
Unless and until it is embedded in the quality
of innocence dharma has no meaning.

09:24.680 --> 09:27.790
In that state you are dharmic.

09:27.790 --> 09:37.280
You are beyond any thinking about it, of any
deductions about it.

09:37.280 --> 09:38.280
But you are dharmic.

09:38.280 --> 09:39.680
You cannot be adharmic.

09:39.680 --> 09:44.530
You cannot be.

09:44.530 --> 09:52.069
As if the manifestation of innocence is morality.

09:52.069 --> 10:01.730
Once Shri Ganesha is awakened — I hope He
has been awakened in all of you — and if

10:01.730 --> 10:11.870
you respect Him, just respect Him, then automatically
you develop a sense of morality.

10:11.870 --> 10:15.510
I don’t have to tell you.

10:15.510 --> 10:18.580
I don’t have to explain to you.

10:18.580 --> 10:24.040
You just become moral.

10:24.040 --> 10:31.030
People who have seen you are quite amazed
and said that, “How is it that their eyes

10:31.030 --> 10:37.300
are fixed, so innocent, without any lust and
greed?”

10:37.300 --> 10:49.400
It’s the light of Shri Ganesha from the
Back Agnya, Front Agnya; the Jesus Christ,

10:49.400 --> 10:58.030
who is the manifestation of Shri Ganesha.

10:58.030 --> 11:03.640
It is impossible for [the] Western mind to
understand that Jesus Christ was purity.

11:03.640 --> 11:06.690
They can’t understand.

11:06.690 --> 11:10.740
And they have criticised Him and said horrible
things against Him.

11:10.740 --> 11:15.069
But somehow He’s forgiving them.

11:15.069 --> 11:27.820
But one thing about Shri Ganesh is that He
worships His Mother.

11:27.820 --> 11:44.320
Motherhood is very important: motherhood in
the women, motherhood in the father and also

11:44.320 --> 12:01.030
in the children has to be accepted as the
mainstay of family life and society.

12:01.030 --> 12:16.700
The ordinary life of a human being, [of] very
simple, innocent, simple people, revolves

12:16.700 --> 12:20.590
around the mother.

12:20.590 --> 12:23.189
It revolves.

12:23.189 --> 12:26.190
But the mothers have to be mothers.

12:26.190 --> 12:42.390
As Shri Ganesha is so much surrendered to
His Mother and who is His Mother?

12:42.390 --> 12:44.179
Is Adi Shakti.

12:44.179 --> 12:46.809
He does not know anybody else.

12:46.809 --> 12:52.459
He just knows His Mother.

12:52.459 --> 13:03.910
This is extremely important in Sahaj Yog.

13:03.910 --> 13:20.770
As we say, there are immoral human beings
and they are doing immoral things because

13:20.770 --> 13:31.560
they are committing sin against the Adi Shakti.

13:31.560 --> 13:44.270
Committing sin against Ganesha they may be
forgiven but committing sin against the Adi

13:44.270 --> 13:59.190
Shakti…It encompasses a very big area where
we start seeing how we are committing the

13:59.190 --> 14:09.280
sin against the Adi Shakti which, ultimately,
Shri Ganesha punishes, ultimately.

14:09.280 --> 14:23.250
Actually, the Adi Shakti doesn’t punish
anyone, the Deities only punish them.

14:23.250 --> 14:38.670
First and foremost thing that is to be understood
[is] that innocence should be respected, looked

14:38.670 --> 14:44.130
after, nourished and protected.

14:44.130 --> 14:50.980
That’s why I am very particular about the
children.

14:50.980 --> 14:57.290
Children should not be exposed to the public.

14:57.290 --> 15:04.610
We should not try to make photographs out
of our children and expose them in the newspaper

15:04.610 --> 15:08.760
or give them for advertisement or anything
there.

15:08.760 --> 15:25.910
It’s a very wrong idea to expose your children
to gain some money out of them: in any way,

15:25.910 --> 15:28.690
in the smallest way also.

15:28.690 --> 15:34.959
Because we are selling the innocence, the
innocence which is invaluable, writ large

15:34.959 --> 15:40.220
on the children.

15:40.220 --> 15:49.680
Many children I know, who have been advertised
and all that, specially in India have died.

15:49.680 --> 15:57.440
Also we have to look after our children with
great care.

15:57.440 --> 16:02.160
But we go to two extremes, I have seen.

16:02.160 --> 16:05.689
Some people are only worried about their own
children – if anything happens to them [they]

16:05.689 --> 16:10.890
just get upset.

16:10.890 --> 16:15.289
That means you are respecting your child because
he’s your child.

16:15.289 --> 16:22.299
But if you are respecting him because he carries
innocence with him, then you have to respect

16:22.299 --> 16:31.200
every child and understand every child: what
they talk, what they say, how they behave.

16:31.200 --> 16:34.689
Luckily, you all have got children now who
are born-realised.

16:34.689 --> 16:37.339
It’s such a great thing!

16:37.339 --> 16:39.980
It’s such a blessing!

16:39.980 --> 16:45.069
So on one side, we have to see how innocent
they are and how they talk.

16:45.069 --> 16:48.290
I’ll give you an example.

16:48.290 --> 16:57.630
Wolfgang was very serious and his wife told
me that we were taking him to the hospital,

16:57.630 --> 17:01.730
so his daughter says, “Why are you taking
him to the hospital?

17:01.730 --> 17:04.089
There are no Sahaja Yogis there!

17:04.089 --> 17:08.249
How will they correct his chakras?”

17:08.249 --> 17:09.919
Innocently said the correct thing.

17:09.919 --> 17:10.919
And they couldn’t do.

17:10.919 --> 17:12.530
Doctors didn’t do anything.

17:12.530 --> 17:14.870
I had to cure him!

17:14.870 --> 17:16.699
“Take him to Mother!

17:16.699 --> 17:19.420
Why are you taking him to the hospital?”

17:19.420 --> 17:27.329
They see the right point and say the right
thing because they are innocent and innocence

17:27.329 --> 17:30.850
means they have pure attention.

17:30.850 --> 17:39.200
Pure attention, for anything, you need: say
[for] music, for art.

17:39.200 --> 17:47.330
For anything you have to have pure attention
and that comes through your innocence.

17:47.330 --> 17:54.380
Say a person who is an artist and who is very
money-oriented, for example, a person who

17:54.380 --> 18:00.620
is doing some paintings and all that: his
art cannot become eternal art.

18:00.620 --> 18:01.620
Cannot.

18:01.620 --> 18:06.390
That’s why we see in modern times [that],
whatever art is created, it just comes and

18:06.390 --> 18:07.390
goes.

18:07.390 --> 18:11.030
It has no eternal value.

18:11.030 --> 18:13.630
Same with the modern music that they are having.

18:13.630 --> 18:15.180
The same thing is happening.

18:15.180 --> 18:24.059
It comes and goes and no one knows where it
has disappeared.

18:24.059 --> 18:37.519
Behind it is money orientation and that money
orientation results into a kind of a creation

18:37.519 --> 18:42.830
which is not perfect.

18:42.830 --> 18:51.799
All creations which were dedicated to God
in the olden times are being today very much

18:51.799 --> 18:54.580
respected and people pay a lot of money for
that.

18:54.580 --> 19:00.860
Maybe, at that time, the artist must have
suffered, but they understood, innocent artists

19:00.860 --> 19:12.240
understood very much, that if we have to express,
we must truthfully do it.

19:12.240 --> 19:17.710
Not to please the people, not to please anyone,
but to please God.

19:17.710 --> 19:23.860
As you know that Michelangelo had a big fight
with this pope here because he couldn’t

19:23.860 --> 19:27.909
tolerate nonsense that was coming from the
pope.

19:27.909 --> 19:33.130
All the artists always have been fighting
— real artists.

19:33.130 --> 19:37.730
So this innocence also gives you a power of
self-understanding.

19:37.730 --> 19:44.250
You know where you stand.

19:44.250 --> 19:53.909
A person who is innocent knows very well that
he is standing on the pedestal of virtues.

19:53.909 --> 20:01.530
He should not give in to all kinds of nonsensical
things which are very popular, may be fashionable,

20:01.530 --> 20:02.530
may be accepted.

20:02.530 --> 20:04.730
For what?

20:04.730 --> 20:11.370
For what are we going to sacrifice our innocence?

20:11.370 --> 20:15.980
What is our gain?

20:15.980 --> 20:21.840
Maybe some people are too brilliant and they
may try to show off with their brilliance

20:21.840 --> 20:28.509
for a short time but they don’t remain in
the eternal history.

20:28.509 --> 20:38.250
They go as egoistical people or as very dishonest
people.

20:38.250 --> 20:39.810
Nobody respects them.

20:39.810 --> 20:55.860
So there is a big attack on the innocence
of people, a big attack.

20:55.860 --> 20:57.330
First it comes on children.

20:57.330 --> 21:03.730
As you see, this nonsense that is going on
which we hear about — I mean, I can’t

21:03.730 --> 21:06.450
even understand why they do it.

21:06.450 --> 21:13.370
They do it on children, these funny attacks
of abuses.

21:13.370 --> 21:19.640
It’s just because they want to kill the
innocence.

21:19.640 --> 21:26.580
Perhaps those who do it have no innocence
in them and they don’t want the children

21:26.580 --> 21:30.140
to have any innocence left in them.

21:30.140 --> 21:33.809
Otherwise, in India it’s something we can’t
understand.

21:33.809 --> 21:36.110
Really, we can’t understand.

21:36.110 --> 21:43.690
But it is becoming much more prevalent, much
more fashionable now because there is definitely

21:43.690 --> 21:56.230
an attack on innocence; not only on children
but even on people who are innocent.

21:56.230 --> 22:07.740
Because those who have deliberations in criminality,
in all kinds of sinful acts will never, never

22:07.740 --> 22:11.049
try to protect innocence, never!

22:11.049 --> 22:15.320
Because the juxtaposition is there.

22:15.320 --> 22:18.830
They are doing something which they think
is the best.

22:18.830 --> 22:21.070
I don’t know if they think that way.

22:21.070 --> 22:27.919
But I don’t know what justifies their behaviour
like this – is to attack the innocence of

22:27.919 --> 22:30.960
children.

22:30.960 --> 22:36.600
In so many ways, you will find [that] this
innocence is being attacked.

22:36.600 --> 22:45.179
If your children are doing well, if they are
studying well, somebody might try to catch

22:45.179 --> 22:47.730
hold of them.

22:47.730 --> 22:57.610
If some person they find is an innocent person,
they will try to put him into trouble.

22:57.610 --> 23:10.149
The innocence itself is such a power that
it challenges the hatred, the abusive nature

23:10.149 --> 23:11.740
of people.

23:11.740 --> 23:24.190
First of all, we should see how our conditioning
takes over our innocence.

23:24.190 --> 23:26.210
It makes you extremely ritualistic.

23:26.210 --> 23:49.700
Even in Sahaja Yoga, I have seen – I have
heard also – that people are extremely ritualistic.

23:49.700 --> 23:56.820
Now the ritualism is like this: that you have
to say something three times, you say it three

23:56.820 --> 24:01.919
times, seven times like tied up people.

24:01.919 --> 24:06.399
I have seen some some Sahaja Yogis like that.

24:06.399 --> 24:13.429
And some Sahaj Yogis, I think they must be
bhootish, get frightened with me.

24:13.429 --> 24:15.259
What is there to be frightened of me?

24:15.259 --> 24:21.379
Because they are bhootish, they are getting
frightened.

24:21.379 --> 24:23.389
Otherwise why should you?

24:23.389 --> 24:31.860
I love you all and you won’t find a greater
mild guru than myself.

24:31.860 --> 24:36.340
I don’t think so!

24:36.340 --> 24:38.009
But they are afraid.

24:38.009 --> 24:41.509
Even if you look at them they’ll not smile,
they’ll be afraid.

24:41.509 --> 24:42.690
What wrong have you done?

24:42.690 --> 24:45.400
You have become Sahaja Yogis!

24:45.400 --> 24:49.529
They are so ritualistic in everything!

24:49.529 --> 24:56.340
So one should understand a difference between
a protocol and ritualism.

24:56.340 --> 25:01.179
An innocent child knows the protocol.

25:01.179 --> 25:09.740
I remember there was a child who came to see
me in Oxted and I said, “Let’s go upstairs!”

25:09.740 --> 25:13.980
So it was a small, little staircase of wood.

25:13.980 --> 25:16.110
He said, “What?

25:16.110 --> 25:21.130
Is She going to go up without a red carpet?”

25:21.130 --> 25:25.580
This came into his head!

25:25.580 --> 25:33.869
So for children, innocent children, the worship,
everything is not ritualistic, it is heartfelt.

25:33.869 --> 25:46.559
You feel it from the heart: how to do the
worship, how to show your love.

25:46.559 --> 26:00.620
It’s very sweet [the] way an innocent person
does it, while a person who is very ritualistic,

26:00.620 --> 26:06.460
he may even beat another person because, “Why
did you do this?

26:06.460 --> 26:08.730
You should not have put camphor in it?

26:08.730 --> 26:10.019
Why did you put the camphor?

26:10.019 --> 26:12.529
So, it’s very wrong."

26:12.529 --> 26:14.409
There’s nothing wrong.

26:14.409 --> 26:24.769
If you do it with your heart, with your open
heart, innocently – anything is all right.

26:24.769 --> 26:32.759
It is the open heart which is necessary, not
the closed heart – “Why did you do it?

26:32.759 --> 26:34.519
Why didn’t you do it.

26:34.519 --> 26:36.460
Where did you sit?

26:36.460 --> 26:37.460
What happened?”

26:37.460 --> 26:38.460
Nothing!

26:38.460 --> 26:45.320
Now you are in the kingdom of God and here
there are no such rules and regulations that

26:45.320 --> 26:47.419
you should be ritualistic.

26:47.419 --> 26:50.990
But everything has a double style.

26:50.990 --> 27:00.040
Now I say, you need not be ritualistic so:
once I went into an ashram.

27:00.040 --> 27:03.330
I found everything was just like a pigsty.

27:03.330 --> 27:05.980
I said, “What’s this?

27:05.980 --> 27:09.020
Is this an ashram or what is it?”

27:09.020 --> 27:17.259
So they said, “Mother, you told us that
you have to be innocent and you don’t have

27:17.259 --> 27:20.080
to be ritualistic.

27:20.080 --> 27:23.549
So we thought, ‘Throw all the things wherever
you feel like.

27:23.549 --> 27:25.320
What is there to be ritualistic?’

27:25.320 --> 27:28.650
” It’s a very common thing.

27:28.650 --> 27:36.320
All the ashram leaders tell me that Sahaja
Yogis have no sense at all of looking after

27:36.320 --> 27:38.360
the cleanliness of the ashram.

27:38.360 --> 27:40.629
They are least bothered.

27:40.629 --> 27:46.720
If it is their house, they look after, but
if it is an ashram they do not.

27:46.720 --> 27:49.090
It’s very surprising!

27:49.090 --> 27:55.019
And I have seen, or I have heard, that the
ashrams all of bhootish and false gurus are

27:55.019 --> 27:56.769
absolutely spick-and-span!

27:56.769 --> 27:58.929
Really!

27:58.929 --> 28:05.429
It’s very surprising.

28:05.429 --> 28:15.610
And, even here in Cabella, people were telling
me that they are living like animals.

28:15.610 --> 28:20.590
I said, “Animals are innocent, you know!”

28:20.590 --> 28:23.120
You go into a jungle, now — I don’t know,
we are going to take you this time (on India

28:23.120 --> 28:31.119
Tour to Kanha National Park) into a jungle
— you will have no smell, no horrid things

28:31.119 --> 28:32.299
to see, nothing.

28:32.299 --> 28:35.120
It’s very clean, spick-and-span, all the
time.

28:35.120 --> 28:42.639
But [if] you put one human being, you will
immediately know there has been a human being.

28:42.639 --> 28:46.279
They have their own systems of keeping things
clean.

28:46.279 --> 28:53.610
Even the tiger, who is an innocent thing — up
to animal stage you are innocent — he has

28:53.610 --> 28:54.870
his own styles.

28:54.870 --> 29:02.320
I don’t know if you know about a tiger or
not, but a tiger will kill an animal because

29:02.320 --> 29:04.120
he has to eat, after all.

29:04.120 --> 29:06.379
He supposed to only eat animals, he doesn’t
eat grass.

29:06.379 --> 29:07.379
What to do?

29:07.379 --> 29:09.799
He’s not a vegetarian!

29:09.799 --> 29:15.049
God has made him like that so he accepts.

29:15.049 --> 29:24.129
Now he goes and kills the cow or anything
then he leaves his kill there for the blood

29:24.129 --> 29:25.159
to ooze out.

29:25.159 --> 29:30.480
Nobody will touch that, nobody, because he’s
really the king.

29:30.480 --> 29:34.489
Not out of fear but a protocol.

29:34.489 --> 29:39.629
Then next day he goes [back], he eats, then
his family eats and all that; then finished

29:39.629 --> 29:43.700
for the whole month; they come out.

29:43.700 --> 29:48.710
Then the lower animals start going there.

29:48.710 --> 30:03.029
Like you have

30:03.029 --> 30:07.630
leopards and all these animals come out and
they start eating.

30:07.630 --> 30:11.629
And then even lower and lower till the birds.

30:11.629 --> 30:15.570
Still the crow, they stay back.

30:15.570 --> 30:19.110
Last are crows.

30:19.110 --> 30:22.659
Can you imagine?

30:22.659 --> 30:25.890
Such a system they have!

30:25.890 --> 30:36.010
They go all the way from Siberia to Australia.

30:36.010 --> 30:37.340
How do they manage?

30:37.340 --> 30:39.169
Think of it.

30:39.169 --> 30:43.039
What gives them direction is innocence.

30:43.039 --> 30:46.529
And the innocence is a magnet.

30:46.529 --> 30:48.419
It’s a magnet.

30:48.419 --> 30:50.929
Actually it’s a magnet.

30:50.929 --> 30:57.490
In a human being you do not find a magnet
because it has now evolved so much, but it

30:57.490 --> 31:00.909
starts just like a magnet.

31:00.909 --> 31:04.730
So they know which is north, which is south,
east and west.

31:04.730 --> 31:09.899
Even a little bee, you find and put a mark
on it.

31:09.899 --> 31:15.919
It goes to the place from where it has come.

31:15.919 --> 31:21.100
How does it find its own way?

31:21.100 --> 31:27.960
Is the innocence [which] is like a magnet,
acts like a magnet.

31:27.960 --> 31:30.080
Even in the fishes.

31:30.080 --> 31:32.360
Just imagine how fishes have direction!

31:32.360 --> 31:36.390
We don’t have — I mean, human beings can
be lost.

31:36.390 --> 31:47.480
Many times I am lost with so many drivers
I have had! (laughter) So many times I have

31:47.480 --> 31:55.549
been lost but animals never.

31:55.549 --> 32:07.429
You know, if you take a dog and you don’t
want the dog, you leave him about fifty miles

32:07.429 --> 32:10.850
away, he’ll come back.

32:10.850 --> 32:15.279
How does he find the way?

32:15.279 --> 32:25.950
So their qualities, which are built-in within
them through their innocence, are actually

32:25.950 --> 32:34.869
the qualities of the electromagnetic force
and also pranava: that is when electromagnetic

32:34.869 --> 32:39.869
force is charged with Ganesha’s Principle.

32:39.869 --> 32:50.340
That’s why they are so systematic, they
are so clean, they are so sensible.

32:50.340 --> 32:56.640
But they are not ritualistic.

32:56.640 --> 33:01.330
They are not ritualistic.

33:01.330 --> 33:04.909
Whatever God has given them, they have accepted.

33:04.909 --> 33:07.519
They are bound by that.

33:07.519 --> 33:13.470
They are bound and they live with that boundary.

33:13.470 --> 33:21.279
Even if you go up to the stage of animals
which live with human beings, they too, are

33:21.279 --> 33:22.840
very affectionate.

33:22.840 --> 33:27.460
They just want love, nothing else.

33:27.460 --> 33:33.049
One day if you do not care for your dog, he
will just not eat his food, not eat his food,

33:33.049 --> 33:36.720
he wouldn’t care for the food.

33:36.720 --> 33:45.150
It is so remarkable, even I have seen among
children how they just want love.

33:45.150 --> 33:48.559
They don’t accept anything else but love.

33:48.559 --> 33:56.299
But as soon as they start growing up, specially
in a materialistic world, then the whole materialism

33:56.299 --> 33:58.690
comes in.

33:58.690 --> 34:07.150
So the second way we kill our children’s
innocence is putting materialistic ideas into

34:07.150 --> 34:09.010
their heads.

34:09.010 --> 34:15.679
Of course, the media is there which is selling,
nowadays, a teddy bear which has a birthday.

34:15.679 --> 34:18.000
Teddy bear has a birthday!

34:18.000 --> 34:20.149
Can you imagine?

34:20.149 --> 34:23.690
So everybody is buying teddy bear with a birthday.

34:23.690 --> 34:29.740
Because the parents don’t want to be in
the company of children so they get some sort

34:29.740 --> 34:35.190
of a toys — this, that, one or two is alright
— and put them with the toys, with the television

34:35.190 --> 34:36.310
on.

34:36.310 --> 34:39.670
“Now, sit down!”

34:39.670 --> 34:43.669
Children start becoming naturally materialistic.

34:43.669 --> 34:59.300
They start asking for things and for demands
of such kind that sometimes one is surprised.

34:59.300 --> 35:05.570
You take a Western child to the market and
you’ve had it!

35:05.570 --> 35:09.350
But you take Indian children, they’ll never
take anything.

35:09.350 --> 35:10.350
Really!

35:10.350 --> 35:11.609
It’s so difficult to make them.

35:11.609 --> 35:15.260
At least, I have seen my own grandchildren
and other.

35:15.260 --> 35:18.940
You take them: it’s a headache to buy even
another pair of shoes for them.

35:18.940 --> 35:20.290
“No, but we have one.

35:20.290 --> 35:22.460
Why do you want to buy another?”

35:22.460 --> 35:23.460
“Oh baba!

35:23.460 --> 35:24.460
That will give way!”

35:24.460 --> 35:25.710
“No, we can come here."

35:25.710 --> 35:26.710
“How?”

35:26.710 --> 35:28.850
“We can come in the car or else we can walk."

35:28.850 --> 35:31.340
“But you will have no shoes [to walk]!”

35:31.340 --> 35:32.340
“Nothing!

35:32.340 --> 35:33.340
One is alright.

35:33.340 --> 35:34.340
Why to have two?”

35:34.340 --> 35:40.890
You give them money, they’ll buy one small
little thing and come home.

35:40.890 --> 35:52.330
You see, it is the whole tradition of materialism
which has brought this innocence to a stop.

35:52.330 --> 35:56.890
Then a child starts growing in the same materialistic
way.

35:56.890 --> 36:04.450
He starts judging people like, “How many
cars you have?”

36:04.450 --> 36:05.450
You see?

36:05.450 --> 36:12.200
They are so stupidly materialistic that I
went to Boston and the television people asked

36:12.200 --> 36:14.310
me, “How many Rolls Royces you have?”

36:14.310 --> 36:16.320
I said, “I don’t have any."

36:16.320 --> 36:17.870
They said, “We are not interested.

36:17.870 --> 36:21.650
You are not in the business!”

36:21.650 --> 36:29.520
This is what is now the mind of people in
the West who have grown up.

36:29.520 --> 36:31.810
But even the children!

36:31.810 --> 36:34.030
Today they want this, tomorrow they want that.

36:34.030 --> 36:45.810
All the time there’s a competition for materialistic
things: asking for this, asking for that.

36:45.810 --> 36:54.770
Just imagine what a race will be there, after
some years, when they will be just people

36:54.770 --> 37:02.280
who will be only worried about collecting
things and buying things: buyers and sellers,

37:02.280 --> 37:04.930
nothing else.

37:04.930 --> 37:15.200
So you have to be very careful with your children
that you do not pamper them, do not get too

37:15.200 --> 37:19.640
much worried about them, do not keep them
on materialistic level.

37:19.640 --> 37:24.730
Find out: if they are going on a materialistic
level, bring them down.

37:24.730 --> 37:32.780
It’s very simple to do that and one has
to work it out because we have to save our

37:32.780 --> 37:34.790
children and their innocence.

37:34.790 --> 37:46.160
Now for the other Sahaja Yogis who are grown
up and who are very mature: they are very

37:46.160 --> 37:48.430
innocent, I must say, I must admit that.

37:48.430 --> 37:53.800
They are very innocent compared to the society
that is around, no doubt.

37:53.800 --> 38:01.430
One has to really admire the way they have
become so innocent, the way they are understanding

38:01.430 --> 38:07.390
this divine music and all – it’s really
creditable.

38:07.390 --> 38:17.460
But still, this innocence, if it is not spread,
if this innocence doesn’t work out, then

38:17.460 --> 38:20.670
it will rust, will not grow.

38:20.670 --> 38:25.420
Your IQ will be less than the others, I can
tell you this much.

38:25.420 --> 38:29.530
They are growing in materialism all right.

38:29.530 --> 38:38.370
Their IQ is growing in materialisms, but your
IQ will not grow unless and until you spread

38:38.370 --> 38:40.400
this innocence around.

38:40.400 --> 38:44.980
Now you know how to do it.

38:44.980 --> 38:50.020
It is the power of Kundalini with the help
of Shri Ganesh.

38:50.020 --> 38:51.480
He helps you at every chakra.

38:51.480 --> 38:57.900
I have written that He is the Vice-Chancellor
of every university, where He has to stamp.

38:57.900 --> 39:00.300
He’s at every point.

39:00.300 --> 39:07.090
But you have to understand that this has to
spread.

39:07.090 --> 39:08.510
It has to become collective.

39:08.510 --> 39:13.630
It has to flow.

39:13.630 --> 39:22.080
So to become that, what should we do ourselves?

39:22.080 --> 39:30.360
That we should try to organise programmes.

39:30.360 --> 39:34.970
While people will be enamoured by your innocence,
no doubt.

39:34.970 --> 39:38.760
They’ll be surprised – how are you so
innocent?

39:38.760 --> 39:42.690
How can you be so nice in these modern times?

39:42.690 --> 39:45.000
No doubt about it.

39:45.000 --> 39:50.890
But, in that doing that, try to be innocent
yourself.

39:50.890 --> 39:52.870
You should not be cunning.

39:52.870 --> 39:54.450
You should not be smart.

39:54.450 --> 40:00.850
You should not try to show that you are very
brilliant or anything because the ego might

40:00.850 --> 40:05.900
come in between and try to put ideas into
your head.

40:05.900 --> 40:13.080
It’s better to show that you are innocent
and to be innocent inside.

40:13.080 --> 40:22.970
The whole inner being can be really charged
with the energy of Shri Ganesh, no doubt.

40:22.970 --> 40:29.040
And the outer life becomes innocent; becomes
innocent.

40:29.040 --> 40:32.050
I mean, I don’t know banking.

40:32.050 --> 40:33.080
I don’t know money.

40:33.080 --> 40:37.530
I am quite bad at everything, at worldly things.

40:37.530 --> 40:46.970
But I am not cunning, I am not ‘smart’,
you can say.

40:46.970 --> 40:54.900
But still things are working out because of
the inner power that one has.

40:54.900 --> 41:00.770
So depend on your inner power and manifest
it outside.

41:00.770 --> 41:08.240
Inner being, which is Ganesha, is the same
in all of us.

41:08.240 --> 41:11.740
The whole system is the same in all of us.

41:11.740 --> 41:14.310
Chakras are the same in all of us.

41:14.310 --> 41:26.670
Only thing, we have to keep our innocence
absolutely free of all this worldly nonsense,

41:26.670 --> 41:31.500
like fashion, this, that.

41:31.500 --> 41:38.460
Immediately you will find that your being
will manifest; being will manifest.

41:38.460 --> 41:41.520
Now just think of simple thing like that.

41:41.520 --> 41:52.080
I am an Indian and nobody knows me but whenever
I have my lecture, I have at least five to

41:52.080 --> 41:53.260
six thousand people.

41:53.260 --> 41:54.260
How?

41:54.260 --> 41:58.460
How do they come to my lecture like that?

41:58.460 --> 42:00.630
Anywhere in the whole world.

42:00.630 --> 42:01.630
Minimum.

42:01.630 --> 42:03.430
Sometimes even much more.

42:03.430 --> 42:09.370
What’s so special?

42:09.370 --> 42:16.800
So when handling the people – we are Sahaja
Yogis, we are saints – we have to talk to

42:16.800 --> 42:24.690
them like saints, we have to behave like saints.

42:24.690 --> 42:30.780
And they should in no way feel that we are
cunning or we are interested in something

42:30.780 --> 42:33.440
else.

42:33.440 --> 42:43.250
So, once you start doing that, flowing your
innocence all the Gods and Goddesses will

42:43.250 --> 42:44.250
help you.

42:44.250 --> 42:55.530
Your creativity will be thousand times more
than normal.

42:55.530 --> 42:57.980
Everybody has to think how we are going to
spread it.

42:57.980 --> 43:03.030
Like I was happy to know that in America,
of all the places, they have got hold of these

43:03.030 --> 43:04.030
senators.

43:04.030 --> 43:05.710
Very good idea.

43:05.710 --> 43:10.390
Let us see if it works out.

43:10.390 --> 43:21.420
So we have to find out all the ways and methods
and all the styles which will behove a saint,

43:21.420 --> 43:25.420
not a politician.

43:25.420 --> 43:28.020
These days, of course, all the sports people
are heroes.

43:28.020 --> 43:33.210
If you want to become a hero, you become a
sportsman.

43:33.210 --> 43:36.470
Not like that, but like a saint.

43:36.470 --> 43:45.090
And saintliness is respected, whatever may
be the situation, whatever may be the situation,

43:45.090 --> 43:47.210
whosoever may be facing you.

43:47.210 --> 43:53.900
Recently when I was in Kiev, the leaders wife
told me that, “Mother, we had that old car

43:53.900 --> 43:59.380
of yours, which we sold and we got so much
money that we could buy a new car.

43:59.380 --> 44:04.210
Then we went to the factory to buy the new
car."

44:04.210 --> 44:06.220
And they bought it.

44:06.220 --> 44:08.670
So outside the factory there’s a mafia.

44:08.670 --> 44:14.300
Nowadays I think the Sicilians have reached
there!

44:14.300 --> 44:20.610
So the mafia was standing outside and they
said, “You have to pay so much money to

44:20.610 --> 44:21.610
us."

44:21.610 --> 44:22.690
In thousands!

44:22.690 --> 44:24.830
So they said, “We have no money."

44:24.830 --> 44:25.960
“Why?

44:25.960 --> 44:27.810
What do you do?”

44:27.810 --> 44:28.880
This was his wife.

44:28.880 --> 44:31.620
She said, “We meditate."

44:31.620 --> 44:32.620
“Really?

44:32.620 --> 44:33.620
So you have no money."

44:33.620 --> 44:34.620
“No."

44:34.620 --> 44:35.620
“What about those children?”

44:35.620 --> 44:36.620
“They also meditate."

44:36.620 --> 44:42.460
So innocently she was talking to them, they
said that, “We saw their faces melting down."

44:42.460 --> 44:45.750
They said, “All right.

44:45.750 --> 44:46.750
Go!”

44:46.750 --> 44:51.450
They forgot that they were supposed to get
money out of them!

44:51.450 --> 44:55.390
Or they take the car, they confiscate the
car or take the money.

44:55.390 --> 44:57.050
They said, “All right.

44:57.050 --> 44:58.050
Go!”

44:58.050 --> 44:59.050
They told me this story.

44:59.050 --> 45:02.640
So your simplicity always helps you.

45:02.640 --> 45:05.960
Your innocence always helps you.

45:05.960 --> 45:10.600
And it has such an impact, such an impact.

45:10.600 --> 45:19.680
I tell you that a personality, what we call
in Sanskrit is a ‘vigraha’.

45:19.680 --> 45:24.630
‘Vigraha’ means a personality which has
a coefficience.

45:24.630 --> 45:36.530
The person who is innocent has such a great
coefficience that he can charm anybody.

45:36.530 --> 45:44.550
But, first and foremost thing [is] that we
have to be innocent: not to so much worry

45:44.550 --> 45:55.920
about money, not to count everything, not
to worry about food.

45:55.920 --> 46:00.500
But this is not to be done with deliberations
but innocence.

46:00.500 --> 46:06.300
Where you sleep, what you do is not important
to a saint.

46:06.300 --> 46:13.420
It lives the way one has to live because his
nourishing point is innocence.

46:13.420 --> 46:20.200
And he doesn’t get angry, he doesn’t shout
at people.

46:20.200 --> 46:21.200
Nothing!

46:21.200 --> 46:27.880
Of course, at bhoots it may be that he has
to shout like Christ did, but otherwise, he

46:27.880 --> 46:33.830
is a very peaceful, joyous, happy, humorous
person.

46:33.830 --> 46:41.921
So today, at this puja, I would bless you
with all the qualities of Shri Ganesha – except

46:41.921 --> 46:42.921
for His anger!

46:42.921 --> 46:44.740
May God bless you.
