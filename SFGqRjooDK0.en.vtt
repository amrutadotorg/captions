00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.286
So you reach a state

00:00:08.487 --> 00:00:11.401
where it can be described with the word ‘a’,

00:00:11.602 --> 00:00:14.703
means ‘without’,

00:00:17.641 --> 00:00:20.078
without.

00:00:22.805 --> 00:00:27.474
So such a person

00:00:27.675 --> 00:00:32.065
is without thought; he doesn't think.

00:00:38.971 --> 00:00:42.928
Such a person is without greed,

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:48.441
such a person is without lust - devoid of.

00:00:52.504 --> 00:00:56.670
Such a person is said to be ‘ashesh’-

00:00:56.871 --> 00:01:06.177
out of which nothing is left out.

00:01:06.378 --> 00:01:10.404
Like when you want to make a vacuum,

00:01:10.605 --> 00:01:14.345
you go on making the, creating the vacuum,

00:01:14.546 --> 00:01:19.147
reach any point and the vacuum cannot be complete

00:01:19.348 --> 00:01:23.072
because it reaches a point all the time

00:01:23.273 --> 00:01:27.892
where you find some part of it has to be remained.

00:01:28.093 --> 00:01:31.796
You cannot have a complete vacuum.

00:01:32.221 --> 00:01:37.955
But such a person has a complete vacuum.

00:01:40.288 --> 00:01:46.678
Vacuum of all the negative,

00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:53.548
aggressive qualities doesn't exist, complete.

00:02:00.142 --> 00:02:04.204
Such a person is eternal being.

00:02:04.424 --> 00:02:09.004
Nobody can kill,

00:02:09.205 --> 00:02:15.079
nobody can harm, nobody can hurt.

00:02:16.215 --> 00:02:22.050
The anger

00:02:22.251 --> 00:02:28.116
of anyone or respect of anyone does not touch such a person.

00:02:28.317 --> 00:02:32.245
He is not disturbed by insults or non-insults.

00:02:32.446 --> 00:02:44.338
He is not elated by praises

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:50.383
because he is devoid of the capacity to enjoy

00:02:50.584 --> 00:02:54.669
the boons of the ego.

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:12.836
So the third state where he reaches,

00:03:13.037 --> 00:03:18.741
he gets the blessing of the word ‘Nihi’ –

00:03:18.942 --> 00:03:20.827
Nihi.

00:03:23.675 --> 00:03:28.950
‘Nihi’ is the first word of My name.

00:03:29.151 --> 00:03:34.877
But in Sanskrit, when you combine it with, ‘Mala’,

00:03:35.078 --> 00:03:38.765
then it becomes 'Nirmala’.

00:03:39.694 --> 00:03:42.374
But the word is 'Nihi'.

00:03:42.575 --> 00:03:46.129
‘Ni’ which shakes little.

00:03:49.057 --> 00:03:51.247
‘nih’ -

00:03:51.448 --> 00:03:57.567
that means

00:03:57.768 --> 00:04:00.424
‘sheer’.

00:04:04.494 --> 00:04:12.134
Or when a ‘i’ is added to it.

00:04:15.245 --> 00:04:21.839
But the first ‘nihi’ means without - devoid

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:29.274
and ‘Nira’ means sheer.

00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:42.475
Like when you say

00:04:42.676 --> 00:04:50.516
‘nirananda’, ‘niratma’ - sheer ‘atma’,

00:04:50.717 --> 00:04:53.131
sheer joy. ‘Kevelam’ -

00:04:53.332 --> 00:04:58.621
the only, there’s nothing but joy.

00:05:01.377 --> 00:05:05.447
But this word is used,

00:05:05.648 --> 00:05:08.790
‘nira’ or ‘nihi’,

00:05:08.991 --> 00:05:17.759
used in two forms as I told you. One for say,

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.921
without or devoid of.

00:05:24.122 --> 00:05:29.631
The another form is:

00:05:29.832 --> 00:05:33.277
the only - absolute;

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.104
the absolute.

00:05:40.628 --> 00:05:45.937
So here the joy becomes ‘nirananda’, absolute joy,

00:05:46.138 --> 00:05:48.806
nothing but joy.

00:05:49.007 --> 00:05:51.983
It's complete freedom.

00:05:52.405 --> 00:05:56.320
So you have all kinds of joys,

00:05:56.521 --> 00:06:02.749
as I told you before, you have ‘Swanand’-

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:06.770
the joy of the Spirit.

00:06:08.223 --> 00:06:14.941
Then you have got ‘Brahmananda’ - the joy of well-being.

00:06:16.185 --> 00:06:19.173
You've got ‘Leelananda’, ‘Krishnananda’-

00:06:19.374 --> 00:06:24.147
where you have the joy of the play.

00:06:27.882 --> 00:06:31.374
But when you reach the state of Sahasrara

00:06:31.575 --> 00:06:34.247
it is ‘Nirananda’ -

00:06:34.448 --> 00:06:38.479
means, sheer absolute joy.

00:06:40.116 --> 00:06:43.894
Though the name ‘Nira’ is My name,

00:06:44.095 --> 00:06:47.373
it means absolute.

00:06:48.102 --> 00:06:50.555
So when you put such an adjective before

00:06:50.756 --> 00:06:54.446
anything else it becomes absolute.

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:09.549
Thus you become absolute.

00:07:12.737 --> 00:07:18.466
And when you are at that state of absolute

00:07:18.667 --> 00:07:24.877
then there is no place for anything else to be there but yourself.

00:07:31.519 --> 00:07:35.550
But let us see what is absolute.

00:07:40.975 --> 00:07:45.055
That means it is not relative;

00:07:45.256 --> 00:07:47.610
it has no relative qualities.

00:07:47.811 --> 00:07:52.961
Absolute cannot be compared, ‘atulaniya’ -

00:07:53.162 --> 00:07:55.872
it cannot be compared.

00:07:57.062 --> 00:08:01.726
It cannot be related to anything, it is absolute.

00:08:04.856 --> 00:08:08.354
It cannot be comprehended because it cannot be related to

00:08:08.555 --> 00:08:12.089
anything else through which we can comprehend;

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:14.969
it is absolute.

00:08:19.282 --> 00:08:25.206
Whatever way you try to know it

00:08:25.407 --> 00:08:29.617
you go away from absolute.

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:40.525
Wherever you try to analyze the absolute you are away from it.

00:08:50.807 --> 00:08:56.256
So this is what at Sahasrara you get – ‘Niranand’.

00:08:58.312 --> 00:09:01.818
In different stages of Sahaja Yoga

00:09:02.019 --> 00:09:06.157
we had to start from ‘shariranand’,

00:09:06.358 --> 00:09:10.811
means the anand of the body,

00:09:12.202 --> 00:09:19.506
‘manasanand’ - the joy of the ‘manasa’- is the psyche.

00:09:23.556 --> 00:09:26.336
Then you can say ‘ahamkaranand’,

00:09:26.537 --> 00:09:30.927
where you have to have the satisfaction of the ego.

00:09:32.865 --> 00:09:36.279
But the state has now

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:40.466
to be established within us is of Niranand.

00:09:41.739 --> 00:09:46.192
Then what is the question of fear?

00:09:48.966 --> 00:09:51.884
What is the question of talking about it?

00:09:52.085 --> 00:09:56.969
You cannot talk, because
how will you relate it?

00:09:57.170 --> 00:10:01.654
I cannot say, “It is like this, it is like that”.

00:10:03.294 --> 00:10:06.385
There are no words for absolute to describe.

00:10:06.586 --> 00:10:09.205
Only by negation, ‘not this, not this, not this’,

00:10:09.406 --> 00:10:12.773
what remains is absolute.

00:10:16.194 --> 00:10:20.561
So you reach the state of absolute.

00:10:23.647 --> 00:10:26.092
And that is the state

00:10:26.293 --> 00:10:31.250
a complete communication is established

00:10:31.451 --> 00:10:36.187
and in that communication you have nobody else

00:10:36.388 --> 00:10:39.661
but the absolute within you.

00:10:46.429 --> 00:10:50.475
That is the Sahasrar Puja you are here for.

00:10:51.342 --> 00:10:55.849
That is the level to which you should aspire.

00:10:57.359 --> 00:11:02.626
That should be the ascent,

00:11:02.827 --> 00:11:07.358
which should be established within ourselves.

00:11:08.475 --> 00:11:10.909
We don't have to go to Himalayas,

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:14.528
we don't have to do anything drastic.

00:11:14.729 --> 00:11:20.190
Remaining in this world we have to become the absolute -

00:11:20.391 --> 00:11:24.312
the only, ‘kevalam’.

00:11:29.113 --> 00:11:34.402
There is nothing like ‘how?’ for it, you just become.

00:11:36.665 --> 00:11:43.563
You just become, like a flowers becomes a fruit.

00:11:43.764 --> 00:11:49.756
It's all built in, within you. Allow it to work out.

00:11:50.369 --> 00:11:55.095
Just by surrendering you become.

00:11:56.657 --> 00:12:00.597
Surrender it and you'll be surprised

00:12:00.798 --> 00:12:07.962
you will be at the state where you will enjoy your absoluteness.

00:12:09.243 --> 00:12:12.652
It is absolute love,

00:12:12.853 --> 00:12:16.353
it is absolute compassion;

00:12:16.554 --> 00:12:20.384
it is absolute power.

00:12:33.502 --> 00:12:35.808
The words stop,

00:12:36.009 --> 00:12:40.384
the description stops;

00:12:42.322 --> 00:12:45.372
you just become the absolute

00:12:45.573 --> 00:12:52.419
and feel your absoluteness through it

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:56.010
with that oneness.

00:12:57.909 --> 00:13:02.916
If somebody is not with you, you don't worry.

00:13:04.542 --> 00:13:07.685
There’s no company needed.

00:13:07.886 --> 00:13:14.089
You're alone, enjoying the absolute.

00:13:20.017 --> 00:13:26.561
There only you can enjoy the absolute in others also,

00:13:26.762 --> 00:13:33.097
in the best form without seeing anything else but the absolute.

00:13:38.395 --> 00:13:40.840
May God bless you.
