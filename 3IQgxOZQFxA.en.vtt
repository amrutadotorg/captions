00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:08.629
[UNCLEAR] started feeling out
something working

00:00:08.714 --> 00:00:16.332
And from somewhere three very hefty
people, came in absolutely black in color

00:00:16.374 --> 00:00:22.154
very hefty and tall, [UNCLEAR] and they
caught hold of them and they beat them

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.290
but they never got hurt as such and brought
them on the street and [UNCLEAR]

00:00:27.376 --> 00:00:33.466
"Go back and never come to this side."So
they kept the [UNCLEAR] alright

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.310
[UNCLEAR - BHAAG?] and said, "What kind of
a kadak devta you have?"

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:44.234
Kadak means, a very strong; "Who is this Kadak
devta you worship that they beat us like this?"

00:00:44.482 --> 00:00:47.982
So, what has happened you're so...

00:00:49.761 --> 00:00:52.571
- My own case [UNCLEAR], I'll say
- Hmm?

00:00:52.623 --> 00:00:54.543
- Actually, my own case
- Hmm

00:00:54.543 --> 00:00:59.856
- [UNCLEAR]
- Hmm?

00:01:00.441 --> 00:01:06.793
I was being attacked by a good [UNCLEAR]
and they had - wanted to kill me

00:01:06.897 --> 00:01:13.147
and they came with sword to cut my head
in two but instead of getting my head

00:01:13.518 --> 00:01:19.668
all my arteries here, they just got my ear.
Twice he tried; Each time just barely [UNCLEAR]

00:01:20.176 --> 00:01:25.976
Then at that point I prayed, I said, "If
this is the time to go, then I'm prepared

00:01:26.062 --> 00:01:30.872
but, You know, I leave my spirit into Your
hands," and at that moment everything

00:01:30.872 --> 00:01:35.118
became very bright, I don't know how and
although they were fifteen or sixteen people,

00:01:35.132 --> 00:01:37.512
they could not hold my hands,
they didn't have the strength;

00:01:37.512 --> 00:01:40.702
and all of them, just walked
away from - they could not

00:01:42.558 --> 00:01:45.418
And then, two hundred little boys
came from some school there

00:01:45.454 --> 00:01:48.434
- That's right, two hundred children
- and they caught hold of him and took

00:01:48.434 --> 00:01:54.544
him to the hospital and in the hospital
he had some body surgeons, who knew -

00:01:54.544 --> 00:01:59.554
- but just was passing that way.
- This is what happened with them

00:01:59.554 --> 00:02:03.554
two hundred children came, they took me to
the dispensary and then [UNCLEAR] sleep

00:02:03.561 --> 00:02:07.571
in the afternoon, so they knocked on the door
and four people came out and they said,

00:02:07.571 --> 00:02:11.846
"Shall we get an ambulance?" At that moment,
another doctor whom I knew, was passing by

00:02:11.876 --> 00:02:16.566
he saw the crowd, came, he saw me, took me
into his car, took me to the hospital

00:02:16.566 --> 00:02:21.005
but that was lunch time, so all the surgeons
should have been at home but by chance,

00:02:21.005 --> 00:02:26.250
- every surgeon in the hospital was there.
- and he carried his ear, like this and put it

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.633
diagonal. He's a doctor [UNCLEAR] 
and he sensed it.

00:02:30.633 --> 00:02:33.988
It was completely cut off, there was
no blood vessels, nothing. It was just

00:02:33.988 --> 00:02:36.793
- In India, you were where?
- In Calcutta.

00:02:36.793 --> 00:02:39.967
Yes, in Jamshedpur. Yeah, I met
Shri Mataji here.

00:02:39.971 --> 00:02:42.521
- And then you were [UNCLEAR]
- Yes

00:02:43.065 --> 00:02:45.225
- You're Gujratis, are you?
- Yes

00:02:45.225 --> 00:02:49.055
- And he's also Gujrati?
- We both have [UNCLEAR] Kshatriya

00:02:49.055 --> 00:02:50.995
- Annh? 
- [UNCLEAR] Kshatriya

00:02:50.995 --> 00:02:53.821
- So, what is your Sir name?
- Thakur

00:02:53.842 --> 00:02:59.492
- Thakur... haan.. Kshatriyas are very
good for sahaja yog. They do very well.

00:03:04.463 --> 00:03:11.343
- So, you came from West Africa or from
- Nahin. I'm from Ahmadabad and he's from Baroda

00:03:11.343 --> 00:03:14.738
- Achcha!
- Can you speak Maharashtra?

00:03:14.738 --> 00:03:24.238
- Achcha!
- Jogian and boys they colony mein, they say, Shrivastava, Shrivastava

00:03:24.238 --> 00:03:29.737
- and we were talking we say, Shrivastav
- Shrivastav is correct.

00:03:30.861 --> 00:03:34.611
- Shrivastav is correct..... Shrivastav

00:03:35.184 --> 00:03:39.514
[UNCLEAR] has learnt his Hanuman Chalisa
and asked me to type in English

00:03:39.514 --> 00:03:41.814
- Hunh....
- Translations

00:03:42.377 --> 00:03:45.347
- But My husband is from UP
- I see.

00:03:45.347 --> 00:03:49.472
But Baroda, we had very good center there.
You see, they could not continue with it

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.490
because the gentleman was Veeraji - 
you must have heard his name.

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.587
- I not know about anyone else.
- Oh, I see

00:03:55.587 --> 00:04:00.085
- I'm not friendly
- He started, you see, that thing and

00:04:00.153 --> 00:04:05.252
then he's now very sick - sick in the sense,
he's very old. His wife is also very old

00:04:05.252 --> 00:04:10.649
so, somehow, it's not so working out
but now, Raol Bai has gone there

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:13.839
another sahaja yogini, who's very
powerful. She's gone there so,

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:19.351
she'll start again, I think, in Baroda.
Ahmadabad also, we had this..... Shodhan

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.860
- Shodhan, haan
- Shodhan bhai. He did a lot for us

00:04:24.119 --> 00:04:27.569
but Ahmadabad, you see, people are
very materialistic, I think,

00:04:27.596 --> 00:04:29.906
- Very materialistic!
- Extremely materialistic and

00:04:29.906 --> 00:04:34.076
they were just bothered about
sickness or money problems

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:36.789
- money-minded
- Extremely money-minded and very
much worried

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:41.093
about money this... everybody came to
say Sarabhai, this, that because all had

00:04:41.093 --> 00:04:44.557
these problems; I got fed up, I said,
"I'll not do now,"

00:04:44.557 --> 00:04:48.465
you see, because you must have spiritual
hankering, isn't it - otherwise it is such

00:04:48.475 --> 00:04:53.561
a waste of time - these people. They'll come
later on; Let us first settle down with

00:04:53.581 --> 00:04:59.534
sahaja yogis, who are good and who are
spiritually endowed, who are spiritually strong.

00:04:59.572 --> 00:05:06.248
Then gradually, these people will come.
Now we have a television program

00:05:06.716 --> 00:05:12.266
and what I hear is that, thousands of people
have it. If I didn't have sahaja yogis,

00:05:12.682 --> 00:05:17.762
it's impossible. You know, every program
I had 400-500 people and curing them

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:22.759
doing this but even sitting down, on the
pulpit, people were getting cured.

00:05:24.536 --> 00:05:29.236
Just sitting down there - that's one way
you cure but still, you have to attend to them

00:05:29.241 --> 00:05:34.801
you have to tell them. You need sahaja yogis
first, then you can attend to the masses - isn't it?

00:05:41.616 --> 00:05:48.224
But I think, with money- mindedness in
Ahmadabad, they follow others.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.750
If one start, and he's strong enough
sahaja yogi, then they will follow

00:05:52.964 --> 00:05:58.294
- but one has to be strongly through.
- Hmm, no we had Shodhan bhai but Shodhan bhai

00:05:58.294 --> 00:06:03.680
got lost because he got very sick; He also
became very old. See, but his wife and all

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:10.349
that are going through quite a lot and the
problem is, when people are money-minded,

00:06:10.388 --> 00:06:17.558
you see, they get enamored by other gurus, who
take money - they sort of vie to see things

00:06:18.153 --> 00:06:23.313
which as if could solve their money 
problems. Like, they will go and ask anyone

00:06:23.417 --> 00:06:29.107
the number of the horse, you see, sort of thing;
They like such horrible gurus and pay them

00:06:29.769 --> 00:06:35.119
and such people prosper. Ahmadabad
has got lots of gurus - horrible it is!

00:06:35.147 --> 00:06:39.317
- We were there until boys came
- Really?

00:06:41.157 --> 00:06:45.367
- So many horrible gurus!
- Till that night in my house we had first

00:06:47.884 --> 00:06:56.990
one group and that night they went to the
hills here and throw everything in the streets

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:59.000
- everything
- Hmm

00:06:59.167 --> 00:07:04.157
so that's how we are saved or we are
here today in one piece

00:07:04.194 --> 00:07:06.064
- He was Mahishasura
- Who?

00:07:06.214 --> 00:07:11.174
- Mahishasura.
- Mahishasura - Wow! he's the worst of all.

00:07:11.227 --> 00:07:15.167
- The worst is, he gives heart attack.
- Troubles

00:07:15.582 --> 00:07:18.882
- So much of falsehood!
- He suffered so much.

00:07:18.882 --> 00:07:21.173
- How?
- Except for his health and

00:07:21.173 --> 00:07:25.883
The husband always gets it. I've seen, if the
wife is that, husband always gets it invariably

00:07:25.883 --> 00:07:32.333
My own brother, my own brother but the
day I told him, he threw away everything.

00:07:32.425 --> 00:07:37.835
That night, that day, I don't know, it
just came over. This little fellow and

00:07:38.097 --> 00:07:44.747
Paul and Shailesh and Allan everything black
dustbin bag and threw everything that night.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.588
You, you see, we must think, we don't 
want diamonds, we don't want these,

00:07:50.588 --> 00:07:54.736
only God, you see. So, this fellow is
giving diamonds, this, that and all that.

00:07:54.749 --> 00:08:01.729
Yeah, if you are, sort of, near, you get this, if you
are, you get saris, if you are, then get diamond ring

00:08:01.807 --> 00:08:04.057
- Only to the rich
- Yes

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:08.880
Only to the rich. For example, My brother,
they gave him a ring.

00:08:09.695 --> 00:08:12.225
So, I told him, "How many you have
diamond rings?"

00:08:12.229 --> 00:08:15.039
He said, "I don't know how many
I have. I never wear them."

00:08:15.039 --> 00:08:18.413
- So I said, "Why did you take this?"
- He said, "Because he said it is my blessing."

00:08:18.413 --> 00:08:23.694
I said, "But why does he give you a diamond? If he
has to give it, give it to somebody who doesn't have.

00:08:23.694 --> 00:08:27.534
For example, your driver, if he uses this
diamond ring, it has some value."

00:08:27.935 --> 00:08:31.522
But then you know, we discovered that My
sister-in-law was giving

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.570
unconsciously all her diamonds to him.

00:08:37.683 --> 00:08:42.813
I believe it, I [UNCLEAR] believe
it - property, money

00:08:43.224 --> 00:08:47.654
Say, she was just passing on to him without
knowing that she's doing it , you see.

00:08:47.688 --> 00:08:52.669
Because they were having, they just found out that
they have lost lot of diamonds from the household

00:08:52.669 --> 00:08:57.549
and, then she said, "Yes, I give him, I think.
I gave him this time that thing."

00:08:57.549 --> 00:09:01.781
So, I asked her, "Why did you give?"; She's
a doctor. I said, "Why did you give?"

00:09:01.781 --> 00:09:05.431
He said, she said, "You see, somebody tells
me all the time these are stones

00:09:05.431 --> 00:09:11.701
why do you want to have bhoot badha?" I said,
"If he is a sanyasi, then, if these are stones to you,

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:16.210
it should be dust to him. Why should he
take it? Why should he take all these?"

00:09:16.214 --> 00:09:21.434
It's all right as you are managing them and
my brother is respectable man, whatever it is

00:09:21.434 --> 00:09:25.524
he has money and all that, as his wife, as
Grihalaxmi, you have to wear this - you are [UNCLEAR]

00:09:25.538 --> 00:09:31.518
why for the sanyasi baba? And to take somebody
else's diamonds, what is this I think?

00:09:34.186 --> 00:09:36.176
And they have amassed, you know, amassed

00:09:36.218 --> 00:09:38.788
If you read about this Ganesh
Yogi - recently I read -

00:09:38.788 --> 00:09:46.967
he has collected four thousand crores of
rupees - crores - four thousand crores.

00:09:47.014 --> 00:09:53.164
Yeah, I have seen in front of my eyes that
if you give this much, then you get into,

00:09:53.164 --> 00:10:00.590
you see them like that. The lady, poor
lady, who had a epileptic fit there,

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:07.332
really she was sick and he sitting down and
the woman volunteer, whatever they were,

00:10:07.332 --> 00:10:14.037
they gave a slip to her, "Sit properly, sit
properly," and then baba walked like that

00:10:14.037 --> 00:10:18.407
and that way he got sudden fit
and fell, You know he said

00:10:18.407 --> 00:10:22.671
"Why all this? Why do you allow these people
to come in here? Get out. Take them out.

00:10:22.671 --> 00:10:28.668
Get out of my ashram," like that.
[UNCLEAR] human. Like the [UNCLEAR]

00:10:28.668 --> 00:10:35.441
Sometimes even you see these people give them
to threat, if they want to get rid of someone,

00:10:35.441 --> 00:10:38.599
they can just give that face to people,
if they want.

00:10:44.383 --> 00:10:46.813
Only thing they're ready to handle

00:10:53.418 --> 00:10:58.338
There's no meditation, nothing, you see,
they don't talk of God or anything - nothing,

00:10:58.351 --> 00:11:07.437
- Just nothing. I mean, it is, I don't know.
- We had to meet Mahatma in Saudi Arabia that night

00:11:07.807 --> 00:11:13.477
and Thalin and I don't know what came 
after 6000 miles distance on the telephone,

00:11:13.722 --> 00:11:16.962
- he threw away everything
- [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

00:11:16.962 --> 00:11:22.335
- on the telephone [UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]
- He's a thakur na

00:11:22.335 --> 00:11:28.880
- So they say ki thakur ki ek baar khopdi 
kharaab ho jaaye to [UNCLEAR]
- Thakur can take talwar

00:11:28.963 --> 00:11:35.482
You see Thakur - Thakur is a caste, I 
mean, it's a caste of great brave men,

00:11:35.782 --> 00:11:42.783
so, once a, they say, once a rich man in 
Lucknow, employed one Thakur,

00:11:42.783 --> 00:11:46.059
you see, to protect him - very healthy man - and

00:11:46.063 --> 00:11:53.334
they were passing through some jungles and
some dacoits invaded - sort of attacked -

00:11:53.334 --> 00:12:00.684
and so he had about ten people who were
carrying everything, you know that he fought

00:12:00.688 --> 00:12:07.088
all the ten people, bit them and did all
kinds of everything, hit them and all that

00:12:08.187 --> 00:12:15.259
and after the ten were absolutely thrown on
the grounds, then this fellow, you see, thakur,

00:12:15.259 --> 00:12:20.970
raised his mustaches and hit all of
them and threw them away.

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:28.264
So when they came back, the gentleman who
was his master, gave him lots of property

00:12:28.264 --> 00:12:32.862
and gave him and said, "I'm thankful to you. You
saved my life and saved all of this and all that

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:38.430
but now, I cannot give him more employment,"
so they asked him, "Why not?"

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:44.571
He said, "Where will I get again ten
people to excite him?" [LAUGHTER]

00:12:44.571 --> 00:12:49.902
Ten people first have to die to excite him
or to fall down on the ground then the

00:12:49.924 --> 00:12:54.364
we were humiliate otherwise he's
very quiet. [LAUGHTER]

00:12:56.673 --> 00:13:01.573
Even in Maharashtra these Marathas are
the ones, who are really active -

00:13:01.573 --> 00:13:05.365
Dhumaal is a Marathi - most of them are
Marathas. [UNCLEAR] is a Maratha

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.600
- Mainly Kshatriyas do sahaja yog.
- Hmm

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.766
- [UNCLEAR] the Brahmins
- Kshatriyas are the best, you see.

00:13:09.766 --> 00:13:15.103
And this Dhumaal is old in sahaj yoga
- very, very premature he is

00:13:18.369 --> 00:13:24.229
But they say [UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:13:24.241 --> 00:13:28.191
Brahmins also because, you see, they
had so many ritualism with them.

00:13:28.191 --> 00:13:32.428
Marathas because they are brave and
courageous, they come and settle.

00:13:33.098 --> 00:13:36.654
Also, I think that mostly Kshatriyas
worshipped the Devi

00:13:36.676 --> 00:13:39.906
- Haan, of course, Shakti pujari - yes
- [UNCLEAR] that is the most

00:13:39.922 --> 00:13:43.892
And you now see, I.P. Singh is a Kshatriya
and Nagendra Singh is a Kshatriya -

00:13:43.892 --> 00:13:48.825
- see all of them are like that.
- They are on the stem, the value of the Devi

00:13:48.825 --> 00:13:51.690
- Kshatriyas
- are Kshatriyas.

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:56.174
People of [UNCLEAR CONVERSATION] Devi ko bahut maante hain

00:13:56.801 --> 00:14:03.821
Put your hand. [UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:14:10.004 --> 00:14:14.004
- This little Gibbs is coming, I gather, there.
- [UNCLEAR]

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:19.270
and she finds very difficult because
of the ...

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:27.220
You all put your left hand towards Me,
right hand outside - right hand outside

00:14:28.237 --> 00:14:31.897
and watch Me. Put both the feet on
the ground, straight.

00:14:43.649 --> 00:14:52.511
Have you worked out anything about the
diseases you want to tackle? [UNCLEAR] Gavin?

00:14:52.716 --> 00:14:54.696
- Lots of them Shri Mataji.
- Annh?

00:14:54.696 --> 00:14:58.696
- They're quite a few
- Quite a few - and you've done the list.

00:14:59.612 --> 00:15:03.122
- Tell the ones that have been requested.
- Tomorrow I'll be absolutely free the whole day

00:15:03.122 --> 00:15:07.217
- Yes, Shri Mataji.
- Do you think tomorrow the whole day I should
give it to you?

00:15:07.217 --> 00:15:10.948
- I'm absolutely free because CP's out.
- Sure, Shri Mataji!

00:15:10.948 --> 00:15:14.099
- Annh?
- Thank You. Yeah.

00:15:14.099 --> 00:15:18.317
But we have to do something about it, you
see, because now we have to face so many

00:15:18.433 --> 00:15:24.733
Better? How is it? Come here. Come here,
just come. Take out your coat.

00:15:25.796 --> 00:15:30.096
One bigsome disease is Shri Mataji, is
all these mental illnessnesses.

00:15:30.147 --> 00:15:33.467
Na, na left side attack [UNCLEAR] 
now turn around.

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:37.130
- They're big problem.
- Now left side - you see now. Put it, go further.

00:15:37.261 --> 00:15:42.701
For that all the left sided problems should be solved with a candle or light or fire.

00:15:42.996 --> 00:15:48.726
Anything that is light, see, is against them
- fire on the left side

00:15:48.726 --> 00:15:52.775
Now this one also has a left side problem.
So, what do you have to do

00:15:52.775 --> 00:15:56.191
- is to raise his right.
- Left

00:15:57.942 --> 00:16:03.682
Now see, you raise his right. Be careful
about the - also watch the flame -

00:16:03.682 --> 00:16:10.386
flame will indicate to you.
Now put it to the left

00:16:18.251 --> 00:16:21.171
Left Swadhishthana

00:16:33.789 --> 00:16:39.449
Really, it is coming out - feel it. All 
the pressure on the void is released.

00:16:52.275 --> 00:16:57.375
- Hunh
- and the heart [UNCLEAR]

00:16:57.667 --> 00:17:01.417
That's the Jagdamba place because he's
[UNCLEAR] chaturya, you see.

00:17:01.423 --> 00:17:06.023
Now, for him now, what is the first
problem, is the void.

00:17:06.166 --> 00:17:10.216
Void problem is there because he had a
wrong guru, you see.

00:17:10.377 --> 00:17:16.207
Because it is on the left hand side, he should
put his right hand towards the left hand side.

00:17:16.207 --> 00:17:19.594
- Put his right hand towards the left hand side.
- Hmm

00:17:22.175 --> 00:17:27.165
I saw some photographs, Shri Mataji, of this
Mahishasur, where he puts his photograph

00:17:27.165 --> 00:17:31.914
- inside the Lingam of Lord Shiva.
- Hmm, so?

00:17:31.914 --> 00:17:33.467
- Mahishasur
- Oh!

00:17:33.467 --> 00:17:38.521
There's a photograph where there's a Lingam, of 
Shiva's Lingam and he put his photograph inside it

00:17:38.521 --> 00:17:42.837
That's how he reached the heart. Now put,
no, I'm saying, now put your

00:17:43.004 --> 00:17:47.474
- this is your left hand - this side - that's
your right hand - alright?

00:17:51.136 --> 00:17:57.644
This Lingam is given by Mahishasur to
his father and he worships it everyday

00:17:57.669 --> 00:18:01.879
- Baap re!
- from 3 0'clock in the morning till 10 at night

00:18:01.879 --> 00:18:10.802
- [UNCLEAR] in the house.
- Ab Rustom dekho? Ab inka shuru - behavior very aggressive

00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:18.150
- Joy comes up to Vishuddhi petal but Vishuddhi
- But Vishuddhi is blocked very much.

00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:21.880
- Right?
- Center, Mother. Center is blocked very much

00:18:21.982 --> 00:18:28.804
- Sushumna is blocked just below the Vishuddhi
- He never said Vishuddhi. He has said mantra?

00:18:28.804 --> 00:18:34.993
- Hmm, already it's clearing
- Hmm, the whole thing heart now - right heart

00:18:34.993 --> 00:18:38.327
But basically - you see this one - 
now where did you put your? Haan

00:18:38.327 --> 00:18:42.867
- Now you say, "Mother, I am my own guru."
- Mother, I am my own guru.

00:18:42.867 --> 00:18:45.264
- Again
- Mother, I am my own guru

00:18:45.288 --> 00:18:47.488
- Again
- Mother, I am my own guru

00:18:47.488 --> 00:18:49.978
- Again
- Mother, I am my own guru

00:18:49.978 --> 00:18:52.408
- Again
- Mother, I am my own guru

00:18:52.408 --> 00:18:54.590
- Again
- Mother, I am my own guru

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:56.650
- Again
- Mother, I am my own guru

00:18:56.965 --> 00:18:59.494
- Again
- Mother, I am my own guru

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:04.030
- Unh, 
- Much better

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:06.330
- what - cleared out
- Even Vishuddhi blocked

00:19:06.439 --> 00:19:10.699
Now see - [HINDI - aap aage aakar ke inki
theek se] - He's with Mahishasura also,

00:19:10.709 --> 00:19:16.079
the main thing is, the heart is
catching - center heart. Now, who do you pray?

00:19:16.079 --> 00:19:21.012
You should say, "Jagdamba, Jagdamba,
Jagdamba - Saakshat Jagdamba, Aham 
Saakshat Jagdamba,

00:19:21.124 --> 00:19:24.864
Saakshat Jagdamba, Aham Saakshat Jagdamba,
Aham Saakshat Jagdamba,

00:19:24.864 --> 00:19:28.735
Aham Saakshat Jagdamba, Aham Saakshat Jagdamba
Aham Saakshat Jagdamba."

00:19:28.735 --> 00:19:30.415
- Much better.
- Yeah

00:19:30.415 --> 00:19:34.635
Now, hold the Vishuddhi. Now it will be 
more Left Vishuddhi because of his mantra

00:19:35.739 --> 00:19:38.889
So, "Aham Saakshat Sarvamantrasiddhi,
Aham Saakshat Sarvamantrasiddhi,

00:19:38.889 --> 00:19:42.945
Aham Saakshat Sarvamantrasiddhi, Aham
Saakshat Sarvamantrasiddhi,

00:19:42.945 --> 00:19:46.875
Aham Saakshat Vishnumaya, Aham Saakshat
Vishnumaya, Aham Saakshat Vishnumaya,

00:19:46.875 --> 00:19:50.212
Saakshat Vishnumaya, Aham Saakshat
Vishnumaya, Aham Saakshat Vishnumaya,

00:19:50.212 --> 00:19:54.752
Saakshat Vishnumaya, Aham Saakshat
Vishnumaya. Aane laga. Now, what is it?

00:19:54.752 --> 00:20:00.333
Eight times Vishnumaya and eight times
Mantra Siddhi will work out.

00:20:02.363 --> 00:20:09.053
Alright? Better now? Much better. Now,
Agnya - left Agnya will be always there -

00:20:09.651 --> 00:20:14.581
Aham Saakshat MahaGanesha, Maha Bhairava,
Aham Saakshat MahaGanesha, Maha Bhairava

00:20:14.581 --> 00:20:17.832
Aham Saakshat Mahaganesha, Maha
Bhairava, Saakshat MahaGanesha.

00:20:17.832 --> 00:20:22.105
Here you'll find people getting blind, you
see. When they are blind just ask them

00:20:22.105 --> 00:20:26.552
to put one light in front and one light 
at the back - just give it a bandhan -

00:20:26.552 --> 00:20:31.262
Saakshat MahaGanesha, Maha Bhairava, Aham
Saakshat MahaGanesha, Maha Bhairava -

00:20:31.262 --> 00:20:39.218
At this point even you can say - "Aham Saakshat
Mahishasur Mardini, Aham Saakshat Mahisha,"

00:20:39.218 --> 00:20:44.267
At the Sahastrara you can say, "Saakshat
Mahishasur Mardini, Aham Saakshat
Mahishasur Mardini,

00:20:44.277 --> 00:20:47.777
Saakshat Mahishasur Mardini,
Aham Saakshat Mahishasur Mardini,

00:20:47.787 --> 00:20:51.449
Aham Saakshat Mahishasur Mardini,
Aham Saakshat Mahishasur Mardini,

00:20:51.449 --> 00:20:56.412
Aham Saakshat Mahishasur Mardini,
Aham Saakshat, anh - it's there!

00:20:56.563 --> 00:21:01.413
Aham Saakshat Moksh Dayini, Aham Saakshat
Moksh Dayini, Aham Saakshat Moksh Dayini,

00:21:01.413 --> 00:21:05.134
Saakshat Moksh Dayini, Aham Saakshat
Moksh Dayini, Aham Saakshat Moksh Dayini,

00:21:05.134 --> 00:21:11.405
Aham Saakshat Moksh Dayini - alright?
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:11.432 --> 00:21:16.432
- There! [UNCLEAR]
- Very easy Kundalini [UNCLEAR] Mother

00:21:16.432 --> 00:21:22.226
Very simple! Because you are realized souls
now - all the mantras are jagrut in you -

00:21:22.226 --> 00:21:26.304
everything is jagrut; Whatever you say,
is the Truth with [UNCLEAR - OTHER?] meaning.

00:21:26.304 --> 00:21:29.333
- See, it's cleared out now.
- Put yourself into bandhan, that's all.

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:34.030
Now don't feel guilty; That's one thing
you people don't do - is to feel guilty.

00:21:34.057 --> 00:21:37.727
You are facing Me; What is there
to feel guilty?

00:21:38.262 --> 00:21:40.072
- Now let's ....
- He's a very ....

00:21:40.072 --> 00:21:44.360
- Alright, sit down.
- He's suffered, he had suffered from asthma

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:48.482
- and very bad chest trouble.
- That's because of his father

00:21:48.899 --> 00:21:53.789
Now, hold your breath. Now, asthma -
hold your breath.

00:21:53.796 --> 00:21:58.826
Saakshat Jagdamba, Aham Saakshat Jagdamba,
Aham Saakshat Jagdamba, Aham Saakshat Jagdamba

00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:02.500
Aham Saakshat Jagdamba, Aham Saakshat
Jagdamba, Saakshat Jagdamba,

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:07.115
Aham Saakshat Jagdamba, Saakshat Jagdamba
- Haan, done. Now, hold your ...

00:22:07.115 --> 00:22:13.889
now, for asthma best thing is, to put 
bracket Jagdamba and Shri Rama together

00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:19.100
Aham Saakshat Shri Ram Jagdamba,
Aham Saakshat Shri Ram Jagdamba,

00:22:19.323 --> 00:22:24.393
Shri Ram Jagdamba, Aham Saakshat - 
now you can just say, Nirmal, Nirmal Shri

00:22:24.742 --> 00:22:29.722
Aham Saakshat Nirmal Ram, Aham Saakshat
Nirmal Ram, Aham Saakshat Nirmal Ram,

00:22:29.722 --> 00:22:34.581
Aham Saakshat - cleaned out -
are you alright?

00:22:34.581 --> 00:22:39.253
- Breathing is alright now?
- Yes, Mother.

00:22:39.317 --> 00:22:43.328
Just a, just a weak mind - I'll say, say sit 
down, sit down that facing that side.

00:22:43.333 --> 00:22:46.113
He's gone out na - little
bit. He's not feeling it but it's here.

00:22:46.113 --> 00:22:47.817
- Haan
- Haan, that's it.

00:22:47.834 --> 00:22:52.234
Now - Aham Saakshat Nirmal MahaGanesha,
Aham Saakshat Nirmal MahaGanesha

00:22:52.234 --> 00:22:55.936
Aham Saakshat Nirmal MahaGanesha,
Saakshat Nirmal MahaGanesha

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:59.770
Aham Saakshat Nirmal MahaGanesha,
Aham Saakshat Nirmal MahaGanesha,

00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:02.858
Aham Saakshat Nirmal MahaGanesha,
Aham Saakshat Nirmal MahaGanesha

00:23:02.858 --> 00:23:05.598
Aham Saakshat - done.

00:23:05.598 --> 00:23:09.724
Now you can say, "Aham Saakshat 
Mokshdayini, Aham Saakshat Mokshdayini,

00:23:09.728 --> 00:23:12.558
Aham Saakshat Mokshdayini,
Aham Saakshat Mokshdayini,

00:23:12.558 --> 00:23:16.248
Aham Saakshat Mokshdayini,
Aham Saakshat Mokshdayini,

00:23:16.248 --> 00:23:23.194
Aham Saakshat Mokshdayini." For Me,
even once, it's alright to say but you all

00:23:23.194 --> 00:23:25.748
- should say seven times - understand.
- This is the, actually where the both void are catching

00:23:25.748 --> 00:23:27.652
- Annh?
- [UNCLEAR] yeah

00:23:27.652 --> 00:23:31.481
- What's it?
- Both of them, they. It's all get's matching

00:23:31.481 --> 00:23:35.472
Coming from there, hain - so put it down.
That's the way, to Mahakali.

00:23:35.497 --> 00:23:41.947
This is Mahakali's mantra - Aham Saakshat
Mahakali, Aham Saakshat Mahakali,

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:48.840
- Aham Saakshat Mahakali
- Hunh, hunh

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:55.660
What you [UNCLEAR - CALL?]

00:24:04.394 --> 00:24:09.874
Arre Mahakali to idhar bhi aana chahiye - 
yeh thode na left main hi - left hai - sorry

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:15.140
Aham Saakshat Mahakali. [UNCLEAR] Inko
liver bhi hai. He has both the sides.

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:17.910
- Haan, that's true
- That's why

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:22.692
He's a staunch religious person from the
childhood and he has picked up all wrong gurus.

00:24:22.692 --> 00:24:29.446
- Who? [UNCLEAR] got the right heart
- So, it needs a clearing

00:24:29.446 --> 00:24:31.476
- I'll do it
- [UNCLEAR]

00:24:31.485 --> 00:24:36.325
- It breaks these candles.
- Yes, it's alright. It [UNCLEAR]
- Achcha.

00:24:39.087 --> 00:24:42.347
My nephew has just gone to W Inter School,
Mother.

00:24:42.372 --> 00:24:46.042
- Who?
- My nephew. He's at celebrity School.

00:24:46.042 --> 00:24:50.645
- Oh, Columbus, St. Columbus - is a boarder?
- Boarder

00:24:52.065 --> 00:24:56.575
- That's who's son?
- My cousin sister - the one who is a dentist,

00:24:56.575 --> 00:25:00.449
- who came on [UNCLEAR]
- Oh!

00:25:02.586 --> 00:25:07.756
Now, let's bring [UNCLEAR] this thing
down, alright. So, what we'll do is to -

00:25:07.771 --> 00:25:12.621
Aham Saakshat Mahakali, Aham Saakshat - 
you see because of My - I don't have to

00:25:12.621 --> 00:25:17.717
wait for My right, left or [UNCLEAR] -
Saakshat Mahakali

00:25:26.321 --> 00:25:29.331
Ab Swadhishthan pe jaake Mahakali

00:25:37.252 --> 00:25:43.412
- Left Swadhishthan, I think - that is all I feel
- Actually, he's got it from his father

00:25:43.415 --> 00:25:48.335
because his father has a heart, you see, so
he's indicating. If the father has a heart,

00:25:48.335 --> 00:25:53.615
the child gets this because the father's
side na, mother's side. Haan!

00:25:53.983 --> 00:25:56.873
Actually, it's his [UNCLEAR] as the
left Swadhishthana is sucking it

00:25:57.143 --> 00:26:00.360
- Hunh?
- The left Swadhishthana is sucking the problem all the while.

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:08.013
Isliye left Swadhishthan pe rakhna chahiye
Give it a bandhan aur keep thoda right - light.

00:26:09.053 --> 00:26:12.653
Keep it in such a way, even if you don't 
have, you can keep the photograph.

00:26:16.391 --> 00:26:19.331
- Coming out
- [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:25.278 --> 00:26:28.408
It's better to have it there than to have
it [UNCLEAR]

00:26:54.369 --> 00:27:00.023
- Chota hai shayad
- Isko down karne se Shri Mataji

00:27:00.023 --> 00:27:04.567
- Hain? Down kar [UNCLEAR] issiliye

00:27:09.211 --> 00:27:11.941
I think [UNCLEAR] to left

00:27:24.742 --> 00:27:28.932
So all the permutations and combinations
of left side it has tried.

00:27:29.276 --> 00:27:35.386
Agar left side ka simple; First of all, any
left side - right to the left. [UNCLEAR]

00:27:36.267 --> 00:27:42.627
Then you have to see if it is Swadhishthana
- work out the problem but Mooladhara

00:27:42.956 --> 00:27:50.146
combination is the worst of all like Multiple
Sclerosis in Mooladhara. The lady was sitting

00:27:50.435 --> 00:27:57.135
I just lit the candle and there was a
little gap between her chin -

00:27:57.135 --> 00:28:01.569
and she couldn't lift her legs, you see and I
gave a bandhan thrice to her Mooladhara -

00:28:01.596 --> 00:28:06.976
and she lifted her both the legs. Can you
imagine - she lifted her both the legs.

00:28:07.649 --> 00:28:16.599
- Multiple Sclerosis.
- Left is very subtle because it will shift around the body.

00:28:16.599 --> 00:28:20.926
No but easier because of this - fire 
is the best for this - fire pe bitha do -

00:28:20.926 --> 00:28:25.605
fire is the best. Fire pe aisa nikalta
ha bas poocho - haan

00:28:27.408 --> 00:28:30.598
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:28:41.546 --> 00:28:46.006
When I was working in this mental hospital,
they used to be very upset because I used to

00:28:46.006 --> 00:28:51.012
burn a diya in front of Your photograph. Three or
four times they tried to stop me doing that.

00:28:51.306 --> 00:28:59.986
That's the problem. [UNCLEAR] rose really a child.
Terren's child had some sort of a disease also

00:29:00.087 --> 00:29:06.017
because Terrence went there - naturally,
if Terrence moves as you and you see,

00:29:06.017 --> 00:29:09.492
she went with a hospital. They said, "You have
to put Mother's photograph and everything."

00:29:09.492 --> 00:29:14.636
They refused, the doctors refused the
photograph; This is so subtle, I mean. They said,

00:29:14.636 --> 00:29:20.042
"You see, it might be contaminated or this
and that and all that and see, I think,
you better and all that."

00:29:20.045 --> 00:29:22.485
- Which hospital? Breach Candy?
- Yes

00:29:22.485 --> 00:29:25.537
- Naturally
- Stupid!
- If they [UNCLEAR]

00:29:25.567 --> 00:29:29.036
But one nurse in that Breach
Candy, knows about Me

00:29:29.164 --> 00:29:36.684
and she sent so many patients to Me. Are
you alright now? How are you feeling?

00:29:37.059 --> 00:29:42.869
Light? Just see him. What is this
coming out of your head? In front

00:29:43.448 --> 00:29:50.258
- Nothing
- Is it?

00:29:50.385 --> 00:29:54.385
- Not coming in [UNCLEAR] not yet [UNCLEAR]
- Not coming truly.

00:29:57.143 --> 00:30:02.103
It's coming but this he had a tall region
of [UNCLEAR] like that [UNCLEAR]

00:30:06.266 --> 00:30:09.846
- What is that?
- Ekadasha
- Hmm

00:30:15.036 --> 00:30:24.186
- Hun, haan it's opening out
- It's opened

00:30:27.328 --> 00:30:29.348
Turn round this way.

00:30:37.443 --> 00:30:44.248
Better! But in his case the right
side is weak.

00:30:44.258 --> 00:30:47.548
He has liver also, his liver also.

00:30:47.607 --> 00:30:50.337
- Gujrati logon mein liver bahut hota hai.
- Hmm

00:30:50.401 --> 00:30:53.441
kyonki farsand, warsand bahut khate
hain na - yeh kam karna chahiye.

00:30:53.441 --> 00:30:55.861
- Oily
- Haan oily, bahut khana hota hai oily

00:30:55.912 --> 00:30:59.822
aur doosra yeh bhi baat hai apart
from oily, they think too much.

00:31:00.069 --> 00:31:05.569
Even the women, I've seen, they think
they can plan - aaj ye khana banayeinge,

00:31:05.569 --> 00:31:12.448
yeh aaj kareinge - everyday, see, they are busy
with thinking too much. Inka liver aise hi
kharaab jaldi hota hai

00:31:12.557 --> 00:31:16.707
and thirdly, I think, this [UNCLEAR] 
ka tel; That's the worst of all.

00:31:16.707 --> 00:31:19.308
- Which?
- [UNCLEAR]

00:31:19.308 --> 00:31:21.028
- What's that?
- Peanut oil

00:31:21.028 --> 00:31:24.736
That's the worst thing because that
gives you leucoderma also.

00:31:24.736 --> 00:31:28.291
Issiliye aap dekhein ki Gujarati mein
bahut leucoderma hota hai.

00:31:28.294 --> 00:31:32.334
Know that disease of leucoderma that is
because of this tilli ka tel -

00:31:32.335 --> 00:31:39.125
absolutely, in the worst is peanuts
[UNCLEAR]. We never had peanuts in India.

00:31:39.128 --> 00:31:44.938
There's no word for peanuts in Sanskrit language.
It came from actually from the Gibraltar.

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:46.460
- Arabs, probably
- Annh?

00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:48.597
- Nahin, Arabs
- Maybe Arabs

00:31:49.534 --> 00:31:52.454
- This son was born in Dublin
- Where?

00:31:52.454 --> 00:31:54.444
- In Dublin - Ireland.
- Achcha

00:31:54.597 --> 00:32:01.061
- This in India
- India? There's no difference

00:32:01.103 --> 00:32:05.563
- Nice.
- But thoda hota hai. Isko, what is the
month he was born?

00:32:05.591 --> 00:32:07.764
- February
- What date?

00:32:07.764 --> 00:32:10.024
- 28th February - Pisces
- Pisces

00:32:10.033 --> 00:32:11.493
- Pisces 
- Pisces

00:32:11.493 --> 00:32:16.624
Pisces ashirwad hote hain bahut.
Issilie Mera cusp hai.

00:32:16.627 --> 00:32:20.407
- Cusp haan. Cusp [UNCLEAR]
- Aquarius and Pisces they'll meet [UNCLEAR]

00:32:21.567 --> 00:32:24.297
- When was he born?
- 31st of March

00:32:24.322 --> 00:32:26.752
- Aries
- Hmm, Aries
- Aries, Pisces

00:32:26.777 --> 00:32:30.137
- [UNCLEAR]
- You are Aries, Mother?

00:32:30.137 --> 00:32:32.527
I don't know. They say, I've born
at zero point

00:32:32.527 --> 00:32:35.867
because 21st March and at 12 0'clock
in the daytime.

00:32:35.867 --> 00:32:38.356
- I've done Your horoscope, Shri Mataji.
- Achcha!

00:32:38.356 --> 00:32:42.968
- It is .....
- Most interesting, lovely shape
- I cannot describe it even

00:32:43.308 --> 00:32:46.513
- Very regular
- Everything is so [UNCLEAR]

00:32:46.529 --> 00:32:49.129
- Very solemn!
- You cannot describe it.

00:32:49.129 --> 00:32:52.454
That's what he said also - Chaudhary,
who did it in New [UNCLEAR]

00:32:52.454 --> 00:32:55.436
- Yes, very interesting! 
- Most balanced thing because the

00:32:55.436 --> 00:33:00.626
center of India, center of this and all
that. Has to be, has to be balanced.

00:33:00.681 --> 00:33:04.581
When I have to balance the whole world,
I have to be balanced Myself

00:33:04.581 --> 00:33:08.581
but the way it has been assumed, you see, 
because, you see, others were born - all of them,

00:33:08.581 --> 00:33:13.626
at a point where there was some sort of an
imbalance and they came to balance it, sort of thing

00:33:13.689 --> 00:33:17.269
but Mine is at the balance point to
balance the whole world.

00:33:17.616 --> 00:33:22.447
But it is not in this horoscope -
it is impossible to analyze it because

00:33:22.447 --> 00:33:27.337
everything is so inter-related that if
you try and analyze it, you will be going

00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:32.940
I mean, re-valuing just something that's negative
- is that [UNCLEAR]

00:33:37.107 --> 00:33:42.727
Good! Are they alright now? Good. Let's 
see doctor sahab. Aayiye.

00:33:46.069 --> 00:33:50.379
Yahan to Gujarati's are doing nothing
for sahaj yog. You see Flash -

00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:54.740
there's the one who have Flash magazine.
They published so much thing about

00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:59.631
sahaja yog and all that - nobody; These
Gujaratis don't [UNCLEAR -WANT?]

00:33:59.631 --> 00:34:03.526
I wish, Mother, I could come and live in
London - I was just telling him in the planes.

00:34:03.528 --> 00:34:09.256
This year we were going to combine me and this
one and I said to him, "We haven't bought the house

00:34:09.256 --> 00:34:15.687
in Dublin, let's buy or live in London. At least,
I'll see people, our people and do something.

00:34:15.687 --> 00:34:21.094
- Dublin is very isolated, very gloomy.
- Nai but now you have done a job in Dublin - that's good.

00:34:21.378 --> 00:34:23.955
- You establish it well when you come now.
- [UNCLEAR] is the one.

00:34:23.979 --> 00:34:29.889
- You should give him full credit for - I'm not
- The way he met [UNCLEAR]

00:34:29.889 --> 00:34:34.433
I really remarked, the way you met these
boys. Where did you meet them? In the

00:34:34.488 --> 00:34:39.668
- Arre, the saddest part is
- No, the funniest part is that [UNCLEAR]

00:34:39.668 --> 00:34:46.439
- funny one man, brought me to the meeting.
- [UNCLEAR] how did he bring?

00:34:46.529 --> 00:34:51.839
- You know, he isn't admitting [UNCLEAR]
- Any guru comes, that good guru.

00:34:51.839 --> 00:34:54.930
So he said, "Why don't you [UNCLEAR]?
I said, "No, I don't want to."

00:34:54.948 --> 00:35:02.978
"No, go, go." So I said, "Okay, I'll go." I said,
and "Look it comes [UNCLEAR] will be there."

00:35:02.978 --> 00:35:07.231
So, I said, "I'd like to meet Paul." So I
said, "I'm talking to Paul [UNCLEAR]

00:35:07.231 --> 00:35:11.736
- Who spoke there?
- John. But I didn't even hear a talk, Mother.

00:35:11.736 --> 00:35:16.210
I know, I heard, all I heard was the way and
he said, "Sit down. Put your hands towards Me.

00:35:16.210 --> 00:35:17.588
- Did you feel anything?"
- Really?

00:35:17.588 --> 00:35:22.152
First my effort nothing but when I went
home then I got up at 3 in the morning

00:35:22.152 --> 00:35:27.758
and I was up because my hands, my feet
and my head were just hot - I mean,

00:35:27.758 --> 00:35:32.485
I was sweating there and then and I
couldn't sleep and I was sweating and

00:35:32.485 --> 00:35:37.557
I was in the next day, I went to the
meeting and I said, "Can I see Paul

00:35:37.557 --> 00:35:41.719
on his own on Fridays?" He said, "Yes, come
along," and I spent the whole day with him

00:35:41.719 --> 00:35:46.737
and stayed and I was. I didn't want to give
up the Paul one and I said, "No but this and that."

00:35:46.737 --> 00:35:51.694
but Paul just said, "Listen, listen [UNCLEAR],
he's very bad, give him up."

00:35:52.377 --> 00:35:55.777
- Then he came to the session
- Then, then Saturday he came and I was [UNCLEAR]

00:35:55.777 --> 00:36:01.131
decided it was too much. I mean, then I suddenly,
end began to dawn I might realize

00:36:01.131 --> 00:36:05.903
what's happening, in my realization even -
materially vibrations in a way - let's see

00:36:05.909 --> 00:36:09.549
- And one day the whole house became
- and one day the whole house is clean

00:36:09.618 --> 00:36:14.638
- In our house they came and
- hmm, but it was too much [UNCLEAR]

00:36:14.638 --> 00:36:21.024
He must be a real seeker, you see.
Normally, it's difficult to [UNCLEAR] horrible fellow

00:36:21.062 --> 00:36:25.872
[UNCLEAR] the law is very good. They
won't let me sleep in my own room.

00:36:25.872 --> 00:36:30.975
Paul put a kumkum, Swastika, almost 
everything. I said, "I'll be okay,"

00:36:30.975 --> 00:36:40.264
So they gave me a fancy photograph
of Mataji [UNCLEAR] and I [UNCLEAR]

00:36:40.264 --> 00:36:47.911
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:36:47.941 --> 00:36:53.006
- The whole house was different, totally different.
- There was no dirt in my house, there was no dust

00:36:53.006 --> 00:36:55.729
- Mother, we feel that
- [UNCLEAR] dust

00:36:55.729 --> 00:36:57.906
like somebody had put vacuum all over.

00:36:57.906 --> 00:37:04.538
- like marks. I said [UNCLEAR]
- Your Mother's drum is that na - Her name is that.

00:37:05.455 --> 00:37:11.435
All vacuum cleaner - a very big one
Know na - that's true

00:37:11.435 --> 00:37:16.816
But you see this, you must have been
impressed also by them, you see.

00:37:17.167 --> 00:37:22.417
You see because they are English people.
They know so much about your culture.

00:37:22.423 --> 00:37:27.053
Also, it's not possible; If you are not realized,
you can't talk to them anything about anything.

00:37:27.061 --> 00:37:31.661
If there are Indians, you can't talk to 
them about Christ; If they are English,

00:37:31.668 --> 00:37:36.168
you can't talk to them about Ganesha - 
it's like that - it's such a barrier

00:37:36.192 --> 00:37:39.992
but after realization you see, how 
homogeneous these all thing works out!

00:37:39.992 --> 00:37:43.745
How they understands! Very sweet
children, you know.

00:37:43.752 --> 00:37:48.522
You can see from their life how these are
sweet and balanced they are!

00:37:48.522 --> 00:37:51.618
This [UNCLEAR] must have told you.
He was a punkrop

00:37:51.977 --> 00:37:54.737
- He, he himself told us.
- He told this [UNCLEAR]

00:37:54.763 --> 00:37:58.583
- You see, everyone had different chat with me
- Hmm

00:37:58.583 --> 00:38:05.519
We cooked, I cooked, we ate and we go out. At 
12 0'clock after the [UNCLEAR] we went to the mountains

00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:08.890
- Moon and mountains
- [UNCLEAR]

00:38:08.890 --> 00:38:14.838
You know, so we did everything and I talk
each boy different time and they all told us

00:38:14.838 --> 00:38:19.618
- Allen was great he told [UNCLEAR]
- Allen told [UNCLEAR]

00:38:19.618 --> 00:38:27.279
that kumkum, who You are and he told who
Mahishasur baba is Mahishasur and Doug

00:38:27.302 --> 00:38:31.619
- couldn't of course come up so can't just
- Like them

00:38:31.619 --> 00:38:37.420
"He's this, he [UNCLEAR] this, I want
this, [UNCLEAR] do this," all this and

00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:41.271
- Douglas couldn't take it, he couldn't take it.
- Allen and Douglas

00:38:41.271 --> 00:38:44.470
- Even when he was shaking
- You know he was shaking and

00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:49.827
he couldn't, he just couldn't talk - he just
but, but, but - that's what but, but but

00:38:50.468 --> 00:38:57.408
but, but. Almost he can't, he came inside
the house this Sunday but [UNCLEAR]

00:38:57.526 --> 00:39:04.536
and he Ye Bible, I Bible, lastly he came 
in but he could such a word by [UNCLEAR]

00:39:04.610 --> 00:39:08.130
but I didn't know what to answer to him
[UNCLEAR]. I put word,

00:39:08.130 --> 00:39:11.330
I explained to him what he has today
but still no word is there.

00:39:11.330 --> 00:39:18.817
Everyday I come home from college 
[UNCLEAR]. So everyday I come [UNCLEAR]

00:39:21.607 --> 00:39:27.377
- but they'll go
- He doesn't know our agent [LAUGHTER]

00:39:28.633 --> 00:39:35.463
Such a, such a way to speak for that, age 61.
When you are that age, then you are doctor,

00:39:35.463 --> 00:39:41.353
then you are psychologist and you believe 
in God but you believe is this Mahishasur

00:39:41.353 --> 00:39:48.481
that doesn't mean everyone has to follow
and question answer you did with this
another doctor

00:39:48.497 --> 00:39:52.557
who is not his age but he should acted his age.

00:39:52.557 --> 00:39:57.880
You know you should tell him really, "Best
thing would be that it is that is how we
see everybody -

00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:02.325
that everybody is an agent but this is
something new." You see, it's like

00:40:02.338 --> 00:40:05.838
guru shopping going on, you see. You go
to this shop and that shop

00:40:05.838 --> 00:40:11.131
but this is a temple where you enter. This
is a temple - you tell him.

00:40:12.999 --> 00:40:16.889
You see now they have started another type
of a propaganda. Sometimes they say,

00:40:16.913 --> 00:40:19.433
"She doesn't need any money,"
but why do you need money?

00:40:19.433 --> 00:40:24.872
What do these people need money - parasites.
Money is not the point, it's not the point.

00:40:24.886 --> 00:40:28.846
Actually, it's much deeper than that.
Money, of course they are, naturally

00:40:28.846 --> 00:40:32.840
because they're so base and gross that they're
interested in your money and all these

00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:39.492
nonsensical things. That is obvious but 
the worse thing they do is to make you

00:40:40.088 --> 00:40:43.818
so much debased that you are possessed,
you see. They are possessed -

00:40:43.818 --> 00:40:49.573
- I mean, what is your situation?
- They took our 500 at the moment and

00:40:49.573 --> 00:40:54.831
- [UNCLEAR]
- We put our money to buy this house with Arvind

00:40:54.831 --> 00:41:00.908
I so much [UNCLEAR]. I didn't even say yes. I only said to him, we said to him,

00:41:00.908 --> 00:41:04.612
"Listen, you want the deal to be over, you
don't want to have. If we buy the house,

00:41:04.612 --> 00:41:09.312
we will make it into a sahaja yoga center and
we told you this." You know we said that.

00:41:09.312 --> 00:41:16.826
So he said, "We'll send some and nothing 
happened and the lawyer said [UNCLEAR],"

00:41:16.826 --> 00:41:22.237
so I said, I told that, "I want all of our money
back. None of that should belong to anybody.

00:41:22.237 --> 00:41:24.920
We lost, we worked for, we deserve
that money."

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:27.970
So the lawyer said, "Give him back,"
and [UNCLEAR] said,

00:41:27.970 --> 00:41:36.534
"He'll give you back 1500." So I still stuck
to the point that I want back so, next day

00:41:36.534 --> 00:41:43.488
he book it for 1500 and I said, "Okay, I'll settle
it up. Okay." Then he comes to the house

00:41:43.488 --> 00:41:48.321
and he says, "It was all because of me I gave you
check of all the money but the lawyer said that

00:41:48.321 --> 00:41:51.905
- we can't get you it all back because it's
not customary." 
- Which lawyer said?

00:41:51.905 --> 00:41:55.221
- It is not what - custom?
- It's not customary. The lawyer said

00:41:55.221 --> 00:42:00.321
it's in your interest to keep it so Douglas and
I had to keep and I had to kind of, say no,

00:42:00.321 --> 00:42:06.580
so my father said, "[UNCLEAR] we say yes
to the lawyer but you give me 3000 pounds

00:42:06.593 --> 00:42:10.653
in May or come to the Hudson David.
[UNCLEAR] but this [UNCLEAR]

00:42:10.663 --> 00:42:13.935
But, but why, why did you give
this money to him?

00:42:13.935 --> 00:42:20.850
You see, as I said Mataji, that man, that 
man working in psychiatric

00:42:20.850 --> 00:42:25.239
or with this Mahishasur, with whom we
visit every year

00:42:25.239 --> 00:42:32.447
he has this power to hypnotize or
mesmerism - something. When he says,

00:42:33.169 --> 00:42:38.849
you can't deny it. He says, "If this is
best, good for you," when he wants it,

00:42:38.849 --> 00:42:43.266
otherwise he says, "It's not, it's not good
for you because, you see, it's bad for you."

00:42:43.355 --> 00:42:50.135
- He has taken over complete me and him.
- He's very certain he's is mind control.

00:42:50.475 --> 00:42:54.875
You come inside the room and he'll pick up
all the tension that will belong to him

00:42:54.875 --> 00:43:00.606
and you work on it that way, so he's always at the
center of everything and you're little break [UNCLEAR]

00:43:00.614 --> 00:43:05.564
- So he asked for the money?
- Yeah, he said to buy the house and

00:43:05.564 --> 00:43:09.971
the way things are moving and my
husband in spur of the moment, say

00:43:09.971 --> 00:43:14.025
"Yes, that's the best idea. We'll buy your
house," which was the whole house -

00:43:14.025 --> 00:43:18.075
now he's divided; Half he's going to build
his surgery - that doesn't belong to us.

00:43:18.075 --> 00:43:23.271
Half remain here, "I'll work there, I'll live
there as a ready made secretary who's smart,

00:43:23.271 --> 00:43:28.222
take the phone messages because phone is 
their name, put Dr. Thakur's name out," -

00:43:28.228 --> 00:43:33.288
because his doctor and his practice he 
will lose, when he lives somewhere else.

00:43:34.086 --> 00:43:37.844
- Haan
- He's got all planned out from last Christmas

00:43:37.844 --> 00:43:44.422
and then he put us all in like that so I paid
in July before going to Saudi. From London

00:43:44.432 --> 00:43:50.022
I went back to Dublin to sign the contract.
Then from Saudi, we almost ran to say,

00:43:50.022 --> 00:43:54.649
"We don't want house, please dis 
close." "O, yes, yes." When I came back,

00:43:54.649 --> 00:43:58.573
he said, "No, no, no keep the house." He
told him, "Don't move out of house.

00:43:58.573 --> 00:44:02.395
Stay with your mother she needs you and
she'll save the money that way."

00:44:02.395 --> 00:44:06.822
One day, "Move out," next day, "Don't move
out," one day, "Do this, don't do that."

00:44:06.962 --> 00:44:10.872
- You see [UNCLEAR]
- and then he is so low Mataji -

00:44:10.873 --> 00:44:15.143
The influence on Jyoti he said, "Dhatt"
those things started to happen and then

00:44:15.143 --> 00:44:20.808
Sahaja yoga came to Dublin. He said in 
front of Jogin, "Well, buy the house,"

00:44:20.808 --> 00:44:25.980
I said, "We can't afford, we don't want to."
He said, "Give me your car," "I can't,
I don't want to."

00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:31.445
"Okay, you have insurance - haven't you?" and I
said, "What?" He said, "If anything happens to him,

00:44:31.445 --> 00:44:37.687
you can get insurance money and you'll
be okay," See, the mentality of the man!

00:44:37.687 --> 00:44:43.347
- It's disgusting!
- A Gujarati woman that I am born, to tell

00:44:43.347 --> 00:44:48.455
me that, I mean, I said, "No.. way, please
leave, I don't want to talk about it,"

00:44:48.455 --> 00:44:53.740
but I couldn't say - [UNCLEAR] when Jogin
said, "Get out," I couldn't bring out

00:44:53.740 --> 00:44:58.196
but I have nothing to do with the man who
goes that down, "Okay, if anything happens,

00:44:58.196 --> 00:45:03.044
- you have insurance."
- He's just, he's an embodiment of evil.

00:45:03.052 --> 00:45:08.518
- He's an evil disciple, just evil!
- Just imagine! How could he say such a thing!

00:45:08.518 --> 00:45:11.724
What's worse, he's a psychiatrist
and a doctor.

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:17.050
He's doing to people, weak people
who lean upon him.

00:45:17.050 --> 00:45:22.161
I mean, he doesn't understand even, really
the [UNCLEAR] India talk like this.

00:45:31.531 --> 00:45:37.131
- He'll be alright.
- I think, Vishudhhi is not really [UNCLEAR]

00:45:37.352 --> 00:45:44.722
Left. So just now you'll be in the same
house or [UNCLEAR]?

00:45:44.722 --> 00:45:51.351
No, we have rented the house from 16th of 
September and we have moved in that
rented house.

00:45:52.509 --> 00:45:59.389
Nice big house. We don't know Mataji
where we will be [UNCLEAR] this fellow
is in Saudi Arab.

00:45:59.623 --> 00:46:04.311
- There you are doing Medicine?
- Yes, Trinity College and this

00:46:08.112 --> 00:46:16.272
The things he has written if any body
reads, I mean, just, I mean, see one
sentence I must read it out to you

00:46:20.367 --> 00:46:26.062
which you'll be happy to know - I don't
know so many complications of course,

00:46:26.081 --> 00:46:29.931
this with that and that house with
that and this and.

00:46:40.103 --> 00:46:46.563
Serious life of course is very [UNCLEAR]
one [LAUGHTER]

00:46:48.053 --> 00:46:51.333
I hope he started feeling what he
was [UNCLEAR]

00:47:01.156 --> 00:47:05.586
You are still made to be sahaja yogi
- that's alright but

00:47:09.154 --> 00:47:13.154
yeah, something like Jupiter,
you see, that

00:47:13.212 --> 00:47:18.141
the trouble is, everything seems to be 
in it's house - see - this I can't understand

00:47:18.141 --> 00:47:23.164
how it is happening like this that Lord is in 
the house of the [UNCLEAR] he's going on.

00:47:23.164 --> 00:47:27.573
Achcha, the aspect of strong Jupiter -
Lord of ten, from an Aries sign, on the

00:47:27.573 --> 00:47:34.526
intellectual planet - Mercury - [UNCLEAR]
I think. Lord and Sub Lord of lagna -

00:47:34.537 --> 00:47:38.497
- Lagna is [UNCLEAR] ascendance
- Haan, Lagna Aapki hai Cancer

00:47:38.929 --> 00:47:43.869
- but Lord and sub-lord of lagna
- Yeh kya hai - because it's Kero system

00:47:43.869 --> 00:47:46.891
I know this chat chanting, called
Krishnamurthy system

00:47:46.891 --> 00:47:51.564
- Hunh - Krishnamurthy padyati
- Haan. He divides each house into 7 or 9 parts

00:47:51.564 --> 00:47:55.744
- Hunh
- and each part is ruled by a certain planet.

00:47:55.775 --> 00:48:00.458
So, if Your lagna, so according to
him Your lagna,

00:48:00.458 --> 00:48:03.076
- is in width 1, I think, according to him, I suppose.
- Jupiter?

00:48:03.076 --> 00:48:07.416
and in that part it might be ruled
by Mercury also

00:48:07.416 --> 00:48:11.196
- the Lord and the Sub-Lord of the Lagna
- I don't know, whatever it is

00:48:11.196 --> 00:48:14.536
- It's so complicated
- So, I can't understand this language, you see

00:48:14.545 --> 00:48:23.081
Lagna and also on Lagna [UNCLEAR] is seen.
On the intellectual planet Mercury,

00:48:23.097 --> 00:48:27.922
Lord and sub-lord of lagna and also on
lagna and the Moon, clearly indicates

00:48:27.922 --> 00:48:34.660
true wisdom, beyond mere human intellect
and intuition of a very high order;

00:48:34.807 --> 00:48:40.587
Intuition I don't have at all. I mean, whatever
I have, I have - it's no intuition, you see.

00:48:40.587 --> 00:48:45.694
[UNCLEAR] I see that. What is there to have
intuition? I don't know - whatever they call it.

00:48:45.696 --> 00:48:49.646
May not be the word for that in our
language, you see.

00:48:49.666 --> 00:48:53.296
In Hindi language, whatever I have,
what will you call that - intuition?

00:48:54.356 --> 00:48:57.466
I mean, I know clearly everything and
it is there, you see.

00:48:57.466 --> 00:49:01.696
- It's not intuition, it's perception, I feel
- This is the perception, you can say.

00:49:01.696 --> 00:49:05.266
- Insight - more insight
- Annh? More than insight, My intuition

00:49:05.292 --> 00:49:10.672
is My perception because then, you are a 
third person to do that but if you are that,

00:49:11.173 --> 00:49:13.919
- then what is it?
- [UNCLEAR] is chitta

00:49:13.919 --> 00:49:15.410
- Annh?
- Chitta

00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:20.894
Chitta is there - achcha. The Holy Mother
[UNCLEAR] is said so. The Holy Mother is in the

00:49:20.898 --> 00:49:25.698
Knowledge beyond human comprehension -
knowledge of the Infinite, of Divine Incarnation

00:49:25.698 --> 00:49:27.578
- for everything else.
- Hmm.

00:49:31.338 --> 00:49:36.324
Yeh baat sahi hai. This is the path, you see
but I don't know how you should say that.

00:49:36.324 --> 00:49:40.474
You see because, I mean, to Me it 
is such a common sense

00:49:41.437 --> 00:49:44.807
but logically you should arrive at 
that point. To Me, it is like

00:49:44.807 --> 00:49:48.605
can't understand, how you don't 
arrive at it logically with all your intellect.

00:49:48.615 --> 00:49:53.115
But to Me, it's not intelligence, I must
say, because intelligence you have to use to

00:49:53.125 --> 00:49:58.725
find it out but it's already there - for Me, it's
found. Like this is red color, in the same way,

00:49:58.725 --> 00:50:02.725
- everything is for Me that way.
- Mother, they all come from You, na.

00:50:02.946 --> 00:50:07.816
It is like the waves start, You know. The wave 
just sink at the center. You are the Self.

00:50:07.816 --> 00:50:13.846
That's why. So all sorts of things like 
this he says. Now, let's see how Gemini.

00:50:13.846 --> 00:50:20.396
The ascendance falls in Gemini even by Mercury.
That is to say, in the star of Rahu

00:50:20.396 --> 00:50:29.016
and in the sub of Saturn - the Sub Lord Saturn
as Lord of 9, is posited in a friendly sign Virgo,

00:50:29.016 --> 00:50:36.386
in the star of Mars. Lord of 11 is 
aspecting lagna powerful [UNCLEAR]

00:50:37.288 --> 00:50:43.628
- Actually Shri Mataji
- What is Gemini here, let's see where is Gemini?

00:50:43.628 --> 00:50:49.068
Gemini is lagna, according to him but 
according to English system Your lagna is Cancer.

00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:53.910
- Ascendant falls in Gemini.
- The ascendant is lagna.

00:50:54.496 --> 00:50:58.496
Should we say Your lagna is in Gemini but 
that is not true Shri Mataji.

00:50:58.496 --> 00:51:03.336
Ascendant falls in, ascendant falls in 
Gemini owned by Mercury.

00:51:03.337 --> 00:51:07.337
- Hmm. The ruler of Gemini is Mercury.
- No, I could be, why not?

00:51:07.337 --> 00:51:10.327
- Ascendance Gemini is [UNCLEAR]
- But it isn't Shri Mataji.

00:51:10.349 --> 00:51:13.001
- We have calculated it here.
- Achcha.

00:51:13.001 --> 00:51:17.331
- Your ascendant is Cancer - very clearly.
- Nahin par, you see, for Me, even if I am

00:51:17.331 --> 00:51:23.831
Gemini or anything, makes no difference because,
you see, if Gemini means the double thing,

00:51:23.831 --> 00:51:28.601
you see. I can, I am in a double; Mahamaya
is from Gemini only. You see,

00:51:28.601 --> 00:51:33.441
- Mahamaya Swaroopini comes from Gemini only.
- That is true. You see, there are two, You see

00:51:33.441 --> 00:51:37.985
there are two systems they have Shri Mataji.
One is, English system and one Indian system

00:51:37.985 --> 00:51:42.620
Even with this Gemini, it means I'm
a Mahamaya - nothing else.

00:51:49.829 --> 00:51:56.189
- But that that means Your lagnesh is Buddha
- It's [UNCLEAR]

00:51:57.954 --> 00:52:01.064
So that means You are ruled by
lagnesh of Brahmadeva.

00:52:01.369 --> 00:52:05.249
[UNCLEAR] lagnesh is Buddha - Mercury.

00:52:05.249 --> 00:52:08.409
But according to the English system Your
lagnesh is the Moon.

00:52:08.409 --> 00:52:11.117
- Annh?
- By English system, Shri Mataji,

00:52:11.117 --> 00:52:14.827
- Aapki lagnesh is the Moon - Chandra.
- Achcha!

00:52:14.827 --> 00:52:18.447
- but Your Lord
- Mercury, that is to say, in the star of Rahu

00:52:18.447 --> 00:52:20.877
- and in the sub of Saturn
- Hmm

00:52:20.877 --> 00:52:24.877
Isme teen cheezein hain [There are three
things in that] - Mercury, Rahu aur Saturn

00:52:26.392 --> 00:52:28.802
- It's too ....
- Rahu is feminine

00:52:28.802 --> 00:52:39.362
- Rahu is feminine? And Ketu?
- And Ketu... Ketu aur Mercury side pe
side hain samajh lo.

00:52:40.019 --> 00:52:45.396
- Rahu is Kundalini - no doubt
- And Ketu is which side?

00:52:45.396 --> 00:52:50.926
- 'Ra' is energy - Rahu
- And Ketu will be Sahastrar mein [UNCLEAR]

00:52:50.926 --> 00:52:54.926
- You can put it at Sahastra also
- Ketu could be atman or something like that?

00:52:55.056 --> 00:53:02.836
Ketu - Atma to agnya pe maana jaata hai waise.
Agnya par Atma ka - ki Spirit Christ hai, theek hai

00:53:03.556 --> 00:53:06.846
Agnya pe maana jaata hai. You
touch Spirit at the Agnya here first.

00:53:06.846 --> 00:53:10.846
- Yes.
- Issiliye ye Sadashiv ka sthan hai.

00:53:10.846 --> 00:53:16.746
- Spirit yahan hai aisa hai agya par.
- [UNCLEAR] Ketu, Rahu and Ketu -

00:53:17.636 --> 00:53:23.786
according to some traditions, Rahu is an aspect
of Shri Krishna and Ketu of Shri Ganesha.

00:53:25.244 --> 00:53:30.684
- they say but I don't know how correct that is.
- Rahu - Rahu should be Kundalini, I think

00:53:30.771 --> 00:53:33.721
- Ra-hu
- Ra-hu

00:53:33.974 --> 00:53:37.084
- and Ketu?
- Ketu could be [UNCLEAR] star

00:53:37.084 --> 00:53:44.724
Sadashiv, yes [UNCLEAR] it's always there and 
the two, the combination of the two, are 
really important.

00:53:46.705 --> 00:53:50.705
Achcha, let us see. Isme koi baat 
nahin likhi but you both [UNCLEAR]

00:53:51.281 --> 00:53:54.761
[UNCLEAR] is the story about how 
Rahu and Ketu is formed.

00:53:54.846 --> 00:54:01.276
No, Lord of the lagna is Rahu in My case - 
Rahu, the star Lord of lagna.

00:54:01.473 --> 00:54:05.623
Star lord - haan, that is different Shri
Mataji. There's two systems, You see.

00:54:05.682 --> 00:54:11.352
I know, I spoke to Tauji at great length - I know 
his style and first you have the lagnesh

00:54:11.352 --> 00:54:15.424
- Hmm
- and then within the lagna, within the
rashi of lagna,

00:54:15.424 --> 00:54:19.475
You have star, star - kya - how do you
say - tara, tare shubh [UNCLEAR]

00:54:19.475 --> 00:54:23.645
- Hmm
- and though Aapka lagnesh hai Budh hai

00:54:23.682 --> 00:54:28.472
- but taresh hai Rahu
- Rahu hai aur Sun hai

00:54:28.472 --> 00:54:32.402
[UNCLEAR] system is very complicated
- I can't follow [UNCLEAR]

00:54:32.402 --> 00:54:37.830
Haan Sun - Sun dekhiye Atmakareka -
Sun is Atmakarek.

00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:42.950
- That is atma
- Atmakareka - yeh atma ko pahunchata hai - Agnya

00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:48.070
One thing that is very clear in Your horoscope is
that the Sun is in the real Heaven of the horoscope

00:54:48.105 --> 00:54:52.211
and everything comes from there. You
remember, beautiful [UNCLEAR]

00:54:52.211 --> 00:54:54.566
- Hmm, Atma har
- [UNCLEAR]

00:54:54.566 --> 00:54:59.361
Sun gives you the Atma - Atmakarek.
Achcha, find out

00:54:59.361 --> 00:55:02.641
Ketu kya hai isme se abhi 
- batao Ketu kya hai?

00:55:02.641 --> 00:55:08.391
I think, Rahu should be that, Kundalini.
Haan, Rahu represents the Kundalini

00:55:08.391 --> 00:55:12.511
- Decided
- Haan, or the serpent power in the human body

00:55:12.511 --> 00:55:16.921
Wah, it's Atma gyan and Ketu kya
hai Shri Mataji?

00:55:17.414 --> 00:55:19.804
Ketu is the [UNCLEAR]

00:55:31.114 --> 00:55:37.144
You see, according to that padhyati, whatever
it is, I must say, it's a very deep thing - no doubt

00:55:37.144 --> 00:55:43.364
- because according to that thing,
- Is it?

00:55:43.364 --> 00:55:48.824
Haan, it's written, it is the storehouse 
of actually Divine knowledge and arises

00:55:48.824 --> 00:55:52.824
and manifests to perform it's functions 
at the whim of Bhagwati

00:55:54.183 --> 00:55:59.053
but only at the appropriate time according
to the karma of the individual.

00:55:59.053 --> 00:56:03.353
This has been verified through Ketu 
[UNCLEAR] cases; Means, it's only through the

00:56:03.353 --> 00:56:06.705
Bhagwati's krupa it is done
otherwise not.

00:56:15.232 --> 00:56:24.512
Alright, let's see. Iska, why I was saying this,
that also the sicknesses come from this.

00:56:26.717 --> 00:56:31.537
Astrological problems, you see - sicknesses
come from astrological problems.

00:56:31.537 --> 00:56:41.217
So, let us divide people into three gunas, first
of all. So we have got left, right and the center.

00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:54.850
So, the left are the people who are,
they're called tamasik but actually,

00:56:54.850 --> 00:57:06.030
are the people who desire more, act less
and those who have got cough as their,

00:57:09.116 --> 00:57:12.096
- as their - cough ko kya kehte hain?
- Phlegm

00:57:12.096 --> 00:57:15.112
- Phlegm
- Phlegmatic

00:57:15.112 --> 00:57:22.132
They're phlegmatic. So the right side 
people, are the people who are overactive,

00:57:22.132 --> 00:57:32.202
mentally alert, futuristic and also have
got these, what you call, bile - bilious

00:57:32.476 --> 00:57:38.486
- called as [UNCLEAR] in English
- biliousness. The central ones, are the people

00:57:39.527 --> 00:57:45.577
who have got [UNCLEAR - BILE'S OR WISE?]
attitude towards life,

00:57:45.577 --> 00:57:54.527
not competitive by nature, seeking, deeper

00:57:56.426 --> 00:58:06.366
not lethargic idea but seeking,
you can say like that.

00:58:06.727 --> 00:58:14.847
Now, these people are suffered from 
gas - wind, wind and gas troubles

00:58:15.493 --> 00:58:21.353
issliye, chana is the best.Chana is the best
for them; Chana to bilkul swargic cheez hai.

00:58:21.861 --> 00:58:27.872
Achcha, so let us talk three things over 
here. Then from triguna you can divide them

00:58:27.872 --> 00:58:34.692
into according to the chakras. So we have
21 type of people, we can say

00:58:35.768 --> 00:58:43.698
but two more I'll add, is the swing and the
mood - see, so we have 27 types of people.

00:58:45.213 --> 00:58:49.143
- Seven
- comes to 21 plus 2, twenty three.

00:58:49.143 --> 00:58:55.458
- two nahin - two ke bhi to honge na - three
- Sun, Moon is one of the seven chakras

00:58:55.458 --> 00:59:02.263
- Sun, Moon ke bhi trigun ho sakte hain
- Achcha! So six - twenty one plus six - 
twenty seven - theek - so

00:59:03.085 --> 00:59:08.005
So, Sun, Moon se ek aspect aur ho jaata hai.
There's another aspect with it with Sun and Moon

00:59:08.257 --> 00:59:20.027
but people who have more Moon in them,
are inactive in the organ.

00:59:20.349 --> 00:59:24.019
We may say, a liver patient is there - 
take an example - liver patient;

00:59:24.019 --> 00:59:30.119
So there is one cold liver and there's a
hot liver - see the combination.

00:59:30.183 --> 00:59:38.253
So the liver, if, even if it is showing a liver,
[UNCLEAR] it could be a cold liver or
could be a hot liver.

00:59:38.972 --> 00:59:48.692
So if it is a cold liver, then, maybe it 
might show on the left Swadhishthan.

00:59:50.109 --> 00:59:55.699
- Cold liver?
- Cold liver - left Swadhishthana and left
Nabhi could be cold liver

00:59:56.302 --> 01:00:04.912
- That is a classic.
- Left Swadhishthana and Left Nabhi could
create cold liver

01:00:06.060 --> 01:00:14.360
So, most of the allergies come to us, if 
they had, from there but from Swadhishthana

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:20.040
and Nabhi combination - left combination
- it comes, means Swadhishthana is
all unauthorized

01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:30.110
so we can say, from viruses or - same
sort of a thing like that -

01:00:30.272 --> 01:00:37.022
means to the cold liver side into that.
Psychologists have no issues from this.

01:00:37.295 --> 01:00:43.665
Is a horrible fish sadhna they are making
for sadhna. [UNCLEAR] Let's close this door.

01:00:43.665 --> 01:00:47.815
- Great speciality now - it's passing.
- Haan, passing and also, you see,

01:00:47.835 --> 01:00:50.795
- Sadhna wanted Me today
because daddy is not there
- Achcha.

01:00:50.795 --> 01:00:54.258
Daddy doesn't like the smell in the 
house. Just close the door. I'm sorry.

01:00:55.187 --> 01:00:58.737
- Thanks
- Horrible smell it is in that bag

01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:05.990
Sadhna is going away so she said. So, cold
liver - is it too much?

01:01:06.268 --> 01:01:10.898
- No, this one is
- Otherwise for some people it is an appetizer.

01:01:10.898 --> 01:01:21.240
- Yes. For us it is.
- Try - so, but for others they are
incapable of but you can have.

01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:32.871
So now, they have cold liver or hot liver
depending on the position of the Moon

01:01:33.568 --> 01:01:43.788
and the Sun. So the whole activity or
inactivity actually is done by these two.

01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:47.940
- By Sun or Moon.
- By Sun or Moon.

01:01:48.599 --> 01:01:52.929
If it is inacting, also there is disease,
if it is acting, there is also disease.

01:01:52.929 --> 01:01:56.149
You can have both - activity and 
inactivity - in which concern?

01:01:56.149 --> 01:01:57.789
- Here you can't
- That you can't

01:01:57.789 --> 01:02:01.734
- Normally you can't
- One is very active then some

01:02:01.734 --> 01:02:03.744
- Yeh nahin ho sakta
- Yeh nahin ho sakta

01:02:03.744 --> 01:02:08.644
but maybe, as a result of over-activity,
it can go out of order completely

01:02:08.804 --> 01:02:14.314
and then it will become absolutely inactive
- aisa ho sakta hai - ki at a later stage.

01:02:14.314 --> 01:02:21.474
Say person, who is very active, running up and
down, hain, then suddenly he becomes lethargic,
you see,

01:02:21.474 --> 01:02:27.274
he's so tired - that can happen to a person -
so, a person who has a very active liver,

01:02:27.737 --> 01:02:35.087
can develop a very inactive liver or who has an 
inactive liver, can always become active liver.

01:02:35.575 --> 01:02:41.215
So, then it can be a change from one to 
another but both cannot live simultaneously.

01:02:41.215 --> 01:02:46.994
- Haan, that's right, Shri Mataji.
- But why didn't they send some tea because
tea would be good?

01:02:47.503 --> 01:02:53.453
But what I said, now, You say some emotion
Mataji, does it mean where they're

01:02:53.453 --> 01:02:57.453
placed in the kundali, whether they are placed in the lagna. So they say, normal

01:02:57.453 --> 01:03:01.993
the Sun and the Moon is on the lagna 
[UNCLEAR] that is a very far fetched position.

01:03:03.473 --> 01:03:07.473
- [UNCLEAR] astrologer said so
- Achcha, he was just dealing with tatwa

01:03:07.473 --> 01:03:12.813
Tatwas. Let us go to the tatwas, you see.
Main thing is the tatwa and you can see

01:03:12.813 --> 01:03:19.183
in the body of a person, you see. A person,
who's very thin, say, who doesn't put
on weight and all that,

01:03:19.183 --> 01:03:24.253
definitely is on the right side. A person, who
is fat, puts on weight easily, is on the left side -

01:03:24.253 --> 01:03:33.649
is a general, general way you can see. In the
same time, you will be more on the fatter side,

01:03:33.649 --> 01:03:43.189
no doubt, because gas - vaat bhi mota karta
hai - but such a person will be light, you see

01:03:43.189 --> 01:03:47.512
- Not heavy
- Not heavy, not heavy - light, though

01:03:47.512 --> 01:03:51.882
he may be quite fat to look at, could be 
quite fat because of the gas, you see

01:03:51.882 --> 01:03:57.782
and he could suddenly thin down also; He may 
be thin or maybe - Mere saath to bahut hota hai.

01:03:57.782 --> 01:04:03.392
Sometimes in one day, I may look very much
thinned out, I mean, it happens really actually,

01:04:03.392 --> 01:04:10.122
My blouses, you see, suddenly become so tight,
if there is a Puja - even I can't take out the blouse

01:04:10.122 --> 01:04:14.122
and can thin down absolutely, you see. 
Same day if you take My photograph,

01:04:14.122 --> 01:04:20.472
you'll find two dimensions in My body 
because of the vaayu, see the prana vaayu

01:04:20.472 --> 01:04:30.112
in My this thing. Now, this is one point, that
we have to study the combinations in a person.

01:04:31.192 --> 01:04:41.912
So now, in our vibratory awareness, we should
find out what is his side - left or right

01:04:42.562 --> 01:04:49.202
so, we scan it first of all - alright? That's 
very simple to find out whether left or right

01:04:49.592 --> 01:04:55.192
If he's in the center, the vibrations will be 
flowing nicely, then he will be not so sick.

01:04:55.192 --> 01:04:59.192
Maybe, he might appear to be bloated
or fat, but that's not a problem

01:05:02.376 --> 01:05:06.926
because according to doctors, a man who's
fat, is sick, a man who is thin,

01:05:06.926 --> 01:05:12.852
is perfectly alright - is not true. All 
the gods and goddesses are all fat people

01:05:13.386 --> 01:05:18.226
even if they want. I mean, even if I lose 
weight, anything, I can't go down very much

01:05:18.226 --> 01:05:25.826
because, you see, the water and the air
always compose the, surrounds the chakras

01:05:26.613 --> 01:05:32.133
and so the person, the more who will expand
- even if you are thin, gradually will find

01:05:32.230 --> 01:05:37.500
there will be expansion on the and they 
will become heavier - all these chakras

01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:43.350
because they are to be protected because the 
more they start working it out, you'll see that

01:05:44.037 --> 01:05:50.633
but you can reduce it because gas can be
taken out of your body. So, for people, now

01:05:50.672 --> 01:05:56.582
we have decided, now there are three types. So,
for the first type of people, who are, say,

01:05:56.582 --> 01:06:02.057
left-sided, the thing is that they 
should be asked to put their

01:06:02.347 --> 01:06:06.647
raise their right and put down
their left.

01:06:11.362 --> 01:06:18.172
So, but the hand that is to be towards
the photograph, should be left;

01:06:21.447 --> 01:06:28.517
With the right hand you just take it out -
like that. The hand that has to use it,

01:06:28.576 --> 01:06:34.016
is your own hand - raising your own power
- you see and taking it out, the Grace,

01:06:34.016 --> 01:06:38.426
down below towards the photograph. Now,
then you are going to take vibrations

01:06:38.426 --> 01:06:43.456
from the photograph is a left-sided person,
put the left hand towards the photograph,

01:06:43.457 --> 01:06:50.847
left hand and right hand upward. Alright?
It's clear-cut now.

01:06:50.847 --> 01:06:56.458
- Yes, Shri Mataji
- Even bandhan should be given that way

01:06:56.705 --> 01:06:59.615
- 108 times it should be.
- Just one more

01:07:00.128 --> 01:07:06.778
Oh, let's see the left-sided problems, left 
sided. First is the inactivity of the organs.

01:07:21.071 --> 01:07:25.911
Inactivity of the organs, you see, that 
causes

01:07:28.231 --> 01:07:34.441
allergies, lethargy

01:07:35.230 --> 01:07:37.070
- virus infection
- Annh?

01:07:37.070 --> 01:07:42.349
- Virus infection
- What is? Virus infection. Woh to instant hota hai

01:07:42.349 --> 01:07:45.729
- aakarke jaata hai
- but some like cold and all

01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:50.960
Haan, but now, this we can say
basically but when it is triggered,

01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:57.418
these left-sided people when triggered,
then the, what happens actually,

01:07:57.431 --> 01:08:04.141
the left is controlled with the whole -
that's a difference between the two.

01:08:04.141 --> 01:08:12.491
Once it is inactive, alright, your, say, your 
liver is inactive. Till then if it is inactive,

01:08:12.491 --> 01:08:18.011
you'll have these troubles like that.
Then when it is triggered

01:08:18.582 --> 01:08:23.872
- it has been lethargic for so much time
- is triggered by some spirit,

01:08:24.234 --> 01:08:29.174
then the same liver will become
cirrhosis of liver or cancer of liver

01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:39.830
because suddenly from that sluggishness,
you see, all you're taken charge of others.

01:08:39.830 --> 01:08:44.859
That's the main thing you can say. The
spirit comes in and takes charge

01:08:46.315 --> 01:08:50.775
So such left-sided people can get
liver disease very easily?

01:08:50.775 --> 01:08:53.252
- Any disease.
- Hepatitis

01:08:53.306 --> 01:08:57.306
- Annh?
- Hepatitis, cirrhosis and cancer

01:08:57.551 --> 01:09:02.281
- Cancer, mellitus
- because if Ultimate is true, Shri Mataji

01:09:02.281 --> 01:09:07.140
but although in this country
[UNCLEAR] but yet

01:09:07.281 --> 01:09:13.481
cirrhosis of the liver is common in India
and we don't really not know the cause of it

01:09:14.332 --> 01:09:20.042
and they put Malaysia [UNCLEAR]. Probably,
India is on the left side itself

01:09:20.042 --> 01:09:23.092
- Indians are left-sided
- so when they get triggered all that is serious

01:09:23.101 --> 01:09:27.001
left-sided - Indians are very left-sided.
They are left-sided by nature.

01:09:27.256 --> 01:09:31.436
See, drinking is an artificial left 
sidedness because they are so egoistical

01:09:31.436 --> 01:09:35.676
that they cannot fully face their 
ego, so then they drink, you know,

01:09:35.676 --> 01:09:40.248
so that they go to the left side. 
It's an artificial left-sidedness;

01:09:40.248 --> 01:09:42.848
- Drinking is artificial left-sidedness
- That is true.

01:09:42.848 --> 01:09:47.828
But Indians on the whole are fate 
- believe in fate, for getting it

01:09:47.828 --> 01:09:51.659
- kismat hai
- Kismat hai but I would say,

01:09:51.659 --> 01:09:56.509
Indians are more in the center because
they don't sit down and cry and weep.

01:09:56.509 --> 01:10:00.999
They'll all say, "Doesn't matter, it's your fate."
But I would say, they're more in the center,

01:10:00.999 --> 01:10:05.592
not so much left-sided but cirrhosis of 
liver is caused, I tell you why.

01:10:08.411 --> 01:10:16.311
They have lethargic liver among
people who take things like -

01:10:20.265 --> 01:10:26.745
you can say, to make it lethargic is 
vegetarian food. Vegetarian food can cause

01:10:26.902 --> 01:10:30.442
- Vegetables are all in the left, annh?
- They're left sided

01:10:30.442 --> 01:10:33.628
- [UNCLEAR]
- Vegetables are left-sided, you see

01:10:33.741 --> 01:10:44.111
and that can cause constipation, too much
of, too much of, I mean, you have diarrhoeas

01:10:44.111 --> 01:10:47.681
and things like that; They can be 
very left-sided these vegetarians are.

01:10:47.681 --> 01:10:50.268
They also have bloated stomachs -
vegetarian food

01:10:50.268 --> 01:10:53.548
Bloated stomachs and they eat
too much rice

01:10:53.648 --> 01:10:59.368
Usse beri-beri jaisi bimaari ho jaati hai,
you see, so that, but rice also, if it is

01:10:59.967 --> 01:11:06.657
just carbohydrates, is alright but starch
and vegetables - they eat lot of starch -

01:11:06.892 --> 01:11:12.232
Potatoes, starch and vegetables - all
these things cause lethargy

01:11:14.542 --> 01:11:19.694
- Yes, true
- to the left side, you have to get to the protein

01:11:19.694 --> 01:11:25.886
- Protein ka digestion kaun karta hai?
- Protein digestion - it starts in the
stomach and then

01:11:25.886 --> 01:11:30.102
- Annh?
- starts off in the stomach and it carries
on in the, in the small intestine

01:11:30.102 --> 01:11:34.332
- and the liver karta hai carbohydrates?
- Yes. Liver has no part in protein digestion

01:11:34.332 --> 01:11:39.953
Annh? Nahin, nahin matlab par yeh hai ki
carbohydrates jo hain, that's the food
for liver - no doubt.

01:11:39.953 --> 01:11:44.783
- Haan, liver handles that
- You see so, though it doesn't play part

01:11:44.783 --> 01:11:50.387
in digestion but it uses the carbohydrates
in the body.

01:11:50.387 --> 01:11:59.567
Yes. Liver, You see, Shri Mataji, the liver is 
the only organ in the body that will burn fat

01:12:00.342 --> 01:12:04.342
- That burns fat?
- Haan, the only organ in the body
that can burn fat.

01:12:04.349 --> 01:12:08.059
It is the only organ in the body that 
can produce carbohydrate.

01:12:08.536 --> 01:12:13.446
- [UNCLEAR] produces?
- Produces, from fat, You see and thus
it stores carbohydrate

01:12:13.799 --> 01:12:17.799
and the way it burns fat - it reduces
the carbohydrates

01:12:17.799 --> 01:12:20.649
- Into?
- in the cycle - the citric acid cycle

01:12:20.667 --> 01:12:25.277
Haan, it transforms it, also removes the
[UNCLEAR - OIL?] but now,

01:12:25.277 --> 01:12:32.542
if you take the cirrhosis case in India,
it is because of eating fats,

01:12:33.203 --> 01:12:38.593
you can say. Always you'll find a 
vegetarian suffering from a liver trouble

01:12:42.050 --> 01:12:46.050
because carbohydrates
ka kaam saara karna padta hai usse

01:12:46.050 --> 01:12:52.590
kyonki they eat nothing but starch -
chawal aur these things

01:12:52.590 --> 01:12:55.710
- Potatoes
- Potatoes, this thing, that thing and liver

01:12:56.068 --> 01:13:04.028
is sustained too much, I mean, is 
given too much food - sort of thing

01:13:04.028 --> 01:13:08.628
- The rest of the body will starve
- Starve but liver is also starved.

01:13:09.009 --> 01:13:12.489
If you eat too much of these things,
liver then will be starved.

01:13:12.489 --> 01:13:19.049
If you give sugar to the liver, then
also liver will become lethargic.

01:13:19.113 --> 01:13:24.663
I mean, if you want to reduce the activity
of the liver, then you take sugar

01:13:24.813 --> 01:13:29.403
or carbohydrates - you follow My point -
but if you take too many

01:13:29.403 --> 01:13:34.753
carbohydrates already all the time,
then your liver will not function.

01:13:35.290 --> 01:13:39.820
Main thing liver needs, Shri Mataji, is 
protein because liver is pure protein

01:13:39.820 --> 01:13:45.310
- and the structure of the liver is based on protein
- and if you don't have protein in your food,

01:13:45.310 --> 01:13:47.950
- the liver will become lethargic
- Weak [UNCLEAR]

01:13:47.950 --> 01:13:52.180
Weak and lethargic. When it becomes weak, then
you get cirrhosis - you understand My point.

01:13:52.188 --> 01:13:55.598
- Yes, I understand perfectly.
- Vegetable bhi kya, carbohydrates bahut 
hota hai na

01:13:55.598 --> 01:14:00.538
[UNCLEAR] usme carbohydrate hota hai,
chawal khayeinge, they'll have rotis

01:14:00.538 --> 01:14:03.286
- but they'll not have proteins
- No

01:14:03.286 --> 01:14:07.096
that is why the liver is not sustained -
do you follow My point?

01:14:07.286 --> 01:14:11.286
and the same thing I happened to be [UNCLEAR]
diet because they are eating that sort of diet

01:14:11.875 --> 01:14:15.875
- and so they're becoming lethargic
- No, but first they were over-active,

01:14:15.875 --> 01:14:20.395
their liver was over-active that's why I 
said but now they should not. They can have

01:14:20.395 --> 01:14:23.383
now introduce some chicken and things;
Chicken is alright?

01:14:23.383 --> 01:14:27.243
- They have introduced some - haan
- Chicken and lamb you can introduce - alright

01:14:27.243 --> 01:14:34.823
So now we have these - one side is say, liver
or anything; On the left side now - cancer.

01:14:35.163 --> 01:14:39.163
Which one should we come to now?
Liver to ho gaya Swadhishthan chakra -

01:14:39.813 --> 01:14:46.803
Mooladhar - let us start with Mooladhar.
Now, left sided Mooladhara - impotency -

01:14:50.876 --> 01:14:58.376
- maane - inactive
- Hmm. Impotency, lack of interest

01:14:59.038 --> 01:15:01.088
Lack of interest in sex

01:15:07.957 --> 01:15:15.972
and too much activity on the right hand
side, can also become impotency, you see.

01:15:16.372 --> 01:15:21.099
If a person is over-active in early age, 
he can become impotent -

01:15:21.099 --> 01:15:27.359
- it's a result of that, as a result of over-activity
- [UNCLEAR] Sun, Mother

01:15:27.359 --> 01:15:31.089
- Haan, it's like that [UNCLEAR]
- [UNCLEAR]

01:15:31.089 --> 01:15:34.339
- Yeah, that's it, that's it
- Usually, the non-realized person,

01:15:34.339 --> 01:15:39.549
they cannot increase the energy in the 
sympathetic. Whatever energy he has, 
that we have.

01:15:39.562 --> 01:15:46.072
That he will decrease and he'll exhaust 
it, naturally because he'll exhaust his 
sympathetic energy, so this thing.

01:15:46.072 --> 01:15:53.782
Now for that, left side all of them, you
can use fire and you can use candle

01:15:53.782 --> 01:16:01.262
though it emits heat; Even the bhoots
emit heat, tremendous heat they can emit.

01:16:03.152 --> 01:16:07.152
- What about copper, Shri Mataji?
- Annh?
- The left side people - copper

01:16:07.152 --> 01:16:10.952
- Copper should be good for them
- They can eat from copper utensil

01:16:11.383 --> 01:16:19.823
Copper or gold. You see, if you burn gold,
say, you see, stone as we heat, is good for them.

01:16:19.823 --> 01:16:27.042
If they take, also for them raksha
- raakh - in the body, raakh or gheru

01:16:27.612 --> 01:16:33.549
all that [UNCLEAR] things. Like gheru - you
know what is a gheru, is calcium. [UNCLEAR]

01:16:33.549 --> 01:16:36.399
- [UNCLEAR] it's for children, calcium.
- The gheru is what you get

01:16:36.409 --> 01:16:42.149
Now children calcium. Left sided people
use these - the children calcium - gheru

01:16:42.699 --> 01:16:45.409
Then bhasma is [UNCLEAR], you see

01:16:45.409 --> 01:16:50.527
if you say, on Her photograph or you take 
it from My yagya, you see, that is for

01:16:50.527 --> 01:16:56.711
- the instance you have Herpes
- What are it's use [UNCLEAR] other that is

01:16:56.711 --> 01:16:59.681
- like bhasma
- in My photo, in front of My photograph

01:16:59.681 --> 01:17:02.911
- Yes, I used to light that on
- Yes, that could be used - yes, that could be used

01:17:02.911 --> 01:17:06.092
from these energy conditions, you see
- that could be used.

01:17:06.092 --> 01:17:08.252
- I used to find [UNCLEAR]
- Gheru you can use. Gheru,

01:17:08.252 --> 01:17:12.472
- what is gheru in English language?
- It's mud, it's like the earth which we use

01:17:12.472 --> 01:17:16.472
- It comes under muds from
- Remember the Mahashivratri puja in Delhi [UNCLEAR]

01:17:16.472 --> 01:17:21.912
I have applied, reddish color I've applied
so that is good for the left side.

01:17:23.337 --> 01:17:31.827
Now for the, now left Mooladhara is
best taken out, left Mooladhara,

01:17:32.819 --> 01:17:39.029
is by heating some fire - charcoal

01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:48.510
and put some ajwain on top of it and 
have a seat which has got a perforated top

01:17:48.510 --> 01:17:54.150
- Haan and sit on that
- and sit on that. Keep it on ground and in India, you see,

01:17:54.150 --> 01:17:57.610
people can sit like this, jaise [UNCLEAR]
karne baithte hain -

01:17:57.610 --> 01:18:01.610
aise isme bilkul tatta baandh lo.
In the tawa you put

01:18:01.610 --> 01:18:05.610
- charcoal
- charcoal, in that you put ajwain

01:18:05.617 --> 01:18:12.837
and just sit on that and take it - that's
the best for left Mooladhara,

01:18:13.372 --> 01:18:17.192
for left Mooladhara - alright?
Did you get My point?

01:18:18.579 --> 01:18:21.719
Then, the combinations of 
left Mooladhara.

01:18:22.992 --> 01:18:26.992
[UNCLEAR] are the causes - let's see
the causes - left Mooladhara.

01:18:27.165 --> 01:18:32.485
You can say first the over-activity,
secondly, it may be lack of interest

01:18:32.485 --> 01:18:41.858
from liver over-heating. Third will be,
too much conditioning. Fourth will be

01:18:41.858 --> 01:18:46.268
- black magic and all of this
- Absolutely. Black magic

01:18:46.303 --> 01:18:49.743
- Spiritualism
- Spirit or some sort of a thing like,

01:18:49.743 --> 01:18:52.803
Buddhism, some people call it -
they might be [UNCLEAR - PICKED UP?]

01:18:52.962 --> 01:18:57.932
because then, you see, they take them
to asceticism. Asceticism takes you away

01:18:57.932 --> 01:19:02.882
as lack of interest - you can have it. So
many gurus can do it; Rajneesh does that.

01:19:02.882 --> 01:19:12.291
He does. What is it that, he puts the Mooladhara
absolutely into inactivity and talks of sex.

01:19:12.982 --> 01:19:17.402
- He excites it
- No, he doesn't excite - he cannot excite it, I think

01:19:17.675 --> 01:19:22.815
What he does - he talks of sex and people
cannot have any sex, so it's a frustration -

01:19:22.815 --> 01:19:29.455
it means a frustration and a kind of a
inferiority complex may be developed.

01:19:32.380 --> 01:19:35.440
I see as far you are blasphemous
the Mooladhara is.

01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:39.440
- Hunh?
- If you speak blasphemy the Mooladhara chakra

01:19:39.817 --> 01:19:44.237
- It catches very much if you are, I mean, sane
- [UNCLEAR] anywhere

01:19:44.237 --> 01:19:50.182
No, I mean, if you say something about the
chastity of Mother [UNCLEAR];

01:19:50.182 --> 01:19:55.395
That is a point, one should be very careful
- now suspect the chastity of Mother;

01:19:57.583 --> 01:20:03.113
- That displeases Ganesha very much
- Of course and that will be in religion, the mahapaap

01:20:03.113 --> 01:20:04.923
- Mahapaap
- Parampaap

01:20:04.923 --> 01:20:11.983
Parampaap. That's worse than killing your
own mother - it is mahapaap;

01:20:12.361 --> 01:20:16.361
Uska koi prayashchit nahin hai
- martyrdom.

01:20:22.652 --> 01:20:29.192
And also, you see, saying, 'No'
[UNCLEAR] for

01:20:31.187 --> 01:20:35.957
ashleel jisko bolte hain - vulgar -
in the presence of Mother

01:20:36.309 --> 01:20:43.089
- Haan, in the presence but of course not true
- Inauspicious. Even describing something

01:20:43.089 --> 01:20:47.103
before saying, you must be on Mother, many
a times that this is a very vulgar word

01:20:47.103 --> 01:20:51.093
which will not be [UNCLEAR] tell you
because they have to tell you but

01:20:51.093 --> 01:20:55.243
ten times it should be to ask forgiveness and
all that and then it's alright but otherwise

01:20:55.243 --> 01:20:59.243
just to come out with a vulgar word that
he said like this or that is not good.

01:20:59.519 --> 01:21:03.519
See the, in the protocol of the Mother,
is very bad - it's very sensitive.

01:21:09.458 --> 01:21:14.398
Then it could come with a people or with
a woman who's possessed.

01:21:14.812 --> 01:21:21.662
- A man who's possessed
- A man or a woman who's over-aggressive.

01:21:22.517 --> 01:21:27.737
Can it come from a possessed mother
or someone that we have?

01:21:27.737 --> 01:21:31.880
Mother se nahin. Not coming from the
Mother; Mother is higher.

01:21:32.310 --> 01:21:37.360
This position, at this position,
it is a woman and

01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:48.990
the perversions, you see, in life - 
perversions in life it is

01:21:51.027 --> 01:21:56.237
because perversions is nothing but over-activity
and then it results in the inactivity.

01:21:57.069 --> 01:22:02.279
Mellitus is, I've seen Shri Mataji, is 
tends to be right sided sexual activity.

01:22:02.279 --> 01:22:12.288
No, when it is active perversion activity,
can result, results definitely into this.

01:22:13.213 --> 01:22:18.600
See, perverted activity is right-sided 
alright but it, from there it results

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:20.180
- in the left Mooladhara
- in the left

01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:23.704
- and then it becomes a habit.
- But what I've seen [UNCLEAR]

01:22:23.704 --> 01:22:29.324
Then it becomes just a habit. It's, there is no
self satiety as such but is a matter of habit.

01:22:29.324 --> 01:22:34.514
- That is true.
- [UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]
- but it involves that

01:22:34.655 --> 01:22:40.595
- Annh?
- But it starts in the right
Swadhishthana, I mean to say.

01:22:40.595 --> 01:22:42.951
Starts in the right but ends up there on
[UNCLEAR]

01:22:42.951 --> 01:22:48.313
I've seen the curve. It takes a curve 
from right Swadhishthana and then curves
into Left Mooladhara.

01:22:48.313 --> 01:22:52.473
- Hmm
- so it's very, You see, what I've seen,
it weakens there

01:22:52.478 --> 01:22:58.538
- I don't know how it works but it goes like that.
- Anything will weaken if it has a pressure on it

01:22:58.538 --> 01:23:02.538
See, there are all kinds of things which 
are nonsensical, you see and they naturally

01:23:02.538 --> 01:23:04.368
- will be weakened, isn't it?
- That's right.

01:23:04.438 --> 01:23:08.438
Naturally, I mean, [UNCLEAR], abuse, it's 
an abuse. You see, perversion is nothing

01:23:08.438 --> 01:23:13.878
but an abuse nonsense, you see, then it 
becomes a weak and a weak Mooladhara

01:23:14.345 --> 01:23:18.345
is very dangerous because with
a weak Mooladhara,

01:23:19.037 --> 01:23:24.417
you can get so many diseases of 
muscles. This is multiple

01:23:24.417 --> 01:23:27.257
- Achcha polymyositis, 
- All this

01:23:27.257 --> 01:23:35.107
[UNCLEAR], myasthenia gravis, all these.
All these polymyositis no one can
understand, Shri Mataji

01:23:35.735 --> 01:23:41.175
Muscle ka jo, muscle ka ek guna hota hai 
Stithisthapakta. English have removed it all

01:23:41.175 --> 01:23:45.775
that it goes back to it's own position
sthitisthapaka - flexibility

01:23:45.775 --> 01:23:50.385
- Haan haan, elasticity
- Elasticity you can say. Now which it stands up

01:23:50.385 --> 01:23:55.835
see, the projections of the hand and all 
that. All these positions are done

01:23:55.852 --> 01:24:00.632
through the power of Shri Ganesh.
That is His power.

01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:06.360
- So then what happens, that is lost
- Hmm, muscle becomes

01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:10.950
- muscle becomes - what you call that?
- [UNCLEAR] stone - flabby

01:24:11.067 --> 01:24:15.617
Flabby - it cannot raise your legs, see.
It loses it's elasticity

01:24:15.617 --> 01:24:19.617
- and heaviness can come
- In Hindi, in Sanskrit better word is, sthitisthapak.

01:24:20.059 --> 01:24:27.339
Sthitisthapak - it makes your state, establishes
your state - whichever state you want to be.

01:24:27.684 --> 01:24:34.844
- That's right! Sthitisthapak
- Sthitisthapak. Stithisthapak, so, that is lost

01:24:34.844 --> 01:24:37.344
and that's why Shri Ganesha then [UNCLEAR]

01:24:37.344 --> 01:24:41.254
all these troubles of the muscles, 
whatever you call them.

01:24:41.254 --> 01:24:46.964
- I don't know whatever you call them [UNCLEAR]
- Polymyositis, Myasthena Graves,

01:24:46.964 --> 01:24:54.964
- [UNCLEAR] muscle disease, that is Polymyalgia
- Achcha you don't [UNCLEAR]

01:24:54.973 --> 01:25:01.610
- [UNCLEAR] names [UNCLEAR]
- That's very true. That's why I'm at a loss Myself

01:25:01.610 --> 01:25:07.366
- [UNCLEAR] they're whole Latin and French
- Yes, lot of them, so the basis is

01:25:07.366 --> 01:25:13.716
one of the chakras has to be Mooladhar.
So, in any one of these disease, first give

01:25:13.716 --> 01:25:23.656
a bandhan with the candle to the Mooladhara,
just and Mahaganesha, Ganesha Atharwasheesha

01:25:24.056 --> 01:25:27.106
You'll be amazed immediately they'll start
raising their feet.

01:25:28.035 --> 01:25:31.785
Can we work on this area Mother
with the candle? [UNCLEAR]

01:25:31.785 --> 01:25:34.795
That second time because, you see,
it can work out anywhere -

01:25:34.795 --> 01:25:41.238
so the main point is there. Then it could
be at the, at the point, where we can say,

01:25:41.238 --> 01:25:46.528
the Swadhishthana point, could be at
Vishuddhi point or could be at Agnya point

01:25:46.828 --> 01:25:55.248
but first is that. First is Shri Ganesha. Then you
must backup Shri Ganesh with other combinations.

01:25:55.248 --> 01:26:02.598
You can feel it on your hands also but
some people don't feel Ganesha at all.

01:26:04.428 --> 01:26:10.268
You see, for example, to feel Ganesha,
you have to be sensitive for Ganesha.

01:26:10.268 --> 01:26:16.908
Like, those who have been hurt more on
Ganesha, in any way, can feel Ganesha fast.

01:26:17.414 --> 01:26:22.804
Indians don't feel Ganesha so much; 
Ganesha's chakra they don't feel so much.

01:26:22.804 --> 01:26:25.714
people n the West [UNCLEAR].

01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:29.240
That's why their Ganesha is so
strong with [UNCLEAR]

01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:32.055
- It's a sore point, bataya na. 
- Hmm, sensitive

01:26:32.055 --> 01:26:36.895
It's a sore point, it is hurt already, so
they feel it much.

01:26:38.705 --> 01:26:42.109
[UNCLEAR] after all Left Swadhishthan
- you have a Left Swadhishthan.

01:26:42.109 --> 01:26:44.345
- First thing you'll feel is the Left Swadhishthan.
- Always, maybe

01:26:44.345 --> 01:26:48.975
Anybody will have Left Swadhishthana wisdom,
will come out with Left Swadhishthana first

01:26:48.975 --> 01:26:52.455
though that person may not be having
Left Swadhishthana so strong

01:26:52.455 --> 01:26:56.455
but even the slightest thing because
he's hurt Left Swadhishthana will feel it.

01:26:57.370 --> 01:27:01.107
So, in judging a person, you must
always keep your chakras,

01:27:01.107 --> 01:27:04.117
which are permanently there, in view.

01:27:07.445 --> 01:27:12.895
Alright, so this is, these all muscular
troubles come from there.

01:27:12.895 --> 01:27:15.745
Shri Mataji, one thing that, a lot of
these muscular troubles

01:27:15.751 --> 01:27:21.471
do they happen in children, they start in
children because of some poorva.....

01:27:21.471 --> 01:27:25.391
See, poorva janmas of course are
there and children also

01:27:27.140 --> 01:27:32.440
you see, the sanskaras of parents, very
important. Parents are very important

01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:34.564
at the time the child is to be born.

01:27:35.155 --> 01:27:38.665
What sort of parents they have,
what kind of life they lead.

01:27:38.665 --> 01:27:44.355
- Supposing, a father goes to a prostitute
- Then the whole marriage is destroyed

01:27:44.355 --> 01:27:49.726
That's it. You see, the mother is, say, flirts
with another man when she's pregnant.

01:27:54.126 --> 01:27:59.720
That time it's a question of complete
purity, otherwise child is affected.

01:28:03.139 --> 01:28:07.739
Then naturally, it happens naturally,
atmosphere.

01:28:08.367 --> 01:28:12.157
You see, if supposing, mother is pregnant
and - here it is so common.

01:28:12.546 --> 01:28:16.346
They're least bothered about the 
auspiciousness - a pregnant mother will

01:28:16.346 --> 01:28:19.961
- Smoke
- Smoke - not only smoke - they go to

01:28:19.961 --> 01:28:24.421
parties, flirt with other men, do all these
sorts of a dirty things and all that and

01:28:24.765 --> 01:28:28.765
see, that kind of [UNCLEAR] here.

01:28:32.272 --> 01:28:38.472
Also, there are some others who don't
understand how to deal with the children

01:28:38.472 --> 01:28:42.742
as far as the sex is concerning. They're
very, can be very aggressive also

01:28:42.750 --> 01:28:47.660
with the children how to handle the sex 
carefully, you see, when they're washing,

01:28:47.660 --> 01:28:51.260
- bathing and all that. They can become
- Achcha, haan

01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:52.990
- so the very
- rough

01:28:52.990 --> 01:28:57.236
rough handling of the child can cause
- rough handling of the child.

01:28:58.379 --> 01:29:02.379
No that happens and we see that happens
specially in this country, Shri Mataji,

01:29:02.379 --> 01:29:07.608
where it produces a type of adult 
disease, phimosis, You see

01:29:07.630 --> 01:29:13.325
and where the skin gets
all constricted. Very common in India,

01:29:13.325 --> 01:29:17.390
very common in India but in New Jersey
it's very rare to find.

01:29:17.894 --> 01:29:22.294
In India, you see, even if you are poor,
as far as children are concerned,

01:29:22.294 --> 01:29:26.074
you're trained very well how to handle
the child and all. Very auspiciousness,

01:29:26.074 --> 01:29:32.178
is the main point na, that's the thing; It
is deeper - that affects more the chakra of

01:29:32.742 --> 01:29:37.612
- Mooladhara because it is auspiciousness
- hmm, mangal.

01:29:37.612 --> 01:29:43.192
This is the chakra of auspiciousness, so it
affects, you see. Even if your mind is dirty,

01:29:43.192 --> 01:29:48.592
you're pregnant and you have dirty thoughts,
it affects; Is the question of auspiciousness

01:29:49.535 --> 01:29:53.875
which people don't understand in the West
at all. Auspiciousness is lost in it.

01:29:54.689 --> 01:29:58.819
[UNCLEAR] told me Mother,
to start to understand it.

01:29:58.820 --> 01:30:04.000
India, for Mooladhara, is first class. You
see, sit on the ground, Mother India

01:30:04.282 --> 01:30:09.822
She sucks in, She's very pure that way.
For that, that is the best. India is best

01:30:09.822 --> 01:30:15.108
for Mooladhara, no doubt. There's nothing
better than that because you have the

01:30:15.108 --> 01:30:21.451
Kundalini itself is. That way She clears you
of the Mooladhara. Specially in Maharashtra,

01:30:21.451 --> 01:30:26.560
I think, the Maharashtra bhumi is really
beautiful and you know people take their

01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:32.710
in that mud. In India on the river they'll
go, get some mud, put it to their body

01:30:32.710 --> 01:30:38.080
and jump in the water for their bath - 
finished - they're true. No one smells.

01:30:38.104 --> 01:30:43.864
How many Indians smell. You see, this smelling
business is only special of Western people.

01:30:43.878 --> 01:30:48.698
I used to notice that Shri Mataji. In India, 
sometimes, You see, I mean for one week

01:30:48.698 --> 01:30:54.411
or ten days, if we are travelling, we don't
bathe but I never used to smell. Here even

01:30:54.487 --> 01:31:00.711
- we bathe twice a day, isn't [UNCLEAR]
- Just see! This place is a, I don't know

01:31:00.711 --> 01:31:03.321
what is the reason but it is comes
from Mother Earth na -

01:31:03.321 --> 01:31:04.711
the fragrance comes from Mother Earth.

01:31:04.711 --> 01:31:10.771
So, one of the things that form the 
lethargy, this thing would be also

01:31:11.611 --> 01:31:17.121
right side Mooladhara catching - you always
get bad smell come out

01:31:17.325 --> 01:31:23.425
- Hmm, right Mooladhara
- Right, left but, you see, this funny smell

01:31:23.425 --> 01:31:26.444
- in both the cases.
- I know how it smells like a sick smell

01:31:26.444 --> 01:31:30.884
- Hmm
- tangy smell. I used to notice it a lot here

01:31:30.884 --> 01:31:36.904
And from the left sided [UNCLEAR],
you see,

01:31:36.904 --> 01:31:45.454
I think, Mooladhara you can get children
which are not, will be loyal or something

01:31:45.454 --> 01:31:50.275
you see, because, if the left side is 
caught up, you might get children with

01:31:50.275 --> 01:31:56.505
mental problems also - left side is
caught up - left Mooladhara is caught up.

01:31:56.505 --> 01:31:59.725
We'll say, it's special of mind, you see,
is the base of the mind.

01:31:59.725 --> 01:32:02.581
- Manas
- Manas - the whole manas starts from there

01:32:02.581 --> 01:32:05.056
- Epilepsy in children
- Yes, epilepsy in children

01:32:05.056 --> 01:32:09.392
even you can get if your Mooladhara
is not, it'll be, if you're having
