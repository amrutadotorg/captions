00:07:24.757 --> 00:07:41.826
So now we will be going for our further movement
and I may have to return back to Bombay.

00:07:41.926 --> 00:08:01.597
I do not know how comfortable you were here,
but you wanted to be away from the maddening

00:08:01.597 --> 00:08:11.417
crowd and I thought this would be the nice
place to be here though Dhumal was all the

00:08:11.417 --> 00:08:16.767
time insisting that they should stay in some
Mangalkaryalay or something.

00:08:16.767 --> 00:08:22.937
But I told him, “You don’t understand
them, they don’t enjoy much of all this

00:08:22.937 --> 00:08:23.937
cement, concrete.”

00:08:23.937 --> 00:08:39.337
They would always like to be in the company
of nature as long as they get some protection

00:08:39.337 --> 00:08:46.647
from the sun and the rain and they want to
enjoy that kind of a collective living and

00:08:46.647 --> 00:08:47.647
they’ll be very happy.

00:08:47.647 --> 00:08:52.507
But still I don’t think he was very much
convinced about it, very hesitant.

00:08:52.507 --> 00:08:59.267
Then again he came to Bombay, I again told
him, “Now believe Me, you have to have it

00:08:59.267 --> 00:09:00.267
somewhere.

00:09:00.267 --> 00:09:05.477
You just have a pendal for them, they’ll
be very happy, you just don’t worry about

00:09:05.477 --> 00:09:06.477
other things.

00:09:06.477 --> 00:09:09.117
They want to be with the nature because they
don’t get a chance like that.

00:09:09.117 --> 00:09:15.097
They cannot take bath in a lake anywhere,
it’s a great chance for them to take a bath.”

00:09:15.097 --> 00:09:19.917
They said the water is not so clean and maybe
that it is full of clay.

00:09:19.917 --> 00:09:25.917
I said, “Clay is good for them, they’ll
like it, there’s …” And I see your skin,

00:09:25.917 --> 00:09:32.607
it’s so much better, I see your skin, you
see all this you have suffered the sun burnt,

00:09:32.607 --> 00:09:38.987
whatever you overdid in Ganapatipule, is now
being cleared out by this clay because the

00:09:38.987 --> 00:09:40.997
clay is the one that soothes you.

00:09:40.997 --> 00:09:46.457
Even if you can put some clay on your stomach,
it will take out all the heat from your stomach,

00:09:46.457 --> 00:09:49.367
very good for liver this clay is.

00:09:49.367 --> 00:09:55.327
So, I told them that you don’t understand
that this natural naturopathy that they can

00:09:55.327 --> 00:09:57.357
have here, they cannot have it.

00:09:57.357 --> 00:10:03.497
But he very, very reluctantly agreed thinking
that I’m really trying to be hard on you.

00:10:03.497 --> 00:10:24.787
So, this is a mild sun here and it’s nice
and the atmosphere is very clear and clean,

00:10:24.787 --> 00:10:30.157
plus you have got such a beautiful temple
of Ekadesha Rudra here which is such a nice

00:10:30.157 --> 00:10:32.077
place we have found out.

00:10:32.077 --> 00:10:38.367
So for a saint, you see, for a saintly person,
what does he need?

00:10:38.367 --> 00:10:40.417
Because he’s so satisfied with everything.

00:10:40.417 --> 00:10:42.367
Whatever he gets he’s satisfied.

00:10:42.367 --> 00:10:50.527
But he will be more satisfied, he would be
much more enjoying when he’s with the nature.

00:10:50.527 --> 00:10:52.137
I know that.

00:10:52.137 --> 00:10:57.997
And, they are not still very happy the Rahuri
people that they think that this is no way

00:10:57.997 --> 00:11:01.637
of putting up guests like this and all that,
still.

00:11:01.637 --> 00:11:08.087
I just had to tell him that you see their
faces, how they look, they look so very happy,

00:11:08.087 --> 00:11:11.107
so very relaxed, now what do you want?

00:11:11.107 --> 00:11:14.417
What do you want more?

00:11:14.417 --> 00:11:20.877
But now we must understand that one habit
that we have always, we have developed it

00:11:20.877 --> 00:11:22.387
because we have been going out.

00:11:22.387 --> 00:11:26.917
Our attention has been going out.

00:11:26.917 --> 00:11:30.407
You see the one habit that we have in the
West, which I have noticed also, very common,

00:11:30.407 --> 00:11:37.456
is, to be a daredevil for everything and to
go to the extreme.

00:11:37.456 --> 00:11:39.436
You see there’s no …

00:11:39.436 --> 00:11:45.046
[Shri Mataji asks a yogi] How do you say to
the bridle?

00:11:45.046 --> 00:11:50.896
Bridle you say, the one that is used for the
horse?

00:11:50.896 --> 00:11:52.097
Bridle.

00:11:52.097 --> 00:11:53.566
The bridle is not there.

00:11:53.566 --> 00:11:56.366
There’s no bridle, in our behavior.

00:11:56.366 --> 00:11:59.176
We go to extremes in everything.

00:11:59.176 --> 00:12:01.866
Whatever we do, we go to extremes.

00:12:01.866 --> 00:12:08.736
There’s no bridle in our hands and this
is what, one has to get to the bridle.

00:12:08.736 --> 00:12:22.407
It is not that, it’s like a kite which is
just moving here and there, it’s not that.

00:12:22.407 --> 00:12:30.606
It’s a complete thrust, complete movement
with all will power, with all effort, to go

00:12:30.606 --> 00:12:34.756
to something that is dangerous.

00:12:34.756 --> 00:12:42.796
I personally think it’s a self-destructive
character which is built within us as a result

00:12:42.796 --> 00:12:45.627
of our movement too much outward.

00:12:45.627 --> 00:12:52.396
Because whatever moves in one direction has
to recoil back, it has a reaction.

00:12:52.396 --> 00:12:55.616
Like the science has developed atomic bomb.

00:12:55.616 --> 00:13:03.377
Ultimately you do develop a destructive temperament
and that is why I think in the west people

00:13:03.377 --> 00:13:09.736
have no idea how to control the speed backwards.

00:13:09.736 --> 00:13:15.337
It’s more the speed outward to dangerous
places they like it.

00:13:15.337 --> 00:13:17.146
Nature is good.

00:13:17.146 --> 00:13:19.837
In the nature it’s nice to be there.

00:13:19.837 --> 00:13:26.676
But it does not mean that you should ask the
nature to hit you and kill you.

00:13:26.676 --> 00:13:31.456
Now in Ganapatipule I was so sad to see those
boys who burnt themselves.

00:13:31.456 --> 00:13:37.627
It was really very, very saddening to Me and
when I treated them, of course they got well

00:13:37.627 --> 00:13:40.717
but you wont’ believe the whole of My stomach
here, [SHRI MATAJI PUTS HER HAND ON HER STOMACH]

00:13:40.717 --> 00:13:51.576
the whole skin of My stomach was burnt, charred
and burnt and is now peeling out, just like

00:13:51.576 --> 00:13:56.576
they had the problem, I never went to the
sea, I never stayed there.

00:13:56.576 --> 00:14:01.057
So, this was the heat they were carrying.

00:14:01.057 --> 00:14:09.717
Now people get, say, what you call, skin troubles,
skin cancers.

00:14:09.717 --> 00:14:11.907
Still they want to do it.

00:14:11.907 --> 00:14:19.786
Like the other lady who was so sick from Switzerland
is so sick, you see, I was really very worried

00:14:19.786 --> 00:14:27.126
because she was very dangerously placed and
she is the one who had this problem and she

00:14:27.126 --> 00:14:30.407
said, “I have an addiction with the sun.”

00:14:30.407 --> 00:14:32.926
How can you be addicted to the sun?

00:14:32.926 --> 00:14:36.127
Is just a mental idea.

00:14:36.127 --> 00:14:43.896
And believe Me, it’s just a mental idea
that if you go in the sun your skin will be

00:14:43.896 --> 00:14:44.896
all right.

00:14:44.896 --> 00:14:46.676
It’s just a mental idea.

00:14:46.676 --> 00:14:53.087
Have you seen anyone like that?

00:14:53.087 --> 00:14:58.837
I mean what is the proof that if you go in
the sun your skin will improve, what is the

00:14:58.837 --> 00:14:59.837
proof?

00:14:59.837 --> 00:15:07.027
We Indians never, never go in the sun.

00:15:07.027 --> 00:15:08.027
Never.

00:15:08.027 --> 00:15:16.247
We never go in a windy place, never in a windy
place, we never go, say for example this skiing.

00:15:16.247 --> 00:15:19.186
According to us skiing is a stupid job.

00:15:19.186 --> 00:15:21.076
We would never do it.

00:15:21.076 --> 00:15:27.356
Any Indian who does that is a stupid fellow
according to us.

00:15:27.356 --> 00:15:33.446
Women will never do horse riding because it
affects the uterus.

00:15:33.446 --> 00:15:38.796
The women don’t swim after sometime because
it affects the uterus and if it affects the

00:15:38.796 --> 00:15:49.196
uterus, it affects the whole system because
uterus represents your Kundalini.

00:15:49.196 --> 00:15:51.127
All wrong ideas you have got.

00:15:51.127 --> 00:15:54.857
That’s why I see that in the West everybody
is sick.

00:15:54.857 --> 00:15:59.507
They have this trouble or that trouble or
this or that.

00:15:59.507 --> 00:16:05.577
Certain principles are to be borne in our
mind because we are saints and we are precious

00:16:05.577 --> 00:16:06.577
things.

00:16:06.577 --> 00:16:11.327
We are not like other Westerners, that we
can waster our life like this for some sort

00:16:11.327 --> 00:16:14.637
of a stupid venture that we think of .

00:16:14.637 --> 00:16:17.947
Can you imagine all Indians have much better
skin than you have.

00:16:17.947 --> 00:16:19.627
All right.

00:16:19.627 --> 00:16:21.317
Don’t they?

00:16:21.317 --> 00:16:26.167
Do they ever go in the sun?

00:16:26.167 --> 00:16:29.867
Never.

00:16:29.867 --> 00:16:33.717
Have you seen any Indian sitting outside here
taking sunbath?

00:16:33.717 --> 00:16:40.787
I mean the proof of the pudding is that despite
all that your skins are so bad.

00:16:40.787 --> 00:16:47.247
Now how can your skin be good with the sun,
let us see.

00:16:47.247 --> 00:16:52.507
Let us say, Let us take absolutely a chemical
reaction.

00:16:52.507 --> 00:17:00.357
Now what happens that when the, the thing
falls upon our skin or upon our head, this

00:17:00.357 --> 00:17:04.397
head has got a brain and the brain is made
of fat.

00:17:04.397 --> 00:17:05.397
All right?

00:17:05.397 --> 00:17:10.497
Now if you put the fat in the sun, what will
happen?

00:17:10.497 --> 00:17:12.027
It will melt.

00:17:12.027 --> 00:17:15.577
And that’s how people have melted brains.

00:17:15.577 --> 00:17:23.117
The brains are not normal, they behave in
a way which I don’t understand why they

00:17:23.117 --> 00:17:25.187
behave like this.

00:17:25.187 --> 00:17:32.857
So first of all if your brain goes out, how
can your skin be all right?

00:17:32.857 --> 00:17:35.667
Because the brain controls the skin.

00:17:35.667 --> 00:17:36.667
It controls everything.

00:17:36.667 --> 00:17:48.337
If your brain goes off, I’ve not met one
person who looks beautiful because he has

00:17:48.337 --> 00:17:53.587
been in the sun.

00:17:53.587 --> 00:17:58.887
On the contrary, you stay at home.

00:17:58.887 --> 00:18:00.137
Preserve your skin by staying at home.

00:18:00.137 --> 00:18:10.927
The second point is that a Sahaja Yogi should
not behave like other Westerners do that at

00:18:10.927 --> 00:18:13.797
every holiday, they’re out.

00:18:13.797 --> 00:18:17.457
They never sit in the house.

00:18:17.457 --> 00:18:18.457
Gruhastha.

00:18:18.457 --> 00:18:20.797
The one who stays in the house.

00:18:20.797 --> 00:18:23.357
We are all Gruhasthas, householders, we are
married people.

00:18:23.357 --> 00:18:25.597
As soon as you get a holiday you’re out.

00:18:25.597 --> 00:18:31.897
Now you might give an explanation, “Because
you see our houses are like this and, we think

00:18:31.897 --> 00:18:36.047
that our houses are just suffocating us.”

00:18:36.047 --> 00:18:39.737
Have you seen the houses of the poor people
here?

00:18:39.737 --> 00:18:42.747
Have you seen the houses of the labor in Bombay?

00:18:42.747 --> 00:18:46.277
Nobody goes out for a holiday.

00:18:46.277 --> 00:18:52.907
All My life I don’t think I’ve been ever
out for a holiday with My husband.

00:18:52.907 --> 00:18:57.147
Only once we tried for two days and we were
back from Scotland all the way.

00:18:57.147 --> 00:19:04.297
We just go for a wedding or a festival or
something like that.

00:19:04.297 --> 00:19:08.387
If there’s some collective happening or
else you can go for a picnic, all of you together.

00:19:08.387 --> 00:19:15.527
But you must sit down in the house and talk
to each other nicely, there should be some

00:19:15.527 --> 00:19:16.527
rapport.

00:19:16.527 --> 00:19:19.917
There’s no rapport between the children
and the parents, there’s no rapport between

00:19:19.917 --> 00:19:29.477
the husband and the wife, no rapport between
the in-laws, other people, no rapport at all.

00:19:29.477 --> 00:19:37.127
So you become people who are absolutely secluded,
shooting off this way, that way, that way.

00:19:37.127 --> 00:19:40.927
Sit down and talk.

00:19:40.927 --> 00:19:45.877
Now you see our children, now we talk that
our children should be disciplined.

00:19:45.877 --> 00:19:50.907
The best way to discipline your child is to
make the child sit down for a while and talk

00:19:50.907 --> 00:19:53.337
to the child properly.

00:19:53.337 --> 00:19:59.967
Tell the child what he’s supposed to do.

00:19:59.967 --> 00:20:02.987
You’ll find an Indian child goes to somebody’s
house just keeps quite.

00:20:02.987 --> 00:20:05.197
But let an English child come.

00:20:05.197 --> 00:20:12.417
He will break this, he’ll break that, give
me chocolates, give me this, I want this.

00:20:12.417 --> 00:20:18.537
You take an Indian child, maybe a poor child
to a market, he’ll never ask for anything,

00:20:18.537 --> 00:20:19.537
demand for anything.

00:20:19.537 --> 00:20:20.537
Never.

00:20:20.537 --> 00:20:22.487
Even if you give, he’ll say, “No, I won’t
have.”

00:20:22.487 --> 00:20:24.407
He has that self-respect.

00:20:24.407 --> 00:20:30.457
But if you take a child, any other child,
he’ll say, “Please buy me this, please

00:20:30.457 --> 00:20:31.817
buy me that, please buy me that.”

00:20:31.817 --> 00:20:37.657
Without any self-respect, without any discipline.

00:20:37.657 --> 00:20:40.617
Now where does the discipline come up?

00:20:40.617 --> 00:20:45.837
Now what we do, supposing a child is there,
we are going out, we tell the child, “Now

00:20:45.837 --> 00:20:53.707
we are going out, and you have to be a self-respecting
child because,” supposing now you are talking

00:20:53.707 --> 00:20:57.917
you can say, “You are a realized soul, you
are a Sahaja Yogi and you can’t behave like

00:20:57.917 --> 00:21:04.007
a stupid fellow asking for this and that,”
and sit down quietly, make them sit down.

00:21:04.007 --> 00:21:07.787
To begin with, you have to do lot of massaging
on their body.

00:21:07.787 --> 00:21:15.617
Lots of massaging, everyday massage, massage,
massage the body so the nerves are all right.

00:21:15.617 --> 00:21:24.377
Then, when you take them out or do anything,
before hand, tell them properly, build up

00:21:24.377 --> 00:21:29.277
their personality of self-respect, of discipline.

00:21:29.277 --> 00:21:33.587
But you yourself should be disciplined, now
you are sitting in the sun, say, for the whole

00:21:33.587 --> 00:21:37.737
day and you tell your son, “Get inside the
house,” how will he?

00:21:37.737 --> 00:21:41.157
A Sahaja Yogi should never go in the sun.

00:21:41.157 --> 00:21:42.637
Take it from Me.

00:21:42.637 --> 00:21:45.387
Never, never go in the sun.

00:21:45.387 --> 00:21:53.487
Because this brain requires complete quietitude
and no sun activity is needed.

00:21:53.487 --> 00:21:57.787
You should not even, when you sleep, there
should not be even a ray of sun.

00:21:57.787 --> 00:22:03.047
Even I, when I sleep I want complete darkness.

00:22:03.047 --> 00:22:08.778
Even a slightest ray of light is coming, which
people know very well, I cannot sleep, because

00:22:08.778 --> 00:22:11.687
I must act.

00:22:11.687 --> 00:22:18.677
So the reaction to this light is so much in
Me, maybe that I’m very sensitive to all

00:22:18.677 --> 00:22:22.987
the elements but what about you?

00:22:22.987 --> 00:22:30.027
You must avoid the sun’s light as much as
you can when you sleep and also should not

00:22:30.027 --> 00:22:32.547
sit in the sun for such a long time.

00:22:32.547 --> 00:22:38.607
Of course sitting in the sun helps you because
it gives you Vitamin D, by which, Vitamin

00:22:38.607 --> 00:22:43.687
D if you take it you build up your bones better
but now I think your bones are quite built,

00:22:43.687 --> 00:22:46.527
there’s no need to build your bones anymore.

00:22:46.527 --> 00:22:53.316
But now by God’s grace you are getting soluble
calciums which you can eat and you can also

00:22:53.316 --> 00:22:56.797
have Vitamin D and A if you want to.

00:22:56.797 --> 00:23:00.087
What is the need of scorching this head?

00:23:00.087 --> 00:23:08.017
Now, if you sit in the sun, then either you
will have a bald head or you will have a jungle

00:23:08.017 --> 00:23:09.017
in the head.

00:23:09.017 --> 00:23:12.307
One of the two thing’s depending on the
personality as you are.

00:23:12.307 --> 00:23:20.177
Because your brain cannot bear it, your skin
cannot bear it.

00:23:20.177 --> 00:23:25.537
After all we are not jungle people are we?

00:23:25.537 --> 00:23:31.077
But you ask any jungle person also, he never
sits in the sun.

00:23:31.077 --> 00:23:40.407
It’s only somebody has cooked it in your
head that you must sit in the sun.

00:23:40.407 --> 00:23:53.227
If you go and see Eskimos who live in the
ice houses, they never bathe in the sun.

00:23:53.227 --> 00:23:56.587
Have you ever seen them sunbathing?

00:23:56.587 --> 00:24:02.797
Have you ever seen them?

00:24:02.797 --> 00:24:06.527
Any picture, anywhere?

00:24:06.527 --> 00:24:13.457
Then why this special type of stupidity is
there among other people because you have

00:24:13.457 --> 00:24:21.617
lost that sense to know that you are maneuvered.

00:24:21.617 --> 00:24:25.957
You see, how to befool you.

00:24:25.957 --> 00:24:31.566
Now you must create some weaknesses for people,
if you don’t create a weakness how will

00:24:31.566 --> 00:24:34.457
they prosper with their machineries?

00:24:34.457 --> 00:24:37.356
So now, let’s befool them.

00:24:37.356 --> 00:24:44.876
If you go to the seashore and you tan your
body, you look very beautiful?

00:24:44.876 --> 00:24:50.837
First of all, you never, you look horrid,
horrid you look and secondly they will say

00:24:50.837 --> 00:24:58.996
that your health will be all right so everybody
is going to the seashore, ending up with a

00:24:58.996 --> 00:25:00.886
skin cancer.

00:25:00.886 --> 00:25:06.247
Because your body revolts against it that’s
why you get skin cancer.

00:25:06.247 --> 00:25:08.256
You get liver troubles, already you are liverish.

00:25:08.256 --> 00:25:14.807
You are already thinking too much, why do
you want to have sun?

00:25:14.807 --> 00:25:19.487
You’ve already too much sun within yourself.

00:25:19.487 --> 00:25:24.167
So what is the reasoning for it?

00:25:24.167 --> 00:25:26.126
I just don’t understand.

00:25:26.126 --> 00:25:32.406
You must know that today we have the work
of the Sahasrara and the Sahasrara is the

00:25:32.406 --> 00:25:34.177
brain.

00:25:34.177 --> 00:25:41.126
We have to work on the brain and if you people
do not know how to use your brain properly,

00:25:41.126 --> 00:25:44.587
I don’t know what am I going to do.

00:25:44.587 --> 00:25:50.417
Moreover today, talking to some Indians, I
discovered some horrifying things which I

00:25:50.417 --> 00:25:58.756
must tell you, which is horrifying as well
as laughed at They were telling Me that if

00:25:58.756 --> 00:26:04.846
you take an English hen and an Indian hen,
there’s a tremendous big difference between

00:26:04.846 --> 00:26:06.067
the two.

00:26:06.067 --> 00:26:13.846
The hen that is Indian, if she sees another
hen being attacked she’ll make such a noise

00:26:13.846 --> 00:26:20.647
that all the hen will join together and will
start making noises so that if there’s an

00:26:20.647 --> 00:26:24.057
attack the master will come and try to remove
the attack.

00:26:24.057 --> 00:26:30.677
But if it’s an English hen, she will just
watch another being eaten up you see and then

00:26:30.677 --> 00:26:33.606
she’s eaten up also, she says, “All right
you eat me, doesn’t matter, I’ll take

00:26:33.606 --> 00:26:35.127
second birth and come back.”

00:26:35.127 --> 00:26:39.896
See they’ve no brains at all.

00:26:39.896 --> 00:26:46.636
You see they have no brains, like say an English
bullock, they have English bullocks also.

00:26:46.636 --> 00:26:50.347
I mean English means Western, they don’t
mean anything else but he’s Australian,

00:26:50.347 --> 00:26:55.616
maybe anything, is English to us because we
had known only English so we say English.

00:26:55.616 --> 00:27:00.636
But that’s what they say English but it
doesn’t mean anything, it means any Westerner

00:27:00.636 --> 00:27:03.106
or any Australian or white skin person.

00:27:03.106 --> 00:27:06.927
A bullock is there, he said, “Our bullocks
if you tell them.

00:27:06.927 --> 00:27:11.016
‘go straight,’ they know; if you tell
them, ‘go left,’ they know; if you tell

00:27:11.016 --> 00:27:14.016
them, ‘walk this way,’ they know;they
know everything.

00:27:14.016 --> 00:27:17.116
But if you have any of these bullocks, they
don’t do anything.

00:27:17.116 --> 00:27:24.077
You tell them go further, you teach them anything,
nothing, they will never learn any thing.

00:27:24.077 --> 00:27:27.337
You tell them, they’ll go the way they want
to go.”

00:27:27.337 --> 00:27:29.437
So very surprising, I said, “Really?”

00:27:29.437 --> 00:27:35.226
“Yes” they said, “It is so, they are
for no good, they can just do what they want

00:27:35.226 --> 00:27:36.736
to do.

00:27:36.736 --> 00:27:40.547
They cannot understand what you’re talking,
they have no understanding about it.”

00:27:40.547 --> 00:27:41.947
Imagine about the bulls.

00:27:41.947 --> 00:27:47.087
And then think of it, in India, you see we
have everything walking on the street, we

00:27:47.087 --> 00:27:51.837
have got the bullocks and we have got the
cows, we’ve got sometimes the hen, everything

00:27:51.837 --> 00:27:52.917
goes on the road.

00:27:52.917 --> 00:27:57.447
They know which side the thing is coming,
which side they have to move, there’s a

00:27:57.447 --> 00:27:58.447
car coming.

00:27:58.447 --> 00:28:04.077
He said, “Put one English cow, they’ll
be all finished on the road.”

00:28:04.077 --> 00:28:09.232
I got such a fright you know when I heard
it.

00:28:09.232 --> 00:28:15.136
I said, “They do not do sunbathing.

00:28:15.136 --> 00:28:19.756
How do they get it?” then I was thinking
that the kind of the food you give them, there

00:28:19.756 --> 00:28:25.477
must be some horrible hormones, they must
be spoiling their brains.

00:28:25.477 --> 00:28:29.697
But we are very destructive, I must tell you.

00:28:29.697 --> 00:28:35.467
Drugs, now we started taking to drugs, in
the name of God.

00:28:35.467 --> 00:28:40.437
I mean Indians, you make them take drugs,
they’ll say tell another, I know what it

00:28:40.437 --> 00:28:41.437
is.

00:28:41.437 --> 00:28:44.156
And then our brains go off with drugs.

00:28:44.156 --> 00:28:49.837
Brains are not normal, why we behave like
this I can only explain that they have taken

00:28:49.837 --> 00:28:54.417
drugs, I’ve seen people who have taken drugs
I just don’t understand why, there’s no

00:28:54.417 --> 00:28:55.417
logic into their behavior.

00:28:55.417 --> 00:29:02.386
Just no logic, they just, like the brains
of a bullock, they behave the same way.

00:29:02.386 --> 00:29:03.487
You just can’t explain why they behave.

00:29:03.487 --> 00:29:04.827
They have taken drugs.

00:29:04.827 --> 00:29:06.727
Now what is drug taking?

00:29:06.727 --> 00:29:07.886
Is again self-destructive.

00:29:07.886 --> 00:29:11.547
Because you want to destroy yourself that’s
why you’ve taken drugs.

00:29:11.547 --> 00:29:15.286
Otherwise how many Indians you have known
who take drugs?

00:29:15.286 --> 00:29:26.167
I’ve never even seen them.

00:29:26.167 --> 00:29:35.406
And another thing, Dhumal told Me, I mean
he says his reading is he says that if a child

00:29:35.406 --> 00:29:39.786
is educated in a vernacular school, I was
also educated in a vernacular school because

00:29:39.786 --> 00:29:43.707
My father was very particular, “Nothing
doing, no English schools.”

00:29:43.707 --> 00:29:48.486
And those who are educated in the English
schools, there’s such a difference, he say’s

00:29:48.486 --> 00:29:52.947
he has his children educated in the English
school and he has his children educated in

00:29:52.947 --> 00:29:54.117
a vernacular school.

00:29:54.117 --> 00:29:56.016
The youngest one is in the vernacular school.

00:29:56.016 --> 00:29:58.256
He says he knows about everything.

00:29:58.256 --> 00:30:06.266
He’ll know how many cows are in the house,
he will look after parrots, he knows how the

00:30:06.266 --> 00:30:09.587
parrot works out, how the things are, he’s
the youngest.

00:30:09.587 --> 00:30:14.516
He knows about everything but other children
they just will stand.

00:30:14.516 --> 00:30:20.577
If you tell them, they’ll give an explanation
and then they say, “So what?

00:30:20.577 --> 00:30:21.577
So what?”

00:30:21.577 --> 00:30:26.786
But if you tell him something, immediately
he will know what is to be done, he’ll just

00:30:26.786 --> 00:30:33.596
get it done the way he wants to do it, in
the sense that it must be done.

00:30:33.596 --> 00:30:35.127
But here the other way round.

00:30:35.127 --> 00:30:40.307
If you tell a child from an English school,
he will do the way he wants to do and if you

00:30:40.307 --> 00:30:45.276
tell him, “Why did you do this way?” he’ll
say, “What’s wrong?” or at the most

00:30:45.276 --> 00:30:46.517
he’ll say, “I’m sorry.”

00:30:46.517 --> 00:30:47.517
Finished.

00:30:47.517 --> 00:30:50.417
I mean like Sahaja Yogis will pull their ears,
finished.

00:30:50.417 --> 00:30:55.057
Even if he hit’s you, he’ll say, “Pull
my ear’s Mother, I’ve hit You.”

00:30:55.057 --> 00:30:56.167
It’s like that.

00:30:56.167 --> 00:30:59.917
It’s very funny thing, I said what’s wrong
with the language?

00:30:59.917 --> 00:31:04.136
Why this English language makes people like
that?

00:31:04.136 --> 00:31:05.136
I can’t understand.

00:31:05.136 --> 00:31:06.136
Why?

00:31:06.136 --> 00:31:08.486
I just didn’t understand.

00:31:08.486 --> 00:31:10.896
“What’s wrong?”

00:31:10.896 --> 00:31:16.016
Now this is not in any Indian language, you
see if you say, they’ll say, “What?

00:31:16.016 --> 00:31:19.906
We didn’t understand, what are you saying,
‘What’s wrong?’”

00:31:19.906 --> 00:31:27.146
I mean just, the whole, I think the language
itself has the disciplining in-built, it’s

00:31:27.146 --> 00:31:36.307
a what you call Mardav, it builds up the personality.

00:31:36.307 --> 00:31:40.406
Like if somebody tries to show off.

00:31:40.406 --> 00:31:43.136
You see, immediately we’ll say, “You are
over wise.”

00:31:43.136 --> 00:31:44.376
Ati Shahane.

00:31:44.376 --> 00:31:46.927
And the saying is, “Ati Shahane tyanche
baila rikame.”

00:31:46.927 --> 00:31:54.906
Those who try to show that they are very intelligent,
their bullocks have no work, means they’re

00:31:54.906 --> 00:31:56.136
lazy lumps.

00:31:56.136 --> 00:31:59.836
The whole language system is such.

00:31:59.836 --> 00:32:05.386
They’re so practical I tell you, they’re
so practical.

00:32:05.386 --> 00:32:11.447
And that is why, we came to India first of
all, we had some Sahaja Yogis with us when

00:32:11.447 --> 00:32:18.807
we came here about twenty-five Sahaja Yogis
from England came and we all stayed here and

00:32:18.807 --> 00:32:23.707
all these people looked after them and they
fed them and of course I mean, they had paid

00:32:23.707 --> 00:32:26.136
no money, nothing they lived there.

00:32:26.136 --> 00:32:31.636
Nobody even wrote a letter of thanks so they
all got worried and they wrote a letter to

00:32:31.636 --> 00:32:36.107
Me saying that Mother what has happened, are
they all right or are they sick?

00:32:36.107 --> 00:32:38.396
They have not written any letter to us.

00:32:38.396 --> 00:32:42.276
So I called them, I said, “Did you write
any letters to them?”

00:32:42.276 --> 00:32:43.276
“No”.

00:32:43.276 --> 00:32:44.276
I said, “Why?”

00:32:44.276 --> 00:32:46.477
“We know, we know, we did wrong, we know.”

00:32:46.477 --> 00:32:49.156
“You know, then why did you not do it?”

00:32:49.156 --> 00:32:53.036
“No but we know.”

00:32:53.036 --> 00:32:58.656
Now what is an argument here?

00:32:58.656 --> 00:33:03.636
Now you have come out of that, what I’m
giving you, the background.

00:33:03.636 --> 00:33:12.057
You have come out of it, now you are Sahaja
Yogis, you are saints, so you have to be very

00:33:12.057 --> 00:33:13.057
different.

00:33:13.057 --> 00:33:20.756
You can’t be like them.

00:33:20.756 --> 00:33:23.406
You have to understand.

00:33:23.406 --> 00:33:29.707
Like some people have a habit of saying, “Ah,
Mother I’m so badly off.”

00:33:29.707 --> 00:33:30.707
You ask them, “How are you?”

00:33:30.707 --> 00:33:34.096
They’ll say [SHRI MATAJI SWAYS HER HAND
INDICATING ‘SO-SO’] like this, it’s

00:33:34.096 --> 00:33:38.457
very common, so I look at their hands, what’s
it?

00:33:38.457 --> 00:33:39.717
I don’t understand.

00:33:39.717 --> 00:33:41.607
What does that [SHRI MATAJI SWAYS HER HAND
INDICATING ‘SO-SO’] mean?

00:33:41.607 --> 00:33:44.447
Here people will feel ashamed to say.

00:33:44.447 --> 00:33:48.317
Even if you are sick, even if you are dying.

00:33:48.317 --> 00:33:49.317
If somebody will ask, “How are you?”

00:33:49.317 --> 00:33:50.317
They will say, “I’m all right.

00:33:50.317 --> 00:33:51.317
I’m all right.”

00:33:51.317 --> 00:34:01.996
Nobody will do like this [SHRI MATAJI SWAYS
HER HAND INDICATING ‘SO-SO’] Means what?

00:34:01.996 --> 00:34:04.536
You ask them “What’s your name?”

00:34:04.536 --> 00:34:05.917
“Did you ask my name?”

00:34:05.917 --> 00:34:09.937
“Of course I did, but why do you ask Me
again?”

00:34:09.937 --> 00:34:15.177
Any question you ask, they will repeat it,
always.

00:34:15.177 --> 00:34:16.957
I used to wonder why do they repeat?

00:34:16.957 --> 00:34:20.106
And they didn’t get it in their heads or
what?

00:34:20.106 --> 00:34:25.096
Now the thing is, that is what is the background
of this brain and don’t spoil it more by

00:34:25.096 --> 00:34:27.526
this sun.

00:34:27.526 --> 00:34:37.496
You have to do work of this Sahasrara, Sahasrara
which is the lotus, lotus of the Divine which

00:34:37.496 --> 00:34:42.667
has got beautiful petals now enlightened by
your Kundalini.

00:34:42.667 --> 00:34:47.917
They are the living petals, do not try to
play with it.

00:34:47.917 --> 00:34:53.447
That’s why I say, don’t read funny books,
don’t see funny things, don’t talk to

00:34:53.447 --> 00:34:59.677
funny people, don’t waste your energy in
worrying, in futuristic attitude, keep to

00:34:59.677 --> 00:35:00.677
yourself.

00:35:00.677 --> 00:35:07.667
Let this [SHRI MATAJI PUTS HER HAND ON HER
HEAD] grow because the roots are in the brain.

00:35:07.667 --> 00:35:16.167
The tree of awareness grows downward but the
roots are in the brain and you have to go

00:35:16.167 --> 00:35:22.427
to the roots now because you have done that
movement now you come back and for that you

00:35:22.427 --> 00:35:25.447
have to know to look after your brain.

00:35:25.447 --> 00:35:35.367
The other day I also said that I don’t know
why you people don’t put any oil whatsoever.

00:35:35.367 --> 00:35:41.276
Why not put oil in the head, poor head needs
the oil always, at least on a Saturday, put

00:35:41.276 --> 00:35:45.656
so much oil, rub it nicely and have a bath.

00:35:45.656 --> 00:35:48.366
But people just don’t put any oil in their
head.

00:35:48.366 --> 00:35:53.616
I mean you must oil, gear up your brain, don’t
you think so?

00:35:53.616 --> 00:36:00.587
If you don’t put oil in any machine, it
will crack.

00:36:00.587 --> 00:36:07.136
For this brain which is your special machine
after Sahaja Yoga is really a very special

00:36:07.136 --> 00:36:14.937
one, you must try to put lot of oil in it.

00:36:14.937 --> 00:36:20.516
Put some oil in the ears, put some oil in
the nose.

00:36:20.516 --> 00:36:26.786
Now the modern theory of the doctors is don’t
put any oil or anything into the ears and

00:36:26.786 --> 00:36:29.846
the noses of the children.

00:36:29.846 --> 00:36:36.476
Rajesh’s brother had a child and they went
to of course to a latest Doctor from America.

00:36:36.476 --> 00:36:44.677
And the child was crying, weeping, feeling
so horrible and his Brahmarandra, what you

00:36:44.677 --> 00:36:48.947
call, the fontanel bone area was not filled
at all, it was all open.

00:36:48.947 --> 00:36:51.187
I said, “What’s the matter with you people?”

00:36:51.187 --> 00:36:53.896
They said the doctor has said, “Don’t
touch the oil.”

00:36:53.896 --> 00:36:54.896
I said, “What?”

00:36:54.896 --> 00:36:57.807
They said, “He’ll have allergy”.

00:36:57.807 --> 00:37:01.577
I said, “Nothing of the kind, you bring
the oil.”

00:37:01.577 --> 00:37:06.726
I got one full katori [KATORI MEANS BOWL IN
HINDI] of oil, rubbed it on his head, pushed

00:37:06.726 --> 00:37:11.406
back that thing and I put it in nose, in ears,
the child slept like a log of wood.

00:37:11.406 --> 00:37:15.776
Imagine how much the child must have suffered?

00:37:15.776 --> 00:37:18.036
These stupid ideas come from where?

00:37:18.036 --> 00:37:23.557
I don’t know, they don’t have any oil
these days, so what is their idea is to do,

00:37:23.557 --> 00:37:26.626
some business must be behind it, I don’t
know what is going on.

00:37:26.626 --> 00:37:30.677
I don’t know what they are going to run
by not giving any oil to the children.

00:37:30.677 --> 00:37:35.457
They must be having some business with that
also.

00:37:35.457 --> 00:37:37.937
Otherwise it is absolutely a stupid idea.

00:37:37.937 --> 00:37:41.156
I just don’t understand that the child has
an allergy.

00:37:41.156 --> 00:37:46.947
But how presumptuous to think like that!

00:37:46.947 --> 00:37:50.776
Now why the child has an allergy.

00:37:50.776 --> 00:37:52.937
Now let Me ask a question.

00:37:52.937 --> 00:38:01.236
Why a child will have an allergy?

00:38:01.236 --> 00:38:09.966
The doctors have to answer.

00:38:09.966 --> 00:38:19.947
Or, of course you are all doctors so you should
say.

00:38:19.947 --> 00:38:20.947
Can I have the answer?

00:38:20.947 --> 00:38:21.947
Yogi: It could be an imbalance of heat and
cold in the body?

00:38:21.947 --> 00:38:22.947
Shri Mataji: But why?

00:38:22.947 --> 00:38:23.947
Say on the chakras.

00:38:23.947 --> 00:38:39.417
You say on the chakras what will be catching.

00:38:39.417 --> 00:38:42.496
If somebody has allergies, what does it catch?

00:38:42.496 --> 00:38:44.417
Yogi: The Left Nabhi.

00:38:44.417 --> 00:38:45.866
Shri Mataji: Correct.

00:38:45.866 --> 00:38:46.866
Left Nabhi.

00:38:46.866 --> 00:38:49.427
Left Nabhi will catch.

00:38:49.427 --> 00:38:54.626
Now that means the mother.

00:38:54.626 --> 00:38:58.297
Because the child is not yet married so it’s
the mother.

00:38:58.297 --> 00:39:05.817
That means mother must be having a left Nabhi
herself and that’s why the child must catching

00:39:05.817 --> 00:39:12.706
with that allergy, so instead of punishing
the child, why not cure the left Nabhi of

00:39:12.706 --> 00:39:17.226
the mother and left Nabhi of the child?

00:39:17.226 --> 00:39:21.236
Now what will you do if there’s a left Nabhi
of the child?

00:39:21.236 --> 00:39:46.786
What we can do to help the child to get rid
of it?

00:39:46.786 --> 00:39:52.536
Ah, very simple.

00:39:52.536 --> 00:39:57.307
Anything that is left can be taken out on
the little flame.

00:39:57.307 --> 00:40:03.917
Put your right hand on the left Nabhi of the
child and put your left hand to the flame

00:40:03.917 --> 00:40:08.067
and finished.

00:40:08.067 --> 00:40:14.557
Now in diagnosis you are easy but now for
medicines, now remember the certain principles

00:40:14.557 --> 00:40:16.697
of medicines.

00:40:16.697 --> 00:40:19.687
Very certain principles are there.

00:40:19.687 --> 00:40:27.606
If it is left side, you have take it to the
fire or to the sun or to the flames, all right?

00:40:27.606 --> 00:40:32.156
If it is a left side [could Shri Mataji have
meant “right”?] you have take it to the

00:40:32.156 --> 00:40:33.156
water in general.

00:40:33.156 --> 00:40:42.947
Any body suffering from right side, put him
in the water, finished.

00:40:42.947 --> 00:40:44.007
Done.

00:40:44.007 --> 00:40:46.067
Not in the sun of course.

00:40:46.067 --> 00:40:57.116
Any disease, you bring it to this point.

00:40:57.116 --> 00:41:01.266
It’s very simple.

00:41:01.266 --> 00:41:02.937
Now let Me have some questions about certain
diseases.

00:41:02.937 --> 00:41:06.187
Yogi: They’ve been asking Me for the last
three weeks.

00:41:06.187 --> 00:41:09.136
Shri Mataji: Huh?

00:41:09.136 --> 00:41:22.227
Yogi: They’ve been asking Me for the last
three weeks, so they must have it.

00:41:22.227 --> 00:41:26.367
Shri Mataji: All right let’s have it, I
will see if I can answer.

00:41:26.367 --> 00:41:27.367
Yes.

00:41:27.367 --> 00:41:29.607
Yogi: Psoriasis, Mother?

00:41:29.607 --> 00:41:32.027
Shri Mataji: Huh?

00:41:32.027 --> 00:41:33.647
Yogi: Psoriasis.

00:41:33.647 --> 00:41:36.887
Shri Mataji: Same thing.

00:41:36.887 --> 00:41:40.527
Psoriasis is nothing else but left side problem.

00:41:40.527 --> 00:41:43.047
Is a lethargic liver.

00:41:43.047 --> 00:41:47.157
And gives you allergies.

00:41:47.157 --> 00:41:55.977
For psoriasis, left hand towards the photograph
and right hand on the Mother Earth.

00:41:55.977 --> 00:42:03.027
Putting hot water bottle on the stomach.

00:42:03.027 --> 00:42:21.747
Or even giving bandhan to your liver with
the light is all right.

00:42:21.747 --> 00:42:25.957
You must see, because psoriasis, now people
might think psoriasis means active liver or

00:42:25.957 --> 00:42:29.527
inactive liver, you see it comes to that point.

00:42:29.527 --> 00:42:32.257
But we have only two types: active or inactive.

00:42:32.257 --> 00:42:36.167
Now whether psoriasis is inactive or active
you will know from one point that when the

00:42:36.167 --> 00:42:43.697
liver is inactive you get the allergies, and
when it is active you get other problems like

00:42:43.697 --> 00:42:55.887
what you call that in English, I don’t know,
nausea and also you get biliousness.

00:42:55.887 --> 00:43:01.707
You don’t eat much, you thin down all these
problems are there.

00:43:01.707 --> 00:43:02.847
Now what else?

00:43:02.847 --> 00:43:04.547
Yogi: Eczema?

00:43:04.547 --> 00:43:09.647
Shri Mataji: For eczema same thing.

00:43:09.647 --> 00:43:18.747
Eczema is the same thing, is just like allergy,
eczema same thing.

00:43:18.747 --> 00:43:23.147
But for eczema because it’s outward you
can use certain things like neem ka pata and

00:43:23.147 --> 00:43:26.557
all that I’ve told you and so many things
can be used on top.

00:43:26.557 --> 00:43:29.147
Yogi: Fungus?

00:43:29.147 --> 00:43:36.907
Shri Mataji: Fungus, outside or inside?

00:43:36.907 --> 00:43:39.597
Yogi: On the skin.

00:43:39.597 --> 00:43:41.857
Shri Mataji: Is one of the worst thing is
fungus.

00:43:41.857 --> 00:43:47.437
Same thing, but it’s the worst thing I should
say that it’s the left side again is the

00:43:47.437 --> 00:43:52.557
attack is the left side fungus is all dead
and you have to use the left side towards

00:43:52.557 --> 00:43:56.217
the photograph and right hand on the places
wherever you have the fungus, you may take

00:43:56.217 --> 00:44:02.577
it out that way but don’t eat cheese, and
the fungousy cheese you are not supposed to

00:44:02.577 --> 00:44:03.887
eat at all.

00:44:03.887 --> 00:44:07.587
All the Sahaja Yogis should not eat any fungousy
cheese.

00:44:07.587 --> 00:44:17.607
That blue one, with a crust one, all fungus
must to avoided, and also mushrooms if possible.

00:44:17.607 --> 00:44:27.007
Yogi: Why does cow’s milk make allergies
and eczema worse?

00:44:27.007 --> 00:44:30.777
Shri Mataji: What is…?

00:44:30.777 --> 00:44:40.177
Yogi: Why does cow’s milk make allergies
and eczema worse?

00:44:40.177 --> 00:44:43.947
Shri Mataji: Cow’s milk..

00:44:43.947 --> 00:44:47.137
Yogi: Because it’s left side?

00:44:47.137 --> 00:44:48.647
Shri Mataji: Left side.

00:44:48.647 --> 00:44:53.777
Cow’s milk always give you the left side
because she’s the mother, and you should

00:44:53.777 --> 00:44:58.767
not have her milk, because it’s left sided.

00:44:58.767 --> 00:45:03.828
Whether it is cow’s milk or buffalo’s
milk, all will give allergies but if you have

00:45:03.828 --> 00:45:12.357
animals which are smaller than you like if
you can drink like Mahatma Gandhi the goat’s

00:45:12.357 --> 00:45:31.437
milk then you might not have the problem.

00:45:31.437 --> 00:45:32.487
Yogi: We do completely around..

00:45:32.487 --> 00:45:33.957
When we have diarrhea we drink milk.

00:45:33.957 --> 00:45:35.227
Shri Mataji: Diarrhea you drink milk?

00:45:35.227 --> 00:45:39.977
The amount of salads you eat, sometimes I
think this fodder will make us like buffalos

00:45:39.977 --> 00:45:41.977
or what?

00:45:41.977 --> 00:45:49.957
I just can’t touch them I tell you.

00:45:49.957 --> 00:46:00.937
But I have to eat just to show that I appreciate.

00:46:00.937 --> 00:46:02.337
Yogi: Bronchial Asthma.

00:46:02.337 --> 00:46:06.057
Shri Mataji: Bronchial asthma is caused by
the combination of the right heart and the

00:46:06.057 --> 00:46:07.217
left heart.

00:46:07.217 --> 00:46:17.107
If the parents have been quarreling too much,
if they are divorced, if you never had the

00:46:17.107 --> 00:46:23.417
security of the parent’s love, then you
get bronchial asthma, but if it is another

00:46:23.417 --> 00:46:30.637
one just superficial one then it could be
from the father’s death or from the fatherhood

00:46:30.637 --> 00:46:36.817
suffering but if father and motherhood both
have made you insecure or if both of them

00:46:36.817 --> 00:46:42.197
have died then you get bronchial asthma.

00:46:42.197 --> 00:46:44.097
Is a combination.

00:46:44.097 --> 00:46:45.947
Yogi: Hypoglycemia.

00:46:45.947 --> 00:46:49.657
Shri Mataji: What’s that?

00:46:49.657 --> 00:46:53.367
Yogi: Low blood level.

00:46:53.367 --> 00:46:54.367
Hypo-glycemia.

00:46:54.367 --> 00:46:57.997
Shri Mataji: I know.

00:46:57.997 --> 00:47:00.787
Low blood level.

00:47:00.787 --> 00:47:04.787
That comes from over activity.

00:47:04.787 --> 00:47:08.297
You should not think so much.

00:47:08.297 --> 00:47:09.297
Agnya.

00:47:09.297 --> 00:47:11.727
Too much of Agyna.

00:47:11.727 --> 00:47:13.097
Agnya chakra.

00:47:13.097 --> 00:47:15.837
Too much of agnya.

00:47:15.837 --> 00:47:24.557
Surrender yourself to Christ, absolutely surrender
yourself to Christ, it will work out.

00:47:24.557 --> 00:47:26.097
Yogi: Spondylitis.

00:47:26.097 --> 00:47:30.687
Shri Mataji: Spondylitis is left Vishuddhi.

00:47:30.687 --> 00:47:35.287
And right Vishuddhi could be also.

00:47:35.287 --> 00:47:38.497
But mostly left Vishuddhi Spondylitis.

00:47:38.497 --> 00:47:40.767
Combination also could be.

00:47:40.767 --> 00:47:44.307
Yogi: Multiple Sclerosis.

00:47:44.307 --> 00:47:53.727
Shri Mataji: Multiple Sclerosis is comes from
Mooladhara.

00:47:53.727 --> 00:47:57.257
Mooladhara and Nabhi.

00:47:57.257 --> 00:48:01.967
Left Nabhi and Mooladhara.

00:48:01.967 --> 00:48:05.687
It’s more left sided.

00:48:05.687 --> 00:48:08.637
Give the treatment of the left side.

00:48:08.637 --> 00:48:12.717
Saying the name of Ganesha and of Gauri.

00:48:12.717 --> 00:48:15.577
It will work out.

00:48:15.577 --> 00:48:18.437
Yogi: Varicose veins Mother.

00:48:18.437 --> 00:48:20.577
Shri Mataji: Huh?

00:48:20.577 --> 00:48:22.717
Yogi: Varicose veins.

00:48:22.717 --> 00:48:30.337
Shri Mataji: It comes from the people who
stand too much all the time and they work

00:48:30.337 --> 00:48:31.507
very hard.

00:48:31.507 --> 00:48:38.627
As soon as it starts it’s better to cure
them, you have to lie down everyday.

00:48:38.627 --> 00:48:45.317
Those who stand everyday for more than say
three-four hours should lie down on bed and

00:48:45.317 --> 00:48:46.317
do cycling.

00:48:46.317 --> 00:48:49.527
[SHRI MATAJI MAKES CYCLING MOVEMENTS WITH
HER HANDS].

00:48:49.527 --> 00:48:53.307
Everyday, that will help reduce the weight
maybe due to weight also.

00:48:53.307 --> 00:49:02.737
Some people have weight, but those who stand,
I’ve seen those who stand for a long time

00:49:02.737 --> 00:49:08.957
without the heels, if you use the heels you
might be better off.

00:49:08.957 --> 00:49:15.627
With the heels the pressure is not so much
then it is distributed more to the lower of

00:49:15.627 --> 00:49:19.207
those five chakras down below that might help.

00:49:19.207 --> 00:49:25.257
But, best is to do exercise after you have
stood for a long time just lie down in the

00:49:25.257 --> 00:49:32.357
bed and do cycling, and also massaging, slowly
massaging it downward.

00:49:32.357 --> 00:49:42.707
Also it can work out with the ice treatment,
you can put some ice before massaging you

00:49:42.707 --> 00:49:54.677
can put the ice on them and use very cold
oil and rub it, it will work out.

00:49:54.677 --> 00:49:55.787
Yogi: Flu?

00:49:55.787 --> 00:49:56.787
Flu?

00:49:56.787 --> 00:50:00.257
Shri Mataji: That’s one thing is difficult.

00:50:00.257 --> 00:50:01.467
Flu.

00:50:01.467 --> 00:50:08.707
Now for flu, first of all this is again left-sided.

00:50:08.707 --> 00:50:14.527
But we have got a very good medicine in India
I don’t know if you have that there is what

00:50:14.527 --> 00:50:19.057
you call is the basil [IN HINDI IT IS CALLED
TULSI].

00:50:19.057 --> 00:50:24.307
Basil leaves, you take lots of basil leaves
make a concoction, it’s called?

00:50:24.307 --> 00:50:25.307
Yogi: Infusion.

00:50:25.307 --> 00:50:26.427
Shri Mataji: Huh?

00:50:26.427 --> 00:50:27.427
Yogi: Infusion.

00:50:27.427 --> 00:50:28.557
Shri Mataji: No.

00:50:28.557 --> 00:50:31.527
Yogi: Boil it up in a pot.

00:50:31.527 --> 00:50:37.207
Shri Mataji: Boil it up in a pot, make it
absolutely, the essence take it out quite

00:50:37.207 --> 00:50:42.177
thick put tea in it or wateror just like the
way you want to make it like a tea and put

00:50:42.177 --> 00:50:49.127
milk or whichever way you want but less milk
and sugar because the taste may not be so

00:50:49.127 --> 00:50:50.127
good.

00:50:50.127 --> 00:50:55.137
And then you drink it, before that you have
to prepare some what you call for dhuni?

00:50:55.137 --> 00:50:59.827
You all know ajwain ka dhuni.

00:50:59.827 --> 00:51:03.807
You see you know that.

00:51:03.807 --> 00:51:13.997
So you take ajwain ka dhuni after that, that’s
all.

00:51:13.997 --> 00:51:25.197
You do it three days you’ll be all right,
cleared out.

00:51:25.197 --> 00:51:30.287
Yogi: Shri Mataji, psychosomatic diseases…?

00:51:30.287 --> 00:51:33.347
Shri Mataji: What?

00:51:33.347 --> 00:51:45.567
Yogi: He’s saying psychosomatic diseases
in particular, nervous break down comes from

00:51:45.567 --> 00:51:46.587
where?

00:51:46.587 --> 00:51:48.457
Right side or left side?

00:51:48.457 --> 00:51:51.567
Shri Mataji: You see it’s a very funny word
psychosomatic means it’s also psycho and

00:51:51.567 --> 00:51:55.057
it’s also somatic, so I don’t know which
one it is, if you say psycho somatic or somatic

00:51:55.057 --> 00:51:56.057
psycho.

00:51:56.057 --> 00:51:57.057
Yogi: You mean psychological diseases?

00:51:57.057 --> 00:51:58.057
Shri Mataji: Nehi, nehi.

00:51:58.057 --> 00:51:59.057
Psychosomatic is nervousness you see.

00:51:59.057 --> 00:52:02.347
Nervousness can be caused by bad habits.

00:52:02.347 --> 00:52:04.607
How?

00:52:04.607 --> 00:52:10.597
Like if you are an air hostess you form a
bad habit, as soon as you see the airport

00:52:10.597 --> 00:52:13.937
[SHRI MATAJI MOVES HER HAND AROUND HER STOMACH
INDICATING NERVOUSNESS].

00:52:13.937 --> 00:52:15.937
Now those who travel too much.

00:52:15.937 --> 00:52:19.767
As soon as they have to travel they go off
their heads.

00:52:19.767 --> 00:52:25.778
Over doing anything, you see, you get nervous
feeling, it’s a matter of habit, you form

00:52:25.778 --> 00:52:28.037
that habit so it happens.

00:52:28.037 --> 00:52:34.307
So, I will not say it is due to some bhadha
or anything, but your nerves are too much

00:52:34.307 --> 00:52:36.177
used in a particular way.

00:52:36.177 --> 00:52:39.557
Then they just give in, they cannot work it
out anymore.

00:52:39.557 --> 00:52:42.357
So then you must change that habit.

00:52:42.357 --> 00:52:49.937
Supposing you are traveling too much by plane,
then travel by a ship, or travel by a train,

00:52:49.937 --> 00:52:53.927
or by a bullock cart.

00:52:53.927 --> 00:53:02.437
Or don’t travel, something like that, anything
that you over do too much that forms a kind

00:53:02.437 --> 00:53:04.517
of a strain on your nerves.

00:53:04.517 --> 00:53:09.487
So try to reduce that strain on your nerves.

00:53:09.487 --> 00:53:16.297
Yogi: You recommended heels, what height?

00:53:16.297 --> 00:53:27.307
Shri Mataji: No, no I didn’t say for all
of you.

00:53:27.307 --> 00:53:29.887
I said for varicose veins.

00:53:29.887 --> 00:53:32.087
Or specially for people who develop problems
on the heels.

00:53:32.087 --> 00:53:39.757
There’s no height you just try whatever
you can say about one inch will do from one

00:53:39.757 --> 00:53:47.497
inch onward, anything, not too much one inch
or lower, but you see if you develop some

00:53:47.497 --> 00:53:56.377
sort of a bone on your heels or something
like that for that the heels are always better.

00:53:56.377 --> 00:53:59.967
Little heels are better.

00:53:59.967 --> 00:54:00.967
Baldness.

00:54:00.967 --> 00:54:04.447
It’s not a disease.

00:54:04.447 --> 00:54:10.727
But it comes out of many habits.

00:54:10.727 --> 00:54:13.497
One of them is wearing the hat.

00:54:13.497 --> 00:54:20.637
If you wear the hat too tight then the circulation
of the brain is spoiled and that’s when

00:54:20.637 --> 00:54:22.287
you might get one.

00:54:22.287 --> 00:54:30.127
Then also with the left Nabhi you might develop
a back bald head here if you have a left Nabhi

00:54:30.127 --> 00:54:35.597
then their’s no circulation, it works out
that way.

00:54:35.597 --> 00:54:46.037
And they say that if somebody has a bald head
he will get some money, he’s a moneyed man,

00:54:46.037 --> 00:54:47.037
in India.

00:54:47.037 --> 00:54:56.867
I don’t know why we believe in such a thing,
but we believe that if you have a bald head

00:54:56.867 --> 00:55:01.607
means he’s a moneyed man, you see, the one
who does not have a bald head is not a moneyed

00:55:01.607 --> 00:55:08.547
man, who doesn’t have a belly is not a dignified
man, according to Indian standards.

00:55:08.547 --> 00:55:12.137
But bald head is caused by not using oil.

00:55:12.137 --> 00:55:16.377
Or, by not using proper oil.

00:55:16.377 --> 00:55:26.017
Oil should be used properly and the skull
must be actually the skull must be rubbed

00:55:26.017 --> 00:55:33.437
not the skin so that if you rub it the skin
must move on the skull and then you won’t

00:55:33.437 --> 00:55:34.587
have this problem.

00:55:34.587 --> 00:55:41.437
Another is that if you use funny type of oils
with lots of fragrance and essences in it

00:55:41.437 --> 00:55:43.467
then you might get grey hair.

00:55:43.467 --> 00:55:51.107
And also ghee should never be used for rubbing
in the head but you can use it for the body

00:55:51.107 --> 00:56:00.488
is good ghee or even the butter is good if
you are overactive, then, otherwise not, but

00:56:00.488 --> 00:56:07.337
ghee should never be used or butter should
never be used for the hair.

00:56:07.337 --> 00:56:10.817
Now you have two types of bald heads, as I
told you.

00:56:10.817 --> 00:56:13.417
Some who start from here and some who start
from there.

00:56:13.417 --> 00:56:14.907
[SHRI MATAJI POINTS TO THE FRONT OF HER HEAD
AND THEN TO THE BACK].

00:56:14.907 --> 00:56:17.467
It’s a very interesting subject.

00:56:17.467 --> 00:56:18.997
[YOGIS LAUGH TOO].

00:56:18.997 --> 00:56:22.767
And, those who have both, could be.

00:56:22.767 --> 00:56:30.717
Now I would say the one which starts from
here [SHRI MATAJI POINTS TO THE FRONT OF THE

00:56:30.717 --> 00:56:38.497
HEAD] are the people who are the ones who
have got an Ekadesha problem also possibly.

00:56:38.497 --> 00:56:44.037
With the Ekadesha problem it starts or who
are not very collective or something, it will

00:56:44.037 --> 00:56:45.257
start receding back.

00:56:45.257 --> 00:56:52.757
All right, those who start from here [SHRI
MATAJI POINTS TO THE BACK OF THE HEAD] are

00:56:52.757 --> 00:56:59.657
the people who may not be good husbands, maybe
something wrong with their wives, maybe bad

00:56:59.657 --> 00:57:06.007
wives, the husband-wife relationship is upsetting
then also this starts at the back or maybe

00:57:06.007 --> 00:57:12.617
there’s some incompatibility between the
two or too much attachment to the wife or

00:57:12.617 --> 00:57:17.097
too much attachment to the husband also you
start developing like that.

00:57:17.097 --> 00:57:22.347
All these things are left Nabhi, so the left
Nabhi relationship you know is the Gruha Lakshmi

00:57:22.347 --> 00:57:28.207
relationship, where you adore your wife so
much that she’s no more a Gruha Lakshmi

00:57:28.207 --> 00:57:32.537
also is a wrong thing, these things start
with that.

00:57:32.537 --> 00:57:38.407
And also could be, also could be with your
hectic life, if you are very hectic in your

00:57:38.407 --> 00:57:43.587
life running up and down doing too much work
also it may start, you don’t listen to your

00:57:43.587 --> 00:57:48.177
wife about it and you think you have to do
this work then also it might start it there

00:57:48.177 --> 00:57:51.927
are so many reasons for the left Nabhi to
start, but the one that starts here [SHRI

00:57:51.927 --> 00:57:54.787
MATAJI POINTS TO HER FOREHEAD AREA] starts
with the right Nabhi or we can say with the

00:57:54.787 --> 00:57:57.287
Ekadesha more on this side.

00:57:57.287 --> 00:58:01.877
So I don’t know in your case, Johan, what
should I blame.

00:58:01.877 --> 00:58:09.727
I would say is a complete neglect, complete
neglect of your hair, no oiling at all that’s

00:58:09.727 --> 00:58:16.377
what it is, I mean if you do not give water
to the plant it will die and then if you say

00:58:16.377 --> 00:58:19.647
why is it caused, I mean if you don’t give
it water it’s the one that it eats, drinks

00:58:19.647 --> 00:58:22.497
and lives on so oil is the one on which the
hair reside.

00:58:22.497 --> 00:58:31.537
Yogi: In the west we get pain in the knees
when we sit on the ground, is there anyway

00:58:31.537 --> 00:58:42.197
of avoiding it?

00:58:42.197 --> 00:58:50.787
Shri Mataji: You see it is due to the Nabhi
you have.

00:58:50.787 --> 00:58:55.857
Right or the left and no practice of sitting
down.

00:58:55.857 --> 00:59:03.107
Now what you have to do that you have to learn
a certain what you call an exercise.

00:59:03.107 --> 00:59:07.427
I’ve told people what is the exercise needed
for it then you’ll get used to it you’ll

00:59:07.427 --> 00:59:11.017
start sitting on the ground all right without
feeling the pain on the knees.

00:59:11.017 --> 00:59:15.347
It will help you in the long run very much.

00:59:15.347 --> 00:59:18.397
There are certain exercises to be done.

00:59:18.397 --> 00:59:23.897
But at least your children you make them sit
on the ground from now so that there’s no

00:59:23.897 --> 00:59:24.897
problem for them.

00:59:24.897 --> 00:59:32.697
Yogi: I noticed that a lot of ladies…

00:59:32.697 --> 00:59:38.687
Shri Mataji: Here?

00:59:38.687 --> 00:59:40.717
In the West?

00:59:40.717 --> 00:59:50.417
Yogi: When I came to Paris, I noticed a lot
of ladies after sixty years old began to lose

00:59:50.417 --> 00:59:51.417
hair.

00:59:51.417 --> 00:59:55.107
Shri Mataji: But sixty years one should have
that otherwise they don’t look all right,

00:59:55.107 --> 01:00:00.887
you see, in sixty years you should look like
a sixty year old, you see, otherwise it’s

01:00:00.887 --> 01:00:01.887
very embarrassing.

01:00:01.887 --> 01:00:06.597
For Me I must say I must also get some bald
head and some wrinkles and this and that.

01:00:06.597 --> 01:00:11.317
Because, you see, once we were traveling and
we had some lady with us she’s six years

01:00:11.317 --> 01:00:15.967
younger to Me and Modi was all the time trying
to help her, poor old lady, poor old lady,

01:00:15.967 --> 01:00:21.187
I said what’s this nonsense, she’s six
years, younger to Me and you are just trying

01:00:21.187 --> 01:00:23.097
to help her all the time.

01:00:23.097 --> 01:00:24.837
What about Me?

01:00:24.837 --> 01:00:30.777
Nobody’s bothered, they make Me sit for
hours together, they do this, do that.

01:00:30.777 --> 01:00:40.477
Supposing if I looked old, you would have
said, “No, no Mother, you must be tired.”

01:00:40.477 --> 01:00:45.707
Now the ladies develop that because they might
be dominating women – possibly, or maybe

01:00:45.707 --> 01:00:48.677
they are neglecting their hair.

01:00:48.677 --> 01:00:50.447
Yogi: Or drunkenness.

01:00:50.447 --> 01:00:52.227
Shri Mataji: Huh?

01:00:52.227 --> 01:00:54.007
Yogi: Or drunkenness.

01:00:54.007 --> 01:01:01.487
Shri Mataji: Drunkenness, also could be they
might have taken drugs or maybe, in the west

01:01:01.487 --> 01:01:10.697
anything is possible under the sun, you see,
or maybe, they’ve had some problems with

01:01:10.697 --> 01:01:16.867
their mothers or something like that basically
must be there but I think mostly it is due

01:01:16.867 --> 01:01:19.647
to neglect, complete neglect of the hair.

01:01:19.647 --> 01:01:28.437
You see these hair styles, now you go to any
person who is doing this hair styling within

01:01:28.437 --> 01:01:34.277
three years time we are bald, then they will
give a wig, that’s their business.

01:01:34.277 --> 01:01:37.347
So going to these hair dressers and all that
you develop it.

01:01:37.347 --> 01:01:40.657
What is the need to go to the hair dresser?

01:01:40.657 --> 01:01:41.857
I don’t understand.

01:01:41.857 --> 01:01:45.477
There’s no need, waste your time, waste
your money.

01:01:45.477 --> 01:01:46.987
You look very nice without it.

01:01:46.987 --> 01:01:50.987
Yogi: Is there a chance to get lost hair back?

01:01:50.987 --> 01:01:52.187
Shri Mataji: Huh?

01:01:52.187 --> 01:01:53.187
What she…?

01:01:53.187 --> 01:01:56.987
Yogi: Is there a chance to get lost hair back?

01:01:56.987 --> 01:02:01.777
Shri Mataji: Ah, you might.

01:02:01.777 --> 01:02:05.317
Try.

01:02:05.317 --> 01:02:14.487
If not by Sahaja Yoga, they say there is a
method.

01:02:14.487 --> 01:02:16.157
They put something here there [SHRI MATAJI
POINTS TO THE TOP OF HER HEAD] and they plant

01:02:16.157 --> 01:02:17.307
it and all those things they do.

01:02:17.307 --> 01:02:19.887
If you do it then I’ll see to it that they
grow well.

01:02:19.887 --> 01:02:22.767
Yogi: Why are diseases through generations
limited to seven generations?

01:02:22.767 --> 01:02:33.697
Or any trouble, Mother, that comes through
the generations?

01:02:33.697 --> 01:02:55.367
Shri Mataji: The problems are like this.

01:02:55.367 --> 01:03:04.767
There’s only one center which covers all
the seven centers which is the Mooladhara.

01:03:04.767 --> 01:03:08.287
Because it is the Omkara.

01:03:08.287 --> 01:03:13.957
It is the Chaitanya.

01:03:13.957 --> 01:03:19.887
If Mooladhara is insulted, say I said that
if there’s an incest relationship and the

01:03:19.887 --> 01:03:24.457
family grows then it is seven generations.

01:03:24.457 --> 01:03:31.247
But, if it is between a very holy relationship
like a mother and a son or something like

01:03:31.247 --> 01:03:38.907
that then it is fourteen generations.

01:03:38.907 --> 01:03:49.207
It’s complete insult of Shri Ganesh and
so many of these can come from there most

01:03:49.207 --> 01:03:52.807
of it comes because Shri Ganesha gives you
the real strength.

01:03:52.807 --> 01:03:54.697
Those who have insulted Shri Ganesha are always
delicate people physically, so you have to

01:03:54.697 --> 01:03:56.267
reestablish your Shri Ganesh.

01:03:56.267 --> 01:03:59.107
Yogi: …How to keep the body cool in summer?.

01:03:59.107 --> 01:04:00.107
Shri Mataji: Uh?

01:04:00.107 --> 01:04:11.297
Yogi: How to keep the body cool in summer?

01:04:11.297 --> 01:04:20.577
Shri Mataji: To keep the body cool in summer
first of all you have to do is to take some

01:04:20.577 --> 01:04:28.517
ice and rub it on your liver, keep the liver
cool, don’t think too much, don’t take

01:04:28.517 --> 01:04:35.497
hot things like in the summer time so many
people eat those watermelons and things like

01:04:35.497 --> 01:04:36.497
that.

01:04:36.497 --> 01:04:41.547
They should be cooled down properly, like
even mangos in India must be cooled down and

01:04:41.547 --> 01:04:42.777
then taken.

01:04:42.777 --> 01:04:47.507
All such fruits should be cooled down and
then eaten.

01:04:47.507 --> 01:04:51.367
Some people eat the mangos just from the tree,
that’s very wrong.

01:04:51.367 --> 01:04:55.257
You have to cool it down for twenty-four hours
and then eat it.

01:04:55.257 --> 01:04:59.147
This we knew all of us, but in modern times
I don’t know if people don’t know.

01:04:59.147 --> 01:05:00.947
All these things add up.

01:05:00.947 --> 01:05:07.267
Then reduce on meats and fish specially, you
should not eat fish in the summertime at all.

01:05:07.267 --> 01:05:13.577
First of all it is spoiled, something wrong
with it or else it has phosphorous which ignites

01:05:13.577 --> 01:05:14.577
you.

01:05:14.577 --> 01:05:18.017
So avoid all these things, eat things which
are cool.

01:05:18.017 --> 01:05:22.687
Now specially for India it is very easy because
we have got something called gool khand which

01:05:22.687 --> 01:05:28.397
is made out of rose petals which is a very
good thing for cooling the liver, then cardamom,

01:05:28.397 --> 01:05:31.987
then the candy sugar, sugar itself.

01:05:31.987 --> 01:05:38.437
All these things will cool down your liver
and you’ll feel very good.

01:05:38.437 --> 01:05:46.877
It’s the change in your diet is very important
during the summertime.

01:05:46.877 --> 01:05:57.527
Yogi: Hemorrhoids, is it a Mooladhara problem?

01:05:57.527 --> 01:05:59.047
Hemorrhoids?

01:05:59.047 --> 01:06:05.137
Shri Mataji: Right side.

01:06:05.137 --> 01:06:09.697
Right side Mooladhara.

01:06:09.697 --> 01:06:12.747
Right side.

01:06:12.747 --> 01:06:18.557
For that you have to keep yourself cool, again
get the cooling effects, all the cooling things

01:06:18.557 --> 01:06:24.297
to be done and also a very good thing is to
eat the black dried grapes.

01:06:24.297 --> 01:06:28.307
What do you call them?

01:06:28.307 --> 01:06:29.917
Yogi: Raisins.

01:06:29.917 --> 01:06:32.327
Shri Mataji: Raisins.

01:06:32.327 --> 01:06:37.627
Black raisins, soak them in the night with
some orange juice and eat them, I mean soak

01:06:37.627 --> 01:06:44.107
them in the morning eat them in the night
before sleeping.

01:06:44.107 --> 01:07:01.217
That

01:07:01.217 --> 01:07:18.977
will cool down, that’s very, very cooling
[HINDI] I’ve forgotten the name.

01:07:18.977 --> 01:07:33.927
[MARATHI] For allergy the best is gheru, you
take all of you, you should take gheru those

01:07:33.927 --> 01:07:42.417
who suffer from allergy and we get little
stone pieces round ones rub it on that and

01:07:42.417 --> 01:07:51.547
take it with some water about seven times
and then eat it, is good for allergies, but

01:07:51.547 --> 01:07:56.047
everybody should not only those who have allergies,
gheru is not good for people who have overactive

01:07:56.047 --> 01:07:57.047
liver.

01:07:57.047 --> 01:07:58.047
Now if you’re finished, huh..

01:07:58.047 --> 01:07:59.047
Shri Mataji: Kya?

01:07:59.047 --> 01:08:00.047
[IT MEANS “WHAT?”

01:08:00.047 --> 01:08:01.047
IN HINDI]

01:08:01.047 --> 01:08:20.007
Yogi: India has the biggest problem of leprosy
particularly Bihar and U.P., what is the reason?

01:08:20.007 --> 01:08:23.977
Shri Mataji: It’s a kind of a, you know
it’s an infectious disease and now they

01:08:23.977 --> 01:08:31.717
have found some sort of a thing for that leprosy,
is not only in India it was everywhere, but

01:08:31.717 --> 01:08:41.267
you know the [HINDI] the ones what you call
them the parasites which create this leprosy

01:08:41.267 --> 01:08:56.027
drink kerosene oil, petrol, they prosper in
petrol, do you know that?

01:08:56.027 --> 01:09:09.427
Yogi: What is the treatment in Sahaja for
that?

01:09:09.427 --> 01:09:14.377
Shri Mataji: For leprosy, you see, for any
infection as such it’s all left-sided.

01:09:14.377 --> 01:09:18.087
One can work it out but as far as possible
keep out of it.

01:09:18.087 --> 01:09:19.087
Infectious diseases you better not treat.

01:09:19.087 --> 01:09:25.927
This is very dangerous, I will never advise
you because you shouldn’t waste your energy

01:09:25.927 --> 01:09:28.937
on lepers now, leave them to Me.

01:09:28.937 --> 01:09:34.837
Which is the easiest way to cure yourself?

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:42.417
Yogi: What about people who are born with
epilepsy?

01:09:42.417 --> 01:09:47.707
Shri Mataji: Oh, epilepsy is curable, hundred
percent curable, it’s a left-sided problem,

01:09:47.707 --> 01:09:52.957
epilepsy whether born or anything can be cured,
can be cured.

01:09:52.957 --> 01:09:55.997
Yogi: [SAYS SOMETHING INAUDIBLE]

01:09:55.997 --> 01:09:56.997
Huh?

01:09:56.997 --> 01:09:57.997
Excessive?

01:09:57.997 --> 01:10:00.537
Yogi: Excessive tooth decay?

01:10:00.537 --> 01:10:03.577
Shri Mataji: Tooth decay?

01:10:03.577 --> 01:10:14.728
You see for tooth decay the thing is you must
use your fingers to rub on your teeth you

01:10:14.728 --> 01:10:18.357
see that’s the thing and also on your gums.

01:10:18.357 --> 01:10:22.147
So what you have because you have got vibrations,
your right Vishuddhi’s quite all right,

01:10:22.147 --> 01:10:27.877
it is due to right Vishuddhi, so what you
have to do is deficiency in Right Vishuddhi

01:10:27.877 --> 01:10:34.227
gives you, rub it nicely with olive oil and
little salt, very good finely thinned out

01:10:34.227 --> 01:10:45.907
salt and it will stop it everyday, everyday,
brushing is not sufficient.

01:10:45.907 --> 01:10:48.889
Shri Mataji: One more, one more.

01:10:48.889 --> 01:10:49.889
One more here.

01:10:49.889 --> 01:10:50.889
What’s it?

01:10:50.889 --> 01:10:51.889
Sit down, sit down.

01:10:51.889 --> 01:11:04.907
Yogi: What is the reason for having your intestines
all on the left side?

01:11:04.907 --> 01:11:07.947
Shri Mataji: All on the left side?

01:11:07.947 --> 01:11:11.607
Nothing on the right.

01:11:11.607 --> 01:11:13.437
Good idea.

01:11:13.437 --> 01:11:15.267
Left side.

01:11:15.267 --> 01:11:26.627
There’s no reason as such you see after
all think that God creates so many human beings.

01:11:26.627 --> 01:11:33.257
Even I mean you tell about two hundred people
to do some work, one goes this way, another

01:11:33.257 --> 01:11:39.347
goes that way, you don’t know what happens,
they go so helter-skelter.

01:11:39.347 --> 01:11:53.547
Now in that sometimes it’s a freak it happens,
there are freaks, it makes no difference.

01:11:53.547 --> 01:11:57.327
All right, what do you want?

01:11:57.327 --> 01:11:59.727
What’d she say?

01:11:59.727 --> 01:12:02.127
Yogi: Ulcerative colitis.

01:12:02.127 --> 01:12:12.177
Shri Mataji: Ulcerative colitis comes by people
who have amebiosis maybe one of them could

01:12:12.177 --> 01:12:14.827
be, is it there?

01:12:14.827 --> 01:12:15.827
Hmm.

01:12:15.827 --> 01:12:18.137
Yogi: Is there amebiosis?

01:12:18.137 --> 01:12:20.786
Shri Mataji: Yeah, yes.

01:12:20.786 --> 01:12:21.786
Could be due to that.

01:12:21.786 --> 01:12:28.547
Or could be due to very hot food if you eat,
or if you drink too much and all these things

01:12:28.547 --> 01:12:34.587
you see can be affecting, but mostly it is
due to amebiosis I’ve seen it and hot food,

01:12:34.587 --> 01:12:48.167
you shouldn’t eat hot food, like some people
like very hot food and they get this trouble.

01:12:48.167 --> 01:13:04.677
Yogi: Does anyone have a question that’s
a little more visionary?

01:13:04.677 --> 01:13:06.937
A little less medical.

01:13:06.937 --> 01:13:12.217
What about Hailey’s Comet appearing later
this year?

01:13:12.217 --> 01:13:15.507
Shri Mataji: I’ve seen it.

01:13:15.507 --> 01:13:23.677
This Mr. Hailey had seen it and he said this
will happen, that will happen and they say

01:13:23.677 --> 01:13:35.937
so it’s a good sign, let’s see, you see
whatever maybe the stars, whatever may be

01:13:35.937 --> 01:13:45.017
the things, unless and until human beings
become sensitive nothing can happen.

01:13:45.017 --> 01:13:50.637
We have to be sensitive people to receive
the blessings of these things otherwise Hailey

01:13:50.637 --> 01:13:55.077
may come, Mailey may come but we go on forever
to be.

01:13:55.077 --> 01:14:02.267
If we are become sensitive then only it will
happen, first of all when there is ego what’s

01:14:02.267 --> 01:14:04.947
it’s nothing is going to work out.

01:14:04.947 --> 01:14:13.167
Ego has to go down and you have to feel everything,
the vibrations and everything of the atmosphere

01:14:13.167 --> 01:14:25.647
of all the stars, then it will work out.

01:14:25.647 --> 01:14:33.457
Otherwise, it has no effect.

01:14:33.457 --> 01:14:44.797
Yogi: What is the proper attitude when we
take darshan from You?

01:14:44.797 --> 01:14:51.637
I’ve never known how to approach You.

01:14:51.637 --> 01:14:57.507
Shri Mataji: Oh, it’s rather embarrassing.

01:14:57.507 --> 01:15:11.197
All right I’ll close My eyes and My face
and I’ll tell you [MARATHI].

01:15:11.197 --> 01:15:12.197
Now.

01:15:12.197 --> 01:15:16.087
Your question is nice.

01:15:16.087 --> 01:15:32.197
Now supposing Christ appears before you and
you know He’s Christ, what will happen?

01:15:32.197 --> 01:15:46.727
That should be the attitude at least minimum,
though Christ had to manage only one chakra

01:15:46.727 --> 01:15:53.296
I have to manage seven.

01:15:53.296 --> 01:16:01.387
If that attitude develops even thinking of
Me is sufficient, you have to just think of

01:16:01.387 --> 01:16:07.597
Me your diseases will be cured.

01:16:07.597 --> 01:16:09.347
That depth has to be there.

01:16:09.347 --> 01:16:14.577
This is just one chakra seven times raised
to the power seven.

01:16:14.577 --> 01:16:18.407
That’s what it is.

01:16:18.407 --> 01:16:25.827
You have seen the miracles, you have seen
the photographs, you have seen thousands getting

01:16:25.827 --> 01:16:28.187
Realization, none of them did it.

01:16:28.187 --> 01:16:33.647
But also I’m Mahamaya.

01:16:33.647 --> 01:16:42.067
But in your heart you should know whom you
are facing.

01:16:42.067 --> 01:16:59.316
But mostly people get into the web of Mahamaya
very much that awe is so fulfilling, so penetrating,

01:16:59.316 --> 01:17:09.127
so deep that one lives with that idea only
all the time, you don’t need anything with

01:17:09.127 --> 01:17:10.127
that.

01:17:10.127 --> 01:17:16.997
It’s a very great fortune, if I were you
I would have called Myself the most fortunate

01:17:16.997 --> 01:17:24.737
person, but it’s the other way round, I
don’t know what to say then, though I must

01:17:24.737 --> 01:17:29.627
say that I’m very fortunate because compared
to all of them I have so many of you here

01:17:29.627 --> 01:17:37.477
who are Sahaja Yogis, so I’m very fortunate,
very happy about it, very happy, but still

01:17:37.477 --> 01:17:41.127
to grow in that you have to know what it is.

01:17:41.127 --> 01:17:52.097
Indians have senses, it goes easily into their
heads, they are very sensitive.

01:17:52.097 --> 01:18:38.617
In the same way I hope you develop it in that
way, in that fashion, then life would be very

01:18:38.617 --> 01:18:41.147
enjoyable.

01:18:41.147 --> 01:19:01.377
All right now coming back to something practical.

01:19:01.377 --> 01:19:13.618
I have to ask you have you made all the purchases
that are needed for your pujas in your various

01:19:13.618 --> 01:19:14.618
countries?

01:19:14.618 --> 01:19:20.807
Yogi: They are going to do some of it in Bombay,
on the day it’s available.

01:19:20.807 --> 01:19:25.137
When the busses go back in each case.

01:19:25.137 --> 01:19:32.747
Shri Mataji: Because all those who are going
Europeans, please raise your hands.

01:19:32.747 --> 01:19:33.747
By the earlier.

01:19:33.747 --> 01:19:34.747
Yogi: First bus.

01:19:34.747 --> 01:19:35.747
Shri Mataji: First bus.

01:19:35.747 --> 01:19:38.287
Yogi: Monday 7:15 the Egypt Airfly will leave
on the 17th morning.

01:19:38.287 --> 01:19:44.377
Shri Mataji: Now there’s one good solution
also, I was saying that if you start very

01:19:44.377 --> 01:19:48.377
early in the morning, next day you may reach
there for this work but the shops close very

01:19:48.377 --> 01:19:49.377
fast.

01:19:49.377 --> 01:19:55.137
Another one could be you make a list of things
that you want and send it over to Nima or

01:19:55.137 --> 01:20:04.207
someone, and they’ll keep it ready for you
so you need not go to the shop to get it.

01:20:04.207 --> 01:20:10.347
For example, if you want to buy a mukhoot,
you want to buy this and that, better give

01:20:10.347 --> 01:20:14.577
her a list and they will keep it ready for
you.

01:20:14.577 --> 01:20:23.307
As soon as you go you’ll get them, is a
better idea, don’t leave it to chances because

01:20:23.307 --> 01:20:29.607
when you travel you see you don’t know the
car may not take you at the right time, the

01:20:29.607 --> 01:20:39.987
shops maybe closed, being Sunday it’s going
to be difficult again, best is to make a list,

01:20:39.987 --> 01:20:44.887
even Saturday is very difficult there, it’s
so crowded and all that.

01:20:44.887 --> 01:20:51.867
So make a list of things that you want definitely,
and those otherwise you can try later on some

01:20:51.867 --> 01:20:59.297
that you want to buy personally but actually
these things are so common and so understandable

01:20:59.297 --> 01:21:06.247
you write it down whatever you want for your
puja.

01:21:06.247 --> 01:21:07.247
Have you got any list?

01:21:07.247 --> 01:21:09.297
Of say what one needs for the puja?

01:21:09.297 --> 01:21:11.747
No all together what you want to buy?

01:21:11.747 --> 01:21:15.287
Then make a list now, sit down and make a
list, now when you’ve made the list, I’ll

01:21:15.287 --> 01:21:17.227
send somebody to Bombay who will purchase
all these things, keep ready for you, put

01:21:17.227 --> 01:21:22.757
the price for you, you pay them and you take
them.

01:21:22.757 --> 01:21:29.157
I don’t think you’ll have much chance
to go to any shop and I would advise don’t

01:21:29.157 --> 01:21:31.767
go to any shop on a Saturday.

01:21:31.767 --> 01:21:39.497
On the contrary, you just go to the airport,
rest there and take your things.

01:21:39.497 --> 01:21:51.297
Yogi: They reach on Friday night, they have
all day Saturday and they go in the small

01:21:51.297 --> 01:21:52.297
hours of Sunday morning.

01:21:52.297 --> 01:21:54.827
Shri Mataji: Why do you want them to go on
Friday night?

01:21:54.827 --> 01:21:58.457
Better let them go on Saturday morning.

01:21:58.457 --> 01:22:01.027
Yogi: They choose that.

01:22:01.027 --> 01:22:03.597
Shri Mataji: I see.

01:22:03.597 --> 01:22:05.987
And what about you people?

01:22:05.987 --> 01:22:08.067
Yogi: We’re going the next day.

01:22:08.067 --> 01:22:12.447
We’ll leave on Saturday and the flights
not only until Tuesday or Wednesday.

01:22:12.447 --> 01:22:13.927
Shri Mataji: All right.

01:22:13.927 --> 01:22:18.527
Yogi: But if you suggest Mother that they
go on Saturday they’ll do it.

01:22:18.527 --> 01:22:21.477
No, is better go earlier because in any case.

01:22:21.477 --> 01:22:29.377
You know why I was saying that maybe you see
cars and this and that supposing it fails

01:22:29.377 --> 01:22:34.547
or something better to be there one day earlier.

01:22:34.547 --> 01:22:39.437
Try if you can get something because Saturday’s
such a crowded thing there, I don’t know.

01:22:39.437 --> 01:22:41.966
Yogi: We’ll still make this common list
for the puja.

01:22:41.966 --> 01:22:43.997
Shri Mataji: In any case you should.

01:22:43.997 --> 01:22:51.317
Whatever you have is all right, if you don’t
have you better make it here, I mean you spend

01:22:51.317 --> 01:22:57.557
so much time making the mookhut, what’s
the need?

01:22:57.557 --> 01:23:04.057
You can get it here ready made, very good
ones, any amount, any type you want, if you

01:23:04.057 --> 01:23:07.637
want to do it you can do it but normally there’s
no need.

01:23:07.637 --> 01:23:09.997
Yogi: They don’t know what mookhut is Mother?

01:23:09.997 --> 01:23:10.997
Shri Mataji: Huh?

01:23:10.997 --> 01:23:13.367
Yogi: You better tell them what mookhut is.

01:23:13.367 --> 01:23:15.437
Shri Mataji: Mookhut is the crown.

01:23:15.437 --> 01:23:16.437
Yes.

01:23:16.437 --> 01:23:20.117
All right, by all means you can see.

01:23:20.117 --> 01:23:22.197
It’s done or not.

01:23:22.197 --> 01:23:26.537
Yogi: [HINDI – Requesting Shri Mataji to
vibrate kumkum for Australia.]

01:23:26.537 --> 01:23:29.077
Shri Mataji: Ha, Ha, please bring it.

01:23:29.077 --> 01:23:31.677
[Individual conversations between Shri Mataji
and Yogi continues]

01:23:31.677 --> 01:23:35.387
Shri Mataji: For the hair, coconut oil is
the best.

01:23:35.387 --> 01:23:38.177
If before going, whatever silver you have
got you put it in your suitcase.

01:23:38.177 --> 01:23:41.797
Find it also customs you just … [voice breaks
a bit] Please tell them frankly that these

01:23:41.797 --> 01:23:46.247
are [Shri Mataji requests to increase the
volume of the microphone] … these are your

01:23:46.247 --> 01:23:51.197
wedding presents, would be better if you wrap
it with some …

01:23:51.197 --> 01:24:01.487
Shri Mataji tells a yogi specifically: It’s
not meant for you in any case, meant for married

01:24:01.487 --> 01:24:02.487
people.

01:24:02.487 --> 01:24:07.607
In case you are carrying the silver with you
then put it in your suitcases with a wrapper,

01:24:07.607 --> 01:24:11.677
with the wishing of somebody like that for
your marriage.

01:24:11.677 --> 01:24:14.537
You should say, “We got married.”

01:24:14.537 --> 01:24:17.877
Or, somebody has to say, “We re-married.

01:24:17.877 --> 01:24:19.307
It’s a present.”

01:24:19.307 --> 01:24:22.067
And, they won’t say anything to you.

01:24:22.067 --> 01:24:25.157
But in any case, they won’t see anything,
I hope so.

01:24:25.157 --> 01:24:28.867
Next time when you come don’t bring any
nonsensical thing like the one you brought

01:24:28.867 --> 01:24:29.937
last time.

01:24:29.937 --> 01:24:35.287
First was My television set the way it was
ruined.

01:24:35.287 --> 01:24:38.196
It’s all absurd ideas, I never do like that.

01:24:38.196 --> 01:24:39.966
You need not try to avoid paying customs.

01:24:39.966 --> 01:24:46.207
We have to pay where you have to pay.

01:24:46.207 --> 01:24:51.997
So, whatever you are bringing, each person
should not bring more that five hundred rupees

01:24:51.997 --> 01:24:53.257
worth, means about say, about twenty-five
pounds.

01:24:53.257 --> 01:24:56.877
Secondly, that whenever you bring such things
like tapes you should divide them into different

01:24:56.877 --> 01:24:57.877
people and then bring it.

01:24:57.877 --> 01:24:58.877
Don’t bring them together.

01:24:58.877 --> 01:24:59.877
Thirdly, whatever you bring you don’t send
it back without asking Me.

01:24:59.877 --> 01:25:00.877
There’s no logic in it.

01:25:00.877 --> 01:25:05.717
All the way you bring something here and why
do you send it back?

01:25:05.717 --> 01:25:09.687
Again, this is the same brain I think which
I cannot explain.

01:25:09.687 --> 01:25:11.677
Nobody can explain this.

01:25:11.677 --> 01:25:14.167
Yen, who took them back?

01:25:14.167 --> 01:25:16.157
[Yogi’s answer is inaudible]

01:25:16.157 --> 01:25:19.657
Shri Mataji: Who is he?

01:25:19.657 --> 01:25:21.837
From Bristol?

01:25:21.837 --> 01:25:25.037
You know we have paid for that.

01:25:25.037 --> 01:25:26.187
[Yogi’s answer is inaudible]

01:25:26.187 --> 01:25:27.337
Shri Mataji: But why?

01:25:27.337 --> 01:25:29.067
English originals, why did you send?

01:25:29.067 --> 01:25:31.927
You see, you are made in-charge of that, have
you?

01:25:31.927 --> 01:25:33.827
Who has made you in-charge?

01:25:33.827 --> 01:25:36.107
Warren made you in-charge, did he?

01:25:36.107 --> 01:25:37.997
Then, did you ask Warren?

01:25:37.997 --> 01:25:43.877
You don’t know you have sent also in that,
I had saved some tapes which were the bhajan

01:25:43.877 --> 01:25:44.877
tapes.

01:25:44.877 --> 01:25:49.467
I saved them that time when I was giving.

01:25:49.467 --> 01:25:52.997
I said, “Keep them for the villagers.”

01:25:52.997 --> 01:25:57.068
I’m saying did you appoint him as the in-charge
of the tapes?

01:25:57.068 --> 01:25:58.068
All right.

01:25:58.068 --> 01:26:00.257
What, he didn’t do these tapes.

01:26:00.257 --> 01:26:05.257
The tapes that he has sent back, he never
did it.

01:26:05.257 --> 01:26:07.077
That’s done by Paul.

01:26:07.077 --> 01:26:11.317
We have purchased them, gave it to Paul for
doing it.

01:26:11.317 --> 01:26:17.067
Now, I saved these ones when I was giving
the presents to people.

01:26:17.067 --> 01:26:19.417
I said, “Save these.”

01:26:19.417 --> 01:26:24.966
Because I have to take them for distribution
for the villagers and these tapes were sent

01:26:24.966 --> 01:26:25.966
back.

01:26:25.966 --> 01:26:26.966
He never asked Me.

01:26:26.966 --> 01:26:28.417
See, this is the trouble.

01:26:28.417 --> 01:26:34.197
When you are in-charge, doesn’t mean you
can do things like that.

01:26:34.197 --> 01:26:38.767
These are not your tapes that you sent them.

01:26:38.767 --> 01:26:43.847
We paid for it, we got it done through Paul.

01:26:43.847 --> 01:26:47.147
It has nothing to do with you.

01:26:47.147 --> 01:26:50.357
You never did these tapes.

01:26:50.357 --> 01:26:51.357
Nothing.

01:26:51.357 --> 01:26:53.567
No, you did not.

01:26:53.567 --> 01:26:54.847
I know.

01:26:54.847 --> 01:26:56.777
Paul did it.

01:26:56.777 --> 01:27:16.797
It was given to Paul, we paid for it, we asked
Paul to do it.

01:27:16.797 --> 01:27:21.667
He did it.

01:27:21.667 --> 01:27:33.057
These tapes are not done by you.

01:27:33.057 --> 01:27:39.287
If you have done it I don’t know but as
far as I know, they are done by Paul.

01:27:39.287 --> 01:27:45.357
And, I kept them back, I didn’t give them.

01:27:45.357 --> 01:27:53.517
Yesterday, I was really crestfallen because
I had told them that I’ll give it to the

01:27:53.517 --> 01:27:54.517
bhajan-mandals.

01:27:54.517 --> 01:27:59.367
And, it was not there.

01:27:59.367 --> 01:28:08.077
They asked Me, “Where are the tapes You
had promised us, Mother?”

01:28:08.077 --> 01:28:09.957
[Yogi’s answer is inaudible]

01:28:09.957 --> 01:28:15.677
Shri Mataji: I think you do not know because
I had kept about forty tapes or thirty tapes

01:28:15.677 --> 01:28:18.337
which were of Indian bhajans separately with
that.

01:28:18.337 --> 01:28:20.007
But what was the hurry?

01:28:20.007 --> 01:28:26.017
If you have to send something, you can always
send it later.

01:28:26.017 --> 01:28:28.716
[Yogi’s answer is inaudible]

01:28:28.716 --> 01:28:32.767
Shri Mataji: How do you know?

01:28:32.767 --> 01:28:35.147
You just sent the lot.

01:28:35.147 --> 01:28:36.147
How do you know?

01:28:36.147 --> 01:28:37.257
You didn’t see everything.

01:28:37.257 --> 01:28:41.107
Definitely, they are gone but why do anything
without asking?

01:28:41.107 --> 01:28:44.187
First of all, always do things with asking.

01:28:44.187 --> 01:28:46.487
You shouldn’t behave arbitrarily, first
point.

01:28:46.487 --> 01:28:50.337
Second point is that these things can be done
later.

01:28:50.337 --> 01:28:51.397
What is the hurry?

01:28:51.397 --> 01:28:56.676
Even Warren asks Me if he has to do something.

01:28:56.676 --> 01:28:59.807
Is a very common thing I know with the Western
mind.

01:28:59.807 --> 01:29:00.807
I’ve known that.

01:29:00.807 --> 01:29:03.047
I’ll tell you people used to live in My
house, they would just walk off keeping the

01:29:03.047 --> 01:29:04.817
door open, just walk off.

01:29:04.817 --> 01:29:05.877
Where’s he gone?

01:29:05.877 --> 01:29:06.877
God knows!

01:29:06.877 --> 01:29:07.877
He’s walked off.

01:29:07.877 --> 01:29:08.877
Very common.

01:29:08.877 --> 01:29:09.877
He just walked off.

01:29:09.877 --> 01:29:11.207
Where did he go?

01:29:11.207 --> 01:29:17.457
I mean, even if we have to go the bathroom,
we’ll tell somebody, “I’m going to the

01:29:17.457 --> 01:29:18.457
bathroom.”

01:29:18.457 --> 01:29:20.557
That’s our habit.

01:29:20.557 --> 01:29:26.517
No, it’s all right whatever it is but I’d
saved these.

01:29:26.517 --> 01:29:31.267
Now, I cannot locate it because it’s not
there.

01:29:31.267 --> 01:29:36.557
There was no need to send them back at all.

01:29:36.557 --> 01:29:38.177
What was the hurry?

01:29:38.177 --> 01:29:39.187
To whom are you committed?

01:29:39.187 --> 01:29:44.637
If not to Me, at least to Warren.

01:29:44.637 --> 01:29:48.347
Why they arranged these things?

01:29:48.347 --> 01:29:52.817
I think something goes out there.

01:29:52.817 --> 01:29:53.817
You better look after yourself.

01:29:53.817 --> 01:29:55.567
You have to do sadhana.

01:29:55.567 --> 01:29:58.347
You all must do sadhana.

01:29:58.347 --> 01:30:08.748
There’s one more thing: is that by saying
I’m a Sahaja Yogi, by believing I’m a

01:30:08.748 --> 01:30:13.957
Sahaja Yogi, you are not going to be helped.

01:30:13.957 --> 01:30:15.427
You have to do your meditation sincerely.

01:30:15.427 --> 01:30:17.417
You see, I know it’s not hypocrisy.

01:30:17.417 --> 01:30:18.417
But also it is not all out sincere effort.

01:30:18.417 --> 01:30:19.417
There’s something in between, the limbo
I would say.

01:30:19.417 --> 01:30:20.417
That’s not the way.

01:30:20.417 --> 01:30:22.467
We think we are Sahaja Yogis.

01:30:22.467 --> 01:30:24.837
All right, then do it.

01:30:24.837 --> 01:30:30.617
You have to everyday; all these Indian Sahaja
Yogis meditate everyday.

01:30:30.617 --> 01:30:31.617
Everyday.

01:30:31.617 --> 01:30:35.657
They are much more in a way evolved.

01:30:35.657 --> 01:30:38.216
They have a much better background.

01:30:38.216 --> 01:30:40.777
We have to fight all that.

01:30:40.777 --> 01:30:43.337
Everyday, they cannot live without it.

01:30:43.337 --> 01:30:44.337
All right?

01:30:44.337 --> 01:30:50.317
Now, try to meditate, try to take out because
you have problems there.

01:30:50.317 --> 01:30:53.267
That’s how you go off.

01:30:53.267 --> 01:30:57.437
Now, just don’t do anything arbitrarily,
ask ten people.

01:30:57.437 --> 01:30:59.297
I also ask you.

01:30:59.297 --> 01:31:01.607
I don’t do anything arbitrarily.

01:31:01.607 --> 01:31:08.827
Yesterday, when all the leaders were there,
I asked them what is to be done, isn’t it,

01:31:08.827 --> 01:31:09.827
Warren?

01:31:09.827 --> 01:31:10.827
Asked everyone.

01:31:10.827 --> 01:31:14.147
I can do everything Myself, I don’t do that.

01:31:14.147 --> 01:31:19.367
It’s a collective thing, you cannot do anything
like that.

01:31:19.367 --> 01:31:23.507
All right, that’s one thing now.

01:31:23.507 --> 01:31:25.307
Thank you very much.

01:31:25.307 --> 01:31:26.946
Next time, don’t do anything.

01:31:26.946 --> 01:31:34.797
It’s not only him, I’m telling all of
you.

01:31:34.797 --> 01:31:36.127
Don’t do anything arbitrarily.

01:31:36.127 --> 01:31:37.127
All right?

01:31:37.127 --> 01:31:38.127
May God bless you!

01:31:38.127 --> 01:31:39.127
Now, second is Felicity, come here.

01:31:39.127 --> 01:31:40.127
Felicity, you sit down.

01:31:40.127 --> 01:31:41.407
I have to tell you one thing.

01:31:41.407 --> 01:31:46.197
In Sahaja Yoga, you have come here to achieve
an ascent.

01:31:46.197 --> 01:31:52.867
You know you had lots of problems.

01:31:52.867 --> 01:31:56.837
You have not come here to achieve any positions,
know that.

01:31:56.837 --> 01:32:02.977
If you want to achieve positions, why don’t
you go to politics and spare us?

01:32:02.977 --> 01:32:07.338
You become ministers, prime ministers, do
what you like.

01:32:07.338 --> 01:32:10.877
Why do you want to start another center?

01:32:10.877 --> 01:32:12.597
[Answer is inaudible]

01:32:12.597 --> 01:32:13.597
Who is Danny?

01:32:13.597 --> 01:32:15.466
Is he you leader?

01:32:15.466 --> 01:32:17.357
Who is your leader?

01:32:17.357 --> 01:32:21.087
Then, why did you listen to Danny?

01:32:21.087 --> 01:32:23.277
Danny will do that.

01:32:23.277 --> 01:32:25.147
He’s gone back, he’ll tell you, he’ll
try to break your organization.

01:32:25.147 --> 01:32:29.297
Are you going to listen to him?

01:32:29.297 --> 01:32:31.477
He will do like this.

01:32:31.477 --> 01:32:39.897
You should have told him in all sense that
you better talk to Lori.

01:32:39.897 --> 01:32:42.497
Now, don’t listen to Danny.

01:32:42.497 --> 01:32:45.627
He’s already gone off his head.

01:32:45.627 --> 01:32:50.847
Actually, he made a horrible thing which you
can’t imagine.

01:32:50.847 --> 01:32:55.537
I mean, if I tell you, you’ll be shocked.

01:32:55.537 --> 01:32:57.017
He made a deed.

01:32:57.017 --> 01:33:01.047
He made the deed for the so-called registration
of the Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

01:33:01.047 --> 01:33:08.307
[Shri Mataji asks a Yogi] That one or the
other one also: Life Eternal Trust?

01:33:08.307 --> 01:33:10.147
[Yogi’s answer inaudible]

01:33:10.147 --> 01:33:25.157
You can say Life Eternal Trust and what he
did was that when I die he becomes the head.

01:33:25.157 --> 01:33:32.157
He becomes the head of the whole of the world,
Mr. Danny.

01:33:32.157 --> 01:33:34.907
That his great wife has achieved it.

01:33:34.907 --> 01:33:42.727
And, when he [Shri Mataji points to one of
the Yogis sitting there] found it out, he

01:33:42.727 --> 01:33:50.287
told Me, “Mother, what are You doing?”

01:33:50.287 --> 01:33:52.137
I trusted him, he’s such a good man.

01:33:52.137 --> 01:33:57.727
I don’t know how he got into this trap of
getting some sort of a power.

01:33:57.727 --> 01:33:59.307
Can you do that?

01:33:59.307 --> 01:34:00.307
You cannot.

01:34:00.307 --> 01:34:06.407
Started it [Shri Mataji smiles and shows thumbs
up and gives bandhan, Yogis chant Shri Mataji

01:34:06.407 --> 01:34:07.987
Nirmala Devi ki Jai]

01:34:07.987 --> 01:34:09.017
[Conversations in Marathi]

01:34:09.017 --> 01:34:13.157
You have to support Lori out and out.

01:34:13.157 --> 01:34:17.817
I must get good report about you from her.

01:34:17.817 --> 01:34:20.307
You know you had terrible problems, you know
that.

01:34:20.307 --> 01:34:23.127
I must get very good report from her.

01:34:23.127 --> 01:34:25.247
And, you must respect your leaders.

01:34:25.247 --> 01:34:27.007
Don’t treat them as equals.

01:34:27.007 --> 01:34:37.127
None of you are going to treat your leaders
as equals, you have to respect them and you

01:34:37.127 --> 01:34:43.677
have to listen to them.

01:34:43.677 --> 01:34:48.466
If something goes wrong with them, I will
remove them.

01:34:48.466 --> 01:34:50.477
Don’t start arbitrary behavior.

01:34:50.477 --> 01:34:55.007
This goes to this limit what Danny has done.

01:34:55.007 --> 01:35:00.307
Do you want to become like that?

01:35:00.307 --> 01:35:07.957
So don’t start any arbitrary behavior.

01:35:07.957 --> 01:35:14.947
And, if you want to make Me unhappy, I have
nothing to say but I’ve tried to make you

01:35:14.947 --> 01:35:23.107
happy by so many ways and so many methods
but if you want to make Me unhappy all the

01:35:23.107 --> 01:35:24.497
time, what can I do?

01:35:24.497 --> 01:35:26.947
I have to be unhappy.

01:35:26.947 --> 01:35:32.317
You don’t want to make Me unhappy, isn’t
it Felicity?

01:35:32.317 --> 01:35:37.247
All right, now go ahead and don’t do all
these things.

01:35:37.247 --> 01:35:38.687
It hurts Me.

01:35:38.687 --> 01:35:41.557
I mean, I just don’t understand.

01:35:41.557 --> 01:35:46.397
You have been with Me for so many days and
this thing, I’ve loved you so much, just

01:35:46.397 --> 01:35:47.397
can’t understand.

01:35:47.397 --> 01:35:49.687
Why do you want to hurt Me?

01:35:49.687 --> 01:35:51.437
All right, get up now.

01:35:51.437 --> 01:35:55.507
Now for something nice, we should say it’s
done is done, finished.

01:35:55.507 --> 01:36:10.227
You see, sometimes the ocean of forgiveness
gets so filled up that some of it like what

01:36:10.227 --> 01:36:18.387
you call the tushar in Marathi we say.

01:36:18.387 --> 01:36:23.367
I don’t know in English what is the word
is.

01:36:23.367 --> 01:36:26.807
Some drops come out from that on the shore.

01:36:26.807 --> 01:36:37.047
Try to love each other, try to be helpful
to each other, try to enjoy others – that’s

01:36:37.047 --> 01:36:38.827
what you are here for.

01:36:38.827 --> 01:36:46.027
Keep to your age, keep to your levels, keep
to your growth and also, you must understand

01:36:46.027 --> 01:36:57.267
that respect if you give, you get the respect
also.

01:36:57.267 --> 01:37:49.997
This is not the way one should behave in Sahaja
Yoga.

01:37:49.997 --> 01:38:11.707
I’m trying to build up a new world.

01:38:11.707 --> 01:38:15.687
You are doing God’s work.

01:38:15.687 --> 01:38:28.097
Just find out have you got sufficiently enough
understanding what work you are taking.

01:38:28.097 --> 01:38:37.077
Arbitrary behavior is absolutely cancerous
for Sahaja Yoga.

01:38:37.077 --> 01:38:45.647
Anybody does that, you point it out to others,
“This is arbitrary.”

01:38:45.647 --> 01:38:49.737
This has been done very much before also.

01:38:49.737 --> 01:38:53.867
You know how the money was collected arbitrarily
by Patrick.

01:38:53.867 --> 01:38:59.687
Terrible things happened and everybody supported
him, even Steve and everyone and people sent

01:38:59.687 --> 01:39:01.807
him money without asking Me.

01:39:01.807 --> 01:39:03.497
This is very sad.

01:39:03.497 --> 01:39:18.747
You are all Sahaja Yogis of such a level and
you must come up to that level and see that

01:39:18.747 --> 01:39:28.057
you are the people who are going to change
the whole world.

01:39:28.057 --> 01:39:35.497
You are the foundation of that.

01:39:35.497 --> 01:39:45.097
No arbitrary behavior should be there but
an understanding because you have to receive

01:39:45.097 --> 01:39:49.627
so much.

01:39:49.627 --> 01:39:57.067
Unless and until, you are respectful, you
cannot receive anything.

01:39:57.067 --> 01:40:01.847
Whatever you have to do please ask your leaders.

01:40:01.847 --> 01:40:04.577
Don’t do anything arbitrarily.

01:40:04.577 --> 01:40:16.757
The leader may be younger than you, may be
older than you, may be now he is appointed,

01:40:16.757 --> 01:40:19.647
you are an old Sahaja Yogi.

01:40:19.647 --> 01:40:25.437
Doesn’t matter, I know whom to appoint,
I’ve appointed that person there.

01:40:25.437 --> 01:40:27.317
All right.

01:40:27.317 --> 01:40:35.837
I hope you will give Me joy and happiness
as I have always tried to give you.

01:40:35.837 --> 01:40:37.017
May God bless you!

01:40:37.017 --> 01:40:43.177
Now, the ladies have arrived and they want
to give bangles to the ladies.

01:40:43.177 --> 01:40:50.657
They have brought the bangles for you.

01:40:50.657 --> 01:40:59.177
The reason is tomorrow is a great day, what
we call the Sankrant.

01:40:59.177 --> 01:41:04.587
Is a day when the Sun changes its meridian?

01:41:04.587 --> 01:41:09.927
It moves from the South to the North, towards
the Cancer.

01:41:09.927 --> 01:41:13.277
It moves towards the Cancer, you see.

01:41:13.277 --> 01:41:31.467
And, that’s how tomorrow is a very great
day for us, fourteenth.

01:41:31.467 --> 01:41:44.946
That day we say that that’s the day lots
of things happen.

01:41:44.946 --> 01:41:49.817
So, San Krant.

01:41:49.817 --> 01:41:56.067
Krant means revolution and San means holy.

01:41:56.067 --> 01:42:19.637
So is a day of holy revolution.

01:42:19.637 --> 01:42:29.107
Luckily we are here, we’ll be having a nice
puja, we’ll have an international puja also,

01:42:29.107 --> 01:42:33.057
everything will be done tomorrow very nicely.

01:42:33.057 --> 01:43:02.777
Now, one thing we have to do today that these
ladies have come to give bangles to you, to

01:43:02.777 --> 01:43:04.417
all the ladies.

01:43:04.417 --> 01:43:07.977
They have got all sizes.

01:43:07.977 --> 01:43:16.167
They showed Me what sizes I should take.

01:43:16.167 --> 01:43:56.567
I told them some of them should

01:43:56.567 --> 01:43:57.567
be maximum.

01:43:57.567 --> 01:43:58.567
[laughter] And, they’ve brought it.

01:43:58.567 --> 01:44:06.696
So as many as you can have, please have it.

01:44:06.696 --> 01:44:08.897
All right?

01:44:08.897 --> 01:44:11.097
[applause]

01:44:11.097 --> 01:44:36.737
[Marathi] We don’t offer them to men because
it is insulting.

01:44:36.737 --> 01:45:03.257
When

01:45:03.257 --> 01:45:32.716
the men don’t go for
a fight or they behave cowardly then women

01:45:32.716 --> 01:46:09.317
offer their bangles to men that, “You better
wear them, sit at home and I’ll go on

01:46:09.317 --> 01:46:17.797
the war.”

01:46:17.797 --> 01:46:29.257
There’s a saying, “Bangadya bhara.”

01:46:29.257 --> 01:47:02.897
Means to men if you say that

01:47:02.897 --> 01:47:13.387
that means now you are a coward.

01:47:13.387 --> 01:47:23.176
Means that in all languages.

01:47:23.176 --> 01:47:36.367
It’s a sanctuary here, so many birds.

01:47:36.367 --> 01:47:57.837
Have you seen those birds before or only they
have arrived today?

01:47:57.837 --> 01:48:10.047
Just go

01:48:10.047 --> 01:48:23.937
and have

01:48:23.937 --> 01:48:25.527
a look.

01:48:25.527 --> 01:48:40.477
We have everything by the kilos, you see.
