Shri Adi Shakti Puja 23rd June, 2002 Cabella Ligure, Italy

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:08.667
Today it's a different day altogether for all of you,

00:00:09.534 --> 00:00:18.334
because this is the Puja of Adi Shakti.

00:00:19.801 --> 00:00:27.033
And Adi Shakti is a complete personality,

00:00:27.634 --> 00:00:34.367
it's not only the left side that you know.

00:00:35.334 --> 00:00:42.033
You all know only the left side, from Shri Ganesha

00:00:43.601 --> 00:00:51.367
through the ascent of different, different chakras on the left side.

00:00:52.234 --> 00:00:58.133
I didn't want to tell you about the right side to begin with,

00:00:59.067 --> 00:01:07.067
because those who have gone through the right side got just lost.

00:01:10.167 --> 00:01:19.200
They got Gayatri Mantra from the writings

00:01:21.067 --> 00:01:24.000
but they didn't know what it was about,

00:01:24.734 --> 00:01:31.133
they just used to learn it by heart.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.067
They didn't also know the real meaning of it,

00:01:37.067 --> 00:01:43.067
and that is how they moved on the right side

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.367
and, I don’t know, they landed up at the Agnya;

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.567
and then they were trying for the Self-realization.

00:01:57.167 --> 00:02:03.067
They were promised that if you do this right side properly,

00:02:04.167 --> 00:02:10.234
you will reach to the ultimate goal of Self-realization.

00:02:11.367 --> 00:02:14.033
But none of them reached there.

00:02:14.567 --> 00:02:18.067
Most of them got into a terrible temper,

00:02:18.634 --> 00:02:25.067
terrible temper of cursing others, of destroying others.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:33.234
All these things they learnt through their right-side movement.

00:02:35.267 --> 00:02:38.067
There was no kundalini awakening,

00:02:39.067 --> 00:02:47.067
and they were made to go up to the, at the most, Agnya Chakra,

00:02:48.067 --> 00:02:55.167
and then they collapsed into different places of complete ignorance.

00:02:58.601 --> 00:03:06.767
All these books were written without understanding

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.500
that it's not easy to go via right side,

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:19.534
but best was to awaken your kundalini.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.033
The kundalini directly takes you up in the center of all the chakras,

00:03:26.601 --> 00:03:33.067
up to the Agnya and crosses Agnya, and goes beyond Agnya

00:03:33.534 --> 00:03:40.067
into the Sahasrara, and then it pierces through the Sahasrara.

00:03:40.667 --> 00:03:47.167
Now, what is so important about the Brahmarandra, from where it pierces?

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.300
I never told you about it.

00:03:51.067 --> 00:03:55.300
But now I think for most of you the time has come.

00:03:56.601 --> 00:04:02.167
You see in the childhood the child has a talu,

00:04:02.267 --> 00:04:07.567
is the fontanel bone area which is pulsating always.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:15.133
It is pulsating because the spirit entered through that area,

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.267
and when you close it, it settles in the heart.

00:04:24.167 --> 00:04:30.067
Now you have to become the spirit-oriented person,

00:04:30.467 --> 00:04:37.267
but how to enter into the Sahasrara was the problem.

00:04:38.734 --> 00:04:42.500
The tantrikas who were there, they went through the right, left side,

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:53.334
and they developed all the practices of black – we should say, the left side.

00:04:55.133 --> 00:05:02.567
So the right-sided became extremely hot-tempered, I should say,

00:05:02.667 --> 00:05:08.300
extremely ambitious, ferocious,

00:05:10.067 --> 00:05:18.467
and they started killing people on the basis of cursing.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.400
They are very good at cursing people;

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.500
to be always forward, push back all the people,

00:05:28.133 --> 00:05:32.133
and override everybody's rights.

00:05:32.534 --> 00:05:39.200
They were regarded as the most ambitious and most powerful people.

00:05:40.067 --> 00:05:46.300
Now the brahmins and to some extent the kshatriyas,

00:05:46.734 --> 00:05:49.167
they then took the right side.

00:05:50.067 --> 00:05:54.133
Because of the right side they became very powerful, no doubt.

00:05:55.067 --> 00:05:58.100
They got all the powers over the world

00:05:58.634 --> 00:06:08.334
and they were regarded as extremely powerful and majestic people,

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.601
but they were not, because they were so hot-tempered.

00:06:13.234 --> 00:06:16.634
Hot-tempered people cannot be spiritual.

00:06:17.367 --> 00:06:22.033
So they were told, “You'll get your spirituality, don't worry, keep moving,”

00:06:22.234 --> 00:06:29.434
and the seven chakras were described, on the right side.

00:06:31.133 --> 00:06:37.267
According to them there is bhuh, bhurvah.

00:06:38.033 --> 00:06:42.234
Bhuh is this prithivi, is this world, bhuh.

00:06:42.634 --> 00:06:48.567
Bhurvah is the complete cosmos, or we can call it antariksha.

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:55.033
Swaha: swaha is consumption at the Nabhi Chakra;

00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:01.267
and swadha is the, swadha is the consumption inside,

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:08.167
is to absorption – swaha, swadha.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Then is the mind, heart – manah.

00:07:19.601 --> 00:07:31.033
After manah came the Agnya – the Vishuddhi.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:37.367
The Vishuddhi is janah, collectivity, people,

00:07:37.767 --> 00:07:42.200
go to the people – janah.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:48.300
Then at the Agnya it is tapah.

00:07:49.601 --> 00:07:55.100
In tapah we have Christ in the center;

00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:06.033
left side they had Jainism, right side Christianity.

00:08:08.367 --> 00:08:12.200
They were not actually ascending path,

00:08:13.067 --> 00:08:18.534
they were just side outlets, we can say,

00:08:19.133 --> 00:08:25.701
for the energy of people who were trying to seek the truth.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:35.167
Now this happened for ages in India.

00:08:35.601 --> 00:08:38.200
All the gurus, all the sadhus,

00:08:39.267 --> 00:08:42.234
all the big tapassvis, all of them did this.

00:08:42.667 --> 00:08:45.067
But where did they reach?

00:08:45.434 --> 00:08:50.701
Tapassvis were the people who could give curses –

00:08:51.067 --> 00:08:56.100
kshu, shapah – to people, they could curse somebody.

00:08:57.334 --> 00:09:05.300
With the kataksha, is with the glance of the eye they could kill somebody,

00:09:06.067 --> 00:09:11.167
they could burn something; all right-sided powers they had.

00:09:11.667 --> 00:09:16.667
And with these right-sided powers, where did they reach?

00:09:17.534 --> 00:09:23.434
To hell, I should say, in a way – if not, in the limbo, as you call it.

00:09:25.067 --> 00:09:28.234
There nobody got Self-realization.

00:09:29.467 --> 00:09:39.067
You read the old books from India, but even otherwise the Greeks;

00:09:41.167 --> 00:09:47.534
and then we had Egyptians, English

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:55.167
and all kinds of aggressive people, Germans

00:09:55.467 --> 00:10:05.801
– all of them were aggressive – Catholics, and also you had Romans.

00:10:06.567 --> 00:10:08.601
All of them were aggressive,

00:10:09.133 --> 00:10:14.701
and were taking the land and property of other countries;

00:10:15.434 --> 00:10:21.300
extremely aggressive, they believed in the killing of the people -

00:10:24.534 --> 00:10:28.634
extremely, insulting, hot-tempered people.

00:10:29.667 --> 00:10:38.200
So how to bring them to the normal, to the central path?

00:10:41.767 --> 00:10:50.067
One side was, as I told you, bhuh, bhurv, swaha, swadha,

00:10:50.534 --> 00:10:55.167
it’s consumption – this was done by Guru Principle.

00:10:56.634 --> 00:11:03.067
Then we have manah, janah – that is collective.

00:11:03.434 --> 00:11:07.400
They became collective, no doubt, because they were so powerful

00:11:08.033 --> 00:11:17.367
that they had such a lot of people with them to fight for the oppressive.

00:11:17.767 --> 00:11:21.367
With their oppressive temperament they were fighting on people

00:11:21.367 --> 00:11:23.300
and were oppressing them.

00:11:25.067 --> 00:11:30.067
All this kind of … generation came in the history,

00:11:30.067 --> 00:11:33.200
as you know, and then it disappeared.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:43.234
Wars were created, then so many people were killed.

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:50.067
We had Hitler as the maximum of cruelty.

00:11:51.067 --> 00:11:55.067
They never cared for humanity.

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:59.701
Then ultimately it came to the Agnya.

00:12:00.367 --> 00:12:10.200
Agnya also they killed Jesus Christ, they destroyed Jesus Christ.

00:12:11.267 --> 00:12:15.067
They destroyed so many great saints who were really saints

00:12:15.167 --> 00:12:21.100
through the central path – some were incarnations –

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:23.367
and they destroyed them.

00:12:24.801 --> 00:12:33.434
All this happened since the time of Rama, all that has happened.

00:12:35.167 --> 00:12:39.601
And one after another so many rakshasas came,

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:46.067
and they destroyed the peaceful culture of the world;

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:53.367
extremely arrogant show-offs, as we can call them,

00:12:54.133 --> 00:12:56.500
very aggressive people.

00:12:57.534 --> 00:13:06.400
And this aggression came, came with such a great force,

00:13:07.534 --> 00:13:10.067
and followed one after another.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:16.133
It went up to a point.

00:13:16.467 --> 00:13:24.234
When people reacted, they were killed and were destroyed.

00:13:30.067 --> 00:13:34.200
So horrible people were created;

00:13:41.167 --> 00:13:56.067
all these people, as they were aggressive and destructive.

00:13:59.234 --> 00:14:07.367
This nature is still within us, some people, because they are right-sided.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:19.267
All right-side people had this problem: temper, aggression, controlling others.

00:14:20.601 --> 00:14:26.200
The growth stopped, and there was no spiritual growth.

00:14:27.601 --> 00:14:30.667
They wanted to have spirituality,

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:41.601
but with this kind of behavior they had developed, spirituality ran away.

00:14:43.234 --> 00:14:46.100
We had so many incarnations.

00:14:46.567 --> 00:14:51.400
They all were killed, crucified, or were finished.

00:14:53.367 --> 00:15:02.334
There was no possibility of saving human beings in general.

00:15:04.534 --> 00:15:07.701
One bad man came and he ruined the whole world.

00:15:08.634 --> 00:15:13.000
We had one Hitler who really hit all the people,

00:15:13.067 --> 00:15:17.734
all the countries, all the nations, and we were all finished.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:26.567
All this is because we have taken to right-sided movement

00:15:27.334 --> 00:15:31.334
which they thought was easier for spirituality, which was not.

00:15:32.467 --> 00:15:38.033
So they crossed all the limits, and they reached a stage

00:15:38.567 --> 00:15:45.567
that they became absolutely devils, rakshasas,

00:15:46.067 --> 00:15:50.634
without realizing that human beings are rakshasas,

00:15:51.534 --> 00:15:54.234
that's what they become.

00:15:57.667 --> 00:16:00.567
Even their gurus were like that,

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:09.234
and nothing but they tortured even the incarnations,

00:16:09.567 --> 00:16:12.601
all the incarnations were tortured by them.

00:16:13.567 --> 00:16:18.067
It was really – how they saved themselves is remarkable,

00:16:18.734 --> 00:16:24.033
but ultimately they couldn't produce any results.

00:16:25.467 --> 00:16:32.567
So the first thing I tried was to study about the kundalini,

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:37.500
that I should be able to raise the kundalini.

00:16:37.767 --> 00:16:40.167
And I knew I had come for that,

00:16:40.434 --> 00:16:45.267
not for anything else, but only to raise the kundalini of people

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:52.567
so that they take to the central path, not to the right or to the left.

00:16:53.367 --> 00:16:59.467
But I told you the knowledge of the left side, plus raising your kundalini.

00:17:00.334 --> 00:17:05.434
By raising your kundalini you broke your Sahasrara,

00:17:06.567 --> 00:17:18.234
and you entered into the realm of real joy, of reality.

00:17:19.801 --> 00:17:25.400
All these bad qualities started falling out.

00:17:27.067 --> 00:17:30.200
In the central path first the Mooladhara came.

00:17:31.334 --> 00:17:35.334
By the awakening of the Mooladhara and the central path,

00:17:36.167 --> 00:17:41.067
you became very pure people.

00:17:41.701 --> 00:17:46.467
Your eyes became pure, your licentiousness went away,

00:17:47.067 --> 00:17:52.000
your cheapness went away and you became very, very –

00:17:56.367 --> 00:17:59.567
I think we should call them the holy people.

00:18:00.334 --> 00:18:05.033
Unless and until that happens you cannot be in Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:05.634 --> 00:18:10.467
You cannot be a licentious, you cannot be a flirtish,

00:18:10.734 --> 00:18:16.500
you cannot be a man who wants to grab money from others and all that,

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.334
or anyone who is very aggressive could be in Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:22.167 --> 00:18:24.300
So all such people were thrown out.

00:18:24.567 --> 00:18:28.133
Once they were thrown out they were showing their teeth, I should say.

00:18:28.367 --> 00:18:31.133
They didn't like it that they were thrown out.

00:18:31.367 --> 00:18:37.033
But they understand now, some of them, that “we have made mistakes.”

00:18:37.367 --> 00:18:44.434
So first thing is that you must develop your sense of chastity,

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:49.033
respect it and enjoy it.

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:54.500
That happened because of your Mooladhara being awakened.

00:18:55.467 --> 00:19:03.267
That's the first chakra on the left side, where you have Shri Ganesha.

00:19:04.534 --> 00:19:08.234
But on the right side also we have deities.

00:19:08.367 --> 00:19:14.234
On every chakra we have deities to compensate,

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.534
but Shri Ganesha is in the center.

00:19:19.567 --> 00:19:26.267
And that's how we were blessed by His powerful purity,

00:19:27.067 --> 00:19:31.100
and we started understanding the beauty of purity,

00:19:31.434 --> 00:19:34.234
the power of purity.

00:19:37.467 --> 00:19:42.400
That's how our right side we finished off.

00:19:43.067 --> 00:19:49.367
Right side was for fighting, for killing, anger.

00:19:51.567 --> 00:19:54.534
There was no peace for these people.

00:19:55.234 --> 00:20:02.033
The only thing they knew how to dominate others, and to be intolerable.

00:20:03.534 --> 00:20:12.033
So then they rose to a higher, to higher level of Swadisthan.

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:17.167
In Swadisthana they rose,

00:20:17.601 --> 00:20:24.200
and the aggressiveness of the creative people to create something.

00:20:25.334 --> 00:20:27.300
Even now we have many.

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:32.601
They create all kinds of nonsense, create all sorts of grotesque,

00:20:33.067 --> 00:20:42.500
also very, very, I should say, dirty things to make a name.

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:47.100
So this is the another thing we got it in Swadisthana,

00:20:47.234 --> 00:20:52.133
people who wanted to have a name, a position –

00:20:53.367 --> 00:20:56.367
that came from right Swadisthana.

00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:03.601
Then the third chakra that was there was the Nabhi Chakra.

00:21:04.367 --> 00:21:08.400
On the Nabhi Chakra they went all out to make money,

00:21:08.467 --> 00:21:14.300
not Lakshmi but money, money by any means,

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:19.300
and they cheated the whole world.

00:21:19.601 --> 00:21:27.000
With this money that they got, they did all kinds of bad things.

00:21:29.601 --> 00:21:35.400
Either they cheated or they were aggressive.

00:21:36.601 --> 00:21:43.067
Cheating was very much in the left-side countries like India,

00:21:44.367 --> 00:21:48.567
and aggressiveness in the right-side countries.

00:21:51.167 --> 00:21:58.200
In the center, what quality we have at the Swadisthana is the creativeness:

00:21:58.701 --> 00:22:02.467
creative of art, which is very beautiful,

00:22:02.567 --> 00:22:07.500
which is very deep, which is absolutely spiritual.

00:22:08.334 --> 00:22:12.234
That vanished, and people started showing

00:22:12.267 --> 00:22:16.367
even the incarnations full of dirty habits.

00:22:17.467 --> 00:22:21.567
All kinds of filth came in with that progress.

00:22:23.667 --> 00:22:26.734
Then, as I told you, there's Nabhi.

00:22:27.367 --> 00:22:35.067
In Nabhi people got after money.

00:22:36.701 --> 00:22:39.067
Left-sided people were making money,

00:22:39.133 --> 00:22:41.601
right-sided were aggressive with their money.

00:22:41.667 --> 00:22:45.334
If they were earning they thought they’re on top of the world.

00:22:46.167 --> 00:22:50.234
If they had money they thought, “Nobody is better than us.”

00:22:51.534 --> 00:22:56.734
All this finished them off, it's finishing.

00:22:57.167 --> 00:23:00.500
It will come to that point where they will realize

00:23:01.033 --> 00:23:06.234
that money is not for destroying but for construction:

00:23:06.767 --> 00:23:11.133
constructing of the country, constructing of the human beings together

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:14.167
to bring peace and love among them,

00:23:15.267 --> 00:23:21.467
for helping, for doing all kinds of good things.

00:23:23.334 --> 00:23:34.334
Then the same right-sided people went to the chakra of the Mother,

00:23:36.167 --> 00:23:41.200
and they were horrible mothers, tried to dominate their children,

00:23:41.434 --> 00:23:48.434
dominate everyone, and could not sacrifice anything for the children.

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:52.334
We have had enough of these women

00:23:52.667 --> 00:23:57.234
who are aggressive with their husbands, are aggressive with their children.

00:23:58.067 --> 00:24:02.400
And even the motherhood among men is dead and finished.

00:24:04.067 --> 00:24:09.067
All that kind of lot when I came on this Earth I saw,

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:13.400
and I was shocked – what sort of human beings are those?

00:24:13.701 --> 00:24:16.100
What am I going to do with them?

00:24:16.467 --> 00:24:19.133
How will I awaken their kundalini?

00:24:20.067 --> 00:24:23.133
At the Nabhi Chakra only they were lost,

00:24:24.167 --> 00:24:27.033
but now it is the Mother's chakra.

00:24:27.367 --> 00:24:32.667
They had no fatherhood, no motherhood, they drove out their children –

00:24:33.367 --> 00:24:38.400
very selfish, self-centered, dominating parents.

00:24:45.067 --> 00:24:47.434
This was the Heart Chakra.

00:24:49.133 --> 00:24:53.334
Then came the collective chakra, what we call as the Vishuddhi.

00:24:54.133 --> 00:24:59.200
At the Vishuddhi Chakra they wanted to occupy the whole world.

00:25:00.267 --> 00:25:09.400
They wanted to occupy the whole world as their own to become emperors,

00:25:09.634 --> 00:25:14.500
and they formed empires and misbehaved to such an extent

00:25:15.067 --> 00:25:18.067
that it's not humanly possible to behave like that.

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:20.367
They really were rakshasas, I should say,

00:25:20.567 --> 00:25:23.434
and those rakshas qualities are still there.

00:25:24.133 --> 00:25:28.267
In their behavior, in everything you can see how they behave

00:25:28.434 --> 00:25:33.100
towards people, treating them like that,

00:25:33.567 --> 00:25:40.400
creating people who are against spirituality,

00:25:41.067 --> 00:25:44.067
and those who are aggressive.

00:25:45.334 --> 00:25:49.634
Well, these became like a two-sided world

00:25:49.767 --> 00:25:54.300
where there are people who are aggressive,

00:25:55.067 --> 00:25:57.267
and the people who are tortured.

00:25:57.534 --> 00:26:07.167
This two-sided world exists even now, but is much less.

00:26:08.467 --> 00:26:12.267
Thanks to the collective understanding

00:26:12.334 --> 00:26:17.133
there are many good institution that were established

00:26:17.467 --> 00:26:22.067
but they are not working out, they are not so successful,

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:28.300
because the men at the head of it are controlling, but controlling what?

00:26:28.567 --> 00:26:31.567
Not themselves – controlling others,

00:26:32.067 --> 00:26:37.267
and all their behavior has spoilt all the work of this chakra.

00:26:39.067 --> 00:26:43.067
Collectively you have, if you see around now today

00:26:43.267 --> 00:26:50.200
everywhere there’s war going on, fights going on, killing going on,

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:55.567
destruction going on. How is it?

00:26:56.300 --> 00:27:01.167
There are so many spiritual people here now on this world.

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:06.000
So the reason is, the spiritual people have become very quiet,

00:27:06.367 --> 00:27:09.434
very much enjoying their spiritual life,

00:27:10.167 --> 00:27:16.067
have become very quiet and very peaceful people.

00:27:16.534 --> 00:27:19.434
But that doesn't bring peace.

00:27:20.267 --> 00:27:25.133
You have to be dynamic and you have to bring peace in the world,

00:27:25.267 --> 00:27:27.200
you have to do something about it.

00:27:27.534 --> 00:27:30.267
We are very much satisfied with our progress,

00:27:30.534 --> 00:27:35.534
but we are not bothered as to see what is the progress others have done,

00:27:36.234 --> 00:27:39.300
how far they have gone, where can we meet them,

00:27:39.467 --> 00:27:41.234
what can we change them.

00:27:41.334 --> 00:27:43.801
At My level I can change many things,

00:27:44.167 --> 00:27:47.267
but at your level how many people have you changed?

00:27:47.634 --> 00:27:51.033
What have you done? That has to be said.

00:27:51.133 --> 00:27:55.267
Still you live with your ego, on the Agnya,

00:27:56.534 --> 00:27:59.200
and you are very happy with your peace,

00:27:59.334 --> 00:28:02.133
with everything you have got through Sahaja Yoga.

00:28:02.434 --> 00:28:06.334
This is the biggest calamity that the world is facing today,

00:28:06.634 --> 00:28:11.567
that those who are all so spiritual, those who have achieved great heights

00:28:11.667 --> 00:28:15.400
are least bothered as to what good has to be done.

00:28:15.767 --> 00:28:19.667
What they are doing is to enjoy their own spirituality,

00:28:20.467 --> 00:28:24.067
come to the puja, have more and more of it.

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:30.334
But they have done no collective work to change people.

00:28:30.467 --> 00:28:33.300
Some of them are working, one or two,

00:28:33.601 --> 00:28:36.167
but the rest of them are having a good time

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:40.067
enjoying themselves in such a manner

00:28:40.534 --> 00:28:46.367
that people accept them as great souls, good people, that's all.

00:28:47.267 --> 00:28:49.734
I would like you to now introspect

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:53.133
and find out how much collective work you have done,

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:57.634
how many people you have got – like that.

00:28:58.067 --> 00:29:00.267
With whom are you talking?

00:29:00.534 --> 00:29:03.534
How many people have you told about Sahaja Yoga?

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:06.067
Only so many are there.

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:11.234
Christ had only twelve disciples; they were much more dynamic than you are.

00:29:11.734 --> 00:29:14.300
So now you should take to the right side.

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:19.067
And when you take to the right side we'll create dynamic people,

00:29:19.567 --> 00:29:28.467
not just some useless, patient, very quiet, peaceful people.

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:31.100
This was not the aim of Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:31.334 --> 00:29:36.467
The aim of Sahaja Yoga is to change, change so many.

00:29:37.334 --> 00:29:40.567
And those who are doing that, all My blessings are with them.

00:29:41.167 --> 00:29:45.767
But those who are just keeping to themselves, it is not a very good thing.

00:29:46.267 --> 00:29:49.734
In your country how many people have got to Sahaja Yoga?

00:29:50.067 --> 00:29:54.133
Just find out. With how many people you have worked it out?

00:29:54.334 --> 00:29:59.334
So yours is not a complete yoga, yours is a partial yoga of the left side,

00:29:59.367 --> 00:30:02.534
where you are very loving, you are very kind, very this thing.

00:30:02.801 --> 00:30:05.500
I am not saying that you should become aggressive in any way.

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:11.701
But even I have seen people want to be leaders, they want to be something great;

00:30:12.133 --> 00:30:15.067
but how many people have they given realization?

00:30:15.234 --> 00:30:18.634
How many people have they talked about Sahaja Yoga?

00:30:19.167 --> 00:30:22.167
I have said even in the aeroplane also you go,

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:26.133
you walk in the street, anywhere people talk about Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:26.434 --> 00:30:31.100
But here we are using Sahaja Yoga for our greatness,

00:30:31.334 --> 00:30:35.667
for our understanding of ourselves.

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:39.367
This is not why Sahaja Yoga has been brought to you.

00:30:40.033 --> 00:30:46.167
It has been brought to you for giving realizations to many people.

00:30:47.267 --> 00:30:49.334
I request all the younger people, younger generation

00:30:49.367 --> 00:30:53.067
not to waste their Sahaj energies

00:30:53.167 --> 00:30:55.434
on nonsense as the old people have done.

00:30:56.067 --> 00:30:59.200
You’d better go ahead and talk to people about Sahaja Yog,

00:30:59.334 --> 00:31:01.200
and spread the Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:07.200
They are more interested in running schools, in looking after the destitute,

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:09.400
doing this, - doing that – that's not your job.

00:31:09.734 --> 00:31:14.667
Your job is to create more Sahaja yogis, more Sahaja yoginis.

00:31:14.801 --> 00:31:19.234
But that is not there, what I find is it's not there.

00:31:19.567 --> 00:31:23.434
The right side is missing. You should come to the right side.

00:31:23.734 --> 00:31:30.033
Go all ahead. Nothing will happen to you. Nobody can kill you,

00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:34.200
nobody can disturb you, nobody can arrest you, take it from Me.

00:31:34.467 --> 00:31:39.300
You have powers but if you don't use them, you are like this.

00:31:40.701 --> 00:31:44.601
That is why we have come to the stagnated point

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:48.200
that we should know we have to use our right side.

00:31:48.467 --> 00:31:51.267
Right side is very important.

00:31:52.167 --> 00:31:56.434
Next time I'll tell you about right side, what right-sided things you have.

00:31:56.567 --> 00:31:59.500
Now you cannot become left-sided whatever you may try;

00:31:59.601 --> 00:32:04.400
so you use your right side in the right direction

00:32:04.701 --> 00:32:11.033
with the right understanding, not as some sort of,

00:32:11.133 --> 00:32:18.434
I should say, very arbitrary or very dominating, like Hitlers.

00:32:19.234 --> 00:32:22.234
We have had also Hitlers among Sahaja yogis.

00:32:22.467 --> 00:32:25.334
But now the time has come for you

00:32:25.734 --> 00:32:29.534
to do something more than what the saints have done before,

00:32:30.167 --> 00:32:33.434
to work it out that way; not to keep to yourself

00:32:33.601 --> 00:32:38.067
that you have a family, you have very nice children,

00:32:38.067 --> 00:32:41.334
having, enjoying, all that – that's not the Sahaja Yoga for.

00:32:42.801 --> 00:32:47.634
Sahaja Yoga is for transforming the whole world.

00:32:48.534 --> 00:32:53.500
You have to think about it: what are you doing, where are you,

00:32:54.234 --> 00:32:58.200
and what have you achieved out of Sahaja Yoga?

00:32:58.601 --> 00:33:02.300
Then we come to the Agnya.

00:33:03.534 --> 00:33:08.734
In Agnya what has happened is Sahaja yogis are become, they have,

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:15.100
they can bear anything, they can suffer anything – that's not we want.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.500
What we want, to remove the sufferings of others,

00:33:20.234 --> 00:33:22.400
remove the aggression of others.

00:33:22.634 --> 00:33:27.367
So we don't, that kind of organization we don't have,

00:33:28.067 --> 00:33:30.467
that kind of understanding we don’t have.

00:33:30.801 --> 00:33:35.434
And if that works out, you will be different people.

00:33:36.067 --> 00:33:42.367
So we have become like saints, you see, sitting in their hermit halls,

00:33:42.367 --> 00:33:47.234
something like that, not more than that.

00:33:48.067 --> 00:33:53.634
So better try to do something positive, without aggression.

00:33:53.801 --> 00:34:00.067
I know some of you are still very aggressive, are show-offs, I know that.

00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:08.567
But if you get into the mood of working out collectively,

00:34:09.367 --> 00:34:13.567
then you will realize what mistakes you have,

00:34:14.667 --> 00:34:20.534
still what is lacking in your personality – that is very important.

00:34:20.801 --> 00:34:24.567
At Agnya Chakra many Sahaja yogis falter,

00:34:26.133 --> 00:34:28.634
I don't know what happens to them.

00:34:29.367 --> 00:34:32.567
At Agnya I have told that you must forgive.

00:34:33.167 --> 00:34:37.400
But that doesn't mean that you allow people to do wrong things.

00:34:38.234 --> 00:34:41.534
Because you want to forgive it's very easy not to fight,

00:34:41.567 --> 00:34:45.500
not to say anything, just keep out, just forgive – no.

00:34:46.334 --> 00:34:53.634
You go and talk to that person and tell him it is wrong.

00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:58.100
You have to face it.

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:04.267
If you cannot face it then you are useless, just like any other people.

00:35:04.767 --> 00:35:08.534
What's the use of you people getting your realization?

00:35:10.234 --> 00:35:15.634
So now we have to understand that it's not only that we have vibrations,

00:35:15.634 --> 00:35:18.100
that we are all right,

00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:22.367
that you can cure some people is the last word – no.

00:35:23.267 --> 00:35:26.100
You have to spread it, you have to go in the public,

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:29.200
you have to be collective on this point

00:35:29.234 --> 00:35:30.500
and you have to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:37.200
With so many Sahaja yogis all over the world we have not progressed much.

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:42.534
So now it is you have to plan what you want to do,

00:35:42.634 --> 00:35:46.267
how you want to do it, and how you want to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:35:46.567 --> 00:35:49.567
It's very important.

00:35:51.067 --> 00:35:58.067
Because you people are good at, say, talking about Sahaja Yoga,

00:35:58.067 --> 00:36:02.534
singing about Sahaja Yoga; all these things are useless unless and until

00:36:02.534 --> 00:36:08.234
you have concrete proof of getting many more people in Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:09.434 --> 00:36:11.500
In a small country like Turkey

00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:15.634
we have 25000 Sahaja yogis, what do you say?

00:36:16.133 --> 00:36:24.033
They are all Muslims, twenty-five thousands Muslim becoming Sahaja yogis,

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:30.067
while you find that number is very small in any other country.

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:36.367
They are not very rich, but they care for their Self-realization

00:36:36.567 --> 00:36:39.467
and for toward giving Self-realizations to others.

00:36:40.067 --> 00:36:45.367
It's very surprising how it has worked out, how it has spread.

00:36:46.267 --> 00:36:54.634
So instead of thinking of your problems, of your enemies, of your powers,

00:36:55.067 --> 00:36:57.267
think of giving power to others

00:36:57.467 --> 00:37:01.367
and making them Sahaja Yoga – it's very important.

00:37:02.133 --> 00:37:06.267
If you are in Sahasrara then you have all the powers.

00:37:07.367 --> 00:37:10.267
In Sahasrara if you do not spread Sahaja Yoga,

00:37:10.467 --> 00:37:12.534
what's the use of getting realization?

00:37:12.801 --> 00:37:16.400
Just for yourself – it's being very selfish.

00:37:16.667 --> 00:37:25.567
So I would say that instead of spreading your own glory, your own name,

00:37:26.067 --> 00:37:29.667
please try to get more people to Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:30.267 --> 00:37:33.534
Go into a very dynamic force.

00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:36.434
So many people have complained to Me

00:37:37.033 --> 00:37:40.500
that Sahaja yogis are nothing but dead people.

00:37:41.534 --> 00:37:44.334
Is that what you are?

00:37:45.367 --> 00:37:51.334
Only single person like Me has done so much work, so why not you people?

00:37:52.234 --> 00:37:55.367
In your country have you worked it out all over?

00:37:56.067 --> 00:37:57.634
Just think about it.

00:37:58.167 --> 00:38:02.100
And that's why, unless and until you don't do it you are not sampurna,

00:38:02.133 --> 00:38:03.334
you are not complete,

00:38:03.567 --> 00:38:08.534
and the Adi Shakti's powers you have not understood in its full form.

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:13.033
That's why I'm telling you today it's a very important day

00:38:13.067 --> 00:38:15.300
that you worship Me as Adi Shakti.

00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:19.167
But you should know that Adi Shakti has to be a complete form.

00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:22.634
It cannot be only half left-sided – no.

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:27.434
If that doesn't work out, then what's the use?

00:38:27.634 --> 00:38:34.300
It's like any other getting any other realization – that's not so important.

00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:37.100
Not only that you should spread,

00:38:37.267 --> 00:38:41.534
but also you should make them, and realize it.

00:38:49.167 --> 00:38:54.400
All My blessings, all My love, all My powers I give you;

00:38:55.234 --> 00:38:59.534
but try to understand. All right?

00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:03.000
Thank you very much.
