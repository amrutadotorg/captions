00:00.000 --> 00:01.300
Shri Adi Shakti Puja 23rd June, 2002 Cabella Ligure, Italy

00:01.500 --> 00:08.667
Today it's a different day altogether for all of you,

00:09.534 --> 00:18.334
because this is the Puja of Adi Shakti.

00:19.801 --> 00:27.033
And Adi Shakti is a complete personality,

00:27.634 --> 00:34.367
it's not only the left side that you know.

00:35.334 --> 00:42.033
You all know only the left side, from Shri Ganesha

00:43.601 --> 00:51.367
through the ascent of different, different chakras on the left side.

00:52.234 --> 00:58.133
I didn't want to tell you about the right side to begin with,

00:59.067 --> 01:07.067
because those who have gone through the right side got just lost.

01:10.167 --> 01:19.200
They got Gayatri Mantra from the writings

01:21.067 --> 01:24.000
but they didn't know what it was about,

01:24.734 --> 01:31.133
they just used to learn it by heart.

01:32.300 --> 01:36.067
They didn't also know the real meaning of it,

01:37.067 --> 01:43.067
and that is how they moved on the right side

01:44.300 --> 01:49.367
and, I don’t know, they landed up at the Agnya;

01:52.200 --> 01:56.567
and then they were trying for the Self-realization.

01:57.167 --> 02:03.067
They were promised that if you do this right side properly,

02:04.167 --> 02:10.234
you will reach to the ultimate goal of Self-realization.

02:11.367 --> 02:14.033
But none of them reached there.

02:14.567 --> 02:18.067
Most of them got into a terrible temper,

02:18.634 --> 02:25.067
terrible temper of cursing others, of destroying others.

02:25.400 --> 02:33.234
All these things they learnt through their right-side movement.

02:35.267 --> 02:38.067
There was no kundalini awakening,

02:39.067 --> 02:47.067
and they were made to go up to the, at the most, Agnya Chakra,

02:48.067 --> 02:55.167
and then they collapsed into different places of complete ignorance.

02:58.601 --> 03:06.767
All these books were written without understanding

03:07.300 --> 03:11.500
that it's not easy to go via right side,

03:13.300 --> 03:19.534
but best was to awaken your kundalini.

03:20.500 --> 03:26.033
The kundalini directly takes you up in the center of all the chakras,

03:26.601 --> 03:33.067
up to the Agnya and crosses Agnya, and goes beyond Agnya

03:33.534 --> 03:40.067
into the Sahasrara, and then it pierces through the Sahasrara.

03:40.667 --> 03:47.167
Now, what is so important about the Brahmarandra, from where it pierces?

03:48.100 --> 03:50.300
I never told you about it.

03:51.067 --> 03:55.300
But now I think for most of you the time has come.

03:56.601 --> 04:02.167
You see in the childhood the child has a talu,

04:02.267 --> 04:07.567
is the fontanel bone area which is pulsating always.

04:08.200 --> 04:15.133
It is pulsating because the spirit entered through that area,

04:16.400 --> 04:22.267
and when you close it, it settles in the heart.

04:24.167 --> 04:30.067
Now you have to become the spirit-oriented person,

04:30.467 --> 04:37.267
but how to enter into the Sahasrara was the problem.

04:38.734 --> 04:42.500
The tantrikas who were there, they went through the right, left side,

04:43.100 --> 04:53.334
and they developed all the practices of black – we should say, the left side.

04:55.133 --> 05:02.567
So the right-sided became extremely hot-tempered, I should say,

05:02.667 --> 05:08.300
extremely ambitious, ferocious,

05:10.067 --> 05:18.467
and they started killing people on the basis of cursing.

05:19.100 --> 05:21.400
They are very good at cursing people;

05:22.500 --> 05:27.500
to be always forward, push back all the people,

05:28.133 --> 05:32.133
and override everybody's rights.

05:32.534 --> 05:39.200
They were regarded as the most ambitious and most powerful people.

05:40.067 --> 05:46.300
Now the brahmins and to some extent the kshatriyas,

05:46.734 --> 05:49.167
they then took the right side.

05:50.067 --> 05:54.133
Because of the right side they became very powerful, no doubt.

05:55.067 --> 05:58.100
They got all the powers over the world

05:58.634 --> 06:08.334
and they were regarded as extremely powerful and majestic people,

06:08.500 --> 06:12.601
but they were not, because they were so hot-tempered.

06:13.234 --> 06:16.634
Hot-tempered people cannot be spiritual.

06:17.367 --> 06:22.033
So they were told, “You'll get your spirituality, don't worry, keep moving,”

06:22.234 --> 06:29.434
and the seven chakras were described, on the right side.

06:31.133 --> 06:37.267
According to them there is bhuh, bhurvah.

06:38.033 --> 06:42.234
Bhuh is this prithivi, is this world, bhuh.

06:42.634 --> 06:48.567
Bhurvah is the complete cosmos, or we can call it antariksha.

06:49.500 --> 06:55.033
Swaha: swaha is consumption at the Nabhi Chakra;

06:55.500 --> 07:01.267
and swadha is the, swadha is the consumption inside,

07:01.300 --> 07:08.167
is to absorption – swaha, swadha.

07:09.000 --> 07:17.000
Then is the mind, heart – manah.

07:19.601 --> 07:31.033
After manah came the Agnya – the Vishuddhi.

07:31.500 --> 07:37.367
The Vishuddhi is janah, collectivity, people,

07:37.767 --> 07:42.200
go to the people – janah.

07:43.500 --> 07:48.300
Then at the Agnya it is tapah.

07:49.601 --> 07:55.100
In tapah we have Christ in the center;

07:56.500 --> 08:06.033
left side they had Jainism, right side Christianity.

08:08.367 --> 08:12.200
They were not actually ascending path,

08:13.067 --> 08:18.534
they were just side outlets, we can say,

08:19.133 --> 08:25.701
for the energy of people who were trying to seek the truth.

08:28.500 --> 08:35.167
Now this happened for ages in India.

08:35.601 --> 08:38.200
All the gurus, all the sadhus,

08:39.267 --> 08:42.234
all the big tapassvis, all of them did this.

08:42.667 --> 08:45.067
But where did they reach?

08:45.434 --> 08:50.701
Tapassvis were the people who could give curses –

08:51.067 --> 08:56.100
kshu, shapah – to people, they could curse somebody.

08:57.334 --> 09:05.300
With the kataksha, is with the glance of the eye they could kill somebody,

09:06.067 --> 09:11.167
they could burn something; all right-sided powers they had.

09:11.667 --> 09:16.667
And with these right-sided powers, where did they reach?

09:17.534 --> 09:23.434
To hell, I should say, in a way – if not, in the limbo, as you call it.

09:25.067 --> 09:28.234
There nobody got Self-realization.

09:29.467 --> 09:39.067
You read the old books from India, but even otherwise the Greeks;

09:41.167 --> 09:47.534
and then we had Egyptians, English

09:48.500 --> 09:55.167
and all kinds of aggressive people, Germans

09:55.467 --> 10:05.801
– all of them were aggressive – Catholics, and also you had Romans.

10:06.567 --> 10:08.601
All of them were aggressive,

10:09.133 --> 10:14.701
and were taking the land and property of other countries;

10:15.434 --> 10:21.300
extremely aggressive, they believed in the killing of the people -

10:24.534 --> 10:28.634
extremely, insulting, hot-tempered people.

10:29.667 --> 10:38.200
So how to bring them to the normal, to the central path?

10:41.767 --> 10:50.067
One side was, as I told you, bhuh, bhurv, swaha, swadha,

10:50.534 --> 10:55.167
it’s consumption – this was done by Guru Principle.

10:56.634 --> 11:03.067
Then we have manah, janah – that is collective.

11:03.434 --> 11:07.400
They became collective, no doubt, because they were so powerful

11:08.033 --> 11:17.367
that they had such a lot of people with them to fight for the oppressive.

11:17.767 --> 11:21.367
With their oppressive temperament they were fighting on people

11:21.367 --> 11:23.300
and were oppressing them.

11:25.067 --> 11:30.067
All this kind of … generation came in the history,

11:30.067 --> 11:33.200
as you know, and then it disappeared.

11:35.400 --> 11:43.234
Wars were created, then so many people were killed.

11:44.400 --> 11:50.067
We had Hitler as the maximum of cruelty.

11:51.067 --> 11:55.067
They never cared for humanity.

11:56.100 --> 11:59.701
Then ultimately it came to the Agnya.

12:00.367 --> 12:10.200
Agnya also they killed Jesus Christ, they destroyed Jesus Christ.

12:11.267 --> 12:15.067
They destroyed so many great saints who were really saints

12:15.167 --> 12:21.100
through the central path – some were incarnations –

12:21.400 --> 12:23.367
and they destroyed them.

12:24.801 --> 12:33.434
All this happened since the time of Rama, all that has happened.

12:35.167 --> 12:39.601
And one after another so many rakshasas came,

12:40.400 --> 12:46.067
and they destroyed the peaceful culture of the world;

12:47.500 --> 12:53.367
extremely arrogant show-offs, as we can call them,

12:54.133 --> 12:56.500
very aggressive people.

12:57.534 --> 13:06.400
And this aggression came, came with such a great force,

13:07.534 --> 13:10.067
and followed one after another.

13:13.200 --> 13:16.133
It went up to a point.

13:16.467 --> 13:24.234
When people reacted, they were killed and were destroyed.

13:30.067 --> 13:34.200
So horrible people were created;

13:41.167 --> 13:56.067
all these people, as they were aggressive and destructive.

13:59.234 --> 14:07.367
This nature is still within us, some people, because they are right-sided.

14:08.500 --> 14:19.267
All right-side people had this problem: temper, aggression, controlling others.

14:20.601 --> 14:26.200
The growth stopped, and there was no spiritual growth.

14:27.601 --> 14:30.667
They wanted to have spirituality,

14:31.300 --> 14:41.601
but with this kind of behavior they had developed, spirituality ran away.

14:43.234 --> 14:46.100
We had so many incarnations.

14:46.567 --> 14:51.400
They all were killed, crucified, or were finished.

14:53.367 --> 15:02.334
There was no possibility of saving human beings in general.

15:04.534 --> 15:07.701
One bad man came and he ruined the whole world.

15:08.634 --> 15:13.000
We had one Hitler who really hit all the people,

15:13.067 --> 15:17.734
all the countries, all the nations, and we were all finished.

15:19.200 --> 15:26.567
All this is because we have taken to right-sided movement

15:27.334 --> 15:31.334
which they thought was easier for spirituality, which was not.

15:32.467 --> 15:38.033
So they crossed all the limits, and they reached a stage

15:38.567 --> 15:45.567
that they became absolutely devils, rakshasas,

15:46.067 --> 15:50.634
without realizing that human beings are rakshasas,

15:51.534 --> 15:54.234
that's what they become.

15:57.667 --> 16:00.567
Even their gurus were like that,

16:01.300 --> 16:09.234
and nothing but they tortured even the incarnations,

16:09.567 --> 16:12.601
all the incarnations were tortured by them.

16:13.567 --> 16:18.067
It was really – how they saved themselves is remarkable,

16:18.734 --> 16:24.033
but ultimately they couldn't produce any results.

16:25.467 --> 16:32.567
So the first thing I tried was to study about the kundalini,

16:34.400 --> 16:37.500
that I should be able to raise the kundalini.

16:37.767 --> 16:40.167
And I knew I had come for that,

16:40.434 --> 16:45.267
not for anything else, but only to raise the kundalini of people

16:45.500 --> 16:52.567
so that they take to the central path, not to the right or to the left.

16:53.367 --> 16:59.467
But I told you the knowledge of the left side, plus raising your kundalini.

17:00.334 --> 17:05.434
By raising your kundalini you broke your Sahasrara,

17:06.567 --> 17:18.234
and you entered into the realm of real joy, of reality.

17:19.801 --> 17:25.400
All these bad qualities started falling out.

17:27.067 --> 17:30.200
In the central path first the Mooladhara came.

17:31.334 --> 17:35.334
By the awakening of the Mooladhara and the central path,

17:36.167 --> 17:41.067
you became very pure people.

17:41.701 --> 17:46.467
Your eyes became pure, your licentiousness went away,

17:47.067 --> 17:52.000
your cheapness went away and you became very, very –

17:56.367 --> 17:59.567
I think we should call them the holy people.

18:00.334 --> 18:05.033
Unless and until that happens you cannot be in Sahaja Yoga.

18:05.634 --> 18:10.467
You cannot be a licentious, you cannot be a flirtish,

18:10.734 --> 18:16.500
you cannot be a man who wants to grab money from others and all that,

18:17.000 --> 18:21.334
or anyone who is very aggressive could be in Sahaja Yoga.

18:22.167 --> 18:24.300
So all such people were thrown out.

18:24.567 --> 18:28.133
Once they were thrown out they were showing their teeth, I should say.

18:28.367 --> 18:31.133
They didn't like it that they were thrown out.

18:31.367 --> 18:37.033
But they understand now, some of them, that “we have made mistakes.”

18:37.367 --> 18:44.434
So first thing is that you must develop your sense of chastity,

18:45.400 --> 18:49.033
respect it and enjoy it.

18:49.500 --> 18:54.500
That happened because of your Mooladhara being awakened.

18:55.467 --> 19:03.267
That's the first chakra on the left side, where you have Shri Ganesha.

19:04.534 --> 19:08.234
But on the right side also we have deities.

19:08.367 --> 19:14.234
On every chakra we have deities to compensate,

19:15.000 --> 19:18.534
but Shri Ganesha is in the center.

19:19.567 --> 19:26.267
And that's how we were blessed by His powerful purity,

19:27.067 --> 19:31.100
and we started understanding the beauty of purity,

19:31.434 --> 19:34.234
the power of purity.

19:37.467 --> 19:42.400
That's how our right side we finished off.

19:43.067 --> 19:49.367
Right side was for fighting, for killing, anger.

19:51.567 --> 19:54.534
There was no peace for these people.

19:55.234 --> 20:02.033
The only thing they knew how to dominate others, and to be intolerable.

20:03.534 --> 20:12.033
So then they rose to a higher, to higher level of Swadisthan.

20:13.100 --> 20:17.167
In Swadisthana they rose,

20:17.601 --> 20:24.200
and the aggressiveness of the creative people to create something.

20:25.334 --> 20:27.300
Even now we have many.

20:27.500 --> 20:32.601
They create all kinds of nonsense, create all sorts of grotesque,

20:33.067 --> 20:42.500
also very, very, I should say, dirty things to make a name.

20:43.400 --> 20:47.100
So this is the another thing we got it in Swadisthana,

20:47.234 --> 20:52.133
people who wanted to have a name, a position –

20:53.367 --> 20:56.367
that came from right Swadisthana.

20:57.300 --> 21:03.601
Then the third chakra that was there was the Nabhi Chakra.

21:04.367 --> 21:08.400
On the Nabhi Chakra they went all out to make money,

21:08.467 --> 21:14.300
not Lakshmi but money, money by any means,

21:15.500 --> 21:19.300
and they cheated the whole world.

21:19.601 --> 21:27.000
With this money that they got, they did all kinds of bad things.

21:29.601 --> 21:35.400
Either they cheated or they were aggressive.

21:36.601 --> 21:43.067
Cheating was very much in the left-side countries like India,

21:44.367 --> 21:48.567
and aggressiveness in the right-side countries.

21:51.167 --> 21:58.200
In the center, what quality we have at the Swadisthana is the creativeness:

21:58.701 --> 22:02.467
creative of art, which is very beautiful,

22:02.567 --> 22:07.500
which is very deep, which is absolutely spiritual.

22:08.334 --> 22:12.234
That vanished, and people started showing

22:12.267 --> 22:16.367
even the incarnations full of dirty habits.

22:17.467 --> 22:21.567
All kinds of filth came in with that progress.

22:23.667 --> 22:26.734
Then, as I told you, there's Nabhi.

22:27.367 --> 22:35.067
In Nabhi people got after money.

22:36.701 --> 22:39.067
Left-sided people were making money,

22:39.133 --> 22:41.601
right-sided were aggressive with their money.

22:41.667 --> 22:45.334
If they were earning they thought they’re on top of the world.

22:46.167 --> 22:50.234
If they had money they thought, “Nobody is better than us.”

22:51.534 --> 22:56.734
All this finished them off, it's finishing.

22:57.167 --> 23:00.500
It will come to that point where they will realize

23:01.033 --> 23:06.234
that money is not for destroying but for construction:

23:06.767 --> 23:11.133
constructing of the country, constructing of the human beings together

23:11.300 --> 23:14.167
to bring peace and love among them,

23:15.267 --> 23:21.467
for helping, for doing all kinds of good things.

23:23.334 --> 23:34.334
Then the same right-sided people went to the chakra of the Mother,

23:36.167 --> 23:41.200
and they were horrible mothers, tried to dominate their children,

23:41.434 --> 23:48.434
dominate everyone, and could not sacrifice anything for the children.

23:49.200 --> 23:52.334
We have had enough of these women

23:52.667 --> 23:57.234
who are aggressive with their husbands, are aggressive with their children.

23:58.067 --> 24:02.400
And even the motherhood among men is dead and finished.

24:04.067 --> 24:09.067
All that kind of lot when I came on this Earth I saw,

24:09.300 --> 24:13.400
and I was shocked – what sort of human beings are those?

24:13.701 --> 24:16.100
What am I going to do with them?

24:16.467 --> 24:19.133
How will I awaken their kundalini?

24:20.067 --> 24:23.133
At the Nabhi Chakra only they were lost,

24:24.167 --> 24:27.033
but now it is the Mother's chakra.

24:27.367 --> 24:32.667
They had no fatherhood, no motherhood, they drove out their children –

24:33.367 --> 24:38.400
very selfish, self-centered, dominating parents.

24:45.067 --> 24:47.434
This was the Heart Chakra.

24:49.133 --> 24:53.334
Then came the collective chakra, what we call as the Vishuddhi.

24:54.133 --> 24:59.200
At the Vishuddhi Chakra they wanted to occupy the whole world.

25:00.267 --> 25:09.400
They wanted to occupy the whole world as their own to become emperors,

25:09.634 --> 25:14.500
and they formed empires and misbehaved to such an extent

25:15.067 --> 25:18.067
that it's not humanly possible to behave like that.

25:18.200 --> 25:20.367
They really were rakshasas, I should say,

25:20.567 --> 25:23.434
and those rakshas qualities are still there.

25:24.133 --> 25:28.267
In their behavior, in everything you can see how they behave

25:28.434 --> 25:33.100
towards people, treating them like that,

25:33.567 --> 25:40.400
creating people who are against spirituality,

25:41.067 --> 25:44.067
and those who are aggressive.

25:45.334 --> 25:49.634
Well, these became like a two-sided world

25:49.767 --> 25:54.300
where there are people who are aggressive,

25:55.067 --> 25:57.267
and the people who are tortured.

25:57.534 --> 26:07.167
This two-sided world exists even now, but is much less.

26:08.467 --> 26:12.267
Thanks to the collective understanding

26:12.334 --> 26:17.133
there are many good institution that were established

26:17.467 --> 26:22.067
but they are not working out, they are not so successful,

26:22.500 --> 26:28.300
because the men at the head of it are controlling, but controlling what?

26:28.567 --> 26:31.567
Not themselves – controlling others,

26:32.067 --> 26:37.267
and all their behavior has spoilt all the work of this chakra.

26:39.067 --> 26:43.067
Collectively you have, if you see around now today

26:43.267 --> 26:50.200
everywhere there’s war going on, fights going on, killing going on,

26:50.200 --> 26:55.567
destruction going on. How is it?

26:56.300 --> 27:01.167
There are so many spiritual people here now on this world.

27:01.500 --> 27:06.000
So the reason is, the spiritual people have become very quiet,

27:06.367 --> 27:09.434
very much enjoying their spiritual life,

27:10.167 --> 27:16.067
have become very quiet and very peaceful people.

27:16.534 --> 27:19.434
But that doesn't bring peace.

27:20.267 --> 27:25.133
You have to be dynamic and you have to bring peace in the world,

27:25.267 --> 27:27.200
you have to do something about it.

27:27.534 --> 27:30.267
We are very much satisfied with our progress,

27:30.534 --> 27:35.534
but we are not bothered as to see what is the progress others have done,

27:36.234 --> 27:39.300
how far they have gone, where can we meet them,

27:39.467 --> 27:41.234
what can we change them.

27:41.334 --> 27:43.801
At My level I can change many things,

27:44.167 --> 27:47.267
but at your level how many people have you changed?

27:47.634 --> 27:51.033
What have you done? That has to be said.

27:51.133 --> 27:55.267
Still you live with your ego, on the Agnya,

27:56.534 --> 27:59.200
and you are very happy with your peace,

27:59.334 --> 28:02.133
with everything you have got through Sahaja Yoga.

28:02.434 --> 28:06.334
This is the biggest calamity that the world is facing today,

28:06.634 --> 28:11.567
that those who are all so spiritual, those who have achieved great heights

28:11.667 --> 28:15.400
are least bothered as to what good has to be done.

28:15.767 --> 28:19.667
What they are doing is to enjoy their own spirituality,

28:20.467 --> 28:24.067
come to the puja, have more and more of it.

28:24.200 --> 28:30.334
But they have done no collective work to change people.

28:30.467 --> 28:33.300
Some of them are working, one or two,

28:33.601 --> 28:36.167
but the rest of them are having a good time

28:36.400 --> 28:40.067
enjoying themselves in such a manner

28:40.534 --> 28:46.367
that people accept them as great souls, good people, that's all.

28:47.267 --> 28:49.734
I would like you to now introspect

28:50.100 --> 28:53.133
and find out how much collective work you have done,

28:53.400 --> 28:57.634
how many people you have got – like that.

28:58.067 --> 29:00.267
With whom are you talking?

29:00.534 --> 29:03.534
How many people have you told about Sahaja Yoga?

29:04.100 --> 29:06.067
Only so many are there.

29:06.300 --> 29:11.234
Christ had only twelve disciples; they were much more dynamic than you are.

29:11.734 --> 29:14.300
So now you should take to the right side.

29:15.200 --> 29:19.067
And when you take to the right side we'll create dynamic people,

29:19.567 --> 29:28.467
not just some useless, patient, very quiet, peaceful people.

29:29.100 --> 29:31.100
This was not the aim of Sahaja Yoga.

29:31.334 --> 29:36.467
The aim of Sahaja Yoga is to change, change so many.

29:37.334 --> 29:40.567
And those who are doing that, all My blessings are with them.

29:41.167 --> 29:45.767
But those who are just keeping to themselves, it is not a very good thing.

29:46.267 --> 29:49.734
In your country how many people have got to Sahaja Yoga?

29:50.067 --> 29:54.133
Just find out. With how many people you have worked it out?

29:54.334 --> 29:59.334
So yours is not a complete yoga, yours is a partial yoga of the left side,

29:59.367 --> 30:02.534
where you are very loving, you are very kind, very this thing.

30:02.801 --> 30:05.500
I am not saying that you should become aggressive in any way.

30:06.200 --> 30:11.701
But even I have seen people want to be leaders, they want to be something great;

30:12.133 --> 30:15.067
but how many people have they given realization?

30:15.234 --> 30:18.634
How many people have they talked about Sahaja Yoga?

30:19.167 --> 30:22.167
I have said even in the aeroplane also you go,

30:22.400 --> 30:26.133
you walk in the street, anywhere people talk about Sahaja Yoga.

30:26.434 --> 30:31.100
But here we are using Sahaja Yoga for our greatness,

30:31.334 --> 30:35.667
for our understanding of ourselves.

30:36.100 --> 30:39.367
This is not why Sahaja Yoga has been brought to you.

30:40.033 --> 30:46.167
It has been brought to you for giving realizations to many people.

30:47.267 --> 30:49.334
I request all the younger people, younger generation

30:49.367 --> 30:53.067
not to waste their Sahaj energies

30:53.167 --> 30:55.434
on nonsense as the old people have done.

30:56.067 --> 30:59.200
You’d better go ahead and talk to people about Sahaja Yog,

30:59.334 --> 31:01.200
and spread the Sahaja Yoga.

31:01.500 --> 31:07.200
They are more interested in running schools, in looking after the destitute,

31:07.200 --> 31:09.400
doing this, - doing that – that's not your job.

31:09.734 --> 31:14.667
Your job is to create more Sahaja yogis, more Sahaja yoginis.

31:14.801 --> 31:19.234
But that is not there, what I find is it's not there.

31:19.567 --> 31:23.434
The right side is missing. You should come to the right side.

31:23.734 --> 31:30.033
Go all ahead. Nothing will happen to you. Nobody can kill you,

31:30.300 --> 31:34.200
nobody can disturb you, nobody can arrest you, take it from Me.

31:34.467 --> 31:39.300
You have powers but if you don't use them, you are like this.

31:40.701 --> 31:44.601
That is why we have come to the stagnated point

31:45.100 --> 31:48.200
that we should know we have to use our right side.

31:48.467 --> 31:51.267
Right side is very important.

31:52.167 --> 31:56.434
Next time I'll tell you about right side, what right-sided things you have.

31:56.567 --> 31:59.500
Now you cannot become left-sided whatever you may try;

31:59.601 --> 32:04.400
so you use your right side in the right direction

32:04.701 --> 32:11.033
with the right understanding, not as some sort of,

32:11.133 --> 32:18.434
I should say, very arbitrary or very dominating, like Hitlers.

32:19.234 --> 32:22.234
We have had also Hitlers among Sahaja yogis.

32:22.467 --> 32:25.334
But now the time has come for you

32:25.734 --> 32:29.534
to do something more than what the saints have done before,

32:30.167 --> 32:33.434
to work it out that way; not to keep to yourself

32:33.601 --> 32:38.067
that you have a family, you have very nice children,

32:38.067 --> 32:41.334
having, enjoying, all that – that's not the Sahaja Yoga for.

32:42.801 --> 32:47.634
Sahaja Yoga is for transforming the whole world.

32:48.534 --> 32:53.500
You have to think about it: what are you doing, where are you,

32:54.234 --> 32:58.200
and what have you achieved out of Sahaja Yoga?

32:58.601 --> 33:02.300
Then we come to the Agnya.

33:03.534 --> 33:08.734
In Agnya what has happened is Sahaja yogis are become, they have,

33:09.100 --> 33:15.100
they can bear anything, they can suffer anything – that's not we want.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.500
What we want, to remove the sufferings of others,

33:20.234 --> 33:22.400
remove the aggression of others.

33:22.634 --> 33:27.367
So we don't, that kind of organization we don't have,

33:28.067 --> 33:30.467
that kind of understanding we don’t have.

33:30.801 --> 33:35.434
And if that works out, you will be different people.

33:36.067 --> 33:42.367
So we have become like saints, you see, sitting in their hermit halls,

33:42.367 --> 33:47.234
something like that, not more than that.

33:48.067 --> 33:53.634
So better try to do something positive, without aggression.

33:53.801 --> 34:00.067
I know some of you are still very aggressive, are show-offs, I know that.

34:01.300 --> 34:08.567
But if you get into the mood of working out collectively,

34:09.367 --> 34:13.567
then you will realize what mistakes you have,

34:14.667 --> 34:20.534
still what is lacking in your personality – that is very important.

34:20.801 --> 34:24.567
At Agnya Chakra many Sahaja yogis falter,

34:26.133 --> 34:28.634
I don't know what happens to them.

34:29.367 --> 34:32.567
At Agnya I have told that you must forgive.

34:33.167 --> 34:37.400
But that doesn't mean that you allow people to do wrong things.

34:38.234 --> 34:41.534
Because you want to forgive it's very easy not to fight,

34:41.567 --> 34:45.500
not to say anything, just keep out, just forgive – no.

34:46.334 --> 34:53.634
You go and talk to that person and tell him it is wrong.

34:56.200 --> 34:58.100
You have to face it.

34:59.100 --> 35:04.267
If you cannot face it then you are useless, just like any other people.

35:04.767 --> 35:08.534
What's the use of you people getting your realization?

35:10.234 --> 35:15.634
So now we have to understand that it's not only that we have vibrations,

35:15.634 --> 35:18.100
that we are all right,

35:18.200 --> 35:22.367
that you can cure some people is the last word – no.

35:23.267 --> 35:26.100
You have to spread it, you have to go in the public,

35:26.200 --> 35:29.200
you have to be collective on this point

35:29.234 --> 35:30.500
and you have to spread Sahaja Yoga.

35:31.000 --> 35:37.200
With so many Sahaja yogis all over the world we have not progressed much.

35:38.100 --> 35:42.534
So now it is you have to plan what you want to do,

35:42.634 --> 35:46.267
how you want to do it, and how you want to spread Sahaja Yoga.

35:46.567 --> 35:49.567
It's very important.

35:51.067 --> 35:58.067
Because you people are good at, say, talking about Sahaja Yoga,

35:58.067 --> 36:02.534
singing about Sahaja Yoga; all these things are useless unless and until

36:02.534 --> 36:08.234
you have concrete proof of getting many more people in Sahaja Yoga.

36:09.434 --> 36:11.500
In a small country like Turkey

36:12.100 --> 36:15.634
we have 25000 Sahaja yogis, what do you say?

36:16.133 --> 36:24.033
They are all Muslims, twenty-five thousands Muslim becoming Sahaja yogis,

36:24.400 --> 36:30.067
while you find that number is very small in any other country.

36:31.200 --> 36:36.367
They are not very rich, but they care for their Self-realization

36:36.567 --> 36:39.467
and for toward giving Self-realizations to others.

36:40.067 --> 36:45.367
It's very surprising how it has worked out, how it has spread.

36:46.267 --> 36:54.634
So instead of thinking of your problems, of your enemies, of your powers,

36:55.067 --> 36:57.267
think of giving power to others

36:57.467 --> 37:01.367
and making them Sahaja Yoga – it's very important.

37:02.133 --> 37:06.267
If you are in Sahasrara then you have all the powers.

37:07.367 --> 37:10.267
In Sahasrara if you do not spread Sahaja Yoga,

37:10.467 --> 37:12.534
what's the use of getting realization?

37:12.801 --> 37:16.400
Just for yourself – it's being very selfish.

37:16.667 --> 37:25.567
So I would say that instead of spreading your own glory, your own name,

37:26.067 --> 37:29.667
please try to get more people to Sahaja Yoga.

37:30.267 --> 37:33.534
Go into a very dynamic force.

37:34.300 --> 37:36.434
So many people have complained to Me

37:37.033 --> 37:40.500
that Sahaja yogis are nothing but dead people.

37:41.534 --> 37:44.334
Is that what you are?

37:45.367 --> 37:51.334
Only single person like Me has done so much work, so why not you people?

37:52.234 --> 37:55.367
In your country have you worked it out all over?

37:56.067 --> 37:57.634
Just think about it.

37:58.167 --> 38:02.100
And that's why, unless and until you don't do it you are not sampurna,

38:02.133 --> 38:03.334
you are not complete,

38:03.567 --> 38:08.534
and the Adi Shakti's powers you have not understood in its full form.

38:09.400 --> 38:13.033
That's why I'm telling you today it's a very important day

38:13.067 --> 38:15.300
that you worship Me as Adi Shakti.

38:15.500 --> 38:19.167
But you should know that Adi Shakti has to be a complete form.

38:19.500 --> 38:22.634
It cannot be only half left-sided – no.

38:24.200 --> 38:27.434
If that doesn't work out, then what's the use?

38:27.634 --> 38:34.300
It's like any other getting any other realization – that's not so important.

38:35.300 --> 38:37.100
Not only that you should spread,

38:37.267 --> 38:41.534
but also you should make them, and realize it.

38:49.167 --> 38:54.400
All My blessings, all My love, all My powers I give you;

38:55.234 --> 38:59.534
but try to understand. All right?

39:00.200 --> 39:03.000
Thank you very much.
