WEBVTT

00:04.917 --> 00:11.667
Today we have assembled here to do the puja

00:12.125 --> 00:15.500
of the Mother Earth.

00:15.917 --> 00:21.625
We call it as the Bhoomi Puja, Shri Dhara Puja.

00:22.250 --> 00:24.500
She’s called as Dhara.

00:25.875 --> 00:28.625
As you know, “dha” means “sustain.”

00:29.625 --> 00:34.999
Ra-dha – the one who sustains the energy is Radha.

00:35.834 --> 00:40.000
And Dhara, which is

00:43.458 --> 00:47.250
the one which is sustenance itself,

00:51.959 --> 00:52.750
She sustains us.

00:57.917 --> 01:01.000
On Her we live.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.333
As you know,

01:04.208 --> 01:10.417
this Mother Earth is revolving with a tremendous speed,

01:11.709 --> 01:14.834
and but for Her gravity

01:15.417 --> 01:19.291
we would not have existed here.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.917
Apart from that,

01:23.750 --> 01:27.166
there is so much atmospheric pressure on Her.

01:33.083 --> 01:40.458
She understands, thinks, coordinates, and creates.

01:45.667 --> 01:50.417
This only you can find out when you are a realized soul.

01:52.125 --> 01:56.000
You have seen how She sucks in your negativity

01:56.000 --> 01:58.999
when you are standing on Her – bare feet,

01:59.417 --> 02:00.417
respecting Her,

02:00.667 --> 02:03.709
requesting Her to suck your negativity,

02:04.208 --> 02:10.709
with a light in front of you,

02:13.000 --> 02:16.792
in front of My photograph.

02:17.792 --> 02:20.917
She knows Me,

02:21.625 --> 02:25.834
because She’s My Mother.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.750
She’s your Grandmother, we can say;

02:31.375 --> 02:36.750
that’s why She nourishes you, She looks after you.

02:37.709 --> 02:42.417
Early in the morning when we get up,

02:43.166 --> 02:45.083
when we put our foot on Her we have to say,

02:45.458 --> 02:50.208
“Oh Mother, please forgive us

02:50.542 --> 02:53.542
we are touching You with our feet.”

02:53.959 --> 02:57.000
But doesn’t matter, children can touch the mother with

02:57.250 --> 03:03.834
the feet or with the hands – makes no difference.

03:05.250 --> 03:12.709
But She is the creator of the body of Shri Ganesh.

03:14.291 --> 03:16.792
She’s the one who is represented within us

03:17.291 --> 03:19.792
as the Kundalini.

03:20.000 --> 03:27.166
She Herself moves in a spiral round the sun.

03:28.999 --> 03:32.542
The sun also moves up and down,

03:32.999 --> 03:36.208
and She moves around the sun in a spiral;

03:37.333 --> 03:40.542
but because both are relatively moving,

03:41.083 --> 03:44.917
you don’t see the movement of the sun.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.959
The relationship between the Mother Earth and all other

03:56.125 --> 03:59.375
stars, planets, and constellations

04:00.125 --> 04:06.542
are kept constant, unvariable with great care.

04:11.625 --> 04:14.291
When we talk of materialism,

04:16.333 --> 04:21.667
we are acting against our Mother Earth.

04:25.208 --> 04:29.917
Instead of learning from Her subtler qualities,

04:30.458 --> 04:33.500
we are trying to exploit Her, to dig her out,

04:33.959 --> 04:38.125
to use Her for our selfish motives.

04:39.875 --> 04:42.999
What does She do to us?

04:43.959 --> 04:47.542
She creates these beautiful fruits for you to eat.

04:48.083 --> 04:51.417
She creates beautiful trees for you to make furniture,

04:51.875 --> 04:53.792
to make nice houses.

04:54.291 --> 04:58.834
She gives you green grass to soothe your nerves.

05:01.125 --> 05:07.041
She carries so many rivers and so many huge big oceans

05:07.625 --> 05:10.250
on Her being.

05:10.709 --> 05:14.709
She’s always larger than the largest of oceans.

05:16.999 --> 05:18.375
Such a great thing as She is,

05:19.542 --> 05:24.166
what do we do to Her is to exploit Her fully,

05:25.083 --> 05:27.291
indiscriminately.

05:27.667 --> 05:30.000
Then the reactions are set in.

05:30.375 --> 05:32.959
The beautiful cycle of nature is broken

05:32.959 --> 05:35.625
by our aggressive attitude,

05:36.834 --> 05:39.834
and absolutely indiscreet.

05:40.417 --> 05:45.750
Then this Mother Earth doesn’t do anything as such

05:46.083 --> 05:49.208
Herself, not much;

05:49.667 --> 05:52.917
but then the ether starts acting,

05:53.333 --> 05:58.917
and you have problems, what we call as acid rains,

05:59.375 --> 06:03.917
plastic, all kinds of problems that come out of this

06:04.250 --> 06:07.458
indiscreet creation.

06:08.583 --> 06:11.166
When we started making machinery,

06:11.166 --> 06:13.375
without any balance

06:15.375 --> 06:17.792
we started producing machinery,

06:20.000 --> 06:21.834
just like mad.

06:22.291 --> 06:23.166
As a result of that,

06:23.834 --> 06:27.500
now we have become slaves of machines.

06:27.999 --> 06:30.166
We can’t do anything with our own hands.

06:30.709 --> 06:35.041
Because of machines, people have become unemployed.

06:35.417 --> 06:39.083
As I’ve said many a times that machines are for us,

06:39.458 --> 06:41.667
we are not for the machines.

06:42.083 --> 06:44.542
But today the situation is very different.

06:44.917 --> 06:47.583
We are entirely into the hands of machines –

06:47.999 --> 06:51.250
again the same indiscreet behavior,

06:51.917 --> 06:55.333
again the same imbalances.

06:56.792 --> 06:59.458
Mother Earth teaches us balance.

06:59.917 --> 07:01.750
If She was not in a balance,

07:02.166 --> 07:04.375
we would have been all finished.

07:04.834 --> 07:06.875
She teaches us gravity.

07:07.291 --> 07:13.792
She teaches us how to be attractive to another person

07:14.166 --> 07:17.999
without the other person knowing about it,

07:18.291 --> 07:21.291
feeling about it.

07:22.999 --> 07:28.959
Without enslaving, without mesmerizing,

07:30.083 --> 07:37.041
without obliging, to attract and to give

07:37.458 --> 07:40.125
without expectations.

07:40.500 --> 07:43.583
Without any expectations She gives us;

07:43.917 --> 07:45.709
whether we respect Her not,

07:46.000 --> 07:47.792
whether we’ll treat Her not,

07:48.083 --> 07:49.208
we give Her.

07:49.959 --> 07:55.834
But when She gets very upset, like as in –

07:57.000 --> 08:02.834
you have heard that in Mexico She erupted out.

08:03.083 --> 08:04.417
You know what was happening in Mexico,

08:04.417 --> 08:06.166
I was telling you long time back,

08:06.959 --> 08:10.083
that they are using all kinds of black magic,

08:10.875 --> 08:14.208
they are producing all kinds of drugs.

08:15.917 --> 08:18.417
Colombia is doing the same.

08:19.291 --> 08:22.333
And if you do all these things to harm people,

08:22.750 --> 08:27.999
then She gets into volcanic conditions,

08:28.583 --> 08:32.583
and then a volcano starts bursting out.

08:34.208 --> 08:39.834
As you know, Los Angeles and all these places

08:40.375 --> 08:42.125
on the western coast of America

08:42.500 --> 08:46.000
are still in the danger of volcanoes.

08:46.458 --> 08:48.875
All kinds of gurus have gone and settled there,

08:49.250 --> 08:50.875
all kinds of black magic is on.

08:51.375 --> 08:55.250
There is witchcraft which is officially recognized.

08:55.750 --> 08:57.667
Officially they are registered.

08:57.667 --> 09:00.000
Nobody minds doing anything,

09:00.375 --> 09:02.291
because they say you have human freedom

09:02.750 --> 09:05.750
to do all kinds of devilish things.

09:06.041 --> 09:08.999
Under the name of human freedom they are doing

09:09.291 --> 09:10.834
all kinds of horrible things.

09:11.166 --> 09:13.999
As a result of that, Mother takes the respite.

09:14.208 --> 09:17.208
It is always a collective respite.

09:17.542 --> 09:21.166
It is always a collective respite, please remember this.

09:21.458 --> 09:26.917
But when Sita wanted to leave Shri Rama,

09:27.417 --> 09:31.000
She opened Herself and took Her inside Herself.

09:31.709 --> 09:34.083
That is a reception of the Mother,

09:34.458 --> 09:37.667
that is not the destruction or eruption.

09:38.083 --> 09:41.583
But the eruption harms collectively, and sometimes

09:41.834 --> 09:46.291
some innocent people are also killed in that.

09:52.166 --> 09:56.999
Death does not exist, in the divine language.

09:57.500 --> 10:00.041
Those who are dead can be reborn.

10:00.542 --> 10:05.291
But death sometimes could be used for punishing people,

10:08.208 --> 10:13.792
for destroying them, for taking them away from the scene.

10:14.250 --> 10:16.375
That’s what the Mother Earth does.

10:16.834 --> 10:26.000
Sometimes Her anger can be so great that pin-pointedly

10:26.333 --> 10:27.999
She can destroy

10:29.000 --> 10:32.999
thousands and thousands of miles of earth,

10:33.709 --> 10:39.250
destroying many people who have been extremely

10:39.834 --> 10:43.375
irreligious and uncollective.

10:43.959 --> 10:45.625
In Sahaja Yoga also,

10:46.166 --> 10:47.959
those people who are uncollective,

10:48.291 --> 10:52.041
try to be uncollective, are harmed by Her;

10:52.041 --> 10:56.333
but in a very secretive way

10:57.000 --> 10:59.500
which they must understand,

10:59.959 --> 11:03.166
or we should say, in a very subtle way.

11:04.041 --> 11:07.750
When Sahaja yogis become uncollective, saying,

11:08.125 --> 11:12.875
“This is my house, my home, this is my privacy.

11:13.166 --> 11:16.959
This is my wife, my child, my things.

11:17.208 --> 11:21.667
I cannot come to puja because I have got this problem.

11:21.999 --> 11:24.333
I cannot do this work for Sahaja Yoga because I’ve got

11:24.625 --> 11:29.834
that problem” – when they become uncollective,

11:30.208 --> 11:33.583
then in a very subtle way this Mother Earth,

11:33.959 --> 11:37.250
which is represented within us as the Kundalini,

11:37.667 --> 11:40.000
gets upset.

11:40.583 --> 11:46.041
And when She gets upset, She starts acting in a manner

11:46.875 --> 11:52.083
which can be very dangerous for people.

11:53.500 --> 11:57.875
Possessiveness is not the quality of Mother Earth,

11:58.291 --> 12:00.750
She doesn’t possess anyone.

12:00.750 --> 12:03.875
For example, if you are an Indian

12:04.125 --> 12:06.750
you can come to England, you can go anywhere,

12:06.999 --> 12:08.375
you can live anywhere.

12:08.875 --> 12:10.709
She doesn’t possess anyone as such;

12:11.083 --> 12:15.709
we only the human beings have made this world into

12:16.041 --> 12:18.041
different countries, different places –

12:18.375 --> 12:21.917
all our own ideas of stupidity.

12:22.959 --> 12:24.959
There’s only one world,

12:25.291 --> 12:27.959
there’s only one world God has created.

12:27.959 --> 12:29.500
He has not created …

12:29.999 --> 12:34.208
It’s rather awkward here. Allright now better.

12:52.083 --> 12:56.208
She has not created all these nations.

12:56.208 --> 12:59.500
Only there are ravines

13:00.417 --> 13:05.208
through which big rivers flow.

13:05.667 --> 13:09.083
Sometimes, wherever She has raised Herself,

13:09.834 --> 13:12.250
there are mountains.

13:12.667 --> 13:16.959
These are Her different dulations and different varieties,

13:17.333 --> 13:19.250
just to create beauty.

13:19.625 --> 13:22.709
Supposing the whole world was like a bald-headed

13:23.291 --> 13:27.583
gentleman, what would have happened to us?

13:27.583 --> 13:32.625
First of all, we all would have slipped out, I think!

13:33.250 --> 13:36.417
Or else, what would have happened

13:36.875 --> 13:41.291
if it was nothing but just all over the forest,

13:41.625 --> 13:44.500
or all over only the mountains,

13:44.875 --> 13:47.667
or all over just the rivers?

13:51.709 --> 13:56.375
To create the beauty She has used all these things

13:56.709 --> 14:03.875
to make us happy, to give us joy, to entertain us.

14:04.166 --> 14:07.667
She created all this beautiful stage for us.

14:08.083 --> 14:09.750
And what do we do?

14:10.166 --> 14:12.875
We have divided Her into parts,

14:13.083 --> 14:15.792
that this is my country,

14:16.208 --> 14:21.000
this is your country, this is their country.

14:21.917 --> 14:27.333
When we die, what is our country?

14:29.375 --> 14:30.750
We are all dead bodies,

14:31.125 --> 14:34.417
whether you are buried in a church or in the open,

14:34.875 --> 14:36.999
you are all in the Mother Earth.

14:37.291 --> 14:42.917
What is our country is that we are the Mother Earth.

14:43.417 --> 14:46.542
So we have to understand that this body is made

14:46.999 --> 14:49.583
out of that Mother Earth to which it has to go,

14:50.125 --> 14:52.000
and we are stupid to feel that we belong to this country

14:52.375 --> 14:54.125
or to that country.

14:54.125 --> 14:58.875
Of course, this is the greatest miracle of the maya,

14:59.333 --> 15:00.417
that people know this

15:00.999 --> 15:03.542
but still they do not want to believe it.

15:03.917 --> 15:05.792
There are so many truths they know:

15:06.125 --> 15:08.417
they are sure, they know about it,

15:08.875 --> 15:10.917
but they don’t want to believe it.

15:11.333 --> 15:14.208
Or they believe it, but they don’t want to accept it.

15:14.542 --> 15:15.834
And even if they accept it,

15:16.208 --> 15:18.917
they don’t want to know about it.

15:19.291 --> 15:23.458
It’s a funny human miracle that they know

15:23.999 --> 15:26.208
that nothing belongs to us.

15:26.667 --> 15:29.542
When we come on this Earth our hands are like this;

15:30.000 --> 15:32.999
when we go, everything is like this.

15:32.999 --> 15:36.375
Despite that, despite this understanding

15:36.792 --> 15:41.000
we still play games with ourselves, cheat ourselves,

15:41.375 --> 15:43.500
and try to believe that I am this country,

15:43.750 --> 15:48.709
I am that country, I am so great, and so that.

15:48.709 --> 15:53.583
But human beings were born in certain countries

15:54.083 --> 15:56.667
earlier than in other countries.

15:57.083 --> 15:59.917
That has definitely made difference to the tradition and

16:00.208 --> 16:03.792
understanding of life, that is human life.

16:04.125 --> 16:08.166
Art remains the same, but this changes.

16:08.917 --> 16:11.834
The climate may be different,

16:12.166 --> 16:15.041
that’s why the fruits may be different.

16:15.542 --> 16:17.375
It’s all an adjustment.

16:17.709 --> 16:21.083
In the whole plan there is such a good adjustment,

16:21.500 --> 16:25.208
no quarrel, no problem; it’s just a variety again.

16:25.208 --> 16:29.083
Supposing all bananas are produced all over the world,

16:29.542 --> 16:30.500
who would care for them?

16:30.999 --> 16:33.291
For example, if you give bananas to Indians,

16:33.667 --> 16:36.999
they will laugh at it. But if you give them apples,

16:37.333 --> 16:41.208
they’ll say, “Oh, apples, wait!”

16:41.667 --> 16:44.000
The other way round for the English:

16:44.250 --> 16:46.333
if you want to give somebody present as an apple,

16:46.667 --> 16:52.250
they’ll look at you, “What’s the matter with this person?”

16:53.999 --> 16:58.208
So this is again Her own style of playing

16:58.959 --> 17:00.792
and giving you different type of climates,

17:01.083 --> 17:02.667
different type of produces,

17:03.041 --> 17:04.542
so that you enjoy different things.

17:05.083 --> 17:08.291
If there is no variety, then you won’t be able to enjoy it.

17:08.709 --> 17:10.000
How much She understand you,

17:10.333 --> 17:13.542
and how much do we understand Her?

17:14.208 --> 17:16.917
For a Sahaja yogi it is important to understand

17:17.333 --> 17:19.999
that we are not going to take anything from here.

17:20.375 --> 17:23.375
It’s all nothing but clay.

17:23.959 --> 17:27.250
And clay is going to remain here, and is going to vanish

17:28.000 --> 17:31.750
for ever and ever.

17:32.625 --> 17:34.875
What are we going to carry with us?

17:35.291 --> 17:38.125
What are we going to have with us?

17:38.625 --> 17:43.750
All the time it’s our evolution, is now our spirit.

17:43.750 --> 17:46.333
So we are the spirit:

17:46.750 --> 17:49.250
we are neither this nor that, nor that.

17:49.709 --> 17:50.959
What we are, we are the spirit,

17:51.583 --> 17:54.750
and we are absolutely not

17:55.166 --> 18:01.999
any way contaminated by anything that is called matter.

18:01.999 --> 18:05.250
So we should see to the essence of the Mother Earth,

18:05.667 --> 18:10.166
that the Mother Earth uses Her matter

18:10.583 --> 18:13.583
to give joy to others.

18:13.959 --> 18:23.208
In the same way if we use Her to give joy to others,

18:23.792 --> 18:27.166
then you have followed Her path.

18:27.542 --> 18:35.999
On the contrary if you try to exploit Her,

18:36.417 --> 18:44.208
it’s like making holes or digging at Her,

18:44.458 --> 18:46.583
who is your mother.

18:46.583 --> 18:49.709
If you try to separate Her into parts,

18:50.166 --> 18:56.291
that means you are cutting Her body into different parts.

18:56.875 --> 19:01.750
All these human concepts are anti-mother.

19:02.041 --> 19:06.875
But the worst, and worst of all is that

19:07.375 --> 19:11.667
we do not respect Shri Ganesha within us,

19:12.083 --> 19:15.500
which is the creation of this Mother Earth.

19:15.999 --> 19:18.667
Shri Ganesha which is the innocence within us,

19:19.166 --> 19:20.083
we do not respect.

19:20.750 --> 19:24.583
We did not respect the innocence that has come to us.

19:25.083 --> 19:29.709
The way children are tortured and butchered and abused

19:29.709 --> 19:32.959
is amazing: how people are not afraid

19:33.375 --> 19:37.250
one day a big volcano might break into a country like this,

19:37.709 --> 19:40.625
where the children are treated like this?

19:41.000 --> 19:43.291
In that case the Mother Earth will destroy

19:43.625 --> 19:45.959
all the human beings who are behaving like this,

19:46.375 --> 19:48.999
and She’ll take all such sweet children into Her lap,

19:49.500 --> 19:53.417
and She’ll reproduce them somewhere else.

19:55.458 --> 19:59.750
It is very important to understand that unless and until

19:59.750 --> 20:02.166
we respect Shri Ganesha within us,

20:02.667 --> 20:06.500
our innocence, our chastity,

20:07.166 --> 20:15.542
we cannot allow ourselves to call Sahaja yogis.

20:18.125 --> 20:21.375
That is the first beginning,

20:22.083 --> 20:28.500
the first step towards our ascent.

20:29.125 --> 20:34.792
We cannot talk of anything else, unless and until

20:35.250 --> 20:41.000
this foundation is laid in the Mother Earth.

20:41.792 --> 20:46.500
That is why today I have decided

20:47.375 --> 20:52.041
that we should have a Bhoomi Puja in England.

20:52.959 --> 21:00.500
I hope by this, innocence in this country will be respected,

21:00.999 --> 21:06.875
will be loved, will be protected and will be nourished.

21:07.417 --> 21:14.417
By this, innocence in grown-up people will be awakened,

21:14.417 --> 21:17.041
that they will respect their innocence,

21:17.417 --> 21:23.041
respect their chastity above all other things.

21:23.999 --> 21:26.667
By this Bhoomi Puja we respect

21:27.083 --> 21:28.709
the essence of the Mother Earth

21:29.208 --> 21:30.917
that is the Kundalini within us,

21:31.208 --> 21:36.250
and we respect our Self-realization by that.

21:36.250 --> 21:42.792
I hope what I am going to do today may

21:43.208 --> 21:48.959
be able to transform this country into its real form

21:49.458 --> 21:54.834
that I call as the Heart of the Universe.

21:54.834 --> 22:02.500
By this, I hope the Mother Earth will melt

22:02.959 --> 22:12.000
the stone hearts of this country into beautiful lotuses,

22:12.542 --> 22:18.834
into fragrant flowers of daises all around.

22:19.250 --> 22:20.125
May God bless you.

22:25.041 --> 22:28.041
Today’s puja is going to be very small,

22:28.583 --> 22:31.959
and we are not going to have a very long puja.

22:32.417 --> 22:36.709
It’s just going to be Shri Ganesha’s Puja,

22:37.041 --> 22:41.166
and Gauri’s Puja, it’s not going to be a very long puja.

22:41.500 --> 22:46.083
Only thing is that today with full attention,

22:46.083 --> 22:49.875
you all should sit down with left hand towards Me

22:50.166 --> 22:53.166
and right hand on the Mother Earth;

22:53.750 --> 22:56.709
on the Mother Earth, right hand on the Mother Earth.

22:57.291 --> 22:58.917
If you are sitting on the chairs,

22:59.208 --> 23:00.333
you can put the left hand towards Me

23:00.333 --> 23:03.083
and right hand towards the Mother Earth.
