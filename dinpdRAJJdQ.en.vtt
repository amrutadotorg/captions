00:00:04.917 --> 00:00:11.667
Today we have assembled here to do the puja

00:00:12.125 --> 00:00:15.500
of the Mother Earth.

00:00:15.917 --> 00:00:21.625
We call it as the Bhoomi Puja, Shri Dhara Puja.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.500
She’s called as Dhara.

00:00:25.875 --> 00:00:28.625
As you know, “dha” means “sustain.”

00:00:29.625 --> 00:00:34.999
Ra-dha – the one who sustains the energy is Radha.

00:00:35.834 --> 00:00:40.000
And Dhara, which is

00:00:43.458 --> 00:00:47.250
the one which is sustenance itself,

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:52.750
She sustains us.

00:00:57.917 --> 00:01:01.000
On Her we live.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.333
As you know,

00:01:04.208 --> 00:01:10.417
this Mother Earth is revolving with a tremendous speed,

00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:14.834
and but for Her gravity

00:01:15.417 --> 00:01:19.291
we would not have existed here.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.917
Apart from that,

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.166
there is so much atmospheric pressure on Her.

00:01:33.083 --> 00:01:40.458
She understands, thinks, coordinates, and creates.

00:01:45.667 --> 00:01:50.417
This only you can find out when you are a realized soul.

00:01:52.125 --> 00:01:56.000
You have seen how She sucks in your negativity

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.999
when you are standing on Her – bare feet,

00:01:59.417 --> 00:02:00.417
respecting Her,

00:02:00.667 --> 00:02:03.709
requesting Her to suck your negativity,

00:02:04.208 --> 00:02:10.709
with a light in front of you,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.792
in front of My photograph.

00:02:17.792 --> 00:02:20.917
She knows Me,

00:02:21.625 --> 00:02:25.834
because She’s My Mother.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.750
She’s your Grandmother, we can say;

00:02:31.375 --> 00:02:36.750
that’s why She nourishes you, She looks after you.

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.417
Early in the morning when we get up,

00:02:43.166 --> 00:02:45.083
when we put our foot on Her we have to say,

00:02:45.458 --> 00:02:50.208
“Oh Mother, please forgive us

00:02:50.542 --> 00:02:53.542
we are touching You with our feet.”

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.000
But doesn’t matter, children can touch the mother with

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.834
the feet or with the hands – makes no difference.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:12.709
But She is the creator of the body of Shri Ganesh.

00:03:14.291 --> 00:03:16.792
She’s the one who is represented within us

00:03:17.291 --> 00:03:19.792
as the Kundalini.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.166
She Herself moves in a spiral round the sun.

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:32.542
The sun also moves up and down,

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:36.208
and She moves around the sun in a spiral;

00:03:37.333 --> 00:03:40.542
but because both are relatively moving,

00:03:41.083 --> 00:03:44.917
you don’t see the movement of the sun.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.959
The relationship between the Mother Earth and all other

00:03:56.125 --> 00:03:59.375
stars, planets, and constellations

00:04:00.125 --> 00:04:06.542
are kept constant, unvariable with great care.

00:04:11.625 --> 00:04:14.291
When we talk of materialism,

00:04:16.333 --> 00:04:21.667
we are acting against our Mother Earth.

00:04:25.208 --> 00:04:29.917
Instead of learning from Her subtler qualities,

00:04:30.458 --> 00:04:33.500
we are trying to exploit Her, to dig her out,

00:04:33.959 --> 00:04:38.125
to use Her for our selfish motives.

00:04:39.875 --> 00:04:42.999
What does She do to us?

00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:47.542
She creates these beautiful fruits for you to eat.

00:04:48.083 --> 00:04:51.417
She creates beautiful trees for you to make furniture,

00:04:51.875 --> 00:04:53.792
to make nice houses.

00:04:54.291 --> 00:04:58.834
She gives you green grass to soothe your nerves.

00:05:01.125 --> 00:05:07.041
She carries so many rivers and so many huge big oceans

00:05:07.625 --> 00:05:10.250
on Her being.

00:05:10.709 --> 00:05:14.709
She’s always larger than the largest of oceans.

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:18.375
Such a great thing as She is,

00:05:19.542 --> 00:05:24.166
what do we do to Her is to exploit Her fully,

00:05:25.083 --> 00:05:27.291
indiscriminately.

00:05:27.667 --> 00:05:30.000
Then the reactions are set in.

00:05:30.375 --> 00:05:32.959
The beautiful cycle of nature is broken

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:35.625
by our aggressive attitude,

00:05:36.834 --> 00:05:39.834
and absolutely indiscreet.

00:05:40.417 --> 00:05:45.750
Then this Mother Earth doesn’t do anything as such

00:05:46.083 --> 00:05:49.208
Herself, not much;

00:05:49.667 --> 00:05:52.917
but then the ether starts acting,

00:05:53.333 --> 00:05:58.917
and you have problems, what we call as acid rains,

00:05:59.375 --> 00:06:03.917
plastic, all kinds of problems that come out of this

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.458
indiscreet creation.

00:06:08.583 --> 00:06:11.166
When we started making machinery,

00:06:11.166 --> 00:06:13.375
without any balance

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:17.792
we started producing machinery,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.834
just like mad.

00:06:22.291 --> 00:06:23.166
As a result of that,

00:06:23.834 --> 00:06:27.500
now we have become slaves of machines.

00:06:27.999 --> 00:06:30.166
We can’t do anything with our own hands.

00:06:30.709 --> 00:06:35.041
Because of machines, people have become unemployed.

00:06:35.417 --> 00:06:39.083
As I’ve said many a times that machines are for us,

00:06:39.458 --> 00:06:41.667
we are not for the machines.

00:06:42.083 --> 00:06:44.542
But today the situation is very different.

00:06:44.917 --> 00:06:47.583
We are entirely into the hands of machines –

00:06:47.999 --> 00:06:51.250
again the same indiscreet behavior,

00:06:51.917 --> 00:06:55.333
again the same imbalances.

00:06:56.792 --> 00:06:59.458
Mother Earth teaches us balance.

00:06:59.917 --> 00:07:01.750
If She was not in a balance,

00:07:02.166 --> 00:07:04.375
we would have been all finished.

00:07:04.834 --> 00:07:06.875
She teaches us gravity.

00:07:07.291 --> 00:07:13.792
She teaches us how to be attractive to another person

00:07:14.166 --> 00:07:17.999
without the other person knowing about it,

00:07:18.291 --> 00:07:21.291
feeling about it.

00:07:22.999 --> 00:07:28.959
Without enslaving, without mesmerizing,

00:07:30.083 --> 00:07:37.041
without obliging, to attract and to give

00:07:37.458 --> 00:07:40.125
without expectations.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.583
Without any expectations She gives us;

00:07:43.917 --> 00:07:45.709
whether we respect Her not,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.792
whether we’ll treat Her not,

00:07:48.083 --> 00:07:49.208
we give Her.

00:07:49.959 --> 00:07:55.834
But when She gets very upset, like as in –

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.834
you have heard that in Mexico She erupted out.

00:08:03.083 --> 00:08:04.417
You know what was happening in Mexico,

00:08:04.417 --> 00:08:06.166
I was telling you long time back,

00:08:06.959 --> 00:08:10.083
that they are using all kinds of black magic,

00:08:10.875 --> 00:08:14.208
they are producing all kinds of drugs.

00:08:15.917 --> 00:08:18.417
Colombia is doing the same.

00:08:19.291 --> 00:08:22.333
And if you do all these things to harm people,

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:27.999
then She gets into volcanic conditions,

00:08:28.583 --> 00:08:32.583
and then a volcano starts bursting out.

00:08:34.208 --> 00:08:39.834
As you know, Los Angeles and all these places

00:08:40.375 --> 00:08:42.125
on the western coast of America

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:46.000
are still in the danger of volcanoes.

00:08:46.458 --> 00:08:48.875
All kinds of gurus have gone and settled there,

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:50.875
all kinds of black magic is on.

00:08:51.375 --> 00:08:55.250
There is witchcraft which is officially recognized.

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:57.667
Officially they are registered.

00:08:57.667 --> 00:09:00.000
Nobody minds doing anything,

00:09:00.375 --> 00:09:02.291
because they say you have human freedom

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:05.750
to do all kinds of devilish things.

00:09:06.041 --> 00:09:08.999
Under the name of human freedom they are doing

00:09:09.291 --> 00:09:10.834
all kinds of horrible things.

00:09:11.166 --> 00:09:13.999
As a result of that, Mother takes the respite.

00:09:14.208 --> 00:09:17.208
It is always a collective respite.

00:09:17.542 --> 00:09:21.166
It is always a collective respite, please remember this.

00:09:21.458 --> 00:09:26.917
But when Sita wanted to leave Shri Rama,

00:09:27.417 --> 00:09:31.000
She opened Herself and took Her inside Herself.

00:09:31.709 --> 00:09:34.083
That is a reception of the Mother,

00:09:34.458 --> 00:09:37.667
that is not the destruction or eruption.

00:09:38.083 --> 00:09:41.583
But the eruption harms collectively, and sometimes

00:09:41.834 --> 00:09:46.291
some innocent people are also killed in that.

00:09:52.166 --> 00:09:56.999
Death does not exist, in the divine language.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:00.041
Those who are dead can be reborn.

00:10:00.542 --> 00:10:05.291
But death sometimes could be used for punishing people,

00:10:08.208 --> 00:10:13.792
for destroying them, for taking them away from the scene.

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:16.375
That’s what the Mother Earth does.

00:10:16.834 --> 00:10:26.000
Sometimes Her anger can be so great that pin-pointedly

00:10:26.333 --> 00:10:27.999
She can destroy

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.999
thousands and thousands of miles of earth,

00:10:33.709 --> 00:10:39.250
destroying many people who have been extremely

00:10:39.834 --> 00:10:43.375
irreligious and uncollective.

00:10:43.959 --> 00:10:45.625
In Sahaja Yoga also,

00:10:46.166 --> 00:10:47.959
those people who are uncollective,

00:10:48.291 --> 00:10:52.041
try to be uncollective, are harmed by Her;

00:10:52.041 --> 00:10:56.333
but in a very secretive way

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.500
which they must understand,

00:10:59.959 --> 00:11:03.166
or we should say, in a very subtle way.

00:11:04.041 --> 00:11:07.750
When Sahaja yogis become uncollective, saying,

00:11:08.125 --> 00:11:12.875
“This is my house, my home, this is my privacy.

00:11:13.166 --> 00:11:16.959
This is my wife, my child, my things.

00:11:17.208 --> 00:11:21.667
I cannot come to puja because I have got this problem.

00:11:21.999 --> 00:11:24.333
I cannot do this work for Sahaja Yoga because I’ve got

00:11:24.625 --> 00:11:29.834
that problem” – when they become uncollective,

00:11:30.208 --> 00:11:33.583
then in a very subtle way this Mother Earth,

00:11:33.959 --> 00:11:37.250
which is represented within us as the Kundalini,

00:11:37.667 --> 00:11:40.000
gets upset.

00:11:40.583 --> 00:11:46.041
And when She gets upset, She starts acting in a manner

00:11:46.875 --> 00:11:52.083
which can be very dangerous for people.

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:57.875
Possessiveness is not the quality of Mother Earth,

00:11:58.291 --> 00:12:00.750
She doesn’t possess anyone.

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:03.875
For example, if you are an Indian

00:12:04.125 --> 00:12:06.750
you can come to England, you can go anywhere,

00:12:06.999 --> 00:12:08.375
you can live anywhere.

00:12:08.875 --> 00:12:10.709
She doesn’t possess anyone as such;

00:12:11.083 --> 00:12:15.709
we only the human beings have made this world into

00:12:16.041 --> 00:12:18.041
different countries, different places –

00:12:18.375 --> 00:12:21.917
all our own ideas of stupidity.

00:12:22.959 --> 00:12:24.959
There’s only one world,

00:12:25.291 --> 00:12:27.959
there’s only one world God has created.

00:12:27.959 --> 00:12:29.500
He has not created …

00:12:29.999 --> 00:12:34.208
It’s rather awkward here. Allright now better.

00:12:52.083 --> 00:12:56.208
She has not created all these nations.

00:12:56.208 --> 00:12:59.500
Only there are ravines

00:13:00.417 --> 00:13:05.208
through which big rivers flow.

00:13:05.667 --> 00:13:09.083
Sometimes, wherever She has raised Herself,

00:13:09.834 --> 00:13:12.250
there are mountains.

00:13:12.667 --> 00:13:16.959
These are Her different dulations and different varieties,

00:13:17.333 --> 00:13:19.250
just to create beauty.

00:13:19.625 --> 00:13:22.709
Supposing the whole world was like a bald-headed

00:13:23.291 --> 00:13:27.583
gentleman, what would have happened to us?

00:13:27.583 --> 00:13:32.625
First of all, we all would have slipped out, I think!

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:36.417
Or else, what would have happened

00:13:36.875 --> 00:13:41.291
if it was nothing but just all over the forest,

00:13:41.625 --> 00:13:44.500
or all over only the mountains,

00:13:44.875 --> 00:13:47.667
or all over just the rivers?

00:13:51.709 --> 00:13:56.375
To create the beauty She has used all these things

00:13:56.709 --> 00:14:03.875
to make us happy, to give us joy, to entertain us.

00:14:04.166 --> 00:14:07.667
She created all this beautiful stage for us.

00:14:08.083 --> 00:14:09.750
And what do we do?

00:14:10.166 --> 00:14:12.875
We have divided Her into parts,

00:14:13.083 --> 00:14:15.792
that this is my country,

00:14:16.208 --> 00:14:21.000
this is your country, this is their country.

00:14:21.917 --> 00:14:27.333
When we die, what is our country?

00:14:29.375 --> 00:14:30.750
We are all dead bodies,

00:14:31.125 --> 00:14:34.417
whether you are buried in a church or in the open,

00:14:34.875 --> 00:14:36.999
you are all in the Mother Earth.

00:14:37.291 --> 00:14:42.917
What is our country is that we are the Mother Earth.

00:14:43.417 --> 00:14:46.542
So we have to understand that this body is made

00:14:46.999 --> 00:14:49.583
out of that Mother Earth to which it has to go,

00:14:50.125 --> 00:14:52.000
and we are stupid to feel that we belong to this country

00:14:52.375 --> 00:14:54.125
or to that country.

00:14:54.125 --> 00:14:58.875
Of course, this is the greatest miracle of the maya,

00:14:59.333 --> 00:15:00.417
that people know this

00:15:00.999 --> 00:15:03.542
but still they do not want to believe it.

00:15:03.917 --> 00:15:05.792
There are so many truths they know:

00:15:06.125 --> 00:15:08.417
they are sure, they know about it,

00:15:08.875 --> 00:15:10.917
but they don’t want to believe it.

00:15:11.333 --> 00:15:14.208
Or they believe it, but they don’t want to accept it.

00:15:14.542 --> 00:15:15.834
And even if they accept it,

00:15:16.208 --> 00:15:18.917
they don’t want to know about it.

00:15:19.291 --> 00:15:23.458
It’s a funny human miracle that they know

00:15:23.999 --> 00:15:26.208
that nothing belongs to us.

00:15:26.667 --> 00:15:29.542
When we come on this Earth our hands are like this;

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.999
when we go, everything is like this.

00:15:32.999 --> 00:15:36.375
Despite that, despite this understanding

00:15:36.792 --> 00:15:41.000
we still play games with ourselves, cheat ourselves,

00:15:41.375 --> 00:15:43.500
and try to believe that I am this country,

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:48.709
I am that country, I am so great, and so that.

00:15:48.709 --> 00:15:53.583
But human beings were born in certain countries

00:15:54.083 --> 00:15:56.667
earlier than in other countries.

00:15:57.083 --> 00:15:59.917
That has definitely made difference to the tradition and

00:16:00.208 --> 00:16:03.792
understanding of life, that is human life.

00:16:04.125 --> 00:16:08.166
Art remains the same, but this changes.

00:16:08.917 --> 00:16:11.834
The climate may be different,

00:16:12.166 --> 00:16:15.041
that’s why the fruits may be different.

00:16:15.542 --> 00:16:17.375
It’s all an adjustment.

00:16:17.709 --> 00:16:21.083
In the whole plan there is such a good adjustment,

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:25.208
no quarrel, no problem; it’s just a variety again.

00:16:25.208 --> 00:16:29.083
Supposing all bananas are produced all over the world,

00:16:29.542 --> 00:16:30.500
who would care for them?

00:16:30.999 --> 00:16:33.291
For example, if you give bananas to Indians,

00:16:33.667 --> 00:16:36.999
they will laugh at it. But if you give them apples,

00:16:37.333 --> 00:16:41.208
they’ll say, “Oh, apples, wait!”

00:16:41.667 --> 00:16:44.000
The other way round for the English:

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:46.333
if you want to give somebody present as an apple,

00:16:46.667 --> 00:16:52.250
they’ll look at you, “What’s the matter with this person?”

00:16:53.999 --> 00:16:58.208
So this is again Her own style of playing

00:16:58.959 --> 00:17:00.792
and giving you different type of climates,

00:17:01.083 --> 00:17:02.667
different type of produces,

00:17:03.041 --> 00:17:04.542
so that you enjoy different things.

00:17:05.083 --> 00:17:08.291
If there is no variety, then you won’t be able to enjoy it.

00:17:08.709 --> 00:17:10.000
How much She understand you,

00:17:10.333 --> 00:17:13.542
and how much do we understand Her?

00:17:14.208 --> 00:17:16.917
For a Sahaja yogi it is important to understand

00:17:17.333 --> 00:17:19.999
that we are not going to take anything from here.

00:17:20.375 --> 00:17:23.375
It’s all nothing but clay.

00:17:23.959 --> 00:17:27.250
And clay is going to remain here, and is going to vanish

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.750
for ever and ever.

00:17:32.625 --> 00:17:34.875
What are we going to carry with us?

00:17:35.291 --> 00:17:38.125
What are we going to have with us?

00:17:38.625 --> 00:17:43.750
All the time it’s our evolution, is now our spirit.

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:46.333
So we are the spirit:

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:49.250
we are neither this nor that, nor that.

00:17:49.709 --> 00:17:50.959
What we are, we are the spirit,

00:17:51.583 --> 00:17:54.750
and we are absolutely not

00:17:55.166 --> 00:18:01.999
any way contaminated by anything that is called matter.

00:18:01.999 --> 00:18:05.250
So we should see to the essence of the Mother Earth,

00:18:05.667 --> 00:18:10.166
that the Mother Earth uses Her matter

00:18:10.583 --> 00:18:13.583
to give joy to others.

00:18:13.959 --> 00:18:23.208
In the same way if we use Her to give joy to others,

00:18:23.792 --> 00:18:27.166
then you have followed Her path.

00:18:27.542 --> 00:18:35.999
On the contrary if you try to exploit Her,

00:18:36.417 --> 00:18:44.208
it’s like making holes or digging at Her,

00:18:44.458 --> 00:18:46.583
who is your mother.

00:18:46.583 --> 00:18:49.709
If you try to separate Her into parts,

00:18:50.166 --> 00:18:56.291
that means you are cutting Her body into different parts.

00:18:56.875 --> 00:19:01.750
All these human concepts are anti-mother.

00:19:02.041 --> 00:19:06.875
But the worst, and worst of all is that

00:19:07.375 --> 00:19:11.667
we do not respect Shri Ganesha within us,

00:19:12.083 --> 00:19:15.500
which is the creation of this Mother Earth.

00:19:15.999 --> 00:19:18.667
Shri Ganesha which is the innocence within us,

00:19:19.166 --> 00:19:20.083
we do not respect.

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:24.583
We did not respect the innocence that has come to us.

00:19:25.083 --> 00:19:29.709
The way children are tortured and butchered and abused

00:19:29.709 --> 00:19:32.959
is amazing: how people are not afraid

00:19:33.375 --> 00:19:37.250
one day a big volcano might break into a country like this,

00:19:37.709 --> 00:19:40.625
where the children are treated like this?

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.291
In that case the Mother Earth will destroy

00:19:43.625 --> 00:19:45.959
all the human beings who are behaving like this,

00:19:46.375 --> 00:19:48.999
and She’ll take all such sweet children into Her lap,

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:53.417
and She’ll reproduce them somewhere else.

00:19:55.458 --> 00:19:59.750
It is very important to understand that unless and until

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:02.166
we respect Shri Ganesha within us,

00:20:02.667 --> 00:20:06.500
our innocence, our chastity,

00:20:07.166 --> 00:20:15.542
we cannot allow ourselves to call Sahaja yogis.

00:20:18.125 --> 00:20:21.375
That is the first beginning,

00:20:22.083 --> 00:20:28.500
the first step towards our ascent.

00:20:29.125 --> 00:20:34.792
We cannot talk of anything else, unless and until

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:41.000
this foundation is laid in the Mother Earth.

00:20:41.792 --> 00:20:46.500
That is why today I have decided

00:20:47.375 --> 00:20:52.041
that we should have a Bhoomi Puja in England.

00:20:52.959 --> 00:21:00.500
I hope by this, innocence in this country will be respected,

00:21:00.999 --> 00:21:06.875
will be loved, will be protected and will be nourished.

00:21:07.417 --> 00:21:14.417
By this, innocence in grown-up people will be awakened,

00:21:14.417 --> 00:21:17.041
that they will respect their innocence,

00:21:17.417 --> 00:21:23.041
respect their chastity above all other things.

00:21:23.999 --> 00:21:26.667
By this Bhoomi Puja we respect

00:21:27.083 --> 00:21:28.709
the essence of the Mother Earth

00:21:29.208 --> 00:21:30.917
that is the Kundalini within us,

00:21:31.208 --> 00:21:36.250
and we respect our Self-realization by that.

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:42.792
I hope what I am going to do today may

00:21:43.208 --> 00:21:48.959
be able to transform this country into its real form

00:21:49.458 --> 00:21:54.834
that I call as the Heart of the Universe.

00:21:54.834 --> 00:22:02.500
By this, I hope the Mother Earth will melt

00:22:02.959 --> 00:22:12.000
the stone hearts of this country into beautiful lotuses,

00:22:12.542 --> 00:22:18.834
into fragrant flowers of daises all around.

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:20.125
May God bless you.

00:22:25.041 --> 00:22:28.041
Today’s puja is going to be very small,

00:22:28.583 --> 00:22:31.959
and we are not going to have a very long puja.

00:22:32.417 --> 00:22:36.709
It’s just going to be Shri Ganesha’s Puja,

00:22:37.041 --> 00:22:41.166
and Gauri’s Puja, it’s not going to be a very long puja.

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:46.083
Only thing is that today with full attention,

00:22:46.083 --> 00:22:49.875
you all should sit down with left hand towards Me

00:22:50.166 --> 00:22:53.166
and right hand on the Mother Earth;

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:56.709
on the Mother Earth, right hand on the Mother Earth.

00:22:57.291 --> 00:22:58.917
If you are sitting on the chairs,

00:22:59.208 --> 00:23:00.333
you can put the left hand towards Me

00:23:00.333 --> 00:23:03.083
and right hand towards the Mother Earth.
