00:00.001 --> 00:04.420
Shri Ganesha Puja. Nasik (India), 18 January 1983.

00:07.157 --> 00:10.557
It is such a fortunate day today,

00:10.757 --> 00:15.557
that we should come on the birth of Shri Ganesha

00:15.757 --> 00:18.437
– today is Vinayak Chaturthi, today -

00:18.717 --> 00:23.757
that we should celebrate this Puja.

00:26.917 --> 00:29.397
Also, it is so fortunate to have people like

00:29.637 --> 00:35.517
Dr Sanghvi, his wife and his son, his daughter-in-law,

00:36.437 --> 00:41.037
who are so much dedicated to Sahaja Yoga.

00:43.597 --> 00:47.957
In 1972 I had visited Pune, Nasik,

00:48.157 --> 00:51.797
and we had a big session here.

00:52.077 --> 00:56.717
People from all over came; we got a lot of Sahaja yogis here.

00:57.037 --> 00:59.397
Raulbai is one of them.

00:59.637 --> 01:05.317
But the people of Nasik did not come forward much to do Sahaja Yoga,

01:05.637 --> 01:09.797
and sort of, we didn’t find any

01:11.117 --> 01:16.157
footing place here, so we gave up coming to Nasik.

01:16.397 --> 01:21.277
And today after so many days, now I’m back here.

01:22.157 --> 01:27.997
And it’s so surprising how we have been able to manage.

01:29.997 --> 01:31.637
So many people yesterday, about,

01:31.837 --> 01:35.677
they are saying about ten thousand people were present.

01:35.877 --> 01:38.397
And at least, I would say that ninety percent people

01:38.637 --> 01:42.637
got Realization, at least.

01:44.077 --> 01:49.917
Now, I have to say that the quality of people is very important,

01:50.517 --> 01:55.957
and in Maharashtra you must understand that there’s a quality.

01:56.237 --> 02:00.797
These people have a special quality of purity, I think,

02:01.037 --> 02:03.517
that invariably

02:03.757 --> 02:06.997
I’ve seen the amount of working it takes place in Maharashtra,

02:07.197 --> 02:10.357
doesn’t take place in other place.

02:11.317 --> 02:14.317
Perhaps the people are very much aware

02:14.557 --> 02:18.317
of the three and a half peethas they have here.

02:18.597 --> 02:24.037
Now for, they are Jains and have been following Jainism but

02:24.237 --> 02:27.637
still they always worshipped the Goddess, the Devi.

02:27.877 --> 02:33.077
So, we can understand that what is an impact

02:33.277 --> 02:37.117
of those three and a half peethas is.

02:37.437 --> 02:39.317
And you have visited

02:39.597 --> 02:44.757
the great shrine of Chaturshringi.

02:46.397 --> 02:47.237
Saptashringi.

02:47.437 --> 02:50.957
I’m sorry, Saptashringi. [Hindi/Marathi]

02:51.197 --> 02:52.917
Today being Ganesha’s day,

02:53.117 --> 02:56.317
only it is going to come "chatura" in My mouth.

02:56.757 --> 02:58.597
So this Saptashringi is the one

02:58.797 --> 03:02.357
who has got seven chakras, means the limbic area,

03:02.597 --> 03:05.517
and She is the Sahasrara, representing the Sahasrara.

03:05.757 --> 03:09.357
That’s why she’s the Ardha-Matra.

03:09.917 --> 03:13.677
And Her face and body and all that you can see,

03:13.917 --> 03:16.437
is so beautifully made,

03:16.677 --> 03:21.557
that it emits vibrations for miles together.

03:21.797 --> 03:25.077
Those who are sensitive can feel it.

03:26.557 --> 03:31.597
And you have been so lucky to go there and see that

03:31.877 --> 03:35.677
miraculous place, that this have come out of Mother Earth.

03:36.077 --> 03:37.917
And since ancient times it has been there.

03:38.117 --> 03:41.637
Nobody knows when it appeared.

03:44.117 --> 03:47.077
So we are in a very holy place,

03:47.237 --> 03:53.117
because as you know Sita lived here for so many years

03:53.357 --> 03:58.397
and Shri Rama was also with Her, and also Shri Lakshmana.

03:58.677 --> 04:04.317
So it is obvious that this is a big kind of,

04:04.557 --> 04:06.957
we can say a,

04:07.197 --> 04:11.877
quite a big meeting place of various holy things,

04:12.077 --> 04:17.957
that happened during the different periods of Maharashtra.

04:19.637 --> 04:25.437
And the River Godavari also flows and the, also the

04:27.557 --> 04:31.837
[Hindi/Marathi] source, source of this river is also very near.

04:32.037 --> 04:33.877
Actually they wanted to take you down there,

04:34.077 --> 04:37.037
but it’s another high climb and I thought you will be all exhausted

04:37.237 --> 04:39.397
so I told her better not take that way.

04:39.637 --> 04:43.637
But normally those people who come to Nasik always go there.

04:43.837 --> 04:47.237
And there is one sad incident was that

04:47.437 --> 04:50.717
there’s a Trimbakeshwar where is there is one of the Jyotirlingas.

04:50.917 --> 04:53.197
There are twelve Jyotirlingas.

04:53.397 --> 04:56.877
Actually we should say they are fourteen because

04:57.077 --> 04:59.197
two of them are half, so .…

04:59.397 --> 05:03.277
There are twelve Jyotirlingas,

05:05.757 --> 05:09.717
and the complete are ten.

05:09.957 --> 05:12.957
Out of them, one of them is here.

05:13.157 --> 05:15.437
But the gentleman was quite funny and he said that

05:15.677 --> 05:19.357
"Those who are not Hindus, we cannot admit there".

05:19.677 --> 05:20.677
So it’s again

05:20.877 --> 05:24.237
all nonsense going on which will all stop one day, I’m sure,

05:24.437 --> 05:28.957
because they have no sense how to recognize the saints, you see.

05:29.197 --> 05:33.877
And once they start recognizing the saints, they will know that

05:34.077 --> 05:36.597
they are the first who should go inside,

05:36.797 --> 05:38.917
than those who are not realized.

05:39.117 --> 05:43.077
Moreover, for Shiva doesn’t matter whether they are even bhoots,

05:43.277 --> 05:47.197
doesn’t matter to Him. His temple need not be so guarded.

05:47.397 --> 05:50.357
Any other temple I can understand, but Shiva’s I can’t understand

05:50.597 --> 05:52.437
why there is so much guarding is needed.

05:52.677 --> 05:56.077
But I think it’s a money-making proposition.

05:56.317 --> 06:00.397
Whatever it is, it brings to My notice

06:00.637 --> 06:04.437
all these nonsensical things that are going on in this country.

06:04.757 --> 06:08.197
And then one starts realizing

06:08.437 --> 06:12.157
that how much people have to open out themselves and give up fear

06:12.357 --> 06:15.357
from people who are coming from other countries.

06:15.637 --> 06:19.757
They suffer all of them, not only,

06:19.957 --> 06:22.677
not only the people

06:22.877 --> 06:26.437
who are religious but also people who are political, social.

06:26.677 --> 06:31.157
They are all frightened of foreigners coming in now,

06:31.397 --> 06:34.917
in the country, and they always start doubting.

06:35.157 --> 06:38.757
And you can understand that’s why they doubt, but still

06:38.957 --> 06:43.357
they should also understand that in these advanced stages

06:43.597 --> 06:46.437
if there are saints, they should be able to recognize,

06:46.677 --> 06:48.997
and this is what’s lacking in them.

06:49.197 --> 06:51.797
And I was sad on that point, but doesn’t matter.

06:51.997 --> 06:55.757
I think next time I’ll put him right, this gentleman.

06:55.997 --> 06:59.797
So, on the whole, our whole stay was,

06:59.997 --> 07:03.197
I think was very interesting and nice, and this evening

07:03.397 --> 07:08.637
we are going to have a very beautiful musical program,

07:08.917 --> 07:13.917
variety entertainment and classical music by children,

07:14.117 --> 07:17.357
which you, I’m sure you’ll all enjoy very much.

07:17.717 --> 07:19.317
That we’ll have here.

07:19.557 --> 07:23.437
So on the whole we should be thankful to Mr. Sanghvi

07:23.717 --> 07:27.157
and to Mr. Mehtani for organizing

07:27.357 --> 07:30.797
this stay in Nasik so well

07:31.077 --> 07:33.717
and with such comfort to all of us,

07:33.917 --> 07:38.837
and such elevating experiences which has brought you

07:39.037 --> 07:44.437
to something higher, and the experience of your own depth.

07:44.957 --> 07:48.877
So may God bless you all.

08:06.557 --> 08:10.637
[Hindi/Marathi]

08:10.837 --> 08:13.917
[Hindi/Marathi]

08:14.157 --> 08:17.437
They have to first ask for forgiveness of all of you,

08:17.637 --> 08:19.877
and they are asking My forgiveness also.

08:20.237 --> 08:22.557
[Hindi/Marathi]

08:22.917 --> 08:26.437
[Hindi/Marathi]

08:42.117 --> 08:45.077
please forgive us,our whole family.”

08:46.717 --> 08:49.077
[Hindi/Marathi]

08:49.317 --> 08:53.397
[Hindi/Marathi]

10:30.197 --> 10:32.797
First you have to worship yourself. Otherwise …

10:32.997 --> 10:35.277
that’s why she has to worship herself,

10:35.437 --> 10:38.957
that she should make herself, cleanse herself,

10:39.157 --> 10:42.077
and she should worship herself, she should have respect for herself,

10:42.277 --> 10:44.037
and she is worshipping Me.

10:44.237 --> 10:45.877
If you are not a respectable person

10:46.077 --> 10:49.437
you are not supposed to worship Me.

11:04.757 --> 11:07.437
[Hindi/Marathi]

11:50.557 --> 11:54.277
[Hindi/Marathi]

11:55.077 --> 11:58.717

[Hindi/Marathi]

12:08.437 --> 12:10.797
[Hindi/Marathi]

12:10.997 --> 12:15.077

26:38.757 --> 26:44.037
There should be peace, and for the peace there’s a shanti mantra.

26:44.237 --> 26:48.597
Is important. Shanti, the peace has to be within and without.

26:48.837 --> 26:51.277
First it has to be established within.

26:51.437 --> 26:53.437
You must feel your peace within yourself.

26:53.717 --> 26:57.237
For that, this is a special mantra.

39:30.237 --> 39:34.957
Saraswati, Saraswati Mahalakshmi. [Hindi/Marathi]

39:35.237 --> 39:40.517
Now the Puja of Saraswati and Mahalakshmi.

45:30.877 --> 45:33.557
This is our offer to the Devi

45:33.757 --> 45:38.917
so that the disease of hunger should be eradicated.

46:41.437 --> 46:46.437
This is the worship of the deepa

46:47.357 --> 46:51.397
suggesting that “Oh Mother, we need not,

46:51.637 --> 46:57.117
we should not forget the Spirit, the light of Spirit within us,

46:57.957 --> 47:03.877
and we worship You with this light, so that our attention

47:04.117 --> 47:08.037
should be on that light which is the Spirit within us.

47:08.277 --> 47:11.157
And then they are praying, saying that

47:11.397 --> 47:15.997
“Remove the great darkness of moha.”

47:16.277 --> 47:18.357
“Moha” is attachment.

47:18.597 --> 47:20.957
Attachment.Ahamkar.

47:21.277 --> 47:23.637
And remove the, and “moha” means the attachment.

47:23.837 --> 47:26.437
- SY: Attachments.
- SM: Ahamkar. Aham attachments.

47:26.637 --> 47:28.117
Ahamkar, [Hindi/Marathi].

47:28.317 --> 47:31.757
Attachment, attachment.

47:42.357 --> 47:44.717
[Hindi/Marathi]

47:44.917 --> 47:47.637
[Hindi/Marathi]

48:31.997 --> 48:39.117
Now by doing karmas, our brains have muddled up.

48:39.837 --> 48:42.677
So Goddess, we offer You this dhupa

48:43.037 --> 48:48.317
so that You remove the enemy of karma in our head,

48:48.837 --> 48:51.357
remove all of the karmas from our head

48:51.557 --> 48:53.437
so that we are clarified, we give dhupa.

48:53.637 --> 48:56.597
Now, see, it’s so interesting that

48:56.997 --> 49:00.237
what they are suggesting is dhupam,

49:00.437 --> 49:05.437
is the, dhupam is given to Shri Krishna,

49:05.757 --> 49:09.877
who is the one who gives us the witness state.

49:10.157 --> 49:14.517
So how it is connected. Deepam is the Spirit,

49:14.917 --> 49:18.277
so you see how it is connected. The whole thing is so connected.

49:18.437 --> 49:19.637
[Hindi/Marathi]

49:19.837 --> 49:22.957
[Hindi/Marathi]

49:23.157 --> 49:26.117
[Hindi/Marathi]

50:27.997 --> 50:33.517
Now, it is so significant that a coconut is offered for moksha.

50:33.757 --> 50:36.797
Now, you know, coconut has a limbic area inside it.

50:36.997 --> 50:39.157
It has the three shells,

50:39.357 --> 50:42.597
just like your brain has, and inside is the limbic area.

50:42.797 --> 50:45.957
It represents the limbic area, and that’s why

50:46.157 --> 50:50.637
for moksha you have to go into the limbic area and that’s why

50:50.917 --> 50:56.077
a, is called as “shripala”, Holy Ghost, you see,

50:56.317 --> 50:58.597
the pala of the Holy Ghost, you see,

50:58.797 --> 51:01.797
the fruit that is liked, or representing Her.

51:01.997 --> 51:05.557
This is your limbic area, and that’s why it is given to the Mother.

51:05.757 --> 51:09.677
How significant, and how absolutely appropriate it is.

51:09.877 --> 51:14.157
God has also created this, just to suggest that thing.

51:16.637 --> 51:18.757

52:27.677 --> 52:30.557

52:31.917 --> 52:34.557
Now, this is a [Hindi/Marathi]

52:34.797 --> 52:38.637
This is, she has to offer Me a supari,

52:38.837 --> 52:42.277
which is the Ganesha Tattwa, and that is Agama Shastras,

52:42.437 --> 52:44.917
means the shastras which have come out of that.

52:45.117 --> 52:47.437
So “make me a virtuous personality”.

52:47.757 --> 52:50.677
All has come from Shri Ganesha,

52:50.877 --> 52:55.237
and Shri Ganesha makes you auspicious and also virtuous.

52:55.517 --> 52:58.717
"So the one from where all the shastras have come out,

52:58.957 --> 53:02.117
so this is the Shri Ganesha Tattwa which we offer You,

53:02.317 --> 53:05.157
so that You also make us virtuous

53:05.597 --> 53:09.917
and auspicious, by Your powers".

54:28.157 --> 54:30.597
Apple is for you, the Ganesha.

54:30.797 --> 54:33.437
See, it has an effect on the Mooladhara.

54:33.677 --> 54:36.677
If you are suffering from diarrhea this helps you.

54:36.917 --> 54:40.877
SY: [Hindi/Marathi]
SM: So this is for you people, the Ganesha,

54:41.077 --> 54:44.637
and for these country people this is the Ganesha.

54:44.837 --> 54:48.917
So God has given everything according to the need.

54:52.237 --> 54:55.757

[Hindi/Marathi]

55:05.437 --> 55:07.117
[Hindi/Marathi]

55:07.317 --> 55:08.997
Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati, Mahakali.

55:09.197 --> 55:11.757
Seven times.

55:11.957 --> 55:14.917
You have to say seven times the first mantra of

55:15.117 --> 55:18.717
Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati, seven times with her.

57:56.437 --> 58:00.077
Gavin, why have you dropped “Shri Mataji”?

58:02.157 --> 58:04.437
You should put “Shri Mataji” essentially

58:04.757 --> 58:08.877
because that’s the first name of the Sahasranama, all right?

58:09.077 --> 58:12.157
Should be there, “Shri Mataji”.

58:12.677 --> 58:16.757
When you are standardizing the thing - who has done this?

58:17.077 --> 58:19.917
– you must ask Me;

58:21.677 --> 58:25.397
Because that’s the biggest part, is that I am the Mother, isn’t it?

58:25.597 --> 58:27.197
[Hindi/Marathi]

58:27.397 --> 58:31.237
And that is actually the name given by the modern people,

58:31.717 --> 58:35.677
so it must be accepted. Is an additional thing.

58:39.157 --> 58:43.917
When you are standardizing the things, you must ask Me, all of you.

58:44.117 --> 58:48.557
I don’t know who has done it, but whosoever it is.

01:01:34.317 --> 01:01:37.077
Realized soul [Hindi/Marathi].

[Hindi/Marathi] Collective.

01:03:47.757 --> 01:03:51.717
Collectivity. [Hindi/Marathi]

01:03:51.917 --> 01:03:57.597
Collectivity. Sangha bhi means collectivity. Sa means collectivity.

01:04:30.797 --> 01:04:33.837

[Hindi/Marathi]

01:06:01.197 --> 01:06:05.597
And we can do hundred and eight names of Devi.

[Hindi/Marathi]

01:07:54.837 --> 01:07:58.677
[Hindi/Marathi]

01:08:05.917 --> 01:08:10.237
This one is all written in Marathi but so well done.

01:08:15.317 --> 01:08:17.957
I wish you could all remember by heart,

01:08:18.157 --> 01:08:21.877
so that it’s a very nice way of getting rid

01:08:22.077 --> 01:08:29.357
of our six types of enemies.

01:08:40.717 --> 01:08:43.197
You also don’t know what to ask God.

01:08:43.397 --> 01:08:47.317
You are always asking for something which is not important.

01:08:47.957 --> 01:08:50.717
Our priorities are all wrong.

01:08:51.117 --> 01:08:54.397
So this is a very good way of knowing exactly

01:08:54.597 --> 01:08:58.677
what a Sahaja yogi should ask.

01:08:59.517 --> 01:09:04.557
[Hindi/Marathi]

01:09:05.037 --> 01:09:11.437
[Hindi/Marathi]

01:09:28.557 --> 01:09:31.637
Mr. Sanghvi said that he would not accept any money

01:09:31.837 --> 01:09:37.277
from the people for Puja. I said, “But they must all join in”.

01:09:37.437 --> 01:09:42.357
So with great difficulty they agreed that we should collect

01:09:42.637 --> 01:09:48.197
eleven rupees from all of you for the Puja,

01:09:48.677 --> 01:09:51.637
and somebody should do it.

01:09:51.837 --> 01:09:52.957
Twenty one.

01:09:53.157 --> 01:09:57.197
You have done? You have done twenty-one? All right. Whatever it is.

01:10:08.517 --> 01:10:12.437
