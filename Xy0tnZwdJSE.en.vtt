Shri Ganesha Puja. Nasik (India), 18 January 1983.

00:00:07.157 --> 00:00:10.557
It is such a fortunate day today,

00:00:10.757 --> 00:00:15.557
that we should come on the birth of Shri Ganesha

00:00:15.757 --> 00:00:18.437
– today is Vinayak Chaturthi, today -

00:00:18.717 --> 00:00:23.757
that we should celebrate this Puja.

00:00:26.917 --> 00:00:29.397
Also, it is so fortunate to have people like

00:00:29.637 --> 00:00:35.517
Dr Sanghvi, his wife and his son, his daughter-in-law,

00:00:36.437 --> 00:00:41.037
who are so much dedicated to Sahaja Yoga.

00:00:43.597 --> 00:00:47.957
In 1972 I had visited Pune, Nasik,

00:00:48.157 --> 00:00:51.797
and we had a big session here.

00:00:52.077 --> 00:00:56.717
People from all over came; we got a lot of Sahaja yogis here.

00:00:57.037 --> 00:00:59.397
Raulbai is one of them.

00:00:59.637 --> 00:01:05.317
But the people of Nasik did not come forward much to do Sahaja Yoga,

00:01:05.637 --> 00:01:09.797
and sort of, we didn’t find any

00:01:11.117 --> 00:01:16.157
footing place here, so we gave up coming to Nasik.

00:01:16.397 --> 00:01:21.277
And today after so many days, now I’m back here.

00:01:22.157 --> 00:01:27.997
And it’s so surprising how we have been able to manage.

00:01:29.997 --> 00:01:31.637
So many people yesterday, about,

00:01:31.837 --> 00:01:35.677
they are saying about ten thousand people were present.

00:01:35.877 --> 00:01:38.397
And at least, I would say that ninety percent people

00:01:38.637 --> 00:01:42.637
got Realization, at least.

00:01:44.077 --> 00:01:49.917
Now, I have to say that the quality of people is very important,

00:01:50.517 --> 00:01:55.957
and in Maharashtra you must understand that there’s a quality.

00:01:56.237 --> 00:02:00.797
These people have a special quality of purity, I think,

00:02:01.037 --> 00:02:03.517
that invariably

00:02:03.757 --> 00:02:06.997
I’ve seen the amount of working it takes place in Maharashtra,

00:02:07.197 --> 00:02:10.357
doesn’t take place in other place.

00:02:11.317 --> 00:02:14.317
Perhaps the people are very much aware

00:02:14.557 --> 00:02:18.317
of the three and a half peethas they have here.

00:02:18.597 --> 00:02:24.037
Now for, they are Jains and have been following Jainism but

00:02:24.237 --> 00:02:27.637
still they always worshipped the Goddess, the Devi.

00:02:27.877 --> 00:02:33.077
So, we can understand that what is an impact

00:02:33.277 --> 00:02:37.117
of those three and a half peethas is.

00:02:37.437 --> 00:02:39.317
And you have visited

00:02:39.597 --> 00:02:44.757
the great shrine of Chaturshringi.

00:02:46.397 --> 00:02:47.237
Saptashringi.

00:02:47.437 --> 00:02:50.957
I’m sorry, Saptashringi. [Hindi/Marathi]

00:02:51.197 --> 00:02:52.917
Today being Ganesha’s day,

00:02:53.117 --> 00:02:56.317
only it is going to come "chatura" in My mouth.

00:02:56.757 --> 00:02:58.597
So this Saptashringi is the one

00:02:58.797 --> 00:03:02.357
who has got seven chakras, means the limbic area,

00:03:02.597 --> 00:03:05.517
and She is the Sahasrara, representing the Sahasrara.

00:03:05.757 --> 00:03:09.357
That’s why she’s the Ardha-Matra.

00:03:09.917 --> 00:03:13.677
And Her face and body and all that you can see,

00:03:13.917 --> 00:03:16.437
is so beautifully made,

00:03:16.677 --> 00:03:21.557
that it emits vibrations for miles together.

00:03:21.797 --> 00:03:25.077
Those who are sensitive can feel it.

00:03:26.557 --> 00:03:31.597
And you have been so lucky to go there and see that

00:03:31.877 --> 00:03:35.677
miraculous place, that this have come out of Mother Earth.

00:03:36.077 --> 00:03:37.917
And since ancient times it has been there.

00:03:38.117 --> 00:03:41.637
Nobody knows when it appeared.

00:03:44.117 --> 00:03:47.077
So we are in a very holy place,

00:03:47.237 --> 00:03:53.117
because as you know Sita lived here for so many years

00:03:53.357 --> 00:03:58.397
and Shri Rama was also with Her, and also Shri Lakshmana.

00:03:58.677 --> 00:04:04.317
So it is obvious that this is a big kind of,

00:04:04.557 --> 00:04:06.957
we can say a,

00:04:07.197 --> 00:04:11.877
quite a big meeting place of various holy things,

00:04:12.077 --> 00:04:17.957
that happened during the different periods of Maharashtra.

00:04:19.637 --> 00:04:25.437
And the River Godavari also flows and the, also the

00:04:27.557 --> 00:04:31.837
[Hindi/Marathi] source, source of this river is also very near.

00:04:32.037 --> 00:04:33.877
Actually they wanted to take you down there,

00:04:34.077 --> 00:04:37.037
but it’s another high climb and I thought you will be all exhausted

00:04:37.237 --> 00:04:39.397
so I told her better not take that way.

00:04:39.637 --> 00:04:43.637
But normally those people who come to Nasik always go there.

00:04:43.837 --> 00:04:47.237
And there is one sad incident was that

00:04:47.437 --> 00:04:50.717
there’s a Trimbakeshwar where is there is one of the Jyotirlingas.

00:04:50.917 --> 00:04:53.197
There are twelve Jyotirlingas.

00:04:53.397 --> 00:04:56.877
Actually we should say they are fourteen because

00:04:57.077 --> 00:04:59.197
two of them are half, so .…

00:04:59.397 --> 00:05:03.277
There are twelve Jyotirlingas,

00:05:05.757 --> 00:05:09.717
and the complete are ten.

00:05:09.957 --> 00:05:12.957
Out of them, one of them is here.

00:05:13.157 --> 00:05:15.437
But the gentleman was quite funny and he said that

00:05:15.677 --> 00:05:19.357
"Those who are not Hindus, we cannot admit there".

00:05:19.677 --> 00:05:20.677
So it’s again

00:05:20.877 --> 00:05:24.237
all nonsense going on which will all stop one day, I’m sure,

00:05:24.437 --> 00:05:28.957
because they have no sense how to recognize the saints, you see.

00:05:29.197 --> 00:05:33.877
And once they start recognizing the saints, they will know that

00:05:34.077 --> 00:05:36.597
they are the first who should go inside,

00:05:36.797 --> 00:05:38.917
than those who are not realized.

00:05:39.117 --> 00:05:43.077
Moreover, for Shiva doesn’t matter whether they are even bhoots,

00:05:43.277 --> 00:05:47.197
doesn’t matter to Him. His temple need not be so guarded.

00:05:47.397 --> 00:05:50.357
Any other temple I can understand, but Shiva’s I can’t understand

00:05:50.597 --> 00:05:52.437
why there is so much guarding is needed.

00:05:52.677 --> 00:05:56.077
But I think it’s a money-making proposition.

00:05:56.317 --> 00:06:00.397
Whatever it is, it brings to My notice

00:06:00.637 --> 00:06:04.437
all these nonsensical things that are going on in this country.

00:06:04.757 --> 00:06:08.197
And then one starts realizing

00:06:08.437 --> 00:06:12.157
that how much people have to open out themselves and give up fear

00:06:12.357 --> 00:06:15.357
from people who are coming from other countries.

00:06:15.637 --> 00:06:19.757
They suffer all of them, not only,

00:06:19.957 --> 00:06:22.677
not only the people

00:06:22.877 --> 00:06:26.437
who are religious but also people who are political, social.

00:06:26.677 --> 00:06:31.157
They are all frightened of foreigners coming in now,

00:06:31.397 --> 00:06:34.917
in the country, and they always start doubting.

00:06:35.157 --> 00:06:38.757
And you can understand that’s why they doubt, but still

00:06:38.957 --> 00:06:43.357
they should also understand that in these advanced stages

00:06:43.597 --> 00:06:46.437
if there are saints, they should be able to recognize,

00:06:46.677 --> 00:06:48.997
and this is what’s lacking in them.

00:06:49.197 --> 00:06:51.797
And I was sad on that point, but doesn’t matter.

00:06:51.997 --> 00:06:55.757
I think next time I’ll put him right, this gentleman.

00:06:55.997 --> 00:06:59.797
So, on the whole, our whole stay was,

00:06:59.997 --> 00:07:03.197
I think was very interesting and nice, and this evening

00:07:03.397 --> 00:07:08.637
we are going to have a very beautiful musical program,

00:07:08.917 --> 00:07:13.917
variety entertainment and classical music by children,

00:07:14.117 --> 00:07:17.357
which you, I’m sure you’ll all enjoy very much.

00:07:17.717 --> 00:07:19.317
That we’ll have here.

00:07:19.557 --> 00:07:23.437
So on the whole we should be thankful to Mr. Sanghvi

00:07:23.717 --> 00:07:27.157
and to Mr. Mehtani for organizing

00:07:27.357 --> 00:07:30.797
this stay in Nasik so well

00:07:31.077 --> 00:07:33.717
and with such comfort to all of us,

00:07:33.917 --> 00:07:38.837
and such elevating experiences which has brought you

00:07:39.037 --> 00:07:44.437
to something higher, and the experience of your own depth.

00:07:44.957 --> 00:07:48.877
So may God bless you all.

00:08:06.557 --> 00:08:10.637
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:08:10.837 --> 00:08:13.917
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:08:14.157 --> 00:08:17.437
They have to first ask for forgiveness of all of you,

00:08:17.637 --> 00:08:19.877
and they are asking My forgiveness also.

00:08:20.237 --> 00:08:22.557
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:08:22.917 --> 00:08:26.437

[Hindi/Marathi]

00:08:39.997 --> 00:08:41.917
They say, "If we have done any mistakes,

00:08:42.117 --> 00:08:45.077
please forgive us,our whole family.”

00:08:46.717 --> 00:08:49.077
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:08:49.317 --> 00:08:53.397
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:10:30.197 --> 00:10:32.797
First you have to worship yourself. Otherwise …

00:10:32.997 --> 00:10:35.277
that’s why she has to worship herself,

00:10:35.437 --> 00:10:38.957
that she should make herself, cleanse herself,

00:10:39.157 --> 00:10:42.077
and she should worship herself, she should have respect for herself,

00:10:42.277 --> 00:10:44.037
and she is worshipping Me.

00:10:44.237 --> 00:10:45.877
If you are not a respectable person

00:10:46.077 --> 00:10:49.437
you are not supposed to worship Me.

00:11:04.757 --> 00:11:07.437
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:11:50.557 --> 00:11:54.277

[Hindi/Marathi]

00:26:38.757 --> 00:26:44.037
There should be peace, and for the peace there’s a shanti mantra.

00:26:44.237 --> 00:26:48.597
Is important. Shanti, the peace has to be within and without.

00:26:48.837 --> 00:26:51.277
First it has to be established within.

00:26:51.437 --> 00:26:53.437
You must feel your peace within yourself.

00:26:53.717 --> 00:26:57.237
For that, this is a special mantra.

00:45:30.877 --> 00:45:33.557
This is our offer to the Devi

so that the disease of hunger should be eradicated.

00:46:41.437 --> 00:46:46.437
This is the worship of the deepa

00:46:47.357 --> 00:46:51.397
suggesting that “Oh Mother, we need not,

00:46:51.637 --> 00:46:57.117
we should not forget the Spirit, the light of Spirit within us,

00:46:57.957 --> 00:47:03.877
and we worship You with this light, so that our attention

00:47:04.117 --> 00:47:08.037
should be on that light which is the Spirit within us.

00:47:08.277 --> 00:47:11.157
And then they are praying, saying that

00:47:11.397 --> 00:47:15.997
“Remove the great darkness of moha.”

00:47:16.277 --> 00:47:18.357
“Moha” is attachment.

00:47:18.597 --> 00:47:20.957
Attachment.Ahamkar.

00:47:21.277 --> 00:47:23.637
And remove the, and “moha” means the attachment.

00:47:23.837 --> 00:47:26.437
- SY: Attachments.
- SM: Ahamkar. Aham attachments.

00:47:26.637 --> 00:47:28.117

00:47:28.317 --> 00:47:31.757

[Hindi/Marathi]

00:47:44.917 --> 00:47:47.637
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:48:31.997 --> 00:48:39.117
Now by doing karmas, our brains have muddled up.

00:48:39.837 --> 00:48:42.677
So Goddess, we offer You this dhupa

00:48:43.037 --> 00:48:48.317
so that You remove the enemy of karma in our head,

00:48:48.837 --> 00:48:51.357
remove all of the karmas from our head

00:48:51.557 --> 00:48:53.437
so that we are clarified, we give dhupa.

00:48:53.637 --> 00:48:56.597
Now, see, it’s so interesting that

00:48:56.997 --> 00:49:00.237
what they are suggesting is dhupam,

00:49:00.437 --> 00:49:05.437
is the, dhupam is given to Shri Krishna,

00:49:05.757 --> 00:49:09.877
who is the one who gives us the witness state.

00:49:10.157 --> 00:49:14.517
So how it is connected. Deepam is the Spirit,

00:49:14.917 --> 00:49:18.277
so you see how it is connected. The whole thing is so connected.

00:49:18.437 --> 00:49:19.637

[Hindi/Marathi]

00:50:27.997 --> 00:50:33.517
Now, it is so significant that a coconut is offered for moksha.

00:50:33.757 --> 00:50:36.797
Now, you know, coconut has a limbic area inside it.

00:50:36.997 --> 00:50:39.157
It has the three shells,

00:50:39.357 --> 00:50:42.597
just like your brain has, and inside is the limbic area.

00:50:42.797 --> 00:50:45.957
It represents the limbic area, and that’s why

00:50:46.157 --> 00:50:50.637
for moksha you have to go into the limbic area and that’s why

00:50:50.917 --> 00:50:56.077
a, is called as “shripala”, Holy Ghost, you see,

00:50:56.317 --> 00:50:58.597
the pala of the Holy Ghost, you see,

00:50:58.797 --> 00:51:01.797
the fruit that is liked, or representing Her.

00:51:01.997 --> 00:51:05.557
This is your limbic area, and that’s why it is given to the Mother.

00:51:05.757 --> 00:51:09.677
How significant, and how absolutely appropriate it is.

00:51:09.877 --> 00:51:14.157
God has also created this, just to suggest that thing.

00:52:45.117 --> 00:52:47.437

so this is the Shri Ganesha Tattwa which we offer You,

00:53:02.317 --> 00:53:05.157

Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati, seven times with her.

00:57:56.437 --> 00:58:00.077
Gavin, why have you dropped “Shri Mataji”?

00:58:02.157 --> 00:58:04.437
You should put “Shri Mataji” essentially

00:58:04.757 --> 00:58:08.877
because that’s the first name of the Sahasranama, all right?

00:58:09.077 --> 00:58:12.157
Should be there, “Shri Mataji”.

00:58:12.677 --> 00:58:16.757
When you are standardizing the thing - who has done this?

00:58:17.077 --> 00:58:19.917
– you must ask Me;

00:58:21.677 --> 00:58:25.397

00:58:25.597 --> 00:58:27.197
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:58:27.397 --> 00:58:31.237

00:58:31.717 --> 00:58:35.677
so it must be accepted. Is an additional thing.

00:58:39.157 --> 00:58:43.917
When you are standardizing the things, you must ask Me, all of you.

00:58:44.117 --> 00:58:48.557
I don’t know who has done it, but whosoever it is.

[Hindi/Marathi]

01:08:05.917 --> 01:08:10.237
This one is all written in Marathi but so well done.

01:08:15.317 --> 01:08:17.957
I wish you could all remember by heart,

01:08:18.157 --> 01:08:21.877
so that it’s a very nice way of getting rid

01:08:22.077 --> 01:08:29.357
of our six types of enemies.

01:08:40.717 --> 01:08:43.197
You also don’t know what to ask God.

01:08:43.397 --> 01:08:47.317
You are always asking for something which is not important.

01:08:47.957 --> 01:08:50.717
Our priorities are all wrong.

01:08:51.117 --> 01:08:54.397
So this is a very good way of knowing exactly

01:08:54.597 --> 01:08:58.677
what a Sahaja yogi should ask.

01:08:59.517 --> 01:09:04.557
[Hindi/Marathi]

01:09:05.037 --> 01:09:11.437
[Hindi/Marathi]

01:09:28.557 --> 01:09:31.637
Mr. Sanghvi said that he would not accept any money

01:09:31.837 --> 01:09:37.277
from the people for Puja. I said, “But they must all join in”.

01:09:37.437 --> 01:09:42.357
So with great difficulty they agreed that we should collect

01:09:42.637 --> 01:09:48.197
eleven rupees from all of you for the Puja,

01:09:48.677 --> 01:09:51.637
and somebody should do it.

01:09:51.837 --> 01:09:52.957
Twenty one.

01:09:53.157 --> 01:09:57.197
You have done? You have done twenty-one? All right. Whatever it is.

01:10:08.517 --> 01:10:12.437

Now all the people from Nasik are going to do this,

01:14:03.837 --> 01:14:06.917
so little bit you have to move out.

01:14:07.117 --> 01:14:10.437

And Nala if you can move out, these people will sit that side.

01:16:25.637 --> 01:16:28.317
[Hindi/Marathi] You must spread something for them.

01:16:28.597 --> 01:16:32.917

01:16:33.117 --> 01:16:35.797

Alexander, you also move out a little,

01:17:20.597 --> 01:17:23.517
because others have to sit there. All right?

01:17:25.437 --> 01:17:31.397
