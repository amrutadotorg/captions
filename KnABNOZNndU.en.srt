1
00:00:07,413 --> 00:00:09,400
I am just pointing it out

2
00:00:09,462 --> 00:00:12,541
how, in the modern times, you have to be very careful

3
00:00:12,742 --> 00:00:19,253
that you should not try to attract the attention of others.

4
00:00:19,454 --> 00:00:24,636
Instead of that, what you have to do is to pay attention to others

5
00:00:24,837 --> 00:00:29,157
in a very subtle way, not with any expectation

6
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:34,911
that if you are paying attention to somebody, that person should pay attention to you.

7
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:36,824
It’s a very big struggle,

8
00:00:36,905 --> 00:00:45,143
I’ve seen, in Sahaja Yoga also, that people try to, say, become very popular

9
00:00:45,224 --> 00:00:53,286
or become very outstanding, or something of a very great qualities,

10
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:58,014
to show off that they are something better than others.

11
00:00:58,215 --> 00:01:03,691
A person who is really in connection with the Divine, is least bothered

12
00:01:03,892 --> 00:01:08,877
about how people pay attention to that person,

13
00:01:09,078 --> 00:01:15,653
but automatically the attention of such a person is on others,

14
00:01:15,854 --> 00:01:19,068
which is very, very subtle, very subtle.

15
00:01:19,269 --> 00:01:23,301
You cannot make out that the attention of such a person

16
00:01:23,502 --> 00:01:29,500
is on you, but it works and it works beautifully.

17
00:01:29,701 --> 00:01:35,102
We have to understand that we have now come to the realm of the Divinity.

18
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:40,199
We are in the Kingdom of God and we are divine people.

19
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,718
We are very powerful people, but if we fritter away

20
00:01:44,919 --> 00:01:48,678
our attention, we become very, very weak people.

21
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:54,675
It's easy to feel that, “we are Sahaja Yogis”, “we have done

22
00:01:54,863 --> 00:02:00,952
so much of realisation of others” or “we have helped so many people.”

23
00:02:01,153 --> 00:02:05,012
All this consciousness if it comes within you, then know

24
00:02:05,213 --> 00:02:09,342
that you are still not fully developed Sahaja Yogis.

25
00:02:09,543 --> 00:02:15,439
There should be no consciousness of what you are doing or what you are committing.

26
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:23,711
There is no need to boast about it. There is no need to advertise it.

27
00:02:23,912 --> 00:02:28,229
Whatever you are, is already, can be seen by everyone.

28
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:32,177
But even that desire is not needed

29
00:02:32,378 --> 00:02:38,392
because you are doing just for the satisfaction of your Spirit.

30
00:02:39,483 --> 00:02:43,339
So then, when we come to our heart:

31
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:47,075
in the heart resides the Spirit, as you know very well.

32
00:02:47,276 --> 00:02:54,987
Now, when it is the heart, which has to work over your brain and which can work,

33
00:02:55,188 --> 00:02:59,847
what becomes of you is nothing, but you become a source

34
00:03:00,048 --> 00:03:03,405
of love and compassion. A source, I am saying.

35
00:03:03,606 --> 00:03:09,275
You do not assert on others. You do not say that, “I’ve done so much for you

36
00:03:09,476 --> 00:03:18,639
and what are you doing to me? What is this that I should have so much expressed,

37
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,627
in so many ways, and here you are,

38
00:03:21,828 --> 00:03:26,204
you are forgetting me and not doing anything for me?”

39
00:03:26,405 --> 00:03:31,910
So the expectation of reward if it is there,

40
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:36,362
then you must know is your mind which is giving you these ideas

41
00:03:36,563 --> 00:03:43,152
and is working it out that way that you just now put attention

42
00:03:43,353 --> 00:03:47,085
to the amount of love the other person has given you

43
00:03:47,286 --> 00:03:54,686
for whatever you have given to another person. It's very subtle.

44
00:03:57,135 --> 00:04:03,850
So in Sahaja Yoga, you should see now yourself as just a source of love,

45
00:04:04,051 --> 00:04:07,991
which is just flowing.

46
00:04:08,192 --> 00:04:13,546
In that, you do not say that you have to have this or that,

47
00:04:13,747 --> 00:04:21,137
or you have to achieve this goal, or you have to become that. It's finished now.

48
00:04:21,338 --> 00:04:28,213
Once you have become the source, then how can you become something?

49
00:04:28,414 --> 00:04:34,432
The thing is, those who are receiving from the source want to have

50
00:04:34,633 --> 00:04:46,393
some sort of a reward or some sort of a recognition.

51
00:04:46,594 --> 00:04:52,804
In this subtle way if you move, your mind is very clever.

52
00:04:53,005 --> 00:04:57,931
In Sahaja Yoga, we have very clever, intelligent people.

53
00:04:58,132 --> 00:05:05,757
But this mind... You have to be very careful because this mind can cheat you.

54
00:05:07,673 --> 00:05:12,370
So ask your mind, "Why are you in Sahaja Yoga?

55
00:05:12,571 --> 00:05:17,136
What is the purpose of your Sahaja Yoga?"

56
00:05:18,461 --> 00:05:26,740
Gradually this mind will shut up. And then, you have to ask yourself that,

57
00:05:26,941 --> 00:05:35,265
"What is my own desire now? What do I want?

58
00:05:35,466 --> 00:05:42,069
What do I want to achieve? Why I am in Sahaja Yoga?"

59
00:05:42,815 --> 00:05:46,994
If you ask this question, you will see you’ll just dissolve,

60
00:05:47,195 --> 00:05:52,476
you'll become thoughtless because there is no desire left now.

61
00:05:52,677 --> 00:05:55,823
There is no ambition left, no competition.
