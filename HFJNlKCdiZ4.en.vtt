00:00:01.792 --> 00:00:03.500
who was just a fisherman.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.166
He wrote Ramayana, he was a great Brahmin.

00:00:06.417 --> 00:00:09.333
Then you have got Vyasa who wrote Gita.

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:16.583
He was an illegitimate son of a fisherwoman and he wrote Gita.

00:00:17.041 --> 00:00:23.667
So this idea was flouted by Shri Krishna's incarnation.

00:00:24.208 --> 00:00:28.709
He wanted to flout this idea that Brahmins are the ones

00:00:28.917 --> 00:00:31.917
who can only worship God.

00:00:32.291 --> 00:00:38.083
So to put another extreme

00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:42.291
to what Rama has created,

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:45.208
to bring people into the centre,

00:00:45.417 --> 00:00:49.250
because through Rama they went to another rigid form

00:00:49.583 --> 00:00:51.667
and rigidity of ritualism

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:57.750
and too much of fundamentalism.

00:00:58.041 --> 00:00:59.750
So to put an end to that

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:02.792
he wanted to bring the society to another extreme.

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:08.834
Of course Shri Rama himself incarnated as Shri Krishna.

00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:13.583
So he started a new theme of,

00:01:13.792 --> 00:01:20.000
which was absolutely eventual, it was just absolutely evolutionary

00:01:20.208 --> 00:01:22.625
that such a new theme should come up.

00:01:22.875 --> 00:01:27.834
And this new theme was that the whole thing is nothing but a Leela.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.000
It's just a play, it's a Leela.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.792
So not to be taken that seriously, not to be so rigid,

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:41.458
not to be fundamental, not to be so particular about something.

00:01:41.792 --> 00:01:44.166
So the whole thing is a Leela.

00:01:44.417 --> 00:01:48.792
And on this theme he worked out everything

00:01:49.083 --> 00:01:52.125
to establish that it is a play.

00:01:52.834 --> 00:01:55.792
And that is what you see in America,

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:59.125
very common that for people it has become a joke,

00:01:59.375 --> 00:02:01.917
life has become a joke.

00:02:02.166 --> 00:02:04.875
And they think that life is not to be taken seriously,

00:02:05.083 --> 00:02:09.125
there is more fun in doing all kinds of things

00:02:09.375 --> 00:02:15.250
than in getting into any kind of inhibitions, as they call it,

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.999
or maybe some sort of forms or patterns.

00:02:21.333 --> 00:02:24.208
But it is a myth with Americans now

00:02:24.417 --> 00:02:27.250
because for that you have to have Shri Krishna,

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.291
you have to have realisation.

00:02:29.542 --> 00:02:32.333
Like if you are standing in the water,

00:02:32.625 --> 00:02:39.542
the waves of the water are there absolutely real for you and you,

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.458
if you think it's a illusion you'll be completely finished.

00:02:46.125 --> 00:02:49.583
The illusion will prove that it's not an illusion

00:02:49.792 --> 00:02:51.875
by asserting itself.

00:02:52.083 --> 00:02:53.999
But if you're in the boat

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.125
then the water that is around is an illusion.

00:02:58.375 --> 00:03:00.834
So it's the state at which you are.

00:03:01.083 --> 00:03:05.500
If you are in the state of self-realised mind,

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.083
then everything is an illusion, but otherwise it is not.

00:03:10.333 --> 00:03:14.166
It is a reality. So what they forgot this point,

00:03:14.375 --> 00:03:17.417
that you are not in that state to call it an illusion.

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.542
So to call everything an illusion is just to delude yourself,

00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:23.291
thinking that it's an illusion

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.500
and doesn't matter, what's wrong, so what.

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:31.625
It's quite symbolic that in Shri Krishna's place

00:03:31.834 --> 00:03:33.166
this thing should be so

00:03:33.375 --> 00:03:36.750
commonly accepted that everything is an illusion.

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.166
So who is wrong, who is bad, nothing is wrong.

00:03:40.375 --> 00:03:44.166
There is nothing like evil, nothing like good.

00:03:44.458 --> 00:03:46.583
And some people go to that limit to say

00:03:46.792 --> 00:03:49.542
that there's nothing like a bhoot, nothing like a rakshasa,

00:03:49.792 --> 00:03:52.041
nothing like a evil force.

00:03:52.333 --> 00:03:55.999
Now for Shri Krishna how did he look at things was this way

00:03:56.208 --> 00:04:02.041
that for him even to kill a rakshasa was a play.

00:04:02.792 --> 00:04:07.333
To destroy a rakshasa was also a play.

00:04:08.166 --> 00:04:12.083
In that play he was to be destroyed.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:18.166
So he discriminated in a way that what play is to be destroyed,

00:04:18.375 --> 00:04:20.792
what not to be destroyed.

00:04:20.999 --> 00:04:24.417
The play of the evil he destroyed by his own play.

00:04:24.667 --> 00:04:27.250
So to say there was nothing evil is also wrong.

00:04:27.458 --> 00:04:30.625
Like even if you think everything is a play,

00:04:30.834 --> 00:04:35.041
what happens that your attitude towards it is like a spectator.

00:04:35.333 --> 00:04:38.083
You see the whole thing as a spectator,

00:04:38.333 --> 00:04:39.875
like in a drama you sit down

00:04:40.083 --> 00:04:42.166
and you watch everything as a spectator,

00:04:42.417 --> 00:04:48.333
but you know what is depicting tragedy and what is depicting comedy.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.834
You are not inert to that then you are good for nothing.

00:04:53.041 --> 00:04:56.208
That doesn't mean that you become inert to that.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.875
You have a sense of discretion to know

00:04:59.041 --> 00:05:01.625
what is a comedy and what is a tragedy.

00:05:01.875 --> 00:05:06.417
But if you are an actor, then to you it is not,

00:05:06.959 --> 00:05:11.417
it is not a comedy or a tragedy, it is a work for you.

00:05:11.667 --> 00:05:14.834
If you're acting then you're acting and you're an actor,

00:05:15.041 --> 00:05:18.125
you're involved in it. So it is not,

00:05:18.458 --> 00:05:20.166
for you do not know the discretion

00:05:20.375 --> 00:05:21.999
between the tragedy and the comedy.

00:05:22.166 --> 00:05:25.250
For you, you're just an actor as long as you're paid well,

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.999
if you do your job well, then it's a comedy,

00:05:29.166 --> 00:05:32.041
otherwise it's a tragedy.

00:05:32.583 --> 00:05:36.333
So there are two types of awareness, now of one of a spectator,

00:05:36.583 --> 00:05:40.166
another of the one who is in it.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.125
So one has to understand in that light,

00:05:43.417 --> 00:05:46.291
that when Krishna said the whole thing is a play,

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.542
he was meaning for him, not for others.

00:05:52.083 --> 00:05:53.542
For him it is a play.

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.542
And that's why when they talk to you about the play and the illusion

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.917
you must tell them then why did he kill Kamsa.

00:06:01.083 --> 00:06:03.917
Why did he kill Jarasandha?

00:06:04.083 --> 00:06:09.417
Why did he kill all the people who were following Kamsa?

00:06:09.792 --> 00:06:13.041
So to him it was a play, everything was a play

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:17.999
and he did it in his own attitude of a play.

00:06:18.458 --> 00:06:23.291
So the first thing if you are

00:06:23.625 --> 00:06:25.792
awakened by Shri Krishna's powers,

00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:30.291
then the first thing that should happen to you is wisdom.

00:06:30.834 --> 00:06:35.375
Now the wisdom is something you cannot describe.

00:06:35.583 --> 00:06:37.959
You cannot say what is wisdom.

00:06:38.166 --> 00:06:42.041
It's very difficult to describe it or to delimit it.

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:45.625
Wisdom is a temperament,

00:06:45.875 --> 00:06:49.083
is a quality of a personality

00:06:49.458 --> 00:06:54.458
which comes to you by balancing yourself, by trial and error method.

00:06:54.709 --> 00:06:58.709
All traditional countries innately have much more wisdom than people

00:06:58.959 --> 00:07:00.709
who are not traditional.

00:07:00.959 --> 00:07:03.834
But Krishna broke all the traditions.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.125
That's why you people are here without much tradition.

00:07:07.375 --> 00:07:11.375
He broke all the traditions, but he was Shri Krishna,

00:07:11.583 --> 00:07:14.083
so he did not need any tradition at all.

00:07:14.291 --> 00:07:17.458
But for you, you have to understand from the people

00:07:17.667 --> 00:07:19.834
who have tradition what is wisdom.

00:07:20.041 --> 00:07:24.250
So we do trial and error. We make mistakes, from that we learn.

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:29.792
But when the ego is so strong in a country like America,

00:07:29.999 --> 00:07:34.667
when we do wrong, we do not want to accept it was wrong,Â¨

00:07:34.917 --> 00:07:41.542
it was against our ascent, it was against our higher goals.

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:43.583
We get satisfied with the lower goals,

00:07:43.834 --> 00:07:48.208
like I've seen people who do some funny things in Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:48.583 --> 00:07:52.291
They don't realise that this is absolutely against them,

00:07:52.667 --> 00:07:55.709
whatever they are doing is against them, they should not do this,

00:07:55.917 --> 00:07:58.458
it was wrong to do it. On the contrary,

00:07:58.667 --> 00:08:00.083
they catch on the left Vishuddhi

00:08:00.291 --> 00:08:03.542
that is another catch they have on the Vishuddhi chakra.

00:08:03.917 --> 00:08:07.875
So because you're indiscreet, you do wrong things.

00:08:08.125 --> 00:08:12.667
To develop discretion, outcome of all this is discretion.

00:08:12.875 --> 00:08:15.834
You make mistakes. When you make mistakes,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:16.959
instead of

00:08:17.125 --> 00:08:19.291
developing the discretionabout it that this was a mistake,

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:22.083
next time we should not do it, facing up to it,

00:08:22.291 --> 00:08:25.999
what we do is to feel guilty about it, so you escape it,

00:08:26.166 --> 00:08:29.208
spoiling the other chakra also.

00:08:29.458 --> 00:08:37.125
That is how people get a problem on the left Vishuddhi,

00:08:37.667 --> 00:08:39.999
and left Vishuddhi is that you feel guilty.

00:08:40.208 --> 00:08:44.166
It's very good to feel guilty than to do anything about it.

00:08:44.709 --> 00:08:46.959
That's the best way to escape it.

00:08:47.208 --> 00:08:51.625
Actually we have seen that mostly left Vishuddhi comes from ego.

00:08:51.959 --> 00:08:54.542
When ego is too much, you can't bear your ego,

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:57.500
so you put it in the guilty side of it,

00:08:57.709 --> 00:09:01.417
and you say, "I'm very guilty, I should not have done it."

00:09:01.709 --> 00:09:02.750
Now the another side

00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:05.792
which is also very dangerous is the right Vishuddhi.

00:09:05.999 --> 00:09:08.041
Right Vishuddhi is the one by which

00:09:08.291 --> 00:09:12.625
we try to justify all our indiscreet behaviour.

00:09:13.375 --> 00:09:16.166
So, "What's wrong?"

00:09:17.875 --> 00:09:21.583
"What is wrong in this?" "So what!"

00:09:22.125 --> 00:09:24.542
All these things are right Vishuddhi problems.

00:09:24.792 --> 00:09:29.166
So it's very common you tell somebody that it is wrong to do,

00:09:29.375 --> 00:09:31.542
for example they paint their hair.

00:09:31.792 --> 00:09:35.166
You tell them, "Don't do this, it will spoil your eyes,"

00:09:35.375 --> 00:09:40.333
they will say, "So what, we have a right to spoil ourselves,

00:09:40.667 --> 00:09:43.041
we have a right to destroy ourselves," as if they are Shri Krishna,

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:46.250
that they can destroy themselves, can they?

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:52.999
They cannot even create a little ant,

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:56.917
leave alone ant, they can't even create a stone.

00:09:57.333 --> 00:09:59.667
And how do they have right to destroy themselves?

00:09:59.917 --> 00:10:01.333
So this is the right side thing

00:10:01.583 --> 00:10:07.875
where we think that we have the right to destroy.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:13.166
As I told you about eyes yesterday, it's very important

00:10:13.458 --> 00:10:17.792
that eyes are the ones

00:10:17.999 --> 00:10:20.834
which gives you the play of Shri Krishna,

00:10:21.291 --> 00:10:22.625
the power of Shri Krishna.

00:10:22.917 --> 00:10:28.125
Even a glance, a little glance of a person

00:10:28.333 --> 00:10:31.083
who has Krishna consciousness, as they call it,

00:10:31.291 --> 00:10:32.999
if he has Krishna consciousness,

00:10:33.166 --> 00:10:35.959
then should be able to awaken the Kundalini,

00:10:36.125 --> 00:10:39.542
should be able to redeem, should be able to comfort,

00:10:39.792 --> 00:10:41.208
should be able to cure anyone.

00:10:41.458 --> 00:10:44.083
Even a glance, a side glance can do it,

00:10:44.333 --> 00:10:46.125
if it has Krishna consciousness,

00:10:46.375 --> 00:10:50.208
but not self-certified ones who say, "We are Krishna consciousness,"

00:10:50.458 --> 00:10:54.750
all the time taking the name of Shri Krishna or any mantra.

00:10:54.999 --> 00:10:59.250
So on the left hand side the escape is feeling guilty.

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:00.542
When you feel guilty,

00:11:00.792 --> 00:11:03.792
they try to find out some method of expression.

00:11:03.999 --> 00:11:05.792
So they say they go to some guru

00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:08.583
and then the guru gives them some sort of a mantra,

00:11:08.834 --> 00:11:11.250
and they accept that mantra, they go on saying.

00:11:11.458 --> 00:11:15.166
As a result of that they catch more on the left Vishuddhi.

00:11:15.375 --> 00:11:18.417
Because if you go on saying mantra without the connection,

00:11:18.625 --> 00:11:20.959
you get completely caught-up.

00:11:21.125 --> 00:11:23.333
So the left Vishuddhi is again gone

00:11:23.583 --> 00:11:27.000
and your mantras are absolutely useless, they're destroying them.

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:30.792
Actually many people I've seen who get to heart attacks,

00:11:30.999 --> 00:11:36.166
who get anginas and also who get cancer

00:11:36.375 --> 00:11:38.542
are the people who have been doing mantras like this,

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:41.417
without the connection with the Divine.

00:11:41.667 --> 00:11:44.291
If you're not connected, say for example this is not connected

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:47.291
and I start using it too much, it will get spoilt.

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:50.834
In the same way the centre on the left hand side gets spoilt

00:11:51.041 --> 00:11:56.208
when you start saying any mantra without being connected,

00:11:56.417 --> 00:12:00.917
without feeling the power of that mantra.

00:12:01.583 --> 00:12:03.750
So in Sahaja Yoga we've got mantras

00:12:03.959 --> 00:12:06.709
to neutralise these mantras on the left hand side.

00:12:06.959 --> 00:12:09.291
Right hand side comes when we talk big.

00:12:09.542 --> 00:12:12.834
It's a common thing with your politicians, they talk very big.

00:12:13.041 --> 00:12:14.750
They think they're very responsible people

00:12:14.959 --> 00:12:17.041
and do all irresponsible things.

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:19.792
So when you want to spoil that chakra,

00:12:19.999 --> 00:12:23.999
one has to do some irresponsible talk.

00:12:24.166 --> 00:12:28.625
So like that we can say, "I will do this for you, I will do that.

00:12:28.875 --> 00:12:34.750
I like it, I can find this, I can manage this," finished.

00:12:35.542 --> 00:12:38.542
When you start saying in the ego form that,

00:12:38.792 --> 00:12:43.999
"I have to do this, I will do this," then our ego shows up.

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:48.333
But on the contrary, if you say, "I have to do for you, Father;

00:12:48.583 --> 00:12:52.417
I have to do for you, Mother, it's your work I'm doing,"

00:12:52.709 --> 00:12:54.291
then the whole thing disappears

00:12:54.542 --> 00:12:58.583
and you get that beautiful thing called surrender which is Islam.

00:12:58.834 --> 00:13:01.250
Islam is nothing but surrender.

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:05.291
So you surrender yourself by saying, "This is your work, Father;

00:13:05.542 --> 00:13:10.250
I'm working for you, I'm your instrument, I'm your flute."

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:13.291
So you play the melody of God.

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:17.792
But for that also the central point of discretion has to be used.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.333
Every time you go back to discretion.

00:13:20.542 --> 00:13:22.999
Like some people do all kinds of wrong things

00:13:23.208 --> 00:13:26.250
and they say, "Mother, we did it for you." How can it be?

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.083
Like somebody wants to drink.

00:13:28.291 --> 00:13:33.625
He says, "I got drunk because Mother I wanted to help you."

00:13:34.583 --> 00:13:37.583
Or Hitler can say that, "I killed so many people

00:13:37.875 --> 00:13:42.667
because I wanted to remove all the Jews who killed Christ."

00:13:43.333 --> 00:13:48.083
So this right Vishuddhi gives you a kind of a mind

00:13:48.417 --> 00:13:54.125
which tries to justify everything and tries to explain everything.

00:13:54.333 --> 00:13:57.375
Every action can be explained. "Why did you murder?" "Because this."

00:13:57.625 --> 00:13:59.333
"Why did you do that?" "Because of this."

00:13:59.583 --> 00:14:02.458
Once you start justifying your wrong deeds,

00:14:02.667 --> 00:14:05.583
right Vishuddhi goes up to your brain.

00:14:05.834 --> 00:14:08.500
And then whatever you do has a justification.

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:13.999
Like, if I say that the Americans came to this country,

00:14:14.166 --> 00:14:16.083
they actually robbed the other people of their land

00:14:16.291 --> 00:14:18.667
and now very nicely settled down.

00:14:18.917 --> 00:14:20.125
Now, when I say that,

00:14:20.375 --> 00:14:22.875
immediately most of them will go to the left Vishuddhi.

00:14:23.083 --> 00:14:27.083
"Oh, we are very guilty, we did this, we did that."

00:14:27.375 --> 00:14:29.625
But a real Sahaja Yogi won't do that.

00:14:29.875 --> 00:14:32.250
A real Sahaja Yogi, what he will do, he'll say, "Alright,

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:35.250
this is done by my fore-fathers, I did not do it.

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:40.792
But I can try to rectify it, I'll try to be beyond racialism;

00:14:40.999 --> 00:14:43.542
I'll look after these people who have been robbed,

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:46.250
I'll try to give them whatever is possible."

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:49.667
This is the way you face and not just to say,

00:14:49.875 --> 00:14:54.125
"Oh, I'm so guilty that my fore-fathers did this and all that."

00:14:54.375 --> 00:14:56.625
But what are you doing about it?

00:14:56.875 --> 00:15:00.417
Like I went to Switzerland and I said, "Don't feel guilty."

00:15:00.625 --> 00:15:04.125
So one lady said that "I'm feeling guilty for Vietnam."

00:15:04.375 --> 00:15:06.458
I said, "What did you do there?

00:15:06.709 --> 00:15:09.083
Why are you feeling guilty for Vietnam, of all the things,

00:15:09.333 --> 00:15:11.750
at least you did not go to fight there.

00:15:11.959 --> 00:15:13.583
Why did you feel guilty about it."

00:15:13.834 --> 00:15:15.959
So she says, "I'm feeling just guilty

00:15:16.125 --> 00:15:21.083
because I think we have done a wrong thing."

00:15:21.375 --> 00:15:23.750
I said, "But how do call yourself 'we'?"

00:15:23.959 --> 00:15:28.333
So this is also another point which comes out of indiscretion

00:15:28.542 --> 00:15:33.458
that we suddenly become a personality

00:15:33.709 --> 00:15:36.834
which is a part and parcel of the whole.

00:15:37.083 --> 00:15:41.875
So we think that "Oh, we Americans are of the world."

00:15:42.041 --> 00:15:45.083
Alright, how?

00:15:45.458 --> 00:15:50.291
The day you become the world most of the problems will be solved.

00:15:50.583 --> 00:15:54.208
They're the greatest headaches, like Russians are.

00:15:54.458 --> 00:15:56.999
Both are headaches to the whole world.

00:15:57.208 --> 00:16:00.375
If they become the whole world, there's no problem,

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:04.542
there's no problem, because then they become the love.

00:16:04.875 --> 00:16:11.291
But just assuming a situation where we think, we are, we.

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:16.500
Who are the 'we'?  Husband and wife can't live together.

00:16:16.792 --> 00:16:19.166
Children and father cannot live together.

00:16:19.375 --> 00:16:21.125
Mother cannot live with the children.

00:16:21.333 --> 00:16:24.417
What are 'we'? Where are 'we'?

00:16:24.667 --> 00:16:28.709
Such fragmentations. They'll fight over small things

00:16:28.959 --> 00:16:33.834
like a pen-knife or something, which pen-knife to be bought.

00:16:34.083 --> 00:16:36.083
For that they will fight. How are they 'we'?

00:16:36.291 --> 00:16:38.583
There's no unison, there is no concord.

00:16:38.834 --> 00:16:42.500
Just the opposite of all that is the Vishuddhi chakra.

00:16:42.709 --> 00:16:47.083
So from the very beginning, if you see that a person

00:16:47.291 --> 00:16:52.750
who is a realised soul should see everything as a play.

00:16:52.999 --> 00:16:56.166
Even the destruction of evil is important,

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:59.583
even the killing of the evil is important.

00:16:59.834 --> 00:17:03.250
If you do not kill the evil, the evil will rule.

00:17:03.458 --> 00:17:04.875
Do you think Hitler should have been saved

00:17:05.041 --> 00:17:09.166
and should have been put in charge of God?

00:17:10.333 --> 00:17:12.625
He's saved by killing him.

00:17:12.875 --> 00:17:14.625
Because he was destroyed,

00:17:14.834 --> 00:17:19.750
because everything was destroyed, he's saved.

00:17:20.208 --> 00:17:23.500
This is to be understood in his life, Krishna's life,

00:17:23.709 --> 00:17:26.999
that this is first thing happens, so that for you people,

00:17:27.166 --> 00:17:29.500
evil is to be finished.

00:17:29.792 --> 00:17:30.875
So what you have to pray

00:17:31.041 --> 00:17:33.875
that, "O Lord, finish all the evil of the world,

00:17:34.083 --> 00:17:38.583
all the destruction of the world,

00:17:38.792 --> 00:17:42.333
all the minds which build up our destruction,

00:17:42.542 --> 00:17:45.166
please try to neutralise it."

00:17:45.375 --> 00:17:47.709
This is what a Sahaja Yogi should ask for.

00:17:47.917 --> 00:17:48.709
Instead of that,

00:17:48.917 --> 00:17:53.875
they try to sometimes identify themselves with these ideas.

00:17:54.083 --> 00:17:56.208
That's not correct . You have to stand up

00:17:56.458 --> 00:17:58.375
and you have to say that it's wrong,

00:17:58.625 --> 00:18:01.999
"We are not to destroy anyone, we are not to kill anybody,

00:18:02.208 --> 00:18:03.500
we have no right."

00:18:03.709 --> 00:18:08.250
So when Krishna told Arjuna that "You kill everyone

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:11.000
who are related to you, who are your friends

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:16.291
and who look like your gurus, but they're already dead."

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.667
It was Shri Krishna who said,

00:18:18.959 --> 00:18:23.166
it was the incarnation of Shri Krishna said it.

00:18:23.417 --> 00:18:25.709
That doesn't that you start killing everybody,

00:18:25.917 --> 00:18:30.999
becoming Arjuna, you're not Arjuna.

00:18:32.041 --> 00:18:36.041
That is how Anand Marg, this thing organisation came up,

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:38.291
which started killing everyone,

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:42.542
thinking that they have a right to kill. How?

00:18:42.917 --> 00:18:44.500
You have no sense of right and wrong.

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:48.166
How can you kill anyone or how can you save any.

00:18:48.375 --> 00:18:50.667
First of all try to save instead of killing.

00:18:50.917 --> 00:18:55.375
Supposing you are faced with a boat which is in danger,

00:18:55.583 --> 00:18:56.917
people are getting drowned

00:18:57.083 --> 00:18:59.250
and you find that you have to save the people.

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:03.333
Will you kill the people there or you try to salvage them?

00:19:03.542 --> 00:19:05.458
There is no occasion for killing now.

00:19:05.667 --> 00:19:08.709
You don't have to worry about killing, let God do that job.

00:19:08.917 --> 00:19:11.375
What you have to do is to save people,

00:19:11.583 --> 00:19:15.667
you have to save as many as possible all the time.

00:19:15.917 --> 00:19:20.458
And those who are wrong type of people, you just forget about them.

00:19:20.709 --> 00:19:23.917
You just move them out. Take them away.

00:19:24.166 --> 00:19:25.291
Have nothing to do with them.

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:28.667
Do what you like, but do not kill them.

00:19:28.917 --> 00:19:32.542
So that is one thing one has to understand as Sahaja Yogis,

00:19:32.792 --> 00:19:36.375
that you are not here to kill anyone, to destroy anyone,

00:19:36.625 --> 00:19:40.291
to trouble anyone or to do something that is not proper.

00:19:40.542 --> 00:19:43.875
Even there is no need to say harsh words.

00:19:44.208 --> 00:19:47.208
God is going to look after. He's so anxious today,

00:19:47.417 --> 00:19:51.667
you are on the stage and He's so anxious to help you in every way

00:19:51.875 --> 00:19:54.208
because you're doing His work. But doing His work

00:19:54.417 --> 00:19:55.125
you don't take up

00:19:55.333 --> 00:19:59.000
His sword into your hands and start killing everyone.

00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:02.166
That's a very common thing we do it, in Sahaja Yoga,

00:20:02.375 --> 00:20:04.500
I've seen people become very aggressive,

00:20:04.709 --> 00:20:06.333
they talk very aggressively.

00:20:06.542 --> 00:20:09.667
Specially the new-comers who come in, in a programme.

00:20:09.917 --> 00:20:13.750
Instead of being kind, nice, compassionate, good to them,

00:20:13.959 --> 00:20:16.458
immediately they'll say, "You're a bhoot!"

00:20:16.709 --> 00:20:19.500
Very common.

00:20:20.709 --> 00:20:25.125
You won't find me doing that anytime, do I?

00:20:25.583 --> 00:20:27.999
Then you start aggressing each other also,

00:20:28.166 --> 00:20:31.000
which is against the principle of Vishuddhi.

00:20:31.208 --> 00:20:32.125
You're not to aggress.

00:20:32.333 --> 00:20:35.083
You see, because whole thing becomes discretion.

00:20:35.291 --> 00:20:38.417
What is discretion is diplomacy.

00:20:38.709 --> 00:20:41.834
The divine diplomacy is expressed through your discretion.

00:20:42.041 --> 00:20:44.083
If you have a sense of discretion, now you know -

00:20:44.291 --> 00:20:46.000
this man is dangerous,

00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:47.625
he is troubling you,

00:20:47.834 --> 00:20:49.500
now if you have a proper sense,

00:20:49.709 --> 00:20:53.125
you will remove that person in such a way from amidst yourself

00:20:53.375 --> 00:20:58.166
that there won't be any more discussion, or destruction.

00:20:58.375 --> 00:21:03.000
But on the contrary, what you do is to challenge that person,

00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:05.999
and a big fight starts. And Sahaja Yogis can fight,

00:21:06.208 --> 00:21:10.542
I tell you sometimes I don't know what to say about their fights.

00:21:10.917 --> 00:21:12.917
So must have discretion, must understand.

00:21:13.083 --> 00:21:16.083
A situation develops, for example, a situation develops

00:21:16.291 --> 00:21:18.166
where you find somebody is telling you,

00:21:18.375 --> 00:21:21.083
"You see, this person has said this about you."

00:21:21.333 --> 00:21:23.834
Then the same person goes and tells another person,

00:21:24.041 --> 00:21:26.542
"That person has said this about you."

00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:28.458
Then you start quarelling.

00:21:28.667 --> 00:21:32.834
Instead of finding out the basic reason, instead of finding out,

00:21:32.999 --> 00:21:35.959
"Why, why this is happening,

00:21:36.166 --> 00:21:38.625
why such a situation has come between ourselves.

00:21:38.875 --> 00:21:40.417
We were friends, what has happened?"

00:21:40.625 --> 00:21:43.542
Instead of that, one starts fighting, getting angry.

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:50.083
That's not the sign of any realised soul expression.

00:21:50.333 --> 00:21:55.083
Realised souls expressions have to be extremely discreet,

00:21:55.333 --> 00:21:57.375
delicate, beautiful.

00:21:57.583 --> 00:22:01.250
Nobody should notice

00:22:01.458 --> 00:22:07.542
that you have been in any way effective,

00:22:09.125 --> 00:22:11.458
and that's how you'll work it out.

00:22:11.667 --> 00:22:14.500
So the incarnation of Shri Krishna as we say

00:22:14.709 --> 00:22:18.250
is the incarnation of the divine diplomacy.

00:22:18.667 --> 00:22:21.125
So he plays.

00:22:21.333 --> 00:22:23.375
Give you an example how he plays.

00:22:23.583 --> 00:22:28.959
There was a rakshasa, a devil,

00:22:29.333 --> 00:22:34.417
who had a blessing from Shiva

00:22:34.667 --> 00:22:40.750
that nobody can kill him.

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:47.542
And only a saint who has never opened his eyes all his life,

00:22:47.917 --> 00:22:51.291
if he puts his eyes on him, he will be killed.

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:56.208
So there was a saint who had a blessing

00:22:56.542 --> 00:23:00.125
that you go into your yoga, yoga nidra,

00:23:00.333 --> 00:23:04.250
sleep in your yoga sleep,

00:23:04.458 --> 00:23:07.333
and once you open your eyes

00:23:07.542 --> 00:23:13.000
on whomsoever it will fall, such a person will die.

00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:18.500
Alright, so Shri Krishna was very clever.

00:23:18.792 --> 00:23:21.667
He was fighting this devil

00:23:21.875 --> 00:23:25.542
and this devil was about to kill Shri Krishna.

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:29.583
And Shri Krishna knew all about this, his background.

00:23:29.999 --> 00:23:32.750
So he started running away from the field,

00:23:32.999 --> 00:23:34.999
so he's got a name called Ranchodas,

00:23:35.166 --> 00:23:37.750
the one who runs away from the battle field,

00:23:37.999 --> 00:23:40.583
is regarded as something really derogatory,

00:23:40.792 --> 00:23:44.417
because it's not something great to run away from the battle field.

00:23:44.667 --> 00:23:45.542
So he didn't mind,

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:49.375
he ran away and then this devil started following him

00:23:49.583 --> 00:23:50.709
And he went into the cave

00:23:50.917 --> 00:23:55.041
where this great saint was sleeping in his yoga nidra.

00:23:55.709 --> 00:23:58.667
And he removed his shawl

00:23:58.875 --> 00:24:02.999
and put it slowly, delicately, on that saint

00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:04.959
and hid himself.

00:24:05.166 --> 00:24:07.208
So this rakshasa came behind him.

00:24:07.417 --> 00:24:11.083
He saw him lying down there. He thought this was Shri Krishna.

00:24:11.333 --> 00:24:14.999
He said, "Ah so now you're tired, you're lying down here.

00:24:15.208 --> 00:24:17.250
Come along now, open your eyes!"

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:23.458
And as soon as he pulled the shawl with little strength,

00:24:23.709 --> 00:24:26.500
this fellow got up and his eyes looked at him

00:24:26.709 --> 00:24:29.750
and he just was burnt.

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:36.542
And he did not mind getting the bad name of Ranchodas.

00:24:36.834 --> 00:24:40.125
That is the sign of diplomacy.

00:24:40.333 --> 00:24:45.542
So the whole discretion of his is plain throughout his life,

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:48.333
the whole discretion, what he should do,

00:24:48.542 --> 00:24:50.250
what is right, what is wrong,

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:54.041
is he doesn't have this problem.

00:24:54.333 --> 00:24:59.166
Then he had to have his powers, all of them brought on this earth.

00:24:59.417 --> 00:25:00.917
So he played a trick .

00:25:01.083 --> 00:25:06.875
He got all those powers in the form of women, young women.

00:25:07.417 --> 00:25:13.083
And he made one king - you see-

00:25:14.041 --> 00:25:21.333
drag these women into his own court for him to use them.

00:25:21.542 --> 00:25:24.041
But he could never touch them.

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:27.083
So Shri Krishna went and defeated this man.

00:25:27.291 --> 00:25:29.208
He has to have justification also,

00:25:29.417 --> 00:25:32.000
he has to have a religious justification for doing something.

00:25:32.333 --> 00:25:34.917
So he killed this king, brought all these women

00:25:35.125 --> 00:25:40.999
and they all became his wives, so-called.

00:25:42.542 --> 00:25:44.667
All kinds of tricks he used to play.

00:25:44.875 --> 00:25:47.375
I'll tell you the Radha's trick that he played.

00:25:47.583 --> 00:25:50.834
Today I'm wearing a dress like Radha because she's Viratangana,

00:25:51.083 --> 00:25:54.000
she's the one who protects our Sushumna Nadi.

00:25:54.291 --> 00:25:58.291
She's the Mahalakshmi and she wears the sari like this to protect.

00:25:58.542 --> 00:26:01.999
She wears this way, while she leaves her left hand open

00:26:02.166 --> 00:26:06.333
because this is the Shakti of Mahakali and the right hand she closes

00:26:06.542 --> 00:26:10.667
because the right hand is the Shakti of Mahasaraswati,

00:26:10.917 --> 00:26:13.999
meaning the power of creation,

00:26:14.208 --> 00:26:16.291
because creation has been done already.

00:26:16.542 --> 00:26:19.500
She's created the earth and she's created human beings,

00:26:19.709 --> 00:26:21.542
everything is done . Now that is stopped.

00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:23.709
And in India, Brahmadeva is not worshipped

00:26:23.917 --> 00:26:27.125
except there's one temple where they worship Brahmadeva,

00:26:27.333 --> 00:26:30.333
otherwise Brahmadeva has no temple or anything.

00:26:30.583 --> 00:26:33.709
So she closes this side, she preserves it within herself

00:26:33.959 --> 00:26:35.667
and she opens her left side.

00:26:35.917 --> 00:26:37.750
And in front of her

00:26:37.999 --> 00:26:41.999
is the complete protection made for all her disciples.

00:26:42.208 --> 00:26:44.875
This is the whole big 'archal' she makes,

00:26:45.041 --> 00:26:47.333
normally the 'archal' is other side of it,

00:26:47.542 --> 00:26:51.792
where the child is kept inside, hidden in other sari.

00:26:51.999 --> 00:26:54.917
But in this one, the one that they have here

00:26:55.125 --> 00:26:57.041
is the child is kept underneath this,

00:26:57.291 --> 00:27:00.583
so the whole ascent takes place of Mahalakshmi.

00:27:00.792 --> 00:27:04.792
And that's why this is the Radha's powers is shown.

00:27:04.999 --> 00:27:07.792
So I'll tell you the last story about her

00:27:07.999 --> 00:27:14.417
which will conclude this talk about

00:27:14.667 --> 00:27:16.375
Radha and Shri Krishna.

00:27:16.625 --> 00:27:19.041
That one day,

00:27:19.875 --> 00:27:25.500
one of the wives of Shri Krishna was befooled by Narada,

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:27.458
and Narada said, "See,

00:27:27.709 --> 00:27:30.166
Krishna doesn't love you, he only loves Radha.

00:27:30.375 --> 00:27:32.667
He's just telling you stories that he loves you,

00:27:32.875 --> 00:27:37.500
that you are his wives but he is not. He is only attached to Radha."

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:42.417
So the rumour, you see, went into the women.

00:27:42.667 --> 00:27:46.375
All of them started feeling that, "O really, it is so."

00:27:46.583 --> 00:27:49.625
So they went and told Shri Krishna that

00:27:49.834 --> 00:27:52.750
"You don't love us, you just love Radha."

00:27:52.959 --> 00:27:54.625
He said, "Who told you?" They said, "Narada."

00:27:54.834 --> 00:27:57.917
"No, no, who told you this." They said, "Narada."

00:27:58.083 --> 00:27:59.500
He said, "Narada is just telling you lies, you see,

00:27:59.709 --> 00:28:03.417
he is just trying to make some quarrel between you and me,

00:28:03.625 --> 00:28:05.375
so don't listen to him."

00:28:05.583 --> 00:28:07.709
They said, "No, no, it's true, we can prove it."

00:28:07.959 --> 00:28:09.500
He said, "Alright. I don't know that,

00:28:09.709 --> 00:28:11.667
but just now I got terrible pain in the stomach,

00:28:11.875 --> 00:28:15.208
terrible pain, I can't get over it." So they got all worried.

00:28:15.417 --> 00:28:18.999
They said, "What's the matter, what sort of a pain it is,

00:28:19.208 --> 00:28:22.166
what can we do to overcome this pain."

00:28:22.375 --> 00:28:24.125
He said, "There's very simple thing that

00:28:24.333 --> 00:28:29.041
you'll have to give me the dust of your feet to drink.

00:28:29.291 --> 00:28:32.834
If you can take out the dust of your feet and give me to drink,

00:28:33.041 --> 00:28:34.625
then I'll be saved."

00:28:34.834 --> 00:28:38.250
So these ladies used their brains. They said that

00:28:38.458 --> 00:28:39.999
"Already he doesn't love us

00:28:40.208 --> 00:28:42.208
and then if we give him the dust of our feet

00:28:42.417 --> 00:28:46.166
we'll be committing sins and then it is going to be much worse.

00:28:46.375 --> 00:28:49.250
So what's the use of playing into his hands, he's very diplomatic,

00:28:49.458 --> 00:28:50.917
it's better to forget about it."

00:28:51.083 --> 00:28:53.417
They said, "No, no, no we don't want to do such a sinful thing,

00:28:53.625 --> 00:28:57.000
is to give you the dust of our feet, it's non-protocolish,

00:28:57.208 --> 00:29:00.208
we have nothing to do like that, you don't teach us all bad things."

00:29:00.417 --> 00:29:03.458
So they stopped it. So Narada came, he said, "Now what to do,

00:29:03.667 --> 00:29:05.959
how to get rid of your pain in the stomach."

00:29:06.166 --> 00:29:08.458
He said, "There's only way out, you go to Radha

00:29:08.667 --> 00:29:11.000
and tell her that I've got a pain in the stomach

00:29:11.208 --> 00:29:13.875
and this is the medicine." So he went to Radhaji

00:29:14.041 --> 00:29:17.083
and he said to her that,

00:29:17.291 --> 00:29:20.375
"You see, Shri Krishna is very sick, he's got pain in the stomach

00:29:20.583 --> 00:29:25.583
and what you have to do is to give the dust of your feet."

00:29:26.125 --> 00:29:28.625
She said, "Yes, why not, take it,

00:29:28.959 --> 00:29:31.667
for that pain, of course, why not?"

00:29:32.458 --> 00:29:38.083
So he said, "Aren't you worried about your punyas,

00:29:38.333 --> 00:29:40.291
aren't you worried that you're committing sin."

00:29:40.542 --> 00:29:42.625
She said, "You don't know this Shri Krishna,

00:29:42.875 --> 00:29:44.625
he has no sense of sin at all.

00:29:44.875 --> 00:29:46.917
He makes me do sin morning till evening,

00:29:47.125 --> 00:29:48.458
what am I to worry about sins.

00:29:48.667 --> 00:29:51.834
I'm not going to worry about that, you better take this for him,

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.125
this is his worry."

00:29:53.417 --> 00:29:55.959
So he took the dust of Radha's feet

00:29:56.125 --> 00:29:58.458
and took it down to Shri Krishna.

00:29:58.709 --> 00:30:01.500
Shri Krishna: "Did she give you." He said, "Did she give you?"

00:30:01.709 --> 00:30:03.875
He said, "Yes, she has, I'm surprised,

00:30:04.083 --> 00:30:07.375
but she's not worried about her sins, she's not worried."

00:30:07.625 --> 00:30:10.458
He said, "That I know." So he said, "But how do you explain it?"

00:30:10.667 --> 00:30:12.375
He said, "You'll understand just now."

00:30:12.667 --> 00:30:14.959
He took the dust of Radha's feet,

00:30:15.166 --> 00:30:20.166
you see Radha's feet were dusted

00:30:20.375 --> 00:30:22.375
or were full of dust of Vrindavan,

00:30:22.583 --> 00:30:28.834
and Vrindavan has got yellow kind of clay,

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.500
you see, the soil is yellowish

00:30:31.709 --> 00:30:35.875
and the whole yellow thing was on her feet

00:30:36.041 --> 00:30:38.333
which she removed and took it.

00:30:38.542 --> 00:30:43.583
So when Shri Krishna drank that dust,

00:30:44.041 --> 00:30:47.625
Narada saw in the heart of Shri Krishna,

00:30:47.834 --> 00:30:52.583
Radha was lying down and playing with her feet

00:30:52.834 --> 00:30:54.875
on the lotus of his heart.

00:30:55.041 --> 00:31:01.041
The lotus had the pollen,

00:31:01.542 --> 00:31:03.583
the pollen of the lotus was touching her feet

00:31:03.792 --> 00:31:05.458
and was making it yellow.

00:31:05.792 --> 00:31:09.166
That's what she said that "What is it when I'm in his heart,

00:31:09.375 --> 00:31:15.375
my feet are in his heart, so what is the sin I can commit?"

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:22.000
And when the ladies heard this, they realised that

00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:25.208
their idea about Shri Krishna is still not sufficient.

00:31:25.458 --> 00:31:28.792
They have to be Radha to understand him.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.250
And this is how he plays diplomacy,

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:34.208
simple tricks here and there by which he did it.

00:31:34.458 --> 00:31:40.083
And to introduce the beauty of Leela, he started Ras;

00:31:40.291 --> 00:31:43.500
Ra is energy, Sa means 'with'.

00:31:43.792 --> 00:31:46.917
So he made Radha dance, stand there with him,

00:31:47.125 --> 00:31:49.709
give him the the power and everybody danced.

00:31:49.959 --> 00:31:53.500
And they looked like as if Radha and Krishna dancing.

00:31:53.792 --> 00:31:57.208
And this is what he started, and then to make it, culminate it,

00:31:57.417 --> 00:32:01.458
he made a festival of Holi in which he said, "Abandon everything!

00:32:01.709 --> 00:32:03.542
For a minute you abandon everything."

00:32:03.792 --> 00:32:06.625
And that abandonment has now become a,

00:32:06.875 --> 00:32:08.750
that's for only one day you have to abandon,

00:32:08.959 --> 00:32:12.750
here it has become a year-long Holi.

00:32:12.999 --> 00:32:14.834
So people are busy with a year-long Holi

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.709
without Shri Krishna and Radha.

00:32:16.959 --> 00:32:20.166
So what will be the situation of such a place?

00:32:20.375 --> 00:32:22.999
And that's why I think, what happens that

00:32:23.166 --> 00:32:27.041
when you try to attract others by all these stupid things,

00:32:27.291 --> 00:32:30.291
only the bhoots are attracted and they get into you.

00:32:30.542 --> 00:32:33.542
And once they get into you, you get funny,

00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:35.250
you don't know why you behave like this,

00:32:35.458 --> 00:32:37.834
why things work out that way.

00:32:38.083 --> 00:32:39.999
This is why we have to understand

00:32:40.166 --> 00:32:42.834
that we have to be attractive to God.

00:32:43.041 --> 00:32:47.375
And you'll be only attractive to God if you have got your spirit.

00:32:47.667 --> 00:32:51.375
If the spirit is shining, then only you can get into it.

00:32:51.875 --> 00:32:54.542
So May God Bless You.
