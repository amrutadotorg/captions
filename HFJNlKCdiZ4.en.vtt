WEBVTT

00:01.792 --> 00:03.500
who was just a fisherman.

00:03.750 --> 00:06.166
He wrote Ramayana, he was a great Brahmin.

00:06.417 --> 00:09.333
Then you have got Vyasa who wrote Gita.

00:09.542 --> 00:16.583
He was an illegitimate son of a fisherwoman and he wrote Gita.

00:17.041 --> 00:23.667
So this idea was flouted by Shri Krishna's incarnation.

00:24.208 --> 00:28.709
He wanted to flout this idea that Brahmins are the ones

00:28.917 --> 00:31.917
who can only worship God.

00:32.291 --> 00:38.083
So to put another extreme

00:38.333 --> 00:42.291
to what Rama has created,

00:42.999 --> 00:45.208
to bring people into the centre,

00:45.417 --> 00:49.250
because through Rama they went to another rigid form

00:49.583 --> 00:51.667
and rigidity of ritualism

00:51.999 --> 00:57.750
and too much of fundamentalism.

00:58.041 --> 00:59.750
So to put an end to that

00:59.999 --> 01:02.792
he wanted to bring the society to another extreme.

01:02.999 --> 01:08.834
Of course Shri Rama himself incarnated as Shri Krishna.

01:09.166 --> 01:13.583
So he started a new theme of,

01:13.792 --> 01:20.000
which was absolutely eventual, it was just absolutely evolutionary

01:20.208 --> 01:22.625
that such a new theme should come up.

01:22.875 --> 01:27.834
And this new theme was that the whole thing is nothing but a Leela.

01:28.500 --> 01:31.000
It's just a play, it's a Leela.

01:31.250 --> 01:34.792
So not to be taken that seriously, not to be so rigid,

01:34.999 --> 01:41.458
not to be fundamental, not to be so particular about something.

01:41.792 --> 01:44.166
So the whole thing is a Leela.

01:44.417 --> 01:48.792
And on this theme he worked out everything

01:49.083 --> 01:52.125
to establish that it is a play.

01:52.834 --> 01:55.792
And that is what you see in America,

01:55.999 --> 01:59.125
very common that for people it has become a joke,

01:59.375 --> 02:01.917
life has become a joke.

02:02.166 --> 02:04.875
And they think that life is not to be taken seriously,

02:05.083 --> 02:09.125
there is more fun in doing all kinds of things

02:09.375 --> 02:15.250
than in getting into any kind of inhibitions, as they call it,

02:15.500 --> 02:20.999
or maybe some sort of forms or patterns.

02:21.333 --> 02:24.208
But it is a myth with Americans now

02:24.417 --> 02:27.250
because for that you have to have Shri Krishna,

02:27.500 --> 02:29.291
you have to have realisation.

02:29.542 --> 02:32.333
Like if you are standing in the water,

02:32.625 --> 02:39.542
the waves of the water are there absolutely real for you and you,

02:40.750 --> 02:45.458
if you think it's a illusion you'll be completely finished.

02:46.125 --> 02:49.583
The illusion will prove that it's not an illusion

02:49.792 --> 02:51.875
by asserting itself.

02:52.083 --> 02:53.999
But if you're in the boat

02:54.250 --> 02:58.125
then the water that is around is an illusion.

02:58.375 --> 03:00.834
So it's the state at which you are.

03:01.083 --> 03:05.500
If you are in the state of self-realised mind,

03:05.709 --> 03:10.083
then everything is an illusion, but otherwise it is not.

03:10.333 --> 03:14.166
It is a reality. So what they forgot this point,

03:14.375 --> 03:17.417
that you are not in that state to call it an illusion.

03:17.709 --> 03:21.542
So to call everything an illusion is just to delude yourself,

03:21.999 --> 03:23.291
thinking that it's an illusion

03:23.500 --> 03:27.500
and doesn't matter, what's wrong, so what.

03:28.875 --> 03:31.625
It's quite symbolic that in Shri Krishna's place

03:31.834 --> 03:33.166
this thing should be so

03:33.375 --> 03:36.750
commonly accepted that everything is an illusion.

03:36.959 --> 03:40.166
So who is wrong, who is bad, nothing is wrong.

03:40.375 --> 03:44.166
There is nothing like evil, nothing like good.

03:44.458 --> 03:46.583
And some people go to that limit to say

03:46.792 --> 03:49.542
that there's nothing like a bhoot, nothing like a rakshasa,

03:49.792 --> 03:52.041
nothing like a evil force.

03:52.333 --> 03:55.999
Now for Shri Krishna how did he look at things was this way

03:56.208 --> 04:02.041
that for him even to kill a rakshasa was a play.

04:02.792 --> 04:07.333
To destroy a rakshasa was also a play.

04:08.166 --> 04:12.083
In that play he was to be destroyed.

04:12.750 --> 04:18.166
So he discriminated in a way that what play is to be destroyed,

04:18.375 --> 04:20.792
what not to be destroyed.

04:20.999 --> 04:24.417
The play of the evil he destroyed by his own play.

04:24.667 --> 04:27.250
So to say there was nothing evil is also wrong.

04:27.458 --> 04:30.625
Like even if you think everything is a play,

04:30.834 --> 04:35.041
what happens that your attitude towards it is like a spectator.

04:35.333 --> 04:38.083
You see the whole thing as a spectator,

04:38.333 --> 04:39.875
like in a drama you sit down

04:40.083 --> 04:42.166
and you watch everything as a spectator,

04:42.417 --> 04:48.333
but you know what is depicting tragedy and what is depicting comedy.

04:48.750 --> 04:52.834
You are not inert to that then you are good for nothing.

04:53.041 --> 04:56.208
That doesn't mean that you become inert to that.

04:56.500 --> 04:58.875
You have a sense of discretion to know

04:59.041 --> 05:01.625
what is a comedy and what is a tragedy.

05:01.875 --> 05:06.417
But if you are an actor, then to you it is not,

05:06.959 --> 05:11.417
it is not a comedy or a tragedy, it is a work for you.

05:11.667 --> 05:14.834
If you're acting then you're acting and you're an actor,

05:15.041 --> 05:18.125
you're involved in it. So it is not,

05:18.458 --> 05:20.166
for you do not know the discretion

05:20.375 --> 05:21.999
between the tragedy and the comedy.

05:22.166 --> 05:25.250
For you, you're just an actor as long as you're paid well,

05:25.500 --> 05:28.999
if you do your job well, then it's a comedy,

05:29.166 --> 05:32.041
otherwise it's a tragedy.

05:32.583 --> 05:36.333
So there are two types of awareness, now of one of a spectator,

05:36.583 --> 05:40.166
another of the one who is in it.

05:40.500 --> 05:43.125
So one has to understand in that light,

05:43.417 --> 05:46.291
that when Krishna said the whole thing is a play,

05:46.500 --> 05:51.542
he was meaning for him, not for others.

05:52.083 --> 05:53.542
For him it is a play.

05:53.750 --> 05:57.542
And that's why when they talk to you about the play and the illusion

05:57.750 --> 06:00.917
you must tell them then why did he kill Kamsa.

06:01.083 --> 06:03.917
Why did he kill Jarasandha?

06:04.083 --> 06:09.417
Why did he kill all the people who were following Kamsa?

06:09.792 --> 06:13.041
So to him it was a play, everything was a play

06:13.250 --> 06:17.999
and he did it in his own attitude of a play.

06:18.458 --> 06:23.291
So the first thing if you are

06:23.625 --> 06:25.792
awakened by Shri Krishna's powers,

06:25.999 --> 06:30.291
then the first thing that should happen to you is wisdom.

06:30.834 --> 06:35.375
Now the wisdom is something you cannot describe.

06:35.583 --> 06:37.959
You cannot say what is wisdom.

06:38.166 --> 06:42.041
It's very difficult to describe it or to delimit it.

06:42.250 --> 06:45.625
Wisdom is a temperament,

06:45.875 --> 06:49.083
is a quality of a personality

06:49.458 --> 06:54.458
which comes to you by balancing yourself, by trial and error method.

06:54.709 --> 06:58.709
All traditional countries innately have much more wisdom than people

06:58.959 --> 07:00.709
who are not traditional.

07:00.959 --> 07:03.834
But Krishna broke all the traditions.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.125
That's why you people are here without much tradition.

07:07.375 --> 07:11.375
He broke all the traditions, but he was Shri Krishna,

07:11.583 --> 07:14.083
so he did not need any tradition at all.

07:14.291 --> 07:17.458
But for you, you have to understand from the people

07:17.667 --> 07:19.834
who have tradition what is wisdom.

07:20.041 --> 07:24.250
So we do trial and error. We make mistakes, from that we learn.

07:24.500 --> 07:29.792
But when the ego is so strong in a country like America,

07:29.999 --> 07:34.667
when we do wrong, we do not want to accept it was wrong,Â¨

07:34.917 --> 07:41.542
it was against our ascent, it was against our higher goals.

07:41.750 --> 07:43.583
We get satisfied with the lower goals,

07:43.834 --> 07:48.208
like I've seen people who do some funny things in Sahaja Yoga.

07:48.583 --> 07:52.291
They don't realise that this is absolutely against them,

07:52.667 --> 07:55.709
whatever they are doing is against them, they should not do this,

07:55.917 --> 07:58.458
it was wrong to do it. On the contrary,

07:58.667 --> 08:00.083
they catch on the left Vishuddhi

08:00.291 --> 08:03.542
that is another catch they have on the Vishuddhi chakra.

08:03.917 --> 08:07.875
So because you're indiscreet, you do wrong things.

08:08.125 --> 08:12.667
To develop discretion, outcome of all this is discretion.

08:12.875 --> 08:15.834
You make mistakes. When you make mistakes,

08:16.000 --> 08:16.959
instead of

08:17.125 --> 08:19.291
developing the discretionabout it that this was a mistake,

08:19.500 --> 08:22.083
next time we should not do it, facing up to it,

08:22.291 --> 08:25.999
what we do is to feel guilty about it, so you escape it,

08:26.166 --> 08:29.208
spoiling the other chakra also.

08:29.458 --> 08:37.125
That is how people get a problem on the left Vishuddhi,

08:37.667 --> 08:39.999
and left Vishuddhi is that you feel guilty.

08:40.208 --> 08:44.166
It's very good to feel guilty than to do anything about it.

08:44.709 --> 08:46.959
That's the best way to escape it.

08:47.208 --> 08:51.625
Actually we have seen that mostly left Vishuddhi comes from ego.

08:51.959 --> 08:54.542
When ego is too much, you can't bear your ego,

08:54.750 --> 08:57.500
so you put it in the guilty side of it,

08:57.709 --> 09:01.417
and you say, "I'm very guilty, I should not have done it."

09:01.709 --> 09:02.750
Now the another side

09:02.959 --> 09:05.792
which is also very dangerous is the right Vishuddhi.

09:05.999 --> 09:08.041
Right Vishuddhi is the one by which

09:08.291 --> 09:12.625
we try to justify all our indiscreet behaviour.

09:13.375 --> 09:16.166
So, "What's wrong?"

09:17.875 --> 09:21.583
"What is wrong in this?" "So what!"

09:22.125 --> 09:24.542
All these things are right Vishuddhi problems.

09:24.792 --> 09:29.166
So it's very common you tell somebody that it is wrong to do,

09:29.375 --> 09:31.542
for example they paint their hair.

09:31.792 --> 09:35.166
You tell them, "Don't do this, it will spoil your eyes,"

09:35.375 --> 09:40.333
they will say, "So what, we have a right to spoil ourselves,

09:40.667 --> 09:43.041
we have a right to destroy ourselves," as if they are Shri Krishna,

09:43.250 --> 09:46.250
that they can destroy themselves, can they?

09:46.500 --> 09:52.999
They cannot even create a little ant,

09:53.250 --> 09:56.917
leave alone ant, they can't even create a stone.

09:57.333 --> 09:59.667
And how do they have right to destroy themselves?

09:59.917 --> 10:01.333
So this is the right side thing

10:01.583 --> 10:07.875
where we think that we have the right to destroy.

10:09.500 --> 10:13.166
As I told you about eyes yesterday, it's very important

10:13.458 --> 10:17.792
that eyes are the ones

10:17.999 --> 10:20.834
which gives you the play of Shri Krishna,

10:21.291 --> 10:22.625
the power of Shri Krishna.

10:22.917 --> 10:28.125
Even a glance, a little glance of a person

10:28.333 --> 10:31.083
who has Krishna consciousness, as they call it,

10:31.291 --> 10:32.999
if he has Krishna consciousness,

10:33.166 --> 10:35.959
then should be able to awaken the Kundalini,

10:36.125 --> 10:39.542
should be able to redeem, should be able to comfort,

10:39.792 --> 10:41.208
should be able to cure anyone.

10:41.458 --> 10:44.083
Even a glance, a side glance can do it,

10:44.333 --> 10:46.125
if it has Krishna consciousness,

10:46.375 --> 10:50.208
but not self-certified ones who say, "We are Krishna consciousness,"

10:50.458 --> 10:54.750
all the time taking the name of Shri Krishna or any mantra.

10:54.999 --> 10:59.250
So on the left hand side the escape is feeling guilty.

10:59.500 --> 11:00.542
When you feel guilty,

11:00.792 --> 11:03.792
they try to find out some method of expression.

11:03.999 --> 11:05.792
So they say they go to some guru

11:05.999 --> 11:08.583
and then the guru gives them some sort of a mantra,

11:08.834 --> 11:11.250
and they accept that mantra, they go on saying.

11:11.458 --> 11:15.166
As a result of that they catch more on the left Vishuddhi.

11:15.375 --> 11:18.417
Because if you go on saying mantra without the connection,

11:18.625 --> 11:20.959
you get completely caught-up.

11:21.125 --> 11:23.333
So the left Vishuddhi is again gone

11:23.583 --> 11:27.000
and your mantras are absolutely useless, they're destroying them.

11:27.250 --> 11:30.792
Actually many people I've seen who get to heart attacks,

11:30.999 --> 11:36.166
who get anginas and also who get cancer

11:36.375 --> 11:38.542
are the people who have been doing mantras like this,

11:38.750 --> 11:41.417
without the connection with the Divine.

11:41.667 --> 11:44.291
If you're not connected, say for example this is not connected

11:44.500 --> 11:47.291
and I start using it too much, it will get spoilt.

11:47.500 --> 11:50.834
In the same way the centre on the left hand side gets spoilt

11:51.041 --> 11:56.208
when you start saying any mantra without being connected,

11:56.417 --> 12:00.917
without feeling the power of that mantra.

12:01.583 --> 12:03.750
So in Sahaja Yoga we've got mantras

12:03.959 --> 12:06.709
to neutralise these mantras on the left hand side.

12:06.959 --> 12:09.291
Right hand side comes when we talk big.

12:09.542 --> 12:12.834
It's a common thing with your politicians, they talk very big.

12:13.041 --> 12:14.750
They think they're very responsible people

12:14.959 --> 12:17.041
and do all irresponsible things.

12:17.250 --> 12:19.792
So when you want to spoil that chakra,

12:19.999 --> 12:23.999
one has to do some irresponsible talk.

12:24.166 --> 12:28.625
So like that we can say, "I will do this for you, I will do that.

12:28.875 --> 12:34.750
I like it, I can find this, I can manage this," finished.

12:35.542 --> 12:38.542
When you start saying in the ego form that,

12:38.792 --> 12:43.999
"I have to do this, I will do this," then our ego shows up.

12:44.250 --> 12:48.333
But on the contrary, if you say, "I have to do for you, Father;

12:48.583 --> 12:52.417
I have to do for you, Mother, it's your work I'm doing,"

12:52.709 --> 12:54.291
then the whole thing disappears

12:54.542 --> 12:58.583
and you get that beautiful thing called surrender which is Islam.

12:58.834 --> 13:01.250
Islam is nothing but surrender.

13:01.500 --> 13:05.291
So you surrender yourself by saying, "This is your work, Father;

13:05.542 --> 13:10.250
I'm working for you, I'm your instrument, I'm your flute."

13:10.500 --> 13:13.291
So you play the melody of God.

13:13.500 --> 13:17.792
But for that also the central point of discretion has to be used.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.333
Every time you go back to discretion.

13:20.542 --> 13:22.999
Like some people do all kinds of wrong things

13:23.208 --> 13:26.250
and they say, "Mother, we did it for you." How can it be?

13:26.500 --> 13:28.083
Like somebody wants to drink.

13:28.291 --> 13:33.625
He says, "I got drunk because Mother I wanted to help you."

13:34.583 --> 13:37.583
Or Hitler can say that, "I killed so many people

13:37.875 --> 13:42.667
because I wanted to remove all the Jews who killed Christ."

13:43.333 --> 13:48.083
So this right Vishuddhi gives you a kind of a mind

13:48.417 --> 13:54.125
which tries to justify everything and tries to explain everything.

13:54.333 --> 13:57.375
Every action can be explained. "Why did you murder?" "Because this."

13:57.625 --> 13:59.333
"Why did you do that?" "Because of this."

13:59.583 --> 14:02.458
Once you start justifying your wrong deeds,

14:02.667 --> 14:05.583
right Vishuddhi goes up to your brain.

14:05.834 --> 14:08.500
And then whatever you do has a justification.

14:08.750 --> 14:13.999
Like, if I say that the Americans came to this country,

14:14.166 --> 14:16.083
they actually robbed the other people of their land

14:16.291 --> 14:18.667
and now very nicely settled down.

14:18.917 --> 14:20.125
Now, when I say that,

14:20.375 --> 14:22.875
immediately most of them will go to the left Vishuddhi.

14:23.083 --> 14:27.083
"Oh, we are very guilty, we did this, we did that."

14:27.375 --> 14:29.625
But a real Sahaja Yogi won't do that.

14:29.875 --> 14:32.250
A real Sahaja Yogi, what he will do, he'll say, "Alright,

14:32.500 --> 14:35.250
this is done by my fore-fathers, I did not do it.

14:35.500 --> 14:40.792
But I can try to rectify it, I'll try to be beyond racialism;

14:40.999 --> 14:43.542
I'll look after these people who have been robbed,

14:43.750 --> 14:46.250
I'll try to give them whatever is possible."

14:46.500 --> 14:49.667
This is the way you face and not just to say,

14:49.875 --> 14:54.125
"Oh, I'm so guilty that my fore-fathers did this and all that."

14:54.375 --> 14:56.625
But what are you doing about it?

14:56.875 --> 15:00.417
Like I went to Switzerland and I said, "Don't feel guilty."

15:00.625 --> 15:04.125
So one lady said that "I'm feeling guilty for Vietnam."

15:04.375 --> 15:06.458
I said, "What did you do there?

15:06.709 --> 15:09.083
Why are you feeling guilty for Vietnam, of all the things,

15:09.333 --> 15:11.750
at least you did not go to fight there.

15:11.959 --> 15:13.583
Why did you feel guilty about it."

15:13.834 --> 15:15.959
So she says, "I'm feeling just guilty

15:16.125 --> 15:21.083
because I think we have done a wrong thing."

15:21.375 --> 15:23.750
I said, "But how do call yourself 'we'?"

15:23.959 --> 15:28.333
So this is also another point which comes out of indiscretion

15:28.542 --> 15:33.458
that we suddenly become a personality

15:33.709 --> 15:36.834
which is a part and parcel of the whole.

15:37.083 --> 15:41.875
So we think that "Oh, we Americans are of the world."

15:42.041 --> 15:45.083
Alright, how?

15:45.458 --> 15:50.291
The day you become the world most of the problems will be solved.

15:50.583 --> 15:54.208
They're the greatest headaches, like Russians are.

15:54.458 --> 15:56.999
Both are headaches to the whole world.

15:57.208 --> 16:00.375
If they become the whole world, there's no problem,

16:00.750 --> 16:04.542
there's no problem, because then they become the love.

16:04.875 --> 16:11.291
But just assuming a situation where we think, we are, we.

16:11.750 --> 16:16.500
Who are the 'we'?  Husband and wife can't live together.

16:16.792 --> 16:19.166
Children and father cannot live together.

16:19.375 --> 16:21.125
Mother cannot live with the children.

16:21.333 --> 16:24.417
What are 'we'? Where are 'we'?

16:24.667 --> 16:28.709
Such fragmentations. They'll fight over small things

16:28.959 --> 16:33.834
like a pen-knife or something, which pen-knife to be bought.

16:34.083 --> 16:36.083
For that they will fight. How are they 'we'?

16:36.291 --> 16:38.583
There's no unison, there is no concord.

16:38.834 --> 16:42.500
Just the opposite of all that is the Vishuddhi chakra.

16:42.709 --> 16:47.083
So from the very beginning, if you see that a person

16:47.291 --> 16:52.750
who is a realised soul should see everything as a play.

16:52.999 --> 16:56.166
Even the destruction of evil is important,

16:56.500 --> 16:59.583
even the killing of the evil is important.

16:59.834 --> 17:03.250
If you do not kill the evil, the evil will rule.

17:03.458 --> 17:04.875
Do you think Hitler should have been saved

17:05.041 --> 17:09.166
and should have been put in charge of God?

17:10.333 --> 17:12.625
He's saved by killing him.

17:12.875 --> 17:14.625
Because he was destroyed,

17:14.834 --> 17:19.750
because everything was destroyed, he's saved.

17:20.208 --> 17:23.500
This is to be understood in his life, Krishna's life,

17:23.709 --> 17:26.999
that this is first thing happens, so that for you people,

17:27.166 --> 17:29.500
evil is to be finished.

17:29.792 --> 17:30.875
So what you have to pray

17:31.041 --> 17:33.875
that, "O Lord, finish all the evil of the world,

17:34.083 --> 17:38.583
all the destruction of the world,

17:38.792 --> 17:42.333
all the minds which build up our destruction,

17:42.542 --> 17:45.166
please try to neutralise it."

17:45.375 --> 17:47.709
This is what a Sahaja Yogi should ask for.

17:47.917 --> 17:48.709
Instead of that,

17:48.917 --> 17:53.875
they try to sometimes identify themselves with these ideas.

17:54.083 --> 17:56.208
That's not correct . You have to stand up

17:56.458 --> 17:58.375
and you have to say that it's wrong,

17:58.625 --> 18:01.999
"We are not to destroy anyone, we are not to kill anybody,

18:02.208 --> 18:03.500
we have no right."

18:03.709 --> 18:08.250
So when Krishna told Arjuna that "You kill everyone

18:08.500 --> 18:11.000
who are related to you, who are your friends

18:11.250 --> 18:16.291
and who look like your gurus, but they're already dead."

18:16.500 --> 18:18.667
It was Shri Krishna who said,

18:18.959 --> 18:23.166
it was the incarnation of Shri Krishna said it.

18:23.417 --> 18:25.709
That doesn't that you start killing everybody,

18:25.917 --> 18:30.999
becoming Arjuna, you're not Arjuna.

18:32.041 --> 18:36.041
That is how Anand Marg, this thing organisation came up,

18:36.250 --> 18:38.291
which started killing everyone,

18:38.500 --> 18:42.542
thinking that they have a right to kill. How?

18:42.917 --> 18:44.500
You have no sense of right and wrong.

18:44.750 --> 18:48.166
How can you kill anyone or how can you save any.

18:48.375 --> 18:50.667
First of all try to save instead of killing.

18:50.917 --> 18:55.375
Supposing you are faced with a boat which is in danger,

18:55.583 --> 18:56.917
people are getting drowned

18:57.083 --> 18:59.250
and you find that you have to save the people.

18:59.500 --> 19:03.333
Will you kill the people there or you try to salvage them?

19:03.542 --> 19:05.458
There is no occasion for killing now.

19:05.667 --> 19:08.709
You don't have to worry about killing, let God do that job.

19:08.917 --> 19:11.375
What you have to do is to save people,

19:11.583 --> 19:15.667
you have to save as many as possible all the time.

19:15.917 --> 19:20.458
And those who are wrong type of people, you just forget about them.

19:20.709 --> 19:23.917
You just move them out. Take them away.

19:24.166 --> 19:25.291
Have nothing to do with them.

19:25.500 --> 19:28.667
Do what you like, but do not kill them.

19:28.917 --> 19:32.542
So that is one thing one has to understand as Sahaja Yogis,

19:32.792 --> 19:36.375
that you are not here to kill anyone, to destroy anyone,

19:36.625 --> 19:40.291
to trouble anyone or to do something that is not proper.

19:40.542 --> 19:43.875
Even there is no need to say harsh words.

19:44.208 --> 19:47.208
God is going to look after. He's so anxious today,

19:47.417 --> 19:51.667
you are on the stage and He's so anxious to help you in every way

19:51.875 --> 19:54.208
because you're doing His work. But doing His work

19:54.417 --> 19:55.125
you don't take up

19:55.333 --> 19:59.000
His sword into your hands and start killing everyone.

19:59.250 --> 20:02.166
That's a very common thing we do it, in Sahaja Yoga,

20:02.375 --> 20:04.500
I've seen people become very aggressive,

20:04.709 --> 20:06.333
they talk very aggressively.

20:06.542 --> 20:09.667
Specially the new-comers who come in, in a programme.

20:09.917 --> 20:13.750
Instead of being kind, nice, compassionate, good to them,

20:13.959 --> 20:16.458
immediately they'll say, "You're a bhoot!"

20:16.709 --> 20:19.500
Very common.

20:20.709 --> 20:25.125
You won't find me doing that anytime, do I?

20:25.583 --> 20:27.999
Then you start aggressing each other also,

20:28.166 --> 20:31.000
which is against the principle of Vishuddhi.

20:31.208 --> 20:32.125
You're not to aggress.

20:32.333 --> 20:35.083
You see, because whole thing becomes discretion.

20:35.291 --> 20:38.417
What is discretion is diplomacy.

20:38.709 --> 20:41.834
The divine diplomacy is expressed through your discretion.

20:42.041 --> 20:44.083
If you have a sense of discretion, now you know -

20:44.291 --> 20:46.000
this man is dangerous,

20:46.250 --> 20:47.625
he is troubling you,

20:47.834 --> 20:49.500
now if you have a proper sense,

20:49.709 --> 20:53.125
you will remove that person in such a way from amidst yourself

20:53.375 --> 20:58.166
that there won't be any more discussion, or destruction.

20:58.375 --> 21:03.000
But on the contrary, what you do is to challenge that person,

21:03.250 --> 21:05.999
and a big fight starts. And Sahaja Yogis can fight,

21:06.208 --> 21:10.542
I tell you sometimes I don't know what to say about their fights.

21:10.917 --> 21:12.917
So must have discretion, must understand.

21:13.083 --> 21:16.083
A situation develops, for example, a situation develops

21:16.291 --> 21:18.166
where you find somebody is telling you,

21:18.375 --> 21:21.083
"You see, this person has said this about you."

21:21.333 --> 21:23.834
Then the same person goes and tells another person,

21:24.041 --> 21:26.542
"That person has said this about you."

21:26.750 --> 21:28.458
Then you start quarelling.

21:28.667 --> 21:32.834
Instead of finding out the basic reason, instead of finding out,

21:32.999 --> 21:35.959
"Why, why this is happening,

21:36.166 --> 21:38.625
why such a situation has come between ourselves.

21:38.875 --> 21:40.417
We were friends, what has happened?"

21:40.625 --> 21:43.542
Instead of that, one starts fighting, getting angry.

21:43.750 --> 21:50.083
That's not the sign of any realised soul expression.

21:50.333 --> 21:55.083
Realised souls expressions have to be extremely discreet,

21:55.333 --> 21:57.375
delicate, beautiful.

21:57.583 --> 22:01.250
Nobody should notice

22:01.458 --> 22:07.542
that you have been in any way effective,

22:09.125 --> 22:11.458
and that's how you'll work it out.

22:11.667 --> 22:14.500
So the incarnation of Shri Krishna as we say

22:14.709 --> 22:18.250
is the incarnation of the divine diplomacy.

22:18.667 --> 22:21.125
So he plays.

22:21.333 --> 22:23.375
Give you an example how he plays.

22:23.583 --> 22:28.959
There was a rakshasa, a devil,

22:29.333 --> 22:34.417
who had a blessing from Shiva

22:34.667 --> 22:40.750
that nobody can kill him.

22:41.750 --> 22:47.542
And only a saint who has never opened his eyes all his life,

22:47.917 --> 22:51.291
if he puts his eyes on him, he will be killed.

22:51.750 --> 22:56.208
So there was a saint who had a blessing

22:56.542 --> 23:00.125
that you go into your yoga, yoga nidra,

23:00.333 --> 23:04.250
sleep in your yoga sleep,

23:04.458 --> 23:07.333
and once you open your eyes

23:07.542 --> 23:13.000
on whomsoever it will fall, such a person will die.

23:15.250 --> 23:18.500
Alright, so Shri Krishna was very clever.

23:18.792 --> 23:21.667
He was fighting this devil

23:21.875 --> 23:25.542
and this devil was about to kill Shri Krishna.

23:25.750 --> 23:29.583
And Shri Krishna knew all about this, his background.

23:29.999 --> 23:32.750
So he started running away from the field,

23:32.999 --> 23:34.999
so he's got a name called Ranchodas,

23:35.166 --> 23:37.750
the one who runs away from the battle field,

23:37.999 --> 23:40.583
is regarded as something really derogatory,

23:40.792 --> 23:44.417
because it's not something great to run away from the battle field.

23:44.667 --> 23:45.542
So he didn't mind,

23:45.750 --> 23:49.375
he ran away and then this devil started following him

23:49.583 --> 23:50.709
And he went into the cave

23:50.917 --> 23:55.041
where this great saint was sleeping in his yoga nidra.

23:55.709 --> 23:58.667
And he removed his shawl

23:58.875 --> 24:02.999
and put it slowly, delicately, on that saint

24:03.250 --> 24:04.959
and hid himself.

24:05.166 --> 24:07.208
So this rakshasa came behind him.

24:07.417 --> 24:11.083
He saw him lying down there. He thought this was Shri Krishna.

24:11.333 --> 24:14.999
He said, "Ah so now you're tired, you're lying down here.

24:15.208 --> 24:17.250
Come along now, open your eyes!"

24:17.500 --> 24:23.458
And as soon as he pulled the shawl with little strength,

24:23.709 --> 24:26.500
this fellow got up and his eyes looked at him

24:26.709 --> 24:29.750
and he just was burnt.

24:32.750 --> 24:36.542
And he did not mind getting the bad name of Ranchodas.

24:36.834 --> 24:40.125
That is the sign of diplomacy.

24:40.333 --> 24:45.542
So the whole discretion of his is plain throughout his life,

24:45.750 --> 24:48.333
the whole discretion, what he should do,

24:48.542 --> 24:50.250
what is right, what is wrong,

24:50.500 --> 24:54.041
is he doesn't have this problem.

24:54.333 --> 24:59.166
Then he had to have his powers, all of them brought on this earth.

24:59.417 --> 25:00.917
So he played a trick .

25:01.083 --> 25:06.875
He got all those powers in the form of women, young women.

25:07.417 --> 25:13.083
And he made one king - you see-

25:14.041 --> 25:21.333
drag these women into his own court for him to use them.

25:21.542 --> 25:24.041
But he could never touch them.

25:24.250 --> 25:27.083
So Shri Krishna went and defeated this man.

25:27.291 --> 25:29.208
He has to have justification also,

25:29.417 --> 25:32.000
he has to have a religious justification for doing something.

25:32.333 --> 25:34.917
So he killed this king, brought all these women

25:35.125 --> 25:40.999
and they all became his wives, so-called.

25:42.542 --> 25:44.667
All kinds of tricks he used to play.

25:44.875 --> 25:47.375
I'll tell you the Radha's trick that he played.

25:47.583 --> 25:50.834
Today I'm wearing a dress like Radha because she's Viratangana,

25:51.083 --> 25:54.000
she's the one who protects our Sushumna Nadi.

25:54.291 --> 25:58.291
She's the Mahalakshmi and she wears the sari like this to protect.

25:58.542 --> 26:01.999
She wears this way, while she leaves her left hand open

26:02.166 --> 26:06.333
because this is the Shakti of Mahakali and the right hand she closes

26:06.542 --> 26:10.667
because the right hand is the Shakti of Mahasaraswati,

26:10.917 --> 26:13.999
meaning the power of creation,

26:14.208 --> 26:16.291
because creation has been done already.

26:16.542 --> 26:19.500
She's created the earth and she's created human beings,

26:19.709 --> 26:21.542
everything is done . Now that is stopped.

26:21.750 --> 26:23.709
And in India, Brahmadeva is not worshipped

26:23.917 --> 26:27.125
except there's one temple where they worship Brahmadeva,

26:27.333 --> 26:30.333
otherwise Brahmadeva has no temple or anything.

26:30.583 --> 26:33.709
So she closes this side, she preserves it within herself

26:33.959 --> 26:35.667
and she opens her left side.

26:35.917 --> 26:37.750
And in front of her

26:37.999 --> 26:41.999
is the complete protection made for all her disciples.

26:42.208 --> 26:44.875
This is the whole big 'archal' she makes,

26:45.041 --> 26:47.333
normally the 'archal' is other side of it,

26:47.542 --> 26:51.792
where the child is kept inside, hidden in other sari.

26:51.999 --> 26:54.917
But in this one, the one that they have here

26:55.125 --> 26:57.041
is the child is kept underneath this,

26:57.291 --> 27:00.583
so the whole ascent takes place of Mahalakshmi.

27:00.792 --> 27:04.792
And that's why this is the Radha's powers is shown.

27:04.999 --> 27:07.792
So I'll tell you the last story about her

27:07.999 --> 27:14.417
which will conclude this talk about

27:14.667 --> 27:16.375
Radha and Shri Krishna.

27:16.625 --> 27:19.041
That one day,

27:19.875 --> 27:25.500
one of the wives of Shri Krishna was befooled by Narada,

27:25.750 --> 27:27.458
and Narada said, "See,

27:27.709 --> 27:30.166
Krishna doesn't love you, he only loves Radha.

27:30.375 --> 27:32.667
He's just telling you stories that he loves you,

27:32.875 --> 27:37.500
that you are his wives but he is not. He is only attached to Radha."

27:37.750 --> 27:42.417
So the rumour, you see, went into the women.

27:42.667 --> 27:46.375
All of them started feeling that, "O really, it is so."

27:46.583 --> 27:49.625
So they went and told Shri Krishna that

27:49.834 --> 27:52.750
"You don't love us, you just love Radha."

27:52.959 --> 27:54.625
He said, "Who told you?" They said, "Narada."

27:54.834 --> 27:57.917
"No, no, who told you this." They said, "Narada."

27:58.083 --> 27:59.500
He said, "Narada is just telling you lies, you see,

27:59.709 --> 28:03.417
he is just trying to make some quarrel between you and me,

28:03.625 --> 28:05.375
so don't listen to him."

28:05.583 --> 28:07.709
They said, "No, no, it's true, we can prove it."

28:07.959 --> 28:09.500
He said, "Alright. I don't know that,

28:09.709 --> 28:11.667
but just now I got terrible pain in the stomach,

28:11.875 --> 28:15.208
terrible pain, I can't get over it." So they got all worried.

28:15.417 --> 28:18.999
They said, "What's the matter, what sort of a pain it is,

28:19.208 --> 28:22.166
what can we do to overcome this pain."

28:22.375 --> 28:24.125
He said, "There's very simple thing that

28:24.333 --> 28:29.041
you'll have to give me the dust of your feet to drink.

28:29.291 --> 28:32.834
If you can take out the dust of your feet and give me to drink,

28:33.041 --> 28:34.625
then I'll be saved."

28:34.834 --> 28:38.250
So these ladies used their brains. They said that

28:38.458 --> 28:39.999
"Already he doesn't love us

28:40.208 --> 28:42.208
and then if we give him the dust of our feet

28:42.417 --> 28:46.166
we'll be committing sins and then it is going to be much worse.

28:46.375 --> 28:49.250
So what's the use of playing into his hands, he's very diplomatic,

28:49.458 --> 28:50.917
it's better to forget about it."

28:51.083 --> 28:53.417
They said, "No, no, no we don't want to do such a sinful thing,

28:53.625 --> 28:57.000
is to give you the dust of our feet, it's non-protocolish,

28:57.208 --> 29:00.208
we have nothing to do like that, you don't teach us all bad things."

29:00.417 --> 29:03.458
So they stopped it. So Narada came, he said, "Now what to do,

29:03.667 --> 29:05.959
how to get rid of your pain in the stomach."

29:06.166 --> 29:08.458
He said, "There's only way out, you go to Radha

29:08.667 --> 29:11.000
and tell her that I've got a pain in the stomach

29:11.208 --> 29:13.875
and this is the medicine." So he went to Radhaji

29:14.041 --> 29:17.083
and he said to her that,

29:17.291 --> 29:20.375
"You see, Shri Krishna is very sick, he's got pain in the stomach

29:20.583 --> 29:25.583
and what you have to do is to give the dust of your feet."

29:26.125 --> 29:28.625
She said, "Yes, why not, take it,

29:28.959 --> 29:31.667
for that pain, of course, why not?"

29:32.458 --> 29:38.083
So he said, "Aren't you worried about your punyas,

29:38.333 --> 29:40.291
aren't you worried that you're committing sin."

29:40.542 --> 29:42.625
She said, "You don't know this Shri Krishna,

29:42.875 --> 29:44.625
he has no sense of sin at all.

29:44.875 --> 29:46.917
He makes me do sin morning till evening,

29:47.125 --> 29:48.458
what am I to worry about sins.

29:48.667 --> 29:51.834
I'm not going to worry about that, you better take this for him,

29:52.000 --> 29:53.125
this is his worry."

29:53.417 --> 29:55.959
So he took the dust of Radha's feet

29:56.125 --> 29:58.458
and took it down to Shri Krishna.

29:58.709 --> 30:01.500
Shri Krishna: "Did she give you." He said, "Did she give you?"

30:01.709 --> 30:03.875
He said, "Yes, she has, I'm surprised,

30:04.083 --> 30:07.375
but she's not worried about her sins, she's not worried."

30:07.625 --> 30:10.458
He said, "That I know." So he said, "But how do you explain it?"

30:10.667 --> 30:12.375
He said, "You'll understand just now."

30:12.667 --> 30:14.959
He took the dust of Radha's feet,

30:15.166 --> 30:20.166
you see Radha's feet were dusted

30:20.375 --> 30:22.375
or were full of dust of Vrindavan,

30:22.583 --> 30:28.834
and Vrindavan has got yellow kind of clay,

30:29.000 --> 30:31.500
you see, the soil is yellowish

30:31.709 --> 30:35.875
and the whole yellow thing was on her feet

30:36.041 --> 30:38.333
which she removed and took it.

30:38.542 --> 30:43.583
So when Shri Krishna drank that dust,

30:44.041 --> 30:47.625
Narada saw in the heart of Shri Krishna,

30:47.834 --> 30:52.583
Radha was lying down and playing with her feet

30:52.834 --> 30:54.875
on the lotus of his heart.

30:55.041 --> 31:01.041
The lotus had the pollen,

31:01.542 --> 31:03.583
the pollen of the lotus was touching her feet

31:03.792 --> 31:05.458
and was making it yellow.

31:05.792 --> 31:09.166
That's what she said that "What is it when I'm in his heart,

31:09.375 --> 31:15.375
my feet are in his heart, so what is the sin I can commit?"

31:17.500 --> 31:22.000
And when the ladies heard this, they realised that

31:22.250 --> 31:25.208
their idea about Shri Krishna is still not sufficient.

31:25.458 --> 31:28.792
They have to be Radha to understand him.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.250
And this is how he plays diplomacy,

31:31.500 --> 31:34.208
simple tricks here and there by which he did it.

31:34.458 --> 31:40.083
And to introduce the beauty of Leela, he started Ras;

31:40.291 --> 31:43.500
Ra is energy, Sa means 'with'.

31:43.792 --> 31:46.917
So he made Radha dance, stand there with him,

31:47.125 --> 31:49.709
give him the the power and everybody danced.

31:49.959 --> 31:53.500
And they looked like as if Radha and Krishna dancing.

31:53.792 --> 31:57.208
And this is what he started, and then to make it, culminate it,

31:57.417 --> 32:01.458
he made a festival of Holi in which he said, "Abandon everything!

32:01.709 --> 32:03.542
For a minute you abandon everything."

32:03.792 --> 32:06.625
And that abandonment has now become a,

32:06.875 --> 32:08.750
that's for only one day you have to abandon,

32:08.959 --> 32:12.750
here it has become a year-long Holi.

32:12.999 --> 32:14.834
So people are busy with a year-long Holi

32:15.000 --> 32:16.709
without Shri Krishna and Radha.

32:16.959 --> 32:20.166
So what will be the situation of such a place?

32:20.375 --> 32:22.999
And that's why I think, what happens that

32:23.166 --> 32:27.041
when you try to attract others by all these stupid things,

32:27.291 --> 32:30.291
only the bhoots are attracted and they get into you.

32:30.542 --> 32:33.542
And once they get into you, you get funny,

32:33.750 --> 32:35.250
you don't know why you behave like this,

32:35.458 --> 32:37.834
why things work out that way.

32:38.083 --> 32:39.999
This is why we have to understand

32:40.166 --> 32:42.834
that we have to be attractive to God.

32:43.041 --> 32:47.375
And you'll be only attractive to God if you have got your spirit.

32:47.667 --> 32:51.375
If the spirit is shining, then only you can get into it.

32:51.875 --> 32:54.542
So May God Bless You.
