Shri Lalita and Shri Chakra Puja, Brahmapuri (India),
during India Tour 1990/91, 17 December 1990.

00:01:18.044 --> 00:01:28.707
The knowledge about Kundalini has been expressed
in many Sanskrit Shastras since long

00:01:31.307 --> 00:01:41.727
and also in Ayurveda it is described, not only that
but the books which are for curriculum

00:01:43.098 --> 00:01:54.187
talk about Kundalini and the chakras, because Ayurveda
is very, very close to Sahaja Yoga.

00:01:57.117 --> 00:02:06.953
Even in the western medicine to begin with, you should
see the history they took to -dealt with three doshas.

00:02:07.895 --> 00:02:17.731
They dealt with three problems that
we have as in Ayurveda.

00:02:19.553 --> 00:02:31.655
The right side which has got bita means bile; left side which has
got cuff means phlegm, and the central part,

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:39.040
the problems of vayu means the gases.

00:02:39.407 --> 00:02:45.745
Now luckily so many western people have taken to Sahaja Yoga

00:02:46.051 --> 00:02:51.200
and have tried to bring down
all the permutations and combinations to the

00:02:51.665 --> 00:02:57.030
simple reasoning of left, right and centre.

00:02:57.756 --> 00:03:07.232
But the knowledge of Sahaja Yoga is absolutely basics;

00:03:07.923 --> 00:03:15.164
even in Ayurveda is one step away
from reality,

00:03:15.871 --> 00:03:18.747
of which it says the fundamentals.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.813
So you are dealing with the fundamentals of which a human
being is built.

00:03:25.392 --> 00:03:34.191
And if this knowledge was found out long time back in
India should we not accept it?

00:03:36.003 --> 00:03:44.502
The reason why people went into meditation in those days
and found out all these deeper things within ourselves,

00:03:44.956 --> 00:03:49.048
because they didn’t have to fight the nature.

00:03:49.547 --> 00:03:53.071
You have seen here nature how beautiful it is.

00:03:54.126 --> 00:03:59.862
You can spend all your life under a tree, while in the West,

00:04:00.383 --> 00:04:03.714
even before getting out of the house you have
to take

00:04:03.885 --> 00:04:08.374
at least 15 to 20 minutes to be prepared to go out.

00:04:10.755 --> 00:04:16.401
It’s quite a struggle. So the nature has been so kind

00:04:16.605 --> 00:04:25.468
and that is the reason people took to meditation and found
out all these deeper things within themselves.

00:04:25.869 --> 00:04:32.869
When they found it out it was all written in Sanskrit language.

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.610
I have such a big thick book on this,

00:04:38.871 --> 00:04:46.263
which has described all the Shakti,
Pithas and all the Shri Chakras,

00:04:48.474 --> 00:04:52.146
Brahma chakra, lalita chakras and all that.

00:04:52.508 --> 00:04:59.508
But this was just written down,
but hardly any person got realisation.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:12.431
But in any other language like Marathi or Hindi which was
spoken and written by common people nothing was done.

00:05:13.107 --> 00:05:19.202
Nobody knew about it; only a few people who
read about it. Especially the Shaiwas,

00:05:19.551 --> 00:05:24.774
they went into the research and they went into the world.

00:05:24.985 --> 00:05:28.742
But very few people really got realisation; very, very few.

00:05:29.687 --> 00:05:36.687
Then in the 12th century, only the Nath Panthis,

00:05:37.216 --> 00:05:44.381
who were experts of Sanskrit, who were following it rigidly,

00:05:44.608 --> 00:05:48.630
that one master, should have one disciple not more than that.

00:05:48.774 --> 00:05:54.248
This was their tradition. But in the 12th century Gyanadeva,

00:05:54.441 --> 00:05:58.998
Gyaneshwara, who was another Nath Panthi,

00:05:59.403 --> 00:06:03.938
his guru was his own brother,

00:06:04.188 --> 00:06:14.178
he asked the permission from his brother that please allow me

00:06:14.526 --> 00:06:18.106
to say all these things openly.

00:06:21.338 --> 00:06:24.796
At least to say in Marathi language

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:31.144
because the common people don’t know anything about this knowledge.

00:06:31.247 --> 00:06:39.069
So he allowed him and he wrote the 6th chapter of Gyanaeshwari

00:06:39.432 --> 00:06:42.480
in which he described Kundalini.

00:06:45.337 --> 00:06:48.341
But it was in the 12th century.

00:06:48.511 --> 00:06:52.967
After that many saints described and talked about it.

00:06:53.137 --> 00:06:59.237
Where we went yesterday to Satara,
you know that’s the place where Shri Ramdasa lived.

00:07:01.478 --> 00:07:07.124
He said that Kundalini -there somebody asked him
“How much time does it take to raise the Kundalini?"

00:07:07.294 --> 00:07:10.696
-he said that Tatshan. Means that moment.

00:07:10.968 --> 00:07:16.219
But the person who wants
to take it should be deserving

00:07:16.929 --> 00:07:19.885
and the one who wants to give should be capable.

00:07:19.999 --> 00:07:26.246
It's a big condition. This is such a big if
- a capital if I tell you.

00:07:27.323 --> 00:07:32.751
As a result very, very few people got their realisation,

00:07:33.661 --> 00:07:38.362
and those who were born as realised souls found it impossible
to talk to people.

00:07:38.566 --> 00:07:42.162
Gyaneshwara, such an enlightened soul himself

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:47.171
wrote one beautiful book called “Amruta Anubhav”
which I will try to translate,

00:07:49.193 --> 00:07:53.577
which is very joy giving.
To me at least it’s very great joy giving.

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:58.250
He went so deep into the understanding of this joy.

00:07:59.262 --> 00:08:05.422
I wish English language would provide me
that subtlety to translate that book.

00:08:06.838 --> 00:08:18.684
That he wrote all these things when he was
only 23 years of age

00:08:19.639 --> 00:08:26.639
and at the age of 23 years he got so fed up that he took a living
Samadhi

00:08:27.932 --> 00:08:32.284
that is he entered into a cave and killed himself.

00:08:33.759 --> 00:08:42.242
They all tortured him very much. Nowadays this
'Andha Shraddha', stupidthing, is not tortured as much,

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:50.519
but all these saints in this country or
any country have been very much tortured,

00:08:50.882 --> 00:08:58.742
and there was no police protection. There was no one to publish

00:08:59.609 --> 00:09:02.290
about what these people are up to.

00:09:08.087 --> 00:09:18.179
Despite all that, I find there are many Sahaja
Yogis who are now occupying very big positions

00:09:18.271 --> 00:09:30.338
in the government and a day may come when everything will explode.

00:09:31.937 --> 00:09:36.482
The biggest problem of our country is something
you cannot understand

00:09:36.675 --> 00:09:39.521
because you don’t have this problem.

00:09:39.811 --> 00:09:45.949
The amount of corruption we have from A to Z for everything.

00:09:46.933 --> 00:09:53.933
That you cannot understand, I mean I have never known
any country where they have this to such an extent.

00:09:55.317 --> 00:10:00.920
Even say in Philippines, it was only one person who was doing it.

00:10:01.396 --> 00:10:11.813
Here every person has to get the money and
has to pay the money to hire Johns.

00:10:12.787 --> 00:10:19.787
For this also unless and until you get to Sahaja Yoga
it won' t work out.

00:10:20.634 --> 00:10:24.668
And Sahaja Yoga can only be worked out

00:10:25.031 --> 00:10:34.473
if people understand that it is their heritage
and that they have the capacity

00:10:35.776 --> 00:10:41.389
to understand Sahaja Yoga and capability to
spread it.

00:10:42.546 --> 00:10:45.479
In north India it is much better,

00:10:45.865 --> 00:10:49.532
although the vibrations in Maharashtra are much better;

00:10:49.666 --> 00:10:54.119
it is something funny. Vibrations in Maharashtra are very good.

00:10:54.448 --> 00:10:57.237
The people in the north India are very good Sahaja Yogis

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:01.206
and they are many, many, many in number.

00:11:02.558 --> 00:11:06.975
We can' t say, even in Bombay
we get about 12000 people for my programmes,

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:15.082
but still the way
it is spreading in North India is very surprising.

00:11:16.309 --> 00:11:18.660
Also it is spreading.

00:11:19.386 --> 00:11:28.057
This is Satara because it was blessed by Ramdasa, this district.

00:11:29.972 --> 00:11:34.033
I think everywhere there is a flower there
has to be thorns

00:11:34.285 --> 00:11:38.047
and this district has got some really very bad culprits.

00:11:39.122 --> 00:11:44.641
Ahmednagar is much better. Aurangabad we are doing much better;

00:11:45.031 --> 00:11:50.391
it will work out in Aurangabad much better.
And then if you go to the other side Berhar

00:11:51.025 --> 00:11:55.387
- from where I come is going to work out very fast.

00:11:55.487 --> 00:11:59.912
Things are moving very fast there. I
was amazed so many people have told me that

00:12:00.161 --> 00:12:04.662
in Amravati so many are Sahaja Yogis and in
Akola, so many are there. I was surprised,

00:12:04.755 --> 00:12:07.485
I have never been there.

00:12:08.426 --> 00:12:12.420
So that is how it is spreading in Maharashtra.

00:12:12.545 --> 00:12:17.073
So your song of Maharashtra Desha is working out. It’s not failing.

00:12:18.808 --> 00:12:22.152
But I think Satara is the most difficult place.

00:12:22.225 --> 00:12:27.739
Where we worked out yesterday I gave them left and right as
to what they are.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:30.698
It has helped them a lot,

00:12:30.835 --> 00:12:34.904
because those who came to opposes at down and got their realisation.

00:12:35.157 --> 00:12:42.157
So they are misleading people to start some
sort of a new culture, like you started hippism.

00:12:45.127 --> 00:12:50.716
And they are collecting young people, that
young people are leaving their schools.

00:12:50.904 --> 00:12:56.654
Some parents come and complained to me about it.
They are not paying attention to their studies,

00:12:56.949 --> 00:13:06.272
they are failing in their classes and these
people are stupidly using them.

00:13:06.972 --> 00:13:16.175
I asked some of the boys "what is your policy?" He said
“We have no policy". Then what is your aim?

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.419
“We have no aim".

00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:21.254
“Then why are you doing this nonsense? »

00:13:21.413 --> 00:13:28.013
They said because whatever the elders tell us we do it. I said
“Have you no personality? Nothing?”

00:13:28.466 --> 00:13:35.278
It’s exactly what happened when this hippy
movement started.

00:13:36.125 --> 00:13:42.284
Some so-called intellectuals started
this horrible hippy movement in the West

00:13:42.862 --> 00:13:49.038
and when they found they cannot do anything about it,
they found it’s going to fail.

00:13:49.358 --> 00:14:00.478
So many children lost their education. So many children
I know became pregnant; girls and boys started squatting.

00:14:02.805 --> 00:14:08.899
All that took them to the extreme that they
became violent.

00:14:09.625 --> 00:14:15.948
But unless and until there is a change within yourself,
how can you change anything outside?

00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:23.029
You cannot. And the first 7 people I fought, were all hippies;

00:14:24.094 --> 00:14:31.320
very difficult. They called themselves hippies
but they used to honk like a pig.

00:14:32.802 --> 00:14:39.802
They wanted all the comforts, everything free,
extremely dominating and quarrelsome people.

00:14:40.974 --> 00:14:45.441
But the foundation was laid on them. Very surprising.

00:14:45.805 --> 00:14:52.805
But I had to work on them for at least 4 years regularly.

00:15:14.561 --> 00:15:18.613
So that is how Sahaja Yoga started

00:15:19.419 --> 00:15:22.285
and today you know how much it has spread,

00:15:22.513 --> 00:15:25.307
how far it has gone.

00:15:25.455 --> 00:15:31.849
Only in Maharashtra this problem is there of so-called
intellectuals, they call themselves, but they have no intelligence.

00:15:33.107 --> 00:15:36.119
I talked to one man. I got fed up.

00:15:36.224 --> 00:15:40.065
He didn't know anything about spirituality, he didn't
know anything about medicine,

00:15:40.133 --> 00:15:42.559
he didn't know anything about science.

00:15:42.899 --> 00:15:49.189
I said “Now what
do you know?” It was impossible.

00:15:49.386 --> 00:15:53.872
So such people who are jobless, we call them
‘recanting', they have no work.

00:15:54.015 --> 00:15:59.069
They are starting all such things and we should not
be upset with them.

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:05.833
They are trying to create problems
and they are getting money from some sources.

00:16:06.442 --> 00:16:15.044
They are afraid. I think the politicians are afraid,
perhaps that Sahaja Yoga may turn their tables down,

00:16:16.098 --> 00:16:18.396
because we believe in honesty

00:16:20.104 --> 00:16:27.104
and maybe a day may come when these honest
people might harm them, perhaps. I do not know why.

00:16:27.468 --> 00:16:34.468
This may be one of the reasons why people are frightened of us.

00:16:37.346 --> 00:16:46.427
Or whatever it is we have to understand that
for doing any great work, one has to sacrifice.

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:51.229
Of course you are not going to be crucified
like Christ, no.

00:16:51.417 --> 00:16:56.403
Nor do you have to sacrifice as my parents sacrificed for
the independence of this country.

00:16:56.656 --> 00:16:59.113
Nor are you going to be tortured.

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:06.040
But little inconveniences you may have. But I must
thank you very much because of your coming here

00:17:07.378 --> 00:17:14.378
and singing Marathi songs. They are quite impressed and they
think it's only possible because you are all Sahaja Yogis

00:17:15.074 --> 00:17:25.457
otherwise you could not have done it. So if there are
any inconveniences, think that itis a joke, that's all.

00:17:29.706 --> 00:17:36.597
Today I was thinking we should do the Puja
of Shri Chakra and Lalita Chakra which we have never done.

00:17:37.153 --> 00:17:42.249
This is the right place to do these two chakras today.

00:17:47.045 --> 00:17:54.045
A lot has been written about Shri Chakra, and about Lalita
Chakra, but to understand fundamentally

00:17:55.616 --> 00:18:02.552
the left side when it reaches up to Vishuddhi,

00:18:02.729 --> 00:18:14.670
then it uses on the right side the Shri Chakra, on the left side
the Lalita Chakra, to manifest itself.

00:18:18.128 --> 00:18:27.535
These two chakras are the ones who manifest all that you see.

00:18:31.109 --> 00:18:37.909
But these chakras are the ones
who emit vibrations of different kinds

00:18:38.556 --> 00:18:50.042
and because of their angularities, like
if you have some sort of a cardboard attached

00:18:50.261 --> 00:18:55.892
with small-small holes of different colours
which rotates all the time,

00:18:56.083 --> 00:19:03.083
you get different colours,
also you can get different permutations and combinations.

00:19:03.863 --> 00:19:09.259
In the same way different permutations
and combinations are created,

00:19:10.144 --> 00:19:15.322
and that is how you get all the advantages
of Sahaja Yoga.

00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:18.157
So these two chakras are very important.

00:19:18.492 --> 00:19:24.171
I do not know if you know of any mantras about Shri Chakra

00:19:24.265 --> 00:19:32.721
but I'll give you a book. Later on I'll translate it to you
and you can compose something for Shri Chakra.

00:19:33.675 --> 00:19:37.663
Shri Chakra on the right side, Lalita Chakra on the leftside.

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:44.840
So what we are really worshipping today is
Maha Saraswati Power and Maha Kali Power

00:19:45.373 --> 00:19:50.869
both put together. So now we've started combining
things, not individually.

00:19:52.596 --> 00:19:56.436
Now these two energies are very important.

00:19:57.695 --> 00:20:04.336
Without the energy, without the power,
nothing exists, for example if this

00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:11.630
light had no power to give light or to
burn it is useless.

00:20:14.861 --> 00:20:19.893
In the same way without getting your realisation,

00:20:21.028 --> 00:20:27.453
you are useless, because your power is not awakened.
At least not completely.

00:20:27.841 --> 00:20:41.103
But these two powers, give us lots of benefits
even without realisation.

00:20:44.747 --> 00:20:52.715
Whatever you see in this world created is done by these two
chakras of the Adi Shakti.

00:20:55.070 --> 00:21:00.305
But here the power doesn't move, it's not moving.

00:21:00.782 --> 00:21:06.836
But in the human being the power starts moving,

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:18.271
and when it starts moving then we can say it is creating
another world.

00:21:20.158 --> 00:21:22.563
But movement is not the only thing.

00:21:24.717 --> 00:21:28.796
This power acts, gives you intelligence,

00:21:29.472 --> 00:21:33.966
gives you all kinds of things which you have as human beings.

00:21:35.917 --> 00:21:41.019
But later on this power itself becomes enlightened within you.

00:21:42.244 --> 00:21:47.130
In the left and right side both become enlightened.

00:21:48.779 --> 00:21:54.287
This enlightenment, you get it when you get yourself realisation,

00:21:54.936 --> 00:21:59.434
but not immediately, not immediately, this one should understand.

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:10.656
For example, if you have pain, or if your chakra is catching,
you have to use your hands.

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:17.260
You cannot say that, 'the energy is flowing within me,
it's alright, I can manage', it's not like that.

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:25.870
You have to use your hands to impart that
power to yourself or to others.

00:22:27.638 --> 00:22:31.567
If you have pain in the stomach,

00:22:31.755 --> 00:22:37.342
then you can say that if there's energy in my stomach
why should I have pain in the stomach?

00:22:38.015 --> 00:22:54.063
But the play of these chakras has to come,
and that is why you have to use your power of your hands.

00:22:56.172 --> 00:23:04.118
If you cannot use your hands then you cannot impart this energy.

00:23:04.994 --> 00:23:07.528
Many people have asked me, that Mother,

00:23:07.708 --> 00:23:17.564
when will it move horizontal? It will move horizontalno doubt,
it does,

00:23:18.779 --> 00:23:26.486
but even that horizontal movement is to be guided by
these two very important chakras.

00:23:28.857 --> 00:23:33.605
So you must understand the importance of these
two chakras within yourself.

00:23:34.357 --> 00:23:42.189
That's why I have told many a times, don't move your head
too many times, and this way many people talk, this style

00:23:42.574 --> 00:23:47.764
of talking, "no, this, that," very common with French especially.

00:23:48.866 --> 00:23:55.866
That's another way you are not respecting your chakras, shouldn't
move your shoulders too much.

00:23:57.190 --> 00:24:08.309
Mostly they talk like this, its anti-chakras, anti-chakras.
Should keep your shoulders straight.

00:24:08.684 --> 00:24:18.466
When you are singing you can move your whole upper
part, is all right, but not your shoulders.

00:24:20.207 --> 00:24:27.584
This is the thing, one has to understand,
that these two centres are to be looked after.

00:24:28.411 --> 00:24:36.178
You can move your neck, your body when you
are singing, is important, that helps,

00:24:38.152 --> 00:24:40.893
but not your shoulders.

00:24:41.171 --> 00:24:44.170
Shoulders are to be kept intact,

00:24:44.646 --> 00:24:48.046
but while saying just yes, you need not go on "yes, yes, yes, yes."

00:24:49.522 --> 00:24:54.171
Is very very simple thing,
but it can have a very bad effect,

00:24:54.362 --> 00:24:59.477
and those who move their shoulders too much do not feel
vibrations much

00:24:59.895 --> 00:25:04.518
because the chakras are not alright.

00:25:08.287 --> 00:25:14.549
It's a very simple thing to be understood
that they are the most important chakras we have

00:25:14.812 --> 00:25:20.695
and whatever is to be used out of this Paramachaitanya,

00:25:20.825 --> 00:25:25.324
they have to be used by these two centres.

00:25:26.044 --> 00:25:33.044
Even supposing your some chakra is catching on
your spinal cord, you have to use your hands.

00:25:35.287 --> 00:25:41.486
Somebody can say, "I can just put my attention."
Doesn't work out, that good.

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:50.511
Because yet your attention has not that, reached that stage
where these chakras, like Lalita Chakra and Shri Chakra

00:25:52.777 --> 00:25:58.594
obey your attention, they do not.

00:25:58.935 --> 00:26:06.106
So you have to workout with your hands, be careful, don't move
your shoulders too much.

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:12.171
And, if you see now Indians when they sing
bhajans, they move the whole body.

00:26:12.429 --> 00:26:20.590
They'll do like this, but never their shoulders. The
shoulders will move in the same way as the neck is moving.

00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:25.363
They might move their neck
also. But they'll never move their shoulder like this,

00:26:25.556 --> 00:26:30.746
and it's regarded as inauspicious according to Indian standards.

00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:38.599
Because of this culture, based on what the
saints have told,

00:26:38.731 --> 00:26:46.887
and also about many seers have told,
it is more related to spiritual life than to materialistic life.

00:26:48.798 --> 00:26:53.944
Now the materialistic life, unless and until there is
the foundation of the spiritual life,

00:26:54.164 --> 00:27:01.164
takes you to a very partial development, we can say.

00:27:01.452 --> 00:27:11.442
But to get a full development,
you must have your foundation on spirituality.

00:27:13.392 --> 00:27:18.832
That's why spirituality being
the foundation has to be deep, has to be fully

00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:23.469
equipped, has to be absolutely perfect.

00:27:23.731 --> 00:27:26.997
Then the whole building can be built.

00:27:28.122 --> 00:27:33.368
What's gone wrong in the West doesn't matter,
now you can build it up,

00:27:33.694 --> 00:27:38.963
and then, you'll be surprised how you become really solid people.

00:27:42.619 --> 00:27:49.619
This is a very short talk about Shri Chakra.
I think I should sit down and write all about it,

00:27:49.933 --> 00:27:53.357
and it will be nice handy thing for you to read.

00:27:56.182 --> 00:28:01.712
But you must know, that, beyond thought when you go,

00:28:04.328 --> 00:28:09.314
these chakras become extremely these chakras
become extremely efficient,

00:28:09.606 --> 00:28:12.920
because the thought puts a pressure on them,

00:28:14.303 --> 00:28:20.237
and because of the pressure the movement of
these chakras is very slow and ineffective.

00:28:20.969 --> 00:28:26.704
But once you can get out of your thoughts
and go into thoughtless awareness,

00:28:27.181 --> 00:28:33.405
then these chakras start working it out
and you start moving much deeper into your own being.

00:40:53.506 --> 00:41:05.842
