00:04.678 --> 00:08.826
Shri Lalita and Shri Chakra Puja, Brahmapuri (India),
during India Tour 1990/91, 17 December 1990.

01:18.044 --> 01:28.707
The knowledge about Kundalini has been expressed
in many Sanskrit Shastras since long

01:31.307 --> 01:41.727
and also in Ayurveda it is described, not only that
but the books which are for curriculum

01:43.098 --> 01:54.187
talk about Kundalini and the chakras, because Ayurveda
is very, very close to Sahaja Yoga.

01:57.117 --> 02:06.953
Even in the western medicine to begin with, you should
see the history they took to -dealt with three doshas.

02:07.895 --> 02:17.731
They dealt with three problems that
we have as in Ayurveda.

02:19.553 --> 02:31.655
The right side which has got bita means bile; left side which has
got cuff means phlegm, and the central part,

02:32.040 --> 02:39.040
the problems of vayu means the gases.

02:39.407 --> 02:45.745
Now luckily so many western people have taken to Sahaja Yoga

02:46.051 --> 02:51.200
and have tried to bring down
all the permutations and combinations to the

02:51.665 --> 02:57.030
simple reasoning of left, right and centre.

02:57.756 --> 03:07.232
But the knowledge of Sahaja Yoga is absolutely basics;

03:07.923 --> 03:15.164
even in Ayurveda is one step away
from reality,

03:15.871 --> 03:18.747
of which it says the fundamentals.

03:18.880 --> 03:23.813
So you are dealing with the fundamentals of which a human
being is built.

03:25.392 --> 03:34.191
And if this knowledge was found out long time back in
India should we not accept it?

03:36.003 --> 03:44.502
The reason why people went into meditation in those days
and found out all these deeper things within ourselves,

03:44.956 --> 03:49.048
because they didn’t have to fight the nature.

03:49.547 --> 03:53.071
You have seen here nature how beautiful it is.

03:54.126 --> 03:59.862
You can spend all your life under a tree, while in the West,

04:00.383 --> 04:03.714
even before getting out of the house you have
to take

04:03.885 --> 04:08.374
at least 15 to 20 minutes to be prepared to go out.

04:10.755 --> 04:16.401
It’s quite a struggle. So the nature has been so kind

04:16.605 --> 04:25.468
and that is the reason people took to meditation and found
out all these deeper things within themselves.

04:25.869 --> 04:32.869
When they found it out it was all written in Sanskrit language.

04:35.470 --> 04:38.610
I have such a big thick book on this,

04:38.871 --> 04:46.263
which has described all the Shakti,
Pithas and all the Shri Chakras,

04:48.474 --> 04:52.146
Brahma chakra, lalita chakras and all that.

04:52.508 --> 04:59.508
But this was just written down,
but hardly any person got realisation.

05:01.380 --> 05:12.431
But in any other language like Marathi or Hindi which was
spoken and written by common people nothing was done.

05:13.107 --> 05:19.202
Nobody knew about it; only a few people who
read about it. Especially the Shaiwas,

05:19.551 --> 05:24.774
they went into the research and they went into the world.

05:24.985 --> 05:28.742
But very few people really got realisation; very, very few.

05:29.687 --> 05:36.687
Then in the 12th century, only the Nath Panthis,

05:37.216 --> 05:44.381
who were experts of Sanskrit, who were following it rigidly,

05:44.608 --> 05:48.630
that one master, should have one disciple not more than that.

05:48.774 --> 05:54.248
This was their tradition. But in the 12th century Gyanadeva,

05:54.441 --> 05:58.998
Gyaneshwara, who was another Nath Panthi,

05:59.403 --> 06:03.938
his guru was his own brother,

06:04.188 --> 06:14.178
he asked the permission from his brother that please allow me

06:14.526 --> 06:18.106
to say all these things openly.

06:21.338 --> 06:24.796
At least to say in Marathi language

06:26.340 --> 06:31.144
because the common people don’t know anything about this knowledge.

06:31.247 --> 06:39.069
So he allowed him and he wrote the 6th chapter of Gyanaeshwari

06:39.432 --> 06:42.480
in which he described Kundalini.

06:45.337 --> 06:48.341
But it was in the 12th century.

06:48.511 --> 06:52.967
After that many saints described and talked about it.

06:53.137 --> 06:59.237
Where we went yesterday to Satara,
you know that’s the place where Shri Ramdasa lived.

07:01.478 --> 07:07.124
He said that Kundalini -there somebody asked him
“How much time does it take to raise the Kundalini?"

07:07.294 --> 07:10.696
-he said that Tatshan. Means that moment.

07:10.968 --> 07:16.219
But the person who wants
to take it should be deserving

07:16.929 --> 07:19.885
and the one who wants to give should be capable.

07:19.999 --> 07:26.246
It's a big condition. This is such a big if
- a capital if I tell you.

07:27.323 --> 07:32.751
As a result very, very few people got their realisation,

07:33.661 --> 07:38.362
and those who were born as realised souls found it impossible
to talk to people.

07:38.566 --> 07:42.162
Gyaneshwara, such an enlightened soul himself

07:42.310 --> 07:47.171
wrote one beautiful book called “Amruta Anubhav”
which I will try to translate,

07:49.193 --> 07:53.577
which is very joy giving.
To me at least it’s very great joy giving.

07:53.850 --> 07:58.250
He went so deep into the understanding of this joy.

07:59.262 --> 08:05.422
I wish English language would provide me
that subtlety to translate that book.

08:06.838 --> 08:18.684
That he wrote all these things when he was
only 23 years of age

08:19.639 --> 08:26.639
and at the age of 23 years he got so fed up that he took a living
Samadhi

08:27.932 --> 08:32.284
that is he entered into a cave and killed himself.

08:33.759 --> 08:42.242
They all tortured him very much. Nowadays this
'Andha Shraddha', stupidthing, is not tortured as much,

08:44.550 --> 08:50.519
but all these saints in this country or
any country have been very much tortured,

08:50.882 --> 08:58.742
and there was no police protection. There was no one to publish

08:59.609 --> 09:02.290
about what these people are up to.

09:08.087 --> 09:18.179
Despite all that, I find there are many Sahaja
Yogis who are now occupying very big positions

09:18.271 --> 09:30.338
in the government and a day may come when everything will explode.

09:31.937 --> 09:36.482
The biggest problem of our country is something
you cannot understand

09:36.675 --> 09:39.521
because you don’t have this problem.

09:39.811 --> 09:45.949
The amount of corruption we have from A to Z for everything.

09:46.933 --> 09:53.933
That you cannot understand, I mean I have never known
any country where they have this to such an extent.

09:55.317 --> 10:00.920
Even say in Philippines, it was only one person who was doing it.

10:01.396 --> 10:11.813
Here every person has to get the money and
has to pay the money to hire Johns.

10:12.787 --> 10:19.787
For this also unless and until you get to Sahaja Yoga
it won' t work out.

10:20.634 --> 10:24.668
And Sahaja Yoga can only be worked out

10:25.031 --> 10:34.473
if people understand that it is their heritage
and that they have the capacity

10:35.776 --> 10:41.389
to understand Sahaja Yoga and capability to
spread it.

10:42.546 --> 10:45.479
In north India it is much better,

10:45.865 --> 10:49.532
although the vibrations in Maharashtra are much better;

10:49.666 --> 10:54.119
it is something funny. Vibrations in Maharashtra are very good.

10:54.448 --> 10:57.237
The people in the north India are very good Sahaja Yogis

10:57.360 --> 11:01.206
and they are many, many, many in number.

11:02.558 --> 11:06.975
We can' t say, even in Bombay
we get about 12000 people for my programmes,

11:07.180 --> 11:15.082
but still the way
it is spreading in North India is very surprising.

11:16.309 --> 11:18.660
Also it is spreading.

11:19.386 --> 11:28.057
This is Satara because it was blessed by Ramdasa, this district.

11:29.972 --> 11:34.033
I think everywhere there is a flower there
has to be thorns

11:34.285 --> 11:38.047
and this district has got some really very bad culprits.

11:39.122 --> 11:44.641
Ahmednagar is much better. Aurangabad we are doing much better;

11:45.031 --> 11:50.391
it will work out in Aurangabad much better.
And then if you go to the other side Berhar

11:51.025 --> 11:55.387
- from where I come is going to work out very fast.

11:55.487 --> 11:59.912
Things are moving very fast there. I
was amazed so many people have told me that

12:00.161 --> 12:04.662
in Amravati so many are Sahaja Yogis and in
Akola, so many are there. I was surprised,

12:04.755 --> 12:07.485
I have never been there.

12:08.426 --> 12:12.420
So that is how it is spreading in Maharashtra.

12:12.545 --> 12:17.073
So your song of Maharashtra Desha is working out. It’s not failing.

12:18.808 --> 12:22.152
But I think Satara is the most difficult place.

12:22.225 --> 12:27.739
Where we worked out yesterday I gave them left and right as
to what they are.

12:28.680 --> 12:30.698
It has helped them a lot,

12:30.835 --> 12:34.904
because those who came to opposes at down and got their realisation.

12:35.157 --> 12:42.157
So they are misleading people to start some
sort of a new culture, like you started hippism.

12:45.127 --> 12:50.716
And they are collecting young people, that
young people are leaving their schools.

12:50.904 --> 12:56.654
Some parents come and complained to me about it.
They are not paying attention to their studies,

12:56.949 --> 13:06.272
they are failing in their classes and these
people are stupidly using them.

13:06.972 --> 13:16.175
I asked some of the boys "what is your policy?" He said
“We have no policy". Then what is your aim?

13:16.600 --> 13:18.419
“We have no aim".

13:18.950 --> 13:21.254
“Then why are you doing this nonsense? »

13:21.413 --> 13:28.013
They said because whatever the elders tell us we do it. I said
“Have you no personality? Nothing?”

13:28.466 --> 13:35.278
It’s exactly what happened when this hippy
movement started.

13:36.125 --> 13:42.284
Some so-called intellectuals started
this horrible hippy movement in the West

13:42.862 --> 13:49.038
and when they found they cannot do anything about it,
they found it’s going to fail.

13:49.358 --> 14:00.478
So many children lost their education. So many children
I know became pregnant; girls and boys started squatting.

14:02.805 --> 14:08.899
All that took them to the extreme that they
became violent.

14:09.625 --> 14:15.948
But unless and until there is a change within yourself,
how can you change anything outside?

14:16.130 --> 14:23.029
You cannot. And the first 7 people I fought, were all hippies;

14:24.094 --> 14:31.320
very difficult. They called themselves hippies
but they used to honk like a pig.

14:32.802 --> 14:39.802
They wanted all the comforts, everything free,
extremely dominating and quarrelsome people.

14:40.974 --> 14:45.441
But the foundation was laid on them. Very surprising.

14:45.805 --> 14:52.805
But I had to work on them for at least 4 years regularly.

15:14.561 --> 15:18.613
So that is how Sahaja Yoga started

15:19.419 --> 15:22.285
and today you know how much it has spread,

15:22.513 --> 15:25.307
how far it has gone.

15:25.455 --> 15:31.849
Only in Maharashtra this problem is there of so-called
intellectuals, they call themselves, but they have no intelligence.

15:33.107 --> 15:36.119
I talked to one man. I got fed up.

15:36.224 --> 15:40.065
He didn't know anything about spirituality, he didn't
know anything about medicine,

15:40.133 --> 15:42.559
he didn't know anything about science.

15:42.899 --> 15:49.189
I said “Now what
do you know?” It was impossible.

15:49.386 --> 15:53.872
So such people who are jobless, we call them
‘recanting', they have no work.

15:54.015 --> 15:59.069
They are starting all such things and we should not
be upset with them.

16:00.110 --> 16:05.833
They are trying to create problems
and they are getting money from some sources.

16:06.442 --> 16:15.044
They are afraid. I think the politicians are afraid,
perhaps that Sahaja Yoga may turn their tables down,

16:16.098 --> 16:18.396
because we believe in honesty

16:20.104 --> 16:27.104
and maybe a day may come when these honest
people might harm them, perhaps. I do not know why.

16:27.468 --> 16:34.468
This may be one of the reasons why people are frightened of us.

16:37.346 --> 16:46.427
Or whatever it is we have to understand that
for doing any great work, one has to sacrifice.

16:47.170 --> 16:51.229
Of course you are not going to be crucified
like Christ, no.

16:51.417 --> 16:56.403
Nor do you have to sacrifice as my parents sacrificed for
the independence of this country.

16:56.656 --> 16:59.113
Nor are you going to be tortured.

16:59.270 --> 17:06.040
But little inconveniences you may have. But I must
thank you very much because of your coming here

17:07.378 --> 17:14.378
and singing Marathi songs. They are quite impressed and they
think it's only possible because you are all Sahaja Yogis

17:15.074 --> 17:25.457
otherwise you could not have done it. So if there are
any inconveniences, think that itis a joke, that's all.

17:29.706 --> 17:36.597
Today I was thinking we should do the Puja
of Shri Chakra and Lalita Chakra which we have never done.

17:37.153 --> 17:42.249
This is the right place to do these two chakras today.

17:47.045 --> 17:54.045
A lot has been written about Shri Chakra, and about Lalita
Chakra, but to understand fundamentally

17:55.616 --> 18:02.552
the left side when it reaches up to Vishuddhi,

18:02.729 --> 18:14.670
then it uses on the right side the Shri Chakra, on the left side
the Lalita Chakra, to manifest itself.

18:18.128 --> 18:27.535
These two chakras are the ones who manifest all that you see.

18:31.109 --> 18:37.909
But these chakras are the ones
who emit vibrations of different kinds

18:38.556 --> 18:50.042
and because of their angularities, like
if you have some sort of a cardboard attached

18:50.261 --> 18:55.892
with small-small holes of different colours
which rotates all the time,

18:56.083 --> 19:03.083
you get different colours,
also you can get different permutations and combinations.

19:03.863 --> 19:09.259
In the same way different permutations
and combinations are created,

19:10.144 --> 19:15.322
and that is how you get all the advantages
of Sahaja Yoga.

19:15.470 --> 19:18.157
So these two chakras are very important.

19:18.492 --> 19:24.171
I do not know if you know of any mantras about Shri Chakra

19:24.265 --> 19:32.721
but I'll give you a book. Later on I'll translate it to you
and you can compose something for Shri Chakra.

19:33.675 --> 19:37.663
Shri Chakra on the right side, Lalita Chakra on the leftside.

19:37.840 --> 19:44.840
So what we are really worshipping today is
Maha Saraswati Power and Maha Kali Power

19:45.373 --> 19:50.869
both put together. So now we've started combining
things, not individually.

19:52.596 --> 19:56.436
Now these two energies are very important.

19:57.695 --> 20:04.336
Without the energy, without the power,
nothing exists, for example if this

20:04.630 --> 20:11.630
light had no power to give light or to
burn it is useless.

20:14.861 --> 20:19.893
In the same way without getting your realisation,

20:21.028 --> 20:27.453
you are useless, because your power is not awakened.
At least not completely.

20:27.841 --> 20:41.103
But these two powers, give us lots of benefits
even without realisation.

20:44.747 --> 20:52.715
Whatever you see in this world created is done by these two
chakras of the Adi Shakti.

20:55.070 --> 21:00.305
But here the power doesn't move, it's not moving.

21:00.782 --> 21:06.836
But in the human being the power starts moving,

21:08.160 --> 21:18.271
and when it starts moving then we can say it is creating
another world.

21:20.158 --> 21:22.563
But movement is not the only thing.

21:24.717 --> 21:28.796
This power acts, gives you intelligence,

21:29.472 --> 21:33.966
gives you all kinds of things which you have as human beings.

21:35.917 --> 21:41.019
But later on this power itself becomes enlightened within you.

21:42.244 --> 21:47.130
In the left and right side both become enlightened.

21:48.779 --> 21:54.287
This enlightenment, you get it when you get yourself realisation,

21:54.936 --> 21:59.434
but not immediately, not immediately, this one should understand.

22:00.250 --> 22:10.656
For example, if you have pain, or if your chakra is catching,
you have to use your hands.

22:11.970 --> 22:17.260
You cannot say that, 'the energy is flowing within me,
it's alright, I can manage', it's not like that.

22:18.870 --> 22:25.870
You have to use your hands to impart that
power to yourself or to others.

22:27.638 --> 22:31.567
If you have pain in the stomach,

22:31.755 --> 22:37.342
then you can say that if there's energy in my stomach
why should I have pain in the stomach?

22:38.015 --> 22:54.063
But the play of these chakras has to come,
and that is why you have to use your power of your hands.

22:56.172 --> 23:04.118
If you cannot use your hands then you cannot impart this energy.

23:04.994 --> 23:07.528
Many people have asked me, that Mother,

23:07.708 --> 23:17.564
when will it move horizontal? It will move horizontalno doubt,
it does,

23:18.779 --> 23:26.486
but even that horizontal movement is to be guided by
these two very important chakras.

23:28.857 --> 23:33.605
So you must understand the importance of these
two chakras within yourself.

23:34.357 --> 23:42.189
That's why I have told many a times, don't move your head
too many times, and this way many people talk, this style

23:42.574 --> 23:47.764
of talking, "no, this, that," very common with French especially.

23:48.866 --> 23:55.866
That's another way you are not respecting your chakras, shouldn't
move your shoulders too much.

23:57.190 --> 24:08.309
Mostly they talk like this, its anti-chakras, anti-chakras.
Should keep your shoulders straight.

24:08.684 --> 24:18.466
When you are singing you can move your whole upper
part, is all right, but not your shoulders.

24:20.207 --> 24:27.584
This is the thing, one has to understand,
that these two centres are to be looked after.

24:28.411 --> 24:36.178
You can move your neck, your body when you
are singing, is important, that helps,

24:38.152 --> 24:40.893
but not your shoulders.

24:41.171 --> 24:44.170
Shoulders are to be kept intact,

24:44.646 --> 24:48.046
but while saying just yes, you need not go on "yes, yes, yes, yes."

24:49.522 --> 24:54.171
Is very very simple thing,
but it can have a very bad effect,

24:54.362 --> 24:59.477
and those who move their shoulders too much do not feel
vibrations much

24:59.895 --> 25:04.518
because the chakras are not alright.

25:08.287 --> 25:14.549
It's a very simple thing to be understood
that they are the most important chakras we have

25:14.812 --> 25:20.695
and whatever is to be used out of this Paramachaitanya,

25:20.825 --> 25:25.324
they have to be used by these two centres.

25:26.044 --> 25:33.044
Even supposing your some chakra is catching on
your spinal cord, you have to use your hands.

25:35.287 --> 25:41.486
Somebody can say, "I can just put my attention."
Doesn't work out, that good.

25:42.240 --> 25:50.511
Because yet your attention has not that, reached that stage
where these chakras, like Lalita Chakra and Shri Chakra

25:52.777 --> 25:58.594
obey your attention, they do not.

25:58.935 --> 26:06.106
So you have to workout with your hands, be careful, don't move
your shoulders too much.

26:06.840 --> 26:12.171
And, if you see now Indians when they sing
bhajans, they move the whole body.

26:12.429 --> 26:20.590
They'll do like this, but never their shoulders. The
shoulders will move in the same way as the neck is moving.

26:20.930 --> 26:25.363
They might move their neck
also. But they'll never move their shoulder like this,

26:25.556 --> 26:30.746
and it's regarded as inauspicious according to Indian standards.

26:32.650 --> 26:38.599
Because of this culture, based on what the
saints have told,

26:38.731 --> 26:46.887
and also about many seers have told,
it is more related to spiritual life than to materialistic life.

26:48.798 --> 26:53.944
Now the materialistic life, unless and until there is
the foundation of the spiritual life,

26:54.164 --> 27:01.164
takes you to a very partial development, we can say.

27:01.452 --> 27:11.442
But to get a full development,
you must have your foundation on spirituality.

27:13.392 --> 27:18.832
That's why spirituality being
the foundation has to be deep, has to be fully

27:19.270 --> 27:23.469
equipped, has to be absolutely perfect.

27:23.731 --> 27:26.997
Then the whole building can be built.

27:28.122 --> 27:33.368
What's gone wrong in the West doesn't matter,
now you can build it up,

27:33.694 --> 27:38.963
and then, you'll be surprised how you become really solid people.

27:42.619 --> 27:49.619
This is a very short talk about Shri Chakra.
I think I should sit down and write all about it,

27:49.933 --> 27:53.357
and it will be nice handy thing for you to read.

27:56.182 --> 28:01.712
But you must know, that, beyond thought when you go,

28:04.328 --> 28:09.314
these chakras become extremely these chakras
become extremely efficient,

28:09.606 --> 28:12.920
because the thought puts a pressure on them,

28:14.303 --> 28:20.237
and because of the pressure the movement of
these chakras is very slow and ineffective.

28:20.969 --> 28:26.704
But once you can get out of your thoughts
and go into thoughtless awareness,

28:27.181 --> 28:33.405
then these chakras start working it out
and you start moving much deeper into your own being.
