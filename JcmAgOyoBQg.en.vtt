00:00:25.917 --> 00:00:28.625
[Prashan] is crying, [isn't Michelle]?

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:30.709
Better take him out, I think.

00:00:30.917 --> 00:00:34.166
Better take him out because in meditation he'll disturb.

00:00:38.083 --> 00:00:41.125
Is he not all right?

00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:00.583
No questions?

00:01:00.834 --> 00:01:03.917
How important is color in our lives?

00:01:04.083 --> 00:01:07.792
How? Y: How important is color in our lives?

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:10.625
Color?

00:01:10.834 --> 00:01:14.208
It is important,

00:01:14.417 --> 00:01:18.333
if you understand the value in vibrations.

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:23.667
See the color, any color that you use,

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:27.999
use with other colors, gives a coefficience, you see.

00:01:28.917 --> 00:01:31.709
A painting say, for example,

00:01:31.917 --> 00:01:35.333
every painting is valued

00:01:35.542 --> 00:01:39.792
according to something artificial in normal human life.

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:44.583
I don’t know how they value it. But in the spiritual life

00:01:44.792 --> 00:01:46.999
we value it with the vibratory point of view.

00:01:47.166 --> 00:01:49.750
For example you see a painting,

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:52.792
maybe abstract, maybe any kind of a painting

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:55.875
and you put your hands towards the painting.

00:01:56.041 --> 00:01:58.458
If the person who has painted it, is a realized soul...

00:01:58.667 --> 00:02:01.208
For example I would say Michelangelo.

00:02:01.417 --> 00:02:05.291
He was a realized soul. And he has done the Sistine Chapel.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.166
If you see the Christ he has made,

00:02:07.375 --> 00:02:10.917
is absolutely very near of what Christ was.

00:02:11.083 --> 00:02:13.542
But other people, you see, they make Christ in such a horrible way

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.333
that bad vibrations are coming.

00:02:15.542 --> 00:02:17.500
And I mean I don’t know how people like it

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.208
but some people say : "Oh, it's very great and it's very valuable".

00:02:21.417 --> 00:02:24.875
I just don't understand, who is nowhere near Christ,

00:02:25.041 --> 00:02:29.417
it is not good colors and it's the inside, the filth inside,

00:02:29.625 --> 00:02:31.250
you see, people are trying to express.

00:02:31.458 --> 00:02:34.709
For example to show Christ, like, just like a skeleton, you know.

00:02:34.917 --> 00:02:36.041
It's a cynicism, I think.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.583
How can a person who carried a complete cross be like that?

00:02:39.792 --> 00:02:41.917
You can imagine, you see. He was a healthy man.

00:02:42.083 --> 00:02:45.291
Not healthy, He could take five of modern people

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.375
and just swirl them in the air, you see.

00:02:48.583 --> 00:02:50.458
He was such a powerful personality!

00:02:50.667 --> 00:02:52.917
And such a man can only be non violent.

00:02:53.083 --> 00:02:55.041
And His non violence has a glory, isn't it?

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.000
What is the non violence of a person who is already a weakling?

00:02:59.208 --> 00:03:01.417
So they show Christ, such a weakling, I can't believe it.

00:03:01.625 --> 00:03:04.333
and I just don't understand from where did they get the ideas.

00:03:04.542 --> 00:03:07.792
But I've seen such statues being sold for a very big price.

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:10.500
So human beings have their own ways of value system.

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.250
But the Divine has different. So the color also plays, say,

00:03:14.458 --> 00:03:18.792
you may have colors, like red color is now,

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:21.208
people according to the psychologists

00:03:21.417 --> 00:03:23.083
who are quite stupid, I must say,

00:03:23.291 --> 00:03:27.542
is very bad, according to them the red color is.

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.583
No, but it is not. Red is the color of the Mother.

00:03:30.792 --> 00:03:35.959
Because the first light in a mother's womb is red.

00:03:36.125 --> 00:03:37.792
The child sees the red.

00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:42.291
And that's why it has the smallest, what you call, the wavelength.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.291
Anything that you want to attract the attention, you see,

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.250
a cricket ball is red. If you want to say "Danger", it is red.

00:03:51.458 --> 00:03:56.750
And the red color has its own value. The white has its own value.

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.250
But in human mind it's very different.

00:04:00.458 --> 00:04:02.333
You see, they have their own norms, and forms

00:04:02.542 --> 00:04:04.583
and things like you see, they have got.

00:04:04.792 --> 00:04:06.999
Now you must eat with, say, fork and knives.

00:04:07.166 --> 00:04:08.875
Now the fork and knife must be kept like this.

00:04:09.041 --> 00:04:11.583
If you don't keep like that, then you are not elite,

00:04:11.792 --> 00:04:14.792
you see, like that. So in the same way, in, even in art

00:04:14.999 --> 00:04:17.917
they have done this kind of a mischief, that this color is nice,

00:04:18.083 --> 00:04:20.417
that color is nice, you must have everything pastel.

00:04:20.625 --> 00:04:23.500
Now they are changing, because first they used to say:

00:04:23.709 --> 00:04:26.542
"All right, we can have blue". This must be an old one.

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.999
So they say: "All right, let's have blue more, some sort of a..."

00:04:29.208 --> 00:04:31.583
Specially the Grey color, you see, Grey.

00:04:31.792 --> 00:04:33.417
Now the whole sky is Grey, everything is Grey,

00:04:33.625 --> 00:04:35.375
why do you want to have Grey on your body

00:04:35.583 --> 00:04:38.500
also [go in] Grey suits, isn't it, used to have?

00:04:38.709 --> 00:04:42.375
But now they have realized there's no warmth in Grey, in blue color.

00:04:42.583 --> 00:04:44.875
So must have something warm. So they want to put red.

00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:46.792
They are realizing gradually, you see.

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:50.333
It's all right Grey for Indians who are so full of exuberance

00:04:50.542 --> 00:04:52.834
to give them a little balance, let them wear some Grey,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.583
it's all right. But for people who are in England

00:04:55.792 --> 00:04:57.583
I think Grey is too much. I mean it's a headache

00:04:57.792 --> 00:05:01.125
to see anymore greys and when you see the yards and yards of greys

00:05:01.333 --> 00:05:05.291
walking in these smarties I see, I'm really shocked.

00:05:05.875 --> 00:05:09.250
And specially you have those dresses from,

00:05:09.458 --> 00:05:11.999
borrowed dresses, that you wear, you see.

00:05:12.166 --> 00:05:15.250
Some look so odd and so clumsy in those dresses

00:05:15.458 --> 00:05:16.834
and they are walking about, you see, they think

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.625
there is no end of themselves.

00:05:18.834 --> 00:05:20.250
They look really clownish, you see.

00:05:20.458 --> 00:05:23.959
But these forms and these things we have created, human beings,

00:05:24.125 --> 00:05:26.041
That, "this is the form which is the best.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.291
You must wear a tail coat". All right, tail coat looks nice,

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.417
but not in Grey, by any chance, I can tell you,

00:05:32.625 --> 00:05:34.709
If you wear a Grey early in the morning, it's not,

00:05:34.917 --> 00:05:38.208
I think its rather not being nice to God,

00:05:38.417 --> 00:05:42.709
because how are to show Grey on a nice sunny morning?

00:05:42.917 --> 00:05:46.166
You should wear something nice, red. Y: Thank you.

00:05:46.375 --> 00:05:49.583
All right? So it is very diverse and beautiful.

00:05:49.792 --> 00:05:52.500
But one must enter into the realm of the Spirit.

00:05:52.709 --> 00:05:55.417
Then everything forms, you see, just like magnet,

00:05:55.625 --> 00:05:56.917
when you put the magnet through,

00:05:57.083 --> 00:05:59.667
all filings go into proper direction,

00:05:59.875 --> 00:06:01.959
in the same way the whole thing becomes so

00:06:02.125 --> 00:06:03.458
systematic and understanding.

00:06:03.667 --> 00:06:05.959
Immediately you know which place is giving vibrations,

00:06:06.125 --> 00:06:07.667
which is not giving vibrations.

00:06:07.875 --> 00:06:11.166
Even the chair you can make out, everything you can make out.

00:06:11.375 --> 00:06:14.417
It's very interesting. Even the forms.

00:06:14.625 --> 00:06:16.792
The other day only I told you about Mona Lisa, if you,

00:06:16.999 --> 00:06:19.208
I mean according to the modern ideas of beauty,

00:06:19.417 --> 00:06:22.083
where you have just mosquito-like women, you see, walking,

00:06:22.291 --> 00:06:25.125
the Mona Lisa seems to be an ugly woman.

00:06:25.333 --> 00:06:27.875
But still people are attracted towards her. Why?

00:06:28.041 --> 00:06:30.208
Because there's this coefficience which gives vibrations.

00:06:30.458 --> 00:06:33.458
She gives vibrations, you know.

00:06:33.999 --> 00:06:38.166
So only on that vibratory awareness only one can judge,

00:06:38.375 --> 00:06:39.999
whether it is absolute or not.

00:06:40.166 --> 00:06:42.125
Because you have not reached your absolute point.

00:06:42.333 --> 00:06:44.667
To somebody it may be a good painting,

00:06:44.875 --> 00:06:48.834
to somebody it must be horrifying.

00:06:49.125 --> 00:06:52.792
Yes?  Y: Mother [yesterday] when You were talking about that

00:06:52.999 --> 00:06:57.500
eighty years old woman who was riding a horse [unclear],

00:06:57.792 --> 00:06:59.625
it seems to me that we all do it sometimes,

00:06:59.834 --> 00:07:04.875
why do You laugh at others people's sufferings and [unclear].

00:07:05.041 --> 00:07:08.500
SM: Suffering?  Y:Sometimes I do laugh unconscious [unclear].

00:07:08.709 --> 00:07:10.750
What is it? Why do we have sufferings, you are saying?

00:07:10.959 --> 00:07:14.792
No, I'm saying I am upset You laughed when You talked

00:07:14.999 --> 00:07:16.999
about that eighty years old woman riding a horse.

00:07:17.208 --> 00:07:21.999
And why did You laugh then, and why do You [unclear].

00:07:22.166 --> 00:07:25.125
You come here, I can't hear you, just come here.

00:07:25.333 --> 00:07:26.792
You are saying something nice definitely

00:07:26.999 --> 00:07:29.375
but what is it, I don't know.

00:07:29.583 --> 00:07:31.959
Mother, I was saying You laughed

00:07:32.125 --> 00:07:35.375
when you talked about that eighty year old woman riding a horse.

00:07:35.583 --> 00:07:38.417
And it seemed to me that, I [unclear] rationalizing

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:43.792
that it was [in her hurry] falling then to the death. Right?

00:07:43.999 --> 00:07:49.250
And being as a not at all [unclear] soul I am,

00:07:49.999 --> 00:07:54.375
I was wondering why we, I laughed, and that's at suffering

00:07:54.583 --> 00:07:58.709
and also why You did as well?

00:07:59.999 --> 00:08:02.625
Still I didn't follow.

00:08:02.834 --> 00:08:08.583
Come here, come here. What's the matter? You know I can't hear.

00:08:08.792 --> 00:08:10.750
You talked about a woman riding a horse, right?

00:08:10.959 --> 00:08:13.333
SM: About what? Y: That eighty old woman riding a horse.

00:08:13.542 --> 00:08:16.417
Aha! Oh, I see, oh, I see. Yeah.

00:08:16.625 --> 00:08:18.166
But You laughed and I was wondering why and why,

00:08:18.375 --> 00:08:22.000
why we laughed as well? [unclear]

00:08:22.417 --> 00:08:24.250
Because it is nonsense

00:08:24.458 --> 00:08:27.542
for an eighty year old woman to sit on a horse.

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:30.792
See, you're not supposed to sit. You see, ask any wise man,

00:08:30.999 --> 00:08:35.542
say from India get a villager, he will just laugh, you know,

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:39.125
that he wouldn't understand why an eighty year old woman, you see,

00:08:39.333 --> 00:08:43.709
poor that horse, how far can it look after that old woman?

00:08:43.917 --> 00:08:46.083
Why do you trouble the horse like that?

00:08:46.291 --> 00:08:49.417
See, an old woman should know

00:08:49.625 --> 00:08:53.542
that it's a liability on a horse.

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:59.333
And she should not jump onto a horse, isn't it? It's simple as that.

00:08:59.542 --> 00:09:03.125
You see, an old woman should behave as she is old,

00:09:03.333 --> 00:09:04.999
she should accept her old age.

00:09:05.208 --> 00:09:07.500
It's a very great thing to be old, you know.

00:09:07.709 --> 00:09:12.583
And it's such a glorious time you have as an old woman.

00:09:12.792 --> 00:09:15.208
I mean , I enjoy my old age the best of all.

00:09:15.417 --> 00:09:17.458
And I think it's a great thing to be old.

00:09:17.667 --> 00:09:22.542
But to behave like a child of, say, fifteen years,

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:25.834
and getting on a horse when you are eighty years, it's wrong.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
That means there's no sense of proportion.

00:09:28.208 --> 00:09:31.458
One must mature with time, see, the maturity must come.

00:09:31.667 --> 00:09:35.458
Like my grandchildren would like

00:09:35.667 --> 00:09:39.709
to play with the little cars, all right?

00:09:39.917 --> 00:09:42.625
Then my husband would like to play with his own car,

00:09:42.834 --> 00:09:46.041
which is a moving car. Maybe I am maybe,

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:50.125
sort of little bit too oldish and over mature.

00:09:50.333 --> 00:09:51.999
May not like to play with these things,

00:09:52.166 --> 00:09:55.792
I may like to play with your Kundalini.

00:09:58.208 --> 00:10:01.750
So, it's stupid for an eighty year old woman

00:10:01.959 --> 00:10:04.458
to get on top of a horse. It's absolutely stupid.

00:10:04.667 --> 00:10:08.667
And it's stupid for a little child to get on top of the horse.

00:10:08.875 --> 00:10:11.917
See, everything should be done according to the age.

00:10:12.083 --> 00:10:15.583
It's only why she got onto the horse? What? Why? What is the need?

00:10:15.792 --> 00:10:20.291
Only because her ego is there, simple thing as ego.

00:10:21.083 --> 00:10:24.291
She doesn't want to accept her age.

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:29.208
She doesn't want to settle down as a mature old lady.

00:10:29.417 --> 00:10:30.583
It's nice to be very old.

00:10:30.792 --> 00:10:32.917
She doesn't understand how nice is to be old.

00:10:33.083 --> 00:10:35.500
In this country only, I don't know why people ridicule,

00:10:35.709 --> 00:10:39.583
but all your leaders are very old, surprising.

00:10:39.792 --> 00:10:44.000
I mean Margaret Thatcher is slightly older than Me.

00:10:45.542 --> 00:10:47.959
All your leaders are old and why do you ridicule the old age,

00:10:48.125 --> 00:10:52.750
I don't understand.  Unless and until you are old,

00:10:52.959 --> 00:10:56.417
you are not going to be accepted as leaders even in this country.

00:10:56.709 --> 00:10:59.417
British are that way quite wise.

00:10:59.625 --> 00:11:02.709
I think only William Blake was the man who was very young.

00:11:02.917 --> 00:11:04.709
And is something so remarkable.

00:11:04.917 --> 00:11:08.208
I mean old age is very much respected in a way.

00:11:08.417 --> 00:11:10.041
And you must respect your old age,

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:13.041
not to behave like a little boy of fifteen years,

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:14.834
to get on top of a horse, you see.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.834
And this horse must be nervous, I'm sure,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.625
because horse understands who rides.

00:11:23.375 --> 00:11:24.583
All right?

00:11:24.792 --> 00:11:28.125
What I was trying to tell that how people become stupid

00:11:28.333 --> 00:11:29.959
and they don't understand they have been stupid,

00:11:30.125 --> 00:11:33.667
because it's just ego.

00:11:33.875 --> 00:11:36.083
I: But why do You laugh at ego? SM: I beg your pardon?

00:11:36.291 --> 00:11:38.333
Excuse me, Mother. Why do you laugh at ego?

00:11:38.542 --> 00:11:41.792
Laugh at ego? On stupidity, what do you do?

00:11:41.999 --> 00:11:43.709
I mean, you can only laugh at.

00:11:43.917 --> 00:11:47.083
At people who are stupid we can only laugh, isn't it?

00:11:47.291 --> 00:11:50.917
What else can we do? They are stupid, startlingly stupid.

00:11:51.083 --> 00:11:54.375
Because, you see, this woman could have taken to Sahaja Yoga,

00:11:54.583 --> 00:11:57.417
she could have got cured, she could have been all right,

00:11:57.625 --> 00:11:58.625
she could have helped people.

00:11:58.834 --> 00:12:01.417
Instead of that she's spending her time in going on a horse.

00:12:01.625 --> 00:12:04.709
Now, she's done it, that, long time back. Why she's doing even now?

00:12:04.917 --> 00:12:07.917
Why doesn't she think? That there are very a few years left for her,

00:12:08.083 --> 00:12:10.166
it is important, these are very important years.

00:12:10.375 --> 00:12:13.999
Let her do something sensible.

00:12:15.875 --> 00:12:19.625
There's no sense in this. Only thing you can do is to laugh.

00:12:19.834 --> 00:12:21.291
There's no sense. What is the sense

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:25.083
in going about on a horse like that?

00:12:25.458 --> 00:12:28.500
It's a possession of the ego, I think.

00:12:28.709 --> 00:12:32.750
Horse is, a horse or motorcar and all these things,

00:12:32.959 --> 00:12:34.208
are things of ego.

00:12:34.417 --> 00:12:37.667
I know of a lady in India, her husband was a governor,

00:12:37.875 --> 00:12:39.875
and I used to think she was a sensible woman.

00:12:40.041 --> 00:12:44.542
But as soon as he retired from governorship, she died.

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:47.917
She came down from the horse.

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.542
But isn't it good to laugh, isn't it good?

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:55.792
If one looks after mental patients,

00:12:55.999 --> 00:12:58.709
and all these crazy little things they do,

00:12:58.917 --> 00:13:02.959
we couldn't look after, if we didn't laugh but crying.

00:13:03.125 --> 00:13:06.750
Yes, I understand. You see, we have to laugh at many things.

00:13:06.959 --> 00:13:11.291
It's a joke, you know, all the time, the whole,

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:15.041
whole thing is a drama in which you see something stupid

00:13:15.291 --> 00:13:20.333
then you laugh, you see something funny going on, you laugh.

00:13:20.542 --> 00:13:23.875
It's better to laugh than to be angry.

00:13:24.041 --> 00:13:26.250
Better to laugh than to be angry, isn't it?

00:13:26.458 --> 00:13:31.417
What's the use of getting angry with a woman who's already dead?

00:13:33.291 --> 00:13:38.083
There's no wisdom. No wisdom in this kind of living, you see.

00:13:38.291 --> 00:13:41.625
That's what I was trying to say that a person with his ego

00:13:41.834 --> 00:13:45.375
loses his wisdom.

00:13:45.917 --> 00:13:47.417
There is no wisdom.

00:13:47.625 --> 00:13:49.917
Human life is very precious, not to be wasted.

00:13:50.083 --> 00:13:52.834
I mean, if this woman had lived, I knew her very well,

00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:56.750
that's why I am saying, she would have done something good.

00:13:56.959 --> 00:14:01.959
Her life would have had some meaning, but she was not bothered.

00:14:02.709 --> 00:14:04.375
So You laugh [when You see pity things].

00:14:04.583 --> 00:14:06.792
SM: I beg your pardon. I: You laugh [when you see pity things].

00:14:06.999 --> 00:14:09.875
You see, I laugh because what I am to do now?

00:14:10.041 --> 00:14:12.542
I mean, what to do, I mean I felt very sorry,

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:15.000
her husband is left all alone now in life,

00:14:15.208 --> 00:14:18.959
he doesn't know what to do and I don't know what to do.

00:14:19.125 --> 00:14:20.625
Because the husband is a very nice man,

00:14:20.834 --> 00:14:23.458
is a very big man in the country.

00:14:23.667 --> 00:14:27.999
He is regarded as a lord or something and he is a minister also -

00:14:28.166 --> 00:14:31.125
I don't know he is now minister or not - I know them very well.

00:14:31.333 --> 00:14:33.959
And the poor fellow is now,

00:14:34.125 --> 00:14:36.458
doesn't know how to manage his household, anything,

00:14:36.667 --> 00:14:38.458
he is left high and dry for nothing at all.

00:14:38.667 --> 00:14:40.500
And if you ask the gentleman he said,

00:14:40.709 --> 00:14:44.834
"I don't know why my wife was so crazy up to the horses."

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:49.917
You cannot expect these things, but then you just laugh.

00:14:50.333 --> 00:14:54.291
It's better to laugh than to be serious, isn't it?

00:14:54.875 --> 00:14:57.792
Only if somebody dies in your family then it's all right,

00:14:57.999 --> 00:15:01.583
but otherwise all the time we, what we find people very seriously

00:15:01.792 --> 00:15:05.917
moving about and doing what? What have we done?

00:15:06.083 --> 00:15:08.250
What have we done with all our seriousness?

00:15:08.458 --> 00:15:13.333
Created these all of the atomic bombs for our destruction?

00:15:13.542 --> 00:15:17.583
What have we achieved with all of this seriousness?

00:15:22.875 --> 00:15:25.667
We must laugh and one, one must laugh

00:15:25.875 --> 00:15:31.709
and really enjoy the play of Divine.

00:15:31.917 --> 00:15:34.333
It's beautiful.

00:15:34.542 --> 00:15:39.041
When you'll open out more, you'll laugh much more.

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:50.208
Any other question?

00:15:50.417 --> 00:15:55.291
The sages of India, here everyone always told us

00:15:55.500 --> 00:16:01.375
that when we meditate and do pranayama the spine must be straight.

00:16:02.542 --> 00:16:04.625
Why is that? Will the Kundalini not rise,

00:16:04.834 --> 00:16:08.999
if the spine is not absolutely straight?

00:16:10.999 --> 00:16:16.625
You see, these methods were employed at the time,

00:16:16.999 --> 00:16:19.417
very long time back.

00:16:19.625 --> 00:16:23.792
Patanjali shastra yoga was practiced strong long, long time back

00:16:23.999 --> 00:16:27.667
when we had a very different type of living, you see.

00:16:27.875 --> 00:16:32.333
Like four types of varnashramas we had.

00:16:32.542 --> 00:16:37.792
The first one was where a person had to be completely celibate

00:16:37.999 --> 00:16:41.999
and go to the gurus, stay in the forest,

00:16:42.208 --> 00:16:46.667
have the education with the gurus till the age of 25 years, you see.

00:16:46.875 --> 00:16:50.208
That was the age when they selected some people

00:16:50.417 --> 00:16:53.458
for Self Realization, but very few people.

00:16:53.667 --> 00:16:56.709
And then they talked to them about eight things

00:16:56.917 --> 00:16:58.959
called as ashtanga yoga,

00:16:59.125 --> 00:17:04.542
in which one of them was called as yama and nyama,

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:07.875
which meant the correction of the body,

00:17:08.041 --> 00:17:11.709
correction of the morality, correction of the behavior, everything.

00:17:11.917 --> 00:17:14.667
Yama - nyama. Nyama means the laws.

00:17:14.875 --> 00:17:19.375
Now, in that because the children when they are small,

00:17:19.583 --> 00:17:21.917
if they bend their spine too much,

00:17:22.083 --> 00:17:25.083
they will develop in any case problems, in any case.

00:17:25.291 --> 00:17:28.458
So they said you must keep your spine straight.

00:17:28.667 --> 00:17:32.458
But this prana, that they told, was done

00:17:32.667 --> 00:17:37.166
after the establishment of Spirit, you'll be amazed.

00:17:37.375 --> 00:17:39.792
Ishwara pranidhana it was called as.

00:17:39.999 --> 00:17:43.500
It was called as the establishment of the Spirit.

00:17:43.709 --> 00:17:46.208
Once the establishment of the Spirit is done,

00:17:46.417 --> 00:17:48.458
then the Kundalini starts moving,

00:17:48.667 --> 00:17:51.041
then you know what is the center is catching.

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:55.583
According to the center you have to do a particular exercise.

00:17:55.792 --> 00:17:57.417
But the modern one is very different.

00:17:57.625 --> 00:17:58.999
I mean, that has nothing to do with it.

00:17:59.166 --> 00:18:01.667
It's just they've taken out only that part

00:18:01.875 --> 00:18:03.125
where you have to do exercise.

00:18:03.375 --> 00:18:07.375
And it's really maddening when I see that, that this exercise,

00:18:07.583 --> 00:18:11.625
is something like taking all the medicine together,

00:18:11.834 --> 00:18:15.417
without understanding when you have to take, which exercise,

00:18:15.625 --> 00:18:17.709
for which part and what is the need.

00:18:17.917 --> 00:18:22.208
Because unless and until the Kundalini is moving, how will you know?

00:18:22.417 --> 00:18:23.792
So the whole thing is upside down.

00:18:23.999 --> 00:18:26.583
It could be something like without starting the car,

00:18:26.792 --> 00:18:30.667
you start moving your wheels and everything.

00:18:30.875 --> 00:18:33.208
So what people are doing today

00:18:33.417 --> 00:18:36.500
is absolutely opposite what they should have done.

00:18:36.709 --> 00:18:40.667
See, in the other way, I can say in another words

00:18:40.875 --> 00:18:43.792
can be that it is all artificial,

00:18:43.999 --> 00:18:45.792
because the Kundalini has not moved.

00:18:45.999 --> 00:18:47.250
First the Kundalini has to move,

00:18:47.458 --> 00:18:49.458
first the Ishwara pranidhana had to be done.

00:18:49.667 --> 00:18:53.375
And this is the problem today of these,

00:18:53.583 --> 00:18:55.709
with the people who have done hatha yoga.

00:18:55.917 --> 00:19:01.041
Because I find their heart

00:19:01.709 --> 00:19:04.333
has a problem.

00:19:04.542 --> 00:19:07.083
Though they are seekers, they are doing it for seeking, no doubt.

00:19:07.291 --> 00:19:12.625
But the problem is, it is a very, very partial thing they are doing.

00:19:17.125 --> 00:19:19.959
So the sages did say that your spine should be straight,

00:19:20.125 --> 00:19:22.625
our spine should be straight, no doubt.

00:19:22.834 --> 00:19:28.041
At least when we are growing, our spine is growing,

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:29.709
that time it should be straight,

00:19:29.917 --> 00:19:33.291
because if it is not straight then you develop a sort of a bend,

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:35.083
and it’s not good. But the Kundalini will rise,

00:19:35.291 --> 00:19:38.917
whether you are bent or not, believe Me, it will.

00:19:39.083 --> 00:19:41.542
Whatever style of thing you are, or the pose you are,

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:44.709
you'll get the Kundalini rise. That's all.

00:19:44.917 --> 00:19:48.792
This is something special, I should say, it's being there!

00:19:48.999 --> 00:19:50.959
It's already predicted like that.

00:19:51.125 --> 00:19:54.417
I wonder if these people have the article which Gavin has prepared.

00:19:54.625 --> 00:19:57.834
After going through certain old books of Brigumuni

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.750
who has written about two three thousand years back

00:20:01.959 --> 00:20:04.999
about this special type of thing that will take place

00:20:05.208 --> 00:20:10.083
at such and such time and they have said in 1970 this should happen

00:20:10.291 --> 00:20:13.999
and I have started this work in 1970.

00:20:14.166 --> 00:20:17.458
Something special.

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:29.166
What else?

00:20:29.458 --> 00:20:34.083
Indirectly Your Holiness You stressed on the Divine power

00:20:34.291 --> 00:20:38.834
and as a Christian I would like to know,

00:20:39.041 --> 00:20:41.542
this creation of God

00:20:41.792 --> 00:20:45.625
and according to Christian philosophy where it says we are,

00:20:45.834 --> 00:20:50.208
I would go for our Christ philosophy and He says,

00:20:50.417 --> 00:20:52.500
the way you should enrich your Spirit,

00:20:52.709 --> 00:20:56.834
is by denying the flesh completely, including the sex.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.709
So is it the same thing You are teaching?

00:20:58.917 --> 00:21:01.417
Of course, hundred per cent.

00:21:01.625 --> 00:21:05.041
I am teaching, doing what Christ has already predicted about Me.

00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:08.166
That means You are denying all Your five senses including the flesh?

00:21:08.375 --> 00:21:10.083
What? Denying what?

00:21:10.291 --> 00:21:14.125
Your five senses, your desires.

00:21:14.333 --> 00:21:16.333
No, no, I didn't say that. I didn't say that.

00:21:16.542 --> 00:21:18.792
Then how do You explain "denying the flesh"?

00:21:18.999 --> 00:21:23.333
No, No. I didn't deny anything. No, no, nothing of denying.

00:21:23.542 --> 00:21:26.250
What Christ has said, "You are to be born again".

00:21:26.458 --> 00:21:28.917
Now, the philosophy is "God, save us".

00:21:29.083 --> 00:21:30.625
because what they have made out of Christ

00:21:30.834 --> 00:21:32.542
is something I can't understand.

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:37.458
Because they are not seeing that they are not becoming the Spirit.

00:21:37.667 --> 00:21:42.500
Are they? They are not! Are they doing it?

00:21:42.709 --> 00:21:44.458
The philosophy is a different point all together.

00:21:44.667 --> 00:21:46.458
You can make anything out of your philosophy.

00:21:46.667 --> 00:21:48.959
But what Christ has precisely said

00:21:49.125 --> 00:21:52.166
is that you have to become the Spirit.

00:21:52.375 --> 00:21:57.333
He said that your hands will speak. What about that?

00:21:57.542 --> 00:22:01.750
Your hands will speak after this, you see. What Christ has said

00:22:01.959 --> 00:22:05.542
is going to happen, not what these people are telling you.

00:22:05.792 --> 00:22:10.166
What have they achieved? Say, your forefather might be a Christian,

00:22:10.417 --> 00:22:11.999
his fore... or they may be all Christians.

00:22:12.208 --> 00:22:13.583
What have they achieved? Nothing!

00:22:13.792 --> 00:22:18.500
Today the churches are selling in this country. Why?

00:22:18.709 --> 00:22:21.250
Because they have not been able to give the answer.

00:22:21.458 --> 00:22:24.125
I am here to give the answer. I am here to prove Christ.

00:22:24.333 --> 00:22:29.083
I am here to prove all that is written in the Bible.

00:22:29.542 --> 00:22:34.166
When, also is said, "the Comforter is going to come

00:22:34.375 --> 00:22:36.208
and you are going to achieve it

00:22:36.417 --> 00:22:40.041
by which you will know My Father forever".

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:43.458
What is that?

00:22:43.792 --> 00:22:46.750
They, they are not going to recognize Me, these philosophy people,

00:22:46.959 --> 00:22:49.834
they are not, they will deny. He said:

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.500
"You'll be calling Me Christ, Christ and I won't recognize you.''

00:22:52.709 --> 00:22:55.959
These are the people.

00:22:56.999 --> 00:23:01.583
These are nothing but money-making propositions.

00:23:04.709 --> 00:23:07.333
Simple as that.

00:23:07.542 --> 00:23:09.750
It was wrote that Christ has been saying this,

00:23:09.959 --> 00:23:11.999
"You, you want to follow Me, you deny yourself,

00:23:12.166 --> 00:23:13.583
then you come and follow Me".

00:23:13.834 --> 00:23:16.375
SM: What is it? Y:You'll deny yourself.

00:23:16.583 --> 00:23:18.500
No, I never said that, what are you listening?

00:23:18.709 --> 00:23:22.166
See, impossible, Christ says.

00:23:22.542 --> 00:23:23.792
What is it, denying yourself?

00:23:23.999 --> 00:23:25.542
Yes. You want to follow Me you deny yourself

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:27.999
and take up the cross and follow Me.

00:23:28.208 --> 00:23:30.041
Is it the same thing like, You try to [unclear]?

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:32.709
What, what is he saying? Again, what did Christ say?

00:23:32.917 --> 00:23:36.542
Just come here, just come here.

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:39.792
He said Christ has said you should deny your flesh. - You are what?

00:23:39.999 --> 00:23:43.250
Christ said you should deny your flesh, take up the cross and...

00:23:43.458 --> 00:23:47.625
Yes, yes, yes, yes, the flesh. Yes, yes, that's what it is, yes.

00:23:47.834 --> 00:23:49.999
I would like to know, is it the same thing You are teaching?

00:23:50.166 --> 00:23:54.333
Of course, all that, My child, it is what He taught

00:23:54.542 --> 00:23:56.875
and what He promised. He helped me.

00:23:57.041 --> 00:24:00.041
Please let me know how, how do you just deny yourself?

00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:04.458
You do not deny, actually what happens, you become the Spirit.

00:24:04.667 --> 00:24:06.125
See, when you become the Spirit,

00:24:06.333 --> 00:24:10.625
you start seeing your body, your flesh outside.

00:24:11.291 --> 00:24:13.875
Y: Yes, I understand. SM: All right? You see, you are in the water,

00:24:14.041 --> 00:24:16.250
then you are afraid of the water, you are in the water,

00:24:16.458 --> 00:24:20.375
but if you are taken in the boat, can you not see the water?

00:24:20.583 --> 00:24:23.333
But you are away from it.

00:24:23.542 --> 00:24:26.500
That's all. It happens. It's a happening.

00:24:26.709 --> 00:24:29.458
It's a happening again. All right?

00:24:29.667 --> 00:24:32.458
What Christ taught that's what I am exactly doing.

00:24:32.667 --> 00:24:36.625
But not these churches, take it from Me.

00:24:38.583 --> 00:24:40.542
I'm sorry to say this to you.

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:42.709
In a way it's self denying.

00:24:42.959 --> 00:24:44.834
It's not self denying, it's a happening.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.542
I: It's a happening. SM: You become a Spirit,

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:52.583
and you start seeing yourself as a third person. All right?

00:24:52.792 --> 00:24:55.333
It's a new thing that happens in your awareness

00:24:55.542 --> 00:24:59.250
where you become, see yourself as a third person.

00:24:59.458 --> 00:25:01.959
You just do not do it rationally, "I deny myself".

00:25:02.125 --> 00:25:05.125
All that you do not do. It happens to your awareness

00:25:05.333 --> 00:25:09.750
by which you can start seeing yourself away from yourself.

00:25:09.959 --> 00:25:13.083
Then this body, all these things are not so important.

00:25:13.291 --> 00:25:16.083
What is important is the spiritual joy.

00:25:16.291 --> 00:25:19.375
That should happen, that's the real baptism.

00:25:19.583 --> 00:25:22.959
Actually you feel that coming up here and breaking it through,

00:25:23.125 --> 00:25:25.500
the actual baptism takes place.

00:25:25.709 --> 00:25:28.667
You see the whole force coming up and pulsating here

00:25:28.875 --> 00:25:31.333
and breaking this part, is the actual baptism.

00:25:31.542 --> 00:25:34.500
It's not like somebody just putting you a hand there, artificially,

00:25:34.709 --> 00:25:38.583
"Now, you are baptized." It's not like that.

00:25:38.792 --> 00:25:43.083
It's an actual thing that should happen, that's a real actual thing.

00:25:43.417 --> 00:25:45.208
All right? May God bless you!

00:25:45.417 --> 00:25:49.709
As it is said the cold breeze, cold wind of the Holy Spirit,

00:25:49.917 --> 00:25:51.709
you really feel the cold wind of the Holy Spirit

00:25:51.917 --> 00:25:55.000
coming out of your head. You really feel it.

00:25:55.208 --> 00:25:58.583
All right? All this it had to be proved.

00:25:58.792 --> 00:26:01.250
Yes. Do You believe in Redemption, as said?

00:26:01.458 --> 00:26:03.250
Of course. This is due to Redemption only.

00:26:03.458 --> 00:26:06.458
Due to Redemption. That's all right.

00:26:08.875 --> 00:26:11.000
But for that you don't have to confess anything to Me,

00:26:11.208 --> 00:26:14.458
nothing is to be confessed, nothing, it's just happens, all right?

00:26:14.667 --> 00:26:17.834
He's such a [unclear].

00:26:18.041 --> 00:26:21.083
May God bless you!

00:26:25.291 --> 00:26:29.417
I tell you, if you really read Bible in a honest way,

00:26:29.625 --> 00:26:33.166
you'll understand Sahaja Yoga very well.

00:26:33.417 --> 00:26:37.291
You must re-read it after Realization.

00:26:37.709 --> 00:26:41.625
You'll be amazed how many truths have been covered

00:26:41.834 --> 00:26:45.667
by this so called philosophy.

00:26:47.542 --> 00:26:51.500
It's really very sad what they have done to Christ!

00:26:51.709 --> 00:26:56.625
I sometimes feel it is the second crucifixion of Christ!

00:27:00.792 --> 00:27:03.333
Funny things like Pope coming here,

00:27:03.542 --> 00:27:06.583
the protestants are saying, "We are fundamentally different".

00:27:06.792 --> 00:27:08.291
I mean how can they be Christians?

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:10.999
I mean their Christ is their fundamental or not?

00:27:11.166 --> 00:27:13.333
How can Christ be two different things?

00:27:13.542 --> 00:27:15.875
I, to My mind, I just don't understand these people

00:27:16.041 --> 00:27:19.083
following like this.

00:27:19.999 --> 00:27:25.999
Why it is happening? Because they don't believe in their own Self,

00:27:26.583 --> 00:27:30.250
nor in Christ, in reality.

00:27:30.458 --> 00:27:34.792
They believe in creating dogmas, differences, hatred, all this.

00:27:34.999 --> 00:27:37.959
How can you do it in the name of God? How can you?

00:27:38.125 --> 00:27:41.542
It's done in every of religion, no doubt.

00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:45.083
It's not only the Christians who are experts, everyone has done it.

00:27:45.291 --> 00:27:49.750
Jews are another sect. We have Jews here, we have Christians here,

00:27:49.959 --> 00:27:51.959
we have Hindus and Muslims.

00:27:52.125 --> 00:27:54.999
See, then they after Realization, see, they see,

00:27:55.166 --> 00:27:59.166
what harm have been done in the name of God.

00:27:59.375 --> 00:28:02.208
These fundamentalists, these fanatics, all of them thinking

00:28:02.417 --> 00:28:04.875
they are the chosen ones.

00:28:05.041 --> 00:28:09.375
It's very nice self-certificate this, that you are the chosen ones.
