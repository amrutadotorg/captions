00:00:06.528 --> 00:00:13.564
Today, we have gathered here to do
Ganesha Puja.

00:00:15.395 --> 00:00:20.122
I know very well that Ganesha is the symbol

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.316
of purity, of sanctity,

00:00:25.997 --> 00:00:36.191
and worshipping the innocence.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.683
When you are worshipping Shri Ganesh,
you have to know

00:00:42.884 --> 00:00:48.376
that He is the embodiment of innocence.

00:00:49.102 --> 00:00:55.544
I wonder if we understand the meaning
of innocence or not.

00:00:56.134 --> 00:01:02.293
Innocence is a quality, which is innate,

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:07.960
which cannot be forced, which cannot
be trained into.

00:01:08.161 --> 00:01:15.729
It’s just a quality, innate quality,
within a human being.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:23.842
When he becomes Shri Ganesha’s disciple,
he becomes an innocent person.

00:01:24.043 --> 00:01:28.187
Maybe you say that innocent persons

00:01:28.388 --> 00:01:33.724
are attacked by the cunning,
by the aggressive.

00:01:34.387 --> 00:01:40.285
But innocence is such a great thing
that it cannot be destroyed.

00:01:40.486 --> 00:01:46.350
Is the quality of the Spirit. Innocence is
the quality of the Spirit.

00:01:46.602 --> 00:01:55.022
And when this Spirit within you is
awakened, you get the power of innocence,

00:01:55.223 --> 00:02:02.288
by which you overcome all that is negative,
all that is wrong,

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:11.087
all that is detrimental to your growth,
spiritual understanding.

00:02:11.837 --> 00:02:16.369
So to be innocent is not possible.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:24.197
You have to be innocent, in the sense
that you are innately innocent.

00:02:24.398 --> 00:02:30.313
This happens after Sahaja Yoga,
after Realization.

00:02:31.211 --> 00:02:37.550
And your power to fight all these

00:02:37.751 --> 00:02:43.105
wrong, negative feelings within you,
and without,

00:02:43.306 --> 00:02:53.190
are absolutely supported, protected
by the Mother of Shri Ganesh.

00:02:58.317 --> 00:03:04.444
It’s difficult these days to tell somebody
about innocence.

00:03:04.645 --> 00:03:12.203
But you know the life of Christ.
He was a innocent - innocence.

00:03:12.404 --> 00:03:16.931
He didn’t know what sort of people
He was around.

00:03:17.132 --> 00:03:23.813
He thought they were all innocent. And so
He was talking to them in a manner

00:03:24.461 --> 00:03:34.331
that nobody who was cunning would
have done that.

00:03:34.532 --> 00:03:38.163
Because cunning always understand
the cunning of others.

00:03:38.364 --> 00:03:45.740
And He said things which may not have
been understood by people;

00:03:45.941 --> 00:03:52.446
but whatever He said had the vibrations
of innocence.

00:03:52.945 --> 00:03:58.996
That should have put all these people
in a proper sense,

00:03:59.197 --> 00:04:02.255
in a proper relationship with Him.

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.494
But somehow, that was not the time
perhaps for them

00:04:06.695 --> 00:04:08.942
to be realized souls.

00:04:09.903 --> 00:04:17.143
So the innocence of Ganesha was not,
that we should we say, defeated,

00:04:17.344 --> 00:04:26.585
but was very much - created an atmosphere
of such sanctity

00:04:26.786 --> 00:04:31.135
and beauty that you can see in the life
of Christ.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.046
I’m happy you all have heard about
your marriages.

00:04:38.247 --> 00:04:44.229
Why the marriage? What is the need
to have a marriage?

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.643
After all, these days people are living
without marriage.

00:04:48.844 --> 00:04:53.117
But marriage means the sanctity
of marriage.

00:04:53.677 --> 00:05:02.104
Sanctity of your physical, mental
and emotional integration.

00:05:02.305 --> 00:05:07.831
If you do not have the sanctity and you
live with a person,

00:05:08.032 --> 00:05:15.120
then it is not perfect. The children you
will produce will not be all right.

00:05:15.321 --> 00:05:17.882
That’s why the marriage is necessary.

00:05:18.083 --> 00:05:23.792
And as you know, Christ went to attend
a wedding.

00:05:23.993 --> 00:05:27.561
Why did He pay so much attention
to a wedding?

00:05:27.762 --> 00:05:33.112
Because that sanctifies your relationships
with each other.

00:05:33.313 --> 00:05:38.317
Anything is all right, but relationship

00:05:38.518 --> 00:05:42.085
between husband and wife have
to be sanctified.

00:05:42.286 --> 00:05:48.046
Otherwise, the children you produce
could turn out to be anything.

00:05:48.247 --> 00:05:56.565
They may be robbers, they may be cheats,
they may be liars,

00:05:56.766 --> 00:06:03.003
they may be very, very cruel people,
if there’s no sanctity about the marriage.

00:06:03.204 --> 00:06:07.374
That’s why He went to sanctify the marriage
institution.

00:06:07.575 --> 00:06:13.194
But is absolutely wrong and nonsense
that He created alcohol.

00:06:13.395 --> 00:06:23.198
What He did was to change the water
into the taste of grape juice.

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:27.511
“Alcohol” is called as “grape juice”
in Hebrew language.

00:06:27.712 --> 00:06:35.792
You can say it is not called, but “wine”
means alcohol

00:06:35.993 --> 00:06:40.518
as well as grape juice. But it cannot be,

00:06:40.719 --> 00:06:45.581
because instantly you cannot create
alcohol.

00:06:45.782 --> 00:06:49.874
Alcohol takes time, it has to rot
and rot and rot.

00:06:50.075 --> 00:06:57.268
Then it becomes an alcohol. But if Christ
has made it

00:06:57.469 --> 00:07:05.065
in such a sahaj manner, spontaneously,
how can it be an alcohol that intoxicates?

00:07:05.266 --> 00:07:08.499
So, many people, specially in Christian
religion,

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:14.968
believe that Christ sanctified wine,
which is absolutely wrong.

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:19.311
He never sanctified alcohol. He changed

00:07:19.512 --> 00:07:28.206
the grape juice into wine tasting.

00:07:28.407 --> 00:07:31.968
The other day, I happened to meet person,

00:07:32.169 --> 00:07:35.016
as you know him, Romano Battaglia.

00:07:35.368 --> 00:07:39.483
And he said: “Mother, You give me
Realization”.

00:07:39.684 --> 00:07:42.925
I said: “Alright, get me some water.”

00:07:43.126 --> 00:07:47.659
Brought some water, I put my fingers
into it.

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:52.425
And then he tasted and said: “Mother,
it tastes like wine!” I said: “That’s it!

00:07:52.626 --> 00:07:58.519
That’s what Christ has done.” So,
there is no sanctity of alcohol.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:03.574
How can you expect Christ to do
something like that,

00:08:03.775 --> 00:08:08.083
by which your awareness absolutely
goes wrong.

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:12.624
Those people who drink, you know,
are not normal people.

00:08:12.825 --> 00:08:16.816
Something goes wrong with their brains.
When they drive, they create problems.

00:08:17.017 --> 00:08:25.234
When they are talking to somebody,
you can make out that they are not normal.

00:08:25.435 --> 00:08:27.675
They try to be very aggressive,

00:08:27.876 --> 00:08:32.757
sometimes they can be very passive also.
Mostly they are very aggressive,

00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:39.199
and very much behaving in a manner
that doesn’t behove a human being.

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:44.183
So, we must understand that

00:08:44.384 --> 00:08:48.503
this wine, so-called, which is being
fermented for days together,

00:08:48.704 --> 00:08:53.759
is very wrong and against the spiritual
life.

00:08:54.911 --> 00:09:04.109
All those countries where alcohol
is accepted as a very sanctified thing,

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:08.136
are just going to dogs.

00:09:08.337 --> 00:09:12.574
It is against Shri Ganesh. It’s against
innocence.

00:09:12.775 --> 00:09:18.081
And so, such a person can become
very cunning, very shrewd,

00:09:18.282 --> 00:09:22.909
very dominating – all kinds of bad things
can come through him.

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:28.550
And one cannot trust a person who drinks
and becomes a drunkard.

00:09:28.751 --> 00:09:33.874
He can get after his wife, his children,
anybody.

00:09:34.075 --> 00:09:40.174
And try to destroy their lives, because
he knows he is himself destroyed.

00:09:40.735 --> 00:09:46.261
So the one thing one has to understand,
innocence doesn’t allow you

00:09:46.462 --> 00:09:51.152
to have anything like that, that goes
against your awareness.

00:09:51.353 --> 00:09:56.624
Your human awareness is very important.
That must be respected.

00:09:56.825 --> 00:10:01.593
Anything that you take that spoils
your awareness or spoils your health

00:10:01.794 --> 00:10:06.367
is all wrong for - specially for sahaj
yogis.

00:10:06.568 --> 00:10:11.499
You have to keep your health all right.
How do you keep your health all right?

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:18.232
By avoiding all such things – those which
destroy your health.

00:10:18.607 --> 00:10:22.089
So the married life is a sanctified life.

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:26.722
Is a life which is been blessed.

00:10:26.923 --> 00:10:32.152
Now we have peace, but I would say
in Sahaja Yoga, they are all blessed by Me.

00:10:32.353 --> 00:10:38.589
So one should understand that this is
a very big thing that you have got.

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:43.425
But there are many I have known, who come
round saying: “Mother, we want a divorce.

00:10:43.626 --> 00:10:47.437
We are trying to make up a good marriage…”

00:10:47.638 --> 00:10:50.646
All kinds of stories they tell Me.

00:10:51.028 --> 00:10:54.320
If you know it’s a sanctified marriage –

00:10:54.547 --> 00:11:04.894
is a marriage which is been done under
all the ceremonies of Sahaja Yoga –

00:11:05.095 --> 00:11:12.070
it cannot be a bad marriage. But if you
are bad, nobody can help you.

00:11:12.271 --> 00:11:17.726
If you have funny ideas about marriages,
you should try to correct it.

00:11:17.927 --> 00:11:21.370
If you want to marry in Sahaja Yoga,
then please see

00:11:21.571 --> 00:11:26.527
that you respect the sanctity of married
life.

00:11:26.728 --> 00:11:29.999
I know, sometimes women can be bad,

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:33.269
men can be bad, there can be problems.

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:38.081
But a person who is wise will try
to endure all that.

00:11:38.282 --> 00:11:46.085
Because she wants or he wants to respect
the sanctity of marriage.

00:11:48.556 --> 00:11:53.812
This one is a very contradictory thing
then, which comes to,

00:11:54.013 --> 00:11:57.720
that Christ was born without the marriage.

00:11:57.921 --> 00:12:02.053
And Ganesha was also born without
the marriage.

00:12:02.564 --> 00:12:06.210
They Themselves are sanctity.

00:12:06.411 --> 00:12:09.574
They don’t need any sanctity from outside.

00:12:09.775 --> 00:12:13.273
They are innocence, and for innocent
people,

00:12:13.474 --> 00:12:21.183
They don’t need any kind of a ritual
or a kind of a ceremony.

00:12:21.384 --> 00:12:27.316
That’s how They have been born,
absolutely pure, of innocence.

00:12:27.517 --> 00:12:32.472
But that doesn’t mean that we should
take Their example into ourselves.

00:12:32.673 --> 00:12:36.882
They were divine personalities, and They
were to be born like that.

00:12:37.083 --> 00:12:42.985
While we have to be sanctified and leading
a sanctified life.

00:12:43.201 --> 00:12:48.564
This is a difference between an incarnation
and a human being.

00:12:49.049 --> 00:12:56.362
Is easy to criticise incarnations.
Very simple to criticise Them.

00:12:56.563 --> 00:13:00.362
All incarnations have been criticised
by human beings,

00:13:00.563 --> 00:13:03.534
because human beings cannot understand
Them.

00:13:03.735 --> 00:13:09.624
But try to be really very pure and
innocent,

00:13:09.825 --> 00:13:14.796
and then you will understand that why
Their lives were on a different line,

00:13:14.997 --> 00:13:17.479
different style.

00:13:21.278 --> 00:13:26.701
Now, if you say: “We can develop
innocence, Mother”, you cannot.

00:13:27.332 --> 00:13:31.905
Which is the way to become innocent?
In Sahaja Yoga,

00:13:32.106 --> 00:13:38.835
we have a proper method how we can
become innocent.

00:13:39.036 --> 00:13:45.866
It happens through our thoughtless
awareness.

00:13:46.067 --> 00:13:50.011
If you are in the state of thoughtless
awareness,

00:13:50.222 --> 00:13:53.444
then what happens, you do not react.

00:13:53.645 --> 00:13:58.845
You do not get involved into wrong things.

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:05.190
You do not get involved into any
discussions, arguments. But you just watch.

00:14:05.391 --> 00:14:08.397
And the innocence within you rises
beautifully,

00:14:08.598 --> 00:14:13.416
like a lotus rises out of a dirty pond.

00:14:13.708 --> 00:14:16.190
So, whatever may be the circumstances,

00:14:16.391 --> 00:14:21.038
when you are in thoughtless awareness,
you do not react.

00:14:21.239 --> 00:14:27.808
That is the sign of innocence. And people
who do not react keep young.

00:14:28.009 --> 00:14:31.140
They will never show their age,
they keep young.

00:14:31.341 --> 00:14:40.925
Because to react is not a very good thing,

00:14:41.126 --> 00:14:45.753
which makes you get involved into
another person.

00:14:45.954 --> 00:14:51.479
But if you don’t react, if you are just
watching, and you are a witness,

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:55.753
then you don’t get involved into anything.
You are away from everything.

00:14:55.954 --> 00:15:02.673
And that’s how your innocence grows
and you get very confident.

00:15:03.438 --> 00:15:09.790
I’ve read a story about a Chinese king,
who went

00:15:10.773 --> 00:15:19.585
to a saint, and asked Him that he wants
some boon from Him. He said, “What?”

00:15:19.786 --> 00:15:25.925
He said: “I want my son to be developed
into a person

00:15:26.126 --> 00:15:28.976
who can face all kinds of people.

00:15:29.177 --> 00:15:32.925
Whatever people may do, he should
be able to face them”.

00:15:33.126 --> 00:15:36.645
He said: “Alright, you leave your son
with me”.

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:41.663
So, when the arguments started,
when the fighting started,

00:15:41.864 --> 00:15:43.675
his son was just standing straight,

00:15:43.876 --> 00:15:46.733
watching everything in thoughtless
awareness.

00:15:46.934 --> 00:15:54.358
So, everybody from the arena went back,
they all went away.

00:15:54.559 --> 00:16:02.209
And they couldn’t stand the innocence
of this boy, who was very young.

00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:06.252
And the king was surprised how his son
could face

00:16:06.453 --> 00:16:10.397
all of them, all their arguments,
all their aggression

00:16:10.598 --> 00:16:14.811
and all kinds of horrible things
they said to him.

00:16:15.012 --> 00:16:20.889
If anybody says anything to you, you should
just be innocent.

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:24.901
At that time, your power of innocence
will show

00:16:25.102 --> 00:16:29.705
that this person, who is trying
to dominate you,

00:16:29.906 --> 00:16:34.240
to trouble you, is very much in the wrong.

00:16:34.441 --> 00:16:39.834
And the person himself might realise that:
“I’m doing all these things

00:16:40.035 --> 00:16:45.140
and this fellow, the one on whom I’m trying
to dominate,

00:16:45.341 --> 00:16:47.658
is not taking any note of it.”

00:16:47.859 --> 00:16:52.238
So he feels very weak.

00:16:52.439 --> 00:16:55.699
He thinks he has no power to dominate
a person.

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:59.070
So this is we have now as sahaj yogis:

00:16:59.271 --> 00:17:01.933
we can get into thoughtless awareness.

00:17:02.134 --> 00:17:06.140
Try to reduce your reactions, reaction
to anything.

00:17:06.341 --> 00:17:11.453
People have such funny ideas about
themselves that they react.

00:17:11.654 --> 00:17:16.047
Now for example, somebody showed me
those carpets,

00:17:16.248 --> 00:17:20.121
I’ve started watching, I was very happy.
And they told me

00:17:20.322 --> 00:17:25.394
all the sahaja yoginis have made these
with their hands, so beautifully.

00:17:25.595 --> 00:17:30.461
I mean, it was really so joyful to know
that they have done it.

00:17:30.662 --> 00:17:37.355
But if I was a very normal person, I would
have said: “Oh, My God,

00:17:37.556 --> 00:17:41.285
what a colour! What a thing!” and all
that ... like that.

00:17:41.486 --> 00:17:45.218
So whatever they have done, I can’t even
enjoy that.

00:17:45.419 --> 00:17:51.203
One thing is the enjoyment is lost.
For a child, enjoyment is complete.

00:17:51.404 --> 00:17:56.929
Whatever he sees, he makes a joy,
joyful thing out of it.

00:17:57.130 --> 00:18:00.808
You look at children - I’ve seen children,

00:18:01.009 --> 00:18:03.793
they find anything, they make a toy
out of it.

00:18:03.994 --> 00:18:10.324
The other day, we had gone to Genoa and
I saw there were big blockets kept there.

00:18:10.525 --> 00:18:13.422
Some children came from somewhere.
They just climbed on that

00:18:13.623 --> 00:18:16.629
and made horses out of them. And were
enjoying them.

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:19.273
You see, they find anything, any space,

00:18:19.474 --> 00:18:24.648
they make a joyful thing for them to,
a play for them.

00:18:24.849 --> 00:18:33.082
For them, life is also a play.
Just a thing of enjoyment.

00:18:33.283 --> 00:18:35.937
And they make you also enjoy everything.

00:18:36.138 --> 00:18:41.211
If you are not in a good mood, they’ll
come and behave in such a manner

00:18:41.412 --> 00:18:51.070
that you’ll have to come round and become
a very simple, natural person.

00:18:51.271 --> 00:18:54.277
So to see, a simple natural person,
we always say:

00:18:54.478 --> 00:18:59.164
“See, they are like children”. Means they
do not understand the cunning.

00:18:59.365 --> 00:19:03.820
They do not understand the stupidity
of the people,

00:19:03.989 --> 00:19:07.082
and they live in their own world
of innocence.

00:19:07.283 --> 00:19:13.961
In the same way, all the Sahaja Yogis
have to develop that aura around them.

00:19:14.162 --> 00:19:19.250
Let people see you, how innocent you are,
how sweet you are!

00:19:19.451 --> 00:19:24.578
No arguments, no quarrelling, no fighting
is needed.

00:19:24.779 --> 00:19:31.086
It is just the inner satisfaction
of thoughtless awareness.

00:19:31.287 --> 00:19:33.898
Many people say: “Mother, we cannot
become thoughtless!”

00:19:34.099 --> 00:19:36.472
Why? Why can’t you become thoughtless?

00:19:36.673 --> 00:19:41.386
Because all the time, whatever you see,
you want to react.

00:19:41.587 --> 00:19:44.914
If you gradually start stopping reaction -

00:19:45.115 --> 00:19:48.215
introspect yourself, see for yourself.

00:19:48.416 --> 00:19:57.806
If you are all the time trying to react,
tell your mind to behave itself.

00:19:58.728 --> 00:20:02.972
If there’s any reaction, you just don’t say
anything. Keep quiet.

00:20:03.173 --> 00:20:07.121
Gradually, you’ll be amazed and surprised

00:20:07.322 --> 00:20:14.769
how you become thoughtlessly aware,
how beautiful you become.

00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:19.152
And everybody who sees you will know that

00:20:19.353 --> 00:20:23.500
you are something different – you are not
like the normal person.

00:20:23.701 --> 00:20:27.805
But the normal reaction of human beings is
this, that, if there’s a quarrel going on,

00:20:28.006 --> 00:20:34.344
say, on the street, everybody will join in
the quarrel. They like to fight.

00:20:34.545 --> 00:20:41.532
They want to be part and parcel of that
quarrel or fight or whatever it is.

00:20:41.733 --> 00:20:43.965
They don’t want to get out of it.

00:20:44.166 --> 00:20:49.285
At that time, if you just have your
innocence, that will act.

00:20:49.486 --> 00:20:53.093
I told you, innocence is the Spirit,
and Spirit is the innocence,

00:20:53.294 --> 00:20:58.562
which cannot be destroyed by anything.
The fact is that it cannot be destroyed

00:20:58.763 --> 00:21:05.385
by anything, and it can be re-established
through Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:05.586 --> 00:21:08.424
You might have been a very aggressive
person,

00:21:08.625 --> 00:21:11.168
you might have been a very unhappy person,

00:21:11.369 --> 00:21:16.215
you might have been a person who is
all the time disturbing others – maybe.

00:21:16.416 --> 00:21:21.390
But after Sahaja Yoga, you can make
your personality so sweet and beautiful,

00:21:21.591 --> 00:21:26.430
that not only you can enjoy, but others
can also enjoy.

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:36.665
This innocence is something which is
absolute, honest intelligence.

00:21:37.654 --> 00:21:47.410
It is not that it works for the purpose,
some purpose.

00:21:47.611 --> 00:21:52.621
But it is purposeless. It’s absolutely
purposeless.

00:21:52.822 --> 00:22:01.132
And thus it achieves that height of joy
because there is no purpose in anything

00:22:01.333 --> 00:22:06.069
It sees the futility of all kinds
of endeavours that we have,

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:11.144
and it just enjoys: “Why people are running
up and down, why are they fighting?”

00:22:11.347 --> 00:22:16.066
Just stands up and sees, that: “Why
should they do it?” – like that.

00:22:16.267 --> 00:22:18.183
Some may think they are all right,

00:22:18.384 --> 00:22:21.664
there’s nothing wrong with them,
but it’s not so.

00:22:21.865 --> 00:22:26.296
Innocence is something, I told you,
is an innate quality,

00:22:26.497 --> 00:22:32.208
and you should not deceive yourself
by thinking you are innocent.

00:22:32.443 --> 00:22:37.081
On the contrary, you just put some
introspection upon yourself,

00:22:37.282 --> 00:22:40.751
and see for yourself what have you been
doing so far,

00:22:40.952 --> 00:22:46.246
as far as others are concerned?
What is your attitude?

00:22:46.447 --> 00:22:50.093
I have already talked to you about
emotional intelligence.

00:22:50.294 --> 00:22:54.902
Emotional intelligence is the expression
of innocence.

00:22:55.103 --> 00:22:59.621
It is the expression of Shri Ganesha
within you.

00:22:59.822 --> 00:23:05.347
Children who are gifted with this will
always try to please you.

00:23:05.548 --> 00:23:08.585
They know what you want, what you need.

00:23:08.786 --> 00:23:12.011
They’ll give you all the joy that you want,

00:23:12.212 --> 00:23:15.757
they’ll do all the things that you like,
just to please you.

00:23:15.958 --> 00:23:20.789
They don’t have their own wants. They don’t
want to have their own demands.

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:25.160
They never say: “I want this”,
“You do for me” – never!

00:23:25.361 --> 00:23:29.730
They just want to see what you want,
what do you want to have.

00:23:29.931 --> 00:23:36.042
And they put all the effort to supply you
with that, whatever you want.

00:23:36.243 --> 00:23:39.289
It’s very interesting how the children
behave

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:47.636
towards others, elders. Just like, I would
say, a great understanding, we should say,

00:23:47.837 --> 00:23:51.968
like a very elderly personality.

00:23:52.169 --> 00:23:56.250
So, in innocence, you become extremely
grown up, matured.

00:23:56.451 --> 00:23:59.519
Very matured. With that maturity you know

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:04.410
what this person needs, and what
the other person should not have.

00:24:04.611 --> 00:24:07.500
And the way they establish is very
interesting.

00:24:07.701 --> 00:24:11.722
Children are the most interesting things,
I think, in the world.

00:24:11.923 --> 00:24:17.824
For me, roses are very beautiful, but
children are the most interesting things.

00:24:18.025 --> 00:24:24.304
And they teach you so many things that
you are surprised at their innocence.

00:24:24.505 --> 00:24:29.242
So many jokes are there about the children
– how they behave, how they talk.

00:24:29.443 --> 00:24:34.203
And they are so innocent that they will
tell everything to everyone.

00:24:34.404 --> 00:24:40.679
They have no way of hiding anything,
it’s very difficult.

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:48.273
I know one joke: when a gentleman
came to the house for dinner.

00:24:48.474 --> 00:24:51.997
So the child was looking at him
very intensely.

00:24:52.198 --> 00:24:55.926
And then he says: “Mother, he doesn’t eat

00:24:56.127 --> 00:25:00.032
like a horse, as you told me!”.
So everybody was shocked!

00:25:00.233 --> 00:25:01.817
“You see, he doesn’t eat like a horse!”.

00:25:02.018 --> 00:25:04.298
Mother must have told him: “He eats
like a horse”.

00:25:04.499 --> 00:25:07.192
So he looked at him: “He doesn’t
eat like a horse!”. You see,

00:25:07.393 --> 00:25:10.883
they are so innocent sometimes,
they say things,

00:25:11.084 --> 00:25:13.872
by which you can get exposed completely.

00:25:14.073 --> 00:25:19.575
There are so many jokes about it. And if
you write some books,

00:25:19.776 --> 00:25:24.485
writing the jokes of children, I tell you,
people will just enjoy it.

00:25:24.686 --> 00:25:30.133
Because so innocently they say things,
which are nothing but the truth.

00:25:30.334 --> 00:25:34.438
And they cannot tell lies. They are
so truthful,

00:25:34.639 --> 00:25:39.258
that’s the quality of innocence.
They never tell lies.

00:25:39.459 --> 00:25:41.676
“You did this?” “Yes, I did.”

00:25:41.877 --> 00:25:46.235
“You didn’t do this?” “No, I didn’t do.”
They never tell lies.

00:25:46.436 --> 00:25:55.521
It is we, the grown-ups teach them to how
to tell lies, how to be cheating.

00:25:57.002 --> 00:26:00.235
Then we teach also our children another
bad thing,

00:26:00.436 --> 00:26:03.567
that is, “You must possess everything.”

00:26:03.768 --> 00:26:08.059
Especially in the West, is a thing they do.

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:13.783
They tell the child that: “This is yours,
you should not give it to anyone,

00:26:13.984 --> 00:26:16.153
this is your own.”

00:26:16.354 --> 00:26:21.294
On the contrary, you should tell them:
“You can do what you like.”

00:26:21.495 --> 00:26:22.978
Leave it to their innocence.

00:26:23.179 --> 00:26:26.911
You’ll be amazed, they’ll give up
everything that they have.

00:26:27.112 --> 00:26:30.688
In such a beautiful manner they’ll behave,
that you’ll be amazed

00:26:30.889 --> 00:26:38.223
how they try to please everyone, and try
to do something to entertain you.

00:26:38.424 --> 00:26:42.930
All their capacity of this is so great
that sometimes

00:26:43.131 --> 00:26:47.555
one wonders how these little things
have developed these capacities.

00:26:47.756 --> 00:26:52.067
It is the blessings of Shri Ganesha.
Is His blessings

00:26:52.268 --> 00:26:59.415
that children are so very sweet and
so much entertaining, and so beautiful.

00:26:59.616 --> 00:27:03.036
Try to become like them. We have to be
like them.

00:27:03.237 --> 00:27:07.001
You might have read many books, you might
have got lots of degrees,

00:27:07.202 --> 00:27:11.868
you might be something great, but you are
not a childlike.

00:27:12.069 --> 00:27:20.215
You have to be a childlike person.
Otherwise, no one likes your company.

00:27:20.416 --> 00:27:24.235
We call them bores. But actually boring
comes with the people

00:27:24.436 --> 00:27:29.609
who have no innocence in their heart.
They are trying to tell you:

00:27:30.428 --> 00:27:35.079
“You must do this. If you want to be
successful, you do that.”

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:38.145
All these lectures are useless
for children.

00:27:38.346 --> 00:27:42.657
In the same way, it should be within
your own understanding

00:27:42.858 --> 00:27:45.778
that it’s all nonsense they are talking.

00:27:45.979 --> 00:27:49.907
As the children don’t care for what
you suggest to them –

00:27:50.108 --> 00:27:54.485
to be nasty, to be horrid – in the same
way, if you are innocent

00:27:54.686 --> 00:27:58.911
you will not accept it. You may listen
to anything,

00:27:59.112 --> 00:28:02.923
let them tell you anything they want to,
doesn’t matter.

00:28:03.124 --> 00:28:07.639
You’ll never do that, because you cannot,
because you are innocent.

00:28:07.874 --> 00:28:11.739
And the innocence will guard you, it will
give you proper guidance

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:14.923
what is to be done, what is not to be
done.

00:28:15.124 --> 00:28:21.149
Now try to introspect and see for yourself:
“Are you innocent or not?”

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:26.749
People think that somebody is trying
to overpower you,

00:28:27.233 --> 00:28:34.313
is trying to harm you, is trying to put
you down.

00:28:34.514 --> 00:28:37.141
Nobody can put down innocence.

00:28:37.342 --> 00:28:42.958
Innocence is a quality that survives
all kinds of nonsense.

00:28:43.159 --> 00:28:51.080
And not only that, but age, your health,
your mind,

00:28:51.913 --> 00:28:57.602
your thinking, and your emotions,

00:28:57.803 --> 00:29:04.354
are extremely innocent and you enjoy
yourself.

00:29:05.776 --> 00:29:10.722
Nowadays, there’s a big wave

00:29:13.329 --> 00:29:16.755
of shamelessness. Sometimes they have.

00:29:18.315 --> 00:29:21.219
The people I’ve seen, they have no Lajja.

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:23.989
I don’t know, some men want to attract
women

00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:28.372
and some women want to attract men.
Children never do like that.

00:29:28.573 --> 00:29:32.641
They don’t know what is this ‘to attract
men’ or ‘to attract women’,

00:29:32.842 --> 00:29:39.083
or ‘attract’ anyone. They’ll try to please
the dog, they’ll try to please a horse,

00:29:39.284 --> 00:29:45.778
but they never I’ve seen going all out
to attract someone.

00:29:45.979 --> 00:29:51.870
The reason is this, that their self-esteem
is complete.

00:29:52.709 --> 00:29:55.528
They know about themselves fully.

00:29:55.729 --> 00:29:57.669
So why should they do all this nonsense

00:29:57.870 --> 00:30:03.559
of running after women, running after men
and creating problems for themselves?

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:08.048
Their self-esteem is complete. Innocence
is like that.

00:30:08.249 --> 00:30:12.001
It gives you a complete self-esteem.

00:30:12.202 --> 00:30:16.626
You don’t bow to anyone, nor you make
anybody else to bow.

00:30:16.827 --> 00:30:21.501
This is the beauty of innocence, which
works out so well within you.

00:30:21.702 --> 00:30:26.676
That’s why I always say that: “Worship
Shri Ganesha!”

00:30:26.877 --> 00:30:34.673
I know of somebody who was very highly
placed.

00:30:34.874 --> 00:30:41.493
And suddenly I was surprised how
he was paralysed.

00:30:41.694 --> 00:30:47.624
What happened? He was a very good man,
he should not have been paralysed.

00:30:48.022 --> 00:30:57.767
Then I found out that he had very bad
intentions about women,

00:30:58.354 --> 00:31:01.985
and that’s how he got this problem.

00:31:02.186 --> 00:31:06.809
So I told him: “You’d better worship
Ganesha. You worship Shri Ganesha”.

00:31:07.010 --> 00:31:10.915
Worshipping the Shri Ganesha improves
your Mooladhara,

00:31:11.151 --> 00:31:19.122
improves your sense of shame, improves
of your own dignity, self-esteem.

00:31:19.323 --> 00:31:25.110
You dress up in a way that shows that
you respect your body.

00:31:25.311 --> 00:31:30.301
You talk in such a way that shows that
you respect your tongue,

00:31:30.502 --> 00:31:35.673
your language. You cannot have a foul
mouth if you are an innocent person.

00:31:35.874 --> 00:31:43.204
Cannot have a mind that can abuse
or can say horrible words.

00:31:43.405 --> 00:31:48.969
I have seen, in America, they talk in such
a funny manner that you are shocked.

00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:54.438
There’s no need to use these dirty words
to express yourself.

00:31:54.639 --> 00:31:59.915
With that, your tongue gets spoiled.
So innocence is gone from your tongue.

00:32:00.116 --> 00:32:02.247
If you have lost innocence from
your tongue,

00:32:02.448 --> 00:32:06.579
whatever you say will never come true –
will never come true.

00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:09.794
But if you are innocent, and your tongue
is innocent

00:32:09.995 --> 00:32:13.376
and respects… So the basic, as you
can see,

00:32:13.577 --> 00:32:16.270
is respect your innocence in every manner.

00:32:16.471 --> 00:32:22.505
Like, when you have to get angry with
somebody or say something,

00:32:22.706 --> 00:32:24.626
just keep quiet is the best way.

00:32:24.827 --> 00:32:30.907
Or else you must respect your tongue,
respect your eyes.

00:32:31.143 --> 00:32:36.141
Some people have a very bad habit of roving
their eyes all over, looking at women;

00:32:36.342 --> 00:32:41.165
or some women are like that. You don’t
respect your eyes,

00:32:41.366 --> 00:32:46.891
then they develop problems of the eyes.
Not only that, but mind also.

00:32:47.092 --> 00:32:54.118
Mind gets so much ruined by this kind
of behaviour that it has no sense.

00:32:54.319 --> 00:32:58.829
It cannot enjoy anything. Such a person
cannot enjoy anything.

00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:06.420
If you are a person who respects your eyes,
your nose, your ears –

00:33:07.385 --> 00:33:13.012
I tell you, you’ll be amazed. Everything is
so enjoyable.

00:33:13.213 --> 00:33:16.454
In this world there are so many things
to be enjoyed.

00:33:16.655 --> 00:33:19.426
But people can’t hear anything that is
good.

00:33:19.627 --> 00:33:22.665
There are birds who are chirping –
they can’t hear.

00:33:22.866 --> 00:33:25.544
There are trees, which are growing,
they can’t see.

00:33:25.745 --> 00:33:29.317
There are flowers, which have fragrance –
they cannot smell.

00:33:29.518 --> 00:33:33.837
Because they are so much low
in their self-esteem,

00:33:34.038 --> 00:33:37.497
because they are very low-level people,
I should say,

00:33:37.698 --> 00:33:40.735
who cannot enjoy everything around.

00:33:40.936 --> 00:33:43.602
And they should be a source of enjoyment.

00:33:43.803 --> 00:33:47.645
You see children, how they are source
of enjoyment!

00:33:47.846 --> 00:33:51.735
Anybody who comes on the stage and
runs about, I mean, how we enjoy.

00:33:51.936 --> 00:33:54.872
Why? Why do we enjoy a child running
about?

00:33:55.073 --> 00:33:59.700
We don’t say he’s gone amuck, or he’s
drunk, but we enjoy the child. Why?

00:33:59.901 --> 00:34:04.766
What is the sweetness of that child that
makes us so happy?

00:34:04.967 --> 00:34:09.684
Because that’s innocence. His power
is innocence.

00:34:09.885 --> 00:34:14.840
With that power, he is just looking
so sweet, so beautiful

00:34:15.041 --> 00:34:18.376
that it gives us the real joy within us.

00:34:18.577 --> 00:34:23.555
So the second thing is that innocence
is joy-giving.

00:34:23.756 --> 00:34:29.086
Innocence gives joy to people. Anything
said innocently,

00:34:29.287 --> 00:34:34.618
anything done innocently is very,
very joy-giving.

00:34:34.819 --> 00:34:42.497
And, in that, you see the person
so transparent, so beautiful,

00:34:42.698 --> 00:34:52.172
that you enjoy that transparency and
that sanctified innocence.

00:34:52.373 --> 00:34:55.497
That’s why Ganesha is worshipped first.

00:34:55.698 --> 00:35:02.688
Because Ganesha was the first Deity
that was created by Adi Shakti.

00:35:02.889 --> 00:35:08.876
Because, if She has to create something,

00:35:09.077 --> 00:35:11.598
She must know that there has to be
power of innocence.

00:35:11.799 --> 00:35:15.985
Otherwise people will go wrong, they’ll
do all kinds of wrong things.

00:35:16.186 --> 00:35:20.516
So first She created Ganesha, whose
innocence –

00:35:20.717 --> 00:35:26.251
you can call the vibrations – are so strong
that it controls.

00:35:26.452 --> 00:35:30.543
Of course, there are people who have
abandoned completely

00:35:30.744 --> 00:35:35.145
their innocence and they think no end
of themselves. Just forget about them!

00:35:35.346 --> 00:35:41.942
But normally, normally, you are always
guided by your innocence,

00:35:42.143 --> 00:35:47.395
whether you are aware of it or not,
and that is such a sweet thing.

00:35:47.596 --> 00:35:50.948
Such a sweet thing that it makes

00:35:51.149 --> 00:35:54.774
people rise in their nobleness,
in their greatness.

00:35:54.975 --> 00:35:59.727
And that is what we have to develop in us,
the sahaj yogis.

00:35:59.928 --> 00:36:03.653
When sahaj yogis go anywhere, try to do
anything,

00:36:03.854 --> 00:36:06.161
meet anybody, any social work

00:36:06.362 --> 00:36:12.024
anything, people should feel that joy that
you have within yourself.

00:36:12.225 --> 00:36:15.635
It’s for that joy only

00:36:16.994 --> 00:36:20.770
the Adi Shakti created Shri Ganesha.

00:36:20.971 --> 00:36:26.145
Because that joy within, of innocent joy,
which doesn’t harm anybody,

00:36:26.346 --> 00:36:29.344
which doesn’t expect anything, which
doesn’t demand anything,

00:36:29.545 --> 00:36:35.176
which doesn’t want anything, but just
emitting joy all over -

00:36:35.377 --> 00:36:38.473
that sort of a personality you should have.

00:36:38.674 --> 00:36:41.766
There’s nothing wrong in wearing good
dresses,

00:36:41.967 --> 00:36:44.555
nothing wrong in eating good food,

00:36:44.756 --> 00:36:49.258
nothing wrong in having conversations
with people.

00:36:49.459 --> 00:36:54.001
But in all that, it is the respect
of the innocence,

00:36:54.225 --> 00:36:57.036
the expression of innocence should be
there.

00:36:57.237 --> 00:37:01.657
With this innocence we can solve
the problems –

00:37:01.858 --> 00:37:04.387
all the problems of the world can be
solved.

00:37:04.588 --> 00:37:07.891
That’s why Shri Ganesha is so important.

00:37:08.092 --> 00:37:14.165
If you do not have proper understanding
of Shri Ganesha,

00:37:14.366 --> 00:37:20.852
and if your Shri Ganesha is in a jeopardy,
I don’t know what can happen to you.

00:37:21.053 --> 00:37:26.352
These days, see, so many horrible diseases
are coming,

00:37:26.553 --> 00:37:31.446
because they are not sanctified. Their
relationships are not sanctified.

00:37:31.647 --> 00:37:35.958
Every relationship has to be sanctified
with your innocence.

00:37:36.159 --> 00:37:40.700
Like, you have a sister, you have a mother,
you have a brother,

00:37:40.901 --> 00:37:44.872
you have a father, you have all these
relationships.

00:37:45.073 --> 00:37:49.727
And these all relationships they are
so good, so beautiful and sanctified,

00:37:49.928 --> 00:37:54.485
because there is the relationship
of innocence.

00:37:54.686 --> 00:37:59.961
You love your father out of innocence, and
you love your daughter out of innocence,

00:38:00.162 --> 00:38:04.555
you love your mother out of innocence.
Why should you love,

00:38:04.756 --> 00:38:08.379
for some sort of a gain? Then it’s
cunning.

00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:14.692
For some sort of an overpowering?
Then it’s cunning.

00:38:14.893 --> 00:38:19.293
It’s just for love’s, love’s sake. That’s
possible if you are innocent.

00:38:19.494 --> 00:38:23.266
So now I’m happy: tomorrow you are
all going to get married.

00:38:23.467 --> 00:38:26.059
And those people who are getting married
should understand

00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:29.813
that it’s a sanctified marriage.
It’s very important.

00:38:30.014 --> 00:38:36.645
It’s not like any other marriage. It’s the
marriage taking place in my presence.

00:38:36.846 --> 00:38:42.012
So be careful! Now, if you do not want
to marry, all right, finish it.

00:38:42.213 --> 00:38:45.118
You have been given a chance to know
the person, to understand it.

00:38:45.319 --> 00:38:49.293
But afterwards, if you try to be funny,
it’s going to be very difficult

00:38:49.494 --> 00:38:54.778
for you and for me. I may give up having
marriages.

00:38:54.979 --> 00:39:00.854
So I don’t like people to talk of divorce
from the very first day.

00:39:01.647 --> 00:39:05.036
But if there is really a problem,

00:39:05.237 --> 00:39:10.508
it’s all right, in Sahaja Yoga, we have
allowed divorce.

00:39:10.709 --> 00:39:13.645
Not, say, the Catholic Church, they don’t
allow divorce.

00:39:13.846 --> 00:39:17.494
So men have all kinds of relationships
and women have all kinds of relationships.

00:39:17.695 --> 00:39:22.700
That’s not there. Instead of doing this
kind of a nonsense, you can have a divorce.

00:39:22.901 --> 00:39:28.318
But it should be very innocent happening.

00:39:28.519 --> 00:39:32.837
That if you are divorcing a person because
your innocence is challenged,

00:39:33.038 --> 00:39:37.446
it’s all right. There, I agree with you
that you should have.

00:39:37.647 --> 00:39:39.840
So preserve your innocence.

00:39:40.041 --> 00:39:45.614
In these modern times, it’s very important
to preserve your innocence,

00:39:45.815 --> 00:39:53.461
that Shri Ganesh should be awakened
within you, and also in other people.

00:39:53.662 --> 00:39:57.404
That is going to save this world.
Nothing else,

00:39:57.605 --> 00:40:02.301
but the innocence that you have,
is going to save the world.

00:40:02.502 --> 00:40:08.208
Whatever you may know, whatever you
may say, whatever you may write,

00:40:08.409 --> 00:40:13.739
please see that you are not hurting
the innocence within you.

00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:20.114
It’s not necessary to lead a life
of morality, this, that.

00:40:20.315 --> 00:40:22.558
What is needed is your innocence.

00:40:22.759 --> 00:40:28.253
Innocence itself gives you moral strength,
moral understanding.

00:40:28.454 --> 00:40:33.401
You don’t have to read books for that,
you don’t have to go to any guru for that.

00:40:33.602 --> 00:40:39.511
Innocence will guide you and tell you
that: “This is what is sahaj,

00:40:39.712 --> 00:40:44.089
this is what you have to have.” You all
have got Realization,

00:40:44.290 --> 00:40:47.413
is a very big thing, that has happened
to so many people.

00:40:47.614 --> 00:40:53.382
And I always want you to worship
Shri Ganesh within you.

00:40:53.583 --> 00:40:57.772
Shri Ganesh is your innocence, it is
the Spirit within you.

00:40:57.973 --> 00:41:02.808
When you want to know your Spirit,
it is Shri Ganesha you become one,

00:41:03.009 --> 00:41:06.304
one with Shri Ganesh. It is within you,

00:41:06.505 --> 00:41:09.737
and is absolutely possible for all of you

00:41:09.938 --> 00:41:17.216
to be completely enlightened by the power
of Shri Ganesha.

00:41:18.091 --> 00:41:22.163
I’m very happy that you have accepted
all the marriages,

00:41:22.364 --> 00:41:24.398
and you have decided to marry.

00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:28.343
But, even now, if you say no, it’s better
to finish it off.

00:41:28.544 --> 00:41:31.894
But don’t try any tricks, and don’t try
to be funny,

00:41:32.095 --> 00:41:36.503
because that is not going to help you
in any way to enjoy your marriage.

00:41:36.704 --> 00:41:41.917
From the very first day, try to understand
that you have to be very kind.

00:41:42.118 --> 00:41:45.890
Kind to your partner, very respectful,

00:41:46.091 --> 00:41:50.561
very caring, very loving. That’s a very
important thing,

00:41:50.762 --> 00:41:54.261
which people don’t understand. And do not
take for granted:

00:41:54.462 --> 00:41:57.561
“It’s alright because it’s a sahaj
marriage”, people take it for granted.

00:41:57.762 --> 00:42:01.245
No, never take it for granted. If you want
to have real joy,

00:42:01.446 --> 00:42:05.901
then have innocent love between yourself
and enjoy yourself.

00:42:06.102 --> 00:42:08.724
May God bless you. Thank you.
