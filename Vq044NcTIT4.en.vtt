00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:03.161
1991-0410 Virata Puja, Melbourne, Australia

00:00:04.325 --> 00:00:06.925
Because of distances and

00:00:07.054 --> 00:00:10.734
also that we have no ashram  in Melbourne all these days;

00:00:11.014 --> 00:00:15.454
I've found that the collectivity is no yet

00:00:15.734 --> 00:00:17.814
properly woven here.

00:00:17.934 --> 00:00:20.254
So I think that the best thing is today

00:00:20.374 --> 00:00:24.294
we must worship the Virata.

00:00:24.414 --> 00:00:29.134
Virata is the primordial father, you can say,

00:00:29.254 --> 00:00:35.214
or the one who is in our brain acts

00:00:35.574 --> 00:00:37.534
for our collectivity.

00:00:49.014 --> 00:00:53.774
As the Kundalini rises ultimately she ends up

00:00:54.934 --> 00:00:58.774
by piercing through the fontanel bone area.

00:00:59.014 --> 00:01:01.814
Before entering into that

00:01:02.734 --> 00:01:07.294
she enters into the Sahasrara.

00:01:07.414 --> 00:01:10.494
Sahasrara is the area

00:01:10.614 --> 00:01:13.294
which is surrounded by

00:01:13.414 --> 00:01:15.574
one thousand nerves

00:01:15.694 --> 00:01:18.854
and in the medical terms

00:01:18.974 --> 00:01:21.854
it is called as limbic area.

00:01:22.854 --> 00:01:26.734
Now one thousand nerves

00:01:26.854 --> 00:01:30.614
are all connected

00:01:30.734 --> 00:01:36.454
to the sixteen important nerves of the Vishuddhi.

00:01:36.814 --> 00:01:39.174
That's why they say that Shri Krishna had

00:01:39.294 --> 00:01:42.414
sixteen thousand wives, that is,

00:01:42.534 --> 00:01:46.454
He had all His powers as His wives

00:01:46.574 --> 00:01:50.854
and I have all My powers as My children.

00:01:56.014 --> 00:01:59.774
So when we are growing in our ascent,

00:01:59.894 --> 00:02:01.894
in our dhyana,

00:02:02.014 --> 00:02:07.774
we have to go to our Sahasrara.

00:02:11.494 --> 00:02:16.414
If the Sahasrara was not opened out,

00:02:16.654 --> 00:02:21.494
we could not have done this en masse realization.

00:02:21.814 --> 00:02:23.494
How it is connected,

00:02:23.614 --> 00:02:26.294
the collectivity is so connected

00:02:26.414 --> 00:02:30.854
with the present-day Sahaja Yoga.

00:02:33.494 --> 00:02:38.054
Before that it was just

00:02:39.614 --> 00:02:42.294
up to the Agnya chakra

00:02:43.094 --> 00:02:47.654
but when it reaches the Sahasrara

00:02:47.774 --> 00:02:51.014
it enlightens all the nerves,

00:02:51.134 --> 00:02:54.774
and all the nerves look like

00:02:54.894 --> 00:02:58.094
flames which are very silent,

00:02:58.214 --> 00:03:01.974
beautifully colored in all vigor colors.

00:03:02.094 --> 00:03:03.974
The

00:03:05.174 --> 00:03:09.174
appearance of these is so soothing and so beautiful

00:03:09.294 --> 00:03:13.774
that there's no better view in the whole world, I think,

00:03:13.894 --> 00:03:17.014
that human beings can see.

00:03:17.574 --> 00:03:21.294
So when this Sahasrara was opened out,

00:03:21.414 --> 00:03:24.454
which we are having now a puja as you know,

00:03:24.574 --> 00:03:27.654
in Rome

00:03:28.094 --> 00:03:32.374
before that it had to go to the collective,

00:03:32.494 --> 00:03:36.214
that is, I had to pay My attention to the collective.

00:03:36.334 --> 00:03:39.094
I had to see the people,

00:03:39.214 --> 00:03:42.334
their different problems,

00:03:42.454 --> 00:03:45.734
the permutations and combinations

00:03:45.854 --> 00:03:49.454
by which they are all suffering.

00:03:50.334 --> 00:03:55.614
They can all be brought to the seven major

00:03:57.654 --> 00:03:59.494
notes, we can say,

00:03:59.614 --> 00:04:05.134
but they are also divided into twenty-one -

00:04:05.254 --> 00:04:08.774
one on the left, one on the right and one in the center.

00:04:08.894 --> 00:04:11.414
So we have also gather twenty-one

00:04:11.534 --> 00:04:14.134
really basic problems,

00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:16.254
fundamental problems within us

00:04:16.374 --> 00:04:18.534
which we have to solve.

00:04:18.654 --> 00:04:20.774
We have, in the beginning of Sahaja Yoga,

00:04:20.894 --> 00:04:24.374
I tried only to cure people of their physical problems,

00:04:24.494 --> 00:04:28.214
mental problems, their family problems, financial problems,

00:04:28.334 --> 00:04:32.574
all kinds of problems have been solved

00:04:32.734 --> 00:04:34.894
in Sahaja Yoga,

00:04:35.014 --> 00:04:38.654
and we have had some very great mishaps in between.

00:04:38.774 --> 00:04:41.774
As you know that when they came up to the Agnya

00:04:41.894 --> 00:04:44.974
they started taking over

00:04:45.094 --> 00:04:47.614
the whole atmosphere

00:04:47.734 --> 00:04:50.654
by some sort of a authority

00:04:50.774 --> 00:04:53.694
which was not God's authority.

00:04:53.814 --> 00:04:59.014
As a result, many people went out at the Agnya

00:04:59.134 --> 00:05:03.774
but those who have come to Sahasrara have to understand

00:05:03.894 --> 00:05:09.374
that collectivity is the basic of your ascent.

00:05:09.494 --> 00:05:12.094
If you are not collective,

00:05:12.774 --> 00:05:15.774
if you do not come to the center,

00:05:15.894 --> 00:05:18.774
if you do not meet each other,

00:05:18.894 --> 00:05:23.654
then you are like a nail which is cut out of the finger and

00:05:24.494 --> 00:05:27.654
the Divine has nothing to do with you - you are out of the tree,

00:05:27.774 --> 00:05:34.254
like the flowers which have come out of the tree

00:05:35.014 --> 00:05:37.374
can exist for a while, no doubt,

00:05:37.494 --> 00:05:41.174
but after some time they are dead and finished.

00:05:41.294 --> 00:05:44.494
So it is important for all of you to understand

00:05:44.614 --> 00:05:49.574
that collectivity, if it is not established in Sahaja Yoga,

00:05:49.694 --> 00:05:52.334
Sahaja Yoga will die out.

00:05:52.454 --> 00:05:56.654
I am now going to America where collectivity

00:05:56.774 --> 00:06:00.014
has to be really of the maximum nature,

00:06:00.134 --> 00:06:02.374
but it is not so.

00:06:02.494 --> 00:06:06.974
There are so many problems on collectivity in America,

00:06:07.094 --> 00:06:10.734
but still I would say that they realize one thing,

00:06:10.854 --> 00:06:13.214
that they have to be very collective.

00:06:13.334 --> 00:06:16.254
The problems are like there are very few people

00:06:16.374 --> 00:06:18.414
who are Sahaja Yogis there,

00:06:18.534 --> 00:06:20.574
but among themselves

00:06:20.694 --> 00:06:24.374
they understand responsibility. They are all working very hard.

00:06:24.494 --> 00:06:26.894
They are spreading Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:27.014 --> 00:06:30.814
Now you see the have this ''Cool Breeze'' started from there,

00:06:30.934 --> 00:06:34.734
there are so many activities they are doing in America

00:06:34.854 --> 00:06:37.614
with such a small number that it is amazing

00:06:37.734 --> 00:06:39.974
how they are managing these things,

00:06:40.094 --> 00:06:42.174
and they do it very beautifully

00:06:42.294 --> 00:06:45.894
because they feel joined together; they are so far away,

00:06:46.014 --> 00:06:49.494
from Honolulu to New York is such a long distance.

00:06:49.614 --> 00:06:52.934
But there's such a lot of understanding,

00:06:53.054 --> 00:06:55.254
such a lot of love

00:06:55.374 --> 00:06:57.734
and sense of responsibility.

00:06:57.854 --> 00:07:01.654
Because they are a small number they feel extremely responsible

00:07:01.774 --> 00:07:04.614
that we have to be absolutely collective

00:07:04.734 --> 00:07:07.614
- no question of having groups.

00:07:07.734 --> 00:07:10.214
Even if somebody makes mistakes or something,

00:07:10.334 --> 00:07:15.134
they never talk about it to anybody else but to Me.

00:07:15.374 --> 00:07:18.294
They never discuss about each other,

00:07:18.414 --> 00:07:20.894
they never talk ill about each other,

00:07:21.014 --> 00:07:23.294
they never form any groups.

00:07:23.414 --> 00:07:27.254
The children are outside. Who are? Just they can came here, there is space.

00:07:27.374 --> 00:07:31.294
Can you have little bit up in there?

00:07:32.854 --> 00:07:36.134
Just make them space in between. Come along!

00:07:53.934 --> 00:07:58.694
Children can sit in the front they don't occupate much space.

00:08:00.934 --> 00:08:04.534
Children can even sit on your laps.

00:08:07.534 --> 00:08:09.134
Can you move?

00:08:09.254 --> 00:08:12.094
You can make a gap in between.

00:08:13.094 --> 00:08:16.734
Now, this is question of collectivity.

00:08:20.854 --> 00:08:23.374
Bring the children up here.

00:08:23.494 --> 00:08:27.334
All the children can come along, they can help me in puja

00:08:27.454 --> 00:08:29.894
they are very good at helping.

00:08:30.014 --> 00:08:30.974
yes.

00:08:43.614 --> 00:08:46.494
Yes, yes, come along.

00:08:48.174 --> 00:08:52.814
Poor children were kept out, can you imagine?

00:08:59.414 --> 00:09:02.254
Sit down, sit down, sit down.

00:09:07.054 --> 00:09:11.094
Sit down, sit down, here, sit down. Now.

00:09:11.654 --> 00:09:16.174
Come along, come along, come here, come here.

00:09:24.694 --> 00:09:28.054
Now, who are outside now?

00:09:33.934 --> 00:09:38.094
See if small children are there.

00:09:42.454 --> 00:09:45.254
Come along, come along.

00:09:49.454 --> 00:09:53.614
I think if you could sit little, not with such a big

00:09:53.734 --> 00:09:56.094
assan, little smaller assan

00:09:56.214 --> 00:09:58.734
People can come.

00:10:00.334 --> 00:10:03.694
And I think open a window also is important

00:10:09.654 --> 00:10:11.894
Yes there is some space

00:10:12.134 --> 00:10:14.094
if there are tree cameras,

00:10:14.214 --> 00:10:16.574
then how can't there be space.

00:10:18.734 --> 00:10:21.134
I think you can have one camera in there

00:10:21.254 --> 00:10:23.134
and they can sit inside.

00:10:23.254 --> 00:10:25.374
All right.

00:10:31.414 --> 00:10:33.174
All right.

00:10:53.414 --> 00:10:56.044
You all should sit with one

00:10:56.654 --> 00:10:59.494
one knee up like that so there is more space

00:10:59.774 --> 00:11:01.734
just like Babamama is sitting.

00:11:18.934 --> 00:11:21.134
Give it to in Chaaya's lap.

00:12:33.414 --> 00:12:35.174
Don't spread out your self, little bit

00:12:35.334 --> 00:12:38.054
pull your one leg like that on top.

00:12:38.414 --> 00:12:40.894
Yes, one straight one like this

00:12:41.014 --> 00:12:43.294
even easier to sit that way.

00:12:48.734 --> 00:12:50.654
Easier to sit.

00:12:56.254 --> 00:12:59.054
Now this is the sense of collectivity,

00:13:00.174 --> 00:13:02.814
that it's in a small hall - doesn't matter -

00:13:02.934 --> 00:13:05.054
we are all together,

00:13:05.734 --> 00:13:08.694
and how are we going to get all of them inside,

00:13:09.814 --> 00:13:11.694
because you can't enjoy it

00:13:11.814 --> 00:13:15.054
unless and until all of you are together.

00:13:19.934 --> 00:13:22.494
Now, everybody has to keep quiet, all right children

00:13:22.614 --> 00:13:26.214
all of you, otherwise they will ask you again to go out.

00:13:28.414 --> 00:13:32.894
So now, let us see how do we

00:13:35.094 --> 00:13:38.534
miss out on collectivity.

00:13:41.414 --> 00:13:44.374
There's a very practical down-to-earth

00:13:44.734 --> 00:13:46.454
understanding.

00:13:47.614 --> 00:13:52.214
First we must know without collectivity we cannot exist.

00:13:53.774 --> 00:13:59.094
As the body has to be in connection with the brain,

00:13:59.574 --> 00:14:02.054
in the same way without collectivity

00:14:02.174 --> 00:14:04.694
Sahaja Yoga cannot exist.

00:14:09.054 --> 00:14:10.494
Once you understand that,

00:14:10.614 --> 00:14:13.254
then you have to work it out that collectivity

00:14:13.374 --> 00:14:17.894
is absolutely established within and without.

00:14:19.094 --> 00:14:21.934
It is more within that you have to establish,

00:14:22.054 --> 00:14:23.574
than without.

00:14:25.814 --> 00:14:30.294
Whatever you have within is manifested outside.

00:14:31.814 --> 00:14:36.134
Now how do we establish it within ourselves?

00:14:39.734 --> 00:14:41.974
First of all,

00:14:43.334 --> 00:14:47.614
we have to understand

00:14:47.734 --> 00:14:52.174
that now we are the relations of each other.

00:14:53.334 --> 00:14:56.854
Gyaneshwari said, "TechiSoyarikhoti."

00:15:20.414 --> 00:15:27.254
So the first thing is that within ourselves

00:15:27.614 --> 00:15:31.974
we have to see introspection, with introspection,

00:15:32.254 --> 00:15:37.134
what are we doing against collectivity in our mind,

00:15:38.134 --> 00:15:40.974
how our mind is working.

00:15:44.174 --> 00:15:45.774
I do not know

00:15:46.334 --> 00:15:49.334
what thing comes first in the human mind

00:15:49.574 --> 00:15:51.894
about another person,

00:15:52.294 --> 00:15:54.254
but the first thing is that

00:15:54.374 --> 00:15:57.374
these are your real relations

00:15:58.694 --> 00:16:04.134
and nobody else are your relations.

00:16:04.734 --> 00:16:07.534
These children are your children

00:16:09.174 --> 00:16:12.134
and these men are your brothers,

00:16:12.254 --> 00:16:14.454
and these ladies are your sisters,

00:16:14.774 --> 00:16:18.374
and we are one big family together.

00:16:21.214 --> 00:16:24.334
We are part and parcel of one body,

00:16:25.574 --> 00:16:29.894
and this hand cannot hit another hand,

00:16:30.094 --> 00:16:33.294
thank God it doesn't think, otherwise as human beings

00:16:33.414 --> 00:16:37.174
they might start thinking against another hand,

00:16:37.334 --> 00:16:38.574
but they don't

00:16:38.694 --> 00:16:43.254
because they are connected to one brain activity.

00:16:45.694 --> 00:16:48.774
So the first thing one has to understand

00:16:48.894 --> 00:16:53.774
that do not try to see the defects of another person,

00:16:54.454 --> 00:16:58.054
but goodness of another person.

00:17:01.454 --> 00:17:04.214
That is really going to help you the most.

00:17:04.334 --> 00:17:06.174
Like in India, you see, I don't know,

00:17:06.294 --> 00:17:12.054
here maybe the same: if you, if they know you,

00:17:12.174 --> 00:17:15.694
supposing, immediately they'll find out,

00:17:15.814 --> 00:17:19.174
now what work can we take out of this person.

00:17:19.294 --> 00:17:21.134
If somebody is a minister's brother,

00:17:21.254 --> 00:17:23.574
immediately they'll approach the minister's brother.

00:17:23.694 --> 00:17:26.054
All right, "Will you do this work for me?"

00:17:26.174 --> 00:17:28.534
Then somebody says, "l am such-and-such .. ."

00:17:28.654 --> 00:17:30.534
immediately people will think,

00:17:30.654 --> 00:17:34.214
"Oh, so what, what work can we get out of this person?"

00:17:35.934 --> 00:17:38.734
In the same way you can go little further

00:17:38.854 --> 00:17:40.774
in the language of Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:40.894 --> 00:17:42.974
As soon as you come to know about someone,

00:17:43.094 --> 00:17:46.814
you should not think what business I can do with him.

00:17:46.934 --> 00:17:49.134
I have seen immediately if somebody has money

00:17:49.254 --> 00:17:52.974
people will jump at him, all right, let's have the business together,

00:17:53.094 --> 00:17:55.334
even in Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:56.254 --> 00:17:58.614
Or if there is anything like that immediately they

00:17:58.734 --> 00:18:01.894
start employing that person for your purpose.

00:18:05.334 --> 00:18:08.454
On the contrary, what you have to do

00:18:08.574 --> 00:18:11.094
as soon as you know about somebody,

00:18:11.414 --> 00:18:15.294
then you have to think what goodness he has got,

00:18:15.414 --> 00:18:19.374
how can I imbibe that goodness within myself?

00:18:20.454 --> 00:18:25.254
Because we are here to enrich ourselves spiritually.

00:18:28.294 --> 00:18:31.334
So you must think as first and foremost thing,

00:18:31.454 --> 00:18:34.814
"What can I do to get

00:18:34.934 --> 00:18:38.734
the goodness of that person within myself?"

00:18:39.414 --> 00:18:41.614
So you'll be looking out

00:18:41.734 --> 00:18:43.414
for the goodness of that person

00:18:43.534 --> 00:18:47.454
than instead of looking out for bad qualities,

00:18:47.774 --> 00:18:51.694
because bad qualities are not going to nourish you at all.

00:18:52.014 --> 00:18:55.294
Also if somebody has bad qualities,

00:18:55.414 --> 00:18:58.294
no use thinking about you yourself

00:18:58.414 --> 00:19:00.654
because if you start thinking about it

00:19:00.774 --> 00:19:03.214
they are not going to be improved,

00:19:03.334 --> 00:19:06.054
it is somebody else's problem.

00:19:06.174 --> 00:19:10.534
The best thing is to look at another person

00:19:10.654 --> 00:19:13.254
with adoration and understanding,

00:19:13.374 --> 00:19:18.174
with love that he is one of us and what can I use?

00:19:18.294 --> 00:19:20.454
Now if I have the hand I don't have to think

00:19:20.574 --> 00:19:22.574
because we are programmed that way.

00:19:22.694 --> 00:19:24.734
If I have to hold this, automatically

00:19:24.854 --> 00:19:28.774
I use My hand, not My feet, I know My hands are holding,

00:19:28.894 --> 00:19:32.454
but when I have to walk, I don't walk with My hands

00:19:32.574 --> 00:19:34.774
because I know My feet have to walk.

00:19:34.894 --> 00:19:40.094
In the same way, you have to know which Sahaja Yogi

00:19:40.854 --> 00:19:47.214
is going to help you to nourish yourself.

00:19:47.894 --> 00:19:53.414
Immediately your mind will become very clear.

00:19:54.814 --> 00:19:58.014
Like now I saw some boy in

00:19:59.614 --> 00:20:01.214
New Zealand

00:20:02.254 --> 00:20:05.254
who was really about to be dead,

00:20:06.574 --> 00:20:12.614
and when he came back I found the
attitude towards him was not kind,

00:20:14.934 --> 00:20:16.814
as it should have been,

00:20:17.774 --> 00:20:20.654
but this is the best chance when you should see

00:20:20.774 --> 00:20:24.334
how you can practice your compassion.

00:20:25.854 --> 00:20:27.734
We talk of compassion, compassion.

00:20:27.854 --> 00:20:31.054
Now let us see how we can practice our compassion

00:20:31.174 --> 00:20:33.094
when this boy is so sick.

00:20:33.214 --> 00:20:35.934
On the contrary, everybody was harsh on him,

00:20:36.054 --> 00:20:40.734
they were passing remarks at him, doing things like that.

00:20:43.254 --> 00:20:45.774
Because we have to have compassion,

00:20:45.894 --> 00:20:48.774
now Mother has said we have to have compassion,

00:20:48.894 --> 00:20:51.054
well now where do we have our compassion, on the walls?

00:20:51.174 --> 00:20:53.334
Where do we use our compassion?

00:20:53.454 --> 00:20:56.054
Where do we use our compassion?

00:20:56.294 --> 00:21:00.214
So Sahaja Yoga is to be practiced, doesn't mean that you sit down

00:21:00.334 --> 00:21:04.014
with My photograph all the time, doesn't mean that.

00:21:04.134 --> 00:21:08.094
It means you practice compassion;

00:21:08.214 --> 00:21:10.774
you practice that.

00:21:13.254 --> 00:21:15.294
Then you have to practice love.

00:21:15.414 --> 00:21:18.374
Now how do you practice love with others?

00:21:18.494 --> 00:21:21.374
If you love someone, what do you do?

00:21:21.494 --> 00:21:23.894
You try to please that person.

00:21:25.334 --> 00:21:29.014
Small things can make people very happy.

00:21:29.134 --> 00:21:31.214
I know, you all try to please Me very much,

00:21:31.334 --> 00:21:32.654
you give Me presents,

00:21:32.774 --> 00:21:35.014
you find out things which are good for Me,

00:21:35.134 --> 00:21:38.014
you go out of the way buy sweet flowers for Me,

00:21:38.134 --> 00:21:40.094
beautiful things you do to please Me.

00:21:40.214 --> 00:21:42.694
I am over-pleased, I must tell you,

00:21:43.814 --> 00:21:47.774
but I am more pleased, much more pleased

00:21:47.894 --> 00:21:50.014
if you understand collectivity

00:21:50.134 --> 00:21:53.374
and try to please each other.

00:21:53.494 --> 00:21:56.214
Such a person pleases Me the most

00:21:56.334 --> 00:22:01.014
that the attention is more on pleasing each other.

00:22:03.134 --> 00:22:05.734
As soon as you decide you have to please others,

00:22:05.854 --> 00:22:07.894
your tongue will become different.

00:22:08.014 --> 00:22:10.574
It will become much sweeter.

00:22:11.174 --> 00:22:14.334
The tongue which was like a pair of scissors

00:22:14.454 --> 00:22:17.814
becomes such a beautiful thing of honey.

00:22:18.414 --> 00:22:20.134
Then you talk little but

00:22:20.254 --> 00:22:22.334
you really pour honey on another person,

00:22:22.494 --> 00:22:26.054
so to the another person really enjoys it.

00:22:26.174 --> 00:22:29.814
So now the practice love where do you practice?

00:22:30.094 --> 00:22:32.974
Ask you a question: where do I practice love?

00:22:35.334 --> 00:22:37.414
What do I love?

00:22:37.934 --> 00:22:40.014
We live, love our house,

00:22:40.134 --> 00:22:42.214
we love our photographs,

00:22:42.334 --> 00:22:44.214
our decorations, everything,

00:22:44.334 --> 00:22:47.374
but do I practice this love on my wife,

00:22:47.494 --> 00:22:51.494
or on my husband,

00:22:51.894 --> 00:22:54.934
or on other Sahaja Yogis?

00:22:58.214 --> 00:22:59.934
In our Sahaj culture

00:23:00.054 --> 00:23:04.614
we have to practice compassion and love,

00:23:08.294 --> 00:23:11.214
and thirdly we have to practice patience.

00:23:12.734 --> 00:23:15.454
I know some children are maybe

00:23:15.574 --> 00:23:18.934
little more mischievous ... and others less mischievous,

00:23:19.334 --> 00:23:21.774
maybe some people are very talkative,

00:23:21.894 --> 00:23:25.134
sometimes really they give Me also headache;

00:23:25.614 --> 00:23:28.254
they go on talking, talking, talking, talking, so much!

00:23:29.574 --> 00:23:31.294
Sometimes I think it's good

00:23:31.414 --> 00:23:33.734
because it's a rest for My mouth:

00:23:36.094 --> 00:23:37.694
one way of looking at it.

00:23:37.814 --> 00:23:40.774
Another way of looking at it is just switch off your mind,

00:23:40.894 --> 00:23:43.614
let him talk, take it out whatever it was.

00:23:44.934 --> 00:23:47.774
Once he is finished with it and fagged out

00:23:47.894 --> 00:23:51.614
then he won't bother you much

00:23:51.734 --> 00:23:53.414
and also he'll feel satisfied

00:23:53.534 --> 00:23:56.614
that somebody has listened to his prattles.

00:23:57.094 --> 00:23:58.814
So patience is needed

00:23:58.934 --> 00:24:01.414
and patience is needed

00:24:02.174 --> 00:24:06.654
in such a way that others should see your patience.

00:24:06.774 --> 00:24:09.494
Yesterday for example, I was sitting for about I think

00:24:09.614 --> 00:24:13.254
three hours shaking hands with all sorts of people

00:24:14.214 --> 00:24:16.814
and all types of problems,

00:24:17.334 --> 00:24:20.454
and the person who came last, he said,

00:24:20.574 --> 00:24:24.574
"Looking at Your patience, I develop my own patience."

00:24:28.014 --> 00:24:31.054
And love gives you patience.

00:24:32.134 --> 00:24:35.254
This love nourishes you.

00:24:36.014 --> 00:24:40.774
I'm telling you, it's absolutely down-to-earth method:

00:24:40.894 --> 00:24:43.574
here I've not mentioned that you trust God,

00:24:43.694 --> 00:24:46.094
I am just saying trust yourself.

00:24:46.614 --> 00:24:48.174
Absolutely down-to-earth

00:24:48.294 --> 00:24:51.454
because we are talking about your brain.

00:24:52.374 --> 00:24:54.574
Now we have been saying

00:24:54.694 --> 00:24:57.294
that we have to forgive everyone,

00:24:57.614 --> 00:25:00.134
but we don't practice that.

00:25:00.974 --> 00:25:04.934
Small, small things like mad people we remember,

00:25:05.054 --> 00:25:08.654
that only I have heard that snake has this capacity

00:25:08.774 --> 00:25:11.134
to remember if somebody has hurt him,

00:25:11.254 --> 00:25:14.854
but here I find human beings have no less capacity.

00:25:14.974 --> 00:25:17.094
Whatever has happened 13 years back,

00:25:17.214 --> 00:25:18.854
15 years back, they all remember

00:25:18.974 --> 00:25:21.774
- each and every thing: whatever has hurt them,

00:25:21.894 --> 00:25:25.694
but how they have hurt others they don't remember,

00:25:25.814 --> 00:25:27.614
how they have been nasty to others

00:25:27.734 --> 00:25:29.494
they don't remember,

00:25:29.614 --> 00:25:32.294
because this is a human

00:25:32.454 --> 00:25:34.974
mind which has got the ego

00:25:35.094 --> 00:25:38.694
it can go on hurting others, it doesn't feel anything,

00:25:38.814 --> 00:25:42.254
and the superego which goes on receiving all the hurts

00:25:42.374 --> 00:25:45.974
and always complaining about it.

00:25:49.254 --> 00:25:52.614
So it is for you to realize

00:25:53.654 --> 00:25:56.934
that you are the one who is breaking

00:25:57.054 --> 00:26:00.694
the collectivity.

00:26:01.974 --> 00:26:04.294
First of all, we had horrible leaders here,

00:26:04.414 --> 00:26:07.214
that's how our collectivity was very poor

00:26:07.334 --> 00:26:12.094
but now we are getting soberer people, better people.

00:26:13.334 --> 00:26:16.574
Also for Melbourne I am thinking of getting

00:26:16.694 --> 00:26:19.894
somebody elderly for you to be the leader

00:26:20.014 --> 00:26:25.094
because I think Greg is full with responsibility.

00:26:25.214 --> 00:26:27.294
So, I thought of Henshaw

00:26:27.414 --> 00:26:30.054
and I asked him and he has agreed.

00:26:30.174 --> 00:26:32.654
So now in Melbourne we'll have somebody

00:26:32.774 --> 00:26:36.334
staying in the ashram, who is a retired man, who'll look after you,

00:26:36.454 --> 00:26:39.294
will do everything that is possible

00:26:39.414 --> 00:26:43.174
to look after the collectivity of Melbourne.

00:26:45.054 --> 00:26:48.574
But you have to know that

00:26:48.694 --> 00:26:51.814
I have one connection with you

00:26:51.934 --> 00:26:55.774
through your leader.

00:26:57.174 --> 00:26:59.774
That doesn't mean you cannot connect.

00:27:01.014 --> 00:27:03.134
Like supposing there's a pin

00:27:03.254 --> 00:27:05.934
and you put the pin to Me, immediately My hand will go off

00:27:06.054 --> 00:27:08.454
- means there's a reflex action also,

00:27:08.574 --> 00:27:11.054
but mostly everything is reported to the brain.

00:27:11.174 --> 00:27:15.294
In the same way, everything should be reported to the brain

00:27:15.414 --> 00:27:19.174
but from the very beginning if you develop a kind of

00:27:19.294 --> 00:27:22.934
a criticizing attitude towards your leader,

00:27:23.054 --> 00:27:26.414
then it becomes very difficult

00:27:26.534 --> 00:27:29.334
- for the leader as well as for you.

00:27:29.454 --> 00:27:31.574
First you should not criticize.

00:27:31.694 --> 00:27:33.974
Don't use your brain for criticism,

00:27:34.094 --> 00:27:38.494
already criticism has been too much in the West.

00:27:38.614 --> 00:27:42.654
I mean, now they have got now technique of criticizing.

00:27:43.374 --> 00:27:46.614
All the art is finished because of the critics.

00:27:46.734 --> 00:27:49.294
The artists are afraid to show their paintings,

00:27:49.414 --> 00:27:51.814
artists are afraid to show their creations

00:27:51.934 --> 00:27:53.694
because they will be criticized.

00:27:53.814 --> 00:27:57.934
Now the only thing that is left are critics, critics, critics,

00:27:58.054 --> 00:28:01.974
and the critics are criticizing critics, that's all.

00:28:02.894 --> 00:28:05.894
There is no creativity, nothing.

00:28:06.014 --> 00:28:08.574
So try to appreciate everything.

00:28:08.694 --> 00:28:12.534
Children are producing pictures, paintings anyway.

00:28:13.654 --> 00:28:17.334
They make sometimes My faces very funny

00:28:17.454 --> 00:28:20.294
when they draw - not the children, even grownups.

00:28:20.414 --> 00:28:22.054
Doesn't matter, I appreciate it,

00:28:22.174 --> 00:28:25.054
it's very good, wonderful, very nice,

00:28:25.174 --> 00:28:27.494
to encourage that person.

00:28:27.614 --> 00:28:30.454
So criticism should go out of our mind,

00:28:30.574 --> 00:28:34.014
but appreciation should be practiced:

00:28:35.534 --> 00:28:38.254
appreciation of others' children,

00:28:38.374 --> 00:28:42.934
appreciation of other people is very important

00:28:43.054 --> 00:28:46.414
but that doesn't mean that you appreciate all others

00:28:46.534 --> 00:28:50.294
and torture your wife or torture your husband

00:28:50.414 --> 00:28:52.814
- that also is an imbalance.

00:28:53.254 --> 00:28:56.054
First responsibility is your family

00:28:56.174 --> 00:28:59.134
but you should appreciate others,

00:28:59.254 --> 00:29:03.934
and this comes when you have no jealousies about anyone.

00:29:04.414 --> 00:29:06.774
This jealousy I don't know from where it comes,

00:29:06.894 --> 00:29:11.654
I don't know this quality of jealousy, why there is jealousy.

00:29:12.414 --> 00:29:15.454
So, also if you have jealousy you have to use it

00:29:15.574 --> 00:29:17.854
for the right purpose,

00:29:17.974 --> 00:29:19.574
and what is the right purpose

00:29:19.734 --> 00:29:21.894
is that you should be jealous of a person

00:29:22.014 --> 00:29:24.094
who is spiritually higher than you,

00:29:24.214 --> 00:29:27.574
and you practice it that you become better.

00:29:27.734 --> 00:29:29.854
If jealousy is for competition,

00:29:29.974 --> 00:29:32.094
then you compete with the person

00:29:32.214 --> 00:29:37.014
who is more compassionate, more loving,

00:29:37.134 --> 00:29:40.174
more sacrificing, more patient.

00:29:43.294 --> 00:29:46.854
So this competition becomes a very healthy competition

00:29:46.974 --> 00:29:50.774
and the collectivity becomes very nourished.

00:29:51.934 --> 00:29:56.694
Now try to feel that you are all
part and parcel of one personality.

00:29:58.694 --> 00:30:02.374
Try to understand this and practice this.

00:30:02.494 --> 00:30:05.254
This will help you a lot.

00:30:06.054 --> 00:30:10.774
Little things like buying a little present for someone.

00:30:11.494 --> 00:30:12.894
You see something, "Oh,

00:30:13.014 --> 00:30:16.374
this will be very nice for this person."

00:30:17.014 --> 00:30:19.174
We have officially decided

00:30:19.294 --> 00:30:21.414
that the men should not give presents to women

00:30:21.534 --> 00:30:24.254
and women should not give presents to men,

00:30:24.374 --> 00:30:27.534
but if she is your sister, rakhi sister you can give

00:30:27.654 --> 00:30:30.654
and the rakhi sister can give to the brother,

00:30:30.774 --> 00:30:32.574
but otherwise one should not do that.

00:30:32.694 --> 00:30:36.854
We have done it because I have seen it creates problems,

00:30:36.974 --> 00:30:39.694
but that doesn't mean you hate women or hate men.

00:30:39.814 --> 00:30:44.134
But a distance has to be maintained of purity

00:30:45.054 --> 00:30:47.294
till you become completely innocent

00:30:47.414 --> 00:30:50.694
is better is to keep that distance.

00:30:56.054 --> 00:30:58.974
This purity is to be practiced

00:31:00.974 --> 00:31:04.014
and this practice of purity is that

00:31:04.134 --> 00:31:10.174
you try to develop your innocent feelings towards others.

00:31:11.294 --> 00:31:14.214
In innocence everything comes,

00:31:14.854 --> 00:31:17.534
everything comes in innocence.

00:31:17.654 --> 00:31:19.854
If you are innocent

00:31:19.974 --> 00:31:23.894
you will immediately become

00:31:24.014 --> 00:31:26.614
a very good Sahaja Yogi

00:31:27.014 --> 00:31:29.414
but it has so many facets.

00:31:29.534 --> 00:31:32.734
Like the other day there was one girl she was fighting

00:31:32.854 --> 00:31:36.814
for getting some sort of a sweet,

00:31:38.174 --> 00:31:41.774
and they were distributing the prasads.

00:31:41.894 --> 00:31:44.694
So I gave her one of the small plates, I said, "You distribute."

00:31:44.814 --> 00:31:47.134
Immediately she forgot what she wanted,

00:31:47.254 --> 00:31:50.654
she started distributing very sweetly with little, little hands

00:31:50.774 --> 00:31:54.094
the prasad to everyone, very sweet.

00:31:55.654 --> 00:31:58.814
So this has to be practiced from childhood,

00:31:58.934 --> 00:32:01.414
with your children you have to tell them, "Alright,

00:32:01.534 --> 00:32:04.494
let's do these things, distribute this to people,

00:32:04.614 --> 00:32:06.974
go and put kumkum on their heads"

00:32:07.094 --> 00:32:09.334
- they may not do it well, but doesn't matter.

00:32:09.454 --> 00:32:11.654
They will learn how to meet others,

00:32:11.774 --> 00:32:15.214
how to talk to them, how to be with others.

00:32:15.494 --> 00:32:20.654
Now the worst enemy of collectivity is aggressiveness.

00:32:20.934 --> 00:32:23.534
Some people are basically aggressive;

00:32:23.654 --> 00:32:26.814
their style of talking is extremely aggressive.

00:32:26.934 --> 00:32:29.614
The way they say things is aggressive,

00:32:29.734 --> 00:32:34.494
maybe because anything, maybe they are better educated,

00:32:34.614 --> 00:32:38.574
maybe they come from a very aggressive family,

00:32:38.694 --> 00:32:43.934
maybe they are having a kind of a superiority complex

00:32:44.054 --> 00:32:47.894
or an inferiority complex or a sense of insecurity,

00:32:48.014 --> 00:32:51.014
or maybe they are possessed.

00:32:51.534 --> 00:32:55.574
They try to dominate and show their very strong

00:32:55.694 --> 00:33:02.574
feelings towards people of superiority.

00:33:03.134 --> 00:33:07.974
They may be inferior, it's not necessary, but they do

00:33:08.494 --> 00:33:11.214
and this is something is to be curbed.

00:33:11.694 --> 00:33:16.574
So what you have to practice here is humility:

00:33:16.694 --> 00:33:18.414
try to be humble.

00:33:20.054 --> 00:33:22.454
There was a joke like this, that

00:33:22.574 --> 00:33:25.814
one gentleman was going on the staircase

00:33:25.934 --> 00:33:29.094
and another was coming from the top.

00:33:32.094 --> 00:33:36.174
So this gentleman who was going up there

00:33:37.414 --> 00:33:40.414
said to the other that, "Please move."

00:33:40.534 --> 00:33:43.974
So he said, "l don't move for fools."

00:33:44.094 --> 00:33:46.414
The person who was climbing up, he said,

00:33:46.534 --> 00:33:50.174
"But I do" and he moved out.

00:33:52.254 --> 00:33:54.494
That's how the humility works.

00:33:54.654 --> 00:33:59.654
You have to be humble in your approach to others.

00:34:00.654 --> 00:34:04.294
I mean, English language is outwardly very humble,

00:34:04.414 --> 00:34:07.534
like you must say "please" you must say "thank you" ten times,

00:34:07.654 --> 00:34:10.894
please, please, please, thank you, thank you, thank you,

00:34:11.014 --> 00:34:12.894
but not in the heart.

00:34:13.014 --> 00:34:15.374
Like supposing somebody doesn't say thank you,

00:34:15.494 --> 00:34:17.254
the other person may even beat you.

00:34:17.334 --> 00:34:19.854
"Why didn't you say 'thank you' to me?"

00:34:21.374 --> 00:34:23.214
This is not humility.

00:34:23.854 --> 00:34:30.014
Humility is that in no way you try to aggress others,

00:34:30.134 --> 00:34:32.094
and if others are aggressive

00:34:32.214 --> 00:34:35.094
you accept it as a childish thing,

00:34:35.214 --> 00:34:39.894
as a stupid thing, as a foolish thing, it has no meaning:

00:34:40.014 --> 00:34:43.934
because you are so powerful, you can bear it.

00:34:44.894 --> 00:34:47.894
That is humility which you have to practice

00:34:48.014 --> 00:34:51.574
and all these qualities if you have,

00:34:54.174 --> 00:34:56.614
you will really be surprised

00:34:56.734 --> 00:34:59.494
that you will lose your selfishness.

00:34:59.614 --> 00:35:02.014
Your selfishness will start dropping out

00:35:02.134 --> 00:35:07.414
because selfishness how ugly it is

00:35:07.694 --> 00:35:09.694
you start realizing very soon

00:35:10.334 --> 00:35:13.174
when you become generous.

00:35:13.294 --> 00:35:16.734
So you practice your generosity.

00:35:16.934 --> 00:35:19.694
You are all willing to spend lot of money on Me, I know.

00:35:19.814 --> 00:35:22.054
You want to give Me presents - I've stopped it now -

00:35:22.174 --> 00:35:25.134
that individually you cannot give Me any presents or anything,

00:35:25.254 --> 00:35:28.414
but generosity is a general term:

00:35:28.534 --> 00:35:31.534
generosity of kindness,

00:35:31.654 --> 00:35:34.414
generosity of compassion,

00:35:34.534 --> 00:35:37.134
generosity of patience,

00:35:37.254 --> 00:35:40.934
and generosity of material things.

00:35:42.534 --> 00:35:45.054
If I see something, immediately I think,

00:35:45.174 --> 00:35:47.974
"Oh, I should take this because I know l can give it

00:35:48.094 --> 00:35:50.214
to this lady or to this gentleman this thing,

00:35:50.334 --> 00:35:52.694
or I could give it to this purpose

00:35:52.814 --> 00:35:54.374
or for this organization

00:35:54.494 --> 00:35:56.974
or for this kind of a work we are doing."

00:35:57.094 --> 00:35:58.734
Immediately it comes to Me.

00:35:58.854 --> 00:36:03.094
You'd be surprised that if I'm in the market

00:36:03.214 --> 00:36:06.014
and if I'm thirsty, I don't even think

00:36:06.134 --> 00:36:10.734
that I should go and buy some soft drink for Myself

00:36:10.854 --> 00:36:13.094
- doesn't come into mind.

00:36:13.494 --> 00:36:17.694
Even I have never opened My 'fridge in My lifetime,

00:36:17.814 --> 00:36:21.494
but for others I'll run about, I'll cook for them,

00:36:21.614 --> 00:36:24.894
but supposing I'm in the house and there's no cook,

00:36:25.014 --> 00:36:29.534
I'll not cook for Myself - it's all right. If there's nobody in the house,

00:36:29.654 --> 00:36:32.254
if My husband is not there, I will not eat for two/three days

00:36:32.374 --> 00:36:35.214
and then servants, servant will complain to My husband

00:36:35.334 --> 00:36:38.574
then I remember, really, I didn't eat any food? I didn't know.

00:36:38.694 --> 00:36:41.094
If I am eating I am just eating because he is there,

00:36:41.214 --> 00:36:42.894
so I have to eat with him.

00:36:43.454 --> 00:36:45.214
I never used to take tea

00:36:45.334 --> 00:36:48.294
but because he is so much fond of tea,

00:36:48.414 --> 00:36:50.614
I started, so I keep the practice

00:36:50.734 --> 00:36:53.214
so that I should not give it the practice up.

00:36:53.334 --> 00:36:55.814
Later on it will be difficult

00:36:55.934 --> 00:36:58.774
it just adjusting yourself to others,

00:36:58.894 --> 00:37:00.694
it's not difficult.

00:37:00.814 --> 00:37:05.494
Few things here and there that pleases, you should.

00:37:05.614 --> 00:37:07.734
There's no harm in trying to please.

00:37:07.854 --> 00:37:09.534
It's not only for the wife to do it,

00:37:09.654 --> 00:37:13.214
even the husband has to do something to please the wife

00:37:13.334 --> 00:37:15.214
- it's not only between husband and wife,

00:37:15.334 --> 00:37:17.014
it will be between children and you,

00:37:17.134 --> 00:37:19.174
between the whole family of Sahaja Yoga,

00:37:19.294 --> 00:37:23.254
it should be such that we should adjust.

00:37:23.374 --> 00:37:25.774
So practice your adjustments

00:37:25.894 --> 00:37:27.734
as you have to adjust your cameras.

00:37:27.854 --> 00:37:29.854
If you don't adjust the camera,

00:37:29.974 --> 00:37:32.334
you do not get the right picture. In the same way,

00:37:32.454 --> 00:37:34.774
unless and until you adjust yourself

00:37:34.894 --> 00:37:38.054
to the whole atmosphere, to a person,

00:37:38.174 --> 00:37:40.614
you cannot get the real picture,

00:37:40.854 --> 00:37:44.734
and then you start fighting with that.

00:37:44.854 --> 00:37:49.214
It is actually the fight has to be within yourself.

00:37:49.334 --> 00:37:51.214
It's quite a long, long story, I mean,

00:37:51.334 --> 00:37:53.134
as far as I know human beings

00:37:53.254 --> 00:37:58.014
and the problems of collectivity,

00:37:58.934 --> 00:38:01.694
and certain problems are being solved now,

00:38:01.814 --> 00:38:05.734
I am happy about it, that people are not falling in love,

00:38:05.854 --> 00:38:09.054
I mean they are not falling and having a bump on their heads.

00:38:09.174 --> 00:38:13.134
But it's better now, they are taking it easy,

00:38:13.254 --> 00:38:16.974
thinking it over and are marrying a person

00:38:17.094 --> 00:38:21.294
for marriage sake and not for falling in love.

00:38:21.414 --> 00:38:23.294
There is something very great is happening

00:38:23.414 --> 00:38:26.334
because that would give you purification of mind

00:38:26.494 --> 00:38:29.174
and a mind which doesn't

00:38:29.254 --> 00:38:32.614
hover over nonsensical things.

00:38:34.174 --> 00:38:38.014
So as I said, practice all these things

00:38:38.134 --> 00:38:41.814
and your collectivity will be beautiful,

00:38:42.814 --> 00:38:47.214
and the best is to practice your meditation together.

00:38:47.334 --> 00:38:50.134
In Delhi we have started an ashram,

00:38:50.254 --> 00:38:52.774
every morning I find people coming,

00:38:52.894 --> 00:38:54.374
sitting together to meditate,

00:38:54.494 --> 00:38:56.854
it's like a temple, it's like a church.

00:38:56.974 --> 00:38:59.334
They come there and so many of them

00:38:59.454 --> 00:39:02.814
are sitting and meditating together.

00:39:03.454 --> 00:39:08.974
Meditating together is the best way to feel the collectivity.

00:39:10.174 --> 00:39:13.614
You can meditate at home, of course, you also cleanse it for your depth,

00:39:13.734 --> 00:39:15.814
but also you must meditate together

00:39:15.934 --> 00:39:17.654
and when you meditate together

00:39:17.774 --> 00:39:21.654
then the strength that you have

00:39:21.774 --> 00:39:23.294
strengthens others,

00:39:23.414 --> 00:39:27.814
and the strength of the whole collectivity improves so much.

00:39:27.894 --> 00:39:31.254
You are meditating together is a very big thing.

00:39:31.494 --> 00:39:35.334
Everyone has to understand that whenever you get time

00:39:35.494 --> 00:39:37.774
you find out in the morning times, for example,

00:39:37.894 --> 00:39:40.574
we'll go to the ashram and meditate.

00:39:40.694 --> 00:39:44.094
Say, Sunday morning, we'll just go and meditate in the ashram.

00:39:44.214 --> 00:39:46.054
Just for meditation you have to come.

00:39:46.174 --> 00:39:47.854
Meditate and go away

00:39:47.974 --> 00:39:50.534
because I reside in this ashram,

00:39:50.654 --> 00:39:53.174
I am here, so leave your homes,

00:39:53.294 --> 00:39:55.614
come here and meditate.

00:39:55.734 --> 00:39:57.894
Meditation will help you a lot.

00:39:58.014 --> 00:40:01.494
Wherever you are together, I am with you

00:40:01.614 --> 00:40:06.454
but when you are away from each other, I am not with you.

00:40:07.054 --> 00:40:10.814
Only in difficulties, when you are pushed into some places

00:40:10.934 --> 00:40:15.734
where I am not there, where you think I am not there, I am there.

00:40:15.814 --> 00:40:17.214
But

00:40:17.374 --> 00:40:20.734
if you deliberately are keeping out of collectivity,

00:40:20.854 --> 00:40:22.254
I am not with you,

00:40:22.374 --> 00:40:24.294
so try to grow your collectivity

00:40:24.414 --> 00:40:29.614
otherwise you cannot go deep into your own depths,

00:40:29.734 --> 00:40:31.534
you cannot become a great Sahaja Yogi,

00:40:31.654 --> 00:40:35.734
you cannot really be called a Sahaja Yogi.

00:40:36.014 --> 00:40:40.934
Those who have a sense of collectivity can only become that.

00:40:42.014 --> 00:40:46.374
So we have before us in Melbourne so many people

00:40:46.494 --> 00:40:50.454
and when the quantity increases, the quality should not fall down

00:40:50.574 --> 00:40:58.814
and the quality of collectivity has to be very strong

00:40:58.934 --> 00:41:01.494
by having very strong bonds.

00:41:01.574 --> 00:41:03.974
I like when you praise someone.

00:41:04.094 --> 00:41:06.654
Normally I have seen whenever I am anywhere,

00:41:06.774 --> 00:41:08.854
people only talk about people who are negative,

00:41:08.974 --> 00:41:10.774
nobody talks about positive people,

00:41:10.894 --> 00:41:14.334
so I don't know about them, mostly I know who are negative.

00:41:14.454 --> 00:41:17.614
So I would love to know about people who are very positive,

00:41:17.734 --> 00:41:20.614
who are great, who are doing good things

00:41:20.734 --> 00:41:24.374
and forget about the negative - they'll drop out anyway.

00:41:24.494 --> 00:41:29.214
So best thing is to tell about the people who are positive,

00:41:29.334 --> 00:41:32.494
who are doing good work,

00:41:32.614 --> 00:41:36.294
who are real Sahaja Yogis.

00:41:36.934 --> 00:41:39.334
I bless you all in Melbourne

00:41:39.454 --> 00:41:41.974
that you have a beautiful collectivity

00:41:42.094 --> 00:41:45.454
and enjoy yourself and every, every meeting

00:41:45.574 --> 00:41:48.854
should be a festival for you and an enjoyment.

00:41:48.974 --> 00:41:51.134
May God bless you!

00:41:56.814 --> 00:42:00.574
So thus today we have to worship Virata.

00:42:00.694 --> 00:42:02.254
He is nothing but Akbar

00:42:02.374 --> 00:42:06.774
who is Shri Krishna Himself becoming Virata.
