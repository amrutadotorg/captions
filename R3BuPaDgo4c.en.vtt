00:00:06.796 --> 00:00:12.866
I was not very much interested in the studies
but I used to do very well but I used to read

00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:18.908
lives of great men and things like that.
At a very young age, I read Bernard Shaw.

00:00:19.568 --> 00:00:24.168
When people were reading just 'Great
Expectations', I was reading Bernard Shaw.

00:00:24.694 --> 00:00:29.464
But as such, I didn't have interest in
particularly reading some text books

00:00:29.464 --> 00:00:34.082
because I thought, they were childish and
there's nothing to be read about it.

00:00:34.471 --> 00:00:38.091
Then, I told My father that, "I have
to do Medicine." So, he said, "Why?"

00:00:38.091 --> 00:00:40.321
I said, "Because I have to talk to
doctors."

00:00:40.461 --> 00:00:45.945
He said, "You have to talk to doctors?"
"Yes," I said, but it so happened in My

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:51.556
childhood, when I was about 7 years of
age - My father was a Congressman. He had

00:00:51.556 --> 00:00:56.288
joined Congress when I was 4 years of 
age; He used to live with a style, very

00:00:56.288 --> 00:01:01.225
Westernized. His clothes were stitched in
London, sort of a man - we had governesses

00:01:01.225 --> 00:01:06.836
and all that - he threw away everything
and he became a real Indian and started

00:01:06.836 --> 00:01:16.893
leading a life of a martyr. Then, he made
us study our languages Sanskrit. He made

00:01:16.893 --> 00:01:21.445
Me study in an Indian school - not in a
missionary school - because missionaries

00:01:21.445 --> 00:01:26.096
were very unkind. They threw us out of the
school when My father was in the Congress

00:01:26.096 --> 00:01:31.743
- they were against us completely.
Then, at the age of 7 years I

00:01:31.948 --> 00:01:40.418
happened to go with My father to Mahatma
Gandhi. He was about 70 miles living with

00:01:40.418 --> 00:01:44.788
us but the first time he took Me down and
Mahatma Gandhi liked Me very much.

00:01:44.788 --> 00:01:49.548
He said, "Leave this child with me." So,
I had not even taken clothes or anything,

00:01:49.548 --> 00:01:57.433
I stayed on, then My father sent Me everything,
with him and he was very fond of Me but I

00:01:57.433 --> 00:02:02.175
was a little girl but he understood that
there was something about Me. He consulted

00:02:02.175 --> 00:02:09.466
Me on very serious problems sometimes,
surprisingly. Like, one day he wanted to

00:02:09.466 --> 00:02:15.593
make the Prayer Book alright, so he asked
Me, "How should I put the series and all that."

00:02:15.882 --> 00:02:22.362
So, I told Me how to put the series and he
put the series in that way. I used to go

00:02:22.362 --> 00:02:29.213
back for My school and again go back to
Gandhiji every year, like that and he

00:02:29.213 --> 00:02:34.398
called Me Nepali - he gave Me a name Nepali.
Everybody used to call Me Nepali that time.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:42.830
Then I grew up with him very intimately; He
was a very, very kind person for children

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.908
otherwise an extremely strict man with
himself and with others, very strict - a big

00:02:47.908 --> 00:02:54.307
disciplinarian - and he would make everybody
get up at 4 0'clock, have your baths, everything,

00:02:54.307 --> 00:02:59.526
be ready for your morning prayers at 5 0'clock,
you see and he used to walk very fast;

00:02:59.526 --> 00:03:05.272
I also learnt walking fast with him. In
his company you had to walk fast and very

00:03:05.272 --> 00:03:10.124
extremely loving and a very nice person
and he would listen to Me because I was

00:03:10.124 --> 00:03:14.208
a child, you see. Supposing, I forced him
to eat more or something, then he wouldn't

00:03:14.208 --> 00:03:19.762
laugh, he would accept - very, kindly
person but with others he was very strict

00:03:19.762 --> 00:03:25.031
and I used to tell him that, "Why are you
strict with everyone?" He said, "But you

00:03:25.031 --> 00:03:28.124
are a little girl, You get up in the
morning time, why can't they get up?"

00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:31.517
I said, "I'm little that's why I get up,
they're big so they can't get up,"

00:03:31.517 --> 00:03:37.837
like that, you see, little chats and then
My father went to jail and My mother also

00:03:37.837 --> 00:03:43.263
went to jail five times. My father went to jail
twice - once for about two and a half years and

00:03:43.271 --> 00:03:49.181
he was the only supporting member of the
family. By the way, we come from a very old

00:03:49.181 --> 00:03:56.955
royal family, which is called as Shalivahanas;
They have a calendar also in India and then

00:03:56.955 --> 00:04:04.599
when we, I mean, when they took My father
to jail, we had to leave our house and we

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:10.323
had to live in huts and in all problems
- that was nothing - but also Me, they

00:04:10.323 --> 00:04:15.212
pestered a lot because I helped many people
there and I joined the '42 movement in a very

00:04:15.212 --> 00:04:19.204
serious way and I became the leader here for
the young people. I thought unless and until

00:04:19.204 --> 00:04:27.372
I take a very positive stand, it may not
work out with them. It's not gracious to say

00:04:27.372 --> 00:04:32.670
how they tortured Me, what they did to Me
but they really tortured Me; I was a young

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:39.710
girl of 19 years that time. It's over now,
so it's finished and after that we

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:47.974
My father went to jail again and then when he
came back, he got elected as the Member of the

00:04:47.974 --> 00:04:54.844
Central Assembly, later on, as the Constituent
Assembly and then of the Parliament. My brother

00:04:54.844 --> 00:05:01.310
was also a Member of the Parliament later
on. Now recently, he was the Minister

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:09.008
in the cabinet. Another brother is a High
Court judge in Bombay. They're all doing

00:05:09.008 --> 00:05:14.014
well despite the fact that our parents
neglected us, in a way, because they gave

00:05:14.014 --> 00:05:19.109
their lives for the country but, you see,
that never deter us from studies and

00:05:19.109 --> 00:05:24.672
we came up very well. Then I, when I was
in '42 movement, you see, My college

00:05:24.672 --> 00:05:30.517
rusticated Me. From the college they threw
Me out and I had to go to another college

00:05:30.517 --> 00:05:39.705
to study far away from My house, in Punjab,
where I studied for two years, Science I did,

00:05:39.705 --> 00:05:47.483
then I did My Medical. I didn't do fully
because just after that the '47 riots

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.850
broke out, so our college was closed and
I didn't want to know more because what I

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:56.899
wanted to know, I came to know about it,
so I did not need and I got married.

00:05:58.392 --> 00:06:04.162
You must have heard, My husband is now the
Secretary General of the International Maritime Organization.

00:06:04.242 --> 00:06:11.082
He held a very high positions. He was also
Secretary to Lal Bahadur Shastri, who was

00:06:11.082 --> 00:06:15.438
our Prime Minister, who was another very
great man but he did not survive long.

00:06:15.438 --> 00:06:19.534
If he had survived, things would have
been different, I think for our country

00:06:19.534 --> 00:06:26.987
because he was a Gandhian, out and out
Gandhian and he lived like an ideal
Gandhian personality.
