1
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:10,801
And Sahaja Yoga is the place where you have to learn,

2
00:00:10,881 --> 00:00:17,173
in every way. For Indians have to learn how to be honest

3
00:00:20,173 --> 00:00:23,572
and English have to learn how to love.

4
00:00:23,652 --> 00:00:28,363
Americans have to learn how to be self-respecting.

5
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:34,520
All of us have to learn, give up what we had, our identifications,

6
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,739
and have to become subtler and universal

7
00:00:38,819 --> 00:00:43,872
and people of such values that anybody who sees will say

8
00:00:43,952 --> 00:00:49,775
that in America Mother has created Abraham Lincolns,

9
00:00:51,152 --> 00:00:56,757
in Russia Tolstoys, in Maharashtra Shivajis.

10
00:00:59,297 --> 00:01:03,265
I’m too ambitious, I should say,

11
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:09,153
but I see reality in you and reality in Myself.

12
00:01:09,233 --> 00:01:13,476
On that basis, I say, one has to create

13
00:01:13,556 --> 00:01:18,236
people of that special quality which they have sterling qualities,

14
00:01:18,316 --> 00:01:23,000
sterling qualities, spiritual qualities

15
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,935
which are so subtle, so beautiful,

16
00:01:27,015 --> 00:01:29,876
so sweet, so understanding.

17
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:32,727
And still, just like steel,

18
00:01:32,807 --> 00:01:40,720
nobody can budge them from their own principles, tatwas.

19
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:46,987
That is what it is, so simple as that.

20
00:01:47,067 --> 00:01:51,426
And then you start enjoying your love, enjoying your virtues,

21
00:01:51,506 --> 00:01:57,406
enjoying everything and having compassion for others.

22
00:01:57,486 --> 00:01:59,516
Then you don’t catch;

23
00:01:59,596 --> 00:02:03,878
you catch because you don’t have compassion.

24
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:07,091
In compassion you’ll never catch, never.

25
00:02:07,171 --> 00:02:09,491
A mother never gets a disease from her child.

26
00:02:09,571 --> 00:02:14,638
She never gets a disease from her child, it’s a fact.

27
00:02:17,673 --> 00:02:22,931
Child may be a tuberculosis patient or could be any patient,

28
00:02:23,011 --> 00:02:30,527
she never catches because she loves.

29
00:02:32,014 --> 00:02:35,769
In the same way, when you really love,

30
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:37,250
you’ll never catch anything.

31
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,591
Then what is the question of what is to clear,

32
00:02:39,671 --> 00:02:42,201
where to clear, what to do – what does it matter?

33
00:02:42,281 --> 00:02:44,241
You are just flowing your heart.

34
00:02:44,321 --> 00:02:47,866
At this moment, My children, My Sahaja yogis

35
00:02:47,946 --> 00:02:53,708
are at that level that they can completely open their heart

36
00:02:53,788 --> 00:02:58,144
without any fear.

37
00:03:00,409 --> 00:03:02,499
It’s a very different stage you have reached now;

38
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:06,295
you are at a different stage. Just assume your powers.

39
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:13,544
Know that you are that. Just open your heart.

40
00:03:13,624 --> 00:03:17,136
Like, the other day I saw somebody, he was caught up very badly

41
00:03:17,216 --> 00:03:19,577
from all the sides – not Sahaja yogi, somebody else.

42
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:20,758
And I asked him,

43
00:03:20,838 --> 00:03:25,158
“How did you manage to get so many bhoots into yourself?”

44
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:28,364
Every, every guru you name, he is there.

45
00:03:28,444 --> 00:03:29,850
I said, “How did you manage?”

46
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:34,227
He said, “I have a very open heart.”

47
00:03:34,895 --> 00:03:37,425
“Oh God,” I said.

48
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:42,810
I said, “It’s like an open window in a dirty place.

49
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:49,429
You get every smell, every mosquitoes and bugs walking into it.”

50
00:03:54,907 --> 00:03:59,179
So, the fear of opening your heart to that extent,

51
00:03:59,259 --> 00:04:02,944
comes from that, from that experience.

52
00:04:03,024 --> 00:04:09,594
But now, you are at such a stage that, open your heart.

53
00:04:11,162 --> 00:04:16,412
There should be no fear; there will be no problem,

54
00:04:16,492 --> 00:04:21,139
material problems are not difficult to be solved.

55
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:27,191
Like, somebody was taking My photograph

56
00:04:27,271 --> 00:04:30,165
which was in a silver frame,

57
00:04:30,245 --> 00:04:33,160
and she was rather worried because the customs may stop her

58
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,782
not taking. Of course, photograph they can’t stop,

59
00:04:36,862 --> 00:04:41,588
but maybe the silver frame.

60
00:04:41,668 --> 00:04:48,522
And this gentleman told Me that he was taking it

61
00:04:48,602 --> 00:04:52,570
with him with a frame, silver frame and he thought people will object.

62
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,900
But as soon as they saw the photograph

63
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:59,613
they said namaskar to the photograph, forgot about the frame.

64
00:05:06,728 --> 00:05:09,919
So many problems can be solved,

65
00:05:09,999 --> 00:05:17,359
material problems – is so simple to be solved, so simple.

66
00:05:19,407 --> 00:05:24,350
Is the easiest to be solved, physical problems also.

67
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,884
I have known of some Sahaja yogis

68
00:05:26,964 --> 00:05:29,427
who have been in Sahaja Yoga six, seven years.

69
00:05:29,507 --> 00:05:31,787
But still they are frightened about their body,

70
00:05:31,867 --> 00:05:35,353
their physical body, the troubles they have had

71
00:05:35,433 --> 00:05:38,740
and this and that. If they can just leave that fear,

72
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,574
they’ll get out of it.

73
00:05:40,654 --> 00:05:44,014
It is such a vicious circle built in.

74
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:47,430
And the same thing works out with our open heart

75
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,474
surgery as we call it.

76
00:05:49,554 --> 00:05:52,574
We are afraid that our heart will be again

77
00:05:52,654 --> 00:05:54,446
caught up into nonsensical things,

78
00:05:54,526 --> 00:05:57,156
so we don’t want to open our heart.

79
00:05:57,236 --> 00:05:58,957
That fear I can understand.

80
00:05:59,037 --> 00:06:02,774
But now you are Sahaja yogis, finished.

81
00:06:03,115 --> 00:06:07,619
Ask all these people to get lost.

82
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:13,192
All these fears, you should ask them to get lost.

83
00:06:15,651 --> 00:06:20,801
When you discover that you are the Spirit,

84
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:25,816
you are that powerful Spirit, just try to steady.

85
00:06:25,896 --> 00:06:30,943
How it feels happy. It’s very simple.

86
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:34,965
When do you feel really happy? Is when you give something,

87
00:06:35,045 --> 00:06:38,337
not to Mataji only. To Me you are, I know.

88
00:06:38,417 --> 00:06:43,552
If I take something from you, you will feel very happy about it,

89
00:06:43,632 --> 00:06:50,856
I know. But to somebody else; give some love, comfort.

90
00:06:50,936 --> 00:07:00,255
What a great power this voice and this vani has,

91
00:07:00,335 --> 00:07:06,227
that you can comfort others by saying good things.

92
00:07:06,307 --> 00:07:09,654
Can you imagine what a power God has given you?

93
00:07:09,734 --> 00:07:15,258
Without spending a single pi, you can comfort others,

94
00:07:15,338 --> 00:07:19,212
only by saying good things. If you say a vmantra,

95
00:07:19,292 --> 00:07:22,220
you’ll comfort them more in a subtle way.

96
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:29,968
If you instill love of God within them, it is even greater.

97
00:07:30,048 --> 00:07:40,375
And the joy of that is so much because the Spirit is joy.

98
00:07:40,455 --> 00:07:44,674
The more you open it out, the more light comes in,

99
00:07:44,754 --> 00:07:51,305
more it works out. So give up that fear

100
00:07:51,385 --> 00:07:55,011
which is placed within you in your experiences.

101
00:07:55,091 --> 00:07:58,905
Now, this is a new experience of a new life,

102
00:07:58,985 --> 00:08:04,168
where your energy comes from the Spirit, which is love.

103
00:08:04,248 --> 00:08:06,320
In one word it is love.

104
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:14,817
And in three words, it is truth, it is attention and it is joy.

105
00:08:14,897 --> 00:08:17,607
All put together it is love.

106
00:08:17,687 --> 00:08:23,579
When you mix them up, it becomes love.

107
00:08:23,659 --> 00:08:29,165
And that is what you have – it’s the great power of love.

108
00:08:29,245 --> 00:08:31,933
Through your attention you love others,

109
00:08:32,013 --> 00:08:35,198
even attention is sufficient.

110
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:38,654
To be attentive…. see, I needed a handkerchief

111
00:08:38,734 --> 00:08:44,123
All right, that’s true. I needed a handkerchief. I forgot.

112
00:08:44,203 --> 00:08:47,823
I mean, usually I forget all these things.

113
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:53,766
Then they felt the need, “Mother needs just a handkerchief.”

114
00:08:53,846 --> 00:08:56,032
They brought the handkerchief;

115
00:08:56,112 --> 00:09:05,564
a very simple action, you know, but the attention is on Me.

116
00:09:05,644 --> 00:09:11,500
With little things like handkerchief you can comfort people.

117
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,374
For a Sahaja yogi, even to give a handkerchief itself

118
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:18,294
is so vibrated, itself.

119
00:09:18,374 --> 00:09:22,763
To win over other people is also this way:

120
00:09:22,843 --> 00:09:28,283
to be kind to them, to give them.

121
00:09:28,363 --> 00:09:33,563
But to give them realization is the highest thing.

122
00:09:36,156 --> 00:09:38,808
Now, when you become subtler and subtler,

123
00:09:38,888 --> 00:09:43,995
you will see that you will not have sympathies with people

124
00:09:44,075 --> 00:09:47,157
who are afflicted, not sympathies,

125
00:09:47,237 --> 00:09:51,487
but you will have love for them.

126
00:09:51,567 --> 00:09:57,168
There is a big difference between sympathy and love.

127
00:09:57,248 --> 00:10:02,698
When you have sympathy means what? You share pathos.

128
00:10:02,778 --> 00:10:06,400
Pathos. If you want to share pathos, share.

129
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,913
Very good idea is to share pathos.

130
00:10:10,993 --> 00:10:17,260
But if you want to share joy,

131
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:20,861
you will not have sympathy, you’ll have love.

132
00:10:20,941 --> 00:10:24,894
You want to share your joy of your Spirit with another person,

133
00:10:24,974 --> 00:10:27,782
so you may talk to that person in a way

134
00:10:27,862 --> 00:10:32,111
that may not look so much pleasing and falling at his feet,

135
00:10:32,191 --> 00:10:33,993
and – you see, this is the work of politicians

136
00:10:34,073 --> 00:10:37,482
or business people, not yours.

137
00:10:37,722 --> 00:10:39,868
You are not seeking any business out of them;

138
00:10:39,948 --> 00:10:43,169
you want them to come to realization.

139
00:10:43,249 --> 00:10:51,398
So, you have to say things which are wrong very firmly.

140
00:10:51,478 --> 00:10:53,788
With a real firm hand you have to say,

141
00:10:53,868 --> 00:10:57,375
“This is absolutely wrong, absurd.”

142
00:10:57,455 --> 00:10:59,228
You have to convince on that point,

143
00:10:59,308 --> 00:11:01,934
on that if you go on saying, like this, like that,

144
00:11:02,014 --> 00:11:03,717
it will never go into their heads because they are bhoots

145
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:09,974
and you have to hit them hard. That is also love.

146
00:11:10,054 --> 00:11:18,755
So, love is the strongest thing and the sweetest thing.

147
00:11:18,835 --> 00:11:22,084
Is such a beautiful combination

148
00:11:22,164 --> 00:11:26,462
and the one who has the wisdom, that subtler wisdom,

149
00:11:26,542 --> 00:11:30,857
can only achieve it. Now again the mind will work,

150
00:11:30,937 --> 00:11:33,000
“How to do it?”

151
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:40,361
So, I think all of you should put this word “how” into the sea.

152
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:46,547
There is another very good word in English language,

153
00:11:46,627 --> 00:11:48,980
which you should use: “why not!”

154
00:11:56,190 --> 00:12:02,421
That’s the way you can assure yourself, ascertain yourself,

155
00:12:02,501 --> 00:12:10,084
work it out that way into complete blessing of God.

156
00:12:10,164 --> 00:12:13,532
You have to just pass those blessings to others,

157
00:12:13,612 --> 00:12:18,217
that’s all. Nothing more is to be done,

158
00:12:18,297 --> 00:12:22,304
just pass that light to others.

159
00:12:22,384 --> 00:12:25,092
For that, what you need

160
00:12:25,172 --> 00:12:33,258
is a man who has accepted love as his career,

161
00:12:33,338 --> 00:12:36,396
a man who worships love,

162
00:12:36,476 --> 00:12:43,178
a person who thinks love is above all.
