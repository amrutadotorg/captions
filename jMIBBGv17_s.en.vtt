00:05:08.386 --> 00:05:12.886
It was very spontaneously decided

00:05:13.046 --> 00:05:22.846
that we should have the Devi Puja in England.

00:05:27.678 --> 00:05:32.120
And this is the place where really Devi Puja should be,

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.759
because it’s the place of Sadashiva

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:39.759
and where Adi Shakti should be worshipped.

00:05:51.031 --> 00:05:56.551
We have to today understand

00:05:57.047 --> 00:06:01.367
that why do we do Devi Puja?

00:06:02.592 --> 00:06:09.432
What is the reason for this Devi Puja?

00:06:10.063 --> 00:06:12.982
What do we get out of it?

00:06:13.142 --> 00:06:18.777
What are we supposed to achieve in our contents

00:06:18.937 --> 00:06:22.091
within ourselves?

00:06:25.049 --> 00:06:31.969
The first thing is that Kundalini is the Devi.

00:06:32.679 --> 00:06:36.199
She’s the reflection of the Adi Shakti.

00:06:37.672 --> 00:06:40.859
So when you worship Devi,

00:06:41.019 --> 00:06:45.261
first you worship also your own Kundalini

00:06:45.421 --> 00:06:52.426
by giving Her credit because She has given you this realization.

00:06:53.191 --> 00:06:55.960
It’s much deeper understanding

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.889
than normally people have about the Devi Puja

00:07:00.049 --> 00:07:03.470
because they are not realized souls.

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:06.121
Their Kundalini not is awakened.

00:07:06.281 --> 00:07:09.632
So normally when they do Devi Puja it’s for the purpose

00:07:09.792 --> 00:07:11.608
of getting realization

00:07:11.768 --> 00:07:14.247
so that the Devi should be pleased

00:07:14.407 --> 00:07:17.969
– prasanna – and should give them realization,

00:07:18.129 --> 00:07:21.379
or must get our chance to get to somebody

00:07:21.539 --> 00:07:25.087
who will give them realization.

00:07:26.662 --> 00:07:29.576
But you are at a different level now.

00:07:29.736 --> 00:07:34.166
So it’s more of a thanksgiving to your own Kundalini

00:07:34.326 --> 00:07:36.592
and to Adi Shakti,

00:07:36.752 --> 00:07:43.421
glorifying that whatever has happened so miraculously

00:07:43.581 --> 00:07:47.104
is because of the Kundalini which was within you,

00:07:47.264 --> 00:07:53.256
which was reflected by the Adi Shakti.

00:07:55.103 --> 00:07:59.468
But one has to know that

00:07:59.844 --> 00:08:08.103
only we are realized souls is not the point,

00:08:08.263 --> 00:08:13.143
only that we can feel the vibrations is not the point,

00:08:14.543 --> 00:08:20.064
that we can give realizations to other is also not the point.

00:08:22.696 --> 00:08:26.872
Then what is it? Very important –

00:08:27.032 --> 00:08:30.833
it’s the content within us.

00:08:31.172 --> 00:08:35.776
What do we have within us is the point.

00:08:35.936 --> 00:08:39.529
These are all the expressions of what we have within.

00:08:39.689 --> 00:08:43.511
Supposing somebody is generous,

00:08:43.671 --> 00:08:48.992
then know that he’s a rich man, otherwise he cannot be.

00:08:49.152 --> 00:08:54.432
So the content within us, we have to see.

00:08:55.406 --> 00:08:59.756
And when we start seeing the content,

00:09:04.432 --> 00:09:09.138
where do we find in the nature there is real content?

00:09:09.298 --> 00:09:16.363
We see the sea; sea is there you see, full of water.

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:22.426
So much of water it sucks in from everywhere,

00:09:22.586 --> 00:09:28.161
and then it allows itself to be boiled by the sun

00:09:28.321 --> 00:09:31.505
and gives rain.

00:09:35.256 --> 00:09:39.713
But sea is the lowest level,

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:41.914
stands at the lowest level

00:09:42.074 --> 00:09:46.415
and sucks in all the water from everywhere.

00:09:48.112 --> 00:09:52.649
In the same way a Sahaja yogi must know that

00:09:52.809 --> 00:09:59.161
to be really achieving more content,

00:09:59.321 --> 00:10:09.081
we have to be not at a higher level outside.

00:10:11.257 --> 00:10:13.913
It’s said in the Bible, “You have to be meek,”

00:10:14.073 --> 00:10:17.064
but I think it was not explained to people.

00:10:17.224 --> 00:10:22.338
Only the strong people can be meek,

00:10:22.498 --> 00:10:25.585
secured people can be meek,

00:10:25.745 --> 00:10:31.296
only the rich in essence can be meek,

00:10:31.456 --> 00:10:37.923
not the people who are insecured.

00:10:38.083 --> 00:10:42.663
Because they are insecured, how can they be meek?

00:10:44.872 --> 00:10:50.480
And not the people whom we think are rich, so-called,

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:54.626
because if they are rich they are not generous,

00:10:54.786 --> 00:10:59.377
they are not satisfied, they are not philanthropic,

00:10:59.537 --> 00:11:04.719
so they are not rich. They are still greedy beggars.

00:11:07.408 --> 00:11:13.201
So the content within us is to be seen. What is our content?

00:11:16.288 --> 00:11:21.317
You love Me, I love you – it’s very good.

00:11:23.983 --> 00:11:29.183
But when you love Me,

00:11:29.807 --> 00:11:34.240
you have to know that there are certain qualities

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:38.440
which are very lovable in a Sahaja yogi.

00:11:39.952 --> 00:11:44.768
Actually people get lost even after Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:44.928 --> 00:11:47.768
They think they can get over everything,

00:11:47.928 --> 00:11:50.248
they’re perfectly all right,

00:11:50.408 --> 00:11:54.364
and they are thrown overboard.

00:11:58.561 --> 00:12:01.127
So when we say that we have to be meek,

00:12:01.287 --> 00:12:06.650
this is a content, the humility is a content.

00:12:07.062 --> 00:12:11.902
So try to that, try to be humble with someone.

00:12:12.062 --> 00:12:15.302
You’ll like yourself.

00:12:17.942 --> 00:12:21.606
You’ll enjoy that quality within this that,

00:12:21.766 --> 00:12:26.013
“You see, I’m humbler than another person.”

00:12:26.989 --> 00:12:31.392
And what is another thing we find has content

00:12:31.646 --> 00:12:35.095
are the great mountains,

00:12:35.255 --> 00:12:38.542
because they have heights

00:12:38.702 --> 00:12:44.934
and they are the only ones who can capture the clouds.

00:12:45.094 --> 00:12:47.422
So such a rapport there is

00:12:47.582 --> 00:12:53.007
between the humility of the ocean

00:12:53.167 --> 00:12:57.391
and the heights of the mountain.

00:12:57.551 --> 00:13:00.703
That’s how a Sahaja yogi should be.

00:13:00.863 --> 00:13:08.583
He is too high because so much of

00:13:13.516 --> 00:13:17.022
content is there in that ocean,

00:13:17.182 --> 00:13:20.382
then it has become beautiful

00:13:20.542 --> 00:13:28.742
like clouds and touched his height, his Kailasha

00:13:28.902 --> 00:13:31.957
where resides the Shiva.

00:13:32.117 --> 00:13:36.477
So it’s so joy-giving.

00:13:37.925 --> 00:13:41.102
Of course as you have painted Me there,

00:13:41.262 --> 00:13:45.382
it’s true that was My situation once upon a time.

00:13:45.542 --> 00:13:47.942
Today also it is My situation no doubt,

00:13:48.102 --> 00:13:49.902
in a very subtle manner,

00:13:50.062 --> 00:13:53.142
because there’s so much of negativity

00:13:53.302 --> 00:14:00.502
and I have to work it out on all kinds of levels.

00:14:06.925 --> 00:14:10.982
There is no excuse for some human being to be a devil,

00:14:11.142 --> 00:14:15.516
no excuse, and for a Sahaja yogi there is no excuse at all.

00:14:15.676 --> 00:14:19.517
But still once I have called you My son, My child,

00:14:19.677 --> 00:14:22.878
there is a little blessing;

00:14:23.038 --> 00:14:28.006
goes, I would say, a long rope.

00:14:29.342 --> 00:14:35.422
But that long rope one should not care for.

00:14:35.582 --> 00:14:40.102
You have to care for your own quality,

00:14:40.262 --> 00:14:45.822
for your own inner capacity to suck in.

00:14:46.422 --> 00:14:49.430
Now look at the ocean as it is.

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:56.253
All that is around falls into the ocean, everything.

00:14:56.838 --> 00:15:03.047
And then the sun – we can say that’s the Spirit – evaporates.

00:15:03.207 --> 00:15:06.590
Only possible in the ocean.

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:09.982
It doesn’t evaporate the rivers so much as it can

00:15:10.142 --> 00:15:12.727
because it’s such a wide thing, such a deep thing,

00:15:12.887 --> 00:15:16.042
inexhaustible.

00:15:16.202 --> 00:15:23.122
And then absolutely pure material comes out of that,

00:15:23.745 --> 00:15:28.120
and that can go and touch the heart.

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:32.163
Because as a Sahaja Yogi those hearts are at a very high level

00:15:32.323 --> 00:15:38.101
where there is Shiva residing.

00:15:38.745 --> 00:15:43.865
Nobody can reach there except for the purity,

00:15:44.249 --> 00:15:48.849
and unless and until you have that largeness,

00:15:49.041 --> 00:15:55.580
that depth, that humility, and the maryadas.

00:15:55.740 --> 00:16:00.482
You know that sea never leaves its own maryadas,

00:16:00.642 --> 00:16:04.762
and if you press it from one end it will express on one other side –

00:16:04.922 --> 00:16:06.682
it never leaves.

00:16:06.842 --> 00:16:10.602
If Pacific Ocean was

00:16:10.762 --> 00:16:15.090
even hundred feet deeper there would have been a problem.

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:21.202
So even in depth, in its height, in its spreading

00:16:21.362 --> 00:16:23.250
it has its own maryadas.

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:28.362
But in that maryada he has the feeling

00:16:28.522 --> 00:16:32.130
that he is one with the nature, one with Mother.

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:35.939
He is not disturbing the Mother Earth,

00:16:36.099 --> 00:16:41.166
nicely placed in the body of Mother Earth.

00:16:42.865 --> 00:16:46.722
Nature is bound by the Divine.

00:16:46.882 --> 00:16:48.882
The Divine looks after the nature.

00:16:49.042 --> 00:16:53.568
So everything works out beautifully and you have freedom.

00:16:53.728 --> 00:16:58.228
And after Sahaja Yoga you have greater freedom,

00:16:59.042 --> 00:17:03.178
absolute freedom, because you cannot be bound

00:17:03.338 --> 00:17:10.562
by anything nonsensical, anything sinful, anything base.

00:17:10.722 --> 00:17:16.218
You are above that like a mountain.

00:17:17.287 --> 00:17:21.579
And so wherever there is a combination

00:17:21.739 --> 00:17:26.940
of a mountain and an ocean, the ships can come.

00:17:27.976 --> 00:17:31.394
Deep people can only come to such shores

00:17:31.554 --> 00:17:34.249
where there is depth.

00:17:34.409 --> 00:17:37.642
That’s how you achieve your depth,

00:17:37.802 --> 00:17:44.002
between your Heart and your Bhavasagara,

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:47.675
that beautiful area where people can come to you

00:17:47.835 --> 00:17:52.467
and just they know this is something great,

00:17:56.016 --> 00:17:59.482
everybody knows that.

00:17:59.642 --> 00:18:03.762
You have seen that I am like any other woman to look at.

00:18:03.922 --> 00:18:08.616
I don’t know, you might think I am different, but normally…

00:18:09.209 --> 00:18:13.242
But how many people come to My program?

00:18:13.402 --> 00:18:16.387
How do they come to My program? Must think.

00:18:16.547 --> 00:18:21.460
In Colombia when nobody had even heard My name,

00:18:28.985 --> 00:18:32.602
thousands came – I mean, very surprising.

00:18:32.762 --> 00:18:36.190
And people had no place to sit.

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:39.793
In Russia where, I mean, no question of My, their knowing My name,

00:18:39.953 --> 00:18:44.062
there are no books published, nothing.

00:18:47.002 --> 00:18:50.122
So you can say that, “Mother,

00:18:50.282 --> 00:18:54.984
You manipulate it through the collective unconscious.”

00:18:55.144 --> 00:18:59.584
I do not, but it does – I think so.

00:19:01.162 --> 00:19:08.387
So when the Sahaja yogis have that content within themselves,

00:19:08.576 --> 00:19:12.250
the collective unconscious,

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:18.010
the Divine will act, definitely act.

00:19:18.962 --> 00:19:22.482
Like a person who is spreading advertisements,

00:19:22.642 --> 00:19:25.922
this that, yes people come.

00:19:26.082 --> 00:19:31.242
Because he takes money they think they can purchase this man.

00:19:31.402 --> 00:19:33.082
But where there is no money involved,

00:19:33.242 --> 00:19:35.770
no business involved, nothing,

00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:42.507
you people are just simple people just like them, so?

00:19:43.449 --> 00:19:48.209
But it’s all done by the Divine, isn’t it?

00:19:49.769 --> 00:19:53.562
So the Divine works it out.

00:19:53.722 --> 00:20:00.137
But if the Sahaja yogis in a place are good for nothing,

00:20:00.297 --> 00:20:05.489
then even if I am there it does not work.

00:20:05.649 --> 00:20:10.009
Half-hearted people if they are it does not work.

00:20:10.441 --> 00:20:13.707
In no way to discourage you but to tell you

00:20:13.867 --> 00:20:17.513
that you have to develop your content within yourself,

00:20:17.673 --> 00:20:21.450
a complete faith in yourself.

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:26.850
This is the greatest property of a Sahaja yogi.

00:20:28.722 --> 00:20:30.786
And what is this ocean?

00:20:30.946 --> 00:20:35.306
It’s love, it’s love and love.

00:20:37.402 --> 00:20:41.885
It doesn’t talk, it doesn’t do much, nothing is to be done in this.

00:20:42.045 --> 00:20:44.842
It just works spontaneously.

00:20:45.002 --> 00:20:48.482
The less you do the better.

00:20:49.362 --> 00:20:53.408
The more you try to do, “I will do this, manipulate there”, no,

00:20:53.568 --> 00:20:57.992
you just develop your content within yourself.

00:21:02.121 --> 00:21:04.546
And imagine, you are all so lucky,

00:21:04.706 --> 00:21:07.633
you have so many provisions which nobody had.

00:21:07.793 --> 00:21:11.234
They had to go into jungles, they had to

00:21:11.394 --> 00:21:15.249
take all the wrath of their gurus

00:21:15.409 --> 00:21:20.005
and nobody to protect them.

00:21:21.079 --> 00:21:25.876
And they never had Adi Shakti to worship.

00:21:28.058 --> 00:21:30.402
So you have Adi Shakti with you,

00:21:30.562 --> 00:21:35.322
whose power is all this Divine.

00:21:36.191 --> 00:21:39.922
So you are at such an advantageous position.

00:21:40.082 --> 00:21:42.907
But first you must realize.

00:21:43.067 --> 00:21:46.962
So when we say we should have content,

00:21:47.122 --> 00:21:51.322
then the vessel has to be strong

00:21:52.073 --> 00:21:56.562
otherwise everything will break.

00:21:56.722 --> 00:22:00.256
And this strength is the one you should know,

00:22:00.416 --> 00:22:04.696
that you are completely protected.

00:22:05.162 --> 00:22:07.131
No one can harm you.

00:22:07.291 --> 00:22:08.418
They’ll try.

00:22:08.578 --> 00:22:10.980
This has to be otherwise how will you test

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:14.362
whether you are absolutely safe or not.

00:22:14.522 --> 00:22:17.768
So somebody has to try some tricks

00:22:17.928 --> 00:22:23.868
just to see and for you to watch how you are successful.

00:22:24.028 --> 00:22:26.242
Without doing anything you’ll be amazed,

00:22:26.402 --> 00:22:28.428
everything will be cleared out.

00:22:28.588 --> 00:22:31.026
And you’ll not know how things have cleared out,

00:22:31.186 --> 00:22:34.906
how things have worked out.

00:22:37.522 --> 00:22:39.682
So the strength comes.

00:22:39.842 --> 00:22:44.222
Again the question is how the strength comes into a Sahaja yogi.

00:22:44.382 --> 00:22:48.027
There I would say it’s the shraddha.

00:22:48.187 --> 00:22:50.730
Shraddha is not blind faith.

00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:54.442
After Sahaja Yoga, after realization

00:22:54.602 --> 00:22:57.842
you know everything.

00:23:00.242 --> 00:23:02.488
You’ve seen My photographs,

00:23:02.648 --> 00:23:05.002
you have seen how Sahaja Yoga works,

00:23:05.162 --> 00:23:07.992
you’ve seen how you can raise the Kundalini of people,

00:23:08.152 --> 00:23:12.115
you can feel the vibrations;

00:23:13.897 --> 00:23:17.313
you can feel others', you can cure others.

00:23:17.473 --> 00:23:20.002
All this power is within you.

00:23:20.162 --> 00:23:24.002
But just to realize

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.602
that power without ego is your strength.

00:23:29.762 --> 00:23:32.002
And when you are powerful you don’t have the ego

00:23:32.162 --> 00:23:34.338
because what is the need there?

00:23:34.498 --> 00:23:38.162
Ego is there only when you don’t have power

00:23:38.322 --> 00:23:41.906
because you want to have more, more, more.

00:23:42.066 --> 00:23:47.638
But when you are fully there, there’s no ego.

00:23:47.842 --> 00:23:52.994
So this power is to be ascertained first,

00:23:53.154 --> 00:23:57.322
to find out whether you are powerful or not,

00:23:57.482 --> 00:23:59.650
to find out first.

00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:02.977
And then, like if I’ve to sit on the chair I’ll see,

00:24:03.137 --> 00:24:04.914
“Is it all right or it’s shaking?"

00:24:05.074 --> 00:24:08.354
"Oh it’s all right, I can sit on this.”

00:24:13.941 --> 00:24:18.322
Some Sahaja yogis still remain on the periphery.

00:24:18.482 --> 00:24:24.042
There’s sometimes a very big gap between some

00:24:24.202 --> 00:24:27.042
who have reached great heights and some

00:24:27.202 --> 00:24:29.802
who are outside.

00:24:29.962 --> 00:24:31.882
All these are negative forces

00:24:32.042 --> 00:24:35.282
which were killed long time back.

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:44.290
Only one Shakti was sufficient to kill them,

00:24:45.386 --> 00:24:50.300
of Kali Shakti, Durga Shakti,

00:24:50.537 --> 00:24:54.657
but you have so many of them.

00:24:55.762 --> 00:24:58.889
You have Mahalakshmi Shakti,

00:24:59.049 --> 00:25:01.396
you’ve got Saraswati Shakti,

00:25:01.556 --> 00:25:06.236
you have all the twelve deities are there working for you.

00:25:11.882 --> 00:25:18.155
So “realizing it” is the meaning that

00:25:18.315 --> 00:25:23.288
you must have complete faith in yourself.

00:25:23.562 --> 00:25:27.030
If you still doubt yourself,

00:25:29.769 --> 00:25:32.482
that’s also a human quality.

00:25:32.642 --> 00:25:35.075
I mean a dog knows that he’s a dog.

00:25:35.235 --> 00:25:40.090
He doesn’t doubt that he’s a dog, or a cat, does he?

00:25:42.202 --> 00:25:43.842
Or a tiger knows he’s a tiger,

00:25:44.002 --> 00:25:46.282
and he knows what capacities he’s got.

00:25:46.442 --> 00:25:49.768
It’s only the human beings have got apart from other

00:25:49.928 --> 00:25:55.488
stupid qualities is one, this, that they can doubt themselves.

00:26:01.442 --> 00:26:08.362
And this doubting quality has made them cowards.

00:26:08.522 --> 00:26:14.162
In Sahaja Yoga you should have no doubts about yourself,

00:26:15.482 --> 00:26:17.987
“Because I’m doing, still doing like this, Mother,

00:26:18.147 --> 00:26:20.945
I am still doing like this, then how?”

00:26:21.105 --> 00:26:24.082
Then get rid of it!

00:26:24.242 --> 00:26:26.002
I mean, how can I solve your problem

00:26:26.162 --> 00:26:28.482
if you want to carry monkey on your back?

00:26:28.642 --> 00:26:30.602
And I’m still carrying the monkey on your back.

00:26:30.762 --> 00:26:33.002
You get rid of the monkey, finished.

00:26:33.162 --> 00:26:35.202
It’s so simple. I mean to My simple logic,

00:26:35.362 --> 00:26:38.473
this is what is the answer.

00:26:38.633 --> 00:26:41.420
Why do you want to carry the monkey and then come and tell Me,

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:48.272
“Mother, I am carrying the monkey”? I can see it!

00:26:50.712 --> 00:26:55.578
Get it off your head! Get it off your back!

00:26:55.738 --> 00:27:00.012
It’s very simple, you are a Sahaja yogi.

00:27:02.656 --> 00:27:05.519
And this is what I’ve found about Russians.

00:27:05.679 --> 00:27:08.482
They didn’t have any monkeys really, very surprising.

00:27:08.642 --> 00:27:12.386
I think there are no monkeys at all there.

00:27:12.762 --> 00:27:15.334
None of them!

00:27:16.922 --> 00:27:21.042
No private problems, no public problems, no any other problem,

00:27:21.202 --> 00:27:25.609
nothing, nothing, they discuss nothing.

00:27:25.769 --> 00:27:28.199
This is the, they could have said that

00:27:28.359 --> 00:27:32.410
“Our government is such, it’s…”, nothing, nothing, nothing.

00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:35.202
They had enough of everything, they must have.

00:27:35.362 --> 00:27:38.095
Very well-read people, very well-educated,

00:27:38.255 --> 00:27:41.664
very big professions, very humble,

00:27:41.824 --> 00:27:47.335
very open-hearted; they just wanted realization, that’s all.

00:27:47.495 --> 00:27:50.002
They said, “You have come here for our liberation.”

00:27:50.162 --> 00:27:52.490
They would even touch My sari like that.

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:56.296
The place I walk they would touch, just imagine.

00:27:56.456 --> 00:28:01.772
Who has told them about vibrations? I never said I am Adi Shakti.

00:28:02.322 --> 00:28:05.064
How did they recognize Me?

00:28:05.224 --> 00:28:10.776
They developed that strength within themselves, that shraddha.

00:28:10.936 --> 00:28:13.497
And they never talked about God in that country.

00:28:13.657 --> 00:28:15.777
They have some stupid people who have

00:28:15.937 --> 00:28:21.607
churches and things like that and Islamic institutions, but

00:28:21.767 --> 00:28:25.962
most of the people are so strong

00:28:26.122 --> 00:28:29.162
and the content is showing itself.

00:28:29.322 --> 00:28:31.762
Imagine every time they have a program,

00:28:31.922 --> 00:28:33.522
even now on follow-on,

00:28:33.682 --> 00:28:37.922
at least one thousand people are there.

00:28:40.177 --> 00:28:45.526
In this England we can’t even get one thousand for Devi Puja.

00:28:46.282 --> 00:28:49.040
And they come all the way from thousands of miles,

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:52.162
from Siberia, this, that.

00:28:52.322 --> 00:28:53.689
And they have booked themselves,

00:28:53.849 --> 00:28:56.602
because there the halls you have to pay for.

00:28:56.762 --> 00:28:59.882
So though the Sahaja yogis don’t take money, but they pay for halls.

00:29:00.042 --> 00:29:05.072
But the mediocrity to be on the periphery,

00:29:05.232 --> 00:29:09.138
not to work it out, take it easy,

00:29:10.468 --> 00:29:13.922
not the way for Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:14.082 --> 00:29:16.842
We don’t have to kill demons.

00:29:17.002 --> 00:29:23.282
There’s no need to join any war

00:29:23.602 --> 00:29:29.842
or to fight like soldiers as they fought with Devi, nothing.

00:29:30.602 --> 00:29:33.962
You have just to take out the negativity within yourself,

00:29:34.122 --> 00:29:38.847
lethargy from you, but work it out.

00:29:40.962 --> 00:29:44.887
We say mantras, we know what are the powers of the mantras are,

00:29:45.047 --> 00:29:48.362
but you have to keep them awakened.

00:29:48.522 --> 00:29:52.962
For that I have told you a hundred times, you must meditate.

00:29:53.122 --> 00:29:54.282
Not the way to meditate,

00:29:54.442 --> 00:29:56.842
"All right, it’s like playing golf, sort of."

00:29:57.002 --> 00:30:02.122
It’s not that way. It’s a serious thing,

00:30:02.282 --> 00:30:07.050
you are worshipping the Adi Shakti.

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:13.754
With that complete understanding and dedication

00:30:14.145 --> 00:30:19.722
you have to do it; not a mechanical thing, it’s not a game.

00:30:19.882 --> 00:30:24.086
It’s something very subtle and special.

00:30:24.402 --> 00:30:29.258
In no action we can describe it,

00:30:29.442 --> 00:30:37.202
but it’s just a very deep feeling.

00:30:38.162 --> 00:30:40.842
To that depth no other feeling goes;

00:30:41.017 --> 00:30:44.563
with that feeling you have to meditate.

00:30:44.723 --> 00:30:46.671
And then see the results.

00:30:46.831 --> 00:30:49.402
Many people say, “I’ve done this, Mother, I’ve done that.

00:30:49.562 --> 00:30:51.722
I’ve this still” –

00:30:51.882 --> 00:30:57.562
because you are not deep enough.

00:30:59.155 --> 00:31:04.042
It’s not how much you pray,

00:31:04.202 --> 00:31:08.482
it’s not how many words you use for prayer,

00:31:08.642 --> 00:31:13.816
but it is how deeply you have touched

00:31:15.082 --> 00:31:23.282
the feet of the Divine that is important.

00:31:24.122 --> 00:31:29.317
So today we have to see that

00:31:29.477 --> 00:31:36.429
Devi is using Her sword to pierce through our heart

00:31:38.082 --> 00:31:41.162
so that all negativity runs away,

00:31:41.322 --> 00:31:47.235
and through that She wants to plant the lotus

00:31:47.395 --> 00:31:50.435
for Shiva to settle down.

00:31:50.922 --> 00:31:56.522
She wants to take away all that ugliness from within.

00:31:56.682 --> 00:31:58.882
It’s like an operation

00:31:59.042 --> 00:32:03.402
but so delicate and so beautifully done,

00:32:03.562 --> 00:32:05.682
you never even felt it.

00:32:05.842 --> 00:32:09.802
The other day somebody gave Me a book of on the Devi's

00:32:09.962 --> 00:32:13.202
and the vibrations are called as 'spanda' – means 'pulsation'

00:32:13.362 --> 00:32:15.522
– it’s correct, no doubt,

00:32:15.682 --> 00:32:18.562
and it’s called as 'anahata' in Sanskrit language,

00:32:18.722 --> 00:32:21.202
meaning 'without percussions'.

00:32:21.362 --> 00:32:23.122
But I was reading that book, I said,

00:32:23.282 --> 00:32:27.082
“It’s like going round and round, up and down,

00:32:27.242 --> 00:32:29.402
going into ‘this means, that means'."

00:32:29.602 --> 00:32:32.522
How can anybody understand this book, it’s so terrible!

00:32:32.682 --> 00:32:36.042
While I have said all these things and much more than this,

00:32:36.202 --> 00:32:40.242
and they know it so easily.

00:32:40.402 --> 00:32:44.922
If you read that book, two pages, you’ll get a headache, I tell you.

00:32:45.082 --> 00:32:48.402
But how the whole knowledge of Sahaja Yoga

00:32:48.562 --> 00:32:53.202
has come to you so beautifully,

00:32:54.522 --> 00:32:58.962
it’s very remarkable, I tell you.

00:33:02.202 --> 00:33:07.602
If you read the mantras they’ll give you explanations

00:33:07.762 --> 00:33:10.945
which has nothing to do with reality sometimes, I feel.

00:33:11.105 --> 00:33:18.065
But even if it has, it’s so circuitous, so complicated.

00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:24.683
I would say Adi Shankaracharya realized it and that’s why

00:33:24.843 --> 00:33:27.607
He gave up the idea of writing any treatises and,

00:33:27.767 --> 00:33:30.162
“Let’s make it simple, the praise of the Mother." Finished.

00:33:30.322 --> 00:33:32.522
"If you praise the Mother, everything okay.”

00:33:32.682 --> 00:33:35.560
But that’s not. I find that’s not so, it’s easy.

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:37.802
You see, human beings are great experts,

00:33:37.962 --> 00:33:40.562
they can be just like radios praising, praising.

00:33:40.722 --> 00:33:43.980
Nothing goes inside the heart.

00:33:47.527 --> 00:33:51.247
But you have to develop that depth.

00:33:51.602 --> 00:33:53.482
In Sahaja Yoga we work through our heart,

00:33:53.642 --> 00:33:56.202
not through our brains.

00:33:56.434 --> 00:34:00.014
You have to develop that heart

00:34:02.384 --> 00:34:10.330
and to receive into it the greatness of other people.

00:34:12.898 --> 00:34:18.041
Now people can see what’s wrong with others very easily.

00:34:18.201 --> 00:34:21.075
They don’t want to see what’s wrong with them.

00:34:21.235 --> 00:34:22.899
Any intelligent man can see that,

00:34:23.059 --> 00:34:25.327
there’s no need to have his realization.

00:34:25.487 --> 00:34:28.362
But a wise person sees what’s wrong with him

00:34:28.522 --> 00:34:31.682
and he trusts. He trusts

00:34:31.842 --> 00:34:36.563
himself then because he’s wise.

00:34:37.818 --> 00:34:41.617
He doesn’t doubt, he knows he’s wise.

00:34:41.777 --> 00:34:45.450
He knows what’s wrong with him and what is to be done.

00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:51.554
So the work of the Goddess is very different today,

00:34:51.714 --> 00:34:53.681
as you can see it clearly.

00:34:53.841 --> 00:34:58.321
Of course, symbolically it is the same

00:34:58.649 --> 00:35:02.576
but it has become very subtle, very subtle.

00:35:02.736 --> 00:35:07.576
The first work is to destroy the negativity

00:35:08.002 --> 00:35:10.025
which is going on as you know.

00:35:10.185 --> 00:35:13.321
The more light comes in, the ignorance will disappear.

00:35:13.481 --> 00:35:17.127
This light will spread, all the darkness will go away.

00:35:17.287 --> 00:35:20.967
But you are the lights.

00:35:22.233 --> 00:35:25.442
You have to put the lights on

00:35:25.794 --> 00:35:28.090
and you have to look after your light,

00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:33.930
and you have to make that light eternal.

00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:41.760
This is one work which you are doing.

00:35:43.722 --> 00:35:47.202
It’s a beautiful work of the Goddess you are doing

00:35:47.362 --> 00:35:52.802
is to spread light, enlighten people.

00:35:53.082 --> 00:35:56.602
The negativity that is around you

00:35:56.762 --> 00:36:00.562
is not so dangerous as whatever is in you.

00:36:00.842 --> 00:36:03.495
Today it has become subtler.

00:36:03.655 --> 00:36:06.322
The negativity has become subtler.

00:36:06.482 --> 00:36:08.730
It’s entered into your being,

00:36:08.890 --> 00:36:13.849
and be careful – it may anytime topple you.

00:36:17.168 --> 00:36:19.968
Even one step

00:36:20.362 --> 00:36:22.867
you do not put right when you are climbing up,

00:36:23.027 --> 00:36:25.547
you can go down.

00:36:25.896 --> 00:36:29.707
So one has to be alert, without tension.

00:36:29.867 --> 00:36:33.192
You have to be alert without tension.

00:36:33.352 --> 00:36:36.922
And the alertness grows.

00:36:37.082 --> 00:36:41.474
When the light goes within you start seeing it.

00:36:41.634 --> 00:36:44.009
Immediately you see, “Oh, that’s it!

00:36:44.169 --> 00:36:48.335
So I, the so and so – that’s it!”

00:36:48.495 --> 00:36:53.121
And you know how to correct it and you know how to put it right.

00:36:53.281 --> 00:36:54.922
And immediately you take to it.

00:36:55.082 --> 00:36:59.762
Like a good sari now has something fallen on it,

00:36:59.922 --> 00:37:03.162
immediately you clean it.

00:37:05.321 --> 00:37:13.787
In the same way we have to be very, very alert;

00:37:13.947 --> 00:37:16.737
'daksha' is the word for that.

00:37:16.897 --> 00:37:20.843
Now this was the work of the Goddess before.

00:37:21.003 --> 00:37:23.322
Goddess used to give enlightenment

00:37:23.482 --> 00:37:26.091
and Goddess used to be alert for you.

00:37:26.251 --> 00:37:30.291
She would sit like a tigress for Her children.

00:37:30.482 --> 00:37:32.642
They are praying, they are doing puja,

00:37:32.802 --> 00:37:37.451
they are doing some sort of a homa, havana,

00:37:37.611 --> 00:37:40.439
so the Goddess would sit down, protect them

00:37:40.599 --> 00:37:42.858
from all negativity coming,

00:37:43.018 --> 00:37:46.151
all rakshasas coming, kill them, this, do that.

00:37:46.311 --> 00:37:52.414
But that stage is gone now. Now She’s entered into you.

00:37:54.042 --> 00:37:56.408
So you have to kill your negativity,

00:37:56.568 --> 00:38:01.350
you’ve become as powerful as your Mother.

00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:06.690
No negativity can touch you.

00:38:07.531 --> 00:38:12.249
So you can give realization, you’ve got that power very well;

00:38:12.409 --> 00:38:18.769
and you can watch your defects more than that of others.

00:38:19.922 --> 00:38:23.442
And you try to put them out because they’re not good,

00:38:23.602 --> 00:38:27.802
they’re not for your benevolence, they’re not for your ascent.

00:38:27.962 --> 00:38:31.305
By that nobody is going to gain.

00:38:32.127 --> 00:38:36.355
At the collective level it just works automatically.

00:38:36.515 --> 00:38:38.126
You don’t have to worry.

00:38:38.286 --> 00:38:42.522
It comes to culmination and a person goes out;

00:38:42.682 --> 00:38:46.682
as if somebody runs up like a blind fellow

00:38:46.842 --> 00:38:49.562
on a cliff and jumps, jumps down.

00:38:49.722 --> 00:38:52.082
You don’t have to worry too much about this.

00:38:52.242 --> 00:38:56.982
It just works. You have seen it has worked that way.

00:39:00.555 --> 00:39:03.883
Now another quality that you have:

00:39:04.043 --> 00:39:06.442
to believe that Goddess is working through you.

00:39:06.602 --> 00:39:10.522
In you She resides, you have got the powers,

00:39:10.682 --> 00:39:13.202
it’s penetrated into you

00:39:13.362 --> 00:39:20.762
is that you can comfort people, you can cure them,

00:39:22.962 --> 00:39:28.244
you can give them peace, you can give them bliss.

00:39:28.569 --> 00:39:31.722
But then what Goddess has done in you is that

00:39:31.882 --> 00:39:36.250
She has given you the bliss, you have become bliss.

00:39:36.441 --> 00:39:40.722
Like there’s say a cool air-conditioner,

00:39:40.882 --> 00:39:42.282
you get the cool from there.

00:39:42.442 --> 00:39:45.282
In the same way if you are emitting bliss,

00:39:45.442 --> 00:39:46.762
you give bliss to others.

00:39:46.922 --> 00:39:49.402
But there is no bliss within yourself,

00:39:49.562 --> 00:39:52.353
but what bliss you can give to others?

00:39:52.513 --> 00:39:55.737
So a Sahaja yogi has to be a blissful like the Goddess.

00:39:55.897 --> 00:39:57.937
You see She has very extreme characters,

00:39:58.103 --> 00:40:02.538
as you must have known that She’s extremely cruel,

00:40:02.698 --> 00:40:04.442
She can be very cruel,

00:40:04.602 --> 00:40:08.737
and She can be extremely gentle

00:40:08.897 --> 00:40:12.724
– like two ragas of yesterday.

00:40:14.082 --> 00:40:27.439
She could be extremely harsh, extremely harsh,

00:40:27.599 --> 00:40:31.370
beyond all human expectations,

00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:37.930
and She could be extremely mild.

00:40:40.882 --> 00:40:47.962
So this harsh part you need not have.

00:40:48.202 --> 00:40:50.202
It will just work.

00:40:50.362 --> 00:40:53.922
This part is only kept for the Divine.

00:40:54.082 --> 00:40:56.760
You just take to the other side.

00:40:56.920 --> 00:41:00.522
Let this harsh part be looked after by the Divine.

00:41:00.682 --> 00:41:02.602
After all, Divine also must do some work.

00:41:02.762 --> 00:41:09.962
If you do all the work then what will Divine do?

00:41:10.538 --> 00:41:13.896
So the Divine will look after that part.

00:41:14.056 --> 00:41:19.232
So you have to enjoy yourself as the Goddess enjoys Herself;

00:41:19.392 --> 00:41:21.967
enjoys Her bliss, enjoys Her peace,

00:41:22.127 --> 00:41:26.305
enjoys Her everything: Her creation, Her children,

00:41:26.465 --> 00:41:29.146
their love – everything She enjoys.

00:41:29.306 --> 00:41:32.583
In the same way you have to enjoy.

00:41:33.802 --> 00:41:36.402
You have to know about everything,

00:41:36.562 --> 00:41:40.468
you have to be absolutely knowledgeable.

00:41:43.342 --> 00:41:48.222
And nothing more is needed but just to say that

00:41:48.382 --> 00:41:52.102
“Oh Divine, please protect us.”

00:41:52.262 --> 00:41:54.710
At the most!

00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:58.582
Even if you don’t say it’s all right, you are looked after.

00:41:58.742 --> 00:42:00.862
The Divine is working out the stage, you see.

00:42:01.022 --> 00:42:05.534
You don’t see it, all there, invisible.

00:42:05.694 --> 00:42:07.222
And you are on the stage,

00:42:07.382 --> 00:42:09.542
so they are looking out what to focus light,

00:42:09.702 --> 00:42:12.302
where to put, what light to put, what is to be done,

00:42:12.462 --> 00:42:13.702
what is to be changed around.

00:42:13.862 --> 00:42:18.647
Everything they are arranging. You are nicely here.

00:42:18.807 --> 00:42:21.087
So you need not do all that work.

00:42:21.247 --> 00:42:26.406
You do your work of acting and saying dialogues.

00:42:26.566 --> 00:42:31.183
That’s your work. Let them do their jobs, they are doing very well.

00:42:31.343 --> 00:42:38.383
They are excellently placed and they are experts.

00:42:39.255 --> 00:42:42.589
So to leave certain things into the hands

00:42:42.749 --> 00:42:47.931
of the Divine is what we call as 'surrender'.

00:42:48.582 --> 00:42:53.526
And that much of this, if done, then

00:42:53.854 --> 00:42:57.692
most of your things will work out so miraculously.

00:42:57.852 --> 00:43:02.542
I mean, you’ll be amazed, “How, Mother, how it is worked out?

00:43:02.702 --> 00:43:07.998
We never expected how things we got it done?”

00:43:08.158 --> 00:43:10.518
There’s a very, very big force working:

00:43:10.678 --> 00:43:14.142
the Force, the Energy

00:43:14.302 --> 00:43:17.359
which is the Source of all the energies,

00:43:17.519 --> 00:43:20.456
which has created this great universe,

00:43:20.616 --> 00:43:23.896
which has created this Mother Earth, created this sun,

00:43:24.136 --> 00:43:27.952
which has created you very delicately.

00:43:28.112 --> 00:43:30.752
This Force is working.

00:43:31.552 --> 00:43:33.312
And that Force is looking after you,

00:43:33.472 --> 00:43:38.991
so proud of you that you have come on the stage now.

00:43:42.766 --> 00:43:47.583
So as it is we are today praying to the Goddess that

00:43:47.743 --> 00:43:52.083
“Help us to fight our negativity within us.

00:43:52.327 --> 00:43:54.472
Give us Your tiger so that we fight,

00:43:54.632 --> 00:43:58.232
give us Your lion so we fight.”

00:43:58.392 --> 00:44:02.622
Let us fight all these horrible animals that are within us,

00:44:02.782 --> 00:44:06.606
these horrible haunting things that are within us,

00:44:06.766 --> 00:44:09.135
these horrible conditionings we have.

00:44:09.295 --> 00:44:12.358
You have to get rid of it.

00:44:12.518 --> 00:44:16.695
Still, still if you watch yourself, lots of conditionings are there,

00:44:16.855 --> 00:44:20.272
lots of things, you see. If you see,

00:44:20.432 --> 00:44:25.518
there are covered with very thin curtains and you don’t see it,

00:44:25.712 --> 00:44:28.326
but they are there.

00:44:28.486 --> 00:44:33.238
But let the tiger enter into all these dens and find out.

00:44:33.398 --> 00:44:36.029
And you enjoy that, riding over the horse,

00:44:36.189 --> 00:44:42.309
riding over the lion, and riding over the tiger

00:44:42.927 --> 00:44:45.975
– like a Goddess. Why not?

00:44:46.135 --> 00:44:51.592
After all, children get all the heritage of the mother, don’t they?

00:44:51.766 --> 00:44:54.952
So you have all the heritage available to you.

00:44:55.112 --> 00:44:58.991
But you have to be worthy,

00:44:59.151 --> 00:45:03.709
in the sense that you have to know that you are worthy, that’s all.

00:45:03.869 --> 00:45:07.322
You have to just know that you are worthy

00:45:07.482 --> 00:45:09.962
and that you can do it.

00:45:10.930 --> 00:45:16.324
So again today we are here to do this puja,

00:45:16.962 --> 00:45:21.995
which would have been in Perth but somehow or other it was not so,

00:45:22.155 --> 00:45:26.547
and is luck for you to have this puja.

00:45:26.707 --> 00:45:32.258
And it is something of a very deeper nature,

00:45:32.418 --> 00:45:36.441
very subtler nature.

00:45:37.975 --> 00:45:41.762
Like your blood it is, because on these seven days they say

00:45:41.922 --> 00:45:45.205
the Goddess has to wear the red all the time

00:45:45.365 --> 00:45:47.642
because it’s blood.

00:45:47.802 --> 00:45:52.801
And the first color you see in the womb of your mother is red.

00:45:52.961 --> 00:45:57.915
It’s the security. One side is the red rag,

00:45:58.075 --> 00:46:01.010
another side it is the security.

00:46:01.170 --> 00:46:05.530
So for you it is the security around you.

00:46:05.690 --> 00:46:11.565
Every place you go, it is there – just feel it.

00:46:11.962 --> 00:46:16.878
You have entered I must say, entered the Kingdom of God,

00:46:17.038 --> 00:46:20.314
no doubt about it. You all have entered,

00:46:20.474 --> 00:46:22.943
so beautifully you are settled down.

00:46:23.122 --> 00:46:26.816
May God bless you.
