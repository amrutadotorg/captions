WEBVTT

05:08.386 --> 05:12.886
It was very spontaneously decided

05:13.046 --> 05:22.846
that we should have the Devi Puja in England.

05:27.678 --> 05:32.120
And this is the place where really Devi Puja should be,

05:32.280 --> 05:35.759
because it’s the place of Sadashiva

05:35.919 --> 05:39.759
and where Adi Shakti should be worshipped.

05:51.031 --> 05:56.551
We have to today understand

05:57.047 --> 06:01.367
that why do we do Devi Puja?

06:02.592 --> 06:09.432
What is the reason for this Devi Puja?

06:10.063 --> 06:12.982
What do we get out of it?

06:13.142 --> 06:18.777
What are we supposed to achieve in our contents

06:18.937 --> 06:22.091
within ourselves?

06:25.049 --> 06:31.969
The first thing is that Kundalini is the Devi.

06:32.679 --> 06:36.199
She’s the reflection of the Adi Shakti.

06:37.672 --> 06:40.859
So when you worship Devi,

06:41.019 --> 06:45.261
first you worship also your own Kundalini

06:45.421 --> 06:52.426
by giving Her credit because She has given you this realization.

06:53.191 --> 06:55.960
It’s much deeper understanding

06:56.120 --> 06:59.889
than normally people have about the Devi Puja

07:00.049 --> 07:03.470
because they are not realized souls.

07:03.630 --> 07:06.121
Their Kundalini not is awakened.

07:06.281 --> 07:09.632
So normally when they do Devi Puja it’s for the purpose

07:09.792 --> 07:11.608
of getting realization

07:11.768 --> 07:14.247
so that the Devi should be pleased

07:14.407 --> 07:17.969
– prasanna – and should give them realization,

07:18.129 --> 07:21.379
or must get our chance to get to somebody

07:21.539 --> 07:25.087
who will give them realization.

07:26.662 --> 07:29.576
But you are at a different level now.

07:29.736 --> 07:34.166
So it’s more of a thanksgiving to your own Kundalini

07:34.326 --> 07:36.592
and to Adi Shakti,

07:36.752 --> 07:43.421
glorifying that whatever has happened so miraculously

07:43.581 --> 07:47.104
is because of the Kundalini which was within you,

07:47.264 --> 07:53.256
which was reflected by the Adi Shakti.

07:55.103 --> 07:59.468
But one has to know that

07:59.844 --> 08:08.103
only we are realized souls is not the point,

08:08.263 --> 08:13.143
only that we can feel the vibrations is not the point,

08:14.543 --> 08:20.064
that we can give realizations to other is also not the point.

08:22.696 --> 08:26.872
Then what is it? Very important –

08:27.032 --> 08:30.833
it’s the content within us.

08:31.172 --> 08:35.776
What do we have within us is the point.

08:35.936 --> 08:39.529
These are all the expressions of what we have within.

08:39.689 --> 08:43.511
Supposing somebody is generous,

08:43.671 --> 08:48.992
then know that he’s a rich man, otherwise he cannot be.

08:49.152 --> 08:54.432
So the content within us, we have to see.

08:55.406 --> 08:59.756
And when we start seeing the content,

09:04.432 --> 09:09.138
where do we find in the nature there is real content?

09:09.298 --> 09:16.363
We see the sea; sea is there you see, full of water.

09:18.224 --> 09:22.426
So much of water it sucks in from everywhere,

09:22.586 --> 09:28.161
and then it allows itself to be boiled by the sun

09:28.321 --> 09:31.505
and gives rain.

09:35.256 --> 09:39.713
But sea is the lowest level,

09:40.230 --> 09:41.914
stands at the lowest level

09:42.074 --> 09:46.415
and sucks in all the water from everywhere.

09:48.112 --> 09:52.649
In the same way a Sahaja yogi must know that

09:52.809 --> 09:59.161
to be really achieving more content,

09:59.321 --> 10:09.081
we have to be not at a higher level outside.

10:11.257 --> 10:13.913
It’s said in the Bible, “You have to be meek,”

10:14.073 --> 10:17.064
but I think it was not explained to people.

10:17.224 --> 10:22.338
Only the strong people can be meek,

10:22.498 --> 10:25.585
secured people can be meek,

10:25.745 --> 10:31.296
only the rich in essence can be meek,

10:31.456 --> 10:37.923
not the people who are insecured.

10:38.083 --> 10:42.663
Because they are insecured, how can they be meek?

10:44.872 --> 10:50.480
And not the people whom we think are rich, so-called,

10:50.640 --> 10:54.626
because if they are rich they are not generous,

10:54.786 --> 10:59.377
they are not satisfied, they are not philanthropic,

10:59.537 --> 11:04.719
so they are not rich. They are still greedy beggars.

11:07.408 --> 11:13.201
So the content within us is to be seen. What is our content?

11:16.288 --> 11:21.317
You love Me, I love you – it’s very good.

11:23.983 --> 11:29.183
But when you love Me,

11:29.807 --> 11:34.240
you have to know that there are certain qualities

11:34.400 --> 11:38.440
which are very lovable in a Sahaja yogi.

11:39.952 --> 11:44.768
Actually people get lost even after Sahaja Yoga.

11:44.928 --> 11:47.768
They think they can get over everything,

11:47.928 --> 11:50.248
they’re perfectly all right,

11:50.408 --> 11:54.364
and they are thrown overboard.

11:58.561 --> 12:01.127
So when we say that we have to be meek,

12:01.287 --> 12:06.650
this is a content, the humility is a content.

12:07.062 --> 12:11.902
So try to that, try to be humble with someone.

12:12.062 --> 12:15.302
You’ll like yourself.

12:17.942 --> 12:21.606
You’ll enjoy that quality within this that,

12:21.766 --> 12:26.013
“You see, I’m humbler than another person.”

12:26.989 --> 12:31.392
And what is another thing we find has content

12:31.646 --> 12:35.095
are the great mountains,

12:35.255 --> 12:38.542
because they have heights

12:38.702 --> 12:44.934
and they are the only ones who can capture the clouds.

12:45.094 --> 12:47.422
So such a rapport there is

12:47.582 --> 12:53.007
between the humility of the ocean

12:53.167 --> 12:57.391
and the heights of the mountain.

12:57.551 --> 13:00.703
That’s how a Sahaja yogi should be.

13:00.863 --> 13:08.583
He is too high because so much of

13:13.516 --> 13:17.022
content is there in that ocean,

13:17.182 --> 13:20.382
then it has become beautiful

13:20.542 --> 13:28.742
like clouds and touched his height, his Kailasha

13:28.902 --> 13:31.957
where resides the Shiva.

13:32.117 --> 13:36.477
So it’s so joy-giving.

13:37.925 --> 13:41.102
Of course as you have painted Me there,

13:41.262 --> 13:45.382
it’s true that was My situation once upon a time.

13:45.542 --> 13:47.942
Today also it is My situation no doubt,

13:48.102 --> 13:49.902
in a very subtle manner,

13:50.062 --> 13:53.142
because there’s so much of negativity

13:53.302 --> 14:00.502
and I have to work it out on all kinds of levels.

14:06.925 --> 14:10.982
There is no excuse for some human being to be a devil,

14:11.142 --> 14:15.516
no excuse, and for a Sahaja yogi there is no excuse at all.

14:15.676 --> 14:19.517
But still once I have called you My son, My child,

14:19.677 --> 14:22.878
there is a little blessing;

14:23.038 --> 14:28.006
goes, I would say, a long rope.

14:29.342 --> 14:35.422
But that long rope one should not care for.

14:35.582 --> 14:40.102
You have to care for your own quality,

14:40.262 --> 14:45.822
for your own inner capacity to suck in.

14:46.422 --> 14:49.430
Now look at the ocean as it is.

14:49.590 --> 14:56.253
All that is around falls into the ocean, everything.

14:56.838 --> 15:03.047
And then the sun – we can say that’s the Spirit – evaporates.

15:03.207 --> 15:06.590
Only possible in the ocean.

15:06.750 --> 15:09.982
It doesn’t evaporate the rivers so much as it can

15:10.142 --> 15:12.727
because it’s such a wide thing, such a deep thing,

15:12.887 --> 15:16.042
inexhaustible.

15:16.202 --> 15:23.122
And then absolutely pure material comes out of that,

15:23.745 --> 15:28.120
and that can go and touch the heart.

15:28.280 --> 15:32.163
Because as a Sahaja Yogi those hearts are at a very high level

15:32.323 --> 15:38.101
where there is Shiva residing.

15:38.745 --> 15:43.865
Nobody can reach there except for the purity,

15:44.249 --> 15:48.849
and unless and until you have that largeness,

15:49.041 --> 15:55.580
that depth, that humility, and the maryadas.

15:55.740 --> 16:00.482
You know that sea never leaves its own maryadas,

16:00.642 --> 16:04.762
and if you press it from one end it will express on one other side –

16:04.922 --> 16:06.682
it never leaves.

16:06.842 --> 16:10.602
If Pacific Ocean was

16:10.762 --> 16:15.090
even hundred feet deeper there would have been a problem.

16:15.250 --> 16:21.202
So even in depth, in its height, in its spreading

16:21.362 --> 16:23.250
it has its own maryadas.

16:23.410 --> 16:28.362
But in that maryada he has the feeling

16:28.522 --> 16:32.130
that he is one with the nature, one with Mother.

16:32.290 --> 16:35.939
He is not disturbing the Mother Earth,

16:36.099 --> 16:41.166
nicely placed in the body of Mother Earth.

16:42.865 --> 16:46.722
Nature is bound by the Divine.

16:46.882 --> 16:48.882
The Divine looks after the nature.

16:49.042 --> 16:53.568
So everything works out beautifully and you have freedom.

16:53.728 --> 16:58.228
And after Sahaja Yoga you have greater freedom,

16:59.042 --> 17:03.178
absolute freedom, because you cannot be bound

17:03.338 --> 17:10.562
by anything nonsensical, anything sinful, anything base.

17:10.722 --> 17:16.218
You are above that like a mountain.

17:17.287 --> 17:21.579
And so wherever there is a combination

17:21.739 --> 17:26.940
of a mountain and an ocean, the ships can come.

17:27.976 --> 17:31.394
Deep people can only come to such shores

17:31.554 --> 17:34.249
where there is depth.

17:34.409 --> 17:37.642
That’s how you achieve your depth,

17:37.802 --> 17:44.002
between your Heart and your Bhavasagara,

17:44.290 --> 17:47.675
that beautiful area where people can come to you

17:47.835 --> 17:52.467
and just they know this is something great,

17:56.016 --> 17:59.482
everybody knows that.

17:59.642 --> 18:03.762
You have seen that I am like any other woman to look at.

18:03.922 --> 18:08.616
I don’t know, you might think I am different, but normally…

18:09.209 --> 18:13.242
But how many people come to My program?

18:13.402 --> 18:16.387
How do they come to My program? Must think.

18:16.547 --> 18:21.460
In Colombia when nobody had even heard My name,

18:28.985 --> 18:32.602
thousands came – I mean, very surprising.

18:32.762 --> 18:36.190
And people had no place to sit.

18:36.350 --> 18:39.793
In Russia where, I mean, no question of My, their knowing My name,

18:39.953 --> 18:44.062
there are no books published, nothing.

18:47.002 --> 18:50.122
So you can say that, “Mother,

18:50.282 --> 18:54.984
You manipulate it through the collective unconscious.”

18:55.144 --> 18:59.584
I do not, but it does – I think so.

19:01.162 --> 19:08.387
So when the Sahaja yogis have that content within themselves,

19:08.576 --> 19:12.250
the collective unconscious,

19:12.410 --> 19:18.010
the Divine will act, definitely act.

19:18.962 --> 19:22.482
Like a person who is spreading advertisements,

19:22.642 --> 19:25.922
this that, yes people come.

19:26.082 --> 19:31.242
Because he takes money they think they can purchase this man.

19:31.402 --> 19:33.082
But where there is no money involved,

19:33.242 --> 19:35.770
no business involved, nothing,

19:35.930 --> 19:42.507
you people are just simple people just like them, so?

19:43.449 --> 19:48.209
But it’s all done by the Divine, isn’t it?

19:49.769 --> 19:53.562
So the Divine works it out.

19:53.722 --> 20:00.137
But if the Sahaja yogis in a place are good for nothing,

20:00.297 --> 20:05.489
then even if I am there it does not work.

20:05.649 --> 20:10.009
Half-hearted people if they are it does not work.

20:10.441 --> 20:13.707
In no way to discourage you but to tell you

20:13.867 --> 20:17.513
that you have to develop your content within yourself,

20:17.673 --> 20:21.450
a complete faith in yourself.

20:21.610 --> 20:26.850
This is the greatest property of a Sahaja yogi.

20:28.722 --> 20:30.786
And what is this ocean?

20:30.946 --> 20:35.306
It’s love, it’s love and love.

20:37.402 --> 20:41.885
It doesn’t talk, it doesn’t do much, nothing is to be done in this.

20:42.045 --> 20:44.842
It just works spontaneously.

20:45.002 --> 20:48.482
The less you do the better.

20:49.362 --> 20:53.408
The more you try to do, “I will do this, manipulate there”, no,

20:53.568 --> 20:57.992
you just develop your content within yourself.

21:02.121 --> 21:04.546
And imagine, you are all so lucky,

21:04.706 --> 21:07.633
you have so many provisions which nobody had.

21:07.793 --> 21:11.234
They had to go into jungles, they had to

21:11.394 --> 21:15.249
take all the wrath of their gurus

21:15.409 --> 21:20.005
and nobody to protect them.

21:21.079 --> 21:25.876
And they never had Adi Shakti to worship.

21:28.058 --> 21:30.402
So you have Adi Shakti with you,

21:30.562 --> 21:35.322
whose power is all this Divine.

21:36.191 --> 21:39.922
So you are at such an advantageous position.

21:40.082 --> 21:42.907
But first you must realize.

21:43.067 --> 21:46.962
So when we say we should have content,

21:47.122 --> 21:51.322
then the vessel has to be strong

21:52.073 --> 21:56.562
otherwise everything will break.

21:56.722 --> 22:00.256
And this strength is the one you should know,

22:00.416 --> 22:04.696
that you are completely protected.

22:05.162 --> 22:07.131
No one can harm you.

22:07.291 --> 22:08.418
They’ll try.

22:08.578 --> 22:10.980
This has to be otherwise how will you test

22:11.140 --> 22:14.362
whether you are absolutely safe or not.

22:14.522 --> 22:17.768
So somebody has to try some tricks

22:17.928 --> 22:23.868
just to see and for you to watch how you are successful.

22:24.028 --> 22:26.242
Without doing anything you’ll be amazed,

22:26.402 --> 22:28.428
everything will be cleared out.

22:28.588 --> 22:31.026
And you’ll not know how things have cleared out,

22:31.186 --> 22:34.906
how things have worked out.

22:37.522 --> 22:39.682
So the strength comes.

22:39.842 --> 22:44.222
Again the question is how the strength comes into a Sahaja yogi.

22:44.382 --> 22:48.027
There I would say it’s the shraddha.

22:48.187 --> 22:50.730
Shraddha is not blind faith.

22:50.890 --> 22:54.442
After Sahaja Yoga, after realization

22:54.602 --> 22:57.842
you know everything.

23:00.242 --> 23:02.488
You’ve seen My photographs,

23:02.648 --> 23:05.002
you have seen how Sahaja Yoga works,

23:05.162 --> 23:07.992
you’ve seen how you can raise the Kundalini of people,

23:08.152 --> 23:12.115
you can feel the vibrations;

23:13.897 --> 23:17.313
you can feel others', you can cure others.

23:17.473 --> 23:20.002
All this power is within you.

23:20.162 --> 23:24.002
But just to realize

23:25.000 --> 23:29.602
that power without ego is your strength.

23:29.762 --> 23:32.002
And when you are powerful you don’t have the ego

23:32.162 --> 23:34.338
because what is the need there?

23:34.498 --> 23:38.162
Ego is there only when you don’t have power

23:38.322 --> 23:41.906
because you want to have more, more, more.

23:42.066 --> 23:47.638
But when you are fully there, there’s no ego.

23:47.842 --> 23:52.994
So this power is to be ascertained first,

23:53.154 --> 23:57.322
to find out whether you are powerful or not,

23:57.482 --> 23:59.650
to find out first.

23:59.810 --> 24:02.977
And then, like if I’ve to sit on the chair I’ll see,

24:03.137 --> 24:04.914
“Is it all right or it’s shaking?"

24:05.074 --> 24:08.354
"Oh it’s all right, I can sit on this.”

24:13.941 --> 24:18.322
Some Sahaja yogis still remain on the periphery.

24:18.482 --> 24:24.042
There’s sometimes a very big gap between some

24:24.202 --> 24:27.042
who have reached great heights and some

24:27.202 --> 24:29.802
who are outside.

24:29.962 --> 24:31.882
All these are negative forces

24:32.042 --> 24:35.282
which were killed long time back.

24:39.770 --> 24:44.290
Only one Shakti was sufficient to kill them,

24:45.386 --> 24:50.300
of Kali Shakti, Durga Shakti,

24:50.537 --> 24:54.657
but you have so many of them.

24:55.762 --> 24:58.889
You have Mahalakshmi Shakti,

24:59.049 --> 25:01.396
you’ve got Saraswati Shakti,

25:01.556 --> 25:06.236
you have all the twelve deities are there working for you.

25:11.882 --> 25:18.155
So “realizing it” is the meaning that

25:18.315 --> 25:23.288
you must have complete faith in yourself.

25:23.562 --> 25:27.030
If you still doubt yourself,

25:29.769 --> 25:32.482
that’s also a human quality.

25:32.642 --> 25:35.075
I mean a dog knows that he’s a dog.

25:35.235 --> 25:40.090
He doesn’t doubt that he’s a dog, or a cat, does he?

25:42.202 --> 25:43.842
Or a tiger knows he’s a tiger,

25:44.002 --> 25:46.282
and he knows what capacities he’s got.

25:46.442 --> 25:49.768
It’s only the human beings have got apart from other

25:49.928 --> 25:55.488
stupid qualities is one, this, that they can doubt themselves.

26:01.442 --> 26:08.362
And this doubting quality has made them cowards.

26:08.522 --> 26:14.162
In Sahaja Yoga you should have no doubts about yourself,

26:15.482 --> 26:17.987
“Because I’m doing, still doing like this, Mother,

26:18.147 --> 26:20.945
I am still doing like this, then how?”

26:21.105 --> 26:24.082
Then get rid of it!

26:24.242 --> 26:26.002
I mean, how can I solve your problem

26:26.162 --> 26:28.482
if you want to carry monkey on your back?

26:28.642 --> 26:30.602
And I’m still carrying the monkey on your back.

26:30.762 --> 26:33.002
You get rid of the monkey, finished.

26:33.162 --> 26:35.202
It’s so simple. I mean to My simple logic,

26:35.362 --> 26:38.473
this is what is the answer.

26:38.633 --> 26:41.420
Why do you want to carry the monkey and then come and tell Me,

26:41.580 --> 26:48.272
“Mother, I am carrying the monkey”? I can see it!

26:50.712 --> 26:55.578
Get it off your head! Get it off your back!

26:55.738 --> 27:00.012
It’s very simple, you are a Sahaja yogi.

27:02.656 --> 27:05.519
And this is what I’ve found about Russians.

27:05.679 --> 27:08.482
They didn’t have any monkeys really, very surprising.

27:08.642 --> 27:12.386
I think there are no monkeys at all there.

27:12.762 --> 27:15.334
None of them!

27:16.922 --> 27:21.042
No private problems, no public problems, no any other problem,

27:21.202 --> 27:25.609
nothing, nothing, they discuss nothing.

27:25.769 --> 27:28.199
This is the, they could have said that

27:28.359 --> 27:32.410
“Our government is such, it’s…”, nothing, nothing, nothing.

27:32.570 --> 27:35.202
They had enough of everything, they must have.

27:35.362 --> 27:38.095
Very well-read people, very well-educated,

27:38.255 --> 27:41.664
very big professions, very humble,

27:41.824 --> 27:47.335
very open-hearted; they just wanted realization, that’s all.

27:47.495 --> 27:50.002
They said, “You have come here for our liberation.”

27:50.162 --> 27:52.490
They would even touch My sari like that.

27:52.650 --> 27:56.296
The place I walk they would touch, just imagine.

27:56.456 --> 28:01.772
Who has told them about vibrations? I never said I am Adi Shakti.

28:02.322 --> 28:05.064
How did they recognize Me?

28:05.224 --> 28:10.776
They developed that strength within themselves, that shraddha.

28:10.936 --> 28:13.497
And they never talked about God in that country.

28:13.657 --> 28:15.777
They have some stupid people who have

28:15.937 --> 28:21.607
churches and things like that and Islamic institutions, but

28:21.767 --> 28:25.962
most of the people are so strong

28:26.122 --> 28:29.162
and the content is showing itself.

28:29.322 --> 28:31.762
Imagine every time they have a program,

28:31.922 --> 28:33.522
even now on follow-on,

28:33.682 --> 28:37.922
at least one thousand people are there.

28:40.177 --> 28:45.526
In this England we can’t even get one thousand for Devi Puja.

28:46.282 --> 28:49.040
And they come all the way from thousands of miles,

28:49.200 --> 28:52.162
from Siberia, this, that.

28:52.322 --> 28:53.689
And they have booked themselves,

28:53.849 --> 28:56.602
because there the halls you have to pay for.

28:56.762 --> 28:59.882
So though the Sahaja yogis don’t take money, but they pay for halls.

29:00.042 --> 29:05.072
But the mediocrity to be on the periphery,

29:05.232 --> 29:09.138
not to work it out, take it easy,

29:10.468 --> 29:13.922
not the way for Sahaja Yoga.

29:14.082 --> 29:16.842
We don’t have to kill demons.

29:17.002 --> 29:23.282
There’s no need to join any war

29:23.602 --> 29:29.842
or to fight like soldiers as they fought with Devi, nothing.

29:30.602 --> 29:33.962
You have just to take out the negativity within yourself,

29:34.122 --> 29:38.847
lethargy from you, but work it out.

29:40.962 --> 29:44.887
We say mantras, we know what are the powers of the mantras are,

29:45.047 --> 29:48.362
but you have to keep them awakened.

29:48.522 --> 29:52.962
For that I have told you a hundred times, you must meditate.

29:53.122 --> 29:54.282
Not the way to meditate,

29:54.442 --> 29:56.842
"All right, it’s like playing golf, sort of."

29:57.002 --> 30:02.122
It’s not that way. It’s a serious thing,

30:02.282 --> 30:07.050
you are worshipping the Adi Shakti.

30:07.210 --> 30:13.754
With that complete understanding and dedication

30:14.145 --> 30:19.722
you have to do it; not a mechanical thing, it’s not a game.

30:19.882 --> 30:24.086
It’s something very subtle and special.

30:24.402 --> 30:29.258
In no action we can describe it,

30:29.442 --> 30:37.202
but it’s just a very deep feeling.

30:38.162 --> 30:40.842
To that depth no other feeling goes;

30:41.017 --> 30:44.563
with that feeling you have to meditate.

30:44.723 --> 30:46.671
And then see the results.

30:46.831 --> 30:49.402
Many people say, “I’ve done this, Mother, I’ve done that.

30:49.562 --> 30:51.722
I’ve this still” –

30:51.882 --> 30:57.562
because you are not deep enough.

30:59.155 --> 31:04.042
It’s not how much you pray,

31:04.202 --> 31:08.482
it’s not how many words you use for prayer,

31:08.642 --> 31:13.816
but it is how deeply you have touched

31:15.082 --> 31:23.282
the feet of the Divine that is important.

31:24.122 --> 31:29.317
So today we have to see that

31:29.477 --> 31:36.429
Devi is using Her sword to pierce through our heart

31:38.082 --> 31:41.162
so that all negativity runs away,

31:41.322 --> 31:47.235
and through that She wants to plant the lotus

31:47.395 --> 31:50.435
for Shiva to settle down.

31:50.922 --> 31:56.522
She wants to take away all that ugliness from within.

31:56.682 --> 31:58.882
It’s like an operation

31:59.042 --> 32:03.402
but so delicate and so beautifully done,

32:03.562 --> 32:05.682
you never even felt it.

32:05.842 --> 32:09.802
The other day somebody gave Me a book of on the Devi's

32:09.962 --> 32:13.202
and the vibrations are called as 'spanda' – means 'pulsation'

32:13.362 --> 32:15.522
– it’s correct, no doubt,

32:15.682 --> 32:18.562
and it’s called as 'anahata' in Sanskrit language,

32:18.722 --> 32:21.202
meaning 'without percussions'.

32:21.362 --> 32:23.122
But I was reading that book, I said,

32:23.282 --> 32:27.082
“It’s like going round and round, up and down,

32:27.242 --> 32:29.402
going into ‘this means, that means'."

32:29.602 --> 32:32.522
How can anybody understand this book, it’s so terrible!

32:32.682 --> 32:36.042
While I have said all these things and much more than this,

32:36.202 --> 32:40.242
and they know it so easily.

32:40.402 --> 32:44.922
If you read that book, two pages, you’ll get a headache, I tell you.

32:45.082 --> 32:48.402
But how the whole knowledge of Sahaja Yoga

32:48.562 --> 32:53.202
has come to you so beautifully,

32:54.522 --> 32:58.962
it’s very remarkable, I tell you.

33:02.202 --> 33:07.602
If you read the mantras they’ll give you explanations

33:07.762 --> 33:10.945
which has nothing to do with reality sometimes, I feel.

33:11.105 --> 33:18.065
But even if it has, it’s so circuitous, so complicated.

33:21.630 --> 33:24.683
I would say Adi Shankaracharya realized it and that’s why

33:24.843 --> 33:27.607
He gave up the idea of writing any treatises and,

33:27.767 --> 33:30.162
“Let’s make it simple, the praise of the Mother." Finished.

33:30.322 --> 33:32.522
"If you praise the Mother, everything okay.”

33:32.682 --> 33:35.560
But that’s not. I find that’s not so, it’s easy.

33:35.720 --> 33:37.802
You see, human beings are great experts,

33:37.962 --> 33:40.562
they can be just like radios praising, praising.

33:40.722 --> 33:43.980
Nothing goes inside the heart.

33:47.527 --> 33:51.247
But you have to develop that depth.

33:51.602 --> 33:53.482
In Sahaja Yoga we work through our heart,

33:53.642 --> 33:56.202
not through our brains.

33:56.434 --> 34:00.014
You have to develop that heart

34:02.384 --> 34:10.330
and to receive into it the greatness of other people.

34:12.898 --> 34:18.041
Now people can see what’s wrong with others very easily.

34:18.201 --> 34:21.075
They don’t want to see what’s wrong with them.

34:21.235 --> 34:22.899
Any intelligent man can see that,

34:23.059 --> 34:25.327
there’s no need to have his realization.

34:25.487 --> 34:28.362
But a wise person sees what’s wrong with him

34:28.522 --> 34:31.682
and he trusts. He trusts

34:31.842 --> 34:36.563
himself then because he’s wise.

34:37.818 --> 34:41.617
He doesn’t doubt, he knows he’s wise.

34:41.777 --> 34:45.450
He knows what’s wrong with him and what is to be done.

34:45.610 --> 34:51.554
So the work of the Goddess is very different today,

34:51.714 --> 34:53.681
as you can see it clearly.

34:53.841 --> 34:58.321
Of course, symbolically it is the same

34:58.649 --> 35:02.576
but it has become very subtle, very subtle.

35:02.736 --> 35:07.576
The first work is to destroy the negativity

35:08.002 --> 35:10.025
which is going on as you know.

35:10.185 --> 35:13.321
The more light comes in, the ignorance will disappear.

35:13.481 --> 35:17.127
This light will spread, all the darkness will go away.

35:17.287 --> 35:20.967
But you are the lights.

35:22.233 --> 35:25.442
You have to put the lights on

35:25.794 --> 35:28.090
and you have to look after your light,

35:28.250 --> 35:33.930
and you have to make that light eternal.

35:36.120 --> 35:41.760
This is one work which you are doing.

35:43.722 --> 35:47.202
It’s a beautiful work of the Goddess you are doing

35:47.362 --> 35:52.802
is to spread light, enlighten people.

35:53.082 --> 35:56.602
The negativity that is around you

35:56.762 --> 36:00.562
is not so dangerous as whatever is in you.

36:00.842 --> 36:03.495
Today it has become subtler.

36:03.655 --> 36:06.322
The negativity has become subtler.

36:06.482 --> 36:08.730
It’s entered into your being,

36:08.890 --> 36:13.849
and be careful – it may anytime topple you.

36:17.168 --> 36:19.968
Even one step

36:20.362 --> 36:22.867
you do not put right when you are climbing up,

36:23.027 --> 36:25.547
you can go down.

36:25.896 --> 36:29.707
So one has to be alert, without tension.

36:29.867 --> 36:33.192
You have to be alert without tension.

36:33.352 --> 36:36.922
And the alertness grows.

36:37.082 --> 36:41.474
When the light goes within you start seeing it.

36:41.634 --> 36:44.009
Immediately you see, “Oh, that’s it!

36:44.169 --> 36:48.335
So I, the so and so – that’s it!”

36:48.495 --> 36:53.121
And you know how to correct it and you know how to put it right.

36:53.281 --> 36:54.922
And immediately you take to it.

36:55.082 --> 36:59.762
Like a good sari now has something fallen on it,

36:59.922 --> 37:03.162
immediately you clean it.

37:05.321 --> 37:13.787
In the same way we have to be very, very alert;

37:13.947 --> 37:16.737
'daksha' is the word for that.

37:16.897 --> 37:20.843
Now this was the work of the Goddess before.

37:21.003 --> 37:23.322
Goddess used to give enlightenment

37:23.482 --> 37:26.091
and Goddess used to be alert for you.

37:26.251 --> 37:30.291
She would sit like a tigress for Her children.

37:30.482 --> 37:32.642
They are praying, they are doing puja,

37:32.802 --> 37:37.451
they are doing some sort of a homa, havana,

37:37.611 --> 37:40.439
so the Goddess would sit down, protect them

37:40.599 --> 37:42.858
from all negativity coming,

37:43.018 --> 37:46.151
all rakshasas coming, kill them, this, do that.

37:46.311 --> 37:52.414
But that stage is gone now. Now She’s entered into you.

37:54.042 --> 37:56.408
So you have to kill your negativity,

37:56.568 --> 38:01.350
you’ve become as powerful as your Mother.

38:02.410 --> 38:06.690
No negativity can touch you.

38:07.531 --> 38:12.249
So you can give realization, you’ve got that power very well;

38:12.409 --> 38:18.769
and you can watch your defects more than that of others.

38:19.922 --> 38:23.442
And you try to put them out because they’re not good,

38:23.602 --> 38:27.802
they’re not for your benevolence, they’re not for your ascent.

38:27.962 --> 38:31.305
By that nobody is going to gain.

38:32.127 --> 38:36.355
At the collective level it just works automatically.

38:36.515 --> 38:38.126
You don’t have to worry.

38:38.286 --> 38:42.522
It comes to culmination and a person goes out;

38:42.682 --> 38:46.682
as if somebody runs up like a blind fellow

38:46.842 --> 38:49.562
on a cliff and jumps, jumps down.

38:49.722 --> 38:52.082
You don’t have to worry too much about this.

38:52.242 --> 38:56.982
It just works. You have seen it has worked that way.

39:00.555 --> 39:03.883
Now another quality that you have:

39:04.043 --> 39:06.442
to believe that Goddess is working through you.

39:06.602 --> 39:10.522
In you She resides, you have got the powers,

39:10.682 --> 39:13.202
it’s penetrated into you

39:13.362 --> 39:20.762
is that you can comfort people, you can cure them,

39:22.962 --> 39:28.244
you can give them peace, you can give them bliss.

39:28.569 --> 39:31.722
But then what Goddess has done in you is that

39:31.882 --> 39:36.250
She has given you the bliss, you have become bliss.

39:36.441 --> 39:40.722
Like there’s say a cool air-conditioner,

39:40.882 --> 39:42.282
you get the cool from there.

39:42.442 --> 39:45.282
In the same way if you are emitting bliss,

39:45.442 --> 39:46.762
you give bliss to others.

39:46.922 --> 39:49.402
But there is no bliss within yourself,

39:49.562 --> 39:52.353
but what bliss you can give to others?

39:52.513 --> 39:55.737
So a Sahaja yogi has to be a blissful like the Goddess.

39:55.897 --> 39:57.937
You see She has very extreme characters,

39:58.103 --> 40:02.538
as you must have known that She’s extremely cruel,

40:02.698 --> 40:04.442
She can be very cruel,

40:04.602 --> 40:08.737
and She can be extremely gentle

40:08.897 --> 40:12.724
– like two ragas of yesterday.

40:14.082 --> 40:27.439
She could be extremely harsh, extremely harsh,

40:27.599 --> 40:31.370
beyond all human expectations,

40:31.530 --> 40:37.930
and She could be extremely mild.

40:40.882 --> 40:47.962
So this harsh part you need not have.

40:48.202 --> 40:50.202
It will just work.

40:50.362 --> 40:53.922
This part is only kept for the Divine.

40:54.082 --> 40:56.760
You just take to the other side.

40:56.920 --> 41:00.522
Let this harsh part be looked after by the Divine.

41:00.682 --> 41:02.602
After all, Divine also must do some work.

41:02.762 --> 41:09.962
If you do all the work then what will Divine do?

41:10.538 --> 41:13.896
So the Divine will look after that part.

41:14.056 --> 41:19.232
So you have to enjoy yourself as the Goddess enjoys Herself;

41:19.392 --> 41:21.967
enjoys Her bliss, enjoys Her peace,

41:22.127 --> 41:26.305
enjoys Her everything: Her creation, Her children,

41:26.465 --> 41:29.146
their love – everything She enjoys.

41:29.306 --> 41:32.583
In the same way you have to enjoy.

41:33.802 --> 41:36.402
You have to know about everything,

41:36.562 --> 41:40.468
you have to be absolutely knowledgeable.

41:43.342 --> 41:48.222
And nothing more is needed but just to say that

41:48.382 --> 41:52.102
“Oh Divine, please protect us.”

41:52.262 --> 41:54.710
At the most!

41:54.870 --> 41:58.582
Even if you don’t say it’s all right, you are looked after.

41:58.742 --> 42:00.862
The Divine is working out the stage, you see.

42:01.022 --> 42:05.534
You don’t see it, all there, invisible.

42:05.694 --> 42:07.222
And you are on the stage,

42:07.382 --> 42:09.542
so they are looking out what to focus light,

42:09.702 --> 42:12.302
where to put, what light to put, what is to be done,

42:12.462 --> 42:13.702
what is to be changed around.

42:13.862 --> 42:18.647
Everything they are arranging. You are nicely here.

42:18.807 --> 42:21.087
So you need not do all that work.

42:21.247 --> 42:26.406
You do your work of acting and saying dialogues.

42:26.566 --> 42:31.183
That’s your work. Let them do their jobs, they are doing very well.

42:31.343 --> 42:38.383
They are excellently placed and they are experts.

42:39.255 --> 42:42.589
So to leave certain things into the hands

42:42.749 --> 42:47.931
of the Divine is what we call as 'surrender'.

42:48.582 --> 42:53.526
And that much of this, if done, then

42:53.854 --> 42:57.692
most of your things will work out so miraculously.

42:57.852 --> 43:02.542
I mean, you’ll be amazed, “How, Mother, how it is worked out?

43:02.702 --> 43:07.998
We never expected how things we got it done?”

43:08.158 --> 43:10.518
There’s a very, very big force working:

43:10.678 --> 43:14.142
the Force, the Energy

43:14.302 --> 43:17.359
which is the Source of all the energies,

43:17.519 --> 43:20.456
which has created this great universe,

43:20.616 --> 43:23.896
which has created this Mother Earth, created this sun,

43:24.136 --> 43:27.952
which has created you very delicately.

43:28.112 --> 43:30.752
This Force is working.

43:31.552 --> 43:33.312
And that Force is looking after you,

43:33.472 --> 43:38.991
so proud of you that you have come on the stage now.

43:42.766 --> 43:47.583
So as it is we are today praying to the Goddess that

43:47.743 --> 43:52.083
“Help us to fight our negativity within us.

43:52.327 --> 43:54.472
Give us Your tiger so that we fight,

43:54.632 --> 43:58.232
give us Your lion so we fight.”

43:58.392 --> 44:02.622
Let us fight all these horrible animals that are within us,

44:02.782 --> 44:06.606
these horrible haunting things that are within us,

44:06.766 --> 44:09.135
these horrible conditionings we have.

44:09.295 --> 44:12.358
You have to get rid of it.

44:12.518 --> 44:16.695
Still, still if you watch yourself, lots of conditionings are there,

44:16.855 --> 44:20.272
lots of things, you see. If you see,

44:20.432 --> 44:25.518
there are covered with very thin curtains and you don’t see it,

44:25.712 --> 44:28.326
but they are there.

44:28.486 --> 44:33.238
But let the tiger enter into all these dens and find out.

44:33.398 --> 44:36.029
And you enjoy that, riding over the horse,

44:36.189 --> 44:42.309
riding over the lion, and riding over the tiger

44:42.927 --> 44:45.975
– like a Goddess. Why not?

44:46.135 --> 44:51.592
After all, children get all the heritage of the mother, don’t they?

44:51.766 --> 44:54.952
So you have all the heritage available to you.

44:55.112 --> 44:58.991
But you have to be worthy,

44:59.151 --> 45:03.709
in the sense that you have to know that you are worthy, that’s all.

45:03.869 --> 45:07.322
You have to just know that you are worthy

45:07.482 --> 45:09.962
and that you can do it.

45:10.930 --> 45:16.324
So again today we are here to do this puja,

45:16.962 --> 45:21.995
which would have been in Perth but somehow or other it was not so,

45:22.155 --> 45:26.547
and is luck for you to have this puja.

45:26.707 --> 45:32.258
And it is something of a very deeper nature,

45:32.418 --> 45:36.441
very subtler nature.

45:37.975 --> 45:41.762
Like your blood it is, because on these seven days they say

45:41.922 --> 45:45.205
the Goddess has to wear the red all the time

45:45.365 --> 45:47.642
because it’s blood.

45:47.802 --> 45:52.801
And the first color you see in the womb of your mother is red.

45:52.961 --> 45:57.915
It’s the security. One side is the red rag,

45:58.075 --> 46:01.010
another side it is the security.

46:01.170 --> 46:05.530
So for you it is the security around you.

46:05.690 --> 46:11.565
Every place you go, it is there – just feel it.

46:11.962 --> 46:16.878
You have entered I must say, entered the Kingdom of God,

46:17.038 --> 46:20.314
no doubt about it. You all have entered,

46:20.474 --> 46:22.943
so beautifully you are settled down.

46:23.122 --> 46:26.816
May God bless you.
