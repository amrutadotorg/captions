00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.919
Again, I bow today to the seekers of truth.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.599
From the very beginning, I have to say,

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.960
that I would like to address

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.720
to all those who are really seeking the truth.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.720
I am not going just to read something to you

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:20.440
and give My own interpretation about it.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:32.360
All of you have got sufficient intelligence to read any book you like

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.200
and to have your own interpretation.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.960
We have so many interpretations of the Holy Bible,

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.760
that it is amazing, how people,

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.359
do not understand,

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:57.040
that when they have their own interpretation, it could be wrong!

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:17.960
For example, our great leader in our country,  Mahatma Gandhi, was

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:22.000
once asked by a Christian

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.159
to become a Christian.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.080
He said: "Why don't you become officially a Christian?"

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:42.439
And he laughed aloud and he said: "I would like to, but,

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.120
please, tell me what should I become,

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.960
should be a Catholic or a Protestant

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.440
or I should to be

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.240
another sect of Protestants"?

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.600
Especially the Protestants have so many sects,

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:56.199
like Penticostals, they have got Seventh Day Adventists,

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.640
they have got Methodists, they have...

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:03.040
another one - what is that called as...

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.880
Penta... I mean so many like that.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:27.599
So he asked: "Which one should I join?

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:31.120
If you tell me exactly which one to join, I would like to join."

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.160
And he had no answer to it!

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.440
So, there is some sort of a gap

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:50.600
in the understanding of the Bible, we should know!

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.959
The gap lies because

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:10.600
the first books, of The Old Testament, are not written

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.400
after Christ, but before Christ!

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.760
There was a big controversy, which the Jews put up,

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:35.600
even today in England, saying that

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.319
there was no mention of the "Virgin” in the Old Testament,

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:42.600
but it was written "a girl", not "a Virgin".

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.719
So, they denied this immaculate conception,

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:07.719
because it is not written that it's "a Virgin", but was written

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.479
as "a girl".

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.680
Now, this controversy is stupid.

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:32.000
But no use talking to them, because they won't to listen to Me!

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.240
In Hebrew language there's only one word

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.960
for the virgin and the girl.

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.640
Even in Sanskrit language there's only one word,

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.520
called "kanya" for the virgin.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:04.640
Even "a girl" is the same word as "kanya".

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:10.239
Now, with these things, what they wrote was:

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:14.120
"There will be a virgin, who will give the birth”.

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:24.720
Because logically, why should they write "a girl"?

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:36.280
This is a prophecy so, the word "girl",

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.760
itself suggest

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.680
that there was something special

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.840
about the person who is going to be born!

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:46.400
After all, a child is not going to be born to a man, is it?

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:03.640
Moreover, in modern times, we don’t see any virgins!

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:07.360
Even old women say that they are  girls.

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:21.960
So we don't have to judge,

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.319
according to our modern ideas

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:28.600
about the times when Christ came on this Earth!

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.960
The whole interpretation gets twisted

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.920
when we use our  brains,

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:42.280
which has got a limited quality of intelligence.

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:55.960
When Christ said that, "lt is all accomplished now”,

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.880
it meant something much deeper than

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.920
anyone can understand, who just reads Bible.

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:17.319
It... He didn't say that "everything is accomplished",

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:20.600
He just  said "It is”, despite the fact He was on the cross.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.760
There He said "It is all accomplished”, it.

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:46.880
Because Christ had a special great task to perform.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:15:00.040
He had to be present in a cross

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:04.280
that we have in our brain,

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:23.240
in the Agnya chakra, as you see there.

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:35.600
Now, this Agnya chakra is the one, is a place where

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.280
there is no room,

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:41.200
at all, because the ego and superego are pressing each other.

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:02.720
Because Christ was just the Spirit and not the body,

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:06.560
he had to go in the place where

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:09.640
it is very difficult for any other incarnation to go.

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:30.360
And this is what He said when

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:36.640
He said that "It is all accomplished", means: ”I have now

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:41.600
established Myself in that centre,

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:46.240
which is placed at the cross roads of ego and superego”.

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:14.200
You know that Christ was born at a time

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.280
when there were not at all people

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:19.640
who had any open mind or understanding.

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:30.920
If they had, they would not have crucified Him.

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:38.120
On the cross, when He was there,

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:41.760
was He to tell them about Agnya chakra?

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:53.639
Could he talk to them about these

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.520
chakras and all that to these fishermen,

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:58.280
who were always doubting Him?

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:12.520
Till He got Realisation, they did not....

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.400
Resurrection, they did not believe Him!

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:26.280
Even today, people are not willing to hear Me.

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.080
They have such a stupid barrier,

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:39.920
today also, you can see. They don't want to hear!

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:54.240
So, what about Christ?

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:02.600
Then He did say, that "I will have to send you a Councillor".

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:12.240
He said that, "I'll send to You a Comforter,

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:16.040
who will make you know about My Father for ever".

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:24.480
So, we have to look forward to that.

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:30.920
I do not want to claim

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:33.520
that I am the Counceller or a Comforter or anything,

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:36.520
I am not such a fool to tell you anything about it!

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:54.800
I am very diplomatic about it.

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:04.320
Christ just said that, "I am the light, I am the path", which He is.

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:09.520
And He was the Son of God! Only He said the truth,

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:12.880
which was the truth and is the truth still today!

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:28.600
What wrong did He say, that the Jews crucified Him?

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:39.080
You can't understand these Jews, today even.

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:47.480
But the stage has come now

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:50.240
that we cannot understand also the people,

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:52.320
who are trying  the same tricks

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:55.520
of using a book of Bible,

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:58.240
which they used, Jews, to crucify Christ.

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:23.440
The pharisees in those days -

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:25.760
I know more Hebrew words, because

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.520
I've read the Bible from the Hebrew –

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:31.360
so they were, the people,

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:33.639
who opposed Christ.

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:38.480
The people who thought they were the authorities on Bible.

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:52.520
Now, we have to see in modern times what we are doing.

00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:59.960
Since long, your fathers,

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:02.320
your forefathers and their forefathers

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:06.200
have been going  to church and asking God

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:11.320
to come within them and give them the second birth.

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:33.680
Christ has said very clearly

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:36.640
that you are to be born again, didn't He?

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:47.720
He talked of the future in those terms.

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:55.560
But nobody thinks about it, that we have not been able

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:59.000
to actualize the experience of second birth.

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:20.159
You will be amazed, because of my husband’s job,

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:21.959
I have to travel all over the world.

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:26.040
I have been to Russia and to China and all the communist countries.

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:38.840
And I asked the Russians:

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:41.560
"Why did You refuse Christ?

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:44.400
Why did You refuse Christianity?

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:53.080
So they laughed, they said:

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:55.280
"You are so curious, so we'll take You the place

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.440
where there are Christians".

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:06.960
They had their Orthodox church

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:12.000
of Greece, the Greek Orthodox church they have, in Russia.

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.400
When we went in,

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:21.280
the priest, the head priest received us,

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:24.680
and said that he is fasting these days.

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:36.560
And he doesn't eat any meat these days,

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:39.640
but he can have all kinds of vegetables and fruits.

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:47.840
But when we sat for lunch,

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:50.800
he started smoking one cigarette after another,

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.080
it was impossible for Me to sit there.

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:04.880
He was extremely insecure and nervous man.

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:08.879
Apart from that, he drank and drank and drank, and drank,

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:10.480
in his fasting.

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:18.280
And he lost his balance, you know. We didn’t know where to do!

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:26.960
Then we came out, he didn’t even see this us off,

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:29.680
and then the Russians started laughing; they said:

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:33.800
"Now, did you see the Orthodox Christians?"

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:45.600
He said that, "How we’ve got them here?

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:48.399
Because first the Catholic religion

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:50.080
we thought we'll have,

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:52.960
but they said that "You cannot divorce!” So, we didn’t want them.

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:55.880
Then we wanted to have Islam, they said:

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:58.080
"You cannot drink!” So, we didn’t have them.

00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:00.480
So Orthodox Church came forward - they said:

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:04.080
"You can do everything as long as you give money to the church!”

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:31.720
They asked Me a question:

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:34.240
”Is this what they have learned from Christ?

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:36.640
Was there Christ living anywhere?”

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.960
Then in China,

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:47.480
I asked them: "Why have you denied Christ,

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:49.120
for communism, whatever you have?

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:52.560
Why have you denied Christ and Christianity?"

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:54.120
They said this:

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:58.679
"Christian nations - they came here, doped us,

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:03.440
gave us all kinds of dopes and took away all that we had

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:08.080
and You think that they are in any way good people?"

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:27.200
I had no answer to them!

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:31.800
They said: "With Bible you cannot improve your life,

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:33.680
we can see that clearly.

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.120
They are all aggressors,

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:49.480
very cruel people.

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:54.040
They went all the way to America

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:57.080
to kill all the inhabitants of that country,

00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:59.440
completely finish them off,

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:02.520
and establish their church of Catholicism.

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:28.280
They denounced all the democracies, saying that these democracies

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:31.640
are using God, for their own purpose!

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:57.600
All the communist countries I visited

00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:02.320
have great complaints against all the democracies of the world,

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:05.320
only on one point, that, they use God,

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:10.000
and they haven’t got any good qualities of God in them.

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:37.200
Americans sent some wheat to India.

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:40.040
In that they had such a horrible seed,

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:43.720
that it grew into a grass, which could not be cut

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:46.720
and killed - it starting eating all the fields in India.

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:10.120
Gregoire has seen, how they sent an acacia seed,

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:15.960
which grew into a very thorny, harmful poisonous tree.

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:18.920
If anybody touched - the villagers or children -

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:22.199
they would get blisters on their body for days together

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:24.120
and the body would rotten under that.

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:38.320
Today, Americans are sending

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:43.320
all kinds of weapons, selling them

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:45.480
to all the countries to fight nicely.

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:47.960
Is it Christianity by any chance?

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:03.440
They talk of peace and sell their weapons.

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:07.840
They are selling a medicine, which is forbidden by doctors,

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:12.360
to poor these Bangladeshis, who can be killed by that medicine.

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:35.880
What about England? Under the guidance of Henry VIII,

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:37.520
they came to India:

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:41.800
300 years they lived in that country like parasites!

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:56.480
My father went to jail, my mother went to jail

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:01.600
and the churches drove them out of the Church,

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:03.680
as if Christ was born in England!

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:19.160
And when he became something great, when he came out of the jail,

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:21.120
they were, they were regarded

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:24.399
as "a very great Christian community people”, you see?

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:27.960
Just tell that.

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:31.920
When he become something big in the Constituent Assembly and...

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:46.280
Was Christ born in England?

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:54.880
These are the English today - are the racists of the first waters...

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:04.840
If they were such racists, why did they go to these countries?

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:07.440
To exploit them and loot them.

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:18.000
Indians are too gracious to say anything

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:21.960
the way these people tortured them. They are too gracious

00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:24.120
and forgiving.

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:44.840
Now think of France.

00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:49.280
Christ has said,

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:52.440
"Thou shall not have adulterous eyes”.

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:55.440
Not only adultery, but "adulterous eyes”. He corrected

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:59.720
on what the Bible had said previously in The ten commandments.

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:02.960
"Thou shall not have adulterous eyes”!

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:25.200
What about the French, having no adultery? Imagine, French,

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:28.440
are they anywhere near Christ?

00:34:42.719 --> 00:34:46.000
I´m in your land, Switzerland, as a guest,

00:34:46.199 --> 00:34:50.000
it's not gracious to say some things which I would like to say,

00:34:50.199 --> 00:34:52.799
with due apologies to all of you as Swiss people.

00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:09.160
Which you should not feel bad, because the time has come

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:13.040
for Me to tell you what Swiss people are doing across.

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:30.040
It is a very subtle aggression.

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:34.399
Try to understand.

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:38.360
Say any developing country,

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:42.040
whether it is Pakistan, India or Mauritius,

00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:45.720
or any African country,

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:48.880
when there are people who are dishonest

00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:52.279
and take the - suck the money of these poor people,

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:53.640
who haven't got to eat

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:57.200
they come and put in your banks, and you support this.

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:23.800
All the development plans

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.520
of all these third world countries, are failing,

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:28.399
because there are Swiss banks,

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:31.360
which are supporting all the thugs of the world.

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:51.279
All the fake gurus, who have made money, made people weak,

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:54.680
epileptic, with cancer, all their money

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:57.840
is very nicely stored and kept account

00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:01.320
in secret accounts in your great banks, here.

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:25.319
If you see a starving soul anywhere,

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:28.560
know that you are playing a part through these banks,

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:31.800
in making them to starve and die and suffer!

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:54.400
So, just by reading Bible,

00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:57.600
what emancipation and resurrection are you going to give -

00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:59.960
people which Christ preached?

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:15.920
For Me, Christ is My life

00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:18.160
and Bible is the Truth.

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:25.279
But it does not mean, that in these four years,

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:27.200
Christ could talk to these

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:29.920
brainless people anything about Kundalini!

00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:43.360
There is only one thing,

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:46.440
for which we should be thankful to all the democracies,

00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:48.960
that they can’t crucify Me now.

00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:05.400
It is you, the Christians, have to rise to the occasion,

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:09.080
and should find out, what’s wrong in the whole system,

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:13.560
that we claim something, we profess something, but we are not that.

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:31.520
Why do we compromise?

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:35.120
And why do we accept such things, which are wrong,

00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:38.480
within ourselves, within our states, within our democracies?

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:52.560
One should know that falsehood will fall one day.

00:39:57.240 --> 00:40:01.000
But Christ is not false and Bible is not false.

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:05.879
It will not fall, it is an eternal thing!

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:12.840
But to understand it, you have to be a subtler being.

00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:22.440
Why Christ said that you should be born again,

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:27.279
because without that happening, you cannot understand Christ!

00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:37.400
If your faith in Bible is

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:41.160
because  you have bought a book and you have studied and mastered it,

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:43.440
then, it is of no use.

00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:57.160
Now, one must understand,

00:40:57.360 --> 00:41:01.480
that if you do not open your eyes to what Christ has said,

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:04.279
that you are to be born again,

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:08.320
the young people, who are thinking, not stupid people

00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:11.160
I’m saying, but young people, who are thinking,

00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:14.480
will defy and deny God.

00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:33.920
I’ve met many young people, who came - Christians -

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:36.480
came to Me and they said: "We have no faith in Christ.

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:38.240
Don't talk of Him, we are fed up.

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:48.200
Thousands and thousands I must say.

00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:56.359
So many people got up when I started talking about Christ

00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:57.560
in America.

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:12.400
So now, one has to realize, that I am here,

00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:15.360
to prove the existence of Christ!

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:23.520
And to prove every word of Bible!

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:28.640
I do not have faith in Bible,

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:32.880
it is my life, it is everything to Me!

00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:39.120
It’s a truth for Me.

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:46.359
But, one must know, that by reading,

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:49.200
you do not become a true Christian.

00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:57.800
You are to be born again!

00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:03.560
And how you do it and how it has to work out,

00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:06.640
that I have come to explain on this earth.

00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:17.760
Look at the attention of people.

00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:21.400
When there was a funny boy who came and just said

00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:23.839
"Christ, Christ, Christ", like that - everybody has said that -

00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:28.279
there were people from the television and everyone wanted to

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:30.720
record that incident.

00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:54.440
But when I told them there was a lady,

00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:56.319
who got cured of her deafness,

00:43:56.520 --> 00:44:00.360
a long deafness, in ten minutes, they would not record  that!

00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:17.200
We have here somebody

00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:20.280
who was on crutches for 45 years, and he's walking about,

00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:24.520
perfectly all right - nobody would like to see that!

00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:27.720
SY - The one who came to see You?
SM - No, no, our Brian.

00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:47.200
In England, hundreds of

00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:50.400
people have, given up their drugs addiction -

00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:52.839
nobody wants to see that either.

00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:18.359
In India, thousands of people gave up at their alcohol,

00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:19.880
their criminal habits,

00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:22.520
and they have improved their lives, have become so beautiful,

00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:26.759
they are so happy citizens today - no one wants to see that either.

00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:47.120
I don’t mind if they are blind, let them be blind.

00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:49.840
But don’t lead others into blindness!

00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:02.439
This I had to explain, because first of all,

00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:04.960
I did not know, they had booked this hall,

00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:06.960
these boys. They booked this hall.

00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:08.840
Tell them.

00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:27.080
And I felt, that so far,

00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:29.480
I’ve never talked to Protestants

00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:31.960
in Switzerland or anywhere,

00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:34.240
except in America, who are not even

00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:37.120
Christians now, because they don’t believe in Christianity.

00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:40.160
So might be it is the desire of the God,

00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:43.360
that I should talk to Protestants, that they should not protest

00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:45.720
Christ, when He comes on this Earth.

00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:19.880
A simple question I want to ask all those who believe

00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:23.279
that they have faith in Christ and faith in Bible.

00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:36.160
When Christ will come, how will you recognise Him that He's Christ?

00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:47.080
Face this problem directly!

00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:53.640
Because you do not know, it's not written in the Bible.

00:47:56.720 --> 00:48:00.839
Even His Name is not given, in what Name He is going to come.

00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:08.600
But when He will come on this Earth,

00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:12.360
He is not going to council you or comfort you or redeem you.

00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:25.320
He is going to just slash out the people and sort them out

00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:27.560
who are useless, for the Kingdom of God!

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.680
All these powers are within you.

00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:48.240
Your Spirit is within you.

00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:55.440
Spirit is the absolute thing.

00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:01.080
Unless and until you get to the Spirit,

00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:05.120
you cannot live in the world of relativity, it's relative.

00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:14.160
Because it is relative,

00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:17.960
that’s why whatever you interpret, is manyfold.

00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:27.319
The Islamic people today, who come to Sahaja Yoga - we have

00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:30.400
people here from Algeria, who are Muslims -

00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:33.560
have starting believing in Christ.

00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:49.680
The Jews who,

00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:53.720
who have denied Christ, have now starting accepting Christ.

00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:57.160
And worshipping Him!

00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:05.240
Hindus also accept Christ, not because I have

00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:08.720
tried to give them a brainwashing or some bread.

00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:24.960
Those who are not believers of God,

00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:28.319
also have started  believing in Christ.

00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:38.960
So, what is happening?

00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:40.200
Why?

00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:43.800
When there is darkness,

00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:51.280
for you, the seat that you’re occupying is the reality.

00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:00.640
Somebody is standing next to this lamp post -

00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:02.480
for him this is the reality.

00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:13.279
Because, first, they are blind, another there is darkness.

00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:20.520
But when light comes in,

00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:24.799
you see everything and you see the correlation of each other.

00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:33.720
Now, why did they accept Christ?

00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:42.560
When the Kundalini rises,

00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:47.320
this primordial force rises through these centers,

00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:52.040
it comes up to the point here, where you see this red mark.

00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:03.520
This is just the window of that center,

00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:08.000
which is placed between the optic chiasma,

00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:11.680
controlling the pituitary and the pineal body.

00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:25.279
That is "the door", "the gate", Christ has described.

00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:32.439
Then the Kundalini stops - of these people.

00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:42.640
And also of Christians, because they have done unauthorized work.

00:52:56.320 --> 00:53:01.560
Then one has to open this center, by taking the name of Christ.

00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:15.320
And also, Mary, His power.

00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:23.680
In Sahaja Yoga, Mary is the Incarnation of the Holy Ghost.

00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:41.920
My father, who was a scholar of Sanskrit and

00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:45.880
fourteen languages, who translated Quran Sharif into Hindi,

00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:50.480
told Me, that people try to deny

00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:54.720
Christ’s Mother, because the Muslims would not accept.

00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:30.560
When Christ was dying,

00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:33.560
then He said, "Behold the Mother!”

00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:46.320
He did not say: "Look after My mother".

00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:51.960
He was too great a Man

00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:54.720
to think of just a mother, who gave Him birth!

00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:06.840
But He said " Behold the Mother!"

00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:14.759
It means that "You look at Her!

00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:18.520
Watch Her! See Her! Understand Her!"

00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:28.880
After His death, Mary had a very, very bad time.

00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:36.160
She had to go to India, where She died.

00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:41.400
Because the people,

00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:43.440
who were supposed to behold Her,

00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:47.879
were missing completly and even today nobody wants to behold!

00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:02.040
Now, this rising of the Kundalini takes place.

00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:04.880
It is quite shocking for people,

00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:07.360
who have never heard a word of Kundalini.

00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:24.600
Much before that Christ came on this Earth,

00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:26.240
as I told you yesterday,

00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:28.680
He is described very well

00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:32.080
fourteen thousands years back in Indian Scriptures, believe Me!

00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:39.960
You don't want to believe in that,

00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:43.600
because You want to use this Bible, for your purpose!

00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:54.040
Anybody who writes about Christ,

00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:58.399
is taken over in the Bible, isn't it ?

00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:01.120
Like the disciples -

00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:03.480
they wrote about Christ. Christ never wrote Bible!

00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:14.640
But then why did You have St. Paul there,

00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:16.640
who never even saw Christ?

00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:27.400
Because he said he saw a cross?

00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:32.160
Does that mean that he has ability to write about Christianity

00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:34.440
and Christ, that he should be in the Bible?

00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:48.120
Why people did not raise any objection to him, but they raise to Me?

00:57:57.960 --> 00:57:59.920
The reason is obvious.

00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:04.400
Because it helps certain purposes!

00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:09.759
I am for one purpose here:

00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:13.760
to give you what you have.

00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:22.080
In Switzerland you’ll understand better, if I say

00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:27.360
that I am like a banker, who has to cash your cheques.

00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:40.080
If somebody says that to you, will you be angry with that person?

00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:42.799
SY - If, if somebody says...

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.520
SM: that to you, that I have to cash your cheques,

00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:48.480
will you be angry with that person?

00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:02.360
You will not be!

00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:06.480
If I say I have a diamond to offer you,

00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:09.160
will you go and consult Bible about it?

00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:21.880
No, because our attention

00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:26.080
is more for material things, not for the spiritual.

00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:36.080
But not so, I would say,

00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:40.240
because I have met very, very beautiful people and seekers,

00:59:40.440 --> 00:59:44.920
all over the world,  who are really seeking the truth!

00:59:57.040 --> 01:00:00.480
And yesterday also we had such beautiful people,

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:05.640
sitting down here, who were just asking for the truth!

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:16.200
When you become Realized Soul,

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:19.080
you have your own powers.

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:26.120
Your power of love manifests itself!

01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:34.200
It is a tremendous thing, that is a human being, do you know that?

01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:46.240
All these centers represent your steps of evolution,

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:52.919
of your awareness.

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:58.800
And once you have come to the human level,

01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:01.640
you have to just jump into,

01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:10.960
into the unconscious,

01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:19.000
where we say, it is the Kingdom of God.

01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:28.200
You'll be amazed that Sahaja Yoga relates God to science.

01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:39.720
We have many scientific people,

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:42.800
who are doing research in different areas,

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.960
doctors and  PHD's,

01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:50.960
who are understanding science through Sahaja Yoga.

01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:15.880
It is fantastic!

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:18.000
Because you are fantastic!

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:22.759
God has created you, with great care

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:26.520
and love and has made you a human being,

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:30.279
to give all His love and all His kingdom and all His powers to you

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:31.480
to enjoy!

01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:47.359
He has not made you to suffer

01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:53.480
and to kill each other and hate each other

01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:01.640
and to live in the

01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:06.200
in the perpetual insecurity from other human beings!

01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:18.280
He has not made you to prepare the weapons of distruction!

01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:26.600
He has made you to enjoy His construction, which is so subtle

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:29.600
and is already for you.

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:43.960
So give up all your fasting and sufferings and torturing,

01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:53.279
all your fears and depressions,

01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:57.760
all your maladies!

01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:00.920
Because once the Spirit is enlighten within you,

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:09.560
in that light, you immediately arrive in the Kingdom of God.

01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:17.080
I say this to you, that, "Please, listen to Me!" -

01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:25.439
because later on, you will say that, "Mother, You never told us!"

01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:32.160
It's going to be very serious.

01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:37.680
So, please, be alert about it

01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:41.240
and just take your Resurrection!

01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:52.080
I have not to take from you anything!

01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:58.720
I have come to give you something.

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:05.640
The eternal life, that is promised.

01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:08.840
So why should you be angry with Me?

01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:14.840
What did I say to make you angry?

01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:21.040
I am not here for election,

01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:23.759
that I will go on pleasing in your wrong things!

01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:39.680
You have to elect Me in a way, that you elect your loving people.

01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:48.000
Not with anger.

01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:49.960
SY - Not?
SM - Not with anger,

01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:51.600
but with understanding.

01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:02.160
Not with barriers of conditioning, of what you have read.

01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:08.520
Not with your ego, which is agressive.

01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:13.520
But with a silent understanding.

01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:21.839
If you have this property within you, why shoudn't you have it?

01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:28.960
Already Gregoire has told you

01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:31.319
about these different chakras and all that,

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:34.120
and tomorrow I will explain to you in the morning

01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:38.400
all about the different centers and about the different...

01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:42.759
powers within us, and how by our neglect we cause

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:45.680
maladjustment and so we get

01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:48.160
emotional, physical and mental maladies.

01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:18.759
I'll also tell you how to cure yourself and how to cure others,

01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:22.800
with precise understanding, scientific understanding.

01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:35.520
And day after tomorrow morning, I will tell you

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:37.920
how to achieve your detachment

01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:40.520
from your physical, mental and emotional self

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:43.439
and established completely into Sahaja Yoga.

01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:07.480
Now, today, we will have again a session of Realization.

01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:14.200
There is no need for you to believe in Me,

01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:16.440
but as long as you do not deny Me,

01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:22.120
you can sit here and please, listen to Me what I say.

01:08:22.319 --> 01:08:27.240
As a Mother, I request you, to do justice to yourself!

01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:45.400
And don't be obstinate about anything!

01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:53.640
I know it is a new knowledge for most of the people

01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:56.480
who have not read anything else

01:08:56.680 --> 01:09:00.640
but, I know of many young people,

01:09:01.479 --> 01:09:03.799
of western countries,

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.240
who have reached the conclusion,

01:09:06.439 --> 01:09:08.559
that it is the Kundalini awakening, is the saving.

01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:11.240
Even Gregoire did the same.

01:09:36.279 --> 01:09:37.719
Everyone should try.

01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:39.600
If do you not want it,

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:43.480
I cannot force it, otherwise it's very difficult, otherwise.

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:44.960
So you can leave!

01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:47.599
Will be better for Me, if you don't want it,

01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:52.920
it's better that you leave, and leave the rest with their work.

01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:09.960
That...

01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:13.040
That would be very civil and kind of you,

01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:27.440
to leave others to have their experiences.

01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:31.120
If you do not want to have, don’t have "dog in the manger" policy.

01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:51.640
So...

01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:55.480
thank you!
