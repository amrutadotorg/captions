06:46.080 --> 06:50.919
Again, I bow today to the seekers of truth.

06:55.200 --> 06:58.599
From the very beginning, I have to say,

06:58.800 --> 07:01.960
that I would like to address

07:02.160 --> 07:05.720
to all those who are really seeking the truth.

07:12.680 --> 07:16.720
I am not going just to read something to you

07:16.920 --> 07:20.440
and give My own interpretation about it.

07:27.600 --> 07:32.360
All of you have got sufficient intelligence to read any book you like

07:32.560 --> 07:35.200
and to have your own interpretation.

07:43.680 --> 07:46.960
We have so many interpretations of the Holy Bible,

07:47.200 --> 07:50.760
that it is amazing, how people,

07:50.960 --> 07:52.359
do not understand,

07:52.560 --> 07:57.040
that when they have their own interpretation, it could be wrong!

08:13.800 --> 08:17.960
For example, our great leader in our country,  Mahatma Gandhi, was

08:18.160 --> 08:22.000
once asked by a Christian

08:22.200 --> 08:24.159
to become a Christian.

08:24.360 --> 08:27.080
He said: "Why don't you become officially a Christian?"

08:38.799 --> 08:42.439
And he laughed aloud and he said: "I would like to, but,

08:42.640 --> 08:44.120
please, tell me what should I become,

08:44.320 --> 08:45.960
should be a Catholic or a Protestant

08:46.200 --> 08:47.440
or I should to be

08:47.640 --> 08:50.240
another sect of Protestants"?

08:50.440 --> 08:52.600
Especially the Protestants have so many sects,

08:52.800 --> 08:56.199
like Penticostals, they have got Seventh Day Adventists,

08:56.400 --> 08:58.640
they have got Methodists, they have...

08:58.840 --> 09:03.040
another one - what is that called as...

09:03.240 --> 09:05.880
Penta... I mean so many like that.

09:24.800 --> 09:27.599
So he asked: "Which one should I join?

09:27.800 --> 09:31.120
If you tell me exactly which one to join, I would like to join."

09:38.160 --> 09:40.160
And he had no answer to it!

09:45.120 --> 09:47.440
So, there is some sort of a gap

09:47.640 --> 09:50.600
in the understanding of the Bible, we should know!

10:01.920 --> 10:04.959
The gap lies because

10:05.200 --> 10:10.600
the first books, of The Old Testament, are not written

10:10.800 --> 10:13.400
after Christ, but before Christ!

10:28.200 --> 10:31.760
There was a big controversy, which the Jews put up,

10:31.960 --> 10:35.600
even today in England, saying that

10:35.800 --> 10:39.319
there was no mention of the "Virgin” in the Old Testament,

10:39.520 --> 10:42.600
but it was written "a girl", not "a Virgin".

11:00.920 --> 11:03.719
So, they denied this immaculate conception,

11:03.920 --> 11:07.719
because it is not written that it's "a Virgin", but was written

11:07.920 --> 11:09.479
as "a girl".

11:20.160 --> 11:23.680
Now, this controversy is stupid.

11:27.920 --> 11:32.000
But no use talking to them, because they won't to listen to Me!

11:38.200 --> 11:41.240
In Hebrew language there's only one word

11:41.440 --> 11:43.960
for the virgin and the girl.

11:50.520 --> 11:53.640
Even in Sanskrit language there's only one word,

11:53.840 --> 11:55.520
called "kanya" for the virgin.

12:00.640 --> 12:04.640
Even "a girl" is the same word as "kanya".

12:06.680 --> 12:10.239
Now, with these things, what they wrote was:

12:10.440 --> 12:14.120
"There will be a virgin, who will give the birth”.

12:20.840 --> 12:24.720
Because logically, why should they write "a girl"?

12:33.040 --> 12:36.280
This is a prophecy so, the word "girl",

12:36.480 --> 12:37.760
itself suggest

12:37.960 --> 12:39.680
that there was something special

12:39.880 --> 12:41.840
about the person who is going to be born!

12:42.080 --> 12:46.400
After all, a child is not going to be born to a man, is it?

13:00.320 --> 13:03.640
Moreover, in modern times, we don’t see any virgins!

13:03.840 --> 13:07.360
Even old women say that they are  girls.

13:19.640 --> 13:21.960
So we don't have to judge,

13:22.160 --> 13:24.319
according to our modern ideas

13:24.520 --> 13:28.600
about the times when Christ came on this Earth!

13:33.200 --> 13:35.960
The whole interpretation gets twisted

13:36.160 --> 13:37.920
when we use our  brains,

13:38.160 --> 13:42.280
which has got a limited quality of intelligence.

13:51.880 --> 13:55.960
When Christ said that, "lt is all accomplished now”,

13:56.160 --> 13:58.880
it meant something much deeper than

13:59.080 --> 14:01.920
anyone can understand, who just reads Bible.

14:13.520 --> 14:17.319
It... He didn't say that "everything is accomplished",

14:17.520 --> 14:20.600
He just  said "It is”, despite the fact He was on the cross.

14:20.800 --> 14:23.760
There He said "It is all accomplished”, it.

14:39.240 --> 14:46.880
Because Christ had a special great task to perform.

14:55.200 --> 15:00.040
He had to be present in a cross

15:00.240 --> 15:04.280
that we have in our brain,

15:20.200 --> 15:23.240
in the Agnya chakra, as you see there.

15:31.360 --> 15:35.600
Now, this Agnya chakra is the one, is a place where

15:35.800 --> 15:37.280
there is no room,

15:37.480 --> 15:41.200
at all, because the ego and superego are pressing each other.

15:58.880 --> 16:02.720
Because Christ was just the Spirit and not the body,

16:02.920 --> 16:06.560
he had to go in the place where

16:06.760 --> 16:09.640
it is very difficult for any other incarnation to go.

16:27.360 --> 16:30.360
And this is what He said when

16:30.560 --> 16:36.640
He said that "It is all accomplished", means: ”I have now

16:36.840 --> 16:41.600
established Myself in that centre,

16:41.800 --> 16:46.240
which is placed at the cross roads of ego and superego”.

17:10.880 --> 17:14.200
You know that Christ was born at a time

17:14.400 --> 17:16.280
when there were not at all people

17:16.480 --> 17:19.640
who had any open mind or understanding.

17:27.720 --> 17:30.920
If they had, they would not have crucified Him.

17:35.680 --> 17:38.120
On the cross, when He was there,

17:38.320 --> 17:41.760
was He to tell them about Agnya chakra?

17:50.840 --> 17:53.639
Could he talk to them about these

17:53.840 --> 17:55.520
chakras and all that to these fishermen,

17:55.720 --> 17:58.280
who were always doubting Him?

18:10.040 --> 18:12.520
Till He got Realisation, they did not....

18:12.720 --> 18:15.400
Resurrection, they did not believe Him!

18:22.400 --> 18:26.280
Even today, people are not willing to hear Me.

18:35.200 --> 18:37.080
They have such a stupid barrier,

18:37.280 --> 18:39.920
today also, you can see. They don't want to hear!

18:51.160 --> 18:54.240
So, what about Christ?

18:58.320 --> 19:02.600
Then He did say, that "I will have to send you a Councillor".

19:09.480 --> 19:12.240
He said that, "I'll send to You a Comforter,

19:12.440 --> 19:16.040
who will make you know about My Father for ever".

19:21.640 --> 19:24.480
So, we have to look forward to that.

19:28.680 --> 19:30.920
I do not want to claim

19:31.120 --> 19:33.520
that I am the Counceller or a Comforter or anything,

19:33.720 --> 19:36.520
I am not such a fool to tell you anything about it!

19:51.160 --> 19:54.800
I am very diplomatic about it.

20:00.200 --> 20:04.320
Christ just said that, "I am the light, I am the path", which He is.

20:04.520 --> 20:09.520
And He was the Son of God! Only He said the truth,

20:09.720 --> 20:12.880
which was the truth and is the truth still today!

20:24.840 --> 20:28.600
What wrong did He say, that the Jews crucified Him?

20:34.960 --> 20:39.080
You can't understand these Jews, today even.

20:45.400 --> 20:47.480
But the stage has come now

20:47.680 --> 20:50.240
that we cannot understand also the people,

20:50.440 --> 20:52.320
who are trying  the same tricks

20:52.520 --> 20:55.520
of using a book of Bible,

20:55.720 --> 20:58.240
which they used, Jews, to crucify Christ.

21:20.400 --> 21:23.440
The pharisees in those days -

21:23.640 --> 21:25.760
I know more Hebrew words, because

21:25.960 --> 21:27.520
I've read the Bible from the Hebrew –

21:27.720 --> 21:31.360
so they were, the people,

21:31.560 --> 21:33.639
who opposed Christ.

21:33.840 --> 21:38.480
The people who thought they were the authorities on Bible.

21:48.680 --> 21:52.520
Now, we have to see in modern times what we are doing.

21:57.680 --> 21:59.960
Since long, your fathers,

22:00.160 --> 22:02.320
your forefathers and their forefathers

22:02.520 --> 22:06.200
have been going  to church and asking God

22:06.400 --> 22:11.320
to come within them and give them the second birth.

22:31.280 --> 22:33.680
Christ has said very clearly

22:33.880 --> 22:36.640
that you are to be born again, didn't He?

22:44.680 --> 22:47.720
He talked of the future in those terms.

22:51.400 --> 22:55.560
But nobody thinks about it, that we have not been able

22:55.760 --> 22:59.000
to actualize the experience of second birth.

23:16.320 --> 23:20.159
You will be amazed, because of my husband’s job,

23:20.360 --> 23:21.959
I have to travel all over the world.

23:22.160 --> 23:26.040
I have been to Russia and to China and all the communist countries.

23:36.920 --> 23:38.840
And I asked the Russians:

23:39.040 --> 23:41.560
"Why did You refuse Christ?

23:41.760 --> 23:44.400
Why did You refuse Christianity?

23:51.480 --> 23:53.080
So they laughed, they said:

23:53.280 --> 23:55.280
"You are so curious, so we'll take You the place

23:55.480 --> 23:57.440
where there are Christians".

24:04.320 --> 24:06.960
They had their Orthodox church

24:07.160 --> 24:12.000
of Greece, the Greek Orthodox church they have, in Russia.

24:16.400 --> 24:18.400
When we went in,

24:18.600 --> 24:21.280
the priest, the head priest received us,

24:21.480 --> 24:24.680
and said that he is fasting these days.

24:33.200 --> 24:36.560
And he doesn't eat any meat these days,

24:36.760 --> 24:39.640
but he can have all kinds of vegetables and fruits.

24:45.840 --> 24:47.840
But when we sat for lunch,

24:48.040 --> 24:50.800
he started smoking one cigarette after another,

24:51.000 --> 24:53.080
it was impossible for Me to sit there.

25:02.200 --> 25:04.880
He was extremely insecure and nervous man.

25:05.080 --> 25:08.879
Apart from that, he drank and drank and drank, and drank,

25:09.080 --> 25:10.480
in his fasting.

25:14.640 --> 25:18.280
And he lost his balance, you know. We didn’t know where to do!

25:24.040 --> 25:26.960
Then we came out, he didn’t even see this us off,

25:27.160 --> 25:29.680
and then the Russians started laughing; they said:

25:29.880 --> 25:33.800
"Now, did you see the Orthodox Christians?"

25:43.240 --> 25:45.600
He said that, "How we’ve got them here?

25:45.800 --> 25:48.399
Because first the Catholic religion

25:48.600 --> 25:50.080
we thought we'll have,

25:50.280 --> 25:52.960
but they said that "You cannot divorce!” So, we didn’t want them.

25:53.160 --> 25:55.880
Then we wanted to have Islam, they said:

25:56.080 --> 25:58.080
"You cannot drink!” So, we didn’t have them.

25:58.280 --> 26:00.480
So Orthodox Church came forward - they said:

26:00.680 --> 26:04.080
"You can do everything as long as you give money to the church!”

26:28.880 --> 26:31.720
They asked Me a question:

26:31.920 --> 26:34.240
”Is this what they have learned from Christ?

26:34.440 --> 26:36.640
Was there Christ living anywhere?”

26:43.000 --> 26:44.960
Then in China,

26:45.160 --> 26:47.480
I asked them: "Why have you denied Christ,

26:47.680 --> 26:49.120
for communism, whatever you have?

26:49.320 --> 26:52.560
Why have you denied Christ and Christianity?"

26:52.760 --> 26:54.120
They said this:

26:54.320 --> 26:58.679
"Christian nations - they came here, doped us,

26:58.880 --> 27:03.440
gave us all kinds of dopes and took away all that we had

27:03.640 --> 27:08.080
and You think that they are in any way good people?"

27:25.040 --> 27:27.200
I had no answer to them!

27:29.280 --> 27:31.800
They said: "With Bible you cannot improve your life,

27:32.040 --> 27:33.680
we can see that clearly.

27:43.200 --> 27:45.120
They are all aggressors,

27:46.800 --> 27:49.480
very cruel people.

27:49.680 --> 27:54.040
They went all the way to America

27:54.240 --> 27:57.080
to kill all the inhabitants of that country,

27:57.280 --> 27:59.440
completely finish them off,

27:59.640 --> 28:02.520
and establish their church of Catholicism.

28:24.920 --> 28:28.280
They denounced all the democracies, saying that these democracies

28:28.480 --> 28:31.640
are using God, for their own purpose!

28:54.880 --> 28:57.600
All the communist countries I visited

28:57.800 --> 29:02.320
have great complaints against all the democracies of the world,

29:02.520 --> 29:05.320
only on one point, that, they use God,

29:05.520 --> 29:10.000
and they haven’t got any good qualities of God in them.

29:34.480 --> 29:37.200
Americans sent some wheat to India.

29:37.400 --> 29:40.040
In that they had such a horrible seed,

29:40.240 --> 29:43.720
that it grew into a grass, which could not be cut

29:43.920 --> 29:46.720
and killed - it starting eating all the fields in India.

30:06.920 --> 30:10.120
Gregoire has seen, how they sent an acacia seed,

30:10.320 --> 30:15.960
which grew into a very thorny, harmful poisonous tree.

30:16.200 --> 30:18.920
If anybody touched - the villagers or children -

30:19.120 --> 30:22.199
they would get blisters on their body for days together

30:22.400 --> 30:24.120
and the body would rotten under that.

30:36.440 --> 30:38.320
Today, Americans are sending

30:38.520 --> 30:43.320
all kinds of weapons, selling them

30:43.520 --> 30:45.480
to all the countries to fight nicely.

30:45.680 --> 30:47.960
Is it Christianity by any chance?

31:00.800 --> 31:03.440
They talk of peace and sell their weapons.

31:03.640 --> 31:07.840
They are selling a medicine, which is forbidden by doctors,

31:08.040 --> 31:12.360
to poor these Bangladeshis, who can be killed by that medicine.

31:31.400 --> 31:35.880
What about England? Under the guidance of Henry VIII,

31:36.080 --> 31:37.520
they came to India:

31:37.720 --> 31:41.800
300 years they lived in that country like parasites!

31:53.480 --> 31:56.480
My father went to jail, my mother went to jail

31:59.160 --> 32:01.600
and the churches drove them out of the Church,

32:01.800 --> 32:03.680
as if Christ was born in England!

32:15.920 --> 32:19.160
And when he became something great, when he came out of the jail,

32:19.360 --> 32:21.120
they were, they were regarded

32:21.320 --> 32:24.399
as "a very great Christian community people”, you see?

32:26.520 --> 32:27.960
Just tell that.

32:28.160 --> 32:31.920
When he become something big in the Constituent Assembly and...

32:43.960 --> 32:46.280
Was Christ born in England?

32:49.880 --> 32:54.880
These are the English today - are the racists of the first waters...

33:01.400 --> 33:04.840
If they were such racists, why did they go to these countries?

33:05.040 --> 33:07.440
To exploit them and loot them.

33:15.280 --> 33:18.000
Indians are too gracious to say anything

33:18.240 --> 33:21.960
the way these people tortured them. They are too gracious

33:22.160 --> 33:24.120
and forgiving.

33:41.480 --> 33:44.840
Now think of France.

33:46.840 --> 33:49.280
Christ has said,

33:49.480 --> 33:52.440
"Thou shall not have adulterous eyes”.

33:52.640 --> 33:55.440
Not only adultery, but "adulterous eyes”. He corrected

33:55.640 --> 33:59.720
on what the Bible had said previously in The ten commandments.

33:59.920 --> 34:02.960
"Thou shall not have adulterous eyes”!

34:21.280 --> 34:25.200
What about the French, having no adultery? Imagine, French,

34:25.400 --> 34:28.440
are they anywhere near Christ?

34:42.719 --> 34:46.000
I´m in your land, Switzerland, as a guest,

34:46.199 --> 34:50.000
it's not gracious to say some things which I would like to say,

34:50.199 --> 34:52.799
with due apologies to all of you as Swiss people.

35:05.320 --> 35:09.160
Which you should not feel bad, because the time has come

35:09.360 --> 35:13.040
for Me to tell you what Swiss people are doing across.

35:27.400 --> 35:30.040
It is a very subtle aggression.

35:32.720 --> 35:34.399
Try to understand.

35:36.040 --> 35:38.360
Say any developing country,

35:38.560 --> 35:42.040
whether it is Pakistan, India or Mauritius,

35:42.240 --> 35:45.720
or any African country,

35:45.920 --> 35:48.880
when there are people who are dishonest

35:49.080 --> 35:52.279
and take the - suck the money of these poor people,

35:52.480 --> 35:53.640
who haven't got to eat

35:53.840 --> 35:57.200
they come and put in your banks, and you support this.

36:21.760 --> 36:23.800
All the development plans

36:24.000 --> 36:26.520
of all these third world countries, are failing,

36:26.720 --> 36:28.399
because there are Swiss banks,

36:28.600 --> 36:31.360
which are supporting all the thugs of the world.

36:47.040 --> 36:51.279
All the fake gurus, who have made money, made people weak,

36:51.480 --> 36:54.680
epileptic, with cancer, all their money

36:54.880 --> 36:57.840
is very nicely stored and kept account

36:58.040 --> 37:01.320
in secret accounts in your great banks, here.

37:22.240 --> 37:25.319
If you see a starving soul anywhere,

37:25.520 --> 37:28.560
know that you are playing a part through these banks,

37:28.760 --> 37:31.800
in making them to starve and die and suffer!

37:52.400 --> 37:54.400
So, just by reading Bible,

37:54.600 --> 37:57.600
what emancipation and resurrection are you going to give -

37:57.800 --> 37:59.960
people which Christ preached?

38:13.520 --> 38:15.920
For Me, Christ is My life

38:16.120 --> 38:18.160
and Bible is the Truth.

38:22.240 --> 38:25.279
But it does not mean, that in these four years,

38:25.480 --> 38:27.200
Christ could talk to these

38:27.400 --> 38:29.920
brainless people anything about Kundalini!

38:41.840 --> 38:43.360
There is only one thing,

38:43.560 --> 38:46.440
for which we should be thankful to all the democracies,

38:46.640 --> 38:48.960
that they can’t crucify Me now.

39:01.560 --> 39:05.400
It is you, the Christians, have to rise to the occasion,

39:05.600 --> 39:09.080
and should find out, what’s wrong in the whole system,

39:09.280 --> 39:13.560
that we claim something, we profess something, but we are not that.

39:28.720 --> 39:31.520
Why do we compromise?

39:31.720 --> 39:35.120
And why do we accept such things, which are wrong,

39:35.320 --> 39:38.480
within ourselves, within our states, within our democracies?

39:48.800 --> 39:52.560
One should know that falsehood will fall one day.

39:57.240 --> 40:01.000
But Christ is not false and Bible is not false.

40:03.200 --> 40:05.879
It will not fall, it is an eternal thing!

40:09.360 --> 40:12.840
But to understand it, you have to be a subtler being.

40:19.120 --> 40:22.440
Why Christ said that you should be born again,

40:22.640 --> 40:27.279
because without that happening, you cannot understand Christ!

40:34.920 --> 40:37.400
If your faith in Bible is

40:37.600 --> 40:41.160
because  you have bought a book and you have studied and mastered it,

40:41.360 --> 40:43.440
then, it is of no use.

40:55.080 --> 40:57.160
Now, one must understand,

40:57.360 --> 41:01.480
that if you do not open your eyes to what Christ has said,

41:01.680 --> 41:04.279
that you are to be born again,

41:04.480 --> 41:08.320
the young people, who are thinking, not stupid people

41:08.520 --> 41:11.160
I’m saying, but young people, who are thinking,

41:11.360 --> 41:14.480
will defy and deny God.

41:30.600 --> 41:33.920
I’ve met many young people, who came - Christians -

41:34.120 --> 41:36.480
came to Me and they said: "We have no faith in Christ.

41:36.680 --> 41:38.240
Don't talk of Him, we are fed up.

41:46.040 --> 41:48.200
Thousands and thousands I must say.

41:53.120 --> 41:56.359
So many people got up when I started talking about Christ

41:56.560 --> 41:57.560
in America.

42:08.560 --> 42:12.400
So now, one has to realize, that I am here,

42:12.600 --> 42:15.360
to prove the existence of Christ!

42:19.520 --> 42:23.520
And to prove every word of Bible!

42:26.480 --> 42:28.640
I do not have faith in Bible,

42:28.840 --> 42:32.880
it is my life, it is everything to Me!

42:37.240 --> 42:39.120
It’s a truth for Me.

42:41.680 --> 42:46.359
But, one must know, that by reading,

42:46.560 --> 42:49.200
you do not become a true Christian.

42:55.920 --> 42:57.800
You are to be born again!

42:59.960 --> 43:03.560
And how you do it and how it has to work out,

43:03.760 --> 43:06.640
that I have come to explain on this earth.

43:15.400 --> 43:17.760
Look at the attention of people.

43:17.960 --> 43:21.400
When there was a funny boy who came and just said

43:21.600 --> 43:23.839
"Christ, Christ, Christ", like that - everybody has said that -

43:24.040 --> 43:28.279
there were people from the television and everyone wanted to

43:28.480 --> 43:30.720
record that incident.

43:51.680 --> 43:54.440
But when I told them there was a lady,

43:54.640 --> 43:56.319
who got cured of her deafness,

43:56.520 --> 44:00.360
a long deafness, in ten minutes, they would not record  that!

44:15.480 --> 44:17.200
We have here somebody

44:17.400 --> 44:20.280
who was on crutches for 45 years, and he's walking about,

44:20.480 --> 44:24.520
perfectly all right - nobody would like to see that!

44:24.720 --> 44:27.720
SY - The one who came to see You?
SM - No, no, our Brian.

44:45.280 --> 44:47.200
In England, hundreds of

44:47.400 --> 44:50.400
people have, given up their drugs addiction -

44:50.600 --> 44:52.839
nobody wants to see that either.

45:14.680 --> 45:18.359
In India, thousands of people gave up at their alcohol,

45:18.560 --> 45:19.880
their criminal habits,

45:20.080 --> 45:22.520
and they have improved their lives, have become so beautiful,

45:22.720 --> 45:26.759
they are so happy citizens today - no one wants to see that either.

45:44.480 --> 45:47.120
I don’t mind if they are blind, let them be blind.

45:47.320 --> 45:49.840
But don’t lead others into blindness!

45:59.720 --> 46:02.439
This I had to explain, because first of all,

46:02.640 --> 46:04.960
I did not know, they had booked this hall,

46:05.160 --> 46:06.960
these boys. They booked this hall.

46:07.840 --> 46:08.840
Tell them.

46:24.400 --> 46:27.080
And I felt, that so far,

46:27.280 --> 46:29.480
I’ve never talked to Protestants

46:29.680 --> 46:31.960
in Switzerland or anywhere,

46:32.160 --> 46:34.240
except in America, who are not even

46:34.440 --> 46:37.120
Christians now, because they don’t believe in Christianity.

46:37.320 --> 46:40.160
So might be it is the desire of the God,

46:40.360 --> 46:43.360
that I should talk to Protestants, that they should not protest

46:43.560 --> 46:45.720
Christ, when He comes on this Earth.

47:16.120 --> 47:19.880
A simple question I want to ask all those who believe

47:20.080 --> 47:23.279
that they have faith in Christ and faith in Bible.

47:31.560 --> 47:36.160
When Christ will come, how will you recognise Him that He's Christ?

47:44.600 --> 47:47.080
Face this problem directly!

47:50.760 --> 47:53.640
Because you do not know, it's not written in the Bible.

47:56.720 --> 48:00.839
Even His Name is not given, in what Name He is going to come.

48:06.080 --> 48:08.600
But when He will come on this Earth,

48:08.800 --> 48:12.360
He is not going to council you or comfort you or redeem you.

48:21.280 --> 48:25.320
He is going to just slash out the people and sort them out

48:25.520 --> 48:27.560
who are useless, for the Kingdom of God!

48:40.000 --> 48:42.680
All these powers are within you.

48:46.200 --> 48:48.240
Your Spirit is within you.

48:52.520 --> 48:55.440
Spirit is the absolute thing.

48:58.480 --> 49:01.080
Unless and until you get to the Spirit,

49:01.280 --> 49:05.120
you cannot live in the world of relativity, it's relative.

49:12.320 --> 49:14.160
Because it is relative,

49:14.400 --> 49:17.960
that’s why whatever you interpret, is manyfold.

49:23.680 --> 49:27.319
The Islamic people today, who come to Sahaja Yoga - we have

49:27.520 --> 49:30.400
people here from Algeria, who are Muslims -

49:30.600 --> 49:33.560
have starting believing in Christ.

49:48.400 --> 49:49.680
The Jews who,

49:49.880 --> 49:53.720
who have denied Christ, have now starting accepting Christ.

49:55.640 --> 49:57.160
And worshipping Him!

50:00.880 --> 50:05.240
Hindus also accept Christ, not because I have

50:05.440 --> 50:08.720
tried to give them a brainwashing or some bread.

50:21.760 --> 50:24.960
Those who are not believers of God,

50:25.200 --> 50:28.319
also have started  believing in Christ.

50:36.400 --> 50:38.960
So, what is happening?

50:39.160 --> 50:40.200
Why?

50:42.320 --> 50:43.800
When there is darkness,

50:45.840 --> 50:51.280
for you, the seat that you’re occupying is the reality.

50:57.960 --> 51:00.640
Somebody is standing next to this lamp post -

51:00.840 --> 51:02.480
for him this is the reality.

51:09.240 --> 51:13.279
Because, first, they are blind, another there is darkness.

51:18.560 --> 51:20.520
But when light comes in,

51:20.720 --> 51:24.799
you see everything and you see the correlation of each other.

51:30.520 --> 51:33.720
Now, why did they accept Christ?

51:39.760 --> 51:42.560
When the Kundalini rises,

51:42.760 --> 51:47.320
this primordial force rises through these centers,

51:47.520 --> 51:52.040
it comes up to the point here, where you see this red mark.

51:59.760 --> 52:03.520
This is just the window of that center,

52:03.720 --> 52:08.000
which is placed between the optic chiasma,

52:08.200 --> 52:11.680
controlling the pituitary and the pineal body.

52:22.160 --> 52:25.279
That is "the door", "the gate", Christ has described.

52:29.240 --> 52:32.439
Then the Kundalini stops - of these people.

52:38.800 --> 52:42.640
And also of Christians, because they have done unauthorized work.

52:56.320 --> 53:01.560
Then one has to open this center, by taking the name of Christ.

53:11.040 --> 53:15.320
And also, Mary, His power.

53:18.800 --> 53:23.680
In Sahaja Yoga, Mary is the Incarnation of the Holy Ghost.

53:38.440 --> 53:41.920
My father, who was a scholar of Sanskrit and

53:42.120 --> 53:45.880
fourteen languages, who translated Quran Sharif into Hindi,

53:46.080 --> 53:50.480
told Me, that people try to deny

53:50.680 --> 53:54.720
Christ’s Mother, because the Muslims would not accept.

54:27.240 --> 54:30.560
When Christ was dying,

54:30.760 --> 54:33.560
then He said, "Behold the Mother!”

54:42.400 --> 54:46.320
He did not say: "Look after My mother".

54:50.120 --> 54:51.960
He was too great a Man

54:52.160 --> 54:54.720
to think of just a mother, who gave Him birth!

55:04.360 --> 55:06.840
But He said " Behold the Mother!"

55:11.240 --> 55:14.759
It means that "You look at Her!

55:14.960 --> 55:18.520
Watch Her! See Her! Understand Her!"

55:24.960 --> 55:28.880
After His death, Mary had a very, very bad time.

55:33.320 --> 55:36.160
She had to go to India, where She died.

55:39.920 --> 55:41.400
Because the people,

55:41.600 --> 55:43.440
who were supposed to behold Her,

55:43.640 --> 55:47.879
were missing completly and even today nobody wants to behold!

55:58.200 --> 56:02.040
Now, this rising of the Kundalini takes place.

56:02.280 --> 56:04.880
It is quite shocking for people,

56:05.080 --> 56:07.360
who have never heard a word of Kundalini.

56:20.960 --> 56:24.600
Much before that Christ came on this Earth,

56:24.800 --> 56:26.240
as I told you yesterday,

56:26.440 --> 56:28.680
He is described very well

56:28.880 --> 56:32.080
fourteen thousands years back in Indian Scriptures, believe Me!

56:37.880 --> 56:39.960
You don't want to believe in that,

56:40.160 --> 56:43.600
because You want to use this Bible, for your purpose!

56:51.360 --> 56:54.040
Anybody who writes about Christ,

56:54.240 --> 56:58.399
is taken over in the Bible, isn't it ?

56:59.640 --> 57:01.120
Like the disciples -

57:01.320 --> 57:03.480
they wrote about Christ. Christ never wrote Bible!

57:12.280 --> 57:14.640
But then why did You have St. Paul there,

57:14.840 --> 57:16.640
who never even saw Christ?

57:24.960 --> 57:27.400
Because he said he saw a cross?

57:27.600 --> 57:32.160
Does that mean that he has ability to write about Christianity

57:32.360 --> 57:34.440
and Christ, that he should be in the Bible?

57:43.720 --> 57:48.120
Why people did not raise any objection to him, but they raise to Me?

57:57.960 --> 57:59.920
The reason is obvious.

58:01.320 --> 58:04.400
Because it helps certain purposes!

58:07.160 --> 58:09.759
I am for one purpose here:

58:11.840 --> 58:13.760
to give you what you have.

58:19.240 --> 58:22.080
In Switzerland you’ll understand better, if I say

58:22.280 --> 58:27.360
that I am like a banker, who has to cash your cheques.

58:35.400 --> 58:40.080
If somebody says that to you, will you be angry with that person?

58:41.160 --> 58:42.799
SY - If, if somebody says...

58:43.000 --> 58:45.520
SM: that to you, that I have to cash your cheques,

58:45.720 --> 58:48.480
will you be angry with that person?

59:00.280 --> 59:02.360
You will not be!

59:03.720 --> 59:06.480
If I say I have a diamond to offer you,

59:06.680 --> 59:09.160
will you go and consult Bible about it?

59:19.040 --> 59:21.880
No, because our attention

59:22.080 --> 59:26.080
is more for material things, not for the spiritual.

59:34.280 --> 59:36.080
But not so, I would say,

59:36.280 --> 59:40.240
because I have met very, very beautiful people and seekers,

59:40.440 --> 59:44.920
all over the world,  who are really seeking the truth!

59:57.040 --> 01:00:00.480
And yesterday also we had such beautiful people,

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:05.640
sitting down here, who were just asking for the truth!

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:16.200
When you become Realized Soul,

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:19.080
you have your own powers.

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:26.120
Your power of love manifests itself!

01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:34.200
It is a tremendous thing, that is a human being, do you know that?

01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:46.240
All these centers represent your steps of evolution,

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:52.919
of your awareness.

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:58.800
And once you have come to the human level,

01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:01.640
you have to just jump into,

01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:10.960
into the unconscious,

01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:19.000
where we say, it is the Kingdom of God.

01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:28.200
You'll be amazed that Sahaja Yoga relates God to science.

01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:39.720
We have many scientific people,

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:42.800
who are doing research in different areas,

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.960
doctors and  PHD's,

01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:50.960
who are understanding science through Sahaja Yoga.

01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:15.880
It is fantastic!

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:18.000
Because you are fantastic!

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:22.759
God has created you, with great care

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:26.520
and love and has made you a human being,

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:30.279
to give all His love and all His kingdom and all His powers to you

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:31.480
to enjoy!

01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:47.359
He has not made you to suffer

01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:53.480
and to kill each other and hate each other

01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:01.640
and to live in the

01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:06.200
in the perpetual insecurity from other human beings!

01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:18.280
He has not made you to prepare the weapons of distruction!

01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:26.600
He has made you to enjoy His construction, which is so subtle

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:29.600
and is already for you.

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:43.960
So give up all your fasting and sufferings and torturing,

01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:53.279
all your fears and depressions,

01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:57.760
all your maladies!

01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:00.920
Because once the Spirit is enlighten within you,

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:09.560
in that light, you immediately arrive in the Kingdom of God.

01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:17.080
I say this to you, that, "Please, listen to Me!" -

01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:25.439
because later on, you will say that, "Mother, You never told us!"

01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:32.160
It's going to be very serious.

01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:37.680
So, please, be alert about it

01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:41.240
and just take your Resurrection!

01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:52.080
I have not to take from you anything!

01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:58.720
I have come to give you something.

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:05.640
The eternal life, that is promised.

01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:08.840
So why should you be angry with Me?

01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:14.840
What did I say to make you angry?

01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:21.040
I am not here for election,

01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:23.759
that I will go on pleasing in your wrong things!

01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:39.680
You have to elect Me in a way, that you elect your loving people.

01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:48.000
Not with anger.

01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:49.960
SY - Not?
SM - Not with anger,

01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:51.600
but with understanding.

01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:02.160
Not with barriers of conditioning, of what you have read.

01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:08.520
Not with your ego, which is agressive.

01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:13.520
But with a silent understanding.

01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:21.839
If you have this property within you, why shoudn't you have it?

01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:28.960
Already Gregoire has told you

01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:31.319
about these different chakras and all that,

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:34.120
and tomorrow I will explain to you in the morning

01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:38.400
all about the different centers and about the different...

01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:42.759
powers within us, and how by our neglect we cause

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:45.680
maladjustment and so we get

01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:48.160
emotional, physical and mental maladies.

01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:18.759
I'll also tell you how to cure yourself and how to cure others,

01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:22.800
with precise understanding, scientific understanding.

01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:35.520
And day after tomorrow morning, I will tell you

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:37.920
how to achieve your detachment

01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:40.520
from your physical, mental and emotional self

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:43.439
and established completely into Sahaja Yoga.

01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:07.480
Now, today, we will have again a session of Realization.

01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:14.200
There is no need for you to believe in Me,

01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:16.440
but as long as you do not deny Me,

01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:22.120
you can sit here and please, listen to Me what I say.

01:08:22.319 --> 01:08:27.240
As a Mother, I request you, to do justice to yourself!

01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:45.400
And don't be obstinate about anything!

01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:53.640
I know it is a new knowledge for most of the people

01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:56.480
who have not read anything else

01:08:56.680 --> 01:09:00.640
but, I know of many young people,

01:09:01.479 --> 01:09:03.799
of western countries,

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.240
who have reached the conclusion,

01:09:06.439 --> 01:09:08.559
that it is the Kundalini awakening, is the saving.

01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:11.240
Even Gregoire did the same.

01:09:36.279 --> 01:09:37.719
Everyone should try.

01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:39.600
If do you not want it,

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:43.480
I cannot force it, otherwise it's very difficult, otherwise.

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:44.960
So you can leave!

01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:47.599
Will be better for Me, if you don't want it,

01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:52.920
it's better that you leave, and leave the rest with their work.

01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:09.960
That...

01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:13.040
That would be very civil and kind of you,

01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:27.440
to leave others to have their experiences.

01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:31.120
If you do not want to have, don’t have "dog in the manger" policy.

01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:51.640
So...

01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:55.480
thank you!
