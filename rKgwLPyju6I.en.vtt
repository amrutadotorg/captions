00:00:05.993 --> 00:00:11.648
Marriage is meant to give joy,

00:00:11.728 --> 00:00:17.111
is meant to give cheerfulness, happiness

00:00:17.191 --> 00:00:24.599
and all the blissful things
that we can think of achieving

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:34.853
through our combination with
two human beings, we can say.

00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:42.930
It's a very close and private relationship

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.093
which has to be respected.

00:00:46.173 --> 00:00:51.859
It is not to be in any way dishonored

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:56.196
or indiscreetly squandered away.

00:00:56.971 --> 00:01:01.014
Those who cannot respect their partners in life

00:01:01.094 --> 00:01:04.617
will never be respected anywhere else.

00:01:05.384 --> 00:01:11.260
Those who ill-treat or in any way

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.527
try to spoil the image of their partners

00:01:16.607 --> 00:01:19.561
are harming themselves.

00:01:19.641 --> 00:01:23.712
Try to understand each other,

00:01:23.792 --> 00:01:26.065
decorate each other,

00:01:26.145 --> 00:01:30.924
not correction, but decorating. Like an ornament,

00:01:31.004 --> 00:01:36.142
when added to a personality decorates that person,

00:01:36.222 --> 00:01:39.346
in the same way, try to decorate another person.

00:01:39.426 --> 00:01:43.267
So the decorum and decency of life

00:01:43.347 --> 00:01:46.306
comes from this auspicious relationship.

00:01:46.386 --> 00:01:48.963
That must be maintained.

00:01:49.043 --> 00:01:52.927
Marriage is the bondage that keeps the society

00:01:53.007 --> 00:01:58.960
in its own beautiful bondage of Mother's grace.

00:02:03.085 --> 00:02:07.959
Give up all your old ideas,

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:16.226
all your so-called modern methods

00:02:16.306 --> 00:02:20.087
by which we have ruined our married lives.

00:02:20.167 --> 00:02:25.568
If you cannot enjoy your
own wife or your own husband,

00:02:25.648 --> 00:02:28.086
there's nothing in this world you can enjoy,

00:02:28.166 --> 00:02:33.447
because the relationship is the
most intimate and very sacred.

00:02:33.527 --> 00:02:37.910
So you have to forget that you live independently,

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:44.474
now you live as one person, one personality,

00:02:44.554 --> 00:02:49.227
supporting energy,

00:02:49.307 --> 00:02:53.361
complimenting each other in complete concord.

00:02:53.441 --> 00:02:57.885
This creates that peace
which we are talking about.

00:02:57.965 --> 00:03:01.861
If the marriages are not
successful of two persons,

00:03:01.941 --> 00:03:07.246
how do we expect the whole
nation to live happily? Think of it.

00:03:07.326 --> 00:03:13.371
At this level, the seeds of peace are sown.

00:03:13.451 --> 00:03:17.624
So we have to be sensible people,
that's the main part of marriage is:

00:03:17.704 --> 00:03:21.510
how far we are sensible about it.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.225
It's easy to get into tantrums, get into tempers,

00:03:26.305 --> 00:03:32.979
to get into some sort of an
indecent, indiscreet habit.

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:36.114
But the person who is sensible

00:03:36.194 --> 00:03:39.567
never crosses a certain limit of that decency.

00:03:39.647 --> 00:03:43.772
Once you cross it, it is very easy to cross again.

00:03:44.452 --> 00:03:47.550
That's what today when we read about Rama

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.855
is that He is a maryada purushottam.

00:03:50.935 --> 00:03:54.157
Maryada is the boundary
in which one has to remain.

00:03:54.237 --> 00:03:56.463
A woman has to remain in her boundary

00:03:56.543 --> 00:03:59.727
and a man has to remain in his boundary.

00:03:59.807 --> 00:04:02.355
Now to think that the woman is dominated by man

00:04:02.435 --> 00:04:04.249
or man is dominated by woman

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:09.188
comes from a kind of a complex
and this complex must be given up.

00:04:09.268 --> 00:04:13.435
You are complimentary to each other.

00:04:13.515 --> 00:04:15.564
You decorate each other.

00:04:15.644 --> 00:04:21.433
Never talk ill of your husbands
and never talk ill of your wives.

00:04:22.149 --> 00:04:27.832
This is the key of having
an exclusive married life.

00:04:27.912 --> 00:04:31.378
If you start talking of each other to others,

00:04:31.458 --> 00:04:35.355
that exclusiveness, that trust is finished.

00:04:35.435 --> 00:04:40.858
So you have to trust each other. The trust in God,

00:04:40.938 --> 00:04:46.585
children imbibe when they
start learning from their parents

00:04:46.665 --> 00:04:49.407
how they trust each other.

00:04:49.487 --> 00:04:56.508
So you are the nest where the
tomorrow's great children are to be born,

00:04:56.588 --> 00:05:01.813
to be established and to grow as great saints.
