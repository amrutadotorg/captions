00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.500
Today it's a different day,

00:01:41.496 --> 00:01:45.289
altogether, for all of you

00:01:45.872 --> 00:01:50.080
because,

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.039
this is the Puja of Adi Shakti.

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:02.455
And Adi Shakti is the Complete Personality.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.400
It's not only,

00:02:08.455 --> 00:02:10.872
the left side that you know.

00:02:11.663 --> 00:02:14.205
You all know only the left side,

00:02:14.997 --> 00:02:16.663
from Shri Ganesha,

00:02:20.205 --> 00:02:21.788
through the ascent,

00:02:22.997 --> 00:02:27.205
of different different Chakras, on the left side.

00:02:28.455 --> 00:02:31.538
I didn't want to tell you about the right side,

00:02:32.413 --> 00:02:33.580
to begin with,

00:02:35.205 --> 00:02:39.164
because those who have gone through the right side,

00:02:39.788 --> 00:02:41.580
got just lost.

00:02:46.538 --> 00:02:48.830
They got Gayatri Mantra,

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:55.621
from the, writings.

00:02:57.289 --> 00:03:00.080
But they didn't know what it was about.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.913
They just used to learn it by heart.

00:03:08.538 --> 00:03:11.455
They didn't also know the real meaning of it,

00:03:13.122 --> 00:03:15.455
and that is how they moved,

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.621
on the right side,

00:03:20.496 --> 00:03:24.621
and - I dont know - they landed up at the Agnya.

00:03:28.413 --> 00:03:30.413
And then they were trying

00:03:30.663 --> 00:03:32.788
for the Self Realisation.

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:34.913
They were promised

00:03:35.205 --> 00:03:37.997
that if you do this right side properly,

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:41.913
you will reach,

00:03:43.205 --> 00:03:46.039
to the ultimate goal of Self Realisation.

00:03:47.496 --> 00:03:49.538
But none of them reached yet.

00:03:50.705 --> 00:03:53.872
Most of them got into a terrible temper,

00:03:54.872 --> 00:03:56.455
terrible temper,

00:03:56.872 --> 00:03:58.538
of cursing others,

00:03:59.205 --> 00:04:00.955
of destroying others,

00:04:01.621 --> 00:04:04.039
all these things they learnt,

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.289
through their right side movement.

00:04:11.496 --> 00:04:14.080
There was no Kundalini awakening.

00:04:15.164 --> 00:04:16.913
And they were made,

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.830
to go up to the,

00:04:21.122 --> 00:04:22.872
at the most Agnya Chakra.

00:04:24.122 --> 00:04:27.122
And then they collapsed into different,

00:04:28.205 --> 00:04:31.122
places of complete ignorance.

00:04:34.955 --> 00:04:37.330
All these books were written,

00:04:40.705 --> 00:04:42.621
without understanding,

00:04:43.538 --> 00:04:47.413
that's not easy to go via right side.

00:04:49.455 --> 00:04:51.455
But best was,

00:04:53.205 --> 00:04:55.371
to awaken your Kundalini.

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.580
The Kundalini directly takes you up

00:04:59.872 --> 00:05:01.872
- in the center of all the Chakras,

00:05:02.872 --> 00:05:05.997
up to the Agnya and crosses Agnya,

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.039
and goes beyond Agnya

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.788
into the Sahasrara.

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.788
And then it pierces through the Sahasrara.

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:20.496
Now what is so important about the Brahmarandra

00:05:21.122 --> 00:05:22.955
from where it pierces?

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.496
I never told you about it.

00:05:27.205 --> 00:05:30.830
But now I think, for most of you the time has come.

00:05:32.997 --> 00:05:34.872
You see in the childhood,

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.455
the child has a Thalu,

00:05:38.705 --> 00:05:41.371
is the fontanel bone area,

00:05:41.621 --> 00:05:43.747
which is pulsating always.

00:05:44.371 --> 00:05:46.122
It is pulsating,

00:05:46.538 --> 00:05:48.872
because the Spirit entered

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:50.997
through that area,

00:05:52.663 --> 00:05:54.997
and, when you close it,

00:05:55.788 --> 00:05:57.913
it settles in the Heart.

00:06:00.455 --> 00:06:02.580
Now you have to become,

00:06:03.913 --> 00:06:06.080
the Spirit orientated person.

00:06:06.705 --> 00:06:12.872
But how to enter, into the Sahastrara, was the problem.

00:06:14.955 --> 00:06:16.997
The tantricas who were there

00:06:17.164 --> 00:06:19.289
they went through the right-left side [ie left side],

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.830
and they developed all the practices,

00:06:23.164 --> 00:06:29.621
of black, we should say, the left side.

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.830
So the right sided became extremely hot tempered,

00:06:35.705 --> 00:06:41.872
extremely hot tempered I should say extremely ambitious,

00:06:42.621 --> 00:06:44.039
ferocious,

00:06:46.205 --> 00:06:49.413
and they started killing people

00:06:50.705 --> 00:06:54.289
on the basis of cursing.

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:57.080
They are very good at cursing people,

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:00.580
to be always forward,

00:07:01.455 --> 00:07:03.289
push back all the people,

00:07:04.164 --> 00:07:07.955
and override everybody'ss rights.

00:07:08.747 --> 00:07:10.455
They were regarded

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:15.039
as the most, ambitious and most, powerful people.

00:07:16.205 --> 00:07:18.205
Now the brahmins,

00:07:19.413 --> 00:07:22.080
and to some extent the shatriyas,

00:07:23.039 --> 00:07:25.247
they took the right side.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:27.747
Because of the right side,

00:07:28.164 --> 00:07:30.455
they became very powerful no doubt.

00:07:31.289 --> 00:07:34.289
They got all the powers over the world,

00:07:34.872 --> 00:07:36.247
and eh[a/e sound],

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:41.496
they were regarded as extremely,

00:07:42.621 --> 00:07:45.913
powerful and majestic people - but they were not.

00:07:46.747 --> 00:07:48.747
Because they were so hot tempered.

00:07:49.371 --> 00:07:52.955
Hot tempered people cannot be spiritual.

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:55.997
So they were told "you'll get your spirituality

00:07:56.247 --> 00:07:57.955
don't worry keep moving, "

00:07:58.413 --> 00:08:02.580
and the seven, Chakras were described,

00:08:03.705 --> 00:08:05.371
on the right side.

00:08:07.289 --> 00:08:10.496
According to them there is Bhuh,

00:08:11.747 --> 00:08:13.289
Bhuvah.

00:08:14.205 --> 00:08:18.164
Bhuh is this, butri[? putri/bhutri/phutri], is this world -Bhuh.

00:08:18.913 --> 00:08:24.496
Bhurvah is the complete, Cosmos or we can call it Antariksha.

00:08:25.705 --> 00:08:27.913
Swaha.

00:08:28.164 --> 00:08:30.830
Swaha is consumption at the Nabhi Chakra.

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:33.955
And Swadha, is the,

00:08:34.247 --> 00:08:36.580
Swadha is the consumption,

00:08:37.371 --> 00:08:40.289
inside - is to, absorption.

00:08:41.371 --> 00:08:43.455
Swaha, Swadha.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.205
Then is the minya [? meyengya]

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:48.830
-heart.

00:08:49.747 --> 00:08:51.455
Manah.

00:08:55.872 --> 00:08:58.164
After Manah

00:08:58.872 --> 00:09:07.247
came, the Agnya. The Vishuddi.

00:09:07.705 --> 00:09:10.330
The Vishuddi is Janah

00:09:11.205 --> 00:09:13.663
collectivity, people,

00:09:14.039 --> 00:09:16.039
go to the people.

00:09:16.663 --> 00:09:18.496
Janah.

00:09:19.788 --> 00:09:23.872
Then, at the Agnya it is Tapah.

00:09:25.872 --> 00:09:28.080
In Tapah we have,

00:09:29.164 --> 00:09:31.330
Christ in the center.

00:09:32.788 --> 00:09:34.997
Left side,

00:09:35.413 --> 00:09:37.455
they had,

00:09:38.205 --> 00:09:39.705
Jainism,

00:09:39.997 --> 00:09:42.330
right side Christianity.

00:09:44.621 --> 00:09:48.289
They were not actually ascending path.

00:09:49.164 --> 00:09:54.580
They were, just side, outlets you can say,

00:09:55.247 --> 00:10:00.955
for the energy, of people who were trying, to seek the truth.

00:10:04.747 --> 00:10:11.122
Now this, happened, for ages in India.

00:10:12.122 --> 00:10:14.122
All the gurus, all the sadhus,

00:10:15.455 --> 00:10:18.205
all the big tapaswis, all of them did this.

00:10:18.872 --> 00:10:20.955
But where did they reach?

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:23.621
Tapaswis were the people,

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:27.371
who could give, curses,

00:10:27.621 --> 00:10:30.580
kshu - sharp, to people.

00:10:30.788 --> 00:10:32.580
They could curse somebody.

00:10:33.621 --> 00:10:39.164
With the, kathakshay [? sanscrit] is with the glance of the eye

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:41.580
they could kill somebody,

00:10:42.122 --> 00:10:43.997
they could burn something,

00:10:44.455 --> 00:10:47.455
all right sided powers they had.

00:10:47.913 --> 00:10:50.455
But with these right sided powers

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:52.663
where did they reach?

00:10:53.788 --> 00:10:56.663
To Hell I should say in a way - if not,

00:10:56.913 --> 00:10:59.496
in the limbo as you call it.

00:11:01.205 --> 00:11:04.663
There nobody got self realisation.

00:11:05.788 --> 00:11:10.621
You read, the old books from India,

00:11:11.247 --> 00:11:15.330
but even otherwise, the Greeks..

00:11:17.371 --> 00:11:20.621
And then we had Egyptians.

00:11:22.205 --> 00:11:23.455
English.

00:11:24.788 --> 00:11:28.247
And all kinds of, aggressive people.

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:31.371
Germans.

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:34.538
All of them were aggressive.

00:11:35.538 --> 00:11:37.205
Catholics.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:42.080
And also, you had Romans.

00:11:42.705 --> 00:11:46.913
All of them were aggressive, and were taking,

00:11:47.205 --> 00:11:51.205
the land and property of other countries.

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:54.080
Extremely aggressive,

00:11:54.289 --> 00:11:58.371
they believed in the, killing of the people.

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:04.788
Extremely, insulting hot tempered people.

00:12:05.955 --> 00:12:08.663
So how to bring them to the normal?

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:14.289
To the Central Path?

00:12:18.122 --> 00:12:22.955
One side wa[,]s, as i told you Bhuh Bhur,

00:12:24.413 --> 00:12:28.080
Swaha Swadha, is consumption.

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:30.913
This was done by Guru Principle.

00:12:32.955 --> 00:12:37.330
Then we have, Mana, Jena [?sp] .

00:12:37.913 --> 00:12:39.455
That is collective.

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:41.955
They became collective  no doubt, because-

00:12:42.205 --> 00:12:43.663
they are so powerful,

00:12:43.997 --> 00:12:47.538
that they had such a lot of people - with them.

00:12:48.455 --> 00:12:53.205
To fight for the, oppressive,

00:12:54.039 --> 00:12:56.455
with their oppressive temperament they were,

00:12:56.747 --> 00:12:59.621
fighting on people and were, oppressing them.

00:13:01.205 --> 00:13:05.580
All this kind of knara-generation came,

00:13:05.955 --> 00:13:09.080
in the history as you know, and then it disappeared.

00:13:11.705 --> 00:13:13.705
Wars were created..

00:13:16.455 --> 00:13:19.122
Then so many people were killed..

00:13:20.747 --> 00:13:25.705
We had hitler as the maximum, of cruelty.

00:13:27.289 --> 00:13:30.747
They never cared for humanity.

00:13:32.289 --> 00:13:35.580
Then ultimately it came, to the Agnya.

00:13:36.538 --> 00:13:41.580
Agnya also they killed, Jesus Christ.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.788
They destroyed Jesus Christ.

00:13:47.496 --> 00:13:50.164
They destroyed so many great saints

00:13:50.371 --> 00:13:53.830
who were really saints, through the Central Path.

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:59.663
Some were Incarnations, and they destroyed them.

00:14:01.247 --> 00:14:05.538
All this happened, since the time of Rama.

00:14:07.247 --> 00:14:09.663
All that has happened.

00:14:11.413 --> 00:14:15.830
And one after another, so many rakshasas came,

00:14:16.747 --> 00:14:20.538
and they destroyed the peaceful culture of the world.

00:14:23.913 --> 00:14:26.496
Extremely arrogant,

00:14:26.913 --> 00:14:32.747
show offs as we can call them, very aggressive people.

00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:36.788
And this aggression came,

00:14:39.164 --> 00:14:42.538
came with such a great force,

00:14:43.705 --> 00:14:46.580
and followed one after another.

00:14:49.371 --> 00:14:51.872
It went up to a point.

00:14:52.788 --> 00:14:55.413
When people reacted,

00:14:55.872 --> 00:15:00.164
they were killed, and were destroyed.

00:15:06.164 --> 00:15:09.455
So horrible people were created.

00:15:17.289 --> 00:15:23.496
All these people, as they, were,,

00:15:28.496 --> 00:15:32.413
aggressive and destructive.

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:38.705
This nature is still within us,

00:15:39.205 --> 00:15:40.830
some people,

00:15:41.205 --> 00:15:43.705
because they are right sided.

00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:48.039
All right side people had this problem.

00:15:49.455 --> 00:15:55.080
Temper, aggression, controlling others,

00:15:56.955 --> 00:15:58.747
the growth stopped.

00:16:00.039 --> 00:16:02.788
And there was no spiritual growth.

00:16:03.955 --> 00:16:06.955
They wanted to have, spirituality,

00:16:07.538 --> 00:16:11.496
but with this kind of,

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:15.455
behaviour they had developed,

00:16:15.747 --> 00:16:17.955
spirituality ran away.

00:16:19.455 --> 00:16:22.164
We had so many Incarnations.

00:16:22.913 --> 00:16:25.580
They all were killed, crucified,

00:16:25.747 --> 00:16:27.580
or were finished.

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:34.455
There was no, possibility of saving,

00:16:36.122 --> 00:16:38.788
human beings in general.

00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:44.330
One bad man came and he ruined the whole world.

00:16:44.955 --> 00:16:46.663
We had one Hitler,

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.164
who really hit all the people,

00:16:49.164 --> 00:16:51.413
all the countries all the nations,

00:16:51.872 --> 00:16:54.538
and we were all finished.

00:16:55.496 --> 00:16:57.621
All this is because,

00:16:57.872 --> 00:17:02.872
we have taken to, right sided movement,

00:17:03.455 --> 00:17:07.705
which they thought was easier for spirituality which was not.

00:17:08.705 --> 00:17:11.164
So they crossed all the limits,

00:17:11.663 --> 00:17:13.872
and they reached a stage,

00:17:14.955 --> 00:17:17.247
that they became,

00:17:19.538 --> 00:17:21.788
absolutely devils rakshasas.

00:17:22.205 --> 00:17:27.205
Without realising, that human beings are rakshasas.

00:17:27.872 --> 00:17:29.997
That's what they become.

00:17:34.039 --> 00:17:36.955
Even their gurus were like that,

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:45.455
and nothing, but they taur-t-tortured, even the Incarnations.

00:17:45.955 --> 00:17:49.080
All the Incarnations were tortured by them.

00:17:49.872 --> 00:17:54.580
It was really, how they saved themselves- remarkable.

00:17:54.997 --> 00:18:00.705
But ultimately, they couldn't produce any results.

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:04.621
So the first thing I tried was to,

00:18:05.164 --> 00:18:08.705
study about, the Kundalini.

00:18:10.455 --> 00:18:13.830
That I should be able, to raise the Kundalini,

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:16.289
and I knew I had come for that.

00:18:16.747 --> 00:18:18.289
Not for anything else,

00:18:18.621 --> 00:18:21.496
but only to raise the Kundalini of people,

00:18:21.788 --> 00:18:25.705
so that they take, to the Central Path.

00:18:26.122 --> 00:18:28.872
Not to the right, or to the left.

00:18:29.621 --> 00:18:32.747
But I told you the knowledge of the left side,

00:18:32.955 --> 00:18:35.747
plus, raising your Kundalini.

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:41.830
By raising your Kundalini, you broke your Sahastrara.

00:18:42.913 --> 00:18:45.830
And you entered into the realm,

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:51.747
of real, Joy

00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:55.205
- of Reality.

00:18:56.205 --> 00:19:01.496
All these bad qualities, started falling out.

00:19:03.289 --> 00:19:06.580
In the Central Path first the Mooladhara came.

00:19:07.663 --> 00:19:11.371
By the awakening of the Mooladhara and the Central Path,

00:19:12.455 --> 00:19:17.122
you became, very pure people.

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:20.039
Your eyes became Pure,

00:19:20.247 --> 00:19:22.747
your licentiousness went away.

00:19:23.205 --> 00:19:25.413
Your cheapness went away.

00:19:25.621 --> 00:19:28.872
And you became very very,,

00:19:32.663 --> 00:19:35.747
I think we should call them the Holy people.

00:19:36.621 --> 00:19:38.705
Unless and until that happens,

00:19:39.247 --> 00:19:41.538
you cannot be in Sahaja Yoga.

00:19:41.788 --> 00:19:44.580
You cannot be a licentious,

00:19:44.872 --> 00:19:46.830
you cannot be a flirtish,

00:19:47.039 --> 00:19:48.955
you cannot be a man

00:19:49.164 --> 00:19:52.788
who wants to, grab money from others and all that,

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:57.955
or anyone who is very aggressive could be in Sahaja Yoga.

00:19:58.455 --> 00:20:00.705
So all such people were thrown out.

00:20:00.955 --> 00:20:03.413
Once they were thrown out they were showing their,

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:04.413
teeth I should say.

00:20:04.747 --> 00:20:07.289
They didn't like it that they were thrown out.

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:10.830
But, they understand, now some of them,

00:20:10.997 --> 00:20:13.122
that we have made mistakes.

00:20:13.621 --> 00:20:15.621
So first thing is,

00:20:15.913 --> 00:20:20.663
that you must develop your, sense of Chastity.

00:20:21.788 --> 00:20:24.872
Respect it. And enjoy it.

00:20:25.872 --> 00:20:30.788
That happened because of your Mooladhara being awakened.

00:20:31.788 --> 00:20:34.621
That's the first Chakra on the left side.

00:20:37.039 --> 00:20:39.580
Where you have Shri Ganesha.

00:20:40.872 --> 00:20:44.330
But on the right side also we have Deities.

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:50.247
On every Chakra, we have Deities, to compensate.

00:20:51.205 --> 00:20:54.289
For Shri Ganesha is in the Center.

00:20:55.872 --> 00:21:02.371
And that's how we were blessed, by His powerful, purity.

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:07.247
And we started understanding the beauty of purity,

00:21:07.747 --> 00:21:09.997
the power of purity.

00:21:13.872 --> 00:21:18.580
That's how our right side . . , we finished off.

00:21:19.289 --> 00:21:22.289
Right side was for fighting, for killing,

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:26.080
anger.

00:21:27.997 --> 00:21:30.747
There was no peace for these people,

00:21:31.455 --> 00:21:34.955
the only thing they knew how to dominate others,

00:21:35.164 --> 00:21:37.621
and to be intolerable.

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:43.330
So then they rose, to a higher,

00:21:43.705 --> 00:21:48.247
higher level of, Swadisthan.

00:21:49.455 --> 00:21:55.830
In Swadisthana, they rose and the aggressiveness,

00:21:56.413 --> 00:22:00.247
of the creative people, to create something.

00:22:01.621 --> 00:22:03.455
Even now we have many.

00:22:03.788 --> 00:22:06.205
They create all kinds of nonsense,

00:22:06.538 --> 00:22:09.039
create all site of gross text ,

00:22:09.289 --> 00:22:15.872
also very very, I should say, dirty things,

00:22:16.872 --> 00:22:18.997
to make a name.

00:22:19.663 --> 00:22:23.122
So this is the another thing we got it in Swadisthana,

00:22:23.371 --> 00:22:27.955
people who wanted to have, a name a position,

00:22:29.496 --> 00:22:32.413
that came from right Swadisthana.

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:36.580
Then the third Chakra that was there,

00:22:37.913 --> 00:22:39.997
was the Nabhi Chakra.

00:22:40.621 --> 00:22:42.330
On the Nabhi Chakra,

00:22:42.663 --> 00:22:45.289
they went all out to make money,

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:47.371
not Laxmi, but money.

00:22:48.205 --> 00:22:50.788
Money by any means.

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:55.289
And they cheated the whole world.

00:22:55.872 --> 00:22:58.371
With this money that they got,

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:03.289
they did all kinds of bad things.

00:23:05.747 --> 00:23:10.247
Either they cheated or they were aggressive.

00:23:12.955 --> 00:23:19.164
Cheating was very much in the left side countries like India,

00:23:20.705 --> 00:23:25.080
and aggressiveness in the right side countries.

00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:31.164
In the center, what quality we have,

00:23:31.621 --> 00:23:34.580
at the Swadisthana is the creativeness.

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.080
Creative of art,

00:23:37.289 --> 00:23:40.621
which is very beautiful, which is very deep,

00:23:40.997 --> 00:23:43.955
which is absolutely spiritual.

00:23:44.621 --> 00:23:46.580
That vanished.

00:23:47.039 --> 00:23:50.580
And people started showing even the Incarnations

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:53.205
full of dirty habits.

00:23:53.788 --> 00:23:58.205
All kinds of filth came in with that progress.

00:24:00.039 --> 00:24:03.247
Then as you- I told you there's Nabhi.

00:24:03.621 --> 00:24:09.039
In Nabhi people,, got after money.

00:24:12.997 --> 00:24:15.247
Left sided people were making money,

00:24:15.455 --> 00:24:18.205
right sided, were aggressive with their money.

00:24:18.413 --> 00:24:21.830
If they were earning, they thought they were on top of the world.

00:24:22.205 --> 00:24:23.663
If they had money,

00:24:23.913 --> 00:24:26.830
they thought nobody's better then us.

00:24:27.872 --> 00:24:30.496
All this, finished them off.

00:24:31.788 --> 00:24:33.164
It's finishing.

00:24:33.413 --> 00:24:36.955
It will come to that point where they will realise,

00:24:37.247 --> 00:24:40.830
that money is, not for destroying,

00:24:40.997 --> 00:24:42.205
but for construction.

00:24:43.122 --> 00:24:44.788
Constructing of the country

00:24:44.955 --> 00:24:47.455
- constructing of the human beings together,

00:24:47.705 --> 00:24:50.080
to bring peace and love among them.

00:24:51.413 --> 00:24:53.247
For helping,

00:24:54.747 --> 00:24:57.247
for doing all kinds of good things.

00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:02.455
Then the same right sided people,

00:25:02.747 --> 00:25:04.496
were,,

00:25:07.872 --> 00:25:10.496
to the Chakra of the Mother.

00:25:12.872 --> 00:25:14.955
Hah...and they were horrible mothers.

00:25:15.413 --> 00:25:17.580
Tried to dominate their children,

00:25:17.788 --> 00:25:19.413
dominate everyone,

00:25:19.621 --> 00:25:24.330
and, could not sacrifice anything for their children.

00:25:25.413 --> 00:25:28.289
We have had enough of these women,

00:25:28.955 --> 00:25:31.455
who are aggressive with their husbands,

00:25:31.663 --> 00:25:33.872
are aggressive with their children.

00:25:34.205 --> 00:25:38.830
And even the motherhood among men is dead and finished.

00:25:40.247 --> 00:25:42.830
All that kind of lot,

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:45.371
when I came on this Earth I saw,

00:25:45.663 --> 00:25:47.080
and I was shocked.

00:25:47.247 --> 00:25:49.747
What sort of human beings are those?

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:52.371
What am I going to do with them?

00:25:52.788 --> 00:25:55.830
How will I awaken their Kundalini?

00:25:56.289 --> 00:25:59.496
At the Nabhi Chakra only they were lost.

00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:03.247
But now it is the Mother's Chakra.

00:26:03.663 --> 00:26:06.538
They had no fatherhood, no motherhood,

00:26:06.747 --> 00:26:08.913
they drove out their children,

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:14.955
very selfish, self centered, dominating parents.

00:26:21.289 --> 00:26:24.247
This was . . the Heart Chakra.

00:26:25.413 --> 00:26:27.538
Then came the collective Chakra,

00:26:27.788 --> 00:26:29.788
what we call as the Vishuddi.

00:26:30.496 --> 00:26:32.205
At the Vishuddi Chakra,

00:26:32.413 --> 00:26:35.580
they wanted to occupy the whole world.

00:26:36.538 --> 00:26:40.413
They wanted to, occupy,

00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:43.997
the whole world as their own,

00:26:44.205 --> 00:26:45.580
to become emperors,

00:26:45.997 --> 00:26:48.080
and they formed empires,

00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:51.080
and misbehaved to such an extent,

00:26:51.289 --> 00:26:54.330
that it's not humanly possible to behave like that.

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:56.788
They really were rakshasas I should say,

00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:59.913
and those rakshas qualities are still there.

00:27:00.247 --> 00:27:02.580
In their behaviour, in everything,

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:04.621
you can see how they behave,

00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:08.496
towards people, treating them, like that.

00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:16.580
Creating, people who are, against spirituality,

00:27:17.289 --> 00:27:19.955
and those who are aggressive.

00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:25.955
Well these became like a, to-two sided,

00:27:26.205 --> 00:27:31.080
world where there are people who are, aggressive,

00:27:31.289 --> 00:27:33.496
and the people who are tortured.

00:27:33.955 --> 00:27:39.164
This two sided world, existed,

00:27:39.747 --> 00:27:43.289
even now, but is much less.

00:27:44.913 --> 00:27:48.496
Thanks to the collective understanding,

00:27:48.747 --> 00:27:53.872
there are many good institution that were established,

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:55.872
but they are not working out.

00:27:56.663 --> 00:27:58.538
They are not so successful.

00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:02.663
Because the men at the head of it, are controlling,

00:28:02.872 --> 00:28:04.663
but controlling what?

00:28:04.997 --> 00:28:06.164
Not themselves.

00:28:06.413 --> 00:28:08.080
Controlling others.

00:28:08.289 --> 00:28:10.872
And all their behaviour has spoilt,

00:28:11.164 --> 00:28:13.663
all the work of this Chakra.

00:28:15.205 --> 00:28:19.289
Collectively, you have, if you see around now today,

00:28:19.538 --> 00:28:23.747
everywhere theresss, war going on,

00:28:23.955 --> 00:28:26.496
fights going on, killing going on,

00:28:26.663 --> 00:28:28.164
destruction going on.

00:28:30.747 --> 00:28:32.330
How is it?

00:28:32.705 --> 00:28:33.913
There are so many,

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:37.247
spiritual people in now on this world.

00:28:37.872 --> 00:28:39.455
So the reason is,

00:28:39.663 --> 00:28:42.455
the spiritual people have become very quiet.

00:28:42.747 --> 00:28:45.997
Very much enjoying their, spiritual life.

00:28:46.371 --> 00:28:51.997
Have become very quiet and very, ... , peaceful people.

00:28:52.955 --> 00:28:55.080
But that doesn't bring peace!

00:28:56.663 --> 00:28:58.371
You have to be dynamic!

00:28:59.289 --> 00:29:01.413
And you have to bring peace in the world,

00:29:01.621 --> 00:29:03.413
you have to do something about it.

00:29:03.955 --> 00:29:06.580
We are very much satisfied with our progress,

00:29:06.913 --> 00:29:09.371
but we are not bothered as to see,

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:11.955
what it the progress others have done.

00:29:12.496 --> 00:29:13.955
How far they have gone.

00:29:14.164 --> 00:29:15.663
Where can we meet them.

00:29:15.913 --> 00:29:17.663
What can we change them.

00:29:17.872 --> 00:29:20.164
At my level I can change many things,

00:29:20.413 --> 00:29:23.496
but at your level how many people have you changed?

00:29:24.122 --> 00:29:25.496
What have you done?

00:29:25.788 --> 00:29:27.247
That has to be seen.

00:29:27.455 --> 00:29:31.455
Still you live with your ego, on the Agnya.

00:29:33.039 --> 00:29:35.538
And, you are very happy with your peace,

00:29:35.747 --> 00:29:38.663
with everything you have got through Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:38.913 --> 00:29:42.830
This is the biggest calamity that the world is facing today.

00:29:43.039 --> 00:29:45.538
That those who are also spiritual,

00:29:45.747 --> 00:29:47.997
those who have achieved great heights,

00:29:48.164 --> 00:29:49.663
are least bothered!

00:29:49.872 --> 00:29:51.955
As to what good has to be done.

00:29:52.122 --> 00:29:56.164
What the are doing is to enjoy their own - spirituality,

00:29:56.788 --> 00:30:00.247
come to the Puja have more, and more, of it.

00:30:00.496 --> 00:30:06.788
But, they have done, no collective work to change people.

00:30:06.997 --> 00:30:09.705
Some of them are working one or two, bas [hindi: stop],

00:30:09.955 --> 00:30:12.580
the rest of them are having a good time,

00:30:12.788 --> 00:30:16.205
enjoying themselves, in such a manner,

00:30:16.747 --> 00:30:19.997
that people accept them at great souls

00:30:20.164 --> 00:30:23.164
good people, that's all.

00:30:23.496 --> 00:30:25.997
I would like you to now introspect,

00:30:26.205 --> 00:30:27.247
and find out,

00:30:27.455 --> 00:30:29.580
how much collective work you have done,

00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:33.997
how many people you have got, like that.

00:30:34.247 --> 00:30:36.496
With whom are you, talking?

00:30:36.913 --> 00:30:39.747
How many people have you told about Sahaja Yoga?

00:30:40.289 --> 00:30:42.496
Only so many are there.

00:30:42.747 --> 00:30:45.289
Christ had only 12 disciples,

00:30:45.538 --> 00:30:47.955
they are much more dynamic then you are!

00:30:48.205 --> 00:30:50.955
So now you should take to the right side.

00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:53.371
And when you take to the right side,

00:30:53.371 --> 00:30:55.371
we'll create dynamic people.

00:30:55.997 --> 00:30:58.788
Not just, some useless,

00:31:00.496 --> 00:31:04.830
patient, very quiet, peaceful people.

00:31:05.289 --> 00:31:07.413
This was not the aim of Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:07.663 --> 00:31:10.955
The aim of Sahaja Yoga is to change.

00:31:11.205 --> 00:31:12.955
Change so many.

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:17.039
And those who are doing that, all my blessings are with them.

00:31:17.371 --> 00:31:19.830
But those who are just keeping to themselves,

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:22.247
it is not a very good thing.

00:31:22.455 --> 00:31:23.538
In your country

00:31:23.747 --> 00:31:26.330
how many people have got to Sahaja Yoga?

00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:27.455
Just find out.

00:31:27.705 --> 00:31:30.247
With how many people you have worked it out?

00:31:30.705 --> 00:31:32.872
So yours is not a complete Yoga.

00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:36.455
Yours is a partial Yoga, of the left side where,

00:31:36.663 --> 00:31:39.289
you are very loving very kind very this thing.

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:42.330
I'm not saying that you should become aggressive in any way.

00:31:42.621 --> 00:31:45.621
But even, I have seen people want to be leaders,

00:31:46.247 --> 00:31:48.122
they want to be something great,

00:31:48.371 --> 00:31:51.413
but how many people have they given realisation?

00:31:51.621 --> 00:31:55.164
How many people have they talked about Sahaja Yoga?

00:31:55.371 --> 00:31:58.621
I have seven [see even] in the Aeroplane also you go,

00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:02.496
you walk in the street anywhere people talk about Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:04.289
But here we are,

00:32:04.496 --> 00:32:07.289
using Sahaja Yoga for our greatness,

00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:12.205
for our, understanding of ourselves.

00:32:12.413 --> 00:32:15.913
This is not why Sahaja Yoga has been brought to you.

00:32:16.289 --> 00:32:18.371
It has been brought to you

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:22.830
for giving realisations to many people.

00:32:23.621 --> 00:32:26.747
I request all the younger people, younger generation,

00:32:26.913 --> 00:32:29.247
not to waste their Sahaj energies,

00:32:29.413 --> 00:32:32.039
on nonsense as the old people have done.

00:32:32.413 --> 00:32:35.663
You better go ahead and talk to people about Sahaja Yoga,

00:32:35.872 --> 00:32:37.663
and spread the Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:41.080
They are more interested in running schools,

00:32:41.289 --> 00:32:44.455
in looking after the destitute, doing this doing that

00:32:44.663 --> 00:32:45.997
that's not your job.

00:32:46.247 --> 00:32:49.455
Your job is to create more Sahaja Yogis.

00:32:49.663 --> 00:32:51.080
More Sahaja Yoginis.

00:32:51.330 --> 00:32:52.413
But that is not there,

00:32:52.621 --> 00:32:55.830
what I find is it's not there.

00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:57.830
The right side is missing.

00:32:58.164 --> 00:33:00.039
You should come to the right side.

00:33:00.247 --> 00:33:01.538
Go all ahead.

00:33:01.747 --> 00:33:03.830
Nothing will happen to you.

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:06.164
Nobody can kill you,

00:33:06.705 --> 00:33:08.289
nobody can disturb you,

00:33:08.496 --> 00:33:10.621
nobody can arrest you, take it from me.

00:33:10.872 --> 00:33:12.289
You have powers,

00:33:12.455 --> 00:33:15.247
but if you don't use them, you are like this.

00:33:17.205 --> 00:33:20.913
That is why we have come to the stagnated point.

00:33:21.371 --> 00:33:24.663
That we should know we have to use our right side.

00:33:24.872 --> 00:33:27.788
Right side is very important.

00:33:28.496 --> 00:33:31.122
Next time I'll tell you about right side,

00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:32.788
what right sided things you have,

00:33:33.039 --> 00:33:34.663
now you cannot become left sided

00:33:34.872 --> 00:33:35.913
whatever you may try.

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:40.663
So you use your right side in the right direction,

00:33:41.164 --> 00:33:43.164
with the right understanding.

00:33:43.455 --> 00:33:46.747
Not as, some sort,

00:33:47.413 --> 00:33:49.371
I should say, very,

00:33:49.788 --> 00:33:55.080
arbitrary, or very dominating, like Hitlers.

00:33:55.538 --> 00:33:58.663
We have had also Hitlers among Sahaja Yogis.

00:33:58.913 --> 00:34:01.705
But now, the time has come for you,

00:34:02.122 --> 00:34:06.289
to do something more then what the saints have done before.

00:34:06.538 --> 00:34:08.122
To work it out that way.

00:34:08.330 --> 00:34:09.913
Not to keep to yourself,

00:34:10.122 --> 00:34:12.205
that, you have a family,

00:34:12.413 --> 00:34:14.205
you have very nice children,

00:34:14.413 --> 00:34:15.621
having, enjoying, all that

00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:17.621
- that's not the Sahaja Yoga for.

00:34:19.205 --> 00:34:23.747
Sahaja Yoga is for transforming the whole world.

00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:27.122
You have to think about it.

00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:30.039
What are you doing, where are you?

00:34:30.621 --> 00:34:33.705
And what have you achieved out of Sahaja Yoga?

00:34:35.122 --> 00:34:38.872
Then we come to the, Agnya.

00:34:40.039 --> 00:34:43.413
In Agnya, what has happened is Sahaja Yogis

00:34:43.621 --> 00:34:45.580
are become, they have,

00:34:45.747 --> 00:34:49.080
they can bear anything, they can suffer anything,

00:34:49.413 --> 00:34:51.830
that's not we want.

00:34:52.289 --> 00:34:56.164
What we want to remove the sufferings of others,

00:34:56.621 --> 00:34:58.788
remove the aggression of others.

00:34:59.122 --> 00:35:03.538
So we don't, that kind of organisation we don't have.

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:06.788
That kind of understanding we dont have.

00:35:07.330 --> 00:35:11.705
And if that works out, you will be different people.

00:35:12.247 --> 00:35:14.371
So we have become like,

00:35:15.455 --> 00:35:18.788
saints you see sitting in their herm-hermit

00:35:19.122 --> 00:35:20.705
halls something like that.

00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:28.538
Not more then that.
So better try, to do something, positive,

00:35:28.788 --> 00:35:30.247
without aggression.

00:35:30.289 --> 00:35:32.705
I know some of you are still very aggressive.

00:35:33.747 --> 00:35:36.122
Are show offs I know that.

00:35:37.747 --> 00:35:44.663
But if you get into the mood of working out collectively,

00:35:45.830 --> 00:35:49.538
then you will realise what, mistakes you have.

00:35:51.289 --> 00:35:54.247
Still what is lacking in your personality.

00:35:54.621 --> 00:35:56.747
That is very important.

00:35:57.205 --> 00:36:01.205
At Agnya Chakra many Sahaja Yogis falter.

00:36:02.538 --> 00:36:04.580
I don't know what happens to them.

00:36:05.705 --> 00:36:08.913
At Agnya, I have told that you must forgive.

00:36:09.413 --> 00:36:10.872
But that doesn't mean

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:13.747
that you allow people to do wrong things.

00:36:14.705 --> 00:36:17.122
Because you want to forgive it's very easy,

00:36:17.289 --> 00:36:19.164
not to fight not to say anything,

00:36:19.371 --> 00:36:21.830
just keep out just forgive, no!

00:36:22.788 --> 00:36:25.080
You go and talk to that person

00:36:27.913 --> 00:36:30.122
and tell him it is wrong.

00:36:32.538 --> 00:36:34.705
You have to face it.

00:36:35.371 --> 00:36:38.289
If you cannot face it then you are useless.

00:36:38.997 --> 00:36:41.080
Just like any other people.

00:36:41.289 --> 00:36:44.538
What's the use of you people getting your realisation?

00:36:46.538 --> 00:36:49.788
So now, we have to understand,

00:36:49.997 --> 00:36:52.788
that's it's not only that we have vibrations,

00:36:53.039 --> 00:36:54.496
that we are alright,

00:36:54.705 --> 00:36:58.997
that you can cure some people,is the last word -no.

00:36:59.621 --> 00:37:00.955
You have to spread it.

00:37:01.205 --> 00:37:04.538
You have to go in the public. You have to be collective,

00:37:04.913 --> 00:37:07.205
on this point and you have to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:07.413 --> 00:37:09.747
With so many Sahaja Yogis all over the world

00:37:09.872 --> 00:37:11.788
we have not progressed much.

00:37:14.371 --> 00:37:17.289
So now - it is - you have to plan.

00:37:17.538 --> 00:37:19.039
What you want to do,

00:37:19.289 --> 00:37:20.747
how you want to do it,

00:37:20.747 --> 00:37:22.955
and how you want to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:23.164 --> 00:37:24.872
It's very important.

00:37:27.289 --> 00:37:32.289
Because, you people are, good at,

00:37:32.538 --> 00:37:35.913
say, talking about Sahaja Yoga, singing about Sahaja Yoga,

00:37:36.164 --> 00:37:38.080
all these things are useless

00:37:38.247 --> 00:37:41.080
unless and until you have concrete proof,

00:37:41.413 --> 00:37:44.413
of getting many more people in Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:48.080
In a small country like Turkey,

00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:51.955
we have 25,000 Sahaja Yogis what do you say?

00:37:52.413 --> 00:37:54.371
They are all Muslims.

00:37:54.705 --> 00:37:57.289
Twenty five thousands Muslims,

00:37:58.496 --> 00:38:00.621
becoming Sahaja Yogis.

00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:05.496
Why, you find that number is very small in any other country?

00:38:07.538 --> 00:38:12.788
They are not very rich, but they care for their self realisation,

00:38:12.955 --> 00:38:15.955
and for too are giving self realisations to others.

00:38:16.330 --> 00:38:19.830
It's very surprising, how it has worked out,

00:38:19.997 --> 00:38:21.830
how it has spread.

00:38:22.621 --> 00:38:26.164
So instead of thinking of your problems,

00:38:26.538 --> 00:38:28.997
of your enemies,

00:38:29.371 --> 00:38:33.330
of your powers, think of giving power to others.

00:38:33.872 --> 00:38:37.455
And making them Sahaja Yoga. It's very important.

00:38:38.413 --> 00:38:42.039
If you are in Sahastrara, then you have all the powers.

00:38:43.830 --> 00:38:46.621
In Sahastrara if you do not spread Sahaja Yoga,

00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:49.039
what's the use of getting realisation?

00:38:49.289 --> 00:38:52.663
Just for yourself? It's being very selfish.

00:38:53.039 --> 00:38:58.080
So I would say that, instead of spreading your own glory,

00:38:58.371 --> 00:39:01.997
your own grim, your own, ... name

00:39:02.247 --> 00:39:06.455
please, try to get more people to Sahaja Yoga.

00:39:06.830 --> 00:39:09.788
Go into a very dynamic force.

00:39:10.705 --> 00:39:12.788
So many people have complained to me

00:39:13.122 --> 00:39:16.122
that Sahaja Yogis are nothing but dead people.

00:39:17.955 --> 00:39:20.205
Is that what you are?

00:39:21.913 --> 00:39:25.872
Only single person like me has done so much work.

00:39:26.247 --> 00:39:27.955
So why not you people?

00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:31.496
In your country have you worked it out, all over?

00:39:31.705 --> 00:39:33.997
Just think about it.

00:39:34.289 --> 00:39:37.164
And that's why, unless and until

00:39:37.371 --> 00:39:39.913
you don't do it you are not sampoorna, you are not complete,

00:39:39.955 --> 00:39:42.621
and the Adi Shakti's powers you have not understood,

00:39:43.247 --> 00:39:45.164
in it's full form.

00:39:45.788 --> 00:39:47.788
That's why I'm telling you today,

00:39:47.997 --> 00:39:49.788
it's a very important day that

00:39:49.997 --> 00:39:51.788
you worship me as Adi Shakti.

00:39:51.997 --> 00:39:52.872
But you should know that

00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:55.496
Adi Shakti has to be a complete form.

00:39:55.830 --> 00:39:58.496
It cannot be only half left sided - no.

00:40:00.455 --> 00:40:03.788
If that doesn't work out, then what's the use?

00:40:04.039 --> 00:40:08.205
It's like any other getting any other, realisation.

00:40:08.621 --> 00:40:10.872
That's not so important.

00:40:11.663 --> 00:40:13.496
Not only that you should spread,

00:40:13.705 --> 00:40:15.580
but also you should make them,

00:40:15.788 --> 00:40:17.580
and realise it.

00:40:25.621 --> 00:40:27.872
All my Blessings, all my Love,

00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:30.496
all my Powers I give you.

00:40:31.663 --> 00:40:34.122
But try to understand.

00:40:35.164 --> 00:40:36.455
Alright?

00:40:36.705 --> 00:40:38.663
Thank you very much.
