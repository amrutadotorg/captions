WEBVTT

00:03.277 --> 00:11.558
Today we are here to celebrate Krishna
Puja.

00:13.237 --> 00:21.999
I went to America and they wanted me
to have a Mahakali Puja.

00:22.200 --> 00:26.480
But I said, no, let me talk about Krishna
only,

00:26.681 --> 00:37.728
because we have to first realize what is
the strength of this Puja.

00:38.241 --> 00:44.413
How are we going to establish Shri Krishna
within ourselves?

00:44.614 --> 00:51.466
He, Himself has said, that whenever there
is a downfall of dharma -

00:51.667 --> 00:57.489
dharma doesn’t mean what we understand
as Hinduism, Christianity

00:57.690 --> 01:01.414
or Islamic nonsense - it is not.

01:01.615 --> 01:14.250
Dharma means, our primordial taboos that
are built-in in the human beings.

01:15.215 --> 01:19.646
About these, I think aboriginals knew
better than we.

01:19.847 --> 01:23.711
But then what we did, we dominated them

01:23.912 --> 01:29.465
and also they had to change their style
of life.

01:29.666 --> 01:33.378
The primordial taboos are only understood

01:33.579 --> 01:40.646
if people are trying to understand oneself

01:40.847 --> 01:47.250
or else, whatever has come to them through
tradition.

01:47.504 --> 01:51.491
Now, Sahaj Dharma is a little bit
different,

01:51.692 --> 02:02.049
in the sense that it’s much higher than
the Sahaj ideas that we talk of,

02:02.250 --> 02:09.756
but it’s much higher than even what Shri
Krishna said or Shri Rama said.

02:09.957 --> 02:15.509
First Shri Rama thought, best is to give
them disciplines.

02:15.710 --> 02:22.197
People should be serious about life,
have full idea

02:22.398 --> 02:27.053
about their own being, they should
respect themselves.

02:27.254 --> 02:34.379
All these things were written down long
time back.

02:34.580 --> 02:38.525
Also, people, basically when they were
good people,

02:38.726 --> 02:43.636
they understood that whatever is bad
for us, we should not do.

02:44.120 --> 02:46.743
These are primordial taboos.

02:46.944 --> 02:51.785
Now, these primordial taboos are built-in
within us.

02:51.986 --> 03:00.295
Now, supposing I say don’t drink, you will
go on drinking.

03:00.557 --> 03:04.687
If I say don’t tell lies, you will tell
lies.

03:04.888 --> 03:10.085
It’s the human nature, you see, is to go
against primordial taboo

03:10.286 --> 03:12.992
because they think now, they have freedom,

03:13.193 --> 03:15.985
freedom to do what they like.

03:16.186 --> 03:20.450
You are free people. Actually they are not.

03:20.651 --> 03:28.718
They are under the spell of all the kinds
of allurement, you can call it,

03:28.939 --> 03:35.660
or temptations, which are against human
life.

03:35.861 --> 03:43.012
And it’s very natural to be a person
of Dharma.

03:43.213 --> 03:47.822
Small children mostly have it. For example,
I’ve seen children,

03:48.023 --> 03:51.577
they feel very shy to take out their
clothes,

03:51.778 --> 03:53.923
even small, small boys, I’ve seen.

03:54.124 --> 04:01.506
They won’t take out their clothes in
the presence of others. They feel shy.

04:01.776 --> 04:03.894
So, all these are described like

04:04.094 --> 04:08.179
“Ya Devi Sarva Bhuteshu Lajja Rupena
Samsthita”.

04:08.380 --> 04:14.119
So, you should be shy, you should be humble

04:14.734 --> 04:18.473
and respect your body – it’s very
important.

04:18.674 --> 04:26.126
In these modern times, exposure of body is
regarded as a great achievement of women.

04:26.327 --> 04:28.493
They are trying to become aboriginals, you
see.

04:28.694 --> 04:33.404
That time they never had these ideas and
they were not so confused, you see.

04:33.605 --> 04:36.838
So, even if their women were scantily
dressed,

04:37.039 --> 04:40.974
it didn’t mean that it was some sort
of a sex

04:41.175 --> 04:47.017
or some sort of an attraction for men

04:47.218 --> 04:51.058
or men behaving in funny manners

04:51.259 --> 04:56.110
to show that they have a special attraction
for women.

04:56.311 --> 04:59.135
I mean, why should you?

05:00.639 --> 05:06.504
It is absolutely absurd that men should be
attracted to women

05:06.705 --> 05:09.521
and women should be attracted to men -

05:09.722 --> 05:14.890
and on the road, on the street, you go,
you see, just that going on!

05:15.091 --> 05:21.011
This adharma is the worst I think, it’s
a curse.

05:21.241 --> 05:23.047
Because after coming to Sahaja Yoga also

05:23.247 --> 05:25.383
people start doing this nonsense, you know.

05:25.584 --> 05:27.752
They should all go to lunatic asylum,
I think,

05:27.953 --> 05:30.629
they are no good for Sahaja Yoga.

05:30.830 --> 05:36.403
But dharma gets established as soon as you
have the light of the Spirit.

05:36.604 --> 05:46.058
At the time of Shri Rama, He had to put
down: A, B, C, D, E, F.

05:46.259 --> 05:54.032
At the time of Moses, also, He had to put
down ten commandments -

05:54.233 --> 05:59.408
but Krishna thought the other way round -

05:59.609 --> 06:06.567
to establish a Dharma of pure love, pure
love.

06:07.898 --> 06:14.929
So, because He wanted that Shri Rama’s
taboos were forced on people,

06:15.130 --> 06:20.331
just like Islamic, just like Christians -
never works.

06:20.532 --> 06:23.803
So, He thought better to ask them in their
freedom,

06:24.004 --> 06:27.347
they must develop pure love.

06:27.548 --> 06:34.655
Radha, who was with Him, as His power,
is called as Alladha dayini.

06:34.856 --> 06:40.505
She’s the one who gives joy. Pure joy!

06:42.224 --> 06:49.456
So, all these limited type of attractions
end up in trouble.

06:50.032 --> 06:53.183
Now, drinking is against you, you know
that.

06:53.384 --> 06:58.246
Today they are talking about tobacco,
tomorrow they’ll talk of drinking

06:58.447 --> 07:04.441
when they will find so many people
suffering from horrible livers and dying.

07:04.642 --> 07:06.778
Then they will taboo it.

07:06.979 --> 07:10.773
But it’s a natural taboo for your body.

07:10.974 --> 07:16.414
If you do something all the time which is
not good for you,

07:16.615 --> 07:22.319
for your good life, you are becoming
adharmic.

07:23.647 --> 07:26.599
This is to be understood very clearly

07:26.799 --> 07:37.865
that the Sahaja Dharma is that you are
just free -

07:38.065 --> 07:42.665
complete freedom from lust, greed and all
nonsense.

07:42.866 --> 07:46.992
You are above it. You are above this.

07:47.193 --> 07:50.567
Sahaj Dharma is above the Dharma

07:50.667 --> 07:55.662
established by Shri
Krishna or by Shri Rama.

07:55.879 --> 07:58.640
Because you have reached that stage.

07:58.841 --> 08:04.347
It’s in complete freedom you have to be
dharmic.

08:04.548 --> 08:08.023
Whatever is not good for you, you should
not do.

08:08.224 --> 08:15.564
I don’t have to tell you that you don’t do
this or you don’t do that.

08:15.781 --> 08:18.870
Whatever I say may not be acceptable

08:19.071 --> 08:22.066
but immediately your vibrations will tell
you.

08:22.267 --> 08:28.942
This is Sahaj Dharma. In the Sahaj Dharma
you get rid of all kinds of,

08:29.143 --> 08:31.613
as they say: (Hindi words) kaama, krodha,
mada, matsa, lobha, moha.

08:31.814 --> 08:54.149
Means – lust, anger, attractions, then –
greed;

08:54.350 --> 09:02.962
that’s very important, greed – greed and
attractions.

09:03.386 --> 09:11.907
Now, if you understand how people are
greedy; greedy for what?

09:12.108 --> 09:16.766
This America is dying of consumerism, you
see.

09:16.996 --> 09:19.816
Now, see the trick of the trade:

09:20.017 --> 09:26.568
In America, you can borrow any amount
of money from the bank, no problem.

09:26.769 --> 09:33.727
Now, even if you don’t borrow, they’ll send
you a letter,

09:33.928 --> 09:38.979
“Why don’t you take twenty thousand
checks we are sending you, why not have it?

09:39.193 --> 09:46.915
Ah, very rich you’ll become, you see – it’s
very nice to take the loan.”

09:47.116 --> 09:51.319
I was told some people used to come
to Ganapatipule after taking loans.

09:51.520 --> 09:54.767
I said, “Stop that nonsense.”

09:54.968 --> 10:00.057
So they take the loan and then they come
to Ganapatipule.

10:00.258 --> 10:06.688
All the time their mind is: “How will I pay
this loan, how will I manage?”

10:06.889 --> 10:09.537
All the time the attention is distracted,

10:09.738 --> 10:16.588
even when you want to do something good
to yourself by coming to Ganapatipule.

10:16.789 --> 10:20.917
So, such a mind is not free.

10:22.120 --> 10:31.192
The free mind is that which has attention
completely enlightened by the Spirit.

10:31.907 --> 10:39.154
But problem is we are still rising out
of this human bondage

10:39.355 --> 10:44.398
to a higher life of realization.

10:45.374 --> 10:51.621
And when we are going to that level, we
have to realize

10:51.822 --> 10:57.154
that we have to give up all these shackles,

10:57.355 --> 11:01.072
all these horrible things within us.

11:01.273 --> 11:07.196
Like a bird, when it is born out
of the egg,

11:07.397 --> 11:11.528
shakes out all the parts of the egg.

11:11.729 --> 11:15.492
Your brothers, your sisters, your father,
your mother, your husband;

11:15.693 --> 11:22.000
everybody – they’ll try to put you down.

11:22.201 --> 11:24.319
Now, if they are drinking, they’ll say,
“Come along,

11:24.520 --> 11:27.918
you better have something to drink, you
are not social,

11:28.119 --> 11:33.225
you are useless, you are not up to date.
What is this nonsense?”

11:33.426 --> 11:40.997
That’s how a fashion starts and this
collective action of fashion

11:41.198 --> 11:47.256
didn’t come from Shri Krishna and not
in Sahaj.

11:47.457 --> 11:55.393
In Sahaj, you are absolutely free from all
these nonsenses.

11:55.961 --> 11:58.399
If you want, you can wear a good dress,

11:58.600 --> 12:03.377
if you don’t want you need not. You are
free.

12:03.893 --> 12:07.768
You are free from money bondage. This is
very important.

12:07.969 --> 12:10.886
Money bondage is another thing. I know
some Sahaja Yogis

12:11.087 --> 12:14.603
who came to Sahaja Yoga trying to make
money out of Sahaja Yoga.

12:14.804 --> 12:17.492
You came to Sahaja Yoga for what?

12:17.693 --> 12:20.333
To get out of that money bondage.

12:20.534 --> 12:26.314
In the Sahaj Dharma, to you money is
nothing but the dust of your feet.

12:26.965 --> 12:28.848
Nothing so important.

12:29.049 --> 12:36.801
Then, we have such a collective sense
of accepting nonsense.

12:37.002 --> 12:41.837
That has to be dropped out, especially
in America, I was surprised.

12:42.038 --> 12:47.373
Also in England. A fellow came as a hippie.

12:54.128 --> 12:59.826
His hair was looking like some monkey,

13:00.027 --> 13:03.472
monkey’s better I must say, I don’t know
like what,

13:03.673 --> 13:08.668
all put together like a, you can say…

13:08.869 --> 13:12.358
I mean, there is nothing to compare, I tell
you.

13:12.559 --> 13:16.630
So I asked him, “Why are you having such
hair?”

13:16.831 --> 13:18.862
He said, “Because I want to be primitive.

13:19.063 --> 13:22.001
Now, we have to get to the primitiveness.”

13:22.202 --> 13:24.480
I said, “But your brain is modern,

13:24.681 --> 13:26.604
what is the use of growing your hair like
that?

13:26.805 --> 13:31.051
You think you can become primitive?
You cannot!”

13:33.379 --> 13:36.944
Then afterwards I learned that he died.

13:37.145 --> 13:42.362
Another one like that came and he didn’t
die,

13:42.562 --> 13:45.261
but went to lunatic asylum.

13:45.462 --> 13:49.301
Like that I met many, but why do you do it?

13:49.502 --> 13:52.365
Because that’s the fashion.

13:52.566 --> 14:00.733
Now Italy, you know, is prospering because
of all kinds of designers.

14:01.049 --> 14:09.073
Now there is a joke about the new rich
people, in Russia especially.

14:09.274 --> 14:12.306
Russians are not like that, normally.

14:12.507 --> 14:16.844
They don’t accept something because it is
a fashion.

14:17.045 --> 14:27.171
So, one fellow said that: “My God, you lost
your hand in that accident!”

14:27.372 --> 14:33.840
“Doesn’t matter, but I lost my very
expensive watch from Switzerland.”

14:34.041 --> 14:37.085
“Really? What?” “It was a Rolex.”

14:37.286 --> 14:39.488
Doesn’t matter if the hand is gone.

14:39.689 --> 14:43.448
The Rolex is gone! Rolex is the fashion.

14:43.649 --> 14:48.260
[Can you remove him down, this one,
because people can’t see you.]

14:48.798 --> 14:53.160
So these are new rich people who have
money.

14:53.361 --> 14:59.569
(Dog is on the stage: It’s alright now,
he’ll be able. Come along, come along. Ah.

14:59.944 --> 15:04.103
Sit down, sit down. Now go down)

15:11.282 --> 15:13.151
They (the dogs) don’t follow any fashions,

15:13.352 --> 15:17.408
I have not seen dogs taking to any
fashions.

15:17.609 --> 15:22.507
Monkeys is taking - I mean, supposing, you
see the Italian designers

15:22.707 --> 15:27.210
make something special for them, they
won’t think much of it.

15:27.411 --> 15:34.514
Maybe their masters might buy it, but not
these animals.

15:34.715 --> 15:37.262
Now, we don’t have to become animals
of course,

15:37.463 --> 15:42.220
but we don’t also have to become
slaves of fashions.

15:42.421 --> 15:44.975
So there are some shops which are very
expensive.

15:45.175 --> 15:48.411
Why? Because they are designers.

15:48.612 --> 15:52.260
So you move about telling everybody, “See,
I am wearing this thing

15:52.461 --> 15:56.115
from a designer shop, this is from designer
shop.”

15:56.316 --> 15:58.878
That means, what about you?

15:59.079 --> 16:04.950
You have no sense of designs, you have
no sense of understanding

16:05.151 --> 16:08.257
what you need and what you don’t need.

16:08.458 --> 16:12.062
And nowadays most of them are in jail also,
sorry to say,

16:12.263 --> 16:17.870
but they have money and they have made
money by befooling you.

16:18.071 --> 16:24.211
Specially in America I was surprised that
they were selling most of the things

16:24.412 --> 16:28.236
which were coming from Italy designs,
Italian designs,

16:28.437 --> 16:33.847
written down Italian design, so they were
buying it, Italian design.

16:34.586 --> 16:40.654
I was surprised that such artistic things
they create

16:40.855 --> 16:46.624
that are available everywhere, such
beautiful things.

16:46.825 --> 16:54.238
But what they believe in, is some sort
of a group madness.

16:54.439 --> 16:59.978
Everybody wearing the same kind of design
is from this or that.

17:00.233 --> 17:03.444
This is not Sahaj Dharma. We are not
slaves of anything.

17:03.645 --> 17:07.746
We are free people. We have not to accept
any design or anything.

17:07.947 --> 17:12.730
Ah, it is there, is there! Let the stupid
follow that.

17:12.931 --> 17:15.564
We are Sahaja Yogis.

17:15.765 --> 17:20.394
Now, this also prevails among people who
are supposed to be sadhus,

17:20.595 --> 17:24.023
they all dress up the same way.

17:24.224 --> 17:27.044
How can you make out who is who?

17:27.245 --> 17:30.683
In Sahaja Yoga, we don’t want you to dress
up the same way,

17:30.884 --> 17:34.869
look the same way, cut your hair the same
way. No.

17:35.070 --> 17:38.444
You have to be individuals, because you
are free,

17:38.645 --> 17:44.176
but that doesn’t mean - freedom is always
supported by wisdom -

17:44.391 --> 17:48.707
that doesn’t mean that you do what you
like.

17:48.908 --> 17:54.278
All kinds of funny things happen when
a person doesn’t know

17:54.479 --> 17:59.450
what is the light of the Spirit.
In the light of the Spirit,

17:59.651 --> 18:06.606
you don’t get involved into this kind
of collective madness that is going on.

18:06.807 --> 18:10.057
We are so collective in mad things.

18:10.258 --> 18:15.396
I wish they could be collective more
in wise things.

18:15.597 --> 18:21.830
Wisdom is very important and a joy-giving
quality of Radhaji,

18:22.031 --> 18:25.891
Ahlada Dayini Shakti, has to come within
us.

18:26.092 --> 18:31.163
Means, when we meet another person
in the collectivity,

18:31.370 --> 18:35.962
another person should feel happy meeting
you.

18:36.163 --> 18:40.948
So He taught the Dharma of love.

18:41.149 --> 18:47.249
Love is not there if you discard because
he is black or because he is brown,

18:47.450 --> 18:54.264
because he is white. It’s very
superficial -

18:54.465 --> 18:58.592
what is black, white and yellow? I don’t
understand.

18:58.793 --> 19:03.438
Here they go to the sea shores to make
themselves black

19:03.639 --> 19:11.970
and there they say, “We don’t want to have
any blacks,” specially for Americans.

19:12.171 --> 19:18.776
I think this kind of separation I found
there,

19:18.977 --> 19:23.786
among the blacks and the whites, I really
wept.

19:23.987 --> 19:27.431
I went to Harlem. Sahaja yogis said,
“Mother, will you go to Harlem?”

19:27.631 --> 19:31.595
I said, “Why not, I’m black. If you call
me black, I’m black.

19:31.796 --> 19:36.071
If you call me white, I’m white. If you
call me yellow, I’m yellow.

19:36.272 --> 19:39.461
So, I’m going.” And there I had a lecture,
you know,

19:39.662 --> 19:42.218
so many people were there, really I cannot
forget.

19:42.419 --> 19:50.341
It is one of the most famous place that
there is built in that hall

19:50.556 --> 19:59.220
and the same hall is built in Australia
where I had addressed many people.

19:59.421 --> 20:04.939
I thought, “Just look at this!” They said,
“Mother, the Australians copied from us.”

20:05.140 --> 20:08.668
Now, these people, so sweet, so beautiful,
I tell you.

20:08.869 --> 20:14.491
I could see their heart, I could feel it
and the fellow was trying to compere.

20:14.692 --> 20:17.614
After my lecture he just came, he hugged
me, kissed me.

20:17.815 --> 20:21.544
I mean, he would have even minced me,
a little boy

20:21.745 --> 20:27.001
about twenty-two years of age; such love
he felt.

20:27.202 --> 20:30.387
And he said, “Mother, next time You come,
You are going to come to Harlem.”

20:30.588 --> 20:33.293
But I am told that hall is closed.

20:33.494 --> 20:41.640
So the Americans system somehow or another
goes against democracy,

20:42.414 --> 20:49.607
not only against democracy but against
what Abraham Lincoln wanted.

20:49.808 --> 20:54.685
They had such a great man there

20:55.086 --> 20:58.752
and there is a little street I saw in his
name.

20:58.953 --> 21:07.480
Of course in Washington they say they have
some nice, beautiful statues.

21:07.687 --> 21:12.405
But otherwise his principles are finished,

21:12.606 --> 21:20.062
his ideals are finished because somehow
or other,

21:20.270 --> 21:22.694
some people came and wrote against -

21:22.895 --> 21:27.771
from England especially - against the black
people.

21:31.224 --> 21:36.137
What business they have to write against
something that is created by God?

21:36.338 --> 21:39.211
If there are the same colours everywhere,

21:39.412 --> 21:42.400
they all will look like military people.

21:42.601 --> 21:45.231
They have to have different colors,

21:45.432 --> 21:47.718
they have to have different hues.

21:47.918 --> 21:51.064
See, look at the trees, look at
the flowers.

21:51.265 --> 21:56.381
And look at the different hues the sky has,

21:56.582 --> 21:59.836
just to make us happy – Alladha.

22:00.037 --> 22:06.628
What gives you happiness is variety.
Variety is a sign of beauty.

22:06.829 --> 22:12.084
If there is no variety, it’s so boring
I tell you, so very boring.

22:12.285 --> 22:17.322
But they are very proud of it and they
think no end of themselves.

22:17.523 --> 22:21.820
They think they are very great people, they
have a sense of superiority,

22:22.021 --> 22:25.497
because they have a certain type of nose

22:25.697 --> 22:31.019
or maybe certain type of lips or maybe
certain types of hair.

22:31.220 --> 22:35.051
Such stupid things they are and you join
hands with them.

22:35.252 --> 22:37.104
How can you join hands with them?

22:37.305 --> 22:40.965
You want your freedom? Then be a free
person.

22:41.166 --> 22:47.219
In the freedom you have to have variety,
very important.

22:47.420 --> 22:51.660
I would say that, now, the Sahaja Yogis who
are going back to America

22:51.860 --> 22:57.950
should have a new style of drive: go
to the black people.

22:58.151 --> 23:03.272
I was very happy to see the South American
seminar,

23:03.473 --> 23:09.386
that they had taken specially to aboriginal
people.

23:09.587 --> 23:12.365
They went and met them. I have met them
also

23:12.566 --> 23:14.932
and I was so surprised

23:15.133 --> 23:18.880
that they immediately said, “Mother,
You are spiritual, we know,

23:19.081 --> 23:22.520
but can You solve our problem?” I said,
“What’s your problem?”

23:22.721 --> 23:27.061
“Very simple, we have a land.”
“It’s alright, then?”

23:27.262 --> 23:30.178
“Very little land, five, six acres of land

23:30.379 --> 23:33.365
that belongs to us where the sage grows.”

23:33.566 --> 23:40.053
Sage is a kind of a, according to them,
is a holy plant. All right.

23:40.254 --> 23:46.275
“Now, we always meet, all of us, there
for different festivals

23:46.476 --> 23:49.341
because we regard that land as a holy
land.”

23:49.542 --> 23:51.638
They know so many things, you know.

23:51.839 --> 23:55.671
This is a holy land - there were vibrations
for that.

23:55.871 --> 24:00.343
So they always used to meet. So natural!

24:00.544 --> 24:02.855
“So, what has happened now, what is your
problem?”

24:03.056 --> 24:08.210
“The government has sold this land, this
American government, to an Indian.”

24:08.411 --> 24:12.300
I said, “To an Indian?” “Yes, so can you
request this Indian

24:12.501 --> 24:14.891
to return it to us? We’ll pay him the
money.”

24:15.092 --> 24:17.067
I said, “What’s the name of the Indian?”

24:17.267 --> 24:20.174
They told me the name, I said, “My God!

24:20.375 --> 24:22.996
He is a Sindhi, Sindhi!

24:23.197 --> 24:27.221
He won’t leave you even one single pai,
is he going to give you this?

24:27.422 --> 24:33.262
I’m sorry, I may be Divine or I may be
anything, I can’t help you.”

24:33.793 --> 24:37.836
But I was surprised nobody raised a voice
against it.

24:38.037 --> 24:40.750
They should have raised voice. They should
have told the government,

24:40.951 --> 24:44.422
“Please return their land. Why do you want
to have it?

24:44.623 --> 24:50.395
Why want to grab it?” As it is all
the Americans are immigrants.

24:50.596 --> 24:56.607
They don’t belong to that place, that they
were not owners of that place,

24:56.808 --> 24:59.668
they’d gone – they are immigrants.

24:59.869 --> 25:03.649
So they have no right to keep somebody’s
land like that

25:03.850 --> 25:05.980
and then to think they are superior.
It’s very nice,

25:06.181 --> 25:09.012
somebody enters your house and thinks he is
very superior

25:09.213 --> 25:13.031
and drives out all the people
of the family.

25:13.232 --> 25:18.152
That is what has happened in America and
just opposite is Sahaj Dharma.

25:18.353 --> 25:25.918
With Sahaj Dharma, you take people into
your heart, you love them.

25:27.378 --> 25:32.551
Your love flows all the time, your
compassion flows all the time.

25:32.752 --> 25:37.050
To me it’s a problem, this body is more
compassionate than myself.

25:37.251 --> 25:41.120
I don’t even think of compassion and this
body just grasps everything.

25:41.342 --> 25:45.178
It wants to solve the problem of others

25:45.379 --> 25:49.437
but I don’t think you can have that kind
of a body, you shouldn’t have.

25:49.638 --> 25:54.377
But, at least you should have a heart
which is open.

25:54.578 --> 25:57.349
You see on the street somebody who is
a dark fellow.

25:57.549 --> 26:07.271
I like about the black Americans, that
once I got down in one airport,

26:07.472 --> 26:13.024
so one gentleman, black gentleman said,
“Hello darling, how are You?

26:13.225 --> 26:16.345
How are You here? Very happy to see You!”

26:16.546 --> 26:19.451
“I’m happy to see you. How are you?”

26:19.652 --> 26:29.866
Then once I was traveling in... what was
the airport? Ursula was with me.

26:30.067 --> 26:36.451
So he looked at me, one fellow, very tall,
hefty, fat, you know.

26:36.652 --> 26:40.703
He said, “Ah! Are You back again?” “Ah”.

26:40.904 --> 26:44.438
I said, “I’m back. You know me?”
“Of course, of course, I know You.”

26:44.639 --> 26:47.977
He had never met me, I had never known him.

26:50.326 --> 26:54.831
But I felt happy, I felt very happy.

26:55.032 --> 26:58.096
That’s the best way to meet people.

26:58.297 --> 27:03.341
Supposing you are walking on the street,
you see some black gentleman going.

27:03.542 --> 27:07.683
It’s a terrible life there, I tell you,
it’s a terrible life for them.

27:07.884 --> 27:13.197
I’ve known, I’ve read books on them, I’ve
cried and wept and I felt very sorry.

27:13.398 --> 27:16.853
So, as a Sahaja yogi, you should just jump
at them

27:17.054 --> 27:21.213
and you should say, “Hello, how are you?”
Shake hands with them.

27:21.413 --> 27:24.907
They won’t cut your throat, I can tell you
this.

27:26.482 --> 27:30.098
In criminality, I don’t know who is more
criminal in America,

27:30.299 --> 27:34.303
whether they are the blacks or
the whites, competing.

27:34.504 --> 27:37.753
But, if you are kind and if you are loving,

27:37.954 --> 27:41.056
you can remove that part of criminality
which is within them

27:41.257 --> 27:46.831
because hatred can be only washed away
by pure love.

27:47.068 --> 27:52.469
But people think they are very cunning,
very superior in cunningness, of course.

27:52.670 --> 27:56.304
Otherwise, what is their superiority?

27:57.499 --> 28:02.709
Only this complexion, this white complexion
is the worst of all.

28:02.910 --> 28:08.375
I was very fair, very fair, till I got
married, or for some time,

28:08.576 --> 28:11.490
and then I started becoming darker and
darker.

28:11.691 --> 28:15.078
Because white complexion gets all kinds
of, see...

28:15.279 --> 28:19.412
the light you put on me, I absorb, I get
a black spot.

28:19.613 --> 28:23.044
So it’s not a very great thing to be white,
I don’t think so.

28:23.245 --> 28:27.484
It looks very funny and pale and joyless.

28:27.685 --> 28:33.061
But no use going to the sea, making your
body, I think brown,

28:33.262 --> 28:42.220
brown, not so black, brown and then
suffering from cancer of the skin.

28:42.421 --> 28:47.418
This kind of stupidity is also very much
fashionable.

28:47.619 --> 28:52.002
Now, in collectivity, how much do we get
impressed

28:52.202 --> 28:56.025
by this, we should be on the watch.

28:56.485 --> 29:00.599
I saw my granddaughter was wearing
a sleeveless dress.

29:00.800 --> 29:02.962
I told her, “Better you shouldn’t wear
a sleeveless dress.”

29:03.163 --> 29:06.394
She says, “It’s very hot, I feel very hot.”
She’s young.

29:06.620 --> 29:10.086
I said, “But see, these are two very
important chakras.

29:10.287 --> 29:14.834
If you expose them, then you’ll have
a problem.”

29:15.035 --> 29:20.629
She doesn’t like to wear dresses which are
above the knee,

29:20.830 --> 29:22.982
but she says, “People wear even above
the knee.”

29:23.183 --> 29:29.568
I said, “Knees, they are very important
chakras, we should keep them closed,

29:29.769 --> 29:33.739
otherwise if they are affected, we’ll have
knee trouble.”

29:33.940 --> 29:36.946
Immediately she changed – immediately.

29:37.146 --> 29:41.555
“Mother, I’ll wear blouse from inside and
something from outside.”

29:41.756 --> 29:47.944
Immediately. Because she knew this is
a natural primordial taboo

29:48.145 --> 29:56.380
that we should not expose our these two
chakras and these chakras.

29:56.581 --> 30:04.560
But, nowadays, the more you have long
legs, I don’t know,

30:04.761 --> 30:07.628
they have shorter clothes.

30:07.829 --> 30:10.703
And I don’t understand what is in the legs,

30:10.904 --> 30:14.426
the whole beauty is in the legs or what?

30:14.635 --> 30:19.721
So, I’ve met one lady who traveled with me.

30:19.922 --> 30:23.765
She was wearing a burkha because she was
a Moslem

30:23.966 --> 30:28.406
and by the time we landed in London, she
took out the burkha

30:28.607 --> 30:32.759
and the dress was much above the knees.

30:32.960 --> 30:36.677
I said, “What kind of Muslim woman is she?

30:36.878 --> 30:43.127
She’s worse than even Christians because
they wouldn’t wear such a thing.

30:43.328 --> 30:46.512
You know, to come out of the aeroplane,

30:46.712 --> 30:48.697
you have to come down on the staircase.”

30:48.898 --> 30:55.151
No “Lajja”, no shame, nothing,
shamelessness!

30:55.571 --> 31:03.038
So, Sahaj Dharma is that you have shame,
you have sense of shame.

31:03.239 --> 31:06.169
What you talk to others, what you say
to others,

31:06.370 --> 31:13.399
how you behave towards them, in the Sahaj
Dharma is Alladha dayini.

31:13.629 --> 31:18.285
If something is not Alladha dayini, keep
quiet. Don’t say.

31:18.486 --> 31:23.312
What is the need? What is there to be
sarcastic?

31:23.513 --> 31:28.560
Showing off your brains in your sarcasm.

31:30.025 --> 31:33.831
It’s not a sign of good breeding

31:34.032 --> 31:38.820
that you talk sarcastically to others
in a sharp way.

31:39.021 --> 31:43.157
But if you talk sweetly, what’s the harm?

31:43.358 --> 31:48.719
This sweetness comes from Radhaji.

31:48.920 --> 31:51.793
Now, of course they have misused Her

31:51.993 --> 31:56.673
and made it into a sort of a Romeo and
Juliet business. It was not that way.

31:56.874 --> 32:03.129
She was a very pure woman and She
was Mahalakshmi.

32:03.330 --> 32:10.349
So, to be a Mahalaksmi, after coming
to Sahaja Yoga, you should know

32:10.550 --> 32:16.853
that you should dress up in a way that’s
perfectly alright.

32:17.054 --> 32:25.902
Once I remember, I was in a big party
and one gentleman came

32:26.116 --> 32:30.424
and he sat down, “Aaaaaah!” I said,
“What happened?”

32:30.625 --> 32:35.570
“What a relief, Mother, Mrs. Shrivastava,
to see You.

32:35.771 --> 32:43.092
See these women, I’m fed up. But You
came, I felt such a relief.”

32:43.464 --> 32:47.623
I said, “What is so relieving?” “You are
so serene.”

32:47.824 --> 32:54.068
So, women are serene in Sahaj Dharma.

32:54.269 --> 32:59.718
They are not stupid, frivolous, laughing
at anything.

32:59.919 --> 33:05.253
That’s not the way for a woman. Anything
happens, they must laugh.

33:05.453 --> 33:08.560
I mean, there is something laughable,
alright,

33:08.761 --> 33:12.042
but some things are not even laughable,
they laugh.

33:12.249 --> 33:17.266
That’s not the way. That can be ridiculous
also, can ridicule others.

33:17.467 --> 33:24.060
But, laugh of appreciation, laugh
of enjoyment,

33:24.261 --> 33:30.267
is so pure and creates such a beautiful
atmosphere.

33:30.468 --> 33:37.326
I think the whole ecological problem is in
our brains and your upbringing.

33:37.527 --> 33:40.512
It is not outside.

33:41.184 --> 33:46.465
It is inside us, which is reflected
outside.

33:46.666 --> 33:51.711
In Ganesha Puja I’m going to tell you how
we are so closely related to Mother Earth

33:51.912 --> 33:56.048
and how the Mother Earth and the atmosphere
reacts

33:56.249 --> 34:00.666
to our behavior, to how we live.

34:00.867 --> 34:07.366
In the Sahaj Dharma, you give up lust and
greed very easily, that I know.

34:07.567 --> 34:10.119
I mean, if they can’t even give up that,

34:10.320 --> 34:12.926
then they should not call themselves Sahaja
Yogis.

34:13.127 --> 34:16.502
The first thing you give up is lust and
greed.

34:16.703 --> 34:19.760
I find it among young people now,

34:19.961 --> 34:27.945
that those who come to Sahaja Yoga
become really very free people.

34:28.146 --> 34:32.004
They don’t run after women.

34:32.413 --> 34:34.914
Women don’t run after men.

34:35.115 --> 34:39.045
They are together, they sit together, talk
together, laugh together,

34:39.246 --> 34:42.468
but it is purity that is there.

34:42.669 --> 34:48.764
In the Koran it is described that when
Kyama will come,

34:49.375 --> 34:53.630
beautiful women and beautiful men will
be there,

34:53.831 --> 34:57.122
but they’ll have no lust and greed, they’ll
be pure.

34:57.323 --> 35:04.277
It is today, you can see – that lust and
greed is finished

35:04.478 --> 35:08.790
in most of you – most of you. Automatically
it is finished

35:08.991 --> 35:15.386
and now you can see for yourself that
you’re free of this bondage.

35:16.245 --> 35:20.253
Then our marriages are coming tomorrow.

35:29.957 --> 35:38.938
In the Sahaj Dharma, first thing is very
important is forgiveness.

35:39.139 --> 35:44.059
If somebody cannot forgive, then he cannot
be a Sahaja Yogi -

35:44.972 --> 35:49.533
forgiveness. How this forgiveness comes in

35:49.734 --> 35:54.929
is by forgetting the past. Otherwise you’ll
go on saying,

35:55.129 --> 35:58.480
“This person tortured me, that person
tortured me,

35:58.681 --> 36:03.452
he was very mean to me, he was that to me,
he did this to me.”

36:03.653 --> 36:09.015
Shows that you are not of that calibre
to understand Sahaja Yoga -

36:09.216 --> 36:12.533
because you cannot forgive.

36:13.259 --> 36:16.428
What is there to remember? The present is
the best.

36:16.629 --> 36:21.774
Now if you are sitting here with me,
enjoying the Alladha dayini Shakti,

36:21.975 --> 36:25.334
that time if you are thinking about
the past, shows what?

36:25.535 --> 36:28.608
That you are not of the calibre.

36:28.809 --> 36:34.144
To be the calibre of Sahaja Yoga, you
should be free of your past.

36:34.345 --> 36:37.872
Finished. There's no need to confess.

36:38.073 --> 36:42.536
I know after Sahaja Yoga many people wrote
letters to me of confessions

36:42.737 --> 36:47.212
and I just said, “Baba, just burn these
letters.

36:47.413 --> 36:51.957
I don’t remember. I don’t want to read
anything about anyone.”

36:52.158 --> 36:54.517
So, there should be forgiveness.

36:54.718 --> 36:57.357
If there is forgiveness, you’ll be
surprised,

36:57.558 --> 37:02.195
you’ll feel very relieved and your married
life will be very happy.

37:02.396 --> 37:06.362
But if you try to remember something...
Alright,

37:06.563 --> 37:11.161
some marriages are really, really very
difficult, alright, so you get out.

37:11.362 --> 37:14.655
In Sahaja Yoga we have allowed complete
divorce,

37:14.855 --> 37:17.178
but must be with some reason,

37:17.379 --> 37:20.570
not because you think something is
superior.

37:20.811 --> 37:24.680
Now we have banned many countries

37:24.880 --> 37:26.708
from where we don’t want to have girls

37:26.909 --> 37:28.994
or from where we don’t want to have boys.

37:29.195 --> 37:31.829
What is the reason? With experience we
have learned,

37:32.045 --> 37:36.681
they are not marriage substance.

37:38.106 --> 37:42.066
Now, then better not marry.

37:42.267 --> 37:48.542
And if you marry then live like an ideal
Sahaja Yogi.

37:49.058 --> 37:52.059
Also, if you are a Sahaja Yogini,

37:52.259 --> 37:58.654
then you can carry on very much better
by forgiving all the time.

37:58.855 --> 38:01.744
Every time, when people tell me,
“Mother,

38:01.944 --> 38:04.107
You see, You must help me.” “Why?”

38:04.329 --> 38:08.291
“Because, You know, my husband doesn’t
give me any money.”

38:08.492 --> 38:11.494
I said, “Give him up. I don’t mind.

38:11.695 --> 38:14.486
He must give you money. Why doesn’t he
give you money?”

38:14.687 --> 38:17.977
If you talk to the husband, he’ll say,
“Mother, she’s very extravagant.”

38:18.178 --> 38:24.390
I said, “You better give up Sahaja Yoga
both of you and do what you like.”

38:24.643 --> 38:30.991
In Sahaj Dharma, the husband-wife’s
relation should be really romantic,

38:31.192 --> 38:33.294
should be really beautiful.

38:33.495 --> 38:36.767
It is not, you know, we talk of love and
all that here,

38:36.968 --> 38:41.031
very rarely people fall in love and carry
on with it.

38:41.232 --> 38:45.721
It’s a blessing if you really get that kind
of a feeling.

38:45.922 --> 38:49.445
But mostly it is a curse.

38:50.878 --> 38:54.740
So to fall in love is very good

38:54.941 --> 38:59.049
but that doesn’t mean you forget that you
are a Sahaja Yogi.

38:59.250 --> 39:05.305
In that, Sahaja Yoga helps a lot, I think,
in your married life.

39:05.506 --> 39:10.888
Same, dharma is for your children, that you
bring up your children -

39:11.089 --> 39:16.006
not troubling them too much, but into
a free life.

39:16.207 --> 39:18.105
Let them use their wisdom.

39:18.306 --> 39:22.548
Sometimes I know children go astray and
try to follow wrong things.

39:22.749 --> 39:26.652
Then you must correct them, you must tell
them, it is your duty.

39:26.853 --> 39:29.371
They were not born out of the trees

39:29.572 --> 39:33.142
but they were born here, from the parents.

39:33.343 --> 39:36.895
So it is the duty of the parents to tell
them that this is wrong

39:37.096 --> 39:39.078
and this should not be done.

39:39.278 --> 39:42.275
It’s a very wrong thing, you should correct
that

39:42.476 --> 39:46.867
and that correction should be in a Sahaj
way.

39:48.461 --> 39:51.447
I’ll tell you an example.

39:53.118 --> 40:01.738
I had a problem once, with somebody
coming to me and saying,

40:01.939 --> 40:06.671
“Mother, I can’t do without smoking, I
have to smoke.”

40:06.872 --> 40:11.613
I said, “Better smoke then, but you can’t
be a Sahaja Yogi,

40:11.871 --> 40:15.291
because a smoking Sahaja Yogi is a funny
caricature, you know,

40:15.492 --> 40:18.448
I can’t think of a Sahaja Yogi smoking.

40:18.649 --> 40:23.973
How will I look if I start smoking like
that?” “Ah, horrible!”

40:24.174 --> 40:29.324
I said, “Then if you are my son, you cannot
smoke, it looks bad.”

40:29.525 --> 40:32.715
He gave up smoking, can you imagine?

40:32.916 --> 40:37.451
So, dealing with children, always make
yourself an example,

40:37.652 --> 40:40.684
yourself part and parcel of that event.

40:40.885 --> 40:44.410
So the children don’t feel, you know.

40:44.611 --> 40:53.713
This is something that I have talked
many-a-times.

40:53.914 --> 40:57.003
Children is one thing I tell you,

40:57.204 --> 41:01.340
they can give up everything but not your
love.

41:01.541 --> 41:08.267
If they know you love them, they will not
accept anything

41:08.467 --> 41:14.845
that will make you not love - not love
them.

41:15.046 --> 41:22.387
This is for definite, because children are
the best people who know about love.

41:22.588 --> 41:26.216
Of course, I don’t know, I feel that
in English language,

41:26.417 --> 41:32.825
I didn’t see many books about children
written beautiful, beautiful things.

41:33.026 --> 41:35.994
There was one book that was published
when I was in London:

41:36.195 --> 41:39.308
“The children talking about
the politicians”,

41:39.508 --> 41:45.186
and they published I think, 5000 books and
that very same day it was finished.

41:45.387 --> 41:51.651
So, talk to children, talk to them. You’ll
be amazed, they are full of honey.

41:51.852 --> 41:54.579
They have such nice, nice things with them

41:54.780 --> 41:59.411
and when they talk like that, then you
are amazed

41:59.612 --> 42:03.071
how they say things, how they talk
of Sahaj,

42:03.272 --> 42:11.256
how they are expressing their spiritual
strength.

42:12.546 --> 42:22.257
Now, we have many very good children and
also they are absolutely Sahaj.

42:22.610 --> 42:27.351
One boy came and he just prostrated himself
before me.

42:27.552 --> 42:29.174
So, I said, “Why you did it?”

42:29.375 --> 42:36.852
“I was getting cool vibrations, Mother,
from You, so I did it.”

42:37.053 --> 42:40.443
“Is it, you like it?”
“Of course!”

42:40.644 --> 42:44.122
“More than chocolate?”
“Of course!”

42:44.323 --> 42:47.724
I was surprised. “What... you eat them or
what?”

42:47.939 --> 42:52.493
“No, no need to eat, you know, you feel
so happy inside

42:52.694 --> 42:57.467
and I feel, Mother, You are putting Your
hand on my heart

42:57.668 --> 43:00.779
and trying to console me.”

43:00.980 --> 43:03.031
I was surprised. “And where is your heart?”

43:03.232 --> 43:07.366
He said, “It’s here, here is my heart,
I feel it here.”

43:07.567 --> 43:12.658
Just imagine, what love and what
understanding of Sahaja Yoga.

43:12.859 --> 43:18.107
For these little children who are below
even five years.

43:18.308 --> 43:21.270
Now, you are all grown up children of mine

43:21.471 --> 43:26.004
and I want you to know all the beauties
that are within you,

43:26.204 --> 43:30.114
that you have to enjoy. First of all, learn
to laugh at yourself.

43:30.315 --> 43:35.457
That’s the best way to enjoy yourself,
you know.

43:35.658 --> 43:43.094
And not to spend much time looking in
the mirror, that’s another way.

43:43.295 --> 43:46.480
You spend too much at the mirror, then
there’s something wrong with you.

43:46.681 --> 43:51.541
I think, personally, that it’s a kind of
a possession may be.

43:51.742 --> 43:57.871
So, what you should see inside: “Are we
Sahaj Dharmies?”

43:58.072 --> 44:00.621
Mother has established Sahaj Dharma,

44:00.822 --> 44:04.046
much more than what Krishna wanted
to establish.

44:04.247 --> 44:09.479
He wanted to establish the Dharma of love
which of course we have,

44:09.696 --> 44:14.739
but apart from that we have so many other
beautiful facets

44:14.940 --> 44:19.043
and such beautiful things within our
personality

44:19.243 --> 44:24.852
that we have forgotten to enjoy.

44:25.053 --> 44:31.685
So, the attention should be on your own
qualities, on your own personalities

44:31.886 --> 44:38.867
and then you’ll be amazed how your
personality is giving you joy,

44:39.068 --> 44:47.601
giving you Alladha, giving you so much
of patience with others.

44:48.326 --> 44:52.311
To Me the whole thing looks like sometimes
a joke

44:52.512 --> 44:57.022
because nothing so serious.

44:57.223 --> 45:00.947
It’s not a Rama’s type that you have
to be serious.

45:01.148 --> 45:09.094
I don’t have to kill anybody, I don’t use
any weapons in this lifetime.

45:09.423 --> 45:12.714
Without weapons if things are solved, what
can you do?

45:12.915 --> 45:16.122
But you must try to see the beauty
as Sahaja Yogis.

45:16.323 --> 45:21.007
You should be sensitive to see how you
have been helped,

45:21.208 --> 45:25.266
how you have been guided, how you have
been blessed.

45:25.466 --> 45:27.959
This is sahaj dharma.

45:28.160 --> 45:32.743
If you cannot know that, then you live
on a very low level.

45:32.944 --> 45:35.538
I mean, it’s not fault of Sahaja Yoga,

45:35.738 --> 45:39.763
but it’s your style, you are not sensitive.

45:40.590 --> 45:47.589
Supposing somebody does not know that he
is burning his hand.

45:48.482 --> 45:50.880
So what will you do?

45:51.080 --> 45:54.853
He has no sense, he has no sensitivity,
he cannot feel.

45:55.054 --> 45:58.787
He can drink, he can smoke, he can do
everything

45:58.988 --> 46:02.504
and still he Is existing, alright.

46:02.705 --> 46:07.550
Must be a rakshasa, I think or I don’t know
what to say.

46:07.751 --> 46:12.587
So, we have to take example from other good
Sahaja Yogis

46:12.788 --> 46:20.831
and not from the bad ones and how do we
proceed in enjoyment -

46:21.032 --> 46:24.235
which is a ocean, just an ocean.

46:24.436 --> 46:29.688
For example, now, I came, everybody was
trying to fan.

46:29.889 --> 46:31.990
But also in the West another problem is

46:32.191 --> 46:36.476
they like to live in hermetically sealed
rooms, hermetically sealed cars,

46:36.677 --> 46:40.663
they are very afraid of draught, I don’t
know, as if they’ll be thrown away

46:40.864 --> 46:44.278
or what will happen to them. They don’t
want draught.

46:44.479 --> 46:48.751
I mean draught is not coming from some
iceberg.

46:48.952 --> 46:53.104
So, they don’t believe in the fresh air
at all

46:53.305 --> 46:59.835
and that’s one other reason that people are
very suffocating sometimes, you know,

47:00.036 --> 47:04.022
they just suffocate. They are used
to a suffocating life.

47:04.223 --> 47:09.883
Once I was in India, I was very hot, so
somebody was driving me,

47:10.084 --> 47:14.824
but the person who was there was from
a Western country.

47:15.025 --> 47:17.720
He said, “Don’t open - don’t open
the window.”

47:17.921 --> 47:21.626
I said, “Why?” “There’s a draught.”
I said, “In this country, in India

47:21.827 --> 47:25.776
people live in the open. What is a draught?

47:25.977 --> 47:28.190
What draught you are talking about?”

47:28.391 --> 47:30.987
You can’t open the door, you can’t open
the window,

47:31.188 --> 47:34.212
you can’t open anything, if you open
anything,

47:34.412 --> 47:40.520
they’ll be all dead, you see as if.
So open yourself!

47:40.721 --> 47:46.381
As it is about the nature, also it is
in their private lives.

47:46.581 --> 47:49.532
They don’t want to open.

47:51.766 --> 47:53.965
If somebody comes to their house,
“Oh, my God,

47:54.166 --> 47:57.484
now we’ll have to share the wines,

47:57.685 --> 48:03.329
we’ll have to share the foods.” They cannot
share.

48:04.262 --> 48:11.143
They cannot share. That is most
uncollective.

48:13.241 --> 48:17.569
But in India, I must say, people have
a good sharing capacity

48:17.770 --> 48:23.873
because they are still primitive, they are
still primordial,

48:24.074 --> 48:32.507
yet not gone out of the way to satisfy
their own ego.

48:32.708 --> 48:38.828
But I think somehow or other in India,
people like to share.

48:46.911 --> 48:49.771
If you want to please any Indian, you tell
them,

48:49.972 --> 48:53.601
“tomorrow I’ll come and have food with
you.” His wife will jump.

48:53.802 --> 48:57.922
She’ll say, “Now what do you like, tell me,
what food do you like?”

48:58.122 --> 49:03.491
She will jump. But otherwise, what happens,

49:03.692 --> 49:06.869
as soon as you say he Is coming for food,
the wife will say,

49:07.070 --> 49:11.716
“No, no, I am going to my mother.”

49:13.628 --> 49:17.186
Immediately she’ll have a programme.

49:20.016 --> 49:23.427
I just don’t understand. They’ll have
beautiful houses,

49:23.628 --> 49:26.862
very clean, very beautiful everything,

49:27.063 --> 49:30.481
but if somebody comes to their house, they
get a shock

49:30.682 --> 49:37.870
as if electricity has entered. So, for whom
is all this?

49:39.089 --> 49:43.439
To show off, they will borrow money from
the banks.

49:43.640 --> 49:46.276
Even Indians in America they do.

49:46.477 --> 49:53.474
They want to have three Mercedes, four
houses, for what?

49:53.675 --> 49:57.048
Borrowing money, with borrowing money
they’ll do it.

49:57.249 --> 50:01.821
Sahaja Yogis have not to borrow any money.

50:03.342 --> 50:06.892
There is no need, you can do away with
things.

50:07.093 --> 50:09.919
Why to have so many cars?

50:10.119 --> 50:13.633
Nowadays, people don’t even walk at all.

50:13.834 --> 50:20.055
We used to go to our school, my father had
a car in India - nothing doing.

50:20.256 --> 50:23.140
We had to walk. We used to climb one
mountain.

50:23.341 --> 50:27.791
It was about five miles the school – every
morning.

50:27.997 --> 50:32.768
Then in the night, in the evening, the car
used to come, you see.

50:32.969 --> 50:36.258
And I would walk with my bare feet,

50:36.459 --> 50:40.119
because so much vibrations were there,
and the chappals,

50:40.320 --> 50:42.454
I thought were cutting my vibrations,

50:42.655 --> 50:47.371
so I used to have chappals in my hand and
walk.

50:47.572 --> 50:51.052
One day, we had a new driver, my father
sent him.

50:51.253 --> 50:53.755
He said, “How will I know who is
your daughter?”

50:53.956 --> 51:00.905
He said, “Any girl with the chappals in her
hand is the one whom you have to bring.”

51:01.106 --> 51:08.944
So, it is to enjoy your nobility, to enjoy
your generosity.

51:09.145 --> 51:14.090
It’s very important. And not to side
with anyone.

51:14.291 --> 51:17.660
You are not identified with anyone.

51:18.557 --> 51:23.119
It’s much better now, I think, because
since you have taken to Sahaj Dharma,

51:23.320 --> 51:26.910
I’ve seen - English will tell you what’s
wrong with English,

51:27.111 --> 51:29.638
Swiss will tell you what’s wrong with
Swiss,

51:29.839 --> 51:33.604
Indians will tell you what’s wrong with
Indians. Actually, I learnt from them.

51:33.805 --> 51:35.676
I don’t know these things are there.

51:35.876 --> 51:39.308
Russians will tell you what’s wrong with
Russians.

51:39.509 --> 51:43.639
They immediately start seeing, “What’s
wrong with us?

51:43.840 --> 51:47.097
Where do we lack in this?”

51:47.298 --> 51:54.719
Because the collectivity of being in one
country, say as an Indian,

51:55.192 --> 52:02.495
we see now, what’s happening in India,
all corrupt, horrible, this, that.

52:02.696 --> 52:05.185
So, I said, “Alright, if you don’t like
India, why don’t you go somewhere else?”

52:05.386 --> 52:08.216
“No, no, no, no, that - we will stay here,

52:08.417 --> 52:14.554
but this is a very corrupt government, they
are very bad, this, that.”

52:15.253 --> 52:19.652
Anywhere you go, you will find immediately
they see -

52:19.853 --> 52:28.132
because you don’t know they are now chosen
to change their country.

52:28.814 --> 52:33.319
I have taken up many questions now,
of India

52:33.520 --> 52:37.751
and I’m going to start working on that
level now.

52:37.952 --> 52:43.059
We have already started, in a way, for
the destitute women,

52:43.260 --> 52:46.022
then for other type of poverty and all
that.

52:46.223 --> 52:50.194
Just by saying, remove poverty, poverty
cannot be lost.

52:50.395 --> 52:54.639
You have to have feeling for the poor,
then only.

52:54.840 --> 53:00.949
But you get with more that feeling because
you are an Indian.

53:01.158 --> 53:05.581
You are an Indian, so what? Your own
brothers, sisters starving.

53:05.782 --> 53:11.043
You get that very deep feeling within you
if you are a Sahaj Dharmi.

53:11.244 --> 53:15.321
So, this is the new Dharma we have
established now in this world.

53:15.521 --> 53:20.270
A new race, with a new Dharma, which is
much above

53:20.471 --> 53:24.665
even Shri Krishna’s vision is coming
through.

53:24.866 --> 53:30.296
He describes in the beginning. I think,
He was not a good salesman,

53:30.497 --> 53:32.820
because He describes the best first;

53:33.021 --> 53:36.956
you see, the salesman first will start from
two rupees,

53:37.157 --> 53:41.905
then go onward to two thousand rupies.
But He first told us

53:42.106 --> 53:46.163
that you have to become Sthita Pragnya,
means Sahaja Yogi -

53:46.363 --> 53:50.834
and then Shri Krishna was asked a question
by Arjuna,

53:51.035 --> 53:54.681
“What is a Sthita Pragya?” Then He
describes a Sahaja Yogi,

53:54.882 --> 53:59.074
that He describes before, first chapter,
second chapter is that.

53:59.275 --> 54:06.303
Now, then the questions start. You know,
Arjuna was a great questioner, I think.

54:06.504 --> 54:09.210
So, he starts asking questions, “Then what
about this

54:09.410 --> 54:11.819
and what about that and what about that?”

54:12.020 --> 54:15.489
So He goes on explaining to him that,

54:15.690 --> 54:22.184
“You see, this is all just a Maya, this is
all an illusion you have.

54:22.385 --> 54:24.982
Get out of this illusion.

54:25.183 --> 54:29.011
If once you get out of this illusion,”
because Arjuna said,

54:29.212 --> 54:33.841
“They are my relations, they are my
teachers. How can I kill them?”

54:34.042 --> 54:36.614
So, Krishna says, “Nobody is killed.”

54:36.815 --> 54:39.793
He said, “Nobody is killed, but they are
being killed

54:39.994 --> 54:44.880
because they are not following the Satya
Dharma, so it’s alright.”

54:45.081 --> 54:47.184
What is your brother, what is your sister?

54:47.385 --> 54:49.671
They are not following the Satya Dharma,

54:49.877 --> 54:51.533
so you have nothing to do with them.

54:51.734 --> 54:55.839
If you can correct them and help them,
it’s alright, otherwise forget them.

54:56.039 --> 55:00.465
First, deal with people who are straight.

55:00.666 --> 55:06.374
Like we should say that we must deal with
people who are simple, innocent

55:06.575 --> 55:11.890
and then you can take to difficult people
when you are that good.

55:12.091 --> 55:13.999
Otherwise you will come here saying,
“Mother,

55:14.199 --> 55:16.242
I have caught this, I have caught that.”

55:16.443 --> 55:19.136
So, in Sahaj Dharma, you being the Spirit,

55:19.337 --> 55:25.475
you also know about others, very well
and you can make it out,

55:25.676 --> 55:28.844
who is who, what chakras they are catching.

55:29.045 --> 55:35.510
But the trouble in America, I found that
Sahaja Yogis used to,

55:35.711 --> 55:40.786
just could go and tell somebody, “You are
catching on this chakra.”

55:40.987 --> 55:43.058
Now, he has come for the first time and you
tell him,

55:43.259 --> 55:46.895
“You, you are very egoistical.” He says,
“How do you know?”

55:47.096 --> 55:50.835
“Your Agnya is catching.” Maybe, his own
Agnya might be catching.

55:51.036 --> 55:54.022
Is this the way to receive a new person?

55:54.223 --> 55:57.978
Is this the way to talk to a new person?

55:58.179 --> 56:00.869
See, on the contrary, you should say,
“Come, sit down,

56:01.069 --> 56:03.826
very nice, you are very great, see?”

56:04.027 --> 56:09.275
Because they are still ignorant, so they
like some sort of

56:09.476 --> 56:14.525
buttering, as you call it, you see, we call
it chaplusi. Then, gradually,

56:14.726 --> 56:19.765
because you are doing this just to make
him a Sahaja Yogi,

56:20.022 --> 56:22.662
because you love him. Basically that is
the reason.

56:22.862 --> 56:25.166
But as soon as somebody comes in,
if you tell him,

56:25.367 --> 56:29.061
“This is wrong with you, that’s wrong
with you.”

56:29.262 --> 56:33.506
This is not a Pope’s business,

56:33.706 --> 56:36.268
where you go on telling people what’s
wrong with them,

56:36.469 --> 56:38.966
go and confess. To whom?

56:39.167 --> 56:41.919
To all these silly people. It’s not that.

56:42.120 --> 56:46.828
What we have to show; that you have fallen
in love with that person,

56:47.029 --> 56:50.686
you are nice to that person because you
like that person.

56:50.887 --> 56:53.258
Then gradually you pull him up.

56:53.459 --> 56:57.305
But as soon as he comes you give him one
shot, so finished.

56:57.506 --> 57:00.667
How can you have good relations?

57:00.868 --> 57:02.174
Americans have to learn this.

57:02.375 --> 57:05.716
I don’t know why Americans think they are
very superior people.

57:05.917 --> 57:11.046
I tell you for wisdom I would not say they
are so much.

57:11.247 --> 57:14.137
It’s completely lacking – wisdom in them.

57:14.338 --> 57:18.705
And they misunderstand people very fast,

57:18.906 --> 57:23.377
start judging others, is not the way you
can have Sahaj Dharma.

57:23.578 --> 57:27.837
Sahaj Dharma is – you are your own. You
are in your own,

57:28.038 --> 57:31.048
you are in your own realm and in your
happiness and joy.

57:31.278 --> 57:35.215
Where is the time to criticise others?

57:35.738 --> 57:42.143
So the best thing is to show your maximum
love to everyone.

57:42.344 --> 57:45.210
In that love, you should not show your pity

57:45.411 --> 57:49.229
but love which is again: Alladha dayini.

57:49.430 --> 57:53.805
This is the message of Shri Krishna but
I don’t know how many understood it.

57:54.005 --> 58:00.182
Now, what you find those who are following
Shri Krishna, like Hare Rama people,

58:00.400 --> 58:03.447
they are really beggars on the street.

58:03.648 --> 58:08.296
He is Kubera, and his disciples are all
beggars, can you imagine.

58:08.497 --> 58:11.945
Does it add to His glory as Kubera?

58:12.146 --> 58:15.764
So, Sahaja Yogis are not like that.

58:16.125 --> 58:23.709
Should be generous, should not bother too
much about yourself.

58:23.910 --> 58:26.635
Should not all the time think about
yourself,

58:26.836 --> 58:32.277
but think of the collectivity, how you
behave.

58:34.816 --> 58:39.894
Collectivity is not to bring – force people
to come to Sahaja Yoga.

58:40.095 --> 58:43.866
Once they come to Sahaja Yoga they will
know the joy of life

58:44.067 --> 58:47.625
and you don’t have to tell them anything.
Nothing has to be told,

58:47.826 --> 58:53.484
just silently it will work and they will
feel your love.

58:53.904 --> 58:57.325
You see, love is something so great.

58:57.526 --> 59:03.391
It not only helps others but it also
helps you.

59:03.597 --> 59:07.059
It’s so joyous to give realisation to
others.

59:07.260 --> 59:09.699
But if you start telling, “Your this chakra
is catching”,

59:09.900 --> 59:11.309
why are you giving realisation?

59:11.510 --> 59:15.622
If you don’t know how to give realisation,
better not do it.

59:15.823 --> 59:21.988
So, to criticise is not the way we can
enjoy love.

59:22.189 --> 59:25.992
Ah, of course you can pull the legs of each
other sometimes,

59:26.193 --> 59:29.961
just for fun’s sake, but not to harm,

59:30.162 --> 59:36.623
not to torture, not to make that person
fall.

59:37.663 --> 59:42.548
You are all Sahaj Dharmies, you have
accepted Sahaj Dharma

59:42.749 --> 59:50.304
and in Sahaj Dharma we have to have
pure love of the heart,

59:50.505 --> 59:56.563
not hypocrisy, and a sensible life.

59:56.764 --> 01:00:01.594
Now, this Pope is against abortion.
I’m not.

01:00:02.689 --> 01:00:05.874
If a woman is suffering, let her have
abortion.

01:00:06.075 --> 01:00:10.985
The one who is living is more important
than the ones who are not living.

01:00:11.239 --> 01:00:17.161
If somebody wants to have abortion, that
child can be born again.

01:00:17.362 --> 01:00:22.179
According to us, nobody dies permanently,

01:00:23.299 --> 01:00:25.152
whatever it may be.

01:00:25.353 --> 01:00:34.556
So, this is one way they use it for
propagation of human beings.

01:00:34.757 --> 01:00:37.750
Like they say the Moslem women are
a like a factory.

01:00:37.951 --> 01:00:40.955
They go on producing more children, more
children, more children.

01:00:41.170 --> 01:00:45.223
So there are more voters.

01:00:45.424 --> 01:00:48.984
So the Pope knows that. That’s why he
says, “Abortion, No.”

01:00:49.185 --> 01:00:51.838
Christians should not abort, because
then there will be

01:00:52.039 --> 01:00:58.877
less Christians to compete with
the Moslems.

01:01:00.062 --> 01:01:05.540
But in Sahaja Yoga, we don’t have such
funny, radical, nonsensical things.

01:01:05.741 --> 01:01:11.148
We have divorce, and we have also abortion,

01:01:11.349 --> 01:01:19.755
which is important to understand that these
are all taboos which are there.

01:01:19.956 --> 01:01:26.905
But not for people who have to get out
of the troubles –

01:01:27.106 --> 01:01:31.902
you have to help them. Then that’s how
it works.

01:01:32.103 --> 01:01:35.159
But to be very frank, we don’t have to do
abortions,

01:01:35.359 --> 01:01:40.263
it is achieved by Paramchaitanya.

01:01:40.464 --> 01:01:44.330
Paramchaitanya does for me. I don’t have
to.

01:01:44.531 --> 01:01:47.839
I don’t have to do anything. It’s
Paramchaitanya.

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:54.410
It’s nice because it knows what is to be
done, how to achieve it.

01:01:54.611 --> 01:01:57.309
And sometimes you are in trouble, then know

01:01:57.509 --> 01:02:01.105
that you are not leaving things into the
hands of the Paramchaitanya.

01:02:01.306 --> 01:02:03.244
If you leave it into the hands
of Paramchaitanya

01:02:03.444 --> 01:02:07.305
things will work out very well.

01:02:07.714 --> 01:02:10.864
So, to understand Sahaja Yoga, first and
foremost thing is,

01:02:11.064 --> 01:02:14.971
how much you are enjoying yourself?

01:02:15.172 --> 01:02:19.464
How much enjoyment are you giving
to others?

01:02:20.199 --> 01:02:23.423
For that you have music, you have this,
that.

01:02:23.624 --> 01:02:25.874
I was saying that today I won’t speak much,

01:02:26.075 --> 01:02:31.732
but, somehow, with Shri Krishna you can’t
keep quiet.

01:02:33.157 --> 01:02:43.014
He played Murli, Bansuri, flute. Look
at Him.

01:02:43.215 --> 01:02:48.553
I talked to you, but He just played Murli.

01:02:48.754 --> 01:02:54.362
He didn’t talk so much, except for
the Gita, you won’t find Him talking.

01:02:54.563 --> 01:02:58.959
And those who read also Gita are horrible
people, I tell you, I have met,

01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:03.769
those who read Gita. They don’t understand
what Shri Krishna’s Dharma is.

01:03:03.970 --> 01:03:08.329
If they don’t understand Shri Krishna, how
will they understand Sahaja Yoga?

01:03:08.530 --> 01:03:17.480
So, for all of you is to practice on love,

01:03:17.826 --> 01:03:26.563
on forgiveness, on appreciating others,
on giving joy to others.

01:03:26.764 --> 01:03:30.861
Some of the Sahaja Yogis have been very
kind to me also.

01:03:31.062 --> 01:03:34.723
Once I went to the shop to buy a sari,
for myself

01:03:34.924 --> 01:03:42.295
and the sari was very expensive for my
purpose. So, I didn’t buy.

01:03:42.496 --> 01:03:48.737
Said, “Let it be. This colour suits me,
alright, but it doesn’t matter.”

01:03:48.938 --> 01:03:51.719
I didn’t have so much money to buy that.

01:03:52.036 --> 01:03:55.109
So, that Sahaja Yogi bought that sari

01:03:55.310 --> 01:03:59.243
and on my birthday gave me – and really,
I could not see

01:03:59.444 --> 01:04:05.834
because my eyes were filled with tears.
Just a small thing like that.

01:04:06.245 --> 01:04:09.855
Normally I don’t expect you to do
anything for me, no.

01:04:10.056 --> 01:04:13.493
But small, small things make you so happy.

01:04:13.694 --> 01:04:16.498
But even if you do this to somebody, may
not understand,

01:04:16.699 --> 01:04:18.861
may not realize, may not feel it.

01:04:19.062 --> 01:04:23.212
But if you are a Sahaja Yogi, you will.

01:04:24.058 --> 01:04:30.202
So thank you very much; for all this that
I have said to you,

01:04:30.403 --> 01:04:35.358
try to enjoy yourself and make others
enjoy you.

01:04:35.559 --> 01:04:37.742
May God bless you.
