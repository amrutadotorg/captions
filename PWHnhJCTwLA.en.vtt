00:00:06.296 --> 00:00:18.416
I belong to a family of very enlightened
people. My father was linguist and he was

00:00:18.416 --> 00:00:27.560
master of 14 languages. He knew about 26
languages and he translated even Quran-e-Sharif

00:00:28.394 --> 00:00:40.234
into Hindi language. My mother was, in
those days, was a honors in Mathematics.

00:00:40.722 --> 00:00:52.862
So, both were very well educated and
enlightened people. At the time of My birth,

00:00:55.204 --> 00:01:03.824
My mother dreamt something which she could
not explain but after that she had a great

00:01:03.824 --> 00:01:12.634
desire to go and see a tiger in the open
field. My father was a great hunter because

00:01:12.634 --> 00:01:18.600
tigers were a menace in the area where we
were living, it was a hill station called

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.771
Chhindwara. So there was a king, who was
very much interested in my father. Somehow

00:01:24.771 --> 00:01:30.777
or other a letter came that, "There's a
tiger, very big tiger that has appeared

00:01:30.777 --> 00:01:36.991
and they're frightened of him that he
might be a man-eater." So, My father took

00:01:36.991 --> 00:01:45.312
My mother and Me to that place and they
were sitting, what we call, as a machaan,

00:01:45.312 --> 00:01:52.075
where they built something for people to
sit on top of a tree from where they can

00:01:52.075 --> 00:02:01.589
shoot nicely. And then My mother tells Me
that a big, huge tiger of a very big size

00:02:02.025 --> 00:02:08.785
very beautifully appeared on the field and
she felt tremendous love for the tiger.

00:02:09.585 --> 00:02:19.255
It was a full moon day and she felt
extremely compassionate towards the tiger

00:02:19.907 --> 00:02:25.207
and when My father raised his gun to shoot,
she stopped him and she wouldn't allow him

00:02:25.608 --> 00:02:32.528
and the tiger went away and he never
came to that forest again but that made

00:02:32.528 --> 00:02:39.924
My father think because he himself was a
realized soul that must be somebody,

00:02:41.732 --> 00:02:51.512
what we call a Goddess Durga, who's fond of a
tiger, must be born to My mother because

00:02:51.512 --> 00:02:56.233
the symptoms were rather funny that a
lady should like to see a tiger and all.

00:02:56.767 --> 00:03:01.217
So, he told My mother, "Now, are you satisfied
because they were struggling with the gun."

00:03:01.217 --> 00:03:07.922
He said, "Is there a Durga sitting in your
womb that you are trying to protect the tiger?"

00:03:07.922 --> 00:03:13.002
She said, "Yes, yes, so stop it now. I
won't allow you." Like that there were

00:03:13.002 --> 00:03:20.752
many incidents in My life because I'm of
a Christian family, Protestants and when

00:03:20.752 --> 00:03:24.969
I was born, My mother didn't feel any labor
pains or anything and just I was born, She

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:31.100
didn't know how and I had no blood on My
body, nothing. I was clean washed that's why

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:37.326
they called My name as Nirmala but My
grandmother said that, "She should be

00:03:37.326 --> 00:03:43.070
called as Nishkalanka - that means 'The
one which has no spots on it' but that's

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.361
the name of a man, so they said, "Alright,
we'll call Her Nirmala, meaning the same,

00:03:47.361 --> 00:03:54.068
Immaculata." Now all these incidents and
then My father being a realized soul,

00:03:54.591 --> 00:04:04.781
he felt tremendous vibrations from Me and
he felt that this life is great and She

00:04:04.781 --> 00:04:10.844
will do something great in this life. I do
not know why but I don't know if he dreamt

00:04:10.844 --> 00:04:16.520
or he understood it but all the time, if
I remember, when he talked to Me, he used

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:22.968
to say that, "You have to find out a way
of giving enmasse realization," all the time.

00:04:23.609 --> 00:04:30.299
As I told you, he was a great scholar of
so many things and a very widely read man,

00:04:30.493 --> 00:04:38.518
so he gave Me a good education in
religion, in different religions and also

00:04:38.518 --> 00:04:44.714
good education about human-beings, what are
their problems, why they react like this,

00:04:44.714 --> 00:04:49.432
why don't they take to God, why are they
hypocritical, all kinds of things he

00:04:49.432 --> 00:04:55.909
talked to Me. He also knew about Kundalini
but not so much. Of course, when I was

00:04:55.909 --> 00:05:03.940
born, I knew about Kundalini Myself, I
knew all about it from My very childhood.

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:09.414
I was very aware person, extremely aware
but I didn't know whom to talk to because

00:05:09.414 --> 00:05:13.515
you see people didn't have that awareness;
You can't talk to everyone like that.

00:05:14.158 --> 00:05:19.298
So, I was regarded as a very jolly person,
at the same time, very serious also

00:05:19.298 --> 00:05:24.809
very deep and then I started 
My studies as a child.
