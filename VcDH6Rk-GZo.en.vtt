00:00.000 --> 00:01.000
Evening Program, Eve of Sahastrara, 04-05-1985

01:26:24.470 --> 01:26:27.711
Do you know the meaning of this one?

01:26:27.911 --> 01:26:31.030
We have the translation.

01:26:31.230 --> 01:26:32.831
Oh, I see.

01:26:35.444 --> 01:26:37.844
But the one thing is there now, you see.

01:26:38.003 --> 01:26:40.684
It has to be rhythmic, otherwise,

01:26:40.884 --> 01:26:45.003
if it is not proper rhyme and also,

01:26:45.203 --> 01:26:48.804
in a proper rhythm, as you say taal.

01:26:49.003 --> 01:26:54.003
Any music, say it's English, it's western, whatever it is.

01:26:54.243 --> 01:26:57.923
It has to have that link.

01:26:58.123 --> 01:27:02.884
In the western music, whatever was composed

01:27:03.083 --> 01:27:06.804
they used to us beats i think, in the older times.

01:27:07.003 --> 01:27:10.404
But in the modern times there are no beats.

01:27:10.604 --> 01:27:13.644
There is no mariadas, nothing.

01:27:13.844 --> 01:27:17.083
So in our Sahaja Yoga songs

01:27:17.283 --> 01:27:22.923
you all must have mariadas, you cannot just sing something

01:27:23.163 --> 01:27:24.604
without any beat.

01:27:24.804 --> 01:27:27.444
You must definitely have beats.

01:27:27.644 --> 01:27:30.604
If it is a 4-beat sound or it's a,

01:27:30.804 --> 01:27:32.283
I don't know how many beats you have,

01:27:32.484 --> 01:27:34.283
but we have a least 28 also.

01:27:34.484 --> 01:27:36.203
I mean, ours is overcomplicated.

01:27:36.404 --> 01:27:39.764
But doesn't matter, you need not do that, 28 is too much.

01:27:39.963 --> 01:27:43.163
But up to 16 is simple.

01:27:43.363 --> 01:27:47.003
So it must be in beats first of all,

01:27:47.203 --> 01:27:50.604
and the tune should be as such, that it should form a melody.

01:27:50.724 --> 01:27:51.604
That's important.

01:27:51.804 --> 01:27:57.003
Because any tune anywhere, going anywhere, moving anywhere.

01:27:57.203 --> 01:27:59.644
You see, this kind of composition takes your mind

01:27:59.844 --> 01:28:01.564
from this to that, to that, to that.

01:28:01.764 --> 01:28:06.444
But if it's a melody so you come back again on the Sam.

01:28:06.644 --> 01:28:12.083
On the same point, again, on the same theme, you see.

01:28:12.283 --> 01:28:15.444
When you come back on the same theme, it's something like

01:28:15.644 --> 01:28:20.163
your attention is on your spirit.

01:28:20.363 --> 01:28:21.363
The same time.

01:28:21.604 --> 01:28:24.203
So the music now, whatever you compose

01:28:24.444 --> 01:28:26.684
should have a rhythmic movement,

01:28:26.884 --> 01:28:29.404
which should not go out of rhythm, you see, should not.

01:28:29.604 --> 01:28:32.564
So you should be able to make a thing to beats.

01:28:32.764 --> 01:28:35.083
But I like this new thing that you have.

01:28:35.323 --> 01:28:37.764
In that one is, what you call that?

01:28:37.963 --> 01:28:39.524
That you use.

01:28:39.844 --> 01:28:42.484
Guitar!

01:28:42.684 --> 01:28:46.884
Guitar is the one thing I see, that it gives you that beat.

01:28:47.083 --> 01:28:49.804
And in the all modern music, I'm very happy to know,

01:28:50.003 --> 01:28:52.644
they're very particular on the beat.

01:28:52.844 --> 01:28:57.203
That's very important, because beat gives you the balance,

01:28:57.404 --> 01:29:00.564
it gives you the discipline of the music,

01:29:00.764 --> 01:29:03.083
it makes everybody sing all right

01:29:03.283 --> 01:29:07.323
and it keeps you in proportion to the whole music.

01:29:07.524 --> 01:29:11.764
Otherwise, one goes like a long tail of kangaroo,

01:29:11.963 --> 01:29:14.884
another one goes like a small little tail of a rat,

01:29:15.083 --> 01:29:16.083
then another one...

01:29:16.243 --> 01:29:20.283
You see, it is not easy to follow such a music, people get confused.

01:29:20.484 --> 01:29:23.123
So because our music is for the masses,

01:29:23.323 --> 01:29:26.123
our music is not for a few connoisseurs, you see,

01:29:26.323 --> 01:29:27.644
it is for the masses.

01:29:27.844 --> 01:29:31.083
It has to be in rhythmic built in such a way,

01:29:31.283 --> 01:29:33.844
that the talas or whatever you call the beats,

01:29:34.043 --> 01:29:36.844
have to be properly done and that's why

01:29:37.003 --> 01:29:39.604
the modern music is so much appreciated.

01:29:39.804 --> 01:29:42.564
I tell you, there is nothing in this so called modern music,

01:29:42.724 --> 01:29:46.003
but is the rhythm with which they capture the heart.

01:29:46.243 --> 01:29:50.283
And the rhythm is Anahat, it goes with the Anahat, I see.

01:29:50.484 --> 01:29:57.123
Heartbeat, is the beating of the [vana?],

01:29:57.283 --> 01:30:01.163
is the beating of the force within you, which makes the sound.

01:30:01.363 --> 01:30:04.003
And that's why beats are very important

01:30:04.203 --> 01:30:08.884
and as you know, that it is described in the Devi Mahatmyam about me,

01:30:09.083 --> 01:30:14.884
that very particular about taal. Tala [...], tie in the taal.

01:30:15.083 --> 01:30:19.003
Because we have to be with Spirit, which is in taal, always.

01:30:19.203 --> 01:30:23.123
You should not go out of tune, you should not go out of tala also.

01:30:23.323 --> 01:30:28.363
So, whenever you compose any music make a taal, some sort of a beat.

01:30:28.564 --> 01:30:31.564
Keep to that thing, is better to have the taal, is a good idea.

01:30:31.764 --> 01:30:34.083
For that keeps you in the same rhythm

01:30:34.283 --> 01:30:37.083
and you will see, that it will be much more appreciated

01:30:37.283 --> 01:30:38.524
in the masses.

01:30:38.724 --> 01:30:40.884
Then in sort of a,

01:30:41.083 --> 01:30:43.804
I mean we don't have few people, now we have many.

01:30:44.003 --> 01:30:51.083
So to appeal to the masses, we have to have music that will have a

01:30:51.283 --> 01:30:53.283
rhythmic building up.

01:30:53.484 --> 01:30:55.163
Tala [...].

01:30:55.363 --> 01:30:58.524
And you will see people will appreciate it very much.

01:30:58.724 --> 01:31:01.123
I'm very happy it's working out so well and

01:31:01.323 --> 01:31:06.323
last time in the Easter the people from,

01:31:06.524 --> 01:31:09.923
in [...] played the kind and it turn out to be very nice.

01:31:10.123 --> 01:31:12.243
You must have heard about, turned out very nice.

01:31:12.444 --> 01:31:14.684
So let us start with that kind of a thing,

01:31:14.884 --> 01:31:19.604
when youâ€™re [rooted?] on the guitar [tied?], have beats there.

01:31:19.804 --> 01:31:21.923
You will see that it will make a

01:31:22.043 --> 01:31:24.444
wonderful movement of the Kundalini, in a proper way.

01:31:24.564 --> 01:31:27.003
Because poor Kundalini does not know what to do now,

01:31:27.163 --> 01:31:31.083
it moves like that, then it suddenly comes up, then goes...

01:31:31.283 --> 01:31:34.083
So this are different times and according to that times

01:31:34.283 --> 01:31:39.524
we have to compose our music, all right.

01:31:39.724 --> 01:31:42.363
None of the English people are here with any music as such I see,

01:31:42.564 --> 01:31:46.083
what has happened?

01:31:46.283 --> 01:31:52.724
The one [...], because you must be the guitarist, always.

01:31:52.923 --> 01:31:55.684
Yes , i have this here. Yes, you should.

01:31:55.884 --> 01:31:58.363
[...] you can't use it for Indian music, you can.

01:31:58.564 --> 01:31:59.283
Yes i can.

01:31:59.444 --> 01:32:02.524
Very easy, I mean it's just to play.

01:32:02.724 --> 01:32:05.963
It's very good, it keeps the rhythm on. Guitar must be there.

01:32:06.163 --> 01:32:09.083
Like a tabla, the tabla is more complicated as you see,

01:32:09.283 --> 01:32:13.203
that it has got so many...

01:32:13.404 --> 01:32:17.163
But Indian music cannot be without rhythm.

01:32:17.363 --> 01:32:20.804
First of all they have the vistara, the expansion.

01:32:21.003 --> 01:32:23.484
But then, it must be built.

01:32:23.684 --> 01:32:28.243
If you doesn't play with tala, you are not regarded as a musician.

01:32:28.444 --> 01:32:30.003
You must have tala.

01:32:30.203 --> 01:32:32.363
Because it has something to do with Shiva,

01:32:32.564 --> 01:32:34.243
it has something to do with your heart,

01:32:34.444 --> 01:32:38.524
it has something to do with Sahaja Yoga.

01:32:38.724 --> 01:32:41.123
You have to working with the heart, you tell that.

01:32:41.363 --> 01:33:39.123
[Gregoire translates to french...]

01:33:42.003 --> 01:33:46.363
Moreover, you see, when the Kundalini rises she makes the music.

01:33:46.564 --> 01:33:49.564
Because, Sa - Re - Ga - Ma- Pa - Dha - Ni - Sa, you see.

01:33:49.764 --> 01:33:53.923
She makes the music, when she rises into the seven notes

01:33:54.123 --> 01:33:56.963
and at the Saharara it is Ni, just imagine.

01:33:57.163 --> 01:34:01.243
In Sanskrit, in our Indian music we call it Ni, before the,

01:34:01.444 --> 01:34:03.844
which she comes to the final taal.

01:34:04.003 --> 01:34:07.564
So these seven notes are played by Kundalini

01:34:07.764 --> 01:34:11.564
and the tala is done by the Spirit.

01:34:11.764 --> 01:34:25.163
[Gregoire translates to french...]

01:34:25.404 --> 01:34:27.083
So now if you start singing this is

01:34:27.283 --> 01:34:29.804
[...] and all that left sided you start [blowing/flowing?].

01:34:30.003 --> 01:34:32.163
then you start breaking [UNCLEAR]

01:34:32.323 --> 01:34:34.564
song on the right side of aggression

01:34:34.764 --> 01:34:37.963
then you start moving on the right, then onto the left.

01:34:38.163 --> 01:34:42.923
So that's not the way, we have to move with the melody

01:34:43.163 --> 01:34:46.884
in the center and with the taal.

01:34:47.082 --> 01:34:49.922
So the Kundalini dances properly.

01:34:50.122 --> 01:35:02.844
[Gregoire translates to french...]

01:35:03.003 --> 01:35:05.884
This is what we have to realize, that we are Sahaja Yogis and

01:35:06.083 --> 01:35:09.123
Sahaja yogis cannot have all kinds of patterns.

01:35:09.323 --> 01:35:15.804
Now we cannot have also primitive music, I would say

01:35:16.003 --> 01:35:21.043
of the jungles, like dam dam dam..., like that,  we cannot have.

01:35:21.243 --> 01:35:24.804
Because that may be for the bhoots.

01:35:25.003 --> 01:35:28.604
It should not be frightening, that one thing is important.

01:35:28.844 --> 01:35:32.804
Should not be frightening, but it should be divine.

01:35:33.003 --> 01:35:40.323
So that it is blissful, it is satisfying

01:35:40.524 --> 01:35:46.003
and also giving you assurance.

01:35:46.243 --> 01:36:15.764
[Gregoire translates to french...]

01:36:15.963 --> 01:36:19.484
Moreover the music should not be like, ki-ki-ki again stop,

01:36:19.684 --> 01:36:22.764
ki-ki-ki again stop, is not [UNCLEAR].

01:36:22.963 --> 01:36:25.564
Because there should be continuous flow on the Kundalini,

01:36:25.764 --> 01:36:29.083
otherwise she doesn't understand.

01:36:29.283 --> 01:36:42.283
[Gregoire translates to french...]

01:36:42.484 --> 01:36:46.923
Say, it should be continuous

01:36:47.003 --> 01:36:49.283
music, but of course if the [...] is there

01:36:49.484 --> 01:36:51.404
you can have a little pause.

01:36:51.524 --> 01:36:56.684
But it should not be that you are breaking every note.

01:36:56.884 --> 01:36:58.844
[Stand outs?...] can be separated

01:36:59.003 --> 01:37:02.404
but not every note. It must merge from one to another.

01:37:02.604 --> 01:37:04.884
Like one from one chakra to another chakra,

01:37:05.083 --> 01:37:09.484
it should merge, one sentence to another sentence.

01:37:09.684 --> 01:37:13.323
But once you have come to a [...], means you have done

01:37:13.524 --> 01:37:18.524
one rising, then for the second one again the same style.

01:37:18.724 --> 01:37:21.923
It should not be that somewhere you go straight very fast,

01:37:22.083 --> 01:37:23.923
then just stop for nothing at all.

01:37:24.123 --> 01:37:37.404
[Gregoire translates to french...]

01:37:37.564 --> 01:37:40.363
So it should be purposeful music, it should not be purposeless,

01:37:40.564 --> 01:37:43.644
just played for fun or just played, expressing something,

01:37:43.844 --> 01:37:46.163
some sort of a funny experience.

01:37:46.363 --> 01:37:49.083
It should be the experience of the Spirit, it should be expressed

01:37:49.283 --> 01:37:52.724
in a most purposeful manner.

01:37:52.923 --> 01:38:00.804
[Gregoire translates to french...]

01:38:01.003 --> 01:38:05.123
Then only you will see that your Kundalini itself is reactive.

01:38:05.323 --> 01:38:14.363
[Gregoire translates to french...]

01:38:14.564 --> 01:38:17.804
And the Kundalini of others also will react to it.

01:38:18.003 --> 01:38:21.764
[Gregoire translates to french...]

01:38:21.963 --> 01:38:26.404
So what is the end of it now, let's have one more? End of it.

01:38:26.604 --> 01:38:31.524
The last one, we can sing all together. All right, on the...

01:38:31.724 --> 01:38:33.923
[...]

01:38:41.484 --> 01:38:43.323
You see, the praise of god and

01:38:43.484 --> 01:38:46.604
when you are praising the god you have to use all the instrument.

01:38:46.804 --> 01:38:49.163
You have to use all styles,

01:38:49.363 --> 01:38:54.323
but keeping to the mariadas that you are praising god.

01:38:56.203 --> 01:39:00.323
It's a very nice bhairavi rag [...] the ending of,

01:39:00.524 --> 01:39:03.043
it's a very good song also. But now my throat is out,

01:39:03.203 --> 01:39:05.524
but that you should make.

01:39:16.163 --> 01:39:19.604
Sahaja Yogis are singing "Jai Jagadambe".

01:47:04.123 --> 01:47:10.323
That joy, that joy, innocent complete.

01:47:12.764 --> 01:47:13.844
May God bless you.

01:47:14.003 --> 01:47:16.963
I hope already you have reached the Nirvikalpa state.

01:47:20.923 --> 01:47:21.764
May God bless you.

01:47:21.963 --> 01:47:25.844
Tomorrow again we'll meet you here, it's quite late, doesn't matter.

01:47:26.003 --> 01:47:30.003
We'll  meet about 10 o'clock for our Puja.

01:47:30.203 --> 01:47:35.243
It will be, about 10:30 I will be here, the we'll have the Puja.

01:47:35.444 --> 01:47:39.844
For a great Sahasrara day, all right. May God bless you.

01:47:41.724 --> 01:47:44.003
[Guido asks] We just sing your own 3 Mantras.

01:47:44.323 --> 01:47:46.363
All right.

01:51:08.003 --> 01:51:09.203
[Saharara Mantras]

01:51:09.604 --> 01:51:16.764
May God bless you all. May God bless you all. May God bless you all.

01:51:21.844 --> 01:51:23.764
Take a bandhan.

01:51:40.469 --> 01:51:47.716
Tie up your Kundalini, put attention to your Saharara and sleep off.
