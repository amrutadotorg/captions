1
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:11,550
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

2
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:22,359
So much has been said and really my heart
is full of gratitude for all of you to come

3
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:33,420
here, all the way, and the way people have
described about Sahaja Yoga.

4
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:41,290
To understand Sahaja Yoga, we should know
where are we today in this Kali Yuga.

5
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:43,940
What are we facing today?

6
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:51,510
It should really make you feel quite disturbed
to see the way things are going on in every

7
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,030
country, everywhere.

8
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,990
What's the problem?

9
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:08,050
What is the, such a need for people to become
so restless, full of tensions.

10
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:15,680
Collectively, country-wise, anywhere you go
you find some sort of a confusion.

11
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,250
Terrible.

12
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:29,150
The whole society seems to be boiling with
a kind of a fear of destruction.

13
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,340
What is the reason?

14
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:36,310
There are so many religions, so many organized,
disorganized, all kinds of things.

15
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:40,180
There are so many sadhus and saints.

16
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:46,250
There are so many books written about what
you should have.

17
00:01:46,250 --> 00:02:00,680
But the only one who is a seeker of truth
should see one point: Why, why there is so

18
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,990
much problem in this world and how can you
help them?

19
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,729
Where is the problem?

20
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,900
It is inside the human being.

21
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:19,700
As described, you see, we have come out of
a animal stage to a human stage.

22
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,340
We have a human awareness, no doubt.

23
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:32,940
In that awareness, we start seeing all kinds
of things that are not good, which are destructive,

24
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,900
which are disturbing.

25
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,480
If it doesn't disturb you, that means you
are not at all a sensitive person.

26
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,840
But you are sensitive as a human being.

27
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,830
So now what is the reason for this, is there.

28
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:53,950
In every field of life, whether it is political,
economic or any field of life in which human

29
00:02:53,950 --> 00:03:04,700
beings are living, there's a very subtle problem
which people don't understand.

30
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:13,209
Now if I say that, "There is spirit within
us which shines in our heart," you need not

31
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:15,590
believe, need not believe.

32
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:20,270
But our attention is not on the spirit.

33
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:29,020
They call it "atma vimukh" - our attention
is outside.

34
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:38,010
At this stage at the human awareness, our
attention is outside, outside in various things.

35
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,950
Now where should our attention go?

36
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:44,410
To evolve, for what?

37
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,850
To achieve what?

38
00:03:46,850 --> 00:04:02,010
The firstly, our attention has now go towards
our spirit, towards spiritual understanding.

39
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:06,940
This is one thing has to happen to human beings
to begin with.

40
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,120
Otherwise our attention is outside.

41
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,930
We are worried about money, worried about
power, worried about this, worried about that,

42
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:18,549
in competition and all kinds of things going
on.

43
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:29,060
But if your attention is turned somehow towards
your spirit then what happens to you is that

44
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:36,910
you become a power of the spirit.

45
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:44,250
And the power of the spirit is the highest
power that you could think of.

46
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:51,470
First of all, spirit is the one that loves.

47
00:04:51,470 --> 00:05:00,410
Loves without asking for anything, without
expecting anything, just loves.

48
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:07,840
It's an unconditional type of a personality
which just emits love.

49
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:14,310
Anybody in trouble, anybody having a problem,
just it flows.

50
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:22,280
This capacity to flow in the heart exists
but on top of that, is the closing point,

51
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:27,190
is that our attention is not on our spirit.

52
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:34,449
Even in political endeavors or your economic
endeavors, any endeavor, what happens is that

53
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:37,530
attention is outside.

54
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:46,440
So you go into competition, you go into this
thing, you go on becoming very competent and

55
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,100
then suddenly you find another one coming
up.

56
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:55,990
There are so many struggles when your attention
is outside.

57
00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:01,110
Because in attention outside, there is no
purity.

58
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,990
There is no purity.

59
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:10,050
It's just attention to yourself and that too
is so limited.

60
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:19,490
Very limited it is because if you pay attention
to yourself, there's no end to your troubles

61
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:21,110
and woes.

62
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:26,700
For a person, as they said, really is fact
that: I don't mind sleeping anywhere.

63
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,710
I don't mind eating anything.

64
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:32,320
I am not bothered about all these things,
is a fact.

65
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:37,710
Because, you see, it's not very important
I think.

66
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,729
But without thinking, I am made like that.

67
00:06:39,729 --> 00:06:41,550
I am like that, all right.

68
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,310
But Sahaja yogis have become like this.

69
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:52,680
This is the miracle that human beings have
turned their attention to their spirit.

70
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,669
Then you are amazed how things work out.

71
00:06:57,669 --> 00:07:07,960
Without any competition, without any fights,
without any quarrels, how your attention becomes

72
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,910
fixed on your spirit.

73
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:15,410
First, the first thing that happens to you
is good health.

74
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:18,530
Your health improves.

75
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:24,639
Firstly, if your health is all right, I mean
so many problems are solved.

76
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,650
This world, I think at least 30% people are
always sick.

77
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:35,449
Because of the tensions, maybe because of
bad food and this and that.

78
00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:40,160
This is first thing that happens to you is
your health improves.

79
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:47,770
Today now in Sahaja Yoga, we have people who
have learned that by these modern ways of

80
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:52,770
economics and all that, has not given any
peace to anyone.

81
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:58,500
We think of America; I mean I've been to America,
I know Americans: How terribly disturbed they

82
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,500
are.

83
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,500
Their families are ruined.

84
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,500
Their children are ruined.

85
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,220
And all kinds of stupid things are happening.

86
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:09,270
Our Indian gurus are going and making a big
money there.

87
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,940
And they just want peace.

88
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:14,210
They just want peace of the heart.

89
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:20,130
That's only possible when your attention goes
to your heart because in the heart resides

90
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:25,250
the spirit and the spirit is the source of
peace.

91
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:33,889
First is the love and second as I told you
just now is the peace.

92
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:36,819
You become extremely peaceful.

93
00:08:36,819 --> 00:08:41,949
You become like a witness and you see the
whole drama like a joke.

94
00:08:41,949 --> 00:08:45,920
It's nothing so serious to be worried about.

95
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,569
It all works out.

96
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:56,280
And this is what one has to become is to become
the spirit which is your own, which is in

97
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:04,950
your own heart and that is the source, as
I told you, of love and again I say of peace.

98
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:16,100
And the third thing that happens to you, that
the source of spirit being joy, that joy bubbles

99
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,019
in your life.

100
00:09:18,019 --> 00:09:19,290
It just bubbles in your life.

101
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:27,420
You don't know how to get out of that great
ocean of joy.

102
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:31,880
You start swimming in it, enjoying it, every
bit of it.

103
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:38,249
You touch all the shores, going round the
whole world, their hearts and everything.

104
00:09:38,249 --> 00:09:40,850
It is in the heart that resides.

105
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:45,019
Again I say, it is not in the brain.

106
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:49,720
No mental activity can take you to spirit.

107
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:55,529
Spirit is only possible if your attention
could be somehow taken to the spirit.

108
00:09:55,529 --> 00:10:00,220
And that's possible only through Kundalini
awakening.

109
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:08,850
This change of attitude towards life, this
change of complete peace and joy has come

110
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:15,220
to you all because your attention is now on
your spirit.

111
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:19,239
Now you don't think of money, money walks
your way.

112
00:10:19,239 --> 00:10:22,600
You don't think of power, power walks your
way.

113
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:33,529
And the power of the spirit is the highest,
the most powerful and the most righteous thing.

114
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:42,110
It is not necessary that you should become
a sanyasi, sadhu baba, do all kinds of things.

115
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:44,730
No necessity of these rituals.

116
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:47,470
The spirit is residing within you.

117
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:49,410
Already all you have done in last lives.

118
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:55,220
Now this life only thing you have to do is
to put attention to your spirit.

119
00:10:55,220 --> 00:11:01,190
And that's only possible through the awakening
of this Kundalini - the Primordial Mother.

120
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:05,980
When She starts, I mean that's also your own.

121
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:15,610
When She starts rising, She passes through
the centers and enriches them, integrates

122
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:23,579
them, and pierces through the last fontanel
bone area and makes you connected to this

123
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:27,259
all pervading power of divine love.

124
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:34,610
But this power of divine love is not only
"the love," if you want to say, it is also

125
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:44,699
peace and joy and also it is the superior
wisdom.

126
00:11:44,699 --> 00:11:47,579
It is rather subtle for normal man to understand.

127
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:48,579
I know that.

128
00:11:48,579 --> 00:11:49,970
I've gone through that.

129
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:57,799
For persons to understand that one can become
the spirit .. but this is in the evolutionary

130
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:58,799
process.

131
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:02,739
Today is the time for people to become the
spirit.

132
00:12:02,739 --> 00:12:09,589
This is the blessing of this blossom time
as I call it and people have to become the

133
00:12:09,589 --> 00:12:10,920
spirit.

134
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:16,670
Otherwise what is left of them is like all
other human beings who'll, I don't where they'll

135
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:17,839
end up.

136
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:23,170
So this is an essential step today to become
the spirit.

137
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:29,049
All the saints, all the prophets, all the
religions have talked about it.

138
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:30,230
Not that they have not.

139
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:32,139
Of course, we have twisted them.

140
00:12:32,139 --> 00:12:35,239
We have made separate, separate things.

141
00:12:35,239 --> 00:12:46,429
But it's only one simple thing is that you
are a spirit and that spirit, unless and until

142
00:12:46,429 --> 00:12:56,149
you become, you cannot achieve any peace,
any joy and no love.

143
00:12:56,149 --> 00:13:04,459
The Sahaja yogis here are sitting have achieved
it.

144
00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:11,240
They don't think they are from foreign countries
or from this country or that country.

145
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,240
They don't want.

146
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:18,410
Now here it is in this camp we don't have
very good arrangement for sleeping or eating

147
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:21,069
or anything, no good bathrooms, nothing.

148
00:13:21,069 --> 00:13:24,519
They are just enjoying themselves.

149
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:25,519
Nobody minds it.

150
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,699
Of course certain things of particular country
may linger on.

151
00:13:29,699 --> 00:13:33,589
But then it drops, it drops.

152
00:13:33,589 --> 00:13:37,480
Gradually it starts dropping out.

153
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,440
Like a flower when it becomes the fruit.

154
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:46,120
All its petals and everything drops out and
then it becomes the fruit.

155
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:54,449
So you have now become the fruit -fruit of
knowledge, fruit of wisdom and of love.

156
00:13:54,449 --> 00:13:58,459
For knowledge, you don't have to read books.

157
00:13:58,459 --> 00:13:59,649
There's no need to.

158
00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:03,540
People who have read too many are difficult
to get Sahaja Yoga.

159
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:11,279
But what you have to see yourself: What is
the reality?

160
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:16,639
But that's only possible if you are a realized
soul.

161
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,399
Otherwise you get lost in the illusions of
the world.

162
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,919
You live with the illusions all your life,
struggling, fighting and I don't want to say

163
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:27,149
what's the end is.

164
00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:33,449
So a simple thing that has happened with Sahaja
Yoga, in your evolutionary process your attention

165
00:14:33,449 --> 00:14:38,899
now has gone to spirit than to anything else.

166
00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:46,119
As soon as the power of the spirit comes,
you find yourself successful in everything.

167
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:47,730
You don't want;.

168
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:53,799
You don't ask for it and if you are not, you
don't mind.

169
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:56,179
You don't mind because you think they don't
understand.

170
00:14:56,179 --> 00:14:58,759
It's all right, forget it.

171
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:02,630
So there's no use fighting for it, asking
for it.

172
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:11,609
For this, one thing is important, first and
foremost thing, you have to forgive everyone.

173
00:15:11,609 --> 00:15:16,480
Human beings, I don't know sometimes they're
illogical.

174
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,880
Supposing somebody tries to harm you.

175
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,149
All right, I forgive him.

176
00:15:21,149 --> 00:15:24,559
Forget it because I have no headache of that.

177
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:28,689
What he is trying to do is to give me a headache
which I will not take.

178
00:15:28,689 --> 00:15:30,559
I just forgive.

179
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:35,799
So that is a very important point, that Christ
has also said that, "You have to forgive."

180
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:41,149
Mohammad Sahib has said so many things but
I don't know how people have twisted.

181
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:45,519
Christ has said so many things, how I don't
know how they are being twisted.

182
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:52,299
Every one of them has said one thing: that
you have to become the Spirit.

183
00:15:52,299 --> 00:15:58,720
And how people have twisted it and have formed
so many religions and in that religion why

184
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,049
should they quarrel?

185
00:16:00,049 --> 00:16:03,779
If there is one God there should be no quarrel.

186
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:08,579
Now in Sahaja yoga, you find people have come
from different race, different countries,

187
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:11,399
different ideologies, everything.

188
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:14,540
One thing great about Sahaja yogis, they are
very pure people.

189
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,339
There's so much of purity in them.

190
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:18,339
There's no problem.

191
00:16:18,339 --> 00:16:25,850
I do not have that problem of immorality in
Sahaja Yoga.

192
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:28,519
We don't find anybody being immoral.

193
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:32,759
If somebody has been immoral, he just gets
corrected.

194
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:37,189
If somebody has been cheating, he gets corrected.

195
00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:43,229
If somebody has been a corrupt person, he
gets corrected.

196
00:16:43,229 --> 00:16:50,809
Because spirit gives the light for you to
see for yourself what is good for you.

197
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:54,600
Supposing you are going on a road and you
are blind.

198
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,149
You can walk into a ditch.

199
00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:00,749
But supposing you have the light and the eyes
open.

200
00:17:00,749 --> 00:17:02,489
You know how to go.

201
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:08,750
And that's exactly what has happened in Sahaja
Yoga, that people have realized how to move,

202
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:15,270
how to go about, how to walk, and not to fall
in the ditch.

203
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:19,209
I have seen people who have fallen into ditch
also.

204
00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:21,500
But I have nothing but love for them.

205
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:26,770
Because they were blind, you see, for a blind
person you can just have love, isn't it?

206
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:33,700
And I found that once I forgive them completely
and I ask them, all right, even if they have

207
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:37,649
abused Me, said things against Me, it's all
right.

208
00:17:37,649 --> 00:17:39,639
Because they don't know what they are doing.

209
00:17:39,639 --> 00:17:41,799
They are blind people.

210
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:48,039
So once you feel that way about others, that
doesn't matter.

211
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:55,289
Whatever they have done, whatever they have
so far, so called harmed you also, is no harm

212
00:17:55,289 --> 00:18:01,539
to you because you are standing on a pedestal
of truth.

213
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:08,809
So the second point is that the spirit is
the source of truth, not of untruth.

214
00:18:08,809 --> 00:18:12,809
For example, there is some false guru.

215
00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:14,950
Immediately you will know who is false.

216
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:15,950
How?

217
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:21,840
On your vibrations, on your fingertips you
know that this man is false.

218
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:27,970
Is all said by Mohammad Sahib that, "Your
hands will speak at the time of resurrection."

219
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:32,279
That exactly happens that you see: this is
the trouble.

220
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:39,059
Now if you want you can avoid that person
or if you want you can bring him round and

221
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:40,240
put him right.

222
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:48,350
But we should not try on the complicated characters
very much in the beginning, I said, because

223
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:50,169
they will complicate you.

224
00:18:50,169 --> 00:18:57,039
Now those people who have matured in Sahaja
Yoga can easily manage that also.

225
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:02,130
And also we must know that all the elements
are working for us.

226
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:09,549
All the events of the world are just to show
how wrong things are wrong and how right things

227
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:10,740
should be done.

228
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,009
Say for example, when Hitler came.

229
00:19:14,009 --> 00:19:15,909
He started destroying people.

230
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:18,870
And he took nine years to build himself up.

231
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:24,820
And he did all kinds of things which cannot
be forgiven by anyone.

232
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:31,419
But he died and suddenly you find in Germany,
people are so enlightened.

233
00:19:31,419 --> 00:19:39,990
Now you heard some people, I was amazed how
they are so enlightened about love and about

234
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,690
the divine.

235
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:48,160
All these countries, I've seen are doing so
well unexpectedly.

236
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:54,169
Imagine in England, who came to India and
ruled us for three hundred years, there are

237
00:19:54,169 --> 00:19:56,270
so many Sahaja yogis.

238
00:19:56,270 --> 00:20:04,720
And also as you see today when I speak there,
we have the whole hall filled up with people,

239
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,720
in England.

240
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:14,580
I've seen also in the countries like Russia,
where these people were on the verge of collapsing

241
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,789
after they started on democracy.

242
00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:24,299
Whether it is democracy or communism or anything,
these are all isms.

243
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:30,750
You have to come out of it and see for yourself
that so called democracy has become demon-ocracy.

244
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:35,029
So called communism has failed.

245
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:36,029
Why?

246
00:20:36,029 --> 00:20:37,799
Basically what's wrong with them?

247
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:42,669
It was all based not on the spiritual level.

248
00:20:42,669 --> 00:20:44,960
There was no spirit involved in it.

249
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:56,950
It was all based on, I should say, on the
endeavors which are outside, which were very

250
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,110
limited.

251
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:02,129
And those limits, once they break, you see
you have a problem.

252
00:21:02,129 --> 00:21:06,260
Now economics, the world economics if you
see is collapsing.

253
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,559
Everywhere there is recession.

254
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:13,210
If they are such experts then why there is
recession?

255
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:14,870
Why there are problems?

256
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:17,630
Now the people say we must remove the poverty.

257
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:27,370
I agree but not by giving some sort of a beggar's
gift but with self respect.

258
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:31,840
You can do it.

259
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:42,610
You can do it because if you can approach
people who need with Sahaja Yoga and enrich

260
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:48,789
them, you'll be amazed, they themselves will
do better and work it out.

261
00:21:48,789 --> 00:21:54,820
All kinds of things, you see, like in abroad
people used to say, "Mother, You talk of spiritual

262
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:57,220
life then why is it India is so poor?"

263
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:01,330
I said, "They are not so poor in spirituality."

264
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:04,769
They may be poor in money.

265
00:22:04,769 --> 00:22:10,059
Those who have got lots of money, are they
also very good people?

266
00:22:10,059 --> 00:22:13,059
Are they also doing something very good?

267
00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:18,009
In the same way, those who are poor are not
doing something good that one should have

268
00:22:18,009 --> 00:22:19,130
compassion on them.

269
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,130
Agreed.

270
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,309
Now what to do?

271
00:22:22,309 --> 00:22:25,399
If both sides are so miserable, what should
we do?

272
00:22:25,399 --> 00:22:26,879
Is to change them.

273
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:31,559
Change the whole attitude towards life.

274
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:37,970
Immediately I've seen people who are supposed
to be rich start understanding poverty.

275
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:41,480
They start sharing.

276
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,930
They start working it out.

277
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:49,900
In Sahaja Yoga, you'll be amazed how people
help each other.

278
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:58,700
How they work out everybody's difficulties
and problems into something very beautiful.

279
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:03,690
You see, it's the wisdom that you get from
this all pervading divine power.

280
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:07,320
This power has been described in every religion.

281
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:13,450
You call it nirakar, you call it ruuh, you
can call it paramchaitanya; you can call by

282
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:14,870
any name.

283
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:17,080
But name is not the point.

284
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:21,669
Whatever it is, once you are connected with
this power, you are blessed.

285
00:23:21,669 --> 00:23:26,460
Thousand times you are blessed than you are
as a normal human being.

286
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:30,680
As a normal being, no blessings it has.

287
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:36,049
It has nothing but your own endeavors that
the amount you push in, that's what you get.

288
00:23:36,049 --> 00:23:41,200
Here nobody pushes oneself.

289
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,990
Automatically you are pushed into that.

290
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:47,580
This force, divine force brings you to that.

291
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:52,460
And you have seen that in your own lives how
you came to Me, how you came to Sahaja Yoga.

292
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:59,909
It was some sort of a divine force which worked
it out, which is Sahaja, which you may not

293
00:23:59,909 --> 00:24:05,123
realize but when you get your realization,
you just think about your own life: "How I

294
00:24:05,123 --> 00:24:08,809
came to Sahaja Yoga?

295
00:24:08,809 --> 00:24:10,720
How I got this?"

296
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,070
And then you see this peace, reigning over
your hearts.

297
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:18,570
The love, affection, everything.

298
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:25,700
What is, as you said, I have many powers,
maybe I don't know, but one thing for definite,

299
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:36,720
one thing that Sahaja yogis can get all My
powers.

300
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:47,130
As a Mother, Mother wants to give everything
to Sahaja yogis.

301
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:58,510
This greatest joy for a Mother is to see Her
son or daughter grow up like Her.

302
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:04,659
I, I have a great vision of life.

303
00:25:04,659 --> 00:25:10,059
And I see the picture of that here today.

304
00:25:10,059 --> 00:25:14,940
I was a ordinary housewife without much money.

305
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,820
You know My interest in money is zero.

306
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:22,299
I don't understand even the bank and the somebody
has to sign a cheque for Me.

307
00:25:22,299 --> 00:25:25,860
My husband has to count My money, I am so
bad.

308
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,480
But still I've never had problem.

309
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:38,419
Never had problem because it is the greed
in man, terrible greed in man that creates

310
00:25:38,419 --> 00:25:39,529
problems.

311
00:25:39,529 --> 00:25:47,570
But if he learns how to be satisfied, automatically
the greed drops out and you feel absolutely

312
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:48,570
comfortable.

313
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:53,970
But that doesn't mean that you become a sadhu
baba or you become a sanyasi or a something

314
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:55,320
you give up.

315
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,070
Those days are gone.

316
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:59,641
Those ordeals you have passed through.

317
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:00,641
You've been to the Himalayas.

318
00:26:00,641 --> 00:26:03,419
You've stood on your heads and did all kinds
of things.

319
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:05,470
Now no more is needed.

320
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:12,090
What is needed is that: you have to put your
attention to your spirit, the more you do

321
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:21,759
it, the more you absorb all other attentions
and put it to your spirit, which is there

322
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:23,450
already existing.

323
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:28,480
There is nothing to be brought from outside
or nothing to be learnt.

324
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,850
It is inside every one of you, is in the heart.

325
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:37,700
Only thing you have to, you have to just feel
it.

326
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:44,519
Now that feeling can only come if you are
awakened in the Kundalini.

327
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:58,299
I know that no one like Mohammad Sahib or
Christ or Abraham or Moses, who have created

328
00:26:58,299 --> 00:27:06,139
books or whatever history they have created,
no where They would have ever thought that

329
00:27:06,139 --> 00:27:14,960
people will form an organized religion and
start in a way as if they are against each

330
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,960
other.

331
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,350
But it has happened.

332
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,399
It has happened.

333
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:27,139
To remove that, you have to give them the
knowledge, the pure knowledge.

334
00:27:27,139 --> 00:27:30,240
Not the knowledge of the book but the pure
knowledge.

335
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,240
And the knowledge that is pure is wisdom.

336
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,499
Through this wisdom only I've worked.

337
00:27:38,499 --> 00:27:41,190
This wisdom I had from My childhood.

338
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:42,279
Nobody has given Me.

339
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:43,279
It's there.

340
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:50,159
But this wisdom has taught Me one thing: that
whatsoever maybe the condition of a human

341
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:59,250
being, whatsoever maybe his style, whatsoever
may be his ego or his conditioning if he can

342
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:05,929
feel the love then his spirit gets [transformed?].

343
00:28:05,929 --> 00:28:08,960
This transformation has taken place.

344
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:15,330
Here we have only one percent of the people
who have got realization all over the world.

345
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:23,960
But I know, I remember them all today who
are not here, that they have been seekers,

346
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,769
madly seeking, seeking the truth.

347
00:28:28,769 --> 00:28:32,379
They went through horrible time seeking.

348
00:28:32,379 --> 00:28:33,679
They had very bad gurus.

349
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,460
They had all kinds of expenses, everything
they did.

350
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:42,759
But once they came to Sahaja Yoga, they have
found what was the truth is.

351
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:47,559
And the truth is very simple: that you are
the spirit.

352
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:54,049
You are not this body, this mind, but you
are the spirit.

353
00:28:54,049 --> 00:28:57,940
This is the truth and they have found the
spirit.

354
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:01,590
That's what is the truth that they have found.

355
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:09,629
Once this truth is established within you,
that you are the spirit, nothing can destroy

356
00:29:09,629 --> 00:29:13,450
you, nothing can harm you.

357
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:16,220
It cannot have any wants.

358
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,220
It doesn't have.

359
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:22,179
What wants can you have when you have the
spirit because such a satisfying thing?

360
00:29:22,179 --> 00:29:26,029
It doesn't condemn anyone.

361
00:29:26,029 --> 00:29:29,499
It doesn't runs after anyone.

362
00:29:29,499 --> 00:29:34,139
Is satisfied with itself, absolutely satisfied.

363
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:39,799
You see, I was very anxious that I should
lead a very normal life.

364
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:45,889
I should not be like some Himalaya fellow
or something like that.

365
00:29:45,889 --> 00:29:50,149
Because this is needed for a common people.

366
00:29:50,149 --> 00:29:56,700
Today it's a aim en mass, en mass awakening.

367
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,759
It is not for one person.

368
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:05,679
This was the thing because once any discovery
is made, supposing, and that discovery only

369
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,399
is for one individual, it has no meaning.

370
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,330
It has to go to masses.

371
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:14,710
And this is what I knew: I have to do it.

372
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:19,919
And I had to work - they say so but I don't
think I ever worked.

373
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,249
I was just witness to whole thing.

374
00:30:22,249 --> 00:30:29,720
I saw it just like a witness enjoying all
kinds of things as you sit on the shore of

375
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,720
a ocean.

376
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,090
You see waves coming, going like that.

377
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:45,150
But inside, inside that is a human being who
wants to evolve, who wants to become the spirit.

378
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:48,950
Then he starts thinking what good he can do
to others.

379
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:55,340
So far I've been very anxious that people
should become Sahaja yogis.

380
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:59,659
I didn't take to any missionary work or any
social work.

381
00:30:59,659 --> 00:31:04,580
I used to do when I was not in Sahaja Yoga,
I should say, when I didn't start the Sahaja

382
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,580
Yoga.

383
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:14,639
But later on, I discovered that unless and
until you transform people, unless and until

384
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:19,700
you become the spirit, you'll become like
any other social worker.

385
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,399
I was working in a, say, blind school.

386
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:27,440
I was the chairman of the blind school, blind
people.

387
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:33,970
And I was surprised, the people who were with
Me were very funny type you know?

388
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:39,070
The governor was to come and they said, "Who
will sit next to governor?"

389
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:41,159
I said, "What is this?"

390
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:45,249
So they said also, "I being the president,
I have to sit."

391
00:31:45,249 --> 00:31:46,639
I said, "Not necessary.

392
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:48,220
I can sit anywhere."

393
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:51,159
But they all started quarreling on this point.

394
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:59,100
So I said, "All right, we'll take a plank
and put it on head of the - of the governor

395
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:02,909
and you all sit on that like sparrows."

396
00:32:02,909 --> 00:32:05,999
That humor helped a lot and they settled down.

397
00:32:05,999 --> 00:32:12,200
So this is the stupid thing where you see
it, what is your position, what do you get?

398
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:19,509
I mean it's so stupid that even the ant knows
how to work out the collectivity.

399
00:32:19,509 --> 00:32:26,259
I don't know how human beings are dying after
useless nonsensical things.

400
00:32:26,259 --> 00:32:30,869
But the only thing is, he has not yet become
the spirit.

401
00:32:30,869 --> 00:32:34,929
So he doesn't respect himself, no respect.

402
00:32:34,929 --> 00:32:40,840
So he does all these things which are not
very respectable I think.

403
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:47,600
Then I thought that this kind of work people
are doing, they think no end of themselves.

404
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:54,480
Once you start doing something good, why should
you think you are very great?

405
00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:00,129
I, I can't understand, you see, My brain is
that way useless.

406
00:33:00,129 --> 00:33:05,380
Because what I found with these people who
were working with Me, very anxious to take

407
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,350
the credit for this.

408
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:09,960
Somebody wanted to become the chairman, vice-chairman.

409
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,489
I said, "You become everything."

410
00:33:12,489 --> 00:33:19,940
So the attention being on your promotion,
it's not a real promotion, no promotion.

411
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:25,739
Everybody used to laugh at them, it's a degradation.

412
00:33:25,739 --> 00:33:35,330
Your promotion is not through your own being
but through your own spirit.

413
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:42,380
Being means a very big thing, I think, but
spirit is very subtle, very beautiful which

414
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,690
is residing in all of you like a light.

415
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:47,720
It's a light in you.

416
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:52,220
Now there are Sahaja, so many Sahaja yogis
who are giving enlightenment to others.

417
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:55,020
There are people who are going all over the
world.

418
00:33:55,020 --> 00:34:05,080
I was surprised that people from Germany and
Austria came to help Me when I first went

419
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,080
to Russia.

420
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,770
I said, "What are you doing here?"

421
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:15,470
Said, "Mother we have to do something because
so many people were killed by our forefathers."

422
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:20,500
Then My heart started really thanking them.

423
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,869
Look at this, what has come into them?

424
00:34:23,869 --> 00:34:30,490
Then they went, you'll be amazed, to Israel
and from Israel they brought lots of Sahaja

425
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:31,810
yogis to Egypt.

426
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:35,859
So I asked the Israelis, Sahaja yogis, "Why
are you here?"

427
00:34:35,859 --> 00:34:44,379
They said, "Mother it's our job now to make
friends with these Sahaja yogis from Egypt."

428
00:34:44,379 --> 00:34:53,190
Just see how love engulfs all these angularities,
all these thorns of life and dissolves it

429
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:55,319
completely.

430
00:34:55,319 --> 00:35:02,400
It's so joy giving to see your love acting
on others.

431
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:08,480
Small, small things and very big things, all
that works out with love.

432
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:18,270
For example, in an industry now people have
problems of strikes.

433
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:29,520
Very common struggle, haves and have not and
this going on.

434
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:36,299
But if you can raise the people to the spiritual
height, to their spiritual need which is the

435
00:35:36,299 --> 00:35:45,230
most important need today, you'll be amazed
there will be no problem of any kind.

436
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:49,329
You see, it is a kind of a communism.

437
00:35:49,329 --> 00:35:51,559
It's a kind of a socialism.

438
00:35:51,559 --> 00:35:53,810
It's a kind of a democracy.

439
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:58,690
It's all things put together which works.

440
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:06,369
Democracy means we have Sahaja yogis who wanted
to organize this.

441
00:36:06,369 --> 00:36:09,080
They said, "Mother what should we do?"

442
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,680
I said, "I am not going to say anything.

443
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,579
You do what you like.

444
00:36:12,579 --> 00:36:17,150
You choose whatever you like, whatever you
want to do."

445
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:21,809
And I was just busy arranging the flowers
in the house because so many flowers came

446
00:36:21,809 --> 00:36:23,109
and I am worried about the flowers.

447
00:36:23,109 --> 00:36:26,069
I was just arranging the flowers in the house.

448
00:36:26,069 --> 00:36:34,980
And what I find, now see how they've done:
no quarrel, no fight, no discussion, nothing.

449
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:37,960
How have they done?

450
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:41,820
Otherwise you cannot make ten people sit together
and talk the same way.

451
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:45,869
One will talk, another will talk, another
will talk, will go on discussing, discussing

452
00:36:45,869 --> 00:36:49,349
this, reaching nowhere.

453
00:36:49,349 --> 00:36:53,250
Otherwise only one man has to work it out,
otherwise nothing can work.

454
00:36:53,250 --> 00:37:02,280
So you see, it changes the whole atmosphere
of every human being.

455
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:09,820
Changes his attitude, changes his endeavors
and everything becomes so beautiful and joy

456
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:14,490
giving.

457
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:21,190
You are a socialist also because you start
thinking about the people who are down trodden,

458
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:30,099
people who have no money who are poor, and
you try to work out something by which they

459
00:37:30,099 --> 00:37:31,809
get some money.

460
00:37:31,809 --> 00:37:38,550
I used to go with My father for a case in
a district called Chanda.

461
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:43,130
And there I saw people just with one cloth
around them.

462
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:50,220
What was shocking to Me: just one cloth, whether
it is winter or summer.

463
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:56,200
I used to weep so My father would say, "Why
to weep before them?"

464
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,780
I said, "What can I do?

465
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:00,560
I must try to do something for them."

466
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:09,410
Now when I got so many Sahaja yogis, I told
them, "I want to help these people somehow.

467
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:13,650
And what they make is pottery."

468
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:15,270
So they said, "Mother, all right.

469
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:16,630
You can get the pottery.

470
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:20,210
We'll import here and we'll sell them."

471
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:26,520
You'll be amazed now, these people have got
houses, they have got a good life to live

472
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,250
and they are living very well.

473
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:32,730
So in a way, it is a kind of a socialism.

474
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:40,770
That you see problems and you know collectively
to solve it, collectively, not singularly

475
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:41,770
but collectively.

476
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:46,470
The all of the Sahaja yogis suggest, "Mother,
this can be solved."

477
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:54,100
So far I have not done anything directly,
I must say, like starting a organization of

478
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,230
that kind.

479
00:38:55,230 --> 00:39:01,170
But now when there are so many Sahaja yogis
with their attention on their heart, now My

480
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:06,200
attention is going to the people who need
our help.

481
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:13,530
So first time, I have asked them to make an
NGO for destitute women and for children who

482
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:16,850
are being deserted by their parents.

483
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:20,349
And immediately, you'll be amazed, it all
did.

484
00:39:20,349 --> 00:39:21,349
We got the land.

485
00:39:21,349 --> 00:39:22,349
We got the people.

486
00:39:22,349 --> 00:39:26,280
I mean, I'm not doing anything and it's all
done.

487
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:31,020
Moreover, so many people have written, "Mother
if You want land, we can give You.

488
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,490
You come here, do this, do that."

489
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:35,060
Can you imagine?

490
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:40,040
Once I just thought of it: that we have to
do something for the poor people.

491
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:48,150
Also other so many things can be done with
your attention which is pure, full of love

492
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:55,500
because the love, you see, is something that
gives you the wisdom how to do it.

493
00:39:55,500 --> 00:40:03,720
If you have love, it gives you the complete
insight into the problems and how it works.

494
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:14,180
See it's surprising for Me, I mean, I used
to do that always but even after Sahaja Yoga

495
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:18,280
I found that is the love is the solution.

496
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:24,549
Is this only way we can enter into the hearts
of people.

497
00:40:24,549 --> 00:40:30,859
But for that love, we should not try to do
it for some money or for some achievements

498
00:40:30,859 --> 00:40:40,430
or for some sort of a reward, but just the
whim of the love and that is what is today

499
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:45,660
paying all of you: The way you love all the
people.

500
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,121
The way you have done so much work.

501
00:40:47,121 --> 00:40:51,780
You don't know what gratitude I have for you.

502
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,940
Single-handed I could not have done it.

503
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:56,470
I could not have gone to so many countries.

504
00:40:56,470 --> 00:41:02,040
It's a like a place like Benin, where there
are only Muslims are there, I would never

505
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:07,700
- I could never have thought of going to that
far fetched place where these people are there

506
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:12,800
and imagine these people are Muslims and they
have all taken to Sahaja Yoga.

507
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,890
And in that they are understanding the beauty
of love.

508
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:20,349
You, this is done by French.

509
00:41:20,349 --> 00:41:23,890
Can you believe these French?

510
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:29,040
Going down all the way to Benin and getting
it done.

511
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:40,490
Even English have gone all the way to different
countries; even the Austrians and also Germans

512
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:46,780
and Italians are another quality of people
who have a very rich heart, I must say.

513
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:52,910
They have a very rich heart and the way they
are spreading Sahaja Yoga throughout Italy

514
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:54,210
is really remarkable.

515
00:41:54,210 --> 00:42:03,250
I am amazed how these people are approaching
all these people who have never known what

516
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:08,359
is spirit is and how they are getting them
to Mother.

517
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:12,730
Now with that, you see, we don't have to say
"prohibition."

518
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:16,160
We don't have to say "don't take drugs," nothing.

519
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,950
No don'ts in Sahaja Yoga.

520
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:19,980
Automatically they drop.

521
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:22,770
I don't have to say, "Don't do it."

522
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:25,220
Just automatically they drop.

523
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:33,980
I mean you'll be amazed, once we had a program
and there was a light to be put in a one of

524
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:38,680
the deepas and nobody had a matchbox.

525
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,680
Can you imagine?

526
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,680
Nobody has a matchbox.

527
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:44,480
Is such a problem with thousands of people
there, nobody has matchbox.

528
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,270
So we had to send somebody to get the matchbox.

529
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:49,829
There's no need.

530
00:42:49,829 --> 00:42:52,789
So I never say, "Don't do this," never.

531
00:42:52,789 --> 00:42:58,069
I've never said it but it has worked like
that, it has worked.

532
00:42:58,069 --> 00:43:03,700
I don't know how, how you have dropped it
but it's very simple when the light of the

533
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,349
spirit is there.

534
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:09,630
In that light, you just don't.

535
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:14,020
Now all the people have said, "Don't drink."

536
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:21,319
Say for example: Sikhs, Muslims but you see
they all drink because they are not really

537
00:43:21,319 --> 00:43:23,970
Muslims, they are not really Sikhs.

538
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:26,520
If they were really that, they would not have
drunk.

539
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:30,559
How is it possible then?

540
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:32,390
They have to be the spirit.

541
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:37,910
In the light of the spirit, we just don't
do anything that is destructive, just don't

542
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:38,910
do it.

543
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:40,200
You don't have to tell anybody.

544
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:45,360
Now you are all sitting here, you know that
I've never told you anyone, "Don't do this."

545
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:51,220
But I was amazed in London that people overnight
gave up drugs, overnight.

546
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:56,299
People employ military, this, that drugs is
[INAUDIBLE].

547
00:43:56,299 --> 00:43:57,849
They gave up prostitution.

548
00:43:57,849 --> 00:44:04,160
They gave (up) drugs, all kinds of destructive
things to which human being take sometimes

549
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:10,290
out of frustration and sometimes because they
feel very lonely.

550
00:44:10,290 --> 00:44:14,440
But now in Sahaja Yoga, you can never be lonely.

551
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:18,280
All over the world, you have brothers and
sisters.

552
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:24,160
If they come to know somebody is there somebody
is coming, they'll all go to the airport to

553
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,160
receive.

554
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:30,840
It's not a brotherhood of a ordinary life.

555
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,859
It's a very deep type of a brotherhood.

556
00:44:32,859 --> 00:44:35,510
It's a very deep understanding.

557
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:40,039
But they are very deep people, I must say,
because they have been seekers and in that

558
00:44:40,039 --> 00:44:49,589
seeking they have really got completely into
a turmoil and that has made them very deep

559
00:44:49,589 --> 00:44:50,589
people.

560
00:44:50,589 --> 00:44:55,530
This book is "Light of Quran" is written by
a lady Gilmet.

561
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:56,530
You read it.

562
00:44:56,530 --> 00:44:59,600
I would request you to read it because she
is so deep.

563
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:06,799
I knew she was very deep but the way she has
expressed is so beautiful, so joy giving that

564
00:45:06,799 --> 00:45:12,670
she's not a Muslim, she married a Muslim,
so called, because they were all Sahaja yogis

565
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:18,140
and the way she has narrated her seeking is
so beautiful.

566
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:24,059
We have so many big writers in Sahaja Yoga
who have given very, very nice books and things.

567
00:45:24,059 --> 00:45:26,210
But this Gilmet is very shy.

568
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:27,210
She doesn't talk.

569
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:28,650
She keeps quiet.

570
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:32,670
But inside, she's so deep because of her seeking.

571
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:40,130
So there are many people in this world who
are seeking the truth because they cannot

572
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:47,789
bear the nonsense of modern world and they
are very sensitive.

573
00:45:47,789 --> 00:45:50,109
They are not insensitive, very sensitive people.

574
00:45:50,109 --> 00:45:54,030
That's how you all got your realization.

575
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:55,869
It's nothing of Mine.

576
00:45:55,869 --> 00:45:58,520
To say that "I did it," is not proper.

577
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:04,140
If you were not like a candle, I could not
have enlightened you.

578
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:06,099
So I am very thankful to you.

579
00:46:06,099 --> 00:46:13,299
And I am so much enamored by the way you people
are feeling about Sahaja Yoga: that collectively

580
00:46:13,299 --> 00:46:17,690
you have to work it out, globally you have
to work it out.

581
00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:21,290
You have to help each other and bring up the
people.

582
00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:29,410
Most important thing is to create a mind universally
which is towards the spirit.

583
00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:32,030
Then we'll solve all the problems, no problem.

584
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:38,230
Now if I say I am starting some sort of a
project here for the poor.

585
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:42,090
Immediately all of them will send Me money.

586
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:43,090
Immediately they'll all work.

587
00:46:43,090 --> 00:46:47,170
They'll find out who can work it out, who
can come and help Mother.

588
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:48,960
What work can we give them?

589
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,240
How to work it out, all over the world.

590
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,850
I mean, it spreads so fast.

591
00:46:54,850 --> 00:46:57,000
I have to just say that.

592
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,630
I never asked for money.

593
00:46:58,630 --> 00:47:04,290
I never said, "I need money," but immediately
they will plan out the whole thing, bring

594
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:06,770
the whole thing here and work it out.

595
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:09,869
It can work in India, it can work anywhere.

596
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:13,130
It's not just they are interested in India.

597
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:16,480
But globally they are interested in the problems.

598
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:24,029
It is not for making some sort of a show or
some sort of a, we can say, a cult.

599
00:47:24,029 --> 00:47:31,890
It is something which is very innate, which
is very subtle and that works, that gives

600
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:33,020
them joy.

601
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:36,520
That gives them joy to do something for Sahaja
Yoga.

602
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:47,599
I am sometimes amazed how they feel for the
whole world, how they care for the whole world,

603
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:49,170
how they are willing to do for [?].

604
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:52,940
Of course as I said, every country has some
problems.

605
00:47:52,940 --> 00:48:01,440
Like, we can say that north Indians are interested
always in politics because Delhi is here.

606
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,380
But is reduced now, very much reduced now.

607
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:06,230
There's not much going on.

608
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:09,190
And they don't like to hear anything against
anyone.

609
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:10,910
That's a good thing.

610
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:18,280
And in the south, we can say in the beyond
Narmada river, whatever we have, Maharashtra

611
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:22,720
and all that, they are very ritualistic, very
ritualistic people.

612
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:27,160
Even if they put the thali [thali MEANS PLATE
FOR DINING], you must put salt here, you must

613
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:33,220
put vegetable here, you .. so that a blind
man can also eat food properly.

614
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:35,160
You must use only one hand.

615
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,839
You must keep another hand tied up.

616
00:48:36,839 --> 00:48:42,310
They're very, very ritualistic because of
these two things, you see, in Sahaja Yoga

617
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:44,380
they do not grow.

618
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:51,349
Whatever it is, we have to understand that
these are [lingering PROBABLY ?] still are

619
00:48:51,349 --> 00:48:52,349
behind us.

620
00:48:52,349 --> 00:48:57,870
For example in north India, I would say if
anybody speaks anything ill about anybody,

621
00:48:57,870 --> 00:48:59,050
just put your.

622
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:02,000
This principle of Gandhiji was correct.

623
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,420
Never listen to any nonsensical gossip.

624
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:07,319
Gossip is going on.

625
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:11,230
People like to listen to gossip because of
this media also.

626
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:14,380
They were showing nothing but gossip before
election.

627
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:18,799
And the whole gossip goes into our mind and
that's how we work out.

628
00:49:18,799 --> 00:49:25,029
So for this part, I would request all the
people from the north India to never to listen

629
00:49:25,029 --> 00:49:29,300
any criticism, never to criticize anyone.

630
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,319
What is the use?

631
00:49:31,319 --> 00:49:37,210
Just see logically: if you listen to somebody's
criticism, what is the use?

632
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:39,890
What do you gain out of it?

633
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:45,510
Now by repeating it to somebody else, what
do you gain?

634
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:46,510
What is the gain?

635
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:52,190
Simple thing, always ask the question: What
is the gain?

636
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:55,880
And why to see something wrong with others?

637
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:58,880
I know by that you can be cheated.

638
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,339
Somebody can deceive you, is true.

639
00:50:02,339 --> 00:50:04,480
But doesn't matter.

640
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,880
You don't get anything into your head.

641
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:11,039
You don't get any filth and any poison in
your head.

642
00:50:11,039 --> 00:50:17,089
I know there are people who create problem,
talk from one to another, do this, do that.

643
00:50:17,089 --> 00:50:23,369
But that should not harm you in anyway because
you have the spirit and the spirit cannot

644
00:50:23,369 --> 00:50:24,369
be harmed.

645
00:50:24,369 --> 00:50:25,380
It cannot be destroyed.

646
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:29,650
It is said that, "It cannot be destroyed by
any weapon.

647
00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:32,319
It lives and lives forever."

648
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:40,380
So the attention towards the atma is lacking,
atma vimukta.

649
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:50,289
We, our eyes have gone, our attention is gone
to something away from the spirit and that's

650
00:50:50,289 --> 00:50:52,760
why all the problems are there.

651
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:59,960
Once you are one with your spirit, it works.

652
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:06,170
It works for you because it is in connection
with the God almighty.

653
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:13,990
It is in connection with the all pervading
power, which works out everything.

654
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:16,079
I know this all pervading power.

655
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:21,180
It has showing so many miraculous photographs
about Me.

656
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:25,260
And actually I, I didn't ask It but It is
doing.

657
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:27,390
Because very active, It is very active.

658
00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:32,829
And if It sees anybody who is subtle and who
is deep, It acts.

659
00:51:32,829 --> 00:51:39,700
In your business, in your politics, in your
family in everywhere you'll find this light

660
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:49,790
will shine and you'll respect, respect the
hearts of a person.

661
00:51:49,790 --> 00:51:52,470
You'll respect the love of others.

662
00:51:52,470 --> 00:51:57,680
You will respect the spirit that is shining
in others.

663
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:04,910
This is the reason why you have learned to
respect each other, because your spirit is

664
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:05,910
enlightened.

665
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:06,910
I can see it so clearly.

666
00:52:06,910 --> 00:52:13,200
I am so very happy to see so many of you here
for My birthday.

667
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:19,740
I don't know what is the significance of a
birthday is but whatever it is, it is one

668
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:26,170
of the things that I can meet you, all of
you here, so very happy.

669
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:31,589
I am thankful to these people who are elites
of our society.

670
00:52:31,589 --> 00:52:39,500
They are very great people elected and sometimes
given very high positions and also there are

671
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,329
some very well known industrialists.

672
00:52:41,329 --> 00:52:49,180
All of them have to understand the value of
sprititual life.

673
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:52,030
It's very important for them.

674
00:52:52,030 --> 00:53:01,619
Not to avoid this point but to be one with
your spirit is your own property, is in your

675
00:53:01,619 --> 00:53:10,190
own, I should say, the complete glory that
you have is to be the spirit.

676
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:16,799
With all this, I don't know how to thank you
all and how to thank all these people who

677
00:53:16,799 --> 00:53:19,450
spoke so nicely.

678
00:53:19,450 --> 00:53:26,910
Only thing, I wish you all a great growth
in your spiritual life atmonnati, into your

679
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:35,660
spirituality so that it covers all the corners
of the world and create a beautiful world

680
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:36,660
of tomorrow.

681
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:37,480
May God bless you!
