00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.040
Sahaja Yogi: You would try?

00:00:11.640 --> 00:10:34.200
Shri Mataji: Doctor Wells for a while.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:59.000
Sahaja Yogi: All right.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:13:49.067
Shri Mataji: I am requesting&nbsp;
doctor Wells to- not working?

00:13:49.067 --> 00:13:50.147
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

00:13:50.147 --> 00:13:54.320
Shri Mataji: I am requesting him to&nbsp;
say a few words about Sahaja Yoga

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:57.760
because he has done a lot in the research

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:01.720
and he is in charge of seven hospitals in London.

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:04.120
I hope there are some doctors here

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:09.000
so it would be interesting for the&nbsp;
doctors to know the value of Sahaja Yoga

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:15.147
from the medical point of view.

00:14:15.147 --> 00:14:27.136
Sahaja Yogi: Doctor Wells is a clinical&nbsp;
psychologist working in London.

00:14:27.136 --> 00:14:27.146
[Applause]

00:14:27.146 --> 00:14:28.680
Doctor Wells: Good evening ladies and gentlemen.

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.720
Actually, I am not a clinical psychologist,

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.840
I am a psychiatrist.

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:36.240
But I forgive my brother.

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:41.000
It is not an unsusual mistake.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:23:57.870
… Thank you Shri Mataji.

00:23:57.870 --> 00:23:57.880
[Applause]

00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:10.600
[Shri Mataji’s talk starts at 24:35]

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:58.120
I bow to all the Seekers of truth.

00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:26.520
The truth is that we cannot [problems in the mike]

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:47.200
that you cannot change it.

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:57.080
You cannot transform it and&nbsp;
you cannot conceptualize it.

00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:03.280
Also, at this human awareness, you cannot know it.

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:14.040
In the evolutionary process, we have&nbsp;
come to this stage as human beings.

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:18.400
But as we see the problems of the world,

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:34.800
we realize that most of the problems&nbsp;
are coming from human beings.

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:39.160
And all these problems, if you analyse them,

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:46.080
come from the problems of these&nbsp;
centres which are within us,

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:57.600
because these centres cater to your physical,&nbsp;
mental, emotional, and spiritual being.

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:04.320
Of course, in the medical&nbsp;
science, it is not mentioned.

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:06.960
But we have plexuses,

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:13.200
and all these plexuses that we&nbsp;
know of, on a physical level,

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:17.640
are acted upon by these centres.

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:25.800
But as you know, we believe in all specialization.

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:29.400
So, these days, they say that if you&nbsp;
have to have a doctor for this eye,

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:30.840
you go to one doctor.

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:34.360
And for the another eye, to another doctor.

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:40.840
But this is the science of totality, of the whole,

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:52.680
where you have to trigger an energy&nbsp;
which is lying in the sacrum bone.

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:53.320
Just imagine!

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:56.720
It was called sacrum by the Greeks,

00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:58.820
meaning they knew it’s a sacred bone.

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:03.000
Or why did they call it a sacred bone?

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:10.040
This energy to pass through all these centres

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:19.600
to integrate them, to nourish&nbsp;
them, and to enlighten them,

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:23.240
and ultimately to break&nbsp;
through your fontanel bone area

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:26.200
which we call as ‘talu’

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:33.720
to connect it to the All-pervading&nbsp;
Power of Param Chaitanya.

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:37.200
It is described as Ruha in Quran,

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:47.560
it’s described as All-pervading&nbsp;
Power of divine love, in Torah.

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:57.760
Also, it is described in the Bible&nbsp;
as the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost,

00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:03.160
whatever you may call it.

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:14.960
The truth is that you are not this body,&nbsp;
this mind, these conditionings, this ego.

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:19.840
Because you say, “This is my&nbsp;
ego, my conditioning, my body”.

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:24.760
So, ‘my’ stands for which ‘I’?

00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:27.320
To whom does it belong?

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:31.640
There must be someone.

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:33.200
Now who runs your heart?

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:37.320
If you ask a doctor, he’ll say&nbsp;
‘autonomous nervous system’.

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:45.080
But who is the auto?

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:51.720
So, the first truth is that&nbsp;
you are the pure Spirit, first.

00:29:51.720 --> 00:30:00.280
And the second truth is that there is&nbsp;
an All-pervading Power of divine love,

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:03.560
which does all the living work.

00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:13.360
We see these beautiful flowers,&nbsp;
it’s a miracle by itself!

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:19.400
If you see this human body-&nbsp;
doctors must be knowing-

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:23.440
many questions we cannot answer.

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:30.600
For example, any foreign body which&nbsp;
enters into the body is thrown away,

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:32.680
it is the nature’s law.

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:38.800
But when it’s the foetus, it is kept&nbsp;
there till 9 months nicely looked after,

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:41.840
nourished, and then at the&nbsp;
right time, it is thrown away.

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:44.760
How?

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:47.720
There are many other things&nbsp;
which I can talk to doctors,

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:56.000
but at this moment, we have to&nbsp;
understand that science is all right,

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000
but it cannot answer all the questions.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.760
First of all, it is amoral.

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:05.600
Science is amoral

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:11.720
and the second thing is that it&nbsp;
cannot answer many questions.

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:19.360
One of them is why are we on this Earth?

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:27.160
I’m sorry, we are having very marathon programs.

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:36.520
[Shri Mataji is coughing]

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:43.800
So, then we turn to religion, where is the answer?

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:48.760
And then we see the chaos of the religion.

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:54.360
In the name of God, what people are doing here?

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:59.640
We can’t understand these people&nbsp;
who are in charge of religion,

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:06.440
how can they be so corrupt, so money oriented?

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:10.800
And absolutely without any morals.

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:17.480
Any religion, it’s no question of&nbsp;
one religion or another religion.

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:20.840
So, what we find basically,

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:26.640
that all these religions are&nbsp;
either they are power oriented

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:31.920
or they are money oriented or both.

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:35.360
So, every intelligent man gets quite disillusioned

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:38.000
and he doesn’t know what to do.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.320
What’s the use of following such a religion?

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:49.160
It is absolutely a thing by&nbsp;
which you become an atheist.

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:53.080
But it is unscientific to be an atheist,

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:56.360
when you have not found out there is God or not.

00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:58.920
If you see, you say that you are atheist,

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:01.800
you have not been scientific.

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:04.720
First, find out if there is God or not.

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:17.200
If you find it, then you have&nbsp;
to accept that there is God.

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:25.880
Now Sahaja Yoga is not today’s discovery.

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:30.120
It has been there for ages in our country.

00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:31.480
As there are many Indians,

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:38.680
I would say this is your&nbsp;
heritage and ancient science.

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:45.720
For example, we had three&nbsp;
types of seekings, in India.

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:51.640
India has been really blessed by many seekers

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:56.960
because the climate of that country is such.

00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:11.800
In their seeking, some of them followed&nbsp;
the way of finding about matter.

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:16.440
So, they created Vedas.

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:23.080
Another one was ‘bhakti’ because&nbsp;
they could not answer question.

00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:29.800
So, why not we worship God in&nbsp;
any form that we feel like?

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:34.760
But the third one was in the centre

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:44.240
where they talked of ‘atma&nbsp;
sakshatkar’, Self-realisation.

00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:52.560
Sitaji’s father, Raja Janaka, gave&nbsp;
Realization to one gentleman called Nachiketa,

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:56.880
after taking his test for days together.

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:01.800
This system existed more in Maharashtra

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:08.040
where the Nath Panthis used to give Realization.

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:11.080
But the tradition ‘parampara’ was such

00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:18.040
that one Guru will give&nbsp;
Realization to only one person.

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:23.360
Till the time of Dnyaneshwara.

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:26.800
His Guru was his own brother, Nivruttinath.

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:32.080
But Dnyaneshwara took the&nbsp;
permission of his brother

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:39.800
that, “At least, let me write&nbsp;
about how this works out”.

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:45.200
Even in Gita, there’s no mention of Kundalini.

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:51.240
But he wrote Dnyaneshwari, which is,&nbsp;
we can say, the explanation of Gita,

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:56.800
in which in the sixth chapter,&nbsp;
he wrote clearly about Kundalini.

00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:01.000
But people at the helm of affairs,

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:08.560
who did not know how to awaken&nbsp;
the Kundalini, or this power,

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:13.480
said that this chapter is&nbsp;
‘nishiddha’ [prohibited],

00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:15.840
is not to be read.

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:19.480
That’s how the whole thing went into oblivion

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:26.720
and nobody even tried to find out&nbsp;
about this Kundalini awakening.

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:34.040
But after the writing of Dnyanadeva,

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:41.680
there was streams of saints who&nbsp;
came, who were Realized Souls.

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:45.200
You heard the “Jogawa” of Namadeva.

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:49.120
Namdev was in the 16th century [XIII].

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:52.640
And what he says that, “Oh&nbsp;
Mother, give me the yoga,”

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:56.240
means the union, “with this divine Power”.

00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:58.800
In every village you go, in&nbsp;
Maharashtra, they sing it,

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:01.560
but they don’t know what it means.

00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:06.160
They are all asking for it, but&nbsp;
they don’t know what it means.

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:18.960
And we had many, in every part of&nbsp;
India, every province, Realized souls.

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:25.720
Namadeva went to Punjab where Guru&nbsp;
Nanaka very much honoured him,

00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:33.560
and he wrote about Kundalini,&nbsp;
about awakening, about Realization,

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:39.400
in such a big book like that, in Punjabi language.

00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:42.440
Of course, Nanaka Sahib did a great job

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:51.280
by taking all the poems or poetry of&nbsp;
all the saints who were Realized souls,

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:57.080
and put them in Granth Sahib.

00:37:57.080 --> 00:38:01.160
But all their efforts failed.

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:10.624
Kabira says, “Kaise samjhaun, sab jag andhaa?”

00:38:10.624 --> 00:38:10.680
[How to make them understand?&nbsp;
The whole world is blind].

00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:13.640
Also, when they started reading Granth Sahib,

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:16.200
like Gita they read, they read Granth Sahib,

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:20.040
they read, they think by reading.

00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:28.035
So Kabira has said, “Padhi&nbsp;
padhi panditha moorakh bhaye”

00:38:28.035 --> 00:38:28.080
[Reading, reading, the learned became fools].

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:33.720
And in the sixth century&nbsp;
Adi Shankaracharya has said,

00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:37.880
“Mother, remove this shabda jalam [web of words].

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:46.360
These webs of words take me away from you”.

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:50.040
All these things were done;

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:54.640
if you think I’ve done&nbsp;
anything about it, it’s this,

00:38:54.640 --> 00:39:00.320
that I worked out a system,

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:06.880
or you can say, the permutations&nbsp;
and combinations of these chakras

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:16.120
in such a way that a-mass&nbsp;
Realization can be given.

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:17.480
A-mass Realization.

00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:19.240
It’s remarkable.

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:22.480
First, of course, I started with one person.

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:28.680
Then we had about 12 and now I&nbsp;
don’t know, we have in thousands.

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:32.360
Russia, especially, is a very sensitive country.

00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:36.000
Not only Russia, but all the Eastern Block.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:41.960
In all these countries, we&nbsp;
have programs in the stadiums

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:48.200
and never less than 16,000 people at least, never.

00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:51.640
America is very unfortunate that way.

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:55.280
I don’t know about Indians in America.

00:39:55.280 --> 00:40:05.160
But the sensitivity to spirituality has&nbsp;
been dampened by the so-call freedom we had.

00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:09.640
And the materialism, which&nbsp;
made us everything gross,

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:19.560
by this materialism our sensitivity&nbsp;
to spirituality has been dampened.

00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:24.800
Otherwise, for an Indian, his&nbsp;
‘mokha, his atma sakshatkar’

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:32.720
was the highest goal, for anyone.

00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:33.600
How it was done?

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:37.720
They used to go to gurus, this, that.

00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:41.480
But so many false gurus have come up

00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:46.800
as soon as they realized that in&nbsp;
this Kaliyuga, there are many seekers

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:51.640
and that they can befool them, a market is there.

00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:56.360
So, they started marketing.

00:40:56.360 --> 00:41:01.040
We have to use our common sense.

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:04.960
Spirituality, you can achieve through evolution

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:12.800
which is a living process,&nbsp;
living process of your evolution.

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:18.720
Now how much did we pay for our evolution?

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:22.360
Now this Mother Earth gives us all these flowers.

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:24.720
How much do we pay her?

00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:30.640
Nothing, because it’s a living process.

00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:36.280
So, Sahaja Yoga means, ‘sa’&nbsp;
means with; ‘ja’ means born.

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:43.480
It’s the right to achieve&nbsp;
this union with the Divine.

00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:45.560
It’s your right.

00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:50.360
It’s a fundamental right,&nbsp;
especially for Indians, I would say,

00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:53.760
because you are from the Yoga Bhoomi.

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:56.240
We are from the Yoga Bhoomi.

00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:04.560
And this is your fundamental&nbsp;
right to get your Realization.

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:09.320
But it cannot be forced.

00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:12.480
You have to choose it.

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:16.200
You have to ask for it.

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:21.680
You have to have pure desire to get it.

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:26.160
This is the power of pure desire&nbsp;
which we call as Kundalini.

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:32.160
She is your individual mother.

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:34.717
She knows all about you.

00:42:34.717 --> 00:42:39.040
It is all recorded, taped as if, all about you,

00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:43.480
whatever you have done, whatever your desires are,

00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:47.880
it’s all being taped.

00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:54.720
And this mother of yours is anxious&nbsp;
to give you your second birth.

00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:59.080
As in Sanskrit, you know, a Realized&nbsp;
soul is called as ‘dvijaha’,

00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:00.160
born twice,

00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:03.560
and a bird is also called as ‘dvijaha’

00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:08.560
meaning it’s an egg first,&nbsp;
and then a bird it becomes.

00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:11.640
In the same way, we are first human beings

00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:16.000
and then we become enlightened souls.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:21.160
What doctor Wells has told you is nothing&nbsp;
compared to what can happen to you.

00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:23.920
Because it is your own power.

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:26.080
It’s your own.

00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:31.160
And you are not aware how fantastic you are.

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:36.080
You don’t know how many&nbsp;
powers there are within you.

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:39.720
That’s why we do not value it.

00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:44.880
For example, this instrument is made&nbsp;
and is not connected to the mains:

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:47.560
it has no identity, it has no meaning.

00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:54.960
It won’t work, unless and until&nbsp;
we are connected to the mains.

00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:59.640
We have no idea, we are not aware at all

00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:04.840
as to what we are, how fantastic we could be,

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:09.800
what we can do to ourselves and to others.

00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:16.560
It is very important for all of&nbsp;
us to get this Self-realization,

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:19.800
otherwise, there will be&nbsp;
only two status of people:

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:25.080
those who are Self-realized others who are not.

00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:34.640
And as you see, the destructive forces&nbsp;
are working in America of yours.

00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:40.080
How many diseases you have of&nbsp;
which we had never heard before?

00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:44.480
Every time you come, you find&nbsp;
a new disease coming out.

00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:47.960
All these destructive forces,&nbsp;
only on physical level,

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:51.040
then on mental level,

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:56.400
and then on spiritual level.

00:44:56.400 --> 00:45:03.000
So, on one side a man is&nbsp;
getting destroyed from within.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.440
On the other side, from within,

00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:14.920
he is going to ascend and achieve eternal life.

00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:20.000
As a result of this happening, what you get,

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:25.880
first you start feeling on your&nbsp;
fingertips this All-pervading Power.

00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:30.880
For the first time, you feel it.

00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:34.360
You have never felt this&nbsp;
All-pervading Power before.

00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:38.240
For the first time, you start feeling it.

00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:45.360
And also you start feeling this&nbsp;
coming out of your fontanel bone area,

00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:47.320
the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:48.880
You see, you feel it.

00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:53.200
It’s an experience it is not&nbsp;
just a lecture or a sermon.

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:57.000
But it’s an experience which you get.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:00.280
And once you get this experience,

00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:09.880
then you are amazed that you&nbsp;
become absolutely peaceful within.

00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:14.200
People talk of peace, people get&nbsp;
presents, and I’ve seen awards.

00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:15.920
I met them.

00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:17.040
There’s no peace within,

00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:20.760
how can they spread peace&nbsp;
if there’s no peace within?

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:25.800
So, this peace is achieved&nbsp;
automatically within yourself.

00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:31.760
Secondly, you become a witness&nbsp;
of the whole thing, like a drama.

00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:34.480
You’re not anymore involved into your problems,

00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:37.200
and so you can solve them better.

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:43.400
You really become very compassionate&nbsp;
as well as very dynamic.

00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:48.400
Now my age is now going to be&nbsp;
71 years of age and I travel.

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:55.800
Like this morning, I went for 3 and&nbsp;
a half hours onto the mountains.

00:46:56.920 --> 00:47:08.440
And I came here directly after the&nbsp;
function we had, and I I’m all right.

00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:15.800
What helps me is that, I am just a witness.

00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:20.840
I’m just watching.

00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:25.440
Like a drama, the whole thing is happening.

00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:32.400
Thirdly, you develop the sense of Self-knowledge,

00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:35.760
means you know your own chakras.

00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:37.560
You know all your chakras.

00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:40.880
For diagnosis, you don’t have&nbsp;
to go to doctors or anybody,

00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:44.240
you immediately know that you have&nbsp;
this chakra catching, this chakra.

00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:45.840
Even the children will tell you

00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:48.240
because you can feel them on your fingertips.

00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:51.880
5, 6 and 7 and 5, 6 and 7,

00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:59.280
this one is for your left side,&nbsp;
we can say, on the emotional side,

00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:03.200
and this one on the physical and the mental side.

00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:07.200
Immediately, you can feel it.

00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:14.720
And as soon as you feel it, if you&nbsp;
know how to correct it, it’s solved.

00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:19.280
How these problems can be&nbsp;
corrected is very simple.

00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:22.120
If you know that, you are a master.

00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:25.360
You can cure anyone,

00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:36.169
because you also know the centres of&nbsp;
others you can feel, you are aware.

00:48:36.169 --> 00:48:36.200
Marathi, they say ‘janiva’.

00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:38.960
And in Hindi the word is ‘bodha’.

00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:44.040
On your central nervous system, you can feel it.

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:51.520
You can feel that and when you feel&nbsp;
that, you know exactly: decoded.

00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:54.760
And even if you put 10&nbsp;
children and tie up their eyes,

00:48:54.760 --> 00:49:04.160
they say the same thing about a person.

00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:09.200
One thing is, first when I&nbsp;
came to America, I was shocked

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:18.200
because they said, “If you don’t take any&nbsp;
money, then it is hocus focus [deceit]”.

00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:22.760
And for 9 years, I didn’t come.

00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:30.080
Because I thought when people think&nbsp;
money is the only way they can judge you,

00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:33.200
then they can never understand.

00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:38.840
So, all the gurus and all these people&nbsp;
came, made big money, befooled people,

00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:42.440
given them all kinds of problems.

00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:47.160
I don’t mind if they wanted to make money&nbsp;
after all, it’s going on everywhere.

00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:50.280
But they spoiled their kundalinis.

00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:59.360
They spoiled their ascend, which&nbsp;
was very sinful, by mesmerizing.

00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:02.240
I don’t know what all they did.

00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:08.960
As it is today, I must tell you

00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:13.080
that there are thousands and thousands of people

00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:17.080
who have already received their Realization.

00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:20.640
We are working in 55 nations.

00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:25.840
Also, in India, it is spreading like fire.

00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:33.800
Doctor has told you about uh the&nbsp;
doctors who have done research.

00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:41.200
But I tell you, cancer has been&nbsp;
cured with Sahaja Yoga, no doubt.

00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:45.360
Blood cancer has been cured of so many people

00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:48.920
who were told that you are&nbsp;
going to die after 1 month.

00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:50.480
I mean, doctors are honest.

00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:53.920
They certified, “One month, you will die”.

00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:59.080
But they have survived and&nbsp;
survived, some of them are 9 years,

00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:01.840
they are perfectly all right.

00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:06.680
All kinds of psychosomatic&nbsp;
troubles have been cured with this.

00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:11.920
Now doctors should not worry&nbsp;
that they lose their patients,

00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:13.720
they will not.

00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:16.280
Because how many people come to Sahaja Yoga?

00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:20.800
Just see now.

00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:23.560
How many there are?

00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:26.720
So, most of them will be left to the doctor’s lot.

00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:29.480
They shouldn’t worry about that one.

00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:40.080
Only those who are specially blessed&nbsp;
by wisdom will come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:50.320
And thus, those people who are&nbsp;
seeking the truth will be blessed,

00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:54.160
and they will get the benefit of this.

00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:57.840
But one has to have basic wisdom.

00:51:57.840 --> 00:52:01.840
Sahaja Yoga is not meant for&nbsp;
idiots and stupid people.

00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:06.040
I mean, you see, there are so&nbsp;
many idiotic people in this world,

00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:08.360
such a great percentage,

00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:17.000
that we are surprised that how there are&nbsp;
also so many destructive and horrible people.

00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:32.640
or what you call as the&nbsp;
Qyama, in the Quran, is now.

00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:36.840
And every type of souls are taking birth.

00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:38.960
Some of them are cruel.

00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:41.280
Some are like animals.

00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:45.440
Some are absolutely hopeless cases.

00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:48.800
Nothing can work out with them.

00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:55.240
But also, there are many, many seekers of truth

00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:58.480
and they achieve it – many!

00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:02.520
In Nala-Damayantri kahan [story], it is written

00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:06.160
that Damayanti was separated from Nala.

00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:08.840
And one day, Nala got hold of this Kali.

00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:10.360
And he said, Now I’m going to kill you

00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:15.520
because you are such a person who&nbsp;
puts people into ‘bhranti’ [illusion].

00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:17.120
So, I’m going to kill you.

00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:18.640
He said, All right, you can kill me.

00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:23.440
But first, understand my ‘mahatme’,&nbsp;
know what my importance is.

00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:27.040
My importance is that when Kaliyuga will come,

00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:34.080
all these people who are seeking me in&nbsp;
the valleys and in the mountains, [Hindi],

00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:38.560
they will all be reborn and&nbsp;
they will get their Realization.

00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:42.320
So, Nala said, “Then no, I will not kill you”.

00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:47.160
And this is what Kaliyuga&nbsp;
is, it’s the ‘ghor Kaliyuga’.

00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:54.120
Because I told you all kinds of souls&nbsp;
are taking birth, ‘ghor Kaliyuga’.

00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:59.640
And in this ‘ghor Kaliyuga’,&nbsp;
this is going to work out.

00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:03.240
I’m happy today I’m meeting so many of you here.

00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:10.080
Somehow or other, I feel this year it is&nbsp;
reaching the message to the Indians quite a lot.

00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:12.520
Also in New York, I was surprised

00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:19.320
how they felt they should take to Sahaja Yoga.

00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:24.640
So, I have to tell you that&nbsp;
it will take hardly 10 minutes

00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:28.320
for you to get your&nbsp;
Realization, not more than that.

00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:32.680
But those who do not want I cannot force on you.

00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:34.600
All such people should leave the hall.

00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:37.440
It’s hardly 10 minutes, it will take.

00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:41.920
But after, like sprouting the&nbsp;
seed, you have to look after it,

00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:44.600
at the most for a month.

00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:46.640
And you become masters.

00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:50.840
You will become masters of&nbsp;
this art and you can do a lot.

00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:54.560
There are so many miracles of Sahaja Yoga,

00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:56.680
not only on physical level, otherwise also,

00:54:56.680 --> 00:55:02.160
on material level, financial level, all kinds

00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:09.480
that I asked Phil Ward, who was playing&nbsp;
on the harmonium, to compile them.

00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:12.360
Because so many letters coming to me.

00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:16.840
And within one month, he told me that,&nbsp;
‘It has piled about to my head now.

00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:17.920
How am I to select?”

00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:23.320
I said, “Forget it”.

00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:25.000
Because you’re are fantastic.

00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:35.160
Supposing you take one television&nbsp;
set in a remote village,

00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:37.600
where they have not seen electricity,

00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:41.200
and tell them you can see&nbsp;
here lots of films and things.

00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:45.112
They’ll say, “What is this box? ”

00:55:45.112 --> 00:55:45.120
You see.

00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:48.360
We also think we are all just boxes.

00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:49.640
No!

00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:51.440
Once you are put to the mains, you’ll see,

00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:55.200
because it is built in within you.

00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:57.480
It is just built in.

00:55:57.480 --> 00:56:01.160
Please understand that nothing&nbsp;
is to be built anymore.

00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:08.160
It is already there, very well planned,&nbsp;
in the center, as shown, is there.

00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:10.720
Only once the awakening takes place,

00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:16.320
you will feel this All-pervading Power.

00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:20.400
And all of you are going to get it, I assure you.

00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:23.240
You all are going to get it just now.

00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:29.800
But again, I would say, those&nbsp;
who want to go, please go away.

00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:34.600
And also, I know you all have lots of questions.

00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:40.200
So many questions are there

00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:45.680
and for the last 25 years, I’ve been&nbsp;
doing nothing but answering questions.

00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:47.920
I’m quite an expert.

00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:51.960
But still, I would say it’s a mental acrobat.

00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:54.880
We have to go beyond mind

00:56:55.960 --> 00:57:02.520
because mental projection&nbsp;
is limited you know that.

00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:08.240
Even then, if you have questions, you&nbsp;
can write to me, I’ll answer them.

00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:11.320
But not important at this moment.

00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:21.080
Only have faith and self-confidence&nbsp;
that you will all get your Realization.

00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:24.800
It’s very simple and will work out.

00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:32.160
I’m sorry for this really Indian&nbsp;
style program we had today.

00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:35.520
It was arranged at a very late stage

00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:39.480
and we had already this big seminar there,

00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:43.320
and then we rushed through and lost our way also.

00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:44.760
I don’t know what happened.

00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:47.760
And then, we reached here.

00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:51.560
But still it has worked out.

00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:54.800
We have to have some patience with ourselves also.

00:57:55.640 --> 00:58:00.720
And also respect of our Self-realization.

00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:08.080
People get their Self-realization all&nbsp;
right, and then they feel very happy,

00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:13.520
“Oh, I’m very happy. I’m the seventh&nbsp;
heaven this. I do it at home”.

00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:15.960
It’s not going to work out now.

00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:22.360
It’s a collective happening, it’s&nbsp;
a collective organism which works.

00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:26.480
For example, if a nail is&nbsp;
cut out, it will never grow.

00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:28.400
We have centres here.

00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:30.080
Of course, we don’t take any money.

00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:35.080
So, we don’t have Taj mahals&nbsp;
and things to do the worship.

00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:38.880
It’s simple.

00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:51.240
And if you people take some trouble for&nbsp;
some time, you can yourself master it.

00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:56.200
You see, here, today, they were&nbsp;
singing Indian songs so clearly.

00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:57.880
They have composed it.

00:58:57.880 --> 00:59:02.560
They have put the tune to it,&nbsp;
and they sing it so clearly.

00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:08.400
Even in Sanskrit, you see, they sing the&nbsp;
song which Adi Shankaracharya has written,

00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:13.360
which we cannot sing clearly.

00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:18.760
Some change has taken place, you can see.

00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:23.520
We have here people from all over&nbsp;
the world today, you’ll be surprised.

00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:31.760
Even from Australia, we have from&nbsp;
Iran, from every place we have.

00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:41.480
And it is very surprisingly&nbsp;
how they relate to each other,

00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:46.200
how they love each other,&nbsp;
how they help each other.

00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:52.200
They go to any country, they have&nbsp;
their brothers and sisters there.

00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:56.640
And there is no problem of lust and greet.

00:59:56.640 --> 01:00:00.960
It’s not like this, somebody’s wife runs&nbsp;
away with some- never, never, never,

01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:02.600
these things never come.

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:14.280
Their eyes have become so innocent and so simple

01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:17.680
that there is no lust and greed.

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:22.800
My husband used to always say&nbsp;
that I am an ‘awliya’ myself.

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:24.560
“But I can’t make others”, always used to say.

01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:28.400
Now he has seen.

01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:30.640
So, he said, “I give up. I am an honest man.

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:34.200
I must accept that this is something really,

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:36.640
you have made them into angels”.

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:47.560
That’s a fact, we have people here from&nbsp;
Japan, from Singapore, from all over,

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:54.640
but if you see them, there’s&nbsp;
such ‘bhaichara’ as they say,

01:00:54.640 --> 01:01:04.120
No competition, no jealousies,&nbsp;
nothing, pure relationship.

01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:11.160
It’s the purity because they have&nbsp;
become absolutely pure, ‘khalis’.

01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:18.240
We have established the&nbsp;
Khalistan, because we are khalis.

01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:24.440
This is what Kanak sahib has&nbsp;
said that, Become “khalis”.

01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:32.880
Whatever they have said has gone&nbsp;
to waste now, all being twisted,

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:43.360
I don’t know, just for money and for power.

01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:46.280
We have lots of Muslims, some are here.

01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:49.720
Yesterday, I had programs with Muslims and Jews.

01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:52.760
There were quite a lot of people again.

01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:58.680
They are all taking to it now, and&nbsp;
understanding that there’s something missing,

01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:02.520
the way we are being destroyed.

01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:08.920
And we too also, as Indians have&nbsp;
to know, that this is our heritage.

01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:13.200
Medical Science has come from Western life.

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:19.420
These, this is the science&nbsp;
of the roots, our roots!

01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:25.440
It takes no time to know it ,and to understand.

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:28.040
I also did my medicine and I used to wonder,

01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:32.880
“How will I be able to talk to doctors? ”

01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:40.320
And the psychiatrist and&nbsp;
psychologist have vanished,

01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:43.360
because they see the proof, it is tangible.

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:48.240
We can scientifically prove that it is so.

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:53.240
You can see with your naked eyes in&nbsp;
some people, the rising of the power,

01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:56.240
but in very few, where there is some obstruction.

01:02:56.240 --> 01:03:00.600
Normally, it works like a jet.

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:04.440
So, now I think you are all&nbsp;
ready to have your socialization

01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:24.280
and we’ll work it out.

01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:25.800
[Self-realisation introduction]

01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:29.280
Just one thing we have to&nbsp;
do is to take out our shoes

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:34.600
because this Mother Earth helps us a&nbsp;
lot to take our problems to absorb them.

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:48.080
Just take them out and you’ll&nbsp;
feel very comfortable also.

01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:55.760
Now Dr Wells will tell you how&nbsp;
to nourish your own centres

01:03:55.760 --> 01:04:01.680
which will be doing only tonight, that’s all.

01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:08.280
But there are three conditions.

01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:17.880
The first one is that you have&nbsp;
to be absolutely self-confident

01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:22.020
that you will all get your&nbsp;
Self-realization tonight.

01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:28.880
You should be absolutely self-confident,

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:48.080
that means you forget your past, that&nbsp;
means that in no way, to condemn yourself.

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:50.240
You should be pleasantly placed towards yourself

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:56.960
because you are human being which&nbsp;
is at the epitome of evolution.

01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:02.200
And it will take hardly a little journey;

01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:08.880
at the most from 3 to 4 feet, that’s all.

01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:18.760
The second condition follows that&nbsp;
you should have no guilt at all.

01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:22.040
Indians don’t have so much as the Westerners have.

01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:27.160
I don’t know why, they feel&nbsp;
guilty for everything, you know.

01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:35.960
If they put the spoon on this side, and&nbsp;
this on that side, they feel guilty.

01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:37.960
Indians that way are better but I don’t know.

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:42.780
Maybe you might have imbibed some&nbsp;
of the qualities of the Americans.

01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:44.720
[Laughter]

01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:50.840
If you have done any mistake, all&nbsp;
right, face it and finish it off.

01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:57.200
But what’s the use of feeling guilty&nbsp;
and thinking have done this wrong?

01:05:57.200 --> 01:06:03.400
I know of some people who go on thinking&nbsp;
about small things like spilling a coffee.

01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:08.440
All their lives they think, “We spill the coffee”.

01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:11.560
[Laughter]

01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:19.640
So, nothing is so serious.

01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:25.540
And this All-pervading Power&nbsp;
is the ocean of forgiveness.

01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:32.720
And whatever wrong you have done can&nbsp;
be easily dissolved by that ocean.

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:36.960
So, now don’t think that you&nbsp;
are guilty by any chance.

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:41.160
But physically, from science&nbsp;
point of view, it is different.

01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:44.400
But from Sahaja Yoga point of view,

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:50.600
if you feel guilty you get the center&nbsp;
on the left-hand side of the Vishuddhi

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:52.720
in a jeopardy, in trouble.

01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:58.080
And once you get this center caught&nbsp;
up, you might get spondylitis.

01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:01.960
You might get angina.

01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:05.160
Angina is because of that, angina.

01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:09.840
Thirdly, you might get lethargic organs.

01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:11.920
It’s a very serious thing.

01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:21.920
So, why to have those serious things&nbsp;
in ourselves by feeling guilty?

01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:28.080
As the men are women also feel guilty&nbsp;
for something very, very trivial.

01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:31.080
But what a serious thing that happens!

01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:47.600
So, please don’t feel guilty at&nbsp;
all, not at all, about anything.

01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:50.720
Especially at this moment,&nbsp;
when the Kundalini is rising,

01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:53.920
and you are- this center is catching.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Then it won’t go through this centre.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:13.480
Nowadays also, people think&nbsp;
that if they starve themselves,

01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:21.360
or if they stand on their&nbsp;
heads, or maybe go to Himalayas,

01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:23.840
they will get Realization. No.

01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:31.280
God is your father.

01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:38.600
He is ocean of compassion, why&nbsp;
would he like you to suffer?

01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:46.400
Think of any father who makes his child suffer?

01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:56.640
So, also, this idea of fasting and&nbsp;
all this this suffering is all absurd.

01:08:56.640 --> 01:08:59.160
Some people talk of karmas.

01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:03.400
When this center opens, on&nbsp;
the optic chiasma, like this,

01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:05.360
all your karmas are sucked in.

01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:10.000
Doctor can show them, on the yellow side.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.320
These are all your karmas your ego.

01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:16.040
And the left-side are your conditionings.

01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:18.840
They are all sucked in.

01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:21.960
So, you become ‘akarmis’ |[without any karma].

01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:25.360
Only the human beings think&nbsp;
that they have done karmas.

01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:31.160
The dogs and the tigers don’t think,

01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:34.240
because they are ‘pashu’, they are&nbsp;
in the ‘pash’ [control] of God,

01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:35.600
so they don’t think.

01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:36.600
We have freedom.

01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:43.440
So, we think we have done this wrong,&nbsp;
that wrong, or our ego sometimes,

01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:45.400
“I am this, I am that”.

01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:49.880
All that is sucked in by the Kundalini.

01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:53.720
I’m just removing some of&nbsp;
your thoughts which are there.

01:09:57.240 --> 01:10:01.840
So, please don’t try in any way to&nbsp;
condemn yourself or judge yourself.

01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:07.080
Let the Kundalini judge, she knows.

01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:11.640
And as the mother that you had gave you birth,

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:14.320
taking all the trouble upon herself,

01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:19.320
this Kundalini doesn’t trouble you at all.

01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:22.600
She very delicately, beautifully, rises

01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:29.080
and pierces through this fontanel bone area.

01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:36.960
And you get the actualization of your&nbsp;
baptism, or your state of second birth.

01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:39.280
Actualization, again.

01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:45.200
In Sahaja Yoga, we don’t have to say, “Don’t&nbsp;
do something”, as doctor has told you.

01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:48.120
You just automatically become that.

01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:51.200
Automatically, you become righteous.

01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:52.760
Nothing is to be said, “Don’t do”.

01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:55.600
Nothing, it just happens.

01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:59.640
For this, I have to give&nbsp;
you a very simple example.

01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:03.880
If you have a snake in your&nbsp;
hand, say, I’m holding a snake

01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:05.560
and I’m an obstinate person.

01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:06.760
There is darkness.

01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:10.800
Somebody says, “This is a snake”.

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:13.680
I’ll say, “No, it is a rope”.

01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:17.000
Till the snake bites me, I’ll say, “It’s a rope”.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:22.680
But if there is little light,&nbsp;
I’ll just throw it away myself.

01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:23.920
Nobody has to tell me anything.

01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:27.240
In this way, it happens.

01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:30.080
So, please have no guilt.

01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:33.760
And the third condition is even simple.

01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:37.240
It’s to forgive everyone, in general,

01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:40.560
without thinking of the people&nbsp;
whom you have to forgive.

01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:45.080
Now here, people will say, “It’s&nbsp;
very difficult”. Many people say.

01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:53.640
Logically, whether you forgive&nbsp;
or don’t forgive, what do you do?

01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:56.000
It’s a myth.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.840
You don’t do anything, it’s a myth.

01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:03.960
But if you don’t forgive, then&nbsp;
you play into wrong hands.

01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:11.960
Those who try to trouble you are&nbsp;
happy, but you are torturing yourself.

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:16.200
But at this moment, especially,&nbsp;
the center of Agnya,

01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:21.200
which is like this, like a&nbsp;
cross, is absolutely constricted.

01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:23.480
If you don’t forgive, it will never open.

01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:29.640
Just to feel that, “I forgive&nbsp;
everyone” without thinking about them,

01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:30.960
it opens.

01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:33.480
And then the Kundalini will rise.

01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:36.760
As it is, you have tortured&nbsp;
yourself by not forgiving.

01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:41.160
And now, at this moment,&nbsp;
please, don’t miss the point.

01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:45.680
Just you have to say, “I forgive everyone”,

01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:50.680
without even thinking about them, in general.

01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:57.480
I hope I have been able to convince&nbsp;
you logically what is important.

01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:01.760
These are the only three simple conditions.

01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:07.800
And now, we’ll show you how we will&nbsp;
nourish our centres, on the left-hand side.

01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:10.080
And then you have to close your eyes,

01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:14.640
and again we have to do the same&nbsp;
thing, which is very simple.

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:21.014
Again I say, it’s nothing difficult.

01:13:21.014 --> 01:13:21.040
[Self-realisation process]

01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:28.080
So, please, understand there&nbsp;
are two powers, left and right,

01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:32.000
so both the feet should apart from each other.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:36.640
And left hand should be&nbsp;
comfortably placed on your lap.

01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:38.920
You have to sit comfortably.

01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:40.800
I told you, you don’t have to go to Himalayas,

01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:44.160
here on your seat, you’ll get your Realisation.
