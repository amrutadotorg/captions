1
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:07,857
Today we are going to worship Shri Krishna as Yogeshwara.

2
00:00:11,508 --> 00:00:23,033
As it is, you know that Vishnu’s first incarnation as a human being

3
00:00:23,782 --> 00:00:25,460
was Vamana avatar.

4
00:00:27,745 --> 00:00:36,610
And then went till He came as Shri Ram.

5
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:44,567
So, the past of Shri Krishna was Shri Ram.

6
00:00:44,805 --> 00:00:47,405
And when Shri Rama came on this earth,

7
00:00:48,436 --> 00:00:53,416
He went into lots of austerities, to go to jungle,

8
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:57,325
His wife was lost, whom He had to find out.

9
00:00:58,019 --> 00:01:02,932
And to establish the benevolent king

10
00:01:04,381 --> 00:01:13,785
on this earth, He was made the king of Ayodhya.

11
00:01:17,594 --> 00:01:28,210
But all His life it was a struggle
and austerities which He followed.

12
00:01:29,282 --> 00:01:32,349
As a result, the people who followed Shri Ram

13
00:01:32,536 --> 00:01:34,976
became extremely austere.

14
00:01:36,008 --> 00:01:41,524
They used to sleep on the grass

15
00:01:42,655 --> 00:01:46,788
because Shri Ram had to sleep on the grass for so many years.

16
00:01:47,784 --> 00:01:51,831
They used to wear wooden slippers.

17
00:01:53,042 --> 00:01:59,391
They would just wear very little clothes or one dhoti,

18
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:03,835
just like Shri Rama wore when His wife was out.

19
00:02:04,511 --> 00:02:12,304
All these austerities they did to show how a householder should be.

20
00:02:13,892 --> 00:02:20,955
He never enjoyed any other life as a man,

21
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:29,308
but just lived like an ascetic when His wife was lost.

22
00:02:32,493 --> 00:02:38,654
All these things were to establish also a very

23
00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:46,412
ideal personality for a man to be attached to His wife.

24
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:52,959
He was a person with Ekapatnivrata, means: one wife.

25
00:02:53,972 --> 00:02:58,859
Though She knew She was Mahalakshmi, She was a Goddess,

26
00:02:59,574 --> 00:03:10,109
but still He was forced to do things

27
00:03:10,387 --> 00:03:14,254
because He wanted to show how a benevolent king should be.

28
00:03:19,197 --> 00:03:24,554
In the second incarnation of His, when He came as Shri Krishna,

29
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:32,868
then He had to neutralize
all these austerities He has put on people.

30
00:04:17,744 --> 00:04:22,645
– Ha. So, Shri Krishna came on this earth.

31
00:04:27,388 --> 00:04:32,741
In His childhood He had to also face lots of

32
00:04:32,999 --> 00:04:35,915
problems which He surpassed,

33
00:04:39,467 --> 00:04:46,808
and He went and killed His uncle, as you know very well,

34
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,712
who was a rakshasa.

35
00:04:50,705 --> 00:04:57,761
After doing all this, then He went to Dwarika, which He built

36
00:04:58,198 --> 00:05:00,877
– now they have found out where is Dwarika

37
00:05:01,075 --> 00:05:03,475
– and He became the king of Dwarika.

38
00:05:09,806 --> 00:05:11,606
To understand Shri Krishna

39
00:05:13,675 --> 00:05:19,127
in Sahaja Yoga is much more subtler
than the stories that they tell.

40
00:05:19,247 --> 00:05:21,180
[aside] … move it – better. ?

41
00:05:21,608 --> 00:05:24,842
The stories are there,

42
00:05:25,239 --> 00:05:27,500
but behind these stories,

43
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:31,499
as being Sahaja Yogis, you have to see the subtle things

44
00:05:31,886 --> 00:05:35,199
about His incarnation.

45
00:05:36,231 --> 00:05:41,145
So, the first one was, He was Leeladhara,

46
00:05:42,297 --> 00:05:45,163
means the One who said this is all a play.

47
00:05:47,059 --> 00:05:49,792
That means you have to become a witness.

48
00:05:50,709 --> 00:05:54,509
So, He said that your mind should become just a witness.

49
00:05:57,336 --> 00:06:01,500
At Virata stage He becomes Akbar.

50
00:06:02,215 --> 00:06:08,623
And at that stage He is the mind, the brain of

51
00:06:11,123 --> 00:06:12,990
the great primordial Being.

52
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:21,976
So, first He thinks that we have to become witness,

53
00:06:23,415 --> 00:06:24,882
witness of the drama,

54
00:06:26,232 --> 00:06:33,803
and we should not get lost into the Maya.

55
00:06:35,192 --> 00:06:41,541
If you are a witness you can see the Maya, how it works.

56
00:06:42,672 --> 00:06:51,751
So the first, first subtle nature
of Shri Krishna was to create a Leela

57
00:06:52,109 --> 00:06:58,378
to neutralize all the austerities
created by the incarnation of Shri Rama.

58
00:06:59,529 --> 00:07:04,124
But the second great quality

59
00:07:05,295 --> 00:07:10,612
that He had is also to put the Maya on people.

60
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:19,362
So, if He is the brain, our brain should become a sakshi,

61
00:07:20,295 --> 00:07:24,525
should become a witness, witness the play.

62
00:07:25,339 --> 00:07:31,469
You should not take anything as something extremely serious.

63
00:07:32,303 --> 00:07:36,172
When you look at things as sakshi swarupa, as

64
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:39,064
something that you are watching a drama,

65
00:07:39,406 --> 00:07:44,882
you may for the time being feel that you are Napoleon,
you are the one who is acting.

66
00:07:45,061 --> 00:07:47,458
But after some time the play is over,

67
00:07:47,617 --> 00:07:52,974
you know it’s a play. So, to reach that state, you have to

68
00:07:54,165 --> 00:07:58,609
become thoughtlessly aware.

69
00:07:59,701 --> 00:08:02,359
Because we think from our brain,

70
00:08:03,213 --> 00:08:07,557
and this brain goes on thinking, thinking, creating a Maya,

71
00:08:08,371 --> 00:08:10,436
and playing into Maya.

72
00:08:11,126 --> 00:08:17,381
Now, here it is when you are a realized soul,
you should see through the Maya.

73
00:08:18,472 --> 00:08:24,325
Everything that I am doing or you are doing,

74
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:33,816
should be understood very well if you are really

75
00:08:35,344 --> 00:08:39,252
the reflection of Shri Krishna’s brain.

76
00:08:40,761 --> 00:08:45,106
So, in your brain, there should be no worry,

77
00:08:45,562 --> 00:08:49,229
there should be no stress, there should be no problem,

78
00:08:51,396 --> 00:08:55,395
because you are just watching everything

79
00:08:55,713 --> 00:08:58,173
 in thoughtless awareness.

80
00:08:58,868 --> 00:09:01,535
So, when you are thoughtless awareness,

81
00:09:02,102 --> 00:09:07,994
means when your brain is just in the state of witness,

82
00:09:09,245 --> 00:09:14,257
you understand everything that is Divine.

83
00:09:14,575 --> 00:09:17,775
I’ll give you an example, just now it happened.

84
00:09:17,928 --> 00:09:22,571
I got into the car and they didn’t know where to go,

85
00:09:23,286 --> 00:09:27,419
and we went onto wrong road, then I told him ” Go this way “.

86
00:09:28,226 --> 00:09:32,493
So he was wondering ” How Mother knows?” I said ” Vibrations! ”

87
00:09:34,878 --> 00:09:38,904
Through vibrations I could feel we are ther
– they are all there, sitting there,

88
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:40,496
– and we came round.

89
00:09:43,468 --> 00:09:49,135
Unless and untill you are thoughtlessly aware,
you cannot grow, that is first thing.

90
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:57,019
And secondly, unless and until you are thoughtlessly aware,
you do not know the absolute Truth.

91
00:09:58,369 --> 00:10:00,969
Through your brain only you will know.

92
00:10:01,997 --> 00:10:06,464
You don’t have to put your hands, you don’t have to ask questions.

93
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:12,465
But it’s like a computer that works, it just gives you an answer.

94
00:10:13,597 --> 00:10:17,197
In that state you are completely one with the Divine,

95
00:10:17,406 --> 00:10:20,362
and it just gives you an answer,

96
00:10:20,819 --> 00:10:24,686
and you do that and you are amazed how it has worked out.

97
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:29,943
Everything, every moment is computerized with Shri Krishna.

98
00:10:32,121 --> 00:10:35,553
But at the same time He tests you,

99
00:10:36,982 --> 00:10:41,089
He plays His Leela on you. That one must know,

100
00:10:41,744 --> 00:10:43,411
because He’s a diplomat.

101
00:10:44,621 --> 00:10:49,419
How He has played Leela on you is very interesting to see,

102
00:10:50,531 --> 00:10:51,797
His style of Leela.

103
00:10:53,943 --> 00:10:55,410
Like He’s told Arjuna

104
00:10:59,082 --> 00:11:00,882
that ” I will not fight “.

105
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:07,157
Arjuna said: ” All right, what will you do? ”

106
00:11:07,316 --> 00:11:10,729
” I’ll be your charioteer,

107
00:11:11,049 --> 00:11:12,716
I’ll drive your chariot.

108
00:11:13,311 --> 00:11:17,404
” Now it would look funny to anybody: ”
What is this, such a great man

109
00:11:17,663 --> 00:11:19,956
who calls me as His guru,

110
00:11:20,214 --> 00:11:22,347
He says that He is the one who,

111
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:25,750
I mean, He says that I am the best of His disciples,

112
00:11:25,889 --> 00:11:30,556
everything, and here He just offers
His services like a charioteer. ”

113
00:11:32,238 --> 00:11:40,444
In this, He is just trying a trick on Arjuna.

114
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:47,270
As if He knows the future that’s going to happen.

115
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:54,611
So, the whole Gita was created because He was just a charioteer,

116
00:11:55,705 --> 00:11:59,871
because Arjuna said ” I cannot fight my own people,

117
00:12:00,948 --> 00:12:08,300
I cannot fight my own grandparents,
and I cannot fight my relations. ”

118
00:12:10,086 --> 00:12:13,486
Now, if you say that Gita is for peace, it is not.

119
00:12:16,118 --> 00:12:17,518
It is not for peace.

120
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:23,864
But He says that: ” They are already dead, whom are you killing?

121
00:12:25,582 --> 00:12:29,649
These dead people, if you are killing them what will happen?

122
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:34,617
But if you now run away from the battlefield,

123
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:38,426
people will call you a coward,

124
00:12:40,272 --> 00:12:44,139
and what will you get? But if you fight for the religion,

125
00:12:46,284 --> 00:12:52,657
then you will get your resurrection – moksha.”

126
00:12:53,947 --> 00:12:56,480
It’s a big trick in all these things.

127
00:12:57,299 --> 00:13:02,688
Same was said by Mohammed Sahib, and same by Christians later,

128
00:13:03,344 --> 00:13:10,168
same about the Hindus
– that they all feel they are fighting for Dharma.

129
00:13:13,582 --> 00:13:16,382
In Arjuna’s case, it was a clear-cut case

130
00:13:16,935 --> 00:13:21,351
that somebody was a rakshasa and horrible people,

131
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:25,557
they were adharmis, so He was fighting them, it’s all right.

132
00:13:28,554 --> 00:13:34,287
But what about other people when they say that ” We are going to

133
00:13:34,665 --> 00:13:41,724
die for religion “? I met a Bosnia muslim
who had just somewhere escaped

134
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:45,644
and I asked Him ” Why, why do you want to fight?

135
00:13:45,823 --> 00:13:53,938
Why do you want to fight for land
when you believe in the formless God? ”

136
00:13:54,335 --> 00:13:58,573
He said: ” It’s written in the Koran that if you fight for religion

137
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:03,737
then you will get your moksha.
” Exactly the same Shri Krishna has said.

138
00:14:06,867 --> 00:14:08,600
But where is the mistake?

139
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:13,731
The mistake is: what is the Dharma?

140
00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:22,260
Are you dharmic? Are you in – standing in Dharma?

141
00:14:24,053 --> 00:14:29,224
Then this fight was in those days, were with weapons.

142
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:33,612
So, why did Shri Krishna not take a weapon in His hand?

143
00:14:35,434 --> 00:14:40,116
This is the second. Firstly, nobody has Dharma,

144
00:14:40,395 --> 00:14:43,866
they’re all adharmis
– they may call themselves hindus, muslims, christians

145
00:14:44,006 --> 00:14:46,857
– all are adharmis, they don’t follow the religion.

146
00:14:46,976 --> 00:14:51,301
And secondly, they are killing each other only,

147
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,774
one adharmi killing other adharmi,

148
00:14:53,901 --> 00:14:57,095
or maybe in between themselves they are fighting: everybody

149
00:14:57,234 --> 00:15:01,568
is thinking ” I am right and whatever I am doing is the right. ”

150
00:15:02,332 --> 00:15:06,732
So, the first condition is put that for Dharma you have to fight.

151
00:15:06,892 --> 00:15:10,826
So first, one should find out: are we fighting for Dharma?

152
00:15:12,964 --> 00:15:15,106
But He was even subtler,

153
00:15:15,801 --> 00:15:19,134
He didn’t take any weapons in His hands, nothing.

154
00:15:19,841 --> 00:15:24,066
He was just holding the reins of the chariot.

155
00:15:25,753 --> 00:15:28,908
Because Shri Krishna is the mind,

156
00:15:29,325 --> 00:15:34,701
is the Virat, is the great Mind,
He doesn’t need any weapons or such.

157
00:15:35,952 --> 00:15:37,952
But what He did at that time,

158
00:15:38,214 --> 00:15:44,657
He used His mind for a very very profound knowledge,

159
00:15:45,927 --> 00:15:49,127
to explain to Arjuna. Imagine, in the warfield,

160
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:53,167
He didn’t make Him sit down
” All right, you are my Shishya, you sit here,

161
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,486
I am your guru, I’ll tell you. ”

162
00:15:56,084 --> 00:15:58,684
– nothing. In the battlefield you see,

163
00:15:59,755 --> 00:16:06,453
when everybody was there to fight
and they were about to start the war,

164
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:16,095
He starts telling very patiently to Arjuna, at that time.

165
00:16:17,564 --> 00:16:22,725
Now, what is He doing there? He’s not using any weapons, nothing.

166
00:16:22,904 --> 00:16:31,277
He is being counselling, counselling to Arjuna, telling him.

167
00:16:33,103 --> 00:16:36,019
Now, see His subtle brain.

168
00:16:38,162 --> 00:16:41,773
He introduces in the first chapter only that

169
00:16:41,892 --> 00:16:44,892
” You have to go higher then what you are. ”

170
00:16:46,326 --> 00:16:48,421
And then He gives him

171
00:16:48,858 --> 00:16:54,391
the definition of a person who
is an enlightened person which is a Sthitha Pragya.

172
00:16:56,516 --> 00:17:00,088
I mean, normally, a businessman will start

173
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:04,036
from one dollar, then hundred dollars,
you see, the other way round.

174
00:17:04,215 --> 00:17:06,925
But He told him first thing

175
00:17:07,481 --> 00:17:12,014
that ” You have to become a Sthitha Pragya, otherwise it’s no use.”

176
00:17:13,392 --> 00:17:17,992
Unless and until you become
Sthitha Pragya you cannot have Dharma,

177
00:17:18,155 --> 00:17:19,422
this is the point.

178
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:23,316
To understand Shri Krishna, you have to really have a very

179
00:17:23,432 --> 00:17:25,836
subtle brain, otherwise you cannot understand.

180
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:30,933
So, He tells that ” You should

181
00:17:32,004 --> 00:17:37,797
give up this kind of a morose that has developed in you,

182
00:17:37,897 --> 00:17:39,644
Kaivalya I will call it.

183
00:17:40,498 --> 00:17:44,803
And what you have to do, now take up the weapon in your hand

184
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:46,469
and fight. ”

185
00:17:51,212 --> 00:17:56,782
So, then, He asked him about other things,

186
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:01,921
” What about that: You are here telling me

187
00:18:02,139 --> 00:18:04,339
that you should become Nishkriya,

188
00:18:05,016 --> 00:18:09,701
that means “no work”. Your karmas become akarmas.

189
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,586
Now, talking like this,

190
00:18:11,746 --> 00:18:15,946
and why do you want me to kill these people – that is akarma? ”

191
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,042
Now, how you see, slowly removes from one point

192
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:25,010
that you should fight for Dharma. Now, it’s a very subtle thing:

193
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:28,457
are you in Dharma or not, first of all find out?

194
00:18:29,456 --> 00:18:34,971
You are not, so what Dharma you fight, first?

195
00:18:35,468 --> 00:18:38,225
Then, the second thing is karma.

196
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:45,736
Again, see, He is a brainy fellow, the brains of God,

197
00:18:46,461 --> 00:18:48,266
extremely tricky.

198
00:18:49,202 --> 00:18:54,162
The second trick He plays on Him saying that

199
00:18:56,305 --> 00:19:05,566
” You are working, all right? But if you are a Sthitha Pragya,

200
00:19:07,392 --> 00:19:13,205
then you leave all the work at the lotus feet of God ” or Him.

201
00:19:14,277 --> 00:19:17,510
[Hindi phrase, UNCLEAR]

202
00:19:17,888 --> 00:19:20,209
“Give up all Dharmas and follow Me. ”

203
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,927
Now what is his Dharma?

204
00:19:25,244 --> 00:19:27,997
That problem is that people don’t understand Him.

205
00:19:28,136 --> 00:19:31,608
It’s all concentrated on Shri Krishna, and

206
00:19:31,767 --> 00:19:36,727
His own manifestation.

207
00:19:37,224 --> 00:19:39,168
[aside]

208
00:19:43,335 --> 00:19:46,540
He says that ” Do your karmas.

209
00:19:47,315 --> 00:19:51,501
But you put them at the lotus feet of the Lord! ”

210
00:19:52,572 --> 00:19:56,639
– It’s not possible unless and until you are Sthitha Pragya,

211
00:19:56,858 --> 00:19:58,834
unless and until you are enlightened.

212
00:19:58,934 --> 00:20:03,064
Now, when you are enlightened,
when you have got your realization,

213
00:20:03,167 --> 00:20:07,524
when you raise your Kundalini or anybody’s Kundalini,

214
00:20:07,862 --> 00:20:13,477
you don’t say ” Mother, I am giving realization “.
You don’t say that, never.

215
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:18,675
What you say: ” It is happening “, in third person you talk. ”

216
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:23,519
It’s not coming, it’s not working or it’s just moving on the side.

217
00:20:23,636 --> 00:20:26,254
This chakra is catching, that chakra is catching.

218
00:20:26,414 --> 00:20:30,719
” You never say ” I am doing anything “, the ‘I’ is lost.

219
00:20:32,862 --> 00:20:40,887
When that ‘I’ is lost, than only
you will put everything at the lotus feet of God.

220
00:20:41,364 --> 00:20:43,964
So, first, it should be done in Dharma.

221
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:47,752
Supposing, somebody murders somebody and say ” Oh, I have

222
00:20:47,931 --> 00:20:52,157
done it now, so it is my karmas
and I put it at the lotus feet of Shri Krishna. ”

223
00:20:52,534 --> 00:20:56,334
Now, people can, I mean, people have special brains also

224
00:20:57,058 --> 00:21:00,222
to interprete Shri Krishna and Gita.

225
00:21:01,353 --> 00:21:04,170
But what He said for Dharma you should do it.

226
00:21:04,745 --> 00:21:10,012
So, first of all, you should be
a Sthitha Pragya, means an enlightened person,

227
00:21:10,182 --> 00:21:12,177
and whatever you do

228
00:21:12,436 --> 00:21:16,436
automatically goes at the lotus feet of God, automatically,

229
00:21:16,702 --> 00:21:18,864
spontaneously, Sahaj.

230
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:25,144
Now, the third thing He did:

231
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:28,933
What about bhakti? People said ” What?

232
00:21:29,092 --> 00:21:34,292
We are doing bhakti to God, this,
that, then what is the reward for this? ”

233
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:36,384
There again He plays tricks.

234
00:21:37,367 --> 00:21:40,767
On one word He has made everybody dance, you know?

235
00:21:42,307 --> 00:21:47,316
He says ” You do bhakti, but it should be Ananya, ”

236
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:51,800
– this is the word, Ananya, – when there is not the other,

237
00:21:52,317 --> 00:21:56,225
means when you have become One with Me,

238
00:21:56,721 --> 00:22:00,921
means you are a Sthitha Pragya, means you are a realized soul.

239
00:22:03,606 --> 00:22:08,023
Just imagine, on this word if people pay attention,

240
00:22:08,261 --> 00:22:11,328
they will give up all this nonsense of bhakti

241
00:22:11,693 --> 00:22:17,546
and will first get their connection when they become Ananya

242
00:22:17,705 --> 00:22:19,305
and then do the bhakti.

243
00:22:21,178 --> 00:22:24,511
Because Shri Krishna knew human beings very well.

244
00:22:24,948 --> 00:22:29,115
I think, He knew them better than Christ
– definitely

245
00:22:30,317 --> 00:22:33,349
– because Christ was straightforward.

246
00:22:33,548 --> 00:22:36,445
He said: ” Take out your right eye, throw it away.

247
00:22:36,584 --> 00:22:39,004
Take out your left eye, throw it away.

248
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:41,057
Cut your hand, throw it away.

249
00:22:41,386 --> 00:22:44,452
” Same with Mohammed Sahib. Who will do that?

250
00:22:45,969 --> 00:22:50,730
So, Shri Krishna was very clever, He said:

251
00:22:50,929 --> 00:22:53,729
straightforward they will not understand,

252
00:22:53,881 --> 00:22:58,563
so give them in such a way that they will go on doing and doing,

253
00:22:58,699 --> 00:23:02,591
we are doing so much bhakti, so many people come into it.
Even this Ram,

254
00:23:02,789 --> 00:23:06,598
Hari Ramas, they are developing now throat cancers.

255
00:23:06,877 --> 00:23:10,587
So, they are saying ” Mother, why these throat cancer to us,

256
00:23:10,726 --> 00:23:15,593
we are saying the name of Sri Krishna?”
” Because you are not connected.”

257
00:23:16,688 --> 00:23:21,799
Now supposing, I will even want to
meet the president of this country.

258
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:26,878
I’ll have to go through such a protocol. I may not even meet.

259
00:23:29,815 --> 00:23:33,902
But this One is the God of Gods.

260
00:23:35,271 --> 00:23:38,138
He is the President of all the presidents.

261
00:23:39,991 --> 00:23:44,940
If you have to take His name, if you go and take name of Lincoln,

262
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:50,506
of Clinton, and go on saying
” Clinton, Clinton Clinton “, they’ll all arrest Me.

263
00:23:51,468 --> 00:23:57,876
So, if you go on saying ” Rama, Rama, Rama,
Allah, Allah, Allah, Akbar, Akbar, Akbar “, you’ll be arrested.

264
00:23:58,036 --> 00:23:59,636
You have no connection.

265
00:24:02,183 --> 00:24:04,716
So, that Virata Shakti which we call,

266
00:24:06,563 --> 00:24:10,194
which is of course in Koran described as Akbar,

267
00:24:12,734 --> 00:24:16,940
this power also plays tricks.

268
00:24:23,766 --> 00:24:27,198
As a Mother, I have to warn you

269
00:24:29,145 --> 00:24:36,160
that nothing will work out
unless (and) until you are a realized soul.

270
00:24:36,974 --> 00:24:41,537
Nothing will work out. Now, for realization,

271
00:24:42,411 --> 00:24:44,878
He has said: ” You have to become “.

272
00:24:45,268 --> 00:24:48,601
But He didn’t say at that time

273
00:24:49,474 --> 00:24:54,025
how you will become, what will work it out.

274
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:58,990
Because you see, sort of, if you go to college,

275
00:24:59,139 --> 00:25:02,205
all the knowledge is not given in first year.

276
00:25:02,358 --> 00:25:04,957
Something is given, then something in second year,

277
00:25:05,096 --> 00:25:09,763
then in third year. Now in the seventh year,
now Sahaja Yoga has come

278
00:25:09,958 --> 00:25:12,517
to tell you everything, totally.

279
00:25:14,204 --> 00:25:19,815
He is Totality, but He doesn’t give total knowledge.

280
00:25:20,847 --> 00:25:23,447
The whole knowledge of Gita is nothing

281
00:25:23,702 --> 00:25:27,969
but trick that He has played with human beings who were stupid,

282
00:25:28,147 --> 00:25:30,271
and would never have understood Him

283
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:33,004
 if He’d told them about Sahaja Yoga.

284
00:25:33,149 --> 00:25:36,149
Even today I meet many like that, of course,

285
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:41,260
but so many He could not have got at that time.

286
00:25:42,015 --> 00:25:47,689
So, they didn’t talk about Kundalini this much, so far,

287
00:25:48,126 --> 00:25:49,752
and that’s all.

288
00:25:53,344 --> 00:25:55,736
Same with other people.

289
00:25:56,053 --> 00:26:00,906
The kind of disciples they had, the kind of people they had,

290
00:26:01,066 --> 00:26:06,911
they could not tell them everything about

291
00:26:07,328 --> 00:26:12,049
their ascent, because they were not ready,

292
00:26:12,288 --> 00:26:16,688
they were not of that level, their brains were not that developed.

293
00:26:16,971 --> 00:26:20,628
Now in this Kali Yuga, when I am starting this work,

294
00:26:20,867 --> 00:26:24,398
I find their brains are overdeveloped, over.

295
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:30,807
And so much so that overdeveloped brains become stupid

296
00:26:30,998 --> 00:26:36,382
and that’s really. Overuse of anything makes you stupid,

297
00:26:37,613 --> 00:26:41,176
and they become absolutely stupid.

298
00:26:42,605 --> 00:26:46,168
Now, how can you tell them such a subtle knowledge

299
00:26:46,486 --> 00:26:51,069
who are stupid people? What is the way?

300
00:26:52,042 --> 00:26:55,097
If I talk like Shri Krishna

301
00:26:55,672 --> 00:26:59,176
it would have been just a waste of My energy

302
00:26:59,395 --> 00:27:03,261
and your energy. Half of you would have gone off to sleep.

303
00:27:03,522 --> 00:27:08,164
So I said, first of all, let Me connect them to Divinity.

304
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:13,120
If I could connect them to Divinity – little bit even, little bit

305
00:27:13,323 --> 00:27:15,257
– then they will understand.

306
00:27:15,486 --> 00:27:19,086
Because that will enlighten their brain a little bit,

307
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:23,282
and they will know that there’s something more than what we know.

308
00:27:23,719 --> 00:27:26,319
And that’s how it is going to work out.

309
00:27:26,814 --> 00:27:31,082
So the subtle system of trickery of Shri Krishna

310
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,296
has helped a lot, no doubt, that people are realizing

311
00:27:34,515 --> 00:27:39,847
that there is something missing in it. Even of Islam

312
00:27:41,256 --> 00:27:47,565
– Islam means surrender – but surrender to whom? To mullahs

313
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:56,813
– or to whom? The problem started when
[Hijak, a name – UNCLEAR] he started like that.

314
00:27:57,031 --> 00:27:59,602
There are mullahs and there are this.

315
00:27:59,781 --> 00:28:02,134
So, the surrender part became

316
00:28:02,254 --> 00:28:07,787
surrender to these stupid mullahs.
I’ve seen most of them are absolutely stupid.

317
00:28:08,463 --> 00:28:11,811
And they take a cane in their hands in the other, you see

318
00:28:11,974 --> 00:28:14,174
they beat, even women they beat.

319
00:28:14,331 --> 00:28:16,832
You are supposed to do Pujas five times

320
00:28:16,951 --> 00:28:20,780
and if you don’t do them, Pujas five times,
they call it silla [UNCLEAR],

321
00:28:20,939 --> 00:28:25,951
then they beat women. Every shop must be closed five times.

322
00:28:27,558 --> 00:28:32,201
I tell you, they are such hypocritical people naturally,

323
00:28:33,173 --> 00:28:37,107
because if you are asked to do five times meditation, say,

324
00:28:37,796 --> 00:28:40,930
you will never do it, but you will just do it out of fear.

325
00:28:41,098 --> 00:28:44,298
Out of fear if you do something, what’s the use?

326
00:28:46,122 --> 00:28:49,922
Now, whatever Muhammed Sahib has said or Christ has said,

327
00:28:50,686 --> 00:28:55,983
it is only for angels, I can tell you, not for normal people.

328
00:28:57,293 --> 00:29:03,146
And where are the angels? Very few there are:

329
00:29:03,661 --> 00:29:07,595
those are born-realized people who have come on this earth

330
00:29:07,756 --> 00:29:15,275
are angels. And they are told not to do something they will not do.

331
00:29:15,811 --> 00:29:19,474
Most of them know what is right and wrong.

332
00:29:19,677 --> 00:29:21,944
Where are those angels, very few?

333
00:29:23,165 --> 00:29:28,065
And those who are angels are treated just like, you can call it,

334
00:29:29,453 --> 00:29:33,929
like packed people or lunatic people, – nobody believes them.

335
00:29:34,426 --> 00:29:38,850
One here and one there and one in some other place.

336
00:29:39,545 --> 00:29:44,981
So this, what they preached was for the angels.

337
00:29:45,556 --> 00:29:47,823
Only the angels could understand.

338
00:29:48,041 --> 00:29:52,035
But Shri Krishna thought that these other people who are there,

339
00:29:52,169 --> 00:29:54,836
who are not angels, why not trick them?

340
00:29:56,395 --> 00:30:01,795
Many people come and tell me: ”
We take the name of Krishna every day like this,

341
00:30:01,932 --> 00:30:04,198
and we haven’t received anything.

342
00:30:04,967 --> 00:30:08,700
” But first He said, ” You have to be Sthitha Pragya. ”

343
00:30:09,014 --> 00:30:14,341
Sthitha Pragya: ‘Sthitha’ means established,

344
00:30:15,075 --> 00:30:17,952
‘Pragya’ means enlightened,

345
00:30:18,944 --> 00:30:25,868
– you should be enlightened personality, absolutely established.

346
00:30:26,556 --> 00:30:30,156
First thing, first thing you see, in a second chapter.

347
00:30:30,504 --> 00:30:35,325
First thing is it. After that He says all these things,

348
00:30:35,881 --> 00:30:41,357
and that’s why many people have misunderstood Gita.

349
00:30:41,953 --> 00:30:45,486
But His idea was: in one life they’ll misunderstand,

350
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,053
second life they’ll misunderstand,

351
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:52,230
third life they will start thinking ” After all, what is this?”

352
00:30:52,369 --> 00:30:56,853
First, He has said “You become a Sthitha Pragya”,
we have not become a Sthitha Pragya.

353
00:30:57,071 --> 00:30:58,938
So, what’s wrong with us? ”

354
00:30:59,829 --> 00:31:02,163
So, some introspection will start.

355
00:31:02,607 --> 00:31:05,860
That was His idea, idea I should say.

356
00:31:06,493 --> 00:31:12,981
But I have seen people
who can give lectures on Gita hours together,

357
00:31:13,299 --> 00:31:17,366
but their brains are closed completely.

358
00:31:19,569 --> 00:31:23,969
Now, to say that He didn’t say anything about Kundalini is there.

359
00:31:24,489 --> 00:31:30,393
That’s why Gyaneshwara in
the twelvth century took permission from his brother

360
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:35,537
who was his guru that ”Allow me, at least, to say about Kundalini.”

361
00:31:36,465 --> 00:31:39,465
And that is how it was exposed a little bit.

362
00:31:40,381 --> 00:31:42,635
Of course, before that also,

363
00:31:43,031 --> 00:31:49,342
we have had people like Adi Shankaracharya, the sixth century,

364
00:31:49,838 --> 00:31:53,524
and before that also Markandeya.

365
00:31:54,395 --> 00:32:00,905
But they talked about the Kundalini,
that’s all, praised the Kundalini.

366
00:32:01,898 --> 00:32:06,898
But that She passes through six centers,
how will It raise and all that.

367
00:32:07,433 --> 00:32:11,233
And not about the future, that this will happen one day.

368
00:32:11,932 --> 00:32:14,132
So many have written, of course.

369
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:19,699
But I would say that precisely the one who has written

370
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:25,354
complete description of Sahaja Yogis even is by Gyaneshwara

371
00:32:25,612 --> 00:32:32,298
in the poetry called Pasaydan in which
he exactly said what will happen,

372
00:32:32,914 --> 00:32:36,941
how many people will get realization

373
00:32:37,358 --> 00:32:39,691
and he said that ” You the people,

374
00:32:40,681 --> 00:32:54,113
who are the forests of the trees,
boon-giving trees, Kalpakaruna, boon-giving trees,

375
00:32:54,669 --> 00:32:59,172
you rise and give it to others.

376
00:32:59,461 --> 00:33:06,679
” Then he says that ” You are the oceans who are

377
00:33:07,994 --> 00:33:11,084
giving ambrosia talks.”

378
00:33:11,958 --> 00:33:15,158
He has described you in such a beautiful manner

379
00:33:16,085 --> 00:33:19,351
that you should read the translation of Pasaydan

380
00:33:19,755 --> 00:33:22,222
and then you will know what you are,

381
00:33:22,493 --> 00:33:28,293
how you have been praised by him.
And he said that you will loose other relationship

382
00:33:28,524 --> 00:33:31,324
and the only relationships will be these.

383
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:34,774
They will be your real relations.

384
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:38,490
To say all these things, to have such a vision,

385
00:33:38,631 --> 00:33:42,234
he must be a great incarnation himself.

386
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:52,997
So, this is how in Gyaneshwari, which is a commentary of Gita,

387
00:33:53,155 --> 00:33:57,289
he has put in the sixth chapter, now is a commentary on Gita,

388
00:33:57,462 --> 00:34:01,928
but in the sixth chapter he said how you can get your realization.

389
00:34:02,859 --> 00:34:05,459
About Kundalini, how it will work out.

390
00:34:05,716 --> 00:34:08,847
So, gradually it was all unfolded.

391
00:34:09,304 --> 00:34:12,240
And gradually people also developed

392
00:34:12,439 --> 00:34:14,839
their spiritual state to understand.

393
00:34:15,157 --> 00:34:19,290
Supposing, I had started Sahaja Yoga even hundred years back,

394
00:34:19,502 --> 00:34:23,969
I would not have even one single disciple, one single Sahaja Yogi.

395
00:34:24,205 --> 00:34:28,728
The reason was, the people were all right,
they were on value system, all right.

396
00:34:28,847 --> 00:34:32,726
Their life was very much satisfying, they were very peaceful.

397
00:34:32,846 --> 00:34:36,536
They were just interested in some horses or something like that.

398
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:42,012
But now, you find people are so much disturbed,

399
00:34:42,191 --> 00:34:46,457
so much in trouble, so much in chaos this in Kali Yuga,

400
00:34:46,695 --> 00:34:50,703
it’s the height of Kali Yuga now. So much of immorality,

401
00:34:51,001 --> 00:34:54,988
so much of dissatisfaction in life

402
00:34:55,229 --> 00:34:59,455
that they have to now think where to go.

403
00:35:00,229 --> 00:35:04,078
Like a shock the future is waiting for them

404
00:35:04,265 --> 00:35:07,798
and now what should they achieve. So, the whole this

405
00:35:09,394 --> 00:35:17,501
Bhranti, illusion of life starts staring at them,

406
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,509
and then they start thinking ” What is this, what am I doing,

407
00:35:21,707 --> 00:35:24,327
what have I done, why is it so?

408
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:28,176
Why everything in a chaos, why is it happening? ”

409
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:33,605
Then the seeking starts and with their seeking now,
you know what has happened,

410
00:35:33,743 --> 00:35:36,163
that you all have got your realization.

411
00:35:36,304 --> 00:35:41,085
Without the seeking it would not
have been even possible for Me to talk to you

412
00:35:41,263 --> 00:35:43,426
at all about Sahaja Yoga.

413
00:35:43,584 --> 00:35:46,263
It is because you are seekers I can talk to you.

414
00:35:46,402 --> 00:35:48,457
And it has worked out,

415
00:35:48,577 --> 00:35:51,911
I am very happy that it has worked out in America.

416
00:35:53,287 --> 00:35:58,386
Another quality, is a great quality of Shri Krishna, is that

417
00:35:58,664 --> 00:36:03,815
He is Gujara [HINDI ?], means

418
00:36:04,689 --> 00:36:08,637
His element is firmament, what we call Akash,

419
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:12,645
and He penetrates into everything.

420
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:20,686
He penetrates into everything. He penetrates into the

421
00:36:21,987 --> 00:36:28,464
– what do you call that – anu, renu, paramanu,

422
00:36:28,643 --> 00:36:38,305
three things – atoms. Into little atoms it goes and it shakes them.

423
00:36:38,901 --> 00:36:41,967
Now, if you ask any scientist, he’ll tell you

424
00:36:42,175 --> 00:36:48,753
that there is an asymetric, symetric vibrations even in atoms.

425
00:36:49,289 --> 00:36:53,696
Now, how can this energy be existing there?

426
00:36:53,915 --> 00:36:57,089
Because He can penetrate into anything

427
00:36:57,347 --> 00:37:01,315
and because of this, He’s so penetrating,

428
00:37:01,832 --> 00:37:05,998
that He encompasses everything:

429
00:37:06,435 --> 00:37:14,992
into matter, into animals, into human beings, into realized souls

430
00:37:15,476 --> 00:37:21,738
He penetrates. In the matter it is just a vibrations,

431
00:37:22,186 --> 00:37:25,142
in the animals it is just a guiding force,

432
00:37:25,298 --> 00:37:27,364
 it’s tremendous guiding force.

433
00:37:33,131 --> 00:37:38,754
Like birds from Siberia flying down to Australia:

434
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:42,525
who gives them the sense of direction?

435
00:37:43,179 --> 00:37:45,192
We never think about it.

436
00:37:48,129 --> 00:37:52,791
There are so many things animals are doing.

437
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:56,482
They have such a sense of understanding.

438
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:00,867
Like a tiger in the, say, in the forest:

439
00:38:01,304 --> 00:38:04,676
all the animals know that there is a tiger in the forest,

440
00:38:04,836 --> 00:38:07,702
they are all quiet, respecting their king.

441
00:38:08,277 --> 00:38:13,555
He kills, say one cow or could be some animal,

442
00:38:13,853 --> 00:38:19,487
they just respect him. The thing what he has killed is left

443
00:38:19,984 --> 00:38:22,840
for one day, nobody touches it.

444
00:38:23,535 --> 00:38:27,781
See the protocol: now when he comes back next day,

445
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,436
he eats to his own satisfaction,

446
00:38:31,032 --> 00:38:34,165
then the tigress, then the children, they eat.

447
00:38:34,742 --> 00:38:40,734
Once they have finished with it,
then one by one, in the order of protocol,

448
00:38:41,211 --> 00:38:45,258
all the animals eat that animal,

449
00:38:45,754 --> 00:38:49,107
the last of all are crows

450
00:38:50,417 --> 00:38:54,849
which are perhaps vegetarians, I should say.

451
00:38:55,130 --> 00:39:01,357
But the protocol is maintained.

452
00:39:02,032 --> 00:39:07,805
If a lion is sitting,

453
00:39:08,302 --> 00:39:14,036
you can make it out there won’t be even a little sound anywhere.

454
00:39:16,677 --> 00:39:22,848
So, it guides the animals and animals keep their character.

455
00:39:23,818 --> 00:39:25,952
They are not like human beings.

456
00:39:26,112 --> 00:39:30,774
For example, a snake is a snake and a tiger is a tiger.

457
00:39:31,211 --> 00:39:34,782
But human beings can be snake, tiger, leopard

458
00:39:34,961 --> 00:39:36,568
– anything together.

459
00:39:37,759 --> 00:39:43,092
They might be dogs, they might be
small little worms, they could be anything.

460
00:39:44,009 --> 00:39:46,142
Combinations of so many things,

461
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:50,734
because they have passed through
these Yonis, as they call them, these species.

462
00:39:51,350 --> 00:40:00,198
So, all these kinds of combinations, permutations,
combinations inside of the past is existing.

463
00:40:01,091 --> 00:40:05,824
And if somebody can take you to your subconscious,
I have seen this,

464
00:40:06,052 --> 00:40:08,252
people start barking like a dog,

465
00:40:08,949 --> 00:40:16,312
and sometimes they behave like tigers, this can happen.

466
00:40:17,007 --> 00:40:19,705
All this is within us, the past,

467
00:40:20,123 --> 00:40:23,971
with all these complicated personalities.

468
00:40:24,968 --> 00:40:32,535
Some are like owls, always very serious, you know, hawk-like,

469
00:40:32,932 --> 00:40:36,066
some are like chirping birds.

470
00:40:36,821 --> 00:40:40,421
But there are so many combinations they have in them,

471
00:40:41,265 --> 00:40:44,459
that it is very difficult, you know,

472
00:40:45,412 --> 00:40:49,525
to make them little straightforward.

473
00:40:51,252 --> 00:40:55,652
They are so much entangled. First to remove all the entanglement.

474
00:40:57,283 --> 00:40:59,973
And then to raise the Kundalini.

475
00:41:00,371 --> 00:41:03,904
The best part of the organization is, which is made,

476
00:41:05,331 --> 00:41:09,676
that consciousness is vertically placed.

477
00:41:10,152 --> 00:41:13,366
Subconscious and Supraconscious sort.

478
00:41:13,585 --> 00:41:16,118
Supraconscious righthandside of yours

479
00:41:16,303 --> 00:41:19,237
and the Subconscious lefthandside of yours.

480
00:41:21,075 --> 00:41:25,542
And in the central the path is left on. This is the Sushumna path.

481
00:41:26,353 --> 00:41:28,353
It is the Mahalakshmi’s path.

482
00:41:28,734 --> 00:41:34,242
It is the path, which leads you to the state of Virat,

483
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:36,264
to the state of your brain.

484
00:41:39,838 --> 00:41:45,095
So now, the combination of three things work out.

485
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:50,770
The brain is the Virat, heart is Shiva,

486
00:41:51,465 --> 00:41:56,639
and the liver is Brahmadeva.

487
00:41:57,057 --> 00:42:00,290
All these three powers are there.

488
00:42:05,092 --> 00:42:08,445
But at that time, when you are realized,

489
00:42:08,803 --> 00:42:13,227
then your brain surrenders to Shiva,

490
00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:17,673
to the principle of Shiva, that is the Spirit.

491
00:42:18,343 --> 00:42:23,844
Brain is surrendered, surrendered not by force or anything,

492
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:29,471
but to absorb the power of the Spirit,

493
00:42:29,669 --> 00:42:34,332
the brain gets surrendered completely to the Spirit,

494
00:42:35,146 --> 00:42:37,879
so that the Spirit enlightens the brain.

495
00:42:39,372 --> 00:42:43,062
It is the enlightenment of the brain

496
00:42:43,816 --> 00:42:50,531
that gives you all this subtle understanding.

497
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:54,955
It is to make your brain understand,

498
00:42:55,551 --> 00:43:00,729
there are so many blissful happenings, people are blessed:

499
00:43:01,067 --> 00:43:07,515
once, twice, thrice – then they are surprised,
the brain starts thinking.

500
00:43:07,971 --> 00:43:11,206
”How did I get this blessing, how did it happen to me,

501
00:43:11,385 --> 00:43:18,269
how could I get my transformation?” So slowly-slowly

502
00:43:18,548 --> 00:43:23,944
they start trusting their heart,
means they start trusting their Spirit,

503
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:29,500
they start trusting their devotion.

504
00:43:31,246 --> 00:43:37,587
And this is how the bhakti is absolutely

505
00:43:38,123 --> 00:43:43,202
done without any desire, without any asking,

506
00:43:43,381 --> 00:43:46,932
without any obligation, just in oneness.

507
00:43:47,091 --> 00:43:53,420
Because the brain joins hands with the heart, we can say.

508
00:43:54,331 --> 00:44:00,878
Now, also the Brahmadeva becomes surrendered.

509
00:44:02,188 --> 00:44:08,390
As a result, what happens:
that your liver is surrendered to your brain.

510
00:44:11,901 --> 00:44:17,805
When this happens – when your liver is surrendered to your brain

511
00:44:18,045 --> 00:44:22,370
– whatever you do is all enlightened work.

512
00:44:23,322 --> 00:44:26,952
Whatever you do: whether you sing,

513
00:44:27,151 --> 00:44:30,344
whether you’re a government servant, whether anything

514
00:44:30,505 --> 00:44:33,837
– whatever you do with your brain, anything

515
00:44:33,976 --> 00:44:36,158
through the Swadishthana

516
00:44:36,337 --> 00:44:41,095
or through the Brahmadeva, it is an enlightened work.

1
00:44:41,241 --> 00:44:44,653
As it is the brain which is enlightened,

2
00:44:45,321 --> 00:44:48,654
which is connected with this All Pervading Power,

3
00:44:48,991 --> 00:44:55,122
whatever you are doing, whatever your ideas are,

4
00:44:55,559 --> 00:45:03,237
being absolutely enlightened means that you achieve them.

5
00:45:05,804 --> 00:45:09,653
Enlightened brain, whatever it thinks,

6
00:45:10,229 --> 00:45:14,669
it is thinking as well as achieving – both together.

7
00:45:16,577 --> 00:45:22,985
It’s a thing to be understood that an enlightened person

8
00:45:24,295 --> 00:45:28,955
has the power to achieve anything.

9
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:35,573
But at the same time his desires would be Divine.

10
00:45:36,783 --> 00:45:41,346
Like the other day we had very few people say in Saritos,

11
00:45:42,002 --> 00:45:46,466
so all the Sahaja Yogis were extremely unhappy

12
00:45:47,081 --> 00:45:51,148
as if somebody has died in their family and worse than that.

13
00:45:52,379 --> 00:45:57,678
Why? Because this was their own work,

14
00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:05,237
which they could not understand why this enlightened mind of theirs

15
00:46:05,575 --> 00:46:08,975
could not produce the result, achieve the results.

16
00:46:10,833 --> 00:46:13,033
And they felt extremely unhappy.

17
00:46:13,492 --> 00:46:21,159
This shows what identification there is for the spiritual work,

18
00:46:21,675 --> 00:46:24,949
or Divine work and their own lives.

19
00:46:25,147 --> 00:46:27,547
To them this is the most important.

20
00:46:27,687 --> 00:46:30,425
And everybody is not like that, of course.

21
00:46:30,564 --> 00:46:33,699
For some people, something else is more important.

22
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:38,798
They may use Sahaja Yoga for their own well-being or anything.

23
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:41,763
But those who just think of Sahaja Yoga

24
00:46:43,121 --> 00:46:47,387
– that’s again the brain which is enlightened. They achieve it.

25
00:46:48,577 --> 00:46:52,110
But it should not have any selfish motive behind it.

26
00:46:52,506 --> 00:46:57,961
It should not have any hatred behind it or anything,

27
00:46:59,965 --> 00:47:03,658
or for some sort of a publicity or some.

28
00:47:04,928 --> 00:47:12,058
But if it is just the thinking about the Sahaja Yoga work,

29
00:47:12,199 --> 00:47:14,837
it will be achieved, it will be achieved.

30
00:47:14,996 --> 00:47:17,263
One should never feel frustrated.

31
00:47:17,655 --> 00:47:20,522
That’s what is said, that God is with you,

32
00:47:21,246 --> 00:47:23,091
He is your shepherd.

33
00:47:23,329 --> 00:47:27,774
And this is what happens when you become

34
00:47:28,389 --> 00:47:35,858
a surrendered lamb under the guide of this shepherd.

35
00:47:39,252 --> 00:47:46,096
Then as a result of this brain becoming enlightened,
you start having faith in yourself.

36
00:47:49,033 --> 00:47:51,833
Nirvikalpa, you become doubtlessly aware.

37
00:47:52,168 --> 00:47:56,101
As soon as you become, I mean the brain becomes doubtless.

38
00:47:56,228 --> 00:48:00,049
It’s the brain that thinks,
it’s the brain that doubts, it’s the brain

39
00:48:00,148 --> 00:48:04,082
that creates all conditionings, the brain that creates ego

40
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:10,386
– one instrument doing all this nonsense. Hatred it will create,

41
00:48:10,525 --> 00:48:16,556
it will justify nonsense, it will criticize others,

42
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:22,221
it will hate others, it will make fun of others.

43
00:48:23,749 --> 00:48:26,483
That is not the quality of Shri Krishna,

44
00:48:27,638 --> 00:48:30,574
because He is the collective.

45
00:48:34,166 --> 00:48:38,833
That’s why He never said: ” You are a sinner ”
or anything like that.

46
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:44,103
He didn’t criticize anyone.

47
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:50,531
After all, I have to criticize, He did not.

48
00:48:50,948 --> 00:48:54,682
Now, if there was Kamsa, all right, kill him, finished.

49
00:48:54,798 --> 00:48:56,598
There are Sanda, kill him.

50
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:00,591
Any rakshasa, Narakasura, kill him,

51
00:49:01,008 --> 00:49:05,685
finished, no argument., nothing.
”I have no time for this nonsense. Finish him.”

52
00:49:06,499 --> 00:49:08,792
Straightforward.

53
00:49:09,566 --> 00:49:12,166
What is the use of criticizing anyone,

54
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:18,752
just kill them. That was as straightforward.

55
00:49:19,209 --> 00:49:23,276
But by killing them, they again come back in this Kali Yuga.

56
00:49:26,114 --> 00:49:30,369
So the best thing is to detach people from him,

57
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:34,556
from these rakshasas where they are lost.

58
00:49:34,874 --> 00:49:41,242
That’s the best way. Now,
one way could be that I put it in your brains

59
00:49:41,699 --> 00:49:48,108
that this is a rakshas. But they won’t believe Me, they won’t.

60
00:49:48,803 --> 00:49:51,960
So, what happens when you go to them,

61
00:49:52,218 --> 00:49:56,722
you get all the kinks in your head.

62
00:49:57,258 --> 00:50:00,925
You start getting pins and needles on your fingertips.

63
00:50:01,405 --> 00:50:05,868
This is all the activity of brain that it acts on your nerves,

64
00:50:06,146 --> 00:50:07,447
and you can feel it.

65
00:50:07,634 --> 00:50:12,706
You start shaking. The other day somebody came and sat before
Me for news just doing like this. ” What is this – Stop it! ”

66
00:50:12,864 --> 00:50:18,233
 ” So I can’t, I can’t, I can’t “, he was going on.
I wasn’t doing anything to him, it’s the brain.

67
00:50:19,802 --> 00:50:24,642
In My presence, the brain acts.

68
00:50:25,528 --> 00:50:28,994
Because as I told you, He penetrates into anything,

69
00:50:29,139 --> 00:50:31,205
if I put my glance at somebody.

70
00:50:32,809 --> 00:50:34,170
The other day,

71
00:50:34,349 --> 00:50:39,944
there was a boy, very naughty, beats people,
he bites them, these things like that, very crazy.

72
00:50:40,242 --> 00:50:42,309
As soon as he saw Me ran away.

73
00:50:43,298 --> 00:50:46,031
He attacks every person but he ran away.

74
00:50:46,491 --> 00:50:50,420
Then you have seen people who are possessed, what happens to them?

75
00:50:50,584 --> 00:50:53,584
Just like this, they come to Me, they shake,

76
00:50:53,764 --> 00:50:56,879
they – sometimes I only worry that they should not faint

77
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:00,988
in My presence in the programme, otherwise it’s a headache.

78
00:51:02,278 --> 00:51:07,833
So, who acts in them, who acts on these people who are possessed,

79
00:51:08,050 --> 00:51:11,050
who makes all these gestures – is the brain.

80
00:51:12,158 --> 00:51:14,987
In the brain they have got

81
00:51:15,623 --> 00:51:18,890
these problems and Shri Krishna makes them shake.

82
00:51:21,077 --> 00:51:25,770
It’s the tremors that they feel,
the pins and needles that they feel,

83
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:30,810
the heat that they feel – all this is central nervous system,

84
00:51:31,843 --> 00:51:33,310
run by brain.

85
00:51:34,263 --> 00:51:42,755
So, after enlightenment, what happens that the brain is at peace,

86
00:51:44,167 --> 00:51:47,003
absolutely at peace with itself.

87
00:51:47,617 --> 00:51:53,122
It doesn’t react as it used to react.

88
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:58,729
Like I’ve seen people here so speedy, so nervous,

89
00:51:59,483 --> 00:52:03,035
so upset all the time, so jittery, irritable.

90
00:52:03,353 --> 00:52:06,400
I was reading the life of Mao and I was surprised:

91
00:52:06,579 --> 00:52:10,289
his physician, personal physician has said even.

92
00:52:10,507 --> 00:52:16,578
Absolutely like a tyrant and he
used to keep up the faces very well.

93
00:52:16,857 --> 00:52:22,729
But according to this doctor, he was a cruelest man he had known.

94
00:52:23,662 --> 00:52:25,051
This is Mao,

95
00:52:26,718 --> 00:52:33,051
who obviously looked to be a very great reformer,
he did so much for that country, this thing.

96
00:52:33,702 --> 00:52:37,849
But no, he was a hypocrite. How will you know

97
00:52:38,206 --> 00:52:42,035
somebody is a hypocrite or not – with your brain?

98
00:52:42,333 --> 00:52:44,200
Only if you are enlightened.

99
00:52:45,309 --> 00:52:49,714
So, if Shri Krishna penetrates into your brain,

100
00:52:49,992 --> 00:52:54,793
then you become an enlightened person, Sthitha Pragya,

101
00:52:55,012 --> 00:53:00,368
and you become knowledgeable, you know everything,

102
00:53:02,393 --> 00:53:04,388
whatever is necessary.

103
00:53:04,865 --> 00:53:10,499
You may not know who is number one Wimbledon, maybe.

104
00:53:11,512 --> 00:53:16,045
You may not know who is the actress, what is her life, you may not.

105
00:53:17,008 --> 00:53:21,741
You may not know who is the president
of such and such place, maybe.

106
00:53:23,535 --> 00:53:28,972
But you will know whatever is necessary for you to know.

107
00:53:29,646 --> 00:53:32,246
Otherwise people waste their energies.

108
00:53:32,485 --> 00:53:39,032
I know of somebody who knew the telephone numbers

109
00:53:39,747 --> 00:53:48,139
and the car numbers of two thousand people. What is the need?

110
00:53:50,858 --> 00:53:59,113
Something like that,
all these stupid things is a waste of mental energy.

111
00:53:59,723 --> 00:54:04,192
But a Sthitha Pragya does not, he is concentrated

112
00:54:04,590 --> 00:54:10,502
onto his own knowledge, onto the Divine understanding.

113
00:54:16,256 --> 00:54:26,794
He works really like a computer, and such an efficient computer.

114
00:54:30,049 --> 00:54:33,362
Today I just started talking about Kabira.

115
00:54:33,878 --> 00:54:36,812
Immediately they said ”Mother, vibrations!”

116
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:41,687
Taking the name of Kabira you get vibrations.

117
00:54:44,226 --> 00:54:49,813
But to a normal person nothing, Kabira is nothing, another

118
00:54:50,032 --> 00:54:51,889
romantic fellow.

119
00:54:52,841 --> 00:54:57,308
If they don’t want to understand something, they can say anything.

120
00:54:59,627 --> 00:55:02,360
But only the people who are enlightened,

121
00:55:02,941 --> 00:55:07,027
their nervous system is so charged

122
00:55:08,576 --> 00:55:14,689
that they can feel what is wrong, what is right, they can feel

123
00:55:14,927 --> 00:55:17,943
the Divinity, they can make out

124
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:22,407
who are incarnations and who were not.

125
00:55:24,848 --> 00:55:30,515
You don’t know what has happened to
your nervous system: a new dimension has come.

126
00:55:31,515 --> 00:55:36,178
Absolutely a new dimension in your nervous system has come,

127
00:55:36,377 --> 00:55:43,082
which is manifesting, and this is also
the blessings of Shri Krishna.

128
00:55:44,789 --> 00:55:48,856
Because He is collectiveness within us,

129
00:55:49,392 --> 00:55:54,551
 in the form of collectivity He works.

130
00:55:56,813 --> 00:55:59,746
Unless and until this America is put right,

131
00:56:00,851 --> 00:56:07,140
Shri Krishna is not going to leave my throat, I tell you.

132
00:56:08,311 --> 00:56:18,053
So, as America, I say, is the
place of Shri Krishna’s auspiciousness.

133
00:56:22,330 --> 00:56:27,964
So, one has to understand what is Shri Krishna’s auspiciousness is.

134
00:56:29,017 --> 00:56:31,833
They said He had 16.000 wives,

135
00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:37,805
these were His powers, 16.000 powers He has.

136
00:56:39,056 --> 00:56:42,256
And to work out His incarnation He wanted them.

137
00:56:42,806 --> 00:56:49,330
So, they came on this earth as princesses
and was married by a horrible

138
00:56:49,469 --> 00:56:54,667
king who married them and kept them in the jail.

139
00:56:56,096 --> 00:57:00,896
So, He fought that king and got
them out of them and He married them.

140
00:57:03,041 --> 00:57:08,893
It’s the best part of it: He married them. Because, you see,

141
00:57:09,345 --> 00:57:12,345
with a man, whatever may be his age,

142
00:57:12,604 --> 00:57:16,135
if he has 16.000 women around him,

143
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:20,519
people will never understand that he is Yogeshwara.

144
00:57:20,936 --> 00:57:24,856
Men have this problem. Not the women so much.

145
00:57:25,432 --> 00:57:31,432
Because women become mothers, you see,
I’m a Mother, nobody can challenge my character.

146
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,880
Because I am a Mother. But the fatherhood can be challenged.

147
00:57:38,051 --> 00:57:39,384
So He married them.

148
00:57:39,877 --> 00:57:43,210
Then the essence of the five elements He married,

149
00:57:43,843 --> 00:57:45,489
as five wives.

150
00:57:48,248 --> 00:57:58,636
But His real sense of morality is seen in the case of Draupadi.

151
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:01,764
You know the story of Mahabharata,

152
00:58:02,902 --> 00:58:08,061
when She was brought in the court of Duryodhana

153
00:58:08,696 --> 00:58:12,924
(who) asked Dushasana to take out Her saris.

154
00:58:15,524 --> 00:58:20,147
At that time Tulsidas’s written what happened.

155
00:58:20,564 --> 00:58:26,555
She was holding Her saree by Her teeth.

156
00:58:27,791 --> 00:58:31,191
She called ” Krishna “, She could only say ” Kri “,

157
00:58:31,317 --> 00:58:34,205
‘shna’ means full stop, goes wrong.

158
00:58:34,345 --> 00:58:38,279
She is holding on with only ‘Kri’, and wouldn’t say ‘shna’.

159
00:58:38,730 --> 00:58:43,940
But as soon as She said ” Krishna “, the saree fell down.

160
00:58:44,434 --> 00:58:46,033
Then He describes:

161
00:58:46,233 --> 00:58:49,764
“Dwarika yashoda jayo yashoda bhayo bari

162
00:58:49,923 --> 00:58:53,950
shankha chakra gada padma garuda laisi dhary.”

163
00:58:54,094 --> 00:58:56,034
[Unsure. In Shri Krishna Gitavali of Tulsidas ]

164
00:58:56,214 --> 00:58:57,495
What did He do?

165
00:58:57,773 --> 00:59:05,392
When She just said “Krishna”, there was a big sound in Dwarika,

166
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:07,336
He was in Dwarika.

167
00:59:10,531 --> 00:59:12,388
Immediately,

168
00:59:12,884 --> 00:59:18,499
with “shanka, chakra, gada, padma” – these are His four weapons

169
00:59:19,313 --> 00:59:20,980
– He came on the Garuda.

170
00:59:22,943 --> 00:59:29,106
The way it is said is tremendous,
I mean, I feel really, it fulfils your heart with such

171
00:59:29,444 --> 00:59:35,356
understanding of Shri Krishna. For his own sister,

172
00:59:35,793 --> 00:59:40,951
He came all the way to save Her chastity.

173
00:59:41,646 --> 00:59:47,704
To Him the chastity of His sister was of the greatest importance.

174
00:59:47,823 --> 00:59:50,374
He could have said: ” No, no, no,

175
00:59:50,494 --> 00:59:56,027
I am a king, I have to look after this,
I have to do that, I have to ” – nothing.

176
00:59:56,215 --> 00:59:58,667
 If Her chastity is in danger,

177
00:59:58,826 --> 01:00:03,111
He came flying on the Garuda and supplied that.

178
01:00:03,687 --> 01:00:05,822
And this fellow got tired

179
01:00:05,942 --> 01:00:08,839
pulling out Her saris. I think, he must have borrowed saris from Me

180
01:00:08,998 --> 01:00:12,410
because I have too many saris.

181
01:00:12,985 --> 01:00:15,785
One after the other, one after the other,

182
01:00:15,902 --> 01:00:18,702
he made a pile of saris and he got tired.

183
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:20,666
He could not make Her nude.

184
01:00:22,589 --> 01:00:28,353
The chastity of Draupadi was of such a height.

185
01:00:29,031 --> 01:00:35,615
And how Shri Krishna tried to save it is remarkable.

186
01:00:39,564 --> 01:00:47,381
So, this Yogeshwara Shri Krishna is also a Dhanvantari,

187
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:52,051
means the doctor of doctors.

188
01:00:52,885 --> 01:00:56,952
He is the One who cures. You see, because it’s all the brain

189
01:00:58,163 --> 01:01:01,829
– and the vibrations which flow on the nervous system.

190
01:01:03,738 --> 01:01:10,603
So, He cures people through His brain.

191
01:01:13,150 --> 01:01:21,659
Now, how? Say now, supposing somebody is having a problem, say

192
01:01:22,429 --> 01:01:29,457
on his heart. So as soon as he puts hands to My photograph,

193
01:01:32,017 --> 01:01:38,425
so immediately he gets problem on his left finger here.

194
01:01:38,961 --> 01:01:41,024
The brain is working.

195
01:01:41,719 --> 01:01:48,715
So in your brain, My vibrations go of Shri Krishna

196
01:01:50,303 --> 01:01:55,739
and they start sending these messages.

197
01:01:56,533 --> 01:01:58,667
Because I am also Shri Krishna.

198
01:01:58,925 --> 01:02:01,901
So this computer acts and immediately

199
01:02:02,021 --> 01:02:06,355
you know what’s wrong with that person is, he is a heart patient.

200
01:02:08,807 --> 01:02:12,192
You don’t have to do any diagnosis, you don’t have to do anything.

201
01:02:12,501 --> 01:02:15,813
Immediately you know. And who does this, it’s the

202
01:02:15,954 --> 01:02:19,421
principle of Shri Krishna in the brain of the Virat.

203
01:02:20,921 --> 01:02:25,680
See this, also working for some people, I think.

204
01:02:25,918 --> 01:02:29,237
Now you are convinced about it, you know that it

205
01:02:29,358 --> 01:02:32,492
works, it acts like this, it happens like that,

206
01:02:34,664 --> 01:02:38,954
and how it communicates through you.

207
01:02:39,292 --> 01:02:45,059
So, this computer of Mine communicates.

208
01:02:45,308 --> 01:02:47,562
Now, in a computer if you go,

209
01:02:47,703 --> 01:02:50,634
you can just press the button, of course they are all man-made,

210
01:02:50,754 --> 01:02:53,687
but whatever it is you then get the result.

211
01:02:53,789 --> 01:03:02,818
Here it is not like that. It is the
brain automatically gives the result,

212
01:03:02,975 --> 01:03:06,725
immediately, through the other person.

213
01:03:09,763 --> 01:03:14,861
And also the same brain tells you what is to be done

214
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:18,040
to such and such person, how to work it out.

215
01:03:18,949 --> 01:03:22,302
The same brain is emitting vibrations,

216
01:03:23,275 --> 01:03:28,423
and those vibrations are flowing through this brain,

217
01:03:30,448 --> 01:03:36,340
and they are the ones who tell you what’s wrong with this person.

218
01:03:40,368 --> 01:03:47,607
So, all this work of penetration is done by Shri Krishna, no doubt.

219
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:54,737
He takes these vibrations, puts into another brain,

220
01:03:54,896 --> 01:03:58,884
and then that brain, that central nervous system starts working

221
01:03:59,024 --> 01:04:02,357
and then you get the result. But instantaneously,

222
01:04:03,447 --> 01:04:07,714
it’s not so much time it takes, another way I have described it,

223
01:04:07,879 --> 01:04:09,682
 it just works immediately.

224
01:04:09,822 --> 01:04:13,488
As soon as they put their hands before Me, immediately!

225
01:04:17,555 --> 01:04:24,088
So how important it is for us to look after our brain,
for Sahaja Yogis.

226
01:04:26,737 --> 01:04:32,086
I don’t know in this America how far this brain is safe.

227
01:04:32,503 --> 01:04:36,570
Because if you open any television, wah wah wah,

228
01:04:37,444 --> 01:04:40,142
you look outside on the street,

229
01:04:40,638 --> 01:04:44,050
look out for the – some advertisements

230
01:04:44,428 --> 01:04:46,650
and you hear this music

231
01:04:47,801 --> 01:04:50,134
– it breaks your brain completely.

232
01:04:52,423 --> 01:04:58,037
Whole atmosphere is anti-Shri Krishna.

233
01:05:01,709 --> 01:05:09,823
No purity of understanding, no sense of morality.

234
01:05:10,697 --> 01:05:16,129
The way they make pictures, things, horrible violence, horrible,

235
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:20,733
I should say, immoral scenes, all sorts of things

236
01:05:21,328 --> 01:05:25,336
– all created here in the land of Shri Krishna.

237
01:05:26,705 --> 01:05:36,803
The One who through His waves can completely purify,

238
01:05:36,997 --> 01:05:44,303
because He’s Yogeshwara, because He is detached,

239
01:05:45,574 --> 01:05:50,395
absolutely detached, He cannot get attached to anything.

240
01:05:52,037 --> 01:05:54,370
Only the brain makes you attached.

241
01:05:54,993 --> 01:05:57,660
Now see, supposing this carpet is here.

242
01:05:58,691 --> 01:06:00,358
This is a saree, is here.

243
01:06:01,016 --> 01:06:04,616
I look at the saree, and what a nice is this one now.

244
01:06:05,152 --> 01:06:09,019
Now, if it is mine, I’m worried it should not get spoiled

245
01:06:10,847 --> 01:06:15,171
and where it will be kept, what will happen to it.

246
01:06:16,362 --> 01:06:25,501
Goes on worrying about things. Here is any

247
01:06:25,739 --> 01:06:31,139
more road you walk, there are
shops, shops, shops, shops, shops, shops, shops.

248
01:06:32,188 --> 01:06:38,171
– Attention goes there, and in that attention

249
01:06:38,410 --> 01:06:41,842
this brain gets involved completely.

250
01:06:42,854 --> 01:06:51,346
It gets involved, it wants this, and wants that,
and wants that, and wants that -for what?

251
01:06:52,636 --> 01:06:56,520
So, the detachment from the matter is only possible

252
01:06:58,227 --> 01:06:59,827
if you know generosity.

253
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:08,266
But many people are in Sahaja Yoga, but they are not.

254
01:07:08,862 --> 01:07:11,024
What is generosity now?

255
01:07:12,631 --> 01:07:16,365
Generosity is now if you like My saree, you’ll have it.

256
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:19,818
That’s the real generosity.

257
01:07:22,568 --> 01:07:28,041
Whatever I am buying is for you, supposing. So you have it.

258
01:07:29,748 --> 01:07:34,092
If you have a generous detached temperament,

259
01:07:34,926 --> 01:07:37,926
then you can never get involved with matter.

260
01:07:39,311 --> 01:07:42,663
And whatever you are involved, it is love.

261
01:07:43,338 --> 01:07:47,226
Say, I went to Russia,

262
01:07:48,794 --> 01:07:56,155
and there was nice fish eggs they call as caviar.

263
01:07:57,027 --> 01:08:00,561
There’s one doctor who likes it very much in London.

264
01:08:00,778 --> 01:08:03,311
I said: ” Please, let Me have some “.

265
01:08:03,476 --> 01:08:07,042
They said: ” Why do you want to take this one? ” ” I want to “.

266
01:08:07,201 --> 01:08:09,661
They thought of the doctor who needed it there

267
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:13,034
who likes it very much and I felt very happy about that.

268
01:08:13,153 --> 01:08:15,177
And the doctor also was very happy:

269
01:08:15,316 --> 01:08:19,049
” Mother, you remember even such small thing like this?

270
01:08:22,089 --> 01:08:28,220
So, the matter has a sense of giving
very great joy to another person.

271
01:08:30,276 --> 01:08:34,209
If you do it with love, again, I say: ” Do it with love “,

272
01:08:35,097 --> 01:08:41,744
not with attachment, but with love which is detached.

273
01:08:43,589 --> 01:08:51,855
He’s the One who is detached.

274
01:08:52,827 --> 01:09:00,783
So, what is the love that is detached, I’ve told many a times:

275
01:09:01,016 --> 01:09:06,821
Like the sap in the tree rises, goes to every part of the tree

276
01:09:08,508 --> 01:09:10,708
and is not attached to any part.

277
01:09:12,714 --> 01:09:15,511
And if it gets attached,

278
01:09:16,783 --> 01:09:21,516
then the tree will die, and that fruit,
whatever it is, will die also.

279
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:25,987
So, what is it a detached love is?

280
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:29,827
Detached love is the most beautiful thing.

281
01:09:31,841 --> 01:09:37,339
Firstly, by detached love you know what to give to whom,

282
01:09:38,709 --> 01:09:44,284
what will make people happy, what will make them joyous,

283
01:09:44,701 --> 01:09:46,716
what do they like.

284
01:09:47,173 --> 01:09:50,705
– In love only you know these things, – what do they like,

285
01:09:50,863 --> 01:09:59,296
what is their colour, style, what they want. Little, little things.

286
01:10:01,122 --> 01:10:04,322
As I told you yesterday the story of Shri Rama,

287
01:10:05,725 --> 01:10:12,551
whatever is done with love, even a little thing that you know

288
01:10:13,405 --> 01:10:17,338
you would like, I would like to purchase, may look stupid.

289
01:10:17,790 --> 01:10:20,590
But I know you like it, so I’ll buy that.

290
01:10:22,254 --> 01:10:24,588
In the same way, you also do that.

291
01:10:26,022 --> 01:10:29,825
All the time you think ” Mother, what will She like?”

292
01:10:29,945 --> 01:10:33,011
So, you look for little things here and there.

293
01:10:35,505 --> 01:10:40,060
But this detachment has to be full and complete.

294
01:10:41,112 --> 01:10:45,979
Then only you really get people attached to you,
otherwise you cannot.

295
01:10:46,291 --> 01:10:50,224
If you are not detached, you cannot get

296
01:10:51,362 --> 01:10:54,358
that complete love for another person.

297
01:10:54,636 --> 01:10:58,675
Because if you are doing something, say, for money,

298
01:11:00,799 --> 01:11:03,465
or if you are doing something for lust,

299
01:11:04,549 --> 01:11:10,223
or for greed, or for some sort of a position, it has no meaning.

300
01:11:11,235 --> 01:11:16,168
People know
”Oh, I know why he is doing it, because I am such and such“.

301
01:11:18,092 --> 01:11:22,715
In Sahaja Yoga also many people come either to make money,

302
01:11:22,993 --> 01:11:25,793
either to get cured, all kinds of things.

303
01:11:27,914 --> 01:11:30,195
But if you are detached,

304
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:35,632
then only Sahaja Yoga will spread.

305
01:11:37,418 --> 01:11:43,285
As long as there are attachments,
you should know that you are not yet a Sahaja Yogi.

306
01:11:44,204 --> 01:11:50,604
I am not saying ”You take out your eye or cut your hands”
I didn’t say that, to that extent.

307
01:11:51,466 --> 01:11:55,216
What I’m saying: you should introspect and see:

308
01:11:55,672 --> 01:11:59,220
”How much am I attached to this or to that,

309
01:11:59,419 --> 01:12:04,935
and why am I so much attached, what does it matter?”

310
01:12:05,371 --> 01:12:07,637
Always, as a result of attachment

311
01:12:07,851 --> 01:12:10,184
you’ll always find disappointments.

312
01:12:10,352 --> 01:12:15,685
I’ve seen parents who have doted on
their child, loved their child, this, that.

313
01:12:16,066 --> 01:12:19,736
Children mostly go astray.

314
01:12:22,477 --> 01:12:25,677
But if you have a detached love for your child,

315
01:12:26,267 --> 01:12:30,306
you do nice things for the child.

316
01:12:30,482 --> 01:12:37,282
At the same time, you know when to say ‘no’,
when it is not good. ” This I don’t like, don’t do it “,

317
01:12:37,767 --> 01:12:39,882
you must say that.

318
01:12:43,433 --> 01:12:46,786
But detachment is even wider than that.

319
01:12:48,830 --> 01:12:52,540
Like some people are very fond of food.

320
01:12:54,378 --> 01:12:55,378
So,

321
01:12:57,493 --> 01:13:01,520
to say that you be detached from food is very difficult for them.

322
01:13:02,115 --> 01:13:06,631
Specially, at a certain age, I think, they are very fond of good

323
01:13:07,069 --> 01:13:11,901
food and all that. Gandhiji has talked about Aswad:

324
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:14,306
you should not have any taste.

325
01:13:14,878 --> 01:13:19,945
But as you grow in Sahaja Yoga,
you’ll find automatically it will happen.

326
01:13:21,545 --> 01:13:24,678
All your fascination about food will drop out.

327
01:13:26,088 --> 01:13:30,488
That is another sign that you are absolutely detached about food.

328
01:13:30,903 --> 01:13:35,703
Now, today I had My lunch,
I don’t know whether it is dinner or lunch,

329
01:13:35,904 --> 01:13:38,026
 ’cause I had it at about five o’clock,

330
01:13:38,182 --> 01:13:41,116
so I don’t know wich part of the day it is.

331
01:13:41,261 --> 01:13:44,861
And if I don’t eat, it also makes no difference to Me,

332
01:13:46,261 --> 01:13:49,872
 it doesn’t make Me weak or in any way unhappy.

333
01:13:52,586 --> 01:13:58,292
But thinking about food is just spoiling your brain.

334
01:13:59,248 --> 01:14:01,582
Many people just think about food.

335
01:14:01,764 --> 01:14:05,455
We went to their house: ” Oh, they had made such nice things.

336
01:14:05,555 --> 01:14:08,272
“We went to this house ” They’ve made such nice things.”

337
01:14:08,432 --> 01:14:12,280
What’s the use? You already have eaten, finished, now, done.

338
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:14,933
Now, why are you thinking about that?

339
01:14:15,803 --> 01:14:20,536
Or: ” I went to somebody’s house,
they had given me a horrible food.

340
01:14:21,041 --> 01:14:24,374
” Why to think of food, I still don’t understand.

341
01:14:24,955 --> 01:14:27,355
Whatever has happened has happened.

342
01:14:27,518 --> 01:14:31,451
By thinking you cannot get back what you have been eating,

343
01:14:31,630 --> 01:14:33,630
or what you are going to eat.

344
01:14:33,753 --> 01:14:37,880
It’s there, whatever is there you have to eat, you see,
 what can you do?

345
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:42,404
For example, today, they asked Me:
”Mother, will you have hot dog?"

346
01:14:42,544 --> 01:14:46,882
In Hindi language it means real hot dog – means:

347
01:14:47,041 --> 01:14:50,156
garam kupte – they call that.

348
01:14:51,922 --> 01:14:54,322
I said ” All right, I’ll have it “.

349
01:14:54,482 --> 01:14:59,882
They said ” All the Americans eat. ”
” All right, I am an american, give Me “.

350
01:15:01,010 --> 01:15:06,150
But when you know something will not
do good for your teeth or something, you should not eat.

351
01:15:06,567 --> 01:15:10,119
For example, the beef is very bad for the teeth, very bad.

352
01:15:10,314 --> 01:15:13,084
That’s why you people loose your teeth very fast.

353
01:15:13,223 --> 01:15:18,532
Many people ask Me in the interview ”
Are your denture your own? ” I said: ” Of course, Mine “.

354
01:15:19,803 --> 01:15:21,803
They can’t believe it’s Mine.

355
01:15:22,898 --> 01:15:26,365
Because I know what not to eat for the teeth’s sake.

356
01:15:28,890 --> 01:15:32,124
But one should not be attached to an idea,

357
01:15:32,639 --> 01:15:34,952
that’s even subtler attachments.

358
01:15:35,092 --> 01:15:38,655
That has really killed this world with so many problems of

359
01:15:38,775 --> 01:15:42,278
fanaticism, racialism, I don’t know what.

360
01:15:43,782 --> 01:15:46,916
Now, here, see the contradictions people have:

361
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:51,133
they go to the sea to get darker, and they have racialism.

362
01:15:52,398 --> 01:15:54,521
Why do you go to the sea?

363
01:15:54,937 --> 01:15:57,545
If you go to become darker,

364
01:15:57,686 --> 01:16:00,686
then why do you hate the people who are dark?

365
01:16:02,051 --> 01:16:06,745
Such a contradiction because the brain is not in balance.

366
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:10,335
And for that you have racialism,

367
01:16:12,479 --> 01:16:13,947
you become racist.

368
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:19,483
If not that, you have another conditioning that

369
01:16:19,662 --> 01:16:24,995
there are different casts and according to the cast,
you should go, in India.

370
01:16:25,835 --> 01:16:30,768
How can there be any cast when everybody
has the Spirit in their heart.

371
01:16:31,842 --> 01:16:36,909
They won’t eat from another lower cast,
they are higher cast, this, that.

372
01:16:37,973 --> 01:16:42,695
This brain is the one which creates all kinds of conditionings,

373
01:16:42,984 --> 01:16:46,516
and all those great Saints who have lived on this earth,

374
01:16:46,616 --> 01:16:49,552
wether they were in India or abroad or anywhere,

375
01:16:49,751 --> 01:16:54,552
all of them have stood against this nonsense of discrimination.

376
01:16:55,107 --> 01:16:58,539
That comes from brain, you know, ask them

377
01:16:58,679 --> 01:17:02,905
” Why do you think like that, you are higher than others? ”

378
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:05,961
Like the germans think they are the highest race.

379
01:17:06,108 --> 01:17:08,580
Now, who will believe that bull story, I don’t know?

380
01:17:08,699 --> 01:17:10,921
It is absolutely nonsensical story:

381
01:17:11,041 --> 01:17:16,072
germans, the ones who have killed children in the gas chamber

382
01:17:16,212 --> 01:17:21,211
and enjoyed that, they must be the lowest race ever going!

383
01:17:23,394 --> 01:17:27,977
But they think they are the highest race! How can they be?

384
01:17:28,571 --> 01:17:31,658
Tomorrow, Rwanda people will say: ” We are the highest race,

385
01:17:31,779 --> 01:17:35,245
because we can kill each other nicely in the open. ”

386
01:17:38,466 --> 01:17:42,532
So, to think yourself to be higher than others,

387
01:17:42,692 --> 01:17:48,068
to think that you’re more beautiful than others, others are ugly

388
01:17:49,001 --> 01:17:55,046
– all this is the brain which takes you to ego,

389
01:17:56,654 --> 01:18:00,920
and the ego is the one who befools you completely all the time.

390
01:18:02,447 --> 01:18:04,514
That’s the job of Shri Krishna.

391
01:18:05,622 --> 01:18:08,489
The story you must have heard about Narada

392
01:18:08,618 --> 01:18:12,399
who never wanted to see, who thought he was a great man

393
01:18:12,515 --> 01:18:17,047
because he was never attracted to a woman,
and he was challenging even Shiva.

394
01:18:18,734 --> 01:18:23,067
Then Shri Krishna played a trick on him, He always plays tricks.

395
01:18:23,238 --> 01:18:28,873
He sent two Gandharvas to tease him.

396
01:18:29,427 --> 01:18:32,627
They went down and they asked Narada. They said

397
01:18:32,782 --> 01:18:36,164
” You are such a beautiful man, such a handsome person,

398
01:18:36,304 --> 01:18:39,894
there is a marriage going on of a lady [Rupoghadi, UNCLEAR]

399
01:18:40,049 --> 01:18:42,291
she is very beautiful, she is a princess

400
01:18:42,411 --> 01:18:45,823
and why don’t you go there, she’ll definitely marry you.

401
01:18:45,962 --> 01:18:50,962
” And they pampered his ego, you see,
such a lot, he started floating in the air.

402
01:18:51,121 --> 01:18:55,525
And he said ”All right, I am going to go there, I am so handsome.”

403
01:18:55,744 --> 01:19:02,560
Ego. He went there, and this princess came out with a garland.

404
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:06,845
She looked at him and she giggled first and then she laughed aloud

405
01:19:07,049 --> 01:19:08,649
and then she went away.

406
01:19:09,564 --> 01:19:12,401
He couldn’t understand, looked at these two persons,

407
01:19:12,659 --> 01:19:18,036
they said ”It’s all right, now, it doesn’t matter,
maybe somebody is better looking, then you.”

408
01:19:18,552 --> 01:19:22,857
So, Narada was very angry, he went to the lake.

409
01:19:23,317 --> 01:19:27,183
When he looked into the lake, his face was like a monkey.

410
01:19:29,537 --> 01:19:34,159
He’s become a monkey because this ego makes you a monkey.

411
01:19:35,286 --> 01:19:40,910
And you start thinking: ah, you are great,
you are very beautiful, you are this thing, that thing…

412
01:19:41,050 --> 01:19:42,116
But you are not.

413
01:19:43,431 --> 01:19:45,897
Because if you are, you won’t think.

414
01:19:47,456 --> 01:19:54,256
Whatever you are, you don’t think about it. You don’t think:
”I am a human being“, do you say that?

415
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:58,544
Or do you say ” I have no tails “, do you boast of that?

416
01:19:58,941 --> 01:20:02,465
Whatever you are not, then you boast: ” I am very beautiful,

417
01:20:02,664 --> 01:20:06,017
I am very good looking, others are ugly, this thing “.

418
01:20:06,136 --> 01:20:10,679
Then Shri Krishna plays a part through the Maya,

419
01:20:11,910 --> 01:20:15,443
and He gives a big lesson to that person.

420
01:20:17,815 --> 01:20:18,815
It happens.

421
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:23,469
So, never think that you are something great,

422
01:20:23,807 --> 01:20:27,873
or you have achieved this in life and achieved that in life,

423
01:20:29,819 --> 01:20:34,025
and that you are something a big Johnny.

424
01:20:34,679 --> 01:20:41,179
Nothing, it’s nothing but the ego that has moved on here

425
01:20:42,191 --> 01:20:44,991
and giving you these ideas, from the ego.

426
01:20:45,763 --> 01:20:48,163
And if you go even further with it,

427
01:20:48,302 --> 01:20:54,988
then Hitler may enter into your ego and you might behave like him.

428
01:20:55,465 --> 01:21:01,122
Or if you are conditioned, impossible to tell you anything.

429
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:06,142
Like this Hari Rama fellow I told you
”Why do you wear dhoti in this cold weather?”

430
01:21:06,281 --> 01:21:09,328
He said ” My guru has told me to wear dhoti “.

431
01:21:09,495 --> 01:21:11,590
”So what sort of a guru is it,

432
01:21:11,709 --> 01:21:14,031
that he makes you feel cold. I mean, I am a Mother,

433
01:21:14,215 --> 01:21:16,177
I don’t like all this nonsense.”

434
01:21:16,293 --> 01:21:18,773
He said ” No, but my guru has said “.

435
01:21:19,726 --> 01:21:23,356
What a conditioning! And conditioning

436
01:21:23,582 --> 01:21:28,534
for something which is absolutely absurd and ridiculous.

437
01:21:29,427 --> 01:21:34,347
Now see, Americans are most vulnerable to such a thing.

438
01:21:35,886 --> 01:21:38,079
You start any nonsense,

439
01:21:38,210 --> 01:21:41,657
immediately the Americans are the first to jump on it, immediately.

440
01:21:41,796 --> 01:21:47,768
Drugs you start, you start some sort of a,

441
01:21:48,615 --> 01:21:52,212
I can say, fancy dress.

442
01:21:52,927 --> 01:21:56,394
It will start in Paris but will be sold in America.

443
01:21:57,372 --> 01:22:01,172
Immediately. There are on the look-out of something new.

444
01:22:01,627 --> 01:22:04,894
It might be a monkey trick, but they will do it.

445
01:22:05,536 --> 01:22:11,805
I don’t know why Americans who are the residents of

446
01:22:11,965 --> 01:22:17,420
Shri Krishna’s land have no discretion at all,

447
01:22:18,433 --> 01:22:20,833
what to accept, what not to accept.

448
01:22:21,825 --> 01:22:25,765
They are the worst, they are worse than children even,

449
01:22:25,882 --> 01:22:29,972
there is no maturity of any kind: ” What’s wrong? ”

450
01:22:33,742 --> 01:22:39,388
So, the discretion which is the center we have here of Hamsa

451
01:22:39,766 --> 01:22:47,801
which is ruled by Vishuddhi, is completely sometimes blocked.

452
01:22:49,071 --> 01:22:53,813
Like one lady who came to America told Me very boastfully: ”

453
01:22:55,326 --> 01:22:58,929
Have you been to the pubs in England? ” I said ” No.

454
01:23:00,120 --> 01:23:05,080
Why? ” ” Oh, my God, what pubs you have here! You know,

455
01:23:05,298 --> 01:23:08,164
I went to the best ” I said ” Which one? ”

456
01:23:08,295 --> 01:23:11,866
“It’s known as Hermit’s pub ”

457
01:23:12,124 --> 01:23:17,104
” What is so special? ” Very high class lady, very high class

458
01:23:17,630 --> 01:23:20,645
– she says: ” You see, one man died,

459
01:23:20,824 --> 01:23:22,947
for one month nobody lifted the body,

460
01:23:23,066 --> 01:23:25,933
the whole thing was filled with the stink.

461
01:23:26,221 --> 01:23:27,954
So the stink is preserved

462
01:23:28,383 --> 01:23:31,558
and even the cowwebs are preserved as they are there.

463
01:23:31,777 --> 01:23:34,514
Such a great thing was this: in,

464
01:23:34,693 --> 01:23:39,693
when I went, and really I felt so spiritual there?

465
01:23:43,471 --> 01:23:46,987
” Then she started boasting ” You see, we are free people.

466
01:23:47,206 --> 01:23:52,007
I allow my children to drink. I give them drinks.

467
01:23:54,150 --> 01:23:58,617
” I said: ” Really? ” ” Yeah, I can give them any alcohol, anyone.

468
01:23:58,773 --> 01:24:02,344
I do not say ‘not this, not that’ – no, they can have “.

469
01:24:02,523 --> 01:24:06,657
The children who were hardly twelve and forteen years of age.

470
01:24:07,642 --> 01:24:11,964
I said ” All right, if you have been doing that,

471
01:24:12,421 --> 01:24:14,954
what can I say? You are a great lady,

472
01:24:15,119 --> 01:24:20,919
I would not do to my children or to my grandchildren,
but you are great, namaskar “.

473
01:24:21,270 --> 01:24:23,603
After three, four months, we heard

474
01:24:24,107 --> 01:24:27,361
that there was a birthday party of the younger boy

475
01:24:27,515 --> 01:24:32,103
and she had given all these alcohols to them for the friends.

476
01:24:33,666 --> 01:24:36,520
God knows what happened – they had candles and this and that

477
01:24:36,699 --> 01:24:43,822
– the whole house got burnt and all the children, her sons

478
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:48,445
and these two sleeping upstairs, all got burnt and died.

479
01:24:53,664 --> 01:24:56,084
Boasting about nonsense,

480
01:24:57,037 --> 01:25:01,689
like: ” I have had five hundred men with me “.

481
01:25:02,503 --> 01:25:05,437
Another will say: ” I have so many women. ”

482
01:25:05,658 --> 01:25:12,344
I mean, you are stupid fools because you are organizing

483
01:25:12,722 --> 01:25:17,166
nice way to go to hell, and you are all going to go to hell,

484
01:25:17,523 --> 01:25:22,483
this is what it is to be told to them. If you go on like this,

485
01:25:22,741 --> 01:25:24,408
what will happen to you?

486
01:25:24,815 --> 01:25:28,015
Accumulating everything that will destroy them,

487
01:25:28,645 --> 01:25:33,378
doing everything that will destroy.
” Oh that’s good!” I said ” Why? ”

488
01:25:33,664 --> 01:25:40,410
” You know, if you take that, then in two minutes you go off. ”

489
01:25:40,589 --> 01:25:43,322
I said: ” To where? To hell, or where? “.

490
01:25:45,093 --> 01:25:50,360
Anything that is destructive,
I don’t know why the Americans should accept it,

491
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:54,031
when they have Shri Krisna as their Lord.

492
01:25:57,583 --> 01:26:00,583
It is to be understood by Sahaja Yogis also,

493
01:26:01,115 --> 01:26:05,460
that you have to really transform
you have to serve to such an extent

494
01:26:05,619 --> 01:26:09,619
that what it is, whatever is destructive should be given up.

495
01:26:12,759 --> 01:26:14,258
First of all,

496
01:26:14,515 --> 01:26:18,382
I find some men and ladies with such long faces, you know.

497
01:26:20,437 --> 01:26:25,290
How can you be? You are living in the country of Leeladhara.

498
01:26:26,223 --> 01:26:28,890
He is the One who made everybody dance,

499
01:26:29,576 --> 01:26:34,893
and He is the One who sprayed Ras, Ra is energy, Dha is with

500
01:26:35,767 --> 01:26:40,163
– Ra-Dha. Ra is energy, the One who sustains energy.

501
01:26:40,580 --> 01:26:47,544
The One who did the mental energy enlightened and to sustain it,

502
01:26:47,862 --> 01:26:52,395
how can you people take to adharma,

503
01:26:52,733 --> 01:26:56,666
to immorality, and to destruction, I just can’t understand.

504
01:26:59,736 --> 01:27:04,022
I don’t know what are His plans are, very well,

505
01:27:04,668 --> 01:27:09,668
but He has to really save people of America from

506
01:27:09,808 --> 01:27:13,453
all kinds of nonsense they do morning till evening.

507
01:27:15,279 --> 01:27:19,346
There’s nobody who is sensible in the politics,

508
01:27:20,061 --> 01:27:25,556
nobody who has a good character at a very high positions,

509
01:27:25,748 --> 01:27:29,604
what sort of things! You cannot get one man

510
01:27:29,815 --> 01:27:34,548
whom you can say he is all right
and he will do good to your nation.

511
01:27:36,788 --> 01:27:39,388
Criticizing others, they are very good.

512
01:27:39,585 --> 01:27:42,585
Like we had this plague, this thing not much

513
01:27:42,721 --> 01:27:47,958
– this little bit came out,
they have published it all over these media,

514
01:27:48,375 --> 01:27:53,355
they’ve stopped all our ships,
stopped all our aeroplanes, made such a fuss,

515
01:27:53,494 --> 01:27:56,765
put us into so much trouble – what about your AIDS,

516
01:27:56,904 --> 01:27:59,571
which you are giving Prasad everywhere.

517
01:28:02,658 --> 01:28:09,403
It’s very surprising that with your brain
enlightened by Shri Krishna,

518
01:28:09,900 --> 01:28:13,610
how could people accept even mentally

519
01:28:13,967 --> 01:28:18,068
– person like Freud. How could you accept Freud?

520
01:28:18,466 --> 01:28:20,132
I just can’t understand.

521
01:28:21,620 --> 01:28:25,087
And now you are all ruined. So, now we are worried.

522
01:28:25,310 --> 01:28:28,048
They don’t what to do. Now they are breaking families,

523
01:28:28,168 --> 01:28:33,635
and all the logical conclusions
they reach is just the opposite of Shri Krishna.

524
01:28:33,873 --> 01:28:35,610
Like this Simpson killed his wife.

525
01:28:35,711 --> 01:28:38,587
All right, he killed, finished, this Simpson business.

526
01:28:38,775 --> 01:28:43,191
Now they are coming out big theories, see now: why psychologically

527
01:28:43,331 --> 01:28:46,131
he killed, because he was married to her.

528
01:28:46,485 --> 01:28:50,056
When you marry only you kill your wife or your husband.

529
01:28:50,236 --> 01:28:53,369
– So, you should not marry: what a conclusion!

530
01:28:54,084 --> 01:28:57,666
Tomorrow they’ll say that people are killing each other,

531
01:28:57,815 --> 01:29:00,624
so allow them to have weapons in their hand.

532
01:29:00,724 --> 01:29:04,324
Now, they want to allow them to have some drugs also.

533
01:29:05,505 --> 01:29:09,705
Allow them to have homosexuality, allow them to have all this.

534
01:29:10,585 --> 01:29:15,088
Because, I think, these people in charge of affairs

535
01:29:15,346 --> 01:29:19,084
do not want anybody to live,

536
01:29:20,214 --> 01:29:23,028
think that ” Let them fight among themselves, do what they like,

537
01:29:23,150 --> 01:29:25,075
we should have our own seats. ”

538
01:29:25,231 --> 01:29:28,853
The way they are not worried about the immorality

539
01:29:29,033 --> 01:29:35,679
and all the destructive forces
that are acting on American children,

540
01:29:36,255 --> 01:29:42,564
american youth and american people, not bothered about them.

541
01:29:44,977 --> 01:29:57,020
So, tonight we are praising Shri Krishna who is Yogeshwara.

542
01:29:58,980 --> 01:30:03,880
He eats but He does not eat. He sleeps but He does not sleep.

543
01:30:05,604 --> 01:30:14,703
He has wives but He has no wife. Like this is the Yogeshwara,

544
01:30:15,101 --> 01:30:18,834
and that is what you are Yogis, and He is your Ishwara,

545
01:30:18,970 --> 01:30:21,303
so, you have to try to be like Him.

546
01:30:21,674 --> 01:30:26,686
Let your brain be enlightened by His blessings.

547
01:30:26,845 --> 01:30:31,512
And you’ll become that great personality
that encompasses everything,

548
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:35,786
that sees everything, that gives you discretion,

549
01:30:36,348 --> 01:30:39,015
that makes you understand what’s wrong.

550
01:30:39,226 --> 01:30:45,281
And you feel enthousiastic about changing this America

551
01:30:45,638 --> 01:30:49,130
with all your efforts, with all the mind.

552
01:30:49,309 --> 01:30:52,066
That’s the most important thing you have to do.

553
01:30:52,281 --> 01:31:00,281
As it is, He is a Kubera, He is the Lord of Wealth

554
01:31:00,638 --> 01:31:03,051
and He has given you such a lot of

555
01:31:03,309 --> 01:31:06,176
wealth all around, you see, just very near

556
01:31:06,621 --> 01:31:10,021
New York, you should have such a beautiful places.

557
01:31:10,214 --> 01:31:14,102
In every way, you are blessed: you have money,

558
01:31:14,202 --> 01:31:16,735
you have everything, you have brains.

559
01:31:16,940 --> 01:31:20,140
Everything is there. What is lacking is wisdom,

560
01:31:22,615 --> 01:31:24,872
with everything, with you. Supposing,

561
01:31:25,567 --> 01:31:28,483
you have a car.

562
01:31:29,893 --> 01:31:35,281
You’re having a car, you have got keys,
you have got engine, you have brake,

563
01:31:35,415 --> 01:31:40,618
everything, but you don’t know how to drive, so what will happen?

564
01:31:43,482 --> 01:31:44,815
This is what it is.

565
01:31:45,407 --> 01:31:53,045
So, as Sahaja Yogis from America,
you have a very, very, very special responsibility,

566
01:31:53,978 --> 01:31:55,978
very special responsibility.

567
01:31:56,399 --> 01:32:01,265
Today we’ll be saying His hundred
and eight names which are well-done,

568
01:32:02,507 --> 01:32:04,774
have come from Poona all the way.

569
01:32:05,582 --> 01:32:11,812
So that we’ll have it first and then a little Puja of the Devi.

570
01:32:12,963 --> 01:32:14,649
May God bless you!
