00:01.983 --> 00:05.059
As you know that

00:06.880 --> 00:14.030
our second chakra is very important.

00:15.492 --> 00:19.249
That’s why today is very important.

00:20.403 --> 00:26.023
So what is the second chakra? Do you know
which one is the second chakra?

00:30.659 --> 00:32.853
What did they say?

00:45.208 --> 00:49.310
You must tell loudly. (yogi replies more
clearly: “Swadisthan”).

00:52.975 --> 00:56.268
Swadisthan is the chakra.

00:56.469 --> 01:02.141
Is very important because in this Kali Yuga

01:02.341 --> 01:06.018
Swadisthana works the most.

01:07.170 --> 01:13.910
We have so many agents

01:15.472 --> 01:19.373
to make it work and work very hard.

01:20.222 --> 01:24.144
You know what is in second chakra?

01:25.009 --> 01:30.618
In the second chakra what happens?

01:31.696 --> 01:36.870
That we are caught up by our ambition

01:38.509 --> 01:42.522
and the ambition makes you run up and down

01:42.723 --> 01:48.377
and I have seen many sahaja yogis
also getting lost.

01:48.578 --> 01:53.503
So it’s a very important day for all
of you.

01:58.377 --> 02:02.258
So second chakra is important because

02:02.459 --> 02:11.302
in modern times it is very, very cosmic
as well as active.

02:13.057 --> 02:16.773
We become very active, over active

02:17.552 --> 02:26.016
and we start thinking about everyone
with whom we are not concerned

02:26.870 --> 02:29.783
and bothering our heads.

02:30.070 --> 02:35.755
So today’s chakra is important because
it bothers your head,

02:35.971 --> 02:41.718
it troubles you a lot and you start
thinking about them.

02:42.997 --> 02:47.090
You start thinking, “What have you said?”

02:47.291 --> 02:54.193
“What has happened?” “Who is angry?”,
all sorts of nonsense.

02:55.299 --> 02:58.569
You are all sahaja yogis

02:58.770 --> 03:04.663
so you shouldn’t worry as to all these
people what the say, what they are doing.

03:04.864 --> 03:09.138
You should just enjoy yourself.

03:09.339 --> 03:12.758
Second chakra you must enjoy.

03:12.959 --> 03:16.832
That’s the best way to enjoy Sahaja Yoga.

03:20.157 --> 03:23.894
Where your Swadisthana is satisfied,

03:24.158 --> 03:28.542
nothing can disturb you.

03:29.166 --> 03:34.310
And Swadistana you can really look after,

03:34.511 --> 03:37.626
Swadisthan chakra is so much good

03:37.827 --> 03:44.939
for you because now you are sahaja
yogis and you can master it.

03:45.281 --> 03:50.392
That is one chakra which upsets.
Specially in the west

03:50.593 --> 03:55.566
people think too much all the time
thinking, thinking, thinking.

03:56.438 --> 04:03.796
That’s from Swadisthan. You get that
problem from Swadisthan.

04:04.285 --> 04:10.087
To satisfy Swadisthan you have to take
to silence.

04:10.546 --> 04:18.116
You have to take to quiet hood and look
at yourself.

04:18.317 --> 04:24.261
What is bothering you? What is troubling
you?

04:24.749 --> 04:30.037
What gives you ideas and thoughts
is Swadisthana.

04:30.238 --> 04:33.726
And some people think so much.

04:36.840 --> 04:39.608
There may not be any problem

04:39.809 --> 04:44.251
but they create their own problem
with the Swadisthana.

04:44.452 --> 04:48.689
And just go on bothering about the stuff.

04:50.496 --> 04:56.509
Swadisthan is very happy when you
are just laughing and enjoying

04:56.710 --> 05:00.715
and not bothered about nonsense.

05:00.916 --> 05:05.010
How much time we waste on nonsense!

05:05.405 --> 05:10.050
We don’t need it, sahaja yogis don’t
need it.

05:10.251 --> 05:13.642
It’s only those who are not yet realized.

05:13.843 --> 05:16.668
Must be suffering. They do suffer.

05:16.869 --> 05:20.907
And they might even trouble you
but just laugh at it.

05:21.108 --> 05:27.964
And you must pardon them, forgive them
because they are doing this

05:29.066 --> 05:33.755
because they can’t help it.

05:34.565 --> 05:38.204
You see, this Swadisthan chakra is

05:38.405 --> 05:41.832
bothering them so they can’t help it.

05:42.112 --> 05:45.927
So now, don’t allow your mind

05:46.128 --> 05:50.194
to bother about whatever nonsensical
thoughts are coming.

05:50.395 --> 05:55.457
All kinds of - all kinds of nonsensical
thoughts.

05:55.658 --> 06:00.572
You have nothing to do with them
but the thoughts are coming.

06:00.773 --> 06:08.696
Now this is the work of Mr Swadisthan.
He’s trying to distract you.

06:09.166 --> 06:12.373
You must get into silence.

06:14.956 --> 06:17.974
Once you get into silence,

06:18.175 --> 06:22.785
then he will go away and won’t bother you.

06:23.892 --> 06:31.326
So what you have to think now, not to have
anything to do with Swadisthan,

06:31.823 --> 06:36.942
but what you have to become is -
you are sahaja yogis

06:38.807 --> 06:42.418
and no Swadisthan should bother you.

06:43.300 --> 06:49.744
Australia is really great to have beautiful
children like this.

06:52.709 --> 06:55.372
And people care for children.

06:55.573 --> 06:59.845
That is first thing you must do is to care
for your children.

07:00.046 --> 07:04.311
That is fighting your Swadisthana.

07:04.724 --> 07:10.474
Anything bothers you, you worry about
your own children. Finished.

07:12.819 --> 07:19.494
You have to bother about them and
everything will work out.

07:19.979 --> 07:22.578
You are definitely blessed

07:22.779 --> 07:29.373
because you are not falling to the whims
of your Swadisthan.

07:29.574 --> 07:37.048
Definitely. And that is the chakra
of your country also.

07:37.718 --> 07:44.526
So it makes you run up and down and think
and think and think.

07:44.727 --> 07:49.832
Specially all the sahaja yogis have
this problem

07:51.118 --> 07:58.539
so you should just think that you
are sitting on Swadisthan

08:00.005 --> 08:08.928
and you have to ride it, not to be
ridden by it, alright?

08:10.129 --> 08:12.709
When I came first here, I found

08:12.910 --> 08:16.909
everybody’s head moving with
the Swadistana.

08:18.105 --> 08:22.725
Then they became silent and very peaceful

08:22.941 --> 08:27.403
and now I see you all and I’m very happy

08:27.901 --> 08:33.146
because that’s gone now. All that
nonsense is finished.

08:33.347 --> 08:36.458
And there is nothing bothers you.

08:43.415 --> 08:51.026
The root of all diseases is Swadisthan.
It comes from there.

08:53.476 --> 08:58.264
So you should know not to play
into the hands of Swadisthan

08:58.827 --> 09:02.271
and go into thinking, thinking, thinking.

09:02.472 --> 09:06.606
They go on thinking, I mean something
that doesn’t exist.

09:06.807 --> 09:09.244
They go on thinking.

09:12.263 --> 09:17.397
So any such thought comes in you, say,
"We don’t want to take". Finished.

09:18.113 --> 09:24.438
I am there to think for you.
You don’t think.

09:24.639 --> 09:31.610
If you have any problem, you let me know.
But you don’t think.

09:32.987 --> 09:39.945
What you can do, you can write it down
and send the problems to me.

09:40.146 --> 09:43.687
And I would like to see it, alright?
