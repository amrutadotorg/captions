00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.919
SY: Collectivity is the essence of this change,

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.807
this particular time now.

00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:10.454
I mentioned before that, that in the past,

00:00:10.655 --> 00:00:13.920
how Realization has been gained individually.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.193
Now, this time around,

00:00:16.394 --> 00:00:19.482
is the possibility of it being gained collectively,

00:00:19.683 --> 00:00:23.267
through the grace of Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:00:41.024 --> 00:00:44.029
Do you want me to talk anymore, Mother?

00:00:45.236 --> 00:00:48.614
- Should I talk anymore?
SM: Yes, please. It's all right.

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:51.799
SY: I shall talk a little more.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.896
What was I talking about?

00:00:58.097 --> 00:01:01.736
SY: Come in, sit. Oh yes, I was making a point that,

00:01:01.911 --> 00:01:04.358
that in the past

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.257
it has always been a very individual,

00:01:06.458 --> 00:01:08.278
gaining your Self-Realization has always been

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.276
a very individual exercise.

00:01:13.024 --> 00:01:15.510
One person would gain,

00:01:17.495 --> 00:01:20.750
one person who would work very hard usually.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.920
But now, they're saying because we have this particular age,

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.182
because we are knocking on the door of the age of Aquarius,

00:01:29.383 --> 00:01:31.982
because we are leaving - thank God -

00:01:32.183 --> 00:01:36.284
the age of confusion and false teaching behind us,

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.397
now this could happen collectively,

00:01:40.794 --> 00:01:42.759
en masse.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.080
There is the possibility of gaining Self Realization,

00:01:48.183 --> 00:01:52.431
gaining this experience, gaining this happening,

00:01:55.007 --> 00:01:57.873
many people - one time gaining.

00:01:58.661 --> 00:02:00.779
So again, coming back to the point I made earlier,

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:06.097
there are two things: one, the desire to gain one Self-Realization

00:02:06.298 --> 00:02:08.152
and then, a second desire,

00:02:08.353 --> 00:02:11.362
which is the desire to establish it and develop it.

00:02:11.563 --> 00:02:13.940
And I'm sure Shri Mataji will be talking tonight

00:02:14.141 --> 00:02:16.114
about both those things.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.880
Sahaja Yoga is basically those sort of techniques and practices

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.040
whereby we have the opportunity

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.131
to develop, to establish and develop our Realization.

00:02:29.332 --> 00:02:33.266
What does that mean? I mean, why, why? What? Why? So what?

00:02:33.467 --> 00:02:37.239
So why should we be interested in developing now

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.141
our Self-Realization once we've gained it? Well,

00:02:41.356 --> 00:02:44.987
again, it's related to the times in which we live.

00:02:45.368 --> 00:02:49.319
Pretty well everybody here tonight would have worked quite a bit

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.896
over the last few lifetimes,

00:02:52.097 --> 00:02:54.978
to reach this point, now.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.454
Most of us here would have gone through all sorts of things,

00:02:58.655 --> 00:03:02.519
would have gone through the desire for money, for power,

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.880
for physical gratification, for all sorts of things,

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.707
in the hope of finding happiness and peace and understanding.

00:03:09.908 --> 00:03:12.474
We've come to the conclusion that we haven't got,

00:03:12.665 --> 00:03:14.625
we haven't got there.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.158
And having discarded all that, we reach the point where,

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:20.840
" Right, what is it that satisfies?"

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.920
What is it that can give us

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.200
that peace, that understanding?

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.720
Well what is it? It is the connection with the Divine.

00:03:33.987 --> 00:03:37.039
The physical connection with the Divine.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.537
It's the only thing that could give us peace, joy

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.618
and the other by-products it can give us like health

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.743
and other silly things like finding a parking spot if you like.

00:03:53.025 --> 00:03:55.240
It might sound silly but in a way it's not.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.439
It's like, if one is about God's business

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.200
and the energy of God is flowing through us,

00:04:01.401 --> 00:04:05.607
then why shouldn't God find us a parking spot when we need it?

00:04:06.184 --> 00:04:08.744
One of those things that happen.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.929
So here we are, at a very particular time,

00:04:12.152 --> 00:04:14.284
very particular age,

00:04:14.485 --> 00:04:17.449
sitting in front of a very particular person,

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.000
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.399
SM: Hello,

00:04:26.175 --> 00:04:31.290
Brian, I don't know what you have said it. Just tell.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.280
Can you come?

00:04:34.674 --> 00:04:36.361
What did you tell them?

00:04:36.544 --> 00:04:39.511
SY: Oh, I just talked, I talked little about the  three...

00:04:39.712 --> 00:04:41.524
SM: Chakras.
SY: The three gunas...

00:04:41.725 --> 00:04:45.531
and very little about the chakras, nothing very much at all.

00:04:46.123 --> 00:04:50.376
And basically I worked

00:04:50.577 --> 00:04:54.047
I summed up - really you heard more or less what I said before.

00:04:54.248 --> 00:04:56.650
SM: All right.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.120
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.087
We are all seekers of truth,

00:05:23.288 --> 00:05:26.105
from the very beginning.

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.814
We believe

00:05:31.584 --> 00:05:35.949
that we'll get joy and happiness

00:05:36.912 --> 00:05:41.244
through various means and various paths we trot.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.371
For example, some people believe

00:05:46.761 --> 00:05:49.490
that they must have lots of money.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.600
Some believe they must be in power.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.214
It goes on like that,

00:05:58.415 --> 00:06:01.786
till you reach a point where you find out

00:06:01.987 --> 00:06:07.085
that those who have been running towards all these goals

00:06:07.286 --> 00:06:09.695
are not happy people.

00:06:09.896 --> 00:06:13.976
They have not achieved what they have been seeking.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.080
So we turn to God.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.040
When we turn to God also,

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.702
there sometimes we get very much disillusioned

00:06:24.903 --> 00:06:30.503
because those people who are talking about God

00:06:31.567 --> 00:06:34.582
are also either money-oriented

00:06:34.773 --> 00:06:37.039
or power-oriented.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.640
They are not happy people.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.680
That makes us very frustrated sometimes,

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.360
but the search is going on within ourselves,

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.240
consciously or unconsciously.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.480
We are trying to seek the truth,

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:59.074
and this seeking is given to us by God himself.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:04.760
We want to seek, all the time

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.600
something that is pleasurable,

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.441
that is happiness, that is joy.

00:07:12.888 --> 00:07:15.485
Now here as he has told you,

00:07:15.686 --> 00:07:20.640
this is the machinery that works out our Self-realisation.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.574
So, whatever I am going to tell you

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:26.416
is the knowledge of the roots.

00:07:26.617 --> 00:07:31.281
Through science and through other knowledge,

00:07:31.482 --> 00:07:33.083
the human knowledge,

00:07:33.284 --> 00:07:35.408
we know about the tree.

00:07:35.609 --> 00:07:40.909
But we have to become subtler beings to know about our roots.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:47.465
This knowledge was known in our country, long time back,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.517
not that I have started anything new.

00:07:51.718 --> 00:07:55.511
Only thing, I have been able to devise a method

00:07:55.712 --> 00:08:01.877
by which many people can get Realization at the same time.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:05.600
The old methods were to cleanse yourself,

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.920
to go into all kinds of cleansing and

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:16.756
chakras by centre by centres to evolve a personality

00:08:16.957 --> 00:08:19.066
and it would take many years,

00:08:19.267 --> 00:08:21.574
 maybe many lives.

00:08:22.275 --> 00:08:24.236
But in those days,

00:08:24.443 --> 00:08:27.188
when we are in such a chaos,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.680
and all the time we are facing a challenge

00:08:32.832 --> 00:08:37.226
it is important that it should happen the other way around.

00:08:37.583 --> 00:08:40.160
The other way around is like this,

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.959
that first you get your Realization, somehow.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.440
You may not be clean, there may be problem,

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.502
there may be physical problem

00:08:48.703 --> 00:08:51.680
there may be other problems within you - doesn't matter.

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.247
You get your Realization,

00:08:53.448 --> 00:08:56.302
means you get the light in your hand.

00:08:56.503 --> 00:08:58.640
Once you get the light in your hand,

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.680
you can yourself see what's wrong with you.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.040
Say, I am holding a snake in my hand

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.159
and somebody says, "You are holding a snake, so throw it away."

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.880
So I wouldn't like it, somebody challenging my ego

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.960
that as if I don't know what is a snake.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.736
In the dark, I cannot see the snake.

00:09:15.937 --> 00:09:20.376
But if there is light, I'll throw it away immediately.

00:09:20.577 --> 00:09:24.529
That is the principle on which Sahaja Yoga works out.

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:28.723
Sahaja means, "sa" means "with" and "ja" is "born with you"

00:09:28.924 --> 00:09:31.120
means a spontaneous happening

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:35.284
of your union, of your attention, with the Divine,

00:09:35.485 --> 00:09:38.270
the all-pervading Power of God's love.

00:09:39.584 --> 00:09:45.446
This All-pervading Power has got vibratory awareness in it.

00:09:46.967 --> 00:09:50.479
And it gives you also that vibratory awareness,

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.537
once you are connected with it.

00:09:52.738 --> 00:09:55.098
Not only that, but this vibratory awareness

00:09:55.299 --> 00:09:58.599
starts flowing through your fingertips, here,

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.830
and you can feel what is wrong with you

00:10:02.013 --> 00:10:04.159
or what is wrong with others.

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:08.400
Is a very simple method of deducting

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:12.480
how to correct yourself in the light of the Spirit.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:16.160
When you become one with the Spirit

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.880
this vibratory awareness starts flowing through your hands

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:22.960
and through your fontanele bone area.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:26.280
This is what Christ called as the baptism.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.240
This is the real baptism. it's a happening,

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.480
it's a living process. He has talked of the living God

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.560
and the living process, not of the dead - just comes somebody

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.858
and put water on your head and say that "You are baptised."

00:10:39.059 --> 00:10:41.960
In the same way, hindus have a custom

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:46.675
of giving Realization in a way

00:10:46.876 --> 00:10:49.777
that they call it, is a ritual

00:10:49.978 --> 00:10:53.406
in which they say, "Now you have become a brahmin."

00:10:54.756 --> 00:10:57.743
By paying some money to some priest,

00:10:57.944 --> 00:11:01.359
they think now he has become a brahmin, now he is certified.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:04.560
This is all artificial, this is not real.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:09.179
In every religion they have taken this as a ritual.

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:13.560
To form a ritual by that artificial ritual

00:11:13.769 --> 00:11:16.881
they think they can certify that you are a realised soul

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:21.601
or you are a "pir" in the islamic religion

00:11:21.802 --> 00:11:25.246
or you are a Christian in a Christian religion

00:11:25.447 --> 00:11:27.978
or in any religion like that.

00:11:28.327 --> 00:11:32.167
To be honest, these are all artificial methods.

00:11:32.608 --> 00:11:36.452
Real method is, that this triangular bone

00:11:36.653 --> 00:11:40.920
which has got this Kundalini as in itself - is the force,

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:45.320
has to rise actually just like a primule in a seed.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.250
It's a living process,

00:11:47.425 --> 00:11:49.934
like a seed when you put it in the Mother Earth

00:11:50.135 --> 00:11:52.760
the primule of that seed just rises.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:56.160
and comes upward, by itself.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:59.880
It comes upward and creates the plant.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.880
It is not that you pull out the primule

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:05.399
and say that, "This is the plant"

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.288
or you just bless the seed

00:12:07.489 --> 00:12:09.471
and say, "Now the plant has been created."

00:12:09.685 --> 00:12:11.280
It's a living process.

00:12:11.481 --> 00:12:13.468
Now we have reached at a stage,

00:12:13.669 --> 00:12:16.200
where we call ourselves as human beings

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:19.960
and you know very well that our central nervous system

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.560
has achieved lots of sensitivities

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.720
which the animals don't have.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:28.360
Like, they don't understand beauty,

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:32.120
animals don't understand dirt, filth.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:35.524
You can take an animal through dirt and filth

00:12:35.725 --> 00:12:41.880
and you cannot take a human being through that.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.520
Because a human being can understand

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:52.343
but a dog or a horse cannot understand that this is dirty or filthy.

00:12:53.585 --> 00:12:56.240
What happens really is that human beings

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.280
have developed within themselves the sensitivity

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:02.391
to beauty or to the filth,

00:13:02.592 --> 00:13:03.858
automatically.

00:13:04.059 --> 00:13:06.090
What have you done? Have you paid for it?

00:13:06.291 --> 00:13:07.757
Have you read something?

00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.092
Nothing of the kind.

00:13:09.283 --> 00:13:12.058
Automatically, spontaneously, it has evolved within us

00:13:12.259 --> 00:13:14.895
these powers of sensitivity.

00:13:15.964 --> 00:13:18.920
Now, the powers of sensitivity are there,

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.940
but still we are not at the absolute point

00:13:22.141 --> 00:13:25.960
which we can see the way there is chaos all around us.

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:28.881
People are in a chaotic conditions,

00:13:29.082 --> 00:13:30.924
now you see there are diseases coming up,

00:13:31.125 --> 00:13:32.688
you can't explain how they come up,

00:13:32.889 --> 00:13:34.295
people are doing wrong things

00:13:34.496 --> 00:13:36.755
without understanding this is wrong or right.

00:13:36.956 --> 00:13:40.297
All kinds of things are happening in this world,

00:13:40.498 --> 00:13:43.920
with all difficulties, with all problems

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.301
and we do not know what is the solution of it

00:13:46.502 --> 00:13:48.280
and why these are happening.

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:52.600
After all, if we are the epitome of our evolution,

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.160
if we are the top people in the evolution,

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:58.658
why should there be problems, why should there be any struggles,

00:13:58.859 --> 00:14:01.363
why there should be any diseases?

00:14:01.564 --> 00:14:03.480
But we are not.

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:07.799
We have to still, jump one stage higher,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.640
and that is the stage which we call as the Spirit.

00:14:13.216 --> 00:14:17.079
Every one of them who are great saints,

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:21.818
or who, we can say, are incarnations,

00:14:22.019 --> 00:14:23.617
prophets, have talked about this,

00:14:23.818 --> 00:14:26.280
that you have to be connected with God.

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:29.330
Even in the Quran,

00:14:29.531 --> 00:14:32.920
in the beginning it is said that you are to be connected with God.

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.840
Otherwise, you can never understand Him,

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:37.925
and if you do anything in His name,

00:14:38.126 --> 00:14:41.485
it will be all wrong, cruel or horrible.

00:14:41.686 --> 00:14:43.720
Very clearly said.

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.880
Also there is something good Quran has written,

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:50.440
that when the time of resurrection will come -

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.040
that is also described in the Bible -

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.419
your hands will speak.

00:14:57.737 --> 00:14:59.799
Now, hands cannot speak.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.442
But the sensitivity of the hands and the fingers

00:15:03.636 --> 00:15:06.431
will become such, that through your fingertips

00:15:06.632 --> 00:15:09.680
you will be able to diagnose

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:15.039
the problems of other people and yourself,

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:18.880
and if you know how to correct them, you can do it.

00:15:21.551 --> 00:15:23.069
Now this is a living process,

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:27.960
any living process - a sort of a flower becoming a fruit.

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:32.320
You can see very clearly a flower becoming a fruit

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:34.480
is a living process.

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:37.880
You cannot pay to the tree or to the Mother Earth,

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:42.084
"All right, we pay you so much money. Now you give us fruits".

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:46.480
Money is not understood by living processes.

00:15:47.015 --> 00:15:49.408
I mean supposing somebody is having a breathing trouble

00:15:49.609 --> 00:15:52.111
and you show him some money, will he stop breathing trouble?

00:15:52.312 --> 00:15:55.520
Will he be able to stop? No! It's a living process.

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.800
Again I say, it's a living process.

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:02.540
And when it is a living process, you cannot pay for it,

00:16:02.967 --> 00:16:05.986
nor can you put in any effort for it.

00:16:06.162 --> 00:16:07.679
It is effortless.

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:10.543
Sahaj also means effortless.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:14.640
Spontaneous, effortlessly it should work out.

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:18.649
You don't have to put in effort like standing on your head

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:22.320
or going to Himalayas. There's no need to do all that.

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.600
There's no need to fast,

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:28.351
there's no need to torture your body in any way.

00:16:29.656 --> 00:16:31.960
I cannot understand why people believe

00:16:32.161 --> 00:16:34.173
that we should torture our body

00:16:34.364 --> 00:16:36.599
so that we can become divine.

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.355
Is a wrong idea altogether.

00:16:39.899 --> 00:16:43.560
Because it is said - at least for Christians I can't understand.

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:46.840
Krishna, at the time of Krishna also, He didn't say so,

00:16:47.048 --> 00:16:50.368
but then Christ came after that.

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:54.280
You see, Krishna is manifested by Christ later on.

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:56.920
Everybody has manifested at different levels -

00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:01.618
like in a tree, you find at different times, something appears.

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:05.000
They are the flowers on the same tree of life.

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.385
There's no difference between them at all.

00:17:07.586 --> 00:17:10.573
But when you pluck the flowers and
say, "This is mine, this is mine" -

00:17:10.774 --> 00:17:13.490
with the dead flowers you can fight.

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:16.920
This is exactly what has happened today,

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:20.040
that's why they cannot relate them to each other.

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:21.960
But Christ Himself has said,

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:25.960
that, "Those who are not against Me are with Me".

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.120
Who are with Him?

00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:31.000
He didn't have much time to talk to people.

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.800
He had only three and a half years public life,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.690
and then he was crucified on a foolish thing

00:17:37.891 --> 00:17:41.760
like saying that he is a traitor and all kinds of things.

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:46.859
He had no chance even to tell people

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:50.398
about something subtler.

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:53.800
And this is something one should understand,

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.710
that in London I was struggling

00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:59.882
with seven, seven people for four years.

00:18:00.083 --> 00:18:03.254
Of course now it's different. Now I don't have to do that,

00:18:03.463 --> 00:18:06.475
because once you have established the foundation, the things are better.

00:18:06.676 --> 00:18:08.440
But it was so.

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:10.740
So imagine for three and a half years,

00:18:10.941 --> 00:18:12.984
what could Christ tell about things?

00:18:13.185 --> 00:18:16.820
Whatever he has said is also very much clearly understood

00:18:17.021 --> 00:18:19.453
when you are a realised soul.

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:23.423
If you are not a realized soul, you cannot even understand Him.

00:18:23.624 --> 00:18:28.411
Because He said that, "My God has asked Me to do this.

00:18:28.612 --> 00:18:30.044
My Father has asked Me".

00:18:30.245 --> 00:18:32.222
And He got Himself crucified

00:18:32.405 --> 00:18:34.450
and we say that He died for our sins.

00:18:34.651 --> 00:18:36.694
So now, why should we suffer more?

00:18:36.895 --> 00:18:39.476
He carried the cross. What is the need for us to suffer?

00:18:39.677 --> 00:18:43.080
Are we going to suffer more than He has suffered?

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:48.344
Is anybody can carry,

00:18:48.543 --> 00:18:52.651
 is anyone of those who say that, "We must suffer" -

00:18:52.852 --> 00:18:54.512
let them carry a cross for a while

00:18:54.713 --> 00:18:56.719
and we'll see how much they can suffer.

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:58.859
Is an absolutely wrong idea.

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:01.121
God doesn't want you to suffer at all.

00:19:01.322 --> 00:19:04.502
No, He doesn't want. He loves you, He's the most loving Father.

00:19:04.703 --> 00:19:06.352
He doesn't want to suffer you.

00:19:06.553 --> 00:19:10.000
He loves you and He will do everything that is possible

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:13.120
for you to enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:19:15.489 --> 00:19:19.280
So at this time, when we are faced with such difficulties -

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:21.725
people are telling Me that, "Now we are waiting

00:19:21.926 --> 00:19:25.400
for all the seven stars to come in and the whole world to collapse".

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:28.441
Because they don't want to live anymore.

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:33.239
This is the condition, this frustration that we are into,

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:37.440
but I tell you, there's nothing to worry about.

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.509
Whatever may be your situation,

00:19:39.692 --> 00:19:41.618
whatever may you have suffered with,

00:19:41.819 --> 00:19:44.942
whatever maybe your social problems

00:19:45.143 --> 00:19:47.117
or your physical problems,

00:19:47.318 --> 00:19:50.900
or your family problems, financial problems,

00:19:51.101 --> 00:19:54.240
all can be solved with one shot,

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:58.120
because there's the Mother Kundalini sitting there.

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:01.360
And when She rises She passes through the six centres,

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:05.039
which represent different, different capacities in you,

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:06.421
enlightens them

00:20:06.622 --> 00:20:09.959
and She grants you all these things that I have said.

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:14.840
But apart from that, you get connected with the All-pervading power

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:19.680
and you develop a collective consciousness within you,

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:21.680
collective consciousness.

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:24.839
It's not just saying, "We are brothers and sisters".

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:27.263
You just start feeling another person

00:20:27.464 --> 00:20:30.443
on your fingertips and you love that person.

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:36.305
And also you start feeling yourself on your fingertips.

00:20:36.506 --> 00:20:42.160
This is the greatest discovery in the whole world, I should say,

00:20:42.361 --> 00:20:45.720
that people can get their Self-Realization.

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:50.120
All other discoveries can complicate things,

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:53.520
can give problems, can be disputed,

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:55.502
but, this theory cannot,

00:20:55.703 --> 00:21:00.680
because this makes you a person with absolute values.

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:03.599
One doesn't have to tell, "Now you be righteous",

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:06.759
I've seen drug addicts giving up drugs overnight,

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:10.454
alcoholics giving up alcohols overnight.

00:21:10.655 --> 00:21:12.669
Even Brian was telling Me the other day

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:14.840
he used to smoke eighty cigarettes

00:21:15.038 --> 00:21:17.413
and then from next day he just stopped.

00:21:17.614 --> 00:21:19.056
I didn't know, but he told Me.

00:21:19.257 --> 00:21:22.243
He was in crutches when he came to Me.

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:26.960
So I have seen things happening like that, and it works out.

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:30.783
But for you it is better that you get your Self-Realization

00:21:30.984 --> 00:21:33.733
and you know about it what it is.

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.960
Actually to get Self-Realization

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:37.950
you don't have to know all these things.

00:21:38.151 --> 00:21:41.160
It is something like, to switch on the lights,

00:21:41.361 --> 00:21:43.318
you just have to know where the switch is.

00:21:43.519 --> 00:21:45.960
You don't have to know about the electricity,

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:49.049
about the organisation behind it, about the history behind it.

00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:51.840
Just this much - where is the switch.

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.680
In the same way, for your Realization,

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:57.376
you have to be switched on, that's all.

00:21:57.577 --> 00:21:59.482
But then, later on you should know,

00:21:59.683 --> 00:22:01.530
what is the mechanism that is worked out

00:22:01.731 --> 00:22:04.033
because if you want to give Realisation to others

00:22:04.234 --> 00:22:07.996
if you want to help others, then you must know about it.

00:22:08.939 --> 00:22:11.640
The peace - we talk about we should have peace,

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:13.480
we should have no atomic energy,

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.790
we should have not this problem, that problem.

00:22:15.991 --> 00:22:21.400
Everybody is suffering from sense of insecurity from each other.

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:24.703
Russia is afraid of America, America is afraid of Russia,

00:22:24.904 --> 00:22:26.919
everybody is afraid of each other.

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:30.188
We are human beings. Even animals are not so much afraid,

00:22:30.389 --> 00:22:33.400
as we are afraid of our brothers and sisters.

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.260
Why should we be so much afraid?

00:22:35.461 --> 00:22:37.268
Because we have not reached that stage

00:22:37.469 --> 00:22:39.774
where we are collective, we are one,

00:22:39.975 --> 00:22:43.560
where we feel that we are the part and parcel of the whole.

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:48.720
As you say, the microcosm becomes one with the macrocosm.

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:52.520
The microcosm starts feeling the whole.

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:57.760
One drop becomes the ocean. That's what has to happen.

00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:59.522
And when that happens,

00:22:59.723 --> 00:23:03.240
all your theories become absolutely actualised.

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:05.400
Like the other day somebody said, "Mother,

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:08.720
are you a capitalist or a communist?"

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:11.520
I said, "I am both". "How?"

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:14.840
I said, "I am a capitalist because I have powers,

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:18.601
and I am a communist because I must distribute them

00:23:18.802 --> 00:23:20.123
and share them with others.

00:23:20.324 --> 00:23:22.511
So I am a communist as well as a capitalist,

00:23:22.712 --> 00:23:26.040
both things together". Is so simple as that.

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:28.560
So you get completely integrated

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:31.120
and all these false notions and theories drop out.

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:33.776
These are all dogmas which are artificial,

00:23:33.977 --> 00:23:35.720
but basically a human being

00:23:35.921 --> 00:23:38.850
is the most beautiful thing God has created.

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:43.344
The most beautiful thing God has created is the human being.

00:23:43.545 --> 00:23:46.000
We have not known the beauty of human beings.

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:51.560
We can only know through the eyes of the Spirit.

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:53.636
When you become the Spirit,

00:23:53.837 --> 00:23:57.440
then you start enjoying the beauty of another person.

00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:59.560
Whatever may be the race, religion -

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:01.687
all these things do not come into your mind.

00:24:01.888 --> 00:24:04.760
From outside you cannot remove all these things.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.800
You cannot remove the differentiations between human beings,

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:10.585
you cannot. By logic you cannot.

00:24:10.786 --> 00:24:15.800
But by becoming realised you automatically do it.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.699
You just don't see any difference,

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:21.378
because where you go is the subtle form of yourself,

00:24:21.561 --> 00:24:23.177
which is the Kundalini.

00:24:23.378 --> 00:24:26.640
You just see a person in his chakras and not in his face,

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:30.040
in his dress, in his status or in his money.

00:24:31.688 --> 00:24:34.959
Now also, there were questions raised the other day

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.909
about so many false people

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:41.480
have been preaching about yoga, this, that and all that.

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:44.640
How to make out a false person from the real one.

00:24:44.841 --> 00:24:48.520
The first criteria should to be, "Does he take any money from you?".

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:52.200
Finished. On that point you can cancel most of them.

00:24:52.472 --> 00:24:54.919
But there are so many institutions which take money

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:57.017
in the name of God and run them.

00:24:57.208 --> 00:24:59.727
This is also very wrong. You should not.

00:24:59.928 --> 00:25:02.869
If you want to run an institution, in the name of God,

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:04.991
you need not take any money from anyone.

00:25:05.192 --> 00:25:07.901
What you can do is to, whatever it is -

00:25:08.102 --> 00:25:11.408
like Me now, we have no organisation,

00:25:11.607 --> 00:25:14.199
no membership, nothing of the kind.

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:17.059
We are so much attached to each other,

00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:18.883
that we are not bothered about

00:25:19.106 --> 00:25:21.388
taking money for a combination or anything.

00:25:21.589 --> 00:25:24.280
For example, if I've come here, I'm living with Brian.

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:27.760
If I go to Australia, I live with another person.

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.320
If they come there, they come to My house.

00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:33.639
At the most, they pay for travelling - that's all.

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:37.839
And that too through a travel agent, they don't pay Me or to anyone.

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:40.560
So there is no need to have big accounting

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:44.240
and big organisations and money and all this nonsense,

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:47.080
because this money is a thing that creates problem.

00:25:47.281 --> 00:25:49.188
You must have heard now, there's a...

00:25:49.389 --> 00:25:53.349
one person is found with so much of millions of money with him

00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:56.230
who was saying he is a born again.

00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:00.320
This kind of born again are not - this is self certification;

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:02.560
just a self certification, "I am born again".

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:05.560
A born again has certain powers.

00:26:05.761 --> 00:26:09.335
One power he has that he can raise the Kundalini of others

00:26:09.536 --> 00:26:12.600
and give them Realisation, firstly.

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:14.435
He doesn't take any money for it,

00:26:14.636 --> 00:26:16.282
he doesn't talk of money or anything.

00:26:16.483 --> 00:26:19.110
He can raise his hand and give Realization to others.

00:26:19.311 --> 00:26:21.594
He can feel the vibrations of another person

00:26:21.795 --> 00:26:23.864
and he can tell what's wrong with that person

00:26:24.063 --> 00:26:26.317
and also he can correct himself.

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:29.009
The third power he has got,

00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:32.429
that sitting down here, he can tell you about anyone you want to know,

00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:35.400
what are his chakras like, what are his problems.

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:38.120
Sitting down here he can say which are the people

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:40.040
who are realised soul or not,

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:43.240
which prime minister is a realised soul and which is not.

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.009
Sitting down here they will know,

00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:47.295
because is the sublest of subtle,

00:26:47.486 --> 00:26:49.549
of the ether as you can say.

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:52.120
We are all gifted with that.

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:55.040
It's all there - only thing you have to be put to the mains.

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:58.759
Like this instrument won't work till it is put to the mains.

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:01.100
In the same way, once you are put to the mains,

00:27:01.301 --> 00:27:05.440
you start working out your fantastic qualities,

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:08.960
which are very beautiful and glorious.

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:12.000
You automatically become virtous and righteous.

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:14.320
I don't have to give a sermon for that,

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:18.083
"Don't do this and don't do that". You just won't do it.

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:22.480
You won't do anything that will destroy you.

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:28.560
You go on to another path of construction of yourself,

00:27:28.759 --> 00:27:34.479
of your family, of your neighbours, of your city,

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:37.800
and then of your nation and the whole world at large.

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:39.800
This is what we have to do today.

00:27:40.001 --> 00:27:43.680
All the rest of talks and these things are not going to help at all.

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:48.783
Because people, in talks say something, forget next moment.

00:27:49.037 --> 00:27:50.362
Here you cannot forget

00:27:50.563 --> 00:27:53.160
because the whole thing works on your central nervous system,

00:27:53.361 --> 00:27:56.160
it becomes your awareness on central nervous system.

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:58.920
You start feeling it on your central nervous system -

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:02.760
that shows that you are fully evolved.

00:28:03.632 --> 00:28:08.040
All differences, all problems, all adherences

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:12.520
all wrong ideas of possessions just drop out.

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:14.329
You stand in your own glory.

00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:17.410
You are not reactionary, you do not react to anything.

00:28:17.577 --> 00:28:19.719
Neither you react,

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:23.080
nor you accept anything blindfolded.

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:25.800
You know what is exactly the right thing is

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.686
and what is right thing to be done

00:28:27.861 --> 00:28:29.786
and you stand on that right thing,

00:28:29.987 --> 00:28:36.349
without bothering about what is to be done for the compromise.

00:28:37.736 --> 00:28:42.248
Like Christ, you know, that he stood against Mary Magadalene

00:28:42.449 --> 00:28:45.352
and said, "Those who have not committed any sin

00:28:45.553 --> 00:28:48.092
can throw a stone at Me".

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:51.920
That's the courage of a realised soul,

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:55.160
that he knows this is the time he has to protect her, and he stands.

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:58.478
He has nothing to do with a prostitute, a man like Him.

00:28:58.872 --> 00:29:00.658
But he stands up and he says so.

00:29:00.859 --> 00:29:05.279
That courage, that quality, that personality

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:09.000
just dawns and you are surprised at yourself,

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:11.240
"How I could do it?".

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:15.359
Apart from that, there are many dynamic gifts you get.

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:17.408
Some people become great artists.

00:29:17.607 --> 00:29:20.025
We have in Australia only one girl -

00:29:20.226 --> 00:29:22.839
she became a great artist, very well known now.

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:28.680
And there are some people who become very great musicians, poets -

00:29:28.881 --> 00:29:31.401
all such qualities you can get.

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:36.068
But the best of all, that you become an innocent person.

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:38.920
You become very innocent.

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:42.136
All the so-called sins you have committed

00:29:42.337 --> 00:29:44.400
drop out and you become an innocent person

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:47.320
and a very powerful person,

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:51.760
very powerful and humble,

00:29:54.544 --> 00:29:59.957
very satisfied

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:04.955
and compassionate person - that's what you become.

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:07.439
It just happens,

00:30:07.606 --> 00:30:09.516
it is because it's all within you.

00:30:09.717 --> 00:30:11.856
It is not yet been manifested,

00:30:12.057 --> 00:30:14.279
like some clouds can cover the moon,

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:17.514
but when the clouds disappear, you can see the beautiful moon -

00:30:17.713 --> 00:30:19.125
in the same way.

00:30:19.326 --> 00:30:22.639
You become very energetic, you can work very hard,

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:25.314
you don't feel tired at all,

00:30:25.515 --> 00:30:29.160
because the energy is all the time flowing in you,

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:34.920
you respect whatever is to be respected very well

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:37.680
and you do not bother about things

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:41.000
which are not to be bothered about.

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:43.830
So many qualities you develop.

00:30:44.031 --> 00:30:45.879
I Myself never expected

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:49.288
that Sahaja Yoga will work to that extent, up to New Zealand,

00:30:49.489 --> 00:30:53.720
I never, never knew that it will go that far in my lifetime,

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:55.401
but it has spread so fast

00:30:55.584 --> 00:30:58.461
and so many people have been blessed.

00:30:58.662 --> 00:31:00.636
In Australia -

00:31:01.065 --> 00:31:05.020
I consider Australia and New Zealand as one cell,

00:31:05.221 --> 00:31:07.689
one place, one country, not two.

00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:09.664
Is one country is in the thing

00:31:09.855 --> 00:31:12.663
and is this red one that you see there,

00:31:12.864 --> 00:31:14.963
with four chakras - is the first one,

00:31:15.164 --> 00:31:18.193
is the centre of innocence.

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.640
And one day will come, I am sure of it,

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:22.520
that Australia and New Zealand

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.976
will be the leaders in spirituality,

00:31:25.215 --> 00:31:27.039
if not in anything else.

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:29.800
They have never invaded any country as such.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.280
Maybe that they came here and settled down

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:33.877
but they did not invade.

00:31:34.078 --> 00:31:40.528
So it's a very big assurance I have,

00:31:40.729 --> 00:31:43.872
because I have seen the way Australians

00:31:44.073 --> 00:31:46.591
are mobilising Sahaja Yoga all over.

00:31:46.792 --> 00:31:48.965
Only in Sydney we have got twelve centres.

00:31:49.166 --> 00:31:51.023
When we don't take any money,

00:31:51.224 --> 00:31:54.120
we don't have any organisation, we have no membership,

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:56.600
we have twelve centres in Sydney.

00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:59.440
That's how we should do something in New Zealand also

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:01.238
and I'm sure very soon,

00:32:01.429 --> 00:32:04.451
under the guidance of Brian, it will work out

00:32:04.652 --> 00:32:11.427
and that you all will achieve your epitome of your evolution,

00:32:11.628 --> 00:32:13.919
that is the absoluteness.

00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:16.449
May God bless you all.

00:32:18.488 --> 00:32:20.840
I'm sorry there's only one lecture.

00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:23.128
I am here only for one day

00:32:23.329 --> 00:32:25.790
so I cannot elaborately talk about it.

00:32:25.965 --> 00:32:27.824
But there are many tapes they have

00:32:28.025 --> 00:32:30.397
which you can hear about different, different subjects

00:32:30.598 --> 00:32:37.011
and you can also know what is, how to do the meditation.

00:32:37.212 --> 00:32:39.591
The meditation is only for five minutes in the morning

00:32:39.792 --> 00:32:41.496
and five minutes in the evening.

00:32:41.697 --> 00:32:44.718
You can learn everything from them. They know

00:32:44.919 --> 00:32:48.600
very well because they have been very, very senior Sahaja Yogis,

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:51.360
and are respected all over the world.

00:32:51.561 --> 00:32:54.237
Only thing, in number they are less and I was telling them,

00:32:54.438 --> 00:32:56.516
"If you get too many people, how will you manage?".

00:32:56.717 --> 00:32:58.520
They said, "We'll manage somehow, Mother".

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:01.991
So, that's how, but you have to cooperate with them little bit

00:33:02.192 --> 00:33:04.199
and it can work out.

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:08.360
We'll have the session of Realization now,

00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:10.656
but I would like you to ask Me questions,

00:33:10.857 --> 00:33:15.402
but not too many, because we don't have so much time.

00:33:16.256 --> 00:33:18.323
L: I cannot [actually realize]

00:33:18.490 --> 00:33:21.426
if we are the Spirit

00:33:21.641 --> 00:33:24.839
and if we have been in the world many, many times,

00:33:25.008 --> 00:33:27.209
why we are still killing one another?

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:29.079
SM: Why are we?
SY: Why are we...

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:34.159
If we have been evolving for such a long time towards the Spirit,

00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:37.394
why are we still killing each other?

00:33:37.595 --> 00:33:39.800
SM: That's the trouble, I agree with you.

00:33:40.001 --> 00:33:44.269
You see, these modern times are described in the Puranas

00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:48.239
as Ghor Kali Yuga - the worst times. These are the worst time

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:51.640
when the people will become absolutely horrid.

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:54.160
Because without getting connected with God,

00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:56.600
we started moving in another lines, you see.

00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:58.609
Because you were not connected with God,

00:33:58.810 --> 00:34:01.480
If we were connected with God, we would never have done it.

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:04.784
We have - by our many births,

00:34:04.985 --> 00:34:09.800
what has happened is that these centres were established within us.

00:34:10.001 --> 00:34:13.200
But how we have used this and how we have worked out,

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:16.827
I agree that it's, cannot understand why we are killing each other.

00:34:17.028 --> 00:34:19.179
The trouble is that we are not connected with God,

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:22.430
that's why we have done all these things.

00:34:22.771 --> 00:34:25.300
L: You say that God doesn't want us to suffer,

00:34:25.501 --> 00:34:28.707
but there is still a lot of suffering in the world.

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:33.159
SY: You say that God does not want us to suffer

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:35.920
but there is still a lot of suffering in the world.

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:39.759
SM: Human beings have created the suffering.

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:42.600
God did not, it's the human beings.

00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:46.240
They have to learn a lesson I think, by so many ways.

00:34:46.441 --> 00:34:49.840
They just want to destroy themselves. See the things they do,

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:53.025
the things they like - it's all self-destructive.

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:57.320
All the things they try to do - human beings - are self destructive.

00:34:57.521 --> 00:35:00.814
You see their behavior - you can't explain why they do it so stupidly,

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:03.823
so many things which will destroy. Now supposing

00:35:04.024 --> 00:35:08.880
you ask the bull to come and hit you, then what happens?

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:12.160
The bull will come and hit you.

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:16.600
God has given us freedom of choice.

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:19.360
In that you can go to heaven or to hell.

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:22.880
Now many people prefer to go to hell all the time -

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:25.520
this is the trouble. And you have to have your freedom,

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:28.360
because unless and until you have your freedom,

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:30.830
how can you enjoy your ultimate freedom?

00:35:30.997 --> 00:35:33.092
You have to have.

00:35:36.267 --> 00:35:39.599
G: When did you find the Realization yourself?

00:35:41.672 --> 00:35:43.125
SY: The gentleman wants to know

00:35:43.326 --> 00:35:46.279
where did you find the Realization yourself.

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:51.080
SM: I didn't find it, I had it from my childhood, all right?

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:54.160
But now I would say that don't ask questions about Me,

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:58.262
because it is better that you get your Spirit and then know Me.

00:35:58.463 --> 00:36:00.167
Not easy to know Me, you see,

00:36:00.368 --> 00:36:04.110
it's quite an illusive personality is before you.

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:15.880
SY: It is a Maori welcome, Shri Mataji.

00:36:20.814 --> 00:36:24.002
L: Thank you, Shri Mataji. Thank you [unclear]..

00:36:24.431 --> 00:36:27.232
SM: Thank you, thank you very much.

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:25.862
Beautiful.

00:37:26.093 --> 00:37:28.704
Do you know, we have in India

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:34.250
a clan or, you can call, a kind of people

00:37:34.451 --> 00:37:37.479
who are called as maoris living still in India.

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:40.679
And am I now going to go and find out about them.

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:44.520
And they come from the same province as I,

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:46.115
from the Maharashtra province.

00:37:46.316 --> 00:37:49.482
So we are going to find out about them

00:37:50.114 --> 00:37:51.830
L: I have a question.

00:37:52.031 --> 00:37:53.985
I find and I got a spiritual teacher

00:37:54.186 --> 00:37:56.717
and then I will be grounded and

00:37:59.567 --> 00:38:01.617
for the longest time I've been three months.

00:38:01.818 --> 00:38:06.047
I don't need to meditate, I don't need to do ritual.

00:38:06.248 --> 00:38:08.168
I just always am

00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:10.653
but I find that I get uncentered

00:38:10.868 --> 00:38:16.009
and what I like is that it always be that way and always

00:38:16.288 --> 00:38:20.748
without having to work at it or happen to go get it fixed.

00:38:20.966 --> 00:38:24.938
I don't get my meditation, my guru fixed.

00:38:25.121 --> 00:38:26.811
]

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:33.240
SY: She's saying that she goes to a guru or spiritual teacher

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:36.880
and can find a balance perhaps for three months,

00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:40.720
but then it doesn't last and says she has to find a,

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:46.760
another injection or fix and she has a strong desire

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:49.031
that she should gain

00:38:49.232 --> 00:38:52.751
this experience, this quality, this feeling

00:38:52.958 --> 00:38:54.845
all the time, she wants it all the time.

00:38:55.046 --> 00:38:57.960
SM: Yes, yes, you can always have it all the time, no doubt.

00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:01.840
But you see, when you go to a guru or anyone,

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:04.133
it's like a guru shopping.

00:39:04.316 --> 00:39:06.599
And I'm not a guru.

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:10.439
I'll make you your own guru, all right?

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:13.071
And you will know why you lose vibrations.

00:39:13.272 --> 00:39:14.712
It's not question of balance,

00:39:14.913 --> 00:39:16.961
it's not question of just feeling better.

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:20.520
You can feel better with some drinks also.

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:24.560
It's not that. It's something that you become empowered with,

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:27.240
something which you understand yourself,

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:29.480
something that you understand other people.

00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:32.675
It's not just merely just feeling better for a while,

00:39:32.876 --> 00:39:35.160
that's not the point.

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:38.705
You will become your own, own guru.

00:39:38.906 --> 00:39:43.160
You will know yourself where you are going wrong.

00:39:44.389 --> 00:39:46.920
SY: Anybody else?

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:21.560
The lady is asking about different energies

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:24.876
that can come into you and some of them are not very nice ones.

00:40:25.077 --> 00:40:26.924
SY: I think she is talking about entities also.

00:40:27.115 --> 00:40:29.495
SY: Oh, entities?

00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:37.760
SM: That's what it is, because it's not divine energies.

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:39.659
These are negative energies.

00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:41.224
They can all come into you

00:40:41.407 --> 00:40:43.919
but if you become divine, they run away.

00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:48.320
That's why you have to be...  yes, correct, entities is a good,

00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:50.800
you have seen - it's a good thing.

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:53.480
Because even to talk about them is sometimes difficult,

00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:56.600
but there are, all these negative forces are there,

00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:58.211
that's why we do wrong.

00:40:58.426 --> 00:41:00.319
But that we accept much easily.

00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:04.400
Because we have risen from matter, we go to matter very easily

00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:07.520
and we take those dead energies much more faster

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:10.053
than the real energy.

00:41:10.254 --> 00:41:12.359
But once you are a realized soul,

00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:16.040
then you are not affected by them.

00:41:17.944 --> 00:41:21.588
L: Mother, why is there so much ignorance in the world?

00:41:21.771 --> 00:41:24.401
I mean, in myself, too.

00:41:24.625 --> 00:41:28.279
When I look at that I realize now...

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:31.616
I was a Catholic for fourty years,

00:41:31.783 --> 00:41:34.039
and now I realise that

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:36.840
religion has never brought peace to the world.

00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:39.520
SM: It's correct.

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:43.440
See, you are all very simple people, naive people,

00:41:43.877 --> 00:41:45.167
L: Good people.

00:41:45.368 --> 00:41:46.919
SM: Good people. of course.

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:51.079
Now, there are set of very good people, many people, good people.

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:54.560
There are set of some evil people -

00:41:55.068 --> 00:41:57.375
they sit down and plan out.

00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:01.880
Like every religious book is being changed.

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:06.240
Now, I can say about our Bible, you should see clearly.

00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:08.560
Kahlil Gibran has said the same thing,

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:12.680
that, "Why mister Paul is there, in the Bible?"

00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:15.960
He's the one who transformed Bible into many things.

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:18.960
There is everywhere. In Gita it is written

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:21.800
that you are born with your caste.

00:42:22.003 --> 00:42:25.600
Cannot be. Because the one who has written, Vyasa,

00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:29.760
was an illegitimate child of a fisherwoman.

00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:31.920
So there cannot be any caste like that.

00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:33.880
How can he say you are born as a brahmin?

00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:36.840
He cannot say, because he was not himself born as a brahmin.

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:39.735
But, you see, what happens,

00:42:39.936 --> 00:42:42.932
simple people start believing in all these things

00:42:43.133 --> 00:42:47.119
and start getting to them and misleading. They are very misleading,

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:50.039
they have organisations, they do all kinds of things,

00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:52.840
and they threaten you all the time, "If you don't do this,

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:55.720
you'll go to hell, this will happen, that will happen."

00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:58.314
And simple people just get frightened, you know,

00:42:58.515 --> 00:43:00.560
that, "Oh God, we'll go to hell now".

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:03.200
So they just say "All right, whatever you say we'll do".

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:05.216
Whatever they say they do it.

00:43:05.391 --> 00:43:07.674
In this, so many things like that,

00:43:07.875 --> 00:43:09.886
these gurus also taking full advantage, you see

00:43:10.087 --> 00:43:13.760
they make a big ado, "Now, come along,

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:17.540
we'll give you a, sort of a diksha, as they call it,

00:43:17.741 --> 00:43:19.167
it is enunciation.

00:43:19.368 --> 00:43:21.528
For that you have to go this way, that way,

00:43:21.729 --> 00:43:24.453
make a big drama out of it, befoul the people.

00:43:24.654 --> 00:43:26.480
Befouling is so much.

00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:29.880
Now, this TM is another befouling, very big befouling

00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:36.225
and gives you horrible things like epilepsy, horrible diseases.

00:43:36.426 --> 00:43:39.535
And some of the patients have come to me of AIDS from there -

00:43:39.736 --> 00:43:40.792
 it's surprising.

00:43:40.993 --> 00:43:43.864
But still people are going to it, I'm warning them openly,

00:43:44.065 --> 00:43:46.880
but I don't think they listen to Me.

00:43:47.188 --> 00:43:52.359
Now, this, she said the energies, you see,

00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:56.840
they put these black energies upon people and also entice them

00:43:57.120 --> 00:44:00.760
and also try to mesmerize them.

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:04.560
They are not aware of what they are doing, stupidly.

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:06.014
This is the thing is,

00:44:06.215 --> 00:44:08.707
because they are so simple, such good people.

00:44:08.908 --> 00:44:13.360
Say, when it's a white sari is very easy to spoil it, isn't it?

00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:17.200
But if it's a black one, it may not be spoiled so easily.

00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:22.520
That's what you are, simple people, simple hearted, good people.

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:25.240
Easily you catch on to these things.

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:29.280
Like in TM, they give mantras,

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:32.640
with such, three hundred pounds you have to pay.

00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:36.400
And she was saying is 900 dollars -

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:39.000
you have to pay just to get a mantra.

00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:41.680
And the mantra is what? Is "inga".

00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:46.280
"inga" means the tail of a scorpion.

00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:47.872
Just imagine!

00:44:48.048 --> 00:44:51.079
There is nothing like "inga" in Sanskrit language.

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:53.680
That's not there, this word is not there.

00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:57.120
Then they have to... he says that, "tinga".

00:44:57.320 --> 00:45:00.734
Tinga means showing it down like that - tinga.

00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:03.702
All such stupid words they have given,

00:45:03.903 --> 00:45:08.680
taking three hundred pounds from them - only for giving the words.

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:13.002
So what to do? Why people believe them?

00:45:13.203 --> 00:45:15.089
Is because they have big organisations,

00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:17.890
they have big buildings, big houses

00:45:18.091 --> 00:45:22.664
and they are very inviting and they do all kinds of things.

00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:29.438
M: Did you practice your Kundalini through an experience in your life?

00:45:30.137 --> 00:45:31.823
SY: Have you practiced?

00:45:32.024 --> 00:45:34.521
Experienced Kundalini movement? Kundalini?

00:45:34.722 --> 00:45:37.952
SM: Yes, I will just now. I'll move yours just now.

00:45:38.185 --> 00:45:40.525
M: Suppose somebody practice the Kundalini

00:45:40.726 --> 00:45:44.290
and moves the halfway, what happens to him? Who will be controlling?

00:45:44.491 --> 00:45:47.210
SM: No, no, no, it is all wrong idea

00:45:47.411 --> 00:45:50.035
because people who had no authority

00:45:50.236 --> 00:45:53.753
to put their hands to Kundalini have tried it - that's why.

00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:55.948
They have no business, they have no character,

00:45:56.149 --> 00:45:57.631
they have no authority from God.

00:45:57.832 --> 00:45:59.806
I have done this for thousands of people.

00:46:00.007 --> 00:46:02.440
Nobody has suffered, everybody has got it.

00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:05.480
Nothing happens, nothing goes wrong.

00:46:06.184 --> 00:46:07.625
It's not like that.

00:46:07.832 --> 00:46:11.121
B: Some people are liable to get...
SM: No one.

00:46:11.322 --> 00:46:12.948
SM: No one, no one.

00:46:13.149 --> 00:46:14.837
B: And do you think anybody can do...

00:46:15.038 --> 00:46:16.789
SM: That's your Mother, Sir.

00:46:16.990 --> 00:46:19.700
Now, a mother, when you were born

00:46:19.901 --> 00:46:25.269
took all your troubles of your birth upon herself.

00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:28.229
She didn't trouble you, did she?

00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:32.199
She's your individual Mother, how can She trouble you?

00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:35.422
This is all a myth and I think it's negative again,

00:46:35.623 --> 00:46:37.532
because they must have tried to frighten you

00:46:37.733 --> 00:46:39.362
that you don't get your Realization.

00:46:39.509 --> 00:46:41.079
That might be one of the reasons.

00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:43.560
Also I have seen books written - these people,

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:47.920
they have such bad vibrations - the one who have written the books.

00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:54.193
L: I want to ask You the question about spiritual places in the earth

00:46:54.394 --> 00:46:56.880
that are more powerful,

00:46:57.081 --> 00:47:01.152
the earth is more powerful, spiritual places which will help you

00:47:01.353 --> 00:47:04.159
become realized more faster or [does it matter still]?

00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:05.936
SY: Oh it's an interesting question.

00:47:06.137 --> 00:47:09.640
Are there places on earth which are more powerful,

00:47:09.841 --> 00:47:13.280
which will help you to get your Realization more quickly?

00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:17.919
Are there places of special qualities, special spiritual qualities?

00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:20.722
Shri Mataji: I don't know any.

00:47:21.590 --> 00:47:23.360
I can't mislead you, My child.

00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:25.520
SY: Swayambus?

00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:29.091
SM: You mean to, some places from the Mother Earth?

00:47:29.242 --> 00:47:31.342
L: No, no...

00:47:31.703 --> 00:47:37.441
Some [unclear] around the world evidently, [unclear].

00:47:37.659 --> 00:47:39.960
SM: Some organisations?

00:47:42.938 --> 00:47:46.040
Ah yes, yes, that kind there, that's true, that is all right.

00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:48.600
I thought you are saying some organisations.

00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:52.080
Of course, the Mother Earth has created so many points like that.

00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:54.080
She has made so many points

00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:58.800
which do emit vibrations, no doubt about it. She has.

00:48:00.193 --> 00:48:03.521
L: When the Kundalini has been awakened,

00:48:04.285 --> 00:48:06.771
anything blocks it on,

00:48:06.972 --> 00:48:08.493
or makes it stop?

00:48:08.694 --> 00:48:10.877
Once the Kundalini has been...

00:48:11.078 --> 00:48:13.178
SM: Raised, yes.

00:48:13.330 --> 00:48:15.119
L: Can it be stoped or blocked?

00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:18.258
SM: It does sometimes get blocked, not doubt about it

00:48:18.459 --> 00:48:20.880
but we can clear it - it's not so difficult.

00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:24.720
We can clear it - it's not so difficult to clear it.

00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:27.120
There's nothing to worry about.

00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:30.160
You can yourself clear it, anybody can clear it.

00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:33.120
No problem, it's a simple thing.

00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:36.760
B: You've made a statement earlier this evening

00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:39.640
that this is the age of Aquarius.

00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:42.520
This is the first time that I've heard

00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:46.800
it said in a very simple way.

00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:50.027
However, it was indicated

00:48:50.228 --> 00:48:53.599
that the middle of the next century

00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:59.160
is the limitation of the achievement.

00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:01.635
The question I would like to ask is:

00:49:01.842 --> 00:49:03.559
as far as I'm concerned,

00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:08.200
I'll probably won't see the middle of the next century.

00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:12.240
I'm not asking you to be,

00:49:15.321 --> 00:49:19.019
what should I say, a fortune teller in that context,

00:49:19.671 --> 00:49:22.931
but rather what I would like to know is,

00:49:23.132 --> 00:49:24.906
if I can't see it,

00:49:25.097 --> 00:49:29.853
is there anything that you are able to indicate

00:49:30.054 --> 00:49:34.840
as to what is going to happen after the middle of the next century?

00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:40.240
SY: He draws attention to the fact that the age of Aquarius

00:49:40.441 --> 00:49:43.480
is really at a sort of climax,

00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:45.640
is really moving in the middle of next century.

00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:48.960
SM: This is... Aquarius is Kundalini, Aquarius is the kumba, you see

00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:51.964
is the kumba, is the... Aquarius,

00:49:52.163 --> 00:49:54.207
in Sanskrit language is kumba,

00:49:54.408 --> 00:49:57.680
and in your language is the water carrier.

00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:00.280
Isn't it? It's a translated term.

00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:03.280
That is the triangular bone within us.

00:50:03.811 --> 00:50:06.640
And this is the age of Aquarius, no doubt about.

00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:10.920
No doubt, this is the age of Kundalini, is the Aquarius, is true.

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:16.800
In sanskrit is it called as kumba, kumba is the...

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.920
in the kumba the Kundalini is placed there, within us.

00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:24.600
This is the, of course, is the time of Aquarius, no doubt.

00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:27.331
You see, so many people have predicted.

00:50:27.532 --> 00:50:30.106
But I don't know, people cannot locate it

00:50:30.307 --> 00:50:33.594
or they're still in the dark, they just do not know.

00:50:33.769 --> 00:50:36.079
And

00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:40.757
I think next century we'll have beautiful people all around us,

00:50:40.958 --> 00:50:43.800
no, no troubles of wars,

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:47.880
very peaceful we'll be all sitting in the kingdom of God.

00:50:48.267 --> 00:50:51.050
SY: And you could be there in next lifetime if not this.

00:50:51.297 --> 00:50:53.182
B: Why talk of that?

00:50:55.171 --> 00:50:57.932
I'm not ashamed, I don't have the idea.

00:50:58.318 --> 00:50:59.809
SY: It's a question over here?

00:51:00.010 --> 00:51:01.602
L: Can You tell me, how it's possible

00:51:01.803 --> 00:51:04.639
feeling oneself through the fingertips?

00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:06.960
SY: She'd like a little more information

00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:10.182
about feeling oneself through the fingertips.

00:51:10.825 --> 00:51:13.600
SM: First of all you must get your Realization, all right?

00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:16.520
But still I can show you here as they have shown it.

00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:19.720
There are seven chakras, like one,

00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:22.640
two, three, four, five, six and seven.

00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:26.280
Now they're shown there. Now the first chakra is shown here,

00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:28.760
the red chakra is the first chakra and

00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:31.520
then the second chakra is shown here

00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:34.840
you see. And this one is the Vishuddhi what we call,

00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:38.880
is the chakra there, the throat, here, this.

00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:45.120
And this one is the, on the navel, Nabhi

00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:47.360
and third one is the Agnya chakra,

00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:49.360
is the chakra here, of Christ, here.

00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:52.840
And then we have the last chakra, is the Sahasrara

00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:56.600
is the thousand petals lotus in the brain,

00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:59.480
around the limbic area. That's the limbic area.

00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:02.625
The Kundalini passes through all these chakras,

00:52:02.826 --> 00:52:04.900
through the parasympathetic nervous system

00:52:05.101 --> 00:52:09.761
and pierces through the fontanel bone area from the limbic area.

00:52:10.041 --> 00:52:14.649
L: Mother, you are saying (one's chakras) are going to be feed...

00:52:14.850 --> 00:52:17.615
SY: "Feel", "feel" not "feed".

00:52:17.816 --> 00:52:19.180
She thought You said "feed".

00:52:19.381 --> 00:52:24.376
SM: No, no, no, I said "feel". I said: f, e, e, l - feel. All right?

00:52:24.575 --> 00:52:26.830
L: She's said, she asked the question

00:52:27.005 --> 00:52:29.314
"You said that's the Self Realization, Mother,

00:52:29.515 --> 00:52:34.318
then what about when you only feel that energy it's in your hands?

00:52:34.524 --> 00:52:36.280
I know a lot of people

00:52:36.481 --> 00:52:39.178
get very, very contact with the energy in their hands.

00:52:39.379 --> 00:52:42.356
Now, You say that these people are realized people already?

00:52:42.557 --> 00:52:45.269
SY: She's wondering about people who already feel

00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:48.515
these energies in the hand. Are they already realized?

00:52:48.716 --> 00:52:51.440
SM: Cool, cool. They should feel cool vibrations, cool vibrations,

00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:54.560
then they are already, their Kundalini is awakened.

00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:57.299
So such people should know what it is, you see.

00:52:57.500 --> 00:52:59.289
There are many people who are realized souls

00:52:59.490 --> 00:53:01.996
who are born as realized souls but they don't know what it is,

00:53:02.197 --> 00:53:03.393
they don't know how to use it.

00:53:03.594 --> 00:53:06.849
They must know everything, isn't it? Is important.

00:53:08.636 --> 00:53:10.680
SY: Do a lot of realised souls now living?

00:53:10.881 --> 00:53:13.384
SM: Yes, I mean, at least many children I have seen

00:53:13.585 --> 00:53:15.416
are born realized children,

00:53:15.617 --> 00:53:18.115
many children are and they put their fingers to show

00:53:18.316 --> 00:53:20.470
this is catching, that is catching of their parents.

00:53:20.671 --> 00:53:22.570
And sometimes when the parents come before Me,

00:53:22.771 --> 00:53:25.443
they jump on their back, try to correct their Kundalinis.

00:53:25.644 --> 00:53:29.680
Yes, it's true, children, many children are born realised, nowadays.

00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:33.761
SY: Last question. There's new, a new one.

00:53:36.254 --> 00:53:41.497
B: I, I am very sad but [what You say it's] karma yoga

00:53:41.709 --> 00:53:46.238
but yoga is not possible

00:53:46.439 --> 00:53:50.122
for us, for a lot of people - only for saints.

00:53:50.289 --> 00:53:53.258
The only yoga that is possible is karma yoga.

00:53:53.441 --> 00:53:55.062
SY: The only?

00:53:55.263 --> 00:53:57.341
SM: Karma yoga.
B: Karma yoga, yes.

00:53:57.524 --> 00:54:00.719
Now, I say it is possible

00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:03.292
and it is verily possible.

00:54:03.493 --> 00:54:07.160
And the karma part of it, when the Kundalini moves,

00:54:07.361 --> 00:54:09.719
She awakenes this centre of Christ.

00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:13.520
Now we said that Christ has died for our sins, isnt' it?

00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:18.206
He sucks in, he sucks in that yellow stuff

00:54:18.407 --> 00:54:21.920
which is our karmas, you see - it is the ego part of it.

00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:24.836
That is sucked in - then if you are no more there

00:54:25.037 --> 00:54:27.371
who does the karmas?

00:54:32.711 --> 00:54:36.160
When your ego is not there, who does the karmas?

00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:39.240
Then you start talking in third person -

00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:41.029
you come into akarmas.

00:54:41.230 --> 00:54:43.988
You start saying: "Mother, it's not moving,

00:54:44.189 --> 00:54:45.818
it's not coming", you say like that.

00:54:46.019 --> 00:54:48.600
You don't say, "I'm not doing it". You say, "It's not coming" -

00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:50.566
in the third person you start talking.

00:54:50.767 --> 00:54:53.663
It becomes akarma, as described in the Gita,

00:54:53.838 --> 00:54:55.839
it becomes akarma.

00:54:56.040 --> 00:55:00.160
They will go on saying like this because they can't do it.

00:55:02.308 --> 00:55:04.432
SY: Perhaps Realization now, Mother?

00:55:04.633 --> 00:55:08.453
Perhaps Realization now, Mother? SM: All right.

00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:15.279
Now there is a simple thing you have to do,

00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:17.160
little bit to cooperate with Me,

00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:19.400
is first of all we have to take out our shoes,

00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:21.830
to take the help of the Mother Earth - that's all.

00:55:22.031 --> 00:55:25.551
Because we have to take the help of all the...

00:55:38.056 --> 00:55:40.735
But it is going to work out.

00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:45.720
The first thing is, you have to forgive yourself.

00:55:47.088 --> 00:55:50.319
and you have to be in a very pleasant mood.

00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:52.893
First of all, you must forgive yourself,

00:55:53.094 --> 00:55:56.083
whatever mistakes you have committed, whatever wrong you have done,

00:55:56.274 --> 00:55:58.504
 don't count them.

00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:02.360
So you are not guilty at all of anything.

00:56:02.944 --> 00:56:04.291
That you must remember;

00:56:04.497 --> 00:56:07.287
because that is not the mood

00:56:07.488 --> 00:56:10.622
in which you should enter the kingdom of God.

00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:13.235
So you should know that now,

00:56:13.418 --> 00:56:15.471
there is no guilt in you,

00:56:15.672 --> 00:56:18.440
nothing has been done wrong by you.

00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:21.644
Don't curse yourself, don't blame yourself,

00:56:21.811 --> 00:56:23.438
don't say that you are wrong,

00:56:23.639 --> 00:56:28.280
you have done this wrong and that wrong and you go on counting them.

00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:31.613
That would help you a lot if you just say

00:56:31.814 --> 00:56:34.603
that, "Mother, I am not guilty".

00:56:34.786 --> 00:56:36.981
That's all you have to say, within yourself.

00:56:37.182 --> 00:56:40.560
With full confidence you have to say, "Mother, I am not guilty".

00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:43.720
Then I am going to teach you how to raise your own Kundalini

00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:46.326
because she asked the question if it stops and all that.

00:56:46.527 --> 00:56:48.959
It's very simple how to raise your own Kundalini

00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:50.470
so even if it stops,

00:56:50.671 --> 00:56:53.466
you can go on raising it again and again and it will work out.

00:56:53.667 --> 00:56:56.859
You will yourself raise the Kundalini today.

00:56:57.200 --> 00:56:58.960
But I'll tell you how to do it.

00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:01.880
You have to put your left hand towards Me like this.

00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:05.400
Now left hand, I couldn't tell you in the whole lecture today...

00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:09.280
Just like this, on your lap, just like this, on your lap.

00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:15.080
I didn't tell in your lecture today...  I think I should stand up,

00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:19.481
it would be better for the backside people to see.

00:57:21.296 --> 00:57:23.816
Now you can see Me?

00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:46.080
You put your left hand towards Me like this, just like this.

00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:48.120
Be comfortable, be comfortable.

00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:50.440
Those who are sitting can put it on their laps just.

00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:53.920
This is to symbolize or to say

00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:58.200
that this is the power of desire.

00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:02.054
This is what you are desiring, to have Realization,

00:58:02.255 --> 00:58:04.079
that's why putting the hand towards Me.

00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:06.824
This is just the power of desire.

00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:13.080
This is the hand that does the action so it has the power of action.

00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:17.200
So this is the hand we are going to use for raising our Kundalini.

00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:20.000
But we are going to work only on the left hand side.

00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:23.200
First I'll tell you. Keep your eyes open and see for yourself.

00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:27.120
First only, this left hand will be towards Me,

00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:30.160
right hand on the heart.

00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:34.080
Then,

00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:37.322
it goes down in the upper part of your abdomen.

00:58:37.529 --> 00:58:39.359
Press it there.

00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:41.920
There's a centre, on the left hand side,

00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:45.440
there's a centre within us, on the left hand side, here.

00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:47.328
Then put it down here,

00:58:47.511 --> 00:58:50.222
on the lower part of the abdomen and press it there.

00:58:50.423 --> 00:58:52.760
There's another centre there.

00:58:53.480 --> 00:58:57.327
Then you come back again onto the upper part of the abdomen,

00:58:57.528 --> 00:59:00.640
there's a centre there - very important centre.

00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:05.740
And from this centre you come back to the heart.

00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:11.679
Now from here you have to go to the centre which is placed between,

00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:13.760
this we call as left Vishuddhi,

00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:16.549
between you neck and your shoulder here and

00:59:16.750 --> 00:59:22.200
turn your face towards right, like this.

00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:30.360
for a while. here is the centre is caught up when you are guilty.

00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:32.919
That's why I said you should not feel guilty at all.

00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:37.586
After that, you have to open your hand

00:59:37.784 --> 00:59:41.784
and put it on your forehead and press it hard,

00:59:42.165 --> 00:59:43.880
on both the sides.

00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:45.840
This is the centre of Christ.

00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:48.161
Then you have to go back

00:59:48.362 --> 00:59:53.173
and put your hand on the backside of your head

00:59:53.374 --> 00:59:56.999
and push it back, like that. Let it rest there.

00:59:57.200 --> 01:00:00.960
Now, you have to stretch your hand

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:04.560
and in the centre of your hand, here,

01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:08.800
you put this on top of the fontanel bone area,

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:12.200
which was the soft bone when you were a child.

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:17.049
Put it there and press it hard, the scalp,

01:00:17.250 --> 01:00:20.473
pressing out the fingers,

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:24.440
seven times, slowly. That's all.

01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:28.159
And that's how you get your Realization. It's very simple.

01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:31.280
Now let's do it again, with closed eyes.

01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:34.000
Will you please take out your spectacles?

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:37.141
Because it helps your eyesight also.

01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:41.120
You shouldn't open your eyes till I tell you,

01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:43.480
so you won't need your spectacles at all.

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:46.400
Anybody who is feeling uncomfortable here

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:49.560
or in the neck or anything, can loosen it a little bit.

01:00:49.761 --> 01:00:53.910
So to feel absolutely, absolutely clear-cut.

01:00:54.111 --> 01:00:56.384
Now, there's nothing to worry,

01:00:56.559 --> 01:00:58.696
it has not happened anything to anyone.

01:00:58.897 --> 01:01:02.520
Everybody will feel very much better. All right.

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:07.760
New Zealand people are really beautiful the way

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:10.480
they are anxious to get their Realization.

01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:13.680
So very happy to meet them, really.

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:15.959
Isn't it?

01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:18.165
All right. Now, left hand towards Me.

01:01:18.351 --> 01:01:20.864
This you should not move. Keep the left hand towards Me.

01:01:21.065 --> 01:01:23.584
You can keep it on your lap, if you find it comfortable

01:01:23.785 --> 01:01:25.520
on your lap or any way.

01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:27.080
Now, the right hand.

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:29.754
Before putting the right hand, you close your eyes now.

01:01:29.955 --> 01:01:32.840
Close your eyes. Take out your spectacles - is better.

01:01:33.041 --> 01:01:34.537
Take out your spectacles,

01:01:34.738 --> 01:01:39.840
because it might make you feel little awkward or maybe...

01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:43.000
Put it on your heart. Now, close your eyes.

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:46.079
Please don't open your eyes till I tell you.

01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:49.960
Now here, is a very important question you have to ask Me

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:53.120
because here resides the Spirit.

01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:56.800
So you ask Me a question three times, "Mother,

01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:01.440
am I, am I the Spirit?"

01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:07.160
You can call Me Shri Mataji if possible

01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:09.160
or call Me Mother, that's easier.

01:02:09.361 --> 01:02:12.240
Mother, am I the Spirit?

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:15.920
Three times. Is very important question, in your heart.

01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:18.760
Ask this question in your heart.

01:02:22.616 --> 01:02:25.679
Put your hand on your heart. Right hand on your heart.

01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:30.646
Right hand on your heart, yes, on your heart, on your heart, yes.

01:02:30.847 --> 01:02:32.959
Please keep your eyes shut.

01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:36.639
Now, move the right hand. Left hand as it is,

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:41.374
right hand in the upper part of the abdomen, on the left hand side,

01:02:41.575 --> 01:02:43.786
upper part of the abdomen.

01:02:44.638 --> 01:02:47.600
Now, is very good.

01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:50.560
Now, this is the centre of your mastery.

01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:52.855
All the prophets who came on this earth

01:02:53.056 --> 01:02:55.538
have established this centre for you

01:02:55.721 --> 01:02:59.920
so that you can master - you become a master of yourself.

01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:03.000
So now, ask a question to Me, second question,

01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:05.446
"Mother, am I my own master?".

01:03:05.647 --> 01:03:07.657
Ask Me a question, three times,

01:03:07.848 --> 01:03:10.871
"Mother, am I my own master?"

01:03:28.624 --> 01:03:30.636
Take down your right hand

01:03:30.837 --> 01:03:34.040
in the lower part of the abdomen and press it hard.

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:39.160
This is the centre through which we work out the divine laws,

01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:41.840
one of the most important centre that way.

01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:44.880
So now here you have to ask Me -

01:03:45.081 --> 01:03:49.022
because I cannot force you to get it - you have to ask Me.

01:03:49.223 --> 01:03:51.240
So please ask Me six times

01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:53.640
because this centre has got six petals,

01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:57.360
"Mother, may I have pure knowledge?".

01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:01.008
"Mother, may I have pure knowledge?"

01:04:01.199 --> 01:04:03.953
Pure knowledge.

01:04:11.545 --> 01:04:13.448
Is good.

01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:15.800
Six times, please.

01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:33.080
Now, raise this hand again up,

01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:37.793
on the left side of your abdomen,

01:04:38.768 --> 01:04:41.848
on the upper part of it. Now press it here.

01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:44.223
Now, as you have asked Me the question

01:04:44.398 --> 01:04:46.365
to give you the pure knowledge,

01:04:46.566 --> 01:04:48.257
the Kundalini has started moving.

01:04:48.458 --> 01:04:51.800
So now, at this point, so try to cooperate with the Kundalini

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.919
by saying, "Mother, I am my master".

01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:59.638
Please say it ten times, "Mother, I am my master".

01:04:59.839 --> 01:05:02.160
Please say it ten times.

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:06.440
"Mother, I am my master". Have faith in yourself.

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:11.040
With full confidence, please say, "Mother, I am my master".

01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:15.120
That's a fact.

01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:20.760
Ten times.

01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:34.160
Now, raise your hand to your heart.

01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:38.720
Here, with the self-confidence, full self-confidence

01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:42.680
you have to say, "Mother, I am the Spirit".

01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:45.800
This is twelve times, "Mother, I am the Spirit",

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:48.700
to make the Kundalini move faster upward.

01:05:48.901 --> 01:05:52.399
"Mother, I am the Spirit". This is the truth.

01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:54.960
The truth is you are the Spirit.

01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:57.960
"Mother, I am the Spirit".

01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:01.640
Say it twelve times, please.

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:05.714
Now, we have to know that God Almighty

01:06:05.897 --> 01:06:09.879
is the ocean of love and grace,

01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:13.959
but above all, He is the ocean of forgiveness.

01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:16.952
So, He forgives whatever mistakes we commit.

01:06:17.153 --> 01:06:20.399
After all, we are human beings so we commit mistakes.

01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:26.960
So it would be better that you raise your right hand, now,

01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:36.800
on your shoulder, between the corner of the shoulder and the neck

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:40.560
and put your head towards the right.

01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:43.760
Now, here, press it hard and say for,

01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:46.200
with full confidence in yourself,

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:49.160
"Mother, I am not guilty", sixteen times, please.

01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:51.360
Please say, "Mother, I am not guilty".

01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:52.964
As I have told you,

01:06:53.165 --> 01:06:57.560
you have to be absolutely pleasantly placed towards yourself.

01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:00.640
Now, those who still don't want to forgive themselves

01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:03.960
can say it 108 times to take the punishment.

01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:07.640
Put it on here.

01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:10.840
That's very important this centre is, very important.

01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:14.040
Put your head towards the right.

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:19.360
Good. Sixteen times.

01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:41.719
Now,

01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:46.280
raise your hand again to your forehead across

01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:48.037
and press it hard.

01:07:48.238 --> 01:07:54.880
Now, here, you have to say, "Mother, I forgive everyone, everyone".

01:07:55.400 --> 01:08:00.080
Now one should not think that it is difficult to forgive.

01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:05.975
After all, we forgive or not forgive, we do not do anything.

01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:08.240
But when we do not forgive

01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:12.669
then we are playing into the hands of wrong people.

01:08:12.870 --> 01:08:14.400
So better forgive.

01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:17.080
Everyone you forgive - don't count them.

01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:20.679
Forgive them from your heart, how many times is not the point.

01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:24.280
From your heart, just forgive them.

01:08:32.719 --> 01:08:35.076
It's very hot.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:40.280
Now, put the hand on the backside of your head.

01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:48.298
And now, place your hand on the backside

01:08:48.499 --> 01:08:50.825
and put the load of your head on that

01:08:51.026 --> 01:08:54.800
and now here, for your own satisfaction you can say,

01:08:55.001 --> 01:08:59.240
"Mother, if I have done any mistakes, please forgive me",

01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:02.195
or "Oh, Divine, if I have done any mistakes, please forgive me" -

01:09:02.396 --> 01:09:04.719
just for your own satisfaction.

01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:07.400
It's not necessary to say.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.920
Now, say it from your heart.

01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:20.605
Now, open your hands, properly.

01:09:22.016 --> 01:09:26.273
Put the hand on the top of the fontanel bone area, in the centre,

01:09:26.474 --> 01:09:31.433
press it hard and move it seven times, seven times.

01:09:31.634 --> 01:09:37.280
Here you have to ask Me for Self-Realization. I cannot force on you.

01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:39.400
So you have to say seven times

01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:42.096
"Mother, please give us Self-Realization".

01:09:42.297 --> 01:09:44.805
I cannot force on you.

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:39.843
May God bless you.

01:10:40.044 --> 01:10:44.560
Now take down your hand and open your eyes slowly.

01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:48.120
Now, put your right hand towards Me,

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:53.100
instead of the left and put your left hand on top of your head.

01:10:53.301 --> 01:10:54.393
And see for yourself,

01:10:54.594 --> 01:10:56.993
have you got the cool breeze coming out of your head?

01:10:57.194 --> 01:10:58.827
Put it on the fontanel; just move.

01:10:59.028 --> 01:11:02.304
Some people get it very high, some people get it very...

01:11:02.505 --> 01:11:07.197
Yes, it's there. Just keep it on this side, this side, here.

01:11:07.398 --> 01:11:11.480
You can bend your head and see if you want to - would be easier.

01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:19.040
Now, put the left hand towards Me

01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:21.240
and put the right hand and see for yourself

01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:24.520
if you got the cool breeze in your head.

01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:33.480
It's good.

01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:35.601
Now put again the right hand towards Me

01:11:35.802 --> 01:11:38.071
and see with the left hand.

01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:45.607
Now you can raise both the hands towards the sky

01:11:45.808 --> 01:11:47.527
and ask a question in your heart,

01:11:47.728 --> 01:11:49.730
"Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

01:11:49.931 --> 01:11:53.160
Holy Ghost is the Kundalini. Holy Ghost is the Kundalini.

01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:55.680
"Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?",

01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:59.800
"Is this the cool breeze of God's love?",

01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:02.280
"Is this the Paramachaitanya?"

01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:05.145
Just ask the question. Put the head back and ask the question,

01:12:05.346 --> 01:12:07.640
three times, any question you feel like.

01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:09.480
Three times.

01:12:13.592 --> 01:12:15.839
Now, bring it down.

01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:20.560
Now, see for yourself; you feel peaceful inside and relaxed.

01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:24.440
You watch Me without thinking. You can do it, very easily.

01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:27.333
Now, see.

01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:37.600
It's coming from you to Me. It's so great.

01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:40.751
Now, those who have felt

01:12:40.942 --> 01:12:44.516
cool breeze on top of their heads or in their hands,

01:12:44.717 --> 01:12:47.440
you have to raise both the hands - those who have felt it.

01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:50.160
Those who have felt cool breeze in the hands -

01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:52.640
higher up like that, just Me to see.

01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:55.110
Those who have felt cool breeze in their hands

01:12:55.311 --> 01:12:57.068
or on top of their hands,

01:12:57.269 --> 01:12:59.300
 should raise their hands.

01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:02.800
So many of you have felt it!

01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:04.769
What happened to your Aquarius?

01:13:04.970 --> 01:13:06.840
Didn't feel it? All right, we'll see about.

01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:09.071
Most of you have felt it.

01:13:09.272 --> 01:13:10.553
May God bless you.

01:13:10.754 --> 01:13:12.847
Those who didn't do it, would not feel. naturally.

01:13:13.048 --> 01:13:14.204
This lady didn't do anything

01:13:14.405 --> 01:13:17.159
so she would not feel anything. It's all right.

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:19.192
May God bless you.

01:13:21.272 --> 01:13:24.391
Now, you can just see this gentleman, what's the matter with him?

01:13:24.592 --> 01:13:27.160
One-two people should see, one or two people there I saw.

01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:30.000
You didn't feel the cool breeze? No? All right.

01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:32.730
So can you come out a little bit these boys, these can see.

01:13:32.931 --> 01:13:35.727
Now, just see him. He is outside.

01:13:37.765 --> 01:13:41.842
Niko, just, Niko here just see, this gentleman, didn't feel it.

01:13:42.043 --> 01:13:45.920
I'm sorry, but he should, he should. Yes, just you should feel it.

01:13:46.727 --> 01:13:49.687
Just see, what's the problem.

01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:59.800
Done now? Feeling peaceful and happy now?

01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:04.879
B: Which year did You meet Mahatma Gandhi?

01:14:05.726 --> 01:14:08.040
Which year were you with Mahatma Ghandi?

01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:10.787
SM: I was there with him from seven years of age.

01:14:10.994 --> 01:14:12.979
B: Which year? What year?

01:14:13.180 --> 01:14:15.180
SM: Must be 7...

01:14:15.403 --> 01:14:18.659

01:14:18.860 --> 01:14:21.040
B: 1930? 1930?

01:14:21.215 --> 01:14:23.381
SM: 1930.

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:28.240
Civil disobedience, civil disobedience's time, yes.

01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:32.680
My father was with him, mother was with him,

01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:34.440
the whole family.

01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:38.525
But specially Me, I lived with him, personally with him. Yes.

01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:42.320
You didn't feel on the head?

01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:45.040
Now, you just ask, "Mother come in my head".

01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:47.208
Just say that if you didn't feel in the (head).

01:14:47.383 --> 01:14:49.695
Just say that, it will come.

01:14:49.896 --> 01:14:51.761
Again.

01:14:53.959 --> 01:14:56.440
See it again.

01:14:57.982 --> 01:15:00.236
Now just see.

01:15:00.791 --> 01:15:02.781
There?

01:15:03.154 --> 01:15:06.760
It's there. Whatever you ask you'll get it.

01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:09.840
Now you got it madam. All of you. Very good.

01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:13.479
Now this gentleman, you just see, this. He should get it, actually.

01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:16.440
He's read too much I think.

01:15:16.757 --> 01:15:18.225
Devi, come along.

01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:21.007
Now you all can give Realization. You all can see.

01:15:21.208 --> 01:15:24.839
You can see each other's heads also. You can see each other head,

01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:26.733
to convince yourself.

01:15:26.934 --> 01:15:28.759
Just see what's her problem.

01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:30.833
I think Nabhi.

01:15:31.009 --> 01:15:34.254
Little liver problem he has. That's all.

01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:38.880
Ask him to put his left hand on the liver. That's all.

01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:43.600
Left hand on the liver. That side, that side.

01:15:43.992 --> 01:15:47.159
Yes, that side. Yes, that' it. And right hand towards Me. That' all.

01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:49.587
Now, see. Put both the feet on the...

01:15:49.770 --> 01:15:51.991
Yes, now see.

01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:54.896
They work out from the back.

01:15:55.095 --> 01:15:58.158
[Hindi/Marathi]

01:16:02.205 --> 01:16:05.765
To (then - in Hindi) balanced you? Are you imbalanced?

01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:11.948
Ask him what work he does.

01:16:12.149 --> 01:16:13.454
Give him a balance also.

01:16:13.637 --> 01:16:15.839
Give this gentleman a balance, he will be all right.

01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:18.960
Right sided. Just give him a balance. Left to the right.

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:21.880
Move it left to the right.

01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:29.600
You must forgive. Did you forgive, Sir?

01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:31.849
Did you really, from your heart?

01:16:32.555 --> 01:16:34.279
All right, then you must...

01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:37.080
Now, are you feeling the cool breeze?

01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:44.392
No?

01:16:44.638 --> 01:16:48.279
There is in the head. Little bit it has started. You will.

01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:51.631
Maybe, Vishuddhi may be wrong or something.

01:16:58.432 --> 01:17:00.857
All of them have got it.

01:17:01.033 --> 01:17:04.839
Now one has to laugh, that's all, and enjoy.

01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:08.280
Nothing to worry. You have entered into the Kingdom of God

01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:10.341
and you'll be surprised how you are helped.

01:17:10.542 --> 01:17:12.019
Everything is over now.

01:17:12.220 --> 01:17:13.780
The one who didn't get there.

01:17:13.981 --> 01:17:18.036
Somebody... Can you come down to this side, my child? This side.

01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:21.320
Come this side, this side.

01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:25.041
If you can get out and come out, will be good idea.

01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:30.217
No, no, she is coming, David she is coming this side.

01:17:30.418 --> 01:17:31.916
Now, where are others?

01:17:32.107 --> 01:17:34.319
Mary, you see her.

01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:36.872
Or someone? You need to balance her.

01:17:37.071 --> 01:17:38.939
Just, she will see you.

01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:42.110
This gentleman with the...

01:17:46.472 --> 01:17:48.839
Have you been to any guru or anyone?

01:17:49.030 --> 01:17:51.425
No one so far?

01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:57.336
You, did you feel now?

01:17:57.537 --> 01:18:01.613
In the head they did feel, but in the hands did not.

01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:05.200
Because this center is little bit heavy.

01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:08.120
It will loosen out. But in the head they have felt it.

01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:11.480
You can feel it on his head madam, you yourself.

01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:15.037
You, you can feel it, the neighbor, yes you can feel it.

01:18:15.220 --> 01:18:17.204
Just see.

01:18:19.312 --> 01:18:21.573
Is it there?

01:18:24.831 --> 01:18:26.498
Now?

01:18:26.657 --> 01:18:28.744
Not yet?

01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:54.560
Some people might feel the heat. That's all right doesn't matter,

01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:56.880
the heat will be replaced by the cool breeze.

01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:59.217
But first the heat can come into some people.

01:18:59.408 --> 01:19:03.383
No? You were busy with the child.
