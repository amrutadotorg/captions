00:00:00.632 --> 00:00:06.828
On seeing the depth of your love, My heart feels overwhelmed.

00:00:06.853 --> 00:00:17.561
In this Kaliyuga, it is very difficult to recognize Mother

00:00:17.586 --> 00:00:20.430
because we don't recognize our Mother

00:00:20.455 --> 00:00:25.193
so, it becomes all the more difficult to recognize Me.

00:00:25.218 --> 00:00:34.806
But the depth of this land of BENGAL is working in you.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.190
So, I observe that

00:00:38.214 --> 00:00:43.837
any Sahajyogi, who comes from this place, goes deep, gets deeper.

00:00:43.862 --> 00:00:45.758
He goes very deep.

00:00:45.782 --> 00:00:53.341
And it is so surprising, that the places where I did a lot of work

00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:58.429
there the people are many, but they are not so deep.

00:00:58.453 --> 00:01:03.742
And the collectivity among them is not as beautiful as it is here.

00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:09.882
The speciality, of Bang bhumi, I say, is

00:01:09.907 --> 00:01:13.760
that the collectivity and love for each other

00:01:13.785 --> 00:01:19.171
if we look at it, is absolutely selfless and unselfish.

00:01:19.196 --> 00:01:24.596
On seeing all this, you dont know how happy I am!

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:31.171
And I wish that your work may progress much more

00:01:31.196 --> 00:01:34.160
and spread among the masses.

00:01:34.184 --> 00:01:40.536
Because you know that, this land is very much dear to Mother.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.975
You had told that today, Saraswati Puja will be performed.

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:46.325
It is absolutely necessary

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:51.124
that in Bang Desh, Saraswati should be worshiped.

00:01:51.148 --> 00:01:53.719
Because of Devi’s blessings only

00:01:53.744 --> 00:02:00.269
and because of Her sacrifice, this land is SASHYA - SHYAMALAM

00:02:00.294 --> 00:02:02.540
such fertile and green.

00:02:02.565 --> 00:02:12.705
But the reason why poverty and the suffering is here

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:15.660
that whatever the worship of Saraswati has been done

00:02:15.685 --> 00:02:21.878
was very limited (NOT CLEAR).

00:02:21.903 --> 00:02:26.567
People did not pray Mahasarawati, only Saraswati has been worshipped

00:02:26.592 --> 00:02:30.231
in which we can encourage artistic talents

00:02:30.358 --> 00:02:34.982
or, we can become scholars.

00:02:35.007 --> 00:02:37.327
From this place the scholars are one better than the other

00:02:37.351 --> 00:02:38.666
Many scientists have evolved  from here.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:49.611
People have progressed a lot in the field of education

00:02:49.635 --> 00:02:51.403
compared to people from other places.

00:02:51.428 --> 00:02:55.785
People from here are very intelligent and are very matured.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.101
Inspite of all this, why there is still poverty here?

00:02:59.126 --> 00:03:05.031
We should come up with a formula

00:03:05.056 --> 00:03:07.828
as to why there is so much of poverty is here?

00:03:07.852 --> 00:03:14.393
Why do we have in a way, jealosy within us?

00:03:14.418 --> 00:03:18.442
That if someone gets some money, we are are jealous of him.

00:03:18.466 --> 00:03:23.020
By being jealous of him or hatred, poverty will not go away.

00:03:23.045 --> 00:03:25.746
For that we need to understand

00:03:25.771 --> 00:03:32.144
what is it we are lacking, that we need to overcome.

00:03:32.168 --> 00:03:33.311
Saraswati you know that

00:03:33.335 --> 00:03:39.273
as per Sahaja Yoga, the work of Maha Saraswati is on the right side.

00:03:39.298 --> 00:03:44.094
When She works on the Swadishthan chakra

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:49.043
and when the Swadishthan chakra moves towards the left,

00:03:49.068 --> 00:03:53.064
then all the artistic talents are developed.

00:03:53.088 --> 00:03:55.981
The music here is fantastic.

00:03:56.005 --> 00:04:03.535
And there is no field of art that is not there in Bengal.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.586
In everything, even in movies, in dramas

00:04:08.611 --> 00:04:14.820
every art field like, dance, music, sculpture

00:04:14.845 --> 00:04:18.193
in everything, Bang Desh is very famous.

00:04:18.217 --> 00:04:20.765
Nowhere else, you will find artists better than them.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.169
You tell them any small thing, they will immediately do it.

00:04:25.194 --> 00:04:29.560
The gold jewelly designers here, are also very famous.

00:04:29.584 --> 00:04:34.893
It is because they have reached that state of art, of fine art.

00:04:34.918 --> 00:04:41.017
The fne form of art, which is famous and accepted all over the world.

00:04:41.042 --> 00:04:46.632
It is in a way created such

00:04:46.657 --> 00:04:52.999
that you can see lot of like Divine Light in it.

00:04:53.031 --> 00:04:58.153
You cannot see the Divine Light in it, but it is full of vibrations.

00:04:58.178 --> 00:05:01.284
Anything that is created very beautifully

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:10.111
and recognised all over the world, is aesthetically rich.

00:05:10.136 --> 00:05:13.729
If you put your hands towards it

00:05:13.753 --> 00:05:17.346
you will feel vibrations flowing from it.

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:18.748
There will be vibrations flowing from it.

00:05:18.773 --> 00:05:27.432
If a Realized person makes a sculpture or any art form

00:05:27.456 --> 00:05:32.202
from that you can  feel the vibrations flowing.

00:05:32.226 --> 00:05:38.786
The reason is that people who live here are very devotional.

00:05:38.811 --> 00:05:44.540
The people are deep from within and take any art form of this place.

00:05:44.565 --> 00:05:49.354
There is nowhere in the world that it is not liked

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:53.222
or liked by people, appreaciated .

00:05:53.247 --> 00:05:55.410
There is no such art form, from Bengal

00:05:55.434 --> 00:06:02.205
whether it is, painting, even cinema, dance, that is not appreaciated.

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:04.415
They say that people of Bengal are perfectionist

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:06.581
who have achieved totality.

00:06:06.605 --> 00:06:10.422
When we have progressed on one side (of Swadishthan)

00:06:10.446 --> 00:06:15.387
we have not used the other side of Swadishthan.

00:06:15.411 --> 00:06:19.672
Even when we use the other side of Swadishtan

00:06:19.697 --> 00:06:29.546
that too we think, we use it only for reading, writing and such things.

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:34.333
We have not paid attention to a state higher than this.

00:06:34.358 --> 00:06:38.485
That is why now a days, there is imbalance.

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:40.693
If you look at it, it is a very accomplished place.

00:06:40.717 --> 00:06:42.900
So much of art, literature, everything is there

00:06:42.925 --> 00:06:46.180
and whatever the problems here are

00:06:46.205 --> 00:06:50.689
and people say that the union of Saraswati and Lakshmi takes place.

00:06:50.714 --> 00:06:55.840
It is right that there may be no union between Saraswati and Lakshmi

00:06:55.865 --> 00:06:59.335
but the union can be achieved in Mahasaraswati.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.667
Being in unision with Mahasaraswati means that

00:07:02.691 --> 00:07:08.124
whatever you are doing there

00:07:08.149 --> 00:07:11.052
you go to the deeper aspect and start thinking.

00:07:11.076 --> 00:07:17.197
After all, what is the reason that there is no union with Lakshmi?

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.901
Why there is no union with Mahalaxmi?

00:07:20.926 --> 00:07:28.193
In Sahaja Yoga, both meet at the Agnya chakra and is (NOT CLEAR)

00:07:28.218 --> 00:07:36.925
Because, if you look at the action part, it is tremendous

00:07:36.949 --> 00:07:43.275
but you do not get the result that you desire.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:49.523
If you come into Agyna chakra, you start thinking.

00:07:49.548 --> 00:07:54.902
Why, till now, we have not got that state?

00:07:54.966 --> 00:07:58.135
which so many artists have got

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:03.432
that totality which other enlightened people have been granted?

00:08:03.456 --> 00:08:07.047
and why are we living in poverty?”

00:08:07.071 --> 00:08:09.503
What we need to understand is that

00:08:09.527 --> 00:08:17.179
till we do not reach that state where we see both aspects

00:08:17.203 --> 00:08:20.378
till then, we cannot progress.

00:08:20.402 --> 00:08:26.742
To unite art with Lakshmi we need balanced vision.

00:08:26.766 --> 00:08:31.701
So,One of our greatest weaknesses within us is

00:08:31.726 --> 00:08:37.239
it is said about Bengalis, is stubbornness. They are very stubborn.

00:08:37.264 --> 00:08:40.012
Suppose they take to some art form

00:08:40.037 --> 00:08:44.179
like if they have made an elephant, they will go on making elephants.

00:08:44.203 --> 00:08:47.121
If they make a horse, they go on making horses.

00:08:47.146 --> 00:08:49.004
If they like a particular type of music

00:08:49.029 --> 00:08:51.312
they will go on singing in the same way.

00:08:51.337 --> 00:08:55.195
If you tell them to change it

00:08:55.219 --> 00:08:57.428
they will immediately get angry.

00:08:57.453 --> 00:09:00.341
They feel that their art is not respected at all.

00:09:00.365 --> 00:09:06.544
At Agnya Chakra, if you contemplate, the stubbornness catches Agnya.

00:09:06.568 --> 00:09:15.864
“We are Bengalis. We have the greatest artists, intellectuals”.

00:09:15.889 --> 00:09:17.195
By taking the names of great artists

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.109
they think that they are also great.

00:09:19.133 --> 00:09:23.387
It is not true, you need to understand.

00:09:23.411 --> 00:09:27.805
If you look at them, you will know that they are not stubborn at all

00:09:27.829 --> 00:09:32.051
But you are stubborn when you say that,'We are great people

00:09:32.103 --> 00:09:34.665
because we have such great people from Bang Desh.

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:37.188
Thinking like that you cannot reach that level

00:09:37.213 --> 00:09:44.501
but yes, you can live in the shadow of their glory.

00:09:44.525 --> 00:09:48.726
But if you want to rise above that, we should give up stubbornnes.

00:09:48.751 --> 00:09:51.297
'we are like this only’, 'we will continue to be like this’

00:09:51.321 --> 00:09:53.490
'we will not do anything more than this’

00:09:53.514 --> 00:09:57.189
'and we will not compromise with our style’.

00:09:57.213 --> 00:09:59.196
That is not possible.

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:02.467
By compromising, I am not telling that you destroy the art.

00:10:02.491 --> 00:10:05.673
Don’t have to destroy the art in any manner.

00:10:05.697 --> 00:10:11.255
But you must think of art, in a balanced manner.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:14.600
I am telling you something practical.

00:10:14.624 --> 00:10:18.354
One is the laziness within us

00:10:18.378 --> 00:10:20.862
that laziness too leads to stubbornness.

00:10:20.887 --> 00:10:25.443
When a person starts becoming lazy, he also becomes very stubborn.

00:10:25.467 --> 00:10:30.407
He does not think that I am stubborn because of laziness.

00:10:30.432 --> 00:10:34.205
Because, for learning something new, I have to make an effort.

00:10:34.229 --> 00:10:38.980
But something that I already know, I can do effortlessly.

00:10:39.004 --> 00:10:43.622
But Mataji was saying, Just make some changes, it will be alright.

00:10:43.647 --> 00:10:45.606
That I cannot do.

00:10:45.631 --> 00:10:50.165
In this, one thing is stubborness and behind that is laziness.

00:10:50.189 --> 00:10:55.874
We are slow at learning anything new, because of  being slow learners.

00:10:55.898 --> 00:10:58.331
And because of this slow speed

00:10:58.355 --> 00:11:01.027
we cannot learn new things

00:11:01.052 --> 00:11:05.717
which can definitely give us the blessings of Lakshmi.

00:11:05.742 --> 00:11:09.680
For example, I went to an organization, where I said

00:11:09.705 --> 00:11:13.275
Tell the Bengalis that the purses you make

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:15.390
don’t make it so elaborate.

00:11:15.415 --> 00:11:19.439
Make it in a single line, then people will like it very much.

00:11:19.463 --> 00:11:23.335
This is not possible, we cannot do this.

00:11:23.359 --> 00:11:25.123
we will continue to make the same way

00:11:25.147 --> 00:11:27.230
we cannot make it the way you are saying.

00:11:27.255 --> 00:11:29.776
we cannot make it the way you are saying.

00:11:29.801 --> 00:11:32.435
You cannot give any suggestion.

00:11:32.459 --> 00:11:34.833
They will continue to make in the same elaborate manner.

00:11:34.858 --> 00:11:37.522
You may keep in stock twenty five articles ready

00:11:37.546 --> 00:11:38.822
and it will not be sold.

00:11:38.846 --> 00:11:41.006
They will say, We have the stock.

00:11:41.031 --> 00:11:43.000
It is alright if it is not sold, we have the stock.

00:11:43.025 --> 00:11:45.867
They continue to be proud of it.

00:11:45.892 --> 00:11:49.456
There must be an understanding.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:56.109
Now in Sahaja Yoga, your brains open up, it opens up completely.

00:11:56.134 --> 00:11:59.831
His Agnya opens out. First of all the stubborness reduces.

00:11:59.856 --> 00:12:02.222
I will insist that this is the only way to do it

00:12:02.247 --> 00:12:04.181
and there is no other right way.

00:12:04.206 --> 00:12:06.574
Whatever i do is only right.

00:12:06.599 --> 00:12:09.164
You can benefit, once you give up the stubborness.

00:12:09.188 --> 00:12:15.246
Like I have seen in many people, they have different type of qualities.

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:19.201
But in that stubbornness, it is all lost in stubborness.

00:12:19.225 --> 00:12:23.157
It can have a very great effect on a person's entire life.

00:12:23.181 --> 00:12:26.825
We are like this only and will remain so.

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:36.272
No, we should change, and this change can be achieved very easily in Sahaja.

00:12:36.296 --> 00:12:40.917
When you get it in Sahaj way then you will be surprised that

00:12:40.942 --> 00:12:44.161
it is in Sahaj way only, that the union with Laxmi can be achieved.

00:12:44.185 --> 00:12:47.217
I have seen this expecially in the artists that

00:12:47.242 --> 00:12:51.621
they are so stubborn that if you tell them

00:12:51.646 --> 00:12:53.466
Please make this small change.

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:55.002
They’ll say, No, we will not change it.

00:12:55.026 --> 00:12:57.802
Only this suits us and we will stick to it.

00:12:57.827 --> 00:13:00.374
Even if the people who are listening get up and go away

00:13:00.398 --> 00:13:01.334
it doesn't matter.

00:13:01.358 --> 00:13:02.998
we will still continue to sing in the same way.

00:13:03.023 --> 00:13:05.994
we will say the same way' or 'continue to make the same way.

00:13:06.018 --> 00:13:09.815
To put the Agnya chakra right

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:13.142
we must first put right, this strange ego which says that

00:13:13.166 --> 00:13:14.147
whatever we have been doing

00:13:14.172 --> 00:13:16.476
and whatever we have done, is the only right way

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.803
and whatever we do is right.

00:13:18.828 --> 00:13:25.891
This methodology we have made, we have to change this method.

00:13:25.915 --> 00:13:27.971
Now there are so many things in this.

00:13:27.995 --> 00:13:32.164
For example, we belong to some dharma.

00:13:32.189 --> 00:13:40.191
For example, we are Brahmo Samaji, or Hindus, or Muslims, Christians etc.

00:13:40.216 --> 00:13:42.213
You are nothing but a human being.

00:13:42.237 --> 00:13:43.947
You were born as a human being.

00:13:43.972 --> 00:13:49.021
You have branded yourself that I am this, I am that.

00:13:49.045 --> 00:13:52.157
You are neither Bengali nor Marathi.

00:13:52.181 --> 00:13:55.839
You are just human beings.

00:13:55.863 --> 00:13:59.379
By branding yourself you create more problems.

00:13:59.404 --> 00:14:04.397
like, I am Bengali, I am Marathi, I am this, I am that

00:14:04.422 --> 00:14:06.681
I am Christian, I am Muslim, I am Jain.

00:14:06.705 --> 00:14:08.281
All these are brands

00:14:08.306 --> 00:14:10.875
and these brands become so important

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.634
that you cannot see anything beyond that.

00:14:13.658 --> 00:14:18.555
That became the most important thing and nothing beyond that.

00:14:18.579 --> 00:14:20.765
This is another reason of the catch of Agnya.

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:23.388
It is very difficult to get rid of this catch.

00:14:23.413 --> 00:14:27.876
Till you get rid of this catch, your blindness will not go.

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:33.456
Because you will look at everything in a very narrow manner.

00:14:33.544 --> 00:14:37.907
It is not only here.  In the West also it is so.

00:14:37.932 --> 00:14:39.445
In the West it is even more

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:42.931
because, once something goes into their brains

00:14:42.956 --> 00:14:46.275
that 'it is good’, then they will follow it blindly.

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:49.761
There are such people that they are just critics.

00:14:49.785 --> 00:14:53.558
They will say, This art form is good, then it gets sold.

00:14:53.583 --> 00:14:55.891
Another critic says, This is not good, it won’t get sold.

00:14:55.916 --> 00:14:59.485
One critic is accepted.

00:14:59.509 --> 00:15:00.996
Then the other critics will come and say

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:03.513
This is useless, the other one is good. Accept that one.

00:15:03.537 --> 00:15:09.231
Nothing comes to them from their own brains, from within.

00:15:09.255 --> 00:15:11.263
Nothing is fixed.

00:15:11.287 --> 00:15:14.668
Whatever others have filled in your head is correct.

00:15:14.692 --> 00:15:17.557
This is the reason that they have filled our minds

00:15:17.581 --> 00:15:21.099
that we belong to this brand, that brand.

00:15:21.124 --> 00:15:21.730
Right from our childhood

00:15:21.755 --> 00:15:24.057
we are put into a certain brand, one after the other.

00:15:24.081 --> 00:15:25.809
In the end you belong to the same street.

00:15:25.834 --> 00:15:30.584
Don’t even belong to the same parents, same family.

00:15:30.608 --> 00:15:33.656
Like this the humans go on branding themselves.

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:37.176
The fault in branding is that

00:15:37.201 --> 00:15:43.579
they think that I am a great personality and very unique individual.

00:15:43.604 --> 00:15:44.947
He wants to become an Individual.

00:15:44.972 --> 00:15:49.292
Even though, i have been branded but i have to become an individual.

00:15:49.316 --> 00:15:55.684
And this itself, which is the essence of truth

00:15:55.708 --> 00:15:58.686
that we are all one.

00:15:58.711 --> 00:16:03.685
we are whole, (NOT CLEAR), totality

00:16:03.709 --> 00:16:07.233
Everything is one, it goes in the opposition of this truth.

00:16:07.258 --> 00:16:12.372
When you go in opposition – ‚'I am this type of person or that type of person’ .

00:16:12.396 --> 00:16:15.293
From this you are getting separated from each other.

00:16:15.317 --> 00:16:18.761
For example, you say, 'I am Hindu, you are a Muslim', you separate into two.

00:16:18.785 --> 00:16:20.809
Then again in Muslims, you are bifurcated in four categories.

00:16:20.834 --> 00:16:23.194
Those four categories of Muslims will have another ten divisions.

00:16:23.218 --> 00:16:25.959
Like this you go on separating yourself.

00:16:25.983 --> 00:16:30.007
You start losing the connection with the whole

00:16:30.031 --> 00:16:34.733
which is the goal of your life to achieve.

00:16:34.757 --> 00:16:42.245
So the first thing is that, all the variety has been made by God.

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:46.844
But one leaf doesn’t resemble the other, but if they are all on one tree

00:16:46.868 --> 00:16:54.863
they are all part and parcel of the Virata.

00:16:54.888 --> 00:16:59.414
And if we are all parts of one person

00:16:59.439 --> 00:17:05.251
in that wholeness, the individuality is adjoined.

00:17:05.276 --> 00:17:08.669
So, by separating ourselves, we destroy ourselves.

00:17:08.693 --> 00:17:12.014
And in this way, the saraswati tatwa

00:17:12.039 --> 00:17:14.873
which should manifest into Maha Saraswati is not there.

00:17:14.897 --> 00:17:26.388
At the Maha Saraswati level, man's ideas, his vision changes.

00:17:26.413 --> 00:17:30.161
It changes even in his daily life.

00:17:30.185 --> 00:17:37.328
The person starts to see that they all have become whole.

00:17:37.352 --> 00:17:40.090
Now, we are all one.

00:17:40.114 --> 00:17:44.269
So then, whatever he creates, or does

00:17:44.293 --> 00:17:47.499
he creates some such beautiful thing

00:17:47.523 --> 00:17:50.478
or, he does such a beautiful work

00:17:50.503 --> 00:17:54.023
that man recognizes by heart only.

00:17:54.047 --> 00:17:58.539
By heart only he says that it is beautiful.

00:17:58.563 --> 00:18:01.633
But even then, it should be understood

00:18:01.658 --> 00:18:08.190
that whatever are our jobs of Saraswati

00:18:08.215 --> 00:18:12.114
that we think that we are worshipping Saraswati.

00:18:12.138 --> 00:18:14.684
Why don't they understand?

00:18:14.708 --> 00:18:19.655
If they do Saraswati's work, if they are surrendered to God

00:18:19.679 --> 00:18:21.271
they become immortal.

00:18:21.295 --> 00:18:26.843
Now you see, the peotry that has become immortal in the world

00:18:26.867 --> 00:18:29.917
it is God's work.

00:18:29.941 --> 00:18:32.348
The poems and songs

00:18:32.373 --> 00:18:34.668
Now, you see new songs have come

00:18:34.692 --> 00:18:38.009
new songs come and die down soon.

00:18:38.033 --> 00:18:42.533
We listen to only those songs, repeat only those things

00:18:42.557 --> 00:18:45.995
which were written by Kabir, written by Gyaneshwar.

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:49.359
Even in foreign countries, I see that

00:18:49.384 --> 00:18:52.166
what was written by William Blake is recognized.

00:18:52.191 --> 00:18:55.052
what was written by Shakesphere is recognized.

00:18:55.077 --> 00:18:59.403
They were all self realized people.

00:18:59.427 --> 00:19:01.661
Mozart was self realized.

00:19:01.685 --> 00:19:07.600
Maha Saraswati Shakti they had because of self realization.

00:19:07.876 --> 00:19:13.054
whatever they wrote because of that power, was of a unique kind.

00:19:13.078 --> 00:19:19.027
There was nothing in them that you could say

00:19:19.052 --> 00:19:22.569
that they looked uncultured.

00:19:22.593 --> 00:19:28.992
They were so cultured that they could unite the world.

00:19:29.016 --> 00:19:30.802
So, Once you become a Sahaja yogi

00:19:30.827 --> 00:19:34.059
then you should move on to the Maha Saraswati tattwa.

00:19:34.084 --> 00:19:36.446
You should not follow Saraswati Tattwa

00:19:36.471 --> 00:19:41.384
because it limits you, your imagination is like that.

00:19:41.408 --> 00:19:43.966
If Saraswati Tattwa is the seed

00:19:43.991 --> 00:19:46.781
then its tree is Maha Saraswati.

00:19:46.805 --> 00:19:50.615
Till you do not make this seed into Maha Saraswati

00:19:50.639 --> 00:19:55.325
till then you cannot get connected to Maha Laxmi.

00:19:55.349 --> 00:20:06.748
The blessing of Mahalaxmi is that you get your self realization.

00:20:06.772 --> 00:20:12.550
The third thing that you have achieved is

00:20:12.574 --> 00:20:15.224
which we can say is MahaKali Tattwa.

00:20:15.248 --> 00:20:16.838
All the three Powers (Mahalakshmi, Maha Saraswati and Maha Kali)

00:20:16.863 --> 00:20:18.828
meet at your Agnya.

00:20:18.852 --> 00:20:23.201
And you should cross over this Agnya.

00:20:23.225 --> 00:20:28.066
In every subtle way there is an ego.

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:31.970
Introspect yourself. After all why do I believe in this?

00:20:31.994 --> 00:20:33.994
My father, grandfather followed it

00:20:34.018 --> 00:20:35.516
their father and grandfather followed it

00:20:35.541 --> 00:20:38.377
and I am limitting myself to such small beliefs

00:20:38.401 --> 00:20:43.800
and how can I enlighten the whole world?

00:20:43.824 --> 00:20:49.559
I would tell everyone, You see, pay attention to yourself, on yourself.

00:20:49.583 --> 00:20:54.790
Many people recognize Me, worship Me as Goddess, from their heart.

00:20:54.814 --> 00:20:56.869
But how it has benifitted Me?

00:20:56.893 --> 00:21:00.512
I am what I am. What is there anything special about it?

00:21:00.536 --> 00:21:02.508
I am what I am. I have not done anything.

00:21:02.532 --> 00:21:06.884
It is your greatness that you, I am so surprised that

00:21:06.909 --> 00:21:10.273
from Saraswati Tattwa you have risen to Maha Saraswati Tattwa.

00:21:10.298 --> 00:21:14.695
So it is your quality and you have got it.

00:21:14.719 --> 00:21:17.416
I neither got it nor did anything.

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:19.710
I am telling you a very simple thing

00:21:19.734 --> 00:21:23.297
that when I see that you are surrendered to Me only

00:21:23.321 --> 00:21:27.556
I feel that you may compromise with this only

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:30.016
that we recognize Mother.

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:32.569
You have to recognize yourself.

00:21:32.593 --> 00:21:36.577
You have to recognize yourself and you have to raise yourself.

00:21:36.601 --> 00:21:38.746
This new era has come.

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:43.521
the same type which I say, recently I said in Mumbai, that is also of Bodhi Sarpa.

00:21:43.545 --> 00:21:50.264
In this, you have become Budh, you have got Bodha.

00:21:50.289 --> 00:21:53.578
you have come to know what all this is.

00:21:53.602 --> 00:22:00.704
Now for this truth, light has been enlightened within you.

00:22:00.729 --> 00:22:05.839
Now this light has to ignite thousands of lights, this Bodhi Satya.

00:22:05.863 --> 00:22:08.393
If you cannot do this work

00:22:08.417 --> 00:22:12.480
then for you, for us, it is all useless effort.

00:22:12.504 --> 00:22:18.521
Because, what I am, to love Me what is the special you get?

00:22:18.546 --> 00:22:21.038
You must be feeling good to love your Mother.

00:22:21.063 --> 00:22:22.936
I also like. It is o.k.

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:25.870
But I cannot change your direction.

00:22:25.895 --> 00:22:30.062
Love to Mother so much, I became instantaneously emmotional.

00:22:30.087 --> 00:22:34.209
I wanted to speak something, but could not.

00:22:34.234 --> 00:22:41.059
But the state beyond this is that there is joy.

00:22:41.146 --> 00:22:46.300
There is a state beyond this, which we call absolute NIRANAND.

00:22:46.325 --> 00:22:49.650
And your Mother will have Niranand only when She will see

00:22:49.675 --> 00:22:51.847
that Her children have done more work than Her.

00:22:51.872 --> 00:22:54.230
Let them get more powers than Me

00:22:54.254 --> 00:22:57.597
Mother wants that Her chidren should be more powerful than Her.

00:22:57.621 --> 00:23:01.935
But they have got stuck up in small small issues.

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:03.271
That they should give up.

00:23:03.296 --> 00:23:07.814
And this is not here only, it is even more so among Maharashtrians.

00:23:07.838 --> 00:23:14.105
I have seen in other people also that we are stuck in small pettinesses.

00:23:14.129 --> 00:23:16.334
I call them 'Kusanskari'.

00:23:16.359 --> 00:23:20.438
A saint having good Sanskaras would immediately open his heart

00:23:20.463 --> 00:23:24.288
and like flowers start to emit fragrance.

00:23:24.312 --> 00:23:29.002
Another thing of Maha Saraswati is that it can be executed into action.

00:23:29.026 --> 00:23:35.677
In Maha Saraswati Karya you start working it out.

00:23:35.701 --> 00:23:45.185
In the Mahakali Tatwa, you absorb, you take in and imbibe.

00:23:45.209 --> 00:23:51.613
But in Maha Saraswati you start working it out.

00:23:51.637 --> 00:23:57.741
In Mahakali, you can desire, you can even create.

00:23:57.765 --> 00:24:02.711
We desire that it should be this, i want this, i want that.

00:24:02.735 --> 00:24:05.295
i like this, i like that.

00:24:05.319 --> 00:24:10.810
But to implement it, is the work of Maha Saraswati.

00:24:10.834 --> 00:24:15.026
You will say, Mother i want that Sahajyoja should spread all around.

00:24:15.051 --> 00:24:21.611
Very good! Your desire is very good! But what have you done for that?

00:24:21.635 --> 00:24:24.780
But what have you done for the sake of that?

00:24:24.804 --> 00:24:27.147
You are thinking about yourself only

00:24:27.172 --> 00:24:29.359
that it should be like this, it should be like that.

00:24:29.383 --> 00:24:31.120
And the same questions about yourself.

00:24:31.145 --> 00:24:32.734
My father is like this,my father is like that

00:24:32.758 --> 00:24:34.908
my brother is like that, his ailment is not over.

00:24:34.933 --> 00:24:39.051
His this thing is not cured, his that thing is not cured.

00:24:39.076 --> 00:24:44.433
What such work you have done

00:24:44.458 --> 00:24:50.646
on account of which Maha Saraswati Tatwa will fully evolve within you.

00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:52.119
This you should think.

00:24:52.144 --> 00:24:54.242
To how many people we have given realization?

00:24:54.267 --> 00:24:56.941
To how many people we have told about Sahajyoga?

00:24:56.965 --> 00:24:59.713
I was very happy when they told Me

00:24:59.738 --> 00:25:03.039
that here many people of Yuva Shakti.

00:25:03.063 --> 00:25:06.188
They fixed many posters, they worked for nights together.

00:25:06.236 --> 00:25:07.617
I was very happy to listen to it.

00:25:07.642 --> 00:25:10.613
And just now a senior Jounalist came to Me and said

00:25:10.638 --> 00:25:14.089
It laid a great impression on Me

00:25:14.114 --> 00:25:20.517
I saw many young boys travelling with me in the train at 1.30 a.m

00:25:20.541 --> 00:25:24.256
Some would get down and then some would get down, at the next station.

00:25:24.281 --> 00:25:25.365
They were very cool.

00:25:25.389 --> 00:25:27.344
I asked them, What are you doing?

00:25:27.369 --> 00:25:28.991
They said, We are fixing Mother's posters.

00:25:29.016 --> 00:25:31.889
He said, I have not seen such young boys till date.

00:25:31.913 --> 00:25:36.182
Such nice boys, young, educated, working so coolly.

00:25:36.206 --> 00:25:37.829
And there were some girls also with them.

00:25:37.854 --> 00:25:40.624
In a great friendly manner, all of them were sitting.

00:25:40.649 --> 00:25:45.462
Then I asked them about Sahajyoga and I was very much impressed.

00:25:45.486 --> 00:25:46.782
So it should be implemented.

00:25:46.806 --> 00:25:52.936
It means that whatever are our desires, we should work for that.

00:25:52.960 --> 00:26:01.000
Whatever we think, we should add it to our agenda.

00:26:01.025 --> 00:26:02.889
We have to show it by doing.

00:26:02.913 --> 00:26:06.661
Otherwise, it will be just talk in the air.

00:26:06.685 --> 00:26:07.317
It will be just in the air, I wanted to do this

00:26:07.341 --> 00:26:12.669
i wanted to do that, wanted to do something, i wanted to do this.

00:26:12.693 --> 00:26:17.514
Your desires will be over, when you will work.

00:26:17.538 --> 00:26:18.704
Then you will come to know that

00:26:18.729 --> 00:26:21.767
you should want only that which is possible.

00:26:21.792 --> 00:26:25.712
And that which is not possible to desire, that is destruction.

00:26:25.736 --> 00:26:26.636
And the same thing is

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:31.348
that there is as you see now a days, the problem of joblessness.

00:26:31.372 --> 00:26:35.155
Now, here are many rich as well as poor people.

00:26:35.179 --> 00:26:37.933
When I listen to the problems of rich people

00:26:37.958 --> 00:26:41.644
I feel that they have got the same problems as that of the poor.

00:26:41.668 --> 00:26:48.989
That they say, see Mother, here we have labour problem

00:26:49.013 --> 00:26:51.757
and that is why our factories are shut down.

00:26:51.781 --> 00:26:55.069
Now, rich must think

00:26:55.093 --> 00:26:58.683
that labour is your part and parcel.

00:26:58.707 --> 00:27:01.418
You cannot do without labour.

00:27:01.442 --> 00:27:04.525
You don't want to use your hands, you are sitting on the chair only.

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:06.889
That is called motor scanning.

00:27:06.914 --> 00:27:11.719
You did it for labour. It is not with money only.

00:27:11.743 --> 00:27:14.707
They also raised the flag and then gave the money.

00:27:14.731 --> 00:27:17.185
Then they will raise flag again and ask for money.

00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:18.773
There is no sense behind it.

00:27:18.797 --> 00:27:22.885
You worked to solve their problem.

00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:24.412
First find out

00:27:24.436 --> 00:27:27.998
For example, in Bombay it was, one gentleman came and said.

00:27:28.023 --> 00:27:30.051
I told him that if you have to get work from Marathis

00:27:30.076 --> 00:27:32.445
first make Ganpatti Temple.

00:27:32.469 --> 00:27:36.828
On this Diwali, you go to their residences and give them something.

00:27:36.852 --> 00:27:38.753
We had given (some gift) on Diwali.

00:27:38.778 --> 00:27:41.231
First understand their culture.

00:27:41.255 --> 00:27:44.371
And now here, may be great industrialists

00:27:44.396 --> 00:27:48.258
they don't know what is their culture?

00:27:48.282 --> 00:27:51.105
In their culture, what do the people believe in

00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:53.048
and what we have to understand in their culture.

00:27:53.073 --> 00:27:58.325
If they are rich people or running great industries

00:27:58.349 --> 00:28:00.919
if they understand Bengalis' state of mind.

00:28:00.944 --> 00:28:03.524
I will recognize them in a minute.

00:28:03.548 --> 00:28:08.685
They are very good at heart.

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:10.949
That you just have a cup of tea with them

00:28:10.974 --> 00:28:13.500
and they will be your life long friends.

00:28:13.524 --> 00:28:17.595
If you show adamancy, you are great enemies.

00:28:17.619 --> 00:28:19.651
This is the speciality of Bengalis.

00:28:19.675 --> 00:28:21.706
Why do you exhibit your adamantness?

00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:26.566
Be with them, talk to them, ask them questions and know them.

00:28:26.591 --> 00:28:28.987
I call this 'enlightened entrepreneurs'.

00:28:29.011 --> 00:28:32.723
Now you are enlightened, you have come to Sahajyoga.

00:28:32.748 --> 00:28:35.263
Now you should go to their houses

00:28:35.287 --> 00:28:37.801
and see what are their problems, what do they need?

00:28:37.826 --> 00:28:43.195
You help them a little bit, they will be at your service life long.

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:46.923
Because I have personally experienced

00:28:46.947 --> 00:28:49.772
the organization My husband was running

00:28:49.796 --> 00:28:51.911
they had lot of questions.

00:28:51.935 --> 00:28:54.344
I told them to make a family of everyone.

00:28:54.368 --> 00:28:57.272
And first of all study them, whosoever comes.

00:28:57.297 --> 00:28:59.409
Even from Calcuuta the people of Union come

00:28:59.434 --> 00:29:01.052
we serve them break fast.

00:29:01.077 --> 00:29:05.204
Talk to them, ask them, what are your questions?

00:29:05.228 --> 00:29:06.451
Then there are questions about their houses.

00:29:06.476 --> 00:29:09.249
I said, that these can be solved from your office.

00:29:09.273 --> 00:29:11.506
Make such an arrangement that they get houses.

00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:12.789
When this is done

00:29:12.814 --> 00:29:15.923
you make an arrangement for their children's education.

00:29:15.947 --> 00:29:18.165
It is not necessary that you give them raise and give them money.

00:29:18.189 --> 00:29:22.695
Because if they get money, they will straightaway go to have drinks.

00:29:22.719 --> 00:29:24.345
Or they may have two to four women.

00:29:24.369 --> 00:29:25.995
That is not going to help in any way.

00:29:26.019 --> 00:29:29.361
But if you help them really, deeply by heart

00:29:29.385 --> 00:29:34.723
and understand them by heart and think that they are your part and parcel.

00:29:34.747 --> 00:29:37.064
NOT CLEAR

00:29:37.088 --> 00:29:38.556
there should not be any falsehood in that.

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:43.104
But by heart, you only do everything and win their heart.

00:29:43.128 --> 00:29:45.870
All your questions will be over.

00:29:45.894 --> 00:29:51.826
This country is so blessed, that there should be abundance of Lakshmi.

00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:53.987
But this is a very great question

00:29:54.012 --> 00:29:56.782
that here people do not take to Maha Saraswati Principle.

00:29:56.806 --> 00:30:00.025
Their access is only upto Saraswati Principle.

00:30:00.049 --> 00:30:03.818
When you adopt Maha Saraswati Tatwa

00:30:03.842 --> 00:30:06.448
you in this matter will get busy into it.

00:30:06.473 --> 00:30:07.786
For that it is not necessary that

00:30:07.810 --> 00:30:10.207
you do 420 activity, some hypocracy, nothing.

00:30:10.231 --> 00:30:12.907
Everything will be alright on its own

00:30:12.932 --> 00:30:14.913
Because otherwise also, you are a sahajyogi.

00:30:14.937 --> 00:30:18.588
All the work of Sahaja Yogis gets done very easily.

00:30:18.612 --> 00:30:23.033
But following Sahaj yoga rules is compulsory.

00:30:23.057 --> 00:30:32.381
NOT CLEAR

00:30:32.406 --> 00:30:37.212
and everybody should spread it.

00:30:37.237 --> 00:30:39.914
unless you ascent from inside

00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:42.565
you cannot spread it outside, however you may want.

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:46.830
That is why in Sahajyoga, it is very important to meditate.

00:30:46.855 --> 00:30:51.802
You should meditate. I don't say , you get up at 5 a.m in the morning

00:30:51.826 --> 00:30:55.235
But you meditate for 5 minutes in the morning

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:57.342
and for 10 minutes in the evening.

00:30:57.366 --> 00:31:00.929
And it is not that if you missed it one day, it is a great mistake

00:31:00.953 --> 00:31:05.913
but it will clense you and you will be blessed.

00:31:05.937 --> 00:31:10.352
Out of that I say , it is full time your protection.

00:31:10.376 --> 00:31:12.787
All the time you are protected.

00:31:12.811 --> 00:31:16.348
You get a full time guidance

00:31:16.372 --> 00:31:19.723
and entertainment all the time.

00:31:19.747 --> 00:31:22.058
There is nothing that will not entertain you.

00:31:22.083 --> 00:31:24.676
Yesterday I went there, all the Sahajyogis were sitting there.

00:31:24.701 --> 00:31:28.781
Amongst themselves, they were raising their kundalinis.

00:31:28.806 --> 00:31:34.294
They were leg pulling each other, talking, laughing and enjoying themselves.

00:31:34.318 --> 00:31:36.525
Again I was happy to see this.

00:31:36.549 --> 00:31:39.515
There was nothing to give any pain to anybody.

00:31:39.539 --> 00:31:41.247
and in a lot of enjoyment and happiness

00:31:41.271 --> 00:31:44.500
all of them were entertained and enjoying.

00:31:44.524 --> 00:31:51.751
In which there is enjoyment, there is uplitfment, spiritual upliftment.

00:31:51.776 --> 00:31:56.733
and which will be for the welfare of society, of country and of the universe.

00:31:56.758 --> 00:31:59.538
Such is the great work of Sahajyoga.

00:31:59.562 --> 00:32:01.844
You should workout this.

00:32:01.868 --> 00:32:07.023
As such Sahajyoga has spread in 55 countries.

00:32:07.047 --> 00:32:09.786
Even now the tatwas that are there

00:32:09.811 --> 00:32:12.737
are not even that of Mahasaraswati.

00:32:12.761 --> 00:32:18.054
All the people, all think 'Love Mother'

00:32:18.078 --> 00:32:22.039
SEVA KARO, of Mother, be busy with worshipping Mother.

00:32:22.063 --> 00:32:26.928
That is o.k, that helps you a little to have faith.

00:32:26.953 --> 00:32:31.342
That is not going to benefit you.

00:32:31.366 --> 00:32:37.164
NOT CLEAR

00:32:37.188 --> 00:32:38.701
Now depth has been attained.

00:32:38.725 --> 00:32:45.003
let us suppose that you have achieved your depth.

00:32:45.027 --> 00:32:47.327
But what is the use of that depth?

00:32:47.351 --> 00:32:54.376
What is the use of such a deep pot in which we have not to fill water?

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.229
That is useless.

00:32:56.254 --> 00:32:58.741
Whether that is deep or shallow, what is the use of that?

00:32:58.766 --> 00:32:59.709
It has no utility.

00:32:59.733 --> 00:33:03.247
For whatever you have created that depth

00:33:03.272 --> 00:33:07.430
if you have to make use of it, get busy into that.

00:33:07.454 --> 00:33:13.253
what is the use of you certificates of that depth?

00:33:13.294 --> 00:33:18.147
It is possible, it is o.k, that in spiritualism

00:33:18.172 --> 00:33:20.669
people will take you as a saintly person.

00:33:20.693 --> 00:33:25.205
You are very great, cool breeze flows out of you.

00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:26.468
As I am sitting here

00:33:26.492 --> 00:33:28.775
but I don't do anything, I am inactive.

00:33:28.799 --> 00:33:32.894
It is useless, you should do something if you are inactive

00:33:32.918 --> 00:33:36.717
What is the use of such a life which makes us inactive?

00:33:36.741 --> 00:33:39.288
So, we should get busy in some or the other work.

00:33:39.312 --> 00:33:43.496
Now you must think on Agnya chakra that Mother had said

00:33:43.521 --> 00:33:45.214
So what should we do?

00:33:45.239 --> 00:33:49.400
If you go to NIRVICHAR state, you will get an inspiration from inside only

00:33:49.425 --> 00:33:53.425
that you can do this, do this, this can be done, do this.

00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:56.070
In this way only Sahajyoga is going to spread.

00:33:56.114 --> 00:33:59.006
So, the people here who are very deep.

00:33:59.031 --> 00:34:02.127
Also I felt very happy to see that they are very deep.

00:34:02.151 --> 00:34:05.721
Now we have to distribute this depth.

00:34:05.745 --> 00:34:09.960
It is of no use that few people will be deep, say like Ravinder Babu.

00:34:09.985 --> 00:34:12.223
But others will lag behind.

00:34:12.248 --> 00:34:19.106
For example, in a pond some lotuses will come out

00:34:19.131 --> 00:34:20.663
and there are some insects also.

00:34:20.688 --> 00:34:26.495
They say, see in our pond there are so many lotuses, but you are still an insect.

00:34:26.519 --> 00:34:30.373
So, even if you are so, are so many flowers, have become lotuses too

00:34:30.397 --> 00:34:32.939
what is its use to others?

00:34:32.963 --> 00:34:35.144
So, this Maha Saraswati Tatwa

00:34:35.169 --> 00:34:39.056
to which we had not paid so much attention till now.

00:34:39.081 --> 00:34:46.420
That is why I have started (to emphasize) that Maha Saraswati should be worshipped.

00:34:46.444 --> 00:34:52.218
Mahasaraswati Tatwa in our country is the creation of the Vedas.

00:34:52.242 --> 00:34:53.809
In that also, it is said that

00:34:53.834 --> 00:34:56.818
if you have not experienced 'Vidha', there is no 'Veda' also.

00:34:56.867 --> 00:34:59.584
About the creation of 'Vedas' they said that

00:34:59.609 --> 00:35:03.270
These are' Panch Mahabhoots', its work must be done beforehand.

00:35:03.294 --> 00:35:05.833
We must see them, give them realization.

00:35:05.858 --> 00:35:10.058
After giving them realization, we must utilize them.

00:35:10.082 --> 00:35:11.090
It is because of that only

00:35:11.115 --> 00:35:13.635
the science etc., came to our country.

00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:17.225
In our country, long back scientific research had taken place.

00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:19.773
In comparison to modern science

00:35:19.798 --> 00:35:21.379
in our country, science was much before

00:35:21.403 --> 00:35:22.860
because of 'Vedas'.

00:35:22.885 --> 00:35:27.176
Through vedas they attained dominion over the five elements.

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.626
And you can also get it.

00:35:28.650 --> 00:35:31.129
With the help of Sahajyoga also, you can control five elements.

00:35:31.153 --> 00:35:33.085
But you move your hands.

00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:34.938
You pay your attention there.

00:35:34.962 --> 00:35:39.077
One thing is that, Mother, see my mother is sick.

00:35:39.101 --> 00:35:43.402
Oh! you are a Sahajyogi, you can cure her. use your hands.

00:35:43.426 --> 00:35:46.061
First check, if you can cure her or not?

00:35:46.085 --> 00:35:48.977
If you cannot cure her, get her to Me.

00:35:49.002 --> 00:35:50.106
What do you talk?

00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:51.338
Every thing Mother will do.

00:35:51.362 --> 00:35:53.317
If somebody is sick, Mother will cure.

00:35:53.342 --> 00:35:56.044
If there is some trouble, telephone Mother.

00:35:56.069 --> 00:35:59.417
You see, that you yourself can cure her.

00:35:59.441 --> 00:36:03.716
You put your hand on her, learn, you can do.

00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:06.620
You yourself are powerful, you have got unlimited powers.

00:36:06.645 --> 00:36:10.107
You use the powers that have been given to you.

00:36:10.132 --> 00:36:13.710
You distribute with the help of your hands.

00:36:13.789 --> 00:36:22.058
You will be surprised that your so many powers, your own powers will emit.

00:36:22.082 --> 00:36:25.666
This I repeatedly say that you yourself do something.

00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:29.616
Whosoever is there, want to put the burden on Me, is of no use.

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:33.175
O.k I will cure , but you can do better than Me.

00:36:33.199 --> 00:36:34.775
So, why don't you do?

00:36:34.799 --> 00:36:38.908
Do it quickly. You should help each other also.

00:36:38.932 --> 00:36:40.689
Among Sahajyogis, if one is sick

00:36:40.713 --> 00:36:44.074
the other who is alright should go and help that (sick) person.

00:36:44.098 --> 00:36:47.286
Rush quickly. See that your plan works.

00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:49.643
If it doesn't work, then tell Me.

00:36:49.668 --> 00:36:55.822
And I am telling you absolutely, that you have this power all the time.

00:36:55.847 --> 00:36:59.574
And the more you use it, the more it will grow and the more it will work.

00:36:59.599 --> 00:37:02.968
and the more it will work and you will be successful.

00:37:02.992 --> 00:37:05.217
But have faith on yourself.

00:37:05.241 --> 00:37:06.860
Mother has told us so

00:37:06.885 --> 00:37:09.782
Surely it is within us, and we should take it forward.

00:37:09.806 --> 00:37:13.247
I have to tell for all of you that depth has been achieved in Sahajyoga

00:37:13.271 --> 00:37:16.880
but so far as, 'giving it (to others)' is concerned, it is a little less.

00:37:16.904 --> 00:37:19.495
Because you are very deep, I agree

00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:22.109
the Sahajyogis of our country are very deep.

00:37:22.133 --> 00:37:26.912
Now you have to start giving it to people, distribute it among people.

00:37:26.936 --> 00:37:31.481
And start making them understand and bring other people into Sahajyoga.

00:37:31.505 --> 00:37:35.701
You can cure them, you can bring them into balance.

00:37:35.725 --> 00:37:40.414
When you will get busy into it, when Maha Saraswari Tatwa will be awakened

00:37:40.438 --> 00:37:43.420
you will be amazed

00:37:43.444 --> 00:37:47.047
that how much this country has progressed.

00:37:47.071 --> 00:37:54.730
But this disease of laziness is there throughout India, not only here.

00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:56.462
Everybody is lazy.

00:37:56.486 --> 00:38:01.795
And there are so many excuses, why don't we do?

00:38:01.819 --> 00:38:05.662
We don't do because of this, because of that.

00:38:05.686 --> 00:38:07.896
Even in Sahajyoga, people make lot of excuses.

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:11.795
Now if you start working without telling excuses

00:38:11.819 --> 00:38:13.169
For example, somebody will say

00:38:13.194 --> 00:38:17.596
We had gone there but there the sheet was not clean.

00:38:17.621 --> 00:38:19.696
So you clean it.

00:38:19.721 --> 00:38:24.532
To make some excuses, it was so , that is why it could not be done.

00:38:24.556 --> 00:38:30.038
or that we are afraid of our society, or that we are afraid of our brother.

00:38:30.062 --> 00:38:31.402
Because of such scared people

00:38:31.427 --> 00:38:34.060
neither there can be betterment of them nor of Sahajyoga.

00:38:34.084 --> 00:38:37.536
Sahajyoga is not for cowards, it is for brave people.

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:40.057
And you should volunteer yourself.

00:38:40.081 --> 00:38:42.020
You should come forward.

00:38:42.044 --> 00:38:46.464
You should invite everyone, you should give challenge, 'come and see.'

00:38:46.488 --> 00:38:48.026
Then it will work out.

00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:53.252
Because you are noticing how much bkack magic has spread in Bengal.

00:38:53.276 --> 00:38:57.205
Since I came, I see how much black magic is here.

00:38:57.229 --> 00:38:59.657
Since yesterday, I am just clearing it, clearing it out.

00:38:59.681 --> 00:39:04.186
Whosoever I see, says, I am sad, he is sad, they are sad.

00:39:04.211 --> 00:39:08.344
If everybody is sad, what is sadness?

00:39:08.368 --> 00:39:10.685
Whosoever I see says, my foot broke, i am sad

00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:12.876
my head is paining, i am sad.

00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:17.012
So this poverty is also because of this black magic.

00:39:17.036 --> 00:39:20.004
You should get rid of this black magic.

00:39:20.028 --> 00:39:24.381
And for this you should have some special thing.

00:39:24.406 --> 00:39:27.830
If you also say, i belong to this religion, i belong to that religion

00:39:27.854 --> 00:39:31.660
I am disciple of this guru, I am diciple of that guru, this is my guru.

00:39:31.684 --> 00:39:34.951
You have photographs of these gurus and all this

00:39:34.976 --> 00:39:38.308
of which you do not have any good experience till now

00:39:38.332 --> 00:39:41.609
whom you have not seen, not heard of, don't know him

00:39:41.634 --> 00:39:44.624
what is the use of running after such people?

00:39:44.648 --> 00:39:48.590
The person who is in front of you, accept him and get busy in that.

00:39:48.614 --> 00:39:55.622
So today's puja according to Me should be for the whole of India.

00:39:55.646 --> 00:39:58.926
This disease is in whole of India.

00:39:58.950 --> 00:40:02.536
We are active. You are not avtive at all.

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:09.391
What we are, we have lot of desires, lot of desires.

00:40:09.415 --> 00:40:13.005
For example there are politicians, 'i will do this , i will do that'.

00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:16.235
But as soon as they occupy their seats, they forget

00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:19.855
and have no desire except earning money.

00:40:19.893 --> 00:40:22.207
It should not be so in Sahajyoga.

00:40:22.231 --> 00:40:24.303
In Sahajyoga we have to work.

00:40:24.327 --> 00:40:27.931
And for working it out, what we have to do? We have to discuss.

00:40:27.955 --> 00:40:32.214
For this, you meet, discuss among yourselves what we have to do?

00:40:32.238 --> 00:40:34.010
What can we do?

00:40:34.034 --> 00:40:36.621
How can we take it forward?

00:40:36.645 --> 00:40:41.025
There is nothing in Sahajyoga which that picks up speed.

00:40:41.049 --> 00:40:43.276
We purchased this land for the sake of experiments.

00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:45.319
purchased the other, is rotting

00:40:45.344 --> 00:40:47.734
bought another land but is just lying there rotting.

00:40:47.758 --> 00:40:52.332
Till I don't come to India, not even a small path can be made.

00:40:52.356 --> 00:40:55.110
Not even a small hut can be constructed.

00:40:55.134 --> 00:41:00.727
I can't understand, even when there are so many people, no work is done.

00:41:00.751 --> 00:41:05.497
When I go, you disburse and get separated.

00:41:05.521 --> 00:41:08.571
And only two to four people work.

00:41:08.595 --> 00:41:12.400
Sahajyoga is a collective work.

00:41:12.424 --> 00:41:14.839
It is not the job of only two to four people only

00:41:14.863 --> 00:41:20.325
that just one or two people can do it.

00:41:20.428 --> 00:41:22.078
This also is important to understand.

00:41:22.102 --> 00:41:24.229
Only one person is doing everything.

00:41:24.254 --> 00:41:26.711
only one person is running, it can't be like this.

00:41:26.735 --> 00:41:30.663
Everybody has to get organized like the parts of a body.

00:41:30.687 --> 00:41:35.530
Not Clear

00:41:35.554 --> 00:41:39.113
A Sahajyogi is the part of one Sahajyoga.

00:41:39.137 --> 00:41:46.752
Imagine, there is something wrong with the finger itself.

00:41:46.777 --> 00:41:49.156
All over the body there will be pain definitely.

00:41:49.181 --> 00:41:55.862
But if this finger is finished, then from where can we get another one?

00:41:55.887 --> 00:41:57.897
Once you have come to Sahaja Yoga

00:41:57.922 --> 00:42:00.892
everything is Sahaja no doubt about that.

00:42:00.917 --> 00:42:04.203
But one thing that is Sahaj of all, does not go away

00:42:04.228 --> 00:42:07.266
and that is the small mindedness

00:42:07.291 --> 00:42:12.910
and this ignorance about being special people.

00:42:12.934 --> 00:42:18.611
I have only one great thing to tell all of you, out of love

00:42:18.636 --> 00:42:24.824
that all of you have  gained and achieved so much of depth, in Sahaja Yoga

00:42:24.849 --> 00:42:27.138
and now you should start spreading it.

00:42:27.163 --> 00:42:30.311
Till the time, the lamp is not lit

00:42:30.336 --> 00:42:35.593
we give it light and say that it is now enlightenend.

00:42:35.618 --> 00:42:39.818
But even after that if it asks for the light, what can one say?

00:42:39.843 --> 00:42:42.282
Now the enlightenend lamp should give light to others.

00:42:42.307 --> 00:42:44.124
Today you are listening to Me.

00:42:44.149 --> 00:42:47.436
Tomorrow you can sit in My place and do My work.

00:42:47.461 --> 00:42:50.233
When this happens only then Sahaja Yoga wil grow.

00:42:50.258 --> 00:42:54.099
Wherever this has happened, Sahaja Yoga has spread in those countries.

00:42:54.124 --> 00:43:00.133
I bless you that now many people may emerge after this puja and do this work.

00:43:00.158 --> 00:43:03.384
This is My eternal blessings.
