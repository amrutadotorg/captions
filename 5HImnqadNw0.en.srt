1
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:09,942
I bow to all the sahaja yogis of the world.

2
00:00:22,067 --> 00:00:24,816
It is very heartening

3
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:30,942
to see so many of you assembled here to do the Guru Puja.

4
00:00:42,983 --> 00:00:53,150
To worship your Guru in person is regarded as the highest blessing.

5
00:01:03,732 --> 00:01:10,317
But in My case it’s a very different combination

6
00:01:10,816 --> 00:01:14,609
that I am your Mother and your Guru.

7
00:01:23,067 --> 00:01:29,525
So you can understand how Shri Ganesha worshipped his Mother.

8
00:01:34,692 --> 00:01:38,942
You all are created in the same image of Shri Ganesha

9
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:47,150
who worshipped His Mother

10
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:52,651
and then He became the Adi Guru, the first Guru.

11
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:03,525
He is the primordial essence of mastery.

12
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:13,983
Only the Mother can make the child a master.

13
00:02:15,858 --> 00:02:21,275
And the motherhood in any Guru – whether male or female –

14
00:02:22,067 --> 00:02:25,775
can only make the disciple a Guru.

15
00:02:34,692 --> 00:02:39,234
So, first you have to become the prophets

16
00:02:39,732 --> 00:02:43,317
and develop that motherhood within yourself,

17
00:02:45,108 --> 00:02:49,816
then you can make others also prophets.

18
00:03:04,275 --> 00:03:06,942
Now, to become a Guru,

19
00:03:09,234 --> 00:03:14,609
what do we have to do after our realisation?

20
00:03:20,816 --> 00:03:24,317
Guru word means gravity.

21
00:03:29,234 --> 00:03:32,275
Gravity means a person who is grave

22
00:03:32,525 --> 00:03:37,733
who is deep, who is magnetic.

23
00:03:45,942 --> 00:03:48,651
Now as you have learnt in Sahaja Yoga

24
00:03:48,858 --> 00:03:53,150
that realisation takes place in complete effortlessness.

25
00:04:02,732 --> 00:04:08,692
So normally a Guru tries to make his disciples effortless,

26
00:04:17,275 --> 00:04:22,484
which is called as prayatna shaytilya – means ‘relax your efforts‘.

27
00:04:31,275 --> 00:04:34,317
Without doing anything you got

28
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:38,692
your prayatna shaytilya, otherwise Kundalini would not have risen.

29
00:04:49,275 --> 00:04:54,067
Then the second stage is vichara shaithilya – the thoughtless awareness.

30
00:05:02,692 --> 00:05:06,150
This also you got it without doing anything.

31
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,442
And the third is complete negation of thought, abhava,

32
00:05:21,067 --> 00:05:23,942
and the bliss of peace.

33
00:05:28,484 --> 00:05:30,775
So one has to understand that

34
00:05:31,025 --> 00:05:33,858
you have to pass then, through three stages.

35
00:05:38,775 --> 00:05:41,442
First, when you get your realisation

36
00:05:41,732 --> 00:05:46,732
all these things come spontaneously, for that moment.

37
00:05:54,732 --> 00:05:57,150
When you raise the Kundalini of others,

38
00:05:57,359 --> 00:06:00,317
these things happen to them spontaneously.

39
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,983
You too have that power now

40
00:06:07,275 --> 00:06:11,732
to raise the Kundalini of people and to establish it in them.

41
00:06:18,983 --> 00:06:23,359
But we must understand why it has to be done that way,

42
00:06:28,484 --> 00:06:31,484
why we have to have vichara shaithilya –

43
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:38,983
because when you project any thought,

44
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:40,983
it is artificial,

45
00:06:47,525 --> 00:06:49,192
it is not reality.

46
00:06:51,067 --> 00:06:54,108
Thought always stands between you and the reality.

47
00:06:58,942 --> 00:07:05,651
When you put in an effort, you stand against becoming.

48
00:07:14,108 --> 00:07:21,067
For example, if I have to cure you

49
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:25,567
I just put my hand and finished – no effort,

50
00:07:31,067 --> 00:07:34,067
because I am that.

51
00:07:35,942 --> 00:07:40,732
You get your realisation because I am that.

52
00:07:43,983 --> 00:07:48,692
I don’t put in any effort, I don’t think about it, I am that.

53
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,609
Just looking at someone, it can be done.

54
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:08,484
Just putting attention to someone, it can be done.

55
00:08:13,234 --> 00:08:17,525
Just with a small desire, it can be done –

56
00:08:21,275 --> 00:08:26,733
because you are that. You can mould it the way you like.

57
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,900
You can get an example from gold.

58
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:39,733
Now gold is untarnishable

59
00:08:39,942 --> 00:08:42,816
It does not have to think it is untarnishable,

60
00:08:43,067 --> 00:08:46,983
it does not have to put in an effort it is untarnishable – it is.

61
00:08:59,816 --> 00:09:06,692
So to be, to be, you don’t have to put in any effort.

62
00:09:06,942 --> 00:09:10,775
If you have to put in an effort, that means you are not yet that.

63
00:09:20,567 --> 00:09:25,359
If you look at the sun – it shines.

64
00:09:25,609 --> 00:09:30,651
It doesn’t have to put in effort to shine – it shines.

65
00:09:38,942 --> 00:09:42,651
So to be that, if you have to put in an effort,

66
00:09:42,858 --> 00:09:46,651
that means you are not that, you are trying, you are artificial.

67
00:09:56,651 --> 00:10:01,400
The flowers are beautiful so they don’t have to beautify themselves.

68
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:12,150
And this is what one has to understand – that innately

69
00:10:12,359 --> 00:10:16,816
if you are that,  if you have already become,

70
00:10:17,067 --> 00:10:19,733
then what is the need to put in any more effort?

71
00:10:31,525 --> 00:10:34,692
But when we say these things, you see,

72
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,484
then people think you have to be lethargic,

73
00:10:47,567 --> 00:10:49,442
that you need not do anything,

74
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,983
you become a Guru without doing anything.

75
00:10:58,234 --> 00:11:02,442
That’s why, at the very outset, I said it goes in stages.

76
00:11:08,816 --> 00:11:12,234
So the first stage is of Shri Ganesha –

77
00:11:15,692 --> 00:11:19,732
how He surrenders to the Shakti, to the Mother –

78
00:11:24,732 --> 00:11:27,567
that is the beginning. If one cannot surrender…

79
00:11:27,733 --> 00:11:30,150
That doesn’t mean you don’t do anything,

80
00:11:30,359 --> 00:11:33,317
but surrendering means the worship,

81
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:48,525
the respect of the higher,

82
00:11:52,732 --> 00:11:55,609
the obedience to the higher.

83
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,484
Not to argue it out,

84
00:12:04,692 --> 00:12:08,858
not to react, acceptance,

85
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:16,609
absorption. Like a child absorbs the milk of the mother

86
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,858
without questioning, without reasoning.

87
00:12:26,108 --> 00:12:29,692
That’s why Christ has said, “You have to become like children”.

88
00:12:33,234 --> 00:12:37,525
But if you are questioning, then you are no more a child.

89
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:41,275
So first is the state,

90
00:12:41,484 --> 00:12:44,816
which you have to develop, is the child-like state.

91
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:53,442
But child, which is a realised child, which has to have a gravity.

92
00:12:57,692 --> 00:13:04,025
If you can develop childhood first,

93
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:07,609
then everything takes proper course,

94
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,732
because maturity cannot take place unless

95
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,609
and until you start from the very beginning,

96
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,317
and gravity means maturity not frivolousness.

97
00:13:41,234 --> 00:13:43,692
So now the quality of Ganesha, as you know,

98
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:47,192
is that He has viveka, means He has discretion.

99
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:56,609
He ‘has’ means He is discretion.

100
00:13:59,816 --> 00:14:03,609
So try to develop your discretion power

101
00:14:08,816 --> 00:14:17,317
so that Shri Ganesha gives you the wisdom – subuddhi – wisdom.

102
00:14:22,108 --> 00:14:26,816
And this is why you have to have a dependence on Shri Ganesha.

103
00:14:31,732 --> 00:14:37,692
So at this point you have to make a negation of efforts.

104
00:14:41,609 --> 00:14:48,067
Like, whatever are efforts anti-Ganesha,

105
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,732
or anti-innocence must be negated.

106
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:08,108
So the negation of effort

107
00:15:08,525 --> 00:15:14,525
is to be achieved by negating whatever is the effort –

108
00:15:20,025 --> 00:15:23,732
means the effort of negation.

109
00:15:28,192 --> 00:15:31,108
So in the beginning you will not be effortless,

110
00:15:39,108 --> 00:15:42,567
you will have to put in effort for that.

111
00:15:47,816 --> 00:15:51,651
Like Christ has said, “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes”.

112
00:16:02,442 --> 00:16:05,609
So how do you make your eyes innocent?

113
00:16:08,942 --> 00:16:15,733
In Sahaja Yoga we have a method by which we try to distract our eyes

114
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:22,234
from effort that makes it adulterous.

115
00:16:33,858 --> 00:16:36,567
Like, we try to put our attention, our eyes,

116
00:16:36,733 --> 00:16:40,525
on the Mother Earth, on the grass, on the trees.

117
00:16:46,275 --> 00:16:52,359
So the avoidance, the avoiding of the effort itself is effort.

118
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,733
So those people who have come now,

119
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:08,733
recently, have to understand also that they have to put in

120
00:17:08,942 --> 00:17:12,359
all kinds of efforts to stop the efforts.

121
00:17:24,983 --> 00:17:29,108
For example, some people are used to very comfortable life,

122
00:17:29,275 --> 00:17:31,816
they may talk of all kinds of renunciation,

123
00:17:32,025 --> 00:17:35,067
when it comes to comfort, they want to have comfort.

124
00:17:42,775 --> 00:17:48,234
Such people should try to get out of the habit of comfort –

125
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:51,651
Sleep on the ground, sleep on the Mother Earth.

126
00:18:12,067 --> 00:18:14,150
Some people have an attention

127
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,359
which is all the time looking this side, that side –

128
00:18:16,525 --> 00:18:18,942
cannot see to one point – so fix your attention.

129
00:18:32,651 --> 00:18:37,651
So gradually, you will find, you’ll discipline yourself.

130
00:18:44,067 --> 00:18:47,108
So the effort that you put in

131
00:18:47,525 --> 00:18:51,816
is very important in the beginning of Sahaja Yoga.

132
00:19:00,317 --> 00:19:02,400
Another thing is very common, in the West,

133
00:19:02,692 --> 00:19:05,567
is the harsh tongue, the sarcasm

134
00:19:05,983 --> 00:19:11,567
and hurting others – is a very subtle way of violence.

135
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:26,442
Or if they are really blunt

136
00:19:26,692 --> 00:19:31,442
they can start with ego expressions also “I, I, I…”

137
00:19:39,025 --> 00:19:40,609
Such people should stop talking

138
00:19:40,775 --> 00:19:44,067
completely, make an effort to stop – just don’t talk.

139
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:52,442
Now watch your mind – is it

140
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:56,442
is it trying to talk something sarcastic, nonsensical?

141
00:20:07,108 --> 00:20:10,108
So, this watching also requires effort.

142
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:21,025
So, to sprout the seed is easy,

143
00:20:21,275 --> 00:20:26,108
but then one has to put in the effort to look after the little plant.

144
00:20:40,525 --> 00:20:44,400
And when it matures, then it’s on its own.

145
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:56,567
So the, first the effort should be made to protect yourself

146
00:20:56,775 --> 00:21:00,067
against the mind which you have built in,

147
00:21:00,317 --> 00:21:02,192
through your ego or superego,

148
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:06,651
that goes into the wrong direction of effort.

149
00:21:22,484 --> 00:21:26,525
But sometimes, be very careful, you have to be discreet.

150
00:21:34,651 --> 00:21:40,858
And the best way to be safe on discretion is to keep in the centre –

151
00:21:41,025 --> 00:21:44,442
never go to any extreme of anything.

152
00:21:53,983 --> 00:21:57,192
For example, some people are fond of music, say,

153
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:01,275
so they’ll go on after the music part of it.

154
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:09,275
Some people, say, are fond of poetry,

155
00:22:09,567 --> 00:22:12,400
then they’ll go after the poetry only.

156
00:22:19,651 --> 00:22:21,900
There is nothing wrong in those things,

157
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:26,609
but whatever you achieve in all these things

158
00:22:26,733 --> 00:22:28,942
must be brought back to the collective

159
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:31,484
and must be enjoyed by everyone,

160
00:22:31,733 --> 00:22:35,816
and you should also enjoy what others have found.

161
00:22:51,484 --> 00:22:57,400
For example, somebody is a very learned man and a dry person.

162
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:09,692
So he has to make an effort to make himself sweet.

163
00:23:14,484 --> 00:23:20,192
So try to neutralise your extreme nature by coming in the centre,

164
00:23:28,609 --> 00:23:32,692
and the best way to say is, “I like everything.

165
00:23:40,732 --> 00:23:44,733
The way You keep me, I am happy in that state.”

166
00:23:52,525 --> 00:23:57,442
And to suggest yourself that, “I am the peace”

167
00:23:58,816 --> 00:24:01,983
– suggest, autosuggestion,

168
00:24:09,317 --> 00:24:14,484
“I am the satisfaction, I am the dignity.”

169
00:24:16,275 --> 00:24:20,067
Try to impose these artificialities upon yourself

170
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,442
of these virtues and righteousness,

171
00:24:38,484 --> 00:24:43,108
and then ask yourself “If I am dignified how can I do such a thing?”

172
00:24:43,484 --> 00:24:47,816
Ask yourself, you judge yourself with those.

173
00:25:00,609 --> 00:25:03,400
For example, somebody is a miserly person

174
00:25:03,692 --> 00:25:05,816
and he says, “Oh you must be generous” –

175
00:25:06,025 --> 00:25:08,150
then you can call him a hypocrite.

176
00:25:13,775 --> 00:25:18,733
But supposing the miserly, you see, questions himself

177
00:25:19,234 --> 00:25:21,858
then he is not a hypocrite.

178
00:25:32,858 --> 00:25:38,359
So when you put all these artificial, so-called,

179
00:25:38,732 --> 00:25:44,525
values upon yourself – sort of a goal –

180
00:25:44,775 --> 00:25:49,192
and then try to achieve that goal through your own effort,

181
00:25:49,567 --> 00:25:51,732
then you become that.

182
00:26:15,983 --> 00:26:21,484
So automatically you criticise yourself and you don’t criticise others

183
00:26:27,192 --> 00:26:31,400
and you know what’s wrong with you.

184
00:26:34,732 --> 00:26:37,733
Because, what’s the use of knowing what’s wrong with others?

185
00:26:42,484 --> 00:26:45,651
It is like England trying to improve the conditions in India,

186
00:26:45,858 --> 00:26:49,234
and India trying to improve the conditions in England.

187
00:26:53,192 --> 00:26:56,858
But in this also human brain has an escape.

188
00:27:00,858 --> 00:27:04,150
When they want to criticise themselves, they find a pouch

189
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,275
called the left Vishuddhi and become settled there.

190
00:27:19,025 --> 00:27:22,108
The more cunning you are, the more clever you are,

191
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:24,484
the worse is the left Vishuddhi.

192
00:27:29,983 --> 00:27:33,942
Then you put everything there, settled down nicely to stagnate,

193
00:27:34,317 --> 00:27:36,651
to get all kinds of filth in it

194
00:27:36,858 --> 00:27:40,150
and to be settled with yourself nicely.

195
00:27:52,525 --> 00:27:54,525
It’s like any lousy housewife –

196
00:27:54,816 --> 00:27:56,275
she takes all the dirt of the house

197
00:27:56,484 --> 00:27:59,317
and all that and piles up into a room, locks it up,

198
00:27:59,651 --> 00:28:01,983
and thinks,  oh she has been very efficient.

199
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:17,025
You have to face it and you have to correct it and see to it!

200
00:28:22,484 --> 00:28:25,442
And that’s how you become powerful.

201
00:28:27,442 --> 00:28:29,775
Because if your machinery is out of gear,

202
00:28:30,025 --> 00:28:33,150
what’s the use of improving somebody else’s machinery?

203
00:28:38,234 --> 00:28:40,234
And when your machinery is out of gear,

204
00:28:40,484 --> 00:28:41,942
you put it in a lock and key,

205
00:28:42,192 --> 00:28:44,567
and lock it up and say, “Now it’s alright.”

206
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:55,567
Or you blame somebody because of this, because of that –

207
00:28:55,733 --> 00:28:58,484
something else other than you.

208
00:29:06,733 --> 00:29:10,983
Thank God to Sahaja Yoga today that you all have got realisation,

209
00:29:11,192 --> 00:29:14,234
so I don’t have to do all that cleaning, you can do yourself.

210
00:29:21,651 --> 00:29:26,192
So, in short, you become your own Guru to begin with.

211
00:29:29,609 --> 00:29:32,567
You try to tell yourself, separate yourself from yourself

212
00:29:32,775 --> 00:29:37,484
and say, “Hello Sir, how are you now, come along.”

213
00:29:47,525 --> 00:29:50,192
But in Sahaja Yoga, you see, people

214
00:29:51,108 --> 00:29:55,733
suddenly assume, you see, a big sort of a ego nonsense,

215
00:29:55,983 --> 00:29:57,692
and they think they are big gurus,

216
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:00,733
you see, big, great people, avadhutas, you see, like that.

217
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:12,775
And if you ask them,

218
00:30:12,942 --> 00:30:15,567
they say, “Mother, Mother I loved You very much.”

219
00:30:25,192 --> 00:30:27,692
So they think if they love Me, then it is My duty

220
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,359
that I should really keep you clean.

221
00:30:38,983 --> 00:30:42,442
That’s not the attitude of a guru.

222
00:30:45,732 --> 00:30:50,567
What guru does, is to purify himself and others

223
00:30:50,775 --> 00:30:55,150
and give those flowers to the Deity.

224
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:05,317
Till you all become gurus, I am your Guru,

225
00:31:05,732 --> 00:31:08,108
but once you become the guru

226
00:31:08,651 --> 00:31:11,275
then I become your Deity.

227
00:31:15,816 --> 00:31:22,858
Till they are not yet gurus, I am their Guru.

228
00:31:23,567 --> 00:31:25,275
Till they reach that state.

229
00:31:25,567 --> 00:31:29,900
Once they become the guru, then I am their Deity.

230
00:31:40,651 --> 00:31:45,567
Like all the Gurus, we can say Mohammad sahib –

231
00:31:45,942 --> 00:31:49,108
He talked of “Allah Hu Akbar.”

232
00:31:53,234 --> 00:31:55,858
He talked of the Holy Ghost,

233
00:31:56,942 --> 00:32:00,234
He talked of the resurrection,

234
00:32:00,609 --> 00:32:03,400
because He was a Guru.

235
00:32:03,732 --> 00:32:08,150
And whatever He had to say, He said it with full confidence

236
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,983
pointing out towards the point where

237
00:32:11,275 --> 00:32:15,442
He looks, or where He gets His guidance from.

238
00:32:24,733 --> 00:32:31,900
Like Moses, like Christ also put His two fingers denoting His Father

239
00:32:35,609 --> 00:32:39,442
So till you become your own guru,

240
00:32:39,733 --> 00:32:44,442
you have to put in effort in the beginning.

241
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:55,692
Then gradually you can achieve it effortlessly.

242
00:33:01,651 --> 00:33:05,733
Effortlessness is not to be certified,

243
00:33:08,732 --> 00:33:11,359
but you can verify it.

244
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:15,983
A person who is discrete –

245
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,900
in his presence others become discrete.

246
00:33:26,317 --> 00:33:32,525
A person who is honest – others in his presence become honest.

247
00:33:36,942 --> 00:33:41,567
It is said in Sanskrit language, ‘Yatha raja tatha praja’ –

248
00:33:41,816 --> 00:33:45,192
‘As the king is that’s how the subjects are’.

249
00:33:50,816 --> 00:33:54,983
When you are the guru, you are the example.

250
00:33:57,983 --> 00:34:00,732
You have to be the example.

251
00:34:01,732 --> 00:34:04,983
Now I have seen people who are gurus, who think,

252
00:34:05,192 --> 00:34:07,983
call themselves gurus, in different varieties and different

253
00:34:08,234 --> 00:34:10,732
types of life: like professors, teachers,

254
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,150
you can call them, not spiritual gurus.

255
00:34:25,067 --> 00:34:27,525
They too, when they try

256
00:34:28,025 --> 00:34:31,150
to follow a mundane type of life –

257
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,732
not of something exceptional –

258
00:34:34,067 --> 00:34:38,317
then their disciples lose faith in them.

259
00:34:52,858 --> 00:34:56,067
Even political leaders, when they…

260
00:34:56,317 --> 00:34:59,858
supposing a political leader is licentious, he has weaknesses,

261
00:35:00,442 --> 00:35:08,983
then the people who try to follow him have no respect.

262
00:35:20,234 --> 00:35:22,983
So they too have to have a personal character,

263
00:35:23,192 --> 00:35:26,025
a personal value system.

264
00:35:35,192 --> 00:35:38,567
So what about the spiritual gurus then?

265
00:35:42,733 --> 00:35:45,858
They have to be excellent people.

266
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:54,442
There should be no two types of life, one outside, one inside.

267
00:36:00,983 --> 00:36:05,484
When the outside and inside becomes one, then it is effortless

268
00:36:14,942 --> 00:36:17,317
and that is what one has to do –

269
00:36:17,567 --> 00:36:23,858
the inside and the outside, one has to work it out from inside.

270
00:36:29,442 --> 00:36:33,108
For that you cannot bring the outside inside,

271
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,983
but inside has to go outside.

272
00:36:40,609 --> 00:36:44,484
So this is the beginning of antar yoga, the inner yoga.

273
00:36:48,692 --> 00:36:52,942
At the second stage you have to become thoughtless.

274
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:59,732
This is very important in the West

275
00:37:00,442 --> 00:37:04,150
because they live in thoughts – they do not have other problems

276
00:37:04,484 --> 00:37:06,651
of a gross nature.

277
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:16,400
For example,

278
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:22,900
they are brought up in such a way that they are frightened of law.

279
00:37:30,525 --> 00:37:33,775
They are brought up this way – they’ll keep all their carpets clean,

280
00:37:33,983 --> 00:37:35,525
everything clean, you see,

281
00:37:35,732 --> 00:37:38,775
very particular about keeping every place clean.

282
00:37:47,858 --> 00:37:52,275
All the gross things they keep clean,

283
00:38:02,067 --> 00:38:10,983
and then when they try to adjust themselves, they adjust within.

284
00:38:16,858 --> 00:38:19,317
Outwardly they are gentlemanly,

285
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:28,359
but inside, in their thought, they are not clean.

286
00:38:30,442 --> 00:38:33,733
In their behaviour they are not clean, their eyes are not clean,

287
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:39,108
it’s poison inside.

288
00:38:40,442 --> 00:38:43,025
And they like that poison to be taken out –

289
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:46,067
sometimes it comes out as sarcasm,

290
00:38:50,234 --> 00:38:55,234
it comes out as their sinister acts of aggression on other countries.

291
00:39:02,025 --> 00:39:05,359
They may plan out the complete destruction of the world

292
00:39:10,067 --> 00:39:14,150
and they don’t think there’s anything wrong in it

293
00:39:16,567 --> 00:39:19,359
because it is ‘an ideology’ for which, is a thought

294
00:39:19,609 --> 00:39:20,900
they are fighting for.

295
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,442
As long as there is an ideology, there’s a thought,

296
00:39:31,692 --> 00:39:35,651
there’s some sort of a sublime talk, then they can do what they like.

297
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:50,192
This filth is very sophisticated.

298
00:39:54,192 --> 00:39:57,150
Like the people who don’t take their baths can use some

299
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:01,567
artificial things to get a fragrance.

300
00:40:05,525 --> 00:40:07,816
Inside has to be clean

301
00:40:09,692 --> 00:40:14,732
and that’s why first the efforts are to be made to have good thoughts.

302
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:22,983
Watch your mind –

303
00:40:24,858 --> 00:40:27,732
how does it think about others?

304
00:40:29,816 --> 00:40:34,609
I would say, racialism is one of the diseases of the same thing.

305
00:40:40,651 --> 00:40:44,067
I have seen people who are very well placed,

306
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,900
sophisticated, wear immaculate dresses:

307
00:40:47,192 --> 00:40:53,775
when it comes to a person from a developing country,  or from say,

308
00:40:54,025 --> 00:40:59,983
another colour complexion, they come out with a remark,

309
00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:05,900
even if they are Sahaja Yogis I have seen they do it.

310
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:27,150
I am saying this for the Sahaja Yogis and not for others.

311
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:36,900
That suddenly that dead stuff, which we call as dead, becomes alive.

312
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:48,192
So the mind is dirty,

313
00:41:49,525 --> 00:41:56,400
full of lust, greed, and anger, jealousy –

314
00:41:59,858 --> 00:42:04,900
and that’s why we have to be very, very careful.
Those people who have become sophisticated

315
00:42:05,192 --> 00:42:08,567
their weaknesses have also become sophisticated,

316
00:42:14,858 --> 00:42:18,275
and that’s why jealousy is a common disease.

317
00:42:21,525 --> 00:42:24,234
Like the other day I asked someone,

318
00:42:24,442 --> 00:42:27,275
“Why the father is angry with the son,

319
00:42:34,359 --> 00:42:37,359
and with his own brother?”

320
00:42:37,732 --> 00:42:39,733
So the answer was, “Because

321
00:42:40,067 --> 00:42:44,317
the brother is looking after the son in London.”

322
00:43:06,108 --> 00:43:09,150
Normally any person should be thankful

323
00:43:09,442 --> 00:43:13,858
that: somebody is looking after my son in my absence.

324
00:43:19,067 --> 00:43:21,775
But the fellow is jealous

325
00:43:22,067 --> 00:43:24,983
because of possessiveness

326
00:43:25,442 --> 00:43:28,525
and the possessiveness comes out of insecurity,

327
00:43:31,484 --> 00:43:34,400
and insecurity comes within us

328
00:43:34,732 --> 00:43:37,900
because we make others insecured.

329
00:43:45,651 --> 00:43:49,442
There are many reasons for insecurity,  but one of them is

330
00:43:49,609 --> 00:43:53,733
because we are ugly and we see that ugliness in others.

331
00:44:06,525 --> 00:44:09,816
Now this inside filth has to be taken out

332
00:44:10,067 --> 00:44:13,442
with greater effort than the outside filth,

333
00:44:21,442 --> 00:44:24,651
and that inside filth

334
00:44:25,067 --> 00:44:28,317
you can watch and see within yourself.

335
00:44:38,732 --> 00:44:42,359
Some people try to dominate others, to tell them things –

336
00:44:42,609 --> 00:44:45,317
just for the bossiness of it.

337
00:44:57,317 --> 00:45:02,275
Now watch out – first of all, have you bossed yourself enough?

338
00:45:07,733 --> 00:45:10,942
Have you mastered yourself enough?

339
00:45:13,192 --> 00:45:18,192
Are you master of your own or you are still lacking in that?

340
00:45:26,192 --> 00:45:29,400
Those who have not mastered themselves want to have others,

341
00:45:29,692 --> 00:45:32,234
to master them.

342
00:45:39,775 --> 00:45:44,942
But the one who is the master of oneself, need not master anyone.

343
00:45:47,816 --> 00:45:50,858
He becomes the master.

344
00:45:51,567 --> 00:45:54,775
He doesn’t have to put in any effort, he masters.

345
00:45:59,567 --> 00:46:02,732
And there are so many tricks by which he can master,

346
00:46:07,816 --> 00:46:12,067
so many things by which he can correct.

347
00:46:17,317 --> 00:46:24,484
He may not say, he may not do anything, but just he manages.

348
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:35,400
Everyone learns a lesson without his doing anything about it.

349
00:46:43,942 --> 00:46:48,525
But they know that somebody is a master of masters.

350
00:46:53,816 --> 00:46:56,359
Maybe, such a person will be very unassuming

351
00:46:56,609 --> 00:46:59,108
simple, innocent looking,

352
00:47:09,442 --> 00:47:14,567
but that’s Mahamaya, that’s the illusion.

353
00:47:15,816 --> 00:47:22,609
So, the person who is that power doesn’t want to show it outside,

354
00:47:31,525 --> 00:47:39,484
on the contrary, it shows in such a way that people know it.

355
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,025
I mean, the way things happen in life,

356
00:47:52,317 --> 00:47:56,858
we start understanding that we don’t have to put up any show –

357
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:09,942
someone knows everything.

358
00:48:12,609 --> 00:48:17,651
When we have someone like that, try to follow.

359
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:30,525
So, in the third stage the effort should be to follow your Guru

360
00:48:38,442 --> 00:48:41,234
who is a Sat Guru.

361
00:48:45,025 --> 00:48:51,651
Now that one becomes the one…a pattern, which you have to follow.

362
00:48:55,775 --> 00:48:59,900
But in this also Sahaja Yogis can be very superficial.

363
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:09,317
One of the Sahaja Yogis used to wear a shawl in a particular way.

364
00:49:09,651 --> 00:49:12,025
So, I sent him some other sahaja yogis that

365
00:49:12,317 --> 00:49:15,733
he will try to help them, he can be their guru;

366
00:49:16,525 --> 00:49:20,900
they all started wearing shawls the same way.

367
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:46,108
It’s not the outside; you have to follow the inside.

368
00:49:48,732 --> 00:49:56,732
So when you become the guru, become the guru, you become.

369
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:06,442
It’s such a short method – just to become.

370
00:50:08,525 --> 00:50:10,651
Now if you face yourself, you’ll know

371
00:50:10,816 --> 00:50:14,067
that there are still some steps you have to cross to become.

372
00:50:19,692 --> 00:50:21,900
Even now when I am lecturing to you,

373
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:25,484
you are thinking of others – “Oh, Mother is talking about him” –

374
00:50:25,733 --> 00:50:27,692
not about yourself.

375
00:50:38,525 --> 00:50:41,609
That is how one has to take it inside, the absorption

376
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:45,525
from your Guru, that you have to see yourself.

377
00:50:54,025 --> 00:50:57,732
Now, that is very important

378
00:50:57,942 --> 00:51:03,733
if we have to become the prophets who will make others prophets.

379
00:51:12,067 --> 00:51:18,484
Now, the higher stage is that your Guru becomes a Deity.

380
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:23,442
When you say “Guru Brahma, Guru Vishnu, Guru Devo Maheshwara“.

381
00:51:23,732 --> 00:51:26,567
They go up to that point but nobody says “Guru is Devi”.

382
00:51:26,858 --> 00:51:31,442
You can have a higher stage, than Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha.

383
00:51:47,108 --> 00:51:52,651
Because the Guru state is where you have the innocence of all these

384
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:57,651
Brahma and Mahesha and Vishnu –

385
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,651
their power of innocence.

386
00:52:10,983 --> 00:52:15,025
But then ultimately they say, “Guru Sakshat Parabrahma”.

387
00:52:21,567 --> 00:52:24,158
And Parabrahma is the power of the Mother

388
00:52:24,711 --> 00:52:28,502
Not only by becoming but now,

389
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:32,502
becoming the reflector of your Deity,

390
00:52:41,168 --> 00:52:48,711
to develop yourself into the reflector from guru to that state.

391
00:53:02,168 --> 00:53:06,669
At that state you start controlling all the elements.

392
00:53:12,669 --> 00:53:18,627
That’s why all these incarnations of Adi Guru

393
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,043
had control over elements.

394
00:53:27,252 --> 00:53:33,627
Brahmadeva is absolutely manifested through them.

395
00:53:37,627 --> 00:53:43,377
So out of Ganesha, which is the Adi Guru,

396
00:53:44,210 --> 00:53:46,793
He is born,

397
00:53:47,085 --> 00:53:52,252
or He is manifested through these three – Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha –

398
00:54:03,627 --> 00:54:11,294
and then He comes out as Brahmadeva with four heads,

399
00:54:18,627 --> 00:54:24,711
three of Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha, and the fourth of Shri Ganesh.

400
00:54:33,918 --> 00:54:38,294
So Brahmadeva becomes the symbol of Guru,

401
00:54:42,252 --> 00:54:48,002
and as you know Ganesha is chatvari, is four –all the time.

402
00:54:48,294 --> 00:54:52,627
He becomes these four – in expression, in manifestation.

403
00:55:00,085 --> 00:55:04,043
And as you become Brahmadeva, at that stage

404
00:55:04,335 --> 00:55:07,210
you control all the elements.

405
00:55:16,711 --> 00:55:20,960
So, today I have tried to explain to you the different

406
00:55:21,252 --> 00:55:28,168
stages of gurupada – the state of guru.

407
00:55:35,168 --> 00:55:41,835
And one should understand whatever we are today,

408
00:55:43,168 --> 00:55:48,419
we are extremely blessed and fortunate people

409
00:55:57,085 --> 00:56:02,419
that, in this short time, you started from a scratch

410
00:56:02,793 --> 00:56:08,918
in the mud and you have become the lotuses.

411
00:56:17,793 --> 00:56:21,419
The lotus will invite many insects

412
00:56:22,168 --> 00:56:26,252
and will convert them into lotuses.

413
00:56:30,043 --> 00:56:32,210
madhukar they call it, madhukar,

414
00:56:32,502 --> 00:56:36,711
the ones who are selecting the madhu, the nectar,

415
00:56:37,043 --> 00:56:39,377
the… what do you call? – the honey.

416
00:56:54,627 --> 00:56:59,377
When they get the nectar, they become themselves the lotuses.

417
00:57:08,711 --> 00:57:16,419
The whole dirty, filthy pond is covered with those lotus flowers.

418
00:57:25,752 --> 00:57:29,627
And one lotus, who is the Guru, grows higher,

419
00:57:32,752 --> 00:57:40,127
and then is given to the Goddess on which She resides.

420
00:57:48,544 --> 00:57:53,585
She resides in the heart on the platform,

421
00:57:53,876 --> 00:57:57,085
beautiful platform that this lotus has created.

422
00:58:02,544 --> 00:58:07,711
But to bear Her on your heart, you have to have a heart.

423
00:58:14,043 --> 00:58:17,792
There are so many qualities of a Guru, which I have told you.

424
00:58:18,043 --> 00:58:24,252
All the best qualities, the twelve qualities of all the sides

425
00:58:24,711 --> 00:58:28,168
should be completely manifested in a Guru,

426
00:58:35,168 --> 00:58:39,127
and the owner of those qualities is Shiva.

427
00:58:43,168 --> 00:58:45,752
So that is how the essence of Shiva,

428
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:49,043
out of Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha, the Mahesha’s qualities,

429
00:58:49,294 --> 00:58:51,043
should shine through you.

430
00:59:01,127 --> 00:59:02,918
The Vishnu’s qualities of Dharma –

431
00:59:03,127 --> 00:59:06,960
first you have to make an effort to be dharmic, to be balanced.

432
00:59:15,544 --> 00:59:18,876
Then you ascend.

433
00:59:20,792 --> 00:59:24,711
Then you become one with the Viraata

434
00:59:27,127 --> 00:59:31,752
and then you can give Dharma to others.

435
00:59:36,585 --> 00:59:40,085
So one has to know that stage-by-stage it happens to you

436
00:59:40,335 --> 00:59:42,835
and you do not become a hypocrite.

437
00:59:49,918 --> 00:59:52,752
But you become real

438
00:59:55,377 --> 01:00:00,835
and the reality is shown by its own being.

439
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:06,502
That is how you become.

440
01:00:07,419 --> 01:00:12,043
So understand the reality within yourself, face it, solve it.

441
01:00:12,377 --> 01:00:14,918
But mostly, I have seen, when I tell anybody,

442
01:00:15,085 --> 01:00:16,502
“No, Mother I am not like that.

443
01:00:16,752 --> 01:00:19,960
No Mother, I didn’t say like that, that is not true!”

444
01:00:34,419 --> 01:00:37,043
Some such people would like to sit in front

445
01:00:37,294 --> 01:00:39,544
or sort of try to show off or anything,

446
01:00:39,752 --> 01:00:40,792
but that is not important.

447
01:00:40,918 --> 01:00:43,210
What is important is how much you know yourself,

448
01:00:43,377 --> 01:00:45,210
it is Self-realisation.

449
01:00:56,835 --> 01:01:01,335
Once you develop that, then you know the others in the real way

450
01:01:05,711 --> 01:01:07,460
and not artificially,

451
01:01:08,544 --> 01:01:11,792
and then the enjoyment is complete.

452
01:01:14,252 --> 01:01:19,669
Like a bee will never go to an artificial flower.

453
01:01:23,127 --> 01:01:26,585
But human beings have to become the bee.

454
01:01:31,210 --> 01:01:39,792
The Guru does not need to say that he’s the Guru.

455
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:46,585
Today I bless you.

456
01:01:52,002 --> 01:01:56,792
I have completed the twelve years of Guru’s

457
01:01:58,835 --> 01:02:03,585
and you should really assume the Shiva’s powers within yourself

458
01:02:18,711 --> 01:02:26,210
I, that is My body, My mind, My heart,

459
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:34,752
everything, has spared no efforts

460
01:02:36,585 --> 01:02:43,876
to completely indulge into this cleansing, into this making,

461
01:02:44,294 --> 01:02:47,627
into this becoming of you people.

462
01:02:56,585 --> 01:03:04,502
I request you now that please do not waste My efforts.

463
01:03:08,711 --> 01:03:12,585
Look at yourself, help yourself

464
01:03:14,377 --> 01:03:20,377
and try to rise higher and higher to become your Self.

465
01:03:24,627 --> 01:03:28,419
When you become your Self, then you become the Guru.

466
01:03:32,043 --> 01:03:33,918
And once you become the Guru,

467
01:03:34,127 --> 01:03:38,793
you become Brahmadeva , Mahesha and Vishnu.

468
01:03:45,793 --> 01:03:51,210
So first you are made in the pattern of Ganesha,

469
01:03:52,002 --> 01:03:55,335
then Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha.

470
01:04:00,752 --> 01:04:05,419
But very much depends on your readiness to do it

471
01:04:09,502 --> 01:04:16,669
and, most of all, your honesty and sincerity.

472
01:04:17,876 --> 01:04:21,669
I hope Shri Ganesha will give you the wisdom

473
01:04:25,127 --> 01:04:28,252
to understand.

474
01:04:28,792 --> 01:04:34,127
The Shakti will give you shakti to work hard,

475
01:04:37,793 --> 01:04:43,168
and Shiva will give you joy, Sadashiva will give you the joy

476
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:48,835
