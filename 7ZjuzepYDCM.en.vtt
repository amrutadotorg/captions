00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:07.999
Shri Diwali Puja,Temisoara - Romania
25th October 1992.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.999
I think they all understand Russian. Great.

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:19.917
The Diwali Puja.

00:00:23.834 --> 00:00:28.291
Can you all hear?

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.959
Ask them can they hear.

00:00:32.125 --> 00:00:34.917
Again say. Again translate.

00:00:35.208 --> 00:00:35.875
They can't hear.

00:00:36.083 --> 00:00:38.834
You again say that: today we are celebrating ...

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:46.917
All right.

00:00:52.875 --> 00:00:56.999
Just find out if they can hear you.

00:01:09.667 --> 00:01:12.417
I think you all can try to learn English

00:01:12.667 --> 00:01:14.709
which is a very simple language

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:17.250
and would be better.

00:01:20.917 --> 00:01:21.999
Sit down, sit here.

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:25.959
Yes. Just sit facing Me here, facing Me,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
facing towards Me. Hello.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.959
Just facing towards Me if you sit, it is better.

00:01:36.208 --> 00:01:39.999
No, that's all right. Now come. It's all right.

00:01:40.083 --> 00:01:42.083
Facing towards Me, not towards them.

00:01:42.291 --> 00:01:46.999
Face towards Me. Just face.

00:01:47.166 --> 00:01:49.999
Yes, there is seats here.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.166
I just want to say that you all can learn English language,

00:01:57.458 --> 00:01:59.999
it's not difficult, from My tapes.

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:07.083
From My tapes.

00:02:08.792 --> 00:02:13.875
They can learn, try to learn, this language from My tapes.

00:02:25.083 --> 00:02:27.083
If you sit facing Me, you will ...

00:02:27.375 --> 00:02:28.917
Just face Me, then it's better.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.999
Completely face Me, don't sit with the angle.

00:02:32.041 --> 00:02:33.667
Yes it's all right.

00:02:34.333 --> 00:02:37.166
Now... Can you say?

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:52.000
Of course the language of love is universal,

00:03:03.166 --> 00:03:09.500
for it has no script, that's the problem,

00:03:13.166 --> 00:03:15.333
and no words.

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:30.709
Yogini: Shri Mataji, I'm sorry.  I'm so ...

00:03:31.583 --> 00:03:32.667
Tired.

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.166
Yogini:  Not tired.  Full of emotions.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.125
Too full of emotions.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.166
Can't to catch Your words, you see.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.999
Mix everything, all languages in my head.

00:03:45.208 --> 00:03:47.999
May ask someone to translate.

00:03:48.166 --> 00:03:49.999
I feel like I cannot catch the words

00:03:50.083 --> 00:03:55.125
No you'll be all right. Come along.

00:04:15.125 --> 00:04:17.999
I don't know how to express,

00:04:18.208 --> 00:04:22.125
I am also full of lots of emotions.

00:04:34.083 --> 00:04:39.792
It's such a beautiful gathering we have here

00:04:40.083 --> 00:04:42.625
from all over the world.

00:04:50.083 --> 00:04:56.000
We are all bound together in such pure love.

00:05:13.083 --> 00:05:16.375
And Russians also have arrived, luckily.

00:05:17.041 --> 00:05:19.458
They had to go through some tapasya.

00:05:37.166 --> 00:05:42.417
The significance of Diwali is spread out in about five days.

00:05:57.792 --> 00:05:59.999
Yogi:  Shri Mataji, Svetlana from Leningrad is here.

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.917
She's there?  Svetlana, come along.

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:04.999
Are you all right?

00:06:29.083 --> 00:06:31.375
Take it easy.

00:06:54.083 --> 00:06:57.125
And they are all together, somehow.

00:06:58.083 --> 00:07:01.083
These five days are all put together.

00:07:10.333 --> 00:07:12.375
So they have different aspects,

00:07:20.125 --> 00:07:25.291
but in every aspect there's one common point,

00:07:25.542 --> 00:07:28.999
is that the Goddess is that the Goddess plays the main role.

00:07:40.999 --> 00:07:45.999
Now the first day is the worship of the housewife,

00:07:54.333 --> 00:07:58.625
where you have to buy some sort of a utensil for the

00:07:58.834 --> 00:08:00.709
kitchen or for the use of the wife,

00:08:00.999 --> 00:08:02.999
or could be a present for the wife.

00:08:14.166 --> 00:08:19.125
But is said that women must be respected,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.667
but they should be respectable.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:31.999
If they are not respectable, how can they be respected?

00:08:36.125 --> 00:08:39.166
Now I have to warn you all people to be careful with

00:08:39.375 --> 00:08:41.583
the Western influence.

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:53.000
In the Western influence, money has become everything.

00:08:53.291 --> 00:08:56.250
Yogini: Mother, sorry, he did not translate into Romanian.

00:08:57.041 --> 00:08:58.999
Yogini: He did not translate into Romanian.

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:00.166
What are you saying?

00:09:01.333 --> 00:09:03.375
Yogini: He did not translate into Romanian.

00:09:03.583 --> 00:09:04.417
I am only translating.

00:09:04.709 --> 00:09:07.041
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:09:22.166 --> 00:09:26.083
Because in the West, money has become everything.

00:09:34.041 --> 00:09:36.999
The morality, the character,

00:09:37.208 --> 00:09:41.041
all the value system is all finished,

00:09:47.125 --> 00:09:52.166
so we as Sahaja yogis have to stop all that.

00:10:05.999 --> 00:10:06.999
Done it?

00:10:07.291 --> 00:10:08.458
Yogini: He translated.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.959
Let him do first, and then you do it. It's easier for Me.

00:10:17.999 --> 00:10:21.500
Now the first thing we have to understand that

00:10:21.999 --> 00:10:29.999
the society is completely dependent on the Gruha Lakshmis,

00:10:43.542 --> 00:10:49.917
that means a housewife has to be a very lady

00:10:50.166 --> 00:10:53.625
of great character, respectability and dignity.

00:11:01.291 --> 00:11:04.125
Society is her responsibility.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.959
She's responsible for creating peace, understanding,

00:11:21.041 --> 00:11:25.500
and for giving full idea as to what is love.

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:44.917
I think her responsibility is much more difficult, subtler,

00:11:45.166 --> 00:11:47.250
than that of men,

00:11:57.166 --> 00:12:02.417
and she's the shakti of the family,

00:12:09.999 --> 00:12:13.999
so she should not try to behave in a manner

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:18.250
that is not dignified or matured.

00:12:30.166 --> 00:12:32.999
Say for example,

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:37.417
every woman wants to become the mother,

00:12:45.166 --> 00:12:49.709
but in the Western country many women don't want.

00:12:57.999 --> 00:13:01.000
Specially in America,

00:13:05.125 --> 00:13:09.709
because they think by that their body will be spoiled

00:13:09.999 --> 00:13:12.125
or something will happen that

00:13:12.375 --> 00:13:15.333
may their husbands may not be attracted towards them.

00:13:28.999 --> 00:13:31.709
So there's all the time the mad race going on

00:13:31.999 --> 00:13:33.709
between husband and wife.

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:46.083
Husband is running after many women

00:13:46.375 --> 00:13:47.291
and many women are,

00:13:47.542 --> 00:13:51.750
the women are also running after men,

00:14:05.999 --> 00:14:08.375
or they dominate their husband.

00:14:15.999 --> 00:14:20.999
In this mad race the children are neglected,

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:24.458
the household is neglected and there's always quarrel

00:14:24.709 --> 00:14:26.333
going on between the two.

00:14:44.625 --> 00:14:51.999
So women should not try to be so subservient

00:14:52.291 --> 00:14:55.458
about this kind of mad race.

00:15:04.875 --> 00:15:06.875
They should keep their dignity,

00:15:07.458 --> 00:15:08.917
they should keep their character.

00:15:09.375 --> 00:15:11.208
They should look after their children,

00:15:11.417 --> 00:15:13.917
not bothering about their husbands.

00:15:27.291 --> 00:15:33.083
Now the worst thing that is very much acceptedis a divorce,

00:15:33.417 --> 00:15:36.625
and so the men they are afraid that men will divorce them

00:15:36.834 --> 00:15:38.125
and they'll be left in the lurch.

00:15:50.375 --> 00:15:53.542
But always in the West there is a provision,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.041
if a husband marries some other woman or something,

00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:01.208
children and the mother are given sufficient money

00:16:01.291 --> 00:16:02.375
to look after them.

00:16:21.959 --> 00:16:24.999
Under such circumstances the women should try

00:16:25.375 --> 00:16:27.583
to correct their husbands and fight for it,

00:16:27.999 --> 00:16:30.583
but, if they do not come round

00:16:30.834 --> 00:16:32.333
they should get completely detached.

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:45.875
If the husband wants to go to hell, let him go.

00:16:46.083 --> 00:16:47.667
Why do you want to do the same?

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:02.999
After all you have your dharma,

00:17:03.208 --> 00:17:05.166
you have your own life

00:17:05.709 --> 00:17:08.709
and you should just worry about yourself,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.083
and if he doesn't understand you, forget it.

00:17:32.083 --> 00:17:34.999
Such a irresponsible and a stupid fellow

00:17:35.208 --> 00:17:37.333
should be just pitied,

00:17:47.917 --> 00:17:50.834
but one should not follow the footsteps of the husband,

00:17:57.999 --> 00:18:01.166
because you have a much wider responsibility.

00:18:09.999 --> 00:18:14.917
One should not try to look younger

00:18:15.083 --> 00:18:18.999
and just all the time make your life miserable

00:18:19.166 --> 00:18:23.291
by trying to keep your husband attached to you,

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.500
because by that you will lose your powers, your shakti.

00:18:53.625 --> 00:18:55.999
But if your husband is a man of character

00:18:56.208 --> 00:18:57.166
then you must respect him

00:18:57.417 --> 00:18:59.291
and support him in every way,

00:19:11.417 --> 00:19:14.250
and tolerate him as far as possible.

00:19:22.041 --> 00:19:25.792
Yesterday I saw many ladies have cut their hair.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.041
Please do not play into the hands of these entrepreneurs,

00:19:47.917 --> 00:19:51.083
they know how to ...befool you.

00:19:57.583 --> 00:20:02.250
I have seen horrible things happening because

00:20:02.333 --> 00:20:08.125
these entrepreneurs try to entice by advertisement.

00:20:21.917 --> 00:20:23.583
Recently in Paris they said

00:20:23.875 --> 00:20:26.250
we should have six inches of skirts,

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.041
and nowhere we could get long skirts.

00:20:44.917 --> 00:20:46.917
Imagine in all these cold countries

00:20:48.083 --> 00:20:50.375
so many have got varicose veins.

00:21:04.083 --> 00:21:10.250
They start styles for hair, for body, for faces,

00:21:10.542 --> 00:21:13.208
they start all kinds of nonsense, but Sahaja yogis

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:17.917
Sahaja yoginis should understand what are they up to.

00:21:41.542 --> 00:21:43.959
You should not fall into their traps at all.

00:21:51.999 --> 00:21:53.917
So you are the goddess of the family,

00:21:54.041 --> 00:21:58.166
you have the shakti and you have to be very careful.

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:15.792
Moreover you are Sahaja yoginis,

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:18.583
so you shouldn't allow your Sahasrara

00:22:18.834 --> 00:22:20.333
to be touched by anyone.

00:22:28.542 --> 00:22:31.458
And your power comes from your chastity.

00:22:39.667 --> 00:22:42.500
Thousands of women in India committed suicide

00:22:42.792 --> 00:22:45.166
because they didn't want any man to touch their body.

00:23:00.917 --> 00:23:02.583
Now you are in Sahaja culture,

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:05.333
and in Sahaja culture we have to behave

00:23:05.625 --> 00:23:08.959
in a very dignified, matured manner.

00:23:22.125 --> 00:23:27.834
When you are small girls you are also goddesses,

00:23:28.083 --> 00:23:30.542
that time you are innocent.

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:45.583
Then you get married.

00:23:45.917 --> 00:23:49.917
It's a very big thing that you are a married woman,

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:51.250
is very auspicious.

00:24:05.542 --> 00:24:07.959
Then after marriage you have children.

00:24:08.208 --> 00:24:12.417
It's even, even greater honor for you,

00:24:23.417 --> 00:24:25.125
because you are mothers.

00:24:30.333 --> 00:24:32.375
We are not actresses,

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.999
we are mothers

00:24:42.083 --> 00:24:46.125
and you should be proud of being a mother,

00:24:52.792 --> 00:24:55.333
and you should be proud of your children.

00:25:02.166 --> 00:25:04.458
Then you become grandmothers.

00:25:08.625 --> 00:25:11.375
I think this is a very great achievement

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:21.999
and you should feel very proud of your age,

00:25:28.375 --> 00:25:30.542
that you are a grandmother.

00:25:35.709 --> 00:25:40.041
If you will go on struggling for looking young,

00:25:40.083 --> 00:25:41.834
you'll look very old.

00:25:54.125 --> 00:25:58.208
You'll see your Mother is seventy years of age

00:25:58.709 --> 00:26:01.959
and I don't look My age, that's what they say.

00:26:15.333 --> 00:26:17.959
I have never bothered about My looks.

00:26:27.125 --> 00:26:28.999
I have no time,

00:26:29.999 --> 00:26:31.999
I have so many children.

00:26:32.999 --> 00:26:35.750
I have no time, I have so many children.

00:26:43.542 --> 00:26:46.583
And I'm very proud of My age also.

00:26:56.999 --> 00:27:01.709
With age you grow, you mature, you are wiser,

00:27:11.041 --> 00:27:14.083
then you have all the assets of your personality.

00:27:21.917 --> 00:27:25.709
If you really respect your age

00:27:26.125 --> 00:27:29.125
people will come to you for advice, help,

00:27:29.375 --> 00:27:31.333
and then you can spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:48.041 --> 00:27:52.417
There are so many complications with these

00:27:52.667 --> 00:27:55.792
entrepreneurs the way they try to exploit women.

00:28:08.999 --> 00:28:13.125
On a Diwali day I don't want to talk about that,

00:28:21.875 --> 00:28:26.458
so I'll try to tell you about the Lakshmi,

00:28:26.834 --> 00:28:28.250
the symbol of Lakshmi.

00:28:39.959 --> 00:28:44.667
Shri Lakshmi is the symbol of the completeness of womanhood.

00:28:56.999 --> 00:29:01.083
She brings wealth, prosperity, auspiciousness.

00:29:11.166 --> 00:29:13.999
She brings in understanding,

00:29:15.583 --> 00:29:20.291
generosity, peace and joy.

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:34.542
She is the giver of all the blessings.

00:29:43.542 --> 00:29:47.917
The symbol of Lakshmi is that She stands on the lotus

00:29:48.125 --> 00:29:49.625
which is pink in color.

00:29:59.333 --> 00:30:05.709
Pink color is the warmth of a motherhood.

00:30:15.166 --> 00:30:19.750
In India even a small girl is called as "mother".

00:30:31.166 --> 00:30:36.208
So, in the various aspects of Lakshmi, the symbol is that

00:30:36.417 --> 00:30:40.375
first She is a very warm person;

00:30:55.083 --> 00:30:57.625
also in one hand She has the lotus

00:31:06.834 --> 00:31:09.208
which is also pink in color,

00:31:18.583 --> 00:31:22.458
that also suggestive of Her warmth.

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:35.583
Even a funny type of a moth with all kinds of thorns

00:31:35.999 --> 00:31:37.959
attached to his body

00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:41.250
enters into a lotus, he finds a place

00:31:41.625 --> 00:31:42.917
where he can rest.

00:32:02.208 --> 00:32:06.166
She makes all the guests to come in her house and

00:32:06.417 --> 00:32:10.750
have the best bed and the best food.

00:32:24.999 --> 00:32:32.458
Normally the men bring in a guest and the wife

00:32:32.709 --> 00:32:35.750
receives him and looks after him.

00:32:50.792 --> 00:32:57.000
So, it is suggestive that we have to look after

00:32:57.250 --> 00:32:59.959
any type of a guest who comes to our house,

00:33:00.208 --> 00:33:02.959
and should completely

00:33:03.917 --> 00:33:08.750
devote ourselves to the looking after of the guest

00:33:08.959 --> 00:33:10.583
who is from outside.

00:33:27.875 --> 00:33:33.250
She is standing on the lotus and wearing also a pink sari.

00:33:44.625 --> 00:33:47.458
That is, you have to have balance

00:33:47.667 --> 00:33:49.542
to stand on a thing like lotus

00:33:56.999 --> 00:33:59.750
because She's surrounded by water,

00:34:14.834 --> 00:34:19.208
and there are many animals around it;

00:34:25.417 --> 00:34:30.417
beast-like people who try to entice Her,

00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:40.750
so She has to have a complete balance.

00:34:50.083 --> 00:34:56.583
Also She has two hands with the lotus

00:34:56.875 --> 00:35:02.417
and with two other hands She is giving,

00:35:02.625 --> 00:35:06.041
and with another hand She's blessing.

00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:28.792
This one means that she should be generous,

00:35:28.999 --> 00:35:32.875
she should be giving always to others, not for herself.

00:35:40.999 --> 00:35:43.250
She should not spend all the money on herself

00:35:43.542 --> 00:35:47.000
and nothing for the children or for the guests or for others.

00:35:57.625 --> 00:36:00.959
So it is the Lakshmi who has to give,

00:36:01.208 --> 00:36:02.417
who has to be generous.

00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:19.500
I have seen those people in Sahaja Yoga are generous,

00:36:19.917 --> 00:36:23.999
their wives may not be, and then they suffer a lot.

00:36:40.291 --> 00:36:43.875
But if the wife is generous, she's rewarded,

00:36:44.125 --> 00:36:46.208
the whole family is rewarded hundred times.

00:36:57.959 --> 00:37:01.875
Generosity is like this, that you have one door open

00:37:02.125 --> 00:37:03.999
through which everything is coming in,

00:37:05.041 --> 00:37:08.417
and you open another door by giving,

00:37:08.667 --> 00:37:10.542
so there's a very good circulation.

00:37:35.709 --> 00:37:42.625
I enjoy My generosity the most, if it is generosity,

00:38:02.041 --> 00:38:05.999
and you all should enjoy this generosity,

00:38:14.333 --> 00:38:18.250
and generosity is so rewarding,

00:38:18.542 --> 00:38:23.083
so rewarding that it is unbelievable

00:38:23.291 --> 00:38:28.500
how the divine forces help a person who is generous.

00:38:48.834 --> 00:38:50.750
I'll give an example.

00:38:50.959 --> 00:38:52.834
I had a friend

00:38:53.125 --> 00:38:56.250
who said she wanted a sari from the foreign countries,

00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:57.999
these imported saris;

00:39:13.417 --> 00:39:19.166
and I had two of them and I told a another lady

00:39:19.417 --> 00:39:20.875
who was very miserly that

00:39:21.083 --> 00:39:23.500
I would like to give away these two saris to her.

00:39:33.166 --> 00:39:36.500
So she said, "You have only these two left now,

00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:38.083
why do You want to give her this sari?"

00:39:38.291 --> 00:39:40.041
She was miserly type.

00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:55.333
We were talking in the kitchen,

00:40:09.792 --> 00:40:13.750
but somebody rang the bell and I opened the door.

00:40:22.667 --> 00:40:28.250
He had brought two saris from Africa,

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:34.083
because some lady who had gone to Africa had sent them.

00:40:48.583 --> 00:40:51.625
So I said, "Why did she send Me saris?"

00:40:52.333 --> 00:40:55.250
He said, "Because You had given her saris when

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:57.291
she went, so she has sent You these."

00:41:13.208 --> 00:41:16.458
And when I opened the saris they were exactly the same,

00:41:16.458 --> 00:41:18.125
the ones I had with Me.

00:41:35.125 --> 00:41:38.125
So I took out both the saris and showed her,

00:41:38.417 --> 00:41:40.959
"See, this is the example."

00:41:54.333 --> 00:41:56.333
This is how it is, always.

00:41:56.625 --> 00:42:01.291
Everything comes back to you when you are kind

00:42:01.583 --> 00:42:04.208
to others, or if you are generous to others.

00:42:19.417 --> 00:42:24.041
You will find later on yourself, and so many have already

00:42:24.333 --> 00:42:27.375
found that just money flows to them.

00:42:41.291 --> 00:42:44.041
They can't understand from where the money is coming.

00:42:50.834 --> 00:42:55.041
Just it works out that you get money,

00:43:04.417 --> 00:43:05.583
whenever you want.

00:43:10.083 --> 00:43:12.375
You should not worry about money.

00:43:17.834 --> 00:43:20.999
Just forget it and it comes to you.

00:43:29.834 --> 00:43:33.166
People who are meticulously counting their money

00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:35.208
all the time, every morning,

00:43:43.625 --> 00:43:46.250
are never satisfied and also

00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:49.500
they haven't got the blessings of any kind.

00:44:00.999 --> 00:44:06.959
But if you'll just keep the worry of money to God,

00:44:07.083 --> 00:44:08.750
everything works out.

00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:24.625
So what do we understand?

00:44:24.875 --> 00:44:28.125
That it is all in the hands of God Almighty.

00:44:39.291 --> 00:44:41.583
After coming to Sahaja Yoga

00:44:41.625 --> 00:44:45.000
you don't have to worry about anything.

00:44:45.250 --> 00:44:47.041
Leave it in the hands of God

00:45:01.667 --> 00:45:04.125
and everything will work out.

00:45:09.917 --> 00:45:17.125
There is no need for you to go on telling people that

00:45:17.333 --> 00:45:19.583
"Oh, I am so much worried, I have no money,

00:45:19.792 --> 00:45:20.792
I have no money."

00:45:31.375 --> 00:45:34.375
That shows that you are not yet Sahaja yogis.

00:45:41.333 --> 00:45:47.834
So, if you have to improve those who are your neighbors

00:45:48.083 --> 00:45:49.917
or your friends or your country,

00:45:50.083 --> 00:45:54.125
first of all you have to be very mature Sahaja yoginis.

00:46:14.959 --> 00:46:18.542
So the Lakshmi is already awakened within you.

00:46:27.792 --> 00:46:31.250
She resides in your Nabhi Chakra.

00:46:39.959 --> 00:46:43.166
So with your Lakshmi awakened,

00:46:43.417 --> 00:46:45.166
why should you worry about money?

00:46:59.959 --> 00:47:08.750
So then, this last, Her symbolic hand She says that

00:47:08.999 --> 00:47:11.125
"Those who are under your protection,

00:47:11.333 --> 00:47:12.417
you must look after them."

00:47:40.083 --> 00:47:44.208
That means you have to bless everyone

00:47:44.417 --> 00:47:45.709
who comes in contact with you,

00:47:57.625 --> 00:48:00.583
and you have to worry about all the people

00:48:00.834 --> 00:48:02.917
who are under your control.

00:48:13.999 --> 00:48:18.250
So the Lakshmi symbol is not only for the ladies,

00:48:18.542 --> 00:48:20.500
but more for the men.

00:48:32.959 --> 00:48:35.875
A man who is in the business

00:48:36.041 --> 00:48:37.834
has to respect his wife and

00:48:38.041 --> 00:48:39.208
his wife should be respectable.

00:48:52.917 --> 00:48:53.959
If she is not,

00:48:54.417 --> 00:48:57.458
then auspiciousness will not come in that family.

00:49:10.083 --> 00:49:14.166
So, you get all these blessings of Lakshmi

00:49:14.709 --> 00:49:18.250
if your housewife is good person.

00:49:35.875 --> 00:49:44.125
This symbol of Lakshmi is expressing a kind of

00:49:44.417 --> 00:49:53.417
a personality that is expected of a woman or a man

00:49:53.709 --> 00:49:57.542
who have got the blessings of money.

00:50:22.667 --> 00:50:26.625
So, that is the -- I was telling you about the first day

00:50:26.875 --> 00:50:28.959
what is it, second day what is it,

00:50:29.375 --> 00:50:33.458
but main thing is that on a Diwali day

00:50:33.709 --> 00:50:36.291
we have to worship the Lakshmi.

00:50:58.166 --> 00:51:01.083
So, today when we are worshipping Lakshmi,

00:51:01.875 --> 00:51:04.834
the men also have to know that they have to have

00:51:04.999 --> 00:51:06.999
a complete balance in life,

00:51:15.834 --> 00:51:18.792
that they should be generous and look after the people

00:51:18.999 --> 00:51:21.250
who are under their control.

00:51:34.333 --> 00:51:40.083
So the there are, as I said, many aspects,

00:51:40.333 --> 00:51:42.583
but one of them, very important is that

00:51:42.999 --> 00:51:49.333
Shri Rama killed Ravanna on ten days before they say,

00:51:49.583 --> 00:51:54.583
and was crowned on the ...

00:51:55.792 --> 00:51:58.542
I mean today. He was crowned today.

00:52:19.625 --> 00:52:25.959
So His wife was Sita, She was also made the Queen,

00:52:26.250 --> 00:52:32.500
and in their life it is shown how She remained

00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:34.875
absolutely dedicated to Him.

00:52:58.208 --> 00:53:04.375
So in Sahaja culture we have to be special people.

00:53:14.375 --> 00:53:18.250
We cannot be like other people who are just running after

00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:23.750
money and doing everything just to ruin themselves.

00:53:39.333 --> 00:53:44.083
So that, in Sahaja culture we have to meditate,

00:53:44.375 --> 00:53:48.291
get our satisfaction about everything within ourselves,

00:53:48.583 --> 00:53:54.333
and also we have to be like the Lakshmi children,

00:53:54.625 --> 00:53:55.625
the children of Lakshmi.

00:54:15.458 --> 00:54:18.999
So there are two aspects of this thing we have understood

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:24.000
is that Lakshmi fulfils all our monetary needs,

00:54:24.667 --> 00:54:30.999
plus also She gives us all the balance, all the joy,

00:54:31.250 --> 00:54:33.417
all the bliss in the family.

00:54:59.667 --> 00:55:07.583
Now the problem is with us that unless and until we

00:55:07.875 --> 00:55:11.792
meditate, unless and until we reach that state of

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:16.959
satisfaction, we cannot see the work of this divine power.

00:55:39.458 --> 00:55:45.875
If all the people from Eastern countries could worship

00:55:46.583 --> 00:55:52.500
the Lakshmi or you can say worship their own Kundalini,

00:55:53.166 --> 00:56:01.083
then whole of this problem of money will be solved;

00:56:22.999 --> 00:56:27.250
and such a change will come that those countries which

00:56:27.458 --> 00:56:30.583
today do appear to be poorer than the rest

00:56:30.834 --> 00:56:32.458
of the European world,

00:56:32.667 --> 00:56:36.999
will become quite rich by the blessings of Shri Lakshmi.

00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:16.709
Now I have to take you to a very subtler side of life,

00:57:32.959 --> 00:57:37.750
and that subtler side is that with the blessings

00:57:37.999 --> 00:57:42.792
of Shri Lakshmi or Mahalakshmi, now you have achieved

00:57:43.041 --> 00:57:44.999
your Self-realization.

00:58:05.834 --> 00:58:10.667
The Mahalakshmi Principle has given you this ascent,

00:58:22.875 --> 00:58:33.709
and the Mahalakshmi Principle is that you rise much above

00:58:33.999 --> 00:58:39.083
your mundane life into the realm of Self-realization.

00:58:56.750 --> 00:59:03.458
So by Her blessings you become like lotuses yourselves.

00:59:14.709 --> 00:59:18.959
Now you become the another aspect of Diwali,

00:59:19.208 --> 00:59:22.542
which means "the rows of lights".

00:59:38.917 --> 00:59:47.792
Shri Rama's crowning or any other aspect of Shri Lakshmi

00:59:48.125 --> 00:59:53.125
here now becomes your own crowning.

01:00:01.667 --> 01:00:05.667
That is, you have now entered into the Kingdom of God,

01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:22.333
and once you are there then automatically, as the citizens

01:00:22.542 --> 01:00:26.375
of God's Kingdom, you are blessed.

01:00:42.625 --> 01:00:47.875
And as you become the lotuses then you start spreading

01:00:48.083 --> 01:00:50.166
your fragrance all around.

01:01:05.792 --> 01:01:08.125
Now you do not keep this joy to yourself

01:01:08.375 --> 01:01:10.208
but you become generous about you,

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:13.417
and you go all out to give it to others.

01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:38.417
The generosity at another level, at a lower level,

01:01:38.625 --> 01:01:43.542
is transformed into this universal love.

01:01:54.999 --> 01:02:01.834
Whatever you gain, whatever joy, satisfaction, vibrations,

01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:06.583
knowledge, all that you want to give it to others.

01:02:25.583 --> 01:02:28.583
You want to spread it because now you've got the reality

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.750
and you don't want to keep it to yourself,

01:02:30.999 --> 01:02:34.792
you think it is very important that everyone in the world

01:02:34.999 --> 01:02:36.792
should know about Reality.

01:02:55.834 --> 01:02:59.792
This is significant in putting these lights,

01:02:59.999 --> 01:03:02.500
that now you are the lights.

01:03:18.333 --> 01:03:21.291
It is the darkest night today.

01:03:22.625 --> 01:03:25.792
Tonight is the darkest night.

01:03:32.125 --> 01:03:38.000
In the same way these are the darkest days.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.500
The darkest days.

01:03:52.417 --> 01:03:53.375
Darkest.

01:03:56.700 --> 01:04:01.000
This is the Kali Yuga and it is the ghor Kali Yuga,

01:04:01.291 --> 01:04:02.959
means worst time,

01:04:10.125 --> 01:04:11.999
when the worst things are happening,

01:04:12.166 --> 01:04:15.667
human beings are going to the worst level.

01:04:24.999 --> 01:04:31.792
And at this time we have to put Sahaja Yoga before them.

01:04:40.625 --> 01:04:47.583
You know what is the ordeal one has to go through

01:04:54.959 --> 01:04:59.542
to break the hard nuts of the brains of people.

01:05:11.458 --> 01:05:15.542
But it is working, it has clicked already.

01:05:17.417 --> 01:05:18.417
It is working.

01:05:18.667 --> 01:05:19.417
It has already clicked.

01:05:19.667 --> 01:05:20.208
It has happened.

01:05:27.542 --> 01:05:31.834
Now you have to enlighten many lights.

01:05:40.083 --> 01:05:42.834
We call it "Deepawali".

01:05:42.999 --> 01:05:47.166
Diwali is Deepawali, means "the rows of lights".

01:05:58.208 --> 01:06:02.999
And by celebrating this Diwali with so many of you,

01:06:03.041 --> 01:06:08.917
I'm sure we'll have such a torch of light

01:06:09.917 --> 01:06:12.625
which will go round the whole world.

01:06:30.999 --> 01:06:33.709
Just remember you are not a small drop, now you

01:06:33.959 --> 01:06:36.917
have become the ocean and you have to spread.

01:06:52.291 --> 01:06:54.875
Now you are sitting on your thrones,

01:06:56.333 --> 01:06:59.542
and assume your powers.

01:07:09.166 --> 01:07:11.375
You have all the powers within you,

01:07:11.667 --> 01:07:13.166
you have to just manifest it.

01:07:24.417 --> 01:07:29.041
You have to just feel yourself, understand yourself,

01:07:29.291 --> 01:07:31.375
what is your responsibility.

01:07:41.999 --> 01:07:44.959
You've been asking for light, now you've got the light.

01:07:45.250 --> 01:07:47.959
You have become the light, now give light to others.

01:08:01.041 --> 01:08:06.709
So achieve a state where your light is on your head,

01:08:07.959 --> 01:08:09.458
on your Sahasrara,

01:08:22.583 --> 01:08:24.750
and that it is in your heart.

01:08:30.999 --> 01:08:33.250
You are not ordinary people.

01:08:38.375 --> 01:08:40.208
Never think that way.

01:08:45.041 --> 01:08:47.166
Actually in Sahaja Yoga

01:08:47.417 --> 01:08:50.542
only so-called "ordinary" people will come.

01:09:04.291 --> 01:09:08.041
Christ has said, "Meek in heart will inherit the earth."

01:09:31.709 --> 01:09:34.667
So you are meek in heart and you always think you are

01:09:34.709 --> 01:09:37.041
ordinary because you are humble.

01:09:50.625 --> 01:09:54.834
But the extraordinary now is manifesting, so accept it,

01:10:04.041 --> 01:10:08.291
and the extraordinary is that you have all the powers and

01:10:08.375 --> 01:10:10.959
you are absolutely humble people.

01:10:26.375 --> 01:10:33.959
Now the celebration of Diwali should be that we carry

01:10:34.041 --> 01:10:39.041
the light all over the world and enlighten people,

01:10:39.291 --> 01:10:40.999
as many as we can.

01:10:50.417 --> 01:10:52.375
None of our private things,

01:10:52.667 --> 01:10:55.959
none of our own problems are important.

01:11:13.875 --> 01:11:19.875
So that is what it is, that we have to realize that we have

01:11:20.083 --> 01:11:25.000
got a certain position which no one has in this world.

01:11:40.917 --> 01:11:46.834
So once you understand, your own esteem goes up and

01:11:47.041 --> 01:11:49.291
you see for yourself what you have to do.

01:12:04.125 --> 01:12:07.458
So then, everybody should today

01:12:07.750 --> 01:12:11.166
decide and take a oath, that we'll do

01:12:11.417 --> 01:12:15.208
everything to spread Sahaja Yoga with humility.

01:12:35.417 --> 01:12:38.667
So now we'll have the puja,

01:12:38.917 --> 01:12:42.125
and in this puja you all should promise to yourself

01:12:42.417 --> 01:12:50.166
that you will create a Deepawali in every household,

01:12:50.375 --> 01:12:54.458
in every country, in the whole world.

01:13:17.792 --> 01:13:19.166
May God bless you all.
