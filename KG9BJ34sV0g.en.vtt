00:00.440 --> 00:05.330
You develop a hypertension, you become very
agitated, you start dancing and doing all

00:05.330 --> 00:06.440
kinds of things.

00:06.440 --> 00:11.410
These things can happen – that you may start
dancing, jumping, shouting, doing all kinds

00:11.410 --> 00:13.599
of things, getting into licentiousness, permissiveness.

00:13.599 --> 00:16.540
Because that’s how you are let loose.

00:16.540 --> 00:22.220
The control on your being of the wisdom is
lost, and then you just get into it.

00:22.220 --> 00:28.030
And you don’t feel the pinch of your conscience.

00:28.030 --> 00:32.850
The pinch of the conscience is no more.

00:32.850 --> 00:38.180
You just go arbitrary and you just shoot off.

00:38.180 --> 00:41.280
It can happen to people even without feeling
this.

00:41.280 --> 00:45.309
Even without feeling this some people can
get into that kind of a mood.

00:45.309 --> 00:51.379
That’s how they become alcoholic and they
become all these things where they have no

00:51.379 --> 00:52.379
control.

00:52.379 --> 00:53.379
(break in recording)

00:53.379 --> 00:58.370
…eventually he was absolutely on [his] deathbed
because he got cirrhosis of the liver and

00:58.370 --> 00:59.469
he was going to die.

00:59.469 --> 01:06.272
He had left Sahaj Yoga, he wanted to do it
on his own and all that, and he just lost

01:06.272 --> 01:07.272
it, poor thing!

01:07.272 --> 01:08.280
Within three months he started showing results.

01:08.280 --> 01:10.980
And he was so badly off and I brought him
home.

01:10.980 --> 01:12.983
My husband had gone abroad and when he came
back he said, “What’s this?

01:12.983 --> 01:15.380
You have got a dead person in the house!

01:15.380 --> 01:18.850
They are going to prosecute us, we are all
going to be in jail.

01:18.850 --> 01:21.800
He’s going to die next moment the way he
is.

01:21.800 --> 01:23.030
I just can’t look at him!”

01:23.030 --> 01:24.030
He was very angry.

01:24.030 --> 01:25.500
I said, “Now where can I send him?

01:25.500 --> 01:29.010
After all, he’s so sick, it would be very
inhuman to send him anywhere out."

01:29.010 --> 01:33.080
He said, “All right, tomorrow you arrange
something and send him away."

01:33.080 --> 01:37.050
But next day you see when my husband got up
from his bed he saw this gentleman walking

01:37.050 --> 01:38.050
about.

01:38.050 --> 01:39.050
He was so surprised and aghast!

01:39.050 --> 01:41.690
He came in and he said, “The fellow is out,
out of his bed!

01:41.690 --> 01:44.110
I just can’t believe my eyes."

01:44.110 --> 01:47.120
And then within seven days he was completely
cured.

01:47.120 --> 01:52.050
But then Gus told me that, “Mother, some
of us are so egotistical that we have to go

01:52.050 --> 01:55.750
to that limit to know you and to come to you.

01:55.750 --> 02:00.510
It’s not possible for some people to give
up their ego and to behave in this manner,

02:00.510 --> 02:04.770
so you better allow them to go to that position
and then to come back."

02:04.770 --> 02:06.010
I said, “For a Mother it is difficult.

02:06.010 --> 02:09.619
She will try to tell them again and again
that, no, no, you try to get all right."

02:09.619 --> 02:10.830
So, that’s what he told me.

02:10.830 --> 02:11.850
But this is very true.

02:11.850 --> 02:15.890
You see, what I have found with the Western
people is that they are really egotistical

02:15.890 --> 02:20.980
in the sense that they, they don’t mind
killing themselves.

02:20.980 --> 02:26.340
The ego is so self-destroying that they know
that they are unkind to themselves but to

02:26.340 --> 02:30.040
just satisfy their ego, they’ll go on destroying
themselves.

02:30.040 --> 02:33.880
And they reach such a funny point that you
just can’t understand how they have been

02:33.880 --> 02:35.370
so foolish about it.

02:35.370 --> 02:38.360
Then he started respecting himself and then
he went to his mother.

02:38.360 --> 02:40.160
He said, “I feel tremendous love for my
mother!”

02:40.160 --> 02:41.810
Whom he had left for years.

02:41.810 --> 02:43.060
He never bothered about her.

02:43.060 --> 02:44.060
Then he went down [to Australia].

02:44.060 --> 02:46.500
Now he’s in Australia looking after his
mother and he’ll be coming back to London.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.530
I am sure he’s much better off.

02:48.530 --> 02:50.160
He writes very sweet letters.

02:50.160 --> 02:52.990
So this is what is the thing of Mr.

02:52.990 --> 02:59.599
Gus, who was the leader of all the hippies
of London and who was a very clever boy, and

02:59.599 --> 03:02.020
he was a Physics professor.

03:02.020 --> 03:06.209
And so you can imagine what can happen to
an egotistical person, how he can lose his

03:06.209 --> 03:07.440
complete wisdom.

03:07.440 --> 03:16.880
In Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan there were about
300 people out of which at least 275 people

03:16.880 --> 03:18.640
were Indians.

03:18.640 --> 03:20.870
And they were all suffering from some disease
or other.

03:20.870 --> 03:24.599
I got such a fright and I was so angry with
all of them.

03:24.599 --> 03:27.800
I said, “None of you are healthy to come
to me."

03:27.800 --> 03:34.250
Some were suffering from paralysis, some were
suffering from gout and all kinds of troubles

03:34.250 --> 03:35.250
they had.

03:35.250 --> 03:40.170
And, in that lot I found Cooly sitting in
front of me and he was absolutely cool, very,

03:40.170 --> 03:47.000
very cool: so much that he was like a frozen
dough.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.530
And I felt him and I said, “Now this is
too much!”

03:51.530 --> 03:55.849
But because of his heart catching you see.

03:55.849 --> 04:00.920
When your heart is caught up you can feel
that kind of coolness because it depresses

04:00.920 --> 04:03.120
your heart more and you get that cool there.

04:03.120 --> 04:05.020
So I called him Cooly.

04:05.020 --> 04:06.020
And [Dr.

04:06.020 --> 04:11.890
Denton] Cooley is one doctor whom you might
have heard about him, who is in Houston, where

04:11.890 --> 04:15.440
they are operating small children, and I had
taken my grandchild there.

04:15.440 --> 04:19.700
So I met him: He looked very much like our
Cooly, but he’s a very tall fellow; a very

04:19.700 --> 04:21.370
kindly person.

04:21.370 --> 04:26.350
And when I saw him I combined these two things
together because he’s was so cool and also

04:26.350 --> 04:27.910
his face so much like Dr.

04:27.910 --> 04:31.630
Cooley that I called him Cooly; and that’s
how [he got the name].

04:31.630 --> 04:37.990
And then whenever he talked to me he said,
“You remember Mother, I’m Cooly speaking."

04:37.990 --> 04:42.430
So his name became Cooly forever (laughter).

04:42.430 --> 04:44.340
Now, come along.

04:44.340 --> 04:47.510
His name is Anthony Panayiotou.

04:47.510 --> 04:52.720
He is from Cyprus, very near Greece from where
Alexander the Great came to us.

04:52.720 --> 04:57.270
And now comes ‘Cooly the Great’.

04:57.270 --> 05:01.780
But I must also give the other side of the
picture.

05:01.780 --> 05:06.020
The other side of the picture is that though
you people have one problem which I call as

05:06.020 --> 05:10.930
the sin against the Mother, also Indians have
sin against the Father, which they do not

05:10.930 --> 05:12.330
know.

05:12.330 --> 05:16.940
In London you cannot imagine someone running
away with your chappals (Indian sandals) from

05:16.940 --> 05:17.940
Caxton Hall.

05:17.940 --> 05:20.720
Nobody can even think of such nonsense!

05:20.720 --> 05:24.260
But here, how many of you have lost your chappals
in the programme?

05:24.260 --> 05:27.010
And not only you but even yesterday, poor
Mr.

05:27.010 --> 05:31.070
Pradhan lost his new shoe because where he
wore it for a function like that!

05:31.070 --> 05:36.360
This kind of an absurdity is only possible
in this wretched India, where you get all

05:36.360 --> 05:37.360
this kind of nonsense!

05:37.360 --> 05:45.590
That’s the point where I really cannot understand
that people are so much worried and upset

05:45.590 --> 05:50.290
about their belongings, about their things
and they want to grab anything that comes

05:50.290 --> 05:52.060
in their way.

05:52.060 --> 05:55.320
If they can do it without paying anything
for it, they’ll be very happy.

05:55.320 --> 05:59.400
So, in this way we are really committing sins
against the Father, who has said that He is

05:59.400 --> 06:01.560
going to look after the kshema (well-being)
also.

06:01.560 --> 06:03.160
He looks after the kshema.

06:03.160 --> 06:05.810
And while we do not believe into it that He
looks after it.

06:05.810 --> 06:07.780
We get upset for a little money spent here.

06:07.780 --> 06:10.190
We get upset for little things done there.

06:10.190 --> 06:13.560
I mean we are really, that way, very, very
funny people.

06:13.560 --> 06:20.479
Though Indians are very generous no doubt
but they do not mind taking away things without

06:20.479 --> 06:23.700
the knowledge of the person who is around.

06:23.700 --> 06:25.389
It’s something so funny!

06:25.389 --> 06:28.261
Of course, everybody does not do it but quite
a lot of [them do].

06:28.261 --> 06:32.139
But especially the people who are at the helm
of affairs are absolute cheats sometimes and

06:32.139 --> 06:35.380
are so funny that one can’t understand why
do they want to cheat?

06:35.380 --> 06:38.430
I mean, they have everything, and they have
got a lot of money.

06:38.430 --> 06:42.031
But they won’t mind taking away some money
away from you, taking away some money away

06:42.031 --> 06:43.190
from the other person.

06:43.190 --> 06:47.500
For no rhyme and reason they will expect you
to give them money and bribes and things like

06:47.500 --> 06:48.500
that.

06:48.500 --> 06:52.410
So, this is something so surprising that in
London we have taken a flat, and now you know

06:52.410 --> 06:53.410
we have taken a house.

06:53.410 --> 06:56.740
We have taken a flat from one Indian and then
we took a house in London.

06:56.740 --> 07:01.200
I didn’t have to pay any black money or
anything like that for taking this house and

07:01.200 --> 07:02.270
it worked out very well.

07:02.270 --> 07:08.050
But here it is not possible unless and until
you give them some black money and you do

07:08.050 --> 07:09.150
all kinds of nonsensical things.

07:09.150 --> 07:11.070
It’s very, very difficult!

07:11.070 --> 07:13.610
Even in England Indians try this trick with
others.

07:13.610 --> 07:19.570
If you remember our first flat fellow wanted
us to give him some money and wanted this

07:19.570 --> 07:21.479
and that, and I had a big argument with him.

07:21.479 --> 07:25.759
So, this kind of a nonsense which I call as
the sin against the Father is all the time

07:25.759 --> 07:26.759
[there].

07:26.759 --> 07:31.730
Even if they get a broken chappal somewhere,
they would carry it out.

07:31.730 --> 07:37.490
I mean, all this kind of a thing is not possible
in London: people are very, very honest and

07:37.490 --> 07:41.570
they don’t take somebody’s money like
that nor do they take away things.

07:41.570 --> 07:45.980
Here if you have the kind of newspaper distribution
you have there, people will take away the

07:45.980 --> 07:47.400
newspaper!

07:47.400 --> 07:57.600
They will take away even the container of
the money and also the cash box and also the

07:57.600 --> 08:01.370
lamppost!

08:01.370 --> 08:03.590
And they can use it for any purpose.

08:03.590 --> 08:06.520
Even I have seen people putting their bottles
out.

08:06.520 --> 08:13.199
And everything, the way we have in London,
the postal system, they send anything to you

08:13.199 --> 08:17.240
from thousands of rupees to any amount; nobody
takes it.

08:17.240 --> 08:18.650
It is kept outside your house.

08:18.650 --> 08:19.990
It is lying there.

08:19.990 --> 08:21.259
Nobody takes it!

08:21.259 --> 08:28.470
Especially in Oxted, a place of, so forlorn
and absolutely a desolate place and there

08:28.470 --> 08:32.919
also I have seen [that] if something arrived
by parcel, it would be lying there for two

08:32.919 --> 08:35.882
days, three days, if you were out and nobody
would touch it.

08:35.882 --> 08:38.060
That is not possible here at all.

08:38.060 --> 08:41.919
People would even take away locks you have,
they’ll take away the panels you have (Mother

08:41.919 --> 08:42.919
laughs).

08:42.919 --> 08:45.580
I mean, they can take away anything they feel
like.

08:45.580 --> 08:55.140
Can you imagine in India people can even take
away a small, little tap that is hanging out!

08:55.140 --> 08:57.860
From the bathrooms they’ll take away the
taps.

08:57.860 --> 09:03.400
You allow them to go wash in your washbasin,
they may take away the washbasins!

09:03.400 --> 09:05.310
Dustbins: they’ll take away your dustbins.

09:05.310 --> 09:07.210
They can take away anything!

09:07.210 --> 09:11.750
Like they are possessed by some people who
are thieves and thugs or I don’t know what!

09:11.750 --> 09:16.750
Our gurus are just the same: they don’t
mind living on opium that is other people’s

09:16.750 --> 09:17.750
money.

09:17.750 --> 09:19.340
They indulge in other people’s money all
the time.

09:19.340 --> 09:20.890
They have no shame about it.

09:20.890 --> 09:25.140
And when I say anything about it people say,
“Mother, you are very hard on them!”

09:25.140 --> 09:26.140
What should I say?

09:26.140 --> 09:30.500
Should I garland them and make an aarti out
of them that: what thugs you are, very nicely

09:30.500 --> 09:33.320
living on the people’s money?

09:33.320 --> 09:34.900
I just can’t understand what one should
say.

09:34.900 --> 09:39.330
I feel so ashamed of them, and responsible
also, the way they have really lynched all

09:39.330 --> 09:40.360
the Western seekers.

09:40.360 --> 09:44.500
And these are sadhus and they have no business
to do that!

09:44.500 --> 09:48.990
And with that they have put all the bhoots
into them and have taken all that they had.

09:48.990 --> 09:53.200
Even there are some people, one boy came to
me, he didn’t have a proper shoe on him,

09:53.200 --> 09:54.260
and he’s the son of a Lord!

09:54.260 --> 09:59.040
And he said, “Now my father has no place
for me because I stole some antiques from

09:59.040 --> 10:03.510
his house and sold them to give it to this
fellow who’s now having an airstrip for

10:03.510 --> 10:04.510
himself."

10:04.510 --> 10:06.790
Is this the way?

10:06.790 --> 10:09.720
To lynch people and take money from them and
befool them?

10:09.720 --> 10:12.720
I mean, this is really shameful, absolutely
shameful.

10:12.720 --> 10:14.240
And I am really ashamed of it.

10:14.240 --> 10:21.120
So, though we are, in a way, naïve, because
we are not yet exposed to that kind of a sex-orientated

10:21.120 --> 10:26.290
society: but it will take no time if we do
not stop it now with a complete force.

10:26.290 --> 10:31.399
It will take no time for us to get into that
horrible, perverted thing, you see.

10:31.399 --> 10:34.540
And the other day somebody asked me, “What
do you say to permissiveness and to licentiousness?”

10:34.540 --> 10:39.870
So, I said, “In our Indian language, we
call it badmashi and badchalni."

10:39.870 --> 10:42.100
This is the word we have got.

10:42.100 --> 10:45.050
I mean we have no other sensible words for
these things.

10:45.050 --> 10:47.000
They are called badchalni and badmashi.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.630
This is the word we have got.

10:48.630 --> 10:49.680
What am I to do?

10:49.680 --> 10:53.800
I mean, can you suggest some new words for
permissiveness and licentiousness?

10:53.800 --> 10:56.600
These are all horrid things!

10:56.600 --> 10:58.910
And I mean, this is regarded as something
very bad.

10:58.910 --> 11:04.790
So, this one can be twisted also, and people
can say that Mataji calls all the Westerners

11:04.790 --> 11:05.790
badmash.

11:05.790 --> 11:10.280
But if you are licentious, according to Indian
language, any language, in Marathi language,

11:10.280 --> 11:11.589
we call it ‘gundgiri’ .

11:11.589 --> 11:13.930
So, this is the word we use.

11:13.930 --> 11:17.931
Now we haven’t got any word for a man like
that, to call him: you see, we do not call

11:17.931 --> 11:21.130
and enshrine people who are licentious here,
never!

11:21.130 --> 11:23.310
We never enshrine people who are permissive.

11:23.310 --> 11:29.390
But here, I don’t know how do you accept
it, that, “It’s a permissive society,

11:29.390 --> 11:30.390
so what?”

11:30.390 --> 11:31.760
“If it is a satanic society, so what?”

11:31.760 --> 11:33.980
But satanic means you are Satans!

11:33.980 --> 11:36.570
You have to say you are Satans.

11:36.570 --> 11:38.590
Even if you don’t like my language, what
other words can I use?

11:38.590 --> 11:39.590
You tell me.

11:39.590 --> 11:43.060
Is there any other word that can really describe
them?

11:43.060 --> 11:53.050
It is simply a very, very dilapidated state
of affairs and one has to accept it.

11:53.050 --> 11:54.269
It’s horrible!

11:54.269 --> 11:57.070
It’s rotting the whole society there.

11:57.070 --> 12:00.070
And we have to warn our people with very strong
words.

12:00.070 --> 12:04.130
Even if people think that these words are
very, very strong, you should not mind telling

12:04.130 --> 12:08.470
them that: “This is a very wrong thing that
you are doing in that country and one should

12:08.470 --> 12:10.480
never do it, and one should never accept."

12:10.480 --> 12:13.340
Because this may come here also and it’s
so shocking!

12:13.340 --> 12:20.100
Today she was telling me something, Felicity,
and Zareen was there and she just couldn’t

12:20.100 --> 12:21.100
understand anything.

12:21.100 --> 12:22.410
She was so shocked she was perspiring.

12:22.410 --> 12:24.950
Zareen, Zareen was there, and she was perspiring.

12:24.950 --> 12:27.770
And she couldn’t understand how could she
stand all this nonsense?

12:27.770 --> 12:30.230
No girl in India would stand this kind-of-a
nonsense.

12:30.230 --> 12:34.180
[If] any man tries to touch her she will just
slap him nicely and put him right!

12:34.180 --> 12:40.120
She knows what it means but you are so naïve
also about these things that you go on compromising

12:40.120 --> 12:45.750
on these fundamental things and on certain
things, like putting on weight, you get so

12:45.750 --> 12:46.750
upset.

12:46.750 --> 12:50.920
You should be upset about losing your chastity
much more than about losing your weight and

12:50.920 --> 12:52.880
things like that – it’s nothing important!

12:52.880 --> 12:57.089
The priorities are so funny that sometimes
I just can’t understand.

12:57.089 --> 13:01.959
The main thing is, your chastity is the most
important thing that must be saved and should

13:01.959 --> 13:04.779
not be allowed to be challenged by anyone
whatsoever!

13:04.779 --> 13:09.100
Women have given up [their] lives, they have
burnt themselves in this country, for saving

13:09.100 --> 13:10.100
their chastity.

13:10.100 --> 13:12.680
That’s the most important thing that they
want to save.

13:12.680 --> 13:17.970
While there it’s so sex-orientated that
you have got ideas, also, about your figures

13:17.970 --> 13:20.550
and things so that the body should be so attractive.

13:20.550 --> 13:24.709
It’s more like prostitution, I feel, myself,
the way you are all the time paying attention

13:24.709 --> 13:27.200
to your body that you should be attractive
to others.

13:27.200 --> 13:31.210
I mean this is something absurd and there
is no beauty in such things.

13:31.210 --> 13:34.680
It is nothing but perversion of life, absolute
perversion.

13:34.680 --> 13:39.360
You should try to remain in such a manner
that you are dignified.

13:39.360 --> 13:40.899
Even the ideas are so much changed now.

13:40.899 --> 13:46.339
I think it’s much more satanic than anything
else, because if you see Mona Lisa, who is

13:46.339 --> 13:51.570
regarded as still the best painting, she was
a plump lady and nobody has any objection.

13:51.570 --> 13:54.420
They pay such a lot of money just to see her
face!

13:54.420 --> 13:56.160
While suddenly the ideas have changed!

13:56.160 --> 14:00.770
I think a satanic force worked out to weaken
the women in this manner.

14:00.770 --> 14:05.850
Because a woman who practices these things
becomes very weak, physically, and then people

14:05.850 --> 14:09.250
can dominate them and can overtake them.

14:09.250 --> 14:16.980
And that’s why these funny ideas about [weight]
reducing women and men and make them absolutely

14:16.980 --> 14:23.810
slaves of these horrible satanic gurus and
things, have started, I think.

14:23.810 --> 14:25.040
This is how they do it.

14:25.040 --> 14:28.190
Perhaps it’s a very, very subtle way the
satanic [force] acts through putting these

14:28.190 --> 14:29.190
ideas.

14:29.190 --> 14:32.320
The other day only, a friend of mine had come
and she was telling me about her sister-in-law

14:32.320 --> 14:40.800
who went into a drastic [weight] reduction
process, suddenly.

14:40.800 --> 14:44.290
And I had met her about ten years back when
she started it and I told her, “What are

14:44.290 --> 14:45.290
you doing?

14:45.290 --> 14:46.290
You are looking so much older than your age.

14:46.290 --> 14:48.600
You are looking at least ten years older already."

14:48.600 --> 14:52.130
Now this lady told me, “Now she looks like
your mother!”

14:52.130 --> 14:53.130
I said, “Really?

14:53.130 --> 14:54.529
She’s so much younger to me in age."

14:54.529 --> 14:56.110
She said, “She looks so much like your mother."

14:56.110 --> 14:58.240
Because thin people look so much older.

14:58.240 --> 15:01.470
I have seen women of my age in England look
at least double my age.

15:01.470 --> 15:03.630
I mean, they look like my mothers there.

15:03.630 --> 15:08.610
Because of this kind of thing the whole body
shrivels up and also a little resistance that

15:08.610 --> 15:11.972
is needed, or reserve that is needed, is not
there, and a balance in the body is not there.

15:11.972 --> 15:18.680
And it’s a very wrong thing to treat your
body so shabbily just to satisfy certain foolish

15:18.680 --> 15:21.020
ideas that are all around.

15:21.020 --> 15:22.089
Be kind to your body.

15:22.089 --> 15:24.260
Don’t try to be very, very hard on this.

15:24.260 --> 15:25.829
It works on your heart.

15:25.829 --> 15:26.980
You might get a heart attack.

15:26.980 --> 15:30.720
You might get any kind of problems and it’s
a very wrong thing.

15:30.720 --> 15:34.380
Don’t develop yourself in the lines which
are suggested in the West.

15:34.380 --> 15:39.779
I have seen women who are so fidgety and so
irritatingly boring with their figures.

15:39.779 --> 15:42.010
I don’t know how people marry with them!

15:42.010 --> 15:43.081
That’s why you are having divorces also.

15:43.081 --> 15:45.850
You are having divorces.

15:45.850 --> 15:50.880
The women who always go to dieting are a very
irritating type.

15:50.880 --> 15:52.160
Actually, it’s a common thing.

15:52.160 --> 15:58.959
You know that Brutus has described by Shakespeare,
as a thin man who was so irritatingly funny

15:58.959 --> 16:00.180
that people never liked him.

16:00.180 --> 16:01.820
He was always a complaining type.

16:01.820 --> 16:06.209
So, one must understand, you must have a little
balance within yourself and don’t go all

16:06.209 --> 16:08.990
out for something that is so nonsensical.

16:08.990 --> 16:15.980
And always after Sahaj Yoga you will find
our will have a body which will have a weight

16:15.980 --> 16:20.120
because water is accumulated and you will
have a personality with that.

16:20.120 --> 16:24.791
Otherwise, I have seen some ladies who reduced
themselves too much, and when they went to

16:24.791 --> 16:29.820
England, one of them was the wife of a Cabinet
Secretary and she was taken as a secretary!

16:29.820 --> 16:33.150
And, she was made to sit somewhere in the
corner.

16:33.150 --> 16:35.200
And the gentleman came in and said, “Where’s
my wife?”

16:35.200 --> 16:36.740
They said, “Your wife never came."

16:36.740 --> 16:38.529
He said, “But my wife was here."

16:38.529 --> 16:40.580
So he said, “No, no, she’s never come."

16:40.580 --> 16:42.880
He said, “But she was to arrive here earlier."

16:42.880 --> 16:46.279
Then they said, “No, there’s only one
Indian lady who has come.

16:46.279 --> 16:47.740
She’s sitting in the corner there."

16:47.740 --> 16:49.690
And they said, “We thought she was your
secretary."

16:49.690 --> 16:53.220
You see, a certain amount of dignity is needed.

16:53.220 --> 16:59.030
And also, in India, also all of our Gods and
Goddesses have been like that, because it

16:59.030 --> 17:03.720
gives you dignity, a contour and a personality
which is required.

17:03.720 --> 17:07.530
Of course it should not be a hindrance to
you in anyway and should not be too much.

17:07.530 --> 17:12.220
But the amount of fighting and quarrelling
[that] is going on among thin people is so

17:12.220 --> 17:14.360
saddening that one wants to run away.

17:14.360 --> 17:19.229
On the contrary, a person who laughs and is
relaxed always puts on weight.

17:19.229 --> 17:22.970
And what’s the use of making a mess out
of yourself that nobody can even stand you?

17:22.970 --> 17:24.089
You’ll become like a thorn!

17:24.089 --> 17:27.970
So, I would warn you that don’t go in for
these drastic things of [weight] reductions

17:27.970 --> 17:28.970
and all that.

17:28.970 --> 17:29.970
That’s not Sahaj.

17:29.970 --> 17:32.580
Of course, you should not put on weight much,
then it’s different.

17:32.580 --> 17:34.669
But don’t go in for drastic things.

17:34.669 --> 17:36.350
That is asahaja.

17:36.350 --> 17:41.440
And don’t become like bamboos, because these
bamboos have no impression on people and people

17:41.440 --> 17:53.559
must see you flowering like beautiful lotuses
and they should be blooming with health.

17:53.559 --> 17:57.190
Because you know the Goddess is described
as Pushti is well-nourished.

17:57.190 --> 18:00.429
A person should look well nourished.

18:00.429 --> 18:06.600
In London, when you walk, sometimes I feel
that half of these women who have no weight

18:06.600 --> 18:11.090
might be lifted away by the breeze that is
coming and may be planted into something horrible!

18:11.090 --> 18:12.580
It might be happening to some women.

18:12.580 --> 18:15.350
And they are a very irritated type.

18:15.350 --> 18:17.559
Extremely irritable temperaments they have.

18:17.559 --> 18:20.840
And they are all the time complaining, complaining,
complaining.

18:20.840 --> 18:25.080
We have some neighbours and I happened to
go to one of their meetings.

18:25.080 --> 18:27.130
And I got so bored with them [that] I came
away.

18:27.130 --> 18:31.049
And they didn’t know how to talk to each
other so they asked for drinks and started

18:31.049 --> 18:34.960
drinking, because there was no other way out
from this kind of an irritated nature, the

18:34.960 --> 18:36.179
way they were complaining to each other.

18:36.179 --> 18:39.229
They got so tired of each other that they
said, “Let’s have some drinks."

18:39.229 --> 18:41.059
That’s the only way they can exist then.

18:41.059 --> 18:46.419
So try to be very, very humorous and jolly
and happy people.

18:46.419 --> 18:47.619
Enjoy yourself.

18:47.619 --> 18:49.509
That’s the thing God has given you.

18:49.509 --> 18:52.070
And not try to become like Bombil machis!

18:52.070 --> 18:55.519
You see, that is one thing I must tell you
[which] is very important.

18:55.519 --> 18:59.990
Because that is something that will be very
wrong and will be asahaja.

18:59.990 --> 19:03.539
Of course you should not be extremely fat
that you can’t move out.

19:03.539 --> 19:04.539
You need not be.

19:04.539 --> 19:08.679
You will never be with Sahaj Yoga, because
if you get more fat it will be dissolved and

19:08.679 --> 19:10.820
things will be this thing.

19:10.820 --> 19:11.820
Now, what is the criteria?

19:11.820 --> 19:12.820
What are we to know?

19:12.820 --> 19:13.980
What sort of a weight is needed?

19:13.980 --> 19:14.980
There’s no criteria.

19:14.980 --> 19:16.549
We have to have different weights.

19:16.549 --> 19:18.101
We have to have different heights.

19:18.101 --> 19:19.101
We have to have different clothes.

19:19.101 --> 19:21.200
We have to be very, very different.

19:21.200 --> 19:22.559
And variety brings the beauty.

19:22.559 --> 19:27.379
If you have all of them put together in the
same way, the same forms, with the same dresses

19:27.379 --> 19:29.890
going round, you get so bored looking at them!

19:29.890 --> 19:32.960
As if a machine has created all these people,
human beings.

19:32.960 --> 19:34.629
There’s no sweetness about it.

19:34.629 --> 19:37.620
So, don’t try to play havoc with the nature.

19:37.620 --> 19:38.620
Never try that.

19:38.620 --> 19:42.429
Try to be attuned to the nature, attuned to
it.

19:42.429 --> 19:48.539
Because all such things create problems and
the first problem that is created is the liver.

19:48.539 --> 19:53.609
So, be careful and don’t go into such haphazard
treatments.

19:53.609 --> 20:00.039
I would again request you, all of you, never
to go in for such drastic things, neither

20:00.039 --> 20:03.279
in medicines nor in exercising yourself.

20:03.279 --> 20:07.840
Because you know, with exercises, what happens
to your heart, we have seen it now.

20:07.840 --> 20:11.849
And it’s very difficult to rectify it, so
be careful about it.

20:11.849 --> 20:14.999
And automatically you come down, you are normalised.

20:14.999 --> 20:17.600
And God knows how much weight you should have
and all that.

20:17.600 --> 20:20.590
Now, those people who eat more may not put
on weight.

20:20.590 --> 20:22.630
Those who eat less may put on weight.

20:22.630 --> 20:23.630
It’s possible.

20:23.630 --> 20:24.630
This happens.

20:24.630 --> 20:27.099
So it depends on your temperament, whatever
are the requirements.

20:27.099 --> 20:28.849
And of course, you must keep a watch.

20:28.849 --> 20:33.980
But still I would say that one should not
try to do something of that kind.

20:33.980 --> 20:37.240
On the contrary if somebody eats too much,
that means something is wrong.

20:37.240 --> 20:39.539
If he eats too little also there’s something
wrong.

20:39.539 --> 20:46.330
So you should eat a normal type of food and
lead a normal life.

20:46.330 --> 20:49.529
And one type of food also one should not eat
– too much of one type of food.

20:49.529 --> 20:53.779
We should eat all kinds of food and try to
understand your own nature, what sort of a

20:53.779 --> 20:54.899
nature you have.

20:54.899 --> 20:58.599
And tomorrow I am going to give you a little
bit of Ayurveda, by which you will know what

20:58.599 --> 21:03.630
is your nature and what sort of food you have
to have and how you have to be a normal person.

21:03.630 --> 21:05.179
May God Bless you, now.

21:05.179 --> 21:06.120
So let’s have food.
