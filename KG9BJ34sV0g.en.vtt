00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.330
You develop a hypertension, you become very
agitated, you start dancing and doing all

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:06.440
kinds of things.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.410
These things can happen – that you may start
dancing, jumping, shouting, doing all kinds

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.599
of things, getting into licentiousness, permissiveness.

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:16.540
Because that’s how you are let loose.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:22.220
The control on your being of the wisdom is
lost, and then you just get into it.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:28.030
And you don’t feel the pinch of your conscience.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.850
The pinch of the conscience is no more.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.180
You just go arbitrary and you just shoot off.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.280
It can happen to people even without feeling
this.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.309
Even without feeling this some people can
get into that kind of a mood.

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:51.379
That’s how they become alcoholic and they
become all these things where they have no

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:52.379
control.

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.379
(break in recording)

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:58.370
…eventually he was absolutely on [his] deathbed
because he got cirrhosis of the liver and

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.469
he was going to die.

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:06.272
He had left Sahaj Yoga, he wanted to do it
on his own and all that, and he just lost

00:01:06.272 --> 00:01:07.272
it, poor thing!

00:01:07.272 --> 00:01:08.280
Within three months he started showing results.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.980
And he was so badly off and I brought him
home.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.983
My husband had gone abroad and when he came
back he said, “What’s this?

00:01:12.983 --> 00:01:15.380
You have got a dead person in the house!

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.850
They are going to prosecute us, we are all
going to be in jail.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.800
He’s going to die next moment the way he
is.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.030
I just can’t look at him!”

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.030
He was very angry.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.500
I said, “Now where can I send him?

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.010
After all, he’s so sick, it would be very
inhuman to send him anywhere out."

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.080
He said, “All right, tomorrow you arrange
something and send him away."

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.050
But next day you see when my husband got up
from his bed he saw this gentleman walking

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.050
about.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.050
He was so surprised and aghast!

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.690
He came in and he said, “The fellow is out,
out of his bed!

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.110
I just can’t believe my eyes."

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.120
And then within seven days he was completely
cured.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.050
But then Gus told me that, “Mother, some
of us are so egotistical that we have to go

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.750
to that limit to know you and to come to you.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.510
It’s not possible for some people to give
up their ego and to behave in this manner,

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.770
so you better allow them to go to that position
and then to come back."

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.010
I said, “For a Mother it is difficult.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.619
She will try to tell them again and again
that, no, no, you try to get all right."

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:10.830
So, that’s what he told me.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.850
But this is very true.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.890
You see, what I have found with the Western
people is that they are really egotistical

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.980
in the sense that they, they don’t mind
killing themselves.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.340
The ego is so self-destroying that they know
that they are unkind to themselves but to

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.040
just satisfy their ego, they’ll go on destroying
themselves.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.880
And they reach such a funny point that you
just can’t understand how they have been

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.370
so foolish about it.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.360
Then he started respecting himself and then
he went to his mother.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.160
He said, “I feel tremendous love for my
mother!”

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.810
Whom he had left for years.

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.060
He never bothered about her.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.060
Then he went down [to Australia].

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.500
Now he’s in Australia looking after his
mother and he’ll be coming back to London.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.530
I am sure he’s much better off.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.160
He writes very sweet letters.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.990
So this is what is the thing of Mr.

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:59.599
Gus, who was the leader of all the hippies
of London and who was a very clever boy, and

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:02.020
he was a Physics professor.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.209
And so you can imagine what can happen to
an egotistical person, how he can lose his

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:07.440
complete wisdom.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:16.880
In Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan there were about
300 people out of which at least 275 people

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.640
were Indians.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.870
And they were all suffering from some disease
or other.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.599
I got such a fright and I was so angry with
all of them.

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:27.800
I said, “None of you are healthy to come
to me."

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:34.250
Some were suffering from paralysis, some were
suffering from gout and all kinds of troubles

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.250
they had.

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.170
And, in that lot I found Cooly sitting in
front of me and he was absolutely cool, very,

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:47.000
very cool: so much that he was like a frozen
dough.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.530
And I felt him and I said, “Now this is
too much!”

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.849
But because of his heart catching you see.

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:00.920
When your heart is caught up you can feel
that kind of coolness because it depresses

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.120
your heart more and you get that cool there.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.020
So I called him Cooly.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.020
And [Dr.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:11.890
Denton] Cooley is one doctor whom you might
have heard about him, who is in Houston, where

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.440
they are operating small children, and I had
taken my grandchild there.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.700
So I met him: He looked very much like our
Cooly, but he’s a very tall fellow; a very

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.370
kindly person.

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.350
And when I saw him I combined these two things
together because he’s was so cool and also

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.910
his face so much like Dr.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.630
Cooley that I called him Cooly; and that’s
how [he got the name].

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:37.990
And then whenever he talked to me he said,
“You remember Mother, I’m Cooly speaking."

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.430
So his name became Cooly forever (laughter).

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.340
Now, come along.

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.510
His name is Anthony Panayiotou.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:52.720
He is from Cyprus, very near Greece from where
Alexander the Great came to us.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.270
And now comes ‘Cooly the Great’.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.780
But I must also give the other side of the
picture.

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.020
The other side of the picture is that though
you people have one problem which I call as

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.930
the sin against the Mother, also Indians have
sin against the Father, which they do not

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.330
know.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.940
In London you cannot imagine someone running
away with your chappals (Indian sandals) from

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:17.940
Caxton Hall.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.720
Nobody can even think of such nonsense!

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.260
But here, how many of you have lost your chappals
in the programme?

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.010
And not only you but even yesterday, poor
Mr.

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:31.070
Pradhan lost his new shoe because where he
wore it for a function like that!

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:36.360
This kind of an absurdity is only possible
in this wretched India, where you get all

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.360
this kind of nonsense!

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:45.590
That’s the point where I really cannot understand
that people are so much worried and upset

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:50.290
about their belongings, about their things
and they want to grab anything that comes

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:52.060
in their way.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.320
If they can do it without paying anything
for it, they’ll be very happy.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.400
So, in this way we are really committing sins
against the Father, who has said that He is

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.560
going to look after the kshema (well-being)
also.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.160
He looks after the kshema.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.810
And while we do not believe into it that He
looks after it.

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.780
We get upset for a little money spent here.

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:10.190
We get upset for little things done there.

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.560
I mean we are really, that way, very, very
funny people.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:20.479
Though Indians are very generous no doubt
but they do not mind taking away things without

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:23.700
the knowledge of the person who is around.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.389
It’s something so funny!

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:28.261
Of course, everybody does not do it but quite
a lot of [them do].

00:06:28.261 --> 00:06:32.139
But especially the people who are at the helm
of affairs are absolute cheats sometimes and

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:35.380
are so funny that one can’t understand why
do they want to cheat?

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.430
I mean, they have everything, and they have
got a lot of money.

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:42.031
But they won’t mind taking away some money
away from you, taking away some money away

00:06:42.031 --> 00:06:43.190
from the other person.

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:47.500
For no rhyme and reason they will expect you
to give them money and bribes and things like

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:48.500
that.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.410
So, this is something so surprising that in
London we have taken a flat, and now you know

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:53.410
we have taken a house.

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:56.740
We have taken a flat from one Indian and then
we took a house in London.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:01.200
I didn’t have to pay any black money or
anything like that for taking this house and

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.270
it worked out very well.

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:08.050
But here it is not possible unless and until
you give them some black money and you do

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:09.150
all kinds of nonsensical things.

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.070
It’s very, very difficult!

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:13.610
Even in England Indians try this trick with
others.

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:19.570
If you remember our first flat fellow wanted
us to give him some money and wanted this

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:21.479
and that, and I had a big argument with him.

00:07:21.479 --> 00:07:25.759
So, this kind of a nonsense which I call as
the sin against the Father is all the time

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:26.759
[there].

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:31.730
Even if they get a broken chappal somewhere,
they would carry it out.

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:37.490
I mean, all this kind of a thing is not possible
in London: people are very, very honest and

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:41.570
they don’t take somebody’s money like
that nor do they take away things.

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:45.980
Here if you have the kind of newspaper distribution
you have there, people will take away the

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:47.400
newspaper!

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:57.600
They will take away even the container of
the money and also the cash box and also the

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:01.370
lamppost!

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:03.590
And they can use it for any purpose.

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:06.520
Even I have seen people putting their bottles
out.

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:13.199
And everything, the way we have in London,
the postal system, they send anything to you

00:08:13.199 --> 00:08:17.240
from thousands of rupees to any amount; nobody
takes it.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.650
It is kept outside your house.

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:19.990
It is lying there.

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:21.259
Nobody takes it!

00:08:21.259 --> 00:08:28.470
Especially in Oxted, a place of, so forlorn
and absolutely a desolate place and there

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:32.919
also I have seen [that] if something arrived
by parcel, it would be lying there for two

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:35.882
days, three days, if you were out and nobody
would touch it.

00:08:35.882 --> 00:08:38.060
That is not possible here at all.

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:41.919
People would even take away locks you have,
they’ll take away the panels you have (Mother

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:42.919
laughs).

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:45.580
I mean, they can take away anything they feel
like.

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:55.140
Can you imagine in India people can even take
away a small, little tap that is hanging out!

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:57.860
From the bathrooms they’ll take away the
taps.

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:03.400
You allow them to go wash in your washbasin,
they may take away the washbasins!

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.310
Dustbins: they’ll take away your dustbins.

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:07.210
They can take away anything!

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:11.750
Like they are possessed by some people who
are thieves and thugs or I don’t know what!

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:16.750
Our gurus are just the same: they don’t
mind living on opium that is other people’s

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:17.750
money.

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:19.340
They indulge in other people’s money all
the time.

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:20.890
They have no shame about it.

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:25.140
And when I say anything about it people say,
“Mother, you are very hard on them!”

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:26.140
What should I say?

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:30.500
Should I garland them and make an aarti out
of them that: what thugs you are, very nicely

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.320
living on the people’s money?

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.900
I just can’t understand what one should
say.

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:39.330
I feel so ashamed of them, and responsible
also, the way they have really lynched all

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:40.360
the Western seekers.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:44.500
And these are sadhus and they have no business
to do that!

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:48.990
And with that they have put all the bhoots
into them and have taken all that they had.

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:53.200
Even there are some people, one boy came to
me, he didn’t have a proper shoe on him,

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.260
and he’s the son of a Lord!

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:59.040
And he said, “Now my father has no place
for me because I stole some antiques from

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:03.510
his house and sold them to give it to this
fellow who’s now having an airstrip for

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:04.510
himself."

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:06.790
Is this the way?

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:09.720
To lynch people and take money from them and
befool them?

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:12.720
I mean, this is really shameful, absolutely
shameful.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.240
And I am really ashamed of it.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:21.120
So, though we are, in a way, naïve, because
we are not yet exposed to that kind of a sex-orientated

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:26.290
society: but it will take no time if we do
not stop it now with a complete force.

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:31.399
It will take no time for us to get into that
horrible, perverted thing, you see.

00:10:31.399 --> 00:10:34.540
And the other day somebody asked me, “What
do you say to permissiveness and to licentiousness?”

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:39.870
So, I said, “In our Indian language, we
call it badmashi and badchalni."

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:42.100
This is the word we have got.

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:45.050
I mean we have no other sensible words for
these things.

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:47.000
They are called badchalni and badmashi.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.630
This is the word we have got.

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:49.680
What am I to do?

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:53.800
I mean, can you suggest some new words for
permissiveness and licentiousness?

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.600
These are all horrid things!

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.910
And I mean, this is regarded as something
very bad.

00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:04.790
So, this one can be twisted also, and people
can say that Mataji calls all the Westerners

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:05.790
badmash.

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:10.280
But if you are licentious, according to Indian
language, any language, in Marathi language,

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:11.589
we call it ‘gundgiri’ .

00:11:11.589 --> 00:11:13.930
So, this is the word we use.

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:17.931
Now we haven’t got any word for a man like
that, to call him: you see, we do not call

00:11:17.931 --> 00:11:21.130
and enshrine people who are licentious here,
never!

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:23.310
We never enshrine people who are permissive.

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:29.390
But here, I don’t know how do you accept
it, that, “It’s a permissive society,

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:30.390
so what?”

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:31.760
“If it is a satanic society, so what?”

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.980
But satanic means you are Satans!

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:36.570
You have to say you are Satans.

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:38.590
Even if you don’t like my language, what
other words can I use?

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:39.590
You tell me.

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:43.060
Is there any other word that can really describe
them?

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:53.050
It is simply a very, very dilapidated state
of affairs and one has to accept it.

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:54.269
It’s horrible!

00:11:54.269 --> 00:11:57.070
It’s rotting the whole society there.

00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:00.070
And we have to warn our people with very strong
words.

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:04.130
Even if people think that these words are
very, very strong, you should not mind telling

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:08.470
them that: “This is a very wrong thing that
you are doing in that country and one should

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:10.480
never do it, and one should never accept."

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.340
Because this may come here also and it’s
so shocking!

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:20.100
Today she was telling me something, Felicity,
and Zareen was there and she just couldn’t

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:21.100
understand anything.

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:22.410
She was so shocked she was perspiring.

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:24.950
Zareen, Zareen was there, and she was perspiring.

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:27.770
And she couldn’t understand how could she
stand all this nonsense?

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:30.230
No girl in India would stand this kind-of-a
nonsense.

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:34.180
[If] any man tries to touch her she will just
slap him nicely and put him right!

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:40.120
She knows what it means but you are so naïve
also about these things that you go on compromising

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:45.750
on these fundamental things and on certain
things, like putting on weight, you get so

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:46.750
upset.

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:50.920
You should be upset about losing your chastity
much more than about losing your weight and

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:52.880
things like that – it’s nothing important!

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:57.089
The priorities are so funny that sometimes
I just can’t understand.

00:12:57.089 --> 00:13:01.959
The main thing is, your chastity is the most
important thing that must be saved and should

00:13:01.959 --> 00:13:04.779
not be allowed to be challenged by anyone
whatsoever!

00:13:04.779 --> 00:13:09.100
Women have given up [their] lives, they have
burnt themselves in this country, for saving

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.100
their chastity.

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:12.680
That’s the most important thing that they
want to save.

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:17.970
While there it’s so sex-orientated that
you have got ideas, also, about your figures

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:20.550
and things so that the body should be so attractive.

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:24.709
It’s more like prostitution, I feel, myself,
the way you are all the time paying attention

00:13:24.709 --> 00:13:27.200
to your body that you should be attractive
to others.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:31.210
I mean this is something absurd and there
is no beauty in such things.

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:34.680
It is nothing but perversion of life, absolute
perversion.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:39.360
You should try to remain in such a manner
that you are dignified.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.899
Even the ideas are so much changed now.

00:13:40.899 --> 00:13:46.339
I think it’s much more satanic than anything
else, because if you see Mona Lisa, who is

00:13:46.339 --> 00:13:51.570
regarded as still the best painting, she was
a plump lady and nobody has any objection.

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:54.420
They pay such a lot of money just to see her
face!

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:56.160
While suddenly the ideas have changed!

00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:00.770
I think a satanic force worked out to weaken
the women in this manner.

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:05.850
Because a woman who practices these things
becomes very weak, physically, and then people

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:09.250
can dominate them and can overtake them.

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:16.980
And that’s why these funny ideas about [weight]
reducing women and men and make them absolutely

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:23.810
slaves of these horrible satanic gurus and
things, have started, I think.

00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:25.040
This is how they do it.

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:28.190
Perhaps it’s a very, very subtle way the
satanic [force] acts through putting these

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:29.190
ideas.

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:32.320
The other day only, a friend of mine had come
and she was telling me about her sister-in-law

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:40.800
who went into a drastic [weight] reduction
process, suddenly.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:44.290
And I had met her about ten years back when
she started it and I told her, “What are

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:45.290
you doing?

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:46.290
You are looking so much older than your age.

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:48.600
You are looking at least ten years older already."

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:52.130
Now this lady told me, “Now she looks like
your mother!”

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:53.130
I said, “Really?

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:54.529
She’s so much younger to me in age."

00:14:54.529 --> 00:14:56.110
She said, “She looks so much like your mother."

00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:58.240
Because thin people look so much older.

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:01.470
I have seen women of my age in England look
at least double my age.

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:03.630
I mean, they look like my mothers there.

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:08.610
Because of this kind of thing the whole body
shrivels up and also a little resistance that

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:11.972
is needed, or reserve that is needed, is not
there, and a balance in the body is not there.

00:15:11.972 --> 00:15:18.680
And it’s a very wrong thing to treat your
body so shabbily just to satisfy certain foolish

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.020
ideas that are all around.

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:22.089
Be kind to your body.

00:15:22.089 --> 00:15:24.260
Don’t try to be very, very hard on this.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:25.829
It works on your heart.

00:15:25.829 --> 00:15:26.980
You might get a heart attack.

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:30.720
You might get any kind of problems and it’s
a very wrong thing.

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:34.380
Don’t develop yourself in the lines which
are suggested in the West.

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:39.779
I have seen women who are so fidgety and so
irritatingly boring with their figures.

00:15:39.779 --> 00:15:42.010
I don’t know how people marry with them!

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:43.081
That’s why you are having divorces also.

00:15:43.081 --> 00:15:45.850
You are having divorces.

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:50.880
The women who always go to dieting are a very
irritating type.

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.160
Actually, it’s a common thing.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:58.959
You know that Brutus has described by Shakespeare,
as a thin man who was so irritatingly funny

00:15:58.959 --> 00:16:00.180
that people never liked him.

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:01.820
He was always a complaining type.

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:06.209
So, one must understand, you must have a little
balance within yourself and don’t go all

00:16:06.209 --> 00:16:08.990
out for something that is so nonsensical.

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:15.980
And always after Sahaj Yoga you will find
our will have a body which will have a weight

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:20.120
because water is accumulated and you will
have a personality with that.

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:24.791
Otherwise, I have seen some ladies who reduced
themselves too much, and when they went to

00:16:24.791 --> 00:16:29.820
England, one of them was the wife of a Cabinet
Secretary and she was taken as a secretary!

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:33.150
And, she was made to sit somewhere in the
corner.

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:35.200
And the gentleman came in and said, “Where’s
my wife?”

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.740
They said, “Your wife never came."

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:38.529
He said, “But my wife was here."

00:16:38.529 --> 00:16:40.580
So he said, “No, no, she’s never come."

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:42.880
He said, “But she was to arrive here earlier."

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:46.279
Then they said, “No, there’s only one
Indian lady who has come.

00:16:46.279 --> 00:16:47.740
She’s sitting in the corner there."

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:49.690
And they said, “We thought she was your
secretary."

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:53.220
You see, a certain amount of dignity is needed.

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:59.030
And also, in India, also all of our Gods and
Goddesses have been like that, because it

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:03.720
gives you dignity, a contour and a personality
which is required.

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:07.530
Of course it should not be a hindrance to
you in anyway and should not be too much.

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:12.220
But the amount of fighting and quarrelling
[that] is going on among thin people is so

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:14.360
saddening that one wants to run away.

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:19.229
On the contrary, a person who laughs and is
relaxed always puts on weight.

00:17:19.229 --> 00:17:22.970
And what’s the use of making a mess out
of yourself that nobody can even stand you?

00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:24.089
You’ll become like a thorn!

00:17:24.089 --> 00:17:27.970
So, I would warn you that don’t go in for
these drastic things of [weight] reductions

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:28.970
and all that.

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:29.970
That’s not Sahaj.

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:32.580
Of course, you should not put on weight much,
then it’s different.

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:34.669
But don’t go in for drastic things.

00:17:34.669 --> 00:17:36.350
That is asahaja.

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:41.440
And don’t become like bamboos, because these
bamboos have no impression on people and people

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:53.559
must see you flowering like beautiful lotuses
and they should be blooming with health.

00:17:53.559 --> 00:17:57.190
Because you know the Goddess is described
as Pushti is well-nourished.

00:17:57.190 --> 00:18:00.429
A person should look well nourished.

00:18:00.429 --> 00:18:06.600
In London, when you walk, sometimes I feel
that half of these women who have no weight

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:11.090
might be lifted away by the breeze that is
coming and may be planted into something horrible!

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:12.580
It might be happening to some women.

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:15.350
And they are a very irritated type.

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:17.559
Extremely irritable temperaments they have.

00:18:17.559 --> 00:18:20.840
And they are all the time complaining, complaining,
complaining.

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:25.080
We have some neighbours and I happened to
go to one of their meetings.

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:27.130
And I got so bored with them [that] I came
away.

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:31.049
And they didn’t know how to talk to each
other so they asked for drinks and started

00:18:31.049 --> 00:18:34.960
drinking, because there was no other way out
from this kind of an irritated nature, the

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.179
way they were complaining to each other.

00:18:36.179 --> 00:18:39.229
They got so tired of each other that they
said, “Let’s have some drinks."

00:18:39.229 --> 00:18:41.059
That’s the only way they can exist then.

00:18:41.059 --> 00:18:46.419
So try to be very, very humorous and jolly
and happy people.

00:18:46.419 --> 00:18:47.619
Enjoy yourself.

00:18:47.619 --> 00:18:49.509
That’s the thing God has given you.

00:18:49.509 --> 00:18:52.070
And not try to become like Bombil machis!

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:55.519
You see, that is one thing I must tell you
[which] is very important.

00:18:55.519 --> 00:18:59.990
Because that is something that will be very
wrong and will be asahaja.

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:03.539
Of course you should not be extremely fat
that you can’t move out.

00:19:03.539 --> 00:19:04.539
You need not be.

00:19:04.539 --> 00:19:08.679
You will never be with Sahaj Yoga, because
if you get more fat it will be dissolved and

00:19:08.679 --> 00:19:10.820
things will be this thing.

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:11.820
Now, what is the criteria?

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:12.820
What are we to know?

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:13.980
What sort of a weight is needed?

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:14.980
There’s no criteria.

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:16.549
We have to have different weights.

00:19:16.549 --> 00:19:18.101
We have to have different heights.

00:19:18.101 --> 00:19:19.101
We have to have different clothes.

00:19:19.101 --> 00:19:21.200
We have to be very, very different.

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.559
And variety brings the beauty.

00:19:22.559 --> 00:19:27.379
If you have all of them put together in the
same way, the same forms, with the same dresses

00:19:27.379 --> 00:19:29.890
going round, you get so bored looking at them!

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:32.960
As if a machine has created all these people,
human beings.

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:34.629
There’s no sweetness about it.

00:19:34.629 --> 00:19:37.620
So, don’t try to play havoc with the nature.

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:38.620
Never try that.

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:42.429
Try to be attuned to the nature, attuned to
it.

00:19:42.429 --> 00:19:48.539
Because all such things create problems and
the first problem that is created is the liver.

00:19:48.539 --> 00:19:53.609
So, be careful and don’t go into such haphazard
treatments.

00:19:53.609 --> 00:20:00.039
I would again request you, all of you, never
to go in for such drastic things, neither

00:20:00.039 --> 00:20:03.279
in medicines nor in exercising yourself.

00:20:03.279 --> 00:20:07.840
Because you know, with exercises, what happens
to your heart, we have seen it now.

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:11.849
And it’s very difficult to rectify it, so
be careful about it.

00:20:11.849 --> 00:20:14.999
And automatically you come down, you are normalised.

00:20:14.999 --> 00:20:17.600
And God knows how much weight you should have
and all that.

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.590
Now, those people who eat more may not put
on weight.

00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:22.630
Those who eat less may put on weight.

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:23.630
It’s possible.

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:24.630
This happens.

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:27.099
So it depends on your temperament, whatever
are the requirements.

00:20:27.099 --> 00:20:28.849
And of course, you must keep a watch.

00:20:28.849 --> 00:20:33.980
But still I would say that one should not
try to do something of that kind.

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:37.240
On the contrary if somebody eats too much,
that means something is wrong.

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:39.539
If he eats too little also there’s something
wrong.

00:20:39.539 --> 00:20:46.330
So you should eat a normal type of food and
lead a normal life.

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:49.529
And one type of food also one should not eat
– too much of one type of food.

00:20:49.529 --> 00:20:53.779
We should eat all kinds of food and try to
understand your own nature, what sort of a

00:20:53.779 --> 00:20:54.899
nature you have.

00:20:54.899 --> 00:20:58.599
And tomorrow I am going to give you a little
bit of Ayurveda, by which you will know what

00:20:58.599 --> 00:21:03.630
is your nature and what sort of food you have
to have and how you have to be a normal person.

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:05.179
May God Bless you, now.

00:21:05.179 --> 00:21:06.120
So let’s have food.
