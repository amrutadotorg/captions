00:00:08.963 --> 00:00:13.546
So I'll try to tell you about the Lakshmi,

00:00:13.662 --> 00:00:15.734
the symbol of Lakshmi.

00:00:15.814 --> 00:00:21.250
Shri Lakshmi is the symbol of the completeness of womanhood.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.169
She brings wealth, prosperity, auspiciousness.

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:30.105
She brings in understanding,

00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:35.770
generosity, peace and joy.

00:00:35.851 --> 00:00:39.058
She is the giver of all the blessings.

00:00:39.138 --> 00:00:43.513
The symbol of Lakshmi is that She stands on the lotus

00:00:43.614 --> 00:00:45.200
which is pink in color.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:53.107
Pink color is the warmth of a motherhood.

00:00:53.187 --> 00:00:58.752
In India even a small girl is called as "mother".

00:00:58.832 --> 00:01:03.874
So, in the various aspects of Lakshmi, the symbol is that

00:01:03.955 --> 00:01:09.127
first She is a very warm person;

00:01:09.208 --> 00:01:12.387
also in one hand She has the lotus

00:01:12.774 --> 00:01:16.360
which is also pink in color,

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.517
that also suggestive of Her warmth.

00:01:21.598 --> 00:01:26.815
Even a funny type of a moth with all kinds of thorns

00:01:26.895 --> 00:01:29.066
attached to his body

00:01:29.146 --> 00:01:34.080
enters into a lotus, he finds a place
where he can rest.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.225
She makes all the guests to come in her house and

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.880
have the best bed and the best food.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:50.028
Normally the men bring in a guest and the wife

00:01:50.108 --> 00:01:54.736
receives him and looks after him.

00:01:54.816 --> 00:02:01.024
So, it is suggestive that we have to look after

00:02:01.105 --> 00:02:04.015
any type of a guest who comes to our house,

00:02:04.095 --> 00:02:07.074
and should completely

00:02:07.154 --> 00:02:11.987
devote ourselves to the looking after of the guest

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:13.999
who is from outside.

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:20.945
She is standing on the lotus and wearing also a pink sari.

00:02:21.025 --> 00:02:23.858
That is, you have to have balance

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:26.938
to stand on a thing like lotus

00:02:27.018 --> 00:02:30.154
because She's surrounded by water,

00:02:30.234 --> 00:02:35.004
and there are many animals around it;

00:02:35.085 --> 00:02:39.771
beast-like people who try to entice Her,

00:02:39.851 --> 00:02:45.509
so She has to have a complete balance.

00:02:45.822 --> 00:02:52.322
Also She has two hands with the lotus

00:02:52.403 --> 00:02:58.188
and with two other hands She is giving,

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.236
and with another hand She's blessing.

00:03:02.316 --> 00:03:05.858
This one means that she should be generous,

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:10.178
she should be giving always to others, not for herself.

00:03:10.258 --> 00:03:12.720
She should not spend all the money on herself

00:03:12.801 --> 00:03:16.725
and nothing for the children or for the guests or for others.

00:03:16.806 --> 00:03:20.140
So it is the Lakshmi who has to give,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.413
who has to be generous.

00:03:22.493 --> 00:03:26.759
I have seen those people in Sahaja Yoga are generous,

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.138
their wives may not be, and then they suffer a lot.

00:03:31.218 --> 00:03:34.865
But if the wife is generous, she's rewarded,

00:03:34.946 --> 00:03:37.365
the whole family is rewarded hundred times.

00:03:37.445 --> 00:03:41.361
Generosity is like this, that you have one door open

00:03:41.442 --> 00:03:44.381
through which everything is coming in,

00:03:44.534 --> 00:03:47.903
and you open another door by giving,

00:03:47.984 --> 00:03:49.870
so there's a very good circulation.

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:57.003
I enjoy My generosity the most, if it is generosity,

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:01.626
and generosity is so rewarding,

00:04:01.745 --> 00:04:06.286
so rewarding that it is unbelievable

00:04:06.367 --> 00:04:12.255
how the divine forces help a person who is generous.

00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:16.545
I'll give an example.
I had a friend

00:04:16.626 --> 00:04:19.751
who said she wanted a sari from the foreign countries,

00:04:19.832 --> 00:04:21.885
these imported saris;

00:04:21.965 --> 00:04:27.714
and I had two of them and I told a another lady

00:04:27.795 --> 00:04:29.550
who was very miserly that

00:04:29.631 --> 00:04:32.313
I would like to give away these two saris to her.

00:04:32.393 --> 00:04:35.727
So she said, "You have only these two left now,

00:04:35.808 --> 00:04:37.619
why do You want to give her this sari?"

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.415
She was miserly type.

00:04:39.495 --> 00:04:42.235
We were talking in the kitchen,

00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:46.610
but somebody rang the bell and I opened the door.

00:04:46.691 --> 00:04:51.920
He had brought two saris from Africa,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.648
because some lady who had gone to Africa had sent them.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.162
So I said, "Why did she send Me saris?"

00:05:02.242 --> 00:05:08.423
He said, "Because You had given her saris when
she went, so she has sent You these."

00:05:08.503 --> 00:05:11.753
And when I opened the saris they were exactly the same,

00:05:11.834 --> 00:05:13.783
the ones I had with Me.

00:05:13.863 --> 00:05:16.863
So I took out both the saris and showed her,

00:05:16.944 --> 00:05:19.933
"See, this is the example."

00:05:20.013 --> 00:05:22.224
This is how it is, always.

00:05:22.305 --> 00:05:26.973
Everything comes back to you when you are kind

00:05:27.053 --> 00:05:30.096
to others, or if you are generous to others.

00:05:30.176 --> 00:05:35.532
You will find later on yourself, and so many have already
found,

00:05:35.612 --> 00:05:38.938
They can't understand from where the money is coming.

00:05:39.018 --> 00:05:43.212
Just it works out that you get money,

00:05:43.292 --> 00:05:44.841
whenever you want.

00:05:44.921 --> 00:05:49.151
Just forget it and it comes to you.

00:05:49.232 --> 00:05:52.564
People who are meticulously counting their money

00:05:52.645 --> 00:05:54.674
all the time, every morning,

00:05:54.754 --> 00:05:57.532
are never satisfied and also

00:05:57.613 --> 00:06:00.969
they haven't got the blessings of any kind.

00:06:01.049 --> 00:06:06.814
But if you'll just keep the worry of money to God,

00:06:06.894 --> 00:06:08.934
everything works out.

00:06:09.014 --> 00:06:11.600
So what do we understand?

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:16.025
That it is all in the hands of God Almighty.

00:06:16.105 --> 00:06:19.223
After coming to Sahaja Yoga

00:06:19.304 --> 00:06:21.305
you don't have to worry about anything.

00:06:21.385 --> 00:06:24.129
Leave it in the hands of God

00:06:24.209 --> 00:06:26.672
and everything will work out.

00:06:26.752 --> 00:06:33.768
There is no need for you to go on telling people that

00:06:33.848 --> 00:06:37.930
"Oh, I am so much worried, I have no money,
I have no money."

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:41.348
That shows that you are not yet Sahaja yogis.

00:06:41.428 --> 00:06:47.813
So, if you have to improve those who are your neighbors

00:06:47.894 --> 00:06:50.263
or your friends or your country,

00:06:50.343 --> 00:06:57.190
first of all you have to be very mature Sahaja yoginis.

00:06:58.329 --> 00:07:02.234
So the Lakshmi is already awakened within you.

00:07:02.314 --> 00:07:07.457
She resides in your Nabhi Chakra.

00:07:07.537 --> 00:07:10.744
So with your Lakshmi awakened,

00:07:10.825 --> 00:07:14.795
why should you worry about money?

00:07:14.963 --> 00:07:23.754
So then, this last, Her symbolic hand She says that

00:07:23.835 --> 00:07:28.364
"Those who are under your protection,
you must look after them."

00:07:28.444 --> 00:07:32.360
That means you have to bless everyone

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.400
who comes in contact with you,

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.577
and you have to worry about all the people

00:07:37.689 --> 00:07:39.743
who are under your control.

00:07:39.823 --> 00:07:45.510
So the Lakshmi symbol is not only for the ladies,
but more for the men.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:50.555
A man who is in the business
has to respect his wife and

00:07:50.678 --> 00:07:53.232
his wife should be respectable.

00:07:53.312 --> 00:07:58.151
If she is not,
then auspiciousness will not come in that family.

00:07:58.231 --> 00:08:02.567
So, you get all these blessings of Lakshmi

00:08:02.647 --> 00:08:07.317
if your housewife is good person.

00:08:07.528 --> 00:08:15.432
This symbol of Lakshmi is expressing a kind

00:08:15.512 --> 00:08:24.916
of a personality that is expected of a woman or a man

00:08:24.996 --> 00:08:29.230
who have got the blessings of money.

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:33.438
So, that is the -- I was telling you about the first day

00:08:33.518 --> 00:08:35.888
what is it, second day what is it,

00:08:36.035 --> 00:08:40.118
but main thing is that on a Diwali day

00:08:40.223 --> 00:08:44.145
we have to worship the Lakshmi.

00:08:44.444 --> 00:08:47.532
So, today when we are worshipping Lakshmi,

00:08:47.613 --> 00:08:50.720
the men also have to know that they have to have

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:54.000
a complete balance in life,

00:08:54.115 --> 00:08:59.865
So the there are, as I said, many aspects,

00:08:59.946 --> 00:09:02.361
but one of them, very important is that

00:09:02.441 --> 00:09:08.805
Shri Rama killed Ravanna on ten days before they say,

00:09:08.886 --> 00:09:14.802
and was crowned on the ...

00:09:14.883 --> 00:09:19.121
I mean today. He was crowned today.

00:09:19.873 --> 00:09:26.052
So His wife was Sita, She was also made the Queen,

00:09:26.133 --> 00:09:32.455
and in their life it is shown how She remained

00:09:32.552 --> 00:09:36.036
absolutely dedicated to Him.

00:09:36.117 --> 00:09:43.582
So in Sahaja culture we have to be special people.

00:09:43.663 --> 00:09:47.538
We cannot be like other people who are just running after

00:09:47.619 --> 00:09:53.586
money and doing everything just to ruin themselves.

00:09:53.666 --> 00:09:58.416
So that, in Sahaja culture we have to meditate,

00:09:58.497 --> 00:10:03.068
get our satisfaction about everything within ourselves,

00:10:03.149 --> 00:10:08.899
and also we have to be like the Lakshmi children,

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:12.141
the children of Lakshmi.

00:10:12.227 --> 00:10:16.565
So there are two aspects of this thing we have understood

00:10:16.646 --> 00:10:21.646
is that Lakshmi fulfils all our monetary needs,

00:10:21.727 --> 00:10:28.059
plus also She gives us all the balance, all the joy,

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:31.081
all the bliss in the family.

00:10:31.161 --> 00:10:39.077
Now the problem is with us that unless and until we

00:10:39.158 --> 00:10:43.075
meditate, unless and until we reach that state of

00:10:43.156 --> 00:10:48.550
satisfaction, we cannot see the work of this divine power.

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:55.225
If all the people from Eastern countries could worship

00:10:55.306 --> 00:11:01.799
the Lakshmi or you can say worship their own Kundalini,

00:11:01.961 --> 00:11:10.200
then whole of this problem of money will be solved;

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:13.815
and such a change will come that those countries which

00:11:13.895 --> 00:11:17.179
today do appear to be poorer than the rest

00:11:17.271 --> 00:11:19.023
of the European world,

00:11:19.104 --> 00:11:24.241
will become quite rich by the blessings of Shri Lakshmi.

00:11:24.321 --> 00:11:33.510
Now I have to take you to a very subtler side of life,

00:11:33.591 --> 00:11:38.579
and that subtler side is that with the blessings

00:11:38.688 --> 00:11:43.481
of Shri Lakshmi or Mahalakshmi, now you have achieved

00:11:43.592 --> 00:11:46.319
your Self-realization.

00:11:46.399 --> 00:11:56.974
And the Mahalakshmi Principle is that you rise much above

00:11:57.054 --> 00:12:02.885
your mundane life into the realm of Self-realization.

00:12:02.965 --> 00:12:09.913
So by Her blessings you become like lotuses yourselves.

00:12:09.994 --> 00:12:14.244
Now you become the another aspect of Diwali,

00:12:14.412 --> 00:12:18.563
which means "the rows of lights".

00:12:18.883 --> 00:12:28.033
Shri Rama's crowning or any other aspect of Shri Lakshmi

00:12:28.114 --> 00:12:33.400
here now becomes your own crowning.

00:12:33.481 --> 00:12:37.988
That is, you have now entered into the Kingdom of God,

00:12:38.069 --> 00:12:44.550
and once you are there then automatically, as the citizens

00:12:44.631 --> 00:12:48.523
of God's Kingdom, you are blessed.

00:12:48.604 --> 00:12:57.321
And as you become the lotuses then you start spreading
your fragrance all around.

00:12:57.466 --> 00:13:03.383
The generosity at another level, at a lower level,

00:13:03.464 --> 00:13:08.593
is transformed into this universal love.

00:13:08.674 --> 00:13:15.922
Whatever you gain, whatever joy, satisfaction, vibrations,

00:13:16.003 --> 00:13:20.749
knowledge, all that you want to give it to others.

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:24.059
You want to spread it because now you've got the reality

00:13:24.159 --> 00:13:26.217
and you don't want to keep it to yourself,

00:13:26.298 --> 00:13:30.360
you think it is very important that everyone in the world

00:13:30.445 --> 00:13:32.901
should know about Reality.

00:13:32.982 --> 00:13:36.809
This is significant in putting these lights,

00:13:36.889 --> 00:13:39.474
that now you are the lights.
