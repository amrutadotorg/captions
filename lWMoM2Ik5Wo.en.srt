1
00:06:54,998 --> 00:07:00,976
Today is the sixth day of Navaratri.

2
00:07:11,114 --> 00:07:15,607
There have been many incarnations
of the Goddess

3
00:07:15,632 --> 00:07:19,952
for different, different purposes.

4
00:07:24,203 --> 00:07:33,073
But when the great saints
introspect themselves,

5
00:07:33,098 --> 00:07:36,614
who were worshipping the Mother,

6
00:07:36,647 --> 00:07:47,037
they found out that what
She has done for us.

7
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:51,639
The other day I told you
the dharma

8
00:07:51,664 --> 00:07:59,209
is the innate valency of human beings.
And they are ten.

9
00:07:59,234 --> 00:08:06,088
This is already established within us,
but we deviate,

10
00:08:06,113 --> 00:08:11,112
deviate from dharma and all
the problems come in,

11
00:08:11,137 --> 00:08:18,448
because to leave the dharma
is not a human quality.

12
00:08:20,064 --> 00:08:27,489
But Goddess Herself has done so many
things for us already, within us,

13
00:08:27,514 --> 00:08:31,238
though we are not aware of it.

14
00:08:31,847 --> 00:08:37,131
It is said that “ya Devi sarva
bhuteshu” -

15
00:08:37,156 --> 00:08:42,314
"all those whom You have created",
- means mostly the human beings -

16
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:49,762
"What do You do? As what do You exist
inside the human beings? ”.

17
00:08:52,161 --> 00:08:58,651
Now, just introspect if you have
these qualities within you or not,

18
00:08:58,692 --> 00:09:08,215
because they are given to you by
the Goddess, by the Shakti within you.

19
00:09:10,945 --> 00:09:18,501
Like: ”Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
shanti rupena samstitha”.

20
00:09:18,526 --> 00:09:26,315
is very important, that You exist
within the human beings as peace.

21
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:33,153
Do you find thus human beings
who are peaceful within and without?

22
00:09:33,178 --> 00:09:38,024
Very difficult. But She has given
you that,

23
00:09:38,049 --> 00:09:42,801
She has given you that peace
which you have to achieve.

24
00:09:42,826 --> 00:09:50,096
Now it comes, because you have fallen
off your human dharmas.

25
00:09:50,121 --> 00:09:54,445
So this peace that She has given you,
you have to achieve

26
00:09:54,470 --> 00:10:00,401
through your ascent, through
the Kundalini awakening.

27
00:10:00,426 --> 00:10:10,469
You are excited, all right.
Or, you want to take revenge,

28
00:10:10,494 --> 00:10:17,618
you want to hurt others,
you want to trouble others;

29
00:10:17,643 --> 00:10:21,895
you enjoy sometimes,
even as sahaja yogis

30
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:28,562
people enjoy hurting others,
troubling others.

31
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:32,572
So, the second one She says is:

32
00:10:32,597 --> 00:10:39,584
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
pritti rupena samsthita”.

33
00:10:39,609 --> 00:10:43,998
Pritti  is the quality of loving,

34
00:10:44,023 --> 00:10:51,868
that a human being has been given
the quality of loving.

35
00:10:51,893 --> 00:10:55,098
 But, it’s not there.

36
00:10:55,123 --> 00:11:02,154
Because first nonsensical thing
human beings have is jealousy.

37
00:11:04,162 --> 00:11:08,925
Now, supposing I give some present
to somebody,

38
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:11,576
and some present to another one.

39
00:11:11,601 --> 00:11:17,288
Even in Sahaja Yoga they feel
jealous. Very surprising.

40
00:11:17,313 --> 00:11:23,173
How can you, when the Goddess
has given you the quality to love?

41
00:11:23,198 --> 00:11:32,015
Very, very common nonsense about it
is that human beings are very jealous.

42
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,775
But as sahaja yogis you should
not do,

43
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:41,109
because that quality that the Goddess
has given you is of loving.

44
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:45,092
That quality should be shown -
on the contrary you are very jealous.

45
00:11:45,117 --> 00:11:50,669
That means you are not a sahaja yogi,
blessed by Shri Mataji - no.

46
00:11:50,694 --> 00:11:55,330
If you are blessed, then you will have
no jealousy whatsoever.

47
00:11:55,355 --> 00:12:00,379
And this jealousy sometimes it goes
to this extent that

48
00:12:00,404 --> 00:12:09,678
"Now, we are, say, from Cabella,
so you are from Albera. Finished!"

49
00:12:09,703 --> 00:12:14,260
These so close to each other.

50
00:12:14,285 --> 00:12:22,011
Just like the two nostrils together.
But there will be jealousy.

51
00:12:22,036 --> 00:12:26,481
There will be jealousy about,
”Why not Mother come to my country,

52
00:12:26,506 --> 00:12:30,350
if You can go to that country”.

53
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,670
So this comes also from the ignorance
that

54
00:12:33,695 --> 00:12:39,600
“This is mine, this is mine,
this is yours”.

55
00:12:40,465 --> 00:12:49,762
This jealousy starts in such a funny
manner that we do not realize also

56
00:12:49,787 --> 00:12:58,757
that She has given us the power to love.
Tremendous power to love.

57
00:13:00,563 --> 00:13:04,917
Inauspicious power, our cannot be.

58
00:13:04,942 --> 00:13:10,437
But auspicious, dharmic power
to love somebody.

59
00:13:10,462 --> 00:13:18,017
Means without any lust and greed,
without any jealousy.

60
00:13:18,042 --> 00:13:22,546
But the human mind has developed
itself so cunning

61
00:13:22,571 --> 00:13:27,723
that it is proud that it can be
jealous of someone.

62
00:13:27,748 --> 00:13:33,066
Out of this jealousy only greed
comes in, as I told you.

63
00:13:33,091 --> 00:13:38,817
Is a fact, because you feel jealous
- so you want to buy the same thing.

64
00:13:38,842 --> 00:13:41,984
Then you must compete with others.

65
00:13:42,009 --> 00:13:48,455
If somebody has got a job better than
yours, then you must compete with him.

66
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:56,659
These things are all destructive and
the powers of Goddess are constructive.

67
00:13:56,684 --> 00:14:05,113
She gives you all the powers
that are absolutely constructive.

68
00:14:05,138 --> 00:14:10,939
Then She says, “Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu”,
the saints have said it,

69
00:14:10,964 --> 00:14:14,446
- "kshama rupena samsthita”.

70
00:14:14,471 --> 00:14:21,005
Kshama is what you call
is the forgiveness.

71
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:24,861
Forgiveness from the heart.

72
00:14:24,886 --> 00:14:30,225
All right, somebody has been cruel
to you, has been nasty to you,

73
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:33,207
has exploited you, has troubled you,

74
00:14:33,232 --> 00:14:39,084
but you have the power, greater power
to forgive.

75
00:14:39,109 --> 00:14:44,737
Do we use that power to forgive?

76
00:14:48,605 --> 00:14:56,169
Then for relaxing also, what does
She do, that She gives you the sleep.

77
00:14:56,194 --> 00:15:01,385
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
nidra rupena samsthita”.

78
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:06,385
When you are tired and you
can’t sleep

79
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:12,827
She makes you sleep. She relaxes you.
So the power of relaxation She does

80
00:15:12,852 --> 00:15:17,037
because She acts through parasympathetic
nervous system.

81
00:15:17,062 --> 00:15:21,912
The sympathetic nervous system
can excite you, can depress you.

82
00:15:21,937 --> 00:15:27,858
But the parasympathetic relaxes you,
relaxes your heart,

83
00:15:27,883 --> 00:15:31,905
relaxes your body and completely
feel relaxed

84
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:35,931
and sleeping in the lap of your Mother.

85
00:15:35,956 --> 00:15:40,409
But there are many people
who cannot sleep.

86
00:15:41,075 --> 00:15:48,422
Because they are thinking about
something they have to achieve.

87
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:53,699
If you cannot sleep, then something
wrong with you.

88
00:15:53,724 --> 00:15:57,803
And when you cannot sleep
I also cannot sleep.

89
00:15:57,828 --> 00:16:04,757
Whatever collectively happening
also works on Me.

90
00:16:04,782 --> 00:16:11,436
Anything wrong you do, that works
on Me, specially collectively.

91
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:19,149
So you cannot sleep because you are
thinking of things which are of no value.

92
00:16:19,174 --> 00:16:21,539
Now, to overcome that in Sahaja Yoga

93
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:25,020
we know we have to go into
thoughtless awareness.

94
00:16:25,045 --> 00:16:29,321
But when your ego is working or...

95
00:16:29,346 --> 00:16:33,885
This child is very disturbing. I've seen
him all the time running about.

96
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:39,174
Better tell him. Whose son is he?

97
00:16:43,332 --> 00:16:48,418
You see, in India you’ll find children
absolutely keeping quiet.

98
00:16:48,443 --> 00:16:56,196
Why? Because the mother takes up
the responsibility to train the child.

99
00:16:56,221 --> 00:16:59,971
So many programs you have had,
have you ever seen

100
00:16:59,996 --> 00:17:03,684
any child running about? Yesterday also
they were running about here.

101
00:17:03,709 --> 00:17:09,526
The reason is mother doesn’t take
responsibility as a mother

102
00:17:09,551 --> 00:17:14,027
to see that the children are properly
brought up.

103
00:17:14,052 --> 00:17:18,327
Even you are so old, but I have
to tell you.

104
00:17:18,352 --> 00:17:24,196
Whatever is good for you, for your
society, a new generation that has come.

105
00:17:24,221 --> 00:17:30,090
In this new generation if you still
are not behaving in a proper way,

106
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:34,213
in abnormal way, how can you
impress others?

107
00:17:34,238 --> 00:17:37,785
So, Mother has to tell you.

108
00:17:42,972 --> 00:17:51,894
The most interesting thing that
the Mother has put in you is

109
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:58,282
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
bhranti rupena samsthita”.

110
00:17:58,307 --> 00:18:02,102
She puts you into delusion,

111
00:18:02,127 --> 00:18:06,844
because sometimes the children
cannot understand

112
00:18:06,869 --> 00:18:13,225
unless and until they face the delusion.
They have to face the delusion.

113
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:18,853
She allows, allows you to go wrong

114
00:18:18,878 --> 00:18:23,574
to a point where you discover
you are lost.

115
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:26,835
Very important it is that She plays,

116
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:30,587
this is the Mahamaya part
as they say.

117
00:18:30,612 --> 00:18:34,778
And this is discussed
in every religion

118
00:18:34,803 --> 00:18:39,647
that we get lost with this delusion.

119
00:18:39,672 --> 00:18:44,251
Now, what are the delusions
we have?

120
00:18:44,276 --> 00:18:48,181
We have the delusions
of ego.

121
00:18:48,206 --> 00:18:53,459
Ego for men as if they are
very powerful,

122
00:18:53,484 --> 00:19:00,034
 that they can do what they like and they
are not going to be punished for it.

123
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:04,449
For women they too behave
in the same manner.

124
00:19:04,474 --> 00:19:09,315
They don’t understand that
this is a delusion

125
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:17,833
the Mother has given into us for us
to find out that we are in the wrong.

126
00:19:17,858 --> 00:19:22,980
Because if you tell somebody,
“This is wrong, you don’t do it”,

127
00:19:23,005 --> 00:19:28,066
still they are not matured enough
so they’ll go on doing wrong things.

128
00:19:28,091 --> 00:19:33,330
So the Mother says, “All right, go on.
Very nice, very good. Very good thing.

129
00:19:33,355 --> 00:19:37,722
You’ll jump in the sea? – Jump”.

130
00:19:38,212 --> 00:19:44,797
Then when you realize that you
have been in a delusion,

131
00:19:44,822 --> 00:19:47,885
then only you can return back.

132
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:52,219
Otherwise without any problem
you cannot return.

133
00:19:52,244 --> 00:20:03,503
So many of you are so obstinate,
so self-conscious.

134
00:20:03,528 --> 00:20:08,268
Whatever one may tell you,
you will not listen.

135
00:20:08,293 --> 00:20:14,854
Whatever way you may try to convince,
on a mental level, you won’t.

136
00:20:14,879 --> 00:20:20,889
So, the bhranti, the delusion,
is beyond the mind.

137
00:20:20,914 --> 00:20:24,212
It is beyond the mind.

138
00:20:24,237 --> 00:20:31,245
It works out sometimes very well
for difficult people.

139
00:20:31,621 --> 00:20:38,897
Now, when you are in a position
of a Mother

140
00:20:38,922 --> 00:20:45,851
you don’t want Your child to be ruined, naturally.

141
00:20:45,876 --> 00:20:50,324
She feels responsible,
and She thinks that:

142
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:54,382
“Now they have got connection
with the Divine,

143
00:20:54,407 --> 00:20:57,851
and this connection should not
be broken,

144
00:20:57,876 --> 00:21:02,964
that they should be all the time
blessed and be happy.

145
00:21:02,989 --> 00:21:06,640
All this is within us,

146
00:21:07,278 --> 00:21:12,986
within us, built-in, from our
very childhood,

147
00:21:13,011 --> 00:21:19,872
but we forget, slowly, slowly
we start losing it.

148
00:21:19,897 --> 00:21:24,965
Maybe the conditioning is such
or maybe the ego is such,

149
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:32,698
and maybe that they forget that
they are realized souls.

150
00:21:32,723 --> 00:21:38,618
I’m talking to you - to people who are
realized souls. I’m not talking

151
00:21:38,643 --> 00:21:45,306
to people who are already lost or who
may be on their way to Sahaja Yoga.

152
00:21:45,331 --> 00:21:49,768
But the way you are brought up,
the way you have been told

153
00:21:49,793 --> 00:21:57,526
very sweetly with love, with affection,
with kindness,

154
00:21:57,551 --> 00:22:03,051
and if you don’t understand that,
then you go into bhranti.

155
00:22:03,076 --> 00:22:05,185
For example, it is also said that,

156
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:12,122
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
lajja rupena samsthita”.

157
00:22:12,939 --> 00:22:18,558
Lajja, I don’t know how to describe,
it’s not shyness.

158
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:27,634
It is a kind of a shame about
your body.

159
00:22:28,898 --> 00:22:35,598
Now they have beauty contests. India
also they had beauty contest.

160
00:22:35,623 --> 00:22:40,201
Why are you writing?
What is he writing?

161
00:22:40,226 --> 00:22:45,393
There’s no need to write, there will be
a tape. Alright?

162
00:22:46,444 --> 00:22:49,610
Lajja rupena samsthita:

163
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:55,802
means you have to have shame
of your body.

164
00:22:56,691 --> 00:23:00,469
That’s specially for women.

165
00:23:00,494 --> 00:23:09,125
As a child you will see, women are
very shy.

166
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:12,206
See, little girls, they are
very shy.

167
00:23:12,231 --> 00:23:15,169
That shyness gradually disappears,

168
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:18,669
but in the beginning they are
even shy of Me.

169
00:23:18,694 --> 00:23:23,129
They come before Me, they’ll put down
their head.

170
00:23:23,154 --> 00:23:28,280
They’ll not even say Namaste.
Very sweet.

171
00:23:28,889 --> 00:23:32,259
And they don’t like people wearing
funny dresses.

172
00:23:32,284 --> 00:23:37,498
I remember My granddaughter once,
she saw one magazine

173
00:23:37,523 --> 00:23:42,379
in which there was a lady in a swimming
dress. She said, “What are you doing?

174
00:23:42,404 --> 00:23:47,475
Better wear your dress, otherwise
my Grandma will come and hit you hard”.

175
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:52,509
To that lady was saying that; and then
she opened and saw a man’s dress

176
00:23:52,534 --> 00:23:57,415
with just a small, little knicker.
I don’t know why they do it.

177
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,515
And then she said, “This one is, seems
to be absolutely shameless fellow.

178
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,849
He is going to have a bad time now.”
And she closed it.

179
00:24:04,874 --> 00:24:08,533
And then she told the maidservant,
“Burn this, burn this off.

180
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:15,418
I don’t want to see.” Such a little
girl she knew that it was wrong.

181
00:24:15,443 --> 00:24:22,595
But the way nowadays we are going
about with the show of our body,

182
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:31,325
and sometimes I feel that all these
designers will die

183
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:38,745
or will get bankrupt, because people
wear such little clothes these days.

184
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:43,562
There is no space for any artist

185
00:24:43,587 --> 00:24:53,214
to show his work or to show his art
how he can dress you up.

186
00:24:53,239 --> 00:25:00,279
In Japan I asked them how - this is long
time back, now Japanese are Americans

187
00:25:00,304 --> 00:25:04,488
but at that time - I said, “How is it
you wear these dresses, these kimonos,

188
00:25:04,513 --> 00:25:12,156
done so well, very expensive and
it takes time to wear that?”.

189
00:25:12,591 --> 00:25:17,804
So they said that, “You see, if God
has made a beautiful body,

190
00:25:17,829 --> 00:25:21,455
then it is His art,

191
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:29,145
and we have to make our art
decorate it.

192
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:34,122
So what we do is to make our art
to decorate it.”

193
00:25:34,147 --> 00:25:38,381
I really liked it, because in India
same thing.

194
00:25:38,406 --> 00:25:41,990
If there is a lady she has
to wear a sari,

195
00:25:42,015 --> 00:25:45,684
which is being made very artfully,
very beautifully,

196
00:25:45,709 --> 00:25:51,935
just to decorate her body,
just to respect the body.

197
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:58,233
But this seems to have gone
with the influence of America,

198
00:25:58,258 --> 00:26:02,331
I should say, which are, they are
brainless people, absolutely brainless,

199
00:26:02,356 --> 00:26:07,548
nothing to learn from them.
Only two-hundred-year-old people

200
00:26:07,573 --> 00:26:11,240
and we start behaving in their
manner,

201
00:26:11,265 --> 00:26:14,291
we don’t see even what is happening
to their country,

202
00:26:14,316 --> 00:26:19,674
what sort of people they are,
how they live, what is their idea,

203
00:26:19,699 --> 00:26:24,269
what is their goal in life. Every false
guru has exploited them,

204
00:26:24,294 --> 00:26:28,421
because they are brainless.
If they had brains

205
00:26:28,446 --> 00:26:31,210
they would never have accepted
them.

206
00:26:31,235 --> 00:26:34,292
Ha, they have brains how to run
a computer

207
00:26:34,317 --> 00:26:37,662
and how to run a television -
mechanical things.

208
00:26:37,687 --> 00:26:43,255
But as far as their own body is concerned,
they don’t know how to manage.

209
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:50,066
In India they had a beauty competition
and many sensible people opposed it,

210
00:26:50,091 --> 00:26:54,957
because it’s like selling your body
and making money.

211
00:26:54,982 --> 00:26:59,405
What is the difference between
prostitution and this?

212
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:05,977
If you get money by selling your body,
then it’s prostitution.

213
00:27:06,002 --> 00:27:09,631
You are not supposed to sell
your body.

214
00:27:09,656 --> 00:27:14,773
That’s not what Goddess has done
to you.

215
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:20,025
But you should dress up well, different,
different occasions are there,

216
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:23,939
for those occasions you have to wear
the way it is.

217
00:27:23,964 --> 00:27:28,024
The other day I gave a very nice
sari which is,

218
00:27:28,049 --> 00:27:31,500
we call as paithani to one lady
as a present.

219
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:39,566
And we had a function for a book,
was inaugurated,

220
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:43,478
and this lady came there. So I said,
“Why didn’t you wear a paithani?”

221
00:27:43,503 --> 00:27:47,576
She said, “What, there is
no wedding on.

222
00:27:47,601 --> 00:27:54,131
How can I wear for this function
paithani? There has to be a wedding.”

223
00:27:54,157 --> 00:27:59,560
Very sweet – “in the wedding
I can wear.”

224
00:27:59,585 --> 00:28:07,280
It is all, you see occasions, places
which are to be celebrated.

225
00:28:07,305 --> 00:28:10,483
Like in India, when women go
to the temple

226
00:28:10,508 --> 00:28:14,087
or to worship the idols or anything,

227
00:28:14,112 --> 00:28:22,542
then they will wear all that is necessary
to face the Goddess, after all.

228
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:28,252
Imagine people coming for this program
here wearing,

229
00:28:28,277 --> 00:28:35,488
I don’t know what they call it, but like
jute, jute clothes - like hippies,

230
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:39,655
what would happen to Me? I would disappear
in thin air, I can tell you this much.

231
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,690
So, one has to have respect
for the body.

232
00:28:42,715 --> 00:28:49,476
That is what She has said first -
that “Lajja rupena samsthita”.

233
00:28:49,501 --> 00:28:55,469
Now you might say that there are people
who are taking the bath in the river

234
00:28:55,494 --> 00:28:59,870
and this and that, and give
justification.

235
00:28:59,895 --> 00:29:04,453
But you are saints! You are
realized souls!

236
00:29:04,478 --> 00:29:07,678
You don’t have to see those people
who are not yet realized

237
00:29:07,703 --> 00:29:11,131
and who are misbehaving.

238
00:29:11,156 --> 00:29:16,965
You must do what a saint should do.

239
00:29:17,419 --> 00:29:21,616
There are so many qualities that
the Goddess has given you.

240
00:29:21,641 --> 00:29:26,502
Another is kshudha rupena
samstitha.

241
00:29:26,527 --> 00:29:32,933
She’s the One who has given us hunger.
We have to eat our food.

242
00:29:32,958 --> 00:29:37,050
Nowadays there’s a fashion of becoming
thin or whatever you may call.

243
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:40,693
And you know so many diseases
have developed.

244
00:29:40,718 --> 00:29:46,013
Anorexia, this thing, that thing,
because women want to eat little.

245
00:29:46,038 --> 00:29:50,474
You can change the things
that you are eating,

246
00:29:50,499 --> 00:29:56,099
but it’s not the aim of life to only
look after your body.

247
00:29:56,124 --> 00:30:03,709
Body is not the only important thing.
What is important is your Spirit.

248
00:30:04,104 --> 00:30:08,830
And She is the One who gives you
the Kundalini.

249
00:30:08,855 --> 00:30:13,723
She is the One who give you a method
by which you’ll ascend.

250
00:30:13,748 --> 00:30:18,088
But all the time worried about
their body.

251
00:30:18,113 --> 00:30:24,764
This is something I can’t understand.
Specially the women who are the shakti.

252
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:33,194
Then another point is that they
follow a fashion.

253
00:30:34,056 --> 00:30:38,131
Fashion is madness.

254
00:30:39,346 --> 00:30:45,673
When I was young I used to wear
My blouses like this only.

255
00:30:45,698 --> 00:30:48,401
But in India also fashion started.

256
00:30:48,426 --> 00:30:52,869
They used to increase the size
of the sleeves,

257
00:30:52,895 --> 00:30:59,500
then decreased the size of the sleeves,
then some went up to here.

258
00:30:59,525 --> 00:31:03,778
I thought, “What is this nonsense?
Why waste money like this?”.

259
00:31:03,803 --> 00:31:06,008
You have a particular design,

260
00:31:06,033 --> 00:31:10,015
and this is traditionally accepted
design, that you should have.

261
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:13,712
Why do you want to go on increasing
and decreasing

262
00:31:13,737 --> 00:31:18,681
the size of your sleeves, according
to the fashion. “This is the fashion”.

263
00:31:18,706 --> 00:31:25,030
Who makes the fashion? Devi?
Devi has made the fashion?

264
00:31:25,055 --> 00:31:32,002
Who has made the fashion? Is these
hungry, greedy people

265
00:31:32,043 --> 00:31:37,027
who are befooling you. And you are
trying to follow fashions.

266
00:31:37,052 --> 00:31:41,541
Now, for example, I told that you must
put oil in your head,

267
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:46,633
at least on Saturday put sufficient oil
and then wash your head.

268
00:31:46,658 --> 00:31:51,784
But you’ll not do that and then
you’ll start losing your hair.

269
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:57,078
I can understand if you have no time,
you are a very busy man - but why?

270
00:31:57,103 --> 00:32:03,727
Why not do something where it is
needed to look after yourself also.

271
00:32:03,752 --> 00:32:07,399
So, you’ll look after your body
to thin down, you’ll lose your hair,

272
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:10,257
eyesight will be weak, your teeth
will be falling,

273
00:32:10,305 --> 00:32:16,088
and you will become very soon
an old hag.

274
00:32:16,704 --> 00:32:22,718
Same with the men, nowadays men are
also going to beauty parlor, I’m told.

275
00:32:22,742 --> 00:32:26,099
Too much money I think, and stupidity
together.

276
00:32:26,124 --> 00:32:31,717
There is no need. If you lead
a good, healthy life

277
00:32:31,742 --> 00:32:35,598
- you have to exercise and meditate.

278
00:32:35,623 --> 00:32:40,171
If you meditate you become peaceful.

279
00:32:40,196 --> 00:32:45,675
With that peace, you’ll be amazed,
you’ll have so much of energy.

280
00:32:45,708 --> 00:32:54,083
So much energy is wasted in thinking.
And what do you think?

281
00:32:54,108 --> 00:32:57,496
If you ask somebody: “What are you
thinking?”

282
00:32:57,521 --> 00:33:02,105
“Everything.” But “everything”
means what?

283
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:07,958
Why do you think so much?
What is the need to think?

284
00:33:07,983 --> 00:33:14,988
It’s a habit, human habit to go on
thinking about everything.

285
00:33:15,013 --> 00:33:20,290
For example, just now, there are
three carpets here.

286
00:33:20,315 --> 00:33:27,927
Now, if I put attention on it I’ll just
see how nice they are; I’ll just enjoy

287
00:33:27,952 --> 00:33:32,681
- enjoy what the artists have done,
that’s all.

288
00:33:32,706 --> 00:33:37,467
No words - nothing. Just the enjoyment
within yourself.

289
00:33:37,492 --> 00:33:41,035
But if you ask somebody else,
he’ll just start saying,

290
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,787
“Oh, this is not good.
That’s not good.

291
00:33:43,812 --> 00:33:48,214
This much some price, that price,
this thing, that thing.”

292
00:33:48,239 --> 00:33:52,110
The joy of that artist is finished.

293
00:33:52,135 --> 00:33:58,131
You cannot get that joy,

294
00:33:59,488 --> 00:34:07,214
that joy about which we are seeking.
What we are seeking is joy,

295
00:34:07,239 --> 00:34:12,450
and even when you have got a way
of doing it you do not achieve it.

296
00:34:12,475 --> 00:34:18,328
Because thinking is a reaction,
reaction to everything,

297
00:34:18,353 --> 00:34:21,600
and it makes the life so miserable.

298
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:26,323
It makes the life of the person who
thinks and of others also.

299
00:34:26,348 --> 00:34:32,136
I’ll give you an example. This whole
thing we got it done

300
00:34:32,161 --> 00:34:37,384
just because it’s very heavy rains
and also we have

301
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:41,260
problems of sometimes snowing.

302
00:34:41,292 --> 00:34:44,536
So I thought that’s a nice thing
to have a nice thing done

303
00:34:44,561 --> 00:34:47,962
and it’s very well done, we got it.

304
00:34:47,987 --> 00:34:53,902
Now, there are thinking people
in this Italy. Lots of them.

305
00:34:53,927 --> 00:35:00,563
That’s why it’s not progressing.
Now, we applied three years back.

306
00:35:00,588 --> 00:35:05,846
Three years they kept our money
locked up in the bank, imagine.

307
00:35:05,871 --> 00:35:10,432
And first time they said, “All right,
everything is fine, it’s all right.

308
00:35:10,457 --> 00:35:16,706
You can have it.” It had seventy
signatures

309
00:35:16,731 --> 00:35:20,407
of these Italians, so-called.

310
00:35:20,432 --> 00:35:24,878
And then they came round to say,
the same people,

311
00:35:24,903 --> 00:35:29,517
“No, no, no, you must change it
to copper”. I said, “Why?”

312
00:35:29,542 --> 00:35:34,310
“Because copper will be aesthetically
very good.”

313
00:35:34,335 --> 00:35:38,822
But don’t they know, stupid people,
that copper will look the same

314
00:35:38,847 --> 00:35:45,914
as they are looking? After one month
only they will have the same colour?

315
00:35:46,535 --> 00:35:49,730
This is the idea of aesthetics,
and now I have told them,

316
00:35:49,755 --> 00:35:55,140
“We don’t want your land, you keep it
to yourself, give us back our money.”

317
00:35:55,165 --> 00:35:58,772
With a simple thing like that.

318
00:35:58,797 --> 00:36:05,731
Why? Because they have a committee,
there is “rejune, bijune, sijune”.

319
00:36:05,756 --> 00:36:08,942
You have to go through all that
nonsense,

320
00:36:08,967 --> 00:36:11,848
because they all sit down on chairs,
very seriously,

321
00:36:11,873 --> 00:36:15,173
“We must discuss, we must consult,
we must ask everyone,

322
00:36:15,198 --> 00:36:20,249
and then this and that”. And ultimately
what comes?

323
00:36:20,274 --> 00:36:25,150
No progress of any kind. There is
no peace.

324
00:36:25,175 --> 00:36:29,688
Maybe, I don’t know, maybe some
underhand dealings are needed,

325
00:36:29,713 --> 00:36:35,000
for which they are feeling shy to tell
Me. I don’t know what is the thing is,

326
00:36:35,025 --> 00:36:40,851
but still I can’t understand when
the one office says “Yes”

327
00:36:40,876 --> 00:36:48,572
and again, when it comes back to it,
it says “No”. Three years.

328
00:36:48,597 --> 00:36:56,485
So, what I am trying to say that
thinking too much is a sign of ego.

329
00:36:56,510 --> 00:37:01,839
But, they don’t find any solutions,
no solutions of any kind.

330
00:37:01,864 --> 00:37:08,148
They’ll never hit the solution. Because
they are just discussing,

331
00:37:08,173 --> 00:37:15,020
arguing, thinking - they have
no solutions.

332
00:37:21,271 --> 00:37:31,256
Now, it is important that sahaja yogis
have to do introspection,

333
00:37:31,281 --> 00:37:38,986
introspection - inward. Introspection
is inward-looking.

334
00:37:39,011 --> 00:37:42,951
Inward-looking. “Why I am thinking?
What am I thinking?

335
00:37:42,976 --> 00:37:46,555
What is the need to think?”.

336
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:53,913
You will become Nirvichara. Don’t allow
your mind to befool you.

337
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:58,161
This mind is like a monkey, I tell you,
it’s really like a monkey.

338
00:37:58,186 --> 00:38:02,110
And when it starts working it makes you
jump from this end to that end,

339
00:38:02,135 --> 00:38:07,469
that end to that end. And if you reach
some conclusions, so-called,

340
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:13,509
and if it is not achieved then you are
the most miserable person.

341
00:38:13,534 --> 00:38:22,988
I have seen people thinning down only
thinking about something which is absurd.

342
00:38:23,013 --> 00:38:25,841
And you can see out of this thinking
what comes out

343
00:38:25,866 --> 00:38:32,488
on a global level also. What is
the need to go to the moon?

344
00:38:32,513 --> 00:38:36,173
So many people are starved,
are dying out.

345
00:38:36,198 --> 00:38:40,679
What is the need to go to Mars?

346
00:38:40,704 --> 00:38:45,146
What are they going to get from there?
Because they formed a habit.

347
00:38:45,171 --> 00:38:47,865
First they came to India, then went
to China,

348
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:54,110
then went to this, then went to that;
they can’t sit down, settle down.

349
00:38:54,135 --> 00:38:58,257
They can’t settle down in the house
also.

350
00:38:58,282 --> 00:39:02,841
Specially men. If you are travelling
by train,

351
00:39:02,866 --> 00:39:07,889
even if the train stops for two minutes
men must get out.

352
00:39:07,922 --> 00:39:11,756
The wife will be worried now. And while
the train will be moving

353
00:39:11,781 --> 00:39:15,165
then they’ll jump in.

354
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:20,426
It’s a cracked brain, I think, like a -
even why say they are like a monkey?

355
00:39:20,451 --> 00:39:24,495
Because monkeys won’t do that.

356
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:31,510
It’s that they cannot stationary
remain in one place.

357
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:36,726
Now, in meditation you have
to sit down, in one place,

358
00:39:36,751 --> 00:39:42,006
not to jump from here to there,
there to there. This is very difficult.

359
00:39:42,031 --> 00:39:46,988
Women have other problems.
While cooking they’ll meditate.

360
00:39:47,013 --> 00:39:49,292
They have no time!

361
00:39:49,317 --> 00:39:53,557
They have their friends, they have
to go to shopping,

362
00:39:53,582 --> 00:39:58,732
to buy things and fill the house
with all kinds of rubbish.

363
00:39:58,757 --> 00:40:02,891
They have no time for anything.
They are also very adventurous.

364
00:40:02,916 --> 00:40:06,382
They want to do business, they want
to do this, they want to do that.

365
00:40:06,407 --> 00:40:09,829
For meditation they have no time.

366
00:40:09,854 --> 00:40:17,812
So, settling down is very important.
Settle down with yourself.

367
00:40:18,232 --> 00:40:25,343
So, once someone told Me, “Mother, if
we settle down, we’ll become very fat.”

368
00:40:26,816 --> 00:40:32,552
All right, doesn’t matter -
but you settle down.

369
00:40:33,563 --> 00:40:39,368
All sorts of excuses are there
not to meditate.

370
00:40:39,393 --> 00:40:46,524
“Yes, I meditate, Mother, but you know,
so difficult in these modern times.

371
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:51,628
There are crises in our lives,
there are problems in our lives.”

372
00:40:51,653 --> 00:40:56,067
 But actually you’ll be amazed, when
there’s a crisis, say, in My family

373
00:40:56,092 --> 00:41:00,361
or in Sahaja Yoga, immediately
I become thoughtless.

374
00:41:00,386 --> 00:41:02,630
Spontaneously I become thoughtless,

375
00:41:02,655 --> 00:41:08,613
because the problem will be solved
by the Paramchaitanya.

376
00:41:08,638 --> 00:41:12,781
The Paramchaitanya is going to solve
the problem, why should I think?

377
00:41:12,806 --> 00:41:15,930
Forget it. Let the Paramchaitanya
look after.

378
00:41:15,955 --> 00:41:18,944
If you don’t depend on your
Paramchaitanya,

379
00:41:18,969 --> 00:41:22,934
it doesn’t help you. Doesn’t give you
any solutions.

380
00:41:22,959 --> 00:41:30,990
Then you go on round and round and round
with your brain and work it out.

381
00:41:31,494 --> 00:41:37,006
This is what you have to know definitely
that you are connected

382
00:41:37,031 --> 00:41:41,621
to the all-pervading Power
of Divine love.

383
00:41:41,646 --> 00:41:47,567
This is not love which is stupid -
love that thinks.

384
00:41:47,592 --> 00:41:53,281
Love that is truth. Love that is
joy.

385
00:41:53,306 --> 00:42:01,098
All this is built in within you, and now
you have got realization,

386
00:42:01,123 --> 00:42:10,441
so instead of evolving yourself, you just
jump into things which are of no value.

387
00:42:10,974 --> 00:42:18,123
And so many Sahaja Yogis get lost.
I was recently told by someone

388
00:42:18,148 --> 00:42:20,632
that we have lost about hundred
sahaja yogis,

389
00:42:20,657 --> 00:42:27,451
because they started following another
sahaja yogi, who started seeing things.

390
00:42:27,975 --> 00:42:31,567
So they also wanted to see.

391
00:42:31,592 --> 00:42:40,176
If you can see something that means
you are not there, simple thing.

392
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:48,103
If I am, say, on the top of a mountain,
then I’m there.

393
00:42:48,128 --> 00:42:51,724
But if I am away from the mountain
I can see it.

394
00:42:51,749 --> 00:42:57,433
The more you see something that means
you are away from it.

395
00:42:57,458 --> 00:42:59,956
Did you follow this point?

396
00:42:59,981 --> 00:43:07,836
So, the subtle, the sukshma,
state is that

397
00:43:07,861 --> 00:43:13,276
where you are yourself that.

398
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:18,272
So, how can you see yourself?

399
00:43:18,297 --> 00:43:22,526
This is the point Sahaja Yogis must
understand. Anybody who can –

400
00:43:22,551 --> 00:43:26,451
“Mother, oh no he can see, he saw
auras around You,

401
00:43:26,476 --> 00:43:32,663
he can see this thing.” So,
how can you see?

402
00:43:32,688 --> 00:43:37,879
Because you are that, you can’t see.
So, all such people

403
00:43:37,904 --> 00:43:42,073
who are very popular sometimes,
in the beginning of Sahaja Yoga

404
00:43:42,098 --> 00:43:50,108
try to control you and befool you.
And then you are thrown out.

405
00:43:50,388 --> 00:43:55,744
Now, this is what we call is
the judgement.

406
00:43:55,769 --> 00:44:02,827
There are sieves and sieves and sieves
through which you have to pass.

407
00:44:03,193 --> 00:44:09,623
Where you get enamoured by this or that, or you fall for this or that,

408
00:44:09,648 --> 00:44:17,819
all these things are there in a step-
by-step how you are arriving.

409
00:44:19,169 --> 00:44:26,977
You are arriving at that point where
your destruction is sure.

410
00:44:27,002 --> 00:44:34,306
Because you have to become the Spirit.
You have to rise in spiritual life.

411
00:44:34,331 --> 00:44:40,161
And if your movement is downward,
who can help you?

412
00:44:40,186 --> 00:44:47,216
This is a very interesting time as I told
you, is the time of judgement.

413
00:44:47,241 --> 00:44:53,596
And at this time we have to be careful
that we are our own judges.

414
00:44:53,621 --> 00:44:58,419
Nobody has to tell you that you are
catching this one and catching that one.

415
00:44:58,444 --> 00:45:04,481
You yourself can feel it what chakras
you are catching.

416
00:45:04,506 --> 00:45:08,596
Whatever I may try on My own

417
00:45:08,621 --> 00:45:13,235
to suck in all your problems,
do whatever is possible,

418
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:20,761
to keep you rising and rising and rising,
but what I feel

419
00:45:20,786 --> 00:45:33,166
that this method of helping you
will not make you so strong,

420
00:45:33,191 --> 00:45:37,264
because you’ll always think that,
“After all, Mother will suck my problem.”

421
00:45:37,289 --> 00:45:42,178
If I get hundred letters, out of them
ninety-nine are of sahaja yogis

422
00:45:42,203 --> 00:45:48,636
who are suffering from this trouble
or that trouble. I’m amazed,

423
00:45:48,661 --> 00:45:56,702
you have all these qualities already
awakened in you, they are in you.

424
00:45:58,145 --> 00:46:01,017
You use them.

425
00:46:02,432 --> 00:46:05,020
Somebody will say, “That fellow
is troubling me,

426
00:46:05,045 --> 00:46:11,071
that wife is troubling me, the husband
troubling me.” Just forgive!

427
00:46:11,096 --> 00:46:18,009
Just forgive! Your power of forgiveness
is poor.

428
00:46:18,034 --> 00:46:22,194
Moreover, more than what the saints
have written

429
00:46:22,219 --> 00:46:31,713
you have got the power of truth.
You know the reality.

430
00:46:32,018 --> 00:46:38,583
Much more than those saints who
have praised the Goddess.

431
00:46:39,147 --> 00:46:43,285
If you could just think as to what
level you are sitting

432
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:50,670
you wouldn’t fall, you wouldn’t go
down that much.

433
00:46:50,695 --> 00:46:56,636
Only problem is you have to know that
your ascent has to be spiritual,

434
00:46:56,661 --> 00:47:04,139
and already these qualities are very
well balanced and put within you.

435
00:47:04,164 --> 00:47:10,105
More than dharma. Dharma maybe,
you have a power

436
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:18,978
to give up or to fall down, but these
powers are never destroyed within you.

437
00:47:19,227 --> 00:47:27,283
I remember once I went to America
first time and I met one gentleman.

438
00:47:27,308 --> 00:47:29,950
The next day he came and he told Me,
“Mother, I am changed,

439
00:47:29,975 --> 00:47:33,556
I am changed, I am changed.”
“What happened?”

440
00:47:33,581 --> 00:47:38,925
“You know, I used to hate my uncle,
I never wanted to talk to him,

441
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:44,670
very angry with him, but this time,
just imagine,

442
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:49,944
yesterday I met him, I went and hugged
him, and kissed him, and I said,

443
00:47:49,969 --> 00:47:52,699
‘Now, I have forgiven you,
completely forgiven you,

444
00:47:52,724 --> 00:47:57,088
now don’t think about feeling guilty
about it.

445
00:47:57,113 --> 00:48:01,680
He started looking at me
like this.’”

446
00:48:02,328 --> 00:48:04,473
So, with the Kundalini awakening

447
00:48:04,498 --> 00:48:10,187
all these beautiful qualities you have
will come up.

448
00:48:10,212 --> 00:48:15,679
And then your generosity,

449
00:48:17,326 --> 00:48:23,848
your beautiful being, which is
enlightened by the Spirit

450
00:48:23,873 --> 00:48:30,722
will prove to the world that Sahaja
Yoga is the truth.

451
00:48:32,205 --> 00:48:40,489
Yesterday’s beautiful dramas
have shown us,

452
00:48:40,514 --> 00:48:45,621
but it should not be a mental
satisfaction within you,

453
00:48:45,646 --> 00:48:48,068
that “I have got the realization,
now I am this”.

454
00:48:48,093 --> 00:48:55,812
No. No. No mental. It’s a state,
it’s a state,

455
00:48:55,837 --> 00:49:00,416
and that state to achieve, you have
to really meditate

456
00:49:00,441 --> 00:49:10,252
and find time for meditation
every night, every morning.

457
00:49:10,277 --> 00:49:14,493
The more you’ll meditate the better
it will be.

458
00:49:14,518 --> 00:49:24,415
No excuses are to be given or to be
convincing to yourself.

459
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:30,661
Everything is unimportant. Your ascent
is very important,

460
00:49:30,686 --> 00:49:36,372
if you really want to save this world
from - in this Kali Yuga.

461
00:49:36,397 --> 00:49:41,245
I think today I have made it
very clear to you

462
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:47,212
what qualities already are instilled
within you.

463
00:49:47,237 --> 00:49:53,793
They are there. They are not dharmas,
but qualities.

464
00:49:53,818 --> 00:49:56,360
They are just within you,

465
00:49:56,385 --> 00:50:02,930
only thing you have turned your attention
to something opposite,

466
00:50:02,955 --> 00:50:08,045
otherwise all these qualities are
already instilled within you.

467
00:50:08,070 --> 00:50:15,209
They are already there. And nothing can
destroy them, except for you yourself.

468
00:50:15,234 --> 00:50:19,820
If you have destroyed them,
nobody can help.

469
00:50:19,845 --> 00:50:23,687
May God bless you all.
