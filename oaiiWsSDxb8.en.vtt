00:00:00.328 --> 00:00:02.585
About which he doesn't know.

00:00:06.055 --> 00:00:09.109
Although in our India

00:00:09.895 --> 00:00:12.311
there has been a lot of work on Yoga

00:00:13.226 --> 00:00:15.758
but because of the onset of English rule

00:00:16.446 --> 00:00:18.593
all of us

00:00:19.492 --> 00:00:21.699
forgot our Great scriptures

00:00:22.247 --> 00:00:25.587
which worked a lot in the field of yoga.

00:00:26.191 --> 00:00:30.168
In Upanishads if you see particularly Shandilya Upanishad etc.,

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.469
it has been written long back that within you

00:00:34.718 --> 00:00:37.286
there is a power named kundalini

00:00:37.847 --> 00:00:40.329
and this power on getting awakened

00:00:41.033 --> 00:00:43.501
you can get your self realisation.

00:00:44.302 --> 00:00:45.898
This I will say certainly that

00:00:46.315 --> 00:00:49.252
very clearly whole outline

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.416
has not been given in these Upnishads.

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:56.771
But it is a matter of controversy

00:00:56.864 --> 00:00:59.449
that our many scriptures, Yogvashishth etc.,

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.770
in many scriptures as well

00:01:01.902 --> 00:01:04.668
it has very clearly been mentioned.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.176
Don't know why do we  consider

00:01:14.527 --> 00:01:17.871
knowledge from foreign countries

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.973
as the best

00:01:21.316 --> 00:01:26.520
and our any asset in this country

00:01:26.949 --> 00:01:28.049
give it least importance

00:01:28.926 --> 00:01:30.654
don't know its importance.

00:01:31.103 --> 00:01:35.233
Its reason may be is that we were under slavery for such a long time

00:01:35.449 --> 00:01:39.485
and we were overwhelmed by these people because they were ruling us.

00:01:42.297 --> 00:01:45.223
Now that we are free

00:01:45.933 --> 00:01:48.427
in that freedom we should observe

00:01:48.742 --> 00:01:51.046
what are our assests

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:53.911
what is our history

00:01:54.247 --> 00:01:59.238
and what did we discover?

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:05.795
India is such a unique country where

00:02:06.841 --> 00:02:12.997
man has  less problems of the outside world

00:02:13.208 --> 00:02:15.397
For example, if in London you have to go out of your home

00:02:15.734 --> 00:02:18.964
at least for fifteen, twenty minutes you have to dress up yourself

00:02:19.165 --> 00:02:20.628
then you can go out.

00:02:21.134 --> 00:02:24.614
In our country too there are so many places

00:02:26.306 --> 00:02:29.701
for example, Himalayas or at high altitudes

00:02:29.902 --> 00:02:33.450
where it is very cold, people don't live there.

00:02:34.306 --> 00:02:39.195
But I have seen in these countries that the problems

00:02:40.529 --> 00:02:47.291
quarelling with everyone all the time go on troubling them so much

00:02:47.878 --> 00:02:52.871
that they are fully lost in that.

00:02:53.262 --> 00:02:57.422
But in India the climate is so good that we sit in open.

00:02:58.592 --> 00:03:01.004
In Russia also you cannot sit in the open.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.673
In any country one cannot sit so much in the open.

00:03:04.931 --> 00:03:06.894
There used to sleep on the floor

00:03:07.095 --> 00:03:09.232
They said, Mother, many people will come to listen to your lecture

00:03:09.433 --> 00:03:10.487
there is no other place than a stadium.

00:03:10.644 --> 00:03:12.187
Stadium too was full to its capacity.

00:03:13.257 --> 00:03:16.003
So this characteristic of India that

00:03:16.204 --> 00:03:18.148
there is neither too much heat nor too cold

00:03:18.413 --> 00:03:22.240
and here at this place we didn't have to struggle against nature.

00:03:23.779 --> 00:03:30.755
So from eternity there were our ancestors.

00:03:30.956 --> 00:03:36.313
Those ancestors thought that finally our life is a daily affair.

00:03:36.514 --> 00:03:40.588
Daily we get crushed in our life.

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:42.631
It has some or the other meaning.

00:03:43.066 --> 00:03:46.848
And because our climate was like that

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:52.415
people definitely paid their attention more towards themselves

00:03:52.556 --> 00:03:55.426
than towards foreign countries.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.279
They didn't have any need to think about

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.065
the questions of outside topics

00:04:01.266 --> 00:04:02.650
how to find out a solution of those problems?

00:04:02.864 --> 00:04:04.302
They knew only this much that

00:04:04.503 --> 00:04:07.488
now everything boarding and lodging is almost okay.

00:04:07.566 --> 00:04:10.347
Even if you go into jungles, you can live in jungles too.

00:04:10.548 --> 00:04:12.881
There you can live by eating fruits and berries.

00:04:12.965 --> 00:04:15.387
This type of climate too

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:21.176
we should say that God has blessed us specially of such a country.

00:04:21.615 --> 00:04:23.968
This country is a great country

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:27.732
and there is a special blessing of God for this country

00:04:28.227 --> 00:04:31.587
and because of this blessing

00:04:32.025 --> 00:04:36.476
from eternity people of this country tried to find out

00:04:36.566 --> 00:04:39.639
why did we come in this world?

00:04:40.235 --> 00:04:44.947
And what for our life God has made?

00:04:45.148 --> 00:04:48.513
Why has He created us in the form of human beings?

00:04:49.302 --> 00:04:57.184
With this inspiration many people meditated in the jungles.

00:04:57.563 --> 00:05:01.062
They found out that our life has been created

00:05:01.375 --> 00:05:03.758
so that, we could go to the kingdom of God

00:05:04.563 --> 00:05:10.272
and their joy, and their love may be rewarded by that.

00:05:12.026 --> 00:05:17.439
God created the whole world and this universe.

00:05:17.528 --> 00:05:22.267
and after that left a human being from amoeba to this state

00:05:22.468 --> 00:05:26.189
and that only for the sake of being in that state of happiness

00:05:27.116 --> 00:05:32.005
that God's love and comfort we may be able to feel.

00:05:32.013 --> 00:05:34.976
So, God created this world.

00:05:36.605 --> 00:05:39.644
Every body sang this and everbody said

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:45.562
saints in this Maharashtra, nobody knows in how many ways have said

00:05:45.758 --> 00:05:51.275
that SUKHAKA SANSAR (comfortable world) I will make.

00:05:51.773 --> 00:05:57.053
That has been explained in PSAYDAN (written by Sant Mauli Dnyaneshwar)

00:05:57.209 --> 00:06:01.501
and the beautiful picture of the world that he made

00:06:01.651 --> 00:06:05.228
that you can see today in sahajyoga.

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:10.299
Whatever prophesy has been made, whatever has been said,

00:06:10.368 --> 00:06:13.322
whatever they desired by heart

00:06:13.523 --> 00:06:16.236
the time has come to be rewarded by success.

00:06:18.013 --> 00:06:20.355
I will say that Sahajyoga

00:06:20.556 --> 00:06:22.785
is not today's, it is from the beginning of the creation.

00:06:23.515 --> 00:06:31.630
In the olden times, there used to be only one guru and one disciple.

00:06:33.085 --> 00:06:37.199
This tradition in twefth century, specially in Maharashtra

00:06:40.743 --> 00:06:42.751
Shri Ghyaneshwar ji broke.

00:06:42.952 --> 00:06:47.092
He too after propitiating his brother,who was his Guru

00:06:47.293 --> 00:06:48.472
broke this tradition.

00:06:48.775 --> 00:06:54.600
Atleast  to Me about this clearly in Ghyaneshwari.........

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:59.475
Before that you see nobody knows in how many scriptures

00:06:59.562 --> 00:07:00.683
there is no mention about it.

00:07:00.884 --> 00:07:03.687
and about that it has been specifically explained.

00:07:04.339 --> 00:07:06.885
Those who had never read Sanskrit

00:07:07.068 --> 00:07:09.468
those who did not see their old books

00:07:09.669 --> 00:07:18.733
those who give western education highest importance.

00:07:18.934 --> 00:07:22.268
are blind people, will never be able to understand it

00:07:22.276 --> 00:07:26.114
that in this country how many great things are there

00:07:28.098 --> 00:07:29.868
In all these things

00:07:31.886 --> 00:07:35.953
Whatever you will come across, that is only just one thing

00:07:36.506 --> 00:07:40.088
what for is a man's life made?

00:07:40.289 --> 00:07:41.837
What is its meaning?

00:07:42.424 --> 00:07:43.882
Where has he to go?

00:07:43.967 --> 00:07:49.549
Is his life made for fighting with this and that

00:07:49.558 --> 00:07:52.430
solving the problems, go on quarrelling and abusing people

00:07:52.631 --> 00:07:56.084
or go on depositing insurance policies

00:07:56.202 --> 00:07:58.034
or do some better work than this

00:07:58.235 --> 00:08:00.438
and grab the money of the whole world

00:08:01.188 --> 00:08:02.945
Is his life made for that?

00:08:03.853 --> 00:08:05.516
We should think

00:08:05.717 --> 00:08:09.066
Is our life made for such petty things?

00:08:09.439 --> 00:08:11.923
When I came to Poona in the beginning, everybody told ME

00:08:12.124 --> 00:08:14.379
"Mother, here your work will not be done at all". I said ,"Why?"

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:17.370
They said ,"They all eat money. They don't eat food at all."

00:08:17.878 --> 00:08:19.778
But, this Punya Patnam

00:08:19.979 --> 00:08:25.784
about this it is mentioned in so many scriptures

00:08:26.527 --> 00:08:29.295
In this Punya Patnam, do all people eat only money?

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:31.561
Has all bribery spread?

00:08:32.445 --> 00:08:33.814
Why has it happened?

00:08:34.033 --> 00:08:36.524
Why did we reduce ourselves to such a state?

00:08:36.645 --> 00:08:41.744
Because that which is desire within us to seek truth disappeared.

00:08:43.164 --> 00:08:46.409
We lost that desire, we are unable to understand that

00:08:46.805 --> 00:08:49.998
that we have to find out the truth

00:08:50.319 --> 00:08:52.888
Till we do not find out the truth

00:08:53.084 --> 00:08:56.215
till then we can never get solution.

00:08:56.355 --> 00:08:57.997
You become a millioner

00:08:58.083 --> 00:09:00.485
you eat lot of money , become a millioner

00:09:00.756 --> 00:09:04.124
but you can never get health.

00:09:04.369 --> 00:09:06.571
You can never get happiness.

00:09:06.772 --> 00:09:08.077
You cannot get love

00:09:08.278 --> 00:09:11.508
and everybody will speak against you at your back.

00:09:12.766 --> 00:09:19.445
Not only this, people in this India are acquainted with great ideals

00:09:19.867 --> 00:09:22.042
that any person may get tempted

00:09:22.243 --> 00:09:26.453
to bow his head to the photograph, however great he may be.

00:09:27.171 --> 00:09:30.511
We are the carriers of such a great culture.

00:09:30.764 --> 00:09:33.741
Having such a great culture

00:09:34.066 --> 00:09:37.844
Why have we gone down and now

00:09:37.961 --> 00:09:41.379
is there any way to escape is a separate question?

00:09:41.489 --> 00:09:45.094
If somebody asks Me, I will say that it is good in one way

00:09:45.295 --> 00:09:48.618
that it has at least created an illusion within us.

00:09:48.697 --> 00:09:51.646
We started thinking why did we fall like that?

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:54.093
Why are we facing this plight

00:09:54.294 --> 00:09:57.257
and why are we doing it at a low level?

00:09:58.596 --> 00:09:59.596
Above all

00:10:01.679 --> 00:10:07.217
when a man thinks what after this? After all why this?

00:10:07.331 --> 00:10:09.275
And then he becomes a seeker.

00:10:09.476 --> 00:10:11.736
And those who are seekers

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:14.898
only he can get self realisation.

00:10:15.356 --> 00:10:18.114
and he who is not (a seeker) he may say anything

00:10:18.315 --> 00:10:20.783
however he may shout, he cannot get his self realisation.

00:10:21.128 --> 00:10:22.228
He is not a realised soul.

00:10:23.455 --> 00:10:26.305
Because when a person thinks in this direction,

00:10:26.506 --> 00:10:29.215
after all why did he come in this world?

00:10:29.457 --> 00:10:31.843
he points towards the truth

00:10:32.422 --> 00:10:35.100
and he wants to know the truth.

00:10:35.368 --> 00:10:38.728
I who am born as a human being, what is its importance?

00:10:38.939 --> 00:10:41.596
what is my status?

00:10:41.761 --> 00:10:45.287
To which level i am going?

00:10:45.418 --> 00:10:48.315
When a human being starts thinking all this

00:10:48.529 --> 00:10:50.494
he becomes a seeker.

00:10:50.701 --> 00:10:52.527
and when he becomes a seeker

00:10:52.724 --> 00:10:57.659
then for him, his kundalini, his own mother herself

00:10:57.677 --> 00:11:00.007
that is settled within him, gets enlightened in a sahaj way.

00:11:01.109 --> 00:11:04.749
In this case, in Russia I tell you, is so surprising

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:09.096
that 14 Thousand and 16 thousand, there are also such people

00:11:09.299 --> 00:11:11.255
and all of them get realisation.

00:11:11.486 --> 00:11:14.868
I used to think that there they had never heard the name of God

00:11:15.048 --> 00:11:17.843
not knowing what is kundalini.

00:11:18.067 --> 00:11:19.568
Seeing just My photograph

00:11:19.769 --> 00:11:22.765
thousands of people came and got realisation.

00:11:23.058 --> 00:11:26.487
I observed that all their writers are

00:11:26.688 --> 00:11:32.064
too much in search of their inner mind, by introspection

00:11:32.337 --> 00:11:35.000
Their writers have shown that whatever work a man does

00:11:35.201 --> 00:11:37.300
always gropes for an answer.

00:11:37.502 --> 00:11:40.748
Why i do this? why i did this? what for i am doiing so?

00:11:40.949 --> 00:11:42.737
What is my intention?

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:44.564
So,

00:11:45.741 --> 00:11:48.698
although in our country, people talk a lot about religion,

00:11:48.899 --> 00:11:49.969
have a great command on dharma

00:11:50.157 --> 00:11:54.546
and you have just seen that sadam sahib and  America

00:11:54.747 --> 00:11:58.135
has spoiled the show in the name of God, all the work

00:11:59.831 --> 00:12:02.020
quarrelling, create trouble

00:12:02.221 --> 00:12:04.537
kill this, kill that, supress everybody.

00:12:05.353 --> 00:12:07.228
All this is happening

00:12:07.429 --> 00:12:10.863
because a human being is not secured within himself.

00:12:11.616 --> 00:12:15.433
He doesn't know that God takes care of everybody's security

00:12:15.903 --> 00:12:17.050
But He loves everyone.

00:12:17.251 --> 00:12:20.691
Not only this, He is the Father of all fathers

00:12:21.715 --> 00:12:22.715
Absolute

00:12:24.935 --> 00:12:26.685
Ocean of mercy

00:12:27.085 --> 00:12:31.069
And we need not be insecured so much.

00:12:31.567 --> 00:12:35.288
And simply by My saying you may accept that thing, is not possible

00:12:35.586 --> 00:12:41.008
that I say that God's shelter is always spread over you.

00:12:42.352 --> 00:12:45.586
But you can surely feel it

00:12:45.793 --> 00:12:49.289
You can know it, in Marathi it is called ZANI.

00:12:49.515 --> 00:12:51.747
In Sanskrit it is called BODH

00:12:51.948 --> 00:12:54.356
or VIDH from which the word 'VED' has originated.

00:12:55.356 --> 00:12:58.724
The time has come that you can know it

00:12:58.925 --> 00:13:02.280
that it that God's grace is spread all around us.

00:13:03.584 --> 00:13:08.632
And when we get this power, then only

00:13:09.246 --> 00:13:11.053
In fact

00:13:11.254 --> 00:13:13.292
your yoga takes place.

00:13:13.691 --> 00:13:17.117
Before that, to talk about yoga, to stand on your head

00:13:17.318 --> 00:13:19.735
and to break your bones is not yoga.

00:13:20.872 --> 00:13:23.467
And people made yogas of different types.

00:13:24.012 --> 00:13:26.980
Yoga is not made, it takes place.

00:13:27.835 --> 00:13:32.293
which is living action in our evolution

00:13:32.689 --> 00:13:34.645
just as we became human beings

00:13:34.934 --> 00:13:39.044
you have not been turned into human being from a monkey

00:13:39.245 --> 00:13:40.650
you became so.

00:13:40.671 --> 00:13:44.593
the same way, from the state of a human being

00:13:44.794 --> 00:13:46.924
you go to a higher state.

00:13:47.219 --> 00:13:51.013
and to go that state you didn't have to work hard

00:13:51.388 --> 00:13:52.992
you didn't have to undergo any hardship

00:13:53.109 --> 00:13:56.309
You didnn't have to pay any money

00:13:56.510 --> 00:14:00.116
The main thing is that God doesn't understand money at all.

00:14:00.242 --> 00:14:02.079
What will He do after taking money?

00:14:02.344 --> 00:14:05.102
What is the need of offering money in His name?

00:14:05.543 --> 00:14:08.179
The person who values money most

00:14:08.258 --> 00:14:10.112
What is the use of giving money to him?

00:14:10.313 --> 00:14:12.147
For example, this land is earth

00:14:12.348 --> 00:14:14.955
put any seed into it, it will sprout on its own.

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:16.787
The same way

00:14:16.988 --> 00:14:22.407
kundalini awakening takes place on its own in a sahaj way

00:14:23.924 --> 00:14:26.106
But such things people explain

00:14:26.307 --> 00:14:31.957
that for kundalini jagran you do this, you do that

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:33.796
you give so much money,do this do that

00:14:33.997 --> 00:14:36.283
it is all false, absolutely false

00:14:36.486 --> 00:14:38.822
Do not trust such people at all

00:14:38.885 --> 00:14:43.105
And those who take money in the name of God, commit sin.

00:14:44.023 --> 00:14:45.592
They commit the greatest sin.

00:14:45.748 --> 00:14:47.910
And those who give, it will be said about you

00:14:48.111 --> 00:14:50.273
that your wisdom will be helpful.

00:14:51.998 --> 00:14:55.045
Another thing is that for this Sahaj

00:14:55.631 --> 00:14:58.349
because as I said that a seed

00:14:58.787 --> 00:15:00.872
by a living process only

00:15:00.994 --> 00:15:04.905
gets germinated, the same way it is a living process

00:15:05.243 --> 00:15:08.219
which is the work of living God.

00:15:08.922 --> 00:15:12.705
To that, even if you make it as per your desire, is not possible

00:15:16.082 --> 00:15:19.247
That sitting inside you is your indivisual mother.

00:15:19.896 --> 00:15:23.668
Kundalini is your mother.Many people have even written that

00:15:23.854 --> 00:15:25.388
that with the awakening of kundalini

00:15:25.589 --> 00:15:27.536
you face this problem, that problem

00:15:27.653 --> 00:15:28.936
I can't understand

00:15:29.137 --> 00:15:31.085
if you don't know anything about a particular field

00:15:31.286 --> 00:15:32.580
then why do you write about it.

00:15:32.897 --> 00:15:35.134
People go on writing to earn any amount of money

00:15:35.461 --> 00:15:36.706
and write such things that people feel scared

00:15:36.907 --> 00:15:38.772
that we will not have  Kundalini awakening

00:15:39.015 --> 00:15:39.932
we will have problems.

00:15:40.132 --> 00:15:41.885
Oh! She is your mother.

00:15:42.041 --> 00:15:44.092
because She is going to give you, your rebirth.

00:15:44.107 --> 00:15:48.267
Your mother who gave you birth, did she not take all the troubles?

00:15:48.371 --> 00:15:50.209
Had she given you any trouble?

00:15:50.583 --> 00:15:52.487
The same way SHe is your mother.

00:15:52.691 --> 00:15:55.185
And this Mother is mother of pure desire.

00:15:55.833 --> 00:15:58.023
If you have pure desire

00:15:58.531 --> 00:16:00.961
that pure desire is in the form of Mother

00:16:01.162 --> 00:16:04.653
is a power and when this power awakens

00:16:04.812 --> 00:16:11.554
then you witness the love of that all pervading power of God

00:16:11.892 --> 00:16:14.485
or we must say that we witness that power.

00:16:15.134 --> 00:16:18.344
That power you can feel inside you

00:16:18.545 --> 00:16:21.196
you can also see it on your head

00:16:21.397 --> 00:16:25.040
that cool breeze is coming out of your head

00:16:25.733 --> 00:16:27.631
as Adi shankaracharya ji has said,"SALEELAM SALEELEM."

00:16:28.359 --> 00:16:30.800
This way you can feel it in fingers as well

00:16:31.001 --> 00:16:32.609
although now a days

00:16:34.155 --> 00:16:38.146
it has opened for the whole world. It was not so earlier.

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:43.567
So, people have not explained it so openly.

00:16:44.149 --> 00:16:48.365
But now it is available for everybody and everybody can get it.

00:16:48.596 --> 00:16:53.103
But in that there are two types of confusions.

00:16:53.294 --> 00:16:55.212
Which is specially in India.

00:16:55.413 --> 00:16:58.981
That is within us there are SUSANSKARS (good as well as)

00:16:59.182 --> 00:17:01.304
KUSANSKARS ( bad, moral and cultural values) .

00:17:01.811 --> 00:17:04.574
Out of those KUSANSKARS, one such is

00:17:04.691 --> 00:17:08.489
that we have got entangled in the bondage of some religious cult.

00:17:09.313 --> 00:17:10.728
To be in Dharma is different from

00:17:10.929 --> 00:17:13.322
being in the bondage of some Dharma.

00:17:14.766 --> 00:17:18.456
To be in Dharma means first that you are your own master.

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:22.985
No need to say follow Dharma or be in Dharma.

00:17:23.015 --> 00:17:26.269
For example, if there is a saint like Tukaram,

00:17:27.309 --> 00:17:29.996
as Namdev was, as was...........Sant Garib Das

00:17:30.584 --> 00:17:32.508
as was Kabir, as Nanaka was

00:17:32.959 --> 00:17:35.815
Had they to be told,"Don't do this wrong act

00:17:36.016 --> 00:17:37.533
don't do this, don't grab money? "

00:17:37.734 --> 00:17:40.385
Had they to be told like that? There was no need of that.

00:17:40.722 --> 00:17:42.529
They would not do wrong acts at all.

00:17:42.672 --> 00:17:46.376
Then they had some such  special personality having their own power.

00:17:46.395 --> 00:17:49.672
on account of which they would not bother for such things

00:17:49.733 --> 00:17:52.478
would condemn such petty issues.

00:17:52.885 --> 00:17:55.290
That thing you are going to get today.

00:17:56.138 --> 00:17:58.277
You can get it today.

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:02.775
So, because the God who has created this universe

00:18:02.976 --> 00:18:08.742
He is eager, He only wants you to get your self realisation.

00:18:09.025 --> 00:18:12.251
Today I  am going to tell you something special

00:18:13.432 --> 00:18:16.792
yesterday was as you know people recognise was a day of Gudi Padwa.

00:18:17.261 --> 00:18:22.971
On the day of Gudi Padwa, people say that Krita yuga started

00:18:23.026 --> 00:18:24.909
Now the people will say, it is all foolishness.

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:27.066
How did krita yuga start?

00:18:27.088 --> 00:18:29.153
Krita yuga started in Kaliyuga

00:18:29.354 --> 00:18:36.963
means that in Kaliyuga this all pervading power of God is working.

00:18:37.362 --> 00:18:40.107
and because of its working only

00:18:40.321 --> 00:18:43.457
today Sahajyoga has become so simple and easy.

00:18:43.658 --> 00:18:46.074
And people have been benifitted in many ways.

00:18:46.324 --> 00:18:48.778
Now if you don't want to take the advantage of it

00:18:48.979 --> 00:18:51.118
no body can compel you.

00:18:51.268 --> 00:18:54.978
So for this,for some days you must have a

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:59.596
hankering, a desire and a little bit of dedication.

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:01.598
because may be you are very egoistic saying

00:19:01.799 --> 00:19:05.120
"We will give you two lakh, you awaken our kundalini"

00:19:05.181 --> 00:19:08.435
Cannot do all, you may give ten lakh, twenty five lakh.

00:19:08.764 --> 00:19:12.025
No problem! If you want your kundalini to be awakened

00:19:12.127 --> 00:19:14.204
then come with humility

00:19:14.595 --> 00:19:17.837
and say that you want your kundalini to be awakened

00:19:17.898 --> 00:19:18.898
It will be instantaneously.

00:19:19.458 --> 00:19:21.936
A person who is full of arrogance

00:19:22.118 --> 00:19:24.692
or a person full of KUSANSKAR (wrong moral values)

00:19:24.755 --> 00:19:28.066
that person finds it difficult in Sahaj yoga

00:19:28.267 --> 00:19:30.394
still I wonder

00:19:30.504 --> 00:19:33.263
that Kundalini's work  is going on so efficiently.

00:19:33.352 --> 00:19:36.399
People are getting benifitted limitlessly that

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:42.058
don't know how God is so merciful to us.

00:19:42.243 --> 00:19:45.674
And many a times we think

00:19:45.875 --> 00:19:49.013
how did He pour His ocean of compassion on us.

00:19:49.234 --> 00:19:52.620
It is worth knowing, It is worth recognising.

00:19:52.821 --> 00:19:55.693
In the modern age people are so much overwhelmed by science

00:19:55.894 --> 00:20:00.392
although in India, the scientists are half baked scientists.

00:20:01.119 --> 00:20:04.377
that is why here people talk more about science.

00:20:04.916 --> 00:20:07.862
So, to this even the scientists

00:20:09.459 --> 00:20:12.876
when they thought that beyound this they don't need anything

00:20:13.999 --> 00:20:16.339
and this science is not the last thing

00:20:16.498 --> 00:20:18.990
there must be definitely something beyond this

00:20:19.302 --> 00:20:22.601
and when they took even one single step of religion

00:20:23.572 --> 00:20:25.695
and God knows how much they progressed

00:20:25.723 --> 00:20:26.931
and I would like to say

00:20:27.132 --> 00:20:31.251
that in America and Russia there are many scientists

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:33.492
who took a big step in Sahaj Yoga

00:20:33.763 --> 00:20:36.003
and they discovered a lot.

00:20:36.343 --> 00:20:38.597
Towards this we should see that

00:20:38.798 --> 00:20:41.777
everything that has proof people ask for.

00:20:41.827 --> 00:20:43.778
Give the proof of this, of that. Why should we give?

00:20:43.979 --> 00:20:45.942
Have we charged any money, any rupee from you?

00:20:46.482 --> 00:20:47.973
What for are you asking?

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:49.723
Of what are you the contractors

00:20:49.924 --> 00:20:51.166
that you ask for the proof of everything?

00:20:51.495 --> 00:20:54.752
First you come and get your realisation.

00:20:55.383 --> 00:20:58.110
But if you want us to give its proof, we won't give.

00:20:58.311 --> 00:20:59.288
Why should we give?

00:20:59.807 --> 00:21:01.602
We are not your servants.

00:21:01.929 --> 00:21:06.052
But when you say ,"Mother please give us self realisation,

00:21:06.253 --> 00:21:08.912
I will be your servant for all times to come".

00:21:09.474 --> 00:21:12.616
Because, there is one bad thing in a human being

00:21:13.382 --> 00:21:15.405
and that is his 'ego".

00:21:15.918 --> 00:21:21.891
its one type of behaviour, which is not liked by Kundalini.

00:21:22.975 --> 00:21:23.953
Kundalini doesn't want

00:21:24.154 --> 00:21:27.734
you to visit and abuse saints in front of them.

00:21:27.967 --> 00:21:30.622
Do you think that kundalini doesn't understand all this?

00:21:30.879 --> 00:21:33.476
This all pervading power is

00:21:33.791 --> 00:21:40.509
this, you don't knowthat it neither thinks, it knows

00:21:40.751 --> 00:21:44.811
not only this, but all this  completely

00:21:44.872 --> 00:21:49.375
organizes, makes everything, carves everything.

00:21:49.446 --> 00:21:52.855
You are unaware that you are living under HER protection.

00:21:52.903 --> 00:21:58.386
That is why this unknown thing is to be revealed to you.

00:21:58.571 --> 00:22:02.607
and it has to be expressed because in this kaliyuga

00:22:02.808 --> 00:22:04.618
you are born in this doubtful state.

00:22:04.767 --> 00:22:08.171
But it is quite possible that you too might have been a

00:22:08.372 --> 00:22:11.836
great saint on the Himalayas, sitting shivering in cold.

00:22:12.339 --> 00:22:15.347
Don't know,  I cannot estimate your virtuousness

00:22:15.548 --> 00:22:19.203
because Sahajyuga is spreading so much that it seems

00:22:19.404 --> 00:22:22.673
all the virtuous people are taking birth in this world.

00:22:22.778 --> 00:22:27.658
You also test your virtuousness fully and get it

00:22:27.859 --> 00:22:30.149
which is a great thing.

00:22:30.457 --> 00:22:33.797
Kundalini awakening, people say is very difficult

00:22:33.998 --> 00:22:36.139
May be for some people

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:39.448
but neither for ME nor for Sahajyoga.

00:22:39.664 --> 00:22:40.664
It is very easy.

00:22:40.908 --> 00:22:43.694
It doesn't cause  any trouble nor any worry.

00:22:43.913 --> 00:22:46.709
This kundalini doesn't pass through seven chakras.

00:22:46.764 --> 00:22:47.764
It passes through six chakras.

00:22:47.794 --> 00:22:50.034
You should know it.

00:22:50.113 --> 00:22:53.243
In many of the books related to kundalini, I was so surprised that

00:22:53.508 --> 00:22:57.288
a German has written a book saying that Kundalini is in our belly.

00:22:57.327 --> 00:23:00.656
some say Kundalini is in brain.

00:23:00.857 --> 00:23:02.396
When you don't know about it

00:23:02.597 --> 00:23:06.616
why do you talk about such a difficult topic?

00:23:07.337 --> 00:23:11.046
How do you say abruptly, this thing is in this, that thing is in that

00:23:11.444 --> 00:23:14.400
the subject about which you don't have any knowledge,

00:23:14.424 --> 00:23:20.135
atleast scientifically you must humbly acquire knowledge

00:23:20.244 --> 00:23:22.796
and after that you must see

00:23:22.997 --> 00:23:25.073
if it is beneficial for the whole humanity

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:27.101
if it is higher than the whole society

00:23:27.302 --> 00:23:30.183
if it is giving rise to a new world

00:23:30.281 --> 00:23:34.072
then why do you put hurdles in that?

00:23:34.367 --> 00:23:37.020
when there is no question of rupee, of no money

00:23:37.054 --> 00:23:39.320
nothing to take, nothing to give

00:23:39.404 --> 00:23:41.360
then why do you put hurdles on it?

00:23:41.479 --> 00:23:43.744
but where there is corruption

00:23:43.945 --> 00:23:47.254
here the people grab money at its peak and make everybody fool

00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:49.466
there nobody will say anything, everybody's mouth is shut.

00:23:49.841 --> 00:23:51.155
let someone stand up and  tell fearlessly

00:23:51.356 --> 00:23:53.785
this man has grabbed so much money by corruption

00:23:53.856 --> 00:23:56.884
gave so much money to MLA (s), to MT(s), nobody will say like that

00:23:57.173 --> 00:23:58.754
Here everybody's [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:59.038 --> 00:24:03.649
But I see that people make tales about  Sahajyoga.

00:24:03.751 --> 00:24:05.293
It has only one reason

00:24:05.494 --> 00:24:09.004
that those who are wicked people at our place

00:24:09.126 --> 00:24:11.556
don't want that any one should be benifitted in the world

00:24:11.711 --> 00:24:12.851
They want

00:24:13.052 --> 00:24:14.957
they want that the world should be such,

00:24:15.158 --> 00:24:19.290
they want the world to become so bad and with that our benifit

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:22.609
but such people are very few.

00:24:22.682 --> 00:24:27.630
Mostly people are very beautiful, very nice but without any support.

00:24:27.888 --> 00:24:31.050
For such people it is necessary that they

00:24:31.251 --> 00:24:33.836
obtain their powers and be collective.

00:24:34.037 --> 00:24:36.462
When they will be collective, then only

00:24:36.663 --> 00:24:39.088
these wicked trends will be destroyed from the world.

00:24:39.338 --> 00:24:42.739
And whatever are their after effects because of them

00:24:42.795 --> 00:24:45.549
whatever our problems are will come to an end.

00:24:45.643 --> 00:24:51.473
This will be in your social and political regions but

00:24:52.376 --> 00:24:55.118
there will be a great revolution inside ourselves

00:24:55.447 --> 00:24:58.575
It is non controvertial that in sahajyoga people will get alright.

00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:00.224
There is no doubt about it.

00:25:00.425 --> 00:25:02.913
We can tell you that there are such people in Bombay

00:25:03.114 --> 00:25:05.980
who had blood cancer and now they are alright.

00:25:06.871 --> 00:25:08.670
and they are alright till now.

00:25:08.772 --> 00:25:11.783
Years have passed , they are alright and they will be so.

00:25:12.025 --> 00:25:15.886
But there is one thing, that if there is a rich man

00:25:16.117 --> 00:25:18.879
He will say, "No Mother you only have to treat me"

00:25:19.941 --> 00:25:23.595
Okay! once I may give him time, but I don't have so much of time.

00:25:24.422 --> 00:25:26.360
Then you will get cured of one disease

00:25:26.562 --> 00:25:28.048
Why can't another disease attack you?

00:25:28.815 --> 00:25:32.048
The reason is that completely in totality

00:25:32.116 --> 00:25:34.299
you have to get cured.

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:37.394
For getting cured perfectly, what should you do?

00:25:37.648 --> 00:25:41.133
For that you should be totally in sahajyoga .

00:25:41.712 --> 00:25:44.798
Because there is depth in you, a lot of depth

00:25:44.876 --> 00:25:49.029
very sweetness, very beautiful, an ocean of joy

00:25:49.302 --> 00:25:52.149
but till you do not get it,

00:25:52.259 --> 00:25:54.401
till you do not take a dip into it,

00:25:54.602 --> 00:25:57.540
till then you will be attacked repeatedly.

00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:01.187
May be these are health related, or mental or intellectual or may be

00:26:03.731 --> 00:26:05.312
spiritual as well.

00:26:06.216 --> 00:26:09.499
To think about these things, a man must think

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:12.388
that if we are getting realisation in Sahajyoga today

00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:14.291
and if we are getting this power

00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:19.844
it is very important that we use this power in such a way that

00:26:19.914 --> 00:26:23.355
we touch its depth, which is our property.

00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:27.181
That is special quality within us, let us distribute it.

00:26:27.318 --> 00:26:30.559
And for that it is such a great thing here that we

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:33.869
in Mumbai have twenty five to thirty centers.

00:26:34.593 --> 00:26:36.443
And you go there and ask

00:26:36.644 --> 00:26:38.359
then whether you are very affulent

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:41.322
or a great man or a man of low category, it doesn't matter.

00:26:41.457 --> 00:26:44.547
Because we are not doing any bussiness out of it

00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:48.294
We don't have luxurious palaces and things like that.

00:26:48.783 --> 00:26:53.320
We have all ordinary things and people can go and learn.

00:26:53.647 --> 00:26:54.929
We should not think

00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:58.343
"I am king of some place, how can I come?"

00:26:58.932 --> 00:27:00.196
About this Mohammed Sahib has said

00:27:00.397 --> 00:27:03.013
"He may be a king or a pauper, everybody has to sit on one level".

00:27:03.067 --> 00:27:06.689
That is everybody is in front of God.

00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:09.751
After going there one who meditates

00:27:09.836 --> 00:27:11.621
and continue with his own depth

00:27:11.651 --> 00:27:14.764
and after that He won't have any problem.

00:27:15.131 --> 00:27:17.142
And he himself becomes powerful.

00:27:17.263 --> 00:27:19.527
There are some such people with us, you will be surprised

00:27:19.654 --> 00:27:22.493
very ordinary people who have average education

00:27:22.847 --> 00:27:25.951
they have acquired such powers

00:27:26.239 --> 00:27:28.615
that they can cure every type of disease

00:27:28.816 --> 00:27:32.011
they can cure all types of mental diseases

00:27:32.178 --> 00:27:35.283
and not only this, they are very simple people

00:27:35.399 --> 00:27:37.285
and no KOWDI, no money, nothing

00:27:37.336 --> 00:27:39.867
if we have to go somewhere, recently we had to go to Calcutta

00:27:40.039 --> 00:27:41.604
there one person was treated.

00:27:42.301 --> 00:27:45.234
This way everyone can get this power.

00:27:45.591 --> 00:27:48.110
Not only this, you see your chidren are singing

00:27:48.228 --> 00:27:49.591
These are Indian children who are singing

00:27:49.792 --> 00:27:50.799
there is nothing special about it.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.419
And if you see, the song that was of Maha Laxmi

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:56.155
is in Sanskrit language

00:27:56.240 --> 00:28:00.416
but it has been sung by Swiss Sahajyogis and they sing so nicely.

00:28:00.617 --> 00:28:04.642
Those for whom to speak even a single word of Hindi

00:28:04.843 --> 00:28:05.925
would be a problem

00:28:06.126 --> 00:28:08.796
have sung this song so beautifully in Sanskrit.

00:28:08.977 --> 00:28:12.835
They will sing in Marathi, in Hindi and our Indians also

00:28:13.035 --> 00:28:16.744
have done everything in English, French and German.

00:28:17.015 --> 00:28:19.095
This capability that human being has acquired

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:20.940
and with this capability human beings

00:28:21.077 --> 00:28:22.502
became a special human being

00:28:22.781 --> 00:28:25.940
One can say has reached the state of superman.

00:28:26.027 --> 00:28:27.632
so sober

00:28:28.222 --> 00:28:35.862
so loving, so compassionate, so merciful and so much joy giving

00:28:36.014 --> 00:28:38.455
becomes such a large heart

00:28:39.058 --> 00:28:40.658
because it is a VISHWA DHARMA (universal religion).

00:28:40.927 --> 00:28:43.086
All the religions are vested in it

00:28:43.462 --> 00:28:46.112
No religion is left behind from it, if it is a real religion

00:28:46.234 --> 00:28:47.526
All the religions are included in it

00:28:47.542 --> 00:28:48.818
what is its value?

00:28:48.904 --> 00:28:50.081
All of them are incarnations

00:28:50.175 --> 00:28:51.858
AAPPKE PRASHIT HAI..............

00:28:51.914 --> 00:28:56.070
Apart from that  all your saints and sages

00:28:56.111 --> 00:28:59.520
Where are they? what is their status? you have all that knowledge...

00:29:00.009 --> 00:29:05.017
The greatest thing is that it is your heritage.

00:29:05.964 --> 00:29:11.172
It is the heritage of your country, it is the heritage of India.

00:29:11.299 --> 00:29:14.540
It is your heritage. This heritage is yours.

00:29:14.822 --> 00:29:18.635
And you remained hidden from it, because Britishers ruled over you.

00:29:18.729 --> 00:29:21.423
and after that what happened, God save from that.

00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:24.922
I was with Gandhiji when I was seven years old

00:29:25.123 --> 00:29:27.560
Gandhiji was a self realised soul

00:29:27.998 --> 00:29:33.295
and He used to tell Me that when our country will be independent

00:29:33.403 --> 00:29:35.740
then you should start your Sahajyoga, not before that.

00:29:36.014 --> 00:29:39.372
I said ,"I have not known yet what a human being is.

00:29:39.573 --> 00:29:40.778
He has to go further.

00:29:40.979 --> 00:29:42.466
How can something be done?"

00:29:42.892 --> 00:29:47.109
He would say, till we do not become independent

00:29:47.342 --> 00:29:49.276
till then how can we know SAV KA TANTRA (self's mechanism )

00:29:49.454 --> 00:29:50.810
He said, that is absolutely right.

00:29:51.011 --> 00:29:54.983
Till we do not become independent, we cannot know SAV KA TANTRA

00:29:55.413 --> 00:29:58.709
But at that time, if Gandhiji had started it really

00:29:58.992 --> 00:30:02.337
Even now I think, if this self study had been started that time

00:30:02.538 --> 00:30:06.007
We would not have faced the plight , we are facing today.

00:30:07.067 --> 00:30:09.379
The reason of our plight today is that

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:12.107
we don't pay attention to ADHYATM (self study)

00:30:12.239 --> 00:30:14.082
Why doesn't it come to our mind?

00:30:14.125 --> 00:30:15.909
Although you may do anything

00:30:15.972 --> 00:30:21.238
Untill you get your ADHYATM, you cannot live peacefully.

00:30:22.572 --> 00:30:24.506
This is God's Divine bond.

00:30:24.707 --> 00:30:31.947
You need money, take it. You need children, have it

00:30:32.328 --> 00:30:35.292
You want power, have power and get shoe beating from him.

00:30:35.964 --> 00:30:38.551
And you want anything VIP,

00:30:38.752 --> 00:30:42.621
get it and you will realise that there is no joy in it.

00:30:42.687 --> 00:30:47.228
You know the law of Economics, that anything

00:30:48.107 --> 00:30:52.399
you like and get it after hard work and after that

00:30:52.436 --> 00:30:54.109
after that the joy of getting it is over.

00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:56.691
After getting it, you want a new thing.

00:30:56.993 --> 00:31:00.406
It means that in general it is not satiable.

00:31:00.618 --> 00:31:05.587
A man's desires are never completely satiated.

00:31:06.405 --> 00:31:11.177
Same thing our desires within our being, which never get satiated

00:31:11.231 --> 00:31:14.627
So there is definitely some desire which will satiate us.

00:31:14.765 --> 00:31:18.198
And that desire is pure desire which we call Kundalini.

00:31:18.362 --> 00:31:20.467
We should acquire this kundalini

00:31:20.668 --> 00:31:23.585
From this we should know what we are.

00:31:24.464 --> 00:31:27.788
What is our speciality? Why are we in this world?

00:31:29.599 --> 00:31:33.001
Until our connection is with that Divine Power

00:31:33.211 --> 00:31:34.589
till then we cannot know.

00:31:34.790 --> 00:31:37.929
[INAUDIBLE] or we are in our ego

00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:41.331
we cannot know  properly what is the real problem.

00:31:42.217 --> 00:31:45.236
Grand, dignified person

00:31:45.647 --> 00:31:47.502
today we need such a person

00:31:47.628 --> 00:31:49.382
who is great

00:31:49.638 --> 00:31:54.565
and the one who has within him his self respect.

00:31:54.699 --> 00:31:56.279
that in comparison to that self respect

00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:58.207
considers filthy  things filthy.

00:31:58.545 --> 00:32:02.510
But this religion awakening should be from within not externally.

00:32:02.697 --> 00:32:04.903
When a man gets awakened in this religion

00:32:04.982 --> 00:32:07.290
then he gives up all the ADHARMAS (unrightuous).

00:32:07.491 --> 00:32:08.902
These  are left out on their own.

00:32:09.312 --> 00:32:10.966
As I gave you the example

00:32:11.167 --> 00:32:13.807
these saints didn't need any one to tell them

00:32:13.835 --> 00:32:15.513
They were DHARMIC by birth.

00:32:15.966 --> 00:32:18.178
This DHARMA should awaken within you

00:32:18.222 --> 00:32:19.957
and for that there should be kundalini awakening.

00:32:20.158 --> 00:32:23.195
I cannot show you where DHARMA is in front of so many people but

00:32:23.396 --> 00:32:26.058
where you can see a big green circle, there is your DHARMA.

00:32:26.259 --> 00:32:28.999
We will awaken that DHARMA

00:32:30.256 --> 00:32:34.298
then even if we desire we cannot do ADHARMA.

00:32:34.873 --> 00:32:37.303
Even if we want , we cannot do wrong things

00:32:37.512 --> 00:32:39.556
because, the moment we do something wrong

00:32:39.757 --> 00:32:41.843
this chaitanya will depart from us and we will be away from joy.

00:32:42.044 --> 00:32:44.266
so, leave it, we have nothing to do with it.

00:32:44.482 --> 00:32:50.209
This is not for a group not for one  country

00:32:50.654 --> 00:32:55.766
not for any particular type of people, it is for the whole world.

00:32:56.629 --> 00:32:58.775
and the whole world has to get it.

00:32:58.957 --> 00:33:01.300
There have been many prophesies about it

00:33:01.431 --> 00:33:04.793
and people have said that it is going to happen.

00:33:05.076 --> 00:33:09.399
But towards this, you should think a little bit that

00:33:09.412 --> 00:33:12.298
i too am a seeker

00:33:12.672 --> 00:33:14.917
and it is necessary for a seeker

00:33:15.011 --> 00:33:19.461
that he thinks that whatever he will get, that he will know

00:33:19.474 --> 00:33:20.824
and i will go deep into it.

00:33:20.954 --> 00:33:22.984
Many people get realisation in Sahajyoga.

00:33:23.185 --> 00:33:24.888
Today also you see many people may get realisation

00:33:24.945 --> 00:33:27.052
but there are very few people who go deep into it.

00:33:27.274 --> 00:33:29.457
and this is what troubles ME.

00:33:29.529 --> 00:33:31.080
Here there are not deep people.

00:33:31.244 --> 00:33:33.639
It is just the reverse topic in the universe

00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:36.078
Here people once get realisation, get settled into it.

00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:40.210
Out of them, barely one or two will be useless

00:33:40.613 --> 00:33:42.849
but in our country the reason is that

00:33:43.897 --> 00:33:50.177
we have so many ideals, such great incarnations have been here

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:51.735
we don't respect ourselves.

00:33:51.936 --> 00:33:55.225
We have one Guru, he is Guru Maharaj we consider him as our Guru.

00:33:55.259 --> 00:33:57.168
What about you?

00:33:57.198 --> 00:33:58.634
What gravity you have acquired?

00:33:58.682 --> 00:34:02.163
We adore Rama, we adore Hanumana, we adore Mohammad.

00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:05.099
But have you been benefitted by that?

00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:06.284
Why do you accept THEM?

00:34:06.346 --> 00:34:08.373
Your yourself become worthy of admiration.

00:34:08.514 --> 00:34:13.216
And this is possible when their qualities will awaken within you.

00:34:13.697 --> 00:34:16.575
Sahajyoga awakens that very quality in them.

00:34:17.359 --> 00:34:21.276
That is why I want to tell you only one thing,

00:34:21.697 --> 00:34:23.576
that there should be truthfulness in it.

00:34:24.430 --> 00:34:26.909
and if you ask for it humbly

00:34:27.081 --> 00:34:28.819
you will get it surely.

00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:31.213
You can get it surely.

00:34:31.477 --> 00:34:35.890
So, in MY opinion tomorrow I will tell you specially about it.

00:34:36.029 --> 00:34:40.457
because, you will get books about kundalini, you should read.

00:34:40.653 --> 00:34:43.930
I only want that your inner light may enlighten.

00:34:44.636 --> 00:34:48.128
After that, what is this Atma? I will tell you about that tomorrow.

00:34:48.926 --> 00:34:51.586
I hope that from today you will understand

00:34:51.693 --> 00:34:54.144
You are not what you think of yourself.

00:34:54.345 --> 00:34:56.182
You are much greater than that

00:34:56.199 --> 00:34:59.468
and you don't have to get it, you have only to know it.

00:34:59.917 --> 00:35:01.934
MY blessings to you!

00:35:06.432 --> 00:35:09.810
Those who have to out for five to ten minutes

00:35:10.019 --> 00:35:11.019
they may go and come back.

00:35:11.289 --> 00:35:15.297
It will take ten minutes for your self realisation..........

00:35:15.535 --> 00:35:18.968
and so much for this Mother Earth and now

00:35:19.474 --> 00:35:21.236
for your ownself and for others.

00:35:21.448 --> 00:35:25.463
Tell them, those who want to go out can go for five to ten minutes

00:35:25.664 --> 00:35:27.161
and then sit comfortably.

00:35:39.433 --> 00:35:45.539
As we must have respect of ourselves, because we are human beings.

00:35:46.282 --> 00:35:49.691
Here in lies the epitomy of evolution.

00:35:56.566 --> 00:36:02.754
All should have one's self-respect and that we

00:36:03.645 --> 00:36:08.974
are born as human beings and human being is on top of evolution

00:36:09.688 --> 00:36:11.871
and for himself, Human being

00:36:13.352 --> 00:36:16.785
should never underestimate himself, that is the first condition

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:21.594
This is the first condition that you have to respect yourself.

00:36:24.621 --> 00:36:26.347
you must have complete self confidence about yourself.

00:36:31.875 --> 00:36:36.889
We should have complete self confidence about ourselves

00:36:39.448 --> 00:36:40.842
and we should know

00:36:41.619 --> 00:36:43.487
That those who tell us

00:36:43.688 --> 00:36:47.598
that you have done this sin and that sin, they speak like that

00:36:47.637 --> 00:36:50.492
all these people

00:36:50.529 --> 00:36:53.939
are themselves sinners.

00:36:54.836 --> 00:36:57.457
Because you are human beings and every human being

00:36:58.918 --> 00:37:02.313
can make some or the other mistake. He is not a God.

00:37:03.324 --> 00:37:06.192
So, towards oneself, in a way

00:37:06.393 --> 00:37:10.011
there should be respect and self respect.

00:37:11.858 --> 00:37:16.056
This is the first condition for you.

00:37:20.148 --> 00:37:22.690
After all you are not God.

00:37:23.233 --> 00:37:25.635
You can make mistakes, doesn't matter.

00:37:25.833 --> 00:37:27.821
Those who tell you that you are sinners

00:37:28.198 --> 00:37:29.981
Please remember, they must be the greatest sinners.

00:37:30.616 --> 00:37:34.515
Nobody has bussiness to say like that to any human being.

00:37:35.651 --> 00:37:39.907
So all of you should have complete regard and respect for your being.

00:37:40.845 --> 00:37:41.845
I have no fear.

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:48.078
And one should never under-estimate himself

00:37:49.072 --> 00:37:52.077
I am like this, I am like that

00:37:52.278 --> 00:37:53.860
we have always heard that

00:37:54.702 --> 00:37:57.715
and those who tell that are them selves sinners that we should know

00:37:57.916 --> 00:38:01.140
and for oneself never have feeling of inferiority

00:38:01.376 --> 00:38:05.402
if you were God it would be a different thing

00:38:05.603 --> 00:38:08.623
but you are human beings.

00:38:08.824 --> 00:38:14.259
And human beings will make some or the other mistakes.

00:38:14.614 --> 00:38:18.838
And so I request not to have any low feelings.

00:38:19.096 --> 00:38:22.443
This is my sincere request to you

00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:27.383
And that now you have to enter into in the kingdom of God.

00:38:27.957 --> 00:38:29.750
Be Joyful about yourself.

00:38:31.418 --> 00:38:32.418
You should be very

00:38:35.251 --> 00:38:36.565
happy about yourself

00:38:37.175 --> 00:38:38.939
very much pleased about yourself.

00:38:42.941 --> 00:38:46.257
You sit in a very pleased state within yourself.

00:38:47.649 --> 00:38:50.671
There is no need to degrade yourself down.

00:38:53.207 --> 00:38:55.093
And second condition is

00:38:55.622 --> 00:38:58.087
that you forgive everyone

00:38:58.154 --> 00:39:00.080
you

00:39:00.521 --> 00:39:03.750
forgive everyone. You do not do anything

00:39:03.836 --> 00:39:07.837
But if you do not forgive then

00:39:08.863 --> 00:39:13.081
you are playing in the hands of those who will hurt you

00:39:14.406 --> 00:39:16.943
[Marathi]

00:39:17.144 --> 00:39:20.976
so I request you to forgive everyone altogether.

00:39:21.541 --> 00:39:24.220
and don't think, to forgive someone and not to forgive others

00:39:24.776 --> 00:39:26.548
Forgive all of them

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:33.400
With that

00:39:35.736 --> 00:39:41.932
one thing is that you have to forgive everyone together.

00:39:42.536 --> 00:39:45.033
You may forgive or may not,

00:39:45.905 --> 00:39:48.448
but you don't do anything.

00:39:49.042 --> 00:39:50.280
It is all false

00:39:50.481 --> 00:39:52.675
and once you

00:39:52.770 --> 00:39:54.469
don't forgive anyone,

00:39:54.753 --> 00:39:58.830
then you play into the hands of those who want to tease you.

00:39:59.064 --> 00:40:02.330
So, altogether, without remembering whom you have to forgive

00:40:02.531 --> 00:40:04.045
say together in your heart

00:40:04.246 --> 00:40:06.499
I forgive completely.

00:40:08.132 --> 00:40:12.964
Thes second condition is to completely forgive

00:40:13.051 --> 00:40:16.715
everyone altogether not to the member

00:40:16.885 --> 00:40:19.303
individually in person but

00:40:19.536 --> 00:40:22.004
in a general way just forgive.

00:40:22.747 --> 00:40:26.264
Whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything.

00:40:26.816 --> 00:40:31.026
But if you do not forgive then you play into wrong hands.

00:40:31.455 --> 00:40:35.878
So it is a myth, and so please don't torture yourself with the myth.

00:40:36.183 --> 00:40:38.756
Please forgive everyone

00:40:38.942 --> 00:40:41.274
without thinking individually about anyone.

00:40:41.402 --> 00:40:44.156
In a general way, just say , i forgive everyone.

00:40:45.406 --> 00:40:47.107
These are the two conditions.

00:40:55.849 --> 00:40:57.585
Take out your shoes.

00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:00.460
Please take out your shoes.

00:41:01.381 --> 00:41:04.677
remove your shoes on one side

00:41:05.084 --> 00:41:06.591
and those who are sitting on ground

00:41:09.734 --> 00:41:10.734
not for them

00:41:14.576 --> 00:41:16.583
[Marathi]

00:41:17.288 --> 00:41:19.132
[Marathi]

00:41:22.029 --> 00:41:24.934
[Marathi]

00:41:26.246 --> 00:41:29.097
[Marathi]

00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:33.249
[Marathi]

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:35.272
[Marathi]

00:41:36.226 --> 00:41:38.217
[Marathi]

00:41:38.413 --> 00:41:41.051
Please keep your feet apart from each other.

00:41:41.130 --> 00:41:44.362
Those who are sitting on the chair, can remove their shoes.

00:41:45.548 --> 00:41:50.247
Those who are sitting on the chair, keep their feet apart

00:41:50.341 --> 00:41:51.844
and remove their shoes.

00:42:06.313 --> 00:42:07.845
Now put your both the hands

00:42:08.663 --> 00:42:11.073
like this. Take out your shoes.

00:42:11.322 --> 00:42:12.322
[Marathi]

00:42:14.197 --> 00:42:15.974
[Marathi]

00:42:22.551 --> 00:42:23.878
Both the hands towards ME.

00:42:41.775 --> 00:42:42.775
[Marathi]

00:42:44.087 --> 00:42:45.087
[Marathi]

00:42:45.877 --> 00:42:46.877
[Marathi]

00:42:47.159 --> 00:42:49.632

00:42:50.647 --> 00:42:52.055
Please put your left hand towards ME

00:42:52.256 --> 00:42:54.146

Keep left hand towards ME and right hand on Mother Earth.

00:43:05.057 --> 00:43:08.072
or towards Mother Earth if you are sitting in a chair.

00:43:23.472 --> 00:43:26.163
Now right hand towards ME.

00:43:26.256 --> 00:43:28.343
Put right hand towards ME

00:43:29.242 --> 00:43:31.168
and the left hand towards the sky.

00:43:34.041 --> 00:43:36.248
Tomorrow I will tell you why I did so.

00:43:36.352 --> 00:43:40.462
[Marathi]

00:43:40.516 --> 00:43:43.449
[Marathi]

00:43:44.546 --> 00:43:45.546
[Marathi]

00:43:48.201 --> 00:43:49.201
[Marathi]

00:43:57.191 --> 00:44:00.432
[Marathi]

00:44:04.022 --> 00:44:11.557
why?

00:44:20.306 --> 00:44:24.538
[Marathi]

00:44:25.699 --> 00:44:29.117
Put both the hands towards the sky.

00:44:29.155 --> 00:44:30.815
[Marathi]

00:44:31.016 --> 00:44:34.247
Push back your head

00:44:34.381 --> 00:44:35.381
[Marathi]

00:44:35.749 --> 00:44:38.245
[Marathi]

00:44:40.146 --> 00:44:43.592
Now, just ask a question

00:44:46.983 --> 00:44:50.139
Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?

00:44:50.789 --> 00:44:52.050
Or ask the question,

00:44:52.251 --> 00:44:57.112
Mother,"Is this the cool breeze of the all pervading power of God?"

00:44:58.544 --> 00:45:00.642
Put a question, is this

00:45:02.004 --> 00:45:05.643

00:45:17.244 --> 00:45:18.244
Ask in your heart.

00:45:19.719 --> 00:45:22.470
Ask three times, three times

00:45:28.752 --> 00:45:30.005
[Marathi]

00:45:33.355 --> 00:45:35.560
[Marathi]

00:45:36.193 --> 00:45:39.438
The trees are not moving, they are just still.

00:45:39.583 --> 00:45:41.801
but you feel the cool breeze in your hands.

00:45:48.347 --> 00:45:50.281
and watch Me without thinking.

00:45:51.003 --> 00:45:53.003

00:45:53.523 --> 00:45:54.523
[Marathi]

00:45:55.415 --> 00:45:57.925
The trees are not moving, the leaves are not moving.

00:45:58.331 --> 00:46:00.444
means coolness will be in your hands.

00:46:05.374 --> 00:46:07.527
Now put your right hand towards ME.

00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:10.750

and bend your head

00:46:17.696 --> 00:46:20.159
and see for yourself from the fontenal bone area

00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:22.934
if you are getting cool breeze from the other side.

00:46:23.297 --> 00:46:25.853
[Marathi]

00:46:27.481 --> 00:46:30.584
Don't put your hand on the top of your head, away from it.

00:46:30.848 --> 00:46:32.518
[Marathi]

00:46:32.995 --> 00:46:36.236

00:46:36.318 --> 00:46:39.126

00:46:39.327 --> 00:46:41.089
some people take it much further

00:46:42.076 --> 00:46:44.293
some people feel at a higher level

00:46:44.684 --> 00:46:46.186
and some very close

00:46:50.457 --> 00:46:53.734
put the left hand towards ME.

00:46:55.116 --> 00:46:57.666
Don't doubt. Don't doubt yourself.

00:46:59.174 --> 00:47:01.099
Now put down your head again.

00:47:01.243 --> 00:47:02.997
and see with your right hand.

00:47:03.225 --> 00:47:05.647
There is a cool breeze on the top of your head.

00:47:13.590 --> 00:47:17.341
Now see, cool breeze will come from your  Fontanelle bone.

00:47:18.279 --> 00:47:20.953
[Marathi]

00:47:21.279 --> 00:47:24.020

00:47:28.090 --> 00:47:30.792
[Marathi]

00:47:30.869 --> 00:47:32.691
Some people might feel hot.

00:47:32.892 --> 00:47:35.709
Heat coming out.

00:47:35.932 --> 00:47:38.100

00:47:54.629 --> 00:47:56.389
Keep your hand away

Again please bend your head and watch

00:47:59.918 --> 00:48:03.344

00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:07.628
left hand on the head and right hand towards ME.

00:48:09.807 --> 00:48:10.807
............

00:48:12.478 --> 00:48:13.478
ok

00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:16.795
Now put your both the hands like this

00:48:17.817 --> 00:48:19.409
You have become too much thoughtless

00:48:20.041 --> 00:48:20.707
no thoughts

00:48:22.879 --> 00:48:23.879
Nirvichar

00:48:31.431 --> 00:48:33.645
Those in whose hands

00:48:33.846 --> 00:48:36.854
now you see, not even a single tree is moving

00:48:37.373 --> 00:48:38.505
not even a single leaf is moving

00:48:38.547 --> 00:48:40.623
everything you are seeing yourself, nothing such

00:48:40.965 --> 00:48:43.841
You are seeing yourself, you are witness to it

00:48:43.991 --> 00:48:47.346
Not a single leaf is moving, they are all witnessing you

00:48:47.657 --> 00:48:50.558
All these trees are witnessing, what is happening to you.

00:48:53.929 --> 00:48:56.728
Only this has been a great country.

00:48:57.157 --> 00:48:58.157
Now

00:48:58.883 --> 00:49:02.254
Those who have felt cool breeze in their hands

00:49:02.903 --> 00:49:06.149
Those who have felt cool breeze in their hands

00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:12.369
Those who felt cool breeze

00:49:13.218 --> 00:49:17.346
or they have felt it through their Fontanelle bone area

00:49:19.135 --> 00:49:22.013
Those who felt cool breeze on their Fontanelle bone area

00:49:23.052 --> 00:49:25.544
Those who felt cool breeze on their Fontanelle bone area

00:49:30.644 --> 00:49:33.057
All those who felt

00:49:33.167 --> 00:49:36.612
put their both the hands like this

00:49:36.664 --> 00:49:39.656
please raise your both the hands, those who have felt it.

00:49:51.454 --> 00:49:53.473
All of you are now saints

00:49:54.131 --> 00:49:55.921
My blessings to you!

00:49:57.891 --> 00:50:01.167
Now you respect your Atma Sakhshatkar.

00:50:01.398 --> 00:50:03.478
You must respect your self realisation.

00:50:04.068 --> 00:50:06.345
What you have got , what you have felt

00:50:07.263 --> 00:50:09.040
and what you have enjoyed

00:50:10.293 --> 00:50:13.305
you must know what is this power and how to use it.

00:50:13.779 --> 00:50:14.779
How to work it out?

00:50:15.515 --> 00:50:18.174
And now you have become authority with this power.

00:50:19.347 --> 00:50:24.779
So please, remember that now you have to move

00:50:25.467 --> 00:50:27.837
deeper and deeper into your own being.

00:50:28.425 --> 00:50:30.085
Whatever you are now,

00:50:30.985 --> 00:50:33.949
I won't say that you have now become Sahaj yogis

00:50:34.339 --> 00:50:38.661
yes, your kundalini has been awakened.

00:50:38.777 --> 00:50:40.168
There is no doubt about it

00:50:40.497 --> 00:50:42.766
but only after going completely to the depth of it

00:50:42.967 --> 00:50:44.748
you can become a Sahaj yogi.

00:50:45.158 --> 00:50:47.272
It should be decided  a bit

00:50:47.473 --> 00:50:50.951
that you go into your depth and get it.

00:50:51.692 --> 00:50:56.945
That is your power, your property and is your dignity.

00:50:57.146 --> 00:50:58.886
It is a matter of great pleasure

00:50:59.087 --> 00:51:02.070
that all of you have got your realisation.

00:51:02.929 --> 00:51:04.436
It is a matter of great pleasure that

00:51:04.637 --> 00:51:05.905
all of you have got realisation.

00:51:06.435 --> 00:51:09.071
Self realisation has begun for everyone.

00:51:09.551 --> 00:51:11.229
But unless and until you

00:51:11.762 --> 00:51:13.958
go deeper

00:51:14.754 --> 00:51:15.754
till then

00:51:17.636 --> 00:51:20.163
You cannot be called a Sahajyogi.

00:51:20.413 --> 00:51:22.627
And till you are not gone deeper, there will

00:51:22.828 --> 00:51:24.792
be always some kind of problem lingering on.

00:51:25.007 --> 00:51:29.978
Please go to our centers and go deeper.

00:51:30.392 --> 00:51:31.625
Tomorrow again

00:51:32.016 --> 00:51:35.470
I am available at your service and

00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:38.904
tomorrow I will talk about Spirit.

00:51:39.420 --> 00:51:42.107
So tomorrow everyone please be present here.

00:51:42.514 --> 00:51:46.610
and share with everyone, that it is a very simple thing.

00:51:46.829 --> 00:51:48.788
Within five minutes i got my self realisation.

00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:51.563
They won't believe it. Ask them to come and see it.

00:51:51.694 --> 00:51:55.694
Now you will be able to sleep very well.

00:51:58.672 --> 00:52:01.226
And everything has worked out very well very well.

00:52:01.522 --> 00:52:03.734
You have to experience

00:52:04.273 --> 00:52:06.268
Now the benefit of it

00:52:06.554 --> 00:52:09.065
only by using this power

00:52:09.177 --> 00:52:13.008
and  also by going deeper into your routine

00:52:13.057 --> 00:52:17.851
you become really, absolutely an authority of Sahajyoga.

00:52:18.430 --> 00:52:19.937
I wish you all good luck!
