Shri Krishna Puja Talk
Cabella Ligure, Italy

2
00:00:01,754 --> 00:00:02,754
August 16, 1998

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:08,950
Today we are going to have Shri Krishna Puja.

4
00:00:09,314 --> 00:00:29,344
It is a very important thing about the power
of Shri Krishna that gives you a witness state.

5
00:00:29,344 --> 00:00:45,664
This is very important also because, in these
days of Kali Yuga and complete confusion of

6
00:00:45,664 --> 00:01:05,405
value system, all kinds of turmoil makes a
very complex conditions to exist.

7
00:01:05,405 --> 00:01:21,865
The state of witnessing is only possible through
meditation: you reach the state of thoughtless

8
00:01:21,865 --> 00:01:22,865
awareness.

9
00:01:22,865 --> 00:01:27,424
It’s combined together.

10
00:01:27,424 --> 00:01:34,845
Now the witness state is such a state where
you just do not react.

11
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:47,244
If you react, then the problem starts.

12
00:01:47,244 --> 00:02:02,785
It’s a very simple thing to understand that
we react through our ego or through our conditioning.

13
00:02:02,785 --> 00:02:14,475
Otherwise there is no way to react.

14
00:02:14,475 --> 00:02:18,995
Anything, now for example there is a beautiful
carpet here.

15
00:02:18,995 --> 00:02:33,095
As soon as I look at it, if I use My ego I’ll
start thinking, “Now from where did they

16
00:02:33,095 --> 00:02:34,865
get it?

17
00:02:34,865 --> 00:02:39,285
How much they paid it?”

18
00:02:39,285 --> 00:02:43,365
This is the first reaction.

19
00:02:43,365 --> 00:02:47,075
Then you can even go further with it, anger
can come in, “Why did they bring such a

20
00:02:47,075 --> 00:02:48,495
nice carpet?

21
00:02:48,495 --> 00:02:54,175
What was the need to put it here?”

22
00:02:54,175 --> 00:03:00,225
It goes on like that, one after another.

23
00:03:00,225 --> 00:03:07,735
Now in My conditioning if I see these things,
I would say that “This color is not suited

24
00:03:07,735 --> 00:03:17,585
for Krishna Puja, they should have had another
color for this Krishna Puja.”

25
00:03:17,585 --> 00:03:23,445
So this kind goes on from one to another,
to another.

26
00:03:23,445 --> 00:03:29,525
But that means this conditioning is built
up within us.

27
00:03:29,525 --> 00:03:37,795
All our problems of our conditioning are really
horrible.

28
00:03:37,795 --> 00:03:41,335
For example, racialism.

29
00:03:41,335 --> 00:03:43,315
We have racialism.

30
00:03:43,315 --> 00:03:57,605
In America it’s very much more, you can
feel it though they don’t say; but if you

31
00:03:57,605 --> 00:04:05,065
go, say, from Italy you feel it, if you go
from India also you can feel it.

32
00:04:05,065 --> 00:04:10,385
Now why this racialism is there?

33
00:04:10,385 --> 00:04:13,075
What is the reason?

34
00:04:13,075 --> 00:04:29,155
Why do we react to this kind of horrible hatred
for another community or another color which

35
00:04:29,155 --> 00:04:34,535
is only skin-deep?

36
00:04:34,535 --> 00:04:42,795
Now with rationality you might be able to
explain, “O God, these people, they are

37
00:04:42,795 --> 00:04:52,945
absolutely useless,” or “They have come
to our country and are just troubling us.”

38
00:04:52,945 --> 00:04:56,075
All these conditionings are there.

39
00:04:56,075 --> 00:05:03,775
But if you see when they talk of immigrants,
the Americans must know they are immigrants,

40
00:05:03,775 --> 00:05:05,255
all of them.

41
00:05:05,255 --> 00:05:09,765
America never was their country.

42
00:05:09,765 --> 00:05:16,005
And they threw away all the other Red Indians,
took away their land and very nicely they

43
00:05:16,005 --> 00:05:18,545
are governors of America.

44
00:05:18,545 --> 00:05:31,225
But the reaction is, “Those who are not
white complexion, they are all to be condemned,

45
00:05:31,225 --> 00:05:32,415
tortured.”

46
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:42,185
Now if they are by nature violent, then also
this conditioning of violence comes in.

47
00:05:42,185 --> 00:05:46,315
Then they start killing each other.

48
00:05:46,315 --> 00:05:56,385
They have killed ruthlessly so many people,
thinking that they have a right to go into

49
00:05:56,385 --> 00:06:05,835
any country and kill everyone and take the
land that is not their own.

50
00:06:05,835 --> 00:06:10,275
Actually, land doesn’t belong to anybody
as such.

51
00:06:10,275 --> 00:06:18,095
But nobody has a right to go to some land
and try to occupy it, and throw away the people

52
00:06:18,095 --> 00:06:21,145
who do not belong to that country.

53
00:06:21,145 --> 00:06:34,255
Yesterday was the Independence Day of India,
and I have seen the flag going up, our national

54
00:06:34,255 --> 00:06:45,235
flag, and the British flag going down.

55
00:06:45,235 --> 00:06:55,995
All that has happened after so much of struggle,
so much of sufferings of the people, because

56
00:06:55,995 --> 00:07:04,065
they came to India, landed nicely there and
became the masters.

57
00:07:04,065 --> 00:07:13,255
So this is also a kind of a conditioning that
comes in a collective way, that you go into

58
00:07:13,255 --> 00:07:20,715
anybody’s country, throw away the people
from there or sort of occupy that place, and

59
00:07:20,715 --> 00:07:21,955
become the masters.

60
00:07:21,955 --> 00:07:29,985
It’s like going into somebody’s house
that belongs to somebody, and throw away the

61
00:07:29,985 --> 00:07:40,245
people who are inside and nicely settle there
as the owners and the masters, because they

62
00:07:40,245 --> 00:07:45,155
have better intelligence, perhaps the cunning
more in them.

63
00:07:45,155 --> 00:07:57,125
With that cunning, if the white people think
they can rule the black people, is not where

64
00:07:57,125 --> 00:08:30,924
you can develop a witness state.

65
00:08:30,924 --> 00:08:39,685
So this kind of conditioning is like a plague
and moves from one country to another country,

66
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:46,065
where some people think they are superior
and make people look inferior.

67
00:08:46,065 --> 00:08:52,165
And the people also are there who accept this
kind of a situation, accept this kind of a

68
00:08:52,165 --> 00:09:00,224
position, where they are supposed to be equal.

69
00:09:00,224 --> 00:09:07,435
I would say take the example of America, because
this has been celebrated by Americans and

70
00:09:07,435 --> 00:09:14,034
because Krishna is the Ruler, Krishna is the
Ruler of America.

71
00:09:14,034 --> 00:09:21,665
He Himself was a dark person, Himself was
on the black side.

72
00:09:21,665 --> 00:09:33,344
And in the same country where He rules, the
another great thing is that they don’t realize

73
00:09:33,344 --> 00:09:43,724
that if all the black or the Asians get out
of that country now, I don’t know what will

74
00:09:43,724 --> 00:09:44,954
happen to them.

75
00:09:44,954 --> 00:09:49,625
All their sports are managed by the blacks.

76
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:58,915
If you want to see any American sport, ninety-nine
per cent are black people.

77
00:09:58,915 --> 00:10:07,024
Then if you want to also see the music, because
these black people, though they have black

78
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:17,124
color - which is all right: as you have white,
they have black color - but they have a voice

79
00:10:17,124 --> 00:10:20,735
which the white people don’t have.

80
00:10:20,735 --> 00:10:26,795
They can sing so well that no white people
can compete with them.

81
00:10:26,795 --> 00:10:33,314
It’s a full justice done to the color.

82
00:10:33,314 --> 00:10:43,555
Now if you take out the Asians, all doctors,
all nurses, all architects, all accountants,

83
00:10:43,555 --> 00:10:47,814
all of them will disappear.

84
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:51,224
Now what will remain?

85
00:10:51,224 --> 00:11:02,014
You have to understand that it is color which
is nothing to do, nothing to do with your

86
00:11:02,014 --> 00:11:08,105
intelligence, with your value system, with
your Spirit.

87
00:11:08,105 --> 00:11:14,385
We are here to achieve our spirituality.

88
00:11:14,385 --> 00:11:26,774
The Spirit doesn’t understand color because
it is so superficial, and it is so very cruel

89
00:11:26,774 --> 00:11:33,024
to condemn someone for the color.

90
00:11:33,024 --> 00:11:36,464
Same now is happening as the reaction.

91
00:11:36,464 --> 00:11:41,295
Every action has a reaction.

92
00:11:41,295 --> 00:11:47,764
So what happens is that you find the blacks
are reacting.

93
00:11:47,764 --> 00:11:53,694
They are reacting, and their reaction can
be very dangerous.

94
00:11:53,694 --> 00:12:07,024
Every day I read their reactions are coming
up so badly; not in America but all over,

95
00:12:07,024 --> 00:12:11,704
they are now thinking they must rise and oppose
this domination.

96
00:12:11,704 --> 00:12:21,714
But in their own country where they have people
of different colors, little variation I think,

97
00:12:21,714 --> 00:12:30,615
they are all black people but little variation
maybe, so they form groups and they start

98
00:12:30,615 --> 00:12:34,534
cutting each other’s throats.

99
00:12:34,534 --> 00:12:39,885
I’ve seen on the television how ruthlessly
they kill.

100
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:48,014
I don’t know what is the difference of color
is, but somehow they have formed groups and

101
00:12:48,014 --> 00:12:52,644
this group will go and kill that, and that
group will come and kill.

102
00:12:52,644 --> 00:12:57,724
It’s not like Kaurava and Pandava.

103
00:12:57,724 --> 00:13:04,214
It’s not two types of people absolutely
opposite, it’s not that the negative and

104
00:13:04,214 --> 00:13:06,694
the positive is there, it’s not.

105
00:13:06,694 --> 00:13:14,384
They are all negative, whether they are white
or black, and they start quarreling and fighting

106
00:13:14,384 --> 00:13:17,514
with each other.

107
00:13:17,514 --> 00:13:19,985
Now this violence is growing so much.

108
00:13:19,985 --> 00:13:27,485
I think violence is the only weapon they use
now to express themselves.

109
00:13:27,485 --> 00:13:37,954
You see here something happens, so somewhere
there you find they explode bombs and kill

110
00:13:37,954 --> 00:13:39,605
so many innocent people.

111
00:13:39,605 --> 00:13:45,334
It’s very, very sinful to do like that.

112
00:13:45,334 --> 00:13:52,385
Even the slightest violence is sinful, and
this kind of a violence, in the eyes of Shri

113
00:13:52,385 --> 00:14:02,555
Krishna, are absolutely to be punished very
well.

114
00:14:02,555 --> 00:14:05,974
Now this comes through ego.

115
00:14:05,974 --> 00:14:13,705
You think because you belong to one clan,
another clan you can kill, or something like

116
00:14:13,705 --> 00:14:14,705
that.

117
00:14:14,705 --> 00:14:22,774
A funny idea into human mind comes in, and
you decide that you have a right to kill another

118
00:14:22,774 --> 00:14:23,784
person.

119
00:14:23,784 --> 00:14:31,224
Or one may say this comes from hatred, but
hatred is an outcome of ego.

120
00:14:31,224 --> 00:14:42,024
When the ego starts acting, it collects all
these things like hatred, also possessiveness,

121
00:14:42,024 --> 00:14:53,384
anger, violence, all these starts coming out
of the ego, which actually blinds the person.

122
00:14:53,384 --> 00:14:59,884
You become blind to the fact that there is
no need to have violence, no need to hate

123
00:14:59,884 --> 00:15:07,855
someone, no need to kill anyone because of
this ego that is there.

124
00:15:07,855 --> 00:15:13,545
Now one may say, “Mother, how does this
ego build up in a people?”

125
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:20,885
Of course, mostly it is due to reactions,
also it is due to the conditioning.

126
00:15:20,885 --> 00:15:28,735
If the child is told from the childhood that
“You should hate these people, they are

127
00:15:28,735 --> 00:15:30,124
to be hated.

128
00:15:30,124 --> 00:15:37,254
They are wrong people, they are bad people,”
they just start doing that.

129
00:15:37,254 --> 00:15:46,154
When they grow up they start showing that
hatred is now like a cactus growing very big,

130
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:48,784
and is killing others.

131
00:15:48,784 --> 00:15:56,124
There’s no justification for this kind of
a behavior by human beings.

132
00:15:56,124 --> 00:16:04,974
If they are human beings they have to have
human qualities, and that is what is possible

133
00:16:04,974 --> 00:16:13,894
only if you learn how to just witness and
not to react.

134
00:16:13,894 --> 00:16:19,524
For example you see two cocks are fighting.

135
00:16:19,524 --> 00:16:22,194
You enjoy that.

136
00:16:22,194 --> 00:16:27,154
Two cocks are fighting, people are enjoying.

137
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:33,404
One cock dies, they are very happy, as if
the one which died had killed his parents

138
00:16:33,404 --> 00:16:35,315
or did something like that.

139
00:16:35,315 --> 00:16:37,235
Very surprising!

140
00:16:37,235 --> 00:16:41,985
Now in Spain even now there are these bull-fights
going on.

141
00:16:41,985 --> 00:16:49,165
Every year six bull-fights, every year, and
the hall contains more than ten times more

142
00:16:49,165 --> 00:16:54,615
than we have here, and is always full.

143
00:16:54,615 --> 00:16:59,175
And now the women have taken to fight the
bulls.

144
00:16:59,175 --> 00:17:04,725
Now if the bull is not killed, they allow
the bulls to go on the street and kill people.

145
00:17:04,725 --> 00:17:19,004
This kind of a violent enjoyment is still
lingering into the minds of the people.

146
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:29,845
It is so sad to see people who are now talking
of humanity, talking of peace, talking of

147
00:17:29,845 --> 00:17:36,614
joy, are still enjoying these violent acts.

148
00:17:36,614 --> 00:17:42,295
Either they are doing or they want to watch.

149
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:49,445
So then you go to these films and things that
have been created of a horrible violence,

150
00:17:49,445 --> 00:17:56,085
and people enjoy it, enjoy such films, and
such films are again created.

151
00:17:56,085 --> 00:18:03,995
Now if you really become a witness state,
if you are in a witness state, then what will

152
00:18:03,995 --> 00:18:04,995
happen?

153
00:18:04,995 --> 00:18:12,775
If you watch any such things that are happening,
it will subside.

154
00:18:12,775 --> 00:18:23,275
If you are in a witness state and if that
level, then no accident will take place in

155
00:18:23,275 --> 00:18:25,275
your sight.

156
00:18:25,275 --> 00:18:34,185
Even if there is an accident, then you can
save the person, you can help the person very

157
00:18:34,185 --> 00:18:35,185
actively.

158
00:18:35,185 --> 00:18:41,905
That’s in a very small scale, but even in
a very large scale you can do it, something

159
00:18:41,905 --> 00:18:42,905
wonderful.

160
00:18:42,905 --> 00:18:50,004
I remember I was not very old at that time,
but we were living in a house very close to

161
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:54,695
the Secretariat, where they had a strike.

162
00:18:54,695 --> 00:19:01,195
And they were asking for a separate Maharashtra
or something.

163
00:19:01,195 --> 00:19:08,625
So the police was standing there and by the
order of the Chief Minister they were shooting

164
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:15,685
at everyone who was coming, anyone who passed
through that road they were shooting, they

165
00:19:15,685 --> 00:19:18,484
were enjoying their shooting game, all of
them.

166
00:19:18,484 --> 00:19:22,155
I saw all this and I just couldn’t bear
it.

167
00:19:22,155 --> 00:19:26,385
I just went down, went down and asked the
police to stop it.

168
00:19:26,385 --> 00:19:30,455
They stopped, you’d be amazed, they stopped.

169
00:19:30,455 --> 00:19:36,415
Then I carried those people who were wounded
up in My house, took out their bullets and

170
00:19:36,415 --> 00:19:39,885
all that, called the ambulance and saved them.

171
00:19:39,885 --> 00:19:46,425
But for that one thing was there: I was in
a state of witnessing, so you become fearless.

172
00:19:46,425 --> 00:19:55,185
There is no fear at all, once you learn how
to have the state of witnessing.

173
00:19:55,185 --> 00:20:03,325
Because when you are not witnessing you get
disturbed, you get upset, you get excited,

174
00:20:03,325 --> 00:20:06,285
you may join also these wrong type of people.

175
00:20:06,285 --> 00:20:14,185
But if you are in a state of witnessing, that
itself is a power.

176
00:20:14,185 --> 00:20:23,545
And that witnessing state helps you to win
over so many difficulties of other people.

177
00:20:23,545 --> 00:20:30,945
There’s this Chinese story about a saint.

178
00:20:30,945 --> 00:20:38,555
So one king brought his cock to him and said,
“You train my cock in such a way that he

179
00:20:38,555 --> 00:20:39,555
should win.”

180
00:20:39,555 --> 00:20:40,765
He said, “All right.”

181
00:20:40,765 --> 00:20:52,415
So he kept the cock of the king for one month
and when the show started, different cocks

182
00:20:52,415 --> 00:20:58,214
came from different places and they all started
fighting.

183
00:20:58,214 --> 00:21:04,615
This cock just stood up and was watching,
just watching.

184
00:21:04,615 --> 00:21:10,374
And other cocks got such a fright, they couldn’t
understand how this fellow is not disturbed,

185
00:21:10,374 --> 00:21:13,734
he’s just watching, he’s standing, he’s
doing nothing.

186
00:21:13,734 --> 00:21:20,395
So all they disappeared from the arena and
he was declared as the successful one.

187
00:21:20,395 --> 00:21:24,825
So this is the best way to bring non-violence.

188
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:34,714
In violent places you go and stand steadily
there, facing all the things that are happening,

189
00:21:34,714 --> 00:21:48,584
and that witness state acts, acts and stops
that kind of a violence that is going on.

190
00:21:48,584 --> 00:21:58,464
But witness state is not a mental state, it
is a state of a spiritual ascent where you

191
00:21:58,464 --> 00:22:02,204
become a witness.

192
00:22:02,204 --> 00:22:10,744
Best way to practice witness state is not
to criticize anyone, not to criticize.

193
00:22:10,744 --> 00:22:15,645
I’ve seen people who are all the time criticizing
others.

194
00:22:15,645 --> 00:22:19,535
They cannot criticize themselves, so they
start criticizing other.

195
00:22:19,535 --> 00:22:24,695
So much so that they don’t even see what’s
wrong with them.

196
00:22:24,695 --> 00:22:30,645
They don’t even see what wrong they have
done to others, because they think they have

197
00:22:30,645 --> 00:22:36,675
a right to criticize others, and they enjoy
this criticism very well.

198
00:22:36,675 --> 00:22:40,345
Actually there’s nothing to be criticized.

199
00:22:40,345 --> 00:22:43,454
You just watch and see for yourself.

200
00:22:43,454 --> 00:22:45,935
That’s all is your right.

201
00:22:45,935 --> 00:22:50,135
You have no right to criticize anyone or anything.

202
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:57,065
But some people think if you do not criticize,
then it will go on like this and it will never

203
00:22:57,065 --> 00:22:58,065
stop.

204
00:22:58,065 --> 00:22:59,065
It’s not that!

205
00:22:59,065 --> 00:23:02,844
Once you watch the thing yourself, only just
watch.

206
00:23:02,844 --> 00:23:11,185
Your attention itself is enlightened now,
with that enlightened attention you can just

207
00:23:11,185 --> 00:23:16,295
watch and stop the nonsense that is there.

208
00:23:16,295 --> 00:23:22,035
But we are always conscious that we are something
great, and we have to do this and we have

209
00:23:22,035 --> 00:23:24,964
to do that.

210
00:23:24,964 --> 00:23:34,575
Under these circumstances what happens is
that you become another problem.

211
00:23:34,575 --> 00:23:37,204
Because what can you do?

212
00:23:37,204 --> 00:23:39,844
You can’t do anything.

213
00:23:39,844 --> 00:23:44,135
But what you can do is to watch.

214
00:23:44,135 --> 00:23:54,155
By watching and by just seeing things as they
are, you really develop a very different state

215
00:23:54,155 --> 00:23:56,364
of being.

216
00:23:56,364 --> 00:24:08,074
Firstly all such people who are just witnessing,
what happens to them is very interesting,

217
00:24:08,074 --> 00:24:14,435
that their memory loss is much less, because
whatever they see becomes like a picture to

218
00:24:14,435 --> 00:24:15,435
them.

219
00:24:15,435 --> 00:24:21,175
Like you can say, they can tell you even the
color, the folding, everything.

220
00:24:21,175 --> 00:24:27,995
Whatever they see is so much in their mind
like a photo, and they can tell you exactly

221
00:24:27,995 --> 00:24:35,765
what they have seen, and your memory is not
lost.

222
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:43,095
While if you react onto everything, your memory
becomes horrible.

223
00:24:43,095 --> 00:24:48,214
And people are so much habituated with reacting.

224
00:24:48,214 --> 00:24:56,765
Like I know of one gentleman, he had a habit
of reacting, and I was going with him in the

225
00:24:56,765 --> 00:24:57,765
car.

226
00:24:57,765 --> 00:25:10,885
So he was reading every advertisement, every
name of every shop, every person, everything.

227
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:13,185
He was just telling, “Who is that?

228
00:25:13,185 --> 00:25:14,295
What is that?”

229
00:25:14,295 --> 00:25:15,295
- this, that.

230
00:25:15,295 --> 00:25:21,074
I was wondering, “Look at this gentleman,
he’s talking so much, what will happen to

231
00:25:21,074 --> 00:25:22,074
him?”

232
00:25:22,074 --> 00:25:29,535
But ultimately I’ve found that all such
people who are all the time reacting become,

233
00:25:29,535 --> 00:25:35,965
actually they have, I think, senile decay
or maybe they become forgetful, very forgetful.

234
00:25:35,965 --> 00:25:41,824
But this is not the only loss we have.

235
00:25:41,824 --> 00:25:49,324
With this kind of people, when they are formed
into a collective they can be very dangerous

236
00:25:49,324 --> 00:25:55,074
people, because with that kind of a nature
they have to do something.

237
00:25:55,074 --> 00:26:01,425
They must do something because, after all,
they are combined together for a purpose or,

238
00:26:01,425 --> 00:26:06,094
we can say, for some reactions which all of
them have built up.

239
00:26:06,094 --> 00:26:11,854
In small things, in big things, you’ll find
people do like that.

240
00:26:11,854 --> 00:26:20,334
And some people who are very much, very much
developed in this kind of behavior can collect

241
00:26:20,334 --> 00:26:24,994
lots of people, and do any amount of harm
to others.

242
00:26:24,994 --> 00:26:28,244
I would look at the picture of Hitler.

243
00:26:28,244 --> 00:26:33,405
For nine years this fellow was watching what
wrongs Jews are doing.

244
00:26:33,405 --> 00:26:43,204
He wouldn’t watch what Germans are doing,
what wrong they are doing to the society.

245
00:26:43,204 --> 00:26:49,825
And that time the society also was very bad,
because they were having all kinds of licentiousness.

246
00:26:49,825 --> 00:26:56,874
Now he was noting down, “These Jews are
like this, they do this, they take money,

247
00:26:56,874 --> 00:27:01,655
they - lending money,” all kinds of things
he got into his head.

248
00:27:01,655 --> 00:27:08,405
As a result of that he built up a reaction
into him that “We must somehow or another

249
00:27:08,405 --> 00:27:13,765
see that these people go away from Germany.”

250
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:19,775
But then he thought, “Even if they go away
from Germany, they’ll prosper again.

251
00:27:19,775 --> 00:27:21,234
So why not kill them?”

252
00:27:21,234 --> 00:27:29,395
I mean, to such an extent that even, you know,
you cannot see such films, you cannot see

253
00:27:29,395 --> 00:27:32,864
anything of that nature that Hitler did.

254
00:27:32,864 --> 00:27:40,864
But he did it, and people who followed him
also did it without feeling any hitch, as

255
00:27:40,864 --> 00:27:48,305
if it was a matter of great pleasure or a
joy, or maybe it’s a duty.

256
00:27:48,305 --> 00:27:54,474
How could they get duty bound to such a horrible
thing like killing thousands and thousands

257
00:27:54,474 --> 00:27:57,665
of Jews?

258
00:27:57,665 --> 00:28:01,915
What Jews had done to them, they could have
corrected it.

259
00:28:01,915 --> 00:28:05,175
But why did they indulge into such violence?

260
00:28:05,175 --> 00:28:09,185
And they wanted to finish all the Jews of
the world.

261
00:28:09,185 --> 00:28:17,454
It can be very, very dangerous, because once
you start losing your witness state you can

262
00:28:17,454 --> 00:28:22,364
fall into negative collectivity.

263
00:28:22,364 --> 00:28:29,464
And thus this negative collectivity acts,
acts in such a bad manner that all the conflicts

264
00:28:29,464 --> 00:28:36,734
of the world, all the problems of the world
perhaps are related with this.

265
00:28:36,734 --> 00:28:47,324
So as Sahaja Yogis, what should we do?

266
00:28:47,324 --> 00:28:58,204
We should not react, we should not react.

267
00:28:58,204 --> 00:29:07,594
If you see something wrong, all right, you
meditate on that point, you meditate.

268
00:29:07,594 --> 00:29:16,464
If you find anything wrong happening, all
right, meditate on that.

269
00:29:16,464 --> 00:29:21,594
If somebody is unkind to you, at that moment
do not react.

270
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:30,864
Afterwards when that person is quietened,
you tell him or tell her, because at that

271
00:29:30,864 --> 00:29:36,585
time when he’s so volatile or she’s volatile
if you tell, nothing will happen.

272
00:29:36,585 --> 00:29:43,984
Gradually, I don’t say always you can win
over such people, but gradually you may be

273
00:29:43,984 --> 00:29:52,795
able to make them understand that it’s wrong,
it’s wrong to do things which they have

274
00:29:52,795 --> 00:29:54,515
been doing.

275
00:29:54,515 --> 00:30:06,574
In a way, you see, the reaction to anything
which is stupid also can be very self-destroying.

276
00:30:06,574 --> 00:30:11,385
Like some people have built-in reactions,
like you have seen this Mr. Clinton behaving.

277
00:30:11,385 --> 00:30:18,545
I mean, you can’t understand a man of his
stature, of his level should have such reactions,

278
00:30:18,545 --> 00:30:25,545
but must be from his childhood or I don’t
know how he built it up.

279
00:30:25,545 --> 00:30:29,614
Now he is in trouble, and very shameful.

280
00:30:29,614 --> 00:30:41,535
This also is, I think perhaps comes from a
very great indulgence into reactions.

281
00:30:41,535 --> 00:30:48,854
Why should you react to a woman, I can’t
understand, or to a man?

282
00:30:48,854 --> 00:30:55,785
And this is one of the biggest problems of
today’s culture, specially in all the developed

283
00:30:55,785 --> 00:31:02,234
countries, that all the time men are looking
at women, women are looking at men.

284
00:31:02,234 --> 00:31:04,015
For what?

285
00:31:04,015 --> 00:31:08,925
Perhaps they look at women because they want
to see how many women are looking at them.

286
00:31:08,925 --> 00:31:16,815
Or they look at men perhaps may be that how
many men are looking at them.

287
00:31:16,815 --> 00:31:19,244
Why, why is this happening?

288
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:25,655
Because they have some inferiority complex
in them, or that they want to attract the

289
00:31:25,655 --> 00:31:26,795
attention of everyone.

290
00:31:26,795 --> 00:31:32,364
I mean, horrible things are done these days
to attract the attention of others, to get

291
00:31:32,364 --> 00:31:33,895
the sympathy of others.

292
00:31:33,895 --> 00:31:39,285
I mean, if you see the level of your awareness
where it goes, you’ll be amazed.

293
00:31:39,285 --> 00:31:46,084
Like they say one lady killed her eight children
just to get sympathy from others.

294
00:31:46,084 --> 00:31:52,844
But think of such horrible things people are
doing.

295
00:31:52,844 --> 00:32:06,336
Now if you want others to have reaction you
do this, that they want others to see you

296
00:32:06,336 --> 00:32:16,194
or to react to you, I don’t know, to give
you importance, you can say.

297
00:32:16,194 --> 00:32:18,185
But what is the use of such an empty importance?

298
00:32:18,185 --> 00:32:29,565
But people are seeking, and is a very common
disease of modern life: all the time how you

299
00:32:29,565 --> 00:32:35,415
should look, how you should appear, how you
should walk.

300
00:32:35,415 --> 00:32:40,715
Everything is so stupid and wastage of energy.

301
00:32:40,715 --> 00:32:52,564
God has created human beings very, very different,
none of them are copies, none of them.

302
00:32:52,564 --> 00:33:01,574
Even in the nature you find the leaves of
trees, they are so unique, you cannot match

303
00:33:01,574 --> 00:33:05,075
them with another leaf.

304
00:33:05,075 --> 00:33:08,945
So that’s how human beings are created,
differently.

305
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:12,825
They are made like that.

306
00:33:12,825 --> 00:33:16,415
One has to accept.

307
00:33:16,415 --> 00:33:18,454
Whatever you are, it’s all right.

308
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:22,645
Why do you want to look like another person?

309
00:33:22,645 --> 00:33:29,485
This kind of reaction is extremely stupid,
I think, that we are spoiling our energy and

310
00:33:29,485 --> 00:33:35,844
life for something absolutely worthless.

311
00:33:35,844 --> 00:33:39,724
Now you being Sahaja Yogis, your worth is
great.

312
00:33:39,724 --> 00:33:51,114
You have come here to emancipate human beings
from these silly ideas and foolish ways, the

313
00:33:51,114 --> 00:33:54,835
way people are behaving.

314
00:33:54,835 --> 00:34:01,175
I don’t know whom to blame, but suddenly
our attention has become very diversified,

315
00:34:01,175 --> 00:34:05,305
our reactions have become very, very funny.

316
00:34:05,305 --> 00:34:13,435
One doesn’t know why people react like that,
and then why do we worry about what people

317
00:34:13,435 --> 00:34:14,435
react?

318
00:34:14,435 --> 00:34:22,955
All these things are not only on individual
level, but also on a collective level.

319
00:34:22,955 --> 00:34:29,085
As a result, you see, new kinds of value system
has been created.

320
00:34:29,085 --> 00:34:39,515
Now for a mother, say for example, she’ll
boast of how many men are running after her.

321
00:34:39,515 --> 00:34:44,225
Or she would think she is a great actress
- I don’t know what they think of themselves.

322
00:34:44,225 --> 00:34:47,624
And the way they talk about themselves is
something surprising.

323
00:34:47,624 --> 00:34:55,625
If she’s a mother, she has to be a good
mother and she has to look like a mother.

324
00:34:55,625 --> 00:35:09,715
But they are so much engrossed or they are
so much standing on the basis that they have

325
00:35:09,715 --> 00:35:20,865
to be extremely attractive, they have to be
the queens or I don’t know what, what a

326
00:35:20,865 --> 00:35:22,565
position they want to have.

327
00:35:22,565 --> 00:35:24,785
Same with the men.

328
00:35:24,785 --> 00:35:34,885
You see, if you have something within you,
if there is any quality within you, is there

329
00:35:34,885 --> 00:35:41,385
anything that can qualify you as a great man,
it will be showing.

330
00:35:41,385 --> 00:35:49,655
You don’t have to advertise, you don’t
have to pamper it, nothing, it will be showing.

331
00:35:49,655 --> 00:35:59,105
So that indifference if you have towards the
public opinion, I think you can achieve a

332
00:35:59,105 --> 00:36:00,295
lot.

333
00:36:00,295 --> 00:36:02,625
Most of the frustrations will disappear.

334
00:36:02,625 --> 00:36:10,865
In Sahaja Yoga also I have seen people want
to show off a lot.

335
00:36:10,865 --> 00:36:13,225
I know who does that.

336
00:36:13,225 --> 00:36:21,855
But they should know, once you do not react
to outside you start reacting to inside, and

337
00:36:21,855 --> 00:36:28,075
introspection will start properly.

338
00:36:28,075 --> 00:36:43,085
When you see yourself you’ll be amazed how
admiring you are, how happy you are.

339
00:36:43,085 --> 00:36:51,835
Now if you go beyond that a little more, then
you don’t think of all these things.

340
00:36:51,835 --> 00:37:02,895
You just become thoughtless and you just stand
up as a person who is respected, whose company

341
00:37:02,895 --> 00:37:11,705
is wanted, who is loved and who is cared for.

342
00:37:11,705 --> 00:37:17,225
So one should not worry as to what people
react, what they say about you, what they

343
00:37:17,225 --> 00:37:19,725
think about you.

344
00:37:19,725 --> 00:37:24,415
You should just introspect and see for yourself.

345
00:37:24,415 --> 00:37:37,945
After some time you don’t need even introspection.

346
00:37:37,945 --> 00:37:47,545
It is a kind of a state I am talking about,
where Shri Krishna told Arjuna that “I will

347
00:37:47,545 --> 00:37:52,015
not fight.

348
00:37:52,015 --> 00:38:02,535
So in between Me and the army, My army, you
have to select.”

349
00:38:02,535 --> 00:38:06,235
So Kauravas said, “No, we’ll take Your
army, Your army.

350
00:38:06,235 --> 00:38:13,205
You give us Your army and we’ll strengthen
our army.”

351
00:38:13,205 --> 00:38:20,725
But Arjuna said, “I don’t want army, I
want You.

352
00:38:20,725 --> 00:38:26,195
You don’t want to fight, it’s all right.”

353
00:38:26,195 --> 00:38:35,955
Because though He will be there in a witness
state only, He won’t be fighting but His

354
00:38:35,955 --> 00:38:38,835
power will act.

355
00:38:38,835 --> 00:38:48,555
He doesn’t have to fight, He doesn’t have
to do anything, but His own power which is

356
00:38:48,555 --> 00:38:57,765
outwardly is silent but will act, and that
is how we will win the war.

357
00:38:57,765 --> 00:39:00,775
So this power of witnessing you all should
develop.

358
00:39:00,775 --> 00:39:18,025
Try to develop it that when you are reacting,
stop reaction, stop reaction about everything.

359
00:39:18,025 --> 00:39:24,015
You will be amazed, you will find yourself
a very, very powerful person in the sense

360
00:39:24,015 --> 00:39:32,935
you’ll have no ambitions, you’ll have
no desires, you’ll have no special fondness

361
00:39:32,935 --> 00:39:35,395
or anything.

362
00:39:35,395 --> 00:39:38,975
But just you are witnessing the drama.

363
00:39:38,975 --> 00:39:46,706
It’s very interesting to witness also, because
then you understand the humor behind everything,

364
00:39:46,706 --> 00:39:52,035
you understand the stupidity behind everything.

365
00:39:52,035 --> 00:40:04,375
You understand also how people have been so
violent, and you just laugh at it; you don’t

366
00:40:04,375 --> 00:40:10,265
get upset, excited, nothing, just laugh at
it.

367
00:40:10,265 --> 00:40:17,415
After some time you’ll be amazed, your witness
state will increase, and when in the collective

368
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:28,636
all of you have that witness state, you can
do wonders without doing anything, without

369
00:40:28,636 --> 00:40:35,975
saying anything, without acting - only your
presence itself can work it out.

370
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:41,825
I don’t say that it will have effect on
everyone, no, can’t say; but most of the

371
00:40:41,825 --> 00:40:45,175
people.

372
00:40:45,175 --> 00:40:56,335
Any person who is in that state, he is the
one who brings peace, he brings joy.

373
00:40:56,335 --> 00:41:06,175
I’ll tell you a story of a Sahaja Yogi who
was going to another island - he was living

374
00:41:06,175 --> 00:41:14,935
in an island - for Sahaja Yoga work, and he
found the whole sky was covered with very

375
00:41:14,935 --> 00:41:17,705
black clouds, thundering clouds.

376
00:41:17,705 --> 00:41:25,865
So he just looked at them like this and he
said, “Wait till I come back.

377
00:41:25,865 --> 00:41:30,355
I am going to do Mother’s work.”

378
00:41:30,355 --> 00:41:41,175
He went to another island, he did the program,
everything happened and when he came back

379
00:41:41,175 --> 00:41:50,875
he wanted to sleep, and suddenly it started
raining and thundering.

380
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:53,575
Even the nature understands.

381
00:41:53,575 --> 00:42:00,335
Nature understands that you are in that great
state of witnessing.

382
00:42:00,335 --> 00:42:07,575
But if you are very ambitious - even in Sahaja
Yoga I have known people who are very ambitious,

383
00:42:07,575 --> 00:42:11,685
they want to become leaders, I don’t know
what else.

384
00:42:11,685 --> 00:42:13,715
Actually, it’s all a myth.

385
00:42:13,715 --> 00:42:21,095
All mythical things they want to get to, and
worry their heads about mythical things.

386
00:42:21,095 --> 00:42:27,985
Once you learn how to witness you will know
the myth, you will know the absurdity, you

387
00:42:27,985 --> 00:42:30,255
will know the maya.

388
00:42:30,255 --> 00:42:42,555
So to overcome the problems of personality
the best thing is to witness, practice witnessing

389
00:42:42,555 --> 00:42:52,675
everything: before talking, practice witnessing,
before giving any comments, just start witnessing.

390
00:42:52,675 --> 00:42:56,755
It’s a very, very satisfying attitude.

391
00:42:56,755 --> 00:43:11,845
In Shri Krishna’s life the greatest power
He was, a witnessing personality.

392
00:43:11,845 --> 00:43:23,025
Without doing anything, without taking a sword
in His hands, without talking about fighting,

393
00:43:23,025 --> 00:43:33,765
He is the One who has helped Pandavas to win
the war.

394
00:43:33,765 --> 00:43:43,515
Not only, but through His “Gita” He has
tried to tell us what we have to do to win

395
00:43:43,515 --> 00:43:46,595
the war over evil.

396
00:43:46,595 --> 00:43:54,865
Whole “Gita” is the witness state He’s
described about.

397
00:43:54,865 --> 00:44:01,225
If you read it “Gita” now from this angle,
you’ll be amazed to find that everywhere

398
00:44:01,225 --> 00:44:07,595
He is like a witness describing everything,
whatever He sees.

399
00:44:07,595 --> 00:44:19,065
And He will tell you how, how this witness
state has helped Him to understand also human

400
00:44:19,065 --> 00:44:20,065
beings.

401
00:44:20,065 --> 00:44:29,465
He is a man who was, we should say, was not
such a big businessman; because first He told

402
00:44:29,465 --> 00:44:32,515
you that how to become sthita pragnya.

403
00:44:32,515 --> 00:44:38,845
“Sthita pragnya” is the one who is in
the witness state.

404
00:44:38,845 --> 00:44:46,435
If you see all these verses on sthita pragnya,
is nothing but a person who is in a witness

405
00:44:46,435 --> 00:44:53,875
state: how he lives, how he is happy, how
he looks at things.

406
00:44:53,875 --> 00:44:56,805
It’s interesting, very interesting.

407
00:44:56,805 --> 00:45:03,015
First He describes that, not like the sharp
people who will describe first the bad things,

408
00:45:03,015 --> 00:45:05,555
but He starts with the best.

409
00:45:05,555 --> 00:45:16,305
Then He goes down to other things and tell
you that whatever are the three aspects.

410
00:45:16,305 --> 00:45:22,955
The first He talks about karma, and many people
get stuck at that point, that “Whatever

411
00:45:22,955 --> 00:45:26,945
karmas we are doing, we’ll get the punyas
out of it.”

412
00:45:26,945 --> 00:45:30,135
But He is not.

413
00:45:30,135 --> 00:45:33,335
He didn’t say that.

414
00:45:33,335 --> 00:45:37,355
If you know Him, then you will know He never
meant that.

415
00:45:37,355 --> 00:45:48,235
What He says, that “Whatever karmas you
have to do, you can do it, but leave the results

416
00:45:48,235 --> 00:45:51,085
to the Divine Power.”

417
00:45:51,085 --> 00:45:58,235
Results are from the Divine Power.

418
00:45:58,235 --> 00:46:06,965
Now may be that some people think that they
have got money because they have done good

419
00:46:06,965 --> 00:46:14,355
karmas, and start doing all kinds of bad karmas
with that money.

420
00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:15,685
He didn’t say that.

421
00:46:15,685 --> 00:46:20,375
He said, “Leave the results to the Divine
Power.”

422
00:46:20,375 --> 00:46:26,435
Because Divine Power knows best what is for
you.

423
00:46:26,435 --> 00:46:32,525
And so if you think you have done something
good, you have served somewhere to the poor,

424
00:46:32,525 --> 00:46:42,005
you have done something really good for the
women or anything; the result of that, you

425
00:46:42,005 --> 00:46:53,175
leave it at the feet of the Divine Power - means
that you don’t build up an ego for whatever

426
00:46:53,175 --> 00:46:55,495
you have done.

427
00:46:55,495 --> 00:47:01,685
Though very well He has written this, but
to understand Him one should have again the

428
00:47:01,685 --> 00:47:07,945
witness state to see what He has written about
karma.

429
00:47:07,945 --> 00:47:10,155
Then He has written about gnyana.

430
00:47:10,155 --> 00:47:14,525
Gnyana means “where you know.”

431
00:47:14,525 --> 00:47:21,105
But that doesn’t mean you go on reading
books, never.

432
00:47:21,105 --> 00:47:29,595
Gnyana means to know what you are.

433
00:47:29,595 --> 00:47:43,085
That means you have to be a Sahaja Yogi, by
which you know so many things through vibrations.

434
00:47:43,085 --> 00:47:49,045
Gnyana doesn’t mean reading books.

435
00:47:49,045 --> 00:47:54,365
By reading books you become more ignorant.

436
00:47:54,365 --> 00:48:03,005
So gnyana means that you must know yourself.

437
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:07,165
If you do not know yourself, you do not know
anything.

438
00:48:07,165 --> 00:48:13,125
So it comes to, that you must get your Self
Realization.

439
00:48:13,125 --> 00:48:14,575
You must know yourself.

440
00:48:14,575 --> 00:48:16,965
It’s the second thing He has said.

441
00:48:16,965 --> 00:48:20,195
Lastly, He talks about bhakti.

442
00:48:20,195 --> 00:48:25,795
Bhakti is devotion.

443
00:48:25,795 --> 00:48:29,975
That too is another trick of Shri Krishna,
the way He describes bhakti.

444
00:48:29,975 --> 00:48:36,875
Now you find people on the street, “Hare
Rama, Hare Krishna” singing.

445
00:48:36,875 --> 00:48:42,695
In one word He is concluded: He says, “You
must do ananya bhakti.”

446
00:48:42,695 --> 00:48:46,995
Ananya means “when there is not the other.”

447
00:48:46,995 --> 00:48:54,275
That means when you have submerged yourself
into the Divine, you are one with the Divine,

448
00:48:54,275 --> 00:48:59,505
then you should do bhakti, otherwise I do
not accept.

449
00:48:59,505 --> 00:49:13,505
He says that “If you give Me some leaves
or some fruits or some flowers, I will accept,

450
00:49:13,505 --> 00:49:23,475
I will accept,” but for Him the real bhakti
is only possible when you become one with

451
00:49:23,475 --> 00:49:30,675
the Divine; otherwise it’s just a show.

452
00:49:30,675 --> 00:49:35,805
So the third bhakti part also comes after
Self Realization.

453
00:49:35,805 --> 00:49:48,365
Now in the bhakti you see there is no “what
is the value is and how much you’ve paid

454
00:49:48,365 --> 00:49:51,825
for it, and how you bought it”- it’s not
important.

455
00:49:51,825 --> 00:50:01,875
For that, a great example is of Shri Rama
when He went in the jungles.

456
00:50:01,875 --> 00:50:13,995
There was a old lady from the schedules caste,
means she was one of the Bhilini as they call

457
00:50:13,995 --> 00:50:18,045
it, these people live in the jungles.

458
00:50:18,045 --> 00:50:25,685
So she brought some berries and offered it
to Shri Ram.

459
00:50:25,685 --> 00:50:34,515
And she said that “I have tasted all of
them and they are not sour, all of them I

460
00:50:34,515 --> 00:50:36,095
have tasted.”

461
00:50:36,095 --> 00:50:44,675
Now after tasting something in India, people
call it, is become not to be eaten.

462
00:50:44,675 --> 00:50:49,635
I mean, we cannot taste something and give
it to somebody else, it’s not done according

463
00:50:49,635 --> 00:50:51,085
to Indian culture.

464
00:50:51,085 --> 00:50:53,495
But Shri Rama took it.

465
00:50:53,495 --> 00:50:57,345
He took it and said, “What beautiful fruits!

466
00:50:57,345 --> 00:51:02,945
I’ve never eaten such fruits!”

467
00:51:02,945 --> 00:51:04,585
So Lakshmana got very angry.

468
00:51:04,585 --> 00:51:10,015
He said, “You stupid woman, you have eaten
these fruits and that’s what you are giving

469
00:51:10,015 --> 00:51:11,205
to Shri Ram.

470
00:51:11,205 --> 00:51:14,925
Why did you do that?”

471
00:51:14,925 --> 00:51:21,445
So Sita was watching, so She asked Him, “Why
don’t You give Me some of these fruits?”

472
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:22,795
He gave.

473
00:51:22,795 --> 00:51:27,255
She said, “My God, what nice fruits these
are!

474
00:51:27,255 --> 00:51:30,295
I have never eaten such good fruits.”

475
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:35,235
So then Lakshmana also, His temper came down
and He said, “Can You not give Me some?”

476
00:51:35,235 --> 00:51:36,345
She said, “Why?

477
00:51:36,345 --> 00:51:39,665
You were so angry, why should I give You?”

478
00:51:39,665 --> 00:51:42,025
Ultimately She gives Him that fruit.

479
00:51:42,025 --> 00:51:43,575
So what did He see in those fruits?

480
00:51:43,575 --> 00:51:56,745
It was the love, the love of this old lady
living in the forest, her love which was important.

481
00:51:56,745 --> 00:52:03,175
So when you want to give something also it
is your love which is important, not how much

482
00:52:03,175 --> 00:52:06,165
you paid, what value you have spent, nothing.

483
00:52:06,165 --> 00:52:13,545
It’s the love with which you do it, and
that love should be evident.

484
00:52:13,545 --> 00:52:22,615
If such things can happen, even with Shri
Krishna the same thing happened.

485
00:52:22,615 --> 00:52:32,325
He went to - they called it Hastinapur in
those days, where these Kauravas were ruling.

486
00:52:32,325 --> 00:52:36,956
And the king was Duryodhana, and he asked
Him, “You come and stay with us and have

487
00:52:36,956 --> 00:52:37,956
food.”

488
00:52:37,956 --> 00:52:40,885
He said, “No, no, I won’t be able to come.”

489
00:52:40,885 --> 00:52:48,295
He goes to another person, Vidhura, who was
the son of a maidservant; Vidhura, because

490
00:52:48,295 --> 00:52:51,885
Vidhura was a realized soul.

491
00:52:51,885 --> 00:52:59,065
He was a realized soul, so He went and ate
in his house, where he had cooked very simple

492
00:52:59,065 --> 00:53:00,065
food.

493
00:53:00,065 --> 00:53:06,125
Because he was a realized soul, to Him he
was the best to have food with.

494
00:53:06,125 --> 00:53:14,395
So your value system should be based on such
things like love.

495
00:53:14,395 --> 00:53:19,735
Where you can get love, you should be attached
to that person.

496
00:53:19,735 --> 00:53:26,135
Where you get a realized soul, you should
be attached to them and not to worldly people

497
00:53:26,135 --> 00:53:29,855
who think no end of themselves, and think
that they are great.

498
00:53:29,855 --> 00:53:39,095
They may be, but to you as Sahaja Yogis it’s
the love of people which should be respected,

499
00:53:39,095 --> 00:53:43,705
should be understood and to be felt.

500
00:53:43,705 --> 00:53:48,885
But if you have no witness state, then you
will see how much money this man has got,

501
00:53:48,885 --> 00:53:57,535
how many cars he has got, what clothes he’s
wearing, all these considerations will be

502
00:53:57,535 --> 00:53:58,535
there.

503
00:53:58,535 --> 00:54:03,705
But in a witness state, you will understand
that you will get vibrations from this person,

504
00:54:03,705 --> 00:54:08,855
you will understand that person is spiritual.

505
00:54:09,105 --> 00:54:18,145
And that’s how you will stick to such a
person, you will not go for artificial things,

506
00:54:18,145 --> 00:54:21,624
but the genuine personalities that are there.

507
00:54:22,003 --> 00:54:23,554
May God bless you all.

508
00:54:24,253 --> 00:54:25,253
Thank you.

509
00:54:49,007 --> 00:54:56,027
Today they have decided to read some of the
names Sahaja Yogis have got with them, and

510
00:54:56,077 --> 00:55:06,347
they want to distribute, they have distributed
these names to you.

511
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:11,480
So somebody will read those names of Shri
Krishna.

512
00:55:11,497 --> 00:55:17,210
Now just imagine with witness state all these
powers that are described of Shri Krishna,

513
00:55:17,244 --> 00:55:22,654
how they will act and how they will work through
you.
