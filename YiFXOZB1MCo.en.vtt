Star TV Interview, Istanbul, Turkey,  01.04.1999

00:01.182 --> 00:05.215
Correspondent: They are picked from a garden, not bought from the florist.

00:09.681 --> 00:12.239
Shri Mataji: Thank you, very kind of you. What‘s the name?

00:12.271 --> 00:15.278
What’s the name of these flowers?

00:16.911 --> 00:19.411
Interviewer: I don’t know.

00:20.072 --> 00:27.513
Shri Mataji: Thank you very much,
thank you. Please sit down.

00:31.608 --> 00:33.703
Correspondent:  Here, the atmosphere here is talismanic

00:33.719 --> 00:35.843
as feeling like inside a fanus,

00:35.868 --> 00:40.749
for maybe this is psychologic or
the natural ambiance of the environment.

00:40.825 --> 00:45.759
I feel like feeling a different kind of peace.

00:59.440 --> 01:02.107
Shri Mataji: very good, absolutely good idea.

01:06.469 --> 01:12.878
Correspondent: I wonder where Madame is coming from either

01:12.903 --> 01:16.954
the depths of Indian Ocean or pinnacles of Himalayas.

01:30.399 --> 01:33.133
Shri Mataji: I am from the centre of India.

01:33.158 --> 01:41.061
Just,  on the Tropic of Cancer, you see, tropic of cancer.

01:42.180 --> 01:45.631
Mecca is also on the Tropic of Cancer.

01:48.727 --> 01:52.625
Shri Mataji: What is you call the Equator?

01:52.701 --> 01:59.172
And above that 23 and a half degrees is called as the ...

02:00.226 --> 02:03.493
Correspondent: In fact I intend to make a compliment.

02:03.510 --> 02:05.843
As She is very deep and a person in heights,

02:05.868 --> 02:13.467
I would like to compliment as  how deep She is,
how developed her inner being

02:13.483 --> 02:15.205
and how She is sitting ever highest peaks.

02:28.527 --> 02:29.606
Shri Mataji: That’s true.

02:29.615 --> 02:34.251
India has a very deep culture,
very deep spiritual culture.

02:34.269 --> 02:38.462
As you had Sufis here,
we had many saints in our country.

02:38.972 --> 02:42.706
Correspondent: What is the content of sorrow and patience?

02:42.731 --> 02:46.400
Indeed, how sorrow and patience is described in this context?

03:01.378 --> 03:04.045
Shri Mataji: It comes out of ignorance.

03:04.136 --> 03:10.003
Because of ignorance and you are so much involved in the worldly life, you see,

03:10.028 --> 03:12.405
that’s why you feel the suffering.

03:12.431 --> 03:14.033
But if you can rise above that,

03:14.058 --> 03:16.459
you don’t feel the sufferings at all.

03:17.747 --> 03:22.074
Yogini: After these modern times, with the technology ,

03:22.099 --> 03:25.093
people are getting more and more far

03:25.101 --> 03:28.119
from inside and from God

03:28.144 --> 03:34.189
and they are not connected.

03:34.566 --> 03:39.116
Shri Mataji: They feel the suffering of
these modern times much more.

03:39.261 --> 03:43.916
Correspondent: There are coincidences in life
important coincidences,

03:43.941 --> 03:47.965
are these coincidences in fact messages
for human beings?

03:55.434 --> 03:58.944
Shri Mataji: Of course, of course.
They are messages.

03:58.984 --> 04:02.261
They are messages for us, to guide.

04:02.973 --> 04:07.039
Yogini: Do You mean when people get these messages

04:07.064 --> 04:11.207
then they can go on the direction to the God,

04:11.232 --> 04:15.947
to be closer and closer if they get  the signs rightness?

04:15.972 --> 04:18.088
Shri Mataji: Especially if they get the desire –

04:18.113 --> 04:22.225
the desire to know why all these problems…

04:22.281 --> 04:26.539
Desire to know the truth, you see.
When that starts coming up

04:26.564 --> 04:30.593
then you take to the path of seeking.

04:30.648 --> 04:33.655
Yogini: God is always inside us,

04:33.658 --> 04:36.842
but the distance between God and us

04:36.867 --> 04:41.022
Its up to  what we do in our life.

04:41.047 --> 04:42.092
Is that right?

04:42.117 --> 04:48.136
Shri Mataji: Yes, Because you cannot
feel your spirit, that’s why.

04:48.161 --> 04:52.389
If you can feel your self,
if you know yourself,

04:52.414 --> 04:55.833
then you are absolutely close to God Almighty.

04:55.858 --> 04:58.304
Correspondent : Then in reality worshipping is

04:58.321 --> 05:01.354
when a person set forth  from his/her house,

05:01.379 --> 05:03.108
is his/her conducts towards human beings,

05:03.133 --> 05:04.712
attitude towards life,

05:04.737 --> 05:06.708
when arriving at home praying with open palms

05:06.733 --> 05:08.806
he opens his hands and says prayer, actually,

05:08.823 --> 05:12.938
in fact the whole daily life is worshipping
to the God. Is it not?

05:30.333 --> 05:31.224
Shri Mataji: [That] is true,

05:31.256 --> 05:33.524
but your heart must be clean.

05:33.549 --> 05:35.432
If your heart is not clean

05:35.442 --> 05:39.539
and if you are just praying to God,
God knows everything.

05:40.990 --> 05:43.186
Correspondent: We have to know that God knows.

05:43.211 --> 05:46.281
Human beings must feel that
they are all the time under Gods governance.

05:52.039 --> 05:56.215
Shri Mataji: Yes, He knows everything
about us and He loves us.

05:56.240 --> 05:59.448
God loves us very much,
He guides us.

05:59.490 --> 06:04.610
But if we do not want to listen to Him
and want to listen to our own whims,

06:04.635 --> 06:07.613
then He says, “All right. Go ahead.”

06:07.997 --> 06:11.094
Correspondent: Does Madame likes to watch movies?

06:14.282 --> 06:16.910
Yogini: Do You like to watch movies, film?

06:16.935 --> 06:19.746
Shri Mataji: Sometimes. Yes, I do, if they are good.

06:22.170 --> 06:24.288
Correspondent: For instance,
did she watch the “Titanic” movie?

06:27.336 --> 06:29.602
Shri Mataji: I did. I did.

06:29.724 --> 06:32.128
Correspondent: I would like
to tell about a coincidence by the way,

06:32.136 --> 06:36.081
it was a film but a film that reflect the reality.

06:36.106 --> 06:40.638
As you know Titanic sank and there were two lovers.

06:40.667 --> 06:44.913
At that time, Rose was on the raft on ocean.

06:46.617 --> 06:49.175
Yogini : From the movie Titanic,

06:49.215 --> 06:53.026
he was very impressed for one part

06:53.051 --> 06:58.492
when the Titanic was under the water,

06:58.517 --> 07:03.123
they were just holding some wooden sticks and so on,

07:03.144 --> 07:05.261
but it was very cold in the night

07:05.286 --> 07:09.637
while he was in the water and girl was sitting on it

07:09.646 --> 07:11.937
and in the morning time boy was frozen

07:11.948 --> 07:16.589
and then, until that time they couldn’t

07:16.614 --> 07:20.050
make other people hear that they need help.

07:20.070 --> 07:24.108
At the end, just at last moment,

07:24.126 --> 07:28.085
just from the near, at that moment they could hear

07:28.110 --> 07:31.400
that she was a live, there is just
one person who is alive.

07:31.425 --> 07:35.220
Is this a blessing from God?

07:35.245 --> 07:38.459
Shri Mataji: Everything is a blessing from God

07:38.484 --> 07:42.971
And, you see, the way we pay more attention

07:42.987 --> 07:46.449
to things which are not important –

07:46.474 --> 07:49.402
then you suffer also.

07:50.117 --> 07:52.365
Correspondent: Did you commit a sin ever?

07:54.535 --> 07:57.807
Yogini: Have You ever made sin?

07:57.845 --> 08:01.649
Yogi: Sin, have You ever sinned?

08:02.513 --> 08:05.229
Shri Mataji: I can’t, very difficult.

08:10.119 --> 08:12.668
Correspondent :  I apoligise asking
a question like this

08:12.693 --> 08:14.763
but all of us are beings created by God.

08:14.788 --> 08:16.752
Sometimes it may happen that we commit sins.

08:16.777 --> 08:19.396
Audience may wonder thats why I ask.

08:34.610 --> 08:40.132
Shri Mataji: I have not. I mean,
from the worldly point of view, maybe.

08:40.175 --> 08:42.700
But from God’s point of view, not.

08:43.142 --> 08:47.236
Correspondent: How She evaluates football?
Is there any team that She supports in any  country?

08:55.624 --> 08:59.423
Shri Mataji:I never support any team, anywhere,

08:59.448 --> 09:02.071
because if you support, you cannot enjoy.

09:02.096 --> 09:07.136
You must keep a balance,
When both parties are different things

09:07.160 --> 09:09.115
I can never take sides.

09:09.697 --> 09:13.992
Correspondent: I heard a sentence in a song,
a singer said so,

09:14.011 --> 09:18.862
there is Armenian, Greek, Muslim, Christian

09:18.897 --> 09:22.605
but the rain falling above us, wets all of us.

09:42.564 --> 09:44.941
Shri Mataji: They are all equal.

09:44.966 --> 09:49.484
This is all a man-made difference;
God has not made that.

09:49.509 --> 09:57.228
Because the thing that works out your realization
is the Kundalini, is in all of you.

09:58.962 --> 10:00.574
Correspondent:  We are all one for God

10:00.599 --> 10:04.068
but with our attitudes I am little away from God

10:04.093 --> 10:06.974
or I am a little closer to you or I am far away.

10:06.991 --> 10:08.961
We determine our proximity to God in fact.

10:08.986 --> 10:11.462
God is in equal distance to all of us.

10:19.958 --> 10:23.939
Shri Mataji: That’s right. In a garden
you have all kinds of flowers

10:23.987 --> 10:26.727
but they grow out of the same Mother Earth, you see.

10:26.748 --> 10:28.663
So there is no difference at all.

10:28.703 --> 10:32.689
But in their own variety…

10:32.714 --> 10:37.957
To create a variety, the beauty of variety,
there are different flowers.

10:38.124 --> 10:39.893
Yogini: Some black, some pink,

10:39.918 --> 10:42.676
some of them pink, black, red,

10:42.701 --> 10:45.491
different diffrent colours, the humans…

10:45.516 --> 10:48.439
Shri Mataji: Yes, that’s what it is.
We are like that also.

10:48.455 --> 10:50.914
There is no difference of each.

10:50.939 --> 10:52.600
They are all flowers.

10:52.625 --> 10:54.991
In the same way, we are all
human beings – there is no difference.

10:55.016 --> 10:57.171
there is no difference.

10:57.196 --> 11:01.678
Correspondent: Sorry, Does the humans are
establishing tomorrow with the actions of today?

11:10.815 --> 11:12.092
Shri Mataji: They are.

11:12.116 --> 11:15.722
They are looking for,
lots of people are looking

11:15.750 --> 11:20.067
for truth or looking for reality, no doubt.

11:21.272 --> 11:24.446
Yogini: Whatever we do in this life

11:24.471 --> 11:30.419
also affects the future. Our children and other…

11:30.427 --> 11:32.752
Shri Mataji: Whole society.

11:32.777 --> 11:34.127
Correspondent : Which kind of music
Madame listens to?

11:34.159 --> 11:36.722
Now I am hearing a tune,
this is probably Indian Music.

11:43.656 --> 11:46.605
Shri Mataji: Every kind. I like Mozart.

11:46.613 --> 11:49.321
I like Vivaldi, I like every kind of music.

11:49.346 --> 11:51.477
Music is more beautiful, you see.

11:51.502 --> 11:53.976
There are different kinds, that’s all.

11:54.001 --> 11:57.650
I don’t like very loud ones.

11:57.925 --> 11:59.983
That breaks my ear.

12:01.361 --> 12:04.494
Yogini: Actually, he says the music

12:04.519 --> 12:07.471
should enter from the ear to the heart.

12:07.495 --> 12:10.946
some of the music are just remaining in the ears,

12:10.971 --> 12:12.418
Shri Mataji: No, no.

12:12.426 --> 12:13.870
Yogini: not going to heart.

12:13.888 --> 12:15.810
Shri Mataji: It blasts your heart.

12:16.258 --> 12:18.328
Shri Mataji: blast, blast your heart

12:19.420 --> 12:23.715
Yogini: What is Your message for the human beings?

12:24.319 --> 12:29.940
Shri Mataji: Message is that all of you
have within yourself a Power,

12:29.965 --> 12:33.168
in the triangular bone known as Sacrum,

12:33.208 --> 12:37.856
which is responsible for your further evolution.

12:37.983 --> 12:42.222
And this gives you a new awareness within you.

12:42.247 --> 12:47.168
When it is awakened,
you get collectively conscious.

12:48.147 --> 12:50.891
Kundalini is like a connection you have.

12:50.916 --> 12:54.767
You have to be connected to the Divine Power of Love,

12:54.792 --> 12:57.216
which is Ruh.

12:57.495 --> 13:01.290
Yogini: Can we say for your... for Sahaja Yoga

13:01.315 --> 13:06.108
it is the answer and the meaning of everything?

13:06.148 --> 13:08.955
Shri Mataji: Of course. Of course
that’s the solution.

13:08.980 --> 13:13.187
Because all problems are because of
human beings who are ignorant.

13:13.228 --> 13:18.724
Once they become one with the Divine,
all problems are solved.

13:18.911 --> 13:21.189
Correspondent: Does Madame likes
Turkish dishes, except those ones

13:21.214 --> 13:23.871
or does She likes these ones?
What kind of food does She eats?

13:23.896 --> 13:28.067
Yogini: He would like to ask
what do You like to eat in Turkey.

13:28.092 --> 13:34.017
Normally, he says all the foreigners
they  like to eat Doner Shish Kebab.

13:34.028 --> 13:37.188
Shri Mataji: I like all kinds of Turkish food

13:37.196 --> 13:40.295
is the best, I think, in the whole world.

13:40.317 --> 13:46.422
Yogini: He says it is not up to us to obtain the timing

13:46.447 --> 13:49.661
when and how everything should happen.

13:49.686 --> 13:52.473
There is a power who does everything.

13:52.498 --> 13:56.804
In his life until he was 45,

13:56.829 --> 14:01.610
everything was very difficult,
struggling on the ground he says.

14:01.619 --> 14:04.895
and after When he was 45,

14:04.920 --> 14:07.633
he felt that something was changed.

14:07.658 --> 14:14.889
And he says in his new life,
this moment,  the moment when he meets You

14:14.914 --> 14:16.996
is the most special moment.

14:17.011 --> 14:18.923
This is a blessing from God.

14:18.948 --> 14:21.030
and that’s why he is thanking to you.

14:21.054 --> 14:22.286
Shri Mataji: Thank you very much.

14:22.311 --> 14:24.324
Thank you very much to think like that.

14:24.332 --> 14:27.211
To me also, this is a great pleasure
to meet you

14:27.236 --> 14:30.407
because he is a very sensitive person.

14:36.034 --> 14:39.274
Yogini : Sit comfortably. Are you comfortable?

14:47.284 --> 14:49.275
Shri Mataji: When you feel the cool breeze

14:49.308 --> 14:52.169
Yogini : Admit when you feel the cool breeze in your hands?

14:52.178 --> 14:54.243
Correspondent: Cool breeze?

14:55.187 --> 14:58.958
Yogini: Breeze of the Sprit.
This is the breeze of the Sprit.

14:59.011 --> 15:00.233
Correspondent: Breeze of Spirit?

15:00.240 --> 15:01.536
Yogini : Yes, Spirit.

15:01.561 --> 15:03.283
Correspondent:  Feels on hands?

15:03.325 --> 15:05.000
Shri Mataji: ...to the divine power.

15:05.128 --> 15:07.017
Yogini : Divine power.

15:16.169 --> 15:21.315
You can feel it at top of your head at the same time.

15:25.754 --> 15:29.216
Interviewer : Yes. I feel it very strongly.

15:29.973 --> 15:36.373
Yogini: Very strongly he feels the breeze on his head.

15:36.398 --> 15:38.604
Yogini: Very strongly he feels.

15:38.629 --> 15:42.481
Shri Mataji: This is the all-pervading power of Divine Love.

15:45.251 --> 15:48.481
Yogini : Other peoples Kundalini also can be awaken.

15:51.573 --> 15:53.731
Correspondent: Was that fast?

15:54.236 --> 15:58.943
Shri Mataji: This is the triangular bone
(showing him on the Sahaj booklet)

16:03.260 --> 16:05.444
It raises through these six centers.

16:08.379 --> 16:11.377
Ultimately it pierces this sixth center

16:11.409 --> 16:14.284
and then you felt it.

16:25.038 --> 16:29.093
Shri Mataji: You can have this and you can feel it.

16:29.731 --> 16:31.875
Correspondent: Will you sign this?

16:31.900 --> 16:33.300
Shri Mataji: All right.

16:42.117 --> 16:47.510
Yogini : It writes “ With my love
and blessings. Mataji Nirmala Devi.”
Mataji Nirmala Devi, yazıyor.

16:49.801 --> 16:54.383
Correspondent: I will carry on my heart.

16:58.937 --> 17:02.310
Yogini: Atatürk. Atatürk is regarded
an enlightened sprit.

17:18.249 --> 17:20.464
Yogini: He is asking if the cameraman
can also get his realization.

17:20.488 --> 17:21.305
Shri Mataji: his self-realization.

17:21.306 --> 17:22.007
Yogini : Yes.

17:24.503 --> 17:27.350
Shri Mataji: Yes, why not.
He is carrying something heavy on his shoulder.

17:27.375 --> 17:29.636
Can he keep it down for a while?

17:31.431 --> 17:39.102
Shri Mataji: (explaining a miracle photograph):
That was [taken] on a boat, on a ride.

17:39.453 --> 17:42.286
That is the day, the 5th of May it was.

17:47.968 --> 17:50.348
Shri Mataji: There were all people sitting here around Me.

17:57.715 --> 18:03.433
Shri Mataji: That was the day -long time
back – was the 5th of May 1970 –

18:03.458 --> 18:04.980
when the Sahasrara was opened

18:13.334 --> 18:15.000
in India.

18:20.262 --> 18:22.270
Shri Mataji: This  happened much later.

18:26.579 --> 18:30.061
We were in [UNCLEAR]  and we were going by boat.

18:30.094 --> 18:34.575
Shri Mataji: At that same time this photo came.

18:42.976 --> 18:44.269
Yogini: The 5th of May?

18:44.285 --> 18:48.346
Shri Mataji: Yes, [the] 5th of May.
But 10 years later.

19:03.790 --> 19:06.443
Yogini: There are a lot of people sitting around You?

19:06.468 --> 19:08.166
Shri Mataji: Yes, but you can’t see them.

19:08.191 --> 19:10.852
They have all disappeared on the sides.

19:16.563 --> 19:18.225
Shri Mataji: This is the last photograph.

19:18.250 --> 19:21.717
but there are other
which show people first

19:21.726 --> 19:23.844
and gradually they disappear.

19:39.635 --> 19:46.752
Shri Mataji: Now this is another one.
With the white saree, standing in the sea.

19:46.808 --> 19:52.624
And this light appeared in the heart,
on My heart.

20:08.460 --> 20:11.303
Shri Mataji: There are thousands of photographs,

20:11.320 --> 20:12.748
Thousands of them.

20:25.628 --> 20:31.140
Shri Mataji: My whole face was covered with the light.

20:31.156 --> 20:33.225
Very strong light

20:33.250 --> 20:37.174
But the flowers are all right there,
nothing happens to them.
