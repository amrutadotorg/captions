Star TV Interview, Istanbul, Turkey,  01.04.1999

00:00:01.182 --> 00:00:05.215
Correspondent: They are picked from a garden, not bought from the florist.

00:00:09.681 --> 00:00:12.239
Shri Mataji: Thank you, very kind of you. What‘s the name?

00:00:12.271 --> 00:00:15.278
What’s the name of these flowers?

00:00:16.911 --> 00:00:19.411
Interviewer: I don’t know.

00:00:20.072 --> 00:00:27.513
Shri Mataji: Thank you very much,
thank you. Please sit down.

00:00:31.608 --> 00:00:33.703
Correspondent:  Here, the atmosphere here is talismanic

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.843
as feeling like inside a fanus,

00:00:35.868 --> 00:00:40.749
for maybe this is psychologic or
the natural ambiance of the environment.

00:00:40.825 --> 00:00:45.759
I feel like feeling a different kind of peace.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.107
Shri Mataji: very good, absolutely good idea.

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:12.878
Correspondent: I wonder where Madame is coming from either

00:01:12.903 --> 00:01:16.954
the depths of Indian Ocean or pinnacles of Himalayas.

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:33.133
Shri Mataji: I am from the centre of India.

00:01:33.158 --> 00:01:41.061
Just,  on the Tropic of Cancer, you see, tropic of cancer.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.631
Mecca is also on the Tropic of Cancer.

00:01:48.727 --> 00:01:52.625
Shri Mataji: What is you call the Equator?

00:01:52.701 --> 00:01:59.172
And above that 23 and a half degrees is called as the ...

00:02:00.226 --> 00:02:03.493
Correspondent: In fact I intend to make a compliment.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.843
As She is very deep and a person in heights,

00:02:05.868 --> 00:02:13.467
I would like to compliment as  how deep She is,
how developed her inner being

00:02:13.483 --> 00:02:15.205
and how She is sitting ever highest peaks.

00:02:28.527 --> 00:02:29.606
Shri Mataji: That’s true.

00:02:29.615 --> 00:02:34.251
India has a very deep culture,
very deep spiritual culture.

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.462
As you had Sufis here,
we had many saints in our country.

00:02:38.972 --> 00:02:42.706
Correspondent: What is the content of sorrow and patience?

00:02:42.731 --> 00:02:46.400
Indeed, how sorrow and patience is described in this context?

00:03:01.378 --> 00:03:04.045
Shri Mataji: It comes out of ignorance.

00:03:04.136 --> 00:03:10.003
Because of ignorance and you are so much involved in the worldly life, you see,

00:03:10.028 --> 00:03:12.405
that’s why you feel the suffering.

00:03:12.431 --> 00:03:14.033
But if you can rise above that,

00:03:14.058 --> 00:03:16.459
you don’t feel the sufferings at all.

00:03:17.747 --> 00:03:22.074
Yogini: After these modern times, with the technology ,

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.093
people are getting more and more far

00:03:25.101 --> 00:03:28.119
from inside and from God

00:03:28.144 --> 00:03:34.189
and they are not connected.

00:03:34.566 --> 00:03:39.116
Shri Mataji: They feel the suffering of
these modern times much more.

00:03:39.261 --> 00:03:43.916
Correspondent: There are coincidences in life
important coincidences,

00:03:43.941 --> 00:03:47.965
are these coincidences in fact messages
for human beings?

00:03:55.434 --> 00:03:58.944
Shri Mataji: Of course, of course.
They are messages.

00:03:58.984 --> 00:04:02.261
They are messages for us, to guide.

00:04:02.973 --> 00:04:07.039
Yogini: Do You mean when people get these messages

00:04:07.064 --> 00:04:11.207
then they can go on the direction to the God,

00:04:11.232 --> 00:04:15.947
to be closer and closer if they get  the signs rightness?

00:04:15.972 --> 00:04:18.088
Shri Mataji: Especially if they get the desire –

00:04:18.113 --> 00:04:22.225
the desire to know why all these problems…

00:04:22.281 --> 00:04:26.539
Desire to know the truth, you see.
When that starts coming up

00:04:26.564 --> 00:04:30.593
then you take to the path of seeking.

00:04:30.648 --> 00:04:33.655
Yogini: God is always inside us,

00:04:33.658 --> 00:04:36.842
but the distance between God and us

00:04:36.867 --> 00:04:41.022
Its up to  what we do in our life.

00:04:41.047 --> 00:04:42.092
Is that right?

00:04:42.117 --> 00:04:48.136
Shri Mataji: Yes, Because you cannot
feel your spirit, that’s why.

00:04:48.161 --> 00:04:52.389
If you can feel your self,
if you know yourself,

00:04:52.414 --> 00:04:55.833
then you are absolutely close to God Almighty.

00:04:55.858 --> 00:04:58.304
Correspondent : Then in reality worshipping is

00:04:58.321 --> 00:05:01.354
when a person set forth  from his/her house,

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:03.108
is his/her conducts towards human beings,

00:05:03.133 --> 00:05:04.712
attitude towards life,

00:05:04.737 --> 00:05:06.708
when arriving at home praying with open palms

00:05:06.733 --> 00:05:08.806
he opens his hands and says prayer, actually,

00:05:08.823 --> 00:05:12.938
in fact the whole daily life is worshipping
to the God. Is it not?

00:05:30.333 --> 00:05:31.224
Shri Mataji: [That] is true,

00:05:31.256 --> 00:05:33.524
but your heart must be clean.

00:05:33.549 --> 00:05:35.432
If your heart is not clean

00:05:35.442 --> 00:05:39.539
and if you are just praying to God,
God knows everything.

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.186
Correspondent: We have to know that God knows.

00:05:43.211 --> 00:05:46.281
Human beings must feel that
they are all the time under Gods governance.

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:56.215
Shri Mataji: Yes, He knows everything
about us and He loves us.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.448
God loves us very much,
He guides us.

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:04.610
But if we do not want to listen to Him
and want to listen to our own whims,

00:06:04.635 --> 00:06:07.613
then He says, “All right. Go ahead.”

00:06:07.997 --> 00:06:11.094
Correspondent: Does Madame likes to watch movies?

00:06:14.282 --> 00:06:16.910
Yogini: Do You like to watch movies, film?

00:06:16.935 --> 00:06:19.746
Shri Mataji: Sometimes. Yes, I do, if they are good.

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:24.288
Correspondent: For instance,
did she watch the “Titanic” movie?

00:06:27.336 --> 00:06:29.602
Shri Mataji: I did. I did.

00:06:29.724 --> 00:06:32.128
Correspondent: I would like
to tell about a coincidence by the way,

00:06:32.136 --> 00:06:36.081
it was a film but a film that reflect the reality.

00:06:36.106 --> 00:06:40.638
As you know Titanic sank and there were two lovers.

00:06:40.667 --> 00:06:44.913
At that time, Rose was on the raft on ocean.

00:06:46.617 --> 00:06:49.175
Yogini : From the movie Titanic,

00:06:49.215 --> 00:06:53.026
he was very impressed for one part

00:06:53.051 --> 00:06:58.492
when the Titanic was under the water,

00:06:58.517 --> 00:07:03.123
they were just holding some wooden sticks and so on,

00:07:03.144 --> 00:07:05.261
but it was very cold in the night

00:07:05.286 --> 00:07:09.637
while he was in the water and girl was sitting on it

00:07:09.646 --> 00:07:11.937
and in the morning time boy was frozen

00:07:11.948 --> 00:07:16.589
and then, until that time they couldn’t

00:07:16.614 --> 00:07:20.050
make other people hear that they need help.

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:24.108
At the end, just at last moment,

00:07:24.126 --> 00:07:28.085
just from the near, at that moment they could hear

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:31.400
that she was a live, there is just
one person who is alive.

00:07:31.425 --> 00:07:35.220
Is this a blessing from God?

00:07:35.245 --> 00:07:38.459
Shri Mataji: Everything is a blessing from God

00:07:38.484 --> 00:07:42.971
And, you see, the way we pay more attention

00:07:42.987 --> 00:07:46.449
to things which are not important –

00:07:46.474 --> 00:07:49.402
then you suffer also.

00:07:50.117 --> 00:07:52.365
Correspondent: Did you commit a sin ever?

00:07:54.535 --> 00:07:57.807
Yogini: Have You ever made sin?

00:07:57.845 --> 00:08:01.649
Yogi: Sin, have You ever sinned?

00:08:02.513 --> 00:08:05.229
Shri Mataji: I can’t, very difficult.

00:08:10.119 --> 00:08:12.668
Correspondent :  I apoligise asking
a question like this

00:08:12.693 --> 00:08:14.763
but all of us are beings created by God.

00:08:14.788 --> 00:08:16.752
Sometimes it may happen that we commit sins.

00:08:16.777 --> 00:08:19.396
Audience may wonder thats why I ask.

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:40.132
Shri Mataji: I have not. I mean,
from the worldly point of view, maybe.

00:08:40.175 --> 00:08:42.700
But from God’s point of view, not.

00:08:43.142 --> 00:08:47.236
Correspondent: How She evaluates football?
Is there any team that She supports in any  country?

00:08:55.624 --> 00:08:59.423
Shri Mataji:I never support any team, anywhere,

00:08:59.448 --> 00:09:02.071
because if you support, you cannot enjoy.

00:09:02.096 --> 00:09:07.136
You must keep a balance,
When both parties are different things

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.115
I can never take sides.

00:09:09.697 --> 00:09:13.992
Correspondent: I heard a sentence in a song,
a singer said so,

00:09:14.011 --> 00:09:18.862
there is Armenian, Greek, Muslim, Christian

00:09:18.897 --> 00:09:22.605
but the rain falling above us, wets all of us.

00:09:42.564 --> 00:09:44.941
Shri Mataji: They are all equal.

00:09:44.966 --> 00:09:49.484
This is all a man-made difference;
God has not made that.

00:09:49.509 --> 00:09:57.228
Because the thing that works out your realization
is the Kundalini, is in all of you.

00:09:58.962 --> 00:10:00.574
Correspondent:  We are all one for God

00:10:00.599 --> 00:10:04.068
but with our attitudes I am little away from God

00:10:04.093 --> 00:10:06.974
or I am a little closer to you or I am far away.

00:10:06.991 --> 00:10:08.961
We determine our proximity to God in fact.

00:10:08.986 --> 00:10:11.462
God is in equal distance to all of us.

00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:23.939
Shri Mataji: That’s right. In a garden
you have all kinds of flowers

00:10:23.987 --> 00:10:26.727
but they grow out of the same Mother Earth, you see.

00:10:26.748 --> 00:10:28.663
So there is no difference at all.

00:10:28.703 --> 00:10:32.689
But in their own variety…

00:10:32.714 --> 00:10:37.957
To create a variety, the beauty of variety,
there are different flowers.

00:10:38.124 --> 00:10:39.893
Yogini: Some black, some pink,

00:10:39.918 --> 00:10:42.676
some of them pink, black, red,

00:10:42.701 --> 00:10:45.491
different diffrent colours, the humans…

00:10:45.516 --> 00:10:48.439
Shri Mataji: Yes, that’s what it is.
We are like that also.

00:10:48.455 --> 00:10:50.914
There is no difference of each.

00:10:50.939 --> 00:10:52.600
They are all flowers.

00:10:52.625 --> 00:10:54.991
In the same way, we are all
human beings – there is no difference.

00:10:55.016 --> 00:10:57.171
there is no difference.

00:10:57.196 --> 00:11:01.678
Correspondent: Sorry, Does the humans are
establishing tomorrow with the actions of today?

00:11:10.815 --> 00:11:12.092
Shri Mataji: They are.

00:11:12.116 --> 00:11:15.722
They are looking for,
lots of people are looking

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:20.067
for truth or looking for reality, no doubt.

00:11:21.272 --> 00:11:24.446
Yogini: Whatever we do in this life

00:11:24.471 --> 00:11:30.419
also affects the future. Our children and other…

00:11:30.427 --> 00:11:32.752
Shri Mataji: Whole society.

00:11:32.777 --> 00:11:34.127
Correspondent : Which kind of music
Madame listens to?

00:11:34.159 --> 00:11:36.722
Now I am hearing a tune,
this is probably Indian Music.

00:11:43.656 --> 00:11:46.605
Shri Mataji: Every kind. I like Mozart.

00:11:46.613 --> 00:11:49.321
I like Vivaldi, I like every kind of music.

00:11:49.346 --> 00:11:51.477
Music is more beautiful, you see.

00:11:51.502 --> 00:11:53.976
There are different kinds, that’s all.

00:11:54.001 --> 00:11:57.650
I don’t like very loud ones.

00:11:57.925 --> 00:11:59.983
That breaks my ear.

00:12:01.361 --> 00:12:04.494
Yogini: Actually, he says the music

00:12:04.519 --> 00:12:07.471
should enter from the ear to the heart.

00:12:07.495 --> 00:12:10.946
some of the music are just remaining in the ears,

00:12:10.971 --> 00:12:12.418
Shri Mataji: No, no.

00:12:12.426 --> 00:12:13.870
Yogini: not going to heart.

00:12:13.888 --> 00:12:15.810
Shri Mataji: It blasts your heart.

00:12:16.258 --> 00:12:18.328
Shri Mataji: blast, blast your heart

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:23.715
Yogini: What is Your message for the human beings?

00:12:24.319 --> 00:12:29.940
Shri Mataji: Message is that all of you
have within yourself a Power,

00:12:29.965 --> 00:12:33.168
in the triangular bone known as Sacrum,

00:12:33.208 --> 00:12:37.856
which is responsible for your further evolution.

00:12:37.983 --> 00:12:42.222
And this gives you a new awareness within you.

00:12:42.247 --> 00:12:47.168
When it is awakened,
you get collectively conscious.

00:12:48.147 --> 00:12:50.891
Kundalini is like a connection you have.

00:12:50.916 --> 00:12:54.767
You have to be connected to the Divine Power of Love,

00:12:54.792 --> 00:12:57.216
which is Ruh.

00:12:57.495 --> 00:13:01.290
Yogini: Can we say for your... for Sahaja Yoga

00:13:01.315 --> 00:13:06.108
it is the answer and the meaning of everything?

00:13:06.148 --> 00:13:08.955
Shri Mataji: Of course. Of course
that’s the solution.

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:13.187
Because all problems are because of
human beings who are ignorant.

00:13:13.228 --> 00:13:18.724
Once they become one with the Divine,
all problems are solved.

00:13:18.911 --> 00:13:21.189
Correspondent: Does Madame likes
Turkish dishes, except those ones

00:13:21.214 --> 00:13:23.871
or does She likes these ones?
What kind of food does She eats?

00:13:23.896 --> 00:13:28.067
Yogini: He would like to ask
what do You like to eat in Turkey.

00:13:28.092 --> 00:13:34.017
Normally, he says all the foreigners
they  like to eat Doner Shish Kebab.

00:13:34.028 --> 00:13:37.188
Shri Mataji: I like all kinds of Turkish food

00:13:37.196 --> 00:13:40.295
is the best, I think, in the whole world.

00:13:40.317 --> 00:13:46.422
Yogini: He says it is not up to us to obtain the timing

00:13:46.447 --> 00:13:49.661
when and how everything should happen.

00:13:49.686 --> 00:13:52.473
There is a power who does everything.

00:13:52.498 --> 00:13:56.804
In his life until he was 45,

00:13:56.829 --> 00:14:01.610
everything was very difficult,
struggling on the ground he says.

00:14:01.619 --> 00:14:04.895
and after When he was 45,

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.633
he felt that something was changed.

00:14:07.658 --> 00:14:14.889
And he says in his new life,
this moment,  the moment when he meets You

00:14:14.914 --> 00:14:16.996
is the most special moment.

00:14:17.011 --> 00:14:18.923
This is a blessing from God.

00:14:18.948 --> 00:14:21.030
and that’s why he is thanking to you.

00:14:21.054 --> 00:14:22.286
Shri Mataji: Thank you very much.

00:14:22.311 --> 00:14:24.324
Thank you very much to think like that.

00:14:24.332 --> 00:14:27.211

00:14:52.178 --> 00:14:54.243

00:14:55.187 --> 00:14:58.958

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.536

00:15:05.128 --> 00:15:07.017
Yogini : Divine power.

00:15:16.169 --> 00:15:21.315
You can feel it at top of your head at the same time.

00:15:25.754 --> 00:15:29.216
Interviewer : Yes. I feel it very strongly.

00:15:29.973 --> 00:15:36.373

00:15:51.573 --> 00:15:53.731
Correspondent: Was that fast?

00:15:54.236 --> 00:15:58.943
Shri Mataji: This is the triangular bone
(showing him on the Sahaj booklet)

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.444
It raises through these six centers.

00:16:08.379 --> 00:16:11.377
Ultimately it pierces this sixth center

00:16:11.409 --> 00:16:14.284
and then you felt it.

00:16:25.038 --> 00:16:29.093
Shri Mataji: You can have this and you can feel it.

00:16:29.731 --> 00:16:31.875

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:33.300
Shri Mataji: All right.

00:16:42.117 --> 00:16:47.510
Yogini : It writes “ With my love
and blessings. Mataji Nirmala Devi.”
Mataji Nirmala Devi, yazıyor.

00:16:49.801 --> 00:16:54.383
Correspondent: I will carry on my heart.

00:16:58.937 --> 00:17:02.310

an enlightened sprit.

00:17:18.249 --> 00:17:20.464
Yogini: He is asking if the cameraman
can also get his realization.

00:17:20.488 --> 00:17:21.305
Shri Mataji: his self-realization.

00:17:21.306 --> 00:17:22.007
Yogini : Yes.

00:17:24.503 --> 00:17:27.350
Shri Mataji: Yes, why not.
He is carrying something heavy on his shoulder.

00:17:27.375 --> 00:17:29.636
Can he keep it down for a while?

00:17:31.431 --> 00:17:39.102
Shri Mataji: (explaining a miracle photograph):
That was [taken] on a boat, on a ride.

00:17:39.453 --> 00:17:42.286
That is the day, the 5th of May it was.

00:17:47.968 --> 00:17:50.348
Shri Mataji: There were all people sitting here around Me.

00:17:57.715 --> 00:18:03.433
Shri Mataji: That was the day -long time
back – was the 5th of May 1970 –

00:18:03.458 --> 00:18:04.980
when the Sahasrara was opened

00:18:13.334 --> 00:18:15.000
in India.

00:18:20.262 --> 00:18:22.270
Shri Mataji: This  happened much later.

00:18:26.579 --> 00:18:30.061
We were in [UNCLEAR]  and we were going by boat.

00:18:30.094 --> 00:18:34.575
Shri Mataji: At that same time this photo came.

00:18:42.976 --> 00:18:44.269
Yogini: The 5th of May?

00:18:44.285 --> 00:18:48.346
Shri Mataji: Yes, [the] 5th of May.
But 10 years later.

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:06.443
Yogini: There are a lot of people sitting around You?

00:19:06.468 --> 00:19:08.166
Shri Mataji: Yes, but you can’t see them.

00:19:08.191 --> 00:19:10.852
They have all disappeared on the sides.

00:19:16.563 --> 00:19:18.225
Shri Mataji: This is the last photograph.

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:21.717
but there are other
which show people first

00:19:21.726 --> 00:19:23.844
and gradually they disappear.

00:19:39.635 --> 00:19:46.752
Shri Mataji: Now this is another one.
With the white saree, standing in the sea.

00:19:46.808 --> 00:19:52.624
And this light appeared in the heart,
on My heart.

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:11.303
Shri Mataji: There are thousands of photographs,

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:12.748
Thousands of them.

00:20:25.628 --> 00:20:31.140
Shri Mataji: My whole face was covered with the light.

00:20:31.156 --> 00:20:33.225
Very strong light

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:37.174
But the flowers are all right there,
nothing happens to them.
