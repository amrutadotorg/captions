Her Holiness Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi
Pune (Shere) Puja Talk, India

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:06.100
December 3, 1990

00:03:27.644 --> 00:03:34.644
[Marathi]

00:04:04.196 --> 00:04:11.196
So, welcome to all the Sahaja Yogis from abroad.

00:04:18.556 --> 00:04:25.556
So we start from today our Maharashtra Tour

00:04:29.634 --> 00:04:36.176
which you can see is full of these hills and dales.

00:04:38.826 --> 00:04:48.563
Also, the atmosphere is going to be extremely rustic.

00:04:50.672 --> 00:04:58.980
Of course, the comforts of this place have not been up to the mark,

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.975
 but next year it will be much better, I'm sure.

00:05:06.021 --> 00:05:09.131
We have decided to purchase even this plot of land,

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:15.084
but as you know we have a land on top, there on the hill - the top.

00:05:15.836 --> 00:05:21.479
That's one of the highest peaks in this area.

00:05:21.941 --> 00:05:26.534
 That land we have already purchased,
and we are going to have an Ashram there,

00:05:26.703 --> 00:05:30.195
 and this would be the place used for [parking ?].

00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:36.366
I hope you like the atmosphere here

00:05:37.087 --> 00:05:40.582
and the surroundings, the nature.

00:05:57.995 --> 00:06:02.563
People in Maharashtra are blessed by great saints

00:06:02.833 --> 00:06:07.100
 and people who were Naths, like Gyaneshwara.

00:06:07.662 --> 00:06:15.369
And that's why they have a tremendous base of spirituality.

00:06:15.717 --> 00:06:22.717
But still they are to be guided to get their Realization.

00:06:28.609 --> 00:06:34.168
As you know that without spirituality,

00:06:34.377 --> 00:06:38.777
the life is very much in - is in imbalance.

00:06:39.186 --> 00:06:46.186
It does not have the totality of enjoyment.

00:06:46.538 --> 00:06:49.756
I don't know if there is any enjoyment otherwise also.

00:06:49.901 --> 00:06:59.855
Because if you just live with your machineries and materialism,

00:07:00.529 --> 00:07:02.807
 they cannot give you joy.

00:07:05.114 --> 00:07:11.199
And that's what you have discovered, the emptiness of life.

00:07:11.938 --> 00:07:15.903
And that's the reason you want spirituality,

00:07:16.638 --> 00:07:25.222
to give a complete expression to your personality -

00:07:26.464 --> 00:07:29.499
which has happened. Luckily it has happened.

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:35.685
I'm very happy to see so many people who have felt it.

00:07:36.257 --> 00:07:41.200
And this is what has to be understood by Indians also,

00:07:41.478 --> 00:07:46.309
 because they think that you people are so well off materially.

00:07:48.428 --> 00:07:54.539
And while they are not - they are spiritually well-off and you are materially well-off.

00:07:54.825 --> 00:07:57.737
 And both the things are so important.

00:07:57.912 --> 00:08:01.864
The foundation has to be strong, of spirituality,

00:08:02.041 --> 00:08:06.221
 and then you can build whatever type of building you want to build on top of that.

00:08:06.412 --> 00:08:10.930
But if you do not have that foundation, then the whole thing collapses.

00:08:11.177 --> 00:08:16.892
Like a tree grows, and it doesn't touch the source

00:08:18.229 --> 00:08:21.656
 of its nourishment, it will definitely collapse.

00:08:21.841 --> 00:08:29.242
This is what Sahaja Yoga is, that you are touching the source of your nourishment,

00:08:29.481 --> 00:08:32.642
nourishment to your civilization.

00:08:32.967 --> 00:08:37.405
And once this nourishment starts flowing, you see

00:08:37.509 --> 00:08:46.538
what's wrong in those countries where people have gone headlong,

00:08:46.899 --> 00:08:52.330
 gone to the extremes, and what they are suffering.

00:08:52.884 --> 00:08:56.043
The people here have no idea about it.

00:08:56.455 --> 00:08:59.971
Also in this country of ours we have lots of

00:09:00.198 --> 00:09:07.198
problems because people are so simple, very vulnerable.

00:09:09.681 --> 00:09:14.120
But dealing with the problems of the West,

00:09:14.509 --> 00:09:18.032
 I feel that there's no way out but Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:23.173
As many as we can save, we should try to save them.

00:09:24.256 --> 00:09:32.762
 Whatever may be the achievements in the West
they are going to boomerang,

00:09:33.564 --> 00:09:38.776
and they may destroy the whole society.

00:09:42.239 --> 00:09:48.058
So, when you are starting the first day here

00:09:48.312 --> 00:09:55.513
you should ask for spirituality, the blessings of spirituality,

00:09:56.345 --> 00:10:04.859
 but also the promise that you will help others who are getting drowned

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:09.040
into the dry materialism of the West.

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:11.984
That's a very important task you have to do.

00:10:12.121 --> 00:10:19.844
You are all enjoying this beautiful life, and you are at peace with yourself,

00:10:20.698 --> 00:10:29.575
but this wine of spirituality has to be shared,

00:10:29.956 --> 00:10:36.814
otherwise life becomes very selfish, self-centered.

00:10:37.018 --> 00:10:43.669
I know you are frightened of those people,
because you think you may catch from them.

00:10:43.914 --> 00:10:50.914
In this tour I hope most of you will be made badha-proof

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:05.058
and fearless. As I told you, you have to touch your depth.

00:11:05.662 --> 00:11:08.935
If you live with superficiality,

00:11:09.214 --> 00:11:14.926
any superficiality in you must be thrown away, then you will sink down.

00:11:15.934 --> 00:11:18.644
There are all kinds of superficialities

00:11:18.787 --> 00:11:23.023
which have come to us as a "blessing" of this Western civilization,

00:11:23.092 --> 00:11:27.414
as also in India we have another. But as I'm talking to you

00:11:27.742 --> 00:11:34.492
 I'll - I would like to tell you about the superficialities
that we have in the West.

00:11:34.728 --> 00:11:39.222
First of all, the another style is our norms and ideas.

00:11:39.254 --> 00:11:41.801
Actually it's all a mental activity,

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:48.890
as I've told you that the whole art of the West is finished.

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:53.674
We cannot have Rembrandt any more.
 We cannot have Michelangelo any more.

00:11:53.825 --> 00:11:58.915
 The reason is, criticism of this art

00:11:59.405 --> 00:12:03.222
has been so much in the modern times that nobody wants to produce anything

00:12:03.343 --> 00:12:07.816
 which will be criticized, and now only situation left is

00:12:07.927 --> 00:12:11.792
that critics are criticizing critics, that's all. No art -

00:12:11.941 --> 00:12:14.419
 because they have no work to do.

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:20.015
So this mental activity of putting everybody down

00:12:20.641 --> 00:12:28.755
and mastering that art, is very dangerous and extremely destructive.

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:39.431
 And this is what is happening I feel,
in the field of every kind of activity:

00:12:41.115 --> 00:12:48.665
 industry, music, art, everything

00:12:49.393 --> 00:12:57.961
that you find; buildings, any enterprise, even politics.

00:12:58.345 --> 00:13:02.065
 Everything has become so superficial

00:13:02.587 --> 00:13:09.149
that you have to be prepared for facing

00:13:09.301 --> 00:13:13.877
all kinds of oppositions and troubles.

00:13:14.947 --> 00:13:19.909
 But still, as you have your own depth, you can master them all

00:13:20.719 --> 00:13:25.304
by your tranquility, by your temperament,

00:13:25.494 --> 00:13:33.541
and by your powers which you have got.
When you are not afraid of that society,

00:13:33.774 --> 00:13:38.182
and when you have that tranquility within you

00:13:38.428 --> 00:13:43.584
and the courage, I'm sure you can do a lot.

00:13:44.095 --> 00:13:47.224
Of course we have some very dynamic people

00:13:47.368 --> 00:13:51.589
 in Sahaja Yoga in the West, and very dynamic women also in the West.

00:13:51.806 --> 00:13:54.480
What may come they never deter.

00:13:54.615 --> 00:13:59.559
And they have worked very hard to do everything possible

00:13:59.861 --> 00:14:02.852
to see that Sahaja Yoga is established.

00:14:03.067 --> 00:14:05.920
So they should be your ideals,

00:14:06.015 --> 00:14:11.701
 and all of you should try to follow them and do the best.

00:14:12.724 --> 00:14:15.977
This tour is a festival for us.

00:14:16.192 --> 00:14:21.377
It's, of course I say it's a pilgrimage but there are no

00:14:21.853 --> 00:14:27.210
 signs of pilgrimage it looks. Because if you see the pilgrims,

00:14:27.589 --> 00:14:32.676
horrible they look, while you are looking like roses, all of you.

00:14:32.907 --> 00:14:37.417
So it's a festival for us and you have to feel that

00:14:37.573 --> 00:14:40.768
festivity within your heart,

00:14:41.496 --> 00:14:48.168
that joy within your heart, and small, small things you should not worry,

00:14:49.155 --> 00:14:54.896
 because these things cannot be provided in all the places.

00:14:55.356 --> 00:14:59.419
 Gradually we'll be building ashrams in all the places

00:14:59.507 --> 00:15:03.812
wherever you have been visiting, but you know how difficult it is,

00:15:04.081 --> 00:15:09.739
 in those days where the India is passing through such a bad phase

00:15:09.895 --> 00:15:16.895
for so many years, where everything is delayed.

00:15:18.756 --> 00:15:24.619
So the attitude should be that: "We have come here for our ascent."

00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:29.689
We have to work out everything with that attitude,

00:15:29.784 --> 00:15:32.200
that we have come here for our ascent,

00:15:32.304 --> 00:15:37.324
and every moment of our ascent is a festive occasion.

00:15:37.436 --> 00:15:39.629
Everything is a festival.

00:15:40.021 --> 00:15:45.970
 If you understand that,
 I am sure you will see the beauty in everything,

00:15:46.213 --> 00:15:50.268
 you will enjoy everything, whatever may be the rustic style.

00:15:50.355 --> 00:15:54.009
Maybe you may not like the color of these lights, I think, because

00:15:54.093 --> 00:15:58.464
you may not enjoy it so much.
You might get much better things in your own country.

00:15:58.686 --> 00:16:01.662
But whatever it is,

00:16:02.027 --> 00:16:07.039
 it's not your conditioning that should stop you from enjoying.

00:16:07.309 --> 00:16:11.557
 So please remember that you are now

00:16:12.009 --> 00:16:17.097
 the member of the Universal Society,

00:16:17.257 --> 00:16:24.190
and we cannot have our conditionings to mar our happiness and joy.

00:16:24.389 --> 00:16:29.381
I want you to enjoy this trip fully, absolutely -

00:16:29.588 --> 00:16:33.217
in a way that you have never enjoyed anything before.

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:36.018
May God bless you!

00:16:49.564 --> 00:16:54.564
