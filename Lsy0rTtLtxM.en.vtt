00:01:25.457 --> 00:01:28.322
I bow to all the seekers of truth

00:01:40.372 --> 00:01:54.941
When we say we are seeking, we must know that
we are a special category of people.

00:01:54.941 --> 00:01:58.601
People were seeking before also.

00:01:58.601 --> 00:02:09.342
They were seeking power, money, possessions,
affluence, every sort of thing.

00:02:09.342 --> 00:02:18.352
Still they are not satisfied - those who have
got it.

00:02:18.352 --> 00:02:29.322
And so those who are seeking the truth are
the highest, highest of all in the evolution.

00:02:29.322 --> 00:02:40.612
They are the ones who are going to jump into
that higher state which is called as self-realization.

00:02:40.612 --> 00:02:47.602
If you are not seeking, then nobody can force
seeking on you.

00:02:47.602 --> 00:02:50.892
It cannot be done.

00:02:50.892 --> 00:03:00.052
Even by force, if you take somebody to the
beautiful lake of nectar of God's love and

00:03:00.052 --> 00:03:07.112
even if you force the person to drink it,
it is you who has to enjoy it and unless and

00:03:07.112 --> 00:03:11.025
until you have the seeking, you will not have
the sensitivity to enjoy that nectar.

00:03:11.025 --> 00:03:17.302
And truth is what it is.

00:03:17.302 --> 00:03:24.612
We cannot change it, we cannot organize it,
we cannot transform it.

00:03:24.612 --> 00:03:30.112
It is, it has been, it will be.

00:03:30.112 --> 00:03:32.002
And what is the truth?

00:03:32.002 --> 00:03:45.012
The truth is that God loves us, that His divine
power of love is all-pervading, is everywhere,

00:03:45.012 --> 00:03:53.251
that this power is acting all the time - it
is a living power of a living God - and that

00:03:53.251 --> 00:03:59.601
this power does all the things that we call
as living work of God.

00:03:59.601 --> 00:04:04.812
A flower is transformed into a fruit by this
power.

00:04:04.812 --> 00:04:07.851
This body we get out of that power.

00:04:07.851 --> 00:04:11.542
From amoeba to this stage we have come out
of that power.

00:04:11.542 --> 00:04:14.521
The whole world is created out of that power.

00:04:14.521 --> 00:04:23.292
In everything that power resides and works
out, sorts out, co-ordinates things for us.

00:04:23.292 --> 00:04:26.071
Above all, it is the love of God.

00:04:26.071 --> 00:04:28.241
It's the compassion of God.

00:04:28.241 --> 00:04:39.122
We human beings have not got the comprehension
of His love; we try to see Him through our

00:04:39.122 --> 00:04:45.251
own angles, through our short sight, through
our blinkers that we have got.

00:04:45.251 --> 00:04:48.842
He is the ocean, ocean of love.

00:04:48.842 --> 00:04:55.281
All the oceans put together cannot be compared
with that ocean of love, that ocean of forgiveness,

00:04:55.281 --> 00:04:59.661
an ocean of complete well-being for us.

00:04:59.661 --> 00:05:04.391
Only thing, we have to jump into it.

00:05:04.391 --> 00:05:09.512
We have to enter into His kingdom.

00:05:09.512 --> 00:05:13.021
That is what one has to do.

00:05:13.021 --> 00:05:16.521
When it is accomplished, then you are just
there.

00:05:16.521 --> 00:05:19.562
You are looked after.

00:05:19.562 --> 00:05:26.891
That is the domain of God I am talking about
and there, when you enter in, as a by-product,

00:05:26.891 --> 00:05:34.282
all kinds of well-being are blessed upon you,
just they are bestowed upon you.

00:05:34.282 --> 00:05:37.432
You just get them automatically.

00:05:37.432 --> 00:05:42.452
But this happening also is not our doing.

00:05:42.452 --> 00:05:45.392
This also is the doing of God.

00:05:45.392 --> 00:05:52.311
He has arranged us in this way that you can
see in the chart - this is the life tree - or

00:05:52.311 --> 00:05:55.572
you (can) say the tree of life as described.

00:05:55.572 --> 00:05:58.272
And this is the one that is within us already
placed.

00:05:58.272 --> 00:06:10.152
All these centers, which are subtle centers,
are expressed outside as gross centers.

00:06:10.152 --> 00:06:16.712
When this residual force of Kundalini, which
people must have explained to you, from that

00:06:16.712 --> 00:06:23.952
sacred bone or sacrum rises and pierces through
all these centers, it enlightens all of them

00:06:23.952 --> 00:06:25.302
one by one.

00:06:25.302 --> 00:06:32.702
By that enlightenment only, you get your physical
well-being, your mental well-being, your emotional

00:06:32.702 --> 00:06:36.532
well-being and ultimately, your spiritual
well being.

00:06:36.532 --> 00:06:38.932
That means you become the spirit.

00:06:38.932 --> 00:06:44.772
Once you become that absolute, the absolute,
then all relativity drops off.

00:06:44.772 --> 00:06:49.842
We actually live in a relative world which
is false, which is not true.

00:06:49.842 --> 00:06:54.952
This power has its own telecommunication.

00:06:54.952 --> 00:07:00.612
It's so tremendous that it is unbelievable
that such a power exists around us and we

00:07:00.612 --> 00:07:02.462
are not aware of it.

00:07:02.462 --> 00:07:04.222
We are not aware of many things.

00:07:04.222 --> 00:07:08.362
We are not aware that this Mother Earth is
moving with such a tremendous speed.

00:07:08.362 --> 00:07:11.552
We are standing on top of that; nothing happens
to you.

00:07:11.552 --> 00:07:13.802
We are not aware of the gravity.

00:07:13.802 --> 00:07:21.852
We are not aware of many things because God
is so kind, so gentle and so thoughtful that

00:07:21.852 --> 00:07:25.222
He wants us to live happily as human beings.

00:07:25.222 --> 00:07:34.222
So He doesn't want us to hear some things
which are not good for us, for our ears, so

00:07:34.222 --> 00:07:38.782
He makes the frequency of these things so
sharp that we can't hear with these ears.

00:07:38.782 --> 00:07:44.262
Some of them, He makes them so low that you
can't hear.

00:07:44.262 --> 00:07:47.192
Only what you can hear and enjoy He makes
you hear.

00:07:47.192 --> 00:07:54.262
But we in our freedom have done a lot of wrong
to ourselves, to each other, to our society,

00:07:54.262 --> 00:07:56.542
to the whole world.

00:07:56.542 --> 00:08:08.472
Once we realize, this freedom is nothing but
is our ego, our ego, which has created this

00:08:08.472 --> 00:08:12.172
problem for all other people.

00:08:12.172 --> 00:08:17.902
Then we have also another thing where we get
conditioned, which creates the superego.

00:08:17.902 --> 00:08:23.122
Now in our activity, which is the right side
sympathetic nervous system, we accumulate

00:08:23.122 --> 00:08:29.812
this horrible thing called ego, because when
we act, we think we are doing it, we are in-charge.

00:08:29.812 --> 00:08:31.512
We are not.

00:08:31.512 --> 00:08:33.772
He is in charge.

00:08:33.772 --> 00:08:36.592
We are really doing nothing.

00:08:36.592 --> 00:08:38.862
What are we doing?

00:08:38.862 --> 00:08:45.762
Like the people ask me, "Mother how can you
cure everything so easily?"

00:08:45.762 --> 00:08:47.132
It's simple.

00:08:47.132 --> 00:08:48.514
How do you make a flower into a fruit?

00:08:48.514 --> 00:08:50.062
To us, we take it for granted.

00:08:50.062 --> 00:08:53.612
We are not bothered to find out, but can you
do it?

00:08:53.612 --> 00:08:54.632
It's so difficult.

00:08:54.632 --> 00:08:56.542
Can you do it?

00:08:56.542 --> 00:08:59.042
We can't.

00:08:59.042 --> 00:09:01.942
But if it is God's power, it can do it.

00:09:01.942 --> 00:09:07.152
So if you also have the God's power flowing
in you, which will happen to you as soon as

00:09:07.152 --> 00:09:11.052
you get your realization, you can do it; anybody
can do it.

00:09:11.052 --> 00:09:12.121
It's very simple.

00:09:12.121 --> 00:09:17.392
Like any instrument, when it is put to the
mains, it starts acting and then we can see

00:09:17.392 --> 00:09:19.622
that it is an instrument.

00:09:19.622 --> 00:09:23.692
Otherwise it looks like some funny stuff here.

00:09:23.692 --> 00:09:25.002
It has to be put to the mains.

00:09:25.002 --> 00:09:30.442
The instrument is ready, but within us these
two things, called the ego and superego as

00:09:30.442 --> 00:09:36.922
a result of our activity and as a result of
our conditioning, are accumulated in our brain.

00:09:36.922 --> 00:09:40.512
These two are to be sucked in.

00:09:40.512 --> 00:09:48.401
That's very important because when they grow,
these two elements - or two, we can, say balloon-like

00:09:48.401 --> 00:10:00.342
structures - they make a very strong gap filled
with calcium and you become an egg.

00:10:00.342 --> 00:10:01.342
Another becomes an egg.

00:10:01.342 --> 00:10:03.001
Third person becomes an egg.

00:10:03.001 --> 00:10:08.872
You develop your I-ness - I am this, I am
that.

00:10:08.872 --> 00:10:15.132
All kinds of misidentifications start coming
on us.

00:10:15.132 --> 00:10:20.042
When this is to be sucked, what should we
do?

00:10:20.042 --> 00:10:22.492
That's the question.

00:10:22.492 --> 00:10:23.752
What are we to do?

00:10:23.752 --> 00:10:25.932
To raise the Kundalini.

00:10:25.932 --> 00:10:31.282
As I said, it is a living process and you
cannot do any living work - so just can't

00:10:31.282 --> 00:10:32.282
do it.

00:10:32.282 --> 00:10:33.282
It is as simple as that.

00:10:33.282 --> 00:10:36.712
You yourself can't do it.

00:10:36.712 --> 00:10:43.222
But somebody who is enlightened, who is the
light, can enlighten another light, because

00:10:43.222 --> 00:10:49.092
that light is ready, just ready, but you need
an enlightened light to enlighten that light.

00:10:49.092 --> 00:10:52.702
Once that light is enlightened, that light
can enlighten another light.

00:10:52.702 --> 00:10:57.592
But the problem is when the light which is
enlightened tries to say that "You are to

00:10:57.592 --> 00:10:59.672
be enlightened," immediately you hit that
person.

00:10:59.672 --> 00:11:04.052
You don't like it because ego is there, which
is ignorance.

00:11:04.052 --> 00:11:06.862
That's how people like Christ were crucified.

00:11:06.862 --> 00:11:11.422
What wrong did He do to people except that,
see, He said, "I am the light?"

00:11:11.422 --> 00:11:12.422
It's true.

00:11:12.422 --> 00:11:13.422
He was the light.

00:11:13.422 --> 00:11:15.132
No doubt that He was the son of God.

00:11:15.132 --> 00:11:20.382
It's true, He was the son of God which you
can prove - on vibrations.

00:11:20.382 --> 00:11:24.142
By this Sahaja Yoga, you can prove it what
He was.

00:11:24.142 --> 00:11:27.582
He was that, but that time people killed Him.

00:11:27.582 --> 00:11:28.582
Why?

00:11:28.582 --> 00:11:32.512
Only because He said, "I am the light," and
that you were to be enlightened by Him.

00:11:32.512 --> 00:11:39.492
You allowed him to live only for four years,
and when He was killed, when He was crucified,

00:11:39.492 --> 00:11:44.732
you took advantage out of that and made all
kinds of artificial things out of it.

00:11:44.732 --> 00:11:47.572
He could not explain many things which He
talked.

00:11:47.572 --> 00:11:50.682
He could not say anything.

00:11:50.682 --> 00:11:53.592
On the cross He said, "It has been accomplished."

00:11:53.592 --> 00:11:55.872
What has been accomplished?

00:11:55.872 --> 00:11:57.842
Nobody thinks about it - what has been accomplished.

00:11:57.842 --> 00:12:04.602
So we have to take reference from other people,
those who have been deeper than us, who have

00:12:04.602 --> 00:12:08.501
gone into it, who have found out certain things
about Christ.

00:12:08.501 --> 00:12:14.622
And they say that Christ accomplished the
greatest thing, the greatest feat, because

00:12:14.622 --> 00:12:17.012
He was nothing but Omkara.

00:12:17.012 --> 00:12:20.922
He was nothing but the vibrations.

00:12:20.922 --> 00:12:25.162
That's why He had no body and only He could
accomplish it.

00:12:25.162 --> 00:12:26.162
And what did He do?

00:12:26.162 --> 00:12:33.202
Is to accomplish Himself on this cross where
we have this ego and superego.

00:12:33.202 --> 00:12:34.852
Of course they say that He said he died for
our sins.

00:12:34.852 --> 00:12:35.852
How did He die for our sins?

00:12:35.852 --> 00:12:40.402
We say that He died for our sins.

00:12:40.402 --> 00:12:45.342
We accept it, yes, because Churches are telling,
people are telling, Bible is telling.

00:12:45.342 --> 00:12:46.602
But how?

00:12:46.602 --> 00:12:47.752
He suffered for us.

00:12:47.752 --> 00:12:50.652
Then why are we suffering?

00:12:50.652 --> 00:12:54.942
But when He said, "You are to be born again,"
we don't pay any attention to that.

00:12:54.942 --> 00:12:56.982
For that you have found out an escape.

00:12:56.982 --> 00:13:04.192
You take your child to the church and they
put some water artificially and you accept,

00:13:04.192 --> 00:13:06.542
"All right, we are born again."

00:13:06.542 --> 00:13:09.682
I met people who are certified born again.

00:13:09.682 --> 00:13:12.572
They quarrel with me and fought with me for
nothing at all.

00:13:12.572 --> 00:13:15.242
I said, "How are you born again?

00:13:15.242 --> 00:13:19.672
If you are born again, that means an egg becomes
a bird.

00:13:19.672 --> 00:13:21.762
Have you become something different?

00:13:21.762 --> 00:13:25.162
Is there any transformation in you?

00:13:25.162 --> 00:13:26.162
How do you believe?

00:13:26.162 --> 00:13:27.162
Why are you so self-opinionated?

00:13:27.162 --> 00:13:32.002
If you are born again, what happens to you?

00:13:32.002 --> 00:13:33.002
What happens to you?

00:13:33.002 --> 00:13:34.902
What is born again in you?"

00:13:34.902 --> 00:13:42.002
Born again is nothing but the Kundalini awakening,
which rises on top of your head and here is

00:13:42.002 --> 00:13:44.532
the seat of your Spirit.

00:13:44.532 --> 00:13:49.582
Of course, it resides in your heart, but the
seat of the Spirit is here, and once it touches

00:13:49.582 --> 00:13:54.882
that seat, immediately you start feeling that
subtle thing which is all-pervading within

00:13:54.882 --> 00:13:55.882
you.

00:13:55.882 --> 00:13:58.201
For the first time you feel this cool breeze
of the Holy Ghost.

00:13:58.201 --> 00:14:06.462
Holy Ghost is nothing but the power of God,
the power of His love, which is called as

00:14:06.462 --> 00:14:09.022
Adi Shakti in Sanskrit language.

00:14:09.022 --> 00:14:15.042
We don't have to accept anything else from
outside, any dictionary we don't have to accept

00:14:15.042 --> 00:14:21.011
to give answers to things, to mysteries that
we have been suffering all these days.

00:14:21.011 --> 00:14:33.102
Once this cross, which is between the ego
and superego is enlightened, Christ is awakened

00:14:33.102 --> 00:14:34.102
there.

00:14:34.102 --> 00:14:41.222
He sucks in both these things, your karmas,
your actions and your conditionings, your

00:14:41.222 --> 00:14:42.222
sins.

00:14:42.222 --> 00:14:43.222
It is sucked in.

00:14:43.222 --> 00:14:46.842
There is no more for you to suffer.

00:14:46.842 --> 00:14:48.201
Why do you want to suffer?

00:14:48.201 --> 00:14:53.362
Some people have started another theory that
we must suffer if we have to go to Christ.

00:14:53.362 --> 00:14:54.362
Why?

00:14:54.362 --> 00:14:57.303
Did He not suffer for you sufficiently?

00:14:57.303 --> 00:14:58.303
Did He not do that?

00:14:58.303 --> 00:15:00.642
He has done it, then why suffer?

00:15:00.642 --> 00:15:04.712
Be joyous that He established himself there
at that point.

00:15:04.712 --> 00:15:10.212
In the Hindu scriptures, He is called as Maha
Vishnu.

00:15:10.212 --> 00:15:13.992
But if I tell this to them that this was Christ,
they won't believe Me.

00:15:13.992 --> 00:15:16.235
If I tell this to Christians, they won't believe
Me.

00:15:16.235 --> 00:15:19.562
They don't want to believe it because for
them Christ is their contract.

00:15:19.562 --> 00:15:24.141
They have a contract with Christ, as if they
are the contractors of Christ.

00:15:24.141 --> 00:15:25.422
Nobody dare say anything about Christ.

00:15:25.422 --> 00:15:30.942
It's only they who are the Christians, and
they who are the Hindus, they who are the

00:15:30.942 --> 00:15:36.192
Sikhs, they who are the Muslims and they don't
know anything about reality.

00:15:36.192 --> 00:15:42.692
Just fighting morning till evening in the
name of God, the One who is the ocean of love,

00:15:42.692 --> 00:15:45.602
compassion and bliss.

00:15:45.602 --> 00:15:55.712
They are so disturbed, so upset, so violent
that one can easily see there is nowhere the

00:15:55.712 --> 00:15:57.152
blessings of God.

00:15:57.152 --> 00:15:59.562
There is no blissful state.

00:15:59.562 --> 00:16:01.082
There is no peace in them.

00:16:01.082 --> 00:16:07.642
Because there is no peace within, how can
you have the peace without?

00:16:07.642 --> 00:16:12.222
And this is what it is that one should understand
- that in the name of God, many things have

00:16:12.222 --> 00:16:14.852
been done which are absolutely against it.

00:16:14.852 --> 00:16:19.582
They are anti-God activities because if you
become a fanatic, you are anti-God, absolutely

00:16:19.582 --> 00:16:20.582
anti-God.

00:16:20.582 --> 00:16:26.352
You have to see that God exists for the whole
universe.

00:16:26.352 --> 00:16:31.112
Nobody can take His contract and can organize
it.

00:16:31.112 --> 00:16:36.742
When I say this, of course there will be people
who are interested in things with which they

00:16:36.742 --> 00:16:37.742
are identified.

00:16:37.742 --> 00:16:43.372
They want to carry on with that kind of identification;
maybe they get some money out of it, maybe

00:16:43.372 --> 00:16:45.382
some sort of a name or something free.

00:16:45.382 --> 00:16:48.102
But what is most important is your Spirit.

00:16:48.102 --> 00:16:52.572
Why identify with anything else but your own
spirit?

00:16:52.572 --> 00:16:54.702
You cannot get money out of it.

00:16:54.702 --> 00:16:55.702
No.

00:16:55.702 --> 00:16:57.342
The joy of Spirit is the reward of Spirit.

00:16:57.342 --> 00:16:58.641
Why do you want money?

00:16:58.641 --> 00:17:02.982
Why do you want fame for it?

00:17:02.982 --> 00:17:07.092
Why do you want anything of these worldly
things that are so transitory, temporary,

00:17:07.092 --> 00:17:08.372
will finish off?

00:17:08.372 --> 00:17:11.842
Why not ask for something that is eternal?

00:17:11.842 --> 00:17:14.122
Why not ask for the eternal life of Spirit?

00:17:14.122 --> 00:17:18.932
And that if you ask, it is at your door steps,
you can get it.

00:17:18.932 --> 00:17:20.682
It's very simple and easy.

00:17:20.682 --> 00:17:22.881
When you say it is simple, people can't understand.

00:17:22.881 --> 00:17:24.321
They think, "How can it be?

00:17:24.321 --> 00:17:29.592
You have to stand on your head for one life
then you have to stand on one leg for one

00:17:29.592 --> 00:17:30.592
life."

00:17:30.592 --> 00:17:31.832
That's the idea they have got about Christ.

00:17:31.832 --> 00:17:35.952
There is no need to do that - Christ has done
it for you.

00:17:35.952 --> 00:17:38.632
Believe me, He has done it.

00:17:38.632 --> 00:17:42.201
So now, how to understand it is simple?

00:17:42.201 --> 00:17:45.882
In this room, say, there are so many lights
and we all can see each other.

00:17:45.882 --> 00:17:48.002
The room is enlightened.

00:17:48.002 --> 00:17:49.282
But what did you do?

00:17:49.282 --> 00:17:54.201
You just switched on one switch, very simple.

00:17:54.201 --> 00:17:55.492
If you ask anybody, "How do I put the light
on?"

00:17:55.492 --> 00:17:56.492
I just put.

00:17:56.492 --> 00:17:58.092
There is a light there.

00:17:58.092 --> 00:17:59.141
Just switch on.

00:17:59.141 --> 00:18:01.252
That's how you get the light.

00:18:01.252 --> 00:18:05.062
But for a person who has never seen electricity,
it must be a wonder.

00:18:05.062 --> 00:18:07.512
How just switching on light, so simple.

00:18:07.512 --> 00:18:09.462
It is not in a way.

00:18:09.462 --> 00:18:14.141
It is made simple for you, but there is a
big organization behind it.

00:18:14.141 --> 00:18:19.622
There is a big history behind it and there
are so many people who are working it out.

00:18:19.622 --> 00:18:23.002
There is a big machinery.

00:18:23.002 --> 00:18:28.752
In the same way, whatever looks so simple
to us is tremendous, is great.

00:18:28.752 --> 00:18:36.311
But God Almighty with His care and tenderness
doesn't want you to know anything about it.

00:18:36.311 --> 00:18:37.382
Forget it.

00:18:37.382 --> 00:18:40.042
You just jump into it.

00:18:40.042 --> 00:18:43.852
You just enter into the kingdom of God and
enjoy the bliss, that's all.

00:18:43.852 --> 00:18:45.771
Why do you want to bother about these things?

00:18:45.771 --> 00:18:51.732
Of course, as we are very thought-oriented,
people want to know about it.

00:18:51.732 --> 00:18:55.772
That's why one has to talk about these things.

00:18:55.772 --> 00:19:04.232
But best is to get your enlightenment first
and then talk of it.

00:19:04.232 --> 00:19:11.642
It's a headache to talk about the electricity
and about its history, where it enters and

00:19:11.642 --> 00:19:16.862
the problems they have had and then after
all these when you have tumbled down, fallen

00:19:16.862 --> 00:19:21.962
down, everybody hit each other, kicked each
other, then say, "All right, now it's very

00:19:21.962 --> 00:19:22.962
simple.

00:19:22.962 --> 00:19:24.002
Just put on the light."

00:19:24.002 --> 00:19:27.992
It's better to be other way round, that I
say, "All right, put on the light, and then

00:19:27.992 --> 00:19:29.642
we'll talk about it."

00:19:29.642 --> 00:19:35.692
I am so happy to see so many people in Cambridge
today, really very happy because I have been

00:19:35.692 --> 00:19:37.332
here before also.

00:19:37.332 --> 00:19:39.222
But we had no response.

00:19:39.222 --> 00:19:40.362
I was surprised.

00:19:40.362 --> 00:19:45.062
Here where there are many false gurus are
working out their tricks.

00:19:45.062 --> 00:19:50.562
People have collected thousands of pounds
from this place, Cambridge, which is the seat

00:19:50.562 --> 00:19:51.671
of learning.

00:19:51.671 --> 00:19:58.132
Here so many educated people live, intelligent
people live - have been befooled completely

00:19:58.132 --> 00:20:00.062
and have been pampered.

00:20:00.062 --> 00:20:02.462
Their ego has been pampered.

00:20:02.462 --> 00:20:07.042
They have gone into such trips which are very
dangerous.

00:20:07.042 --> 00:20:14.332
We had somebody from Cambridge in Sahaja Yoga,
very well educated person, got into epilepsy,

00:20:14.332 --> 00:20:16.652
going to such a horrible fellow.

00:20:16.652 --> 00:20:21.722
Lost all his money, everything, bankrupt and
also epileptic.

00:20:21.722 --> 00:20:27.842
Educated, very well educated, first class
boy, ruined for his life.

00:20:27.842 --> 00:20:33.232
But why it happens to us, we must think.

00:20:33.232 --> 00:20:35.652
Why we are enamored by such people?

00:20:35.652 --> 00:20:41.662
Because we believe in the superficial thing;
because it is being advertised in such a way.

00:20:41.662 --> 00:20:45.352
These people come with a circus because they
have to attract you.

00:20:45.352 --> 00:20:47.682
They have to attract you for their purses.

00:20:47.682 --> 00:20:53.992
They have to attract you for their own powers
because they want that people should be dominated

00:20:53.992 --> 00:20:56.432
by them because they can extract money.

00:20:56.432 --> 00:21:02.032
Their interests are very low, base and we
don't see it.

00:21:02.032 --> 00:21:03.421
We don't understand it.

00:21:03.421 --> 00:21:04.932
They pamper our ego.

00:21:04.932 --> 00:21:07.614
They talk of big things, "We are going to
make you a minister.

00:21:07.614 --> 00:21:09.712
We are going to do this."

00:21:09.712 --> 00:21:11.661
We say, "All right."

00:21:11.661 --> 00:21:14.092
We follow all this nonsense.

00:21:14.092 --> 00:21:15.092
Imagine.

00:21:15.092 --> 00:21:17.642
This ego is such a tricky thing.

00:21:17.642 --> 00:21:22.842
It plays tricks not only with others but plays
with yourself also.

00:21:22.842 --> 00:21:23.842
It cheats you.

00:21:23.842 --> 00:21:28.852
The so-called intelligence of the ego can
cheat you and that's how many people are lost.

00:21:28.852 --> 00:21:34.932
Those who are seekers of ages are lost because
these horrible satanic forces know how to

00:21:34.932 --> 00:21:43.002
play the trick, how to play the trick with
you and how to take you to their own domain

00:21:43.002 --> 00:21:47.582
of satanic forces by which they could extract
all your blood.

00:21:47.582 --> 00:21:52.422
I am so sorry when I hear that these things
have been happening all over.

00:21:52.422 --> 00:21:58.572
But in the places where there has been the
seat of love, the Goddess Saraswati reigns,

00:21:58.572 --> 00:22:07.372
where people educate themselves, all these
thing have come slowly and settled down.

00:22:07.372 --> 00:22:10.442
There are other things also which are very
dangerous.

00:22:10.442 --> 00:22:12.752
Like people who are, call themselves, psychologists.

00:22:12.752 --> 00:22:14.922
They can be very dangerous people.

00:22:14.922 --> 00:22:16.232
They are unauthorized.

00:22:16.232 --> 00:22:18.281
They have no idea about the psyche.

00:22:18.281 --> 00:22:23.622
They don't know that psyche also has another
side, which is the right side, which is the

00:22:23.622 --> 00:22:24.622
ego.

00:22:24.622 --> 00:22:26.322
They can be very dangerously placed - person
like Freud.

00:22:26.322 --> 00:22:29.041
I don't know how people believe in him.

00:22:29.041 --> 00:22:31.142
In England, there are so many Freudians.

00:22:31.142 --> 00:22:35.542
I am surprised because I used to think that
at least English are the wisest among all

00:22:35.542 --> 00:22:37.622
the Europeans.

00:22:37.622 --> 00:22:43.512
But more than the place where he was born
and worked out in Vienna, there are more in

00:22:43.512 --> 00:22:44.512
England.

00:22:44.512 --> 00:22:47.992
It is most surprising, what has happened to
our wisdom.

00:22:47.992 --> 00:22:52.092
Even logically we can see that he was a hopeless
case.

00:22:52.092 --> 00:22:56.342
First of all, he had bad relations with his
mother.

00:22:56.342 --> 00:22:57.342
Can you imagine?

00:22:57.342 --> 00:22:58.342
He had no sublimity of any kind.

00:22:58.342 --> 00:22:59.342
He was worse than an animal.

00:22:59.342 --> 00:23:03.992
And secondly that he died of cancer in such
a miserable condition.

00:23:03.992 --> 00:23:06.392
And he was nothing but a miserable personality.

00:23:06.392 --> 00:23:15.202
How can you follow a man like that blindfolded
because he suggested that you are a sex point.

00:23:15.202 --> 00:23:16.742
All your relations are based on sex.

00:23:16.742 --> 00:23:17.742
There is nothing sublime.

00:23:17.742 --> 00:23:19.482
Now see where is the sex point.

00:23:19.482 --> 00:23:24.822
It is the last - here there is the red - and
here resides the innocence.

00:23:24.822 --> 00:23:31.031
This first center, which is the innocence
within us, is the child within us, is looking

00:23:31.031 --> 00:23:33.192
after the Mother Kundalini that you have.

00:23:33.192 --> 00:23:34.962
She is your Mother.

00:23:34.962 --> 00:23:38.902
Everybody has their own Mother settled down
in their sacrum bone, so sweetly, waiting

00:23:38.902 --> 00:23:40.872
for an opportunity to get this realization.

00:23:40.872 --> 00:23:46.462
She is going to give you your second birth
and she is going to work it out and this innocence

00:23:46.462 --> 00:23:52.652
of yours which you may kill any amount, it's
still there and they attack that innocence.

00:23:52.652 --> 00:23:57.512
Today I find in all the western countries
there is a big attack coming on their innocence,

00:23:57.512 --> 00:23:58.592
on the children.

00:23:58.592 --> 00:24:04.182
They do not understand that there is - sex
has nothing to do with your evolution.

00:24:04.182 --> 00:24:06.332
It is not important for your evolution.

00:24:06.332 --> 00:24:12.022
Of course a married sex which is a sensible
sex, which has a sanction with the collective,

00:24:12.022 --> 00:24:16.041
is very important, no doubt, for the society
and everything.

00:24:16.041 --> 00:24:19.781
But here if you play about with your sex,
it's a dangerous game.

00:24:19.781 --> 00:24:25.532
It gives you all kinds of diseases; it gives
you impotency, all sorts of other problems

00:24:25.532 --> 00:24:32.772
and worst of all, insecurity in the whole
atmosphere especially for the children.

00:24:32.772 --> 00:24:33.772
This is what it is.

00:24:33.772 --> 00:24:36.671
We have not been able to use our brains.

00:24:36.671 --> 00:24:37.692
Use your brains.

00:24:37.692 --> 00:24:40.302
God has given you brains, come to logical
conclusion.

00:24:40.302 --> 00:24:43.612
Like the Mayor yesterday asked me, "What do
you do with them?"

00:24:43.612 --> 00:24:46.592
I said, "First I will bring them to logical
conclusion."

00:24:46.592 --> 00:24:49.122
See what should we expect.

00:24:49.122 --> 00:24:56.772
We have known that Christ has said that, it
is written, "Thou shall not commit adultery."

00:24:56.772 --> 00:24:59.642
I say, "Thou shall not have adulterous eyes."

00:24:59.642 --> 00:25:04.212
Are we Christians aware of these warnings?

00:25:04.212 --> 00:25:08.602
Not to have adulterous eyes, just the opposite
we have.

00:25:08.602 --> 00:25:11.171
So that the eyes should be clean.

00:25:11.171 --> 00:25:15.342
There should be no lust in our eyes.

00:25:15.342 --> 00:25:19.582
It is to be at that point, not at the eye
level, not at the brain level.

00:25:19.582 --> 00:25:24.592
It is at that point and it should reside there.

00:25:24.592 --> 00:25:30.262
There is placed your innocence, because innocence
guards you against all wrong doings, all wrong

00:25:30.262 --> 00:25:35.112
things that you do with your sex, and that's
how you get into troubles and you have problems.

00:25:35.112 --> 00:25:43.242
Yesterday we had people there, many people
came and as the radio fellow has told me that

00:25:43.242 --> 00:25:45.752
you better talk about how you cure people.

00:25:45.752 --> 00:25:47.772
They will be very much interested.

00:25:47.772 --> 00:25:52.732
I told them all how it happens and we did
cure so many people there, of many problems

00:25:52.732 --> 00:26:01.522
and so many things can be cured and if you
want , you can get My tape to know about them,

00:26:01.522 --> 00:26:04.142
how it happens and what chakras give you this.

00:26:04.142 --> 00:26:07.762
But in short I'll tell you how we develop
problems within ourselves.

00:26:07.762 --> 00:26:14.862
Now one thing I would say, that when I am
discussing this, human mind is so funny that

00:26:14.862 --> 00:26:16.962
immediately they start reflecting upon themselves.

00:26:16.962 --> 00:26:18.982
Firstly they will feel guilty.

00:26:18.982 --> 00:26:21.012
"Oh, I have done this".

00:26:21.012 --> 00:26:24.522
Immediately they will start thinking that,
"I have got cancer," or, "I have got leukemia,"

00:26:24.522 --> 00:26:25.822
or "I have got that."

00:26:25.822 --> 00:26:29.672
So if I tell you about the symptoms, it can
be very critical.

00:26:29.672 --> 00:26:33.562
There is a very interesting book I read long
time back when I was a child, "Three Men in

00:26:33.562 --> 00:26:34.562
a Boat."

00:26:34.562 --> 00:26:36.332
I am sure all of you must have read it.

00:26:36.332 --> 00:26:37.682
It's a very interesting one.

00:26:37.682 --> 00:26:46.312
In that a character of one gentleman who said
that never read Materia Medica, the book about

00:26:46.312 --> 00:26:47.312
medicine.

00:26:47.312 --> 00:26:57.212
Once he read it and he thought he had every
disease, every disease except for housewife's

00:26:57.212 --> 00:27:04.082
knee and the doctor was amazed when he told
he has this disease, he has that disease.

00:27:04.082 --> 00:27:06.161
He said, "Why not a housewife's knee?"

00:27:06.161 --> 00:27:08.862
He said, "Because I am not a housewife."

00:27:08.862 --> 00:27:12.921
Otherwise he had practically every disease
and he wanted a medicine for that.

00:27:12.921 --> 00:27:17.182
doctor was - that time doctors were wiser
I think, he didn't want to take money out

00:27:17.182 --> 00:27:24.682
of him - so he said, "All right, I have given
you the medicine but you have to take it when

00:27:24.682 --> 00:27:25.682
you go away from here.

00:27:25.682 --> 00:27:30.192
Go to your bedroom and then you can take this
medicine."

00:27:30.192 --> 00:27:36.482
He went home and opened that and there was
nothing but a paper, and on the paper it was

00:27:36.482 --> 00:27:40.921
written, "You are the greatest fool I have
ever come across.

00:27:40.921 --> 00:27:46.952
Never read Materia Medica again and you are
absolutely healthy."

00:27:46.952 --> 00:27:52.232
So when you start telling them how the diseases
are caused, also people can start thinking,

00:27:52.232 --> 00:27:54.322
"Oh, I must be having this trouble and that
trouble."

00:27:54.322 --> 00:27:55.332
Nothing of the kind.

00:27:55.332 --> 00:27:57.322
Please don't think like that.

00:27:57.322 --> 00:28:02.712
I am just telling you because you should not
go into it again and it should not happen

00:28:02.712 --> 00:28:04.602
to you in future, not in the past.

00:28:04.602 --> 00:28:07.562
And those who have had problems also can be
cured.

00:28:07.562 --> 00:28:08.562
It's not difficult.

00:28:08.562 --> 00:28:09.882
It can be cured.

00:28:09.882 --> 00:28:13.031
When you get your enlightenment, you can cure
people.

00:28:13.031 --> 00:28:14.892
You can also cure.

00:28:14.892 --> 00:28:16.281
It's not difficult.

00:28:16.281 --> 00:28:20.153
So, now we start from the imbalances that
we have.

00:28:20.153 --> 00:28:24.612
For example, a human being has another funny
habit - is to go to extremes.

00:28:24.612 --> 00:28:32.322
If you tell him, now in the Newspapers or,
say, in the TV it appears that your legs should

00:28:32.322 --> 00:28:39.122
be like this, the measurement of the legs
appear, or the measurement of the body appears,

00:28:39.122 --> 00:28:45.192
all the ladies will try to be that, to become
like the form that is given.

00:28:45.192 --> 00:28:46.192
But why?

00:28:46.192 --> 00:28:51.452
It is, it might be some sort of an enterprise
that people are trying to sell something just

00:28:51.452 --> 00:28:57.102
to make you thin or fat or whatever it is
and that's why they are publishing these things.

00:28:57.102 --> 00:28:58.562
Why just you go into it headlong?

00:28:58.562 --> 00:29:01.182
May not be required at all for you.

00:29:01.182 --> 00:29:08.082
Now when they do it, they do it so much, so
much overdo it that they develop really the

00:29:08.082 --> 00:29:12.541
problems which never existed in them .They
were normal people and suddenly they become

00:29:12.541 --> 00:29:13.541
sick people.

00:29:13.541 --> 00:29:17.822
So in this way, we have so many extremes we
go to.

00:29:17.822 --> 00:29:24.062
For example, we are people who are right-sided
and left-sided as you can see here, the people

00:29:24.062 --> 00:29:30.362
who are emotionally very rich and who go to
the emotional extremes and the people who

00:29:30.362 --> 00:29:35.062
are more mentally rich and who go to the mental
side more.

00:29:35.062 --> 00:29:41.596
Those who have any desire and just work with
their desires and weep for it and they are

00:29:41.596 --> 00:29:47.092
the most unhappy and the most miserable people
- I couldn't get this and I couldn't get that

00:29:47.092 --> 00:29:49.032
- they are the left-sided people.

00:29:49.032 --> 00:29:51.952
The right-sided people are that "Why did he
get that?"

00:29:51.952 --> 00:29:54.722
"I must also get it."

00:29:54.722 --> 00:29:57.492
Such aggressive people are right-sided.

00:29:57.492 --> 00:30:01.412
Now the people who are on the left hand side
think of their past, "I was so very happy.

00:30:01.412 --> 00:30:04.732
Now I have married this wretched man and I
am very weak."

00:30:04.732 --> 00:30:09.222
The man will say, "I have married this wretched
woman," or some sort of a thing.

00:30:09.222 --> 00:30:12.712
They go on worrying about themselves for nothing
at all and making themselves miserable.

00:30:12.712 --> 00:30:14.532
So, we have two types of people.

00:30:14.532 --> 00:30:17.592
The another, one extreme case we can say,
is Hitler.

00:30:17.592 --> 00:30:19.252
Hitler was the one who was so aggressive.

00:30:19.252 --> 00:30:20.682
He used his aggressive policies.

00:30:20.682 --> 00:30:28.912
He got people who were dead who were aggressive
and used them to entice, to become aggressive.

00:30:28.912 --> 00:30:29.912
They could not see through.

00:30:29.912 --> 00:30:35.102
They could not understand that they are not
a special race and they became such racists

00:30:35.102 --> 00:30:39.852
which one can't understand with Human understanding
that how can there be a race superiority when

00:30:39.852 --> 00:30:41.832
God has created all of us.

00:30:41.832 --> 00:30:42.832
It's nonsense.

00:30:42.832 --> 00:30:43.832
It's absolute nonsense.

00:30:43.832 --> 00:30:45.472
It has no meaning, no basis.

00:30:45.472 --> 00:30:46.472
It's not natural.

00:30:46.472 --> 00:30:50.592
God has created everybody separately in a
different way but this kind of a thing comes

00:30:50.592 --> 00:30:51.592
into the mind.

00:30:51.592 --> 00:30:57.032
Then you are identified with certain ideas
on the right hand side that you are an aggressive

00:30:57.032 --> 00:30:58.032
person.

00:30:58.032 --> 00:31:00.892
On the left hand side, as I told you, a person
makes himself miserable because he thinks

00:31:00.892 --> 00:31:06.122
of the past, but on the right hand side, the
people make others miserable and aggressive

00:31:06.122 --> 00:31:07.122
sort of.

00:31:07.122 --> 00:31:08.291
Both sides are wrong.

00:31:08.291 --> 00:31:12.262
You have to be in the center, neither in the
future, nor in the past.

00:31:12.262 --> 00:31:14.411
So how to be in the center is the problem.

00:31:14.411 --> 00:31:16.522
By saying it or by brain-washing it, it cannot
happen.

00:31:16.522 --> 00:31:20.392
For that the Kundalini has to rise but you
have to keep the balance.

00:31:20.392 --> 00:31:23.732
You shouldn't go to the extreme of anything.

00:31:23.732 --> 00:31:28.832
You should not become identified or clubbed
with something which is not normal.

00:31:28.832 --> 00:31:32.332
We should treat it with normalcy about it.

00:31:32.332 --> 00:31:39.412
Like if you ask a person now, "You have to
do Hatha Yoga" There is a new system that

00:31:39.412 --> 00:31:43.031
has started, Hatha Yoga, without knowing what
this Hatha Yoga is.

00:31:43.031 --> 00:31:44.031
What was the basis of Hatha Yoga?

00:31:44.031 --> 00:31:46.902
There are Ashtangas and all these things have
to be done.

00:31:46.902 --> 00:31:51.962
I have seen people doing only that little
part of it, the Vayayama, which is so indiscriminate,

00:31:51.962 --> 00:31:55.372
which has no sense as to what chakras are
catching, where is the Kundalini, what is

00:31:55.372 --> 00:31:56.372
the problem.

00:31:56.372 --> 00:32:02.142
Such people can develop heart problems, tremendous
heart problems they can develop, and they

00:32:02.142 --> 00:32:08.102
can be extremely negative people because though
they appear to be very positive, they can

00:32:08.102 --> 00:32:09.352
be very, very dry.

00:32:09.352 --> 00:32:10.401
They can develop divorces.

00:32:10.401 --> 00:32:12.151
They can be very aggressive.

00:32:12.151 --> 00:32:15.671
A time will come when they will have no emotions.

00:32:15.671 --> 00:32:18.082
Even when their own child dies, they will
not feel it.

00:32:18.082 --> 00:32:20.372
They can be very, very dry.

00:32:20.372 --> 00:32:23.442
Now we don't see that dryness in the back.

00:32:23.442 --> 00:32:27.362
We do not see that that we are not feeling
the emotions of another person.

00:32:27.362 --> 00:32:32.892
We do not think that that is important.

00:32:32.892 --> 00:32:35.382
Left-sided people are the other way round,
as I told you.

00:32:35.382 --> 00:32:40.342
But when they go to the extreme, first they
go into their subconscious.

00:32:40.342 --> 00:32:44.391
In this they see what had happened and they
think of their previous lives and all that

00:32:44.391 --> 00:32:48.592
and then they can go into the collective sub-conscious
if they go on pressing it too much.

00:32:48.592 --> 00:32:52.482
Or some of the people who are interested in
their purse, all such base things, can entice

00:32:52.482 --> 00:32:58.192
them, can hypnotize them, completely hypnotize
them and push them on to the left side.

00:32:58.192 --> 00:33:02.312
Now cancer develops on the left side.

00:33:02.312 --> 00:33:05.572
Leukemia develops from the left side.

00:33:05.572 --> 00:33:07.252
Multiple sclerosis develops from the left
side.

00:33:07.252 --> 00:33:14.102
I haven't seen one patient who has come to
me, who is having cancer, having leukemia

00:33:14.102 --> 00:33:19.671
or multiple sclerosis who is a right-sided
person.

00:33:19.671 --> 00:33:27.271
And ultimately they can be epileptic, or they
can become lunatic or schizophrenic.

00:33:27.271 --> 00:33:29.432
All those things can happen to them.

00:33:29.432 --> 00:33:34.212
The right-sided person, on the contrary, will
get a heart attack.

00:33:34.212 --> 00:33:35.822
He'll get a heart attack.

00:33:35.822 --> 00:33:39.442
Definitely he'll get a heart attack, if he
goes too much with it.

00:33:39.442 --> 00:33:43.612
But first of all he might develop a liver,
very bad liver, hot temper with it.

00:33:43.612 --> 00:33:47.421
He may develop a pancreas trouble that could
be the diabetes.

00:33:47.421 --> 00:33:53.322
He could develop the spleen trouble which
could be a kind of a leukemia which comes

00:33:53.322 --> 00:34:01.222
out of speediness but it has to triggered
by the left side so it is between the - first

00:34:01.222 --> 00:34:06.662
the anemia and all that will happen and ultimately
he can get leukemia after that.

00:34:06.662 --> 00:34:12.842
And many children also become patients of
leukemia because their parents are speedy.

00:34:12.842 --> 00:34:19.932
Extremely speedy people get leukemia because
they are all the time acting on emergency.

00:34:19.932 --> 00:34:23.622
Simultaneously, they are working on various
things like, you are driving, you are eating,

00:34:23.622 --> 00:34:26.342
you are listening to the radio - horrid news.

00:34:26.342 --> 00:34:31.291
Early in the morning you see in the newspaper,
all horrid thing are there.

00:34:31.291 --> 00:34:32.902
They will never give a good news.

00:34:32.902 --> 00:34:33.902
You'll be amazed.

00:34:33.902 --> 00:34:37.362
We have been trying to tell people that we
have found out solutions to many things - please

00:34:37.362 --> 00:34:42.041
publish at least one line, half a line - but
they would not.

00:34:42.041 --> 00:34:45.862
But if there is a calamity somewhere, a horrible
thing happened, early in the morning, you

00:34:45.862 --> 00:34:48.911
open the newspaper, it's the only thing that
is talked of.

00:34:48.911 --> 00:34:51.912
You become so much upset that emergencies
that...

00:34:51.912 --> 00:34:56.302
Then you have your breakfast, you have to
catch the train, you have to rush up, you

00:34:56.302 --> 00:34:59.902
rush up, then you find that your train is
delayed, you start shouting.

00:34:59.902 --> 00:35:01.572
Specially you all get worked up.

00:35:01.572 --> 00:35:05.332
Ultimately what happens is that your spleen
goes out of gear.

00:35:05.332 --> 00:35:06.332
It becomes crazy.

00:35:06.332 --> 00:35:11.442
When it becomes crazy - it's a speedometer
- it controls our speed and you become so

00:35:11.442 --> 00:35:18.042
speedy that nothing can fit into you and the
speed of the production of red blood corpuscles

00:35:18.042 --> 00:35:20.312
is so much increased that they become malignant.

00:35:20.312 --> 00:35:25.031
But of course the triggering, as I said, comes
from the left side.

00:35:25.031 --> 00:35:35.162
So sometimes the right side can create a condition
for the left side to act - can also be just

00:35:35.162 --> 00:35:36.902
the left side can work out.

00:35:36.902 --> 00:35:46.392
If a person is affected, say, by a position,
if he lives near a funeral place or some place

00:35:46.392 --> 00:35:53.862
where there is a cemetery or in the churches
also you have all the dead bodies there - I

00:35:53.862 --> 00:35:55.292
mean it's something I can't understand.

00:35:55.292 --> 00:35:56.781
People don't know about that.

00:35:56.781 --> 00:36:00.382
Why to put in the churches, the dead bodies?

00:36:00.382 --> 00:36:06.172
I mean, normally, anybody who dies must be
cremated except for the realized souls.

00:36:06.172 --> 00:36:08.422
Realized souls are to be buried.

00:36:08.422 --> 00:36:12.702
It's a simple thing, because they give fragrance
to the Mother Earth, they give fragrance to

00:36:12.702 --> 00:36:13.702
everyone.

00:36:13.702 --> 00:36:18.552
But if you bury a person who is not a realized
soul - supposing he is an evil genius - you

00:36:18.552 --> 00:36:21.211
know about this that the souls wander about.

00:36:21.211 --> 00:36:25.471
And I have lived, since I have come to London,
always near a church.

00:36:25.471 --> 00:36:30.132
I have found all these souls coming up in
the night and they are horrible things and

00:36:30.132 --> 00:36:31.132
we walk over them.

00:36:31.132 --> 00:36:33.142
They are sleeping there and we trod on them.

00:36:33.142 --> 00:36:34.472
It's a wrong thing.

00:36:34.472 --> 00:36:39.362
People have no idea as to how to deal with
the dead and that's how people have also created

00:36:39.362 --> 00:36:40.412
a double problem.

00:36:40.412 --> 00:36:45.112
The cemetery is in the city.

00:36:45.112 --> 00:36:48.192
The center of the city, there will be a cemetery.

00:36:48.192 --> 00:36:49.312
All children are going there.

00:36:49.312 --> 00:36:50.312
Everybody is going there.

00:36:50.312 --> 00:36:52.622
Pregnant women are going there and these busy
bodies can attack you.

00:36:52.622 --> 00:36:53.622
It's a fact.

00:36:53.622 --> 00:36:54.622
They exist.

00:36:54.622 --> 00:36:55.622
There is no doubt about it.

00:36:55.622 --> 00:37:02.392
Even the doctors say that there are proteins
which they call as Protein 52 and Protein

00:37:02.392 --> 00:37:08.192
58, like that, and these are the proteins
which invade us, our being by which cancer

00:37:08.192 --> 00:37:09.192
is triggered.

00:37:09.192 --> 00:37:13.622
And what they say that this comes to us from
an area which is built within us since our

00:37:13.622 --> 00:37:15.402
creation, means from collective sub-conscious.

00:37:15.402 --> 00:37:20.052
But, I mean, they cannot put it together as
I am putting it because they see things from

00:37:20.052 --> 00:37:21.942
outside (and) I see things from inside.

00:37:21.942 --> 00:37:26.712
Now when I tell about this, people don't like
it but it's a fact.

00:37:26.712 --> 00:37:28.912
You should not play about with spirits.

00:37:28.912 --> 00:37:32.152
These spiritualists, these charismatics and
this sect and that sect..., Penticostals are

00:37:32.152 --> 00:37:37.682
nothing but possessions and these possessions
can be horrible and most of the lunatics and

00:37:37.682 --> 00:37:41.172
all these people are with possessions.

00:37:41.172 --> 00:37:42.952
You must have seen a woman walking.

00:37:42.952 --> 00:37:44.072
Suddenly she becomes blank.

00:37:44.072 --> 00:37:46.312
Her eyes are open, nothing wrong with her.

00:37:46.312 --> 00:37:47.312
Doctors can't cure.

00:37:47.312 --> 00:37:51.752
She can be easily cured if you can remove
the possession from her.

00:37:51.752 --> 00:37:58.512
These are all horrible things, which can ruin
your life and you do not understand why doctors

00:37:58.512 --> 00:38:01.512
cannot understand because they don't understand
that there can be spirits.

00:38:01.512 --> 00:38:02.832
They don't want to accept it.

00:38:02.832 --> 00:38:07.582
You can't see the spirit until and unless
you become a Spirit.

00:38:07.582 --> 00:38:13.722
That is the problem, is that in English language
there are three meanings of the word spirit.

00:38:13.722 --> 00:38:16.502
One is the Spirit that is Atma.

00:38:16.502 --> 00:38:23.422
Another is the spirit which is dead and the
one that you drink is also spirit.

00:38:23.422 --> 00:38:27.162
So you can understand how can you have three
words, which are just opposite each other

00:38:27.162 --> 00:38:28.162
meaning the same?

00:38:28.162 --> 00:38:35.701
Now I am praying (to) the Spirit which is
in the heart, which is the reflection of God

00:38:35.701 --> 00:38:36.862
almighty.

00:38:36.862 --> 00:38:43.682
But this Spirit, unless and until it is awakened,
no use talking about it.

00:38:43.682 --> 00:38:50.612
Better have it done so that you know how beautiful
you are, how God has created you with such

00:38:50.612 --> 00:38:52.802
beauty, care, and you are all there intact.

00:38:52.802 --> 00:38:53.802
Nothing is missing.

00:38:53.802 --> 00:38:55.032
You don't have to worry about it.

00:38:55.032 --> 00:38:57.142
You just don't have to think about it.

00:38:57.142 --> 00:38:58.772
"Oh, Mother, how can I be?

00:38:58.772 --> 00:39:00.332
I have done this.

00:39:00.332 --> 00:39:01.332
I have done that."

00:39:01.332 --> 00:39:02.332
Please don't think.

00:39:02.332 --> 00:39:04.822
First thing that I always say before starting
the program, before the demonstration of it

00:39:04.822 --> 00:39:09.282
or before the manifestation of it, that first
of all say in your heart of hearts, "Mother,

00:39:09.282 --> 00:39:10.802
I am not guilty."

00:39:10.802 --> 00:39:16.221
That's one thing, this idea that you are guilty,
is absurd.

00:39:16.221 --> 00:39:18.022
It has no meaning at all.

00:39:18.022 --> 00:39:22.942
It is not even a speck in that Ocean which
cleanses you.

00:39:22.942 --> 00:39:25.272
So you don't have to say that - that, "I am
guilty."

00:39:25.272 --> 00:39:29.961
Please, for heaven's sake, all of you have
to say that in your hearts before we start

00:39:29.961 --> 00:39:31.292
any program further.

00:39:31.292 --> 00:39:35.072
Because how can you be guilty?

00:39:35.072 --> 00:39:41.242
As He is the compassion - you can't imagine
what compassion He has.

00:39:41.242 --> 00:39:43.552
He is forgiving.

00:39:43.552 --> 00:39:46.642
He is complete forgiveness.

00:39:46.642 --> 00:39:51.682
At that time if you have to feel guilty, you
really insult His power of forgiveness.

00:39:51.682 --> 00:39:55.542
So we should not feel guilty about anything.

00:39:55.542 --> 00:39:56.552
Whatever has happened has happened.

00:39:56.552 --> 00:39:57.552
Forget the past, doesn't matter.

00:39:57.552 --> 00:40:01.782
It is a very important time, important moment
you have arrived.

00:40:01.782 --> 00:40:03.971
The time of resurrection has come.

00:40:03.971 --> 00:40:05.772
The time of blossom has come.

00:40:05.772 --> 00:40:07.122
You have to become the truth.

00:40:07.122 --> 00:40:11.542
It has to work out and it will work out.

00:40:11.542 --> 00:40:13.762
May God bless you all.

00:40:13.762 --> 00:40:17.632
I would request you, if you have any questions,
you can ask me questions.

00:40:17.632 --> 00:40:21.902
But don't ask irrelevant questions and, you
see, offensive questions.

00:40:21.902 --> 00:40:27.602
That's very wrong because, you see, I have
nothing to get out of you - nothing I tell

00:40:27.602 --> 00:40:32.422
you - except that little politics about it
that I am a Capitalist in the sense that I

00:40:32.422 --> 00:40:37.412
have all the powers within myself and I am
a Communist because I can't live without sharing

00:40:37.412 --> 00:40:38.412
it.

00:40:38.412 --> 00:40:42.711
That's the problem and that's why I am here
and so people should not ask questions which

00:40:42.711 --> 00:40:45.182
are offensive for nothing at all.

00:40:45.182 --> 00:40:46.862
If you want to get it, you can get it.

00:40:46.862 --> 00:40:50.142
I cannot force you as I have told you in the
very beginning.

00:40:50.142 --> 00:40:51.652
It cannot be forced.

00:40:51.652 --> 00:40:52.922
I cannot promise you.

00:40:52.922 --> 00:40:58.762
I am sure it will work out, if you little
bit co-operate with me.

00:40:58.762 --> 00:41:01.012
So be kind to yourself and be open.

00:41:01.012 --> 00:41:06.482
You need not have blind faith about me, not
at all, not at all, but you should be open

00:41:06.482 --> 00:41:07.482
to receive.

00:41:07.482 --> 00:41:08.482
If it works, well and good.

00:41:08.482 --> 00:41:11.222
If it doesn't work we'll see it the next time,
doesn't matter.

00:41:11.222 --> 00:41:18.221
I am going to be in London at least for three
years more.

00:41:18.221 --> 00:41:22.532
I hope so.

00:41:22.532 --> 00:41:29.711
May God bless you all.

00:41:29.711 --> 00:41:38.332
Now please ask me some questions.

00:41:38.332 --> 00:41:43.522
Q. When you say that spiritualists ....spirits
are wrong..is it wrong for someone who knows

00:41:43.522 --> 00:41:58.412
the secret to try and do something about it
....what is so wrong with it?

00:41:58.412 --> 00:42:06.191
Shri Mataji: You see the spirits are the dead
spirits, are the people who belong to another

00:42:06.191 --> 00:42:07.191
country.

00:42:07.191 --> 00:42:08.782
They belong to another state.

00:42:08.782 --> 00:42:09.782
All right?

00:42:09.782 --> 00:42:12.231
They are in the subconscious area.

00:42:12.231 --> 00:42:16.502
If you start allowing them to walk into our
lives, there will be many who will come around

00:42:16.502 --> 00:42:17.882
as immigrants, you see.

00:42:17.882 --> 00:42:23.742
And you don't know what they are up to and
they will attack you.

00:42:23.742 --> 00:42:30.002
Moreover, those people who are realized souls
or of higher nature never stay back.

00:42:30.002 --> 00:42:34.082
They know that this is over and we should
go back.

00:42:34.082 --> 00:42:38.762
Moreover, it is our responsibility also to
see that we do not trouble them.

00:42:38.762 --> 00:42:41.842
I mean, we have used them; they have lived
with us.

00:42:41.842 --> 00:42:43.842
Now we should give them their freedom.

00:42:43.842 --> 00:42:46.812
By keeping them around, we torture them.

00:42:46.812 --> 00:42:48.162
We trouble them.

00:42:48.162 --> 00:42:51.142
And sometimes they can be very, very troubled.

00:42:51.142 --> 00:42:53.812
Even if they are good people, we really trouble
them.

00:42:53.812 --> 00:42:54.812
Let them go.

00:42:54.812 --> 00:42:59.932
That's not the time that they should be here
and they will be back again.

00:42:59.932 --> 00:43:00.932
Why trouble them?

00:43:00.932 --> 00:43:03.292
It is because you are identified with them.

00:43:03.292 --> 00:43:08.042
Now about sickness, people say that for sickness,
I have known people who are spiritualists,

00:43:08.042 --> 00:43:09.042
who try to cure.

00:43:09.042 --> 00:43:12.862
But what they do is to remove one spirit and
put another one into it.

00:43:12.862 --> 00:43:19.302
If a person, say, he is a person who is wasting
money, say in horse riding, so if you remove

00:43:19.302 --> 00:43:21.442
him from there, he'll become an alcoholic.

00:43:21.442 --> 00:43:23.592
If not, he'll start beating his wife.

00:43:23.592 --> 00:43:25.532
Because there is no transformation, you see.

00:43:25.532 --> 00:43:30.731
There is a gap always if you ....so it is
better not to have some sort of a screw there

00:43:30.731 --> 00:43:33.782
which is always to be replaced by something
else.

00:43:33.782 --> 00:43:39.292
So these spiritualists, also those who try
to heal, are just giving you relief in the

00:43:39.292 --> 00:43:40.292
physical being.

00:43:40.292 --> 00:43:41.292
Physical being is not so important.

00:43:41.292 --> 00:43:43.942
It is part of it but we are not only physical
beings.

00:43:43.942 --> 00:43:46.682
We are also mental beings and emotional beings.

00:43:46.682 --> 00:43:51.842
If you try to be only physical being, do everything
only for the physical side, then you forget

00:43:51.842 --> 00:43:52.842
the spirit.

00:43:52.842 --> 00:43:54.982
And the spirits get angry with you.

00:43:54.982 --> 00:44:00.231
So you are three of these things which are
to be integrated through your spiritual ascent.

00:44:00.231 --> 00:44:01.231
All right?

00:44:01.231 --> 00:44:08.812
So that's why in any case that kind of a work
is of no help in any way to ask because ultimately

00:44:08.812 --> 00:44:13.662
we have to see to the general good of everyone
.

00:44:13.662 --> 00:44:18.422
I have seen spiritualists who have been acting
as spiritualist end up their lives very miserably,

00:44:18.422 --> 00:44:20.242
most of them.

00:44:20.242 --> 00:44:26.032
Not only that but whenever they are in a program
you get tremendous heat from them.

00:44:26.032 --> 00:44:27.992
All those people who have tried such tricks...

00:44:27.992 --> 00:44:31.122
I'll give you a very good example of Doctor
[unclear: Lang or Land Side B 11:35], who

00:44:31.122 --> 00:44:35.032
was, who died - late Doctor [Unclear: Land
or Lang] International Curative Centre was

00:44:35.032 --> 00:44:37.842
in London, I don't know if it is still existing
or not.

00:44:37.842 --> 00:44:42.612
I came to know about it because so many people
in India suffered from that curative center.

00:44:42.612 --> 00:44:43.782
And they came to me.

00:44:43.782 --> 00:44:44.782
I had no idea.

00:44:44.782 --> 00:44:49.702
Now this gentleman died long time back and
his spirit entered into a soldier, not into

00:44:49.702 --> 00:44:51.892
his son, but to a soldier in Vietnam or something.

00:44:51.892 --> 00:44:57.072
And this soldier, now they write all this
story, I mean they are very frank and honest

00:44:57.072 --> 00:44:59.002
- I must say they are not hiding anything.

00:44:59.002 --> 00:45:04.752
So this gentleman came to England and told
the son that I am the father and he told him

00:45:04.752 --> 00:45:08.441
secrets where things are and all that and
he convinced him that he was the father.

00:45:08.441 --> 00:45:13.862
He said that you open a clinic with this name
- Late Doctor [Unclear: Land or Lang] International

00:45:13.862 --> 00:45:14.862
Curative Centre.

00:45:14.862 --> 00:45:22.172
Now what they used to do, you see, he got
hold of many doctors who were sort of unhappy

00:45:22.172 --> 00:45:25.322
or some sort of thing or those who were lingering
behind.

00:45:25.322 --> 00:45:30.792
So, he used those spirits and what he did
by using those spirits, he used to write a

00:45:30.792 --> 00:45:35.971
letter, which I have seen myself, in many
cases, that at this time, at this hour, we

00:45:35.971 --> 00:45:37.382
will enter into your body.

00:45:37.382 --> 00:45:38.792
I mean, they frankly told.

00:45:38.792 --> 00:45:43.592
They didn't say that "We are going to do anything
divine, and we'll enter into your body and

00:45:43.592 --> 00:45:47.382
when we enter into your body, then what will
happen, that you'll start shaking.

00:45:47.382 --> 00:45:48.382
Don't be worried.

00:45:48.382 --> 00:45:52.642
It is we who are in you, and once it happens,"
- it would happen after three months or four

00:45:52.642 --> 00:45:56.481
months but they would give exact timing - "and
then you'll feel better."

00:45:56.481 --> 00:46:00.332
Now these people who came to me suffered from
tremendous nervous trouble.

00:46:00.332 --> 00:46:05.832
And out of all these who came, even one percent
I could not cure - one percent.

00:46:05.832 --> 00:46:07.822
They were such gone cases.

00:46:07.822 --> 00:46:13.372
They had a miserable old age and I still know
of a lady; she just lays down in her bed and

00:46:13.372 --> 00:46:17.441
goes into tremors and things and nobody can
help her.

00:46:17.441 --> 00:46:21.272
I haven't got time to pay so much attention
to one individual only.

00:46:21.272 --> 00:46:23.042
So it's a miserable case.

00:46:23.042 --> 00:46:26.492
Every time I go there, she meets me.

00:46:26.492 --> 00:46:27.652
I put her right.

00:46:27.652 --> 00:46:31.152
Again she goes back to her bed (and) again
she gets ill.

00:46:31.152 --> 00:46:35.802
It's a very long process.

00:46:35.802 --> 00:46:40.242
I am not here to cure you, I must tell you
very frankly, but to give you realization.

00:46:40.242 --> 00:46:43.242
But as a by-product of that, you all get cured.

00:46:43.242 --> 00:46:44.242
That's it.

00:46:44.242 --> 00:46:46.654
Just as a by- product of that, you get cured.

00:46:46.654 --> 00:46:50.112
Moreover, you must understand that God is
the source of all common sense.

00:46:50.112 --> 00:46:55.402
He will only cure such lamps which will be
His lights later on because we don't look

00:46:55.402 --> 00:46:57.772
after lamps which are gone cases.

00:46:57.772 --> 00:46:59.092
So they can be born again.

00:46:59.092 --> 00:47:05.112
But God looks after those people who can give
His light to all.

00:47:05.112 --> 00:47:06.742
Of course, many people get cured.

00:47:06.742 --> 00:47:11.222
I have seen in London, the first wave of Sahaja
Yoga started - we have thousands of them they

00:47:11.222 --> 00:47:12.222
got cured.

00:47:12.222 --> 00:47:16.342
But out of them very few really took up Sahaja
Yoga and helped others.

00:47:16.342 --> 00:47:17.342
They just forgot.

00:47:17.342 --> 00:47:18.772
Of course, they have tremendous respect for
Me.

00:47:18.772 --> 00:47:21.721
When I go to India; they all fill the hall
and all that is there.

00:47:21.721 --> 00:47:23.002
But they are doing nothing for Sahaja Yoga.

00:47:23.002 --> 00:47:26.172
They are not doing anything curing for others.

00:47:26.172 --> 00:47:27.582
They are not raising their Kundalini.

00:47:27.582 --> 00:47:29.481
They are not giving realization.

00:47:29.481 --> 00:47:35.132
It's really... sometimes I feel that so many
people have been cured, so much God has done

00:47:35.132 --> 00:47:39.721
for them, but they don't understand why God
has done it for them . It is to give it to

00:47:39.721 --> 00:47:40.721
others.

00:47:40.721 --> 00:47:41.721
You don't have to do so much for Sahaja Yoga.

00:47:41.721 --> 00:47:42.992
You don't have to pay a single pi [short form
of Paise].

00:47:42.992 --> 00:47:44.122
Nothing is needed.

00:47:44.122 --> 00:47:46.162
Only thing is, God has given you this power.

00:47:46.162 --> 00:47:47.642
All right, just give it to others.

00:47:47.642 --> 00:47:48.642
That's all.

00:47:48.642 --> 00:47:49.642
It's very simple.

00:47:49.642 --> 00:47:51.481
And you feel so happy.

00:47:51.481 --> 00:47:55.502
You are so employed by God that you do not
feel bored at all.

00:47:55.502 --> 00:47:56.752
It's such a wonderful thing.

00:47:56.752 --> 00:48:01.022
But one must accept that if He has been kind
to us we have to be kind to others.

00:48:01.022 --> 00:48:04.802
It will just automatically work, no doubt.

00:48:04.802 --> 00:48:05.882
It works.

00:48:05.882 --> 00:48:09.451
I know people get cured, no doubt about it.

00:48:09.451 --> 00:48:10.992
Any other question please?

00:48:10.992 --> 00:48:14.072
Yes, please - little loudly....can you say
loudly, please?

00:48:14.072 --> 00:48:23.782
Q. Why is the picture sitting on the table
lying next to you?

00:48:23.782 --> 00:48:28.252
Shri Mataji: Why?

00:48:28.252 --> 00:48:31.442
You don't like it?

00:48:31.442 --> 00:48:40.572
It's a question really something I can't understand.

00:48:40.572 --> 00:48:47.142
You see, if I am something, if this picture
is My true picture, then why not have it?

00:48:47.142 --> 00:48:49.524
All the pictures you have of Christ are not
His own.

00:48:49.524 --> 00:48:56.572
Very few people have seen Him and also there
is no one who has taken His picture.

00:48:56.572 --> 00:48:59.422
Actually, when I see the pictures of Christ
I get a shock.

00:48:59.422 --> 00:49:01.201
I said, "How can this be Christ?"

00:49:01.201 --> 00:49:06.042
I mean, this miserable creature cannot be
Christ at all, but you don't mind having all

00:49:06.042 --> 00:49:07.052
these things around.

00:49:07.052 --> 00:49:13.022
Even the cross that you have can be horrible,
made of plastic, made of this, made of that.

00:49:13.022 --> 00:49:15.682
That gives horrible vibrations to you.

00:49:15.682 --> 00:49:17.471
You don't know anything about it.

00:49:17.471 --> 00:49:23.902
With this picture, you'll be surprised, the
person who first got realization got through

00:49:23.902 --> 00:49:24.902
this picture.

00:49:24.902 --> 00:49:26.792
In this picture there are vibrations.

00:49:26.792 --> 00:49:30.642
When you will get realized, you will know
that only this picture has that vibration

00:49:30.642 --> 00:49:34.951
because the real thing it is - thank God that
science has given us the real thing.

00:49:34.951 --> 00:49:40.612
If there were cameras before, we would have
had pictures of all those great people.

00:49:40.612 --> 00:49:43.242
Because there were no photographs they said,
"Better not have any pictures."

00:49:43.242 --> 00:49:48.752
Because all the pictures were imaginary, done
by people who wanted to have some money.

00:49:48.752 --> 00:49:53.762
With this picture, many people have been cured.

00:49:53.762 --> 00:49:55.902
All right?

00:49:55.902 --> 00:49:58.242
Especially in Australia, a miracle happened.

00:49:58.242 --> 00:50:00.572
That's how media took me over.

00:50:00.572 --> 00:50:08.332
There was a lady, a friend of a very big journalist
and a businessman there who was in coma and

00:50:08.332 --> 00:50:15.332
doctors said she has got a brain trouble and
she cannot come back to her normal condition.

00:50:15.332 --> 00:50:19.532
There is a damage in her brain and she is
dying.

00:50:19.532 --> 00:50:23.072
Then everybody had given up hopes and there
was one Sahaja Yogini and she said, "All right,

00:50:23.072 --> 00:50:25.742
you just allow me to put this photograph under
her pillow."

00:50:25.742 --> 00:50:28.302
And you'll be surprised: she came to consciousness
next day.

00:50:28.302 --> 00:50:31.002
By the time I reached there, she was very
conscious.

00:50:31.002 --> 00:50:34.052
So all the media was there to receive me in
Australia.

00:50:34.052 --> 00:50:38.632
I was surprised because media is the last
which attends to anything that is real.

00:50:38.632 --> 00:50:42.662
I was Myself aghast to see them there.

00:50:42.662 --> 00:50:46.802
But it's one thing, no doubt, and it's really
true and it happened and now that woman is

00:50:46.802 --> 00:50:47.802
walking about.

00:50:47.802 --> 00:50:49.942
You can write to her and find out.

00:50:49.942 --> 00:50:53.592
So this is what it is.

00:50:53.592 --> 00:50:58.002
It's a very good thing that has happened that
we can take pictures now because I think,

00:50:58.002 --> 00:51:06.962
I cannot meet everyone in this world but they
can at least see my picture.

00:51:06.962 --> 00:51:08.972
People get cured by this picture.

00:51:08.972 --> 00:51:09.972
What's wrong?

00:51:09.972 --> 00:51:12.752
Supposing your picture was like that, I would
like to put it there.

00:51:12.752 --> 00:51:14.721
But is it like that?

00:51:14.721 --> 00:51:15.721
That's the point.

00:51:15.721 --> 00:51:17.392
You see some people say, "Why you are doing
it?"

00:51:17.392 --> 00:51:18.582
I say, "Better you do it.

00:51:18.582 --> 00:51:19.772
I would like to retire."

00:51:19.772 --> 00:51:21.912
Actually, today my husband was very angry
with me.

00:51:21.912 --> 00:51:23.812
He said, "Why are you there on Saturdays?

00:51:23.812 --> 00:51:24.812
Why don't you come?"

00:51:24.812 --> 00:51:27.232
I said, "Now it has been advertised too much.

00:51:27.232 --> 00:51:28.602
I just can't come."

00:51:28.602 --> 00:51:32.092
He is not, he wants me there for some purpose
and he was not very happy about it.

00:51:32.092 --> 00:51:35.432
So I would be very happy if you could sit
down here and do the job.

00:51:35.432 --> 00:51:36.432
You see, I'll be very happy.

00:51:36.432 --> 00:51:37.432
I'll retire.

00:51:37.432 --> 00:51:38.432
But you can't do it.

00:51:38.432 --> 00:51:41.742
And why to feel bad if I can do it?

00:51:41.742 --> 00:51:44.272
Because you can do many more things that I
cannot.

00:51:44.272 --> 00:51:49.622
For example, I can't drive, I don't know how
to write a check, I don't know anything that

00:51:49.622 --> 00:51:50.622
you know.

00:51:50.622 --> 00:51:51.932
So many things there are that I do not know.

00:51:51.932 --> 00:51:52.932
You'll be amazed.

00:51:52.932 --> 00:51:57.992
I am so simple that people can call me a rustic
woman because I don't know many things that

00:51:57.992 --> 00:51:59.152
you know.

00:51:59.152 --> 00:52:04.062
But I know one thing: that is awakening of
your Kundalini, and then another thing is

00:52:04.062 --> 00:52:17.451
that this photograph also knows you somehow.

00:52:17.451 --> 00:52:22.451
Yes please?

00:52:22.451 --> 00:52:33.632
Q; How did you discover such a quick way of
self realization?

00:52:33.632 --> 00:52:38.442
Shri Mataji: Must be something about Me, sir.

00:52:38.442 --> 00:52:40.082
You better find out.

00:52:40.082 --> 00:52:41.082
It's true.

00:52:41.082 --> 00:52:42.082
It's true.

00:52:42.082 --> 00:52:44.221
But something about Me, definitely.

00:52:44.221 --> 00:52:47.992
You see, whatever our education is, you have
come to us with wisdom and all that, it has

00:52:47.992 --> 00:52:51.692
come to us through other English writers and
western writers.

00:52:51.692 --> 00:52:58.221
But if you really go into the literature,
you will know that it is already prophesized.

00:52:58.221 --> 00:53:01.702
Even William Blake has prophesized absolutely
about Sahaja Yoga.

00:53:01.702 --> 00:53:07.132
He said that God of men [men of god?] will
become prophets and they will have powers

00:53:07.132 --> 00:53:09.412
to make others prophets.

00:53:09.412 --> 00:53:11.692
But who reads Blake?

00:53:11.692 --> 00:53:13.972
No one;they read Freud.

00:53:13.972 --> 00:53:20.191
He's described to such a detail about Sahaja
Yoga that sometimes I am amazed.

00:53:20.191 --> 00:53:24.952
No Indian seer has seen that what William
Blake has seen.

00:53:24.952 --> 00:53:32.362
But our mentality is funny because once he
had his exhibition; I went to see his exhibition

00:53:32.362 --> 00:53:35.032
and people were looking at nude women that
he had painted.

00:53:35.032 --> 00:53:36.032
He was innocent.

00:53:36.032 --> 00:53:40.922
He didn't paint any nudity; he just painted
women without any dress, just the body.

00:53:40.922 --> 00:53:43.582
But they were looking at the nude women.

00:53:43.582 --> 00:53:45.481
So, look at our mentality.

00:53:45.481 --> 00:53:53.132
Looking at William Blake also we praise him
because he has painted women without dress.

00:53:53.132 --> 00:53:54.662
He was innocent.

00:53:54.662 --> 00:53:55.662
It has to be done.

00:53:55.662 --> 00:53:57.772
The time has come.

00:53:57.772 --> 00:54:02.721
At the beginning of life, I know there were
hardly one or two people, but today is the

00:54:02.721 --> 00:54:07.112
time, a time where many have to become.

00:54:07.112 --> 00:54:11.912
As you know, on the tree of life there were
few flowers.

00:54:11.912 --> 00:54:18.092
Now there has to be many flowers because the
blossom time has come and it has to be simple.

00:54:18.092 --> 00:54:22.951
But supposing it is simple, must you not accept?

00:54:22.951 --> 00:54:26.711
It's like my grandmother saying, "I don't
believe you can go to moon.

00:54:26.711 --> 00:54:29.052
How can it be possible?"

00:54:29.052 --> 00:54:30.451
It's like that.

00:54:30.451 --> 00:54:32.332
It's a jet age.

00:54:32.332 --> 00:54:35.912
If there is speed outside, if the tree is
growing outside too much, something must have

00:54:35.912 --> 00:54:38.981
grown inside: the roots.

00:54:38.981 --> 00:54:43.481
And this is the knowledge of the roots which
you do not know, which you should know, how

00:54:43.481 --> 00:54:47.322
it has grown, what it is sucking.

00:54:47.322 --> 00:54:48.422
All right?

00:54:48.422 --> 00:54:50.242
If it is so, why not have it?

00:54:50.242 --> 00:54:53.492
I mean, if I say there's a diamond, will you
refuse it?

00:54:53.492 --> 00:54:56.201
You'll say, "All right, if it's diamond then
let us see."

00:54:56.201 --> 00:55:03.342
It's more than all the diamonds put together.

00:55:03.342 --> 00:55:05.532
It's true.

00:55:05.532 --> 00:55:14.542
It is very simple to understand if you see
God's point of view.

00:55:14.542 --> 00:55:17.792
This creation has to have a meaning.

00:55:17.792 --> 00:55:19.172
And you are going to give it the meaning.

00:55:19.172 --> 00:55:23.842
If it doesn't work out, this creation, it
is going to destroy, because human beings

00:55:23.842 --> 00:55:27.342
are going to be destroyed.

00:55:27.342 --> 00:55:29.022
You can see that.

00:55:29.022 --> 00:55:37.662
You can see around what is the situation is.

00:55:37.662 --> 00:56:25.742
Q: [Unclear Side B 22:57]
Shri Mataji: It's a little confused question

00:56:25.742 --> 00:56:33.062
because, you see... but I understand what
you are trying to say, that people are seeing

00:56:33.062 --> 00:56:36.242
it through now because they are intelligent.

00:56:36.242 --> 00:56:39.461
They are seeing through and it has reached
a certain culminating point, you see.

00:56:39.461 --> 00:56:45.431
All these philosophies have reached certain
culminating point and they are seeing that,

00:56:45.431 --> 00:56:46.431
what is the result.

00:56:46.431 --> 00:56:50.252
Now the time has come for them to see the
result of all their mental projections we

00:56:50.252 --> 00:56:51.862
have had about everything.

00:56:51.862 --> 00:56:54.951
So people are thinking that there must be
an answer to all this.

00:56:54.951 --> 00:56:59.262
Whatever we have done may have been little
wrong or something has been more linear.

00:56:59.262 --> 00:57:03.912
It is not expanding us and it is not giving
us what was promised to us.

00:57:03.912 --> 00:57:07.492
So they are thinking about it and they are
going down to find out the answers.

00:57:07.492 --> 00:57:09.272
That's why there is a seeking, no doubt.

00:57:09.272 --> 00:57:15.342
But it is also the plan that they should be
here, that they should be on this earth at

00:57:15.342 --> 00:57:16.342
this time.

00:57:16.342 --> 00:57:17.451
All, so many things have worked out.

00:57:17.451 --> 00:57:20.762
But the reason is that there is confusion
today.

00:57:20.762 --> 00:57:23.262
In this confusion only, you are going to find
it out.

00:57:23.262 --> 00:57:27.961
If you were not confused, if you were sure
that you are doing the right thing and you

00:57:27.961 --> 00:57:32.352
have done whatever is right which was before
this, then you would not have thought of it.

00:57:32.352 --> 00:57:37.912
But just now people are seeing that we are
relatively living: "This is also right.

00:57:37.912 --> 00:57:38.912
This is also right."

00:57:38.912 --> 00:57:39.912
How can that be?

00:57:39.912 --> 00:57:40.912
If right is one then it should be one.

00:57:40.912 --> 00:57:42.572
So people are thinking about it.

00:57:42.572 --> 00:57:43.572
They are seeking.

00:57:43.572 --> 00:57:45.282
In this seeking they might do mistakes.

00:57:45.282 --> 00:57:51.582
And people might do many mistakes like going
to wrong gurus, might spend money for it,

00:57:51.582 --> 00:57:55.731
may become bankrupts, might go to drugs, might
do this punk rock... all kinds of things.

00:57:55.731 --> 00:58:02.711
They are nothing but expression of that feeling
within that there is something beyond.

00:58:02.711 --> 00:58:07.342
It's true that this confusion has led to this
seeking.

00:58:07.342 --> 00:58:08.872
No doubt about it.

00:58:08.872 --> 00:58:10.112
Because they are all challenged.

00:58:10.112 --> 00:58:11.112
These philosophies are challenged.

00:58:11.112 --> 00:58:12.112
Everything is challenged.

00:58:12.112 --> 00:58:15.322
And people see that it has given no result.

00:58:15.322 --> 00:58:17.412
Our forefathers did the same; we are doing
the same.

00:58:17.412 --> 00:58:18.461
What's the use?

00:58:18.461 --> 00:58:20.471
We have to reach somewhere.

00:58:20.471 --> 00:58:26.512
For example, Jung has talked of universal
unconsciousness much before I came.

00:58:26.512 --> 00:58:30.951
They have prepared the stage for Sahaja Yoga,
I should say.

00:58:30.951 --> 00:58:33.451
All right?

00:58:33.451 --> 00:58:40.941
Q: [Unclear : something about another guru...

00:58:40.941 --> 00:58:44.681
Side B 25:51].

00:58:44.681 --> 00:58:50.902
Shri Mataji: Oh, now don't ask about them.

00:58:50.902 --> 00:58:53.092
What do you think about him?

00:58:53.092 --> 00:58:55.352
What have they done?

00:58:55.352 --> 00:59:00.492
What good have they done to you?

00:59:00.492 --> 00:59:08.242
In general, there is one principle you must
apply to all of them.

00:59:08.242 --> 00:59:14.782
On the gross, anybody who is interested in
your money is not your guru; he is a parasite,

00:59:14.782 --> 00:59:15.921
on the gross.

00:59:15.921 --> 00:59:25.642
In the subtle, anybody who doesn't manifest
your powers has no powers of his own.

00:59:25.642 --> 00:59:28.481
These two you apply to every guru and don't
ask Me individual question.

00:59:28.481 --> 00:59:46.332
The one who is interested in Rolls Royce,
I mean if you think him to be a guru, I must

00:59:46.332 --> 00:59:49.543
say this is something surprising.

00:59:49.543 --> 00:59:50.543
Very surprising.

01:00:42.312 --> 01:00:43.312
It's again confused, my child, but doesn't
matter.

01:00:43.312 --> 01:00:45.052
Let's see now...they had a hot air on their
head.

01:00:45.052 --> 01:00:46.382
Did you say so?

01:00:46.382 --> 01:00:47.542
When was it?

01:00:47.542 --> 01:00:49.142
Where was it written?

01:00:49.142 --> 01:00:52.721
You saw it in pictures?

01:00:52.721 --> 01:00:55.592
Reply : In the scriptures.

01:00:55.592 --> 01:00:59.171
[unclear: Pentecost Side B 27:53].

01:00:59.171 --> 01:01:03.211
He sent out twelve men to do his work.

01:01:03.211 --> 01:01:04.211
Shri Mataji: Yes, it's all right.

01:01:04.211 --> 01:01:05.211
Now, I'll tell you what.

01:01:05.211 --> 01:01:06.211
You see, hot air will come out of everybody's
head now.

01:01:06.211 --> 01:01:07.211
Even you are sitting here.

01:01:07.211 --> 01:01:08.252
Because there is heat within you.

01:01:08.252 --> 01:01:11.352
First the hot air will come out.

01:01:11.352 --> 01:01:15.941
You see, Christ tried to give them realization
but they didn't believe Him.

01:01:15.941 --> 01:01:19.192
Believe me that they never believed Him till
he got His resurrection.

01:01:19.192 --> 01:01:21.451
No, till they got His resurrection you see.

01:01:21.451 --> 01:01:28.142
Till He got his resurrection, they were still
like this you see, little half baked, not

01:01:28.142 --> 01:01:29.142
fully there.

01:01:29.142 --> 01:01:31.062
And that's why the hot air came out .

01:01:31.062 --> 01:01:36.242
You will see now, gradually as you'll settle
down in Sahaja Yoga, when you will be fully

01:01:36.242 --> 01:01:39.322
equipped, when your vibrations will flow well,
it will be cool breeze.

01:01:39.322 --> 01:01:41.182
Otherwise, hot air comes out.

01:01:41.182 --> 01:01:43.372
You see, with people who have...

01:01:43.372 --> 01:01:46.481
most of you will first have hot air, no doubt
about it because there is heat within you.

01:01:46.481 --> 01:01:53.171
Now, I will tell you people very frankly about
it that when it is hot, say for example take

01:01:53.171 --> 01:01:56.382
Helium, Helium is a gas - you know that.

01:01:56.382 --> 01:02:02.432
When it is hot, all the molecules in it fight
within, revolt against each other.

01:02:02.432 --> 01:02:03.732
They are absolutely volatile.

01:02:03.732 --> 01:02:08.621
But when it cools down, they become collective
and they move in a collective way.

01:02:08.621 --> 01:02:11.971
Even in science it has been shown and it is
the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost which has

01:02:11.971 --> 01:02:13.512
been described in the Bible also.

01:02:13.512 --> 01:02:19.862
So it should be a cool breeze because even
the Apostles that Christ had, they did not

01:02:19.862 --> 01:02:21.742
get their realization fully because they were
doubting Him.

01:02:21.742 --> 01:02:26.802
Not doubting, I would say they did not have
that faith till they saw He was resurrected.

01:02:26.802 --> 01:02:31.562
And after resurrection to have faith was rather
wrong, isn't it?

01:02:31.562 --> 01:02:34.592
Untimely, I should say.

01:02:34.592 --> 01:02:37.622
I can understand that.

01:02:37.622 --> 01:02:39.981
That time, you see, this was not there.

01:02:39.981 --> 01:02:44.671
I mean, to talk of realization itself in that
country was something so out of the blue.

01:02:44.671 --> 01:02:49.882
They were fishermen, not Cambridge students,
and you could not explain to them.

01:02:49.882 --> 01:02:54.062
But still they were simple people and they
were honest, no doubt about it.

01:02:54.062 --> 01:02:59.112
But to their honesty, they could not understand
how... what this man is saying about self-realization

01:02:59.112 --> 01:03:00.492
or of second birth, you see.

01:03:00.492 --> 01:03:02.492
And so they doubted - was all right at that
time.

01:03:02.492 --> 01:03:08.921
But today it is not all right because once
you get realization, you see for yourself.

01:03:08.921 --> 01:03:09.921
All right?

01:03:09.921 --> 01:03:17.142
Q: [Unclear: also had this experience after
the resurrection Side B 30:10]

01:03:17.142 --> 01:03:20.772
Shri Mataji: You see, they had faith with
Him.

01:03:20.772 --> 01:03:25.942
But I wouldn't say they got realization, except
for John, I would say; but others, I am not

01:03:25.942 --> 01:03:26.942
very sure.

01:03:26.942 --> 01:03:31.981
Because the way they write about His works,
it's something an outsider writes, you see.

01:03:31.981 --> 01:03:34.962
It's just a ... not a person who is innate.

01:03:34.962 --> 01:03:37.072
You see, when they write, that's not there,
I find.

01:03:37.072 --> 01:03:40.192
But the worst of all I feel is about St. Paul
who should not be there at all.

01:03:40.192 --> 01:03:41.902
He had nothing to do with Christ.

01:03:41.902 --> 01:03:45.622
I can't understand why he is there because
according to Sahaja Yoga standard, he was

01:03:45.622 --> 01:03:47.332
a supra-conscious personality.

01:03:47.332 --> 01:03:50.431
I don't know why he put them there because
he saw a cross or he did all this.

01:03:50.431 --> 01:03:54.582
He was the one who was killing all the Christians
to begin with and then suddenly, I don't know

01:03:54.582 --> 01:03:58.872
how - it was a Roman trick perhaps to put
him there - I don't know why but somehow I

01:03:58.872 --> 01:04:00.362
cannot explain it.

[Interruption by an audience - UNCLEAR Side

right?

01:04:30.312 --> 01:04:33.242

have you got?

Why discuss all these things?

01:05:07.702 --> 01:05:10.852
We have so many clergies here who have been
studying Bible and all that and they are now

01:05:10.852 --> 01:05:11.852
fed up.

01:05:11.852 --> 01:05:12.852

Shri Mataji: Of course, that you will be in

01:05:28.431 --> 01:05:29.431
meditation.

01:05:29.431 --> 01:05:31.892
You cannot meditate; you get into meditation.

01:05:31.892 --> 01:05:33.602
That is the most meditative state.

01:05:33.602 --> 01:05:35.382
Now, so I will tell you what happens to you,
all right?

01:05:35.382 --> 01:05:36.382
Let me talk on that.

01:05:36.382 --> 01:05:40.762
That's a better question, a very good question.

01:05:40.762 --> 01:05:48.122
First when the Kundalini rises - all right?
- you won't feel anything, most of you won't

01:05:48.122 --> 01:05:50.352
feel anything, but some of you may feel.

01:05:50.352 --> 01:05:53.492
You may feel heat in the body.

01:05:53.492 --> 01:05:59.622
You may feel kind of a, some people might
feel the throbbing in the back in the spinal

01:05:59.622 --> 01:06:02.411
cord, might feel, little, not much.

01:06:02.411 --> 01:06:04.782
It's not very painful or anything.

01:06:04.782 --> 01:06:05.892
Don't be frightened of anything.

01:06:05.892 --> 01:06:08.092
Then it will rise.

01:06:08.092 --> 01:06:12.221
Some of you might feel the rising, because
if there are obstructions you can feel the

01:06:12.221 --> 01:06:13.221
rising.

01:06:13.221 --> 01:06:16.951
If there isn't any obstruction, if you are
not misidentified, if you are not extremist,

01:06:16.951 --> 01:06:21.822
if you are in the center, normally it shoots
off in the split of a second.

01:06:21.822 --> 01:06:27.532
When it shoots off, what do you feel is, you
feel a cool breeze coming out of your head.

01:06:27.532 --> 01:06:31.921
But normally, as I have seen, people are complicated.

01:06:31.921 --> 01:06:34.882
There are complications in the physical, mental
or emotional being.

01:06:34.882 --> 01:06:36.442
People are not so balanced.

01:06:36.442 --> 01:06:39.602
Mostly they have liver problems or such things
like that.

01:06:39.602 --> 01:06:42.082
You might get heat coming out.

01:06:42.082 --> 01:06:45.072
First the heat comes; quite a lot of heat
might come.

01:06:45.072 --> 01:06:49.922
When the heat disappears, then you start feeling
the cool coming and you feel very nice inside.

01:06:49.922 --> 01:06:52.042
Then the bliss starts coming.

01:06:52.042 --> 01:06:57.522
You start feeling absolutely relaxed and you
feel in your hands the cool breeze is coming.

01:06:57.522 --> 01:06:59.582
But first of all you feel on the head.

01:06:59.582 --> 01:07:01.461
You should feel yourself.

01:07:01.461 --> 01:07:02.981
Nobody is going to certify it for you.

01:07:02.981 --> 01:07:04.392
There is no falsehood about it.

01:07:04.392 --> 01:07:07.422
It's a thing that you have to feel it.

01:07:07.422 --> 01:07:13.032
And once it happens to you then you can develop
it.

01:07:13.032 --> 01:07:18.911
Because though the Kundalini at the first
shot comes out but then She tries to look

01:07:18.911 --> 01:07:25.431
after your different organs if they are sick,
your mind if it is overloaded, or anything

01:07:25.431 --> 01:07:29.681
that is wrong it creates a balance [unclear
Side B 34:42]...

01:07:29.681 --> 01:07:33.872
So you have to just know how to reestablish
it yourself because it is your own.

01:07:33.872 --> 01:07:35.002
Everything is your own.

01:07:35.002 --> 01:07:38.572
It's - you can think like this that this light
is your own.

01:07:38.572 --> 01:07:40.772
It is your own lamp.

01:07:40.772 --> 01:07:44.792
I just have come because I have got the flame
in Me, perhaps.

01:07:44.792 --> 01:07:46.302
Then I put the lamp.

01:07:46.302 --> 01:07:47.902
Your light is enlightened.

01:07:47.902 --> 01:07:49.762
Now you look after your light.

01:07:49.762 --> 01:07:51.772
It's your light, it's everything yours.

01:07:51.772 --> 01:07:52.972
The power is yours.

01:07:52.972 --> 01:07:54.012
It's your mother.

01:07:54.012 --> 01:07:57.231
It's your own spirit.

01:07:57.231 --> 01:07:59.262
And then you work it out.

01:07:59.262 --> 01:08:07.622
Unless and until you work it out, you will
not know whether it is true or not.

01:08:07.622 --> 01:08:08.921
You have to work it out.

01:08:08.921 --> 01:08:13.362
Now you should not be identified with anything,
that's one thing is true; because you have

01:08:13.362 --> 01:08:14.981
not seen the reality so far.

01:08:14.981 --> 01:08:17.942
Say, for example, Mr X says, "This one says
so."

01:08:17.942 --> 01:08:21.202
All right, must have said it but he is not
here.

01:08:21.202 --> 01:08:24.442
Today he is not here; it is I who am sitting
here.

01:08:24.442 --> 01:08:25.442
All right?

01:08:25.442 --> 01:08:29.671
So it is better that what I am saying you
better receive it because it's nice to live

01:08:29.671 --> 01:08:30.671
with the past.

01:08:30.671 --> 01:08:36.022
Like, people want to believe in the past because
it is easy to handle the past, or live with

01:08:36.022 --> 01:08:39.432
the future because it is easy, or live with
somebody who has written a book or something

01:08:39.432 --> 01:08:40.782
he had done to us.

01:08:40.782 --> 01:08:46.183
But why not believe in yourself that so far
you have not got anything of your own and

01:08:46.183 --> 01:08:50.181
I am saying that you have to get it of your
own.

01:08:50.181 --> 01:08:54.971
That's the main point I am trying to say,
that you must not believe into anything till

01:08:54.971 --> 01:08:57.242
you have found it yourself within your self.

01:08:57.242 --> 01:08:58.492
That's what it is.

01:08:58.492 --> 01:09:03.102
And if you are identified with other things
which you have been doing - most of the people

01:09:03.102 --> 01:09:06.922
who have paid to some Guru or some thing,
get very much identified with them.

01:09:06.922 --> 01:09:08.352
But what have they given you?

01:09:08.352 --> 01:09:09.731
Have they given you any powers?

01:09:09.731 --> 01:09:10.731
Nothing.

01:09:10.731 --> 01:09:11.731
Can you feel another person?

01:09:11.731 --> 01:09:15.941
In collective consciousness, you should be
able to feel another person.

01:09:15.941 --> 01:09:20.602
After realization, immediately you can start
feeling another person and yourself.

01:09:20.602 --> 01:09:26.691
Immediately you can feel, but you need sensitivity
which we lack quite a lot in the Western world

01:09:26.691 --> 01:09:28.492
because the [unclear sounds like 'light is
very small' Side B 36:36].

01:09:28.492 --> 01:09:32.552
But in India I have seen people get realization
(and) immediately they start feeling it like

01:09:32.552 --> 01:09:33.552
that.

01:09:33.552 --> 01:09:38.582
It's very easy to cure Indians, I must say,
but difficult to cure Western people.

01:09:38.582 --> 01:09:42.512
They are very complicated, ego-oriented, over-read,
all that is there.

01:09:42.512 --> 01:09:47.442
But once the Western get it, they settle down
much faster, much better, much deeply than

01:09:47.442 --> 01:09:48.451
Indians do.

01:09:48.451 --> 01:09:54.262
It's like if you have the teeth, you don't
have the food; and if you have the food, you

01:09:54.262 --> 01:09:55.492
don't have the teeth.

01:09:55.492 --> 01:09:58.961
It's a funny combination, this world is.

01:09:58.961 --> 01:10:01.402
Q: [unclear Side B 37:04]

01:10:01.402 --> 01:10:03.331
All right, let's have it.

01:10:03.331 --> 01:10:08.501
Now see what sort of thing you work out in
Cambridge.

01:10:08.501 --> 01:10:09.501
All right?

01:10:09.501 --> 01:10:11.701
So all of us should forget all about these
things.

01:10:11.701 --> 01:10:14.092
Be honest to yourself and fair to yourself.

01:10:14.092 --> 01:10:17.052
So far, by doing all these things you haven't
found yourself.

01:10:17.052 --> 01:10:18.671
Accept this fact.

01:10:18.671 --> 01:10:22.801
I have nothing to gain out of you.

01:10:22.801 --> 01:10:28.971
I haven't even written a single line, a book,
nothing.

01:10:28.971 --> 01:10:33.221
So you must know that it is your own.

01:10:33.221 --> 01:10:38.161
I am just like a banker who is cashing your
checks.

01:10:38.161 --> 01:10:44.051
Better have them cashed, for which you don't
have to pay anything.

01:10:44.051 --> 01:10:46.321
You don't have to put in any effort, nothing.

01:10:46.321 --> 01:10:49.891
But once you are realized then you will know
what is to be done.

01:10:49.891 --> 01:10:51.611
But first get your lights on.

01:10:51.611 --> 01:10:57.742
All right, now just co-operate with me as
I tell you, without much questioning.

01:10:57.742 --> 01:11:05.592
I am not going to tell you anything horrid
nor am I going to trouble you by anything.

01:11:05.592 --> 01:11:07.316
It is your own blessing just waiting at your
door step.

01:11:07.316 --> 01:11:08.316
Can you believe Me now?

01:11:08.316 --> 01:11:09.316
If you can believe only this much that I am
genuine, it will work out.

01:11:09.316 --> 01:11:10.316
May God bless you.

01:11:10.316 --> 01:11:11.316
All right, now put your hands towards Me and
if it is not very inconvenient, please take

01:11:11.316 --> 01:11:12.316
out your shoes because this Mother Earth also
helps us.

01:11:12.316 --> 01:11:13.316
It's better to take out your shoes; it helps.

01:11:13.316 --> 01:11:14.316
If you are sitting on the ground, it's all
right.

01:11:14.316 --> 01:11:15.316
You have to touch your Mother Earth with your
feet so if you can take out your shoes easily,

01:11:15.316 --> 01:11:16.316
it will work out faster.

01:11:16.316 --> 01:11:17.316
Moreover, it is a very tight thing on the
feet.

01:11:17.316 --> 01:11:18.316
Now this is the question of language of hands
which is an international language always,

01:11:18.316 --> 01:11:19.316
but this is the language where the hands get
enlightened and the hands have to speak.

01:11:19.316 --> 01:11:20.316
As Mohammad Sahib has said it clearly, "At
the time of resurrection, your hands will

01:11:20.316 --> 01:11:21.316
speak".

01:11:21.316 --> 01:11:22.316
So, your hands have to speak and that's how
we have to see how our hands will be speaking.

01:11:22.316 --> 01:11:23.316
So these centers which are shown here are
represented in your fingers.

01:11:23.316 --> 01:11:24.316
So, these are five, six and seven, this side
left and right.

01:11:24.316 --> 01:11:25.316
Once these centers are enlightened, then you
can feel yourself and feel others.

01:11:25.316 --> 01:11:26.316
To begin with, we do not understand what it
is because it is too great a thing.

01:11:26.316 --> 01:11:27.316
But once we start using it, we are amazed
how we start transforming, how things start

01:11:27.316 --> 01:11:28.316
happening to us.

01:11:28.316 --> 01:11:29.316
All right, now just put your hands straight
like this.

01:11:29.316 --> 01:11:30.316
Sit comfortably.

01:11:30.316 --> 01:11:31.316
Be comfortable.

01:11:31.316 --> 01:11:32.316
If you have anything tight, please make it
a little loose.

01:11:32.316 --> 01:11:33.316
It's better.

01:11:33.316 --> 01:11:34.316
Not that it makes any difference; it's very
subtle.

01:11:34.316 --> 01:11:35.316
But why I am asking you because attention
goes there if it is something tight.

01:11:35.316 --> 01:11:36.316
On the waist also if there is something tight
you see the attention is gone.

01:11:36.316 --> 01:11:37.316
Make yourself comfortable.

01:11:37.316 --> 01:11:38.316
That's the main point, be comfortable so that
for a while you could be with yourself comfortably.

01:11:38.316 --> 01:11:39.316
If you are wearing any big malas and all that,
please take it out.

01:11:39.316 --> 01:11:40.316
It's better.

01:11:40.316 --> 01:11:41.316
It's heavy.

01:11:41.316 --> 01:11:42.316
Anything like that, please take it out.

01:11:42.316 --> 01:11:43.316
It will help us.

01:11:43.316 --> 01:11:44.316
Just first get yourself realized and then
you start understanding.

01:11:44.316 --> 01:11:45.316
Now, after this I have to tell you one more
thing that you have to keep your eyes shut.

01:11:45.316 --> 01:11:46.316
The reason is that when the Kundalini rises
above this which it wants to pierce through,

01:11:46.316 --> 01:11:47.316
at that time it presses this point and the
pupils go into dilatation first before it

01:11:47.316 --> 01:11:48.316
is piercing it and that's why, if the eyes
are open and the Kundalini is passing through,

01:11:48.316 --> 01:11:49.316
She may stop.

01:11:49.316 --> 01:11:50.316
So please keep your eyes shut, that's all.

01:11:50.316 --> 01:11:51.316
Just keep your eyes shut till I tell you to
open them.

01:11:51.316 --> 01:11:52.316
And if you have spectacles and all that, you
can also keep them safe because you don't

01:11:52.316 --> 01:11:53.316
have to see Me anymore till I ask you to open
your eyes.

01:11:53.316 --> 01:11:54.316
So it's better to keep so that you don't have
problems of your spectacles.

01:11:54.316 --> 01:11:55.316
Now close your eyes.

01:11:55.316 --> 01:11:56.316
Now don't open your eyes as I requested you.

01:11:56.316 --> 01:11:57.316
Please don't open your eyes, that's all.

01:11:57.316 --> 01:11:58.316
Because this is just the opposite of hypnosis.

01:11:58.316 --> 01:11:59.316
In hypnosis, they make you open your eyes
and put their eyes into your eyes and do all

01:11:59.316 --> 01:12:00.316
these things.

01:12:00.316 --> 01:12:01.316
What's happening?

01:12:01.316 --> 01:12:02.316
Now, no gesticulations, nothing abnormal has
to be done.

01:12:02.316 --> 01:12:03.316
Whatever has to happen will happen within.

01:12:03.316 --> 01:12:04.316
Nothing abnormal thing has to be done.

01:12:04.316 --> 01:12:05.316
Nobody has to jump, shout or scream - that's
all nonsense.

01:12:05.316 --> 01:12:06.316
You are not to do anything like that, not
to turn your necks or anything.

01:12:06.316 --> 01:12:07.316
Just keep quiet.

01:12:07.316 --> 01:12:08.316
If you cannot keep quiet, it's better that
you go out for the time being.

01:12:08.316 --> 01:12:09.316
But just keep quiet.

01:12:09.316 --> 01:12:09.323
That's very important not to disturb others.
