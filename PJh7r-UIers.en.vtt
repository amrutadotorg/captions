WEBVTT

03:26.122 --> 03:33.813
Yesterday’s experience was that
the whole day I had to spend it

03:33.838 --> 03:39.258
with police people explaining to them.

03:39.283 --> 03:46.857
And now I feel that in Maharashtra,
there is a rule of Mafia.

03:46.882 --> 03:55.004
And that it is for us to face it
and we have to prove it.

03:55.029 --> 03:58.322
I am sorry some people were hurt
so badly

03:58.347 --> 04:01.212
and I'll think after Puja they’ll take
you to the hospital.

04:01.237 --> 04:06.883
Here there is a very nice hospital where
we have very good doctors.

04:06.908 --> 04:21.002
And then I would request you
to know that,

04:21.857 --> 04:30.920
the evil and the good, always has
to struggle and fight.

04:30.945 --> 04:40.278
Formerly in this great country of
Maharashtra all the saints were tortured,

04:40.303 --> 04:47.583
to such an extent that it is amazing
how despite all that

04:47.607 --> 04:54.825
they kept the banner of spirituality
so high.

04:54.850 --> 05:04.997
They are still existing, the same people,

05:05.022 --> 05:09.480
who have tortured the saints and I think
they are the same people

05:09.505 --> 05:16.705
who have behaved in such a bad manner
towards you all.

05:18.000 --> 05:26.271
This kind of ego-trip builds up
in everyone

05:26.296 --> 05:30.317
– even in among sahaja yogis, it does
build up.

05:30.342 --> 05:36.829
And they are all the time
on a different scene.

05:36.854 --> 05:46.124
This is like Hitler's style of behavior
that you pick up some sort of an issue.

05:46.149 --> 05:49.440
An issue could be anything, like they
are saying that

05:49.465 --> 05:52.462
“we are trying to remove all the blind
faiths”. I mean,

05:52.487 --> 05:57.847
I've done this for eighteen years,
what can they do more than that?

05:57.872 --> 06:01.279
And I have removed all your blind faiths
in all kinds of stupid things

06:01.304 --> 06:04.851
that the religion, so-called, was teaching
you.

06:04.876 --> 06:09.134
In every religion, there is no question
of only Hindu religion.

06:09.159 --> 06:11.760
But here they dare not say anything
about the Muslims

06:11.785 --> 06:14.592
because the Hindus are very mild people.

06:14.617 --> 06:18.438
They (the muslims) want that
all the temples must be removed,

06:18.463 --> 06:22.295
all the deities must be thrown away.

06:22.320 --> 06:28.542
This is all I think Rajneesh is their guru
because he made a...

06:29.929 --> 06:39.882
he made an exhibition where he tried
to show

06:39.907 --> 06:44.054
that Ganapati was something very funny
and all that.

06:44.079 --> 06:46.784
Now medically you know in Sahaja Yoga,

06:46.784 --> 06:52.027
that without Ganesha we cannot cure
many diseases. Is a fact.

06:52.052 --> 06:56.210
So a stupid fellow talking like that,
has become now the guru of these people

06:56.235 --> 06:59.783
who are discarded all over the world
and who have been insulted.

06:59.808 --> 07:04.988
So these few newspapers have made
him as a guru, perhaps that

07:05.013 --> 07:09.342
they are following his methods of saying
that we should be,

07:09.367 --> 07:12.845
we should be rid of all these ideas
and this and that.

07:12.870 --> 07:20.262
But they have gone to the extent that
all the spirituality is an illusion.

07:21.627 --> 07:25.842
It's such a joke. And that we should
give up

07:25.867 --> 07:32.663
all the, all readings and all understanding
about spirituality.

07:32.663 --> 07:37.225
But they do not know that their heritage
is spirituality.

07:37.250 --> 07:40.688
And the whole world depends on that.

07:40.713 --> 07:45.181
The whole world, because when the people
took to industrial development,

07:45.206 --> 07:48.356
you know how far they have gone
and how much they are lost.

07:48.381 --> 07:52.194
And how far you were in that mess.
And how you came back

07:52.219 --> 07:54.976
because of Sahaja Yoga’s spirituality.

07:55.016 --> 08:02.784
Now if this nourishment from the roots
of spirituality

08:02.809 --> 08:07.643
does not reach the West, the real
knowledge, as it is in Sahaja Yoga,

08:07.668 --> 08:12.457
the West will be finished. West will be
finished, you know that very well.

08:12.482 --> 08:16.986
There is no joy, there is no love,
there is no poetry,

08:17.011 --> 08:21.282
there is no music, there is no culture.

08:23.077 --> 08:29.262
But as you have understood that now
these people have now started

08:29.287 --> 08:32.178
talking about “no religion”
“no religion”,

08:32.203 --> 08:35.311
like many of your western countries
have also done,

08:35.336 --> 08:37.814
specially Russia has done that way,

08:37.839 --> 08:40.758
that there is nothing like God,
there is nothing like this and that.

08:40.783 --> 08:44.797
And now after all that now they
are coming to God.

08:44.822 --> 08:48.191
So now we’ll have to go through
another circle.

08:48.216 --> 08:51.786
But they are only hardly twenty people.

08:51.811 --> 08:58.224
So even one fellow who is like Hitler,
can destroy the whole thing.

08:58.249 --> 09:04.598
This is a very important thing - to destroy
something you need only one person.

09:04.623 --> 09:12.866
But to sustain and to construct
you need many people.

09:12.891 --> 09:19.956
To drown a ship, you need only
one hole in it.

09:19.981 --> 09:26.127
But to build the ship, you take months
together.

09:26.152 --> 09:30.309
So the work that is done for these
last eighteen years

09:30.334 --> 09:34.017
of Sahaja Yoga, is really tremendous.

09:34.042 --> 09:37.217
And the truth about it, you know
for definite,

09:37.242 --> 09:42.304
that it has helped so many people. Though
we have been going from ups and downs

09:42.329 --> 09:45.926
and all that, we've been doing wrong
things, no doubt about it,

09:45.951 --> 09:52.405
but still, now we are quite established
and we know what Sahaja Yoga is.

09:52.430 --> 09:59.616
The experience of Sahaja Yoga you all
have had. We have seen so many,

09:59.641 --> 10:03.642
(towards someone…) “What is she doing?
Please be seated”.

10:04.573 --> 10:09.148
Miraculous photographs you have seen,
so many miracles in your life day to day.

10:09.173 --> 10:14.371
Every day there are miracles. Now to say
there is no God

10:14.396 --> 10:18.337
is impossible for you because you have
felt the miracles

10:18.362 --> 10:22.721
of this All-pervading Power,
the Paramchaitanya.

10:22.746 --> 10:26.167
And also all the religions are explained

10:26.192 --> 10:31.702
and the complete integration of them
has been brought in.

10:31.727 --> 10:37.165
But for that we have to know, as I told
you in Brahmapuri,

10:37.190 --> 10:41.638
that the sahaja yogis have to know that
they have to become dynamic.

10:41.663 --> 10:48.750
Whatever energies you have got, whatever
you have achieved within yourselves,

10:48.775 --> 10:53.850
is not sufficient enough. You have
to manifest.

10:53.875 --> 10:58.237
And in that dynamism, I think people
get lost.

10:58.262 --> 11:01.590
I have seen that some leaders become
horrid.

11:01.615 --> 11:06.400
I mean, sometimes their Vishuddhis could
be horrible, then their heart goes out.

11:06.436 --> 11:13.615
So you should not allow anybody (to be)
a leader for more than one month.

11:13.640 --> 11:18.817
It goes off. I have seen it. Because your
balloon has been already bloated

11:18.842 --> 11:24.493
and again it gets re-bloated in no time.
(speaking in Marathi…).

11:27.864 --> 11:34.598
They have religiously kept all the Indians
outside, I think. (speaking in Marathi…).

11:37.379 --> 11:40.529
I mean, he is the organizer here.

11:42.588 --> 11:45.855
(speaking Marathi)

11:48.410 --> 11:53.852
So the heritage of our country is
spirituality.

11:56.231 --> 12:00.392
And this is the nourishment.

12:00.417 --> 12:09.671
Only the one-sided growth in the West, due
to machinery or whatever you may call it,

12:10.539 --> 12:14.465
has ruined it completely.

12:14.490 --> 12:17.757
And one-sided growth in this country,
and all such countries,

12:17.782 --> 12:24.990
where religion has become a blind faith,
has also ruined it.

12:25.015 --> 12:29.778
But in the center lies Sahaja Yoga.

12:29.803 --> 12:36.873
Now your wisdom, your sense,
is so apparent.

12:36.898 --> 12:42.649
I mean, people have been to all kinds
of gurus here and have been to everyone,

12:42.674 --> 12:47.120
but they don’t know anything about
anything. Except for remembering by heart

12:47.145 --> 12:51.516
- some these Hare Ramas, talk about,
“Rama” “Rama” – like that.

12:51.541 --> 12:54.471
While you know everything about Kundalini.
You know how to raise it.

12:54.496 --> 12:57.851
You know how to give Realization. You know
what are the diseases are caused,

12:57.876 --> 13:01.968
how to cure it and everything and
everything and everything.

13:01.993 --> 13:08.055
I mean, it has come to such a stage
that nobody asks Me any questions.

13:10.433 --> 13:14.146
Otherwise, in the beginning in London,
My lecture was for five minutes

13:14.171 --> 13:19.703
and the questions were for the rest
of the time.

13:19.728 --> 13:24.334
So now you know so much.

13:26.783 --> 13:33.138
And you accept which cannot be explained
also, because you know that.

13:33.163 --> 13:38.216
For example, somebody will ask Me,
“Mother, how do you get these photographs?”

13:38.241 --> 13:41.815
Why are we talking about it?

13:41.840 --> 13:48.462
I know how it happens, who is doing
this trick. But I don’t want to tell you.

13:51.658 --> 13:53.812
Moreover, if you demand something,
I’ll never tell you.

13:53.837 --> 13:56.049
That’s one of the characters I have.

13:56.074 --> 14:01.097
Ah, if you come with humble thing
and honest desire to know,

14:01.122 --> 14:04.026
then I can tell you about everything,
that you want to know.

14:04.051 --> 14:07.043
But if you just want to force Me and say
that, “I challenge you”,

14:07.068 --> 14:09.961
I said, “I also challenge you.
Get out of here”.

14:09.986 --> 14:13.127
Like that. You see, it doesn’t react,
that way.

14:13.152 --> 14:19.380
So it is just the temperament
of the Divine

14:19.420 --> 14:26.344
that if you are convex, the Divine
becomes convex also,

14:26.369 --> 14:31.686
and fights and says, “No, get out”.
If you become concave,

14:31.711 --> 14:40.246
then it emits and gives knowledge,
or receives knowledge.

14:40.271 --> 14:46.237
So one has to be humble. That’s very
important part of it. One has to be humble.

14:46.262 --> 14:54.517
So the awareness, again I talk about
awareness,

14:54.542 --> 14:59.589
within you should be that, how much
we have come to know about ourselves.

14:59.614 --> 15:03.068
How much we have to come to know
about others?

15:03.093 --> 15:10.687
How much we know about our own being?
How much we know about chakras?

15:10.712 --> 15:14.553
In such a short time, how did we come
to know about it?

15:14.578 --> 15:18.602
Like we should know, if you are dealing
with a computer,

15:18.627 --> 15:25.861
and you know how computer works, how
it acts, how it is programmed, everything

15:25.886 --> 15:31.801
without programming it, without working
it out, without building it up.

15:31.826 --> 15:35.078
I mean, if you build it up, you know
how it works. But without doing that

15:35.103 --> 15:39.150
just to know a computer how it works,
and all the machinery about it,

15:39.175 --> 15:42.774
is a tremendous knowledge.

15:42.799 --> 15:46.451
And this is what has to be there
for all of us

15:46.476 --> 15:50.647
to know what we are there as human beings,
and what we have to do

15:50.774 --> 15:55.737
to emancipate the other human beings.

15:56.327 --> 16:00.752
Of course, I shouldn’t say that every
sahaja yogi is of that level, no.

16:00.777 --> 16:06.089
Or comes up, but everybody is trying.
Nobody has denied Sahaja Yoga.

16:06.114 --> 16:10.475
Nobody has said it’s not true. Everybody
is trying to get

16:10.500 --> 16:16.876
higher and higher in his state
of spirituality which doesn’t speak.

16:16.901 --> 16:23.499
It acts. It doesn’t manipulate. It acts.

16:23.524 --> 16:27.948
And we've seen it acts in so many
miraculous ways.

16:27.973 --> 16:33.566
So first to know about all these things,
after feeling that Paramchaitanya,

16:33.591 --> 16:37.843
is different from just to talk about it.

16:37.868 --> 16:41.949
Many have talked about it, but you have
never felt it.

16:41.974 --> 16:46.878
Now you have felt it, you have verified it,
you have experimented it.

16:46.903 --> 16:52.329
And you have found it that, this is
something absolutely real.

16:52.354 --> 17:00.793
In science, as Dr. Khan was telling Me,
that in science,

17:00.818 --> 17:07.467
the one theory which is established today
might be refuted tomorrow.

17:07.492 --> 17:12.005
Another theory that is established,
may be refuted.

17:12.030 --> 17:16.233
It goes on. So that no theory is
an absolute theory.

17:16.258 --> 17:21.031
But in Sahaja Yoga for the last eighteen
years, whatever I have been saying

17:21.056 --> 17:27.292
is the truth. And is absolute. It cannot
be challenged again.

17:27.317 --> 17:30.671
Nobody can say, “No, Mother,
it is not so”.

17:30.696 --> 17:36.125
A simple thing is, somebody comes to you
and you say, the other day it happened,

17:36.150 --> 17:42.613
one doctor was there in Aurangabad,
and he said that,

17:45.928 --> 17:51.155
“I have never had any guru”. But his left
Swadhistana…

17:51.180 --> 17:54.704
and he was looking very disturbed. He was
a sahaja yogi in a way,

17:54.729 --> 17:59.437
not looking normal. “I have pain
in the stomach,” and this and that.

17:59.462 --> 18:04.910
I asked him, “You had no guru?”,
he said, “No”. (speaking Marathi).

19:18.916 --> 19:24.036
So now as science has progressed
we can see clearly

19:24.061 --> 19:29.128
that it has not got the theory
which is absolute.

19:29.153 --> 19:35.005
But in Sahaja Yoga, as I told you,
there was a gentleman, a doctor,

19:35.030 --> 19:38.455
who was denying, he said, “I had no guru”.
I asked him, “Do you read books?”,

19:38.480 --> 19:44.745
“Yes – he said - I read Vivekananda”.
I said, “That’s it”.

19:44.770 --> 19:48.477
He said he was reading the book
of a particular guru.

19:48.502 --> 19:53.987
We gave a bandhan to that guru
and this fellow felt alright.

19:56.762 --> 20:00.701
There are so many things one has to know
about.

20:00.726 --> 20:08.411
Little, little things are there, which must
be understood in Sahaja Yoga.

20:08.436 --> 20:15.091
And one should do it according to them,
because it is for your benevolence.

20:15.116 --> 20:22.884
Now supposing I say, “Just do these
things”. If you don’t accept Me,

20:22.909 --> 20:26.561
why am I telling you? I am not telling you
because I have to gain anything.

20:26.586 --> 20:31.909
But is for your good. Now if you don’t
want to accept me or if you react,

20:31.934 --> 20:35.917
is not going to help you. Sahaja Yoga
is not for Me, is for you.

20:35.942 --> 20:40.146
Now if you are, truthfully, honestly,
if you are seekers,

20:40.171 --> 20:45.386
then you must know that "My aim
is to rise spiritually".

20:45.411 --> 20:48.087
Now in science you have risen quite a lot,
you are fed up with it.

20:48.112 --> 20:51.106
Now you’re back into spirituality

20:51.131 --> 20:54.879
and for spirituality you have to be
a subtler person.

20:54.905 --> 20:59.251
And for these subtleties you have
to give up all your conditionings.

20:59.276 --> 21:03.209
All funny conditionings are to be given
and the worst that you have,

21:03.234 --> 21:09.264
is the ego part. It just jumps up. I have
seen that appointing people leaders

21:09.297 --> 21:14.262
has been the greatest harmful thing
I have done to them.

21:14.287 --> 21:18.511
So many of them just got lost, because
they became leaders.

21:18.536 --> 21:23.480
I mean, a kind of a Hitler, enters
into them.

21:23.505 --> 21:26.729
So this is one of the worst conditionings
we have.

21:26.754 --> 21:33.421
We have to be very careful that we don’t
try to assert our ego on others.

21:33.446 --> 21:36.915
When we become leaders or a some position
is given to us,

21:36.940 --> 21:46.022
or ask something is to be achieved
through your authority.

21:46.047 --> 21:48.889
Only we have the authority of God.

21:48.914 --> 21:55.317
Unless and until we become humble
like that, nothing is going to flow.

21:55.342 --> 22:02.245
You can see that, that the sea lies
the lowest in height.

22:02.270 --> 22:06.388
And all the rivers and everything flows
to the sea.

22:06.413 --> 22:10.861
And from the sea only rises the rain.

22:10.886 --> 22:16.425
Supposing sea was somewhere on top
of Himalayas,

22:16.450 --> 22:26.895
we would have been all living
in the Sahara desert.

22:27.701 --> 22:33.577
Is a very simple thing, is to be humble
- that’s first sign - is to be humble,

22:33.602 --> 22:42.544
is to be non-violent, because we depend
on the All-pervading Power.

22:42.569 --> 22:47.550
It is a power which is completely
integrated within us.

22:47.575 --> 22:54.117
Only we are not the ones, we want
to be aware of it.

22:54.797 --> 22:59.560
So this ignorance, this blindness,
if it disappears from us,

22:59.593 --> 23:04.706
that Divine Power will manifest.

23:04.731 --> 23:09.943
But our styles are so complicated.

23:09.968 --> 23:13.697
Sometimes I just don’t understand,

23:14.295 --> 23:19.860
why we have complicated ourselves
so much.

23:19.885 --> 23:26.482
I mean, look at the flowers, look at
the leaves; they are on a tree, supposing.

23:26.507 --> 23:32.761
Automatically they will open out
to the sun. Automatically.

23:32.786 --> 23:36.199
You don’t have to take a leaf towards
the sun, not at all.

23:36.224 --> 23:39.003
Automatically it opens out. You have
seen it every day.

23:39.028 --> 23:42.261
Automatically. Because it requires sun.

23:42.286 --> 23:48.498
Now you want to have spirit in yourself.
You want to get to spirit.

23:48.523 --> 23:53.684
So automatically you should, really
automatically, if that is your desire,

23:53.709 --> 24:01.724
you should, with your own desire only,
should get to the light of the spirit.

24:01.749 --> 24:09.471
And should grow in that spirit to know
that this is what you have to achieve.

24:11.957 --> 24:15.461
But small things disturb you,

24:15.486 --> 24:19.843
like somebody doesn’t get married. Next
day you see the face of that person,

24:19.868 --> 24:24.965
as if somebody has died in the family
he is sitting there.

24:24.993 --> 24:32.008
Really, I have seen it. Immediately I make
out who has not been yet engaged.

24:34.329 --> 24:38.984
Then after marriage I find again
the same sort of nonsense.

24:39.009 --> 24:44.336
Because they are analyzing, “I want
this kind, I want that kind. I want”.

24:44.361 --> 24:49.567
I mean, whatever is available here
is available.

24:53.761 --> 24:59.715
Like on the ship, you don’t have any
problems, because you have no solutions.

24:59.740 --> 25:02.158
If you are moving on a ship and you
just ask for something,

25:02.183 --> 25:06.398
“Oh no, not available here,” finished.

25:10.037 --> 25:14.376
But then you lose all the fun of Sahaja
Yoga for a small little nonsensical thing.

25:14.401 --> 25:20.037
If not this, next year. What is
so important?

25:20.062 --> 25:26.489
I mean, certain there are limitations
of age, height, this, that.

25:26.514 --> 25:31.337
Then even if you arrange their marriages,
is very interesting,

25:31.362 --> 25:34.192
then they come and tell you, “No, no,
I would not like to marry this girl”.

25:34.217 --> 25:37.190
Why? “Because I want such and such”.
All right, then we find.

25:37.215 --> 25:40.127
“No, no, no, she is no good. She has
these things,” so move that.

25:40.152 --> 25:44.715
I mean this is not the way. You are not
here to choose a girl for yourself.

25:44.740 --> 25:48.563
Then there is another one who can say,
“All right, I came down, I saw one girl

25:48.588 --> 25:55.501
and fell in love”. So you fall in love
and get out. This nonsense going on.

25:55.526 --> 26:02.334
See, you must have certain amount
of dignity. You are all sahaja yogis.

26:02.366 --> 26:05.436
And when I see all this kind
of stupid attitude,

26:05.461 --> 26:10.876
I say these people can never gain
in Sahaja Yoga.

26:11.841 --> 26:17.565
In India you will be surprised. I mean,

26:18.303 --> 26:23.085
even I was married to a man who was
from another, another place.

26:23.110 --> 26:27.784
Absolutely different country, different
religion, different everything.

26:27.809 --> 26:29.942
And a different person.

26:29.967 --> 26:34.400
So one can say that it was a very
unconventional marriage, one can say.

26:34.425 --> 26:40.303
But I would never touch this man
or he would never touch me.

26:40.328 --> 26:44.995
And if he would talk to me,
in the presence of others only.

26:46.316 --> 26:51.356
And despite that, our marriage is very
strong and we are very happy couple.

26:51.381 --> 26:54.140
With all these nonsense you go on doing,
bringing it to the level

26:54.165 --> 26:57.885
of physical appearances, physical
understanding, your ego,

26:57.910 --> 27:03.486
“I want this, I want that”, you find that
just after the marriage you get off.

27:03.511 --> 27:06.538
You start analyzing. That’s why
I am telling you today.

27:06.563 --> 27:12.114
I may not able to talk to you about
marriages later on. That be careful.

27:12.139 --> 27:16.372
And that’s how you have brought
problems to Me.

27:17.655 --> 27:21.616
You see, once you accept that in Sahaja
Yoga you are going to marry,

27:21.641 --> 27:25.605
then you must accept that Sahaja Yoga
has its own norms and styles

27:25.630 --> 27:30.579
by which it will marry you and will look
after your marriage and will bless you.

27:30.604 --> 27:35.172
But if you start analyzing
and misbehaving,

27:35.197 --> 27:39.216
it’s not going to work out, and you
will have lots of problems.

27:39.241 --> 27:46.702
Either you believe in the All-pervading
Power and surrender your ego to it,

27:46.727 --> 27:51.213
or else you have your ego.

27:53.808 --> 27:58.481
Sahaja Yoga is decided by Me,
by Paramchaitanya.

27:58.506 --> 28:06.002
Now sometimes in Sahaja Yoga it may
happen that, maybe, it may not work out.

28:06.027 --> 28:14.508
But invariably I have seen, invariably,
is none of My faults. None of My faults.

28:14.533 --> 28:18.057
Mostly the leaders have given wrong
information,

28:18.082 --> 28:23.193
mostly the leaders didn’t talk about
the, about the background.

28:23.218 --> 28:33.510
Or maybe that there has been some sort
of an ego-trip with the people,

28:33.535 --> 28:37.962
and they are the ones who are creating
problems for us.

28:38.742 --> 28:43.930
But things work out. Slowly, gradually
we can improve. We must have patience.

28:43.955 --> 28:48.185
If only on first day you start demanding
something doing that,

28:48.210 --> 28:51.783
it’s not going to work out.

28:53.034 --> 28:58.687
We must learn to give, in marriage
it’s an adjustment of giving.

28:58.712 --> 29:03.031
It is no adjustment of demand.

29:03.664 --> 29:08.127
We have to give. We have to sacrifice.

29:08.152 --> 29:13.092
What is there with you to sacrifice is
all these rubbish things.

29:13.117 --> 29:17.235
Your spirit you cannot sacrifice,
so you keep to your spirit.

29:17.260 --> 29:20.948
And live with it. What is you going
to sacrifice?

29:20.973 --> 29:24.732
I mean, what do you have to give?

29:25.600 --> 29:29.567
And then only you will enjoy.

29:30.615 --> 29:38.548
Then only you will enjoy the spirit.
I am getting cool breeze from you.

29:40.323 --> 29:48.516
So I want you to be very great sahaja
yogis, very great.

29:48.541 --> 29:55.106
And you should really manifest
your powers of wisdom.

29:55.131 --> 29:58.413
Now men have ego part and women
have another side,

29:58.438 --> 30:02.611
is that they are very dull sometimes.
Extremely dull.

30:02.636 --> 30:08.593
They don’t think they have to play a very
dynamic role, while they are the shaktis.

30:08.618 --> 30:13.696
Like they will not even clap hands,
they will not even have their torches

30:13.721 --> 30:20.106
to see what’s happening. Nothing. They just
think they are just a, sort of parasites.

30:20.131 --> 30:25.431
Just coming here as wives or sisters,
or whatever it is, wearing saris.

30:25.456 --> 30:29.744
No, you have to be extremely dynamic.

30:29.769 --> 30:33.603
You must know all about Sahaja Yoga.
You must know all about chakras.

30:33.628 --> 30:38.248
You should know everything. In India,
when in the ancient times,

30:38.273 --> 30:41.869
they used to teach them about God,
religion and all that.

30:41.894 --> 30:46.612
So many great ladies we had, Gargi
and Maitreyi and all those,

30:46.637 --> 30:50.221
who were very learned women.

30:50.246 --> 30:56.056
So in no way you should be just women who
do not know anything of Sahaja Yoga.

30:56.081 --> 30:59.914
Sahaja Yoga is not only meant for men;
it’s meant for you, much more for you.

30:59.939 --> 31:05.244
Because you are shakti and I am your
Mother. So I find the women lack that.

31:05.269 --> 31:09.060
They are more worried about the saris,
the this and that, and I mean,

31:09.085 --> 31:15.312
now from the hair-dressing they have
come to saris. That’s what I feel.

31:16.594 --> 31:19.963
Well, it’s just the same.

31:22.083 --> 31:25.384
Of course sari is a very good dress.
It’s nice to wear.

31:25.409 --> 31:28.994
By that we give lot of encouragement
to our weavers in India.

31:29.019 --> 31:33.024
It’s very artistic, and good that
represents also

31:33.049 --> 31:39.192
a very lady-like feminine thing. But that
doesn’t mean you should become so feminine

31:39.217 --> 31:43.412
that you don’t understand Sahaja Yoga.

31:43.437 --> 31:50.391
I have seen women don’t know where
the centers are of the feet.

31:51.681 --> 31:57.047
Indian women know. Men do know….
Indian women know,

31:57.072 --> 32:01.839
but the Western women don’t know,
so many of them.

32:01.864 --> 32:05.172
They don’t know about chakras. They don’t
know how to raise the Kundalini.

32:05.197 --> 32:07.471
They don’t know what’s the problem is.

32:07.496 --> 32:10.992
So once you have left that life, where
you are wearing a sari,

32:11.017 --> 32:16.022
doesn’t mean now that you have become
a woman in the gosha.

32:16.047 --> 32:20.094
Gosha is the one where they have to wear
chadar; chadar, they call it.

32:20.119 --> 32:25.154
No, sari means you can also be
very dynamic.

32:25.179 --> 32:29.742
The same sari that you are wearing,
even the saris of the nine yards,

32:29.767 --> 32:34.034
we have had queens who fought
the English.

32:34.059 --> 32:38.462
You have must heard about Jhansi Ki Rani.
She was hardly of any age.

32:38.487 --> 32:43.284
She jumped from eighty feet height with
her child behind her. She was a widow.

32:43.309 --> 32:49.064
And she fought the English. Left and right.
And when she was killed,

32:49.089 --> 32:55.283
the person who was here, the Englishman,
he said, the governor,

32:55.308 --> 33:01.928
he said, “We have won the war but
the glory goes to Jhansi ki Rani.”

33:03.109 --> 33:09.370
Then we had another one, Chand-bibi,
another lady, in a ...

33:11.722 --> 33:19.124
Ahmednagar; she fought. We had
so many women like that.

33:19.149 --> 33:23.802
Tremendous type of women we had,
though they lived like women.

33:23.827 --> 33:31.071
We had Padmini, we had Noorjahan,
we had Ahilyabai, so many women.

33:31.096 --> 33:35.757
They were not manly at all.
Very woman-like.

33:35.782 --> 33:40.999
There was the last one was Shivaji’s,
Shivaji’s daughter-in-law.

33:41.024 --> 33:43.839
She was only seventeen years of age,
seventeen years.

33:43.864 --> 33:48.158
And she fought this Aurangzeb and she
is the one who defeated him.

33:48.183 --> 33:52.298
Nobody could manage this Aurangzeb
horrible fellow, she defeated him.

33:52.323 --> 33:57.676
So though, you see, the Indian women look
so docile and simple,

33:57.701 --> 34:06.202
but when it comes to their personality,
they are capable of tremendous things.

34:09.695 --> 34:16.046
So this character when you are wearing
the saris you must also know how to tie up

34:16.071 --> 34:20.329
the backside and to fight.

34:22.386 --> 34:27.950
Otherwise you have not got the Sahaj
culture in you.

34:27.975 --> 34:35.131
Either you are very dominating or you are
so docile like cabbages.

34:35.156 --> 34:42.884
You must understand that we have
to be alert, very alert.

34:42.909 --> 34:46.960
And Mother depends on us. On our own
personalities,

34:46.985 --> 34:51.354
that the way we are going to develop
ourselves, our children, our husbands,

34:51.379 --> 34:55.259
our society of Sahaja Yoga, the whole
of Vishwa Nirmal Dharma.

34:55.284 --> 34:59.876
Is the woman who makes the society.

35:00.493 --> 35:09.787
The whole universe is in the hands
of a woman who creates children.

35:10.749 --> 35:16.522
So the stupid ideas of romanticism
and all this nonsense,

35:16.547 --> 35:19.709
has to be finished. The possession
of husband –

35:19.734 --> 35:23.962
“What time you came,” “When did you go,”
“Where did you go,”

35:23.987 --> 35:27.828
and here the women when Shivaji
started his fight

35:27.853 --> 35:34.765
they used to cut their finger, thumb,
and used to put the tika

35:34.790 --> 35:37.986
on the forehead of the husbands who
were going in the war

35:38.011 --> 35:42.826
and they said, “Don’t come showing
your back”.

35:45.046 --> 35:47.865
Such great women we have had
in this Maharashtra,

35:47.890 --> 35:51.002
where you find them to be so mild.

35:51.027 --> 35:56.015
If it comes to their country, if it comes
to their own personality,

35:56.040 --> 36:02.881
to their own chastity or anything, they are
tremendous. Just like lionesses.

36:02.913 --> 36:06.775
So with this sari lots of things go
hand in hand.

36:06.800 --> 36:10.123
Is not only the sari you are wearing,
but you are representing

36:10.148 --> 36:15.534
something very dynamic within
yourself.

36:17.472 --> 36:22.051
Now when we talk about our further
programs

36:22.076 --> 36:26.522
people are insisting that we should have
a program in any case in Kolhapur.

36:26.547 --> 36:28.985
But I told them I’ll not allow sahaja yogis
to go there

36:29.010 --> 36:33.843
because they were hurt so badly. But some
of you can come, not all of you.

36:33.868 --> 36:37.021
I would be rather worried. I don’t think
anybody will hurt you

36:37.046 --> 36:39.917
and they are saying they will make
arrangements.

36:39.942 --> 36:46.020
So if you want to come, if you are
not afraid...

37:01.166 --> 37:06.589
But on one promise. That nobody is going
to beat anyone.

37:06.614 --> 37:09.931
I am saying, “Don’t beat. Don’t beat”
and somebody heard, “Beat”.

37:09.956 --> 37:14.874
I mean, I mean, I have never heard such
sort of thing, when I am saying

37:14.899 --> 37:18.245
on the thing that, “Don’t beat.
Don’t beat,”

37:18.270 --> 37:22.210
then somebody hears that, “Beat them.
Beat them”.

37:23.024 --> 37:26.638
I just don’t understand how can
(that be).

37:26.663 --> 37:32.614
So you don’t have to, really, you don’t
have to beat anyone.

37:32.639 --> 37:35.929
There is no need. You know that
there is Paramchaitanya working.

37:35.954 --> 37:40.907
All this is also the work
of Paramchaitanya. In the afternoon,

37:40.932 --> 37:45.033
Yogi Mahajan was discussing with Me
very seriously like a lawyer,

37:45.058 --> 37:49.164
saying that, “Mother we cannot form
a criminal case on them,

37:49.189 --> 37:56.878
because there is no evidence”. Afternoon.
And in the evening we have evidence now.

38:06.908 --> 38:11.395
And then they are writing in the other way
round, that they were beaten up

38:11.427 --> 38:16.037
and that you threw stones at them.
And none of them were injured.

38:16.062 --> 38:20.440
They must have been vibrated stones,
I think.

38:23.878 --> 38:29.809
How can you? They had no injuries. They
wrote it down they've no injuries.

38:29.834 --> 38:33.099
So there is no need for you to bother
about it.

38:33.124 --> 38:37.871
With all that there were at least more
than four hundred stones that came

38:37.896 --> 38:43.783
and only eighteen people got hurt. And
really seriously, I think, one or two.

38:43.808 --> 38:49.087
So there is nothing and I can cure
all of you, [you] know that very well.

39:01.320 --> 39:04.706
On the whole, you see this country,
especially Maharashtra,

39:04.731 --> 39:08.672
is so full of devotion to God.

39:08.697 --> 39:12.062
Like these things are not going to work
out. But they are very dangerous people

39:12.087 --> 39:18.223
like Hitler, you see, they start moving
about and giving some ideas and all that.

39:18.248 --> 39:22.384
So it is better to finish them at the time
when they are just prospering,

39:22.409 --> 39:27.150
as they call themselves Nirmulan,
is to remove the roots.

39:27.175 --> 39:32.396
So we have to do the Nirmulan
of Nirmulan.

39:32.421 --> 39:36.766
All right. So now today we'll have
the puja.

39:36.791 --> 39:44.849
Then after that if you want you can go
to Kolhapur for your purchase.

39:44.874 --> 39:48.690
But it starts, the shops starts quite late
and will keep quite late till eight

39:48.715 --> 39:53.760
and tomorrow the whole day is available
for you. So you can take your buses.

39:53.785 --> 39:59.170
You can go down there, and you can have
your purchase and all that,

39:59.195 --> 40:02.696
then come back here. Tomorrow also
you can do the same.

40:02.721 --> 40:08.831
Day after tomorrow, our Mr. Govind has
very kindly invited you all to his place,

40:08.856 --> 40:14.042
as it is he is an extremely generous man.
So,

40:25.147 --> 40:27.567
and when I told him that, “You must
take money from Me”,

40:27.608 --> 40:30.268
he was just fighting with Me, “Mother,
give me this first chance.

40:30.293 --> 40:35.691
This is my great honor that…(speaking
Marathi and Hindi to someone)

40:39.811 --> 40:44.719
So… Let them come, if they want to come.”

40:51.746 --> 40:55.328
So then the program is that day
after tomorrow,

40:55.353 --> 41:00.311
after this thing he says it will be over
by 12:30 or one′o clock.

41:00.336 --> 41:04.713
So you will have tonight and tomorrow
full day for your shopping.

41:04.738 --> 41:08.255
But I think then you should not bother
more about shopping.

41:08.280 --> 41:10.837
Whatever you have to do, better finish
tomorrow.

41:10.862 --> 41:13.795
And then you have to come
to the program also.

41:13.820 --> 41:17.573
Day after if you linger on then it will
be very difficult.

41:17.598 --> 41:23.448
So all of you should go there, have your
food, and then go to Ganapatipule.

41:23.473 --> 41:27.503
This is the program. So you reach
Ganapatipule in the evening.

41:27.528 --> 41:30.044
I hope it’s all clear to you.

41:30.069 --> 41:34.029
And whatever you want to buy, you have
to buy here. But I would say

41:34.054 --> 41:38.495
that some of you are really, really
do not know what is real silk is.

41:38.520 --> 41:41.552
And I've seen some people buying
something horrid.

41:41.577 --> 41:45.469
And very thin silk you should not buy
because it will last only for eight days.

41:45.494 --> 41:48.550
And then it will be finished. So don’t go
for cheap things.

41:48.575 --> 41:53.776
One sari which is good sari, silk sari,
is better than ten bad saris.

41:53.801 --> 41:58.154
Luckily now we have some saris that you
wanted for, the printed saris

41:58.179 --> 42:03.007
which I can give you in Ganapatipule.
Nice printed saris,

42:03.032 --> 42:10.187
of the tassar and also silk. We’ll have
them there. You can all buy, there.

42:11.618 --> 42:14.177
Anything else?

42:14.756 --> 42:20.685
Because I don’t think I’ll meet you any
more perhaps till we go to Ganapatipule.

42:20.710 --> 42:25.937
Now also if you could get those
bhajan things, please buy.

42:25.962 --> 42:29.788
I have given you presents twice. But you
never bring them on your tour

42:29.813 --> 42:35.358
and this time again, I don’t want to get
this kind of a thing. (Hindi).

42:35.383 --> 42:42.392
Just show them. Anything of this kind,
please get it. Is very important.

42:42.417 --> 42:47.818
I have given you twice as presents
but it’s very difficult every time

42:47.843 --> 42:54.019
to go to the shop and get it for you.
If you can get them please buy.

42:54.044 --> 43:00.233
Some of you should at least have them.
(speaking marathi to someone)

43:08.585 --> 43:12.670
He will organize, you better purchase.

43:19.350 --> 43:25.688
Now all the marriages practically have
been decided. One or two are left,

43:25.713 --> 43:30.965
which he has also adjusted. Now those who
were over age or something like that,

43:30.990 --> 43:33.560
we could not arrange their marriages.
Doesn’t matter.

43:33.585 --> 43:36.326
It may work out, it may not work out.
Doesn’t matter.

43:36.351 --> 43:40.702
After all, you are in Sahaja Yoga. I mean,
you are really married to Sahaja Yoga,

43:40.727 --> 43:45.217
that’s all. This is something sideways,
you see.

43:45.242 --> 43:48.530
So don’t make very, your life
miserable,

43:48.555 --> 43:52.052
so all the way you have come, to know
that you are not ...

43:52.077 --> 43:56.271
we have not been able to arrange
your marriage. It’s not proper.

43:56.296 --> 44:00.052
Just enjoy. Don’t miss the point.

44:00.077 --> 44:03.358
May God bless you.
