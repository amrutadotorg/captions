1
00:00:01,819 --> 00:00:07,809
This has been the month of warnings somehow,
because certain things I’ve been seeing

2
00:00:07,809 --> 00:00:24,609
in people how it happens and, how people get
into problems, how our inner being is disturbed,

3
00:00:24,609 --> 00:00:36,739
and why sometimes Sahaja Yoga fails within
you. One must understand the dangers we face

4
00:00:36,739 --> 00:00:42,370
as human beings.
No doubt you are the highest of this creation,

5
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:51,020
no doubt. For you this Universe was created,
for you this Earth was created, no doubt.

6
00:00:51,020 --> 00:01:02,940
And today you are at a situation where you
have to get out of this illusion. The time

7
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:12,770
has come, everything is right. But on a tree
if you notice the most delicate stage is that

8
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:22,110
of a flower. Flower is the most delicate thing.
The roots are tough, extremely tough: they

9
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:30,090
penetrate through the land, hardest possible
land; they go through different rocks and

10
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:36,060
find their ways. But when it comes to the
flower stage, it’s a very, very, delicate

11
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:46,899
stage: though the whole creation just waits
for that time. The whole tree works it out,

12
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:54,329
and the tree creates that beautiful flower.
It’s waiting for that time, that blossom

13
00:01:54,329 --> 00:02:00,520
time, when the flowers have to become the
fruit. Now that is the time, that precarious

14
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:11,970
time, that beautiful time, that fantastic,
dynamic time is. But we do not know how delicate

15
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:22,260
it is, and that’s how, we really play too
much with ourselves.

16
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:32,800
Before realisation, you have seen people who
have come to Me who had terrible mental problems;

17
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:41,190
who were mentally deranged people absolutely,
epileptic and of serious type. They got cured,

18
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:50,110
they got their realisation, they settled back.
You have seen people with cancer, with blood

19
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:55,510
cancer, all kinds of physical troubles: they
got their blessings, they got their realisation,

20
00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:02,780
they have settled back. You have seen people
from very false gurus who have damaged their

21
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:07,820
being completely, who have been mesmerised,
who have been absolutely misled and lynched

22
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:15,950
and have been made into you can say just cabbages.
Such people also came to Sahaja Yoga and tried

23
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:20,420
and prospered.
But again it’s the flower stage one must

24
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:31,540
not forget, and that is the time one has to
be very careful. At the blossom time only,

25
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:39,740
imagine, the times are so precarious that
the gardener has to worry that there should

26
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:50,420
not be a hailstorm! And all the satanic forces
have worked up in their fullest form, with

27
00:03:50,420 --> 00:04:01,590
their greatest strength, with all their tricks
and methods, to curb down the progress of

28
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:14,260
this creation into its fruitful happening.
At such [a] precarious time one has to be

29
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:23,450
very aware of all the dangers that we can
face.

30
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:31,040
The greatest danger comes to people when,
after getting realisation also, they do not

31
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,990
have faith in Sahaja Yoga. It’s the greatest
danger, because that’s your anchorage, that’s

32
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:46,670
the way you are saved. Say if there’s a
boat, which comes for your rescue, and you

33
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:52,130
are drowning and it rescues you, you see it,
you can feel it. Those who have not felt,

34
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:57,690
alright, but those who have felt it, you come
off the boat and then you do not believe in

35
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:04,540
the boat, you do not have faith in boat, that’s
the greatest danger you face.

36
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:14,550
People have faith in all kinds of nonsense
very easily, but to believe that you have

37
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:23,450
found the Reality, to believe that you can
be saved, is very difficult for people who

38
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:29,920
are all the time drowned and are threatened
and frightened. Because the habit is formed

39
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:45,030
to be always drowned, harassed, haunted, by
fears. So that habit doesn’t go and that

40
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:51,420
comes over and you feel frightened and you
lose faith in Sahaja Yoga. Whether you have

41
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:56,590
faith in it or not, it works. It works on
people who do not even have faith.

42
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:02,220
Today only I received a very interesting letter
from India and a man who is suppose to be

43
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:11,910
something big there. He told Me he read an
advertisement about Me, that Mataji is going

44
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:17,520
to give realisation through Kundalini awakening,
and he just came just to make fun of the whole

45
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:23,990
thing, to the program. And there he felt that
I was just befooling people, it is not possible,

46
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:34,220
he sat with a very skeptical ideas. But his
Kundalini rose and he felt the cool breeze

47
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,660
and he felt that calm and everything, he was
amazed. I don’t remember, he relays that

48
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:44,170
I came to him and he said, “Mother you are
so kind. Despite the fact I came with this

49
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:53,740
kind of idea you gave me realisation.” Because
Indians know what realisation means, here

50
00:06:53,740 --> 00:07:00,520
people even don’t know that, so the situation
is much worse. They know that realisation

51
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:07,710
means cool breeze, it means you must get cool
breeze flowing from you. They know it, you

52
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:15,600
do not know that. So the situation becomes
much worse here, that the faith in Sahaja

53
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:22,400
Yoga goes.
Now this is not blind faith. This is the faith.

54
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,450
One is blind faith and another is the faith,
means that you have now seen it and now you

55
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:33,040
have faith in it. It’s not like people,
many I have seen many people saying, “I

56
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:38,770
believe” and ” I believe” and “I believe”,
out of what? Is a thing that you have felt,

57
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:42,520
experienced, you have had it and then you
believe it. Of course you are not obliging

58
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:50,270
anybody by having faith, that’s one thing.
It’s the grace of God that has really been

59
00:07:50,270 --> 00:08:01,419
kind, extremely gracious, to grant this to
you. By that you do not oblige God or anybody,

60
00:08:01,419 --> 00:08:18,880
nor Me. But despite that, it’s time. What
grace, what grace, what beauty, what love.

61
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:29,720
It happens.
But this faith does not settle down. Now the

62
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:37,120
reasons for that are many, but is a very dangerous
thing. You can rationalise it. I’ve seen

63
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,979
people who go away, then again come back and
they said, “Mother we are sorry, I mean

64
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:47,380
we were, we just doubted You, went away this
that, I started thinking about it and I spoilt

65
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:54,450
it and I lost it, and I said ‘oh it was
just temporary,’ I went away.” Why not,

66
00:08:54,450 --> 00:09:03,750
once you get realisation settle down with
it for a while? Why not see for yourself what

67
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:11,380
it is? All the gurus who take money and have
made a money making proposition out of God,

68
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:19,200
which is absolutely against God, anti-Christ
and anti all that is Divine, people stick

69
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:25,560
onto them much more, like leeches.
One thing of course there is that they mesmerise,

70
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,800
there is no freedom, you cannot get out of
them, one thing, I agree. But the second is

71
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:35,070
the money. They get involved with them because
they have paid for it and they have to stick

72
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:39,740
onto it, because they have paid for it. And
so many people have told Me Mother you better

73
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:44,170
take money from everybody who comes in and
they will stick on. I mean this is going too

74
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:50,470
far. I have too much respect for humanity.
I respect you too much, I do not think you

75
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:55,180
could be that low, I cannot think, and those
who are that low cannot get realisation also

76
00:09:55,180 --> 00:10:03,680
perhaps. Maybe if you get it it’s not worth
it you see. We do not light lamps in paper

77
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:12,850
bags, do we? People have to be of some caliber
to get realisation.

78
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:22,880
But the faith, faith in Sahaja Yoga is the
only way you can rise and understand and move

79
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:36,589
and grow with it. The faith has to be so great
that nothing should disturb you. Look at these

80
00:10:36,589 --> 00:10:43,500
flowers sometimes, how delicate they are.
And it rains and sometimes it’s too sunny,

81
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:50,480
especially in London. You don’t know what
sort of a climate it is, it’s a funny climate

82
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:57,470
absolutely! But the flower to stand up to
that, because they have faith in the tree

83
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:10,520
on which they are born. That’s the strength-giving
thing. And to know it, fully, so that you

84
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:18,250
love it more and more and imbibe within you
more, is the only way you can really establish

85
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:30,399
yourself firmly into the strength of the Divine
Power.

86
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:43,589
The understanding of Sahaja Yoga is not mental
I told you yesterday, is not mental understanding.

87
00:11:43,589 --> 00:11:47,460
You cannot understand it through brains. If
you try to understand it through brains you

88
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:56,089
get away from it. Because you cannot explain
how it works out. It’s a miraculous thing,

89
00:11:56,089 --> 00:12:03,540
it’s a mystery. It’s a mystery. God is
a mystery for man, will remain a mystery to

90
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:11,220
a point, but he (man) can become His power.
He can become an instrument of His power.

91
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:18,600
So you cannot comprehend the complete thing
through your brains. You cannot even comprehend

92
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:27,290
a little bit through your brains. Only thing
is when you see it happening, you see it working

93
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:37,160
out, the effects of that experience which
are put on your brain, that gives you faith.

94
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:44,089
How do you have faith in a man? Say there
is a man who is very astute, straightforward.

95
00:12:44,089 --> 00:12:52,010
You give him ten pounds. He spends nine pounds
three pence, returns the rest to you. Then

96
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:58,480
you give some more money. Again he does the
same way; he returns all the money that is

97
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,680
due. By mistake he forgets, he again comes
and says, “This is it”. So you develop

98
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,670
that faith in him. It has not come out of
your intellectual understanding of the man.

99
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:14,459
A man may be very good, maybe a very great
cheat, could be a ‘very fine’ gentleman,

100
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:20,820
very well dressed. Mostly I have seen sometimes
when I see these pictures where they show

101
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:28,190
the bank robber especially the gentleman is
absolutely top class. He wears beautiful lined

102
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:34,910
dresses you see, he walks with an umbrella,
straight forward and he’s absolutely, you

103
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:41,830
can see his face and I mean it’s chiseled
completely: beautiful figure and extremely

104
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:48,610
innocent face and all that he puts it out
very well. That’s why he can befool you.

105
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:53,899
He can befool people very well and he can
get things out of them.

106
00:13:53,899 --> 00:14:08,870
But, in Sahaja Yoga, when you start feeling
it, seeing it, how it works, when you saw

107
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:15,290
this man, seeing the way he works you have
no faith in him anymore. You start seeing

108
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:24,220
how Sahaja Yoga works and then you have faith
in it. And that is faith, that is not reasoning.

109
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:29,500
Actually by reasoning you have achieved nothing
so far if you see it properly. For example,

110
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:40,240
you see, all scientific laws, were discovered,
were seen, were felt. Even if something comes

111
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:46,050
into my mind by thinking, it could be just
an imagination unless and until I see [that]

112
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:50,930
it works. Anything that does not work out
doesn’t become a law for us.

113
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:59,480
So for Sahaja Yoga you have to see it. But
not with the idea that, “Let me see if it

114
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:05,690
works or not”, that’s not the way, but
just the seeing of it and understanding it.

115
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:16,589
If you sit down and reason out, Sahaja Yoga
– you will be lost in wilderness absolutely!

116
00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:26,290
But how it works? I’ll give you a very simple
example. We have got the gentleman here, he

117
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:33,709
wrote a thesis. I don’t know how many years
he was working with it. He could not get through

118
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:40,880
it. He had not even made a bond out of it.
It’s a very material style of understanding

119
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:48,110
but still. So he came to Me and he said, “Mother
now I leave it at your feet and I surrender

120
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:50,329
it to You. Do whatever you please.” So I
looked at it. He said, “Are you not going

121
00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:57,370
to read it?” I said, “No need to read.”
I just put a little bandhan on it; put My

122
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:07,870
hand there, finished, that’s all. That’s
all I did. By next year he was a Dr., He was.

123
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:13,720
How it happens?
Today we received another letter from Portugal.

124
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:19,630
There was one fellow, whom we had sent all
the articles, everything, but he had certain

125
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:25,620
problems with his sister and mother and all
that, so he didn’t want to do much of Sahaja

126
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:30,990
Yoga. And was another one, who wanted to do
it. And he writes to Me saying that, “I

127
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,990
received everything. I don’t know. He does
not know my address. How it has come to me

128
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:39,230
I don’t know. Who has dropped it in my house?
I do not know how it has come to me; the address

129
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:43,220
was of that fellow.” And that gentleman
who has this address, does not know his address.

130
00:16:43,220 --> 00:17:01,690
It’s that mysterious. There are angels.
God has many hands, many eyes. He’s God

131
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:11,769
Almighty, He’s very powerful. So after Sahaja
yoga you cannot comprehend Him. You can only

132
00:17:11,769 --> 00:17:17,069
see Him at work and you can see His laws working
out and you can see it works out.

133
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:22,319
A simple thing there’s a gentlemen sitting
here, now you put your hand on that. There

134
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:28,139
was another case, very recently it happened,
one gentlemen came to Me and asked Me, “Why

135
00:17:28,139 --> 00:17:33,330
everybody is asking about my father? What’s
the matter?” I said, “Really? They’re

136
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:35,419
all asking about your father?” I went further
to tell him about his father and he was surprised.

137
00:17:35,419 --> 00:17:43,159
“How do you know?” I said, “I just know.”
“But,” he said, “how did they all know

138
00:17:43,159 --> 00:17:47,369
that there was something wrong with my father?”
I said, “There is a way of finding out.

139
00:17:47,369 --> 00:17:53,179
Everybody, even a little child knows it, something
wrong with your father.” So when he put

140
00:17:53,179 --> 00:17:58,590
his hands toward that gentleman the Right
Heart was catching, everybody’s Right Heart.

141
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:05,230
This is fathers. So he asked what’s wrong
with your father? Now see the mystery. You

142
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:11,840
see sahaja yogis also take it for granted.
See the mystery, the alertness of the vibrations,

143
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:17,100
just think of it, how they work it out, that
you just extend the hands at somebody and

144
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:23,090
the vibrations tell you this gentleman is
catching the right heart. The Mother has told

145
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:28,239
you that it means the father’s problem,
but that decoding I have done, but what about

146
00:18:28,239 --> 00:18:38,200
these? These vibrations they look so silent.
Do they think? How do they tell about anyone

147
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:44,330
who may not be here, present. You can tell.
And if Sahaja Yogis just start telling about

148
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:47,989
that person that, “This has happened, that
has happened, and this person has got this,

149
00:18:47,989 --> 00:18:52,059
and that person has got that.” Sitting down
here!

150
00:18:52,059 --> 00:19:02,629
It’s a tremendous dynamic force which is
working it out. But if you have no faith,

151
00:19:02,629 --> 00:19:10,299
then the same vibrations know that you have
no faith: They know you out and out, absolutely

152
00:19:10,299 --> 00:19:24,950
out and out, They know you too well. It is
They only who play around with you and put

153
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:34,749
you into problems, so that you realise that
you have been trying to cheat yourself. You

154
00:19:34,749 --> 00:19:45,690
are cheating your own Spirit. You are not
truthful to yours Self and it would be like

155
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:51,460
taking a dagger and putting it through and
being very happy, ‘Oh how I have cheated

156
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:59,730
myself.‘ It’s that foolish and stupid
I tell you. They know you too well. And they

157
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:09,769
just take you round and put you into a problem
to realise that, “Do not cheat anymore!”

158
00:20:09,769 --> 00:20:18,029
These dangers are there for all the people
who get realisation.

159
00:20:18,029 --> 00:20:22,529
And the another realisation one should have,
when you see others around here, the kind

160
00:20:22,529 --> 00:20:29,629
of people that come in. All kinds of people
have come. And when you start judging them

161
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:34,429
also you should know that if you become like
that, you will also have the same problem,

162
00:20:34,429 --> 00:20:39,570
even after realisation possibly. For example
some people start suddenly sulking in Sahaja

163
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:44,989
Yoga, say, after realisation, for nothing
at all. They should be, very aware of it immediately

164
00:20:44,989 --> 00:20:53,299
give it up, and become cheerful. Is there
a negative force pulling them down to sulk?

165
00:20:53,299 --> 00:21:04,159
First sign of being a Sahaja Yogi is to have
a very cheerful disposition. Look at the flowers,

166
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:11,609
look at them. Have you ever seen any flower
which is not dead [that’s] not cheerful?

167
00:21:11,609 --> 00:21:22,399
If they are even at the fag end of their life,
they’ll try to cheer you. That is the first

168
00:21:22,399 --> 00:21:35,729
sign, and all such signs should be expressed,
not artificially, but really spontaneously,

169
00:21:35,729 --> 00:21:41,850
from within.
And nothing should disturb you which is trivial,

170
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:48,159
useless. If you have faith in Sahaja Yoga,
then you must know you are here for a tremendous

171
00:21:48,159 --> 00:22:02,799
work of human emancipation. You have a very
great responsibility. You represent that part

172
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:13,830
of creation which is the most important, the
most vital. And if you fail it, it’s absolutely

173
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:31,859
fatal also.
All this works out in such a manner, that

174
00:22:31,859 --> 00:22:38,960
it builds up tremendous sense of security
within you, that you know you are standing

175
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:48,409
on the Truth. Hold it with both your hands;
you’ll grow on it. You’ll enjoy yourself.

176
00:22:48,409 --> 00:23:01,499
Life will be so much better, much more beautiful.
And it is only through you the whole world

177
00:23:01,499 --> 00:23:15,749
is going to be saved. So strengthen yourself,
strengthen your arms and strengthen your feet.

178
00:23:15,749 --> 00:23:23,220
The faith is the strength of Sahaja Yoga,
not the brainwaves that you have about it.

179
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:27,789
Of course you need it sometimes to argue with
some intellectuals, you see, as I’ve told

180
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:35,919
Gregoire to write the last two chapters for
all these “Rock of Gibraltars”. But, for

181
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:42,690
you the greatest thing is the faith, to enjoy
it, because you have seen it, you have known

182
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:50,840
it, you have found it. It is with you! You
are the master of it! It is at your service,

183
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:59,149
and so beautiful, so loving, so kind.
Maybe today is the last day, I’m here. I’m

184
00:23:59,149 --> 00:24:09,649
going now. I may not be here for one and a
half months or so. I hope so, I’ll be back,

185
00:24:09,649 --> 00:24:18,529
by the 17th of October or so. Whatever it
is, even if I am away or anything, Sahaja

186
00:24:18,529 --> 00:24:24,639
Yoga exists everywhere. Within you it is working,
without you it is working, everywhere it is

187
00:24:24,639 --> 00:24:32,919
working. So you see for yourself. To see it
you have to go and see people and meet them

188
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:35,979
and talk to them and find it out how it works.

189
00:24:35,979 --> 00:24:43,859
And develop that faith that gives you the
sense of security. There are so many ways

190
00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:49,099
of cleansing yourself, which you know, you
can find out. Meet each other. As many times

191
00:24:49,099 --> 00:24:55,359
as you can, call each other for tea, meet
each other, go around England. I was thinking

192
00:24:55,359 --> 00:25:01,489
when I’m out it would be better that you
go round to different centres, meet people,

193
00:25:01,489 --> 00:25:07,989
get organised, get more people. Tell them,
talk to them about it and do something.

194
00:25:07,989 --> 00:25:18,659
But they’ll judge you by your faith. And
when you have found out the Reality, the faith

195
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:29,629
should be much greater than any of these fanatics
have, any of these nonsensical people have.

196
00:25:29,629 --> 00:25:35,109
But for faith, you must have the quality.
Only people of quality can have that kind

197
00:25:35,109 --> 00:25:45,720
of faith, not ordinary people. They’ll fall
off. All the flowers do not get transformed

198
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:52,729
into the fruit state. You are transformed
into fruit state, but all the fruits do not

199
00:25:52,729 --> 00:26:03,529
come up to their maturity, because they lack
faith, the strength.

200
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:13,269
Gather up your strength. It’s all behind
you, it is within you, it’s around you.

201
00:26:13,269 --> 00:26:22,649
Everywhere there is light, within and without.
Try to work it out properly. Do not condemn

202
00:26:22,649 --> 00:26:27,820
yourself or condemn others, but know that
you are something that you are standing on

203
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:34,960
the Truth. And you are in for the Kingdom
of God, which is promised to you, which you

204
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:41,669
are in already walking in that. You are settled
in there, just enjoy that beauty.

205
00:26:41,669 --> 00:27:04,489
May God bless you all.
Is there any water for Me? Water? Now I would

206
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:09,799
like to know how many new people are there,
and, yes, just come forward those who are

207
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:13,999
new, and we’ll have a look at them. Those
who have come for the first time please come

208
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:20,999
in and then I would suggest, that those who
come for the first time, must, “please come”,

209
00:27:20,999 --> 00:27:29,899
must get to it, you see? It’s a serious
matter, you see, it’s not just a shopping

210
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:36,399
centre. It’s not guru shopping. It is your
own shopping I should say, it’s your own

211
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:45,529
being. So take to it seriously and work it
out properly. Ask others. Not that in any

212
00:27:45,529 --> 00:27:50,159
way they are higher or lower. Only thing,
they got their realisation before you came

213
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:57,349
to me. So it’s alright, doesn’t matter,
they’ll tell you what is to be done.

214
00:27:57,349 --> 00:28:05,159
In Sahaja Yoga there is no subscription, there
is no compulsion, there is no membership as

215
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:12,080
I told you. There is no way of aligning you
with Sahaja Yoga, no nothing. It’s your

216
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,759
freedom, complete freedom. Your freedom is
to be worshipped and to be respected if you

217
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:24,759
have to achieve the highest of the highest.
You have to be absolutely free because that

218
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:30,299
is the complete freedom you have to achieve.
So nobody is going to force you to do anything

219
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:38,799
or compel you to do anything. No! You are
left alone to yourself.

220
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:51,519
No doubt there is a Kundalini within you which
rises and there is in every human a possibility

221
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:59,639
of achieving realisation. Every human being
should receive realisation. But it’s a real

222
00:28:59,639 --> 00:29:11,179
work; it’s living work, and living work
takes time. If you people are of that caliber,

223
00:29:11,179 --> 00:29:21,269
you will become great fruits of this creation.
I will work as much as I can to keep you up

224
00:29:21,269 --> 00:29:27,809
there, all my level best. I’ve worked very
hard and I’ll always work, and all of them

225
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:39,549
are willing to help you out. They have no
problem. You too become like them, very soon.

226
00:29:39,549 --> 00:29:45,070
Now about Kundalini I must have spoken I don’t
know how many times and there are lots of

227
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:50,529
tapes with us. It’s all again intellectual
feat, you see? Let’s see if the light is

228
00:29:50,529 --> 00:29:54,840
there, let us see the light, then we’ll
talk about it, isn’t it? I mean if I have

229
00:29:54,840 --> 00:30:00,019
to put the lights on I have to just press
the button. That’s what it is really, because

230
00:30:00,019 --> 00:30:05,719
it’s all built in. Once it happens to you
then you ask Me about the engineering, it’s

231
00:30:05,719 --> 00:30:09,840
better, than to have the headache before and
then the light.

232
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:17,509
So let’s work it out that way, then later
on you can go through, you can find out for

233
00:30:17,509 --> 00:30:26,349
yourself how it works, what is the system
that works it out, what is God’s plan for

234
00:30:26,349 --> 00:30:33,539
us, everything. Gradually you see it for yourself
that this is the baptism that is promised

235
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:41,429
to you, this is the real re-birth that has
been prophesised before, this is the time

236
00:30:41,429 --> 00:30:50,389
that is promised that somebody will come and
do this job for you. And it is here, that

237
00:30:50,389 --> 00:30:53,820
you receive it.

238
00:30:53,820 --> 00:31:00,859
No religion is to be condemned because they
are different steps in your growth, but, you

239
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:10,149
should know what is real and what is unreal,
that’s very important. Once you learn this

240
00:31:10,149 --> 00:31:17,529
science of God’s ways, then you start talking
about it. Before that you just see for yourself.

241
00:31:17,529 --> 00:31:25,190
Be just witnesses and achieve something out
of it, and make the best.

242
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:29,269
May God bless you all
Now let’s have the feet like that straight,

243
00:31:29,269 --> 00:31:38,979
just like that. Just like that, yes. And put
your hands towards Me. For anything small

244
00:31:38,979 --> 00:31:43,200
just do not get disturbed. Keep your eyes
shut. If you can put your hands on the lap

245
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,129
it’s alright, because you’ll be comfortable.
Be comfortable! If you have any discomfort

246
00:31:48,129 --> 00:31:52,029
in the stomach or anything tightness you can
loosen it, and it’s for your comfort only.

247
00:31:52,029 --> 00:31:56,179
I want you to be comfortable. That one thing
is that you should be comfortable bodily.

248
00:31:56,179 --> 00:32:00,649
Though the Kundalini’s such a sweet thing,
She’s your Mother, and She rises without

249
00:32:00,649 --> 00:32:04,570
giving any trouble.

250
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:13,399
Now close your eyes. Just close your eyes.
Everyone.

251
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:25,539
Aank ke band kar lijiye (Hindi: close your
eyes)

252
00:32:25,539 --> 00:32:35,369
Now there are some centres within us, they
might get a little obstructed, supposing you

253
00:32:35,369 --> 00:32:39,729
feel guilty for nothing at all, I mean there’s
nothing to feel guilty you see? You are facing

254
00:32:39,729 --> 00:32:46,859
somebody who is love, so how can you feel
guilty before such a person who is just love?

255
00:32:46,859 --> 00:32:57,190
So have no guilt of any kind. Then you have
to forgive. You have to forgive all the people.

256
00:32:57,190 --> 00:33:02,119
Not to bear any bitterness just now, just
forgive, because by bearing that bitterness

257
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:08,700
you really embitter yourself, you do not torture
the other person. And lastly you have to ask

258
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:15,830
for forgiveness, if you have done any mistake
by ignorance or anything. You just ask for

259
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:27,019
simple forgiveness.
All the obstructions can be overcome by the

260
00:33:27,019 --> 00:33:35,929
rising Kundalini, She does that. Just relax.
It will happen by itself, you are not to do

261
00:33:35,929 --> 00:33:41,559
anything. Keep your attention absolutely loose,
if there are thoughts, let them come, don’t

262
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:45,929
worry, they will stop themselves. You don’t
have to stop them. Do not put in any effort,

263
00:33:45,929 --> 00:33:52,529
just leave it alone. It will work out. It
will just rise and work it out. You just leave

264
00:33:52,529 --> 00:34:26,600
it alone.
Suddenly the thoughts stop. But you are aware,

265
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:30,510
you are not sleeping, you are not in a trance
or anything you are absolutely aware, but

266
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:39,710
you reach a point where there are no thoughts.
But do not try to do that. Do not try to do

267
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:43,899
that. And when the Kundalini pierces the fontanelle
bone area, the talu, you start getting cool

268
00:34:43,899 --> 00:34:43,899
breeze in the hands. In both the hands you
start getting cool breeze and also from your

269
00:34:43,899 --> 00:34:43,899
head, you start getting cool breeze. First
a hot breeze I think and then the cool breeze,

270
00:34:43,899 --> 00:34:43,909
for many people it happens like that, doesn’t
matter.

271
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:43,909
Good you see, you can feel it on his head,
here. You have a breathing trouble have you?

272
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:43,919
Do you have a breathing problem normally?
Do you have any breathing problem? Hmm? No

273
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:43,919
just don’t breathe, just leave it alone.
Just.. Don’t you think it is too much breathing

274
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:43,919
or is it automatically it happens? Happening
automatically. This ever happens before?

275
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:43,919
Seeker: No.
Shri Mataji: It never happened before you

276
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:43,929
say? Hmm? You have been to some guru or someone?
You’ll be all right. It will work out. You’re

277
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:43,929
all right. You’ll be all right. Is he, is
he all right? Are you all right? How are you

278
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:43,929
feeling?

279
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:43,940
Seeker: I’m feeling hot on the right.

280
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:43,940
Shri Mataji: Eh? Can you sit there? Would
be better nearby. Let’s look at her. Just

281
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:43,940
look after her. Just sit down. You’re all
right. Now what about her? Can you see? After
