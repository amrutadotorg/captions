00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:16,779
Shri Ganesha Puja, Cabella,
15th September, 1991

2
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:42,482
Today is the happiest day for all of you,
for the whole universe, because Shri Ganesha

3
00:00:42,482 --> 00:00:44,222
was created.

4
00:00:44,222 --> 00:00:57,802
He was created to emit auspiciousness through
His Chaitanya [- Divine Vibrations –ed.].

5
00:00:57,802 --> 00:01:07,071
First, the whole cosmos was filled with this
Chaitanyasrishti [- creation of Divine Vibrations

6
00:01:07,071 --> 00:01:08,071
–ed.].

7
00:01:08,071 --> 00:01:16,731
Then Brahmadeva came into play, and He created
all the matter.

8
00:01:16,731 --> 00:01:33,662
But

9
00:01:33,662 --> 00:01:54,862
the greatest blessings of the Divine Power
was to symbolize Chaitanya, and this Chaitanya

10
00:01:54,862 --> 00:02:04,482
has many aspects, but specially in Shri Ganesha,
it is auspiciousness.

11
00:02:04,482 --> 00:02:11,372
In these modern times people have lost the
sense of auspiciousness.

12
00:02:11,372 --> 00:02:18,892
Everything that emits vibrations, Chaitanya,
is auspicious, is shubh, and whatever does

13
00:02:18,892 --> 00:02:25,562
not is not by any chance auspicious.

14
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:35,182
So first of all, whatever you worship, whatever
you accept, all of them have to be auspicious

15
00:02:35,182 --> 00:02:37,002
things.

16
00:02:37,002 --> 00:02:46,381
Every shape has a coefficience and all these
shapes which you see, not necessarily give

17
00:02:46,381 --> 00:02:48,271
vibrations.

18
00:02:48,271 --> 00:02:56,232
But in the human beings also, we find there
are many people, like you, who have Chaitanya

19
00:02:56,232 --> 00:02:58,101
flowing in them.

20
00:02:58,101 --> 00:03:05,551
But this Chaitanya when it flows, we just
take Shri Ganesha for granted.

21
00:03:05,551 --> 00:03:10,812
We do not understand that we have to awaken
Shri Ganesha within us.

22
00:03:10,812 --> 00:03:11,812
Means what?

23
00:03:11,812 --> 00:03:13,902
What we have to do?

24
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:22,862
There is Shri Ganesha already existing in
you and as I said that innocence cannot be

25
00:03:22,862 --> 00:03:30,682
lost, so Shri Ganesha is eternal being, eternal
child – He cannot be lost and He cannot

26
00:03:30,682 --> 00:03:32,342
be destroyed.

27
00:03:32,342 --> 00:03:34,571
So He’s all the time there.

28
00:03:34,571 --> 00:03:48,611
Maybe some clouds of your ill doings are covering
the great personality of innocence.

29
00:03:48,611 --> 00:03:54,521
But it is always there present.

30
00:03:54,521 --> 00:04:02,821
So now, what should we do to keep this Ganesha
all the time shining within us?

31
00:04:02,821 --> 00:04:12,081
Is to first remember that you were made in
the same pattern as Shri Ganesh.

32
00:04:12,081 --> 00:04:21,622
But His Kundalini is on His stomach; His pure
desire is on His stomach.

33
00:04:21,622 --> 00:04:34,152
It’s very significant to understand why
it is there that His Kundalini is on His stomach.

34
00:04:34,152 --> 00:04:46,332
That means He does not have to conquer the
temptations of Mooladhara at all.

35
00:04:46,332 --> 00:04:55,562
But He has His Kundalini on His stomach, that
means He is also beyond the temptations of

36
00:04:55,562 --> 00:05:14,462
food, of power or anything because His stomach
represents absolute abandonment, absolute

37
00:05:14,462 --> 00:05:15,642
freedom.

38
00:05:15,642 --> 00:05:22,962
He’s not bothered as to how He looks that…
these days there is a big fashion that you

39
00:05:22,962 --> 00:05:24,082
cannot have a big belly.

40
00:05:24,082 --> 00:05:32,472
I mean this is becoming a big… not only
fashion but a big business.

41
00:05:32,472 --> 00:05:35,602
But as age grows, you have to have it.

42
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:42,732
Even small children have that and they look
so sweet.

43
00:05:42,732 --> 00:05:50,592
Those people who are very thin must understand
that they might be getting some prizes in

44
00:05:50,592 --> 00:06:05,722
the… maybe beauty contest or something,
but they do not have that majesty, that royalty,

45
00:06:05,722 --> 00:06:10,402
that dignity in them as they should have.

46
00:06:10,402 --> 00:06:14,002
So Shri Ganesha accepts everything.

47
00:06:14,002 --> 00:06:20,772
He has a head with a trunk.

48
00:06:20,772 --> 00:06:23,342
He accepts it.

49
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:26,612
Of course, is important, He should have that.

50
00:06:26,612 --> 00:06:32,562
Because head of the elephant suggests that
He is not like a human being who develops

51
00:06:32,562 --> 00:06:42,392
ego, superego, conditionings, but He is just
all the time one with the Divine.

52
00:06:42,392 --> 00:06:48,832
He accepts His body, He accepts His head,
He accepts His ears, He accepts everything

53
00:06:48,832 --> 00:06:51,902
that He is made of.

54
00:06:51,902 --> 00:07:00,272
He doesn’t aspire to something – some
entrepreneurs put some ideas and He wouldn’t

55
00:07:00,272 --> 00:07:02,212
go run after them.

56
00:07:02,212 --> 00:07:10,972
He won’t try to change Himself; He won’t
try to create that fashion and all that.

57
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:23,772
He is what He is… because He is a satisfied
soul.

58
00:07:23,772 --> 00:07:37,372
The Kundalini on the stomach shows a complete,
self-contented, satisfied personality of Shri

59
00:07:37,372 --> 00:07:39,342
Ganesha.

60
00:07:39,342 --> 00:07:49,952
When you have all the powers within you, you
know you are powerful, then you don’t hanker

61
00:07:49,952 --> 00:08:00,142
after all these things and you don’t try
to make a position or an impression of others.

62
00:08:00,142 --> 00:08:09,292
For example, He would never go and read books
like how to impress people.

63
00:08:09,292 --> 00:08:15,012
Very common.

64
00:08:15,012 --> 00:08:23,592
So now, as you are created in the same image
of Shri Ganesh, you have to understand that

65
00:08:23,592 --> 00:08:31,852
you have to accept whatever God has given
you, whatever position He has given you.

66
00:08:31,852 --> 00:08:33,342
Same with Christ.

67
00:08:33,342 --> 00:08:38,582
Christ accepted His father who was just a
carpenter.

68
00:08:38,582 --> 00:08:45,122
He didn’t aspire for something higher or
some sort of a special position or a power

69
00:08:45,122 --> 00:08:55,612
because He was so powerful – what more power
can He have?

70
00:08:55,612 --> 00:09:02,662
Though people mocked at Him and laughed at
Him and could not accept what He was saying,

71
00:09:02,662 --> 00:09:10,072
but still He was self-contented, self-satisfied.

72
00:09:10,072 --> 00:09:12,192
He knew what it was.

73
00:09:12,192 --> 00:09:22,742
So, for a Sahaja Yogi first thing is to be
self-contented.

74
00:09:22,742 --> 00:09:33,372
As I told you, the fundamentals of the western
life is to see and to be seen.

75
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:44,382
Both things were missing completely in the
incarnation of Shri Ganesh.

76
00:09:44,382 --> 00:09:49,822
So when I say these things, suddenly people
start thinking, “Let us become hippies,

77
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:55,052
or let them become punks, or let us become
this, let us become that.”

78
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:56,992
You don’t have to become anything.

79
00:09:56,992 --> 00:10:04,202
Whatever you have – your body, your face,
your hair – everything is there, just meant

80
00:10:04,202 --> 00:10:09,432
for you.

81
00:10:09,432 --> 00:10:24,062
You don’t have to change anything outwardly
because inside is complete Chaitanya.

82
00:10:24,062 --> 00:10:30,202
Shri Ganesha never tried to change Himself.

83
00:10:30,202 --> 00:10:45,312
Though there were so many clouds on His being,
though many people insulted Him, tortured

84
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:55,292
Him, hanged Him, crucified Him, still the
Eternal Being didn’t bother.

85
00:10:55,292 --> 00:11:08,792
So the first and foremost thing for a Sahaja
Yogi is to accept, go on accepting things.

86
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:13,972
But when I say accept, I must say the other
side also: that doesn’t mean you start accepting

87
00:11:13,972 --> 00:11:18,652
bhoots, all the bad qualities of others.

88
00:11:18,652 --> 00:11:24,832
“Mother, You said you must accept”, so
they’ll start accepting all these bad qualities.

89
00:11:24,832 --> 00:11:26,152
“What’s wrong?

90
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:28,882
You have said it already.”

91
00:11:28,882 --> 00:11:33,302
Whatever I say has another side, always.

92
00:11:33,302 --> 00:11:37,502
Like I said, “Now you have become your own
Guru.”

93
00:11:37,502 --> 00:11:41,242
So, “Why should we listen to anybody else?”

94
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:57,902
Like this, you see, we go on diverting ourselves,
deviating ourselves from reality just to cheat

95
00:11:57,902 --> 00:12:00,062
ourselves.

96
00:12:00,062 --> 00:12:05,232
And this comes because we have no wisdom.

97
00:12:05,232 --> 00:12:11,612
We have no wisdom because we do not know what
is for our benevolence, what is for our good,

98
00:12:11,612 --> 00:12:13,182
what we should do for our good.

99
00:12:13,182 --> 00:12:17,112
I mean even if we know, we don’t want to
do it.

100
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:20,402
So, what we lack is wisdom.

101
00:12:20,402 --> 00:12:25,831
That’s a vicious circle, I must say, that
Ganesha is to be awakened to give you wisdom

102
00:12:25,831 --> 00:12:36,362
– He is the giver of wisdom, He is the giver
of wisdom – and He has to give you the wisdom,

103
00:12:36,362 --> 00:12:41,512
He is to be awakened; but you are not wise
because He is not awakened.

104
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:47,281
It’s a very vicious circle.

105
00:12:47,281 --> 00:12:50,822
How to make this vicious circle break?

106
00:12:50,822 --> 00:12:57,252
That “Let my wisdom shine in my attention.

107
00:12:57,252 --> 00:13:06,142
Let Shri Ganesha throw His light in my attention.”

108
00:13:06,142 --> 00:13:11,882
Mentally you people are very alert, no doubt.

109
00:13:11,882 --> 00:13:21,472
And you can always cheat yourself nicely.

110
00:13:21,472 --> 00:13:33,312
That’s the point where you could see yourself
– introspection, which I have seen among

111
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:37,612
Russians.

112
00:13:37,612 --> 00:13:41,922
Just introspect: “Why do I do like that?

113
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:45,031
Why cannot I meditate?

114
00:13:45,031 --> 00:13:50,832
Am I going to miss out?

115
00:13:50,832 --> 00:13:59,252
Why can I not do something that is good for
me?”

116
00:13:59,252 --> 00:14:09,392
Introspection is the only way you can see
yourself how far you are from Shri Ganesh.

117
00:14:09,392 --> 00:14:21,252
Even, I have seen, when I say something in
general, people always – the mind is very

118
00:14:21,252 --> 00:14:26,832
clever – thinks that I am talking about
somebody else, not about them.

119
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:35,552
It’s a convex mind, convex, which never
receives anything inside itself because there

120
00:14:35,552 --> 00:14:40,952
is no wisdom.

121
00:14:40,952 --> 00:14:51,502
If you are wise, then not only that you’ll
accept but you’ll understand and it will

122
00:14:51,502 --> 00:14:57,342
penetrate into your attention through your
central nervous system.

123
00:14:57,342 --> 00:15:00,982
You just know that this is it.

124
00:15:00,982 --> 00:15:08,803
Now you know that this… you put your hand
towards this candle, it… you’ll… your

125
00:15:08,803 --> 00:15:09,932
fingers might burn.

126
00:15:09,932 --> 00:15:15,892
You know it definitely, with experience, and
you won’t do that.

127
00:15:15,892 --> 00:15:24,302
With experience you have learnt not to put
your hand on to the candle.

128
00:15:24,302 --> 00:15:29,972
And this wisdom is there, I don’t have to
tell you that.

129
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:33,872
But this is a new life you have started – a
spiritual life.

130
00:15:33,872 --> 00:15:42,672
When you are going into the spiritual life,
try to remember your experiences, one after

131
00:15:42,672 --> 00:15:48,232
another: how you got transformed, how you
changed, how many the bad things that you

132
00:15:48,232 --> 00:15:53,252
had disappeared gradually and how you have
become so nice.

133
00:15:53,252 --> 00:16:01,972
This will take away your depression – to
begin with.

134
00:16:01,972 --> 00:16:06,382
Then you should think that, “What do I have
to do further?

135
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,642
Am I really wise, or I’m stupid?”

136
00:16:07,642 --> 00:16:17,792
There are lots of stages between absolute
stupidity and absolute wisdom, and you see

137
00:16:17,792 --> 00:16:28,432
all those shades all over, and combinations
and permutations of these I see every day.

138
00:16:28,432 --> 00:16:40,022
And I am surprised that after getting your
Self Realization, when Shri Ganesha is shining

139
00:16:40,022 --> 00:16:48,262
in your attention, you should see your reflection
clearly and try to correct it.

140
00:16:48,262 --> 00:16:57,262
Only this much wisdom if you have that, “I
have to work out my benevolence”, you’ll

141
00:16:57,262 --> 00:17:00,341
do it.

142
00:17:00,341 --> 00:17:06,531
I know of somebody who would never get up
in the mornings, say for example.

143
00:17:06,531 --> 00:17:11,972
But one day I saw him ready at about six o’clock
in the morning – I was surprised.

144
00:17:11,972 --> 00:17:17,451
How this gentleman who has no self-discipline
has suddenly got up at six o’clock and ready

145
00:17:17,451 --> 00:17:19,152
to go somewhere.

146
00:17:19,152 --> 00:17:23,282
I said, “Where are you going?”

147
00:17:23,282 --> 00:17:25,682
“You don’t know?”

148
00:17:25,682 --> 00:17:26,682
I said, “What?”

149
00:17:26,682 --> 00:17:33,591
“I have got a job now and I have to be present
at 8 o’clock and it will take two hours

150
00:17:33,591 --> 00:17:34,792
to reach that place.

151
00:17:34,792 --> 00:17:36,811
Also, I am keeping some margin.

152
00:17:36,811 --> 00:17:38,352
So I have to leave now.

153
00:17:38,352 --> 00:17:40,502
I can’t talk to You even.”

154
00:17:40,502 --> 00:17:45,112
Quite alert, awake.

155
00:17:45,112 --> 00:17:54,742
Now, what is the thing is as far as money
is concerned, lot of wisdom is there.

156
00:17:54,742 --> 00:18:02,592
Don’t have to tell them, that is automatically.

157
00:18:02,592 --> 00:18:13,722
Money wisdom is quite a lot, job wisdom is
quite a lot.

158
00:18:13,722 --> 00:18:25,892
Because these things means prestige in the
society, this means security in the society.

159
00:18:25,892 --> 00:18:32,272
So this kind of business you find in many
people and in some even that is missing.

160
00:18:32,272 --> 00:18:37,692
They don’t even understand that they have
to earn their living.

161
00:18:37,692 --> 00:18:47,612
But that’s the minimum, you cannot be parasite.

162
00:18:47,612 --> 00:18:53,852
Then the second stage, as I said by many stages,
is this: that we are not for money, money

163
00:18:53,852 --> 00:19:03,492
is for us.

164
00:19:03,492 --> 00:19:16,272
The attention if it is on your Spirit, on
the Ganesha Principle, then whole situation

165
00:19:16,272 --> 00:19:19,082
will change.

166
00:19:19,082 --> 00:19:24,702
Your priorities will change.

167
00:19:24,702 --> 00:19:28,932
And suddenly people will say, “Mother, what
has happened to this gentleman?

168
00:19:28,932 --> 00:19:40,482
He was a stupid fool, now he has become such
a wise person.”

169
00:19:40,482 --> 00:19:45,482
So to awaken Shri Ganesha you should have
minimum wisdom already there.

170
00:19:45,482 --> 00:19:50,012
I mean, even if that is not there, how can
you work it out?

171
00:19:50,012 --> 00:19:58,962
Is not meant for stupid people, Moodhas, not
meant for Moodh.

172
00:19:58,962 --> 00:20:01,932
So now what is our benevolence is?

173
00:20:01,932 --> 00:20:06,932
Let us see.

174
00:20:06,932 --> 00:20:08,762
Is it money?

175
00:20:08,762 --> 00:20:10,352
No.

176
00:20:10,352 --> 00:20:18,232
Those who have money don’t seem to be very
happy people always.

177
00:20:18,232 --> 00:20:19,902
Then what is the next, is jobs?

178
00:20:19,902 --> 00:20:25,232
Those who have jobs – all right, should
have jobs, I am not saying you should be jobless.

179
00:20:25,232 --> 00:20:32,772
I mean immediately the another side they will
take, I mean so quick you know, that, “Mother

180
00:20:32,772 --> 00:20:40,762
is saying we can be jobless you see, nice.”

181
00:20:40,762 --> 00:20:42,542
Immediate, escapes.

182
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:50,402
Now, then the power: you want to have political
power, this social power, this power, that

183
00:20:50,402 --> 00:20:57,222
power – is absolutely a joyless pursuit.

184
00:20:57,222 --> 00:21:05,212
You go and see those people who are supposed
to be powerful, so called, half way they are

185
00:21:05,212 --> 00:21:15,801
towards hell, one foot there and one foot
here and about to be gulped down by the crocodiles.

186
00:21:15,801 --> 00:21:21,921
You can see it clearly.

187
00:21:21,921 --> 00:21:28,051
Specially in this Kali Yuga it’s so obvious,
so clear-cut.

188
00:21:28,051 --> 00:21:36,252
We don’t want to be like them, we want to
be like Shri Ganesh.

189
00:21:36,252 --> 00:21:42,272
So once you start accepting your circumstances,
accepting your body, your… accepting your

190
00:21:42,272 --> 00:22:00,431
face, everything, you will see that lot of
time will be saved.

191
00:22:00,431 --> 00:22:10,772
Another problem that faces us is planning.

192
00:22:10,772 --> 00:22:14,192
And that is missing in Shri Ganesha completely.

193
00:22:14,192 --> 00:22:16,802
He did not do any planning whatsoever.

194
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:24,002
I wish He had done some planning, things would
have been much better.

195
00:22:24,002 --> 00:22:30,752
He doesn’t believe in planning because He
is so powerful.

196
00:22:30,752 --> 00:22:35,212
Whatever He wants, He can get it done.

197
00:22:35,212 --> 00:22:36,212
You want the sun?

198
00:22:36,212 --> 00:22:38,292
All right the sun is there.

199
00:22:38,292 --> 00:22:39,292
You want the moon?

200
00:22:39,292 --> 00:22:40,292
Moon is there.

201
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:41,292
You want the stars?

202
00:22:41,292 --> 00:22:42,292
Stars is there.

203
00:22:42,292 --> 00:22:53,782
The
dust of His feet can create the whole universe

204
00:22:53,782 --> 00:22:59,472
– universes after universes.

205
00:22:59,472 --> 00:23:11,472
For such a person, there is no need to be
planning everything because whatever He wants

206
00:23:11,472 --> 00:23:14,482
happens.

207
00:23:14,482 --> 00:23:17,532
But why, why it happens?

208
00:23:17,532 --> 00:23:22,242
Why He has this power?

209
00:23:22,242 --> 00:23:26,561
Because He is in that state.

210
00:23:26,561 --> 00:23:35,072
Are you in that state?

211
00:23:35,072 --> 00:23:38,042
You have not achieved that state.

212
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:48,752
You talk somebody… tell somebody that, “Oh
my, I have to go and catch the plane.”

213
00:23:48,752 --> 00:23:54,152
There are ten people standing next to you,
they’ll all get panicky.

214
00:23:54,152 --> 00:24:01,301
I have to go, and they are bothered; something
sort of goes off their heads.

215
00:24:01,301 --> 00:24:05,181
I don’t know what goes, they go amuck.

216
00:24:05,181 --> 00:24:06,632
I never tell them like that.

217
00:24:06,632 --> 00:24:12,062
I say, “There’s still time for the plane
to go, and don’t worry.

218
00:24:12,062 --> 00:24:20,912
When I reach there then the plane will leave
so you don’t worry.”

219
00:24:20,912 --> 00:24:34,222
But because of this kind of a… presumptions,
and the planning system of the mind, you just

220
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:39,222
think that, “Now I have a plan to go today,
I must go.”

221
00:24:39,222 --> 00:24:40,222
Why?

222
00:24:40,222 --> 00:24:42,512
I won’t go.

223
00:24:42,512 --> 00:24:45,102
I may decide at the last minute I don’t
want to go.

224
00:24:45,102 --> 00:24:47,552
I’ll make the plane go away.

225
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:52,602
We did that many a times, you know very well.

226
00:24:52,602 --> 00:25:00,412
I wanted to buy the Rome Ashram, so I saw
to it that the plane never arrived.

227
00:25:00,412 --> 00:25:05,412
But you have to be in that state.

228
00:25:05,412 --> 00:25:08,642
Specially buying this Cabella, you know what
happened.

229
00:25:08,642 --> 00:25:16,712
There were five great intellectuals on My
head sitting.

230
00:25:16,712 --> 00:25:21,602
I didn’t know how I will manage these five
intellectuals with all their planning, this,

231
00:25:21,602 --> 00:25:30,982
that; they made Me run up and down, do this
and that, Ultimately they all had to come

232
00:25:30,982 --> 00:25:32,992
here.

233
00:25:32,992 --> 00:25:35,032
But I was telling them, “Go and have a look.”

234
00:25:35,032 --> 00:25:46,532
Nobody would look at it, nobody would listen
to Me, nobody wanted to know about it.

235
00:25:46,532 --> 00:25:59,532
How things work out – is your pure desire
that can work out anything that you want.

236
00:25:59,532 --> 00:26:03,452
But you won’t want funny things also.

237
00:26:03,452 --> 00:26:08,442
Like Shri Ganesha would not like to follow
some entrepreneur who is saying, “Have a

238
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:12,171
punk on your head”, or something.

239
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:16,602
Is stupidity, all kinds of stupidities.

240
00:26:16,602 --> 00:26:22,752
Because you are stupid, these entrepreneurs
are having a good time; they can befool us

241
00:26:22,752 --> 00:26:25,342
all the time.

242
00:26:25,342 --> 00:26:37,682
At His state, He is Himself, on top of the
pure desire.

243
00:26:37,682 --> 00:26:43,642
The pure desire is on His stomach, tied up
nicely.

244
00:26:43,642 --> 00:27:01,032
It is to be seen in Sahaja Yoga how things
work out, how miraculously they work out,

245
00:27:01,032 --> 00:27:03,452
and these can happen to you also.

246
00:27:03,452 --> 00:27:10,082
All these Powers can come to you also.

247
00:27:10,082 --> 00:27:15,342
You know about some people who came to us
who didn’t know even how to sing.

248
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:19,662
I mean, they had no voices; something very
funny they had – I mean I didn’t know

249
00:27:19,662 --> 00:27:25,291
from where they learnt to even talk.

250
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:30,902
When they opened their mouths, if you were
at one note, they were on another note and

251
00:27:30,902 --> 00:27:36,472
they went on and on and on without even listening
to what they were singing.

252
00:27:36,472 --> 00:27:44,542
After some time, I find they are singing beautifully.

253
00:27:44,542 --> 00:27:49,342
So the Kundalini itself is working it out,
the pure desire is working it out, but what

254
00:27:49,342 --> 00:27:50,872
about you?

255
00:27:50,872 --> 00:27:57,192
What are you doing about it is to be seen.

256
00:27:57,192 --> 00:28:10,732
There are so many things that could be understood
very easily through the lifestyle of Shri

257
00:28:10,732 --> 00:28:11,742
Ganesha.

258
00:28:11,742 --> 00:28:26,301
The first and foremost thing for Him is to
obey His Mother – never to say no, no question,

259
00:28:26,301 --> 00:28:35,472
and also not to ask why.

260
00:28:35,472 --> 00:28:43,622
He will go and fight with all the Gods and
Goddesses and every one.

261
00:28:43,622 --> 00:28:50,752
And that’s what Christ has said, “Anything
against Me I’ve tolerated but nothing against

262
00:28:50,752 --> 00:28:55,411
the Holy Ghost.”

263
00:28:55,411 --> 00:29:10,102
There should be no question, there should
be no explanation.

264
00:29:10,102 --> 00:29:19,482
Sometimes even My patience goes out, the way
they do not want to accept what I am telling

265
00:29:19,482 --> 00:29:20,482
them.

266
00:29:20,482 --> 00:29:25,532
At the end of course they all come around,
no doubt – at the end.

267
00:29:25,532 --> 00:29:28,892
But you waste so much time convincing them.

268
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:32,152
What is the reason?

269
00:29:32,152 --> 00:29:35,932
They have no wisdom to know what their Mother
is.

270
00:29:35,932 --> 00:29:45,152
Like, you know the story of Shri Ganesha that
His Mother said, “The one who goes round

271
00:29:45,152 --> 00:29:51,041
the Mother Earth, I will give you a present.”

272
00:29:51,041 --> 00:30:02,161
So, Ganesha again accepts a little mouse as
a transport – imagine.

273
00:30:02,161 --> 00:30:08,632
Nowadays people can’t believe it that Shri
Ganesha, so powerful, should accept just a

274
00:30:08,632 --> 00:30:11,102
mouse for His transport.

275
00:30:11,102 --> 00:30:22,852
Because He’s so humble; he doesn’t have
to show off His Lincoln or Mercedes to anyone;

276
00:30:22,852 --> 00:30:29,112
He is very comfortable with His mouse.

277
00:30:29,112 --> 00:30:32,402
Now what does He do?

278
00:30:32,402 --> 00:30:35,392
He thinks that…

279
00:30:35,392 --> 00:30:42,292
He understands, in no time, that His Mother
is much greater than the Mother Earth.

280
00:30:42,292 --> 00:30:46,811
“So why should I go round the Mother Earth?”

281
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:54,252
His brother is going round on a peacock.

282
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:59,462
He just goes round His Mother – He gets
the present.

283
00:30:59,462 --> 00:31:14,022
It’s such a simple thing to understand because
He is the wisest person.

284
00:31:14,022 --> 00:31:30,672
The wisest person knows what is what, he knows
who is who, he knows what are the qualities

285
00:31:30,672 --> 00:31:32,782
of these persons.

286
00:31:32,782 --> 00:31:43,712
He is not impressed by superficial things,
no.

287
00:31:43,712 --> 00:31:51,842
If somebody is well dressed, then people get
very much impressed by them, and they turn

288
00:31:51,842 --> 00:32:05,082
out to be bank robbers – walking with umbrellas
and with lined suits, as if some big executives

289
00:32:05,082 --> 00:32:15,472
are coming, and they decamp with all the loot.

290
00:32:15,472 --> 00:32:27,882
So for a wise person, the superficial behavior
doesn’t appeal, not bothered.

291
00:32:27,882 --> 00:32:43,531
It is a kind of a very penetrating intelligence;
just like a computer you know.

292
00:32:43,531 --> 00:32:45,872
In a second you know that what is this gentleman.

293
00:32:45,872 --> 00:32:53,051
Oh, he may come with a great, you see, ado
and he might come and praise you and do this

294
00:32:53,051 --> 00:33:02,612
and do that and you know the person very well.

295
00:33:02,612 --> 00:33:13,442
If some body is unduly very friendly, very
kind, very nice, not necessarily that he is

296
00:33:13,442 --> 00:33:24,051
really appreciating you but he is looking
at your purse, maybe, maybe something else.

297
00:33:24,051 --> 00:33:33,561
But not only on this level, it is even on
a spiritual level we have to understand how

298
00:33:33,561 --> 00:33:45,592
people try to put you down spiritually; what
they try, what tricks they try on you.

299
00:33:45,592 --> 00:33:53,632
It could be your husband, your wife, your
children, your relations, your friends, anybody,

300
00:33:53,632 --> 00:33:55,702
any Sahaja Yogi.

301
00:33:55,702 --> 00:33:58,722
But in the case of Shri Ganesha, it’s the
other way round.

302
00:33:58,722 --> 00:34:05,122
They say that if you put one apple, bad apple,
all the apples get spoilt.

303
00:34:05,122 --> 00:34:16,402
But if you put Shri Ganesha among all the
bad apples, they’ll get all right.

304
00:34:16,402 --> 00:34:21,382
Because He’s the life-giving force.

305
00:34:21,382 --> 00:34:37,372
This is one of the greatest qualities, that
He knows that He is the source of life and

306
00:34:37,372 --> 00:34:40,772
He gives life, He gives Chaitanya.

307
00:34:40,772 --> 00:34:49,052
He doesn’t say… think that, “Now supposing
I give Chaitanya, give life to this person,

308
00:34:49,052 --> 00:34:52,462
my ego will come up,” – very common problem.

309
00:34:52,462 --> 00:34:59,552
“Mother I don’t want to do it because
my ego will come up.”

310
00:34:59,552 --> 00:35:03,621
Everybody is psychoanalyzing themselves ‘because
this will happen’ – Baba!

311
00:35:03,621 --> 00:35:05,502
[- Hindi expression of a general exclamatory
nature –ed.]

312
00:35:05,502 --> 00:35:10,212
You are all realized souls now, you are all
saints.

313
00:35:10,212 --> 00:35:16,412
The false people are talking so big, and you
the people who have got something are still

314
00:35:16,412 --> 00:35:19,752
thinking, “My ego will come up, this will
happen.”

315
00:35:19,752 --> 00:35:25,632
No, no, you have the powers.

316
00:35:25,632 --> 00:35:36,452
But as you keep it under a manger, as Christ
has said, the light will go out.

317
00:35:36,452 --> 00:35:48,371
You have to give it to others, you have to
open it out.

318
00:35:48,371 --> 00:35:50,452
And that is how you will judge your state.

319
00:35:50,452 --> 00:35:53,102
“What is my state?

320
00:35:53,102 --> 00:35:55,172
Let’s see.

321
00:35:55,172 --> 00:35:58,262
Where am I?”

322
00:35:58,262 --> 00:36:05,752
That confidence, take it from Me, should be
with you.

323
00:36:05,752 --> 00:36:11,292
All of you have to work out this way.

324
00:36:11,292 --> 00:36:13,272
Very many…

325
00:36:13,272 --> 00:36:15,542
“Mother, my Mooladhara is caught up.”

326
00:36:15,542 --> 00:36:19,422
How dare anybody catch Mooladhar?

327
00:36:19,422 --> 00:36:23,472
That’s the anger of Shri Ganesha.

328
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:26,762
How dare?

329
00:36:26,762 --> 00:36:30,371
How can anybody?

330
00:36:30,371 --> 00:36:39,172
What’s missing is complete faith in yourself
and faith in your Mother.

331
00:36:39,172 --> 00:36:47,152
In Russia recently… in Prague, there was
a lady who was brought on the stage, very

332
00:36:47,152 --> 00:36:48,352
old lady, couldn’t walk.

333
00:36:48,352 --> 00:36:54,621
I mean they just carried her and she came
and sat before Me on a chair.

334
00:36:54,621 --> 00:36:56,882
She said, “I know You…

335
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:58,232
I’ll be cured.

336
00:36:58,232 --> 00:37:02,142
I am in Your presence; I know I will be cured.”

337
00:37:02,142 --> 00:37:03,262
I said, “Then get up.”

338
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:04,492
She got up.

339
00:37:04,492 --> 00:37:09,032
Those who were with Me in Prague, you can
ask them.

340
00:37:09,032 --> 00:37:15,371
She came down and she started running, and
everybody laughed.

341
00:37:15,371 --> 00:37:28,052
But her faith – she was not a Sahaja Yogini
as such – but she was sure; she knew Me.

342
00:37:28,052 --> 00:37:32,162
And she just started running like that and
everybody started looking at her.

343
00:37:32,162 --> 00:37:40,862
Same thing happened in Russia for many people
– very serious diseases.

344
00:37:40,862 --> 00:37:49,861
So that, one thing is for sure, either you
don’t know that you are realized souls or

345
00:37:49,861 --> 00:37:54,132
else you don’t know Me, one of the two things.

346
00:37:54,132 --> 00:37:57,142
Why was He so obedient to His Mother?

347
00:37:57,142 --> 00:37:58,812
Why was He?

348
00:37:58,812 --> 00:38:00,592
Because that was the wisest thing to do.

349
00:38:00,592 --> 00:38:12,812
The one who knows everything, it’s better
to be guided by that person.

350
00:38:12,812 --> 00:38:17,192
And many a times I have seen, people try to
do things without telling Me, important things

351
00:38:17,192 --> 00:38:20,061
– they fall into traps.

352
00:38:20,061 --> 00:38:27,302
Then they come back to Me and I tell them
the solution, it works.

353
00:38:27,302 --> 00:38:32,862
It’s not necessary that you should tell
Me everything.

354
00:38:32,862 --> 00:38:43,942
But when you are in a fix, you can always
just go into yourself and ask yourself, “What

355
00:38:43,942 --> 00:38:44,972
would Mother do?”

356
00:38:44,972 --> 00:38:47,912
You’ll get the answer.

357
00:38:47,912 --> 00:38:50,262
You are at a… quite a higher state.

358
00:38:50,262 --> 00:38:55,682
But still, even if you are on a tree and you
are still thinking you are falling down, you

359
00:38:55,682 --> 00:38:57,932
are nowhere.

360
00:38:57,932 --> 00:39:00,182
Steady yourself.

361
00:39:00,182 --> 00:39:10,022
That’s what is, we say, the Adhishthan of
Shri Ganesha.

362
00:39:10,022 --> 00:39:18,732
Is the steadiness, steadiness in your achievements
of Sahaj Yog.

363
00:39:18,732 --> 00:39:26,572
Believing in yourself that you have entered
into the new world, into the new atmosphere

364
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:30,382
[UNCLEAR] it out.

365
00:39:30,382 --> 00:39:37,562
Shri Ganesha is just waiting.

366
00:39:37,562 --> 00:39:41,452
But He is not meant for people who have no
courage.

367
00:39:41,452 --> 00:39:58,435
Such a courageous man who could go and fight
with all the Devas, because He knew the Shakti

368
00:39:58,435 --> 00:40:05,042
was with Him.

369
00:40:05,042 --> 00:40:14,402
Today is such a joyous day for Me because
we have children, and we are dealing with

370
00:40:14,402 --> 00:40:15,402
children.

371
00:40:15,402 --> 00:40:17,402
Most of them are born realized.

372
00:40:17,402 --> 00:40:28,402
They are of a very special category, I have
told you many a times, but we spoil them;

373
00:40:28,402 --> 00:40:36,512
because we were not born realized, so we don’t
know how to handle these children, we spoil

374
00:40:36,512 --> 00:40:37,512
them.

375
00:40:37,512 --> 00:40:43,042
Not only we spoil them, but we interfere with
the school, we interfere with this as if we

376
00:40:43,042 --> 00:40:53,162
are the wisest parents ever living.

377
00:40:53,162 --> 00:40:59,672
Because we are Sahaja Yogis, we have to be
much more sensible than other parents.

378
00:40:59,672 --> 00:41:03,182
How can you interfere with any school anywhere?

379
00:41:03,182 --> 00:41:11,202
But in Sahaja Yoga you will.

380
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:21,432
It is because there is no wisdom and no understanding
what is good and benevolent for your child.

381
00:41:21,432 --> 00:41:26,402
If you love your child, then you must think
of its benevolent.

382
00:41:26,402 --> 00:41:33,292
You must learn from the experience what happens
to children if they are left like that.

383
00:41:33,292 --> 00:41:40,442
You cannot spoil your child, you cannot because
it’s a special category of children they

384
00:41:40,442 --> 00:41:41,442
are.

385
00:41:41,442 --> 00:41:52,782
They are not children who can become vagabonds;
they cannot become thieves.

386
00:41:52,782 --> 00:42:00,472
So you will make them something funny – they
are neither here nor there.

387
00:42:00,472 --> 00:42:09,072
They are born realized and they have to be
channelized properly, to achieve their complete

388
00:42:09,072 --> 00:42:16,902
manifestation of their Spirit.

389
00:42:16,902 --> 00:42:27,081
So the possessiveness and the stupid attachments
to children must be given up.

390
00:42:27,081 --> 00:42:32,912
There is no force on you – if you want to
destroy a child, you can destroy.

391
00:42:32,912 --> 00:42:39,562
But in an advice – if you were Ganeshas,
you would have understood it, I don’t have

392
00:42:39,562 --> 00:42:43,752
to explain so much.

393
00:42:43,752 --> 00:42:51,412
What is good for your child, because we have
to have beautiful children.

394
00:42:51,412 --> 00:42:53,702
They are born beautiful children, I tell you.

395
00:42:53,702 --> 00:42:58,432
If they are spoilt, it is because of you,
you have spoilt them.

396
00:42:58,432 --> 00:43:00,852
You have ruined them.

397
00:43:00,852 --> 00:43:03,412
You are responsible.

398
00:43:03,412 --> 00:43:11,312
I know of so many children – they’re very,
very sweet.

399
00:43:11,312 --> 00:43:19,012
I have conference with them also and I find
them much more congenial; I have much better

400
00:43:19,012 --> 00:43:24,172
rapport with them than I can have with you.

401
00:43:24,172 --> 00:43:27,252
They never argue, never.

402
00:43:27,252 --> 00:43:38,101
They never says no, and they have very good
information about all of you.

403
00:43:38,101 --> 00:43:45,042
So it is such a nice thing that today you
should desire that our children should very

404
00:43:45,042 --> 00:43:55,892
soon become the images of Shri Ganesha, His
Ganas, who have to work out so much.

405
00:43:55,892 --> 00:43:59,172
It’s a tremendous task.

406
00:43:59,172 --> 00:44:07,152
Sahaja Yoga is the greatest achievement of
Spiritual evolution.

407
00:44:07,152 --> 00:44:11,752
We all have to dedicate ourselves.

408
00:44:11,752 --> 00:44:17,722
We don’t have to sacrifice anything as the
Saints have sacrificed – nothing, don’t

409
00:44:17,722 --> 00:44:19,302
have to suffer anything.

410
00:44:19,302 --> 00:44:22,202
Only thing you have to have – wisdom.

411
00:44:22,202 --> 00:44:28,621
For that, I am very happy that today we are
worshipping Shri Ganesha.

412
00:44:28,621 --> 00:44:37,322
So the pure desire should be that, “Shri
Ganesha please give us Divine Wisdom.”

413
00:44:37,322 --> 00:44:39,302
That’s all.

414
00:44:39,302 --> 00:44:40,772
It contains everything in it.

415
00:44:40,772 --> 00:44:41,772
May God bless you.
