WEBVTT

01:31:25.146 --> 01:31:30.996
You must put some heated butter
in the nose, all of you.

01:31:30.996 --> 01:31:32.526
Sahaja Yogi: Inside?

01:31:32.526 --> 01:31:35.806
Shri Mataji: Inside, with a dropper, alright?

01:31:35.806 --> 01:31:37.736
Heat butter and fill it up.

01:31:37.736 --> 01:31:43.146
And then, when it is slightly warm, not very
warm, absolutely slightly warm, then put it

01:31:43.146 --> 01:31:48.246
in your nose, very important, because the-
I don’t know in this country, people, it’s

01:31:48.246 --> 01:31:54.256
a very simple thing to be done once in a while,
about say two or three days later or even

01:31:54.256 --> 01:31:56.106
every day you do, doesn’t matter.

01:31:56.106 --> 01:32:02.736
It’s like putting cream on your hands, you
see, because the cold weather also chaps inside

01:32:02.736 --> 01:32:04.566
the lining of the nose.

01:32:04.566 --> 01:32:12.886
And when you put this, it makes the nose smooth
and you don’t get troubles of it.

01:32:12.886 --> 01:32:14.006
It’s very simple.

01:32:14.006 --> 01:32:17.865
All of you should do, all the Sahaja Yogis
are supposed to do.

01:32:17.865 --> 01:32:21.986
There are so many things that a Sahaja Yogis
are supposed to do, one of them is this, that

01:32:21.986 --> 01:32:25.116
try to keep you Hamsa Chakra alright.

01:32:25.116 --> 01:32:28.976
By keeping your nose alright you are keeping
your Hamsa Chakra better.

01:32:28.976 --> 01:32:35.176
So better use this simple method of heating
some ghee, we call it.

01:32:35.176 --> 01:32:41.706
You see, you can prepare it, heat the butter,
keep it in a bottle with a dropper, and heat

01:32:41.706 --> 01:32:49.886
it in the hot water and then put it in the
nose, just like that, in the night, before

01:32:49.886 --> 01:32:50.886
sleeping.

01:32:50.886 --> 01:32:52.246
Even in the ears, we must put olive oil.

01:32:52.246 --> 01:32:55.966
It’s very important.

01:32:55.966 --> 01:33:00.896
For the teeth also, you must take some salt,
put some olive oil and rub your gums.

01:33:00.896 --> 01:33:04.155
With that, you won’t have to go to the dentist
anymore.

01:33:04.155 --> 01:33:07.360
That’s the best, I’ve never been to a
dentist all my life, and I don’t want you

01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:09.886
to go to the dentist anymore.

01:33:09.886 --> 01:33:17.186
So that’s a very good way of rubbing your
gums with vibrated salt and what you call

01:33:17.186 --> 01:33:18.386
the olive oil.

01:33:18.386 --> 01:33:25.676
Also you must oil your heads, every Saturday,
with so much of oil, nicely, oil it, massage

01:33:25.676 --> 01:33:29.016
your head and sleep off and next day, wash
up your hair.

01:33:29.016 --> 01:33:30.796
You’ll feel very much better.

01:33:30.796 --> 01:33:34.526
If any of you cannot give olive oil the best
is almond oil for the head.

01:33:34.526 --> 01:33:36.176
You’ll keep very peaceful.

01:33:36.176 --> 01:33:40.346
Specially your children, you must massage
them till they’re five years of age, every

01:33:40.346 --> 01:33:46.566
night, when they go out to sleep in the night,
nicely very- before sleeping.

01:33:46.566 --> 01:33:50.096
And then put some powder, clean it out, let
them sleep.

01:33:50.096 --> 01:33:53.116
Then the children won’t be running and upset
and all that.

01:33:53.116 --> 01:33:55.926
They’ll become very quiet children, well-behaved
children.

01:33:55.926 --> 01:33:59.536
Because you people don’t massage the children,
all their lives they are jumping.

01:33:59.536 --> 01:34:04.756
And all their lives they are slightly violent,
you see, the nose must be smooth out.

01:34:04.756 --> 01:34:09.495
It’s a very simple method and as you are
Realised people you’ll smooth them much

01:34:09.495 --> 01:34:10.495
more.

01:34:10.495 --> 01:34:12.899
All these small, small things must be taken
care of, you see.

01:34:12.899 --> 01:34:19.096
Now if you have too much of cold, if you have
too much of cold, then you can mix up with

01:34:19.096 --> 01:34:27.385
a bit of camphor, with oil, and put that in
the nose, little actually, not much, that

01:34:27.385 --> 01:34:31.606
also is very good, that also smooth your cold
and puts you right.

01:34:31.606 --> 01:34:35.956
This country has one big problem with Vishuddhi
chakra everywhere in the West, because of

01:34:35.956 --> 01:34:36.956
the cold.

01:34:36.956 --> 01:34:41.275
And in Sahaja Yoga it is compulsory that you
must wear an undershirt.

01:34:41.275 --> 01:34:43.996
It is compulsory.

01:34:43.996 --> 01:34:49.806
Whatever may be, it is hot, cold, in India
when it’s steaming hot, you must wear an

01:34:49.806 --> 01:34:56.256
undershirt, because, when it is very hot you
start perspiring and that perspiration causes

01:34:56.256 --> 01:34:57.256
problems.

01:34:57.256 --> 01:35:03.506
So, always wear an undershirt, whether you
are in a hot season or in a cold season.

01:35:03.506 --> 01:35:06.805
That’s a compulsion for Sahaja Yogis that
they must wear.

01:35:06.805 --> 01:35:13.546
And for all of them, also is compulsory that
they should always wear a muffler when they

01:35:13.546 --> 01:35:17.355
go out in the winter time this is an important
thing.

01:35:17.355 --> 01:35:23.445
And also put some cotton wool in the ears
as I put it.

01:35:23.445 --> 01:35:27.855
For your sake I’ve told you to put it cause
you are careless, so I look after you but

01:35:27.855 --> 01:35:29.946
putting it to my ears like this.

01:35:29.946 --> 01:35:32.266
You all should put it before going out.

01:35:32.266 --> 01:35:38.335
And keep your head covered in the night, when
you sleep, cover your head with something

01:35:38.335 --> 01:35:39.335
and then sleep.

01:35:39.335 --> 01:35:42.976
Because most of the time, your body is all
covered, but the head is not covered.

01:35:42.976 --> 01:35:47.786
Because now you are Realised-souls and your
Sahastrara is weak, so you must look after

01:35:47.786 --> 01:35:48.786
your Sahastrara.

01:35:48.786 --> 01:35:53.036
Cover your head so that you won’t have any
problem.

01:35:53.036 --> 01:35:56.346
Also you must verify what sort of a person
you are.

01:35:56.346 --> 01:36:01.606
If you have a liver problem, you must get
a diet for that, which is here, people will

01:36:01.606 --> 01:36:02.606
tell you.

01:36:02.606 --> 01:36:07.076
If you are left sided person, if you have
left sided problems, then you must know about

01:36:07.076 --> 01:36:08.076
the diet that you have to take.

01:36:08.076 --> 01:36:13.726
For example, a person who is a left sided
should not take carbohydrates at all, on the

01:36:13.726 --> 01:36:15.866
contrary should eat proteins, in whatever
form it is possible.

01:36:15.866 --> 01:36:20.786
In Sahaja Yoga you know we don’t believe
in vegetarianism or anything, but we do believe

01:36:20.786 --> 01:36:28.896
that the muscles of bigger animals than us,
are not good for our teeth, or for our body

01:36:28.896 --> 01:36:36.036
also because the structure of a muscular cell
of a bigger animal is much bigger than ours.

01:36:36.036 --> 01:36:40.926
And that’s how they heat up, I mean, even
by mistake if I eat some beef, or anybody

01:36:40.926 --> 01:36:47.236
ask me, the other day, my cheeks were swollen
up, so that’s why it happens, it is an automatic

01:36:47.236 --> 01:36:48.236
reaction.

01:36:48.236 --> 01:36:56.636
And we are not supposed to use plastics; in
our clothes, also try to avoid.

01:36:56.636 --> 01:37:01.906
Some person, [?] plastic can be used but not
all the time plastics and nylons.

01:37:01.906 --> 01:37:04.186
And also the food should not be eaten in plastics.

01:37:04.186 --> 01:37:10.956
You can eat it in paper, paper is alright
because it is –what you call- is wood, it

01:37:10.956 --> 01:37:12.026
doesn’t matter.

01:37:12.026 --> 01:37:18.586
But you shouldn’t eat in plastic food, plactic
with fork and spoon of plastic and it’s

01:37:18.586 --> 01:37:23.346
too much plastic in this country, be careful
because plastic is anti-God.

01:37:23.346 --> 01:37:28.436
It is anti-human life, it is anti-biological
processes.

01:37:28.436 --> 01:37:32.976
So avoid plastic as far as possible, be careful
on that.

01:37:32.976 --> 01:37:38.136
Also don’t use, I mean, something out of
absolute plastic like, I’ve seen I wanted

01:37:38.136 --> 01:37:44.176
to buy one pair of slippers for myself, I
couldn’t get one in the all of New-York.

01:37:44.176 --> 01:37:46.556
Because I didn’t want a plastic.

01:37:46.556 --> 01:37:50.816
And if you wear that then you develop all
kinds of skin problems and diseases, so be

01:37:50.816 --> 01:37:52.286
careful on that.

01:37:52.286 --> 01:37:55.436
There are so many other things we have to
be careful about.

01:37:55.436 --> 01:38:00.106
And because we have found out that these things
are harmful, that’s why we have made it

01:38:00.106 --> 01:38:02.836
compulsory that every one of you must be careful.

01:38:02.836 --> 01:38:09.166
Because now you have become the temple of
God and the temple of God should be healthy.

01:38:09.166 --> 01:38:16.066
We don’t want tubercular patients to go
around as saints nobody is going to believe

01:38:16.066 --> 01:38:17.066
them.

01:38:17.066 --> 01:38:20.376
Sahaja Yogi: Can you just tell us about sugar.

01:38:20.376 --> 01:38:21.666
Shri Mataji: Ah.

01:38:21.666 --> 01:38:27.756
Now there is another falsehood about- thank’s
God it’s now broken- that the sugar is against

01:38:27.756 --> 01:38:29.656
our growth and all that.

01:38:29.656 --> 01:38:35.036
Sugar is very important for attention, specially
people who suffer from liver.

01:38:35.036 --> 01:38:38.436
For example, people who are thin, mostly,
suffer from liver trouble.

01:38:38.436 --> 01:38:44.276
For them, sugar is so important, that if they
don’t take sugar, they’ll become like

01:38:44.276 --> 01:38:49.926
the sugar cane which is, comes out of the
machine, pressing machine, you see.

01:38:49.926 --> 01:38:52.106
They’d better take some sugar.

01:38:52.106 --> 01:38:56.246
Sugar is very important for your liver!

01:38:56.246 --> 01:39:00.216
Best carbohydrate is the white sugar, not
the red sugar; red sugar is not good because

01:39:00.216 --> 01:39:02.806
it has got molasses, it’s very heating.

01:39:02.806 --> 01:39:07.006
Some people have funny ideas here, also about
food.

01:39:07.006 --> 01:39:12.306
Like, some of them believe, that if you eat
natural food- and once I got something from

01:39:12.306 --> 01:39:15.256
natural store and I got diarrhoea for five
days!

01:39:15.256 --> 01:39:20.446
Because it was meant for animals not for human
beings.

01:39:20.446 --> 01:39:26.336
Like some people eat, what you call them [Shri
Mataji speaks in Marathi] cotton seed.

01:39:26.336 --> 01:39:29.106
Now cotton seeds we give only to animals.

01:39:29.106 --> 01:39:31.106
I can’t believe it.

01:39:31.106 --> 01:39:34.656
But I’ve seen in Switzerland, they give
cotton seed in the bread.

01:39:34.656 --> 01:39:39.316
There was cotton seeds in the bread, one or
two is alright, but imagine [Shri Mataji speaks

01:39:39.316 --> 01:39:42.096
in Hindi] – Laughs from Hindi speakers.

01:39:42.096 --> 01:39:44.336
I mean it has to be given to buffalos only!

01:39:44.336 --> 01:39:46.456
[Laughter] Like that, I was given a [inaudible]
You see, these are very strong things.

01:39:46.456 --> 01:39:51.436
In the same way, very soft food is also not
good, we have to be in the centre in everything.

01:39:51.436 --> 01:39:56.915
Don’t eat very raw food you see, like some
of the bread in France you know, even in England

01:39:56.915 --> 01:40:00.716
we find, the bread cereals [inaudible] completely.

01:40:00.716 --> 01:40:03.056
So that kind of a crispy stuff is not needed.

01:40:03.056 --> 01:40:10.156
It should be such that your gums are looked
after, there are delicate things, and have

01:40:10.156 --> 01:40:13.136
food which is good for you.

01:40:13.136 --> 01:40:18.156
Don’t go with rationality, don’t go with
the fashion, but whatever is good for you

01:40:18.156 --> 01:40:19.156
that should be done.

01:40:19.156 --> 01:40:23.926
And you find out about yourself, what is your
temperament, what sort of a food will suit

01:40:23.926 --> 01:40:27.096
you, and accordingly you should eat.

01:40:27.096 --> 01:40:32.276
Of course, everybody is free to do what they
like but we can only advise them that this

01:40:32.276 --> 01:40:37.296
will suit you and you’ll find out it will
be very useful to all of you, it will help

01:40:37.296 --> 01:40:38.296
you.

01:40:38.296 --> 01:40:42.286
For your hair growth, also you should get
vibrated oil and use it.

01:40:42.286 --> 01:40:46.096
Now, you’ll be surprised that day, somebody
saw Warren and he said: “He is the same

01:40:46.096 --> 01:40:47.096
fellow?

01:40:47.096 --> 01:40:48.096
He looks much younger”.

01:40:48.096 --> 01:40:49.236
So I said: “Yes”.

01:40:49.236 --> 01:40:53.416
he had a bald head from here to here like
that and now he’s grown hair.

01:40:53.416 --> 01:41:00.146
With proper care, you can have you hair quite
intact, for quite some time, if you look after

01:41:00.146 --> 01:41:01.146
your hair.

01:41:01.146 --> 01:41:06.046
But hair is very important is not so much
the look, but it’s Sahastrara.

01:41:06.046 --> 01:41:13.286
And if you put oil in your Sahastrara every
week, you will have a smooth personality,

01:41:13.286 --> 01:41:21.506
a smooth behaviour, a smooth movement; you’ll
deal with other people in a gentle manner.

01:41:21.506 --> 01:41:22.546
So this is very necessary.

01:41:22.546 --> 01:41:27.576
In India we actually have a big masseur attached
to a family, you see, he’s a very hefty

01:41:27.576 --> 01:41:32.646
fellow, and he comes to masseur [massage]
the men, you see, and he just sits on their

01:41:32.646 --> 01:41:35.736
body and really finishes them off completely!

01:41:35.736 --> 01:41:39.196
At the first shot, they’re dead!

01:41:39.196 --> 01:41:45.016
Then he uses their body fully and pushes them
and sits on them rub them with one clap!

01:41:45.016 --> 01:41:48.716
You see, five, six of them will be jumping
on five, six people.

01:41:48.716 --> 01:41:50.516
With clap, they’ll go round.

01:41:50.516 --> 01:41:53.356
By the time the second clap comes in, the
person is finished!

01:41:53.356 --> 01:41:55.366
That’s how, that’s how they manage.

01:41:55.366 --> 01:41:59.036
But there is no importance on massage in here,
you see.

01:41:59.036 --> 01:42:02.366
And don’t ask a non Sahaja Yogi to massage
you, never.

01:42:02.366 --> 01:42:08.996
Don’t allow anybody to touch you that way
because, you see, these people carry all bad

01:42:08.996 --> 01:42:10.826
vibrations and you may suffer.

01:42:10.826 --> 01:42:16.816
You must allow only the Realised souls to
massage you, if possible, or you yourself

01:42:16.816 --> 01:42:18.006
should massage yourself.

01:42:18.006 --> 01:42:23.606
But don’t go to these masseurs and people
who are massaging all kind of people and they

01:42:23.606 --> 01:42:26.056
might be giving you some troubles.

01:42:26.056 --> 01:42:31.126
So one has to be very careful about certain
things and certain personal habits also which

01:42:31.126 --> 01:42:32.126
we have discussed.

01:42:32.126 --> 01:42:37.636
And you can ask Warren, he’ll tell you about
it, which are very important for Mooladhara

01:42:37.636 --> 01:42:41.726
and all those things, which must be followed,
whether you are in England, America, anywhere.

01:42:41.726 --> 01:42:46.526
These must be followed to keep yourself clean
outside and inside.

01:42:46.526 --> 01:42:47.886
Now if you have any question.

01:42:47.886 --> 01:42:53.126
Sahaja Yogi: I was only wondering about the
kind of techniques that we should use when

01:42:53.126 --> 01:42:55.296
massaging the children.

01:42:55.296 --> 01:42:56.896
But I guess we can talk about that another
time.

01:42:56.896 --> 01:43:02.026
Shri Mataji: I mean, anyway you use is alright,
but always, you put it upwards, you see?

01:43:02.026 --> 01:43:07.486
The movement should be upwards, but use oil
otherwise you pull up, you pull up their hair.

01:43:07.486 --> 01:43:10.916
So use oil to put it upwards.

01:43:10.916 --> 01:43:14.266
Sahaja Yogi: And don’t forget the Sahasrara.

01:43:14.266 --> 01:43:16.656
Shri Mataji: Sahasrara, don’t forget.

01:43:16.656 --> 01:43:21.466
Sahasrara you must put lot of oil on children.

01:43:21.466 --> 01:43:29.426
Sahaja Yogi: Mother we’re gone need more
hairdressers, people who can cut hair, who

01:43:29.426 --> 01:43:30.426
are Realised souls, cause they are touching
our Sahastrara while cutting.

01:43:30.426 --> 01:43:31.426
Shri Mataji: Yes.

01:43:31.426 --> 01:43:32.426
Otherwise you can grow, what’s the harm?

01:43:32.426 --> 01:43:33.426
Sahaja Yogi: We can grow our hair Mother?

01:43:33.426 --> 01:43:35.226
Shri Mataji: Yes here, up to here [below the
ears] you can grow and turn them round.

01:43:35.226 --> 01:43:42.646
Shri Mataji: You see, you’ll look like a
philosopher, quite impressive.

01:43:42.646 --> 01:43:48.796
Shri Mataji: But you should not be a funny
looking person.

01:43:48.796 --> 01:43:52.926
That’s one thing very important you see.

01:43:52.926 --> 01:43:57.306
You have to, not to adopt some funny methods,
you see?

01:43:57.306 --> 01:43:58.546
Like people have.

01:43:58.546 --> 01:44:03.596
Specially, nowadays, the fashion is to disable
your hair and keep them absolutely disabled,

01:44:03.596 --> 01:44:08.226
there’s no need of doing-
Sahaja Yogi: The hair must be up there, over

01:44:08.226 --> 01:44:09.226
the forehead.

01:44:09.226 --> 01:44:10.226
Shri Mataji: Ah!

01:44:10.226 --> 01:44:14.146
It should be keep back over the forehead,
don’t cover your forehead or your eyes,

01:44:14.146 --> 01:44:15.146
never.

01:44:15.146 --> 01:44:16.836
Sahaja Yogis: Agnya chakra
Shri Mataji: Ah.

01:44:16.836 --> 01:44:17.836
Agnya chakra.

01:44:17.836 --> 01:44:20.546
You must keep it open, you see, always open.

01:44:20.546 --> 01:44:26.346
You must have a centre path if it’s possible,
but keep the forehead open, this is important.

01:44:26.346 --> 01:44:30.576
You should keep the forehead open, it’s
very good for others you see, and don’t

01:44:30.576 --> 01:44:32.785
cover your eyes with any hair.

01:44:32.785 --> 01:44:37.966
Many people have a habit of allowing the hair
to come in the eyes and you’ll have [inaudible].

01:44:37.966 --> 01:44:42.686
Children also, never allow hair to come on
their eyes.

01:44:42.686 --> 01:44:46.906
Then we have something for the eyes also,
what you call Netranjan, I don’t have now

01:44:46.906 --> 01:44:51.776
anything, but it’s a very good, simple thing,
cots you nothing about- [Shri Mataji speaks

01:44:51.776 --> 01:44:53.526
aside] one cent of a dollar.

01:44:53.526 --> 01:44:56.426
Sahaja Yogi: We have some, we can send them
tomorrow.

01:44:56.426 --> 01:45:01.076
Shri Mataji: Alright, they have some, they’ll
give you, which is to be applied first very

01:45:01.076 --> 01:45:02.076
carefully.

01:45:02.076 --> 01:45:07.166
Because if you are not used to it, it will
a little bit burn and the tears will start

01:45:07.166 --> 01:45:09.416
coming out of your eyes, it will clear your
eyes.

01:45:09.416 --> 01:45:13.035
And you’ll be surprised, with that, if you
use it, you don’t develop these bags [dark

01:45:13.035 --> 01:45:14.156
circles] and things like that.

01:45:14.156 --> 01:45:15.246
And the water flows out.

01:45:15.246 --> 01:45:17.356
It’s a very simple thing.

01:45:17.356 --> 01:45:26.006
And for soap also, try to use natural soaps,
better use, because here the soaps are such

01:45:26.006 --> 01:45:27.976
that I don’t know what to say.

01:45:27.976 --> 01:45:29.096
Sahaja Yogi: Paramolove Mother?

01:45:29.096 --> 01:45:32.736
Paramolove, I think that is about the only
soap you can get here.

01:45:32.736 --> 01:45:46.267
Shri Mataji: Yes that is good, Paramolove
is good.

01:45:46.267 --> 01:45:47.267
It’s very good.

01:45:47.267 --> 01:45:48.267
Gap in the video

01:45:48.267 --> 01:45:52.356
Shri Mataji: What to do, is to take a little
oil, and heat with some clove, Cloves.

01:45:52.356 --> 01:45:54.186
Sahaja Yogi: Cloves?

01:45:54.186 --> 01:45:56.016
Shri Mataji: Cloves.

01:45:56.016 --> 01:46:05.586
And let the oil be a little bit cool down,
when it is quite cooled down, nor burning

01:46:05.586 --> 01:46:09.726
out at all, but just warm, you can feel it,
then put it in the ears.

01:46:09.726 --> 01:46:11.266
Sahaja Yogini: Olive oil is better?

01:46:11.266 --> 01:46:12.806
Shri Mataji: Olive oil is alright.

01:46:12.806 --> 01:46:13.806
Gap in the video

01:46:13.806 --> 01:46:19.156
Sahaja Yogi: Mother can you explain to us
the techniques of vibrated sugar and vibrated

01:46:19.156 --> 01:46:24.196
salt, by giving vibrations, I don’t quite
understand you see…

01:46:24.196 --> 01:46:30.146
Shri Mataji: You see, because God has given
you vibrations, the power is flowing through

01:46:30.146 --> 01:46:32.406
you now, the vibrations are there.

01:46:32.406 --> 01:46:37.696
So whatever you get from outside is touched
by so many people, so many people have created

01:46:37.696 --> 01:46:41.546
it and they have got a good mind or may be
something’s wrong with them, best thing

01:46:41.546 --> 01:46:43.986
is to give them a bandhan before eating.

01:46:43.986 --> 01:46:47.126
[Shri Mataji turns tree times her hand]
Any food you eat you must give it a bandhan

01:46:47.126 --> 01:46:52.106
like this three times, so your vibrations
flow into the food and you get it sanctified.

01:46:52.106 --> 01:46:58.056
Or else, you can also use your hands for eating
if you have washed your hands, then it’s

01:46:58.056 --> 01:46:59.056
alright.

01:46:59.056 --> 01:47:04.226
Or else, if you are taking the water, you
can just put your hands there, then it gets

01:47:04.226 --> 01:47:05.556
vibrated, then drink it.

01:47:05.556 --> 01:47:09.586
Because, the thing is, the vibrations have
started flowing through your hands, but still

01:47:09.686 --> 01:47:13.046
have not spread to your body fully.

01:47:13.106 --> 01:47:15.686
You see my point?
