00:00:37.307 --> 00:00:46.046
Today we have gathered here to do
the Sahastrara puja.

00:00:47.038 --> 00:00:54.218
Sahastrar, the word ‘sahastr’, in Sanskrit
language, means ‘one thousand’.

00:00:54.419 --> 00:01:04.880
And there are one thousand petals
in our brain, which get enlightened.

00:01:05.081 --> 00:01:11.525
Of course, the doctors are quarrelling
on that point, but forget about them.

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:19.698
Now these petals are kept ready
for our enlightenment,

00:01:20.604 --> 00:01:28.659
and these are really the nerves,
one thousand nerves,

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.270
which are there for the enlightenment
of the brain.

00:01:34.778 --> 00:01:45.987
So when the Kundalini rises, she enlightens
those one thousand nerves

00:01:46.188 --> 00:01:55.280
which become like a –

00:01:55.481 --> 00:02:07.781
as you see here, the shape of these
flames – like a petal.

00:02:08.606 --> 00:02:18.276
And that’s why it is called as ‘Sahastrara’
- is the centre of Sahastrara.

00:02:18.477 --> 00:02:26.265
In the human beings it is a very important
centre,

00:02:26.466 --> 00:02:33.760
because this is the only centre by which
we think

00:02:33.961 --> 00:02:41.859
and we try to stop whatever we don’t like.

00:02:42.653 --> 00:02:50.323
This is the centre which reacts, reacts
in such a manner

00:02:50.524 --> 00:02:58.362
that, without any discretion we start
saying, ‘no’ to this, and, ‘no’ to that,

00:02:58.563 --> 00:03:03.844
on small things also. Like somebody might
say, “I don’t like this carpet,”

00:03:04.045 --> 00:03:08.841
“I don’t like this house,” “I don’t
like that.”

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:18.133
This language itself shows that – who
are you? First find out!

00:03:18.334 --> 00:03:23.048
But you cannot become yourself unless
and until this Sahastrara,

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:32.127
this brain is opened out and the Kundalini
becomes one with the Paramchaitanya.

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:43.296
Before that, you are in complete ignorance
about what is good and what is bad.

00:03:43.497 --> 00:03:49.564
Whatever you think [that], for this brain,
is good, you do it.

00:03:49.765 --> 00:03:54.422
But whatever is really good, you do
not know,

00:03:54.623 --> 00:03:58.805
because you do not know the Reality.

00:03:59.837 --> 00:04:04.520
Now we have to understand the consciousness
that we have:

00:04:04.721 --> 00:04:11.314
consciousness of being alive, consciousness
of so many things we have,

00:04:11.515 --> 00:04:16.968
and the so-called knowledge we have
about everything.

00:04:17.547 --> 00:04:24.389
All that consciousness is stored near
the liver – for your information –

00:04:24.635 --> 00:04:27.566
by this diaphragm.

00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:33.293
But then, this consciousness starts rising,
higher and higher.

00:04:33.494 --> 00:04:38.026
Then you become aware. In the evolutionary
process,

00:04:38.227 --> 00:04:43.280
you become aware, aware of things.

00:04:43.481 --> 00:04:50.819
Without going through your brain, you just
become aware. And how?

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.814
Not by thinking, not by understanding
or seeing,

00:04:57.015 --> 00:05:03.112
but you become aware because
your brain has now

00:05:03.313 --> 00:05:10.546
started working in a manner that’s very,
very sensitive.

00:05:10.747 --> 00:05:16.557
So you just become aware of some sort
of a fear,

00:05:16.758 --> 00:05:23.402
or maybe some sort of a goodness
or anything. But it goes even further.

00:05:23.603 --> 00:05:28.784
The growth of consciousness, which becomes
aware, goes further:

00:05:28.985 --> 00:05:38.997
where you start liking a person,
or disliking a person.

00:05:40.768 --> 00:05:46.036
But, still it’s nothing definite and sure.

00:05:46.237 --> 00:05:50.672
You dislike a person because he has
a particular type of a face,

00:05:50.873 --> 00:05:54.631
maybe eyes or maybe anything.

00:05:55.604 --> 00:06:02.660
Or maybe because you have known
somebody who has been very nice,

00:06:02.861 --> 00:06:08.988
so you start transferring that image
onto others.

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:17.235
With these transferred images, you can
hate or love someone.

00:06:17.436 --> 00:06:23.138
Then you start saying, “I hate this,
I hate that,”

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:28.388
which has no, actually, substantial
meaning.

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:37.116
You hate it because, perhaps, maybe such
and such person looks like somebody.

00:06:37.473 --> 00:06:41.535
Now you go further with it, then you see
that, such and such person –

00:06:41.736 --> 00:06:45.383
now I’m not talking about things, but
about persons -

00:06:45.584 --> 00:06:53.196
such and such person has done this harm to me
- something positive (may mean "negative").

00:06:53.397 --> 00:06:59.545
So you start feeling that you should hate
that person.

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:03.896
Now you start hating that person.
With that hatred

00:07:04.097 --> 00:07:08.511
you develop new faculties [of] how to harm
that person.

00:07:08.712 --> 00:07:12.958
Then you start thinking how to destroy
that person,

00:07:13.159 --> 00:07:18.538
how to make his life miserable.

00:07:18.739 --> 00:07:24.469
Then you may beat that person, you may
shout at that person,

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:28.747
you may try to kill that person. You can
do anything.

00:07:28.948 --> 00:07:34.321
So now the awareness is going towards
another direction, which is darkness,

00:07:34.522 --> 00:07:40.157
which is not light, because in the light
you won’t do such a thing.

00:07:40.358 --> 00:07:46.235
In the light you see everybody, everybody
is sitting, you know how far you are,

00:07:46.436 --> 00:07:51.477
where you are sitting. If you want to go
out, you know how to walk out.

00:07:51.678 --> 00:07:56.488
But when, in the darkness you are there,
you just don’t understand

00:07:56.689 --> 00:08:04.428
and you go on behaving in a manner
which is, which cannot be explained

00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:08.831
otherwise, except that, because you are
a human being.

00:08:09.032 --> 00:08:14.079
Animals don’t do like that. Animals have
limitation [on them].

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:21.070
The animals, if they find something wrong,
something absolutely

00:08:21.277 --> 00:08:26.212
harmful done to them, then they will attack
or run away,

00:08:26.413 --> 00:08:31.434
but they do not carry a kind of a hatred
or anything.

00:08:31.635 --> 00:08:36.157
But they can carry the impression of fear,
could be,

00:08:36.358 --> 00:08:42.429
of some sort of a harm done to them.
But human beings are not like that.

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:51.978
Human beings don’t have any particular
reason, as such, to hate someone.

00:08:52.179 --> 00:08:58.914
But why it works out? Because they are
involved in their ego.

00:08:59.115 --> 00:09:08.458
Egoistical person feels that he has a right
to do what he wants to do:

00:09:08.691 --> 00:09:15.496
he can kill anybody, he can bomb anyone,
he can do whatever he likes.

00:09:16.385 --> 00:09:21.897
But a person who is not doing that,
is the other way round:

00:09:22.098 --> 00:09:26.939
he is frightened, he is afraid of someone.

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:31.934
Now the awareness moves on. This is
a subtler awareness,

00:09:32.135 --> 00:09:38.980
because, if you are afraid of somebody,
you would not like to go to his house,

00:09:39.181 --> 00:09:44.659
you will avoid him in the street,
all things you can do.

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:49.361
So all this kind of knowledge about other
human beings also

00:09:49.562 --> 00:09:53.038
accumulates in your mind.

00:09:53.239 --> 00:10:02.389
Then this thing starts working on
a collective level,

00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:07.051
because you think, “This group is very bad.
They are good.

00:10:07.252 --> 00:10:12.075
These are bad. They are excellent!”
like that, it works out.

00:10:12.276 --> 00:10:19.011
In your own mind you think that somebody
has a group,

00:10:19.212 --> 00:10:23.568
and the other group is better or that group
is better.

00:10:23.769 --> 00:10:33.629
And collectively, then, you start working
out your whole temperament, your awareness.

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:37.873
Like once people decide that say,
for example,

00:10:38.074 --> 00:10:45.892
that black people are to be finished,
so all the white people can join together.

00:10:46.093 --> 00:10:54.077
Or like at the time of Hitler, he decided
that all other human beings but Germans

00:10:54.278 --> 00:10:59.479
were useless. So he gathered people around
his thought and ideas.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:04.600
And this collective awareness just
comes to,

00:11:04.801 --> 00:11:08.819
I don’t know how, but it enters into
the minds of many.

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:14.469
They never challenge it, they never ask
[about] it, whether it is correct or not.

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:21.295
So this grows more and more and more,
and then it becomes like a –

00:11:21.892 --> 00:11:27.968
country-wise, you can say – an awareness
of this kind of a feeling.

00:11:28.169 --> 00:11:37.711
But whether it is correct or not is not
understood, is not known.

00:11:37.912 --> 00:11:43.355
So, what is important [is] that you should
know Reality,

00:11:43.556 --> 00:11:48.176
you should know exactly what is right
and what is wrong.

00:11:48.377 --> 00:11:58.313
For that, as I told you, there is this
great power of Kundalini within you.

00:11:58.868 --> 00:12:02.002
She is the one, She passes through
all these centres,

00:12:02.203 --> 00:12:08.448
enlightens them first of all, so your
awareness gets enlightened.

00:12:08.649 --> 00:12:14.093
And when She pierces through Sahastrara,
She joins you

00:12:14.294 --> 00:12:22.569
to this All-pervading Power which is
Knowledge,

00:12:23.862 --> 00:12:30.694
which is love, which is Truth.

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:36.502
So, after that, you immediately know –

00:12:37.159 --> 00:12:41.324
some people don’t know immediately,
but some people do –

00:12:41.525 --> 00:12:50.324
that what we have been thinking so far,
of separating ourselves from others

00:12:50.525 --> 00:12:54.477
by thinking they are not all right, they are
wrong, they are whatever it is –

00:12:54.678 --> 00:12:58.755
this disappears. This disappears
completely,

00:12:58.956 --> 00:13:02.708
and then you realise that your awareness
itself,

00:13:02.914 --> 00:13:08.345
awareness itself is dominated by so many
other circumstances.

00:13:08.546 --> 00:13:12.552
For example, where you were born, what
your parents taught you,

00:13:12.753 --> 00:13:15.649
what experiences you have had.

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:20.878
And then you realise that it was all wrong,
because it’s not Reality.

00:13:21.079 --> 00:13:26.374
Whatever feelings you have, whatever
ideas you have

00:13:26.575 --> 00:13:33.834
about another person or about other nation,
all of them are not correct.

00:13:34.035 --> 00:13:41.892
Because now your Sahastrara is awakened,
that it is connected now

00:13:42.093 --> 00:13:48.578
to the All-pervading Power. So this
starts flowing into you.

00:13:48.779 --> 00:13:57.829
This - I should say - enlightened awareness,
it starts flowing down into your being,

00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:06.069
in your brain, and then on your nerves
you can feel that awareness.

00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:12.447
Now once you want to know about something,
whether it is right or wrong –

00:14:12.648 --> 00:14:16.265
absolute right and wrong, it’s not [a]
question of relative –

00:14:16.466 --> 00:14:21.319
you just have to put your hands towards
that person,

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:24.509
or towards that thing or whatever it is:

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:29.289
immediately on these vibrations you
will know.

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:34.217
So what are these vibrations, is this
Paramachaitanya,

00:14:34.418 --> 00:14:41.304
we call it ‘Brahmachaitanya’, which starts
flowing through your finger tips.

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:46.444
Now you start feeling what chakras
they are catching,

00:14:46.645 --> 00:14:53.908
whether they are right or wrong, and your
discretion improves immensely.

00:14:54.109 --> 00:14:57.831
The brain, which was putting you
in delusions

00:14:58.032 --> 00:15:02.694
and wrong type of life, immediately
corrects itself.

00:15:02.895 --> 00:15:08.382
For example, I’m walking in a place
with my eyes closed,

00:15:08.583 --> 00:15:15.267
and there is a big ditch. I can’t see it,
I’m just walking.

00:15:15.468 --> 00:15:18.711
And suddenly I open my eyes and see
the ditch:

00:15:18.912 --> 00:15:22.837
immediately I know it’s wrong and I give up
and come away.

00:15:23.038 --> 00:15:28.868
In the same way it happens to you when
your Sahastrara is enlightened.

00:15:29.069 --> 00:15:34.925
Whatever you had gathered, knowledge,
whatever you think was right,

00:15:35.126 --> 00:15:40.575
whatever was your dream and your aims
of life, all these aspirations,

00:15:40.776 --> 00:15:43.305
they melt away.

00:15:43.506 --> 00:15:50.437
And then you take to reality and you start
seeing the reality of everything.

00:15:50.638 --> 00:15:59.035
Unless and until you see that reality, you
will be going with [the] other crowd:

00:15:59.236 --> 00:16:01.565
“These people are saying so, so let’s
do that.”

00:16:01.766 --> 00:16:07.060
“They are saying so, so let’s do that”.
But you cannot see whether it is correct

00:16:07.261 --> 00:16:13.367
or not, it’s good for you or not, or
whether it is going to help you.

00:16:13.568 --> 00:16:19.561
This kind of thing is so common
in the whole world

00:16:19.762 --> 00:16:26.458
and that’s why there is so much problem.
Because they don’t know the reality.

00:16:26.659 --> 00:16:31.263
Once you know the reality, most of
the problems can be finished,

00:16:31.464 --> 00:16:35.262
because this brain itself is creating
problems.

00:16:35.463 --> 00:16:41.456
First of all, it commits all kinds
of atrocities, violence, everything;

00:16:41.657 --> 00:16:47.592
then it also justifies itself, and then
it does even worse things.

00:16:47.793 --> 00:16:55.081
All this, they used to call it as ‘sin’, but
now in Sahaja Yoga, that’s finished now.

00:16:55.303 --> 00:17:00.104
Whatever your brain was contaminated with
is now cleansed.

00:17:00.305 --> 00:17:04.898
It has got the knowledge and through
the knowledge you can make out

00:17:05.099 --> 00:17:10.166
what is right and what is wrong.
Up to this point is all right.

00:17:10.367 --> 00:17:19.097
But then you must have full understanding
that, whatever [is] right, is right,

00:17:19.298 --> 00:17:25.358
and whatever [is] wrong is wrong, and we
should not do anything that is wrong,

00:17:25.559 --> 00:17:31.359
always do the right. You have to decide
on that point.

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:36.685
”Now we have to do the right only,
never the wrong”.

00:17:36.886 --> 00:17:42.076
This, when it comes to your mind, then
what starts is your determination:

00:17:42.277 --> 00:17:47.856
what we call as devotion, dedication,
surrendering.

00:17:50.099 --> 00:17:58.174
With that, you give up all your false ideas
and all your false pride,

00:17:58.375 --> 00:18:01.257
all other things that you have been doing
so far,

00:18:01.458 --> 00:18:07.646
and immediately you become a different
person, a beautiful person.

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:16.309
Now the third thing that happens to you,
which never happened to you before,

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:23.731
[is] that you feel that: “Unless and until
I give the same state to other people

00:18:23.932 --> 00:18:30.220
it won’t be all right, it won’t be -
all right for me to talk to them”.

00:18:30.421 --> 00:18:33.758
So you start talking to your brothers,
sisters.

00:18:33.959 --> 00:18:38.628
Then you start talking to other people,
then you start talking to...

00:18:38.829 --> 00:18:42.422
[the] whole nation you can talk about
Sahaja Yoga,

00:18:42.623 --> 00:18:49.947
that, “I have gained so much, I have got
these things; so now, why not you take it?”

00:18:50.148 --> 00:18:53.667
But to expect that by talking,
by discussion,

00:18:53.868 --> 00:18:58.381
by arguments, by sermoning…
they will never take.

00:18:58.582 --> 00:19:06.289
Because their brain, as I told you, is just
the same - still full of ignorance.

00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:10.141
So what you have to do is to raise
their Kundalini.

00:19:10.342 --> 00:19:15.246
Once you raise their Kundalini and their
brain opens,

00:19:15.447 --> 00:19:21.440
then they are on the same line as yourself.
They don’t have to worry

00:19:21.641 --> 00:19:29.831
about what is good and what is bad,
they know [it] themselves.

00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:39.426
Now that is what is very important.
To correct this world is very important:

00:19:39.627 --> 00:19:43.958
that you all should know what is right
and what is wrong.

00:19:44.159 --> 00:19:51.498
And you have a vehicle of Paramachaitanya
to know what is wrong and what is right.

00:19:51.699 --> 00:19:56.522
Now this strength starts moving and,
as you see, there are

00:19:56.723 --> 00:20:01.297
so many people, today, with their open
Sahastrara.

00:20:01.498 --> 00:20:07.965
So opening Sahastrara was the most
important part of the evolutionary process.

00:20:08.166 --> 00:20:13.438
All the evolution process brought human
beings to what level?

00:20:13.639 --> 00:20:21.605
We had wars, we had all kinds of silly
programmes

00:20:21.806 --> 00:20:28.336
by which we really ruined so many
countries, so many people.

00:20:29.079 --> 00:20:37.059
Now when you are one with that
All-pervading Power: It’s a pure power.

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:43.105
It’s a nirmal power. Absolutely pure
power.

00:20:43.306 --> 00:20:49.092
That gives you complete sense and complete
understanding

00:20:49.293 --> 00:20:57.272
as to how you should move, how you should
live, and what you should have.

00:20:57.609 --> 00:21:02.189
This is what is Self-realisation, they say.

00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:08.370
But I would say that Self-realisation is
much further than that.

00:21:08.571 --> 00:21:15.699
Even if your brain is enriched by
the Knowledge, the Real Knowledge,

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:20.108
still there are other things which you
should have.

00:21:20.309 --> 00:21:26.284
And the most important thing is that
you have to be

00:21:26.485 --> 00:21:31.966
completely aware – again I say word
‘aware’ –

00:21:32.167 --> 00:21:41.636
of where you stand in this big plan
of world global transformation.

00:21:41.837 --> 00:21:46.357
What is your position? What are you
supposed to do

00:21:46.558 --> 00:21:53.180
for this global transformation? What is
your position?

00:21:53.394 --> 00:22:00.074
Where do you stand? What is the work
for you to be done?

00:22:00.275 --> 00:22:08.155
Now you’ve got this compulsion on you,
that, “I have to do something.”

00:22:08.356 --> 00:22:14.348
When this compulsion starts working
on you, which is not dreadful,

00:22:14.549 --> 00:22:22.039
which is not annoying, but very peaceful
and joyful,

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:28.177
which says that, “I have to see that others
also know themselves!”

00:22:28.378 --> 00:22:34.449
So to know themselves is, first of all
you must know your own chakras.

00:22:35.124 --> 00:22:40.477
Yes, many people get their Realisation,
I know, very quickly.

00:22:40.678 --> 00:22:44.838
But they do not settle down with
their chakras.

00:22:45.039 --> 00:22:49.518
They have to see to their chakras: why you
have problems on your chakras.

00:22:49.719 --> 00:22:53.391
They will know they have problems,
but they still go on

00:22:53.592 --> 00:22:58.264
without paying attention or without looking
at it.

00:22:58.465 --> 00:23:02.799
To them it is a kind of a

00:23:05.566 --> 00:23:11.430
by the way [style], you can say: that,
“These problems are with me doesn’t matter.

00:23:11.631 --> 00:23:18.709
But what does it matter as long as I am
working out Sahaja Yoga?”

00:23:18.895 --> 00:23:23.348
It is not only for others, but for yourself
also!

00:23:23.549 --> 00:23:28.582
Is important that you should get your
chakras corrected.

00:23:28.783 --> 00:23:33.946
That’s the most important thing for you,
and then you will have Self-knowledge,

00:23:34.147 --> 00:23:38.073
in the sense [that] you will know what is
the defect, where is the defect,

00:23:38.274 --> 00:23:44.470
”What am I doing wrong? What should I do?”
And then when you correct it,

00:23:44.671 --> 00:23:48.864
when you correct those centres, then
your awareness,

00:23:49.065 --> 00:23:53.789
I would say, will be really, fully
enlightened about all the world.

00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:57.347
Now, it’s a tremendous thing – it’s very
tremendous.

00:23:57.548 --> 00:24:03.020
Because if you have to transform this mad
world into something very sane,

00:24:03.221 --> 00:24:07.551
and if we have to give them all
Self-realisation,

00:24:07.752 --> 00:24:13.657
imagine the task, how great it is, how many
people we need to do it.

00:24:13.834 --> 00:24:21.442
But if your willpower is strong about it
and you see – you feel compelled to do it.

00:24:21.643 --> 00:24:26.574
But normally, you see, we are compelled
because we have to run our houses,

00:24:26.775 --> 00:24:31.227
we have to earn money, we have to do this,
we have to do that.

00:24:31.428 --> 00:24:38.671
That you can do. But main object of your
life is to transform people

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:46.696
and to work it out, this transformation –
for the global peace.

00:24:46.897 --> 00:24:50.833
I don’t know [if] it has been predicted
or not,

00:24:51.034 --> 00:24:54.133
that a complete transformation will take
place,

00:24:54.334 --> 00:24:58.933
but they have talked about transformation.
I don’t know that part,

00:24:59.134 --> 00:25:05.455
and I just don’t bother my head as to how
many people are getting transformed.

00:25:05.656 --> 00:25:10.850
But after transformation you must settle
down.

00:25:11.051 --> 00:25:16.002
First of all you should see if you are
a peaceful person,

00:25:16.162 --> 00:25:20.823
if there’s peace in your heart.
If you have no peace in your heart

00:25:21.024 --> 00:25:25.837
then you are not a Sahaja Yogi.
If you get excited

00:25:26.038 --> 00:25:32.545
and if you start shouting at people and all
that, it means you are not Sahaja Yogis.

00:25:32.746 --> 00:25:39.299
You have to have a very, very peaceful
temperament, that is very important.

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:45.311
Now with that peace what should be there,
[is] pure compassion.

00:25:47.239 --> 00:25:53.011
What you are doing is not for your benefit
or as such,

00:25:53.212 --> 00:26:02.587
but because you are compelled by this Force
to do good for others, to transform them.

00:26:02.788 --> 00:26:08.218
This is the greatest good you can do
to others, that their brains are put right,

00:26:08.419 --> 00:26:13.097
they get rid of their diseases, they get
rid of their problems. It’s all there.

00:26:13.298 --> 00:26:18.100
But, the first thing and the most important
thing that happens

00:26:18.301 --> 00:26:21.757
[is] that they get the power to transform
others.

00:26:21.958 --> 00:26:28.133
When you have that power to transform
others you should not waste it,

00:26:28.334 --> 00:26:33.031
you should not use it for yourself. That
means the growth is not complete.

00:26:33.232 --> 00:26:39.850
You must talk about it, you must tell
about it, and you must work it out.

00:26:40.051 --> 00:26:43.624
Wherever it is possible you have to work
it out.

00:26:43.825 --> 00:26:49.275
This is the way we can spread people
on a global level,

00:26:49.476 --> 00:26:52.799
who can get complete transformation.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.507
All our problems, whether in India
or anywhere,

00:26:58.708 --> 00:27:07.614
is because of human beings, because they
have been not enlightened.

00:27:07.815 --> 00:27:13.411
See, if you are enlightened you’ll have
no problem of any quarrelling

00:27:13.612 --> 00:27:17.059
or any fighting and all that.

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:23.985
If you are enlightened, then you will think
about others,

00:27:24.186 --> 00:27:29.398
others as if they are your own, bother
your heads about them.

00:27:29.599 --> 00:27:34.135
You will not think about yourself anymore.

00:27:34.336 --> 00:27:40.459
If you are enlightened then [there's]
no question of any violence in your head.

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:44.350
Nowadays in the name of religion,
in the name of everything,

00:27:44.551 --> 00:27:46.899
there is so much of violence.

00:27:47.122 --> 00:27:52.289
This violence can be easily corrected
if they all become Sahaja Yogis.

00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:57.749
Think, if all people become Sahaja Yogis,
how will they quarrel, for what?

00:27:57.950 --> 00:28:01.812
So this religion is there, but above
all these religions

00:28:02.013 --> 00:28:06.718
is the religion of Sahaja Yoga, where
you become one.

00:28:06.919 --> 00:28:11.614
And there all these quarrels of religions
will disappear.

00:28:12.203 --> 00:28:15.200
This is not the only problem we have
as human beings,

00:28:15.401 --> 00:28:18.807
we have some other problems also,
very serious.

00:28:19.008 --> 00:28:26.732
That is, we have a hankering.

00:28:27.463 --> 00:28:33.219
We are very greedy. We cannot adjust
yourself to any other circumstances.

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:37.388
We want to live in complete comfort and
this and that.

00:28:37.581 --> 00:28:43.069
But after this you can sleep anywhere, you
can eat anywhere, you need not eat.

00:28:43.248 --> 00:28:53.268
You become a person who is above all these
needs, all these demands, absolutely.

00:29:07.324 --> 00:29:12.900
Then you don’t worry, you don’t worry.
There’s worry for what?

00:29:13.101 --> 00:29:17.393
Supposing I get lost somewhere and the car
is going in a wrong way:

00:29:17.594 --> 00:29:21.957
all right, I have to go that way,
that’s why I’m going like that.

00:29:22.158 --> 00:29:24.909
What is there to feel upset about it?

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:32.094
So many things, small, big, happen in your
life for which you get upset.

00:29:32.295 --> 00:29:36.754
But now, with this blessing of Sahastrara,

00:29:36.955 --> 00:29:42.988
you’ll be amazed, there is help
from Paramchaitanya.

00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:52.092
And that means a tremendous help, because
it acts globally, it acts individually,

00:29:52.293 --> 00:29:59.200
it acts on communities, it acts on nations,

00:29:59.401 --> 00:30:08.449
because there is a Divine – what we call
‘Divine’ – where is a Divine play going on.

00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:14.031
And this Divine play plays tremendous
beautiful things,

00:30:14.232 --> 00:30:18.515
by which people start correcting
themselves.

00:30:18.716 --> 00:30:22.064
So, you should never be nervous, you should
never be upset,

00:30:22.265 --> 00:30:27.359
because you have the Divine Power
within you, and it will correct.

00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:33.388
It can correct anyone. I mean, recently
we had a case of one boy

00:30:33.589 --> 00:30:39.161
who was hit by a truck and they said
his lungs were smashed.

00:30:39.362 --> 00:30:43.939
Now, with the lungs smashed, nobody has
heard that they become normal.

00:30:44.145 --> 00:30:47.722
Not only they became normal, but he started
breathing normally.

00:30:47.923 --> 00:30:53.994
And now he is all right. Is only this work
is done by Paramchaitanya.

00:30:54.195 --> 00:30:58.484
You don’t have to do anything. Any problem
comes before you,

00:30:58.685 --> 00:31:05.270
before it really touches you, is solved
by the Paramchaitanya.

00:31:06.032 --> 00:31:13.051
But you must have full faith in yourself
and in Paramachaitanya

00:31:13.252 --> 00:31:18.653
and believe that you are a realised-soul.
Nobody can harm you.

00:31:18.854 --> 00:31:23.288
If they try to harm you, for the time
being, all right, you may suffer,

00:31:23.489 --> 00:31:28.483
but you don’t also feel the sufferings
and you get out of it.

00:31:28.684 --> 00:31:35.085
Such a security, such a proper guidance
is there.

00:31:35.286 --> 00:31:39.314
Also you are saved from all kinds
of attacks

00:31:39.515 --> 00:31:43.960
and all kinds of mistakes that you commit.

00:31:44.161 --> 00:31:51.451
It’s all such a big – I would say,
a Computer of Knowledge.

00:31:51.652 --> 00:31:58.507
He knows, It knows what you are doing
and what you should not do,

00:31:58.708 --> 00:32:04.442
where you are going and what should
not be your way.

00:32:04.643 --> 00:32:10.933
He knows, It knows everything, knows
everything about you.

00:32:11.134 --> 00:32:16.478
So then you have to become aware of It.

00:32:16.679 --> 00:32:21.123
Now this is the stage where I would say
that you have to be aware

00:32:21.324 --> 00:32:28.913
that you are realised-souls, you are
different,

00:32:29.114 --> 00:32:34.592
very unique. You are realised-souls,
you are not ordinary people.

00:32:34.793 --> 00:32:44.570
And that you are protected by this
Paramchaitanya. Nothing can change you,

00:32:44.771 --> 00:32:52.120
nothing can trouble you, nothing can
overpower you.

00:32:52.321 --> 00:32:57.383
Because you are not aware, also, of this
Paramachaitanya,

00:32:57.584 --> 00:33:01.368
that’s why you, a little bit, get worried.
And people write to me,

00:33:01.569 --> 00:33:05.612
“Mother, my - something wrong with
my daughter, something this thing."

00:33:05.813 --> 00:33:11.492
Everything can be corrected
by Paramchaitanya,

00:33:11.693 --> 00:33:15.742
if you know how to leave it to That,

00:33:16.559 --> 00:33:21.695
if you understand how you are one
with that Paramchaitanya,

00:33:21.896 --> 00:33:30.152
you are a part and parcel of that. And that
Paramchaitanya is looking after you.

00:33:30.353 --> 00:33:35.070
You don’t have [a] very conscious effort,

00:33:35.271 --> 00:33:41.089
there’s no need to have very conscious
effort. Accept life as it is.

00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:45.494
As it is, whatever life is there, accept.
Don’t retaliate,

00:33:45.695 --> 00:33:49.278
don’t get angry, don’t get upset.
Just accept.

00:33:49.479 --> 00:33:54.335
And you’ll enjoy the same life which
was irritating you!

00:33:54.536 --> 00:34:00.548
You will see the enjoying part of that,
and it will be so beautiful

00:34:00.749 --> 00:34:05.105
the way you will see that you’ll get over
all your problems,

00:34:05.306 --> 00:34:07.838
you’ll get over all your enemies.

00:34:08.039 --> 00:34:15.418
And a kind of a very fresh, beautiful
existence you’ll have.

00:34:15.619 --> 00:34:22.740
So now, as you are all Sahaja Yogis,
is a very great position.

00:34:22.941 --> 00:34:30.380
With that, if you humble down, humble down,
then you’ll be amazed to see

00:34:30.581 --> 00:34:37.689
that, you are absolutely in contact with
this Paramchaitanya;

00:34:37.890 --> 00:34:42.516
not only that, but you have become
Paramchaitanya.

00:34:45.481 --> 00:34:50.014
With this Paramchaitanya you can do
anything.

00:34:50.215 --> 00:34:56.530
I need not tell you what you can do,
because some of you may not believe.

00:34:56.731 --> 00:35:02.613
But that’s [what] my own experience is,
that, if you are the Paramchaitanya,

00:35:02.814 --> 00:35:08.098
if you know you are the Paramchaitanya,
then it keeps your dignity,

00:35:08.299 --> 00:35:14.509
it keeps your position, it keeps your world
and looks after you.

00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:19.851
And whatever is just said or desired,
you just get it.

00:35:20.052 --> 00:35:25.964
Your desires also change. Your desires
are not for stupid things,

00:35:26.165 --> 00:35:30.774
but for something that is very noble.

00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:37.783
Like, you want to transform people, you
want to do Sahaja Yoga work.

00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:42.028
All these desires are fulfilled fully,

00:35:42.229 --> 00:35:48.322
when you want to do it, you like it and
you think of it.

00:35:48.523 --> 00:35:52.458
It is something, even seeing something:

00:35:52.659 --> 00:35:57.126
if you see something and you are stunned
by that!

00:35:57.327 --> 00:36:06.162
Immediately Paramchaitanya will take over
and you will have no problems, no problems.

00:36:06.363 --> 00:36:14.608
Because the way we react to all these
difficulties and to so-called odds in life

00:36:14.809 --> 00:36:18.032
becomes a play, just a play.
You are amazed!

00:36:18.233 --> 00:36:22.409
You looked at it and finished!
Look at that, and finished!

00:36:22.610 --> 00:36:30.358
That is how it is the light, which goes into
the darkness and finishes the darkness.

00:36:30.559 --> 00:36:35.229
The darkness is finished, and our problems
are finished also.

00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:38.982
So this is what is our awareness has
to become.

00:36:39.183 --> 00:36:42.813
Awareness has to become Paramachaitanya.

00:36:43.014 --> 00:36:48.194
Then you get all the ideas, everything
that are Divine.

00:36:48.395 --> 00:36:55.887
But not only that, but also the help of
the Divine, all the solutions of the Divine.

00:36:56.088 --> 00:37:01.018
It’s something amazing! And everything
quietens down,

00:37:01.219 --> 00:37:07.527
everything settles down, and you are
amazed, watching all this,

00:37:07.728 --> 00:37:13.556
that you are the centre of doing
all these things.

00:37:13.757 --> 00:37:17.409
You are not aware that you are doing,
and you are this.

00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:22.081
That ego part is missing. But you
see it’s all happening around you,

00:37:22.282 --> 00:37:26.934
and then you are amazed how it is
happening.

00:37:27.135 --> 00:37:32.754
The whole lifestyle changes, the whole
understanding changes,

00:37:32.955 --> 00:37:39.438
and you become a great source of happiness,
joy and knowledge to others.

00:37:39.639 --> 00:37:45.904
You don’t have to study anything, you don’t
have to know much,

00:37:46.072 --> 00:37:52.233
but you will know about everything,
what is right and what is wrong.

00:37:53.384 --> 00:37:59.131
And then only you can tell the things
with complete authority

00:37:59.332 --> 00:38:04.665
that, “This is not right!” Like today,
we had a discussion on this point

00:38:04.866 --> 00:38:09.660
about the economic position and
the economics of modern times.

00:38:09.861 --> 00:38:17.487
I said, “Is all wrong, because it is
self-destructive.”

00:38:17.688 --> 00:38:24.162
It destroys the nations, if not your
nation, other nations.

00:38:24.363 --> 00:38:33.467
Then it also destroys your family life.
It destroys your value system.

00:38:33.668 --> 00:38:40.914
It completely destroys you. So what sort
of an economics is this?

00:38:41.115 --> 00:38:52.048
It’s just a show, just a, like a, you can
say, a balloon: it can burst any moment.

00:38:52.249 --> 00:38:55.589
I have seen people who are very rich,
very this thing,

00:38:55.790 --> 00:39:01.193
think no end of themselves [then] become
bankrupt. And very bankrupt become rich.

00:39:01.394 --> 00:39:08.133
So it’s [a] kind of a turmoil in which
they are jumping,

00:39:08.334 --> 00:39:14.417
from one shore to another shore. But
you are not. You watch that drama.

00:39:14.618 --> 00:39:21.049
You see all that drama, and with your peace
you can see everything, very calmly.

00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:25.450
Not, it’s not difficult for you to create
more people like this.

00:39:25.651 --> 00:39:32.190
It’s not difficult to transform this world.
The time has come, just ripe time.

00:39:32.391 --> 00:39:36.640
Like when the proper time comes,
the blossom time comes,

00:39:36.841 --> 00:39:42.253
so many flowers become fruits. So,
like that, you all have become.

00:39:42.454 --> 00:39:47.689
Now it is for you to create seeds to spread
Sahaja Yoga.

00:39:47.890 --> 00:39:53.030
You are at that level of awareness now
where Paramchaitanya is with you,

00:39:53.231 --> 00:39:59.193
absolutely part and parcel of you,
absolutely with you to give you

00:39:59.394 --> 00:40:08.354
all necessary help, all necessary prestige,
and also the personality.

00:40:10.067 --> 00:40:12.873
May God bless you all.
