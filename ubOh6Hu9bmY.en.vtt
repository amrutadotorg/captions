00:00:05.469 --> 00:00:10.027
The fourth dimension that they mentioned about,

00:00:10.674 --> 00:00:13.574
what do they mean by that? That is the thing.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.868
Warren: They call that transcendental state.

00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:17.958
But what?

00:00:18.129 --> 00:00:20.819
Warren: They can’t describe it.
(Here Mother says again “What?” while Warren is saying the word “describe”)

00:00:20.898 --> 00:00:24.034
They can’t describe it, you see. Supposing somebody has a low

00:00:24.168 --> 00:00:27.159
heartbeat, low pulse rate or

00:00:27.305 --> 00:00:30.205
has a low consumption of oxygen or anything.

00:00:30.318 --> 00:00:32.259
Warren: That’s not transcendental state.

00:00:32.372 --> 00:00:36.233
That is not transcendental state because you are still in the state

00:00:36.322 --> 00:00:41.876
where your attention is on your body.

00:00:42.322 --> 00:00:46.098
So it is not a transcendental, you will have to transcend.

00:00:46.196 --> 00:00:50.292
Transcendental means you have to jump onto the parasympathetic.

00:00:50.637 --> 00:00:53.370
See, we have four dimensions we can say.

00:00:53.483 --> 00:00:56.427
One is the dimension of the left sympathetic,

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.186
another is of the right sympathetic,

00:00:59.398 --> 00:01:03.226
then we have got the central nervous system,

00:01:03.353 --> 00:01:04.908
which is our conscious mind

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:07.409
and the fourth one is the parasympathetic.

00:01:07.521 --> 00:01:09.921
Does he jump on the parasympathetic?

00:01:10.165 --> 00:01:11.285
Warren: We do.

00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:16.563
Yes. In Sahaja Yoga you jump onto the parasympathetic;

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:19.385
means your attention starts controlling

00:01:19.476 --> 00:01:21.585
the parasympathetic nervous system.

00:01:21.664 --> 00:01:25.591
Then how do we prove it that we become the fourth dimension?

00:01:25.748 --> 00:01:30.123
First thing is, that the person, who becomes

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:38.068
the controller of the parasympathetic,

00:01:38.202 --> 00:01:41.394
becomes the “Auto”. He can do things.

00:01:42.577 --> 00:01:47.040
He can do things, like she can tell that

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.342
another person is suffering on these centers

00:01:52.777 --> 00:01:56.233
without going to any laboratory, without going to any

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:59.942
medical check-up, on the fingertips.

00:02:02.085 --> 00:02:06.761
So the person, who becomes the fourth dimension,

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.972
he becomes the “Auto”, which is the autonomous nervous system,

00:02:11.048 --> 00:02:13.181
you see, the “auto” part of it.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.600
He controls the parasympathetic.

00:02:16.037 --> 00:02:19.474
Now, when he controls the parasympathetic,

00:02:20.311 --> 00:02:26.284
he controls this supply to all the centers

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:32.322
through certain movements, through certain kind of technique.

00:02:33.874 --> 00:02:39.263
For example a person is suffering from some disease of the heart.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.981
Now, a normal person, who doesn’t have this fourth dimension,

00:02:46.082 --> 00:02:49.922
will not know that she is suffering from any heart trouble.

00:02:50.617 --> 00:02:54.345
He will have no idea, he’ll never feel his heart or anything,

00:02:54.468 --> 00:02:57.796
till he suddenly gets the attack, and then he dies.

00:02:58.073 --> 00:03:01.492
But at the very onset of it the person,

00:03:01.793 --> 00:03:05.505
who is in the fourth dimension that is the realized soul,

00:03:06.916 --> 00:03:12.813
can feel that something is going wrong with his heart.

00:03:13.884 --> 00:03:17.556
Also he knows how to cure himself,

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.997
the technique of curing himself, also he knows

00:03:22.198 --> 00:03:25.847
that he is the source of the medicines that he has to give,

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.480
is the vital force.

00:03:28.616 --> 00:03:37.956
So this is the fourth dimension, is a great potential,

00:03:38.146 --> 00:03:40.523
becoming a kinetic force,

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.114
like an egg becoming a bird.

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:53.725
So the egg we can see egg has no way of flying out,

00:03:53.937 --> 00:03:55.203
but the bird can.

00:03:55.281 --> 00:03:58.696
It is a tremendous difference between an egg and a bird.

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:00.259
So such a person,

00:04:00.527 --> 00:04:03.393
who gets Realization and gets establishes,

00:04:04.666 --> 00:04:06.346
is no more a person,

00:04:07.344 --> 00:04:10.544
who can be tested by these machines and all that,

00:04:10.697 --> 00:04:13.955
because these machines deal only with the physical side,

00:04:14.056 --> 00:04:15.856
but it is he who can test.

00:04:18.208 --> 00:04:22.112
Even a child, who is a realized-soul can test another person.

00:04:22.232 --> 00:04:24.832
You don’t need any machines with that.

00:04:25.033 --> 00:04:28.939
He becomes the one, who diagnoses; he becomes the one,

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:34.988
who cures; he becomes the person, who can soothe you.

00:04:35.424 --> 00:04:37.624
Not only that on physical level,

00:04:37.735 --> 00:04:40.871
but supposing somebody is emotionally disturbed,

00:04:41.641 --> 00:04:47.467
then such a person knows that

00:04:47.757 --> 00:04:50.491
another person is emotionally disturbed.

00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:57.943
He also knows precisely which center is disturbed;

00:04:59.339 --> 00:05:03.088
he also knows how to put that center right.

00:05:03.568 --> 00:05:06.960
You don’t have to go to lunatic asylum to get cured,

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:09.766
but a person, who has fourth dimension,

00:05:10.459 --> 00:05:13.382
can cure that person of that sickness,

00:05:13.617 --> 00:05:18.325
because he precisely knows where the trouble is and how to cure it.

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:28.798
So all the diseases, which are only physical, can be cured;

00:05:29.413 --> 00:05:32.392
which are the psychosomatic can be cured;

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.053
the combination of both can be cured.

00:05:35.384 --> 00:05:40.652
Any combination of these things can be cured by a person,

00:05:40.764 --> 00:05:42.649
who is an established Sahaja Yogi.

00:05:42.739 --> 00:05:50.432
But in case a disease has gone so far that it is irreparable

00:05:52.777 --> 00:05:58.144
or something artificial has been introduced in the body,

00:05:58.748 --> 00:06:02.181
as they put sticks, steel-sticks and all that,

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:06.478
then, Sahaja Yoga doesn’t work on dead things.

00:06:06.679 --> 00:06:08.279
It works on living.

00:06:08.554 --> 00:06:13.526
If the organ is still living, it can work out,

00:06:14.642 --> 00:06:17.906
but if it is not living, then it does not work out.

00:06:19.877 --> 00:06:22.743
It works out on eighty per cent of people,

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:27.711
but the twenty per cent of people on whom it cannot not work out,

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:31.256
are the people, who do not have

00:06:31.691 --> 00:06:35.039
a basic foundation to be a human being.

00:06:36.334 --> 00:06:40.847
They are like animals; their attitudes towards are animals,

00:06:41.584 --> 00:06:43.264
even worse than animals.

00:06:43.381 --> 00:06:49.968
So a state that could be a so-called fourth dimension

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:56.307
could be where a person is no more a human being;

00:06:58.875 --> 00:07:03.629
he becomes either a devil or a satanic person.

00:07:04.656 --> 00:07:07.522
This has to be accepted by medical science

00:07:08.093 --> 00:07:11.843
that there are people, who can be very devilish

00:07:12.692 --> 00:07:17.290
and they cannot ascend any further into the fourth dimension.

00:07:18.038 --> 00:07:22.668
The fourth dimension is not a mechanical process,

00:07:22.792 --> 00:07:25.525
but is a living process of the evolution

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:29.499
by which you evolve to a higher being.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:34.514
But for that you have to have some basic foundations.

00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:39.493
A person, who is an alcoholic, can be cured of alcohol,

00:07:39.804 --> 00:07:45.612
but a person, who is cheating himself,

00:07:46.282 --> 00:07:51.493
cheating other people, is cruel to others,

00:07:51.851 --> 00:07:55.416
or say, a person like Hitler, he cannot ascend.

00:07:56.109 --> 00:08:00.226
He’s gone beyond that stage, where we cannot cure him.

00:08:00.729 --> 00:08:05.170
We can cure animals, we can cure human beings,

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:10.181
but not people, who are abnormal

00:08:10.684 --> 00:08:16.564
or we can, there is no word for some the …, but satanic people,

00:08:17.825 --> 00:08:21.089
and that’s how it doesn’t work out in some people.

00:08:21.252 --> 00:08:33.750
Also the cases which have gone very down onto the state,

00:08:33.874 --> 00:08:40.473
where we can say now, absolutely out of order,

00:08:40.842 --> 00:08:47.705
then Sahaja Yoga allows such a body to take another birth and try.

00:08:48.308 --> 00:08:50.708
So because it’s a fourth dimension,

00:08:50.953 --> 00:08:56.002
we cannot take medical science as a vehicle

00:08:56.594 --> 00:09:00.242
to express everything, because this is higher than that.

00:09:03.134 --> 00:09:07.709
But in many ways we can medically show that

00:09:08.256 --> 00:09:13.635
people have been cured of anginas, of cancer, of leukemia,

00:09:13.725 --> 00:09:19.677
of everything through the vehicle of parasympathetic nervous system

00:09:19.901 --> 00:09:22.427
which doctors cannot handle.

00:09:24.861 --> 00:09:27.527
Because they have their own limitation,

00:09:27.617 --> 00:09:31.329
they cannot jump onto the parasympathetic nervous system,

00:09:32.629 --> 00:09:37.349
and that is why they cannot cure a person,

00:09:37.795 --> 00:09:40.462
who has problems of the parasympathetic.

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:45.696
All problems can be solved through parasympathetic in case

00:09:45.847 --> 00:09:49.999
there are basic conditions; if they are fulfilled.

00:09:50.513 --> 00:09:56.047
In the medical science people will even treat Hitler

00:09:58.458 --> 00:10:00.458
– there is no discrimination.

00:10:00.812 --> 00:10:02.636
But as you grow

00:10:02.748 --> 00:10:06.652
higher and higher even in evolution you become more discreet,

00:10:06.984 --> 00:10:10.493
and at this stage you cannot treat a person,

00:10:10.873 --> 00:10:21.678
who is a hypocrite or who is a cruel man or who is aggressive

00:10:21.801 --> 00:10:29.340
to others or who is practicing methods to subvert people.

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:35.338
And we have many gurus, who take money

00:10:36.845 --> 00:10:41.499
and destroy many people just for money’s sake.

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:44.119
Such people can never go to the fourth dimension,

00:10:44.203 --> 00:10:46.445
why should they talk about fourth dimension?

00:10:47.051 --> 00:10:53.437
Such people have to be something so extraordinary

00:10:54.395 --> 00:11:00.443
that they become righteous, virtuous, compassionate

00:11:02.378 --> 00:11:06.850
and very dynamic people.

00:11:07.749 --> 00:11:13.158
They have the greatest quality, is of compassion,

00:11:13.352 --> 00:11:16.252
which though we accept in our ordinary life,

00:11:16.361 --> 00:11:18.334
in medical science we do not accept.

00:11:18.471 --> 00:11:24.487
But on what basis is the medical science? Is compassion.

00:11:26.147 --> 00:11:28.623
So you become the compassion.

00:11:28.858 --> 00:11:31.982
This is the fire point is to be seen.

00:11:32.784 --> 00:11:36.688
When we talk of the fourth dimension, we talk of the beyond.

00:11:36.864 --> 00:11:41.152
And when we talk of the beyond, we have to project our mind to see

00:11:41.299 --> 00:11:43.545
what do we expect ourselves to be,

00:11:43.663 --> 00:11:46.329
when we become something of the beyond.

00:11:46.729 --> 00:11:50.975
Are we going to be the same mean, aggressive,

00:11:51.933 --> 00:11:57.088
complicated human being or are we going to be something

00:11:58.398 --> 00:11:59.518
like a saint?

00:12:03.437 --> 00:12:07.534
So this projection has to be brought in the minds of the doctors.

00:12:07.651 --> 00:12:10.151
Unless and until they project their minds to

00:12:10.327 --> 00:12:13.139
that extent to see that,

00:12:13.503 --> 00:12:17.534
“If we have to be at a higher position,

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:22.514
we have to accept that we have to be better people.”

00:12:24.429 --> 00:12:26.629
Now Sahaja Yoga is the synthesis

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:31.300
of all the three powers that are within us.

00:12:31.408 --> 00:12:33.608
The first is the physical power,

00:12:33.752 --> 00:12:35.608
the second is the emotional power

00:12:35.745 --> 00:12:38.212
and third is the evolutionary power.

00:12:38.812 --> 00:12:42.140
You become the synthesis of all these three powers.

00:12:42.405 --> 00:12:46.245
It’s not the analysis, but medical science is the analysis.

00:12:46.683 --> 00:12:49.939
So it just analyses physical side,

00:12:50.096 --> 00:12:52.963
goes on analyzing so that you have one

00:12:53.119 --> 00:12:56.639
doctor for one eye and another doctor for another eye.

00:12:56.791 --> 00:12:59.306
But a doctor has to understand

00:12:59.639 --> 00:13:05.439
that there is no solution for many problems that we have.

00:13:06.631 --> 00:13:10.342
So they have to raise their eyes higher

00:13:11.005 --> 00:13:13.949
to see that, “There must be something missing

00:13:14.145 --> 00:13:15.556
that we have to know.”

00:13:15.733 --> 00:13:18.028
Of course medical science is very important.

00:13:18.165 --> 00:13:22.109
Because once you get your Realization,

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:24.930
even you may not be a doctor,

00:13:25.235 --> 00:13:29.139
and you become established Sahaja Yogi, you can cure people.

00:13:29.395 --> 00:13:34.844
But with medical science you can prove that it has been cured.

00:13:35.626 --> 00:13:38.526
So medical science also has its own purpose.

00:13:39.434 --> 00:13:43.850
And the basics of medical science that is compassion,

00:13:44.221 --> 00:13:47.814
is now expressed through the human being,

00:13:47.933 --> 00:13:50.334
who becomes the embodiment of compassion.

00:13:50.433 --> 00:13:55.940
It’s not poetry, it’s not some sort of a abstract thing,

00:13:56.077 --> 00:14:02.274
but is a happening of evolution that has to take place

00:14:02.567 --> 00:14:07.801
and this is the last breakthrough about which many people,

00:14:07.977 --> 00:14:12.938
scientists and also doctors,

00:14:13.661 --> 00:14:16.561
we can say psychologists have talked about,

00:14:16.786 --> 00:14:19.253
though they are not taken seriously.

00:14:19.442 --> 00:14:23.026
So now there is time for us to think seriously about it

00:14:23.641 --> 00:14:30.855
and to know that we are not only this body, mind

00:14:31.168 --> 00:14:35.456
and ego, but we are something beyond that is the fourth dimension.

00:14:35.621 --> 00:14:37.301
And what are we there?

00:14:41.011 --> 00:14:46.437
We are the “Auto” and the “Auto” is called as “Self”.

00:14:49.036 --> 00:14:53.859
Unless and until you project your mind higher

00:14:55.148 --> 00:14:59.052
and do not get contented with what discoveries you have made

00:14:59.329 --> 00:15:01.750
on a physical gross level,

00:15:03.411 --> 00:15:06.547
you cannot see the point of view of Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:07.122 --> 00:15:11.410
And what is there to argue about? When Sahaja Yoga is curing people

00:15:12.121 --> 00:15:15.577
why do you argue? Why don’t you see how it is curing?

00:15:17.276 --> 00:15:21.123
Supposing a doctor is practicing,

00:15:21.451 --> 00:15:24.326
and people go and argue with him: “How do you cure?”

00:15:24.497 --> 00:15:25.530
You will tell him:

00:15:25.654 --> 00:15:27.995
“What do you mean? I’m not supposed to tell you all that,

00:15:28.117 --> 00:15:29.234
but I do cure”.

00:15:30.757 --> 00:15:35.045
Now you have a certificate, say from a medical college or somewhere

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:37.124
so you think you are a doctor,

00:15:37.262 --> 00:15:39.995
but supposing somebody has a certificate

00:15:41.676 --> 00:15:46.570
from the Divine Itself, then why not see,

00:15:46.765 --> 00:15:50.007
why not keep your eyes open like a scientist,

00:15:50.222 --> 00:15:54.538
why close them by whatever you have known so far.

00:15:54.675 --> 00:15:58.659
Why make a barrier out of the scientific research you have done,

00:15:58.777 --> 00:16:01.977
why not be a research student in Sahaja Yoga also

00:16:02.155 --> 00:16:05.803
and see for yourself that you really achieve that state.

00:16:05.932 --> 00:16:07.999
You have to become that state.

00:16:08.275 --> 00:16:11.859
While those who talk of the fourth dimension otherwise,

00:16:11.948 --> 00:16:14.748
make people mad, they make them lunatics.

00:16:15.346 --> 00:16:19.955
They end up as lost races.

00:16:20.912 --> 00:16:23.512
So how can that be a fourth dimension?

00:16:23.647 --> 00:16:26.380
There are so many cases of these people,

00:16:26.575 --> 00:16:31.867
one can show that doing those horrible courses and things

00:16:31.985 --> 00:16:33.918
they have become really mad.

00:16:34.075 --> 00:16:36.672
And they are good for nothing, they are cheats.

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:39.738
They are doing all the bad things that one can do.

00:16:39.876 --> 00:16:43.996
So how can you say that this meditation helps anyone

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:47.336
to be a better person or better person in health?

00:16:48.195 --> 00:16:53.235
Moreover, to be only all right in health is not sufficient.

00:16:53.508 --> 00:16:55.508
One must also see that point.

00:16:55.715 --> 00:16:59.704
One should not be so much attached to the body,

00:16:59.861 --> 00:17:02.223
because supposing if you have all the wrestlers

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:05.427
or boxers in this country, now take a position like that,

00:17:05.544 --> 00:17:09.320
then what will happen? As it is, we have too many of them.

00:17:12.849 --> 00:17:16.495
Now what we need, are the saints.

00:17:17.707 --> 00:17:22.042
Not physically over-healthy people,

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:29.816
who will try to boss over others, but people, who are saints,

00:17:30.402 --> 00:17:41.603
who can help without charging any money, without any aggression,

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:48.810
out of compassion, effortlessly those who are suffering physically.

00:17:51.916 --> 00:17:55.255
But there is another barrier,

00:17:55.392 --> 00:17:57.592
which must be told very frankly,

00:17:58.224 --> 00:18:03.048
that when you become a Sahaja Yogi

00:18:05.256 --> 00:18:14.611
the vital forces of new dimension start flowing effortlessly

00:18:16.505 --> 00:18:19.568
and you do not charge any money for that.

00:18:19.802 --> 00:18:21.869
You enjoy your own compassion.

00:18:23.865 --> 00:18:27.065
Compassion, that is the basis of medical science.

00:18:29.959 --> 00:18:37.581
So that state maybe doctors may not try to have.

00:18:38.011 --> 00:18:41.171
But there are many, many people,

00:18:41.445 --> 00:18:43.778
who cannot be cured by Sahaja Yoga

00:18:44.409 --> 00:18:46.831
and they can come to doctors,

00:18:46.949 --> 00:18:49.749
so doctors should not have fears about it.

00:18:50.644 --> 00:18:54.839
How many people can be helped by Sahaja Yoga,

00:18:55.445 --> 00:18:56.725
cannot be said,

00:18:57.925 --> 00:19:02.046
but those who come to Sahaja Yoga can be helped.

00:19:02.339 --> 00:19:08.569
So it should be at least accepted as a

00:19:09.742 --> 00:19:18.498
higher type of redemption or a curing power,

00:19:20.216 --> 00:19:24.123
which must be accepted and those who can be cured by that,

00:19:24.319 --> 00:19:25.999
must be given a chance

00:19:26.252 --> 00:19:28.919
and there should be no barrier about it.

00:19:31.311 --> 00:19:38.905
Warren: What is this parasympathetic in fact,

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:43.754
if it is described in medical science as the thing that balances,

00:19:44.003 --> 00:19:45.995
brings everything in back into balance.

00:19:46.113 --> 00:19:49.198
It depends on, it depends on.

00:19:49.921 --> 00:19:52.655
It is actually the evolutionary process.

00:19:52.753 --> 00:19:56.132
You see, parasympathetic works

00:19:57.421 --> 00:20:00.752
at different levels of our evolution.

00:20:00.929 --> 00:20:05.323
Say, at the stage when you are matter, it organizes you

00:20:05.968 --> 00:20:07.648
in the periodic tables.

00:20:10.577 --> 00:20:14.580
Who does that organization? Is parasympathetic.

00:20:16.886 --> 00:20:21.136
Then, when you rise higher as an animal,

00:20:22.055 --> 00:20:29.339
then it gives you the understanding of eating food,

00:20:29.848 --> 00:20:34.417
seeking food by which animals seek food.

00:20:36.215 --> 00:20:45.142
Then as it rises higher it gives you another feeling of protection,

00:20:45.455 --> 00:20:49.321
you seek protection. Animals also seek protections.

00:20:49.615 --> 00:20:54.067
That’s how the evolution goes on – by giving these

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:56.672
feelings within us or we can say

00:20:56.789 --> 00:21:00.693
as the parasympathetic starts manifesting higher and higher,

00:21:01.438 --> 00:21:05.734
the seeking starts becoming higher and higher.

00:21:06.711 --> 00:21:09.933
Then comes up to the human state,

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:14.816
where people seek food, protection.

00:21:16.067 --> 00:21:22.658
Then when they achieve that, they seek power,

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:26.740
they seek money, they seek possessions,

00:21:27.268 --> 00:21:30.880
they seek possession of other people,

00:21:31.096 --> 00:21:33.429
which is sometimes called as love.

00:21:34.475 --> 00:21:36.875
They seek all kinds of such things,

00:21:37.522 --> 00:21:43.296
but still their seeking is not finished, still they are seeking.

00:21:43.727 --> 00:21:48.082
Then the same parasympathetic creates an urge within us

00:21:48.316 --> 00:21:50.916
that we have to seek something higher.

00:21:52.125 --> 00:22:02.855
This last feeling after human stage is to be manifested,

00:22:03.109 --> 00:22:06.585
and for that there is a residual force

00:22:06.781 --> 00:22:09.448
placed within us called as ‘Kundalini’,

00:22:11.039 --> 00:22:14.175
which is actually the power of desire within us,

00:22:14.418 --> 00:22:16.618
which has manifested everything.

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:22.748
But still it is residual, because it is not yet manifested itself.

00:22:22.914 --> 00:22:25.858
Because this is the power of desire to be one

00:22:26.723 --> 00:22:29.817
with the Divine vital force.

00:22:30.853 --> 00:22:34.368
And that’s why it rests in the sacrum bone

00:22:34.525 --> 00:22:37.981
– ‘sacrum’ meaning ‘sacred’, so people knew about it.

00:22:38.704 --> 00:22:41.341
And then when this force rises

00:22:42.766 --> 00:22:45.022
through the various centers

00:22:45.179 --> 00:22:47.913
and pierces through the fontanel bone area,

00:22:48.031 --> 00:22:54.593
you actually get the cool-breeze coming out of your head.

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:58.840
For that you don’t need any medical science,

00:22:59.066 --> 00:23:02.126
any laboratory, just put your hand on top of such a person

00:23:02.263 --> 00:23:05.232
and you get the cool-breeze coming out of such a person.

00:23:05.349 --> 00:23:06.845
Not only that, but

00:23:06.943 --> 00:23:09.954
that person himself feels the cool-breeze coming out of his head.

00:23:10.092 --> 00:23:14.990
And after some time he feels it coming out of his own hands.

00:23:15.595 --> 00:23:23.212
Then he tries to use it. When he uses that, he finds that,

00:23:23.603 --> 00:23:29.403
this is the power that works out all the cures.

00:23:30.068 --> 00:23:32.626
So one has to realize and accept

00:23:33.037 --> 00:23:38.620
that at the stage of the human level you cannot

00:23:39.167 --> 00:23:43.737
achieve the fourth dimension.

00:23:44.109 --> 00:23:46.442
You have to become something more.

00:23:46.843 --> 00:23:51.936
And this is the thing where the

00:23:52.132 --> 00:23:56.526
people who want to cheat you for money have used,

00:23:56.820 --> 00:24:01.155
that what you become, is a possessed person.

00:24:02.894 --> 00:24:06.158
They brainwash you; you become a different person.

00:24:06.605 --> 00:24:10.125
They put some possessions in you, you become possessed

00:24:10.257 --> 00:24:15.485
and you think that you have already being something different.

00:24:15.759 --> 00:24:20.544
But to be different is not the point, to be higher is to be seen.

00:24:22.242 --> 00:24:27.414
And higher means the one, who has full control over himself;

00:24:28.508 --> 00:24:31.203
who is completely relaxed,

00:24:31.985 --> 00:24:37.472
who is at peace, who is compassionate

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:39.920
and who is a higher personality.

00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:48.043
Anybody, who is physically fit,

00:24:48.157 --> 00:24:51.183
by no chance is a very evolved person

00:24:51.418 --> 00:24:53.885
or who has got the fourth dimension.

00:24:54.464 --> 00:24:57.273
On the contrary, they also come to Me and ask Me,

00:24:57.410 --> 00:24:59.090
“Mother, give us peace”.

00:25:17.809 --> 00:25:22.477
Warren: If sympathetic is a case of living in extremes

00:25:23.648 --> 00:25:26.912
and parasympathetic is a case of living in balance.

00:25:27.048 --> 00:25:32.024
But you see what I said is that it is parasympathetic in totality,

00:25:32.165 --> 00:25:35.442
say in one word, see you must make it clear cut

00:25:35.579 --> 00:25:39.074
that it does give balance at a point, you see.

00:25:39.446 --> 00:25:47.961
Balance is a result of trial and error, is a result.

00:25:48.352 --> 00:25:50.486
How do you get on to a bicycle?

00:25:50.637 --> 00:25:53.879
First you make mistakes, you wobble,

00:25:54.016 --> 00:25:56.616
then you fall down, then you’ll learn.

00:26:07.939 --> 00:26:09.619
You can talk to them.

00:26:10.673 --> 00:26:16.200
If you have to say that physical wellbeing is not the end of it.

00:26:16.454 --> 00:26:17.454
Hello,

00:26:18.876 --> 00:26:24.462
Shridevi! Shridevi, how are you?

00:26:25.653 --> 00:26:28.837
Shridevi, are you all right?

00:26:32.568 --> 00:26:34.368
How are you feeling today?

00:26:35.634 --> 00:26:38.524
Today you are not crying at all.

00:26:41.893 --> 00:26:43.573
(Trying to lift her up.)

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:49.840
This is the cool breeze coming out.

00:26:52.811 --> 00:26:53.851
Much better?

00:26:55.409 --> 00:26:57.542
I worked on her last night. Aah!

00:27:01.199 --> 00:27:02.479
Hello Shridevi!

00:27:03.699 --> 00:27:05.219
(A child is crying)

00:27:05.359 --> 00:27:09.402
No! No! Not to cry.
