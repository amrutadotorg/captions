00:05.469 --> 00:10.027
The fourth dimension that they mentioned about,

00:10.674 --> 00:13.574
what do they mean by that? That is the thing.

00:13.710 --> 00:16.868
Warren: They call that transcendental state.

00:16.958 --> 00:17.958
But what?

00:18.129 --> 00:20.819
Warren: They can’t describe it.
(Here Mother says again “What?” while Warren is saying the word “describe”)

00:20.898 --> 00:24.034
They can’t describe it, you see. Supposing somebody has a low

00:24.168 --> 00:27.159
heartbeat, low pulse rate or

00:27.305 --> 00:30.205
has a low consumption of oxygen or anything.

00:30.318 --> 00:32.259
Warren: That’s not transcendental state.

00:32.372 --> 00:36.233
That is not transcendental state because you are still in the state

00:36.322 --> 00:41.876
where your attention is on your body.

00:42.322 --> 00:46.098
So it is not a transcendental, you will have to transcend.

00:46.196 --> 00:50.292
Transcendental means you have to jump onto the parasympathetic.

00:50.637 --> 00:53.370
See, we have four dimensions we can say.

00:53.483 --> 00:56.427
One is the dimension of the left sympathetic,

00:56.720 --> 00:59.186
another is of the right sympathetic,

00:59.398 --> 01:03.226
then we have got the central nervous system,

01:03.353 --> 01:04.908
which is our conscious mind

01:04.999 --> 01:07.409
and the fourth one is the parasympathetic.

01:07.521 --> 01:09.921
Does he jump on the parasympathetic?

01:10.165 --> 01:11.285
Warren: We do.

01:11.405 --> 01:16.563
Yes. In Sahaja Yoga you jump onto the parasympathetic;

01:16.719 --> 01:19.385
means your attention starts controlling

01:19.476 --> 01:21.585
the parasympathetic nervous system.

01:21.664 --> 01:25.591
Then how do we prove it that we become the fourth dimension?

01:25.748 --> 01:30.123
First thing is, that the person, who becomes

01:31.820 --> 01:38.068
the controller of the parasympathetic,

01:38.202 --> 01:41.394
becomes the “Auto”. He can do things.

01:42.577 --> 01:47.040
He can do things, like she can tell that

01:48.570 --> 01:52.342
another person is suffering on these centers

01:52.777 --> 01:56.233
without going to any laboratory, without going to any

01:56.349 --> 01:59.942
medical check-up, on the fingertips.

02:02.085 --> 02:06.761
So the person, who becomes the fourth dimension,

02:06.940 --> 02:10.972
he becomes the “Auto”, which is the autonomous nervous system,

02:11.048 --> 02:13.181
you see, the “auto” part of it.

02:13.400 --> 02:15.600
He controls the parasympathetic.

02:16.037 --> 02:19.474
Now, when he controls the parasympathetic,

02:20.311 --> 02:26.284
he controls this supply to all the centers

02:26.899 --> 02:32.322
through certain movements, through certain kind of technique.

02:33.874 --> 02:39.263
For example a person is suffering from some disease of the heart.

02:41.060 --> 02:45.981
Now, a normal person, who doesn’t have this fourth dimension,

02:46.082 --> 02:49.922
will not know that she is suffering from any heart trouble.

02:50.617 --> 02:54.345
He will have no idea, he’ll never feel his heart or anything,

02:54.468 --> 02:57.796
till he suddenly gets the attack, and then he dies.

02:58.073 --> 03:01.492
But at the very onset of it the person,

03:01.793 --> 03:05.505
who is in the fourth dimension that is the realized soul,

03:06.916 --> 03:12.813
can feel that something is going wrong with his heart.

03:13.884 --> 03:17.556
Also he knows how to cure himself,

03:18.170 --> 03:21.997
the technique of curing himself, also he knows

03:22.198 --> 03:25.847
that he is the source of the medicines that he has to give,

03:25.960 --> 03:27.480
is the vital force.

03:28.616 --> 03:37.956
So this is the fourth dimension, is a great potential,

03:38.146 --> 03:40.523
becoming a kinetic force,

03:42.220 --> 03:46.114
like an egg becoming a bird.

03:47.409 --> 03:53.725
So the egg we can see egg has no way of flying out,

03:53.937 --> 03:55.203
but the bird can.

03:55.281 --> 03:58.696
It is a tremendous difference between an egg and a bird.

03:58.819 --> 04:00.259
So such a person,

04:00.527 --> 04:03.393
who gets Realization and gets establishes,

04:04.666 --> 04:06.346
is no more a person,

04:07.344 --> 04:10.544
who can be tested by these machines and all that,

04:10.697 --> 04:13.955
because these machines deal only with the physical side,

04:14.056 --> 04:15.856
but it is he who can test.

04:18.208 --> 04:22.112
Even a child, who is a realized-soul can test another person.

04:22.232 --> 04:24.832
You don’t need any machines with that.

04:25.033 --> 04:28.939
He becomes the one, who diagnoses; he becomes the one,

04:29.129 --> 04:34.988
who cures; he becomes the person, who can soothe you.

04:35.424 --> 04:37.624
Not only that on physical level,

04:37.735 --> 04:40.871
but supposing somebody is emotionally disturbed,

04:41.641 --> 04:47.467
then such a person knows that

04:47.757 --> 04:50.491
another person is emotionally disturbed.

04:51.708 --> 04:57.943
He also knows precisely which center is disturbed;

04:59.339 --> 05:03.088
he also knows how to put that center right.

05:03.568 --> 05:06.960
You don’t have to go to lunatic asylum to get cured,

05:07.099 --> 05:09.766
but a person, who has fourth dimension,

05:10.459 --> 05:13.382
can cure that person of that sickness,

05:13.617 --> 05:18.325
because he precisely knows where the trouble is and how to cure it.

05:20.380 --> 05:28.798
So all the diseases, which are only physical, can be cured;

05:29.413 --> 05:32.392
which are the psychosomatic can be cured;

05:32.520 --> 05:35.053
the combination of both can be cured.

05:35.384 --> 05:40.652
Any combination of these things can be cured by a person,

05:40.764 --> 05:42.649
who is an established Sahaja Yogi.

05:42.739 --> 05:50.432
But in case a disease has gone so far that it is irreparable

05:52.777 --> 05:58.144
or something artificial has been introduced in the body,

05:58.748 --> 06:02.181
as they put sticks, steel-sticks and all that,

06:02.450 --> 06:06.478
then, Sahaja Yoga doesn’t work on dead things.

06:06.679 --> 06:08.279
It works on living.

06:08.554 --> 06:13.526
If the organ is still living, it can work out,

06:14.642 --> 06:17.906
but if it is not living, then it does not work out.

06:19.877 --> 06:22.743
It works out on eighty per cent of people,

06:24.039 --> 06:27.711
but the twenty per cent of people on whom it cannot not work out,

06:27.789 --> 06:31.256
are the people, who do not have

06:31.691 --> 06:35.039
a basic foundation to be a human being.

06:36.334 --> 06:40.847
They are like animals; their attitudes towards are animals,

06:41.584 --> 06:43.264
even worse than animals.

06:43.381 --> 06:49.968
So a state that could be a so-called fourth dimension

06:50.169 --> 06:56.307
could be where a person is no more a human being;

06:58.875 --> 07:03.629
he becomes either a devil or a satanic person.

07:04.656 --> 07:07.522
This has to be accepted by medical science

07:08.093 --> 07:11.843
that there are people, who can be very devilish

07:12.692 --> 07:17.290
and they cannot ascend any further into the fourth dimension.

07:18.038 --> 07:22.668
The fourth dimension is not a mechanical process,

07:22.792 --> 07:25.525
but is a living process of the evolution

07:25.640 --> 07:29.499
by which you evolve to a higher being.

07:29.800 --> 07:34.514
But for that you have to have some basic foundations.

07:35.909 --> 07:39.493
A person, who is an alcoholic, can be cured of alcohol,

07:39.804 --> 07:45.612
but a person, who is cheating himself,

07:46.282 --> 07:51.493
cheating other people, is cruel to others,

07:51.851 --> 07:55.416
or say, a person like Hitler, he cannot ascend.

07:56.109 --> 08:00.226
He’s gone beyond that stage, where we cannot cure him.

08:00.729 --> 08:05.170
We can cure animals, we can cure human beings,

08:05.650 --> 08:10.181
but not people, who are abnormal

08:10.684 --> 08:16.564
or we can, there is no word for some the …, but satanic people,

08:17.825 --> 08:21.089
and that’s how it doesn’t work out in some people.

08:21.252 --> 08:33.750
Also the cases which have gone very down onto the state,

08:33.874 --> 08:40.473
where we can say now, absolutely out of order,

08:40.842 --> 08:47.705
then Sahaja Yoga allows such a body to take another birth and try.

08:48.308 --> 08:50.708
So because it’s a fourth dimension,

08:50.953 --> 08:56.002
we cannot take medical science as a vehicle

08:56.594 --> 09:00.242
to express everything, because this is higher than that.

09:03.134 --> 09:07.709
But in many ways we can medically show that

09:08.256 --> 09:13.635
people have been cured of anginas, of cancer, of leukemia,

09:13.725 --> 09:19.677
of everything through the vehicle of parasympathetic nervous system

09:19.901 --> 09:22.427
which doctors cannot handle.

09:24.861 --> 09:27.527
Because they have their own limitation,

09:27.617 --> 09:31.329
they cannot jump onto the parasympathetic nervous system,

09:32.629 --> 09:37.349
and that is why they cannot cure a person,

09:37.795 --> 09:40.462
who has problems of the parasympathetic.

09:41.920 --> 09:45.696
All problems can be solved through parasympathetic in case

09:45.847 --> 09:49.999
there are basic conditions; if they are fulfilled.

09:50.513 --> 09:56.047
In the medical science people will even treat Hitler

09:58.458 --> 10:00.458
– there is no discrimination.

10:00.812 --> 10:02.636
But as you grow

10:02.748 --> 10:06.652
higher and higher even in evolution you become more discreet,

10:06.984 --> 10:10.493
and at this stage you cannot treat a person,

10:10.873 --> 10:21.678
who is a hypocrite or who is a cruel man or who is aggressive

10:21.801 --> 10:29.340
to others or who is practicing methods to subvert people.

10:31.070 --> 10:35.338
And we have many gurus, who take money

10:36.845 --> 10:41.499
and destroy many people just for money’s sake.

10:41.610 --> 10:44.119
Such people can never go to the fourth dimension,

10:44.203 --> 10:46.445
why should they talk about fourth dimension?

10:47.051 --> 10:53.437
Such people have to be something so extraordinary

10:54.395 --> 11:00.443
that they become righteous, virtuous, compassionate

11:02.378 --> 11:06.850
and very dynamic people.

11:07.749 --> 11:13.158
They have the greatest quality, is of compassion,

11:13.352 --> 11:16.252
which though we accept in our ordinary life,

11:16.361 --> 11:18.334
in medical science we do not accept.

11:18.471 --> 11:24.487
But on what basis is the medical science? Is compassion.

11:26.147 --> 11:28.623
So you become the compassion.

11:28.858 --> 11:31.982
This is the fire point is to be seen.

11:32.784 --> 11:36.688
When we talk of the fourth dimension, we talk of the beyond.

11:36.864 --> 11:41.152
And when we talk of the beyond, we have to project our mind to see

11:41.299 --> 11:43.545
what do we expect ourselves to be,

11:43.663 --> 11:46.329
when we become something of the beyond.

11:46.729 --> 11:50.975
Are we going to be the same mean, aggressive,

11:51.933 --> 11:57.088
complicated human being or are we going to be something

11:58.398 --> 11:59.518
like a saint?

12:03.437 --> 12:07.534
So this projection has to be brought in the minds of the doctors.

12:07.651 --> 12:10.151
Unless and until they project their minds to

12:10.327 --> 12:13.139
that extent to see that,

12:13.503 --> 12:17.534
“If we have to be at a higher position,

12:18.530 --> 12:22.514
we have to accept that we have to be better people.”

12:24.429 --> 12:26.629
Now Sahaja Yoga is the synthesis

12:28.400 --> 12:31.300
of all the three powers that are within us.

12:31.408 --> 12:33.608
The first is the physical power,

12:33.752 --> 12:35.608
the second is the emotional power

12:35.745 --> 12:38.212
and third is the evolutionary power.

12:38.812 --> 12:42.140
You become the synthesis of all these three powers.

12:42.405 --> 12:46.245
It’s not the analysis, but medical science is the analysis.

12:46.683 --> 12:49.939
So it just analyses physical side,

12:50.096 --> 12:52.963
goes on analyzing so that you have one

12:53.119 --> 12:56.639
doctor for one eye and another doctor for another eye.

12:56.791 --> 12:59.306
But a doctor has to understand

12:59.639 --> 13:05.439
that there is no solution for many problems that we have.

13:06.631 --> 13:10.342
So they have to raise their eyes higher

13:11.005 --> 13:13.949
to see that, “There must be something missing

13:14.145 --> 13:15.556
that we have to know.”

13:15.733 --> 13:18.028
Of course medical science is very important.

13:18.165 --> 13:22.109
Because once you get your Realization,

13:22.930 --> 13:24.930
even you may not be a doctor,

13:25.235 --> 13:29.139
and you become established Sahaja Yogi, you can cure people.

13:29.395 --> 13:34.844
But with medical science you can prove that it has been cured.

13:35.626 --> 13:38.526
So medical science also has its own purpose.

13:39.434 --> 13:43.850
And the basics of medical science that is compassion,

13:44.221 --> 13:47.814
is now expressed through the human being,

13:47.933 --> 13:50.334
who becomes the embodiment of compassion.

13:50.433 --> 13:55.940
It’s not poetry, it’s not some sort of a abstract thing,

13:56.077 --> 14:02.274
but is a happening of evolution that has to take place

14:02.567 --> 14:07.801
and this is the last breakthrough about which many people,

14:07.977 --> 14:12.938
scientists and also doctors,

14:13.661 --> 14:16.561
we can say psychologists have talked about,

14:16.786 --> 14:19.253
though they are not taken seriously.

14:19.442 --> 14:23.026
So now there is time for us to think seriously about it

14:23.641 --> 14:30.855
and to know that we are not only this body, mind

14:31.168 --> 14:35.456
and ego, but we are something beyond that is the fourth dimension.

14:35.621 --> 14:37.301
And what are we there?

14:41.011 --> 14:46.437
We are the “Auto” and the “Auto” is called as “Self”.

14:49.036 --> 14:53.859
Unless and until you project your mind higher

14:55.148 --> 14:59.052
and do not get contented with what discoveries you have made

14:59.329 --> 15:01.750
on a physical gross level,

15:03.411 --> 15:06.547
you cannot see the point of view of Sahaja Yoga.

15:07.122 --> 15:11.410
And what is there to argue about? When Sahaja Yoga is curing people

15:12.121 --> 15:15.577
why do you argue? Why don’t you see how it is curing?

15:17.276 --> 15:21.123
Supposing a doctor is practicing,

15:21.451 --> 15:24.326
and people go and argue with him: “How do you cure?”

15:24.497 --> 15:25.530
You will tell him:

15:25.654 --> 15:27.995
“What do you mean? I’m not supposed to tell you all that,

15:28.117 --> 15:29.234
but I do cure”.

15:30.757 --> 15:35.045
Now you have a certificate, say from a medical college or somewhere

15:35.250 --> 15:37.124
so you think you are a doctor,

15:37.262 --> 15:39.995
but supposing somebody has a certificate

15:41.676 --> 15:46.570
from the Divine Itself, then why not see,

15:46.765 --> 15:50.007
why not keep your eyes open like a scientist,

15:50.222 --> 15:54.538
why close them by whatever you have known so far.

15:54.675 --> 15:58.659
Why make a barrier out of the scientific research you have done,

15:58.777 --> 16:01.977
why not be a research student in Sahaja Yoga also

16:02.155 --> 16:05.803
and see for yourself that you really achieve that state.

16:05.932 --> 16:07.999
You have to become that state.

16:08.275 --> 16:11.859
While those who talk of the fourth dimension otherwise,

16:11.948 --> 16:14.748
make people mad, they make them lunatics.

16:15.346 --> 16:19.955
They end up as lost races.

16:20.912 --> 16:23.512
So how can that be a fourth dimension?

16:23.647 --> 16:26.380
There are so many cases of these people,

16:26.575 --> 16:31.867
one can show that doing those horrible courses and things

16:31.985 --> 16:33.918
they have become really mad.

16:34.075 --> 16:36.672
And they are good for nothing, they are cheats.

16:36.790 --> 16:39.738
They are doing all the bad things that one can do.

16:39.876 --> 16:43.996
So how can you say that this meditation helps anyone

16:44.200 --> 16:47.336
to be a better person or better person in health?

16:48.195 --> 16:53.235
Moreover, to be only all right in health is not sufficient.

16:53.508 --> 16:55.508
One must also see that point.

16:55.715 --> 16:59.704
One should not be so much attached to the body,

16:59.861 --> 17:02.223
because supposing if you have all the wrestlers

17:02.360 --> 17:05.427
or boxers in this country, now take a position like that,

17:05.544 --> 17:09.320
then what will happen? As it is, we have too many of them.

17:12.849 --> 17:16.495
Now what we need, are the saints.

17:17.707 --> 17:22.042
Not physically over-healthy people,

17:22.320 --> 17:29.816
who will try to boss over others, but people, who are saints,

17:30.402 --> 17:41.603
who can help without charging any money, without any aggression,

17:41.740 --> 17:48.810
out of compassion, effortlessly those who are suffering physically.

17:51.916 --> 17:55.255
But there is another barrier,

17:55.392 --> 17:57.592
which must be told very frankly,

17:58.224 --> 18:03.048
that when you become a Sahaja Yogi

18:05.256 --> 18:14.611
the vital forces of new dimension start flowing effortlessly

18:16.505 --> 18:19.568
and you do not charge any money for that.

18:19.802 --> 18:21.869
You enjoy your own compassion.

18:23.865 --> 18:27.065
Compassion, that is the basis of medical science.

18:29.959 --> 18:37.581
So that state maybe doctors may not try to have.

18:38.011 --> 18:41.171
But there are many, many people,

18:41.445 --> 18:43.778
who cannot be cured by Sahaja Yoga

18:44.409 --> 18:46.831
and they can come to doctors,

18:46.949 --> 18:49.749
so doctors should not have fears about it.

18:50.644 --> 18:54.839
How many people can be helped by Sahaja Yoga,

18:55.445 --> 18:56.725
cannot be said,

18:57.925 --> 19:02.046
but those who come to Sahaja Yoga can be helped.

19:02.339 --> 19:08.569
So it should be at least accepted as a

19:09.742 --> 19:18.498
higher type of redemption or a curing power,

19:20.216 --> 19:24.123
which must be accepted and those who can be cured by that,

19:24.319 --> 19:25.999
must be given a chance

19:26.252 --> 19:28.919
and there should be no barrier about it.

19:31.311 --> 19:38.905
Warren: What is this parasympathetic in fact,

19:39.530 --> 19:43.754
if it is described in medical science as the thing that balances,

19:44.003 --> 19:45.995
brings everything in back into balance.

19:46.113 --> 19:49.198
It depends on, it depends on.

19:49.921 --> 19:52.655
It is actually the evolutionary process.

19:52.753 --> 19:56.132
You see, parasympathetic works

19:57.421 --> 20:00.752
at different levels of our evolution.

20:00.929 --> 20:05.323
Say, at the stage when you are matter, it organizes you

20:05.968 --> 20:07.648
in the periodic tables.

20:10.577 --> 20:14.580
Who does that organization? Is parasympathetic.

20:16.886 --> 20:21.136
Then, when you rise higher as an animal,

20:22.055 --> 20:29.339
then it gives you the understanding of eating food,

20:29.848 --> 20:34.417
seeking food by which animals seek food.

20:36.215 --> 20:45.142
Then as it rises higher it gives you another feeling of protection,

20:45.455 --> 20:49.321
you seek protection. Animals also seek protections.

20:49.615 --> 20:54.067
That’s how the evolution goes on – by giving these

20:54.420 --> 20:56.672
feelings within us or we can say

20:56.789 --> 21:00.693
as the parasympathetic starts manifesting higher and higher,

21:01.438 --> 21:05.734
the seeking starts becoming higher and higher.

21:06.711 --> 21:09.933
Then comes up to the human state,

21:10.910 --> 21:14.816
where people seek food, protection.

21:16.067 --> 21:22.658
Then when they achieve that, they seek power,

21:23.850 --> 21:26.740
they seek money, they seek possessions,

21:27.268 --> 21:30.880
they seek possession of other people,

21:31.096 --> 21:33.429
which is sometimes called as love.

21:34.475 --> 21:36.875
They seek all kinds of such things,

21:37.522 --> 21:43.296
but still their seeking is not finished, still they are seeking.

21:43.727 --> 21:48.082
Then the same parasympathetic creates an urge within us

21:48.316 --> 21:50.916
that we have to seek something higher.

21:52.125 --> 22:02.855
This last feeling after human stage is to be manifested,

22:03.109 --> 22:06.585
and for that there is a residual force

22:06.781 --> 22:09.448
placed within us called as ‘Kundalini’,

22:11.039 --> 22:14.175
which is actually the power of desire within us,

22:14.418 --> 22:16.618
which has manifested everything.

22:18.460 --> 22:22.748
But still it is residual, because it is not yet manifested itself.

22:22.914 --> 22:25.858
Because this is the power of desire to be one

22:26.723 --> 22:29.817
with the Divine vital force.

22:30.853 --> 22:34.368
And that’s why it rests in the sacrum bone

22:34.525 --> 22:37.981
– ‘sacrum’ meaning ‘sacred’, so people knew about it.

22:38.704 --> 22:41.341
And then when this force rises

22:42.766 --> 22:45.022
through the various centers

22:45.179 --> 22:47.913
and pierces through the fontanel bone area,

22:48.031 --> 22:54.593
you actually get the cool-breeze coming out of your head.

22:55.940 --> 22:58.840
For that you don’t need any medical science,

22:59.066 --> 23:02.126
any laboratory, just put your hand on top of such a person

23:02.263 --> 23:05.232
and you get the cool-breeze coming out of such a person.

23:05.349 --> 23:06.845
Not only that, but

23:06.943 --> 23:09.954
that person himself feels the cool-breeze coming out of his head.

23:10.092 --> 23:14.990
And after some time he feels it coming out of his own hands.

23:15.595 --> 23:23.212
Then he tries to use it. When he uses that, he finds that,

23:23.603 --> 23:29.403
this is the power that works out all the cures.

23:30.068 --> 23:32.626
So one has to realize and accept

23:33.037 --> 23:38.620
that at the stage of the human level you cannot

23:39.167 --> 23:43.737
achieve the fourth dimension.

23:44.109 --> 23:46.442
You have to become something more.

23:46.843 --> 23:51.936
And this is the thing where the

23:52.132 --> 23:56.526
people who want to cheat you for money have used,

23:56.820 --> 24:01.155
that what you become, is a possessed person.

24:02.894 --> 24:06.158
They brainwash you; you become a different person.

24:06.605 --> 24:10.125
They put some possessions in you, you become possessed

24:10.257 --> 24:15.485
and you think that you have already being something different.

24:15.759 --> 24:20.544
But to be different is not the point, to be higher is to be seen.

24:22.242 --> 24:27.414
And higher means the one, who has full control over himself;

24:28.508 --> 24:31.203
who is completely relaxed,

24:31.985 --> 24:37.472
who is at peace, who is compassionate

24:37.720 --> 24:39.920
and who is a higher personality.

24:45.910 --> 24:48.043
Anybody, who is physically fit,

24:48.157 --> 24:51.183
by no chance is a very evolved person

24:51.418 --> 24:53.885
or who has got the fourth dimension.

24:54.464 --> 24:57.273
On the contrary, they also come to Me and ask Me,

24:57.410 --> 24:59.090
“Mother, give us peace”.

25:17.809 --> 25:22.477
Warren: If sympathetic is a case of living in extremes

25:23.648 --> 25:26.912
and parasympathetic is a case of living in balance.

25:27.048 --> 25:32.024
But you see what I said is that it is parasympathetic in totality,

25:32.165 --> 25:35.442
say in one word, see you must make it clear cut

25:35.579 --> 25:39.074
that it does give balance at a point, you see.

25:39.446 --> 25:47.961
Balance is a result of trial and error, is a result.

25:48.352 --> 25:50.486
How do you get on to a bicycle?

25:50.637 --> 25:53.879
First you make mistakes, you wobble,

25:54.016 --> 25:56.616
then you fall down, then you’ll learn.

26:07.939 --> 26:09.619
You can talk to them.

26:10.673 --> 26:16.200
If you have to say that physical wellbeing is not the end of it.

26:16.454 --> 26:17.454
Hello,

26:18.876 --> 26:24.462
Shridevi! Shridevi, how are you?

26:25.653 --> 26:28.837
Shridevi, are you all right?

26:32.568 --> 26:34.368
How are you feeling today?

26:35.634 --> 26:38.524
Today you are not crying at all.

26:41.893 --> 26:43.573
(Trying to lift her up.)

26:47.440 --> 26:49.840
This is the cool breeze coming out.

26:52.811 --> 26:53.851
Much better?

26:55.409 --> 26:57.542
I worked on her last night. Aah!

27:01.199 --> 27:02.479
Hello Shridevi!

27:03.699 --> 27:05.219
(A child is crying)

27:05.359 --> 27:09.402
No! No! Not to cry.
