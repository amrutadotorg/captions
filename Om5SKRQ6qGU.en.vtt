00:14.920 --> 00:19.199
family

00:16.320 --> 00:20.640
whatever you do it should please me is

00:19.199 --> 00:23.680
is one of the ways

00:20.640 --> 00:23.680
it should please me

00:28.560 --> 00:34.160
that's one of the signs so how do we do

00:32.079 --> 00:37.200
it put me in your heart

00:34.160 --> 00:38.079
just try to put me in your heart it's

00:37.200 --> 00:45.680
very simple

00:38.079 --> 00:47.520
i'm before you now i am in person

00:45.680 --> 00:49.039
i was trying to give realization to one

00:47.520 --> 00:53.039
of my relations yes

00:49.039 --> 00:54.559
today and i said that you don't lose

00:53.039 --> 00:57.039
your eyes he said no

00:54.559 --> 00:58.800
i'm not looking at your face because

00:57.039 --> 01:01.840
when i see you

00:58.800 --> 01:04.479
i feel you are my aunt

01:01.840 --> 01:05.439
but i'm just looking at your feet so

01:04.479 --> 01:07.520
that

01:05.439 --> 01:09.439
i shouldn't feel any more that you are

01:07.520 --> 01:12.159
my aunt

01:09.439 --> 01:15.439
you are very great and your face is the

01:12.159 --> 01:17.439
one that puts me into illusions

01:15.439 --> 01:18.560
he could see it's a mahamaya he said

01:17.439 --> 01:22.159
only at your feet

01:18.560 --> 01:25.360
i look and through your feet only

01:22.159 --> 01:28.400
i can get over this barrier this feeling

01:25.360 --> 01:31.680
in the same way when i am a mahamaya i

01:28.400 --> 01:31.680
know i am i had to be

01:34.479 --> 01:41.840
but you have to put my

01:37.600 --> 01:41.840
feet into your heart

01:47.920 --> 01:52.640
just by feet into your heart

01:53.759 --> 02:00.560
because photo face everything

01:57.280 --> 02:00.560
might be an illusion

02:02.159 --> 02:10.479
might be by seeing my face you do not

02:06.960 --> 02:10.479
get over your barriers

02:14.879 --> 02:21.680
to say i must see mother i must do this

02:19.360 --> 02:23.360
mother must come to my house she must

02:21.680 --> 02:26.080
have food at my place

02:23.360 --> 02:28.080
she must visit my home all this is so

02:26.080 --> 02:36.480
stupid i cannot understand what's the

02:28.080 --> 02:39.280
matter with these people

02:36.480 --> 02:40.640
mother please come in my heart let me

02:39.280 --> 02:43.280
clean my heart

02:40.640 --> 02:45.760
so that you are there put your feet into

02:43.280 --> 02:45.760
my heart

02:47.440 --> 02:52.000
let your feet be worshipped in my heart

02:52.720 --> 03:00.319
let me not be in delusion

02:56.720 --> 03:05.200
take me away from illusions

03:00.319 --> 03:08.720
keep me in reality take away the sheen

03:05.200 --> 03:12.080
of superficiality let me

03:08.720 --> 03:16.560
enjoy your feet in my heart

03:12.080 --> 03:16.560
let me see your feet in my heart

03:17.599 --> 03:20.640
only such people

03:21.280 --> 03:24.400
even brahma vishnu mahesha have done

03:23.280 --> 03:27.840
that

03:24.400 --> 03:27.840
so don't you think you have to do it

03:30.640 --> 03:35.680
so humble down yourself humble down

03:34.400 --> 03:38.879
yourself

03:35.680 --> 03:42.400
in your heart humble down in your

03:38.879 --> 03:44.319
heart enjoy your humility enjoy your

03:42.400 --> 03:46.640
virtues

03:44.319 --> 03:49.280
the greatest virtue of sahaja yogi is

03:46.640 --> 03:49.280
humility

03:50.239 --> 03:57.760
now so many things you have seen

03:53.360 --> 03:58.319
to convince you but in no way it can

03:57.760 --> 04:01.680
mean

03:58.319 --> 04:04.080
any kind of subjection

04:01.680 --> 04:06.799
because what subjection you can give me

04:04.080 --> 04:06.799
think of that

04:08.400 --> 04:15.840
when every subjection is a blessing what

04:11.439 --> 04:15.840
subjection you are giving

04:17.120 --> 04:23.440
every feeling in the heart is a blessing

04:20.880 --> 04:26.080
just just now you feel it and you feel

04:23.440 --> 04:26.080
the joy

04:27.040 --> 04:29.840
in your heart

04:30.639 --> 04:36.320
then what is your subjection about what

04:34.639 --> 04:38.320
i can understand people who are just

04:36.320 --> 04:41.680
newly calm or good for nothing

04:38.320 --> 04:44.960
just but you are not on the periphery

04:41.680 --> 04:46.639
but some of them do go into periphery in

04:44.960 --> 04:50.080
no time you give them some work

04:46.639 --> 04:52.560
finish if i am sweet to someone finished

04:50.080 --> 04:53.600
if i see someone finished i mean this is

04:52.560 --> 04:57.840
too much

04:53.600 --> 04:57.840
i can't even be nice to you

05:04.960 --> 05:08.479
if you do any mistakes or anything then

05:07.759 --> 05:11.840
you feel

05:08.479 --> 05:11.840
then you get your left visually

05:12.000 --> 05:16.080
you've done your mistake or not finish

05:13.919 --> 05:17.520
it you love me

05:16.080 --> 05:19.120
maybe there's something wrong in the

05:17.520 --> 05:20.000
love or maybe something has happened

05:19.120 --> 05:24.080
doesn't matter

05:20.000 --> 05:26.639
now i'm going to be cautious

05:24.080 --> 05:27.280
i'm not going to make any mistakes how

05:26.639 --> 05:30.320
could i

05:27.280 --> 05:31.280
do this mistake because i i was not

05:30.320 --> 05:33.039
fully in love

05:31.280 --> 05:34.479
if i had loved something i would have

05:33.039 --> 05:37.840
not done such a mistake

05:34.479 --> 05:38.639
all right so develop your love no you

05:37.840 --> 05:40.880
will do

05:38.639 --> 05:43.039
i feel guilty because i have done such a

05:40.880 --> 05:43.039
thing

05:44.400 --> 05:49.360
so you miss this and that both so your

05:46.639 --> 05:51.759
mistake becomes a barrier again

05:49.360 --> 05:53.680
don't feel guilty about it we have to

05:51.759 --> 05:55.440
progress further forget the past

05:53.680 --> 05:57.280
forget the past forget the past we have

05:55.440 --> 05:59.600
to go further we have to be serious

05:57.280 --> 05:59.600
people

06:01.440 --> 06:04.880
when we talk we should talk with that

06:03.199 --> 06:07.840
dignity of that

06:04.880 --> 06:07.840
or

06:10.639 --> 06:15.039
that's very important and once you

06:13.199 --> 06:17.600
develop that all your ekadasha will

06:15.039 --> 06:17.600
disappear

06:19.759 --> 06:34.080
ekadasha will disappear just think of

06:21.840 --> 06:37.360
the awe

06:34.080 --> 06:40.639
the silence and the joy and the

06:37.360 --> 06:46.080
the joy of the

06:40.639 --> 06:46.080
o is deep very deep like a sea

06:47.199 --> 06:51.759
see on superficial level is very

06:49.199 --> 06:54.960
turbulent but inside is

06:51.759 --> 07:00.240
silent absolutely silent feel

06:54.960 --> 07:00.240
that depth without all you cannot go

07:00.840 --> 07:03.840
down
