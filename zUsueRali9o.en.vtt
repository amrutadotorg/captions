WEBVTT

00:04.001 --> 00:10.553
Before that, we will do
our program in this regard

00:10.553 --> 00:18.552
I want to tell you something. You should
listen to it peacefully and imbibe it.

00:27.202 --> 00:30.312
The thing that I have to tell you is that,

00:32.812 --> 00:39.063
You all are watching that Many
people are sahajyogi in delhi.

00:39.063 --> 00:43.774
And have become very good SahajaYogis.

00:45.572 --> 00:47.487
The message I gave was that we

00:50.525 --> 00:58.332
have to increase both vertical and
horizontal brains in the same way.

00:58.332 --> 01:01.032
That is why we should pay
attention to this.

01:02.532 --> 01:04.792
We must be alert

01:04.792 --> 01:07.692
Because we are very much responsible.

01:07.692 --> 01:09.842
The whole world is watching us today,

01:09.842 --> 01:12.742
Where did we have reach.

01:13.992 --> 01:19.042
What did we do, what did we get, and then

01:20.292 --> 01:23.152
another responsibility
is, what can we give it.

01:23.152 --> 01:29.952
If there is no balance and purity
in our life, in our behavior, in our

01:29.952 --> 01:35.952
conversation, then we
cannot attract anyone.

01:36.452 --> 01:38.977
Therefore it is very
important to have that purity

01:39.002 --> 01:43.152
in us and it is also
important to understand that.

01:43.965 --> 01:50.361
And all the problems
that we have had so far,

01:50.652 --> 01:55.902
we should also look at them completely

01:56.112 --> 01:58.864
and as you see it, it will
burn itself and then what.

02:01.322 --> 02:05.072
So we will see within ourselves. Whether
you look inside, our you see outside.

02:06.072 --> 02:07.082
Those things

02:09.382 --> 02:13.132
will break, which is
useless, will disappear.

02:13.582 --> 02:19.832
Will be destroyed in any way that
is indiscriminate for our progress.

02:20.592 --> 02:24.093
herefore our vision makes us wait

02:24.093 --> 02:29.993
and we should see how we
are moving in balance in and out.

02:31.995 --> 02:38.342
You are really like a
plant. Like you sow a seed.

02:40.251 --> 02:45.342
The moment the seed sprouts. You
distribute that seedling in yourself.

02:45.342 --> 02:48.092
Very soon sprouts will comes out.

02:49.342 --> 02:51.103
And grows on its own.

02:51.103 --> 02:57.352
So that seedling does not even have
to think about how we are growing.

02:57.352 --> 03:03.105
How are we heading towards the sun?

03:04.352 --> 03:06.711
At that time, understanding
is closed from inside.

03:06.711 --> 03:10.780
The way the plant grows in the sun.

03:10.804 --> 03:15.212
How does he take his life from the sun?

03:15.212 --> 03:21.275
How he take life and use it
completely and throw it away.

03:22.282 --> 03:26.782
He has same agenda all day.

03:26.782 --> 03:32.531
In which way its leaves fall in winter

03:32.531 --> 03:34.782
and its elements are found again.

03:34.782 --> 03:40.433
And then he also knows that this
Fall of leaves are also important.

03:40.433 --> 03:45.948
There is no bad thing in
it. They will get a kind of

03:49.242 --> 03:52.145
nitrogen from the leaves.
and it will make me big.

03:52.145 --> 03:57.502
All this understanding is tied inside it,

03:59.202 --> 04:05.452
whether it is Plant or whatever Creature
or animal, it is all tied to the soul.

04:05.452 --> 04:11.404
It is tied inside the understanding
of God. and On its own Keeps working

04:12.072 --> 04:15.912
And there is no need to explain them.

04:15.912 --> 04:19.293
They understand themselves.
In this way we have

04:19.318 --> 04:24.215
to grow, in which way
we have to move forward

04:24.215 --> 04:26.362
And in the same way, we
have to go to the height.

04:26.362 --> 04:28.473
Just like a mango
tree will go to its height.

04:28.474 --> 04:33.022
All of you will see this.

04:33.022 --> 04:36.074
These all happen on their own.

04:36.074 --> 04:40.572
If you go to a forest, you will not
smell anywhere, you will not see any dirt.

04:40.572 --> 04:44.573
As soon as a man reaches there, you
will come to know that here lives a man.

04:44.573 --> 04:49.232
Because if he is a human, there
will be dirt,there will be spoiled.

04:51.531 --> 04:55.531
Because the reason for that is
the blame is tied to human life,

04:55.531 --> 04:58.888
The wisdom that moves
inside them is the movement

04:58.913 --> 05:01.842
of Chaitanya. It is not
a question for them,

05:01.842 --> 05:08.141
can they do this work or
not. they should or should not.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.052
Because they do not even
have the idea of sin in them.

05:10.052 --> 05:14.553
There is no ego inside their thought
that we are doing this work.

05:14.553 --> 05:20.352
They do not think of sin and virtue. It
is good that it is bad, it is not a thought

05:20.352 --> 05:24.301
because there is no dilemma
in them. they are like that.

05:24.325 --> 05:27.662
Which seed you sow inside yourself
.The same flower will blossom.

05:27.662 --> 05:34.062
The same fruit will come out.And
grows completely on its own

05:34.062 --> 05:41.812
and will continue to grow
and accepts the path of the God.

05:43.174 --> 05:45.922
He will never have any problem

05:45.922 --> 05:49.222
He will not have any opinion
whether I should do it or not.

05:49.521 --> 05:56.122
It is definite or uncertain. if It is
good or bad.It will or will not benefit

05:56.122 --> 06:00.632
They don't see it for their own
benefit and not for anything else.

06:00.632 --> 06:05.182
The protection God has given to
those whose devotion is complete

06:05.182 --> 06:09.982
Their time is made by God in
such a way that they are protected.

06:10.482 --> 06:15.992
He will approve everything.

06:17.544 --> 06:20.204
If there will be a lion in the forest.

06:20.204 --> 06:22.842
If there will be a lion in the forest. So he will be the king.

06:22.842 --> 06:24.866
If he is a king, then we
believes that he is the king.

06:25.842 --> 06:27.602
So how do you believe that he is a king,

06:27.626 --> 06:31.002
because it is written in gods laws
that the lion is the king of the forest.

06:31.002 --> 06:34.103
Because the lion is
the king of the forest, he

06:34.128 --> 06:37.402
kills the animal, so no
one will touch that animal.

06:37.851 --> 06:45.102
Because that is the king's food.
No one, not even a bird, touches her.

06:45.102 --> 06:53.011
When the king eats it after 24 hours, the
little bird and the creature will eat it

06:53.011 --> 06:55.335
Then the little creature
will eat it And after

06:55.360 --> 06:57.462
that, some other
small animals will eat it.

06:57.462 --> 07:01.622
Their rule are made. There
is no big-small in them.

07:01.622 --> 07:04.873
All of them systematically eat that animal.

07:04.873 --> 07:12.422
But when the same lion kills any animals,in
that panic if you go to that forest.

07:12.422 --> 07:19.181
then there will be a peace. So it would
seem that everyone is afraid of him.

07:19.181 --> 07:22.718
If the lion is sitting anywhere,
the bird also does not choke.

07:22.743 --> 07:25.605
Rajasaheb (lion) is
sitting now, just sit quietly.

07:27.432 --> 07:33.044
No bird will be even noisy
if he is Snoring and sleeping.

07:33.044 --> 07:36.342
In this way you can save your life

07:36.803 --> 07:41.145
And the lion also remains calm because
he also have to kill only one animal

07:41.145 --> 07:44.645
that also in 15 days.He
do not kill animals every day.

07:44.645 --> 07:51.301
Do not eat someone
else's killed. do not Foul play.

07:53.001 --> 07:58.251
Scorpion lives like Scorpion , Snake
lives like Snake and Lion lives like Lion.

07:58.251 --> 08:03.312
In us scorpion,snakes,lions do not know
how the qualities of all the animals come.

08:03.361 --> 08:08.061
The reason is that God
has given us freedom.

08:08.861 --> 08:10.761
God said,do what you want to do.

08:11.111 --> 08:12.661
Live as you want to live

08:12.661 --> 08:16.371
Use your freedom by using in limitation

08:17.521 --> 08:21.271
Every man should understand his freedom.

08:21.271 --> 08:23.071
Know Your freedom First.

08:23.071 --> 08:27.971
Now with that freedom we get an attitude
that i'm doing this i'm doing that.

08:27.971 --> 08:30.231
And then the idea of sin and virtue comes.

08:30.231 --> 08:33.131
Sacraments also change in him.

08:33.155 --> 08:36.535
Like this thing is good this thing is bad.

08:36.536 --> 08:42.431
Whoever can tell me this. If he
comes in front of me i will beat him.

08:42.681 --> 08:47.131
This type of freedom thats
god have given to the men.

08:47.131 --> 08:51.741
It is given to you,so
you can find the Divine

08:53.691 --> 08:58.441
And in the same freedom you can
find that freedom where you are self-free.

08:58.441 --> 09:01.451
Freedom means first you
have to know your self freedom.

09:01.451 --> 09:04.519
First you have to know your
freedom because someone

09:04.544 --> 09:07.351
who does not have
freedom,what should he do next.

09:07.351 --> 09:10.151
As you study in School,they first teach you

09:10.151 --> 09:13.701
That two plus two is equal to Four.

09:13.751 --> 09:16.061
Master Took the stick
and explained this to you.

09:16.061 --> 09:20.461
When you go to college,you get freedom
to move ahead and increase your mind.

09:20.461 --> 09:25.611
In the same way,God has
also given you this freedom.

09:25.611 --> 09:30.811
Now we have given you more
freedom.Because right now you met the soul.

09:30.811 --> 09:33.561
So now you have become a Saint for us.

09:33.561 --> 09:39.071
You have grown up, become a yogi
and yogis are always worshiped here.

09:40.771 --> 09:45.521
The only difference is that earlier
yogis used to be very knowledgeable

09:45.546 --> 09:49.781
and had a lot of cleanliness and
there was very few yogis in millions.

09:50.082 --> 09:54.332
Not everyone had experience.
That they have become a yogi.

09:54.832 --> 09:56.632
This is a kind of flaw.

09:56.632 --> 10:01.142
Under this,a lot of things are stuck in us.

10:01.142 --> 10:05.392
And because of this sticky
thing,a lot of big questions arise.

10:05.392 --> 10:09.942
That's why i gave you a message
and made you understand that

10:09.942 --> 10:12.442
What is happening inside us
and what is happening outside.

10:12.442 --> 10:15.716
Those who have now
understood this thing, they

10:15.741 --> 10:18.642
can fully pay more attention to themselves

10:18.642 --> 10:22.902
And can find out what is inside
them and what is outside of them.

10:22.902 --> 10:26.202
Sahaja yoga is like a great pleasure.

10:26.202 --> 10:31.102
But this does not mean that
you get that pleasure for a second.

10:31.102 --> 10:34.362
You have to have it forever. and
for this you have to get deep into it.

10:34.612 --> 10:38.262
Now i have never talked about anything,that
you should organize something.

10:38.262 --> 10:42.562
Or i told you to do this , do
something. I never talk like that.

10:43.312 --> 10:47.112
You guys look at me. We
have seen all the slopes of life.

10:47.112 --> 10:51.972
So it is important that i want to
tell you something about this now

10:51.972 --> 10:56.772
How should we organize it ?

10:56.772 --> 11:01.572
So, absolutely we should
get down to devotion.

11:01.572 --> 11:05.582
We are human beings and we
have freedom of humen beings.

11:05.582 --> 11:11.482
And because of this sometimes
we do such things that do not

11:13.482 --> 11:15.832
suit the sahaja yogis in a way.

11:15.832 --> 11:19.942
I have a one request you that,
Whenever you have to do any

11:19.967 --> 11:23.732
work for Sahaja Yoga, our you want
to do special work for Sahaja Yoga.

11:23.732 --> 11:27.142
So i have made an Introduction.
that i will read here right now.

11:27.142 --> 11:30.292
So you can do this without asking me.

11:30.292 --> 11:34.692
Maybe you are more scholar.you
may have gained a lot knowledge.

11:34.692 --> 11:37.202
As you have a wish to work more.

11:37.202 --> 11:41.102
Maybe you go to some pundit
or them and work hard like

11:41.102 --> 11:44.752
What you have, wherever
you go the work is going to start.

11:44.752 --> 11:48.052
That's why many people say that
let's go. Ok get it done.

11:48.052 --> 11:49.412
Should not be like this.

11:49.412 --> 11:56.162
Everyone should know. put this situation in
front of whether we have to do it or not.

11:56.412 --> 11:57.612
That's all you have to do.

11:57.612 --> 12:00.594
And you don't have to
do anyting ahead of it.

12:00.619 --> 12:03.762
if they says No then No and
if they says Yes then Yes.

12:03.762 --> 12:07.022
So what will happen if they refuse,
then you can ask them there too

12:07.022 --> 12:11.422
It is our thinking. what do you
think we are doing right or wrong.

12:11.422 --> 12:14.472
So there will be a mutual understanding.

12:14.472 --> 12:18.032
So yogis should have sense
and understanding. What

12:18.057 --> 12:22.772
is good and what will increase
the name of sahajayoga.

12:22.772 --> 12:27.432
Now someone says that you dance
in the name of sahajayoga on the road.

12:27.982 --> 12:33.982
Ok dance. but not here. not in Delhi.
You can dance in Maharashtra. but not here.

12:33.982 --> 12:37.392
People here will not understand. they will
think what kind of crazy people you are.

12:37.642 --> 12:40.402
Do not behave like this here.

12:40.402 --> 12:43.047
This kind of understanding
and knowledge can all

12:43.072 --> 12:45.692
come to you if you just
look at it with emotion.

12:45.692 --> 12:47.492
Just look at with your emotion.

12:47.492 --> 12:50.492
So you can understand
what to do for Sahaja Yoga.

12:50.492 --> 12:55.119
From which things, I will increase
the name of Sahaja Yoga. How

12:55.144 --> 12:59.654
i will increase its work. And
how can I ride it inside myself?

12:59.654 --> 13:05.203
So I have thought that
our Shri Dr. Talwar and

13:05.203 --> 13:08.454
Shri Venugopalji have
done a lot of work here.

13:08.454 --> 13:11.114
And I congratulate for them for their work.

13:11.114 --> 13:14.639
the way they handled
the work till date. very

13:14.664 --> 13:18.414
hard and very wisely
they Get all the work done .

13:19.324 --> 13:24.074
And now I have thought that now some
general people should be given this work.

13:24.074 --> 13:27.316
And for that, those people
also want to be given

13:27.341 --> 13:30.624
some other work. So that
they can see more inside.

13:31.121 --> 13:38.921
So I told Dr. Sahab Whenever you
have to go out or when you give lectures

13:38.921 --> 13:45.081
After the program when people in
meditation. you also have to do meditation.

13:45.331 --> 13:48.931
Like Ram in Ramlila.

13:49.531 --> 13:55.836
The other thing is, how should one give
financial wealth and Reasonable wealth.

13:55.836 --> 13:59.831
Armor of ignorance And
freedom from crisis Must be there.

13:59.831 --> 14:04.171
And Aarti must be done. Aarti should
never be missed no matter what happens.

14:04.171 --> 14:07.471
Do not waste time in unnecessary things.

14:07.471 --> 14:11.221
Do not tell anyone about yourself.
Do not tell your experiences.

14:11.221 --> 14:16.951
If you have some experience, then write it
down and give it. We will all get Compiled.

14:16.951 --> 14:21.397
Anyone had some experience, some miracle
happened, if there was any goodness,

14:21.422 --> 14:25.451
then give it to them by writing and
also give your questions by writing.

14:25.451 --> 14:27.161
And they will be compiled.

14:27.161 --> 14:32.311
For this we will put some people ,that they
will do this work and this work.

14:32.311 --> 14:36.111
Like I heard a small thing that
electricity money was not given.

14:36.111 --> 14:39.668
Those who take the
lecture will see, they should

14:39.693 --> 14:43.371
be ready for public lecture.
They should be taught.

14:43.371 --> 14:47.321
Sir venugopalan and his wife

14:47.321 --> 14:51.971
these people.always put an
idea in my mind that we can

14:51.971 --> 14:56.731
Bring chaitanya in our country.

14:56.731 --> 15:02.971
You can bring it in the
form of skill efficiently. in the

15:02.996 --> 15:08.531
form of drama,in the form
of art, in the form of love.

15:08.531 --> 15:16.341
The second way is that, In London
they hold exhibitions in every state.

15:16.341 --> 15:22.541
In it,good pictures made by children.
good pictures made by elderly.

15:22.542 --> 15:27.452
And apart from What should we say in which

15:31.252 --> 15:34.904
What did abraham lincoln say
and what did he say, what did he say

15:34.904 --> 15:39.845
And his photograph and his
picture or his painting and What

15:39.870 --> 15:43.815
William Blade says,just like that write
and make something for Sahaja yoga.

15:43.839 --> 15:46.864
This will be a matter of
great interest in the exhibition

15:46.864 --> 15:53.365
Similarly, you can also write
your own experiences in it.

15:53.389 --> 15:56.924
You can write the special
experience you have.

15:56.924 --> 16:01.074
Or you can write any special news.

16:01.074 --> 16:03.374
Such analysis must be made.

16:03.374 --> 16:07.508
There are some such photographs
in that you know i have done a

16:07.533 --> 16:11.774
lot of miracles in it.Or you have
seen some portion of Sahstrar.

16:11.774 --> 16:15.434
There is a photo right now,
showing my complete sahstrar in it.

16:15.434 --> 16:18.984
You can keep all these types of things.

16:18.984 --> 16:23.634
Such an arrangement should be
made. This is how the people will see.

16:23.634 --> 16:25.894
This way it will be recognized visually.

16:25.894 --> 16:28.894
By ear, it will be recognized visually.

16:28.918 --> 16:31.708
And all these things
will come in front of

16:31.733 --> 16:34.693
you. So people will be
very happy to see this.

16:34.693 --> 16:36.993
You can do this kind of exhibition.

16:36.993 --> 16:44.893
There are many people here who have an
nonsensical exhibition, and many people come.

16:45.393 --> 16:48.442
So wherever there is
an exhibition, you can fill

16:48.467 --> 16:51.553
the exhibition of Sahaja
Yoga by taking the place.

16:51.553 --> 16:54.753
And it has to be prepared systematically.

16:55.263 --> 16:59.747
Then for the children, you
should also have a teacher

16:59.772 --> 17:04.480
teaching classical songs to
them and teach them. Or keep

17:04.505 --> 17:09.237
the one who is teaching
classical dance, in this way you

17:09.262 --> 17:13.911
can increase the knowledge
of art even within children.

17:14.613 --> 17:20.409
Just went to Australia, there
they made a very beautiful cup

17:20.434 --> 17:26.775
sausage of 40 itches from their
hand. they did a great job in that.

17:26.775 --> 17:31.239
By the way, we get very good
sausage in the market ,no doubt.

17:31.264 --> 17:35.085
But I get very happy seeing
things made with your hand.

17:35.135 --> 17:38.182
Something must be kept in your
ashram also That when you say that

17:38.207 --> 17:41.182
they made this thing,They made
this thing. that's make me happy.

17:41.193 --> 17:47.353
In this way women can also make many
things. they Can think. What can we do.

17:47.378 --> 17:53.193
And there are many dishes to eat
that they cook. they can think about it.

17:53.193 --> 17:56.435
And whenever we have here,
we have a cook here. I have

17:56.460 --> 17:59.466
seen everywhere. anywhere
i goes , there is a cook.

17:59.552 --> 18:03.590
And I will say that when
all of you go for a picnic Or

18:03.615 --> 18:07.402
if you go out somewhere, women
need to make food there. make it there.

18:07.402 --> 18:12.652
We are also collecting every types
of recipe that people knows to make.

18:12.652 --> 18:16.799
There is a yogi in Bombay (Mumbai)
collecting all the dishes and getting

18:16.824 --> 18:20.686
the book printed there. he also showing
me which dishes are going to printed.

18:21.161 --> 18:24.762
today,You can think many
things. Women can do many things.

18:24.762 --> 18:28.884
By doing this kind of work,
what will happen is that

18:28.909 --> 18:33.162
your doubt power will
increase, you will come together.

18:33.162 --> 18:36.105
The Sense will come
in you and if everyone

18:36.130 --> 18:37.875
works together then the
work will be done well.

18:37.875 --> 18:40.375
Be a decoration item. Or anything.

18:40.375 --> 18:43.617
We have all seen that
in foreign country they

18:43.642 --> 18:46.859
make each and
everything.They make everything

18:46.884 --> 18:49.973
by himself. They do
not bring anything from

18:49.998 --> 18:53.272
the market, all their
things are made at home.

18:53.272 --> 18:55.827
The idol of Ganpati remains
here. You can make all

18:55.852 --> 18:58.482
this. There is no need to
bring them from the market.

18:58.482 --> 19:02.741
They makes lot of things and Kept there

19:02.741 --> 19:05.294
It makes me very happy.When i see it.

19:05.294 --> 19:07.981
They have there
love In this Little Little

19:08.006 --> 19:10.792
things. and this is the
way they shows that.

19:11.742 --> 19:13.994
So now Easter is coming this year.

19:13.994 --> 19:17.992
At Easter they all send eggs there.

19:17.992 --> 19:23.495
Those eggs mean removing
everything inside the Easter

19:23.520 --> 19:29.205
egg. All of them make very
beautiful one by one with their hands.

19:29.205 --> 19:34.715
And then they makes such a
beautiful nakshi on top of so many eggs.

19:34.715 --> 19:39.265
In this way they are kept in the
ashrams. Looks very beautiful.

19:39.265 --> 19:43.315
Everyone should see how they will
advance themselves. What can we do

19:43.315 --> 19:47.075
Interacting with each other by talking
to each other is called Sahaja Yoga.

19:48.225 --> 19:52.020
They should talk about which
art to learn.Which book should

19:52.045 --> 19:55.625
you read Or which book is
good And what is written in it.

19:56.325 --> 19:59.825
There must be some presumption.
Should not remain in the same realm.

19:59.825 --> 20:05.935
It should expand and similarly men
should also know about their country.

20:05.935 --> 20:08.135
We do not know anything about our country.

20:08.135 --> 20:10.260
Mainly we do not know
anything about our country

20:10.285 --> 20:12.385
thats why We do not
love our country that much.

20:12.385 --> 20:18.185
Our country is very deep, serious
and apart from that it has infinite arts.

20:18.185 --> 20:19.685
There is infinite art.

20:19.685 --> 20:25.345
Balancing these arts, understanding
them is beyond the considered man.

20:25.345 --> 20:30.145
You should also practice it. Understanding
them closely, what happens to them.

20:30.145 --> 20:35.655
This is a very beautiful
Psychological thing we should say.

20:35.655 --> 20:38.955
And in that way you talk and speak.

20:38.955 --> 20:41.505
So our section will increase.

20:41.505 --> 20:46.155
To talk rubbish, To fight here and
there. Yogi does not have this much time.

20:46.155 --> 20:51.266
When you guys can't
do it. See i don't get time

20:51.266 --> 20:56.311
I don't know about music, you know
about picture, you know about cricket

20:56.311 --> 21:01.361
You know about western music. If
i could have time for these things.

21:01.361 --> 21:04.312
And my mind is like yours mind, It is Same.

21:04.312 --> 21:09.022
But you people should also
know like this. Should know.

21:09.022 --> 21:13.822
Now This is in our vibration.The vibration
that sounds good should be known.

21:14.122 --> 21:19.372
How did art and additionally progress
of our country. Know about the country.

21:19.372 --> 21:22.382
Some people do not know the history
of the country. Do not know anything.

21:22.382 --> 21:26.032
We live in utter darkness.
It should not happen. We

21:26.831 --> 21:29.081
Children should also be told like that.

21:29.081 --> 21:31.741
what is the training
and what is the practice.

21:31.741 --> 21:34.635
The more you know,
the more your intelligent

21:34.660 --> 21:37.245
will become.Because light will come to you.

21:37.245 --> 21:39.895
You will no longer be a normal human being.

21:39.895 --> 21:43.332
If you do not use any
machinery, then it will

21:43.357 --> 21:46.545
rust. This kind of
situation has happened.

21:46.545 --> 21:50.955
Now what we have told
Dr. Nigam Sahab that you stay here.

21:50.955 --> 21:54.073
Dr. Nigam Saheb will
be close to you and if you

21:54.098 --> 21:57.255
have any complaint or
any thing, then inform him.

21:57.255 --> 21:59.555
Whatever happens, you can tell them.

21:59.555 --> 22:04.455
And we have just made a Committee.
It is small Committee, not a very big.

22:04.455 --> 22:07.215
We just made one here

22:10.365 --> 22:11.265
Badri Prasad

22:11.265 --> 22:12.915
(Says Something In Marathi)

22:12.915 --> 22:14.665
Badri Prasad

22:19.015 --> 22:20.015
He is in.

22:20.015 --> 22:21.325
There is a Deshpande saheb.

22:24.822 --> 22:26.322
And there is one Shankarlal saheb.

22:29.222 --> 22:30.972
And there is mr. Dutta.

22:32.022 --> 22:36.522
Pradeep Soni is here for the account.

22:38.522 --> 22:42.832
And now you know that there

22:44.782 --> 22:46.532
(Take his name which is from Noida.)

22:47.282 --> 22:49.182
two gentlemen of  Noida.

22:49.183 --> 23:03.891
(Thinking and Asking there name to shishy)

23:03.891 --> 23:06.006
There name is Saubri and Hambabat.

23:10.501 --> 23:14.756
Then there should be no
quarrel among themselves.

23:15.955 --> 23:18.464
You should not show your
importance at all. Do not think

23:18.489 --> 23:21.872
that I am doing this.So
there will never be a fight.

23:22.867 --> 23:24.772
And such men people will like it.

23:24.796 --> 23:30.913
So you guys should be very understanding.If
you have any question, ask me.

23:31.161 --> 23:35.861
And nobody will work without asking.
No man has to work on his own free will.

23:35.861 --> 23:37.721
So there will be a big mess.

23:37.721 --> 23:41.626
Or we feel like something, we have
done it.And then it gets very messy.

23:41.626 --> 23:44.421
So, please pay attention to this.

23:44.421 --> 23:45.821
Whatever work is given to a man

23:46.071 --> 23:48.871
The more he wins responsibly,
the more he will benefit.

23:48.871 --> 23:51.122
And their troubles will be less.

23:51.122 --> 23:56.332
We hope that all of us will do
Sahaja Yoga with understanding and

23:58.082 --> 23:59.532
More wisely.

23:59.556 --> 24:02.181
By the way, all of you are my children

24:02.181 --> 24:04.581
And I love you all very much.

24:05.831 --> 24:08.331
And do not want to say more than this,

24:08.331 --> 24:12.341
To hurt you.

24:13.141 --> 24:15.391
But it should be understood that

24:15.391 --> 24:18.391
it is more important
to handle responsibility.

24:18.391 --> 24:19.441
And I would have

24:20.841 --> 24:25.051
meditated on you for thousands
of years and stood before them.

24:25.051 --> 24:31.101
So there could have been some other Sahaja
Yoga place. Which has very Rich people.

24:31.101 --> 24:36.401
I will stay in Delhi for a few
days and work hard on you here.

24:39.052 --> 26:15.971
Waiting for Mr.Chandrika Prasad
Srivastava (Mataji's Husband)

26:15.971 --> 27:26.621
(Welcomed from delhi with flowers )

27:26.621 --> 31:31.871
(A Sahaja Yogi gave a
speech praising both of them )

31:31.871 --> 31:41.131
(Awaiting Mr.Chandrika
Prasad Srivastava's speech)

31:50.241 --> 31:52.351
My dear Sahaja Yogis.

31:53.751 --> 31:54.751
Today is

31:56.251 --> 31:58.751
very important for me,

31:58.751 --> 32:01.051
it is also for you.

32:01.851 --> 32:04.351
But first I want to tell you that,

32:05.501 --> 32:07.151
It has been 43 years.

32:07.151 --> 32:10.651
I was married to

32:10.651 --> 32:15.451
your mother on 07-04-1947

32:22.203 --> 32:25.013
And we have been together for 43 years.

32:26.815 --> 32:28.960
And she has been watching
me and looking at herself

32:31.813 --> 32:36.323
So, first of all I want to
show my gratitude to her.

32:42.323 --> 32:48.073
Dr. Nigam Saheb said
that she should stay with me.

32:48.073 --> 32:53.933
Most of the time Husband and
wife stay together,that is fine.

32:53.933 --> 33:00.632
But you took her
time By separating us .

33:01.632 --> 33:06.085
But I want to tell you that she
can not separated from me.

33:12.333 --> 33:15.643
Where does she live with
you? she lives in your heart.

33:16.645 --> 33:18.441
by the way, it is always in my heart.

33:24.903 --> 33:29.353
And she is everywhere. she is
with everyone. She is always with me.

33:30.404 --> 33:36.655
This is what Adishakti means. Full
power is everywhere with everyone.

33:41.415 --> 33:45.965
In these 43 years we did many things.

33:45.965 --> 33:49.015
Many countries we went around the world.

33:49.015 --> 33:55.122
But I want to tell you like you
are seeing her as a mother here.

33:55.122 --> 33:56.672
She is your Mother.

33:56.672 --> 33:59.072
Like that all over the world,

33:59.072 --> 34:04.958
In China, in Japan, in
Argentina, in Sydney, in

34:04.983 --> 34:10.722
Australia every were
they considered as mother.

34:17.383 --> 34:20.983
Today we are with you on
our wedding anniversary.

34:22.243 --> 34:23.493
My daughters are not here.

34:23.493 --> 34:24.743
but

34:25.894 --> 34:28.394
Today, Dr. Nigam has
given me a very big title.

34:29.694 --> 34:32.694
Perhaps I have never received or
ever received such a big title before.

34:33.344 --> 34:34.844
He called me Dad.

34:42.254 --> 34:44.904
Now how big a family has become mine.

34:44.904 --> 34:48.554
And We are with you right now.so
it's felt like i'm with my Children.

34:55.051 --> 34:56.865
You know the love of mother.

34:58.012 --> 35:01.513
But Papa's love does not
diminish.Does not happen like this.

35:09.062 --> 35:13.823
How can I show my love to you people?

35:14.872 --> 35:17.522
I just want to tell you,

35:19.172 --> 35:23.922
That Sahaja Yoga is very
much needed in the world.

35:23.922 --> 35:27.432
But science is growing everywhere,

35:27.432 --> 35:29.731
technology is increasing.

35:30.733 --> 35:35.632
A problem is occurring every
day. accident is increasing.

35:35.632 --> 35:37.892
You see how fast the airplanes are flying.

35:39.393 --> 35:42.291
Wherever they are seeing
something new is coming.

35:42.291 --> 35:43.692
Atom bomb,

35:44.692 --> 35:46.842
But in humans

35:47.992 --> 35:49.894
Does he changed ? Does he improved ?

35:49.894 --> 35:56.301
You can see that as much development
is happening.The less people look happy.

35:56.301 --> 36:00.802
Very few people i see happy
When I roam outside in foreign.

36:02.101 --> 36:03.602
Why they are not happy?

36:03.602 --> 36:08.001
They have a car, they have a freezer,
a refrigerator. what they don't have.

36:08.611 --> 36:10.611
But they are not happy.

36:11.261 --> 36:14.661
Because they don't have one thing
which is very big. Which is inward.

36:14.661 --> 36:17.563
She did not find it.They have lost it.

36:18.964 --> 36:23.614
And that is inner power. Your Power.

36:23.614 --> 36:29.225
And through Sahaja Yoga, that
power is being increased in you.

36:30.425 --> 36:33.925
And a new phase is beginning.

36:34.925 --> 36:36.225
And it is needed most.

36:36.225 --> 36:39.625
The biggest thing is important
for you that a person is good.

36:40.485 --> 36:42.985
But our country has a different problem.

36:43.635 --> 36:47.381
If we all become like this
"Like you". you're sitting.

36:47.381 --> 36:51.181
I call Sahajayogi as centers (kendr).

36:51.181 --> 36:54.084
Because they abandoning
all bad things , they only have

36:54.109 --> 36:56.831
truth, goodness and they
Come to the goodness side.

36:56.831 --> 37:00.091
If you see this kind of
people will be all around.

37:00.141 --> 37:01.891
So everything  can be improve.

37:01.891 --> 37:04.391
And nothing can improve without.

37:05.391 --> 37:08.891
Unless there is love among ourselves,if
there is no development within,

37:08.915 --> 37:12.551
Then how will we move the country forward.

37:12.551 --> 37:17.601
But what you are doing
is a very important thing.

37:17.601 --> 37:20.401
And not only for you, it is
very important for the world.

37:20.803 --> 37:25.292
I understand because not everyone
is convinced, this is happening.

37:25.301 --> 37:28.911
That too is a miracle. she went
there. Just while ago She went there

37:28.911 --> 37:32.711
After going awhile, a big miracle happened.

37:32.711 --> 37:34.761
There is one gentelman. he is very heavy.

37:34.761 --> 37:38.686
But this is some divine
power behind them. Which is

37:38.711 --> 37:42.761
bringing such a great rise
Everywhere in this kalyuga.

37:42.761 --> 37:45.011
And it is spreding all around.

37:45.821 --> 37:50.471
And my prayer to god is that to, increase
Sahaja yoga Day by Day and Night by Night.

37:50.471 --> 37:55.771
I have seen Sahajayoga when there
were very few people in london or here.
