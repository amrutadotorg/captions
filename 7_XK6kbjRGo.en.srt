1
00:03:27,127 --> 00:03:35,866
Today we have gathered here to do
the Sahastrara puja.

2
00:03:36,858 --> 00:03:44,038
Sahastrar, the word ‘sahastr’, in Sanskrit
language, means ‘one thousand’.

3
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:54,700
And there are one thousand petals
in our brain, which get enlightened.

4
00:03:54,901 --> 00:04:01,345
Of course, the doctors are quarrelling
on that point, but forget about them.

5
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:09,518
Now these petals are kept ready
for our enlightenment,

6
00:04:10,424 --> 00:04:18,479
and these are really the nerves,
one thousand nerves,

7
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:24,090
which are there for the enlightenment
of the brain.

8
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:35,807
So when the Kundalini rises, she enlightens
those one thousand nerves

9
00:04:36,008 --> 00:04:45,100
which become like a –

10
00:04:45,301 --> 00:04:57,601
as you see here, the shape of these
flames – like a petal.

11
00:04:58,426 --> 00:05:08,096
And that’s why it is called as ‘Sahastrara’
- is the centre of Sahastrara.

12
00:05:08,297 --> 00:05:16,085
In the human beings it is a very important
centre,

13
00:05:16,286 --> 00:05:23,580
because this is the only centre by which
we think

14
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:31,679
and we try to stop whatever we don’t like.

15
00:05:32,473 --> 00:05:40,143
This is the centre which reacts, reacts
in such a manner

16
00:05:40,344 --> 00:05:48,182
that, without any discretion we start
saying, ‘no’ to this, and, ‘no’ to that,

17
00:05:48,383 --> 00:05:53,664
on small things also. Like somebody might
say, “I don’t like this carpet,”

18
00:05:53,865 --> 00:05:58,661
“I don’t like this house,” “I don’t
like that.”

19
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:07,953
This language itself shows that – who
are you? First find out!

20
00:06:08,154 --> 00:06:12,868
But you cannot become yourself unless
and until this Sahastrara,

21
00:06:13,069 --> 00:06:21,947
this brain is opened out and the Kundalini
becomes one with the Paramchaitanya.

22
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:33,116
Before that, you are in complete ignorance
about what is good and what is bad.

23
00:06:33,317 --> 00:06:39,384
Whatever you think [that], for this brain,
is good, you do it.

24
00:06:39,585 --> 00:06:44,242
But whatever is really good, you do
not know,

25
00:06:44,443 --> 00:06:48,625
because you do not know the Reality.

26
00:06:49,657 --> 00:06:54,340
Now we have to understand the consciousness
that we have:

27
00:06:54,541 --> 00:07:01,134
consciousness of being alive, consciousness
of so many things we have,

28
00:07:01,335 --> 00:07:06,788
and the so-called knowledge we have
about everything.

29
00:07:07,367 --> 00:07:14,209
All that consciousness is stored near
the liver – for your information –

30
00:07:14,455 --> 00:07:17,386
by this diaphragm.

31
00:07:17,587 --> 00:07:23,113
But then, this consciousness starts rising,
higher and higher.

32
00:07:23,314 --> 00:07:27,846
Then you become aware. In the evolutionary
process,

33
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:33,100
you become aware, aware of things.

34
00:07:33,301 --> 00:07:40,639
Without going through your brain, you just
become aware. And how?

35
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:46,634
Not by thinking, not by understanding
or seeing,

36
00:07:46,835 --> 00:07:52,932
but you become aware because
your brain has now

37
00:07:53,133 --> 00:08:00,366
started working in a manner that’s very,
very sensitive.

38
00:08:00,567 --> 00:08:06,377
So you just become aware of some sort
of a fear,

39
00:08:06,578 --> 00:08:13,114
or maybe some sort of a goodness
or anything. But it goes even further.

40
00:08:13,353 --> 00:08:18,534
The growth of consciousness, which becomes
aware, goes further:

41
00:08:18,735 --> 00:08:28,747
where you start liking a person,
or disliking a person.

42
00:08:30,518 --> 00:08:35,786
But, still it’s nothing definite and sure.

43
00:08:35,987 --> 00:08:40,422
You dislike a person because he has
a particular type of a face,

44
00:08:40,623 --> 00:08:44,381
maybe eyes or maybe anything.

45
00:08:45,354 --> 00:08:52,410
Or maybe because you have known
somebody who has been very nice,

46
00:08:52,611 --> 00:08:58,738
so you start transferring that image
onto others.

47
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:06,985
With these transferred images, you can
hate or love someone.

48
00:09:07,186 --> 00:09:12,888
Then you start saying, “I hate this,
I hate that,”

49
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,138
which has no, actually, substantial
meaning.

50
00:09:18,339 --> 00:09:26,866
You hate it because, perhaps, maybe such
and such person looks like somebody.

51
00:09:27,223 --> 00:09:31,285
Now you go further with it, then you see
that, such and such person –

52
00:09:31,486 --> 00:09:35,133
now I’m not talking about things, but
about persons -

53
00:09:35,334 --> 00:09:42,946
such and such person has done this harm to me
- something positive (may mean "negative").

54
00:09:43,147 --> 00:09:49,295
So you start feeling that you should hate
that person.

55
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,646
Now you start hating that person.
With that hatred

56
00:09:53,847 --> 00:09:58,261
you develop new faculties [of] how to harm
that person.

57
00:09:58,462 --> 00:10:02,708
Then you start thinking how to destroy
that person,

58
00:10:02,909 --> 00:10:08,288
how to make his life miserable.

59
00:10:08,489 --> 00:10:14,219
Then you may beat that person, you may
shout at that person,

60
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:18,497
you may try to kill that person. You can
do anything.

61
00:10:18,698 --> 00:10:24,071
So now the awareness is going towards
another direction, which is darkness,

62
00:10:24,272 --> 00:10:29,907
which is not light, because in the light
you won’t do such a thing.

63
00:10:30,108 --> 00:10:35,985
In the light you see everybody, everybody
is sitting, you know how far you are,

64
00:10:36,186 --> 00:10:41,227
where you are sitting. If you want to go
out, you know how to walk out.

65
00:10:41,428 --> 00:10:46,238
But when, in the darkness you are there,
you just don’t understand

66
00:10:46,439 --> 00:10:54,178
and you go on behaving in a manner
which is, which cannot be explained

67
00:10:54,379 --> 00:10:58,581
otherwise, except that, because you are
a human being.

68
00:10:58,782 --> 00:11:03,829
Animals don’t do like that. Animals have
limitation [on them].

69
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:10,820
The animals, if they find something wrong,
something absolutely

70
00:11:11,027 --> 00:11:15,962
harmful done to them, then they will attack
or run away,

71
00:11:16,163 --> 00:11:21,184
but they do not carry a kind of a hatred
or anything.

72
00:11:21,385 --> 00:11:25,907
But they can carry the impression of fear,
could be,

73
00:11:26,108 --> 00:11:32,179
of some sort of a harm done to them.
But human beings are not like that.

74
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:41,728
Human beings don’t have any particular
reason, as such, to hate someone.

75
00:11:41,929 --> 00:11:48,664
But why it works out? Because they are
involved in their ego.

76
00:11:48,865 --> 00:11:58,208
Egoistical person feels that he has a right
to do what he wants to do:

77
00:11:58,441 --> 00:12:05,246
he can kill anybody, he can bomb anyone,
he can do whatever he likes.

78
00:12:06,135 --> 00:12:11,647
But a person who is not doing that,
is the other way round:

79
00:12:11,848 --> 00:12:16,689
he is frightened, he is afraid of someone.

80
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:21,684
Now the awareness moves on. This is
a subtler awareness,

81
00:12:21,885 --> 00:12:28,730
because, if you are afraid of somebody,
you would not like to go to his house,

82
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:34,409
you will avoid him in the street,
all things you can do.

83
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:39,111
So all this kind of knowledge about other
human beings also

84
00:12:39,312 --> 00:12:42,788
accumulates in your mind.

85
00:12:42,989 --> 00:12:52,139
Then this thing starts working on
a collective level,

86
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:56,801
because you think, “This group is very bad.
They are good.

87
00:12:57,002 --> 00:13:01,825
These are bad. They are excellent!”
like that, it works out.

88
00:13:02,026 --> 00:13:08,761
In your own mind you think that somebody
has a group,

89
00:13:08,962 --> 00:13:13,318
and the other group is better or that group
is better.

90
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:23,379
And collectively, then, you start working
out your whole temperament, your awareness.

91
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:27,623
Like once people decide that say,
for example,

92
00:13:27,824 --> 00:13:35,642
that black people are to be finished,
so all the white people can join together.

93
00:13:35,843 --> 00:13:43,827
Or like at the time of Hitler, he decided
that all other human beings but Germans

94
00:13:44,028 --> 00:13:49,229
were useless. So he gathered people around
his thought and ideas.

95
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:54,350
And this collective awareness just
comes to,

96
00:13:54,551 --> 00:13:58,569
I don’t know how, but it enters into
the minds of many.

97
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:04,219
They never challenge it, they never ask
[about] it, whether it is correct or not.

98
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:11,045
So this grows more and more and more,
and then it becomes like a –

99
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:17,718
country-wise, you can say – an awareness
of this kind of a feeling.

100
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:27,461
But whether it is correct or not is not
understood, is not known.

101
00:14:27,662 --> 00:14:33,105
So, what is important [is] that you should
know Reality,

102
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:37,926
you should know exactly what is right
and what is wrong.

103
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:48,063
For that, as I told you, there is this
great power of Kundalini within you.

104
00:14:48,618 --> 00:14:51,752
She is the one, She passes through
all these centres,

105
00:14:51,953 --> 00:14:58,198
enlightens them first of all, so your
awareness gets enlightened.

106
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:03,843
And when She pierces through Sahastrara,
She joins you

107
00:15:04,044 --> 00:15:12,319
to this All-pervading Power which is
Knowledge,

108
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:20,444
which is love, which is Truth.

109
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:26,252
So, after that, you immediately know –

110
00:15:26,909 --> 00:15:31,074
some people don’t know immediately,
but some people do –

111
00:15:31,275 --> 00:15:40,074
that what we have been thinking so far,
of separating ourselves from others

112
00:15:40,275 --> 00:15:44,227
by thinking they are not all right, they are
wrong, they are whatever it is –

113
00:15:44,428 --> 00:15:48,505
this disappears. This disappears
completely,

114
00:15:48,706 --> 00:15:52,458
and then you realise that your awareness
itself,

115
00:15:52,664 --> 00:15:58,095
awareness itself is dominated by so many
other circumstances.

116
00:15:58,296 --> 00:16:02,302
For example, where you were born, what
your parents taught you,

117
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:05,399
what experiences you have had.

118
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,628
And then you realise that it was all wrong,
because it’s not Reality.

119
00:16:10,829 --> 00:16:16,124
Whatever feelings you have, whatever
ideas you have

120
00:16:16,325 --> 00:16:23,584
about another person or about other nation,
all of them are not correct.

121
00:16:23,785 --> 00:16:31,642
Because now your Sahastrara is awakened,
that it is connected now

122
00:16:31,843 --> 00:16:38,328
to the All-pervading Power. So this
starts flowing into you.

123
00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:47,579
This - I should say - enlightened awareness,
it starts flowing down into your being,

124
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:55,819
in your brain, and then on your nerves
you can feel that awareness.

125
00:16:56,020 --> 00:17:02,197
Now once you want to know about something,
whether it is right or wrong –

126
00:17:02,398 --> 00:17:06,015
absolute right and wrong, it’s not [a]
question of relative –

127
00:17:06,216 --> 00:17:11,069
you just have to put your hands towards
that person,

128
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:14,259
or towards that thing or whatever it is:

129
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:19,039
immediately on these vibrations you
will know.

130
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:23,967
So what are these vibrations, is this
Paramachaitanya,

131
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:31,054
we call it ‘Brahmachaitanya’, which starts
flowing through your finger tips.

132
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:36,194
Now you start feeling what chakras
they are catching,

133
00:17:36,395 --> 00:17:43,658
whether they are right or wrong, and your
discretion improves immensely.

134
00:17:43,859 --> 00:17:47,581
The brain, which was putting you
in delusions

135
00:17:47,782 --> 00:17:52,444
and wrong type of life, immediately
corrects itself.

136
00:17:52,645 --> 00:17:58,132
For example, I’m walking in a place
with my eyes closed,

137
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:05,017
and there is a big ditch. I can’t see it,
I’m just walking.

138
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:08,461
And suddenly I open my eyes and see
the ditch:

139
00:18:08,662 --> 00:18:12,587
immediately I know it’s wrong and I give up
and come away.

140
00:18:12,788 --> 00:18:18,618
In the same way it happens to you when
your Sahastrara is enlightened.

141
00:18:18,819 --> 00:18:24,675
Whatever you had gathered, knowledge,
whatever you think was right,

142
00:18:24,876 --> 00:18:30,325
whatever was your dream and your aims
of life, all these aspirations,

143
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:33,055
they melt away.

144
00:18:33,256 --> 00:18:40,187
And then you take to reality and you start
seeing the reality of everything.

145
00:18:40,388 --> 00:18:48,785
Unless and until you see that reality, you
will be going with [the] other crowd:

146
00:18:48,986 --> 00:18:51,315
“These people are saying so, so let’s
do that.”

147
00:18:51,516 --> 00:18:56,810
“They are saying so, so let’s do that”.
But you cannot see whether it is correct

148
00:18:57,011 --> 00:19:03,117
or not, it’s good for you or not, or
whether it is going to help you.

149
00:19:03,318 --> 00:19:09,311
This kind of thing is so common
in the whole world

150
00:19:09,512 --> 00:19:16,208
and that’s why there is so much problem.
Because they don’t know the reality.

151
00:19:16,409 --> 00:19:21,013
Once you know the reality, most of
the problems can be finished,

152
00:19:21,214 --> 00:19:25,012
because this brain itself is creating
problems.

153
00:19:25,213 --> 00:19:31,206
First of all, it commits all kinds
of atrocities, violence, everything;

154
00:19:31,407 --> 00:19:37,342
then it also justifies itself, and then
it does even worse things.

155
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:44,831
All this, they used to call it as ‘sin’, but
now in Sahaja Yoga, that’s finished now.

156
00:19:45,053 --> 00:19:49,854
Whatever your brain was contaminated with
is now cleansed.

157
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:54,648
It has got the knowledge and through
the knowledge you can make out

158
00:19:54,849 --> 00:19:59,916
what is right and what is wrong.
Up to this point is all right.

159
00:20:00,117 --> 00:20:08,847
But then you must have full understanding
that, whatever [is] right, is right,

160
00:20:09,048 --> 00:20:15,108
and whatever [is] wrong is wrong, and we
should not do anything that is wrong,

161
00:20:15,309 --> 00:20:21,109
always do the right. You have to decide
on that point.

162
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:26,435
”Now we have to do the right only,
never the wrong”.

163
00:20:26,636 --> 00:20:31,826
This, when it comes to your mind, then
what starts is your determination:

164
00:20:32,027 --> 00:20:37,606
what we call as devotion, dedication,
surrendering.

165
00:20:39,849 --> 00:20:47,924
With that, you give up all your false ideas
and all your false pride,

166
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:51,007
all other things that you have been doing
so far,

167
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:57,396
and immediately you become a different
person, a beautiful person.

168
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:06,059
Now the third thing that happens to you,
which never happened to you before,

169
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:13,481
[is] that you feel that: “Unless and until
I give the same state to other people

170
00:21:13,682 --> 00:21:19,970
it won’t be all right, it won’t be -
all right for me to talk to them”.

171
00:21:20,171 --> 00:21:23,508
So you start talking to your brothers,
sisters.

172
00:21:23,709 --> 00:21:28,378
Then you start talking to other people,
then you start talking to...

173
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:32,172
[the] whole nation you can talk about
Sahaja Yoga,

174
00:21:32,373 --> 00:21:39,697
that, “I have gained so much, I have got
these things; so now, why not you take it?”

175
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:43,417
But to expect that by talking,
by discussion,

176
00:21:43,618 --> 00:21:48,131
by arguments, by sermoning…
they will never take.

177
00:21:48,332 --> 00:21:56,039
Because their brain, as I told you, is just
the same - still full of ignorance.

178
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,891
So what you have to do is to raise
their Kundalini.

179
00:22:00,092 --> 00:22:04,996
Once you raise their Kundalini and their
brain opens,

180
00:22:05,197 --> 00:22:11,190
then they are on the same line as yourself.
They don’t have to worry

181
00:22:11,391 --> 00:22:19,581
about what is good and what is bad,
they know [it] themselves.

182
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:29,176
Now that is what is very important.
To correct this world is very important:

183
00:22:29,377 --> 00:22:33,708
that you all should know what is right
and what is wrong.

184
00:22:33,909 --> 00:22:41,248
And you have a vehicle of Paramachaitanya
to know what is wrong and what is right.

185
00:22:41,449 --> 00:22:46,272
Now this strength starts moving and,
as you see, there are

186
00:22:46,473 --> 00:22:51,047
so many people, today, with their open
Sahastrara.

187
00:22:51,248 --> 00:22:57,715
So opening Sahastrara was the most
important part of the evolutionary process.

188
00:22:57,916 --> 00:23:03,080
All the evolution process brought human
beings to what level?

189
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:11,130
We had wars, we had all kinds of silly
programmes

190
00:23:11,376 --> 00:23:17,906
by which we really ruined so many
countries, so many people.

191
00:23:18,649 --> 00:23:26,629
Now when you are one with that
All-pervading Power: It’s a pure power.

192
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:32,675
It’s a nirmal power. Absolutely pure
power.

193
00:23:32,876 --> 00:23:38,662
That gives you complete sense and complete
understanding

194
00:23:38,863 --> 00:23:46,842
as to how you should move, how you should
live, and what you should have.

195
00:23:47,179 --> 00:23:51,759
This is what is Self-realisation, they say.

196
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:57,940
But I would say that Self-realisation is
much further than that.

197
00:23:58,141 --> 00:24:05,269
Even if your brain is enriched by
the Knowledge, the Real Knowledge,

198
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:09,678
still there are other things which you
should have.

199
00:24:09,879 --> 00:24:15,854
And the most important thing is that
you have to be

200
00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:21,536
completely aware – again I say word
‘aware’ –

201
00:24:21,737 --> 00:24:31,206
of where you stand in this big plan
of world global transformation.

202
00:24:31,407 --> 00:24:35,927
What is your position? What are you
supposed to do

203
00:24:36,128 --> 00:24:42,750
for this global transformation? What is
your position?

204
00:24:42,964 --> 00:24:49,644
Where do you stand? What is the work
for you to be done?

205
00:24:49,845 --> 00:24:57,725
Now you’ve got this compulsion on you,
that, “I have to do something.”

206
00:24:57,926 --> 00:25:03,918
When this compulsion starts working
on you, which is not dreadful,

207
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:11,609
which is not annoying, but very peaceful
and joyful,

208
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:17,747
which says that, “I have to see that others
also know themselves!”

209
00:25:17,948 --> 00:25:24,019
So to know themselves is, first of all
you must know your own chakras.

210
00:25:24,694 --> 00:25:30,047
Yes, many people get their Realisation,
I know, very quickly.

211
00:25:30,248 --> 00:25:34,408
But they do not settle down with
their chakras.

212
00:25:34,609 --> 00:25:39,088
They have to see to their chakras: why you
have problems on your chakras.

213
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:42,961
They will know they have problems,
but they still go on

214
00:25:43,162 --> 00:25:47,834
without paying attention or without looking
at it.

215
00:25:48,035 --> 00:25:52,369
To them it is a kind of a

216
00:25:55,136 --> 00:26:01,000
by the way [style], you can say: that,
“These problems are with me doesn’t matter.

217
00:26:01,201 --> 00:26:08,279
But what does it matter as long as I am
working out Sahaja Yoga?”

218
00:26:08,465 --> 00:26:12,918
It is not only for others, but for yourself
also!

219
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:18,152
Is important that you should get your
chakras corrected.

220
00:26:18,353 --> 00:26:23,516
That’s the most important thing for you,
and then you will have Self-knowledge,

221
00:26:23,717 --> 00:26:27,643
in the sense [that] you will know what is
the defect, where is the defect,

222
00:26:27,844 --> 00:26:34,040
”What am I doing wrong? What should I do?”
And then when you correct it,

223
00:26:34,241 --> 00:26:38,434
when you correct those centres, then
your awareness,

224
00:26:38,635 --> 00:26:43,359
I would say, will be really, fully
enlightened about all the world.

225
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,917
Now, it’s a tremendous thing – it’s very
tremendous.

226
00:26:47,118 --> 00:26:52,590
Because if you have to transform this mad
world into something very sane,

227
00:26:52,791 --> 00:26:57,121
and if we have to give them all
Self-realisation,

228
00:26:57,322 --> 00:27:03,227
imagine the task, how great it is, how many
people we need to do it.

229
00:27:03,404 --> 00:27:11,012
But if your willpower is strong about it
and you see – you feel compelled to do it.

230
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:16,144
But normally, you see, we are compelled
because we have to run our houses,

231
00:27:16,345 --> 00:27:20,797
we have to earn money, we have to do this,
we have to do that.

232
00:27:20,998 --> 00:27:28,241
That you can do. But main object of your
life is to transform people

233
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:36,266
and to work it out, this transformation –
for the global peace.

234
00:27:36,467 --> 00:27:40,403
I don’t know [if] it has been predicted
or not,

235
00:27:40,604 --> 00:27:43,703
that a complete transformation will take
place,

236
00:27:43,904 --> 00:27:48,503
but they have talked about transformation.
I don’t know that part,

237
00:27:48,704 --> 00:27:55,025
and I just don’t bother my head as to how
many people are getting transformed.

238
00:27:55,226 --> 00:28:00,420
But after transformation you must settle
down.

239
00:28:00,621 --> 00:28:05,572
First of all you should see if you are
a peaceful person,

240
00:28:05,732 --> 00:28:10,393
if there’s peace in your heart.
If you have no peace in your heart

241
00:28:10,594 --> 00:28:15,407
then you are not a Sahaja Yogi.
If you get excited

242
00:28:15,608 --> 00:28:22,115
and if you start shouting at people and all
that, it means you are not Sahaja Yogis.

243
00:28:22,316 --> 00:28:28,869
You have to have a very, very peaceful
temperament, that is very important.

244
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:34,881
Now with that peace what should be there,
[is] pure compassion.

245
00:28:36,809 --> 00:28:42,581
What you are doing is not for your benefit
or as such,

246
00:28:42,782 --> 00:28:52,157
but because you are compelled by this Force
to do good for others, to transform them.

247
00:28:52,358 --> 00:28:57,788
This is the greatest good you can do
to others, that their brains are put right,

248
00:28:57,989 --> 00:29:02,667
they get rid of their diseases, they get
rid of their problems. It’s all there.

249
00:29:02,868 --> 00:29:07,670
But, the first thing and the most important
thing that happens

250
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:11,327
[is] that they get the power to transform
others.

251
00:29:11,528 --> 00:29:17,703
When you have that power to transform
others you should not waste it,

252
00:29:17,904 --> 00:29:22,601
you should not use it for yourself. That
means the growth is not complete.

253
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:29,420
You must talk about it, you must tell
about it, and you must work it out.

254
00:29:29,621 --> 00:29:33,194
Wherever it is possible you have to work
it out.

255
00:29:33,395 --> 00:29:38,845
This is the way we can spread people
on a global level,

256
00:29:39,046 --> 00:29:42,369
who can get complete transformation.

257
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:48,077
All our problems, whether in India
or anywhere,

258
00:29:48,278 --> 00:29:57,184
is because of human beings, because they
have been not enlightened.

259
00:29:57,385 --> 00:30:02,981
See, if you are enlightened you’ll have
no problem of any quarrelling

260
00:30:03,182 --> 00:30:06,629
or any fighting and all that.

261
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:13,555
If you are enlightened, then you will think
about others,

262
00:30:13,756 --> 00:30:18,968
others as if they are your own, bother
your heads about them.

263
00:30:19,169 --> 00:30:23,705
You will not think about yourself anymore.

264
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:30,029
If you are enlightened then [there's]
no question of any violence in your head.

265
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:33,920
Nowadays in the name of religion,
in the name of everything,

266
00:30:34,121 --> 00:30:36,469
there is so much of violence.

267
00:30:36,692 --> 00:30:41,859
This violence can be easily corrected
if they all become Sahaja Yogis.

268
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:47,319
Think, if all people become Sahaja Yogis,
how will they quarrel, for what?

269
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,382
So this religion is there, but above
all these religions

270
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:56,288
is the religion of Sahaja Yoga, where
you become one.

271
00:30:56,489 --> 00:31:01,184
And there all these quarrels of religions
will disappear.

272
00:31:01,773 --> 00:31:04,770
This is not the only problem we have
as human beings,

273
00:31:04,971 --> 00:31:08,377
we have some other problems also,
very serious.

274
00:31:08,578 --> 00:31:16,302
That is, we have a hankering.

275
00:31:17,033 --> 00:31:22,789
We are very greedy. We cannot adjust
yourself to any other circumstances.

276
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:26,958
We want to live in complete comfort and
this and that.

277
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:32,639
But after this you can sleep anywhere, you
can eat anywhere, you need not eat.

278
00:31:32,818 --> 00:31:42,838
You become a person who is above all these
needs, all these demands, absolutely.

279
00:31:56,894 --> 00:32:02,470
Then you don’t worry, you don’t worry.
There’s worry for what?

280
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:06,963
Supposing I get lost somewhere and the car
is going in a wrong way:

281
00:32:07,164 --> 00:32:11,527
all right, I have to go that way,
that’s why I’m going like that.

282
00:32:11,728 --> 00:32:14,479
What is there to feel upset about it?

283
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:21,664
So many things, small, big, happen in your
life for which you get upset.

284
00:32:21,865 --> 00:32:26,324
But now, with this blessing of Sahastrara,

285
00:32:26,525 --> 00:32:32,558
you’ll be amazed, there is help
from Paramchaitanya.

286
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:41,662
And that means a tremendous help, because
it acts globally, it acts individually,

287
00:32:41,863 --> 00:32:48,770
it acts on communities, it acts on nations,

288
00:32:48,971 --> 00:32:58,019
because there is a Divine – what we call
‘Divine’ – where is a Divine play going on.

289
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:03,601
And this Divine play plays tremendous
beautiful things,

290
00:33:03,802 --> 00:33:08,085
by which people start correcting
themselves.

291
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:11,634
So, you should never be nervous, you should
never be upset,

292
00:33:11,835 --> 00:33:16,929
because you have the Divine Power
within you, and it will correct.

293
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:22,958
It can correct anyone. I mean, recently
we had a case of one boy

294
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:28,731
who was hit by a truck and they said
his lungs were smashed.

295
00:33:28,932 --> 00:33:33,509
Now, with the lungs smashed, nobody has
heard that they become normal.

296
00:33:33,715 --> 00:33:37,292
Not only they became normal, but he started
breathing normally.

297
00:33:37,493 --> 00:33:43,564
And now he is all right. Is only this work
is done by Paramchaitanya.

298
00:33:43,765 --> 00:33:48,054
You don’t have to do anything. Any problem
comes before you,

299
00:33:48,255 --> 00:33:54,840
before it really touches you, is solved
by the Paramchaitanya.

300
00:33:55,602 --> 00:34:02,621
But you must have full faith in yourself
and in Paramachaitanya

301
00:34:02,822 --> 00:34:08,223
and believe that you are a realised-soul.
Nobody can harm you.

302
00:34:08,424 --> 00:34:12,858
If they try to harm you, for the time
being, all right, you may suffer,

303
00:34:13,059 --> 00:34:18,053
but you don’t also feel the sufferings
and you get out of it.

304
00:34:18,254 --> 00:34:24,655
Such a security, such a proper guidance
is there.

305
00:34:24,856 --> 00:34:28,884
Also you are saved from all kinds
of attacks

306
00:34:29,085 --> 00:34:33,530
and all kinds of mistakes that you commit.

307
00:34:33,731 --> 00:34:41,021
It’s all such a big – I would say,
a Computer of Knowledge.

308
00:34:41,222 --> 00:34:48,077
He knows, It knows what you are doing
and what you should not do,

309
00:34:48,278 --> 00:34:54,012
where you are going and what should
not be your way.

310
00:34:54,213 --> 00:35:00,503
He knows, It knows everything, knows
everything about you.

311
00:35:00,704 --> 00:35:06,048
So then you have to become aware of It.

312
00:35:06,249 --> 00:35:10,693
Now this is the stage where I would say
that you have to be aware

313
00:35:10,894 --> 00:35:18,483
that you are realised-souls, you are
different,

314
00:35:18,684 --> 00:35:24,162
very unique. You are realised-souls,
you are not ordinary people.

315
00:35:24,363 --> 00:35:34,140
And that you are protected by this
Paramchaitanya. Nothing can change you,

316
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:41,690
nothing can trouble you, nothing can
overpower you.

317
00:35:41,891 --> 00:35:46,953
Because you are not aware, also, of this
Paramachaitanya,

318
00:35:47,154 --> 00:35:50,938
that’s why you, a little bit, get worried.
And people write to me,

319
00:35:51,139 --> 00:35:55,182
“Mother, my - something wrong with
my daughter, something this thing."

320
00:35:55,383 --> 00:36:01,062
Everything can be corrected
by Paramchaitanya,

321
00:36:01,263 --> 00:36:05,312
if you know how to leave it to That,

322
00:36:06,129 --> 00:36:11,265
if you understand how you are one
with that Paramchaitanya,

323
00:36:11,466 --> 00:36:19,722
you are a part and parcel of that. And that
Paramchaitanya is looking after you.

324
00:36:19,923 --> 00:36:24,640
You don’t have [a] very conscious effort,

325
00:36:24,841 --> 00:36:30,659
there’s no need to have very conscious
effort. Accept life as it is.

326
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:35,064
As it is, whatever life is there, accept.
Don’t retaliate,

327
00:36:35,265 --> 00:36:38,848
don’t get angry, don’t get upset.
Just accept.

328
00:36:39,049 --> 00:36:43,905
And you’ll enjoy the same life which
was irritating you!

329
00:36:44,106 --> 00:36:50,118
You will see the enjoying part of that,
and it will be so beautiful

330
00:36:50,319 --> 00:36:54,675
the way you will see that you’ll get over
all your problems,

331
00:36:54,876 --> 00:36:57,408
you’ll get over all your enemies.

332
00:36:57,609 --> 00:37:04,988
And a kind of a very fresh, beautiful
existence you’ll have.

333
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:12,310
So now, as you are all Sahaja Yogis,
is a very great position.

334
00:37:12,511 --> 00:37:19,950
With that, if you humble down, humble down,
then you’ll be amazed to see

335
00:37:20,151 --> 00:37:27,259
that, you are absolutely in contact with
this Paramchaitanya;

336
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:32,086
not only that, but you have become
Paramchaitanya.

337
00:37:35,051 --> 00:37:39,584
With this Paramchaitanya you can do
anything.

338
00:37:39,785 --> 00:37:46,100
I need not tell you what you can do,
because some of you may not believe.

339
00:37:46,301 --> 00:37:52,183
But that’s [what] my own experience is,
that, if you are the Paramchaitanya,

340
00:37:52,384 --> 00:37:57,668
if you know you are the Paramchaitanya,
then it keeps your dignity,

341
00:37:57,869 --> 00:38:04,079
it keeps your position, it keeps your world
and looks after you.

342
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:09,421
And whatever is just said or desired,
you just get it.

343
00:38:09,622 --> 00:38:15,534
Your desires also change. Your desires
are not for stupid things,

344
00:38:15,735 --> 00:38:20,344
but for something that is very noble.

345
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:27,353
Like, you want to transform people, you
want to do Sahaja Yoga work.

346
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:31,598
All these desires are fulfilled fully,

347
00:38:31,799 --> 00:38:37,892
when you want to do it, you like it and
you think of it.

348
00:38:38,093 --> 00:38:42,028
It is something, even seeing something:

349
00:38:42,229 --> 00:38:46,696
if you see something and you are stunned
by that!

350
00:38:46,897 --> 00:38:55,732
Immediately Paramchaitanya will take over
and you will have no problems, no problems.

351
00:38:55,933 --> 00:39:04,178
Because the way we react to all these
difficulties and to so-called odds in life

352
00:39:04,379 --> 00:39:07,602
becomes a play, just a play.
You are amazed!

353
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:11,979
You looked at it and finished!
Look at that, and finished!

354
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:19,928
That is how it is the light, which goes into
the darkness and finishes the darkness.

355
00:39:20,129 --> 00:39:24,799
The darkness is finished, and our problems
are finished also.

356
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,552
So this is what is our awareness has
to become.

357
00:39:28,753 --> 00:39:32,383
Awareness has to become Paramachaitanya.

358
00:39:32,584 --> 00:39:37,764
Then you get all the ideas, everything
that are Divine.

359
00:39:37,965 --> 00:39:45,457
But not only that, but also the help of
the Divine, all the solutions of the Divine.

360
00:39:45,658 --> 00:39:50,588
It’s something amazing! And everything
quietens down,

361
00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:57,097
everything settles down, and you are
amazed, watching all this,

362
00:39:57,298 --> 00:40:03,126
that you are the centre of doing
all these things.

363
00:40:03,327 --> 00:40:06,979
You are not aware that you are doing,
and you are this.

364
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:11,651
That ego part is missing. But you
see it’s all happening around you,

365
00:40:11,852 --> 00:40:16,504
and then you are amazed how it is
happening.

366
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:22,324
The whole lifestyle changes, the whole
understanding changes,

367
00:40:22,525 --> 00:40:29,008
and you become a great source of happiness,
joy and knowledge to others.

368
00:40:29,209 --> 00:40:35,474
You don’t have to study anything, you don’t
have to know much,

369
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:41,803
but you will know about everything,
what is right and what is wrong.

370
00:40:42,954 --> 00:40:48,701
And then only you can tell the things
with complete authority

371
00:40:48,902 --> 00:40:54,235
that, “This is not right!” Like today,
we had a discussion on this point

372
00:40:54,436 --> 00:40:59,230
about the economic position and
the economics of modern times.

373
00:40:59,431 --> 00:41:07,057
I said, “Is all wrong, because it is
self-destructive.”

374
00:41:07,258 --> 00:41:13,732
It destroys the nations, if not your
nation, other nations.

375
00:41:13,933 --> 00:41:23,037
Then it also destroys your family life.
It destroys your value system.

376
00:41:23,238 --> 00:41:30,484
It completely destroys you. So what sort
of an economics is this?

377
00:41:30,685 --> 00:41:41,618
It’s just a show, just a, like a, you can
say, a balloon: it can burst any moment.

378
00:41:41,819 --> 00:41:45,159
I have seen people who are very rich,
very this thing,

379
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:50,763
think no end of themselves [then] become
bankrupt. And very bankrupt become rich.

380
00:41:50,964 --> 00:41:57,703
So it’s [a] kind of a turmoil in which
they are jumping,

381
00:41:57,904 --> 00:42:03,987
from one shore to another shore. But
you are not. You watch that drama.

382
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:10,619
You see all that drama, and with your peace
you can see everything, very calmly.

383
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:15,020
Not, it’s not difficult for you to create
more people like this.

384
00:42:15,221 --> 00:42:21,760
It’s not difficult to transform this world.
The time has come, just ripe time.

385
00:42:21,961 --> 00:42:26,210
Like when the proper time comes,
the blossom time comes,

386
00:42:26,411 --> 00:42:31,823
so many flowers become fruits. So,
like that, you all have become.

387
00:42:32,024 --> 00:42:37,259
Now it is for you to create seeds to spread
Sahaja Yoga.

388
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:42,600
You are at that level of awareness now
where Paramchaitanya is with you,

389
00:42:42,801 --> 00:42:48,763
absolutely part and parcel of you,
absolutely with you to give you

390
00:42:48,964 --> 00:42:57,924
all necessary help, all necessary prestige,
and also the personality.

391
00:42:59,637 --> 00:43:02,443
May God bless you all.
