00:00:02.491 --> 00:00:09.410
They have advertised that Mataji is going
to grant me Self-realization.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:18.170
It's too much to bear - think that
somebody can grant you Self-realization..

00:00:18.582 --> 00:00:24.320
Then I told them you should not have written
such grand things because after all

00:00:24.895 --> 00:00:31.295
see, it hurts people to think that,
somebody who looks like us, lives like us,

00:00:31.398 --> 00:00:39.158
has been entitled to grant us Self-realization.
I must say, that was a mistake on their part.

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:46.219
I didn't say that I'm going to grant,
neither am I saying it is granted

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.720
but I would say that it could be manifested.
Let us talk in the third person.

00:00:52.796 --> 00:00:57.646
Would be a better idea to talk about the
third person first of all that

00:00:57.646 --> 00:01:08.767
Truth would be manifested. That is The
thing we could ask for. That is the only

00:01:08.767 --> 00:01:14.804
thing that is lacking in human being,
is Self-knowledge otherwise you have

00:01:14.804 --> 00:01:21.265
sorted everything out. As far as the
matter is concerned, you have sorted out.

00:01:21.273 --> 00:01:25.183
You have gone up to the moon, you've
gone up to, I don't know, Sun - I know

00:01:25.183 --> 00:01:29.840
you've not yet done that but you are
using the Sun's rays, everything material

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.635
that is given to you, has been sorted out
up to the microscopic level.

00:01:38.624 --> 00:01:44.374
Into emotional side you have gone to other
extremes. You have gone into the emotional

00:01:44.374 --> 00:01:49.870
side to such an extent that sometimes
shudder to see that how people have ruined

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.297
themselves completely running after
emotional experience.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.218
Then into rationality, when I see
human-beings, they have rationally

00:02:00.218 --> 00:02:07.300
sorted out many things and in
that you have committed such mistakes,

00:02:07.866 --> 00:02:14.256
that it is impossible to convince you that
they are absolutely false ideas.

00:02:15.396 --> 00:02:22.676
Because through rationality you cannot
reach God, which is a Eternal Being

00:02:22.676 --> 00:02:29.300
or you can say, an is an Unlimited Being;
You cannot reach an Unlimited Being by

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:35.698
your limited styles. Anything you do, you
cannot do that. Somebody has to trigger it

00:02:35.698 --> 00:02:43.472
or you are to be triggered. So, through
rationality you cannot reach that stage

00:02:44.222 --> 00:02:51.102
where Christ has asked you to reach, about
which Shri Krishna has described that

00:02:51.102 --> 00:02:56.128
'Atmanyne atmane tushta' - you have to
know your Atma, your Spirit; You cannot

00:02:56.128 --> 00:03:03.618
know it by reading about it. Like Shankaracharya
has said, "Na yoge na Saankhye,"

00:03:03.618 --> 00:03:09.828
by any of these things you cannot - by Saankhya,
by yoga - these exercises and all that

00:03:09.828 --> 00:03:16.344
you cannot know - only through the Grace.
Only through the Grace of God you can know

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:26.997
and this is one simple thing which we
accept within ourselves that I call, is

00:03:26.997 --> 00:03:33.467
the humility of man that we cannot know by
ourselves because in the evolution so far,

00:03:33.467 --> 00:03:41.627
we have done nothing to be human-beings.
You have become human-beings by yourself.

00:03:42.512 --> 00:03:49.702
Self, which Self you do not know, which is
the Kshetragya, as is called by Shri Krishna,

00:03:49.702 --> 00:03:55.858
is the One Who knows the field where it is
working. It works out but you do not know

00:03:55.858 --> 00:04:02.466
how it works out but you know Somebody who
knows; You are aware of that within yourself

00:04:02.804 --> 00:04:11.864
but the connection is not been yet established.
So, when we talk of Self-realization,

00:04:12.854 --> 00:04:21.854
rationality plays it's own part up to a
point. Everything has played it's place,

00:04:22.251 --> 00:04:32.831
it's role, help to bring you to that point
where now the time has come for you to know.

00:04:33.355 --> 00:04:41.085
Even Science, if you go to the extreme of
Science, you find it's not there - no, it's not there.

00:04:41.927 --> 00:04:49.217
It's finished, it's not there, so you come
back. Even spiritual seeking, so called,

00:04:49.807 --> 00:04:54.737
has fixed - they've done this,
they've done that. Have you found it? No.

00:04:55.396 --> 00:05:01.466
That should be there. If this denial is
not there, Sahaja yoga doesn't work out.

00:05:01.741 --> 00:05:08.294
"No, we haven't found as yet," they agree,
"Mother." That's the thing which Gregoire

00:05:08.294 --> 00:05:13.150
perhaps is trying to tell you is this,
that if you say, "No, I've found it,"

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:18.996
then you better go ahead. See, the thing
is, it is such a subtle happening,

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:25.719
it is such a beautiful happening that you
don't feel anything as a pain or anything

00:05:27.407 --> 00:05:32.407
but it is a subtle happening and you will
lose the subtleness just like that

00:05:32.407 --> 00:05:36.178
like a little delicate flower when you
have to handle it, you see.

00:05:36.178 --> 00:05:40.560
When you are smelling a little flower, you
have to be attentive about it and smell it

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.567
but if you start going to the libraries and
finding out, "How should I enjoy this flower?"

00:05:47.422 --> 00:05:52.722
It's such a gross way of looking at it,
you see but it is a very subtle happening

00:05:52.722 --> 00:05:57.341
and works out better. I know My job
and My job is very simple.

00:05:58.605 --> 00:06:05.155
Is a very simple job that the light which
is enlightened, a candle that is enlightened,

00:06:05.155 --> 00:06:10.996
can enlighten other lights too. Don't
think about Me - forget it. It's My job

00:06:13.321 --> 00:06:22.521
and that's My job for which I'm born, I've
to live for it and doing it itself paid for it

00:06:23.984 --> 00:06:28.814
because we start thinking about future if
[UNCLEAR] everything. "Why this Mataji doing it?"

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:34.760
What can I do, that's My nature. Do you
ask the Sun, "Why do you shine?"

00:06:37.606 --> 00:06:43.606
In the same way, this question to Me
has no meaning - it's nature

00:06:45.767 --> 00:06:50.885
and it has to work out, the time has come.
It has worked out, now you see at least

00:06:50.885 --> 00:06:59.397
15%, I should say, 60% have felt it. All of you
should get it but Aditya had an interesting

00:07:00.394 --> 00:07:04.854
report that somebody said, "No, no we are
not interested in Self-realization, we want God."

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:14.160
What is Self-realization? It's then we
should know what is a Self?

00:07:15.723 --> 00:07:21.203
This is through rational mind we can
understand but we do not know it, we do not

00:07:21.203 --> 00:07:27.026
identify it, we do not actualize it. Unless
and until this happening takes place within you

00:07:27.026 --> 00:07:36.506
for which we are built - only by talking
about it or saying about it, you won't get it.

00:07:36.506 --> 00:07:43.649
By reading about it you won't get it;
By the happening itself only, will happen.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:49.580
Like, it's a very simple thing. Supposing,
you have a stone in the stomach, it has

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:53.769
to be removed. You have to have the operation
- isn't it? By reading about the stone,

00:07:53.769 --> 00:07:57.547
by reading about the doctor, by reading
about the medicine, by singing about it

00:07:57.547 --> 00:08:01.567
or by talking about it or by describing,
will you get it removed?

00:08:03.067 --> 00:08:07.927
Through God's Grace what happens to our
brains, I don't know. We are not so

00:08:07.927 --> 00:08:14.850
practical about it. We do not understand
that if it has to happen, it will happen

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:25.254
within us spontaneously. Self - even to
take the name of Self itself, is joy giving.

00:08:25.254 --> 00:08:34.651
What is Self - is the reflection of God
within us - is Self. The God Almighty

00:08:38.272 --> 00:08:43.852
exists or not, is another big lecture, you
see but by rationality we'll not know,

00:08:43.852 --> 00:08:50.260
with this happening we will know. So, forget
that. Put your mind to rest a little bit.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:54.824
As they said, 'Ja neti, neti vachne nigamo
[UNCLEAR]' - By saying, "No, not this."

00:08:54.839 --> 00:08:59.399
That's it, not this. Let's say, not this.
It's a very subtle happening, so I'm

00:08:59.399 --> 00:09:07.547
taking you down to that point. It is the
reflection of God Almighty into our own being

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:19.470
but we think that reflection can be perfected
through our cleansing, through our japa, tapa

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:29.808
and all those things. We can cleanse our
being by doing all kinds of punyas,

00:09:29.808 --> 00:09:34.237
as they call it, by donating things,
serving people, this, that

00:09:37.211 --> 00:09:44.571
but have you seen anybody getting Self
realization by that? You might cleanse,

00:09:46.205 --> 00:09:52.055
you may cleanse these things, you may
cleanse this but can you get a light inside?

00:09:53.275 --> 00:10:00.545
You may [UNCLEAR] cleanings, will
you get the light inside - you cannot;

00:10:00.545 --> 00:10:13.063
You have to have connection with the
mains. Supposing, you get a power by which

00:10:13.063 --> 00:10:18.214
you can see the filth and dirt - it would
be even better to get the power first and

00:10:18.214 --> 00:10:25.164
cleanse it later. How do we keep clean a glass
- have you seen that? Be practical, as I said.

00:10:25.549 --> 00:10:29.649
Even if you have to clean a glass, you
have to put it against the light.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:38.610
Can you clean a glass in darkness? Tell
Me. In the same way, you have to put it

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:43.515
against the light, you have to have the
light within you, maybe, maybe it's a

00:10:43.515 --> 00:10:47.902
blurred light in the beginning, maybe it's
not clear but there is light.

00:10:49.122 --> 00:10:55.755
So, those who think, that we are going to
clean our karmas, also must know you cannot.

00:10:58.774 --> 00:11:05.024
At the most you can keep in the center,
at the most you can lead a good, religious,

00:11:05.024 --> 00:11:11.715
righteous, holy life but your karmas that
were there, have been there in previous lives,

00:11:11.715 --> 00:11:15.285
you cannot clear it, you cannot by
doing anything.

00:11:16.165 --> 00:11:20.860
Like, we can say that this lamp is
dirty, we can maintain that much

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:28.350
but if you think you can completely
remove it's dirt in darkness, you cannot.

00:11:30.325 --> 00:11:37.935
You have to have light to see what is dirty
in it, what is the one that is obstructing;

00:11:38.996 --> 00:11:42.616
That's why light is first to be done,
whatever may be the condition.

00:11:46.049 --> 00:11:51.809
So, this house now, supposing is granted
to Me, is in the worst possible condition

00:11:51.809 --> 00:11:55.645
- you can't see anything, first thing I would
do, if there's darkness, put a light there -

00:11:55.646 --> 00:12:04.696
practical. Without the light how do I
enter in? You see - so first put the light in

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:11.170
[UNCLEAR] is there. What is Self-realization?
Is to enlighten that thing within you.

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:17.069
Some will be having flickering candle - it
will blow off, it blows on it's darkness.

00:12:17.289 --> 00:12:22.870
[UNCLEAR] Mother has too much
patience, is a [UNCLEAR]. That's one point

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:28.414
Mr. Gregoire had said himself. But why
do I have patience? Because I'm love.

00:12:29.887 --> 00:12:33.527
We cannot imagine a person who loves

00:12:34.486 --> 00:12:38.878
and loves gives you the patience. I mean,
to Me I never know that I'm patient

00:12:38.878 --> 00:12:43.589
unless and until others tell Me because
I enjoy it doing things which really

00:12:43.589 --> 00:12:50.892
gives you the light. So there is no give
and take, no hurting of ego; I'm not doing

00:12:50.892 --> 00:12:59.437
anything special for you - is My job, I'm
paid for it because I have the joy of the

00:12:59.437 --> 00:13:08.317
whole world. By doing this, I'm achieving
the greatest of greatest Myself - is the joy

00:13:08.317 --> 00:13:15.432
that you can see the light. We do not, in
this modern times, when everybody becomes

00:13:15.432 --> 00:13:22.863
utility and pennyworth, understand a person
who does something for the [UNCLEAR].

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:35.010
Now, one thing is sure that this happening
of Self-realization, has been described in

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:42.867
all the scriptures, which are real
scriptures, say Gita, say Koran, say Bible -

00:13:43.356 --> 00:13:50.686
all of them had described it in their own
styles and own ways but amounting to the same.

00:13:50.686 --> 00:13:54.344
Once you get it, you'll be surprised, is
the same like everybody [UNCLEAR]

00:13:54.344 --> 00:14:01.189
and what were we fighting about - because
of darkness. Everywhere the same light,

00:14:01.189 --> 00:14:06.975
same thing has been described and it's
just the same happening. It's what happens

00:14:06.975 --> 00:14:11.303
to you, that once you get this light,
you get the Collective Consciousness.

00:14:12.439 --> 00:14:18.113
Means, you start seeing the another
person's problem and your own problems.

00:14:18.113 --> 00:14:23.294
It's very simple. Like the light, when it
comes, it does two things. It sees it's own

00:14:23.294 --> 00:14:29.789
filth and also shows others what filth
they have got. It automatically happens.

00:14:29.789 --> 00:14:35.079
Now what do you do about it - nothing, you
light it. It is built-in in the character,

00:14:35.079 --> 00:14:41.478
in the swabhava, as they call it and in the
nature of light to do it. In the same way,

00:14:41.478 --> 00:14:50.400
it is built-in into Atma, in the Spirit. It
just does. Once it starts manifesting it

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:57.270
powers, you become Collectively Conscious.
So what am I doing here, is this that I'm

00:14:57.270 --> 00:15:04.856
just decoding to you how you must deal with
yourself. For example, as Gregoire has said

00:15:04.856 --> 00:15:11.151
the wind starts flowing, which is been described
by a complete book by Adi Shankaracharya,

00:15:11.179 --> 00:15:16.509
that a cool breeze starts flowing from the
hand, known as Chaitanya Lahiri starts flowing.

00:15:16.509 --> 00:15:21.389
Christ has described it that, somebody
touched Him, He said, "Something went
from My body into another."

00:15:21.389 --> 00:15:26.388
All these things have been described. In
the Bible it is described. The Kundalini

00:15:26.388 --> 00:15:32.183
itself is described as I, many, many words
but one of them is very important is said,

00:15:32.183 --> 00:15:37.703
"I will appear before you like tongues of
flames." All these things have been

00:15:37.703 --> 00:15:42.889
described and told to you, thanks to these
modern times that you are born today, when

00:15:42.889 --> 00:15:47.084
you cannot say these things are not
been told but we keep them aside.

00:15:47.084 --> 00:15:55.671
In religion also we take to new ideas, new
things but in matter we take to antiques.

00:15:56.364 --> 00:16:03.124
Religion should be real antique while the
matter should be modern. Just the opposite

00:16:03.124 --> 00:16:07.707
we'll move. We take to religion that is
coming up modern. Now today Mataji

00:16:07.707 --> 00:16:12.485
has come, let's have it. It's a guru
shopping going on. So through Mataji

00:16:12.485 --> 00:16:17.257
to another one they move. So they have
another guru - nice. "This is the latest

00:16:17.257 --> 00:16:21.840
guru has come in the market, you see.
Listen na, I tell you he's a very good one."

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:27.943
That's not the judgment point. Judgment
point is, what powers have you got yourself?

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:36.810
Are you still a beggar? Have you been enriched
yourself? What has your guru given to you?

00:16:39.759 --> 00:16:45.229
What has he done for you? He has been
enslaving you or he has given you freedom?

00:16:47.635 --> 00:16:53.315
Has he given you your powers inside?
That is the judgment point. Do not get

00:16:53.327 --> 00:16:58.147
identified with anyone of them, with anyone
of these ideas that will keep you down.

00:16:58.147 --> 00:17:10.442
Try to identify with yourself. Your Self is
your guru. I'm not your guru, I'm your Mother.

00:17:10.442 --> 00:17:15.221
You know how gurus are terrible people
- I'm not that. I'm just your Mother

00:17:15.221 --> 00:17:20.162
but what I'm trying to tell you, as a Mother
would tell you, that your guru is sitting

00:17:20.162 --> 00:17:27.410
in your heart - is the Self itself. Listen
to your Self and you can only listen to

00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:34.022
your Self when you get your realization,
when you start receiving information and

00:17:34.022 --> 00:17:38.531
you have a rapport, when there is a
communication and when you can talk to

00:17:38.531 --> 00:17:47.906
yourself, then only you are entitled.
Before that, to you, religion is not known

00:17:47.906 --> 00:17:55.614
- Avidya - is complete non-knowledge. The
rest of it is all in this world, you see, you can find.

00:17:55.614 --> 00:18:00.291
I mean, by raising churches, by raising temples,
by raising all these things you cannot find God.

00:18:02.744 --> 00:18:09.134
Temple is in here, in your own heart,
your Self - only the light has to be put

00:18:10.512 --> 00:18:15.712
and you seek the day will put within you
is your Self which is the most beautiful

00:18:15.712 --> 00:18:20.916
thing to know about, is the most
joy giving - Sachitanand

00:18:22.682 --> 00:18:28.322
- but it should happen to you. Now it has
not happened to some people, it's good

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:35.950
You see, this is the shop which sells
things, which may not [UNCLEAR - GO?]

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:43.487
into your hands. Even if we sell it, it
may slip off, it may disappear.

00:18:43.487 --> 00:18:49.581
You see, it's a funny sort where you don't
pay for it but we force things on you,

00:18:49.581 --> 00:18:55.258
take it home. On the way you find it is
lost. You go home you find it's gone.

00:18:55.258 --> 00:19:00.185
You say, "O Mother, You gave us these things.
Where did we lose it, how did we lose it?"

00:19:00.185 --> 00:19:07.627
My child - there were holes. I've seen, in
your Kundalini there are terrible holes

00:19:07.627 --> 00:19:11.981
what people have.[UNCLEAR] I say, "O God,
what have they done to themselves!"

00:19:12.626 --> 00:19:20.486
I've seen big, big holes in your Kundalini.
You don't know how many satanic forces

00:19:20.486 --> 00:19:26.855
have worked out. The other day I was
reading a book on war and I knew it was

00:19:26.855 --> 00:19:32.256
hypnosis, complete hypnosis. Even Hitler
was a possessed man. I saw his photograph.

00:19:32.256 --> 00:19:38.123
I said, this fellow, he is himself is a rakshasa
and he's also possessed and what he did,

00:19:38.123 --> 00:19:45.276
is to get all the satanic to destroy the
people completely, to take away all your

00:19:45.276 --> 00:19:49.345
values, everything but today let Hitler
come, so many won't think even.

00:19:49.345 --> 00:19:54.924
You know, finally they'll have more people
here than I have. Yes, it's a true thing.

00:19:56.271 --> 00:20:00.231
Let Hitler come back. There'll be so
many coming with their hidden ideas

00:20:00.231 --> 00:20:04.491
how to destroy themselves but for
construction, you'll get very few.

00:20:04.611 --> 00:20:07.836
Still we have quite a lot in London
- I never expected.

00:20:09.217 --> 00:20:15.437
So, this is a very subtle happening
which works out but ask for it.

00:20:15.737 --> 00:20:20.437
There's a protocol about it. If you have
not asked, if you think you are very great,

00:20:20.437 --> 00:20:27.555
I think it is fake and false [UNCLEAR].
I'm talking from your side and from the

00:20:27.555 --> 00:20:34.427
side of the deities too but the whole thing
misses and it doesn't work out on you at all,

00:20:34.427 --> 00:20:40.232
so just listen to Me and just understand.
For example, the other day - he's not

00:20:40.232 --> 00:20:46.201
come as yet today, Philip has not come.
We had Philip here. He's a great musician

00:20:46.201 --> 00:20:52.660
and I didn't know who he was and he started
seeing auras and things and all that again

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:57.360
around Me as he saw lots of things, as
Gregoire has described but what's the use?

00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:02.317
You just tell Me, you have read them. Krishna
has shown His twelve powers - now what's the use?

00:21:04.636 --> 00:21:08.710
What have you got out of it? Baba,
even if you say, Christ coming down

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:13.668
- now what is going to happen? If you see
it going up and down, now what is there coming?

00:21:14.497 --> 00:21:17.949
What do you achieve out of it?
What do you get out of it?

00:21:17.949 --> 00:21:21.942
Only by seeing? You see Me talking here,
wonder what do you get?

00:21:23.166 --> 00:21:27.053
Why do you worship Me also, if you do
not get anything out of Me?

00:21:28.539 --> 00:21:34.059
Why should you accept Me if you do not get
any of your Self-knowledge or anything?

00:21:34.059 --> 00:21:43.545
Just for that sake because I'm wearing a
white saree. How telling it about

00:21:43.545 --> 00:21:50.654
greatness about yourself, why are you
accepting something? Christ came - He had

00:21:50.654 --> 00:21:59.368
a very subtle job, He did, He did but today
the time has come to culminate the whole thing

00:21:59.368 --> 00:22:04.491
whatever Christ has done, whatever Krishna
has done. They all have places within us

00:22:04.491 --> 00:22:09.021
built-in, you see and we have given you
all these things, you can see for yourself

00:22:09.021 --> 00:22:13.704
how They are built-in ourselves, when
where are They placed in the Kundalini,

00:22:13.704 --> 00:22:18.024
where are They, how is the pure chaste
Kundalini your mother, your own mother is

00:22:18.024 --> 00:22:24.447
staying in that pink and how Ganesha, the
embodiment of innocence, is guarding you.

00:22:25.333 --> 00:22:29.833
Sex has nothing to do with religion, all
nonsense. Don't believe in all these stories.

00:22:29.833 --> 00:22:33.038
You see, I'm not going to tell you the
untruth because it appeals to you.

00:22:33.038 --> 00:22:37.136
Even if you deny Me, even if there is not
one person here, I'm not going to tell you

00:22:37.136 --> 00:22:39.466
that you have sex with your mother.

00:22:40.686 --> 00:22:44.160
This you must know that I will not tell
you that whatever is not the truth

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:49.782
because I'm not here for any political
gains also commercial gains - no sir.

00:22:50.676 --> 00:22:57.226
I'm here for your own gain about genuineness,
if you want to gain spiritually now.

00:22:57.936 --> 00:23:03.745
Now see for yourself if this is the case
or not. You can see with your naked eyes,

00:23:03.745 --> 00:23:09.925
- few people have seen the Kundalini
pulsating, you can see. It pulsates.

00:23:09.925 --> 00:23:14.694
When people touch My feet, in many cases
it pulsates. They have seen it.

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:24.248
They are not all liars and why should they
lie? Nothing to gain, no money, first of all

00:23:24.248 --> 00:23:33.968
that cut out, so what is the other thing?
This Kundalini rises and you can see it's rising,

00:23:33.968 --> 00:23:38.890
passes through all these chakras and it
stops at a place where you have a problem.

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:43.896
On the other day, we had a very good man
from somewhere who came to see Me and

00:23:43.896 --> 00:23:49.719
his Kundalini came up and was just pulsating
here, [UNCLEAR] like that and the whole this part

00:23:49.719 --> 00:23:56.174
was pulsating like that, I mean, only that part,
so the people asked him, "Are you alright?"

00:23:56.174 --> 00:24:00.763
He said, "Yes, I'm alright," "But do you have
a liver problem?" "Yes, I have. How do you know?"

00:24:00.763 --> 00:24:06.996
"You can see it. Kundalini itself is suggesting.
It's pulsating, so you have to correct the liver,

00:24:06.996 --> 00:24:13.501
you have to correct the whole being. So many
problems - physical, mental and emotional -

00:24:14.297 --> 00:24:19.557
so whatever may be the problem, I've sorted
them out. All permutations and combinations

00:24:19.595 --> 00:24:24.415
have worked out now. Perhaps, there is no
permutation that now I can say that is

00:24:24.415 --> 00:24:30.142
not worked out, except for one that is
the worst of all, is misidentification.

00:24:32.156 --> 00:24:37.986
If you carry on with misidentifications,
we cannot help you. You must know that

00:24:37.986 --> 00:24:44.407
you must identify with your Self and with
nothing else, then only it works out.

00:24:45.432 --> 00:24:50.962
That is the only thing, is the misidentification
with any untruth. Ask for the Truth and

00:24:50.962 --> 00:24:55.701
Truth will be given to you but ask for the Truth,
not the truth that you have made as Truth.

00:24:56.499 --> 00:25:01.399
Truth is as it is. You cannot mix it, you
cannot give it a form. You cannot say,

00:25:01.442 --> 00:25:06.532
"This is the Truth." No - it is what it is.
You have to see it, you have to be that,

00:25:06.663 --> 00:25:13.483
you have to appreciate it, you have to
become that. Look at people, how do they

00:25:13.483 --> 00:25:18.282
pass remarks at Christ! Even person like
Christ. You see, everybody has become so

00:25:18.282 --> 00:25:22.420
ego-oriented, I mean, they think, if
they have a right to criticize everyone.

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:29.177
Christ is a person about you cannot think.
For Sahaja yogis I cannot challenge this much.

00:25:29.177 --> 00:25:32.890
They are realized souls. When they start
thinking about Christ, they become thoughtless.

00:25:34.067 --> 00:25:39.077
He is beyond thinking - how can you
rationalize Him and bring Him to this level

00:25:39.077 --> 00:25:44.952
and put Him to this level that you become
a critic in the BBC's, asking questions

00:25:44.952 --> 00:25:53.713
"So how did You have your resurrection?"
How can you understand? What do you know

00:25:53.713 --> 00:25:59.631
about [UNCLEAR]? What do you know about
Divine working? What do you understand

00:25:59.631 --> 00:26:07.273
His style of doing things? This little human
mind can only become a drop in the ocean

00:26:07.273 --> 00:26:13.530
which cannot understand the ocean and it's
working. This is the thing we have to realize

00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:19.354
and once we realize that we are part of
this ocean, we become the ocean also.

00:26:20.188 --> 00:26:25.586
But this is not lecturing, again I'm
telling you, it is a happening - you start

00:26:25.586 --> 00:26:32.246
feeling others immediately. When you are
a drop outside the ocean, you do not feel

00:26:32.246 --> 00:26:36.067
what other drops are there in the ocean
but once you jump into the ocean,

00:26:36.067 --> 00:26:41.268
you start feeling everyone in your hands
absolutely, rationally which can be understood.

00:26:42.362 --> 00:26:49.312
In the fingers all the chakras you feel.
Now this knowledge about Kundalini, was

00:26:49.312 --> 00:26:54.643
not known even to the greatest sages,
even to, I would say, to people like Narada

00:26:55.298 --> 00:27:01.408
it was not known. It was not needed that
time - the time has not come. You know

00:27:01.408 --> 00:27:05.224
when, say for example, electricity is not
created what's the use of telling them

00:27:05.224 --> 00:27:14.053
about the switches. They may realize, also
they had vibrations alright but they didn't

00:27:14.053 --> 00:27:18.417
know that this is the chakras and they catch
and these are the things that are missing

00:27:18.417 --> 00:27:23.215
and this, they did not know. The time had not
come. Some of them are really jealous of

00:27:23.215 --> 00:27:27.700
the modern people. They think, "What have
these modern people done that they should

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:33.269
get all this knowledge?" That debated is
the main point. These people try to show off

00:27:33.269 --> 00:27:38.075
so much - alright, go ahead; They are fixed
up as some officers, some were in charge of

00:27:38.075 --> 00:27:43.236
this and all - officers-in-charge but they
are not going to be the [UNCLEAR - INTENDERS?]

00:27:43.926 --> 00:27:49.986
For example, all these people like Indra
and the gods who are incharge of the weather

00:27:49.986 --> 00:27:54.870
and all that, are settled down very nicely
on the right side of Gods, arranging things

00:27:54.870 --> 00:28:02.243
for you like the caretaker of this building
but you are the people who are enjoying the

00:28:02.243 --> 00:28:08.800
fruits of it - what can we do? You
waited, you've got it and if you get it,

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:13.615
that's in your right. But this I do not do
to pamper your ego again - do it no right

00:28:14.147 --> 00:28:19.897
because you have to get it, you have to
settle it and the Self-knowledge is the

00:28:19.897 --> 00:28:25.352
thing where you are just in the center. There
neither you are in the ego nor in the superego -

00:28:25.352 --> 00:28:30.185
you are in the center and a space is
created on your forehead in the Sahastrara

00:28:30.185 --> 00:28:35.396
if you see, when the Kundalini rises. The
gap between this, between the this green bag,

00:28:35.396 --> 00:28:39.864
fills up when the Kundalini rises, She goes
up and opens this Sahastrara,

00:28:39.864 --> 00:28:45.536
which we call as baptism and there our
[UNCLEAR] you enter into that subtle awareness

00:28:45.536 --> 00:28:51.928
of Collective Consciousness. But, as soon
as your Kundalini crosses this chakra of Agnya,

00:28:51.928 --> 00:28:56.249
immediately you become thoughtlessly
aware - means, you will be aware but

00:28:56.249 --> 00:29:02.452
there won't be any thought, which is
described by Hume and what he has talked

00:29:02.452 --> 00:29:07.037
about Collective Consciousness from where
we get the ideas and things, that is the

00:29:07.037 --> 00:29:13.653
portion you reach means, it becomes
your own nature. It is an actualization -

00:29:13.653 --> 00:29:18.894
it is not talking. It is an actualization,
your body becomes that; Like a human being

00:29:18.894 --> 00:29:24.085
you become a super human being. From a
animal to a human being, there is definitely

00:29:24.085 --> 00:29:30.538
difference in awareness, in the same way,
there is a difference in the awareness of a man

00:29:30.538 --> 00:29:38.497
and a superman but the only exception is
that, in your own consciousness you see it happen.

00:29:41.474 --> 00:29:48.824
Is the only human beings can see their
evolution and not the animals because

00:29:48.824 --> 00:29:54.887
you have been given freedom to see that.
But the way the freedom has been used,

00:29:54.887 --> 00:30:00.134
you can write volumes on that, so better
not go into that way. Let us forget about it.

00:30:00.134 --> 00:30:04.411
If we can do without going through the
mistakes, if we can manage it, better do it but

00:30:04.411 --> 00:30:12.147
if the mistakes are there, we'll face them all.
I'm with you throughout, absolutely with you

00:30:12.147 --> 00:30:17.327
and it should work out. Now, if we say
that, "This is wrong, we should not do this,"

00:30:17.327 --> 00:30:21.990
don't get angry with Me. For example, the
other day I told somebody that

00:30:22.005 --> 00:30:26.585
[UNCLEAR - FRUITS?] and alcohol goes against
[UNCLEAR], he got very angry with Me.

00:30:26.585 --> 00:30:32.393
I said, "Do you have a shot? Why are you
angry?" I mean, it's a simple thing I'm

00:30:32.393 --> 00:30:36.993
telling you. Should I tell you, you go and get
drunk? Should I tell you? Is it a good thing?

00:30:36.993 --> 00:30:41.262
You can do anything with your sex - should
I tell you? Now you tell Me one, in this

00:30:41.262 --> 00:30:48.084
whole world, where you have all kinds
of moralities, so called, where is a man

00:30:48.084 --> 00:30:53.480
crowned for drinking? In the whole world,
in the whole [UNCLEAR] - tell Me, any man

00:30:53.480 --> 00:31:00.271
crowned for more drinking, getting drunk or a
statue erect telling this - have you seen any?

00:31:02.958 --> 00:31:09.118
Have you seen any man being garlanded
for being licentious and permissive?

00:31:11.777 --> 00:31:16.797
That means, collectively human-beings
never accepted this kind of a nonsense,

00:31:17.982 --> 00:31:22.072
so far. I mean, I don't know, collectively everybody
becomes a Satan, then God alone knows

00:31:22.072 --> 00:31:27.422
but even in the Roman Empire, when it was
the worst of all at that time, this was not.

00:31:30.387 --> 00:31:37.707
So collectively, human-beings have always
accepted holiness, righteousness as the great things

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:45.550
and even till today, those people who
lived in ordinary houses and huts, are

00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:51.837
respected and huge, big properties are made
in their names because that name itself,

00:31:51.837 --> 00:32:00.026
gives them that power but they are misusing it,
they are insulting them, they are actually hurting

00:32:00.026 --> 00:32:07.216
the source of all these things. It's a tremendous
wound but what to do? Human beings do it

00:32:07.216 --> 00:32:13.552
for their self checks; They do it out of
ignorance. If they do it out of ignorance,

00:32:13.552 --> 00:32:18.289
it will be forgiven; Everything will be
forgiven - take it from Me - and you'll be

00:32:18.289 --> 00:32:24.181
amazed how it works out. Now, I would say,
if you have any questions, you better ask Me

00:32:24.181 --> 00:32:28.670
because, I think, still I have not been able
to answer all your questions inspite I know

00:32:28.670 --> 00:32:33.686
what is in your mind. So, any one of you
have any questions, please ask Me before

00:32:33.686 --> 00:32:38.318
we start the program but not too much of it
because some are just there and if we ask

00:32:38.318 --> 00:32:42.186
funny, foolish, stupid questions we are
going to divert their attention. We have

00:32:42.186 --> 00:32:47.204
not achieved it, we are not there. We are
still nervous, we are no where, so please

00:32:47.204 --> 00:32:52.399
don't disturb others. That is important. If
you are doing it only for the say [UNCLEAR],

00:32:52.399 --> 00:32:54.909
you do it otherwise you are just
trying to show off.

00:32:54.909 --> 00:32:57.589
The other day somebody said,
"In this book this is written."

00:32:57.589 --> 00:33:00.640
Now, am I going to answer for all
the books that are written? No.

00:33:01.255 --> 00:33:06.844
Actually, I'm not even a graduate.
How much did Christ study?

00:33:08.107 --> 00:33:10.507
This is another knowledge
I'm talking about,

00:33:10.507 --> 00:33:14.503
so don't waste your energy and My
energy as well [UNCLEAR]. If you have come

00:33:14.503 --> 00:33:19.226
here to show off, I would request you
go away because this is not to show off

00:33:19.226 --> 00:33:28.154
but to show in. So, that's the worry.
Do not try to play with yourself.

00:33:28.154 --> 00:33:33.112
Again and again I request you. It's a
wasted a lot of your lives in seeking and

00:33:33.112 --> 00:33:39.446
the time has come. Gregoire says, he was
not a saint but he is. You're all saints

00:33:39.446 --> 00:33:44.086
otherwise you would not be here. You
would be sitting in some discotheque or if

00:33:44.086 --> 00:33:51.623
not there, in some racecourse, you see -
somewhere there but when you are here, you are saints.

00:33:51.623 --> 00:33:55.537
These are the saints, who have the right
to get it but you have to be a saint.

00:33:55.537 --> 00:34:00.818
You should have seeking of the real type.
If you are real and genuine, it will happen

00:34:00.818 --> 00:34:06.125
and work out. I would like you to ask Me questions
if there is any explanation needed or anything.

00:34:07.503 --> 00:34:11.543
- Seeker: [INDISTINCT]
- Oh, you will get - yes. May God bless You!

00:34:11.543 --> 00:34:13.976
I'm so happy.

00:34:22.332 --> 00:34:27.012
So he asked Me a very funny question.
Not funny, I would say but [UNCLEAR]

00:34:27.301 --> 00:34:31.601
because I had gone to some place with My
disciples, you see and likes to meet Me.

00:34:31.601 --> 00:34:35.802
Still they are coming now. They have got
realization. Some of them have not that [UNCLEAR]

00:34:35.802 --> 00:34:40.083
but I have to use their vibrations first.
You know there are all types of people.

00:34:41.427 --> 00:34:47.017
He asked Me a question, "Do they embarrass
You sometimes?" I said, "I don't know."

00:34:50.427 --> 00:34:55.777
Because no body is perfect and My job is
to perfect them. That means it's My doing

00:34:55.777 --> 00:35:00.543
and I have failed somewhere also, I have
to all father them - that's all.

00:35:00.543 --> 00:35:04.124
How can they embarrass Me? How can
the children embarrass the mother?

00:35:05.374 --> 00:35:09.033
[UNCLEAR] with them all the time,
whatever they are

00:35:09.033 --> 00:35:13.596
and it will help Her to perfect them in Her
own way and in Her own loving capacity.

00:35:14.896 --> 00:35:19.626
Now, how will I [UNCLEAR] with the moral
[UNCLEAR] that's one more important point

00:35:19.626 --> 00:35:26.449
is that in Sahaja yog, you have to have
your parents and your father.

00:35:27.044 --> 00:35:32.254
not in that kind of a good fellow
but, you see, there are parents who do not

00:35:32.254 --> 00:35:36.454
understand spirituality. They are not
seekers, I know them but they have place

00:35:36.454 --> 00:35:41.342
in your being, you know, on the right hand
side of your heart you have two chakras.

00:35:41.342 --> 00:35:46.837
Have you made them? Yes. See the right
side of this Sun, where the Sun has been

00:35:47.405 --> 00:35:53.695
No, you haven't made that [UNCLEAR].
On the heart chakra - no, they haven't.

00:35:54.665 --> 00:36:00.325
On the blue one, I think, it's the heart
- alright? Just a little higher than this.

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:07.380
Now, on the right hand side, but it should be
a little higher, it's not there [UNCLEAR].

00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:13.932
Now on the right hand side, is the chakra,
what we call, is the right hand chakra but

00:36:13.932 --> 00:36:19.703
it is actually, in Sanskrit language it is not
called as heart chakra but is called Anahat

00:36:19.703 --> 00:36:26.767
Anahat, Anahat and the Anahat chakra
is in the here above, here it is.

00:36:26.767 --> 00:36:32.424
It feels, it is above the void, little above
the void, here and on the left hand side

00:36:33.382 --> 00:36:38.642
it is Mother's chakra. So, if there's any
problem with your parents, that shows.

00:36:39.522 --> 00:36:46.572
[UNCLEAR] and that's why you have to forgive
each other. You don't have to punish your parents.

00:36:46.572 --> 00:36:49.854
Forgive them, forgive them - that's the
main thing you should do to forgive them

00:36:49.854 --> 00:36:56.098
because after all they're not here but you
show them [UNCLEAR] of their [UNCLEAR],

00:36:56.098 --> 00:37:00.602
so you should not be angry with Me when
I told you that you forgive your parents.

00:37:00.602 --> 00:37:04.359
[UNCLEAR] some of them do get very
angry with Me for telling this.

00:37:04.829 --> 00:37:08.009
I do not tell you bad things.

00:37:14.648 --> 00:37:23.858
So you, so, what other problems?
[UNCLEAR - DO YOU HAVE?] any questions.

00:37:29.903 --> 00:37:35.803
We have two or three people who are born
realized. Anna herself is, we have got

00:37:36.698 --> 00:37:44.308
Alery, [UNCLEAR] he's a born realized.
William has come [UNCLEAR] - no, not today.

00:37:44.768 --> 00:37:51.278
Uh, who else is, uh.. what was his
name, Hallic, Hallic is there.

00:37:51.278 --> 00:37:54.970
Hallic met us only last program.
He's a born realized.

00:37:54.970 --> 00:37:58.726
You see, we have many here [UNCLEAR]
who are born realized ones -

00:37:58.726 --> 00:38:03.470
it's possible. Some of you are really born
realized but don't know where are you, really.

00:38:03.939 --> 00:38:08.079
So, there could be a thing like that and
that's such a help you don't know because

00:38:08.079 --> 00:38:11.233
now we're understanding the complete
[UNCLEAR] because they were all lost.

00:38:11.233 --> 00:38:17.834
They were thinking they were something
out of the blue, some funny people, some

00:38:17.834 --> 00:38:23.970
strangely people who are not understood by
anybody and they were distressed, you see,

00:38:23.970 --> 00:38:33.039
but now they find the [UNCLEAR]. So, you
put your hands towards Me, like this

00:38:33.341 --> 00:38:38.361
and if you have shoes also, you take out
because it's better once we [UNCLEAR]

00:38:38.361 --> 00:38:42.580
and even one day he got angry with Me
because I said, "You take out shoes,"

00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:47.503
I mean, this is bit too much, isn't it? I
mean, even if you cannot take out your shoes,

00:38:47.503 --> 00:38:57.638
then I'm very upset. Just like this you
put your hands towards Me. What about you?

00:38:58.774 --> 00:39:04.694
Will you go at the back. What's the matter?
Why don't you? Why have you come here?

00:39:05.466 --> 00:39:07.416
- Annh?
- [UNCLEAR]

00:39:07.416 --> 00:39:16.588
- What is.. what he's saying? Annh?
- [UNCLEAR]

00:39:16.588 --> 00:39:20.585
You see, if you don't want to do what is
required, please leave us alone.

00:39:20.585 --> 00:39:25.005
Yes, you see, there is a ritual, a little
ritual is there, only this one - alright?

00:39:25.005 --> 00:39:28.529
- You can take your jacket.
- You can take your jacket, please.

00:39:32.254 --> 00:39:36.704
You see, there is no ritual but you see,
after all it would be something like light

00:39:36.704 --> 00:39:43.675
has to go near the light or not.
Even this one [UNCLEAR] just imagine

00:39:43.675 --> 00:39:49.761
is it too much choice? What do you
expect - God to fall at your feet?

00:39:56.762 --> 00:40:02.612
All kinds of damages have been done
[UNCLEAR] but some of guru [UNCLEAR]

00:40:04.283 --> 00:40:09.253
like Krishnamurthy says that, "You should not
believe in anybody." Don't believe in falsehood

00:40:09.253 --> 00:40:12.717
but believe in the reality. How can you
say that? You see, extremes they are!

00:40:13.353 --> 00:40:18.433
He doesn't mean anything bad but what they're
doing bad. He has denied also the reality part.

00:40:20.497 --> 00:40:24.537
It is a very naive reaction
to human beings - they don't understand.

00:40:24.751 --> 00:40:29.381
Human beings are very, very delicate
beings. The gentleman will come back;

00:40:29.443 --> 00:40:34.213
Don't you worry but he's ego oriented.

00:40:39.793 --> 00:40:45.033
Just like this. Put your hands, feet
like this, little bit.

00:40:45.033 --> 00:40:49.234
Neither very much relaxed nor
absolutely tensed up. Machinder,

00:40:50.169 --> 00:40:54.269
just [UNCLEAR] up, like this [UNCLEAR].

00:41:05.574 --> 00:41:10.524
Some people may feel a little burning
in some of the fingers, maybe, little bit

00:41:10.524 --> 00:41:15.725
but maybe little heat but don't you worry.
You're feeling heat - then it will disappear.

00:41:15.725 --> 00:41:19.336
You see, there's a little resistance or
sort of thing and then it disappears.

00:41:19.336 --> 00:41:24.465
Then it becomes cool, absolutely you
feel very cool despite the hot Sun.

00:41:30.157 --> 00:41:36.017
Where is the problem? Here

00:41:38.167 --> 00:41:42.827
You are a physically weak or there's some
problem in your stomach or somewhere,

00:41:42.827 --> 00:41:47.222
then it will stop there, you might feel
a little wobbling or something like that

00:41:47.222 --> 00:41:51.917
in abnormal case but normally [UNCLEAR]
is that the first moment [UNCLEAR]

00:41:51.917 --> 00:41:59.044
then it sees Me, sort of, out of joy perhaps
maybe and it comes up and just now what I find

00:41:59.044 --> 00:42:03.895
that on the left hand side you should be at
the back here, there's a problem, a little bit

00:42:03.895 --> 00:42:10.010
so, this is, this is a problem of the
Conscience, you see, so do not have

00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:14.778
anything on your Conscience just now.
That is, you should do, is to say that, "No."

00:42:16.673 --> 00:42:22.323
Now you see, the Conscience and all these
ideas also come through ego. If you have

00:42:22.323 --> 00:42:27.666
no ego, what is the Conscience? If you are
beyond your ego, what is the Conscience?

00:42:27.666 --> 00:42:34.045
Who is the ego? It is He who is doing it, so
don't try to blame your Conscience for anything.

00:42:34.294 --> 00:42:39.604
That is what is needed. Just now if that
is the point, it will still stop there.

00:42:39.604 --> 00:42:43.789
And those, who have already got cool
breeze can close their eyes.

00:42:51.541 --> 00:42:56.731
To your Sahastrara, means to your
fontanel bone on top of your head,

00:42:56.731 --> 00:43:01.863
just try to pay attention what's happening
there? Just don't push it, just see

00:43:01.863 --> 00:43:12.992
what's happening there. Just pay attention.
Raise it from heart to your Sahastrara,

00:43:12.992 --> 00:43:21.988
that is the top of your head. Again and
again raise it. Haan. It's going up.

00:43:23.528 --> 00:43:28.648
[UNCLEAR] should do it, that cool breeze,
that's better [UNCLEAR]. You may keep it

00:43:28.648 --> 00:43:35.115
like this. Your few chakras are left to
rise. Just [UNCLEAR] move it [UNCLEAR]

00:43:37.606 --> 00:43:45.136
Are you feeling cool breeze? Vishuddhi
still catching over here, Vishuddhi -

00:43:45.136 --> 00:43:49.041
because of the mantras, you see, it has
spoilt.

00:43:52.199 --> 00:44:01.789
Move around. It's there. Alright?
