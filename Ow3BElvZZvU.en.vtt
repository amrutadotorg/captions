00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.849
the machinery inside us

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:04.300
it has seven curtains

00:00:04.325 --> 00:00:09.716
They have to awaken
you in this way.

00:00:10.783 --> 00:00:12.933
Now when we talk about machinery

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.966
So those people
miss such machinery

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.083
that which is not alive

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.983
but a living machinery for him

00:00:24.633 --> 00:00:27.333
It has to be awakened,
it has to be awakened.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.626
But many people do
not even understand that

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.933
what cannot be done with these vibrations!

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:38.542
I have told you that when vibrations

00:00:39.167 --> 00:00:40.999
are flowing completely from within you

00:00:41.083 --> 00:00:43.632
and there is not the slightest

00:00:43.842 --> 00:00:51.658
complaint about it, then
you are in complete bliss.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:01:01.083
Whatever physical, mental, or
intellectual problems you may have

00:01:03.983 --> 00:01:05.883
You are completely unwell;

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.350
If the vibrations are flowing
through your body at full strength.

00:01:10.916 --> 00:01:13.316
You are thoughtless
as a witness,

00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:17.583
This is an indication, this is an
indication, this is an indication

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.900
That you have become
fully what you are capable of.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.900
Now those who do not flow,
who remain half incomplete,

00:01:25.983 --> 00:01:27.283
what we miss

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.766
That fault is their own,

00:01:30.233 --> 00:01:32.633
It is neither of vibration
nor of Sahaja Yoga.

00:01:35.383 --> 00:01:38.033
I said physical,
mental, and intellectual.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.733
who are your guardians

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.045
they run away,

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.470
There are no
corpses in your body,

00:01:45.533 --> 00:01:46.690
But they are useful for you.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.350
You can pretend to be
angry whenever you want,

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.000
You can do whatever
drama you want.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.350
your mind is far reaching

00:02:05.533 --> 00:02:10.016
If you read Geeta after realization
then you can understand that

00:02:10.066 --> 00:02:11.400
What is the meaning of Geeta?

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.116
What is Geeta saying?

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.030
You come to the
element of knowledge.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.690
This is not just an indication,
it should also be thought about,

00:02:25.433 --> 00:02:28.616
This is an indication for you,
a sign for you that it is flowing.

00:02:29.533 --> 00:02:32.500
As if the car is moving, how ahead
Going, smoke is coming out from behind,

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:35.950
This is just a sign of it.

00:02:36.566 --> 00:02:40.900
But the car is moving,
what is this? How else ?

00:02:41.266 --> 00:02:42.650
This also has to
be thought about.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:57.133
When you were not in joy, when your
vibrations were not flowing from within

00:02:58.066 --> 00:03:02.516
At that time you did not
have any grant or contribution.

00:03:02.723 --> 00:03:03.800
No contribution,

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.050
you were just taking,

00:03:06.166 --> 00:03:07.633
You were taking it from nature,

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:10.433
You were taking nature as it is.

00:03:10.458 --> 00:03:11.533
you used to eat food,

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.683
You use the valuable
things on this earth.

00:03:17.666 --> 00:03:24.350
all that nature has created There
are things, you have been using them.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.866
You don't have to give him
anything, you only have to take;

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:36.183
you eat food, you wear clothes

00:03:37.183 --> 00:03:45.083
You lived in houses, all that stuff
Whatever brick you may have added to it,

00:03:46.073 --> 00:03:47.130
I am all that,

00:03:47.316 --> 00:03:51.750
You have taken something
from nature, not from nature.

00:03:52.716 --> 00:03:56.266
But when the vibration from within you
When you start flowing, you start giving.

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.250
You should understand
the way you give naturally.

00:04:04.268 --> 00:04:06.149
just came from an eggman today

00:04:06.243 --> 00:04:07.333
both husband and wife

00:04:07.433 --> 00:04:08.500
He started telling me that

00:04:08.533 --> 00:04:10.599
in our garden On
the sapota tree,

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.616
With great difficulty the
cheeks were attached to it,

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.933
And there was no taste at all
in it, there was nothing at all,

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:18.903
And we only mother,

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.066
You came to our house once,

00:04:20.091 --> 00:04:21.258
You came to our house once,

00:04:21.283 --> 00:04:23.483
And after washing your
feet, he used to pour its water,

00:04:23.483 --> 00:04:25.766
Then we gave vibrations.

00:04:25.933 --> 00:04:29.516
So, about a thousand sapotas arrive
in our area every two to three days.

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.566
And he brought it today to show.

00:04:32.043 --> 00:04:33.800
What a beautiful
fragrance was coming.

00:04:35.504 --> 00:04:39.446
And so many good bananas
grew on the banana tree here.

00:04:39.993 --> 00:04:43.500
This means that here we have so much It is
a great surprise that it has become greener.

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:46.445
In the same land, in the same
season, no fertilizer was applied there.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.800
-Did not put anything,

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:49.266
Just added vibrated water,

00:04:49.266 --> 00:04:50.516
and gave my vibrations

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:51.966
And see how the nature is there.

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.333
Now you, when the
vibrations come inside you

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.166
Then it is yours to pay.

00:04:57.599 --> 00:04:59.333
you are giving vibrations

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:02.315
as if you are oozing
consciousness

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.350
from within yourself

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.650
And you are injecting
consciousness into nature.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.883
You don't know, you don't
know, you don't know this.

00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:13.183
Just as sages and sages
used to go to the forests earlier.

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:14.766
And he used to go
there and meditate.

00:05:15.383 --> 00:05:17.283
Because the peace of nature,

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.200
Its balance and harmony,

00:05:20.566 --> 00:05:21.635
Its balance,

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:22.933
be united in it

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.900
And that will make
them familiar to them,

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.133
There may be some
effect on their chakras,

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.216
That by sitting in
such a beautiful place,

00:05:33.556 --> 00:05:35.300
May their hearts rejoice,

00:05:35.581 --> 00:05:40.566
And by staying there it is possible that
their Let the Kundilini power within awaken

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.066
And they should attain
that ultimate essence.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.616
But after realization I

00:05:46.133 --> 00:05:54.066
You become so adorned
with this thing, these vibrations.

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:56.999
That you yourself are a giver,

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:00.866
Knowledge comes to you
yourself and you donate it to nature.

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.316
Wherever you go, you don't know,

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.366
But after seeing you and
receiving your vibrations

00:06:07.826 --> 00:06:15.766
Flowers, leaves, trees, birds,
animals, (unintelligible) feel that spirit,

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:18.516
feel

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.816
They feel familiar
with it and feel happy.

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:24.799
You must have seen that there
was a white dog in our place.

00:06:24.886 --> 00:06:26.216
you guys will remember

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:28.100
his caste was very small

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.499
And he didn't even have
enough food to drink.

00:06:33.756 --> 00:06:35.750
but it was in very good health

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:38.250
And when we used to
take him to the doctor,

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:41.516
He used to ask what breed
it was, it was a stray dog.

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:45.099
It's grown so much
and it's understood

00:06:45.249 --> 00:06:46.366
and everything is

00:06:46.391 --> 00:06:49.205
And its health
is so first class,

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:52.016
If you send this to any show So
this one will always get first prize.

00:06:52.103 --> 00:06:55.166
A strange thing and
saw its vibrations myself,

00:06:55.225 --> 00:06:59.566
Because of those vibrations The
dog is also so strong and so athletic.

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:04.116
If you knew there were horses
Yes, horses understand everything.

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:08.449
And if he sees any ghost that night,
he The elders start screaming loudly.

00:07:08.733 --> 00:07:12.133
Sometimes dogs cry so you understand
Suppose they have seen something like this,

00:07:12.283 --> 00:07:14.983
Then they cry, they see it.

00:07:15.609 --> 00:07:16.683
They feel it.

00:07:17.016 --> 00:07:19.566
They cannot be seen with the
eyes, but can be felt from within.

00:07:19.583 --> 00:07:22.400
He will cry, I don't know why
he is crying, but he will cry.

00:07:22.749 --> 00:07:25.979
Similarly, the person
from whom the vibrations

00:07:26.003 --> 00:07:29.233
come, Dogs, cats, snakes,
everyone knows him.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.060
Children recognize.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:37.550
Your donations are complete.
Now you can enjoy in nature.

00:07:38.316 --> 00:07:40.683
You can let nature
inspire you too

00:07:40.766 --> 00:07:42.265
You can let nature
inspire you too

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:44.633
Because this thing is
flowing from inside you.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.245
Then you will say that
this is just old wedding,

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:51.965
All these are far away, then
what is it that when all If it

00:07:51.989 --> 00:07:55.683
is remote then why should
we eat every tree, thing, leaf.

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:00.533
This is the thing about that
man, it should be understood,

00:08:01.083 --> 00:08:03.249
Why are humans so important?

00:08:04.149 --> 00:08:05.383
There is a huge contrast.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:07.158
Why are humans so important?

00:08:07.183 --> 00:08:09.866
Why is mother bowing at
your feet again and again?

00:08:09.867 --> 00:08:11.795
Why is she working
so hard with you?

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:15.299
However, you people are
very slow moving people. Why?

00:08:15.632 --> 00:08:20.333
This is because man's These
vibrations passing from within are

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:27.133
They become such that the whole
earth You can take it, adopt it. That

00:08:32.823 --> 00:08:36.433
As if you have a cow, cow!

00:08:36.466 --> 00:08:39.133
Have you seen that
eat grass, drink water

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:46.349
And when it has milk, the
child can drink it and grow.

00:08:46.466 --> 00:08:48.083
If you let him eat
grass then the child

00:08:48.133 --> 00:08:49.783
The child won't even eat.

00:08:50.249 --> 00:08:51.416
It cannot grow on water;

00:08:51.449 --> 00:08:54.538
But only after going
inside the cow, Milk is

00:08:54.562 --> 00:08:57.650
produced which the
child drinks and grows up.

00:08:58.527 --> 00:09:04.150
Similarly in a realized man Only after
entering these vibrations a special scope,

00:09:04.216 --> 00:09:05.700
a very narrow range

00:09:05.749 --> 00:09:07.879
We carry within ourselves
those things which have come

00:09:08.003 --> 00:09:10.133
from the past. They work
even in the smallest detail.

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:11.200
Works perfectly.

00:09:11.999 --> 00:09:13.033
Propene is called jis.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.466
Exactly like that, they
become very subtle.

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:20.200
As soon as it enters the human
body, as soon as it enters the capillaries

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:22.500
These vibrations become
audible in exactly this way.

00:09:22.695 --> 00:09:26.937
They become capable
of being absorbed.

00:09:31.466 --> 00:09:33.100
How amazing Shuja is.

00:09:34.533 --> 00:09:39.016
Secondly, nature has also
created such places of its own.

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:45.833
We have created our own places in such a way
that Where such vibrations are satisfied.

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:50.633
This means that he is not a
human being but is like a stone;

00:09:51.219 --> 00:09:53.885
Nature has filled those
stones with these vibrations,

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:55.583
They have also been
given shape and form

00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:00.099
Like the dear nature of our place
You know and Ganesha is there,

00:10:00.436 --> 00:10:03.300
And there is Mahalakshmi
ji and our Mahadev ji.

00:10:03.462 --> 00:10:08.843
And in whatever place is created, If it is
filled with vibrations then it is vibrated;

00:10:09.698 --> 00:10:14.177
But also the vibrations that
are flowing are its awareness,

00:10:14.201 --> 00:10:18.216
its Handling, its upscale
is no more than you guys.

00:10:23.538 --> 00:10:28.633
You must understand that
this is a very subtle approach.

00:10:33.091 --> 00:10:34.683
Made very subtle.

00:10:35.099 --> 00:10:39.716
very fine to very fine
the tiniest of the tiniest

00:10:41.357 --> 00:10:48.249
You absorb it within yourself
first Do it and then you find it.

00:10:50.333 --> 00:10:53.583
All the pervading things
are flowing out of you, okay,

00:10:54.348 --> 00:10:56.449
But they are heard inside you

00:10:57.198 --> 00:10:59.470
And something or the
other, your grant for this

00:10:59.494 --> 00:11:01.666
is inside, that's why
they become so subtle

00:11:01.714 --> 00:11:03.165
So that people can achieve it.

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:04.999
Now understand your importance.

00:11:06.828 --> 00:11:11.816
Unless it passes through humans
Will molecular change not occur till then?

00:11:16.181 --> 00:11:17.181
But what is this,

00:11:20.088 --> 00:11:22.250
You should think, mother,
how does this happen?

00:11:23.004 --> 00:11:26.349
The all-pervading power
that comes from within

00:11:26.373 --> 00:11:30.166
man When she goes, what
special thing does she do?

00:11:30.188 --> 00:11:32.933
What does she achieve?
This is for you to see.

00:11:35.477 --> 00:11:40.166
When, If you look at the vast,
what is the vast thing?

00:11:42.828 --> 00:11:46.333
I am explaining it to you
on the basis of an example:

00:11:47.628 --> 00:11:51.033
That you a light or light aside and
place a picture in front of it on the right

00:11:51.888 --> 00:11:55.533
And place a picture
in front of it on the right

00:11:56.285 --> 00:11:57.750
And here you place the screen

00:11:58.011 --> 00:12:00.333
So you will see that
the big screen is ready,

00:12:01.125 --> 00:12:05.199
And a large version of the
same is ready on that screen.

00:12:07.574 --> 00:12:13.966
When these two things happen then this God
And this is his power and this is Virat.

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:21.783
Within this vast universe,
there is a lot of this power,

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:25.066
smallest, smallest, smallest

00:12:25.781 --> 00:12:27.848
Whatever creations
there are, all will be visible.

00:12:29.034 --> 00:12:31.733
Because they will become bigger,
they will become enlarged', bigger.

00:12:33.123 --> 00:12:35.216
Now I have explained
this in a very modern way,

00:12:35.516 --> 00:12:38.566
So it does not happen at once
because its dimensions are very high,

00:12:38.733 --> 00:12:41.124
But still I have written this
for you to understand. It has

00:12:41.148 --> 00:12:43.400
been explained in such a
way that you can understand it.

00:12:45.281 --> 00:12:48.983
Now that which is vast,
which is also primordial,

00:12:49.488 --> 00:12:57.433
He is huge, all the powers inside
him yes, all that power appears small

00:12:59.448 --> 00:13:02.449
But with his protection you
You can find out how big she is;

00:13:02.888 --> 00:13:06.099
It is microscopic,
what a huge proof it is.

00:13:08.118 --> 00:13:11.333
Now you are also
inside that giant

00:13:14.598 --> 00:13:19.133
And what are you
subsidizing in this

00:13:19.758 --> 00:13:23.083
And you have to see
how you are working there.

00:13:24.651 --> 00:13:32.616
(Marathi: NOT CLEAR)

00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:46.666
Virat's upper body from top to
bottom The body parts are places,

00:13:47.406 --> 00:13:50.649
There is a place in the rise,
there is a place above in the rise,

00:13:54.648 --> 00:13:58.508
There is love, everything is
like ours, but much bigger,

00:13:59.178 --> 00:14:04.366
And there is religion in it too, there
is green in it too there is one thing

00:14:08.566 --> 00:14:10.233
And there is
excrement in it too,

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:13.850
There is also
waste pressure in it

00:14:16.458 --> 00:14:19.533
What you people call obstacles
or negativity is also waste.

00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:28.416
And there are two groups in it,
demons also, ghosts also, all of them

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:33.100
are present there. There are ghosts
and demons too. As their status

00:14:33.501 --> 00:14:39.399
increases, Increasingly, they have
been sitting in the upward direction.

00:14:41.478 --> 00:14:44.366
As soon as you cross today,
you are among the gods,

00:14:46.158 --> 00:14:48.033
Now you have become
gods, you are gods,

00:14:49.042 --> 00:14:50.666
You are not a
saint, you are a god.

00:14:51.758 --> 00:14:54.616
Saint means one who is
going to join the deities.

00:14:54.994 --> 00:14:56.883
meaning anytime
you say right now

00:14:58.188 --> 00:15:01.916
But the indifference that I fall into
He is a complete deity, he is a deity.

00:15:02.988 --> 00:15:05.533
And this power
of God is like this,

00:15:08.178 --> 00:15:11.361
That which is the
all-pervading power of God,

00:15:11.467 --> 00:15:13.500
Understand their blood.

00:15:13.983 --> 00:15:18.883
it grows from within them
He also puts his divinity in it.

00:15:21.022 --> 00:15:22.483
They pour blood.

00:15:22.883 --> 00:15:25.716
Adding divinity means
adding anti-body.

00:15:26.456 --> 00:15:28.066
i.e. antibodies

00:15:29.749 --> 00:15:32.233
If we want to talk on human
level then we will say like this

00:15:32.266 --> 00:15:34.316
The antibodies in the
blood are also weak.

00:15:37.056 --> 00:15:44.983
The divinity that is there makes
the blood like this makes it so

00:15:47.073 --> 00:15:48.316
makes subtle

00:15:48.533 --> 00:15:52.699
That it can go deep
inside, inside every cell.

00:15:57.488 --> 00:16:03.166
You are in a situation where you Divinity
should be asked to give you Lakshmi.

00:16:04.533 --> 00:16:08.333
Now you think that you What a great
work I, the mighty power, am doing.

00:16:16.916 --> 00:16:21.455
There are many people like me too who right
now couldn't understand the thing that

00:16:22.211 --> 00:16:23.211
What a big thing it is.

00:16:28.338 --> 00:16:30.955
This is because,
as you guys say,

00:16:31.038 --> 00:16:32.044
It's your love, Ma!

00:16:33.888 --> 00:16:37.733
But more than my illusion,
it is your madness that

00:16:37.916 --> 00:16:43.416
What is the existence of this thing,
you This thing is not being solved.

00:16:44.866 --> 00:16:48.600
And perhaps I have assumed
this body only to save you.

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:55.916
That you believe this thing, not
with your intellect, but with your heart.

00:16:56.449 --> 00:16:59.833
And understand which
place you are sitting.

00:17:02.808 --> 00:17:09.533
What is your form, what
is your condition today.

00:17:11.148 --> 00:17:14.633
As soon as you realize that you are
in this condition today, what happens?

00:17:14.683 --> 00:17:18.100
As soon as you know that today I am king It
has happened, the way of thinking changes;

00:17:20.033 --> 00:17:24.424
its smallness, its
incompleteness, its Madness

00:17:24.448 --> 00:17:28.350
also makes everything
secondary to him.

00:17:28.968 --> 00:17:30.716
Now he is sitting in
the place of the king.

00:17:33.611 --> 00:17:36.802
That Vibrated Cradle is easy
as you people think, but it is

00:17:36.826 --> 00:17:40.016
not so. You people have
worked hard in your previous birth,

00:17:40.382 --> 00:17:42.107
You guys have worked
very hard, You could

00:17:42.131 --> 00:17:44.116
not have come to this
condition without him.

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:45.779
And those whose half
remained incomplete for some

00:17:45.803 --> 00:17:47.683
reason Now they will
have to fulfill it in this life.

00:17:49.399 --> 00:17:51.838
(Unclear...) There are some of
you who are like this. We came

00:17:51.862 --> 00:17:54.300
here after working hard and
this time we crossed, we crossed.

00:17:56.174 --> 00:17:58.115
For some reason, some
people were going half-way.

00:17:58.139 --> 00:17:59.850
For some reason,
but that's also physical.

00:17:59.997 --> 00:18:02.583
But that is also due
to physical reasons.

00:18:03.133 --> 00:18:08.900
We told you his entire
method, his complete know how.

00:18:09.641 --> 00:18:12.533
And we will tell you, I have
come to tell you everything.

00:18:15.369 --> 00:18:16.966
Gonna open up everything,

00:18:18.918 --> 00:18:22.318
But Maya is still
present in many things.

00:18:23.748 --> 00:18:25.908
Now we have received
a letter from a gentleman.

00:18:25.932 --> 00:18:27.950
Near me, they are
very angry with us here,

00:18:27.983 --> 00:18:33.550
The Americans were angry and
went somewhere in Pondicherry.

00:18:33.914 --> 00:18:36.416
There is a man
named Guru Vashishtha

00:18:37.368 --> 00:18:39.350
And he knows
everything about us.

00:18:39.438 --> 00:18:41.257
They all told them for
an hour, they told them

00:18:41.281 --> 00:18:43.100
Said you don't know,
you go and touch his feet

00:18:43.127 --> 00:18:45.050
You haven't understood
from which place they are.

00:18:45.088 --> 00:18:46.349
Now if only he would forgive.

00:18:46.368 --> 00:18:48.016
This is how he told
everything about us.

00:18:48.345 --> 00:18:50.827
But you people will not
accept it, so much As much

00:18:50.851 --> 00:18:53.283
as those people will
accept and understand it;

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.600
There is something
missing in that recognition.

00:18:55.948 --> 00:18:59.833
But as much as you are
internalizing your beliefs

00:18:59.868 --> 00:19:03.016
This means the end
of your civilization.

00:19:04.825 --> 00:19:07.433
You have nothing
to do with that belief,

00:19:07.788 --> 00:19:08.866
To be, to be is nothing,

00:19:09.134 --> 00:19:12.418
The more your eyes are opened,
the more recognition you get.

00:19:13.908 --> 00:19:17.000
How will you believe when
your eyes are not even open?

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:19.902
Therefore, those whose
eyes are open, Wherever

00:19:19.926 --> 00:19:21.566
they are sitting, they
are understanding.

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.250
But your eyes
are partially open,

00:19:25.274 --> 00:19:28.150
Hence the belief that he has.

00:19:30.608 --> 00:19:34.433
Guru Vashishtha who sat in Pondicherry
and came to know us from there,

00:19:35.598 --> 00:19:38.583
Even after sitting in front
of us and knowing us,

00:19:38.628 --> 00:19:40.650
And couldn't understand
even after listening to us

00:19:41.133 --> 00:19:42.936
And he filled the tape
from there If you send

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:44.883
it then tell it to your
mother after knowing it.

00:19:44.907 --> 00:19:47.300
And tell everyone that
mother is this thing,

00:19:47.407 --> 00:19:48.683
And mother is this in person.

00:19:50.306 --> 00:19:51.700
But it is called a wrong raga.

00:19:52.324 --> 00:19:55.000
Because they make rules
for eating and drinking.

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.266
Because his eyes have
been completely opened.

00:19:57.323 --> 00:20:00.500
Because his eyes have
been completely opened.

00:20:00.618 --> 00:20:02.300
What about us?
We are what we are.

00:20:02.561 --> 00:20:04.650
We are not going to change
whether you see it or not.

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:08.866
We are not going to change
if you don't understand.

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:13.899
So how much did you witness?
See how much you have known.

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:17.033
This is also an indication.
This is also a sign.

00:20:17.654 --> 00:20:19.066
This is also a sign.

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:23.083
This is a sign of your asang.

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:29.821
Now you must be
understanding that It was due to

00:20:29.845 --> 00:20:31.866
these vibrations that the
universe was awakened.

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:34.916
Vibrations can be sent
to the entire creation,

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.816
Your aunties go there.

00:20:37.373 --> 00:20:40.393
If we believe in divinity
then Aunty is Bodyj and

00:20:40.417 --> 00:20:43.816
if we believe in demonhood
then we are Aunty Jeanie;

00:20:44.556 --> 00:20:50.583
Aunt Jeanie is a monster, and
Divinity is there, its name is Auntie Bodyz

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:53.066
And the war between
these two also continues.

00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:59.211
You can give this divinity

00:20:59.235 --> 00:21:03.516
flowing in your body,

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:05.250
Normally man cannot give.

00:21:05.916 --> 00:21:08.900
Only those who have received
these vibrations can give,

00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:11.233
And people can't give.

00:21:11.833 --> 00:21:14.716
Therefore understand the
importance of these vibrations.

00:21:16.016 --> 00:21:21.516
these vibrations It is only because
of this that you can give in this world.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:26.800
Before this you could not
give, you could only take;

00:21:27.166 --> 00:21:28.929
Because you took from
nature, creation You

00:21:28.953 --> 00:21:30.716
took it from, after
coming home you took it,

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:35.176
You took it after coming
home, you took it from the sky.

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:39.150
You have taken from all the five
great spirits, and you are living.

00:21:39.174 --> 00:21:43.300
And now you are giving, and
what are you giving â Divinity!

00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:46.199
you have your own element

00:21:46.763 --> 00:21:49.066
Where there are ten Sahaja
Yogis, it has to be given also.

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:55.450
That's why I tell you now You have got
a new vision, there will be new priorities.

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:59.399
You are sitting where the gods are
present, where Hanuman is sitting.

00:22:00.206 --> 00:22:02.016
I can't see you,
what should I do?

00:22:02.607 --> 00:22:04.783
But the one who is
going to see will see it.

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:06.700
All the living beings
are sitting here.

00:22:06.766 --> 00:22:09.616
Everyone is sitting here.
Come with me now, with me.

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:10.833
What's really wrong with you!

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:13.933
Everyone is stationed above you.

00:22:14.852 --> 00:22:16.800
Everyone has come,
Ganesh ji is sitting.

00:22:17.933 --> 00:22:19.600
Everyone is sitting,
in sitting position.

00:22:21.422 --> 00:22:24.700
Everyone is sitting here
and Blessings to you.

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:27.936
I was just wondering how I
appreciate that you come to me like this

00:22:27.936 --> 00:22:31.783
You will be sitting holding hands and yours
Go to Kundilini and open Brahmarandra.

00:22:31.794 --> 00:22:33.776
It's possible, how can it
happen? It cannot happen

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.566
if a man says it, but it
has happened to you.

00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:38.300
the reason for that,

00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:42.930
The reason for this
is that there is divinity

00:22:42.954 --> 00:22:46.666
within you, Tell all you
gods to meditate on this;

00:22:46.833 --> 00:22:50.250
In one meditation, in one
program I am explaining to you.

00:22:50.857 --> 00:22:53.666
If you sit separately and
meditate in your own home

00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:56.483
And say I worship myself
or I meditate on myself

00:22:56.739 --> 00:22:58.316
It won't make any sense,

00:22:58.366 --> 00:23:01.483
I'm telling you because
it's a wake up call.

00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:03.816
And it will be me with Jagrat,

00:23:04.139 --> 00:23:05.883
Everything will happen
only in company.

00:23:05.907 --> 00:23:07.622
In Kalyug, there is
going to be strength

00:23:07.646 --> 00:23:09.716
only in company, this
is a show-off campaign.

00:23:10.766 --> 00:23:14.083
Everyone who has been born in a
different world is not with you today.

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:21.899
Everyone should sit together to do
this Meditate, make lamps, offer prayers;

00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:28.350
If you get a fruit from
something separated,

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:31.375
So you are sitting together, a
thousand times more of these

00:23:31.399 --> 00:23:34.066
things You will get more
results and you will enjoy it.

00:23:35.223 --> 00:23:37.942
I myself saw people who
program every day, every

00:23:37.966 --> 00:23:41.033
time He used to come in,
he went to a great height,

00:23:41.616 --> 00:23:44.015
And those who ever came, no
one came (unclear.. jot) and The

00:23:44.139 --> 00:23:46.700
vibrations of those who never
come are going on in the same way.

00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:50.472
Now you will say Mataji,
we worship you very

00:23:50.496 --> 00:23:53.016
much. Do it, and keep
the photos, there is no use.

00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:58.900
Another thing will have to be given, unless
You will not give your vibrations to people

00:23:59.374 --> 00:24:02.450
You will not know its benefits.

00:24:02.474 --> 00:24:04.766
Because as long as the man
is there, I have to endure it

00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:07.216
many times. Am (unclear- that
Shanspiti Buchi does not come),

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:09.141
I would have someone
with my arm hold her hand.

00:24:09.165 --> 00:24:10.966
Yes, if he is jealous
then I understand him.

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:14.533
The number of times I told you
that your hand will be raised to donate

00:24:15.385 --> 00:24:17.316
That number of times
your Kundilini will rise,

00:24:17.423 --> 00:24:19.116
The more times you
wake up the more,

00:24:19.707 --> 00:24:26.533
The more you get promoted, the more
your game will increase and you will rise.

00:24:27.389 --> 00:24:30.133
It's not your situation,
you come up, no problem,

00:24:30.574 --> 00:24:33.583
But even now those who
know, those who watch Those

00:24:33.607 --> 00:24:36.616
who think that you have
not reached their level,

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:40.850
I challenge you, though. That
you all know about Kundilini,

00:24:41.157 --> 00:24:42.616
You understand everything.

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:44.640
No one knows you
as well as you do;

00:24:44.664 --> 00:24:45.750
neither.

00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:49.283
Even Shankaracharya ji did
not know, although he is very big,

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:50.750
of many people

00:24:51.273 --> 00:24:53.100
You are not even worth
the dust of their feet

00:24:53.124 --> 00:24:54.950
but Even they did not
know as much as you did.

00:24:57.441 --> 00:24:59.400
You know the reason
for that, but only We have

00:24:59.424 --> 00:25:01.383
to go mentally, nothing
has to go internally.

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:03.500
I have to go mentally
because I told you.

00:25:03.524 --> 00:25:06.800
On this finger it comes, on that finger
But it comes, this happens, that happens;

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:09.200
Taught you everything
and made you memorize it.

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:11.743
I read it but from inside,
nothing from inside!

00:25:14.033 --> 00:25:15.666
There is still a lot
to come from within,

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:18.066
It had to be very
clear from inside.

00:25:18.306 --> 00:25:22.206
Some have some wrong ideas,
some have some incompleteness,

00:25:22.446 --> 00:25:24.400
There is something in
someone, it all goes away,

00:25:25.256 --> 00:25:27.300
Because those poor
people did not know anything.

00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:30.621
Whatever he achieved,
he attributed it to his

00:25:30.645 --> 00:25:33.716
hard work. By dedicating
oneself completely.

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:39.116
Your dedication is very,
very, very little. Very sad.

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.876
And that's why you
think to yourself, you

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:46.516
little Can't understand
the C thing vibration

00:25:47.056 --> 00:25:48.722
And that's why you
think to yourself, you

00:25:48.746 --> 00:25:50.583
little Can't understand
the C thing vibration

00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:53.816
Shankaracharya has said
about these vibrations only

00:25:53.906 --> 00:25:56.766
That millions and millions of me
Sometimes it happens to one half man,

00:25:56.773 --> 00:25:59.750
And many people
have one half, he said.

00:25:59.757 --> 00:26:03.200
And those who will survive here when
We'll see if no no no no all the fodder,

00:26:03.224 --> 00:26:05.000
But they will know me,
they will know me And

00:26:05.024 --> 00:26:06.700
then they will say
that this is the thing,

00:26:06.733 --> 00:26:09.533
And what remained there, now in
our times this issue did not exist.

00:26:09.606 --> 00:26:11.933
They will say, you guys
would have said otherwise.

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:14.300
Because your eyes are
still not open from inside.

00:26:14.557 --> 00:26:17.816
The proof is there within you.
You have to know that thing today.

00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:20.255
You have known me
all this mentally, because

00:26:20.279 --> 00:26:22.200
I will explain many
big things to you,

00:26:22.424 --> 00:26:25.982
Because I make you see it
completely, I give you proof of that;

00:26:26.082 --> 00:26:28.932
I tell you things that you heard No
and you look at him saying yes, yes.

00:26:28.956 --> 00:26:32.383
And you look at
him and say yes, yes.

00:26:32.433 --> 00:26:36.155
Mentally you have accepted
me, but not internally. When

00:26:36.179 --> 00:26:40.316
you know me from inside,
you will say that it is like this.

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:44.900
It's a simultaneous thing, as soon as You
will know yourself, you will also know me;

00:26:45.807 --> 00:26:49.133
That's his sign,
that's his sign.

00:26:49.207 --> 00:26:52.233
If a man is blind then you It is
visible that he is going with his grip.

00:26:52.516 --> 00:26:55.816
If a man is walking a little behind you,
you will understand that he is half blind.

00:26:55.833 --> 00:26:59.650
But if someone is walking straight
then it is a sign that he is not blind.

00:27:00.924 --> 00:27:05.700
This is a sign and man is
recognized only by that sign.

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:09.033
This sign itself indicates
that the man is not blind.

00:27:09.173 --> 00:27:14.433
Once it happened that a man said
that I am blind, I cannot see anything;

00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:19.683
And his claim would be made in the
court That they said this man is not blind,

00:27:19.707 --> 00:27:21.566
He can see it and he lies.

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:23.916
So he said, well, how
will it be identified?

00:27:24.156 --> 00:27:26.885
So this is very difficult
it says I can't see

00:27:26.909 --> 00:27:29.950
Gives and you say that
he lies that he is blind.

00:27:30.257 --> 00:27:31.916
So he said how will we know?

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:33.983
So the judge was very
smart, who She immediately

00:27:34.007 --> 00:27:35.700
picked up a hair
and threw it at him,

00:27:36.083 --> 00:27:38.015
So he was not blind, so
he suddenly got hair. He

00:27:38.139 --> 00:27:40.333
caught hold of him and
realized that he was not blind.

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:43.075
This is a sign, that is a sign,

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:46.191
Whatever behavior you people
have, whatever ways, which There is

00:27:46.215 --> 00:27:49.650
also a manner, it is an indication
of how much truth you have spoken.

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:57.466
There is no need for him to
say, No need to tell anyone else.

00:27:57.723 --> 00:28:00.383
This is an inside signal,
and you deceive yourself,

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:02.918
You are playing tricks on
yourself, you are playing tricks

00:28:02.942 --> 00:28:05.050
on yourself You are
arguing, you are after yourself.

00:28:06.773 --> 00:28:10.350
If you leave this, you
don't accept it mentally.

00:28:10.557 --> 00:28:14.616
Flow, flow, raise your heart,

00:28:15.757 --> 00:28:21.916
You will be surprised, but very Subtle,
many things can happen while we are alive,

00:28:22.189 --> 00:28:23.616
Many more can be made.

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:27.833
But never satisfied in this matter
Don't pretend that I have achieved a lot.

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:31.150
Be satisfied with everything
else, it is very important.

00:28:31.423 --> 00:28:34.416
But that's all there is to say,
no, we haven't identified yet.

00:28:34.556 --> 00:28:36.316
He is not yet
realized from within,

00:28:36.707 --> 00:28:39.516
We have not yet known
ourselves, he is satisfied.

00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:44.750
A huge need for awakening from
within Yes, there will be a need to feel.

00:28:45.323 --> 00:28:49.466
And God gave you people I have
searched for that great Manvantar,

00:28:50.357 --> 00:28:57.216
For that great work, which is
called Transformation of Virat.

00:28:57.796 --> 00:29:02.116
To change from one era to another
God has appointed you people.

00:29:02.473 --> 00:29:07.250
You guys will sit on that wheel. That You
people are also moving around on the wheel.
