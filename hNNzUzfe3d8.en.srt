1
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:11,120
Today, we are all here assembled

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,120
in Turkey, in Istanbul,

3
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,960
to celebrate the resurrection of Christ

4
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:27,600
and, with that also, your celebration of your resurrection.

5
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:32,720
Christ’s resurrection was a great message for us.

6
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,320
He won over the death

7
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:47,720
and came out of that dead body

8
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,120
with another body which was living body.

9
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,840
The body was the same, but one was a dead body

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,080
and another one was a body which was living.

11
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,280
It’s not only symbolic, it actually happened within.

12
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:18,760
After all, He was a divine child, He was a divine person.

13
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,960
Actually it has happened within. It’s not just a symbolic thing

14
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:31,480
that He died and He was resurrected into another person

15
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,960
or, you can say, into a living person.

16
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,720
For Him, what is the death? For eternal beings, there are no deaths.

17
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,640
There’s no death for a person who’s eternal.

18
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,880
He may, for the time being, look as if He is dead,

19
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,640
but He can never die.

20
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,760
Christ was like that, a very, very special incarnation,

21
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,720
which came on this earth to be reborn out of the dead.

22
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,040
Now we are also, when we are not yet realized souls,

23
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,360
when we are not yet enlightened.

24
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:29,200
We are also dead in the sense, our awareness is very, very…

25
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:35,880
I should say, absolutely dull and dead.

26
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:41,880
We can see flowers, we can see faces, we can see buildings,

27
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,960
we can see cities, we can see all those things.

28
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,160
All these things we see and we feel we are quite aware,

29
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,920
which we are not.

30
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,800
Actual awareness comes to us

31
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,160
when we cross the limits of our mind,

32
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:03,800
go beyond the mind, and this was only possible

33
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,440
because of the resurrection of Christ.

34
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:13,040
He resurrected Himself because He was a divine person.

35
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:21,360
But also we are resurrected because we are blessed by Divinity.

36
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,840
Now this mind of ours, which is in between,

37
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,520
is controlled by Shri Jesus Christ.

38
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,560
He controls through your Agnya, both the sides.

39
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,360
He controls your conditionings and He controls your ego

40
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,160
and brings a balance in you.

41
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:54,040
But when this Agnya Chakra starts sprinkling,

42
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,920
all sorts of ideas, sometimes reacting,

43
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,200
sometimes accepting conditionings…

44
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:06,320
it is a slave, it is not a free thing,

45
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,720
because it is working under the influence of your ego

46
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,960
or your superego.

47
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:23,040
For that is the death of our awareness,

48
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:29,720
that we cannot, we cannot understand something beyond.

49
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:35,320
That there exists a life beyond this, we cannot accept.

50
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,800
This is… We have seen now

51
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:45,640
that we were all in a condition that one was deadened.

52
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,280
We were feeling bad, we were feeling anxious,

53
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,160
we were fighting and we were thinking:

54
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,560
“There’s something wrong with our present life.”

55
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,280
There’s something definitely which makes us slave,

56
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,040
by which we are slavish.

57
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:11,120
That we realized, no doubt, and we started seeking the Truth.

58
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,760
We started seeking the Truth in so many ways,

59
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:20,520
I know so many were… also went astray,

60
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:28,240
and they lost their balance and have fallen into a complete demise.

61
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,120
But so many of you have been salvaged,

62
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:39,440
have been saved by the great example of Christ’s resurrection.

63
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,120
He had to venture it,

64
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,000
He had to do it and He worked it out.

65
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,240
Without Him, our Agnya would not have been that flexible.

66
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,800
As it is, the human beings

67
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,800
in the olden times were conditioned very much.

68
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,240
And when they have become modern, they are full of ego,

69
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,080
nothing in between.

70
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,800
With these two influences, we are imprisoned,

71
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:13,080
we are absolutely dead people.

72
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,400
We have no sensitivity for anything.

73
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,240
I’ve seen now… even today, you can see

74
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,760
about things are happening across,

75
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:28,000
is people are very anxious to kill each other.

76
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,600
Human beings want to kill human beings, can you imagine?

77
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:38,000
Such a stupid thing that we should kill our kith and kin.

78
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,440
Then, there are children who are killing,

79
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,640
parents that are killing, no relationship is accepted.

80
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:52,800
It’s a sign of a person whose awareness is completely dead.

81
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,840
In our awareness, at least

82
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,320
we should have feelings of compassion and love.

83
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:04,800
But that one is lost, it’s not there, we don’t have it.

84
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,920
The whole world is a flame, when you read about

85
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,120
all the wars that are going on,

86
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,200
the way they are killing children,

87
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,600
the way they are destroying human beings.

88
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,560
It is a wrong attitude

89
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,040
that with destruction of human beings, things will improve.

90
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,840
It’s a very, very wrong concept

91
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,120
that by destroying them, one can achieve something.

92
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,720
Our work in Sahaja Yoga is doing well, I must say,

93
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:48,920
but it has to stop this horrible attitude of human beings

94
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,080
to destroy.

95
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,800
So you might ask then: “What to do, Mother?

96
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,360
What to do to stop this destruction?”

97
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,840
Answer is in the life of Christ.

98
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,920
You resurrect people,

99
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,360
you resurrect them, enlighten them, bring them

100
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,360
to a state where they understand what is right and what is wrong.

101
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:16,880
Let them feel, let them feel the compassion

102
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,680
and love that is within you.

103
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,800
When that starts, that third force within us starts acting,

104
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,720
our ego also comes down,

105
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,760
our conditionings also come down.

106
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,520
For example, if you think: “We are Muslims,

107
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,920
we have a right to kill others”, if you think:

108
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,080
“We are Jews, we have a right to kill others.”

109
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,200
All these differentiations and

110
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,040
this kind of discrimination that we have is so stupid,

111
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,640
because you are human beings,

112
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,560
they are human beings.

113
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,960
You are killing human beings!

114
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,560
Not that they have committed any sin

115
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,640
or they have done anything wrong,

116
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,720
except that, in their foolishness, they believe that

117
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,880
they are this and they are that.

118
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,400
You are not! You are just human beings.

119
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,400
In every human being, as you know very well, there is Kundalini.

120
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,000
There’s no discrimination, everyone,

121
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:31,080
whether you are a Muslim, a Jew, Hindu, Christian, Sikh, Parsee,

122
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,160
anyone, you may call by any name.

123
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:41,600
Now just look at how we accept a certain denomination for ourselves!

124
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,360
You are born, say, to a Christian family

125
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,640
or you are born to a Hindu family:

126
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,240
immediately you start thinking you are there to uphold

127
00:09:53,400 --> 00:10:01,000
all the flags of that religion in which you are born.

128
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,920
You are born in that religion without your knowledge,

129
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:09,000
without your permission, without any understanding.

130
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,440
So how can you belong to that religion?

131
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,480
You have got Kundalini, everybody else has got Kundalini.

132
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,360
So you can only belong to the religion of humanity,

133
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,320
where every human being has got Kundalini.

134
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,560
So, you are nothing but human beings.

135
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,760
All these false ideas, that:

136
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,480
“We are Hindus, we are Muslims, we are Christians”,

137
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:37,880
is all man-created. I mean, man can create anything,

138
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,600
and human beings have no brain to understand

139
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,680
that is all man creating.

140
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,360
For example, you see in America,

141
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:52,320
they create associations and big organizations and all that,

142
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:59,280
based on absolute falsehood, absolute wrong ideas,

143
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,560
absolute destructiveness, but they form it,

144
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,440
they form their groups, they have this, they have…

145
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,240
and they are prospering.

146
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,440
But it has a repercussion, they don’t know.

147
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,240
If you start doing such false things against human beings

148
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:25,200
who are created by God, and nobody can destroy them,

149
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,800
then there are repercussions.

150
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,640
Many, many countries, who were, once upon a time, rulers,

151
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,920
were known as great things, have come down.

152
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,760
And all such countries who now think they are very rich

153
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,760
and all that, will have to come down.

154
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,120
All of them have to come down, is just an ultimate result

155
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:50,400
of this stupidity to believe that you are higher than others,

156
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,760
that you can kill others.

157
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,720
So, a non-violent method started

158
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,280
which is of another absurdity, I think,

159
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:10,040
because then they start saving mosquitoes and also the bugs,

160
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,000
while mosquitoes and bugs are,

161
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:18,520
you must know, are the greatest blood-suckers.

162
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,880
They live only on human blood.

163
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,120
Such things, what’s the use of saving them?

164
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:33,680
So, human beings take to something that is absurd, stupid, foolish.

165
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,360
I don’t know what is the reason.

166
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:41,080
The way they accept things is absolutely unbelievable.

167
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,920
I think it is a kind of a slavish mentality

168
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,680
which does not give them freedom

169
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,040
to think what is right, what is wrong.

170
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,040
For this, we have Christ. We have Christ, a person

171
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,200
who was absolutely free,

172
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,560
free from all kinds of prejudices,

173
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,160
all kinds of temptations,

174
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,960
all kinds of nonsense that human beings follow.

175
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,960
But one may say that: “Mother, after all, He was divine!”

176
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,000
He was divine and now you are made divine also.

177
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:27,600
So, how can we now join together to make a full effort,

178
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,480
a full effort, to tell people that:

179
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:38,240
“What are you doing? Why are you doing it?

180
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,040
What is the need to do such things?”

181
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,640
On one side is, we can say, a mass destruction

182
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:52,280
through stupidity, another side is your own self-destruction.

183
00:13:53,840 --> 00:14:00,480
Take to drinking, take to other self-destructive things

184
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,400
which are immoral,

185
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:07,640
that’s very easily available, and people like it very much.

186
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:13,040
They don’t like when you talk that: “This is destructive.”

187
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,880
So, either we destroy others or destroy ourselves.

188
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:24,320
Christ was destroyed by others and He resurrected by Himself.

189
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,160
So we are also in the same position now.

190
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,400
I know many a times Sahaja Yoga was challenged.

191
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,040
Now it’s much better, not so bad…

192
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,320
was challenged and there were so many problems.

193
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,360
But now it’s smoothing down,

194
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,840
because that’s the Truth, that’s the Reality,

195
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
that’s what is Divinity.

196
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,640
So, you should not be afraid.

197
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:55,320
All these funny ideas about Sahaja Yoga also will die out.

198
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:00,000
It’s a resurrection, not only of you people,

199
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,720
but also of your ideologies.

200
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,000
Now the ideologies change,

201
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:11,280
that our awareness should be enlightened.

202
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,080
We should have light in our awareness.

203
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,400
This has come suddenly through Sahaja Yoga to people, that:

204
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,520
“If you don’t have the light,

205
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:25,040
how can you go further in the right path?”

206
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:30,000
It’s not easy to describe Christ’s life, how He went through that.

207
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,680
He died so young and brutally He was killed.

208
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,600
But still all that, He resurrected Himself.

209
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:44,840
He came out of all that, came out of that ordeal.

210
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,640
So for us also, when we are in Sahaja Yoga problems,

211
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,760
we should know we have a power to resurrect ourselves.

212
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,960
No one can destroy us! No one can finish us off,

213
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:00,240
because we have a power to resurrect ourselves.

214
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,520
This special power that we have to resurrect,

215
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:09,160
you should all the time understand and feel it and meditate on that.

216
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,560
I hear from people from every country:

217
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,160
“The government is doing like this,

218
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,840
the government is doing like this!”

219
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,520
or they are having some trouble,

220
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,240
they call you a sect, they call you this and that…

221
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,640
Alright, doesn’t matter!

222
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,840
Your duty is to believe

223
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,160
that you are following the footsteps of Christ.

224
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,000
And no one can destroy it!

225
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,720
This is the message of Christ’s life,

226
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,880
that divine life cannot be destroyed.

227
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,120
When this body could not be destroyed,

228
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:47,440
then how can you destroy the divine light in Him?

229
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,600
So many Sahaja Yogis are here,

230
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,880
who have been since long in Sahaja Yoga,

231
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,840
and they have had problems,

232
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,960
and they went through lot of troubles, I agree!

233
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,000
But all these things have subsided.

234
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:04,280
And now you are in such a resurrected position

235
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,160
that, after some time, -you’ll be amazed-

236
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:12,360
Sahaja Yoga will take over, all over the world.

237
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,600
All over the world, people will take to Sahaja Yoga

238
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,720
and we’ll have such a lot of Sahaja Yogis all over the world

239
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:25,840
that all this minority of some stupid people will disappear.

240
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,880
For that, what have you to do? Sometimes, people ask Me:

241
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:34,160
“What do we have to do?” You must have also read the Bible,

242
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,960
that Christ prayed and He was praying.

243
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,920
In the same way, we can say, we have to meditate.

244
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,040
Through meditation, we’ll grow in our awareness,

245
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:52,880
in our new personality, in our strengthened personality.

246
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,120
Meditation is the only way we can grow,

247
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,440
and then no one can destroy you,

248
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,080
because you are all protected by the Divine Love.

249
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,400
You don’t have to worry

250
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,280
as to who will destroy you, what will happen.

251
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,440
Of course, in the beginning there’s little agitation,

252
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,320
people feel a little bad about it, it’s alright!

253
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:17,560
But actually, NO ONE can destroy you.

254
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,640
Have this faith in you!

255
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,160
Christ had no organization;

256
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,880
He had no Adi Shakti to support Him, in no way.

257
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:31,320
But only through His divine personality,

258
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,400
He managed to get out of all the problems,

259
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:40,200
of all the tortures, of all the atrocities on Him.

260
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,040
So now, you have better advantage,

261
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,960
because you are enlightened.

262
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,920
Firstly, He was a divine person and He could go through that.

263
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,760
You don’t have to!

264
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,000
Nobody will torture you, nobody will put you in jail,

265
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,960
nobody will crucify you.

266
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,600
Nobody will, that’s not possible.

267
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:03,680
But mentally, if you are upset, sometimes you get upset I know,

268
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,280
in certain countries people get upset,

269
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,600
because they think they are oppressed because they are in Sahaja Yoga.

270
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,440
I assure you, no one can do that.

271
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:19,960
You must know that you are all the time protected.

272
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,640
Christ is there as your elder brother, I always said that.

273
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,160
But also you have your Mother,

274
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,360
and you have all the Ganas and all the Angels around you.

275
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,800
When I see this, I just thought: “Look at this,

276
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:42,240
in every country they have shown Angels and Ganas are there!”

277
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,080
Such pure forms of protection you have.

278
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,280
So there’s nothing to worry about

279
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,640
your destruction or your impediments,

280
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,480
or whatever you may call it,

281
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:01,480
a kind of destructive forces acting on you.

282
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:07,480
From the life of Christ, you have to know that no one can destroy

283
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:11,160
a realised soul in these modern times.

284
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,240
As it is, they never destroyed.

285
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,680
We had so many Saints who were killed, who were tortured,

286
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,120
but see, they still exist as poetry, as poems,

287
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:30,560
also as blessings, everywhere they are not finished.

288
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,200
They are not dead, though it seems that they are no more,

289
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:41,880
but even to take their names and even to call them, they work out.

290
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:46,000
They are there in their Spirit and they help.

291
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,440
Assured by Christ’s life,

292
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,680
by His resurrection, we are resurrected people.

293
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,400
Of course, our body also has changed.

294
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:02,760
After resurrection, you know that your Chakras work out

295
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:06,600
all the curing and all the blessings.

296
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,320
Our attitude, our mental attitude also changes,

297
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,440
and also your ego subsides.

298
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,800
Not only that, also our conditionings go out.

299
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,200
Specially I was so happy that those people, say,

300
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,560
who are born in a particular religion,

301
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,080
immediately they see what’s wrong with that religion,

302
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:32,440
as if they turn round and see the image of their society

303
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,360
and know what’s wrong with them.

304
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:40,240
And when they start meditating on those corrections,

305
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,120
it works, societies are improving.

306
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:49,120
You see, so-called religious ideas are falling into their own traps,

307
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,400
and they will all fall because they’re falsehood.

308
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,120
That’s not real religion.

309
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,640
The religion is within ourselves and this pure religion

310
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,280
is the one which is a global religion.

311
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,920
The solution comes like that: supposing you have wars…

312
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,960
wars in the name of religion,

313
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,600
in the name of God specially.

314
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,920
And in the name of religions they have wars.

315
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,400
So now, what happens?

316
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:31,840
All these wars that take place cannot destroy Reality,

317
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,040
cannot destroy the Truth.

318
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,520
This is another message of Christ’s resurrection.

319
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,040
You cannot!

320
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,440
You may think that today you have destroyed these people,

321
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,400
but they are there.

322
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:50,400
All the Saints, all the great people

323
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:57,280
who have been resurrected in life are all the time there.

324
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,840
Their protections are there, their guidance is there,

325
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,000
you can see them in a way that they are there.

326
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:14,960
So one should have no fear. The fear of death has to go.

327
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,360
So many of them have said the same

328
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,360
that: “What is death after all?”

329
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:24,160
Death dies itself, once you are resurrected.

330
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,080
So one should not be afraid of death.

331
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,800
Now how many of you have been afraid of death

332
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,400
before your resurrection, but not now?

333
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:38,120
You are not bothered as to when the death comes, what happens

334
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:42,840
or which way you are going to be so-called destroyed.

335
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,080
You know you cannot be destroyed.

336
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,360
In your heart of hearts, you all know this very well,

337
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:52,040
that you cannot be destroyed.

338
00:23:52,800 --> 00:24:00,960
The fear of our destruction goes away, no doubt.

339
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:05,160
But there is one thing, is the compassion.

340
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,480
When you see all these bad things are happening

341
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:13,320
and people are being tortured, your mind is… you see…

342
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,720
cannot take it for granted.

343
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:20,480
It starts responding to that,

344
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:26,120
and it feels the pain of others, tremendous!

345
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:30,920
But as a result of that, your will power,

346
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,800
your thinking on those lines, your tears even are powerful

347
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,040
and they can bring solace to those people

348
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,480
who are suffering unnecessarily.

349
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:46,360
You have to experiment with it.

350
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:57,240
Just having a feeling of compassion and love, things will improve.

351
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,560
Now, as it is, we meditate.

352
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:07,040
But we can meditate also with such compassion

353
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:13,640
and such love that your tears can also have an effect

354
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,200
on these people who are so cruel

355
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:20,200
and stupid and killing each other.

356
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,320
But it is important for you to know that now

357
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,880
you are not an individual, but you have become a global personality,

358
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,280
a global personality.

359
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,680
You are not an individual, you are a global personality,

360
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:42,040
and sitting down here, you are working out all the global problems.

361
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,960
You are not a small person now,

362
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,160
who’s only worried about your own children,

363
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:50,680
about your family, about this and that, no!

364
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:55,520
This mind of yours has expanded, expanded like this,

365
00:25:55,680 --> 00:26:02,160
that it works automatically for all the problems of the world.

366
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,000
When for a woman I read newspapers,

367
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,880
specially women seldom read newspapers,

368
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,520
they think it's stupidity to read those papers.

369
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:16,440
But I read, I read and I read those where My attention is in it.

370
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:21,120
I’ve seen it works! But all of you put together, if you understand

371
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,520
that this is your responsibility to correct

372
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:30,800
all the destructive forces, to put them right,

373
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,160
we just have to collectively meditate on the points

374
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:39,120
where you find there’s a big problem.

375
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:43,920
Now the problem mainly is because of religions, mainly.

376
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,480
Now, if they can all jump into the new religion,

377
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,920
global religion, they all are one.

378
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,480
They cannot then fight because there’s one religion.

379
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,680
But they don’t want to have one religion,

380
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,520
because they want to fight. They’re fighting cocks.

381
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:05,800
But if they come to Sahaj, if they become enlightened,

382
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,640
then they will only enjoy love of each other

383
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:14,600
and not killing of each other, destruction of others.

384
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,960
And this is what we have to learn from life of Christ,

385
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,880
who was alone, who was single.

386
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,400
He did not have such a collective behind Him.

387
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:27,840
But how powerful He was that He fought the death

388
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,720
and came out of it so clearly at the stage of Agnya!

389
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,240
Without Him, we could not have worked out Sahaja Yoga.

390
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,680
Kundalini would not have gone through,

391
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,400
unless and until He had sacrificed His life.

392
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,400
And He readily sacrificed,

393
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:48,440
He accepted the task of sacrificing His life,

394
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,520
and then resurrected.

395
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,640
He passed through that, I should say,

396
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,200
a very constricted channel of Agnya,

397
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:04,640
to put you people right, by saying: “You forgive everyone.”

398
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,480
If forgiving was such a powerful thing

399
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:11,600
that you can even fight your death, then why not forgive?

400
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,160
Many people say: “Mother, we can’t forgive!”

401
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,840
and I’ve told hundred times that:

402
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,360
“What are you doing if not forgiving?”

403
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,200
So, the message of Christ’s life is that He forgot,

404
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,280
forgave all the people who troubled Him.

405
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,720
Even He said that: “O God, please forgive them,

406
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,400
because they don’t know what they are doing!”

407
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:38,520
On the cross, He said those things, when He was tortured, insulted,

408
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,240
He’s saying what? “You forgive them,

409
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,520
have pity, have sympathy for them,

410
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,880
because they don’t know what they are doing!” They are killing

411
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,840
the Son of God, and what will happen to them?

412
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,480
Where will they go? What will be their situation?

413
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:03,480
This one is a big message for us,

414
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:07,520
that even on the cross, He said: “Forgive,

415
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:11,440
O God, O Father, forgive them!”

416
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,520
In the same way, we have to also forgive people.

417
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:21,400
It’s very important from the life of Christ that we have to forgive.

418
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:27,200
His forgiveness was of the greatest importance.

419
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,360
For the whole world to understand, you must forgive.

420
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,360
If you learn how to forgive, you’ll be amazed,

421
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,840
half of the wars of this world will be finished!

422
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,120
Now, something happened thousands of years back.

423
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:44,400
Still people are fighting, still they are fighting,

424
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,160
thinking these things happened so many years back,

425
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,960
so they are our ennemies.

426
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,640
If He can really forgive those people,

427
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:59,920
what happened before we were even born,

428
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:05,440
why should we form a group of such people, why?

429
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:10,760
Because there is something called hatred in human beings,

430
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:15,560
they have hatred, hatred for this, hatred for that,

431
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,880
even in small things they’ll say: “I don’t like it, I like it!”

432
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,440
It’s very common,

433
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,120
nowadays specially.

434
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,080
When we were young, we were not supposed to say such a thing:

435
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,560
“I don’t like it, I like it!”,

436
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,480
we were not supposed to say.

437
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:41,400
But now their freedom has given them to talk like this:

438
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,920
“I don’t like it, I don’t like that,

439
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:49,440
I don’t like that, I don’t like that person!” Who are you?

440
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,720
What do you think of yourself to judge others?

441
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,840
You don’t know how to appreciate,

442
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,840
you don’t know how to enjoy

443
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,600
and only what you go on is: “I don’t like it!”

444
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,520
And supposing you like it, what will you do?

445
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:08,040
Whether you like it or don’t like is just the same!

446
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,080
But just to show off their ego, we say:

447
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:16,480
“I don’t like this way, I don’t like!”

448
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,440
Because there’s no love!

449
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:26,680
If there is love, then you can enjoy everything.

450
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:30,560
We’ll never say: “I don’t like it, I like it!”

451
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:37,440
You will definitely enjoy if you really say

452
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,440
that: “I enjoy, I enjoy everything!”

453
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,280
You are closing down yourself by saying:

454
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,640
“I don’t like it, I don’t like it, I don’t like!”

455
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,840
as if you are a great connoisseur,

456
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,800
or a person, a judge, to say this!

457
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:01,160
It is very remarkable that in the West it’s even more prominent

458
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,840
that they will say: “I don’t like it, I don’t like!”

459
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,960
Of course, in the East, I would say in India,

460
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,120
if somebody says like that, people will say

461
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,440
he’s just trying to show off. On the face!

462
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:20,800
But showing off is not regarded as bad manners.

463
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,800
It’s not regarded as bad manners in the West.

464
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:28,440
To feel shy of anything is regarded as bad manners,

465
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:35,800
but to boast of something, nobody feels that it is a bad thing.

466
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:39,760
Did Christ boast of anything? Never!

467
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:43,080
He never boasted of anything,

468
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:51,160
but when He saw people were selling things in the holy places,

469
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,920
what did He do?

470
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:56,280
He started beating them with a hunter,

471
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:59,280
because that was wrong, absolutely wrong,

472
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,560
against the holiness of the place.

473
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,200
But He did not say: “I don’t like it!” No!

474
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:12,360
He just showed His complete disapproval

475
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,720
of the whole system of selling things

476
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:20,760
in the temple or in a holy place.

477
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,600
People go there to worship.

478
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:30,400
They need a mind which is devoid of money orientation.

479
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:39,800
There should be no money orientation when you are meditating.

480
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:43,360
This is the biggest problem of today.

481
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,920
Everything is money orientation.

482
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:53,120
You like a car which is very expensive, so you want to have.

483
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,600
By hook and crook, you will get that car and sit in there.

484
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:04,000
You might be a thief, but you buy an expensive car to show off,

485
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,360
perhaps maybe because you are a thief, that’s why you want to hide

486
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,640
your personality.

487
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,640
So there is no truthful life, it’s all just showing off

488
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,960
and thinking no end of yourself.

489
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:24,120
But when the death will come at your doorstep, what will you do?

490
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:29,600
At that time, you will be trembling

491
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,080
with all your so-called achievements

492
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,000
and your so-called showing off.

493
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:38,960
You will just tremble before death.

494
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:42,480
But a Sahaja Yogi cannot!

495
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:47,560
He will like, if the death has to come, it has to come!

496
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:53,320
He will not tremble that the death is something dangerous,

497
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:56,640
but is a place where he can go and rest.

498
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,080
He won’t mind, he won’t mind anything,

499
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:05,480
because he is above that, he is above destruction.

500
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:08,880
So, he won’t mind anything, whatever comes his way

501
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,600
and he will surrender to it easily.

502
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,440
We have Kabir. Kabir has written so many poems,

503
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:22,560
mostly about death.

504
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,560
He said: “When death came, I didn’t say a single word,

505
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:31,000
I didn’t fight, but what I did,

506
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:37,520
I took a sheet on top of me and went off to sleep!”

507
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,560
How sweetly he described death sometimes,

508
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,600
and Kabir then reminds Me of Christ.

509
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,960
How sweetly Christ also went through all these things,

510
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:58,280
and when He died, the whole elements shook.

511
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,200
He was the master of elements.

512
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,600
They shook,

513
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:07,080
there was earthquake and all kinds of things that happened.

514
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:11,800
They, they felt His death, not Him!

515
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:16,120
They felt that such a great divinity

516
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:24,840
which is the essence of existence has been killed like this.

517
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,880
They also didn’t know that He is going to come back to His life.

518
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,000
They also were not aware of it, but He did.

519
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:37,160
He did come out of that deadening thing, for which

520
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:41,680
everybody was so much shocked.

521
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:48,000
His death itself gives us strength,

522
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,960
that we have no death, we have resurrected

523
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:56,360
and resurrection is with us.

524
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,360
But we have to establish,

525
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:03,480
we have to establish our Sahaja Yoga, our meditation.

526
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,320
That’s very important.

527
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,120
The other day, I met a lady.

528
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:13,400
She told of a miracle in her life, how she was saved.

529
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:19,040
She was about to die, she came across an accident, all kind…

530
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:23,480
But how she was saved, while her husband,

531
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,880
he succumbs to all kinds of things. So I said:

532
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,480
“What do you mean, how it happened?” She said:

533
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:33,160
“Mother, it’s nothing but Shraddha!”

534
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:38,280
Shraddha is dedication, surrendering.

535
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:43,600
“Surrendering, because I’m surrendered!”

536
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:48,040
But I said: “How?” “That, I don’t know, I’m just surrendered.

537
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:54,400
I feel so comfortable, so lively and so much out of fear

538
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,760
when I know I’m surrendered,

539
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,880
completely surrendered to my Spirit!”

540
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,440
And this what it is what we have to learn

541
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,880
when we meditate, that we have to surrender.

542
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:09,560
Muhammad has called “Islam”. Islam means surrender,

543
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,720
though they don’t surrender -otherwise you see…-

544
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,600
but what is that you must surrender

545
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:21,800
to your global nature, to your higher nature.

546
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,360
You must not die out,

547
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,600
you must not fizzle out

548
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,880
into these worldly turmoil and worldly things.

549
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:38,720
It’s a very strength-giving example of Christ.

550
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,840
And He’s with us, He will always guide us, He’ll look after us,

551
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,880
not only but He’ll give us strength.

552
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:53,000
He will destroy all those who will be against eternal life.

553
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,200
He’ll destroy nonsensical things.

554
00:38:55,360 --> 00:39:00,280
And you are seeing now how in Kali Yuga all these institutions

555
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:05,120
who talk of religion and fights are getting destroyed.

556
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,960
Automatically, we have done nothing.

557
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:12,440
On their own only, while they’re doing, they are finishing,

558
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:16,880
because there’s no Reality, there’s no Spirit in it,

559
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:22,920
and without the Spirit, what is left is nothing but a dead body.

560
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:28,120
The whole understanding should be for Sahaja Yogis,

561
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:32,520
that we have to be Spirit-oriented,

562
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:38,440
not money-oriented, body-oriented, emotion-oriented,

563
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,640
but Spirit-oriented,

564
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,080
which is a joy-giving thing.

565
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:46,840
And you’ll be surprised with that orientation,

566
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:55,280
you will be the most happy, most loving,

567
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,760
most beautiful person.

568
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,160
Immediately, people will know around

569
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,320
that there’s something about this man, some spark

570
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:11,800
about this lady, some sort of a spark that she is or he is

571
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:18,080
so much different from us. It can be recognized in no time.

572
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:24,360
Now, at the time of Christ, very few people could recognize,

573
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,720
because they were not enlightened,

574
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:35,000
because they were very much below the level of human beings,

575
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,880
I should say. But you are not!

576
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:42,040
You are quite aware, you are born in modern times,

577
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,960
and at this time, when we think of Christ,

578
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,480
we should know what a life it was,

579
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:50,960
what a grand personality it was,

580
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:54,720
that He subjected to this kind of a torture.

581
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,480
He could have destroyed all of them in no time.

582
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:01,480
He was so powerful, such a powerful personality,

583
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:05,880
but He did not! He forgave them.

584
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,720
He gave you the message of forgiveness,

585
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,640
the greatest force that can work out.

586
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,160
Now also, you should surrender yourself

587
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:19,480
to this idea of forgiveness and really try to forgive.

588
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:23,320
You’ll be amazed, you will feel very much peaceful, very happy,

589
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:28,400
and the person who has tortured you will come round.

590
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:33,640
What we have to do is now to transform people. That’s our job.

591
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,400
We have to transform them. We are transformed.

592
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,440
We are at a point, we can call it, we are resurrected.

593
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,880
We have to resurrect the whole world, that’s our job,

594
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:46,400
so that all these fights, all these quarrels,

595
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:50,920
all these falsehoods will just be finished.

596
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:54,800
For us, Christ is our leader, who has done this for us.

597
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,720
He came as an ordinary human being,

598
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,800
lived like an ordinary human being,

599
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,360
with all these powers within Him.

600
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,800
He never used them to destroy.

601
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:08,720
In the same way, we can also with love and affection,

602
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:13,680
we can also really come out of our deaths,

603
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:16,080
come out of our misgivings,

604
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,560
come out of our destructive nature.

605
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:26,080
This destructive nature is the most dangerous thing for Yogis.

606
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:32,800
That’s the only hope we have, that Sahaja Yogis are resurrected.

607
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,280
Only thing I know is that,

608
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:42,240
if we have so many Sahaja Yogis, this world will change.

609
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,080
This world has to change.

610
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,560
But your progress should go on,

611
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:51,360
you should progress more and more, not you should not regress back.

612
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,240
For small things here and there, don’t worry!

613
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,160
You have a very great responsibility,

614
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:02,640
and that responsibility is to transform the human beings.

615
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:07,720
That’s your due. How many have you transformed?

616
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:13,080
How many have you changed? It’s all right for men or women.

617
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:16,400
You have to change people, this is your job

618
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:20,080
and this is the power you have got from Christ,

619
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,400
that you have to change them, transform them

620
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:26,960
into the new world of happiness and joy

621
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:33,400
which we call it as the Sahaj Nirmal Dharma.

622
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:37,240
If it works out, if it really works out,

623
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:42,120
think of the world, how beautiful it will become for us!

624
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,880
It’s the duty of every Sahaja Yogi

625
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:50,160
to go into this kind of a new venture

626
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:55,400
and try to find out how many people he can convert

627
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:58,480
and how many people he can bring round.

628
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:02,400
I hope next time we’ll have doubled the number of people

629
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:06,720
that are here from all these eight countries who are hosting now.

630
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,200
All My love to you all.

631
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:13,840
Great days are waiting us.

632
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,720
We have to now understand only our responsibility.

633
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:23,400
Main thing is how many people we have converted,

634
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,920
how many people we have resurrected.

635
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,720
That is the record, not what,

636
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,120
how many Pujas you have attended and all that.

637
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,560
It’s not so important.

638
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:36,200
Pujas are just to give you strength and to give you power,

639
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:40,400
but they are not your work. That’s not your work.

640
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,920
For your work, you can take from Pujas

641
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,800
all the strength that you need.

642
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:50,320
But if you don’t use this power, then what’s the use?

643
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,440
So now, I leave it to you to remember

644
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:57,360
that you are resurrected and you have to resurrect others.

645
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,800
It’s a very, very important job

646
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:04,480
at this time of complete turmoil and destruction.

647
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,320
May God bless you!
