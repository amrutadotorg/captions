00:12:27.437 --> 00:12:36.437
I thank you very much, all of you, for coming
over for a small meeting that we are going

00:12:40.837 --> 00:12:55.637
to have and, it's very important for you people
who are responsible in life to understand

00:12:56.637 --> 00:13:04.637
what is the work of Sahaja Yoga and how important
it is. I mean, now we have people all over

00:13:04.803 --> 00:13:14.572
the world, it's working in 85 countries. In
a country like Benin we have twenty thousand

00:13:14.637 --> 00:13:21.637
sahaja yogis.
All this is...why? Because people are trying

00:13:23.676 --> 00:13:30.046
to find the truth, they are not satisfied
with whatever they know. They want to know

00:13:30.046 --> 00:13:37.046
what is beyond and I started this work long
time back. I think I have worked in England

00:13:41.046 --> 00:13:48.046
for at least 25 years. But, unfortunately,
England is nowhere compared to other countries.

00:13:50.756 --> 00:13:57.756
Even Austria has ten times more people, Austria
and Germany. What's the reason? I think the

00:14:01.436 --> 00:14:08.436
newspapers. Your newspapers are not responsible,
they are not at all responsible. Some may

00:14:09.847 --> 00:14:15.717
be, I am not saying all of them.
But the newspapers that I have seen here,

00:14:15.717 --> 00:14:21.217
they never come and ask me anything, they
never try to find out if there's anything

00:14:21.217 --> 00:14:27.807
I'm doing that is good for people, which is
essential, which has to be worked out. But

00:14:27.807 --> 00:14:34.807
somehow they take the very negative side.
This is the main reason why people are lagging

00:14:36.007 --> 00:14:43.007
behind in knowing the truth. I'm sorry to
say that. I have written in my book also that

00:14:47.087 --> 00:14:53.897
you have to be more responsible.
Actually newspapers are now even more important

00:14:53.897 --> 00:15:00.897
than any political party or any, I should
say, kingdom or anything. They have achieved

00:15:01.116 --> 00:15:08.116
that power by their sense, by their honesty,
by their steadfastness, their sense of honour.

00:15:09.416 --> 00:15:15.067
I must say that we got our freedom in India
because the newspapers of England. They are

00:15:15.067 --> 00:15:22.067
the ones who wrote the truth about us. They
are the ones who told how atrocities were

00:15:22.557 --> 00:15:28.687
worked out on India. It's only they who have
really helped us.

00:15:28.687 --> 00:15:34.507
I mean I cannot understand what has happened
to today's newspapers as they are. Specially

00:15:34.507 --> 00:15:41.507
I am meaning the newspaper that I have seen,
which is absolutely nonsensical (reference

00:15:41.606 --> 00:15:42.027
to 'The Independent' newspaper which had recently
published a negative and incorrect article).

00:15:42.027 --> 00:15:49.027
It is talking about money. Doesn't talk about
what good it (Sahaja Yoga) has done. Now I

00:15:51.267 --> 00:15:58.267
must tell you I have not taken a single pie
in England. Never! It is only when they came

00:16:00.457 --> 00:16:07.457
to India they had to pay for their stay there.
They had to pay, also, in Italy for their

00:16:08.536 --> 00:16:15.536
stay there. And whatever remains I used to
use. I have used my money for 20 years. Last

00:16:16.676 --> 00:16:23.676
10 years since my husband is retired I'm using
this money. The houses that I have are all

00:16:24.197 --> 00:16:30.966
of my money. Imagine these people, they should
have come and asked me before doing. It's

00:16:30.966 --> 00:16:37.966
criminal to be like that. The problem now
in England is that they have developed a great

00:16:40.026 --> 00:16:47.026
sense of criticism. Just criticise! Now we
have critics of the critics in this country.

00:16:48.067 --> 00:16:50.726
But whom are you criticising?

00:16:50.726 --> 00:16:57.726
Nobody is creating anything. Have you got
those old writers of England who were respected?

00:17:00.267 --> 00:17:07.267
Have you got that level of novelist that existed?
Is there any, any person who can write like

00:17:18.147 --> 00:17:25.147
those great writers? I have read them and
I know. I have great respect for them but

00:17:28.156 --> 00:17:35.156
were they just the lotuses in a pond, who
were so great. They are the ones who established

00:17:37.526 --> 00:17:44.526
democracy here. They are the ones who brought
such beautiful ideas to the whole world and

00:17:46.986 --> 00:17:53.986
what are we doing now? What are we spreading?
All kind of malignant stuff.

00:17:55.897 --> 00:18:00.887
I have never studied English in my school
because my father was a freedom fighter and

00:18:00.887 --> 00:18:07.036
he said "No, you have to go into an Indian
school" Afterwards, also, I never studied

00:18:07.036 --> 00:18:14.036
because I was a medical student. But only
reading these things we Indians still respect

00:18:17.226 --> 00:18:24.226
you. Because of their intelligence, because
of their clear headedness and also the [sense

00:18:25.147 --> 00:18:31.377
of] justice they had. That's all missing nowadays
in the intellectual people. I was surprised

00:18:31.377 --> 00:18:37.586
to read in this newspaper all non-sensical
things, given by one boy who is just a teacher,

00:18:37.586 --> 00:18:44.586
while Sahaja Yoga is working in 85 countries
and we have scholars and we have great writers,

00:18:46.116 --> 00:18:53.116
all sorts of things we have here, and here
one boy, who is just a teacher somewhere...I

00:18:54.387 --> 00:19:00.286
am sure he doesn't do it on his own. How can
he afford?

00:19:00.286 --> 00:19:07.286
There are only six people who are working
against us. We could have really put them

00:19:08.776 --> 00:19:15.776
into jail but we didn't want to. Because they
did something very wrong. Sahaja Yoga is a

00:19:17.397 --> 00:19:24.397
very moral society and if they are immoral
we don't want them there. That's all! That's

00:19:24.666 --> 00:19:31.346
the freedom we have. That's the independence
we have that we don't want to have immoral

00:19:31.346 --> 00:19:38.346
people living in Sahaja Yoga. What's wrong
in that? We believe in morality and without

00:19:39.536 --> 00:19:46.536
morality our countries cannot improve. It's
very surprising. They had some IQ. I used

00:19:50.957 --> 00:19:57.957
to think they'll have some, also, some heart
but doesn't seem so. And after that now there

00:20:01.856 --> 00:20:07.536
is also SQ, is the 'spiritual coefficience',
which you can achieve in Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:07.536 --> 00:20:14.536
You don't know what heights you can go to.
But having such stupid things, by one man

00:20:15.296 --> 00:20:21.767
coming and telling you something. And how
cunning it was that it was just done before

00:20:21.767 --> 00:20:27.036
my program. Why? Why are they doing it? What
is the advantage? What are people going to

00:20:27.036 --> 00:20:34.036
gain by that? First time I'm saying this.
I should have said this much earlier I think.

00:20:34.926 --> 00:20:41.926
What is the achievement? Why do you write
all those things which are nonsensical? Which

00:20:42.036 --> 00:20:49.036
are false. Absolutely false. Why? Is that
racialism? what is it? I can't find out. I

00:20:55.327 --> 00:21:02.327
can't find out the reason why these people
are listening to one man who is just a teacher

00:21:02.567 --> 00:21:09.567
somewhere and writing all falsehood.
We can pull them in the court no doubt, but

00:21:09.616 --> 00:21:16.616
we don't want to, because it's an open thing.
If you want your Self-realisation we are here

00:21:18.236 --> 00:21:25.236
to give you. There's no force on anybody,
there's no compulsion on anybody. On the contrary

00:21:25.567 --> 00:21:32.567
we are anxious to throw away so many from
Sahaja Yoga! There's a code of conduct, no

00:21:35.267 --> 00:21:42.267
doubt.
We have marriages which are very legal and

00:21:42.437 --> 00:21:49.437
at the most 1% fail. We are very loving couples,
beautiful children and a very beautiful society.

00:21:56.086 --> 00:22:03.086
One has to understand that you don't have
that. You have to get to it. What do you have

00:22:06.486 --> 00:22:12.336
to sacrifice? Nothing. It's absolutely free.
My lectures are free. Self-realisation is

00:22:12.336 --> 00:22:19.336
free. Now what else? We should offer them,
I think, some tea also free then it would

00:22:20.497 --> 00:22:27.257
be better! That's, I mean, I don't know why
in England where we had such great people

00:22:27.257 --> 00:22:34.257
right from Shakespeare. Think of them. I can't
understand.

00:22:35.267 --> 00:22:41.466
Shakespeare I call him an avadhuta, means
a person who was beyond and was trying to

00:22:41.466 --> 00:22:48.466
show all kinds of human enterprises as failures.
Just to show that to make them detached. Such

00:22:50.947 --> 00:22:57.947
a great sage like him was born in this country
of yours. But if there are false gurus that's

00:23:01.406 --> 00:23:05.296
the best! If somebody tells you lies is the
best!

00:23:05.296 --> 00:23:12.296
What is the matter? Where are people going?
In a way it's good that I saw this article.

00:23:17.237 --> 00:23:22.697
And all falsehood! About Hitler what I have
said I've brought the book. What I've said

00:23:22.697 --> 00:23:29.697
was that...you can read it out. It's very
interesting to see what I have said it. Can

00:23:30.136 --> 00:23:37.136
you?
Also today I saw very nice article in the

00:23:41.597 --> 00:23:48.597
magazine they gave 'Culture' that what do
we owe to Germans and Beethoven, because of

00:23:48.857 --> 00:23:55.857
him and all that. Such a beautiful article.
But who will read that? I think better read

00:23:58.597 --> 00:24:04.317
it out so that it's cleared out! My memory's
very good, that's the trouble!

00:24:04.317 --> 00:24:11.077
Derek Lee: "So there was a reference in the
recent article in 'The Independent' which

00:24:11.077 --> 00:24:18.077
Shri Mataji is now talking about to Her supposed
attitude towards Hitler and towards the Jewish

00:24:19.016 --> 00:24:23.317
people. So this is just a quotation from the
book

00:24:23.317 --> 00:24:27.866
'Now to all the critics of Hitler he looks
like an idiotic foolish and maniacal type

00:24:27.866 --> 00:24:33.266
of a person. Actually if you listen to any
ego-oriented person or see him, you'll definitely

00:24:33.266 --> 00:24:39.067
witness the idiocy of his talk or his behaviour
very clearly. Of course, if you are not ego-oriented

00:24:39.067 --> 00:24:44.687
yourself. If you are an ego-oriented person
then you will protest against him saying that

00:24:44.687 --> 00:24:49.837
he's trying to assert his ego. An egoist can
always find the ego of another person very

00:24:49.837 --> 00:24:54.327
easily but if you are a person who is afraid
and frightened of egoists you will either

00:24:54.327 --> 00:25:00.547
accept his value system or accept the tyranny
and subjugation of such a tyrant. An evolved

00:25:00.547 --> 00:25:05.146
soul would witness the babbling of an idiot
and may get into an enjoyment of humour at

00:25:05.146 --> 00:25:11.427
this stupid drama. Hitler's ideas impressed
none of these two types, but he captured the

00:25:11.427 --> 00:25:17.567
minds of a third kind, which was innocent,
simple, raw and absolutely immature. The young

00:25:17.567 --> 00:25:23.736
teenagers whom he groomed for years. For these
people killing became a great natural enjoyment.

00:25:23.736 --> 00:25:28.087
In the olden days people used to go to forests
to kill animals, especially tigers, and as

00:25:28.087 --> 00:25:35.087
a result the tiger became a man-eater or attacked
human beings and this killing had to be accepted.

00:25:35.327 --> 00:25:40.707
Even when eating the flesh of animals when
sufficient food was not available was quite

00:25:40.707 --> 00:25:44.077
justified. Most of the people who went to
the forest for hunting did it just for the

00:25:44.077 --> 00:25:50.717
pleasure of killing. This horrible desire
can lead to a very dangerous ending. The horrendous

00:25:50.717 --> 00:25:57.717
war in Germany broke out against the Jews
who had to die in gas chambers because' they

00:25:57.927 --> 00:26:03.047
were very greedy and cruel' and according
to Hitler they had killed Christ. There were

00:26:03.047 --> 00:26:07.787
so many ways in which one could have controlled
these greedy people....

00:26:07.787 --> 00:26:14.787
....And so it goes on. It's a criticism of
Hitler and of Nazism"

00:26:15.646 --> 00:26:22.646
Shri Mataji: I mean how can I support Hitler?
It shows a complete ignorance of Truth. How

00:26:24.746 --> 00:26:31.746
can you write such things in England which
is not a country where all the barbaric people

00:26:39.386 --> 00:26:46.386
live? What has upset me is that I have worked
the most in England. Days together. Day in

00:26:50.657 --> 00:26:57.657
and day out. Now I'm 76 years of age and I've
been working but really people give up. But

00:26:59.766 --> 00:27:06.766
compared to these newspapers, in the smaller
places they're very honest, because they wrote

00:27:07.067 --> 00:27:11.057
about me how I cured people, how I helped
boys and all that. (a reference to a miracle

00:27:11.057 --> 00:27:12.167
in Northampton in 1982 in which a boy is saved
by Shri Mataji after a fall even though She

00:27:12.167 --> 00:27:13.327
was actually in a Public meeting at the time.
That miracle was published in the Local Northampton

00:27:13.327 --> 00:27:14.577
newspaper). But they (The Independent) have
nothing else to write but this, that I take

00:27:14.577 --> 00:27:21.577
money! I do say that I don't take money for
Self-realisation. Because it doesn't understand

00:27:31.307 --> 00:27:38.027
money. Your Kundalini is your Mother, She
doesn't understand money, how can you take

00:27:38.027 --> 00:27:45.027
money for Her? Is a fact.
But if you come to Italy and live there five

00:27:45.417 --> 00:27:52.417
days you want to do it freely everything to
give freely? Is it? Now we have made hospitals,

00:27:54.097 --> 00:28:01.097
I mean, thousand and one things. List hai
na? (Do you have the list?) No? He's not brought

00:28:06.527 --> 00:28:10.236
the list. But I mean so many things we have
made. Orphanage we have made for prostitute

00:28:10.236 --> 00:28:16.567
women, for destitute women. So many things
we are making on the social level. At least

00:28:16.567 --> 00:28:22.116
twenty things in India.
Then in America I bought a land. Hundred and

00:28:22.116 --> 00:28:28.126
forty acres of land. Americans are much more
sensible I must tell you. They don't have

00:28:28.126 --> 00:28:35.126
this kind of a mental attitude that whatever
is written (in a paper) is law, no. They will

00:28:36.927 --> 00:28:43.927
judge it. Otherwise how will you take to Truth?
How will you know the Truth?

00:28:44.736 --> 00:28:51.736
My worry is the country which I think is the
heart of the universe. I regard it as a great

00:28:56.917 --> 00:29:03.917
country, while what's happening to the modern
people? Where are they going? You should have

00:29:08.366 --> 00:29:14.217
been leaders actually, in Sahaja Yoga. I personally
think that way. You are all educated. You

00:29:14.217 --> 00:29:21.217
are known for your education and you are known
for your understanding and here what do you

00:29:25.136 --> 00:29:32.136
find? How are they lured by falsehood.
The problem now is another one, that, by doing

00:29:34.537 --> 00:29:41.537
all this, they will reduce the number of people
who can get Realisation. They will reduce

00:29:44.657 --> 00:29:51.657
the number of people who would know the Truth,
who will create a society of peace and joy

00:29:55.356 --> 00:30:02.356
and love. This is what they are doing. They
don't understand their responsibility and

00:30:03.486 --> 00:30:10.486
they'll drag the whole country into..I don't
know. It's a moral sense you should have to

00:30:15.766 --> 00:30:22.766
understand that what have you been doing so
far and what are we to do? Where our children

00:30:25.697 --> 00:30:32.697
will go? What will happen to them? They are
taking to drugs.In Sahaja Yoga you just give

00:30:32.847 --> 00:30:39.847
up drugs. So many. In England itself there
were seven people who came for [Realisation],

00:30:40.106 --> 00:30:47.106
all drug addicts, all first class [now]. Doing
very well. Doing very good jobs. Drug addiction

00:30:47.187 --> 00:30:54.187
we can reduce in no time. In Italy I might
start a
hospital for drug addicts. Possible in Italy,

00:31:00.817 --> 00:31:07.817
not in England. Not possible. The English
will come there and get there! Can you imagine?

00:31:12.537 --> 00:31:19.537
Why this level has come down? If you have
read Pickwick Papers you know how he has described

00:31:21.657 --> 00:31:28.657
in the democracy that time. Is that the same
democracy is coming now? For me England is

00:31:30.087 --> 00:31:36.256
the same as India, because there are nice
human beings and good human beings, learned

00:31:36.256 --> 00:31:43.256
ones. For me it makes no difference. And it's
important that you all should get your Self-realisation.

00:31:50.886 --> 00:31:57.886
There are so many English here sitting. How
much money have they given me?

00:31:58.337 --> 00:32:05.337
This is a very pivotal point that on such
a small thing like that the whole country

00:32:08.006 --> 00:32:15.006
should be destroyed. Why didn't they come
and ask me? Every time there's one fellow

00:32:21.626 --> 00:32:28.626
comes up. Maybe he's paid by someone. There's
hardly six people, I know all of them. And

00:32:30.427 --> 00:32:35.777
I know why they are doing it because we have
thrown them out of Sahaja Yoga. In no other

00:32:35.777 --> 00:32:42.777
organisation people are thrown out, no other.
Because they are wrong, they are doing wrong

00:32:49.866 --> 00:32:55.557
things, immoral things.
And such people should form such a good group

00:32:55.557 --> 00:33:02.557
for your newspapers here? The newspapers that
used to publish such things about Warren Hastings

00:33:08.256 --> 00:33:12.197
(British Governor-General of Bengal, from
1772 to 1785) and all that, and gave us independence,

00:33:12.197 --> 00:33:19.197
they are the ones. They are the ones who fought
for the right, fought for the truth, not afraid

00:33:23.927 --> 00:33:30.927
of anything. I mean, I think the newspapers
are at such a pivotal position that they can

00:33:35.297 --> 00:33:42.297
kill the nation or can save the nation. I
can't understand still. What is the purpose?

00:33:48.626 --> 00:33:55.626
The purpose is to dissuade people.
Don't you all want to know the truth about

00:34:01.006 --> 00:34:08.006
your Self? You don't want to know? Let it
be. You are free. If you want to know you

00:34:12.346 --> 00:34:19.346
can know. I cannot force. It cannot be forced.
It has to be your will, free will. It has

00:34:24.287 --> 00:34:31.287
to be your will otherwise it won't work out.
If you try to say that "Alright, raise my

00:34:34.157 --> 00:34:41.157
Kundalini!!" I cannot, I cannot.
You must have that pure desire to become the

00:34:45.057 --> 00:34:52.057
Spirit. If you don't have, I cannot, nobody
can raise, it's a fact. Because other desires

00:34:56.837 --> 00:35:03.187
are never satiable as you know. That's the
principle of economics. There's only one desire

00:35:03.187 --> 00:35:09.967
which is satiable is that you have to become
the Spirit, and that you have to become the

00:35:09.967 --> 00:35:16.967
Spirit, is said by all the religions and all
the saints. I'm not the only one who has said.

00:35:21.057 --> 00:35:28.057
Even if you say Tao, or any other such things,
they say the same thing, that, you have to

00:35:28.506 --> 00:35:35.506
become your Self you have to know your Self.
'Know thyself'. Now how do you do it? Is it

00:35:42.976 --> 00:35:49.976
not important to know your Self? If not, alright!
But if it is, then try to get it.

00:35:53.876 --> 00:36:00.876
Now they told me your all very responsible
people have come here. And all of them have

00:36:02.057 --> 00:36:09.057
read the newspaper and all. To me, I can't
believe it. Because you are all educated people.

00:36:15.386 --> 00:36:22.386
You read every day the news and you know the
calamities what are following. What's going

00:36:24.197 --> 00:36:31.197
to happen to this world? Think of it. With
hatred with killings. What is going to happen?

00:36:32.986 --> 00:36:39.986
What is the destiny of human beings? Yesterday
I spoke about that. What is the destiny? Just

00:36:42.876 --> 00:36:49.876
to make some money if you put some controversial
thing (in the paper) it's being very irresponsible.

00:36:51.817 --> 00:36:58.136
This is what they told me that, they want
to know about the newspaper and this and that,

00:36:58.136 --> 00:37:04.616
so I had to tell, but to be very frank, it's
nothing important. We are on the verge of

00:37:04.616 --> 00:37:11.346
jumping over with the last breakthrough of
our evolution and there is this Kundalini.

00:37:11.346 --> 00:37:18.346
No credit should be given to me. It's your
Kundalini, your pure desire and if it is awakened

00:37:24.667 --> 00:37:29.667
and if you get your Realisation then first
you feel cool breeze in your hands. Mohammed

00:37:29.667 --> 00:37:36.667
Sahib has said that, "At the time of resurrection
your hands will speak and they tell you what

00:37:37.266 --> 00:37:39.966
centres you are catching".

00:37:39.966 --> 00:37:46.966
All this knowledge was known to some people
but was never imparted to any, or to very

00:37:48.027 --> 00:37:55.027
few. Only one Guru used to give Realisation
to one person. And whatever you read in Tao

00:37:55.476 --> 00:38:00.886
seems to be something out of the blue, how
can that be? A saint described there is a

00:38:00.886 --> 00:38:07.886
very different type of person. Now, how to
become a sage was not told. Though in the

00:38:13.616 --> 00:38:20.616
Tao system they have said there is a mysterious
female energy within you. Respect the Mother.

00:38:23.626 --> 00:38:30.297
But they didn't say who is this Mother, what
is this, what is her job.

00:38:30.297 --> 00:38:37.297
That way I must say, despite all that, that
Indians are very much near it, because the

00:38:42.746 --> 00:38:49.746
whole culture builds that up. We have also
very bad influences of very bad things, but

00:38:52.207 --> 00:38:59.207
still, those Indians who have come to England
are not very near this, I must say. But those

00:39:02.476 --> 00:39:09.476
who are in India, I don't know why, by changing
the land or whatever it is, very few Indians

00:39:14.547 --> 00:39:21.547
in Sahaja Yoga in England. Why? What is the
reason? They'll go to some babaji who'll give

00:39:24.136 --> 00:39:31.136
them a story, that's all, finished, in the
morning. Why are they not seeking their Self-realisation?

00:39:33.157 --> 00:39:40.157
Only in England! Only in England! What's the
matter? It's difficult to understand. We have

00:39:49.516 --> 00:39:56.516
tried. Sahaja Yogis have tried. They have
given up. Why? What's the matter with Indians

00:40:01.297 --> 00:40:08.297
when they come here? I think they have become
very money-oriented. Whatever it is. I mean,

00:40:11.147 --> 00:40:18.147
in India also there are money oriented people.
I don't know.

00:40:24.827 --> 00:40:31.827
According to Indians, the thing that one has
to achieve is Self-realisation. In life that

00:40:32.057 --> 00:40:39.057
is the most important thing. That's their
tradition that's their education. How they

00:40:47.007 --> 00:40:54.007
are contaminated I don't know. It's surprising.
So what is it that works that way? This is

00:40:57.037 --> 00:41:02.747
your country and you should be proud of this
country. You have given freedom to so many

00:41:02.747 --> 00:41:09.747
countries. You have done so much of good work
and so many blessings are there upon you.

00:41:13.407 --> 00:41:20.407
But be careful now. If you miss the point,
you will miss it.

00:41:27.797 --> 00:41:32.187
Yesterday I told (at the Royal Albert Hall)
what is the destiny of humanity. You see every

00:41:32.187 --> 00:41:38.587
day wars going, fighting going on, killing
going on. There's everywhere racialism or

00:41:38.587 --> 00:41:45.587
anything else. Under the name of religion.
Anything! How human beings have become so

00:41:48.457 --> 00:41:55.457
much perverted God alone knows. But now the
time has come to find your way and help the

00:41:58.337 --> 00:42:05.207
whole world to come around. You can help the
whole world, you can be leaders of the whole

00:42:05.207 --> 00:42:12.207
world, but what I find that nobody takes the
challenge.

00:42:13.857 --> 00:42:20.857
Now the positive side of Sahaja Yoga I need
not tell you. You get cured, you also get

00:42:23.827 --> 00:42:30.827
materially alright, I mean all kinds of things
there are. You become a nice person, sweet

00:42:32.817 --> 00:42:39.817
balanced, happy and you give happiness to
others. We have marriages, we have children

00:42:44.257 --> 00:42:51.257
who are beautiful. Our families are beautiful.
One in a million of course they divorce or

00:42:52.327 --> 00:42:59.327
do anything, is allowed. Nobody is forced.
But we have legal marriages. First they are

00:43:04.687 --> 00:43:11.687
married and then they are registered. Not
illegal, we will not have. As you have here

00:43:13.957 --> 00:43:20.957
we don't have. We don't allow other nonsense
like homosexuality, marriage between men to

00:43:22.937 --> 00:43:29.107
men and all that -- is absurd!!
They all give up, all give up all these habits

00:43:29.107 --> 00:43:36.107
that's the best part of it. Once your Kundalini
rises they all give up all these bad habits.

00:43:37.177 --> 00:43:44.177
All this perverted things which are very shocking
and surprising. And they get cured of many

00:43:45.157 --> 00:43:52.157
diseases. Hospital they said "You have to
pay" I mean how can you have a hospital [free]?

00:43:52.207 --> 00:43:59.207
The building I built but you can't live anywhere
free. And for one bed they charge £4. We

00:44:01.207 --> 00:44:06.597
have five doctors working there now. And for
a room which is air-conditioned, where your

00:44:06.597 --> 00:44:13.597
family can stay, which has an attached bath
and all that they charge only £12. Is it

00:44:15.257 --> 00:44:22.257
too much? Even in India they charge much more.
I mean we can't go on giving free things from

00:44:26.887 --> 00:44:33.887
where are we going to do that? But as they
say "cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap". Cheap it

00:44:36.357 --> 00:44:43.357
is. It's written. Nobody sees the point. The
reason is you are lost in the whirlwind of

00:44:50.617 --> 00:44:57.617
criticism. This is the curse, I don't know
why is this the curse in England. Italy, imagine,

00:44:59.107 --> 00:45:06.107
where Pope lives we have at least ten times
more or twenty times more people there. They

00:45:06.457 --> 00:45:13.457
are curing people, they are giving Realisation,
they are going in the villages, working it

00:45:18.577 --> 00:45:25.577
out. But there must be some curse, I must
say, that you don't see the point. You have

00:45:29.097 --> 00:45:36.097
to be satisfied about yourself. You should
know that you don't know the Truth. This is

00:45:36.347 --> 00:45:43.347
a very subtle Pure Knowledge of a very correct,
to the point.

00:45:43.847 --> 00:45:50.367
Now we have so many doctors, ask them. They
have cured people and they have seen how people

00:45:50.367 --> 00:45:57.367
are cured and they all have this knowledge,
what is the problem is, what a person suffers

00:46:06.827 --> 00:46:13.827
from. I don't know. It's very difficult, I
feel sorry. Every time they ask me Mother

00:46:13.837 --> 00:46:20.837
please come, I come, alright. They are so
anxious I should come, alright, I come, but

00:46:23.017 --> 00:46:30.017
every time? Last time also we had a meeting
like this. How many come out of it? Two or

00:46:36.087 --> 00:46:43.087
three. It's just a function you know, go to
some party or something like that!! You have

00:46:48.097 --> 00:46:55.097
to respect yourself. you have to honour yourself
that you are human beings, highest of evolution,

00:46:58.627 --> 00:47:05.627
and that you have to have your Realisation,
you have to have. Why not? Africans are having,

00:47:06.017 --> 00:47:13.017
why can't you have? It's your due, it's your
birthright I say. To take your Realisation

00:47:18.217 --> 00:47:25.217
is your birthright, but you must respect yourself.
If there's no respect how can I do it?

00:47:27.037 --> 00:47:34.037
I am sorry I had to say this because they
told me that they are all more anxious to

00:47:40.777 --> 00:47:47.777
know about this newspaper. I said 'Alright'.
What good this newspaper has done so far?

00:47:54.637 --> 00:48:01.637
Tell me what has it done? You want to do good
to yourself or no? If you want to do it, you

00:48:10.387 --> 00:48:17.387
are welcome, I am here, if you don't want
to do it, you are free. We are independent

00:48:19.957 --> 00:48:26.957
people and we understand the value of your
independence. Some things they screw up, tell

00:48:28.257 --> 00:48:35.257
you. How can you believe these people? All
this comes because, maybe, they want to make

00:48:44.327 --> 00:48:51.327
money. I can't see why. Now you are all intelligent,
educated people, you think it over, you think

00:48:58.207 --> 00:49:05.207
it over, what wrong am I doing? Alright, you
can ask me questions.

00:49:17.717 --> 00:49:24.717
Question: "Many of your followers meditate
in front of a photograph of you. Some possibly

00:49:46.347 --> 00:49:53.347
regard you as a deity and seem to worship
you. Should they regard you as a deity and

00:50:03.217 --> 00:50:10.217
do you so regard yourself? And I ask the question
as a Christian believer."

00:50:10.397 --> 00:50:16.387
Shri Mataji: "I'm also born Protestant Christian,
and I know Christians where are they."

00:50:16.387 --> 00:50:21.537
Derek Lee: "He's asking about the photograph
Shri Mataji, that, sahaja yogis meditate in

00:50:21.537 --> 00:50:27.977
front of the photograph and asks whether we
consider you to be a divine personality and

00:50:27.977 --> 00:50:32.527
whether you are a divine personality. He's
very direct person Shri Mataji."

00:50:32.527 --> 00:50:39.527
Shri Mataji: "It's like confession (laughter).
It is very difficult to be born in those days

00:50:56.197 --> 00:51:03.197
and talk about spirituality, very difficult,
but has to be done in these horrible days

00:51:07.317 --> 00:51:14.317
only. And only I think I was capable, Christ
would have been crucified much earlier but

00:51:16.977 --> 00:51:23.977
I have sustained myself. Photograph, who has
said you should not have, Christ never said

00:51:24.517 --> 00:51:31.517
that. Did he? It helps, photograph does help,
what can I do? It helps a lot, it has helped

00:51:46.667 --> 00:51:53.667
so many. All of them will tell you their experiences
about the photograph. I didn't allow them,

00:51:55.967 --> 00:52:02.967
but they found it themselves and they told
me 'Mother, your photograph is very helpful'.

00:52:03.027 --> 00:52:10.027
There are so many miracles that every time
I get so many letters. So I asked one gentleman,

00:52:13.897 --> 00:52:20.897
he's a scientist, that you compile them. So
after a month he says 'Mother, now the letters

00:52:22.047 --> 00:52:29.047
have come over my head and here also, this
side and I think you better see yourself and

00:52:29.227 --> 00:52:36.227
tell me which one to write!' You see for yourself
how it works. It is, you see, it is something,

00:52:43.787 --> 00:52:50.787
no doubt. There are prophecies about it, all
over. But to understand it first you get your

00:53:00.167 --> 00:53:07.167
Realisation. Without that you cannot. What
is another objection? Have you shown them

00:53:12.997 --> 00:53:16.177
miraculous photographs? "
Derek Lee: "We showed them in the Albert Hall

00:53:16.177 --> 00:53:19.247
yesterday, not tonight."
Shri Mataji: "Now what are these miraculous

00:53:19.247 --> 00:53:26.247
ones. We have not made them, nothing. How
do you see those lights, how do you explain,

00:53:28.887 --> 00:53:35.887
all around me? I've told them now that Quanta
Theory is that. Let some physicist come round.

00:53:40.857 --> 00:53:47.857
There are two physicists from Russia and one
from Brazil, they are writing about it. It's

00:54:13.107 --> 00:54:20.107
the Quantum Theory, that will explain. When
I said something, anything about it, there

00:54:39.087 --> 00:54:46.087
are doctors they can research it and find
out. Is the Quantum Theory. Unless and until

00:54:57.287 --> 00:55:04.287
you have an open mind you cannot see things.
(Derek Lee talks about miracle photos on boat

00:55:22.937 --> 00:55:29.937
in Italy in Sorrento.)
First of all one has to know that problems

00:55:34.107 --> 00:55:41.107
are created by religion. Why? Why should any
religion create a problem? Because of our

00:55:45.317 --> 00:55:52.317
reactions to the Truth! And Christianity,
because I was born as a Christian, I found

00:55:53.827 --> 00:56:00.827
out the reason, what is the reason, why it
has happened. If you come to sahaja yoga you

00:56:02.547 --> 00:56:04.367
will know.

00:56:04.367 --> 00:56:11.367
Another thing, it's a myth that Christ made
alcohol in that wedding. It's a myth. The

00:56:16.467 --> 00:56:23.467
myth is that He went there and He made water
into alcohol. No! It was grape juice. Now

00:56:28.957 --> 00:56:35.957
think about it, can you make any wine spontaneously?
It has to rot and rot and rot and the more

00:56:41.497 --> 00:56:48.497
it rots is better. Is a fact. I asked somebody
about English, why is it? They said "Mother,

00:56:50.877 --> 00:56:57.877
they drink a lot". The best house in a village
is always a pub! You go to any place, [if]

00:57:10.247 --> 00:57:17.247
you want to find out about somebody, ask in
the pub! Better than police station they will

00:57:18.487 --> 00:57:25.487
tell you "This man lives there, this man lives
there" -- very politely!

00:57:26.867 --> 00:57:33.867
Drinking is so much here, baapare baap, in
my book I've written down a little bit. Actually,

00:57:37.107 --> 00:57:44.107
one of my husband's friends, very good man,
he died. So he said "You should come" [to

00:57:44.937 --> 00:57:50.587
the funeral], I said "I would love to come".
But he said "Must have a full black dress".

00:57:50.587 --> 00:57:57.087
"But I don't have full black dress". You have
to have a formal dress for the dead body,

00:57:57.087 --> 00:58:04.087
can you imagine! I was so upset and I said
"I am not coming." Then he went there and

00:58:04.907 --> 00:58:09.077
he described the whole thing. When he came
back he was so sick. He said "First they had

00:58:09.077 --> 00:58:16.077
a lunch before going to the cemetery", can
you imagine? And then they said "Now to go

00:58:18.347 --> 00:58:25.347
for dinner back". Everybody anxious to go
to the dinner. Nobody cried or wept or anything.

00:58:25.557 --> 00:58:32.557
Only thing you had to wear a black dress!
It shows no emotional attachment! If somebody

00:58:37.017 --> 00:58:44.017
dies, it's so heartfelt. Nobody! I
was so shocked and he was very upset because
a friend had died. They said, "What's the

00:58:48.367 --> 00:58:55.367
matter are you not well?" They couldn't understand!
There's no relationship of love. As soon as

00:59:01.157 --> 00:59:08.157
they die they will jump to find out who has
got what in the property.

00:59:09.687 --> 00:59:16.687
Our neighbour was there, he died [and] for
one month, nobody knew he was dead there.

00:59:17.617 --> 00:59:24.617
He was alone, poor thing. He was alone and
he was an old man and nobody knew. Then, I

00:59:29.597 --> 00:59:35.327
don't know, something, but they said this
had smell or something like that, and the

00:59:35.327 --> 00:59:42.327
man who was taking milk to him saw the milk
bottles one after another but he never enquired.

00:59:43.397 --> 00:59:50.397
He said, "I thought he's gone on a holiday"
The house was open. This is our feelings are

00:59:54.177 --> 01:00:00.847
not good.
This is a country which I call is the heart

01:00:00.847 --> 01:00:07.847
of the universe. And also your newspapers
circulate all over. In one of my miraculous

01:00:14.297 --> 01:00:21.127
photographs they were singing [the song] "Sitting
in the heart of the universe" and heart, heart

01:00:21.127 --> 01:00:28.127
like that [appeared]. Just like the doctors
draw. Many hearts came in. Just imagine! The

01:00:35.327 --> 01:00:42.327
proof. But they are heartless people. No feelings
for your own father, for your own mother,

01:00:47.537 --> 01:00:51.097
for your own people. I can understand Americans
who are only 200 year old, this thing, but

01:00:51.097 --> 01:00:58.097
you are one of the oldest people. Yes doctor?
Brian Wells: "Shri Mataji at the Albert Hall

01:01:16.927 --> 01:01:23.927
last night many people experienced a powerful
experience they felt vibrations on their hand

01:01:34.317 --> 01:01:39.917
they felt cool air coming from their heads.
Could you say something about why they seem

01:01:39.917 --> 01:01:46.917
to ignore this, why do they not understand
that there is something very powerful going

01:01:48.427 --> 01:01:55.427
on here"
Shri Mataji: "I can ask you the same question!

01:01:55.717 --> 01:02:02.717
I don't know. They talk of baptism and for
that they'll spend so much money, everything,

01:02:07.517 --> 01:02:14.517
but they don't realise their own baptism.
I don't know where are they lost. And every

01:02:16.837 --> 01:02:23.837
one of them raised [their] hand (to say that
they had felt it), every one of them! You

01:02:26.007 --> 01:02:33.007
are a different calibre doctor. I don't know
what to say. I don't know. What should we

01:02:42.517 --> 01:02:49.517
do to awaken people to reality? What should
we do? Now as this gentleman says he's a Christian.

01:02:57.657 --> 01:03:04.657
There are so many Christians, what do they
do? Go to church? The mayor in Cabella where

01:03:08.197 --> 01:03:13.667
I live, he asked me 'Mother what do you do
to these people?' I said 'I do nothing.' He

01:03:13.667 --> 01:03:19.537
said 'They are sitting with you for nine hours,
what are you telling them? What are you talking?

01:03:19.537 --> 01:03:25.847
What's happening? While' he said 'I go to
church after 15 minutes I start seeing the

01:03:25.847 --> 01:03:32.847
watch and after 30 minutes I run away'. You
must get your Self-realisation. Christ has

01:03:38.517 --> 01:03:45.517
said 'Know thy Self'. That's the criteria.
Alright? Once you know your Self you'll know

01:03:50.597 --> 01:03:57.597
everything. If you don't know your Self where
are you?

01:04:01.507 --> 01:04:08.507
I am here to prove about Christ and about
all the great incarnations. How they were

01:04:12.307 --> 01:04:19.307
one. And to give you that Spirit which enlightens
your mind. That's what you deserve. That's

01:04:29.467 --> 01:04:36.357
what you should have. Not only reading Bible
but reading your Self."

01:04:36.357 --> 01:04:43.357
(Somebody in the audience says he's coming
for the first time but his wife has done Sahaja

01:05:18.807 --> 01:05:25.807
Yoga for 2 years and he sees that it has done
her nothing but good)

01:05:28.907 --> 01:05:35.907
Shri Mataji: " That's the point. You have
to have transformation. There are many who

01:05:36.127 --> 01:05:40.717
will say this. And you now come to Cabella
and see for yourself. " (applause)

01:05:40.717 --> 01:05:44.117
Yogini's husband: "Is that a personal invitation?"
(laughing)

01:05:44.117 --> 01:05:51.117
Shri Mataji: "Actually, you see, it's rather
spartan to be in Cabella because I bought

01:05:57.047 --> 01:06:02.757
lots of lands there, but one thing bad about
this authority in Cabella there, they don't

01:06:02.757 --> 01:06:09.357
give you a permission to build. So it's going
on and on and on still that permit for me

01:06:09.357 --> 01:06:14.607
to build something for Sahaja Yogis. Though
I have bought one house, but this is little

01:06:14.607 --> 01:06:21.607
spartan but people enjoy. In a camp they enjoy
very much. India is not that difficult. Italy

01:06:24.277 --> 01:06:31.277
it is. And the government goes on changing
you see. So one government gives you permission

01:06:33.507 --> 01:06:40.507
another says 'no'. But you will enjoy, come
along!"

01:06:41.777 --> 01:06:48.777
Question: "I was reading somewhere that we
are not human beings having a spiritual experience

01:07:05.587 --> 01:07:11.387
but we are spiritual beings having a human
experience have you any comments on that?"

01:07:11.387 --> 01:07:17.967
Shri Mataji: "Of course. Of course you are.
You are not this body, you are not this mind,

01:07:17.967 --> 01:07:24.967
you are the Spirit. That's what you have to
be! And once you become the Spirit you will

01:07:27.027 --> 01:07:34.027
know your powers. You become just loving angels.
Very good idea!"

01:07:56.577 --> 01:08:03.577
Question: "I follow the Christian faith and
I'd like to ask you what difference you see

01:08:27.507 --> 01:08:34.507
if any difference at all between your experience
and the laying on of hands by the elders as

01:08:36.577 --> 01:08:43.127
said in the gospel of St.James, chapter 5.
Perhaps you could give us your views on that

01:08:43.127 --> 01:08:46.217
please."
Shri Mataji: "I haven't seen anything like

01:08:46.217 --> 01:08:52.737
that happening. In Sahaja yoga so many things
happen I must say. I mean I am myself surprised

01:08:52.737 --> 01:08:59.737
when they tell me how people are cured. The
other day only, in Italy, there was one fellow

01:09:01.787 --> 01:09:07.317
who used to play ...what instrument is that?"
Sahaja Yogi: "Double bass"

01:09:07.317 --> 01:09:11.777
Shri Mataji: "Ha! And he, when he came on
the stage, you see, they told me 'Mother you

01:09:11.777 --> 01:09:18.777
have saved his life'. I said 'How?' So, his
heart was open for an operation and the doctors

01:09:20.927 --> 01:09:27.927
gave up saying that his aortic vein is missing
and they closed the heart and they said he

01:09:31.237 --> 01:09:38.237
will die. And he just saw my hand he says,
when he slept he saw my hand. When he was

01:09:40.667 --> 01:09:47.667
in a slumber I think. And then he opened his
eyes, still he saw my hand. And he got cured,

01:09:51.977 --> 01:09:58.137
completely cured. So many things have happened.
Actually I also don't know my own powers,

01:09:58.137 --> 01:10:05.137
it has become like that. So many things like
that. This

01:11:45.867 --> 01:11:52.867
is one I'm telling because it's recently.
It happens.

01:12:27.727 --> 01:12:34.727
...Finished? Should we have Realisation now?
There's one fellow standing there he's writing

01:13:13.457 --> 01:13:20.457
who is he?"
Journalist: "I spoke to your organiser, I'm

01:13:27.457 --> 01:13:34.457
from the Daily Mirror"
Shri Mataji: "Ah, nice you have come, I'm

01:13:42.957 --> 01:13:49.957
very happy. I hope you all understand your
responsibility as newspaper people. Very important.

01:13:59.647 --> 01:14:06.647
They don't realise what powers they have.
They don't realise. Now they are better but,

01:14:12.676 --> 01:14:19.676
first time in India, we had some people from
the newspaper and they openly told me, 'Do

01:14:22.866 --> 01:14:29.866
you want one column? So you'll have to call
us to one restaurant there and give us a nice

01:14:32.007 --> 01:14:39.007
treat. If you want two columns, then you have
to give a complete dinner.' (laughter) I was

01:14:44.106 --> 01:14:49.967
looking at them, I said 'Sorry, I don't want
to have even a word from you but thank you'.

01:14:49.967 --> 01:14:56.967
But now they have improved. They have improved
because some very important people in India

01:15:02.516 --> 01:15:09.516
are supportive of Sahaja Yoga. Very important.
So it has improved. They don't do all this.

01:15:13.766 --> 01:15:20.766
I think, now better have our Realisation,
is the best. That's your own. That you should

01:15:21.926 --> 01:15:28.926
have. Just put your hands to me"
