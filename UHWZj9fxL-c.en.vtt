00:00:23.941 --> 00:00:30.364
This is the world that feeds the Swiss
Banks’ Octopus.

00:00:30.623 --> 00:00:36.896
This is the world where too much
is not enough.

00:00:37.097 --> 00:00:42.093
This is the world where negativity
is a plus.

00:00:42.294 --> 00:00:50.017
This is the world where the saints
say: “Enough”.

00:01:06.176 --> 00:01:11.038
1. This is a world where 1.3 billion
people

00:01:11.239 --> 00:01:15.257
live on an income of less
than $1 a day

00:01:15.458 --> 00:01:20.303
and where the planet does not have
enough natural resources

00:01:20.504 --> 00:01:25.296
to sustain, at a worldwide scale,
the consumption pattern

00:01:25.497 --> 00:01:29.233
of Malaysia, leave alone America.

00:01:29.434 --> 00:01:31.247
PLEASE SHRI DURGA,

00:01:31.448 --> 00:01:36.072
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

00:01:36.273 --> 00:01:40.906
Om Twameva Sakshat

00:01:41.107 --> 00:01:48.655
Shri Durga Namoh Namaha.

00:01:48.856 --> 00:01:52.375
2. This is a world where ten per cent
of world trade

00:01:52.576 --> 00:01:57.757
is generated by drugs and narco-traffics,
or US$100 billion

00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:01.914
represents the amount that yearly
poisons mankind,

00:02:02.115 --> 00:02:05.078
while money laundering in Switzerland
and elsewhere

00:02:05.286 --> 00:02:07.710
has become a most prosperous
activity,

00:02:07.911 --> 00:02:11.538
reaching all levels of society.

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.898
PLEASE SHRI RAKTABIJA VINASHINI,

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:19.283
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

00:02:19.484 --> 00:02:24.403
Om Twameva Sakshat

00:02:24.604 --> 00:02:34.195
Shri Raktabija Vinashini
Namoh Namaha.

00:02:34.396 --> 00:02:38.263
3. This is a world where Wall Street
sucks the wealth

00:02:38.464 --> 00:02:41.880
from the working middle class
to bestow it upon the rich

00:02:42.081 --> 00:02:46.318
and where Walt Disney makes you
forget all about it.

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.099
PLEASE SHRI KATYAYANI,

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.487
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

00:02:53.688 --> 00:02:58.425
Om Twameva Sakshat

00:02:58.626 --> 00:03:08.214
Shri Katyayani Namoh Namaha.

00:03:08.415 --> 00:03:14.152
4. This is a world where an Egyptian
eats at MacDonalds in Cairo

00:03:14.353 --> 00:03:19.804
and a Chinese at Pizza Hut in Beijing,
because modern consumerism

00:03:20.005 --> 00:03:24.719
expresses the lowest common
denominator of world culture

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.492
and erases the meaning of national
values and traditions.

00:03:30.693 --> 00:03:33.522
PLEASE SHRI SHAKAMBARI,

00:03:33.723 --> 00:03:37.835
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

00:03:38.036 --> 00:03:42.491
Om Twameva Sakshat

00:03:42.692 --> 00:03:50.321
Shri Shakambari Namoh Namaha.

00:03:50.522 --> 00:03:54.731
5. The new multinational entities are
experimenting with new forms

00:03:54.932 --> 00:03:59.780
of dictatorship, setting their production
sites in the developing world,

00:03:59.981 --> 00:04:03.218
reducing to slavery a subdued
working class

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:07.772
and exploiting children on the altar
of productivity gains.

00:04:07.973 --> 00:04:10.100
PLEASE SHRI RAKSHAKARI,

00:04:10.301 --> 00:04:14.358
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:18.913
Om Twameva Sakshat

00:04:19.114 --> 00:04:26.968
Shri Rakshakari Namoh Namaha.

00:04:27.239 --> 00:04:32.335
6. The globalization of production and
services allow a few global players

00:04:32.566 --> 00:04:36.389
to befool us and impose the rules
of their game

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.827
to the mass of unsuspecting
consumers.

00:04:40.028 --> 00:04:41.991
PLEASE SHRI BHIMADEVI,

00:04:42.192 --> 00:04:46.077
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

00:04:46.278 --> 00:04:50.586
Om Twameva Sakshat

00:04:50.787 --> 00:05:00.102
Shri Bhimadevi Namoh Namaha.

00:05:00.303 --> 00:05:04.758
7. Vast restructuration endeavours
are progressively leading

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:09.112
to the eradication of small and
medium-sized enterprises

00:05:09.313 --> 00:05:15.722
for the benefit of gigantic corporations
operating on a worldwide scale.

00:05:15.923 --> 00:05:17.486
PLEASE SHRI CHANDIKA,

00:05:17.687 --> 00:05:22.489
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.376
Om Twameva Sakshat

00:05:27.577 --> 00:05:35.531
Shri Chandika Namoh Namaha.

00:05:35.732 --> 00:05:40.972
8. The gradual concentration of liquid
wealth in the hands of the super rich

00:05:41.173 --> 00:05:45.915
is marginalizing national sovereignty
and its elected officials,

00:05:46.116 --> 00:05:50.761
and is imposing a titanic dimension
to the ruler-ship of money.

00:05:50.962 --> 00:05:52.749
PLEASE SHRI RAKSHASAGNI,

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.574
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

00:05:56.775 --> 00:06:01.668
Om Twameva Sakshat

00:06:01.869 --> 00:06:10.026
Shri Rakshasagni Namoh Namaha.

00:06:10.227 --> 00:06:13.386
9. Greed raised to the power 108

00:06:13.587 --> 00:06:17.001
means the pauperization of the world’s
middle class

00:06:17.217 --> 00:06:21.239
and outrageous wealth for
the remaining 10%.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.077
PLEASE SHRI DAITYENDRA MARDINI,

00:06:24.278 --> 00:06:28.667
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

00:06:28.868 --> 00:06:33.291
Om Twameva Sakshat

00:06:33.492 --> 00:06:44.421
Shri Daityendra Mardini Namoh Namaha.

00:06:44.622 --> 00:06:49.491
10. The systematic elimination
of alternative economic solutions,

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:55.652
unequal trade and financial manipulations
are challenging

00:06:55.854 --> 00:07:00.241
the equitable distribution of wealth
among the population of the world.

00:07:00.442 --> 00:07:02.228
PLEASE SHRI VAJRINI,

00:07:02.429 --> 00:07:05.718
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:10.951
Om Twameva Sakshat

00:07:11.152 --> 00:07:18.260
Shri Vajrini Namoh Namaha.

00:07:18.461 --> 00:07:22.986
11. The deregulation of the financial
markets has opened wide the gates

00:07:23.187 --> 00:07:28.647
of Jurassic Park for the large financial
predators to roam about

00:07:28.848 --> 00:07:33.848
and thousands of billions of dollars are
created from nothing by speculators

00:07:34.049 --> 00:07:37.403
to feed their unlimited thirst for money
and power.

00:07:37.604 --> 00:07:39.898
PLEASE SHRI UGRACHANDESHWARI,

00:07:40.099 --> 00:07:44.593
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

00:07:44.794 --> 00:07:49.003
Om Twameva Sakshat

00:07:49.204 --> 00:07:58.528
Shri Ugrachandeshwari Namoh Namaha.

00:07:58.729 --> 00:08:03.486
12. The Swiss financial centre works
as a haven for rich tax-dodgers

00:08:03.687 --> 00:08:07.546
from developing countries, and diverts
needed capital

00:08:07.747 --> 00:08:11.772
from national investment programmes,
industrial infrastructures

00:08:11.973 --> 00:08:18.397
and social expenditure to inflate the stock
exchange of the developed countries.

00:08:18.598 --> 00:08:20.980
PLEASE SHRI UGRAPRABHA,

00:08:21.181 --> 00:08:25.222
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

00:08:25.423 --> 00:08:29.988
Om Twameva Sakshat

00:08:30.189 --> 00:08:39.434
Shri Ugraprabha Namoh Namaha.

00:08:39.635 --> 00:08:44.654
13. The trend of today’s mega mergers
is to marginalize the State,

00:08:44.855 --> 00:08:49.358
bypass national legislation, manipulate
the market,

00:08:49.559 --> 00:08:53.950
control the economy and, for all
practical purposes,

00:08:54.151 --> 00:08:59.369
finish off the social foundations
of real democracy.

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:01.396
PLEASE SHRI MAHAKALI,

00:09:01.597 --> 00:09:06.282
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

00:09:06.483 --> 00:09:11.328
Om Twameva Sakshat

00:09:11.529 --> 00:09:20.657
Shri Mahakali Namoh Namaha.

00:09:20.858 --> 00:09:24.527
14. The lure and mirage of such a radical
concentration of wealth

00:09:24.728 --> 00:09:29.230
and power threatens to neutralize
all seeking of the Spirit,

00:09:29.431 --> 00:09:33.267
and the deafening roar of the triumph
of asuric materialism

00:09:33.468 --> 00:09:36.540
destroys the hope of millions
of seekers.

00:09:36.741 --> 00:09:38.486
PLEASE SHRI MAHAMAYA,

00:09:38.687 --> 00:09:42.983
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

00:09:43.184 --> 00:09:47.925
Om Twameva Sakshat

00:09:48.126 --> 00:09:56.617
Shri Mahamaya Namoh Namaha.

00:09:56.818 --> 00:10:01.326
15. The alliance of mafia, secretive
bankers and corrupt managers

00:10:01.527 --> 00:10:06.697
has infiltrated the world economy and
is threatening the ethics of collectivity

00:10:06.898 --> 00:10:13.313
which provides the foundation for the value
system of our entire civilization.

00:10:13.514 --> 00:10:15.580
PLEASE SHRI VIRATANGANA,

00:10:15.781 --> 00:10:20.498
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

00:10:20.699 --> 00:10:25.171
Om Twameva Sakshat

00:10:25.372 --> 00:10:35.284
Shri Viratangana Namoh Namaha.

00:10:35.485 --> 00:10:40.818
16. The enormous increase of financial
assets has siphoned cash money

00:10:41.019 --> 00:10:45.776
out of the real economy and channeled it
into the financial markets,

00:10:45.977 --> 00:10:49.174
building up a planetary gambling
casino

00:10:49.375 --> 00:10:53.473
where arbitrary currency speculation
can mount

00:10:53.674 --> 00:11:00.847
huge attacks against any country which
tries to follow socially-minded policies.

00:11:01.048 --> 00:11:03.556
PLEASE SHRI KHADGAPALINI,

00:11:03.757 --> 00:11:08.007
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

00:11:08.208 --> 00:11:12.429
Om Twameva Sakshat

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:20.777
Shri Khadgapalini Namoh Namaha.

00:11:20.978 --> 00:11:26.850
17. The etheric sophistication of financial
electronic circuits has created

00:11:27.051 --> 00:11:33.285
a virtual world where the immateriality
of money has become the sole reality.

00:11:33.486 --> 00:11:35.093
PLEASE SHRI VISHNUMAYA,

00:11:35.294 --> 00:11:39.860
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

00:11:40.061 --> 00:11:44.301
Om Twameva Sakshat

00:11:44.502 --> 00:11:52.697
Shri Vishnumaya Namoh Namaha.

00:11:52.898 --> 00:11:55.881
18. The progressive domination
of technology

00:11:56.082 --> 00:11:59.903
is sucking the blood of the farmer,
the artist and the potter,

00:12:00.111 --> 00:12:05.842
turning the man who works with his hands
into a permanently handicapped person.

00:12:06.043 --> 00:12:08.870
PLEASE SHRI DEVA KARYA SAMUDYATA,

00:12:09.071 --> 00:12:13.207
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

00:12:13.408 --> 00:12:17.847
Om Twameva Sakshat

00:12:18.048 --> 00:12:27.857
Shri Deva Karya Samudyata Namoh Namaha.

00:12:28.058 --> 00:12:33.155
19. The information highway leads
to the maya web of a virtual world

00:12:33.356 --> 00:12:38.096
where human attention is scattered,
desire is confused,

00:12:38.297 --> 00:12:43.768
truth is atomized and the soul
is thereby reduced to slavery.

00:12:43.969 --> 00:12:45.715
PLEASE SHRI RADHA,

00:12:45.916 --> 00:12:50.482
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

00:12:50.683 --> 00:12:54.918
Om Twameva Sakshat

00:12:55.119 --> 00:13:03.039
Shri Radha Namoh Namaha.

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:07.019
20. Modern communication can become
a domestic [may that mean “demonic”] tool

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:11.738
in the hands of a few media moguls
and opinion-making tycoons

00:13:11.939 --> 00:13:19.062
which are spreading their hedonistic
world views of power, money and sex.

00:13:19.263 --> 00:13:21.383
PLEASE SHRI SHUKRATMIKA,

00:13:21.567 --> 00:13:26.037
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

00:13:26.238 --> 00:13:30.677
Om Twameva Sakshat

00:13:30.878 --> 00:13:38.933
Shri Shukratmika Namoh Namaha.

00:13:39.134 --> 00:13:44.008
21. The Mlechas of Satan have infiltrated
the Internet global village

00:13:44.209 --> 00:13:47.978
to pour pornographic dirt and filth
within the nest

00:13:48.179 --> 00:13:53.981
of the family and to spread hell’s shadows
in the minds of helpless people.

00:13:54.182 --> 00:13:56.212
PLEASE SHRI NIRMALA KUMARI,

00:13:56.413 --> 00:14:00.828
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

00:14:01.036 --> 00:14:05.969
Om Twameva Sakshat

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:16.656
Shri Nirmala Kumari Namoh Namaha.

00:14:16.857 --> 00:14:21.869
Hail, salutations to the great Devi!
Aum, Amen.

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:26.121
May there be Auspiciousness,
Joy and Peace.

00:14:26.322 --> 00:14:29.362
May Thy Divine grace penetrate
the waters

00:14:29.563 --> 00:14:33.376
flowing from our mountains to the four
corners of Europe

00:14:33.577 --> 00:14:38.753
and spread the pure vibrations
of the Aquarian Age.

00:14:38.954 --> 00:14:42.670
Salutations to Thee Shri Mataji
Nirmala Devi Ji,

00:14:42.871 --> 00:14:46.694
the Resplendent One, O formidable
Avatar!

00:14:46.895 --> 00:14:51.293
We bow to Thee, most pleasing
yet most frightful,

00:14:51.494 --> 00:14:57.451
who has been approached by the Trimurtis
for the sake of protecting the universe.

00:14:57.652 --> 00:15:00.831
Today, in this festival of Navaratri,

00:15:01.032 --> 00:15:04.517
we chant the litany of Thy children
in Switzerland

00:15:04.718 --> 00:15:07.101
for the defeat of the foes
of the Spirit,

00:15:07.302 --> 00:15:15.167
and we offer to Thy glittering teeth
the new asuric forms of materialism.

00:15:15.368 --> 00:15:17.650
PLEASE SHRI RAKTADANTIKA,

00:15:17.851 --> 00:15:24.290
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

00:15:24.491 --> 00:15:32.378
Om Twameva Sakshat

00:15:32.579 --> 00:15:39.235
Shri Kalki Sakshat

00:15:39.436 --> 00:15:47.435
Shri Sahastrara Swamini

00:15:47.636 --> 00:16:00.277
Moksha Pradayini Mataji

00:16:00.486 --> 00:16:14.777
Shri Nirmala Devyai Namoh Namaha.
