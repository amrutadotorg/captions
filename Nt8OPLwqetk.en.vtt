00:00:01.921 --> 00:00:06.918
I’m sorry I’ve not been able to speak
to you in English language

00:00:06.951 --> 00:00:12.598
- and I’ve spoken some time. This special
day today is the day of Sankrant.

00:00:12.623 --> 00:00:18.813
Sankr – you know ‘San’ means good,
holy, and ‘krant’ means the –

00:00:18.838 --> 00:00:23.237
(A yogi says in a low voice: “Revolution”.
Shri Mataji says some words in marathi)

00:00:23.262 --> 00:00:26.249
When I speak Marathi I forget English –
Yogis: Revolution.

00:00:26.274 --> 00:00:30.982
Shri Mataji: Revolution.
Holy revolution. Holy.

00:00:31.007 --> 00:00:34.361
And that’s what I’m telling them,

00:00:35.337 --> 00:00:39.660
what is the Holy Revolution is, that your
own Dharma is established

00:00:39.685 --> 00:00:42.399
now through Sahaja Yoga. You know
what is your Dharma.

00:00:42.424 --> 00:00:45.025
Because if you don’t do your own
Dharmas

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.699
you’ll be lost. Your vibrations will
be lost.

00:00:47.724 --> 00:00:52.463
You’ll immediately know that in your
seeking you have lost something.

00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:59.311
You’ll be affected and so you have
to correct. That’s not so difficult.

00:00:59.336 --> 00:01:06.563
But to make it a Sankranta – the Holy
Revolution – you have to take to new

00:01:07.262 --> 00:01:13.429
– new religion, new steps. First of all,
your own step should be enlightened,

00:01:13.454 --> 00:01:18.394
and then you have to establish new steps
to go ahead.

00:01:18.419 --> 00:01:21.816
And these are the new steps which
are different

00:01:21.841 --> 00:01:25.457
for the Westerners and different
for the Easterners.

00:01:25.482 --> 00:01:31.165
Just now I told them about the Eastern
style and then I’ll tell you later on

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:37.383
about the Western. We have to have
new ideals,

00:01:37.408 --> 00:01:45.689
new styles because we are the courageous
people, we are the valiant people.

00:01:45.714 --> 00:01:52.751
We have to fight the war of love,
through love.

00:01:54.154 --> 00:02:01.345
And it’s a very delicate thing. When
the moon moves – the sun moves –

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:08.992
from the left to the right that means
your desire becomes your action.

00:02:09.017 --> 00:02:13.517
Today is the day they give you a sweet
thing to say that

00:02:13.542 --> 00:02:21.241
you must speak sweetly which is very
important for Western people;

00:02:22.257 --> 00:02:28.153
that when you are doing and organizing
you become heated up,

00:02:28.178 --> 00:02:34.507
there’s tension and you develop the
temperament which is dry, emotionless.

00:02:34.532 --> 00:02:38.504
You know the heart goes into a tantrum.

00:02:38.529 --> 00:02:43.773
At that time they say that you take
the sweet.This sweet is a heating thing

00:02:43.798 --> 00:02:51.678
because now the sun is moving towards
the other side.

00:02:51.703 --> 00:02:56.107
That time also they, to give it a balance,
they say: “Speak very sweetly.

00:02:56.132 --> 00:03:00.183
Use sweet words, use sweetness.

00:03:00.208 --> 00:03:04.721
Bring sweetness in your language.”
- Which is very important,

00:03:04.746 --> 00:03:09.541
you understand that. And this is one
of the religions we have to accept

00:03:09.566 --> 00:03:17.059
that we will not use harsh words to each
other and then later on to others.

00:03:17.084 --> 00:03:20.413
First of all to each other. There are many
people who will be kind to others

00:03:20.438 --> 00:03:24.608
because others will eat them off but
unkind to their own sahaja yogis.

00:03:24.633 --> 00:03:31.474
Because it is a universal happening. It’s
the whole thing is working out universally.

00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:36.054
Even if you organize, you organize
for the whole.

00:03:37.282 --> 00:03:42.960
Those who are organizing have no business
to be harsh

00:03:42.985 --> 00:03:48.332
and those who are not organizing has
no business to be slow.

00:03:48.357 --> 00:03:53.018
We must move with the same speed,
with the same understanding.

00:03:53.043 --> 00:04:00.012
There’s a story in Marathi language
which is a very good story that a –

00:04:01.345 --> 00:04:08.970
[Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi]
- the bird-catcher had put lots of

00:04:08.995 --> 00:04:15.955
temptations of good grain for some birds
– pigeons

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:23.166
and the pigeons didn’t see the nest [net]
– the trap -

00:04:23.191 --> 00:04:30.353
and they all came down to eat that.
And there was a net there.

00:04:31.306 --> 00:04:36.138
In the net their feet were entangled.

00:04:36.791 --> 00:04:43.885
So the solution was found out that:
‘If all of us with the same speed

00:04:44.695 --> 00:04:53.560
take off, we’ll take away the whole
of the net and then he cannot catch us.’

00:04:54.318 --> 00:04:56.891
So, one person said: ‘Alright, as soon
as I say ‘yes’,

00:04:56.916 --> 00:04:59.634
let us all start with the same speed.

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:04.338
If somebody increases his speed
he is brought down.

00:05:05.184 --> 00:05:09.098
In the same way Sahaja Yoga has to be
worked out;

00:05:09.123 --> 00:05:14.224
and that’s why to keep up the speed
keep yourself

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:19.438
peaceful, loving, affectionate.

00:05:19.463 --> 00:05:22.992
Peace is the way we are going
to achieve it.

00:05:23.017 --> 00:05:27.395
This is an explosive peace.

00:05:27.932 --> 00:05:32.845
By giving contrasts you bring the balance
in: explosive.

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:37.112
You have read also about the Goddess
– the different aspects of Goddess.

00:05:37.137 --> 00:05:40.878
Always: ‘Ati saumya, Ati Raudra’ [gentle
like the Moon and terrible like Rudra]

00:05:40.903 --> 00:05:46.471
To give the two contrasts by which bring
the balance in the middle.

00:05:46.496 --> 00:05:54.865
That’s how you must understand that
Sahaja Yoga is a very unique revolution.

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:59.768
I told them also politically and also
socially – in every way

00:05:59.793 --> 00:06:04.715
how we are going to improve every
country.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:09.764
Thus the whole world – the whole universe.

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:14.156
Later on I’ll translate the whole thing
for you.

00:06:14.181 --> 00:06:18.821
So today’s special day, very great day,

00:06:18.846 --> 00:06:25.627
let us ask that – when you are doing
this Puja,

00:06:25.652 --> 00:06:33.660
ask for new religions within you to be
enshrined,

00:06:33.685 --> 00:06:40.505
to be sustained within ourselves and try
to imbibe them.

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:43.792
They will be permeating but you have
to accept them;

00:06:43.817 --> 00:06:47.837
and [you] should know it’s a big fight;

00:06:48.354 --> 00:06:53.475
and it’s a very different type of a fight
of peace and love.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:59.460
That’s why they say: ‘Speak sweetly.
Be sweet with others.

00:07:00.385 --> 00:07:08.001
Not to be sarcastic by any chance,
nor to be harsh, but be sweet.

00:07:08.026 --> 00:07:13.212
Sweetness which is genuine, not outward
and showing and formal,

00:07:13.237 --> 00:07:17.793
but genuine sweetness.
May God bless you all.
