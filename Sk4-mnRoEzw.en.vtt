THE ASPECTS OF VISHUDDHI CHAKRA (PART 1 and 2)

00:00:17.508 --> 00:00:21.649
So now the other center which we have
here is very important center,

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.508
called as the Vishuddhi Chakra. This is
the center Vi-shuddha.

00:00:26.709 --> 00:00:32.227
One is “shuddha”, means “pure”, but
“vishuddha” means “absolutely pure”.

00:00:32.427 --> 00:00:39.258
This has got sixteen petals, as we have got
the cervical plexus expressed in the gross,

00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:47.014
which has also got sixteen sub-plexuses.
It tallies with medical science completely.

00:00:47.591 --> 00:00:52.766
Now let us see how this Vishuddhi Chakra
made is.

00:00:52.967 --> 00:00:58.992
All the vowels that we use come
from Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:00:59.209 --> 00:01:04.537
And like in Devanagari language it is

00:01:04.738 --> 00:01:12.299
A AA - I II - U UU - E AI - O AU

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.635
RU RUU - LRU LRUU - AM AHA.

00:01:16.836 --> 00:01:23.074
So as you know that you cannot compile
a word without a vowel, is so important.

00:01:23.275 --> 00:01:29.220
The consonant is weak,

00:01:29.421 --> 00:01:35.068
without - nirbal [weak], without
any strength, without the vowel.

00:01:35.269 --> 00:01:41.262
So the strength of a person

00:01:41.463 --> 00:01:45.113
comes through the Vishuddhi Chakra
in his speech.

00:01:45.475 --> 00:01:49.628
Is the center, what we call, here,
is the Vishuddhi Chakra,

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.946
is the center where human beings raised
their head up.

00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:57.079
This is the center that has made us
a human being,

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.509
and from this center only rises the ego
and superego,

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.681
because this is the center of collectivity.

00:02:04.882 --> 00:02:08.329
Because we speak through this center,
we talk through this,

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.259
we have rapport with other people through
this, and as a reaction to that,

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.970
ego and superego is built within us.

00:02:16.171 --> 00:02:20.353
When that is built within us, we become
a personality –

00:02:20.554 --> 00:02:28.758
I am some, he is some, you are some.
At that point we become

00:02:29.067 --> 00:02:34.477
a person who has the consciousness
of I-ness.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.321
Like then I’ll say “I like this, I want
this.”

00:02:39.522 --> 00:02:43.220
Say, I will say “I’m an Indian,” you’ll say
“I’m an Englishman.”

00:02:43.421 --> 00:02:48.242
All these misidentifications start because
you become an individual

00:02:48.443 --> 00:02:51.525
who tries to identify with many things.

00:02:51.726 --> 00:02:56.228
That's how we become separated
from that power.

00:02:56.429 --> 00:03:01.287
This is the freedom we get, where
we have to ourselves

00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:06.110
learn from our errors and trials what is
right and what is wrong.

00:03:07.063 --> 00:03:11.183
This Vishuddhi Chakra is, has got sixteen
petals and looks after

00:03:11.384 --> 00:03:14.589
our ear, nose, eyes, throat, everything.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.096
Our face, everything is looked after
by this center.

00:03:19.297 --> 00:03:22.808
Now this center also has left and right –
all centers have left and right –

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:27.894
and when you feel guilty the left center
catches,

00:03:28.095 --> 00:03:32.659
which is a very dangerous thing because
this gives you diseases like angina,

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.940
or maybe diseases like spondylitis and
lethargic organs.

00:03:38.141 --> 00:03:40.245
Right – when a person is very aggressive,

00:03:40.446 --> 00:03:44.393
talks very aggressively and tries
to dominate others

00:03:44.594 --> 00:03:50.933
and use his power of speech to show off,
the right side catches.

00:03:51.134 --> 00:03:54.980
The reactions of this can be many:
that the hand gets frozen,

00:03:55.181 --> 00:03:58.175
and they also get the cancer of the throat;

00:03:58.376 --> 00:04:03.963
all kinds of things can happen with this
chakra being in trouble.

00:04:13.608 --> 00:04:19.739
Now a person who shouts and screams
and talks loudly

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:29.521
and loses his temper in a very loud voice,
or who speaks very loudly all the time,

00:04:29.722 --> 00:04:34.136
they all suffer from the right Vishuddhi.

00:04:34.337 --> 00:04:39.900
So one should understand that even when
you have to scold somebody,

00:04:40.101 --> 00:04:43.448
you have to just say, "What are you doing?
Why are you doing like this?"

00:04:43.649 --> 00:04:46.315
Otherwise: "Why did you do like this?!?"

00:04:46.516 --> 00:04:51.070
Finished, Right Vishuddhi, over.
It’s finished now.

00:04:51.868 --> 00:04:54.860
Now this is the thing is.
On the right side

00:04:55.061 --> 00:05:01.026
if you are talking loudly, if you talk
too much,

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:10.262
if you intimidate people with your talking,
then you catch on right Vishuddhi.

00:05:10.463 --> 00:05:13.756
So for that best is to take some rest

00:05:13.957 --> 00:05:19.418
and give some rest to your right Vishuddhi
by stopping your talk.

00:05:19.619 --> 00:05:22.947
Go into mauna they say, just don't talk.

00:05:23.148 --> 00:05:25.815
For some time if you don't talk
you will see that

00:05:26.016 --> 00:05:29.676
your Vishuddhi will be improved,
your problems will be improved.

00:05:29.877 --> 00:05:33.479
So what is the divine diplomacy?

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.018
You don't have to shout, but you change
the subject.

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:46.702
If you want to bring somebody to a,
some conclusion -

00:05:46.903 --> 00:05:49.913
then best thing is first you change
the subject

00:05:50.114 --> 00:05:55.202
and gradually, if you are clever enough,
then you go on changing, changing

00:05:55.403 --> 00:06:02.764
and you bring it back to the right thing.
That's the clever thing to do.

00:06:06.777 --> 00:06:11.538
What is the essence of this diplomacy?

00:06:17.792 --> 00:06:20.460
Is benevolence.

00:06:20.661 --> 00:06:26.843
You have to achieve the benevolence
of the whole humanity.

00:06:27.044 --> 00:06:31.710
This is the essence of it. If you are
doing it, you are not doing for yourself,

00:06:31.911 --> 00:06:35.569
for your gain. You are not doing
for the gain of any particular person.

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:41.468
But you are doing it for the benevolence
of the whole humanity.

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:46.772
So once you know this is the essence,
so what is the need to shout?

00:06:46.973 --> 00:06:49.812
By shouting you are not going to achieve
anything.

00:06:50.013 --> 00:06:55.350
So to play around with it and bring it
to that point which is benevolence.

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:01.437
So our Right Vishuddhi we have to have

00:07:02.606 --> 00:07:09.277
a temperament, a culture, a style,
a behavior

00:07:09.478 --> 00:07:12.851
which has got the quality (…) which is
called as madhurya,

00:07:13.052 --> 00:07:16.775
means melodious, melodious.

00:07:16.976 --> 00:07:22.267
We should talk in such a manner that
it should be melodious.

00:07:22.468 --> 00:07:26.926
The voice of a Sahaja yogi should be
sweet like that.

00:07:27.127 --> 00:07:32.772
When you talk to someone it should be
melodious.

00:07:32.973 --> 00:07:38.662
It should not be aggressive, at all, but
on the contrary it should be melodious.

00:07:38.863 --> 00:07:43.021
It should not be sarcastic; it should not
hurt another person.

00:07:43.222 --> 00:07:50.968
Any word that hurts others cannot be coming
from the proper type of Right Vishuddhi.

00:07:51.169 --> 00:07:55.797
So in no way one should hurt.

00:07:56.295 --> 00:08:04.500
The another quality which we can express
through our Right Vishuddhi, is diplomacy.

00:08:04.709 --> 00:08:09.703
But there are two types of diplomacies:
one is genuine; one who is artificial.

00:08:09.904 --> 00:08:16.727
In the genuine diplomacy you do not have
to take to a certain standard

00:08:16.928 --> 00:08:23.016
or you don’t have to read some books
to know what is diplomacy.

00:08:23.287 --> 00:08:30.861
Is a - genuinely it comes to you. It,
the whole thing works very sweetly,

00:08:31.062 --> 00:08:33.746
in such a genuine manner.

00:08:33.947 --> 00:08:39.625
I, I’ve used it many-a-times Myself, and
you all can use it also many-a-times.

00:08:39.826 --> 00:08:46.743
That’s only possible if you don’t get angry
with them; not possible if you are angry.

00:08:56.263 --> 00:09:01.313
Relationship between brothers and sisters
has to be established. They’re very pure.

00:09:01.515 --> 00:09:07.523
Brothers and sisters relationship is
without any lust or greed.

00:09:08.536 --> 00:09:16.185
It’s pure relationship where the sister
prays for the protection of the brother,

00:09:16.386 --> 00:09:29.029
and brother prays for the self-sufficiency
of the kshema – well-being - of the sister.

00:09:30.917 --> 00:09:36.163
So this time you have to think of your
other Sahaja Yoginis

00:09:36.364 --> 00:09:42.311
and Sahaja Yogis who are like your brothers
and sisters.

00:09:42.512 --> 00:09:47.319
You have to think like that. Purify
your hearts.

00:09:47.569 --> 00:09:50.314
It’s something funny in these countries,
you know that,

00:09:50.395 --> 00:09:54.093
there’s no such relationship exists.

00:09:54.335 --> 00:09:57.630
Purify your mind today on that point,

00:09:57.831 --> 00:10:02.997
that everybody else is my brother
or sister.

00:10:03.182 --> 00:10:07.341
If you are married it’s all right. But look
at everyone,

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:10.138
try to look at everyone as a brother,
and a sister.

00:10:10.862 --> 00:10:18.130
When the sister, who is your pure relation,

00:10:19.049 --> 00:10:22.372
is not treated as a sister,

00:10:22.573 --> 00:10:29.208
when the attitude of a person towards women

00:10:29.409 --> 00:10:38.371
is of indulgence and of lust, then
he develops the Left Vishuddhi.

00:10:38.572 --> 00:10:45.483
When he develops a Left Vishuddhi very
strongly, and if he has a bad Agnya,

00:10:45.668 --> 00:10:48.709
or if he has eyes which are roving eyes,

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:52.397
then this Left Vishuddhi causes lot
of trouble.

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:54.707
Left Vishuddhi can be also caused

00:10:54.869 --> 00:10:59.965
by, as you know, by feeling guilty about
things for nothing at all.

00:11:00.324 --> 00:11:03.996
All these problems arise from Vishuddhi.

00:11:04.415 --> 00:11:11.418
The left-side center is caught up when
a person feels guilty

00:11:14.853 --> 00:11:18.887
and obstructs the ascent of the Kundalini.

00:11:21.186 --> 00:11:24.301
That’s why I always request all
the Western seekers

00:11:24.502 --> 00:11:31.676
first to say in their hearts, “Mother,
I’m not guilty.”

00:11:36.718 --> 00:11:41.199
These are the conditionings that have
come to us

00:11:43.205 --> 00:11:49.637
from so-called religions, from so-called
psychologists,

00:11:49.838 --> 00:11:56.118
and other people who are responsible
for our development in our childhood.

00:12:00.068 --> 00:12:05.399
When material things [were] very important
for the parents,

00:12:08.193 --> 00:12:11.757
they all the time shout at children
or correct them, saying that,

00:12:11.967 --> 00:12:17.493
“Don’t spoil the carpet, don’t spoil that,
don’t spoil that”,

00:12:22.951 --> 00:12:29.572
and that is how we develop a kind
of a guilt within us.

00:12:31.236 --> 00:12:34.064
When we grow up in the schools
and colleges,

00:12:34.265 --> 00:12:39.318
this can be built up very heavily
within us, too.

00:12:44.709 --> 00:12:53.124
So how much important it is to understand
the value of left Vishuddhi.

00:12:53.325 --> 00:12:56.958
All of us catch on left Vishuddhi,
and we do not think

00:12:57.159 --> 00:12:58.930
that it is such an important thing.

00:12:59.131 --> 00:13:01.451
But we say, “Oh, left Vishuddhi catching
means I’m feeling guilty.”

00:13:01.652 --> 00:13:04.248
We do not understand that “What have
I done?

00:13:04.449 --> 00:13:09.177
I have crossed the limits, that’s why
is showing there.

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:12.545
I’ve neglected some kind of a morality.

00:13:12.746 --> 00:13:17.482
I’ve gone on a wrong path against
Mother and Father,

00:13:17.683 --> 00:13:19.795
that’s why left Vishuddhi is catching.”

00:13:19.996 --> 00:13:27.647
Left Vishuddhi is the indication of
the mistakes, of the wrongs, of the sins.

00:13:27.848 --> 00:13:30.272
We can’t afford to have left Vishuddhi,

00:13:30.473 --> 00:13:33.203
Sahaja yogis cannot afford to have
left Vishuddhi.

00:13:33.871 --> 00:13:40.511
Now what I have seen that when this
negativity starts acting,

00:13:40.712 --> 00:13:44.157
people, instead of facing it, facing
the mistakes that

00:13:44.358 --> 00:13:47.969
“I’m wrong, I should not have done it,
it’s a wrong thing to do,”

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:51.860
start giving explanations. Once you start
giving explanation,

00:13:52.061 --> 00:13:58.993
this left Vishuddhi starts becoming like
a bloated big lump,

00:13:59.194 --> 00:14:04.265
and then there’s no possibility of curing
you, no possibility of cleansing you.

00:14:04.466 --> 00:14:08.610
So people start giving explanation,
“Why I did it, why I did this.”

00:14:08.811 --> 00:14:11.563
Once it is said is wrong, is wrong;

00:14:11.764 --> 00:14:16.274
to be accepted, “All right, next time I’m
not going to do it, I’m very sorry.”

00:14:17.356 --> 00:14:22.236
But in the center when you rise - the Kundalini rises -

00:14:22.377 --> 00:14:27.882
most of the people have their Vishuddhi caught up, most of the people.

00:14:27.963 --> 00:14:30.488
So they have to either see that they are not guilty

00:14:30.569 --> 00:14:34.457
or they have to see that there is no shouting - nothing -

00:14:34.539 --> 00:14:39.613
they are not aggressive in their shouts. And, plus, they have to see

00:14:39.694 --> 00:14:44.254
that they are completely in balance with themselves.

00:14:44.335 --> 00:14:50.488
So they are in the central path by which they become sweet, kind and nice.

00:14:51.904 --> 00:14:54.542
So for us it is important to understand

00:14:54.623 --> 00:14:58.335
that our Vishuddhi is to be kept clear, first of all

00:14:58.416 --> 00:15:02.322
we must have a beautiful heart, a very clean heart.

00:15:02.403 --> 00:15:07.392
And find out what's wrong with you, get it corrected -

00:15:07.473 --> 00:15:14.621
which can be done by anyone - and see that you just have

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:19.785
a full idea about yourself, about your Vishuddhi.

00:15:19.866 --> 00:15:23.418
And that's only possible, only - again it's a vicious circle -

00:15:23.499 --> 00:15:25.996
if you have a good Vishuddhi.

00:15:26.077 --> 00:15:29.066
If you don't have a good Vishuddhi you can never see yourself

00:15:29.147 --> 00:15:33.394
because at the Vishuddhi point only you become the witness.

00:15:33.475 --> 00:15:36.629
You are just a witness when you are at a Vishuddhi point.

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:40.316
So you have to be at the Vishuddhi a witness.

00:15:40.397 --> 00:15:43.746
If you have achieved the witness nature

00:15:43.827 --> 00:15:47.927
then you can see in your Vishuddhi what's wrong with you,

00:15:48.008 --> 00:15:52.654
what's wrong with your problems, with your atmosphere, everything,

00:15:52.735 --> 00:15:57.519
and you will end up here only, thinking: "Oh, this is the one that is wrong."

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:04.848
Now the main problem before us today is something else.

00:16:04.929 --> 00:16:17.807
Is that we all have to ascend, and ascend with an equal strength.

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:29.066
There’s a story about some birds who were caught in a net,

00:16:29.147 --> 00:16:34.480
so they decided that we should get out of this net, and they tried.

00:16:34.561 --> 00:16:40.124
Everybody tried to get out. But nobody individually could work it out.

00:16:40.205 --> 00:16:45.030
So they all decided to fly together, “One, two, three, and go!”,

00:16:45.111 --> 00:16:53.274
and they took all that net with them. And they said, then they requested the rats

00:16:53.355 --> 00:17:01.455
that “Please come and cut our net”, and they were freed.

00:17:02.236 --> 00:17:08.835
So if it can happen between the rats and the birds, why not between us?

00:17:08.916 --> 00:17:16.555
So in collectivity, you’ll be amazed in the collectivity how we could be helpful

00:17:16.636 --> 00:17:22.225
and joyous with each other. Now say something is wrong

00:17:22.306 --> 00:17:26.772
with your mother, father, sister, somebody, doesn’t matter.

00:17:26.853 --> 00:17:31.686
After all you have the Ocean of Joy here with the collectivity,

00:17:31.767 --> 00:17:35.098
and your problems can be solved if collectively,

00:17:35.179 --> 00:17:38.279
if you want to solve your problem.

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:45.358
So we have to depend on the collectivity. Very much to be one with the collective.

00:17:45.439 --> 00:17:50.842
I feel once you jump into the sea of Sahaj,

00:17:50.923 --> 00:17:57.553
the joy itself draws you together. Meeting each other is such a joyous thing.

00:17:57.634 --> 00:18:02.357
We have had so many experiences of that, of Sahaja Yogis who have told me

00:18:02.438 --> 00:18:07.263
how happy they were to find Sahaja Yogis somewhere

00:18:07.344 --> 00:18:11.858
out of the blue, and how they felt happy.

00:18:11.939 --> 00:18:21.504
So this tie between the Sahaja Yogis is really the most joyous channel,

00:18:21.969 --> 00:18:28.294
and that is what is the source we should say, of our becoming one together.

00:18:29.272 --> 00:18:32.330
Once you start enjoying each other…

00:18:32.411 --> 00:18:36.161
Collectivity doesn’t mean that we all should be stuck together

00:18:36.242 --> 00:18:42.431
with some glue or something, or we all become like Gibraltar,

00:18:43.312 --> 00:18:46.810
Rock of Gibraltar. No, it doesn’t mean that.

00:18:46.891 --> 00:18:53.285
It means wherever you are, you are connected. That is collectivity.

00:18:54.549 --> 00:18:58.607
But if you are not connected and you are just glued together,

00:18:58.688 --> 00:19:04.086
it’s very inconvenient to live under such circumstances.

00:19:04.812 --> 00:19:09.298
I think, people don’t even understand the meaning of collectivity -

00:19:10.484 --> 00:19:16.389
where there’s not the other, Ananya. Where there’s not the other,

00:19:17.567 --> 00:19:21.376
there’s no other personality.

00:19:22.754 --> 00:19:26.113
These personalities

00:19:26.348 --> 00:19:33.349
are separated from you because of left and right. Or could be both.

00:19:37.075 --> 00:19:43.528
But you are yourself fully when you are absolutely detached

00:19:43.653 --> 00:19:50.800
and your Kundalini is dancing – you are alone and never alone.

00:19:57.058 --> 00:20:03.676
This oneness with the whole gives you

00:20:04.848 --> 00:20:10.016
all the security that you want, all the joy you want.

00:20:12.051 --> 00:20:18.802
And that’s why Kundalini Awakening means "collectivity".

00:20:19.884 --> 00:20:30.147
Unless and until you want pure collectivity in your being, Kundalini won’t rise.

00:20:40.549 --> 00:20:50.449
Now this chakra is - it is, you know, placed between the two eyebrows.

00:20:53.004 --> 00:20:57.182
Now, two eyes represent the left and the right side.

00:21:01.278 --> 00:21:09.605
So this center is very much guided by our eyes,

00:21:10.156 --> 00:21:19.510
by our ears, by our nose, tongue, teeth, throat.

00:21:22.366 --> 00:21:28.032
Is a very important center because the Vishuddhi,

00:21:28.113 --> 00:21:36.236
which has to look after sixteen petals, which sixteen petals which look after

00:21:36.441 --> 00:21:42.652
all these ear, nose, throat, different, different organs within us,

00:21:43.659 --> 00:21:48.475
also it has to communicate with the Virat.

00:21:49.175 --> 00:21:55.391
So it has to pass through this center of Hamsa Chakra.

00:22:01.374 --> 00:22:10.161
Hamsa Chakra is the very pivotal center

00:22:11.475 --> 00:22:19.286
which expresses auspiciousness in our awareness.

00:22:19.749 --> 00:22:26.403
That means if this center is alert and awakened,

00:22:26.484 --> 00:22:31.917
then we immediately know what is auspicious and what is not auspicious.

00:22:32.242 --> 00:22:37.574
Or we can call it - we get the Divine Discretion.

00:22:38.765 --> 00:22:50.282
I think it is a part of the genetics that people have discretion

00:22:52.233 --> 00:22:59.550
between good and bad, destructive and constructive.

00:23:11.233 --> 00:23:14.623
Virat is the ultimate,

00:23:15.015 --> 00:23:19.825
the complete development of the Vishuddhi chakra is Virat.

00:23:19.906 --> 00:23:26.342
And as you know the chakra is here, here at this point.

00:23:27.701 --> 00:23:33.098
If this chakra is not all right, you are not collective.

00:23:33.389 --> 00:23:37.761
You behave in a manner that is not collective.

00:23:37.842 --> 00:23:44.175
You cannot communicate with other Sahaja yogis.

00:23:44.982 --> 00:23:53.404
You cannot be friendly, loving and one with other Sahaja yogis,

00:23:54.387 --> 00:24:00.026
unless and until this center here, Vishuddhi, is all right.

00:24:00.107 --> 00:24:03.276
And it is part of Ekadasha.

00:24:03.357 --> 00:24:08.559
Vishuddhi is the center of the Ekadasha Rudra.

00:24:09.981 --> 00:24:16.933
The discretion power becomes so beautiful of the Hamsa Chakra,

00:24:17.795 --> 00:24:22.247
because they are all connected, the Vishuddhi, Hamsa and Virata.

00:24:22.404 --> 00:24:26.966
They are all connected centers.

00:24:27.333 --> 00:24:34.689
It’s not only that the Virata improves, but Vishuddhi improves and Hamsa.

00:24:36.558 --> 00:24:42.124
So now what happens that you jump into collectivity.

00:24:42.702 --> 00:24:48.478
And the love and the affection and the understanding

00:24:48.559 --> 00:24:56.821
that you have for each other is remarkable, is very enjoyable and very beautiful.

00:24:58.023 --> 00:25:04.503
So all that happens, absolutely happens in your brain.

00:25:04.757 --> 00:25:15.230
That’s how your brain, which is the one which receives all the information

00:25:15.325 --> 00:25:19.121
and creates all the information,

00:25:19.202 --> 00:25:26.379
creates all the mental projections becomes a new vehicle

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:33.674
to create a dimension which goes higher, not declining.

00:25:34.701 --> 00:25:38.572
All of you are part and parcel of that, all of you

00:25:38.653 --> 00:25:43.862
are part and parcel of that and all of you are important.

00:25:43.943 --> 00:25:50.621
All of you have to support that, all of you have to raise it. It is very important;

00:25:50.702 --> 00:25:57.572
you all should understand your own responsibility.

00:25:58.356 --> 00:26:05.582
And after Sahaja Yoga, after enlightenment, all the subtleties

00:26:05.663 --> 00:26:12.400
of the brain and the knowledge starts manifesting and expressing itself.

00:26:12.481 --> 00:26:16.806
But the greatest thing that happens, that integration takes place in your brain.

00:26:16.887 --> 00:26:21.416
It’s not that your heart wants one thing and your brain wants another thing.

00:26:21.497 --> 00:26:25.158
The integration takes place. And when that integration takes place

00:26:25.239 --> 00:26:28.901
it’s so easy to lead a very dharmic life.

00:26:28.982 --> 00:26:35.681
Even without thinking about it, without
reading about it, you just become dharmic.

00:26:35.762 --> 00:26:40.215
You are not to be told that you have to
be dharmic. Innately you become dharmic

00:26:40.295 --> 00:26:46.502
because your brain, which normally is used for rationality,

00:26:46.583 --> 00:26:53.706
for justifying all that is wrong, becomes dharmic, becomes divine.

00:26:53.971 --> 00:26:59.071
So this is what one has to realize, that after realization

00:26:59.152 --> 00:27:02.936
a person gets ideas which are always constructive.

00:27:03.017 --> 00:27:06.882
And if they are not, then you are not yet a Sahaja yogi.

00:27:06.975 --> 00:27:13.069
Constructive and dharmic - that is very, very important for us

00:27:13.150 --> 00:27:18.866
to understand, where is our mind going? Is it contradicting,

00:27:18.947 --> 00:27:24.501
it is telling something else than what it is?

00:27:24.582 --> 00:27:29.212
We have to just keep a-watch and you’ll be amazed to see

00:27:29.293 --> 00:27:33.744
how your brain has changed its ways.

00:27:33.825 --> 00:27:37.821
The upside brain has become normal.

00:27:37.902 --> 00:27:46.978
This you can get very easily if you just meditate every day

00:27:47.059 --> 00:27:53.203
and see for yourself how the expression of your Sahastrara

00:27:53.284 --> 00:28:00.209
is penetrating into your being and is acting in your life.

00:28:00.290 --> 00:28:04.688
Then all the powers of Sahaja yogi will be manifested

00:28:04.769 --> 00:28:11.053
and you don’t have to anymore doubt yourself,
and others will never doubt you.

00:28:11.767 --> 00:28:13.860
May God bless you.
