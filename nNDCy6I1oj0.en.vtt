00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.620
One electromagnetic energy that you have.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.880
What we call as a “Prana”

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.200
It is the energy from 5 elements.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.920
It has the energy by which we are today human beings from amoeba

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.980
and it has the energy which creates desires within us.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.440
It has the energy that can cure us

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.600
and redeems us

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:29.620
and the energy that can give us powers so we can do living work.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:50.740
Sahaja yoga is with that energy which is in totality complete consciousness,

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:14.060
and it is a special time today. You can say in modern times, and there are so many people who are trying to think beyond,

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.460
we can say it is meta modernism,

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.380
no, no, meta modernism

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:51.220
and that is something which shows the wisdom of people who understand that we have to go beyond

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:10.500
and they are not satisfied with what they are but they have to go beyond

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:30.180
and there are so many who feel that their awareness is to be expanded.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:51.740
In this short time as much as possible I am trying to give you a general picture about Sahaja yoga.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.060
“Saha” means “with”, and “ja” is born,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.740
so it is born with you to have this union with that all-pervading power, Sahaja you have.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.180
It works on all living beings

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.100
and also on energies.

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:55.220
For example, you can improve your agriculture in Sahaja yoga 10 times more,

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:11.740
you can improve your ecological problem through Sahaja yoga,

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:30.200
you can make your animals much more healthier through Sahaja yoga

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:40.200
and you yourself become so dynamic

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.620
and so compassionate

00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:10.940
that a scientist becomes a person who works only with all the understanding of limitations of science

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.400
and helps to create a new world.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:35.900
I must say all the scientific discoveries have helped Sahaja yoga greatly.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:48.940
Supposing there were no aeroplanes I did not have come to see you

00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:00.700
if there were no microphones I could not have talked to you

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.400
and these microphones also carry vibrations.

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:19.080
Even on television one can give realization to people.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:32.740
So all these discoveries you have made has been of such a great help to Sahaja yoga.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:46.940
We have developed the watches to save time,

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:59.300
we save our time to waste it mostly,

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:13.020
and after self-realization, we use it for our spiritual ascent and spiritual growth, growth through meditation.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:36.740
So I am very much thankful to you all scientists for making these devices which have made it possible to spread Sahajayoga all over the world.

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:54.740
The knowledge of Sahaja yoga is very deep,

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:02.440
our civilization has grown like a big tree,

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:12.580
but knowledge of Sahaja yoga is the knowledge of the roots

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:26.940
and if you do not have the knowledge of the roots this great development will be one day under a shock.

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:44.560
So it is important for us to know the knowledge of the roots if we have to survive

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:56.240
and to enjoy the blessings of science.

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:11.380
I am sorry in this short time I cannot say much but I will be very happy to answer your questions if you have any.

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:55.180
As a scientist, you have to understand everything whatever you do,

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:04.980
if somebody cures you and cannot explain how

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:13.460
then you should not accept as a scientist.

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.580
but I know that what happens.

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:29.940
This is something which is not dealt with by scientists so far,

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:42.000
only in the scriptures they have talked about the soul,

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:57.640
now soul, whatever I am telling you, again, you should accept it as a hypothesis.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:17.080
Now soul is a composition of 5 elements, the causal of 5 elements

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:30.280
which is placed on the back side of our...it’s an energy form, it’s an energy form

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:39.180
and is placed on the backside of our spinal cord in 7 loops…

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:59.840
after self-realization you can even see the all-pervading power like small commas shining like light,

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:19.200
also you see a kind of loops circular things

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:32.200
and the Sahaja yogis ask Me: what is this?

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:39.900
I told them these are dead souls.

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:49.780
Now for example we talk of psychosomatic diseases,

00:14:55.300 --> 00:15:03.320
also doctors have reached a certain point of understanding that most of the psychosomatic diseases

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:12.940
are caused by something that comes from our collective subconscious.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:38.780
For example, cancer they say is triggered by a protein 53 and 58. It’s a name they've got.

00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:06.520
And they say that it comes from the area which is built within us since our creation,

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:24.120
now, this area which is built within us is the area which we call as collective subconsciousness,

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:52.120
so all the plants which have gone out of the circulation of evolution or who have gone out of the circulation are all existing in that area of collective subconscious,

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:27.060
so when a person who practices what we call as black magic or mesmerism also uses the dead souls

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:33.160
which are around to captivate you.

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:51.980
And people do mesmerize without knowing what effects it will have on human beings.

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:06.840
Now what happens that if you put any such spirit, it can be without the knowledge

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:17.740
of the person who is doing it automatically. It becomes like a [ ] and then the spirit gets out to your system,

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:42.840
now recently they have found out in the science, scientific research that we have all got receptors

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:52.440
and in the receptors these seven loops that I am telling you about are reflected exactly the same way

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:57.080
I have seen..if you have seen the picture in the same that you see.

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:25.440
And when there are on these loops if there is any effect then what you call as dopamine is created.

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:38.620
Dopamine is a kind of a chemical which gives you epilepsy, it can give you madness can give you all mental problems also other virus and cancer, psychosomatic.

00:19:56.620 --> 00:20:04.560
So I, I didn’t know that I would talk to scientists otherwise I would have brought these papers which I have got from America.

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:24.160
So we had about 10 people yesterday, who came from the same gentleman and were suffering from many diseases.

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:42.780
Some had their hands stuck like that they couldn’t walk, some children suddenly stopped talking,

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:48.420
some got their eyes completely scooped in, some got the brain paralysis.

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:15.620
So what happens that you can put one of their or many of these dead spirits on your back on the soul,

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:29.640
and they take over

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:42.180
and when they take over when they try to assert their personality,

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:56.760
so for the time being one may feel elated because there are so many personalities acting for a while,

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:10.140
but after sometime that person becomes exhausted and they recluse...

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:26.320
This is followed by many false gurus in India, we know about it very well because just

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:29.180
this black magic is too much in India.

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:50.880
But mainly what one has to know, I would say that as a Mother I would say what did you get out of it?

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:05.960
Only temporary curing is not the aim of life,

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:19.800
but you have to be empowered and you have to have full knowledge as to what you are going to be.

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:32.940
In Sahaja yoga you know all about the centres and it can be good to you.

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:43.040
You can even see with your naked eyes the pulsation of the kundalini,

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:48.660
this power which connects you to the mains.

00:23:56.380 --> 00:24:00.240
You can see also sometimes the rising of the kundalini

00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:10.220
you can feel the cool breeze coming out of your head, the actualisation of it,

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:19.320
and you can feel the all-pervading power.

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:34.660
You may be a doctor may not be a doctor but you can give diagnose to others what centres are in trouble.

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:48.300
There are three channels

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:54.200
which look after the sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system,

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:03.620
and you can control them,

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:09.360
you can control your parasympathetic nervous system,

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:16.680
you can raise the kundalini of others,

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:21.580
you can cure others,

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:29.780
yourself you feel extremely peaceful, joyous and happy,

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:42.320
because you develop a new dimension of collective consciousness which Jung has written.

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:54.920
So you become complete knowledgeable like a laboratory you know everything,

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:06.840
it is not just "ah, it is happening. I don’t know how happening" - nothing of that kind...everything can be explained,

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:15.660
everything becomes logical,

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:25.940
so anything that just cures you is not sufficient,

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:36.680
in India this art is very well developed

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:48.420
but we know about it so much that we now don’t go to any false people,

00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:57.520
so now they are exported all to America,

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.780
They are very gullible

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:07.160
Americans are very gullible people,

00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:15.880
and these people have only interest in money they are money makers.

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:23.140
Now it’s a living process,

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.640
how can you pay for a living process,

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:35.860
how much do we pay to Mother Earth for sprouting a seed?

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:45.160
These people have all their interest in money,

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:54.840
and not in giving you the powers

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:01.280
and the knowledge

00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:04.800
because they haven’t got it.

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:16.640
So first of all you must see

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:24.880
what are the disciples like?

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.620
What do they do?

00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:38.080
What sort age they are? What sort of body they have?

00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:42.700
How do they talk?

00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:46.880
What is their health?

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:51.520
Do they know about all this?

00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:56.960
Can they explain it?

00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:01.460
How is their own life?

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:05.460
You can find out.

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:08.980
They have to be honest

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:13.220
and they have to be compassionate,

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:17.960
so be careful,

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:27.580
so many will come once you have lots of money, there will be a market,

00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:36.620
so before anything happen, be careful.

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:45.520
I am a Mother and you have asked me the question I have to tell you the Truth.

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:56.940
Eighteen years back I have told this Truth but they would not listen to Me,

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:09.380
In America I told them about AIDS, I told them about UPI disease is going to come,

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:14.300
I told them about so many diseases they would not listen and now they are down with it.

00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:28.280
So what can you do if they don’t want to listen to you, you can’t help it.

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:39.340
If they are bent upon their destruction then what can you do? They have all the freedom.

00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:54.820
Or somebody asked me how to go to hell, all types of questions they ask,

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:03.440
I said take two running jumps and you are there.

00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:13.960
So it is like this,

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:21.240
For getting your realization you have to first ask for it, I have to respect your freedom

00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:28.640
and it’s not a guarantee that you will get it at first shot.

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:43.000
But if you are earnest it will work out

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:54.580
and then once you are fully connected, no problems of any kind.

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:03.400
I found Russians to be very wise people,

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:16.660
and I feel that a day will come when Russians will be most powerful people spiritually.

00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:29.280
The country is not powerful by weapons but by the powerful peoples.

00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:04.120
I have to .. his question is still not answered.

00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:19.820
After realization, we become very sensible and satisfied people,

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:27.600
and we develop a balance

00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:36.960
then we realize that the machines are for us and we are not for machines

00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:48.400
so we produce as much as we want,

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:59.200
and whatever is necessary we produce through machines or we produce through our hands.

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:07.160
So a balance is.

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:16.000
As a result of that, the pollution goes down.

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:28.980
Now in Spain there are five motor factories,

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:50.000
now on the road you will find in car only one person is sitting, in every car,

00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:05.640
because so many cars are produced every day, cars are cheap so they buy a car and an ego is saying: now I've got a car!

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:29.720
The father must have one car, mother must have one car, the child must have one car, the grandmother must have one car

00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:36.200
and they never meet each other,

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:40.960
no rapport, no relationship,

00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:51.820
they live with their cars with their pretty girls and with a suitcase.

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:03.720
So, after realization we become collective,

00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:12.260
there may be three cars but everybody would like to go together in one car,

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:19.400
they want to live collectively

00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:24.640
because they enjoy each other.

00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:30.480
Now Sahaja yoga is working in forty nations,

00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:38.040
and they want to live in Indian villages,

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:52.180
And light it with a spark. I mean you cannot do anything there,

00:36:54.100 --> 00:37:03.740
but they enjoy it having their baths in the flowing rivers and living in the nature absolutely very happy and comfortable.

00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:21.200
They wear few clothes of cotton or pure silk or cotton whatever they can afford, not too many things they don’t have in their house

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:31.520
like plastics,

00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:39.860
mountains and mountains

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:44.640
and they don’t know how to destroy it,

00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:49.780
and Sahaja yogis don’t drink,

00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:54.940
so only one glass is sufficient for one man,

00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:03.420
for drinking we have to have one..., another one, another one, another one,

00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:14.000
and too many choices because of ego.

00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:21.900
In the morning the mother will ask what will you have?

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:29.000
One child will say this, another this another that,

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:37.880
and if that is not in the fridge the child will start shouting,

00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:47.280
Formally the mother used to cook for everyone the same thing

00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:54.800
and everybody had to eat that and enjoy it,

00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:04.380
because we have lost our collective enjoyment, we have become like this.

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:16.200
Now these entrepreneurs are also making fool of us,

00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:32.400
first they will start that you should wear very tight pants,

00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:45.940
so you develop varicose veins,

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:54.280
so they will say alright make pants with holes in it

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:03.580
so everybody starts wearing them,

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:09.560
they go on changing fashions because their machines have to run,

00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:21.900
and we have no personality, we all want to be fashionable, what is the need?

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:31.440
So we have piles of clothes,

00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:44.220
you go to an English home, as soon as you enter all pile will fall on you first of all.

00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:55.540
So, this matter is only for one purpose,

00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:01.620
is for expressing your love,

00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:07.260
like today we had a birthday,

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:13.020
so we gave him a tea set,

00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:19.820
and I got some necklaces for all of you,

00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:27.600
and I enjoy very much giving them,

00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:35.280
that’s the only advantage of matter,

00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:43.000
otherwise possessions are headaches.

00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:55.660
So, how ecological problems has come by? Because of greed and lust.

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:12.160
After Sahaja yoga, you get everything beautiful and enjoy everything,

00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:31.220
because you feel that this has become a holy water now, everything becomes holy, auspicious,

00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:43.540
only thing which are auspicious, which emit vibrations Sahaja yogis will have it,

00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:51.660
all auspicious things are benevolent

00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:59.320
so the ecological problem is solved.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:54.680
So first question is that some diseases can be cured through Sahaja yoga  - as raising the kundalini.

00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:19.300
Yesterday there was a lady with multiple sclerosis. And she could not stand on her..

00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:33.580
and we raised her kundalini, she had problems on her centres,

00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:41.320
we corrected the centres raised her kundalini, gave her realization and she got alright,

00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:59.600
and then she still [ ] that she was sick so she was holding onto the chair

00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:06.540
I said now you get up and walk, and she then started walking so fast, everybody saw.

00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:22.060
Most of them get cured,

00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:26.040
but some of them do not.

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:46.020
Now, first of all, you have to get your self-realization,

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:52.860
then you have to come to our collective program

00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:59.000
and then you have to master Sahaja yoga

00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:07.000
when you start do it, then you can cure others.

00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:12.100
But Sahaja yoga is not for curing,

00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:16.460
it is for self-realization

00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:22.460
and when you get your self-realization as a bioproduct

00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:35.160
then you can become alright because when the kundalini rises She passes through these centres and nourishes them.

00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:11.040
Shri Mataji, if there were some psychological research done relating to influence Sahaja Yoga on people?

00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:22.480
Is it possible to see the findings of this research? And may I get Your blessing to conduct such research in center of Sahaja Yoga in Moscow?

00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:17.220
...here accepted for research but if you want to do it otherwise you can do it by using Sahaja yoga methods

00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:32.440
to cure people who are suffering from psychosomatic diseases or depressions or anything by treating them and then noting down their improvements.

00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:16.860
We have here a saint scientist doctor from England, he is here and he can tell you about it.

00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:22.880
And we are all experimenting with many things. Is he here doctor Wells?

00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:35.900
Alright, you come and see he is now running seven hospitals, London.

00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:57.000
Now we have many doctors here and I think we should meet them who have come from abroad...we should call them.

00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:12.480
aap aaiye( you please come), We have doctor Talwar? ..Dr. Talwar?

00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:16.880
Dr Talwar from Delhi.

00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:28.420
Now we have Dr Ramzad Ali,

00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:35.020
He is from the U.K.

00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:39.700
And he is a great student of medicines actually.

00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:42.880
He has done a lot of studies.

00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:51.500
Then we have Dr Neelam,

00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:55.760
from India.

00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:00.840
Then we have Dr Sarah,

00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:13.820
then we have got a diplomat from UN, Gregoire.

00:52:19.660 --> 00:52:23.660
Then in Russia, we have got Dr Bogdan.

00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:33.660
Today is his Birthday.

00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:49.720
He has sacrificed his job

00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:55.820
in India and he is now here,

00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:01.640
working it out for Russia.

00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:11.600
We hope to see some sense of scientists also for you from America.

00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:18.880
They’ll explain many more things to you,

00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:25.400
also we will send you some papers that they have written.

00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:21.440
And second - is Sahaja Yoga is universal science, which includes Hatha, Raja and other yogas or it is some new principle?

00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:03.500
I should say I was born with this knowledge.

00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:20.500
The second question is about all other yogas.

00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:36.000
Now Hatha yoga is meaning “Ha” and “Tha” meaning the sun and the moon both lines, both energies,

00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:49.340
but in modern times the Hatha yoga they are practising is only of one side,

00:55:57.800 --> 00:56:04.420
moreover the one who started hatha yoga was known as Patanjali,

00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:20.920
so thousands of years back he’s written a book so big as that so thick,

00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:35.700
in that he has written that there are Ashtangas, there are eightfold of yoga, eight aspects, spiritual paths,

00:56:43.620 --> 00:56:49.340
out of that yama niyama is the one which is just a wee bit,

00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:57.300
yama niyama, is control and the laws

00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:15.880
and out of that very wee bit are the exercises,

00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:25.200
now we also use those exercises,

00:57:29.060 --> 00:57:34.960
but later on throughout he has talked about Sahaja yoga,

00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:45.020
first you get thoughtless awareness and then doubtless awareness.

00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:57.760
In those days they used to only have one or two disciples,

00:58:03.380 --> 00:58:07.760
and they cleansed their all centers and then raise their kundalini,

00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:19.900
and it could take years together.

00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:34.980
But now in the Sahaja yoga today,

00:58:38.580 --> 00:58:44.440
I have evolved a method by which first you raise the Kundalini somehow,

00:58:50.540 --> 00:58:57.720
and in that little light, give them little light they see what’s the problem with that

00:59:03.700 --> 00:59:06.060
and just tell them how to correct

00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:12.620
so they can correct their own problems.

00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:20.000
In those days people have no time

00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:27.340
and people are very obstinate also

00:59:29.940 --> 00:59:35.680
so now supposing there’s darkness and you are holding the snake in your hand

00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:49.920
and I say now there is a snake in your hand, you won’t listen to Me, you won’t throw it away till it bites you.

00:59:56.100 --> 00:59:58.280
You will say it’s a rope,

01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:04.360
so the best thing is to put little light,

01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:11.980
so you see the snake and throw it away yourself.

01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:17.760
This is today’s Sahaja yoga

01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:26.800
but it’s the same what he achieved after so many years you can achieve it yourself in a very short time,

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:44.180
and also as we have developed speed I think kundalini has also developed speed.

01:00:49.160 --> 01:01:03.780
We call it this as jet times and the kundalini is also a jet kundalini, we call it as a jet, Jet Times, jet. How do you translate this

01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:24.340
I am myself surprised, it works en masse.

01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:31.840
Yesterday there were 10,000 people,

01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:41.400
and I think 95% of people got realization 95.

01:01:49.960 --> 01:02:04.720
But we do tell you exercises when the kundalini rises, then we tell you if there is any physical problem what exercises to be done, it’s all scientific.

01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:29.440
But this way these days the way people do hath yoga, they just take all the medicine from the medicine box without knowing what is to be taken without discretion.

01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:40.740
Now another is Raja yoga.

01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:54.500
I went down to California and I saw some doctors whom I knew have cut their tongue.

01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:13.840
and they told me that they had to cut it to do a thing called “khechari” to take back the tongue

01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:22.100
to raise the kundalini.

01:03:25.140 --> 01:03:32.100
So now when the kundalini rises it is like the ignition of a car,

01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:48.060
and when the car is ignited all the machinery works by itself, you don’t have to do anything.

01:03:55.020 --> 01:04:02.020
So what they do is to put back the tongue thinking by doing that the kundalini will rise,

01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:19.160
and poor things now can’t speak can’t eat very difficult,

01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:30.720
so it is like moving the wheels without starting the car, will it move?

01:04:37.060 --> 01:04:39.500
It’s all artificial,

01:04:41.380 --> 01:04:43.960
nobody gets realization in that

01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:50.040
because it’s a living process,

01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:56.140
now there’s integral yoga,

01:04:59.420 --> 01:05:01.620
that is all mental.

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:08.160
Talking about yoga how can you get your realization?

01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:18.420
Supposing if you talk to the Mother Earth will she give us flowers?

01:05:25.340 --> 01:05:29.060
Talk..talk..talk..talk..talk..that’s all.

01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:37.980
People get fed up with that talks, books after books like this so many.

01:05:45.260 --> 01:05:48.680
So far I have not written any book for the same reason,

01:05:54.620 --> 01:05:59.300
then we have another one you call that one? It is transcendental meditation,

01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:05.360
that is the worst I tell you

01:06:16.820 --> 01:06:21.800
We had four people from transcendental,

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:33.380
the man was the director of a flying foundation in Scotland,

01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:38.800
to get a mantra

01:06:46.860 --> 01:06:51.740
and the mantras were told in secret

01:06:54.640 --> 01:07:02.040
and the mantras were rare, funny ones “Inga, Pinga, Thinga”,

01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:13.840
it has no meaning, it is not Sanskrit, it has no meaning but it has funny meaning also

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:24.920
Inga means the scorpion’s bite

01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:36.420
and Pinga means when you get possessed you go round and round like that, that is Pinga

01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:47.900
and Thinga means when you show like this to someone,

01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:55.800
300 pounds for that,

01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:05.300
and 6000 pounds for flying halfway.

01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:17.140
What a stupidity, what is the need to fly halfway you already have traffic jams,

01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:37.800
then they were given to drink the water which boiled which boiled potatoes for six days

01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:50.120
then the rings of potato rings,

01:08:56.540 --> 01:09:00.400
and the last day was given the potatoes to eat.

01:09:04.860 --> 01:09:13.760
But this director, his wife, his daughter and a deputy director all got epilepsy,

01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:23.500
so they came here.

01:09:26.620 --> 01:09:31.880
Luckily my husband has gone on a tour so they stayed in my house

01:09:39.700 --> 01:09:42.740
and with my treatment they got cured.

01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:58.200
They had lost all their money, this man was a diamond merchant, he had lost all his money his wife was a granddaughter of a Duke, she has lost everything.

01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:05.500
What is this lady…please tell her to sit down

01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:19.380
and a granddaughter who was the granddaughter of a Duke and this man became bankrupt.

01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:40.460
So and the director and the deputy director became bankrupts

01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:46.860
and he is now gone to South Africa and writing a book.

01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:55.300
The name of the book is “How we were befooled”.

01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:10.140
This t.m. and now they begin Ayurveda.

01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:26.420
They are marketing it now marketing it,

01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:34.840
there is no need for them to market anybody can take to Ayurveda,

01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:50.020
but for Ayurveda, you cannot do it here, you have to go to India because the herbs that are used for curing you cannot grow here.

01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:10.720
So, just that just trying to I don’t know what are they up to, I just don’t know, they can’t bring Ayurveda here.

01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:22.160
India, Indian medicine,

01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:42.440
I mean it is a common sense everybody knows in India that you can’t do Ayurveda anywhere else but in India.

01:12:49.140 --> 01:12:56.140
I think they will now give some sort of this to you in the name of Ayurveda and they will buy it.

01:13:04.140 --> 01:13:09.280
or they give may be some water which has boiled the potatoes.

01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:23.300
One should know all these things. There’s another one who gives diabetes, supposing.

01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:37.600
only to people who are very big cheats in India

01:13:45.380 --> 01:13:49.400
the horrible people who .. they are cheats.

01:13:55.660 --> 01:14:03.640
If he is so good why doesn’t he solves our problem financial problem in India?

01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:09.480
Why doesn’t he solves some  of our financial problem?

01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:18.400
All these people who doing it get heart trouble.

01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:25.680
I am telling you everything frankly,

01:14:28.140 --> 01:14:30.940
they will never talk against each other.

01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:39.300
Christ has said that the house of Satan will never speak against itself.

01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:57.360
But they will speak against Me they do!

01:15:13.100 --> 01:15:15.400
They make like that.

01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:27.320
They may speak against Me and tell you that I must be a dark force or something, they might,

01:15:33.660 --> 01:15:37.400
because it is their business, they will be using money when I am here.

01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:50.400
Alright, Thank you very much.
