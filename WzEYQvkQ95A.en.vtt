00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:10.280
Today we are here to do the Guru's puja

00:00:13.426 --> 00:00:23.786
The Guru is praised more than the Deities and the Gods

00:00:25.072 --> 00:00:32.152
Who is this Guru?

00:00:33.499 --> 00:00:41.037
In this, which is the most important shakti?

00:00:47.403 --> 00:00:54.272
The Guru tattwa is the Shiva.

00:00:54.849 --> 00:01:13.049
The form of the Shiva's power we should consider as the Guru's power.

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:21.650
Because when we take the powers from the Guru's shakti,

00:01:21.816 --> 00:01:30.468
and when the shaktis come within us then we ourselves become the Guru

00:01:31.162 --> 00:01:39.565
And with this, we are blessed for the whole life (Kalyan).

00:01:39.843 --> 00:01:44.508
The one who gets these powers,

00:01:44.643 --> 00:01:50.072
it seems he has got all the blessings (kalyan).

00:01:50.307 --> 00:01:56.543
"Kalyan" is a word which is very hard to explain in a few words.

00:01:57.513 --> 00:02:05.458
"Kalyan" means to get blessed from all the sides.

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.232
the obtain joy from all the sides.

00:02:12.191 --> 00:02:16.191
When someone says that in the blessings you have got the Kalyan,

00:02:16.392 --> 00:02:18.872
what does it mean?

00:02:19.072 --> 00:02:21.509
What is Kalyan?

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:30.710
Kalyan means Atma Sakshatkar, the Self-Realisation.

00:02:31.922 --> 00:02:37.312
Without the Self-Realisation, you cannot have the Kalyan.

00:02:37.513 --> 00:02:44.964
Nobody can understand without having it.

00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:50.479
All these things are in the Kalyan.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:03:00.530
Because of this a person gets all the joy, and he becomes radiant.

00:03:01.411 --> 00:03:10.522
To have this Kalyan, whatever you have to do you have done it all,

00:03:10.723 --> 00:03:14.303
whatever efforts you have to make it has all been made,

00:03:14.504 --> 00:03:18.074
the faith which you have to take, you have already taken it.

00:03:18.275 --> 00:03:21.720
But when you are all in the "Kalyanmarg" (Path of Kalyan),

00:03:21.921 --> 00:03:24.566
when he has given the mantra to have the Kalyan,

00:03:24.767 --> 00:03:27.270
what does it mean?

00:03:27.471 --> 00:03:32.751
It means that the most important thing

00:03:32.952 --> 00:03:36.696
inside you is samadhan (satisfaction).

00:03:36.985 --> 00:03:41.145
Afterwards you all don't have to search for anything,

00:03:41.346 --> 00:03:45.667
you have all become the Gurus.

00:03:45.868 --> 00:03:50.891
You don't have to take some great things in this moment,

00:03:51.092 --> 00:03:53.711
but the blessings of this samadhana

00:03:53.912 --> 00:03:56.698
you all can feel inside yourselves,

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:59.528
you all can know inside yourselves

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:05.512
you all can enjoy within yourselves.

00:04:05.713 --> 00:04:10.675
First of all you all can see that the physical diseases,

00:04:10.876 --> 00:04:21.746
the physical problems can be removed by this Kalyanmarg,

00:04:21.947 --> 00:04:26.418
all the problems which are coming within you

00:04:26.619 --> 00:04:32.712
that prevent you from blossoming,

00:04:34.202 --> 00:04:44.908
can be removed by this Kalyanmarg.

00:04:45.109 --> 00:04:58.082
When you all take to this, you get the Kalyan

00:04:58.283 --> 00:05:08.111
and you have the Self-Realisation.

00:05:09.135 --> 00:05:15.299
In this Shri Mahadeva is helping you.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:21.325
When the kundalini opens the sahasrara,

00:05:21.526 --> 00:05:25.483
Shri Mahadeva is sitting over there.

00:05:25.684 --> 00:05:28.910
And because of this, we call Him Mahadeva.

00:05:29.111 --> 00:05:33.111
It means the God of all the Gods, Mahadeva.

00:05:33.312 --> 00:05:39.025
in this Kalyan there are many important aspects.

00:05:39.226 --> 00:05:44.486
The first thing is shanti (peace).

00:05:44.687 --> 00:05:56.194
Mental peace, physical peace and the peace in the family life.

00:05:56.395 --> 00:06:01.555
In the family life there are many problems, many obstacles,

00:06:02.712 --> 00:06:08.652
and all these can be solved by the Kalyanmarg.

00:06:08.853 --> 00:06:18.951
Afterwards we cannot even feel the presence of the obstacles.

00:06:19.152 --> 00:06:21.870
In this way we could see many people in the whole world

00:06:22.071 --> 00:06:29.301
getting blessings from this Kalyanmarg and meditating upon it

00:06:29.502 --> 00:06:33.302
and enjoying for the whole life.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.437
This is the Kalyan by which mankind

00:06:38.638 --> 00:06:42.071
can get the balances within themselves.

00:06:42.272 --> 00:06:46.134
And to obtain this balance,

00:06:46.335 --> 00:06:50.191
you have to go under the protection of the Guru.

00:06:50.392 --> 00:06:58.557
When you become the devotee of a Guru,

00:06:58.758 --> 00:07:04.172
you get the balance and you get everything.

00:07:04.373 --> 00:07:07.012
After this you do not need anything.

00:07:07.212 --> 00:07:12.581
In this way we get the balance

00:07:12.782 --> 00:07:17.964
and we obtain the power of love within ourselves.

00:07:18.165 --> 00:07:27.020
When mankind obtains this, this whole body rejoices.

00:07:27.221 --> 00:07:34.708
When you obtain this state,

00:07:34.909 --> 00:07:42.989
the shaktis (powers) destroy all the problems,

00:07:43.205 --> 00:07:53.925
the disturbances in the body and the physical state,

00:07:54.596 --> 00:08:04.183
and so many people try very hard to obtain this shakti.

00:08:04.384 --> 00:08:10.245
He can get the shakti only form a person that is self-realised.

00:08:10.446 --> 00:08:18.069
and then he himself becomes in the God's form.

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:19.903
Talk in English

00:08:20.104 --> 00:08:29.465
This is a subject which you can only explain in Hindi language,

00:08:29.666 --> 00:08:38.429
which says that this Guru Padh you get from somebody else.

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:44.710
But that somebody else is itself, is endowed with, the power

00:08:44.911 --> 00:08:50.315
the power of peace of mind, to begin with,

00:08:50.516 --> 00:09:03.761
and also the power to overcome all kinds of of earthly problems,

00:09:03.962 --> 00:09:08.594
mental problems, physical problems.

00:09:08.795 --> 00:09:13.773
All these problems you can solve through your mental balance

00:09:13.974 --> 00:09:21.020
and mental blessings from your Guru.

00:09:21.221 --> 00:09:23.061
When you become the Guru,

00:09:23.262 --> 00:09:29.013
you yourself have the power, to bless others.

00:09:29.222 --> 00:09:39.216
With your blessing power you can create a guru out of many.

00:09:39.758 --> 00:09:49.060
And once the Guru is created and there is a Guru,

00:09:49.261 --> 00:09:54.953
who has this power, it's very satisfying and is very [UNCLEAR: enabling?].

00:09:55.154 --> 00:10:02.394
The satisfaction is so much that you don't want anything.

00:10:02.595 --> 00:10:05.838
This is the power of Shiva.

00:10:06.039 --> 00:10:10.119
You have seen Shiva, doesn't have much clothes,

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.760
He doesn't decorate Himself,

00:10:12.961 --> 00:10:17.186
He is just sitting in meditative mood, all the time.

00:10:17.387 --> 00:10:19.504
He doesn't want anything.

00:10:19.612 --> 00:10:25.091
He's so satisfied with Himself that He doesn't want anything.

00:10:25.292 --> 00:10:31.358
And that is the power you get after the Self-realization,

00:10:31.559 --> 00:10:38.563
if you have a Guru, and Guru of that level and caliber.

00:10:38.764 --> 00:10:41.715
One should not try to become a Guru.

00:10:41.916 --> 00:10:45.549
That's very, impractical.

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:48.437
If you try to become, you'll never.

00:10:48.572 --> 00:10:51.782
It has to come to you automatically,

00:10:51.983 --> 00:10:56.516
without any asking, without any effort.

00:10:56.692 --> 00:11:01.733
So the only way you can get to it is through Dhyana.

00:11:01.934 --> 00:11:04.244
Dhyana is meditation.

00:11:04.302 --> 00:11:06.692
When you meditate,

00:11:06.755 --> 00:11:13.696
just meditate, and meditate, do not ask for anything.

00:11:13.897 --> 00:11:16.692
Meditation itself gives you

00:11:16.893 --> 00:11:25.526
that instrument which can bear this great power of the Guru.

00:11:25.727 --> 00:11:30.612
And then you automatically, you give this power to others;

00:11:30.909 --> 00:11:33.336
you don't have to work it out.

00:11:33.537 --> 00:11:35.661
Just in your presence,

00:11:35.783 --> 00:11:38.470
people can get this power .

00:11:38.572 --> 00:11:42.607
of complete satisfaction

00:11:42.808 --> 00:11:49.532
And there is salvation, for you and for others.

00:11:49.692 --> 00:11:56.522
So all the problems which are faced

00:11:56.577 --> 00:11:59.576
for the journey of ascent are finished

00:11:59.777 --> 00:12:08.535
and you [are or now] drenched in the bliss of heavenly

00:12:08.736 --> 00:12:13.501
peace and joy.

00:12:13.702 --> 00:12:16.641
That's why it is called as Kaivalya,

00:12:16.842 --> 00:12:21.493
means only, only the blessings.

00:12:21.694 --> 00:12:25.342
See that means there is no other word to translate it.

00:12:25.543 --> 00:12:28.739
There's no other way of explaining it.

00:12:28.806 --> 00:12:32.998
It's a state. It's a Stithi.

00:12:33.063 --> 00:12:35.437
It's a state, in that state you have to rise

00:12:35.638 --> 00:12:38.327
and you know that you are in that state.

00:12:38.528 --> 00:12:41.091
It's a very remarkable thing,

00:12:41.292 --> 00:12:46.505
that once you reach that state you don't have to ask for anything.

00:12:46.575 --> 00:12:50.429
It's all there, and you are so satisfied.

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:55.133
I can go on talking about this special power

00:12:55.338 --> 00:13:00.679
but I think whatever I have said please meditate on that.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:04.646
And you are all capable of reaching that state.

00:13:04.847 --> 00:13:08.213
That state of complete peace and joy.

00:13:08.414 --> 00:13:11.593
May God bless you.
