1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,480
So today in the city of Vancouver,

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,080
we have gathered here to pray for

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,240
the country of Canada,

4
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,440
and also for the Canadian people.

5
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,920
Also we have to know that,

6
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,040
there are lots of negative forces working,

7
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,880
and there has to be some

8
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,920
puja to be done to the Mahakali Force.

9
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,960
And so I thought today: ‘Let’s have the puja for Mahakali’.

10
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,920
So Mahakali Puja is the same as you

11
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,320
do the Devi’s Puja,

12
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,920
but first the Mahakali Force came on this Earth.

13
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,320
Adi Shakti came as Mahakali

14
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,800
and created Shri Ganesha.

15
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,960
Then She ascended as Mahasaraswati,

16
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,440
and with that Force She created the whole universe.

17
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,920
In that She created this world,

18
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,440
in a very beautiful manner, with great

19
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,840
arrangements and organizing

20
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,120
and on that were born human beings

21
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,240
because the temperature and all that was made

22
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,840
very congenial for human beings.

23
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,960
So this climate has also

24
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,560
played a big part on the temperament of the people,

25
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,000
on the seeking of the people.

26
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,480
Like in India we can say,

27
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,000
the climate is very congenial for meditation.

28
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,080
It is been a traditional country

29
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,040
from ancient times,

30
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,760
but from the very beginning

31
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,000
we have had seers who were seeking the Truth,

32
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,720
in the jungles.

33
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,400
The reason is this that,

34
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,800
in India its climate is so good

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,640
that you can live in a jungle, no problem.

36
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,000
So it was easy for them to get rid of

37
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,280
all the superficialities of life and

38
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,840
to take seriously – go to the jungles,

39
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,680
dedicate themselves

40
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,240
for finding out the Truth.

41
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,680
And thus they found out the Truth, that it is the Kundalini

42
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,680
which is the Force within us

43
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,840
which gives us Realization.

44
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,800
But this group,

45
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,760
then scattered in different places

46
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,680
and they formed schools,

47
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,160
were called, or universities, called as gotras,

48
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,920
and in these schools were sent children from the age of five years.

49
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,720
Five years they lived with their parents and then

50
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,840
these children were sent there.

51
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,320
And they were given all the education

52
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,440
about day-to-day life.

53
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,640
Their education system was very different.

54
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,720
By their education they made the children

55
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:29,160
very aware about everything, concentration,

56
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,280
and a complete celibacy

57
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,040
because all the people in a gotra could not marry.

58
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,840
Even today supposing I belong to one gotra,

59
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,720
I cannot marry a person in the same gotra.

60
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,800
So it is so much maintained even today.

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,640
Like in the university you cannot marry each other.

62
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,240
So the children were kept like brothers and sisters

63
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,320
and they felt it all the time, brothers and sisters feeling.

64
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,720
In the same way, you see,

65
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,680
it has worked out in many ways

66
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,720
that the Mooladhara chakra was established very strongly in India,

67
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,440
and that’s why,

68
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,880
though we had many other countries like China,

69
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,360
we had old China was there and also Egypt,

70
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,680
then we had Greece and also Rome.

71
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,960
All these countries did not pay much attention

72
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,320
to their Mooladhara chakra

73
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,280
and this Mooladhara was created

74
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,760
by the Mahakali Power.

75
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,720
Mahakali created Shri Ganesha

76
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,400
to emit holiness, auspiciousness, wisdom,

77
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,280
Divine wisdom;

78
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,160
and Her establishment of Shri Ganesha

79
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,200
is also within us on the Mooladhara chakra.

80
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:49,200
But, if we do not pay attention to our Mooladhara chakra,

81
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,600
then our powers become very weak

82
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,960
and we start catching from negativity much more.

83
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:00,520
Those who have good Mooladharas do not catch, so fast.

84
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,640
But we catch, we are harmed more by people

85
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,160
who are negative

86
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,160
because they know that we have bad Mooladharas

87
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,840
and they can affect us.

88
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,600
Now all the gurus and all those false gurus came to

89
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,360
western countries because they knew they can affect much more here,

90
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,080
than in India.

91
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,440
Like Rajneesh, nobody would accept such a man.

92
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,240
Freud, nobody would accept such a person.

93
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,760
But here already Freud has done the

94
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,080
necessary harm to people and they were prepared to become,

95
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,560
vulnerable to these people,

96
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,440
and on that background these people came here

97
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,840
and started

98
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,160
acting and they have been very successful.

99
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,320
All of them

100
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,560
have been found out to be very loose character

101
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,360
and they are being exposed

102
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,120
and it’s nice that whatever is negative,

103
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,600
whatever is false gets exposed.

104
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,080
But still one has to remember that

105
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,120
if we have a strong Mooladhara

106
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,360
then Mahakali Power is the strongest within us,

107
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,320
because as I told you, first She created Shri Ganesha.

108
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,400
So all Her Power are actually expressed in Aumkara

109
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,640
which is Shri Ganesh.

110
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,400
And this Shri Ganesh Power within us represents

111
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,760
the complete love of Mahakali

112
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,320
and all Her Powers of destroying the evil forces.

113
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:37,320
They go hand-in-hand we should say like, every

114
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,000
light has its glory around it, or glow around it.

115
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,360
In the same way the light of Mahakali

116
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,800
has the glow, as chaitanya,

117
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,640
which is actually nothing but Aumkara

118
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,040
and Shri Ganesha.

119
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,440
Now Shri Ganesha has aspects, as I have told them,

120
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:06,600
that if you see the carbon from the left,

121
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,880
you see on the right side Aumkara,

122
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,560
Aum, written like that.

123
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,840
If you see from right to the left,

124
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,520
you see it as swastika.

125
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,040
If you see from down below upward,

126
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,880
then you see it as a cross.

127
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,560
And now they have verified it, they have experimented,

128
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,480
and the scientists have found out

129
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,160
and have now declared that it is so.

130
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,200
So that aspect of Aumkara which is within us is the right side.

131
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,840
But the left side is the swastika.

132
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,720
And the swastika is a very, very

133
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,880
sensitive instrument that if you use it

134
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,520
on the right side then of course

135
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,320
it is all right,

136
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:52,240
it works for construction; but if you use it for left side,

137
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,440
I mean in the anti-clock manner, then it is destructive.

138
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,160
So swastika, when it is moving in its right direction,

139
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,440
clockwise in front and anti-clockwise at the back,

140
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,440
if it is moving in the right direction,

141
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,280
all negativity is thrown out on the periphery,

142
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,120
and absolutely they cannot enter in.

143
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,880
But if it is moved on the left-hand side

144
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,160
then anybody can enter in.

145
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,480
So it is, even if you move a swastika, see now,

146
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,200
create a kind of a opening.

147
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,680
If you make a swastika and see, it opens out.

148
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,640
But if you move it this way, there’s no opening.

149
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,360
It goes on closing, one on another.

150
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,720
So by moving it left side, it starts

151
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:42,200
opening itself to these negative forces.

152
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,960
This is exactly what has happened in the West,

153
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,160
that they had their Mooladhara moving on the left-hand side,

154
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,400
the anti-clockwise. They went against

155
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,440
their own principle of morality,

156
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,640
absolutely against Christ,

157
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,440
and managed to get all these bhoots into themselves.

158
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,600
Now Sahaja Yoga has one problem,

159
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,520
in the West,

160
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,720
that people don’t want to hear that you should be moral.

161
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,440
They find it very difficult.

162
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,760
If you tell them you have to be moral they think we are

163
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,600
fundamentalist or something like that.

164
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,800
But it’s a fundamental thing that we have to be moral people.

165
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,800
Now they are seeing the results of it, that they have got AIDS,

166
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,400
they have got all these diseases, all these troubles.

167
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,680
From that they are learning that our Mooladhara should be

168
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,480
all right, otherwise all these problems can come.

169
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,360
But still they don’t want to accept it,

170
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,600
that they have done mistakes.

171
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,400
So this is another ego problem

172
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,320
that they think: ‘Oh they are very much glorified

173
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,160
and they should be glorified, they did something new’.

174
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,480
I mean if you go and cut your nose,

175
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,520
you don’t glorify such people.

176
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:59,680
But something like that has happened and this,

177
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,920
kind of a nonsense is still stabilized,

178
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,200
and people don’t think much against it.

179
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,080
But the sufferings are so much,

180
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,920
that whatever you may try the sufferings are there,

181
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,360
and they have to accept that they have gone wrong,

182
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,680
and they have done such a wrong thing,

183
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,880
and that’s what they deserve.

184
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,760
But whatever it is, despite all their

185
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,760
- you can say the

186
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,760
foolhardiness or tomfoolery, whatever you may call it,

187
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,440
they are to be saved,

188
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,720
and something has to be done for them because,

189
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,480
after all they are all seekers and they deserve to be

190
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,720
saved.

191
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,320
But with ego they don’t understand their own benevolence.

192
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,360
To them benevolence is that their ego should be satisfied.

193
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,480
So Sahaja Yoga is not like this

194
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,840
that you just put some spirit into somebody

195
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,120
and the person feels absolutely

196
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,720
elated for a time being and then is finished.

197
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,000
But it is something that has to grow,

198
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,800
it’s a living process, it grows within us, it takes time,

199
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,720
and sometimes people get frustrated with it.

200
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,200
But we should not.

201
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,000
We should know we are the foundations

202
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,360
and this is the most important work we are doing

203
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,160
in the history of spirituality. So far,

204
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,240
such work has not been done before.

205
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,400
So, this is such a big thing that we are doing

206
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,000
and we should be very satisfied with ourselves,

207
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,560
and should be confident,

208
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,360
because this requires people of quality.

209
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,120
Not necessarily you should be well-educated,

210
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,800
you should be highly placed.

211
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,040
Though to impress people might be this might help, but still,

212
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:55,320
if you are deep people you can work out, in no time.

213
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,120
If the soil is not good,

214
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,280
then the tree has to go deep down. In the same way,

215
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,040
when the atmosphere is not good,we have to go deep down.

216
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,280
But one should never feel frustrated.

217
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,280
One should never feel upset,

218
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,480
because even if you are one person you are a Saint,

219
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,480
and a Saint brings all the luck,

220
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,480
all the auspiciousness to that country, so

221
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,960
there’s nothing to feel in any way desperate or unhappy about it.

222
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,040
But try to develop your depth by meditation

223
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,280
and by collective sitting down and talking to each other.

224
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,080
I’m sure this will work out

225
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:37,200
and this Force of Mahakali will manifest.

226
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,760
After this puja I am sure something tremendous should happen.

227
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:45,160
As it is you know that all these false gurus have been exposed

228
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,000
and are put on the shelves now, most of them.

229
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,320
Some of them have died, some of them exposed some - has happened.

230
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,080
Gradually they will all disappear. We don’t have to worry about them.

231
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,520
We have to worry about ourselves

232
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,760
that negativity should not fall into us,

233
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,680
and the negativity that falls into Sahaja Yogis

234
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,400
is the frustration.

235
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,200
They feel: ‘We are very few, others are so many,

236
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,480
why should we so few?’ I mean it’s all right.

237
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,320
That has to be that way, doesn’t matter.

238
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,440
And to have more people

239
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,920
is not so important as we should have quality people.

240
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,960
We should have very good quality people who are deep,

241
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,520
who understand Sahaja Yoga, who know it very well,

242
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,760
because even if you have too many

243
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,240
and they don’t know anything about Sahaja Yoga,

244
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,480
they are useless. So not only that you should have this love

245
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,440
of God’s Divine Nature

246
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,120
but also knowledge about Sahaja Yoga.

247
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,320
Both things are the same, actually if you love someone

248
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,600
you know about that person everything.

249
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,800
When such a thing

250
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,040
will happen all over the world that,

251
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,160
so many countries will accept Sahaja Yoga,

252
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,840
and so many will start talking openly about it,

253
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,840
on a very high level,

254
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,280
then even the countries

255
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,880
which have not been able to achieve much results,

256
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,280
or we can say cities, will suddenly jump up.

257
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,520
I have great hopes from Toronto.

258
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,520
Toronto will come up very well I think and I’m sure tonight also,

259
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,280
we’ll have lots of people who will be sticking on.

260
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,040
Because no use having thousand people and ultimately two turn up,

261
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,000
that sort of thing,

262
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,880
common experience.

263
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,720
So this would be a better idea.

264
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,080
And today’s prayer should be, in our hearts,

265
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,720
that let us

266
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:48,640
get very powerful Ganesha Shakti, let us get that.

267
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,200
And second should be that

268
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:55,400
this Shakti should destroy all that is negativity.

269
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,600
Even not to be collective itself is a negativity.

270
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,520
All these collectivity problems,

271
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,640
or all these negativity problems

272
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,200
must be destroyed by this Mahakali Power

273
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,840
which will manifest through us.

274
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,040
May God bless you.
