1
00:00:32,382 --> 00:00:36,799
You all have come now to Bangalore,

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,325
and yesterday you
had gone to Mysore,

3
00:00:42,526 --> 00:00:46,734
which was ruled by Mahishasura.

4
00:00:46,935 --> 00:00:50,967
That’s the reason you didn’t get your
food -

5
00:00:52,813 --> 00:00:55,140
it crossed you.

6
00:00:55,341 --> 00:01:00,696
It’s better not to eat food in such places,
isn’t it?

7
00:01:01,056 --> 00:01:02,545
All right.

8
00:01:02,746 --> 00:01:09,592
So, it’s a very beautiful place
Bangalore is.

9
00:01:09,793 --> 00:01:13,517
Climate is beautiful and you’ll find always

10
00:01:13,718 --> 00:01:19,270
these rakshasas lived in places like this.

11
00:01:19,471 --> 00:01:22,273
Like in Pune, you have, you know this
Rajneesh was there -

12
00:01:22,474 --> 00:01:25,434
here is this Mahishasura still.

13
00:01:25,635 --> 00:01:30,567
They always try to find places which are
cold

14
00:01:30,768 --> 00:01:35,061
because they have so much heat in their
body.

15
00:01:36,593 --> 00:01:44,154
Now as you know, there’s one more rakshasa
here who has to be exposed.

16
00:01:44,577 --> 00:01:50,542
And this, today through our puja, we
should achieve.

17
00:01:57,295 --> 00:02:03,079
In the olden days, when the Goddess had
to fight the rakshasas,

18
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:12,112
the rakshasas were not involved in human
beings as such.

19
00:02:12,313 --> 00:02:16,577
They didn’t become gurus or anything.

20
00:02:16,778 --> 00:02:21,979
And so, now we find in Kali Yuga,

21
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:29,762
they have gone into the brains of sadhakas,
of their devotees.

22
00:02:29,963 --> 00:02:32,988
It’s very difficult to remove them.

23
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:37,564
And once they go into the brain
of the sadhakas,

24
00:02:37,765 --> 00:02:42,130
then sadhakas become, of course, possessed,

25
00:02:42,351 --> 00:02:47,670
they suffer, they have all kinds
of problems.

26
00:02:47,871 --> 00:02:51,722
Despite that, they stick onto that person

27
00:02:51,923 --> 00:02:56,640
because they are mesmerized, very much
mesmerized.

28
00:02:56,841 --> 00:03:03,027
And this mesmerism makes them absolutely
so strong headed

29
00:03:03,228 --> 00:03:08,393
that even if they have to die, they
won’t give up their gurus.

30
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:19,797
The main thing is that in this Kali Yuga
there are so many sadhakas,

31
00:03:19,998 --> 00:03:23,938
they are running helter and skelter.
They are running all over,

32
00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:28,727
trying to find out some way of finding
the truth.

33
00:03:28,928 --> 00:03:34,850
While when the market is on, you know,
you get people to sell it also.

34
00:03:35,051 --> 00:03:37,535
So that’s how so many have come up

35
00:03:37,736 --> 00:03:42,743
and are trying these things, tricks,
on people all over.

36
00:03:42,944 --> 00:03:49,780
Most of them have gone to the Western
countries because people have money.

37
00:03:49,981 --> 00:03:53,536
Thank God we are not so rich in India

38
00:03:53,737 --> 00:03:59,044
that they could not befool us - especially
in America.

39
00:03:59,245 --> 00:04:06,085
And Americans took to these people as
a fish takes to water, very surprisingly.

40
00:04:06,286 --> 00:04:11,822
I went there and told them and warned
them - they wouldn’t listen to me.

41
00:04:12,023 --> 00:04:16,352
They can’t understand anything that you
can get without money.

42
00:04:16,553 --> 00:04:22,956
But despite all that, so many of you have
been able

43
00:04:23,157 --> 00:04:27,118
to come to Sahaja Yoga and get
to the reality.

44
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:34,010
It’s your destiny. It’s blessings to you
of your previous lives

45
00:04:34,211 --> 00:04:38,450
that you could see it so clearly and come
to Sahaja Yoga;

46
00:04:38,651 --> 00:04:43,806
and now you have grown so much, you have
become so matured

47
00:04:44,007 --> 00:04:50,531
and you understand what others are doing
is absolutely wrong.

48
00:04:54,608 --> 00:04:58,949
Also somebody told me about this fellow
Boy John (George) misbehaving

49
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,509
with these homosexuals and all that,

50
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:04,859
and calling them “Hare Rama, Hare
Krishna” - all nonsense.

51
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:10,509
Then I discovered that this story is very
prevalent in Kerala,

52
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:15,377
where they say that Krishna when He became,

53
00:05:15,578 --> 00:05:22,375
I mean Vishnu, when He became Mohini,
He had a child from Shiva. Absurd.

54
00:05:22,576 --> 00:05:25,015
And now, Murti is telling me when I told
you this story,

55
00:05:25,216 --> 00:05:29,697
you said, “This is blasphemy, this is sin.”
Same way I feel.

56
00:05:29,898 --> 00:05:33,959
It’s very dangerous also to play about
with a person like Vishnu.

57
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,099
He is a very dangerous deity.

58
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:42,566
Shiva, ultimately, is very dangerous but
it takes time with Him.

59
00:05:42,767 --> 00:05:46,671
But as far as Vishnu is concerned, one has
to be very careful,

60
00:05:46,872 --> 00:05:50,692
misbehaving like this. I don’t know
what is going to happen to them.

61
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:56,223
But they are so stupid, they are so stupid.

62
00:05:56,424 --> 00:06:03,332
One thing they should judge that if this
thing you are doing is good for them,

63
00:06:03,543 --> 00:06:09,217
is by God’s blessings, then why should you
get diseases?

64
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:15,234
There is a regular one crore of people,
going to a nonsensical place

65
00:06:15,435 --> 00:06:18,316
where they have this Ayappa business,

66
00:06:18,517 --> 00:06:22,760
and they wear black dresses for one month,

67
00:06:22,961 --> 00:06:26,913
and they have their beard and everything.

68
00:06:27,114 --> 00:06:32,966
They starve themselves, they go up, miles
together they climb,

69
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:38,179
do all kinds of things that is a sort
of a suffering for one month.

70
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:45,235
And eleven months they do everything.
This kind of a nonsense, you see.

71
00:06:45,436 --> 00:06:51,290
So now it has become like a craze like
jogging or something like that in Kerala.

72
00:06:51,491 --> 00:06:56,740
And this year there were one crore
of people doing this stupid nonsense.

73
00:06:56,941 --> 00:07:01,133
I mean, even in India we have such stupid
people, you can see that.

74
00:07:01,334 --> 00:07:07,549
But the number is not so much, I must say,
as it is in America, percentage.

75
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:12,182
In India, we are very conditioned
by this ritualism,

76
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:15,502
especially in the South we have lots
of ritualistic things.

77
00:07:15,703 --> 00:07:19,771
And we are impressed by people if you take
out some watches,

78
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:23,052
Swiss made watches, or things like that.

79
00:07:23,253 --> 00:07:26,301
To them, it’s something really remarkable
that how can you have

80
00:07:26,502 --> 00:07:32,539
Swiss made watches here. Very simple
people.

81
00:07:32,921 --> 00:07:41,379
They do not understand that none
of the incarnations did these tricks

82
00:07:41,867 --> 00:07:51,142
and that truth should be based on
the tradition, on the shastras.

83
00:07:51,343 --> 00:07:56,441
It cannot deviate and whatever deviates

84
00:07:56,642 --> 00:08:03,905
is actually heretic and also is blasphemy.

85
00:08:04,107 --> 00:08:10,742
But as I told you the other day that those
people who talk of knowledge, like Sufis,

86
00:08:10,943 --> 00:08:16,296
who got their realisation, real Sufis, they
were called as heretics -

87
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:21,984
they were thrown out of the religion.
Also the Christians -

88
00:08:22,185 --> 00:08:28,725
the early Christians, who were Gnostics -
were called as mad people, heretics.

89
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:32,760
In the same way, those who are following
stupid things,

90
00:08:32,961 --> 00:08:39,147
and are following something that is very
black and dark, negative,

91
00:08:39,348 --> 00:08:43,024
will definitely go against Sahaja Yoga

92
00:08:43,225 --> 00:08:51,556
and will say that this is something heretic
or it is something that is blasphemy.

93
00:08:52,074 --> 00:08:55,849
But, as you understand now what it is,

94
00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:01,444
we have to bring forth new laws that those
who are not Sahaja Yogis

95
00:09:01,645 --> 00:09:05,177
are actually, if they are practicing any
religion,

96
00:09:05,385 --> 00:09:09,561
they are not doing the right thing.

97
00:09:09,762 --> 00:09:13,370
Slowly slowly, as Vatican is getting
exposed

98
00:09:13,571 --> 00:09:16,327
and the Christian churches are getting
exposed,

99
00:09:16,528 --> 00:09:20,901
even in India, so many such organisations
are getting exposed,

100
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:25,924
and people are understanding that this is
very wrong.

101
00:09:27,452 --> 00:09:38,314
These ideas actually have come from
incarnations only,

102
00:09:38,515 --> 00:09:44,038
like Adi Shankaracharya himself has said,
“Tatatkim, tatatkim, tatatkim” -

103
00:09:44,239 --> 00:09:47,010
if you have not followed your guru,
then “tatatkim”.

104
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,664
So they said now any guru can come
from the jail,

105
00:09:51,865 --> 00:09:58,355
can be a smuggler, can be anything,
characterless person -

106
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:02,611
if you call him a guru, then he is a guru.

107
00:10:03,017 --> 00:10:09,170
Whatever we call somebody, say we call
somebody as a guru

108
00:10:09,683 --> 00:10:13,083
and we stick on, “This is my guru.”

109
00:10:13,284 --> 00:10:18,238
But what did the guru give to you, that
nobody asks.

110
00:10:18,439 --> 00:10:21,426
We just feel happy, “Oh, very nice.”

111
00:10:21,627 --> 00:10:26,724
It’s like the worms clinging onto the lotus
and saying, “Oh, we have lotus.”

112
00:10:26,925 --> 00:10:31,478
What about you, you are a worm still,
what is the use of these lotuses?

113
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:36,273
Or whether that is lotus or a snake, God
only knows.

114
00:10:36,474 --> 00:10:42,869
So a guru who doesn’t talk of realisation,
who doesn’t talk of Kundalini,

115
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:48,272
who doesn’t talk of ascent, who doesn’t
talk of second birth -

116
00:10:48,473 --> 00:10:52,976
cannot be a guru - minimum of minimum.

117
00:10:53,872 --> 00:11:00,107
So like we also believe in say Rama,
“I believe in Rama.” So what?

118
00:11:00,308 --> 00:11:04,292
Are you obliging Rama or Rama is obliging
you?

119
00:11:04,493 --> 00:11:07,889
“I believe in Christ” - so what?

120
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:10,527
You believe in this, you believe in that -

121
00:11:10,728 --> 00:11:13,724
it’s such an absurd idea, still I never
understand

122
00:11:13,925 --> 00:11:17,518
when people say, “I believe in this.”

123
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:21,233
But what does that mean, what does that
mean?

124
00:11:21,434 --> 00:11:24,035
You believe in Christ.

125
00:11:24,236 --> 00:11:27,041
You are leading a licentious life, you are
doing all kinds -

126
00:11:27,242 --> 00:11:34,132
but “I believe in Christ, I believe
in God.”

127
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:39,412
Doing everything against divinity, and
“I believe”.

128
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:43,894
So the question comes: what do you mean
by believing?

129
00:11:44,095 --> 00:11:49,666
It’s like, “I believe, it is silver” -
so what? It is silver.

130
00:11:49,867 --> 00:11:53,623
What does it make to you to believe by that
saying something

131
00:11:53,824 --> 00:11:59,039
you have done great? What is great in that?

132
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,936
Now if you say, “I believe in
Shri Mataji” - so what?

133
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:10,588
All right, you believe in me because
of certain experiences - still what?

134
00:12:12,056 --> 00:12:18,924
Mataji should be in your life, should be
in your expression,

135
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:24,733
in your behaviour, in your treatment
to others,

136
00:12:24,934 --> 00:12:29,231
in understanding each other, and loving
each other.

137
00:12:29,432 --> 00:12:32,298
That is what impresses people.

138
00:12:32,499 --> 00:12:35,446
People say, “All right, we’ll come to
Mataji, we’ll just pray to Her

139
00:12:35,647 --> 00:12:39,200
and go away - we’ll not talk to you.” Why?

140
00:12:39,401 --> 00:12:43,377
“Because we believe in Mataji, finished.”

141
00:12:45,277 --> 00:12:47,998
So now we have to understand that you
believe in Sahaja Yoga,

142
00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:52,810
of course, it is Shraddha (faith), it is
not a blind faith, I agreed,

143
00:12:53,011 --> 00:12:57,221
but still belief has to penetrate into your
being.

144
00:12:57,422 --> 00:13:01,819
This belief has to act, has to show
results,

145
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:07,805
it has to work out in every way.

146
00:13:08,483 --> 00:13:12,327
Somebody might say that we believe
in Mataji and She does everything -

147
00:13:12,528 --> 00:13:14,889
She’ll do bhakti for us.

148
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:19,850
I should sit down and sing the song
of Mataji or what.

149
00:13:21,063 --> 00:13:27,390
So what is going to come from your side,
that is what we have to understand;

150
00:13:27,591 --> 00:13:30,929
and once that starts working, then these
demons

151
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:35,583
and these rakshasas will all vanish,
no problem.

152
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:40,106
So: “What am I doing for Sahaja Yoga?”

153
00:13:40,307 --> 00:13:43,916
We should ask the question, “What am I
doing?”

154
00:13:44,117 --> 00:13:50,007
Now if you make this instrument, and then
if it is not doing anything,

155
00:13:50,215 --> 00:13:53,983
what is the use of making the instrument?

156
00:13:58,617 --> 00:14:03,237
Now you are the light, you have got
enlightenment:

157
00:14:03,702 --> 00:14:06,642
but what is the use of a light which is
hanging somewhere,

158
00:14:06,843 --> 00:14:10,344
which is not giving light to anyone?

159
00:14:12,194 --> 00:14:18,585
So when you are giving light to others,
in a very innocent manner,

160
00:14:18,786 --> 00:14:23,995
in a very reciprocal manner - not this way
that we are giving light

161
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:27,283
because we want to have an advantage
over it,

162
00:14:27,484 --> 00:14:32,481
or we want to show off or any all
nonsensical things that are there.

163
00:14:32,682 --> 00:14:34,731
Then the derailment starts.

164
00:14:34,932 --> 00:14:39,170
People start saying, “Oh, I am this,
I am that.”

165
00:14:39,901 --> 00:14:47,135
But with full understanding, that we are
instruments in the hands of the divinity

166
00:14:47,336 --> 00:14:54,043
and we are just enjoying that divinity
flowing through us and working out,

167
00:14:54,244 --> 00:14:56,681
you won’t feel tired, you won’t feel
upset,

168
00:14:56,882 --> 00:15:01,839
you’ll not be in any way in trouble.

169
00:15:02,393 --> 00:15:05,900
But this has happened with you.

170
00:15:06,211 --> 00:15:11,939
You are so matured, but still, we all have
to decide

171
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:17,163
that now we are going to India to get
ourselves the whole joy of the tour.

172
00:15:17,364 --> 00:15:20,185
But for what?

173
00:15:21,657 --> 00:15:26,198
Not to keep to yourself, but to share it
with others.

174
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:31,201
This joy is for you to share it with
others.

175
00:15:31,402 --> 00:15:37,148
Unless and until you learn that, your ego
will come back again and again.

176
00:15:37,349 --> 00:15:42,177
And also you have seen the way

177
00:15:42,378 --> 00:15:48,652
people who have been even spreading Sahaja
Yoga got into the mess of ego.

178
00:15:48,853 --> 00:15:54,404
So one has to be very careful. The more
you are rising in your divinity,

179
00:15:54,605 --> 00:15:59,394
the more you are maturing, you have
to be very careful.

180
00:15:59,595 --> 00:16:06,782
See on a tree if you see, if there’s
a leaf, no insect will enter.

181
00:16:06,983 --> 00:16:12,570
If there’s a flower, the insect will come
and it will make it into a fruit.

182
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:18,851
But when it is a fruit, then the insect
will enter and eat it off.

183
00:16:19,052 --> 00:16:22,244
So when you are becoming a fruit, you have
to be very careful

184
00:16:22,445 --> 00:16:25,438
that no insect should get into you.

185
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:31,864
On the contrary, now you have [the]
capacity to destroy all the insects.

186
00:16:32,072 --> 00:16:40,097
And that is what is, I would say, is
the state where we should all come up to.

187
00:16:40,298 --> 00:16:42,531
So you are destroying insects on one side

188
00:16:42,732 --> 00:16:46,919
and satisfying people on the other side.

189
00:16:47,267 --> 00:16:53,641
Collectivity is, of course no doubt, is
the only way you can be cleansed;

190
00:16:53,842 --> 00:16:57,328
but the greater thing is to go out,
all out, to find out,

191
00:16:57,529 --> 00:17:00,569
“Where can I spread Sahaja Yoga?
Where can I go?

192
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:04,812
What is the nearest village I can go?
Where will I work it out?”

193
00:17:05,013 --> 00:17:08,368
All those things the more you think,
the better it is,

194
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:13,035
and you start moving in that direction.

195
00:17:13,236 --> 00:17:15,784
Once you start moving in that direction,
you will be surprised

196
00:17:15,985 --> 00:17:18,938
Sahaja Yoga will move ahead of you.

197
00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:21,898
You’ll meet the people whom you want,

198
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:27,194
you’ll get all the necessary help that
you want,

199
00:17:27,395 --> 00:17:30,406
suddenly you’ll find some people who will
come down

200
00:17:30,607 --> 00:17:34,832
and say, “Now, what can we do for you?”

201
00:17:35,033 --> 00:17:40,520
Every type of help starts coming to you
the way you expand yourself.

202
00:17:40,721 --> 00:17:46,220
It’s like the expanding your wings, like
a bird does,

203
00:17:46,421 --> 00:17:53,291
and then you take off. But if you don’t
extend yourself,

204
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:59,530
you keep Sahaja Yoga to yourself only,
it doesn’t work.

205
00:18:00,904 --> 00:18:04,961
I know you love me very much and you know
I love you very much,

206
00:18:05,162 --> 00:18:11,110
but don’t you think others should also
share this love,

207
00:18:11,311 --> 00:18:14,821
others should also have this?

208
00:18:15,022 --> 00:18:19,760
Now when we start struggling, we also
struggle with people

209
00:18:19,961 --> 00:18:24,968
who are very difficult - like “my brother,
my brother’s son...”

210
00:18:25,169 --> 00:18:31,213
Just don’t go near my, get away.
My is the most difficult thing.

211
00:18:31,414 --> 00:18:35,877
You see, in my family, I don’t touch them

212
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,838
because once you go to my they sit
on your heads,

213
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:44,608
or maybe they’ll sit on the heads of the
Sahaja Yogis or something, nothing.

214
00:18:44,809 --> 00:18:47,451
So don’t go to the people – “it is
my sister,

215
00:18:47,652 --> 00:18:50,709
she is my sister-in-law”, nothing
of the kind.

216
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:56,500
What you have to do is to see what is
beyond

217
00:18:56,701 --> 00:19:01,080
and the more you’ll go beyond, the better
it will be.

218
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,653
See, you can see clearly, we’ve worked
so hard in Maharashtra,

219
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:11,325
it is a useless place I find. Maharashtrian
Sahaja Yogis are few, very few,

220
00:19:11,526 --> 00:19:14,947
but whatever are there are also not
so good.

221
00:19:15,148 --> 00:19:18,959
While Delhi Sahaja Yogis, now here
in Madras, in Bangalore,

222
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:23,339
see what nice Sahaja Yogis are there.

223
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:28,098
So much work I have done there.

224
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:34,529
So those who are very near to you, always
cannot see the greatness of you.

225
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:40,201
Like if you go near the big mountain, you
cannot see the big mountain,

226
00:19:40,402 --> 00:19:43,395
you have to be away and then you see.
In the same way,

227
00:19:43,596 --> 00:19:46,559
when you want to do some work with anyone,

228
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:50,002
try to see that you are not closely
related,

229
00:19:50,203 --> 00:19:54,776
nor do you have any connections with them.
Something unknown.

230
00:19:54,977 --> 00:19:58,207
These people are much better for you
to follow

231
00:19:58,408 --> 00:20:03,509
and they will keep your attention tight,
absolutely on you.

232
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:08,766
Otherwise, the people who are known
to you will trouble you.

233
00:20:08,967 --> 00:20:12,050
Now there are many difficulties in
spreading Sahaja Yoga -

234
00:20:12,251 --> 00:20:18,094
there were many, many more before, slowly
these are coming down.

235
00:20:18,295 --> 00:20:22,464
Naturally, it is much better than at
the time of Thomas [the Apostle]

236
00:20:22,665 --> 00:20:26,690
because he had to hide his treatise
to save it from others.

237
00:20:26,891 --> 00:20:30,070
He thought a day will come when there
will be resurrection time,

238
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:33,931
then this treatise would be [revealed].
Imagine, only 48 years back,

239
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:39,507
now it would be around 53 or 50 years
back, it was discovered.

240
00:20:41,051 --> 00:20:46,305
It was not discovered before. He had
to hide it.

241
00:20:46,506 --> 00:20:48,899
But now we are not to hide.

242
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:54,250
We are to go all out and must know,
must forgive.

243
00:20:54,451 --> 00:20:59,411
That, you see, ours is an open place where
anybody can come in.

244
00:20:59,612 --> 00:21:02,073
So we get all kinds of people - if you go
and meet people,

245
00:21:02,274 --> 00:21:07,893
also there is all kinds of oppositions,
all these things, doesn’t matter.

246
00:21:08,094 --> 00:21:12,477
Everything can be overcome, but first is
your own initiative

247
00:21:12,678 --> 00:21:17,238
and your own lethargy which has to be
overcome.

248
00:21:19,852 --> 00:21:22,004
Then it will start spreading out.

249
00:21:22,205 --> 00:21:25,140
Of course, we have already lot of Sahaja
Yogis -

250
00:21:25,341 --> 00:21:29,243
in Russia, if you see, we have so many,
in thousands.

251
00:21:29,444 --> 00:21:33,602
But in every place we can have lots
of people now

252
00:21:33,803 --> 00:21:38,096
and I’m sure this is a nice year where they
say so, predict

253
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:41,317
that Sahaja Yoga will grow very much
this year.

254
00:21:41,518 --> 00:21:44,530
So this is the beginning we are starting
today.

255
00:21:44,731 --> 00:21:47,706
I just wanted to tell you that you have
the power,

256
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:51,680
you have the shakti within your reach.

257
00:21:51,881 --> 00:21:57,254
They said it was very cold one day before
I came here,

258
00:21:57,455 --> 00:22:00,797
I said, “Don’t worry.” I didn’t give
bandhan or anything.

259
00:22:00,998 --> 00:22:06,544
I just came here and how they know!

260
00:22:06,745 --> 00:22:10,943
It’s become all right, you are sitting
in your kurta pyjamas.

261
00:22:11,144 --> 00:22:16,392
Otherwise, you would have been in your
three-piece suits shivering.

262
00:22:16,593 --> 00:22:22,169
That’s how it works. But you have to be
that way dedicated.

263
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:26,773
Now for all these: Surya [sun] and Chandra
[moon]

264
00:22:26,974 --> 00:22:33,849
and all these stars and the whole cosmos
has only one thing to do -

265
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:40,211
is to see that Sahaja Yoga is spreading
well,

266
00:22:40,412 --> 00:22:45,627
is settling well and is achieving its goal.

267
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:50,548
Every element is working it out.

268
00:22:50,749 --> 00:22:55,519
Everything is working - this Paramchaitanya
is working around in so many ways.

269
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,149
You are not to be convinced about me,
I know.

270
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,187
But now you have to be convinced
about yourself

271
00:23:00,405 --> 00:23:04,050
that you have all the powers within you.

272
00:23:04,251 --> 00:23:07,424
I mean, I don’t do anything really, to be
very frank.

273
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:12,190
If I could do everything, I would not have
had you, I would have done it myself.

274
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:15,584
But you have to do it - you are my
channels.

275
00:23:15,785 --> 00:23:21,054
You are the channels of Shakti. But do it
in a way which is gracious,

276
00:23:21,255 --> 00:23:25,005
which is beautiful, which is very
satisfying.

277
00:23:25,206 --> 00:23:30,773
Like yesterday, that musician - he just
wanted to entertain you.

278
00:23:30,974 --> 00:23:36,970
He wanted to play. I mean, he was
enjoying it.

279
00:23:37,171 --> 00:23:43,414
In the same way, we should want to do it.
I don’t have to tell you.

280
00:23:43,615 --> 00:23:48,841
And I am sure, in every area that you work,

281
00:23:49,042 --> 00:23:53,176
in every personality whom you meet,

282
00:23:53,377 --> 00:23:56,850
you can start talking about Sahaja Yoga
and tell them.

283
00:23:57,051 --> 00:24:00,440
It works. It acts.

284
00:24:00,641 --> 00:24:05,755
Moreover, it is behind you the whole power
of all the deities,

285
00:24:05,956 --> 00:24:10,004
and in front is Sahaja Yoga running
forward fast, this Paramchaitanya:

286
00:24:10,205 --> 00:24:12,496
“Now the Sahaja Yogis are coming,
all right,

287
00:24:12,697 --> 00:24:18,383
let them not eat their food, finished” -
organising.

288
00:24:18,637 --> 00:24:22,561
Everything so beautifully done. Now
see the arrangements and all -

289
00:24:22,776 --> 00:24:28,261
I mean, I was thinking such few people
here, and about 20 Sahaja Yogis in Madras -

290
00:24:28,462 --> 00:24:32,690
can you believe it, all this arrangement?

291
00:24:33,479 --> 00:24:41,217
How it’s working out, how it is giving
results, it’s really remarkable.

292
00:24:42,265 --> 00:24:47,189
So have faith in yourself, have faith
in all of them helping you,

293
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:50,609
not to be nervous and just go ahead.

294
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:55,415
Because the shakti is in you. You have
the power.

295
00:24:55,616 --> 00:24:59,644
Every kind of power you have, I assure
you, you have every power.

296
00:24:59,815 --> 00:25:01,844
Ask for it and you’ll
have it.

297
00:25:02,045 --> 00:25:04,577
Whatever you ask for it, it will happen.

298
00:25:04,778 --> 00:25:12,044
But don’t hesitate. As I said the other
day, that I make you sit on the throne,

299
00:25:12,245 --> 00:25:16,090
then also I put the crown on your head.

300
00:25:16,291 --> 00:25:23,222
And also I say, “Now you are the king,”
but still you are running away

301
00:25:23,423 --> 00:25:26,692
and not believing me - looking this side
with fear –

302
00:25:26,893 --> 00:25:30,043
“Am I a king really? How can I be?”

303
00:25:30,244 --> 00:25:34,417
That’s not the way. Have faith in yourself.

304
00:25:34,618 --> 00:25:38,564
I am very happy you all have come here.

305
00:25:38,765 --> 00:25:42,239
We are trying to do whatever is possible

306
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:48,972
to make you comfortable and for you
to provide whatever is necessary.

307
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:53,806
Of course, you are only just Spirits

308
00:25:54,007 --> 00:25:58,222
and you try to find the comfort of your
Spirit.

309
00:25:58,423 --> 00:26:03,417
I know that you are very adjusting
yourself.

310
00:26:03,872 --> 00:26:07,096
Everybody is surprised how you people
from the West -

311
00:26:07,297 --> 00:26:13,358
who just believe in materialism - can take
to Sahaja Yoga: they are quite surprised.

312
00:26:14,807 --> 00:26:20,516
But you are all very sweet people,

313
00:26:20,717 --> 00:26:27,469
I think, something very special who have
come to Sahaja Yoga.

314
00:26:28,749 --> 00:26:34,319
And by God’s grace, I’m sure

315
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:38,943
you will be the people who will be
the foundation of Sahaja Yoga

316
00:26:39,144 --> 00:26:49,612
and you will build the great mansion
of Sahaja Yoga

317
00:26:49,977 --> 00:26:58,269
with your wisdom, faith, shakti and love.

318
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:04,620
Today we’ll worship the Shakti - it’s very
much needed -

319
00:27:04,821 --> 00:27:10,050
the Shakti who destroyed all the devils,
all the rakshasas.

320
00:27:10,251 --> 00:27:16,518
That is what we are going to worship
today - the shakti within you and without.

321
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:19,786
It’s your desire which is going to work.

322
00:27:19,987 --> 00:27:25,247
So today we are going to worship
the Shakti itself - Mahakali.

323
00:27:25,448 --> 00:27:28,550
May God bless you.

324
00:27:41,811 --> 00:27:45,785
So, today first we’ll have the washing
of Feet

325
00:27:46,043 --> 00:27:49,743
and with that we’ll have (Hindi)

326
00:27:53,807 --> 00:27:57,360
one Atharva Shirsha we’ll do

327
00:27:57,561 --> 00:28:02,120
and then we can have thousand names,

328
00:28:05,288 --> 00:28:14,872
which are made very easily compiled
together

329
00:28:15,094 --> 00:28:18,389
by the Noida people, which you can sing.

330
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:22,799
That’s how we can worship the Shakti.
