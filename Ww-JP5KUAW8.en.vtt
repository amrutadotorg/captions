00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.325
Today we have gathered here

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:10.534
to do the Devi Puja.

00:04:14.742 --> 00:04:20.450
This Puja was performed many a times

00:04:21.784 --> 00:04:28.325
and the Devi was requested

00:04:31.117 --> 00:04:33.826
by the Devas to save them

00:04:36.283 --> 00:04:43.367
from the  tyranny of devilish people.

00:04:46.784 --> 00:04:51.784
Today I feel the same way,

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:57.408
that we are now in the grip

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:04.617
of a funny situation; that

00:05:06.242 --> 00:05:13.325
there are people who are themselves devils, I think,

00:05:14.826 --> 00:05:19.200
--  and also (people who are) mesmerised by them --

00:05:21.492 --> 00:05:28.325
who are trying to do something which they should never have done.

00:05:34.325 --> 00:05:39.117
But they don't know that

00:05:41.617 --> 00:05:44.700
there is a climax of everything.

00:05:45.784 --> 00:05:48.659
And that point has arrived

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:54.700
where all the good people,

00:05:55.826 --> 00:06:01.242
especially the Sahaja Yogis should put all their mind

00:06:01.742 --> 00:06:07.450
to the destruction of these horrible

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.659
personalities like Mahishasura.

00:06:13.826 --> 00:06:21.325
In those days, it was very simple

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:26.617
because devils came as devils

00:06:27.784 --> 00:06:32.575
and you could see them, that they are devils,

00:06:33.575 --> 00:06:39.242
and all their behaviour proved that they were devils.

00:06:40.283 --> 00:06:44.450
Why they did it?  Why were they cruel?

00:06:45.325 --> 00:06:51.200
Because so called 'human beings' as they are

00:06:52.325 --> 00:06:57.325
-- they are not -- they are by nature devilish

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:03.534
and they want to do something by which they can destroy

00:07:04.242 --> 00:07:07.158
human beings, and good human beings.

00:07:11.575 --> 00:07:18.408
It is evident that the time has come

00:07:19.492 --> 00:07:22.367
for them to be destroyed.

00:07:26.784 --> 00:07:31.617
In no way I could be against Islam

00:07:32.742 --> 00:07:36.367
and ever to criticise Mohammed Saab.

00:07:38.325 --> 00:07:43.325
He was divine, no doubt, and tried to do divine work.

00:07:44.492 --> 00:07:50.158
But out of that divine work these stupid people have come up

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:56.492
who accept those devilish people.

00:07:59.367 --> 00:08:06.283
You will be amazed to know that in Islam

00:08:07.534 --> 00:08:12.450
there are seventy-four groups!

00:08:15.784 --> 00:08:21.242
They say "We follow one religion" -- but they do not.

00:08:24.492 --> 00:08:26.784
Out of these,

00:08:28.659 --> 00:08:32.700
some of them are really evil people,

00:08:36.158 --> 00:08:39.200
and they call themselves

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:44.117
by the name as Devbandhis because this is a place in India,

00:08:45.826 --> 00:08:48.450
and also they are called as Wahabees.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:55.158
I have been knowing them since long

00:08:57.283 --> 00:09:01.242
because in our household, in my father's household,

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:06.659
we had lots of Muslim people working as cooks,

00:09:07.283 --> 00:09:12.283
as drivers, as other servants.

00:09:13.492 --> 00:09:17.200
And these Wahabees are very interesting people

00:09:17.784 --> 00:09:21.575
because they don't believe even in Mohammed Saab.

00:09:22.826 --> 00:09:24.492
So if you tell them

00:09:24.742 --> 00:09:27.575
that Mohammed Saab has said such-and-such a thing,

00:09:27.826 --> 00:09:30.283
they say "No, we don't believe in Mohammed Saab".

00:09:30.534 --> 00:09:34.492
"So, in whom do you believe?"  "We believe in Allah!"

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.242
"Have you met Allah?  Have you seen him,

00:09:38.742 --> 00:09:40.784
that you are believing in Him?"

00:09:41.617 --> 00:09:45.492
But in their whole behaviour

00:09:46.408 --> 00:09:50.283
it was cruelty which was innately built,

00:09:51.742 --> 00:09:57.492
very cruel; and whenever my father saw that,

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.742
he asked them to get out.

00:10:01.742 --> 00:10:06.450
Because (they) always had sinister

00:10:07.742 --> 00:10:13.158
practices by which they used to treat others.

00:10:15.575 --> 00:10:19.784
I never knew that it will come up to that stage.

00:10:21.575 --> 00:10:25.325
And they are mostly they were from Afghanistan,

00:10:25.492 --> 00:10:29.283
can you imagine, mostly.

00:10:29.534 --> 00:10:33.742
Of course they tortured other Afghanis also;

00:10:34.617 --> 00:10:37.242
and where-ever they went

00:10:38.242 --> 00:10:42.700
they had a speciality that they could be very cruel.

00:10:45.158 --> 00:10:50.242
Not all Afghanis, no, not at all, but some of them.

00:10:51.158 --> 00:10:55.158
And they came to India from Afghanistan

00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:00.158
and we have different types of Afghanis.

00:11:01.117 --> 00:11:07.575
Some were very loving, kind, helpful, very nice people.

00:11:09.242 --> 00:11:11.784
And some of them were very cruel.

00:11:13.408 --> 00:11:15.700
First we didn't understand what is this.

00:11:17.117 --> 00:11:21.367
But because my father was a scholar and scholar of Islam,

00:11:22.575 --> 00:11:30.492
he told us "These are not Islamic. They call themselves Wahabees

00:11:32.117 --> 00:11:37.826
and they are not Islamic".  I can see that today, so clearly.

00:11:41.826 --> 00:11:45.367
Not that in other

00:11:47.826 --> 00:11:52.826
religions or in other groups there are not bad people.

00:11:54.492 --> 00:11:59.408
But these Wahabees were

00:11:59.659 --> 00:12:03.742
secretly working out different groups.

00:12:05.283 --> 00:12:11.408
They are not many.  And that's what my father had told me

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:16.158
"One day they will become very explosive

00:12:17.492 --> 00:12:22.784
and they might try to completely ruin the world".

00:12:24.242 --> 00:12:26.283
At first I couldn't understand,

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:30.492
because, after all, they looked like human beings only.

00:12:32.283 --> 00:12:35.617
But he says, he told me,

00:12:36.283 --> 00:12:39.325
"They are absolutely camouflaged,

00:12:41.784 --> 00:12:45.325
and once they start their cruelty

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:48.659
you will not know what to do."

00:12:50.367 --> 00:12:53.617
We had one invader in our country

00:12:54.659 --> 00:12:57.158
called as Mohammed Shah Dali

00:12:58.617 --> 00:13:01.700
He was a very, very cruel man, very cruel,

00:13:03.617 --> 00:13:06.408
and he used to even kill the Muslims

00:13:07.242 --> 00:13:11.117
because his concept was

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:15.367
that you should not worship Mohammed Saab

00:13:17.367 --> 00:13:23.408
because Mohammed Saab said that "I am not Divine".

00:13:23.826 --> 00:13:28.450
I also used to say the same, to save from the stupid people.

00:13:29.158 --> 00:13:31.742
For years I used to say "I am not Divine",

00:13:32.492 --> 00:13:37.784
but when they felt My vibrations and all that, they believed.

00:13:38.826 --> 00:13:42.242
But those who believed in Mohammed Saab

00:13:43.742 --> 00:13:46.408
were never understood by these people.

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:50.617
Very, very cruel,

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:54.784
and because they don't even believe in Mohammed Saab

00:13:55.742 --> 00:14:00.742
you cannot argue with them on any point; you cannot argue with them

00:14:01.534 --> 00:14:04.158
what is written in the Koran

00:14:04.575 --> 00:14:06.450
because you don't believe in Koran,

00:14:06.617 --> 00:14:09.700
you don't believe in Mohammed Saab you believe in Allah.

00:14:10.367 --> 00:14:13.617
God knows from where do they have connections!

00:14:15.367 --> 00:14:18.659
But gradually it was surprising that

00:14:19.617 --> 00:14:22.534
they could mesmerise --as we have

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:27.325
horrible gurus who come as gurus and they mesmerise.

00:14:28.826 --> 00:14:32.700
You have seen them, people being mesmerised.

00:14:33.492 --> 00:14:37.450
So many are being exposed and so many are going to be exposed.

00:14:38.784 --> 00:14:43.450
But mostly they were people

00:14:43.826 --> 00:14:46.450
who were interested in money,

00:14:46.826 --> 00:14:52.659
in getting lots of money, somehow, in the name of religion.

00:14:55.826 --> 00:15:01.784
But at that time, people didn't see their cruel methods

00:15:02.325 --> 00:15:04.575
and their cruelties.

00:15:05.575 --> 00:15:09.700
This cruelty started growing

00:15:10.534 --> 00:15:14.492
and you know we have been to Nizamudhin aulia.

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:20.450
In that place only I discovered there's a Madharsa --

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.367
'Madharsa' means a 'school'.

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:29.492
And in that school they used to admit small children.

00:15:31.367 --> 00:15:36.784
And it was so well planned that God doesn't know --

00:15:37.534 --> 00:15:39.534
I mean I can't say,

00:15:40.617 --> 00:15:45.784
that there were 120 Madharsas only in Delhi!

00:15:47.826 --> 00:15:50.575
Now nobody knew what they are teaching there,

00:15:51.826 --> 00:15:56.534
what they are mesmerising, how they are doing this.

00:15:59.492 --> 00:16:03.575
It so happened once I went to

00:16:05.534 --> 00:16:09.158
this place, Nizamudhin,

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:14.700
and there I found people singing songs and all that.

00:16:17.784 --> 00:16:22.784
And I found in them a real feeling for love.

00:16:23.534 --> 00:16:26.408
They felt My love, very much, all of them,

00:16:27.158 --> 00:16:29.492
and they started coming to Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:31.408 --> 00:16:34.408
But I didn't know there was a Madharsa in that place.

00:16:36.242 --> 00:16:41.117
I asked them "Why is it, here the vibrations,

00:16:41.659 --> 00:16:44.367
Nizamudhin was an aulia (saint).

00:16:45.283 --> 00:16:49.325
And how is that the place doesn't have good vibrations?"

00:16:50.283 --> 00:16:53.408
In between I used to get very bad vibrations.

00:16:54.408 --> 00:16:57.826
So they told me "Mother, there is a Madharsa".

00:16:58.575 --> 00:17:01.659
Now look at the evil, how it works.

00:17:03.659 --> 00:17:08.534
Normally, evil used to work like this, that it would go and

00:17:11.617 --> 00:17:17.700
form some groups, some wars, and kill people.

00:17:28.158 --> 00:17:32.325
They were few people, but they had

00:17:33.659 --> 00:17:36.659
cruelty as their religion.

00:17:37.659 --> 00:17:44.742
Which ever way they lived, they wanted to be cruel.

00:17:48.242 --> 00:17:52.492
In those Madharsas only, they had people who used to

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.826
tell them how to be cruel, how to hate.

00:17:56.742 --> 00:18:00.784
So 'education in hatred' started.

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:06.700
And that education of hatred

00:18:09.158 --> 00:18:12.659
was very well woven through these Madharsas,

00:18:14.158 --> 00:18:15.826
all over the world.

00:18:18.826 --> 00:18:22.492
Now, as you know,

00:18:23.617 --> 00:18:27.534
Pakistan and India were always fighting.

00:18:30.408 --> 00:18:35.659
But this time Pakistanis realised

00:18:36.826 --> 00:18:40.283
that 'If we fight with India in that way

00:18:40.534 --> 00:18:43.283
we will be called as terrorists'.

00:18:45.367 --> 00:18:51.325
So they said "No, we will have no terrorism in our country".

00:18:52.659 --> 00:18:56.283
But they are the ones stupidly --this new fellow

00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:02.742
had sent about 65 scholars, ambassadors,

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:09.617
to Afghanistan to study in those Madharsas,

00:19:10.325 --> 00:19:13.784
how to become cruel  can you imagine!

00:19:16.617 --> 00:19:19.408
To teach hatred!

00:19:22.492 --> 00:19:25.700
Of course there are many Muslims who are not;

00:19:28.242 --> 00:19:33.283
but if you do not respect Mohammed Saab

00:19:34.659 --> 00:19:37.200
and you are supposed to be a Muslim,

00:19:37.826 --> 00:19:39.784
what will come out of you?

00:19:42.784 --> 00:19:46.242
So, all these wrong ideas grew up

00:19:46.784 --> 00:19:53.575
and Islam got divided

00:19:53.784 --> 00:19:55.826
into many groups.

00:19:57.408 --> 00:20:02.242
It's alright, but to have this kind of a group

00:20:02.742 --> 00:20:05.575
that is against all humanity

00:20:06.534 --> 00:20:10.200
was the most dangerous plan!

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:16.367
I don't know how many Muslims also knew about it.

00:20:21.367 --> 00:20:26.575
They spread this Madharsa thing all over the world

00:20:27.784 --> 00:20:33.534
and people coming out of that institution

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:38.158
became very, very cruel people.

00:20:39.534 --> 00:20:43.450
The first cruelty was to the women.

00:20:45.158 --> 00:20:48.408
Women were treated with such contempt,

00:20:50.325 --> 00:20:55.784
and absolutely no respect of any kind

00:20:56.742 --> 00:20:58.617
was given to them.

00:21:00.158 --> 00:21:07.575
This itself shows that there was no-one to control them.

00:21:10.534 --> 00:21:16.450
It's not written in Koran, it's not described by Mohammed Saab.

00:21:18.283 --> 00:21:23.283
He says "God is merciful;

00:21:26.117 --> 00:21:28.575
He is peace-giving".

00:21:32.325 --> 00:21:36.575
Whatever he did was absolutely divine, no doubt.

00:21:38.575 --> 00:21:43.617
But some of these people, the way they took to satanic forces,

00:21:47.325 --> 00:21:53.575
people started misunderstanding Islam.

00:21:55.158 --> 00:21:57.283
'Islam' means 'to surrender'.

00:21:58.784 --> 00:22:01.700
Those who are surrendered are you people.

00:22:03.408 --> 00:22:08.117
Surrendered means those who have given up

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:12.575
all their lust, greed and all these enemies,

00:22:13.367 --> 00:22:19.742
and are above normal people.

00:22:21.534 --> 00:22:24.492
Another thing, it was very interesting

00:22:24.826 --> 00:22:27.617
to note that Mohammed Saab had said

00:22:28.158 --> 00:22:33.283
that "At the time of resurrection, you hands would

00:22:35.784 --> 00:22:40.575
speak". That he clearly said.

00:22:42.408 --> 00:22:45.617
Naturally, because it was written

00:22:47.575 --> 00:22:51.700
in a language which was all poetic,

00:22:53.492 --> 00:22:57.659
people can, if they want to, they can twist it.

00:23:00.408 --> 00:23:06.617
But Mohammed Saab never, never could have said

00:23:13.492 --> 00:23:19.242
It's very, very shocking that in these modern times

00:23:24.492 --> 00:23:28.659
that people have taken to such

00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:34.325
crooked ideas.

00:23:37.158 --> 00:23:43.450
But for that, the reason is that

00:23:45.617 --> 00:23:49.325
people also develop resistance for them.

00:23:52.617 --> 00:23:57.617
Jews -- they developed a resistance for them.

00:24:03.575 --> 00:24:08.158
This hatred is responsible,

00:24:09.408 --> 00:24:13.200
and this hatred between both the sides,

00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:20.158
I would say now, is that two different ...

00:24:23.283 --> 00:24:26.700
it's very evident.

00:24:32.158 --> 00:24:36.659
Now, in Sahaja Yoga,

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:42.826
you believe in complete

00:24:44.158 --> 00:24:50.158
innocent, simple existence together.

00:24:54.367 --> 00:25:00.283
And that people believe

00:25:01.617 --> 00:25:07.617
that there is definitely different groups of people. ......

00:25:16.742 --> 00:25:22.575
Now what is our duty?  What are we supposed to do?

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:29.367
First of all, we have to introspect.

00:25:30.367 --> 00:25:34.158
Supposing you are a Hindu, born,

00:25:36.283 --> 00:25:39.617
you should sit down and find out if you hate

00:25:39.826 --> 00:25:42.450
anybody because he's a Muslim.

00:25:44.408 --> 00:25:45.826
You can't hate!

00:25:47.325 --> 00:25:50.325
Because somebody is a Muslim, you can't hate him.

00:25:51.408 --> 00:25:55.492
Because you are a Muslim, because you are surrendered,

00:25:57.826 --> 00:26:01.700
so how can you hate anyone?

00:26:08.242 --> 00:26:13.283
If you are surrendered, you are surrendered to the Divine,

00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:18.826
and how can you then be against the Divine?

00:26:21.283 --> 00:26:25.408
So these misleading thoughts

00:26:26.659 --> 00:26:29.742
and ideas should be given up.

00:26:38.784 --> 00:26:42.242
Supposing you are a Hindu --

00:26:45.617 --> 00:26:49.492
so you have no business to hate anyone!

00:26:53.283 --> 00:26:55.450
That is for definite!

00:26:55.659 --> 00:26:59.742
Now the word 'Hindu' also comes from the River Sindhu

00:27:01.158 --> 00:27:06.700
because Alexander couldn't say 'Sindhu' so he said 'Hindu'.

00:27:08.534 --> 00:27:13.742
And on that point many people have built

00:27:14.534 --> 00:27:22.408
this horrible hatred in India.

00:27:24.367 --> 00:27:29.492
But cruelty was not their theme.

00:27:31.826 --> 00:27:39.534
That was the saving point.  That they didn't want to torture people.

00:27:42.117 --> 00:27:47.742
So this aptitude to torture or to hate people

00:27:48.367 --> 00:27:53.283
is coming form other sources.

00:27:54.325 --> 00:27:57.117
And the source is,

00:28:00.158 --> 00:28:05.826
as you can see clearly, that they openly hate.

00:28:08.575 --> 00:28:11.700
To hate is a very bad quality.

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:16.367
One of the most dangerous things is to hate.

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:20.450
And so you all must know ......

00:28:28.408 --> 00:28:32.742
alright. Now we are having a ...

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:58.534
To me, it is very painful

00:29:00.242 --> 00:29:04.325
to think that we human beings,

00:29:05.367 --> 00:29:07.700
(that) we hate others,

00:29:10.158 --> 00:29:15.492
when you know that love is such an overwhelming,

00:29:16.283 --> 00:29:19.784
beautiful feeling.

00:29:22.784 --> 00:29:27.700
But why then do you take to hatred?

00:29:33.325 --> 00:29:37.534
Because people have

00:29:39.492 --> 00:29:44.117
impressed you, they have told you lies,

00:29:45.617 --> 00:29:49.617
that's why you hate.  What an achievement!

00:29:50.367 --> 00:29:55.742
First to be a human being, and then to be a person full of hatred!

00:29:57.659 --> 00:30:00.534
Now what will be the next, I don't know!

00:30:03.325 --> 00:30:07.283
It was alright in those days for the Goddess to kill.

00:30:12.408 --> 00:30:16.700
The Goddess used to kill all such people  ...

00:30:28.534 --> 00:30:32.700
It's a very sad feeling

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:37.826
that God has created human beings

00:30:38.742 --> 00:30:45.742
from amoeba to this stage, and how can we hate someone --

00:30:50.659 --> 00:30:53.325
and this is what has happened!

00:30:56.242 --> 00:30:58.742
Now of course Sahaj is different.

00:31:00.283 --> 00:31:04.283
The Sahajis know how to enjoy love.

00:31:07.826 --> 00:31:10.408
They like it.

00:31:10.659 --> 00:31:14.742
They enjoy it. You can see that.

00:31:19.158 --> 00:31:23.784
And if somehow, you people

00:31:24.784 --> 00:31:27.784
could manage to remove this hatred --

00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:38.617
somehow, somehow -- with your own will-power --

00:31:40.534 --> 00:31:46.325
denying and defying all that is being told to human beings,

00:31:48.283 --> 00:31:50.742
I am sure ....

00:31:57.325 --> 00:32:01.534
It's a very difficult work

00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:05.492
where those people who came

00:32:06.283 --> 00:32:09.158
on this earth went through all kinds of

00:32:09.742 --> 00:32:13.784
education, wanted

00:32:15.617 --> 00:32:22.492
to improve the conditions, the relationships, friendships,

00:32:23.492 --> 00:32:29.450
have fallen into the depths of hatred ...

00:32:47.492 --> 00:32:51.117
My heart just weeps.

00:32:54.492 --> 00:32:58.325
At what time I have come on this earth,

00:32:59.492 --> 00:33:04.367
where I have to see human beings hating each other.

00:33:09.283 --> 00:33:12.534
They talk of 'love' and 'hate'.

00:33:15.492 --> 00:33:17.700
It's a very serious thing,

00:33:19.408 --> 00:33:24.408
that you who are the children ...

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:30.450
they'll end up like this ...

00:33:43.450 --> 00:33:48.659
I mean, I have experiences that if I tell you you'll be shocked.

00:33:50.367 --> 00:33:58.158
How people have fallen down to the depth of evil nature.

00:34:02.325 --> 00:34:07.826
It's an understanding

00:34:11.534 --> 00:34:16.158
we have, to have understanding

00:34:18.325 --> 00:34:22.784
about ourselves: Do we hate somebody?

00:34:23.617 --> 00:34:28.659
Do we get ideas that we shouldn't have, or do things? ...

00:34:30.742 --> 00:34:35.826
Do you have such things in you?  Just find out!

00:34:37.325 --> 00:34:40.659
Do you hate other people?

00:34:49.784 --> 00:34:57.200
The ideas are rotten, absolutely, for the human mind.

00:34:59.784 --> 00:35:04.700
The ideas which are completely

00:35:07.283 --> 00:35:10.283
like the animals' instinct,

00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:16.534
are absolutely no good for human beings at all.

00:35:17.575 --> 00:35:22.325
But that is what is happening, and it's coming forward ...

00:35:29.158 --> 00:35:33.450
If you are poor, alright,

00:35:34.408 --> 00:35:39.617
but by hating you don't become rich, no.

00:35:42.617 --> 00:35:47.826
If you are in any difficulties,

00:35:50.659 --> 00:35:56.575
then your duty is to remove those difficulties,

00:35:57.325 --> 00:35:59.826
but not to prosper on them.

00:36:02.617 --> 00:36:05.158
All this has to finish.

00:36:07.367 --> 00:36:12.283
It is very surprising that we are not bothered at all

00:36:12.784 --> 00:36:15.450
as to what we are doing.

00:36:19.742 --> 00:36:24.117
Yes, you have to have proper

00:36:25.117 --> 00:36:28.575
sense of understanding:

00:36:33.242 --> 00:36:35.659
where are we going?

00:36:40.283 --> 00:36:45.408
If  you have misunderstanding about somebody,

00:36:45.826 --> 00:36:48.450
better take it out, completely.

00:36:52.367 --> 00:36:54.283
They try to trouble you, alright.

00:36:54.492 --> 00:37:00.534
But don't have bad understanding about that person.

00:37:04.158 --> 00:37:10.283
Very surprising that we never see those things,

00:37:11.283 --> 00:37:17.117
how ugly they are, and how funny they are,

00:37:17.283 --> 00:37:19.659
how they ruin our personality.

00:37:24.283 --> 00:37:29.408
You may be able to correct some people ...

00:37:48.534 --> 00:37:53.617
All our activities as Sahaja Yogis,

00:37:54.784 --> 00:37:59.283
I never realised were so important!

00:38:01.575 --> 00:38:04.283
We have to give so much time.

00:38:09.242 --> 00:38:12.826
Not to bother about nonsensical, frivolous things,

00:38:13.408 --> 00:38:18.659
but something serious that is within us or without,

00:38:19.659 --> 00:38:21.826
that must be taken out..

00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:33.283
If I ask you, 'How many people you hate?'

00:38:34.242 --> 00:38:41.408
You may say '20 people' and ...

00:39:01.617 --> 00:39:09.450
You see the whole atmosphere in all this

00:39:10.408 --> 00:39:14.784
fills me with such remorse

00:39:16.283 --> 00:39:22.200
that I just don't know what are we going to do, the Sahaja Yogis.

00:39:27.408 --> 00:39:29.784
What are their plans?

00:39:31.325 --> 00:39:36.242
Will you please look into yourself

00:39:37.575 --> 00:39:44.283
and think what constructive work we are doing

00:39:45.367 --> 00:39:49.242
and what destructive work we have been doing.

00:39:51.617 --> 00:39:54.575
You need a big shock to understand this.

00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:03.283
I like the way we have programmes and Pujas and all that,

00:40:03.826 --> 00:40:06.700
but if you ask My Inner Being,

00:40:08.242 --> 00:40:12.450
I know it is very, very unhappy, very sick.

00:40:14.826 --> 00:40:20.742
At this time, what you have to do as Sahaja Yogis ...

00:40:25.659 --> 00:40:30.158
as Sahaja Yogis, minimum of minimum

00:40:30.534 --> 00:40:33.158
you should put full attention.

00:40:36.492 --> 00:40:41.575
And then you have to tell everybody ...

00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:47.450
You see the trouble with Sahaja Yoga is

00:40:48.325 --> 00:40:51.325
that you all start enjoying yourself,

00:40:52.575 --> 00:40:56.367
and then you don't see around what is happening.

00:40:59.242 --> 00:41:03.158
Now I must tell you

00:41:04.325 --> 00:41:11.158
I am now in the midst of war

00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:15.492
between myth ...

00:41:19.659 --> 00:41:26.117
Is it an area, is it a --

00:41:27.659 --> 00:41:31.575
I don't know what should I say --is it (that)

00:41:33.283 --> 00:41:37.534
within us there is still lurking

00:41:39.784 --> 00:41:43.826
some kind of a weakness

00:41:45.367 --> 00:41:52.367
that we do not try to fight our weakness ...

00:41:59.158 --> 00:42:04.408
I would now request you all to meditate

00:42:06.617 --> 00:42:09.450
on yourself,

00:42:11.784 --> 00:42:18.158
and see for yourself what is wrong. ...

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:32.242
It's a big shock,

00:42:35.492 --> 00:42:41.367
and to reduce this shock, what can Sahaja Yogis do?

00:42:44.367 --> 00:42:52.283
What can they work it out to blast this horrible

00:42:57.117 --> 00:42:59.325
ways of human life?

00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:07.826
It's possible with the Power of Love --

00:43:09.450 --> 00:43:11.700
you can manage!

00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:16.826
But we must develop that power in our hearts.

00:43:19.117 --> 00:43:25.283
Think of it!  It's a big lesson now for all of us,

00:43:27.158 --> 00:43:29.575
to see for ourselves --

00:43:30.617 --> 00:43:35.492
are we alright?  Or we go on hating others?

00:43:39.617 --> 00:43:46.492
What is the function of our mind, is to hate or to love?

00:43:48.742 --> 00:43:54.158
And this love, if it enlightens you,

00:43:55.575 --> 00:43:59.283
you will be amazed, you will be such a big force for Me.

00:44:01.617 --> 00:44:04.700
I cannot fight the whole thing alone.

00:44:05.367 --> 00:44:08.450
I have to have people who really

00:44:11.492 --> 00:44:18.408
develop their love -- and nothing else!

00:44:20.826 --> 00:44:25.450
That is one of the challenges now for all of us,

00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:30.158
for all the Sahaja Yogis all over the world.

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:39.826
It's not only the fight between believers and non-believers,

00:44:41.117 --> 00:44:48.659
not only the fight between Sahaja Yogis and non-Sahaja Yogis,

00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:58.367
but this is a fight where we are all one

00:44:59.617 --> 00:45:02.534
and we are going to fight it out.

00:45:03.826 --> 00:45:09.408
At every stage we have to be much more subtler.

00:45:16.408 --> 00:45:23.492
It is very, very essential to see to the point today --

00:45:24.408 --> 00:45:31.242
are we also part and parcel of that evil thing that is working out?

00:45:31.784 --> 00:45:36.617
Or are we free from that,

00:45:37.408 --> 00:45:40.617
and prepared to fight it?

00:45:45.826 --> 00:45:51.117
It's a big fight and I hope it is conclusive!.

00:45:52.742 --> 00:45:58.534
After this there will be no more of

00:46:00.283 --> 00:46:02.617
cruelties to human beings,

00:46:05.283 --> 00:46:07.700
no more fights,

00:46:09.659 --> 00:46:15.742
because this is a fight between the rakshasas

00:46:16.575 --> 00:46:22.700
and ourselves.  It is not 'ordinary'.

00:46:25.450 --> 00:46:27.617
And this has to be explained,

00:46:28.534 --> 00:46:32.575
also to those who are supportive of evil forces.

00:46:37.117 --> 00:46:42.117
Only thing, 'Mother how are we to know

00:46:42.492 --> 00:46:44.784
who is against and who is not?'

00:46:45.784 --> 00:46:51.242
You are knowledgeable; you are Sahaja Yogis,

00:46:52.367 --> 00:46:59.408
you know who is on the wrong side.

00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:05.325
I know Sahaja Yogis can save,

00:47:06.617 --> 00:47:11.700
and can bring them to the right path of knowledge and love.

00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:18.492
But -- be very careful with the propaganda

00:47:19.659 --> 00:47:22.450
of evil that is going on.

00:47:25.742 --> 00:47:30.367
I want to touch the deepest part of your heart,

00:47:32.617 --> 00:47:34.826
which should reconcile ...

00:47:40.534 --> 00:47:45.742
I am sure you all will understand

00:47:46.450 --> 00:47:50.784
the magnitude of danger that awaits!

00:47:52.784 --> 00:47:57.700
Maybe there may not be any human beings left,

00:47:58.826 --> 00:48:02.700
maybe there may not be any children left.

00:48:04.408 --> 00:48:08.325
Because if this kind of thing is working out,

00:48:10.283 --> 00:48:13.325
it is very difficult, very difficult  ...

00:48:28.742 --> 00:48:30.784
My whole existence

00:48:32.659 --> 00:48:37.659
gets shaky, gets shaken up.

00:48:39.325 --> 00:48:43.575
You all should see in every

00:48:44.325 --> 00:48:47.200
nook and corner of life:

00:48:48.408 --> 00:48:53.826
Where is this talk going on?  Where are people talking of cruelty?

00:48:54.492 --> 00:48:59.450
What's happening? ...

00:49:12.617 --> 00:49:17.367
Whatever I think ...

00:49:23.575 --> 00:49:28.659
it's not one, it's not two, it's all of us.   ...

00:49:44.659 --> 00:49:51.283
The fight that I am having is of a very serious nature, no doubt.

00:49:52.325 --> 00:49:58.492
But if you all can fight collectively, how much

00:49:59.659 --> 00:50:01.325
we can work it out! ...

00:50:15.408 --> 00:50:19.325
My all efforts,

00:50:21.242 --> 00:50:25.117
understandings, powers,

00:50:25.826 --> 00:50:29.283
everything is now in your hands,

00:50:31.784 --> 00:50:35.450
and that's what you should be prepared for.

00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:42.784
Not by just reading something or

00:50:44.283 --> 00:50:47.617
talking about it, you have to build up within yourself

00:50:48.283 --> 00:50:50.492
the power of love.

00:50:55.158 --> 00:51:00.367
I am sure with the opening of the Sahasrara you will do.

00:51:01.283 --> 00:51:06.450
But try to read something, to understand something,

00:51:07.242 --> 00:51:09.450
with the Power of Love.

00:51:10.742 --> 00:51:14.659
It's a very deep subject, and when you talk about it,

00:51:15.242 --> 00:51:17.534
half-way I'm inside, half-way outside.

00:51:18.826 --> 00:51:22.450
But I have to tell you that you all develop this,

00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:30.492
and only that (Power of Love) will form a very strong opposition

00:51:31.367 --> 00:51:34.700
to these 'evil doers' as they call it. ...

00:51:45.450 --> 00:51:49.450
My complete blessings are on you,

00:51:50.784 --> 00:51:56.367
and I want all of you to individually work it out.

00:51:57.659 --> 00:52:00.659
How many people you love, how many people ...

00:52:04.534 --> 00:52:06.659
This you have to find out.

00:52:17.659 --> 00:52:22.534
I hope you people have understood what I want you to do. ...

00:52:32.158 --> 00:52:34.826
A new generation is coming up  ...

00:52:47.242 --> 00:52:52.158
All of you, all of you, are in My Heart,

00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:57.367
and I love you very much,

00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:00.700
and I want you people

00:53:03.325 --> 00:53:07.408
to come as soldiers to fight with Me.

00:53:12.826 --> 00:53:18.367
I am also told that there are some people who are forming groups --

00:53:19.158 --> 00:53:20.742
extremely negative attitude!

00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:25.242
At this time what we need is complete solidarity.

00:53:27.450 --> 00:53:32.367
So all such people whom you see, tell them to behave themselves!

00:53:33.826 --> 00:53:36.325
No use making them Sahaja Yogis.

00:53:41.325 --> 00:53:49.242
I am sure -- it's really heartfelt -- desire of mine

00:53:50.784 --> 00:53:56.283
that you should become really soldiers of love and peace.

00:53:57.534 --> 00:54:04.158
Because that is why you are here, you are born here for that.

00:54:06.283 --> 00:54:08.325
So enjoy yourself.
