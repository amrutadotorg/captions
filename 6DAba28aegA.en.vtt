00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:30.504
Today we have gathered here to do Puja to Bhairavnath.

00:02:31.712 --> 00:02:35.557
I think we have not understood

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:41.205
the significance of Bhairavnath

00:02:41.365 --> 00:02:51.048
who runs, and up and down on the Ida Nadi.

00:03:21.098 --> 00:03:27.934
Ida Nadi is the Nadi of Chandrama, is of the moon.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:43.800
So, this is a channel for us to cool down.

00:03:50.616 --> 00:03:58.494
So the work of Bhairavnathji is to cool us down.

00:04:04.397 --> 00:04:08.867
For example, people have a hot temper,

00:04:09.027 --> 00:04:13.300
with their ego, with their liver, whatever it is.

00:04:21.768 --> 00:04:28.787
And if a person is in a big temper,

00:04:28.947 --> 00:04:34.799
then Bhairavnath plays tricks on that person

00:04:35.004 --> 00:04:37.555
to cool him down.

00:04:45.887 --> 00:04:52.904
He organises everything under his own control

00:04:53.064 --> 00:04:56.398
with ganas help, with Ganapati's help,

00:04:56.558 --> 00:05:01.424
to cool down your temperament, to give you a balance.

00:05:13.824 --> 00:05:17.896
So, if somebody is a very hot-tempered person,

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:24.077
and he crosses all the limits of his temper,

00:05:24.237 --> 00:05:26.842
then somehow or other,

00:05:27.002 --> 00:05:30.092
Bhairavnath will organize,

00:05:30.252 --> 00:05:33.369
also with the help of Hanumana,

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:39.769
to show that this stupidity of anger is no good.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:06.406
So, for example, people who are depressed

00:06:06.566 --> 00:06:09.201
or who become left-sided,

00:06:09.361 --> 00:06:15.327
Hanumana tries to help them to come out of it.

00:06:15.487 --> 00:06:21.687
No doubt, but also Bhairavnath helps them

00:06:21.847 --> 00:06:25.806
very much more to come out of it.

00:06:38.212 --> 00:06:46.170
Now, a person who is left-sided cannot be collective.

00:06:50.975 --> 00:06:54.189
It is very difficult for a person

00:06:54.349 --> 00:06:58.074
who is very left-sided,

00:06:58.234 --> 00:07:03.987
who is all the time feeling very sad,

00:07:04.147 --> 00:07:07.423
unhappy and worried,

00:07:07.583 --> 00:07:11.628
cannot enjoy the fun of collectivity.

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:27.656
While a hot-tempered person, a right-sided person,

00:07:27.816 --> 00:07:30.093
does not enjoy any collectivity,

00:07:30.253 --> 00:07:32.746
doesn’t allow anybody to enjoy collectivity, no doubt,

00:07:32.906 --> 00:07:37.974
but tries to be in the collective that it can assert.

00:07:52.476 --> 00:07:55.706
Because such a person tries to show the superiority,

00:07:55.866 --> 00:07:57.729
is something superior.

00:07:57.889 --> 00:08:03.193
Naturally he cannot enjoy the collective.

00:08:11.708 --> 00:08:15.909
On the contrary, the person who is depressed,

00:08:16.069 --> 00:08:18.056
all the time thinks,

00:08:18.216 --> 00:08:20.813
"Nobody loves me, nobody cares for me,

00:08:20.973 --> 00:08:23.063
I'm so depressed,” this, that,

00:08:23.223 --> 00:08:26.367
all the time expecting from others something,

00:08:26.527 --> 00:08:31.820
also cannot enjoy the collective.

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:51.892
Such a left-sided person will find

00:08:52.052 --> 00:08:58.475
everything is something unhappy.

00:09:06.694 --> 00:09:09.348
Like the other day, I went to Moscow.

00:09:09.508 --> 00:09:13.574
There was a lady with us who was a Sahaja Yogini,

00:09:13.734 --> 00:09:17.140
left-sided Sahaja Yogini.

00:09:24.213 --> 00:09:27.555
So, we went to have our food

00:09:27.715 --> 00:09:32.661
and it started raining and they couldn't get a taxi,

00:09:40.928 --> 00:09:44.485
but then a car came in and we went there.

00:09:48.774 --> 00:09:51.587
Then they said that

00:09:51.747 --> 00:09:54.875
“You are very late so you have to sit on the other side,

00:09:55.035 --> 00:09:59.000
you have to take the seats which were more expensive.”

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.121
So this lady started saying,

00:10:10.281 --> 00:10:15.404
"What all problems, no taxi, it is raining

00:10:15.564 --> 00:10:18.796
and we can't get a seat."

00:10:28.621 --> 00:10:30.699
I said, “This is all fun;

00:10:30.859 --> 00:10:33.288
this is not something a problem.”

00:10:33.448 --> 00:10:37.017
This 'problema’ word should be given up.

00:10:45.839 --> 00:10:48.487
This is a new word I have learned,

00:10:48.647 --> 00:10:52.996
because 'problem' we used to use only for geometry

00:10:53.156 --> 00:10:55.420
in our young age.

00:11:05.918 --> 00:11:09.437
Now, this sort of a attitude, negative attitude,

00:11:09.597 --> 00:11:12.386
to find everything negative

00:11:12.546 --> 00:11:18.867
is the way we really spoil our left side.

00:11:27.916 --> 00:11:30.514
But then a gentleman who had invited us came

00:11:30.674 --> 00:11:36.241
and he said, “We are sitting on the other side waiting for you.’

00:11:46.019 --> 00:11:48.677
So we went to the other side, enjoyed nice food,

00:11:48.837 --> 00:11:50.247
everything was fine.

00:11:50.407 --> 00:11:52.671
I said, “See now, you were only counting

00:11:52.831 --> 00:11:57.063
how many negative things there are,

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:08.301
and you were not seeing the fun.”

00:12:13.803 --> 00:12:15.721
So she asked Me, "What should I do?" I said,

00:12:15.881 --> 00:12:19.009
“You take Bhairava's name,

00:12:23.608 --> 00:12:25.596
sit with your left hand towards the photograph

00:12:25.756 --> 00:12:27.483
and right hand on the Mother Earth

00:12:27.643 --> 00:12:31.688
and that's how all your bhoots of negativity will go away.”

00:12:38.279 --> 00:12:41.517
So, Bhairava is, always has a light in His hand,

00:12:41.677 --> 00:12:44.807
always light in His hand.

00:12:49.793 --> 00:12:53.456
And He runs up and down

00:12:53.962 --> 00:13:00.746
Ida Nadi to make light for you to see that there's nothing negative.

00:13:07.937 --> 00:13:12.604
And this negativity comes to us by many ways.

00:13:16.582 --> 00:13:20.534
One of the negativities are that,

00:13:20.694 --> 00:13:24.011
"This is mine",

00:13:27.655 --> 00:13:37.377
like, "My child, my husband, my property, my …”

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.653
So then, you see, once you get attached

00:13:44.813 --> 00:13:47.992
in this manner, what you find,

00:13:48.152 --> 00:13:54.387
that your children also become negative.

00:14:00.296 --> 00:14:08.125
But if you want to be positive, it is very easy.

00:14:11.478 --> 00:14:16.902
And for that you should see, ‘Where is your attention?”

00:14:20.262 --> 00:14:22.837
Are you only seeing problema

00:14:22.997 --> 00:14:27.172
or you are seeing some fun in it?

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:41.143
There are people who cannot make fun out of anything.

00:14:44.295 --> 00:14:50.569
If it’s a sunny day they’ll cry, "Oh God, what a sunny day!"

00:14:55.513 --> 00:15:00.084
and if it is a day with clouds they will say,

00:15:00.244 --> 00:15:02.316
"Oh, what a day!"

00:15:06.195 --> 00:15:09.241
Nothing can please them.

00:15:10.502 --> 00:15:16.704
But to enjoy the positivity in every negativity

00:15:16.864 --> 00:15:20.429
is the capacity of a Sahaja Yogi.

00:15:27.712 --> 00:15:34.280
The negativity doesn't exist - it's an ignorance.

00:15:36.845 --> 00:15:40.433
Also, it’s not ignorance, because ignorance also doesn't exist.

00:15:40.593 --> 00:15:43.791
If everything is the All-Pervading Power,

00:15:43.951 --> 00:15:48.107
then how can there be ignorance?

00:15:54.007 --> 00:16:00.451
But supposing, in the folds of this power,

00:16:00.611 --> 00:16:02.888
if you hide, run away,

00:16:03.048 --> 00:16:07.275
you will say that there is negativity.

00:16:14.613 --> 00:16:16.764
Like, you hide yourself in a cave,

00:16:16.924 --> 00:16:22.329
close it properly, and say that there is no sun.

00:16:27.289 --> 00:16:31.718
So those people who cannot become collective,

00:16:31.878 --> 00:16:37.814
are either right-sided or left- sided but more left-sided.

00:16:45.558 --> 00:16:52.400
But left- sided people can be collective in negativity.

00:16:57.152 --> 00:17:01.284
They say there is a very big fraternity of bhoots.

00:17:03.697 --> 00:17:10.138
Ah, you see some drunkards sitting together.

00:17:13.214 --> 00:17:18.361
They are saying, "See there's so many problem, ecological problem."

00:17:18.521 --> 00:17:20.660
They are drunkards, all drunk,

00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:24.666
and "There are problems of so other kinds.

00:17:24.826 --> 00:17:28.891
When will this end?"

00:17:38.333 --> 00:17:40.835
So the another one says, "Wait, wait, wait.

00:17:40.995 --> 00:17:46.084
I've heard that the whole world is going to collapse very soon."

00:17:56.186 --> 00:17:57.522
Then the third one says,

00:17:57.682 --> 00:18:01.956
"Thank God! We are going to be collapsed, finished."

00:18:04.486 --> 00:18:11.459
Then fourth one says, "But what will happen to our pubs?"

00:18:15.884 --> 00:18:22.069
They say, "It's all right. If we are not existing, what does it matter?"

00:18:25.312 --> 00:18:31.225
That's how the fraternity of the bhoots act.

00:18:32.762 --> 00:18:35.315
They cannot see fun at all,

00:18:35.383 --> 00:18:38.668
they cannot enjoy at all,

00:18:42.057 --> 00:18:44.511
and they become very,

00:18:44.615 --> 00:18:47.085
sort of think they are very meditative,

00:18:47.221 --> 00:18:51.051
they are some higher people, they are something superior

00:18:51.037 --> 00:18:54.181
in negativity.

00:19:06.203 --> 00:19:11.302
But, end of these people is that they become lunatics,

00:19:14.105 --> 00:19:19.863
while the end of the right-sided - they become idiotic.

00:19:23.839 --> 00:19:27.793
Once I went to a lunatic asylum,

00:19:30.139 --> 00:19:33.435
and while going there I met a lady,

00:19:33.595 --> 00:19:36.303
and she was quite all right, I mean,

00:19:36.463 --> 00:19:38.828
I thought she was a quite all right woman,

00:19:38.916 --> 00:19:42.212
so I started talking to her.

00:19:49.895 --> 00:19:51.904
And she started talking very wisely,

00:19:52.064 --> 00:19:54.443
"See, my brother- in- law is there, and

00:19:54.603 --> 00:19:57.922
isn't it necessary that he should be helped,

00:19:58.082 --> 00:19:59.789
and we should not do this, that..."

00:19:59.949 --> 00:20:04.046
All kinds of things she was telling Me,

00:20:11.657 --> 00:20:15.177
showing Me, as if she was very nice and kind

00:20:15.222 --> 00:20:18.794
and no one loves her.

00:20:24.857 --> 00:20:28.788
And she said, “I'm very insecure” and this and that.

00:20:32.432 --> 00:20:36.316
Suddenly the doctor came in

00:20:36.749 --> 00:20:40.327
and she started abusing him, shouting at him.

00:20:40.487 --> 00:20:43.673
I said, “What's this?”

00:20:50.309 --> 00:20:53.111
So the doctor sent for people that,

00:20:53.271 --> 00:20:54.820
"Catch hold of this woman!"

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:59.154
He told Me, “She's the most violent lunatic

00:21:05.566 --> 00:21:08.297
and why are You talking to her?”

00:21:08.979 --> 00:21:14.821
I did have a headache but I didn't know she was a lunatic.

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:21.705
Maybe in My presence, as bhoot might have little bit

00:21:21.865 --> 00:21:23.923
run away and were playing tricks,

00:21:24.083 --> 00:21:28.652
but you can see that, clearly.

00:21:34.569 --> 00:21:37.149
So, this emotional attachment is too much,

00:21:37.309 --> 00:21:41.199
and to emotionally, to worry about somebody, that

00:21:41.359 --> 00:21:45.877
you see, “This is my child, this is my this thing,

00:21:46.037 --> 00:21:47.713
this is this and this is that,”

00:21:47.873 --> 00:21:50.521
and all the time wasting your precious life

00:21:50.681 --> 00:21:55.812
in these things is not the way a Sahaja Yogi should live.

00:22:06.708 --> 00:22:09.058
If a Sahaja Yogi cannot become collective,

00:22:09.218 --> 00:22:12.998
then know that he is not a Sahaja Yogi.

00:22:19.464 --> 00:22:21.155
So, one has to know that

00:22:21.315 --> 00:22:25.502
this is the work of Bhairavnath within us.

00:22:28.866 --> 00:22:32.521
Another work that He gives us light in darkness is that,

00:22:32.681 --> 00:22:39.821
that He, He destroys all the bhoots within us.

00:22:45.985 --> 00:22:49.281
And all kinds of bhootish ideas

00:22:50.806 --> 00:22:55.560
and funny ideas about attachments

00:22:59.002 --> 00:23:02.332
and also the depressiveness.

00:23:03.987 --> 00:23:05.542
So, today we are, I am very happy

00:23:05.702 --> 00:23:09.442
that we are worshipping Shri Bhairava

00:23:09.602 --> 00:23:14.970
because He is very much connected with Ganesha.

00:23:20.858 --> 00:23:24.360
As you know Shri Ganesha is at the Mooladhara

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:28.629
and while Bhairava moves onto the left side

00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:32.813
and goes to the right side.

00:23:39.317 --> 00:23:43.725
So, all kinds of conditionings, all kinds of habits,

00:23:43.885 --> 00:23:50.578
can be conquered through the help of Bhairavnath.

00:23:58.168 --> 00:24:03.305
In Nepal we have a very huge, big Bhairavnath statue

00:24:03.465 --> 00:24:07.366
which is really Swayambhu.

00:24:11.129 --> 00:24:13.644
And people are more left-sided,

00:24:13.804 --> 00:24:17.370
so they are afraid of Bhairavnath.

00:24:21.449 --> 00:24:25.334
So, if somebody has a bad habit, say, of stealing,

00:24:25.494 --> 00:24:28.201
they take him to the, to in front of Bhairavnath

00:24:28.361 --> 00:24:33.746
and put His light there, make a flame.

00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:44.578
I mean, the police takes them,

00:24:44.691 --> 00:24:51.070
and then they ask them, "Now, say before Bhairavnath, confess it."

00:24:56.393 --> 00:25:01.459
And they confess what wrong they have done.

00:25:01.619 --> 00:25:11.311
So, He protect us, also from doing wrong things,

00:25:11.418 --> 00:25:14.972
sly things like thieving.

00:25:22.445 --> 00:25:25.507
Whatever we think we can do secretly, can be hidden,

00:25:25.667 --> 00:25:29.900
but you cannot hide it from Bhairavnath.

00:25:36.232 --> 00:25:41.310
If you don't change, then He exposes you completely.

00:25:43.974 --> 00:25:49.858
That's how He has exposed  all the horrible false gurus.

00:25:53.667 --> 00:25:57.779
So, today we are here to worship

00:25:57.939 --> 00:26:00.381
this great Deity of Bhiaravnatha

00:26:00.541 --> 00:26:05.114
who incarnated on this earth later on,

00:26:13.073 --> 00:26:16.581
ultimately as Mahavira also.

00:26:17.715 --> 00:26:22.473
So, He stands on the gate of hell

00:26:25.418 --> 00:26:29.519
and stops people from falling into hell.

00:26:34.042 --> 00:26:36.441
But if you want to go to hell,

00:26:36.601 --> 00:26:39.729
if it is your desire, is your willpower like that working,

00:26:39.889 --> 00:26:41.436
that I should go to hell,then He says,

00:26:41.596 --> 00:26:45.485
‘All right, you can go.’

00:26:51.726 --> 00:26:58.196
But as you know, now the hell is also full of people,

00:27:02.015 --> 00:27:08.097
so is better that we should try to fight our negativity

00:27:08.257 --> 00:27:15.161
and become fun-loving, enjoying others, loving others,

00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:31.482
not worrying about what others are doing to you,

00:27:31.642 --> 00:27:36.906
but only thinking what good you can do to others.

00:27:45.936 --> 00:27:53.388
So today's special Puja for Bhairavnath we offer,

00:27:56.421 --> 00:28:03.551
to give us a sense to laugh, to enjoy, to have fun.

00:28:12.109 --> 00:28:15.679
May God bless you all.
