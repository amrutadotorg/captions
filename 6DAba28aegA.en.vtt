WEBVTT

02:19.800 --> 02:30.504
Today we have gathered here to do Puja to Bhairavnath.

02:31.712 --> 02:35.557
I think we have not understood

02:35.709 --> 02:41.205
the significance of Bhairavnath

02:41.365 --> 02:51.048
who runs, and up and down on the Ida Nadi.

03:21.098 --> 03:27.934
Ida Nadi is the Nadi of Chandrama, is of the moon.

03:33.360 --> 03:43.800
So, this is a channel for us to cool down.

03:50.616 --> 03:58.494
So the work of Bhairavnathji is to cool us down.

04:04.397 --> 04:08.867
For example, people have a hot temper,

04:09.027 --> 04:13.300
with their ego, with their liver, whatever it is.

04:21.768 --> 04:28.787
And if a person is in a big temper,

04:28.947 --> 04:34.799
then Bhairavnath plays tricks on that person

04:35.004 --> 04:37.555
to cool him down.

04:45.887 --> 04:52.904
He organises everything under his own control

04:53.064 --> 04:56.398
with ganas help, with Ganapati's help,

04:56.558 --> 05:01.424
to cool down your temperament, to give you a balance.

05:13.824 --> 05:17.896
So, if somebody is a very hot-tempered person,

05:18.599 --> 05:24.077
and he crosses all the limits of his temper,

05:24.237 --> 05:26.842
then somehow or other,

05:27.002 --> 05:30.092
Bhairavnath will organize,

05:30.252 --> 05:33.369
also with the help of Hanumana,

05:33.529 --> 05:39.769
to show that this stupidity of anger is no good.

06:01.320 --> 06:06.406
So, for example, people who are depressed

06:06.566 --> 06:09.201
or who become left-sided,

06:09.361 --> 06:15.327
Hanumana tries to help them to come out of it.

06:15.487 --> 06:21.687
No doubt, but also Bhairavnath helps them

06:21.847 --> 06:25.806
very much more to come out of it.

06:38.212 --> 06:46.170
Now, a person who is left-sided cannot be collective.

06:50.975 --> 06:54.189
It is very difficult for a person

06:54.349 --> 06:58.074
who is very left-sided,

06:58.234 --> 07:03.987
who is all the time feeling very sad,

07:04.147 --> 07:07.423
unhappy and worried,

07:07.583 --> 07:11.628
cannot enjoy the fun of collectivity.

07:24.140 --> 07:27.656
While a hot-tempered person, a right-sided person,

07:27.816 --> 07:30.093
does not enjoy any collectivity,

07:30.253 --> 07:32.746
doesn’t allow anybody to enjoy collectivity, no doubt,

07:32.906 --> 07:37.974
but tries to be in the collective that it can assert.

07:52.476 --> 07:55.706
Because such a person tries to show the superiority,

07:55.866 --> 07:57.729
is something superior.

07:57.889 --> 08:03.193
Naturally he cannot enjoy the collective.

08:11.708 --> 08:15.909
On the contrary, the person who is depressed,

08:16.069 --> 08:18.056
all the time thinks,

08:18.216 --> 08:20.813
"Nobody loves me, nobody cares for me,

08:20.973 --> 08:23.063
I'm so depressed,” this, that,

08:23.223 --> 08:26.367
all the time expecting from others something,

08:26.527 --> 08:31.820
also cannot enjoy the collective.

08:49.570 --> 08:51.892
Such a left-sided person will find

08:52.052 --> 08:58.475
everything is something unhappy.

09:06.694 --> 09:09.348
Like the other day, I went to Moscow.

09:09.508 --> 09:13.574
There was a lady with us who was a Sahaja Yogini,

09:13.734 --> 09:17.140
left-sided Sahaja Yogini.

09:24.213 --> 09:27.555
So, we went to have our food

09:27.715 --> 09:32.661
and it started raining and they couldn't get a taxi,

09:40.928 --> 09:44.485
but then a car came in and we went there.

09:48.774 --> 09:51.587
Then they said that

09:51.747 --> 09:54.875
“You are very late so you have to sit on the other side,

09:55.035 --> 09:59.000
you have to take the seats which were more expensive.”

10:08.300 --> 10:10.121
So this lady started saying,

10:10.281 --> 10:15.404
"What all problems, no taxi, it is raining

10:15.564 --> 10:18.796
and we can't get a seat."

10:28.621 --> 10:30.699
I said, “This is all fun;

10:30.859 --> 10:33.288
this is not something a problem.”

10:33.448 --> 10:37.017
This 'problema’ word should be given up.

10:45.839 --> 10:48.487
This is a new word I have learned,

10:48.647 --> 10:52.996
because 'problem' we used to use only for geometry

10:53.156 --> 10:55.420
in our young age.

11:05.918 --> 11:09.437
Now, this sort of a attitude, negative attitude,

11:09.597 --> 11:12.386
to find everything negative

11:12.546 --> 11:18.867
is the way we really spoil our left side.

11:27.916 --> 11:30.514
But then a gentleman who had invited us came

11:30.674 --> 11:36.241
and he said, “We are sitting on the other side waiting for you.’

11:46.019 --> 11:48.677
So we went to the other side, enjoyed nice food,

11:48.837 --> 11:50.247
everything was fine.

11:50.407 --> 11:52.671
I said, “See now, you were only counting

11:52.831 --> 11:57.063
how many negative things there are,

12:04.610 --> 12:08.301
and you were not seeing the fun.”

12:13.803 --> 12:15.721
So she asked Me, "What should I do?" I said,

12:15.881 --> 12:19.009
“You take Bhairava's name,

12:23.608 --> 12:25.596
sit with your left hand towards the photograph

12:25.756 --> 12:27.483
and right hand on the Mother Earth

12:27.643 --> 12:31.688
and that's how all your bhoots of negativity will go away.”

12:38.279 --> 12:41.517
So, Bhairava is, always has a light in His hand,

12:41.677 --> 12:44.807
always light in His hand.

12:49.793 --> 12:53.456
And He runs up and down

12:53.962 --> 13:00.746
Ida Nadi to make light for you to see that there's nothing negative.

13:07.937 --> 13:12.604
And this negativity comes to us by many ways.

13:16.582 --> 13:20.534
One of the negativities are that,

13:20.694 --> 13:24.011
"This is mine",

13:27.655 --> 13:37.377
like, "My child, my husband, my property, my …”

13:42.320 --> 13:44.653
So then, you see, once you get attached

13:44.813 --> 13:47.992
in this manner, what you find,

13:48.152 --> 13:54.387
that your children also become negative.

14:00.296 --> 14:08.125
But if you want to be positive, it is very easy.

14:11.478 --> 14:16.902
And for that you should see, ‘Where is your attention?”

14:20.262 --> 14:22.837
Are you only seeing problema

14:22.997 --> 14:27.172
or you are seeing some fun in it?

14:35.880 --> 14:41.143
There are people who cannot make fun out of anything.

14:44.295 --> 14:50.569
If it’s a sunny day they’ll cry, "Oh God, what a sunny day!"

14:55.513 --> 15:00.084
and if it is a day with clouds they will say,

15:00.244 --> 15:02.316
"Oh, what a day!"

15:06.195 --> 15:09.241
Nothing can please them.

15:10.502 --> 15:16.704
But to enjoy the positivity in every negativity

15:16.864 --> 15:20.429
is the capacity of a Sahaja Yogi.

15:27.712 --> 15:34.280
The negativity doesn't exist - it's an ignorance.

15:36.845 --> 15:40.433
Also, it’s not ignorance, because ignorance also doesn't exist.

15:40.593 --> 15:43.791
If everything is the All-Pervading Power,

15:43.951 --> 15:48.107
then how can there be ignorance?

15:54.007 --> 16:00.451
But supposing, in the folds of this power,

16:00.611 --> 16:02.888
if you hide, run away,

16:03.048 --> 16:07.275
you will say that there is negativity.

16:14.613 --> 16:16.764
Like, you hide yourself in a cave,

16:16.924 --> 16:22.329
close it properly, and say that there is no sun.

16:27.289 --> 16:31.718
So those people who cannot become collective,

16:31.878 --> 16:37.814
are either right-sided or left- sided but more left-sided.

16:45.558 --> 16:52.400
But left- sided people can be collective in negativity.

16:57.152 --> 17:01.284
They say there is a very big fraternity of bhoots.

17:03.697 --> 17:10.138
Ah, you see some drunkards sitting together.

17:13.214 --> 17:18.361
They are saying, "See there's so many problem, ecological problem."

17:18.521 --> 17:20.660
They are drunkards, all drunk,

17:20.820 --> 17:24.666
and "There are problems of so other kinds.

17:24.826 --> 17:28.891
When will this end?"

17:38.333 --> 17:40.835
So the another one says, "Wait, wait, wait.

17:40.995 --> 17:46.084
I've heard that the whole world is going to collapse very soon."

17:56.186 --> 17:57.522
Then the third one says,

17:57.682 --> 18:01.956
"Thank God! We are going to be collapsed, finished."

18:04.486 --> 18:11.459
Then fourth one says, "But what will happen to our pubs?"

18:15.884 --> 18:22.069
They say, "It's all right. If we are not existing, what does it matter?"

18:25.312 --> 18:31.225
That's how the fraternity of the bhoots act.

18:32.762 --> 18:35.315
They cannot see fun at all,

18:35.383 --> 18:38.668
they cannot enjoy at all,

18:42.057 --> 18:44.511
and they become very,

18:44.615 --> 18:47.085
sort of think they are very meditative,

18:47.221 --> 18:51.051
they are some higher people, they are something superior

18:51.037 --> 18:54.181
in negativity.

19:06.203 --> 19:11.302
But, end of these people is that they become lunatics,

19:14.105 --> 19:19.863
while the end of the right-sided - they become idiotic.

19:23.839 --> 19:27.793
Once I went to a lunatic asylum,

19:30.139 --> 19:33.435
and while going there I met a lady,

19:33.595 --> 19:36.303
and she was quite all right, I mean,

19:36.463 --> 19:38.828
I thought she was a quite all right woman,

19:38.916 --> 19:42.212
so I started talking to her.

19:49.895 --> 19:51.904
And she started talking very wisely,

19:52.064 --> 19:54.443
"See, my brother- in- law is there, and

19:54.603 --> 19:57.922
isn't it necessary that he should be helped,

19:58.082 --> 19:59.789
and we should not do this, that..."

19:59.949 --> 20:04.046
All kinds of things she was telling Me,

20:11.657 --> 20:15.177
showing Me, as if she was very nice and kind

20:15.222 --> 20:18.794
and no one loves her.

20:24.857 --> 20:28.788
And she said, “I'm very insecure” and this and that.

20:32.432 --> 20:36.316
Suddenly the doctor came in

20:36.749 --> 20:40.327
and she started abusing him, shouting at him.

20:40.487 --> 20:43.673
I said, “What's this?”

20:50.309 --> 20:53.111
So the doctor sent for people that,

20:53.271 --> 20:54.820
"Catch hold of this woman!"

20:54.980 --> 20:59.154
He told Me, “She's the most violent lunatic

21:05.566 --> 21:08.297
and why are You talking to her?”

21:08.979 --> 21:14.821
I did have a headache but I didn't know she was a lunatic.

21:19.010 --> 21:21.705
Maybe in My presence, as bhoot might have little bit

21:21.865 --> 21:23.923
run away and were playing tricks,

21:24.083 --> 21:28.652
but you can see that, clearly.

21:34.569 --> 21:37.149
So, this emotional attachment is too much,

21:37.309 --> 21:41.199
and to emotionally, to worry about somebody, that

21:41.359 --> 21:45.877
you see, “This is my child, this is my this thing,

21:46.037 --> 21:47.713
this is this and this is that,”

21:47.873 --> 21:50.521
and all the time wasting your precious life

21:50.681 --> 21:55.812
in these things is not the way a Sahaja Yogi should live.

22:06.708 --> 22:09.058
If a Sahaja Yogi cannot become collective,

22:09.218 --> 22:12.998
then know that he is not a Sahaja Yogi.

22:19.464 --> 22:21.155
So, one has to know that

22:21.315 --> 22:25.502
this is the work of Bhairavnath within us.

22:28.866 --> 22:32.521
Another work that He gives us light in darkness is that,

22:32.681 --> 22:39.821
that He, He destroys all the bhoots within us.

22:45.985 --> 22:49.281
And all kinds of bhootish ideas

22:50.806 --> 22:55.560
and funny ideas about attachments

22:59.002 --> 23:02.332
and also the depressiveness.

23:03.987 --> 23:05.542
So, today we are, I am very happy

23:05.702 --> 23:09.442
that we are worshipping Shri Bhairava

23:09.602 --> 23:14.970
because He is very much connected with Ganesha.

23:20.858 --> 23:24.360
As you know Shri Ganesha is at the Mooladhara

23:24.520 --> 23:28.629
and while Bhairava moves onto the left side

23:28.789 --> 23:32.813
and goes to the right side.

23:39.317 --> 23:43.725
So, all kinds of conditionings, all kinds of habits,

23:43.885 --> 23:50.578
can be conquered through the help of Bhairavnath.

23:58.168 --> 24:03.305
In Nepal we have a very huge, big Bhairavnath statue

24:03.465 --> 24:07.366
which is really Swayambhu.

24:11.129 --> 24:13.644
And people are more left-sided,

24:13.804 --> 24:17.370
so they are afraid of Bhairavnath.

24:21.449 --> 24:25.334
So, if somebody has a bad habit, say, of stealing,

24:25.494 --> 24:28.201
they take him to the, to in front of Bhairavnath

24:28.361 --> 24:33.746
and put His light there, make a flame.

24:42.670 --> 24:44.578
I mean, the police takes them,

24:44.691 --> 24:51.070
and then they ask them, "Now, say before Bhairavnath, confess it."

24:56.393 --> 25:01.459
And they confess what wrong they have done.

25:01.619 --> 25:11.311
So, He protect us, also from doing wrong things,

25:11.418 --> 25:14.972
sly things like thieving.

25:22.445 --> 25:25.507
Whatever we think we can do secretly, can be hidden,

25:25.667 --> 25:29.900
but you cannot hide it from Bhairavnath.

25:36.232 --> 25:41.310
If you don't change, then He exposes you completely.

25:43.974 --> 25:49.858
That's how He has exposed  all the horrible false gurus.

25:53.667 --> 25:57.779
So, today we are here to worship

25:57.939 --> 26:00.381
this great Deity of Bhiaravnatha

26:00.541 --> 26:05.114
who incarnated on this earth later on,

26:13.073 --> 26:16.581
ultimately as Mahavira also.

26:17.715 --> 26:22.473
So, He stands on the gate of hell

26:25.418 --> 26:29.519
and stops people from falling into hell.

26:34.042 --> 26:36.441
But if you want to go to hell,

26:36.601 --> 26:39.729
if it is your desire, is your willpower like that working,

26:39.889 --> 26:41.436
that I should go to hell,then He says,

26:41.596 --> 26:45.485
‘All right, you can go.’

26:51.726 --> 26:58.196
But as you know, now the hell is also full of people,

27:02.015 --> 27:08.097
so is better that we should try to fight our negativity

27:08.257 --> 27:15.161
and become fun-loving, enjoying others, loving others,

27:27.610 --> 27:31.482
not worrying about what others are doing to you,

27:31.642 --> 27:36.906
but only thinking what good you can do to others.

27:45.936 --> 27:53.388
So today's special Puja for Bhairavnath we offer,

27:56.421 --> 28:03.551
to give us a sense to laugh, to enjoy, to have fun.

28:12.109 --> 28:15.679
May God bless you all.
