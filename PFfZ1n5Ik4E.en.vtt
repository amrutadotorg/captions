00:00:00.841 --> 00:00:06.080
So, today, I called this meeting because,

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.520
which is a big announcement&nbsp;
of Gregoire getting married.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.800
And he’s been very sweet to his bride.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.440
I liked it.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.040
He was very gentle and nice

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.160
and really took it in the proper sense.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.040
And Rajesh also came with his ‘fiance’.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.640
He is getting married on the 12th.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.920
And then another thing is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.440
about how to develop England and Europe together.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:01:00.000
In England, a very substantial&nbsp;
force is there, no doubt.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.480
But we have to think about how to propagate.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.960
Now I have thought of one or two things which&nbsp;
are lacking in Sahaja Yoga in here, I think.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.120
One of them is we have no publicity done.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.760
We have not been able to get people for publicity.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.400
Now this Times fellow; before I leave,&nbsp;
we have to do something about it.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.320
You can take it and note it&nbsp;
down, it would be better.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.520
Note it.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.555
[Sahaja Yogis talking]

00:01:40.555 --> 00:01:45.280
[Unclear] it is better be written&nbsp;
down some points, will be better.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.000
Behind Me, paper and pencil, you take it.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.320
[Sahaja Yogis talking]

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.600
So what is that to tape in here?

00:01:49.600 --> 00:02:04.240
It’s better to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:13.456
write it down, in short.

00:02:13.456 --> 00:02:20.320
Agnya? All&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.640
right.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.531
Everybody is catching Left Agnya.

00:02:21.531 --> 00:02:22.800
Look at her, with the hands she is trying to…

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.840
I mean cover her feet or if&nbsp;
you have socks, it’s better.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.040
It is getting blue with that.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.920
Hmm…it’s cold.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.280
So, first this gentleman, what was his name,

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.960
was ‘Mascareness’ or whatever&nbsp;
it was, to be contacted.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:54.320
And there is a doctor in Geneva&nbsp;
who has taken lot of interest.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.320
His name is Dr. Masca.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.000
In his presence, I cured about 5 people.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.200
So, he said that he didn’t&nbsp;
deliberate in My presence.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.640
I said, “All right “.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.720
And he is going to study those things.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.000
So, you tell Gregoire to get after him

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.840
that he goes and sees these people.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.080
And they should try to convince&nbsp;
the people whom I’ve cured,

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.960
that by giving something in writing,

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.200
they will be helping other people&nbsp;
to get cured of Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.080
You see, this is the only way we can&nbsp;
really approach these gross people.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.440
So, he is going to give an&nbsp;
article starting with this,

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.720
that he saw this miracle.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.080
Then he saw the raising of the Kundalini.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.766
He saw the – I mean the kind of an&nbsp;
article you would like to publish.

00:03:59.766 --> 00:03:59.828
You should give him a little&nbsp;
lead to Gregoire, on these lines.

00:03:59.828 --> 00:04:04.400
You have to prepare on what lines&nbsp;
we are going to publish the thing.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.120
We have, of course, concrete&nbsp;
examples you can give,

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.320
he being a doctor, you see.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.880
It will have an effect and that&nbsp;
we should publish it in England,

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.280
because he was also practicing here.

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.520
He has a house in this merrily&nbsp;
ground road or somewhere.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.880
So, we can publish in his name.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.640
So one of the advantages would be,

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.200
that he being a sort of an authorized person,

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.680
you can publish this article&nbsp;
about Sahaja Yoga in his name.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.320
And we can contact Mr. Mascar.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.440
Then, in case we are successful, we can&nbsp;
have a press conference or something,

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.680
before I leave, if possible.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.251
Or when I come back, one of them

00:04:55.251 --> 00:05:01.920
and we have to work it out in such a way, that&nbsp;
we also have a press conference, later on.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:13.680
For publicity, you see, what we have found&nbsp;
that this poster business works out wonders.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.640
So, when I come back, we have to&nbsp;
think on those lines of posters.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.400
And we can get very good posters&nbsp;
done in India, if you want,

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.200
and can get them by the ship.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.600
But if they arrive after&nbsp;
four years, don’t blame Me.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:35.920
[Laughter]

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.640
Find out all the methods by which you can publish.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.920
Now, Gregoire’s book, we&nbsp;
can take to some publisher

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:52.240
and ask him if he would like to publish.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.160
Then what about Don’s book?

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.920
That has to be ready before I leave,

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:05.840
so we’ll get it published in India.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.040
[Shri Mataji chuckles]

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.360
Yes, so what’s happening now?

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.680
The little dolly baby?

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.440
She knows her Mother.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.726
She knows her Mother very well.

00:06:21.726 --> 00:06:25.120
So, when we have,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.720
I mean, we should all sit down

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:33.120
and find out how we can publish about&nbsp;
or sort of advertise about Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.840
You see, because even ordinary thing&nbsp;
like punk crop or something, you know,

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.280
that goes into the eyes of these people,&nbsp;
because they create a controversy.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:57.600
Now, you can start a lecture&nbsp;
CDs on the false gurus.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.440
You people can go ahead with it.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.640
You can go on talking about ‘this false guru&nbsp;
is like this’, ‘that false guru is like this’

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.360
and nowadays another thing&nbsp;
they started is ‘magnetism’.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.360
They put a magnetism and with&nbsp;
the photograph of the guru.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.840
And they turn the magnet in&nbsp;
a different way, you see,

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.320
and then the bhoot comes in.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.360
I mean so many ways they will use, I don’t know,

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.120
but this is one of the latest I have seen.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.240
So, you see all this.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.400
And there is another thing is that, they get the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.680
photographs of the terrestrial&nbsp;
or some sort of a being, you see,

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:39.120
out of which, most surprising, the&nbsp;
God who is on this earth had my eyes,

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.080
and as if the photograph is taken from here.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:46.320
So, the nose is like that&nbsp;
and there is a mike in front.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.240
I don’t know from where they got this idea!

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:51.840
The lady showed Me.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:55.280
I said, “You’d better write&nbsp;
to them. They can find out”.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.840
I mean, look at to what point they are!

00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.840
This is so subtle.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:06.400
Now, so, for this, I could say&nbsp;
that Peter, he has to go around.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:13.520
So, I will first give you the way it&nbsp;
should be done is you write to Marie.

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.320
She wants to go there, Marie.

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:22.640
In Switzerland, everybody wants to know about TM.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.720
And they said they can arrange lectures for you.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:30.320
But there is one doctor in Germany,&nbsp;
who is very anxious to meet you.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:35.600
He is the head, sort of a head&nbsp;
in [unclear] or someplace.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:36.570
Sahaja Yogi: Really?

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:37.440
Shri Mataji: Yes.

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.480
This doctor, his name I forgot.

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:46.560
And he says, “No, no there are&nbsp;
20 names and this and that”.

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.440
But I told you.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.840
But he has got his Realization surprisingly,

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:54.508
despite the head of a nonsense. I tell you.

00:08:54.508 --> 00:08:58.638
It’s so gracious, Sahaja Yoga is&nbsp;
so gracious with people actually.

00:08:58.638 --> 00:08:59.974
[Shri Mataji chuckles]

00:08:59.975 --> 00:09:03.619
Such a man like that, who has&nbsp;
been in Sahaja Yoga for years.

00:09:03.619 --> 00:09:06.777
Ten years or so. He is the&nbsp;
head of that thing there.

00:09:06.778 --> 00:09:06.960
He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.080
got Realization all right.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.360
Sahaja Yogi: Mother, you can’t remember his name?

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:13.120
Shri Mataji: So, I’ve forgotten.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.920
But they will all write to –&nbsp;
Gregoire is going to write to you.

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.160
Thomas. Thomas was so sweet.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:23.520
His wife was, ‘wife’ means his friend,&nbsp;
was quite opposing Sahaja Yoga,

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:29.120
and, but still he organized on his&nbsp;
own and very, very sweet he was.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:33.520
And I mean, he didn’t have much&nbsp;
money but still we arranged all that.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:37.120
Bbut the rest of it was so sweet he did.

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:40.400
And, very sensible. He is a very good man.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:44.320
And another was, another&nbsp;
was Jack, you remember Jack?

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:50.000
The one who came with his wife,&nbsp;
who would not give her name.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:50.441
But this girl from Sydney did not meet Me.

00:09:50.441 --> 00:09:50.469
(Sahaja Yogi talking).

00:09:50.469 --> 00:10:00.156
Huh? Oh! That’s it! Carrie.

00:10:00.156 --> 00:10:04.720
Sahaja Yogi: Another Carrie”.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.067
Shri Mataji: Yeah. Australia is doing very well.

00:10:07.067 --> 00:10:09.280
Everyday I get a letter from there saying that,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.240
“I’ve got Realization, I’ve got Realization,”

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:16.563
and it’s a very good way because you see they&nbsp;
are writing about what is happening to this.

00:10:16.563 --> 00:10:18.240
So we have in writing, everything.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:24.720
Now, this is very important is to go down there.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.080
And, one day I’ll sit down with you and tell you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.960
what are the points to be&nbsp;
covered with these people.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.680
They can’t believe it! They can’t believe it!

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:39.280
They are so brain-washed,&nbsp;
they can’t just believe it.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:44.560
And they said, you see all the head is&nbsp;
divided into sixteen parts, I tell you.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:49.280
Horrible Agnya and they don’t want to believe it!

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:53.680
They said, “No it is doing good to us, it has&nbsp;
done good to so many people,” and this and that.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.040
I really, I can’t imagine!

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.320
But I said there is somebody like&nbsp;
this will come and talk to you.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.200
They have taken your name, but&nbsp;
I wish I had not given the name,

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.360
because then they will ring up the main head

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.760
and there they might tell&nbsp;
them that some (brain wave?).

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.840
But in any case you must go and see this man.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:14.960
And then we got two other TM people&nbsp;
there, who came to the program,

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.760
of whom Thomas was rather worried,&nbsp;
because he was also in TM.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:24.640
But when these two people came in, they&nbsp;
told Me that he is a devil incarnate.

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:25.520
I said all right.

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.840
So, there it started working out.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.920
You see then, Thomas got back his confidence also.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:35.920
So, the whole thing turned out very well.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.840
I think so, there was something.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:46.957
[Sahaja yogi talking: blue suits and red tie and…]

00:11:46.957 --> 00:11:48.040
[NOT CLEAR]

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:54.240
Blue suit was not there, but&nbsp;
something he was little elegantly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.840
dressed I should say,

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.240
quite nicely dressed.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:03.440
But not exactly blue suits,&nbsp;
but elegantly dressed people.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.000
May be they might be Initiator for [NOT CLEAR]

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.400
but they said that he was&nbsp;
the incarnation of devil.

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.760
They had no doubts.

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:14.080
So, this is what, so now you have to work it out.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:18.080
Now Spain people, out of only their phone numbers,

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.280
I will get their addresses.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:20.480
And Portugal.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.920
All these things are to be looked after.

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:27.680
Portugal, Spain, France, Nice.

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:31.200
Nice, we’ve got a very good center in Nice.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.400
But now, I think Marie is looking after,

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.520
Marie has been really spending&nbsp;
lot of money, she did a lot.

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:38.960
She did a lot, I must say.

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:44.640
And, she is going to look after Nice.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:47.120
But still you should find out&nbsp;
about it, what’s happening.

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:53.040
So, we’ve got Portugal, then&nbsp;
we’ve got Spain, Madrid,

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.800
then we’ve got Nice.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.760
And the addresses of all these&nbsp;
people should be brought in.

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.280
Today I’ll give you the&nbsp;
addresses of California people.

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:07.520
Addresses of California is coming.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.360
So, Pradhan may be coming here.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.600
Then what else?

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.520
Then we’ve got Paris, Lille.

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.080
Write it down all these places: Lille, Paris.

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:33.840
Then, I went to Geneva, then Lausanne,

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:44.105
then where did I go next to that? Zurich, Bern.

00:13:44.105 --> 00:13:53.060
Bern, Bern, Zurich and then Basel. Basel.

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:58.739
And then to this Freiburg.

00:13:58.739 --> 00:14:08.568
Freiburg, where our Rustom has done some job.

00:14:08.567 --> 00:14:14.246
How are you? How is Mr.(?)

00:14:14.246 --> 00:14:19.706
I don’t see him at all.

00:14:19.706 --> 00:14:24.293
[Sahaja Yogi talking]

00:14:24.293 --> 00:14:28.880
He is all right now?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:29.840
Upset?

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.480
So then, what did I say?

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:37.960
Then Bonn, Freiburg, then Bonn.

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:41.120
But you have to immediately write to Thomas,

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:43.920
find out from him what is he doing about it.

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:46.960
He wants somebody to go to Bonn, Freiburg.

00:14:46.960 --> 00:15:02.000
So we have to arrange all these things, you see.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.800
There is one lady who is&nbsp;
going to Nigeria form there.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.680
She might work out it.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:13.520
So, get the list of people. All the list&nbsp;
of these people and their addresses.

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:18.400
Portugal, I don’t know if you have&nbsp;
written to them, Portugal people.

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:18.960
What have you?

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.400
[Sahaja Yogini talking]

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:24.800
But you wrote?

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.941
[Sahaja Yogini talking]

00:15:26.941 --> 00:15:29.920
They sent a letter to this girl.

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:31.120
They have sent her a letter.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:36.000
So better, write to her also so that&nbsp;
form a complete circuit with them.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:44.640
So, this is the she is unhappy about something&nbsp;
is to be put on the other side I think .

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:46.400
She is on one side she has been too much.

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:53.840
Little move her to this side.

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:03.360
So, now for England.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:10.760
Our great poet Blake has already…

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:14.731
Did you read that Blake’s thing?

00:16:14.731 --> 00:16:17.534
Wonderful! Just imagine!

00:16:17.534 --> 00:16:19.520
What a prophecy!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.840
What a prophecy!

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:28.280
So correct – and foundation so laid.

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:35.040
See actually, he is seeing, just imagine&nbsp;
how great they are in the laws of divine!

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:39.440
You see that he prophesized, but for other people,

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:45.440
you people don’t understand the value&nbsp;
of all these things that you’re doing.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:49.040
And we should see the&nbsp;
profoundness of the whole thing –

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:53.200
how profound it is, how we are&nbsp;
handling the whole situation ourselves,

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:58.160
I mean you are not understanding and&nbsp;
realizing how deep it is and what it means.

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:03.840
We are taking it still in a stride I think.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:09.360
Imagine him to write all these things&nbsp;
and all the prophecies he has made,

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:14.480
now at least that will give I think&nbsp;
some boost to London Sahaja Yogis.

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:14.800
How? That they will realize their importance

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:15.265
and that what important, I mean&nbsp;
Jerusalem means the pilgrimages.

00:17:15.265 --> 00:17:29.840
That means Jerusalem is now going to shift&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:32.140
from there to here.

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:33.200
So what a great thing!

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.320
Great prophet. He was a prophet.

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.560
You see, I picked him out.

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:44.880
Gavin, you remember? I went to see all his works.

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:47.760
I mean, I picked him out. I didn’t&nbsp;
know all this that he has done it.

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.720
I didn’t know about this&nbsp;
poem also this Jerusalem one.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:59.520
And I think Warren has given Me one book but&nbsp;
I read a little bit here and there not much.

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:00.720
But I’m now going to read all that.

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.720
Look at him. What a poet you had.

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.320
Prophet, a real prophet he was.

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:08.560
What a prophecy!

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:13.680
He might be [NOT CLEAR].

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:16.720
So precise. So precise, imagine!

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:21.040
And beautifully described!&nbsp;
Really beautifully described.

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:23.680
This is, who has done this?

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.160
Jeremy has found out, is it?

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:34.560
Sahaja yogi talking: Jeremy and then .[NOT&nbsp;
CLEAR] and then Jeremy found this thing.

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:41.840
Shri Mataji: One has to go into his works&nbsp;
to find out what he has prophesized more.

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:52.797
Sahaja Yogi: He got the whole, complete&nbsp;
and also he got the complete work…

00:18:52.797 --> 00:18:55.680
Shri Mataji: Great!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:56.480
Jerusalem.

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:07.360
All right. So now for&nbsp;
Jerusalem, what is to be done?

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.840
That we have to find out.

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:18.240
That is to be little bit worked&nbsp;
out in various methods, you see?

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:20.880
Gregoire has certain ideas.

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:29.280
He said that we should materially&nbsp;
improve ourselves first of all.

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:34.560
Little bit. For presentation&nbsp;
it’s important he said that.

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:38.640
Gregoire, you see, he is very practical.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:45.200
He said, the presentation&nbsp;
should be, if not blue suits

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:49.360
at least there should be some proper&nbsp;
English suits, that should be worn

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:53.360
because an Englishman like a&nbsp;
hippy won’t be accepted anywhere.

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.640
An Englishman to be dressed&nbsp;
up properly is important.

00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:01.600
So, that is something you&nbsp;
find out what thing proper is.

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:07.360
But need not be absolutely one-color&nbsp;
stuff but everybody should try to.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.520
For presentation, when you go to&nbsp;
a, say, a meeting or something,

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:26.400
it should appear that it belonged to old,&nbsp;
old style English traditional person.

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:28.560
See, so people take you seriously,

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:32.160
which was Gregoire’s very good idea&nbsp;
because for all these functions,

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:37.360
he told all the people in Switzerland&nbsp;
that they must dressup properly.

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:42.880
And then how to behave in a program and&nbsp;
all that, he is very particular you see?

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:47.280
For a newcomer, as he said&nbsp;
to Me that for a newcomer,

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:49.040
what matters is your outside.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:53.600
They don’t know about your inside&nbsp;
and how you behave and all that.

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:54.640
He said that, “Mother you make a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:03.040
little outline for that and discuss&nbsp;
with all the London people also.”

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:10.720
How to work out the outside&nbsp;
behavior of Sahaja Yogis

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:16.320
when they go to a meeting or hold&nbsp;
a meeting or work it out in a way.

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:20.080
Because it should look like one&nbsp;
group and working out together.

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:23.760
One group is the main point is, you see?

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:29.840
And everybody should support each&nbsp;
other in the presence of others.

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:31.920
See otherwise it looks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:42.000
as if some blind people are&nbsp;
trying to lead other blind.

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:46.160
It should appear that you&nbsp;
people have achieved something

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.640
and that you are all in one tune with each other

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:55.520
or there is no quarrel between&nbsp;
you and there is no indignity.

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:58.320
Because if others, when&nbsp;
they see you in this manner,

00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:59.600
they get frightened and they run away.

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:02.880
So, he said that for that I&nbsp;
have to make some outline,

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:07.440
but I would like to have suggestions&nbsp;
from you people and also on top of that,

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:10.480
I hope you’ll make it ready by this week.

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:16.000
All of you to give Me suggestions as&nbsp;
to what sort of things we should have,

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.240
which will look presentable to people.

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:24.160
Like you see, they expect&nbsp;
something of an Englishman

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:28.640
and if that is not there, then they tell,&nbsp;
“These are some of the craps,” you see.

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:35.280
So, Gregoire’s idea was correct&nbsp;
that they should appear in this way

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:41.200
and I think you should think&nbsp;
over it. What should be done for.

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:46.640
And secondly, we have to find out,&nbsp;
see the places where I visited

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:54.320
and try to allocate places to every Sahaja yogi,

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:56.560
who would like to look at those places.

00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:00.000
Now what happens to people who come and go away?

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:08.000
What is the reason? You should&nbsp;
find out. Go and talk to them.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.280
You must make a study of that.

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:11.920
Why do they come to Sahaja&nbsp;
Yoga and then disappear?

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:18.960
One of the reasons, as these people discussed&nbsp;
was this, that, people are very naive.

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:22.240
They don’t know what to expect.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:25.600
So, Don’s book is also after realization, you see?

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:28.880
There should be a small&nbsp;
introduction of Sahaja Yoga&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:34.560
according to them

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:38.640
a small little introduction to Sahaja&nbsp;
Yoga, what to expect, what to find.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:43.040
I think, one of My speeches&nbsp;
is there which I gave you.

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:53.280
We can sit down and chart out&nbsp;
an introduction to Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:55.840
What are we to expect, you see?

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:58.480
And a very direct thing should be there.

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:04.480
And, I mean for advertising, say for example&nbsp;
you want to have a meeting somewhere,

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:09.520
you can even have pamphlets, you can even&nbsp;
distribute and things that people can come

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:13.760
and intensively we should work out in every place.

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.080
Then it will grow faster.

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:21.200
Pune is doing very good work, Pune. Tremendous.

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:25.120
Apart from that, Bombay is doing very well.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.640
Rajesh was saying it is going&nbsp;
very well in Maharashtra.

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:33.520
But the only difference between&nbsp;
Maharashtra and other places is this:

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:35.440
that they know about it beforehand.

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:38.160
They know Kundalini, they&nbsp;
know what to expect, you see.

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.840
This is what is missing.

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:47.880
So if you can give it in writing, what to expect&nbsp;
out of Self Realization, and very directly –&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:50.960
the points.

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:56.080
First what to expect, what is&nbsp;
Self Realization? What is Self?

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:59.200
Very, very directly, you see, absolutely.

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.440
So, that anybody who wants to read can see that.

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:03.920
And then he should see that&nbsp;
what to expect and all.

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:08.960
If we can prepare something like that,

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:15.680
then you prepare a sort of&nbsp;
a, what you call a framework

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.120
and then we can fill it up.

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:22.160
But should not be complicated,&nbsp;
simple and very direct.

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:24.880
Because even Don’s book is after Realization.

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:27.440
Before Realization, that book is bit too much.

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:34.000
We can do it in small, very small way.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:42.080
There is no need to question and answer&nbsp;
sort of thing we can do it very direct.

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:45.520
Now, after Realization, people go away, you see.

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.920
Now for that also we have to understand why.

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:50.720
Why people go and what should we do to stop them?

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:55.840
Some of them whom I talked to, you see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:55.840 --> 00:26:00.880
why they went away is that some say&nbsp;
there is no love between Sahaja Yogis.

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:03.440
This is a very important point.

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.720
They do not talk to each other with love.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.317
You see this is the fellow from Rajneesh, he was,

00:26:09.317 --> 00:26:12.127
and he said in Rajneesh there is lot of love.

00:26:12.127 --> 00:26:16.123
Well, you see it is filth, you&nbsp;
know there, but doesn’t matter.

00:26:16.123 --> 00:26:21.430
To him outsider he sees everybody, you see,&nbsp;
very friendly and nice and this and that.

00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:21.680
So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:30.080
the kind of dryness and arrogance or we can say&nbsp;
fighting and all that nonsense should be avoided.

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:36.160
So, all this we have to chart it&nbsp;
out, but this is one of the reasons.

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:41.200
Secondly, they said that&nbsp;
some of the Sahaja Yogis talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:44.720
in such a manner as if they are great, you see.

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:48.800
They have achieved a lot and&nbsp;
very egoistically they talk.

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:51.840
And that repels people.

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:58.160
They should talk in a softer way.

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:01.920
That might be hinting at&nbsp;
Gregoire, maybe, I don’t know.

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:09.120
But I must say Gregoire’s&nbsp;
shouting helps other way around.

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:11.280
I mean many people become very alert.

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:18.080
But his style is different you know. So&nbsp;
everybody should not take to the same style.

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:20.880
You can have different&nbsp;
styles of approaching people.

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:27.840
It’s like Gavin and Gregoire&nbsp;
both go hand-in-hand very well.

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:30.000
I mean if they both of them approach somebody,

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.440
then the left and right both are put together.

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:38.000
Such combinations should be found out.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:44.080
You see where, the great thing is the&nbsp;
friendship of Sahaja Yogis, you see.

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:46.000
The great friendship must be developed.

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:51.840
That friendship I don’t know, should be like,

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:54.960
Ram said that Pradhan is coming&nbsp;
everybody felt very happy, you see.

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:59.840
Why? After all Pradhan is such an&nbsp;
old man, 75-year old man coming here.

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:01.680
But you feel so close to him, why?

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:04.960
Because you are born of the same Mother

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:09.200
and you are doing such a tremendous work

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:13.680
and all these fellow feelings&nbsp;
should come like a soldier fights&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:16.880
with [INAUDIBLE] others are&nbsp;
also fighting the same way.

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:19.440
But that is not there. You&nbsp;
see it is more artificial.

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:23.973
Sort of… I think that is what is… huh?

00:28:23.973 --> 00:28:28.480
Sahaja Yogi : Everyone’s attention&nbsp;
is on very petty things all the time.

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:29.976
Shri Mataji : I think so.

00:28:29.976 --> 00:28:36.000
Sahaja Yogi : There is not&nbsp;
sort of enthusiasm and fire.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:43.840
Sort of, you know, energy [NOT CLEAR] It’s&nbsp;
all whose turn is it to do this and I mean.

00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:46.373
Shri Mataji: That, that&nbsp;
should be stopped completely.

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:49.200
That’s what I was saying.

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:53.280
Why not get a maid servant for the Ashram?

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:56.058
Better get a maid and pay&nbsp;
herthan to worry about it.

00:28:56.058 --> 00:28:59.482
This is something that will pull you down so much.

00:28:59.482 --> 00:29:02.400
I tell you so much. Hopeless.

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:07.360
Sahaja Yogi: Also I think there is a tendency&nbsp;
to become a kind of hypochondriac, Mother.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:12.320
People become obsessed with their&nbsp;
catches, you know, and they sit there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:17.040
and just worrying about what catch they have&nbsp;
got and all this, and they won’t do anything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:20.640
for Sahaja yoga, you know. They just&nbsp;
worry about themselves all the time.

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:21.360
Shri Mataji: See?

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:27.120
Now, for this I’ve told Harry that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:39.840
you should not worry – now leave your&nbsp;
hand, just sit, still I will look after it.

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:43.120
You should not worry about your catches at all.

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:45.680
The more you worry, the more&nbsp;
the, they will be there.

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:49.680
Now for example, you are very subtle.

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:51.120
Gavin knows this point very well.

00:29:51.840 --> 00:30:04.255
As you were subtler and they&nbsp;
were subtler also. Very clever.

00:30:04.255 --> 00:30:04.308
They would like to come in&nbsp;
the program to disturb Me.

00:30:04.308 --> 00:30:05.360
I’ll give one of the examples.

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:16.560
That in the program, they’ll come just&nbsp;
to give a feeling that you’re unwell.

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:18.960
You start behaving like that.

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:20.960
So the other people, who are there they say,&nbsp;
see they are unwell why should we be here?

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:29.840
Then they start clearing yourself out like that.

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:35.840
See all these things go against good publicity.

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:41.506
Then their attention is on your, ‘I’m&nbsp;
catching here I’m catching there’.

00:30:41.505 --> 00:30:45.046
The more you do that, the more they will be there.

00:30:45.046 --> 00:30:48.799
It’s all not catching&nbsp;
anywhere. They will run away.

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:52.800
See, they are there just to create a&nbsp;
problem for Me and for Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:55.520 --> 00:31:01.680
So, better tell your mind that, “You get out from&nbsp;
here. We don’t want any help. Had enough of you.”

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:04.640
If you do that it will work out.

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:08.400
Or you should, best thing is to say, ‘Surrender’.

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:10.880
Surrender is the only way.

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:14.240
Anything comes, “I’ll surrender&nbsp;
myself to Mother, finished.

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:18.320
All these things will go&nbsp;
away. That’s the best way.

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:25.840
Then you start seeing [?] very clearly,&nbsp;
which I’ve been talking to Harry.

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:30.720
That he would used to worry like,&nbsp;
“Where should I put my attention?”

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:37.227
I said you just don’t worry just say, ‘I&nbsp;
surrender everything to you Mother’. Finished.

00:31:37.227 --> 00:31:41.405
Don’t try to do anything. Don’t try to take out.

00:31:41.405 --> 00:31:44.539
Just surrender. They’ll all run away.

00:31:44.539 --> 00:31:49.360
Otherwise they will be there&nbsp;
creating a nuisance out of you.

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:52.480
You see the trouble is the whole&nbsp;
society is individualistic, you see.

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:58.000
So to get out of that individualistic&nbsp;
society into a real social being,

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:03.280
in the sense that it has to be a&nbsp;
real Sahaja Yogi collective being,

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:07.840
then one has to remember not to&nbsp;
pay any attention to yourself.

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:10.393
What is so important? [NOT CLEAR] who am I?

00:32:10.393 --> 00:32:20.720
Sahaja Yogi: This is what I’ve been saying on&nbsp;
Friday night.. It tends to be that people come in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:24.800
and they just think about themselves and they work&nbsp;
on themselves without going to someone and saying,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:28.480
‘Can I help you? Can I do this for you?’

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:34.880
Shri Mataji: No, No. That is also another subtler&nbsp;
work is that I’ll help you. I’ll do this for you.

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:38.560
Because this is again the missionary part of it.

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:41.840
I must tell you because&nbsp;
Christians should be aware of it.

00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:50.800
What these missionary business of&nbsp;
helping you. Whom are you helping?

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:55.840
You are helping yourself.

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:58.880
The more you are with others, the&nbsp;
more you are enjoying yourself.

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:01.520
Sahaja Yogi : Being collective.

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:05.638
Shri Mataji: Just be collective.

00:33:05.638 --> 00:33:10.532
Just do it because you like it, you love it

00:33:10.533 --> 00:33:12.167
and by which you are the winner not the other.

00:33:12.167 --> 00:33:14.086
You are the ones who are&nbsp;
going to gain not the others.

00:33:14.086 --> 00:33:16.076
The more you [you will do&nbsp;
it?] the more you [will gain?]

00:33:16.075 --> 00:33:17.638
But, [it’s becoming?] subtler and subtler.

00:33:17.639 --> 00:33:20.091
Like one would say that I am doing&nbsp;
it because I become more powerful.

00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:22.257
What am I? Because after all&nbsp;
ascent is the point, isn’t it?

00:33:22.258 --> 00:33:22.400
You&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:25.796
have to ascend.

00:33:25.796 --> 00:33:41.049
How far you have ascended in Sahaja yoga,&nbsp;
how far your vibrations are alright,

00:33:41.049 --> 00:33:50.240
how far you have gone deeper is the main point.

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:54.720
And that can only be achieved, only be&nbsp;
achieved through surrender, nothing else.

00:33:54.720 --> 00:34:05.840
Nothing else. Before and after.

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:07.283
Putting your attention, complete surrender.

00:34:07.282 --> 00:34:07.919
That will work out.

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:11.520
That will absolutely neutralize all&nbsp;
these things [UNCLEAR hypochondriac …?]

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:16.560
just put all the troubles onto Me.

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:17.731
Even to this point [INAUDIBLE] like he, Harry,

00:34:17.731 --> 00:34:23.791
I’ve been studying you&nbsp;
people through him very well.

00:34:23.791 --> 00:34:28.640
That, just now I talked to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:33.200
Harry and I told him that&nbsp;
how subtle it becomes that,

00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:36.320
he’s a very nice person, good-hearted, everything.

00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:38.160
But the bhooths are not.

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:44.400
So, today I talked to Maharaj,&nbsp;
this fellow from Africa.

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:51.520
And in his talk, I discovered, he&nbsp;
said, I was talking about a doctor,

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:55.040
and he told Me a sentence,&nbsp;
“Mother, he is judging you”.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.920
And that’s how he got hot and I said, “That’s it.”

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:08.240
Anything that judges Me is wrong, like,&nbsp;
“She’s doing this because She loves us.”

00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:16.577
Even this point. Who are you?

00:35:16.577 --> 00:35:19.834
You see the subtleness, the&nbsp;
subtle point behind this.

00:35:19.834 --> 00:35:22.353
Can you see it? That’s what I told him.

00:35:22.353 --> 00:35:24.688
See Hanumana gets angry on this point.

00:35:24.688 --> 00:35:26.961
Hanumana, absolutely hundred percent.

00:35:26.961 --> 00:35:27.760
Who are you?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:28.581
Why should She love you?

00:35:28.581 --> 00:35:35.373
And because She loves us that’s why you&nbsp;
must accept what am I saying to you.

00:35:35.373 --> 00:35:40.560
What’s that?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:43.840
Hello?

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:47.786
Just open the door. Who else has come?

00:35:47.786 --> 00:35:50.174
[Sahaja Yogini talking]

00:35:50.174 --> 00:35:55.262
Hello your friend is coming is it? Who is coming?

00:35:55.263 --> 00:35:58.171
She is trying to talk to Me.

00:35:58.171 --> 00:36:04.298
She doesn’t like when I don’t&nbsp;
pay any attention to her.

00:36:04.298 --> 00:36:05.440
All right.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:08.160
Hello. How are you?

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:13.334
It is nice to see you. Sit down. Sit down.

00:36:13.334 --> 00:36:17.120
So, how it becomes subtler&nbsp;
and subtler, one should see.

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:19.520
And one should face it.

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:51.680
And when the subtle ways, I must&nbsp;
say there is a difference between&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:54.804
the senior Sahaja Yogis and this thing.

00:36:54.804 --> 00:36:56.663
You just see this. There is&nbsp;
a understanding, there is.

00:36:56.663 --> 00:36:58.694
Anything should be done from&nbsp;
the Sahaja Yoga point of view.

00:36:58.694 --> 00:36:59.865
Are we helping Sahaja Yoga or not.

00:36:59.865 --> 00:37:00.967
I think maturity comes with age.

00:37:00.967 --> 00:37:02.138
The concern should be Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:02.137 --> 00:37:03.962
And even if you, I mean I&nbsp;
said you must take up jobs.

00:37:03.962 --> 00:37:04.926
You must earn. Have to work.

00:37:04.926 --> 00:37:06.406
You have to improve your styles and things.

00:37:06.407 --> 00:37:07.440
Somewhat, but for Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:09.200
It’s to be done for Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:15.360
That’s not the aim. Aim is Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:16.560
That’s the main point is.

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:20.720
That Sahaja Yoga should be&nbsp;
placed as the highest thing

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:29.093
and then only it will work out, because&nbsp;
all these subtle things will disappear.

00:37:29.093 --> 00:37:33.120
Otherwise these subtle things swallow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:33.130
you.

00:37:33.130 --> 00:37:33.428
And they come as [UNCLEAR], you see,&nbsp;
and they will give you ideas and things

00:37:33.428 --> 00:37:34.640
and it will start losing sight of it,

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:38.480
because you must know that you have&nbsp;
been prophesized long time back.

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:42.400
And you are doing such a tremendous work.

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:47.200
It’s such a great work you are doing.

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:50.960
I wish you could realize it, because&nbsp;
even that understanding is very subtle.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.240
Then all other things you just throw away.

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:06.880
That Sahaja Yoga itself is self-established&nbsp;
and have this self-esteem thing.

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:08.160
It does not need from you.

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:13.760
Only thing by taking it up yourself,&nbsp;
you improve in your status.

00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:17.840
Like that. Now see you understand.

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:23.600
You’re doing no favor to Sahaja&nbsp;
Yoga or to Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:25.280
You’re doing favor to yourself.

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:27.680
Now, this point is the point I tell you.

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:31.840
All right? So you surrender.

00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:37.360
Surrendering is the only&nbsp;
way. There is no other way.

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:39.680
And that’s why these problems can be solved now.

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:45.840
So how do we do it?

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:48.999
May God bless you.

00:38:48.999 --> 00:38:56.720
Oh, God! Good, good, come along, come along.

00:38:56.720 --> 00:39:00.317
How are you? Good.

00:39:00.317 --> 00:39:03.561
Who else is coming from Cambridge?

00:39:03.561 --> 00:39:06.805
Sahaja Yogi: I’m from Australia.

00:39:06.805 --> 00:39:11.290
Sahaja Yogi: [Unclear]. He stays in the ashram.

00:39:11.290 --> 00:39:13.580
Shri Mataji: Come along.

00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:18.160
John will be coming. Dalla [unsure] would come,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:27.840
I’m sure.

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:28.878
Sahaja Yogi: [Unclear].

00:39:28.878 --> 00:39:30.187
Shri Mataji: Not yet arrived.

00:39:30.188 --> 00:39:31.588
Sahaja Yogi: I know. [Unclear].

00:39:31.587 --> 00:39:33.040
Shri Mataji: Hmm. How to do it?

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:38.122
“By not doing it”, he said, “by surrender”.

00:39:38.122 --> 00:39:48.400
Sahaja Yogi: I’ll miss Mother that; It&nbsp;
will then have a tendency to seat and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:51.520
there’ll be a big mess and there is&nbsp;
no point in doing anything, because-

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:52.772
[Laughter]

00:39:52.772 --> 00:39:58.150
Shri Mataji: Then you do everything.&nbsp;
You see, when you become dynamic.

00:39:58.150 --> 00:40:02.800
If you are not becoming dynamic,&nbsp;
that means you are a gone case.

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:10.928
This is the judgment point.

00:40:10.928 --> 00:40:13.963
Sahaja Yogi: We are all gone&nbsp;
cases here then, Mother.

00:40:13.963 --> 00:40:14.536
[Laughter]

00:40:14.536 --> 00:40:16.941
Shri Mataji: No. You can’t say that now.

00:40:16.941 --> 00:40:19.575
Sahaja Yogi: In fact, what we should be doing?

00:40:19.575 --> 00:40:21.866
Another Sahaja Yogi: Let it be as it is.

00:40:21.865 --> 00:40:24.499
Shri Mataji: You think so? I don’t think so.

00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:26.848
I’ve been praising you people all over.

00:40:26.848 --> 00:40:29.310
Of course, sometimes I used to get frantic.

00:40:29.310 --> 00:40:33.548
I must say the people in this country,&nbsp;
have only one problem, is lethargy.

00:40:33.548 --> 00:40:35.151
I will say, get active also.

00:40:35.151 --> 00:40:36.640
They can be only bathroom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:37.360
cleaners.

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:38.240
This is the problem.

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:45.440
So, the inactivity can be dangerous.

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:48.160
But I’m saying of non-action.

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:49.760
I’m not saying of inactivity,

00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:53.120
where the feeling that, “I’m&nbsp;
doing something” is not there.

00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:01.380
We have to be active, extremely active,&nbsp;
but say, “I’m not doing it “. Surrendered.

00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:01.634
If you are lethargic, then you are no good.

00:41:01.634 --> 00:41:01.983
I mean you are absolutely&nbsp;
wrong, ‘tamasik’, left-sided.

00:41:01.983 --> 00:41:02.880
Well, if you are active and you&nbsp;
know that, “It’s all surrendered,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:22.960
I’m not doing it “.

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:28.400
Then inactivity is not non-action.

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:29.960
Non-action is very different.

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:32.170
Like the sun comes and gives&nbsp;
you light. It just emits.

00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:44.320
It is non-action. It doesn’t say, “I’m doing it “.

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:46.240
You see the difference between the two.

00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:47.840
It should be clearly understood.

00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:52.560
Sahaja Yogi: Do you think, Mother,&nbsp;
that sometimes there is a tendency&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:58.320
to feel that if you do something&nbsp;
in an active way, that you may&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:04.080
get a catch in the left or right heart. Then&nbsp;
there’s a sense, there is a tendency then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:10.000
not to do anything, since we go closer of your –&nbsp;
you that you might go catching or doing something.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.763
Another Sahaja Yogi: It’s hypochondriac thing.

00:42:11.763 --> 00:42:13.600
Sahaja Yogi: And that’s the hypochondria.

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:17.573
Another Sahaja Yogi: I’m catching on left&nbsp;
heart, so I can’t do anything… the whole day.

00:42:17.573 --> 00:42:21.582
Shri Mataji: I mean, Sahaja&nbsp;
Yoga is not for such cowards.

00:42:21.582 --> 00:42:22.480
They are useless, they better get out.

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:29.876
You see, it’s meant for people who are&nbsp;
real warriors, you see, we need soldiers.

00:42:29.876 --> 00:42:33.521
Sahaja Yogi : We must fight now.&nbsp;
We got to get out and fight.

00:42:33.521 --> 00:42:39.018
Shri Mataji: They will go out of circulation,&nbsp;
don’t you worry, all such people, very soon.

00:42:39.018 --> 00:42:42.901
So, those who are afraid of&nbsp;
catching, they go out of circulation.

00:42:42.901 --> 00:42:43.200
Here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:46.560
we are not here to look after your chakras.

00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:52.400
We are here to work for Sahaja Yoga.

00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:58.880
When you start working for Sahaja Yoga,&nbsp;
you are automatically cured and geared up.

00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:00.800
That’s what it is.

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:05.120
Sahaja Yogi: Donna said something very&nbsp;
appropriate when we were talking. She said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:07.400
“One just has to look at the little ones.”

00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:11.840
Shri Mataji: Yes.

00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:15.599
She is working for all of&nbsp;
you left, right everywhere.

00:43:15.599 --> 00:43:17.372
[Shri Mataji is laughing]

00:43:17.372 --> 00:43:20.847
That’s a game. That’s a game she’s playing.

00:43:20.847 --> 00:43:24.038
The game we are all in like you, smiling too.

00:43:24.038 --> 00:43:24.960
Sahaja Yogi:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:28.640
This is what we must realize&nbsp;
that they work very hard.

00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:32.720
Shri Mataji: That’s true!&nbsp;
Extremely, extremely hard.

00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:37.151
And they scream and shout and everything.

00:43:37.151 --> 00:43:40.960
Sahaja Yogi: Cause it is quite obvious that&nbsp;
when someone comes in, who’s got a bad catch,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:48.540
because the working-out starts&nbsp;
immediately because of things.

00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:49.418
Shri Mataji: What things?

00:43:49.418 --> 00:43:53.840
Better you learn from them.

00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:57.036
I should be the one, who is catching the most.

00:43:57.036 --> 00:43:58.773
[Shri Mataji is laughing]

00:43:58.774 --> 00:44:00.094
Yes! What happened?

00:44:00.094 --> 00:44:01.831
Sahaja Yogi: Nothing bad.

00:44:01.831 --> 00:44:03.360
Shri Mataji: There we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:07.840
have.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:21.840
Humm.

00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:30.995
Maybe that is, I don’t know. You see, it’s a&nbsp;
mathematics, which cannot be calculated easily.

00:44:30.994 --> 00:44:33.760
It’s the thing you go five&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:34.635
steps forward, three steps backwards,

00:44:34.635 --> 00:44:35.840
eight steps forward, four steps backwards.

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:38.880
Ten steps forward, eleven steps backwards.

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:38.956
And where do you reach? What is the speed?

00:44:38.956 --> 00:44:39.001
That’s what England is.

00:44:39.001 --> 00:44:39.046
[Shri Mataji is laughing]

00:44:39.046 --> 00:44:39.122
But everybody of the whole is progressing.

00:44:39.121 --> 00:44:39.207
No doubt, slow and steady. We’ll win the race.

00:44:39.208 --> 00:44:39.385
Sahaja Yogi: I mean a wind of change came in the&nbsp;
last week when this girl arrived from Australia.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:39.384 --> 00:44:39.535
I mean it was really, someone I never met&nbsp;
so positive and everything else like that.

00:44:39.536 --> 00:44:39.644
Shri Mataji: They are the&nbsp;
children of convicts, you see? So.

00:44:39.644 --> 00:44:39.752
So fresh! Annick, there is&nbsp;
another one. Her name was Annick.

00:44:39.752 --> 00:44:39.857
She met us in Orleans. She&nbsp;
came all the way to meet Marie.

00:44:39.857 --> 00:44:39.891
Ah, you were there.

00:44:39.891 --> 00:44:39.963
She went round and took all the posters.

00:44:39.963 --> 00:44:40.051
You see Marie, as usual, brought up from England.

00:44:40.051 --> 00:44:40.184
So, she said, “Mother, she didn’t&nbsp;
tell me beforehand. She had put the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:40.185 --> 00:44:40.311
advertisement in the paper. But,&nbsp;
she didn’t find out when it was”.

00:44:40.311 --> 00:44:40.408
So, it was on the third day&nbsp;
the advertisement stopped.

00:44:40.408 --> 00:44:40.511
And there were no advertisements&nbsp;
for the two days before.

00:44:40.511 --> 00:44:40.592
So, this Annick said, “Doesn’t matter”.

00:44:40.592 --> 00:44:40.689
She went and put posters&nbsp;
everywhere eight days before.

00:44:40.689 --> 00:44:40.736
Everybody put the posters.

00:44:40.736 --> 00:44:40.813
And on the poster only, Annick got so many.

00:44:40.813 --> 00:44:40.928
And Marie said, “Mother, I’m&nbsp;
still an intuit, I don’ know.

00:44:40.929 --> 00:44:41.052
This thing happened; the third day&nbsp;
we got all a big [unclear] crowd.

00:44:41.051 --> 00:44:41.224
But these people who came with the posters, stayed&nbsp;
on for two days and really came up very well.

00:44:41.224 --> 00:44:41.292
And then, they started working it out.

00:44:41.293 --> 00:44:41.356
Now Paris is very well established.

00:44:41.356 --> 00:44:41.498
But this is what it is and the way she,&nbsp;
I mean, tremendous she was, isn’t it?

00:44:41.498 --> 00:44:41.599
Orleans, she did it very well.&nbsp;
She is really tremendous.

00:44:41.599 --> 00:44:41.680
To her, Sahaja Yoga is her life. Absolutely.

00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:44.400
Australians are going to show&nbsp;
a way to you people, I think.

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:52.928
The convicts are born here to pull us&nbsp;
down everywhere, you go everywhere.

00:44:52.928 --> 00:44:54.808
You find those convicts, eh?

00:44:54.807 --> 00:44:55.680
Sahaja Yogi:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:55.680 --> 00:45:04.056
We need an exchange scheme.

00:45:04.056 --> 00:45:04.829
[Shri Mataji is laughing]

00:45:04.830 --> 00:45:06.508
Sahaja Yogi: We’ll send some&nbsp;
over there. No sense up here.

00:45:06.508 --> 00:45:06.700
[Shri Mataji is laughing]

00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:10.240
Shri Mataji: No, I think it is&nbsp;
alcoholism, of the worst time.

00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:16.960
Now in front of her house, we find&nbsp;
five, six of them permanently circle.

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:18.080
One of them is a lady.

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:21.680
Early in the morning, they are all drinking.

00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:27.360
And by yesterday we were, me and this&nbsp;
doctor who has come, we were going down.

00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:32.080
One of them was standing with a bottle and&nbsp;
was singing and going forward and backwards.

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:35.200
So this Indian doctor got a fright.

00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:38.400
He said, “Better go by another road,&nbsp;
because he may just shoot off”.

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:46.080
I said, “So this is what it is”.

00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:50.240
But Swiss people are very&nbsp;
speedy, very speedy people.

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:52.880
They are on the other side. They are so speedy.

00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:57.680
Means, you know, it’s like a low&nbsp;
train which never reaches the point.

00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:00.560
And the fast one which always&nbsp;
misses the station, it is like that.

00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:03.840
I don’t know which one to travel.

00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:06.233
[Shri Mataji is laughing]

00:46:06.233 --> 00:46:08.435
Sahaja Yogi: [Unclear].

00:46:08.435 --> 00:46:09.680
Shri Mataji:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:12.000
That is the situation of the West is.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:17.840
So, when you realize all this, we&nbsp;
must see and try to correct it.

00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:22.640
But only difference perhaps is that&nbsp;
difference- difference I find in this,

00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:25.708
that they understand their mistakes. And-

00:46:25.708 --> 00:46:28.960
Sahaja Yogi: It’s really the German&nbsp;
section, I think. They really.

00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:32.640
Shri Mataji: No, all of them. Swiss also.

00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:33.840
They also, they all understand.

00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:38.080
They say, “Mother, we are very speedy, we have&nbsp;
to bring down, put down my speedometer”. You see.

00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:43.520
And this is what we people do not&nbsp;
realize, that we are lethargic here.

00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:48.080
The difference is, lethargic&nbsp;
people they never realize

00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:53.600
because they don’t even have so much strength&nbsp;
to think of that, that we are lethargic.

00:46:55.280 --> 00:47:00.720
My husband’s place, Lucknow, is known&nbsp;
for all kinds of lethargic people.

00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:05.120
So, they had a competition.

00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:10.880
They got all of them in a row&nbsp;
and said, “Whosoever is the most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:15.680
lethargic, the laziest, walk one step forward”.

00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:19.200
So everybody walks one step forward.

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:24.240
But one was from England. He stayed back.

00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:27.280
So the people asked him, “Why&nbsp;
didn’t you step forward?”

00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:28.981
He said, “I don’t even want to do that”.

00:47:28.981 --> 00:47:29.008
[Laughter]

00:47:29.008 --> 00:47:41.440
It’s true that was the laziest.

00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:44.160
So that should not do the case. All right?

00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:53.760
See the working is on still, the&nbsp;
right side, right side, right side.

00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:59.520
It’s all working, yes, yes, yes,&nbsp;
yes, it’s going on all the time.

00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:05.840
Ah! It’s working. Poor things.

00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:09.600
I have seen my grandchildren also. Aradhana,

00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:12.080
she was hardly three years or so,&nbsp;
we had taken her to the airport.

00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:15.120
She said, “No, no”, like that. She&nbsp;
was going on like that, you see.

00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:18.400
So, Kalpana could not understand&nbsp;
why she was so crazy, so fast.

00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:19.840
[To other Sahaja Yogis] Hello, hello, hello!

00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:25.280
Here comes then another mister&nbsp;
[a baby boy]. Is he sleeping?

00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:25.680
Sahaja Yogini: No, no. [Unclear] Kamala

00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:32.800
Shri Mataji: Come along. Where will you sit new?

00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:33.280
Sit here.

00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:41.600
How are you now? Better? All right, I’ll see.

00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:47.840
Ah! This one has come. This one,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:56.880 --> 00:49:31.280
see. Just see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:32.640
this one.

00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:32.880
May God bless you.

00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:43.840
He’s all right. Poor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:59.200 --> 00:49:59.340
thing.

00:49:59.340 --> 00:49:59.356
[Baby screaming]

00:49:59.356 --> 00:49:59.640
May God bless.

00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:11.996
[Baby still screaming]

00:50:11.996 --> 00:50:14.182
Shri Mataji [talking to&nbsp;
baby]: What has happened? Hum?

00:50:14.182 --> 00:50:16.238
He’s catching from all of you. Poor thing.

00:50:16.239 --> 00:50:17.020
[Shri Mataji is working on the baby]

00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:17.410
May God bless you.

00:50:17.410 --> 00:50:18.213
Hot. He’s catching from all of you.

00:50:18.213 --> 00:50:26.130
She’s helping him now.

00:50:26.130 --> 00:50:28.524
Sahaja Yogi: She wants [unclear].

00:50:28.524 --> 00:50:30.337
[Shri Mataji is laughing]

00:50:30.337 --> 00:50:31.280
Shri Mataji:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:32.800
How much they work, I tell you, really.

00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:40.840
Yes, yes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:55.040
Hmm. Swadisthana.

00:50:55.040 --> 00:51:00.480
So, this is what we have to do&nbsp;
now. We have covered these points.

00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:07.840
Now about your travelling, when can you do it?

00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:12.275
Sahaja Yogi: As soon as possible.&nbsp;
I’ll write to her, if you want.

00:51:12.275 --> 00:51:16.446
Shri Mataji: Ask Thomas, first&nbsp;
of all. Will you go via Germany?

00:51:16.446 --> 00:51:18.035
Sahaja Yogi: I think so.

00:51:18.034 --> 00:51:19.557
Shri Mataji: All right.

00:51:19.557 --> 00:51:25.184
Sahaja Yogi: The van, the combi is, you know&nbsp;
that combi is, it takes very short time.

00:51:25.184 --> 00:51:30.811
Another Sahaja Yogi: Rolthar has sent a&nbsp;
thousand pounds to get the van fixed up. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:30.811 --> 00:51:33.459
it can be used for Sahaja Yoga programs.

00:51:33.459 --> 00:51:34.320
Shri Mataji:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:36.000
Really? Very sweet of him.

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:42.560
Sahaja Yogi: And if there’s myself in a&nbsp;
company, and one other person lately who can go,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:46.560
then we can stay in the van and do the&nbsp;
cooking and everything else in the van.

00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:50.240
Shri Mataji: Good idea. That’s a good idea.

00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:52.800
Can it be fixed or not? Put it in.

00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:55.508
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, it can be fixed.

00:51:55.508 --> 00:51:58.080
Shri Mataji: So we should assign&nbsp;
it to some proper. Find a-

00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:01.554
Sahaja Yogi: Mark is organising.

00:52:01.554 --> 00:52:04.055
Another Sahaja Yogi: What&nbsp;
is Mark doing about the van?

00:52:04.054 --> 00:52:07.883
Sahaja Yogi: [Unclear] to find&nbsp;
the keys so he can take it there.

00:52:07.884 --> 00:52:11.654
Shri Mataji: Now there’s one&nbsp;
thing I want to know, this Bard.

00:52:11.653 --> 00:52:14.286
You have to pay him some money or something?

00:52:14.286 --> 00:52:15.782
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, indeed.

00:52:15.782 --> 00:52:16.560
Shri Mataji:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:17.840
I think we should send him the money.

00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:24.080
Otherwise, he’s a nice fellow, but&nbsp;
he’s a great friend of one, Sinhalese.

00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:28.240
And this Sinhalese fellow wants me to go to Siloe.

00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:30.560
He’s quite a nice person.

00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:32.960
And he’s a great friend of Mr. Bard.

00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:37.440
And Bard has given a very funny picture about you.

00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:46.302
Sahaja Yogini: He’s very negative in general.

00:52:46.302 --> 00:52:47.016
Shri Mataji: Hum?

00:52:47.017 --> 00:52:50.505
Sahaja Yogini: He’s a very happy bachelor&nbsp;
[unsure]. [Unclear] Well, when he will.

00:52:50.505 --> 00:52:52.480
Shri Mataji: I never met him. I never met Bard.

00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:55.120
It was his friend who told me about it.

00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:58.800
Sahaja Yogini: Yes. Well, from&nbsp;
our end what happened was-

00:52:58.800 --> 00:52:59.120
Shri Mataji: Hum?

00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:02.880
Sahaja Yogini: Wendy was taking some&nbsp;
things to sell, at this sort of junk shop.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:06.960
And Bard happened to be in the shop because&nbsp;
he was a friend of the man who owned it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:10.160
And he started saying all sorts&nbsp;
of very derogatory things.

00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:11.145
Shri Mataji: Come here, just I can’t hear you.

00:53:11.145 --> 00:53:12.802
Sahaja Yogini: Sorry. He-

00:53:12.802 --> 00:53:14.790
Shri Mataji: Where did she go?

00:53:14.789 --> 00:53:17.440
Sahaja Yogini: Well, just by, oh sorry,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:24.560
amazing, well coincidence if you like, Wendy&nbsp;
took some old books and stuff of ours to sell.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:33.200
And she happened to meet Bard in this sort of&nbsp;
shop, second hand shop. And he happened to be a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:37.600
friend of the person who owns it, that was why he&nbsp;
was in there. And he said lots of very derogatory&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:42.720
things. And Wendy said, she said, “I don’t think&nbsp;
he’s still in Sahaja Yoga “. And then she said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:46.480
“Oh he said some very bad things about Peter&nbsp;
“. So I said, “Well, you know, maybe… “

00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:48.320
Shri Mataji: About Peter he said lots of things.

00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:48.640
Sahaja Yogini: Yes.

00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:52.560
Shri Mataji: But about Me, he said, “Mataji&nbsp;
is too simple. She can’t understand”.

00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:53.280
Sahaja Yogini: Yes.

00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:55.972
Shri Mataji: It’s horrible&nbsp;
things. Horrible things.

00:53:55.972 --> 00:53:57.997
Which I will tell him otherwise.

00:53:57.998 --> 00:54:01.680
Sahaja Yogini: But the other strange thing&nbsp;
that happened is that we haven’t heard anything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:06.320
about him from the point of view of Sahaja&nbsp;
Yoga. And last night he happened to ring up.

00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:12.720
Now what happened was that, I think it was Anne&nbsp;
on the phone and she didn’t know, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:16.800
the whole thing about Bard. And she said,&nbsp;
“Yes, there’s a puja tomorrow at four o’clock”.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:22.320
And he said, “Can I speak to Harry? ” So I said&nbsp;
to Anne, because she was new to him, I said, stop,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:26.640
stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, put a hand over&nbsp;
the phone sort of thing. And I didn’t know if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:30.560
this was right, Mother, but I said that it was&nbsp;
only an invited puja and that certain people,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:33.360
only people who had been invited should&nbsp;
come. And it was only a small thing because I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:38.080
suddenly thought, you know, is there some&nbsp;
negativity trying to sort of come in or? Anyway,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:41.600
he’s probably coming to Caxton Hall because&nbsp;
he said, “When is the next public meeting?”

00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:45.440
Shri Mataji: No, no, he clearly said&nbsp;
that, “I do believe in Sahaja Yoga”.

00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:48.960
You see, this fellow was all&nbsp;
praised for him, he said this.

00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:54.320
I said, “But he did pay some money. I believe what&nbsp;
I heard is that electrical money and all that”.

00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:56.000
And he said, “No, he’s not a man. If you tell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:59.520
him he’ll pay. He’s a [unclear]&nbsp;
formal man for money matters”.

00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:04.640
He said, “He is such a straightforward&nbsp;
person, you can’t imagine and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:07.760
he’s a very fine person and most reliable”.

00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:10.720
I mean, Sinhalese was all praised for him”.

00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:16.400
But he said, “He told about Peter, that Peter&nbsp;
is a dangerous guy and all those things.

00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:19.600
And that’s how he got out from there”.

00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:21.920
And he said that, “Everybody will be in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:24.560
jeopardy”, lots of things&nbsp;
which I’ll tell you later.

00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:26.000
All right, whatever it is.

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:33.840
[To the baby] Now, what’s happening?&nbsp;
Why were you screaming so much?

00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:47.840
Hello? Hello?

00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:58.880
All the time smiling and you are&nbsp;
screaming for nothing at all.

00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:02.320
You are also smiling now.

00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:04.880
Why were you screaming?

00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:10.880
These people are troubling&nbsp;
you a lot? Are they? Yes.

00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:13.600
So what do you do to them?

00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:21.261
You scream at them, you shout at them, he?

00:56:21.261 --> 00:56:21.267
Gavin?

00:56:21.267 --> 00:56:21.520
Sahaja Yogi: Yes

00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:27.040
Shri Mataji: I won’t be able to have lunch&nbsp;
here because Mr. C. P. Srivastava said that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:28.960
“Today at least have lunch with me”.

00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:31.680
So, yesterday he told us I’d better go.

00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:32.847
Oh, oh, oh, oh! What is it? What is it?

00:56:32.847 --> 00:56:32.880
Sahaja Yogini: [Unclear]

00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:45.159
Now wake up.

00:56:45.159 --> 00:56:49.280
[Shri Mataji is laughing]

00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:52.247
She has blue eyes.

00:56:52.247 --> 00:56:54.720
Sahaja Yogini:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:57.747
Well, I don’t know. You see Bumble&nbsp;
started off with eyes that colour.

00:56:57.747 --> 00:57:00.240
Shri Mataji: Yes, she’s got&nbsp;
blue eyes. That’s a nice thing.

00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:01.120
Sahaja Yogini: They changed.

00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:01.920
Shri Mataji [to the baby]: Yes!

00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:05.520
Who had blue eyes in your family?

00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:09.412
Sahaja Yogini: Well, nobody. I didn’t know either.

00:57:09.412 --> 00:57:20.744
Shri Mataji: She has blue eyes.&nbsp;
Oh, you’re all right. Are they?

00:57:20.744 --> 00:57:27.760
Better, hold her a moment.

00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:30.400
So, this is what Bard has&nbsp;
been doing, doesn’t matter.

00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:33.120
But in any case, we should&nbsp;
send him money, whatever it is.

00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:36.400
You should say that, “You just disappeared&nbsp;
and I have to send the money to him “.

00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:39.840
Then another thing is you have to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:46.400
see to it that, you see, when all such&nbsp;
things start, one should not talk.

00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:50.480
Because, you see, whatever it is,&nbsp;
money is different from Sahaja Yoga.

00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:54.160
And one should not talk like this.&nbsp;
It brings bad a name to Sahaja Yoga.

00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:58.160
Nobody should talk. Whatever is the&nbsp;
problem of money you can find it out.

00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:01.424
But why talk about it? It’s a wrong thing.

00:58:01.424 --> 00:58:05.920
[To the baby] No? No, come. You&nbsp;
come to Me for a while. All right?

00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:07.840
I didn’t take her so she…

00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:16.160
[Laughter]

00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:20.320
This dolly baby, this dolly baby. She doesn’t cry.

00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:21.680
Dolly baby doesn’t cry.

00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:26.080
Or you shout or not or&nbsp;
scream sometimes, little bit.

00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:28.320
[Shri Mataji chuckles]

00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:31.760
Look at the smile. Look at that, another one.

00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:35.840
Yes, still sleeping.

00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:38.587
No, no, I’m talking to you.

00:58:38.587 --> 00:58:45.029
No, no, I’m not talking to you,&nbsp;
I’m not talking to anybody else.

00:58:45.029 --> 00:58:48.534
I’m just talking to you. All right?

00:58:48.534 --> 00:58:54.218
What happened? What happened?&nbsp;
What happened? No, no, no, no.

00:58:54.218 --> 00:58:58.670
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. She has to take. Dolly.

00:58:58.670 --> 00:59:01.796
Oh, what happened? What happened?

00:59:01.796 --> 00:59:06.438
I just started talking to him and not to her. He?

00:59:06.438 --> 00:59:11.459
Is she hungry? I think she&nbsp;
is. Oh, she is hungry. He?

00:59:11.459 --> 00:59:12.785
What happened?

00:59:12.785 --> 00:59:16.480
She is hungry, I think. She is hungry.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:17.840
Work very hard.

00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:21.760
You have something too.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:37.242
All right, all right. She is hungry.

00:59:37.242 --> 00:59:40.800
Get her some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:46.812
book. You make a bottle, you have started?

00:59:46.812 --> 00:59:47.754
Child: I ‘m gone one made up.

00:59:47.754 --> 00:59:49.760
Shri Mataji: All right, so you’d&nbsp;
better give. She is crying now.

00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:52.480
So, what have you decided then?

00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:56.040
Sahaja Yogi: I have one idea which I believe-

00:59:56.040 --> 00:59:57.600
Shri Mataji: So just give Me.

00:59:57.600 --> 01:00:03.840
Sahaja Yogi: Paul had also had the idea that&nbsp;
we should maybe make a, try to make a sort&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:11.280
of a documentary, film documentary about Sahaja&nbsp;
Yoga. Perhaps on video. And then, I don’t know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:15.600
twenty minutes, half an hour or something.&nbsp;
Then we could make copies of it, you see.

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:17.720
Shri Mataji: Whenever, but first&nbsp;
actors should be all right now.

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:20.720
Sahaja Yogi: Well, we’ve got a few&nbsp;
and you know, who are not too bad.

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:22.668
[Laughter]

01:00:22.668 --> 01:00:28.474
Shri Mataji: I’m happy to hear.

01:00:28.474 --> 01:00:30.615
Yes. You are so, thank you.

01:00:30.615 --> 01:00:32.756
Are these from your garden?

01:00:32.755 --> 01:00:40.524
Sahaja Yogi: I’m afraid not, Mother. I’m still&nbsp;
busy inside at the moment. I’m afraid I know.

01:00:40.524 --> 01:00:45.439
Shri Mataji: I think [unclear]&nbsp;
this is your tape and all that.

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:47.840
I told Paul, I don’t know&nbsp;
if you understood Me or not.

01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:52.480
It is only handled when&nbsp;
there are people to see it.

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:54.480
Where do we have?

01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:57.440
Sahaja Yogi: Well, what I thought,&nbsp;
there was one thing we could perhaps&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:01.280
then approach people on television&nbsp;
and show them, you see. Because-

01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:02.720
Shri Mataji: But whom are you going to show?

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:04.400
Sahaja Yogi: Well, I don’t know, but if you-

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:07.520
Shri Mataji: That’s the main point, you&nbsp;
know. You do all the experiments, you see.

01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:12.240
He came to me and he told me,&nbsp;
make a video tape of things.

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:14.960
Whom are you going to show, is the point.

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:18.000
We have a reward, lots of&nbsp;
things, but whom to show?

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.760
Only we have to see ourselves.

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:22.480
Another Sahaja Yogi: There is a program&nbsp;
on Sundays, I think it is, on television,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:31.920
which allows people to show, individuals and&nbsp;
groups of people, they have their own program.

01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:32.315
Shri Mataji: We have been-

01:01:32.315 --> 01:01:32.923
Sahaja Yogi: And other things like that.

01:01:32.922 --> 01:01:36.720
Shri Mataji: We have been asking&nbsp;
them to give us even five minutes.

01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:36.769
They have not yet given us.

01:01:36.769 --> 01:01:40.240
Sahaja Yogi: But the thing&nbsp;
is, Mother, if we produce&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:44.000
something which they could just see easily,&nbsp;
then that would give them a much better idea&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.027
of the quality of the thing. And it&nbsp;
wouldn’t actually be so expensive.

01:01:47.027 --> 01:01:48.800
Shri Mataji: We have a film already with him.

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:53.031
Now what you have to do is to edit&nbsp;
it and do it properly, you see.

01:01:53.031 --> 01:01:56.320
Sahaja Yogi: We can make one up&nbsp;
quite cheaply, Mother. We can just,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:59.112
if we need to shoot the whole film, we&nbsp;
can just hire the equipment for few days.

01:01:59.112 --> 01:02:03.680
Shri Mataji: No, that’s not difficult. What&nbsp;
I’m saying that, we have already got to film.

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:05.840
[To the Sahaja Yogini] Now can&nbsp;
you go out and open the door?

01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:16.880
Now, the only thing you have to do is to&nbsp;
get the photographs, I mean here to film it.

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:19.840
He has got already a thing to film.

01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:25.520
Get it edited, you see. And when&nbsp;
you come to India this time, people,

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:32.960
then we can get more films from&nbsp;
India, add them up together.

01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:44.320
This time when I go, I think I can borrow your&nbsp;
camera or something and we can work it out.

01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:45.420
Sahaja Yogi: That’s what I was thinking, Mother.

01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:48.880
Shri Mataji: And then, all that put&nbsp;
together, then we can make a nice film here.

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:50.920
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, that’s what&nbsp;
I thought that we can have.

01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:52.827
Shri Mataji: Well, work it&nbsp;
out. That is one of mine.

01:02:52.827 --> 01:02:56.560
Sahaja Yogi: And we could have&nbsp;
some sort of introduction to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:56.560 --> 01:03:01.179
explaining what Sahaja Yoga is as well.&nbsp;
Showing the chart, and so introduce.

01:03:01.179 --> 01:03:05.600
Shri Mataji: You can do it. But these&nbsp;
are little confusing ones, you see.

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:08.000
Like puja and all that.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.336
Sahaja Yogi: Oh no, it would have to be –

01:03:09.336 --> 01:03:11.920
Shri Mataji: But I’ll have to take a film.

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:17.347
Hello, Don, hello, how are you? May God bless you.

01:03:17.346 --> 01:03:22.370
I’ll take a film – come&nbsp;
along, sit down -from here.

01:03:22.371 --> 01:03:28.400
And Raman is very good at it. And&nbsp;
I’ll ask him to help Me there.

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:29.040
He’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:33.840
going to give Me his projector, which&nbsp;
will you, I’ll bring it to London.

01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:35.920
We can use that projector.

01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:44.320
But you see, the film is, the film that&nbsp;
they have here is 60 millimetres, isn’t it?

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:52.224
Sahaja Yogi: What we have is Super 8. They also&nbsp;
have a Super 8 film there. That’s how I know.

01:03:52.224 --> 01:03:58.613
Shri Mataji: Just find out. Because somebody&nbsp;
told Me that this cannot be converted into that.

01:03:58.613 --> 01:04:02.416
Sahaja Yogi: Into what?

01:04:02.416 --> 01:04:07.046
Shri Mataji: Into films on the TV.

01:04:07.046 --> 01:04:10.640
Sahaja Yogi: Oh, it’s quite easy, Mother. 16 mm,&nbsp;
8 mm films are used, actually, in even certain-

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:17.755
Shri Mataji: Why don’t you find out?&nbsp;
You see, somebody, do you know in the…

01:04:17.755 --> 01:04:24.960
Sahaja Yogi: Quite a lot, Mother. I’ve&nbsp;
known, it’s used quite a lot because&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:31.040
TV cameramen take out their Super 8 sometimes when&nbsp;
they can’t film in a situation. And then they film&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:37.120
with Super 8, and then at the TV studios, they&nbsp;
have a machine which converts it onto video tape.

01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:41.162
Shri Mataji: Ah, you can do it. No problem.

01:04:41.162 --> 01:04:44.316
Another Sahaja Yogi: We might&nbsp;
be able to use it for programs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:44.316 --> 01:04:48.080
Mother. I mean, in remote places, if&nbsp;
you’re not going Mother, we could.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:51.360
I mean, lots of people would come to see&nbsp;
a film when they wouldn’t come to see her&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:55.280
for a lecture, you know what I mean.&nbsp;
Just because you produce some sort of a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:56.625
thing, people would come and see it.

01:04:56.625 --> 01:05:01.600
Shri Mataji: We can do it.&nbsp;
We can get it from India.

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:03.360
I mean, I had this idea before also.

01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:06.080
That’s one of the things we could do.

01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:12.960
But his idea was different. What idea&nbsp;
Paul gave Me was of no use, I thought.

01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:16.960
He said that why not we all get&nbsp;
a video and see the program.

01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:21.840
I said, what’s the use? We are&nbsp;
the seers and we are the doers.

01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:24.889
Sahaja Yogi: No, no, I&nbsp;
wasn’t thinking in that line.

01:05:24.889 --> 01:05:28.842
Shri Mataji: So, that won’t be of&nbsp;
use. But, of a very wide coverage.

01:05:28.842 --> 01:05:31.948
Another Sahaja Yogi: And&nbsp;
then, one could just show it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:31.948 --> 01:05:36.183
if you’re not coming to the program,&nbsp;
as an introduction into Sahaja Yoga.

01:05:36.183 --> 01:05:40.701
Sahaja Yogi: We could show some shots of&nbsp;
you giving us introductory speech at a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:40.701 --> 01:05:44.936
public program, perhaps. And we could&nbsp;
show people experiencing Realization.

01:05:44.936 --> 01:05:47.760
Shri Mataji: Are baba, where I am also available,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:49.840
there are hardly three people.

01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:56.080
Where is such an audience? What I am&nbsp;
saying that, I am quite available.

01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:58.720
I mean, I have been available in Rome.

01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:00.240
Of course, there were not one person.

01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:02.880
We had to pay for the hall,&nbsp;
we had to pay for the room,

01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:05.280
and they did not even publish.

01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:08.720
Now, Gregoire is going to do the next time.

01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:10.080
So this is what it is, you see.

01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:15.840
Sahaja Yogi: But I think it might make a&nbsp;
difference for getting publicity on television.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:19.280
If we can show them something, you&nbsp;
see, which they can see easily.

01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:22.000
Shri Mataji: That is one thing.&nbsp;
That is different, altogether.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.187
Another Sahaja Yogi: If you have more chance&nbsp;
than just writing them a letter, you see.

01:06:25.187 --> 01:06:26.800
Shri Mataji: No, no, that is much better.

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:30.000
There I agree with you that we should&nbsp;
give him a complete thing done,

01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:34.560
plus substantiated by the doctors and&nbsp;
things that they have seen it, you see.

01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:41.680
Sahaja Yogi: Not now, we discussed with Paul&nbsp;
this film idea a long time ago, because we have&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:51.520
got a lot of material, you see. And he only thinks&nbsp;
that he may get, he may wish to buy a video tape.

01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:56.000
Shri Mataji: Oh, no, that is, that&nbsp;
is something I just don’t understand.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:00.640
Sahaja Yogi: But I say, we have got this super&nbsp;
8, we can do a lot professional type films,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:06.039
as long as we get somebody, you see, because&nbsp;
I used to make films sometimes, you see.

01:07:06.038 --> 01:07:10.240
Shri Mataji: No, no. But what I am trying to&nbsp;
tell you, video, this thing is not necessary.

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:14.400
What you have to do is to&nbsp;
prepare a film on Sahaja Yoga.

01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:14.880
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:19.600
Shri Mataji: You have to still get&nbsp;
more material, which I will get now.

01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:25.520
If I am going with this idea, I will get it&nbsp;
up to Australia, all these things. All right?

01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:31.760
Once you have these things with you, then you&nbsp;
assemble them and make a proper commentary

01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:34.160
and make a Sahaja Yoga film.

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:36.960
That you can do it here, later on.

01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:42.080
That’s a different thing, but this video&nbsp;
business, I don’t fit it to my head.

01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:44.880
There is no need just now for having a video.

01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:47.747
You see, that is diverting&nbsp;
the attention. All right?

01:07:47.747 --> 01:07:55.280
Sahaja Yogi: But there is, I asked&nbsp;
other to do something about making a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:58.240
film on Sahaja Yoga, as such. I mean the chakras.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:04.720
But what we need is a good subject with a good&nbsp;
catch, where it’s pulsating. To film, you see.

01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:05.680
Shri Mataji: We have got that.

01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:07.680
Sahaja Yogi: No, we haven’t&nbsp;
got that, unfortunately.

01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:09.040
Shri Mataji: Where is it? In India?

01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:12.240
Sahaja Yogi: No, we haven’t got one. We&nbsp;
need a subject with a very good catch.

01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:16.320
Shri Mataji: No, no, we have&nbsp;
filmed it, India has got it.

01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:20.960
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, maybe it is in India. It’s&nbsp;
not a big deal which we sent last year, is it?

01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:24.496
Shri Mataji: In India they&nbsp;
have got this. I have seen it.

01:08:24.496 --> 01:08:27.406
Sahaja Yogi: Because I knew we had one once,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:27.406 --> 01:08:31.479
but later we need this. It’s no&nbsp;
longer here with me, you see.

01:08:31.479 --> 01:08:32.320
Shri Mataji:&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:34.080
There is one with all these things.

01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:37.121
So we will have to assemble and find out.

01:08:37.121 --> 01:08:39.578
Sahaja Yogi: To edit and put a&nbsp;
commentary and some, you know.

01:08:39.578 --> 01:08:41.753
Shri Mataji: I’ll get you that. That I’ll get you.

01:08:41.754 --> 01:08:42.640
All these things, you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:45.520
see, practical things. We can do that.

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:49.040
Now, what else? This is one suggestion.

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:53.840
But this is only for publicity to the&nbsp;
BBC people, if they want to see it.

01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:57.360
But we can make it. What else is the suggestion?

01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:02.640
What else is the suggestion?

01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:06.835
Sahaja Yogi: Mother, there are&nbsp;
hundreds of groups, in England.

01:09:06.835 --> 01:09:07.692
Shri Mataji: He?

01:09:07.692 --> 01:09:12.031
Sahaja Yogi: There are hundreds of different&nbsp;
groups and societies and everything.

01:09:12.032 --> 01:09:13.800
We can go and give talks to them.

01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:15.032
Shri Mataji: So direct.

01:09:15.032 --> 01:09:16.103
Sahaja Yogi: Direct.

01:09:16.103 --> 01:09:16.800
Shri Mataji:&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:19.840
For that, I was thinking a&nbsp;
pamphlet must be made ready

01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:22.640
and should be sent to these groups.

01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:26.560
And see if they are willing to accept it.

01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:30.960
We can make a nice pamphlet for them.

01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:35.680
What is the third? Write it&nbsp;
down all these points, sir:

01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:39.440
making a film, then making&nbsp;
a pamphlet for the groups.

01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:43.543
Now get the addresses of all these groups.

01:09:43.543 --> 01:09:45.920
Sahaja Yogi: The pre-introduction,&nbsp;
I think, is a very good idea.

01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:49.259
Shri Mataji: It’s very simple directly.

01:09:49.259 --> 01:09:52.400
Sahaja Yogi: Because a lot of people come with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:55.040
idea that Self-realization –&nbsp;
and they’ve heard from other&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:55.760 --> 01:10:02.640
teachers and gurus [unclear] – Self-realization&nbsp;
is hard committed and some sudden foolish show.

01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:05.520
Shri Mataji: Actualization, what&nbsp;
do you expect? It’s the point.

01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:12.960
Sahaja Yogi: The people just think that their&nbsp;
whole life is going to change and the world is&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:16.480
going to look different instantaneously&nbsp;
when they’ve got Self-realization.

01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:24.560
Shri Mataji: It does with many.&nbsp;
But I mean it takes time for some.

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:29.840
Sahaja Yogi: I heard someone mention that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:40.800
it may be good to have some type of – when we’ve&nbsp;
got a person, and we’ve given self-realization,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:43.840
that we don’t actually tell them that&nbsp;
they’ve got their Self-realization yet,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:45.275
that they’ve got to work it out for it.

01:10:45.275 --> 01:10:47.920
Shri Mataji: No, no, no, no.&nbsp;
Whatever it is, we have to tell them.

01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:56.800
No use hiding it. It is&nbsp;
Self-realization, no doubt.

01:10:56.800 --> 01:11:02.560
But the problem with all these people in the West&nbsp;
is, that they don’t know what is Self-realization.

01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:05.600
So, they are to be awakened.

01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:09.600
Because they are naïve, they&nbsp;
don’t know what to expect.

01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:14.240
What is Self-realization, and&nbsp;
Indian knows better, much better.

01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:17.520
Sahaja Yogi: They are all looking for&nbsp;
it but they don’t know what it is.

01:11:18.512 --> 01:11:23.600
Shri Mataji: That’s the introduction. Now&nbsp;
you get the list of all the other motels.

01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:31.520
Sahaja Yogi: This week, we had our first meeting&nbsp;
at university again. And the experience goes like&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:38.000
this. When you talk about yoga, or when&nbsp;
people read about yoga, it is Hatha Yoga&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:47.920
for those people. One only stayed eventually, you&nbsp;
see, and we started to work with her, because she&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:56.720
was starting to sweat from ‘guru Raj’, you see.&nbsp;
She may come again. But I think we do have to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:06.720
get in the pamphlet or different pamphlets for&nbsp;
different types of gurus. As the people who speak&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:10.080
must really know those gurus,&nbsp;
what are their favours, etc.

01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:17.450
Shri Mataji: You know, the thing is, if you&nbsp;
write it down is a dangerous thing. Because –

01:12:17.450 --> 01:12:18.560
Sahaja Yogi: For ourselves.

01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:18.804
[Laughter]

01:12:18.804 --> 01:12:20.320
Shri Mataji: That’s all right for ourselves.

01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:25.920
But if you write it down, this&nbsp;
thing, you will develop a problem.

01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:30.960
I say because they can try to trouble us&nbsp;
and I don’t want to have any controversy.

01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:35.840
So what you can do in the group&nbsp;
when you have the meetings,

01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:41.280
then if somebody says that, “I am such&nbsp;
and such, disciple of such and such, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:44.400
I have been working on this”.

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:47.840
You should say, “All right, we tell&nbsp;
you about it, how to work it out “.

01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:51.800
But keep it a separate session&nbsp;
with that person, individually.

01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:55.360
But not in the public meetings.

01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:58.960
Because I have seen, even I cannot&nbsp;
handle sometimes the way people are&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:00.320
addicted to these gurus.

01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:03.840
So, if you just start any controversy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:07.600
they will have a greater chance&nbsp;
of troubling us, so keep them out.

01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:11.920
You see, our attitude should be&nbsp;
those who want to come can come,

01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:14.160
those who do not want to come, cannot come.

01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:19.280
But we want to give them a clear-cut&nbsp;
picture of what positively, what things are.

01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:21.920
The negativity we need not mention just now.

01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:23.600
Because if you mention the negativity,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:27.360
there could be legal problem, any&nbsp;
type of a problem can come up.

01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:30.000
So just now we don’t want any confrontation.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.760
We’ll just give, “This is the picture,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:33.920
this is what you have to achieve,&nbsp;
this is what you have to get”.

01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:38.400
Now somebody comes with the idea that, “I&nbsp;
am into such and such “, so what about it?

01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:40.080
You say, “Did you find it?” “No”. “So… “.

01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:46.880
You can put this there, that you&nbsp;
have not yet found it, all right?

01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:47.840
This is how you can talk.

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:52.560
But not in the, I mean, individual&nbsp;
cases we should not discuss,

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:54.960
neither in general also we&nbsp;
should talk much about it.

01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:59.840
Because unnecessarily, you see, to&nbsp;
begin with, it creates a- you know,

01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:03.840
it’s so naive, the whole attitude of the West is,

01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:10.400
that they think, you see, if God is&nbsp;
there, then how can there be evil?

01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:13.760
First of all, is it all the responsibility of God.

01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:17.520
And the responsibility of man is to&nbsp;
be evil and the responsibility of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:19.040
God is not to keep evil, you see.

01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:21.200
This is what is the idea of the West is.

01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:21.840
[Shri Mataji chuckles]

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:26.960
Secondly, if God is love, then&nbsp;
how can you say something is bad?

01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:29.920
You see, this is second&nbsp;
nonsensical idea they have.

01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:34.480
This is the worst idea that one&nbsp;
can have, is to say God is love.

01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:41.019
But in his love, He kills people.&nbsp;
He is a wrathful God. It’s written.

01:14:41.019 --> 01:14:46.160
It’s clearly written, He is a wrathful&nbsp;
God and He can bring wrath on you.

01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:48.960
If He loves everyone, then why&nbsp;
does He bring wrath, you see?

01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:56.560
This is second idea, which is very funny and which&nbsp;
is really very confusing for people to understand,

01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:59.120
that there are people who are absolutely evil.

01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:00.160
There’s no God in them.

01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:04.560
So, this is the second idea which&nbsp;
with which they come forward.

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:09.360
Then they say that, “We respect&nbsp;
every person who talks of God”.

01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:10.225
Now what do you say to that?

01:15:10.225 --> 01:15:17.840
Sahaja Yogini: Mother, I think the&nbsp;
most convincing thing, for people,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:22.560
is when they actually start seeing and&nbsp;
experiencing the damage that these people&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:25.680
have done. Because otherwise,&nbsp;
it’s still only a discussion.

01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:27.520
Shri Mataji: Discussion level you cannot talk.

01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:31.360
Discussion level they will win over.

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:35.280
You see, and then the last of all is this,&nbsp;
that when you start discussing with them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:37.120
then you just get fed up.

01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:39.200
And you say, “Oh no, let it be, doesn’t matter”.

01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:43.840
Then they’ll say, “Look at this, they are&nbsp;
supposed to be Yogis and they have no patience”.

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:46.320
Even if they beat you, you are&nbsp;
supposed to say, “All right”.

01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:50.000
One person said, “What about God? Christ said that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.760
if somebody slaps on you or one&nbsp;
cheek, then turn the other”.

01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:59.880
I said, “That is the only solution with&nbsp;
mad people, that’s why. Otherwise it – “

01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:02.160
[Laughter]

01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:06.480
That’s the only way they’ll get shocked when you&nbsp;
tell them that, “Beat me on the other cheek”.

01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:09.520
Nobody will beat you, but&nbsp;
that’s how you can stop them.

01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:10.640
That’s what He was meaning.

01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:15.200
So, that was the only solution for&nbsp;
mad people, that’s why He said it.

01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:19.920
But this is the idea: if you are&nbsp;
a saint, then you must suffer.

01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:21.280
They have a right to boss over you.

01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:27.840
Because of these kinds of ideas, you have to&nbsp;
be very, very careful with them, no doubt.

01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:30.960
So, all these things are there.

01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:35.200
And last lecture in Bonn, you&nbsp;
see, when Thomas was very,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:38.560
very upset about people, how&nbsp;
they are going to aggress.

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:43.520
And some were saying, “These are Eastern ideas&nbsp;
and these are Western ideas, and this and that”.

01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:46.240
Then I lashed them, I wish you&nbsp;
could get my tape from him.

01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:48.800
And then I told the arrogance of the West.

01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:53.360
I said, it’s quite summed up very well,&nbsp;
the way they are arrogant about things

01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:55.760
and they think no end of themselves.

01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:59.920
And this idea of the West and the&nbsp;
East doesn’t exist in my head.

01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:04.960
I said, “The West has done the outgrowing&nbsp;
of a tree. What about the roots?

01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:06.640
Who has to look after the roots?

01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:12.080
The poor East people, Eastern&nbsp;
people are looking after the roots

01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:16.000
and you are just outdoing your&nbsp;
tree, what about your resources?

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.400
You should find it out, otherwise you’d go mad”.

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:22.960
And I mean, they are, no doubt about it.

01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:29.840
But the worst part I heard was, that now&nbsp;
Switzerland is highest in society, more than&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:31.280
Sweden.

01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:34.640
And the second thing I heard about was,

01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:43.840
that out of five families in Switzerland&nbsp;
only one can produce children, can.

01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:57.840
This is the situation. They&nbsp;
cannot produce children.

01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:03.360
And, there was a lady, she said,&nbsp;
“I am very busy with Afghanistan”.

01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:04.960
I said, “Afghanistan?”

01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:09.360
She said, “I am collecting money for&nbsp;
Afghanistan, I am doing this for Afghanistan”.

01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:11.120
I said, “Now what, why is she concerned?”

01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:15.360
In her own family there are six and&nbsp;
seven people who have committed suicide.

01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:18.080
She worried about Afghanistan?

01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:24.560
This is another ego style, is to shift your&nbsp;
attention from your own problems to others,

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:27.120
is to think of Afghanistan.

01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:30.203
I said, “Leave it alone now,&nbsp;
why do you bother with it?”

01:18:30.203 --> 01:18:30.225
[Shri Mataji chuckles]

01:18:30.225 --> 01:18:31.120
She will still look after.

01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:34.160
“The more people who are going to&nbsp;
commit suicide in your family”.

01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:43.600
Sahaja Yogi: It’s funny that all the big rakshasas&nbsp;
have managed to find themselves in Switzerland.

01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:45.920
Shri Mataji: Find?

01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:47.600
Sahaja Yogi: Find themselves in Switzerland,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:50.545
have their headquarters there&nbsp;
like Narakasura and all that.

01:18:50.545 --> 01:18:51.360
Shri Mataji:&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:56.560
All of them are there, you see, because it’s&nbsp;
the most beautiful country in the whole world.

01:18:56.560 --> 01:19:00.560
I would say we have some places like&nbsp;
that in India, which I have in my view,

01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:02.000
but which are absolutely remote.

01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:11.067
But Switzerland is the most beautiful place,&nbsp;
I mean such, such soothing scenes I have seen,

01:19:11.067 --> 01:19:15.600
such beautiful, that you cannot get&nbsp;
that kind of a thing anywhere else.

01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:21.120
So, that’s why. They want to use all&nbsp;
the beauties with the money. Everything.

01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:25.600
And Switzerland is one place they&nbsp;
are very safe there, they think.

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:28.000
Because Swiss government is&nbsp;
only interested in money.

01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:31.200
As long as they give money, it’s all right.

01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:33.760
So they have money and they give&nbsp;
money, it’s a mutual understanding.

01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:37.680
But what about the Queen of&nbsp;
England going to see the Pope?

01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:38.800
I didn’t like it much.

01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:44.720
This is that fornication with&nbsp;
the kings, is it the same?

01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:53.936
But she’s a very sensible woman, I don’t&nbsp;
know why she did it. She’s quite a – Humm?

01:19:53.936 --> 01:19:58.799
Sahaja Yogi: [Unclear]. I mean in&nbsp;
[unclear] lot of people ever heard

01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:03.978
Shri Mataji: Is it? Because of Brazil, is it?

01:20:03.978 --> 01:20:05.659
Sahaja Yogi: [Unclear]. Because of&nbsp;
her son who wants to marry a Catholic.

01:20:05.659 --> 01:20:06.165
Shri Mataji: Huh? Son?

01:20:06.165 --> 01:20:08.080
Sahaja Yogi: Charles wants&nbsp;
to marry a Catholic princess.

01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:09.520
Shri Mataji: That’s why.

01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:13.520
I don’t know why, when I just can’t understand.

01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:18.320
Maybe Brazil, when Brazil is full&nbsp;
of bhoots, it’s absolutely negative.

01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:25.520
And there is this Mexico, all full&nbsp;
of bhoots. Nigeria, everywhere.

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:27.680
Catholicism must have taken bhoots.

01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:33.680
Not only, but Catholicism in Rome&nbsp;
has really opened my eyes, you know.

01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:41.440
The Catholics from Rome who talk to Me&nbsp;
– you can call them Italians – shocking!

01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:42.800
Shocking it is.

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:48.480
They said they are earning&nbsp;
fifty thousand dollars per day.

01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:57.040
There are six hundred schools in&nbsp;
Rome itself, run by the Vatican,

01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:00.800
where there are six thousand&nbsp;
children in every school.

01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:06.640
And the fee is so exorbitant, and&nbsp;
poor people cannot pay for it.

01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:11.280
They are getting money from&nbsp;
places like Chile, Argentina,

01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:13.840
all developing countries who are very poor.

01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:17.600
And telling them, “You cannot have birth control”.

01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:22.960
And the priests cannot marry. Just imagine!

01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:25.973
Sahaja Yogi: The gold that is in Vatican.

01:21:25.973 --> 01:21:26.055
Shri Mataji: The gold and that is a part&nbsp;
from that, I have seen part of it myself.

01:21:26.055 --> 01:21:26.099
That can beat even source [unsure] property.

01:21:26.099 --> 01:21:26.367
Sahaja Yogi: It’s built Mother.

01:21:26.367 --> 01:21:28.599
Shri Mataji: Hum?

01:21:28.599 --> 01:21:41.120
Sahaja Yogi: It’s built on the&nbsp;
site of the Emperor Nero’s old&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:43.120
circus, you know, the Vatican.

01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:44.335
Shri Mataji: Built on the site of?

01:21:44.335 --> 01:21:48.931
Sahaja Yogi: The Emperor Nero, you&nbsp;
know, that big rock in there. Very near.

01:21:48.931 --> 01:21:56.292
Shri Mataji: Very near,&nbsp;
yes. Nero’s house is there.

01:21:56.292 --> 01:22:00.061
But, I must say this Michael Angelo slap them out.

01:22:00.061 --> 01:22:06.092
[Baby is screaming] I have got it. He&nbsp;
doesn’t like to stay seating. All right.

01:22:06.092 --> 01:22:11.520
Sahaja Yogini: He doesn’t like people&nbsp;
talking about things like this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:24.731
Whenever we talk about something&nbsp;
negative, he starts so.

01:22:24.731 --> 01:22:28.639
Shri Mataji: Really? Oh! All&nbsp;
right, all right, all right.

01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:32.080
Now this money, they were saying, these people,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:35.440
that if he was Iran of Shah,&nbsp;
we would have put him down.

01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:40.400
And they are very, very poor, you&nbsp;
know. These people are very poor.

01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:44.880
And they said, “All this money goes there. And&nbsp;
God knows what they are doing. We cannot ask them.

01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:50.080
This is our own money. All the countries,&nbsp;
those who are supporting them are very poor”.

01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:54.800
And they said, “Only one small little spark can&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:57.840
completely put them onto&nbsp;
fire. That is the condition.

01:22:57.840 --> 01:22:59.040
People are so angry with them”.

01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:04.240
And they said, “This one is just a showman fellow.

01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:06.320
This pope is a politician”.

01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:10.320
And also what you call that, pop singer.

01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:17.360
“He is like a pop singer. He is a pop star.&nbsp;
He is a pop star as well as a politician”.

01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:23.520
He said, “And all the money of all the poor&nbsp;
people, he is sucking and they live like Lords”.

01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:25.680
Really, I saw the house and I was amazed!

01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:29.920
But Michel Angelo, he has put them right.

01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:33.200
His Christ and all that. That is&nbsp;
Lambodhara, he has shown as Christ.

01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:36.080
I must show you. I got his paintings&nbsp;
and these things. I will show you.

01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:40.800
The best part he has shown about Judas.

01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:42.480
They are having the Last Supper thing.

01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:44.320
And Judas is sitting there, you see.

01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:48.160
Everybody has got a golden colour aura.

01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:50.240
And this one has an opaque colour on him.

01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:51.520
And a bhoot is sitting here&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:55.680 --> 01:23:56.278
at the Left Agnya, telling him something.

01:23:56.278 --> 01:23:56.306
[Shri Mataji is laughing]

01:23:56.306 --> 01:23:57.280
That is the best part.

01:23:57.280 --> 01:23:59.680
He shows really a little bhoot sitting there.

01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:04.640
You see, they see so clearly the bhoot, you know.

01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:07.680
And the Last Judgement that&nbsp;
they have done on the main&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:12.560
set of the roof, you see, the&nbsp;
Sistine Chapel, they call it.

01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:19.200
There, the Last Judgement is so beautiful&nbsp;
and there Christ is shown as he was.

01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:22.720
But they could not just, that Jonah,&nbsp;
they call him the Jonah on top.

01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:28.320
Jonah is nothing less but our Kalaki&nbsp;
there, sitting on top, you see.

01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:30.560
With a great force he is turning people down.

01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:33.600
Many people are taking birth and&nbsp;
it’s beautiful this Last Judgement

01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:36.960
And Christ, at the Agnya, is very powerful.

01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:40.960
He is a Lambodhara with a big stomach and&nbsp;
all that, very healthy standing there.

01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:43.040
And the Mother sitting at the back.

01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:47.600
I must say Michel Angelo has put him right.

01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:53.963
He has also shown so many priests&nbsp;
and priests going to Hell!

01:24:53.963 --> 01:24:55.023
[Laughter]

01:24:55.023 --> 01:24:56.720
I mean this is,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:56.720 --> 01:25:01.060
and the Protestants are also&nbsp;
horrible people, I think.

01:25:01.060 --> 01:25:02.560
I don’t know what to do with them.

01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:08.080
They are in another way, horribly&nbsp;
fanatics, you see, horribly fanatics.

01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:15.200
There was one priest who came, he was a Catholic&nbsp;
priest, he came to see Me in ordinary dress.

01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:16.960
And I must tell you some good news also.

01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:20.720
So, I didn’t recognize him but&nbsp;
he could not get Realisation.

01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:24.560
So, he wrote Me a letter through&nbsp;
his friend that, “Mother, I must&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:29.600
tell you I was seeking but in Catholicism,&nbsp;
seeking is not allowed. And I am a priest&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:38.320
and I did not get married for the Savouries. So,&nbsp;
I went to, I have been going to a guru, I went to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:44.640
him for three months. He lives near Siloe. Maybe&nbsp;
that is the reason, I am not getting Realisation”.

01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:47.280
So, I saw the vibrations, I said,&nbsp;
“No, he is a Realised soul this guru”.

01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:48.720
And I took down his address.

01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:51.040
So he said, “You know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:56.080
his good friend told me, that he has already&nbsp;
told him that ‘I cannot give Realisation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:56.080 --> 01:26:00.800
Mother has come on this earth. She herself is&nbsp;
in person, you better go and get it from her’.”

01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:05.360
And he told about her. She is her Holiness.&nbsp;
She is Adi Shakti, everything he told.

01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:06.160
Imagine! This guru.

01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:08.480
But the better thing, I’ll tell you.

01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:14.320
We went to Spain and the girl who came with&nbsp;
us, Miriam, was no good for translation.

01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:18.640
So first day somebody offered his services, he&nbsp;
said, “All right, I’ll translate “. He did well.

01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:22.240
But second day, you see, this&nbsp;
fellow did not turn up, he was late.

01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:28.000
And one boy – I have got his address&nbsp;
also, I think she has got – he turned up.

01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:32.480
And he was very good. He organized everything,&nbsp;
did everything, he was very good at English

01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:35.280
and he translated the whole thing&nbsp;
very well in Spain and helped.

01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:41.280
So, he told these people, “You&nbsp;
see, my guru lives on Himalayas.

01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:44.160
I went and see; some guru Swami&nbsp;
or something, Namnemi he told Me.

01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:47.360
And I felt the vibrations were all right.

01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:50.640
And he told me that, ‘You go to&nbsp;
Madrid. Mataji is coming there,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:54.585
go and help her and help her in every way’. “

01:26:54.585 --> 01:27:00.000
[Laughter]

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:04.080
Great! And then he just&nbsp;
disappeared, I never saw him.

01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:14.480
And then, of course the hall was so shocking,&nbsp;
there were a lot of hikes out there.

01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:18.080
But we managed somehow.&nbsp;
It’s all right, we managed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:20.640
it’s not difficult, we can manage these things.

01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:22.520
Only Rome was bit too much, he, Gavin?

01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:24.994
[Shri Mataji chuckles]

01:27:24.994 --> 01:27:28.400
You know, you had to pay that.

01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:31.760
Sahaja Yogi: I haven’t paid&nbsp;
it back yet, but I’m going to.

01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:33.000
Shri Mataji: You’d better not pay them.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.080
Sahaja Yogi: I paid them beforehand.

01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:39.360
Shri Mataji: Hmm, that’s the problem.

01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:41.372
Sahaja Yogi: [Unclear]

01:27:41.371 --> 01:27:47.440
Shri Mataji: No, I paid for the other&nbsp;
things like bill they gave Me, big bill&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:52.080
for the hotel rooms and taxi and this.

01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:53.680
You see, next day we didn’t know what to do.

01:27:54.320 --> 01:28:01.360
So, what we did, we took lot of these pamphlets&nbsp;
and took a taxi and went round postering them.

01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:03.760
So, it cost us about fifty pounds on the taxi.

01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:05.680
[Laughter]

01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:07.920
But what to do, I mean, we didn’t know what to do?

01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:13.840
Because it never appeared.

01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:16.908
Sahaja Yogi: You stayed in a&nbsp;
hotel room? And you stayed in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:16.908 --> 01:28:20.184
a hotel room? The hotel room is&nbsp;
about the most expensive there.

01:28:20.184 --> 01:28:25.176
Shri Mataji: Very expensive, I tell you! Dinner&nbsp;
: for one dinner for both of us, fifteen pounds.

01:28:25.176 --> 01:28:27.360
Sahaja Yogi: But you don’t eat in here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:32.250
you don’t stay in hotels in Italy. No one stays&nbsp;
there, unless they’re very, very well off.

01:28:32.249 --> 01:28:34.799
Shri Mataji: I don’t know, then&nbsp;
where do you stay? There’s no place.

01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:35.200
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:37.926
Shri Mataji: Even in this hotel&nbsp;
they had no dinner, you know?

01:28:37.926 --> 01:28:38.916
Sahaja Yogi: No, no, they don’t have any.

01:28:38.915 --> 01:28:40.959
Shri Mataji: So they said,&nbsp;
“You have to go now to this”.

01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:45.040
We said, “We can’t go to far off places&nbsp;
where we can get some pizza or something,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:47.040
you know, to manage further “.

01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:49.680
So they said, “No, this is&nbsp;
nice place, you can go ahead “.

01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:53.920
And fifteen pounds, I said,&nbsp;
“Very nice for both of us “.

01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:55.840
Seven and a half pounds to however eat.

01:28:55.840 --> 01:28:58.240
So much, I thought, but they’re very expensive.

01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:01.920
Then what we did was to get a pizza, you see.

01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:05.040
But in the night, we just couldn’t do anything.

01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:14.720
Sahaja Yogi: The places to stay in Italy are in&nbsp;
the “Pensiones “, they’re very extremely private,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:17.295
there are people’s homes, they really aren’t –

01:29:17.295 --> 01:29:23.840
Shri Mataji: Now we don’t have to worry,&nbsp;
Gregoire is going to be posted for ten months.

01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:24.640
[Shri Mataji chuckles]

01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:33.360
He has taken the responsibility&nbsp;
now. He’s going to work it out.

01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:34.255
