WEBVTT

03:57.803 --> 03:59.891
Something wrong.

04:01.065 --> 04:04.548
Who has made those with the things…
(hindi).

04:07.010 --> 04:12.189
You should put more of cotton in that,
you see, slips back. (Hindi)

04:18.408 --> 04:20.963
Can you get it done by the… (hindi).

04:43.344 --> 04:45.727
You for pujas you must use Indian girls,
better,

04:45.927 --> 04:48.367
they know all these things better you see.

04:48.567 --> 04:53.451
They said that nobody asked us, so
they just sit on the fence.

06:46.312 --> 06:50.465
They would think that we should not come
forward, because they’ll think

06:50.665 --> 06:53.840
these people are talking too much,
these Indians,

06:54.040 --> 06:57.724
so… I mean, they – when they have to come
they should come.

07:02.980 --> 07:07.161
You can see, yesterday’s film, that we
have a tradition,

07:07.361 --> 07:12.261
you see, we know all these things, isn’t it?
This has been there in that country,

07:12.461 --> 07:18.954
so they should tell you, and you should
not mind that.

07:19.839 --> 07:26.204
They also have the same fear as you have
that they will say “You have a ego”.

07:26.597 --> 07:31.201
I don’t know how to go about with anything.

08:09.389 --> 08:11.766
It’s quite warm. (Hindi)

10:17.141 --> 10:19.422
It’s alright.

10:35.169 --> 10:40.363
I’ll teach you how to make this, alright?
May God bless you.

10:58.835 --> 11:05.021
Today I was thinking that we’ll do the puja
to Mahalakshmi. Will be better,

11:05.221 --> 11:11.316
so that we'll understand what is Vishwa
Nirmala Dharma is.

11:14.744 --> 11:21.342
As you know, the Mahalakshmi principle lies
within all of you, in the center.

11:21.542 --> 11:27.989
And once you are fed up with the falsehood,

11:28.189 --> 11:35.160
and also with the hypocrisy of people,

11:36.154 --> 11:40.815
you start seeking the truth within.

11:41.015 --> 11:48.329
That's how a new category of people are
born, who are called as seekers - sadhakas.

11:48.529 --> 11:52.492
They are very different from others.

11:53.289 --> 12:00.944
They don't care for any material gain

12:01.711 --> 12:09.801
or any power, position.

12:10.001 --> 12:18.271
They want to seek the truth and this
category is the one you are,

12:18.471 --> 12:22.489
and that's why you have come to Sahaja
Yoga.

12:23.419 --> 12:27.802
This comes from your past lives also.

12:28.002 --> 12:30.978
For many people, I think, it's their
past life

12:31.178 --> 12:34.874
which has brought this seeking in them.

12:35.074 --> 12:40.687
Also the affluence through which you have
gone, you got fed up with it,

12:40.887 --> 12:44.814
and you are seeking the truth.

12:46.962 --> 12:51.949
Also, there are people, like in India,
where the tradition is to seek the truth,

12:52.149 --> 12:56.016
from very childhood you are told that money
is not everything,

12:56.216 --> 12:59.535
power is not everything, it’s all falsehood,
you must seek the truth.

12:59.735 --> 13:01.588
So, you are ingrained with it.

13:01.788 --> 13:06.854
These are called as good conditionings,
'su-sanskara'.

13:07.054 --> 13:21.387
Now, if it is the - just a fashion sort
of a thing,

13:22.490 --> 13:25.973
that you get into fashion, that let us seek
the truth

13:26.173 --> 13:32.181
because everybody is talking about truth,
let us have this as a fashion

13:32.381 --> 13:36.089
because everybody is doing it, you see.

13:36.289 --> 13:45.421
Then it can be very dangerous. Such people
get lost.

13:45.621 --> 13:52.346
I've seen people who were drug addicts,
who came to us first in England.

13:53.057 --> 13:56.037
And I was surprised that they were really
seekers,

13:56.237 --> 14:00.527
and they were not taking drugs because
of fashion.

14:00.727 --> 14:04.485
They were just taking it, because they
thought, by taking drugs,

14:04.685 --> 14:09.797
they will get into their Mahalakshmi
principle.

14:10.506 --> 14:15.864
Very intelligent, educated, very smart,
I should say,

14:16.064 --> 14:20.709
people became hippies and they started
taking drugs.

14:20.909 --> 14:28.592
I discovered that their seeking was only
that they should find the truth.

14:28.792 --> 14:33.148
But they had no idea as to what is
the truth is.

14:33.348 --> 14:37.904
So, this Mahalakshmi principle was born
within them.

14:38.104 --> 14:41.093
Sort of started manifesting,

14:41.293 --> 14:45.682
that 'beyond all this there must be
something'.

14:47.417 --> 14:53.065
This category of people are everywhere
in the world.

14:53.929 --> 15:00.697
Especially, I was surprised, in Russia,
where there is no talk of God,

15:00.897 --> 15:03.948
there is no talk of religion.

15:05.804 --> 15:11.974
They are even better than Indians in
understanding Sahaja Yoga.

15:12.174 --> 15:19.668
So the conditionings of every country
has also hampered

15:19.868 --> 15:25.315
the progress of Sahaja Yoga within you
and outside.

15:26.378 --> 15:30.253
So now, first of all to understand
Mahalakshmi principle

15:30.453 --> 15:35.407
we must know that we have two other
channels into which we can jump.

15:35.607 --> 15:38.297
One is the left another is the right

15:38.497 --> 15:43.625
and it depends on what sort of a background
you had in this life.

15:43.825 --> 15:47.521
Because of your background in last life,
you have come to the right path.

15:47.721 --> 15:54.138
But last life is been (being?) covered
by this life.

15:54.338 --> 16:00.102
The surroundings, the country in which you
are born, your friends, parents,

16:00.302 --> 16:07.769
the society in which you lived, has
dominated you in so many ways

16:08.948 --> 16:18.907
that the Mahalakshmi principle doesn't
express itself in that full power

16:19.107 --> 16:22.790
which should really suck in everything else

16:22.990 --> 16:28.803
and put you onto the throne of a sahaja yogi.

16:30.272 --> 16:35.279
So you find people - yesterday there were
so many people for example,

16:35.479 --> 16:42.033
very nice people, they were all seekers
of many lives who came there,

16:42.233 --> 16:48.671
but we do not know how many will come
to Sahaja Yoga

16:48.871 --> 16:53.191
and how many will settle down in Sahaja Yoga,

16:54.308 --> 17:01.400
how many will achieve doubtless awareness.

17:01.966 --> 17:09.804
Again the same problem, that they
start getting

17:10.558 --> 17:15.826
into the habits formed by the left side

17:16.026 --> 17:21.918
or into the ego formed by the right side.

17:22.118 --> 17:27.002
Now for a Sahaja Yogi to keep his
Mahalakshmi principle all right -

17:27.202 --> 17:33.294
has to always introspect, not to look
at others but to introspect.

17:33.494 --> 17:35.995
"What am I doing?

17:36.195 --> 17:41.991
Am I in the left side or on the right side?

17:42.191 --> 17:44.625
Which side [am] I moving?

17:44.825 --> 17:53.364
What side I’m following? Am I in the center?"

17:55.200 --> 18:01.578
Now how will you judge? The best is to feel
your vibrations,

18:01.778 --> 18:07.795
feel your vibrations. But sometimes you
go so far

18:07.995 --> 18:12.281
to the left or to the right, that you just
do not feel vibrations.

18:12.481 --> 18:17.022
Your Mahalakshmi principle is not working.

18:17.222 --> 18:22.736
Then you go on. It's like a complete
derailment, I should say,

18:22.936 --> 18:28.288
a kind of a slope on which you just go on
falling on to that.

18:29.422 --> 18:33.004
So all these conditionings we should
watch out,

18:33.204 --> 18:37.642
in ourselves and in others - how we have
got these problems

18:37.842 --> 18:42.821
that we slip out from the central path.
Imagine a train is going

18:43.021 --> 18:49.144
on a proper railway track and suddenly
it starts moving this way or that way.

18:49.344 --> 18:55.499
So, where will it end up? Into destruction
going. But you have a way

18:55.699 --> 19:03.031
of arranging that this derailment can be
brought back to the middle path.

19:03.231 --> 19:08.977
So in a very detached way if you look
at yourself like a witness

19:09.177 --> 19:12.342
and see for yourself, not about others...
even when I give lectures

19:12.542 --> 19:14.394
people start saying, "Oh Mother is saying
about somebody else."

19:14.594 --> 19:19.120
No, I am saying about you, yourself.
So you watch out that,

19:19.320 --> 19:26.876
"Are you in the center or are you going
to the left or to the right."

19:27.283 --> 19:33.610
First of all, those who are in the center
should not have any physical problems.

19:33.810 --> 19:38.943
Should be able to completely cure
themselves.

19:39.143 --> 19:43.483
If not others, they should be able to cure
themselves.

19:43.683 --> 19:52.864
Secondly, a person who is in the center
is a very peaceful person.

19:53.064 --> 19:57.175
He is never angry. He might put up a show
that you are angry.

19:57.375 --> 20:03.236
But he doesn't get involved into anger
or any emotions whatsoever.

20:03.436 --> 20:11.438
He just watches and he can act. He can act
to be in that feeling

20:11.638 --> 20:19.301
of temper also lust, greed, anything -
but just to act.

20:19.501 --> 20:24.360
Because sometimes this acting is needed
so he can use it.

20:24.560 --> 20:28.496
But you should be sure, first of all, that
you are completely detached.

20:28.696 --> 20:33.602
So first of all, before acting you must
become a master of acting.

20:33.802 --> 20:40.632
And for that you have to become your Self.
If you become your Self

20:40.832 --> 20:48.321
then you are a master and you can see
where are you going.

20:49.150 --> 20:56.631
Now the difference between a sahaja yogi
and a sahaja yogi who is like this,

20:56.831 --> 21:02.926
as you say, is this, that he is capable
of going to the left or to the right.

21:03.126 --> 21:06.691
They are not solidly sahaja yogis,

21:07.341 --> 21:10.428
and they go on like this and there is
no progress. Imagine

21:10.628 --> 21:13.925
any airplane which is wobbling like that:
will be on the ground only.

21:14.125 --> 21:20.754
Nobody will be able to put it up in the air,

21:20.954 --> 21:25.265
because God knows what time -
when will it fall down.

21:25.465 --> 21:29.295
So for any machinery, we have to fix it up
properly first,

21:29.495 --> 21:35.146
before we start working it out.
To fix up our

21:36.710 --> 21:41.333
Mahalakshmi principle, you have to see
that your physical being

21:41.533 --> 21:44.700
is all right, is normal, no problem.

21:44.900 --> 21:48.761
I am not meaning the modern ways
of looking at health

21:48.961 --> 21:52.112
but that you should feel healthy and happy.

21:52.312 --> 21:56.692
You should feel that there is no problem
with your physical being.

21:56.892 --> 22:01.025
But if you are a complaining type (like)
I am here paining, I’m paining there,

22:01.225 --> 22:04.409
then there is something wrong with you.

22:06.735 --> 22:13.077
This is the first criteria that you are
in the center.

22:14.075 --> 22:20.240
Then your attention should be more
towards nature -

22:20.440 --> 22:25.800
how the nature is, how it is blossoming,
how it is working out.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.422
It should be towards the sky, stars
and things.

22:29.622 --> 22:34.612
Just to enjoy all the creation that is
around, just to enjoy it.

22:34.812 --> 22:41.596
That’s an enjoyment which is really
so surprisingly deep.

22:41.796 --> 22:45.309
When you see something, beautiful scene
or something -

22:45.509 --> 22:51.376
you go to a very beautiful place, then
a kind of a joy that pours in you

22:51.576 --> 22:55.945
from your Sahastrara, that also you
must experience.

22:56.145 --> 22:59.421
Also you must experience your thoughtless
awareness,

22:59.621 --> 23:04.758
that is when you look at something beautiful
you should suddenly become thoughtless.

23:04.958 --> 23:11.659
Just start seeing it. The whole joy will
start pouring on you.

23:11.859 --> 23:19.706
Then another thing is that you should not
differentiate between religions.

23:19.906 --> 23:23.173
You should not condemn any religion.

23:23.373 --> 23:28.200
But the people who are stupid and call
themselves religious,

23:28.400 --> 23:30.843
they can be condemned, because they are
stupid.

23:31.043 --> 23:34.169
They have not followed the principle
of religion at all.

23:34.369 --> 23:39.541
They are not realized souls and that's what
they are making a mistake.

23:39.741 --> 23:43.879
So that's all right. For example churches
can be condemned,

23:44.079 --> 23:49.984
but not Christ, not the Bible, not at all,
never.

23:50.184 --> 23:54.627
So, when you see to the roots - roots are
all right, but now as I said,

23:54.827 --> 23:59.213
that these flowers have been plucked
by people and they are fighting.

23:59.413 --> 24:03.711
So you should never condemn any incarnation,

24:03.911 --> 24:10.053
any religion, any prophet.

24:10.253 --> 24:13.307
I mean you will not condemn. It is not
question of I’m saying, "Don't do it".

24:13.507 --> 24:17.884
You will just not do it. You will respect
all of them automatically,

24:18.084 --> 24:22.382
because now you are born into it. If you,
say, are a Christian,

24:22.582 --> 24:25.530
you will respect Hindu scriptures.

24:25.730 --> 24:29.467
If you are a Hindu you’ll respect
an Islamic Quran.

24:29.667 --> 24:32.436
That has to be there. If it is not so,

24:32.636 --> 24:37.197
then please know that you are not yet a sahaja yogi.

24:37.397 --> 24:41.625
There should be no malice about any
religion whatsoever.

24:41.825 --> 24:45.030
No religion has done any wrong so far.

24:45.230 --> 24:49.430
It's the people who follow them in a wrong
way, use it for money,

24:49.630 --> 24:56.398
use it for power and also are stupid.
For them it's different.

24:56.598 --> 25:02.554
But for you, every religion is your
own religion.

25:02.754 --> 25:06.446
So we cannot be fundamentalist.

25:06.646 --> 25:09.951
We cannot fight for fundamentalism.

25:10.151 --> 25:14.797
Vishwa Nirmala Dharma which is based
on the Mahalakshmi principle,

25:14.997 --> 25:22.528
is the essence of all the religions,
the truth of all the religions.

25:22.728 --> 25:28.318
And we seek with our pursuits

25:28.518 --> 25:33.202
what are the common points in all these
religions. We try to neutralise

25:33.402 --> 25:36.960
which are not common points

25:37.160 --> 25:41.708
and find out with our research/pursuits

25:41.908 --> 25:49.006
that this one was not the correct thing,
but is not in the religion,

25:49.206 --> 25:54.814
people are following like that. There are
so many things you can find out.

25:55.014 --> 26:01.495
If in the Bible, if you remove Paul
you will cleanse most of it.

26:01.695 --> 26:05.753
If Paul is not there, I tell you, most
of the Christianity can be cleansed out,

26:05.953 --> 26:09.774
because he started confessions, he started
all this nonsense.

26:09.974 --> 26:13.077
He started making people feel guilty,
I mean,

26:13.277 --> 26:17.501
and treating women as nothing.
All Mr. Paul has done it

26:17.701 --> 26:22.802
and he had no right to be there in the
Bible ibecause he never knew Christ.

26:23.865 --> 26:28.226
He was an epileptic and he saw some cross
means some sort of a...

26:28.426 --> 26:34.369
I don't know how far it is truth. But he
said he saw a cross. So what?

26:34.569 --> 26:38.151
Seeing the cross doesn't mean you become
the cross.

26:38.351 --> 26:45.243
Also he wanted to jump on the platform.
Nice platform is made, all right, for you.

26:45.443 --> 26:53.963
And he has powers, and he wants to have
powers, so, he jumps on the platform.

26:54.163 --> 26:58.522
Then he organizes Christianity.
All his mistery.

26:58.722 --> 27:01.524
Never in the Bible is said, never
Christ said,

27:01.724 --> 27:06.188
that you should organize Christianity,
nor has He said

27:06.388 --> 27:10.976
that you should confess or you should
feel guilty.

27:11.176 --> 27:15.189
All the time He has been talking
of forgiveness.

27:15.389 --> 27:19.126
In that short time also, He has given
the truth to us.

27:19.326 --> 27:27.080
But I mean, if somebody wants to interpret,
then it goes wrong.

27:27.280 --> 27:32.291
So this - another point of a sahaja yogi is,
whatever I say

27:32.491 --> 27:36.906
they don't have to interpret, they know it
exactly what I say.

27:37.106 --> 27:41.235
If they start interpreting, then there is
something wrong with them.

27:41.435 --> 27:45.517
Their brains are not all right, they are
not normal. You cannot interpret Me.

27:45.717 --> 27:49.135
Whatever I say, I say in a very simple
English language.

27:49.335 --> 27:52.365
I do not use Shakespearean language
or something like that.

27:52.565 --> 28:00.188
I modulated My Standard of English up to
the normal common people’s language,

28:00.388 --> 28:03.454
and if you start interpreting it,

28:03.654 --> 28:08.359
that means something definitely very,
very wrong with you.

28:08.559 --> 28:11.806
There is nothing to interpret. I am saying
straightforward things

28:12.006 --> 28:16.696
which need not be interpreted. This is
a very important thing.

28:16.896 --> 28:23.645
But many sahaja yogi's who are half-baked,
I should say, start interpreting Me,

28:23.845 --> 28:26.224
because they think they have brains
to interpret.

28:26.424 --> 28:32.671
You have no brains of that caliber that
you can interpret Me.

28:32.871 --> 28:36.337
There are no interpretations. Whatever
I have said, I have said it

28:36.537 --> 28:39.258
and there is no need to interpret.

28:39.458 --> 28:43.320
This is one of the signs that you are
not in the center.

28:43.520 --> 28:48.982
Either you have been possessed or you
have become egoistical.

28:49.182 --> 28:56.380
So, one, to keep yourself in the center,
to be solidly sahaja yogis,

28:56.580 --> 29:01.150
first of all there should be no
interpretations of what I say.

29:01.350 --> 29:05.172
If you think that I am meaning something
else, you can write to Me,

29:05.372 --> 29:09.692
but don't interpret and start a big
organization

29:09.892 --> 29:17.371
against Sahaja Yoga. This is the greatest
mistake that people do it.

29:17.571 --> 29:22.027
I have told many people that you should not
give lectures about Sahaja Yoga.

29:22.227 --> 29:25.242
Because once they start giving lectures,
also sometimes they get

29:25.442 --> 29:30.333
into derailment. Either they get egoistical
or they say things,

29:30.533 --> 29:35.853
as they say, out of their hats, which I
have never said, which are not to be said.

29:36.053 --> 29:39.411
So unless and until you are a solid
sahaja yogi,

29:39.611 --> 29:43.474
I think you should not talk about Sahaja
Yoga. Best is to give realization.

29:43.674 --> 29:49.347
Though you are half-baked, you can give
realization. That's one point for sure.

29:49.547 --> 29:52.785
And those who will get will remain
sahaja yogis.

29:52.985 --> 29:57.263
I have seen people who have given
realization to others are gone cases,

29:57.463 --> 30:02.188
while those whom they have given
are perfect.

30:04.558 --> 30:09.133
Now when somebody gives you
the realization, he is not your guru

30:09.333 --> 30:15.220
by any chance. He is not your guru and have
no sort of a awe

30:15.420 --> 30:20.212
or an obligation towards that person
who has given you realization.

30:20.412 --> 30:25.940
If you do that way, then the ego
of that man wouldn't go away

30:26.140 --> 30:29.568
and you will have conditioning.

30:29.768 --> 30:33.077
You will always stand by that person
though he has done wrong.

30:33.277 --> 30:36.051
Though he is absolutely not a sahaja yogi,
you will stand by that person.

30:36.251 --> 30:41.442
With him you also move to the direction
in which he has moved.

30:41.642 --> 30:45.777
So in Mahalakshmi principle, one has
to be careful, absolutely,

30:45.977 --> 30:49.501
to see where are we going.

30:51.338 --> 30:54.767
Now the group system starts, also with
the same.

30:54.967 --> 30:59.505
There is a big fraternity of 'bhoots',
I must tell you.

31:01.436 --> 31:05.159
If you go to the left, all the leftist
will join you.

31:05.359 --> 31:08.354
If you go to the right, all the rightist
will join you.

31:08.554 --> 31:12.774
Then they’ll fight among themselves
and get out of it.

31:13.838 --> 31:19.853
Now for sahaja yogis, who believe
in fighting back, in grouping back,

31:20.053 --> 31:24.094
they should know, they have derailed.
Maybe they were very intelligent,

31:24.294 --> 31:28.772
they thought they could do that, maybe.
But none intelligence,

31:28.972 --> 31:34.143
none of them are above the Divine
intelligence.

31:34.343 --> 31:37.097
But when you start moving out
of Mahalakshmi thing,

31:37.297 --> 31:42.424
you become like a common person, even
worse than a common person, I would say.

31:42.624 --> 31:49.073
So then you are grabbed by the negative
forces which are around us.

31:49.273 --> 31:55.796
Just like all others are grabbed, you are
also grabbed.

31:56.201 --> 32:02.573
There are conditionings, which also
we should see “do we have”.

32:02.773 --> 32:07.642
Say a western person must see western
conditionings

32:07.842 --> 32:10.738
very clearly. What are these
conditionings? Because we are

32:10.938 --> 32:15.146
seekers of truth, we do not belong
to any country. We belong

32:15.346 --> 32:19.619
to the universe, Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.
We do not belong to Australia,

32:19.819 --> 32:23.563
we do not belong to Brisbane. You see
this belonging

32:23.763 --> 32:28.761
becomes so small and so mean that
ultimately it will become, we belong

32:28.961 --> 32:34.750
to this street and then we belong to this
room, and we belong to this bathroom.

32:34.950 --> 32:37.978
Start going down, down, down, so much.

32:38.178 --> 32:42.773
While is it Vishwa Nirmala Dharma. Means
it is a universal religion,

32:42.973 --> 32:47.305
we belong to the universe. We are part
and parcel of the universe,

32:47.505 --> 32:53.462
not only belonging to one place or one
location. We cannot.

32:53.662 --> 32:58.783
Now we have gone into eternal life. We have
gone to something that is unlimited.

32:58.983 --> 33:01.694
So we belong to this universe.

33:01.894 --> 33:05.906
Once you realize that you belong to this
universe, you should also know

33:06.106 --> 33:09.932
what conditionings are still sticking on
to us

33:10.132 --> 33:16.531
from this country, from this culture,
from this place,

33:16.731 --> 33:19.979
from this household, from this family,

33:20.179 --> 33:24.429
like a little lotus that comes out
of the mud.

33:24.629 --> 33:29.124
Slowly, slowly it throws away all the mud
that is sticking on to it.

33:29.324 --> 33:34.784
Ultimately it comes out as a very
clean flower.

33:34.984 --> 33:38.373
From the mud it gets to the water,
cleanses itself

33:38.573 --> 33:42.519
and comes out as a beautiful flower,
absolutely fragrant,

33:42.719 --> 33:46.236
and then it spreads its fragrance
all around,

33:46.436 --> 33:51.170
so that, that mud also gets fragrance.

33:51.370 --> 33:55.555
That's your job. That’s what you have
to be.

33:55.755 --> 33:59.891
Because you are not a seeker of truth
for yourself but for the whole world.

34:00.091 --> 34:03.194
Because you belong to Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

34:03.394 --> 34:09.277
This Mahalakshmi principle is not for you
alone, but it is for the whole world,

34:09.477 --> 34:14.221
and you have to give it to the whole world.
So now you are here

34:14.421 --> 34:19.623
forming a new kind of a race, a new kind
of a society,

34:19.823 --> 34:28.889
which is enlightened, which is standing
on the truth and love.

34:29.446 --> 34:35.859
Of course, you must understand that
there should be compassion.

34:36.059 --> 34:41.929
Look at that child, my God!

34:44.219 --> 34:49.946
That’s another condition of the children
here. They must do something to get hurt.

34:50.146 --> 34:54.891
It’s very common. All the time, they do
things that will hurt them.

34:55.091 --> 34:58.676
They cannot sit quiet. It’s very surprising.

34:58.876 --> 35:02.985
In India you find children will sit quiet
for three hours - four hours,

35:03.185 --> 35:07.269
as long as the pujas are. Now here
the children are, I don't know

35:07.469 --> 35:11.297
but I am going to find out a solution
for this. They just cannot keep quiet.

35:11.497 --> 35:16.895
And now in America, they are suffering
from overactivity, is a disease,

35:17.095 --> 35:20.275
it is a disease now. They don't know what
to do with the overactive children.

35:20.475 --> 35:27.525
They are overactive. But I think I'll be
able to find out some solution for that.

35:27.725 --> 35:32.900
But as far as you are concerned you are
your own solution.

35:33.100 --> 35:42.324
You can watch yourself. You want to be people
who are spiritually very well equipped.

35:42.524 --> 35:47.170
For that equipment you must see yourself,
where are you,

35:47.370 --> 35:53.991
what are you doing? What's your style
of life?

35:54.191 --> 35:58.461
A solid sahaja yogi or a yogini everyone
knows all over the world.

35:58.661 --> 36:03.219
They are solid. Nothing can deter them.

36:04.251 --> 36:08.416
And you can also know about yourself.
It’s not that you cannot know.

36:08.616 --> 36:15.599
All of you can know yourself very well
because now you are quite sensitive

36:15.799 --> 36:20.225
and you have your own centers enlightened
by Mahalakshmi principle.

36:20.425 --> 36:26.795
The Kundalini has definitely enlightened
your Mahalakshmi principle.

36:26.995 --> 36:30.509
So you can always make out where are we,
what my chakras are,

36:30.709 --> 36:36.476
how are they catching, where are they
catching. Instead of avoiding that,

36:36.676 --> 36:41.548
you just work it out - what's the problem,
where is the problem?

36:41.748 --> 36:46.681
Once you work it out then you will be
surprised that,

36:46.881 --> 36:52.196
as soon as your desire goes inward,

36:52.396 --> 36:58.536
the Kundalini itself will rush through
and She will cleanse your chakras.

36:58.736 --> 37:01.978
As I was telling you, we do not know
our powers.

37:02.178 --> 37:07.029
Only one thing you have to do is
to desire. You have to desire that,

37:07.229 --> 37:12.198
let my vibrations be all right,
let my chakras be cleared out,

37:12.398 --> 37:17.406
let me be in the center, in the balance.
Just you have to desire.

37:17.606 --> 37:23.059
I mean it’s such a simple thing to desire.
But that also we cannot do.

37:23.259 --> 37:27.422
Our desires are something else.
Not what we have to be.

37:27.622 --> 37:33.980
Just you have to desire that: let me be
a clean sahaja ogi.

37:34.180 --> 37:37.937
Let me be a solid Sahaja Yogi.
There are mediocres

37:38.137 --> 37:42.264
who can never be. I am not talking
about them. But so many

37:42.464 --> 37:48.562
can be very high up, can be very high up
in Sahaja Yoga.

37:48.762 --> 37:53.678
But their desires are not yet being
fully manifested. .

37:53.878 --> 38:00.877
Then there is a damping effect of so many
things I have told you about.

38:01.077 --> 38:04.084
So supposing you have to catch the plane,

38:04.284 --> 38:08.205
then you don't get down on the way
somewhere and stay out.

38:08.405 --> 38:11.669
In the same way, when your Kundalini
has to rise,

38:11.869 --> 38:15.666
you can see everything that’s happening.
But keep yourself aloof,

38:15.866 --> 38:18.546
because you have to reach your point
and that is

38:18.746 --> 38:25.961
through this Mahalakshmi principle.
It is a principle that is so detached.

38:26.161 --> 38:29.578
It is the nourishing principle within us,

38:29.778 --> 38:34.005
which nourishes our centers, which
nourishes our character,

38:34.205 --> 38:39.075
which nourishes our religion, that is
Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

38:39.275 --> 38:44.164
It nourishes everything. It nourishes
our brain, our intellect,

38:44.364 --> 38:49.250
everything, it nourishes this Mahalakshmi
principle, above all

38:49.450 --> 38:53.875
it is the balancing. It balances you.

38:54.075 --> 39:01.558
If you are overdoing something, then
it gives you a kind of a push.

39:01.758 --> 39:08.897
If you are not doing anything, again it
works in such a manner that it balances you.

39:09.593 --> 39:13.992
So this is the guiding factor for you,
this Mahalakshmi principle,

39:14.192 --> 39:18.825
which works out everything you can say

39:19.025 --> 39:25.680
that is balancing, the equilibrium
and the wisdom.

39:25.880 --> 39:33.367
As the light of Mahalakshmi principle
starts, the wisdom dawns upon you.

39:33.567 --> 39:38.941
But the greatest of all is the love.
Love for God,

39:39.141 --> 39:46.640
love for truth and you thrive on that love.
Just you are there.

39:46.840 --> 39:49.522
I mean, I asked him, "Why so many
are here?" They said,

39:49.722 --> 39:55.458
for the puja. Why? This is a sign that
you are great sahaja yogis,

39:55.658 --> 39:59.807
that you are here because of puja, that
you understand the value of puja

40:00.007 --> 40:04.721
and that you need the puja, that you enjoy
because it is nourishing to you.

40:04.921 --> 40:11.251
Is a very good thing because that shows
that you are very much there.

40:11.451 --> 40:15.129
You are very much understanding
the importance of right things

40:15.329 --> 40:19.246
and you want to do it at any cost.

40:19.446 --> 40:26.319
All these desires are significant because
they show that you are

40:26.519 --> 40:31.660
in the Mahalakshmi principle and you want
to keep on that one.

40:32.848 --> 40:40.130
I would say, there is a simple one that
you can do is just to be on My Kundalini.

40:40.330 --> 40:44.097
If you can, just try to be in My Kundalini

40:44.297 --> 40:46.923
- on My Kundalini. Just put attention.
You can, all of you can.

40:47.123 --> 40:51.510
Any problem, just put your attention onto
My Kundalini. And you will be all right.

40:51.710 --> 40:57.319
You will just become thoughtless, because
there is no thought.

40:58.874 --> 41:03.048
This is the best way to do it, is to just
solve all problems

41:03.248 --> 41:09.751
by putting attention on My Kundalini and
by that your ego will definitely dissolve,

41:09.951 --> 41:12.656
because then you will know that Mother
is doing everything, I am doing nothing,

41:12.856 --> 41:16.608
so why should I be proud of it.

41:16.808 --> 41:21.660
Also the conditionings will dissolve because

41:21.860 --> 41:28.217
my Kundalini is absolutely pure. That’s -
It is not attached to anyone.

41:28.417 --> 41:33.391
It is not even attached to Sahaja Yoga.
It is not attached to anyone.

41:33.591 --> 41:37.493
The job it has got to do is to nourish
everything.

41:37.693 --> 41:42.818
If it can nourish well and good. If it does
not nourish, well and good.

41:43.018 --> 41:47.081
It depends on what do you want. You want
to be nourished - all right,

41:47.281 --> 41:52.137
so the Kundalini is there, the Mahalakshmi
principle is there. It will nourish you.

41:52.337 --> 41:56.433
But if you don't want, nobody is going
to force you in any way.

41:56.633 --> 42:02.759
Nobody is going to jump on you or form
some sort of a formidable oppression.

42:02.959 --> 42:05.219
Nothing of the kind.

42:06.455 --> 42:10.312
It's just like a river Ganges, you can say,
which is flowing.

42:10.512 --> 42:15.101
Now if you want you can fill up your
pitchers.

42:15.301 --> 42:18.518
If you don't want, She is not going
to enter into your pitchers.

42:18.718 --> 42:22.938
She is not going to come in your house
and get into your pitchers.

42:23.138 --> 42:31.089
So there has to be a desire to get it and
that is what is called is 'Bhakti'.

42:31.289 --> 42:37.891
'Bhakti' is the desire, the devotion to get

42:40.914 --> 42:46.112
the joy of Bhakti. It's such a beautiful
thing.

42:46.312 --> 42:51.266
I wish, I could do the Bhakti to someone,
but I can't do.

42:51.466 --> 42:54.986
Because I see you, when you are in Bhakti,
you just get lost into it.

42:55.186 --> 42:59.010
So much you enjoy, such an enjoyable thing.

42:59.210 --> 43:02.014
Then you don't think, you just enjoy
the Bhakti.

43:02.214 --> 43:10.775
And that’s what is the most coveted,
highest state

43:10.975 --> 43:17.587
where you are just one with the divine
and just swimming in the ocean of joy.

43:17.787 --> 43:20.966
So this Mahalakshmi principle is to be
preserved

43:21.166 --> 43:25.526
and has to be always watched
and looked into.

43:25.726 --> 43:29.428
And the blessings of Mahalakshmi are
so many that,

43:29.628 --> 43:31.933
I tell you, I cannot even tell them

43:32.133 --> 43:34.626
in one lecture. I'll have to give at least
ten lectures.

43:34.826 --> 43:40.314
But you yourself know what are the blessings
of this Mahalakshmi principle is.

43:40.514 --> 43:44.801
The greatest is the complete
self-contentedness,

43:45.001 --> 43:48.285
is absolutely self-contented.

43:48.485 --> 43:55.038
You don't want to grab something, you
don't want to run after something,

43:55.238 --> 43:59.262
you are just self contended. You don't
want any publicity,

43:59.462 --> 44:07.243
you don't want any comfort, nothing.
You are comfortable in your spirit.

44:07.443 --> 44:13.089
This is the greatest blessing of this
Mahalakshmi principle,

44:13.289 --> 44:19.587
and if that is so, then why not we look
after our Mahalakshmi principle

44:19.787 --> 44:23.061
and forget about the rest.

44:23.261 --> 44:27.204
Last of all, when it enters into your brain,

44:27.404 --> 44:36.957
then the Virata is manifesting and you
become collective, absolutely collective.

44:37.608 --> 44:40.475
It’s such a beautiful thing
is to be collective.

44:40.675 --> 44:43.313
There was a girl who went to Sicily

44:43.513 --> 44:46.694
and she was in a restaurant eating
something alone.

44:46.894 --> 44:52.003
And then she looked at somebody else
and that girl also looked at her.

44:52.203 --> 44:57.740
And this one got up and came to her and
she said... they were not wearing badges.

44:57.940 --> 45:04.593
They said, 'Have you been to Shri Mataji -
Yes, Have you been - Yes.'

45:04.793 --> 45:10.081
'We are Sahaja Yogis - Yes.' And then they
just embraced each other with such joy.

45:10.281 --> 45:15.773
In a far-fetched place somewhere in Sicily,
in some restaurant, imagine!

45:15.973 --> 45:21.899
They just got lost. The feeling of fondness,
the brotherhood, the friendship

45:22.099 --> 45:27.759
is so great and so joyous. You don't then
consider from what country you are,

45:27.959 --> 45:30.790
from where do you come, what is
the color of your skin,

45:30.990 --> 45:33.997
or what is the religion you had followed,

45:34.197 --> 45:40.840
what your parents are. You just enjoy
meeting people.

45:41.040 --> 45:47.264
This friendship, this joy comes from
the same Mahalakshmi principle,

45:47.464 --> 45:52.003
when She enlightens your Sahastrara.

45:52.203 --> 45:56.525
In the Sahastrara you get this feeling
of the whole

45:56.725 --> 46:00.188
and the feeling of the whole is something
so great.

46:00.388 --> 46:04.200
Individualism, people talk, but it is
against the principle of whole.

46:04.400 --> 46:08.628
Who do not know the whole you see
talk of individualism.

46:08.828 --> 46:14.492
This individualism which has worked
all kinds of dangers for us

46:14.692 --> 46:18.232
- now, we have to know that we are one
with the whole.

46:18.432 --> 46:25.950
Of course, we are individuals in the sense
that we have different, different faces,

46:26.150 --> 46:30.050
different clothes, different living,
different relationships,

46:30.250 --> 46:34.744
but we belong to the whole.

46:35.549 --> 46:40.644
And this Virata’s feeling that we are part
and parcel of the whole

46:40.844 --> 46:45.288
gives you complete peace and complete
protection.

46:45.488 --> 46:51.035
You never feel that something can happen
to you – never feel.

46:52.059 --> 46:54.461
Some accident will take place, all right,
will take place,

46:54.661 --> 46:58.113
but nothing will happen to me.
I am a sahaja yogi.

46:58.927 --> 47:04.112
So many people have gained like this,
by allowing themselves

47:04.312 --> 47:09.650
to be completely looked after by this
Mahalakshmi principle.

47:09.850 --> 47:14.918
Just surrender to the Mahalakshmi principle
means that you give up your ego

47:15.118 --> 47:19.136
and you give up your conditionings.
You give up both the things.

47:19.336 --> 47:21.782
Just surrendering to your Mahalakshmi
principle.

47:21.982 --> 47:26.118
That's why Mahalakshmi is so important.

47:27.137 --> 47:30.328
May God bless you all.
