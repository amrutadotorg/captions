00:00:02.021 --> 00:00:05.710
I again see today some new faces

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.070
who have come here,

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.396
and I have to explain again today,

00:00:15.396 --> 00:00:20.426
for the first time to them,

00:00:20.436 --> 00:00:25.973
what is Sahaja Yoga,

00:00:25.976 --> 00:00:30.954
which has been promised in various scriptures

00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:37.226
that you have to get your Second Birth.

00:00:37.247 --> 00:00:39.747
You have to be born again.

00:00:39.736 --> 00:00:43.549
It is said. Christ has said too,

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:46.039
the same thing.

00:00:48.091 --> 00:00:52.081
But people have not been able to ponder

00:00:52.087 --> 00:00:59.151
on this subject: what does that mean – our Second Birth?

00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:03.393
Are we not already born as human beings?

00:01:03.393 --> 00:01:06.673
We are born

00:01:06.683 --> 00:01:09.135
but the human beings, which are born,

00:01:09.134 --> 00:01:12.313
are told that you are to be 'born again.'

00:01:12.303 --> 00:01:15.095
Now what are we going to do?

00:01:15.095 --> 00:01:20.105
So they asked, "Are we to enter
into our mother's womb again?

00:01:20.086 --> 00:01:23.785
And are to be born again?"

00:01:23.791 --> 00:01:30.851
He said, :You'll be born of the
Holy Ghost, of the Holy Spirit."

00:01:30.865 --> 00:01:36.861
The Holy Ghost that He talked
about is the Kundalini within us.

00:01:36.872 --> 00:01:39.372
She is the part of the Holy Ghost,

00:01:39.372 --> 00:01:42.794
or you can say the reflection of the Holy Ghost,

00:01:42.814 --> 00:01:48.994
which exists as all-pervading power.

00:01:49.018 --> 00:01:54.448
Actually the all-pervading power of Divine Love

00:01:54.451 --> 00:02:00.465
is the love of Holy Ghost or Her aura.

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:06.995
This is reflected within us, as the power of desire

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:18.216
as shown in the picture in
the triangular bone of sacrum

00:02:18.207 --> 00:02:21.526
and coils itself in three and a half rounds.

00:02:27.407 --> 00:02:33.047
If you could ask the child to play there,
it would be better. Whose child is this?

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:41.386
Children don't understand all, they
need not understand. They are all right.

00:02:41.386 --> 00:02:45.306
They're realised. They're enjoying themselves.

00:02:53.597 --> 00:02:59.038
This force, which is called as residual force,

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.818
is the desire of God,

00:03:02.796 --> 00:03:13.256
which resides within us in a dormant way.

00:03:13.257 --> 00:03:17.589
We actually do not know what is the desire of God.

00:03:17.606 --> 00:03:19.117
We have our own conclusions,

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.477
our own conceptions,

00:03:20.478 --> 00:03:23.659
our own ideas that I am doing the work of God.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.440
But you are not yet connected with God,

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.440
how can you do the work of God?

00:03:28.425 --> 00:03:30.925
There is no way of really establishing

00:03:30.925 --> 00:03:33.425
any actual rapport with God,

00:03:33.425 --> 00:03:36.380
and how can you say that you are related to God

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.880
or you are doing the work of God?

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.538
It’s all right that God is looking after you,

00:03:42.538 --> 00:03:44.448
He is managing you,

00:03:44.448 --> 00:03:47.110
He has given you this life, is correct.

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:52.062
But there is no way of finding God

00:03:52.068 --> 00:03:54.132
in your conscious mind.

00:03:54.118 --> 00:03:56.618
It's just your mental activity

00:03:56.618 --> 00:03:59.118
maybe your ego,

00:03:59.118 --> 00:04:02.584
which says, "I am God."

00:04:02.578 --> 00:04:06.906
Some people say, "I like it!"

00:04:06.908 --> 00:04:09.408
But why do you like it?

00:04:09.408 --> 00:04:11.516
Because I think, I like it.

00:04:11.548 --> 00:04:15.386
Then, why, whatever you think is your own.

00:04:15.386 --> 00:04:17.056
It is not God’s,

00:04:17.066 --> 00:04:26.786
how do you say, with such cock-sure attitude

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:31.026
that you are connected with God?

00:04:31.031 --> 00:04:33.222
Then they will start discussing about it.

00:04:33.204 --> 00:04:35.704
They sit down and talk about it

00:04:35.704 --> 00:04:39.404
Yesterday only we had a very funny visitor in Paris

00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:43.604
and he started it like a tape record

00:04:43.614 --> 00:04:47.414
and he just started telling Me what he thinks.

00:04:47.426 --> 00:04:50.874
But your thinking is your own imagination.

00:04:50.861 --> 00:04:53.361
There is no actual experience in it.

00:04:53.375 --> 00:04:56.827
There is no actuality.

00:04:56.837 --> 00:05:00.767
I said, "This is fanaticism."

00:05:00.754 --> 00:05:03.254
When you start thinking about something

00:05:03.254 --> 00:05:07.845
and accept it as real, then it is fanaticism,

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:08.855
of any kind.

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:13.667
You can be a football fanatic.

00:05:13.677 --> 00:05:16.427
You think that a particular person must win.

00:05:16.427 --> 00:05:18.927
It becomes sort of your thinking.

00:05:18.927 --> 00:05:21.427
Then that person must win, if he does not win

00:05:21.427 --> 00:05:24.877
then you are going to kill everybody else.

00:05:24.877 --> 00:05:26.997
If you go a little further with it,

00:05:26.997 --> 00:05:35.899
you think that you are a great benevolent person.

00:05:35.896 --> 00:05:37.709
Then whatever you think,

00:05:37.726 --> 00:05:39.069
you feel that this is the thing

00:05:39.019 --> 00:05:42.059
that is going to bring benevolence to people.

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:44.149
but what is the proof?

00:05:44.149 --> 00:05:50.863
That what you think is the thing wanted by God.

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:52.089
All your thinking

00:05:52.089 --> 00:05:58.749
is based either on your conditioning,

00:05:58.739 --> 00:05:59.869
whatever you have read,

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:01.720
if you are born a Christian all your thinking

00:06:01.709 --> 00:06:03.470
will be Christian thinking means church's

00:06:03.459 --> 00:06:05.959
thinking not God's thinking.

00:06:05.964 --> 00:06:09.440
If you are a Hindu, you will think like a Hindu

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.940
of a temple or some sort of a Guru

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.440
or somebody who has taught you something.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:19.161
If you are a Muslim you might become Khomeini

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.700
anything is possible!

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.250
Are we going in the same direction

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.131
with our thinking?

00:06:25.114 --> 00:06:29.121
Or are we related to God?

00:06:29.124 --> 00:06:32.111
First, relationship with God must be established.

00:06:32.111 --> 00:06:34.611
That is extremely important

00:06:34.611 --> 00:06:37.111
before we talk of God

00:06:37.111 --> 00:06:40.874
because all our thinking is our conditioning

00:06:40.874 --> 00:06:44.793
or else our imagination.

00:06:44.784 --> 00:06:46.123
There are some people who met Me

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.243
they said they have met God.

00:06:48.243 --> 00:06:50.743
I said, "Really?  How, how does he look like?"

00:06:50.743 --> 00:06:52.803
"Oh, I met him on the street."

00:06:52.823 --> 00:06:53.853
I said, "Very good."

00:06:53.853 --> 00:06:56.353
And somebody says, "I am Christ."

00:06:56.353 --> 00:06:58.853
Somebody says, "I am Krishna."

00:06:58.853 --> 00:07:03.098
But what is the proof?

00:07:03.093 --> 00:07:05.593
I mean, supposing I say this is gold.

00:07:05.593 --> 00:07:07.848
Then gold has a density.

00:07:07.853 --> 00:07:10.098
You can find out whether it is gold or silver

00:07:10.079 --> 00:07:12.348
or something but you cannot just go on saying,

00:07:12.348 --> 00:07:18.601
“I think it is gold." So it becomes gold, can it?

00:07:18.618 --> 00:07:20.781
In the same way our faith,

00:07:20.778 --> 00:07:24.901
because we think we have a belief in it,

00:07:24.918 --> 00:07:27.961
is mythical – as far as you are concerned,

00:07:27.961 --> 00:07:30.186
as far as anybody else is concerned.

00:07:30.201 --> 00:07:32.701
Unless and until you give the proof of God,

00:07:32.701 --> 00:07:34.876
nobody is going to believe in God any further,

00:07:34.876 --> 00:07:36.596
I can tell you this much.

00:07:36.596 --> 00:07:37.556
And this is the reason

00:07:37.523 --> 00:07:39.616
another mythical stuff is coming up

00:07:39.616 --> 00:07:41.096
is that there is no God.

00:07:41.072 --> 00:07:45.066
This is another myth.

00:07:45.072 --> 00:07:47.572
Either to believe that you are connected with God

00:07:47.572 --> 00:07:50.072
is equally mythical as to say there is no God.

00:07:50.072 --> 00:07:51.756
Because if you have not met Him

00:07:51.692 --> 00:07:53.572
how do you say, there is not? There may be,

00:07:53.549 --> 00:07:57.302
may not be – is a better situation.

00:07:57.308 --> 00:07:59.808
Just to denounce Him that there is no God,

00:07:59.808 --> 00:08:02.308
is another myth.

00:08:02.308 --> 00:08:04.808
We some how or other managed to live with a myth.

00:08:04.808 --> 00:08:08.995
It’s very comfortable to live with myth.

00:08:08.998 --> 00:08:10.745
It’s a comfortable life; we do not want to

00:08:10.726 --> 00:08:12.485
give up our comforts.

00:08:12.485 --> 00:08:14.615
As just now, I was telling someone

00:08:14.615 --> 00:08:18.465
that a little shell contains a little oyster in it.

00:08:18.465 --> 00:08:21.447
Now, the oyster doesn’t want to get out of the shell.

00:08:21.447 --> 00:08:23.947
It’s quite comfortable.

00:08:23.947 --> 00:08:27.815
And a little bit of a sand comes in

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:36.771
and it sat troubling the comfort of the oyster.

00:08:36.785 --> 00:08:41.601
So, oyster takes out his saliva

00:08:41.631 --> 00:08:44.371
goes round it, makes it softer,

00:08:44.371 --> 00:08:47.301
puts it there, curls up a little bit of its body

00:08:47.301 --> 00:08:49.117
and says, “Now I am comfortable now I'm

00:08:49.131 --> 00:08:50.557
very satisfied, it’s all right.

00:08:50.561 --> 00:08:52.537
The shell is the thing for me."

00:08:52.541 --> 00:08:55.041
And that’s how we go on living with the shell

00:08:55.041 --> 00:08:57.917
avoiding understanding

00:08:57.927 --> 00:09:04.037
that this shell is not the thing we are seeking.

00:09:04.057 --> 00:09:08.247
So, one has to get out of that
comfortable feeling one has.

00:09:08.261 --> 00:09:10.761
If you have a house, very nice!

00:09:10.761 --> 00:09:12.726
I’ve got children, very nice!

00:09:12.711 --> 00:09:15.211
I’ve got a wife, I’ve got a car. It's all right.

00:09:15.211 --> 00:09:19.836
I am very comfortable, I am very satisfied.

00:09:22.961 --> 00:09:28.045
But then, certain calamities come in.

00:09:28.035 --> 00:09:31.265
You are faced with them.

00:09:31.261 --> 00:09:34.495
Problems come in

00:09:34.521 --> 00:09:38.967
and then you think,

00:09:38.971 --> 00:09:41.471
"I never waited for this.

00:09:41.487 --> 00:09:43.987
It was most unexpected."

00:09:46.267 --> 00:09:49.568
There are another set of people,

00:09:49.587 --> 00:09:54.618
who think – who ‘think’, again!

00:09:54.627 --> 00:10:02.587
that they have to search God.

00:10:02.607 --> 00:10:09.078
And that’s how they jump into sea.

00:10:09.087 --> 00:10:11.248
They jump into fire,

00:10:11.252 --> 00:10:12.218
they jump into water,

00:10:12.218 --> 00:10:14.118
they jump into all kinds of things

00:10:14.118 --> 00:10:19.309
without understanding what danger it entails.

00:10:19.329 --> 00:10:21.769
So one side we have a comfortably coiled up

00:10:21.759 --> 00:10:23.989
an oyster and another is an oyster

00:10:23.999 --> 00:10:25.809
which is burnt up

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:33.776
which is either drowned or something.

00:10:33.789 --> 00:10:40.126
So what should a human being do?

00:10:40.136 --> 00:10:44.666
He should be comfortable,

00:10:44.666 --> 00:10:46.896
but all the time he should think that

00:10:46.895 --> 00:10:51.176
“I have not yet met God, I must meet.

00:10:51.176 --> 00:10:53.635
I have to watch and see,

00:10:53.645 --> 00:10:57.425
I have to understand."

00:10:57.425 --> 00:10:59.925
Oyster in the shell

00:10:59.925 --> 00:11:03.829
is better sometimes

00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:09.699
than the oyster, which is completely fried out.

00:11:09.699 --> 00:11:12.199
But the oyster in the shell

00:11:12.199 --> 00:11:14.699
will die its own death.

00:11:14.699 --> 00:11:17.654
But there is a possibility about the oyster

00:11:17.654 --> 00:11:20.154
which has come out that he might meet

00:11:20.154 --> 00:11:23.104
something.

00:11:23.093 --> 00:11:26.517
Because he is a seeker

00:11:26.517 --> 00:11:29.937
God also looks after him,

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:34.007
God also wants to help.

00:11:34.027 --> 00:11:36.447
If he could listen to his own unconscious,

00:11:36.467 --> 00:11:39.517
he could work it out.

00:11:42.497 --> 00:11:46.442
Sahaja Yoga is not a new thing.

00:11:46.477 --> 00:11:48.682
Sahaja means ‘spontaneous’.

00:11:48.687 --> 00:11:51.187
Everything that happens in life is spontaneous.

00:11:51.757 --> 00:11:53.797
From amoeba to this stage, you have come

00:11:53.797 --> 00:11:58.427
spontaneously, 'Sahaja,' born with you.

00:11:58.427 --> 00:12:01.727
It is within you!

00:12:06.927 --> 00:12:11.033
Gradually, as a seed sprouts into a flower

00:12:11.033 --> 00:12:13.533
and then the fragrance starts emitting out

00:12:13.533 --> 00:12:14.709
from the flower,

00:12:14.709 --> 00:12:21.553
in the same way it is all built in you.

00:12:21.553 --> 00:12:26.857
You don’t have to go anywhere, it is between

00:12:26.856 --> 00:12:29.997
your own thinking

00:12:30.016 --> 00:12:36.587
and your desiring, it resides.

00:12:39.137 --> 00:12:42.477
You desire something

00:12:42.487 --> 00:12:45.877
and you don’t think about it

00:12:45.897 --> 00:12:48.953
that is the best way you can do.

00:12:48.953 --> 00:12:51.453
We have two capacities within us,

00:12:51.453 --> 00:12:56.000
one is to desire. With this left side,

00:12:56.014 --> 00:13:02.560
the deep blue coloured channel within us,

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:04.720
the desire.

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:06.680
It manifests outside

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:17.254
as left sympathetic nervous system,

00:13:17.234 --> 00:13:21.994
which is our emotional side,

00:13:21.994 --> 00:13:27.154
which is responsible for collecting all our past,

00:13:27.153 --> 00:13:29.387
all our experiences, all our conditioning.

00:13:29.387 --> 00:13:31.364
This is the psyche about which

00:13:31.377 --> 00:13:35.843
the psychologists are worried.

00:13:35.844 --> 00:13:39.033
So, we desire.

00:13:39.023 --> 00:13:43.493
And the right side one, the yellow coloured line

00:13:43.513 --> 00:13:47.523
represents the power by which we maintain

00:13:47.516 --> 00:13:50.016
our physical being

00:13:50.016 --> 00:13:55.970
and ultimately we start thinking.

00:13:55.976 --> 00:13:59.920
Between these two resides

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:02.430
the power of our evolution.

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:06.456
So we have left side and right side

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:08.286
sympathetic nervous system,

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:10.790
manifested in the gross, and in the centre

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:13.586
is the parasympathetic.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.636
Parasympathetic is a system

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:18.130
which shows how much we have evolved so far.

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:20.873
How much we have achieved so far up to

00:14:20.883 --> 00:14:23.753
human level.

00:14:23.776 --> 00:14:26.276
Only human beings think that

00:14:26.276 --> 00:14:32.792
they have to achieve God, not animals.

00:14:32.796 --> 00:14:34.811
They have reached that state that they think

00:14:34.782 --> 00:14:36.315
that they have to achieve God,

00:14:36.312 --> 00:14:39.955
they desire that they have to achieve God.

00:14:39.962 --> 00:14:46.017
There is a gap between their achievement

00:14:46.015 --> 00:14:48.957
and there is the desire.

00:14:48.972 --> 00:14:53.063
This is to be crossed.

00:14:53.063 --> 00:14:58.983
But their desire cannot work it out,

00:14:58.973 --> 00:15:03.303
only their desire can call for the help from God,

00:15:03.303 --> 00:15:05.803
and the God’s desire is within you

00:15:05.803 --> 00:15:10.423
in this triangular bone lying dormant.

00:15:10.433 --> 00:15:15.783
This God’s desire is called as Kundalini.

00:15:15.793 --> 00:15:18.293
That God’s desire has to rise within you,

00:15:18.293 --> 00:15:23.406
and it is He who has to give you the Second Birth

00:15:23.426 --> 00:15:25.416
or you can say that the She, the Mother,

00:15:25.426 --> 00:15:28.734
has to give you the Second Birth.

00:15:28.734 --> 00:15:30.848
This is the Holy Ghost

00:15:30.864 --> 00:15:33.364
about which Christ could not talk

00:15:33.364 --> 00:15:36.958
to those mad people who really crucified Him.

00:15:36.964 --> 00:15:41.638
They were mad that they thought that Christ

00:15:41.648 --> 00:15:47.030
was blasphemous.

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:48.570
Just think of it!

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:50.660
And today we have churches and people,

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:53.160
and this and that.

00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:58.290
When He lived nobody accepted Him,

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:02.480
nobody recognised Him

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.430
When He came, they talked of Moses,

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:08.820
Abraham.

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:11.320
It is very nice to handle Christ,

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:13.550
better talk about them, so that  we don't have

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:16.050
to face reality.

00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:18.550
Because if they had recognised Christ

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:20.222
then Christ would have said, "All right

00:16:20.169 --> 00:16:22.299
if you are recognising Me, then get your

00:16:22.299 --> 00:16:27.329
Realisation

00:16:27.342 --> 00:16:29.726
and understand yourself.”

00:16:29.712 --> 00:16:31.746
They where not prepared for this.

00:16:31.752 --> 00:16:33.976
Only twelve people somehow – you see

00:16:33.962 --> 00:16:36.462
managed to be there, somehow.

00:16:36.462 --> 00:16:42.912
They would not accept Him either.

00:16:42.902 --> 00:16:46.982
Till He was resurrected

00:16:46.972 --> 00:16:51.082
then they accepted Him, in a way.

00:16:51.102 --> 00:16:52.752
And then, what are you going to do

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:56.412
but to create a myth around it.

00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:57.980
And to say that, “Of course,

00:16:57.980 --> 00:16:59.210
we believed in Christ.”

00:16:59.223 --> 00:17:02.426
Now what, which Christ did you believe in?

00:17:02.436 --> 00:17:05.656
Because that Christ, whom you had to face

00:17:05.656 --> 00:17:08.606
you did not face.

00:17:08.596 --> 00:17:12.346
And now you live in imaginary world,

00:17:12.356 --> 00:17:15.096
you have your own paradise about it.

00:17:15.092 --> 00:17:17.826
Where does He live within us?

00:17:17.822 --> 00:17:23.812
Has He created any position within us?

00:17:23.812 --> 00:17:26.612
Is there any meaning to His life,

00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:31.012
which has left a permanent mark within us

00:17:31.012 --> 00:17:33.512
Was He one of the
mile-stones within us?

00:17:33.512 --> 00:17:37.482
If so – where does He reside within us?

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:39.440
How can we be connected to him?

00:17:39.431 --> 00:17:42.790
Nobody made any exploration about it.

00:17:42.803 --> 00:17:46.166
Again the comfortable shell started.

00:17:46.163 --> 00:17:48.066
It has happened not once,

00:17:48.053 --> 00:17:50.236
thousands of years it has been happening,

00:17:50.243 --> 00:17:52.486
whenever an Incarnation came on this Earth

00:17:52.483 --> 00:17:57.066
that’s how they behaved.

00:17:57.073 --> 00:18:00.403
When Rama came they said,
“We believe in Parashurama”,

00:18:00.409 --> 00:18:01.873
when Krishna came they said,

00:18:01.859 --> 00:18:04.153
"We believe in Rama."

00:18:04.139 --> 00:18:08.773
Same thing with Christ, with everyone.

00:18:08.769 --> 00:18:11.269
But you better now recognise

00:18:11.269 --> 00:18:15.859
and know yourself, and face it once for all,

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:17.879
the time has come.

00:18:17.879 --> 00:18:20.860
How long are you going to live with your myths?

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:24.329
The time has come.

00:18:24.323 --> 00:18:31.829
It has nothing to do with
East, West or North and South.

00:18:31.844 --> 00:18:34.344
Most amazing is that in the West,

00:18:34.344 --> 00:18:38.705
people are afraid that this is Eastern knowledge.

00:18:38.724 --> 00:18:41.425
The other day only one lady who is a Realised Soul,

00:18:41.415 --> 00:18:43.265
her son is a Realised Soul.

00:18:43.265 --> 00:18:45.765
They said their teacher was very anxious

00:18:45.765 --> 00:18:48.185
about my son, because he said, "Why are you

00:18:48.185 --> 00:18:50.685
giving this Eastern knowledge to him?"

00:18:50.685 --> 00:18:54.035
How can it be Eastern? It is universal knowledge

00:18:54.035 --> 00:18:56.535
I said, "Why don't you go and ask the teacher

00:18:56.535 --> 00:19:01.400
was Christ born in England or in America?

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:06.180
His cross is even, you can find it

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:14.144
on the airport of London.

00:19:16.118 --> 00:19:18.868
Because I think that Christ was an Englishman.

00:19:19.076 --> 00:19:20.738
So it’s all right, he has to – poor thing

00:19:20.731 --> 00:19:24.646
has to become an Englishman. What to do?

00:19:24.651 --> 00:19:27.866
This knowledge cannot be limited to Indians

00:19:27.836 --> 00:19:30.336
or to English or to anyone.

00:19:30.336 --> 00:19:34.405
It is God’s knowledge, it is for everyone of you

00:19:34.396 --> 00:19:39.376
it is your right to know.

00:19:39.386 --> 00:19:43.686
All of you have got Kundalini.

00:19:43.686 --> 00:19:46.186
You can see with your naked eyes its pulsation;

00:19:46.197 --> 00:19:48.697
you can see its rising.

00:19:48.674 --> 00:19:51.174
You can see its piercing through,

00:19:51.174 --> 00:19:52.906
you can feel it, it throbbing here.

00:19:52.906 --> 00:19:56.271
You can see the piercing.

00:19:56.295 --> 00:19:57.881
You can see, when it pierces through,

00:19:57.891 --> 00:20:01.201
how you become actually collectively conscious.

00:20:01.203 --> 00:20:06.001
You do become.

00:20:06.001 --> 00:20:11.063
It’s a fact! And how can you avoid fact?

00:20:11.054 --> 00:20:13.554
And why should you avoid?

00:20:13.554 --> 00:20:17.144
Because reality is so beautiful,

00:20:17.144 --> 00:20:19.444
why should we be afraid of facing the reality,

00:20:19.444 --> 00:20:21.944
which is so beautiful.

00:20:21.948 --> 00:20:25.454
There was a gentleman in Paris

00:20:25.454 --> 00:20:27.954
who got his Realisation and two days he was

00:20:27.954 --> 00:20:30.253
just laughing out of joy and he said,

00:20:30.253 --> 00:20:32.273
“I’ve never laughed all my life

00:20:32.273 --> 00:20:34.413
as I have laughed now” and just out of joy

00:20:34.413 --> 00:20:36.913
he was laughing;

00:20:36.913 --> 00:20:39.773
so joyous. He said, "Mother let me laugh now

00:20:39.773 --> 00:20:42.603
and enjoy myself, I'm really living."

00:20:42.603 --> 00:20:44.328
Actually he told me that he never believed

00:20:44.338 --> 00:20:46.358
in God, to begin with.

00:20:46.365 --> 00:20:49.353
He thought he was a very rational being.

00:20:49.373 --> 00:20:55.683
I said, rational beings are still half,

00:20:55.703 --> 00:20:57.725
because they are dealing with something

00:20:57.725 --> 00:21:01.520
so limited, is rationality.

00:21:05.925 --> 00:21:09.050
We have to cross these barriers of rationality,

00:21:09.075 --> 00:21:11.575
and something is already within you,

00:21:11.575 --> 00:21:14.075
God has placed within you because it is his

00:21:14.075 --> 00:21:17.419
desire that you should know Him,

00:21:17.419 --> 00:21:19.685
that His power should flow through you

00:21:19.689 --> 00:21:23.315
and that you should be the citizen of His kingdom,

00:21:23.315 --> 00:21:25.585
that He is your generous Father and He's

00:21:25.629 --> 00:21:31.150
and He has made all these arrangements for you.

00:21:31.149 --> 00:21:35.359
Now, 75% people sitting here are Realised Souls.

00:21:35.404 --> 00:21:42.829
I’m so very happy, because I struggled
with six of them for four years.

00:21:42.839 --> 00:21:48.099
It is such a remarkable thing

00:21:48.122 --> 00:21:51.759
but it is very, very hard for people to believe

00:21:51.771 --> 00:21:55.549
that you have to get an experience of God,

00:21:55.549 --> 00:21:59.468
you have to feel Him within yourself.

00:21:59.495 --> 00:22:06.418
As an actualisation, you have to
feel Him in your conscious mind.

00:22:06.438 --> 00:22:09.518
Because if religion gets organised

00:22:09.518 --> 00:22:13.391
you also get beliefs organised.

00:22:13.408 --> 00:22:17.058
Then, whatever they say becomes perfect;

00:22:17.071 --> 00:22:21.976
blind leading the blind.

00:22:23.791 --> 00:22:28.506
You cannot organise God, you cannot.

00:22:28.546 --> 00:22:32.056
He will organise.

00:22:32.076 --> 00:22:35.706
You cannot conceive Him.

00:22:35.726 --> 00:22:39.006
He has to conceive you.

00:22:39.006 --> 00:22:42.156
His Grace must come on you.

00:22:42.166 --> 00:22:46.476
You have to ask for his Grace.

00:22:46.496 --> 00:22:50.496
He has already placed His desire within you.

00:22:50.518 --> 00:22:55.486
And this desire resides as Kundalini.

00:22:55.484 --> 00:22:59.877
You have heard so much about
Kundalini before also, I believe.

00:22:59.877 --> 00:23:01.854
Maybe you must have read some horrible books,

00:23:01.864 --> 00:23:03.674
which are shown, to Me,

00:23:03.694 --> 00:23:05.844
that this Kundalini gives you jerks,

00:23:05.834 --> 00:23:08.334
and you start jumping and you start making

00:23:08.334 --> 00:23:11.649
noises and things like that.

00:23:11.634 --> 00:23:14.134
At the very outset, I must tell you

00:23:14.134 --> 00:23:18.104
that it is the desire of God, which is your Mother.

00:23:18.124 --> 00:23:23.908
And this Mother is your own Mother

00:23:23.941 --> 00:23:26.194
You do not have

00:23:26.201 --> 00:23:28.224
any other Mother but this Mother

00:23:28.224 --> 00:23:32.728
and She does not have any child but you.

00:23:32.729 --> 00:23:34.364
Do you think such a Mother

00:23:34.364 --> 00:23:37.484
who has been waiting to give you this rebirth

00:23:37.484 --> 00:23:41.494
would be in any way troublesome to you?

00:23:41.504 --> 00:23:47.164
Even your physical mother bore all the pains
upon herself to give you birth.

00:23:47.164 --> 00:23:53.007
Then why should this Mother try to trouble you?

00:23:53.007 --> 00:23:58.414
Then people asked Me, "Then how did
these people talk of these things?

00:23:58.414 --> 00:23:59.772
I mean you can talk of anything

00:23:59.747 --> 00:24:03.162
if you want to befool people.

00:24:03.177 --> 00:24:06.407
If you want to befool people, can’t you?

00:24:06.427 --> 00:24:09.617
I mean, if you indulge into such a thing you
can. You can get possessed by somebody

00:24:09.617 --> 00:24:14.386
also, that you start writing all these nonsensical things.

00:24:16.257 --> 00:24:17.877
So many mythical things have been written

00:24:17.835 --> 00:24:21.397
apart from that, those who write that Kundalini
gives you jerks and all that

00:24:21.427 --> 00:24:25.817
maybe the people, who were something like
villagers coming and touching the electricity

00:24:25.817 --> 00:24:32.377
at a wrong point and getting a shock and maligning
the electricity, maybe the unauthorised people,

00:24:32.386 --> 00:24:34.886
who did not know anything about Kundalini.

00:24:34.886 --> 00:24:40.446
For Kundalini can only be awakened by an authorised
person who is authorised by God.

00:24:40.457 --> 00:24:47.967
not by theological college or by any Pandit
or by any Ayurveda school or anything.

00:24:47.975 --> 00:24:51.407
Christ never went to any theological college.

00:24:56.495 --> 00:24:59.467
It cannot be done by any such person

00:24:59.467 --> 00:25:02.877
who says he will read books and raise the Kundalini.

00:25:02.897 --> 00:25:05.397
It’s not the mechanism that works out that way.

00:25:05.397 --> 00:25:08.817
You cannot even sprout a seed by reading.

00:25:08.803 --> 00:25:11.303
Can you?

00:25:11.303 --> 00:25:15.227
You have done nothing living by reading.

00:25:17.483 --> 00:25:22.548
How can you raise Kundalini by reading?

00:25:25.869 --> 00:25:32.955
This is in your every day-to-day life we really
lack sometimes common sense.

00:25:34.274 --> 00:25:40.974
We go and read something,

00:25:40.985 --> 00:25:47.414
we think by reading something we are going
to go to God,

00:25:47.414 --> 00:25:52.906
or we then sit down and discuss about it.

00:25:52.903 --> 00:25:56.743
You cannot do anything by this reading, which
is just a dead thing!

00:25:56.763 --> 00:26:00.983
All your arguments, everything is dead.

00:26:00.977 --> 00:26:05.127
It is not yet enlightened; otherwise every word
could be living.

00:26:05.147 --> 00:26:07.047
That’s the Mantra.

00:26:07.063 --> 00:26:11.397
The word that is living is the Mantra.

00:26:12.851 --> 00:26:16.681
These holy words,

00:26:16.701 --> 00:26:19.201
if spoken by a person who is not enlightened

00:26:19.201 --> 00:26:21.471
has no meaning at all.

00:26:21.481 --> 00:26:24.841
If it is spoken by a person, who is enlightened,

00:26:24.851 --> 00:26:28.071
because enlightenment
means he is related to God

00:26:28.051 --> 00:26:30.551
and he can address to God

00:26:30.551 --> 00:26:33.051
like you get connected.

00:26:37.061 --> 00:26:41.196
All right, if it is done, done, nothing to worry.

00:26:41.205 --> 00:26:43.705
Nothing to feel bad, if some people have been

00:26:43.705 --> 00:26:46.205
very fanatically involved into it,

00:26:46.206 --> 00:26:48.047
it doesn’t matter.

00:26:48.106 --> 00:26:51.457
Makes no difference at all today, I feel.

00:26:51.486 --> 00:26:53.677
All kinds of things, whatever are done are done

00:26:53.687 --> 00:26:55.757
in the past, finished.

00:26:55.757 --> 00:26:58.257
We have to get our Realisation.

00:26:58.257 --> 00:27:00.757
We have to actualise ourselves.

00:27:00.757 --> 00:27:02.142
This is the main point.

00:27:02.142 --> 00:27:04.012
We are seeking ourselves.

00:27:04.012 --> 00:27:05.912
Unless and until you realise yourself

00:27:05.912 --> 00:27:09.002
you don’t have to even believe in Me,

00:27:09.002 --> 00:27:11.502
but you should not deny Me.

00:27:12.866 --> 00:27:19.237
I would not like anybody to believe in Me, blindly,

00:27:19.237 --> 00:27:24.916
because blind people cannot get it.

00:27:24.917 --> 00:27:28.070
But you should not be also closed

00:27:28.077 --> 00:27:32.760
because closed people also cannot get it.

00:27:32.777 --> 00:27:36.539
When you get it then you must believe,

00:27:36.537 --> 00:27:38.696
that is what is called as 'Shraddha.'

00:27:38.687 --> 00:27:41.606
In Sanskrit language, there two things are;

00:27:41.617 --> 00:27:49.225
one is blind faith and another is Shraddha,

00:27:49.225 --> 00:27:53.465
that is faith, pure faith.

00:27:53.465 --> 00:27:57.545
But in English we have to use an adjective

00:27:57.585 --> 00:27:59.925
that blind faith and faith.

00:27:59.935 --> 00:28:02.277
But people are so confused that they forget

00:28:02.275 --> 00:28:03.847
the adjective of blind,

00:28:03.835 --> 00:28:06.477
and they think my faith is... If your faith is that

00:28:06.477 --> 00:28:11.951
one has to accept it.

00:28:11.967 --> 00:28:16.047
But your faith should be such that it is based

00:28:16.057 --> 00:28:22.335
on the truth.

00:28:22.337 --> 00:28:28.295
Then you become an enlightened person.

00:28:28.302 --> 00:28:31.158
After all God has made us into human beings,

00:28:31.162 --> 00:28:33.168
He has given us this nose, eyes, everything.

00:28:33.168 --> 00:28:35.668
We have done nothing about it.

00:28:35.668 --> 00:28:40.971
And if He has made us for a purpose, He is going
to connect us, He is going to do it.

00:28:40.962 --> 00:28:42.125
It’s His job

00:28:42.125 --> 00:28:46.255
If He does not do it, He will have no meaning,
His creation will have no meaning.

00:28:46.255 --> 00:28:49.595
It is His job!

00:28:53.094 --> 00:28:58.098
And besides that somebody else wants to do
it for you, why should you worry?

00:28:58.121 --> 00:29:00.621
Once you get it, you can do it, too.

00:29:00.621 --> 00:29:09.771
Like one light enlightened can
enlighten another light, you can do it.

00:29:09.786 --> 00:29:14.101
Today I wanted to talk a little bit,

00:29:14.131 --> 00:29:18.621
because 75 % are Sahaja Yogis, who are Realised
Souls and who know Sahaja Yoga, they have

00:29:18.632 --> 00:29:23.111
given Realisation to so many, they have cured
people and I mean they are just there.

00:29:23.891 --> 00:29:30.679
And I was very happy that in Paris so many
of them achieved their Nirvikalpa,

00:29:30.681 --> 00:29:35.131
which is... we call as the Doubtless Awareness.

00:29:35.131 --> 00:29:39.741
The first state is the Thoughtless Awareness.

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:44.561
Awareness means, 'Enlightened
Awareness,' you can say,

00:29:44.601 --> 00:29:50.970
'Samadhi' is the one where your awareness
becomes enlightened.

00:29:50.972 --> 00:29:55.157
The first state is of Thoughtless Awareness.

00:29:55.172 --> 00:29:59.067
And then you jump into your Realisation,

00:29:59.077 --> 00:30:03.457
but still the state is not established.

00:30:03.472 --> 00:30:11.222
You mature then as Doubtless Awareness,

00:30:11.234 --> 00:30:17.224
and this Doubtless Awareness is a state, is not
a thing. “Now I have no doubts about Sahaja

00:30:17.234 --> 00:30:21.654
Yoga”, that’s not the way. It's a state,

00:30:21.664 --> 00:30:27.984
where the rhythm of these vibrations,
or the rhythm of these radiations

00:30:27.964 --> 00:30:32.550
achieve a certain depth and a rhythm,

00:30:32.547 --> 00:30:39.417
which then you yourself start seeing that these
doubts are something separate and you build

00:30:39.427 --> 00:30:46.747
up your own reserve against them. It's not
mental state, it is the state of the being.

00:30:46.768 --> 00:30:55.238
You can say a seed becoming a fruit

00:30:55.241 --> 00:30:57.741
and maturing,

00:30:57.741 --> 00:31:00.833
or you can say a flower becoming a fruit

00:31:00.827 --> 00:31:04.863
and then the fruit maturing.

00:31:04.866 --> 00:31:08.057
In this way, first you get your Self Realisation

00:31:08.057 --> 00:31:10.557
and you get your Thoughtless Awareness.

00:31:10.557 --> 00:31:13.737
And then you get your Doubtless Awareness.

00:31:13.725 --> 00:31:16.117
But people who are not complicated so much,

00:31:16.117 --> 00:31:19.327
uncomplicated people, simple people,

00:31:19.307 --> 00:31:22.267
PART OF SHRI MATAJI'S TALK IS MISSING

00:31:22.292 --> 00:31:24.758
chakras are alright,  or not you start verifying it

00:31:24.758 --> 00:31:26.538
through your brain.

00:31:26.548 --> 00:31:29.378
You go round and round and round.

00:31:29.406 --> 00:31:32.878
That's why the first thing you get is...

00:31:32.886 --> 00:31:38.371
your attention gets enlightened.

00:31:38.401 --> 00:31:42.911
You put your attention to someone and you
know about that person on your fingers.

00:31:42.921 --> 00:31:48.311
You can feel their centres and then you know
through decoding what centres.

00:31:48.323 --> 00:31:54.541
Supposing somebody is having a heart-attack
or something you can feel it on this finger,

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:59.538
a heat, or a kind of a spasm,
sometimes and sometimes numbness.

00:31:59.548 --> 00:32:04.857
If a person is going to die, you feel a numbness
in all your fingers. There are many things

00:32:04.877 --> 00:32:09.365
which decode it. Apart from physical
you have got also emotional problems

00:32:09.345 --> 00:32:14.625
which can be found out. The left side suggest
the emotional problem and the right side

00:32:14.619 --> 00:32:17.119
the physical and the mental problem.

00:32:17.119 --> 00:32:19.712
If a person is egoistical,

00:32:19.717 --> 00:32:24.910
if his ego is hurt, anyway if there's a problem
with his ego somehow or other

00:32:24.922 --> 00:32:30.715
in any way, then you get this
finger catching very much.

00:32:30.725 --> 00:32:34.505
But after getting Realisation, you
don't feel bad if somebody says,

00:32:34.503 --> 00:32:37.003
“Mother, my Agnya here is catching.”

00:32:37.003 --> 00:32:39.275
All right, you say it, you don’t feel bad about it.

00:32:39.253 --> 00:32:41.260
You say, "All right, clear it out!"

00:32:41.256 --> 00:32:45.710
This centre is that of Christ.

00:32:45.706 --> 00:32:48.206
Even many people who call themselves Christians

00:32:48.206 --> 00:32:52.210
have the same Agnya as the Jews
have and as the Muslims have.

00:32:52.221 --> 00:32:56.150
One because they are unauthorised

00:32:56.146 --> 00:33:00.228
that’s why Christ is angry, another
because they are criticising Christ.

00:33:00.238 --> 00:33:04.858
Both ways it is just the same.

00:33:04.872 --> 00:33:10.288
Christ wants, or anyone of them, they want
that you should realise them, you should feel

00:33:10.263 --> 00:33:15.438
them, you should know them.

00:33:18.198 --> 00:33:24.498
Today specially for the Sahaja Yogis I
wanted to discuss the right side very much,

00:33:24.522 --> 00:33:31.912
because so far, we have not dealt with it very
much. Normally we got people who were

00:33:31.912 --> 00:33:34.892
on the left side, on the emotional problem.

00:33:34.904 --> 00:33:40.494
The right side is called also as Prana Shakti,

00:33:40.489 --> 00:33:44.879
means the vital power of life.

00:33:44.864 --> 00:33:48.819
And the left side is called as Mana Shakti.

00:33:48.825 --> 00:33:51.325
Now this Prana Shakti,

00:33:51.335 --> 00:33:56.556
which is on the right-hand side...

00:33:56.541 --> 00:33:59.041
What's happened?

00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:03.690
There's some noise somewhere.

00:34:05.555 --> 00:34:08.446
The Prana Shakti within us

00:34:08.462 --> 00:34:13.236
comes to us through five elements.

00:34:13.232 --> 00:34:20.466
The five elements are, as you know,

00:34:20.491 --> 00:34:25.156
is, one of them is the earth,

00:34:25.181 --> 00:34:27.176
then we have got the water,

00:34:27.191 --> 00:34:30.981
then we have got the air,

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.500
then we have got the light

00:34:33.528 --> 00:34:36.028
and then we have got the ether.

00:34:36.028 --> 00:34:38.528
These five elements are there.

00:34:38.553 --> 00:34:44.070
Out of these five elements our body is made.

00:34:44.095 --> 00:34:54.410
These five elements create five cocoons around
us. And that’s how we have got five auras within us.

00:34:54.420 --> 00:35:00.710
These five auras can be
detected by some machines

00:35:00.714 --> 00:35:05.430
because these machines are

00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:14.800
able to detect only the right side

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:18.800
as they deal with matter.

00:35:18.810 --> 00:35:27.685
The whole of the matter is created by these five
energies and they have also a casual energy behind

00:35:27.675 --> 00:35:32.572
it. And these casual energies actually make that.

00:35:32.591 --> 00:35:38.986
For example: the causal
energy of earth is fragrance.

00:35:38.979 --> 00:35:44.432
From the fragrance earth is created.

00:35:44.439 --> 00:35:46.939
Now, within us all these five centres

00:35:46.939 --> 00:35:53.873
that you see

00:35:53.885 --> 00:36:01.963
these are, these five up to
here, are made of five elements.

00:36:01.963 --> 00:36:05.206
The body of those centres are made of

00:36:05.206 --> 00:36:09.378
only the body part, I am saying
– of those five elements.

00:36:09.364 --> 00:36:18.768
And the Deities residing in those centres
are also born from those five elements.

00:36:18.768 --> 00:36:22.968
Because they were born of a particular element,

00:36:22.981 --> 00:36:35.733
they concentrated more on that and maintained
the knowledge more limited to that area,

00:36:35.748 --> 00:36:38.813
which dealt with that particular element.

00:36:38.807 --> 00:36:46.841
For example, we can say the green thing is the
one that represents the water, water element.

00:36:46.853 --> 00:36:53.351
This centre in the stomach is
the water element within us.

00:36:53.356 --> 00:36:56.396
It is called as Nabhi Chakra

00:36:56.406 --> 00:36:59.986
and around it is called as the
Bhavasaghara, you can say the Void

00:36:59.986 --> 00:37:02.276
or you can say the Gap, or whatever you may say,

00:37:02.276 --> 00:37:06.576
the whole world as such, within us.

00:37:06.598 --> 00:37:15.666
So the people who were born on
this centre, around this centre,

00:37:15.646 --> 00:37:22.012
were born out of water element.

00:37:22.012 --> 00:37:28.796
In this Bhavasaghra, Bhavasaghra
means the ocean of this world

00:37:28.806 --> 00:37:36.563
were born, through this ocean of the world,
were born all the Primordial Masters

00:37:36.574 --> 00:37:38.803
one after another,

00:37:38.804 --> 00:37:43.070
we can say Abraham, Moses,

00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:49.780
we had Janaka, we had Adi Nath and Socrates

00:37:49.794 --> 00:37:52.750
and so many others like that

00:37:52.744 --> 00:37:55.244
Nanaka

00:37:55.244 --> 00:37:59.753
and also very recently we
had about hundred years back

00:37:59.763 --> 00:38:03.990
a very great saint born in India known as Sainath.

00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:08.583
They all represent the same
element, that is the water element,

00:38:08.598 --> 00:38:11.098
being responsible or being born out of that

00:38:11.098 --> 00:38:25.259
they are anxious to maintain water element as the
one which is within us for sustaining ourselves.

00:38:25.249 --> 00:38:29.969
We are sustained by water so they
help us to sustain ourselves.

00:38:29.958 --> 00:38:35.122
They are the sustainers, they tell us
how to sustain, as a human being.

00:38:35.119 --> 00:38:42.904
And all of them have tried to establish religion
within us. A religion doesn’t mean outside,

00:38:42.885 --> 00:38:49.835
but the religion as a man, means the capacity
of a man or you can say, the quality of a man.

00:38:49.854 --> 00:38:52.354
What a human being should be like,

00:38:52.354 --> 00:38:56.128
what is the way to know if
he is a human being or not

00:38:56.118 --> 00:38:59.718
which is described in the Ten Commandments.

00:38:59.718 --> 00:39:06.008
Now the way they have said it is all
misinterpreted and all wrong things have come.

00:39:06.027 --> 00:39:11.887
But one thing is definite, that they have never talked of fanaticism.

00:39:11.882 --> 00:39:14.382
They are against fanaticism.

00:39:14.382 --> 00:39:22.315
They are against alcoholism, because
alcohol spoils the water element very much.

00:39:22.339 --> 00:39:28.779
If you see the effect of alcohol on
water in the blood of human beings

00:39:28.789 --> 00:39:30.929
you will be amazed how

00:39:30.925 --> 00:39:34.315
the neutral position of hydrogen
and oxygen are over time

00:39:34.315 --> 00:39:38.395
is absolutely imbalanced by alcohol.

00:39:38.395 --> 00:39:41.094
And water cannot absorb any heat from the liver,

00:39:41.094 --> 00:39:43.594
which sorts out all your poisons.

00:39:43.604 --> 00:39:47.270
And that's how people get bad livers and bad troubles

00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:51.849
and then people would say, "What's wrong?"

00:39:51.849 --> 00:39:55.340
There is nothing wrong as such,
because even nothing wrong in that.

00:39:55.340 --> 00:40:01.079
“What’s wrong according to the theory
of wrong and right of human beings,

00:40:01.089 --> 00:40:04.309
I think nothing is wrong. You can kill
yourself. You can jump from anything.

00:40:04.331 --> 00:40:08.002
You can do whatever you like.

00:40:08.002 --> 00:40:12.032
There is nothing wrong. If you break this, if you
break that, if you break anybody, do anything,

00:40:12.052 --> 00:40:16.972
there is nothing wrong what’s wrong with it?

00:40:16.987 --> 00:40:21.299
But there is fundamentally wrong is
that you are created for a purpose.

00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:23.629
You have not created yourself.

00:40:23.643 --> 00:40:26.979
God has created you with such difficulties.

00:40:27.003 --> 00:40:31.189
He has taken you out of

00:40:31.182 --> 00:40:34.779
so many evolutionary processes
and brought you to this stage

00:40:34.767 --> 00:40:40.599
and now you have no business to
kill yourself and destroy yourself.

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:44.209
This is wrong is that you are destroying
yourself, you are destroying your community

00:40:44.219 --> 00:40:48.469
you are destroying others or
you are destroying yourself.

00:40:48.479 --> 00:40:54.209
If you are destroying yourself also because
you are on your own, you think, "What’s wrong?"

00:40:54.209 --> 00:40:57.519
You are a part and parcel of the whole.

00:40:57.509 --> 00:41:03.289
You are a cell in the whole and
being created to know the whole

00:41:03.279 --> 00:41:06.569
and if you destroy yourself you
are destroying the whole as well.

00:41:06.579 --> 00:41:12.602
You become malignant. You become cancerous

00:41:12.579 --> 00:41:15.079
and that’s why it’s all wrong.

00:41:15.079 --> 00:41:21.388
In anyway if you destroy others or destroy
yourself you have no right to do that.

00:41:21.355 --> 00:41:24.228
God has given you freedom, no doubt.

00:41:24.235 --> 00:41:28.998
By creating ego and superego within
yourself with these activities,

00:41:28.998 --> 00:41:31.268
you become separated from the whole.

00:41:31.263 --> 00:41:34.413
And then you think you are Mr Such and Such.

00:41:34.413 --> 00:41:39.753
And then you stand and say, “I
believe in this, and I believe in...,"

00:41:39.769 --> 00:41:44.179
actually who are you? You are made by God.

00:41:44.189 --> 00:41:46.689
You are His own child.

00:41:46.713 --> 00:41:48.992
Still you are a child.

00:41:48.999 --> 00:41:53.762
It's like a baby saying, "I believe in it, I believe in it."

00:41:55.746 --> 00:41:58.110
You have not known the whole so far.

00:41:58.112 --> 00:42:01.360
How can you say that?

00:42:01.372 --> 00:42:04.870
You have to grow!

00:42:04.882 --> 00:42:08.237
And when you grow, your
freedom is complete,

00:42:08.239 --> 00:42:10.739
absolute.

00:42:10.739 --> 00:42:18.167
But the ideas about this freedom are such
that you are fighting your own innocence

00:42:18.177 --> 00:42:22.007
you are fighting your own sustenance.

00:42:22.017 --> 00:42:30.293
And this sustenance was completely supported

00:42:30.313 --> 00:42:38.603
protected by these great
incarnations of Primordial Masters.

00:42:38.594 --> 00:42:42.437
That’s why they talked against alcohol.

00:42:42.452 --> 00:42:48.072
Christ did not talk about alcohol, all
right – because He was at another point,

00:42:48.072 --> 00:42:51.792
but He did not say that you take alcohol, never.

00:42:51.812 --> 00:42:53.692
People said that He drank wine

00:42:53.692 --> 00:42:57.102
but wine means grape juice in that country,

00:42:57.102 --> 00:42:59.602
it doesn’t mean alcohol.

00:43:02.632 --> 00:43:06.042
How can Christ say, you drink wine,

00:43:06.056 --> 00:43:08.202
which is fermented,

00:43:08.205 --> 00:43:10.152
which will go against your awareness?

00:43:10.152 --> 00:43:12.385
Just think of it!

00:43:12.412 --> 00:43:15.485
It goes against your awareness, isn’t it?

00:43:15.482 --> 00:43:17.685
Your awareness is to be enlightened,

00:43:17.708 --> 00:43:20.208
He came on this earth to enlighten that awareness,

00:43:20.208 --> 00:43:25.241
do you think He will say that you get foggy with it?

00:43:25.218 --> 00:43:29.731
Does it not fog your attention and your awareness,

00:43:29.731 --> 00:43:32.231
is a fact.

00:43:32.231 --> 00:43:37.971
But He wants to do something else

00:43:37.961 --> 00:43:43.907
because He came as Divine Power itself.

00:43:43.988 --> 00:43:46.488
He was the embodiment of Pranava

00:43:46.488 --> 00:43:51.998
not Prana – all powers put together.

00:43:51.996 --> 00:43:57.488
He was the embodiment of OM itself, the Brahma.

00:43:57.500 --> 00:44:00.748
That’s why He came to prove

00:44:00.758 --> 00:44:03.220
what Krishna has said,

00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:06.460
that it cannot be killed by anyone.

00:44:06.473 --> 00:44:08.880
It cannot be blown off,

00:44:08.883 --> 00:44:12.200
it cannot be destroyed.

00:44:12.193 --> 00:44:15.453
His body was made out of that,

00:44:15.473 --> 00:44:20.953
and that’s why He could be resurrected.

00:44:25.303 --> 00:44:26.912
All these things are knowledgeable

00:44:26.912 --> 00:44:28.483
only if you are a realised soul,

00:44:28.483 --> 00:44:32.103
otherwise you cannot understand this.

00:44:32.103 --> 00:44:35.413
Because you have not yet gone into the depth

00:44:35.443 --> 00:44:37.103
of your own understanding,

00:44:37.123 --> 00:44:40.413
you are still children as I say,

00:44:40.403 --> 00:44:43.369
you have to be born again,

00:44:43.383 --> 00:44:50.799
and then you can find out for these vibrations.

00:44:50.782 --> 00:44:54.669
You have to ask just a question,

00:44:54.669 --> 00:45:03.519
“Was Christ embodied with Pranava,

00:45:03.508 --> 00:45:06.544
or the OM, or the Brahma?

00:45:06.539 --> 00:45:11.123
Or was He made of Brahma itself?”

00:45:11.123 --> 00:45:15.733
You will get the cool breeze.

00:45:15.733 --> 00:45:21.063
and that is the sign that He was.

00:45:21.065 --> 00:45:28.375
It is much deeper but the whole
knowledge exists as experience to you.

00:45:28.375 --> 00:45:33.153
The whole of it, it is an experience within us.

00:45:33.145 --> 00:45:37.005
And one has to get that experience of oneself,

00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:39.763
which is knowledge itself

00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:43.999
and then everything trickles down

00:45:43.995 --> 00:45:49.146
just like actual thing within us,
as we see white as white and red as red.

00:45:49.146 --> 00:45:55.476
Animals do not see perhaps,
but human beings do see.

00:45:55.496 --> 00:46:02.976
Thus, our awareness is enlightened.

00:46:02.986 --> 00:46:08.856
I will be talking to other Sahaja Yogis in
the Ashram about the right side later on

00:46:08.879 --> 00:46:12.916
because we have new people, and
they are to be looked after.

00:46:12.954 --> 00:46:21.250
And I think, next time when I
meet, I don’t know when, maybe...

00:46:21.245 --> 00:46:28.025
No, in the Ashram firstly. Thursday evening I think, then
I'll talk to you because Friday I've got to fly out.

00:46:28.017 --> 00:46:31.216
Thursday evening I will
be there most probably.

00:46:34.045 --> 00:46:38.855
So just now, let’s have the
experience for the new ones,

00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:44.035
and for the others also to deepen themselves.
May God bless you.

00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:50.690
All of you should put your
hands just like this, before Me,

00:46:50.701 --> 00:46:56.630
and close your eyes, just close your eyes!

00:46:56.630 --> 00:47:01.919
Put the hands like this, you
see and just close your eyes.

00:47:01.933 --> 00:47:06.310
You have to close your eyes because
the Kundalini, when She rises

00:47:06.273 --> 00:47:08.850
on the Agnya Chakra

00:47:08.854 --> 00:47:11.010
the dilatation of the pupil takes place

00:47:11.014 --> 00:47:14.717
and if your eyes are open the dilatation doesn’t take place.

00:47:14.670 --> 00:47:20.910
When people mesmerize they keep your eyes
open, because they put you on the sides.

00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:26.480
I will tell one day how they mesmerise, also.

00:47:29.144 --> 00:47:34.251
First you will feel that there is no thought
in your mind, if you watch your thoughts.

00:47:34.231 --> 00:47:41.471
Then the Kundalini rises about
Agnya, you get Thoughtless Awareness.

00:47:42.784 --> 00:47:49.621
When it pierces the fontenel bone area, I mean
when you get your baptism by your Kundalini,

00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:57.938
then you feel the kind of a cool
breeze coming towards you from me;

00:47:57.947 --> 00:48:08.017
or a kind of a radiation of cool breeze
coming. From all over you might feel it.

00:48:13.328 --> 00:48:19.389
On your hands! Through
your fingers! It works!

00:48:23.019 --> 00:48:25.529
All of you should put your
hands towards me. Please!

00:48:27.069 --> 00:48:29.569
That's important.

00:48:34.524 --> 00:48:42.210
I mean even to put your hands is hard to
request, that means how egotistical you are.

00:48:42.215 --> 00:48:48.953
You've come here for getting your Realisation
and don't even want to put your hands towards me.

00:48:48.974 --> 00:48:54.409
All such people should leave.

00:48:54.429 --> 00:48:58.634
Getting cool breeze?
Great!

00:48:58.634 --> 00:49:00.732
Close you eyes and enjoy yourself.

00:49:00.734 --> 00:49:05.522
Best is to enjoy, this is the greatest
moment you've been waiting for.

00:49:05.530 --> 00:49:10.280
Close you eyes!
Enjoy yourself!
