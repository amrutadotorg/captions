WEBVTT

00:02.021 --> 00:05.710
I again see today some new faces

00:05.710 --> 00:09.070
who have come here,

00:11.090 --> 00:15.396
and I have to explain again today,

00:15.396 --> 00:20.426
for the first time to them,

00:20.436 --> 00:25.973
what is Sahaja Yoga,

00:25.976 --> 00:30.954
which has been promised in various scriptures

00:30.966 --> 00:37.226
that you have to get your Second Birth.

00:37.247 --> 00:39.747
You have to be born again.

00:39.736 --> 00:43.549
It is said. Christ has said too,

00:43.539 --> 00:46.039
the same thing.

00:48.091 --> 00:52.081
But people have not been able to ponder

00:52.087 --> 00:59.151
on this subject: what does that mean – our Second Birth?

00:59.133 --> 01:03.393
Are we not already born as human beings?

01:03.393 --> 01:06.673
We are born

01:06.683 --> 01:09.135
but the human beings, which are born,

01:09.134 --> 01:12.313
are told that you are to be 'born again.'

01:12.303 --> 01:15.095
Now what are we going to do?

01:15.095 --> 01:20.105
So they asked, "Are we to enter
into our mother's womb again?

01:20.086 --> 01:23.785
And are to be born again?"

01:23.791 --> 01:30.851
He said, :You'll be born of the
Holy Ghost, of the Holy Spirit."

01:30.865 --> 01:36.861
The Holy Ghost that He talked
about is the Kundalini within us.

01:36.872 --> 01:39.372
She is the part of the Holy Ghost,

01:39.372 --> 01:42.794
or you can say the reflection of the Holy Ghost,

01:42.814 --> 01:48.994
which exists as all-pervading power.

01:49.018 --> 01:54.448
Actually the all-pervading power of Divine Love

01:54.451 --> 02:00.465
is the love of Holy Ghost or Her aura.

02:00.459 --> 02:06.995
This is reflected within us, as the power of desire

02:08.819 --> 02:18.216
as shown in the picture in
the triangular bone of sacrum

02:18.207 --> 02:21.526
and coils itself in three and a half rounds.

02:27.407 --> 02:33.047
If you could ask the child to play there,
it would be better. Whose child is this?

02:37.059 --> 02:41.386
Children don't understand all, they
need not understand. They are all right.

02:41.386 --> 02:45.306
They're realised. They're enjoying themselves.

02:53.597 --> 02:59.038
This force, which is called as residual force,

02:59.020 --> 03:02.818
is the desire of God,

03:02.796 --> 03:13.256
which resides within us in a dormant way.

03:13.257 --> 03:17.589
We actually do not know what is the desire of God.

03:17.606 --> 03:19.117
We have our own conclusions,

03:19.110 --> 03:20.477
our own conceptions,

03:20.478 --> 03:23.659
our own ideas that I am doing the work of God.

03:23.690 --> 03:25.440
But you are not yet connected with God,

03:25.440 --> 03:28.440
how can you do the work of God?

03:28.425 --> 03:30.925
There is no way of really establishing

03:30.925 --> 03:33.425
any actual rapport with God,

03:33.425 --> 03:36.380
and how can you say that you are related to God

03:36.380 --> 03:38.880
or you are doing the work of God?

03:38.880 --> 03:42.538
It’s all right that God is looking after you,

03:42.538 --> 03:44.448
He is managing you,

03:44.448 --> 03:47.110
He has given you this life, is correct.

03:47.110 --> 03:52.062
But there is no way of finding God

03:52.068 --> 03:54.132
in your conscious mind.

03:54.118 --> 03:56.618
It's just your mental activity

03:56.618 --> 03:59.118
maybe your ego,

03:59.118 --> 04:02.584
which says, "I am God."

04:02.578 --> 04:06.906
Some people say, "I like it!"

04:06.908 --> 04:09.408
But why do you like it?

04:09.408 --> 04:11.516
Because I think, I like it.

04:11.548 --> 04:15.386
Then, why, whatever you think is your own.

04:15.386 --> 04:17.056
It is not God’s,

04:17.066 --> 04:26.786
how do you say, with such cock-sure attitude

04:26.790 --> 04:31.026
that you are connected with God?

04:31.031 --> 04:33.222
Then they will start discussing about it.

04:33.204 --> 04:35.704
They sit down and talk about it

04:35.704 --> 04:39.404
Yesterday only we had a very funny visitor in Paris

04:39.404 --> 04:43.604
and he started it like a tape record

04:43.614 --> 04:47.414
and he just started telling Me what he thinks.

04:47.426 --> 04:50.874
But your thinking is your own imagination.

04:50.861 --> 04:53.361
There is no actual experience in it.

04:53.375 --> 04:56.827
There is no actuality.

04:56.837 --> 05:00.767
I said, "This is fanaticism."

05:00.754 --> 05:03.254
When you start thinking about something

05:03.254 --> 05:07.845
and accept it as real, then it is fanaticism,

05:07.849 --> 05:08.855
of any kind.

05:08.849 --> 05:13.667
You can be a football fanatic.

05:13.677 --> 05:16.427
You think that a particular person must win.

05:16.427 --> 05:18.927
It becomes sort of your thinking.

05:18.927 --> 05:21.427
Then that person must win, if he does not win

05:21.427 --> 05:24.877
then you are going to kill everybody else.

05:24.877 --> 05:26.997
If you go a little further with it,

05:26.997 --> 05:35.899
you think that you are a great benevolent person.

05:35.896 --> 05:37.709
Then whatever you think,

05:37.726 --> 05:39.069
you feel that this is the thing

05:39.019 --> 05:42.059
that is going to bring benevolence to people.

05:42.069 --> 05:44.149
but what is the proof?

05:44.149 --> 05:50.863
That what you think is the thing wanted by God.

05:50.879 --> 05:52.089
All your thinking

05:52.089 --> 05:58.749
is based either on your conditioning,

05:58.739 --> 05:59.869
whatever you have read,

05:59.879 --> 06:01.720
if you are born a Christian all your thinking

06:01.709 --> 06:03.470
will be Christian thinking means church's

06:03.459 --> 06:05.959
thinking not God's thinking.

06:05.964 --> 06:09.440
If you are a Hindu, you will think like a Hindu

06:09.440 --> 06:11.940
of a temple or some sort of a Guru

06:11.940 --> 06:14.440
or somebody who has taught you something.

06:14.440 --> 06:19.161
If you are a Muslim you might become Khomeini

06:19.200 --> 06:21.700
anything is possible!

06:21.700 --> 06:23.250
Are we going in the same direction

06:23.250 --> 06:25.131
with our thinking?

06:25.114 --> 06:29.121
Or are we related to God?

06:29.124 --> 06:32.111
First, relationship with God must be established.

06:32.111 --> 06:34.611
That is extremely important

06:34.611 --> 06:37.111
before we talk of God

06:37.111 --> 06:40.874
because all our thinking is our conditioning

06:40.874 --> 06:44.793
or else our imagination.

06:44.784 --> 06:46.123
There are some people who met Me

06:46.120 --> 06:48.243
they said they have met God.

06:48.243 --> 06:50.743
I said, "Really?  How, how does he look like?"

06:50.743 --> 06:52.803
"Oh, I met him on the street."

06:52.823 --> 06:53.853
I said, "Very good."

06:53.853 --> 06:56.353
And somebody says, "I am Christ."

06:56.353 --> 06:58.853
Somebody says, "I am Krishna."

06:58.853 --> 07:03.098
But what is the proof?

07:03.093 --> 07:05.593
I mean, supposing I say this is gold.

07:05.593 --> 07:07.848
Then gold has a density.

07:07.853 --> 07:10.098
You can find out whether it is gold or silver

07:10.079 --> 07:12.348
or something but you cannot just go on saying,

07:12.348 --> 07:18.601
“I think it is gold." So it becomes gold, can it?

07:18.618 --> 07:20.781
In the same way our faith,

07:20.778 --> 07:24.901
because we think we have a belief in it,

07:24.918 --> 07:27.961
is mythical – as far as you are concerned,

07:27.961 --> 07:30.186
as far as anybody else is concerned.

07:30.201 --> 07:32.701
Unless and until you give the proof of God,

07:32.701 --> 07:34.876
nobody is going to believe in God any further,

07:34.876 --> 07:36.596
I can tell you this much.

07:36.596 --> 07:37.556
And this is the reason

07:37.523 --> 07:39.616
another mythical stuff is coming up

07:39.616 --> 07:41.096
is that there is no God.

07:41.072 --> 07:45.066
This is another myth.

07:45.072 --> 07:47.572
Either to believe that you are connected with God

07:47.572 --> 07:50.072
is equally mythical as to say there is no God.

07:50.072 --> 07:51.756
Because if you have not met Him

07:51.692 --> 07:53.572
how do you say, there is not? There may be,

07:53.549 --> 07:57.302
may not be – is a better situation.

07:57.308 --> 07:59.808
Just to denounce Him that there is no God,

07:59.808 --> 08:02.308
is another myth.

08:02.308 --> 08:04.808
We some how or other managed to live with a myth.

08:04.808 --> 08:08.995
It’s very comfortable to live with myth.

08:08.998 --> 08:10.745
It’s a comfortable life; we do not want to

08:10.726 --> 08:12.485
give up our comforts.

08:12.485 --> 08:14.615
As just now, I was telling someone

08:14.615 --> 08:18.465
that a little shell contains a little oyster in it.

08:18.465 --> 08:21.447
Now, the oyster doesn’t want to get out of the shell.

08:21.447 --> 08:23.947
It’s quite comfortable.

08:23.947 --> 08:27.815
And a little bit of a sand comes in

08:27.820 --> 08:36.771
and it sat troubling the comfort of the oyster.

08:36.785 --> 08:41.601
So, oyster takes out his saliva

08:41.631 --> 08:44.371
goes round it, makes it softer,

08:44.371 --> 08:47.301
puts it there, curls up a little bit of its body

08:47.301 --> 08:49.117
and says, “Now I am comfortable now I'm

08:49.131 --> 08:50.557
very satisfied, it’s all right.

08:50.561 --> 08:52.537
The shell is the thing for me."

08:52.541 --> 08:55.041
And that’s how we go on living with the shell

08:55.041 --> 08:57.917
avoiding understanding

08:57.927 --> 09:04.037
that this shell is not the thing we are seeking.

09:04.057 --> 09:08.247
So, one has to get out of that
comfortable feeling one has.

09:08.261 --> 09:10.761
If you have a house, very nice!

09:10.761 --> 09:12.726
I’ve got children, very nice!

09:12.711 --> 09:15.211
I’ve got a wife, I’ve got a car. It's all right.

09:15.211 --> 09:19.836
I am very comfortable, I am very satisfied.

09:22.961 --> 09:28.045
But then, certain calamities come in.

09:28.035 --> 09:31.265
You are faced with them.

09:31.261 --> 09:34.495
Problems come in

09:34.521 --> 09:38.967
and then you think,

09:38.971 --> 09:41.471
"I never waited for this.

09:41.487 --> 09:43.987
It was most unexpected."

09:46.267 --> 09:49.568
There are another set of people,

09:49.587 --> 09:54.618
who think – who ‘think’, again!

09:54.627 --> 10:02.587
that they have to search God.

10:02.607 --> 10:09.078
And that’s how they jump into sea.

10:09.087 --> 10:11.248
They jump into fire,

10:11.252 --> 10:12.218
they jump into water,

10:12.218 --> 10:14.118
they jump into all kinds of things

10:14.118 --> 10:19.309
without understanding what danger it entails.

10:19.329 --> 10:21.769
So one side we have a comfortably coiled up

10:21.759 --> 10:23.989
an oyster and another is an oyster

10:23.999 --> 10:25.809
which is burnt up

10:25.780 --> 10:33.776
which is either drowned or something.

10:33.789 --> 10:40.126
So what should a human being do?

10:40.136 --> 10:44.666
He should be comfortable,

10:44.666 --> 10:46.896
but all the time he should think that

10:46.895 --> 10:51.176
“I have not yet met God, I must meet.

10:51.176 --> 10:53.635
I have to watch and see,

10:53.645 --> 10:57.425
I have to understand."

10:57.425 --> 10:59.925
Oyster in the shell

10:59.925 --> 11:03.829
is better sometimes

11:03.829 --> 11:09.699
than the oyster, which is completely fried out.

11:09.699 --> 11:12.199
But the oyster in the shell

11:12.199 --> 11:14.699
will die its own death.

11:14.699 --> 11:17.654
But there is a possibility about the oyster

11:17.654 --> 11:20.154
which has come out that he might meet

11:20.154 --> 11:23.104
something.

11:23.093 --> 11:26.517
Because he is a seeker

11:26.517 --> 11:29.937
God also looks after him,

11:29.960 --> 11:34.007
God also wants to help.

11:34.027 --> 11:36.447
If he could listen to his own unconscious,

11:36.467 --> 11:39.517
he could work it out.

11:42.497 --> 11:46.442
Sahaja Yoga is not a new thing.

11:46.477 --> 11:48.682
Sahaja means ‘spontaneous’.

11:48.687 --> 11:51.187
Everything that happens in life is spontaneous.

11:51.757 --> 11:53.797
From amoeba to this stage, you have come

11:53.797 --> 11:58.427
spontaneously, 'Sahaja,' born with you.

11:58.427 --> 12:01.727
It is within you!

12:06.927 --> 12:11.033
Gradually, as a seed sprouts into a flower

12:11.033 --> 12:13.533
and then the fragrance starts emitting out

12:13.533 --> 12:14.709
from the flower,

12:14.709 --> 12:21.553
in the same way it is all built in you.

12:21.553 --> 12:26.857
You don’t have to go anywhere, it is between

12:26.856 --> 12:29.997
your own thinking

12:30.016 --> 12:36.587
and your desiring, it resides.

12:39.137 --> 12:42.477
You desire something

12:42.487 --> 12:45.877
and you don’t think about it

12:45.897 --> 12:48.953
that is the best way you can do.

12:48.953 --> 12:51.453
We have two capacities within us,

12:51.453 --> 12:56.000
one is to desire. With this left side,

12:56.014 --> 13:02.560
the deep blue coloured channel within us,

13:02.570 --> 13:04.720
the desire.

13:04.740 --> 13:06.680
It manifests outside

13:06.680 --> 13:17.254
as left sympathetic nervous system,

13:17.234 --> 13:21.994
which is our emotional side,

13:21.994 --> 13:27.154
which is responsible for collecting all our past,

13:27.153 --> 13:29.387
all our experiences, all our conditioning.

13:29.387 --> 13:31.364
This is the psyche about which

13:31.377 --> 13:35.843
the psychologists are worried.

13:35.844 --> 13:39.033
So, we desire.

13:39.023 --> 13:43.493
And the right side one, the yellow coloured line

13:43.513 --> 13:47.523
represents the power by which we maintain

13:47.516 --> 13:50.016
our physical being

13:50.016 --> 13:55.970
and ultimately we start thinking.

13:55.976 --> 13:59.920
Between these two resides

13:59.920 --> 14:02.430
the power of our evolution.

14:04.510 --> 14:06.456
So we have left side and right side

14:06.490 --> 14:08.286
sympathetic nervous system,

14:08.290 --> 14:10.790
manifested in the gross, and in the centre

14:10.790 --> 14:13.586
is the parasympathetic.

14:13.600 --> 14:15.636
Parasympathetic is a system

14:15.630 --> 14:18.130
which shows how much we have evolved so far.

14:18.130 --> 14:20.873
How much we have achieved so far up to

14:20.883 --> 14:23.753
human level.

14:23.776 --> 14:26.276
Only human beings think that

14:26.276 --> 14:32.792
they have to achieve God, not animals.

14:32.796 --> 14:34.811
They have reached that state that they think

14:34.782 --> 14:36.315
that they have to achieve God,

14:36.312 --> 14:39.955
they desire that they have to achieve God.

14:39.962 --> 14:46.017
There is a gap between their achievement

14:46.015 --> 14:48.957
and there is the desire.

14:48.972 --> 14:53.063
This is to be crossed.

14:53.063 --> 14:58.983
But their desire cannot work it out,

14:58.973 --> 15:03.303
only their desire can call for the help from God,

15:03.303 --> 15:05.803
and the God’s desire is within you

15:05.803 --> 15:10.423
in this triangular bone lying dormant.

15:10.433 --> 15:15.783
This God’s desire is called as Kundalini.

15:15.793 --> 15:18.293
That God’s desire has to rise within you,

15:18.293 --> 15:23.406
and it is He who has to give you the Second Birth

15:23.426 --> 15:25.416
or you can say that the She, the Mother,

15:25.426 --> 15:28.734
has to give you the Second Birth.

15:28.734 --> 15:30.848
This is the Holy Ghost

15:30.864 --> 15:33.364
about which Christ could not talk

15:33.364 --> 15:36.958
to those mad people who really crucified Him.

15:36.964 --> 15:41.638
They were mad that they thought that Christ

15:41.648 --> 15:47.030
was blasphemous.

15:47.030 --> 15:48.570
Just think of it!

15:48.570 --> 15:50.660
And today we have churches and people,

15:50.660 --> 15:53.160
and this and that.

15:56.250 --> 15:58.290
When He lived nobody accepted Him,

15:58.290 --> 16:02.480
nobody recognised Him

16:02.480 --> 16:04.430
When He came, they talked of Moses,

16:04.430 --> 16:08.820
Abraham.

16:08.820 --> 16:11.320
It is very nice to handle Christ,

16:11.290 --> 16:13.550
better talk about them, so that  we don't have

16:13.550 --> 16:16.050
to face reality.

16:16.050 --> 16:18.550
Because if they had recognised Christ

16:18.550 --> 16:20.222
then Christ would have said, "All right

16:20.169 --> 16:22.299
if you are recognising Me, then get your

16:22.299 --> 16:27.329
Realisation

16:27.342 --> 16:29.726
and understand yourself.”

16:29.712 --> 16:31.746
They where not prepared for this.

16:31.752 --> 16:33.976
Only twelve people somehow – you see

16:33.962 --> 16:36.462
managed to be there, somehow.

16:36.462 --> 16:42.912
They would not accept Him either.

16:42.902 --> 16:46.982
Till He was resurrected

16:46.972 --> 16:51.082
then they accepted Him, in a way.

16:51.102 --> 16:52.752
And then, what are you going to do

16:52.760 --> 16:56.412
but to create a myth around it.

16:56.420 --> 16:57.980
And to say that, “Of course,

16:57.980 --> 16:59.210
we believed in Christ.”

16:59.223 --> 17:02.426
Now what, which Christ did you believe in?

17:02.436 --> 17:05.656
Because that Christ, whom you had to face

17:05.656 --> 17:08.606
you did not face.

17:08.596 --> 17:12.346
And now you live in imaginary world,

17:12.356 --> 17:15.096
you have your own paradise about it.

17:15.092 --> 17:17.826
Where does He live within us?

17:17.822 --> 17:23.812
Has He created any position within us?

17:23.812 --> 17:26.612
Is there any meaning to His life,

17:26.619 --> 17:31.012
which has left a permanent mark within us

17:31.012 --> 17:33.512
Was He one of the
mile-stones within us?

17:33.512 --> 17:37.482
If so – where does He reside within us?

17:37.490 --> 17:39.440
How can we be connected to him?

17:39.431 --> 17:42.790
Nobody made any exploration about it.

17:42.803 --> 17:46.166
Again the comfortable shell started.

17:46.163 --> 17:48.066
It has happened not once,

17:48.053 --> 17:50.236
thousands of years it has been happening,

17:50.243 --> 17:52.486
whenever an Incarnation came on this Earth

17:52.483 --> 17:57.066
that’s how they behaved.

17:57.073 --> 18:00.403
When Rama came they said,
“We believe in Parashurama”,

18:00.409 --> 18:01.873
when Krishna came they said,

18:01.859 --> 18:04.153
"We believe in Rama."

18:04.139 --> 18:08.773
Same thing with Christ, with everyone.

18:08.769 --> 18:11.269
But you better now recognise

18:11.269 --> 18:15.859
and know yourself, and face it once for all,

18:15.860 --> 18:17.879
the time has come.

18:17.879 --> 18:20.860
How long are you going to live with your myths?

18:20.860 --> 18:24.329
The time has come.

18:24.323 --> 18:31.829
It has nothing to do with
East, West or North and South.

18:31.844 --> 18:34.344
Most amazing is that in the West,

18:34.344 --> 18:38.705
people are afraid that this is Eastern knowledge.

18:38.724 --> 18:41.425
The other day only one lady who is a Realised Soul,

18:41.415 --> 18:43.265
her son is a Realised Soul.

18:43.265 --> 18:45.765
They said their teacher was very anxious

18:45.765 --> 18:48.185
about my son, because he said, "Why are you

18:48.185 --> 18:50.685
giving this Eastern knowledge to him?"

18:50.685 --> 18:54.035
How can it be Eastern? It is universal knowledge

18:54.035 --> 18:56.535
I said, "Why don't you go and ask the teacher

18:56.535 --> 19:01.400
was Christ born in England or in America?

19:03.680 --> 19:06.180
His cross is even, you can find it

19:06.180 --> 19:14.144
on the airport of London.

19:16.118 --> 19:18.868
Because I think that Christ was an Englishman.

19:19.076 --> 19:20.738
So it’s all right, he has to – poor thing

19:20.731 --> 19:24.646
has to become an Englishman. What to do?

19:24.651 --> 19:27.866
This knowledge cannot be limited to Indians

19:27.836 --> 19:30.336
or to English or to anyone.

19:30.336 --> 19:34.405
It is God’s knowledge, it is for everyone of you

19:34.396 --> 19:39.376
it is your right to know.

19:39.386 --> 19:43.686
All of you have got Kundalini.

19:43.686 --> 19:46.186
You can see with your naked eyes its pulsation;

19:46.197 --> 19:48.697
you can see its rising.

19:48.674 --> 19:51.174
You can see its piercing through,

19:51.174 --> 19:52.906
you can feel it, it throbbing here.

19:52.906 --> 19:56.271
You can see the piercing.

19:56.295 --> 19:57.881
You can see, when it pierces through,

19:57.891 --> 20:01.201
how you become actually collectively conscious.

20:01.203 --> 20:06.001
You do become.

20:06.001 --> 20:11.063
It’s a fact! And how can you avoid fact?

20:11.054 --> 20:13.554
And why should you avoid?

20:13.554 --> 20:17.144
Because reality is so beautiful,

20:17.144 --> 20:19.444
why should we be afraid of facing the reality,

20:19.444 --> 20:21.944
which is so beautiful.

20:21.948 --> 20:25.454
There was a gentleman in Paris

20:25.454 --> 20:27.954
who got his Realisation and two days he was

20:27.954 --> 20:30.253
just laughing out of joy and he said,

20:30.253 --> 20:32.273
“I’ve never laughed all my life

20:32.273 --> 20:34.413
as I have laughed now” and just out of joy

20:34.413 --> 20:36.913
he was laughing;

20:36.913 --> 20:39.773
so joyous. He said, "Mother let me laugh now

20:39.773 --> 20:42.603
and enjoy myself, I'm really living."

20:42.603 --> 20:44.328
Actually he told me that he never believed

20:44.338 --> 20:46.358
in God, to begin with.

20:46.365 --> 20:49.353
He thought he was a very rational being.

20:49.373 --> 20:55.683
I said, rational beings are still half,

20:55.703 --> 20:57.725
because they are dealing with something

20:57.725 --> 21:01.520
so limited, is rationality.

21:05.925 --> 21:09.050
We have to cross these barriers of rationality,

21:09.075 --> 21:11.575
and something is already within you,

21:11.575 --> 21:14.075
God has placed within you because it is his

21:14.075 --> 21:17.419
desire that you should know Him,

21:17.419 --> 21:19.685
that His power should flow through you

21:19.689 --> 21:23.315
and that you should be the citizen of His kingdom,

21:23.315 --> 21:25.585
that He is your generous Father and He's

21:25.629 --> 21:31.150
and He has made all these arrangements for you.

21:31.149 --> 21:35.359
Now, 75% people sitting here are Realised Souls.

21:35.404 --> 21:42.829
I’m so very happy, because I struggled
with six of them for four years.

21:42.839 --> 21:48.099
It is such a remarkable thing

21:48.122 --> 21:51.759
but it is very, very hard for people to believe

21:51.771 --> 21:55.549
that you have to get an experience of God,

21:55.549 --> 21:59.468
you have to feel Him within yourself.

21:59.495 --> 22:06.418
As an actualisation, you have to
feel Him in your conscious mind.

22:06.438 --> 22:09.518
Because if religion gets organised

22:09.518 --> 22:13.391
you also get beliefs organised.

22:13.408 --> 22:17.058
Then, whatever they say becomes perfect;

22:17.071 --> 22:21.976
blind leading the blind.

22:23.791 --> 22:28.506
You cannot organise God, you cannot.

22:28.546 --> 22:32.056
He will organise.

22:32.076 --> 22:35.706
You cannot conceive Him.

22:35.726 --> 22:39.006
He has to conceive you.

22:39.006 --> 22:42.156
His Grace must come on you.

22:42.166 --> 22:46.476
You have to ask for his Grace.

22:46.496 --> 22:50.496
He has already placed His desire within you.

22:50.518 --> 22:55.486
And this desire resides as Kundalini.

22:55.484 --> 22:59.877
You have heard so much about
Kundalini before also, I believe.

22:59.877 --> 23:01.854
Maybe you must have read some horrible books,

23:01.864 --> 23:03.674
which are shown, to Me,

23:03.694 --> 23:05.844
that this Kundalini gives you jerks,

23:05.834 --> 23:08.334
and you start jumping and you start making

23:08.334 --> 23:11.649
noises and things like that.

23:11.634 --> 23:14.134
At the very outset, I must tell you

23:14.134 --> 23:18.104
that it is the desire of God, which is your Mother.

23:18.124 --> 23:23.908
And this Mother is your own Mother

23:23.941 --> 23:26.194
You do not have

23:26.201 --> 23:28.224
any other Mother but this Mother

23:28.224 --> 23:32.728
and She does not have any child but you.

23:32.729 --> 23:34.364
Do you think such a Mother

23:34.364 --> 23:37.484
who has been waiting to give you this rebirth

23:37.484 --> 23:41.494
would be in any way troublesome to you?

23:41.504 --> 23:47.164
Even your physical mother bore all the pains
upon herself to give you birth.

23:47.164 --> 23:53.007
Then why should this Mother try to trouble you?

23:53.007 --> 23:58.414
Then people asked Me, "Then how did
these people talk of these things?

23:58.414 --> 23:59.772
I mean you can talk of anything

23:59.747 --> 24:03.162
if you want to befool people.

24:03.177 --> 24:06.407
If you want to befool people, can’t you?

24:06.427 --> 24:09.617
I mean, if you indulge into such a thing you
can. You can get possessed by somebody

24:09.617 --> 24:14.386
also, that you start writing all these nonsensical things.

24:16.257 --> 24:17.877
So many mythical things have been written

24:17.835 --> 24:21.397
apart from that, those who write that Kundalini
gives you jerks and all that

24:21.427 --> 24:25.817
maybe the people, who were something like
villagers coming and touching the electricity

24:25.817 --> 24:32.377
at a wrong point and getting a shock and maligning
the electricity, maybe the unauthorised people,

24:32.386 --> 24:34.886
who did not know anything about Kundalini.

24:34.886 --> 24:40.446
For Kundalini can only be awakened by an authorised
person who is authorised by God.

24:40.457 --> 24:47.967
not by theological college or by any Pandit
or by any Ayurveda school or anything.

24:47.975 --> 24:51.407
Christ never went to any theological college.

24:56.495 --> 24:59.467
It cannot be done by any such person

24:59.467 --> 25:02.877
who says he will read books and raise the Kundalini.

25:02.897 --> 25:05.397
It’s not the mechanism that works out that way.

25:05.397 --> 25:08.817
You cannot even sprout a seed by reading.

25:08.803 --> 25:11.303
Can you?

25:11.303 --> 25:15.227
You have done nothing living by reading.

25:17.483 --> 25:22.548
How can you raise Kundalini by reading?

25:25.869 --> 25:32.955
This is in your every day-to-day life we really
lack sometimes common sense.

25:34.274 --> 25:40.974
We go and read something,

25:40.985 --> 25:47.414
we think by reading something we are going
to go to God,

25:47.414 --> 25:52.906
or we then sit down and discuss about it.

25:52.903 --> 25:56.743
You cannot do anything by this reading, which
is just a dead thing!

25:56.763 --> 26:00.983
All your arguments, everything is dead.

26:00.977 --> 26:05.127
It is not yet enlightened; otherwise every word
could be living.

26:05.147 --> 26:07.047
That’s the Mantra.

26:07.063 --> 26:11.397
The word that is living is the Mantra.

26:12.851 --> 26:16.681
These holy words,

26:16.701 --> 26:19.201
if spoken by a person who is not enlightened

26:19.201 --> 26:21.471
has no meaning at all.

26:21.481 --> 26:24.841
If it is spoken by a person, who is enlightened,

26:24.851 --> 26:28.071
because enlightenment
means he is related to God

26:28.051 --> 26:30.551
and he can address to God

26:30.551 --> 26:33.051
like you get connected.

26:37.061 --> 26:41.196
All right, if it is done, done, nothing to worry.

26:41.205 --> 26:43.705
Nothing to feel bad, if some people have been

26:43.705 --> 26:46.205
very fanatically involved into it,

26:46.206 --> 26:48.047
it doesn’t matter.

26:48.106 --> 26:51.457
Makes no difference at all today, I feel.

26:51.486 --> 26:53.677
All kinds of things, whatever are done are done

26:53.687 --> 26:55.757
in the past, finished.

26:55.757 --> 26:58.257
We have to get our Realisation.

26:58.257 --> 27:00.757
We have to actualise ourselves.

27:00.757 --> 27:02.142
This is the main point.

27:02.142 --> 27:04.012
We are seeking ourselves.

27:04.012 --> 27:05.912
Unless and until you realise yourself

27:05.912 --> 27:09.002
you don’t have to even believe in Me,

27:09.002 --> 27:11.502
but you should not deny Me.

27:12.866 --> 27:19.237
I would not like anybody to believe in Me, blindly,

27:19.237 --> 27:24.916
because blind people cannot get it.

27:24.917 --> 27:28.070
But you should not be also closed

27:28.077 --> 27:32.760
because closed people also cannot get it.

27:32.777 --> 27:36.539
When you get it then you must believe,

27:36.537 --> 27:38.696
that is what is called as 'Shraddha.'

27:38.687 --> 27:41.606
In Sanskrit language, there two things are;

27:41.617 --> 27:49.225
one is blind faith and another is Shraddha,

27:49.225 --> 27:53.465
that is faith, pure faith.

27:53.465 --> 27:57.545
But in English we have to use an adjective

27:57.585 --> 27:59.925
that blind faith and faith.

27:59.935 --> 28:02.277
But people are so confused that they forget

28:02.275 --> 28:03.847
the adjective of blind,

28:03.835 --> 28:06.477
and they think my faith is... If your faith is that

28:06.477 --> 28:11.951
one has to accept it.

28:11.967 --> 28:16.047
But your faith should be such that it is based

28:16.057 --> 28:22.335
on the truth.

28:22.337 --> 28:28.295
Then you become an enlightened person.

28:28.302 --> 28:31.158
After all God has made us into human beings,

28:31.162 --> 28:33.168
He has given us this nose, eyes, everything.

28:33.168 --> 28:35.668
We have done nothing about it.

28:35.668 --> 28:40.971
And if He has made us for a purpose, He is going
to connect us, He is going to do it.

28:40.962 --> 28:42.125
It’s His job

28:42.125 --> 28:46.255
If He does not do it, He will have no meaning,
His creation will have no meaning.

28:46.255 --> 28:49.595
It is His job!

28:53.094 --> 28:58.098
And besides that somebody else wants to do
it for you, why should you worry?

28:58.121 --> 29:00.621
Once you get it, you can do it, too.

29:00.621 --> 29:09.771
Like one light enlightened can
enlighten another light, you can do it.

29:09.786 --> 29:14.101
Today I wanted to talk a little bit,

29:14.131 --> 29:18.621
because 75 % are Sahaja Yogis, who are Realised
Souls and who know Sahaja Yoga, they have

29:18.632 --> 29:23.111
given Realisation to so many, they have cured
people and I mean they are just there.

29:23.891 --> 29:30.679
And I was very happy that in Paris so many
of them achieved their Nirvikalpa,

29:30.681 --> 29:35.131
which is... we call as the Doubtless Awareness.

29:35.131 --> 29:39.741
The first state is the Thoughtless Awareness.

29:39.750 --> 29:44.561
Awareness means, 'Enlightened
Awareness,' you can say,

29:44.601 --> 29:50.970
'Samadhi' is the one where your awareness
becomes enlightened.

29:50.972 --> 29:55.157
The first state is of Thoughtless Awareness.

29:55.172 --> 29:59.067
And then you jump into your Realisation,

29:59.077 --> 30:03.457
but still the state is not established.

30:03.472 --> 30:11.222
You mature then as Doubtless Awareness,

30:11.234 --> 30:17.224
and this Doubtless Awareness is a state, is not
a thing. “Now I have no doubts about Sahaja

30:17.234 --> 30:21.654
Yoga”, that’s not the way. It's a state,

30:21.664 --> 30:27.984
where the rhythm of these vibrations,
or the rhythm of these radiations

30:27.964 --> 30:32.550
achieve a certain depth and a rhythm,

30:32.547 --> 30:39.417
which then you yourself start seeing that these
doubts are something separate and you build

30:39.427 --> 30:46.747
up your own reserve against them. It's not
mental state, it is the state of the being.

30:46.768 --> 30:55.238
You can say a seed becoming a fruit

30:55.241 --> 30:57.741
and maturing,

30:57.741 --> 31:00.833
or you can say a flower becoming a fruit

31:00.827 --> 31:04.863
and then the fruit maturing.

31:04.866 --> 31:08.057
In this way, first you get your Self Realisation

31:08.057 --> 31:10.557
and you get your Thoughtless Awareness.

31:10.557 --> 31:13.737
And then you get your Doubtless Awareness.

31:13.725 --> 31:16.117
But people who are not complicated so much,

31:16.117 --> 31:19.327
uncomplicated people, simple people,

31:19.307 --> 31:22.267
PART OF SHRI MATAJI'S TALK IS MISSING

31:22.292 --> 31:24.758
chakras are alright,  or not you start verifying it

31:24.758 --> 31:26.538
through your brain.

31:26.548 --> 31:29.378
You go round and round and round.

31:29.406 --> 31:32.878
That's why the first thing you get is...

31:32.886 --> 31:38.371
your attention gets enlightened.

31:38.401 --> 31:42.911
You put your attention to someone and you
know about that person on your fingers.

31:42.921 --> 31:48.311
You can feel their centres and then you know
through decoding what centres.

31:48.323 --> 31:54.541
Supposing somebody is having a heart-attack
or something you can feel it on this finger,

31:54.560 --> 31:59.538
a heat, or a kind of a spasm,
sometimes and sometimes numbness.

31:59.548 --> 32:04.857
If a person is going to die, you feel a numbness
in all your fingers. There are many things

32:04.877 --> 32:09.365
which decode it. Apart from physical
you have got also emotional problems

32:09.345 --> 32:14.625
which can be found out. The left side suggest
the emotional problem and the right side

32:14.619 --> 32:17.119
the physical and the mental problem.

32:17.119 --> 32:19.712
If a person is egoistical,

32:19.717 --> 32:24.910
if his ego is hurt, anyway if there's a problem
with his ego somehow or other

32:24.922 --> 32:30.715
in any way, then you get this
finger catching very much.

32:30.725 --> 32:34.505
But after getting Realisation, you
don't feel bad if somebody says,

32:34.503 --> 32:37.003
“Mother, my Agnya here is catching.”

32:37.003 --> 32:39.275
All right, you say it, you don’t feel bad about it.

32:39.253 --> 32:41.260
You say, "All right, clear it out!"

32:41.256 --> 32:45.710
This centre is that of Christ.

32:45.706 --> 32:48.206
Even many people who call themselves Christians

32:48.206 --> 32:52.210
have the same Agnya as the Jews
have and as the Muslims have.

32:52.221 --> 32:56.150
One because they are unauthorised

32:56.146 --> 33:00.228
that’s why Christ is angry, another
because they are criticising Christ.

33:00.238 --> 33:04.858
Both ways it is just the same.

33:04.872 --> 33:10.288
Christ wants, or anyone of them, they want
that you should realise them, you should feel

33:10.263 --> 33:15.438
them, you should know them.

33:18.198 --> 33:24.498
Today specially for the Sahaja Yogis I
wanted to discuss the right side very much,

33:24.522 --> 33:31.912
because so far, we have not dealt with it very
much. Normally we got people who were

33:31.912 --> 33:34.892
on the left side, on the emotional problem.

33:34.904 --> 33:40.494
The right side is called also as Prana Shakti,

33:40.489 --> 33:44.879
means the vital power of life.

33:44.864 --> 33:48.819
And the left side is called as Mana Shakti.

33:48.825 --> 33:51.325
Now this Prana Shakti,

33:51.335 --> 33:56.556
which is on the right-hand side...

33:56.541 --> 33:59.041
What's happened?

34:01.190 --> 34:03.690
There's some noise somewhere.

34:05.555 --> 34:08.446
The Prana Shakti within us

34:08.462 --> 34:13.236
comes to us through five elements.

34:13.232 --> 34:20.466
The five elements are, as you know,

34:20.491 --> 34:25.156
is, one of them is the earth,

34:25.181 --> 34:27.176
then we have got the water,

34:27.191 --> 34:30.981
then we have got the air,

34:31.000 --> 34:33.500
then we have got the light

34:33.528 --> 34:36.028
and then we have got the ether.

34:36.028 --> 34:38.528
These five elements are there.

34:38.553 --> 34:44.070
Out of these five elements our body is made.

34:44.095 --> 34:54.410
These five elements create five cocoons around
us. And that’s how we have got five auras within us.

34:54.420 --> 35:00.710
These five auras can be
detected by some machines

35:00.714 --> 35:05.430
because these machines are

35:05.430 --> 35:14.800
able to detect only the right side

35:14.800 --> 35:18.800
as they deal with matter.

35:18.810 --> 35:27.685
The whole of the matter is created by these five
energies and they have also a casual energy behind

35:27.675 --> 35:32.572
it. And these casual energies actually make that.

35:32.591 --> 35:38.986
For example: the causal
energy of earth is fragrance.

35:38.979 --> 35:44.432
From the fragrance earth is created.

35:44.439 --> 35:46.939
Now, within us all these five centres

35:46.939 --> 35:53.873
that you see

35:53.885 --> 36:01.963
these are, these five up to
here, are made of five elements.

36:01.963 --> 36:05.206
The body of those centres are made of

36:05.206 --> 36:09.378
only the body part, I am saying
– of those five elements.

36:09.364 --> 36:18.768
And the Deities residing in those centres
are also born from those five elements.

36:18.768 --> 36:22.968
Because they were born of a particular element,

36:22.981 --> 36:35.733
they concentrated more on that and maintained
the knowledge more limited to that area,

36:35.748 --> 36:38.813
which dealt with that particular element.

36:38.807 --> 36:46.841
For example, we can say the green thing is the
one that represents the water, water element.

36:46.853 --> 36:53.351
This centre in the stomach is
the water element within us.

36:53.356 --> 36:56.396
It is called as Nabhi Chakra

36:56.406 --> 36:59.986
and around it is called as the
Bhavasaghara, you can say the Void

36:59.986 --> 37:02.276
or you can say the Gap, or whatever you may say,

37:02.276 --> 37:06.576
the whole world as such, within us.

37:06.598 --> 37:15.666
So the people who were born on
this centre, around this centre,

37:15.646 --> 37:22.012
were born out of water element.

37:22.012 --> 37:28.796
In this Bhavasaghra, Bhavasaghra
means the ocean of this world

37:28.806 --> 37:36.563
were born, through this ocean of the world,
were born all the Primordial Masters

37:36.574 --> 37:38.803
one after another,

37:38.804 --> 37:43.070
we can say Abraham, Moses,

37:43.070 --> 37:49.780
we had Janaka, we had Adi Nath and Socrates

37:49.794 --> 37:52.750
and so many others like that

37:52.744 --> 37:55.244
Nanaka

37:55.244 --> 37:59.753
and also very recently we
had about hundred years back

37:59.763 --> 38:03.990
a very great saint born in India known as Sainath.

38:03.990 --> 38:08.583
They all represent the same
element, that is the water element,

38:08.598 --> 38:11.098
being responsible or being born out of that

38:11.098 --> 38:25.259
they are anxious to maintain water element as the
one which is within us for sustaining ourselves.

38:25.249 --> 38:29.969
We are sustained by water so they
help us to sustain ourselves.

38:29.958 --> 38:35.122
They are the sustainers, they tell us
how to sustain, as a human being.

38:35.119 --> 38:42.904
And all of them have tried to establish religion
within us. A religion doesn’t mean outside,

38:42.885 --> 38:49.835
but the religion as a man, means the capacity
of a man or you can say, the quality of a man.

38:49.854 --> 38:52.354
What a human being should be like,

38:52.354 --> 38:56.128
what is the way to know if
he is a human being or not

38:56.118 --> 38:59.718
which is described in the Ten Commandments.

38:59.718 --> 39:06.008
Now the way they have said it is all
misinterpreted and all wrong things have come.

39:06.027 --> 39:11.887
But one thing is definite, that they have never talked of fanaticism.

39:11.882 --> 39:14.382
They are against fanaticism.

39:14.382 --> 39:22.315
They are against alcoholism, because
alcohol spoils the water element very much.

39:22.339 --> 39:28.779
If you see the effect of alcohol on
water in the blood of human beings

39:28.789 --> 39:30.929
you will be amazed how

39:30.925 --> 39:34.315
the neutral position of hydrogen
and oxygen are over time

39:34.315 --> 39:38.395
is absolutely imbalanced by alcohol.

39:38.395 --> 39:41.094
And water cannot absorb any heat from the liver,

39:41.094 --> 39:43.594
which sorts out all your poisons.

39:43.604 --> 39:47.270
And that's how people get bad livers and bad troubles

39:47.270 --> 39:51.849
and then people would say, "What's wrong?"

39:51.849 --> 39:55.340
There is nothing wrong as such,
because even nothing wrong in that.

39:55.340 --> 40:01.079
“What’s wrong according to the theory
of wrong and right of human beings,

40:01.089 --> 40:04.309
I think nothing is wrong. You can kill
yourself. You can jump from anything.

40:04.331 --> 40:08.002
You can do whatever you like.

40:08.002 --> 40:12.032
There is nothing wrong. If you break this, if you
break that, if you break anybody, do anything,

40:12.052 --> 40:16.972
there is nothing wrong what’s wrong with it?

40:16.987 --> 40:21.299
But there is fundamentally wrong is
that you are created for a purpose.

40:21.270 --> 40:23.629
You have not created yourself.

40:23.643 --> 40:26.979
God has created you with such difficulties.

40:27.003 --> 40:31.189
He has taken you out of

40:31.182 --> 40:34.779
so many evolutionary processes
and brought you to this stage

40:34.767 --> 40:40.599
and now you have no business to
kill yourself and destroy yourself.

40:40.600 --> 40:44.209
This is wrong is that you are destroying
yourself, you are destroying your community

40:44.219 --> 40:48.469
you are destroying others or
you are destroying yourself.

40:48.479 --> 40:54.209
If you are destroying yourself also because
you are on your own, you think, "What’s wrong?"

40:54.209 --> 40:57.519
You are a part and parcel of the whole.

40:57.509 --> 41:03.289
You are a cell in the whole and
being created to know the whole

41:03.279 --> 41:06.569
and if you destroy yourself you
are destroying the whole as well.

41:06.579 --> 41:12.602
You become malignant. You become cancerous

41:12.579 --> 41:15.079
and that’s why it’s all wrong.

41:15.079 --> 41:21.388
In anyway if you destroy others or destroy
yourself you have no right to do that.

41:21.355 --> 41:24.228
God has given you freedom, no doubt.

41:24.235 --> 41:28.998
By creating ego and superego within
yourself with these activities,

41:28.998 --> 41:31.268
you become separated from the whole.

41:31.263 --> 41:34.413
And then you think you are Mr Such and Such.

41:34.413 --> 41:39.753
And then you stand and say, “I
believe in this, and I believe in...,"

41:39.769 --> 41:44.179
actually who are you? You are made by God.

41:44.189 --> 41:46.689
You are His own child.

41:46.713 --> 41:48.992
Still you are a child.

41:48.999 --> 41:53.762
It's like a baby saying, "I believe in it, I believe in it."

41:55.746 --> 41:58.110
You have not known the whole so far.

41:58.112 --> 42:01.360
How can you say that?

42:01.372 --> 42:04.870
You have to grow!

42:04.882 --> 42:08.237
And when you grow, your
freedom is complete,

42:08.239 --> 42:10.739
absolute.

42:10.739 --> 42:18.167
But the ideas about this freedom are such
that you are fighting your own innocence

42:18.177 --> 42:22.007
you are fighting your own sustenance.

42:22.017 --> 42:30.293
And this sustenance was completely supported

42:30.313 --> 42:38.603
protected by these great
incarnations of Primordial Masters.

42:38.594 --> 42:42.437
That’s why they talked against alcohol.

42:42.452 --> 42:48.072
Christ did not talk about alcohol, all
right – because He was at another point,

42:48.072 --> 42:51.792
but He did not say that you take alcohol, never.

42:51.812 --> 42:53.692
People said that He drank wine

42:53.692 --> 42:57.102
but wine means grape juice in that country,

42:57.102 --> 42:59.602
it doesn’t mean alcohol.

43:02.632 --> 43:06.042
How can Christ say, you drink wine,

43:06.056 --> 43:08.202
which is fermented,

43:08.205 --> 43:10.152
which will go against your awareness?

43:10.152 --> 43:12.385
Just think of it!

43:12.412 --> 43:15.485
It goes against your awareness, isn’t it?

43:15.482 --> 43:17.685
Your awareness is to be enlightened,

43:17.708 --> 43:20.208
He came on this earth to enlighten that awareness,

43:20.208 --> 43:25.241
do you think He will say that you get foggy with it?

43:25.218 --> 43:29.731
Does it not fog your attention and your awareness,

43:29.731 --> 43:32.231
is a fact.

43:32.231 --> 43:37.971
But He wants to do something else

43:37.961 --> 43:43.907
because He came as Divine Power itself.

43:43.988 --> 43:46.488
He was the embodiment of Pranava

43:46.488 --> 43:51.998
not Prana – all powers put together.

43:51.996 --> 43:57.488
He was the embodiment of OM itself, the Brahma.

43:57.500 --> 44:00.748
That’s why He came to prove

44:00.758 --> 44:03.220
what Krishna has said,

44:03.220 --> 44:06.460
that it cannot be killed by anyone.

44:06.473 --> 44:08.880
It cannot be blown off,

44:08.883 --> 44:12.200
it cannot be destroyed.

44:12.193 --> 44:15.453
His body was made out of that,

44:15.473 --> 44:20.953
and that’s why He could be resurrected.

44:25.303 --> 44:26.912
All these things are knowledgeable

44:26.912 --> 44:28.483
only if you are a realised soul,

44:28.483 --> 44:32.103
otherwise you cannot understand this.

44:32.103 --> 44:35.413
Because you have not yet gone into the depth

44:35.443 --> 44:37.103
of your own understanding,

44:37.123 --> 44:40.413
you are still children as I say,

44:40.403 --> 44:43.369
you have to be born again,

44:43.383 --> 44:50.799
and then you can find out for these vibrations.

44:50.782 --> 44:54.669
You have to ask just a question,

44:54.669 --> 45:03.519
“Was Christ embodied with Pranava,

45:03.508 --> 45:06.544
or the OM, or the Brahma?

45:06.539 --> 45:11.123
Or was He made of Brahma itself?”

45:11.123 --> 45:15.733
You will get the cool breeze.

45:15.733 --> 45:21.063
and that is the sign that He was.

45:21.065 --> 45:28.375
It is much deeper but the whole
knowledge exists as experience to you.

45:28.375 --> 45:33.153
The whole of it, it is an experience within us.

45:33.145 --> 45:37.005
And one has to get that experience of oneself,

45:37.030 --> 45:39.763
which is knowledge itself

45:39.780 --> 45:43.999
and then everything trickles down

45:43.995 --> 45:49.146
just like actual thing within us,
as we see white as white and red as red.

45:49.146 --> 45:55.476
Animals do not see perhaps,
but human beings do see.

45:55.496 --> 46:02.976
Thus, our awareness is enlightened.

46:02.986 --> 46:08.856
I will be talking to other Sahaja Yogis in
the Ashram about the right side later on

46:08.879 --> 46:12.916
because we have new people, and
they are to be looked after.

46:12.954 --> 46:21.250
And I think, next time when I
meet, I don’t know when, maybe...

46:21.245 --> 46:28.025
No, in the Ashram firstly. Thursday evening I think, then
I'll talk to you because Friday I've got to fly out.

46:28.017 --> 46:31.216
Thursday evening I will
be there most probably.

46:34.045 --> 46:38.855
So just now, let’s have the
experience for the new ones,

46:38.860 --> 46:44.035
and for the others also to deepen themselves.
May God bless you.

46:47.020 --> 46:50.690
All of you should put your
hands just like this, before Me,

46:50.701 --> 46:56.630
and close your eyes, just close your eyes!

46:56.630 --> 47:01.919
Put the hands like this, you
see and just close your eyes.

47:01.933 --> 47:06.310
You have to close your eyes because
the Kundalini, when She rises

47:06.273 --> 47:08.850
on the Agnya Chakra

47:08.854 --> 47:11.010
the dilatation of the pupil takes place

47:11.014 --> 47:14.717
and if your eyes are open the dilatation doesn’t take place.

47:14.670 --> 47:20.910
When people mesmerize they keep your eyes
open, because they put you on the sides.

47:20.920 --> 47:26.480
I will tell one day how they mesmerise, also.

47:29.144 --> 47:34.251
First you will feel that there is no thought
in your mind, if you watch your thoughts.

47:34.231 --> 47:41.471
Then the Kundalini rises about
Agnya, you get Thoughtless Awareness.

47:42.784 --> 47:49.621
When it pierces the fontenel bone area, I mean
when you get your baptism by your Kundalini,

47:49.620 --> 47:57.938
then you feel the kind of a cool
breeze coming towards you from me;

47:57.947 --> 48:08.017
or a kind of a radiation of cool breeze
coming. From all over you might feel it.

48:13.328 --> 48:19.389
On your hands! Through
your fingers! It works!

48:23.019 --> 48:25.529
All of you should put your
hands towards me. Please!

48:27.069 --> 48:29.569
That's important.

48:34.524 --> 48:42.210
I mean even to put your hands is hard to
request, that means how egotistical you are.

48:42.215 --> 48:48.953
You've come here for getting your Realisation
and don't even want to put your hands towards me.

48:48.974 --> 48:54.409
All such people should leave.

48:54.429 --> 48:58.634
Getting cool breeze?
Great!

48:58.634 --> 49:00.732
Close you eyes and enjoy yourself.

49:00.734 --> 49:05.522
Best is to enjoy, this is the greatest
moment you've been waiting for.

49:05.530 --> 49:10.280
Close you eyes!
Enjoy yourself!
