00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:16.000
Let me introduce to you, our mother
Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.120
Yesterday as I told you
that we are going to have a series,

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.000
one after another,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.800
and yesterday I explained to you
the introductory part of Sahaja Yoga.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:39.040
As I said, ‘Saha’ means ‘with’,
‘ja’ means ‘born’.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.880
Is born with you.
It is inborn. Is spontaneous.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.400
Is living.
Whatever is born with you is living.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.120
For, your fingers, hands,
everything is living.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:01.440
And this system is born with you.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.520
Yoga means the union with your Spirit.

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.920
Simple, it’s very simple meaning.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.120
Yoga means to join.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:17.120
To join you with your Spirit,
with the Divine.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.720
This is born with you,

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.520
this right to be one with the Divine
is born with you.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.177
Is your birthright.

00:01:29.177 --> 00:01:32.781
That is Sahaja Yoga.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:40.560
Now, to say that it is My method,
or it is today’s method,

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.880
would not be correct.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:49.920
Because this is the method
of anything that is spontaneous.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.360
Like you see a seed sprouting,

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:00.800
a flower becoming a fruit,
an egg becoming a bird,

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:07.520
or you see a caterpillar
becoming a butterfly.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.400
All this is Sahaja.
Is in-born within us.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:19.520
And this is existing within us,
of which people were aware

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.160
thousands and thousands of years back.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.600
Not only in India, you’ll be surprised.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.760
They were aware in England,

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.280
they were definitely aware in Egypt,
they were aware in Greece.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.280
Recently I went to Greece, to Athens,
and I was surprised.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.800
"Athens" word,
comes from the word Athena.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.040
Athena is their Goddess.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.520
Actually they don’t know
much about Her.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.280
But Atha in Sanskrit means primordial.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.840
She is the primordial Kundalini.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.800
Athena – is the primordial Kundalini,

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.400
the Mother
expressed as the primordial Kundalini,

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.720
or the primordial Mother.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.800
And She has in Her hand a snake,
which goes round into circles

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.240
creating chakras.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.960
It’s so clearly shown,
but they are not aware of it.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.480
And they even have
– you’ll be amazed –

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.760
the daughter of that Athena
which is placed in among all of us,

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.680
and they called this bone as sacrum,
means a sacred bone.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.920
The word sacrum has come
from Greek language –

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.400
is the sacrum, means the sacred bone,

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:41.120
that they were aware that in this bone
lies something that is very sacred.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.960
And I asked them “How did you get
this idea, was that Alexander the Great

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.480
who brought these ideas to you?”.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.320
They said “No, this is, this is
thousands of years back

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:58.400
we had a rapport with people
who were Indians, Indo-Aryan groups,

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.480
and that’s how we know about it”.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.160
Is most amazing.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.920
And so many other things I discovered
which was so surprising,

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:12.800
and so enlightening,
that these people were very much aware of it.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.920
Now, in England there is a place
called Stonehenge.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.920
I went to see that place, Stonehenge:
has tremendous vibrations.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.120
Tremendous vibrations –
the whole working of it is nothing but

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.160
the three and a half coils it is placed,
and it has come out of the Mother Earth.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.040
But people did not understand,
they started covering it up

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.000
and all they made into some
sort of a pattern.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.840
But actually the main thing
must have just come out of the Mother Earth;

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.160
and it has tremendous vibrations
and people don’t understand what it was.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.920
That means people did practice
this Kundalini business there.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.600
I went to Colombia,
I was surprised in Colombia:

00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:02.640
they told Me that the emblem
of the Navy is a… what you call that?

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.160
Condor, condor.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.720
Condor is called as a Garuda
in Indian language, I don’t know if you know.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.280
It’s a very big eagle-like thing, condor.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.960
And they said condor is the emblem;
I said: “Why condor?

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.160
I mean, what has condor to do
with the navy, I can’t understand”.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.320
So they said: “It is because
our old people tell us

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:31.360
that from India – that is Bharat –
from India a God called Vishnu

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.120
came on a condor”.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.520
Thousands of years back these people
said about Vishnu who came on a condor.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.040
I mean, I was amazed at their description
and how did they know,

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.840
I said: “How do you know?”

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.680
They said “It is said, and that’s why
we put it as condor”.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.920
We said it’s all right, we’ll have condor,
because condor is very much respected.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.880
There is no condor available there,
nobody sees them there,

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.400
nobody knows much about it,

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.600
but why they talk about condor
is because their Indians say

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.960
that Vishnu came on a condor
to their country;

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.200
now, where is Colombia, where is India.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.947
If you see the patterns
of their ornaments

00:06:11.947 --> 00:06:16.960
is absolutely what we do in India,
is to use the wire on top of the gold.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.240
I don’t know if you have seen their gold,
gold ornaments,

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.320
they had taken an exhibition round.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.560
But all of that, all Indian patterns,
they said “the Indians came down to teach us”.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.240
Oh, I don’t know how Indians
went in those days to teach them.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.080
It’s most surprising
how they had a rapport in those days.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.680
And they lost the links.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.680
Like in, say, from Iceland
I met a lady.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.440
And I just asked her, “What do you say
for sugar in your language?”.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.200
And she said that
it’s called as sharkara.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.200
Now, sharkara is the pure
Sanskrit word for sugar.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.280
Pure Sanskrit word.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.800
Now then we discovered
that the Sanskrit must have started

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.920
somewhere near Norway,
because it is said that it started

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.560
at the place where that
Rohini Nakshatra –

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.920
is one of the constellations –
is at right angle.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.400
Now that’s the place where
it is at right angle,

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.800
is Norway’s the place
where it is at right angle.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:16.000
So maybe that the pre-Latin language
got purified into Sanskrit –

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.400
there was a big rapport in this time –
and one became the Latin

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.800
and another became the Sanskrit.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.840
And there are so many common words
and common concepts

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:30.400
that it’s remarkable how we have
lost contacts and how we are separated now,

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.760
even as nations.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.720
I went to Australia and I was surprised
the language that they use

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.560
has mostly Sanskrit words.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:47.120
Like the river on which we were,
on the bank of which we were living,

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:51.520
was called as Parramatta,
means the Primordial Mother.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:55.840
I was surprised how this name was given
to that river, Parramatta.

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.000
Ask any Indian, he will know about it.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:03.600
And it’s something that we had
an all-pervading knowledge of this,

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:07.680
even in England, and must be in
America also, I should find out some places

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.000
where I’ll be able to
locate these things.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.040
Especially the old Indians
who lived in America,

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:20.400
I saw them in Chile and Argentina,
and in Colombia.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:24.560
And they knew so many Sanskrit words
in their ritualism and all that,

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:28.880
I was amazed how this Sanskrit was
with them, from where did it spread

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:33.840
and how did they have this
knowledge of Kundalini.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:40.720
But this knowledge was a secret knowledge
for many years. Thousands of years.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:43.920
There, there was a poet
called as Markandeya,

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:48.880
who lived I think they say
about ten thousand years back.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.600
He has described about the Kundalini.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.160
But he has just described
that She resides here,

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.760
and She is awakened,
and She passes those chakras and all that;

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:00.400
but not in details
and not very clearly:

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.760
in a very mystic language.

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:08.240
Now what happened in the beginning
when people started their civilization,

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:13.120
say in India,
they first were faced with the nature.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:17.040
Though in India nature is very kind,
you can live under a tree

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:25.040
or you can live under any shade
that you can get, even in a cave;

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:28.640
and you can be quite happy,
and you can eat some fruits,

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:32.880
and the climate is so good,
it’s not so cold and so hot and all that;

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.800
so one can live very happily.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.920
And they had solved their problems
like this, some people;

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:43.200
and they were living in the forest
and they started thinking about their own

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.080
existence, why are we here.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:51.120
And when they started thinking about it,
they meditated.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.760
And in meditation they discovered
lots of things.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:57.200
And the thing they discovered
that we have within ourselves

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:04.000
a residual power called as Kundalini.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.600
And this residual power is the power
which is not manifested, which is sleeping,

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:13.440
which has created the whole of
the universe that we are

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:23.760
and yet not manifested, because it has
to manifest giving you your Self-realization.

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:26.960
This is the power of desire within us,

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:32.640
the desire to become one with the Spirit.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:40.080
And that’s how they believed that there is
this power that existed in all human beings

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.320
and that it should be awakened.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.880
Today I’m trying to give you
the little history of this,

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.680
because one by one we’ll be going
to the whole thing.

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:54.240
Now there is another group of people,
who just felt that “first of all

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:58.400
we must try to master the elements”.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.920
And from these seers,
they got information

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:06.080
“to do that, you must use
the fire element,

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:08.560
worship the fire element”.

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:12.000
And they started worshipping
the fire element and started doing

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.520
the homa and havanas,
and the Vedas were written,

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:20.240
for exciting the fire element
and other elements, all the five elements.

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:25.760
So all the Vedas were written
how to master these elements

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:28.800
by pleasing the Deities that rule us.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:33.760
Even in Greece they believed
that everything has a deity,

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:39.040
like they called the Varun, we call it
as the Neptune, the one who is the Lord

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:44.640
of the sea. He is called as Poseidon,
they call it Poseidon to that special

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:48.000
Deity like that. And they believed in it
that that is so.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.280
The trouble is that that time
they did not start rationalizing

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:55.600
or sort of deducting it on this:
they believed in their seers,

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.240
and whatever their seers told them
they believed it

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:04.000
and they started working on that;
and they wanted to excite these elements.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.320
The result of that is
today’s modern science.

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:14.000
The modern science that we have got
is because we have been able to master

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.880
these five elements.

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:20.560
Now these five elements also
that we have mastered,

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:24.960
in our own freedom we might have created
lots of problems for ourselves,

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.960
for example we have created
an atom bomb.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:30.640
One can say that by mastering this,
what we have done is to create an atom bomb,

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:33.520
and a neutron bomb and this bomb
and that bomb.

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:37.440
But also for your good:
because once you have created it,

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.240
it’s sitting like a devil there.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.960
Now you are all frightened of it,
and “no more wars”.

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:47.760
Because if any more wars start,
you are all going to be finished like that.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.533
So even this devil
that you have created

00:12:50.533 --> 00:12:52.960
is frightening you from there,
and grinning at you:

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:57.120
“Alright, you have created me,
now you’d better behave yourself”.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:04.000
All such enterprises move
in one linear direction,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.920
and they recoil back.

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.320
Anything you try. Now you try
to create plastic,

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.160
now plastic is sitting on your head.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.560
You don’t know what to do
with your plastics.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.520
You do anything like that,
it comes back on you

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:18.000
and it challenges you.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.840
For example now we can say
that when we have got everything around,

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:28.400
I mean, in New York, you see,
you have got cars, you’ve got…

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.880
you can move about, you have got food,
you have got affluence,

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:33.600
as it is you are affluent people.

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:40.480
But people are running away from affluence,
they have taken to counter-cultures,

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:43.280
they’re fed up with this,
all these plastics, nylons,

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.520
finished with it, and now they are
seeking something else,

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:48.640
they are taking drugs and running away,
they don’t want to carry the junks

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:51.040
of their parents.
They’re different type of people

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:55.280
that are born. The same thing for which
they were striving so much

00:13:55.280 --> 00:14:00.640
has now bothered them so much
that they are trying to run away from it.

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:04.720
So the reaction is built in on all
these endeavours that we do

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:10.080
with the elements,
because elements cannot give you joy.

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.640
No matter can give us joy.

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:17.440
We think it can. For example if you want
to build a house, “Alright,

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.240
I must build a house, I must have mortgage,
I must have this, that”,

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.960
and you build the house.
Still you are sitting miserable

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:25.600
as if there is mourning on.
What’s the matter?

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.560
“Now I must have a car!”.
Alright, you have a car.

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.720
You have a car, you have a house
and everything,

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:33.840
and then you want to wear torn clothes.
Why?

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.480
“Because now I belong
to counter-culture”.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.360
Why did you strive so much
to have a house and a car

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.120
and all that pomp and show and style,

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:44.320
and now you are going for
a counter-culture?

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.240
Because you are not satisfied with it.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:54.960
And basically economics says this
very clearly, that one want is satiable,

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:59.680
and in general – in general –
it is not satiable.

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:02.800
The wants are not satiable in general:
you want to have one thing,

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.200
then you want to have another thing,
want to have another thing.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.440
And then you get so fed up
with these monkey tricks

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:08.640
that you want to give up.

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:11.840
You don’t want to be monkeys anymore,
had enough of it.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:16.240
Like in England when I went,
most of the people who came to Me,

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:23.280
I asked them: “What are you doing?”.
“Mother, I’m successfully unemployed”

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:27.200
There’s a big cry against unemployment,
Mrs. Thatcher is so much worried,

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:32.080
that you see people are unemployed,
but they are successfully unemployed!

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.080
They want to be unemployed!

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:36.720
That perhaps she does not know,
that they don’t want to work,

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:40.080
had enough of it, this madness,
we don’t want anything.

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:43.520
So they started running across,
finding out,

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:47.280
and the time has come now
for many seekers to be born,

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:52.080
now seekers who are beyond the seeking
of material life, they are fed up,

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.760
they want to seek something.

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:59.920
At this juncture, the market
started sending the news to people

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:03.280
that “ah, this is the place
where you can make money”.

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:07.440
So the thing got flooded,
specially your America,

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:12.560
with all the great thugs of the world
to come down here and settle down nicely

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:15.360
exploiting you. That’s what it is.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:18.400
So the history of these people
works out this way

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:26.560
that now they are here, and we do not know
what to do with ourselves and with them.

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:34.080
But one should know that the nature
has made us a human being.

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:38.080
He has created us from amoeba to this stage
for some purpose.

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:41.600
And if God has created this creation
with such care

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:44.880
and asked with some creation,
there must be some purpose.

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:50.240
He’s not going to allow His creation
to be destroyed.

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:53.120
These days in France if you find
anybody sitting on the street

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:59.120
they are discussing that there is
going to be a catastrophe; in ’82, they say.

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.760
And then if everything is going to be
destroyed, so why worry?

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:04.160
Better drink before that
as much as you can.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.800
So they’re sitting on the streets
with the bottles in their hands

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.560
till they get absolutely drunk;

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:12.320
they said “After all we are going to be
destroyed in any case, so waiting for that”.

00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:15.200
And they are just worried about that.

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:19.120
So they told Me that in New York
they are discussing only two things.

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:21.440
I said: “What, which two things
are discussing?”

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:26.240
“One is the dollar” – in American way
“dallar” you can say –

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:29.440
“and the another is the miseries
and the sufferings”.

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:35.440
I said: “Really?”. That’s the only things
are these, talking about,

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:42.480
is one is the dollar and the subsequent
suffering one has to go through.

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:51.920
It’s most surprising how we reach a point
of the proper conclusion of everything

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:55.280
but still we do not hit the right point.

00:17:55.280 --> 00:18:02.160
We reach a right conclusion,
understanding that matter is not the thing

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.480
that is going to give us joy,
we have to go beyond,

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:07.040
there’s something beyond
we have to achieve.

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:10.800
Whether you are a communist,
or whether you are a capitalist,

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:13.840
or anything, everybody knows
that this is not satisfying.

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:17.520
I’ve been to Russia Myself and the Russians
I met they said: “But there must be

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:22.160
something beyond this, isn’t it,
is not everything”.

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:25.040
Everyone of them said so,
everyone of them.

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:30.320
So, same here; and that,
when it comes to that point,

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:34.160
then only a mass evolution
has to take place.

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:38.880
And many people have to get realization,
no doubt about it.

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:43.360
So on the right hand side they tried
to discover all the elements and all that,

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:44.480
and they put that.

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:50.320
First the desire came into people
that “we should do something about it”.

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:55.120
And when they found that this one
feels little funny to work it out

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:56.960
all the time running after matter,

00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:02.160
so they took to another style of emotional,
that is devotion.

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.160
Is to surrender yourself.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:08.400
Surrender anything to anything,
like anybody comes in and says:

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:12.000
“Now this is what I am,”
alright: surrender.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.960
Surrender your brain,
surrender your understanding,

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.680
surrender your logic,
surrender your wisdom,

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:20.800
everything to that
and just you’ll be alright.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:26.240
And that’s how then we found that all
these incarnations who came on this Earth –

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:30.560
a great incarnation like Christ,
great incarnation like Mohammed,

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:35.600
great incarnation like so many other people
who came in India like Rama, Krishna,

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:39.680
and all these, they made
a nice pickle out of them.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:45.200
They started big, huge organizations,
then big huge places, and…

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:50.400
Though they were every time challenged,
like I would say that papal authority

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.600
was challenged by Martin Luther,
who was a realized soul,

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:57.680
all the people who followed Martin Luther
went into another extreme

00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:00.480
of licentiousness and permissiveness.

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:03.680
So from this end to that end,
and from that end to this end.

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:08.960
When they came on this side
they became very, very, sort of ascetic,

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:14.080
and they said “Oh, we all should become
nuns and we should lead a life

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:15.600
of absolute celibacy”.

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:18.400
I don’t know where Christ has said that,
I don’t think He could have said it

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:22.480
that you become nuns, it is nonsensical.

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:24.880
It is unnatural to be nuns and all that.

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:27.840
And I mean, they look so horrid
and so hot-tempered, I mean,

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:31.360
they have no sweetness about them I mean,
I don’t know if you have been to convents,

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:34.320
look at the children: they just shake
when they see a nun,

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:35.920
supposed to be a sister!

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:38.800
And they just shake, and they just don’t
want to look at them!

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:41.600
And these are the people in charge of God?

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:44.480
And “going to marry Christ”,
of all the things that’s the worst thing

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:47.760
that you can do, is to say
that you are going to marry Christ.

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:50.320
It’s something I don’t know from where
it came into their heads

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:54.320
that they are marrying Christ.
What right have they got to marry Christ?

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.880
How are they connected with Him;
I just don’t understand.

00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:00.160
But all sorts of nonsense,
this is the greatest nonsense

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:02.000
that they established on this Earth.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:08.800
And they started huge big nunneries
and huge big what you call these churches

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.560
and all that.

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:14.560
The worst thing they did was to
in the church to put all the dead bodies.

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:18.240
I don’t know from where did they get
this idea also, I just don’t understand.

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:21.040
In the Bible, where is it written
that you build all your churches

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:26.560
on the dead people, walk on top of them,
bring all your children to those cemeteries?

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:30.000
But all sorts of nonsense they did,
in Christianity,

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.680
worse and worst in Hinduism.

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:37.680
I need not tell you about Hindus,
the amount of nonsense they have done.

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:44.320
The person like Adi Shankaracharya
who came in the sixth century,

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:48.800
in the sixth century, he’s talked
of nothing else but what I’m telling you.

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:51.920
If you read his book – any book,
I don’t know if they are translated;

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:55.600
if they are translated –
nothing else but what I’m telling you,

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:59.040
that you have to become the Spirit;
that you have to get realization.

00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:02.560
Once you get realization you get over
all your jati.

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:05.120
Jati means your aptitudes.

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:09.920
All this caste system were based
on the aptitudes of a person,

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:14.480
not on the pre-natal system
that you are born to a Brahmin

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:17.680
you are a Brahmin;
you could be a shudra born to a Brahmin.

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:20.960
Is an aptitude, a one who is a seeker
is a Brahmin.

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:26.240
The one who wants to know about the Brahma,
wants to know about God is a Brahmin.

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:30.800
Is an aptitude. It’s really an aptitude,
because if it was not so…

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:33.760
Gita was written by Vyasa.

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:38.560
Vyasa he was a great sage
and he wrote Gita.

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:43.120
And do you know his…
I must tell you about his birth.

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:51.360
He was born to a lady,
illegitimate child,

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.520
who was just a fisherwoman.

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:56.000
And who married another man later on.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.520
This was Vyasa who wrote Gita,
and how can you say –

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:05.360
in Gita it is written, can you imagine,
that your caste, your aptitude,

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:06.960
is determined by your birth?

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:11.760
Can you believe it? The one who is
a illegitimate child, will he write like this?

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:15.440
Luckily he was illegitimate, so today
we can say that it is nonsense

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:19.760
you have put in there. And this is all
such things have been done

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:24.640
to all the scriptures. All the scriptures
they have tried to spoil,

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:27.120
for their own purpose.

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:32.800
Now, like Mohammed: Mohammed,
you can’t imagine how He lived.

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:36.960
His life was misery.
And people tortured Him,

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:39.840
these mad people there, I don’t know
why did He take His birth there.

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:42.400
It would have been better if He had
taken birth in India,

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:45.760
people would have respected Him.
He did later on.

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:50.080
But the way they tortured Him
these nomadic people,

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:53.680
they had no idea of God, nothing,
He wanted them to know about God.

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:55.920
He went there, they poisoned Him,
they tortured Him,

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:59.360
they never listened to Him.
And ultimately when He died,

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:04.960
then they said that He said
that “I’m the last Prophet”.

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:08.720
He might have said it also,
might have said, doesn’t matter;

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:13.520
but He saw the way they were behaving
and He again He incarnated.

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:15.600
He has to, any sensible man would be…

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:19.760
You see, a Mother may say
“This is the last time I’m coming to you”.

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:23.040
Last time I did say to Americans,
“This is the last time I’m coming to you”.

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:25.400
But I had to come back, what to do?

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:29.280
They had no sense at that time, I said,
“Alright, this is the last time,

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:30.720
I’m not coming to you”.

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.880
But after nine years
I just couldn’t help it, I said:

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:34.000
“Alright, I must go back”.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.640
Now you would say, “You are the other
Mother, this cannot be the same

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:38.400
She had said that She will not come back”.

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:41.840
Really, I did say. But that doesn’t mean
that I will not come back.

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:43.840
In compassion and love
I have to come back.

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:48.320
Because all My children are here, lost,
what am I to do? I have to come back.

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.720
And that’s exactly what happened
about Mohammed.

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:54.480
And now Mr. Khomeini thinks
that he is the topmost man

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:57.920
in the kingdom of God, I mean,
he’s just next to God.

00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:00.720
God knows why he doesn’t say
he’s also Bhagavan.

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:02.480
He could say that he is Bhagavan.

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:05.600
I mean, the way he is behaving
you can see now clearly

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:08.960
how fanaticism can be dangerous.

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:12.480
And this is what has happened
in the human awareness also

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:16.240
that people accepted
whatever was told to them.

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:24.560
All these great incarnations are fruits
or the flowers of the same living tree.

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:27.280
But you take out the flowers
from the tree and say

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:31.520
“This is mine, this is mine”, fight,
they become ugly and die

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:35.760
and then you say that: “Oh, this is
the religion I follow, I believe”.

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:39.520
Now, what is that “I” in you
that believes?

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:41.120
We should challenge ourselves.

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:45.280
Now, which one is this I, Mister I,
within me that believes?

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:49.360
Everybody says, even politicians,
“I believe”. Now, who is this I?

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:54.640
This I is Mister E-G-O,
is not your Spirit.

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:56.640
You are not your Spirit.

00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:05.840
When you say “I believe” it is your Spirit,
then it is an absolute, is the truth.

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:10.480
All those who are realized souls,
believe in one thing.

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:14.160
Because they become, all of them,
collectively conscious

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:16.400
and they feel one truth.

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:21.200
For example if you have ten children,
and they are realized souls,

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:23.200
you ask them to put hands
towards one person,

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:25.680
and say: “Now, where is wrong
with this person?”.

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:28.240
They will all show the same finger.

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:30.640
Same finger they will show, “It is here”.

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:35.840
Even the child, may be a six-month old,
he’ll put his finger in the mouth.

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:39.120
So Mr. Freud said this is sex,
now what to do with this half-baked fellow

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:41.360
who doesn’t know anything, this Freud?

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:47.120
Who has taken you over completely,
I don’t know how you got into his mess!

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:49.680
In all kinds of messes
you have been into,

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:52.560
and all sorts of cobwebs there have been.

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:55.760
So now the best is
first get over your ego,

00:26:55.760 --> 00:27:01.200
that’s the main part one has to play,
and you have to become your Spirit.

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:07.840
Now, to become your Spirit,
you are beautifully made.

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:12.160
There is the Kundalini, there is the Spirit
in your heart.

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:19.440
Though the seat of the Spirit is here,
but it resides in human beings in the heart.

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:24.320
Now, when the Kundalini rises,
She passes through these centers,

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:27.840
and opens the Sahasrara.

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:31.520
When this was going on,
and the other side –

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:36.000
the one where we were trying to sort of
master the elements

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.840
and on the other side we were having
these devotions and surrenderings

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:43.600
and all that – the third side,
which is very important,

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:47.040
which is the evolutionary side,
was also worked out.

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.920
The third side is the evolutionary side.

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:54.240
And the third side was working out
where people were working

00:27:54.240 --> 00:28:00.400
on this Kundalini, and were using it
for giving realization to others.

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:05.760
Now as it is you know, people are doing
Hatha yoga very much in America.

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:07.680
That’s also another jumble.

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:13.120
Because Hatha yoga was practiced
thousands of years back in India

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:17.440
by Patanjali.
Patanjali wrote about Hatha yoga.

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:23.760
When we had four type of ashramas,
or four periods of our lives,

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:28.880
in which the beginning of our lives
was a brahmacharya,

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:33.040
when you had to lead a celibate life,
live with a realized guru,

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:35.360
there was a university
which you had to join,

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:38.880
and this university was called as gotra.

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:42.240
Now for example my gotra is Shandiliya.

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:45.280
Now this was thousands of years back,
My fore-fore-fore-forefathers

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:51.280
must have studied with Shandilya Muni
and even today I am Shandiliya.

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:54.160
Now, I cannot marry anybody
in Shandiliya Gotra.

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:57.160
Even today. So can you imagine
what was the celibacy.

00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:01.600
You were not only brothers and sisters,
but the descendants of that

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:03.520
even today cannot marry.

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:06.880
This was the condition of the university,
that in a university,

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:10.880
when the boys went
after five years of age, and the girls,

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:13.680
they lived there till the age
of twenty-five years,

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:19.280
and they led a life of brothers and sisters
like a family, in complete celibacy.

00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:26.080
At that time Patanjali shastra was useful.
Are these the circumstances today?

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:35.280
It is meant for people who are not at all
exposed to sex, to begin with.

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:39.200
Secondly, it has got ashtangas,
there are eight parts.

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:41.280
Not one, eight parts.

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:44.640
Out of that is Yama Niyama,
is one of them.

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:48.480
Out of Yama, one third is the exercise,
one third.

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:51.600
So I don’t know, you calculate
how much part it is.

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:58.560
And that -enth part of this thing
has become now Hatha yoga.

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:03.680
Now you start doing that exercise
because for you Marylin Monroe is your heroine,

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:07.120
or maybe Mrs Kennedy,
I don’t know who she is,

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:10.320
some sort of a person;
so you must develop your legs like this,

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:13.920
and hands like this, and all the men
are trying to reduce their waistline

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:16.720
and doing all kinds of nonsensical things.

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:19.840
I mean, this physical body
should not be that important;

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:22.920
on the contrary one should try
to keep it clean.

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:26.560
Cleansing of the body
is much more important;

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:30.640
cleansing in the way that you don’t do
anything wrong, with your hands.

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:34.560
You mother people and here
you are trying to reduce: what’s the use?

00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:39.280
There is no hole to enter into
the God’s kingdom where you have to have

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:45.280
certain amount of these caricatures
which can pass through.

00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:53.120
What you have to have is a holy hand,
holy feet, holy eyes, holy appearances.

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:55.120
It has to be holiness.

00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:56.960
Nobody pays attention to holiness.

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:59.840
They all pay attention
to this physical appearances.

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:02.240
By this they have lost a lot.

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:06.160
And that’s how what happens
you move too much on the right hand side,

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:09.440
looking after your physical being
which is only up to this part,

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:12.880
and what you neglect is your Spirit.

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:17.680
So, all such people get heart attacks.

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:23.360
Before getting heart attacks,
they get emotionally drained out.

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:28.560
They mostly have divorces,
they see somebody, you see,

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:33.920
they are like, we can say like fireballs;
you don’t touch them.

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:38.640
Don’t go near them, even if you talk
to them they may come on you like dogs,

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:41.920
and just start howling at you,
you’ll not know how to do it,

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:46.320
they’ll bark at you, you don’t know why,
why they did it; just because they are like that.

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:49.120
They are so hot-tempered,
so ego-oriented,

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:50.720
and they think no end of themselves.

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:55.040
And such people exist here,
and so-called Hatha Yoga.

00:31:55.040 --> 00:32:00.160
There is no Yoga at all, on the contrary
you run away from your Spirit.

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:04.800
You run away from your Spirit,
only you develop your ego there.

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:08.400
Now, here as you see clearly,
there are two lines shown.

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:10.560
One is the left side, and the right side.

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:15.920
Now this left line climbs
and creates that blue thing there.

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:21.600
Now what is this left line
is the power of desire within us.

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:28.640
This power of desire manifests outside
the left sympathetic nervous system

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:32.800
on the gross, but we are showing here
the subtler side of our gross.

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:37.280
Now on the right side you have
this another power which shows yellow

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:42.240
of the bile color, is the power of action.

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:47.200
So we act by our physical being
and our mental being.

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:51.360
So is the physical and the mental,
but you see English language is little funny,

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:54.720
because when you say a mental patient,
it means that something wrong

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:56.000
on the left side.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:01.280
So what I mean is that the people
who work out with planning,

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:05.440
and with rationality, and all that,
they use this part.

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:10.000
And the people who use this part
are the people who are doing physical labor,

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.960
or physical attention, or Hatha yogi,
and all those people who have thinned down,

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:18.720
be on reduction
– all such people are on this side.

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:22.080
On the other side, on the left hand side,
is the power of desire.

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:30.000
Here the people who are emotional,
like who go on singing praises of Shri Rama

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000
and Shri Krishna on the street,
up our Oxford Street, you see,

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.920
with a thing hanging down,
and singing songs and shouting

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:44.400
and spoiling their Vishuddhi chakra
and getting cancer in the throat.

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:46.080
They are on the left hand side.

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:51.520
Or the women who are extremely romantic,
are emotional and always crying and weeping

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:56.640
and troubling others, and this type
of people are on the left hand side.

00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:00.720
Now this side, the left hand side
– this side- is the subconscious,

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:03.040
and beyond this
is the collective subconscious.

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:07.200
And this side, is the right hand side,
is our supra-conscious

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:10.320
and beyond it is collective supraconscious.

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:13.360
Now this is in Sanskrit
is called Adi Dhaiwik

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:15.440
and this is called as Adi Bhautik.

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:18.240
All these things are there
but nobody has told you.

00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:22.880
Now, when you go to these fake gurus,
what they do is to push you

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:26.080
on the left or to the right.

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:29.840
Simple thing they do is to push you
to the left or to the right.

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:32.480
They can only do that,
they cannot bring you up there,

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:35.760
because here is the super-consciousness.

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:38.320
They cannot awaken your Kundalini,
they cannot raise it,

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:41.520
so they either push you
on to the left or to the right.

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:47.840
Now beyond a certain area,
the whole of the collective subconsciousness

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:51.360
– the whole, means from the creation.

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:55.200
Now I was surprised that doctors
have found out – thank God –

00:34:55.200 --> 00:35:03.120
that the cancer is caused by some proteins,
called 58 Protein, 58 and 56 –

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:07.520
they have even photographed it –
who come into the system

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:13.280
and trigger the cancer and they come
from the area which was built within us

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:16.960
since the time of our creation,
but they don’t know what it is.

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:18.640
I mean, I have told about this ten years back&nbsp;

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:22.720
that the cancer is caused&nbsp;
by the left side movement.

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:26.640
Now if these gurus put you
onto the left hand side, what happens?

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:30.000
You get possessed by those proteins,
we call them bhoots,

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.600
are the dead spirits.

00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:35.840
You just get possessed, that’s all.
You just get possessed, you see,

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:40.560
that’s why you see if a false guru is there,
there are fifty thousand people just mad,

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:45.480
going like this, foolish, stupid people,
don’t understand anything what they are doing,

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:50.640
or what they have to achieve, if they know,
or there is nothing like finding out anything,

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:57.360
no discrimination, like silly useless
lunatics they move.

00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:59.680
And they think:
“Oh, we’ve got the knowledge”.

00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:01.200
Now, what knowledge have you got?

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:05.520
If you ask them, “What’s the knowledge?
Can you say what’s wrong with this gentleman?

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:08.560
Can you say what’s wrong with you?
You know where are you,

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:09.760
where is your Kundalini?”.

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:13.840
“Oh, we don’t believe in anything,
we just believe in our guru”.

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:17.120
Now what do you believe in guru,
he’s going to go to hell direct,

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:19.920
and you are going to follow him,
that’s what it is.

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:25.360
They are becoming mad,
absolutely mad people, recluses.

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:30.160
There is one group of people who paid
three thousand pound for flying in the air.

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:34.720
Alright? Three thousand pound,
to fly in the air, I mean,

00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:38.080
yesterday I said that put your guru
on the Leaning Tower of Pisa,

00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:42.320
it was built for that only;
and throw him down, and see if he can fly.

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:46.000
If he can fly then alright, you can pay
three thousand pounds to him.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.800
And then ultimately they end up as recluses.

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:55.920
So much so that if you show them a garlic,
a little bagged up garlic, they are frightened.

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:59.600
Can you imagine, you get frightened
of the vegetables?

00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:02.000
I mean, not even of animals
but of vegetables,

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.200
and you think you are achieving
a flying trick!

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:10.560
Such stupidity exists, that they go on
falling into it and falling into it.

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:15.600
And you are saints! You are chosen ones!

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:19.680
You are great people,
you have to achieve your Self.

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:22.320
You don’t understand,
you have no self-esteem,

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:26.960
that you give away to these horrible people
who are nothing but devils!

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:30.080
You can see it so clearly
writ large on their faces.

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:31.760
They are not going to talk against them.

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:34.000
Many people tell Me,
“Mother, why do You criticize them?”.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.960
I said: “I will hundred times
criticize them”.

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:39.440
Let them come and face Me.
None of them have put,

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:42.560
filed a suit against Me,
I’ve talked about them with names,

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:45.120
nobody has filed a suit against Me,
they dare not.

00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:47.520
Because I’ll expose them very nicely.

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:50.720
And these people have not only
ruined your Kundalini,

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:54.240
all chances of your realization,
but they have made you mad!

00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:58.480
So many people are epileptic.
So many people are going to lunatic asylum.

00:37:58.480 --> 00:37:59.440
They are getting mad.

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:05.200
And these people are supposed to be
in charge of your spiritual evolution?!

00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:09.280
One must understand that when you
become something higher,

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:12.160
you’ll have a higher level-headedness.

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:14.160
You have to be master of yourself.

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:18.160
Like if somebody starts jumping on the seat
that means he’s not in his own control,

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:21.840
I mean, somebody is making him jump.

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:27.280
You should be able to guide the whole thing,
like I would say in a car

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:32.320
we have a brake and an accelerator.
Two powers.

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:34.480
So this is the brake
and this is the accelerator,

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:37.600
you are trying to use it,
you are balancing it.

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:39.680
You are balancing it,
you are trying to learn.

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:43.200
Now you go to the left and right
and you do all kinds of mistakes, alright.

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:45.600
Then you learn it,
you become a driver.

00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:49.440
Once you become the driver,
the master who is sitting behind you,

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:53.280
gives you the seat of a master.
You become the master.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.880
And that’s what one should do,
is to become the master.

00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:00.960
But supposing you are sitting in the car
and your car takes you

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:04.080
wherever it feels like; then are you
the master of the car,

00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:08.560
or the car is master of you?

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:13.120
These people are so authoritarian,
they put authority on you,

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:16.560
they make you feel that you are nothing.

00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:20.000
Now you ask them:
“What is your authority?”.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.200
But how can you ask, because they have
taken away your authority.

00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:28.160
In Sahaja Yoga you become your authority.
You become your absolute,

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:32.720
you become your Spirit.
And then you judge others.

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:37.600
And this is what it is, that you have
to become masters yourself.

00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:41.040
I mean, these people are not equal
to the dust of your feet.

00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:44.800
This is what it is. In the eyes of God.

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:49.200
They take money from you and live on that
– parasites, of the worst type,

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:55.760
are these Lamas! They were parasites
of these Tibetan people, poor people;

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:59.280
they used to get money from them
and live in Lhasa very nicely.

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:03.600
Very “great” people, and having now
in what, Gobi desert that Skambhala

00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:08.560
or Shambhala nonsense of that;
let them all go to Gobi!

00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:12.720
Let them live there, that is the place
meant for such people.

00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:18.400
They have taken money from the poor people,
exploited them, and here like parasites

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:21.200
living on them. What work are they doing?

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:27.600
They are doing no work, and they are
the people who can show you how parasites are.

00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:33.360
Now supposing if I tell you that you come
and live with Me free of cost: will you accept?

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:35.840
Anyone of you?

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:39.760
They take money from you – there’s another
fellow who has got fifty-eight Rolls Royces,

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:45.280
one who has fifty-nine Rolls Royces.
And you don’t understand!

00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:48.960
That you cannot give metal
and get the Spirit.

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:52.640
You have to achieve your own Spirit.
It has to happen to you.

00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:53.920
You have to become the Spirit.

00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:56.880
And the third force is your
evolutionary force.

00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:01.200
Is the evolutionary force within us
which is the sustaining force,

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:03.120
by which we are sustained.

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:05.600
Like carbon has four valences.

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:07.280
Carbon is here.

00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:12.080
At this time the carbon was created
with four valences, you see here.

00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:15.280
It’s a tetravalent.
But in the gross it is carbon,

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:18.720
but in the subtle it is innocence.

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:21.920
In the subtle it is the innocence.
Matter is innocent;

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:25.760
if you hit it, it will hit you back.
If you don’t hit it, it will not hit you.

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:28.960
So the innocence, the embodiment
of innocence, is here.

00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:32.240
And this chakra is the embodiment
of innocence,

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:37.200
and the Deity of that is called as
Shri Ganesh, who incarnated later on

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:41.120
as the Embodiment of innocence,
was Christ our Lord,

00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:44.880
at that center where is the Agnya chakra.

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:51.040
Now imagine, the One who is the embodiment
of innocence,

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:54.080
these horrible nuns
are trying to marry Him!

00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:57.600
Will an innocent man marry?
He doesn’t know marriage,

00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:01.840
He doesn’t know sex,
He’s beyond these things!

00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:08.400
He’s not a human being, He is Omkara!
He’s Pranava!

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:12.000
He is the Divine power.
How can He marry these women?

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.160
These women, with their baser things,
they want to sublimate it and say that

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:17.120
“We want to marry Him”.

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:22.320
If they want to marry they should marry
human beings, they cannot marry God!

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:24.800
And that is what He is, Christ.

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:32.640
And the Christ’s Advent is very important
in the history of our evolution.

00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:36.560
If I talk about Christ to Indians they say
“You are trying to make us Christians”.

00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:40.480
If I talk to you about Shri Krishna
you will say I am trying to make you Hindus.

00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:43.840
It’s a very funny world, I must say.

00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:47.120
Christ has said: “Those who are not
against Me, are with Me”.

00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:51.520
Who are those?
You didn’t allow Him to speak!

00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:55.680
Hardly you allowed Him to live for three
years and you crucified Him!

00:42:55.680 --> 00:43:00.000
He rode the donkeys and I think all these
donkeys have become now Christians.

00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:03.520
That was the symbol –
that they crucified Him;

00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:06.880
and today again they are crucifying Him
by not accepting

00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:11.200
that they must have their Spirit.
They are to be born again.

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:15.040
Now, they are to be born again means what?
You certify “I am born again”?

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:20.000
I mean, how can you certify yourself
“I’m born again”? Is artificial!

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:24.240
Like this, we have made a mess
of all of these great Incarnations.

00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:27.120
Still Christ has said:
“Everything can be forgiven”.

00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:30.560
And it’s true.
Everything can be forgiven,

00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:33.920
all your sins can be forgiven,
everything can be forgiven,

00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:36.240
but become the Spirit.

00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:40.480
If you don’t become the Spirit,
then the dead will go to dead.

00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:44.160
Spirit is the only living thing,
and Spirit is the only thing

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:48.720
you should achieve, and that you
should become, the rest of it is all mithya,

00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:51.520
is all falsehood, is all fake.

00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:57.520
Spirit emits the Brahma, the power,
the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost

00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:00.960
as they call it. That is the Spirit
within you that emits,

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:06.560
and that’s what you should achieve –
which organizes, which thinks,

00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:15.360
which acts, which works out everything
that has to be done, and also with love.

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:18.720
The whole thing put together
is nothing but love.

00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:24.160
But love that only emits,
which doesn’t receive anything.

00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:27.280
It doesn’t receive anything, I mean,
if you want to hit Me also

00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:32.160
I’ll not receive it. I will not receive
anything whatsoever you want to do to Me,

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:33.040
that’s what it is.

00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:37.200
And that should happen to all of you,
that you should not become anymore

00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:43.120
recipient of all these nonsensical things,
but just manifesting your love to others.

00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:46.160
That should happen to every seeker.

00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:49.920
And once that happens, you reach that state
which I described yesterday

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:54.640
as Nirvikalpa Samadhi. That Samadhi
must come, that awareness,

00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:58.560
enlightened awareness you must have,
you must achieve that.

00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:03.280
In Sahaja Yoga one has to understand
that it is your own progress

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:06.800
which is important, and the progress
of the whole that is important.

00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:10.080
It’s not only your own progress,
but the whole, the collectivity –

00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:13.520
specially, as he has said,
that at Vishuddhi chakra,

00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:16.560
here is the point of our evolution
where we raised our head.

00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:20.400
Yesterday I told you that when we
raised our head from animal kingdom

00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:22.800
we took up the responsibility
upon ourselves,

00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:27.760
and that chakra is nothing else
but your great country, America.

00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:32.240
You have been talking big, no doubt,
you think you are going to solve

00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:35.200
the problem of the whole world,
everywhere you go and meddle with.

00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:37.680
Like Vietnam, here, there, and that.

00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:40.320
And then you receive the bad things,
you’ve done a mistake.

00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:43.680
If you had achieved your Spirit,
then you don’t have to go anywhere,

00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:46.320
sitting here you can solve the problems.

00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:49.240
The All-pervading power
with which you are connected

00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:54.320
– you’ll be amazed –
works out instantaneously.

00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:56.720
Sitting down here you can work it out.

00:45:56.720 --> 00:46:00.560
Only one thing it cannot do:
there it is helpless.

00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:04.960
And that’s a point I come before you
with a folded hands.

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:09.440
That is you have got your freedom
to choose.

00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:13.840
If you are egoistical, if you are
superego means you are possessed,

00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:15.440
you will not choose it.

00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:20.880
So with your own freedom,
with your free will, you have to choose it.

00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:25.120
And if you have chosen it
with your free will, it can happen to you,

00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:29.280
otherwise it will not.
Because your freedom has to be respected,

00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:32.400
you have to enter into
the kingdom of God,

00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:38.560
you have to become absolutely free
citizens of that great freedom.

00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:43.840
And if your freedom is not respected
you cannot enter in.

00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:47.040
So first thing your freedom
has to be respected,

00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:49.840
if you don’t want it you cannot get it.

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:52.720
I cannot force on you,
nobody can force it on you,

00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:56.640
nobody would like to do it.
It is you you have to ask for it.

00:46:56.640 --> 00:47:01.680
That’s why He said: “Seek”.
Christ has said: “You have to seek”.

00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:06.400
If you seek, if you ask for it,
you’ll get it. You have to knock.

00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:08.880
If you do not knock,
the door won’t open.

00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:11.600
Door should open for us,
everybody thinks “While sitting down here

00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:14.880
we should get it” – no.
You have to ask for it.

00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:17.680
Then only you can enter
into the kingdom of God.

00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:23.440
Imagine a person who is a slave:
will you make him the king?

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:26.800
We have to free from our ego
and from our superego,

00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:29.520
that’s why Christ is sitting down there
at that point,

00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:35.040
where you enter into the kingdom of God
which is the limbic area, on top there.

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:38.960
When you awaken Christ,
He sucks your ego and superego,

00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:44.160
all your karmas and your ego,
all your conditionings and all your ambitions.

00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:48.960
Everything sucked in – by sucking that
only you get this portion opened out

00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:52.720
which is called as the fontanel bone area
and you get the cool breeze coming out,

00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:56.320
and many people have felt it yesterday.

00:47:56.320 --> 00:48:00.160
This is what it was said,
that Christ should be awakened within us,

00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:03.040
He should be born within us,
by which He sucks in.

00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:07.120
I wish Christians had carried
this message properly to Indians.

00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:08.800
They did not.

00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:13.520
They gave such a funny idea about Christ
that they put a loaf, imagine,

00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:19.600
loaf in the well and said,
“This is the meat of a cow”.

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:23.040
And they can’t eat the cow’s meat,
so you all have become Christians.

00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:25.520
Like that villages after villages
became Christians,

00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:30.080
imagine what a message of Christ
they gave to people.

00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:32.720
If they had told about this,
then people would have known

00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:36.320
that the One who is promised as Mahavishnu,
who is going to come on this earth

00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:40.400
to take away all our karmas and all that,
people would have taken to another course.

00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:44.240
But it never came. So still they are,
poor things, are plodding with their karmas,

00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:48.720
and here the gurus are coming and telling
you that you have to get over your karmas.

00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:49.280
Imagine.

00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:53.360
Now what are these gurus paid for, then?

00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:57.040
If you have to do… Anything happens,
they say: “It is your karmas!”.

00:48:57.040 --> 00:49:01.200
Then why are you paid for?
You are taking all our money,

00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:05.280
everything from here, and having big huge
places for yourself,

00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:08.800
and where we are suffering here
under pressures and all kinds of things.

00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:11.840
And you are telling us that this is because
of “your karmas”.

00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:14.960
If it is so, what is the need
you to be there?

00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:18.880
So this is what one has to understand,
the general history of these three things

00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:24.000
I told you: one is the power of desire,
we call it as the Mahakali power.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.920
Maha-Kali power.

00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:29.960
This is the another power,
is the power of action which is Kriya shakti

00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:32.800
– actually this is called as Iccha Shakti
and Kriya Shakti –

00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:36.080
but in our language,
in Sahaja Yoga language,

00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:39.200
called as Mahakali –
this is called as Mahasaraswati.

00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:41.440
And this as Mahalakshmi.

00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:43.680
Mahalakshmi is the power of evolution.

00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:47.600
And Christ’s Mother was the Incarnation
of Mahalakshmi power.

00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:50.400
And how, and why,
that I will tell you later on,

00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:53.120
when I’ll come to this by chakras
and chakras.

00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:58.880
I hope they have been able to follow
My lecture and I’ve been able to explain,

00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:03.600
but if there is no explanation,
and if you want to know about something,

00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:11.746
you can ask Me.

00:50:11.746 --> 00:50:13.600
May God bless you.

00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:22.400
I know. Where’s this Freud, you see,
your great Mr. Freud.

00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:25.200
Must be another devil, I must say,
to put this idea.

00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:27.600
He didn’t know anything, he had no business
to talk about it,

00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:33.920
he was most unauthorized person.
What did he know?

00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:38.240
He didn’t know anything, you read his book
and… Find Jung thousand time better.

00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:41.840
Jung something knew about it, you see,
he got his realization also.

00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:44.720
This fellow, Freud,
he died of cancer.

00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:48.640
When you see his dying of cancer
at least don’t follow him.

00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:55.040
But you all have become Freudians.
In London there are only 12 Jungians.

00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:58.000
You see? And all of them are Jews,
so they don’t believe in Christ.

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:05.040
So how can you talk to them?
Jews don’t believe in Christ. Why?

00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:08.480
And that’s why they wanted to suffer.
Alright, so you had suffering, had it.

00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:14.240
Now will you believe in Christ or not?
They want to suffer, alright, have it.

00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:19.280
They asked for it. For eleven years
this thing was growing up,

00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:24.720
this racialism in Germany, if you read
the history of Germany, it’s most surprising.

00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:30.240
And these Germans used to kill the Jews,
do this – “Oh, we have to suffer”,

00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:33.360
among themselves they used to say.
If somebody’s killed they would never protest,

00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:38.560
for eleven years. Then, then Hitler
came into power, afterwards.

00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:42.240
And then he started doing all these things,
for eleven years they were trying to suffer.

00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:46.560
Now they had a real, right,
“royal” suffering.

00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:52.320
That’s what they had. Still if you meet
a Jew he’ll still say “I don’t believe in Christ”.

00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:54.000
Who are you not to believe in him?

00:51:57.840 --> 00:51:59.760
Many children suck their thumbs now…

00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:03.840
Ah, that, this thumb they suck
because you are catching on the left Swadishthana.

00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:06.400
If you go to some horrible guru,
they will start – poor things –

00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:06.960
sucking this thumb.

00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:10.000
Means left Swadishthana.
You are going to some unauthorized person,

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:16.160
the child may be a realized soul,
and he’ll start sucking his thumb.

00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:18.800
We give so much trouble to our children,
we have no idea.

00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:22.720
And now so many realized souls
are going to be born.

00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:27.280
There are, so many, and to our sahaja
yogis… now Gavin has a daughter,

00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:32.720
her name is… Olympia,
because I went to Olympics before that, you see.

00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:35.760
And so when I came back
I gave her the name Olympia.

00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:40.640
And if you see her,
she’s a tremendous child. Tremendous child.

00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:43.840
If she was here, she would not allow Me
to speak, I have to take her in My lap

00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:48.320
and speak to you. Have you got
a photograph? The green?

00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:56.560
Eh? Alright. My purse is not there…

00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:58.800
So many children are born.
There’s another one –

00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:02.640
when I went to Greece
there was another child was born, Athena.

00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:06.160
And so many; there’s another one
who is called as Dattatreya.

00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:09.760
We have so many now in England,
born realized. And they know.

00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:11.680
They get after people, you see, they work.

00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:16.240
We have lots of people, about ten or twelve
children sitting down and lots of people,

00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:19.200
and they help Me, they are around Me
and they tell Me: “Here it is”.

00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:24.560
They go on hitting, and they start
improving the chakras and giving bandhans,

00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:27.120
and all that, and they work it out
so well, they know so much.

00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:31.760
My own grandchildren, four of them,
are first class realized souls.

00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:37.520
First class. Absolutely top class people.
Some very great souls.

00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:41.200
Very great souls, and they are so simple,
and they understand things so well.

00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:46.160
Like the younger one, she’s the youngest
was about three years of age,

00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:49.320
and she was going to some nursery school,
and she brought a paper –

00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:53.520
imagine, in a little children’s school,
they sent a paper –

00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:59.200
saying that there’s a course on for youth,
for your transformation.

00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:02.320
So she brought the thing and she said:
“What is written in this thing?”.

00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:05.520
I said: “You can change if you join this
course for hundred rupees,

00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:09.280
you have to go to a hotel”.
So this little one says:

00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:11.600
“How can that be possible?
By paying hundred rupees

00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:16.080
you cannot just do it! The Kundalini
must be awakened, otherwise how can you?

00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:18.400
Kundalini doesn’t understand money!”.

00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:22.240
The little one says, three-year-old.
The elder one says:

00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:26.240
“But by doing a course, if you can do it,
my father has done fourteen courses,

00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:30.320
his Kundalini’s not yet risen”.

00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:35.333
Just see, how simple it is for them
to see. But you cannot see.

00:54:35.333 --> 00:54:39.360
Is your ego, you have over-developed ego,
you think you can study.

00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:44.587
You mean to say people who are not educated
are not going to get realization?

00:54:44.587 --> 00:54:48.960
Is a living, living thing.
Do we study for our breathing?

00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:51.600
Imagine we have to go to library
to understand how to breathe:

00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:53.920
what will happen to all of us?

00:54:53.920 --> 00:55:02.160
We’ll never reach the library!
Yes?

00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:06.960
Mother, I think, you know, yesterday
something very – I can’t understand,

00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:12.560
but was very nice, very good happened,
and I would like to do it – what to do?

00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:19.760
I didn’t come today to the workshop,
but how can I find out?

00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:25.760
I mean, if you don’t come to the workshop,
what should I do?

00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:30.382
Can I try again? I’m coming here…

00:55:30.382 --> 00:55:33.040
Now, I would say. Put your willpower.
What I’m saying, put your willpower.

00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:37.200
I’m here only for five days,
not more than that; now only four days.

00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:42.160
Now, make best use of Me,
what else can I say? Alright?

00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:46.800
I am staying in that hotel because of you,
alright, that you could come

00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:48.320
and see Me in the morning time.

00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:52.080
Those who came, ask Herman:
how much he was helped, how much he learnt.

00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:56.160
How will you learn unless and until
you come to Me? Alright?

00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:58.240
You must come; put little willpower.

00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:01.120
You see, supposing I had taken
hundred dollars from you:

00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:04.720
you would have come.
Definitely, I know American temperament.

00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:08.160
You see, I asked them why they do it.
You see they said it’s like this:

00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:12.880
you buy a ticket for a picture,
or say for a play, alright?

00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:17.520
And the play is horrible,
but you say ‘we paid, so let us sit down’.

00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:21.760
You paid for it, you see,
everything is paid for, is paid for:

00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:25.760
that’s why. But you cannot pay Me
and you cannot buy Me.

00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:30.320
But you must tell yourself,
that “If I am a realized soul,

00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:36.000
I should know all about it”. Alright?
Put in your willpower. Put in your willpower.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:39.200
Because I cannot mesmerize you
and I cannot force you.

00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:43.440
Here all those who came to Me this morning
were very much helped,

00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:46.640
and you are much better now.
Ask anyone of them,

00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:48.240
how much happier they are.

00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:53.120
Some people who had a very bad back
and all that, I cured them,

00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:58.720
and somebody had a pain here, I cured him;
everybody was helped, no doubt.

00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:01.200
Everybody was helped very much.

00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:04.720
Those who didn’t come would be
lagging in their progress,

00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:10.960
definitely, no doubt about it.

00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:16.480
Yes. We’ll make an announcement at the end
of the program precisely where you should come.

00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:21.040
Yes, yes of course.
I’m sticking onto that place.

00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:26.400
I’m not getting out at all.
Actually they lock Me in.

00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:31.120
And they keep somebody to watch Me,
I may disappear you see, in the thin air,

00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:33.360
so I’m just there for you,
waiting for you.

00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:38.240
I’ve come all the way for you only,
isn’t it. What have I got to do in this

00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:42.400
New York the great? Yes?

00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:55.360
He’s saying that “I said I had
problems with my chakras,

00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:57.440
other people who have trouble with
can you help them?”

00:57:57.440 --> 00:58:01.200
Of course; you can also help yourself,
and I can help you also,

00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:05.440
and you will know everything about it;
everything you will know.

00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:09.040
You see, if I know what’s there?
If I have all the powers what’s there?

00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:15.840
Why should you believe in Me?
You should have your own powers.

00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:25.360
This is simple. Alright?
Any other questions?

00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:32.240
They are very positive people, I must say.

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.160
You cannot do it by effort.

00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:41.520
It’s not, is not correct.
On the contrary pranayama

00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:43.120
gives you sinus problems.

00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:48.640
And so many other problems. Then this
Hamsa Chakra gets caught with the pranayama.

00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:54.240
This is a very bad chakra which once caught
it’s very difficult to correct.

00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:57.840
How about meditation?
Do you feel it’s good to meditate?

00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:01.360
You cannot “do” meditation,
you have to be in meditation.

00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:04.160
Once it happens, you are there,
you are in thoughtless awareness,

00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:07.600
you are watching everything like a witness.
The whole thing looks like a drama.

00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:11.200
It seems to come and go,
sometimes meditation comes and then

00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:13.520
it’s not there, and it varies…

00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:17.920
It cannot be; if you know everything
about Kundalini and if your Kundalini

00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:22.160
is really done, then it does its workout
– in the beginning you have to be

00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:23.600
carefully for a month only.

00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:27.280
For a month you have to give
little intensive care; and then it’s all right.

00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:30.720
It’s like a patient coming out
of intensive care.

00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:35.920
But you have to treat yourself first of all
like a patient. Look after yourself,

00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:44.000
put full effort to understand everything,
cure yourself, and you are all right.

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:48.320
But put some willpower, you see.

00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:52.640
You should have come. I asked them,
what about the boy who wanted to get married?

00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:55.680
I could have got you a bride today.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:06.320
Alright, but now you might miss the point!

01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:06.960
Yes My child?

01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:14.000
About whom?

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.200
About the Jews.

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:19.120
You should not be angry with Me.

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:22.872
No, I want to tell you what happened.
I am not angry with You…

01:00:22.872 --> 01:00:41.080
Alright.
I know, I know.

01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:45.680
How can you treat that?
Alright we’ll see, alright we’ll see.

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:06.320
No, not, it’s not… it’s true,
I was also a Jew once upon a time,

01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:07.840
for your information.

01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:08.320
what?

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:11.280
I was also a Jew in one of My lives.
Alright?

01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:14.480
And I was sympathies with them,
but they are foolish to say

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:16.800
that they should suffer:
why should they suffer?

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:18.640
Suffering is ridiculous.

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:22.160
Alright, alright. Then they say
that “We don’t believe in Christ”:

01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:24.960
what right have they got to say so?
They have to believe,

01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:31.120
because Christ was a Jew Himself.
You know, I was born in an Indian

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:34.640
Christian family in India.
No Indian Christian believes in Me.

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:37.760
You’ll be surprised,
not a single Indian Christian.

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:41.680
All are Muslims, Hindus,
Jains, Parsis, everybody.

01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:45.200
You will believe Me or Americans,
but Indian Christians don’t believe in Me.

01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:50.240
That’s what.

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:50.668
Indian Christians don’t believe in You.

01:01:50.668 --> 01:01:50.707
No.
That’s what She’s talking about.

01:01:50.707 --> 01:02:03.111
I couldn’t believe it! They are the only
people who don’t believe in Me.

01:02:03.111 --> 01:02:05.760
They are too close. Too close.

01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:06.320
Eh?

01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:07.760
Too close.

01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:14.480
It’s jealousy, I think.
I don’t know what it is. It’s funny.

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:18.720
But if I was, say,
if I was the President of India,

01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:22.960
they would have been all very close to Me.
My nearest relations would have been there.

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:26.720
You see, because then they think
materially they can have advantage.

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:30.880
But believing in Me for them
is very difficult.

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:35.920
Except for My own brothers and sisters,
because they know Me from My childhood.

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:39.040
And My father himself and My mother.

01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:42.480
I don’t think any Indian Christian
really believes in Me.

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:46.880
There are people who have cast
My horoscope and he said:

01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:49.280
“You are tremendous I mean,
just can’t believe it

01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:54.000
that this is Your horoscope”
and all that, but he cannot believe in Me.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:57.520
See, there’s still a barrier,
because he’s an Indian Christian.

01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:59.600
Perhaps they think to be Indian Christian
is very low,

01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:01.360
and how can I be something so great?

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:06.720
Maybe that, or they don’t believe
in themselves, I don’t know what it is.

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:11.720
But it’s a fact. And that’s why Jews
did not believe in Christ.

01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:21.280
And even today they are trying
very funny things,

01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:26.800
like there was a questionnaire,
I will tell you, in London;

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:29.280
the Jews are trying you see
– they have money –

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:34.000
so they told the Times people
to put some sort of an article against Christ.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:41.360
And what they said was that in the Bible
it was said that a girl is going to give

01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:46.960
birth to Christ according to the
Hebrew language, but not a Virgin.

01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:52.080
Now, in those days, girl meant a virgin;
even today in India “kanya” means a virgin

01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:53.520
and also means a girl.

01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:58.640
Means they didn’t have eighty-year-old
girls as we have in America in those days,

01:03:58.640 --> 01:03:59.680
you see.

01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:04.640
And it means that. And now another logical
thing one can see that if the girl

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:08.160
was not going to give birth,
then is a man going to give birth?

01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:12.880
Why did they say “girl”,
if it was just a woman,

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:15.600
why did they say particularly girl?

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:19.840
Such absurd things about this shroud
of Christ also, they created another

01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:23.680
controversy for nothing at all,
that the shroud of Christ.

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:28.480
It is His shroud, no doubt,
but when He died, He was tied with it,

01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:31.760
means from both the sides
it was pulled out, so very longish face

01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:35.040
and all that, He was not that longish
type of a person.

01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:39.200
And because you see after all
the color is smearing, is part of the body,

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:43.200
it cannot be three-dimensional,
so it looks very thin and sickly

01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:45.200
and pulled out stuff.

01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:48.400
It is His shroud, no doubt,
but this was the shroud that was,

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:55.600
that covered Him when He was just taken out
and was covered and put in the grave.

01:04:55.600 --> 01:05:00.160
Now they are saying this was the shroud
they used – is a proof that He was taken

01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:03.760
and smuggled into another country
and He never resurrected.

01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:09.600
This is the speciality of these Jews
they are establishing now.

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:14.960
I said, “Now, anybody who has common sense
if they have to smuggle a body

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:18.000
from one country to another,
will they cover it with a shroud

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:26.560
which has got all the bloodstains on it?”.
Think of these people how they are after Christ.

01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:30.560
They talk of Yehowa, who is an
abstract God, and they are the grossest people,

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:36.080
I can tell you, they think of money,
money, money, money, five times.

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:39.920
They talk of the abstract –
now we have many, many sahaja yogis

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:42.720
who are Jews.

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:46.960
Sahaja yogis who are Jews.
And they feel it.

01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:50.640
And they feel so worried, so worried –
two of them had come here,

01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:53.040
now they have gone away –
about their parents,

01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:58.320
and about other people,
what’s going to happen to these people.

01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:03.280
They see, because Christ exists there,
I can prove it to you on Kundalini.

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:06.880
I’ll prove it to you on Kundalini –
Kundalini won’t rise unless and until

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:13.920
you accept Jesus Christ Himself –
nobody else but Jesus Christ –

01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:16.240
I’ll prove it to you.

01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:22.880
No, no, this you are accepting
at this level. Is not the point.

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:27.200
At that level you’ll accept. At that level
when you’ll become the Spirit.

01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:29.680
At this level, whatever you are accepting
is your own concept,

01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:31.040
because you are born as a Jew.

01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:34.320
If you were born as a Christian,
you would have been: “I’m Jesus Christ”.

01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:36.720
There are many like that,
who are saying like that.

01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:39.040
There’s one gentleman who is saying
“I’m Jesus Christ” now.

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:42.240
I said, “Put him on the water”.
Can he walk?

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:48.720
Just let him walk, one foot up
and one foot down!

01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:51.240
It’s very simple, you know,
to believe into anything.

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:53.280
Khomeini believes he is God himself.

01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:58.000
I mean, how can you say that?
There is nothing absolute about it,

01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.840
you have to find the absolute.

01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:03.680
Alright? When you find your absolute,
then you should say: “This is the truth”,

01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:10.240
not believe. Alright? Many Jews now
have become sahaja yogis,

01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:12.148
they have become the Spirit.

01:07:12.148 --> 01:07:12.392
I haven’t yet?

01:07:12.392 --> 01:07:14.560
No, no, I’m just telling you
that many Jews have become,

01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:17.280
and they are following it up
and understanding.

01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:20.960
You are nothing, you are the Spirit,
I know that, I see you are the Spirit,

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:22.560
but you have to become that.

01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:27.920
Spirit has to come in your awareness,
it has to come in your central nervous system,

01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:57.760
it exists, I see that, clearly.

01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:11.840
She is asking for You to comment
on child abuse, and all the dreadful things

01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:16.560
that happen and she is wondering why,
if there are so many of these young children

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:20.800
who are realized souls,
why do they suffer so much.

01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:26.640
You see, in these countries,
only the extremely highly developed people

01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:31.440
will be born, or the absolutely
the most negative, the anti-Christ will be born.

01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:34.080
The mediocres are not going to take birth
in this country,

01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:37.360
where the children are treated like this.
They’ll be born in India.

01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:39.440
That’s why we are having
population problem!

01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:47.600
That’s why you see why we have
a population problem in India:

01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:54.240
because you ill-treat your children!
And the children don’t want to be born here.

01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:58.720
In England a radio fellow came
and asked Me – as usual sinister, as usual –

01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:02.640
he asked me that:
“What about your population problem?”.

01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:05.360
I said, “You are responsible,
I’m sorry for that”.

01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:09.760
He said, “How are we responsible?”.
I said: “In England two children are killed

01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:14.880
every week, statistically;
which sane child would be born

01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:17.600
in that horrible country,
except for somebody who is of a very

01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:20.880
dynamic temperament, who’ll come
and put them right?”.

01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:27.360
And these children are born to take over,
let them grow.

01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:30.080
They’ll teach them all of them a lesson.

01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:36.240
Don’t you worry. You’ll pass through
all that. You’ll overcome that.

01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:43.680
I know they are satanic.
I know they are satanic.

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:49.840
They are satanic people.
But they’ll be put right. Don’t you worry.

01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:54.320
These children will surpass them.
They are great. They are dynamic.

01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:57.040
They are special people.
Don’t you worry about them.

01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:03.360
They’ll be all looked after.
They’ll get over it.

01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:18.080
Any other questions or shall we have it now?
The thing is to get it.

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:24.240
And then the questions get answered.

01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:32.720
Now what about your “bhagavan”?
Better take out from your dresses.

01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:34.400
Better take it out. This is no, no…

01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:40.960
Take it off. It’s going to absorb vibrations
and stop your Kundalini from rising.

01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:43.760
Absolutely you’ll feel so hot
in the beginning only.

01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:45.600
You’ll feel terribly hot.

01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:51.840
Bhagavan once was my guru,
but then I left.

01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:52.880
But you better leave him!

01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:54.400
… wear the beads, what about it?

01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:58.320
Why? No, no no! Beads also, no no,
nothing, nothing, anything

01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:00.720
that you might from him,
throw it away in the sea!

01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:03.920
Horrible fellow he’s already finished.

01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:14.800
Yes? Tell me something about Bhagavan,
who is he?

01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:21.920
Tomorrow I’ll tell him who he is.

01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:34.480
You Americans are very, very liberal people,
you have asked all the anti-Christ

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:36.800
to come and settle down here.

01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:42.080
And their vibrations are going to explode,
and all earthquakes are going to come

01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:45.520
in this country if you don’t throw them away.

01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:49.440
Your media is not going to listen to Me,
they don’t want to come to Me,

01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:53.520
and listen to this.
This country will be destroyed,

01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:58.880
you take it from Me. You give them
ranches and all that.

01:11:58.880 --> 01:11:59.760
He bought it?

01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:04.960
Nothing, nothing, you give up
this dirty cloth!

01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:08.000
Horrible, everything is horrible,
very bad vibrations.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:13.680
I’ll tell you tomorrow who he is. Alright?
All of them were devils,

01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:16.480
very well known to Me, long time back.

01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:23.657
About fourteen thousand years back I knew them.
One better than the other.

01:12:23.657 --> 01:12:23.672
He’s a devil?

01:12:23.672 --> 01:12:32.560
He is a devil. Can’t you see?
What is holiness in him?

01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:35.040
His whole ashram is gutted
and all that, finished.

01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:40.640
Indians never liked him.

01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:57.600
You can see the pulsation of the Kundalini,
you can see the rising of the Kundalini,

01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:03.120
you can feel the pulsation
on your fontanel bone here.

01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:07.520
Then when the pulsation stops,
then you see the cool breeze coming out,

01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:12.960
you can feel it.
You see, you should feel.

01:13:17.088 --> 01:13:22.240
Yes, you can also feel it.
Everyone will feel it.

01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:27.600
There is no devil in you, none of you:
you are all saints.

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:32.880
But the trouble is these devils have put
some spirits in you, you are possessed.

01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:35.120
Which you have to cleanse.

01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:38.480
That you will yourself feel.

01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:42.880
My whole body here I felt very hot,
my whole body was very hot.

01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:43.360
I know.

01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:44.240
And it was cool out.

01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:48.880
That’s it, that’s it.
Coming to Me you’ll feel hot even,

01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:53.107
I told you, that you better change
this dress of yours next time.

01:13:53.107 --> 01:13:53.120
This color…

01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:56.160
Horrible color this one is,
why to announce it?

01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:57.040
What?

01:13:57.040 --> 01:14:03.760
Why to announce that you are a sannyasi?
If you are you are, you don’t announce it, do you?

01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:08.320
You don’t need to wear this colour?
You should not wear this color…

01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:11.360
Throw it away! Throw away all his books,
throw away his photographs,

01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:12.880
throw away everything!

01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:16.560
But the color is not Bhagavan,
the color is God. Isn’t it?

01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:24.320
No, no. This color symbolizes something,
na? It symbolizes someone. It’s a symbol.

01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:28.880
And that gives you,
gives you bad vibrations. It does, it does.

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:32.320
Moreover, I am deadly against this color
from the very beginning,

01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:35.675
which I’ll tell you tomorrow.
Red is first class.

01:14:35.675 --> 01:14:38.160
Red, not orange?

01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:40.080
Red one, not orange.

01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:40.640
I see.

01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:41.040
Alright?

01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:44.960
You’ll know that the orange people,
all over the world, buy that dress.

01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:48.720
You don’t know. The other day somebody
came to Me, he said: “Mother,

01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:50.360
I have to make one prayer to You”:
I said, What?

01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:55.200
He said: “Please save all the orange people”
I said: “Who are these orange ones?”.

01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:57.360
Then he said: “These Bhagavans”.

01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:08.720
Bhagavan! Bhagavan can’t even
smell a flower! Imagine the Bhagavan!

01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:13.520
In the books of the Vishnu is written
He is the one who is fond of flowers.

01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:18.000
The Goddess is the fond of flowers,
She’s the one who is fond of lotus.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.120
She sits in the lotus, She can’t live
without the flowers –

01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:24.800
I can’t exist without flowers!
And this fellow is,

01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:30.960
have you ever heard any saintly person
to take flowers for that person?

01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:36.000
Can’t you see that? What he wants
is gutters, he can’t bear the perfumes,

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.080
he must have gutters.

01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:42.240
Dirty fellow he is. Send him to some
bathroom and dump him down there.

01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:46.080
He’s already gone to his doom,
don’t you worry.

01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:49.920
Horrible dirty, filthy man. Useless.

01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:53.200
You must show them this film:
have you got it? Oh, you must see.

01:15:53.200 --> 01:16:02.560
It shows all the nonsense and horrible
stuff going on in the ashram.

01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:05.280
You must see.

01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:08.080
The film was called: “The God who has fled”.

01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:11.200
“The God who has fled”.

01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:13.920
He ran away from India, and now he’s
hiding somewhere near the desert…

01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:18.320
And your media has even got time to come
and see that! You see, what to do with

01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:21.360
these horrible media that you have here?

01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:28.560
But the best part of it they published
the advertisement, somebody told Me,

01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:35.200
in the Time magazine of London,
and you know Time magazine is closed permanently.

01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:39.600
Is closed. They are inauspicious people.
These clothes are inauspicious.

01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:46.800
I hope I’ll be able to give realization
but with these clothes I don’t know.

01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:50.400
I don’t know.

01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:05.360
What about praying for somebody
who is false?

01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:08.320
You see, when you are praying,
to whom are you praying?

01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:12.000
To God, alright?
You should be first connected or not?

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:15.600
We are praying without our connection,
like we are telephoning without the connection

01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:18.160
established, we spoil that telephone also.

01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:23.680
Better first when you are connected,
then even if you say it once it works out.

01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:27.600
But you should be connected. You must
enter into the kingdom of God.

01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:32.240
For example I am not an American citizen,
I have no right as an American citizen,

01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:32.960
isn’t it?

01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:35.840
You have to become the citizen
of God’s kingdom,

01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:40.640
then you have every right to ask
for anything, otherwise you have no right.

01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:43.520
Unless and until you become a Spirit,
you don’t have any right,

01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:48.160
whatever you may say. And if you say:
“I’m that, I’m that”,

01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:55.920
people will put you in the jail.
That’s what it is. You have to become.

01:17:55.920 --> 01:18:01.343
Then the prayer has meaning.

01:18:01.343 --> 01:18:04.313
Krishna has said clearly that should be
Ananya Bhakti.

01:18:04.313 --> 01:18:07.200
Ananya means when there is not the other,
when you are connected;

01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:09.440
that should be the time
when you can worship.

01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:13.280
But I see the Hare Rama people,
till they get their throat cancer,

01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:18.320
they are busy with that:
what am I to do?

01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:26.640
They are not called orange:
they are called what? Skinheads.

01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:30.960
And they are selling in the market
that stuff, you know, which they wear here.

01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:34.629
And they put that down, like a little
hair coming out here you see.

01:18:34.629 --> 01:18:37.200
Like a wig.
Wig. Is a special wig, Hare Rama wig.

01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:42.080
And they dance in that Oxford Circus
and it’s shameful to see their,

01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:45.040
they wear those saris and dhotis
and everything falls down,

01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:48.560
and they are dancing like mad,
“We are mad in the love of Shri Krishna”.

01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:57.440
Imagine. What a caricature.

01:18:57.440 --> 01:19:03.440
And their guru used to look like one of
our jockeys called Leslie Piggott:

01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:07.200
have you seen his face?
Imagine worshipping Shri Krishna

01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:08.080
looking like that.

01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:14.080
Actually Vishuddhi gives you a face,
a special face, Vishuddhi should.

01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:19.280
But the face he had was all kinds of
wrinkles all over, all over the places,

01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:20.560
just like Leslie Piggott.

01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:24.320
He could be a good jockey
but he’s died now.

01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:28.480
Is the person calling himself
as “God’s devotee”.

01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:36.480
Imagine, a shame for God also
to have such devotees who are TB patients.

01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:41.760
Are other gurus today negative
like Sai Baba?

01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:49.840
Which one, this with the hair?
He is horrible, he is a big devil.

01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:55.840
Ah, horrible. There are real gurus also,
I wouldn’t say that they are all horrible.

01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:58.800
They are in the market.
The real ones are there, many are there,

01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:00.160
but they are not in the market.

01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:03.920
One of them I asked him to come here,
he stayed in New York only for two days

01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:08.080
and ran away. He wouldn’t stay here.

01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:11.840
But they are very hard taskmasters.
There are.

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:16.800
And you will become: why are you worried
about anybody else?

01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:22.240
You are going to become even better gurus
than they are.

01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:26.000
About what?

01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:29.360
Ramana Maharshi.

01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:30.720
He was a realized soul.

01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:33.520
He was a realized soul.

01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:40.080
No doubt. That’s true, but not his disciples,
are horrid.

01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:47.920
No, he was a realized soul,
like Christ Himself was an incarnation Himself,

01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:50.960
but His disciples, the Christians,
God save us from them.

01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:53.360
What about Ramakrishna?

01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:58.320
Not at all, he was not a realized soul.
He was a seeker like you.

01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:01.040
But he, how he did everything
it was too much.

01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:04.560
I mean, what was the need to cry
like this all the time like a madman,

01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:07.680
he was dancing and all that?
There was no need to do all this drama,

01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:09.600
I think he was a very dramatic.

01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:15.120
His was more like a devotional style.
Too much left.

01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:21.120
Too much left. Nonsense. You know,
God must have been fed up with such people.

01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:26.320
Like My granddaughter: we had a,
in the neighborhood there was a temple.

01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:32.720
And they were dancing and singing like that.
So she told Me: “Grandma, you see,

01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:35.360
God must have already run away
from that temple no doubt,

01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:37.680
now I’m going to run away,
I’m fed up of these people”.

01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:41.920
You know, you should not pester God
also like this. This is too much.

01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:44.240
And what right have you got?
One thing is that,

01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:49.360
supposing if I want to meet your President,
supposing, I even want to meet your President

01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:50.640
I must have a proper protocol.

01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:54.640
I just cannot go and start shouting:
“Oh President, oh President”,

01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:58.560
as if he is in My pocket.
In the same way this is nonsense,

01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:03.280
absolute nonsense.

01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:05.200
You can see yourself.

01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:11.920
Ramakrishna ashram people mostly
dying of cancer, I must say. Cancer.

01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:16.640
Cancer has taken over, I must say,
I’m sorry, but at least I must have seen

01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:20.720
at least hundred cases,
at least hundred cases from that,

01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:22.240
who are coming with cancer.

01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:25.680
I mean, he’s left-sided.

01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:30.640
And this Satya Sai Baba, this devil –
the real one was there,

01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:38.760
Shirdi Sai Nath was real. But the second
one, the one who is, he gives you heart attacks.

01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:43.040
May I ask You about Sri Aurobindo?

01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:44.160
Aurobindo.

01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:45.360
What do you think?

01:22:57.760 --> 01:22:58.800
That’s your answer.

01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:06.480
That French woman of his,
was a drunkard.

01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:12.480
The French woman he had was a drunkard.
And she used to collect nothing but diamonds.

01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:16.880
And she had such big huge diamonds.
And she was going to become young after some time.

01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:20.160
God knows what happened to her now,
she’s finished.

01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:23.760
And they used to say, if you have to come
to their ashram,

01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:29.120
then you must give all your assets
to these “Johnnies”,

01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:32.640
Aurobindo and his mother
or whatever relationship they had,

01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:33.760
all nonsense.

01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:41.440
That’s what it is!

01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:44.800
This means you are a seeker and you are
becoming aware of the negativity.

01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:53.040
Horrible they are.
Absolutely horrible people.

01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:55.680
They make you mad.

01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:13.440
I mean, this is nothing.

01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:18.800
He has given blisters to people all over.
Ask your people,

01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:24.000
all of you should really write
to your newspapers and things and ask them,

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:28.960
“What are you doing about this man?”.
How can he buy anything? You should prohibit.

01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:33.120
In India why doesn’t he buy anything?
He can’t. He can’t.

01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:43.200
The government just put down their foot.

01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:48.000
The more realized that you become,
do you become like doctors?

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:52.240
Of course, of course, the doctors
have no place there,

01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:55.360
you save all your money
from the doctors and all that.

01:24:55.360 --> 01:25:00.800
You become the doctor! You should
become more healthy, you should become

01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:05.840
more wise, you should become more alert,
you should become more dynamic,

01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:12.800
you should become control
over everyone else. See?

01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:16.000
No more you are greedy. I mean,
it’s a different thing,

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:23.680
your priorities change completely.
That’s what you deserve.

01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:27.200
That’s what you are.
That’s what you should have.

01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:31.120
You have earned it! This is your bank
balance I’m telling you about.

01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:41.840
I’m here just to sign your checks.
If you have the bank balance.

01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:45.440
That’s what you are.

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:48.560
What is Your role in helping one
realize himself?

01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:49.280
What is My…?

01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:52.560
What is your role in all this,
in helping one realize oneself?

01:25:56.720 --> 01:25:58.880
I don’t know what is My role is.
I don’t know.

01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:03.040
What do you do to make it rise,
the Kundalini?

01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:04.960
I don’t do anything either.

01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:11.600
No no no, I’ll tell you what. Is simple:
now, will you ask the sun “what is your role”?

01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:14.480
It is the sun, it has to do it,
just do it.

01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:18.560
You better do it. What can you do,
it’s your nature!

01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:23.280
It’s My nature, I mean,
there’s no role as such, it’s nature.

01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:26.720
What can I do: it just happens!

01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:36.160
I enjoy, I enjoy.
I want to share My enjoyment.

01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:42.000
You are My children,
I have to give it to you.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:52.560
Is My love, I enjoy My love: that’s all.

01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:56.160
It’s rather difficult to understand
a person like that, isn’t it?

01:26:56.160 --> 01:27:00.320
But there is One: can be One like that.

01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:06.560
In all this mess there can be One like that,
who just does it out of love.

01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:09.680
That’s, that’s –
it’s just love and compassion.

01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:19.600
Is ocean of compassion.
I can’t get over it, I’m sorry.

01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:24.800
I have a very good husband,
very good family,

01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:29.840
I’m a very happily married woman,
everything is there,

01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:33.200
but without you I cannot enjoy life:
cannot.

01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:37.200
You all have to get it, it’s My job,
it’s My mission, it’s,

01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:40.480
that’s how I’m here,
that’s how I’m created.

01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:42.240
I’m just made for this.

01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:46.640
I’m fixed for it, in American language.

01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:50.160
Or we can say: all set for it. Alright?

01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:54.880
There’s no role, nothing:
it’s just I’m set, I have to do it.

01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:01.200
No method, no thing.

01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:05.600
As far as… there’s a Divine method,
you see, which cannot be explained,

01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:11.920
in ordinary words – like you cannot explain
how a flower becomes a fruit. Alright?

01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:19.584
But I raise your Kundalini
by My own raising.

01:28:19.584 --> 01:28:19.600
Beg Your pardon?

01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:25.120
By raising My own Kundalini.
I put your Kundalini on top of My Kundalini.

01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:28.960
This is an immaculate, you can say,
immaculate rebirth.

01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:35.520
I put you in My heart and give you
realization from My Sahasrara. Alright?

01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:40.160
But how I do it, that I can’t tell you.
But you will also do it.

01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:45.760
Once you get it, your vibrations
will do it automatically.

01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:49.440
How long does it take?

01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:54.000
Oh, split of a second!
Just split of a second, but if you are alright.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:57.520
Otherwise I have to cleanse you little bit.

01:28:57.520 --> 01:28:58.240
You have to do what?

01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:03.200
I have to cleanse you a little bit. Alright?

01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:05.760
I felt very hot when I asked You
that silly question…

01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:20.279
So I’m willing… here You’ll be showing…
I do not know what to do…,

01:29:20.279 --> 01:29:22.160
but we’ll find out!

01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:23.440
Ah, that’s it.

01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:27.360
Here in America She’s going to establish
a group, all of you could get together…

01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:31.120
No, Herman has offered his place
for this thing, very sweet of him,

01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:35.520
to have offered it. No, Herman
has offered his place

01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:39.520
and I’m going to sanctify it,
I’m going to see the place and all that,

01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:42.160
and we’ll start our centre there.

01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:46.160
Christine is here, she’s a very old
sahaja yogini in the sense that

01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:51.920
she came to Me one of the first seven
I had, for four years, she’s one of them.

01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:54.080
And she knows a lot about Sahaj Yog.

01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:59.920
Then in Boston we’ve got Steve
and you all are going to grow very fast –

01:29:59.920 --> 01:30:05.360
and we’ve got here another one Christine
who is in Boston,

01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:10.880
then I don’t know about Tracy if she’s
going to come down and settle down here.

01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:16.640
And also, who else? Is Marsha,
but Marsha has now gone to Philadelphia

01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:19.440
and she is going back to England,
then she is going to come back

01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:22.080
with her husband and settle down
in Philadelphia.

01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:28.320
So you are going to have these people here
to help you and give whatever guidance you need.

01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:34.080
And you yourself will start
understanding it very well. Very soon.

01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:38.800
Four-five days are sufficient
to equip you.

01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:44.880
So the reaction comes to you as heat,
you see, if you try to be…

01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:54.000
Alright, I didn’t do anything,
I’m just sitting here, am I doing anything?

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:57.680
Alright, now let’s have it.

01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:04.960
Yes, please, that’s what is the simplest
thing to understand.

01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:12.960
Now, can I remove this part of the thing
that is hanging onto My neck?

01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:18.320
What, has it improved anything?
I don’t know: did it?

01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:20.000
It’s for the television.

01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:29.920
Aah! That’s the one! I don’t understand
all these things.

01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:34.560
Whatever you say I will do:
only thing be satisfied.

01:31:34.560 --> 01:31:42.640
Right? Good, is there, still is there,
not lost.

01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:45.760
I think I have it most of the time
at home now.

01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:53.600
She thinks she has it all the time.

01:31:53.600 --> 01:32:00.800
Good, good, keep it up. Keep it up.
And then I’ll tell you everything

01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:02.640
about your theology later on, alright?

01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:13.920
Alright. I’ll tell you all about it.
All about it.

01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:18.560
Slowly, slowly you will know everything.
You see, there are many things which are true

01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:31.866
and many things which are false.
And with vibrations you can verify it.

01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:43.600
Ah. Nobody could be more aware of it
than Me.

01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:48.400
And some terrible things are going on
in Christianity, they are destroying people.

01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:56.080
You don’t know how much concern I have.
You have no idea.

01:32:57.440 --> 01:33:01.417
I mean, you can’t say that,
is both ways, everywhere just the same,

01:33:01.417 --> 01:33:03.680
I’m very aware of it,
I’m very aware of it.

01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:12.080
Jesus Christ came in that fashion,
and it brings such disgrace.

01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:22.800
I’m very much concerned,
very much concerned on My own level

01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:29.360
and work things out in My own way.

01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:33.600
And I was a nun for ten years,
I mean, I have seen horrible things.

01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:37.680
She was a nun for ten years,
contemplative nun.

01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:44.960
I mean, I got in such spiritual pain…
I suffered, and I saw no reason that I had

01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:52.720
for that suffering, but I saw and I mean,
it was awful, it was terrible.

01:33:52.720 --> 01:34:01.520
I know, I know that.
You know this Pope of yours,

01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:09.920
I went to Cracow, I went with My husband
to Cracow, just before,

01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:14.400
before he became the Pope.
And you see, he’s a big man,

01:34:14.400 --> 01:34:17.040
so they took Me, they said:
“What are you interested in?”.

01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:20.160
I said: “I’m interested in churches”,
so they took Me to Cracow.

01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:22.880
And they had a mass, you see,
this fellow came and shook My hand

01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:26.480
and I raised his Kundalini alright,
and it pierced through also.

01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:30.880
But it again went back,
because he’s a Christian like that.

01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:35.840
And I worked on him quite a lot,
but you know what happened?

01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:38.960
Recently there was a photograph of Pope.

01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:43.440
And his hand came out like this
and the hand is missing, this hand is missing.

01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:47.760
I know, I know what you are saying,
I know about this.

01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:51.840
And that photograph was published,
they don’t know how it was published.

01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:56.387
Then they have seen these points.
And Rome, in Rome people are very much

01:34:56.387 --> 01:35:00.754
against him. Very much against
all institutions, it’s nonsense, they know.

01:35:00.754 --> 01:35:01.360
Horrible.

01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:04.640
We have somebody here,
whom you should talk to,

01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:08.000
then he’ll tell you about it,
and the one who wrote this book “Advent”.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:11.760
He was, he was also wanting to become
a priest and all that,

01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:17.840
and he is very much against it.

01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:22.640
Actually against Catholicism I spoke
about three, two years back, isn’t it?

01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:36.160
In your wedding I spoke. Very much.

01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:37.120
Lutheran.

01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:37.840
Pardon?

01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:42.880
Lutheran. I was baptized by Lutherans.

01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:49.680
And then – then My father was a member
of the Church of Scotland, Presbyterian.

01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:52.080
I have no background,
neither My father had.

01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:56.080
My father was a very learned man,
and a very evolved soul, you see.

01:35:56.080 --> 01:36:00.800
He knew 14 languages, then he had
mastered Sanskrit language and all that.

01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:19.040
She thinks You are from Madhya Pradesh,
You are not from Madhra Pradesh.

01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:23.680
No, actually that time that Madhya Pradesh
was in Maharashtra. Now it’s on its own.

01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:26.320
You see, that part is Maharashtra.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:42.320
That is the center of India.
That hill station is the center of India.

01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:46.160
That’s where I was born.
In the Tropic of Cancer.

01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:47.520
I know India very well.&nbsp;

01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:53.200
That particular area is&nbsp;
about 50 miles from Nagpur…

01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:54.786
That’s the place is placed
on the Tropic of Cancer,

01:36:55.171 --> 01:36:57.204
Mecca is also Tropic of Cancer.
