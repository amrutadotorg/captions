October 9, 1987
Mahalakshmi Puja, Belgium

10:25.080 --> 10:38.133
It was so very nice to come to Belgium and
have so many people for our program and I

10:38.133 --> 10:50.633
must say, now we are getting to people who
are very sensitive.

10:50.633 --> 11:12.693
[translation follows - yes] It is a .. it
is a new dimension I think, I feel, we are

11:12.693 --> 11:15.773
entering into.

11:15.773 --> 11:26.743
Because now we are really getting people who
are seriously interested in their realization

11:26.743 --> 11:33.112
and are very respectful.

11:33.112 --> 11:35.673
And that aggressiveness is much less.

11:35.673 --> 11:44.123
You don’t find anybody being aggressive.

11:44.123 --> 11:59.312
So we can say, that now the road is paved
for all of you to work it out in a Sahaj manner

11:59.312 --> 12:12.352
to bring them properly to Sahaja Yoga and
settle them nicely.

12:12.352 --> 12:20.123
Now this Sahaj manner should be understood.

12:20.123 --> 12:28.133
In a Sahaj manner, when they come to you,
you must know they are absolutely new to Sahaja

12:28.133 --> 12:31.783
Yoga.

12:31.783 --> 12:40.332
So first and foremost thing, you should not
talk about Me.

12:40.332 --> 12:57.093
You should not tell them anything about Me;
but you have to tell them about Sahaja Yoga

12:57.093 --> 13:01.123
and about yourself.

13:01.123 --> 13:07.052
Like you can say, “I had the same problem
as you have.”

13:07.052 --> 13:20.442
Or you can say that “See, it took me more
time then it

13:20.442 --> 13:21.483
took you.”

13:21.483 --> 13:26.823
It’s a little lie, but doesn’t matter.

13:26.823 --> 13:31.752
[Shri Mataji laughs.]

13:31.752 --> 13:42.242
You see, because first of all, you must understand
human beings.

13:42.242 --> 13:50.814
If you tell them directly “You are bad”
or “You are evil; you are bootish” then

13:50.814 --> 13:57.272
they will run away, though it is true.

13:57.272 --> 14:03.093
A lady from France came to see Me.

14:03.093 --> 14:12.993
She said that “They told me I’m evil.”

14:12.993 --> 14:14.853
So I said, “No, no you are not.

14:14.853 --> 14:17.183
Who told you that?”

14:17.183 --> 14:25.933
And gradually she improved.

14:25.933 --> 14:36.123
So you have to tell them that “You are the
Spirit” and whatever is hanging on to them

14:36.123 --> 14:52.383
will be dropped out
and will be cleared out by their Kundalini.

14:52.383 --> 15:04.423
So if that happens they feel happy and they
get their benevolence.

15:04.423 --> 15:12.372
It is how beautifully you handle another person.

15:12.372 --> 15:18.313
Now there maybe people who want to argue.

15:18.313 --> 15:25.583
With them you should say, “You know, you
cannot argue it out, because it is beyond

15:25.583 --> 15:33.833
human awareness.”

15:33.833 --> 15:41.763
And you better tell them that it is … “You
better take your Realization, then we will

15:41.763 --> 15:44.853
talk about it.

15:44.853 --> 15:48.723
Not before your Realization.”

15:48.723 --> 15:55.253
So then, if they are not getting any Realization,
you don’t tell them that “There is a bhoot

15:55.253 --> 16:01.793
sitting in your left Nabhi or right Nabhi.”

16:01.793 --> 16:13.363
This is our language – Sahaja Yogi’s language,
not their language.

16:13.363 --> 16:24.092
Ya, so you have to be very careful to handle
them very carefully.

16:24.092 --> 16:31.693
Now there could be a problem between, say,
a sad man’s parent’s mother and a daughter

16:31.693 --> 16:34.522
or maybe husband and wife.

16:34.522 --> 16:35.583
So …

16:35.583 --> 16:49.263
(Just a minute, this side - listen to Me,
all right?

16:49.263 --> 16:52.663
All of you should pay attention to Me.

16:52.663 --> 16:54.652
All right?

16:54.652 --> 16:59.633
No, no it’s all right.

16:59.633 --> 17:00.633
Let her be there.

17:00.633 --> 17:05.513
It’s all right, but she should pay attention
this time, all right?

17:05.513 --> 17:07.673
Sit down.)

17:07.673 --> 17:16.152
So we have to tell them that “You carry
on, don’t worry about it, because the inner

17:16.152 --> 17:31.302
joy will start giving you strength.”

17:31.302 --> 17:39.643
Then gradually the another partner will understand
you -

17:39.643 --> 17:49.413
see you’re honest, your purpose and would
try to appreciate you.

17:49.413 --> 17:52.803
Gradually it works out.

17:52.803 --> 18:07.543
But if it does not, then we’ll see about
it.

18:07.543 --> 18:20.573
Now when you handle them with love and care,
you can establish them.

18:20.573 --> 18:33.312
But if they start misbehaving you also should
not lose temper at all.

18:33.312 --> 18:37.812
You should be very forgiving.

18:37.812 --> 18:49.742
Now I must say, that in Sahaja Yoga you have
to respect your leaders.

18:49.742 --> 18:52.522
Of course, you might not find them perfect,
maybe.

18:52.522 --> 19:12.543
Or maybe
you may find them to be little bossy, possibly.

19:12.543 --> 19:17.113
But you need some bossing sometimes.

19:17.113 --> 19:30.153
And leaders must know how to also correct
people, because you need correction.

19:30.153 --> 19:40.713
I met a lady, I was telling you, we had told
them, that you need not have a guru.

19:40.713 --> 19:47.973
So, she said “No, no we must have somebody
to guide us.

19:47.973 --> 20:01.113
And that guru will guide us and also will
support us, so we would like to follow him.

20:01.113 --> 20:08.702
In spite of the fact he is a very bossy fellow
and he always gets annoyed with us and he

20:08.702 --> 20:10.223
takes money from us.

20:10.223 --> 20:35.373
And it’s not a guru, if he’s not, if he
is very soft, means he should not be kind.”

20:35.373 --> 20:46.153
So we have another kind also of people who
want somebody to dominate

20:46.153 --> 20:50.413
them for their spiritual ascent.

20:50.413 --> 21:01.593
They are better people, because they want
their ascent in any case.

21:01.593 --> 21:08.523
And they accept corrections, because they
want their ascent.

21:08.523 --> 21:10.433
That’s the first thing.

21:10.433 --> 21:23.533
So even if the leader bosses, they like it
very much.

21:23.533 --> 21:39.583
In some places people told Me, “Our guru
is very soft – we must get some strong fellow.”

21:39.583 --> 22:00.702
So I leave it to the leaders, who are called
as gurus by some people to be kind, compassionate,

22:00.702 --> 22:04.223
good.

22:04.223 --> 22:13.603
But should not compromise with nonsense and
laziness.

22:13.603 --> 22:21.343
Because the first thing, people get into is
laziness after Sahaja Yoga.

22:21.343 --> 22:28.963
We have to be committed.

22:28.963 --> 22:37.012
Now I too have a family and I have grandchildren.

22:37.012 --> 22:40.053
My daughter has come all the way to see Me
in London.

22:40.053 --> 22:51.002
She’s been there for one month and I haven’t
been there yet.

22:51.002 --> 22:58.433
She’s waiting for Me.

22:58.433 --> 23:02.213
So it’s all right, one has to do it.

23:02.213 --> 23:12.083
This is My commitment, because this is your
purpose of life.

23:12.083 --> 23:28.023
And the purpose that you have mainly is to
ascend and help others to ascend.

23:28.023 --> 23:36.943
You are special people, who have to do such
a tremendous task.

23:36.943 --> 23:45.952
Otherwise how can we have lots of people coming
to Sahaja Yoga?

23:45.952 --> 23:57.743
So the Sahaja way is to yourself improve with
meditation

23:57.743 --> 24:06.103
and introspect yourself and see yourself.

24:06.103 --> 24:17.512
You must meditate and you should not see the
defects of others.

24:17.512 --> 24:25.543
The second thing to be Sahaj is to be collective.

24:25.543 --> 24:37.913
If you do not meet collectively every day,
then there will be a problem.

24:37.913 --> 24:40.442
In the collective only the maturity starts.

24:40.442 --> 24:49.723
It is a living process as I told you.

24:49.723 --> 24:59.643
Now supposing a tree is growing and you take
out a leaf from there and the leaf will say,

24:59.643 --> 25:02.593
“I’m going to grow by myself.”

25:02.593 --> 25:08.413
It cannot grow.

25:08.413 --> 25:16.512
It will be left out.

25:16.512 --> 25:23.273
So that is what one has to remember: that
it is a collective happening.

25:23.273 --> 25:31.463
We all have to meet and grow together.

25:31.463 --> 25:46.803
Now, those who are not collective will disappear
one day into thin air, like a dead leaf.

25:46.803 --> 25:57.543
I think people don’t understand the meaning
of collective happening.

25:57.543 --> 26:09.153
It is just like a tree growing and with the
tree everything else that belongs to tree

26:09.153 --> 26:13.723
also grows.

26:13.723 --> 26:22.983
So for the growth of this tree one has to
remember that you have to stick onto the tree.

26:22.983 --> 26:35.752
But the tree is not going to run after you,
“Stick on, stick on to me, stick on to me.”

26:35.752 --> 26:45.543
For that whatever has to be done, has to be
done.

26:45.543 --> 26:55.283
You know, when the winter comes, all the leaves
fall off.

26:55.283 --> 27:02.983
What they do is to create a barrier between
themselves and the tree by some living process.

27:02.983 --> 27:15.093
They create a barrier in between, there's
a little bark that comes in between.

27:15.093 --> 27:29.883
Now when that happens the leaves fall off
and the tree becomes barren.

27:29.883 --> 27:34.123
Now same thing happens in Sahaja Yoga.

27:34.123 --> 27:45.703
When you do not accept the principle of Sahaja
Yoga you put a barrier in between the sap

27:45.703 --> 27:58.443
and
the leaf.

27:58.443 --> 28:05.653
Now when that happens, the leaf falls off.

28:05.653 --> 28:16.953
So you have to open out yourself, your heart,
everything to suck in the sap to nourish.

28:16.953 --> 28:30.393
You have to give up your Ego and Superego,
your conditionings and ideas you have had

28:30.393 --> 28:34.723
from before.

28:34.723 --> 28:46.683
This is what is the surrender, is the Islam.

28:46.683 --> 28:50.423
And that is to be achieved.

28:50.423 --> 28:59.093
But that is not going to help the tree, it
is going to help you.

28:59.093 --> 29:04.303
Now some people say, “I'm not ready.”

29:04.303 --> 29:07.923
Then how will you grow?

29:07.923 --> 29:17.563
Actually when a little child is born, immediately
it wants to suck in the mother's nourishment.

29:17.563 --> 29:36.053
It feels it has starved all this time and
it should suck mother's milk immediately.

29:36.053 --> 29:44.923
And all those are seekers, once they find
their Realization must behave in that manner.

29:44.923 --> 29:55.143
They should all give up all the conditionings
and all these nonsensical ideas and immediately

29:55.143 --> 30:15.903
push themselves and also cleanse themselves
fully to suck in more and more of this nourishment.

30:15.903 --> 30:20.513
But it does not happen that way.

30:20.513 --> 30:28.943
That's why some people do not grow that fast.

30:28.943 --> 30:38.853
It is a pure intelligence that gives you that
sense I think.

30:38.853 --> 30:49.023
Pure intelligence comes from pure heart and
if you pay more attention to your heart, your

30:49.023 --> 30:56.623
Spirit, then it will work out.

30:56.623 --> 31:10.943
In the course of your movement in Sahaja Yoga
you will see you’ll be blessed.

31:10.943 --> 31:22.003
Not only that you’ll have the blessings
but you will have jobs, you will have money

31:22.003 --> 31:31.333
or else children will pass with flying colors.

31:31.333 --> 31:35.463
They will become obedient.

31:35.463 --> 31:50.063
Your health will improve, you will get money,
you will get married, you will have nice children,

31:50.063 --> 32:03.133
wise wife, you’ll get homes and ashrams.

32:03.133 --> 32:08.953
But these are all temptations.

32:08.953 --> 32:16.413
Many people get lost in one of those.

32:16.413 --> 32:30.073
Now supposing I've to catch the plane and
on the way I see very nice gardens or things,

32:30.073 --> 32:43.103
then I get down to enjoy the gardens, how
will I reach the airport and the aeroplane?

32:43.103 --> 32:50.863
So these temptations must be seen as just
entertainments…

32:50.863 --> 32:57.753
as entertainments.

32:57.753 --> 33:08.083
Entertainment, all right?

33:08.083 --> 33:25.633
Now our understanding of Sahaj is simple if
you do not think about it.

33:25.633 --> 33:32.373
But if you start thinking you’ll go mad.

33:32.373 --> 33:45.593
How can you explain that a person just like
you can give Realization to thousands?

33:45.593 --> 33:56.313
How can you explain that you can see the sun
on My heart in a picture?

33:56.313 --> 34:00.853
All this pictures which are there, how can
you explain?

34:00.853 --> 34:10.023
For example, you get My photographs in the
sky, is a fact.

34:10.023 --> 34:17.043
How will you explain that?

34:17.043 --> 34:22.313
So it is beyond your brains.

34:22.313 --> 34:26.623
So better not think about it.

34:26.623 --> 34:29.263
Just gradually accept the joy.

34:29.263 --> 34:41.653
I always say I've done the cooking for you
and very good food.

34:41.653 --> 34:51.223
Now only thing is for you to eat it and taste
it.

34:51.223 --> 34:59.393
Why do you want to know, how it was cooked,
when it was kept and what else has been done

34:59.393 --> 35:09.923
to make it so tasty?

35:09.923 --> 35:16.903
You should just appreciate and enjoy.

35:16.903 --> 35:23.023
Like a painting you have, you don't think,
“From where did he get the paint, how did

35:23.023 --> 35:39.023
he paint and how was he sitting, what food
he must have taken, before or after?”

35:39.023 --> 35:48.993
But in Sahaja Yoga we do these ridiculous
things, you know.

35:48.993 --> 35:58.913
It's very surprising, that people do not understand
one simple thing: that Kundalini has risen

35:58.913 --> 36:09.343
without thinking and not by our effort.

36:09.343 --> 36:22.413
The Kundalini has given us this good health,
good temperament and has changed us so much.

36:22.413 --> 36:32.943
So She is going to do the job, only thing
we should try to support Her and to keep our

36:32.943 --> 36:37.373
central path clean.

36:37.373 --> 36:43.333
It's very simple.

36:43.333 --> 36:50.713
So now I feel very much encouraged to that
from Holland and from Belgium we have such

36:50.713 --> 36:56.673
nice Sahaja Yogis here, and also I would say
it is rather difficult for some people to

36:56.673 --> 36:58.193
come to India.

36:58.193 --> 37:04.943
But try to come, because those who have been
to India have settled down much better, because

37:04.943 --> 37:33.813
India has got something magical about it,
that it transforms people to a deeper level.

37:33.813 --> 38:07.003
You should not come half heartedly.

38:07.003 --> 38:11.753
I feel that those who can come on [literally??

38:11.753 --> 38:16.743
– UNCLEAR] should not find excuses, “I'm
not ready, I'm not thinking”, because such

38:16.743 --> 38:22.723
half hearted people are not going to gain
anything.

38:22.723 --> 38:34.293
You
have to come with full force, as I told you

38:34.293 --> 38:45.903
the newly born child, otherwise it is useless.

38:45.903 --> 38:53.723
Don't play into the tricks of your mind.

38:53.723 --> 39:06.263
It's like a donkey - if you take a donkey
lightly, then it will just start grazing anywhere

39:06.263 --> 39:08.543
it finds grass.

39:08.543 --> 39:24.403
And if it knows that the person sitting on
his back is a lousy fellow or a lazy person,

39:24.403 --> 39:30.393
it will drop him.

39:30.393 --> 39:43.743
And when it knows that it can go ahead of
the person then it can even kick you back.

39:43.743 --> 39:48.193
That is how your mind is.

39:48.193 --> 40:03.563
It dominates you, it sometimes starts grazing
on pastures and you think that's a very good

40:03.563 --> 40:16.633
thing, you are very peaceful or else it starts
dominating you.

40:16.633 --> 40:19.383
So how to manage this donkey?

40:19.383 --> 40:30.853
Best way is to catch hold of the ears, and
carry it with you.

40:30.853 --> 40:39.983
Donkey is for you, you are not for the donkey.

40:39.983 --> 40:51.363
So this is one of the hurdles, that we have
very much.

40:51.363 --> 41:01.343
As far as you all are concerned you have to
know that Sahaja Yoga is to be understood

41:01.343 --> 41:06.333
not by brain, but by heart.

41:06.333 --> 41:22.223
I have known people who can give big lectures
on Sahaja Yoga, can write books, but have

41:22.223 --> 41:24.753
no vibrations.

41:24.753 --> 41:27.433
So this is not the way Sahaja Yoga is.

41:27.433 --> 41:34.543
You have to be a Yogi.

41:34.543 --> 41:37.713
That's a religion in a way in our being.

41:37.713 --> 41:46.873
That's the religion of a Yogi.

41:46.873 --> 41:58.342
Like human beings have ten valencies, a Yogi
must have at least eleven valencies.

41:58.342 --> 42:08.943
And the eleventh valency integrates you with
the religion.

42:08.943 --> 42:30.173
You get identified with righteousness, with
compassion, with love, with assiduity - perseverance

42:30.173 --> 42:43.933
- or also detachment.

42:43.933 --> 42:49.023
That means you do not expect anything.

42:49.023 --> 42:53.743
You do it for doing’s sake.

42:53.743 --> 42:58.093
You love for loving’s sake.

42:58.093 --> 43:01.443
That's the best way to enjoy.

43:01.443 --> 43:04.393
You enjoy your loving capacity.

43:04.393 --> 43:12.313
You enjoy your generosity.

43:12.313 --> 43:18.463
You enjoy your forgiveness.

43:18.463 --> 43:25.733
Enjoy all these great qualities of righteousness.

43:25.733 --> 43:35.583
You’ll never feel hurt.

43:35.583 --> 43:41.293
I do that all the time.

43:41.293 --> 43:46.923
That's how I'm always happy and full of joy.

43:46.923 --> 43:50.983
May God bless you!
