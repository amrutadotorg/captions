00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:05.810
October 9, 1987
Mahalakshmi Puja, Belgium

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:38.133
It was so very nice to come to Belgium and
have so many people for our program and I

00:10:38.133 --> 00:10:50.633
must say, now we are getting to people who
are very sensitive.

00:10:50.633 --> 00:11:12.693
[translation follows - yes] It is a .. it
is a new dimension I think, I feel, we are

00:11:12.693 --> 00:11:15.773
entering into.

00:11:15.773 --> 00:11:26.743
Because now we are really getting people who
are seriously interested in their realization

00:11:26.743 --> 00:11:33.112
and are very respectful.

00:11:33.112 --> 00:11:35.673
And that aggressiveness is much less.

00:11:35.673 --> 00:11:44.123
You don’t find anybody being aggressive.

00:11:44.123 --> 00:11:59.312
So we can say, that now the road is paved
for all of you to work it out in a Sahaj manner

00:11:59.312 --> 00:12:12.352
to bring them properly to Sahaja Yoga and
settle them nicely.

00:12:12.352 --> 00:12:20.123
Now this Sahaj manner should be understood.

00:12:20.123 --> 00:12:28.133
In a Sahaj manner, when they come to you,
you must know they are absolutely new to Sahaja

00:12:28.133 --> 00:12:31.783
Yoga.

00:12:31.783 --> 00:12:40.332
So first and foremost thing, you should not
talk about Me.

00:12:40.332 --> 00:12:57.093
You should not tell them anything about Me;
but you have to tell them about Sahaja Yoga

00:12:57.093 --> 00:13:01.123
and about yourself.

00:13:01.123 --> 00:13:07.052
Like you can say, “I had the same problem
as you have.”

00:13:07.052 --> 00:13:20.442
Or you can say that “See, it took me more
time then it

00:13:20.442 --> 00:13:21.483
took you.”

00:13:21.483 --> 00:13:26.823
It’s a little lie, but doesn’t matter.

00:13:26.823 --> 00:13:31.752
[Shri Mataji laughs.]

00:13:31.752 --> 00:13:42.242
You see, because first of all, you must understand
human beings.

00:13:42.242 --> 00:13:50.814
If you tell them directly “You are bad”
or “You are evil; you are bootish” then

00:13:50.814 --> 00:13:57.272
they will run away, though it is true.

00:13:57.272 --> 00:14:03.093
A lady from France came to see Me.

00:14:03.093 --> 00:14:12.993
She said that “They told me I’m evil.”

00:14:12.993 --> 00:14:14.853
So I said, “No, no you are not.

00:14:14.853 --> 00:14:17.183
Who told you that?”

00:14:17.183 --> 00:14:25.933
And gradually she improved.

00:14:25.933 --> 00:14:36.123
So you have to tell them that “You are the
Spirit” and whatever is hanging on to them

00:14:36.123 --> 00:14:52.383
will be dropped out
and will be cleared out by their Kundalini.

00:14:52.383 --> 00:15:04.423
So if that happens they feel happy and they
get their benevolence.

00:15:04.423 --> 00:15:12.372
It is how beautifully you handle another person.

00:15:12.372 --> 00:15:18.313
Now there maybe people who want to argue.

00:15:18.313 --> 00:15:25.583
With them you should say, “You know, you
cannot argue it out, because it is beyond

00:15:25.583 --> 00:15:33.833
human awareness.”

00:15:33.833 --> 00:15:41.763
And you better tell them that it is … “You
better take your Realization, then we will

00:15:41.763 --> 00:15:44.853
talk about it.

00:15:44.853 --> 00:15:48.723
Not before your Realization.”

00:15:48.723 --> 00:15:55.253
So then, if they are not getting any Realization,
you don’t tell them that “There is a bhoot

00:15:55.253 --> 00:16:01.793
sitting in your left Nabhi or right Nabhi.”

00:16:01.793 --> 00:16:13.363
This is our language – Sahaja Yogi’s language,
not their language.

00:16:13.363 --> 00:16:24.092
Ya, so you have to be very careful to handle
them very carefully.

00:16:24.092 --> 00:16:31.693
Now there could be a problem between, say,
a sad man’s parent’s mother and a daughter

00:16:31.693 --> 00:16:34.522
or maybe husband and wife.

00:16:34.522 --> 00:16:35.583
So …

00:16:35.583 --> 00:16:49.263
(Just a minute, this side - listen to Me,
all right?

00:16:49.263 --> 00:16:52.663
All of you should pay attention to Me.

00:16:52.663 --> 00:16:54.652
All right?

00:16:54.652 --> 00:16:59.633
No, no it’s all right.

00:16:59.633 --> 00:17:00.633
Let her be there.

00:17:00.633 --> 00:17:05.513
It’s all right, but she should pay attention
this time, all right?

00:17:05.513 --> 00:17:07.673
Sit down.)

00:17:07.673 --> 00:17:16.152
So we have to tell them that “You carry
on, don’t worry about it, because the inner

00:17:16.152 --> 00:17:31.302
joy will start giving you strength.”

00:17:31.302 --> 00:17:39.643
Then gradually the another partner will understand
you -

00:17:39.643 --> 00:17:49.413
see you’re honest, your purpose and would
try to appreciate you.

00:17:49.413 --> 00:17:52.803
Gradually it works out.

00:17:52.803 --> 00:18:07.543
But if it does not, then we’ll see about
it.

00:18:07.543 --> 00:18:20.573
Now when you handle them with love and care,
you can establish them.

00:18:20.573 --> 00:18:33.312
But if they start misbehaving you also should
not lose temper at all.

00:18:33.312 --> 00:18:37.812
You should be very forgiving.

00:18:37.812 --> 00:18:49.742
Now I must say, that in Sahaja Yoga you have
to respect your leaders.

00:18:49.742 --> 00:18:52.522
Of course, you might not find them perfect,
maybe.

00:18:52.522 --> 00:19:12.543
Or maybe
you may find them to be little bossy, possibly.

00:19:12.543 --> 00:19:17.113
But you need some bossing sometimes.

00:19:17.113 --> 00:19:30.153
And leaders must know how to also correct
people, because you need correction.

00:19:30.153 --> 00:19:40.713
I met a lady, I was telling you, we had told
them, that you need not have a guru.

00:19:40.713 --> 00:19:47.973
So, she said “No, no we must have somebody
to guide us.

00:19:47.973 --> 00:20:01.113
And that guru will guide us and also will
support us, so we would like to follow him.

00:20:01.113 --> 00:20:08.702
In spite of the fact he is a very bossy fellow
and he always gets annoyed with us and he

00:20:08.702 --> 00:20:10.223
takes money from us.

00:20:10.223 --> 00:20:35.373
And it’s not a guru, if he’s not, if he
is very soft, means he should not be kind.”

00:20:35.373 --> 00:20:46.153
So we have another kind also of people who
want somebody to dominate

00:20:46.153 --> 00:20:50.413
them for their spiritual ascent.

00:20:50.413 --> 00:21:01.593
They are better people, because they want
their ascent in any case.

00:21:01.593 --> 00:21:08.523
And they accept corrections, because they
want their ascent.

00:21:08.523 --> 00:21:10.433
That’s the first thing.

00:21:10.433 --> 00:21:23.533
So even if the leader bosses, they like it
very much.

00:21:23.533 --> 00:21:39.583
In some places people told Me, “Our guru
is very soft – we must get some strong fellow.”

00:21:39.583 --> 00:22:00.702
So I leave it to the leaders, who are called
as gurus by some people to be kind, compassionate,

00:22:00.702 --> 00:22:04.223
good.

00:22:04.223 --> 00:22:13.603
But should not compromise with nonsense and
laziness.

00:22:13.603 --> 00:22:21.343
Because the first thing, people get into is
laziness after Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:21.343 --> 00:22:28.963
We have to be committed.

00:22:28.963 --> 00:22:37.012
Now I too have a family and I have grandchildren.

00:22:37.012 --> 00:22:40.053
My daughter has come all the way to see Me
in London.

00:22:40.053 --> 00:22:51.002
She’s been there for one month and I haven’t
been there yet.

00:22:51.002 --> 00:22:58.433
She’s waiting for Me.

00:22:58.433 --> 00:23:02.213
So it’s all right, one has to do it.

00:23:02.213 --> 00:23:12.083
This is My commitment, because this is your
purpose of life.

00:23:12.083 --> 00:23:28.023
And the purpose that you have mainly is to
ascend and help others to ascend.

00:23:28.023 --> 00:23:36.943
You are special people, who have to do such
a tremendous task.

00:23:36.943 --> 00:23:45.952
Otherwise how can we have lots of people coming
to Sahaja Yoga?

00:23:45.952 --> 00:23:57.743
So the Sahaja way is to yourself improve with
meditation

00:23:57.743 --> 00:24:06.103
and introspect yourself and see yourself.

00:24:06.103 --> 00:24:17.512
You must meditate and you should not see the
defects of others.

00:24:17.512 --> 00:24:25.543
The second thing to be Sahaj is to be collective.

00:24:25.543 --> 00:24:37.913
If you do not meet collectively every day,
then there will be a problem.

00:24:37.913 --> 00:24:40.442
In the collective only the maturity starts.

00:24:40.442 --> 00:24:49.723
It is a living process as I told you.

00:24:49.723 --> 00:24:59.643
Now supposing a tree is growing and you take
out a leaf from there and the leaf will say,

00:24:59.643 --> 00:25:02.593
“I’m going to grow by myself.”

00:25:02.593 --> 00:25:08.413
It cannot grow.

00:25:08.413 --> 00:25:16.512
It will be left out.

00:25:16.512 --> 00:25:23.273
So that is what one has to remember: that
it is a collective happening.

00:25:23.273 --> 00:25:31.463
We all have to meet and grow together.

00:25:31.463 --> 00:25:46.803
Now, those who are not collective will disappear
one day into thin air, like a dead leaf.

00:25:46.803 --> 00:25:57.543
I think people don’t understand the meaning
of collective happening.

00:25:57.543 --> 00:26:09.153
It is just like a tree growing and with the
tree everything else that belongs to tree

00:26:09.153 --> 00:26:13.723
also grows.

00:26:13.723 --> 00:26:22.983
So for the growth of this tree one has to
remember that you have to stick onto the tree.

00:26:22.983 --> 00:26:35.752
But the tree is not going to run after you,
“Stick on, stick on to me, stick on to me.”

00:26:35.752 --> 00:26:45.543
For that whatever has to be done, has to be
done.

00:26:45.543 --> 00:26:55.283
You know, when the winter comes, all the leaves
fall off.

00:26:55.283 --> 00:27:02.983
What they do is to create a barrier between
themselves and the tree by some living process.

00:27:02.983 --> 00:27:15.093
They create a barrier in between, there's
a little bark that comes in between.

00:27:15.093 --> 00:27:29.883
Now when that happens the leaves fall off
and the tree becomes barren.

00:27:29.883 --> 00:27:34.123
Now same thing happens in Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:34.123 --> 00:27:45.703
When you do not accept the principle of Sahaja
Yoga you put a barrier in between the sap

00:27:45.703 --> 00:27:58.443
and
the leaf.

00:27:58.443 --> 00:28:05.653
Now when that happens, the leaf falls off.

00:28:05.653 --> 00:28:16.953
So you have to open out yourself, your heart,
everything to suck in the sap to nourish.

00:28:16.953 --> 00:28:30.393
You have to give up your Ego and Superego,
your conditionings and ideas you have had

00:28:30.393 --> 00:28:34.723
from before.

00:28:34.723 --> 00:28:46.683
This is what is the surrender, is the Islam.

00:28:46.683 --> 00:28:50.423
And that is to be achieved.

00:28:50.423 --> 00:28:59.093
But that is not going to help the tree, it
is going to help you.

00:28:59.093 --> 00:29:04.303
Now some people say, “I'm not ready.”

00:29:04.303 --> 00:29:07.923
Then how will you grow?

00:29:07.923 --> 00:29:17.563
Actually when a little child is born, immediately
it wants to suck in the mother's nourishment.

00:29:17.563 --> 00:29:36.053
It feels it has starved all this time and
it should suck mother's milk immediately.

00:29:36.053 --> 00:29:44.923
And all those are seekers, once they find
their Realization must behave in that manner.

00:29:44.923 --> 00:29:55.143
They should all give up all the conditionings
and all these nonsensical ideas and immediately

00:29:55.143 --> 00:30:15.903
push themselves and also cleanse themselves
fully to suck in more and more of this nourishment.

00:30:15.903 --> 00:30:20.513
But it does not happen that way.

00:30:20.513 --> 00:30:28.943
That's why some people do not grow that fast.

00:30:28.943 --> 00:30:38.853
It is a pure intelligence that gives you that
sense I think.

00:30:38.853 --> 00:30:49.023
Pure intelligence comes from pure heart and
if you pay more attention to your heart, your

00:30:49.023 --> 00:30:56.623
Spirit, then it will work out.

00:30:56.623 --> 00:31:10.943
In the course of your movement in Sahaja Yoga
you will see you’ll be blessed.

00:31:10.943 --> 00:31:22.003
Not only that you’ll have the blessings
but you will have jobs, you will have money

00:31:22.003 --> 00:31:31.333
or else children will pass with flying colors.

00:31:31.333 --> 00:31:35.463
They will become obedient.

00:31:35.463 --> 00:31:50.063
Your health will improve, you will get money,
you will get married, you will have nice children,

00:31:50.063 --> 00:32:03.133
wise wife, you’ll get homes and ashrams.

00:32:03.133 --> 00:32:08.953
But these are all temptations.

00:32:08.953 --> 00:32:16.413
Many people get lost in one of those.

00:32:16.413 --> 00:32:30.073
Now supposing I've to catch the plane and
on the way I see very nice gardens or things,

00:32:30.073 --> 00:32:43.103
then I get down to enjoy the gardens, how
will I reach the airport and the aeroplane?

00:32:43.103 --> 00:32:50.863
So these temptations must be seen as just
entertainments…

00:32:50.863 --> 00:32:57.753
as entertainments.

00:32:57.753 --> 00:33:08.083
Entertainment, all right?

00:33:08.083 --> 00:33:25.633
Now our understanding of Sahaj is simple if
you do not think about it.

00:33:25.633 --> 00:33:32.373
But if you start thinking you’ll go mad.

00:33:32.373 --> 00:33:45.593
How can you explain that a person just like
you can give Realization to thousands?

00:33:45.593 --> 00:33:56.313
How can you explain that you can see the sun
on My heart in a picture?

00:33:56.313 --> 00:34:00.853
All this pictures which are there, how can
you explain?

00:34:00.853 --> 00:34:10.023
For example, you get My photographs in the
sky, is a fact.

00:34:10.023 --> 00:34:17.043
How will you explain that?

00:34:17.043 --> 00:34:22.313
So it is beyond your brains.

00:34:22.313 --> 00:34:26.623
So better not think about it.

00:34:26.623 --> 00:34:29.263
Just gradually accept the joy.

00:34:29.263 --> 00:34:41.653
I always say I've done the cooking for you
and very good food.

00:34:41.653 --> 00:34:51.223
Now only thing is for you to eat it and taste
it.

00:34:51.223 --> 00:34:59.393
Why do you want to know, how it was cooked,
when it was kept and what else has been done

00:34:59.393 --> 00:35:09.923
to make it so tasty?

00:35:09.923 --> 00:35:16.903
You should just appreciate and enjoy.

00:35:16.903 --> 00:35:23.023
Like a painting you have, you don't think,
“From where did he get the paint, how did

00:35:23.023 --> 00:35:39.023
he paint and how was he sitting, what food
he must have taken, before or after?”

00:35:39.023 --> 00:35:48.993
But in Sahaja Yoga we do these ridiculous
things, you know.

00:35:48.993 --> 00:35:58.913
It's very surprising, that people do not understand
one simple thing: that Kundalini has risen

00:35:58.913 --> 00:36:09.343
without thinking and not by our effort.

00:36:09.343 --> 00:36:22.413
The Kundalini has given us this good health,
good temperament and has changed us so much.

00:36:22.413 --> 00:36:32.943
So She is going to do the job, only thing
we should try to support Her and to keep our

00:36:32.943 --> 00:36:37.373
central path clean.

00:36:37.373 --> 00:36:43.333
It's very simple.

00:36:43.333 --> 00:36:50.713
So now I feel very much encouraged to that
from Holland and from Belgium we have such

00:36:50.713 --> 00:36:56.673
nice Sahaja Yogis here, and also I would say
it is rather difficult for some people to

00:36:56.673 --> 00:36:58.193
come to India.

00:36:58.193 --> 00:37:04.943
But try to come, because those who have been
to India have settled down much better, because

00:37:04.943 --> 00:37:33.813
India has got something magical about it,
that it transforms people to a deeper level.

00:37:33.813 --> 00:38:07.003
You should not come half heartedly.

00:38:07.003 --> 00:38:11.753
I feel that those who can come on [literally??

00:38:11.753 --> 00:38:16.743
– UNCLEAR] should not find excuses, “I'm
not ready, I'm not thinking”, because such

00:38:16.743 --> 00:38:22.723
half hearted people are not going to gain
anything.

00:38:22.723 --> 00:38:34.293
You
have to come with full force, as I told you

00:38:34.293 --> 00:38:45.903
the newly born child, otherwise it is useless.

00:38:45.903 --> 00:38:53.723
Don't play into the tricks of your mind.

00:38:53.723 --> 00:39:06.263
It's like a donkey - if you take a donkey
lightly, then it will just start grazing anywhere

00:39:06.263 --> 00:39:08.543
it finds grass.

00:39:08.543 --> 00:39:24.403
And if it knows that the person sitting on
his back is a lousy fellow or a lazy person,

00:39:24.403 --> 00:39:30.393
it will drop him.

00:39:30.393 --> 00:39:43.743
And when it knows that it can go ahead of
the person then it can even kick you back.

00:39:43.743 --> 00:39:48.193
That is how your mind is.

00:39:48.193 --> 00:40:03.563
It dominates you, it sometimes starts grazing
on pastures and you think that's a very good

00:40:03.563 --> 00:40:16.633
thing, you are very peaceful or else it starts
dominating you.

00:40:16.633 --> 00:40:19.383
So how to manage this donkey?

00:40:19.383 --> 00:40:30.853
Best way is to catch hold of the ears, and
carry it with you.

00:40:30.853 --> 00:40:39.983
Donkey is for you, you are not for the donkey.

00:40:39.983 --> 00:40:51.363
So this is one of the hurdles, that we have
very much.

00:40:51.363 --> 00:41:01.343
As far as you all are concerned you have to
know that Sahaja Yoga is to be understood

00:41:01.343 --> 00:41:06.333
not by brain, but by heart.

00:41:06.333 --> 00:41:22.223
I have known people who can give big lectures
on Sahaja Yoga, can write books, but have

00:41:22.223 --> 00:41:24.753
no vibrations.

00:41:24.753 --> 00:41:27.433
So this is not the way Sahaja Yoga is.

00:41:27.433 --> 00:41:34.543
You have to be a Yogi.

00:41:34.543 --> 00:41:37.713
That's a religion in a way in our being.

00:41:37.713 --> 00:41:46.873
That's the religion of a Yogi.

00:41:46.873 --> 00:41:58.342
Like human beings have ten valencies, a Yogi
must have at least eleven valencies.

00:41:58.342 --> 00:42:08.943
And the eleventh valency integrates you with
the religion.

00:42:08.943 --> 00:42:30.173
You get identified with righteousness, with
compassion, with love, with assiduity - perseverance

00:42:30.173 --> 00:42:43.933
- or also detachment.

00:42:43.933 --> 00:42:49.023
That means you do not expect anything.

00:42:49.023 --> 00:42:53.743
You do it for doing’s sake.

00:42:53.743 --> 00:42:58.093
You love for loving’s sake.

00:42:58.093 --> 00:43:01.443
That's the best way to enjoy.

00:43:01.443 --> 00:43:04.393
You enjoy your loving capacity.

00:43:04.393 --> 00:43:12.313
You enjoy your generosity.

00:43:12.313 --> 00:43:18.463
You enjoy your forgiveness.

00:43:18.463 --> 00:43:25.733
Enjoy all these great qualities of righteousness.

00:43:25.733 --> 00:43:35.583
You’ll never feel hurt.

00:43:35.583 --> 00:43:41.293
I do that all the time.

00:43:41.293 --> 00:43:46.923
That's how I'm always happy and full of joy.

00:43:46.923 --> 00:43:50.983
May God bless you!
