00:02:46.734 --> 00:02:53.350
Yesterday, in the lecture, I gave a

00:02:53.551 --> 00:02:56.900
new announcement about Sahaja Yoga.

00:02:57.101 --> 00:03:01.110
But the whole lecture was in Marathi language

00:03:01.311 --> 00:03:04.737
and before it is translated

00:03:04.938 --> 00:03:09.070
I would like to tell you what was my announcement.

00:03:09.271 --> 00:03:14.043
There was a question that, in America and in England,

00:03:14.244 --> 00:03:22.134
no trust which is not a religion can be registered.

00:03:22.335 --> 00:03:26.805
Of course, Sahaja Yoga is the religion, no doubt,

00:03:27.006 --> 00:03:28.422
is the universal religion,

00:03:28.623 --> 00:03:31.750
is a religion that integrates all the religion,

00:03:31.951 --> 00:03:34.846
brings all the principles of religions together

00:03:35.047 --> 00:03:40.411
and shows the - shows the oneness.

00:03:40.612 --> 00:03:43.324
It integrates all the incarnations.

00:03:43.525 --> 00:03:46.608
It integrates all the scriptures.

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:49.657
It's a very integrating great religion

00:03:49.858 --> 00:03:52.691
which we can call as the universal religion and,

00:03:52.892 --> 00:03:56.015
in Hindi, it is called as Vishwa Dharma.

00:03:56.216 --> 00:04:00.770
Now to make it more particular,

00:04:00.971 --> 00:04:04.713
I thought that if you say universal religion

00:04:04.914 --> 00:04:08.749
then it may not be that particular because like the Buddhist,

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.102
then we have got people who are called

00:04:12.303 --> 00:04:14.380
after Christ as Christians

00:04:14.581 --> 00:04:18.261
and after other people according to the incarnations.

00:04:18.462 --> 00:04:21.395
So this time the incarnation being Nirmala,

00:04:21.596 --> 00:04:23.567
I thought we can call it

00:04:23.768 --> 00:04:28.591
"The Religion which is Universal, in the name of Nirmala."

00:04:28.792 --> 00:04:31.370
So to make it short, I thought we can call it

00:04:31.571 --> 00:04:35.953
"Universal Nirmala Religion". What do you say to that?

00:04:41.567 --> 00:04:46.959
Now Nirmala, you'll be all called as 'Nirmalites'.

00:04:50.178 --> 00:04:55.511
Is the one who have been enlightened by Nirmala,

00:04:55.712 --> 00:04:57.445
it goes, light shabda (word) goes,

00:04:57.646 --> 00:05:00.573
the word light goes very well with you people

00:05:00.774 --> 00:05:02.075
because you are enlightened.

00:05:02.276 --> 00:05:05.143
Others are just lights without any flame.

00:05:05.344 --> 00:05:07.318
So this is Nirmalites,

00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:10.993
means the ones who are being enlightened by Nirmala.

00:05:11.194 --> 00:05:12.625
So if you like the name,

00:05:12.826 --> 00:05:16.719
we can call it 'Universal Nirmala Religion'.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.179
If that suits your people in the west,

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.062
I think that's a good name. So we have now proclaimed

00:05:24.263 --> 00:05:26.663
and pronounced that this is a religion

00:05:26.864 --> 00:05:30.333
which is a pure universal religion.

00:05:30.534 --> 00:05:32.688
When you say Universal Nirmala

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:36.917
means pure or immaculate religion.

00:05:38.152 --> 00:05:41.661
And I hope you are agreeable to that.

00:05:41.862 --> 00:05:44.002
Now, once we accept that religion,

00:05:44.203 --> 00:05:46.345
once we become universal

00:05:46.546 --> 00:05:50.261
then we have to forget about our small little caste,

00:05:50.462 --> 00:05:56.481
customs, our old dead traditions

00:05:56.682 --> 00:06:03.841
and the things that are not keeping with our spirit.

00:06:04.042 --> 00:06:06.323
Whatever is comfortable to your spirit

00:06:06.524 --> 00:06:12.014
has to be accepted as the principle of our religion.

00:06:12.215 --> 00:06:15.220
And whatever is not comfortable for it,

00:06:15.421 --> 00:06:17.851
we are not going to accept.

00:06:18.052 --> 00:06:22.669
So whatever is the way I have brought you,

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.350
these are my teachings. Out of my teachings,

00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:29.563
whatever you have achieved, belongs to this religion.

00:06:29.764 --> 00:06:31.699
Of course in this religion, as you know,

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.713
all the great prophets are really respected.

00:06:34.914 --> 00:06:37.570
The best advantage of this religion is ki (that), so far,

00:06:37.771 --> 00:06:39.915
all the religions, though they were true religions,

00:06:40.116 --> 00:06:43.104
were established by true people and prophets,

00:06:43.305 --> 00:06:46.434
were all ruined by their disciples.

00:06:46.635 --> 00:06:49.915
The reason was they were not given realization, firstly,

00:06:50.116 --> 00:06:56.013
and secondly there was no proof of that religion.

00:06:56.214 --> 00:06:59.131
Now we can give them the proof of everything,

00:06:59.332 --> 00:07:03.182
of how it is doing good to your body.

00:07:03.383 --> 00:07:07.645
Once you know that you can prove it, that it does good to you,

00:07:07.846 --> 00:07:11.293
then people will take to this religion much faster

00:07:11.494 --> 00:07:12.636
and they can test it.

00:07:12.837 --> 00:07:15.794
Because the word 'religion' makes people quite nervous.

00:07:15.995 --> 00:07:18.041
They think religion means you are binding

00:07:18.242 --> 00:07:22.858
and then you have to get into some sort of a

00:07:23.059 --> 00:07:25.427
traditional style of living which is dead.

00:07:25.628 --> 00:07:28.921
But here our traditions are that we accept

00:07:29.122 --> 00:07:32.970
which are comfortable for our spirit and for our ascent.

00:07:33.171 --> 00:07:36.386
So that gives us the complete freedom

00:07:36.587 --> 00:07:39.873
to enjoy ourselves in the fullest way.

00:07:40.074 --> 00:07:47.248
Under these circumstances, we forget what country we come from,

00:07:47.449 --> 00:07:51.382
what caste we come from,

00:07:51.583 --> 00:07:53.858
what families we come from,

00:07:54.059 --> 00:07:57.087
all these past things we forget and we become

00:07:57.288 --> 00:07:59.990
new blossoming lotuses

00:08:00.191 --> 00:08:04.212
spreading our beautiful fragrance all over the world.

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:08.588
So all these old ideas

00:08:08.789 --> 00:08:14.296
which are just curbing our progress should be given up.

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:16.830
Now, I told them another thing: that

00:08:17.031 --> 00:08:20.530
we are three types of people in this world, mainly divided into,

00:08:20.731 --> 00:08:26.239
one are people who are tamasik, another people who are the rajasik,

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.832
NOW BE QUIET AND OBSERVE.

00:08:28.033 --> 00:08:32.657
and the third person is the one who is called as sattvikas.

00:08:32.858 --> 00:08:38.749
Now tamasik are people, as we say that, they take wrong things,

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:41.879
attach attention more to the wrong things

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.998
and then waste all their life.

00:08:45.199 --> 00:08:47.521
They will say, for example, a woman,

00:08:47.722 --> 00:08:49.445
she gets attached to her son,

00:08:49.646 --> 00:08:51.567
she gets so much attached to that son

00:08:51.775 --> 00:08:54.671
that that covers all entire activities,

00:08:54.878 --> 00:08:58.642
her whole life is covered with that, which is a wrong thing.

00:08:58.843 --> 00:09:01.262
It can be anything. Like I've seen most of the Sahaja yogis

00:09:01.463 --> 00:09:03.259
when they come, "Mother, please treat my sister,

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:06.582
please treat my father, treat my husband, my husband, ..."

00:09:06.783 --> 00:09:08.459
My husband is very common.

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:14.155
So all these things are absolutely frivolous and flippant.

00:09:14.356 --> 00:09:20.631
So those people who indulge into such petty things

00:09:20.832 --> 00:09:23.002
which are wrong and waste their life

00:09:23.203 --> 00:09:26.216
are the people who are tamasikas. So that's one extreme.

00:09:26.417 --> 00:09:29.408
The goodness about it that such people are loving,

00:09:29.609 --> 00:09:33.330
they're affectionate, they are kindly, they are not aggressive,

00:09:33.531 --> 00:09:37.623
but they are so much attached to their family life

00:09:37.824 --> 00:09:38.978
and family things

00:09:39.179 --> 00:09:42.458
that to them it is only the family and nothing else.

00:09:42.659 --> 00:09:47.166
Now these people being extremely left sided

00:09:47.367 --> 00:09:49.148
have much more children than normal.

00:09:49.349 --> 00:09:52.728
That's why in India we have more children.

00:09:53.877 --> 00:09:58.064
Now the another style is the western style is called the rajasik.

00:09:58.265 --> 00:10:01.675
Now the rajasik are the people who are the ones

00:10:01.876 --> 00:10:04.950
who do not know what is right and wrong.

00:10:05.151 --> 00:10:07.820
They are, they think they are the wisest in the whole world

00:10:08.021 --> 00:10:10.796
and they said, "This is also good, that is also good."

00:10:10.997 --> 00:10:14.083
As Satan is also good, and God is also good.

00:10:14.284 --> 00:10:17.373
They go on like this, you see, as if they are very generous people,

00:10:17.574 --> 00:10:19.922
they are very kindly, trying to show off.

00:10:20.123 --> 00:10:22.541
But such people become extremely right sided.

00:10:22.742 --> 00:10:24.987
Especially their women become very right sided.

00:10:25.188 --> 00:10:26.952
As soon as the women become right sided,

00:10:27.153 --> 00:10:30.081
the men loose their potency, I should say.

00:10:30.282 --> 00:10:33.202
Because the women start dominating them all the time

00:10:33.403 --> 00:10:37.626
so men become just like cabbages. You see that very clearly.

00:10:38.287 --> 00:10:40.384
And the women decide for everything,

00:10:40.585 --> 00:10:42.774
they'll sit on their heads, they'll take a decision

00:10:42.975 --> 00:10:46.025
and the men start accepting everything, "All right, all right"

00:10:46.226 --> 00:10:49.937
because they want peace at any cost.

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:55.893
But there is nothing like "right," so they are confused.

00:10:56.094 --> 00:10:57.475
You ask anybody, "I am confused."

00:10:57.676 --> 00:10:59.350
They are not ashamed to say that also.

00:10:59.551 --> 00:11:01.393
In India if someone says, "I'm confused,"

00:11:01.594 --> 00:11:04.188
they'll say, "Go to the lunatic asylum."

00:11:04.389 --> 00:11:06.841
But, they say, "I'm confused,"

00:11:07.042 --> 00:11:10.576
because by that they try to show that I'm very aware ---

00:11:10.777 --> 00:11:12.635
because I'm confused, you see?

00:11:12.836 --> 00:11:15.189
That's not the sign. You must know the right path.

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:16.889
How are you confused?

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:20.491
If you don't know the right path then something wrong with your brain.

00:11:20.692 --> 00:11:22.118
And that's what happens that the people,

00:11:22.319 --> 00:11:25.542
as a result of not deciding this, not deciding that,

00:11:25.743 --> 00:11:28.300
all the time wavering, this is good, that is good,

00:11:28.501 --> 00:11:30.845
should I do this or should I not do that.

00:11:31.046 --> 00:11:33.592
They become really stupid sometimes.

00:11:33.793 --> 00:11:36.488
To them, it's alright if they have to puncture

00:11:36.689 --> 00:11:41.475
their cheeks with nails

00:11:41.676 --> 00:11:45.009
or some pins or something like that,

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:48.203
which you call as punks or something.

00:11:48.404 --> 00:11:49.763
That's also good. It's alright.

00:11:49.964 --> 00:11:51.469
After all, "what's wrong, what's wrong?"

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:53.255
Let them be punks, you see?

00:11:53.456 --> 00:11:57.728
All sorts of stupid idiotic things they do.

00:11:57.929 --> 00:12:00.118
And they become such idiots, I tell you.

00:12:00.319 --> 00:12:04.168
And for them, nothing is wrong. They will aggress another person.

00:12:04.369 --> 00:12:08.036
They'll go and aggress other countries

00:12:08.237 --> 00:12:13.168
and do all kinds of dominating,

00:12:13.369 --> 00:12:17.342
aggressive acts without feeling there's anything wrong in it.

00:12:17.543 --> 00:12:21.059
I mean, they loose all their guidelines. There's no discretion.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.859
There's no guideline. And they don't know how to go.

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:25.609
It's like a lost ship, you see.

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:29.852
But still, the worst part of it is that you think, "What's wrong?"

00:12:30.053 --> 00:12:33.813
I mean, if it is not silly, it is happy going to hell directly.

00:12:34.014 --> 00:12:37.389
That sort of a mentality develops and it's very dangerous.

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:40.986
Here, now, and naturally with this kind of right sided people,

00:12:41.187 --> 00:12:43.149
they don't produce children much.

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:46.383
They don't produce, that's why all these western countries

00:12:46.584 --> 00:12:49.496
are on the minus side because love part is missing.

00:12:49.697 --> 00:12:53.560
To them, love is also mechanical. Love is also a sort of a thing,

00:12:53.761 --> 00:12:57.063
"Let me think then I will love." Then they will write it down,

00:12:57.264 --> 00:12:58.946
I don't know what they do for their love also,

00:12:59.147 --> 00:13:02.480
must be planning how to love.

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:04.954
They loose all spontaneity.

00:13:05.155 --> 00:13:07.895
Being so much mechanized and thinking,

00:13:08.096 --> 00:13:11.022
they loose all the spontaneity of all the normal things

00:13:11.223 --> 00:13:13.179
and that's how they are like that.

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:15.928
All the time they are confused, they say "Oh! Have I done right?

00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:18.136
Have I done wrong? Should I do like this?"

00:13:18.337 --> 00:13:20.232
And they cannot enjoy anything.

00:13:20.433 --> 00:13:23.437
Because even if there is something you give them to eat,

00:13:23.638 --> 00:13:27.114
then they'll think, "Is it good or bad?"

00:13:27.659 --> 00:13:30.427
Eat it! See for yourself! Your tongue will tell you.

00:13:30.628 --> 00:13:34.302
But tongue also does the same, I think, in their case.

00:13:36.011 --> 00:13:38.003
It's such a confused state they are in.

00:13:38.204 --> 00:13:41.291
They cannot enjoy their marriages, they cannot enjoy their family life,

00:13:41.492 --> 00:13:45.134
they cannot enjoy anything. They are absolutely joyless

00:13:45.335 --> 00:13:49.220
and in a pursuit of joy they do all kinds of nonsensical things

00:13:49.421 --> 00:13:53.231
which are so stupid and so idiotic and so adharmic.

00:13:53.432 --> 00:13:57.097
Still they are never joyous. They'll say, "We are very joyous."

00:13:57.298 --> 00:13:59.757
Certify!

00:14:03.014 --> 00:14:05.819
All such clowns you must have seen around.

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:10.884
So now we don't belong to those clown stage so let us stand up

00:14:11.085 --> 00:14:14.223
and say that we know what is wrong, right and what is wrong.

00:14:14.424 --> 00:14:17.488
Don't stand wavering. If you are wavering like that

00:14:17.689 --> 00:14:20.793
then you are not a Sahaja yogi. Now stand on right path.

00:14:20.994 --> 00:14:23.913
Say that, "This is it and I'm going to do this."

00:14:24.114 --> 00:14:28.236
If you know that then you are sattvikas, then you are in the center.

00:14:28.437 --> 00:14:34.989
So you neither too much attached to your family, this, that,

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:38.281
neither you are too much attached to your own thinking

00:14:38.482 --> 00:14:41.271
and understanding but you are in the center

00:14:41.472 --> 00:14:45.654
where neither you think nor you worry

00:14:45.855 --> 00:14:50.335
but you stand in the center to enjoy the present moment,

00:14:50.536 --> 00:14:51.992
which is to be enjoyed.

00:14:52.193 --> 00:14:56.604
And so this is a spontaneous thing that has to come.

00:14:56.805 --> 00:15:00.433
Now there's a big cry for spontaneity in the west.

00:15:00.634 --> 00:15:05.219
How can they have spontaneity? They cannot have spontaneity,

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:07.767
that's why they think they pierce a little bit,

00:15:07.968 --> 00:15:11.255
some sensation is there, is good, they go in for sensation.

00:15:11.456 --> 00:15:14.570
Even in the newspapers they must have everyday some sensation

00:15:14.771 --> 00:15:18.939
because they are getting deadened with this kind of indecision.

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:21.360
So now you decide!

00:15:21.561 --> 00:15:24.897
And the decision only can come in a person

00:15:25.098 --> 00:15:29.192
who has developed that wisdom through understanding of Sahaja Yoga,

00:15:29.393 --> 00:15:34.512
through its Kundalini, that you have to stand in the center.

00:15:35.455 --> 00:15:37.800
Even in the case of marriage.

00:15:38.001 --> 00:15:40.498
Even if you marry them, after that,

00:15:40.699 --> 00:15:44.915
"I wonder Mother if I could carry on with her or with him."

00:15:45.116 --> 00:15:48.224
I said, "Why? Why are you wondering that?"

00:15:48.425 --> 00:15:51.766
"I think Mother ..."

00:15:52.384 --> 00:15:57.050
"Oh that's your wife! Enjoy it!"

00:15:58.066 --> 00:16:00.329
I've been busy fixing up marriages.

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:10.130
But I hope you will not neutralize all my efforts,

00:16:10.331 --> 00:16:13.376
all my trying. Because I still see some of them

00:16:13.577 --> 00:16:16.701
who are married look little miserable.

00:16:16.902 --> 00:16:20.765
Because you think, because you want them to be like this,

00:16:20.966 --> 00:16:23.490
they are what they are, try to enjoy!

00:16:23.691 --> 00:16:27.216
Now why do you want to change your wife and change your husband,

00:16:27.417 --> 00:16:30.584
change everything? You're married, that's the way she has to be.

00:16:30.785 --> 00:16:34.316
In any case, you'll be changing as you'll be growing old.

00:16:34.517 --> 00:16:37.642
So, one must understand that: "at every moment,

00:16:37.843 --> 00:16:40.162
how much I have enjoyed myself?"

00:16:40.363 --> 00:16:43.902
That's the test of a Sahaja yogi.

00:16:44.355 --> 00:16:47.379
Some people who are married must have had children before

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:49.085
because they've divorced.

00:16:49.286 --> 00:16:54.449
There may be some who might have had some other attachments.

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:57.007
Forget it!

00:16:57.369 --> 00:16:58.751
Forget it.

00:16:58.952 --> 00:17:02.185
Otherwise this miserable nature is not going to go away.

00:17:02.386 --> 00:17:05.226
So forget all that is miserable,

00:17:05.427 --> 00:17:09.065
come in the center and enjoy everything.

00:17:09.266 --> 00:17:13.287
Now, for the first time I'm venturing now to have widow marriages.

00:17:13.488 --> 00:17:17.992
In India widow marriage is something was tried long time back,

00:17:18.193 --> 00:17:22.478
people tried it but still one can say that

00:17:22.679 --> 00:17:25.002
it was not so successful.

00:17:25.203 --> 00:17:27.606
Now, if you have to have a Universal Religion,

00:17:27.807 --> 00:17:30.693
you have to marry people from one place to another.

00:17:30.894 --> 00:17:32.999
You have to! That's one of the things.

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:36.825
You, we call it roti biti, means you must eat food,

00:17:37.026 --> 00:17:41.580
in India I've seen people who won't even eat food

00:17:41.781 --> 00:17:43.833
I don't want to talk about it in India

00:17:44.034 --> 00:17:48.040
because they are so particular, when, with whom they eat the food.

00:17:48.241 --> 00:17:51.322
Their own relations also in that,

00:17:51.523 --> 00:17:53.747
if there is a little caste difference

00:17:53.948 --> 00:17:55.988
they will not eat food at their place.

00:17:56.189 --> 00:17:59.906
And with that what they have achieved is starvation.

00:18:00.107 --> 00:18:02.373
They don't mind starving.

00:18:02.574 --> 00:18:05.235
But they will not eat food at a particular caste

00:18:05.436 --> 00:18:08.641
because that's a different caste. Such stupid people live here also.

00:18:08.842 --> 00:18:11.915
So, this has to go away.

00:18:12.116 --> 00:18:14.448
Gandhiji tried, before that many people tried that

00:18:14.649 --> 00:18:15.831
you must marry outside

00:18:16.032 --> 00:18:17.685
but they didn't say marry in the foreign countries otherwise

00:18:17.886 --> 00:18:21.920
they would have been murdered ten times more.

00:18:22.173 --> 00:18:23.779
But now I'm saying,

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:26.846
it is now the Universal Religion we are talking about

00:18:27.047 --> 00:18:29.207
so we should accept these marriages

00:18:29.408 --> 00:18:34.384
and must keep the sanctity of the marriage.

00:18:37.074 --> 00:18:41.637
Now the ladies, I have to especially request you,

00:18:41.878 --> 00:18:44.347
now that you are the one who are going to mar

00:18:44.548 --> 00:18:46.682
or make Sahaja Yoga alright.

00:18:46.883 --> 00:18:51.792
If you try to dominate your husbands and overdo things,

00:18:51.993 --> 00:18:56.612
they are not going to be normal people and I don't want cabbages here.

00:18:58.524 --> 00:19:02.346
You have to become sweet,

00:19:02.547 --> 00:19:06.151
extremely sweet, nice, kindly and attentive.

00:19:06.352 --> 00:19:08.769
You see, that's how you can capture you husbands.

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:14.470
You don't know how to capture. You are stupid women, I must say.

00:19:16.324 --> 00:19:19.400
You see, how we, actually my husband if you ask him he'll say,

00:19:19.601 --> 00:19:24.156
"I'm so dependent, I don't know what to do."

00:19:25.542 --> 00:19:29.926
That's what it is, absolutely dependent, 100%.

00:19:30.127 --> 00:19:33.003
And then he sometimes gets angry, "You made me dependent,

00:19:33.204 --> 00:19:37.283
now how can you leave me and go away?"

00:19:37.696 --> 00:19:42.650
But you people have funny ideas, you are not men, you are women.

00:19:42.851 --> 00:19:46.874
You are much more powerful than men are.

00:19:47.075 --> 00:19:52.217
But stupidly if you want to become less powerful then become men.

00:19:52.552 --> 00:19:56.859
So the women should try to be little simpler,

00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:02.508
easier, kindly, compassionate, affectionate, let them dominate,

00:20:02.709 --> 00:20:07.002
they feel they're dominating, let them dominate.

00:20:08.112 --> 00:20:10.411
Doesn't matter. If, supposing your husband says,

00:20:10.612 --> 00:20:14.374
"Alright, I like the blue color." Alright, you buy the green

00:20:14.575 --> 00:20:18.114
say that this is blue, they'll believe you.

00:20:18.323 --> 00:20:22.259
They don't know green from the blue.

00:20:23.014 --> 00:20:24.283
You see, they don't know many things.

00:20:24.484 --> 00:20:28.357
You don't know, they don't know anything about life.

00:20:28.753 --> 00:20:31.562
The things that are important to you, they don't know,

00:20:31.763 --> 00:20:35.078
they just try to say "do this" but they don't know anything.

00:20:35.279 --> 00:20:37.457
I mean, at least our men are like that.

00:20:37.658 --> 00:20:40.015
Absolutely hopeless, they don't know anything.

00:20:40.216 --> 00:20:42.871
And if you tell them, alright, I am buying,

00:20:43.072 --> 00:20:46.643
supposing we say that we want to plant a mango tree.

00:20:46.844 --> 00:20:50.721
They say, "don't have a mango tree." "Then what should I have?"

00:20:50.922 --> 00:20:53.293
"Uh no, you should have another tree,

00:20:53.494 --> 00:20:56.692
" uh, some other name they'll give you. Supposing they'll say that,

00:20:56.893 --> 00:21:02.341
"Put some, uh, we can say, coconut tree."

00:21:02.542 --> 00:21:06.704
Now you know that you cannot plant coconut tree in a particular place.

00:21:06.905 --> 00:21:09.780
But they don't know that you cannot plant coconut tree.

00:21:09.981 --> 00:21:14.798
So you say, "alright, I'll put coconut." Then you put the mango there.

00:21:14.999 --> 00:21:18.752
"What a nice coconut tree," they'll say.

00:21:21.888 --> 00:21:23.962
And when the mangos will appear, you see,

00:21:24.163 --> 00:21:27.046
when the mangos will appear then they will look at them,

00:21:27.247 --> 00:21:31.399
"Oh! Our coconut tree has given mangos!

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:36.425
That's wonderful. Better, this is better." And then they will laugh.

00:21:39.821 --> 00:21:42.490
So you shouldn't, they are worried about bigger things

00:21:42.691 --> 00:21:48.849
like world peace, atomic bombs.

00:21:49.091 --> 00:21:51.521
You just don't worry about these big things.

00:21:51.722 --> 00:21:54.007
Let them worry about these big things, you see.

00:21:54.208 --> 00:21:56.980
And all, they will be worried about traffic lights,

00:21:57.181 --> 00:22:00.472
motor cars and all that let them worry.

00:22:00.673 --> 00:22:04.296
You worry about the things which concerns you.

00:22:04.497 --> 00:22:08.260
And you'll be surprised that this division of labor

00:22:08.461 --> 00:22:11.042
will bring more joy and more happiness.

00:22:11.243 --> 00:22:15.364
Like the nose has to smell, mouth has to eat, ears have to hear.

00:22:15.565 --> 00:22:18.606
But if somebody, that's what I've seen in the west that,

00:22:18.807 --> 00:22:20.462
everybody does everybody's work.

00:22:20.663 --> 00:22:23.487
You know, a president can be a garbage cleaner also.

00:22:23.688 --> 00:22:26.794
That is not done in India. Everybody has his own capacity.

00:22:26.995 --> 00:22:29.354
Of course nothing, no work is higher or lower,

00:22:29.555 --> 00:22:33.147
but whatever is your capacity you should do accordingly.

00:22:33.348 --> 00:22:36.341
Specially with ladies and men, this is very important.

00:22:36.542 --> 00:22:38.995
And if you have not learned how to be sweet,

00:22:39.196 --> 00:22:44.200
try to learn from some Indian women how they manage their husbands.

00:22:45.153 --> 00:22:47.939
Now, regarding the Sattvikas,

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:51.551
are the people who know what the right thing is.

00:22:51.752 --> 00:22:55.159
They are actually the category of the seekers.

00:22:55.360 --> 00:23:00.389
And such seekers automatically find the truth.

00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:02.876
They are the people who come to the right thing.

00:23:03.077 --> 00:23:08.977
They have a special sense, a special seventh sense,

00:23:09.178 --> 00:23:11.708
that sense gives them understanding.

00:23:11.909 --> 00:23:15.990
What we call a very deep penetration and a pure intelligence

00:23:16.191 --> 00:23:23.091
which gives them an understanding that this is the way it is.

00:23:23.292 --> 00:23:25.760
This is it.

00:23:25.961 --> 00:23:28.569
Of course some of them take time, because they are

00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:31.350
left sided or right sided, to come in the center.

00:23:31.551 --> 00:23:34.601
But even if they come to the center, they may just go to the right,

00:23:34.802 --> 00:23:37.924
they may go to the left, they may little bit go like that,

00:23:38.125 --> 00:23:42.014
but these are the people who come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:42.215 --> 00:23:44.515
Those who are extremes will never come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:44.716 --> 00:23:47.279
You should not try to pull them in,

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:50.247
specially men on the right,

00:23:50.448 --> 00:23:56.863
women on too much on the right or too much on the left,

00:23:57.064 --> 00:24:00.533
even the men who are too much on the left, like here in Nashik,

00:24:00.734 --> 00:24:03.016
I find people are so conditioned.

00:24:03.217 --> 00:24:06.078
If you are too much conditioned then, also,

00:24:06.279 --> 00:24:08.161
you cannot come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:08.362 --> 00:24:11.109
Now all such people, even if they come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:13.400
they'll stay for a short time and go away.

00:24:13.601 --> 00:24:17.239
That's why sometimes I say that such and such marriage won't be successful.

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.085
One should try to understand why Mother has said it.

00:24:20.286 --> 00:24:23.164
Because they will deliberately force that marriage on me,

00:24:23.365 --> 00:24:25.792
"Mother, no, we want to get married. We have decided."

00:24:25.993 --> 00:24:29.830
And within three days they'll come back for divorce.

00:24:30.031 --> 00:24:33.360
So one must understand why Mother has said that this won't work out.

00:24:33.561 --> 00:24:38.051
It's important, very important for us to know that

00:24:38.252 --> 00:24:42.886
there are many other things within ourselves which also work out.

00:24:43.852 --> 00:24:47.766
Now sometimes the men also can be extremely dominating

00:24:47.967 --> 00:24:52.705
that they should not - come inside, the dais is ending here.

00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:02.590
They should not be dominating also.

00:25:02.791 --> 00:25:05.714
I have seen that they get very dominating.

00:25:05.915 --> 00:25:08.002
Some of the men who have married Indian girls

00:25:08.203 --> 00:25:11.925
have become so dominating that I'm shocked, how did they learn it?

00:25:12.126 --> 00:25:15.051
And then try to tell the wife, "do this, do that, do that,"

00:25:15.252 --> 00:25:17.353
if she doesn't do it then they feel bad.

00:25:17.554 --> 00:25:19.598
Italians also have a habit, I have seen.

00:25:19.799 --> 00:25:23.741
They also dominate Italian women very much. And the Greeks too.

00:25:23.942 --> 00:25:26.701
Because they are suppose to be traditionalist like us, you see,

00:25:26.902 --> 00:25:30.032
Italians, Greeks and Egyptians and Indians.

00:25:30.233 --> 00:25:33.061
But Indians are the worst ...

00:25:33.262 --> 00:25:37.167
and I cannot number the rest. But they try to dominate their women.

00:25:37.368 --> 00:25:40.702
Money they will control, this they will control, that they will control,

00:25:40.903 --> 00:25:43.646
they will control the women, they can't control themselves.

00:25:43.847 --> 00:25:46.831
So, this is what one should not try to do.

00:25:47.032 --> 00:25:50.862
That when it comes to women, you must respect them.

00:25:51.063 --> 00:25:55.000
They are respectable. And if you cannot respect them,

00:25:55.201 --> 00:25:57.637
you cannot marry them and live with them.

00:25:57.838 --> 00:26:01.991
Now these people, who are very dominating, hot tempered,

00:26:02.192 --> 00:26:04.043
puzzled type of people,

00:26:04.244 --> 00:26:07.037
they actually spoil Sahaja yoginis, I've seen them.

00:26:07.238 --> 00:26:10.614
Very good Sahaj yoginis have been spoiled by such men.

00:26:10.815 --> 00:26:12.544
By marrying them, sometimes I feel:

00:26:12.745 --> 00:26:15.750
why did I marry this good girl to this horrible fellow?

00:26:15.951 --> 00:26:19.302
Because the girl, first of all, opposes such a man.

00:26:19.503 --> 00:26:23.159
She says, "Mother, I can't bear such a man. It's too much for me,

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:27.478
I just .. it's too much. He's too rustic.

00:26:27.679 --> 00:26:29.244
He behaves in a funny manner."

00:26:29.445 --> 00:26:32.995
And then she herself starts behaving in the same manner.

00:26:33.196 --> 00:26:36.754
Her language changes, style changes, it's something surprising!

00:26:36.955 --> 00:26:39.630
A person who is a good Sahaj yogini.

00:26:39.831 --> 00:26:42.616
Extremely good sahaj yogini and we have in London, we have in America.

00:26:42.817 --> 00:26:45.944
I've seen such girls. So I would request you that

00:26:46.145 --> 00:26:50.144
don't try to put your tempers and all those things on your wives

00:26:50.345 --> 00:26:54.136
because then they react and you will ruin their lives and their ascent,

00:26:54.337 --> 00:26:58.207
as well as yours, you have already ruined. Try to bring down.

00:26:58.408 --> 00:27:03.043
You have to be peaceful, loving, affectionate people.

00:27:03.244 --> 00:27:07.696
You have no reason to have any temper whatsoever.

00:27:09.347 --> 00:27:13.243
No temper, at all. So that is extremely important.

00:27:13.444 --> 00:27:16.451
You must remember that Krishna started with the temper.

00:27:16.652 --> 00:27:20.170
That how a person gets spoiled is through the temper.

00:27:20.371 --> 00:27:22.965
Temper not allowed. As soon as you get into temper,

00:27:23.174 --> 00:27:25.086
go and beat yourself with shoes. That's the best way

00:27:25.287 --> 00:27:27.099
or you cannot just go on beating there.

00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:29.912
So that no temper should be allowed to come up

00:27:30.113 --> 00:27:32.809
because this will spoil Sahaja Yoga out and out.

00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:39.483
Is not allowed to have any temper whatsoever at any cost.

00:27:39.684 --> 00:27:42.862
Except when your Mother has been ..

00:27:43.063 --> 00:27:45.702
of course then I cannot stop it because it's too much to expect ..

00:27:45.903 --> 00:27:49.084
when people abuse me, say bad thing you get into temper, doesn't matter.

00:27:49.285 --> 00:27:51.838
But even then you need not answer them back. I look after them.

00:27:52.039 --> 00:27:55.007
Don't you worry.

00:27:55.358 --> 00:27:59.034
They'll have to pay for it. So don't show any temper.

00:27:59.235 --> 00:28:02.615
Of course for women it is out of question.

00:28:04.223 --> 00:28:08.672
And they should be not like matrons like Mrs. Thatcher is.

00:28:08.873 --> 00:28:11.784
Alright? Like, "Why did you not clean? Do this. Do that."

00:28:11.985 --> 00:28:14.774
They are not to say that. Not even once!

00:28:14.975 --> 00:28:16.818
You better do everything yourself.

00:28:17.019 --> 00:28:19.552
Don't tell your husband, "Do this. Do that." like a servant.

00:28:19.753 --> 00:28:24.205
Don't make them into servants. It is your job to do something.

00:28:24.406 --> 00:28:28.385
It is their pleasure to help you out. It's a fact.

00:28:28.586 --> 00:28:32.736
But you will see that that once you start doing everything

00:28:32.937 --> 00:28:36.667
then, men become your slaves.

00:28:37.398 --> 00:28:38.905
And...

00:28:39.106 --> 00:28:40.187
(automatically)

00:28:40.388 --> 00:28:43.199
Automatically he says!

00:28:43.965 --> 00:28:46.681
So because we are in a very joyful mood today.

00:28:46.882 --> 00:28:48.591
So many are getting married, you know.

00:28:48.792 --> 00:28:51.564
Just before you came I was late because I was arranging marriages.

00:28:51.765 --> 00:28:55.772
We have arranged about ten marriages within this time.

00:29:01.451 --> 00:29:04.969
So now we have to be in the center.

00:29:05.253 --> 00:29:07.166
We have to be in a joyous mood.

00:29:07.367 --> 00:29:10.281
We have to enjoy our wives and our husbands.

00:29:10.482 --> 00:29:14.792
That's the only thing that is your own, is your private,

00:29:14.993 --> 00:29:16.898
which is just something great.

00:29:17.099 --> 00:29:21.175
But don't start crying, weeping about the past. Forget the past!

00:29:21.376 --> 00:29:23.426
Don't discuss it! Don't talk! No one likes it.

00:29:23.627 --> 00:29:27.632
These all romantic nonsensical ideas, throw them out!

00:29:27.833 --> 00:29:31.553
They're all nonsensical ideas. Just start it afresh

00:29:31.754 --> 00:29:34.223
with a great idea that you are going to start

00:29:34.424 --> 00:29:37.273
a new life of understanding and joy.

00:29:37.474 --> 00:29:39.861
Doesn't matter what your mother says father says, anything.

00:29:40.062 --> 00:29:43.366
That's not important for us. I'm your father, I'm your mother,

00:29:43.567 --> 00:29:46.995
I'm your sister, whatever you may call it.

00:29:47.388 --> 00:29:52.618
And I have given you a wife. So now you cannot blame me for anything.

00:29:54.295 --> 00:30:03.258
Now, let us start afresh with this new Universal Nirmala Religion.

00:30:03.459 --> 00:30:10.389
So you are all the members of the Universal Nirmala Religion, alright?

00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:13.582
All of you agree?

00:30:16.158 --> 00:30:21.190
"Bola Vishwa Dharma Nirmala Dharma ki jay"

00:30:23.142 --> 00:30:25.473
"Vishwa Nirmala Dharma" say it like this.

00:30:25.674 --> 00:30:29.960
"Vishwa Nirmala Dharma ki jay"
