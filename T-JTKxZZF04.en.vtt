07:03.600 --> 07:10.600
Today, it’s a great day that you are here
to worship your Guru in the realm of the heart

07:19.600 --> 07:26.600
of the universe. If we can do that in our
domain of the heart, we don’t have to do

07:33.450 --> 07:36.110
anything else.

07:36.110 --> 07:43.110
Today, also, I feel I have to tell you about
Sahaja Yoga and its value, which is related

08:00.930 --> 08:07.930
to other Yogas which were accepted in the
olden days all over the world. They called

08:14.860 --> 08:21.860
it, one, as the Yoga – not Sahaja Yoga,
Yoga. It started with various types of practices

08:30.200 --> 08:34.480
of ‘Ashtanga’ [Sanskrit/Hindi meaning
‘having eight stages/parts’] Yogas – eightfold

08:34.480 --> 08:41.480
yogas – with a Guru. And one had to go through
lots of hardships. Nobody who was married

08:49.190 --> 08:56.190
was allowed into that Ashtanga Yoga, and they
had to give up their families, give up their

09:00.759 --> 09:07.759
relationships. They had to become
absolutely without any attachments, to go
to a Guru. All their property, all their possessions

09:26.720 --> 09:33.720
were given up. Not to the Guru as is done
in modern times, but given away. And this

09:39.199 --> 09:42.089
was called as Yoga.

09:42.089 --> 09:49.089
The another style was called as Sankhya. Sankhya
is where all your life you have to gather

09:59.949 --> 10:06.949
things with detachment, and then to distribute
them completely and take to a Guru, in a way

10:18.240 --> 10:25.240
completely surrendered, and then get realization.
Sankhya was the left-sided behavior. And the

10:39.259 --> 10:46.259
Yoga was the right-sided. Where the Gayatri
Mantra was used was the Sankhya. Because they

10:52.199 --> 10:59.199
were left-sided, they used to use Gayatri
Mantra. They went so much to the left side

11:05.839 --> 11:12.839
- that is to gather things, to gather possessions,
to gather properties, to gather all kinds

11:14.170 --> 11:21.170
of friends and relations and societies - that
they were afraid that they may be completely

11:25.970 --> 11:32.970
lost into all those things. They would go
to Gayatri, the Mantra of Gayatri which teaches

11:39.310 --> 11:46.310
you the essences of all our Chakras – the
centers. I have told about this before also

11:50.460 --> 11:57.460
– ‘Bhu’, ‘Bhurv’, ‘Swaha’. ‘Bhu’
stands for the essence or the ‘Bija’ of

11:58.370 --> 12:05.370
the ‘Mooladhara’; ‘Bhuv’ for the universe
that is created that is Swadisthana’s ‘Bija’;

12:09.200 --> 12:16.200
‘Swaha’ is the ‘Bija’ of the Nabhi;
‘Manah’ is the essence of the Heart Chakra.

12:25.549 --> 12:32.549
Then, ‘Janah’ is the people, collectivity,
is the essence or the ‘Bija’ of the Vishuddhi

12:35.239 --> 12:42.239
Chakra. Then, ‘Tapah’ is the one where
you go into ‘tapasya’, into renunciation,

12:46.060 --> 12:53.060
into hardships – is the essence of the Agnya
Chakra. And then the ‘Satya’ is the truth,

12:58.900 --> 13:05.900
is the essence of the Sahasrara – not the
truth that we think as truth, but the truth

13:10.579 --> 13:17.579
that is expressed in our central nervous system.
So, this is discovered at the seventh stage

13:25.290 --> 13:32.290
of the Sahasrara. So the people who did Sankhya
were, sort of, not so much respected as spiritual

13:35.889 --> 13:42.889
people, because they thought these are all
involved into worldly things and worldly possessions

13:43.320 --> 13:50.320
and worldly happenings. So, they were regarded
as something secondary. Or those who were

13:56.440 --> 14:03.440
yogis of the Gurus were regarded higher, because
they had already given up everything, and

14:03.840 --> 14:10.840
they have gone to a Guru giving up all the
things that they have. But here, these Gurus

14:15.269 --> 14:22.269
had a problem within themselves because they
found that those who came to them gave up

14:23.699 --> 14:30.699
everything – no doubt – but still there
was lurking attachments. In their own ‘Ashramas’

14:30.780 --> 14:36.720
[Hindi/Sanskrit meaning hermitages] they found,
these people had their own attachments to

14:36.720 --> 14:43.660
things. Though outwardly they had given up,
but inside they had not given up. So, they

14:43.660 --> 14:50.660
were still sticking on to these ideas that,
‘Oh, its all right. But still we can have

14:52.989 --> 14:59.210
little things like that, doesn’t matter.’
Like that, there was little compromises going

14:59.210 --> 15:04.060
on. Like, as we have here nunneries and all
that. So both, in a way, were artificial.

15:04.060 --> 15:11.060
The one side, is the Sankhyas, were trying
to ascend with all the luggage they were carrying.

15:23.940 --> 15:30.940
And another were trying to descend with all
the ambitions of ascent.

15:32.519 --> 15:39.519
So, it was a very funny thing in every aspect,
in both these styles of Yoga. As you can see

15:47.740 --> 15:54.740
that now, if you go to America you’ll find,
‘Oh God, what is this America? It’s not

15:56.760 --> 16:03.760
democracy, it’s demonocracy.’ But if you
go from that in the realm of another country

16:04.860 --> 16:11.860
like Russia, you find - what is this? You
are working here under complete pressures

16:14.059 --> 16:20.990
and fears. But as soon as a Russian comes
out of that country, he can become worse than

16:20.990 --> 16:27.990
an American. So what is this? One theory works
here, another theory works there. So which

16:28.760 --> 16:35.760
is the theory that is all right? Same you
find about religion. Say, a religion, which

16:37.890 --> 16:44.540
believes in many Gods, like the Hindus, they
are also believing now into the ‘Bhoots’.

16:44.540 --> 16:51.540
And they are also following the path of possessions.
If you go to a temple, every temple has got

16:57.450 --> 17:04.450
nice arrangement for you to get possessed.
Or even a church, or a mosque – where God

17:08.830 --> 17:15.830
has to reside, you find suddenly you get attacked
and you come out absolutely puzzled about

17:17.550 --> 17:23.999
yourself, ending up into lunatic asylums.
So what sort of worshipping places are these,

17:23.999 --> 17:30.999
where you go to find God and you get the horrible
satanic forces acting on you? That’s why,

17:33.200 --> 17:40.200
in the modern times, people have become so
very confused. We do not find truth in anything

17:45.500 --> 17:52.500
– in any ideologies, any philosophies, anything
that started… say, Confusius started humanism,

17:56.100 --> 18:03.100
Socrates started another thing, Mohammad Saheb
started another thing. Like Mohammad Saheb

18:03.150 --> 18:10.150
said let us not worship God as an idol; let
us worship Him in the ‘Nirakara’, in the

18:11.540 --> 18:18.540
formless God. But you see the formless? How
they are killing each other now? I mean, after

18:20.520 --> 18:26.379
seeing the Muslim countries, you can’t believe
there could be any formless or formful God

18:26.379 --> 18:33.379
existing anywhere – all must have run away
- the way they are fighting. Then you see

18:33.580 --> 18:40.580
the Christian countries. Wherever they have
gone, they have tried to dominate other people

18:47.740 --> 18:54.740
who were not Christians, just as if they had
a right to do it because they were Christians.

19:03.660 --> 19:08.160
The Disciples of Christ, who said, “Forgive
them for they do not know what they are doing.”

19:08.160 --> 19:15.160
And I have to say the same for all the Christians,
“Forgive them for they do not know what

19:17.600 --> 19:24.499
they are doing.” And when you are shocked
at all these things, one must sit down and

19:24.499 --> 19:31.499
think what is to be done, what’s the problem
is.

19:32.640 --> 19:39.640
So, it is neither Sankhya nor Yoga; then what
is it you have to achieve? That is Sahaja

19:42.700 --> 19:49.700
Yoga. Sahaja Yog is a system in which first
you are not given a theory, but the light

19:51.720 --> 19:58.720
in your hand to see for yourself in which
both things look the same. For example, now

19:59.119 --> 20:06.119
you have got this beautiful house made for
your Mother, while your Mother doesn’t know

20:13.080 --> 20:17.770
how to get attached to even a pin. It’s
a funny situation.

20:17.770 --> 20:21.420
Everybody has to remind Me, “Mother it is
Your house.”

20:21.420 --> 20:22.619
“Oh I see.”

20:22.619 --> 20:29.619
And I have to be reminded I must thank you
all, specially the English, specially the

20:39.280 --> 20:46.280
leaders of English Sahaja yogis, for making
full effort to get this house. But then, I

20:49.610 --> 20:56.610
think why should I thank? It’s not mine,
it’s theirs – and that’s what it is.

21:03.290 --> 21:10.290
So a new type of confusion starts, and that’s
what I felt that this confusion is very sweet

21:16.939 --> 21:23.939
and beautiful. It’s a fact that nothing
belongs to us, but every thing belongs to

21:29.670 --> 21:36.450
us. When I think about how beautifully you
have done this place, it belongs to Me, all

21:36.450 --> 21:43.450
right; this house belongs to Me; England belongs
to Me and above all, the whole world belongs

22:00.270 --> 22:07.270
to Me. That’s how we see Sankhya and Yoga
become one in Sahaja Yoga. And it’s said

22:29.400 --> 22:36.400
that when you see Sankhya and Yoga as one,
then only ‘Sapashyati’ – that’s the

22:36.580 --> 22:39.840
one who sees; that’s the one is the witness.

22:39.840 --> 22:46.840
So, for normal people it could be that how
is it your Mother is supposed to be a Guru

22:54.080 --> 23:00.730
and She wears all ornaments? But what to do?
She’s also a Mother and She is also a Goddess.

23:00.730 --> 23:07.730
Another confusion. How to make these two things
be? You see a Guru has to be a very angry

23:14.679 --> 23:20.570
person, wearing only single dress either upwards
or downwards, I don’t know how, with a big

23:20.570 --> 23:27.570
thick rod in the hand, never smiling – laughing
no question – smiling. And the Gurus have

23:35.559 --> 23:42.559
to be very long faced, developing big, big
beards, and no ladies allowed. In such a situation,

23:44.109 --> 23:51.109
where the women are not to be seen at all,
I mean I shouldn’t even see My face - it’s

24:02.830 --> 24:09.830
like that. There is a big discussion in all
the scriptures - not scriptures, I would say

24:13.139 --> 24:20.139
the critiques, whether a woman should be allowed
to do the spiritual practices or not – imagine.

24:27.899 --> 24:34.899
Not only among Christians, you’ll be surprised,
even in Indian scriptures - whether is woman

24:35.070 --> 24:42.070
is allowed or not to do spiritual practices.
Now when your Mother is a woman and She is

24:46.470 --> 24:53.470
your Guru, what will you do? This is another
confusion because it is wrong, the whole thing

25:00.360 --> 25:07.360
is falsehood, based on no basis at all. You
may try anything to say that women are not

25:14.340 --> 25:21.340
meant for spiritual life, try any argument,
it fails. The other day I met one big John

25:28.580 --> 25:35.580
in a University, big fellow, I might say really
hard nut, and he started saying, “We Christians

25:40.980 --> 25:47.980
cannot accept a woman to be God.”

25:49.320 --> 25:56.019
I said, “Why?”

25:56.019 --> 25:58.860
“Because…”

25:58.860 --> 26:05.860
So to put all these upside-down stories right,
your Mother had to come on this earth as a

26:19.820 --> 26:26.820
Guru. I got to this point out of one little
confusion I had about Myself. The other day,

26:33.019 --> 26:36.340
somebody was after My life that I should buy
a bracelet. I said, “I have no money anymore;

26:36.340 --> 26:36.590
I don’t want to buy.”

26:36.409 --> 26:38.220
“All right we will give it in Puja.”

26:38.220 --> 26:41.860
I said, “But now there is only Guru Puja.”

26:41.860 --> 26:44.240
Said, “All right, we will give it in Guru
Puja.”

26:44.240 --> 26:51.100
I said, “To buy a bracelet in Guru Puja
is something funny I have done.”

26:51.100 --> 26:58.100
After all, in a Guru Puja you don’t give
a bracelet to your Guru, do you? You can give,

26:59.029 --> 27:06.029
say, a big rod; or you might give him a sandalwood
‘Khada’ - what is it called - ‘Chappals’,

27:10.230 --> 27:17.230
or you may give him a shawl. But here it is…
I have asked… all right give it in Guru

27:18.380 --> 27:25.380
Puja. What was the reason? And I became aware
of My own confusion and I thought of it. I

27:30.130 --> 27:37.130
said, “This is what it is, that it has to
happen this way that, on a Guru Puja you have

27:38.110 --> 27:45.110
to give a bracelet to your Guru.” Let us
change it over. The whole thing has to be

27:47.930 --> 27:54.930
brought up this way that everything faces
reality. All these false ideas have to be

27:59.050 --> 28:06.050
given up. Like, if you have a carpet upside-down,
the whole design is upside-down. But, if you

28:06.680 --> 28:13.680
put the carpet right, everything falls in
line. And that’s why you needed a Mother

28:14.960 --> 28:21.960
to give you realization, and a Guru as a Mother
to teach you that for ascent of God nobody

28:25.500 --> 28:30.810
can be prohibited.

28:30.810 --> 28:37.810
That is how the Sahaja Yoga today is working
out. In all directions, if you find, to put

28:37.850 --> 28:44.850
all upside-down things into right direction,
to expose it to reality, to bring all real

28:49.139 --> 28:56.139
values, to abolish all rotten value systems,
all political, economic systems, all spiritual

29:08.880 --> 29:15.880
theologies, all psychological and all such
nonsensical ideas into its proper direction.

29:23.019 --> 29:30.019
How in one incarnation it has worked out,
you can imagine. How in one incarnation all

29:38.340 --> 29:42.649
these ideas have been put right.

29:42.649 --> 29:49.649
Another idea exists, among Hindus, that if
you are a religious people, you should be

29:50.230 --> 29:57.230
a vegetarian. All the Brahmins believe this,
and even the non-Brahmins. But we had a Brahmin

29:58.659 --> 30:05.340
working in one of the places where I was living,
and they said that for Mother we have to give

30:05.340 --> 30:12.340
meat, She doesn’t eat anything else. She
has to eat proteins. She said, “Yes,yes,

30:13.540 --> 30:17.960
Of course. For a Mother, She must have.”
Whether it’s a Brahmin or a non-Brahmin,

30:17.960 --> 30:24.960
all understand that Mother has to eat proteins.
Because She has to drink the blood of all

30:25.159 --> 30:28.880
these ‘rakshasas’ [Hindi meaning demons],
how can She be vegetarian? And if She has

30:28.880 --> 30:35.880
to kill so many devils, how can She be non-violent?
So the contrast that you see in the description

30:47.560 --> 30:54.560
of the Mother - that She is the one who is
the most furious personality when it comes

30:57.399 --> 31:04.399
to the killing of the people who are of the
negative land, who are trying to destroy Her

31:06.290 --> 31:13.290
creation, Her own children; and She is the
sweetest and the mildest person for Her own

31:14.310 --> 31:21.310
children. These two contrasts should be seen.
Even in animals you’ll find the same contrast,

31:21.540 --> 31:28.540
but very evident in an incarnation like this.
And today, through Sahaja Yoga, we have been

31:30.750 --> 31:36.529
able to prove that Sankhya and Yoga are the
same.

31:36.529 --> 31:43.180
Whether you collect things, whether you have
possessions or whether you give away, makes

31:43.180 --> 31:50.180
no difference to a person who is detached
from within. If you collect them for others,

31:54.830 --> 32:01.830
even better. But if you collect for yourself
and then give away, that’s even much better.

32:03.690 --> 32:08.080
Because first you collect for yourself then
you think, “Oh it’s good for me, I will

32:08.080 --> 32:15.029
use this one for myself, will be a good idea”
- so the self is there - but then, that you

32:15.029 --> 32:19.420
give away. That means your detachment is complete.
Or the third personality could be liking [not

32:19.420 --> 32:26.420
clear]… which just goes on collecting and
just goes on giving. Without thinking it collects

32:28.600 --> 32:35.389
and without thinking it gives because thinking
is not My job. That is one thing I have given

32:35.389 --> 32:42.389
up – is to think. I don’t want to think
– that’s your work, not Me. And without

32:43.779 --> 32:50.779
thinking, how many things we have achieved
through Sahaja Yoga. Yoga and Sankhya both

32:51.870 --> 32:58.870
are products of thinking, not products of
spontaneity. This house itself is a product

33:02.889 --> 33:09.240
of spontaneity. I mean, as we call the English
as ‘Saablogs’, you see. So I took some

33:09.240 --> 33:14.460
‘Saablogs’ with Me around to see some
houses and they wanted to (see) some houses

33:14.460 --> 33:21.100
with some character – means something must
fall out, something must be crooked, this

33:21.100 --> 33:28.100
should not be straightforward. I said, “Now
please, I can’t bear all this crookedness.”

33:28.480 --> 33:31.480
So, “No, no, but it has character.”

33:31.480 --> 33:36.940
I said, “Now, this kind of a crooked nose
I don’t want.” Straightforward it should

33:36.940 --> 33:43.940
be. So they were rather disappointed at Me.
And the ‘Saablog’ had some other ideas

33:45.540 --> 33:52.269
also that, say for example, if you go to,
say, to a place called Windmere, it’s a

33:52.269 --> 33:59.269
posh place; if you go to the Northside, little
less; then if you go to the east, it’s useless

34:02.780 --> 34:09.780
– like that. I said, “Let’s go the north,
northest as far as we can go.” Because,

34:11.159 --> 34:18.159
you know, the Godess has to be ‘Dakshinamurthy’.
She has to be on the north side to be on the

34:18.810 --> 34:25.540
- Her eyes on the south. That’s the reason
She has to be… I mean we could not have

34:25.540 --> 34:30.269
been in Scotland – that would have been
too much for you. But that would have been

34:30.269 --> 34:37.269
the ideal for all of us because then our ‘Drishti’
is towards - our vision is towards the south

34:38.940 --> 34:45.940
and we see the whole universe under our own
beautiful visions. So that’s how, spontaneously,

34:51.409 --> 34:58.409
we found this place. And ‘Saablog’ were,
“Yes, No, No, Yes.” But spontaneously

34:59.889 --> 35:06.889
we got it. And then we found out it has a
history; then we found out its beautiful vibrations;

35:10.759 --> 35:17.759
then we found out the potential about it.
Whatever you get spontaneously, it is full

35:18.360 --> 35:20.220
of potentials.

35:20.220 --> 35:27.220
On this point, I have to say a few words,
is important. I had to get - few points I

35:30.870 --> 35:37.870
have to say about spontaneity part which is
quite interesting – the way people think

35:43.820 --> 35:50.820
spontaneity works. Like, it’s mostly ego
part which says, ‘This is spontaneous,’

35:54.060 --> 36:01.060
with so many people. Specially the very old
Sahaja Yogis think they are authorities on

36:05.730 --> 36:12.210
spontaneity. Like, we had a land in Vaitarna.
So one of the older ones went there and he

36:12.210 --> 36:19.210
said, “This land is vibrating and this is
not vibrating.” So everybody accepted, ‘All

36:19.749 --> 36:26.529
right, all right, all right.’ Then they
said, “In this part of the land nobody should

36:26.529 --> 36:33.529
eat their food.” Now, from where does this
knowledge come? Eating food is not a sin,

36:35.759 --> 36:42.759
is it? As if it is a sin that you are eating
food in there. Then religiously they follow

36:44.769 --> 36:51.769
a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, z and again a, b,
c, d of Sahaja Yoga to such an extent, ‘ki’

36:54.110 --> 36:59.769
[Hindi meaning ‘that’] I start thinking
now they have become another fanatic Sahaja

36:59.769 --> 37:06.769
Yogis. Fanaticism is against Sahaja Yoga – absolutely.
Now they will ask, “How many times we should

37:07.129 --> 37:14.129
say this ‘Mantra’?” Then I say, “Zero
times.”

37:17.830 --> 37:24.830
“How many drops we should put, the ghee,
in our nose?” Then I say, “A full jug.”

37:37.580 --> 37:44.580
Then, “Oh, I should not have gone from the
left side, I should have gone from the right

37:48.749 --> 37:49.440
side.”

37:49.440 --> 37:53.499
Then, I would say, “You just jump up.”

37:53.499 --> 38:00.499
You have to be like children. But the ideas
are so settled down in Sahaja Yoga, now it’s

38:01.720 --> 38:08.720
so many years of course, but they should not
settle down. If they settle down, it’s not

38:08.930 --> 38:15.930
Sahaja; it’s not spontaneous. ‘If you
do this way, then it is wrong; that way, it’s

38:17.259 --> 38:24.259
wrong’ – nothing of the kind. Nothing
is wrong for you people. If you do anything

38:25.170 --> 38:30.009
wrong, your vibrations will be lost, finished.
What is there to be so cautious? Like, somebody

38:30.009 --> 38:32.920
said, “I don’t want to look at the cigarette.”
I said, “Why?”

38:32.920 --> 38:34.440
“Looking at it also is sinful.”

38:34.440 --> 38:36.740
I said, “Looking at it what happens?”

38:36.740 --> 38:39.060
“Then I feel like smoking.”

38:39.060 --> 38:43.149
So I said, “Better smoke once for all.”

38:43.149 --> 38:50.149
Or, “I cannot hold a wine bottle in my hand.”

38:52.560 --> 38:53.499
“Why?”

38:53.499 --> 38:57.970
“No, holding the wine bottle is sinful.”

38:57.970 --> 39:04.970
I mean, you can swim in the wine. So this
kind of understanding should be there. Though

39:18.159 --> 39:21.720
I have always said that if I say one thing,
you will clinch on to it. So I always say

39:21.720 --> 39:28.290
the other side of it - that don’t stick
on to something; Sahaja Yoga is not for sticking

39:28.290 --> 39:33.590
on to something. Like somebody who had learnt
certain say, lessons about Sahaja Yoga in

39:33.590 --> 39:40.590
the beginning of it, certain Mantras they
had learnt, and still they are sticking on

39:40.830 --> 39:47.540
to the same step. No, no, no, no – you have
to go ahead. This is just a staircase. Don’t

39:47.540 --> 39:54.540
get stuck at a point. We have had so many
such cases here. People get really outworn

39:58.070 --> 40:05.070
as they say. They will go on telling you so
many nonsensical ideas – “You see, if

40:05.210 --> 40:11.970
you do like this, then this happens.” First
of all, you don’t give ideas to others.

40:11.970 --> 40:14.430
That’s one thing - if you decide that we
don’t give ideas about what’s wrong with

40:14.430 --> 40:16.670
another person, half of your job is done.
Because you don’t have to do any job, as

40:16.670 --> 40:23.670
I don’t do. Anybody who comes, “You are
a ‘bhoot’.” You better have it. I get

40:26.420 --> 40:33.420
reports from others. They say that your Sahaja
Yogis are wicked people. I said, “Why?”

40:33.730 --> 40:39.159
“Oh, they tell you, ‘You are evil.’
They tell you, ‘You are possessed’, they

40:39.159 --> 40:45.909
tell you, ‘You are this, you are that’;
they are very wicked people.”

40:45.909 --> 40:52.909
I am really shocked to hear that Sahaja Yogis
- how can they be wicked? If somebody is suffering

40:55.300 --> 40:58.350
from something, in the phone they say, “Oh
you better have it. It’s good for you.”

40:58.350 --> 41:05.350
That’s not the way. We have to be not only
humble, very tactful and sweet to new people

41:09.580 --> 41:15.130
– if you want any more to come in. But if
you have decided not to have anymore, because

41:15.130 --> 41:20.979
you will have to put another marquee, then
I have nothing to say. But if you want others

41:20.979 --> 41:27.979
to come in, then it’s important that you
talk to them in a very sweet and beautiful

41:28.830 --> 41:35.830
language, the way they understand. Rudeness,
arrogance, showing off, is of no use. One

41:36.140 --> 41:43.140
should understand Sahaja Yoga is where you
are in complete enjoyment about it; you are

41:46.050 --> 41:50.660
just lost into that enjoyment. Where is the
time to remember how many times to give a

41:50.660 --> 41:57.660
‘Bandhan’ to yourself? What is the need
to give ‘Bandhan’ to yourself? It’s

41:59.449 --> 42:06.449
all a joke now for you, should be. A little
child sucks the milk from the bottle, all

42:08.620 --> 42:15.620
right, because it has no teeth. But what about
you people having that kind of a thing? It’s

42:20.340 --> 42:27.340
very childish and shows no growth at all.
Sahaja Yoga must grow within. You should not

42:33.140 --> 42:40.140
be, anymore, regarded as immature Sahaja Yogis.
I would say: a person who is a matured Sahaja

42:44.800 --> 42:51.670
Yogi is the one who can combine so many things
together, with all beautiful lines, thin lines,

42:51.670 --> 42:54.520
thin ‘Maryadas’ [Hindi/Sanskrit meaning
code of conduct] maintained. But, you cannot

42:54.520 --> 42:56.500
do the other way round.

42:56.500 --> 43:03.500
For example, you shouldn’t say, “All right,
now I will be sweet. Then I will be angry;

43:05.170 --> 43:12.170
then I will be sweet; then I’ll be like
this; then I’ll be like that.” It will

43:14.830 --> 43:21.830
be a hotchpotch. It is a funny personality
you see - suddenly I get angry, like that

43:30.100 --> 43:37.100
[facial expression?], and then I [presumably
Mother demonstrates with facial expression].

43:42.699 --> 43:46.380
People will think you are doing ‘Bharatnatyam’
[a form of Indian classical dance] or something

43:46.380 --> 43:49.120
like that. Showing all your moods – in five
minutes you show ten moods. This is the growth

43:49.120 --> 43:56.120
within you, which will show. So, we have to
have our growth, and for growth, let us be

43:57.650 --> 44:04.650
silent within. Let us not react to others
- “This person is like that, that person

44:05.209 --> 44:12.209
is like that.” What about yourself? Also
there… other ways. Like, I tell somebody

44:14.890 --> 44:20.939
that, you see, you have this problem. So that
person immediately goes to the second person

44:20.939 --> 44:24.469
and says, “You see, Mother told me that
you too have this problem, better look after

44:24.469 --> 44:29.320
it.” I didn’t tell that person; I told
you. Keep it to yourself. So, ‘Mother says’

44:29.320 --> 44:36.320
is to be given up, absolutely. If Mother has
to say, She’ll say it. Why should you communicate;

44:38.070 --> 44:43.330
why should you say? I never asked you to say
that.

44:43.330 --> 44:50.330
Understanding Sahaja Yoga is very simple,
extremely simple, when you understand one

44:58.490 --> 45:05.490
thing - that you have to have your innocence
intact. Now, “How to get to innocence?”

45:08.910 --> 45:15.910
people will say. How to get to innocence?
It’s a vicious circle. How to get to innocence?

45:16.050 --> 45:19.040
– It’s a very vicious circle. We have
to get to innocence, through what? Your ego

45:19.040 --> 45:23.250
or superego? How will you get to innocence?
Mother says, “Don’t raise your Kundalini.”

45:23.250 --> 45:28.120
I mean, I am sitting here - people are just
doing like that. What’s happening? I am

45:28.120 --> 45:35.120
sitting here - your Kundalini is up there
on your head. What are you raising? Now how

45:37.900 --> 45:44.900
to manage is the problem. Very simple it is.
In the beginning I said, “Let your Guru

45:50.870 --> 45:57.870
reside in your heart.” How to manage – why?
Let Mother manage. Mother is managing me.

46:01.140 --> 46:08.140
Keep it at that. Your right side will clear.
Your left side will clear when you say, “Nobody

46:17.310 --> 46:23.250
can manage me but Mother can manage me”
- two things together. Things will work out.

46:23.250 --> 46:28.429
Thank God you have somebody like Me, who is
sitting here, who can say so. Think of those

46:28.429 --> 46:33.760
who never had anyone to tell them, or to be
in their presence to say that I can manage

46:33.760 --> 46:40.760
this, or you can manage that. That now you
can balance. Allow your Kundalini to grow.

46:46.020 --> 46:53.020
Everything works out. Like this house when
I purchased, or when they purchased, or who

46:56.610 --> 47:03.610
purchased - So many questions and complications
– How, how, how? But it’s worked; it’s

47:04.510 --> 47:11.510
there, quite intact; nothing has fallen off;
nothing has gone wrong. I had to shout once,

47:13.189 --> 47:20.189
all right. But let Me shout, you don’t start
shouting. As soon as I finish, they will take

47:27.400 --> 47:34.400
a loudspeaker, shout even louder. “Mother
said so, you are this, that.” I am saying

47:35.250 --> 47:42.250
about you, (to) whom are you preaching? But
only, you must know that when I tell you something,

47:43.419 --> 47:50.419
please do it; please do it. See because I
know quite a lot. Because I am Guru, your

47:52.840 --> 47:59.840
Guru; because I am the Guru of all the Gurus.
And those who is a real Guru, knows that my

48:01.929 --> 48:08.929
Mother knows everything. She is knowledge
Herself. If She says something, it means something.

48:14.949 --> 48:21.949
And even I may test you sometimes, doesn’t
matter. That’s how you become the Guru.

48:25.419 --> 48:32.419
Shivaji had a Guru called Ramadasa. In those
days, Gurus used to take lot of test of their

48:37.709 --> 48:43.290
disciples. I never took your test or anything.
But you are testing yourself, that’s all.

48:43.290 --> 48:50.290
And his Guru one day said that, “I think
I need the milk of a tigress. I have to drink

48:50.400 --> 48:57.400
the milk of a tigress.” Half of them died
and most of them didn’t hear it. Shivaji

49:02.120 --> 49:09.120
said, “All right. I’ll get you.” He
went in the jungles. He saw a tigress and

49:14.860 --> 49:21.860
there were little little, small little children
she had, and those cubs were lying on the

49:25.890 --> 49:32.890
side. He went and he just said ‘Namaskar’
[Hindi word meaning salutation] to her. (He)

49:33.510 --> 49:39.780
Said, “My Guru wants your milk,” that’s
all – because Gurus are ‘Parabrahma’

49:39.780 --> 49:43.939
[Hindi/Sanskrit meaning God Almighty], their
orders are listened to by the ‘Parabrahma’.

49:43.939 --> 49:50.939
“My Guru, Shri Ramadasa, wants your milk.
So please, will you give me your milk?”

49:53.060 --> 50:00.060
So nicely she got up, stood up before him.
He milked her and took that milk for his Guru.

50:07.179 --> 50:14.179
This is what it is. Have you understood the
meaning of ‘Gurupada’ [Hindi/Sanskrit

50:14.830 --> 50:18.340
meaning the status/position of Guru]?

50:18.340 --> 50:25.340
When you become absolutely one with the desires
of your Guru, you achieve the position of

50:28.340 --> 50:35.340
a Guru. But if you still have certain ideas
about it, then Shri Ramadasa has said that

50:40.429 --> 50:44.900
then God ‘Alpadhrishtapaye … [not clear]’
sees your little courage [?] - “All right,

50:44.900 --> 50:51.900
go ahead. Break your heads and then come back.
I’ll fix them up.” So it is important

50:53.260 --> 51:00.260
that we should do one thing seriously – is
to take your Mother very seriously when it

51:03.790 --> 51:05.070
comes to some request.

51:05.070 --> 51:10.500
Of course, in English language I always say,
“Please, will you do it?” Or I may even

51:10.500 --> 51:16.570
say, “I am afraid will you do it?” But
that should make no difference. Other day

51:16.570 --> 51:21.500
only, when we were coming for Cardiff, I said
that the first class will be coming on the

51:21.500 --> 51:25.910
other side. But everybody at the platform
said, “No, it is coming on the other side.”

51:25.910 --> 51:31.760
I said, “All right.” We sat down, and
then they announced that the first class is

51:31.760 --> 51:38.130
coming on this side. So we all again walked
back. It’s all right for those people, but

51:38.130 --> 51:45.130
what about you? Many a times you have seen.
And at the asking of a Guru, if something

51:46.330 --> 51:53.330
goes wrong also, it should be always accepted
as the law of the Divine - because, Guru is

51:54.840 --> 52:01.840
the giver of the law of the Divine, not the
worldly laws. The law of the Divine He gives

52:03.040 --> 52:07.740
you. The law of the Divine you understand,
then you have to surrender to that law of

52:07.740 --> 52:14.740
the Divine, and that’s how you will become
masters of that law.

52:17.630 --> 52:21.620
Today, for a Guru Puja, I can go on talking
to you. But today, I would request you to

52:21.620 --> 52:28.620
understand that whilst surrendering, as Islam
is called, was so important -
that if God is your Guru, let Him guide you;

52:46.660 --> 52:53.660
Thy will be done. Let us not guide ourselves
and also, sometimes they try to guide the

53:00.030 --> 53:07.030
Guru as well. Then the Guru plays tricks,
and then you fall into the trap of tricks,

53:07.530 --> 53:11.939
and then you find it’s too much.

53:11.939 --> 53:18.939
It is better to listen to what the Guru is
telling you, and better to do it. Whatever

53:21.900 --> 53:28.900
the Guru says is all right. Gurus can ask
you anything. I mean, I am quite a nice Guru.

53:31.110 --> 53:38.110
Like, this Ramadasa himself asked his disciples
that, “I have got a very bad, septic, big

53:43.709 --> 53:50.709
boil and please try to suck it out because
it is full of pus.” Imagine. So they didn’t

53:56.219 --> 54:02.699
know what to do, you know. How to suck the
pus of the Guru is too much. But Shivaji came

54:02.699 --> 54:08.330
forward. He took down his hat, sat down next
to him, started sucking. People said, “How

54:08.330 --> 54:15.330
is it?” Said, “It’s very sweet, very
nice.” Actually, he had tied a mango there.

54:19.630 --> 54:26.630
That is how the Gurus took lot of tests. I
have never taken your test, and you do not

54:43.790 --> 54:48.800
take the tests of others. Leave them to Me,
I’ll manage all of them one by one. Whatever

54:48.800 --> 54:55.800
has to happen happens. In Sahaja Yoga, to
think that 100% will be rich, healthy, wealthy

54:57.659 --> 55:04.659
and on top of the world, is a nonsense. If
we become very wealthy, then there will be

55:09.760 --> 55:16.760
recession because others will be very poor.
If we become very healthy then nobody will

55:20.500 --> 55:27.500
come near us; if we all look like wrestlers,
who will come near us? If we become very wise,

55:30.179 --> 55:36.400
then people will be frightened of such wise
people; nothing will… they cannot understand

55:36.400 --> 55:43.400
anything, it will go over their heads. So
let us be in the center. We should be wealthy,

55:43.810 --> 55:50.810
but not too much; we should be healthy, but
not too much; we should be wise, but not too

55:52.320 --> 55:59.320
much. So far, so good – that’s how we
should move.

55:59.459 --> 56:06.240
So we keep to our ‘Maryadas’ and we become
beautiful Sahaja Yogis, who will be congenial

56:06.240 --> 56:13.240
to others, who will be able to get others
to us, who will be able to project an image

56:18.350 --> 56:25.350
of magnetic personalities. And this is what
we have to do. If we try to show off in any

56:28.040 --> 56:34.000
way - like I have seen people try to show
off unnecessarily – there is no need. Just

56:34.000 --> 56:41.000
be in the background. If you are very much
in the background, just be in the foreground.

56:45.230 --> 56:52.230
Try to balance yourself. Try to watch yourself
and guide yourself and tell yourself, “Become

56:53.590 --> 57:00.590
your own Gurus.” Judge yourself how far
you are in the center, how far you are growing,

57:01.669 --> 57:08.159
how much growth have you achieved. Are you
still attached to small things here and there?

57:08.159 --> 57:15.159
Are you still bothered about small things?
– “Mother, I should have got 80% marks,

57:16.380 --> 57:23.380
I have got only 75% marks.” Oh God. Because
he got 75% marks, there is something good

57:25.290 --> 57:32.030
has to come out. He has to learn a lesson,
maybe. Or maybe that he has to take some other

57:32.030 --> 57:39.030
course. Maybe something that is good for his
ascent has to work out – is to be seen if

57:39.500 --> 57:46.500
you have to be Gurus. If you can’t see that,
how can others see that? This is to be realized.

57:48.659 --> 57:55.659
Not to be put in the mind, but to be realized
in the heart. In the realm of your heart you

58:01.600 --> 58:08.600
have to realize it; you have to understand
it in the realm of your heart. Nice that we

58:11.140 --> 58:18.140
are in England, the heart of the universe,
that we are talking about opening our hearts.

58:22.659 --> 58:29.659
If you have to put Me there, is the ocean
of love, and to contain this ocean of love,

58:29.689 --> 58:36.689
you have to have a very, very large heart
– bigger than your personalities, bigger

59:08.949 --> 59:15.949
than your countries, bigger than this world,
bigger than this universe.

59:51.560 --> 59:58.560
May God bless you.

01:00:07.050 --> 01:00:14.050
End of transcript.
