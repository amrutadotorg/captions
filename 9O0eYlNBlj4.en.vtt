01:04.016 --> 01:07.226
﻿Today is the eighth day

01:07.426 --> 01:09.620
of the Devi puja,

01:10.133 --> 01:13.339
and on this day,

01:13.539 --> 01:15.580
the power of

01:15.867 --> 01:17.460
Kali acts

01:18.583 --> 01:20.620
and She is the one

01:20.820 --> 01:22.701
called as Samhara Kali,

01:22.949 --> 01:25.157
meaning the one who

01:25.876 --> 01:28.747
destroys all the evil forces.

01:28.947 --> 01:31.651
So it is a very good day,

01:31.852 --> 01:34.823
that we have a puja here, in England.

01:35.024 --> 01:37.032
I am very happy about it.

01:37.805 --> 01:39.420
My spectacles?

01:40.543 --> 01:43.460
In my purse, I think so.

01:44.371 --> 01:46.440
Where is she? She’s got it?

01:49.805 --> 01:51.220
Now,

01:54.350 --> 01:56.635
I was thinking that I should

01:56.835 --> 02:00.780
talk to the UK Sahaja Yogis, because very important.

02:02.338 --> 02:05.203
I’ll be completing now sixteen years

02:05.403 --> 02:07.030
of my stay in UK

02:07.254 --> 02:10.818
and I have really found such love and such

02:11.019 --> 02:13.100
goodness about you people.

02:15.356 --> 02:17.867
Now next year, I will not be

02:18.067 --> 02:21.900
staying here because my husband is going to be transferred

02:22.891 --> 02:26.740
and of course and I’ll be coming back

02:27.207 --> 02:29.978
and for a month or so, I could be with you,

02:30.179 --> 02:32.980
maybe much more closer than

02:33.180 --> 02:35.300
I have been so far.

02:36.048 --> 02:38.098
But there’s something that

02:38.298 --> 02:41.620
I think I should warn you people, because now

02:41.820 --> 02:44.565
I’m receiving lots of letters about Gavin asking,

02:44.765 --> 02:48.060
“Why Gavin has become like that? What’s gone wrong with him?”

02:48.260 --> 02:51.502
Perhaps everybody seems to quite frightened to see

02:52.252 --> 02:56.180
these things happening and to some other Sahaj Yogis also.

02:56.818 --> 02:59.139
Because in other countries, when the

02:59.340 --> 03:01.740
Sahaj Yogis go out of Sahaja Yoga,

03:01.940 --> 03:04.056
they don’t get after me, or they don’t get after

03:04.256 --> 03:06.218
Sahaja Yoga or Sahaj Yogis.

03:06.418 --> 03:10.340
But they think there’s something wrong
with them and they feel very sorry and keep out.

03:10.678 --> 03:14.283
But why is it that Gavin has become so adamant and

03:14.484 --> 03:17.127
is becoming so much against us?

03:17.327 --> 03:19.450
And I am told he’s supplying

03:19.651 --> 03:23.651
information to some horrible organisations and things like that.

03:25.002 --> 03:26.923
I mean I don’t know how to explain human

03:27.123 --> 03:29.443
behaviour. It’s difficult because

03:29.643 --> 03:33.580
when you have found out
something so great and if you cannot value it,

03:33.780 --> 03:36.200
what happens? Why?

03:37.737 --> 03:41.220
So, I feel that

03:42.234 --> 03:45.238
English have so many great qualities among them

03:45.446 --> 03:47.267
because at the time of crisis

03:47.467 --> 03:49.588
they are the ones who have always stood up.

03:49.820 --> 03:51.992
Because of them we could avert the war,

03:52.192 --> 03:55.380
second world war, was averted because of them.

03:55.690 --> 03:58.327
Not only that, but also

03:58.968 --> 04:01.228
they work out things at the

04:01.429 --> 04:03.129
nick of the time,

04:03.330 --> 04:07.330
whenever it is necessary. And

04:08.569 --> 04:12.060
their whole style is

04:14.300 --> 04:16.042
very quiet

04:16.242 --> 04:19.780
and they show results at the right time,

04:19.980 --> 04:22.825
that’s a fact, no doubt. One has to accept it.

04:23.026 --> 04:25.364
All these qualities are there, but I think there are

04:25.564 --> 04:27.826
certain other things which have crawled up and

04:28.026 --> 04:30.641
maybe that’s one of the reasons we have to guard against,

04:30.841 --> 04:32.261
if you have to keep to Sahaja Yoga,

04:32.461 --> 04:34.098
if you have to grow in Sahaja Yog.

04:36.142 --> 04:39.252
So one of the things I have found out that

04:39.534 --> 04:42.540
English believe more in the style,

04:43.193 --> 04:45.401
what your style is.

04:47.758 --> 04:51.064
Say, like a cocktail style,

04:51.264 --> 04:53.701
you can call it, or a dandy style

04:53.901 --> 04:57.754
then a punk style and this style and that style.

04:57.955 --> 04:59.740
You have got tailcoat style.

04:59.940 --> 05:02.900
All sorts of styles here, they say.

05:03.243 --> 05:07.265
And because too much of it, in the atmosphere, too much.

05:07.466 --> 05:09.399
As soon as you see a house they’ll tell you,

05:09.599 --> 05:12.535
“Oh, this is Georgian!”

05:12.735 --> 05:14.174
“This is

05:15.189 --> 05:18.742
such and such,” and “This is Neo this and that!”

05:18.942 --> 05:21.727
So, you see, it must go up to that style,

05:21.927 --> 05:23.860
it has to be that style.

05:24.461 --> 05:27.947
And any house

05:28.147 --> 05:30.261
which is not to that style,

05:30.461 --> 05:32.790
then they’ll say, “Oh, it’s a compromise!”

05:32.990 --> 05:34.712
It's a little,

05:35.657 --> 05:37.487
it's a little fussy or I don’t know

05:37.687 --> 05:40.180
what all words they use to criticise such a thing.

05:40.740 --> 05:43.853
So this is one thing we have to know that styles

05:44.053 --> 05:46.500
cannot substitute the content.

05:48.004 --> 05:49.740
It cannot be a substitute.

05:49.964 --> 05:51.486
Style is so outward

05:51.687 --> 05:53.545
and so,

05:54.185 --> 05:55.778
so deceptive.

05:55.979 --> 05:58.636
It is so deceptive and so outward

05:58.837 --> 06:01.900
that it deceives us also.

06:02.201 --> 06:04.250
It deceives us also.

06:06.136 --> 06:09.184
Like, if we feel that we are a class,

06:09.384 --> 06:12.620
or something, there’s class consciousness also quite a lot.

06:12.860 --> 06:15.203
If we start thinking, we are class.

06:15.403 --> 06:18.138
Then I mean, one has to know that

06:18.338 --> 06:20.470
this is something very man made stuff

06:20.670 --> 06:22.340
— to be a class.

06:22.540 --> 06:25.255
If you say, “I am a class.” That means it’s all man made.

06:25.455 --> 06:27.907
It’s not the way the Divine is.

06:28.107 --> 06:30.805
Divine doesn’t have all these

06:31.005 --> 06:32.540
differentiations.

06:32.740 --> 06:36.740
You are a class Sahaja Yogi, means in your content,

06:37.423 --> 06:40.660
within yourself, you have such powers;

06:41.813 --> 06:45.500
that you can face yourself happily and you enjoy yourself,

06:45.707 --> 06:47.413
and you know yourself.

06:48.154 --> 06:50.780
That is what is a class in Sahaj Yoga,

06:51.255 --> 06:54.220
not how you dress up or how you talk

06:54.420 --> 06:58.380
of you hold your fork and spoon — it’s not the way.

06:58.839 --> 07:00.380
So this style

07:00.580 --> 07:04.220
that we think of is no substitute for the contents.

07:05.023 --> 07:08.046
Now this thing works out better with this

07:08.246 --> 07:10.540
outside culture that we have,

07:11.233 --> 07:13.566
that you should not express your feelings.

07:13.766 --> 07:16.300
This is another nonsense they have taught us,

07:16.500 --> 07:19.940
in this country, which is all nonsense, absolute nonsense

07:20.140 --> 07:22.467
— you should not express your feelings and

07:22.667 --> 07:25.605
you should be poised.

07:26.779 --> 07:28.226
And

07:28.427 --> 07:29.979
say somebody's dead,

07:30.180 --> 07:33.883
somebody died, in our friend, I mean in our circle,

07:34.084 --> 07:36.588
and Mr. Shrivastava went there. Thank God,

07:36.788 --> 07:40.062
I had no black sari so I didn’t go! But you must go in the black sari,

07:40.262 --> 07:41.940
and black blouse

07:42.140 --> 07:45.105
and black everything and the black bangles and I said,

07:45.305 --> 07:49.300
“Baba, I don’t have all these black,
black things, so what to do?” So I didn’t go.

07:49.741 --> 07:52.140
I mean what is there? A person is dead now,

07:52.340 --> 07:55.780
he doesn’t see you whether you’re in black or red, you see?

07:59.411 --> 08:01.700
But one thing is there, definitely,

08:01.900 --> 08:04.398
that if you wear something, you see.

08:04.598 --> 08:06.885
Whatever you wear, you express the inside,

08:07.085 --> 08:10.540
the content within you, that you’re so sad and unhappy.

08:10.740 --> 08:12.844
And then he went and

08:13.044 --> 08:15.140
there was a champagne for that!

08:15.340 --> 08:17.875
I mean, somebody is born you have a champagne

08:18.075 --> 08:21.117
somebody dies you have a champagne, I mean anyway.

08:21.318 --> 08:23.685
So champagne has nothing to do with the style,

08:23.885 --> 08:25.687
they can have at any time.

08:25.888 --> 08:29.900
But the style was, you must wear black, everything black.

08:30.774 --> 08:32.660
I said, “This is too much!” I mean

08:32.860 --> 08:36.860
at the most one could have some strip of black to suggest.

08:37.060 --> 08:39.540
But what is there to suggest, if somebody is dead?

08:39.740 --> 08:42.878
I mean you do feel inside. And he was looking very sick,

08:43.078 --> 08:45.226
my husband was looking very sick, because

08:45.426 --> 08:48.977
he was feeling so sad really that he had lost a friend.

08:49.177 --> 08:50.677
I also cried.

08:51.210 --> 08:53.541
So they said, “What’s the matter, are you not well?”

08:53.741 --> 08:56.318
They were all laughing, joking,

08:56.518 --> 08:59.418
and the dead body was lying in the next room!

09:01.308 --> 09:03.553
So C.P. said, “No, but such a friend!”

09:03.753 --> 09:07.296
“Oh! Be poised! You have no poise, Mr Srivastava!”

09:07.744 --> 09:09.798
And one lady had gone, whom

09:09.999 --> 09:11.756
she’s also our common friend,

09:11.956 --> 09:14.060
she’s from, I think, Ghana or some place,

09:14.260 --> 09:16.420
and she started crying, you know,

09:16.748 --> 09:20.249
naturally. I would have also have also cried, thank God I didn’t go.

09:20.450 --> 09:22.340
So they all criticised her,

09:23.328 --> 09:27.020
“This is not proper, she should not
have done all this things,” and all that.

09:28.600 --> 09:30.178
So all these ideas, you see,

09:30.378 --> 09:32.831
every country has some sort of a conditioning

09:33.031 --> 09:35.940
and we must realise what our conditionings are.

09:36.180 --> 09:40.114
Then we are all right. Because we have to
break all our conditionings in every country.

09:40.315 --> 09:43.867
The best thing about Sahaja Yogis
is that once they become a Sahaja Yogi,

09:44.067 --> 09:46.295
they see the problems of their own country.

09:46.495 --> 09:48.580
This is the best thing we have.

09:48.780 --> 09:50.740
And they laugh at the people who are there.

09:50.941 --> 09:54.526
But still we must know there might
be some subtle things lying within us,

09:54.726 --> 09:57.940
because from this case of Gavin, now you can see clearly.

09:58.454 --> 10:01.220
You see, he had a style, always he had a style for everything:

10:01.421 --> 10:02.923
for puja he’ll have a style,

10:03.123 --> 10:05.946
this thing he’ll have a style, that thing he’ll have style.

10:06.146 --> 10:08.751
So I used to little bit doubt him. I said,

10:08.951 --> 10:11.701
“Why is he’s so much worried about his style?”

10:12.418 --> 10:15.075
For small, small things. Even if he’ll wear

10:15.276 --> 10:17.645
an Indian dress, he will think of a style,

10:17.845 --> 10:20.906
what style it is. I said, “You see, we don’t have any styles.

10:21.107 --> 10:23.218
This, we have been wearing from ages! Now,

10:23.418 --> 10:25.060
what style can we have?

10:25.260 --> 10:28.700
We don’t have Georgian, this, that style at all.

10:28.900 --> 10:31.790
It’s only one style, is kurta — that’s all.”

10:31.991 --> 10:33.757
So like that, you see,

10:33.957 --> 10:37.070
he was more worried about the style he would put up.

10:38.766 --> 10:40.179
And that’s what I am saying,

10:40.379 --> 10:41.868
that we have to understand

10:42.068 --> 10:46.068
that style cannot substitute your content.

10:48.213 --> 10:49.660
Be careful.

10:49.860 --> 10:52.493
So now not to express your feelings,

10:52.693 --> 10:54.460
you shouldn’t laugh

10:54.660 --> 10:57.860
you should sit like a monk.

10:58.060 --> 11:01.020
We don’t want monks here, all right?

11:01.760 --> 11:04.799
You have to really laugh aloud

11:05.134 --> 11:06.547
and enjoy

11:06.747 --> 11:09.865
and show your expression of your enjoyment.

11:11.539 --> 11:14.620
If you cannot laugh it out, if you do not know

11:14.820 --> 11:18.820
how to enjoy your Spirit, you are
not a Sahaja Yogi, finished! That’s all.

11:19.460 --> 11:23.044
If you are a Sahaj Yogi, then you
should be able to enjoy everything,

11:23.244 --> 11:25.860
every small thing you should enjoy.

11:28.077 --> 11:30.144
Once we climbed a

11:30.345 --> 11:33.540
hill to go to a temple to see it. It was an old temple,

11:33.740 --> 11:36.106
we went to see that and we had to climb quite a lot.

11:36.306 --> 11:38.583
My son in law, my daughter, they were exhausted,

11:38.783 --> 11:41.267
but I was enjoying everything. I didn’t feel anything.

11:41.467 --> 11:43.980
I went up and then I just

11:44.236 --> 11:45.580
- we all laid down there,

11:45.780 --> 11:49.547
in one of the outer sides of the temples. And

11:50.008 --> 11:52.740
he said, “I’m fed up of this,” my son in law said,

11:52.940 --> 11:54.660
“it’s too much to climb this.”

11:54.860 --> 11:58.820
I said, “Now watch these elephants,
see these elephants are so nicely done!

11:59.020 --> 12:01.421
Everybody has a different type of a tail!”

12:01.622 --> 12:05.562
He said, “Mummy how can you see tails at this time at this time

12:05.762 --> 12:07.460
when I’m so exhausted?”

12:07.660 --> 12:09.569
I said, “That’s how I don’t get exhausted!

12:09.769 --> 12:11.620
But you can see the tails, there are

12:11.820 --> 12:14.231
different, different types!” He said, “Just now I cannot”.

12:14.431 --> 12:18.020
I said, “You start seeing them,
you’ll forget it.” And really it happened.

12:19.509 --> 12:20.980
So one thing is:

12:21.180 --> 12:22.883
we are not any more English,

12:23.083 --> 12:26.740
or UK Sahaja Yogis, we are Sahaja Yogis of the God’s Kingdom.

12:27.222 --> 12:29.395
And we know what is the truth.

12:30.395 --> 12:33.476
And we are not going to make
ourselves miserable for nothing at all,

12:33.676 --> 12:35.819
because some of our great grandfathers

12:36.019 --> 12:37.939
have told us to put things like this,

12:38.139 --> 12:41.489
that you have not to express your feelings.

12:45.127 --> 12:48.822
But it was not so bad I must tell you when I first came,

12:49.158 --> 12:51.660
when I gave Realisation to Douglas.

12:51.860 --> 12:54.703
If you see him, he’ll remember. You see, he lost all balance,

12:54.903 --> 12:57.963
he just picked me up and put me up like that.

13:00.430 --> 13:03.860
And I felt that English have improved a lot!

13:07.061 --> 13:09.662
But Gregoire was there, he got nervous,

13:09.862 --> 13:11.486
“Put Her down! Put Her down!”

13:14.988 --> 13:18.466
So it was so simple, so spontaneous,

13:19.240 --> 13:21.500
so natural, you know.

13:22.786 --> 13:25.500
That is what we should understand: Are we natural?

13:25.854 --> 13:28.726
Are we spontaneous? Do we laugh a lot?

13:29.570 --> 13:32.399
Do we talk in a very

13:33.805 --> 13:35.305
open way?

13:36.748 --> 13:40.379
To be open hearted is wrong according to the old stupid

13:40.580 --> 13:42.900
traditions what you must have had.

13:43.560 --> 13:46.808
It’s wrong, absolutely wrong I tell you!

13:47.524 --> 13:49.980
So this is one of the things we must cut out that

13:50.180 --> 13:53.325
we have no other styles, but Sahaja Yoga style is to laugh,

13:53.525 --> 13:56.409
to talk to embrace everyone and to

13:56.609 --> 13:58.691
be joyous.

13:59.399 --> 14:00.899
That’s what we are.

14:01.100 --> 14:03.619
Because we know the knowledge, we are gnostics,

14:03.819 --> 14:06.020
they are not stupid blind people,

14:06.526 --> 14:08.386
who would wear their,

14:08.921 --> 14:10.980
black hats to go to church

14:11.180 --> 14:13.793
and sit over all the tombs there.

14:16.643 --> 14:18.340
We know such a lot.

14:19.158 --> 14:22.260
So this is first thing that we have no styles,

14:23.231 --> 14:24.860
no styles of any kind.

14:25.204 --> 14:28.220
Now some Sahaja Yogis went abroad got married,

14:28.420 --> 14:31.030
from UK and I have complaints about them,

14:31.230 --> 14:33.820
that they think they have become ladies and ladas.

14:34.020 --> 14:36.188
I said, “Eh? Ladies and ladas?

14:36.388 --> 14:38.247
They have had no jobs here,

14:38.447 --> 14:41.100
how have they become ladies? They said, “They have.

14:42.065 --> 14:44.063
Now they want to wear a kind of a hat

14:44.263 --> 14:46.995
and they want to wear this kind of a thing and

14:47.196 --> 14:49.220
some of them have become hippies!”

14:49.420 --> 14:52.340
I said, “Hippies, why? I can’t understand!”

14:52.799 --> 14:55.020
“And they don’t want to talk to anyone

14:55.220 --> 14:58.060
and they are stiff upper lip.”

14:58.745 --> 15:00.780
All English styles, you see!

15:01.036 --> 15:03.856
I said, “I hope they are not wearing tail coats

15:05.145 --> 15:08.127
borrowed from this Moss Bros.”

15:13.227 --> 15:16.420
So it was very

15:16.620 --> 15:19.366
sad because they would not go to any collective programmes,

15:19.566 --> 15:22.479
they would not, because, you know,
they have become now sahibs, you see!

15:22.679 --> 15:24.703
In India, they are called as sahibs.

15:24.903 --> 15:28.540
In India, if somebody tries to show too much style

15:28.740 --> 15:31.341
or tries to show that he’s some class,

15:31.541 --> 15:34.540
“Ha! Now he’s become a sahib! He’s become a sahib!”

15:35.257 --> 15:38.603
Sahib means, it’s condemnation. In India it is condemnation.

15:38.803 --> 15:42.013
But that’s what it is. It’s come from English only,

15:42.213 --> 15:45.724
because English would talk like that; sometimes

15:45.925 --> 15:47.657
in such a manner that,

15:47.928 --> 15:50.626
even he might be just a butler somewhere,

15:50.826 --> 15:53.780
but he would talk with such a big airs about him.

15:54.380 --> 15:56.185
But you are not that.

15:59.395 --> 16:00.835
And we have been thinking why,

16:01.035 --> 16:03.963
why is it, that the English cannot open their hearts?

16:04.163 --> 16:07.263
After all, you live on the heart of the whole universe!

16:08.518 --> 16:12.550
I mean, if you don’t open your hearts
who else is going to open their hearts?

16:14.441 --> 16:16.445
There’s no need to be vivacious, you see,

16:16.645 --> 16:19.843
talking like this, talking like that,
it’s not needed, I am not saying that,

16:20.043 --> 16:21.398
that, please understand.

16:21.598 --> 16:24.478
But I am saying, in a proper dignified manner,

16:24.678 --> 16:28.384
you have to laugh, you have to joke, you have to enjoy.

16:29.189 --> 16:32.624
Because there’s no joy inside that’s why it is so.

16:34.288 --> 16:36.460
Is it not? Or is there joy?

16:36.661 --> 16:40.397
And still you think, “If I laugh too much, what will people say?”

16:44.565 --> 16:48.092
So, this is one thing one has to understand: that all these artificialities

16:48.292 --> 16:51.635
are all stupid artificialities that were there.

16:52.439 --> 16:54.096
Like at the time

16:54.296 --> 16:56.470
you go to one of the queens parties

16:56.670 --> 16:59.620
— I must tell you about it because I’ve been to all this nonsense

16:59.820 --> 17:01.580
— and

17:02.148 --> 17:04.312
there are people who come in there,

17:04.512 --> 17:06.702
of course this Moss Bros. business again,

17:06.902 --> 17:09.545
they come in their tailcoats.

17:10.526 --> 17:12.053
And some get very

17:12.253 --> 17:15.500
tight ones and some get very loose ones, you see!

17:16.744 --> 17:19.900
The tight ones walk with such a funny gait, you don’t know

17:20.100 --> 17:22.015
what to do, you feel like laughing all the time

17:22.215 --> 17:23.740
and they look like jokers, I tell you.

17:23.941 --> 17:26.261
Very nice dignified people look like jokers.

17:26.461 --> 17:27.901
And the others who have

17:28.101 --> 17:30.865
loose ones walk like Charlie Chaplin.

17:33.118 --> 17:35.043
And I can never make them out,

17:35.243 --> 17:37.617
I tell you, I told CP, “Is he the same?”

17:37.817 --> 17:40.183
“Yes, he’s the same why?”, “I can’t make him out,

17:40.383 --> 17:43.134
he’s looking so different like Charlie Chaplin!”

17:43.658 --> 17:46.700
Might be, Charlie Chaplin might
have been to one of these such parties,

17:46.900 --> 17:49.540
I am sure, the way he had his dress made.

17:49.740 --> 17:52.460
Because this is absolutely there, I tell you.

17:52.660 --> 17:55.433
And then, they must have the tea, sit down,

17:55.633 --> 17:57.720
this, that nonsense, you see.

17:59.631 --> 18:02.882
What I am saying that all this trickles down to us

18:03.082 --> 18:07.044
from a man-made nonsensical idea.

18:08.305 --> 18:09.980
We are sitting

18:10.548 --> 18:12.609
in the Kingdom of God.

18:17.045 --> 18:20.300
So we are not going to do all these things.

18:23.540 --> 18:27.434
We are not going to indulge into all such nonsensical things,

18:27.635 --> 18:30.478
because it gives such an artificial superiority

18:30.678 --> 18:33.568
and cuts you off from the rest of the world.

18:39.052 --> 18:41.180
So I have to

18:41.380 --> 18:43.177
really tell you that,

18:44.230 --> 18:47.489
in this whatever has happened that the

18:49.926 --> 18:52.420
kind of artificiality

18:52.620 --> 18:54.337
that was built up,

18:56.561 --> 18:58.860
the reality had to give up.

18:59.686 --> 19:02.420
It couldn’t bear any more of that artificiality,

19:02.620 --> 19:04.324
it was too much.

19:06.645 --> 19:08.460
Now I'm trying to find

19:09.560 --> 19:13.560
out why this difference like I have seen Jeremy and Robert,

19:14.166 --> 19:16.780
they have become real Italians, I tell you.

19:16.980 --> 19:20.323
So once, we had gone for shopping and then we said,

19:20.523 --> 19:23.830
“Let’s have some ice cream!”
Guido is very good at taking me to ice cream shops,

19:24.030 --> 19:26.180
because I never eat otherwise!

19:26.380 --> 19:29.803
So we were there and suddenly we heard a big laughter coming.

19:30.003 --> 19:32.870
I said, “Looks like some Sahaja Yogis coming this side.”

19:33.070 --> 19:35.443
It was Baba Mama and these two

19:35.643 --> 19:38.582
coming down to the same shop,

19:39.164 --> 19:42.689
and laughing so loudly, that even the

19:46.742 --> 19:48.337
Italians were looking at them that,

19:48.560 --> 19:51.073
“Who are these greater Italians who have come here?”

19:51.964 --> 19:54.340
Three of them laughing and laughing!

19:54.540 --> 19:58.001
And they very quickly saw us and
they got a fright, because they were sitting.

19:58.201 --> 20:01.272
I said, “I am so happy to hear your laughter. All the way you came

20:01.472 --> 20:03.540
here and everybody was looking at you.”

20:03.740 --> 20:06.722
Because both of them know Italian language,

20:06.923 --> 20:08.910
they know another language.

20:10.058 --> 20:11.903
There’s another thing with us is that we don’t

20:12.103 --> 20:14.748
want to learn any other language.

20:14.949 --> 20:18.318
Everyone will have to jolly well learn English language,

20:18.518 --> 20:21.206
otherwise we think they are all stupid fools.

20:21.607 --> 20:23.387
And we make fun of them.

20:23.587 --> 20:26.504
I have seen so many films here — they show so many

20:26.704 --> 20:29.539
little, little dramas sometimes some sort of series coming

20:29.739 --> 20:31.054
— where the show a French

20:31.254 --> 20:33.365
speaking English in a funny way,

20:33.565 --> 20:35.638
or a German speaking in a funny way.

20:35.838 --> 20:37.890
And also I think English can

20:38.090 --> 20:40.220
speak in quite a funny way

20:41.241 --> 20:43.634
to me! Sometimes,

20:44.159 --> 20:45.904
it’s impossible.

20:46.560 --> 20:49.464
Like today, the ticket collector I don’t know what language he spoke,

20:49.695 --> 20:53.293
but I didn’t understand what he
was talking, he was trying to be nice.

20:53.493 --> 20:55.558
But I was looking at him, I was about to ask him,

20:55.758 --> 20:58.820
“Now, what Oxford English, or is it Cambridge English?

20:59.146 --> 21:00.663
I don’t understand.”

21:00.863 --> 21:03.031
That’s how. So what I am saying

21:03.231 --> 21:05.740
that language is just for communication.

21:06.660 --> 21:08.703
But in the communication, if there’s no love,

21:08.903 --> 21:12.354
if there’s no genuineness, if there’s no feeling, concern,

21:12.555 --> 21:15.460
why do we want to communicate with anyone?

21:16.484 --> 21:18.480
Just a lip service,

21:19.144 --> 21:20.644
no good.

21:24.304 --> 21:27.256
So now we are not only

21:29.041 --> 21:30.541
part and parcel

21:30.742 --> 21:33.260
of this world but of the whole.

21:35.380 --> 21:37.965
And everything circulates through you once you

21:38.591 --> 21:40.921
give up this insular feeling.

21:41.474 --> 21:43.955
But insulation is there, very much insulation,

21:44.156 --> 21:45.454
in the character, maybe because

21:45.654 --> 21:48.156
of England being an island.

21:49.161 --> 21:51.170
Except, as I was telling

21:51.371 --> 21:53.460
today to David, that except for

21:53.660 --> 21:56.700
attacking other people and going into up to even China

21:56.900 --> 21:59.900
up to Australia, otherwise they are insulated!

22:01.883 --> 22:04.253
So we must learn to watch ourselves,

22:04.453 --> 22:06.220
we must learn

22:08.270 --> 22:11.259
what is coming to us from our forefathers.

22:11.460 --> 22:13.740
This is the inheritance we have got!

22:16.711 --> 22:19.220
So suddenly we become lords,

22:19.640 --> 22:22.100
suddenly we become ladies,

22:23.835 --> 22:26.028
suddenly we become some sort of an

22:26.228 --> 22:27.835
English duke.

22:29.018 --> 22:32.900
In India they made a lot of fun. You must
have seen the dukes nose they have got it,

22:33.100 --> 22:34.754
given the name to

22:36.110 --> 22:38.340
one projection of a mountain,

22:38.540 --> 22:40.023
they call it, “This is a dukes nose,”

22:40.223 --> 22:43.491
because some duke must have gone with a nose like that.

22:48.258 --> 22:51.260
So we must learn to make fun of ourselves.

22:51.985 --> 22:54.220
Then all these things will disappear,

22:54.718 --> 22:56.180
and must understand that

22:56.380 --> 22:59.340
we are much higher people than this limited thing.

22:59.540 --> 23:00.860
It’s no good.

23:02.355 --> 23:04.233
And if we are following these old people

23:04.433 --> 23:07.385
then we can become bhootish with
them, because they were quite bhoots,

23:07.585 --> 23:09.428
can see them, they were quite bhoots, the way

23:09.628 --> 23:11.260
they did certain things.

23:11.461 --> 23:12.910
And now they are dead and gone,

23:13.110 --> 23:15.700
we are newly born, special people,

23:15.900 --> 23:17.500
we are flowers

23:17.943 --> 23:19.843
and we should be fragrant.

23:21.238 --> 23:23.100
And this is what happened with Gavin is that

23:23.300 --> 23:24.650
he’s gone down too much. And

23:24.851 --> 23:27.499
this Valerie is a character which is another horrible one.

23:27.699 --> 23:31.044
I just don’t know what to say about her — the less said the better.

23:31.496 --> 23:34.476
I mean I have never seen such a
person writing such a horrible thing,

23:34.676 --> 23:37.986
I have never heard that such books are written

23:38.186 --> 23:40.147
for general reading.

23:40.348 --> 23:43.100
I mean in India out of question!

23:43.300 --> 23:46.116
Even one sentence like that wont be permitted.

23:47.217 --> 23:50.060
Something that’s nauseating, absolutely nauseating.

23:50.260 --> 23:52.531
I couldn’t read of course, I am sorry to say but

23:52.732 --> 23:55.500
whatever I heard about it. And there were a few lines, they read it

23:55.700 --> 23:58.952
and I said, “Baba! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! I don’t want to vomit!”

24:02.367 --> 24:05.780
So to just to have a style and this and that,

24:07.327 --> 24:09.619
it is not all right.

24:10.540 --> 24:12.220
We are the Spirit

24:12.543 --> 24:15.660
and the Spirit is the light,

24:15.860 --> 24:18.100
light all around us,

24:19.420 --> 24:21.195
all around our auras.

24:21.395 --> 24:23.883
There are people walking with a special

24:24.443 --> 24:26.001
type of a personality,

24:26.201 --> 24:28.500
what do we need style for?

24:29.185 --> 24:31.883
Who has better style than ours?

24:33.646 --> 24:35.420
We make our own styles,

24:35.620 --> 24:37.718
we are the makers of styles.

24:40.656 --> 24:43.883
So to conform to some sort of a nonsensical idea

24:44.084 --> 24:47.180
and to secede yourself,

24:47.380 --> 24:49.700
to separate yourself, to cut yourself

24:49.900 --> 24:52.447
from the collective, is nonsensical.

24:53.378 --> 24:57.124
Now this time, those who are going
to India, I have to tell you one thing:

24:57.987 --> 25:00.326
that you must get mixed up with people.

25:00.526 --> 25:02.855
We’ll not have any camp which will have

25:03.055 --> 25:05.193
only English or this.

25:05.393 --> 25:07.016
And it’s a very common failing,

25:07.216 --> 25:10.961
we must face it. It’s a very common failing.
Because now, I’m in England, so I’m also English,

25:11.161 --> 25:13.220
but I don’t have this failing in me.

25:13.546 --> 25:17.220
But I have seen Indians, when they live here, they become like this.

25:19.343 --> 25:21.005
I went to a place

25:21.205 --> 25:24.755
called Mar del Plata in Argentina.

25:24.956 --> 25:28.671
It’s a very beautiful place, very beautiful colony of people.

25:28.872 --> 25:30.761
So I said, “Who are these people living here?”

25:30.962 --> 25:32.163
They said; “All Spanish,

25:32.363 --> 25:35.178
Italians, this, that.” “And English?”,

25:35.378 --> 25:38.620
“No! English have a separate colony of theirs.”

25:38.860 --> 25:41.020
But I wouldn’t be surprised tomorrow we have

25:41.220 --> 25:44.975
a separate colony of the English Indians;

25:45.372 --> 25:46.808
could be.

25:47.284 --> 25:49.310
They say in Sanskrit, “Sangati sanga doshena,”

25:49.510 --> 25:51.743
means, if you live with somebody, you become like that.

25:51.944 --> 25:54.677
So we might have some dukes and duchesses in the

25:54.878 --> 25:58.487
Indian community also possibly tomorrow if they live here

26:00.034 --> 26:01.592
— quite possible.

26:01.944 --> 26:03.587
This is such a,

26:04.629 --> 26:06.319
such a

26:07.826 --> 26:10.340
atmosphere, charged,

26:11.541 --> 26:14.260
“We are something special.”

26:15.555 --> 26:19.252
And it shows so clearly when they do to another country,

26:19.460 --> 26:21.420
it creates problems.

26:22.426 --> 26:24.412
They cannot mix up with people,

26:24.620 --> 26:26.435
they cannot talk to others,

26:26.636 --> 26:28.060
all the time

26:28.260 --> 26:32.260
they think they are like some media people, trying to criticise.

26:34.057 --> 26:37.299
The whole attitude is that

26:37.500 --> 26:41.116
we have to get mixed up with the whole ocean of Sahaja Yogis.

26:42.585 --> 26:44.439
Instead of that, if you

26:44.663 --> 26:46.540
behave like that, people think they

26:46.740 --> 26:48.660
are sort of

26:50.556 --> 26:52.340
criticising us.

26:55.365 --> 26:58.218
That’s why I have said many a times that we cannot use the word

26:58.418 --> 27:00.820
“I like” or “I believe”.

27:01.255 --> 27:03.340
No, not to use.

27:03.541 --> 27:05.105
Because that is how you despise others

27:05.305 --> 27:08.019
“I don’t like this, I don’t like that.”

27:08.219 --> 27:12.018
You may not even have half of this in the house, your own

27:12.592 --> 27:14.002
but they will say like that.

27:14.203 --> 27:17.226
You may not have food in the house to eat
but when they go to somebody’s house, they say,

27:17.427 --> 27:19.105
“I don’t like this food.”

27:20.086 --> 27:21.940
That we don’t have to have.

27:22.633 --> 27:26.633
All these things I have seen in him and that’s what I am telling you.

27:30.078 --> 27:33.420
Of course there are many books to read and we can.

27:33.690 --> 27:36.893
One good quality about English is that they are scholarly,

27:37.094 --> 27:39.380
they have scholarship. They read a lot, they know a lot.

27:39.580 --> 27:41.403
Ordinary person will also know.

27:41.603 --> 27:44.500
Also it being a very small country, they know about

27:44.700 --> 27:46.980
little, little places. You go anywhere they know,

27:47.180 --> 27:49.260
“This glass is from Darlington,

27:49.460 --> 27:50.740
this is from here,

27:50.940 --> 27:53.619
that is from there.” Indians wouldn’t know anything!

27:54.451 --> 27:56.940
And if you ask them, “This sari comes from where?”

27:57.140 --> 27:59.171
Men, especially, women may tell you.

27:59.371 --> 28:01.734
Women will say, “I don’t know, must be from India

28:01.934 --> 28:04.434
is it? Or is it from Kenya?”

28:08.615 --> 28:11.251
They know about birds, about from where they come.

28:11.451 --> 28:12.958
But all these things, you see,

28:13.158 --> 28:15.754
this knowledge sometimes can make us

28:15.955 --> 28:17.825
over nationalistic:

28:18.026 --> 28:20.060
“We the British!”

28:20.504 --> 28:22.004
It can come.

28:22.429 --> 28:24.140
Be careful on that point,

28:24.340 --> 28:26.487
to say, “We are the British.”

28:27.011 --> 28:28.596
We are not!

28:29.043 --> 28:31.500
We are not Indians, we are not British, we are nothing.

28:31.700 --> 28:33.020
We are gnostics.

28:33.220 --> 28:36.403
We are the ones who know. We are Yogis.

28:39.338 --> 28:43.346
Because this is such an artificial ego in our head

28:43.546 --> 28:46.893
and that has made people hate us,

28:48.211 --> 28:51.311
while we are here to love the whole world.

28:56.007 --> 28:59.460
So our beauty lies in

28:59.700 --> 29:02.220
how much we love others.

29:03.378 --> 29:06.771
We must face ourselves, see:

29:07.208 --> 29:09.540
“How much do we love,

29:10.739 --> 29:12.283
others?

29:13.037 --> 29:15.722
How much do we care for others?

29:17.204 --> 29:20.121
How much do we enjoy others?

29:21.649 --> 29:24.659
How do I feel when I face another Sahaja Yogi?”

29:25.314 --> 29:27.794
When I see you, a ripple

29:28.151 --> 29:31.179
of joy becomes like a thunder to me.

29:31.379 --> 29:33.015
I mean, I don’t know where I stand.

29:33.215 --> 29:36.820
And sometimes I feel I might just raise myself up in the heaven!

29:40.786 --> 29:44.420
That is the content within us of our Spirit.

29:45.035 --> 29:47.460
Not all these artificial things,

29:47.660 --> 29:49.540
they can never give us joy.

29:49.835 --> 29:52.135
They cannot give joy to anybody else.

29:52.830 --> 29:55.306
We have to be very simple people.

29:55.835 --> 29:58.500
Simple doesn’t mean that

29:59.131 --> 30:02.632
you should just wear some little few clothes, it doesn’t mean that.

30:02.945 --> 30:05.668
Simple, means from your heart.

30:06.830 --> 30:09.540
For small, small things you should feel happy.

30:09.740 --> 30:12.420
Simple things should make you happy.

30:16.512 --> 30:18.540
And that is how

30:19.626 --> 30:22.106
we’ll get closer to each other.

30:22.854 --> 30:24.700
Because this world has to be one.

30:24.900 --> 30:26.826
Now when it will be one Europe,

30:27.026 --> 30:29.820
what’s going happen to English I don’t know.

30:32.935 --> 30:36.180
They’ll have to jump in the sea I think because the way they will be

30:36.380 --> 30:39.309
encroached by all these people because

30:42.567 --> 30:44.955
they are in a way,

30:45.155 --> 30:47.374
in an English way, they are aggressive people, because

30:47.574 --> 30:50.373
if an Italian is there, he’ll just walk into your house

30:50.573 --> 30:52.787
and say, “What have you got for today’s dinner?”

30:52.988 --> 30:55.700
Quite possible! And you say, “What’s this?

30:55.900 --> 30:59.193
It’s very unmannerly to walk in my house!”

31:00.445 --> 31:02.498
Why do you have a house?

31:02.698 --> 31:04.796
Even a rat cannot walk into that house.

31:04.997 --> 31:06.821
You polish your,

31:07.205 --> 31:09.003
brass, you

31:09.620 --> 31:12.396
do all your cleanings, sweepings — for whom?

31:12.596 --> 31:14.278
There’s not even a rat

31:14.478 --> 31:16.940
in the house to come and see it.

31:19.149 --> 31:21.406
What’s the use of doing all this? Live like

31:21.606 --> 31:23.994
pigs then, better is that not to waste energy.

31:24.194 --> 31:25.702
Because there’s not even a,

31:26.194 --> 31:28.900
even a pig to come and see you!

31:32.632 --> 31:34.217
All right the climate is such,

31:34.417 --> 31:36.660
we can’t leave the doors open, all right,

31:36.860 --> 31:38.740
but hearts can be open.

31:41.511 --> 31:44.660
I have had lots of experiences of this myself.

31:44.860 --> 31:46.598
But in Sahaja Yoga, if it crawls up,

31:46.798 --> 31:49.500
then I don’t think our Sahaja Yoga can prosper,

31:49.700 --> 31:51.977
or people can have that content.

31:52.220 --> 31:54.643
The quality of Sahaja Yoga should be within us:

31:54.843 --> 31:57.034
how many people we give Realisation?

31:57.234 --> 31:58.947
How many people we can talk to?

31:59.147 --> 32:01.492
How much do we know about Sahaja Yoga?

32:03.042 --> 32:05.146
How much we have mastered it,

32:05.356 --> 32:07.137
how many people

32:08.314 --> 32:10.220
we get into Sahaja Yoga?

32:11.015 --> 32:12.600
Can we?

32:17.037 --> 32:19.752
It’s the circulation of the heart

32:20.673 --> 32:22.179
that is important.

32:22.379 --> 32:26.297
And if you cannot circulate why are you living on the heart?

32:27.244 --> 32:28.904
This is the

32:29.130 --> 32:30.643
country of heart

32:30.844 --> 32:32.300
where Shiva lives,

32:32.500 --> 32:35.317
where He is pulsating in everything

32:35.517 --> 32:37.275
— is pulsating in everything

32:37.476 --> 32:39.638
— and there where you are there,

32:39.839 --> 32:41.939
then what you should do?

32:49.413 --> 32:50.980
Circulation:

32:51.361 --> 32:53.420
how much you can circulate,

32:53.620 --> 32:55.660
articulate with people,

32:56.658 --> 32:58.274
rapport,

32:58.742 --> 33:02.352
understanding. Everywhere there’s joy,

33:02.553 --> 33:06.271
everywhere there’s understanding. Such

33:07.888 --> 33:12.032
oceans of depths people have

33:12.233 --> 33:14.758
but we must know how to penetrate into them.

33:14.958 --> 33:18.515
But if you want to have the pearls, you have to dive down.

33:18.715 --> 33:21.766
But if you want to live with the straw it is hanging there

33:21.967 --> 33:25.038
on the surface — live with it!

33:27.858 --> 33:31.420
We have come to Sahaja Yoga to become great people.

33:32.707 --> 33:35.260
We have been British, all right finished now, done!

33:35.461 --> 33:37.279
But now we had a second birth,

33:37.479 --> 33:39.493
we have entered into the Kingdom of God,

33:39.693 --> 33:42.060
now we are here to become great people,

33:42.260 --> 33:44.060
great monarchs.

33:46.520 --> 33:48.500
And these styles and all this have come

33:48.700 --> 33:51.191
from the so-called monarchs and kings

33:51.391 --> 33:53.651
and horrible people they were! Do you know that?

33:53.852 --> 33:56.695
They told me that Queen Elizabeth,

33:56.930 --> 33:59.992
the first one, had a kind of a funny patch here,

34:00.192 --> 34:03.690
they don’t know if she was a man or a woman, or whatever it is,

34:03.891 --> 34:06.500
whatever she was, man or a woman, or a person,

34:06.700 --> 34:08.940
this was the thing, she had a patch here.

34:09.140 --> 34:11.230
That’s why she made this

34:11.431 --> 34:12.980
kind of a collar

34:13.180 --> 34:15.220
for her which was standing here.

34:16.652 --> 34:18.740
And everybody had to wear that!

34:21.636 --> 34:23.537
And they said about Victoria also

34:23.738 --> 34:26.820
I don’t want to say anything against
her because I have great respect for her

34:27.020 --> 34:29.323
but they say she developed a hump on the back so she

34:29.523 --> 34:32.898
developed these Victorian skirts.

34:36.381 --> 34:40.293
So also you can see that hippyism started in England,

34:40.934 --> 34:43.300
punkism started in England.

34:44.907 --> 34:47.749
Imagine the punks! They are mad!

34:49.165 --> 34:51.336
And when I went to an

34:51.971 --> 34:54.556
exhibition in a

34:55.898 --> 34:57.329
Rome,

34:57.529 --> 34:59.523
beautiful exhibition it was,

34:59.723 --> 35:03.723
we were passing from one country
to another country, to another country,

35:04.737 --> 35:06.237
and there,

35:06.681 --> 35:09.573
I thought of England, because I
have become English as I told you.

35:09.773 --> 35:11.573
He said, “Where is UK?” He said, “It’s there!”

35:11.781 --> 35:14.221
And there were about six, seven

35:14.470 --> 35:15.910
boys from,

35:16.110 --> 35:19.664
mostly from Italy, and three, four girls laughing, “Ha! Ha!”

35:19.865 --> 35:23.389
I said, “What’s happening there? What’s the matter?

35:23.590 --> 35:27.005
Why are they laughing at the English,
when the English laugh at everyone?”

35:27.441 --> 35:30.141
And you know what was that? It was a punk shop

35:30.341 --> 35:33.841
— that’s the only thing they had for exhibition, believe me.

35:34.518 --> 35:36.300
Holey pants,

35:36.829 --> 35:39.100
holey, H O L E Y !

35:41.567 --> 35:44.788
Holey pants and they had these

35:45.482 --> 35:46.986
— what you call them,

35:47.735 --> 35:49.260
what do you call I don’t know that?

35:49.460 --> 35:51.140
We call toora in Hindi language

35:51.340 --> 35:54.980
that kind of thing — and all that, they were selling there.

35:56.931 --> 35:59.624
And they said, “It’s all genuine, genuine,

35:59.975 --> 36:01.980
genuine from England.”

36:03.033 --> 36:05.918
And all of these Italians were laughing.

36:06.119 --> 36:09.740
So I asked Flavia, “Why are they laughing at these British?”

36:10.012 --> 36:13.130
He said, “Mother, we have a sense of ridicule,

36:13.411 --> 36:15.540
we have a great sense of ridicule.”

36:16.304 --> 36:18.780
While these people were thinking, “So what?

36:18.980 --> 36:22.180
What’s wrong? If I cut my nose what’s wrong?”

36:23.928 --> 36:25.980
So ultimately we end up into this

36:26.180 --> 36:27.940
kind of a stupidity, as you know,

36:28.140 --> 36:31.780
that a person who has this kind of an ego becomes an idiot.

36:38.128 --> 36:42.071
And there are many things which you can see clearly how,

36:42.272 --> 36:44.995
how we thought that we were something great

36:45.195 --> 36:47.580
and how people befooled us.

36:48.437 --> 36:50.180
There’s a great writer in

36:50.380 --> 36:52.340
Hindi language called as Premchand.

36:52.540 --> 36:54.820
I must tell you his story it’s very interesting.

36:55.373 --> 36:57.340
We had English in India and we knew

36:57.540 --> 37:00.540
how to befool them, I must tell you, frankly.

37:01.921 --> 37:04.020
And there were two Englishmen

37:04.220 --> 37:06.340
going in a Benares street.

37:07.408 --> 37:11.060
And mostly in Benares, they have their WCs on top in the open.

37:11.260 --> 37:14.260
They sit there. And they had a,

37:14.733 --> 37:16.780
- we carry our

37:17.208 --> 37:20.108
jar, lota, they call it lota

37:21.004 --> 37:22.466
with the water.

37:22.667 --> 37:24.945
Somebody put the lota there,

37:25.146 --> 37:28.580
and suddenly, with some sort of a thing, it fell down.

37:28.780 --> 37:30.864
And it just fell down

37:31.434 --> 37:33.366
— are you recording me?

37:33.567 --> 37:36.140
Hello? Now don’t record this.

37:36.825 --> 37:38.700
You want to record it?

37:40.042 --> 37:41.852
Only for English all right.

37:42.052 --> 37:44.252
But don’t give it to anybody else!

37:46.226 --> 37:49.818
So the lota fell down and fell down.

37:50.019 --> 37:53.334
And he describes, “Fell on the feet

37:53.725 --> 37:55.494
of those where many

37:55.694 --> 37:58.323
Indians go and put there heads.”

37:58.523 --> 37:59.938
So I said, “What that must be?”

38:00.138 --> 38:02.819
They were the feet of two Englishmen.

38:03.020 --> 38:05.069
And then the Englishmen got angry,

38:05.269 --> 38:08.940
because according to their country’s law nothing can be hurt.

38:09.140 --> 38:12.420
And they took the lota they said,
“We are taking you to the police now.

38:12.621 --> 38:15.048
This has hurt us so much!”

38:16.061 --> 38:17.860
So, you see,

38:18.060 --> 38:20.533
the man who was upstairs came running,

38:20.733 --> 38:22.845
said, “Sorry, sorry!” He said, “Nothing doing,

38:23.045 --> 38:26.117
we are going to take you to the police! It has hurt us.

38:26.318 --> 38:29.660
You had no business to keep a lota there that it fell on our feet.”

38:29.860 --> 38:31.580
In India, nobody compensates.

38:31.780 --> 38:33.567
But if an Englishman comes and says, all right,

38:33.767 --> 38:36.154
they’ll say, “Baba, it’s all right, what to do?”

38:37.359 --> 38:40.672
So there was one fellow who thought of a trick.

38:42.587 --> 38:45.793
So he knew English. He said, “See,

38:45.994 --> 38:49.420
you can take them to police.
At most police will fine them a little bit.

38:49.620 --> 38:52.083
But do you know this lota?” He said, “What?”

38:52.283 --> 38:55.145
“This lota belonged to Akbar.

38:55.346 --> 38:58.131
Akbar used to carry this lota with him,

38:58.332 --> 39:02.197
so instead of taking them if you ask for this lota

39:02.397 --> 39:05.291
will be a good idea its an antique piece you see.

39:06.580 --> 39:08.083
Will be good for you

39:08.283 --> 39:10.935
Akbar the great used to take this!”

39:11.656 --> 39:13.863
And he told in Hindi language to them that,

39:14.064 --> 39:15.610
“I have befooled them and I have told then

39:15.810 --> 39:17.540
this belonged to Akbar and you just say

39:17.740 --> 39:20.891
that ‘We don’t want to give this lota and you can take us to police!’

39:21.448 --> 39:23.795
So they said, “Now, all right.

39:23.995 --> 39:27.131
If you give us this lota, then we’ll forgive you!”

39:27.332 --> 39:30.251
So these people said, “No we don’t want to give this lota.”

39:30.451 --> 39:33.190
“Why?” “Because it belonged to Akbar!

39:33.877 --> 39:37.058
How can we give such a lota? He was our forefather.

39:37.258 --> 39:39.580
We can’t give our lota to you!”

39:40.124 --> 39:42.791
So then the English said, “All right,

39:43.007 --> 39:45.941
then are you willing to come to police?”
“Yes, yes, we are willing to come to police

39:46.141 --> 39:47.700
but we can’t give you this lota!”

39:47.901 --> 39:51.620
So they paid lot of money for that lota and bought it.

39:58.476 --> 40:01.016
And they were very proud, you see.

40:01.727 --> 40:04.647
And they took that lota and they must have put it in some frame

40:04.847 --> 40:08.847
to say that this is was the lota which was carried by Akbar.

40:09.605 --> 40:11.393
So this is how it is.

40:12.221 --> 40:14.809
So first we must have respect for

40:15.010 --> 40:18.090
other cultures, other things and other people

40:18.290 --> 40:19.948
and other countries and try to

40:20.148 --> 40:22.760
see what they have good about them.

40:23.964 --> 40:26.831
Otherwise nothing will penetrate into you

40:27.788 --> 40:30.411
and you will be left high and dry all your life.

40:30.612 --> 40:33.386
There’s so many nice things in this world.

40:34.455 --> 40:37.180
Say you go to Italy — see the beautiful

40:37.380 --> 40:39.500
work they do, the furniture they make,

40:39.700 --> 40:41.811
things they make. Once they come to

40:42.011 --> 40:44.631
England I don’t know what’s going to happen to us.

40:44.839 --> 40:47.777
We had lots of beautiful

40:48.036 --> 40:52.036
art and we had talents, but all finished now, nobody is having that.

40:52.675 --> 40:55.102
And when they come here what is going to happen?

40:55.303 --> 40:57.740
In machinery, when the Germans come here,

40:58.082 --> 40:59.768
they’ll finish us off.

41:02.099 --> 41:05.481
So we have to realise that these outside things and

41:05.682 --> 41:08.528
thinking that we are something great, is not greatness.

41:08.728 --> 41:12.460
Greatness is within yourself, within your heart.

41:16.754 --> 41:18.620
And it is so much,

41:18.820 --> 41:22.193
so much evident, so much evident here,

41:22.394 --> 41:24.780
that it’s really shocking.

41:29.650 --> 41:31.180
As a reaction to all that

41:31.380 --> 41:34.100
formalities and all that, people might have taken to

41:34.300 --> 41:37.053
very casual dresses, all right.

41:37.253 --> 41:41.019
But that’s not the way, because from inside it has to go.

41:41.951 --> 41:43.728
All these ideas have to

41:43.928 --> 41:47.207
be washed off completely, cleaned off.

41:48.278 --> 41:49.780
And we have to know that

41:49.980 --> 41:52.540
we are the ones, we have to give light of the Spirit

41:52.740 --> 41:54.460
to the whole world.

41:55.807 --> 41:57.511
And how can we cover and

41:57.711 --> 42:00.447
cloud ourselves with all these funny ideas?

42:01.136 --> 42:05.060
And that’s why so many of you,
you have asked me questions about Gavin.

42:05.260 --> 42:07.340
Only thing I have to say that,

42:07.844 --> 42:10.660
to this extent, only an Englishman can go

42:10.860 --> 42:12.980
because he can forgive himself.

42:13.914 --> 42:16.343
To this extent nobody else can go.

42:16.615 --> 42:20.227
Nobody has done like this. No one has done like this.

42:20.428 --> 42:24.031
We had so many people removed
from Sahaja Yoga, you know that very well.

42:24.232 --> 42:28.083
But the way he has gone down and the way he was with us for the

42:28.283 --> 42:30.507
last fourteen years, it’s surprising.

42:30.707 --> 42:32.580
And I understand that people ask me

42:32.780 --> 42:34.663
questions, I understand why it is happening.

42:34.812 --> 42:36.380
But be careful now!

42:37.862 --> 42:39.993
Let us not be

42:40.193 --> 42:43.993
lost with these foolish stupid ideas we had.

42:45.487 --> 42:47.356
And let us be something great.

42:47.556 --> 42:51.067
Let us be within ourselves, see for ourselves.

42:51.267 --> 42:53.571
No amount of arrogance,

42:53.771 --> 42:56.100
no amount of artificiality

42:56.300 --> 42:59.020
is going to give us any special personality,

42:59.220 --> 43:02.140
except that we realise what we are.

43:02.340 --> 43:04.380
And when we know what we are,

43:04.580 --> 43:07.363
we enjoy ourselves, we never get bored,

43:07.563 --> 43:09.580
we enjoy ourselves

43:10.070 --> 43:11.570
— never get bored.

43:14.219 --> 43:18.219
So at the beginning of the programme I have to say that

43:18.420 --> 43:21.620
I have seen the Sahaja Yogis if they want to be good they can be

43:21.820 --> 43:23.936
really very good people,

43:24.137 --> 43:27.340
in England, because the quality

43:28.322 --> 43:31.820
of intelligence is much better,

43:32.177 --> 43:35.620
perhaps, also their scholarship is very good.

43:36.614 --> 43:39.102
But when they fall,

43:39.302 --> 43:41.947
they fall also very fast

43:42.736 --> 43:45.300
and go down very much.

43:46.267 --> 43:48.294
So on what we have to depend

43:48.494 --> 43:51.385
is to our step

43:51.585 --> 43:55.493
where we are standing and what step we are going to take further.

43:55.694 --> 43:57.691
For example meditating:

43:57.891 --> 44:01.608
Dr. Brian Wells told me that people don’t want to meditate

44:01.809 --> 44:03.388
in the ashram.

44:03.668 --> 44:07.668
Now meditation is very important, is the only way we can grow.

44:09.260 --> 44:11.585
Now all right, people used to get up,

44:11.785 --> 44:13.341
say about ten o’clock before.

44:13.542 --> 44:15.054
But do you don’t get drunk,

44:15.254 --> 44:17.415
why should you get up at ten o’clock?

44:18.055 --> 44:21.928
You have to get up in the morning. You have to look after yourself:

44:22.128 --> 44:24.868
means you have to look after your Spirit!

44:25.743 --> 44:28.500
And that’s what we have to achieve.

44:29.006 --> 44:32.140
And I know if you all decide you can do it very well.

44:32.568 --> 44:34.620
Among yourselves

44:36.308 --> 44:39.140
is better understanding

44:39.990 --> 44:42.420
but when it comes to others

44:42.620 --> 44:44.940
it seems there’s some sort of a

44:46.023 --> 44:47.842
communication gap

44:49.402 --> 44:51.002
which should not be.

44:51.392 --> 44:54.900
If the Germans could be that gentle and so sweet.

44:55.102 --> 44:56.835
You’ve seen the German people

44:57.036 --> 44:58.653
who are Sahaj Yogis

44:58.853 --> 45:00.777
— even to touch a flower

45:00.977 --> 45:04.977
is easier than to touch a German I
tell you they have become so gentle,

45:05.180 --> 45:07.140
because they have learnt a lesson.

45:07.340 --> 45:10.420
And I asked a German, “What’s the matter with English?

45:10.620 --> 45:12.420
Why haven’t they learnt a lesson?”

45:12.620 --> 45:14.362
He answered me back,

45:14.562 --> 45:16.820
which is a very important thing to know,

45:17.020 --> 45:19.340
“They have never lost a war Mother.

45:20.002 --> 45:23.202
They have to lose one war, they’ll be all right.”

45:32.081 --> 45:35.460
So the gentleness,

45:36.028 --> 45:37.765
which is not outward,

45:37.965 --> 45:40.540
which is not just a lip service,

45:41.560 --> 45:43.060
but from within:

45:43.261 --> 45:45.472
“How can they hurt someone?”

45:48.414 --> 45:50.902
I mean, I had to put myself into

45:51.102 --> 45:53.691
a frame of mind to talk to you like this.

45:54.009 --> 45:57.379
And I didn’t know how many flowers I should

45:57.580 --> 46:01.580
weave round my words so that it should not hurt you.

46:06.678 --> 46:08.580
And even then, you see,

46:08.780 --> 46:11.285
the back of my mind, there’s a kind of a sadness,

46:11.485 --> 46:13.504
because I love you so much

46:13.705 --> 46:17.705
and it shows that I have stayed with you the most of the time.

46:18.860 --> 46:20.446
You are specially privileged.

46:20.646 --> 46:22.350
But that should give you

46:22.585 --> 46:24.282
greater humility.

46:24.500 --> 46:26.261
Because whatever are my qualities

46:26.461 --> 46:28.314
they should be much more in you

46:28.514 --> 46:31.485
and be shown to people that they
should, “Oh, English, we can make out,

46:31.685 --> 46:33.940
they’re like Mother to look at.

46:34.140 --> 46:37.220
They are like Mother to behave. They are just like Mother.”

46:37.593 --> 46:39.340
Let me hear that.

46:41.388 --> 46:44.075
All right? So it’s a promise to me

46:44.276 --> 46:47.060
— is it all right? — on an Ashtami day.

46:47.260 --> 46:48.911
Let us finish all these negativities

46:49.111 --> 46:53.020
and let us become that special type of people

46:53.220 --> 46:56.279
- who are worshipped all over. - All right?

46:56.480 --> 46:58.080
May God Bless You.
