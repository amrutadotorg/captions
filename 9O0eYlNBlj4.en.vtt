00:01:04.016 --> 00:01:07.226
﻿Today is the eighth day

00:01:07.426 --> 00:01:09.620
of the Devi puja,

00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:13.339
and on this day,

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:15.580
the power of

00:01:15.867 --> 00:01:17.460
Kali acts

00:01:18.583 --> 00:01:20.620
and She is the one

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.701
called as Samhara Kali,

00:01:22.949 --> 00:01:25.157
meaning the one who

00:01:25.876 --> 00:01:28.747
destroys all the evil forces.

00:01:28.947 --> 00:01:31.651
So it is a very good day,

00:01:31.852 --> 00:01:34.823
that we have a puja here, in England.

00:01:35.024 --> 00:01:37.032
I am very happy about it.

00:01:37.805 --> 00:01:39.420
My spectacles?

00:01:40.543 --> 00:01:43.460
In my purse, I think so.

00:01:44.371 --> 00:01:46.440
Where is she? She’s got it?

00:01:49.805 --> 00:01:51.220
Now,

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.635
I was thinking that I should

00:01:56.835 --> 00:02:00.780
talk to the UK Sahaja Yogis, because very important.

00:02:02.338 --> 00:02:05.203
I’ll be completing now sixteen years

00:02:05.403 --> 00:02:07.030
of my stay in UK

00:02:07.254 --> 00:02:10.818
and I have really found such love and such

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:13.100
goodness about you people.

00:02:15.356 --> 00:02:17.867
Now next year, I will not be

00:02:18.067 --> 00:02:21.900
staying here because my husband is going to be transferred

00:02:22.891 --> 00:02:26.740
and of course and I’ll be coming back

00:02:27.207 --> 00:02:29.978
and for a month or so, I could be with you,

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:32.980
maybe much more closer than

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.300
I have been so far.

00:02:36.048 --> 00:02:38.098
But there’s something that

00:02:38.298 --> 00:02:41.620
I think I should warn you people, because now

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.565
I’m receiving lots of letters about Gavin asking,

00:02:44.765 --> 00:02:48.060
“Why Gavin has become like that? What’s gone wrong with him?”

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.502
Perhaps everybody seems to quite frightened to see

00:02:52.252 --> 00:02:56.180
these things happening and to some other Sahaj Yogis also.

00:02:56.818 --> 00:02:59.139
Because in other countries, when the

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.740
Sahaj Yogis go out of Sahaja Yoga,

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.056
they don’t get after me, or they don’t get after

00:03:04.256 --> 00:03:06.218
Sahaja Yoga or Sahaj Yogis.

00:03:06.418 --> 00:03:10.340
But they think there’s something wrong
with them and they feel very sorry and keep out.

00:03:10.678 --> 00:03:14.283
But why is it that Gavin has become so adamant and

00:03:14.484 --> 00:03:17.127
is becoming so much against us?

00:03:17.327 --> 00:03:19.450
And I am told he’s supplying

00:03:19.651 --> 00:03:23.651
information to some horrible organisations and things like that.

00:03:25.002 --> 00:03:26.923
I mean I don’t know how to explain human

00:03:27.123 --> 00:03:29.443
behaviour. It’s difficult because

00:03:29.643 --> 00:03:33.580
when you have found out
something so great and if you cannot value it,

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.200
what happens? Why?

00:03:37.737 --> 00:03:41.220
So, I feel that

00:03:42.234 --> 00:03:45.238
English have so many great qualities among them

00:03:45.446 --> 00:03:47.267
because at the time of crisis

00:03:47.467 --> 00:03:49.588
they are the ones who have always stood up.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.992
Because of them we could avert the war,

00:03:52.192 --> 00:03:55.380
second world war, was averted because of them.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.327
Not only that, but also

00:03:58.968 --> 00:04:01.228
they work out things at the

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:03.129
nick of the time,

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.330
whenever it is necessary. And

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:12.060
their whole style is

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.042
very quiet

00:04:16.242 --> 00:04:19.780
and they show results at the right time,

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.825
that’s a fact, no doubt. One has to accept it.

00:04:23.026 --> 00:04:25.364
All these qualities are there, but I think there are

00:04:25.564 --> 00:04:27.826
certain other things which have crawled up and

00:04:28.026 --> 00:04:30.641
maybe that’s one of the reasons we have to guard against,

00:04:30.841 --> 00:04:32.261
if you have to keep to Sahaja Yoga,

00:04:32.461 --> 00:04:34.098
if you have to grow in Sahaja Yog.

00:04:36.142 --> 00:04:39.252
So one of the things I have found out that

00:04:39.534 --> 00:04:42.540
English believe more in the style,

00:04:43.193 --> 00:04:45.401
what your style is.

00:04:47.758 --> 00:04:51.064
Say, like a cocktail style,

00:04:51.264 --> 00:04:53.701
you can call it, or a dandy style

00:04:53.901 --> 00:04:57.754
then a punk style and this style and that style.

00:04:57.955 --> 00:04:59.740
You have got tailcoat style.

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.900
All sorts of styles here, they say.

00:05:03.243 --> 00:05:07.265
And because too much of it, in the atmosphere, too much.

00:05:07.466 --> 00:05:09.399
As soon as you see a house they’ll tell you,

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:12.535
“Oh, this is Georgian!”

00:05:12.735 --> 00:05:14.174
“This is

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:18.742
such and such,” and “This is Neo this and that!”

00:05:18.942 --> 00:05:21.727
So, you see, it must go up to that style,

00:05:21.927 --> 00:05:23.860
it has to be that style.

00:05:24.461 --> 00:05:27.947
And any house

00:05:28.147 --> 00:05:30.261
which is not to that style,

00:05:30.461 --> 00:05:32.790
then they’ll say, “Oh, it’s a compromise!”

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.712
It's a little,

00:05:35.657 --> 00:05:37.487
it's a little fussy or I don’t know

00:05:37.687 --> 00:05:40.180
what all words they use to criticise such a thing.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.853
So this is one thing we have to know that styles

00:05:44.053 --> 00:05:46.500
cannot substitute the content.

00:05:48.004 --> 00:05:49.740
It cannot be a substitute.

00:05:49.964 --> 00:05:51.486
Style is so outward

00:05:51.687 --> 00:05:53.545
and so,

00:05:54.185 --> 00:05:55.778
so deceptive.

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:58.636
It is so deceptive and so outward

00:05:58.837 --> 00:06:01.900
that it deceives us also.

00:06:02.201 --> 00:06:04.250
It deceives us also.

00:06:06.136 --> 00:06:09.184
Like, if we feel that we are a class,

00:06:09.384 --> 00:06:12.620
or something, there’s class consciousness also quite a lot.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.203
If we start thinking, we are class.

00:06:15.403 --> 00:06:18.138
Then I mean, one has to know that

00:06:18.338 --> 00:06:20.470
this is something very man made stuff

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:22.340
— to be a class.

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.255
If you say, “I am a class.” That means it’s all man made.

00:06:25.455 --> 00:06:27.907
It’s not the way the Divine is.

00:06:28.107 --> 00:06:30.805
Divine doesn’t have all these

00:06:31.005 --> 00:06:32.540
differentiations.

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:36.740
You are a class Sahaja Yogi, means in your content,

00:06:37.423 --> 00:06:40.660
within yourself, you have such powers;

00:06:41.813 --> 00:06:45.500
that you can face yourself happily and you enjoy yourself,

00:06:45.707 --> 00:06:47.413
and you know yourself.

00:06:48.154 --> 00:06:50.780
That is what is a class in Sahaj Yoga,

00:06:51.255 --> 00:06:54.220
not how you dress up or how you talk

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:58.380
of you hold your fork and spoon — it’s not the way.

00:06:58.839 --> 00:07:00.380
So this style

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:04.220
that we think of is no substitute for the contents.

00:07:05.023 --> 00:07:08.046
Now this thing works out better with this

00:07:08.246 --> 00:07:10.540
outside culture that we have,

00:07:11.233 --> 00:07:13.566
that you should not express your feelings.

00:07:13.766 --> 00:07:16.300
This is another nonsense they have taught us,

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.940
in this country, which is all nonsense, absolute nonsense

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.467
— you should not express your feelings and

00:07:22.667 --> 00:07:25.605
you should be poised.

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:28.226
And

00:07:28.427 --> 00:07:29.979
say somebody's dead,

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:33.883
somebody died, in our friend, I mean in our circle,

00:07:34.084 --> 00:07:36.588
and Mr. Shrivastava went there. Thank God,

00:07:36.788 --> 00:07:40.062
I had no black sari so I didn’t go! But you must go in the black sari,

00:07:40.262 --> 00:07:41.940
and black blouse

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:45.105
and black everything and the black bangles and I said,

00:07:45.305 --> 00:07:49.300
“Baba, I don’t have all these black,
black things, so what to do?” So I didn’t go.

00:07:49.741 --> 00:07:52.140
I mean what is there? A person is dead now,

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:55.780
he doesn’t see you whether you’re in black or red, you see?

00:07:59.411 --> 00:08:01.700
But one thing is there, definitely,

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.398
that if you wear something, you see.

00:08:04.598 --> 00:08:06.885
Whatever you wear, you express the inside,

00:08:07.085 --> 00:08:10.540
the content within you, that you’re so sad and unhappy.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.844
And then he went and

00:08:13.044 --> 00:08:15.140
there was a champagne for that!

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:17.875
I mean, somebody is born you have a champagne

00:08:18.075 --> 00:08:21.117
somebody dies you have a champagne, I mean anyway.

00:08:21.318 --> 00:08:23.685
So champagne has nothing to do with the style,

00:08:23.885 --> 00:08:25.687
they can have at any time.

00:08:25.888 --> 00:08:29.900
But the style was, you must wear black, everything black.

00:08:30.774 --> 00:08:32.660
I said, “This is too much!” I mean

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:36.860
at the most one could have some strip of black to suggest.

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:39.540
But what is there to suggest, if somebody is dead?

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:42.878
I mean you do feel inside. And he was looking very sick,

00:08:43.078 --> 00:08:45.226
my husband was looking very sick, because

00:08:45.426 --> 00:08:48.977
he was feeling so sad really that he had lost a friend.

00:08:49.177 --> 00:08:50.677
I also cried.

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:53.541
So they said, “What’s the matter, are you not well?”

00:08:53.741 --> 00:08:56.318
They were all laughing, joking,

00:08:56.518 --> 00:08:59.418
and the dead body was lying in the next room!

00:09:01.308 --> 00:09:03.553
So C.P. said, “No, but such a friend!”

00:09:03.753 --> 00:09:07.296
“Oh! Be poised! You have no poise, Mr Srivastava!”

00:09:07.744 --> 00:09:09.798
And one lady had gone, whom

00:09:09.999 --> 00:09:11.756
she’s also our common friend,

00:09:11.956 --> 00:09:14.060
she’s from, I think, Ghana or some place,

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.420
and she started crying, you know,

00:09:16.748 --> 00:09:20.249
naturally. I would have also have also cried, thank God I didn’t go.

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:22.340
So they all criticised her,

00:09:23.328 --> 00:09:27.020
“This is not proper, she should not
have done all this things,” and all that.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.178
So all these ideas, you see,

00:09:30.378 --> 00:09:32.831
every country has some sort of a conditioning

00:09:33.031 --> 00:09:35.940
and we must realise what our conditionings are.

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:40.114
Then we are all right. Because we have to
break all our conditionings in every country.

00:09:40.315 --> 00:09:43.867
The best thing about Sahaja Yogis
is that once they become a Sahaja Yogi,

00:09:44.067 --> 00:09:46.295
they see the problems of their own country.

00:09:46.495 --> 00:09:48.580
This is the best thing we have.

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:50.740
And they laugh at the people who are there.

00:09:50.941 --> 00:09:54.526
But still we must know there might
be some subtle things lying within us,

00:09:54.726 --> 00:09:57.940
because from this case of Gavin, now you can see clearly.

00:09:58.454 --> 00:10:01.220
You see, he had a style, always he had a style for everything:

00:10:01.421 --> 00:10:02.923
for puja he’ll have a style,

00:10:03.123 --> 00:10:05.946
this thing he’ll have a style, that thing he’ll have style.

00:10:06.146 --> 00:10:08.751
So I used to little bit doubt him. I said,

00:10:08.951 --> 00:10:11.701
“Why is he’s so much worried about his style?”

00:10:12.418 --> 00:10:15.075
For small, small things. Even if he’ll wear

00:10:15.276 --> 00:10:17.645
an Indian dress, he will think of a style,

00:10:17.845 --> 00:10:20.906
what style it is. I said, “You see, we don’t have any styles.

00:10:21.107 --> 00:10:23.218
This, we have been wearing from ages! Now,

00:10:23.418 --> 00:10:25.060
what style can we have?

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.700
We don’t have Georgian, this, that style at all.

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.790
It’s only one style, is kurta — that’s all.”

00:10:31.991 --> 00:10:33.757
So like that, you see,

00:10:33.957 --> 00:10:37.070
he was more worried about the style he would put up.

00:10:38.766 --> 00:10:40.179
And that’s what I am saying,

00:10:40.379 --> 00:10:41.868
that we have to understand

00:10:42.068 --> 00:10:46.068
that style cannot substitute your content.

00:10:48.213 --> 00:10:49.660
Be careful.

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:52.493
So now not to express your feelings,

00:10:52.693 --> 00:10:54.460
you shouldn’t laugh

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:57.860
you should sit like a monk.

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:01.020
We don’t want monks here, all right?

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:04.799
You have to really laugh aloud

00:11:05.134 --> 00:11:06.547
and enjoy

00:11:06.747 --> 00:11:09.865
and show your expression of your enjoyment.

00:11:11.539 --> 00:11:14.620
If you cannot laugh it out, if you do not know

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:18.820
how to enjoy your Spirit, you are
not a Sahaja Yogi, finished! That’s all.

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:23.044
If you are a Sahaj Yogi, then you
should be able to enjoy everything,

00:11:23.244 --> 00:11:25.860
every small thing you should enjoy.

00:11:28.077 --> 00:11:30.144
Once we climbed a

00:11:30.345 --> 00:11:33.540
hill to go to a temple to see it. It was an old temple,

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:36.106
we went to see that and we had to climb quite a lot.

00:11:36.306 --> 00:11:38.583
My son in law, my daughter, they were exhausted,

00:11:38.783 --> 00:11:41.267
but I was enjoying everything. I didn’t feel anything.

00:11:41.467 --> 00:11:43.980
I went up and then I just

00:11:44.236 --> 00:11:45.580
- we all laid down there,

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:49.547
in one of the outer sides of the temples. And

00:11:50.008 --> 00:11:52.740
he said, “I’m fed up of this,” my son in law said,

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:54.660
“it’s too much to climb this.”

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:58.820
I said, “Now watch these elephants,
see these elephants are so nicely done!

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:01.421
Everybody has a different type of a tail!”

00:12:01.622 --> 00:12:05.562
He said, “Mummy how can you see tails at this time at this time

00:12:05.762 --> 00:12:07.460
when I’m so exhausted?”

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.569
I said, “That’s how I don’t get exhausted!

00:12:09.769 --> 00:12:11.620
But you can see the tails, there are

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:14.231
different, different types!” He said, “Just now I cannot”.

00:12:14.431 --> 00:12:18.020
I said, “You start seeing them,
you’ll forget it.” And really it happened.

00:12:19.509 --> 00:12:20.980
So one thing is:

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:22.883
we are not any more English,

00:12:23.083 --> 00:12:26.740
or UK Sahaja Yogis, we are Sahaja Yogis of the God’s Kingdom.

00:12:27.222 --> 00:12:29.395
And we know what is the truth.

00:12:30.395 --> 00:12:33.476
And we are not going to make
ourselves miserable for nothing at all,

00:12:33.676 --> 00:12:35.819
because some of our great grandfathers

00:12:36.019 --> 00:12:37.939
have told us to put things like this,

00:12:38.139 --> 00:12:41.489
that you have not to express your feelings.

00:12:45.127 --> 00:12:48.822
But it was not so bad I must tell you when I first came,

00:12:49.158 --> 00:12:51.660
when I gave Realisation to Douglas.

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:54.703
If you see him, he’ll remember. You see, he lost all balance,

00:12:54.903 --> 00:12:57.963
he just picked me up and put me up like that.

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:03.860
And I felt that English have improved a lot!

00:13:07.061 --> 00:13:09.662
But Gregoire was there, he got nervous,

00:13:09.862 --> 00:13:11.486
“Put Her down! Put Her down!”

00:13:14.988 --> 00:13:18.466
So it was so simple, so spontaneous,

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:21.500
so natural, you know.

00:13:22.786 --> 00:13:25.500
That is what we should understand: Are we natural?

00:13:25.854 --> 00:13:28.726
Are we spontaneous? Do we laugh a lot?

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:32.399
Do we talk in a very

00:13:33.805 --> 00:13:35.305
open way?

00:13:36.748 --> 00:13:40.379
To be open hearted is wrong according to the old stupid

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:42.900
traditions what you must have had.

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:46.808
It’s wrong, absolutely wrong I tell you!

00:13:47.524 --> 00:13:49.980
So this is one of the things we must cut out that

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:53.325
we have no other styles, but Sahaja Yoga style is to laugh,

00:13:53.525 --> 00:13:56.409
to talk to embrace everyone and to

00:13:56.609 --> 00:13:58.691
be joyous.

00:13:59.399 --> 00:14:00.899
That’s what we are.

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:03.619
Because we know the knowledge, we are gnostics,

00:14:03.819 --> 00:14:06.020
they are not stupid blind people,

00:14:06.526 --> 00:14:08.386
who would wear their,

00:14:08.921 --> 00:14:10.980
black hats to go to church

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:13.793
and sit over all the tombs there.

00:14:16.643 --> 00:14:18.340
We know such a lot.

00:14:19.158 --> 00:14:22.260
So this is first thing that we have no styles,

00:14:23.231 --> 00:14:24.860
no styles of any kind.

00:14:25.204 --> 00:14:28.220
Now some Sahaja Yogis went abroad got married,

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:31.030
from UK and I have complaints about them,

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:33.820
that they think they have become ladies and ladas.

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:36.188
I said, “Eh? Ladies and ladas?

00:14:36.388 --> 00:14:38.247
They have had no jobs here,

00:14:38.447 --> 00:14:41.100
how have they become ladies? They said, “They have.

00:14:42.065 --> 00:14:44.063
Now they want to wear a kind of a hat

00:14:44.263 --> 00:14:46.995
and they want to wear this kind of a thing and

00:14:47.196 --> 00:14:49.220
some of them have become hippies!”

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:52.340
I said, “Hippies, why? I can’t understand!”

00:14:52.799 --> 00:14:55.020
“And they don’t want to talk to anyone

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:58.060
and they are stiff upper lip.”

00:14:58.745 --> 00:15:00.780
All English styles, you see!

00:15:01.036 --> 00:15:03.856
I said, “I hope they are not wearing tail coats

00:15:05.145 --> 00:15:08.127
borrowed from this Moss Bros.”

00:15:13.227 --> 00:15:16.420
So it was very

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:19.366
sad because they would not go to any collective programmes,

00:15:19.566 --> 00:15:22.479
they would not, because, you know,
they have become now sahibs, you see!

00:15:22.679 --> 00:15:24.703
In India, they are called as sahibs.

00:15:24.903 --> 00:15:28.540
In India, if somebody tries to show too much style

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:31.341
or tries to show that he’s some class,

00:15:31.541 --> 00:15:34.540
“Ha! Now he’s become a sahib! He’s become a sahib!”

00:15:35.257 --> 00:15:38.603
Sahib means, it’s condemnation. In India it is condemnation.

00:15:38.803 --> 00:15:42.013
But that’s what it is. It’s come from English only,

00:15:42.213 --> 00:15:45.724
because English would talk like that; sometimes

00:15:45.925 --> 00:15:47.657
in such a manner that,

00:15:47.928 --> 00:15:50.626
even he might be just a butler somewhere,

00:15:50.826 --> 00:15:53.780
but he would talk with such a big airs about him.

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:56.185
But you are not that.

00:15:59.395 --> 00:16:00.835
And we have been thinking why,

00:16:01.035 --> 00:16:03.963
why is it, that the English cannot open their hearts?

00:16:04.163 --> 00:16:07.263
After all, you live on the heart of the whole universe!

00:16:08.518 --> 00:16:12.550
I mean, if you don’t open your hearts
who else is going to open their hearts?

00:16:14.441 --> 00:16:16.445
There’s no need to be vivacious, you see,

00:16:16.645 --> 00:16:19.843
talking like this, talking like that,
it’s not needed, I am not saying that,

00:16:20.043 --> 00:16:21.398
that, please understand.

00:16:21.598 --> 00:16:24.478
But I am saying, in a proper dignified manner,

00:16:24.678 --> 00:16:28.384
you have to laugh, you have to joke, you have to enjoy.

00:16:29.189 --> 00:16:32.624
Because there’s no joy inside that’s why it is so.

00:16:34.288 --> 00:16:36.460
Is it not? Or is there joy?

00:16:36.661 --> 00:16:40.397
And still you think, “If I laugh too much, what will people say?”

00:16:44.565 --> 00:16:48.092
So, this is one thing one has to understand: that all these artificialities

00:16:48.292 --> 00:16:51.635
are all stupid artificialities that were there.

00:16:52.439 --> 00:16:54.096
Like at the time

00:16:54.296 --> 00:16:56.470
you go to one of the queens parties

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:59.620
— I must tell you about it because I’ve been to all this nonsense

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:01.580
— and

00:17:02.148 --> 00:17:04.312
there are people who come in there,

00:17:04.512 --> 00:17:06.702
of course this Moss Bros. business again,

00:17:06.902 --> 00:17:09.545
they come in their tailcoats.

00:17:10.526 --> 00:17:12.053
And some get very

00:17:12.253 --> 00:17:15.500
tight ones and some get very loose ones, you see!

00:17:16.744 --> 00:17:19.900
The tight ones walk with such a funny gait, you don’t know

00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:22.015
what to do, you feel like laughing all the time

00:17:22.215 --> 00:17:23.740
and they look like jokers, I tell you.

00:17:23.941 --> 00:17:26.261
Very nice dignified people look like jokers.

00:17:26.461 --> 00:17:27.901
And the others who have

00:17:28.101 --> 00:17:30.865
loose ones walk like Charlie Chaplin.

00:17:33.118 --> 00:17:35.043
And I can never make them out,

00:17:35.243 --> 00:17:37.617
I tell you, I told CP, “Is he the same?”

00:17:37.817 --> 00:17:40.183
“Yes, he’s the same why?”, “I can’t make him out,

00:17:40.383 --> 00:17:43.134
he’s looking so different like Charlie Chaplin!”

00:17:43.658 --> 00:17:46.700
Might be, Charlie Chaplin might
have been to one of these such parties,

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:49.540
I am sure, the way he had his dress made.

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:52.460
Because this is absolutely there, I tell you.

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:55.433
And then, they must have the tea, sit down,

00:17:55.633 --> 00:17:57.720
this, that nonsense, you see.

00:17:59.631 --> 00:18:02.882
What I am saying that all this trickles down to us

00:18:03.082 --> 00:18:07.044
from a man-made nonsensical idea.

00:18:08.305 --> 00:18:09.980
We are sitting

00:18:10.548 --> 00:18:12.609
in the Kingdom of God.

00:18:17.045 --> 00:18:20.300
So we are not going to do all these things.

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:27.434
We are not going to indulge into all such nonsensical things,

00:18:27.635 --> 00:18:30.478
because it gives such an artificial superiority

00:18:30.678 --> 00:18:33.568
and cuts you off from the rest of the world.

00:18:39.052 --> 00:18:41.180
So I have to

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:43.177
really tell you that,

00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:47.489
in this whatever has happened that the

00:18:49.926 --> 00:18:52.420
kind of artificiality

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:54.337
that was built up,

00:18:56.561 --> 00:18:58.860
the reality had to give up.

00:18:59.686 --> 00:19:02.420
It couldn’t bear any more of that artificiality,

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:04.324
it was too much.

00:19:06.645 --> 00:19:08.460
Now I'm trying to find

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:13.560
out why this difference like I have seen Jeremy and Robert,

00:19:14.166 --> 00:19:16.780
they have become real Italians, I tell you.

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:20.323
So once, we had gone for shopping and then we said,

00:19:20.523 --> 00:19:23.830
“Let’s have some ice cream!”
Guido is very good at taking me to ice cream shops,

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:26.180
because I never eat otherwise!

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:29.803
So we were there and suddenly we heard a big laughter coming.

00:19:30.003 --> 00:19:32.870
I said, “Looks like some Sahaja Yogis coming this side.”

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:35.443
It was Baba Mama and these two

00:19:35.643 --> 00:19:38.582
coming down to the same shop,

00:19:39.164 --> 00:19:42.689
and laughing so loudly, that even the

00:19:46.742 --> 00:19:48.337
Italians were looking at them that,

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.073
“Who are these greater Italians who have come here?”

00:19:51.964 --> 00:19:54.340
Three of them laughing and laughing!

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:58.001
And they very quickly saw us and
they got a fright, because they were sitting.

00:19:58.201 --> 00:20:01.272
I said, “I am so happy to hear your laughter. All the way you came

00:20:01.472 --> 00:20:03.540
here and everybody was looking at you.”

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:06.722
Because both of them know Italian language,

00:20:06.923 --> 00:20:08.910
they know another language.

00:20:10.058 --> 00:20:11.903
There’s another thing with us is that we don’t

00:20:12.103 --> 00:20:14.748
want to learn any other language.

00:20:14.949 --> 00:20:18.318
Everyone will have to jolly well learn English language,

00:20:18.518 --> 00:20:21.206
otherwise we think they are all stupid fools.

00:20:21.607 --> 00:20:23.387
And we make fun of them.

00:20:23.587 --> 00:20:26.504
I have seen so many films here — they show so many

00:20:26.704 --> 00:20:29.539
little, little dramas sometimes some sort of series coming

00:20:29.739 --> 00:20:31.054
— where the show a French

00:20:31.254 --> 00:20:33.365
speaking English in a funny way,

00:20:33.565 --> 00:20:35.638
or a German speaking in a funny way.

00:20:35.838 --> 00:20:37.890
And also I think English can

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:40.220
speak in quite a funny way

00:20:41.241 --> 00:20:43.634
to me! Sometimes,

00:20:44.159 --> 00:20:45.904
it’s impossible.

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:49.464
Like today, the ticket collector I don’t know what language he spoke,

00:20:49.695 --> 00:20:53.293
but I didn’t understand what he
was talking, he was trying to be nice.

00:20:53.493 --> 00:20:55.558
But I was looking at him, I was about to ask him,

00:20:55.758 --> 00:20:58.820
“Now, what Oxford English, or is it Cambridge English?

00:20:59.146 --> 00:21:00.663
I don’t understand.”

00:21:00.863 --> 00:21:03.031
That’s how. So what I am saying

00:21:03.231 --> 00:21:05.740
that language is just for communication.

00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:08.703
But in the communication, if there’s no love,

00:21:08.903 --> 00:21:12.354
if there’s no genuineness, if there’s no feeling, concern,

00:21:12.555 --> 00:21:15.460
why do we want to communicate with anyone?

00:21:16.484 --> 00:21:18.480
Just a lip service,

00:21:19.144 --> 00:21:20.644
no good.

00:21:24.304 --> 00:21:27.256
So now we are not only

00:21:29.041 --> 00:21:30.541
part and parcel

00:21:30.742 --> 00:21:33.260
of this world but of the whole.

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:37.965
And everything circulates through you once you

00:21:38.591 --> 00:21:40.921
give up this insular feeling.

00:21:41.474 --> 00:21:43.955
But insulation is there, very much insulation,

00:21:44.156 --> 00:21:45.454
in the character, maybe because

00:21:45.654 --> 00:21:48.156
of England being an island.

00:21:49.161 --> 00:21:51.170
Except, as I was telling

00:21:51.371 --> 00:21:53.460
today to David, that except for

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:56.700
attacking other people and going into up to even China

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:59.900
up to Australia, otherwise they are insulated!

00:22:01.883 --> 00:22:04.253
So we must learn to watch ourselves,

00:22:04.453 --> 00:22:06.220
we must learn

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:11.259
what is coming to us from our forefathers.

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:13.740
This is the inheritance we have got!

00:22:16.711 --> 00:22:19.220
So suddenly we become lords,

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:22.100
suddenly we become ladies,

00:22:23.835 --> 00:22:26.028
suddenly we become some sort of an

00:22:26.228 --> 00:22:27.835
English duke.

00:22:29.018 --> 00:22:32.900
In India they made a lot of fun. You must
have seen the dukes nose they have got it,

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:34.754
given the name to

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:38.340
one projection of a mountain,

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:40.023
they call it, “This is a dukes nose,”

00:22:40.223 --> 00:22:43.491
because some duke must have gone with a nose like that.

00:22:48.258 --> 00:22:51.260
So we must learn to make fun of ourselves.

00:22:51.985 --> 00:22:54.220
Then all these things will disappear,

00:22:54.718 --> 00:22:56.180
and must understand that

00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:59.340
we are much higher people than this limited thing.

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:00.860
It’s no good.

00:23:02.355 --> 00:23:04.233
And if we are following these old people

00:23:04.433 --> 00:23:07.385
then we can become bhootish with
them, because they were quite bhoots,

00:23:07.585 --> 00:23:09.428
can see them, they were quite bhoots, the way

00:23:09.628 --> 00:23:11.260
they did certain things.

00:23:11.461 --> 00:23:12.910
And now they are dead and gone,

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:15.700
we are newly born, special people,

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:17.500
we are flowers

00:23:17.943 --> 00:23:19.843
and we should be fragrant.

00:23:21.238 --> 00:23:23.100
And this is what happened with Gavin is that

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:24.650
he’s gone down too much. And

00:23:24.851 --> 00:23:27.499
this Valerie is a character which is another horrible one.

00:23:27.699 --> 00:23:31.044
I just don’t know what to say about her — the less said the better.

00:23:31.496 --> 00:23:34.476
I mean I have never seen such a
person writing such a horrible thing,

00:23:34.676 --> 00:23:37.986
I have never heard that such books are written

00:23:38.186 --> 00:23:40.147
for general reading.

00:23:40.348 --> 00:23:43.100
I mean in India out of question!

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:46.116
Even one sentence like that wont be permitted.

00:23:47.217 --> 00:23:50.060
Something that’s nauseating, absolutely nauseating.

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:52.531
I couldn’t read of course, I am sorry to say but

00:23:52.732 --> 00:23:55.500
whatever I heard about it. And there were a few lines, they read it

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:58.952
and I said, “Baba! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! I don’t want to vomit!”

00:24:02.367 --> 00:24:05.780
So to just to have a style and this and that,

00:24:07.327 --> 00:24:09.619
it is not all right.

00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:12.220
We are the Spirit

00:24:12.543 --> 00:24:15.660
and the Spirit is the light,

00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:18.100
light all around us,

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:21.195
all around our auras.

00:24:21.395 --> 00:24:23.883
There are people walking with a special

00:24:24.443 --> 00:24:26.001
type of a personality,

00:24:26.201 --> 00:24:28.500
what do we need style for?

00:24:29.185 --> 00:24:31.883
Who has better style than ours?

00:24:33.646 --> 00:24:35.420
We make our own styles,

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:37.718
we are the makers of styles.

00:24:40.656 --> 00:24:43.883
So to conform to some sort of a nonsensical idea

00:24:44.084 --> 00:24:47.180
and to secede yourself,

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:49.700
to separate yourself, to cut yourself

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:52.447
from the collective, is nonsensical.

00:24:53.378 --> 00:24:57.124
Now this time, those who are going
to India, I have to tell you one thing:

00:24:57.987 --> 00:25:00.326
that you must get mixed up with people.

00:25:00.526 --> 00:25:02.855
We’ll not have any camp which will have

00:25:03.055 --> 00:25:05.193
only English or this.

00:25:05.393 --> 00:25:07.016
And it’s a very common failing,

00:25:07.216 --> 00:25:10.961
we must face it. It’s a very common failing.
Because now, I’m in England, so I’m also English,

00:25:11.161 --> 00:25:13.220
but I don’t have this failing in me.

00:25:13.546 --> 00:25:17.220
But I have seen Indians, when they live here, they become like this.

00:25:19.343 --> 00:25:21.005
I went to a place

00:25:21.205 --> 00:25:24.755
called Mar del Plata in Argentina.

00:25:24.956 --> 00:25:28.671
It’s a very beautiful place, very beautiful colony of people.

00:25:28.872 --> 00:25:30.761
So I said, “Who are these people living here?”

00:25:30.962 --> 00:25:32.163
They said; “All Spanish,

00:25:32.363 --> 00:25:35.178
Italians, this, that.” “And English?”,

00:25:35.378 --> 00:25:38.620
“No! English have a separate colony of theirs.”

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:41.020
But I wouldn’t be surprised tomorrow we have

00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:44.975
a separate colony of the English Indians;

00:25:45.372 --> 00:25:46.808
could be.

00:25:47.284 --> 00:25:49.310
They say in Sanskrit, “Sangati sanga doshena,”

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:51.743
means, if you live with somebody, you become like that.

00:25:51.944 --> 00:25:54.677
So we might have some dukes and duchesses in the

00:25:54.878 --> 00:25:58.487
Indian community also possibly tomorrow if they live here

00:26:00.034 --> 00:26:01.592
— quite possible.

00:26:01.944 --> 00:26:03.587
This is such a,

00:26:04.629 --> 00:26:06.319
such a

00:26:07.826 --> 00:26:10.340
atmosphere, charged,

00:26:11.541 --> 00:26:14.260
“We are something special.”

00:26:15.555 --> 00:26:19.252
And it shows so clearly when they do to another country,

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:21.420
it creates problems.

00:26:22.426 --> 00:26:24.412
They cannot mix up with people,

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:26.435
they cannot talk to others,

00:26:26.636 --> 00:26:28.060
all the time

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:32.260
they think they are like some media people, trying to criticise.

00:26:34.057 --> 00:26:37.299
The whole attitude is that

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:41.116
we have to get mixed up with the whole ocean of Sahaja Yogis.

00:26:42.585 --> 00:26:44.439
Instead of that, if you

00:26:44.663 --> 00:26:46.540
behave like that, people think they

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:48.660
are sort of

00:26:50.556 --> 00:26:52.340
criticising us.

00:26:55.365 --> 00:26:58.218
That’s why I have said many a times that we cannot use the word

00:26:58.418 --> 00:27:00.820
“I like” or “I believe”.

00:27:01.255 --> 00:27:03.340
No, not to use.

00:27:03.541 --> 00:27:05.105
Because that is how you despise others

00:27:05.305 --> 00:27:08.019
“I don’t like this, I don’t like that.”

00:27:08.219 --> 00:27:12.018
You may not even have half of this in the house, your own

00:27:12.592 --> 00:27:14.002
but they will say like that.

00:27:14.203 --> 00:27:17.226
You may not have food in the house to eat
but when they go to somebody’s house, they say,

00:27:17.427 --> 00:27:19.105
“I don’t like this food.”

00:27:20.086 --> 00:27:21.940
That we don’t have to have.

00:27:22.633 --> 00:27:26.633
All these things I have seen in him and that’s what I am telling you.

00:27:30.078 --> 00:27:33.420
Of course there are many books to read and we can.

00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:36.893
One good quality about English is that they are scholarly,

00:27:37.094 --> 00:27:39.380
they have scholarship. They read a lot, they know a lot.

00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:41.403
Ordinary person will also know.

00:27:41.603 --> 00:27:44.500
Also it being a very small country, they know about

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:46.980
little, little places. You go anywhere they know,

00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:49.260
“This glass is from Darlington,

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:50.740
this is from here,

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:53.619
that is from there.” Indians wouldn’t know anything!

00:27:54.451 --> 00:27:56.940
And if you ask them, “This sari comes from where?”

00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:59.171
Men, especially, women may tell you.

00:27:59.371 --> 00:28:01.734
Women will say, “I don’t know, must be from India

00:28:01.934 --> 00:28:04.434
is it? Or is it from Kenya?”

00:28:08.615 --> 00:28:11.251
They know about birds, about from where they come.

00:28:11.451 --> 00:28:12.958
But all these things, you see,

00:28:13.158 --> 00:28:15.754
this knowledge sometimes can make us

00:28:15.955 --> 00:28:17.825
over nationalistic:

00:28:18.026 --> 00:28:20.060
“We the British!”

00:28:20.504 --> 00:28:22.004
It can come.

00:28:22.429 --> 00:28:24.140
Be careful on that point,

00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:26.487
to say, “We are the British.”

00:28:27.011 --> 00:28:28.596
We are not!

00:28:29.043 --> 00:28:31.500
We are not Indians, we are not British, we are nothing.

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:33.020
We are gnostics.

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:36.403
We are the ones who know. We are Yogis.

00:28:39.338 --> 00:28:43.346
Because this is such an artificial ego in our head

00:28:43.546 --> 00:28:46.893
and that has made people hate us,

00:28:48.211 --> 00:28:51.311
while we are here to love the whole world.

00:28:56.007 --> 00:28:59.460
So our beauty lies in

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:02.220
how much we love others.

00:29:03.378 --> 00:29:06.771
We must face ourselves, see:

00:29:07.208 --> 00:29:09.540
“How much do we love,

00:29:10.739 --> 00:29:12.283
others?

00:29:13.037 --> 00:29:15.722
How much do we care for others?

00:29:17.204 --> 00:29:20.121
How much do we enjoy others?

00:29:21.649 --> 00:29:24.659
How do I feel when I face another Sahaja Yogi?”

00:29:25.314 --> 00:29:27.794
When I see you, a ripple

00:29:28.151 --> 00:29:31.179
of joy becomes like a thunder to me.

00:29:31.379 --> 00:29:33.015
I mean, I don’t know where I stand.

00:29:33.215 --> 00:29:36.820
And sometimes I feel I might just raise myself up in the heaven!

00:29:40.786 --> 00:29:44.420
That is the content within us of our Spirit.

00:29:45.035 --> 00:29:47.460
Not all these artificial things,

00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:49.540
they can never give us joy.

00:29:49.835 --> 00:29:52.135
They cannot give joy to anybody else.

00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:55.306
We have to be very simple people.

00:29:55.835 --> 00:29:58.500
Simple doesn’t mean that

00:29:59.131 --> 00:30:02.632
you should just wear some little few clothes, it doesn’t mean that.

00:30:02.945 --> 00:30:05.668
Simple, means from your heart.

00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:09.540
For small, small things you should feel happy.

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:12.420
Simple things should make you happy.

00:30:16.512 --> 00:30:18.540
And that is how

00:30:19.626 --> 00:30:22.106
we’ll get closer to each other.

00:30:22.854 --> 00:30:24.700
Because this world has to be one.

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:26.826
Now when it will be one Europe,

00:30:27.026 --> 00:30:29.820
what’s going happen to English I don’t know.

00:30:32.935 --> 00:30:36.180
They’ll have to jump in the sea I think because the way they will be

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:39.309
encroached by all these people because

00:30:42.567 --> 00:30:44.955
they are in a way,

00:30:45.155 --> 00:30:47.374
in an English way, they are aggressive people, because

00:30:47.574 --> 00:30:50.373
if an Italian is there, he’ll just walk into your house

00:30:50.573 --> 00:30:52.787
and say, “What have you got for today’s dinner?”

00:30:52.988 --> 00:30:55.700
Quite possible! And you say, “What’s this?

00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:59.193
It’s very unmannerly to walk in my house!”

00:31:00.445 --> 00:31:02.498
Why do you have a house?

00:31:02.698 --> 00:31:04.796
Even a rat cannot walk into that house.

00:31:04.997 --> 00:31:06.821
You polish your,

00:31:07.205 --> 00:31:09.003
brass, you

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:12.396
do all your cleanings, sweepings — for whom?

00:31:12.596 --> 00:31:14.278
There’s not even a rat

00:31:14.478 --> 00:31:16.940
in the house to come and see it.

00:31:19.149 --> 00:31:21.406
What’s the use of doing all this? Live like

00:31:21.606 --> 00:31:23.994
pigs then, better is that not to waste energy.

00:31:24.194 --> 00:31:25.702
Because there’s not even a,

00:31:26.194 --> 00:31:28.900
even a pig to come and see you!

00:31:32.632 --> 00:31:34.217
All right the climate is such,

00:31:34.417 --> 00:31:36.660
we can’t leave the doors open, all right,

00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:38.740
but hearts can be open.

00:31:41.511 --> 00:31:44.660
I have had lots of experiences of this myself.

00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:46.598
But in Sahaja Yoga, if it crawls up,

00:31:46.798 --> 00:31:49.500
then I don’t think our Sahaja Yoga can prosper,

00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:51.977
or people can have that content.

00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:54.643
The quality of Sahaja Yoga should be within us:

00:31:54.843 --> 00:31:57.034
how many people we give Realisation?

00:31:57.234 --> 00:31:58.947
How many people we can talk to?

00:31:59.147 --> 00:32:01.492
How much do we know about Sahaja Yoga?

00:32:03.042 --> 00:32:05.146
How much we have mastered it,

00:32:05.356 --> 00:32:07.137
how many people

00:32:08.314 --> 00:32:10.220
we get into Sahaja Yoga?

00:32:11.015 --> 00:32:12.600
Can we?

00:32:17.037 --> 00:32:19.752
It’s the circulation of the heart

00:32:20.673 --> 00:32:22.179
that is important.

00:32:22.379 --> 00:32:26.297
And if you cannot circulate why are you living on the heart?

00:32:27.244 --> 00:32:28.904
This is the

00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:30.643
country of heart

00:32:30.844 --> 00:32:32.300
where Shiva lives,

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:35.317
where He is pulsating in everything

00:32:35.517 --> 00:32:37.275
— is pulsating in everything

00:32:37.476 --> 00:32:39.638
— and there where you are there,

00:32:39.839 --> 00:32:41.939
then what you should do?

00:32:49.413 --> 00:32:50.980
Circulation:

00:32:51.361 --> 00:32:53.420
how much you can circulate,

00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:55.660
articulate with people,

00:32:56.658 --> 00:32:58.274
rapport,

00:32:58.742 --> 00:33:02.352
understanding. Everywhere there’s joy,

00:33:02.553 --> 00:33:06.271
everywhere there’s understanding. Such

00:33:07.888 --> 00:33:12.032
oceans of depths people have

00:33:12.233 --> 00:33:14.758
but we must know how to penetrate into them.

00:33:14.958 --> 00:33:18.515
But if you want to have the pearls, you have to dive down.

00:33:18.715 --> 00:33:21.766
But if you want to live with the straw it is hanging there

00:33:21.967 --> 00:33:25.038
on the surface — live with it!

00:33:27.858 --> 00:33:31.420
We have come to Sahaja Yoga to become great people.

00:33:32.707 --> 00:33:35.260
We have been British, all right finished now, done!

00:33:35.461 --> 00:33:37.279
But now we had a second birth,

00:33:37.479 --> 00:33:39.493
we have entered into the Kingdom of God,

00:33:39.693 --> 00:33:42.060
now we are here to become great people,

00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:44.060
great monarchs.

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:48.500
And these styles and all this have come

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:51.191
from the so-called monarchs and kings

00:33:51.391 --> 00:33:53.651
and horrible people they were! Do you know that?

00:33:53.852 --> 00:33:56.695
They told me that Queen Elizabeth,

00:33:56.930 --> 00:33:59.992
the first one, had a kind of a funny patch here,

00:34:00.192 --> 00:34:03.690
they don’t know if she was a man or a woman, or whatever it is,

00:34:03.891 --> 00:34:06.500
whatever she was, man or a woman, or a person,

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:08.940
this was the thing, she had a patch here.

00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:11.230
That’s why she made this

00:34:11.431 --> 00:34:12.980
kind of a collar

00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:15.220
for her which was standing here.

00:34:16.652 --> 00:34:18.740
And everybody had to wear that!

00:34:21.636 --> 00:34:23.537
And they said about Victoria also

00:34:23.738 --> 00:34:26.820
I don’t want to say anything against
her because I have great respect for her

00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:29.323
but they say she developed a hump on the back so she

00:34:29.523 --> 00:34:32.898
developed these Victorian skirts.

00:34:36.381 --> 00:34:40.293
So also you can see that hippyism started in England,

00:34:40.934 --> 00:34:43.300
punkism started in England.

00:34:44.907 --> 00:34:47.749
Imagine the punks! They are mad!

00:34:49.165 --> 00:34:51.336
And when I went to an

00:34:51.971 --> 00:34:54.556
exhibition in a

00:34:55.898 --> 00:34:57.329
Rome,

00:34:57.529 --> 00:34:59.523
beautiful exhibition it was,

00:34:59.723 --> 00:35:03.723
we were passing from one country
to another country, to another country,

00:35:04.737 --> 00:35:06.237
and there,

00:35:06.681 --> 00:35:09.573
I thought of England, because I
have become English as I told you.

00:35:09.773 --> 00:35:11.573
He said, “Where is UK?” He said, “It’s there!”

00:35:11.781 --> 00:35:14.221
And there were about six, seven

00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:15.910
boys from,

00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:19.664
mostly from Italy, and three, four girls laughing, “Ha! Ha!”

00:35:19.865 --> 00:35:23.389
I said, “What’s happening there? What’s the matter?

00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:27.005
Why are they laughing at the English,
when the English laugh at everyone?”

00:35:27.441 --> 00:35:30.141
And you know what was that? It was a punk shop

00:35:30.341 --> 00:35:33.841
— that’s the only thing they had for exhibition, believe me.

00:35:34.518 --> 00:35:36.300
Holey pants,

00:35:36.829 --> 00:35:39.100
holey, H O L E Y !

00:35:41.567 --> 00:35:44.788
Holey pants and they had these

00:35:45.482 --> 00:35:46.986
— what you call them,

00:35:47.735 --> 00:35:49.260
what do you call I don’t know that?

00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:51.140
We call toora in Hindi language

00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:54.980
that kind of thing — and all that, they were selling there.

00:35:56.931 --> 00:35:59.624
And they said, “It’s all genuine, genuine,

00:35:59.975 --> 00:36:01.980
genuine from England.”

00:36:03.033 --> 00:36:05.918
And all of these Italians were laughing.

00:36:06.119 --> 00:36:09.740
So I asked Flavia, “Why are they laughing at these British?”

00:36:10.012 --> 00:36:13.130
He said, “Mother, we have a sense of ridicule,

00:36:13.411 --> 00:36:15.540
we have a great sense of ridicule.”

00:36:16.304 --> 00:36:18.780
While these people were thinking, “So what?

00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:22.180
What’s wrong? If I cut my nose what’s wrong?”

00:36:23.928 --> 00:36:25.980
So ultimately we end up into this

00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:27.940
kind of a stupidity, as you know,

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:31.780
that a person who has this kind of an ego becomes an idiot.

00:36:38.128 --> 00:36:42.071
And there are many things which you can see clearly how,

00:36:42.272 --> 00:36:44.995
how we thought that we were something great

00:36:45.195 --> 00:36:47.580
and how people befooled us.

00:36:48.437 --> 00:36:50.180
There’s a great writer in

00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:52.340
Hindi language called as Premchand.

00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:54.820
I must tell you his story it’s very interesting.

00:36:55.373 --> 00:36:57.340
We had English in India and we knew

00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:00.540
how to befool them, I must tell you, frankly.

00:37:01.921 --> 00:37:04.020
And there were two Englishmen

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:06.340
going in a Benares street.

00:37:07.408 --> 00:37:11.060
And mostly in Benares, they have their WCs on top in the open.

00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:14.260
They sit there. And they had a,

00:37:14.733 --> 00:37:16.780
- we carry our

00:37:17.208 --> 00:37:20.108
jar, lota, they call it lota

00:37:21.004 --> 00:37:22.466
with the water.

00:37:22.667 --> 00:37:24.945
Somebody put the lota there,

00:37:25.146 --> 00:37:28.580
and suddenly, with some sort of a thing, it fell down.

00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:30.864
And it just fell down

00:37:31.434 --> 00:37:33.366
— are you recording me?

00:37:33.567 --> 00:37:36.140
Hello? Now don’t record this.

00:37:36.825 --> 00:37:38.700
You want to record it?

00:37:40.042 --> 00:37:41.852
Only for English all right.

00:37:42.052 --> 00:37:44.252
But don’t give it to anybody else!

00:37:46.226 --> 00:37:49.818
So the lota fell down and fell down.

00:37:50.019 --> 00:37:53.334
And he describes, “Fell on the feet

00:37:53.725 --> 00:37:55.494
of those where many

00:37:55.694 --> 00:37:58.323
Indians go and put there heads.”

00:37:58.523 --> 00:37:59.938
So I said, “What that must be?”

00:38:00.138 --> 00:38:02.819
They were the feet of two Englishmen.

00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:05.069
And then the Englishmen got angry,

00:38:05.269 --> 00:38:08.940
because according to their country’s law nothing can be hurt.

00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:12.420
And they took the lota they said,
“We are taking you to the police now.

00:38:12.621 --> 00:38:15.048
This has hurt us so much!”

00:38:16.061 --> 00:38:17.860
So, you see,

00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:20.533
the man who was upstairs came running,

00:38:20.733 --> 00:38:22.845
said, “Sorry, sorry!” He said, “Nothing doing,

00:38:23.045 --> 00:38:26.117
we are going to take you to the police! It has hurt us.

00:38:26.318 --> 00:38:29.660
You had no business to keep a lota there that it fell on our feet.”

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:31.580
In India, nobody compensates.

00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:33.567
But if an Englishman comes and says, all right,

00:38:33.767 --> 00:38:36.154
they’ll say, “Baba, it’s all right, what to do?”

00:38:37.359 --> 00:38:40.672
So there was one fellow who thought of a trick.

00:38:42.587 --> 00:38:45.793
So he knew English. He said, “See,

00:38:45.994 --> 00:38:49.420
you can take them to police.
At most police will fine them a little bit.

00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:52.083
But do you know this lota?” He said, “What?”

00:38:52.283 --> 00:38:55.145
“This lota belonged to Akbar.

00:38:55.346 --> 00:38:58.131
Akbar used to carry this lota with him,

00:38:58.332 --> 00:39:02.197
so instead of taking them if you ask for this lota

00:39:02.397 --> 00:39:05.291
will be a good idea its an antique piece you see.

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:08.083
Will be good for you

00:39:08.283 --> 00:39:10.935
Akbar the great used to take this!”

00:39:11.656 --> 00:39:13.863
And he told in Hindi language to them that,

00:39:14.064 --> 00:39:15.610
“I have befooled them and I have told then

00:39:15.810 --> 00:39:17.540
this belonged to Akbar and you just say

00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:20.891
that ‘We don’t want to give this lota and you can take us to police!’

00:39:21.448 --> 00:39:23.795
So they said, “Now, all right.

00:39:23.995 --> 00:39:27.131
If you give us this lota, then we’ll forgive you!”

00:39:27.332 --> 00:39:30.251
So these people said, “No we don’t want to give this lota.”

00:39:30.451 --> 00:39:33.190
“Why?” “Because it belonged to Akbar!

00:39:33.877 --> 00:39:37.058
How can we give such a lota? He was our forefather.

00:39:37.258 --> 00:39:39.580
We can’t give our lota to you!”

00:39:40.124 --> 00:39:42.791
So then the English said, “All right,

00:39:43.007 --> 00:39:45.941
then are you willing to come to police?”
“Yes, yes, we are willing to come to police

00:39:46.141 --> 00:39:47.700
but we can’t give you this lota!”

00:39:47.901 --> 00:39:51.620
So they paid lot of money for that lota and bought it.

00:39:58.476 --> 00:40:01.016
And they were very proud, you see.

00:40:01.727 --> 00:40:04.647
And they took that lota and they must have put it in some frame

00:40:04.847 --> 00:40:08.847
to say that this is was the lota which was carried by Akbar.

00:40:09.605 --> 00:40:11.393
So this is how it is.

00:40:12.221 --> 00:40:14.809
So first we must have respect for

00:40:15.010 --> 00:40:18.090
other cultures, other things and other people

00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:19.948
and other countries and try to

00:40:20.148 --> 00:40:22.760
see what they have good about them.

00:40:23.964 --> 00:40:26.831
Otherwise nothing will penetrate into you

00:40:27.788 --> 00:40:30.411
and you will be left high and dry all your life.

00:40:30.612 --> 00:40:33.386
There’s so many nice things in this world.

00:40:34.455 --> 00:40:37.180
Say you go to Italy — see the beautiful

00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:39.500
work they do, the furniture they make,

00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:41.811
things they make. Once they come to

00:40:42.011 --> 00:40:44.631
England I don’t know what’s going to happen to us.

00:40:44.839 --> 00:40:47.777
We had lots of beautiful

00:40:48.036 --> 00:40:52.036
art and we had talents, but all finished now, nobody is having that.

00:40:52.675 --> 00:40:55.102
And when they come here what is going to happen?

00:40:55.303 --> 00:40:57.740
In machinery, when the Germans come here,

00:40:58.082 --> 00:40:59.768
they’ll finish us off.

00:41:02.099 --> 00:41:05.481
So we have to realise that these outside things and

00:41:05.682 --> 00:41:08.528
thinking that we are something great, is not greatness.

00:41:08.728 --> 00:41:12.460
Greatness is within yourself, within your heart.

00:41:16.754 --> 00:41:18.620
And it is so much,

00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:22.193
so much evident, so much evident here,

00:41:22.394 --> 00:41:24.780
that it’s really shocking.

00:41:29.650 --> 00:41:31.180
As a reaction to all that

00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:34.100
formalities and all that, people might have taken to

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:37.053
very casual dresses, all right.

00:41:37.253 --> 00:41:41.019
But that’s not the way, because from inside it has to go.

00:41:41.951 --> 00:41:43.728
All these ideas have to

00:41:43.928 --> 00:41:47.207
be washed off completely, cleaned off.

00:41:48.278 --> 00:41:49.780
And we have to know that

00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:52.540
we are the ones, we have to give light of the Spirit

00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:54.460
to the whole world.

00:41:55.807 --> 00:41:57.511
And how can we cover and

00:41:57.711 --> 00:42:00.447
cloud ourselves with all these funny ideas?

00:42:01.136 --> 00:42:05.060
And that’s why so many of you,
you have asked me questions about Gavin.

00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:07.340
Only thing I have to say that,

00:42:07.844 --> 00:42:10.660
to this extent, only an Englishman can go

00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:12.980
because he can forgive himself.

00:42:13.914 --> 00:42:16.343
To this extent nobody else can go.

00:42:16.615 --> 00:42:20.227
Nobody has done like this. No one has done like this.

00:42:20.428 --> 00:42:24.031
We had so many people removed
from Sahaja Yoga, you know that very well.

00:42:24.232 --> 00:42:28.083
But the way he has gone down and the way he was with us for the

00:42:28.283 --> 00:42:30.507
last fourteen years, it’s surprising.

00:42:30.707 --> 00:42:32.580
And I understand that people ask me

00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:34.663
questions, I understand why it is happening.

00:42:34.812 --> 00:42:36.380
But be careful now!

00:42:37.862 --> 00:42:39.993
Let us not be

00:42:40.193 --> 00:42:43.993
lost with these foolish stupid ideas we had.

00:42:45.487 --> 00:42:47.356
And let us be something great.

00:42:47.556 --> 00:42:51.067
Let us be within ourselves, see for ourselves.

00:42:51.267 --> 00:42:53.571
No amount of arrogance,

00:42:53.771 --> 00:42:56.100
no amount of artificiality

00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:59.020
is going to give us any special personality,

00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:02.140
except that we realise what we are.

00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:04.380
And when we know what we are,

00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:07.363
we enjoy ourselves, we never get bored,

00:43:07.563 --> 00:43:09.580
we enjoy ourselves

00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:11.570
— never get bored.

00:43:14.219 --> 00:43:18.219
So at the beginning of the programme I have to say that

00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:21.620
I have seen the Sahaja Yogis if they want to be good they can be

00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:23.936
really very good people,

00:43:24.137 --> 00:43:27.340
in England, because the quality

00:43:28.322 --> 00:43:31.820
of intelligence is much better,

00:43:32.177 --> 00:43:35.620
perhaps, also their scholarship is very good.

00:43:36.614 --> 00:43:39.102
But when they fall,

00:43:39.302 --> 00:43:41.947
they fall also very fast

00:43:42.736 --> 00:43:45.300
and go down very much.

00:43:46.267 --> 00:43:48.294
So on what we have to depend

00:43:48.494 --> 00:43:51.385
is to our step

00:43:51.585 --> 00:43:55.493
where we are standing and what step we are going to take further.

00:43:55.694 --> 00:43:57.691
For example meditating:

00:43:57.891 --> 00:44:01.608
Dr. Brian Wells told me that people don’t want to meditate

00:44:01.809 --> 00:44:03.388
in the ashram.

00:44:03.668 --> 00:44:07.668
Now meditation is very important, is the only way we can grow.

00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:11.585
Now all right, people used to get up,

00:44:11.785 --> 00:44:13.341
say about ten o’clock before.

00:44:13.542 --> 00:44:15.054
But do you don’t get drunk,

00:44:15.254 --> 00:44:17.415
why should you get up at ten o’clock?

00:44:18.055 --> 00:44:21.928
You have to get up in the morning. You have to look after yourself:

00:44:22.128 --> 00:44:24.868
means you have to look after your Spirit!

00:44:25.743 --> 00:44:28.500
And that’s what we have to achieve.

00:44:29.006 --> 00:44:32.140
And I know if you all decide you can do it very well.

00:44:32.568 --> 00:44:34.620
Among yourselves

00:44:36.308 --> 00:44:39.140
is better understanding

00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:42.420
but when it comes to others

00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:44.940
it seems there’s some sort of a

00:44:46.023 --> 00:44:47.842
communication gap

00:44:49.402 --> 00:44:51.002
which should not be.

00:44:51.392 --> 00:44:54.900
If the Germans could be that gentle and so sweet.

00:44:55.102 --> 00:44:56.835
You’ve seen the German people

00:44:57.036 --> 00:44:58.653
who are Sahaj Yogis

00:44:58.853 --> 00:45:00.777
— even to touch a flower

00:45:00.977 --> 00:45:04.977
is easier than to touch a German I
tell you they have become so gentle,

00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:07.140
because they have learnt a lesson.

00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:10.420
And I asked a German, “What’s the matter with English?

00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:12.420
Why haven’t they learnt a lesson?”

00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:14.362
He answered me back,

00:45:14.562 --> 00:45:16.820
which is a very important thing to know,

00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:19.340
“They have never lost a war Mother.

00:45:20.002 --> 00:45:23.202
They have to lose one war, they’ll be all right.”

00:45:32.081 --> 00:45:35.460
So the gentleness,

00:45:36.028 --> 00:45:37.765
which is not outward,

00:45:37.965 --> 00:45:40.540
which is not just a lip service,

00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:43.060
but from within:

00:45:43.261 --> 00:45:45.472
“How can they hurt someone?”

00:45:48.414 --> 00:45:50.902
I mean, I had to put myself into

00:45:51.102 --> 00:45:53.691
a frame of mind to talk to you like this.

00:45:54.009 --> 00:45:57.379
And I didn’t know how many flowers I should

00:45:57.580 --> 00:46:01.580
weave round my words so that it should not hurt you.

00:46:06.678 --> 00:46:08.580
And even then, you see,

00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:11.285
the back of my mind, there’s a kind of a sadness,

00:46:11.485 --> 00:46:13.504
because I love you so much

00:46:13.705 --> 00:46:17.705
and it shows that I have stayed with you the most of the time.

00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:20.446
You are specially privileged.

00:46:20.646 --> 00:46:22.350
But that should give you

00:46:22.585 --> 00:46:24.282
greater humility.

00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:26.261
Because whatever are my qualities

00:46:26.461 --> 00:46:28.314
they should be much more in you

00:46:28.514 --> 00:46:31.485
and be shown to people that they
should, “Oh, English, we can make out,

00:46:31.685 --> 00:46:33.940
they’re like Mother to look at.

00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:37.220
They are like Mother to behave. They are just like Mother.”

00:46:37.593 --> 00:46:39.340
Let me hear that.

00:46:41.388 --> 00:46:44.075
All right? So it’s a promise to me

00:46:44.276 --> 00:46:47.060
— is it all right? — on an Ashtami day.

00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:48.911
Let us finish all these negativities

00:46:49.111 --> 00:46:53.020
and let us become that special type of people

00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:56.279
- who are worshipped all over. - All right?

00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:58.080
May God Bless You.
