00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.619
Today is the birthday of Adi Guru Nanaka,

00:00:08.862 --> 00:00:15.635
and it is being celebrated through-out the world

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.709
surprisingly with a zeal that I have not seen before in India.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.559
First time, it was announced in many newspapers and a lot was done.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.639
Guru Nanaka only spoke about Sahaja Yoga,

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:33.754
and said that everything else is just a superficial display.

00:00:33.955 --> 00:00:38.340
About religion He said that observing fasts, going on pilgrimage,

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.889
going here and there, all are meant just to show off.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.109
Now you need to find the (Spirit/the power) within you

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.619
and establish it inside yourself.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.690
Again and again he kept saying this.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.999
He did not say any other thing,

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.469
even to the extent that He did not talk of any rituals.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.069
But when after Him, Guru Teg Bahadur became the guru -

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.749
I think today is His martyr's day?

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.159
SY: Tomorrow.
SM: Tomorrow, tomorrow is his martyr's day.

00:01:10.367 --> 00:01:13.999
He was also of the same opinion,

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.459
but the person who was the last guru,

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.569
because war was being fought, he created rituals.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.844
So he prescribed Kada (iron bangle) to be worn,

00:01:25.045 --> 00:01:28.039
not to cut their hair. All these were prescribed by him.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.940
All these were imposed by him.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.349
But Guru Nanaka only talked about the Spirit.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.179
Everything else is of no value, He explained it very clearly.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.529
But no one reads what He wrote, what to do?

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.050
They will just put a finger on the verset in the book,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.824
move it along the line, recite it and then go to the next verset.

00:01:45.025 --> 00:01:46.777
Can anyone understand it in this way?

00:01:46.978 --> 00:01:50.749
If we go through His writings properly and absorb them,

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.509
then the whole confusion from Shabad-Jala (web of words) will end.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.789
But most people are still caught in that.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.299
And in that confusion see the condition of Sikhs!

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.349
They have no desire to look inside, which they should have.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.527
If there is no inner search, how could one follow Sikh dharma?

00:02:09.728 --> 00:02:11.829
This is His actual teaching.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.160
His teachings are called "sikhi" (path of learning),

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.459
meaning "I have written this for you to read and learn".

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.681
And all the big saints who came at that time,

00:02:21.882 --> 00:02:23.361
and afterwards as well said the same thing.

00:02:23.562 --> 00:02:27.709
Big saints were born and He knew who was a saint and who was not.

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.092
He included all their poems and experiences in His book.

00:02:33.293 --> 00:02:35.820
That is why the Granth Sahib is worthy of worship,

00:02:35.987 --> 00:02:37.684
because such people

00:02:37.885 --> 00:02:45.467
who were recognized and followed as great gurus at that time

00:02:45.668 --> 00:02:48.560
who had done great work and were spiritual,

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.429
all their work was consolidated and put into Guru Granth Sahib.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.440
That is what we do in Sahaja Yoga as well.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.169
We do not follow any particular saint; we respect them and merge their teachings.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.060
This is what He did at that time.

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.690
But whatever He said and wrote, was lost in words,

00:03:07.891 --> 00:03:09.761
beacause people did not go beyond the words.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.678
That is why Kabira wrote: "By reading too much, the pandits became foolish".

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:18.781
It is that only. They have become fools.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.159
Now there is no fight or anything else

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.449
so what is the need to wear a turban?

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.869
Or what is the need to be conditioned to have "Kachhehra" (underware)

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.460
or to carry a comb all the time?

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.909
They do all these things as told but they drink alcohol.

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.829
They have no problem in drinking, though their guru forbade alcohol.

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.919
One who talks of self-consciousness could never support alcohol.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.869
They drink alcohol but are very particular about these other things,

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.899
like wear a turban or doing one thing or another.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.489
They want to create a clan and live in that clan.

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.660
And by doing all these outward things,

00:04:04.846 --> 00:04:07.909
they pay less attention to the inner ones which were preached.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.510
Like that they have continued - I don't know how,

00:04:11.711 --> 00:04:14.521
they have taken to this kind of ritualism

00:04:14.701 --> 00:04:16.959
and became completely outside oriented people.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.690
Their attention is outside so they perceive only the outside view.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.620
Now to turn these people towards Sahaja Yoga should not be difficult

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.400
as we are already doing all the things mentioned by Him.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.369
They have not done these things and we are doing them - it is the only difference.

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.929
They talked of achieving “Sahaja Samadhi”, but how?

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.619
He has also said that it will be done by the Kundalini.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.689
But who would raise the Kundalini?

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.959
Guru Nanak did not give Realization to anybody, as far as I know.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.730
He had only two disciples.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.099
He gave Realization only to these two disciples.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.090
If one person gives realization to only two of his disciples,

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.289
what effect will that have?

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.410
But people took only His outside things and went on.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.680
They built big, big things,

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:09.059
you can see all over so many temples and so on.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:10.840
What is the benefit in that?

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.010
But they built few evolved people only

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.209
and the remaining is just a race of Sikhs.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.920
How to explain this to them?

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.130
But now I have seen that they have started coming to Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:29.297
At least 8-10 Sikh people have come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.239
I recognize them as they wear turbans, but maybe some are without.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.509
One branch of Sikhs are the Namdhari. They believe in Me.

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.739
Many of them are in Bangkok.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.640
Maybe fifty or sixty came to the programme, wearing white turbans.

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:51.469
So I do not know what is their speciality,

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:56.340
but they follow what Guru Nanak had said.

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.315
Like that diversions keep on coming in religion

00:06:00.516 --> 00:06:02.130
but what have they achieved like this?

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.867
They are fighting with each other. What is the use?

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:14.050
While Guru Nanak said that He is a "pir" (saint) for the Muslims

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:19.749
and a guru for the hindus,

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:21.465
and their "pir" (saint)…

00:06:21.666 --> 00:06:26.681
None will understand this unless they are realized.

00:06:26.882 --> 00:06:32.423
But this was necessary to happen to prepare us.

00:06:32.624 --> 00:06:34.670
All of the gurus have helped in preparing you.

00:06:34.859 --> 00:06:39.859
In the end our duty is to follow what they have said.

00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:43.690
But the condition of all the gurus' teachings became the same

00:06:43.891 --> 00:06:47.949
and many seekers were lost, no one knows where!

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:52.629
I was talking about Gyan Deva (Gyaneshwara), how great He became.

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:56.703
He belonged to the Nath-Panth order and He wrote about Kundalini.

00:06:56.904 --> 00:07:01.359
But His disciples used to call themselves "varkaris" (pilgrims).

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.180
Nowadays they make a show out of it,

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:08.779
carrying heavy bronze cymbals, weighing 1kg total,

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:12.677
beating them all the way to the temple Pandhari Nath in Pandharpur.

00:07:12.878 --> 00:07:16.372
And the clothes they wear are called "lattar",

00:07:16.573 --> 00:07:18.981
made up of jute and all torn.

00:07:19.182 --> 00:07:20.955
They consider it a big sacrifice,

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.820
beating the cymbals during their month long pilgrimage.

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.169
And they keep on chewing tobacco all the way.

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:29.056
Such are the "varkaris".

00:07:29.257 --> 00:07:33.359
And then they created their own religious sect.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:37.745
What is the speciality of this sect?

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:41.960
They take out a procession with a palanquin for Gyan Deva,

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.300
who did not even have shoes to wear,

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:48.918
but they carry His padukas from village to village in the palanquin.

00:07:49.119 --> 00:07:53.329
They take the palanquin through 25 villages and demand food there.

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:56.380
They go from village to village and eat food everywhere.

00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:59.739
This is a new method of begging,

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:03.419
these type of things are just another way of begging.

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:08.377
Thirdly, He was born in Alandi, near Pune.

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:14.390
Later he went to Niwase, but He was born here.

00:08:14.591 --> 00:08:22.459
Women there take earthen flower pots with tulsi growing in it,

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:27.049
completely filled with soil weighing at least 3-4 kg,

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:30.950
and carry them on their heads all the way to Alandi.

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:34.849
I have seen it with My own eyes. I do not understand why they do it.

00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:41.956
And so many people have earned so much money using His name.

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:47.709
How do people believe in someone taking a guru's name to make money?

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:52.480
And because of this all His work got finished.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:58.759
Not only that, one fellow gives big lectures on Gyan Deva

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:02.219
and earns a lot of money just by giving lectures,

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:04.879
but he speaks whatever he feels like

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.149
and people keep on listening to him.

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:10.029
People are filled with this type of blind faith.

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:13.089
The same thing happened to Shri Guru Nanak.

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:18.019
I notice that no one actually knows what He said and did not say.

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:20.510
To this extent that they made a city called Chandigarh,

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:23.430
while He was referring about My coming as Chandi (Devi).

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:27.330
He has described everything - nobody even sees that.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.640
The same way all gurus end up.

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:36.410
But now, to those who are realised it will not happen,

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:41.049
because now that you have got the truth you cannot accept falsehood.

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:44.879
And anything false emerges then it will be finished.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.750
So many people have got Realization around the world

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:50.159
that now no one can spread a lie.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.759
Everything that I have said is taped and recorded

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.910
so nobody can alter that.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:58.239
That is why I did not write a book,

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.979
because you have to listen to the tapes,

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:04.560
but a book you can keep on reading but without understanding it.

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:08.479
Just staring in the books...that is why I thought its better I write less.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:12.209
The more you listen to the tapes

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:14.920
the better it will register in your brain.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.949
Otherwise just by reading you get only entertainment.

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:19.800
What is the use?

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.779
Let's see what becomes of Sahaja Yoga in the future.

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:27.010
I don't know but things can go wrong.

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:29.570
But as Sahaja Yogis have reached a level,

00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:31.800
I believe they cannot go astray.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.169
You should not do wrong things.

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:37.639
This is one thing you have to learn from His life,

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:41.229
from what Guru Nanak said, He wrote book after book.

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:43.479
If you read the Guru Vani (words of the Guru),

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.779
it says only that: "Know thy Self, recognize your Self".

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:49.489
But what are the people doing?

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:52.090
But this will not happen in Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:56.529
Now I have established everybody so they cannot change back now.

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:59.010
Even if they want, it cannot happen now.

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:01.030
Whatever had to happen has happened.

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:03.619
Despite all the disrespect,

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:09.589
all the troubles and adversities Guru Nanak faced, He did so much.

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:13.079
But He did not give Realization as I was telling you earlier.

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:16.939
He did not give Realization, so people did not experience it.

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:21.449
Now you can say what you want, say what you may,

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:25.659
by taking anyone's name from the scripture you will not change.

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:28.249
It will happen only though Realization.

00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:31.560
This is one lesson we should take from Him

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:34.179
that we should not go on the wrong path

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:37.410
or hold other beliefs. This is very important.

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:39.930
We are Sahaja Yogis,

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:43.699
we understand Sahaja Yoga so proficiently and deeply,

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:46.390
so there is no need to come up with something new from it.

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:50.029
Even now there are one or two people who say: "Do this, do that".

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:52.270
This is all useless talk.

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:56.749
How should I say this? In a way...

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:04.929
...their behaviour is completely false. There is no truth in it.

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:08.479
Like: "Keep the water this side. Keep something else there".

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:11.609
I have never said anything like this.

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:14.080
Those things I have never said, they are doing.

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.654
But now if they hear My speeches with their ears

00:12:16.855 --> 00:12:19.520
they will understand as from the ears it will go in their brain.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:23.750
They will not learn the true meaning by reading, but by listening.

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:27.061
Why do you do things I have not said?

00:12:27.262 --> 00:12:31.229
It is because of old conditionings. It happens because of that also.

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:36.169
You move ahead with old conditionings developed since your birth.

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:38.210
Until these conditionings are dropped,

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:40.829
the true form of Sahaja Yoga cannot manifest.

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:44.429
And I have made you special. You are special people;

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:50.579
special because you know dharma, you know everything.

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:53.280
you know about yourself, you know about others,

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:56.219
you can give Realization, you understand everything,

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:58.799
so you are fully accomplished (sampoorna).

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.410
So after this why should you go astray? There is no reason for it.

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:08.120
We should also reflect to how hard Guru Nanak worked

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.110
and how much He had to endure.

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.039
His wife was also not good and gave Him lot of trouble.

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:17.707
And what is the state today of what He created from His hard work?

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:23.060
Same about Jesus Christ, about Mohamed Sahib and all the others.

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:26.260
Guru Nanak's work was distorted the most

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:29.229
even though He was one of the last Gurus who came.

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:32.800
He explained a lot, did everything.

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:36.969
After Him, Shri Sainath came

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:40.679
who said there is no need to follow rituals, they are all useless.

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:44.319
He said clearly that if one starts anything,

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:46.630
people will spoil it,

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:49.879
because they are not awakened.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:54.089
It's different after Realization - all become one, all become wise.

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:57.619
Without Realization it's a very difficult task.

00:13:57.820 --> 00:13:59.480
So He did not do any of that,

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:02.959
He did not organize people or anything else,

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:06.099
He had His disciples and that's it.

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:08.429
And even I have not organized anything.

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:10.840
Even though we don't have an organization,

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:14.179
after Realization people become organized on their own.

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:18.559
Like in the human body all the organs get organized automatically.

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:23.229
Just like that - there is no separate organization or anything else.

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:26.330
Everything works on its own.

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:37.509
My eternal blessings to you all.

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:40.069
And you need to take care

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:44.097
that what you have received you should not distort.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.360
There can be no bigger sin than that.

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:50.658
And we should not distort it for any reason.

00:14:50.859 --> 00:14:53.540
We should not allow distortion to come.

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:57.080
Eternal blessings to you all.
