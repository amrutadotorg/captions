00:02.970 --> 00:08.060
Today is the birthday of Guru Nanaka.

00:11.480 --> 00:15.410
It is being celebrated through-out the world

00:15.410 --> 00:19.720
with so much of zeal that I have not seen in India.

00:19.770 --> 00:23.760
For the first time it has been advertised in so many papers and by different means.

00:23.760 --> 00:25.980
Guru Nanaka always talked of Sahaja Yoga.

00:25.980 --> 00:33.720
Everything else, He said, is just showing off.

00:33.720 --> 00:38.470
About religion He said that observing fasts, going on pilgrimage, etc.,

00:38.470 --> 00:42.050
are just meant to show off.

00:42.050 --> 00:47.950
Now you have to discover the power that is within you and establish it.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.100
Guru Nanaka kept on repeating the same thing again and again.

00:52.100 --> 00:58.970
He never talked of rituals:

00:59.120 --> 01:07.420
But when Guru Teg- Bahadur came, tomorrow is his martyrs day,

01:07.450 --> 01:13.900
He was also of the same opinion

01:13.900 --> 01:18.470
but when there was the last Guru,

01:18.550 --> 01:26.020
war was being fought. So he prescribed Kada (iron bangle), long hair (not to cut hair) etc.

01:26.220 --> 01:33.370
All this was prescribed by him. But Guru Nanaka always talked of the spirit.

01:33.370 --> 01:35.370
Everything else is of no value,

01:35.370 --> 01:39.670
He explained it very clearly, but no one heeded what He wrote.

01:39.670 --> 01:44.870
They will just put a finger on the couplet and read it out.

01:44.870 --> 01:46.870
Could we understand him this way?

01:46.870 --> 01:50.900
If we go through His writings properly and absorb it,

01:50.900 --> 01:56.350
then the whole Shabad-Jalam (confusion), in which most of the people are caught, will come to an end.

01:56.350 --> 01:59.570
See the condition of Sikhs!

01:59.570 --> 02:04.400
They are not looking within themselves, which they should.

02:04.400 --> 02:09.620
Without looking within oneself, how could one follow Sikh religion?

02:09.620 --> 02:14.050
Only this is the teaching of Guru Nanaka, this is what is called `Sikhi’ (learning).

02:14.050 --> 02:17.470
This you have got in written, read it.

02:17.470 --> 02:23.470
All the saints of that age, before that age and after that,

02:23.470 --> 02:27.820
you have the discretion to know who is a saint and who is not.

02:27.820 --> 02:35.880
All the Gurus incorporated their poems and experiences in Guru Grantha and that is why Guru Grantha is revered so much.

02:35.880 --> 02:45.560
All the people, who were renowned as great Gurus at that time,

02:45.560 --> 02:48.760
had done great work and were spiritual,

02:48.760 --> 02:52.600
all their work was consolidated and put into Guru Granth Sahib.

02:52.600 --> 02:54.600
That is what we do in Sahaja Yoga.

02:54.600 --> 03:00.360
We do not follow any particular saint or incarnation; we respect all of them.

03:00.480 --> 03:07.960
This is what He did at that time. But whatever was said, was lost in words.

03:07.960 --> 03:10.040
People did not go deeper in them.

03:10.040 --> 03:22.360
That is why Kabira has written `even the scholars went on reading and reading like fools, without absorbing anything That is how a race of fools was created.

03:22.360 --> 03:39.920
Now there is no war being fought but they are so conditioned that they will wear Turbans, keep swords and combs etc.

03:39.920 --> 03:43.520
But they have no objection in consuming Alcohol.

03:43.520 --> 03:45.520
All the Gurus warned the disciples about the evil effects of alcohol.

03:45.520 --> 03:50.320
Any one talking of consciousness could never support wine.

03:50.320 --> 03:58.000
On the one side they will consume alcohol, on the other they wear turbans, keep swords and combs, and they are very conditioned about that!

03:58.000 --> 04:02.600
They wish to create a clan and be part of that clan.

04:02.600 --> 04:10.640
If they are busy doing all these things, when is the inner transformation going to take place, that He has talked about?

04:10.640 --> 04:16.920
They have taken to this kind of ritualism and as a result have come outside.

04:16.920 --> 04:21.200
Their attention is outside, they understand everything that is outside.

04:21.200 --> 04:28.480
To direct these people towards Sahaja yoga, should not be difficult because we (Sahaja Yogis) are doing what the He preached.

04:28.480 --> 04:33.280
He did not accomplish it; this is the difference that we have been doing it and He didn´t.

04:33.280 --> 04:35.520
They talked of achieving `Sahaja Samadhi’.

04:35.520 --> 04:39.720
How? It will happen thanks to Kundalini, even this fact was made clear.

04:39.720 --> 04:41.840
But who would raise the Kundalini? This He didn´t mention.

04:41.840 --> 04:51.120
Guru Nanaka gave realization to only two of his disciples.

04:51.120 --> 04:56.200
If one Guru gives realization to only two of his disciples, how effective can it be?

04:56.200 --> 05:01.280
So, people took His external form and started their work.

05:01.280 --> 05:10.440
Huge Gurudwaras were built. But there is no use.

05:10.440 --> 05:19.160
Very few evolved beings were made, the remaining is just a race of Sardars. How could truth be told to them?

05:19.160 --> 05:29.400
But now Sikhs have started coming to Sahaja Yoga, I have seen. At least 8 – 10 sikhs come regularly

05:29.400 --> 05:33.520
with turbans on. May be some of them are coming without turbans.

05:33.520 --> 05:37.720
There are also One is Namdhari Sikhs. Namdhari Sikhs believe in Me.

05:37.720 --> 05:40.640
There are many Namdhari Sikhs in Bankok.

05:40.640 --> 05:43.800
As many as fifty-sixty of them come to the Programme.

05:43.800 --> 05:45.800
They wear white turbans.

05:45.800 --> 05:56.320
I do not know what is their speciality, but they follow what Guru Nanak has said.

05:56.320 --> 06:05.120
That is how diversions are created and people start fighting amongst themselves. What for?

06:07.040 --> 06:21.440
Guru Nanaka said that I am prophet of Mohammedans and Guru of Hindus.

06:21.440 --> 06:27.040
Until one is realized one cannot understand this.

06:27.040 --> 06:32.320
But it was necessary to prepare us for this day.

06:32.320 --> 06:39.880
Now it is our duty to work-out what they said.

06:40.280 --> 06:47.960
Things, however, went in opposite direction and many seekers were lost, no-one knows where!

06:47.960 --> 06:52.160
I was talking about Gyan Deva, how great He was.

06:52.160 --> 06:54.160
He belongs to Nath cult.

06:54.160 --> 06:56.520
He wrote about Kundalini.

06:56.520 --> 07:01.240
His disciples call themselves varkaris.

07:01.240 --> 07:03.240
They make a show.

07:03.240 --> 07:12.760
They take two big heavy cymbals in their hands, weighing one kg together, beating these cymbals all the way long they go to Pandhari Nath, Pandhar Pur.

07:12.760 --> 07:19.120
The clothes they wear are called lattar, they are made up of jute and are torn.

07:19.120 --> 07:24.240
They consider themselves to be very sacrificing and It takes them one month to reach there, beating the cymbals.

07:24.240 --> 07:26.240
All the way they chew tobacco.

07:26.240 --> 07:33.400
These Varkari people have created this cult.

07:33.400 --> 07:41.680
The speciality of this cult is that they take procession of Gyan Deva on a palanquin.

07:41.680 --> 07:49.200
Gyan Deva never afforded shoes when he was alive, but people place his slipper, in the palanquin and take the procession from one village to another.

07:49.200 --> 07:53.560
When they reach a village, as the palanquin arrived the villagers offer them food and refreshment.

07:53.560 --> 07:56.560
Then they go to another village, again villagers offer them food as the palanquin had arrived.

07:56.560 --> 07:58.800
It is a new method of beggary.

07:58.800 --> 08:08.400
Thirdly, He was born in Alandi, near Pune.

08:08.400 --> 08:12.040
Later he went to Niwase, there He ....

08:12.040 --> 08:27.080
Women there take earthen pots with Tulsi in them and filled with soil, at least 3 – 4 kg,

08:27.080 --> 08:30.560
lift it on their heads and walk-in procession to Anandi.

08:30.560 --> 08:32.920
This I have seen myself.

08:32.920 --> 08:34.920
I do not understand, why they do so.

08:34.920 --> 08:42.120
People have made lot of money in the name of Gyna Deva.

08:42.120 --> 08:47.360
But I do not how people can believe in them.

08:47.360 --> 08:52.160
All His purpose has forfeited.

08:52.160 --> 09:06.680
One fellow gives big big lecture on Gyan Deva and earns a lot of money, speaks whatever he feels like and there are people listen to him.

09:06.680 --> 09:10.080
People are full of blind faith!

09:10.080 --> 09:13.400
Same is the case with Guru Nanaka.

09:13.400 --> 09:17.760
No one knows what He actually said and what he didn´t.

09:17.760 --> 09:21.320
People have made Chandigarh, Guru Nanaka talked of Chandi.

09:21.320 --> 09:23.320
He talked of My incarnation on the earth.

09:23.320 --> 09:25.320
He explained everything.

09:25.320 --> 09:28.760
But no one reads or listen to that.

09:28.760 --> 09:30.760
All of the prophets and Gurus have been treated like that.

09:30.760 --> 09:34.360
Now you have got the self-realisation.

09:34.360 --> 09:41.080
ou people have experienced the truth. So, you cannot accept the falsehood.

09:41.080 --> 09:44.640
If some falsehood emerges out of Sahaja, it will be destroyed.

09:44.640 --> 09:50.120
So many people have got their self-realization in the world, now falsehood cannot be spread.

09:50.120 --> 09:53.720
Whatever I have told in Sahaja Yoga is taped and recorded.

09:53.720 --> 09:55.720
No one could change it.

09:55.720 --> 09:58.200
This is why I didn´t write book.

09:58.200 --> 10:04.960
People should listen to tapes, but they go on reading books without understanding.

10:04.960 --> 10:12.280
It is better to have fewer books and there should be more to listen.

10:12.280 --> 10:15.120
Listening to the tapes will definitely have impact on their minds.

10:15.120 --> 10:18.120
People take book reading as a means of entertainment.

10:18.120 --> 10:20.120
What is the use of it?

10:20.120 --> 10:24.240
Now we will see what happens to Sahaja Yoga.

10:24.240 --> 10:25.120
I do not know.

10:25.120 --> 10:31.960
But now Sahaja Yogis have reached a level from where they cannot go astray, I believe.

10:31.960 --> 10:33.960
Do not take to wrongdoings.

10:33.960 --> 10:46.960
We have to learn from the life of Guru Nanaka, from what He said, He wrote a bunch of books, if we read Gurbani, it says `know thyself´.

10:46.960 --> 10:54.160
But what people are doing! However, in Sahaja Yoga such things will not happen since I have made them all mature.

10:54.160 --> 10:56.160
They cannot change now.

10:56.160 --> 11:00.960
No harm could be done now, even if someone wants to; what has happened has happened.

11:00.960 --> 11:09.480
He was disrespected, He had hard times, a lot was created by Him,

11:09.480 --> 11:16.720
but there is a point I would mention that He did not give self-realisation, He didn´t make people experience.

11:16.720 --> 11:27.440
And now, you may blame anyone, but it can happen only by awakening not by making changes in some scripture.

11:27.600 --> 11:37.520
This is what we should learn from Him that we will not go astray or we will notdraw any other meaning of it (Sahaja yoga), this is important.

11:37.520 --> 11:46.480
We are Sahaj yogis and we understand Sahaja Yoga so deeply that now there is no need to draw any other meaning of it.

11:46.480 --> 11:50.240
Still there are people, one or two, who start dictating – “Do this way or that way”.

11:50.240 --> 11:52.240
It is all useless.

11:52.240 --> 12:05.760
All falsehood, without any truth in it. They dictate – “Do this way or that way”

12:05.760 --> 12:14.480
I have never said so, yet people are doing what I have never said.

12:14.480 --> 12:18.000
So now when they will listen and learn.

12:18.000 --> 12:22.520
By reading it cannot be conceived that much, as much can be conceived by listening.

12:22.680 --> 12:27.160
They will understand Mother has not said that therefore they will not do that.

12:27.160 --> 12:31.600
But because of old Sanskara (conditioning) we keep on observing certain rituals.

12:31.600 --> 12:36.240
Secondly, they want to practise, what they have been practising since their birth.

12:36.240 --> 12:40.880
So long as we do not get rid of our conditionings, we shall not understand real Sahaja Yoga.

12:40.880 --> 12:42.880
I have made you very special people.

12:42.880 --> 12:45.640
You are special people.

12:45.640 --> 12:50.200
You know the real meaning of religion.

12:50.200 --> 12:53.440
You know everything, you know about yourself and about others.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.440
You could give realisation to people.

12:55.440 --> 12:58.720
So now you have become perfect.

12:58.720 --> 13:03.600
So, what is there to go astray now? You cannot fall.

13:03.600 --> 13:07.840
So today I thought of the pains of Guru Nanaka.

13:07.840 --> 13:11.760
How much he tolerated! His wife was not cooperative at all.

13:11.760 --> 13:15.560
He had problems, even then He did so much.

13:15.560 --> 13:18.000
What people have made of his achievements?

13:18.000 --> 13:28.920
These people are misusing Lord Christ, Mohammad Sahib and, above all, Guru Nanaka because he was the last incarnation.

13:28.920 --> 13:32.080
He worked a lot.

13:33.600 --> 13:36.920
Shirdi Sainath incarnated after him.

13:36.920 --> 13:42.120
He said there is no need, there is no use doing anything, He said clearly,

13:42.240 --> 13:49.200
whatever is started, people spoil it after some time, because they are not awakened.

13:49.200 --> 13:52.160
After awakening, things change of course.

13:52.160 --> 13:54.160
People become one, they become wise.

13:54.160 --> 13:57.640
Without realization it is difficult.

13:57.640 --> 14:03.160
So, Sai Nath did not anything, He did not organise people, He did not unite people, nothing.

14:03.160 --> 14:05.160
He had disciples, that is all.

14:05.160 --> 14:08.400
I have also not organised.

14:08.400 --> 14:10.400
We have no organization.

14:10.400 --> 14:20.000
People automatically get organized after awakening, the way different organs of the body are organized.

14:20.000 --> 14:28.680
So, without any organization everything is going on immaculately in Sahaja Yoga.

14:31.240 --> 14:37.320
My eternal blessings to you all.

14:37.320 --> 14:44.240
You have to keep in mind that we have not to pervert what we have achieved.

14:44.240 --> 14:46.240
It is most sacrilegious.

14:46.240 --> 14:50.440
Do not pervert it, for any reason.

14:50.440 --> 14:52.440
Perversion should not be allowed.

14:52.440 --> 14:56.640
My eternal bless
