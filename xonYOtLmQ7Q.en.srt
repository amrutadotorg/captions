00:00:00,056 --> 00:00:14,818
2000-0425 Public Program, Istanbul, Turkey
 Levent Kirca and Oya Basar Theatre

2
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:05,441
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

3
00:04:12,658 --> 00:04:17,515
These are the days of greatest turmoil.

4
00:04:22,713 --> 00:04:29,899
We can see around us all kinds of calamities coming.

5
00:04:37,575 --> 00:04:41,122
Also, what we find is

6
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:45,778
 human beings are not happy
 with themselves and with others.

7
00:04:53,068 --> 00:04:59,040
That means, there is something basically wrong with us

8
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:02,646
that we cannot live in peace all of us together.

9
00:05:11,383 --> 00:05:13,708
We have no joy,

10
00:05:13,812 --> 00:05:16,327
we cannot enjoy our life.

11
00:05:21,818 --> 00:05:26,289
We are unnecessarily so miserable.

12
00:05:30,555 --> 00:05:35,467
Whether rich or poor, whatever may be the condition.

13
00:05:35,486 --> 00:05:38,303
 People are not very happy.

14
00:05:46,117 --> 00:05:48,260
What is the reason?

15
00:05:51,109 --> 00:05:56,196
Have we been created for miseries and troubles?

16
00:06:02,314 --> 00:06:05,761
To suffer from all kinds of diseases

17
00:06:05,796 --> 00:06:09,311
and all kinds of infections.

18
00:06:19,293 --> 00:06:27,307
The nature also, the mother earth,
everything is not unison with us.

19
00:06:36,871 --> 00:06:40,958
The reason is we are not ourselves.

20
00:06:45,227 --> 00:06:51,546
It is very important as said by everyone
 that you should know yourself.

21
00:06:58,015 --> 00:07:00,920
But how are we to know.

22
00:07:03,638 --> 00:07:06,656
Now the time has come.

23
00:07:10,426 --> 00:07:14,219
In the Quran, it has described two stages,

24
00:07:14,376 --> 00:07:18,267
one is the Qiyam (to stand up)
 and another is Qiyamat (Doomsday).

25
00:07:24,636 --> 00:07:30,677
We can be saved and can enjoy the Qiyamat.

26
00:07:38,081 --> 00:07:40,216
Or we can be destroyed

27
00:07:43,498 --> 00:07:45,951
and suffer the Qiyamat.

28
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:52,473
So, this is the time of judgement.

29
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:58,958
It is described in all the scriptures.

30
00:08:03,557 --> 00:08:06,104
Whatever you may believe,

31
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:09,780
whatever you may think, makes no difference.

32
00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:21,020
Whatever place you live, whatever country you belong to

33
00:08:21,048 --> 00:08:24,055
 has nothing to do with you.

34
00:08:35,372 --> 00:08:39,379
Now, how the judgement is going to take place.

35
00:08:43,102 --> 00:08:45,133
Within us lies,

36
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:49,590
a power that our creator has put in

37
00:08:49,615 --> 00:08:53,537
the triangular bone called as sacrum.

38
00:09:06,624 --> 00:09:11,000
This is the power which  is going to give us the

39
00:09:11,015 --> 00:09:15,510
 higher state of existence when we know ourselves.

40
00:09:25,114 --> 00:09:33,296
Otherwise, we are lost in
 the  mess of this worldly illusions.

41
00:09:40,821 --> 00:09:46,273
This is the power which in Sanskrit
we call as Kundalini.

42
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:56,772
Because it moves like a snake, some people
 also call it a serpent power.

43
00:10:04,814 --> 00:10:08,512
But this power is your individual mother.

44
00:10:12,605 --> 00:10:15,954
She has no other child but yourself.

45
00:10:19,383 --> 00:10:21,708
She knows everything about you.

46
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,676
She knows what are your aspirations,

47
00:10:33,968 --> 00:10:36,444
she knows what are your mistakes,

48
00:10:39,161 --> 00:10:44,756
also she knows what is the physical
mental problems you have.

49
00:10:50,866 --> 00:10:55,659
When you were born, your mother took
all the trouble upon herself.

50
00:11:04,526 --> 00:11:08,732
But, she did  trouble you.

51
00:11:15,315 --> 00:11:21,316
So, when this mother of yours
gives you your second birth,

52
00:11:21,365 --> 00:11:25,026
she takes all your troubles upon herself.

53
00:11:36,012 --> 00:11:41,938
I have come here to tell you that
you have this power, all of you.

54
00:11:47,854 --> 00:11:49,786
If it is awakened

55
00:11:49,812 --> 00:11:53,001
and crosses through the six subtle centres,

56
00:11:53,026 --> 00:11:57,307
passes through our sixth centre here

57
00:11:57,332 --> 00:12:02,987
it gets connected to the all-pervading power of divine love.

58
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:22,233
Einstein has said that he was tired,
 Einstein was tired

59
00:12:22,258 --> 00:12:27,430
 trying to find out about the theory of relativity.

60
00:12:42,092 --> 00:12:44,116
And he got very tired,

61
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,840
he went into his garden and started playing…

62
00:12:47,936 --> 00:12:51,025
started playing with the soap bubbles.

63
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:04,525
While playing with the soap bubbles, he says,

64
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,800
I do not know from somewhere unknown

65
00:13:07,825 --> 00:13:11,637
the theory of relativity dawned upon me.

66
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:25,398
He called it torsion area, in his own language.

67
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:33,506
Even you  the disciple for it

68
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:37,271
who discarded his master

69
00:13:37,303 --> 00:13:42,207
and said that there is something beyond us,

70
00:13:42,232 --> 00:13:45,256
where we have to go beyond our mind.

71
00:13:57,857 --> 00:14:02,510
Because  this mind,
because this mind,

72
00:14:02,743 --> 00:14:04,695
reacts to everything.

73
00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:12,739
It is all the time reacting.

74
00:14:16,235 --> 00:14:19,498
And that is how we are upset.

75
00:14:22,909 --> 00:14:26,044
These thoughts come to us

76
00:14:26,063 --> 00:14:30,618
all the time either from the future or from the past.

77
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:42,217
But we cannot be in the present.

78
00:14:45,573 --> 00:14:48,255
One thought rises like this then falls on

79
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:52,409
another thought rises like this and falls down.

80
00:14:58,893 --> 00:15:01,527
But when this Kundalini rises,

81
00:15:01,544 --> 00:15:05,503
these thoughts elongate and
there is a space in-between

82
00:15:05,544 --> 00:15:09,806
 and that is the place where there is our present.

83
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:26,733
So, we come in the present

84
00:15:29,724 --> 00:15:32,900
and reality is in the present.

85
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:41,123
So you know the reality

86
00:15:41,227 --> 00:15:44,782
and you have the knowledge about yourself.

87
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:52,354
How?

88
00:15:52,402 --> 00:15:57,841
 Because when you get connected with this
 all-pervading power, this divine power,

89
00:15:57,866 --> 00:16:04,786
your hands start emitting kind of
very nice cool vibrations.

90
00:16:23,517 --> 00:16:25,659
This is the Ruh.

91
00:16:27,524 --> 00:16:34,674
This is the divine cool breeze, of divine love.

92
00:16:40,768 --> 00:16:44,005
And in your hand on your fingertips,

93
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:46,420
you can feel your centres.

94
00:16:53,442 --> 00:16:56,474
That means your hands start speaking,

95
00:17:00,832 --> 00:17:03,988
that’s what Mohammed Sahab has said.

96
00:17:04,013 --> 00:17:09,698
That at the time of Qiyama, your hands will speak.

97
00:17:19,962 --> 00:17:22,827
So this is the time of Qiyama,

98
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:28,260
where thousands and thousands of people have felt it.

99
00:17:35,142 --> 00:17:40,834
If your hands don’t speak about your centres,

100
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:45,495
then I would not say you really are a Muselmann.

101
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:59,525
This is said by Mohammed Sahab.

102
00:18:02,594 --> 00:18:10,071
So as a result what we should expect is
 that our hands should speak,

103
00:18:17,831 --> 00:18:24,764
so that we get the knowledge
about ourselves about our centres.

104
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:34,211
We know about ourselves very well.

105
00:18:34,243 --> 00:18:45,125
Also, we know that this body of
 ours is an instrument of God’s wish.

106
00:18:56,945 --> 00:19:01,957
Because now we are connected with the divine power.

107
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:07,988
And we have all the knowledge
 which is absolutely true.

108
00:19:18,254 --> 00:19:21,859
So, this is the path of absolute knowledge.

109
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:32,608
Supposing there is a man
who talks big and boasts,

110
00:19:32,637 --> 00:19:36,470
how are we to know that
he is not a hypocrite?

111
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:51,981
As soon as you put your hands towards that person,

112
00:19:52,007 --> 00:19:55,548
immediately you will know if it is hot

113
00:19:55,580 --> 00:20:00,081
or sometimes even you  get some little little bit prickles

114
00:20:00,106 --> 00:20:02,775
then you know he is not a good man.

115
00:20:17,651 --> 00:20:22,187
Not only that but supposing
you are suffering from some disease

116
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:29,837
and you will not know it till you go through
the whole procedure of medical investigation.

117
00:20:40,545 --> 00:20:46,282
And also that they will not be very sure
as to what is wrong with you.

118
00:20:53,449 --> 00:20:57,139
But on your fingertips, you will know about yourself,

119
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:59,048
what’s wrong with you.

120
00:21:09,186 --> 00:21:12,601
You will be all in charge,

121
00:21:16,527 --> 00:21:19,518
incomplete knowledge about yourself.

122
00:21:23,275 --> 00:21:28,287
And if you know how to correct your centres,

123
00:21:28,312 --> 00:21:31,480
you can correct the centres of others.

124
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:45,154
Imagine what powers you have.

125
00:21:48,611 --> 00:21:52,755
For example, if this instrument is not connected,

126
00:21:52,817 --> 00:21:56,602
you won’t hear me and it is useless.

127
00:22:05,521 --> 00:22:09,252
But, if you are connected to the divine

128
00:22:09,263 --> 00:22:11,892
the energy starts flowing through you.

129
00:22:21,647 --> 00:22:26,417
But best is this power rises,
she passes through six centres,

130
00:22:26,442 --> 00:22:29,104
she enlightens them.

131
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:40,242
She integrates them.

132
00:22:45,105 --> 00:22:48,009
Not only that, but

133
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:53,238
it informs you

134
00:22:53,453 --> 00:22:57,382
what’s wrong with you and you can correct it.

135
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:11,734
All your reactions stop.

136
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:21,039
But you watch everything without thinking.

137
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:29,608
Like you become a witness.

138
00:23:32,693 --> 00:23:34,660
In that witness state,

139
00:23:34,677 --> 00:23:37,416
you know the truth about everything.

140
00:23:42,965 --> 00:23:45,163
This is so simple.

141
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:51,868
All this can happen without paying for it

142
00:23:55,612 --> 00:23:58,987
because kundalini doesn’t understand money

143
00:24:01,843 --> 00:24:04,644
nor God takes any money.

144
00:24:06,806 --> 00:24:11,960
It is different if you have to book
the hall, we pay for it,

145
00:24:17,858 --> 00:24:20,532
but not for kundalini awakening.

146
00:24:26,113 --> 00:24:29,465
And you get your experience.

147
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:31,023
It’s not just talking.

148
00:24:31,055 --> 00:24:34,453
It is the experience on your fingertips

149
00:24:34,485 --> 00:24:37,773
and out of your fontanelle bone area.

150
00:24:51,646 --> 00:24:56,188
There’s no question of blind faith.

151
00:25:04,941 --> 00:25:11,125
It is just the complete understanding

152
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:13,869
within yourself, of your being.

153
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:25,200
This is what is Qiyama,

154
00:25:25,224 --> 00:25:29,774
 it is where you evolve into a superhuman being.

155
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:43,070
This country was especially blessed by the Sufis.

156
00:25:48,184 --> 00:25:51,692
They had the experience of the divine

157
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:54,767
but they could not explain how get what it.

158
00:26:04,544 --> 00:26:07,194
But Mohammed Sahab has described it,

159
00:26:07,268 --> 00:26:14,322
that he was riding on a white horse,
which means the kundalini.

160
00:26:21,183 --> 00:26:26,419
And then he met Moses on the third heaven,

161
00:26:26,483 --> 00:26:30,551
which is true because we too know that all these

162
00:26:30,567 --> 00:26:33,857
prophets are on the third heaven.

163
00:26:44,499 --> 00:26:49,514
Whatever I am saying you can
verify after your realization.

164
00:26:56,843 --> 00:27:00,930
But as a result of kundalini awakening,

165
00:27:00,955 --> 00:27:05,149
all our enemies of anger,

166
00:27:05,229 --> 00:27:08,724
sexual misbehaviour,

167
00:27:09,966 --> 00:27:14,652
that all kinds of bribes, jealousies,

168
00:27:14,724 --> 00:27:16,448
all drop out.

169
00:27:31,606 --> 00:27:33,827
All the greed also drops out.

170
00:27:37,318 --> 00:27:39,445
Jealousies drop out

171
00:27:41,963 --> 00:27:44,359
because you are enlightened.

172
00:27:47,477 --> 00:27:51,889
In the darkness, you cannot see who is your enemy.

173
00:27:56,585 --> 00:27:59,553
But when you are enlightened,

174
00:27:59,572 --> 00:28:03,861
you know everything and you don’t do anything

175
00:28:03,886 --> 00:28:05,859
that is destructive.

176
00:28:16,396 --> 00:28:19,943
You drop all your destructive habits.

177
00:28:24,171 --> 00:28:29,265
And what comes in your heart is the joy,

178
00:28:29,339 --> 00:28:35,824
is the joy which cannot be described.

179
00:28:43,378 --> 00:28:49,163
For example, we have unhappiness
 and happiness.

180
00:28:53,293 --> 00:28:55,300
Two sides of a coin.

181
00:28:59,856 --> 00:29:05,269
But after realization, you are in complete joy.

182
00:29:12,725 --> 00:29:16,454
And you become absolutely peaceful.

183
00:29:19,935 --> 00:29:23,157
Now what we need is peace.

184
00:29:26,077 --> 00:29:29,560
They are having so many peace conferences

185
00:29:29,593 --> 00:29:32,142
and spending so much money

186
00:29:32,175 --> 00:29:35,097
but they themselves are quarrelling.

187
00:29:43,888 --> 00:29:47,562
So what is the use of having those conferences?

188
00:29:51,797 --> 00:29:55,464
But you have to become peaceful within yourself

189
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:03,360
because you become very collective.

190
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:10,273
You develop the collective consciousness.

191
00:30:13,604 --> 00:30:15,651
Who is the other?

192
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:21,912
You are the part and parcel of one god almighty.

193
00:30:27,303 --> 00:30:31,580
This house and can felt  for this hand,

194
00:30:31,657 --> 00:30:36,719
in the same way, we all feel
 the same within ourselves.

195
00:30:45,103 --> 00:30:50,105
You’ll be surprised sometimes
we have a conference of people

196
00:30:50,145 --> 00:30:54,663
who come from sometimes eighty countries.

197
00:30:54,688 --> 00:30:59,018
Black, white, yellow, every colour.

198
00:30:59,062 --> 00:31:02,880
And there is no quarrel, no fighting.

199
00:31:20,395 --> 00:31:23,108
Thousands and thousands of them.

200
00:31:23,334 --> 00:31:26,159
They enjoy each other’s contrary

201
00:31:26,191 --> 00:31:28,286
and help each other.

202
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:38,111
You may be in Turkey

203
00:31:38,151 --> 00:31:41,237
but you will find friends in all the countries,

204
00:31:41,262 --> 00:31:44,244
 your brother are there and sister are there.

205
00:31:52,659 --> 00:31:54,794
You are no more alone.

206
00:31:57,458 --> 00:32:02,150
You can have them in every field of life,

207
00:32:02,231 --> 00:32:04,875
as your own brother.

208
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:15,124
It is something we are not aware of ourselves

209
00:32:15,149 --> 00:32:19,986
that we don’t know how great our powers of love.

210
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:32,284
That a drop which falls in the ocean
becomes the ocean.

211
00:32:32,378 --> 00:32:35,338
You also become the ocean,

212
00:32:35,354 --> 00:32:37,782
 all your limitations drop out.

213
00:32:49,379 --> 00:32:52,989
This is what is going to happen to you tonight.

214
00:32:56,899 --> 00:33:00,835
I don’t know if I should ask you to ask me questions.

215
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:03,786
But if you think it is important then ask,

216
00:33:03,802 --> 00:33:06,336
but ask something important questions

217
00:33:06,337 --> 00:33:11,087
because you shouldn’t disturb the people around.

218
00:33:40,583 --> 00:33:45,035
Another thing is, it will take hardly ten minutes

219
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:50,141
or fifteen minutes for you all to get your self- realization.

220
00:33:57,747 --> 00:34:01,913
If anyone doesn’t want it,
they should leave the hall.

221
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:12,070
The only condition is that

222
00:34:12,095 --> 00:34:16,658
you should forgive everyone.

223
00:34:21,763 --> 00:34:24,047
Also, forgive yourself.

224
00:34:27,512 --> 00:34:32,044
Just you have to say I forgive
 everyone in your heart.

225
00:34:37,459 --> 00:34:42,738
Don’t also think whom you have to forgive
but in general,

226
00:34:42,763 --> 00:34:46,689
you should  say I forgive everyone.

227
00:34:54,865 --> 00:34:58,293
Also, you have to forgive yourself.

228
00:35:01,806 --> 00:35:07,268
You might have done something wrong, doesn’t matter.

229
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:14,311
That was in the past.

230
00:35:16,458 --> 00:35:18,577
We are in the present.

231
00:35:21,642 --> 00:35:24,723
Another thing is, that

232
00:35:24,819 --> 00:35:29,719
whether you forgive or
you don’t forgive, you don’t do anything.

233
00:35:35,545 --> 00:35:40,229
But if you don't forgive
then you play to wrong hands.

234
00:35:44,904 --> 00:35:49,713
So, now we will have the session for self-realization.

235
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:59,597
For that, can I request all the cameraman

236
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:04,687
not to take any photograph and to keep quiet?

237
00:36:15,315 --> 00:36:16,782
Just for ten minutes.

238
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:21,690
But when they will raise their hand

239
00:36:21,707 --> 00:36:25,853
saying they have got self-realization,
then we can take.

240
00:36:35,874 --> 00:36:38,881
So, please wait only for about ten minutes.

241
00:36:45,015 --> 00:36:48,580
Now, as I told you,

242
00:36:48,616 --> 00:36:51,433
you have to forgive yourself

243
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:53,547
and you have to forgive others.

244
00:36:53,595 --> 00:36:55,285
This is very important.

245
00:37:04,694 --> 00:37:11,094
What you can do now is, just to put
 both your hands towards to me like this.

246
00:37:19,106 --> 00:37:20,962
Just like this, simple like this.

247
00:37:22,147 --> 00:37:25,895
Do it like you do for Namaz. Please do like this.

248
00:37:32,754 --> 00:37:34,261
Alright.

249
00:37:45,534 --> 00:37:51,052
Please again forgive yourself
and forgive everyone else.

250
00:37:58,704 --> 00:38:07,819
Now, you can bend your head

251
00:38:11,024 --> 00:38:16,319
and put your left hand top of your

252
00:38:16,376 --> 00:38:21,651
fontanel bone area which was
the soft on your childhood,

253
00:38:21,659 --> 00:38:25,106
on top and above.

254
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:37,331
Now see, if there is a cool or hot breeze

255
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:41,207
coming out of your fontanel bone area,

256
00:38:41,224 --> 00:38:42,558
please move your hand.

257
00:38:55,184 --> 00:38:57,264
Have faith in yourself,

258
00:38:59,209 --> 00:39:01,360
forgive yourself.

259
00:39:05,069 --> 00:39:09,799
Alright, now please put your left hand towards me

260
00:39:09,834 --> 00:39:14,685
and with the right hand
 please see, bend your head,

261
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:20,834
please see if there is a cool breeze
 coming out your fontanel bone area.

262
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,799
If it is hot, then

263
00:39:34,857 --> 00:39:38,970
you have not forgiven either yourself or others.

264
00:39:39,005 --> 00:39:40,845
So Please do that now.

265
00:39:54,376 --> 00:39:56,098
Alright,

266
00:39:58,086 --> 00:40:00,310
now again, once more,

267
00:40:00,333 --> 00:40:03,129
put your right hand towards me like this open

268
00:40:03,154 --> 00:40:05,209
and see with your left hand.

269
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:08,404
Bend your head and see for yourself

270
00:40:08,413 --> 00:40:14,259
is there a cool or hot breeze coming out
 of your fontanel bone area.

271
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:32,383
Now, please put your both the hands towards me

272
00:40:35,525 --> 00:40:40,730
and please don`t think,
 can you do that, don`t think

273
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:18,032
Now please see, if you are getting cool
or hot breeze on yourfingertips.

274
00:41:18,094 --> 00:41:20,157
It can be gentle

275
00:41:28,171 --> 00:41:33,051
or you are getting it on your palms

276
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,960
 or out of your fontanel bone area.

277
00:41:44,513 --> 00:41:51,687
Anywhere if you are getting cool or
hot breeze please raise your hands,

278
00:42:06,263 --> 00:42:09,945
You all become sufis now. Congratulations.

279
00:42:11,172 --> 00:42:13,402
May God bless you.

280
00:42:18,664 --> 00:42:21,783
Turkey is a very Divine place

281
00:42:25,124 --> 00:42:28,814
and such a short time you got your realization.

282
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:35,726
Don't doubt it please.

283
00:42:39,226 --> 00:42:41,293
Alright, take down your hands.

284
00:42:52,293 --> 00:42:59,416
I saw more ladies in the airport [UNCLEAR] you see.

285
00:42:59,506 --> 00:43:06,519
but I want men also to become realized souls,
very important.

286
00:43:15,736 --> 00:43:22,183
Now you will know what is
pure love, pure compassion

287
00:43:29,197 --> 00:43:35,459
because this is the power of
 Divine compassion, Divine Love.

288
00:43:41,992 --> 00:43:44,143
May God bless you all.

289
00:43:47,935 --> 00:43:52,936
They will sing one song which we shold clap

290
00:43:52,984 --> 00:43:58,832
and you will see that these vibrations
 of cool breeze will increase.

291
00:44:14,192 --> 00:44:18,167
For five minutes, you just feel again.
