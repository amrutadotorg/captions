00:00:07.717 --> 00:00:12.693
Pujari: Now the names of Lord Vishnu. Om Shri Keshavaya Namah,

00:00:12.894 --> 00:00:18.522
Om Shri Narayanaya Namah, Om Shri Madhavaya Namah,

00:00:18.723 --> 00:00:24.306
Om Shri Govindaya Namah, Om Shri Vishnuve Namah,

00:00:24.507 --> 00:00:29.661
Om (Shri) Madhusudanaya Namah, Om Shri Trivikramaya Namah,

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:35.095
Om Shri Vamanaya Namah, Om Shri Shridharaya Namah,

00:00:35.296 --> 00:00:40.947
Om Shri Hrishikeshaya Namah, Om Shri Sankarshanaya Namah,

00:00:41.148 --> 00:00:46.835
Om Shri Vasudevaya Namah, Om Shri Pradyumnaya Namah,

00:00:47.036 --> 00:00:52.688
Om Shri Aniruddhaya Namah, Om Shri Purushottamaya Namah,

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:58.250
Om Shri Aghokshajaya Namah, Om Shri Narasimhaya Namah,

00:00:58.451 --> 00:01:03.572
Om Shri Achyutaya Namah, Om Shri Janardanaya Namah,

00:01:03.773 --> 00:01:09.003
Om Shri Padmanabhaya Namah, Om Shri Damodaraya Namah,

00:01:09.204 --> 00:01:14.545
Om Shri Upendraya Namah, Om Shri Haraye Namah,

00:01:14.746 --> 00:01:17.356
Om Shri Krishnaye Namah.

00:01:17.557 --> 00:01:20.771
Sakshat Shri Adi Shakti Bhagavati Mataji

00:01:20.972 --> 00:01:23.950
Shri Nirmala Devyai Namoh Namah.

00:01:24.158 --> 00:01:31.281
Shri Mataji: Why these twenty-one names are taken before every puja,

00:01:31.482 --> 00:01:34.638
even before the today renovation of it?

00:01:34.839 --> 00:01:39.683
First you have to worship Shri Ganesha.

00:01:39.884 --> 00:01:43.604
But even before worshipping why these names are taken,

00:01:43.805 --> 00:01:47.223
is important to understand, everything has a why.

00:01:47.424 --> 00:01:57.511
Because these are the twenty-one channels within your Sushumna,

00:01:57.712 --> 00:02:00.636
twenty-one channels, we should say, in this

00:02:00.837 --> 00:02:05.869
complete Ida, Pingala and Sushumna Nadi.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.491
So to raise you,

00:02:14.516 --> 00:02:18.000
absolutely to give you the ascent,

00:02:18.258 --> 00:02:22.057
twenty- one channels in Ida, Pingala, Sushumna.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.992
So one would say seven channels in the Sushumna Nadi.

00:02:26.193 --> 00:02:34.996
But these seven channels are divided multiplied by seven into three.

00:02:35.197 --> 00:02:40.541
So every channel has got twenty-one (inner? Unclear) channels.

00:02:44.311 --> 00:02:50.302
So Sushumna Nadi has got also twenty-one channels.

00:02:51.391 --> 00:02:53.879
Left-hand side Nadis are as you know that –

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.896
perhaps you know, I don’t know if you know the names or not.

00:02:58.144 --> 00:03:01.932
And the right hand side also, like Gayatri,

00:03:02.133 --> 00:03:06.697
Parvati and all these are on the righ hand side.

00:03:06.898 --> 00:03:14.056
And the left ones are called as Chamundi,

00:03:14.257 --> 00:03:19.489
and all these left-sided things, there are seven of them.

00:03:20.673 --> 00:03:26.246
Now, the central path has got twenty-one channels

00:03:26.367 --> 00:03:29.771
and has got twenty-one powers.

00:03:29.972 --> 00:03:34.643
And their deities are named

00:03:36.185 --> 00:03:40.865
according to the twenty-one aspects of Shri Vishnu.

00:03:41.066 --> 00:03:46.801
And that’s why these twenty-one aspects are first said,

00:03:47.002 --> 00:03:50.421
so that within you all these twenty-one channels are awakened.

00:03:50.622 --> 00:03:53.771
Within you, first of all.

00:03:53.972 --> 00:04:01.032
Puja is a double thing, that a cup has to be made

00:04:01.233 --> 00:04:06.277
and then this source has to be opened out.

00:04:06.478 --> 00:04:08.318
So you are the cup.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.838
The Sushumna is the channel you have by which you suck in.

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:18.588
So to open the Sushumna these twenty-one names are said.

00:04:19.892 --> 00:04:23.760
Now, why first Shri Ganesha?

00:04:23.961 --> 00:04:28.070
Because Shri Ganesha is the beginning of the desire.

00:04:28.191 --> 00:04:30.671
And the end of the desire.

00:04:30.902 --> 00:04:33.968
You start with Ganesha and end up with Ganesha.

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.335
And that’s why Shri Ganesha is worshipped.

00:04:36.536 --> 00:04:40.140
Is the other way round now, the source.

00:04:40.411 --> 00:04:44.692
When you direct your attention to the source you worship it,

00:04:44.893 --> 00:04:50.596
and when you want to incite or open out your own being,

00:04:50.717 --> 00:04:52.913
then you chant it.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.244
This is the difference between worship and a mantra.

00:04:59.445 --> 00:05:04.123
If you just say mantra, you open yourself up.

00:05:04.324 --> 00:05:11.183
But when you worship and chant, then you tap the source.

00:05:11.987 --> 00:05:14.163
I don’t know if I’ve said this before or not.

00:05:14.284 --> 00:05:16.718
Yogi: No, no, no. Shri Mataji: No? All right.

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:19.406
That’s how you understand the puja part.

00:05:19.607 --> 00:05:27.248
Now, those who are newcomers, their cup is completely useless.

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:30.729
And when you excite the deities, they get busy opening their cups,

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.368
everybody’s cups also. So it’s a double work.

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:37.378
But if your cup is ready, it’s very easy to fill in.

00:05:40.574 --> 00:05:43.301
So now these twenty-one names I think you should take again

00:05:43.422 --> 00:05:46.794
with the understanding, is better. All right.

00:05:49.355 --> 00:05:55.954
Pujari: Om Shri Keshavaya Namah, Om Shri Narayanaya Namah,

00:05:56.155 --> 00:06:02.672
