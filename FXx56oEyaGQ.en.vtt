WEBVTT

00:04.872 --> 00:10.618
1996-0929 Krishna Puja, Camp Vacamas,
New York, USA

08:17.685 --> 08:20.502
Shri Mataji: Wa wa wa.

09:00.450 --> 09:03.402
Shri Mataji: Wa wa wa.

09:17.906 --> 09:22.485
Wa wa wa. Now. (Hindi)

09:28.877 --> 09:33.260
We are all sitting like a family sitting
together.

09:37.887 --> 09:42.730
There should be a show there, eh?...
Done very well.

10:02.538 --> 10:04.808
They’re from Vienna? …

10:11.018 --> 10:17.530
A composition which you yourself have
made it into dance - … wa wa.

10:17.984 --> 10:21.829
Bring her to Cabella. Yogi: Yes.
Yogini: Yes, Shri Mataji.

10:26.127 --> 10:31.179
Shri Mataji: Wa wa wa. Such a dancer,
she is a teacher also.

10:39.397 --> 10:44.198
I’ll take your leave, and I’ll try to come
to tomorrow’s program also]

11:16.090 --> 11:19.702
[Hindi]

12:08.860 --> 12:13.614
Today we have decided to have Krishna Puja

12:13.815 --> 12:19.439
because America is the Krishna bhoomi.

12:24.235 --> 12:30.590
It’s very surprising that such a great
incarnation of Shri Krishna

12:30.791 --> 12:42.568
came even much later than Rama and has
sent His special people to live in America.

12:43.972 --> 12:50.232
Of course, there are many who are seeking
in this country, no doubt.

12:50.433 --> 12:54.758
But there are many who are also misleading
them.

12:54.959 --> 13:04.067
That’s how you find, despite all our
effort, we have not been able

13:05.005 --> 13:09.579
to expand Sahaja Yoga very much.

13:12.922 --> 13:19.493
What one has to learn from His life
is very, very important.

13:19.686 --> 13:26.407
The first and foremost thing He taught
was collectivity.

13:27.432 --> 13:32.580
He used to get hold of small boys

13:34.947 --> 13:39.310
and play with them together.

13:42.282 --> 13:45.356
Rama didn't do that.

13:46.428 --> 13:51.354
He used to get hold of ladies

13:51.623 --> 14:00.824
who were selling milk and also butter,

14:01.036 --> 14:09.071
those who used to go to fill their waters -
water in the pitcher.

14:10.810 --> 14:22.196
He is the one who collected all such people
in the village of Gokul.

14:24.034 --> 14:33.456
He played all kinds of pranks on His
friends

14:33.657 --> 14:40.002
and His mother and the mother’s friends.

14:40.958 --> 14:45.500
Behaved just like a very naughty child,

14:46.533 --> 14:54.120
ust to show that He was just like
all of us.

14:55.445 --> 15:00.525
As you know, He was the incarnation
of Shri Vishnu.

15:00.726 --> 15:11.144
First Shri Rama was born, took incarnation
as Shri Rama,

15:11.679 --> 15:20.025
which was in the Aryan race, means that
time we had

15:20.226 --> 15:29.573
an Aryan race which was sort of superior,
superior race than others.

15:29.774 --> 15:36.758
But when He came as Krishna, He took
His birth

15:37.600 --> 15:44.217
in Yadav dynasty, you can call it.

15:44.418 --> 15:52.686
They were not superior, they were selling
milk, having cowherds

15:52.887 --> 16:02.834
and doing work not of any religious style.

16:03.232 --> 16:09.030
But they were innocent simple people
living in the villages,

16:09.231 --> 16:17.707
and they saw the great miracles
of Shri Krishna’s childhood.

16:17.908 --> 16:22.667
He killed demons. He killed Pootana.

16:22.868 --> 16:29.799
All these people were sent by His uncle
Kamsa to kill him.

16:33.750 --> 16:38.071
It was to be, because He had to prove that
He was the incarnation

16:38.272 --> 16:41.604
of Shri Vishnu and He did it.

16:41.805 --> 16:47.284
As a child, how He killed those people
is remarkable.

16:47.485 --> 16:52.990
And how He made them out though they were
all camouflaged.

16:57.084 --> 17:00.936
n these modern times, difficult for people
to believe

17:01.137 --> 17:07.260
that there could have been any incarnation
like Shri Krishna.

17:07.562 --> 17:18.445
But in Sahaja Yoga, we have method
of absolutely establishing the truth

17:18.646 --> 17:24.261
that Shri Krishna was there ruling
on the Vishuddhi chakra.

17:25.122 --> 17:29.736
From His childhood, you can see He was
fond of collectivity.

17:30.450 --> 17:34.825
And He tried to create collectivity
of people

17:35.026 --> 17:41.479
who were very simple, uneducated,
good-hearted people.

17:41.804 --> 17:45.758
And that is His special quality.

17:45.959 --> 17:54.149
And all the people of that village knew Him
very well, all cared for Him.

17:54.350 --> 17:57.870
And when He had to go,

17:58.679 --> 18:05.596
they felt very sad and all of them came
running and crying for Him.

18:05.796 --> 18:09.602
It was a small boy who was going.

18:09.803 --> 18:15.997
After all, what is there? A little boy
from the village is going.

18:16.198 --> 18:20.838
The whole village had gathered
to cry for Him.

18:27.639 --> 18:32.023
That is what we all Sahaja Yogis have
to know.

18:32.224 --> 18:39.213
As a child also, He was a very collective
personality.

18:39.414 --> 18:42.042
He actually emits collectiveness.

18:42.243 --> 18:48.056
The collective consciousness that you enjoy
is because of His bliss.

18:49.148 --> 19:00.131
I find that Americans are very collective
in the sense,

19:00.338 --> 19:04.840
they are more bothered about other
countries than about their own.

19:05.041 --> 19:13.210
They want to go all the way to Vietnam,
now to Iraq, now to some other place.

19:13.411 --> 19:18.891
Going all over the world, they try
to correct.

19:19.092 --> 19:27.252
But their own country they do not see
what's wrong. It's so divided.

19:28.085 --> 19:35.705
Mainly divided on race, racial
discrimination,

19:36.339 --> 19:45.269
is divided by religions and all of these
are just concepts

19:45.470 --> 19:50.856
which they have accepted and are fighting
among themselves.

19:53.654 --> 19:57.322
Now after all these,

19:59.032 --> 20:08.175
there are people who believe they are born
criminals and they should be criminals.

20:08.961 --> 20:15.357
And their criminality is going very far.

20:15.566 --> 20:23.381
They are gangsters. Even small children
have become gangsters.

20:23.582 --> 20:29.061
But the worst part is that the, these
little boys also,

20:29.262 --> 20:36.904
including others, all these criminals are
regarded as big heroes.

20:39.998 --> 20:48.041
I have seen once, a young boy wearing
a shirt

20:48.242 --> 20:52.332
with another young boy’s photograph
over it.

20:52.867 --> 20:56.242
So he told Me - I said, “Who is this?”
“You don’t know?

20:56.443 --> 20:59.638
Very famous gangster is he”, he said.

20:59.839 --> 21:03.537
At the age of thirteen years he is
a very famous gangster

21:03.738 --> 21:08.532
and this boy is very proudly putting up
that -

21:08.733 --> 21:15.288
like a big hero, or you can call it
like a God there.

21:17.952 --> 21:27.588
So see the perversion to what limit
Shri Krishna's blessings have been used.

21:27.916 --> 21:31.973
That's why this country is very difficult.

21:34.336 --> 21:41.243
One after another there has been attack
of negativity.

21:41.444 --> 21:46.403
For example, first thing started
by Christians,

21:46.604 --> 21:49.934
who said that Jews killed Christ.

21:50.135 --> 21:55.773
He never - It’s not true, it’s not true.
He was never killed by Jews.

21:55.974 --> 22:02.486
“Christ was killed by Jews”, is a false
statement, absolutely.

22:02.697 --> 22:10.715
Christ was not killed by Jews. How can
a multitude kill a man?

22:10.913 --> 22:21.770
It’s the law there. The Romans, or we can
call the Roman law crucified Him.

22:22.676 --> 22:29.604
So the Christians started nicely torturing
the Jews, because Christ was killed.

22:29.805 --> 22:35.921
I don’t know how to explain this such
absurd idea.

22:36.110 --> 22:42.663
Now somebody was killed so many years back,
and now what’s the use of killing

22:42.864 --> 22:48.634
some grandchildren of those people or great
grandchildren of those people?

22:48.835 --> 22:52.588
But they did not, the Jews did not.

22:54.464 --> 23:00.469
Still this concept was there that
the Jews killed.

23:00.882 --> 23:10.756
And the Christians felt they have a right
to torture the Jews.

23:10.957 --> 23:14.967
So when the Jews came here, they were
never given a good position,

23:15.168 --> 23:19.312
they were tortured very much and troubled
very much.

23:19.513 --> 23:24.122
It happened everywhere but very much
more here.

23:24.323 --> 23:30.796
So among Jews now came out some devils,
like Freud.

23:31.292 --> 23:43.107
And he said, “All right. We must shatter
these Christians absolutely.

23:43.417 --> 23:46.429
Their moral roots must be finished.”

23:46.630 --> 23:56.313
So he started his own psychology to destroy
the Christians.

23:56.534 --> 24:00.569
And Christians stupidly accepted.

24:01.339 --> 24:06.397
They did whatever he said,

24:06.987 --> 24:14.329
experimented whatever he did.

24:14.530 --> 24:22.623
When I was once in Switzerland, two girls
came and they were shaking in the program.

24:22.824 --> 24:27.204
I couldn't understand. I called them.
I said, "Why are you shaking?"

24:27.405 --> 24:41.342
So they said that, "Actually we are very
much degree holders in Freudian knowledge

24:41.543 --> 24:45.497
and we have done all experiments of Freud."

24:45.698 --> 24:52.648
“And then why are you shaking?” “Because
we have power to shake!” How about that?

24:55.669 --> 25:02.506
So they followed this Freud and this
vindictiveness that was there

25:02.707 --> 25:07.396
was not seen by anyone, even by Jews.

25:12.156 --> 25:20.154
As a result we had people who were deadly
against each other

25:20.355 --> 25:24.638
and ruining each other, destroying
each other.

25:27.856 --> 25:33.190
Then this Black and White business started.

25:34.328 --> 25:38.711
All kinds of theories people are putting up

25:39.066 --> 25:45.631
to show that the Blacks are bad or
the Whites are bad.

25:46.543 --> 25:50.234
The difference is only skin-deep.

25:50.760 --> 25:55.030
If you want you can cut the skin and see
for yourself.

25:55.339 --> 26:01.088
Inside body is the same. But it was so.

26:01.289 --> 26:09.649
This divisive method started and it's still
going on.

26:11.266 --> 26:21.455
I always say, without Blacks, Americans
will be left high and dry.

26:21.920 --> 26:25.292
Look at the talent they have.

26:26.355 --> 26:30.002
Not only music. Atlanta, I saw,

26:30.203 --> 26:36.259
all the Blacks were winning and Whites
were not anywhere. Just imagine.

26:36.460 --> 26:44.223
Very nicely they used to run, very swiftly
at the end of it, you see.

26:44.424 --> 26:46.788
And all the Whites were saying,
"Ha, ha, ha."

26:46.989 --> 26:50.795
They were nicely enjoying their position.

26:51.709 --> 26:55.585
You don't have the stamina of the Blacks
also.

26:56.861 --> 27:00.869
So in games also, same thing.

27:02.043 --> 27:05.381
With all this what is going to happen
to America?

27:05.582 --> 27:11.062
It's a country which has to be collective
because of Shri Krishna.

27:12.076 --> 27:16.885
All of them are immigrants here. Who is
not an immigrant?

27:17.086 --> 27:20.928
Whether they came earlier or later
doesn't matter.

27:21.129 --> 27:24.576
Thank God, I have told you many-a-times
that Columbus lost his way

27:24.777 --> 27:29.708
and came here, not to India. Otherwise,
there would have been no Indians left

27:29.909 --> 27:32.585
and no Sahaja Yoga.

27:34.228 --> 27:39.080
I think, it was the trick of Hanumana.

27:39.963 --> 27:45.387
He misled him and Columbus came here.
Thank God.

27:49.087 --> 27:56.691
Now, you are in a country where you have
to be collective.

27:57.532 --> 28:03.682
Krishna won't spare you unless and until
you are collective

28:03.883 --> 28:08.028
or you give up this nonsense of skin-deep
differences.

28:08.229 --> 28:19.713
Then religious differences. He had a friend
who was lame by one leg.

28:19.914 --> 28:23.619
He had some friends who were very black.

28:23.820 --> 28:28.917
He had some friends who were quite
Indian white, I should say.

28:29.118 --> 28:32.985
I shouldn’t say white like you people,
but Indian white.

28:33.216 --> 28:36.356
He had all kinds of colors.

28:36.557 --> 28:40.029
And He took His own birth in the Yadav
vansha.

28:40.230 --> 28:50.488
Though they were milk sellers, milkmen
who used to sell milk to people.

28:51.281 --> 28:58.024
He didn't take His birth in a very royal
family like Shri Rama.

28:58.225 --> 29:06.805
Though He was, because later on He became
the king of Dwarika.

29:07.559 --> 29:15.116
But in His style, in His behavior,
in His life,

29:15.418 --> 29:22.036
nobody could see that He was a royal
personality.

29:22.463 --> 29:25.650
He could sleep under a tree.

29:27.069 --> 29:30.565
He could eat anything that He could get.

29:30.766 --> 29:34.745
All kinds of sweet, sweet stories you can
read in His life,

29:34.946 --> 29:44.804
showing how He was enjoying His
collectivity, never showing off.

29:46.138 --> 29:53.200
And His collectivity has to be worked out
in this country.

29:53.401 --> 30:03.284
Unless and until it is done from your
heart, it's not going to work out.

30:05.773 --> 30:10.265
We had problems like this always with
our collectivity here.

30:10.466 --> 30:15.016
For example, a lady, you know, she is
a big lady, I think.

30:15.217 --> 30:18.070
She started correcting people: “Why do
you put here?

30:18.271 --> 30:22.195
This thing is getting dirty. That thing
is this and that.”

30:22.396 --> 30:29.520
Such a woman should be sometimes sent
to some stable to clean it.

30:29.721 --> 30:34.846
Then she will give up these nonsensical
ideas that she has.

30:35.186 --> 30:40.297
If you are a Sahaja Yogi you cannot behave
like this.

30:40.498 --> 30:45.539
And this kind of behavior can destroy
Sahaja Yoga.

30:45.944 --> 30:49.527
Have you ever heard Me saying that,
“This is dirty,

30:49.728 --> 30:55.264
this is not good, I don’t like this?”.
Did I say, ever?

31:00.492 --> 31:04.949
First of all, we have to understand,
if we have to be collective,

31:05.150 --> 31:09.954
we should give up these stupid ideas
about ourselves.

31:14.387 --> 31:19.888
Some people get some position, may be
some money,

31:20.089 --> 31:24.528
maybe, I would say, have a background.

31:24.729 --> 31:29.388
If you are sticking on to it then you are
not a Sahaja Yogi.

31:29.947 --> 31:32.716
You are saints!

31:35.170 --> 31:38.565
You cannot be demanding.

31:39.341 --> 31:44.840
You have to give, and give, and give.

31:45.164 --> 31:48.503
Whatever may be your position in life,

31:49.106 --> 31:54.786
if that can overpower you then you are
not a Sahaja Yogi at all.

31:59.714 --> 32:08.715
Shri Krishna, who is the Virat, who is
the great primordial personality,

32:09.774 --> 32:17.210
didn't show any such signs of His
greatness.

32:19.505 --> 32:22.313
But Americans have a speciality to show

32:22.514 --> 32:27.608
that they are something outstandingly
great.

32:28.495 --> 32:32.704
But Sahaja Yogis, please don't learn
those things.

32:32.905 --> 32:36.619
You have to make others unlearn.

32:40.402 --> 32:47.162
If that cannot happen, it's better to leave
Sahaja Yoga for ever.

32:49.401 --> 32:57.666
Such people will make everyone miserable
and destroy Sahaja Yoga in America.

32:59.108 --> 33:06.704
Even about protocol, you should become
timeless.

33:08.834 --> 33:11.979
Absolutely timeless.

33:12.187 --> 33:18.599
Now, if you are particular about time,
Shri Krishna will play His tricks

33:18.800 --> 33:24.959
and your timing will be finished.
Happened yesterday.

33:31.133 --> 33:37.551
So, one has to know that time is your slave

33:38.570 --> 33:44.540
and you don't have to be the slave
of time - if you are a Sahaja Yogi.

33:44.741 --> 33:51.677
Otherwise, you are not. That means
you are guided not by the Divine.

33:52.274 --> 33:58.531
The Divine works out everything very well.
But for whom? For Sahaja Yogis.

33:58.732 --> 34:03.285
But if you are not Sahaja Yogis,
you'll topple down.

34:07.119 --> 34:15.729
In every way we should find out what things
we have accumulated among ourselves

34:15.984 --> 34:19.335
which is not Shri Krishna's quality.

34:20.948 --> 34:30.931
Now, Shri Krishna used to steal as a child,
the butter from the ladies, why?

34:31.249 --> 34:37.638
Why did He steal the butter? Because
they were selling it

34:37.839 --> 34:45.753
to the military of Kamsa, His uncle,
who was a devil.

34:47.167 --> 34:52.085
They used to go all the way to sell him
in Mathura.

34:52.541 --> 34:58.466
So He used to steal it, because children
needed it, and giving it to children.

34:58.667 --> 35:03.510
He didn’t like this idea – why should it go

35:04.071 --> 35:12.316
to these horrible rakshasas of Mathura.

35:13.589 --> 35:16.916
Just the opposite in is America.

35:17.241 --> 35:24.479
All the false gurus, all the rakshasas come
here and they get all the butter.

35:28.401 --> 35:37.502
As if people have no brains to understand,

35:38.063 --> 35:44.134
while Shri Krishna is the brain
of the Virat.

35:44.856 --> 35:47.562
But here you find that people have
no brains.

35:47.763 --> 35:53.073
Anybody comes, says something, they:
“Ah, ha, ha, great.”

35:53.688 --> 35:56.243
Somebody talks big - all right.

35:56.444 --> 35:59.478
They’ll give away their money. They’ll give
away their houses.

35:59.679 --> 36:06.062
Their children they’ll remove from the
school – for something extremely stupid.

36:08.258 --> 36:15.279
While He is the brain in the body
of Virata.

36:16.602 --> 36:20.675
So this kind of brainlessness comes

36:21.381 --> 36:26.525
and we really start, even Sahaja Yogis
start behaving in a manner

36:26.726 --> 36:30.081
that shows they are really brainless.

36:36.362 --> 36:42.610
Apart from that, He is Kubera. He is
the God of wealth.

36:42.811 --> 36:46.658
That's why there is wealth in this country.

36:47.274 --> 36:50.266
But this wealth is all becoming debts,
you see,

36:50.467 --> 36:54.633
because of the special brains of Americans.

36:56.242 --> 37:00.498
They are so stupid that whatever is selling
in the market,

37:00.699 --> 37:02.908
whether they need it or not, they'll buy.

37:03.109 --> 37:07.063
Take loan, again take loan, take loan

37:07.264 --> 37:11.391
till they are absolutely indebted.

37:11.592 --> 37:18.876
Now here in the country of Kubera you
should be really rich.

37:19.077 --> 37:25.991
Rich doesn't mean just to have bank
balance, but means by temperament.

37:28.913 --> 37:31.879
Now it's much better but once upon a time,

37:32.080 --> 37:38.219
Americans were the most miserly
Sahaja Yogis.

37:38.716 --> 37:45.122
They used to send Me candles as present
and I used to hide that.

37:47.601 --> 37:51.302
I said, "Baba why do you send candles,
even? Don't send anything,

37:51.503 --> 37:54.617
because everybody is going to see
those candles

37:54.818 --> 37:59.196
and what are they going to say about it,
that candles have been sent."

38:00.861 --> 38:05.442
Now, this I am talking for introspection.

38:05.695 --> 38:15.666
Are we collective? Are we willing to share
everything that we have?

38:18.909 --> 38:24.320
Do we look down upon people who come
from other countries?

38:24.521 --> 38:28.022
Do we have racialism in us?

38:28.565 --> 38:31.479
Thirty-five Sahaja Yogis came from
Australia

38:31.680 --> 38:36.092
to America as if this is some Hajj.

38:36.293 --> 38:40.031
They went back with very bad vibrations.

38:40.610 --> 38:43.965
Out of them half were thrown out
of Sahaja Yoga.

38:44.166 --> 38:50.791
Imagine, Australia is the country where
they used to send all the criminals.

38:53.407 --> 39:00.150
So first and foremost, to judge yourself
is to see your vibrations.

39:01.022 --> 39:04.503
That you should meditate and judge
your vibrations

39:04.704 --> 39:08.743
if you are really collective or not.

39:10.916 --> 39:16.165
Because you are not like that, Sahaja Yoga
does not spread.

39:17.209 --> 39:22.335
I have seen people from Hare Rama
Hare Krishna.

39:26.571 --> 39:31.383
Poor things have found nothing. They get up
at four o'clock,

39:31.584 --> 39:37.423
start their Hare Rama Hare Krishna bhajan -
four o'clock. Alright.

39:37.624 --> 39:43.568
Then the whole day they wear a very thin
dhoti in which they are shivering.

39:43.749 --> 39:48.258
They shave their heads and put a very…

39:48.459 --> 39:53.125
pig’s tail here which is bought
in the market.

39:55.229 --> 39:59.728
If you see their dedication you'll be
surprised.

39:59.929 --> 40:07.299
How they are so much dedicated, when they
haven't found anything whatsoever?

40:07.778 --> 40:12.699
What about the nuns? You see them,
you’ll be amazed.

40:12.900 --> 40:18.814
One fellow came from the Catholic Church
to us.

40:19.015 --> 40:26.038
He was trying to be a priest. He said,
“Mother, Sahaja Yog –

40:26.239 --> 40:29.032
you don’t do anything, anything.” I said,
“What do you want to do?”

40:29.233 --> 40:35.777
“You know, there we could not eat any
meat on Fridays.

40:35.978 --> 40:40.552
On Saturdays, we could not drink anything.

40:40.753 --> 40:47.605
Then on Sundays, the whole day we had
to fast and pray to God."

40:47.806 --> 40:50.438
"Then - what about the rest of the time?"

40:50.639 --> 40:59.249
"The rest of the time, we had to remember
Bible by heart and then recite it.

40:59.450 --> 41:07.000
And if we made even one mistake, the father
would give us a nice beating.”

41:08.977 --> 41:16.837
That's another problem with Sahaja Yoga
because it is Shri Krishna's play.

41:17.694 --> 41:23.768
It's so simple. You don't have to do
anything of the kind.

41:24.625 --> 41:30.033
No disciplining, nothing. Left to you,
you are your own master.

41:30.234 --> 41:33.237
You are your own guru.

41:34.956 --> 41:38.154
But these things which are lingering
in your mind,

41:38.363 --> 41:41.835
which are just the opposite of Shri
Krishna’s life,

41:42.036 --> 41:45.155
which you have acquired in this country,

41:45.356 --> 41:50.004
are still there, here and there, here
and there left.

41:52.656 --> 42:00.520
Some of the people are really still
so much busy with themselves.

42:00.729 --> 42:06.678
They look so pale, thin – I tell you,
I can’t believe they are Sahaja Yogis.

42:10.867 --> 42:15.490
So when we see Shri Krishna's life,
the way He lived.

42:16.504 --> 42:23.632
And then He went to help the Pandavas.

42:25.055 --> 42:31.519
He told Arjuna that, "I can be your
charioteer.

42:31.720 --> 42:36.856
I can drive your chariot. But I will
not fight."

42:37.979 --> 42:43.716
Arjuna knew that He was all-powerful,
if He is there everything will work out.

42:44.060 --> 42:49.412
“And all My army I’ll give to Kauravas,
to seek the balance.”

42:50.137 --> 42:52.296
He said, "All right."

42:53.760 --> 42:59.288
He didn't fight to show off, I am this,
I am that.

42:59.489 --> 43:04.900
Like here: “Mother, I am the leader”.
Eh?

43:05.329 --> 43:10.461
“I am the leader.” “Can’t hear, I can’t
hear you.”

43:13.547 --> 43:16.801
"Mother, I am this."

43:17.408 --> 43:20.178
You are a Sahaja Yogi.

43:21.999 --> 43:26.056
It's a very great name that you have
achieved.

43:26.257 --> 43:34.192
The highest position you have achieved.
There’s nothing more to be achieved.

43:35.783 --> 43:39.874
Like somebody asked Me, “Mother,
the Indians in India never catch.

43:40.075 --> 43:44.884
Why do we go on catching all the time?”
I said, “Because Indians in India

43:45.085 --> 43:48.033
know they have achieved it now.
Nothing to be achieved.

43:48.234 --> 43:52.644
And you want to have God’s Realization –
I don’t know what other Realization.”

43:52.845 --> 43:55.760
They don't think like that.

43:56.717 --> 44:02.331
They say, "We have achieved now. We are
in the sea. It's for us to swim over."

44:06.872 --> 44:12.010
All these things some of you have crossed
over, some of you

44:12.211 --> 44:16.371
have absolutely lost them. But some of you
are still there.

44:16.587 --> 44:19.588
They are the most dangerous thing
as Christ has said,

44:19.789 --> 44:23.499
"Be careful of the murmuring souls."

44:28.812 --> 44:34.486
I don't know how to stop this little
rat-like people,

44:34.687 --> 44:38.394
who are cutting the nest of Sahaja Yoga.

44:40.489 --> 44:45.869
I've been reported about many and I am
really shocked.

44:46.070 --> 44:53.154
After so many years of My visit how can
people talk ill of each other

44:53.355 --> 44:56.539
and can create these problems?

44:59.171 --> 45:07.034
Shri Krishna's friendship is well known,
you know with Sudama how He behaved.

45:08.187 --> 45:17.097
All His beautiful manifestations must show
in your character.

45:17.298 --> 45:21.281
Then only this country can be saved.

45:21.482 --> 45:28.253
I must say it’s – now here we have Canada,
we have people also,

45:29.150 --> 45:37.995
I am told from Austria. From all over,
from England.

45:38.941 --> 45:44.788
But still, we are not so many people
as we should have been.

45:46.231 --> 45:50.725
If you just take Austrians, they must be
double of this.

45:52.297 --> 45:56.427
If they could do it, why can't we do it?

45:57.568 --> 46:04.747
Because we do not introspect and we do
not grow out of our egos.

46:05.814 --> 46:09.933
They will say that, "Why didn't Krishna
meditate?"

46:10.321 --> 46:13.739
You have to meditate on Shri Krishna.

46:13.940 --> 46:17.711
If He meditates what will happen
to you all?

46:24.434 --> 46:26.600
On the whole, I was very happy with
yesterday -

46:26.801 --> 46:34.986
the other day’s program, somehow.
Despite, as usual, in New York,

46:35.187 --> 46:44.410
our inability to really do good
advertising, unsystematic everything.

46:45.538 --> 46:51.217
Despite that we had so many people and
I put the responsibility on them.

46:51.418 --> 46:59.075
Because that's the thing - it is Shri
Krishna's responsibility.

46:59.667 --> 47:04.423
And that is what is your responsibility
now.

47:04.624 --> 47:14.954
You are responsible for America and Canada,
South America.

47:15.155 --> 47:20.575
You all are responsible and you people
should be such

47:20.776 --> 47:28.330
that people who see you, listen to you,
are with you,

47:28.531 --> 47:34.802
should know that these are the Gopa
and Gopis of Shri Krishna.

47:36.425 --> 47:42.192
Unless and until that thing happens, this
America is the most difficult place.

47:42.393 --> 47:46.742
Sometimes I feel it's not Gokul but
Mathura.

47:48.682 --> 47:53.183
So it is for you - and otherwise you cannot
enjoy.

47:53.384 --> 47:59.239
If you live with your all old clothes,
you can't enjoy.

48:01.041 --> 48:06.896
I must say this time there were so many
people and I have asked them to promise,

48:07.097 --> 48:16.427
and asked to put a bandhan on them, and I’m
sure they will try to keep My promise.

48:16.628 --> 48:21.674
I am sure. But it is you people who
disappoint them.

48:22.651 --> 48:26.458
When they see you, they are disappointed.

48:27.863 --> 48:31.438
Actually, here is the first time, Vishwa
Nirmala Dharm

48:31.639 --> 48:37.675
has been established as a religion.

48:39.927 --> 48:47.691
It is. But the rest of it is zero.

48:50.107 --> 48:57.047
So all these differences and divisiveness
has to finish

48:57.248 --> 49:03.563
and we should be one in the collective
nature of Shri Krishna.

49:07.386 --> 49:15.558
First, meditation is very important.
Introspection is very important.

49:16.676 --> 49:22.245
And also, meeting each other, talking
to each other,

49:22.446 --> 49:25.941
knowing each other is very important.

49:30.494 --> 49:34.285
It has worked all over. It’s worked out
in India tremendously,

49:34.486 --> 49:41.610
Russia tremendously, Bulgaria tremendously,
so why not here?

49:42.212 --> 49:47.398
It's no fashion for brainless people.

49:49.164 --> 49:57.687
It is a living process which has to take
place where you must mature.

49:57.878 --> 50:03.000
And what I find that Americans are
not matured.

50:03.741 --> 50:10.362
But you are now mature. You are now
mature people.

50:10.563 --> 50:16.490
And I hope you will all behave like mature
people henceforth.

50:17.873 --> 50:20.674
So may God bless you!

50:27.497 --> 50:29.996
(Aside to somebody) Can we have…?

50:35.528 --> 50:39.717
There are Shri Krishna's names they have
written down

50:39.918 --> 50:46.891
and I would request leaders to come
on the stage.

50:51.808 --> 50:57.359
Now try to understand every word, every
name of Shri Krishna.

51:06.883 --> 51:09.438
[Hindi]

51:16.803 --> 51:19.220
[Hindi]

51:22.283 --> 51:24.492
[Hindi]

51:25.732 --> 51:30.821
[Hindi]

51:32.437 --> 51:35.000
[Hindi]

51:43.547 --> 51:50.684
(Aside to a yogi) Also, you say the name
first, and then they will repeat it.

51:50.885 --> 51:54.536
Name and the meaning, and then
they will repeat it.

52:03.686 --> 52:06.130
You just move on.

52:06.989 --> 52:11.824
Yogi: Can we have the leaders of the
centers please come up to the stage?

52:12.025 --> 52:17.014
Shri Mataji: But are the… we didn’t have
the children’s thing.

52:19.114 --> 52:22.213
What about the children? Eh?

52:22.443 --> 52:27.209
We have here, they can also come.

52:30.603 --> 52:37.631
Firstly let us do little bit of Ganesh -
Ganesha Puja, then you’ll walk in.

52:38.617 --> 52:41.191
[Hindi]

52:41.876 --> 52:50.612
If there are children. Eh? [Hindi]

52:50.929 --> 52:53.429
Very few children there are.

52:53.630 --> 52:56.110
Yogi: Can we please have the children
up on the stage

52:56.311 --> 52:59.583
to do Ganesha, Shri Ganesha puja.

52:59.784 --> 53:02.311
[Hindi]

53:41.937 --> 53:45.470
Just a minute. Ganesha Mantra…

53:49.181 --> 53:53.399
What is there? (Unclear) Too vital!

53:53.600 --> 53:57.556
Yogi: Take the mantra to Shri Ganesha.
Shri Mataji: Ganesha mantra.

53:58.146 --> 54:02.307
Now. [Hindi]

54:09.189 --> 54:12.260
Just a minute, just a minute!

54:29.133 --> 54:32.086
[Hindi]

54:39.354 --> 54:45.433
Shri Mataji: Sing song of Ganesha’s.
Some Ganesha’s songs could we have.

54:46.625 --> 54:49.612
Yogi: Ganesh Sthuti.

54:57.487 --> 55:00.178
Shri Mataji: [Hindi]

55:01.294 --> 55:04.161
Yogi: Sanskrit 11.

59:16.328 --> 59:21.591
Yogi: We’ll take the 108 Names
of Shri Krishna.

59:22.104 --> 59:27.921
First we’ll say the name in Sanskrit,
then the meaning,

59:28.122 --> 59:31.705
and then we’ll take the mantra.

59:32.133 --> 59:37.024
[Recitation of 108 Names of Shri Krishna
begins. Not all of them are shown

pride in recognizing those contributions

02:01:54.038 --> 02:01:57.987

where Her meditation techniques
are practiced;

02:02:15.756 --> 02:02:19.120
And whereas, Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi

02:02:19.321 --> 02:02:23.792
was born in 1923 in Chhindwara,
India's center,

02:02:23.993 --> 02:02:28.358
and spent much of Her childhood in
the ashram of Mahatma Gandhi,

02:02:28.559 --> 02:02:33.771
who because of Her great spiritual gifts
consulted with Her frequently,

02:02:33.972 --> 02:02:38.926
as a young woman, She played an active role
in India's struggles for Independence

02:02:39.165 --> 02:02:43.367
from British colonial rule. And after
Independence was run,

02:02:43.568 --> 02:02:49.475
studied Medicine and Psychology, later
marrying Sir C.P. Srivastava,

02:02:49.676 --> 02:02:54.260
who served the Secretary General of the
United Nations Maritime Organisation

02:02:54.461 --> 02:02:57.413
for almost two decades...”
