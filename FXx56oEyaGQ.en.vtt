00:00:04.872 --> 00:00:10.618
1996-0929 Krishna Puja, Camp Vacamas,
New York, USA

00:08:17.685 --> 00:08:20.502
Shri Mataji: Wa wa wa.

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:03.402
Shri Mataji: Wa wa wa.

00:09:17.906 --> 00:09:22.485
Wa wa wa. Now. (Hindi)

00:09:28.877 --> 00:09:33.260
We are all sitting like a family sitting
together.

00:09:37.887 --> 00:09:42.730
There should be a show there, eh?...
Done very well.

00:10:02.538 --> 00:10:04.808
They’re from Vienna? …

00:10:11.018 --> 00:10:17.530
A composition which you yourself have
made it into dance - … wa wa.

00:10:17.984 --> 00:10:21.829
Bring her to Cabella. Yogi: Yes.
Yogini: Yes, Shri Mataji.

00:10:26.127 --> 00:10:31.179
Shri Mataji: Wa wa wa. Such a dancer,
she is a teacher also.

00:10:39.397 --> 00:10:44.198
I’ll take your leave, and I’ll try to come
to tomorrow’s program also]

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:19.702
[Hindi]

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:13.614
Today we have decided to have Krishna Puja

00:12:13.815 --> 00:12:19.439
because America is the Krishna bhoomi.

00:12:24.235 --> 00:12:30.590
It’s very surprising that such a great
incarnation of Shri Krishna

00:12:30.791 --> 00:12:42.568
came even much later than Rama and has
sent His special people to live in America.

00:12:43.972 --> 00:12:50.232
Of course, there are many who are seeking
in this country, no doubt.

00:12:50.433 --> 00:12:54.758
But there are many who are also misleading
them.

00:12:54.959 --> 00:13:04.067
That’s how you find, despite all our
effort, we have not been able

00:13:05.005 --> 00:13:09.579
to expand Sahaja Yoga very much.

00:13:12.922 --> 00:13:19.493
What one has to learn from His life
is very, very important.

00:13:19.686 --> 00:13:26.407
The first and foremost thing He taught
was collectivity.

00:13:27.432 --> 00:13:32.580
He used to get hold of small boys

00:13:34.947 --> 00:13:39.310
and play with them together.

00:13:42.282 --> 00:13:45.356
Rama didn't do that.

00:13:46.428 --> 00:13:51.354
He used to get hold of ladies

00:13:51.623 --> 00:14:00.824
who were selling milk and also butter,

00:14:01.036 --> 00:14:09.071
those who used to go to fill their waters -
water in the pitcher.

00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:22.196
He is the one who collected all such people
in the village of Gokul.

00:14:24.034 --> 00:14:33.456
He played all kinds of pranks on His
friends

00:14:33.657 --> 00:14:40.002
and His mother and the mother’s friends.

00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:45.500
Behaved just like a very naughty child,

00:14:46.533 --> 00:14:54.120
ust to show that He was just like
all of us.

00:14:55.445 --> 00:15:00.525
As you know, He was the incarnation
of Shri Vishnu.

00:15:00.726 --> 00:15:11.144
First Shri Rama was born, took incarnation
as Shri Rama,

00:15:11.679 --> 00:15:20.025
which was in the Aryan race, means that
time we had

00:15:20.226 --> 00:15:29.573
an Aryan race which was sort of superior,
superior race than others.

00:15:29.774 --> 00:15:36.758
But when He came as Krishna, He took
His birth

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:44.217
in Yadav dynasty, you can call it.

00:15:44.418 --> 00:15:52.686
They were not superior, they were selling
milk, having cowherds

00:15:52.887 --> 00:16:02.834
and doing work not of any religious style.

00:16:03.232 --> 00:16:09.030
But they were innocent simple people
living in the villages,

00:16:09.231 --> 00:16:17.707
and they saw the great miracles
of Shri Krishna’s childhood.

00:16:17.908 --> 00:16:22.667
He killed demons. He killed Pootana.

00:16:22.868 --> 00:16:29.799
All these people were sent by His uncle
Kamsa to kill him.

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:38.071
It was to be, because He had to prove that
He was the incarnation

00:16:38.272 --> 00:16:41.604
of Shri Vishnu and He did it.

00:16:41.805 --> 00:16:47.284
As a child, how He killed those people
is remarkable.

00:16:47.485 --> 00:16:52.990
And how He made them out though they were
all camouflaged.

00:16:57.084 --> 00:17:00.936
n these modern times, difficult for people
to believe

00:17:01.137 --> 00:17:07.260
that there could have been any incarnation
like Shri Krishna.

00:17:07.562 --> 00:17:18.445
But in Sahaja Yoga, we have method
of absolutely establishing the truth

00:17:18.646 --> 00:17:24.261
that Shri Krishna was there ruling
on the Vishuddhi chakra.

00:17:25.122 --> 00:17:29.736
From His childhood, you can see He was
fond of collectivity.

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:34.825
And He tried to create collectivity
of people

00:17:35.026 --> 00:17:41.479
who were very simple, uneducated,
good-hearted people.

00:17:41.804 --> 00:17:45.758
And that is His special quality.

00:17:45.959 --> 00:17:54.149
And all the people of that village knew Him
very well, all cared for Him.

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:57.870
And when He had to go,

00:17:58.679 --> 00:18:05.596
they felt very sad and all of them came
running and crying for Him.

00:18:05.796 --> 00:18:09.602
It was a small boy who was going.

00:18:09.803 --> 00:18:15.997
After all, what is there? A little boy
from the village is going.

00:18:16.198 --> 00:18:20.838
The whole village had gathered
to cry for Him.

00:18:27.639 --> 00:18:32.023
That is what we all Sahaja Yogis have
to know.

00:18:32.224 --> 00:18:39.213
As a child also, He was a very collective
personality.

00:18:39.414 --> 00:18:42.042
He actually emits collectiveness.

00:18:42.243 --> 00:18:48.056
The collective consciousness that you enjoy
is because of His bliss.

00:18:49.148 --> 00:19:00.131
I find that Americans are very collective
in the sense,

00:19:00.338 --> 00:19:04.840
they are more bothered about other
countries than about their own.

00:19:05.041 --> 00:19:13.210
They want to go all the way to Vietnam,
now to Iraq, now to some other place.

00:19:13.411 --> 00:19:18.891
Going all over the world, they try
to correct.

00:19:19.092 --> 00:19:27.252
But their own country they do not see
what's wrong. It's so divided.

00:19:28.085 --> 00:19:35.705
Mainly divided on race, racial
discrimination,

00:19:36.339 --> 00:19:45.269
is divided by religions and all of these
are just concepts

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:50.856
which they have accepted and are fighting
among themselves.

00:19:53.654 --> 00:19:57.322
Now after all these,

00:19:59.032 --> 00:20:08.175
there are people who believe they are born
criminals and they should be criminals.

00:20:08.961 --> 00:20:15.357
And their criminality is going very far.

00:20:15.566 --> 00:20:23.381
They are gangsters. Even small children
have become gangsters.

00:20:23.582 --> 00:20:29.061
But the worst part is that the, these
little boys also,

00:20:29.262 --> 00:20:36.904
including others, all these criminals are
regarded as big heroes.

00:20:39.998 --> 00:20:48.041
I have seen once, a young boy wearing
a shirt

00:20:48.242 --> 00:20:52.332
with another young boy’s photograph
over it.

00:20:52.867 --> 00:20:56.242
So he told Me - I said, “Who is this?”
“You don’t know?

00:20:56.443 --> 00:20:59.638
Very famous gangster is he”, he said.

00:20:59.839 --> 00:21:03.537
At the age of thirteen years he is
a very famous gangster

00:21:03.738 --> 00:21:08.532
and this boy is very proudly putting up
that -

00:21:08.733 --> 00:21:15.288
like a big hero, or you can call it
like a God there.

00:21:17.952 --> 00:21:27.588
So see the perversion to what limit
Shri Krishna's blessings have been used.

00:21:27.916 --> 00:21:31.973
That's why this country is very difficult.

00:21:34.336 --> 00:21:41.243
One after another there has been attack
of negativity.

00:21:41.444 --> 00:21:46.403
For example, first thing started
by Christians,

00:21:46.604 --> 00:21:49.934
who said that Jews killed Christ.

00:21:50.135 --> 00:21:55.773
He never - It’s not true, it’s not true.
He was never killed by Jews.

00:21:55.974 --> 00:22:02.486
“Christ was killed by Jews”, is a false
statement, absolutely.

00:22:02.697 --> 00:22:10.715
Christ was not killed by Jews. How can
a multitude kill a man?

00:22:10.913 --> 00:22:21.770
It’s the law there. The Romans, or we can
call the Roman law crucified Him.

00:22:22.676 --> 00:22:29.604
So the Christians started nicely torturing
the Jews, because Christ was killed.

00:22:29.805 --> 00:22:35.921
I don’t know how to explain this such
absurd idea.

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:42.663
Now somebody was killed so many years back,
and now what’s the use of killing

00:22:42.864 --> 00:22:48.634
some grandchildren of those people or great
grandchildren of those people?

00:22:48.835 --> 00:22:52.588
But they did not, the Jews did not.

00:22:54.464 --> 00:23:00.469
Still this concept was there that
the Jews killed.

00:23:00.882 --> 00:23:10.756
And the Christians felt they have a right
to torture the Jews.

00:23:10.957 --> 00:23:14.967
So when the Jews came here, they were
never given a good position,

00:23:15.168 --> 00:23:19.312
they were tortured very much and troubled
very much.

00:23:19.513 --> 00:23:24.122
It happened everywhere but very much
more here.

00:23:24.323 --> 00:23:30.796
So among Jews now came out some devils,
like Freud.

00:23:31.292 --> 00:23:43.107
And he said, “All right. We must shatter
these Christians absolutely.

00:23:43.417 --> 00:23:46.429
Their moral roots must be finished.”

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:56.313
So he started his own psychology to destroy
the Christians.

00:23:56.534 --> 00:24:00.569
And Christians stupidly accepted.

00:24:01.339 --> 00:24:06.397
They did whatever he said,

00:24:06.987 --> 00:24:14.329
experimented whatever he did.

00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:22.623
When I was once in Switzerland, two girls
came and they were shaking in the program.

00:24:22.824 --> 00:24:27.204
I couldn't understand. I called them.
I said, "Why are you shaking?"

00:24:27.405 --> 00:24:41.342
So they said that, "Actually we are very
much degree holders in Freudian knowledge

00:24:41.543 --> 00:24:45.497
and we have done all experiments of Freud."

00:24:45.698 --> 00:24:52.648
“And then why are you shaking?” “Because
we have power to shake!” How about that?

00:24:55.669 --> 00:25:02.506
So they followed this Freud and this
vindictiveness that was there

00:25:02.707 --> 00:25:07.396
was not seen by anyone, even by Jews.

00:25:12.156 --> 00:25:20.154
As a result we had people who were deadly
against each other

00:25:20.355 --> 00:25:24.638
and ruining each other, destroying
each other.

00:25:27.856 --> 00:25:33.190
Then this Black and White business started.

00:25:34.328 --> 00:25:38.711
All kinds of theories people are putting up

00:25:39.066 --> 00:25:45.631
to show that the Blacks are bad or
the Whites are bad.

00:25:46.543 --> 00:25:50.234
The difference is only skin-deep.

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:55.030
If you want you can cut the skin and see
for yourself.

00:25:55.339 --> 00:26:01.088
Inside body is the same. But it was so.

00:26:01.289 --> 00:26:09.649
This divisive method started and it's still
going on.

00:26:11.266 --> 00:26:21.455
I always say, without Blacks, Americans
will be left high and dry.

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:25.292
Look at the talent they have.

00:26:26.355 --> 00:26:30.002
Not only music. Atlanta, I saw,

00:26:30.203 --> 00:26:36.259
all the Blacks were winning and Whites
were not anywhere. Just imagine.

00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:44.223
Very nicely they used to run, very swiftly
at the end of it, you see.

00:26:44.424 --> 00:26:46.788
And all the Whites were saying,
"Ha, ha, ha."

00:26:46.989 --> 00:26:50.795
They were nicely enjoying their position.

00:26:51.709 --> 00:26:55.585
You don't have the stamina of the Blacks
also.

00:26:56.861 --> 00:27:00.869
So in games also, same thing.

00:27:02.043 --> 00:27:05.381
With all this what is going to happen
to America?

00:27:05.582 --> 00:27:11.062
It's a country which has to be collective
because of Shri Krishna.

00:27:12.076 --> 00:27:16.885
All of them are immigrants here. Who is
not an immigrant?

00:27:17.086 --> 00:27:20.928
Whether they came earlier or later
doesn't matter.

00:27:21.129 --> 00:27:24.576
Thank God, I have told you many-a-times
that Columbus lost his way

00:27:24.777 --> 00:27:29.708
and came here, not to India. Otherwise,
there would have been no Indians left

00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:32.585
and no Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:34.228 --> 00:27:39.080
I think, it was the trick of Hanumana.

00:27:39.963 --> 00:27:45.387
He misled him and Columbus came here.
Thank God.

00:27:49.087 --> 00:27:56.691
Now, you are in a country where you have
to be collective.

00:27:57.532 --> 00:28:03.682
Krishna won't spare you unless and until
you are collective

00:28:03.883 --> 00:28:08.028
or you give up this nonsense of skin-deep
differences.

00:28:08.229 --> 00:28:19.713
Then religious differences. He had a friend
who was lame by one leg.

00:28:19.914 --> 00:28:23.619
He had some friends who were very black.

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:28.917
He had some friends who were quite
Indian white, I should say.

00:28:29.118 --> 00:28:32.985
I shouldn’t say white like you people,
but Indian white.

00:28:33.216 --> 00:28:36.356
He had all kinds of colors.

00:28:36.557 --> 00:28:40.029
And He took His own birth in the Yadav
vansha.

00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:50.488
Though they were milk sellers, milkmen
who used to sell milk to people.

00:28:51.281 --> 00:28:58.024
He didn't take His birth in a very royal
family like Shri Rama.

00:28:58.225 --> 00:29:06.805
Though He was, because later on He became
the king of Dwarika.

00:29:07.559 --> 00:29:15.116
But in His style, in His behavior,
in His life,

00:29:15.418 --> 00:29:22.036
nobody could see that He was a royal
personality.

00:29:22.463 --> 00:29:25.650
He could sleep under a tree.

00:29:27.069 --> 00:29:30.565
He could eat anything that He could get.

00:29:30.766 --> 00:29:34.745
All kinds of sweet, sweet stories you can
read in His life,

00:29:34.946 --> 00:29:44.804
showing how He was enjoying His
collectivity, never showing off.

00:29:46.138 --> 00:29:53.200
And His collectivity has to be worked out
in this country.

00:29:53.401 --> 00:30:03.284
Unless and until it is done from your
heart, it's not going to work out.

00:30:05.773 --> 00:30:10.265
We had problems like this always with
our collectivity here.

00:30:10.466 --> 00:30:15.016
For example, a lady, you know, she is
a big lady, I think.

00:30:15.217 --> 00:30:18.070
She started correcting people: “Why do
you put here?

00:30:18.271 --> 00:30:22.195
This thing is getting dirty. That thing
is this and that.”

00:30:22.396 --> 00:30:29.520
Such a woman should be sometimes sent
to some stable to clean it.

00:30:29.721 --> 00:30:34.846
Then she will give up these nonsensical
ideas that she has.

00:30:35.186 --> 00:30:40.297
If you are a Sahaja Yogi you cannot behave
like this.

00:30:40.498 --> 00:30:45.539
And this kind of behavior can destroy
Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:45.944 --> 00:30:49.527
Have you ever heard Me saying that,
“This is dirty,

00:30:49.728 --> 00:30:55.264
this is not good, I don’t like this?”.
Did I say, ever?

00:31:00.492 --> 00:31:04.949
First of all, we have to understand,
if we have to be collective,

00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:09.954
we should give up these stupid ideas
about ourselves.

00:31:14.387 --> 00:31:19.888
Some people get some position, may be
some money,

00:31:20.089 --> 00:31:24.528
maybe, I would say, have a background.

00:31:24.729 --> 00:31:29.388
If you are sticking on to it then you are
not a Sahaja Yogi.

00:31:29.947 --> 00:31:32.716
You are saints!

00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:38.565
You cannot be demanding.

00:31:39.341 --> 00:31:44.840
You have to give, and give, and give.

00:31:45.164 --> 00:31:48.503
Whatever may be your position in life,

00:31:49.106 --> 00:31:54.786
if that can overpower you then you are
not a Sahaja Yogi at all.

00:31:59.714 --> 00:32:08.715
Shri Krishna, who is the Virat, who is
the great primordial personality,

00:32:09.774 --> 00:32:17.210
didn't show any such signs of His
greatness.

00:32:19.505 --> 00:32:22.313
But Americans have a speciality to show

00:32:22.514 --> 00:32:27.608
that they are something outstandingly
great.

00:32:28.495 --> 00:32:32.704
But Sahaja Yogis, please don't learn
those things.

00:32:32.905 --> 00:32:36.619
You have to make others unlearn.

00:32:40.402 --> 00:32:47.162
If that cannot happen, it's better to leave
Sahaja Yoga for ever.

00:32:49.401 --> 00:32:57.666
Such people will make everyone miserable
and destroy Sahaja Yoga in America.

00:32:59.108 --> 00:33:06.704
Even about protocol, you should become
timeless.

00:33:08.834 --> 00:33:11.979
Absolutely timeless.

00:33:12.187 --> 00:33:18.599
Now, if you are particular about time,
Shri Krishna will play His tricks

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:24.959
and your timing will be finished.
Happened yesterday.

00:33:31.133 --> 00:33:37.551
So, one has to know that time is your slave

00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:44.540
and you don't have to be the slave
of time - if you are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:33:44.741 --> 00:33:51.677
Otherwise, you are not. That means
you are guided not by the Divine.

00:33:52.274 --> 00:33:58.531
The Divine works out everything very well.
But for whom? For Sahaja Yogis.

00:33:58.732 --> 00:34:03.285
But if you are not Sahaja Yogis,
you'll topple down.

00:34:07.119 --> 00:34:15.729
In every way we should find out what things
we have accumulated among ourselves

00:34:15.984 --> 00:34:19.335
which is not Shri Krishna's quality.

00:34:20.948 --> 00:34:30.931
Now, Shri Krishna used to steal as a child,
the butter from the ladies, why?

00:34:31.249 --> 00:34:37.638
Why did He steal the butter? Because
they were selling it

00:34:37.839 --> 00:34:45.753
to the military of Kamsa, His uncle,
who was a devil.

00:34:47.167 --> 00:34:52.085
They used to go all the way to sell him
in Mathura.

00:34:52.541 --> 00:34:58.466
So He used to steal it, because children
needed it, and giving it to children.

00:34:58.667 --> 00:35:03.510
He didn’t like this idea – why should it go

00:35:04.071 --> 00:35:12.316
to these horrible rakshasas of Mathura.

00:35:13.589 --> 00:35:16.916
Just the opposite in is America.

00:35:17.241 --> 00:35:24.479
All the false gurus, all the rakshasas come
here and they get all the butter.

00:35:28.401 --> 00:35:37.502
As if people have no brains to understand,

00:35:38.063 --> 00:35:44.134
while Shri Krishna is the brain
of the Virat.

00:35:44.856 --> 00:35:47.562
But here you find that people have
no brains.

00:35:47.763 --> 00:35:53.073
Anybody comes, says something, they:
“Ah, ha, ha, great.”

00:35:53.688 --> 00:35:56.243
Somebody talks big - all right.

00:35:56.444 --> 00:35:59.478
They’ll give away their money. They’ll give
away their houses.

00:35:59.679 --> 00:36:06.062
Their children they’ll remove from the
school – for something extremely stupid.

00:36:08.258 --> 00:36:15.279
While He is the brain in the body
of Virata.

00:36:16.602 --> 00:36:20.675
So this kind of brainlessness comes

00:36:21.381 --> 00:36:26.525
and we really start, even Sahaja Yogis
start behaving in a manner

00:36:26.726 --> 00:36:30.081
that shows they are really brainless.

00:36:36.362 --> 00:36:42.610
Apart from that, He is Kubera. He is
the God of wealth.

00:36:42.811 --> 00:36:46.658
That's why there is wealth in this country.

00:36:47.274 --> 00:36:50.266
But this wealth is all becoming debts,
you see,

00:36:50.467 --> 00:36:54.633
because of the special brains of Americans.

00:36:56.242 --> 00:37:00.498
They are so stupid that whatever is selling
in the market,

00:37:00.699 --> 00:37:02.908
whether they need it or not, they'll buy.

00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:07.063
Take loan, again take loan, take loan

00:37:07.264 --> 00:37:11.391
till they are absolutely indebted.

00:37:11.592 --> 00:37:18.876
Now here in the country of Kubera you
should be really rich.

00:37:19.077 --> 00:37:25.991
Rich doesn't mean just to have bank
balance, but means by temperament.

00:37:28.913 --> 00:37:31.879
Now it's much better but once upon a time,

00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:38.219
Americans were the most miserly
Sahaja Yogis.

00:37:38.716 --> 00:37:45.122
They used to send Me candles as present
and I used to hide that.

00:37:47.601 --> 00:37:51.302
I said, "Baba why do you send candles,
even? Don't send anything,

00:37:51.503 --> 00:37:54.617
because everybody is going to see
those candles

00:37:54.818 --> 00:37:59.196
and what are they going to say about it,
that candles have been sent."

00:38:00.861 --> 00:38:05.442
Now, this I am talking for introspection.

00:38:05.695 --> 00:38:15.666
Are we collective? Are we willing to share
everything that we have?

00:38:18.909 --> 00:38:24.320
Do we look down upon people who come
from other countries?

00:38:24.521 --> 00:38:28.022
Do we have racialism in us?

00:38:28.565 --> 00:38:31.479
Thirty-five Sahaja Yogis came from
Australia

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:36.092
to America as if this is some Hajj.

00:38:36.293 --> 00:38:40.031
They went back with very bad vibrations.

00:38:40.610 --> 00:38:43.965
Out of them half were thrown out
of Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:44.166 --> 00:38:50.791
Imagine, Australia is the country where
they used to send all the criminals.

00:38:53.407 --> 00:39:00.150
So first and foremost, to judge yourself
is to see your vibrations.

00:39:01.022 --> 00:39:04.503
That you should meditate and judge
your vibrations

00:39:04.704 --> 00:39:08.743
if you are really collective or not.

00:39:10.916 --> 00:39:16.165
Because you are not like that, Sahaja Yoga
does not spread.

00:39:17.209 --> 00:39:22.335
I have seen people from Hare Rama
Hare Krishna.

00:39:26.571 --> 00:39:31.383
Poor things have found nothing. They get up
at four o'clock,

00:39:31.584 --> 00:39:37.423
start their Hare Rama Hare Krishna bhajan -
four o'clock. Alright.

00:39:37.624 --> 00:39:43.568
Then the whole day they wear a very thin
dhoti in which they are shivering.

00:39:43.749 --> 00:39:48.258
They shave their heads and put a very…

00:39:48.459 --> 00:39:53.125
pig’s tail here which is bought
in the market.

00:39:55.229 --> 00:39:59.728
If you see their dedication you'll be
surprised.

00:39:59.929 --> 00:40:07.299
How they are so much dedicated, when they
haven't found anything whatsoever?

00:40:07.778 --> 00:40:12.699
What about the nuns? You see them,
you’ll be amazed.

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:18.814
One fellow came from the Catholic Church
to us.

00:40:19.015 --> 00:40:26.038
He was trying to be a priest. He said,
“Mother, Sahaja Yog –

00:40:26.239 --> 00:40:29.032
you don’t do anything, anything.” I said,
“What do you want to do?”

00:40:29.233 --> 00:40:35.777
“You know, there we could not eat any
meat on Fridays.

00:40:35.978 --> 00:40:40.552
On Saturdays, we could not drink anything.

00:40:40.753 --> 00:40:47.605
Then on Sundays, the whole day we had
to fast and pray to God."

00:40:47.806 --> 00:40:50.438
"Then - what about the rest of the time?"

00:40:50.639 --> 00:40:59.249
"The rest of the time, we had to remember
Bible by heart and then recite it.

00:40:59.450 --> 00:41:07.000
And if we made even one mistake, the father
would give us a nice beating.”

00:41:08.977 --> 00:41:16.837
That's another problem with Sahaja Yoga
because it is Shri Krishna's play.

00:41:17.694 --> 00:41:23.768
It's so simple. You don't have to do
anything of the kind.

00:41:24.625 --> 00:41:30.033
No disciplining, nothing. Left to you,
you are your own master.

00:41:30.234 --> 00:41:33.237
You are your own guru.

00:41:34.956 --> 00:41:38.154
But these things which are lingering
in your mind,

00:41:38.363 --> 00:41:41.835
which are just the opposite of Shri
Krishna’s life,

00:41:42.036 --> 00:41:45.155
which you have acquired in this country,

00:41:45.356 --> 00:41:50.004
are still there, here and there, here
and there left.

00:41:52.656 --> 00:42:00.520
Some of the people are really still
so much busy with themselves.

00:42:00.729 --> 00:42:06.678
They look so pale, thin – I tell you,
I can’t believe they are Sahaja Yogis.

00:42:10.867 --> 00:42:15.490
So when we see Shri Krishna's life,
the way He lived.

00:42:16.504 --> 00:42:23.632
And then He went to help the Pandavas.

00:42:25.055 --> 00:42:31.519
He told Arjuna that, "I can be your
charioteer.

00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:36.856
I can drive your chariot. But I will
not fight."

00:42:37.979 --> 00:42:43.716
Arjuna knew that He was all-powerful,
if He is there everything will work out.

00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:49.412
“And all My army I’ll give to Kauravas,
to seek the balance.”

00:42:50.137 --> 00:42:52.296
He said, "All right."

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:59.288
He didn't fight to show off, I am this,
I am that.

00:42:59.489 --> 00:43:04.900
Like here: “Mother, I am the leader”.
Eh?

00:43:05.329 --> 00:43:10.461
“I am the leader.” “Can’t hear, I can’t
hear you.”

00:43:13.547 --> 00:43:16.801
"Mother, I am this."

00:43:17.408 --> 00:43:20.178
You are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:43:21.999 --> 00:43:26.056
It's a very great name that you have
achieved.

00:43:26.257 --> 00:43:34.192
The highest position you have achieved.
There’s nothing more to be achieved.

00:43:35.783 --> 00:43:39.874
Like somebody asked Me, “Mother,
the Indians in India never catch.

00:43:40.075 --> 00:43:44.884
Why do we go on catching all the time?”
I said, “Because Indians in India

00:43:45.085 --> 00:43:48.033
know they have achieved it now.
Nothing to be achieved.

00:43:48.234 --> 00:43:52.644
And you want to have God’s Realization –
I don’t know what other Realization.”

00:43:52.845 --> 00:43:55.760
They don't think like that.

00:43:56.717 --> 00:44:02.331
They say, "We have achieved now. We are
in the sea. It's for us to swim over."

00:44:06.872 --> 00:44:12.010
All these things some of you have crossed
over, some of you

00:44:12.211 --> 00:44:16.371
have absolutely lost them. But some of you
are still there.

00:44:16.587 --> 00:44:19.588
They are the most dangerous thing
as Christ has said,

00:44:19.789 --> 00:44:23.499
"Be careful of the murmuring souls."

00:44:28.812 --> 00:44:34.486
I don't know how to stop this little
rat-like people,

00:44:34.687 --> 00:44:38.394
who are cutting the nest of Sahaja Yoga.

00:44:40.489 --> 00:44:45.869
I've been reported about many and I am
really shocked.

00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:53.154
After so many years of My visit how can
people talk ill of each other

00:44:53.355 --> 00:44:56.539
and can create these problems?

00:44:59.171 --> 00:45:07.034
Shri Krishna's friendship is well known,
you know with Sudama how He behaved.

00:45:08.187 --> 00:45:17.097
All His beautiful manifestations must show
in your character.

00:45:17.298 --> 00:45:21.281
Then only this country can be saved.

00:45:21.482 --> 00:45:28.253
I must say it’s – now here we have Canada,
we have people also,

00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:37.995
I am told from Austria. From all over,
from England.

00:45:38.941 --> 00:45:44.788
But still, we are not so many people
as we should have been.

00:45:46.231 --> 00:45:50.725
If you just take Austrians, they must be
double of this.

00:45:52.297 --> 00:45:56.427
If they could do it, why can't we do it?

00:45:57.568 --> 00:46:04.747
Because we do not introspect and we do
not grow out of our egos.

00:46:05.814 --> 00:46:09.933
They will say that, "Why didn't Krishna
meditate?"

00:46:10.321 --> 00:46:13.739
You have to meditate on Shri Krishna.

00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:17.711
If He meditates what will happen
to you all?

00:46:24.434 --> 00:46:26.600
On the whole, I was very happy with
yesterday -

00:46:26.801 --> 00:46:34.986
the other day’s program, somehow.
Despite, as usual, in New York,

00:46:35.187 --> 00:46:44.410
our inability to really do good
advertising, unsystematic everything.

00:46:45.538 --> 00:46:51.217
Despite that we had so many people and
I put the responsibility on them.

00:46:51.418 --> 00:46:59.075
Because that's the thing - it is Shri
Krishna's responsibility.

00:46:59.667 --> 00:47:04.423
And that is what is your responsibility
now.

00:47:04.624 --> 00:47:14.954
You are responsible for America and Canada,
South America.

00:47:15.155 --> 00:47:20.575
You all are responsible and you people
should be such

00:47:20.776 --> 00:47:28.330
that people who see you, listen to you,
are with you,

00:47:28.531 --> 00:47:34.802
should know that these are the Gopa
and Gopis of Shri Krishna.

00:47:36.425 --> 00:47:42.192
Unless and until that thing happens, this
America is the most difficult place.

00:47:42.393 --> 00:47:46.742
Sometimes I feel it's not Gokul but
Mathura.

00:47:48.682 --> 00:47:53.183
So it is for you - and otherwise you cannot
enjoy.

00:47:53.384 --> 00:47:59.239
If you live with your all old clothes,
you can't enjoy.

00:48:01.041 --> 00:48:06.896
I must say this time there were so many
people and I have asked them to promise,

00:48:07.097 --> 00:48:16.427
and asked to put a bandhan on them, and I’m
sure they will try to keep My promise.

00:48:16.628 --> 00:48:21.674
I am sure. But it is you people who
disappoint them.

00:48:22.651 --> 00:48:26.458
When they see you, they are disappointed.

00:48:27.863 --> 00:48:31.438
Actually, here is the first time, Vishwa
Nirmala Dharm

00:48:31.639 --> 00:48:37.675
has been established as a religion.

00:48:39.927 --> 00:48:47.691
It is. But the rest of it is zero.

00:48:50.107 --> 00:48:57.047
So all these differences and divisiveness
has to finish

00:48:57.248 --> 00:49:03.563
and we should be one in the collective
nature of Shri Krishna.

00:49:07.386 --> 00:49:15.558
First, meditation is very important.
Introspection is very important.

00:49:16.676 --> 00:49:22.245
And also, meeting each other, talking
to each other,

00:49:22.446 --> 00:49:25.941
knowing each other is very important.

00:49:30.494 --> 00:49:34.285
It has worked all over. It’s worked out
in India tremendously,

00:49:34.486 --> 00:49:41.610
Russia tremendously, Bulgaria tremendously,
so why not here?

00:49:42.212 --> 00:49:47.398
It's no fashion for brainless people.

00:49:49.164 --> 00:49:57.687
It is a living process which has to take
place where you must mature.

00:49:57.878 --> 00:50:03.000
And what I find that Americans are
not matured.

00:50:03.741 --> 00:50:10.362
But you are now mature. You are now
mature people.

00:50:10.563 --> 00:50:16.490
And I hope you will all behave like mature
people henceforth.

00:50:17.873 --> 00:50:20.674
So may God bless you!

00:50:27.497 --> 00:50:29.996
(Aside to somebody) Can we have…?

00:50:35.528 --> 00:50:39.717
There are Shri Krishna's names they have
written down

00:50:39.918 --> 00:50:46.891
and I would request leaders to come
on the stage.

00:50:51.808 --> 00:50:57.359
Now try to understand every word, every
name of Shri Krishna.

was born in 1923 in Chhindwara,
India's center,

consulted with Her frequently,

as a young woman, She played an active role
in India's struggles for Independence

02:02:39.165 --> 02:02:43.367
