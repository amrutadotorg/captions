03:19.782 --> 03:23.680
Today we have gathered here

03:23.880 --> 03:31.810
to do the Puja to Sadashiva.

03:37.050 --> 03:43.890
The One, which is reflected within us,
is the Shiva,

03:44.090 --> 03:49.204
which is the pure Spirit.

03:52.193 --> 03:57.590
This pure Spirit within us is
the reflection

03:57.790 --> 04:02.503
of God Almighty, Sadashiva.

04:05.914 --> 04:15.864
It’s like the sun that falls in the water

04:16.065 --> 04:21.905
and gives a clear reflection.

04:22.210 --> 04:27.370
Or else it falls on the stone,

04:27.571 --> 04:31.995
it doesn’t give any reflection at all.

04:32.270 --> 04:35.925
If you have, say, the mirror,

04:36.126 --> 04:41.259
the sun will not only fall on the mirror

04:41.483 --> 04:48.187
but will reflect back its light.

04:49.072 --> 04:53.019
In the same way in the human beings

04:53.220 --> 05:05.369
the reflection of God Almighty is expressed
in the way your personality is.

05:05.570 --> 05:11.980
If your personality is clean and clear,
innocent,

05:12.181 --> 05:17.370
then the reflection could be like a mirror.

05:18.410 --> 05:28.200
Thus the saintly people, they reflect God
Almighty in the proper manner,

05:28.401 --> 05:36.886
in the sense that their own identification
with wrong things is no more.

05:37.087 --> 05:41.068
When there is no such identification

05:41.283 --> 05:48.930
and when a person is absolutely the pure
Spirit,

05:49.130 --> 05:55.280
then the reflection of God reflects into
others.

05:55.480 --> 06:01.933
Luckily you all have got your Self
Realization.

06:02.134 --> 06:05.839
That means the reflection of God Almighty

06:06.040 --> 06:10.459
is already working into your attention.

06:10.660 --> 06:21.825
The attention is enlightened by the power
of the Spirit.

06:22.026 --> 06:29.899
The power of the Spirit is that it is
a reflection.

06:30.100 --> 06:37.076
That means the reflection is never
identified

06:37.277 --> 06:44.867
with the mirror or with the water.

06:45.902 --> 06:51.177
It is there till the sun shines,

06:52.030 --> 06:57.310
and when there is no sun there is
no reflection.

06:57.803 --> 07:10.291
So when you are in Sahaja Yoga you have
cleansed out yourself.

07:10.492 --> 07:14.190
Your Kundalini has also cleansed you,

07:14.390 --> 07:17.690
and now you are pure personalities.

07:17.890 --> 07:25.080
That’s why this reflection is clearer and
clearer,

07:25.281 --> 07:29.049
and people see it; see it on your face;

07:29.250 --> 07:33.379
they see it in your body; they see it
in your work;

07:33.580 --> 07:37.740
in your behaviour; in everywhere.

07:38.890 --> 07:45.960
It is difficult for people to really
believe in themselves,

07:46.160 --> 07:51.110
that they could be the reflection of God
Almighty.

07:51.320 --> 07:57.957
They have some sort of a, complexes about
themselves I think,

07:58.158 --> 08:05.041
that they cannot understand how they have
suddenly become

08:05.242 --> 08:09.029
the reflection of God Almighty,

08:11.960 --> 08:18.313
but they have a capacity; and they can
become

08:18.514 --> 08:22.440
the reflection of God Almighty,

08:22.640 --> 08:26.200
for which they have to have faith
in themselves,

08:26.400 --> 08:32.719
faith in their ascent, to believe that we
have become that.

08:35.407 --> 08:41.867
The confidence in Sahaja Yoga is very
important.

08:42.068 --> 08:47.329
Without the full confidence you cannot
achieve your ascent.

08:47.530 --> 08:49.868
That you have seen even in my lectures,

08:50.069 --> 08:55.300
I have to tell them that we have to have
full self-confidence.

08:55.500 --> 09:02.469
But confidence doesn’t mean by any chance
your ego, your aggressiveness.

09:02.670 --> 09:08.649
If you are confident, you are least
aggressive.

09:09.970 --> 09:13.774
There is a story, a Chinese story, very
interesting one:

09:13.987 --> 09:24.728
that one king wanted his cocks to win in
the race they have about the cock-fighting.

09:25.020 --> 09:30.484
So somebody said that “There is a saint,
if you can take your cocks to him,

09:30.685 --> 09:37.580
he’ll make them so strong that they will
definitely win this race.”

09:37.780 --> 09:41.809
So he took his two cocks and gave it to
the saint and he said,

09:42.010 --> 09:48.958
“I want you to give them all the strength
to fight this race.”

09:49.159 --> 09:55.595
After one month the king came and took
these two cocks,

09:55.796 --> 10:00.886
and put them in the arena where there were
many other cocks also.

10:01.087 --> 10:09.838
So the cocks started fighting and attacking
these two cocks,

10:10.039 --> 10:12.405
but these two cocks were just standing

10:12.606 --> 10:18.440
very patiently, absolutely calm and quiet.

10:18.640 --> 10:25.416
Any kind of attack they were just looking
at it as a fun,

10:25.617 --> 10:29.820
and all the cocks got tired and they ran
away from the arena,

10:30.021 --> 10:34.958
and that’s how these two cocks won
the game.

10:35.159 --> 10:38.760
This is what it is for us to understand,

10:38.960 --> 10:44.382
that for a person who is detached he can
never be attacked.

10:44.583 --> 10:49.335
We are attacked by so many we have.

10:49.536 --> 10:55.199
Firstly our family, then our country,

10:55.400 --> 11:00.000
then our religion, then all kinds of thing,
racialism.

11:00.201 --> 11:03.599
All these identifications really make
us weak,

11:03.800 --> 11:06.225
because they attack us all the time

11:06.426 --> 11:11.380
and put confusion into the minds of Sahaja
Yogis, I have seen.

11:11.580 --> 11:15.000
The reason is, you must have confidence
in Sahaja Yoga

11:15.200 --> 11:19.850
and confidence in yourself, that you are
on the right path

11:20.050 --> 11:25.290
and that you are now saved, and nobody
can attack you

11:25.490 --> 11:29.569
because you have the complete protection
of the Divine.

11:29.770 --> 11:31.933
People may follow any religion,

11:32.134 --> 11:35.230
they may follow any guru, they may follow
anything,

11:35.430 --> 11:40.380
but they have fear all the time that
we’ll be attacked,

11:40.580 --> 11:43.732
and they’re afraid to say things, which
they should say.

11:43.933 --> 11:49.309
They have no discretion even to know what
is to be said.

11:49.510 --> 11:57.710
With the proper understanding that you are
the pure Spirit,

11:57.911 --> 12:02.283
if you believe in that then you’ll be
surprised

12:02.484 --> 12:09.634
that you will be very confident about what
you are doing.

12:09.835 --> 12:17.395
In that way we can say that we have also
another great advantage –

12:17.596 --> 12:21.492
is that we are in the collective.

12:21.693 --> 12:28.060
We can find out in the collective how are
we behaving.

12:28.260 --> 12:31.379
What is the reaction in the collective?

12:31.580 --> 12:37.598
In the collective it’s a person who is very
subtle,

12:37.799 --> 12:41.586
he need not talk too much, he need not
say much.

12:41.787 --> 12:45.190
He could stand like the cocks I told you
about,

12:45.390 --> 12:48.714
but his depth can be felt.

12:48.915 --> 12:52.350
You can feel a person of that caliber,

12:52.551 --> 12:57.499
that he’s such a deep person, that he
doesn’t want to aggress.

12:57.700 --> 13:01.180
He feels protected within himself.

13:01.381 --> 13:03.870
So this protection we have to feel,

13:04.070 --> 13:07.804
not mentally but within ourselves,

13:08.005 --> 13:11.280
and once you have that gravity,

13:11.486 --> 13:16.439
that feeling, nobody can attack you.

13:16.755 --> 13:24.263
The attacking person himself is insecure;
or maybe he is ill-bred;

13:24.464 --> 13:28.720
maybe he is not yet a Sahaja Yogi.

13:28.920 --> 13:36.666
So you have to just have a kind of
a gracious view

13:36.885 --> 13:42.631
about the person. Like Shiva was.

13:42.832 --> 13:45.536
We should say Sadashiva’s character
is known,

13:45.737 --> 13:50.459
that He is the one who used to forgive
anyone.

13:50.660 --> 13:53.790
Anybody who did penance like standing
on their heads

13:53.990 --> 13:59.524
or standing on one foot or not eating their
food or all kinds of penances,

13:59.725 --> 14:06.359
He used to be so disgusted that He would
say: “Alright, what do you want? Take it!”

14:06.677 --> 14:10.651
And He also gave blessings to manyrakshasas

14:10.852 --> 14:14.846
as you have heard and so many rakshasas
were blessed by Him,

14:15.047 --> 14:20.580
because He got fed up with their penances.

14:20.790 --> 14:32.060
There were so many stories about Sadashiva
giving a blessing to people.

14:32.260 --> 14:37.120
Even to Ravana, which is a very interesting
story about Ravana,

14:37.320 --> 14:41.119
that Ravana did lots of penance. I don’t
know what he did,

14:41.320 --> 14:47.721
how much he must have starved with his
ten heads and what …

14:47.922 --> 14:53.490
I mean, if one mouth is there you feel so
hungry – with ten mouths!

14:53.690 --> 14:57.968
I don’t know what he must have done

14:58.169 --> 15:01.709
to do that kind of a penance that Shiva
just got fed up, you see.

15:01.910 --> 15:03.969
His compassion is so great He thought:

15:04.170 --> 15:06.725
“Let this man have whatever he likes.”

15:06.926 --> 15:11.510
So Ravana went to Shiva and Shiva said:
“What do you want?

15:11.710 --> 15:17.447
Why are you doing all this to yourself?”
So he said that

15:17.648 --> 15:20.836
“I want to have a blessing”. He said:
“What blessing?”

15:21.037 --> 15:24.710
“First you promise that whatever I ask for,
you will give me.”

15:24.911 --> 15:27.880
He said: “Of course. If it is in my power,
I’ll give”.

15:28.080 --> 15:30.280
It’s a very interesting story.

15:30.480 --> 15:36.270
So he said: “I want to have your wife”.

15:36.470 --> 15:39.420
Because he knew His wife is Adi Shakti,

15:39.620 --> 15:44.759
and if he gets the Adi Shakti as a partner
with him,

15:44.960 --> 15:47.285
he can do wonders.

15:47.486 --> 15:56.294
So he asked that: “I should get your wife
as my partner.”

15:58.056 --> 16:02.479
Now, it was very difficult, you see, for
Him to take such a decision

16:02.704 --> 16:09.010
to give in to this devil, but in compassion
He did it.

16:09.211 --> 16:12.452
And all these events you see really show

16:12.653 --> 16:18.952
that how His compassion works out things.

16:19.230 --> 16:28.024
As a result it was decided that

16:28.225 --> 16:35.190
His wife Parvati had to go with this
horrible fellow.

16:35.390 --> 16:43.875
But Parvati’s sister (brother) was Shri
Vishnu, that is Shri Krishna,

16:44.076 --> 16:50.158
and He said to Himself that: “I can’t allow

16:50.359 --> 16:53.830
my sister to go with this devil. I must do
something about it.”

16:54.030 --> 16:59.938
The most mischievous one is Shri Krishna.
So what He did was

17:00.139 --> 17:06.220
to make him feel like going for the
bathroom.

17:06.420 --> 17:09.076
So he felt shy, he put the lady on one side

17:09.277 --> 17:16.755
and he went to the bathroom. Now Shiva
had warned him that:

17:16.956 --> 17:20.040
“You’d better be careful, because this
Mother Earth

17:20.241 --> 17:25.117
is the mother of this lady, and never put
Her on the Mother Earth.

17:25.318 --> 17:29.790
You must carry Him (Her) all the time
on your back.”

17:29.991 --> 17:34.480
So when he reached a certain point

17:34.680 --> 17:39.433
this Shri Krishna created a mischief,

17:39.634 --> 17:41.969
and he felt like going.

17:42.170 --> 17:44.186
So he put Her down. As soon as he put
Her down,

17:44.387 --> 17:50.030
the Mother Earth sucked Her in and he
didn’t know what to do.

17:50.230 --> 17:53.108
Second time again he tried.

17:53.309 --> 17:57.334
And he again went to Shiva and he said:

17:57.535 --> 18:02.130
“See now, this is what you have promised,
and this is what he is doing.”

18:02.330 --> 18:07.159
So He said: “I had warned you that Her
brother is a very mischievous fellow

18:07.360 --> 18:11.410
and He’ll somehow or other manage,
so you’d better be careful.

18:11.611 --> 18:15.164
This time you don’t listen to him.

18:15.365 --> 18:19.094
Don’t put Her on the ground, whatever
it may be.”

18:19.295 --> 18:26.963
So this time he did another try,

18:27.164 --> 18:31.278
we can say, and carried Her on his back.

18:31.479 --> 18:33.745
Suddenly he found a little boy.

18:33.946 --> 18:39.010
It was Shri Krishna himself laughing
at him.

18:39.210 --> 18:41.600
He said: “Why are you laughing at me?”

18:41.810 --> 18:47.020
“Oh my, why are you carrying this old woman
on your back?

18:47.220 --> 18:49.900
She has no ornaments.” He said: “She’s
the Goddess.”

18:50.100 --> 18:53.360
He said: “No. She has no ornaments.
She’s wearing nothing.

18:53.560 --> 18:55.170
How can She be the Goddess?”

18:55.370 --> 19:00.420
So you see in India that’s a … proverb
we use.

19:00.620 --> 19:05.189
Somebody, some lady who has, who lives
without any ornaments or anything,

19:05.390 --> 19:08.240
that she’s like the Lanka Parvati.

19:08.440 --> 19:14.030
So he was carrying Her to Lanka. And
when he looked at Her up,

19:14.230 --> 19:19.753
he saw a very old woman without any teeth
you know, laughing at him.

19:19.954 --> 19:26.436
He got such a fright he threw Her away.
That’s Mahamaya!

19:27.448 --> 19:31.620
Then the third situation was, he went
and told that:

19:31.822 --> 19:35.551
“You’d better tell your wife that She’s not
to listen to anybody,

19:35.760 --> 19:38.800
and you’d better see that you give me
your wife itself.”

19:39.000 --> 19:42.540
He said: “Alright, She’ll be born in Lanka
and you can marry Her.”

19:42.741 --> 19:48.540
Her name was Mandodari. Now the great
story goes on like that.

19:48.741 --> 19:53.654
But this Mandodari was the great worshipper
of Vishnu,

19:53.855 --> 19:59.500
and at the time when Rama came, you see,
to kill him.

19:59.700 --> 20:04.260
All this was organised by Mandodari
Herself.

20:04.461 --> 20:10.384
She knows, knew that if Shri Rama
kills Ravana

20:10.585 --> 20:15.702
he will get his liberation from these ideas
about women;

20:15.903 --> 20:21.139
the way he was running after Sita and doing
all these things.

20:21.340 --> 20:27.013
She actually wanted that something should
happen that he should take another birth,

20:27.214 --> 20:35.269
and he should get rid of these notions
of looking after beautiful women,

20:35.470 --> 20:39.029
and the way he brought Sitaji there.

20:39.230 --> 20:42.164
She was against it completely, but he
would not listen.

20:42.365 --> 20:49.363
So the war took place, and in the war he
was killed by Shri Rama.

20:49.564 --> 21:03.628
All this episode came because of the
unlimited compassion of Shri Shiva.

21:04.025 --> 21:11.285
His compassion is to look at, looks very
illogical sometimes,

21:11.486 --> 21:14.024
but there’s a big logic behind it.

21:14.225 --> 21:18.265
The logic is that whatever He does

21:18.466 --> 21:28.461
brings forth a kind of a solution of the
problem.

21:28.945 --> 21:34.945
For example, there was a war on, and
the war was going on,

21:35.154 --> 21:43.899
and that time there was a problem because
there was one horrible devil

21:44.100 --> 21:49.539
who was given blessings by Shri Shiva

21:49.740 --> 21:53.273
that: “Nobody can kill you.”

21:53.474 --> 22:01.172
He had given also blessings - as they call
varadan - to another saint,

22:01.373 --> 22:06.415
who said: “I want to sleep now and nobody
should disturb me.”

22:06.616 --> 22:08.880
So he was given a blessing:

22:09.081 --> 22:11.871
“Anybody who disturbs you in your sleep,

22:12.072 --> 22:18.411
you can just look at that person and that
will be, he’ll be reduced to ashes.”

22:18.612 --> 22:24.456
So these two now, when the war started,
you see, Shri Krishna thought,

22:24.657 --> 22:33.320
“Best thing is to kill this devil with
the same blessings

22:33.520 --> 22:37.932
that the saint has got.” So He played

22:38.133 --> 22:43.437
and He started running away from
the battlefield;

22:43.638 --> 22:49.325
and that’s why He’s called

22:51.338 --> 22:55.914
as a warrior who has ran out of the field.

22:56.115 --> 23:02.740
Ranchordas – the one who runs away
out of the field of battle.

23:03.631 --> 23:09.027
And when He was running He was wearing
a shawl, Shri Krishna.

23:09.228 --> 23:12.199
He just stealthily entered into the cave

23:12.415 --> 23:18.987
and there’s another saint was sleeping and
put His shawl on top of that.

23:19.257 --> 23:23.439
So when He put the shawl on top of him,

23:24.662 --> 23:31.582
the gentleman, I mean, the devil who was
following Him, the satanic fellow,

23:31.783 --> 23:38.152
he reached that place and saw the same
shawl

23:38.353 --> 23:41.470
and he said: “Oh, so now you are tired

23:41.670 --> 23:44.943
and now you are sleeping here. I’ll put
you right!”

23:45.144 --> 23:51.302
Without realising who was sleeping and he
pulled the shawl.

23:51.503 --> 23:57.026
And here the sleeping saint gets up and
looks at him,

23:57.227 --> 24:00.828
and they say with his third eye he burnt.

24:01.029 --> 24:05.037
So the solution came in. So the whole
play is like this,

24:05.238 --> 24:11.871
of three forces going on, just to show
ultimately the truth prevails.

24:12.087 --> 24:19.070
First is the, Shiva’s compassion, His
goodness, to one side.

24:19.271 --> 24:27.620
Then the play of Shri Krishna or say
Shri Vishnu of neutralizing it;

24:29.028 --> 24:41.062
and the third is the play of Brahma who
creates things and who produces things.

24:41.263 --> 24:44.803
All these three forces are playing,

24:45.004 --> 24:50.543
just to create an atmosphere for all of us
to feel

24:50.744 --> 24:55.846
that there is something else is to be done
to our human awareness.

24:56.047 --> 25:04.590
All they have evolved within us this desire
to seek the truth.

25:04.985 --> 25:09.608
Now on one side Shiva is extremely
compassionate,

25:09.809 --> 25:14.422
very kind even to asuras, the rakshasas.

25:14.623 --> 25:20.716
But on the other side He can be extremely
cruel.

25:20.917 --> 25:24.747
He can destroy the whole universe.

25:24.948 --> 25:28.667
If the people are so decadent,

25:28.868 --> 25:35.804
if the people do not take to spirituality,

25:36.948 --> 25:41.029
if their innocence is completely lost,

25:41.230 --> 25:46.886
if they do not get detached from all these
wrong identifications

25:47.087 --> 25:50.267
which are creating problems in this world,

25:50.468 --> 25:53.646
He destroys the whole universe.

25:53.847 --> 25:59.326
So as it is He is the spectator of the work
of Adi Shakti.

25:59.527 --> 26:02.770
He allows Her to do all this work,

26:02.984 --> 26:07.511
to create human beings, to give them
Realization, do all this.

26:07.712 --> 26:12.005
But in case He finds Her children,

26:12.206 --> 26:18.408
people who have been saved by Her,
are misbehaving

26:18.609 --> 26:22.741
or insulting or in any way destroying
Her work,

26:22.942 --> 26:29.822
He might get into a temper by which He can
destroy the whole universe.

26:30.385 --> 26:34.314
But I don’t think now there’s any chance
for Him to do that,

26:34.515 --> 26:38.384
because we have now Sahaja Yogis all over.

26:38.585 --> 26:42.960
But what I find amongst Sahaja Yogis
is this

26:43.161 --> 26:47.519
that some of the Sahaja Yogis grow
very fast.

26:47.720 --> 26:55.179
Steadily, strongly, they achieve their
principle of Shiva Tattwa.

26:55.380 --> 27:03.130
The first achievement shows that from
inside they start getting detached.

27:03.570 --> 27:07.137
Now detachment is not mental. It’s not
mental.

27:07.338 --> 27:12.990
It is not that we have to take to some sort
of a sanyasa

27:13.190 --> 27:17.616
or we have to go to Himalayas, give up
our families and all that.

27:17.817 --> 27:25.950
But the detachment is within oneself. When
that detachment starts working,

27:26.151 --> 27:33.823
the first sign is that we become joyous,
we become happy.

27:34.024 --> 27:38.821
Now if you ask anyone: “Why are you
unhappy?”,

27:39.022 --> 27:45.711
he’ll talk about his wife, maybe his house,
maybe his children,

27:45.912 --> 27:53.376
maybe his country, maybe society, whatever
it is.

27:53.577 --> 28:00.357
So he gets absolutely upset, or maybe
very unhappy

28:00.558 --> 28:04.856
to see things happening around him.

28:05.057 --> 28:13.140
Now he is a realized soul this unhappiness
is not going to help him.

28:13.432 --> 28:19.443
What is needed is now to know that you
can correct

28:19.644 --> 28:27.552
all these ills of the society, of the
family, of the whole country,

28:27.753 --> 28:32.550
by transforming others, not by feeling bad.

28:32.751 --> 28:39.711
But while doing that, the main thing that
you should have is a complete detachment.

28:39.912 --> 28:43.960
I was amazed when I first started Sahaja
Yoga

28:44.161 --> 28:49.547
how people told me about their own
countrymen, country fellows,

28:49.748 --> 28:54.295
I was amazed how they told me about their
own religions,

28:54.496 --> 28:57.715
how wrong things they are doing.

28:57.916 --> 29:00.685
I didn’t know so much as they told me,

29:00.886 --> 29:04.483
and I thought that this is a detachment
that has come

29:04.684 --> 29:08.538
that they can see clearly what’s wrong;

29:08.739 --> 29:16.750
what’s wrong with my society, with
my people,

29:16.951 --> 29:22.963
with my relations, with my family, with my
country, with the whole world.

29:23.164 --> 29:30.635
But is only possible if you are not
identified through any one of them,

29:30.836 --> 29:33.586
otherwise you will never see the defects.

29:33.787 --> 29:35.842
You’ll never see what’s wrong with
that person.

29:36.043 --> 29:39.711
You can never even see the chakras, which
are catching.

29:39.912 --> 29:45.255
So the first thing that should happen
is detachment.

29:45.456 --> 29:49.693
Now how to achieve detachment is the point.

29:49.894 --> 29:53.357
Many people ask me, “Mother, how do you
get detached?”

29:53.558 --> 29:56.825
Because I am not attached you see, so I’m
already detached.

29:57.026 --> 29:59.548
I don’t know how to do that way.

29:59.749 --> 30:05.766
But for you people I would say,
to understand yourself

30:05.967 --> 30:08.389
you should introspect.

30:08.590 --> 30:14.307
Try to find out to what thing am I
attached. Why am I miserable?

30:14.508 --> 30:18.367
For whom am I worried? Why should I worry?

30:18.568 --> 30:22.841
Some things you see which were never
very important,

30:23.042 --> 30:25.668
they become very important to certain
Sahaja Yogis.

30:25.869 --> 30:31.510
For example I was told that in the West,
people don’t care

30:34.036 --> 30:39.389
so much for their children. But as soon
as they get Realization

30:39.590 --> 30:46.509
they just get attached to their children,
like as if with some glue.

30:46.710 --> 30:49.630
They cannot think what is good for
their children.

30:49.830 --> 30:57.065
Everything about children they think is
their primary duty.

30:57.265 --> 31:03.032
The other day I was surprised when they
told me that it’s the parents

31:03.233 --> 31:10.200
who want to come after the Birthday Puja.
I was shocked.

31:10.400 --> 31:13.171
I mean, just on the way is Birthday Puja.

31:13.372 --> 31:19.180
Why should the parents want to come
after that?

31:19.697 --> 31:22.329
When I told Yogi he said: “Mother,

31:22.530 --> 31:25.629
we’ll be very happy if they are here, and
they should be.

31:25.830 --> 31:28.592
Because it will help the children, it will
help the parents.”

31:28.793 --> 31:32.264
But the whole now attention goes
to the children,

31:32.465 --> 31:36.790
that “We must leave the children there
and we must look after them”,

31:36.991 --> 31:40.351
and that’s the only thing.

31:42.787 --> 31:48.600
So the attachment to children will
definitely make you do such things,

31:48.800 --> 31:53.430
which are not good, not good for you.

31:53.692 --> 31:58.784
So this new attachment starts after Sahaja
Yoga, I’ve seen, very common.

31:58.985 --> 32:02.486
Then another attachment is, say, to your
family.

32:02.687 --> 32:06.855
Normally there are no such things
in the West.

32:07.056 --> 32:09.309
People are not attached to their family
much, you see.

32:09.510 --> 32:12.798
They drink, they do all kinds of things.

32:12.999 --> 32:17.640
Suddenly they become self-realized

32:17.840 --> 32:23.845
and it’s like a boomerang, they come back
to the family

32:24.046 --> 32:28.440
It is so attached to the family, attached
to the house,

32:28.640 --> 32:32.763
attached to everything. I just can’t
understand.

32:32.964 --> 32:37.510
If you are becoming the pure Spirit then
you are detached,

32:37.710 --> 32:43.459
because you are just a reflection, but
the reflection of God Almighty.

32:43.660 --> 32:47.795
So all these identifications drop out.

32:47.996 --> 32:50.499
Now one may say, “How? How to drop it out?”

32:50.700 --> 32:52.169
I’ve never dropped them,

32:52.370 --> 32:55.590
but still I can suggest certain things,
which you can try.

32:55.790 --> 32:59.390
First is meditation.

32:59.698 --> 33:03.186
You should discover about yourself, what’s
wrong with you,

33:03.387 --> 33:07.719
which side is catching, is it right or left
side.

33:07.920 --> 33:10.180
With meditation you can find out.

33:10.381 --> 33:14.099
Are you attached to money, are you
attached to business,

33:14.300 --> 33:19.476
are you attached to your family, are you
attached to your country

33:19.677 --> 33:25.510
in a way which is not Sahaj

33:25.711 --> 33:28.815
or to your culture, which is not Sahaj?

33:29.016 --> 33:36.006
Then try to get rid of this attachment
by meditation.

33:36.207 --> 33:40.343
You know how to get rid of the right
and the left.

33:40.544 --> 33:44.473
This attachment will show on your
fingertips,

33:44.674 --> 33:49.432
and you have to see for yourself what
centres you are catching,

33:49.633 --> 33:55.969
in which way are you in trouble. And then
you can clarify it

33:56.170 --> 34:01.820
very simply by taking a very simple Sahaj
treatment.

34:02.020 --> 34:08.191
I think here we fail, that once we get
attached to something,

34:08.392 --> 34:10.605
we don’t even think we are getting
attached.

34:10.806 --> 34:12.489
We think we are doing very great thing

34:12.690 --> 34:16.270
because now we love this person, love
that person,

34:16.470 --> 34:20.600
Shiva’s qualities, the compassion part.

34:20.801 --> 34:24.731
You start getting attached to people.

34:24.932 --> 34:29.277
That is no compassion. That is no
compassion of any kind.

34:29.478 --> 34:33.137
To be attached to any such things is
no compassion,

34:33.342 --> 34:37.381
and you cannot have compassion of Shiva,

34:37.582 --> 34:40.908
though people think it is the Shiva’s
compassion that is working within us.

34:41.109 --> 34:52.278
It’s not, because that compassion is very
pure.

34:52.497 --> 34:56.772
It is like as I’ve told you many a times,
it’s like the sap in the tree

34:56.973 --> 35:02.603
which rises and goes to various parts
of the tree,

35:02.804 --> 35:09.362
and then either it evaporates or goes down
into Mother Earth. It’s not attached.

35:09.563 --> 35:16.807
If it gets attached to one flower or to one
leaf or to one fruit,

35:17.008 --> 35:24.081
then the whole tree will suffer and also
the flower will disappear.

35:24.282 --> 35:33.087
So this kind of attachment to a particular
thing, to a particular idea is not proper.

35:33.288 --> 35:41.342
In Sahaja Yoga I’ve found people are very
adaptable and understand

35:41.543 --> 35:46.395
what they should do, but the main thing
is meditation.

35:46.596 --> 35:49.960
In meditating on your heart, on the Shiva
Tattwa,

35:50.169 --> 35:54.490
on the principle of Shiva, you can
definitely detach,

35:54.691 --> 36:01.602
and then the joy will be the maximum,
joy will be the maximum.

36:01.803 --> 36:05.153
I’ve seen people have interest in, say,
food

36:05.354 --> 36:12.343
or in clothes or in house, anything.

36:12.544 --> 36:18.467
You can have interest, you should have
interest, but in that interest

36:18.668 --> 36:24.610
there should be enlightenment, that you
cannot get attached to it.

36:25.015 --> 36:32.062
Some people, say, who are say, from South
India, they don’t like North Indian food.

36:32.263 --> 36:35.789
Those who are from North India don’t like
South Indian.

36:35.990 --> 36:40.039
It’s a big problem. I asked the people
in Indian Airlines:

36:40.240 --> 36:42.359
“Why don’t you have some standard food?”

36:42.560 --> 36:45.314
He said: “What is the standard food
of India? Tell me.”

36:45.515 --> 36:47.384
But it was a question.

36:47.585 --> 36:50.995
Indians are very particular about
the taste and food.

36:51.196 --> 36:56.335
So it’s a fact we don’t have any standard
food in India.

36:56.536 --> 36:59.715
But in the same way, we can say in so many
other ways

36:59.916 --> 37:09.284
that in the West people run after things,
which are not necessary.

37:09.485 --> 37:14.226
They do things just out of fashion, or
I don’t know,

37:14.427 --> 37:17.474
because their personality is not grown-up.

37:17.675 --> 37:24.523
If your personality is grown up then you
see everything, everything

37:24.724 --> 37:28.360
from an angle, which is much higher
than others,

37:28.561 --> 37:31.108
and you don’t get dissolved with others.

37:31.309 --> 37:37.193
What you know is much higher, much greater
and much more joy giving.

37:37.394 --> 37:41.974
Now these attachments, people think that
it’s very joy giving.

37:42.175 --> 37:49.213
If you get a child and if you have say,
a wife and everything, are joy giving.

37:49.414 --> 37:51.143
It’s a very wrong idea.

37:51.344 --> 37:55.870
The joy comes from your own source
of your Spirit.

37:56.071 --> 38:00.940
Whether your husband is good, whether
your children are good or bad,

38:01.141 --> 38:05.222
whatever they are, they cannot give you
joy.

38:05.423 --> 38:08.853
It’s only you can enjoy yourself,

38:09.054 --> 38:15.406
and this is why one becomes very forgiving.

38:15.607 --> 38:21.287
When nobody can harm you, then whom are
you going to be angry with?

38:21.488 --> 38:24.430
That is another great quality of Sadashiva,

38:24.630 --> 38:26.824
is that He is extremely forgiving.

38:27.025 --> 38:32.958
He goes up to a point, till He destroys
the whole work of Adi Shakti.

38:33.159 --> 38:36.533
But otherwise He is very, very forgiving,

38:36.734 --> 38:40.720
and He also is very balanced about it.

38:40.921 --> 38:44.732
Once the Adi Shakti got very angry with
the whole world,

38:44.933 --> 38:49.348
was so decadent and all that and She
started destroying everything.

38:49.549 --> 38:52.590
So He put a little child under Her feet,

38:52.791 --> 38:56.093
and such a big tongue came out with
such a shock,

38:56.294 --> 38:59.780
She stopped Her destruction.

38:59.981 --> 39:04.164
So His ways are such that a person

39:04.365 --> 39:10.587
who is to develop the Shiva principle
within himself

39:10.788 --> 39:14.254
should be extremely forgiving.

39:14.455 --> 39:18.957
I know there are people who are very cruel
and who are very tortur.

39:19.158 --> 39:23.908
If you cannot bear it, alright, finish
it off.

39:24.109 --> 39:27.823
I’ll stand by you there; but if you can
bear it

39:28.024 --> 39:34.371
is better to bear, and undergo this
experience of bearing it,

39:34.572 --> 39:39.981
because it’s not difficult to bear than
to get out of it.

39:40.182 --> 39:42.625
For example, a lady came to me, and
she said:

39:42.826 --> 39:45.724
“I’m going to divorce my husband.”
I said: “Why?”

39:45.925 --> 39:49.783
“Because he comes home very late and
I get very little of him.”

39:49.984 --> 39:56.358
But I said, “When you divorce you’ll not
get him at all! What’s the logic?

39:56.559 --> 40:00.581
At least now you see him, whatever it is,
whenever, whatever the time is there.

40:00.782 --> 40:06.199
But this is no solution. If you divorce him
you’ll never see him.

40:06.400 --> 40:09.233
So what’s the use of such a divorce?”

40:09.434 --> 40:15.573
So many things like that can be understood
once you are a detached person,

40:15.774 --> 40:18.744
that you are not to be attached
to anything.

40:18.945 --> 40:24.442
Now who can aggress you if you are not
attached to anyone?

40:24.643 --> 40:28.685
Nobody can. Only thing when you feel

40:28.886 --> 40:32.645
that you have to protest, you should,
but with detachment.

40:32.846 --> 40:40.418
In protest also is important to absolutely
to have a complete detachment.

40:40.619 --> 40:47.768
Now the main problem before us today
is something else:

40:47.969 --> 40:53.719
is that we all have to ascend,

40:54.393 --> 41:02.379
and ascend with equal strength.

41:03.101 --> 41:11.990
There’s a story about some birds who were
caught in a net,

41:12.191 --> 41:17.394
so they decided that we should get out
of this net, and they tried.

41:17.595 --> 41:23.023
Everybody tried to get out, but nobody
individually could work it out.

41:23.224 --> 41:27.975
So they all decided to fly together, “One,
two, three, go!”,

41:28.176 --> 41:31.964
and they took all that net with them.

41:32.165 --> 41:42.749
And they said, then they requested the rats
that “Please come and cut our net.”

41:42.950 --> 41:45.073
And they were freed.

41:45.274 --> 41:49.229
So if it can happen between the rats
and the birds,

41:49.430 --> 41:51.732
why not between us?

41:51.933 --> 41:56.886
So in collectivity, you’ll be amazed,

41:57.087 --> 42:02.249
in the collectivity how we could be helpful
and joyous with each other.

42:02.450 --> 42:05.103
Now say something is wrong

42:05.304 --> 42:09.664
with your mother, father, sisters,
somebody, doesn’t matter.

42:09.865 --> 42:14.590
After all you have the ocean of joy here
with the collectivity,

42:14.791 --> 42:16.766
and your problems can be solved

42:16.967 --> 42:21.190
if collectively, if you want to solve
your problem.

42:21.391 --> 42:24.647
So we have to depend on the collectivity,

42:24.848 --> 42:28.254
very much to be one with the collective.

42:28.455 --> 42:33.728
I feel once you jump into the sea of Sahaj,

42:33.929 --> 42:36.755
the joy itself draws you together.

42:36.956 --> 42:40.426
Meeting each other is such a joyous thing!

42:40.627 --> 42:43.237
We have had so many experiences of that,

42:43.438 --> 42:48.275
of Sahaja Yogis who have told me how
happy they were to find

42:48.476 --> 42:54.740
Sahaja Yogis somewhere out of the blue,
and how they felt happy.

42:54.941 --> 43:04.833
So this tie between the Sahaja Yogis is
really the most joyous channel,

43:05.034 --> 43:12.149
and that is what is the source we should
say, of our becoming one together.

43:12.350 --> 43:16.355
Once you start enjoying each other…

43:17.394 --> 43:21.367
I’ve told you once a story of a great
poet in India

43:21.568 --> 43:26.258
whose name was Namdeva, who was a tailor.

43:26.459 --> 43:34.165
And there was another one who was
a… potter.

43:34.366 --> 43:37.294
Sometimes I miss out in English words.

43:37.495 --> 43:47.387
This potter was another poet and he was
called as Gorakumbhar.

43:47.657 --> 43:50.706
So when Namdeva went to meet him –

43:50.907 --> 43:54.138
a saint only feels like meeting a saint –

43:54.339 --> 44:02.521
looked at him, and he just stood back and
then he said a beautiful couplet.

44:02.722 --> 44:09.297
He says that: “I came here to see the form,
formless Chaitanya,

44:09.498 --> 44:14.494
but here the Chaitanya is in the form” -

44:14.725 --> 44:17.568
‘Nirgunachah beti allo sagunashi’ -

44:17.768 --> 44:22.649
“I came to see the formless, to see
the vibrations,

44:22.850 --> 44:27.427
but here the, it is in the form that
I see it.”

44:27.628 --> 44:31.862
Only a saint can say this to another saint.

44:32.063 --> 44:35.909
This kind of appreciation, this subtle
appreciation

44:36.110 --> 44:42.323
is only possible between the two saints,
or between the many.

44:42.524 --> 44:46.202
They don’t see he was kneading the clay;

44:46.403 --> 44:52.225
he was wearing a dirty dhoti, doing
that work.

44:52.426 --> 44:54.416
He never saw all these things.

44:54.617 --> 44:57.682
He never saw his body, face or anything,

44:57.883 --> 45:05.336
but he saw that the Divinity personified
in him.

45:06.796 --> 45:11.849
This sensitivity of feeling for other
Sahaja Yogis

45:12.050 --> 45:16.686
should really develop within you.

45:16.887 --> 45:22.287
Then you won’t care for nonsensical,
superficial things,

45:22.488 --> 45:28.184
and this is one of the great principles
of Shiva.

45:28.385 --> 45:33.855
He doesn’t bother. Now see, His hair
are all matted up,

45:34.056 --> 45:40.093
He sits on a fast-moving bull with both
the legs like that

45:40.294 --> 45:44.487
going for His wedding. Can you imagine?

45:45.083 --> 45:48.302
And all His friends, all His followers

45:48.511 --> 45:53.535
are somebody has only one eye, another
has only one hand,

45:53.736 --> 45:56.474
one is bent like that,

45:56.675 --> 46:04.738
because for Him the outside personality
doesn’t matter.

46:04.939 --> 46:10.524
What matters is the spirituality. Whether
you have one eye

46:10.833 --> 46:14.789
or whether you have a crooked body makes
no difference to Him.

46:14.990 --> 46:20.237
To Him all of them are His own people,

46:20.438 --> 46:26.038
because nothing that is superficial
attracts His attention,

46:26.244 --> 46:30.127
but the divinity in a person.

46:30.328 --> 46:35.382
We have so many ways of understanding
His principle,

46:35.583 --> 46:39.138
because He is all-pervading.

46:39.339 --> 46:46.735
If you feel compassion for someone
it works. It definitely works.

46:46.936 --> 46:57.841
Recently there was a case of some sort
of a, incurable disease in Mexico.

46:58.042 --> 46:59.855
And the lady, who was Mexican,

47:00.055 --> 47:03.235
who was working in the UN, she’s still
working in UN,

47:03.436 --> 47:09.401
she wrote to me two letters, that “Mother,
I’m going to lose my son

47:09.602 --> 47:15.908
because he has this horrible disease.”
I mean, just she wrote to me.

47:16.109 --> 47:20.365
I just felt such compassion for her,

47:20.566 --> 47:25.348
because she wrote a letter, which brought
tears to my eyes.

47:25.549 --> 47:31.013
And imagine, those tears have cured
that boy!

47:34.511 --> 47:39.513
(Shri Mataji speaks aside: “It has fallen.”
Then Hindi)

47:44.059 --> 47:47.131
Has cured that boy completely,

47:47.332 --> 47:54.624
and she wrote me a letter of, thanking
and all.

47:54.825 --> 47:59.940
I was amazed, because my compassion
is not mental.

48:00.141 --> 48:06.001
It just works, it’s just there, just flows
and works it out.

48:06.202 --> 48:10.037
In the same way you can also become that.

48:10.238 --> 48:13.120
I want you to have all my powers.

48:13.321 --> 48:16.472
But first is the compassion.

48:16.673 --> 48:19.991
And a Sahaja Yogi cannot ill-treat another
person, anyone.

48:20.192 --> 48:23.789
Whether he’s a Sahaja Yogi or not a Sahaja
Yogi, that’s not important.

48:23.997 --> 48:29.622
But nobody can aggress other Sahaja Yogis.

48:29.823 --> 48:39.203
If you say even he’s a non Sahaja Yogi,
Sahaja Yogis should never aggress.

48:39.404 --> 48:45.941
That’s not a sign of a Sahaja Yogi. Sahaja
Yogi is different.

48:46.142 --> 48:48.960
Like the other day somebody said, I said:
“You are very hot-tempered.”

48:49.161 --> 48:53.210
“Yes, yes, I am, when somebody provokes
me.”

48:53.411 --> 48:56.492
I said: “Everybody when he’s provoked
only gets angry.

48:56.693 --> 49:03.658
Only the mad are such who do not get angry
when they are provoked, you see.

49:03.859 --> 49:07.884
So if you get angry when you are provoked,
is nothing so great.

49:08.085 --> 49:11.166
Everybody gets angry like that, when you
are provoked.

49:11.367 --> 49:14.717
But if you say that if you are not provoked
then you will not get angry,

49:14.918 --> 49:17.514
that sort of a state is very different.”

49:17.715 --> 49:26.806
So what I find, that in the whole
atmosphere of today

49:27.007 --> 49:36.350
in the modern times, there’s a big struggle
going on,

49:36.731 --> 49:41.007
which is not Shiva’s culture.

49:41.236 --> 49:49.537
Shiva’s culture is the, I should say,
the Sahaj culture.

49:49.842 --> 49:57.567
If you are Sahaja Yogis you should have
compassion in you,

49:57.909 --> 50:02.879
understanding of others’ feelings;

50:03.080 --> 50:08.736
and also should have readiness to look
after

50:08.937 --> 50:12.859
not only Sahaja Yogis, also non Sahaja
Yogis,

50:13.060 --> 50:17.109
then your compassion will become effective.

50:17.310 --> 50:25.519
Now as you know today, the biggest problem
of today’s civilisation

50:25.720 --> 50:29.638
is the Western culture has gone to dogs.

50:29.839 --> 50:32.104
They are going, I mean when you read
the newspaper

50:32.304 --> 50:35.128
you are shocked the way things are
happening.

50:35.329 --> 50:40.403
I don’t know how many will realise it
before their destruction.

50:40.604 --> 50:42.922
It’s really self-destructing.

50:43.123 --> 50:51.221
On one side this is the self-indulgent and
permissive society, which is working.

50:51.422 --> 50:59.867
Now on the other side I find the Islamic
culture is trying to oppose it.

51:00.068 --> 51:03.834
That’s correct, their trying to oppose it
is correct,

51:04.035 --> 51:07.822
but the way they are opposing is creating
problems.

51:08.023 --> 51:11.658
If you oppress somebody – “Don’t do this,
don’t do that” –

51:11.859 --> 51:15.503
then they’ll do it much more. I’ll give
an example,

51:15.704 --> 51:23.036
that if you go into the north of India
the culture is more Islamic,

51:23.237 --> 51:28.853
and the people are very licentious and
all the time looking at women.

51:29.054 --> 51:34.093
Not all, but many; though they are say,
they are Hindus or they say this and that,

51:34.294 --> 51:37.566
but still they have all these bad habits,

51:37.767 --> 51:41.127
which have come from Islamic suppression.

51:41.328 --> 51:45.012
When a woman is completely covered

51:45.213 --> 51:49.031
and nobody can see her, they become much
more curious.

51:49.232 --> 51:54.046
I have some people who came to Bombay
and somebody was travelling with me,

51:54.247 --> 51:56.509
and he was looking at every woman
on the street.

51:56.710 --> 52:00.999
I tell, I said: “Your neck will break now,
the way you are going on.”

52:01.214 --> 52:03.158
But is a common practice there.

52:03.359 --> 52:06.456
Not only that, but this curiosity goes
too far

52:06.657 --> 52:09.527
and people can become extremely immoral,

52:09.728 --> 52:12.460
just like we are in the West.

52:12.661 --> 52:21.256
So the suppression of your desires is
also wrong.

52:21.457 --> 52:27.190
Also this culture, which outwardly
suppresses,

52:27.391 --> 52:31.671
but inwardly people are very immoral.

52:31.872 --> 52:37.114
Once I was travelling from Riyadh to London
and I went off to sleep.

52:37.315 --> 52:41.574
When I got up, I saw some other people
sitting there all very nicely dressed up

52:41.775 --> 52:47.239
with short skirts and women with –
all the bow ties and this and that -

52:47.450 --> 52:49.906
so I asked the air hostess, I said: “Did we
stop somewhere?”

52:50.107 --> 52:51.923
She said: “No, no, we have been going
directly.”

52:52.132 --> 52:55.682
I said: “Then who are these people?”
“Same.”

52:55.883 --> 52:58.621
“They are so much changed!” I mean,
I was surprised

52:58.822 --> 53:02.331
that they were wearing such long, these
chador and all that,

53:02.532 --> 53:06.692
and now here they are with all these
funny dresses.

53:06.893 --> 53:10.633
I couldn’t understand. So that’s what
happens.

53:10.834 --> 53:17.134
The curiosity created by suppression also
is not helpful.

53:17.335 --> 53:19.277
In Sahaja Yoga there’s no question
of suppression.

53:19.478 --> 53:23.401
You become innocent, just become innocent.

53:23.602 --> 53:26.277
That is the principle of Shiva.

53:26.478 --> 53:31.758
This Sahaj culture is in the centre. It has
neither too much of licentiousness

53:31.959 --> 53:35.809
nor too much of suppression, but it is
in the centre,

53:36.010 --> 53:42.006
which is the, Shiva’s greatest principle is
to be innocent.

53:42.207 --> 53:46.325
And this innocence just shines in you,
I have seen it.

53:46.526 --> 53:49.380
You people, whatever you might have
done before,

53:49.581 --> 53:54.481
but I see you are so pure. You don’t have
these stupid ideas

53:54.682 --> 54:01.379
of behaving in a manner that is so Western.

54:01.580 --> 54:05.756
Also, so many Islamic people I’ve seen who
have come to Sahaja Yoga,

54:05.957 --> 54:09.967
have become very, very Sahaj

54:10.168 --> 54:14.217
and are leading a very good life.

54:14.418 --> 54:19.764
We have some Iranians who sent me
letters of their confessions,

54:19.965 --> 54:23.567
and I was shocked. I never read them
because it was too much for me.

54:23.768 --> 54:28.795
And now I find them to be the most moral
people that we have.

54:28.996 --> 54:34.056
So going to one extreme is wrong, or
to another is wrong.

54:34.257 --> 54:39.428
But to be in the centre, in the Sahaj is
the best way to understand

54:39.629 --> 54:44.406
what is so important for life is morality.

54:44.607 --> 54:47.720
And that comes from your innocence.

54:47.921 --> 54:55.436
And that is the quality of, of course,
Shri Ganesha, who is the Son of Shiva,

54:55.637 --> 55:04.359
but is emitted through the innocence
of Shri Shiva.

55:05.145 --> 55:12.803
Now I think in next lecture of Shiva
I’ll talk about innocence to you,

55:13.004 --> 55:18.062
but for this one you have to understand
the detachment,

55:18.263 --> 55:21.701
the detachment that should evolve within.

55:21.902 --> 55:24.577
It cannot be forced, but through meditation

55:24.778 --> 55:30.726
you can develop that detachment within you,
which will be really joy giving.

55:30.927 --> 55:34.126
So many qualities of Shiva can be
described,

55:34.334 --> 55:40.282
and I think in so many lectures I have told
you about Him.

55:40.483 --> 55:47.459
I have to just say that you should have
also collective meditation

55:47.660 --> 55:51.946
in your ashrams. Will be a good idea

55:52.147 --> 55:56.041
if you can try collective meditation,
will be nice.

55:56.242 --> 55:58.787
But you don’t have to give vibrations
to anyone.

55:58.988 --> 56:02.283
You don’t have to look after the chakras
of others.

56:02.484 --> 56:05.436
You just bother, yourself, what’s wrong
with you.

56:05.637 --> 56:10.776
And now whatever is the solution for your
ascent you should do it,

56:10.977 --> 56:18.508
because the responsibility of the whole
world rests on Sahaja Yogis.

56:18.709 --> 56:23.322
This you know, that there’s no way out
without Sahaja Yoga.

56:23.523 --> 56:28.595
To save humanity from all kinds
of problems,

56:28.796 --> 56:31.831
Sahaja Yoga has come on this earth.

56:32.032 --> 56:37.684
So it is your responsibility to keep
yourself in proper shape,

56:37.885 --> 56:39.974
as far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned,

56:40.175 --> 56:43.468
get rid of your left and get rid of your
right,

56:43.669 --> 56:49.483
and then to spread Sahaja Yoga, not
by bombastic words

56:49.684 --> 56:53.901
or aggressiveness, but with love and
compassion.

56:54.102 --> 56:57.581
I’m sure we have done a lot, we have
achieved a lot,

56:57.782 --> 57:01.449
but there are still some points here
and there

57:01.650 --> 57:05.731
which is a very unpleasant task for me
to correct them.

57:05.932 --> 57:10.451
But whatever it is I have to say that
it’s working,

57:10.652 --> 57:14.535
and everybody should look at themselves

57:14.736 --> 57:17.641
and feel happy from where they have
come here,

57:17.842 --> 57:19.770
and how far we have to go.

57:19.971 --> 57:22.693
May God bless you all.
