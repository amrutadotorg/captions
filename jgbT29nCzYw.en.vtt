00:03:19.782 --> 00:03:23.680
Today we have gathered here

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:31.810
to do the Puja to Sadashiva.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:43.890
The One, which is reflected within us,
is the Shiva,

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:49.204
which is the pure Spirit.

00:03:52.193 --> 00:03:57.590
This pure Spirit within us is
the reflection

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.503
of God Almighty, Sadashiva.

00:04:05.914 --> 00:04:15.864
It’s like the sun that falls in the water

00:04:16.065 --> 00:04:21.905
and gives a clear reflection.

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.370
Or else it falls on the stone,

00:04:27.571 --> 00:04:31.995
it doesn’t give any reflection at all.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.925
If you have, say, the mirror,

00:04:36.126 --> 00:04:41.259
the sun will not only fall on the mirror

00:04:41.483 --> 00:04:48.187
but will reflect back its light.

00:04:49.072 --> 00:04:53.019
In the same way in the human beings

00:04:53.220 --> 00:05:05.369
the reflection of God Almighty is expressed
in the way your personality is.

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:11.980
If your personality is clean and clear,
innocent,

00:05:12.181 --> 00:05:17.370
then the reflection could be like a mirror.

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:28.200
Thus the saintly people, they reflect God
Almighty in the proper manner,

00:05:28.401 --> 00:05:36.886
in the sense that their own identification
with wrong things is no more.

00:05:37.087 --> 00:05:41.068
When there is no such identification

00:05:41.283 --> 00:05:48.930
and when a person is absolutely the pure
Spirit,

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:55.280
then the reflection of God reflects into
others.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:01.933
Luckily you all have got your Self
Realization.

00:06:02.134 --> 00:06:05.839
That means the reflection of God Almighty

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.459
is already working into your attention.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:21.825
The attention is enlightened by the power
of the Spirit.

00:06:22.026 --> 00:06:29.899
The power of the Spirit is that it is
a reflection.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:37.076
That means the reflection is never
identified

00:06:37.277 --> 00:06:44.867
with the mirror or with the water.

00:06:45.902 --> 00:06:51.177
It is there till the sun shines,

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:57.310
and when there is no sun there is
no reflection.

00:06:57.803 --> 00:07:10.291
So when you are in Sahaja Yoga you have
cleansed out yourself.

00:07:10.492 --> 00:07:14.190
Your Kundalini has also cleansed you,

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:17.690
and now you are pure personalities.

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:25.080
That’s why this reflection is clearer and
clearer,

00:07:25.281 --> 00:07:29.049
and people see it; see it on your face;

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:33.379
they see it in your body; they see it
in your work;

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.740
in your behaviour; in everywhere.

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:45.960
It is difficult for people to really
believe in themselves,

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:51.110
that they could be the reflection of God
Almighty.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:57.957
They have some sort of a, complexes about
themselves I think,

00:07:58.158 --> 00:08:05.041
that they cannot understand how they have
suddenly become

00:08:05.242 --> 00:08:09.029
the reflection of God Almighty,

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:18.313
but they have a capacity; and they can
become

00:08:18.514 --> 00:08:22.440
the reflection of God Almighty,

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.200
for which they have to have faith
in themselves,

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:32.719
faith in their ascent, to believe that we
have become that.

00:08:35.407 --> 00:08:41.867
The confidence in Sahaja Yoga is very
important.

00:08:42.068 --> 00:08:47.329
Without the full confidence you cannot
achieve your ascent.

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:49.868
That you have seen even in my lectures,

00:08:50.069 --> 00:08:55.300
I have to tell them that we have to have
full self-confidence.

00:08:55.500 --> 00:09:02.469
But confidence doesn’t mean by any chance
your ego, your aggressiveness.

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:08.649
If you are confident, you are least
aggressive.

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:13.774
There is a story, a Chinese story, very
interesting one:

00:09:13.987 --> 00:09:24.728
that one king wanted his cocks to win in
the race they have about the cock-fighting.

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:30.484
So somebody said that “There is a saint,
if you can take your cocks to him,

00:09:30.685 --> 00:09:37.580
he’ll make them so strong that they will
definitely win this race.”

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:41.809
So he took his two cocks and gave it to
the saint and he said,

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:48.958
“I want you to give them all the strength
to fight this race.”

00:09:49.159 --> 00:09:55.595
After one month the king came and took
these two cocks,

00:09:55.796 --> 00:10:00.886
and put them in the arena where there were
many other cocks also.

00:10:01.087 --> 00:10:09.838
So the cocks started fighting and attacking
these two cocks,

00:10:10.039 --> 00:10:12.405
but these two cocks were just standing

00:10:12.606 --> 00:10:18.440
very patiently, absolutely calm and quiet.

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:25.416
Any kind of attack they were just looking
at it as a fun,

00:10:25.617 --> 00:10:29.820
and all the cocks got tired and they ran
away from the arena,

00:10:30.021 --> 00:10:34.958
and that’s how these two cocks won
the game.

00:10:35.159 --> 00:10:38.760
This is what it is for us to understand,

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:44.382
that for a person who is detached he can
never be attacked.

00:10:44.583 --> 00:10:49.335
We are attacked by so many we have.

00:10:49.536 --> 00:10:55.199
Firstly our family, then our country,

00:10:55.400 --> 00:11:00.000
then our religion, then all kinds of thing,
racialism.

00:11:00.201 --> 00:11:03.599
All these identifications really make
us weak,

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.225
because they attack us all the time

00:11:06.426 --> 00:11:11.380
and put confusion into the minds of Sahaja
Yogis, I have seen.

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:15.000
The reason is, you must have confidence
in Sahaja Yoga

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:19.850
and confidence in yourself, that you are
on the right path

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:25.290
and that you are now saved, and nobody
can attack you

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:29.569
because you have the complete protection
of the Divine.

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:31.933
People may follow any religion,

00:11:32.134 --> 00:11:35.230
they may follow any guru, they may follow
anything,

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:40.380
but they have fear all the time that
we’ll be attacked,

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.732
and they’re afraid to say things, which
they should say.

00:11:43.933 --> 00:11:49.309
They have no discretion even to know what
is to be said.

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:57.710
With the proper understanding that you are
the pure Spirit,

00:11:57.911 --> 00:12:02.283
if you believe in that then you’ll be
surprised

00:12:02.484 --> 00:12:09.634
that you will be very confident about what
you are doing.

00:12:09.835 --> 00:12:17.395
In that way we can say that we have also
another great advantage –

00:12:17.596 --> 00:12:21.492
is that we are in the collective.

00:12:21.693 --> 00:12:28.060
We can find out in the collective how are
we behaving.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.379
What is the reaction in the collective?

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:37.598
In the collective it’s a person who is very
subtle,

00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:41.586
he need not talk too much, he need not
say much.

00:12:41.787 --> 00:12:45.190
He could stand like the cocks I told you
about,

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:48.714
but his depth can be felt.

00:12:48.915 --> 00:12:52.350
You can feel a person of that caliber,

00:12:52.551 --> 00:12:57.499
that he’s such a deep person, that he
doesn’t want to aggress.

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:01.180
He feels protected within himself.

00:13:01.381 --> 00:13:03.870
So this protection we have to feel,

00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:07.804
not mentally but within ourselves,

00:13:08.005 --> 00:13:11.280
and once you have that gravity,

00:13:11.486 --> 00:13:16.439
that feeling, nobody can attack you.

00:13:16.755 --> 00:13:24.263
The attacking person himself is insecure;
or maybe he is ill-bred;

00:13:24.464 --> 00:13:28.720
maybe he is not yet a Sahaja Yogi.

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:36.666
So you have to just have a kind of
a gracious view

00:13:36.885 --> 00:13:42.631
about the person. Like Shiva was.

00:13:42.832 --> 00:13:45.536
We should say Sadashiva’s character
is known,

00:13:45.737 --> 00:13:50.459
that He is the one who used to forgive
anyone.

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:53.790
Anybody who did penance like standing
on their heads

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:59.524
or standing on one foot or not eating their
food or all kinds of penances,

00:13:59.725 --> 00:14:06.359
He used to be so disgusted that He would
say: “Alright, what do you want? Take it!”

00:14:06.677 --> 00:14:10.651
And He also gave blessings to manyrakshasas

00:14:10.852 --> 00:14:14.846
as you have heard and so many rakshasas
were blessed by Him,

00:14:15.047 --> 00:14:20.580
because He got fed up with their penances.

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:32.060
There were so many stories about Sadashiva
giving a blessing to people.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:37.120
Even to Ravana, which is a very interesting
story about Ravana,

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:41.119
that Ravana did lots of penance. I don’t
know what he did,

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:47.721
how much he must have starved with his
ten heads and what …

00:14:47.922 --> 00:14:53.490
I mean, if one mouth is there you feel so
hungry – with ten mouths!

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:57.968
I don’t know what he must have done

00:14:58.169 --> 00:15:01.709
to do that kind of a penance that Shiva
just got fed up, you see.

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:03.969
His compassion is so great He thought:

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:06.725
“Let this man have whatever he likes.”

00:15:06.926 --> 00:15:11.510
So Ravana went to Shiva and Shiva said:
“What do you want?

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:17.447
Why are you doing all this to yourself?”
So he said that

00:15:17.648 --> 00:15:20.836
“I want to have a blessing”. He said:
“What blessing?”

00:15:21.037 --> 00:15:24.710
“First you promise that whatever I ask for,
you will give me.”

00:15:24.911 --> 00:15:27.880
He said: “Of course. If it is in my power,
I’ll give”.

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:30.280
It’s a very interesting story.

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:36.270
So he said: “I want to have your wife”.

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:39.420
Because he knew His wife is Adi Shakti,

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:44.759
and if he gets the Adi Shakti as a partner
with him,

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.285
he can do wonders.

00:15:47.486 --> 00:15:56.294
So he asked that: “I should get your wife
as my partner.”

00:15:58.056 --> 00:16:02.479
Now, it was very difficult, you see, for
Him to take such a decision

00:16:02.704 --> 00:16:09.010
to give in to this devil, but in compassion
He did it.

00:16:09.211 --> 00:16:12.452
And all these events you see really show

00:16:12.653 --> 00:16:18.952
that how His compassion works out things.

00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:28.024
As a result it was decided that

00:16:28.225 --> 00:16:35.190
His wife Parvati had to go with this
horrible fellow.

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:43.875
But Parvati’s sister (brother) was Shri
Vishnu, that is Shri Krishna,

00:16:44.076 --> 00:16:50.158
and He said to Himself that: “I can’t allow

00:16:50.359 --> 00:16:53.830
my sister to go with this devil. I must do
something about it.”

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:59.938
The most mischievous one is Shri Krishna.
So what He did was

00:17:00.139 --> 00:17:06.220
to make him feel like going for the
bathroom.

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:09.076
So he felt shy, he put the lady on one side

00:17:09.277 --> 00:17:16.755
and he went to the bathroom. Now Shiva
had warned him that:

00:17:16.956 --> 00:17:20.040
“You’d better be careful, because this
Mother Earth

00:17:20.241 --> 00:17:25.117
is the mother of this lady, and never put
Her on the Mother Earth.

00:17:25.318 --> 00:17:29.790
You must carry Him (Her) all the time
on your back.”

00:17:29.991 --> 00:17:34.480
So when he reached a certain point

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:39.433
this Shri Krishna created a mischief,

00:17:39.634 --> 00:17:41.969
and he felt like going.

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:44.186
So he put Her down. As soon as he put
Her down,

00:17:44.387 --> 00:17:50.030
the Mother Earth sucked Her in and he
didn’t know what to do.

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:53.108
Second time again he tried.

00:17:53.309 --> 00:17:57.334
And he again went to Shiva and he said:

00:17:57.535 --> 00:18:02.130
“See now, this is what you have promised,
and this is what he is doing.”

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:07.159
So He said: “I had warned you that Her
brother is a very mischievous fellow

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:11.410
and He’ll somehow or other manage,
so you’d better be careful.

00:18:11.611 --> 00:18:15.164
This time you don’t listen to him.

00:18:15.365 --> 00:18:19.094
Don’t put Her on the ground, whatever
it may be.”

00:18:19.295 --> 00:18:26.963
So this time he did another try,

00:18:27.164 --> 00:18:31.278
we can say, and carried Her on his back.

00:18:31.479 --> 00:18:33.745
Suddenly he found a little boy.

00:18:33.946 --> 00:18:39.010
It was Shri Krishna himself laughing
at him.

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:41.600
He said: “Why are you laughing at me?”

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:47.020
“Oh my, why are you carrying this old woman
on your back?

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:49.900
She has no ornaments.” He said: “She’s
the Goddess.”

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:53.360
He said: “No. She has no ornaments.
She’s wearing nothing.

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:55.170
How can She be the Goddess?”

00:18:55.370 --> 00:19:00.420
So you see in India that’s a … proverb
we use.

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:05.189
Somebody, some lady who has, who lives
without any ornaments or anything,

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:08.240
that she’s like the Lanka Parvati.

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:14.030
So he was carrying Her to Lanka. And
when he looked at Her up,

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:19.753
he saw a very old woman without any teeth
you know, laughing at him.

00:19:19.954 --> 00:19:26.436
He got such a fright he threw Her away.
That’s Mahamaya!

00:19:27.448 --> 00:19:31.620
Then the third situation was, he went
and told that:

00:19:31.822 --> 00:19:35.551
“You’d better tell your wife that She’s not
to listen to anybody,

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:38.800
and you’d better see that you give me
your wife itself.”

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.540
He said: “Alright, She’ll be born in Lanka
and you can marry Her.”

00:19:42.741 --> 00:19:48.540
Her name was Mandodari. Now the great
story goes on like that.

00:19:48.741 --> 00:19:53.654
But this Mandodari was the great worshipper
of Vishnu,

00:19:53.855 --> 00:19:59.500
and at the time when Rama came, you see,
to kill him.

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:04.260
All this was organised by Mandodari
Herself.

00:20:04.461 --> 00:20:10.384
She knows, knew that if Shri Rama
kills Ravana

00:20:10.585 --> 00:20:15.702
he will get his liberation from these ideas
about women;

00:20:15.903 --> 00:20:21.139
the way he was running after Sita and doing
all these things.

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:27.013
She actually wanted that something should
happen that he should take another birth,

00:20:27.214 --> 00:20:35.269
and he should get rid of these notions
of looking after beautiful women,

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:39.029
and the way he brought Sitaji there.

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:42.164
She was against it completely, but he
would not listen.

00:20:42.365 --> 00:20:49.363
So the war took place, and in the war he
was killed by Shri Rama.

00:20:49.564 --> 00:21:03.628
All this episode came because of the
unlimited compassion of Shri Shiva.

00:21:04.025 --> 00:21:11.285
His compassion is to look at, looks very
illogical sometimes,

00:21:11.486 --> 00:21:14.024
but there’s a big logic behind it.

00:21:14.225 --> 00:21:18.265
The logic is that whatever He does

00:21:18.466 --> 00:21:28.461
brings forth a kind of a solution of the
problem.

00:21:28.945 --> 00:21:34.945
For example, there was a war on, and
the war was going on,

00:21:35.154 --> 00:21:43.899
and that time there was a problem because
there was one horrible devil

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:49.539
who was given blessings by Shri Shiva

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:53.273
that: “Nobody can kill you.”

00:21:53.474 --> 00:22:01.172
He had given also blessings - as they call
varadan - to another saint,

00:22:01.373 --> 00:22:06.415
who said: “I want to sleep now and nobody
should disturb me.”

00:22:06.616 --> 00:22:08.880
So he was given a blessing:

00:22:09.081 --> 00:22:11.871
“Anybody who disturbs you in your sleep,

00:22:12.072 --> 00:22:18.411
you can just look at that person and that
will be, he’ll be reduced to ashes.”

00:22:18.612 --> 00:22:24.456
So these two now, when the war started,
you see, Shri Krishna thought,

00:22:24.657 --> 00:22:33.320
“Best thing is to kill this devil with
the same blessings

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:37.932
that the saint has got.” So He played

00:22:38.133 --> 00:22:43.437
and He started running away from
the battlefield;

00:22:43.638 --> 00:22:49.325
and that’s why He’s called

00:22:51.338 --> 00:22:55.914
as a warrior who has ran out of the field.

00:22:56.115 --> 00:23:02.740
Ranchordas – the one who runs away
out of the field of battle.

00:23:03.631 --> 00:23:09.027
And when He was running He was wearing
a shawl, Shri Krishna.

00:23:09.228 --> 00:23:12.199
He just stealthily entered into the cave

00:23:12.415 --> 00:23:18.987
and there’s another saint was sleeping and
put His shawl on top of that.

00:23:19.257 --> 00:23:23.439
So when He put the shawl on top of him,

00:23:24.662 --> 00:23:31.582
the gentleman, I mean, the devil who was
following Him, the satanic fellow,

00:23:31.783 --> 00:23:38.152
he reached that place and saw the same
shawl

00:23:38.353 --> 00:23:41.470
and he said: “Oh, so now you are tired

00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:44.943
and now you are sleeping here. I’ll put
you right!”

00:23:45.144 --> 00:23:51.302
Without realising who was sleeping and he
pulled the shawl.

00:23:51.503 --> 00:23:57.026
And here the sleeping saint gets up and
looks at him,

00:23:57.227 --> 00:24:00.828
and they say with his third eye he burnt.

00:24:01.029 --> 00:24:05.037
So the solution came in. So the whole
play is like this,

00:24:05.238 --> 00:24:11.871
of three forces going on, just to show
ultimately the truth prevails.

00:24:12.087 --> 00:24:19.070
First is the, Shiva’s compassion, His
goodness, to one side.

00:24:19.271 --> 00:24:27.620
Then the play of Shri Krishna or say
Shri Vishnu of neutralizing it;

00:24:29.028 --> 00:24:41.062
and the third is the play of Brahma who
creates things and who produces things.

00:24:41.263 --> 00:24:44.803
All these three forces are playing,

00:24:45.004 --> 00:24:50.543
just to create an atmosphere for all of us
to feel

00:24:50.744 --> 00:24:55.846
that there is something else is to be done
to our human awareness.

00:24:56.047 --> 00:25:04.590
All they have evolved within us this desire
to seek the truth.

00:25:04.985 --> 00:25:09.608
Now on one side Shiva is extremely
compassionate,

00:25:09.809 --> 00:25:14.422
very kind even to asuras, the rakshasas.

00:25:14.623 --> 00:25:20.716
But on the other side He can be extremely
cruel.

00:25:20.917 --> 00:25:24.747
He can destroy the whole universe.

00:25:24.948 --> 00:25:28.667
If the people are so decadent,

00:25:28.868 --> 00:25:35.804
if the people do not take to spirituality,

00:25:36.948 --> 00:25:41.029
if their innocence is completely lost,

00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:46.886
if they do not get detached from all these
wrong identifications

00:25:47.087 --> 00:25:50.267
which are creating problems in this world,

00:25:50.468 --> 00:25:53.646
He destroys the whole universe.

00:25:53.847 --> 00:25:59.326
So as it is He is the spectator of the work
of Adi Shakti.

00:25:59.527 --> 00:26:02.770
He allows Her to do all this work,

00:26:02.984 --> 00:26:07.511
to create human beings, to give them
Realization, do all this.

00:26:07.712 --> 00:26:12.005
But in case He finds Her children,

00:26:12.206 --> 00:26:18.408
people who have been saved by Her,
are misbehaving

00:26:18.609 --> 00:26:22.741
or insulting or in any way destroying
Her work,

00:26:22.942 --> 00:26:29.822
He might get into a temper by which He can
destroy the whole universe.

00:26:30.385 --> 00:26:34.314
But I don’t think now there’s any chance
for Him to do that,

00:26:34.515 --> 00:26:38.384
because we have now Sahaja Yogis all over.

00:26:38.585 --> 00:26:42.960
But what I find amongst Sahaja Yogis
is this

00:26:43.161 --> 00:26:47.519
that some of the Sahaja Yogis grow
very fast.

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:55.179
Steadily, strongly, they achieve their
principle of Shiva Tattwa.

00:26:55.380 --> 00:27:03.130
The first achievement shows that from
inside they start getting detached.

00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:07.137
Now detachment is not mental. It’s not
mental.

00:27:07.338 --> 00:27:12.990
It is not that we have to take to some sort
of a sanyasa

00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:17.616
or we have to go to Himalayas, give up
our families and all that.

00:27:17.817 --> 00:27:25.950
But the detachment is within oneself. When
that detachment starts working,

00:27:26.151 --> 00:27:33.823
the first sign is that we become joyous,
we become happy.

00:27:34.024 --> 00:27:38.821
Now if you ask anyone: “Why are you
unhappy?”,

00:27:39.022 --> 00:27:45.711
he’ll talk about his wife, maybe his house,
maybe his children,

00:27:45.912 --> 00:27:53.376
maybe his country, maybe society, whatever
it is.

00:27:53.577 --> 00:28:00.357
So he gets absolutely upset, or maybe
very unhappy

00:28:00.558 --> 00:28:04.856
to see things happening around him.

00:28:05.057 --> 00:28:13.140
Now he is a realized soul this unhappiness
is not going to help him.

00:28:13.432 --> 00:28:19.443
What is needed is now to know that you
can correct

00:28:19.644 --> 00:28:27.552
all these ills of the society, of the
family, of the whole country,

00:28:27.753 --> 00:28:32.550
by transforming others, not by feeling bad.

00:28:32.751 --> 00:28:39.711
But while doing that, the main thing that
you should have is a complete detachment.

00:28:39.912 --> 00:28:43.960
I was amazed when I first started Sahaja
Yoga

00:28:44.161 --> 00:28:49.547
how people told me about their own
countrymen, country fellows,

00:28:49.748 --> 00:28:54.295
I was amazed how they told me about their
own religions,

00:28:54.496 --> 00:28:57.715
how wrong things they are doing.

00:28:57.916 --> 00:29:00.685
I didn’t know so much as they told me,

00:29:00.886 --> 00:29:04.483
and I thought that this is a detachment
that has come

00:29:04.684 --> 00:29:08.538
that they can see clearly what’s wrong;

00:29:08.739 --> 00:29:16.750
what’s wrong with my society, with
my people,

00:29:16.951 --> 00:29:22.963
with my relations, with my family, with my
country, with the whole world.

00:29:23.164 --> 00:29:30.635
But is only possible if you are not
identified through any one of them,

00:29:30.836 --> 00:29:33.586
otherwise you will never see the defects.

00:29:33.787 --> 00:29:35.842
You’ll never see what’s wrong with
that person.

00:29:36.043 --> 00:29:39.711
You can never even see the chakras, which
are catching.

00:29:39.912 --> 00:29:45.255
So the first thing that should happen
is detachment.

00:29:45.456 --> 00:29:49.693
Now how to achieve detachment is the point.

00:29:49.894 --> 00:29:53.357
Many people ask me, “Mother, how do you
get detached?”

00:29:53.558 --> 00:29:56.825
Because I am not attached you see, so I’m
already detached.

00:29:57.026 --> 00:29:59.548
I don’t know how to do that way.

00:29:59.749 --> 00:30:05.766
But for you people I would say,
to understand yourself

00:30:05.967 --> 00:30:08.389
you should introspect.

00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:14.307
Try to find out to what thing am I
attached. Why am I miserable?

00:30:14.508 --> 00:30:18.367
For whom am I worried? Why should I worry?

00:30:18.568 --> 00:30:22.841
Some things you see which were never
very important,

00:30:23.042 --> 00:30:25.668
they become very important to certain
Sahaja Yogis.

00:30:25.869 --> 00:30:31.510
For example I was told that in the West,
people don’t care

00:30:34.036 --> 00:30:39.389
so much for their children. But as soon
as they get Realization

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:46.509
they just get attached to their children,
like as if with some glue.

00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:49.630
They cannot think what is good for
their children.

00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:57.065
Everything about children they think is
their primary duty.

00:30:57.265 --> 00:31:03.032
The other day I was surprised when they
told me that it’s the parents

00:31:03.233 --> 00:31:10.200
who want to come after the Birthday Puja.
I was shocked.

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:13.171
I mean, just on the way is Birthday Puja.

00:31:13.372 --> 00:31:19.180
Why should the parents want to come
after that?

00:31:19.697 --> 00:31:22.329
When I told Yogi he said: “Mother,

00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:25.629
we’ll be very happy if they are here, and
they should be.

00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:28.592
Because it will help the children, it will
help the parents.”

00:31:28.793 --> 00:31:32.264
But the whole now attention goes
to the children,

00:31:32.465 --> 00:31:36.790
that “We must leave the children there
and we must look after them”,

00:31:36.991 --> 00:31:40.351
and that’s the only thing.

00:31:42.787 --> 00:31:48.600
So the attachment to children will
definitely make you do such things,

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:53.430
which are not good, not good for you.

00:31:53.692 --> 00:31:58.784
So this new attachment starts after Sahaja
Yoga, I’ve seen, very common.

00:31:58.985 --> 00:32:02.486
Then another attachment is, say, to your
family.

00:32:02.687 --> 00:32:06.855
Normally there are no such things
in the West.

00:32:07.056 --> 00:32:09.309
People are not attached to their family
much, you see.

00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:12.798
They drink, they do all kinds of things.

00:32:12.999 --> 00:32:17.640
Suddenly they become self-realized

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:23.845
and it’s like a boomerang, they come back
to the family

00:32:24.046 --> 00:32:28.440
It is so attached to the family, attached
to the house,

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:32.763
attached to everything. I just can’t
understand.

00:32:32.964 --> 00:32:37.510
If you are becoming the pure Spirit then
you are detached,

00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:43.459
because you are just a reflection, but
the reflection of God Almighty.

00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:47.795
So all these identifications drop out.

00:32:47.996 --> 00:32:50.499
Now one may say, “How? How to drop it out?”

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:52.169
I’ve never dropped them,

00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:55.590
but still I can suggest certain things,
which you can try.

00:32:55.790 --> 00:32:59.390
First is meditation.

00:32:59.698 --> 00:33:03.186
You should discover about yourself, what’s
wrong with you,

00:33:03.387 --> 00:33:07.719
which side is catching, is it right or left
side.

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:10.180
With meditation you can find out.

00:33:10.381 --> 00:33:14.099
Are you attached to money, are you
attached to business,

00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:19.476
are you attached to your family, are you
attached to your country

00:33:19.677 --> 00:33:25.510
in a way which is not Sahaj

00:33:25.711 --> 00:33:28.815
or to your culture, which is not Sahaj?

00:33:29.016 --> 00:33:36.006
Then try to get rid of this attachment
by meditation.

00:33:36.207 --> 00:33:40.343
You know how to get rid of the right
and the left.

00:33:40.544 --> 00:33:44.473
This attachment will show on your
fingertips,

00:33:44.674 --> 00:33:49.432
and you have to see for yourself what
centres you are catching,

00:33:49.633 --> 00:33:55.969
in which way are you in trouble. And then
you can clarify it

00:33:56.170 --> 00:34:01.820
very simply by taking a very simple Sahaj
treatment.

00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:08.191
I think here we fail, that once we get
attached to something,

00:34:08.392 --> 00:34:10.605
we don’t even think we are getting
attached.

00:34:10.806 --> 00:34:12.489
We think we are doing very great thing

00:34:12.690 --> 00:34:16.270
because now we love this person, love
that person,

00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:20.600
Shiva’s qualities, the compassion part.

00:34:20.801 --> 00:34:24.731
You start getting attached to people.

00:34:24.932 --> 00:34:29.277
That is no compassion. That is no
compassion of any kind.

00:34:29.478 --> 00:34:33.137
To be attached to any such things is
no compassion,

00:34:33.342 --> 00:34:37.381
and you cannot have compassion of Shiva,

00:34:37.582 --> 00:34:40.908
though people think it is the Shiva’s
compassion that is working within us.

00:34:41.109 --> 00:34:52.278
It’s not, because that compassion is very
pure.

00:34:52.497 --> 00:34:56.772
It is like as I’ve told you many a times,
it’s like the sap in the tree

00:34:56.973 --> 00:35:02.603
which rises and goes to various parts
of the tree,

00:35:02.804 --> 00:35:09.362
and then either it evaporates or goes down
into Mother Earth. It’s not attached.

00:35:09.563 --> 00:35:16.807
If it gets attached to one flower or to one
leaf or to one fruit,

00:35:17.008 --> 00:35:24.081
then the whole tree will suffer and also
the flower will disappear.

00:35:24.282 --> 00:35:33.087
So this kind of attachment to a particular
thing, to a particular idea is not proper.

00:35:33.288 --> 00:35:41.342
In Sahaja Yoga I’ve found people are very
adaptable and understand

00:35:41.543 --> 00:35:46.395
what they should do, but the main thing
is meditation.

00:35:46.596 --> 00:35:49.960
In meditating on your heart, on the Shiva
Tattwa,

00:35:50.169 --> 00:35:54.490
on the principle of Shiva, you can
definitely detach,

00:35:54.691 --> 00:36:01.602
and then the joy will be the maximum,
joy will be the maximum.

00:36:01.803 --> 00:36:05.153
I’ve seen people have interest in, say,
food

00:36:05.354 --> 00:36:12.343
or in clothes or in house, anything.

00:36:12.544 --> 00:36:18.467
You can have interest, you should have
interest, but in that interest

00:36:18.668 --> 00:36:24.610
there should be enlightenment, that you
cannot get attached to it.

00:36:25.015 --> 00:36:32.062
Some people, say, who are say, from South
India, they don’t like North Indian food.

00:36:32.263 --> 00:36:35.789
Those who are from North India don’t like
South Indian.

00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:40.039
It’s a big problem. I asked the people
in Indian Airlines:

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:42.359
“Why don’t you have some standard food?”

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:45.314
He said: “What is the standard food
of India? Tell me.”

00:36:45.515 --> 00:36:47.384
But it was a question.

00:36:47.585 --> 00:36:50.995
Indians are very particular about
the taste and food.

00:36:51.196 --> 00:36:56.335
So it’s a fact we don’t have any standard
food in India.

00:36:56.536 --> 00:36:59.715
But in the same way, we can say in so many
other ways

00:36:59.916 --> 00:37:09.284
that in the West people run after things,
which are not necessary.

00:37:09.485 --> 00:37:14.226
They do things just out of fashion, or
I don’t know,

00:37:14.427 --> 00:37:17.474
because their personality is not grown-up.

00:37:17.675 --> 00:37:24.523
If your personality is grown up then you
see everything, everything

00:37:24.724 --> 00:37:28.360
from an angle, which is much higher
than others,

00:37:28.561 --> 00:37:31.108
and you don’t get dissolved with others.

00:37:31.309 --> 00:37:37.193
What you know is much higher, much greater
and much more joy giving.

00:37:37.394 --> 00:37:41.974
Now these attachments, people think that
it’s very joy giving.

00:37:42.175 --> 00:37:49.213
If you get a child and if you have say,
a wife and everything, are joy giving.

00:37:49.414 --> 00:37:51.143
It’s a very wrong idea.

00:37:51.344 --> 00:37:55.870
The joy comes from your own source
of your Spirit.

00:37:56.071 --> 00:38:00.940
Whether your husband is good, whether
your children are good or bad,

00:38:01.141 --> 00:38:05.222
whatever they are, they cannot give you
joy.

00:38:05.423 --> 00:38:08.853
It’s only you can enjoy yourself,

00:38:09.054 --> 00:38:15.406
and this is why one becomes very forgiving.

00:38:15.607 --> 00:38:21.287
When nobody can harm you, then whom are
you going to be angry with?

00:38:21.488 --> 00:38:24.430
That is another great quality of Sadashiva,

00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:26.824
is that He is extremely forgiving.

00:38:27.025 --> 00:38:32.958
He goes up to a point, till He destroys
the whole work of Adi Shakti.

00:38:33.159 --> 00:38:36.533
But otherwise He is very, very forgiving,

00:38:36.734 --> 00:38:40.720
and He also is very balanced about it.

00:38:40.921 --> 00:38:44.732
Once the Adi Shakti got very angry with
the whole world,

00:38:44.933 --> 00:38:49.348
was so decadent and all that and She
started destroying everything.

00:38:49.549 --> 00:38:52.590
So He put a little child under Her feet,

00:38:52.791 --> 00:38:56.093
and such a big tongue came out with
such a shock,

00:38:56.294 --> 00:38:59.780
She stopped Her destruction.

00:38:59.981 --> 00:39:04.164
So His ways are such that a person

00:39:04.365 --> 00:39:10.587
who is to develop the Shiva principle
within himself

00:39:10.788 --> 00:39:14.254
should be extremely forgiving.

00:39:14.455 --> 00:39:18.957
I know there are people who are very cruel
and who are very tortur.

00:39:19.158 --> 00:39:23.908
If you cannot bear it, alright, finish
it off.

00:39:24.109 --> 00:39:27.823
I’ll stand by you there; but if you can
bear it

00:39:28.024 --> 00:39:34.371
is better to bear, and undergo this
experience of bearing it,

00:39:34.572 --> 00:39:39.981
because it’s not difficult to bear than
to get out of it.

00:39:40.182 --> 00:39:42.625
For example, a lady came to me, and
she said:

00:39:42.826 --> 00:39:45.724
“I’m going to divorce my husband.”
I said: “Why?”

00:39:45.925 --> 00:39:49.783
“Because he comes home very late and
I get very little of him.”

00:39:49.984 --> 00:39:56.358
But I said, “When you divorce you’ll not
get him at all! What’s the logic?

00:39:56.559 --> 00:40:00.581
At least now you see him, whatever it is,
whenever, whatever the time is there.

00:40:00.782 --> 00:40:06.199
But this is no solution. If you divorce him
you’ll never see him.

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:09.233
So what’s the use of such a divorce?”

00:40:09.434 --> 00:40:15.573
So many things like that can be understood
once you are a detached person,

00:40:15.774 --> 00:40:18.744
that you are not to be attached
to anything.

00:40:18.945 --> 00:40:24.442
Now who can aggress you if you are not
attached to anyone?

00:40:24.643 --> 00:40:28.685
Nobody can. Only thing when you feel

00:40:28.886 --> 00:40:32.645
that you have to protest, you should,
but with detachment.

00:40:32.846 --> 00:40:40.418
In protest also is important to absolutely
to have a complete detachment.

00:40:40.619 --> 00:40:47.768
Now the main problem before us today
is something else:

00:40:47.969 --> 00:40:53.719
is that we all have to ascend,

00:40:54.393 --> 00:41:02.379
and ascend with equal strength.

00:41:03.101 --> 00:41:11.990
There’s a story about some birds who were
caught in a net,

00:41:12.191 --> 00:41:17.394
so they decided that we should get out
of this net, and they tried.

00:41:17.595 --> 00:41:23.023
Everybody tried to get out, but nobody
individually could work it out.

00:41:23.224 --> 00:41:27.975
So they all decided to fly together, “One,
two, three, go!”,

00:41:28.176 --> 00:41:31.964
and they took all that net with them.

00:41:32.165 --> 00:41:42.749
And they said, then they requested the rats
that “Please come and cut our net.”

00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:45.073
And they were freed.

00:41:45.274 --> 00:41:49.229
So if it can happen between the rats
and the birds,

00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:51.732
why not between us?

00:41:51.933 --> 00:41:56.886
So in collectivity, you’ll be amazed,

00:41:57.087 --> 00:42:02.249
in the collectivity how we could be helpful
and joyous with each other.

00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:05.103
Now say something is wrong

00:42:05.304 --> 00:42:09.664
with your mother, father, sisters,
somebody, doesn’t matter.

00:42:09.865 --> 00:42:14.590
After all you have the ocean of joy here
with the collectivity,

00:42:14.791 --> 00:42:16.766
and your problems can be solved

00:42:16.967 --> 00:42:21.190
if collectively, if you want to solve
your problem.

00:42:21.391 --> 00:42:24.647
So we have to depend on the collectivity,

00:42:24.848 --> 00:42:28.254
very much to be one with the collective.

00:42:28.455 --> 00:42:33.728
I feel once you jump into the sea of Sahaj,

00:42:33.929 --> 00:42:36.755
the joy itself draws you together.

00:42:36.956 --> 00:42:40.426
Meeting each other is such a joyous thing!

00:42:40.627 --> 00:42:43.237
We have had so many experiences of that,

00:42:43.438 --> 00:42:48.275
of Sahaja Yogis who have told me how
happy they were to find

00:42:48.476 --> 00:42:54.740
Sahaja Yogis somewhere out of the blue,
and how they felt happy.

00:42:54.941 --> 00:43:04.833
So this tie between the Sahaja Yogis is
really the most joyous channel,

00:43:05.034 --> 00:43:12.149
and that is what is the source we should
say, of our becoming one together.

00:43:12.350 --> 00:43:16.355
Once you start enjoying each other…

00:43:17.394 --> 00:43:21.367
I’ve told you once a story of a great
poet in India

00:43:21.568 --> 00:43:26.258
whose name was Namdeva, who was a tailor.

00:43:26.459 --> 00:43:34.165
And there was another one who was
a… potter.

00:43:34.366 --> 00:43:37.294
Sometimes I miss out in English words.

00:43:37.495 --> 00:43:47.387
This potter was another poet and he was
called as Gorakumbhar.

00:43:47.657 --> 00:43:50.706
So when Namdeva went to meet him –

00:43:50.907 --> 00:43:54.138
a saint only feels like meeting a saint –

00:43:54.339 --> 00:44:02.521
looked at him, and he just stood back and
then he said a beautiful couplet.

00:44:02.722 --> 00:44:09.297
He says that: “I came here to see the form,
formless Chaitanya,

00:44:09.498 --> 00:44:14.494
but here the Chaitanya is in the form” -

00:44:14.725 --> 00:44:17.568
‘Nirgunachah beti allo sagunashi’ -

00:44:17.768 --> 00:44:22.649
“I came to see the formless, to see
the vibrations,

00:44:22.850 --> 00:44:27.427
but here the, it is in the form that
I see it.”

00:44:27.628 --> 00:44:31.862
Only a saint can say this to another saint.

00:44:32.063 --> 00:44:35.909
This kind of appreciation, this subtle
appreciation

00:44:36.110 --> 00:44:42.323
is only possible between the two saints,
or between the many.

00:44:42.524 --> 00:44:46.202
They don’t see he was kneading the clay;

00:44:46.403 --> 00:44:52.225
he was wearing a dirty dhoti, doing
that work.

00:44:52.426 --> 00:44:54.416
He never saw all these things.

00:44:54.617 --> 00:44:57.682
He never saw his body, face or anything,

00:44:57.883 --> 00:45:05.336
but he saw that the Divinity personified
in him.

00:45:06.796 --> 00:45:11.849
This sensitivity of feeling for other
Sahaja Yogis

00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:16.686
should really develop within you.

00:45:16.887 --> 00:45:22.287
Then you won’t care for nonsensical,
superficial things,

00:45:22.488 --> 00:45:28.184
and this is one of the great principles
of Shiva.

00:45:28.385 --> 00:45:33.855
He doesn’t bother. Now see, His hair
are all matted up,

00:45:34.056 --> 00:45:40.093
He sits on a fast-moving bull with both
the legs like that

00:45:40.294 --> 00:45:44.487
going for His wedding. Can you imagine?

00:45:45.083 --> 00:45:48.302
And all His friends, all His followers

00:45:48.511 --> 00:45:53.535
are somebody has only one eye, another
has only one hand,

00:45:53.736 --> 00:45:56.474
one is bent like that,

00:45:56.675 --> 00:46:04.738
because for Him the outside personality
doesn’t matter.

00:46:04.939 --> 00:46:10.524
What matters is the spirituality. Whether
you have one eye

00:46:10.833 --> 00:46:14.789
or whether you have a crooked body makes
no difference to Him.

00:46:14.990 --> 00:46:20.237
To Him all of them are His own people,

00:46:20.438 --> 00:46:26.038
because nothing that is superficial
attracts His attention,

00:46:26.244 --> 00:46:30.127
but the divinity in a person.

00:46:30.328 --> 00:46:35.382
We have so many ways of understanding
His principle,

00:46:35.583 --> 00:46:39.138
because He is all-pervading.

00:46:39.339 --> 00:46:46.735
If you feel compassion for someone
it works. It definitely works.

00:46:46.936 --> 00:46:57.841
Recently there was a case of some sort
of a, incurable disease in Mexico.

00:46:58.042 --> 00:46:59.855
And the lady, who was Mexican,

00:47:00.055 --> 00:47:03.235
who was working in the UN, she’s still
working in UN,

00:47:03.436 --> 00:47:09.401
she wrote to me two letters, that “Mother,
I’m going to lose my son

00:47:09.602 --> 00:47:15.908
because he has this horrible disease.”
I mean, just she wrote to me.

00:47:16.109 --> 00:47:20.365
I just felt such compassion for her,

00:47:20.566 --> 00:47:25.348
because she wrote a letter, which brought
tears to my eyes.

00:47:25.549 --> 00:47:31.013
And imagine, those tears have cured
that boy!

00:47:34.511 --> 00:47:39.513
(Shri Mataji speaks aside: “It has fallen.”
Then Hindi)

00:47:44.059 --> 00:47:47.131
Has cured that boy completely,

00:47:47.332 --> 00:47:54.624
and she wrote me a letter of, thanking
and all.

00:47:54.825 --> 00:47:59.940
I was amazed, because my compassion
is not mental.

00:48:00.141 --> 00:48:06.001
It just works, it’s just there, just flows
and works it out.

00:48:06.202 --> 00:48:10.037
In the same way you can also become that.

00:48:10.238 --> 00:48:13.120
I want you to have all my powers.

00:48:13.321 --> 00:48:16.472
But first is the compassion.

00:48:16.673 --> 00:48:19.991
And a Sahaja Yogi cannot ill-treat another
person, anyone.

00:48:20.192 --> 00:48:23.789
Whether he’s a Sahaja Yogi or not a Sahaja
Yogi, that’s not important.

00:48:23.997 --> 00:48:29.622
But nobody can aggress other Sahaja Yogis.

00:48:29.823 --> 00:48:39.203
If you say even he’s a non Sahaja Yogi,
Sahaja Yogis should never aggress.

00:48:39.404 --> 00:48:45.941
That’s not a sign of a Sahaja Yogi. Sahaja
Yogi is different.

00:48:46.142 --> 00:48:48.960
Like the other day somebody said, I said:
“You are very hot-tempered.”

00:48:49.161 --> 00:48:53.210
“Yes, yes, I am, when somebody provokes
me.”

00:48:53.411 --> 00:48:56.492
I said: “Everybody when he’s provoked
only gets angry.

00:48:56.693 --> 00:49:03.658
Only the mad are such who do not get angry
when they are provoked, you see.

00:49:03.859 --> 00:49:07.884
So if you get angry when you are provoked,
is nothing so great.

00:49:08.085 --> 00:49:11.166
Everybody gets angry like that, when you
are provoked.

00:49:11.367 --> 00:49:14.717
But if you say that if you are not provoked
then you will not get angry,

00:49:14.918 --> 00:49:17.514
that sort of a state is very different.”

00:49:17.715 --> 00:49:26.806
So what I find, that in the whole
atmosphere of today

00:49:27.007 --> 00:49:36.350
in the modern times, there’s a big struggle
going on,

00:49:36.731 --> 00:49:41.007
which is not Shiva’s culture.

00:49:41.236 --> 00:49:49.537
Shiva’s culture is the, I should say,
the Sahaj culture.

00:49:49.842 --> 00:49:57.567
If you are Sahaja Yogis you should have
compassion in you,

00:49:57.909 --> 00:50:02.879
understanding of others’ feelings;

00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:08.736
and also should have readiness to look
after

00:50:08.937 --> 00:50:12.859
not only Sahaja Yogis, also non Sahaja
Yogis,

00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:17.109
then your compassion will become effective.

00:50:17.310 --> 00:50:25.519
Now as you know today, the biggest problem
of today’s civilisation

00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:29.638
is the Western culture has gone to dogs.

00:50:29.839 --> 00:50:32.104
They are going, I mean when you read
the newspaper

00:50:32.304 --> 00:50:35.128
you are shocked the way things are
happening.

00:50:35.329 --> 00:50:40.403
I don’t know how many will realise it
before their destruction.

00:50:40.604 --> 00:50:42.922
It’s really self-destructing.

00:50:43.123 --> 00:50:51.221
On one side this is the self-indulgent and
permissive society, which is working.

00:50:51.422 --> 00:50:59.867
Now on the other side I find the Islamic
culture is trying to oppose it.

00:51:00.068 --> 00:51:03.834
That’s correct, their trying to oppose it
is correct,

00:51:04.035 --> 00:51:07.822
but the way they are opposing is creating
problems.

00:51:08.023 --> 00:51:11.658
If you oppress somebody – “Don’t do this,
don’t do that” –

00:51:11.859 --> 00:51:15.503
then they’ll do it much more. I’ll give
an example,

00:51:15.704 --> 00:51:23.036
that if you go into the north of India
the culture is more Islamic,

00:51:23.237 --> 00:51:28.853
and the people are very licentious and
all the time looking at women.

00:51:29.054 --> 00:51:34.093
Not all, but many; though they are say,
they are Hindus or they say this and that,

00:51:34.294 --> 00:51:37.566
but still they have all these bad habits,

00:51:37.767 --> 00:51:41.127
which have come from Islamic suppression.

00:51:41.328 --> 00:51:45.012
When a woman is completely covered

00:51:45.213 --> 00:51:49.031
and nobody can see her, they become much
more curious.

00:51:49.232 --> 00:51:54.046
I have some people who came to Bombay
and somebody was travelling with me,

00:51:54.247 --> 00:51:56.509
and he was looking at every woman
on the street.

00:51:56.710 --> 00:52:00.999
I tell, I said: “Your neck will break now,
the way you are going on.”

00:52:01.214 --> 00:52:03.158
But is a common practice there.

00:52:03.359 --> 00:52:06.456
Not only that, but this curiosity goes
too far

00:52:06.657 --> 00:52:09.527
and people can become extremely immoral,

00:52:09.728 --> 00:52:12.460
just like we are in the West.

00:52:12.661 --> 00:52:21.256
So the suppression of your desires is
also wrong.

00:52:21.457 --> 00:52:27.190
Also this culture, which outwardly
suppresses,

00:52:27.391 --> 00:52:31.671
but inwardly people are very immoral.

00:52:31.872 --> 00:52:37.114
Once I was travelling from Riyadh to London
and I went off to sleep.

00:52:37.315 --> 00:52:41.574
When I got up, I saw some other people
sitting there all very nicely dressed up

00:52:41.775 --> 00:52:47.239
with short skirts and women with –
all the bow ties and this and that -

00:52:47.450 --> 00:52:49.906
so I asked the air hostess, I said: “Did we
stop somewhere?”

00:52:50.107 --> 00:52:51.923
She said: “No, no, we have been going
directly.”

00:52:52.132 --> 00:52:55.682
I said: “Then who are these people?”
“Same.”

00:52:55.883 --> 00:52:58.621
“They are so much changed!” I mean,
I was surprised

00:52:58.822 --> 00:53:02.331
that they were wearing such long, these
chador and all that,

00:53:02.532 --> 00:53:06.692
and now here they are with all these
funny dresses.

00:53:06.893 --> 00:53:10.633
I couldn’t understand. So that’s what
happens.

00:53:10.834 --> 00:53:17.134
The curiosity created by suppression also
is not helpful.

00:53:17.335 --> 00:53:19.277
In Sahaja Yoga there’s no question
of suppression.

00:53:19.478 --> 00:53:23.401
You become innocent, just become innocent.

00:53:23.602 --> 00:53:26.277
That is the principle of Shiva.

00:53:26.478 --> 00:53:31.758
This Sahaj culture is in the centre. It has
neither too much of licentiousness

00:53:31.959 --> 00:53:35.809
nor too much of suppression, but it is
in the centre,

00:53:36.010 --> 00:53:42.006
which is the, Shiva’s greatest principle is
to be innocent.

00:53:42.207 --> 00:53:46.325
And this innocence just shines in you,
I have seen it.

00:53:46.526 --> 00:53:49.380
You people, whatever you might have
done before,

00:53:49.581 --> 00:53:54.481
but I see you are so pure. You don’t have
these stupid ideas

00:53:54.682 --> 00:54:01.379
of behaving in a manner that is so Western.

00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:05.756
Also, so many Islamic people I’ve seen who
have come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:54:05.957 --> 00:54:09.967
have become very, very Sahaj

00:54:10.168 --> 00:54:14.217
and are leading a very good life.

00:54:14.418 --> 00:54:19.764
We have some Iranians who sent me
letters of their confessions,

00:54:19.965 --> 00:54:23.567
and I was shocked. I never read them
because it was too much for me.

00:54:23.768 --> 00:54:28.795
And now I find them to be the most moral
people that we have.

00:54:28.996 --> 00:54:34.056
So going to one extreme is wrong, or
to another is wrong.

00:54:34.257 --> 00:54:39.428
But to be in the centre, in the Sahaj is
the best way to understand

00:54:39.629 --> 00:54:44.406
what is so important for life is morality.

00:54:44.607 --> 00:54:47.720
And that comes from your innocence.

00:54:47.921 --> 00:54:55.436
And that is the quality of, of course,
Shri Ganesha, who is the Son of Shiva,

00:54:55.637 --> 00:55:04.359
but is emitted through the innocence
of Shri Shiva.

00:55:05.145 --> 00:55:12.803
Now I think in next lecture of Shiva
I’ll talk about innocence to you,

00:55:13.004 --> 00:55:18.062
but for this one you have to understand
the detachment,

00:55:18.263 --> 00:55:21.701
the detachment that should evolve within.

00:55:21.902 --> 00:55:24.577
It cannot be forced, but through meditation

00:55:24.778 --> 00:55:30.726
you can develop that detachment within you,
which will be really joy giving.

00:55:30.927 --> 00:55:34.126
So many qualities of Shiva can be
described,

00:55:34.334 --> 00:55:40.282
and I think in so many lectures I have told
you about Him.

00:55:40.483 --> 00:55:47.459
I have to just say that you should have
also collective meditation

00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:51.946
in your ashrams. Will be a good idea

00:55:52.147 --> 00:55:56.041
if you can try collective meditation,
will be nice.

00:55:56.242 --> 00:55:58.787
But you don’t have to give vibrations
to anyone.

00:55:58.988 --> 00:56:02.283
You don’t have to look after the chakras
of others.

00:56:02.484 --> 00:56:05.436
You just bother, yourself, what’s wrong
with you.

00:56:05.637 --> 00:56:10.776
And now whatever is the solution for your
ascent you should do it,

00:56:10.977 --> 00:56:18.508
because the responsibility of the whole
world rests on Sahaja Yogis.

00:56:18.709 --> 00:56:23.322
This you know, that there’s no way out
without Sahaja Yoga.

00:56:23.523 --> 00:56:28.595
To save humanity from all kinds
of problems,

00:56:28.796 --> 00:56:31.831
Sahaja Yoga has come on this earth.

00:56:32.032 --> 00:56:37.684
So it is your responsibility to keep
yourself in proper shape,

00:56:37.885 --> 00:56:39.974
as far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned,

00:56:40.175 --> 00:56:43.468
get rid of your left and get rid of your
right,

00:56:43.669 --> 00:56:49.483
and then to spread Sahaja Yoga, not
by bombastic words

00:56:49.684 --> 00:56:53.901
or aggressiveness, but with love and
compassion.

00:56:54.102 --> 00:56:57.581
I’m sure we have done a lot, we have
achieved a lot,

00:56:57.782 --> 00:57:01.449
but there are still some points here
and there

00:57:01.650 --> 00:57:05.731
which is a very unpleasant task for me
to correct them.

00:57:05.932 --> 00:57:10.451
But whatever it is I have to say that
it’s working,

00:57:10.652 --> 00:57:14.535
and everybody should look at themselves

00:57:14.736 --> 00:57:17.641
and feel happy from where they have
come here,

00:57:17.842 --> 00:57:19.770
and how far we have to go.

00:57:19.971 --> 00:57:22.693
May God bless you all.
