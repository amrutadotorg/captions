00:00:01.222 --> 00:00:10.187
Today is a special day. There is
a combination of two things happening.

00:00:10.388 --> 00:00:14.937
[First I will speak in English then
Marathi].

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:21.366
Today is first in the morning time,
at 8:50 in the morning,

00:00:21.567 --> 00:00:27.760
was a very important date that started
at 8:50 in the morning,

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:31.558
called as Ratha Saptami – is the seventh
day.

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:38.128
And it is said that the Sun travels

00:00:42.147 --> 00:00:52.047
with his seven forces,

00:00:52.256 --> 00:01:00.238
or say, seven colours in a big chariot.

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:05.018
And today they celebrate this day
as a day when

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:11.488
the Sun travels with the divine vibrations
all over the world, and illumines.

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:19.525
But it was too early for anyone of you
to do this, so till -

00:01:19.726 --> 00:01:25.973
I got up very early of course, and worked
out that part for you.

00:01:26.231 --> 00:01:30.355
The second important thing which is
a combination,

00:01:30.556 --> 00:01:37.760
which is a very, very auspicious thing –
that you get on one day, two dates.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.264
One is Ratha Saptami, on that day
you cannot do havana,

00:01:42.465 --> 00:01:45.715
because it is the Surya already is there.

00:01:45.916 --> 00:01:48.530
So the second thing is, [which] today
we do,

00:01:48.731 --> 00:01:54.431
is a very great puja of Ashtami
(eighth day):

00:01:54.632 --> 00:01:59.688
is the day when the Goddess killed

00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:05.022
nine rakshasas together with Her eight
hands.

00:02:05.223 --> 00:02:07.358
So today is a very special day

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:11.171
for which a very special attention
is needed.

00:02:11.372 --> 00:02:15.511
It’s only at the behest of the bhaktas

00:02:15.712 --> 00:02:20.452
that the Goddess took Her form and killed
all these rakshasas.

00:02:20.653 --> 00:02:27.615
Also with Her eight hands, She killed
Mahishasura.

00:02:27.816 --> 00:02:32.155
That’s why She is called as Mahishasura
Mardini. She is called as Nava Chandi,

00:02:32.356 --> 00:02:36.526
the One who has killed nine Chandas,
means nine rakshasas She has killed.

00:02:36.727 --> 00:02:41.672
So is a very important day, and very vital,
and very deep.

00:02:41.873 --> 00:02:44.104
It’s very simple to say, “Mother, we have
fixed

00:02:44.305 --> 00:02:47.027
Your puja on such and such day.”

00:02:47.228 --> 00:02:52.159
Nobody thinks what Mother has to work
behind the whole thing, you see.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.234
You can’t fix My puja. It’s not proper.

00:02:55.435 --> 00:02:59.350
It is I who can tell you what time is
the best for you to do the puja.

00:02:59.551 --> 00:03:05.834
So it starts at two minutes past twelve.

00:03:06.035 --> 00:03:09.399
So now we can start it, and that’s why
do I delayed My bath.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.146
But that would be too late, so I started
My bath little early.

00:03:14.347 --> 00:03:21.052
[Marathi aside] Then only we can do it.

00:03:21.253 --> 00:03:22.938
So today is the day of the Goddess,

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:24.852
a very important day that you are here.

00:03:25.053 --> 00:03:28.127
Somehow we are having all the pujas
on 9 days,

00:03:28.328 --> 00:03:31.746
and that’s why I am wearing this special
type of a sari,

00:03:31.947 --> 00:03:36.950
which is to be used for Ashta Bhuja’s
Vahana,

00:03:37.151 --> 00:03:41.390
is a tiger as well as a lion.

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.814
Imagine where I’m staying, there is
a photograph of a tiger and a lion both,

00:03:47.015 --> 00:03:50.329
in that room. You can go and see
for yourself.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:58.146
Normally you never get these, but that is
there, is a beautiful photograph,

00:03:58.347 --> 00:04:03.517
enlarged, of a tiger and a lion.

00:04:03.718 --> 00:04:07.743
So in the morning the Surya was
very beautiful,

00:04:07.944 --> 00:04:12.490
I don’t know if you saw the morning sun.

00:04:12.675 --> 00:04:16.089
At least tomorrow try to see.

00:04:16.882 --> 00:04:20.627
It’s not important how long you sleep here,
what food you eat,

00:04:20.828 --> 00:04:22.972
whether you get it in time and all that.

00:04:23.173 --> 00:04:25.866
You should get rid of these habits.
It’s very important

00:04:26.067 --> 00:04:28.880
that these regularities and all these
mundane type of things,

00:04:29.081 --> 00:04:30.802
the bounding of timing and all that –

00:04:31.003 --> 00:04:33.464
you must get out of it space and time,
everything.

00:04:33.665 --> 00:04:35.645
And should not go on worrying about things,

00:04:35.846 --> 00:04:39.958
because you get so exhausted, without
doing any work you feel exhausted.

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:43.878
Because you are so fixed up, so fixed up

00:04:44.079 --> 00:04:46.179
that you can’t get out of these habits,
you see.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.711
While the Indians are not fixed up
like that,

00:04:48.912 --> 00:04:50.737
they know that Mother knows the best,

00:04:50.938 --> 00:04:53.919
She will come at the time when the puja
has to be done.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.594
So, one should try to understand that
if I am the One,

00:04:58.795 --> 00:05:00.541
then why should you worry?

00:05:00.742 --> 00:05:04.493
But I have one problem with the Western
mind,

00:05:04.694 --> 00:05:09.708
is that if they cannot conceive it, they’ll
start criticising.

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:13.855
Instead of making yourself subtler and
subtler to conceive

00:05:14.056 --> 00:05:15.656
the beauty of the Divine,

00:05:15.857 --> 00:05:19.003
if you don’t get it, you will start
criticising on any point,

00:05:19.204 --> 00:05:22.259
anything you can get hold of, and you’ll
start criticising.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.237
So that’s not the way we can grow.

00:05:24.438 --> 00:05:28.927
That’s why I’m telling you beforehand that
this puja is very important,

00:05:29.128 --> 00:05:31.527
and at this puja, you have to request

00:05:31.728 --> 00:05:35.160
that these nine Chandas, who are still
there, should be killed

00:05:35.361 --> 00:05:39.597
and this Mahishasura also should be killed,
they should be driven out.

00:05:39.798 --> 00:05:44.528
And that’s how it is going to work out
and it’s very important.

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:49.104
[It’s] very important, I have to work it
out Myself.

00:05:49.305 --> 00:05:52.485
[You] see, it’s not easy just to organise
a programme

00:05:52.686 --> 00:05:55.654
like a, preside over something, you just
come along -

00:05:55.855 --> 00:05:58.279
it is not that way. It’s much, much deeper,

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.991
it has much deeper significance,
much deeper work has to be done.

00:06:03.192 --> 00:06:06.412
So many things have to [be] worked out.
It’s a very subtle thing.

00:06:06.613 --> 00:06:09.422
And the more you discuss it, the more you
talk about it, you’ll lose it,

00:06:09.623 --> 00:06:12.772
you should keep quiet and absorb it.

00:06:12.973 --> 00:06:17.059
So today is not a day of such a mundane
type, is very important

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:21.924
in this small place, where we are sitting,
we are doing a tremendous job.

00:06:22.125 --> 00:06:25.806
And you people, who have suffered the most
on account of these rakshasas,

00:06:26.007 --> 00:06:32.789
should be absolutely intensively be careful
that these sinners must go out.

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.094
Something has to be done, instead
of thinking about yourself

00:06:36.295 --> 00:06:39.382
and your inconveniences, your troubles and
whatever you call them,

00:06:39.583 --> 00:06:43.210
which are not so important at all!

00:06:44.345 --> 00:06:49.362
You are saints and you must support
all divine work

00:06:49.559 --> 00:06:52.517
by complete understanding.

00:06:52.718 --> 00:06:55.649
On the contrary, if you are so much worried
about your own things,

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:59.352
I mean, you are of no use, to yourself
or to Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:59.553 --> 00:07:05.534
So I would say that even some people will
see that this happened, that happened.

00:07:05.735 --> 00:07:09.928
Perhaps the group is a bit too big
to accommodate in all these places.

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:13.670
I always had a feeling that the group
is increasing a bit too much.

00:07:13.871 --> 00:07:16.999
And we didn’t have any idea of so many
people coming in.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:22.066
But doesn’t matter – they are sharing, we
are settled down, there’s a place to sleep.

00:07:22.267 --> 00:07:26.637
And if you can understand this, [you] see,
that these things are not important,

00:07:26.838 --> 00:07:30.020
then you go to England and just sleep, or
you go to Australia and just sleep.

00:07:30.221 --> 00:07:32.348
I mean, you have all the time to do
all that.

00:07:32.549 --> 00:07:37.894
Just now you are here to become subtler
and subtler.

00:07:39.692 --> 00:07:45.290
Now the time has started and the Brahmin
also came at the right time

00:07:45.491 --> 00:07:52.109
So we have to be one with the subtleties.

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:55.290
Sahaja Yoga is not possible if you want
to see it

00:07:55.491 --> 00:07:58.727
from a gross level: you cannot understand
Sahaja Yoga [that way].

00:07:58.928 --> 00:08:01.171
I have already told you that without
realisation,

00:08:01.372 --> 00:08:03.463
you cannot have Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:03.664 --> 00:08:06.635
But even after realisation, if you stick
on to those old things

00:08:06.836 --> 00:08:11.129
which belongs to the egg time, you will
have no advantage.

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:17.032
So try to become subtler and subtler,
and don’t think about it.

00:08:17.233 --> 00:08:20.448
You will relax, you will feel better,
it will act.

00:08:20.649 --> 00:08:22.504
That you should have food at the right
time,

00:08:22.705 --> 00:08:25.996
you must have this at the right time,
this should be the food - this is, I mean,

00:08:26.197 --> 00:08:30.063
it’s such a stuck up thing, you know.

00:08:30.264 --> 00:08:33.065
We cannot be stuck up with food, we
cannot be stuck up with all these things.

00:08:33.266 --> 00:08:40.384
You are going to a level where nobody
has reached.

00:08:42.704 --> 00:08:47.207
With this understanding if you become
surrendered –

00:08:47.408 --> 00:08:49.901
means not to give Me anything,

00:08:50.102 --> 00:08:55.242
but to get rid of your ego and your stuck
up ideas which there have been –

00:08:55.443 --> 00:08:59.020
it would be a very good thing.

00:08:59.547 --> 00:09:03.630
When you discuss also among yourselves,
nobody should discuss inconveniences.

00:09:03.831 --> 00:09:07.799
I had told you that in a village it’s
a very difficult thing [indistinct words].

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.155
You don’t have to go to Himalayas,

00:09:09.356 --> 00:09:11.901
but travelling through India is not
an easy thing.

00:09:12.102 --> 00:09:15.672
And I had told all of you, I live with much
more conveniences

00:09:15.873 --> 00:09:21.599
and comforts than anyone of you live.
But I can adjust Myself much more,

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.047
so you should also try to forget about it.

00:09:24.248 --> 00:09:28.488
Don’t talk of your inconveniences. That
will make you very gross.

00:09:28.689 --> 00:09:36.031
The one who becomes subtler and subtler
can only achieve something.

00:09:37.396 --> 00:09:41.029
Today is another day, is called Bhishma
Ashtami,

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:44.650
is the day when Bhishma, who was a great
saint

00:09:44.851 --> 00:09:52.680
who took a great vow and that vow he
carried out all his life.

00:09:52.881 --> 00:09:57.290
It was a great vow he took. So today
also is the day of a vow.

00:09:57.491 --> 00:10:00.585
He took on an Ashtami day. On the Ashtami
day he took a vow,

00:10:00.786 --> 00:10:05.217
so today is another day for you to take
a vow.

00:10:05.418 --> 00:10:09.256
So also you should try to take a vow

00:10:09.457 --> 00:10:12.534
and with that vow, you should be able

00:10:12.735 --> 00:10:17.078
to achieve something which has not been
yet achieved.

00:10:24.868 --> 00:10:27.994
This achievement is not only for this
place,

00:10:28.182 --> 00:10:35.383
is not only for Maharashtra, it is not only
for India,

00:10:35.584 --> 00:10:40.666
it is not only for the whole world, but for
the whole Universe.

00:10:40.867 --> 00:10:46.819
So you are playing a very important,
vital role

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:52.982
and one should try to improve one’s
quality of life,

00:10:53.199 --> 00:10:55.484
quality of personality.

00:10:55.685 --> 00:11:01.343
Unless and until you have that substantial
quality, nothing is going to work out.

00:11:01.544 --> 00:11:05.920
This is what I am telling them: that you
must work out

00:11:06.121 --> 00:11:11.015
in such a way that you become substantially
dedicated to Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:11.216 --> 00:11:15.406
Not just for your sake, not just for your
family

00:11:15.567 --> 00:11:18.390
or for your country, but for the whole
Universe.

00:11:18.591 --> 00:11:30.286
So you are the seeds who are going
to create that great atmosphere

00:11:30.454 --> 00:11:41.834
that will bring forth the great change that
we are expecting of Mahayoga.

00:11:42.035 --> 00:11:49.702
It is very important to understand that
so many people have talked about this,

00:11:49.903 --> 00:11:53.491
and I have come across a book which was
written 2000 years back

00:11:53.692 --> 00:11:57.444
which describes about this Mahayoga,

00:11:57.645 --> 00:11:59.897
and what is going to happen. It is very
interesting.

00:12:00.098 --> 00:12:03.909
After the puja and havan, I think
Mr. Chauhan will translate it to you

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:09.015
and you can understand what it is about.
So let us start now.
