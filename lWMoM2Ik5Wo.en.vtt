06:54.998 --> 07:00.976
Today is the sixth day of Navaratri.

07:11.114 --> 07:15.607
There have been many incarnations
of the Goddess

07:15.632 --> 07:19.952
for different, different purposes.

07:24.203 --> 07:33.073
But when the great saints
introspect themselves,

07:33.098 --> 07:36.614
who were worshipping the Mother,

07:36.647 --> 07:47.037
they found out that what
She has done for us.

07:48.199 --> 07:51.639
The other day I told you
the dharma

07:51.664 --> 07:59.209
is the innate valency of human beings.
And they are ten.

07:59.234 --> 08:06.088
This is already established within us,
but we deviate,

08:06.113 --> 08:11.112
deviate from dharma and all
the problems come in,

08:11.137 --> 08:18.448
because to leave the dharma
is not a human quality.

08:20.064 --> 08:27.489
But Goddess Herself has done so many
things for us already, within us,

08:27.514 --> 08:31.238
though we are not aware of it.

08:31.847 --> 08:37.131
It is said that “ya Devi sarva
bhuteshu” -

08:37.156 --> 08:42.314
"all those whom You have created",
- means mostly the human beings -

08:42.339 --> 08:49.762
"What do You do? As what do You exist
inside the human beings? ”.

08:52.161 --> 08:58.651
Now, just introspect if you have
these qualities within you or not,

08:58.692 --> 09:08.215
because they are given to you by
the Goddess, by the Shakti within you.

09:10.945 --> 09:18.501
Like: ”Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
shanti rupena samstitha”.

09:18.526 --> 09:26.315
is very important, that You exist
within the human beings as peace.

09:26.340 --> 09:33.153
Do you find thus human beings
who are peaceful within and without?

09:33.178 --> 09:38.024
Very difficult. But She has given
you that,

09:38.049 --> 09:42.801
She has given you that peace
which you have to achieve.

09:42.826 --> 09:50.096
Now it comes, because you have fallen
off your human dharmas.

09:50.121 --> 09:54.445
So this peace that She has given you,
you have to achieve

09:54.470 --> 10:00.401
through your ascent, through
the Kundalini awakening.

10:00.426 --> 10:10.469
You are excited, all right.
Or, you want to take revenge,

10:10.494 --> 10:17.618
you want to hurt others,
you want to trouble others;

10:17.643 --> 10:21.895
you enjoy sometimes,
even as sahaja yogis

10:21.920 --> 10:28.562
people enjoy hurting others,
troubling others.

10:28.587 --> 10:32.572
So, the second one She says is:

10:32.597 --> 10:39.584
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
pritti rupena samsthita”.

10:39.609 --> 10:43.998
Pritti  is the quality of loving,

10:44.023 --> 10:51.868
that a human being has been given
the quality of loving.

10:51.893 --> 10:55.098
But, it’s not there.

10:55.123 --> 11:02.154
Because first nonsensical thing
human beings have is jealousy.

11:04.162 --> 11:08.925
Now, supposing I give some present
to somebody,

11:08.950 --> 11:11.576
and some present to another one.

11:11.601 --> 11:17.288
Even in Sahaja Yoga they feel
jealous. Very surprising.

11:17.313 --> 11:23.173
How can you, when the Goddess
has given you the quality to love?

11:23.198 --> 11:32.015
Very, very common nonsense about it
is that human beings are very jealous.

11:32.040 --> 11:35.775
But as sahaja yogis you should
not do,

11:35.800 --> 11:41.109
because that quality that the Goddess
has given you is of loving.

11:41.134 --> 11:45.092
That quality should be shown -
on the contrary you are very jealous.

11:45.117 --> 11:50.669
That means you are not a sahaja yogi,
blessed by Shri Mataji - no.

11:50.694 --> 11:55.330
If you are blessed, then you will have
no jealousy whatsoever.

11:55.355 --> 12:00.379
And this jealousy sometimes it goes
to this extent that

12:00.404 --> 12:09.678
"Now, we are, say, from Cabella,
so you are from Albera. Finished!"

12:09.703 --> 12:14.260
These so close to each other.

12:14.285 --> 12:22.011
Just like the two nostrils together.
But there will be jealousy.

12:22.036 --> 12:26.481
There will be jealousy about,
”Why not Mother come to my country,

12:26.506 --> 12:30.350
if You can go to that country”.

12:30.375 --> 12:33.670
So this comes also from the ignorance
that

12:33.695 --> 12:39.600
“This is mine, this is mine,
this is yours”.

12:40.465 --> 12:49.762
This jealousy starts in such a funny
manner that we do not realize also

12:49.787 --> 12:58.757
that She has given us the power to love.
Tremendous power to love.

13:00.563 --> 13:04.917
Inauspicious power, our cannot be.

13:04.942 --> 13:10.437
But auspicious, dharmic power
to love somebody.

13:10.462 --> 13:18.017
Means without any lust and greed,
without any jealousy.

13:18.042 --> 13:22.546
But the human mind has developed
itself so cunning

13:22.571 --> 13:27.723
that it is proud that it can be
jealous of someone.

13:27.748 --> 13:33.066
Out of this jealousy only greed
comes in, as I told you.

13:33.091 --> 13:38.817
Is a fact, because you feel jealous
- so you want to buy the same thing.

13:38.842 --> 13:41.984
Then you must compete with others.

13:42.009 --> 13:48.455
If somebody has got a job better than
yours, then you must compete with him.

13:50.209 --> 13:56.659
These things are all destructive and
the powers of Goddess are constructive.

13:56.684 --> 14:05.113
She gives you all the powers
that are absolutely constructive.

14:05.138 --> 14:10.939
Then She says, “Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu”,
the saints have said it,

14:10.964 --> 14:14.446
- "kshama rupena samsthita”.

14:14.471 --> 14:21.005
Kshama is what you call
is the forgiveness.

14:21.030 --> 14:24.861
Forgiveness from the heart.

14:24.886 --> 14:30.225
All right, somebody has been cruel
to you, has been nasty to you,

14:30.250 --> 14:33.207
has exploited you, has troubled you,

14:33.232 --> 14:39.084
but you have the power, greater power
to forgive.

14:39.109 --> 14:44.737
Do we use that power to forgive?

14:48.605 --> 14:56.169
Then for relaxing also, what does
She do, that She gives you the sleep.

14:56.194 --> 15:01.385
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
nidra rupena samsthita”.

15:01.410 --> 15:06.385
When you are tired and you
can’t sleep

15:06.410 --> 15:12.827
She makes you sleep. She relaxes you.
So the power of relaxation She does

15:12.852 --> 15:17.037
because She acts through parasympathetic
nervous system.

15:17.062 --> 15:21.912
The sympathetic nervous system
can excite you, can depress you.

15:21.937 --> 15:27.858
But the parasympathetic relaxes you,
relaxes your heart,

15:27.883 --> 15:31.905
relaxes your body and completely
feel relaxed

15:31.930 --> 15:35.931
and sleeping in the lap of your Mother.

15:35.956 --> 15:40.409
But there are many people
who cannot sleep.

15:41.075 --> 15:48.422
Because they are thinking about
something they have to achieve.

15:48.447 --> 15:53.699
If you cannot sleep, then something
wrong with you.

15:53.724 --> 15:57.803
And when you cannot sleep
I also cannot sleep.

15:57.828 --> 16:04.757
Whatever collectively happening
also works on Me.

16:04.782 --> 16:11.436
Anything wrong you do, that works
on Me, specially collectively.

16:11.460 --> 16:19.149
So you cannot sleep because you are
thinking of things which are of no value.

16:19.174 --> 16:21.539
Now, to overcome that in Sahaja Yoga

16:21.564 --> 16:25.020
we know we have to go into
thoughtless awareness.

16:25.045 --> 16:29.321
But when your ego is working or...

16:29.346 --> 16:33.885
This child is very disturbing. I've seen
him all the time running about.

16:33.910 --> 16:39.174
Better tell him. Whose son is he?

16:43.332 --> 16:48.418
You see, in India you’ll find children
absolutely keeping quiet.

16:48.443 --> 16:56.196
Why? Because the mother takes up
the responsibility to train the child.

16:56.221 --> 16:59.971
So many programs you have had,
have you ever seen

16:59.996 --> 17:03.684
any child running about? Yesterday also
they were running about here.

17:03.709 --> 17:09.526
The reason is mother doesn’t take
responsibility as a mother

17:09.551 --> 17:14.027
to see that the children are properly
brought up.

17:14.052 --> 17:18.327
Even you are so old, but I have
to tell you.

17:18.352 --> 17:24.196
Whatever is good for you, for your
society, a new generation that has come.

17:24.221 --> 17:30.090
In this new generation if you still
are not behaving in a proper way,

17:30.115 --> 17:34.213
in abnormal way, how can you
impress others?

17:34.238 --> 17:37.785
So, Mother has to tell you.

17:42.972 --> 17:51.894
The most interesting thing that
the Mother has put in you is

17:51.919 --> 17:58.282
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
bhranti rupena samsthita”.

17:58.307 --> 18:02.102
She puts you into delusion,

18:02.127 --> 18:06.844
because sometimes the children
cannot understand

18:06.869 --> 18:13.225
unless and until they face the delusion.
They have to face the delusion.

18:13.250 --> 18:18.853
She allows, allows you to go wrong

18:18.878 --> 18:23.574
to a point where you discover
you are lost.

18:23.599 --> 18:26.835
Very important it is that She plays,

18:26.860 --> 18:30.587
this is the Mahamaya part
as they say.

18:30.612 --> 18:34.778
And this is discussed
in every religion

18:34.803 --> 18:39.647
that we get lost with this delusion.

18:39.672 --> 18:44.251
Now, what are the delusions
we have?

18:44.276 --> 18:48.181
We have the delusions
of ego.

18:48.206 --> 18:53.459
Ego for men as if they are
very powerful,

18:53.484 --> 19:00.034
that they can do what they like and they
are not going to be punished for it.

19:00.059 --> 19:04.449
For women they too behave
in the same manner.

19:04.474 --> 19:09.315
They don’t understand that
this is a delusion

19:09.340 --> 19:17.833
the Mother has given into us for us
to find out that we are in the wrong.

19:17.858 --> 19:22.980
Because if you tell somebody,
“This is wrong, you don’t do it”,

19:23.005 --> 19:28.066
still they are not matured enough
so they’ll go on doing wrong things.

19:28.091 --> 19:33.330
So the Mother says, “All right, go on.
Very nice, very good. Very good thing.

19:33.355 --> 19:37.722
You’ll jump in the sea? – Jump”.

19:38.212 --> 19:44.797
Then when you realize that you
have been in a delusion,

19:44.822 --> 19:47.885
then only you can return back.

19:47.910 --> 19:52.219
Otherwise without any problem
you cannot return.

19:52.244 --> 20:03.503
So many of you are so obstinate,
so self-conscious.

20:03.528 --> 20:08.268
Whatever one may tell you,
you will not listen.

20:08.293 --> 20:14.854
Whatever way you may try to convince,
on a mental level, you won’t.

20:14.879 --> 20:20.889
So, the bhranti, the delusion,
is beyond the mind.

20:20.914 --> 20:24.212
It is beyond the mind.

20:24.237 --> 20:31.245
It works out sometimes very well
for difficult people.

20:31.621 --> 20:38.897
Now, when you are in a position
of a Mother

20:38.922 --> 20:45.851
you don’t want Your child to be ruined, naturally.

20:45.876 --> 20:50.324
She feels responsible,
and She thinks that:

20:50.349 --> 20:54.382
“Now they have got connection
with the Divine,

20:54.407 --> 20:57.851
and this connection should not
be broken,

20:57.876 --> 21:02.964
that they should be all the time
blessed and be happy.

21:02.989 --> 21:06.640
All this is within us,

21:07.278 --> 21:12.986
within us, built-in, from our
very childhood,

21:13.011 --> 21:19.872
but we forget, slowly, slowly
we start losing it.

21:19.897 --> 21:24.965
Maybe the conditioning is such
or maybe the ego is such,

21:24.990 --> 21:32.698
and maybe that they forget that
they are realized souls.

21:32.723 --> 21:38.618
I’m talking to you - to people who are
realized souls. I’m not talking

21:38.643 --> 21:45.306
to people who are already lost or who
may be on their way to Sahaja Yoga.

21:45.331 --> 21:49.768
But the way you are brought up,
the way you have been told

21:49.793 --> 21:57.526
very sweetly with love, with affection,
with kindness,

21:57.551 --> 22:03.051
and if you don’t understand that,
then you go into bhranti.

22:03.076 --> 22:05.185
For example, it is also said that,

22:05.210 --> 22:12.122
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
lajja rupena samsthita”.

22:12.939 --> 22:18.558
Lajja, I don’t know how to describe,
it’s not shyness.

22:18.583 --> 22:27.634
It is a kind of a shame about
your body.

22:28.898 --> 22:35.598
Now they have beauty contests. India
also they had beauty contest.

22:35.623 --> 22:40.201
Why are you writing?
What is he writing?

22:40.226 --> 22:45.393
There’s no need to write, there will be
a tape. Alright?

22:46.444 --> 22:49.610
Lajja rupena samsthita:

22:49.635 --> 22:55.802
means you have to have shame
of your body.

22:56.691 --> 23:00.469
That’s specially for women.

23:00.494 --> 23:09.125
As a child you will see, women are
very shy.

23:09.150 --> 23:12.206
See, little girls, they are
very shy.

23:12.231 --> 23:15.169
That shyness gradually disappears,

23:15.194 --> 23:18.669
but in the beginning they are
even shy of Me.

23:18.694 --> 23:23.129
They come before Me, they’ll put down
their head.

23:23.154 --> 23:28.280
They’ll not even say Namaste.
Very sweet.

23:28.889 --> 23:32.259
And they don’t like people wearing
funny dresses.

23:32.284 --> 23:37.498
I remember My granddaughter once,
she saw one magazine

23:37.523 --> 23:42.379
in which there was a lady in a swimming
dress. She said, “What are you doing?

23:42.404 --> 23:47.475
Better wear your dress, otherwise
my Grandma will come and hit you hard”.

23:47.500 --> 23:52.509
To that lady was saying that; and then
she opened and saw a man’s dress

23:52.534 --> 23:57.415
with just a small, little knicker.
I don’t know why they do it.

23:57.440 --> 24:01.515
And then she said, “This one is, seems
to be absolutely shameless fellow.

24:01.540 --> 24:04.849
He is going to have a bad time now.”
And she closed it.

24:04.874 --> 24:08.533
And then she told the maidservant,
“Burn this, burn this off.

24:08.558 --> 24:15.418
I don’t want to see.” Such a little
girl she knew that it was wrong.

24:15.443 --> 24:22.595
But the way nowadays we are going
about with the show of our body,

24:22.620 --> 24:31.325
and sometimes I feel that all these
designers will die

24:31.350 --> 24:38.745
or will get bankrupt, because people
wear such little clothes these days.

24:38.770 --> 24:43.562
There is no space for any artist

24:43.587 --> 24:53.214
to show his work or to show his art
how he can dress you up.

24:53.239 --> 25:00.279
In Japan I asked them how - this is long
time back, now Japanese are Americans

25:00.304 --> 25:04.488
but at that time - I said, “How is it
you wear these dresses, these kimonos,

25:04.513 --> 25:12.156
done so well, very expensive and
it takes time to wear that?”.

25:12.591 --> 25:17.804
So they said that, “You see, if God
has made a beautiful body,

25:17.829 --> 25:21.455
then it is His art,

25:21.480 --> 25:29.145
and we have to make our art
decorate it.

25:29.170 --> 25:34.122
So what we do is to make our art
to decorate it.”

25:34.147 --> 25:38.381
I really liked it, because in India
same thing.

25:38.406 --> 25:41.990
If there is a lady she has
to wear a sari,

25:42.015 --> 25:45.684
which is being made very artfully,
very beautifully,

25:45.709 --> 25:51.935
just to decorate her body,
just to respect the body.

25:52.451 --> 25:58.233
But this seems to have gone
with the influence of America,

25:58.258 --> 26:02.331
I should say, which are, they are
brainless people, absolutely brainless,

26:02.356 --> 26:07.548
nothing to learn from them.
Only two-hundred-year-old people

26:07.573 --> 26:11.240
and we start behaving in their
manner,

26:11.265 --> 26:14.291
we don’t see even what is happening
to their country,

26:14.316 --> 26:19.674
what sort of people they are,
how they live, what is their idea,

26:19.699 --> 26:24.269
what is their goal in life. Every false
guru has exploited them,

26:24.294 --> 26:28.421
because they are brainless.
If they had brains

26:28.446 --> 26:31.210
they would never have accepted
them.

26:31.235 --> 26:34.292
Ha, they have brains how to run
a computer

26:34.317 --> 26:37.662
and how to run a television -
mechanical things.

26:37.687 --> 26:43.255
But as far as their own body is concerned,
they don’t know how to manage.

26:43.280 --> 26:50.066
In India they had a beauty competition
and many sensible people opposed it,

26:50.091 --> 26:54.957
because it’s like selling your body
and making money.

26:54.982 --> 26:59.405
What is the difference between
prostitution and this?

26:59.430 --> 27:05.977
If you get money by selling your body,
then it’s prostitution.

27:06.002 --> 27:09.631
You are not supposed to sell
your body.

27:09.656 --> 27:14.773
That’s not what Goddess has done
to you.

27:14.798 --> 27:20.025
But you should dress up well, different,
different occasions are there,

27:20.050 --> 27:23.939
for those occasions you have to wear
the way it is.

27:23.964 --> 27:28.024
The other day I gave a very nice
sari which is,

27:28.049 --> 27:31.500
we call as paithani to one lady
as a present.

27:31.525 --> 27:39.566
And we had a function for a book,
was inaugurated,

27:39.591 --> 27:43.478
and this lady came there. So I said,
“Why didn’t you wear a paithani?”

27:43.503 --> 27:47.576
She said, “What, there is
no wedding on.

27:47.601 --> 27:54.131
How can I wear for this function
paithani? There has to be a wedding.”

27:54.157 --> 27:59.560
Very sweet – “in the wedding
I can wear.”

27:59.585 --> 28:07.280
It is all, you see occasions, places
which are to be celebrated.

28:07.305 --> 28:10.483
Like in India, when women go
to the temple

28:10.508 --> 28:14.087
or to worship the idols or anything,

28:14.112 --> 28:22.542
then they will wear all that is necessary
to face the Goddess, after all.

28:22.567 --> 28:28.252
Imagine people coming for this program
here wearing,

28:28.277 --> 28:35.488
I don’t know what they call it, but like
jute, jute clothes - like hippies,

28:35.513 --> 28:39.655
what would happen to Me? I would disappear
in thin air, I can tell you this much.

28:39.680 --> 28:42.690
So, one has to have respect
for the body.

28:42.715 --> 28:49.476
That is what She has said first -
that “Lajja rupena samsthita”.

28:49.501 --> 28:55.469
Now you might say that there are people
who are taking the bath in the river

28:55.494 --> 28:59.870
and this and that, and give
justification.

28:59.895 --> 29:04.453
But you are saints! You are
realized souls!

29:04.478 --> 29:07.678
You don’t have to see those people
who are not yet realized

29:07.703 --> 29:11.131
and who are misbehaving.

29:11.156 --> 29:16.965
You must do what a saint should do.

29:17.419 --> 29:21.616
There are so many qualities that
the Goddess has given you.

29:21.641 --> 29:26.502
Another is kshudha rupena
samstitha.

29:26.527 --> 29:32.933
She’s the One who has given us hunger.
We have to eat our food.

29:32.958 --> 29:37.050
Nowadays there’s a fashion of becoming
thin or whatever you may call.

29:37.075 --> 29:40.693
And you know so many diseases
have developed.

29:40.718 --> 29:46.013
Anorexia, this thing, that thing,
because women want to eat little.

29:46.038 --> 29:50.474
You can change the things
that you are eating,

29:50.499 --> 29:56.099
but it’s not the aim of life to only
look after your body.

29:56.124 --> 30:03.709
Body is not the only important thing.
What is important is your Spirit.

30:04.104 --> 30:08.830
And She is the One who gives you
the Kundalini.

30:08.855 --> 30:13.723
She is the One who give you a method
by which you’ll ascend.

30:13.748 --> 30:18.088
But all the time worried about
their body.

30:18.113 --> 30:24.764
This is something I can’t understand.
Specially the women who are the shakti.

30:24.789 --> 30:33.194
Then another point is that they
follow a fashion.

30:34.056 --> 30:38.131
Fashion is madness.

30:39.346 --> 30:45.673
When I was young I used to wear
My blouses like this only.

30:45.698 --> 30:48.401
But in India also fashion started.

30:48.426 --> 30:52.869
They used to increase the size
of the sleeves,

30:52.895 --> 30:59.500
then decreased the size of the sleeves,
then some went up to here.

30:59.525 --> 31:03.778
I thought, “What is this nonsense?
Why waste money like this?”.

31:03.803 --> 31:06.008
You have a particular design,

31:06.033 --> 31:10.015
and this is traditionally accepted
design, that you should have.

31:10.040 --> 31:13.712
Why do you want to go on increasing
and decreasing

31:13.737 --> 31:18.681
the size of your sleeves, according
to the fashion. “This is the fashion”.

31:18.706 --> 31:25.030
Who makes the fashion? Devi?
Devi has made the fashion?

31:25.055 --> 31:32.002
Who has made the fashion? Is these
hungry, greedy people

31:32.043 --> 31:37.027
who are befooling you. And you are
trying to follow fashions.

31:37.052 --> 31:41.541
Now, for example, I told that you must
put oil in your head,

31:41.566 --> 31:46.633
at least on Saturday put sufficient oil
and then wash your head.

31:46.658 --> 31:51.784
But you’ll not do that and then
you’ll start losing your hair.

31:51.809 --> 31:57.078
I can understand if you have no time,
you are a very busy man - but why?

31:57.103 --> 32:03.727
Why not do something where it is
needed to look after yourself also.

32:03.752 --> 32:07.399
So, you’ll look after your body
to thin down, you’ll lose your hair,

32:07.424 --> 32:10.257
eyesight will be weak, your teeth
will be falling,

32:10.305 --> 32:16.088
and you will become very soon
an old hag.

32:16.704 --> 32:22.718
Same with the men, nowadays men are
also going to beauty parlor, I’m told.

32:22.742 --> 32:26.099
Too much money I think, and stupidity
together.

32:26.124 --> 32:31.717
There is no need. If you lead
a good, healthy life

32:31.742 --> 32:35.598
- you have to exercise and meditate.

32:35.623 --> 32:40.171
If you meditate you become peaceful.

32:40.196 --> 32:45.675
With that peace, you’ll be amazed,
you’ll have so much of energy.

32:45.708 --> 32:54.083
So much energy is wasted in thinking.
And what do you think?

32:54.108 --> 32:57.496
If you ask somebody: “What are you
thinking?”

32:57.521 --> 33:02.105
“Everything.” But “everything”
means what?

33:02.130 --> 33:07.958
Why do you think so much?
What is the need to think?

33:07.983 --> 33:14.988
It’s a habit, human habit to go on
thinking about everything.

33:15.013 --> 33:20.290
For example, just now, there are
three carpets here.

33:20.315 --> 33:27.927
Now, if I put attention on it I’ll just
see how nice they are; I’ll just enjoy

33:27.952 --> 33:32.681
- enjoy what the artists have done,
that’s all.

33:32.706 --> 33:37.467
No words - nothing. Just the enjoyment
within yourself.

33:37.492 --> 33:41.035
But if you ask somebody else,
he’ll just start saying,

33:41.060 --> 33:43.787
“Oh, this is not good.
That’s not good.

33:43.812 --> 33:48.214
This much some price, that price,
this thing, that thing.”

33:48.239 --> 33:52.110
The joy of that artist is finished.

33:52.135 --> 33:58.131
You cannot get that joy,

33:59.488 --> 34:07.214
that joy about which we are seeking.
What we are seeking is joy,

34:07.239 --> 34:12.450
and even when you have got a way
of doing it you do not achieve it.

34:12.475 --> 34:18.328
Because thinking is a reaction,
reaction to everything,

34:18.353 --> 34:21.600
and it makes the life so miserable.

34:21.625 --> 34:26.323
It makes the life of the person who
thinks and of others also.

34:26.348 --> 34:32.136
I’ll give you an example. This whole
thing we got it done

34:32.161 --> 34:37.384
just because it’s very heavy rains
and also we have

34:37.409 --> 34:41.260
problems of sometimes snowing.

34:41.292 --> 34:44.536
So I thought that’s a nice thing
to have a nice thing done

34:44.561 --> 34:47.962
and it’s very well done, we got it.

34:47.987 --> 34:53.902
Now, there are thinking people
in this Italy. Lots of them.

34:53.927 --> 35:00.563
That’s why it’s not progressing.
Now, we applied three years back.

35:00.588 --> 35:05.846
Three years they kept our money
locked up in the bank, imagine.

35:05.871 --> 35:10.432
And first time they said, “All right,
everything is fine, it’s all right.

35:10.457 --> 35:16.706
You can have it.” It had seventy
signatures

35:16.731 --> 35:20.407
of these Italians, so-called.

35:20.432 --> 35:24.878
And then they came round to say,
the same people,

35:24.903 --> 35:29.517
“No, no, no, you must change it
to copper”. I said, “Why?”

35:29.542 --> 35:34.310
“Because copper will be aesthetically
very good.”

35:34.335 --> 35:38.822
But don’t they know, stupid people,
that copper will look the same

35:38.847 --> 35:45.914
as they are looking? After one month
only they will have the same colour?

35:46.535 --> 35:49.730
This is the idea of aesthetics,
and now I have told them,

35:49.755 --> 35:55.140
“We don’t want your land, you keep it
to yourself, give us back our money.”

35:55.165 --> 35:58.772
With a simple thing like that.

35:58.797 --> 36:05.731
Why? Because they have a committee,
there is “rejune, bijune, sijune”.

36:05.756 --> 36:08.942
You have to go through all that
nonsense,

36:08.967 --> 36:11.848
because they all sit down on chairs,
very seriously,

36:11.873 --> 36:15.173
“We must discuss, we must consult,
we must ask everyone,

36:15.198 --> 36:20.249
and then this and that”. And ultimately
what comes?

36:20.274 --> 36:25.150
No progress of any kind. There is
no peace.

36:25.175 --> 36:29.688
Maybe, I don’t know, maybe some
underhand dealings are needed,

36:29.713 --> 36:35.000
for which they are feeling shy to tell
Me. I don’t know what is the thing is,

36:35.025 --> 36:40.851
but still I can’t understand when
the one office says “Yes”

36:40.876 --> 36:48.572
and again, when it comes back to it,
it says “No”. Three years.

36:48.597 --> 36:56.485
So, what I am trying to say that
thinking too much is a sign of ego.

36:56.510 --> 37:01.839
But, they don’t find any solutions,
no solutions of any kind.

37:01.864 --> 37:08.148
They’ll never hit the solution. Because
they are just discussing,

37:08.173 --> 37:15.020
arguing, thinking - they have
no solutions.

37:21.271 --> 37:31.256
Now, it is important that sahaja yogis
have to do introspection,

37:31.281 --> 37:38.986
introspection - inward. Introspection
is inward-looking.

37:39.011 --> 37:42.951
Inward-looking. “Why I am thinking?
What am I thinking?

37:42.976 --> 37:46.555
What is the need to think?”.

37:47.306 --> 37:53.913
You will become Nirvichara. Don’t allow
your mind to befool you.

37:53.938 --> 37:58.161
This mind is like a monkey, I tell you,
it’s really like a monkey.

37:58.186 --> 38:02.110
And when it starts working it makes you
jump from this end to that end,

38:02.135 --> 38:07.469
that end to that end. And if you reach
some conclusions, so-called,

38:07.494 --> 38:13.509
and if it is not achieved then you are
the most miserable person.

38:13.534 --> 38:22.988
I have seen people thinning down only
thinking about something which is absurd.

38:23.013 --> 38:25.841
And you can see out of this thinking
what comes out

38:25.866 --> 38:32.488
on a global level also. What is
the need to go to the moon?

38:32.513 --> 38:36.173
So many people are starved,
are dying out.

38:36.198 --> 38:40.679
What is the need to go to Mars?

38:40.704 --> 38:45.146
What are they going to get from there?
Because they formed a habit.

38:45.171 --> 38:47.865
First they came to India, then went
to China,

38:47.890 --> 38:54.110
then went to this, then went to that;
they can’t sit down, settle down.

38:54.135 --> 38:58.257
They can’t settle down in the house
also.

38:58.282 --> 39:02.841
Specially men. If you are travelling
by train,

39:02.866 --> 39:07.889
even if the train stops for two minutes
men must get out.

39:07.922 --> 39:11.756
The wife will be worried now. And while
the train will be moving

39:11.781 --> 39:15.165
then they’ll jump in.

39:15.190 --> 39:20.426
It’s a cracked brain, I think, like a -
even why say they are like a monkey?

39:20.451 --> 39:24.495
Because monkeys won’t do that.

39:24.520 --> 39:31.510
It’s that they cannot stationary
remain in one place.

39:31.535 --> 39:36.726
Now, in meditation you have
to sit down, in one place,

39:36.751 --> 39:42.006
not to jump from here to there,
there to there. This is very difficult.

39:42.031 --> 39:46.988
Women have other problems.
While cooking they’ll meditate.

39:47.013 --> 39:49.292
They have no time!

39:49.317 --> 39:53.557
They have their friends, they have
to go to shopping,

39:53.582 --> 39:58.732
to buy things and fill the house
with all kinds of rubbish.

39:58.757 --> 40:02.891
They have no time for anything.
They are also very adventurous.

40:02.916 --> 40:06.382
They want to do business, they want
to do this, they want to do that.

40:06.407 --> 40:09.829
For meditation they have no time.

40:09.854 --> 40:17.812
So, settling down is very important.
Settle down with yourself.

40:18.232 --> 40:25.343
So, once someone told Me, “Mother, if
we settle down, we’ll become very fat.”

40:26.816 --> 40:32.552
All right, doesn’t matter -
but you settle down.

40:33.563 --> 40:39.368
All sorts of excuses are there
not to meditate.

40:39.393 --> 40:46.524
“Yes, I meditate, Mother, but you know,
so difficult in these modern times.

40:47.199 --> 40:51.628
There are crises in our lives,
there are problems in our lives.”

40:51.653 --> 40:56.067
But actually you’ll be amazed, when
there’s a crisis, say, in My family

40:56.092 --> 41:00.361
or in Sahaja Yoga, immediately
I become thoughtless.

41:00.386 --> 41:02.630
Spontaneously I become thoughtless,

41:02.655 --> 41:08.613
because the problem will be solved
by the Paramchaitanya.

41:08.638 --> 41:12.781
The Paramchaitanya is going to solve
the problem, why should I think?

41:12.806 --> 41:15.930
Forget it. Let the Paramchaitanya
look after.

41:15.955 --> 41:18.944
If you don’t depend on your
Paramchaitanya,

41:18.969 --> 41:22.934
it doesn’t help you. Doesn’t give you
any solutions.

41:22.959 --> 41:30.990
Then you go on round and round and round
with your brain and work it out.

41:31.494 --> 41:37.006
This is what you have to know definitely
that you are connected

41:37.031 --> 41:41.621
to the all-pervading Power
of Divine love.

41:41.646 --> 41:47.567
This is not love which is stupid -
love that thinks.

41:47.592 --> 41:53.281
Love that is truth. Love that is
joy.

41:53.306 --> 42:01.098
All this is built in within you, and now
you have got realization,

42:01.123 --> 42:10.441
so instead of evolving yourself, you just
jump into things which are of no value.

42:10.974 --> 42:18.123
And so many Sahaja Yogis get lost.
I was recently told by someone

42:18.148 --> 42:20.632
that we have lost about hundred
sahaja yogis,

42:20.657 --> 42:27.451
because they started following another
sahaja yogi, who started seeing things.

42:27.975 --> 42:31.567
So they also wanted to see.

42:31.592 --> 42:40.176
If you can see something that means
you are not there, simple thing.

42:42.050 --> 42:48.103
If I am, say, on the top of a mountain,
then I’m there.

42:48.128 --> 42:51.724
But if I am away from the mountain
I can see it.

42:51.749 --> 42:57.433
The more you see something that means
you are away from it.

42:57.458 --> 42:59.956
Did you follow this point?

42:59.981 --> 43:07.836
So, the subtle, the sukshma,
state is that

43:07.861 --> 43:13.276
where you are yourself that.

43:13.724 --> 43:18.272
So, how can you see yourself?

43:18.297 --> 43:22.526
This is the point Sahaja Yogis must
understand. Anybody who can –

43:22.551 --> 43:26.451
“Mother, oh no he can see, he saw
auras around You,

43:26.476 --> 43:32.663
he can see this thing.” So,
how can you see?

43:32.688 --> 43:37.879
Because you are that, you can’t see.
So, all such people

43:37.904 --> 43:42.073
who are very popular sometimes,
in the beginning of Sahaja Yoga

43:42.098 --> 43:50.108
try to control you and befool you.
And then you are thrown out.

43:50.388 --> 43:55.744
Now, this is what we call is
the judgement.

43:55.769 --> 44:02.827
There are sieves and sieves and sieves
through which you have to pass.

44:03.193 --> 44:09.623
Where you get enamoured by this or that, or you fall for this or that,

44:09.648 --> 44:17.819
all these things are there in a step-
by-step how you are arriving.

44:19.169 --> 44:26.977
You are arriving at that point where
your destruction is sure.

44:27.002 --> 44:34.306
Because you have to become the Spirit.
You have to rise in spiritual life.

44:34.331 --> 44:40.161
And if your movement is downward,
who can help you?

44:40.186 --> 44:47.216
This is a very interesting time as I told
you, is the time of judgement.

44:47.241 --> 44:53.596
And at this time we have to be careful
that we are our own judges.

44:53.621 --> 44:58.419
Nobody has to tell you that you are
catching this one and catching that one.

44:58.444 --> 45:04.481
You yourself can feel it what chakras
you are catching.

45:04.506 --> 45:08.596
Whatever I may try on My own

45:08.621 --> 45:13.235
to suck in all your problems,
do whatever is possible,

45:13.260 --> 45:20.761
to keep you rising and rising and rising,
but what I feel

45:20.786 --> 45:33.166
that this method of helping you
will not make you so strong,

45:33.191 --> 45:37.264
because you’ll always think that,
“After all, Mother will suck my problem.”

45:37.289 --> 45:42.178
If I get hundred letters, out of them
ninety-nine are of sahaja yogis

45:42.203 --> 45:48.636
who are suffering from this trouble
or that trouble. I’m amazed,

45:48.661 --> 45:56.702
you have all these qualities already
awakened in you, they are in you.

45:58.145 --> 46:01.017
You use them.

46:02.432 --> 46:05.020
Somebody will say, “That fellow
is troubling me,

46:05.045 --> 46:11.071
that wife is troubling me, the husband
troubling me.” Just forgive!

46:11.096 --> 46:18.009
Just forgive! Your power of forgiveness
is poor.

46:18.034 --> 46:22.194
Moreover, more than what the saints
have written

46:22.219 --> 46:31.713
you have got the power of truth.
You know the reality.

46:32.018 --> 46:38.583
Much more than those saints who
have praised the Goddess.

46:39.147 --> 46:43.285
If you could just think as to what
level you are sitting

46:43.310 --> 46:50.670
you wouldn’t fall, you wouldn’t go
down that much.

46:50.695 --> 46:56.636
Only problem is you have to know that
your ascent has to be spiritual,

46:56.661 --> 47:04.139
and already these qualities are very
well balanced and put within you.

47:04.164 --> 47:10.105
More than dharma. Dharma maybe,
you have a power

47:10.130 --> 47:18.978
to give up or to fall down, but these
powers are never destroyed within you.

47:19.227 --> 47:27.283
I remember once I went to America
first time and I met one gentleman.

47:27.308 --> 47:29.950
The next day he came and he told Me,
“Mother, I am changed,

47:29.975 --> 47:33.556
I am changed, I am changed.”
“What happened?”

47:33.581 --> 47:38.925
“You know, I used to hate my uncle,
I never wanted to talk to him,

47:38.950 --> 47:44.670
very angry with him, but this time,
just imagine,

47:44.695 --> 47:49.944
yesterday I met him, I went and hugged
him, and kissed him, and I said,

47:49.969 --> 47:52.699
‘Now, I have forgiven you,
completely forgiven you,

47:52.724 --> 47:57.088
now don’t think about feeling guilty
about it.

47:57.113 --> 48:01.680
He started looking at me
like this.’”

48:02.328 --> 48:04.473
So, with the Kundalini awakening

48:04.498 --> 48:10.187
all these beautiful qualities you have
will come up.

48:10.212 --> 48:15.679
And then your generosity,

48:17.326 --> 48:23.848
your beautiful being, which is
enlightened by the Spirit

48:23.873 --> 48:30.722
will prove to the world that Sahaja
Yoga is the truth.

48:32.205 --> 48:40.489
Yesterday’s beautiful dramas
have shown us,

48:40.514 --> 48:45.621
but it should not be a mental
satisfaction within you,

48:45.646 --> 48:48.068
that “I have got the realization,
now I am this”.

48:48.093 --> 48:55.812
No. No. No mental. It’s a state,
it’s a state,

48:55.837 --> 49:00.416
and that state to achieve, you have
to really meditate

49:00.441 --> 49:10.252
and find time for meditation
every night, every morning.

49:10.277 --> 49:14.493
The more you’ll meditate the better
it will be.

49:14.518 --> 49:24.415
No excuses are to be given or to be
convincing to yourself.

49:24.440 --> 49:30.661
Everything is unimportant. Your ascent
is very important,

49:30.686 --> 49:36.372
if you really want to save this world
from - in this Kali Yuga.

49:36.397 --> 49:41.245
I think today I have made it
very clear to you

49:41.270 --> 49:47.212
what qualities already are instilled
within you.

49:47.237 --> 49:53.793
They are there. They are not dharmas,
but qualities.

49:53.818 --> 49:56.360
They are just within you,

49:56.385 --> 50:02.930
only thing you have turned your attention
to something opposite,

50:02.955 --> 50:08.045
otherwise all these qualities are
already instilled within you.

50:08.070 --> 50:15.209
They are already there. And nothing can
destroy them, except for you yourself.

50:15.234 --> 50:19.820
If you have destroyed them,
nobody can help.

50:19.845 --> 50:23.687
May God bless you all.
