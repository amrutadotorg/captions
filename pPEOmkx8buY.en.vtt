00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:31.208
May God bless you.

00:00:59.458 --> 00:01:01.959
Please be seated.

00:01:24.291 --> 00:01:27.709
(Just to record, hmm?)

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:52.377
It’s such a pleasure to be in the ashram in San Diego.

00:01:53.287 --> 00:01:56.454
And it’s such a beautiful place,

00:01:57.111 --> 00:02:00.944
so much expressing the love of God,

00:02:02.287 --> 00:02:07.412
the Divine, the way it wants to help you at every step.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.870
If you want to have an ashram,

00:02:10.245 --> 00:02:12.329
if you want to have a proper place,

00:02:12.703 --> 00:02:15.454
you want to look after your children well,

00:02:15.828 --> 00:02:19.537
you want to do God’s work,

00:02:19.828 --> 00:02:21.661
everything is looked after,

00:02:22.037 --> 00:02:24.745
everything has to be worked out.

00:02:25.245 --> 00:02:27.619
If it is not worked out,

00:02:27.953 --> 00:02:30.412
then how will you do your work?

00:02:30.911 --> 00:02:32.911
So, it all works out.

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:37.995
And it’s so obvious, the way we have different ashrams,

00:02:38.454 --> 00:02:40.579
such comfortable places

00:02:40.953 --> 00:02:45.661
at a very reasonable amount that we can afford,

00:02:46.037 --> 00:02:48.911
that we can live happily together.

00:02:49.412 --> 00:02:53.745
This is the abode created by love for you.

00:02:54.203 --> 00:02:56.078
So, the first thing we have to remember,

00:02:56.537 --> 00:03:00.661
that among ourselves we should have complete love.

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:09.162
We should not trust people who try to

00:03:10.412 --> 00:03:12.162
divide us,

00:03:12.454 --> 00:03:16.287
who try to give us wrong ideas.

00:03:16.828 --> 00:03:21.203
It’s very easy to make out a person who is a Sahaja yogi

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:23.661
from the heart.

00:03:23.953 --> 00:03:25.245
It’s very easy to make out.

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:27.329
You have to be a little more sensitive

00:03:27.661 --> 00:03:30.120
and you’ll find out such a person very easily.

00:03:30.495 --> 00:03:34.579
Whatever may be the cunning, it can be discovered.

00:03:34.995 --> 00:03:37.245
Nobody can act against God now,

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:41.245
because everything will be discovered and will be found out.

00:03:41.661 --> 00:03:46.745
But we have to have our attention fully

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.995
on your Mother.

00:03:51.953 --> 00:03:54.953
But some people do get little more fanatic

00:03:55.287 --> 00:03:57.203
because they are so attached, doesn’t matter,

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:58.579
you’ll come round.

00:03:58.828 --> 00:04:02.037
But is better to be fanatic than to be doubting.

00:04:02.454 --> 00:04:07.745
So those people who do things little over,

00:04:08.287 --> 00:04:11.661
should commit to a life

00:04:12.037 --> 00:04:13.953
that whatever they see,

00:04:14.287 --> 00:04:16.287
whatever they understand in Sahaja Yoga,

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.412
whatever happens, they will accept it

00:04:19.703 --> 00:04:22.828
without any anxiety about it.

00:04:23.287 --> 00:04:26.619
This is the point, that we build up

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.620
our images about Sahaja Yoga also.

00:04:29.995 --> 00:04:32.412
We cannot build up – it is what it is.

00:04:32.661 --> 00:04:35.203
We cannot build up our image

00:04:35.619 --> 00:04:37.745
that we think Sahaja Yoga should be like this,

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.661
Sahaja Yoga should be like that – it cannot be.

00:04:40.078 --> 00:04:42.953
You cannot compromise, you just cannot compromise.

00:04:43.287 --> 00:04:45.120
It has to be what it is.

00:04:45.454 --> 00:04:48.412
It cannot be anything that you want it to be.

00:04:48.786 --> 00:04:53.579
You cannot mould it, because it is fixed long time back.

00:04:54.078 --> 00:04:56.287
Now it is what it is,

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.037
and that is why it is working out so well, so efficiently.

00:05:01.454 --> 00:05:03.329
But to make it more efficient

00:05:03.661 --> 00:05:06.370
you have to accept its working.

00:05:06.745 --> 00:05:09.745
Like yesterday’s timings, you see:

00:05:10.245 --> 00:05:11.995
I knew there must be something,

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.911
and the time was not yet ready.

00:05:16.412 --> 00:05:17.911
The time I spent here

00:05:18.245 --> 00:05:20.745
would have been spent raising their kundalini,

00:05:21.828 --> 00:05:23.162
unnecessarily wasted.

00:05:23.495 --> 00:05:25.579
Instead of that, five minutes I took,

00:05:25.828 --> 00:05:27.870
it took Me to give them realization.

00:05:28.203 --> 00:05:32.828
So, it’s, everything has to be understood in that light.

00:05:35.037 --> 00:05:38.037
Gradually you will start seeing the divine play,

00:05:38.454 --> 00:05:40.120
how things work out,

00:05:40.579 --> 00:05:43.120
how it helps you.

00:05:43.537 --> 00:05:47.828
But supposing God has brought

00:05:48.412 --> 00:05:50.745
something before you.

00:05:51.329 --> 00:05:55.745
Dr. Worlikar told Me a nice story about this

00:05:56.078 --> 00:05:57.162
which is very interesting,

00:05:57.537 --> 00:05:59.828
that between the Goddess of wealth

00:06:00.162 --> 00:06:04.828
and the Goddess of education there was a little conflict.

00:06:05.245 --> 00:06:09.162
You can say education or the Saraswati,

00:06:09.537 --> 00:06:12.703
which if neglected

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.911
or if too much adored can make you egoistical,

00:06:18.329 --> 00:06:21.162
in the sense that if you become a person

00:06:21.537 --> 00:06:23.162
who is after learning, learning, learning,

00:06:23.495 --> 00:06:26.162
you can be thrown on the other side.

00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:32.412
So, this lady wanted to test the power of wealth.

00:06:32.786 --> 00:06:35.245
So, She said to the Laksmi that

00:06:35.619 --> 00:06:37.786
“All right, let’s see, on this person.”

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.495
This person was a beggar, he needed money,

00:06:42.995 --> 00:06:44.537
and very much.

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:50.287
So, Laksmi put lot of money in a big utensils,

00:06:50.537 --> 00:06:51.745
what we call handa,

00:06:52.162 --> 00:06:55.495
and put it in his way.

00:06:55.911 --> 00:07:00.078
This fellow was walking,

00:07:00.661 --> 00:07:03.953
so Saraswati entered into his mind.

00:07:04.454 --> 00:07:06.620
As soon as Saraswati enters into the mind

00:07:06.995 --> 00:07:10.619
he became egoistical, and he didn’t even look at that,

00:07:10.953 --> 00:07:12.162
he just walked off.

00:07:12.579 --> 00:07:14.370
That was his need, but he walked off.

00:07:14.828 --> 00:07:20.037
So it suggests one thing, that when people become egoistical,

00:07:20.454 --> 00:07:23.037
start making their own plans,

00:07:23.495 --> 00:07:27.287
start making their own suggestions and images they form,

00:07:27.786 --> 00:07:32.495
then what happens that the Divine,

00:07:32.828 --> 00:07:35.911
which is trying to supply for your need,

00:07:36.329 --> 00:07:41.078
for your wants, for your solutions, disappears.

00:07:42.495 --> 00:07:43.703
This is what happens,

00:07:43.953 --> 00:07:48.245
that we do not allow the Divine to have its play.

00:07:48.579 --> 00:07:50.828
This is not only on material level;

00:07:51.245 --> 00:07:53.537
it is true also on emotional level,

00:07:53.911 --> 00:08:00.370
it is true also on our physical level,

00:08:01.953 --> 00:08:04.162
but the best of all

00:08:04.454 --> 00:08:07.245
that it is true about spiritual level also.

00:08:07.619 --> 00:08:08.953
So we should not miss the point.

00:08:09.245 --> 00:08:13.537
Let the Divine play its role, and we should be able to see.

00:08:13.911 --> 00:08:16.412
Like Krishna has said, “Karmanyevadikaraste”

00:08:16.786 --> 00:08:18.703
– “It is our job to do the job.”

00:08:19.162 --> 00:08:22.454
Now we’ve done the puja, aarti’s done.

00:08:22.995 --> 00:08:26.412
I said, “All right, if we can do it, all right;

00:08:26.703 --> 00:08:28.619
if we cannot, I’ll go by the evening plane.”

00:08:29.037 --> 00:08:31.786
I am not bothered, whether I go by morning plane

00:08:32.078 --> 00:08:33.745
or evening plane doesn’t matter.

00:08:34.162 --> 00:08:35.619
I’m absolutely relaxed.

00:08:35.995 --> 00:08:38.412
We discussed certain important points had to be discussed,

00:08:38.786 --> 00:08:40.329
some time had to be spent;

00:08:40.661 --> 00:08:43.329
that has to be done, that’s part of our life.

00:08:43.703 --> 00:08:46.579
So I’m not anxious that I should go by one o’clock plane.

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:48.661
All right, I’ll go by the night plane,

00:08:48.911 --> 00:08:49.870
makes no difference to Me.

00:08:50.203 --> 00:08:55.120
So just to have a very relaxed mind,

00:08:55.537 --> 00:08:58.454
to watch how things come forward.

00:08:58.911 --> 00:09:00.245
People unnecessarily –

00:09:19.537 --> 00:09:21.619
Now when we understand

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:26.245
that the Divine is having its complete play,

00:09:26.579 --> 00:09:30.911
its own working,

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:32.870
the whole thing is working for us,

00:09:33.329 --> 00:09:35.870
for you, the Sahaja yogis.

00:09:36.412 --> 00:09:37.911
Once you realize that,

00:09:38.329 --> 00:09:42.412
then you feel absolutely relaxed and you are in joy.

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:44.329
But when you start,

00:09:44.745 --> 00:09:46.661
“Oh, this should have been like this,

00:09:47.162 --> 00:09:49.037
that should have been like this,”

00:09:49.495 --> 00:09:53.245
then everything is against joy.

00:09:54.162 --> 00:09:56.745
Whichever way it comes is all right.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.828
Once you develop that attitude,

00:09:59.162 --> 00:10:02.162
then the joy will be complete.

00:10:02.911 --> 00:10:04.745
I have seen in emotional life also

00:10:05.203 --> 00:10:07.329
if you people suffer too much.

00:10:07.786 --> 00:10:11.870
The reason is, for everything you start thinking.

00:10:12.828 --> 00:10:16.579
Now in India, how we get married is very simple, you see.

00:10:16.911 --> 00:10:21.120
From childhood we are taught that “You’ll be married,

00:10:21.579 --> 00:10:24.454
so you must learn how to live with your husband,”

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:28.412
and a man is always told how to treat your wife.

00:10:28.786 --> 00:10:30.786
But they don’t know who is the wife and the husband.

00:10:31.162 --> 00:10:35.619
But the husband and wife is just a sort of a symbol.

00:10:36.078 --> 00:10:37.537
They don’t know which one it is;

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:39.661
just could be anyone.

00:10:40.037 --> 00:10:42.953
So, once you accept her as a dharma,

00:10:43.329 --> 00:10:46.745
it comes as a surprise to you, and just enjoy.

00:10:47.203 --> 00:10:49.579
And the whole thing is built up to a point,

00:10:49.953 --> 00:10:52.620
to a moment which has to be auspicious also.

00:10:53.078 --> 00:10:55.745
Of course, they consult the horoscopes,

00:10:56.162 --> 00:10:57.037
that’s an important part,

00:10:57.412 --> 00:10:59.495
because horoscopes if you don’t consult,

00:10:59.828 --> 00:11:00.953
could be quite disastrous.

00:11:01.287 --> 00:11:02.828
So, they consult the horoscopes.

00:11:03.245 --> 00:11:05.329
And if there are so many points

00:11:05.661 --> 00:11:07.619
– they say twenty-six points is ideal

00:11:08.078 --> 00:11:11.037
– then they get married, otherwise they don’t.

00:11:11.537 --> 00:11:17.454
Now it’s not necessary that we do not meet or we meet.

00:11:17.828 --> 00:11:21.120
Sometimes the people meet, talk to each other for one year,

00:11:21.619 --> 00:11:23.745
may be that their marriages are postponed,

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.120
there’s no auspicious time.

00:11:25.495 --> 00:11:27.661
They get some time to be together,

00:11:28.037 --> 00:11:29.620
but never in private;

00:11:30.078 --> 00:11:31.703
they never go into privacy.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.703
So that moment is kept as sacred moment,

00:11:35.162 --> 00:11:37.579
when you are going to meet your husband or wife

00:11:37.911 --> 00:11:39.495
– that’s a very sacred moment,

00:11:39.828 --> 00:11:42.995
so you are concentrated on that point.

00:11:45.828 --> 00:11:48.454
So suddenly it is decided.

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:51.162
Now, you keep that moment as sacred moment.

00:11:51.537 --> 00:11:55.579
Even sometimes it happens that you get some time in between,

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:57.619
quite a lot, after decision;

00:11:57.953 --> 00:12:01.037
could be that you have to continue

00:12:01.537 --> 00:12:03.703
as a feeling, seeing that person.

00:12:04.037 --> 00:12:06.287
But then you do not divert your attention,

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:09.745
it’s completely concentrated effort.

00:12:10.245 --> 00:12:14.203
It clicks, because you just accept it.

00:12:14.911 --> 00:12:17.495
But here people live together for three years,

00:12:17.953 --> 00:12:19.329
then they marry and divorce.

00:12:19.703 --> 00:12:22.203
I mean I can’t understand, even if three years you live,

00:12:22.495 --> 00:12:23.953
seven years you live, ten years they live,

00:12:24.329 --> 00:12:25.245
still they do the same.

00:12:25.579 --> 00:12:28.245
So, what’s the use of knowing each other for so many years,

00:12:28.537 --> 00:12:29.412
still you divorce?

00:12:29.703 --> 00:12:31.995
But it just clicks if you understand that

00:12:32.329 --> 00:12:33.703
it’s a concentrated movement

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.911
where you have everything concentrated,

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:40.911
and you just meet the person and accept that person

00:12:41.287 --> 00:12:42.911
as your companion.

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:47.537
Maybe one or two fail, but if you don’t think about it,

00:12:47.828 --> 00:12:48.995
it won’t fail so much.

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:50.786
Because after marriage you start thinking,

00:12:51.162 --> 00:12:54.537
“Oh I expected this, I expected that.

00:12:54.911 --> 00:12:57.786
I thought this would be so; that’s not so.”

00:12:58.203 --> 00:13:00.786
And always trying to find fault with another,

00:13:01.078 --> 00:13:04.162
not with yourself – that’s the best part of it;

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:07.620
not seeing that how you are adjusting to that person.

00:13:08.203 --> 00:13:10.162
Once you start thinking about marriage,

00:13:10.495 --> 00:13:13.828
marriage is finished, already done with.

00:13:14.911 --> 00:13:19.162
As a child is born to you, without thinking

00:13:19.661 --> 00:13:21.911
what sort of a child is going to come, you love the child,

00:13:22.287 --> 00:13:23.911
in the same way in the marriage

00:13:24.329 --> 00:13:28.162
you’ll have to develop that kind of a concentrated feeling.

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:30.329
Then only marriages will be successful.

00:13:30.661 --> 00:13:33.995
But here, you see, like when you purchase something,

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:35.870
you buy something, all right,

00:13:36.245 --> 00:13:38.370
then you think, “Oh, it was not good,

00:13:38.661 --> 00:13:40.037
I should have bought something else,

00:13:40.412 --> 00:13:42.537
would have been better,” this, that.

00:13:42.953 --> 00:13:44.786
So, you go to another thing.

00:13:45.203 --> 00:13:48.703
Things are different; things are things.

00:13:49.287 --> 00:13:51.120
Human beings are living things,

00:13:51.579 --> 00:13:53.078
they are not dead things

00:13:53.454 --> 00:13:55.370
that you can change one from another,

00:13:55.745 --> 00:13:58.703
“I could have got that one or that one.”

00:13:59.037 --> 00:14:00.953
You cannot go on like this with human beings

00:14:01.287 --> 00:14:04.245
– you’re playing with the Divine then.

00:14:04.995 --> 00:14:08.745
And this is the main point where we feel that

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:13.329
Sahaja yogis have to learn to accept

00:14:13.661 --> 00:14:15.287
with joy, with happiness,

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:19.245
and not to project nonsensical ideas.

00:14:20.703 --> 00:14:23.995
Then only you will find your joy will be complete.

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:25.911
Otherwise it will not be.

00:14:26.329 --> 00:14:29.120
Then if you come, say, to the physical side:

00:14:29.537 --> 00:14:32.495
like here it is, if a woman is very thin,

00:14:32.828 --> 00:14:35.619
she wants to have legs like this, hands like this,

00:14:35.995 --> 00:14:38.828
body like this. Why?

00:14:39.287 --> 00:14:41.162
I mean, imagine everybody to be regimented

00:14:41.495 --> 00:14:43.995
into certain patterns, so much of the waist,

00:14:44.329 --> 00:14:46.370
so much of the thing – horrible it will be.

00:14:46.703 --> 00:14:48.953
I mean you’ll be tired and fed-up with that.

00:14:49.454 --> 00:14:50.828
So, you want to be like that.

00:14:51.245 --> 00:14:54.078
Now the fashion comes in that physically

00:14:54.412 --> 00:14:58.162
we should be Mr. America or whatever you may call it.

00:14:58.537 --> 00:15:01.870
So everybody is doing jogging, everybody running like mad.

00:15:02.329 --> 00:15:05.995
But why? You have your own personality, keep it up.

00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:09.786
You need certain things for your body, the way you are.

00:15:10.203 --> 00:15:12.037
Of course, if your health is not all right

00:15:12.454 --> 00:15:14.703
then you try with your chakras, cure it.

00:15:15.162 --> 00:15:17.579
But to appearances, to think that

00:15:17.995 --> 00:15:19.870
“I should look like this, I should be like that,”

00:15:20.203 --> 00:15:21.828
makes no difference at all.

00:15:22.329 --> 00:15:25.786
So again, another madness starts, so people are very unhappy.

00:15:26.162 --> 00:15:29.870
You see, you go to these very so-called elite classes

00:15:30.287 --> 00:15:33.120
where most of the men are very highly paid,

00:15:33.412 --> 00:15:35.995
educated, top class people,

00:15:36.329 --> 00:15:38.745
women are also educated, everything,

00:15:39.078 --> 00:15:40.619
and what they talk is this only:

00:15:40.953 --> 00:15:43.412
how much calories you eat, this is that.

00:15:43.703 --> 00:15:45.745
You don’t understand, what’s the matter with these people?

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:49.786
Their level is so low.

00:15:50.579 --> 00:15:53.078
That’s a decent talk, and if they come to indecency,

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:55.579
they can go to any level also there.

00:15:55.828 --> 00:15:58.579
So that shows that there has been no evolution

00:15:58.911 --> 00:16:00.078
in that person.

00:16:00.412 --> 00:16:02.537
They just think on those terms.

00:16:02.911 --> 00:16:04.537
And that’s how they become very serious,

00:16:04.828 --> 00:16:06.661
very seriously they discuss all this thing.

00:16:07.078 --> 00:16:10.537
You feel like laughing at them, the way they are stupid.

00:16:10.911 --> 00:16:12.619
So, all these things are regarded

00:16:12.911 --> 00:16:15.203
as so important in a country like America

00:16:15.537 --> 00:16:19.579
or any other country, shows the kind of people they have.

00:16:20.703 --> 00:16:23.287
I mean, in India nobody is so much bothered about the figure.

00:16:23.619 --> 00:16:26.828
At least in My age people never liked very thin girls,

00:16:27.245 --> 00:16:29.454
because they thought they must be very irritable,

00:16:29.786 --> 00:16:31.953
hot-tempered, all the time thinking.

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:34.786
They never liked very thin girls I really tell you;

00:16:35.162 --> 00:16:36.412
even now My husband doesn’t like.

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:38.579
He says, “You see, men have befooled women,

00:16:38.911 --> 00:16:41.619
and that’s why women are doing all these things.”

00:16:42.037 --> 00:16:43.203
You see, he’s a simple man,

00:16:43.579 --> 00:16:45.245
so he thinks that the men have befooled them.

00:16:45.661 --> 00:16:48.620
So, it’s like that, and then they make legs like this

00:16:48.953 --> 00:16:51.245
or teeth like this or nose like this

00:16:51.579 --> 00:16:54.911
and you take a plastic nose, put on – why?

00:16:55.287 --> 00:16:59.619
So physical also imbalances come in when we start thinking.

00:16:59.953 --> 00:17:02.911
Because when we think, we collide with another thinking,

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:05.454
then we form a general thinking,

00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:07.828
then a general pattern is accepted.

00:17:08.162 --> 00:17:11.745
When that is accepted people say, “All right, let’s have it.”

00:17:12.162 --> 00:17:14.537
First, they used to have very tight clothes, you see,

00:17:14.745 --> 00:17:17.162
and one girl was boasting to Me that she wore

00:17:17.454 --> 00:17:19.203
it for eight days and she can’t take it out now.

00:17:19.537 --> 00:17:20.579
I said, “How, how did you manage?”

00:17:20.911 --> 00:17:22.995
She said, “This is something that you can wear

00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:25.745
and jump into the tub,

00:17:26.245 --> 00:17:28.828
and then it shrinks and you can’t take it out.

00:17:29.203 --> 00:17:30.245
You can have bath with this,

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:32.245
you can do what you like with this.”

00:17:32.661 --> 00:17:33.703
I said, “It’s very filthy.”

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:36.412
“No, no, you can wash it nicely and wipe it.”

00:17:36.786 --> 00:17:38.537
But I said, “Why, why do such a thing

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:43.287
which will completely coagulate your blood inside?”

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:44.953
Now they started suffering,

00:17:45.329 --> 00:17:47.661
so now they’re having absolutely loose clothes, you see,

00:17:47.953 --> 00:17:51.537
lanky-pankies, casual, this thing.

00:17:52.037 --> 00:17:53.703
So, they jump from one to another

00:17:54.037 --> 00:17:55.828
when you go on thinking about it,

00:17:56.162 --> 00:17:59.245
trying to devise new methods.

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:01.245
But tradition is different.

00:18:01.619 --> 00:18:05.412
Tradition is that when people are traditional,

00:18:05.745 --> 00:18:08.287
what happens actually, those people who are sensible

00:18:08.619 --> 00:18:09.870
can only become traditional,

00:18:10.329 --> 00:18:12.870
because they understand whatever is to be discarded,

00:18:13.245 --> 00:18:14.454
whatever is not to be discarded.

00:18:14.828 --> 00:18:17.370
And they try to understand how we are going to ascend.

00:18:17.786 --> 00:18:19.537
Not by taking one side,

00:18:19.953 --> 00:18:21.786
but on both the sides we must weigh

00:18:22.245 --> 00:18:24.620
and balance ourselves and then go ahead.

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:26.995
And whatever is to be discarded to be discarded,

00:18:27.412 --> 00:18:30.828
whatever is to be good is to be taken up.

00:18:31.287 --> 00:18:34.911
Like what you call the trial and error business.

00:18:35.287 --> 00:18:37.745
You see, you make the error – all right, give it up;

00:18:38.203 --> 00:18:40.162
then take another – all right, give it up.

00:18:40.579 --> 00:18:43.412
Whatever is good, you keep it and go on with it,

00:18:43.786 --> 00:18:45.786
and that’s how you build up a proper tradition

00:18:46.203 --> 00:18:47.995
for other people to follow.

00:18:48.454 --> 00:18:51.329
But those who think of the new things all the time,

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:53.828
they want to have something new all the time,

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:56.078
then they are very much mistaken,

00:18:56.495 --> 00:18:59.619
that when they do like this what we call is a tomfoolery.

00:18:59.995 --> 00:19:02.287
With the new things they can land themselves

00:19:02.703 --> 00:19:05.454
into terrible messes, and that’s what exactly has happened

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:08.454
to most of the Western countries,

00:19:08.786 --> 00:19:10.162
that everything new they try.

00:19:10.537 --> 00:19:13.911
Now the new craze is cocaine – all right, have cocaine.

00:19:14.412 --> 00:19:16.287
I mean, even I would not be surprised

00:19:16.661 --> 00:19:18.329
if Prince Philip takes to such a thing

00:19:18.703 --> 00:19:20.203
or somebody takes to thing like that.

00:19:20.619 --> 00:19:22.287
I mean, everybody wants to try new,

00:19:22.703 --> 00:19:27.203
and if you say you cannot try then they say, “Why, why not?”

00:19:29.162 --> 00:19:31.995
This is a very big problem with the Western mind.

00:19:32.412 --> 00:19:34.245
So, you all people should also understand,

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:38.037
don’t try new things in Sahaja Yoga.

00:19:40.078 --> 00:19:43.454
Sahaja Yoga is a traditionally built thing.

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:47.370
Don’t try anything new in Sahaja Yoga.

00:19:47.828 --> 00:19:50.412
Whatever we have is more than sufficient,

00:19:50.828 --> 00:19:51.911
you don’t try anything new.

00:19:52.287 --> 00:19:55.037
People who tried new things have jumped into problems,

00:19:55.495 --> 00:19:58.786
so do not try something new.

00:19:59.412 --> 00:20:02.911
Like somebody said that nowadays, you see,

00:20:03.454 --> 00:20:05.828
I heard in London we had some people

00:20:06.203 --> 00:20:08.037
who started giving lectures

00:20:08.579 --> 00:20:12.579
and giving new methods of Sahaja Yoga, suddenly.

00:20:12.995 --> 00:20:14.037
And they all went mad.

00:20:14.495 --> 00:20:16.619
I mean, their vibrations were crazy,

00:20:16.953 --> 00:20:18.495
I didn’t know what to do with them.

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:19.870
I was quite surprised.

00:20:20.203 --> 00:20:22.495
I said, “Why did you try a new method like that?

00:20:22.786 --> 00:20:25.078
What was the need to try a new method?”

00:20:25.495 --> 00:20:28.661
“Oh,” they said, “Well we thought, better try this one.”

00:20:29.078 --> 00:20:30.870
But I said, “I have already told you all the methods.

00:20:31.203 --> 00:20:32.745
Have you tried, have you perfected yourself?

00:20:33.162 --> 00:20:35.203
Better try those which I’ve told you,

00:20:35.661 --> 00:20:39.329
and then you can ask Me and then start something new.

00:20:39.703 --> 00:20:41.703
But you must understand what you are doing.”

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:45.078
And also, I’ve seen mediocre Sahaja yogis always do like that,

00:20:45.495 --> 00:20:49.037
try some new method. And they’ll come out with this thing,

00:20:49.412 --> 00:20:52.245
“Now I’ll tell you how to circulate your breath.”

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:55.162
Why to circulate your breath?

00:20:55.537 --> 00:20:56.953
Suddenly they find out a new method.

00:20:57.287 --> 00:21:00.203
Is a common thing, but these are sometimes could be

00:21:00.537 --> 00:21:03.037
very sinister people also, so be careful.

00:21:03.495 --> 00:21:05.620
There is no need to try new methods.

00:21:05.911 --> 00:21:08.454
Now you have jumped on to that awareness

00:21:08.786 --> 00:21:10.579
where you have to just be steady.

00:21:10.953 --> 00:21:13.329
So, don’t try at this point something new.

00:21:13.786 --> 00:21:17.370
Just steady yourself, steady yourself in balance

00:21:17.786 --> 00:21:20.412
– that’s very important.

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:23.454
Second point is that everyone

00:21:23.745 --> 00:21:26.287
should be knowledgeable in Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:26.703 --> 00:21:29.329
But some people are so funnily knowledgeable

00:21:29.703 --> 00:21:31.911
that I’m sometimes surprised.

00:21:32.412 --> 00:21:35.537
Like there was a fellow who was homosexual

00:21:35.828 --> 00:21:37.203
or nonsensical thing,

00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:39.329
and then he told some people that

00:21:39.661 --> 00:21:42.620
“Yes, you see, Mother says it’s all right once in a while.”

00:21:43.078 --> 00:21:46.245
I never said so. I can never say such a thing.

00:21:46.745 --> 00:21:49.370
Then somebody said, “Drinking – all right, Mother said.”

00:21:49.745 --> 00:21:52.412
How could I say? There’s no compromise.

00:21:52.786 --> 00:21:56.620
Somebody says, “It’s all right, you can do some business.”

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:58.370
I never said so.

00:21:58.786 --> 00:22:00.786
No, you cannot do, these things are not,

00:22:01.203 --> 00:22:02.245
they are not meant for you.

00:22:02.661 --> 00:22:05.078
You don’t have to do it at all. Right?

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:07.953
So, anybody who comes out with such ideas,

00:22:08.329 --> 00:22:09.786
you tell them “nothing of the kind.”

00:22:10.287 --> 00:22:11.329
There’s nothing like that,

00:22:11.703 --> 00:22:14.412
there’s no compromise in Sahaja Yoga, no compromise.

00:22:14.828 --> 00:22:16.412
Whatever methods we have learned,

00:22:16.828 --> 00:22:19.245
let us practice them to establish ourselves

00:22:19.619 --> 00:22:20.454
and establish others.

00:22:20.786 --> 00:22:23.579
You must keep to your maryadas, to your limits.

00:22:24.037 --> 00:22:26.162
Do not try to fly.

00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:29.120
Some people think that they are greater Sahaja yogis

00:22:29.537 --> 00:22:31.412
and they will do this and they will do that.

00:22:31.745 --> 00:22:33.495
Then remember, that is wrong.

00:22:33.911 --> 00:22:35.786
You have to humble down yourself,

00:22:36.245 --> 00:22:38.745
and remember that when you humble down

00:22:39.203 --> 00:22:41.828
you will realize that only the humble people

00:22:42.203 --> 00:22:44.162
are steady people.

00:22:46.911 --> 00:22:49.162
So, there should be complete humility.

00:22:49.661 --> 00:22:52.828
Try to acquire more knowledge about Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:53.329 --> 00:22:54.620
There are so many ways.

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:57.287
I have got all My tapes done already,

00:22:57.661 --> 00:23:01.412
we have got all these Sahaja Yoga books out now

00:23:01.786 --> 00:23:03.870
and also your “Nirmala Yoga” is there

00:23:04.287 --> 00:23:07.412
– so many ways by which you can understand Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:07.703 --> 00:23:10.037
If you don’t understand, you can ask each other,

00:23:10.454 --> 00:23:13.661
try to analyse it the way you want to understand,

00:23:14.162 --> 00:23:17.120
that what Mother is saying, is this is what She’s saying.

00:23:17.537 --> 00:23:20.495
Because My lectures are in very, very simple language.

00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:23.370
I use extremely simple language,

00:23:23.786 --> 00:23:27.661
avoiding all literary language as far as possible of course;

00:23:28.037 --> 00:23:31.162
sometimes I do have to use difficult words, but normally.

00:23:31.619 --> 00:23:35.828
So, but beyond that is a very subtle knowledge flowing.

00:23:36.329 --> 00:23:38.995
So, to understand that sometimes may be difficult,

00:23:39.412 --> 00:23:43.037
you may try to sort of construct something else out of it,

00:23:43.495 --> 00:23:45.619
may try to sort of interpret something.

00:23:45.995 --> 00:23:47.245
If there’s any such problem,

00:23:47.619 --> 00:23:49.786
better consult somebody whom you think

00:23:50.245 --> 00:23:52.078
is capable of advising you.

00:23:52.495 --> 00:23:54.329
But you must accept that.

00:23:54.703 --> 00:23:56.870
You should not put forward your viewpoint,

00:23:57.287 --> 00:23:58.870
and it would be very wrong.

00:23:59.287 --> 00:24:02.995
Then you will be sort of like a derailed train

00:24:03.495 --> 00:24:05.370
which goes out of track.

00:24:05.828 --> 00:24:07.579
We have a track in Sahaja Yoga,

00:24:07.911 --> 00:24:09.661
you must know that, whether you like it or not.

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:13.495
It’s no question of freedom, but the track to ascend.

00:24:13.911 --> 00:24:15.537
You cannot get out of that track.

00:24:15.953 --> 00:24:18.745
If you think you can just move about a little bit,

00:24:19.287 --> 00:24:22.245
have a nice time with all filth

00:24:22.661 --> 00:24:25.495
and then come back to Sahaja Yoga, you won’t be acceptable.

00:24:25.953 --> 00:24:28.495
If you do that then I’ll have to work hard

00:24:28.911 --> 00:24:31.078
to cleanse you out, do this, do that.

00:24:31.579 --> 00:24:34.454
But to keep yourself clean you’d better keep to your tracks

00:24:34.911 --> 00:24:36.120
and don’t get out of it.

00:24:36.579 --> 00:24:41.745
Don’t try to find out new things of doing something

00:24:42.162 --> 00:24:44.203
which is not necessary; why do it?

00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:50.162
I mean, simple thing is to understand it’s a waste of energy.

00:24:50.745 --> 00:24:52.203
I’ve already found it for you,

00:24:52.495 --> 00:24:53.329
why do you want to do it again?

00:24:53.703 --> 00:24:55.120
Like this kind of a blouse

00:24:55.495 --> 00:24:58.329
I’ve been wearing now for the last, I think,

00:24:58.661 --> 00:25:01.995
fifty years or maybe more, this type of a blouse.

00:25:02.454 --> 00:25:05.495
Now My tailor knows that I wear this blouse, this is this,

00:25:05.786 --> 00:25:07.745
this is this. He has got My measurements.

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:09.870
So, I have to just tell him that

00:25:10.245 --> 00:25:12.661
“You get Me a cloth of this kind,

00:25:13.162 --> 00:25:15.120
and just make a blouse for Me.” He makes it.

00:25:15.619 --> 00:25:17.120
For the last so many years I have had,

00:25:17.537 --> 00:25:20.537
about twenty-five years, I had one tailor who does My job.

00:25:20.953 --> 00:25:22.870
He has no headache, I have no headache, no problem.

00:25:23.287 --> 00:25:25.786
Every day if I have to change this pattern,

00:25:26.329 --> 00:25:28.703
make a new sleeve and a new type of a blouse,

00:25:29.078 --> 00:25:31.870
I’ll have a headache, I mean, I tell you.

00:25:32.412 --> 00:25:34.287
So why, why do that? What’s the use?

00:25:34.661 --> 00:25:37.786
Who sees, who is affected by that?

00:25:38.162 --> 00:25:43.120
So unnecessarily we are wasting our energy on these things.

00:25:43.619 --> 00:25:45.703
But I don’t say that you should be regimented,

00:25:46.078 --> 00:25:49.703
by any means, but what I mean that wherever

00:25:50.037 --> 00:25:52.203
you can save your energy of thinking, you should do it.

00:25:52.537 --> 00:25:55.287
For small, small things there’s no need to have varieties,

00:25:55.661 --> 00:25:58.120
and this country as I’ve told you before

00:25:58.579 --> 00:26:00.203
hat every tap has to be different,

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:02.037
every handle is to be different,

00:26:02.495 --> 00:26:05.703
every tile has to be different – what is the need?

00:26:06.162 --> 00:26:08.786
What has to be different is artistic things.

00:26:09.329 --> 00:26:12.245
Sari has to be different because it is artistic.

00:26:12.661 --> 00:26:14.412
But what is in a stitching of a blouse,

00:26:14.786 --> 00:26:15.870
there’s no art in it involved.

00:26:16.287 --> 00:26:18.745
So, whatever is artistic can be different,

00:26:19.203 --> 00:26:21.037
but whatever is mundane need not be.

00:26:21.495 --> 00:26:23.495
In the machinery why should you have

00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:25.078
different types of things, you’ll go mad.

00:26:25.537 --> 00:26:27.786
You go to a shop, there’s twenty types of things,

00:26:28.203 --> 00:26:30.953
you don’t which one to buy, all made by machine only.

00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:32.661
This is good, that is good.

00:26:33.078 --> 00:26:35.245
Then another fellow he comes, he says, “Not good.”

00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:37.120
Then you feel hurt.

00:26:37.495 --> 00:26:41.162
But if you have for mundane things, few things is better,

00:26:41.579 --> 00:26:45.245
that you do not take too many headaches upon yourself.

00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:48.162
So best thing to avoid all these problems

00:26:48.537 --> 00:26:50.870
is to use your new awareness of vibrations.

00:26:51.245 --> 00:26:52.828
So, you save your energies.

00:26:53.245 --> 00:26:54.995
Your energies must be saved,

00:26:55.537 --> 00:26:58.911
and they can be saved if you do not pay attention to things

00:26:59.329 --> 00:27:03.203
which are not your style, where you don’t have to go.

00:27:03.579 --> 00:27:06.162
Just see vibrations. If I go for shopping

00:27:06.619 --> 00:27:08.828
– now I go shopping for various reasons, as you know.

00:27:09.287 --> 00:27:11.579
One is to put My vibrations there;

00:27:11.953 --> 00:27:15.745
another is to put also vibrations on the people

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:17.370
who are in the market.

00:27:17.703 --> 00:27:19.537
Thirdly is to look at all the things,

00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:21.619
so My vibrations go onto them.

00:27:22.037 --> 00:27:24.828
Fourthly, to buy something to be given to others.

00:27:25.329 --> 00:27:28.661
But if I like something it is only through vibrations

00:27:29.037 --> 00:27:31.953
and I buy it somehow,

00:27:33.454 --> 00:27:35.329
because it is to be given to someone

00:27:35.786 --> 00:27:37.703
or something has to be done later.

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:41.745
I just buy it, keep it, it comes very handy.

00:27:43.329 --> 00:27:45.619
That is how your attitude should be.

00:27:46.037 --> 00:27:48.287
But on the contrary if you just go on,

00:27:48.703 --> 00:27:51.287
“I like this, I don’t like it,” about your wife,

00:27:51.703 --> 00:27:55.245
about your jobs, your everything, you’ll be uncertain.

00:27:55.619 --> 00:27:56.620
These days in America

00:27:56.995 --> 00:27:59.537
people are very funny about their jobs also.

00:27:59.911 --> 00:28:01.120
I have to touch these points,

00:28:01.495 --> 00:28:02.619
because you’ll face this problem.

00:28:02.995 --> 00:28:04.828
Today they’re doing some job, “I don’t like it,

00:28:05.245 --> 00:28:06.870
I don’t like my boss” – another job.

00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:09.078
Then they’ll go to another job, they change it.

00:28:09.495 --> 00:28:10.870
Then third job, change it.

00:28:11.203 --> 00:28:13.245
They like to change, you know, all the time

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:15.454
– it’s maddening, I tell you.

00:28:15.828 --> 00:28:17.620
Change their wives, change their house,

00:28:17.995 --> 00:28:20.579
change everything. Why?

00:28:20.995 --> 00:28:24.870
Have only one wife, is better.

00:28:25.329 --> 00:28:28.454
At the most have two jobs in life, is better.

00:28:28.953 --> 00:28:33.245
And at the most change three residences, is better.

00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:35.454
But more than that is a headache.

00:28:35.786 --> 00:28:37.745
I mean, to Me, I have changed forty houses

00:28:38.078 --> 00:28:41.537
because of My husband’s temperament.

00:28:43.579 --> 00:28:47.911
But I’m different, because I’m absolutely a person

00:28:48.287 --> 00:28:50.870
who is not bothered whatever change comes.

00:28:51.329 --> 00:28:53.620
But you are not the same, so don’t waste your energy.

00:28:54.078 --> 00:28:56.037
So, this is very important to understand,

00:28:56.537 --> 00:29:00.287
not to go on changing jobs, is very important.

00:29:00.995 --> 00:29:03.078
Because that is also a craze, I tell you.

00:29:03.619 --> 00:29:05.579
I’ll tell you about Douglas. He used to do that.

00:29:05.995 --> 00:29:07.620
Every time he had financial problem

00:29:08.037 --> 00:29:12.037
because he was changing jobs. So, one day I told him off.

00:29:12.454 --> 00:29:14.703
I said, “Douglas, if you change this job”

00:29:15.037 --> 00:29:16.579
– because I saw the vibrations are all right

00:29:17.078 --> 00:29:18.203
– “if you change this job,

00:29:18.619 --> 00:29:20.162
that you are not going to see Me again.”

00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:24.120
And now today he has got a house, he’s got a car,

00:29:24.537 --> 00:29:28.329
he’s got money in the bank, he’s doing well.

00:29:31.619 --> 00:29:34.245
So that also is a headache for Me,

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:38.828
“Mother, I have no job, I have no money. What am I to do?”

00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:42.995
Every time there are people who come to India, they say,

00:29:43.454 --> 00:29:45.703
“Mother, I have no money, I’m sorry I couldn’t pay You.”

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:47.828
All right, doesn’t matter.

00:29:48.245 --> 00:29:51.203
There are at least, this last time also there were five people.

00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:53.995
But before that I think there were about twenty people.

00:29:54.495 --> 00:29:56.329
So, every time it happens like this.

00:29:56.786 --> 00:29:59.703
So now we must understand, we must have proper jobs.

00:30:00.078 --> 00:30:01.661
We have to be respectable people.

00:30:02.203 --> 00:30:03.828
We must have proper qualifications,

00:30:04.287 --> 00:30:06.495
if possible, better to get some qualifications.

00:30:06.911 --> 00:30:08.745
You are all very intelligent people

00:30:09.245 --> 00:30:11.245
and you can get your qualifications.

00:30:11.703 --> 00:30:14.287
You should have a respectability in the society.

00:30:14.703 --> 00:30:16.661
Otherwise they’ll think that this Mother

00:30:17.078 --> 00:30:20.162
is the Mother of all the beggars.

00:30:22.078 --> 00:30:25.745
So steady yourself in your jobs, in your houses.

00:30:26.245 --> 00:30:30.620
To steady yourself you must learn not to change.

00:30:35.661 --> 00:30:40.370
The change makes you unsteady – do you see the point?

00:30:40.828 --> 00:30:42.245
So, there is no question of changing.

00:30:42.619 --> 00:30:44.703
“I’m going to go through it.”

00:30:45.245 --> 00:30:49.120
Then if it is necessary, if it is not workable,

00:30:49.579 --> 00:30:51.537
then one can change.

00:30:51.953 --> 00:30:54.120
It applies to everything.

00:30:54.661 --> 00:30:58.828
Now, guru-shopping is nothing but change.

00:30:59.329 --> 00:31:02.703
The more gurus you have, the greater headache I have.

00:31:03.162 --> 00:31:05.537
If you have only one guru, say horrible one,

00:31:05.953 --> 00:31:07.495
it’s all right, easy to clear you out.

00:31:07.911 --> 00:31:10.454
But if you have been to twenty, whatever am I to do?

00:31:10.911 --> 00:31:13.287
One fellow who has been to gurus so much

00:31:13.661 --> 00:31:15.454
that I couldn’t understand his personality.

00:31:15.911 --> 00:31:17.454
I said, “What’s the matter with this?”

00:31:17.828 --> 00:31:20.454
Every problem, you name it and it’s there.

00:31:20.953 --> 00:31:22.329
I said, “What sort of a fellow is this?”

00:31:22.661 --> 00:31:23.745
So, I said, “All right, write it down

00:31:24.162 --> 00:31:25.412
all the names of all the gurus you have been to.”

00:31:25.786 --> 00:31:29.953
He wrote three foolscap papers on both the sides.

00:31:30.661 --> 00:31:32.745
I said, “I’m sorry, sir, I can’t help you.”

00:31:33.203 --> 00:31:34.495
He said, “Mother, You have to,

00:31:34.828 --> 00:31:36.579
because there’s a very immediate problem.”

00:31:36.953 --> 00:31:38.745
I said, “What is the immediate problem?”

00:31:39.203 --> 00:31:41.370
“That now I am becoming a woman.”

00:31:41.828 --> 00:31:44.620
I said, “Hah?”

00:31:45.078 --> 00:31:48.537
“The doctors have said that now I’m becoming a woman.”

00:31:49.245 --> 00:31:51.579
I said, “That’s really an immediate problem.”

00:31:51.995 --> 00:31:55.703
I said, “That much I can stop, but you need lot of cleansing.”

00:31:56.287 --> 00:31:58.329
And he used to sometimes look like Hanumana,

00:31:58.703 --> 00:32:00.203
sometimes he looks like a madman,

00:32:00.619 --> 00:32:01.745
he used to look like anything,

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:04.537
because so many gurus in him were working it out.

00:32:04.953 --> 00:32:08.620
Ultimately that he got himself cleansed out

00:32:08.995 --> 00:32:10.870
and his problem was solved,

00:32:11.329 --> 00:32:13.412
but even now I would not say that he is a Sahaja yogi;

00:32:13.745 --> 00:32:16.329
though he’s very learned, knows all about Sanskrit

00:32:16.619 --> 00:32:17.703
because he has been to so many gurus,

00:32:18.037 --> 00:32:21.287
every type of guru he has been.

00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:25.620
This has come by change – “what’s wrong?”

00:32:26.495 --> 00:32:30.495
So, once you come to Sahaja Yoga, then stop.

00:32:31.203 --> 00:32:34.037
Stop everything else.

00:32:34.579 --> 00:32:37.620
Second point that I stressed was this,

00:32:38.162 --> 00:32:40.661
that in Sahaja Yoga once you come,

00:32:41.162 --> 00:32:43.995
focus yourself to Me and Sahaja Yoga first,

00:32:44.495 --> 00:32:45.412
and then other things.

00:32:45.786 --> 00:32:47.287
Like Christians when they come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:32:47.703 --> 00:32:49.745
they can’t accept Ganesh.

00:32:50.287 --> 00:32:54.203
Indians who come to Sahaja Yoga cannot accept Christ.

00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:58.454
Muslims who come to Sahaja Yoga cannot take to puja.

00:32:58.995 --> 00:33:01.495
Everybody is coming with a load behind them.

00:33:01.911 --> 00:33:05.037
So better come and put them at My feet, finished.

00:33:05.495 --> 00:33:08.245
Now you see them through My prism,

00:33:08.745 --> 00:33:12.786
through Me – is better to understand that way.

00:33:13.245 --> 00:33:15.620
And those who have understood Me that way,

00:33:16.162 --> 00:33:19.037
just understand Sahaja Yoga in a perfect manner.

00:33:19.495 --> 00:33:22.078
There’s no fanaticism of the past,

00:33:22.537 --> 00:33:24.245
neither of Sahaja Yoga either.

00:33:24.619 --> 00:33:27.911
So, they understand that this is all the same as Mother is,

00:33:28.329 --> 00:33:30.786
and there’s nothing to be sticking

00:33:31.203 --> 00:33:32.828
onto one thing or to another.

00:33:33.329 --> 00:33:36.329
But it doesn’t mean that if you call Me

00:33:36.703 --> 00:33:39.287
the Goddess Kali you are insulting Me,

00:33:39.703 --> 00:33:42.995
or if you call Me Mataji Nirmala Devi you’re elevating Me

00:33:43.412 --> 00:33:45.495
– it’s all there.

00:33:45.995 --> 00:33:48.995
So one has to understand that all this

00:33:49.745 --> 00:33:52.786
is related to our own compartments.

00:33:53.245 --> 00:33:56.412
God has no compartments like that.

00:33:57.162 --> 00:33:59.828
It is not that America exists in His mind,

00:34:00.329 --> 00:34:02.619
or it is not that anything exists in mind.

00:34:03.078 --> 00:34:06.370
Do we exist like “now I am only my Vishuddhi”

00:34:06.828 --> 00:34:07.953
– do we exist like that?

00:34:08.370 --> 00:34:10.495
Or “I’m only my nose” – do we?

00:34:10.953 --> 00:34:12.537
We exist as the whole body.

00:34:13.037 --> 00:34:17.162
So, God exists – though He has a nose, He has His ears, say,

00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:19.995
everything is there; but He exists as God.

00:34:20.454 --> 00:34:22.661
He doesn’t exist like a nose, separate,

00:34:23.162 --> 00:34:25.037
doesn’t exist like only America separate,

00:34:25.454 --> 00:34:27.995
but He’s existing as the whole,

00:34:28.495 --> 00:34:33.703
everything related to the whole.

00:34:34.537 --> 00:34:37.037
And when such a thing happens to us

00:34:37.495 --> 00:34:40.661
that now we are related to the whole, the Primordial Being,

00:34:41.203 --> 00:34:42.911
we should not relate ourselves

00:34:43.329 --> 00:34:44.537
to something that will localize us

00:34:44.995 --> 00:34:47.329
because of our conditionings.

00:34:47.870 --> 00:34:49.412
No localization should be there,

00:34:49.661 --> 00:34:51.537
we should be in circulation.

00:34:52.037 --> 00:34:55.162
I find it difficult for people who have been Catholics

00:34:55.619 --> 00:34:59.620
to worship Shri Ganesh with the same respect,

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:01.203
because they are conditioned.

00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:03.370
So, try to leave it for a while, Christ,

00:35:03.745 --> 00:35:05.037
completely leave Him alone.

00:35:05.579 --> 00:35:08.953
Come to Sahaja Yoga, then you’ll see Him in proper light.

00:35:09.495 --> 00:35:11.245
Because this is the problem is,

00:35:11.703 --> 00:35:16.995
that unless and until you come inside and see for yourself

00:35:17.370 --> 00:35:19.661
that all roads have come to this one thing,

00:35:20.203 --> 00:35:22.495
so they are just the same, there’s no difference at all.

00:35:22.911 --> 00:35:24.329
First come inside.

00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:26.412
Give up everything, come inside.

00:35:26.786 --> 00:35:29.078
Then you will know that it’s all the same.

00:35:29.579 --> 00:35:31.287
And this is very important,

00:35:31.745 --> 00:35:33.953
and once you see that,

00:35:34.412 --> 00:35:37.661
it’s such a beautiful thing that you have no complications

00:35:38.162 --> 00:35:41.870
of any kind, belonging to any particular cult

00:35:42.370 --> 00:35:44.745
or particular guru or a particular thing.

00:35:45.203 --> 00:35:49.037
Even so-called religions are like cults if you see to it,

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:51.245
they are like cults, they have conditionings.

00:35:51.661 --> 00:35:53.703
They have not given you anything but conditioning

00:35:54.037 --> 00:35:55.203
and illusions.

00:35:55.579 --> 00:35:56.786
So, we are not to live with illusions,

00:35:57.162 --> 00:35:58.245
we have to live with reality.

00:35:58.619 --> 00:36:02.412
And the reality is that, that all these essences are one,

00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:04.953
and we have to be inside them

00:36:05.412 --> 00:36:09.120
so that we can see them, all of them as one.

00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:13.454
This is also very important thing in country like America,

00:36:13.786 --> 00:36:16.911
I feel, because there are such diverse ideas,

00:36:17.329 --> 00:36:20.703
such diverse ideas that I, I’m surprised at them.

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:23.162
Everything you name it is in America.

00:36:23.579 --> 00:36:26.245
The other day I developed one thing called Mormon,

00:36:26.786 --> 00:36:29.870
Mormon or something. Mormon.

00:36:30.412 --> 00:36:32.120
Name it and it’s in America.

00:36:32.495 --> 00:36:36.370
I don’t know how all the varieties have gathered here.

00:36:36.786 --> 00:36:39.828
Every sort of a guru, I mean, you discover them here.

00:36:40.162 --> 00:36:41.454
I had never heard of so many names.

00:36:41.828 --> 00:36:44.329
Whenever I come, I’d find a new guru coming up.

00:36:44.745 --> 00:36:48.203
Why America is the place where all these prosper like this,

00:36:48.537 --> 00:36:49.745
like mushrooms, you see?

00:36:50.162 --> 00:36:52.953
A mushroom is growing, that is – is it a rottening thing?

00:36:53.412 --> 00:36:56.287
Only mushroom grows as fungus.

00:36:56.911 --> 00:37:01.412
Is it rottening, this country? What’s happening? Why?

00:37:01.953 --> 00:37:04.245
It is the mind of human beings.

00:37:04.745 --> 00:37:08.412
The mind of human beings here always wants a new thing,

00:37:08.786 --> 00:37:11.203
and that’s why a supply comes.

00:37:11.661 --> 00:37:13.745
As a result of that they become unsteady.

00:37:14.245 --> 00:37:17.537
So, the main problem of American character

00:37:17.995 --> 00:37:20.454
is that they are very unsteady people.

00:37:22.412 --> 00:37:24.870
You ask them, “How are you?” They also say ….

00:37:25.703 --> 00:37:26.703
Understand whatever you like.

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:30.162
They’ll never say “How are you?” ….

00:37:31.203 --> 00:37:32.579
What do you understand with that?

00:37:32.911 --> 00:37:35.037
I mean, an Indian person can’t understand.

00:37:35.537 --> 00:37:37.537
If somebody says like that, an Indian, you see,

00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:38.703
if you ask him, “How are you?”

00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:42.412
and he says like this, they’ll say, “Are you mad?”

00:37:45.786 --> 00:37:48.537
Then if you ask them, “Do you understand this?”

00:37:48.911 --> 00:37:51.120
“I’m confused.”

00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:53.078
An Indian will never say such a thing,

00:37:53.454 --> 00:37:55.412
“I’m confused.” He’s cocksure.

00:37:55.870 --> 00:37:57.995
“I’m confused” means, are you a lunatic or what?

00:37:58.495 --> 00:38:02.454
Why are you confused? Something wrong with your brain?

00:38:04.078 --> 00:38:06.078
So, all these ideas, you see,

00:38:06.619 --> 00:38:09.203
are tending towards our unsteadiness,

00:38:09.661 --> 00:38:11.911
frivolousness, superficiality.

00:38:12.412 --> 00:38:15.287
You are really bombarded by superficiality,

00:38:15.786 --> 00:38:17.412
bombarded, I can see that.

00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:20.786
Absolutely from everywhere, you see, the media, this, that:

00:38:21.162 --> 00:38:22.786
it’s nothing but superficial.

00:38:23.203 --> 00:38:26.828
It really kills the inner germ in the human being.

00:38:27.329 --> 00:38:28.454
And you want to live with it,

00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:31.162
then you want to think on those lines,

00:38:32.037 --> 00:38:35.454
and really you lose yourself, all contact with yourself is lost.

00:38:35.745 --> 00:38:38.203
Under all these circumstances one has to know

00:38:38.537 --> 00:38:40.162
one beautiful fact,

00:38:40.579 --> 00:38:44.037
that so many seekers are born in this country.

00:38:44.454 --> 00:38:48.454
It’s America which I visited the first.

00:38:49.703 --> 00:38:52.745
And I’m sure San Diego is the place where it will start,

00:38:53.078 --> 00:38:55.703
I have a feeling.

00:38:56.370 --> 00:38:58.911
[Marathi]

00:39:01.995 --> 00:39:04.412
So this is a place very important, and I’m nice,

00:39:04.745 --> 00:39:07.703
I’m happy that you have arranged this wonderful puja,

00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:09.619
and we should do this puja.

00:39:10.037 --> 00:39:15.078
And I am sure by this we will have a time,

00:39:15.661 --> 00:39:19.245
especially good time coming

00:39:19.786 --> 00:39:25.370
where we’ll have on one side American evolution,

00:39:25.786 --> 00:39:28.203
on the other side, Mexican.

00:39:28.661 --> 00:39:31.579
This we can work out from San Diego.

00:39:31.995 --> 00:39:35.495
It’s a beautiful day that you have asked for this puja.

00:39:35.953 --> 00:39:37.454
I’m very happy about it.

00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:39.703
Today is the day of the Goddess,

00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:44.828
[Marathi] – Thrayodashi.

00:39:48.786 --> 00:39:51.745
Thrayodashi is the best, thirteenth day.

00:39:52.245 --> 00:39:57.162
[Marathi]

00:40:09.287 --> 00:40:13.120
See the vibrations, you don’t need any puja!

00:40:19.703 --> 00:40:22.370
There’s no need to have a puja, really, it is so much today.

00:40:22.745 --> 00:40:23.995
So today is a great day,

00:40:24.329 --> 00:40:26.579
and I’m happy he’s asked for this puja here.

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:31.703
So, now to begin with ….

00:40:32.245 --> 00:40:35.370
Now if you have any problems, any questions,

00:40:35.786 --> 00:40:37.911
you must let Me know.

00:40:38.454 --> 00:40:40.370
One thing, a Sahaja yogi should not be

00:40:40.703 --> 00:40:43.911
a serious person, that’s one thing.

00:40:45.537 --> 00:40:48.203
That doesn’t behove a Sahaja yogi to be serious.

00:40:48.703 --> 00:40:51.120
You should be smiling, laughing, enjoying.

00:40:51.579 --> 00:40:54.078
If he’s a serious person then he’s not a Sahaja yogi.

00:40:54.495 --> 00:40:56.745
I can’t keep serious for more than five minutes,

00:40:57.078 --> 00:40:58.412
at the most five minutes.

00:40:58.786 --> 00:41:01.620
Even if I have to scold somebody, I prepare Myself,

00:41:02.078 --> 00:41:04.454
then I come down and I shout,

00:41:04.828 --> 00:41:07.495
and then after five minutes if I don’t run away

00:41:07.995 --> 00:41:09.786
then you’ll find Me again laughing.

00:41:10.287 --> 00:41:12.579
Can’t – it’s all a joke!

00:41:17.911 --> 00:41:21.037
So, nobody should be serious, that’s one thing.

00:41:21.495 --> 00:41:22.619
Nobody should be serious.

00:41:22.953 --> 00:41:24.911
You should be always smiling and happy people,

00:41:25.370 --> 00:41:27.828
because there is joy within you. What is there?

00:41:28.287 --> 00:41:33.078
Only by thinking “I’m miserable, I’m miserable,” you see

00:41:34.745 --> 00:41:36.579
– that’s French style!

00:41:37.037 --> 00:41:39.329
French, you know, when I went there first time, they told Me,

00:41:39.703 --> 00:41:45.412
“Mother, You look too happy” – for French.

00:41:45.995 --> 00:41:47.037
So, I said, “What should I do?”

00:41:47.454 --> 00:41:49.037
Said, “Do You see, they are all very,

00:41:49.412 --> 00:41:51.703
they think they are very Misérables people, this, that.”

00:41:52.245 --> 00:41:53.953
So, I said, “All right.” So I went and said,

00:41:54.287 --> 00:41:56.120
“Now see, you are all les Misérables”

00:41:56.579 --> 00:41:59.370
– you know Victor Hugo has written this “Les Misérables”

00:41:59.786 --> 00:42:01.745
– so I said, “All right, you les miserables.

00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:04.454
Now I am a person who is not miserable at all.

00:42:04.911 --> 00:42:07.619
And you will be miserable in any case if you have,

00:42:08.037 --> 00:42:12.454
every third house you have a pub,

00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:15.162
every tenth house you have a prostitute,

00:42:15.703 --> 00:42:19.037
so what will happen? I mean, you are in for it.”

00:42:19.745 --> 00:42:20.745
That’s what it is.

00:42:21.162 --> 00:42:23.703
And even Yogi Mahajan told Me that

00:42:24.245 --> 00:42:27.203
“Mother, we want Your photograph which is very serious,

00:42:27.537 --> 00:42:28.870
it is hard to get one,

00:42:29.329 --> 00:42:32.620
and we must put a face which is very serious.”

00:42:33.162 --> 00:42:35.620
And ultimately, he ended up with a photograph

00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:37.537
which was horrid.

00:42:38.037 --> 00:42:40.661
When he told Me, “It’s a very nice photograph,

00:42:41.078 --> 00:42:44.329
You look so serene,” this, that and all the descriptions.

00:42:44.661 --> 00:42:47.495
When I saw the photograph I said, “It’s horrid!”

00:42:48.037 --> 00:42:49.661
He said, “Really?”

00:42:50.037 --> 00:42:52.620
I said, “All right, let Me tell you who has done this.”

00:42:53.037 --> 00:42:56.370
He said, “Who?” I told him the name and he was shocked.

00:42:56.828 --> 00:42:59.245
I said, “That’s the lady who has given you,

00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:01.412
and you know where she is today.”

00:43:01.911 --> 00:43:05.786
Was shocked how I told the name “Jane.”

00:43:09.037 --> 00:43:12.037
I said, “This is the photograph you are sending to Americans.”

00:43:12.454 --> 00:43:15.287
But I know Americans will be attracted by that photograph,

00:43:15.579 --> 00:43:18.579
because they are miserable themselves, you see.

00:43:19.037 --> 00:43:21.329
But such people who are attracted

00:43:21.661 --> 00:43:24.412
to that kind of a photograph will drop out in no time,

00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:28.329
they will not stick on – you don’t understand that point.

00:43:28.828 --> 00:43:30.370
They are not the type who’ll stick on.

00:43:30.661 --> 00:43:32.162
Like in Scotland, I went there

00:43:32.579 --> 00:43:35.620
and there was a photograph I saw, and I got a shock.

00:43:36.078 --> 00:43:38.828
We had gone to a restaurant where we were to have our food,

00:43:39.162 --> 00:43:41.537
and I saw My photograph and I said, “Who has done this one?”

00:43:41.911 --> 00:43:44.287
They said, “This is the copy of one of the Australian ones.”

00:43:44.703 --> 00:43:47.287
I said, “But who has done it?

00:43:47.786 --> 00:43:50.579
Because this is not good – very bad.”

00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:56.412
So, they said, “This is done by someone, suddenly.”

00:43:56.786 --> 00:43:57.953
I said, “I’ll name the person,”

00:43:58.370 --> 00:44:01.620
and I told them who has done it: Hilary.

00:44:02.454 --> 00:44:04.661
They were all amazed at it.

00:44:05.203 --> 00:44:07.495
I said, “This photograph is no good.”

00:44:07.870 --> 00:44:10.162
But now they had put it everywhere. I said, “Let it be.”

00:44:10.620 --> 00:44:14.370
So many people came to My program, all funny types, you know.

00:44:14.786 --> 00:44:16.911
Some had one eye, some had one nose,

00:44:17.245 --> 00:44:21.287
some had something else wrong, everything missing.

00:44:21.661 --> 00:44:25.037
“Oh God,” I said, “this is the thing of the photograph.”

00:44:25.619 --> 00:44:28.828
And not one person came back.

00:44:29.454 --> 00:44:30.953
We had at least about five,

00:44:31.329 --> 00:44:34.162
six hundred people for the program, all like this, you see.

00:44:34.579 --> 00:44:37.370
[Marathi]

00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:42.329
And none of them came back, not one person.

00:44:42.911 --> 00:44:47.078
All bhoots, attracted by the bhoot; and I could see

00:44:47.412 --> 00:44:50.995
on My photograph that it was just repelling it.

00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:56.953
So those who take My photograph also

00:44:57.537 --> 00:45:02.120
reflect in the photograph.

00:45:02.911 --> 00:45:06.287
You must have seen Ray’s photograph come out very well.

00:45:06.745 --> 00:45:08.287
I don’t which one is Ray’s here,

00:45:08.661 --> 00:45:10.870
but Ray’s photographs used to be very good.

00:45:11.329 --> 00:45:13.953
And this time Ray, he has a funny wife, I think.

00:45:14.454 --> 00:45:16.370
He went to India, and Indians told Me,

00:45:16.828 --> 00:45:18.995
“Mother, I don’t know how this Ray is so ruined.”

00:45:19.329 --> 00:45:20.162
In India it doesn’t happen.

00:45:20.537 --> 00:45:22.619
Once a Sahaja yogi, then they improve.

00:45:23.037 --> 00:45:26.370
But this fellow was just the opposite – now what to do?

00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:28.828
They said, “Mother, he’s all gone down, what to do?”

00:45:29.245 --> 00:45:32.412
I said, “Must have been something wrong. What to do?”

00:45:32.911 --> 00:45:34.620
When I came back, you see,

00:45:34.995 --> 00:45:36.703
Ray brought three or four photographs of Mine.

00:45:37.037 --> 00:45:38.786
When he showed, everybody was shocked.

00:45:39.203 --> 00:45:42.120
“These are not Mother’s photographs.”

00:45:42.703 --> 00:45:46.661
And he had to withdraw them. This is what it is.

00:45:47.037 --> 00:45:49.579
Same Ray who made such beautiful photographs

00:45:49.995 --> 00:45:52.661
was having horrible photographs nowadays.

00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:57.203
So, in everything what you do, everything that you achieve,

00:45:57.661 --> 00:45:59.120
you can make it out.

00:45:59.619 --> 00:46:04.786
You suddenly become an extremely posh person, you can say,

00:46:05.245 --> 00:46:07.828
with a finesse, once you are a good Sahaja yogi.

00:46:08.203 --> 00:46:11.329
Everything comes in proper stream.

00:46:11.745 --> 00:46:14.579
You can make it out, very simple ways

00:46:15.037 --> 00:46:20.619
of such a person are so pleasing and so soothing.

00:46:22.619 --> 00:46:26.579
So, on these points I have covered lots of things

00:46:26.911 --> 00:46:30.995
which I wanted to say, and that end with it

00:46:31.370 --> 00:46:35.537
I would say that as Vishuddhis you have to become the sakshi,

00:46:35.911 --> 00:46:38.203
the witness. You have to become the witness.

00:46:38.703 --> 00:46:41.579
And to become the witness there has to be a detachment.

00:46:41.995 --> 00:46:44.911
That doesn’t mean you live on a shoestring by any chance,

00:46:45.370 --> 00:46:48.370
but try to have a detachment.

00:46:48.786 --> 00:46:52.620
Thank God this time the experience of the Sahaja yogis

00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:54.661
from America was not so bad.

00:46:55.078 --> 00:46:56.329
They were very good people,

00:46:56.703 --> 00:46:59.619
they adjusted themselves well and they enjoyed themselves.

00:46:59.995 --> 00:47:01.287
It was fine.

00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:07.287
And I hope more and more will come and will enjoy themselves.

00:47:07.703 --> 00:47:10.495
And as you know the new programming has taken place.

00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:13.995
Is better you people tell us if you are coming or not.

00:47:14.454 --> 00:47:16.412
But also, don’t change last minute,

00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:21.495
it creates problems for us, for everyone.

00:47:21.995 --> 00:47:25.162
So please don’t change; if you’re not coming, it’s all right.

00:47:25.619 --> 00:47:28.245
You will have a certain date, by that time you decide,

00:47:28.619 --> 00:47:31.245
don’t change. You see it’s only Americans who did this,

00:47:31.661 --> 00:47:34.120
nobody else.

00:47:34.537 --> 00:47:35.620
And we told people,

00:47:35.995 --> 00:47:38.454
“Now no more, let’s give more chance to Americans are coming,

00:47:38.786 --> 00:47:41.203
we should give them more chance; so no, you are not coming.”

00:47:41.619 --> 00:47:44.619
So poor things, they came for ten days, five days,

00:47:45.162 --> 00:47:48.619
because we could not arrange for them.

00:47:49.579 --> 00:47:51.412
So, you should not change your ideas.

00:47:51.953 --> 00:47:55.329
If you are coming you can decide up to a point,

00:47:55.786 --> 00:47:57.620
if you are coming or not coming.

00:47:58.078 --> 00:48:01.703
If you are not coming you just say, “Yes, we are not coming,”

00:48:02.078 --> 00:48:04.995
or if you are coming you just say,

00:48:05.370 --> 00:48:07.537
“Yes we are coming,” and you do it.

00:48:07.995 --> 00:48:11.454
At least that much you should not change.

00:48:12.661 --> 00:48:16.454
So again, I request you to keep to your schedules and things,

00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:20.162
because it really upsets the whole thing.

00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:23.911
Because now we are working on the rhythm of the Divine,

00:48:24.454 --> 00:48:26.953
and we have no business to upset the rhythm.

00:48:28.995 --> 00:48:31.661
You may be Americans, but as you know in Sahaja Yoga

00:48:32.162 --> 00:48:34.619
Americans are not placed very high up.

00:48:35.162 --> 00:48:36.661
You know that very well.

00:48:37.162 --> 00:48:40.078
And we think Italians are much better off;

00:48:40.619 --> 00:48:45.579
they take to Sahaja Yoga just like a fish takes to water.

00:48:46.828 --> 00:48:50.162
So, Americans have to work a little harder,

00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:55.703
they have to do a little more to get to that adjustments.

00:48:57.745 --> 00:49:01.870
What to do? Such a great a country, so many seekers,

00:49:02.370 --> 00:49:04.870
but they are already ruined – what am I to do?

00:49:05.370 --> 00:49:06.412
Trying My level best.

00:49:06.786 --> 00:49:09.162
You all should help and understand the difficulties,

00:49:09.619 --> 00:49:11.828
and you have to be kind to the newcomers and see

00:49:12.329 --> 00:49:15.329
that you put them right.

00:49:16.370 --> 00:49:22.412
So, we have to think of our ascent from San Diego,

00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:26.245
and from this corner we are going to enlighten

00:49:26.661 --> 00:49:29.828
the whole of America.

00:49:30.245 --> 00:49:33.329
For practical purposes I’ve decided

00:49:33.745 --> 00:49:37.078
that Dr. Worlikar should be in charge

00:49:37.537 --> 00:49:43.245
in the eastern side

00:49:43.786 --> 00:49:46.495
[Marathi]

00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:49.995
– western side.

00:49:50.412 --> 00:49:53.078
For us, New York is already western, all right;

00:49:53.579 --> 00:49:56.995
and the eastern side is, the New York side

00:49:57.454 --> 00:50:00.495
can be managed by him.

00:50:00.911 --> 00:50:03.661
Because there’s a, like a two countries it is, two countries,

00:50:04.078 --> 00:50:05.370
two different types of thing.

00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:07.619
So that is how it is to be managed.

00:50:08.203 --> 00:50:12.579
Money matters: you should do deal with money matters

00:50:12.911 --> 00:50:14.037
with his consent.

00:50:14.495 --> 00:50:18.037
So, I told him how I do it is that the money

00:50:18.454 --> 00:50:21.745
is kept in the bank under the name of the

00:50:22.203 --> 00:50:24.412
registered name or whichever way it is,

00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:30.619
and they have the check book, but I have to sign.

00:50:31.537 --> 00:50:33.661
So, you keep the check book but he has to sign,

00:50:34.037 --> 00:50:36.287
so he sees what you are spending.

00:50:36.745 --> 00:50:38.037
So, check is there.

00:50:38.495 --> 00:50:40.370
Or you do the same there, see,

00:50:40.703 --> 00:50:43.203
so that she keeps the check book but you sign,

00:50:43.579 --> 00:50:45.745
so you know how much is being spent.

00:50:46.203 --> 00:50:47.245
So, there’s a check.

00:50:47.661 --> 00:50:50.037
Of course, as far as you people are concerned,

00:50:50.370 --> 00:50:52.495
I know it’s all right, but still ….

00:50:52.911 --> 00:50:57.120
Why I do so many things, just to make you understand.

00:50:57.703 --> 00:51:02.245
Like if you give Me puja money, I keep a packet of that.

00:51:02.745 --> 00:51:04.078
I keep an account of that.

00:51:04.537 --> 00:51:06.120
There’s no need: who’s going to ask Me

00:51:06.495 --> 00:51:07.953
what did I do with the puja money?

00:51:08.412 --> 00:51:11.370
But I do, I do keep it.

00:51:11.828 --> 00:51:15.120
And then what do I do with the puja money is that

00:51:15.619 --> 00:51:18.745
I want to use it for your puja materials, puja things,

00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:20.078
for presents and things.

00:51:20.370 --> 00:51:22.495
So, I keep. I need not do it, that’s My money,

00:51:22.828 --> 00:51:25.786
at least that much is Mine,

00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:28.619
but My pleasure is such.

00:51:28.995 --> 00:51:31.412
So that is how one must know that

00:51:31.703 --> 00:51:37.120
if Mother is so strict with it, why not we?

00:51:37.995 --> 00:51:40.703
You have to give money in puja, no doubt,

00:51:41.162 --> 00:51:42.329
because that has to be.

00:51:42.661 --> 00:51:44.245
First, we used to take one “p”.

00:51:44.703 --> 00:51:48.745
Then I went to two “p”, then to five “p’s”, ten “p’s”

00:51:49.245 --> 00:51:51.786
– it has increased like that.

00:51:52.287 --> 00:51:53.579
And for these pujas then,

00:51:53.911 --> 00:51:55.703
for the main pujas that we are going to have,

00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:58.495
one on New York, they have decided certain amount.

00:51:58.870 --> 00:52:00.661
That is your decision, I never said anything,

00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:03.661
because I was only up to one pound, I was there.

00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:06.579
Then I don’t know, I got lost with these people.

00:52:07.245 --> 00:52:10.620
So whatever they decide, that is there,

00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:14.579
is the money that is collected under the name of puja,

00:52:15.037 --> 00:52:18.995
which I have to take for the Nabhi Chakra.

00:52:19.495 --> 00:52:23.620
You have to do it with heart, just like the Shabari style,

00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:28.911
and everything will fall in proper places.

00:52:30.078 --> 00:52:34.786
So one can say that

00:52:35.329 --> 00:52:38.412
Sahaja Yoga is not an extreme thing.

00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:40.620
We do give money;

00:52:41.037 --> 00:52:43.620
only the Sahaja yogis can donate money.

00:52:44.203 --> 00:52:46.703
Say, for food here you have to pay,

00:52:47.203 --> 00:52:48.537
for the house you have to pay.

00:52:48.911 --> 00:52:51.870
You do pay, you don’t live here like parasites.

00:52:52.370 --> 00:52:54.454
We don’t want parasites around us.

00:52:54.911 --> 00:52:56.995
But it doesn’t also mean that you rob

00:52:57.370 --> 00:53:00.495
a Sahaja yogi completely and make him a pauper,

00:53:00.911 --> 00:53:04.870
and build your own Rolls Royces!

00:53:07.329 --> 00:53:13.037
So it is not also the other way, that you people rob Me.

00:53:16.995 --> 00:53:21.287
So one has to understand that Sahaja Yoga is give and take,

00:53:21.703 --> 00:53:24.037
in a proper certain manners,

00:53:24.537 --> 00:53:28.703
and that has to be properly done with grace,

00:53:29.203 --> 00:53:33.495
with understanding, with a beautiful feeling

00:53:33.953 --> 00:53:37.619
that we are all part and parcel of the whole.

00:53:40.579 --> 00:53:44.537
And for which America is responsible,

00:53:44.995 --> 00:53:48.786
because America has to become the Virat.

00:53:52.078 --> 00:53:56.037
The Vishuddhi has to become the Virat.

00:53:57.870 --> 00:54:00.537
What a responsibility!

00:54:01.078 --> 00:54:03.078
So don’t quarrel among yourselves,

00:54:03.579 --> 00:54:06.786
don’t quarrel among husband and wife.

00:54:07.370 --> 00:54:14.245
Try to be one in complete unison, enjoy each other.

00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:17.786
That’s very important. All right.

00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:19.203
So may God bless you.

01:15:42.495 --> 01:15:44.620
Her husband?

01:15:44.995 --> 01:15:47.745
He’s washed My feet?

01:15:48.537 --> 01:15:52.619
You both? Both are washed?

01:15:53.745 --> 01:15:56.203
All right.

01:15:57.412 --> 01:15:59.287
So, do you want to wash it again?

01:15:59.661 --> 01:16:03.120
All right. Now come.

01:16:05.870 --> 01:16:09.120
Are you all right, Jeshua?

01:16:11.370 --> 01:16:14.162
Better.

01:16:15.619 --> 01:16:17.620
All right.

01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:20.162
Let him play with the water.

01:16:32.329 --> 01:16:34.203
Close his hands.

01:16:34.537 --> 01:16:36.995
Ask him to play with the water, would be better.

01:16:37.454 --> 01:16:40.370
In the water. Ask him to immerse his feet in the water.

01:16:45.786 --> 01:16:49.953
Put it on Mine. Wash My feet.

01:16:50.495 --> 01:16:52.579
Good, good, good.

01:16:52.828 --> 01:16:54.745
Then touch My feet.

01:16:55.078 --> 01:16:57.870
Now put his hands on Mine.

01:17:17.620 --> 01:17:20.579
Good. Hallo! All right.

01:17:26.412 --> 01:17:28.661

He’s all right now.

01:17:32.329 --> 01:17:35.370
You have washed, both of you have washed.

01:19:17.619 --> 01:19:20.287
Just put more water.

01:19:23.037 --> 01:19:25.953
Pour all that, I think.

01:19:29.037 --> 01:19:31.620
And more is needed.

01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:38.245
That is better.

01:21:39.245 --> 01:21:42.412
Hundred-and-eight names.

01:21:48.828 --> 01:21:52.203
You said hundred-and-eight names you have got.

01:22:02.703 --> 01:22:05.620
Hundred-and-eight names.

01:22:29.745 --> 01:22:32.162
You showed Me thousand names you had.

01:22:32.745 --> 01:22:35.370
These are …

01:22:35.786 --> 01:22:38.911
hundred-and-eight.

01:23:17.245 --> 01:23:20.454
These are the hundred-and-eight names?

01:23:23.078 --> 01:23:26.287
Of Mahakali.

01:23:30.579 --> 01:23:33.203
Oh, take a hundred names.

01:23:37.495 --> 01:23:38.661
It starts with Shri Mata?

01:23:38.995 --> 01:23:41.661
Take out that one, all right?

01:23:49.745 --> 01:23:50.953
Sahasranama.

01:23:51.329 --> 01:23:53.995
Yes, we have Shri Lalita.

01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:05.537
This is the praise,

01:24:05.828 --> 01:24:07.995
after the Goddess killed the two rakshasas

01:24:08.370 --> 01:24:09.953
called Shumba, Nishumba.

01:24:10.370 --> 01:24:12.703
They’re all again back on the seat.

01:24:13.078 --> 01:24:16.745
So now the praise of the gods,

01:24:17.203 --> 01:24:19.037
you have to do the same praise.

01:24:19.537 --> 01:24:21.329
Now, we’ll start – you know that

01:24:21.745 --> 01:24:24.078
up to a point he will read it,

01:24:24.537 --> 01:24:27.370
and then he will tell you that

01:24:27.828 --> 01:24:30.162
you have to put it “Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu”

01:24:30.619 --> 01:24:32.995
– he’ll tell you “Buddhi” so you should put it,

01:24:33.370 --> 01:24:35.786
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu Buddhi rupena samsthita.”

01:24:36.162 --> 01:24:37.995
You know that – “Namas Tasyai namas Tasyai

01:24:38.370 --> 01:24:39.412
namas Tasyai namoh namah.”

01:26:40.287 --> 01:26:42.703
First he will say the beginning of it.

01:26:43.078 --> 01:26:45.911
This is how the gods, you see, praised the Goddess,

01:26:46.329 --> 01:26:49.495
when She killed Shumba, Nishumba. So ….

01:26:53.745 --> 01:26:56.953
The first of all you have to give the – what you call

01:26:57.245 --> 01:26:58.995
– the ghee.

01:26:59.537 --> 01:27:01.619
But there is no spoon.

01:27:02.037 --> 01:27:05.495
For ghee at least you have some spoons.

01:28:09.162 --> 01:28:11.911
Also the moon.

01:28:12.287 --> 01:28:13.953
She’s like moon.

01:28:14.329 --> 01:28:16.579
Face is like moon ….

01:28:21.162 --> 01:28:23.537
Just water.

01:28:38.579 --> 01:28:41.370
“Sarva” is the essence.

01:28:41.870 --> 01:28:44.620
She’s the one who’s the ruler of everything.

01:28:57.203 --> 01:29:03.870
Extremely gentle, and extremely harsh.

01:29:10.911 --> 01:29:13.786
We are the intelligence.

01:29:16.245 --> 01:29:18.619
She’s the intelligence in every human being.

01:29:18.995 --> 01:29:20.329
She’s expressed as intelligence,

01:29:20.620 --> 01:29:22.620
pure intelligence in every human being.

01:29:33.995 --> 01:29:35.619
So you just say “Shraddha.”

01:29:35.953 --> 01:29:37.579
And now you repeat together.

01:29:37.911 --> 01:29:40.537
You say “Shraddha” – now say.

01:31:59.120 --> 01:32:02.287
Should be sugar and then water.

01:34:42.537 --> 01:34:44.745
Unmarried girls now.

01:34:49.287 --> 01:34:51.828
Unmarried.

01:35:42.828 --> 01:35:45.619
She used to do it always in Bombay.

01:35:56.620 --> 01:35:58.620
You also do it the same way.

01:36:09.828 --> 01:36:12.120
Now.

01:36:35.454 --> 01:36:36.579
You should say,

01:36:40.245 --> 01:36:43.162
“Sakshat Shri Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi namoh namah.

01:36:43.454 --> 01:36:45.495
Shri Mata Sakshat Shri …”

01:36:45.828 --> 01:36:48.579
– what do you say?

01:36:51.412 --> 01:36:54.120
Just say, “Om twamewa sakshat Shri Mata,”

01:36:54.454 --> 01:36:55.870
that’s all – “namoh namah.”

01:36:56.162 --> 01:36:58.619
Yes, that’s all. That’s all.

01:37:03.661 --> 01:37:05.953
[Yogi: These are hundred and eight out of the thousand names

01:37:06.329 --> 01:37:10.037
of Mahadevi given in the “Shri Lalita Sahasranama.”]

01:37:48.078 --> 01:37:51.537
First is “Shri Mata.” So now say

01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:51.454
“Pataka nashini”

01:40:52.745 --> 01:40:54.786
– killer of all the sins.

01:40:55.162 --> 01:40:56.828
So that’s why I said, don’t feel guilty.

01:40:57.287 --> 01:40:59.995
She’s the killer of all the sins.

01:41:01.370 --> 01:41:04.245
Maha-pat: the greatest of –

01:41:05.329 --> 01:41:08.037
Maha-pataka nashini.

01:44:32.162 --> 01:44:35.911
“Nistula” – means “uncomparable.”

01:46:22.078 --> 01:46:24.287
You should first of all touch here.

01:46:32.454 --> 01:46:35.162
First.

01:46:56.495 --> 01:46:59.037
Go and wash your hands.

01:47:05.537 --> 01:47:09.495
Unmarried women. Unmarried.

01:49:52.037 --> 01:49:53.037
With the Para-shakti,

01:49:53.370 --> 01:49:57.203
all the work which it looks at all happens.

01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:04.078
“Yogada.”

01:50:04.786 --> 01:50:08.329
I have given you the yoga, you see, the union.

01:50:42.454 --> 01:50:45.454
“Labdhaa. Punya-labhya” – by the punyas.

01:50:45.745 --> 01:50:49.454
You see, if you have no punyas, you cannot find any.

01:50:50.537 --> 01:50:52.745
So if many people are lost, you shouldn’t worry;

01:50:53.037 --> 01:50:54.995
they have no punyas. What can you do?

01:50:55.412 --> 01:50:57.703
“Punya-labdhaa.”

01:52:11.245 --> 01:52:14.619
“Shobhana-sulabha-gati” – “Shobhana” means “gracious”,

01:52:14.995 --> 01:52:17.703
“sulabha” means “easy” and by that,

01:52:18.120 --> 01:52:20.703
“gati” … “movement.”

01:52:21.370 --> 01:52:25.037
You get to the, your realization through

01:52:25.370 --> 01:52:26.619
“Shobhana-sulabha-gati.”

01:52:26.995 --> 01:52:29.745
There is no disgraceful behavior,

01:52:30.245 --> 01:52:32.661
or it is very beautifully done,

01:52:33.203 --> 01:52:36.162
and also “sulabha” is “easy.”

01:53:40.661 --> 01:53:44.203
“Shubha-kari” – Giver of auspiciousness.

01:55:19.120 --> 01:55:24.287

One, one person.

01:56:39.619 --> 01:56:42.162
All right, all of you!

01:56:48.120 --> 01:56:50.953
All of you have to hold it in the hand.

01:56:52.661 --> 01:56:54.953
Now, hold it in your hand, all of you, here.

01:56:55.078 --> 01:56:56.786

Yes, just hold it, right hand.

01:57:01.287 --> 01:57:04.620
Hold it with the right. Here, one can hold it.

01:57:07.037 --> 01:57:10.703
Now, put it.

01:57:14.203 --> 01:57:17.037
So thank you.

01:57:41.370 --> 01:57:44.412
“Pasha-hantri, Pasha-hantri” –

01:57:47.495 --> 01:57:49.370
You see, they are under bondage.

01:57:49.745 --> 01:57:54.370
She’s the one who kills all the bondages, pash.

01:57:58.078 --> 01:58:01.454
May God bless you.

02:00:32.619 --> 02:00:35.620

02:00:46.412 --> 02:00:48.078
She mothers them.

02:00:48.412 --> 02:00:51.412
