WEBVTT

00:28.333 --> 00:31.208
May God bless you.

00:59.458 --> 01:01.959
Please be seated.

01:24.291 --> 01:27.709
(Just to record, hmm?)

01:47.169 --> 01:52.377
It’s such a pleasure to be in the ashram in San Diego.

01:53.287 --> 01:56.454
And it’s such a beautiful place,

01:57.111 --> 02:00.944
so much expressing the love of God,

02:02.287 --> 02:07.412
the Divine, the way it wants to help you at every step.

02:07.870 --> 02:09.870
If you want to have an ashram,

02:10.245 --> 02:12.329
if you want to have a proper place,

02:12.703 --> 02:15.454
you want to look after your children well,

02:15.828 --> 02:19.537
you want to do God’s work,

02:19.828 --> 02:21.661
everything is looked after,

02:22.037 --> 02:24.745
everything has to be worked out.

02:25.245 --> 02:27.619
If it is not worked out,

02:27.953 --> 02:30.412
then how will you do your work?

02:30.911 --> 02:32.911
So, it all works out.

02:33.329 --> 02:37.995
And it’s so obvious, the way we have different ashrams,

02:38.454 --> 02:40.579
such comfortable places

02:40.953 --> 02:45.661
at a very reasonable amount that we can afford,

02:46.037 --> 02:48.911
that we can live happily together.

02:49.412 --> 02:53.745
This is the abode created by love for you.

02:54.203 --> 02:56.078
So, the first thing we have to remember,

02:56.537 --> 03:00.661
that among ourselves we should have complete love.

03:03.619 --> 03:09.162
We should not trust people who try to

03:10.412 --> 03:12.162
divide us,

03:12.454 --> 03:16.287
who try to give us wrong ideas.

03:16.828 --> 03:21.203
It’s very easy to make out a person who is a Sahaja yogi

03:22.619 --> 03:23.661
from the heart.

03:23.953 --> 03:25.245
It’s very easy to make out.

03:25.579 --> 03:27.329
You have to be a little more sensitive

03:27.661 --> 03:30.120
and you’ll find out such a person very easily.

03:30.495 --> 03:34.579
Whatever may be the cunning, it can be discovered.

03:34.995 --> 03:37.245
Nobody can act against God now,

03:37.579 --> 03:41.245
because everything will be discovered and will be found out.

03:41.661 --> 03:46.745
But we have to have our attention fully

03:47.870 --> 03:50.995
on your Mother.

03:51.953 --> 03:54.953
But some people do get little more fanatic

03:55.287 --> 03:57.203
because they are so attached, doesn’t matter,

03:57.619 --> 03:58.579
you’ll come round.

03:58.828 --> 04:02.037
But is better to be fanatic than to be doubting.

04:02.454 --> 04:07.745
So those people who do things little over,

04:08.287 --> 04:11.661
should commit to a life

04:12.037 --> 04:13.953
that whatever they see,

04:14.287 --> 04:16.287
whatever they understand in Sahaja Yoga,

04:16.620 --> 04:19.412
whatever happens, they will accept it

04:19.703 --> 04:22.828
without any anxiety about it.

04:23.287 --> 04:26.619
This is the point, that we build up

04:26.870 --> 04:29.620
our images about Sahaja Yoga also.

04:29.995 --> 04:32.412
We cannot build up – it is what it is.

04:32.661 --> 04:35.203
We cannot build up our image

04:35.619 --> 04:37.745
that we think Sahaja Yoga should be like this,

04:38.120 --> 04:39.661
Sahaja Yoga should be like that – it cannot be.

04:40.078 --> 04:42.953
You cannot compromise, you just cannot compromise.

04:43.287 --> 04:45.120
It has to be what it is.

04:45.454 --> 04:48.412
It cannot be anything that you want it to be.

04:48.786 --> 04:53.579
You cannot mould it, because it is fixed long time back.

04:54.078 --> 04:56.287
Now it is what it is,

04:56.620 --> 05:01.037
and that is why it is working out so well, so efficiently.

05:01.454 --> 05:03.329
But to make it more efficient

05:03.661 --> 05:06.370
you have to accept its working.

05:06.745 --> 05:09.745
Like yesterday’s timings, you see:

05:10.245 --> 05:11.995
I knew there must be something,

05:12.370 --> 05:15.911
and the time was not yet ready.

05:16.412 --> 05:17.911
The time I spent here

05:18.245 --> 05:20.745
would have been spent raising their kundalini,

05:21.828 --> 05:23.162
unnecessarily wasted.

05:23.495 --> 05:25.579
Instead of that, five minutes I took,

05:25.828 --> 05:27.870
it took Me to give them realization.

05:28.203 --> 05:32.828
So, it’s, everything has to be understood in that light.

05:35.037 --> 05:38.037
Gradually you will start seeing the divine play,

05:38.454 --> 05:40.120
how things work out,

05:40.579 --> 05:43.120
how it helps you.

05:43.537 --> 05:47.828
But supposing God has brought

05:48.412 --> 05:50.745
something before you.

05:51.329 --> 05:55.745
Dr. Worlikar told Me a nice story about this

05:56.078 --> 05:57.162
which is very interesting,

05:57.537 --> 05:59.828
that between the Goddess of wealth

06:00.162 --> 06:04.828
and the Goddess of education there was a little conflict.

06:05.245 --> 06:09.162
You can say education or the Saraswati,

06:09.537 --> 06:12.703
which if neglected

06:13.120 --> 06:17.911
or if too much adored can make you egoistical,

06:18.329 --> 06:21.162
in the sense that if you become a person

06:21.537 --> 06:23.162
who is after learning, learning, learning,

06:23.495 --> 06:26.162
you can be thrown on the other side.

06:26.619 --> 06:32.412
So, this lady wanted to test the power of wealth.

06:32.786 --> 06:35.245
So, She said to the Laksmi that

06:35.619 --> 06:37.786
“All right, let’s see, on this person.”

06:38.120 --> 06:42.495
This person was a beggar, he needed money,

06:42.995 --> 06:44.537
and very much.

06:44.870 --> 06:50.287
So, Laksmi put lot of money in a big utensils,

06:50.537 --> 06:51.745
what we call handa,

06:52.162 --> 06:55.495
and put it in his way.

06:55.911 --> 07:00.078
This fellow was walking,

07:00.661 --> 07:03.953
so Saraswati entered into his mind.

07:04.454 --> 07:06.620
As soon as Saraswati enters into the mind

07:06.995 --> 07:10.619
he became egoistical, and he didn’t even look at that,

07:10.953 --> 07:12.162
he just walked off.

07:12.579 --> 07:14.370
That was his need, but he walked off.

07:14.828 --> 07:20.037
So it suggests one thing, that when people become egoistical,

07:20.454 --> 07:23.037
start making their own plans,

07:23.495 --> 07:27.287
start making their own suggestions and images they form,

07:27.786 --> 07:32.495
then what happens that the Divine,

07:32.828 --> 07:35.911
which is trying to supply for your need,

07:36.329 --> 07:41.078
for your wants, for your solutions, disappears.

07:42.495 --> 07:43.703
This is what happens,

07:43.953 --> 07:48.245
that we do not allow the Divine to have its play.

07:48.579 --> 07:50.828
This is not only on material level;

07:51.245 --> 07:53.537
it is true also on emotional level,

07:53.911 --> 08:00.370
it is true also on our physical level,

08:01.953 --> 08:04.162
but the best of all

08:04.454 --> 08:07.245
that it is true about spiritual level also.

08:07.619 --> 08:08.953
So we should not miss the point.

08:09.245 --> 08:13.537
Let the Divine play its role, and we should be able to see.

08:13.911 --> 08:16.412
Like Krishna has said, “Karmanyevadikaraste”

08:16.786 --> 08:18.703
– “It is our job to do the job.”

08:19.162 --> 08:22.454
Now we’ve done the puja, aarti’s done.

08:22.995 --> 08:26.412
I said, “All right, if we can do it, all right;

08:26.703 --> 08:28.619
if we cannot, I’ll go by the evening plane.”

08:29.037 --> 08:31.786
I am not bothered, whether I go by morning plane

08:32.078 --> 08:33.745
or evening plane doesn’t matter.

08:34.162 --> 08:35.619
I’m absolutely relaxed.

08:35.995 --> 08:38.412
We discussed certain important points had to be discussed,

08:38.786 --> 08:40.329
some time had to be spent;

08:40.661 --> 08:43.329
that has to be done, that’s part of our life.

08:43.703 --> 08:46.579
So I’m not anxious that I should go by one o’clock plane.

08:46.870 --> 08:48.661
All right, I’ll go by the night plane,

08:48.911 --> 08:49.870
makes no difference to Me.

08:50.203 --> 08:55.120
So just to have a very relaxed mind,

08:55.537 --> 08:58.454
to watch how things come forward.

08:58.911 --> 09:00.245
People unnecessarily –

09:19.537 --> 09:21.619
Now when we understand

09:21.870 --> 09:26.245
that the Divine is having its complete play,

09:26.579 --> 09:30.911
its own working,

09:31.370 --> 09:32.870
the whole thing is working for us,

09:33.329 --> 09:35.870
for you, the Sahaja yogis.

09:36.412 --> 09:37.911
Once you realize that,

09:38.329 --> 09:42.412
then you feel absolutely relaxed and you are in joy.

09:42.870 --> 09:44.329
But when you start,

09:44.745 --> 09:46.661
“Oh, this should have been like this,

09:47.162 --> 09:49.037
that should have been like this,”

09:49.495 --> 09:53.245
then everything is against joy.

09:54.162 --> 09:56.745
Whichever way it comes is all right.

09:57.120 --> 09:58.828
Once you develop that attitude,

09:59.162 --> 10:02.162
then the joy will be complete.

10:02.911 --> 10:04.745
I have seen in emotional life also

10:05.203 --> 10:07.329
if you people suffer too much.

10:07.786 --> 10:11.870
The reason is, for everything you start thinking.

10:12.828 --> 10:16.579
Now in India, how we get married is very simple, you see.

10:16.911 --> 10:21.120
From childhood we are taught that “You’ll be married,

10:21.579 --> 10:24.454
so you must learn how to live with your husband,”

10:24.870 --> 10:28.412
and a man is always told how to treat your wife.

10:28.786 --> 10:30.786
But they don’t know who is the wife and the husband.

10:31.162 --> 10:35.619
But the husband and wife is just a sort of a symbol.

10:36.078 --> 10:37.537
They don’t know which one it is;

10:37.870 --> 10:39.661
just could be anyone.

10:40.037 --> 10:42.953
So, once you accept her as a dharma,

10:43.329 --> 10:46.745
it comes as a surprise to you, and just enjoy.

10:47.203 --> 10:49.579
And the whole thing is built up to a point,

10:49.953 --> 10:52.620
to a moment which has to be auspicious also.

10:53.078 --> 10:55.745
Of course, they consult the horoscopes,

10:56.162 --> 10:57.037
that’s an important part,

10:57.412 --> 10:59.495
because horoscopes if you don’t consult,

10:59.828 --> 11:00.953
could be quite disastrous.

11:01.287 --> 11:02.828
So, they consult the horoscopes.

11:03.245 --> 11:05.329
And if there are so many points

11:05.661 --> 11:07.619
– they say twenty-six points is ideal

11:08.078 --> 11:11.037
– then they get married, otherwise they don’t.

11:11.537 --> 11:17.454
Now it’s not necessary that we do not meet or we meet.

11:17.828 --> 11:21.120
Sometimes the people meet, talk to each other for one year,

11:21.619 --> 11:23.745
may be that their marriages are postponed,

11:24.120 --> 11:25.120
there’s no auspicious time.

11:25.495 --> 11:27.661
They get some time to be together,

11:28.037 --> 11:29.620
but never in private;

11:30.078 --> 11:31.703
they never go into privacy.

11:32.120 --> 11:34.703
So that moment is kept as sacred moment,

11:35.162 --> 11:37.579
when you are going to meet your husband or wife

11:37.911 --> 11:39.495
– that’s a very sacred moment,

11:39.828 --> 11:42.995
so you are concentrated on that point.

11:45.828 --> 11:48.454
So suddenly it is decided.

11:48.870 --> 11:51.162
Now, you keep that moment as sacred moment.

11:51.537 --> 11:55.579
Even sometimes it happens that you get some time in between,

11:55.870 --> 11:57.619
quite a lot, after decision;

11:57.953 --> 12:01.037
could be that you have to continue

12:01.537 --> 12:03.703
as a feeling, seeing that person.

12:04.037 --> 12:06.287
But then you do not divert your attention,

12:06.620 --> 12:09.745
it’s completely concentrated effort.

12:10.245 --> 12:14.203
It clicks, because you just accept it.

12:14.911 --> 12:17.495
But here people live together for three years,

12:17.953 --> 12:19.329
then they marry and divorce.

12:19.703 --> 12:22.203
I mean I can’t understand, even if three years you live,

12:22.495 --> 12:23.953
seven years you live, ten years they live,

12:24.329 --> 12:25.245
still they do the same.

12:25.579 --> 12:28.245
So, what’s the use of knowing each other for so many years,

12:28.537 --> 12:29.412
still you divorce?

12:29.703 --> 12:31.995
But it just clicks if you understand that

12:32.329 --> 12:33.703
it’s a concentrated movement

12:34.120 --> 12:36.911
where you have everything concentrated,

12:37.370 --> 12:40.911
and you just meet the person and accept that person

12:41.287 --> 12:42.911
as your companion.

12:43.370 --> 12:47.537
Maybe one or two fail, but if you don’t think about it,

12:47.828 --> 12:48.995
it won’t fail so much.

12:49.370 --> 12:50.786
Because after marriage you start thinking,

12:51.162 --> 12:54.537
“Oh I expected this, I expected that.

12:54.911 --> 12:57.786
I thought this would be so; that’s not so.”

12:58.203 --> 13:00.786
And always trying to find fault with another,

13:01.078 --> 13:04.162
not with yourself – that’s the best part of it;

13:04.620 --> 13:07.620
not seeing that how you are adjusting to that person.

13:08.203 --> 13:10.162
Once you start thinking about marriage,

13:10.495 --> 13:13.828
marriage is finished, already done with.

13:14.911 --> 13:19.162
As a child is born to you, without thinking

13:19.661 --> 13:21.911
what sort of a child is going to come, you love the child,

13:22.287 --> 13:23.911
in the same way in the marriage

13:24.329 --> 13:28.162
you’ll have to develop that kind of a concentrated feeling.

13:28.620 --> 13:30.329
Then only marriages will be successful.

13:30.661 --> 13:33.995
But here, you see, like when you purchase something,

13:34.370 --> 13:35.870
you buy something, all right,

13:36.245 --> 13:38.370
then you think, “Oh, it was not good,

13:38.661 --> 13:40.037
I should have bought something else,

13:40.412 --> 13:42.537
would have been better,” this, that.

13:42.953 --> 13:44.786
So, you go to another thing.

13:45.203 --> 13:48.703
Things are different; things are things.

13:49.287 --> 13:51.120
Human beings are living things,

13:51.579 --> 13:53.078
they are not dead things

13:53.454 --> 13:55.370
that you can change one from another,

13:55.745 --> 13:58.703
“I could have got that one or that one.”

13:59.037 --> 14:00.953
You cannot go on like this with human beings

14:01.287 --> 14:04.245
– you’re playing with the Divine then.

14:04.995 --> 14:08.745
And this is the main point where we feel that

14:09.120 --> 14:13.329
Sahaja yogis have to learn to accept

14:13.661 --> 14:15.287
with joy, with happiness,

14:15.620 --> 14:19.245
and not to project nonsensical ideas.

14:20.703 --> 14:23.995
Then only you will find your joy will be complete.

14:24.370 --> 14:25.911
Otherwise it will not be.

14:26.329 --> 14:29.120
Then if you come, say, to the physical side:

14:29.537 --> 14:32.495
like here it is, if a woman is very thin,

14:32.828 --> 14:35.619
she wants to have legs like this, hands like this,

14:35.995 --> 14:38.828
body like this. Why?

14:39.287 --> 14:41.162
I mean, imagine everybody to be regimented

14:41.495 --> 14:43.995
into certain patterns, so much of the waist,

14:44.329 --> 14:46.370
so much of the thing – horrible it will be.

14:46.703 --> 14:48.953
I mean you’ll be tired and fed-up with that.

14:49.454 --> 14:50.828
So, you want to be like that.

14:51.245 --> 14:54.078
Now the fashion comes in that physically

14:54.412 --> 14:58.162
we should be Mr. America or whatever you may call it.

14:58.537 --> 15:01.870
So everybody is doing jogging, everybody running like mad.

15:02.329 --> 15:05.995
But why? You have your own personality, keep it up.

15:06.370 --> 15:09.786
You need certain things for your body, the way you are.

15:10.203 --> 15:12.037
Of course, if your health is not all right

15:12.454 --> 15:14.703
then you try with your chakras, cure it.

15:15.162 --> 15:17.579
But to appearances, to think that

15:17.995 --> 15:19.870
“I should look like this, I should be like that,”

15:20.203 --> 15:21.828
makes no difference at all.

15:22.329 --> 15:25.786
So again, another madness starts, so people are very unhappy.

15:26.162 --> 15:29.870
You see, you go to these very so-called elite classes

15:30.287 --> 15:33.120
where most of the men are very highly paid,

15:33.412 --> 15:35.995
educated, top class people,

15:36.329 --> 15:38.745
women are also educated, everything,

15:39.078 --> 15:40.619
and what they talk is this only:

15:40.953 --> 15:43.412
how much calories you eat, this is that.

15:43.703 --> 15:45.745
You don’t understand, what’s the matter with these people?

15:46.120 --> 15:49.786
Their level is so low.

15:50.579 --> 15:53.078
That’s a decent talk, and if they come to indecency,

15:53.370 --> 15:55.579
they can go to any level also there.

15:55.828 --> 15:58.579
So that shows that there has been no evolution

15:58.911 --> 16:00.078
in that person.

16:00.412 --> 16:02.537
They just think on those terms.

16:02.911 --> 16:04.537
And that’s how they become very serious,

16:04.828 --> 16:06.661
very seriously they discuss all this thing.

16:07.078 --> 16:10.537
You feel like laughing at them, the way they are stupid.

16:10.911 --> 16:12.619
So, all these things are regarded

16:12.911 --> 16:15.203
as so important in a country like America

16:15.537 --> 16:19.579
or any other country, shows the kind of people they have.

16:20.703 --> 16:23.287
I mean, in India nobody is so much bothered about the figure.

16:23.619 --> 16:26.828
At least in My age people never liked very thin girls,

16:27.245 --> 16:29.454
because they thought they must be very irritable,

16:29.786 --> 16:31.953
hot-tempered, all the time thinking.

16:32.370 --> 16:34.786
They never liked very thin girls I really tell you;

16:35.162 --> 16:36.412
even now My husband doesn’t like.

16:36.620 --> 16:38.579
He says, “You see, men have befooled women,

16:38.911 --> 16:41.619
and that’s why women are doing all these things.”

16:42.037 --> 16:43.203
You see, he’s a simple man,

16:43.579 --> 16:45.245
so he thinks that the men have befooled them.

16:45.661 --> 16:48.620
So, it’s like that, and then they make legs like this

16:48.953 --> 16:51.245
or teeth like this or nose like this

16:51.579 --> 16:54.911
and you take a plastic nose, put on – why?

16:55.287 --> 16:59.619
So physical also imbalances come in when we start thinking.

16:59.953 --> 17:02.911
Because when we think, we collide with another thinking,

17:03.370 --> 17:05.454
then we form a general thinking,

17:05.870 --> 17:07.828
then a general pattern is accepted.

17:08.162 --> 17:11.745
When that is accepted people say, “All right, let’s have it.”

17:12.162 --> 17:14.537
First, they used to have very tight clothes, you see,

17:14.745 --> 17:17.162
and one girl was boasting to Me that she wore

17:17.454 --> 17:19.203
it for eight days and she can’t take it out now.

17:19.537 --> 17:20.579
I said, “How, how did you manage?”

17:20.911 --> 17:22.995
She said, “This is something that you can wear

17:23.329 --> 17:25.745
and jump into the tub,

17:26.245 --> 17:28.828
and then it shrinks and you can’t take it out.

17:29.203 --> 17:30.245
You can have bath with this,

17:30.620 --> 17:32.245
you can do what you like with this.”

17:32.661 --> 17:33.703
I said, “It’s very filthy.”

17:34.120 --> 17:36.412
“No, no, you can wash it nicely and wipe it.”

17:36.786 --> 17:38.537
But I said, “Why, why do such a thing

17:38.870 --> 17:43.287
which will completely coagulate your blood inside?”

17:43.620 --> 17:44.953
Now they started suffering,

17:45.329 --> 17:47.661
so now they’re having absolutely loose clothes, you see,

17:47.953 --> 17:51.537
lanky-pankies, casual, this thing.

17:52.037 --> 17:53.703
So, they jump from one to another

17:54.037 --> 17:55.828
when you go on thinking about it,

17:56.162 --> 17:59.245
trying to devise new methods.

17:59.620 --> 18:01.245
But tradition is different.

18:01.619 --> 18:05.412
Tradition is that when people are traditional,

18:05.745 --> 18:08.287
what happens actually, those people who are sensible

18:08.619 --> 18:09.870
can only become traditional,

18:10.329 --> 18:12.870
because they understand whatever is to be discarded,

18:13.245 --> 18:14.454
whatever is not to be discarded.

18:14.828 --> 18:17.370
And they try to understand how we are going to ascend.

18:17.786 --> 18:19.537
Not by taking one side,

18:19.953 --> 18:21.786
but on both the sides we must weigh

18:22.245 --> 18:24.620
and balance ourselves and then go ahead.

18:24.870 --> 18:26.995
And whatever is to be discarded to be discarded,

18:27.412 --> 18:30.828
whatever is to be good is to be taken up.

18:31.287 --> 18:34.911
Like what you call the trial and error business.

18:35.287 --> 18:37.745
You see, you make the error – all right, give it up;

18:38.203 --> 18:40.162
then take another – all right, give it up.

18:40.579 --> 18:43.412
Whatever is good, you keep it and go on with it,

18:43.786 --> 18:45.786
and that’s how you build up a proper tradition

18:46.203 --> 18:47.995
for other people to follow.

18:48.454 --> 18:51.329
But those who think of the new things all the time,

18:51.620 --> 18:53.828
they want to have something new all the time,

18:54.370 --> 18:56.078
then they are very much mistaken,

18:56.495 --> 18:59.619
that when they do like this what we call is a tomfoolery.

18:59.995 --> 19:02.287
With the new things they can land themselves

19:02.703 --> 19:05.454
into terrible messes, and that’s what exactly has happened

19:05.870 --> 19:08.454
to most of the Western countries,

19:08.786 --> 19:10.162
that everything new they try.

19:10.537 --> 19:13.911
Now the new craze is cocaine – all right, have cocaine.

19:14.412 --> 19:16.287
I mean, even I would not be surprised

19:16.661 --> 19:18.329
if Prince Philip takes to such a thing

19:18.703 --> 19:20.203
or somebody takes to thing like that.

19:20.619 --> 19:22.287
I mean, everybody wants to try new,

19:22.703 --> 19:27.203
and if you say you cannot try then they say, “Why, why not?”

19:29.162 --> 19:31.995
This is a very big problem with the Western mind.

19:32.412 --> 19:34.245
So, you all people should also understand,

19:34.620 --> 19:38.037
don’t try new things in Sahaja Yoga.

19:40.078 --> 19:43.454
Sahaja Yoga is a traditionally built thing.

19:43.870 --> 19:47.370
Don’t try anything new in Sahaja Yoga.

19:47.828 --> 19:50.412
Whatever we have is more than sufficient,

19:50.828 --> 19:51.911
you don’t try anything new.

19:52.287 --> 19:55.037
People who tried new things have jumped into problems,

19:55.495 --> 19:58.786
so do not try something new.

19:59.412 --> 20:02.911
Like somebody said that nowadays, you see,

20:03.454 --> 20:05.828
I heard in London we had some people

20:06.203 --> 20:08.037
who started giving lectures

20:08.579 --> 20:12.579
and giving new methods of Sahaja Yoga, suddenly.

20:12.995 --> 20:14.037
And they all went mad.

20:14.495 --> 20:16.619
I mean, their vibrations were crazy,

20:16.953 --> 20:18.495
I didn’t know what to do with them.

20:18.870 --> 20:19.870
I was quite surprised.

20:20.203 --> 20:22.495
I said, “Why did you try a new method like that?

20:22.786 --> 20:25.078
What was the need to try a new method?”

20:25.495 --> 20:28.661
“Oh,” they said, “Well we thought, better try this one.”

20:29.078 --> 20:30.870
But I said, “I have already told you all the methods.

20:31.203 --> 20:32.745
Have you tried, have you perfected yourself?

20:33.162 --> 20:35.203
Better try those which I’ve told you,

20:35.661 --> 20:39.329
and then you can ask Me and then start something new.

20:39.703 --> 20:41.703
But you must understand what you are doing.”

20:42.120 --> 20:45.078
And also, I’ve seen mediocre Sahaja yogis always do like that,

20:45.495 --> 20:49.037
try some new method. And they’ll come out with this thing,

20:49.412 --> 20:52.245
“Now I’ll tell you how to circulate your breath.”

20:52.620 --> 20:55.162
Why to circulate your breath?

20:55.537 --> 20:56.953
Suddenly they find out a new method.

20:57.287 --> 21:00.203
Is a common thing, but these are sometimes could be

21:00.537 --> 21:03.037
very sinister people also, so be careful.

21:03.495 --> 21:05.620
There is no need to try new methods.

21:05.911 --> 21:08.454
Now you have jumped on to that awareness

21:08.786 --> 21:10.579
where you have to just be steady.

21:10.953 --> 21:13.329
So, don’t try at this point something new.

21:13.786 --> 21:17.370
Just steady yourself, steady yourself in balance

21:17.786 --> 21:20.412
– that’s very important.

21:20.870 --> 21:23.454
Second point is that everyone

21:23.745 --> 21:26.287
should be knowledgeable in Sahaja Yoga.

21:26.703 --> 21:29.329
But some people are so funnily knowledgeable

21:29.703 --> 21:31.911
that I’m sometimes surprised.

21:32.412 --> 21:35.537
Like there was a fellow who was homosexual

21:35.828 --> 21:37.203
or nonsensical thing,

21:37.620 --> 21:39.329
and then he told some people that

21:39.661 --> 21:42.620
“Yes, you see, Mother says it’s all right once in a while.”

21:43.078 --> 21:46.245
I never said so. I can never say such a thing.

21:46.745 --> 21:49.370
Then somebody said, “Drinking – all right, Mother said.”

21:49.745 --> 21:52.412
How could I say? There’s no compromise.

21:52.786 --> 21:56.620
Somebody says, “It’s all right, you can do some business.”

21:57.120 --> 21:58.370
I never said so.

21:58.786 --> 22:00.786
No, you cannot do, these things are not,

22:01.203 --> 22:02.245
they are not meant for you.

22:02.661 --> 22:05.078
You don’t have to do it at all. Right?

22:05.620 --> 22:07.953
So, anybody who comes out with such ideas,

22:08.329 --> 22:09.786
you tell them “nothing of the kind.”

22:10.287 --> 22:11.329
There’s nothing like that,

22:11.703 --> 22:14.412
there’s no compromise in Sahaja Yoga, no compromise.

22:14.828 --> 22:16.412
Whatever methods we have learned,

22:16.828 --> 22:19.245
let us practice them to establish ourselves

22:19.619 --> 22:20.454
and establish others.

22:20.786 --> 22:23.579
You must keep to your maryadas, to your limits.

22:24.037 --> 22:26.162
Do not try to fly.

22:26.620 --> 22:29.120
Some people think that they are greater Sahaja yogis

22:29.537 --> 22:31.412
and they will do this and they will do that.

22:31.745 --> 22:33.495
Then remember, that is wrong.

22:33.911 --> 22:35.786
You have to humble down yourself,

22:36.245 --> 22:38.745
and remember that when you humble down

22:39.203 --> 22:41.828
you will realize that only the humble people

22:42.203 --> 22:44.162
are steady people.

22:46.911 --> 22:49.162
So, there should be complete humility.

22:49.661 --> 22:52.828
Try to acquire more knowledge about Sahaja Yoga.

22:53.329 --> 22:54.620
There are so many ways.

22:55.120 --> 22:57.287
I have got all My tapes done already,

22:57.661 --> 23:01.412
we have got all these Sahaja Yoga books out now

23:01.786 --> 23:03.870
and also your “Nirmala Yoga” is there

23:04.287 --> 23:07.412
– so many ways by which you can understand Sahaja Yoga.

23:07.703 --> 23:10.037
If you don’t understand, you can ask each other,

23:10.454 --> 23:13.661
try to analyse it the way you want to understand,

23:14.162 --> 23:17.120
that what Mother is saying, is this is what She’s saying.

23:17.537 --> 23:20.495
Because My lectures are in very, very simple language.

23:20.870 --> 23:23.370
I use extremely simple language,

23:23.786 --> 23:27.661
avoiding all literary language as far as possible of course;

23:28.037 --> 23:31.162
sometimes I do have to use difficult words, but normally.

23:31.619 --> 23:35.828
So, but beyond that is a very subtle knowledge flowing.

23:36.329 --> 23:38.995
So, to understand that sometimes may be difficult,

23:39.412 --> 23:43.037
you may try to sort of construct something else out of it,

23:43.495 --> 23:45.619
may try to sort of interpret something.

23:45.995 --> 23:47.245
If there’s any such problem,

23:47.619 --> 23:49.786
better consult somebody whom you think

23:50.245 --> 23:52.078
is capable of advising you.

23:52.495 --> 23:54.329
But you must accept that.

23:54.703 --> 23:56.870
You should not put forward your viewpoint,

23:57.287 --> 23:58.870
and it would be very wrong.

23:59.287 --> 24:02.995
Then you will be sort of like a derailed train

24:03.495 --> 24:05.370
which goes out of track.

24:05.828 --> 24:07.579
We have a track in Sahaja Yoga,

24:07.911 --> 24:09.661
you must know that, whether you like it or not.

24:10.120 --> 24:13.495
It’s no question of freedom, but the track to ascend.

24:13.911 --> 24:15.537
You cannot get out of that track.

24:15.953 --> 24:18.745
If you think you can just move about a little bit,

24:19.287 --> 24:22.245
have a nice time with all filth

24:22.661 --> 24:25.495
and then come back to Sahaja Yoga, you won’t be acceptable.

24:25.953 --> 24:28.495
If you do that then I’ll have to work hard

24:28.911 --> 24:31.078
to cleanse you out, do this, do that.

24:31.579 --> 24:34.454
But to keep yourself clean you’d better keep to your tracks

24:34.911 --> 24:36.120
and don’t get out of it.

24:36.579 --> 24:41.745
Don’t try to find out new things of doing something

24:42.162 --> 24:44.203
which is not necessary; why do it?

24:44.620 --> 24:50.162
I mean, simple thing is to understand it’s a waste of energy.

24:50.745 --> 24:52.203
I’ve already found it for you,

24:52.495 --> 24:53.329
why do you want to do it again?

24:53.703 --> 24:55.120
Like this kind of a blouse

24:55.495 --> 24:58.329
I’ve been wearing now for the last, I think,

24:58.661 --> 25:01.995
fifty years or maybe more, this type of a blouse.

25:02.454 --> 25:05.495
Now My tailor knows that I wear this blouse, this is this,

25:05.786 --> 25:07.745
this is this. He has got My measurements.

25:08.120 --> 25:09.870
So, I have to just tell him that

25:10.245 --> 25:12.661
“You get Me a cloth of this kind,

25:13.162 --> 25:15.120
and just make a blouse for Me.” He makes it.

25:15.619 --> 25:17.120
For the last so many years I have had,

25:17.537 --> 25:20.537
about twenty-five years, I had one tailor who does My job.

25:20.953 --> 25:22.870
He has no headache, I have no headache, no problem.

25:23.287 --> 25:25.786
Every day if I have to change this pattern,

25:26.329 --> 25:28.703
make a new sleeve and a new type of a blouse,

25:29.078 --> 25:31.870
I’ll have a headache, I mean, I tell you.

25:32.412 --> 25:34.287
So why, why do that? What’s the use?

25:34.661 --> 25:37.786
Who sees, who is affected by that?

25:38.162 --> 25:43.120
So unnecessarily we are wasting our energy on these things.

25:43.619 --> 25:45.703
But I don’t say that you should be regimented,

25:46.078 --> 25:49.703
by any means, but what I mean that wherever

25:50.037 --> 25:52.203
you can save your energy of thinking, you should do it.

25:52.537 --> 25:55.287
For small, small things there’s no need to have varieties,

25:55.661 --> 25:58.120
and this country as I’ve told you before

25:58.579 --> 26:00.203
hat every tap has to be different,

26:00.620 --> 26:02.037
every handle is to be different,

26:02.495 --> 26:05.703
every tile has to be different – what is the need?

26:06.162 --> 26:08.786
What has to be different is artistic things.

26:09.329 --> 26:12.245
Sari has to be different because it is artistic.

26:12.661 --> 26:14.412
But what is in a stitching of a blouse,

26:14.786 --> 26:15.870
there’s no art in it involved.

26:16.287 --> 26:18.745
So, whatever is artistic can be different,

26:19.203 --> 26:21.037
but whatever is mundane need not be.

26:21.495 --> 26:23.495
In the machinery why should you have

26:23.870 --> 26:25.078
different types of things, you’ll go mad.

26:25.537 --> 26:27.786
You go to a shop, there’s twenty types of things,

26:28.203 --> 26:30.953
you don’t which one to buy, all made by machine only.

26:31.370 --> 26:32.661
This is good, that is good.

26:33.078 --> 26:35.245
Then another fellow he comes, he says, “Not good.”

26:35.620 --> 26:37.120
Then you feel hurt.

26:37.495 --> 26:41.162
But if you have for mundane things, few things is better,

26:41.579 --> 26:45.245
that you do not take too many headaches upon yourself.

26:45.620 --> 26:48.162
So best thing to avoid all these problems

26:48.537 --> 26:50.870
is to use your new awareness of vibrations.

26:51.245 --> 26:52.828
So, you save your energies.

26:53.245 --> 26:54.995
Your energies must be saved,

26:55.537 --> 26:58.911
and they can be saved if you do not pay attention to things

26:59.329 --> 27:03.203
which are not your style, where you don’t have to go.

27:03.579 --> 27:06.162
Just see vibrations. If I go for shopping

27:06.619 --> 27:08.828
– now I go shopping for various reasons, as you know.

27:09.287 --> 27:11.579
One is to put My vibrations there;

27:11.953 --> 27:15.745
another is to put also vibrations on the people

27:16.120 --> 27:17.370
who are in the market.

27:17.703 --> 27:19.537
Thirdly is to look at all the things,

27:19.870 --> 27:21.619
so My vibrations go onto them.

27:22.037 --> 27:24.828
Fourthly, to buy something to be given to others.

27:25.329 --> 27:28.661
But if I like something it is only through vibrations

27:29.037 --> 27:31.953
and I buy it somehow,

27:33.454 --> 27:35.329
because it is to be given to someone

27:35.786 --> 27:37.703
or something has to be done later.

27:38.120 --> 27:41.745
I just buy it, keep it, it comes very handy.

27:43.329 --> 27:45.619
That is how your attitude should be.

27:46.037 --> 27:48.287
But on the contrary if you just go on,

27:48.703 --> 27:51.287
“I like this, I don’t like it,” about your wife,

27:51.703 --> 27:55.245
about your jobs, your everything, you’ll be uncertain.

27:55.619 --> 27:56.620
These days in America

27:56.995 --> 27:59.537
people are very funny about their jobs also.

27:59.911 --> 28:01.120
I have to touch these points,

28:01.495 --> 28:02.619
because you’ll face this problem.

28:02.995 --> 28:04.828
Today they’re doing some job, “I don’t like it,

28:05.245 --> 28:06.870
I don’t like my boss” – another job.

28:07.370 --> 28:09.078
Then they’ll go to another job, they change it.

28:09.495 --> 28:10.870
Then third job, change it.

28:11.203 --> 28:13.245
They like to change, you know, all the time

28:13.620 --> 28:15.454
– it’s maddening, I tell you.

28:15.828 --> 28:17.620
Change their wives, change their house,

28:17.995 --> 28:20.579
change everything. Why?

28:20.995 --> 28:24.870
Have only one wife, is better.

28:25.329 --> 28:28.454
At the most have two jobs in life, is better.

28:28.953 --> 28:33.245
And at the most change three residences, is better.

28:33.620 --> 28:35.454
But more than that is a headache.

28:35.786 --> 28:37.745
I mean, to Me, I have changed forty houses

28:38.078 --> 28:41.537
because of My husband’s temperament.

28:43.579 --> 28:47.911
But I’m different, because I’m absolutely a person

28:48.287 --> 28:50.870
who is not bothered whatever change comes.

28:51.329 --> 28:53.620
But you are not the same, so don’t waste your energy.

28:54.078 --> 28:56.037
So, this is very important to understand,

28:56.537 --> 29:00.287
not to go on changing jobs, is very important.

29:00.995 --> 29:03.078
Because that is also a craze, I tell you.

29:03.619 --> 29:05.579
I’ll tell you about Douglas. He used to do that.

29:05.995 --> 29:07.620
Every time he had financial problem

29:08.037 --> 29:12.037
because he was changing jobs. So, one day I told him off.

29:12.454 --> 29:14.703
I said, “Douglas, if you change this job”

29:15.037 --> 29:16.579
– because I saw the vibrations are all right

29:17.078 --> 29:18.203
– “if you change this job,

29:18.619 --> 29:20.162
that you are not going to see Me again.”

29:20.620 --> 29:24.120
And now today he has got a house, he’s got a car,

29:24.537 --> 29:28.329
he’s got money in the bank, he’s doing well.

29:31.619 --> 29:34.245
So that also is a headache for Me,

29:34.620 --> 29:38.828
“Mother, I have no job, I have no money. What am I to do?”

29:39.370 --> 29:42.995
Every time there are people who come to India, they say,

29:43.454 --> 29:45.703
“Mother, I have no money, I’m sorry I couldn’t pay You.”

29:46.120 --> 29:47.828
All right, doesn’t matter.

29:48.245 --> 29:51.203
There are at least, this last time also there were five people.

29:51.620 --> 29:53.995
But before that I think there were about twenty people.

29:54.495 --> 29:56.329
So, every time it happens like this.

29:56.786 --> 29:59.703
So now we must understand, we must have proper jobs.

30:00.078 --> 30:01.661
We have to be respectable people.

30:02.203 --> 30:03.828
We must have proper qualifications,

30:04.287 --> 30:06.495
if possible, better to get some qualifications.

30:06.911 --> 30:08.745
You are all very intelligent people

30:09.245 --> 30:11.245
and you can get your qualifications.

30:11.703 --> 30:14.287
You should have a respectability in the society.

30:14.703 --> 30:16.661
Otherwise they’ll think that this Mother

30:17.078 --> 30:20.162
is the Mother of all the beggars.

30:22.078 --> 30:25.745
So steady yourself in your jobs, in your houses.

30:26.245 --> 30:30.620
To steady yourself you must learn not to change.

30:35.661 --> 30:40.370
The change makes you unsteady – do you see the point?

30:40.828 --> 30:42.245
So, there is no question of changing.

30:42.619 --> 30:44.703
“I’m going to go through it.”

30:45.245 --> 30:49.120
Then if it is necessary, if it is not workable,

30:49.579 --> 30:51.537
then one can change.

30:51.953 --> 30:54.120
It applies to everything.

30:54.661 --> 30:58.828
Now, guru-shopping is nothing but change.

30:59.329 --> 31:02.703
The more gurus you have, the greater headache I have.

31:03.162 --> 31:05.537
If you have only one guru, say horrible one,

31:05.953 --> 31:07.495
it’s all right, easy to clear you out.

31:07.911 --> 31:10.454
But if you have been to twenty, whatever am I to do?

31:10.911 --> 31:13.287
One fellow who has been to gurus so much

31:13.661 --> 31:15.454
that I couldn’t understand his personality.

31:15.911 --> 31:17.454
I said, “What’s the matter with this?”

31:17.828 --> 31:20.454
Every problem, you name it and it’s there.

31:20.953 --> 31:22.329
I said, “What sort of a fellow is this?”

31:22.661 --> 31:23.745
So, I said, “All right, write it down

31:24.162 --> 31:25.412
all the names of all the gurus you have been to.”

31:25.786 --> 31:29.953
He wrote three foolscap papers on both the sides.

31:30.661 --> 31:32.745
I said, “I’m sorry, sir, I can’t help you.”

31:33.203 --> 31:34.495
He said, “Mother, You have to,

31:34.828 --> 31:36.579
because there’s a very immediate problem.”

31:36.953 --> 31:38.745
I said, “What is the immediate problem?”

31:39.203 --> 31:41.370
“That now I am becoming a woman.”

31:41.828 --> 31:44.620
I said, “Hah?”

31:45.078 --> 31:48.537
“The doctors have said that now I’m becoming a woman.”

31:49.245 --> 31:51.579
I said, “That’s really an immediate problem.”

31:51.995 --> 31:55.703
I said, “That much I can stop, but you need lot of cleansing.”

31:56.287 --> 31:58.329
And he used to sometimes look like Hanumana,

31:58.703 --> 32:00.203
sometimes he looks like a madman,

32:00.619 --> 32:01.745
he used to look like anything,

32:02.120 --> 32:04.537
because so many gurus in him were working it out.

32:04.953 --> 32:08.620
Ultimately that he got himself cleansed out

32:08.995 --> 32:10.870
and his problem was solved,

32:11.329 --> 32:13.412
but even now I would not say that he is a Sahaja yogi;

32:13.745 --> 32:16.329
though he’s very learned, knows all about Sanskrit

32:16.619 --> 32:17.703
because he has been to so many gurus,

32:18.037 --> 32:21.287
every type of guru he has been.

32:21.870 --> 32:25.620
This has come by change – “what’s wrong?”

32:26.495 --> 32:30.495
So, once you come to Sahaja Yoga, then stop.

32:31.203 --> 32:34.037
Stop everything else.

32:34.579 --> 32:37.620
Second point that I stressed was this,

32:38.162 --> 32:40.661
that in Sahaja Yoga once you come,

32:41.162 --> 32:43.995
focus yourself to Me and Sahaja Yoga first,

32:44.495 --> 32:45.412
and then other things.

32:45.786 --> 32:47.287
Like Christians when they come to Sahaja Yoga,

32:47.703 --> 32:49.745
they can’t accept Ganesh.

32:50.287 --> 32:54.203
Indians who come to Sahaja Yoga cannot accept Christ.

32:54.620 --> 32:58.454
Muslims who come to Sahaja Yoga cannot take to puja.

32:58.995 --> 33:01.495
Everybody is coming with a load behind them.

33:01.911 --> 33:05.037
So better come and put them at My feet, finished.

33:05.495 --> 33:08.245
Now you see them through My prism,

33:08.745 --> 33:12.786
through Me – is better to understand that way.

33:13.245 --> 33:15.620
And those who have understood Me that way,

33:16.162 --> 33:19.037
just understand Sahaja Yoga in a perfect manner.

33:19.495 --> 33:22.078
There’s no fanaticism of the past,

33:22.537 --> 33:24.245
neither of Sahaja Yoga either.

33:24.619 --> 33:27.911
So, they understand that this is all the same as Mother is,

33:28.329 --> 33:30.786
and there’s nothing to be sticking

33:31.203 --> 33:32.828
onto one thing or to another.

33:33.329 --> 33:36.329
But it doesn’t mean that if you call Me

33:36.703 --> 33:39.287
the Goddess Kali you are insulting Me,

33:39.703 --> 33:42.995
or if you call Me Mataji Nirmala Devi you’re elevating Me

33:43.412 --> 33:45.495
– it’s all there.

33:45.995 --> 33:48.995
So one has to understand that all this

33:49.745 --> 33:52.786
is related to our own compartments.

33:53.245 --> 33:56.412
God has no compartments like that.

33:57.162 --> 33:59.828
It is not that America exists in His mind,

34:00.329 --> 34:02.619
or it is not that anything exists in mind.

34:03.078 --> 34:06.370
Do we exist like “now I am only my Vishuddhi”

34:06.828 --> 34:07.953
– do we exist like that?

34:08.370 --> 34:10.495
Or “I’m only my nose” – do we?

34:10.953 --> 34:12.537
We exist as the whole body.

34:13.037 --> 34:17.162
So, God exists – though He has a nose, He has His ears, say,

34:17.620 --> 34:19.995
everything is there; but He exists as God.

34:20.454 --> 34:22.661
He doesn’t exist like a nose, separate,

34:23.162 --> 34:25.037
doesn’t exist like only America separate,

34:25.454 --> 34:27.995
but He’s existing as the whole,

34:28.495 --> 34:33.703
everything related to the whole.

34:34.537 --> 34:37.037
And when such a thing happens to us

34:37.495 --> 34:40.661
that now we are related to the whole, the Primordial Being,

34:41.203 --> 34:42.911
we should not relate ourselves

34:43.329 --> 34:44.537
to something that will localize us

34:44.995 --> 34:47.329
because of our conditionings.

34:47.870 --> 34:49.412
No localization should be there,

34:49.661 --> 34:51.537
we should be in circulation.

34:52.037 --> 34:55.162
I find it difficult for people who have been Catholics

34:55.619 --> 34:59.620
to worship Shri Ganesh with the same respect,

35:00.120 --> 35:01.203
because they are conditioned.

35:01.620 --> 35:03.370
So, try to leave it for a while, Christ,

35:03.745 --> 35:05.037
completely leave Him alone.

35:05.579 --> 35:08.953
Come to Sahaja Yoga, then you’ll see Him in proper light.

35:09.495 --> 35:11.245
Because this is the problem is,

35:11.703 --> 35:16.995
that unless and until you come inside and see for yourself

35:17.370 --> 35:19.661
that all roads have come to this one thing,

35:20.203 --> 35:22.495
so they are just the same, there’s no difference at all.

35:22.911 --> 35:24.329
First come inside.

35:24.620 --> 35:26.412
Give up everything, come inside.

35:26.786 --> 35:29.078
Then you will know that it’s all the same.

35:29.579 --> 35:31.287
And this is very important,

35:31.745 --> 35:33.953
and once you see that,

35:34.412 --> 35:37.661
it’s such a beautiful thing that you have no complications

35:38.162 --> 35:41.870
of any kind, belonging to any particular cult

35:42.370 --> 35:44.745
or particular guru or a particular thing.

35:45.203 --> 35:49.037
Even so-called religions are like cults if you see to it,

35:49.370 --> 35:51.245
they are like cults, they have conditionings.

35:51.661 --> 35:53.703
They have not given you anything but conditioning

35:54.037 --> 35:55.203
and illusions.

35:55.579 --> 35:56.786
So, we are not to live with illusions,

35:57.162 --> 35:58.245
we have to live with reality.

35:58.619 --> 36:02.412
And the reality is that, that all these essences are one,

36:02.870 --> 36:04.953
and we have to be inside them

36:05.412 --> 36:09.120
so that we can see them, all of them as one.

36:09.620 --> 36:13.454
This is also very important thing in country like America,

36:13.786 --> 36:16.911
I feel, because there are such diverse ideas,

36:17.329 --> 36:20.703
such diverse ideas that I, I’m surprised at them.

36:21.120 --> 36:23.162
Everything you name it is in America.

36:23.579 --> 36:26.245
The other day I developed one thing called Mormon,

36:26.786 --> 36:29.870
Mormon or something. Mormon.

36:30.412 --> 36:32.120
Name it and it’s in America.

36:32.495 --> 36:36.370
I don’t know how all the varieties have gathered here.

36:36.786 --> 36:39.828
Every sort of a guru, I mean, you discover them here.

36:40.162 --> 36:41.454
I had never heard of so many names.

36:41.828 --> 36:44.329
Whenever I come, I’d find a new guru coming up.

36:44.745 --> 36:48.203
Why America is the place where all these prosper like this,

36:48.537 --> 36:49.745
like mushrooms, you see?

36:50.162 --> 36:52.953
A mushroom is growing, that is – is it a rottening thing?

36:53.412 --> 36:56.287
Only mushroom grows as fungus.

36:56.911 --> 37:01.412
Is it rottening, this country? What’s happening? Why?

37:01.953 --> 37:04.245
It is the mind of human beings.

37:04.745 --> 37:08.412
The mind of human beings here always wants a new thing,

37:08.786 --> 37:11.203
and that’s why a supply comes.

37:11.661 --> 37:13.745
As a result of that they become unsteady.

37:14.245 --> 37:17.537
So, the main problem of American character

37:17.995 --> 37:20.454
is that they are very unsteady people.

37:22.412 --> 37:24.870
You ask them, “How are you?” They also say ….

37:25.703 --> 37:26.703
Understand whatever you like.

37:27.120 --> 37:30.162
They’ll never say “How are you?” ….

37:31.203 --> 37:32.579
What do you understand with that?

37:32.911 --> 37:35.037
I mean, an Indian person can’t understand.

37:35.537 --> 37:37.537
If somebody says like that, an Indian, you see,

37:37.870 --> 37:38.703
if you ask him, “How are you?”

37:39.120 --> 37:42.412
and he says like this, they’ll say, “Are you mad?”

37:45.786 --> 37:48.537
Then if you ask them, “Do you understand this?”

37:48.911 --> 37:51.120
“I’m confused.”

37:51.620 --> 37:53.078
An Indian will never say such a thing,

37:53.454 --> 37:55.412
“I’m confused.” He’s cocksure.

37:55.870 --> 37:57.995
“I’m confused” means, are you a lunatic or what?

37:58.495 --> 38:02.454
Why are you confused? Something wrong with your brain?

38:04.078 --> 38:06.078
So, all these ideas, you see,

38:06.619 --> 38:09.203
are tending towards our unsteadiness,

38:09.661 --> 38:11.911
frivolousness, superficiality.

38:12.412 --> 38:15.287
You are really bombarded by superficiality,

38:15.786 --> 38:17.412
bombarded, I can see that.

38:17.870 --> 38:20.786
Absolutely from everywhere, you see, the media, this, that:

38:21.162 --> 38:22.786
it’s nothing but superficial.

38:23.203 --> 38:26.828
It really kills the inner germ in the human being.

38:27.329 --> 38:28.454
And you want to live with it,

38:28.870 --> 38:31.162
then you want to think on those lines,

38:32.037 --> 38:35.454
and really you lose yourself, all contact with yourself is lost.

38:35.745 --> 38:38.203
Under all these circumstances one has to know

38:38.537 --> 38:40.162
one beautiful fact,

38:40.579 --> 38:44.037
that so many seekers are born in this country.

38:44.454 --> 38:48.454
It’s America which I visited the first.

38:49.703 --> 38:52.745
And I’m sure San Diego is the place where it will start,

38:53.078 --> 38:55.703
I have a feeling.

38:56.370 --> 38:58.911
[Marathi]

39:01.995 --> 39:04.412
So this is a place very important, and I’m nice,

39:04.745 --> 39:07.703
I’m happy that you have arranged this wonderful puja,

39:08.120 --> 39:09.619
and we should do this puja.

39:10.037 --> 39:15.078
And I am sure by this we will have a time,

39:15.661 --> 39:19.245
especially good time coming

39:19.786 --> 39:25.370
where we’ll have on one side American evolution,

39:25.786 --> 39:28.203
on the other side, Mexican.

39:28.661 --> 39:31.579
This we can work out from San Diego.

39:31.995 --> 39:35.495
It’s a beautiful day that you have asked for this puja.

39:35.953 --> 39:37.454
I’m very happy about it.

39:37.870 --> 39:39.703
Today is the day of the Goddess,

39:40.120 --> 39:44.828
[Marathi] – Thrayodashi.

39:48.786 --> 39:51.745
Thrayodashi is the best, thirteenth day.

39:52.245 --> 39:57.162
[Marathi]

40:09.287 --> 40:13.120
See the vibrations, you don’t need any puja!

40:19.703 --> 40:22.370
There’s no need to have a puja, really, it is so much today.

40:22.745 --> 40:23.995
So today is a great day,

40:24.329 --> 40:26.579
and I’m happy he’s asked for this puja here.

40:27.120 --> 40:31.703
So, now to begin with ….

40:32.245 --> 40:35.370
Now if you have any problems, any questions,

40:35.786 --> 40:37.911
you must let Me know.

40:38.454 --> 40:40.370
One thing, a Sahaja yogi should not be

40:40.703 --> 40:43.911
a serious person, that’s one thing.

40:45.537 --> 40:48.203
That doesn’t behove a Sahaja yogi to be serious.

40:48.703 --> 40:51.120
You should be smiling, laughing, enjoying.

40:51.579 --> 40:54.078
If he’s a serious person then he’s not a Sahaja yogi.

40:54.495 --> 40:56.745
I can’t keep serious for more than five minutes,

40:57.078 --> 40:58.412
at the most five minutes.

40:58.786 --> 41:01.620
Even if I have to scold somebody, I prepare Myself,

41:02.078 --> 41:04.454
then I come down and I shout,

41:04.828 --> 41:07.495
and then after five minutes if I don’t run away

41:07.995 --> 41:09.786
then you’ll find Me again laughing.

41:10.287 --> 41:12.579
Can’t – it’s all a joke!

41:17.911 --> 41:21.037
So, nobody should be serious, that’s one thing.

41:21.495 --> 41:22.619
Nobody should be serious.

41:22.953 --> 41:24.911
You should be always smiling and happy people,

41:25.370 --> 41:27.828
because there is joy within you. What is there?

41:28.287 --> 41:33.078
Only by thinking “I’m miserable, I’m miserable,” you see

41:34.745 --> 41:36.579
– that’s French style!

41:37.037 --> 41:39.329
French, you know, when I went there first time, they told Me,

41:39.703 --> 41:45.412
“Mother, You look too happy” – for French.

41:45.995 --> 41:47.037
So, I said, “What should I do?”

41:47.454 --> 41:49.037
Said, “Do You see, they are all very,

41:49.412 --> 41:51.703
they think they are very Misérables people, this, that.”

41:52.245 --> 41:53.953
So, I said, “All right.” So I went and said,

41:54.287 --> 41:56.120
“Now see, you are all les Misérables”

41:56.579 --> 41:59.370
– you know Victor Hugo has written this “Les Misérables”

41:59.786 --> 42:01.745
– so I said, “All right, you les miserables.

42:02.120 --> 42:04.454
Now I am a person who is not miserable at all.

42:04.911 --> 42:07.619
And you will be miserable in any case if you have,

42:08.037 --> 42:12.454
every third house you have a pub,

42:12.870 --> 42:15.162
every tenth house you have a prostitute,

42:15.703 --> 42:19.037
so what will happen? I mean, you are in for it.”

42:19.745 --> 42:20.745
That’s what it is.

42:21.162 --> 42:23.703
And even Yogi Mahajan told Me that

42:24.245 --> 42:27.203
“Mother, we want Your photograph which is very serious,

42:27.537 --> 42:28.870
it is hard to get one,

42:29.329 --> 42:32.620
and we must put a face which is very serious.”

42:33.162 --> 42:35.620
And ultimately, he ended up with a photograph

42:36.120 --> 42:37.537
which was horrid.

42:38.037 --> 42:40.661
When he told Me, “It’s a very nice photograph,

42:41.078 --> 42:44.329
You look so serene,” this, that and all the descriptions.

42:44.661 --> 42:47.495
When I saw the photograph I said, “It’s horrid!”

42:48.037 --> 42:49.661
He said, “Really?”

42:50.037 --> 42:52.620
I said, “All right, let Me tell you who has done this.”

42:53.037 --> 42:56.370
He said, “Who?” I told him the name and he was shocked.

42:56.828 --> 42:59.245
I said, “That’s the lady who has given you,

42:59.620 --> 43:01.412
and you know where she is today.”

43:01.911 --> 43:05.786
Was shocked how I told the name “Jane.”

43:09.037 --> 43:12.037
I said, “This is the photograph you are sending to Americans.”

43:12.454 --> 43:15.287
But I know Americans will be attracted by that photograph,

43:15.579 --> 43:18.579
because they are miserable themselves, you see.

43:19.037 --> 43:21.329
But such people who are attracted

43:21.661 --> 43:24.412
to that kind of a photograph will drop out in no time,

43:24.870 --> 43:28.329
they will not stick on – you don’t understand that point.

43:28.828 --> 43:30.370
They are not the type who’ll stick on.

43:30.661 --> 43:32.162
Like in Scotland, I went there

43:32.579 --> 43:35.620
and there was a photograph I saw, and I got a shock.

43:36.078 --> 43:38.828
We had gone to a restaurant where we were to have our food,

43:39.162 --> 43:41.537
and I saw My photograph and I said, “Who has done this one?”

43:41.911 --> 43:44.287
They said, “This is the copy of one of the Australian ones.”

43:44.703 --> 43:47.287
I said, “But who has done it?

43:47.786 --> 43:50.579
Because this is not good – very bad.”

43:51.120 --> 43:56.412
So, they said, “This is done by someone, suddenly.”

43:56.786 --> 43:57.953
I said, “I’ll name the person,”

43:58.370 --> 44:01.620
and I told them who has done it: Hilary.

44:02.454 --> 44:04.661
They were all amazed at it.

44:05.203 --> 44:07.495
I said, “This photograph is no good.”

44:07.870 --> 44:10.162
But now they had put it everywhere. I said, “Let it be.”

44:10.620 --> 44:14.370
So many people came to My program, all funny types, you know.

44:14.786 --> 44:16.911
Some had one eye, some had one nose,

44:17.245 --> 44:21.287
some had something else wrong, everything missing.

44:21.661 --> 44:25.037
“Oh God,” I said, “this is the thing of the photograph.”

44:25.619 --> 44:28.828
And not one person came back.

44:29.454 --> 44:30.953
We had at least about five,

44:31.329 --> 44:34.162
six hundred people for the program, all like this, you see.

44:34.579 --> 44:37.370
[Marathi]

44:38.120 --> 44:42.329
And none of them came back, not one person.

44:42.911 --> 44:47.078
All bhoots, attracted by the bhoot; and I could see

44:47.412 --> 44:50.995
on My photograph that it was just repelling it.

44:52.870 --> 44:56.953
So those who take My photograph also

44:57.537 --> 45:02.120
reflect in the photograph.

45:02.911 --> 45:06.287
You must have seen Ray’s photograph come out very well.

45:06.745 --> 45:08.287
I don’t which one is Ray’s here,

45:08.661 --> 45:10.870
but Ray’s photographs used to be very good.

45:11.329 --> 45:13.953
And this time Ray, he has a funny wife, I think.

45:14.454 --> 45:16.370
He went to India, and Indians told Me,

45:16.828 --> 45:18.995
“Mother, I don’t know how this Ray is so ruined.”

45:19.329 --> 45:20.162
In India it doesn’t happen.

45:20.537 --> 45:22.619
Once a Sahaja yogi, then they improve.

45:23.037 --> 45:26.370
But this fellow was just the opposite – now what to do?

45:26.870 --> 45:28.828
They said, “Mother, he’s all gone down, what to do?”

45:29.245 --> 45:32.412
I said, “Must have been something wrong. What to do?”

45:32.911 --> 45:34.620
When I came back, you see,

45:34.995 --> 45:36.703
Ray brought three or four photographs of Mine.

45:37.037 --> 45:38.786
When he showed, everybody was shocked.

45:39.203 --> 45:42.120
“These are not Mother’s photographs.”

45:42.703 --> 45:46.661
And he had to withdraw them. This is what it is.

45:47.037 --> 45:49.579
Same Ray who made such beautiful photographs

45:49.995 --> 45:52.661
was having horrible photographs nowadays.

45:53.120 --> 45:57.203
So, in everything what you do, everything that you achieve,

45:57.661 --> 45:59.120
you can make it out.

45:59.619 --> 46:04.786
You suddenly become an extremely posh person, you can say,

46:05.245 --> 46:07.828
with a finesse, once you are a good Sahaja yogi.

46:08.203 --> 46:11.329
Everything comes in proper stream.

46:11.745 --> 46:14.579
You can make it out, very simple ways

46:15.037 --> 46:20.619
of such a person are so pleasing and so soothing.

46:22.619 --> 46:26.579
So, on these points I have covered lots of things

46:26.911 --> 46:30.995
which I wanted to say, and that end with it

46:31.370 --> 46:35.537
I would say that as Vishuddhis you have to become the sakshi,

46:35.911 --> 46:38.203
the witness. You have to become the witness.

46:38.703 --> 46:41.579
And to become the witness there has to be a detachment.

46:41.995 --> 46:44.911
That doesn’t mean you live on a shoestring by any chance,

46:45.370 --> 46:48.370
but try to have a detachment.

46:48.786 --> 46:52.620
Thank God this time the experience of the Sahaja yogis

46:53.120 --> 46:54.661
from America was not so bad.

46:55.078 --> 46:56.329
They were very good people,

46:56.703 --> 46:59.619
they adjusted themselves well and they enjoyed themselves.

46:59.995 --> 47:01.287
It was fine.

47:01.620 --> 47:07.287
And I hope more and more will come and will enjoy themselves.

47:07.703 --> 47:10.495
And as you know the new programming has taken place.

47:10.870 --> 47:13.995
Is better you people tell us if you are coming or not.

47:14.454 --> 47:16.412
But also, don’t change last minute,

47:16.870 --> 47:21.495
it creates problems for us, for everyone.

47:21.995 --> 47:25.162
So please don’t change; if you’re not coming, it’s all right.

47:25.619 --> 47:28.245
You will have a certain date, by that time you decide,

47:28.619 --> 47:31.245
don’t change. You see it’s only Americans who did this,

47:31.661 --> 47:34.120
nobody else.

47:34.537 --> 47:35.620
And we told people,

47:35.995 --> 47:38.454
“Now no more, let’s give more chance to Americans are coming,

47:38.786 --> 47:41.203
we should give them more chance; so no, you are not coming.”

47:41.619 --> 47:44.619
So poor things, they came for ten days, five days,

47:45.162 --> 47:48.619
because we could not arrange for them.

47:49.579 --> 47:51.412
So, you should not change your ideas.

47:51.953 --> 47:55.329
If you are coming you can decide up to a point,

47:55.786 --> 47:57.620
if you are coming or not coming.

47:58.078 --> 48:01.703
If you are not coming you just say, “Yes, we are not coming,”

48:02.078 --> 48:04.995
or if you are coming you just say,

48:05.370 --> 48:07.537
“Yes we are coming,” and you do it.

48:07.995 --> 48:11.454
At least that much you should not change.

48:12.661 --> 48:16.454
So again, I request you to keep to your schedules and things,

48:16.870 --> 48:20.162
because it really upsets the whole thing.

48:20.620 --> 48:23.911
Because now we are working on the rhythm of the Divine,

48:24.454 --> 48:26.953
and we have no business to upset the rhythm.

48:28.995 --> 48:31.661
You may be Americans, but as you know in Sahaja Yoga

48:32.162 --> 48:34.619
Americans are not placed very high up.

48:35.162 --> 48:36.661
You know that very well.

48:37.162 --> 48:40.078
And we think Italians are much better off;

48:40.619 --> 48:45.579
they take to Sahaja Yoga just like a fish takes to water.

48:46.828 --> 48:50.162
So, Americans have to work a little harder,

48:50.620 --> 48:55.703
they have to do a little more to get to that adjustments.

48:57.745 --> 49:01.870
What to do? Such a great a country, so many seekers,

49:02.370 --> 49:04.870
but they are already ruined – what am I to do?

49:05.370 --> 49:06.412
Trying My level best.

49:06.786 --> 49:09.162
You all should help and understand the difficulties,

49:09.619 --> 49:11.828
and you have to be kind to the newcomers and see

49:12.329 --> 49:15.329
that you put them right.

49:16.370 --> 49:22.412
So, we have to think of our ascent from San Diego,

49:22.870 --> 49:26.245
and from this corner we are going to enlighten

49:26.661 --> 49:29.828
the whole of America.

49:30.245 --> 49:33.329
For practical purposes I’ve decided

49:33.745 --> 49:37.078
that Dr. Worlikar should be in charge

49:37.537 --> 49:43.245
in the eastern side

49:43.786 --> 49:46.495
[Marathi]

49:47.120 --> 49:49.995
– western side.

49:50.412 --> 49:53.078
For us, New York is already western, all right;

49:53.579 --> 49:56.995
and the eastern side is, the New York side

49:57.454 --> 50:00.495
can be managed by him.

50:00.911 --> 50:03.661
Because there’s a, like a two countries it is, two countries,

50:04.078 --> 50:05.370
two different types of thing.

50:05.870 --> 50:07.619
So that is how it is to be managed.

50:08.203 --> 50:12.579
Money matters: you should do deal with money matters

50:12.911 --> 50:14.037
with his consent.

50:14.495 --> 50:18.037
So, I told him how I do it is that the money

50:18.454 --> 50:21.745
is kept in the bank under the name of the

50:22.203 --> 50:24.412
registered name or whichever way it is,

50:24.870 --> 50:30.619
and they have the check book, but I have to sign.

50:31.537 --> 50:33.661
So, you keep the check book but he has to sign,

50:34.037 --> 50:36.287
so he sees what you are spending.

50:36.745 --> 50:38.037
So, check is there.

50:38.495 --> 50:40.370
Or you do the same there, see,

50:40.703 --> 50:43.203
so that she keeps the check book but you sign,

50:43.579 --> 50:45.745
so you know how much is being spent.

50:46.203 --> 50:47.245
So, there’s a check.

50:47.661 --> 50:50.037
Of course, as far as you people are concerned,

50:50.370 --> 50:52.495
I know it’s all right, but still ….

50:52.911 --> 50:57.120
Why I do so many things, just to make you understand.

50:57.703 --> 51:02.245
Like if you give Me puja money, I keep a packet of that.

51:02.745 --> 51:04.078
I keep an account of that.

51:04.537 --> 51:06.120
There’s no need: who’s going to ask Me

51:06.495 --> 51:07.953
what did I do with the puja money?

51:08.412 --> 51:11.370
But I do, I do keep it.

51:11.828 --> 51:15.120
And then what do I do with the puja money is that

51:15.619 --> 51:18.745
I want to use it for your puja materials, puja things,

51:19.120 --> 51:20.078
for presents and things.

51:20.370 --> 51:22.495
So, I keep. I need not do it, that’s My money,

51:22.828 --> 51:25.786
at least that much is Mine,

51:26.620 --> 51:28.619
but My pleasure is such.

51:28.995 --> 51:31.412
So that is how one must know that

51:31.703 --> 51:37.120
if Mother is so strict with it, why not we?

51:37.995 --> 51:40.703
You have to give money in puja, no doubt,

51:41.162 --> 51:42.329
because that has to be.

51:42.661 --> 51:44.245
First, we used to take one “p”.

51:44.703 --> 51:48.745
Then I went to two “p”, then to five “p’s”, ten “p’s”

51:49.245 --> 51:51.786
– it has increased like that.

51:52.287 --> 51:53.579
And for these pujas then,

51:53.911 --> 51:55.703
for the main pujas that we are going to have,

51:56.120 --> 51:58.495
one on New York, they have decided certain amount.

51:58.870 --> 52:00.661
That is your decision, I never said anything,

52:01.120 --> 52:03.661
because I was only up to one pound, I was there.

52:04.120 --> 52:06.579
Then I don’t know, I got lost with these people.

52:07.245 --> 52:10.620
So whatever they decide, that is there,

52:11.120 --> 52:14.579
is the money that is collected under the name of puja,

52:15.037 --> 52:18.995
which I have to take for the Nabhi Chakra.

52:19.495 --> 52:23.620
You have to do it with heart, just like the Shabari style,

52:24.120 --> 52:28.911
and everything will fall in proper places.

52:30.078 --> 52:34.786
So one can say that

52:35.329 --> 52:38.412
Sahaja Yoga is not an extreme thing.

52:38.870 --> 52:40.620
We do give money;

52:41.037 --> 52:43.620
only the Sahaja yogis can donate money.

52:44.203 --> 52:46.703
Say, for food here you have to pay,

52:47.203 --> 52:48.537
for the house you have to pay.

52:48.911 --> 52:51.870
You do pay, you don’t live here like parasites.

52:52.370 --> 52:54.454
We don’t want parasites around us.

52:54.911 --> 52:56.995
But it doesn’t also mean that you rob

52:57.370 --> 53:00.495
a Sahaja yogi completely and make him a pauper,

53:00.911 --> 53:04.870
and build your own Rolls Royces!

53:07.329 --> 53:13.037
So it is not also the other way, that you people rob Me.

53:16.995 --> 53:21.287
So one has to understand that Sahaja Yoga is give and take,

53:21.703 --> 53:24.037
in a proper certain manners,

53:24.537 --> 53:28.703
and that has to be properly done with grace,

53:29.203 --> 53:33.495
with understanding, with a beautiful feeling

53:33.953 --> 53:37.619
that we are all part and parcel of the whole.

53:40.579 --> 53:44.537
And for which America is responsible,

53:44.995 --> 53:48.786
because America has to become the Virat.

53:52.078 --> 53:56.037
The Vishuddhi has to become the Virat.

53:57.870 --> 54:00.537
What a responsibility!

54:01.078 --> 54:03.078
So don’t quarrel among yourselves,

54:03.579 --> 54:06.786
don’t quarrel among husband and wife.

54:07.370 --> 54:14.245
Try to be one in complete unison, enjoy each other.

54:14.620 --> 54:17.786
That’s very important. All right.

54:18.120 --> 54:19.203
So may God bless you.

54:19.537 --> 54:22.412
[Marathi: This is Virata’s place]

54:22.870 --> 54:29.495
Even now the Right Vishuddhi is catching. All right.

54:30.329 --> 54:34.329
[Marathi – directions for puja]

56:46.661 --> 56:51.370
Now, I want those people who have not washed My feet so far,

56:51.828 --> 56:54.537
should come forward.

56:57.828 --> 57:00.037
One by one.

57:06.203 --> 57:08.412
Let them handle the situation.

57:08.703 --> 57:10.162
… can do it.

57:10.495 --> 57:12.245
Danny, you also come here.

57:12.579 --> 57:17.037
Now, two persons at a time will do it.

57:30.620 --> 57:33.370
It’s very cold water.

57:45.245 --> 57:48.078
Very good, very good. Very, very good.

57:52.745 --> 57:56.120
Rub it. Rub My feet.

59:05.245 --> 59:08.329
Now just see your vibrations.

59:12.037 --> 59:14.078
All right?

59:14.412 --> 59:15.911
Good?

59:16.245 --> 59:18.287
May God bless you. Now come along.

59:18.745 --> 59:20.620
Should be warm.

59:34.620 --> 59:38.995
Come along, both of you.

59:43.703 --> 59:46.454
May God bless you.

59:50.370 --> 59:52.370
Rub it.

59:52.786 --> 59:55.287
Put it on this one.

59:56.454 --> 59:59.037
Rub it.

01:01:11.745 --> 01:01:15.703
Done! Now, come along – see your vibrations.

01:01:24.495 --> 01:01:26.454
Now, keep smiling like that, it’s all right,

01:01:26.745 --> 01:01:30.245
it’s all right – the sari can be dried.

01:01:32.370 --> 01:01:34.745
May God bless you.

01:01:35.454 --> 01:01:37.745
On the eyes and the head, wipe it.

01:01:38.162 --> 01:01:40.786
Come along.

01:01:43.661 --> 01:01:46.495
Very good.

01:01:59.370 --> 01:02:01.703
May God bless you.

01:02:07.870 --> 01:02:14.037
Hold it with one hand, tight, and another hand, rub it hard.

01:02:38.370 --> 01:02:43.953
Ah, good. You can feel the vibrations well.

01:02:44.911 --> 01:02:49.995
Your right, left hand, rub it – the last finger, pull it out.

01:02:50.786 --> 01:02:54.037
Last finger, pull it out.

01:03:55.953 --> 01:03:58.495
It’s got it.

01:03:59.203 --> 01:04:02.037
Now, see your vibrations.

01:04:09.037 --> 01:04:11.078
May God bless you.

01:04:12.329 --> 01:04:14.370
On the eyes and the head.

01:04:14.661 --> 01:04:17.870
Come along. Your face has changed with this!

01:04:19.786 --> 01:04:22.454
All right? Good. May God bless.

01:04:27.953 --> 01:04:30.995
Perfect.

01:04:57.870 --> 01:05:01.786
That’s all. Come along. That’s better.

01:05:02.454 --> 01:05:05.828
Right, now hold it tight.

01:05:08.078 --> 01:05:09.828
Rub your full hand.

01:05:10.203 --> 01:05:14.412
You see, the hand, your hand is to be rubbed, not My feet.

01:05:16.162 --> 01:05:19.828
Pull that out. Pull it tight.

01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:36.245
Ah!

01:06:55.370 --> 01:06:58.162
Mm, good.

01:06:58.953 --> 01:07:00.870
I think we are all right.

01:07:01.745 --> 01:07:04.287
Now just sit, this side.

01:07:11.537 --> 01:07:13.537
All right?

01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:19.245
You can’t keep it.

01:07:19.619 --> 01:07:21.412
Put it on your head.

01:07:21.745 --> 01:07:25.245
On your head, and then wipe your eyes also.

01:07:31.661 --> 01:07:34.037
May God bless you.

01:07:44.245 --> 01:07:46.828
I think you come with him, that’s all right.

01:07:48.579 --> 01:07:51.329
It’s all right. A little water.

01:07:51.620 --> 01:07:55.661
Now, they can use the same water to do My feet. Come along.

01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:06.245
May God bless you.

01:08:07.078 --> 01:08:08.953
Now...

01:08:14.703 --> 01:08:19.786
Hold it. Rub it hard.

01:08:26.162 --> 01:08:29.245
Rub it hard.

01:09:14.495 --> 01:09:17.203
Now see.

01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:31.619
Now.

01:09:33.620 --> 01:09:35.745
All right?

01:09:36.454 --> 01:09:40.370
See the left is – a little bit.

01:10:17.162 --> 01:10:18.329
All right.

01:10:18.537 --> 01:10:20.245
While sitting, just put the left hand towards Me,

01:10:20.579 --> 01:10:22.786
right hand on the Mother Earth.

01:10:23.329 --> 01:10:28.370
Good? May God bless.

01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:42.370
Good. Now, just see yourselves.

01:11:52.745 --> 01:11:54.995
How are you? All right?

01:11:55.412 --> 01:11:58.495
Not yet, feeling?

01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:05.329
Good. Very good.

01:12:12.162 --> 01:12:14.953
May God bless you.

01:12:43.037 --> 01:12:47.245
Put your left hand here. Rub it.

01:13:25.287 --> 01:13:28.329
All right. Now see for yourself.

01:13:36.329 --> 01:13:37.620
All right?

01:13:45.579 --> 01:13:48.162
May God bless you.

01:13:51.911 --> 01:13:57.579
Just put it on your head first, and then on your eyes.

01:13:58.661 --> 01:14:00.579
Good, nice.

01:14:00.953 --> 01:14:04.495
Feeling fine? Shiny, eh?

01:14:18.329 --> 01:14:21.078
Little bit you can lift from this side, this one;

01:14:21.495 --> 01:14:24.703
this side, yes.

01:14:27.370 --> 01:14:29.745
That’s all right.

01:15:17.078 --> 01:15:19.620
Done!

01:15:20.203 --> 01:15:22.995
See yourself now.

01:15:29.162 --> 01:15:32.162
May God bless.

01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:40.703
Has he washed?

01:15:42.495 --> 01:15:44.620
Her husband?

01:15:44.995 --> 01:15:47.745
He’s washed My feet?

01:15:48.537 --> 01:15:52.619
You both? Both are washed?

01:15:53.745 --> 01:15:56.203
All right.

01:15:57.412 --> 01:15:59.287
So, do you want to wash it again?

01:15:59.661 --> 01:16:03.120
All right. Now come.

01:16:05.870 --> 01:16:09.120
Are you all right, Jeshua?

01:16:11.370 --> 01:16:14.162
Better.

01:16:15.619 --> 01:16:17.620
All right.

01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:20.162
Let him play with the water.

01:16:32.329 --> 01:16:34.203
Close his hands.

01:16:34.537 --> 01:16:36.995
Ask him to play with the water, would be better.

01:16:37.454 --> 01:16:40.370
In the water. Ask him to immerse his feet in the water.

01:16:45.786 --> 01:16:49.953
Put it on Mine. Wash My feet.

01:16:50.495 --> 01:16:52.579
Good, good, good.

01:16:52.828 --> 01:16:54.745
Then touch My feet.

01:16:55.078 --> 01:16:57.870
Now put his hands on Mine.

01:17:17.620 --> 01:17:20.579
Good. Hallo! All right.

01:17:26.412 --> 01:17:28.661
So may God bless you all.

01:17:29.078 --> 01:17:31.537
He’s all right now.

01:17:32.329 --> 01:17:35.370
You have washed, both of you have washed.

01:19:17.619 --> 01:19:20.287
Just put more water.

01:19:23.037 --> 01:19:25.953
Pour all that, I think.

01:19:29.037 --> 01:19:31.620
And more is needed.

01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:38.245
That is better.

01:21:39.245 --> 01:21:42.412
Hundred-and-eight names.

01:21:48.828 --> 01:21:52.203
You said hundred-and-eight names you have got.

01:22:02.703 --> 01:22:05.620
Hundred-and-eight names.

01:22:29.745 --> 01:22:32.162
You showed Me thousand names you had.

01:22:32.745 --> 01:22:35.370
These are …

01:22:35.786 --> 01:22:38.911
hundred-and-eight.

01:23:17.245 --> 01:23:20.454
These are the hundred-and-eight names?

01:23:23.078 --> 01:23:26.287
Of Mahakali.

01:23:30.579 --> 01:23:33.203
Oh, take a hundred names.

01:23:37.495 --> 01:23:38.661
It starts with Shri Mata?

01:23:38.995 --> 01:23:41.661
Take out that one, all right?

01:23:49.745 --> 01:23:50.953
Sahasranama.

01:23:51.329 --> 01:23:53.995
Yes, we have Shri Lalita.

01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:05.537
This is the praise,

01:24:05.828 --> 01:24:07.995
after the Goddess killed the two rakshasas

01:24:08.370 --> 01:24:09.953
called Shumba, Nishumba.

01:24:10.370 --> 01:24:12.703
They’re all again back on the seat.

01:24:13.078 --> 01:24:16.745
So now the praise of the gods,

01:24:17.203 --> 01:24:19.037
you have to do the same praise.

01:24:19.537 --> 01:24:21.329
Now, we’ll start – you know that

01:24:21.745 --> 01:24:24.078
up to a point he will read it,

01:24:24.537 --> 01:24:27.370
and then he will tell you that

01:24:27.828 --> 01:24:30.162
you have to put it “Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu”

01:24:30.619 --> 01:24:32.995
– he’ll tell you “Buddhi” so you should put it,

01:24:33.370 --> 01:24:35.786
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu Buddhi rupena samsthita.”

01:24:36.162 --> 01:24:37.995
You know that – “Namas Tasyai namas Tasyai

01:24:38.370 --> 01:24:39.412
namas Tasyai namoh namah.”

01:26:40.287 --> 01:26:42.703
First he will say the beginning of it.

01:26:43.078 --> 01:26:45.911
This is how the gods, you see, praised the Goddess,

01:26:46.329 --> 01:26:49.495
when She killed Shumba, Nishumba. So ….

01:26:53.745 --> 01:26:56.953
The first of all you have to give the – what you call

01:26:57.245 --> 01:26:58.995
– the ghee.

01:26:59.537 --> 01:27:01.619
But there is no spoon.

01:27:02.037 --> 01:27:05.495
For ghee at least you have some spoons.

01:28:09.162 --> 01:28:11.911
Also the moon.

01:28:12.287 --> 01:28:13.953
She’s like moon.

01:28:14.329 --> 01:28:16.579
Face is like moon ….

01:28:21.162 --> 01:28:23.537
Just water.

01:28:38.579 --> 01:28:41.370
“Sarva” is the essence.

01:28:41.870 --> 01:28:44.620
She’s the one who’s the ruler of everything.

01:28:57.203 --> 01:29:03.870
Extremely gentle, and extremely harsh.

01:29:10.911 --> 01:29:13.786
We are the intelligence.

01:29:16.245 --> 01:29:18.619
She’s the intelligence in every human being.

01:29:18.995 --> 01:29:20.329
She’s expressed as intelligence,

01:29:20.620 --> 01:29:22.620
pure intelligence in every human being.

01:29:33.995 --> 01:29:35.619
So you just say “Shraddha.”

01:29:35.953 --> 01:29:37.579
And now you repeat together.

01:29:37.911 --> 01:29:40.537
You say “Shraddha” – now say.

01:31:59.120 --> 01:32:02.287
Should be sugar and then water.

01:34:42.537 --> 01:34:44.745
Unmarried girls now.

01:34:49.287 --> 01:34:51.828
Unmarried.

01:35:42.828 --> 01:35:45.619
She used to do it always in Bombay.

01:35:56.620 --> 01:35:58.620
You also do it the same way.

01:36:09.828 --> 01:36:12.120
Now.

01:36:35.454 --> 01:36:36.579
You should say,

01:36:40.245 --> 01:36:43.162
“Sakshat Shri Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi namoh namah.

01:36:43.454 --> 01:36:45.495
Shri Mata Sakshat Shri …”

01:36:45.828 --> 01:36:48.579
– what do you say?

01:36:51.412 --> 01:36:54.120
Just say, “Om twamewa sakshat Shri Mata,”

01:36:54.454 --> 01:36:55.870
that’s all – “namoh namah.”

01:36:56.162 --> 01:36:58.619
Yes, that’s all. That’s all.

01:37:03.661 --> 01:37:05.953
[Yogi: These are hundred and eight out of the thousand names

01:37:06.329 --> 01:37:10.037
of Mahadevi given in the “Shri Lalita Sahasranama.”]

01:37:48.078 --> 01:37:51.537
First is “Shri Mata.” So now say

01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:51.454
“Pataka nashini”

01:40:52.745 --> 01:40:54.786
– killer of all the sins.

01:40:55.162 --> 01:40:56.828
So that’s why I said, don’t feel guilty.

01:40:57.287 --> 01:40:59.995
She’s the killer of all the sins.

01:41:01.370 --> 01:41:04.245
Maha-pat: the greatest of –

01:41:05.329 --> 01:41:08.037
Maha-pataka nashini.

01:44:32.162 --> 01:44:35.911
“Nistula” – means “uncomparable.”

01:46:22.078 --> 01:46:24.287
You should first of all touch here.

01:46:32.454 --> 01:46:35.162
First.

01:46:56.495 --> 01:46:59.037
Go and wash your hands.

01:47:05.537 --> 01:47:09.495
Unmarried women. Unmarried.

01:49:52.037 --> 01:49:53.037
With the Para-shakti,

01:49:53.370 --> 01:49:57.203
all the work which it looks at all happens.

01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:04.078
“Yogada.”

01:50:04.786 --> 01:50:08.329
I have given you the yoga, you see, the union.

01:50:42.454 --> 01:50:45.454
“Labdhaa. Punya-labhya” – by the punyas.

01:50:45.745 --> 01:50:49.454
You see, if you have no punyas, you cannot find any.

01:50:50.537 --> 01:50:52.745
So if many people are lost, you shouldn’t worry;

01:50:53.037 --> 01:50:54.995
they have no punyas. What can you do?

01:50:55.412 --> 01:50:57.703
“Punya-labdhaa.”

01:52:11.245 --> 01:52:14.619
“Shobhana-sulabha-gati” – “Shobhana” means “gracious”,

01:52:14.995 --> 01:52:17.703
“sulabha” means “easy” and by that,

01:52:18.120 --> 01:52:20.703
“gati” … “movement.”

01:52:21.370 --> 01:52:25.037
You get to the, your realization through

01:52:25.370 --> 01:52:26.619
“Shobhana-sulabha-gati.”

01:52:26.995 --> 01:52:29.745
There is no disgraceful behavior,

01:52:30.245 --> 01:52:32.661
or it is very beautifully done,

01:52:33.203 --> 01:52:36.162
and also “sulabha” is “easy.”

01:53:40.661 --> 01:53:44.203
“Shubha-kari” – Giver of auspiciousness.

01:55:19.120 --> 01:55:24.287
Not the red. No, not the red. Now, two.

01:56:24.953 --> 01:56:27.203
Unmarried.

01:56:37.162 --> 01:56:39.245
One, one person.

01:56:39.619 --> 01:56:42.162
All right, all of you!

01:56:48.120 --> 01:56:50.953
All of you have to hold it in the hand.

01:56:52.661 --> 01:56:54.953
Now, hold it in your hand, all of you, here.

01:56:55.078 --> 01:56:56.786
Now from top.

01:56:57.120 --> 01:57:00.870
Yes, just hold it, right hand.

01:57:01.287 --> 01:57:04.620
Hold it with the right. Here, one can hold it.

01:57:07.037 --> 01:57:10.703
Now, put it.

01:57:14.203 --> 01:57:17.037
So thank you.

01:57:41.370 --> 01:57:44.412
“Pasha-hantri, Pasha-hantri” –

01:57:47.495 --> 01:57:49.370
You see, they are under bondage.

01:57:49.745 --> 01:57:54.370
She’s the one who kills all the bondages, pash.

01:57:58.078 --> 01:58:01.454
May God bless you.

02:00:32.619 --> 02:00:35.620
“Vandaru-jana-vatsala”

02:00:36.495 --> 02:00:38.703
– those who bow to Her,

02:00:39.078 --> 02:00:45.412
She is … She is kind to them like a Mother.

02:00:46.412 --> 02:00:48.078
She mothers them.

02:00:48.412 --> 02:00:51.412
Those who bow to Her, She mothers them.

02:01:38.703 --> 02:01:41.786
May God bless you.
