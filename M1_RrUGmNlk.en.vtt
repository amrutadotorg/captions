00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:08.660
So what happens in the body?

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:15.660
And first of all we have already seen a bit
of the explanation of the chakra chart here.

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:22.199
And what you will see here - this is the central
nervous system.

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.640
The central nervous system, this is the spinal
cord, this is the brain.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.680
And the limbic area of the brain is quite
important and I will talk about it later.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:36.160
Lies within the brain in the middle, and this
is the centre of our emotions and motivation.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.390
So this is the central nervous system, what
you will see next is actually the autonomic

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.010
nervous system, which is also depicted here.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.160
So this is the left and right sympathetic
nervous system, and the middle channel corresponds

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.940
to the parasympathetic nervous system.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.770
And the spiritual energy we have inside when
we meditate actually passes through all of

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.070
these nerve plexuses

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.719
So this is the solar plexus, this is the throat,
cervical plexus.

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.719
And it enter the limbic area of the brain
and when it enters the limbic area of the

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:14.499
brain, then you become thoughtless.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:22.400
All these different chakras, they correspond
to the nerve plexuses and to the endochrine

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.099
system.

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:31.209
So, the sympathetic nervous system and the
parasympathetic nervous system are very important

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:33.079
and they need to be in balance.

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:37.669
So in daily life, we are either in this what
is called the fight or flight mode, you activate

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:40.090
the right or the left sympathetic nervous
system.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:46.029
One is important for action, one is important
for inhibition and in the night, when you

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:49.229
sleep, you activate the parasympathetic nervous
system.

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.049
So this system relaxes and restores all of
the bodily functions, while the other one

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:56.200
is important for daily activities.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.539
Now they have to be in balance.

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:01.729
So if you think you can survive with four
hours of sleep per day, then you are sadly

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.939
mistaken, you will pay for it later with your
health for this habit.

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:09.899
Because it is important that your body gets
restored.

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.159
So the sympathetic nervous system is activated
in daily activities and the more stressed

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:17.269
you are, the more it is activated.

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:23.719
So what it does, it supplies maximum blood
to the muscles for daily activities.

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:26.739
The stress hormones are increased.

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.159
The passages of the lungs are dilated.

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:32.670
You have increased heart rate.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.920
And if you are constantly stressed it may
actually affect your heart.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:43.920
And during rest, when you activate the parasympathetic
nervous system, the opposite happens.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.519
And you have a decreased heart rate.

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:52.500
More blood is given to all the organs, which
restores all the bodily functions which you

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.319
have wasted during the day.

00:02:54.319 --> 00:03:00.829
There is decreased activity of stress hormones
and the digestion is stimulated.

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:07.200
Now, research has shown that meditation activated
the parasympathetic nervous system more than

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:07.840
rest.

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.999
So that means you enter a state of hyper - rest,
which is better than sleep.

00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:17.999
And this has been shown by many studies conducted
in India and in Australia.

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.909
So what happens is there is a decrease in
the heart rate.

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:26.719
There is a decrease in the breathing rate.

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:28.180
There is a decrease in pulse rate.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.200
There is a decrease in blood pressure, in
oxygen metabolism.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.700
This is anti - ageing.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.579
And there is a decrease in other physiological
parameters of stress.

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:39.639
I will show you a few examples.

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:44.590
So, this is the blood pressure in controls.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:51.590
So these people during twenty minutes rest,
nothing really happens.

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:56.579
These are people who have meditated for four
weeks so after twenty minutes of meditation

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:59.459
only, the blood pressure goes down.

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.029
Those who meditated for eight weeks have a
stronger effect.

00:04:03.029 --> 00:04:07.269
Those who meditated for twelve weeks have
a really strong effect.

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:12.989
So in other words, if you have high blood
pressure, you can reduce it by meditation.

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:16.150
This is the heart rate. Again with controls.

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.889
And again the more practiced that the people
are in meditation, the more the heart rate

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:22.190
goes down.

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.169
This is of course very good.

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:23.990
It protects your heart.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.139
If you constantly have a reduction of heart
rate on a daily basis.

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:32.130
That's very good for you and of course all
the other measures as well.

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.780
This is a study by Doctor Chung from Philadelphia
University.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:42.750
She took people who had hypertension and she
gave them one week of intensive meditation.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:48.819
They had to meditate in a meditation hospital
every day for, I don't know, eight hours or

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:49.169
so.

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:50.599
And the blood pressure.

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:51.860
The high blood pressure

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:58.860
went down significantly in the meditators,
but not in the controls who were getting normal

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:01.460
treatment in a normal hospital.

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:07.400
So meditation is far better and in only after
one week, you can reduce your hypertension.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.599
Which is quite impressive.

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:15.700
So in conclusion, the state of mental silence
reduces sympathetic activity and what it means

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.720
is it enhances the parasympathetic activity.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:25.720
Which restores all of your bodily functions
and de-stresses the body.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.050
Now another very curious phenomenon.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.979
Which, if you may have noticed if you've meditated
with us for a while.

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:36.110
And if you know you will feel it at the end
when we have the meditation.

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.669
When you achieve the state of mental silence,
you feel a cool breeze.

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:42.520
On the hands and on the top of the fontanelle
area.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.250
And the fontanelle is called the fontanelle
because it comes out like a fountain.

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.680
So, this cool breeze is described in the bible
for example, it's called the cool breeze of

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:52.860
the Holy Ghost.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.680
The Holy Ghost of course means your own spiritual
energy.

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.240
And studies have actually shown that this
isn't just something that you imagine.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.000
Because sometimes people say.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.889
When we ask you 'Do you feel a cool breeze?'.

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:06.349
You know, they think they have to say 'yes'
to please you.

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:10.199
Or they think you're sort of suggesting it
and that's why they feel it.

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:10.900
This is not true.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.460
Studies have shown that.

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.060
This is people during the rest period.

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:19.440
And in the rest period, the temperature of
the hand actually goes up a little bit.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:20.400
So it's normal.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.180
But in meditation, the temperature goes down
significantly.

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:29.220
And this has been shown on the hands, and
on the top of the head, and some people even

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:30.680
feel it on the feet for example.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.659
So I think that...it can also be on the feet.

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:40.319
So, in conclusion, Sahaja Yoga meditation
activates the parasympathetic nervous system

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:43.159
and this restores your bodily functions.

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:45.520
Now, what about the brain?
