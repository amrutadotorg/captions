WEBVTT

00:39.136 --> 00:46.843
[Shri Mataji talks aside to a yogi and asks
him

00:48.119 --> 00:55.719
if he has got the 108 Names of the Guru

00:55.941 --> 01:01.899
to read them during the puja]

01:06.600 --> 01:11.896
Alright. So today first we have Ganesh Puja
because Ganesha is innocence

01:12.097 --> 01:18.938
and we have to establish Him in any place
where we want to start

01:19.139 --> 01:25.674
a work or do anything about it, because He
is innocence and innocence was created

01:25.875 --> 01:28.543
before everything else was created.

01:28.744 --> 01:37.701
Is the most powerful power, I should say,
innocence.

01:38.026 --> 01:42.410
And then we’ll do the Guru Puja which is
actually

01:42.611 --> 01:47.670
the Adi Guru, the Primordial Master, who
incarnated on this Earth many a times.

01:47.871 --> 01:55.780
And, as you know, as Dattatreya He was born,

01:55.996 --> 02:02.685
as Janaka, Nanaka and many others.

02:02.948 --> 02:06.210
That principle is within us and that is
very important

02:06.411 --> 02:13.706
that we should develop the principle
of Guru Nanak or Janak

02:13.907 --> 02:19.896
or anyone of these primordial masters.
Because if the Spirit is the master,

02:20.097 --> 02:28.641
we have to become the master of ourselves.
And the power of the masters are

02:28.842 --> 02:41.110
that they are essences of the innocence –
of the creator,

02:42.580 --> 02:48.492
of the sustainer and the destroyer.

02:50.261 --> 02:55.219
They are the innocence of all these. Out
of them – this great personality –

02:55.420 --> 03:02.392
innocence of these three personalities
was created this great incarnation.

03:02.593 --> 03:08.010
And their innocence is shown by their
detachment to things – they live everywhere

03:08.211 --> 03:13.006
just like other human beings – married,
living in the families,

03:13.207 --> 03:19.987
but absolutely detached. Unless and until
this principle is awakened in you,

03:20.188 --> 03:23.387
you cannot do Sahaja Yoga.

03:24.196 --> 03:31.771
First of all, this principle of Guru must
be awakened in you which gives you balance

03:32.269 --> 03:38.403
and then the ascent has to be brought in
through the Spirit, the Atma.

03:38.604 --> 03:42.391
That is done by the Shakti, by
the Kundalini Herself.

03:42.592 --> 03:47.513
She’s the Shakti, She’s the womb. She’s
the one Who nourishes, first of all.

03:47.714 --> 03:54.088
She nourishes that power within us,
nourishes us, nourishes all our chakras.

03:54.289 --> 04:02.616
By which She cures our mental, emotional,
physical, spiritual being.

04:02.817 --> 04:05.707
Because sometimes we bow to wrong type
of people,

04:05.908 --> 04:09.033
our spiritual being is also very much hurt.

04:09.234 --> 04:12.797
And after that, after She has achieved
that,

04:12.998 --> 04:22.389
then She ascends through your fontanel bone
and gives you the Self Realization.

04:22.590 --> 04:27.925
So it is She who is the giver of your
moksha.

04:28.437 --> 04:33.157
She is the one who is the giver of
the peace, of the joy,

04:33.358 --> 04:38.730
and this Mother of yours resides in you
and She gives you the Realization.

04:38.931 --> 04:43.460
So we worship Her as the power within you,
so that you are empowered,

04:43.661 --> 04:52.066
you become powerful. But this power makes
you the master.

04:52.267 --> 04:56.467
When She comes in the Void area, She makes
you the Master

04:56.668 --> 05:04.241
because She enlightens that Guru principle
within you and you become the Master,

05:04.442 --> 05:09.736
you become the master of yourself and by
that you become the Master of others also.

05:09.937 --> 05:14.553
The one who is not the Master of oneself
cannot be the Master of others.

05:14.754 --> 05:19.567
So it works out, first of all, on you and
then it radiates.

05:19.768 --> 05:25.073
And that radiation makes others also accept
you as the guru.

05:25.274 --> 05:35.005
The dynamism and that compassionate
attitude

05:35.206 --> 05:41.447
all develops through this Guru principle.

05:41.648 --> 05:47.089
But this is the blessing of the Kundalini,
the Womb, the Mother,

05:47.290 --> 05:50.370
the one who we call as Aquarius.

05:50.571 --> 05:57.049
This is residing within us and we have to
just accept

05:57.250 --> 06:03.259
Her manifestation and welcome Her with
open heart.

06:03.460 --> 06:10.026
And know that today is the day when we are
expecting human beings

06:10.227 --> 06:16.026
to rise to that level where they become
compassion, love, affection.

06:17.231 --> 06:22.926
This is the new awareness with which we are
going to be

06:23.127 --> 06:26.711
completely fulfilled and unless and until
that happens

06:26.912 --> 06:32.717
there’s no chance for the emancipation,
no doubt about it.

06:34.617 --> 06:39.838
We have worked out so many things in so
many places

06:40.039 --> 06:44.704
and every place, I find, has a different
problem.

06:45.212 --> 06:50.450
The most difficult, I find, is America,
it’s like Mathura

06:50.651 --> 06:53.743
where Shri Krishna had to go and establish
Himself,

06:53.944 --> 06:59.670
that was the Kingdom of Shri Krishna and
where Kamsa was ruling.

06:59.871 --> 07:05.414
So the people in Mathura were the most
difficult people because they were governed

07:05.615 --> 07:10.746
by devils and the devils have a capacity
to dominate good people.

07:10.953 --> 07:14.682
They’re all so dominated that even where
Shri Krishna lived,

07:14.883 --> 07:22.983
they tried to go and harm Him and kill Him
and all that.

07:23.184 --> 07:28.489
And all the dynamism of these people from
Mathura was killed by Kamsa

07:28.690 --> 07:34.217
who was to be killed by Shri Krishna.

07:34.418 --> 07:37.778
Surprisingly, the first day I came to New
York for the puja,

07:37.979 --> 07:44.163
the first day it was written “Parivartani
Ekadashi”.

07:44.364 --> 07:51.028
Now “Ekadesha” is the power with which
the people are going to be destroyed.

07:51.229 --> 07:56.180
Now that is “Parivartani” means the one
by which you are going to be transformed.

07:56.381 --> 08:00.760
So, how is it the power that is going
to destroy is going to transform you.

08:00.961 --> 08:07.362
Firstly, it will destroy all that is
oppressive, all that kills your dynamism,

08:07.563 --> 08:11.898
all that makes you slave, that is going
to be destroyed.

08:12.099 --> 08:15.293
Secondly, people will be frightened,
the halfbaked ones

08:15.494 --> 08:21.575
who are neither here nor there, that we’ll
be destroyed and that awe will change them.

08:21.776 --> 08:26.183
Thirdly, when you see that your kith and
kin are going to be destroyed,

08:26.384 --> 08:30.757
then you’ll have much more compassion,
much more tolerance for them

08:30.958 --> 08:35.268
and you’ll try to save them all. So that is
what it is,

08:35.469 --> 08:41.709
where Shri Krishna had to raise a complete
mountain on His fingertip,

08:41.910 --> 08:46.838
you see like this, to the right side,
“Govardhandhari” He was called.

08:47.039 --> 08:50.424
That is what is my job here, is to raise
the mountain again

08:50.625 --> 08:56.713
and raise it on my finger tip like that.
But this finger has to be strong

08:56.914 --> 09:04.522
and this finger is nothing but the Sahaja
Yogis of America and they have to help

09:04.723 --> 09:12.621
by their dynamic behaviour and by their
proper understanding, responsibility

09:12.822 --> 09:19.529
as the people belonging to this great
nation of Fatherhood.

09:19.730 --> 09:25.269
This is the finger of the Father and that
Fatherhood has to be dynamic,

09:25.470 --> 09:33.927
has to be overpowering and has to be very
responsible.

09:34.128 --> 09:37.633
And in that responsibility you learn so
many things –

09:37.834 --> 09:41.286
so that’s my job is, that’s my goal is.
She (tv host) asked me in the TV,

09:41.487 --> 09:44.727
“What is your goal, Mother?” I didn’t tell
her that I have to raise

09:44.928 --> 09:48.079
the mountain on my finger, you see, she
would never have understood that.

09:48.280 --> 09:50.949
But that is what one has to do here.

09:51.150 --> 09:56.917
To raise the mountain and I find it’s like
that – Mountainous.

09:57.118 --> 10:02.983
And base of the mountain seems to be Houston
which is the most difficult part of it,

10:03.184 --> 10:09.576
they just don’t move, they just don’t move,
its jada it's very, very ‘tamasic’,

10:09.777 --> 10:15.010
it’s so full of ignorance and so full
of heaviness.

10:15.211 --> 10:19.278
That is the most difficult part and that’s
why – for Houston specially –

10:19.479 --> 10:24.832
we should do a nice puja to the Kundalini
that She rises in Houston.

10:25.033 --> 10:27.722
May God bless you all.

10:32.354 --> 10:35.949
Can you give me the handkerchief.

10:52.750 --> 10:55.930
Yogi: Today it’s said it’s Anant
Chaturdashi. Shri Mataji: Uh?

10:56.131 --> 10:59.839
Yogi: Anant Chaturdashi.
Shri Mataji: Today? Ah-ah!

11:00.040 --> 11:03.926
That’s great! Yes, must be. I was wondering
Anant Chaturdashi.

11:04.127 --> 11:09.780
Anant Chaturdashi is the day when we

11:11.769 --> 11:18.145
‘visarjan’– dissolve Shri Ganesha
in the water.

11:18.420 --> 11:22.014
(Hindi : it’s that day we put the Ganesha
in to the water)

11:22.215 --> 11:28.011
Because He’s established for ten days and
after ten days, He’s born on the fourth,

11:28.212 --> 11:33.964
after ten days He’s dissolved in the water
so that everywhere His Power is spread

11:34.165 --> 11:38.345
through the water. That’s why no wonder
there was a puja.

11:38.546 --> 11:42.094
Ganesha settled down into the water.

11:42.295 --> 11:46.413
That is Ananta Chaturdashi. Ananta is the,
is Shri Ganesha.

11:46.614 --> 11:51.264
Ananta means which cannot be destroyed.
Innocence cannot be destroyed.

11:51.465 --> 11:56.186
And that is why is the Ganesh Chaturdashi
means the day

11:56.387 --> 12:01.495
when Ganesha is dissolved in the water,

12:02.067 --> 12:10.550
in the ocean or He is created, worshipped
for ten days and again given back.

12:12.726 --> 12:18.509
So it’s a very great day today, I should
say, like the resurrection of Christ

12:18.710 --> 12:24.872
that you are,

12:27.144 --> 12:31.283
you had Christ here, He lived with you,

12:31.484 --> 12:36.052
and then went back to His Father. Father is
the ocean

12:36.253 --> 12:41.429
and that’s what in India they do, establish
Him on the fourth day

12:41.630 --> 12:45.064
and on the tenth day they put Him back
to the ocean.

12:45.265 --> 12:48.793
Yogi: We used to do the same thing in
our school. Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?

12:48.994 --> 12:51.102
Yogi: I said we used to do the same
thing in our school. Shri Mataji: Eh?

12:51.303 --> 12:53.339
Yogi: We used to do the same thing in our
school.

12:53.540 --> 12:57.495
Other yogi: He says that he did the same in
his school, they used to make the Ganesha.

12:57.696 --> 13:02.877
Shri Mataji: Really? What school?
Yogi: (School name).

13:03.083 --> 13:08.715
Yogi: So we used to have a statue and four
of the guys used to carry them on.

13:08.916 --> 13:11.645
Shri Mataji: But no one understands. They
just do it without understanding

13:11.846 --> 13:15.679
what they are doing about it. So it’s
a thing, even in India

13:15.880 --> 13:18.205
how many people know about Ganesha,
no one knows.

13:18.406 --> 13:21.471
Yogini: In Maharastra. Shri Mataji: In
Maharastra, they worship Him a lot

13:21.672 --> 13:25.345
but they don’t know much about it. They
don’t know how much He’s important,

13:25.546 --> 13:29.461
about what He represents, how did He came
on this earth, nothing they know.

13:29.662 --> 13:33.996
We have become very superficial that way.

13:37.841 --> 13:41.900
But at least it keeps your attention by
doing all these things, “there”.

13:42.101 --> 13:46.290
You see, this is the advantage of in India,
the children have to be little bit

13:46.491 --> 13:51.822
pinned down to a thing they, by festivals
and all that they try to then find out

13:52.023 --> 13:55.674
what is this, what is that. Their attention
is more there, not outside so much,

13:55.875 --> 13:58.191
you see, that’s the thing is.
