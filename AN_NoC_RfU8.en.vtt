00:00:39.136 --> 00:00:46.843
[Shri Mataji talks aside to a yogi and asks
him

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:55.719
if he has got the 108 Names of the Guru

00:00:55.941 --> 00:01:01.899
to read them during the puja]

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.896
Alright. So today first we have Ganesh Puja
because Ganesha is innocence

00:01:12.097 --> 00:01:18.938
and we have to establish Him in any place
where we want to start

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:25.674
a work or do anything about it, because He
is innocence and innocence was created

00:01:25.875 --> 00:01:28.543
before everything else was created.

00:01:28.744 --> 00:01:37.701
Is the most powerful power, I should say,
innocence.

00:01:38.026 --> 00:01:42.410
And then we’ll do the Guru Puja which is
actually

00:01:42.611 --> 00:01:47.670
the Adi Guru, the Primordial Master, who
incarnated on this Earth many a times.

00:01:47.871 --> 00:01:55.780
And, as you know, as Dattatreya He was born,

00:01:55.996 --> 00:02:02.685
as Janaka, Nanaka and many others.

00:02:02.948 --> 00:02:06.210
That principle is within us and that is
very important

00:02:06.411 --> 00:02:13.706
that we should develop the principle
of Guru Nanak or Janak

00:02:13.907 --> 00:02:19.896
or anyone of these primordial masters.
Because if the Spirit is the master,

00:02:20.097 --> 00:02:28.641
we have to become the master of ourselves.
And the power of the masters are

00:02:28.842 --> 00:02:41.110
that they are essences of the innocence –
of the creator,

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.492
of the sustainer and the destroyer.

00:02:50.261 --> 00:02:55.219
They are the innocence of all these. Out
of them – this great personality –

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:02.392
innocence of these three personalities
was created this great incarnation.

00:03:02.593 --> 00:03:08.010
And their innocence is shown by their
detachment to things – they live everywhere

00:03:08.211 --> 00:03:13.006
just like other human beings – married,
living in the families,

00:03:13.207 --> 00:03:19.987
but absolutely detached. Unless and until
this principle is awakened in you,

00:03:20.188 --> 00:03:23.387
you cannot do Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:24.196 --> 00:03:31.771
First of all, this principle of Guru must
be awakened in you which gives you balance

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:38.403
and then the ascent has to be brought in
through the Spirit, the Atma.

00:03:38.604 --> 00:03:42.391
That is done by the Shakti, by
the Kundalini Herself.

00:03:42.592 --> 00:03:47.513
She’s the Shakti, She’s the womb. She’s
the one Who nourishes, first of all.

00:03:47.714 --> 00:03:54.088
She nourishes that power within us,
nourishes us, nourishes all our chakras.

00:03:54.289 --> 00:04:02.616
By which She cures our mental, emotional,
physical, spiritual being.

00:04:02.817 --> 00:04:05.707
Because sometimes we bow to wrong type
of people,

00:04:05.908 --> 00:04:09.033
our spiritual being is also very much hurt.

00:04:09.234 --> 00:04:12.797
And after that, after She has achieved
that,

00:04:12.998 --> 00:04:22.389
then She ascends through your fontanel bone
and gives you the Self Realization.

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.925
So it is She who is the giver of your
moksha.

00:04:28.437 --> 00:04:33.157
She is the one who is the giver of
the peace, of the joy,

00:04:33.358 --> 00:04:38.730
and this Mother of yours resides in you
and She gives you the Realization.

00:04:38.931 --> 00:04:43.460
So we worship Her as the power within you,
so that you are empowered,

00:04:43.661 --> 00:04:52.066
you become powerful. But this power makes
you the master.

00:04:52.267 --> 00:04:56.467
When She comes in the Void area, She makes
you the Master

00:04:56.668 --> 00:05:04.241
because She enlightens that Guru principle
within you and you become the Master,

00:05:04.442 --> 00:05:09.736
you become the master of yourself and by
that you become the Master of others also.

00:05:09.937 --> 00:05:14.553
The one who is not the Master of oneself
cannot be the Master of others.

00:05:14.754 --> 00:05:19.567
So it works out, first of all, on you and
then it radiates.

00:05:19.768 --> 00:05:25.073
And that radiation makes others also accept
you as the guru.

00:05:25.274 --> 00:05:35.005
The dynamism and that compassionate
attitude

00:05:35.206 --> 00:05:41.447
all develops through this Guru principle.

00:05:41.648 --> 00:05:47.089
But this is the blessing of the Kundalini,
the Womb, the Mother,

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:50.370
the one who we call as Aquarius.

00:05:50.571 --> 00:05:57.049
This is residing within us and we have to
just accept

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:03.259
Her manifestation and welcome Her with
open heart.

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:10.026
And know that today is the day when we are
expecting human beings

00:06:10.227 --> 00:06:16.026
to rise to that level where they become
compassion, love, affection.

00:06:17.231 --> 00:06:22.926
This is the new awareness with which we are
going to be

00:06:23.127 --> 00:06:26.711
completely fulfilled and unless and until
that happens

00:06:26.912 --> 00:06:32.717
there’s no chance for the emancipation,
no doubt about it.

00:06:34.617 --> 00:06:39.838
We have worked out so many things in so
many places

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:44.704
and every place, I find, has a different
problem.

00:06:45.212 --> 00:06:50.450
The most difficult, I find, is America,
it’s like Mathura

00:06:50.651 --> 00:06:53.743
where Shri Krishna had to go and establish
Himself,

00:06:53.944 --> 00:06:59.670
that was the Kingdom of Shri Krishna and
where Kamsa was ruling.

00:06:59.871 --> 00:07:05.414
So the people in Mathura were the most
difficult people because they were governed

00:07:05.615 --> 00:07:10.746
by devils and the devils have a capacity
to dominate good people.

00:07:10.953 --> 00:07:14.682
They’re all so dominated that even where
Shri Krishna lived,

00:07:14.883 --> 00:07:22.983
they tried to go and harm Him and kill Him
and all that.

00:07:23.184 --> 00:07:28.489
And all the dynamism of these people from
Mathura was killed by Kamsa

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:34.217
who was to be killed by Shri Krishna.

00:07:34.418 --> 00:07:37.778
Surprisingly, the first day I came to New
York for the puja,

00:07:37.979 --> 00:07:44.163
the first day it was written “Parivartani
Ekadashi”.

00:07:44.364 --> 00:07:51.028
Now “Ekadesha” is the power with which
the people are going to be destroyed.

00:07:51.229 --> 00:07:56.180
Now that is “Parivartani” means the one
by which you are going to be transformed.

00:07:56.381 --> 00:08:00.760
So, how is it the power that is going
to destroy is going to transform you.

00:08:00.961 --> 00:08:07.362
Firstly, it will destroy all that is
oppressive, all that kills your dynamism,

00:08:07.563 --> 00:08:11.898
all that makes you slave, that is going
to be destroyed.

00:08:12.099 --> 00:08:15.293
Secondly, people will be frightened,
the halfbaked ones

00:08:15.494 --> 00:08:21.575
who are neither here nor there, that we’ll
be destroyed and that awe will change them.

00:08:21.776 --> 00:08:26.183
Thirdly, when you see that your kith and
kin are going to be destroyed,

00:08:26.384 --> 00:08:30.757
then you’ll have much more compassion,
much more tolerance for them

00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:35.268
and you’ll try to save them all. So that is
what it is,

00:08:35.469 --> 00:08:41.709
where Shri Krishna had to raise a complete
mountain on His fingertip,

00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:46.838
you see like this, to the right side,
“Govardhandhari” He was called.

00:08:47.039 --> 00:08:50.424
That is what is my job here, is to raise
the mountain again

00:08:50.625 --> 00:08:56.713
and raise it on my finger tip like that.
But this finger has to be strong

00:08:56.914 --> 00:09:04.522
and this finger is nothing but the Sahaja
Yogis of America and they have to help

00:09:04.723 --> 00:09:12.621
by their dynamic behaviour and by their
proper understanding, responsibility

00:09:12.822 --> 00:09:19.529
as the people belonging to this great
nation of Fatherhood.

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:25.269
This is the finger of the Father and that
Fatherhood has to be dynamic,

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:33.927
has to be overpowering and has to be very
responsible.

00:09:34.128 --> 00:09:37.633
And in that responsibility you learn so
many things –

00:09:37.834 --> 00:09:41.286
so that’s my job is, that’s my goal is.
She (tv host) asked me in the TV,

00:09:41.487 --> 00:09:44.727
“What is your goal, Mother?” I didn’t tell
her that I have to raise

00:09:44.928 --> 00:09:48.079
the mountain on my finger, you see, she
would never have understood that.

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.949
But that is what one has to do here.

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:56.917
To raise the mountain and I find it’s like
that – Mountainous.

00:09:57.118 --> 00:10:02.983
And base of the mountain seems to be Houston
which is the most difficult part of it,

00:10:03.184 --> 00:10:09.576
they just don’t move, they just don’t move,
its jada it's very, very ‘tamasic’,

00:10:09.777 --> 00:10:15.010
it’s so full of ignorance and so full
of heaviness.

00:10:15.211 --> 00:10:19.278
That is the most difficult part and that’s
why – for Houston specially –

00:10:19.479 --> 00:10:24.832
we should do a nice puja to the Kundalini
that She rises in Houston.

00:10:25.033 --> 00:10:27.722
May God bless you all.

00:10:32.354 --> 00:10:35.949
Can you give me the handkerchief.

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:55.930
Yogi: Today it’s said it’s Anant
Chaturdashi. Shri Mataji: Uh?

00:10:56.131 --> 00:10:59.839
Yogi: Anant Chaturdashi.
Shri Mataji: Today? Ah-ah!

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:03.926
That’s great! Yes, must be. I was wondering
Anant Chaturdashi.

00:11:04.127 --> 00:11:09.780
Anant Chaturdashi is the day when we

00:11:11.769 --> 00:11:18.145
‘visarjan’– dissolve Shri Ganesha
in the water.

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:22.014
(Hindi : it’s that day we put the Ganesha
in to the water)

00:11:22.215 --> 00:11:28.011
Because He’s established for ten days and
after ten days, He’s born on the fourth,

00:11:28.212 --> 00:11:33.964
after ten days He’s dissolved in the water
so that everywhere His Power is spread

00:11:34.165 --> 00:11:38.345
through the water. That’s why no wonder
there was a puja.

00:11:38.546 --> 00:11:42.094
Ganesha settled down into the water.

00:11:42.295 --> 00:11:46.413
That is Ananta Chaturdashi. Ananta is the,
is Shri Ganesha.

00:11:46.614 --> 00:11:51.264
Ananta means which cannot be destroyed.
Innocence cannot be destroyed.

00:11:51.465 --> 00:11:56.186
And that is why is the Ganesh Chaturdashi
means the day

00:11:56.387 --> 00:12:01.495
when Ganesha is dissolved in the water,

00:12:02.067 --> 00:12:10.550
in the ocean or He is created, worshipped
for ten days and again given back.

00:12:12.726 --> 00:12:18.509
So it’s a very great day today, I should
say, like the resurrection of Christ

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:24.872
that you are,

00:12:27.144 --> 00:12:31.283
you had Christ here, He lived with you,

00:12:31.484 --> 00:12:36.052
and then went back to His Father. Father is
the ocean

00:12:36.253 --> 00:12:41.429
and that’s what in India they do, establish
Him on the fourth day

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:45.064
and on the tenth day they put Him back
to the ocean.

00:12:45.265 --> 00:12:48.793
Yogi: We used to do the same thing in
our school. Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?

00:12:48.994 --> 00:12:51.102
Yogi: I said we used to do the same
thing in our school. Shri Mataji: Eh?

00:12:51.303 --> 00:12:53.339
Yogi: We used to do the same thing in our
school.

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:57.495
Other yogi: He says that he did the same in
his school, they used to make the Ganesha.

00:12:57.696 --> 00:13:02.877
Shri Mataji: Really? What school?
Yogi: (School name).

00:13:03.083 --> 00:13:08.715
Yogi: So we used to have a statue and four
of the guys used to carry them on.

00:13:08.916 --> 00:13:11.645
Shri Mataji: But no one understands. They
just do it without understanding

00:13:11.846 --> 00:13:15.679
what they are doing about it. So it’s
a thing, even in India

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:18.205
how many people know about Ganesha,
no one knows.

00:13:18.406 --> 00:13:21.471
Yogini: In Maharastra. Shri Mataji: In
Maharastra, they worship Him a lot

00:13:21.672 --> 00:13:25.345
but they don’t know much about it. They
don’t know how much He’s important,

00:13:25.546 --> 00:13:29.461
about what He represents, how did He came
on this earth, nothing they know.

00:13:29.662 --> 00:13:33.996
We have become very superficial that way.

00:13:37.841 --> 00:13:41.900
But at least it keeps your attention by
doing all these things, “there”.

00:13:42.101 --> 00:13:46.290
You see, this is the advantage of in India,
the children have to be little bit

00:13:46.491 --> 00:13:51.822
pinned down to a thing they, by festivals
and all that they try to then find out

00:13:52.023 --> 00:13:55.674
what is this, what is that. Their attention
is more there, not outside so much,

00:13:55.875 --> 00:13:58.191
you see, that’s the thing is.
