00:00:01.828 --> 00:00:10.040
Today we are going to celebrate the birth
of Jesus Christ.

00:00:19.373 --> 00:00:30.433
He came on this earth in a very special
way, that He was born to a Virgin.

00:00:31.741 --> 00:00:37.035
And we can understand

00:00:39.402 --> 00:00:49.080
as you know as Shri Ganesha was also born
in the same way,

00:00:49.281 --> 00:00:58.534
and as Jesus is an incarnation
of Shri Ganesha,

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:06.458
He had all His powers when He was born,

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:16.316
He did not have to bring any outward
weapons to show that what powers He had.

00:01:16.517 --> 00:01:20.866
But He had all the powers with Him,

00:01:21.067 --> 00:01:26.878
but still He tried to show tolerance and
understanding,

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:33.938
because at that time the people with whom
He had to deal

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:39.557
were absolutely ignorant of spirituality.

00:01:40.234 --> 00:01:43.156
They were actually Jews

00:01:43.357 --> 00:01:51.717
and they were instructed by Moses, Abraham,
all these people.

00:01:51.918 --> 00:01:57.631
But they had lost their moorings, and they
didn’t know what to seek,

00:01:57.832 --> 00:02:02.525
how to seek, and they were not seekers.

00:02:02.726 --> 00:02:08.961
They are quite satisfied with all the Jewish
ritualism they had

00:02:09.162 --> 00:02:15.235
as also in other religions we do the same.

00:02:15.436 --> 00:02:22.011
There was no seeking at all for anything
great.

00:02:22.917 --> 00:02:31.974
And so He had a very difficult life,
extremely difficult life.

00:02:34.055 --> 00:02:37.583
When He was born there was a sign,

00:02:37.784 --> 00:02:47.695
of a star which three men saw and they
followed it

00:02:47.927 --> 00:02:56.993
and reached that place where they found
that He was born in a manger,

00:02:57.194 --> 00:03:06.080
the very simple, simplest possible place
to be born.

00:03:08.614 --> 00:03:11.091
Was born in all great difficulties

00:03:11.292 --> 00:03:22.410
but it was shown clearly through a star
that He was something great.

00:03:22.611 --> 00:03:28.774
The other day somebody was asking Me,
"How did You find Ganapatipule?"

00:03:29.522 --> 00:03:35.471
Actually I didn’t know, and in Maharashtra
this is not a very well-known place.

00:03:35.672 --> 00:03:39.055
They go to Ashtavinayakas but not to this
Mahaganapati.

00:03:39.256 --> 00:03:42.034
They had no idea.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.564
But I was coming back from Ratnagiri

00:03:46.765 --> 00:03:53.647
and I saw really a very big star on top
of this temple.

00:03:54.181 --> 00:03:57.050
But nobody could see it, that’s
the problem is.

00:03:57.251 --> 00:03:59.958
At that time no sahaja yogis could see it.

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:07.438
So I told them, "Let us follow this star."
It was a very big, big one, unusually big,

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:15.408
not like a star, but quite a big, big star,
very unusual.

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:19.985
But they couldn’t see it. Other people who
were with Me

00:04:20.186 --> 00:04:23.935
they said that, “We can’t see it.”

00:04:25.176 --> 00:04:32.316
I said, “Doesn’t matter.” So I told them
to turn it,

00:04:32.517 --> 00:04:39.990
turn it from this Hadkamba they call it,
and let us go on this another road.

00:04:40.191 --> 00:04:47.904
And we just followed it. They, of course,
listened to Me, and they did not argue.

00:04:48.105 --> 00:04:51.225
And we were travelling, travelling, we were
quite late,

00:04:51.426 --> 00:04:56.294
but still I [said], “Doesn’t matter,
it’s alright, let’s go”.

00:04:56.495 --> 00:05:00.432
And by the time we reached Ganapatipule,

00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:04.820
it was the dawn, beautiful dawn, I can’t
forget that.

00:05:05.021 --> 00:05:13.304
And in that dawn we see such a beautiful
place here where we are now.

00:05:13.505 --> 00:05:18.634
And I said, “This is the place where we
have to be,

00:05:18.835 --> 00:05:24.330
where we have to get all the sahaja
yogis to.”

00:05:24.531 --> 00:05:29.455
Of course, you know that Rabindranath
Tagore has already described

00:05:29.656 --> 00:05:35.002
about this place that people will come here
from all over the world

00:05:35.203 --> 00:05:38.893
and at the shore of Bharat this will be
done.

00:05:39.094 --> 00:05:44.193
All these are predicted, have been done
already,

00:05:44.693 --> 00:05:50.556
but how miraculously I discovered this
place is very surprising

00:05:50.757 --> 00:05:55.411
as those three great men discovered Christ.

00:05:57.709 --> 00:06:06.038
And the place was really blessed and was
very beautifully vibrated.

00:06:06.898 --> 00:06:14.194
I stayed here for two days and I decided

00:06:14.395 --> 00:06:19.590
that this is the place we have to take.

00:06:19.791 --> 00:06:25.639
Ultimately we got this land and we got
all these things here.

00:06:27.006 --> 00:06:30.898
but people troubled us a lot.

00:06:31.331 --> 00:06:35.439
Such negative people they troubled us.

00:06:35.523 --> 00:06:42.199
Like Christ also was troubled and tortured, very much tortured by people.

00:06:43.115 --> 00:06:46.725
So at a very young age His parents took him away

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:50.411
and they say that they were in Kashmir.

00:06:52.631 --> 00:07:01.091
And then He came back from Kashmir later on,

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:08.376
is described in one of the books I’ve read about Christ being in Kashmir,

00:07:09.376 --> 00:07:11.743
where He met Shalivahana,

00:07:12.017 --> 00:07:15.539
I would say our forefather.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.709
Is very well described, and in Sanskrit it is written.

00:07:20.138 --> 00:07:23.529
I think the writer didn’t know what he was writing.

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:32.763
And the whole thing was the conversation between Christ and Shalivahan,

00:07:33.143 --> 00:07:39.903
and Christ told that “The country from where I come is spiritually dead.

00:07:42.271 --> 00:07:46.591
And the people are running after all filth and dirt.

00:07:47.404 --> 00:07:50.864
This is My country and I want to live here”.

00:07:52.809 --> 00:07:56.638
But Shalivahana told Him that, “You are such a great saint”.

00:07:56.763 --> 00:08:00.700
He also told His name, as Issa.

00:08:03.075 --> 00:08:06.106
“But You should go back to Your own country.

00:08:06.701 --> 00:08:09.333
You go over back to Your own country and”

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:13.184
– the word he has used – “You teach them Nirmala Tattwam,

00:08:13.443 --> 00:08:16.706
the principle of Nirmala”.

00:08:17.067 --> 00:08:20.128
Is clearly written in Sanskrit language.

00:08:21.496 --> 00:08:25.605
But He went there, and the people were so negative, so negative,

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:30.433
that they crucified Him just after three years.

00:08:32.857 --> 00:08:36.948
This is the sad story of His incarnation.

00:08:37.563 --> 00:08:42.575
But after that there were twelve disciples He had.

00:08:43.698 --> 00:08:47.623
And out of these twelve disciples the weakest was Peter.

00:08:48.855 --> 00:08:52.840
Very weak and he denied Christ thrice.

00:08:53.192 --> 00:08:56.239
And Christ had told him that,

00:08:56.264 --> 00:09:00.583
“ A satan will come and meet you”.

00:09:00.913 --> 00:09:03.489
It was Paul who met him.

00:09:04.093 --> 00:09:11.481
And the whole thing changed into a satanic anti-Christ force, as Catholic church.

00:09:12.442 --> 00:09:16.411
This Catholic church when I read about it I am shocked,

00:09:16.598 --> 00:09:22.098
how can a religious movement be such a criminal thing.

00:09:22.426 --> 00:09:27.151
It is absolutely criminal, it is anti-Christ.

00:09:27.261 --> 00:09:33.073
It has been making all money, everything, deceiving people,

00:09:33.417 --> 00:09:38.683
and brought what, nothing but their own kingdom.

00:09:39.831 --> 00:09:43.737
They live like saints to show,

00:09:43.792 --> 00:09:47.214
but all kinds of filth is going on in that Vatican,

00:09:47.239 --> 00:09:50.026
I have read another book recently.

00:09:50.051 --> 00:09:53.855
But I can’t imagine how can they call them Christians

00:09:53.941 --> 00:09:57.579
when Christ was innocence and purity.

00:09:58.408 --> 00:10:04.197
Such a shame in the name of God to do all these things.

00:10:04.799 --> 00:10:09.947
They also made artificial, we can say artificial

00:10:13.876 --> 00:10:21.764
notes and distributed them through their own bank,

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:26.204
they have a banking system, they have all kinds of things,

00:10:26.229 --> 00:10:30.626
I lived there, I know how terrible they are.

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:38.048
And this is what is the outcome of such
a great soul that sent by God.

00:10:38.892 --> 00:10:44.773
They changed the Bible also – not only that, but they tortured the Gnostics,

00:10:44.798 --> 00:10:50.984
the people, the early Christians who have had a religious experience.

00:10:52.476 --> 00:10:59.687
All nonsense they are doing morning till evening and
people are absolutely slavish about it.

00:11:02.171 --> 00:11:04.689
They are talking of conversion:

00:11:05.132 --> 00:11:09.009
what conversion has brought good to them?

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:14.399
In Italy there is mafia, there’s all kinds of nonsensical things

00:11:14.447 --> 00:11:23.149
and the Catholics are all full of sins and they have to just go and confess.

00:11:24.845 --> 00:11:31.970
When they are celebrating His millennium I was not at all very joyous about it,

00:11:32.631 --> 00:11:38.810
because this is another way to make money, to make money out of this festival.

00:11:39.568 --> 00:11:46.087
Actually Christ’s Birthday was not celebrated for 347 years,

00:11:46.524 --> 00:11:52.618
and they thought it’s a good idea to celebrate His birthday so that we can make lots of money.

00:11:53.282 --> 00:12:02.802
First of all they are all allowed to drink and be merry, all these systems started of immorality there.

00:12:03.029 --> 00:12:06.763
They also make a wine called Benedictine.

00:12:08.052 --> 00:12:12.513
They are making all kinds of things which are filthy and bad,

00:12:12.537 --> 00:12:15.427
and they have amassed so much of money with them

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:19.528
that no-one can challenge them and can ask them

00:12:19.841 --> 00:12:23.059
to get out of the lives of people, but is the people

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:27.656
who has seen it through and through and have given them up.

00:12:28.113 --> 00:12:31.128
This is the beauty of Christ.

00:12:31.222 --> 00:12:35.933
He has saved really these people, they were seekers of truth,

00:12:36.066 --> 00:12:42.408
and they have been able to take to Sahaj,

00:12:42.596 --> 00:12:45.299
to understand that there is truth in it, and we should not anymore cling on to something that is untruth. And now we have so many here who have been harmed and who have been tortured by this Catholic Church.

00:12:45.471 --> 00:12:50.002
and we should not anymore cling on to something that is untruth.

00:12:50.283 --> 00:12:59.392
And now we have so many here who have been harmed and who have been tortured by this Catholic Church.

00:12:59.791 --> 00:13:02.820
They are quite frightened of Sahaja Yoga I must tell you,

00:13:02.969 --> 00:13:06.726
they know that we are standing on the truth.

00:13:07.062 --> 00:13:11.359
They are very much frightened and they are trying their level best to harm us.

00:13:11.375 --> 00:13:15.499
But so far they have not done anything, they couldn’t achieve anything

00:13:15.734 --> 00:13:22.968
despite everything. At the end they had one argument through the newspaper about Sahaja Yoga

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:27.617
They said, ‘We don’t want to have one religion all over the world’.

00:13:27.916 --> 00:13:30.946
I said, ‘Yes, because how will you fight then?

00:13:30.986 --> 00:13:33.329
You must have many religions to fight’.

00:13:33.377 --> 00:13:34.720
Then they stopped.

00:13:34.822 --> 00:13:38.165
The newspaper they were arguing, they all stopped it.

00:13:38.502 --> 00:13:44.884
All these nonsensical ideas came, and it became so much

00:13:44.923 --> 00:13:50.235
of an extreme that people saw through it ‘This is wrong’,

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:54.460
and they really took to Sahaj.

00:13:56.094 --> 00:14:02.351
If there is no truth, why are they converting people all over the world?

00:14:02.789 --> 00:14:05.825
What have they achieved by conversion?

00:14:05.959 --> 00:14:14.553
And that is why one has to understand that all religions are equally the same.

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:21.576
In its manifestation may be different, but in its essence

00:14:21.601 --> 00:14:26.573
they all say that you have to have your self-realization.

00:14:26.941 --> 00:14:30.659
Whatever words, this way or that way,

00:14:30.823 --> 00:14:38.291
it has said you must seek the truth, in the Bible if you read – even, you’ll be amazed, in Koran

00:14:38.316 --> 00:14:43.964
though they have tried to camouflage lots of things, it has not been possible.

00:14:44.972 --> 00:14:49.135
Now Muslims also have taken up another view,

00:14:49.878 --> 00:14:52.581
worse than even Christians.

00:14:52.894 --> 00:14:55.393
That they are saying that

00:14:59.308 --> 00:15:04.518
Mohammed Sahib was the last incarnation.

00:15:04.956 --> 00:15:11.823
If He was so, there were so many others afterwards they may not accept:

00:15:11.964 --> 00:15:16.089
we had Guru Nanaka, we had Gyaneshwara,

00:15:16.206 --> 00:15:20.174
we had Shri Shirdi Sainath.

00:15:20.206 --> 00:15:23.081
How these prophets came on this earth?

00:15:23.159 --> 00:15:25.503
How can you deny it?

00:15:26.042 --> 00:15:28.557
If you say we don’t believe then you are stupid.

00:15:30.448 --> 00:15:34.846
Because if He was the last,
how did these incarnations came here?

00:15:37.056 --> 00:15:43.194
So many things Christ has said.
On the cross He said, “Behold the Mother”.

00:15:43.395 --> 00:15:54.023
Behold, is a very good word, meaning that
look forward, see the Mother.

00:15:54.357 --> 00:15:59.042
At the time of His death also He said this.

00:15:59.243 --> 00:16:07.841
And all these people are just trying
to create violence, torture,

00:16:08.042 --> 00:16:13.897
all kinds of things which cannot be Divine.

00:16:14.851 --> 00:16:19.923
So one has to understand that you cannot
spread any religion

00:16:20.124 --> 00:16:27.286
with violence, with force, you cannot.
Only with love and compassion.

00:16:27.487 --> 00:16:32.553
You can spread Sahaja Yoga only through
love and compassion.

00:16:32.754 --> 00:16:37.906
And that compassion is not a mental stuff

00:16:38.107 --> 00:16:42.020
that we think we are better than others
so we should change them.

00:16:42.221 --> 00:16:48.929
No. It is more love and compassion.

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:53.366
That you feel that we can really resurrect
people,

00:16:53.590 --> 00:17:00.492
not trying to change anything, but
to resurrect,

00:17:00.693 --> 00:17:04.411
as they are, we will resurrect them.

00:17:04.612 --> 00:17:10.060
This is our work: to resurrect people and
to give them the truth.

00:17:10.261 --> 00:17:14.573
There are many, many people all over
the world, and you have seen now,

00:17:14.774 --> 00:17:20.180
we are working in the 86 countries.
In a place like Benin

00:17:20.381 --> 00:17:24.095
we have got seven hundred sahaja yogis,
seven thousand, sorry,

00:17:24.296 --> 00:17:28.935
sahaja yogis, who were Muslims.

00:17:29.136 --> 00:17:33.704
And I asked them, "How did you take
to Sahaj?"

00:17:33.905 --> 00:17:36.429
He said, “Obvious.” I said, “Why?”

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:40.781
I said, “First of all, why did you become
Christians?”

00:17:40.982 --> 00:17:46.564
He said, “No, we didn’t. We just became
Muslims.” “But why?”

00:17:46.765 --> 00:17:54.335
“Because the French who were ruling there
were extremely immoral people,

00:17:54.536 --> 00:17:59.183
very immoral. And we thought, what’s
the use of following their religion,

00:17:59.384 --> 00:18:03.441
who drink all the time, and do all kinds
of filth,

00:18:03.642 --> 00:18:10.600
so how can we be better off? So we took
to Islam.”

00:18:10.801 --> 00:18:16.792
But they are now in Sahaja Yoga because
whatever it is

00:18:16.993 --> 00:18:22.438
they have discrimination. They are seekers
and they have discrimination.

00:18:22.639 --> 00:18:29.896
Imagine, they are all, we can call them
as people from the black, black people.

00:18:30.097 --> 00:18:33.965
But they have such enlightened mind, I was
amazed.

00:18:34.166 --> 00:18:38.678
They have made poems on Me, they have made
lots of things about Me,

00:18:38.879 --> 00:18:41.871
and seven thousand of them have become,

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:47.606
and they said one day the whole country
will become, sahaja yogis.

00:18:53.496 --> 00:18:57.799
In Turkey you know there is Islam,
so-called.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.345
But there was their leader Atatürk Kemal
Pasha, who was an enlightened soul

00:19:03.546 --> 00:19:08.835
and he talked to them that all this is
nonsense, this purdah system, this, that,

00:19:09.036 --> 00:19:11.395
oppression of women, all is nonsense.

00:19:11.596 --> 00:19:16.990
And he really made them much free. They
are extremely creative people there,

00:19:17.191 --> 00:19:23.471
and imagine, there are two thousand sahaja
yogis in Turkey.

00:19:23.664 --> 00:19:28.006
When there was this earthquake, you’ll be
amazed to know

00:19:28.207 --> 00:19:37.619
not one sahaja yogi was killed nor
anybody’s house was destroyed.

00:19:43.554 --> 00:19:50.045
In our country also we have four, four
states

00:19:50.246 --> 00:19:53.566
which were all converted into Catholicism.

00:19:53.767 --> 00:19:57.091
Now I have talked to them, and they said,
“No, these people only told us

00:19:57.292 --> 00:20:03.384
how to dress up well, go to church, sing
hymns and come back home.”

00:20:03.925 --> 00:20:09.398
I was surprised: they are dressed better,
no doubt, than other people,

00:20:09.583 --> 00:20:15.246
but how could they accept such a thing?
Because they are aboriginal,

00:20:15.447 --> 00:20:23.826
they are people who are not yet open
to light of the modern times or anything.

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:27.648
And then after that,

00:20:30.688 --> 00:20:38.556
after that, they were trying their hands
on Orissa.

00:20:40.083 --> 00:20:47.955
In Orissa there were already 35 to 40
persons who were Catholics.

00:20:48.672 --> 00:20:53.851
And I asked some sahaja yogis from
Australia

00:20:54.052 --> 00:20:57.817
to go and do some work there of Sahaja
Yoga.

00:20:58.018 --> 00:21:01.677
And they established nine centers there.

00:21:01.878 --> 00:21:04.879
Nine centers of Sahaja Yoga were
established.

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:12.680
But the best part of it, when there was
a huge big destruction

00:21:12.881 --> 00:21:17.883
through a hurricane that came,

00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:27.838
all the sahaja yogis who have newly
accepted Sahaja Yoga, are all safe.

00:21:30.554 --> 00:21:34.419
All their houses are safe.

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:38.955
So now what is going to come is the Last
Judgment.

00:21:39.156 --> 00:21:44.906
In that all people who still are trying
fundamentalism,

00:21:45.107 --> 00:21:49.149
who are fundamentalist, they’ll be
destroyed, I think so.

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:54.996
Because the way they are destroyed in all
these countries, I just don’t understand

00:21:55.197 --> 00:21:59.403
what is happening and why these people are
getting destroyed,

00:21:59.604 --> 00:22:05.282
their families destroyed, their houses
destroyed. Is the Kalki I think is acting,

00:22:05.483 --> 00:22:11.654
and working it out in all these places
in such a severe manner.

00:22:14.719 --> 00:22:19.513
Those people who do black magic and all
that, they were also destroyed.

00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:27.147
Is very surprising that in Orissa not one
sahaja yogi was hurt.

00:22:28.561 --> 00:22:35.802
It is such a big protection of the Divine
on sahaja yogis,

00:22:36.003 --> 00:22:40.567
which was to come, was told long time back
it was going to come.

00:22:40.768 --> 00:22:45.207
But people got lost in ritualism,
in the priesthood,

00:22:45.408 --> 00:22:50.385
and its all kinds of talks.

00:22:51.472 --> 00:22:55.676
By talking you cannot get a spiritual
experience,

00:22:55.877 --> 00:23:01.565
by reading you cannot get any spiritual
experience.

00:23:01.766 --> 00:23:07.681
Guru Nanaka has said it, Kabira has said it,
even Adi Shankaracharya has said

00:23:07.882 --> 00:23:14.322
that this is Shabda Jalam, this is the web
of words. “Oh Mother, take me out of that”.

00:23:14.523 --> 00:23:19.653
All these people who knew the truth have
said the same thing,

00:23:19.854 --> 00:23:24.635
they have repeated the same thing, if you
read their lives you’ll be surprised.

00:23:24.836 --> 00:23:31.983
Even the Sufis who were Muslims have
written the same thing all over.

00:23:32.184 --> 00:23:37.026
It’s surprising, how can Sufis living
in Turkey

00:23:37.227 --> 00:23:43.340
or living in, even they were in Pakistan –

00:23:43.541 --> 00:23:47.388
now is Pakistan, that time it was India –

00:23:47.589 --> 00:23:53.506
they all have written the same thing, some
great poets even from England

00:23:53.707 --> 00:24:01.917
have written the same thing, that truth
is truth, and truth is love.

00:24:02.118 --> 00:24:05.328
That’s what Christ wanted to establish,

00:24:05.529 --> 00:24:10.364
but He was born in a very, very difficult
situation.

00:24:10.565 --> 00:24:16.006
And the people who took over, as priests
and Church and all that,

00:24:16.207 --> 00:24:23.250
made full advantage of that and have really
oppressed all the people.

00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:29.552
There’s no oppression in Sahaja Yoga.
It’s your free will by which you come in.

00:24:29.753 --> 00:24:36.622
And you have to find the truth, truth about
yourself, you should know yourself.

00:24:36.823 --> 00:24:40.427
All the time Christ has said, “Know
Thyself.”

00:24:40.628 --> 00:24:43.615
And they don’t try that at all anywhere,
Knowing Thyself,

00:24:43.816 --> 00:24:47.291
because they don’t know themselves.

00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:55.549
This situation we have in every religion.

00:24:55.750 --> 00:25:03.261
They all came to fight it, to tell us
what is the right path what to follow.

00:25:03.462 --> 00:25:06.623
What Christ did was a very remarkable
thing,

00:25:06.824 --> 00:25:14.061
that He told the Jews that He is the Light,
He is the Path.

00:25:14.267 --> 00:25:17.665
But He didn’t say He was the destination,
clearly,

00:25:17.866 --> 00:25:22.353
because He knew that somebody has to come,

00:25:22.554 --> 00:25:27.222
and He said the Holy Ghost will come,

00:25:27.423 --> 00:25:30.702
and She’ll have three things as you know:

00:25:30.903 --> 00:25:37.425
that She’ll be a Comforter, She’ll be
a Counselor, and She’ll be a Redeemer.

00:25:37.626 --> 00:25:44.500
He didn’t use She or He, but in Hebrew
language it says “It”.

00:25:45.132 --> 00:25:50.287
So people have misused Bible to such
an extent that in England

00:25:50.488 --> 00:25:55.870
a king wanted to divorce his wife so he
authorized the Bible.

00:25:56.071 --> 00:26:02.367
How can such an adharmic fellow authorize
such a holy book like Bible?

00:26:02.603 --> 00:26:08.314
Because the power: with the power he want
to control,

00:26:08.514 --> 00:26:13.797
want to control all that is reality.

00:26:13.998 --> 00:26:16.587
This is a blind power.

00:26:16.788 --> 00:26:22.443
But if you have a real power, then you know
what to respect, what not to respect.

00:26:22.644 --> 00:26:24.783
Which way to go, which way not to go.

00:26:24.984 --> 00:26:32.838
Because you have a sight, you know a very
bright understanding of the whole thing.

00:26:33.039 --> 00:26:40.349
Which road you have to follow, where you
have to go, and which is the right thing.

00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:46.063
Thank God through this Kali Yuga, because
of all kinds of horrible things,

00:26:46.264 --> 00:26:51.631
as also among Hindus lots of funny, funny
rituals they have,

00:26:51.832 --> 00:26:58.620
that people have seen through that this is
not the end of it.

00:26:58.821 --> 00:27:02.363
You have to seek, you have to seek.

00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:08.396
But the only thing which is very important
is that all of them have said

00:27:08.597 --> 00:27:12.922
that you have to seek, you have to find out
your Self.

00:27:13.123 --> 00:27:18.040
Which is very clearly written in some
of the Indian scriptures.

00:27:18.241 --> 00:27:21.138
Some of them, I would say not all of them.

00:27:21.339 --> 00:27:24.539
Some of them it is written that you must
seek your Self,

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:29.535
specially the saints who came on this earth
in India,

00:27:29.736 --> 00:27:35.929
they have tried to say all the time that
you must seek,

00:27:36.130 --> 00:27:39.597
you must find out the truth. Because they
knew the truth

00:27:39.798 --> 00:27:42.796
and they wanted others to find the truth.

00:27:42.997 --> 00:27:46.877
So in every religion there have been
enlightened people.

00:27:47.078 --> 00:27:53.843
Among Buddhists also there has been
a Viditama, Lao-Tse, and many others,

00:27:54.044 --> 00:27:59.483
who have talked about seeking, seeking
the truth.

00:27:59.685 --> 00:28:03.849
Christ has said it very clearly, very, very
clearly,

00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:11.035
and at His birthday I feel very happy that
so many of you

00:28:11.236 --> 00:28:15.011
have already found out the truth and that
you know

00:28:15.212 --> 00:28:19.729
the path of love and compassion and
humility.

00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:24.774
As it is we know where Christ resides
within us,

00:28:24.975 --> 00:28:29.221
and how to respect Christ, and how
to worship it.

00:28:29.422 --> 00:28:32.991
With this Agnya chakra you can make out
a person

00:28:33.192 --> 00:28:41.838
whether he is a seeker or he is
a dominating arrogant Christian.

00:28:42.912 --> 00:28:46.562
You cannot do that, if you are a Christian
you cannot be that.

00:28:46.763 --> 00:28:49.414
If you are that, then you are not
a Christian.

00:28:49.615 --> 00:28:52.267
Look at Christ, how humble He was.

00:28:52.468 --> 00:28:57.226
He could have finished them off - He had
such powers - all of them;

00:28:57.427 --> 00:29:05.126
but He got Himself crucified. The reason
was Agnya chakra was to be broken.

00:29:05.327 --> 00:29:08.888
Was to be crossed. And so He accepted.

00:29:09.089 --> 00:29:12.188
As I told you He had all the powers
of Shri Ganesha,

00:29:12.389 --> 00:29:19.231
which are the most destructive powers.

00:29:19.432 --> 00:29:24.038
All these powers come from Mother Earth,

00:29:24.239 --> 00:29:28.582
and the Mother Earth can shake the whole
world.

00:29:28.783 --> 00:29:33.095
But He was the One who came as Mahavishnu,

00:29:33.283 --> 00:29:38.320
as described in the Devi Mahatmya. What
a person He was,

00:29:38.521 --> 00:29:43.122
and what He did, all His work is
beautifully described in Mahavishnu.

00:29:43.974 --> 00:29:50.856
Now, when they do not know, want to connect the Devi Mahatmya with Christ’s work,

00:29:51.294 --> 00:29:54.770
it’s alright, they are lost.

00:29:54.833 --> 00:29:59.544
There’s such a disintegration, and there’s no collectivity, nothing.

00:29:59.786 --> 00:30:05.994
And they call themselves as the disciples of Christ: you cannot.

00:30:06.581 --> 00:30:09.089
You must have love, compassion.

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:14.058
And not for a purpose. They have missionaries who go and

00:30:14.214 --> 00:30:20.665
talk of compassion, love, and what they achieve is nothing but conversion, because

00:30:20.697 --> 00:30:24.533
it is democracy and they want to have more heads.

00:30:24.613 --> 00:30:29.953
It’s so despising, the whole attitude towards Christ,

00:30:30.094 --> 00:30:35.273
is so criminal to have such an attitude towards Christ,

00:30:35.352 --> 00:30:39.522
who was the One who came to give salvation to the whole world,

00:30:40.053 --> 00:30:45.670
to unite the whole world, and to make so many different, different

00:30:45.694 --> 00:30:49.420
efforts to spoil His name.

00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:57.090
Now I would tell you this, that if Christ
is born and He came on this earth,

00:30:57.291 --> 00:30:59.918
it’s a very, very great occasion.

00:31:00.119 --> 00:31:03.237
He gave His life for us, He did everything.

00:31:03.438 --> 00:31:08.018
And how are we following Him is
by forgiving.

00:31:08.219 --> 00:31:13.961
You have to forgive others, you forgive
yourself and you forgive others.

00:31:14.162 --> 00:31:18.259
Is very important if you want to open this
Agnya chakra,

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:22.971
where resides our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:31:23.172 --> 00:31:26.483
If you cannot forgive others

00:31:26.684 --> 00:31:31.660
and you cannot forgive yourself, then this
Agnya won’t open.

00:31:31.861 --> 00:31:36.515
And the best part of it, all the Christian
nations I have seen,

00:31:36.724 --> 00:31:42.579
where there are so-called Christians, they
all have a very bad Agnya.

00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:48.418
If they are really following Christ, why
should there be a catch on the Agnya chakra?

00:31:48.619 --> 00:31:55.937
And they are extremely dominating, arrogant
people.

00:31:56.296 --> 00:32:02.125
They cannot be the disciples of Christ.
He was so humble,

00:32:02.326 --> 00:32:10.062
He was so much one with God Almighty, that
He accepted His crucifixion.

00:32:10.263 --> 00:32:15.260
His birth itself is a very great miracle,

00:32:15.461 --> 00:32:18.497
and His work is even greater.

00:32:18.698 --> 00:32:24.910
We have to win over all the Christians and
tell them what is real Christianity,

00:32:25.111 --> 00:32:28.751
what is reality, and what they should
take to,

00:32:28.952 --> 00:32:34.103
and how they should justify their following
of Christ.

00:32:34.304 --> 00:32:41.096
It is very big organizational thing, and
it’s a big, I mean, political thing,

00:32:41.297 --> 00:32:47.354
I mean, all kinds of things are going on.
And all the bad things they have

00:32:47.555 --> 00:32:51.878
from, say Hindu religion, they carry on.

00:32:52.101 --> 00:32:55.851
So what is the use of conversion also?

00:32:56.052 --> 00:33:03.366
So from His life we have to learn that
He took a birth

00:33:03.653 --> 00:33:10.906
in such a situation that nobody would have
dared to be born like that.

00:33:11.107 --> 00:33:16.730
So much of darkness and ignorance, so much
of cruelty,

00:33:16.931 --> 00:33:21.902
that He took His birth at that time is
extremely remarkable.

00:33:22.103 --> 00:33:25.730
Such a brave, courageous personality.

00:33:25.954 --> 00:33:29.434
Nowadays they make Christ look like
a TB patient, I mean,

00:33:29.635 --> 00:33:36.439
just to beg, you know. Because they are
beggars. All the time they are begging.

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:43.153
And I was in Bombay this time, some little,
little girls and boys were singing songs

00:33:43.354 --> 00:33:47.247
and they came up, and they said, “Give us
some money.”

00:33:47.448 --> 00:33:50.004
I said, “What are you doing?”
“We are singing carols.”

00:33:50.205 --> 00:33:53.181
“So you sing! Why do you need money for?”

00:33:53.382 --> 00:33:58.336
“You know, we need money, we have no food
to eat.” Imagine.

00:33:58.537 --> 00:34:03.915
Then why sing songs of Christ?

00:34:04.806 --> 00:34:11.664
All kinds of begging is done. Christ, did
He beg for anything?

00:34:11.865 --> 00:34:15.553
Did He want to create beggars on this
earth?

00:34:15.754 --> 00:34:20.980
He died, lived with self-respect.

00:34:21.181 --> 00:34:26.064
All His qualities are never studied and
people take

00:34:26.265 --> 00:34:35.362
to something which is very mundane,
sometimes absolutely degrading, degrading.

00:34:35.563 --> 00:34:41.230
He came to give us a very dharmic,

00:34:41.439 --> 00:34:46.449
very… I shouldn’t say religious because
that's different meaning,

00:34:46.650 --> 00:34:52.585
but I would say a very pious and beautiful
life.

00:34:52.786 --> 00:34:56.787
He is the model, He is the model we have
to follow.

00:34:57.364 --> 00:35:02.254
Not that to become beggars and go round and ask for alms.

00:35:02.755 --> 00:35:08.106
Even in the schools which are Christian schools they teach this to children, that

00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:11.059
you go and ask for money, ask for money;

00:35:11.084 --> 00:35:13.473
all over the world they are asking for money.

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:16.473
And what do they do with their money God only knows.

00:35:16.536 --> 00:35:22.254
Money can never be so important, never so important

00:35:22.518 --> 00:35:30.040
– it is just that we use it, but it cannot dominate us.

00:35:32.267 --> 00:35:36.900
He came in a very, very humble way, in a manger He was born,

00:35:37.088 --> 00:35:39.554
to show that money is not important.

00:35:41.236 --> 00:35:51.298
Though in the Sanskrit literature it is written that a God, or God Almighty when He incarnates,

00:35:51.611 --> 00:35:59.611
He has aishwarya, means He has wealth,
He must have wealth.

00:36:00.709 --> 00:36:04.201
It is meaning the spiritual wealth.

00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:07.740
He must be born with the spiritual wealth.

00:36:07.958 --> 00:36:13.498
If he has spiritual wealth, then He is the real incarnation.

00:36:14.115 --> 00:36:18.394
If you don’t have the spiritual wealth of love and compassion,

00:36:18.825 --> 00:36:24.043
and detachment, you cannot be called as an incarnation.

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:31.043
It’s a myth. So we have to test it on people who are saying they are incarnations,

00:36:31.067 --> 00:36:35.238
they are gods, they are divine, that they will take you to divine life.

00:36:35.262 --> 00:36:37.777
See their own lives, how they live.

00:36:38.989 --> 00:36:41.129
See their own temperament.

00:36:42.641 --> 00:36:45.383
You can see how Christ knew about:

00:36:45.448 --> 00:36:49.875
He told Peter that you’ll meet a satan.

00:36:50.290 --> 00:36:52.690
And that’s what he met, this Paul.

00:36:53.595 --> 00:37:02.890
In every incarnation’s life there has been negative force curbing the activity of that incarnation.

00:37:03.328 --> 00:37:09.132
We too had lots of negative forces, but gradually we have surmounted it

00:37:09.226 --> 00:37:16.116
and still I am there living, it’s no, there’s no crucifixion for Me at least.

00:37:16.968 --> 00:37:24.968
So this is what it is, because you are seekers and you have found the truth.

00:37:26.031 --> 00:37:31.382
This was My job, is to give you the truth. And you have got it,

00:37:31.585 --> 00:37:37.163
you have got the spiritual experience, which is the greatest thing one can ask for.

00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:41.560
You know yourself and you are so one with each other.

00:37:41.803 --> 00:37:47.691
This is the completion of the work of Christ, that He said ‘I will send you the Holy Ghost’.

00:37:48.225 --> 00:37:54.497
So this millennium for Me is mixed with funny feelings,

00:37:54.560 --> 00:38:00.224
because all created by this Catholic Church, saying ‘this is the Millennium’.

00:38:00.584 --> 00:38:02.013
Who says so?

00:38:03.529 --> 00:38:10.692
Because it is already not was celebrated for four hundred and something, forty-seven years,

00:38:10.708 --> 00:38:17.098
and now you say ‘this is millennium’. So the whole world has said, ‘Now is millennium, millennium, millennium’.

00:38:18.036 --> 00:38:24.942
If it is, if it is really the millennium, then what Christ wanted to do

00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:32.591
is to take a hunter in His hand and hit all the people who are negative or making money in the name of God.

00:38:37.661 --> 00:38:42.044
I am unhappy because is created by Catholic Church.

00:38:42.154 --> 00:38:46.839
They have already made so much money out of Christ,

00:38:46.864 --> 00:38:56.273
out of His name, and if you meet people say in Brazil, or Argentina, of Peru and all these places,

00:38:56.359 --> 00:39:03.046
wherever there is Catholicism, they are very, very poor people.

00:39:03.078 --> 00:39:10.687
Catholics are mostly very poor, except in Switzerland I think, where they must, they have banks, maybe that is the reason.

00:39:11.445 --> 00:39:15.881
Even these banking people are all Catholics.

00:39:17.069 --> 00:39:19.326
Can you imagine?

00:39:20.498 --> 00:39:26.670
And Italy also has lots of it, but now, Italians are that way much more open,

00:39:28.059 --> 00:39:39.505
much more open and they have been attacking by so many ways this Catholic Church.

00:39:39.576 --> 00:39:49.154
France I don’t know, France partly, they are not yet so many, but one day will come this France will have to learn a lesson,

00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:53.007
a very serious lesson for whatever they are doing.

00:39:53.235 --> 00:39:57.976
They don’t know what is freedom is, actually they don’t know laws.

00:39:58.070 --> 00:40:00.615
They are going at random like mad people.

00:40:00.694 --> 00:40:02.761
Firstly they drink such a lot.

00:40:03.225 --> 00:40:05.834
Drinking according to them is allowed.

00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:12.428
How can it be allowed, drinking, which is the greatest curse on human beings?

00:40:12.648 --> 00:40:19.717
They said that He went for a wedding and in the wedding He created wine.

00:40:19.771 --> 00:40:25.029
In Hebrew language wine means the grape juice.

00:40:27.271 --> 00:40:29.534
Not wine which is fermented.

00:40:29.714 --> 00:40:33.261
And instantly, how can you create wine?

00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:38.198
There’s no logic. You have to ferment it, you have to rot it.

00:40:38.839 --> 00:40:42.019
But the Christians are the worst in this.

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:44.360
If somebody dies they will drink.

00:40:45.128 --> 00:40:48.105
If somebody’s born, they will drink.

00:40:48.175 --> 00:40:52.465
Anything that happens, whether good or bad, they will drink.

00:40:52.575 --> 00:40:55.887
Drinking is their religion, specially in France.

00:40:55.965 --> 00:40:58.784
Now they have no money, French have no money,

00:40:58.808 --> 00:41:03.440
because this drinking business takes out all your money, everything.

00:41:05.987 --> 00:41:09.737
Christ never said you should drink. Why will He say?

00:41:09.784 --> 00:41:13.354
It goes against your awareness, must understand,

00:41:13.386 --> 00:41:21.831
you can’t bring such a bad name to Him saying that He had agreed to people who were drinking.

00:41:21.847 --> 00:41:28.782
No, never. He cannot. He was an incarnation of purity:

00:41:29.236 --> 00:41:31.236
how will He say such a thing?

00:41:31.251 --> 00:41:38.727
I can’t understand the licentiousness, the immorality that people are doing.

00:41:39.181 --> 00:41:42.445
They’ll go to church, come back and become immoral.

00:41:43.017 --> 00:41:50.665
There’s no restriction on them, because they don’t know, because there is no light,

00:41:50.751 --> 00:41:58.595
light of the Spirit in them, to see what is destructive and what is constructive.

00:41:58.759 --> 00:42:07.595
That’s why Christ came on this world to show, and they put all these things on Him, and take a license to do whatever they like.

00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:13.029
After Sahaja Yoga you realize what is
wrong, what is good.

00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:21.022
Unless and until you become a sahaja yogi
is difficult to have this discrimination.

00:42:21.223 --> 00:42:25.068
That’s how so many people are lost
in the name of Christ,

00:42:25.269 --> 00:42:31.724
lost in the destructive forces of their
being.

00:42:31.925 --> 00:42:40.567
As it is we call them all the six enemies
that we have.

00:42:41.306 --> 00:42:45.533
So today, when we remember His life,

00:42:47.638 --> 00:42:55.419
His birth, His work, His greatness,
His sacrifice,

00:42:55.620 --> 00:43:00.489
we have to know that we have to follow
His life.

00:43:00.690 --> 00:43:03.276
He is our model,

00:43:03.461 --> 00:43:10.830
we have to bear lots of things, we have
to be tolerant, we cannot be aggressive,

00:43:12.025 --> 00:43:17.522
we cannot be threat to the freedom
of others.

00:43:17.723 --> 00:43:20.533
I know there’s some are satanic people,

00:43:20.734 --> 00:43:25.544
but we should not be a threat to them.
Our truth will fight.

00:43:25.745 --> 00:43:31.229
This is a very, very simple thing we have
to do.

00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:36.149
In Sahaja Yoga see, I have seen people have
taken more

00:43:36.350 --> 00:43:41.739
to a very moral life, and a moral behavior,

00:43:41.947 --> 00:43:48.087
and a whole culture also. Sahaja Yoga
culture

00:43:48.288 --> 00:43:55.770
is a very moral culture, very loving
culture, very compassionate culture.

00:43:55.986 --> 00:44:02.794
And I am sure Christ within you will be
happy to see you in this manner.

00:44:02.995 --> 00:44:05.986
May God bless you.
