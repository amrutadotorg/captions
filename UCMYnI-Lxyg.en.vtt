00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:07.999
Shri Diwali Puja,Temisoara - Romania
25th October 1992.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.490
I think they all understand Russian. Great.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.410
The Diwali Puja.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.790
Can you all hear?

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.450
Ask them can they hear.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.410
Again say. Again translate.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.370
They can't hear.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.330
You again say that: today we are celebrating ...

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.410
All right.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.490
Just find out if they can hear you.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.910
I think you all can try to learn English

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.200
which is a very simple language

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.750
and would be better.

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:52.490
Sit down, sit here.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.450
Yes. Just sit facing Me here, facing Me,

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.500
facing towards Me. Hello.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.450
Just facing towards Me if you sit, it is better.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.490
No, that's all right. Now come. It's all right.

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.580
Facing towards Me, not towards them.

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.490
Face towards Me. Just face.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.490
Yes, there is seats here.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.660
I just want to say that you all can learn English language,

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.490
it's not difficult, from My tapes.

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:37.580
From My tapes.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:44.370
They can learn, try to learn, this language from My tapes.

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.580
If you sit facing Me, you will ...

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.410
Just face Me, then it's better.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.490
Completely face Me, don't sit with the angle.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.160
Yes it's all right.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.660
Now... Can you say?

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.500
Of course the language of love is universal,

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:40.000
for it has no script, that's the problem,

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.830
and no words.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.200
Yogini: Shri Mataji, I'm sorry.  I'm so ...

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.160
Tired.

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:07.660
Yogini:  Not tired.  Full of emotions.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:09.620
Too full of emotions.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.660
Can't to catch Your words, you see.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.490
Mix everything, all languages in my head.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.490
May ask someone to translate.

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.490
I feel like I cannot catch the words

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.620
No you'll be all right. Come along.

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.490
I don't know how to express,

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.620
I am also full of lots of emotions.

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:10.290
It's such a beautiful gathering we have here

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.120
from all over the world.

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:26.500
We are all bound together in such pure love.

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:46.870
And Russians also have arrived, luckily.

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.950
They had to go through some tapasya.

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:12.910
The significance of Diwali is spread out in about five days.

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:30.490
Yogi:  Shri Mataji, Svetlana from Leningrad is here.

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:33.410
She's there?  Svetlana, come along.

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:35.490
Are you all right?

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:01.870
Take it easy.

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:27.620
And they are all together, somehow.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:31.580
These five days are all put together.

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:42.870
So they have different aspects,

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:55.790
but in every aspect there's one common point,

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.490
is that the Goddess is that the Goddess plays the main role.

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:16.490
Now the first day is the worship of the housewife,

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:29.120
where you have to buy some sort of a utensil for the

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.200
kitchen or for the use of the wife,

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:33.490
or could be a present for the wife.

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:49.620
But is said that women must be respected,

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:53.160
but they should be respectable.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.490
If they are not respectable, how can they be respected?

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:09.660
Now I have to warn you all people to be careful with

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:12.080
the Western influence.

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:23.500
In the Western influence, money has become everything.

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:26.750
Yogini: Mother, sorry, he did not translate into Romanian.

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:29.490
Yogini: He did not translate into Romanian.

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:30.660
What are you saying?

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:33.870
Yogini: He did not translate into Romanian.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:34.910
I am only translating.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.540
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:56.580
Because in the West, money has become everything.

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:07.490
The morality, the character,

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:11.540
all the value system is all finished,

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:22.660
so we as Sahaja yogis have to stop all that.

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:37.490
Done it?

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:38.950
Yogini: He translated.

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:42.450
Let him do first, and then you do it. It's easier for Me.

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:52.000
Now the first thing we have to understand that

00:12:52.490 --> 00:13:00.490
the society is completely dependent on the Gruha Lakshmis,

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:20.410
that means a housewife has to be a very lady

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:24.120
of great character, respectability and dignity.

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:34.620
Society is her responsibility.

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:51.450
She's responsible for creating peace, understanding,

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:56.000
and for giving full idea as to what is love.

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:15.410
I think her responsibility is much more difficult, subtler,

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:17.750
than that of men,

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:32.910
and she's the shakti of the family,

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:44.490
so she should not try to behave in a manner

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:48.750
that is not dignified or matured.

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:03.490
Say for example,

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:07.910
every woman wants to become the mother,

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:20.200
but in the Western country many women don't want.

00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:31.500
Specially in America,

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:40.200
because they think by that their body will be spoiled

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:42.620
or something will happen that

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:45.830
may their husbands may not be attracted towards them.

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:02.200
So there's all the time the mad race going on

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:04.200
between husband and wife.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.580
Husband is running after many women

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:17.790
and many women are,

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:22.250
the women are also running after men,

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:38.870
or they dominate their husband.

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:51.490
In this mad race the children are neglected,

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:54.950
the household is neglected and there's always quarrel

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.830
going on between the two.

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:22.490
So women should not try to be so subservient

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:25.950
about this kind of mad race.

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:37.370
They should keep their dignity,

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:39.410
they should keep their character.

00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:41.700
They should look after their children,

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:44.410
not bothering about their husbands.

00:17:57.790 --> 00:18:03.580
Now the worst thing that is very much acceptedis a divorce,

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:07.120
and so the men they are afraid that men will divorce them

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:08.620
and they'll be left in the lurch.

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:24.040
But always in the West there is a provision,

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:27.540
if a husband marries some other woman or something,

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:31.700
children and the mother are given sufficient money

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:32.870
to look after them.

00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:55.490
Under such circumstances the women should try

00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:58.080
to correct their husbands and fight for it,

00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:01.080
but, if they do not come round

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:02.830
they should get completely detached.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.370
If the husband wants to go to hell, let him go.

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:18.160
Why do you want to do the same?

00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:33.490
After all you have your dharma,

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:35.660
you have your own life

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:39.200
and you should just worry about yourself,

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:43.580
and if he doesn't understand you, forget it.

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:05.490
Such a irresponsible and a stupid fellow

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:07.830
should be just pitied,

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:21.330
but one should not follow the footsteps of the husband,

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:31.660
because you have a much wider responsibility.

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:45.410
One should not try to look younger

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:49.490
and just all the time make your life miserable

00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:53.790
by trying to keep your husband attached to you,

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:14.000
because by that you will lose your powers, your shakti.

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:26.490
But if your husband is a man of character

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:27.660
then you must respect him

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:29.790
and support him in every way,

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:44.750
and tolerate him as far as possible.

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:56.290
Yesterday I saw many ladies have cut their hair.

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:06.540
Please do not play into the hands of these entrepreneurs,

00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:21.580
they know how to ...befool you.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:32.750
I have seen horrible things happening because

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:38.620
these entrepreneurs try to entice by advertisement.

00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:54.080
Recently in Paris they said

00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:56.750
we should have six inches of skirts,

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:09.540
and nowhere we could get long skirts.

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:17.410
Imagine in all these cold countries

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:20.870
so many have got varicose veins.

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:40.750
They start styles for hair, for body, for faces,

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:43.700
they start all kinds of nonsense, but Sahaja yogis

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.410
Sahaja yoginis should understand what are they up to.

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:14.450
You should not fall into their traps at all.

00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:24.410
So you are the goddess of the family,

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:28.660
you have the shakti and you have to be very careful.

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:46.290
Moreover you are Sahaja yoginis,

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.080
so you shouldn't allow your Sahasrara

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:50.830
to be touched by anyone.

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:01.950
And your power comes from your chastity.

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:13.000
Thousands of women in India committed suicide

00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:15.660
because they didn't want any man to touch their body.

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:33.080
Now you are in Sahaja culture,

00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:35.830
and in Sahaja culture we have to behave

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:39.450
in a very dignified, matured manner.

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:58.330
When you are small girls you are also goddesses,

00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:01.040
that time you are innocent.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.080
Then you get married.

00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:20.410
It's a very big thing that you are a married woman,

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:21.750
is very auspicious.

00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:38.450
Then after marriage you have children.

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:42.910
It's even, even greater honor for you,

00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:55.620
because you are mothers.

00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:02.870
We are not actresses,

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:09.490
we are mothers

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:16.620
and you should be proud of being a mother,

00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:25.830
and you should be proud of your children.

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:34.950
Then you become grandmothers.

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:41.870
I think this is a very great achievement

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.490
and you should feel very proud of your age,

00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:01.040
that you are a grandmother.

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:10.540
If you will go on struggling for looking young,

00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:12.330
you'll look very old.

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:28.700
You'll see your Mother is seventy years of age

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:32.450
and I don't look My age, that's what they say.

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:48.450
I have never bothered about My looks.

00:28:57.620 --> 00:28:59.490
I have no time,

00:29:00.490 --> 00:29:02.490
I have so many children.

00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:06.250
I have no time, I have so many children.

00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:17.080
And I'm very proud of My age also.

00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:32.200
With age you grow, you mature, you are wiser,

00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:44.580
then you have all the assets of your personality.

00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:56.200
If you really respect your age

00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:59.620
people will come to you for advice, help,

00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:01.830
and then you can spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:22.910
There are so many complications with these

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:26.290
entrepreneurs the way they try to exploit women.

00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:43.620
On a Diwali day I don't want to talk about that,

00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:56.950
so I'll try to tell you about the Lakshmi,

00:30:57.330 --> 00:30:58.750
the symbol of Lakshmi.

00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:15.160
Shri Lakshmi is the symbol of the completeness of womanhood.

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:31.580
She brings wealth, prosperity, auspiciousness.

00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:44.490
She brings in understanding,

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:50.790
generosity, peace and joy.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.040
She is the giver of all the blessings.

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:18.410
The symbol of Lakshmi is that She stands on the lotus

00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:20.120
which is pink in color.

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:36.200
Pink color is the warmth of a motherhood.

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:50.250
In India even a small girl is called as "mother".

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:06.700
So, in the various aspects of Lakshmi, the symbol is that

00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:10.870
first She is a very warm person;

00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:28.120
also in one hand She has the lotus

00:33:37.330 --> 00:33:39.700
which is also pink in color,

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:52.950
that also suggestive of Her warmth.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:06.080
Even a funny type of a moth with all kinds of thorns

00:34:06.490 --> 00:34:08.450
attached to his body

00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:11.750
enters into a lotus, he finds a place

00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:13.410
where he can rest.

00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:36.660
She makes all the guests to come in her house and

00:34:36.910 --> 00:34:41.250
have the best bed and the best food.

00:34:55.490 --> 00:35:02.950
Normally the men bring in a guest and the wife

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:06.250
receives him and looks after him.

00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:27.500
So, it is suggestive that we have to look after

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:30.450
any type of a guest who comes to our house,

00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:33.450
and should completely

00:35:34.410 --> 00:35:39.250
devote ourselves to the looking after of the guest

00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:41.080
who is from outside.

00:35:58.370 --> 00:36:03.750
She is standing on the lotus and wearing also a pink sari.

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:17.950
That is, you have to have balance

00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:20.040
to stand on a thing like lotus

00:36:27.490 --> 00:36:30.250
because She's surrounded by water,

00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:49.700
and there are many animals around it;

00:36:55.910 --> 00:37:00.910
beast-like people who try to entice Her,

00:37:07.250 --> 00:37:11.250
so She has to have a complete balance.

00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:27.080
Also She has two hands with the lotus

00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:32.910
and with two other hands She is giving,

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:36.540
and with another hand She's blessing.

00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:59.290
This one means that she should be generous,

00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:03.370
she should be giving always to others, not for herself.

00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:13.750
She should not spend all the money on herself

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:17.500
and nothing for the children or for the guests or for others.

00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:31.450
So it is the Lakshmi who has to give,

00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:32.910
who has to be generous.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000
I have seen those people in Sahaja Yoga are generous,

00:38:50.410 --> 00:38:54.490
their wives may not be, and then they suffer a lot.

00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:14.370
But if the wife is generous, she's rewarded,

00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:16.700
the whole family is rewarded hundred times.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.920
Generosity is like this, that you have one door open

00:39:37.170 --> 00:39:39.040
through which everything is coming in,

00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:43.460
and you open another door by giving,

00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:45.590
so there's a very good circulation.

00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:17.670
I enjoy My generosity the most, if it is generosity,

00:40:37.090 --> 00:40:41.040
and you all should enjoy this generosity,

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:53.300
and generosity is so rewarding,

00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:58.130
so rewarding that it is unbelievable

00:40:58.340 --> 00:41:03.550
how the divine forces help a person who is generous.

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:25.800
I'll give an example.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.880
I had a friend

00:41:28.170 --> 00:41:31.300
who said she wanted a sari from the foreign countries,

00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:33.040
these imported saris;

00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:54.210
and I had two of them and I told a another lady

00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:55.920
who was very miserly that

00:41:56.130 --> 00:41:58.550
I would like to give away these two saris to her.

00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:11.550
So she said, "You have only these two left now,

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:13.130
why do You want to give her this sari?"

00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:15.090
She was miserly type.

00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:30.380
We were talking in the kitchen,

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:48.800
but somebody rang the bell and I opened the door.

00:42:57.710 --> 00:43:03.300
He had brought two saris from Africa,

00:43:03.550 --> 00:43:09.130
because some lady who had gone to Africa had sent them.

00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:26.670
So I said, "Why did she send Me saris?"

00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:30.300
He said, "Because You had given her saris when

00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:32.340
she went, so she has sent You these."

00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:51.500
And when I opened the saris they were exactly the same,

00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:53.170
the ones I had with Me.

00:44:10.170 --> 00:44:13.170
So I took out both the saris and showed her,

00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:16.000
"See, this is the example."

00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:31.380
This is how it is, always.

00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:36.340
Everything comes back to you when you are kind

00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:39.250
to others, or if you are generous to others.

00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:59.090
You will find later on yourself, and so many have already

00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:02.420
found that just money flows to them.

00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:19.090
They can't understand from where the money is coming.

00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:30.090
Just it works out that you get money,

00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:40.630
whenever you want.

00:45:45.130 --> 00:45:47.420
You should not worry about money.

00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:56.040
Just forget it and it comes to you.

00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:08.210
People who are meticulously counting their money

00:46:08.550 --> 00:46:10.250
all the time, every morning,

00:46:18.670 --> 00:46:21.300
are never satisfied and also

00:46:21.550 --> 00:46:24.550
they haven't got the blessings of any kind.

00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:42.000
But if you'll just keep the worry of money to God,

00:46:42.130 --> 00:46:43.800
everything works out.

00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:59.670
So what do we understand?

00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:03.170
That it is all in the hands of God Almighty.

00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:16.630
After coming to Sahaja Yoga

00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:20.050
you don't have to worry about anything.

00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:22.090
Leave it in the hands of God

00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:39.170
and everything will work out.

00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:52.170
There is no need for you to go on telling people that

00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:54.630
"Oh, I am so much worried, I have no money,

00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:55.840
I have no money."

00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:09.420
That shows that you are not yet Sahaja yogis.

00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:22.880
So, if you have to improve those who are your neighbors

00:48:23.130 --> 00:48:24.960
or your friends or your country,

00:48:25.130 --> 00:48:29.170
first of all you have to be very mature Sahaja yoginis.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:53.590
So the Lakshmi is already awakened within you.

00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:06.300
She resides in your Nabhi Chakra.

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.210
So with your Lakshmi awakened,

00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:20.210
why should you worry about money?

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:43.800
So then, this last, Her symbolic hand She says that

00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:46.170
"Those who are under your protection,

00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:47.460
you must look after them."

00:50:15.130 --> 00:50:19.250
That means you have to bless everyone

00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:20.750
who comes in contact with you,

00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:35.630
and you have to worry about all the people

00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:37.960
who are under your control.

00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:53.300
So the Lakshmi symbol is not only for the ladies,

00:50:53.590 --> 00:50:55.550
but more for the men.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:10.920
A man who is in the business

00:51:11.090 --> 00:51:12.880
has to respect his wife and

00:51:13.090 --> 00:51:14.250
his wife should be respectable.

00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:29.000
If she is not,

00:51:29.460 --> 00:51:32.500
then auspiciousness will not come in that family.

00:51:45.130 --> 00:51:49.210
So, you get all these blessings of Lakshmi

00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:53.300
if your housewife is good person.

00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:19.170
This symbol of Lakshmi is expressing a kind of

00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:28.460
a personality that is expected of a woman or a man

00:52:28.750 --> 00:52:32.590
who have got the blessings of money.

00:52:57.710 --> 00:53:01.670
So, that is the -- I was telling you about the first day

00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:04.000
what is it, second day what is it,

00:53:04.420 --> 00:53:08.500
but main thing is that on a Diwali day

00:53:08.750 --> 00:53:11.340
we have to worship the Lakshmi.

00:53:33.210 --> 00:53:36.130
So, today when we are worshipping Lakshmi,

00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:39.880
the men also have to know that they have to have

00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:42.040
a complete balance in life,

00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:53.840
that they should be generous and look after the people

00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:56.300
who are under their control.

00:54:09.380 --> 00:54:15.130
So the there are, as I said, many aspects,

00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:17.630
but one of them, very important is that

00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:24.380
Shri Rama killed Ravanna on ten days before they say,

00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:29.630
and was crowned on the ...

00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:33.590
I mean today. He was crowned today.

00:54:54.670 --> 00:55:01.000
So His wife was Sita, She was also made the Queen,

00:55:01.300 --> 00:55:07.550
and in their life it is shown how She remained

00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:09.920
absolutely dedicated to Him.

00:55:33.250 --> 00:55:39.420
So in Sahaja culture we have to be special people.

00:55:49.420 --> 00:55:53.300
We cannot be like other people who are just running after

00:55:53.550 --> 00:55:58.800
money and doing everything just to ruin themselves.

00:56:14.380 --> 00:56:19.130
So that, in Sahaja culture we have to meditate,

00:56:19.420 --> 00:56:23.340
get our satisfaction about everything within ourselves,

00:56:23.630 --> 00:56:29.380
and also we have to be like the Lakshmi children,

00:56:29.670 --> 00:56:30.670
the children of Lakshmi.

00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:54.040
So there are two aspects of this thing we have understood

00:56:54.050 --> 00:56:59.050
is that Lakshmi fulfils all our monetary needs,

00:56:59.710 --> 00:57:06.040
plus also She gives us all the balance, all the joy,

00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:08.460
all the bliss in the family.

00:57:34.710 --> 00:57:42.630
Now the problem is with us that unless and until we

00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:46.840
meditate, unless and until we reach that state of

00:57:47.050 --> 00:57:52.000
satisfaction, we cannot see the work of this divine power.

00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:20.920
If all the people from Eastern countries could worship

00:58:21.630 --> 00:58:27.550
the Lakshmi or you can say worship their own Kundalini,

00:58:28.210 --> 00:58:36.130
then whole of this problem of money will be solved;

00:58:58.040 --> 00:59:02.300
and such a change will come that those countries which

00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:05.630
today do appear to be poorer than the rest

00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:07.500
of the European world,

00:59:07.710 --> 00:59:12.040
will become quite rich by the blessings of Shri Lakshmi.

00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:51.750
Now I have to take you to a very subtler side of life,

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:12.800
and that subtler side is that with the blessings

01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:17.840
of Shri Lakshmi or Mahalakshmi, now you have achieved

01:00:18.090 --> 01:00:20.040
your Self-realization.

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:45.710
The Mahalakshmi Principle has given you this ascent,

01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:08.750
and the Mahalakshmi Principle is that you rise much above

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:14.130
your mundane life into the realm of Self-realization.

01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:38.500
So by Her blessings you become like lotuses yourselves.

01:01:49.750 --> 01:01:54.000
Now you become the another aspect of Diwali,

01:01:54.250 --> 01:01:57.590
which means "the rows of lights".

01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:22.840
Shri Rama's crowning or any other aspect of Shri Lakshmi

01:02:23.170 --> 01:02:28.170
here now becomes your own crowning.

01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:40.710
That is, you have now entered into the Kingdom of God,

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:57.380
and once you are there then automatically, as the citizens

01:02:57.590 --> 01:03:01.420
of God's Kingdom, you are blessed.

01:03:17.670 --> 01:03:22.920
And as you become the lotuses then you start spreading

01:03:23.130 --> 01:03:25.210
your fragrance all around.

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:43.170
Now you do not keep this joy to yourself

01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:45.250
but you become generous about you,

01:03:45.550 --> 01:03:48.460
and you go all out to give it to others.

01:04:07.550 --> 01:04:13.460
The generosity at another level, at a lower level,

01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:18.590
is transformed into this universal love.

01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:36.880
Whatever you gain, whatever joy, satisfaction, vibrations,

01:04:37.550 --> 01:04:41.630
knowledge, all that you want to give it to others.

01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:03.630
You want to spread it because now you've got the reality

01:05:04.050 --> 01:05:05.800
and you don't want to keep it to yourself,

01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:09.840
you think it is very important that everyone in the world

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:11.840
should know about Reality.

01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:34.840
This is significant in putting these lights,

01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:37.550
that now you are the lights.

01:05:53.380 --> 01:05:56.340
It is the darkest night today.

01:05:57.670 --> 01:06:00.840
Tonight is the darkest night.

01:06:07.170 --> 01:06:13.050
In the same way these are the darkest days.

01:06:16.050 --> 01:06:17.550
The darkest days.

01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:28.420
Darkest.

01:06:31.750 --> 01:06:36.050
This is the Kali Yuga and it is the ghor Kali Yuga,

01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:38.000
means worst time,

01:06:45.170 --> 01:06:47.040
when the worst things are happening,

01:06:47.210 --> 01:06:50.710
human beings are going to the worst level.

01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:06.840
And at this time we have to put Sahaja Yoga before them.

01:07:15.670 --> 01:07:22.630
You know what is the ordeal one has to go through

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.590
to break the hard nuts of the brains of people.

01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:50.590
But it is working, it has clicked already.

01:07:52.460 --> 01:07:53.460
It is working.

01:07:53.710 --> 01:07:54.460
It has already clicked.

01:07:54.710 --> 01:07:55.250
It has happened.

01:08:02.590 --> 01:08:06.880
Now you have to enlighten many lights.

01:08:15.130 --> 01:08:17.880
We call it "Deepawali".

01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:22.210
Diwali is Deepawali, means "the rows of lights".

01:08:33.250 --> 01:08:38.040
And by celebrating this Diwali with so many of you,

01:08:38.090 --> 01:08:43.960
I'm sure we'll have such a torch of light

01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:47.670
which will go round the whole world.

01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:08.750
Just remember you are not a small drop, now you

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.960
have become the ocean and you have to spread.

01:09:27.340 --> 01:09:29.920
Now you are sitting on your thrones,

01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:34.590
and assume your powers.

01:09:44.210 --> 01:09:46.420
You have all the powers within you,

01:09:46.710 --> 01:09:48.210
you have to just manifest it.

01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:04.090
You have to just feel yourself, understand yourself,

01:10:04.340 --> 01:10:06.420
what is your responsibility.

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:20.000
You've been asking for light, now you've got the light.

01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:23.000
You have become the light, now give light to others.

01:10:36.090 --> 01:10:41.750
So achieve a state where your light is on your head,

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.500
on your Sahasrara,

01:10:57.630 --> 01:10:59.800
and that it is in your heart.

01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:08.300
You are not ordinary people.

01:11:13.420 --> 01:11:15.250
Never think that way.

01:11:20.090 --> 01:11:22.210
Actually in Sahaja Yoga

01:11:22.460 --> 01:11:25.590
only so-called "ordinary" people will come.

01:11:39.340 --> 01:11:43.090
Christ has said, "Meek in heart will inherit the earth."

01:12:06.750 --> 01:12:09.710
So you are meek in heart and you always think you are

01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:12.090
ordinary because you are humble.

01:12:25.670 --> 01:12:29.880
But the extraordinary now is manifesting, so accept it,

01:12:39.090 --> 01:12:43.340
and the extraordinary is that you have all the powers and

01:12:43.420 --> 01:12:46.000
you are absolutely humble people.

01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:09.000
Now the celebration of Diwali should be that we carry

01:13:09.090 --> 01:13:14.090
the light all over the world and enlighten people,

01:13:14.340 --> 01:13:16.040
as many as we can.

01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:27.420
None of our private things,

01:13:27.710 --> 01:13:31.000
none of our own problems are important.

01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:54.920
So that is what it is, that we have to realize that we have

01:13:55.130 --> 01:14:00.050
got a certain position which no one has in this world.

01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:21.880
So once you understand, your own esteem goes up and

01:14:22.090 --> 01:14:24.340
you see for yourself what you have to do.

01:14:39.170 --> 01:14:42.500
So then, everybody should today

01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:46.210
decide and take a oath, that we'll do

01:14:46.460 --> 01:14:50.250
everything to spread Sahaja Yoga with humility.

01:15:10.460 --> 01:15:13.710
So now we'll have the puja,

01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:17.170
and in this puja you all should promise to yourself

01:15:17.460 --> 01:15:25.210
that you will create a Deepawali in every household,

01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:29.500
in every country, in the whole world.

01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:54.210
May God bless you all.
