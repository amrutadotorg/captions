1
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:12,708
This chakra is placed at the back of the sternum bone as I told you.

2
00:00:12,788 --> 00:00:23,955
In childhood, the antibodies are formed in the sternum bone.

3
00:00:26,441 --> 00:00:33,739
They are the warriors or the [SOUNDS LIKE Sainikas] of the Devi.

4
00:00:33,819 --> 00:00:41,084
Until the age of 12 years they grow and multiply,

5
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:49,173
and ultimately they all get distributed all over the body,

6
00:00:52,919 --> 00:01:02,095
and a human being is made able to face any outside invasion on him.

7
00:01:09,307 --> 00:01:16,869
These antibodies know how to fight.

8
00:01:18,268 --> 00:01:26,923
They are extremely confident and they know who are their enemies.

9
00:01:29,336 --> 00:01:33,417
They've all these messages built in themselves.

10
00:01:34,937 --> 00:01:43,486
So when the anti-God element enters
into the being through any process,

11
00:01:43,566 --> 00:01:56,597
say, through food, through words, through
action, through devilish people, or black magic,

12
00:01:58,094 --> 00:02:10,508
these antibodies combine together, collectively fight the invaders.

13
00:02:15,007 --> 00:02:23,637
Those who do not have their Central Heart properly developed

14
00:02:23,717 --> 00:02:27,240
suffer from tremendous insecurity all their lives.

15
00:02:31,473 --> 00:02:42,580
When they are children, you try to control them by frightening.

16
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:50,036
These children later on become extremely insecure.

17
00:02:50,116 --> 00:02:55,533
They are afraid of darkness, they are afraid of night.

18
00:02:55,613 --> 00:02:59,892
Some of them are afraid of everything.

19
00:02:59,978 --> 00:03:10,169
Because the antibodies that are built
in the body are not sufficient in number

20
00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:21,471
and being this center so weak, the person feels extremely insecure.

21
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:37,714
Later on in life when the child goes to the school
or he tries to work out something for the future,

22
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:49,465
then also his confidence can be shaken
by parents, teachers, and outside people.

23
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:56,962
So it is very important to understand children who are growing.

24
00:03:57,936 --> 00:04:06,796
In the West they analyze everything and
try to put human beings into compartments.

25
00:04:07,962 --> 00:04:19,581
First the child, is a child according to them,
child has no innocence, and he's extremely selfish.

26
00:04:20,638 --> 00:04:33,443
Second part is adolescence, which
they think is a very arbitrary, moody stuff.

27
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:41,208
In India, we do not know that there is something like adolescence.

28
00:04:41,288 --> 00:04:52,300
Now these adolescent people form a group, and
they start criticizing or making fun of all the elders.

29
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:55,360
At a very young age it starts.

30
00:04:58,326 --> 00:05:07,221
First they make fun of the teachers, then of the
parents, then of all the people who are senior to them.

31
00:05:09,911 --> 00:05:17,376
They start becoming extremely active in their brains
because they see too many televisions and things like that,

32
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:30,362
and then they start behaving at a very young
age in such violent ways that one cannot imagine.

33
00:05:30,443 --> 00:05:34,686
I used to live about 25 miles away from London.

34
00:05:34,766 --> 00:05:43,133
And every time I would go to London, I would find
some children doing some sort of a mischief, somewhere.

35
00:05:43,232 --> 00:05:47,878
One day some of them entered into my compartment,

36
00:05:49,191 --> 00:05:54,897
and they started pulling out all the covers,

37
00:05:54,977 --> 00:06:06,665
thrusting their knives into the seats, opening out all the upholstery.

38
00:06:06,745 --> 00:06:15,135
I was just sitting and watching. So I said, "Now
are you tired? Please sit down. What's the problem?"

39
00:06:15,215 --> 00:06:21,028
They said, "We are all very angry." I
said, "For what? Why are you angry?"

40
00:06:21,108 --> 00:06:27,219
Said, "We are just angry." I said, "But
you have to be angry for something."

41
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:36,793
They were children going to good
schools definitely, wearing very good clothes.

42
00:06:36,892 --> 00:06:42,212
And then I had to, - when the train
stopped - I called the ticket collector

43
00:06:42,292 --> 00:06:52,010
and told him that these boys have been doing all this
hooliganic, hooliganism in the compartment and you better look at it.

44
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:59,539
And he came in and he said, "this is a common
thing" and then somehow or other he took them out.

45
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:06,620
But the only thing I felt about them is, that
all of them had their Center Heart catching.

46
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:14,616
On the Kundalini, they were catching their Center Heart.

47
00:07:14,696 --> 00:07:21,133
But when they saw Me, they sat down.
They were quiet, they listened to Me.

48
00:07:21,213 --> 00:07:24,640
I settled their Center Heart.

49
00:07:28,729 --> 00:07:33,862
And most of them said, "We are angry with our mother." "Why?"

50
00:07:33,942 --> 00:07:38,727
"Because our brothers are angry." "But why your brothers are angry?"

51
00:07:38,807 --> 00:07:44,850
Then I discovered that Freud has given
these funny ideas against the mother.

52
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:51,404
Mother itself, can you imagine! What a anti-God activity it is.

53
00:07:51,597 --> 00:08:00,513
To an Indian, Mother is the primal thing - any Indian.

54
00:08:00,593 --> 00:08:06,131
Because his sense of security lies in the mother.

55
00:08:06,211 --> 00:08:16,287
Even if the father is hot-tempered, is
angry, still they depend on the mother.

56
00:08:17,444 --> 00:08:24,444
Because mother knows when to get angry and
when not to get angry. She has the discrimination.

57
00:08:25,075 --> 00:08:28,603
And she is the one who protects them.

58
00:08:29,096 --> 00:08:33,304
I've told you the first reason, the family insecurities.

59
00:08:33,384 --> 00:08:41,463
The child does not know when he comes back from school,
whether his mother would be there or she would be gone.

60
00:08:43,635 --> 00:08:50,353
They don't have mothers who can bear a lot from the husbands and smile

61
00:08:50,433 --> 00:08:54,916
and show no signs of their agony to their children.

62
00:08:54,996 --> 00:08:59,943
But the mothers in that country, I've
seen, always try to use their children

63
00:09:00,023 --> 00:09:05,384
from all kinds of emotional blackmail, you can call it.

64
00:09:05,464 --> 00:09:10,625
They try to torture the child by telling all
the things the husband is doing to them

65
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:14,923
and whatever is the problem they are facing with the husbands.

66
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:25,155
So the child is not secured by the mother, but, on
the contrary, child starts giving security to mother there.

67
00:09:25,241 --> 00:09:31,058
At a very young age it starts, and the child
becomes extremely negative and left-sided.

68
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:38,119
He feels that he's born in a place
full of hatred, insecurity, and fear.

69
00:09:38,319 --> 00:09:53,908
When a person is frightened, this center start breathing
fast, giving rhythmic instructions to all the antibodies.

70
00:09:53,989 --> 00:10:01,405
With that you feel you are getting a palpitation in the heart.

71
00:10:03,298 --> 00:10:15,723
This palpitation is nothing but a signal to all
the antibodies to fight the emergency of an attack.

72
00:10:20,761 --> 00:10:30,812
But when somebody builds up insecurity
later on in life, it becomes a physical problem.

73
00:10:31,316 --> 00:10:37,496
If they have insecurities earlier, it is an emotional problem.

74
00:10:37,883 --> 00:10:48,871
But later on in life, when one develops a insecurity
- any kind, like a wife is insecure about her husband;

75
00:10:50,302 --> 00:11:03,159
husband is a loafer or a bad man, and carrying on with
other women, so the motherhood of the wife is challenged.

76
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:10,319
And when her motherhood is challenged,
she may get the weakening of this center,

77
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:16,067
by which she may suffer quite a lot and may have even breast cancer.

78
00:11:16,148 --> 00:11:21,496
These insecurities can be also self-made, imaginary.

79
00:11:21,576 --> 00:11:32,759
People can just think about it and build up some
sort of insecurities, which are of no actual existence.

80
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:40,450
This Chakra is ruined in women when they lose their only child;

81
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:46,164
because their motherhood is finished, they feel.

82
00:11:46,244 --> 00:11:50,885
And that is the worst thing that can
happen to a woman, if she's a woman.

83
00:11:50,965 --> 00:12:00,494
But if she's not a woman, she doesn't feel
much, and she just behaves in a very manly way.

84
00:12:00,574 --> 00:12:08,662
And that's what I've seen in the West, that
women really don't much care when their children die.

85
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:12,040
But it is because they are not women.

86
00:12:12,121 --> 00:12:20,320
If you are a woman you definitely
feel for your children and their death.

87
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:26,046
But after some time, such a woman comes back again

88
00:12:26,126 --> 00:12:33,933
and she accepts the life as it is, for the sake of her
husband, or may be if she has more relations or other children.

89
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:43,139
She becomes extremely powerful as
a reaction to what has happened to her.

90
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:50,515
That's only possible if your center of Heart is all right.

91
00:12:50,595 --> 00:12:59,367
Such women do not grudge, do not complain,
are extremely serene, and can bear up lots of things.

92
00:12:59,447 --> 00:13:08,431
They are extremely tolerant and can
go to any extent to help their children,

93
00:13:08,511 --> 00:13:11,672
but they are never spoiling their children.

94
00:13:11,752 --> 00:13:19,541
They never spoil their children, because they
understand spoiling is much worse than beating the child.

95
00:13:19,621 --> 00:13:27,184
They never spoil the children, nor ever pamper
them, and never get dominated by their children.

96
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:31,757
They know, "I have to guide the
child and have to look after the child."

97
00:13:31,837 --> 00:13:39,439
So they look after all the ideals and
righteousness and the virtues of the child.

98
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:49,004
And if he tries to get out of it, they go all out
to win him over back to virtue and to better life.

99
00:13:49,084 --> 00:13:58,361
But those people, those women, who
do not care for actual growth of the child,

100
00:13:58,447 --> 00:14:01,753
may just avoid it and escape it.

101
00:14:01,834 --> 00:14:09,883
In the men, this chakra is caught up if
they have lost their mother very early,

102
00:14:09,963 --> 00:14:15,376
or if their mother by chance is a very cruel woman.

103
00:14:15,468 --> 00:14:22,317
Also this chakra can be caught up by men, if they have been to wars,

104
00:14:22,397 --> 00:14:27,743
and if they have seen frightful things in the war.

105
00:14:27,823 --> 00:14:32,236
Such people could be extremely emotional

106
00:14:32,317 --> 00:14:39,998
and could be easily befooled by
people who try to win over their emotions.
