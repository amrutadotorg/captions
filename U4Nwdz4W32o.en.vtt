MUSIC AND SAHAJA YOGA - PART ONE

00:18.243 --> 00:26.579
INDIAN CLASSICAL MUSIC: MUSIC OF THE SPIRIT

00:34.867 --> 00:41.814
Now in India, since ages - it’s
a traditional country - since ages,

00:42.015 --> 00:48.569
we have been living a different life, when
ancient times.

00:48.770 --> 00:54.960
You see, now even the climate is so good,
that you can stay outside in a forest.

00:55.161 --> 00:58.202
You don’t need so many things in this
country.

00:58.403 --> 01:06.444
So, in the ancient times, so many people
whom we can call as seers and sages

01:06.645 --> 01:13.198
went into the forest to find out what is
the basis of human beings,

01:13.399 --> 01:20.275
what is the meaning of human life, what is
the ultimate goal of human beings.

01:20.476 --> 01:24.825
And they found out that it is the Spirit.

01:25.026 --> 01:30.253
And they based all the Indian laws and
Indian philosophies,

01:30.454 --> 01:36.479
music, art, dance, drama, every aspect
of life,

01:36.680 --> 01:42.190
on the basis that we have to become
the Spirit.

01:44.891 --> 01:53.006
And the principle of music is that it
should entertain the Spirit.

01:55.406 --> 02:01.019
You, being Sahaja Yogis, and most of you

02:01.220 --> 02:07.790
have never learned any Indian music
as such, like Me.

02:08.235 --> 02:19.359
But it’s a fact that Indian music comes
from Omkar,

02:19.953 --> 02:25.284
from the Divine source of sound.

02:25.485 --> 02:36.605
And that’s why that comforts, entertains,
amuses the Spirit.

02:38.867 --> 02:47.230
Otherwise, the Spirit is so self-satisfied
by itself, it enjoys itself.

02:48.281 --> 02:57.132
But with music and art, I feel it gets
its reflection, you see,

02:57.362 --> 03:05.418
reflects its own beautiful existence

03:05.643 --> 03:10.869
which is permeating into every

03:11.857 --> 03:15.968
little particle, into every molecule, into
every atom.

03:16.169 --> 03:20.793
And that reflection when the Spirit sees,

03:20.994 --> 03:29.586
it has that new dimension of a beautiful
expansion of its personality,

03:29.787 --> 03:35.305
and as if you feel you are resounding
in the whole universe.

03:36.429 --> 03:38.916
We had no Namaz system of different times,

03:39.117 --> 03:42.408
but we have a system of music in different
times.

03:42.609 --> 03:47.065
At different time, a certain music should
be played where you describe a mood.

03:47.266 --> 03:53.119
And all the moods that are described have
to relate themselves to God.

03:54.129 --> 04:03.249
There is no other mood that is enjoyable
to the Spirit that does not relate to God.

04:03.450 --> 04:08.231
There’s no mood which one can enjoy.

04:09.141 --> 04:12.824
It's so scientific. Our music system is
extremely scientific,

04:13.025 --> 04:19.752
because it was taken in the form of this
music

04:19.968 --> 04:23.838
when actually the Kundalini moving into
different these Sapta Swaras.

04:24.039 --> 04:30.459
These seven Swaras are built in our seven
chakras:

04:31.300 --> 04:39.427
These start with Sa, then Re, Ga, Ma –
Mother,

04:39.628 --> 04:46.388
Pa, Dha, Ni. My name also starts with Ni.

04:48.018 --> 04:53.635
These seven Swaras are built-in with seven
notes

04:53.836 --> 05:01.344
and there are Vikrutis, Vikrut swaras,
which are the side - other,

05:01.545 --> 05:08.999
what you call, chakras that we have to make
about twelve Swaras.

05:09.200 --> 05:14.472
But nobody understood the real meaning
of music.

05:15.135 --> 05:21.270
Ragas were made also, just think
of it. Because first they chose the notes,

05:21.471 --> 05:27.346
the aroha, avarohas, the going up and down,
which was appealing to God.

05:27.547 --> 05:30.912
So the melodies were created. Melodies are
fixed.

05:31.113 --> 05:35.276
You cannot change the melodies, the notes,
because they found out

05:35.477 --> 05:41.274
that at this point the Spirit awakened.
On the vibrations they found out.

05:41.474 --> 05:46.852
They found out that when they sang this way
it did - worked out.

05:47.053 --> 05:52.459
The Veena they played and they found out
the exact Swaras.

05:53.309 --> 05:59.011
Exact Swaras, which would really make you
feel nice.

05:59.687 --> 06:04.986
So yesterday, as I told you, that I’ll tell
you about the ragas we have.

06:05.187 --> 06:10.205
Ra is energy. Ga is in Sanskrit language
‘Ga, Gayathi’,

06:10.406 --> 06:14.073
means ‘which penetrates’, ‘which moves
into everything’,

06:14.274 --> 06:20.152
it’s the ethereal, etheric qualities.
Etheric, into which, you see,

06:20.353 --> 06:23.846
you put anything into ether, you can
receive it anywhere.

06:24.047 --> 06:33.065
So the raga is the energy which goes
into the ether and touches your Spirit.

06:34.365 --> 06:36.010
That is the raga.

06:37.867 --> 06:46.703
And this is what is a raga is: it caters
to all your angularities.

06:46.904 --> 06:51.078
Supposing a person is very upset and
worried, he comes from office,

06:51.279 --> 06:55.820
sits down, puts on a raga - soothes you
down.

06:57.227 --> 06:59.492
It makes you settle down.

07:01.406 --> 07:04.833
But raga needs better is sitting down,
the settling down.

07:05.034 --> 07:08.102
Unless and until you settle down, you
cannot enjoy raga.

07:08.303 --> 07:13.589
Imagine, somebody listening to a raga when
he is jumpy.

07:14.307 --> 07:16.690
So, one has to settle down.

07:18.201 --> 07:27.176
Now, you see, one has to know that Indian
music is a very deep subject,

07:27.377 --> 07:33.534
it’s - only can be understood by people who
have depth in them.

07:33.735 --> 07:38.674
And I was surprised that the people who
went to Babamama’s Academy,

07:38.875 --> 07:43.112
in three months they started singing ragas
like Malkauns.

07:43.313 --> 07:48.807
So I think, Sahaja Yogis have a special
aptitude to pick up Indian music.

07:49.008 --> 07:52.370
And the way they learnt it, when people
spend years together.

07:52.571 --> 07:59.231
And I was very much surprised how it worked
that way, and the way you all are enjoying

07:59.432 --> 08:06.692
shows that it is the music of the heart,
music of the Spirit. And that’s why,

08:06.893 --> 08:12.338
even if you do not have education in that,
still you were all enjoying it very much.

08:12.852 --> 08:17.838
And that everybody - so many of you are
here - have enjoyed it thoroughly,

08:18.039 --> 08:24.179
is something shows the oneness,
the collectivity of enjoying music.

08:24.380 --> 08:28.218
Is that’s a sign of real ascent, and a real,

08:28.419 --> 08:35.708
I would say, advanced state of Self-
realization, that you all could,

08:35.927 --> 08:41.170
from very different, different countries,
different languages, different styles

08:41.371 --> 08:49.418
of music, all of you have enjoyed
the music, that was really universal.

08:50.340 --> 08:56.856
Question: Do You think that the music is
important in making the Kundalini rise

08:57.057 --> 09:02.652
in meditation or in Sahaja Yoga?
Shri Mataji: Yes, it’s a devotional music

09:02.853 --> 09:08.528
and a musical, devotional music if is sung
by people who are realized souls,

09:08.729 --> 09:14.612
reaches your heart, reaches your Kundalini
also

09:14.813 --> 09:19.050
and helps a lot to awaken them. So if
there are,

09:19.251 --> 09:23.457
these are all realized souls who were
there, the dancer, everybody.

09:23.636 --> 09:29.889
The dancer was playing the rhythm and
the rhythm is, is a Divine rhythm because

09:30.090 --> 09:33.527
she’s now become a realized soul – she’s
connected with the Divine.

09:33.728 --> 09:37.731
So when she dances, she creates a Divine
rhythm

09:37.932 --> 09:41.886
and when these people sing, they also sing
a Divine devotion.

09:42.087 --> 09:47.198
Otherwise, without connection if you sing
the praise of God, it doesn’t reach God

09:47.399 --> 09:51.401
because you are not connected. Like
a telephone which is not connected,

09:51.602 --> 09:54.556
if you start telephoning, your telephone
gets spoiled.

09:54.757 --> 09:57.775
So, for Devotion also you should be
connected with God.

09:57.976 --> 10:02.771
So, as they are connected with the Divine,
the music

10:03.780 --> 10:09.587
emits vibrations, what you call the Divine
vibration.

10:09.788 --> 10:14.655
As a result, it creates an atmosphere for
people to receive their realization.

10:14.856 --> 10:17.811
It become much easier for Me to give
realization

10:18.012 --> 10:24.608
because the atmosphere cleanses out and
people also get ready for realization.

10:25.587 --> 10:31.243
That's why I like music: because through
music you can spread vibrations.

10:31.444 --> 10:37.077
Very good media of spreading vibrations,
of loving vibrations.

10:37.278 --> 10:42.755
But those who are musicians have to be
loving people.

10:43.362 --> 10:52.563
Not hot-tempered, not showing off, not
thinking too much of themselves.

10:53.675 --> 10:57.910
All this will work very well if we
understand

10:58.111 --> 11:03.603
that this Divine Power is so powerful.

11:04.420 --> 11:09.365
So, it’s all coming up now. Now, we have
to just understand

11:09.566 --> 11:15.170
that we have to pay attention to ourselves
and meditate,

11:15.371 --> 11:19.639
and I’m sure, all the creativity will
definitely manifest,

11:19.840 --> 11:26.295
and will go on showing better and better
results.

11:26.589 --> 11:29.420
It is absolutely evident now.

11:29.621 --> 11:33.248
But it's for Sahaja Yogis now to take it
up, in a serious way.

11:33.449 --> 11:37.820
Whatever is your talent, may be music,
may be art,

11:38.021 --> 11:43.695
may be film making, or may be writing also.
Whatever comes up, you should really

11:43.896 --> 11:47.677
now devote some time to that talent that
you have.

11:47.878 --> 11:52.835
And it is going to work out, I’m sure, very
well. So now, you see, with this music,

11:53.036 --> 11:58.553
I have to say that the music within also
is very great.

11:58.754 --> 12:04.907
If you enjoy this music, then you know that
you enjoy also the music of your Spirit.

12:05.108 --> 12:08.669
May God bless you all. Sorry for today’s
delay, of course,

12:08.893 --> 12:12.220
but I bless you all from My heart.

12:12.421 --> 12:15.834
And may God give you greater and greater
creativity

12:16.035 --> 12:21.658
so that you express and manifest, through
your life, Sahaj.

12:21.859 --> 12:23.907
May God bless you.
