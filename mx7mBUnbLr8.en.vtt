00:03:42.303 --> 00:03:48.837
Today we are going to worship the Adi Shakti

00:03:49.037 --> 00:03:56.177
and the reflection of the Adi Shakti within you is the Kundalini.

00:03:58.267 --> 00:04:00.557
We can say this is the worship

00:04:00.757 --> 00:04:04.647
of the Adi Shakti and Adi Kundalini.

00:04:04.847 --> 00:04:14.577
If you understand that all this,

00:04:14.777 --> 00:04:21.607
whatever is created on this universe,

00:04:21.817 --> 00:04:29.057
and in many universes, is the work of the Adi Shakti.

00:04:29.497 --> 00:04:33.187
Now many people believe that there is one God.

00:04:33.387 --> 00:04:38.397
It’s true, there’s one God, God Almighty,

00:04:38.597 --> 00:04:46.947
but He has His own powers which He can embody into someone

00:04:47.147 --> 00:04:54.257
and can get His own manifestation expressed.

00:04:54.617 --> 00:05:02.447
So, first of all, He did was to create

00:05:02.647 --> 00:05:06.217
the power of Adi Shakti.

00:05:06.427 --> 00:05:12.757
When It was created then there was a sound,

00:05:12.957 --> 00:05:16.817
the sound that we call as Aum, logos or anything you call it,

00:05:17.017 --> 00:05:19.237
by the primordial sound,

00:05:19.437 --> 00:05:23.497
and these three powers came out of that sound -

00:05:23.697 --> 00:05:29.217
is A, U and M -Aum.

00:05:29.607 --> 00:05:34.037
The Adi Shakti is the One

00:05:34.237 --> 00:05:41.517
Who embodies the desire of God Almighty.

00:05:42.367 --> 00:05:49.217
The desire of God Almighty comes out of His compassion

00:05:49.417 --> 00:05:55.977
and for His own expression,

00:05:56.177 --> 00:05:59.497
for His own manifestation,

00:05:59.697 --> 00:06:03.817
for His own reflection.

00:06:04.937 --> 00:06:09.717
I would say that He must be tired of loneliness

00:06:09.917 --> 00:06:14.817
so He must have thought of creating a partner

00:06:15.017 --> 00:06:20.487
who will manifest His desires.

00:06:20.997 --> 00:06:30.497
Thus, the power of God Almighty separated from Him

00:06:30.697 --> 00:06:37.007
and formed an embodiment of His compassion,

00:06:37.207 --> 00:06:42.487
His desire to create.

00:06:43.167 --> 00:06:47.227
They say in Sanskrit, they use a word 'chitvilas',

00:06:47.427 --> 00:06:51.867
is the enjoyment of the Adi Shakti.

00:06:52.067 --> 00:06:55.897
'Chit' is, as you know is 'chitta', is attention.

00:06:56.097 --> 00:07:02.087
The attention has its own joy

00:07:02.287 --> 00:07:06.897
and to manifest that joy of Her attention,

00:07:07.097 --> 00:07:10.257
She created all the universes,

00:07:10.457 --> 00:07:15.167
She created this Mother Earth, She created all this nature;

00:07:15.367 --> 00:07:20.857
She created all the animals; She created all the human beings

00:07:21.067 --> 00:07:24.617
and She created all the Sahaja Yogis.

00:07:24.817 --> 00:07:31.207
This is how the whole creation has worked out.

00:07:32.617 --> 00:07:35.337
At this juncture one may ask that,

00:07:35.547 --> 00:07:40.707
"Why did She not straight forward create human beings?"

00:07:41.257 --> 00:07:44.117
That was the idea of God Almighty,

00:07:44.317 --> 00:07:51.027
just to create human beings without telling them anything,

00:07:51.227 --> 00:07:57.507
something, better animals than the rest of the animals.

00:07:57.777 --> 00:08:00.517
But Adi Shakti being the Mother,

00:08:00.717 --> 00:08:04.677
She had Her own way of expression,

00:08:04.877 --> 00:08:08.607
that She thought She must create the mirrors

00:08:08.807 --> 00:08:14.247
for God Almighty to see His face, to see His image,

00:08:14.447 --> 00:08:16.097
to see His character

00:08:16.307 --> 00:08:22.067
and that's how this long range of evolution took place.

00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:28.667
This evolution had to work out this way

00:08:28.867 --> 00:08:34.497
because they had to know from where they come.

00:08:34.737 --> 00:08:40.927
We must know that we come from nature.

00:08:41.127 --> 00:08:46.827
Even nature should know it comes from the Mother Earth,

00:08:47.037 --> 00:08:51.887
and Mother Earth Herself has Her own Kundalini.

00:08:52.087 --> 00:08:57.947
And She too is not just a dead earth,

00:08:58.147 --> 00:09:02.687
but She knows, She thinks, She understands and She regulates.

00:09:02.897 --> 00:09:08.507
You can see in the nature how every tree has got its own limitations,

00:09:08.707 --> 00:09:15.697
how every fruit is produced in a particular tree,

00:09:15.897 --> 00:09:21.637
how it happens? What works out, this kind of regulation?

00:09:21.837 --> 00:09:26.477
If this Mother Earth was moving with a higher speed than

00:09:26.677 --> 00:09:30.877
what it is today, we would not have been born even.

00:09:31.077 --> 00:09:35.017
Would have been less speed, it would not have worked out.

00:09:35.217 --> 00:09:37.597
See the whole plan that was made.

00:09:37.797 --> 00:09:43.227
It's a beautiful plan that the Mother Earth has to move around the sun

00:09:43.437 --> 00:09:48.187
in such a manner that different seasons are created.

00:09:48.387 --> 00:09:51.377
That's why the power, the Paramchaitanya,

00:09:51.577 --> 00:09:53.897
which is the power of the Adi Shakti,

00:09:54.097 --> 00:09:57.617
is also called as Ritambara Pragya.

00:09:57.817 --> 00:10:03.707
This is the power that does all the living work,

00:10:03.907 --> 00:10:09.927
all the organization, all the creation.

00:10:14.487 --> 00:10:19.757
In our human ego we start thinking that

00:10:19.957 --> 00:10:23.807
we do something, we can create.

00:10:24.007 --> 00:10:30.307
We cannot. We cannot even create a dust of particle,

00:10:30.507 --> 00:10:32.887
leave alone anything else.

00:10:33.087 --> 00:10:38.157
Whatever is created, out of that we may combine,

00:10:38.357 --> 00:10:43.857
we can put together and create something,

00:10:44.057 --> 00:10:53.437
but if you see that this whole thing is nothing but beyond our -

00:10:53.637 --> 00:10:58.517
any power.

00:10:58.717 --> 00:11:01.757
We cannot create anything.

00:11:01.957 --> 00:11:09.727
But what do we create is our myths, I should say.

00:11:09.927 --> 00:11:15.337
For example, something is made of gold.

00:11:15.537 --> 00:11:18.667
Still it is gold.

00:11:18.867 --> 00:11:22.007
Now something is made of wood,

00:11:22.207 --> 00:11:26.607
whatever it is made, is wood.

00:11:26.807 --> 00:11:30.377
The principle is the same into everything.

00:11:30.577 --> 00:11:35.297
So whatever may be your birth,

00:11:35.497 --> 00:11:38.377
whatever may be the country you are born,

00:11:38.577 --> 00:11:45.117
whatever may be your culture, you are human beings,

00:11:45.317 --> 00:11:48.937
basically you all are the same.

00:11:49.137 --> 00:11:54.577
You laugh the same, you smile the same,

00:11:54.777 --> 00:11:58.987
also, you cry the same way.

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:02.857
I haven't seen anybody crying with his hands,

00:12:03.057 --> 00:12:07.717
tears falling out of his fingers, do they?

00:12:08.801 --> 00:12:13.847
And that is how one has to realize that we are all bound

00:12:14.047 --> 00:12:18.707
by some common principle of life.

00:12:18.907 --> 00:12:24.317
And the common principle of life that has bound us

00:12:24.527 --> 00:12:31.367
by the Adi Shakti is that we all have Kundalini within us.

00:12:31.567 --> 00:12:34.277
All the human beings have Kundalini within us.

00:12:34.477 --> 00:12:36.727
It is not, it is not in the animals also,

00:12:36.927 --> 00:12:41.067
but it's not so developed; it's not yet, what you call,

00:12:41.267 --> 00:12:50.347
is full form of Kundalini that can be awakened.

00:12:50.547 --> 00:12:53.827
But in the human form only

00:12:54.027 --> 00:13:00.967
it has evolved as a connection,

00:13:01.167 --> 00:13:06.557
as one that is the divine force within us,

00:13:06.757 --> 00:13:12.057
which is the reflection of the Adi Kundalini,

00:13:12.257 --> 00:13:18.207
which is so easily awakened in this kali yuga.

00:13:18.407 --> 00:13:21.767
This is the common principle we all have.

00:13:21.967 --> 00:13:29.267
So we have to respect all the people, all the human beings,

00:13:29.467 --> 00:13:34.447
whatever nation they come from, whatever country they belong,

00:13:34.657 --> 00:13:41.577
whatever color they have, because they all have their Kundalini.

00:13:42.157 --> 00:13:44.727
Then there are people, as you people are,

00:13:44.927 --> 00:13:49.737
who are awakened people, who are enlightened people,

00:13:49.947 --> 00:13:52.907
who have got your realization.

00:13:53.107 --> 00:13:57.327
So when you understand that this is the

00:13:57.527 --> 00:14:04.467
enjoyment of the attention of the Adi Ma,

00:14:04.667 --> 00:14:08.247
of the Primordial Mother, it's just the play

00:14:08.447 --> 00:14:10.137
and the enjoyment.

00:14:10.337 --> 00:14:20.077
Then when you have achieved your full growth in spirituality

00:14:20.287 --> 00:14:23.837
what should happen to you?

00:14:24.037 --> 00:14:28.487
What should we feel?

00:14:28.687 --> 00:14:34.777
How do we then exist?

00:14:35.497 --> 00:14:40.787
This is the question many a times you have asked.

00:14:41.147 --> 00:14:44.647
Now when you ask questions itself it shows

00:14:44.847 --> 00:14:46.277
that you are not there,

00:14:46.477 --> 00:14:50.407
because once you are there you don't ask questions.

00:14:50.607 --> 00:14:52.577
Secondly, what happens to you

00:14:52.777 --> 00:14:57.497
is that you become just the existence.

00:14:57.697 --> 00:15:00.457
Just the existence.

00:15:00.657 --> 00:15:03.207
And that existence that you become,

00:15:03.407 --> 00:15:08.767
then you start reflecting the character of Divinity.

00:15:09.287 --> 00:15:14.387
This divine character is expressed not only nowadays,

00:15:14.587 --> 00:15:16.427
also much before.

00:15:16.627 --> 00:15:19.137
In every religion we have had people

00:15:19.337 --> 00:15:23.807
who had this divine character very well developed.

00:15:24.007 --> 00:15:29.157
For example, even you can say,

00:15:29.357 --> 00:15:36.327
the people who lived three thousand, four thousand year back in Colombia,

00:15:36.527 --> 00:15:43.397
I found that in their statues they had Kundalini

00:15:43.597 --> 00:15:46.067
and a khumba also,

00:15:46.267 --> 00:15:49.147
commonly, whatever we have found out they had

00:15:49.347 --> 00:15:55.947
a Kundalini being expressed three and a half coils.

00:15:56.147 --> 00:16:00.757
This Kundalini we have within ourselves is now proved to you.

00:16:00.957 --> 00:16:05.897
You know that there is this power within us.

00:16:06.107 --> 00:16:11.467
Also, you've come to know what happens when we deviate

00:16:11.677 --> 00:16:17.107
from the middle path of our ascent.

00:16:17.307 --> 00:16:19.937
Here also the same Kundalini,

00:16:20.137 --> 00:16:25.343
which is the expression of the Primordial Mother,

00:16:25.757 --> 00:16:32.217
tells on your finger tips what's going wrong with you,

00:16:32.417 --> 00:16:37.227
where are you lacking, what is your problem.

00:16:37.427 --> 00:16:41.717
So now when we are enlightened people,

00:16:41.927 --> 00:16:47.097
we have become saints and we are above all others,

00:16:47.297 --> 00:16:54.367
what should we do is to understand fully well -

00:16:54.567 --> 00:16:57.677
not only mentally, but from your heart -

00:16:57.877 --> 00:17:03.987
that now you have got these divine vibrations

00:17:04.187 --> 00:17:09.277
and these divine vibrations can tell you where are you,

00:17:09.477 --> 00:17:14.717
what are you, where is the problem.

00:17:14.917 --> 00:17:17.837
Also, it will tell you wherever you go, like that:

00:17:18.037 --> 00:17:22.567
I talked to some people who went to Jerusalem and they said,

00:17:22.767 --> 00:17:26.137
"Mother, the whole place was just vibrating

00:17:26.337 --> 00:17:29.717
with spiritual vibrations."

00:17:29.917 --> 00:17:32.327
They went to Chindwara, somebody, and he said,

00:17:32.527 --> 00:17:34.487
"I'll find out Mother's place, what is there,

00:17:34.687 --> 00:17:38.877
after all, it's not difficult. Through vibrations I'll find out."

00:17:39.077 --> 00:17:43.117
So he said, "As soon as I touched the platform I started jumping.

00:17:43.317 --> 00:17:45.227
I said, 'Now what to do, where to -

00:17:45.427 --> 00:17:47.317
from here only there are vibrations,

00:17:47.517 --> 00:17:49.887
how will I reach Mother's place?'"

00:17:50.087 --> 00:17:52.457
So then he sat down and started wondering,

00:17:52.657 --> 00:17:57.707
"Now, how will I find out where did Mother take Her birth?"

00:17:57.907 --> 00:18:03.617
He was sitting down and then he saw the star which is the Venus.

00:18:03.817 --> 00:18:07.647
He followed the Venus star and then he went and asked

00:18:07.857 --> 00:18:11.757
and that's how he found the place.

00:18:12.157 --> 00:18:14.427
So, the whole plan, the whole thing

00:18:14.627 --> 00:18:17.537
is not done haphazard, in any way.

00:18:17.737 --> 00:18:20.907
If you see a tree, every tree has leaves

00:18:21.107 --> 00:18:27.237
and every leaf is given chance to have the sun's rays.

00:18:27.817 --> 00:18:33.257
In the nature, if you see, it's so harmonious, so beautiful.

00:18:33.677 --> 00:18:36.007
We are the ones which spoil the nature

00:18:36.207 --> 00:18:40.507
because we don't understand that we have come from nature

00:18:40.707 --> 00:18:42.807
and we have to respect it.

00:18:43.007 --> 00:18:45.097
I've already told you many a times

00:18:45.297 --> 00:18:48.187
about how human beings were formed

00:18:48.387 --> 00:18:55.337
by different chemicals who came also,

00:18:55.537 --> 00:18:58.597
carbon came from the mother earth.

00:18:58.797 --> 00:19:02.037
All this leads us to understand

00:19:02.237 --> 00:19:06.887
that we have a very big responsibility.

00:19:07.447 --> 00:19:13.437
The whole work has taken thousands and thousands and thousands of years.

00:19:13.637 --> 00:19:16.347
And now you all have reached a state

00:19:16.547 --> 00:19:20.487
where you have become yourself.

00:19:20.687 --> 00:19:22.837
You know yourself.

00:19:23.037 --> 00:19:27.087
This is a very big, I think should say,

00:19:27.287 --> 00:19:34.597
a very big jump in the evolutionary process.

00:19:36.967 --> 00:19:43.717
The evolutionary process started long, long time back.

00:20:13.187 --> 00:20:18.597
So I think is very important for you to worship the Adi Shakti

00:20:18.797 --> 00:20:25.917
and the Adi Kundalini. Is absolutely without understanding,

00:20:26.117 --> 00:20:35.797
absolutely you cannot understand how you have become a saint.

00:20:37.237 --> 00:20:42.287
When you will know within yourself you have got all these centers,

00:20:42.487 --> 00:20:46.217
and these centers have to be awakened

00:20:46.417 --> 00:20:49.917
through the awakening of the Kundalini,

00:20:50.117 --> 00:20:57.897
and that the Kundalini expresses Herself through your fingertips.

00:20:58.757 --> 00:21:07.687
Unless and until you fully identify with this knowledge

00:21:07.887 --> 00:21:12.617
there's always a possibility that you will deviate

00:21:12.817 --> 00:21:18.747
from the path of your perfection.

00:21:19.847 --> 00:21:23.287
Many people who come to Sahaja Yoga, I have seen,

00:21:23.487 --> 00:21:27.997
they meet some Sahaja Yogis who are half way

00:21:28.207 --> 00:21:32.117
and because they are mental, they start arguing,

00:21:32.317 --> 00:21:36.937
"How is it this is this way, how is it, it is this way?

00:21:37.137 --> 00:21:41.897
How is it he's a Sahaja Yogi, he behaves like that?"

00:21:42.207 --> 00:21:45.987
There are so many ways of people relating

00:21:46.187 --> 00:21:49.847
to the power of the Divine.

00:21:50.057 --> 00:21:54.337
I have told you in the beginning that God felt lonely

00:21:54.537 --> 00:22:00.007
and that's why He created this Adi Shakti

00:22:00.207 --> 00:22:03.387
and through Her the whole universe was created.

00:22:03.587 --> 00:22:11.327
But also true that as you are seeking,

00:22:11.537 --> 00:22:14.777
also the Divine is seeking you.

00:22:14.977 --> 00:22:23.327
Also that your seeking is absolutely awarded

00:22:23.527 --> 00:22:31.087
if you understand the simple thing about Divine:

00:22:31.287 --> 00:22:37.047
that it is the One that has given you intelligence.

00:22:37.247 --> 00:22:41.217
It is the One that has given you wisdom.

00:22:41.417 --> 00:22:44.387
It is the One which has given you

00:22:44.587 --> 00:22:47.567
whatever you have- as you were singing that,

00:22:47.767 --> 00:22:52.117
"Whatever we have is given by You".

00:22:52.437 --> 00:22:56.827
If that is the case that all that you have

00:22:57.027 --> 00:23:01.477
is given by your Kundalini,

00:23:01.687 --> 00:23:05.377
by this mother power of your Kundalini,

00:23:05.577 --> 00:23:10.337
then is very important to understand what is the need

00:23:10.587 --> 00:23:18.207
of keeping Her happy and Her satisfaction.

00:23:19.657 --> 00:23:27.177
You must try to see what makes Her happy.

00:23:28.607 --> 00:23:31.787
As I said, there's a relationship

00:23:31.987 --> 00:23:38.517
between the realized souls and the Divine.

00:23:38.717 --> 00:23:42.577
The Divine is happy when you are happy.

00:23:42.787 --> 00:23:48.447
Or we can say, when the Divine makes you happy

00:23:48.647 --> 00:23:52.087
and you are happy, then the Divine is happy.

00:23:52.287 --> 00:23:55.137
It's such a relationship.

00:23:55.337 --> 00:23:58.467
And it's so close, it's so close,

00:23:58.667 --> 00:24:03.927
we can say as the sun has sun's rays,

00:24:04.127 --> 00:24:11.027
or the moon has its own moonlight.

00:24:11.227 --> 00:24:22.457
It is so close, it's so ingrained, so much built in

00:24:22.657 --> 00:24:27.877
and that should give you full control over yourself

00:24:28.077 --> 00:24:33.417
and over your development.

00:24:33.917 --> 00:24:41.467
They describe it in various ways that you must surrender.

00:24:42.327 --> 00:24:46.087
Now

00:24:51.682 --> 00:24:56.817
one surrenders, of course, with fear.

00:24:57.037 --> 00:24:59.747
If somebody comes with a sword and says, "All right, you surrender,"

00:24:59.947 --> 00:25:01.347
you may.

00:25:01.557 --> 00:25:03.487
But as soon as that person will disappear,

00:25:03.687 --> 00:25:06.787
you'll take out another sword and cut his throat.

00:25:06.987 --> 00:25:10.257
That surrender has no meaning.

00:25:10.457 --> 00:25:16.687
That surrender is a surrender which is just forced onto you.

00:25:16.887 --> 00:25:20.817
All such surrenders have been creating problems,

00:25:21.027 --> 00:25:24.607
because it has a reaction.

00:25:24.807 --> 00:25:32.827
But your surrender to Divine is extremely joy giving.

00:25:33.057 --> 00:25:48.927
Like a salt which dissolves into the sea automatically,

00:25:49.127 --> 00:25:54.827
into the water automatically,

00:25:55.027 --> 00:26:02.767
that soluble nature is really joy giving.

00:26:03.367 --> 00:26:07.807
If you can just feel that within yourself,

00:26:08.007 --> 00:26:11.197
that you are one with the Divine.

00:26:11.397 --> 00:26:16.487
You are dissolved in the ocean of the Divine.

00:26:16.987 --> 00:26:26.857
And then what takes your form is nothing but extreme love,

00:26:27.067 --> 00:26:33.457
compassion and, as a result, extreme joy.

00:26:33.657 --> 00:26:40.637
Many people tell Me that, "Mother, it's very difficult to forgive someone."

00:26:41.267 --> 00:26:46.617
But I think it's very horrible not to forgive someone.

00:26:46.817 --> 00:26:50.657
There's a great joy in forgiving,

00:26:50.857 --> 00:26:55.377
very great joy in forgiving. And as soon as you forgive,

00:26:55.577 --> 00:27:01.877
the Divine takes over and Divine will look after you.

00:27:02.447 --> 00:27:05.987
Nobody can disturb you.

00:27:06.187 --> 00:27:10.637
But first you must surrender to the Divine,

00:27:10.837 --> 00:27:13.077
that is what is forgiveness.

00:27:13.277 --> 00:27:17.797
Just don't bother yourself as to punish somebody

00:27:17.997 --> 00:27:20.737
or to do something against somebody.

00:27:20.937 --> 00:27:24.927
The Divine takes over from you

00:27:25.127 --> 00:27:28.027
and does whatever is needed,

00:27:28.227 --> 00:27:34.897
and in such a beautiful manner that it is worth seeing how it works.

00:27:35.297 --> 00:27:40.457
Adi Shakti's power, this Divine, is described in every religion.

00:27:40.657 --> 00:27:42.897
say in Islam called ruh;

00:27:43.097 --> 00:27:47.877
in the Bible is called as All Pervading Power;

00:27:48.077 --> 00:27:52.257
is called as allak - that which cannot be seen;

00:27:52.457 --> 00:27:58.217
Niranjana, the One which is beyond any attachment sort of thing.

00:27:58.417 --> 00:28:03.017
All these words are used for this Divine Power.

00:28:03.217 --> 00:28:06.777
People have heard about it, people have sung about it;

00:28:06.977 --> 00:28:12.537
but unfortunately very few people felt it,

00:28:12.737 --> 00:28:17.697
and when they felt it they didn't know how to give it to others,

00:28:17.907 --> 00:28:20.237
how to make others feel it.

00:28:20.437 --> 00:28:23.927
So whatever they talked became sort of a story

00:28:24.127 --> 00:28:26.177
or something nonsensical.

00:28:26.377 --> 00:28:30.157
Nobody could believe that they have felt anything like that

00:28:30.357 --> 00:28:36.277
or could imagine that there is such a Power really existing.

00:28:36.477 --> 00:28:42.317
Now, luckily, it has become quite a universal fact for all of you,

00:28:42.517 --> 00:28:46.597
that you know there is this Power.

00:28:46.797 --> 00:28:49.147
You're sure about this Power

00:28:49.347 --> 00:28:53.527
because you can feel it within yourself.

00:28:53.727 --> 00:28:56.667
And when you feel it, you feel very joyous.

00:28:56.877 --> 00:29:03.047
You can make out whether somebody is telling you the truth or not,

00:29:03.247 --> 00:29:08.857
because you can see on the vibrations on this,

00:29:09.057 --> 00:29:18.387
I should say, the Power of Adi Shakti.

00:29:18.597 --> 00:29:21.827
She tells you the truth.

00:29:23.877 --> 00:29:28.867
If somebody has done some harm to you, for example,

00:29:29.067 --> 00:29:33.707
now you may say that, "Mother, if you forgive that person

00:29:33.907 --> 00:29:37.667
then it's not the truth because he has definitely harmed,

00:29:37.877 --> 00:29:43.097
and if I forgive that means I accept that he has not harmed me."

00:29:43.297 --> 00:29:45.647
This kind of argument is possible.

00:29:45.847 --> 00:29:48.567
Now you will see, you'll be surprised

00:29:48.767 --> 00:29:51.437
that you forgive that person,

00:29:51.637 --> 00:29:56.227
because the truth is whether you forgive or you don't forgive,

00:29:56.427 --> 00:29:59.247
you don't do anything.

00:29:59.447 --> 00:30:00.927
That's the truth.

00:30:01.137 --> 00:30:05.677
So out of compassion if you forgive someone,

00:30:05.877 --> 00:30:09.337
compassion becomes the truth.

00:30:09.537 --> 00:30:13.217
Is the compassion that tells you the truth.

00:30:13.417 --> 00:30:16.557
So all the absolute truth that you know is

00:30:16.757 --> 00:30:21.397
through the compassion of the Divine Power.

00:30:21.597 --> 00:30:26.307
Maybe sometimes people say, "We saw the vibrations, Mother,

00:30:26.507 --> 00:30:29.677
and we felt this way and still it happened."

00:30:29.887 --> 00:30:32.817
It makes no difference.

00:30:33.017 --> 00:30:35.877
Whatever has happened has happened, doesn't matter.

00:30:36.077 --> 00:30:40.117
You have felt the vibrations, and you asked the vibrations

00:30:40.317 --> 00:30:44.547
and you acted upon the vibrations, that's all.

00:30:44.747 --> 00:30:49.367
Whether it turned out to be that way or not is different.

00:30:49.567 --> 00:30:52.967
Because it had to be the other way round.

00:30:53.167 --> 00:30:56.577
Some drama is going on. Is the chitvilas,

00:30:56.787 --> 00:31:01.607
is the enjoyment of the chitta of the Divine.

00:31:01.807 --> 00:31:04.507
So, it's a play going on.

00:31:04.707 --> 00:31:10.967
If you can see that play then you don't get disturbed - it's a play.

00:31:11.177 --> 00:31:19.917
How it works, how it is organized, is not your headache.

00:31:20.117 --> 00:31:25.427
You just have to see the play of the Divine, how it works out.

00:31:25.627 --> 00:31:30.097
We have seen now, all of you, which you call as miracles have happened.

00:31:30.297 --> 00:31:34.207
"Mother, this miracle has happened, that miracle has happened

00:31:34.407 --> 00:31:41.937
and I know is all the miracle of the Divine."

00:31:42.217 --> 00:31:50.777
Despite that, our faith in the Divine is not so much enlightened faith.

00:31:51.257 --> 00:31:53.907
When you have the enlightened faith,

00:31:54.107 --> 00:32:00.637
you don't worry about things which are very important in life.

00:32:00.837 --> 00:32:06.677
It works out, well and good, if it doesn't work out, well and good.

00:32:07.167 --> 00:32:11.997
It should not be assumed that once you are a realized soul

00:32:12.197 --> 00:32:17.877
that the whole world can fall at your feet.

00:32:18.267 --> 00:32:21.657
Not necessarily. It's a play.

00:32:21.857 --> 00:32:29.747
It's a beautiful enjoyment of the attention of the Adi Shakti.

00:32:29.947 --> 00:32:33.287
So if you can become the witness,

00:32:33.487 --> 00:32:37.057
if you can really become the witness of the whole thing,

00:32:37.257 --> 00:32:44.667
then what happens you grow spiritually much closer.

00:32:45.137 --> 00:32:50.857
I should say you get dissolved in the Divine Power.

00:32:51.057 --> 00:32:53.917
That dissolution has to take place.

00:32:54.117 --> 00:32:57.837
That's why today's puja is very important for you,

00:32:58.037 --> 00:33:03.577
because if it was not Adi Shakti Who had taken an incarnation,

00:33:03.777 --> 00:33:07.877
this work could not have been done.

00:33:08.087 --> 00:33:13.137
This could not have been. Because it had to be something

00:33:13.337 --> 00:33:25.237
that would encompass all the angularities of this human life,

00:33:25.447 --> 00:33:29.307
all the aspects of this human life.

00:33:29.507 --> 00:33:33.077
It had to be such an Incarnation

00:33:33.277 --> 00:33:41.267
that could absolutely see human being as a whole,

00:33:41.467 --> 00:33:45.787
not only his physical self, mental self, emotional self

00:33:45.987 --> 00:33:53.617
or his particular ideologies, or his particular domination - no,

00:33:53.817 --> 00:33:56.847
as a whole, as a human being.

00:33:57.047 --> 00:34:01.377
And human being, as I told you, is all inside,

00:34:01.577 --> 00:34:04.897
all of them are just the same.

00:34:05.107 --> 00:34:14.267
Some are more sensitive and seeking, genuinely,

00:34:14.467 --> 00:34:18.347
some are not seeking genuinely,

00:34:18.547 --> 00:34:21.997
and some are not seeking at all.

00:34:22.197 --> 00:34:27.087
But the seeking also is given to you by Adi Shakti.

00:34:27.297 --> 00:34:33.137
Now it happens that in the evolutionary process

00:34:33.337 --> 00:34:37.907
one fish came out of the mother.

00:34:38.107 --> 00:34:45.077
Out of that sea which was like a mother to the sea. It came out.

00:34:45.277 --> 00:34:50.597
And then about ten or twelve fishes came out.

00:34:50.797 --> 00:34:55.827
Then after some time, shoals of fishes came out.

00:34:56.227 --> 00:35:02.937
In the same manner your evolution has worked out.

00:35:03.437 --> 00:35:07.807
As it is, we think we have quite a big number,

00:35:08.007 --> 00:35:11.817
and we have crossed the number what we call, [inaudible]

00:35:12.017 --> 00:35:14.627
James or what St. John has said,

00:35:14.827 --> 00:35:17.677
we have already crossed it, doesn't matter.

00:35:17.867 --> 00:35:19.427
It doesn't matter.

00:35:19.627 --> 00:35:27.297
You see, it seems that it's a very fertile area, very fertile time,

00:35:27.507 --> 00:35:31.477
this Kali Yuga where there are so many people

00:35:31.677 --> 00:35:36.487
who are taking to Divinity. I mean it's the right time to do this.

00:35:36.687 --> 00:35:41.907
Yesterday when I saw your play, I have seen all that Myself

00:35:42.107 --> 00:35:46.107
and I used to wonder, "What is going to happen to these people,

00:35:46.307 --> 00:35:49.087
how are they going to take Sahaja Yoga?" They have,

00:35:49.287 --> 00:35:53.347
they have taken, they have taken to spirituality.

00:35:53.547 --> 00:35:57.507
See all these diverse things that you see in modern times

00:35:57.707 --> 00:35:59.687
should not disturb you much

00:35:59.887 --> 00:36:04.437
because that has to be that way. It's a drama, it's a play,

00:36:04.637 --> 00:36:08.487
and in that drama you should know that it will work out

00:36:08.687 --> 00:36:13.027
in such a beautiful manner that after some time

00:36:13.227 --> 00:36:19.077
you'll find nothing but the Divine dissolving

00:36:19.277 --> 00:36:23.267
all the useless things that we have,

00:36:23.467 --> 00:36:26.837
like our conditioning and our ego.

00:36:27.047 --> 00:36:30.067
We'll have so many people in Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:30.267 --> 00:36:33.987
By the time two thousand year, we'll have

00:36:34.187 --> 00:36:38.057
many, many Sahaja Yoga all over the world.

00:36:38.257 --> 00:36:42.497
Once we have lots of people, many would jump into it.

00:36:42.697 --> 00:36:44.437
That's human nature also.

00:36:44.637 --> 00:36:48.277
You see, they won't take to it till we have lots of people,

00:36:48.477 --> 00:36:52.007
and once we have a multitude they'll jump into it.

00:36:52.207 --> 00:36:55.787
So, some people are always worried "Mother, what about others?

00:36:55.987 --> 00:37:00.447
We are now in the heavens, we are enjoying life, what about others?"

00:37:00.647 --> 00:37:02.587
It will all work out.

00:37:02.787 --> 00:37:07.007
It will all work out, but your attention should be

00:37:07.207 --> 00:37:14.377
"how I can dissolve others into this ocean of joy,

00:37:14.577 --> 00:37:17.197
of this compassion?".

00:37:17.397 --> 00:37:22.727
Now you'll be surprised that it is your own compassion only

00:37:22.927 --> 00:37:26.457
which is going to give you strength.

00:37:26.657 --> 00:37:29.687
This compassion within you,

00:37:29.887 --> 00:37:33.467
when you will see people are getting completely drowned,

00:37:33.667 --> 00:37:36.947
completely destroyed,

00:37:37.147 --> 00:37:40.947
your compassion itself will make you powerful

00:37:41.147 --> 00:37:45.407
and you'll do everything that is needed.

00:37:45.607 --> 00:37:49.937
You'll give up all nonsensical activities

00:37:50.137 --> 00:37:58.307
and you will really dedicate yourself to emancipate other people.

00:37:58.577 --> 00:38:01.217
And amazingly as you will do this,

00:38:01.417 --> 00:38:06.207
your own level of spirituality will rise.

00:38:08.087 --> 00:38:11.037
As you see, I would say,

00:38:11.237 --> 00:38:16.537
that when you dissolve say some salt in the water,

00:38:16.737 --> 00:38:19.087
the water rises.

00:38:19.287 --> 00:38:25.357
In the same way, the more people when they will come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:38:25.557 --> 00:38:29.337
the Divine Power will manifest much more.

00:38:29.537 --> 00:38:33.947
It is manifesting already but the more people there will be,

00:38:34.147 --> 00:38:36.497
there will be much more manifestation

00:38:36.697 --> 00:38:42.937
because it will be like so many channels that will be working it out.

00:38:43.297 --> 00:38:49.817
So, at this juncture, when we all know that there is Divine Power,

00:38:50.017 --> 00:38:52.527
you all have got your Realization

00:38:52.727 --> 00:38:57.127
and that you are all now saintly people,

00:38:57.327 --> 00:39:00.727
then we should see to people who were like you.

00:39:00.927 --> 00:39:04.917
Like we had Sufis, then we had Nath Panthis,

00:39:05.117 --> 00:39:08.957
we had Gnostics, all kinds of people in every religion.

00:39:09.157 --> 00:39:14.547
What did they do? They went all out

00:39:14.747 --> 00:39:18.917
to awaken other people to the fact that there is Divine Power.

00:39:19.117 --> 00:39:21.197
They could not give realization as such,

00:39:21.397 --> 00:39:23.907
they couldn't give proof of that; but they worked it out,

00:39:24.107 --> 00:39:28.507
they talked about it, they sang about it.

00:39:28.707 --> 00:39:31.887
That's what we have to understand

00:39:32.117 --> 00:39:41.237
that nothing should deter your compassion to be expressed.

00:39:41.437 --> 00:39:43.727
When you know the people are getting drowned,

00:39:43.927 --> 00:39:49.197
they are in terrible mess, this is a kind of a huge,

00:39:49.397 --> 00:39:55.157
I should say,

00:39:55.357 --> 00:40:01.017
onslaught of the evil on human beings.

00:40:01.227 --> 00:40:04.267
And if you have that compassion within you,

00:40:04.477 --> 00:40:09.517
you will go all out to save them.

00:40:09.717 --> 00:40:15.677
That is what is the work of this chitvilas,

00:40:15.877 --> 00:40:20.747
of this enjoyment of your attention.

00:40:20.947 --> 00:40:24.257
Your attention itself will enjoy

00:40:24.457 --> 00:40:33.597
when you will start bringing more people into the Power of Divinity.

00:40:33.797 --> 00:40:36.827
Without Divinity there's no saving for human beings,

00:40:37.027 --> 00:40:40.347
that everybody admits, everybody says so;

00:40:40.547 --> 00:40:46.197
but they have no idea as to what is Divinity,

00:40:46.397 --> 00:40:52.707
what is the way to achieve it. While you all have this.

00:40:52.907 --> 00:40:55.387
You have power to awaken Kundalini.

00:40:55.587 --> 00:41:00.157
You know all about chakras, you know all the defects of the chakras,

00:41:00.357 --> 00:41:06.647
you can find out from the vibrations the truth about everything.

00:41:06.847 --> 00:41:11.947
The more you use this power the better it will be.

00:41:12.147 --> 00:41:17.067
So, you have to go to areas where so far you have not gone.

00:41:17.267 --> 00:41:21.257
For we haven't got many people from the black race

00:41:21.457 --> 00:41:23.387
I think, from Africa.

00:41:23.587 --> 00:41:27.917
So, I'm thinking of going next year to Africa to work it out.

00:41:28.117 --> 00:41:31.317
Also, we have so many other areas

00:41:31.517 --> 00:41:34.747
where I find we have to work it out,

00:41:34.947 --> 00:41:41.607
that if this compassion is within you

00:41:41.807 --> 00:41:44.147
then it will compel you, also,

00:41:44.347 --> 00:41:48.057
to do work that will bring solace to people

00:41:48.257 --> 00:41:50.977
who are not even seeking.

00:41:51.177 --> 00:41:56.317
I'm already busy with forming some NGO's you see,

00:41:56.517 --> 00:42:01.747
which will really create very beautiful institutions

00:42:01.947 --> 00:42:06.617
for people who have nothing - they are starving,

00:42:06.817 --> 00:42:10.857
they are under trouble, they are under great ordeals.

00:42:11.057 --> 00:42:15.697
Only you can do it because coming to Sahaja Yoga

00:42:15.897 --> 00:42:21.147
you have dropped out your greed,

00:42:21.347 --> 00:42:27.357
you have dropped out your lust.

00:42:27.557 --> 00:42:32.527
Is finished. Now you are so free and so independent.

00:42:32.737 --> 00:42:36.437
With this the compassion cannot take any other form,

00:42:36.637 --> 00:42:40.077
because many people I've seen that they start this kind of work

00:42:40.277 --> 00:42:42.167
and then they start becoming leaders,

00:42:42.367 --> 00:42:48.067
or they start becoming rich people or plundering others.

00:42:48.267 --> 00:42:51.127
This you will not do.

00:42:51.327 --> 00:42:58.357
You are the - really, as Christ has said, salt,

00:42:58.557 --> 00:43:04.787
salt which is completely dissolved in the Divinity

00:43:04.987 --> 00:43:11.227
and this salt is going to dissolve many others.

00:43:11.427 --> 00:43:15.497
Once we start spreading out like that,

00:43:15.697 --> 00:43:18.567
I am not saying we should be like missionaries or something,

00:43:18.777 --> 00:43:21.797
converting people into Sahaja Yoga by force, no.

00:43:21.997 --> 00:43:28.627
We have to look after what they are lacking first of all.

00:43:28.827 --> 00:43:32.457
Actually, there are very few people in this world who are honest,

00:43:32.657 --> 00:43:34.557
who don't have greed.

00:43:34.757 --> 00:43:37.697
I have known people who never had any greed,

00:43:37.897 --> 00:43:43.577
but as soon as they got some powers they started showing

00:43:43.777 --> 00:43:47.087
such tremendous greed that surprisingly,

00:43:47.317 --> 00:43:50.887
when you know that person, who has never done such a thing

00:43:51.087 --> 00:43:54.517
and suddenly you find he has become so greedy, you can't believe it.

00:43:54.717 --> 00:43:57.147
But not Sahaja Yogis.

00:43:57.347 --> 00:43:59.577
Sahaja Yogis won't do that.

00:43:59.777 --> 00:44:05.647
They'll enjoy their compassion, not anything else.

00:44:05.847 --> 00:44:08.997
Not their lust, not their greed

00:44:09.197 --> 00:44:12.917
and also the so-called deviations

00:44:13.117 --> 00:44:19.737
like taking to drugs and drinking and other nonsensical things.

00:44:20.017 --> 00:44:22.667
Because they know what do they enjoy,

00:44:22.867 --> 00:44:25.257
where lies their enjoyment.

00:44:25.457 --> 00:44:27.857
Once you know where lies the enjoyment,

00:44:28.057 --> 00:44:31.667
you will try to have more of it

00:44:31.867 --> 00:44:36.677
and more of it is so easy now for you to do it.

00:44:36.877 --> 00:44:39.787
I would say as the men are working it out,

00:44:39.987 --> 00:44:41.727
women should work it out

00:44:41.927 --> 00:44:47.287
because women have more sense of compassion,

00:44:47.487 --> 00:44:51.837
more sense of compassion, and forgiveness.

00:44:52.037 --> 00:44:55.037
- normal women, I am not saying about abnormal, you know,

00:44:55.237 --> 00:44:58.127
I'm saying about normal.

00:44:58.327 --> 00:45:03.587
It should be because they're mothers, they have children,

00:45:03.787 --> 00:45:08.287
they have known what is love for the children is.

00:45:08.487 --> 00:45:10.247
Mother doesn't expect anything.

00:45:10.447 --> 00:45:14.127
She just wants her child to be all right and happy.

00:45:14.327 --> 00:45:17.327
She enjoys her child, that's all.

00:45:17.527 --> 00:45:24.347
If you are a woman, in-built within you is this compassion.

00:45:24.557 --> 00:45:26.507
See, I have seen young girls.

00:45:26.707 --> 00:45:30.107
They too, if they find a little baby they'll all run after that.

00:45:30.317 --> 00:45:33.747
They'd like to take the little baby, they have dolls

00:45:33.947 --> 00:45:38.567
and they look after the dolls just like their own children.

00:45:38.777 --> 00:45:44.907
So for women it should be much easier to show compassion

00:45:45.107 --> 00:45:49.247
and to express and to manifest, it should be.

00:45:49.457 --> 00:45:53.747
And as you are all married also,

00:45:53.947 --> 00:45:58.957
your husbands will feel so much strengthened

00:45:59.157 --> 00:46:05.887
by your own nature of Divinity.

00:46:06.087 --> 00:46:08.207
What do you sacrifice? Some say,

00:46:08.417 --> 00:46:12.297
"I sacrifice this for God; I sacrifice that for God."

00:46:12.497 --> 00:46:16.337
What is there to sacrifice for God? What does God need?

00:46:16.537 --> 00:46:19.987
He doesn't need anything. What is there to sacrifice?

00:46:20.187 --> 00:46:23.737
Only you have sacrificed you brains, that's all I can say,

00:46:23.937 --> 00:46:26.967
no wisdom is there. Nothing to sacrifice.

00:46:27.167 --> 00:46:34.847
And if something

00:46:35.047 --> 00:46:37.347
has to be done, has to be done.

00:46:37.547 --> 00:46:39.727
I've seen also some ladies coming to me,

00:46:39.927 --> 00:46:43.477
"Mother, we have to cook, then we have to look after the children

00:46:43.677 --> 00:46:46.857
and the household and this and that".

00:46:47.057 --> 00:46:50.657
What's that? Otherwise, what will you do?

00:46:50.657 --> 00:46:53.387
The whole day, what will you do?

00:46:53.587 --> 00:46:57.137
Like the bats which hang themselves the whole day,

00:46:57.337 --> 00:47:01.187
are you going to hang yourself? You have to do something.

00:47:01.387 --> 00:47:05.607
While doing it is just nothing great, you know.

00:47:05.807 --> 00:47:10.757
And then to sacrifice, I don't know what are you going to sacrifice.

00:47:10.957 --> 00:47:16.607
Actually, what you are sacrificing is your joy, is your happiness.

00:47:16.807 --> 00:47:24.977
If you achieve that state of enjoying your own Self,

00:47:25.177 --> 00:47:29.117
then you'll be never tired.

00:47:29.317 --> 00:47:32.157
You will never grudge.

00:47:32.357 --> 00:47:37.617
You'll always say, "Mother, we are enjoying everything."

00:47:38.067 --> 00:47:41.857
This is a very important point that we should realize

00:47:42.057 --> 00:47:45.357
that if somebody is a woman or a man

00:47:45.557 --> 00:47:51.467
they have the same thing, which we call as Kundalini.

00:47:51.667 --> 00:47:56.507
But a woman, as it is, as you know, is mostly left sided.

00:47:56.707 --> 00:48:01.077
She has more power of compassion.

00:48:01.277 --> 00:48:04.597
In the same way the man has more power of action.

00:48:04.807 --> 00:48:07.797
So, the compassion has to become active.

00:48:07.997 --> 00:48:11.057
In this combination everything will work out

00:48:11.267 --> 00:48:13.537
in a very beautiful manner.

00:48:13.737 --> 00:48:18.517
But if that balance is not there, it's going to be difficult.

00:48:18.717 --> 00:48:23.487
I've seen most of the marriages we have had have been successful,

00:48:23.687 --> 00:48:26.747
but some of them have not been. Because, I think,

00:48:26.947 --> 00:48:28.927
some of the women have been men

00:48:29.127 --> 00:48:33.777
and some of the men have been women.

00:48:33.977 --> 00:48:38.347
And I'm really sometimes very unhappy,

00:48:38.557 --> 00:48:44.277
I get pain to see that unnecessarily they are creating problems.

00:48:44.477 --> 00:48:45.897
They are both Sahaja Yogis.

00:48:46.097 --> 00:48:48.637
If they were not Sahaja Yogis, I can understand.

00:48:48.837 --> 00:48:51.537
If a Sahaja Yogi is married to a non Sahaja Yogi, I can understand,

00:48:51.747 --> 00:48:53.537
but both are Sahaja Yogis.

00:48:53.747 --> 00:48:56.547
Now here you should understand the relationship

00:48:56.757 --> 00:49:01.057
of the God Almighty and Adi Shakti.

00:49:01.257 --> 00:49:07.227
Is complete unision (sic.) , complete understanding.

00:49:07.437 --> 00:49:09.727
God Almighty is the Spectator;

00:49:09.927 --> 00:49:14.687
He's watching the work of the Adi Shakti.

00:49:14.887 --> 00:49:17.297
She is compassion, of course.

00:49:17.497 --> 00:49:21.277
She doesn't say that something should be destroyed

00:49:21.477 --> 00:49:24.897
or something should be killed, all right, She's compassion.

00:49:25.097 --> 00:49:29.197
But He's the One who takes charge.

00:49:29.397 --> 00:49:34.437
If somebody tries to do something against the Adi Shakti,

00:49:34.637 --> 00:49:38.707
it is He who takes charge and changes the whole scene

00:49:38.907 --> 00:49:43.807
in such a manner that you don't understand how it has happened,

00:49:44.017 --> 00:49:47.307
how it has worked out.

00:49:47.507 --> 00:49:51.557
What you have to do is to enjoy the play.

00:49:51.757 --> 00:49:55.827
In the same manner, Sahaja Yogis should have a unision (sic.),

00:49:56.027 --> 00:50:00.517
should have understanding, enjoyment among yourselves.

00:50:00.717 --> 00:50:06.047
If a Sahaja Yogi cannot enjoy, who is going to enjoy life?

00:50:06.247 --> 00:50:08.017
I can't understand

00:50:08.217 --> 00:50:12.057
the one who has his Kundalini awakened only,

00:50:12.267 --> 00:50:18.937
who has felt the all-pervading power of love,

00:50:19.137 --> 00:50:22.937
who knows what is the truth,

00:50:23.137 --> 00:50:32.037
who is standing on the complete oneness with the Divine,

00:50:32.237 --> 00:50:41.227
how can such a person anyway have any kind of problem?

00:50:42.917 --> 00:50:46.637
It is to realize

00:50:46.837 --> 00:50:55.087
that you are sitting in the realm of God Almighty.

00:50:55.387 --> 00:50:59.327
You have entered into His kingdom

00:50:59.527 --> 00:51:05.867
and you are under the attention, compassion of Adi Shakti.

00:51:06.067 --> 00:51:09.337
But it is like this, if you make a beggar

00:51:09.537 --> 00:51:12.217
who has been begging all his life sit on a throne,

00:51:12.417 --> 00:51:16.097
he still begs sitting on this throne.

00:51:16.297 --> 00:51:20.097
So that is sometimes is the situation with Sahaja Yogis.

00:51:20.297 --> 00:51:22.967
I receive some funny letters sometimes

00:51:23.167 --> 00:51:27.707
then I start wondering if this fellow is still in the limbo state,

00:51:27.907 --> 00:51:33.177
is not yet a Sahaja Yogi nor a human being, in between somewhere, hanging.

00:51:33.377 --> 00:51:39.277
So, at least, that state should be overcome by all of you,

00:51:39.487 --> 00:51:41.847
because it has a very bad impression,

00:51:42.047 --> 00:51:47.297
also, for other people and for your own life.

00:51:47.497 --> 00:51:51.137
For your own life, is very important

00:51:51.337 --> 00:51:55.517
that you should grow fully into the understanding

00:51:55.717 --> 00:52:01.647
of the powers that you have got and the love that your Mother has.

00:52:01.847 --> 00:52:05.917
When you say you must surrender yourself to Mother, means what?

00:52:06.117 --> 00:52:10.247
What do you have to surrender?

00:52:11.817 --> 00:52:14.687
Just think of it.

00:52:14.887 --> 00:52:22.217
What you are surrendering is what is perverting you,

00:52:22.417 --> 00:52:28.527
whatever is destructing you, whatever that misleads you,

00:52:28.727 --> 00:52:35.307
whatever is your ego and your conditioning.

00:52:35.507 --> 00:52:40.297
That's all you are surrendering, just to purify yourself,

00:52:40.497 --> 00:52:45.287
to enjoy yourself and to know God Almighty.

00:52:45.487 --> 00:52:48.537
If you don't know your Self, how will you know God also?

00:52:48.737 --> 00:52:50.277
Impossible.

00:52:50.477 --> 00:52:55.547
So to know your Self you have to evolve.

00:52:55.747 --> 00:52:58.317
I know there are some very great Sahaja Yogis,

00:52:58.517 --> 00:53:01.727
some Sahaja Yoginis also. Many are there,

00:53:01.927 --> 00:53:08.447
but still I would say that there are so many other areas

00:53:08.647 --> 00:53:12.467
where all these very greatly evolved Sahaja Yogis

00:53:12.667 --> 00:53:19.007
have to enter into and work out.

00:53:19.207 --> 00:53:20.727
You can do it.

00:53:20.927 --> 00:53:26.187
You see, I was surprised that in this place

00:53:26.387 --> 00:53:31.577
when I came first in Rome we had advertised,

00:53:31.777 --> 00:53:36.207
and there was not even a single person in the hall.

00:53:36.407 --> 00:53:39.447
So I said, "Baba, what is going to happen in this country?"

00:53:39.647 --> 00:53:46.467
Now we have so many Sahaja Yogis. Unbelievable!

00:53:46.667 --> 00:53:52.247
But as it is growing sideways, it should also grow upwards.

00:53:52.447 --> 00:53:55.497
As it is growing in quantity,

00:53:55.697 --> 00:53:59.407
it should also grow in quality.

00:53:59.607 --> 00:54:04.467
And as you grow in quality, more and more people will come.

00:54:04.667 --> 00:54:06.777
Because I know all the time

00:54:06.987 --> 00:54:09.827
you are so collective that you, all the time, you feel,

00:54:10.027 --> 00:54:13.307
"Mother, you see, my uncle is still not a Sahaja Yogi.

00:54:13.507 --> 00:54:17.657
See Mother, my brother is not yet a Sahaja Yogi."

00:54:17.857 --> 00:54:19.867
I know that feeling you have that,

00:54:20.067 --> 00:54:23.497
"My father, still he is not a Sahaja Yogi."

00:54:23.697 --> 00:54:25.567
So forget about them.

00:54:25.777 --> 00:54:32.497
But those who are seeking, approach them.

00:54:32.707 --> 00:54:34.857
They are your real relations.

00:54:35.057 --> 00:54:38.967
Then afterwards, when all these people will join -

00:54:39.167 --> 00:54:42.867
your father, mother, brothers, sisters, children,

00:54:43.067 --> 00:54:46.107
all of them will jump in. They are that type.

00:54:46.307 --> 00:54:50.507
They will wait and wait and wait. They are not seekers.

00:54:50.707 --> 00:54:54.447
But those who are seekers, you should seek them.

00:54:54.647 --> 00:54:57.357
You should find out where are they.

00:54:57.557 --> 00:55:00.267
My attention is, of course, is with you

00:55:00.467 --> 00:55:05.247
and every time you think of Me I'll be at your service fully.

00:55:05.457 --> 00:55:06.857
Whatever you want,

00:55:07.057 --> 00:55:11.547
I will be there to help you whichever way is possible.

00:55:11.747 --> 00:55:17.107
Anything you find very difficult, it's not.

00:55:17.317 --> 00:55:20.327
Because you take it upon yourself.

00:55:20.527 --> 00:55:26.067
But if you leave it to this All Pervading Power of Divine Love,

00:55:26.267 --> 00:55:33.427
to this power of Adi Shakti, Paramchaitanya, nothing is difficult,

00:55:33.637 --> 00:55:40.197
nothing is so bad that you cannot manage.

00:55:40.917 --> 00:55:44.147
I don't know if I have to talk about this Adi Shakti

00:55:44.347 --> 00:55:48.187
it will take at least ten hours minimum.

00:55:48.387 --> 00:55:52.377
So, I think I'd better stop now and we should keep something

00:55:52.587 --> 00:55:55.627
for the next Adi Shakti Puja. Somebody asked me,

00:55:55.837 --> 00:55:58.027
"Is it necessary to have this puja?"

00:55:58.227 --> 00:56:01.227
I think if there's any puja that you should do, is this one,

00:56:01.427 --> 00:56:02.917
is Adi Shakti.

00:56:03.117 --> 00:56:06.417
It's very important that this puja must be performed

00:56:06.617 --> 00:56:12.687
because that is how you grow, this reflection improves

00:56:12.887 --> 00:56:15.847
and you grow more and more within yourself

00:56:16.047 --> 00:56:20.777
through the power of Adi Shakti or through the power of Kundalini.

00:56:20.977 --> 00:56:25.777
As you know that Adi Shakti has Her own Kundalini

00:56:25.977 --> 00:56:28.457
which is the Adi Kundalini and the reflection of that

00:56:28.657 --> 00:56:32.487
within you is the Kundalini.

00:56:32.687 --> 00:56:33.937
So, you have to worship.

00:56:34.137 --> 00:56:38.297
And is the best way to please your own Kundalini,

00:56:38.497 --> 00:56:41.867
your own Mother who has given you this birth.

00:56:42.067 --> 00:56:45.567
May God bless you.
