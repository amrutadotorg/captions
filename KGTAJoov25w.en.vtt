00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.020
Christmas Puja, Ganapatipule (India),
25 December 2003.

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:34.902
Today is a great day because we are celebrating

00:06:35.151 --> 00:06:40.069
the birth of Jesus Christ.

00:06:43.401 --> 00:06:51.985
He was such a great spiritual personality,

00:06:54.193 --> 00:06:59.944
who had to suffer on the cross.

00:07:02.235 --> 00:07:06.652
This is what many people don't understand,

00:07:07.902 --> 00:07:13.610
that why a man of his calibre, of his standing,

00:07:14.944 --> 00:07:17.069
of his spirituality,

00:07:17.902 --> 00:07:23.027
should have to go through so many ordeals in life.

00:07:28.318 --> 00:07:32.527
It is very easy to understand

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:37.193
that he was born in a circumstances

00:07:38.401 --> 00:07:40.819
which was against him,

00:07:41.401 --> 00:07:45.902
which were against divine force.

00:07:47.527 --> 00:07:57.401
So to overcome that people tried to destroy Jesus Christ.

00:08:00.401 --> 00:08:06.027
And he did not feel the pain,

00:08:06.318 --> 00:08:11.110
he didn't feel the absurdity of those people.

00:08:12.401 --> 00:08:17.318
On the contrary he went through all that ordeal

00:08:18.401 --> 00:08:22.527
with such courage and such dignity.

00:08:25.819 --> 00:08:30.819
So for us, what is there to see is

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:36.610
that if you are divine

00:08:36.902 --> 00:08:40.401
and if you have powers of divinity,

00:08:41.735 --> 00:08:47.819
then you should have courage,

00:08:48.944 --> 00:08:52.944
and with that courage you can face all kinds of ordeals.

00:08:54.235 --> 00:09:00.443
On the whole, whenever you are on this earth

00:09:01.443 --> 00:09:04.944
there are problems of different types.

00:09:06.027 --> 00:09:09.027
You may belong to royal families,

00:09:09.318 --> 00:09:12.527
or may be a poor person,

00:09:12.819 --> 00:09:19.027
there are always problems facing you.

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:26.610
But Christ has shown by his life

00:09:27.027 --> 00:09:29.610
that though he had to suffer so much,

00:09:30.944 --> 00:09:34.318
he was so patient and courageous.

00:09:36.318 --> 00:09:40.235
His life has given us an example,

00:09:40.527 --> 00:09:45.652
what we should be, how we should behave

00:09:46.318 --> 00:09:52.527
when we are facing problems because of ignorance of people.

00:09:56.151 --> 00:10:02.735
But today is a happy day because it is his birth date

00:10:03.027 --> 00:10:06.235
and we are all celebrating

00:10:06.527 --> 00:10:10.735
because he has shown us a new path of spirituality

00:10:11.652 --> 00:10:14.027
in which one has to suffer,

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:20.527
because of the ignorance of many who are there,

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:23.360
he suffered so much.

00:10:23.652 --> 00:10:25.944
But today it's not so bad,

00:10:26.235 --> 00:10:32.860
people understand spirituality and divinity.

00:10:34.151 --> 00:10:36.735
And you are so many together now.

00:10:41.235 --> 00:10:48.360
In these sufferings Christ never cried or wept.

00:10:50.151 --> 00:10:56.235
He went through it in a very resolute manner.

00:10:58.235 --> 00:11:01.235
So what we have to learn from his life is

00:11:01.568 --> 00:11:04.027
that we should not be afraid.

00:11:04.652 --> 00:11:09.151
Whatever might be happening to us,

00:11:09.443 --> 00:11:11.652
we should not be afraid.

00:11:11.944 --> 00:11:14.235
But times have changed

00:11:14.568 --> 00:11:17.735
and people don't torture anyone

00:11:18.069 --> 00:11:20.735
because of your spirituality.

00:11:22.069 --> 00:11:25.069
It's not there, it's finished.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:31.069
Christ wiped out all that from human minds,

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:35.360
and people respect you for being spiritual.

00:11:36.652 --> 00:11:41.069
This is the message of Christ's life,

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:45.944
and we all should be very happy

00:11:47.276 --> 00:11:53.860
that he has shown us this path of ignorance.

00:11:58.443 --> 00:12:02.652
The message of Sahaja Yoga is the same:

00:12:04.568 --> 00:12:08.777
that you take your realisation,

00:12:10.069 --> 00:12:12.360
you take to spiritual life,

00:12:12.652 --> 00:12:15.360
and everything will work out

00:12:15.652 --> 00:12:19.276
because all the divine forces are with you.

00:12:20.568 --> 00:12:23.276
They are working out everything for you

00:12:23.568 --> 00:12:28.568
and you are so many who can say that you have witnessed it.

00:12:30.568 --> 00:12:34.568
So this kind of life that Christ had,

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:38.485
you don't have to go through, he has done for us.

00:12:39.777 --> 00:12:46.860
Your life will be very, very safe and peaceful and joyous.

00:12:47.568 --> 00:12:51.069
That is without my telling you,

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.652
you must have experience.

00:12:55.985 --> 00:12:59.069
These days there are also very cruel people,

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:04.276
very absurd and extremely aggressive,

00:13:04.568 --> 00:13:09.777
but still, no-one can harm you.

00:13:10.193 --> 00:13:12.777
Life has become very different.

00:13:14.069 --> 00:13:18.860
And we thank Christ that he has gone through all that

00:13:19.193 --> 00:13:23.568
to save us from those ordeals.

00:13:31.777 --> 00:13:37.276
Today is the birthday of Christ and

00:13:37.568 --> 00:13:42.485
we are all celebrating His birthday with great joy.

00:13:42.777 --> 00:13:50.485
And we also know  that Jesus Christ took a lot of efforts,

00:13:50.777 --> 00:13:54.985
and we do not have such efforts as much as He has done.

00:13:55.193 --> 00:13:57.485
But how much Jesus Christ has suffered...We know this.

00:13:57.777 --> 00:14:00.276
But we do not have this kind of efforts,

00:14:00.568 --> 00:14:05.401
because the whole human community has changed.

00:14:05.693 --> 00:14:10.693
And in this changed human community,

00:14:10.985 --> 00:14:17.193
spiritual life is very, very important.

00:14:17.693 --> 00:14:24.401
From this spiritual life  many obstacles have been removed,

00:14:24.693 --> 00:14:29.276
from this we can solve our physical problems,

00:14:33.568 --> 00:14:37.276
we can solve our mental problems,

00:14:37.568 --> 00:14:42.276
we can solve household problems,

00:14:42.568 --> 00:14:44.693
we can solve the problems of the whole world.

00:14:44.985 --> 00:14:50.069
In this way the life of the whole mankind

00:14:50.401 --> 00:14:53.276
can be changed into a spiritual life.

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:57.693
This is very important for us to know,

00:14:57.985 --> 00:15:01.276
that on the  one hand there was Jesus Christ

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:03.985
who had gained a lot in spirituality,

00:15:04.276 --> 00:15:10.193
and on the other hand we have

00:15:10.485 --> 00:15:15.401
gained a small part of spirituality

00:15:15.693 --> 00:15:18.902
- and because of us the world is becoming silent.

00:15:19.193 --> 00:15:26.276
Many problems are getting solved

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:30.318
and mankind has understood

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:33.318
that it's very important to take to spiritual life.

00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:37.985
This kind of changes are because of you people,

00:15:38.318 --> 00:15:40.819
I alone cannot do anything.

00:15:40.985 --> 00:15:45.610
I am in the same situation as Jesus.

00:15:45.902 --> 00:15:51.485
To what extent can I act?

00:15:51.819 --> 00:15:55.485
Now there are many people.

00:15:55.819 --> 00:16:00.610
Now we can see

00:16:01.485 --> 00:16:09.985
how the whole world has changed.

00:16:10.318 --> 00:16:14.693
Because of you, problems are getting solved,

00:16:15.693 --> 00:16:22.193
many changes have come,

00:16:22.527 --> 00:16:29.193
Many changes are coming,

00:16:29.527 --> 00:16:35.693
not only for one person,

00:16:37.027 --> 00:16:41.693
for thousands, for the whole world,

00:16:42.401 --> 00:16:45.027
in the whole community changes are coming.

00:16:45.318 --> 00:16:51.401
These things you are all doing, which is very important.

00:16:57.193 --> 00:17:02.401
Now to speak in Marathi, the life of Christ was very sad.

00:17:02.693 --> 00:17:14.401
But he did all this kind of things with love,

00:17:14.735 --> 00:17:19.735
because He was a very great soul

00:17:20.027 --> 00:17:30.401
- such a kind of person does not feel any kind of sadness.

00:17:30.735 --> 00:17:34.902
In this way we have taken to spiritual life,

00:17:35.235 --> 00:17:39.735
and now we have to give the spiritual life to everyone.

00:17:40.027 --> 00:17:44.902
People are watching our lives and  they are stunned  by seeing

00:17:45.235 --> 00:17:46.902
how happy we are.

00:17:47.527 --> 00:17:50.902
And when they understand that

00:17:51.235 --> 00:17:53.401
these things are happening in Sahaja Yoga

00:17:53.735 --> 00:17:55.819
they also enter Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:58.819
This is a very good thing

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:01.819
and also you have got this blessing.

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:04.110
And you have to keep this blessing very carefully.

00:18:04.443 --> 00:18:07.443
You have to work on it, and the most important

00:18:07.735 --> 00:18:13.527
thing is that you have to give this thing to everyone.

00:18:13.819 --> 00:18:18.110
You all are getting this kind of blessing

00:18:18.443 --> 00:18:22.944
- now let also other people have this kind of joy,

00:18:23.235 --> 00:18:28.318
and so all the Sahaja Yogis have to try

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:32.944
to give Sahaja Yoga to everyone.

00:18:34.235 --> 00:18:38.443
In the whole world Sahaja yoga has spread but it is very little.

00:18:38.735 --> 00:18:40.443
It should be spread much more.

00:18:40.735 --> 00:18:46.652
Jesus Christ had only twelve devotees,

00:18:46.944 --> 00:18:52.318
and these twelve devotees had spread Christianity

00:18:52.652 --> 00:18:57.443
- but there are many mistakes made.

00:18:57.735 --> 00:19:00.819
In this way you have to bear in mind that

00:19:01.151 --> 00:19:06.819
when we spread Sahaja Yoga we should not make any mistake.

00:19:07.151 --> 00:19:14.235
We should spread it in a very simple way. It is not so difficult.

00:19:14.527 --> 00:19:16.027
In this thing,

00:19:16.527 --> 00:19:23.235
Parameshwara has given you the Shakti

00:19:23.527 --> 00:19:27.235
and the brains, use it. I have full faith in you,

00:19:27.443 --> 00:19:30.235
that you can make many Sahaja Yogis

00:19:30.527 --> 00:19:33.944
and you should try to give Sahaja Yoga to everyone

00:19:34.235 --> 00:19:39.151
and only think day and night who to give Sahaja Yoga to.

00:19:39.443 --> 00:19:43.652
I am blessing you for this,

00:19:43.944 --> 00:19:45.860
so this is a very big responsibility on you.

00:19:46.151 --> 00:19:48.652
Since you took to Sahaja Yoga, you had this responsibility,

00:19:48.944 --> 00:19:51.235
that from today you have to bear in mind

00:19:51.568 --> 00:19:54.860
that you have to give Sahaja Yoga to everyone

00:19:55.069 --> 00:19:56.860
and should not keep this thing just within us.

00:19:57.151 --> 00:20:00.735
May God bless you
