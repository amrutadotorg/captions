WEBVTT

00:00.198 --> 00:03.579
Birthday Puja March 21, 1998
Delhi, India

08:47.534 --> 08:56.078
I was overjoyed to see

08:56.159 --> 09:04.077
the way you had organized this beautiful welcome.

09:07.607 --> 09:14.187
I must say that it’s your love which finds

09:14.294 --> 09:25.012
all kind of expressions of enjoying Sahaja Yoga.

09:26.423 --> 09:35.232
I really can’t understand how these unique ideas

09:35.558 --> 09:43.581
come to your heads, and you represent

09:43.618 --> 09:49.321
the different countries from where you have come.

09:50.303 --> 09:58.419
I wish you carry these flags back to
your own countries,

09:58.649 --> 10:03.605
and tell them the message that the time has come

10:03.898 --> 10:10.422
for our resurrection, that we have to rise.

10:10.883 --> 10:16.489
We have to rise above this human level

10:16.751 --> 10:20.314
to a higher level of existence.

10:20.481 --> 10:26.269
And if that happens, then how it changes your life,

10:26.690 --> 10:34.970
how it makes you happy,
how you lose all your absurd ideas of hatred

10:35.217 --> 10:48.324
and of harming others, injuring others: all this kind of ideas

10:48.601 --> 10:56.488
which have worked out to give some sort of
a sadistic pleasure to many people,

10:56.559 --> 11:05.817
and they have enjoyed the way they want to destroy

11:06.294 --> 11:10.714
the joy of others, the happiness of others.

11:11.657 --> 11:18.503
To maintain the happiness, I know, you being Sahaja Yogis,

11:18.654 --> 11:25.290
you have to bear a lot, tolerate a lot of nonsense.

11:25.348 --> 11:31.352
You have already done it, and gradually once

11:31.471 --> 11:37.778
Sahaja Yoga is established in your own countries as something

11:38.238 --> 11:43.031
that is so beautiful, so very pure,

11:43.167 --> 11:48.717
so very important that all others in your countries

11:48.742 --> 11:57.298
also will try to follow that path which you have crossed over.

11:57.642 --> 12:02.243
Only your lives are the ones which will reflect

12:02.313 --> 12:08.492
the beauty of your inner being and of Sahaja Yoga.

12:10.368 --> 12:15.945
I told you yesterday what was missing in the human awareness,

12:15.993 --> 12:20.279
and that the attention was not on the Spirit.

12:21.408 --> 12:27.441
But when it is on the Spirit, what happens to you?

12:27.623 --> 12:35.577
Firstly you become according to Sanskrit words, gunatit:

12:36.651 --> 12:40.260
you go beyond all the three gunas.

12:40.567 --> 12:49.619
That means you are no more a person who is tamo guni,

12:49.644 --> 13:00.801
means the one who has got all kinds of desires of self-indulgence.

13:02.183 --> 13:07.543
Your attention moves from there to the second style

13:07.630 --> 13:11.919
where you are rajo guni, the right-sidedness:

13:11.944 --> 13:14.852
they want to do something, want to show something,

13:14.892 --> 13:19.430
you want to become something, you want to compete with others.

13:19.523 --> 13:22.398
All this struggle just disappears.

13:22.740 --> 13:25.558
"Atit" means beyond.

13:25.740 --> 13:31.494
Then sattwa guni: that is also where you are seeking,

13:31.701 --> 13:37.180
where you see that what’s wrong in this kind of extreme behavior,

13:37.307 --> 13:41.012
and you just hate that kind of life

13:41.037 --> 13:46.567
and you want to get out of it, and then you start seeking.

13:47.132 --> 13:49.403
That also is finished.

13:49.625 --> 13:56.431
All the gunas are finished, so you become gunatit.

13:57.073 --> 14:03.616
It just happens when your attention goes to your Spirit,

14:03.871 --> 14:11.104
because now the attention is not on any one of your inherent,

14:11.129 --> 14:17.317
you can say, or conditioned qualities, or of egoistical qualities.

14:18.308 --> 14:25.146
So you become a person who is beyond this.

14:26.811 --> 14:33.028
This is something very remarkable as far as

14:33.053 --> 14:37.717
for normal life, but for you it is not, it just happens.

14:37.837 --> 14:40.488
You just enjoy being yourself.

14:40.925 --> 14:47.057
You’re no more concerned about your own conveniences,
comforts and petty things.

14:47.123 --> 14:51.725
But what happens is that you just go beyond

14:51.828 --> 14:55.487
all these three gunas which have been

14:55.655 --> 15:01.151
dominating you this way or that way.

15:04.466 --> 15:11.275
So that’s how you cross the limit of human awareness, firstly.

15:12.209 --> 15:22.236
Then the second one is, you become kalatit: you go beyond time.

15:22.575 --> 15:26.615
I know today I was late somehow.

15:27.021 --> 15:29.307
It just works out that way.

15:29.332 --> 15:31.630
But you didn’t miss the time.

15:31.655 --> 15:35.410
You were still enjoying.
I could see, sitting in the house,

15:35.537 --> 15:38.281
that you are all in a very enjoyable mood,

15:38.306 --> 15:41.319
all of you are enjoying nicely.

15:41.344 --> 15:45.239
I’m not here, but still you are enjoying.

15:45.452 --> 15:47.762
This is beyond time.

15:47.787 --> 15:50.133
You’re not bound by time.

15:50.158 --> 15:54.107
Whatever is the time is your own, because

15:54.274 --> 15:56.837
you are standing in the present,

15:57.260 --> 16:02.468
you are not standing here and thinking of the future.

16:02.779 --> 16:06.127
You didn’t think about what will happen tomorrow

16:06.152 --> 16:10.104
or how will you catch your plane, or how will you do this.

16:10.129 --> 16:12.373
Here you were just enjoying,

16:12.413 --> 16:17.270
enjoying the present, and the present is the reality.

16:17.889 --> 16:22.199
If you are thinking of the future or of the past,

16:22.286 --> 16:25.453
then you are not in reality.
I have told many-a-times

16:25.667 --> 16:28.777
that past is finished and future doesn’t exist.

16:28.802 --> 16:32.806
So at this moment you are here sitting,

16:32.894 --> 16:36.775
perhaps may be waiting for Me, may be

16:36.838 --> 16:41.132
just enjoying every moment of your stay here,

16:41.236 --> 16:44.434
of your connections with others.

16:44.879 --> 16:48.458
And this enjoyment cannot be described,

16:48.538 --> 16:51.616
how you are enjoying this.

16:52.537 --> 16:55.593
Otherwise people would be seeing the watch,

16:55.665 --> 16:58.315
wondering, “Why Mother has not come?

16:58.349 --> 17:00.180
What is the problem?

17:00.205 --> 17:06.657
Why She is not arrived?” and all kinds of ideas can go round.

17:07.022 --> 17:10.543
It helps a lot to be kalatit.

17:10.804 --> 17:15.420
I remember in Nasik I had to work very hard because

17:15.445 --> 17:18.673
no Sahaja Yogi would come forward to do anything,

17:18.698 --> 17:22.059
they were so shy and so much worried.

17:22.850 --> 17:26.832
And it so happened, luckily or unluckily we can say,

17:26.952 --> 17:29.594
that My car failed on the way and

17:29.661 --> 17:33.433
I was delayed in going.

17:33.669 --> 17:41.370
About one hour passed, there was no car coming that way,
there’s no way to go,

17:41.640 --> 17:44.595
and we were stranded on the road.

17:44.691 --> 17:48.616
Now surprisingly, when I reached the place

17:48.647 --> 17:54.535
where we were going to have the program,
the Sahaja Yogis took over.

17:54.705 --> 17:59.723
They took the responsibility, and they were very busy

18:00.358 --> 18:03.717
giving Realizations to others and working it out.

18:03.742 --> 18:05.614
Otherwise they would not.

18:05.639 --> 18:08.999
They could not believe that they have power to give Realization.

18:09.110 --> 18:12.591
I may tell them, but they would not raise their hands.

18:12.620 --> 18:18.987
And just because the time was there
and they thought, “So many people are here,

18:19.012 --> 18:24.683
Mother is not coming or She may be coming,
so it’s our responsibility.”

18:24.837 --> 18:28.247
In that way they took the responsibility.

18:28.295 --> 18:33.705
So when you are beyond the time,
you become responsible for that moment.

18:34.740 --> 18:39.209
It’s such a responsibility which is also collective,

18:39.566 --> 18:44.458
means you just all of you become responsible.

18:46.156 --> 18:49.530
It’s very surprising, we are so many here,

18:49.570 --> 18:52.993
there’s no quarrel, no fight, nothing.

18:53.144 --> 18:57.880
We are very nicely settled down, just beyond

18:57.905 --> 19:03.110
all kinds of stupid ideas of attacking each other.

19:03.269 --> 19:10.408
That happens because you are not involved with the time.

19:10.559 --> 19:13.032
The time cannot bow you down.

19:13.172 --> 19:17.035
Perhaps if it were not you people, some other people,

19:17.146 --> 19:20.470
they would have thrown stones on My car,

19:20.495 --> 19:26.232
thinking,  “So it is so late She comes,
we are here boiling in the heat.”

19:26.347 --> 19:28.657
They would have resented.

19:28.682 --> 19:32.081
But not the people who are beyond time.

19:32.359 --> 19:35.330
They are nicely sitting down, enjoying themselves.

19:35.601 --> 19:41.051
It doesn’t matter, the time passes on.

19:42.542 --> 19:48.828
Then you become dharmatit: you become beyond dharma,

19:49.693 --> 19:56.860
beyond your human nature.

19:58.014 --> 20:02.276
That means whatever you do is religious,

20:04.467 --> 20:09.035
whatever is your endeavor is religious.

20:10.480 --> 20:13.797
If, say, you are in a business,

20:14.035 --> 20:18.058
you would like to do business in a religious manner,

20:18.161 --> 20:23.068
because you are beyond religion you are not bothered as to

20:23.108 --> 20:27.520
follow a particular pattern or ritual of any religion,

20:27.902 --> 20:30.139
but you are beyond it.

20:30.274 --> 20:39.034
Like people who are, you see, not beyond religion:

20:39.502 --> 20:44.032
they must get up early in the morning,  they are bound

20:44.524 --> 20:49.221
by their rituals and they pass through the rituals,

20:49.246 --> 20:54.069
and if one of the rituals is not done
they are very unhappy and shaken up.

20:54.211 --> 20:55.731
But not you.

20:55.835 --> 20:58.955
For you, you are always in dhyan,

20:59.019 --> 21:03.582
always in meditative mood, and anything goes wrong

21:03.783 --> 21:06.809
you just jump into that awareness

21:06.889 --> 21:11.177
where you get the solution, and you are not disturbed,

21:11.394 --> 21:16.604
not disturbed at all when things go wrong.

21:16.794 --> 21:22.360
Like ritualistic nature makes you very constricted,

21:22.534 --> 21:26.740
very docile, sometimes can be aggressive also.

21:27.003 --> 21:31.246
People with their ritualism trouble others a lot.

21:31.472 --> 21:36.951
Like one lady who was supposed to be our friend came to My house.

21:37.241 --> 21:40.374
So she said, "I’m a vegetarian."
I said, "Then?"

21:40.453 --> 21:46.833
"But I can’t eat the food in which non–veg. food has been cooked."

21:47.545 --> 21:48.714
"All right.

21:48.739 --> 21:51.910
So we’ll have to get new utensils."

21:51.935 --> 21:54.884
So I went and bought new utensils for her.

21:54.917 --> 21:57.841
So she said that "You have to be careful

21:57.921 --> 22:02.722
that even the spoon should not be used."

22:02.817 --> 22:05.879
So I had to go and get for her a spoon.

22:05.904 --> 22:12.361
Then she said, "Tumblers; because people are taking food here

22:12.634 --> 22:15.539
who are eating non–veg. food,

22:15.641 --> 22:21.116
so you better get us something which is absolutely new."

22:21.300 --> 22:24.168
So I had to incur all these problems.

22:24.414 --> 22:28.078
And then she was in the kitchen and she wouldn’t allow

22:28.156 --> 22:30.285
our cook to cook anything for us.

22:30.340 --> 22:33.676
She said, "First I will cook, and then you can cook."

22:33.779 --> 22:36.921
And she made such a nuisance out of her

22:36.992 --> 22:41.127
that instead of being a guest she became a pest,

22:41.647 --> 22:45.351
and this is what happens to people who are ritualistic,

22:45.398 --> 22:47.883
because they are very demanding.

22:47.907 --> 22:51.633
They go on demanding that “This is our dharma.”

22:51.854 --> 22:57.697
I know of another story was told to Me by somebody in Bombay.

22:57.829 --> 23:01.631
She said, "This lady who came to me as a guest, because

23:01.710 --> 23:05.059
she was related to something very high up,

23:05.298 --> 23:09.731
she was worse than my great-great-great-grandmother."

23:09.826 --> 23:11.566
I said, "Really?"

23:11.591 --> 23:15.192
She said, "I can’t understand that in India

23:15.247 --> 23:17.739
we have such people still living.

23:17.771 --> 23:22.832
She came here and she said, ‘I cannot take water from the tap.

23:23.027 --> 23:26.787
You have to get it from some sort of a well.’

23:27.083 --> 23:30.574
“Now, there are only two wells in Bombay.

23:30.622 --> 23:34.143
So people had to go and fetch the water,

23:34.218 --> 23:38.908
but the cook had to be completely drenched in water

23:38.933 --> 23:41.290
and then only he could cook.

23:41.315 --> 23:44.724
“‘Because if he cooks without that, then I won’t eat.’

23:45.169 --> 23:49.235
“And she went on, and on, and on there, and

23:49.325 --> 23:51.689
the cook got sick with pneumonia,

23:51.714 --> 23:55.618
another cook came and he got flu, you see?

23:55.643 --> 23:56.890
This lady didn’t mind.

23:56.890 --> 23:59.090
“She said, ‘No, that’s my style.’"

23:59.090 --> 24:03.369
So she asked Me, "What should we do with such people, Mother?"

24:03.394 --> 24:06.475
I said, "You should have asked her
that ‘We have this thing.

24:06.500 --> 24:09.445
If you like it well and good; otherwise you don’t eat,

24:09.470 --> 24:13.633
it’s all right, good. Fasting is a very good thing.’

24:14.427 --> 24:19.206
That’s the only solution for such people who are so self-centered

24:19.231 --> 24:22.714
and so much bothering others.”

24:22.762 --> 24:25.827
So this self-centeredness comes to us

24:25.843 --> 24:28.700
because we think, "This is our dharma,

24:28.725 --> 24:33.330
this is our right, this is - everything belongs to us.

24:33.355 --> 24:36.235
How dare they do not do it?"

24:36.260 --> 24:40.744
How much we trouble others, how much we make them inconvenient,

24:40.863 --> 24:48.091
how much we try to make their lives miserable,
we never think.

24:48.581 --> 24:51.052
We go on demanding things,

24:52.148 --> 24:56.124
“This is my dharma, what can I do?

24:56.538 --> 24:58.522
This is what I have to do.”

24:58.547 --> 25:01.848
But it becomes such a conditioning of the mind

25:02.253 --> 25:05.735
that I have seen many cases in Sahaja Yoga

25:05.760 --> 25:07.609
who got conditioned like that.

25:07.794 --> 25:12.389
There was a lady, French lady who came to Sahaja Yoga,

25:12.470 --> 25:16.598
and her mother was very ritualistic to begin with,

25:16.828 --> 25:23.057
and she was so troublesome that she must go to church every Sunday.

25:23.349 --> 25:28.452
She would dress up well, go to church and come back home.

25:29.096 --> 25:31.566
And one day she just disappeared.

25:31.718 --> 25:34.762
So they told the police to find out this lady,

25:35.183 --> 25:38.694
and when he went to find out the lady,
the police said that

25:38.719 --> 25:42.062
"We can’t find her, God knows where she has disappeared."

25:42.291 --> 25:45.652
Then she said, "All right, go and find out in the church."

25:45.720 --> 25:47.956
She was still sitting in the church.

25:48.087 --> 25:50.317
Next time again she disappeared.

25:50.381 --> 25:52.131
It happened three, four times.

25:52.156 --> 25:55.155
So the police said, "Sorry, we are finished with her.

25:55.180 --> 26:00.510
Now if you want you can put her in
the old people’s house, and that’s all."

26:00.806 --> 26:03.970
So they sent her to an old people’s house.

26:04.283 --> 26:08.767
So this Sahaja Yogini told Me, "Mother, very surprising,

26:08.886 --> 26:11.640
they are otherwise very stupid people,

26:11.727 --> 26:17.077
they go on sitting, brooding, talking nonsense like mad,

26:17.102 --> 26:22.345
they have all become senile and their senility can be very well seen.

26:22.424 --> 26:28.412
But what happens that on a Sunday
they all dress up well and go to church.

26:29.243 --> 26:32.813
That’s the only point where they are sane."

26:32.838 --> 26:36.213
It is very surprising how the conditioning works.

26:36.238 --> 26:39.039
There was one person I had

26:39.182 --> 26:43.245
who came and stayed with us, and he said, "I’m very good driver."

26:43.370 --> 26:44.853
So I said, "All right."

26:44.878 --> 26:47.562
But he only know driving, he didn’t know about London,

26:47.587 --> 26:49.888
what sort of a place London is.

26:49.954 --> 26:52.678
Now he knew the driving very well,

26:52.703 --> 26:57.229
but if I had to go to the north, he’ll drive Me to the south.

26:57.452 --> 27:01.098
If I had to go to the east, he’ll drive Me to the west.

27:01.123 --> 27:02.699
I said, "What’s the matter?

27:02.699 --> 27:06.456
You know driving?"
"Yes, I know driving, that I know,

27:06.535 --> 27:10.330
but I don’t know anything about road, I have no road sense."

27:10.496 --> 27:12.324
One day the police got hold of him.

27:12.349 --> 27:13.824
I was also in the car.

27:13.849 --> 27:15.904
He said, "Where are you going?"

27:16.253 --> 27:19.347
He said, "I am going to such and such place."

27:19.372 --> 27:23.231
So he said, "Now you have been to this place six times.

27:23.256 --> 27:27.015
Again you are coming back to the same point six times!"

27:27.040 --> 27:31.417
So in the old age I have known that these things form

27:31.474 --> 27:33.560
a kind of a habit,

27:33.645 --> 27:37.390
but in young age also you can find people

27:37.486 --> 27:40.541
get so conditioned by their style.

27:40.632 --> 27:45.997
So this is what you can call the human element,

27:46.022 --> 27:51.332
where you get attached or get bothered about something.

27:52.380 --> 27:58.064
Now it’s a kind of a, I should say, a madness

27:58.303 --> 28:01.572
that somebody demands this, somebody demands that,

28:01.604 --> 28:04.680
"I don’t like this, I don’t like that."

28:04.680 --> 28:07.225
It goes on, and on, and on.

28:07.391 --> 28:12.452
It’s so common to say "I don’t like,” “I like."

28:12.823 --> 28:17.162
It is very surprising that they go on saying like this.

28:17.187 --> 28:21.348
They go to somebody’s house, "No, no, I don’t like this carpet."

28:21.373 --> 28:25.196
I mean, it’s not your carpet, you’ve not purchased it.

28:25.221 --> 28:27.116
This person has purchased the carpet.

28:27.141 --> 28:29.054
What have you got to do?

28:29.079 --> 28:30.757
Why should you say "I don’t like"?

28:30.782 --> 28:31.885
Who are you?

28:31.910 --> 28:33.371
You have not paid for you.

28:33.396 --> 28:36.524
The one who has paid likes it, finished!

28:36.643 --> 28:39.852
Why do you want to pass your remarks, "I don’t like it"?

28:39.877 --> 28:43.143
Are you a connoisseur, so to criticize others?

28:43.379 --> 28:47.221
Somebody is wearing, supposing, the hairdress in a way,

28:47.372 --> 28:50.462
but "I don’t like this kind of hairdress."

28:50.542 --> 28:51.728
"Why?"

28:51.753 --> 28:55.631
"I don’t like, that’s all."

29:02.204 --> 29:05.738
Then it goes from there to human beings and everyone.

29:05.913 --> 29:09.987
Who are you to like or dislike?

29:10.249 --> 29:12.193
What is your position?

29:12.304 --> 29:17.246
Why should you say “I like” or “don’t like”?

29:18.208 --> 29:21.274
But is very common, specially in the West,

29:21.465 --> 29:25.805
to pass such remarks, "I don’t like it."

29:26.172 --> 29:27.932
"I don’t like India."

29:27.957 --> 29:30.060
"All right, if you don’t like, sit at home.

29:30.085 --> 29:31.798
Why did you come here?"

29:31.847 --> 29:33.973
"I don’t like Turkey."

29:34.281 --> 29:35.568
"Why?"

29:35.740 --> 29:40.757
Because if supposing anybody is wearing a long skirt,

29:40.834 --> 29:45.355
they’ll say, "No, I don’t like it because it is Turkish."

29:45.886 --> 29:48.811
So you should only wear short skirts.

29:49.089 --> 29:52.173
But we don’t like short skirts, supposing.

29:52.198 --> 29:55.401
But one should not say that "I don’t like it,"

29:55.426 --> 30:01.049
because it hurts people, it takes awaythe pride of the person.

30:02.279 --> 30:06.001
Now when you are in Sahaja Yoga

30:06.033 --> 30:10.211
you must know that you are not normal human being,

30:10.236 --> 30:15.618
according to the normal standards, you see, you are above them.

30:16.041 --> 30:20.141
Your likes and dislikes are different from theirs,

30:20.340 --> 30:23.221
and your whole attitude has changed.

30:23.898 --> 30:28.570
You are, sometimes you are just like children, I have seen.

30:29.144 --> 30:33.973
You talk like small little children, very innocently,

30:34.020 --> 30:37.826
and sometimes you talk very profound things.

30:38.207 --> 30:42.410
Now this is unknown to people who are supposed to be normal,

30:42.498 --> 30:46.364
because normal people, you know, they are so bombastic,

30:46.389 --> 30:51.849
all the time they go on saying "I, I, I."

30:52.915 --> 31:01.121
Kabira has said that when a goat is living,

31:01.542 --> 31:05.977
she goes on saying "meh, meh, meh," means "I, I, I."

31:06.554 --> 31:13.289
But when she is dead and her intestines are drawn into

31:13.774 --> 31:21.036
a kind of a wire for, we call dhunak - means

31:21.061 --> 31:25.193
“with which they separate the seeds from the cotton"

31:25.265 --> 31:29.031
- that time, what she says, "tu hi, tu hi, tu hi”:

31:29.056 --> 31:35.403
“you are, you are, you are." You are...

31:36.840 --> 31:43.490
When you say that, immediately
your attention goes away from others,

31:43.658 --> 31:48.212
finding faults with them, finding what’s wrong with them,

31:48.299 --> 31:52.839
using your brains all the time to criticize others,

31:53.207 --> 31:58.425
to make fun of others, sometimes even to talk ill of others.

31:58.451 --> 32:00.682
People enjoy gossips.

32:00.786 --> 32:02.023
Why?

32:02.064 --> 32:04.260
They enjoy gossip

32:04.364 --> 32:09.340
because they don’t know that another person is the same as myself,

32:09.684 --> 32:13.297
and I have no business to gossip about that person.

32:13.322 --> 32:17.360
So this understanding, I should say this loving

32:17.385 --> 32:22.021
wisdom doesn’t exist when you are a normal human being.

32:22.304 --> 32:27.076
At the slightest provocation you can get angry,

32:27.205 --> 32:32.114
start doing all kinds of things just like a bull in the

32:32.456 --> 32:35.146
china shop, you can behave any way.

32:35.297 --> 32:39.120
Suddenly you’ll find them just growing up into that.

32:39.145 --> 32:43.355
The reason for that is, you are not yet a Sahaja Yogi.

32:44.038 --> 32:48.702
But Sahaja Yogi is a person who enjoys all kinds of things.

32:49.536 --> 32:55.239
Say somebody becomes very angry and hot-tempered.

32:55.942 --> 33:03.027
He also sees that what is happening, how he is behaving.

33:03.552 --> 33:09.552
So, actually it is not a dharma
that you get angry with someone, it’s not.

33:09.623 --> 33:14.524
It is something very low to be angry with others,

33:14.530 --> 33:19.803
to be all the time shouting at others,
to be exacting things from others

33:19.828 --> 33:25.127
or to criticize others, thinking you are something great.

33:25.272 --> 33:27.034
And this doesn’t pay.

33:27.906 --> 33:30.789
By the time you come to the end of life you’ll find

33:30.813 --> 33:34.329
you haven’t got one friend, one neighbor.

33:35.553 --> 33:40.441
Another thing is that when you are very egoistical,

33:41.092 --> 33:43.557
you think no end of yourself

33:43.653 --> 33:47.703
and you go on talking, jabbering, talking, jabbering,

33:47.838 --> 33:50.932
and the another person just gets bored stiff;

33:51.169 --> 33:54.476
but still you are talking, talking, talking about yourself,

33:54.526 --> 33:57.164
"I did this, I did this, I went there.

33:57.189 --> 33:59.309
I, I, I…"

34:01.026 --> 34:07.190
It goes to any limit,
and you are not ashamed as to what you are saying.

34:08.458 --> 34:14.706
I have seen people who have taken to all kinds of

34:15.011 --> 34:21.626
funny attitudes towards others,
when they are just normal human beings.

34:22.565 --> 34:28.856
If somebody says something wrong about somebody,
somebody says that

34:28.970 --> 34:33.353
"That person is like this, I know, you see he did this way."

34:33.378 --> 34:37.518
Immediately it goes into their mind, "Yes, it’s so."

34:37.962 --> 34:44.432
Now that makes your mind a sick mind,

34:45.234 --> 34:50.209
we can say vikrudh, where the mind is not normal.

34:50.432 --> 34:54.282
You become sick, and you accept all this sickness

34:54.385 --> 35:01.665
and go on accepting it, accepting it till you are a sick person,

35:02.148 --> 35:06.960
and this sickness is extremely dangerous.

35:07.095 --> 35:10.012
Not for others so much as for yourself,

35:10.147 --> 35:14.401
because nobody can stand such a sick personality.

35:14.828 --> 35:20.718
Now you might say, I’ve seen people who have taken to religion.

35:21.027 --> 35:27.189
Like now I am a religious person, supposing now.

35:29.023 --> 35:32.697
You better be religious, so what?

35:32.722 --> 35:34.975
You can’t do this, you can’t do that,

35:35.047 --> 35:39.588
you cannot sit here, you cannot eat this, this is important:

35:39.613 --> 35:45.024
all try type the discipline others,
instead of disciplining yourself.

35:45.548 --> 35:49.727
Because when you are a normal person you don’t see yourself,

35:50.236 --> 35:54.691
you just see others; but once you are a realized soul,

35:54.722 --> 36:00.453
you just start watching yourself and see for yourself what’s wrong.

36:01.372 --> 36:08.136
Now after becoming the Spirit,
in the light of the Spirit you see yourself.

36:09.144 --> 36:11.040
You just see yourself.

36:11.758 --> 36:15.108
What happens, how you behave

36:15.233 --> 36:21.402
and how you enjoy yourself, when you know how to correct yourself.

36:21.664 --> 36:23.544
It’s very sweet.

36:23.894 --> 36:28.214
Little, little things you do in such a beautiful manner,

36:28.278 --> 36:31.293
and you’ll say such beautiful things.

36:31.325 --> 36:38.135
Of course there are people
who cannot be corrected, they’re incorrigible.

36:38.160 --> 36:43.489
So also you should just see this is incorrigible, you can’t help it.

36:43.600 --> 36:46.479
Like in Sahaja Yoga we have some people

36:46.543 --> 36:50.482
who are all the time trying to help the wrong type of people,

36:50.802 --> 36:55.216
like they have taken a power of attorney in Sahaja Yoga.

36:55.241 --> 36:59.295
So if somebody tries to be funny,

36:59.470 --> 37:02.986
we expect a telephone call from that power of attorney.

37:03.111 --> 37:06.270
After two hours, he tells, “Now,

37:06.295 --> 37:10.700
please tell Mother that such and such person is to be looked after.

37:10.725 --> 37:12.900
This has to be done, that has to be done.”

37:12.900 --> 37:16.104
It’s absolutely a habitual thing with them

37:16.129 --> 37:20.268
to inform Me that “No, You must help, You must do something.”

37:21.211 --> 37:24.163
But now it has become such a common practice,

37:24.210 --> 37:27.941
and we know that he will just now come along

37:27.980 --> 37:31.137
and give us a big lecture on this subject.

37:31.342 --> 37:36.737
So you see, it’s a nature of a human being

37:36.793 --> 37:41.822
which has been going through the different types of

37:42.170 --> 37:49.067
complications in life,  also born with some genes or something

37:49.200 --> 37:55.188
that he is not a very normal person, though we say he’s normal;

37:55.346 --> 38:01.763
because the way he reacts, the reaction that he shows is very absurd.

38:01.874 --> 38:06.348
There’s no need for anybody to telephone to Me, to tell Me

38:06.373 --> 38:13.001
that “You see, this man is such and such, You better look after him.”

38:13.390 --> 38:18.071
Unnecessarily to interfere with others’ affairs

38:18.254 --> 38:21.079
when you have no authority,

38:21.769 --> 38:25.035
when you have nothing to do with that person.

38:25.126 --> 38:29.549
All sorts of, I can tell you, designs are there that

38:29.732 --> 38:33.806
has been made into the minds of human beings,

38:33.925 --> 38:38.414
and these designs all disappear, just disappear.

38:38.541 --> 38:42.148
I don’t know how they get all these designs, from where they get it -

38:42.220 --> 38:46.679
maybe their country, maybe their family, maybe their genes -

38:46.704 --> 38:51.828
whatever you may say, all this disappears, even your genes change.

38:52.194 --> 38:58.830
That is what is Sahaja Yoga,
where you become the Spirit; everything changes.

38:59.125 --> 39:04.066
And what happens to you, that you become

39:04.344 --> 39:09.733
a person who knows what is joy, who enjoys joy,

39:09.758 --> 39:14.295
who enjoys existence, who gives joy to others,

39:14.320 --> 39:19.850
makes others happy, all the time thinks how to make others happy.

39:20.016 --> 39:22.184
Just it happens,

39:22.272 --> 39:25.743
though you are brought up the same way as others are,

39:25.768 --> 39:29.830
though you are being educated the same way,  maybe;

39:30.028 --> 39:37.235
but all that disappears
and you become a wise, beautiful joyous person.

39:39.233 --> 39:43.531
It’s something that you have achieved, of which you may not be aware,

39:43.571 --> 39:48.541
the way you are enjoying in this scout-ground.

39:48.764 --> 39:51.929
No other group could have enjoyed as you have enjoyed.

39:51.984 --> 39:55.877
I can see what you are doing here and how you are enjoying,

39:56.195 --> 39:59.615
how you are enjoying the company of others,
it’s very remarkable;

39:59.916 --> 40:05.233
and that has come because your heart is full of joy

40:05.328 --> 40:07.955
of the Spirit that shines within you.

40:08.405 --> 40:11.387
You can examine yourself and see for yourself

40:11.427 --> 40:14.942
whatever I‘m saying is there or not of course,

40:15.012 --> 40:18.130
There are some people who think no end of themself,

40:18.155 --> 40:21.805
they are staying in a hotel or some lodge, or something.

40:21.940 --> 40:23.478
They are not enjoying.

40:24.026 --> 40:26.635
They still think that they are something great,

40:26.714 --> 40:30.745
so they must stay somewhere like that.

40:30.944 --> 40:33.832
Very surprisingly, specially Indians I have seen,

40:33.857 --> 40:39.676
when they come to Cabella they all want to stay in a hotel.

40:39.802 --> 40:44.152
In their lives they might be having one bathroom in their house,

40:44.310 --> 40:47.680
but when they come to Cabella they want to stay in a hotel

40:47.705 --> 40:51.164
with attached bath,  this, that;

40:52.404 --> 40:55.111
young people, it’s very surprising.

40:55.215 --> 40:59.142
It happens because I think they have never seen a good hotel,

40:59.167 --> 41:02.541
or may be that they have lived in a very bad condition.

41:02.612 --> 41:08.444
But a person who is a Sahaja Yogi
can live anywhere, can sleep anywhere.

41:09.057 --> 41:15.006
Only thing is that his Spirit is there to make him happy,
nothing else.

41:15.243 --> 41:18.288
That is the One that gives you happiness.

41:18.313 --> 41:24.763
All these other ideas that human beings have,
which have created problems after problems.

41:26.601 --> 41:31.510
Now you see, because you belong to a different religion, you are bad.

41:31.778 --> 41:34.500
If you want to know about the Christians,

41:34.556 --> 41:37.567
you’d better go and ask the Jews;

41:37.592 --> 41:41.598
and if you want to know about the Jews, better go and ask the Muslims;

41:41.623 --> 41:45.902
and if you want to know about the Muslims, go and ask the Hindus.

41:46.801 --> 41:50.379
You’ll be amazed how they talk about other people

41:50.466 --> 41:53.726
as if all of them are bad, and they are the best.

41:53.774 --> 41:58.910
So this whole attitude changes completely.

41:59.146 --> 42:04.162
You forget it: who is what, whose religion is what,

42:04.187 --> 42:09.907
from what sort of family they come in,
from what is the background they are coming in.

42:10.019 --> 42:13.211
They become just one with each other.

42:13.396 --> 42:17.666
What they enjoy is the company of all the Sahaja Yogis.

42:18.000 --> 42:21.204
All the Sahaja Yogis are there, that’s all.

42:21.283 --> 42:25.503
So many Sahaja Yogis will be there, and that is the Mecca,

42:25.555 --> 42:30.589
that is the Kumbha Mela, that you can call anything if you like.

42:30.699 --> 42:34.538
The collective joy that you enjoy has come to you

42:34.622 --> 42:38.556
because you have crossed, crossed thatbarrier

42:38.636 --> 42:43.061
which has stopped you from seeing the truth.

42:43.442 --> 42:48.250
The truth is, as I said yesterday, that you are the Spirit,

42:48.275 --> 42:56.666
and once you become the Spirit
you become gunatit, kalatit and dharmatit.

42:56.801 --> 43:03.177
Once you cross these limits, then you become like a drop in the ocean.

43:03.315 --> 43:06.590
If the drop is outside the ocean,

43:06.668 --> 43:10.525
it’s always frightened of the sun because it will dry it up;

43:10.836 --> 43:15.096
he doesn’t know what to do, which way to slip, which way to move.

43:15.121 --> 43:18.671
But once it is one with the ocean, it just moves

43:18.696 --> 43:22.840
and enjoy because he’s not alone, it’s not alone.

43:22.865 --> 43:28.814
It’s moving with the waves of that beautiful ocean of joy.

43:29.084 --> 43:33.233
And that is what you have achieved, of which you are aware;

43:33.258 --> 43:36.085
you know, but you don’t know you have achieved it,

43:36.133 --> 43:38.656
because you are the Spirit.

43:39.606 --> 43:41.974
Now you should be on the watch

43:42.609 --> 43:47.849
about yourself sometimes,
and you’d be amazed to see how you are changed,

43:48.620 --> 43:54.366
how you have become so simple and sensible and wise.

43:54.823 --> 43:58.280
So many problems come in the West because

43:58.305 --> 44:03.093
they are still stupid, I think, very stupid people.

44:03.219 --> 44:08.758
Because even an old man of eighty years

44:08.822 --> 44:14.139
would like to marry a lady who seen 20 years

44:14.670 --> 44:18.620
and he doesn’t understand why he is doing it,

44:19.399 --> 44:22.573
because he doesn’t accept his age,

44:22.640 --> 44:27.530
he doesn’t accept that "I am an old man,
I must behave like an old man."

44:27.954 --> 44:34.792
He wants to marry a girl who can be his granddaughter.

44:35.149 --> 44:37.516
This is more common in the West.

44:37.541 --> 44:39.281
They always think like that.

44:39.306 --> 44:42.985
Any young girl they see, they think they should marry that girl.

44:43.214 --> 44:48.476
They may be just on their way to the grave,

44:48.635 --> 44:52.212
but doesn’t matter, they want to have a wife like that.

44:52.300 --> 44:54.499
This is the problem of the West.

44:54.594 --> 44:56.338
Now how does it come?

44:56.363 --> 45:01.402
Because they don’t understand that we are old,

45:01.744 --> 45:04.117
and to be old is to be proud.

45:04.142 --> 45:06.740
Now when I was five years,

45:06.765 --> 45:11.783
I cannot imagine so many people could have
come to wish Me a happy birthday.

45:12.053 --> 45:15.383
Even when I was fifty years there were not so many people.

45:15.408 --> 45:21.046
Now when I am seventy-five, see
how many people are there to wish Me happy birthday!

45:21.712 --> 45:25.355
When you are old you should be proud of your age,

45:25.538 --> 45:29.382
if you have lived wisely; but if you have been stupid,

45:29.407 --> 45:31.793
then of course nobody can help.

45:32.161 --> 45:37.239
Everybody will laugh at such a person,
but they will do the same thing.

45:37.414 --> 45:42.706
It’s a custom in the West to go on having wives after wives,

45:42.731 --> 45:45.018
divorcing your wife and this, that.

45:45.738 --> 45:48.316
In India it’s the other way round I should say,

45:48.341 --> 45:52.277
they don’t have much respect for the women.

45:52.333 --> 45:57.102
They were supposed to have great respect for women,

45:57.127 --> 46:02.249
supposed to have placed their women at the pedestal of a sati,

46:02.408 --> 46:06.674
and even if the woman may be anything, they don’t respect.

46:06.701 --> 46:10.336
Now this is from where it has come, I don’t know.

46:10.361 --> 46:16.147
Some of them say that it is written by some poet

46:16.957 --> 46:18.625
that a woman should be beaten up.

46:18.650 --> 46:19.920
I mean, who is this poet?

46:19.920 --> 46:23.120
He should be beaten up I think, first of all.

46:23.501 --> 46:29.066
He was born out of a woman, and here he writes like this.

46:29.222 --> 46:34.427
So you see, we like to take up something which is wrong,

46:34.713 --> 46:37.157
which is absolutely absurd.

46:37.292 --> 46:41.670
This comes because you are not wise.

46:41.998 --> 46:47.025
A wise person will take in whatever is the wisdom.

46:47.740 --> 46:51.166
He won’t accept anything nonsensical.

46:51.296 --> 46:55.274
You go on reading the books one after another, one after another.

46:55.433 --> 46:59.510
So many books you read, and where do you land up with that?

46:59.600 --> 47:03.792
You find you are reading books which are no good for you,

47:03.817 --> 47:08.459
useless, but if you are fond of reading, you go on reading.

47:09.808 --> 47:17.673
So the lack of wisdom gives you indiscrimination

47:18.142 --> 47:21.713
and you justify it, all that you justify

47:21.738 --> 47:24.050
and you say, "Now this is very good.

47:24.075 --> 47:26.401
Whatever I am doing is the best.”

47:26.426 --> 47:31.392
It’s not ego, I would say, but stupid human understanding.

47:31.916 --> 47:34.961
"Whatever I am doing is good.

47:34.986 --> 47:37.906
Whatever is my attitude is good.

47:37.931 --> 47:42.841
How dare anybody tell me anything that this is wrong, that is wrong?"

47:42.990 --> 47:46.880
Everybody will laugh at that person, make fun of that person.

47:46.961 --> 47:49.540
Such a person will suffer a lot, everything.

47:49.565 --> 47:54.710
But he will never accept that "I have done something wrong."

47:55.011 --> 47:59.772
So when you go beyond dharmatit you become, go beyond dharma,

47:59.797 --> 48:04.009
then what happens that dharma becomes part and parcel of you.

48:04.635 --> 48:09.185
You don’t do wrong things, you just don’t do it.

48:09.630 --> 48:13.048
It’s not that somebody is telling you or you want to follow it,

48:13.081 --> 48:15.899
or there is compulsion or you are disciplined,

48:15.924 --> 48:19.825
but you just don’t like to do wrong things, to say something

48:19.850 --> 48:24.951
which is not respectful, which is not helpful, which is not loving.

48:25.212 --> 48:29.137
This is the quality of a Sahaja Yogi,

48:29.185 --> 48:31.907
where you become the Spirit.

48:32.132 --> 48:35.294
Becoming the Spirit, you don’t have to tell anybody,

48:35.350 --> 48:39.057
so obvious, so evident and one can see that,

48:39.171 --> 48:43.757
and the more you go deep into yourself, you find that

48:43.844 --> 48:49.441
you are endowed with such greatness within you,

48:49.466 --> 48:54.988
such beautiful feelings, such nice things within you

48:55.013 --> 48:59.436
that you overcome the ego of others.

48:59.595 --> 49:01.315
I must tell you a story.

49:01.340 --> 49:04.878
Once I went to see a saint.

49:05.073 --> 49:06.280
So the Sahaja Yogis said,

49:06.281 --> 49:09.544
"Mother, You never go and see these gurus and this and that,

49:09.600 --> 49:11.935
so why do You go?"
I said, "You come along with Me."

49:11.960 --> 49:13.459
So we had to climb a lot.

49:13.484 --> 49:15.436
I said, "From here you see his vibrations.

49:15.461 --> 49:17.082
First you see his vibrations.”

49:17.589 --> 49:20.227
So lots of vibrations were coming.

49:20.252 --> 49:24.493
So we went up the hill, climbed up.

49:24.808 --> 49:29.541
And this gentleman was supposed to have powers

49:29.629 --> 49:35.712
that he could control the rain, and it started raining,

49:35.823 --> 49:40.969
and raining very heavily,
and I got completely drenched in that rain.

49:41.090 --> 49:44.605
When I went up I saw him sitting on a stone,

49:44.630 --> 49:48.163
just shaking his head with anger or I don’t know what.

49:48.648 --> 49:51.531
So I went into his cave and sat down.

49:52.333 --> 49:57.578
So he came back, he came back and he said to Me,

49:57.603 --> 50:02.628
"Mother, why didn’t You allow me to stop the rain?

50:02.779 --> 50:06.044
Is it to overcome my ego?"

50:06.069 --> 50:10.218
I said, "No, not that, I didn’t want,

50:10.243 --> 50:14.938
I didn’t see your ego anywhere; but the problem is the another.

50:15.104 --> 50:18.631
You are a sanyasi, you are a one who are an ascetic,

50:18.656 --> 50:20.296
you bought a sari for Me.

50:20.425 --> 50:24.899
Now if you bought a sari for Me,
I can’t take from you because you’re a sanyasi.

50:24.924 --> 50:30.381
So I had to get drenched,
so that I will have to borrow sari from you."

50:30.406 --> 50:34.606
And the whole thing melted away.

50:34.829 --> 50:37.729
He became a very different person.

50:37.754 --> 50:42.807
So with wisdom you know how to handle different types of people.

50:42.893 --> 50:49.781
You say things by which you melt their ego.

50:49.946 --> 50:59.395
Their conditionings also are brought into a kind of a new awakening.

51:00.546 --> 51:06.597
They see in you that wisdom, that love, that expression of,

51:06.740 --> 51:09.248
I should say, your Spirit.

51:09.454 --> 51:16.387
And that’s how so many saints,
though they were tortured and troubled by many,

51:16.426 --> 51:21.710
but they were definitely very much respected and loved.

51:22.124 --> 51:30.968
But those saints in those days, I must say,
were definitely very nice and good people,

51:31.076 --> 51:38.286
but one thing was there: they were rather strict
and disciplining with their disciples.

51:38.428 --> 51:43.206
The reason was that they were not realized souls, their disciples,

51:43.262 --> 51:48.805
and these gurus thought that “Unless and until
ou discipline these people,

51:48.916 --> 51:52.389
they’ll never rise, they’ll never become something great,

51:52.445 --> 51:54.575
so they have to be disciplined.”

51:54.600 --> 51:57.762
And those who were seekers of truth accepted

51:57.787 --> 52:01.409
that "All right, whatever you say, we’ll do.

52:01.513 --> 52:04.125
Even if you ask us to fast, we’ll do it.”

52:04.150 --> 52:06.979
They’ll stand on their heads, “All right, stand on our heads.

52:06.979 --> 52:10.304
Do what you say, and we will be willing to do it.

52:10.329 --> 52:12.893
You don’t have to worry on that point."

52:12.918 --> 52:15.905
And that’s how they were very disciplining type.

52:15.930 --> 52:19.410
But in Sahaja Yoga there is no discipline taught.

52:19.694 --> 52:22.985
The reason is, you are realized souls,

52:23.010 --> 52:27.738
your Spirit is there and the Spirit gives you the light.

52:27.857 --> 52:33.687
In that light you see yourself so clearly,
and you can discipline yourself.

52:33.789 --> 52:35.679
I don’t have to tell you.

52:35.704 --> 52:40.267
You know that so many people have given up drugs overnight,

52:40.307 --> 52:43.178
but I never told them, I never even talked about  drugs

52:43.203 --> 52:46.123
or anything, and how did they do it?

52:46.148 --> 52:50.784
Because they had the light, and this is what is you have got today,

52:50.809 --> 52:53.098
is the light of the Spirit.

52:53.162 --> 52:56.436
You become absolutely independent

52:56.571 --> 53:00.444
and absolutely free; complete freedom,

53:00.492 --> 53:02.993
because you have the light.

53:03.104 --> 53:08.774
You cannot do, you cannot do wrong things.

53:09.741 --> 53:14.280
Supposing now there is light,

53:14.820 --> 53:20.336
and there is some sort of a big explosion taking place.

53:20.563 --> 53:23.611
I won’t run towards the explosion, no.

53:23.682 --> 53:28.325
You won’t run either, because you have got the eyes.

53:28.350 --> 53:33.410
So the Spirit and its light is the greatest guiding factor

53:33.736 --> 53:38.283
by which you become, as I said, gunatit,

53:40.389 --> 53:46.550
you become kalatit, and you become dharmatit.

53:47.152 --> 53:49.456
You are not slave of anything.

53:49.481 --> 53:53.226
You are not slave of your watch, you are not slave of time,

53:53.251 --> 53:58.387
you are not slave as to what is your gunas are.

53:58.513 --> 54:03.790
You don’t want to see whether
you are right-sided, left-sided or centered.

54:04.078 --> 54:11.886
You are a Sahaja Yogi, and a Sahaja Yogi is beyond all these things,
so you are gunatit.

54:12.193 --> 54:16.542
You are dharmatit because dharma becomes part and parcel of you.

54:16.597 --> 54:21.248
You don’t have to follow any disciplining of dharma.

54:21.273 --> 54:27.282
I have seen in Sahaja Yoga, in some of the ashrams
they are very strict.

54:27.512 --> 54:28.725
That should not be so.

54:28.750 --> 54:31.057
I have told them never to be strict.

54:31.082 --> 54:35.436
If somebody doesn’t get up at, say, four o’clock, doesn’t matter.

54:35.475 --> 54:37.739
Let him get up at ten o’clock.

54:37.814 --> 54:41.673
After some time he himself will get up at four,

54:41.706 --> 54:44.568
but don’t try to discipline them too much.

54:44.687 --> 54:47.707
Children also you should not discipline too much.

54:47.865 --> 54:52.701
Of course if they are realized souls, they themselves are so good,

54:52.726 --> 54:54.198
they are so beautiful.

54:54.223 --> 54:57.378
But if they are not, try to give them Realization.

54:57.403 --> 55:01.005
Once you realize that those who are not realized

55:01.069 --> 55:05.361
are making all these mistakes, that they are in the darkness,

55:05.386 --> 55:09.097
your attitude towards them will change.

55:09.197 --> 55:13.786
You will just try to be extremely patient

55:14.231 --> 55:18.238
and kind, and affectionate and loving,

55:18.303 --> 55:21.435
because you will know that person is not realized.

55:21.586 --> 55:26.220
He has not got his eyes, he can’t see, he is blind,

55:26.245 --> 55:32.012
he can’t hear, he can’t feel the reality.

55:32.273 --> 55:34.774
So first let him feel the reality.

55:34.799 --> 55:37.912
What is the use of giving him a lecture and disciplining?

55:37.937 --> 55:43.117
Still he’ll go on making mistakes
and troubling himself, or troubling others.

55:43.142 --> 55:45.456
So this is what you have achieved

55:45.481 --> 55:50.481
through your enlightenment, that you are beyond all these things.

55:51.148 --> 55:54.976
And you become a person of a temperament

55:55.048 --> 56:00.912
which is so loving and so joy-giving.

56:01.141 --> 56:06.604
I mean, it’s so many examples I can give in Sahaja Yoga
which has happened,

56:06.673 --> 56:11.483
that I have seen the beauty of their love and affection,

56:11.508 --> 56:15.464
not only towards Me, but only towards others also.

56:15.489 --> 56:21.135
Only if it is only towards Me I can explain it,

56:21.247 --> 56:26.494
but I can’t explain the way they are kind to people,
as I told you yesterday,

56:26.519 --> 56:28.746
that these people went to Israel,

56:28.771 --> 56:32.240
now they went to Egypt, they went to Russia.

56:32.265 --> 56:33.249
Who told them?

56:33.249 --> 56:35.625
I never asked anybody to go anywhere.

56:35.650 --> 56:39.191
On their own they felt they have to go  and do this job,

56:39.216 --> 56:44.750
and they have to help people to get out of their ignorance.

56:46.063 --> 56:50.550
So today, on such a day when you are celebrating

56:50.693 --> 56:55.446
My seventy-fifth Birthday, and so many balloons are there -

57:10.964 --> 57:16.266
they are very remarkably, very picturesque

57:16.291 --> 57:21.953
and have colors of different types, expressing your love for Me.

57:23.297 --> 57:26.189
In everything I see your love.

57:26.310 --> 57:30.641
Whatever you have done here, all your decorations, everything,

57:30.776 --> 57:36.244
I feel My children are so loving.

57:36.626 --> 57:41.702
I have done nothing for you,
I don’t know what makes you feel such gratitude.

57:41.845 --> 57:44.350
I still want to know, what have I done?

57:44.375 --> 57:45.881
I have done nothing!

57:45.906 --> 57:48.951
But the way you want to express your love,

57:49.031 --> 57:53.438
it’s very surprising; except for, I would say,

57:53.463 --> 57:58.123
that you got the light of your Spirit.

57:58.222 --> 58:03.275
In that light, might be you see something different in Me,

58:04.347 --> 58:11.069
but the way you are showing your gratitude is really beyond Me.

58:11.195 --> 58:14.090
As the other day, one of the speakers said that

58:14.115 --> 58:16.845
“You don’t thank your mother, take her for granted.”

58:16.870 --> 58:17.950
It’s a fact.

58:18.123 --> 58:21.913
There’s no need to thank Me, you have to take Me for granted.

58:21.938 --> 58:25.496
But the way you want to thank Me, just like a

58:25.521 --> 58:30.682
small little child would like to thank, you just become like children.

58:30.929 --> 58:33.523
You’re so enthusiastic about it,

58:33.555 --> 58:39.881
and you don’t understand that
normally is not done like this anywhere;

58:39.976 --> 58:45.900
nobody tries to be just like children expressing
their beautiful love.

58:46.342 --> 58:51.494
It’s a very new thing that one can see.

58:51.643 --> 58:57.201
Such peace, such love, such joy all around

58:57.495 --> 59:02.778
in a far-fetched place like this, how could you do that?

59:03.212 --> 59:05.021
How could you manage that?

59:05.346 --> 59:12.587
It’s not easy to understand,
it’s not for human beings to see that.

59:13.275 --> 59:17.057
They just don’t understand how these people are like this,

59:17.097 --> 59:21.436
and why are they living like this so happily?

59:21.887 --> 59:27.337
Now you have comforts in the house,
you are living so well in your houses,

59:27.488 --> 59:30.591
everything is there, but here in this scout-ground

59:30.608 --> 59:33.381
it’s not such a comfortable place to live.

59:33.406 --> 59:36.387
But you can live anywhere, I know, I have seen it.

59:36.412 --> 59:39.545
Wherever you are, as long as there are Sahaja Yogis around,

59:39.593 --> 59:41.680
you don’t care for anything.

59:41.705 --> 59:46.861
And this collective enjoyment of each other,

59:47.012 --> 59:50.384
without any expectation, without any criticism,

59:50.409 --> 59:55.429
without any gossip or any nonsense like that, is so beautiful.

59:55.461 --> 59:59.716
And even when you pull each other’s legs,
you know, I enjoy your jokes

59:59.741 --> 01:00:06.416
and understand that it’s such friendship,
such beautiful friendship.

01:00:06.534 --> 01:00:13.037
Whether you are from India or from England
or from America, or from any other place,

01:00:13.062 --> 01:00:17.217
you find there’s such oneness of understanding,

01:00:17.321 --> 01:00:23.468
oneness of movement,  like one waves rises

01:00:23.493 --> 01:00:27.123
and another wave rises, and another wave rises.

01:00:27.148 --> 01:00:35.306
It’s continuous, eternal, and this is
what one has to achieve for others also.

01:00:35.539 --> 01:00:41.053
For that also, must remember that
you have the light; others don’t have.

01:00:41.099 --> 01:00:46.533
So you have to be very considerate, tolerant and understanding

01:00:46.558 --> 01:00:51.404
about their problem, and just listen to them.

01:00:51.490 --> 01:00:52.817
What is their problem?

01:00:52.842 --> 01:00:57.709
First they’ll tell you that “My business is going down,”

01:00:57.765 --> 01:01:02.868
or they might say that  “My wife is no good,”

01:01:02.947 --> 01:01:07.714
or “My son has no job, he is not working.”

01:01:07.749 --> 01:01:10.250
All kinds of things they might tell you.

01:01:10.275 --> 01:01:14.613
Listen, listen to them, for them it is important, all right.

01:01:14.638 --> 01:01:20.871
After that you will find gradually, you see,
they’ll soothe down

01:01:20.999 --> 01:01:26.318
because you are emitting love,  you are emitting joy,

01:01:26.350 --> 01:01:32.978
you are emitting confidence through your spiritual awakening.

01:01:33.003 --> 01:01:35.657
You have those powers.

01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:40.232
You just stand anywhere and you can create peace in that place,

01:01:40.257 --> 01:01:42.879
you can create happiness in that place.

01:01:42.930 --> 01:01:49.284
So be confident, don’t lose your confidence.

01:01:49.435 --> 01:01:56.527
Also your wisdom to understand others will be very much convincing

01:01:56.552 --> 01:02:01.238
for other people to understand that
“They are something exceptional.

01:02:01.317 --> 01:02:04.553
They don’t get angry, they don’t get into temper,

01:02:04.609 --> 01:02:08.453
they are not mad people,
they are not after some sort of a craze -

01:02:08.478 --> 01:02:12.886
just very, very balanced people."

01:02:13.302 --> 01:02:15.675
And this you don’t have to practice.

01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:16.995
It is there.

01:02:17.034 --> 01:02:20.345
It is within you, and you should be proud of it.

01:02:20.704 --> 01:02:26.044
You should not think that it is something

01:02:26.132 --> 01:02:31.406
that you have to achieve, or to become.

01:02:31.431 --> 01:02:34.154
You have it, within yourself you have it.

01:02:34.179 --> 01:02:39.799
Only thing that you have to see in the light of the Spirit yourself.

01:02:41.187 --> 01:02:46.510
It just is a very simple thing, and that works out.

01:02:46.964 --> 01:02:51.279
It is not easy for others to understand you,

01:02:51.398 --> 01:02:54.470
but it should be very easy to understand them;

01:02:54.495 --> 01:02:57.405
because you were like that before,

01:02:57.430 --> 01:03:04.749
and now they are seeing you and they will become like you.

01:03:05.624 --> 01:03:07.191
It’s very simple.

01:03:07.216 --> 01:03:11.815
You can see this, that I started Sahaja Yoga with one lady.

01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:14.278
And now today, see how many are there.

01:03:14.310 --> 01:03:17.719
Now what have I done, I really don’t know, what have I done?

01:03:17.719 --> 01:03:19.791
I have no idea.

01:03:19.824 --> 01:03:24.296
And what you think, such gratitude and enjoyment and joy!

01:03:25.145 --> 01:03:27.946
So all these things, whatever I have told you,

01:03:28.177 --> 01:03:33.718
you have to be aware of your being,  of your own Self,

01:03:33.766 --> 01:03:38.986
of your Spirit, that you are the Spirit.

01:03:39.222 --> 01:03:44.593
And as you are the Spirit, you are beyond all these things.

01:03:44.775 --> 01:03:51.308
And once that happens, you’ll be amazed what a personality you are.

01:03:51.768 --> 01:06:44.579
(Shri Mataji continues in Hindi)
