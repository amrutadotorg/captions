00:00:00.198 --> 00:00:03.579
Birthday Puja March 21, 1998
Delhi, India

00:08:47.534 --> 00:08:56.078
I was overjoyed to see

00:08:56.159 --> 00:09:04.077
the way you had organized this beautiful welcome.

00:09:07.607 --> 00:09:14.187
I must say that it’s your love which finds

00:09:14.294 --> 00:09:25.012
all kind of expressions of enjoying Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:26.423 --> 00:09:35.232
I really can’t understand how these unique ideas

00:09:35.558 --> 00:09:43.581
come to your heads, and you represent

00:09:43.618 --> 00:09:49.321
the different countries from where you have come.

00:09:50.303 --> 00:09:58.419
I wish you carry these flags back to
your own countries,

00:09:58.649 --> 00:10:03.605
and tell them the message that the time has come

00:10:03.898 --> 00:10:10.422
for our resurrection, that we have to rise.

00:10:10.883 --> 00:10:16.489
We have to rise above this human level

00:10:16.751 --> 00:10:20.314
to a higher level of existence.

00:10:20.481 --> 00:10:26.269
And if that happens, then how it changes your life,

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:34.970
how it makes you happy,
how you lose all your absurd ideas of hatred

00:10:35.217 --> 00:10:48.324
and of harming others, injuring others: all this kind of ideas

00:10:48.601 --> 00:10:56.488
which have worked out to give some sort of
a sadistic pleasure to many people,

00:10:56.559 --> 00:11:05.817
and they have enjoyed the way they want to destroy

00:11:06.294 --> 00:11:10.714
the joy of others, the happiness of others.

00:11:11.657 --> 00:11:18.503
To maintain the happiness, I know, you being Sahaja Yogis,

00:11:18.654 --> 00:11:25.290
you have to bear a lot, tolerate a lot of nonsense.

00:11:25.348 --> 00:11:31.352
You have already done it, and gradually once

00:11:31.471 --> 00:11:37.778
Sahaja Yoga is established in your own countries as something

00:11:38.238 --> 00:11:43.031
that is so beautiful, so very pure,

00:11:43.167 --> 00:11:48.717
so very important that all others in your countries

00:11:48.742 --> 00:11:57.298
also will try to follow that path which you have crossed over.

00:11:57.642 --> 00:12:02.243
Only your lives are the ones which will reflect

00:12:02.313 --> 00:12:08.492
the beauty of your inner being and of Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:10.368 --> 00:12:15.945
I told you yesterday what was missing in the human awareness,

00:12:15.993 --> 00:12:20.279
and that the attention was not on the Spirit.

00:12:21.408 --> 00:12:27.441
But when it is on the Spirit, what happens to you?

00:12:27.623 --> 00:12:35.577
Firstly you become according to Sanskrit words, gunatit:

00:12:36.651 --> 00:12:40.260
you go beyond all the three gunas.

00:12:40.567 --> 00:12:49.619
That means you are no more a person who is tamo guni,

00:12:49.644 --> 00:13:00.801
means the one who has got all kinds of desires of self-indulgence.

00:13:02.183 --> 00:13:07.543
Your attention moves from there to the second style

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:11.919
where you are rajo guni, the right-sidedness:

00:13:11.944 --> 00:13:14.852
they want to do something, want to show something,

00:13:14.892 --> 00:13:19.430
you want to become something, you want to compete with others.

00:13:19.523 --> 00:13:22.398
All this struggle just disappears.

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:25.558
"Atit" means beyond.

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:31.494
Then sattwa guni: that is also where you are seeking,

00:13:31.701 --> 00:13:37.180
where you see that what’s wrong in this kind of extreme behavior,

00:13:37.307 --> 00:13:41.012
and you just hate that kind of life

00:13:41.037 --> 00:13:46.567
and you want to get out of it, and then you start seeking.

00:13:47.132 --> 00:13:49.403
That also is finished.

00:13:49.625 --> 00:13:56.431
All the gunas are finished, so you become gunatit.

00:13:57.073 --> 00:14:03.616
It just happens when your attention goes to your Spirit,

00:14:03.871 --> 00:14:11.104
because now the attention is not on any one of your inherent,

00:14:11.129 --> 00:14:17.317
you can say, or conditioned qualities, or of egoistical qualities.

00:14:18.308 --> 00:14:25.146
So you become a person who is beyond this.

00:14:26.811 --> 00:14:33.028
This is something very remarkable as far as

00:14:33.053 --> 00:14:37.717
for normal life, but for you it is not, it just happens.

00:14:37.837 --> 00:14:40.488
You just enjoy being yourself.

00:14:40.925 --> 00:14:47.057
You’re no more concerned about your own conveniences,
comforts and petty things.

00:14:47.123 --> 00:14:51.725
But what happens is that you just go beyond

00:14:51.828 --> 00:14:55.487
all these three gunas which have been

00:14:55.655 --> 00:15:01.151
dominating you this way or that way.

00:15:04.466 --> 00:15:11.275
So that’s how you cross the limit of human awareness, firstly.

00:15:12.209 --> 00:15:22.236
Then the second one is, you become kalatit: you go beyond time.

00:15:22.575 --> 00:15:26.615
I know today I was late somehow.

00:15:27.021 --> 00:15:29.307
It just works out that way.

00:15:29.332 --> 00:15:31.630
But you didn’t miss the time.

00:15:31.655 --> 00:15:35.410
You were still enjoying.
I could see, sitting in the house,

00:15:35.537 --> 00:15:38.281
that you are all in a very enjoyable mood,

00:15:38.306 --> 00:15:41.319
all of you are enjoying nicely.

00:15:41.344 --> 00:15:45.239
I’m not here, but still you are enjoying.

00:15:45.452 --> 00:15:47.762
This is beyond time.

00:15:47.787 --> 00:15:50.133
You’re not bound by time.

00:15:50.158 --> 00:15:54.107
Whatever is the time is your own, because

00:15:54.274 --> 00:15:56.837
you are standing in the present,

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:02.468
you are not standing here and thinking of the future.

00:16:02.779 --> 00:16:06.127
You didn’t think about what will happen tomorrow

00:16:06.152 --> 00:16:10.104
or how will you catch your plane, or how will you do this.

00:16:10.129 --> 00:16:12.373
Here you were just enjoying,

00:16:12.413 --> 00:16:17.270
enjoying the present, and the present is the reality.

00:16:17.889 --> 00:16:22.199
If you are thinking of the future or of the past,

00:16:22.286 --> 00:16:25.453
then you are not in reality.
I have told many-a-times

00:16:25.667 --> 00:16:28.777
that past is finished and future doesn’t exist.

00:16:28.802 --> 00:16:32.806
So at this moment you are here sitting,

00:16:32.894 --> 00:16:36.775
perhaps may be waiting for Me, may be

00:16:36.838 --> 00:16:41.132
just enjoying every moment of your stay here,

00:16:41.236 --> 00:16:44.434
of your connections with others.

00:16:44.879 --> 00:16:48.458
And this enjoyment cannot be described,

00:16:48.538 --> 00:16:51.616
how you are enjoying this.

00:16:52.537 --> 00:16:55.593
Otherwise people would be seeing the watch,

00:16:55.665 --> 00:16:58.315
wondering, “Why Mother has not come?

00:16:58.349 --> 00:17:00.180
What is the problem?

00:17:00.205 --> 00:17:06.657
Why She is not arrived?” and all kinds of ideas can go round.

00:17:07.022 --> 00:17:10.543
It helps a lot to be kalatit.

00:17:10.804 --> 00:17:15.420
I remember in Nasik I had to work very hard because

00:17:15.445 --> 00:17:18.673
no Sahaja Yogi would come forward to do anything,

00:17:18.698 --> 00:17:22.059
they were so shy and so much worried.

00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:26.832
And it so happened, luckily or unluckily we can say,

00:17:26.952 --> 00:17:29.594
that My car failed on the way and

00:17:29.661 --> 00:17:33.433
I was delayed in going.

00:17:33.669 --> 00:17:41.370
About one hour passed, there was no car coming that way,
there’s no way to go,

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:44.595
and we were stranded on the road.

00:17:44.691 --> 00:17:48.616
Now surprisingly, when I reached the place

00:17:48.647 --> 00:17:54.535
where we were going to have the program,
the Sahaja Yogis took over.

00:17:54.705 --> 00:17:59.723
They took the responsibility, and they were very busy

00:18:00.358 --> 00:18:03.717
giving Realizations to others and working it out.

00:18:03.742 --> 00:18:05.614
Otherwise they would not.

00:18:05.639 --> 00:18:08.999
They could not believe that they have power to give Realization.

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:12.591
I may tell them, but they would not raise their hands.

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:18.987
And just because the time was there
and they thought, “So many people are here,

00:18:19.012 --> 00:18:24.683
Mother is not coming or She may be coming,
so it’s our responsibility.”

00:18:24.837 --> 00:18:28.247
In that way they took the responsibility.

00:18:28.295 --> 00:18:33.705
So when you are beyond the time,
you become responsible for that moment.

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:39.209
It’s such a responsibility which is also collective,

00:18:39.566 --> 00:18:44.458
means you just all of you become responsible.

00:18:46.156 --> 00:18:49.530
It’s very surprising, we are so many here,

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:52.993
there’s no quarrel, no fight, nothing.

00:18:53.144 --> 00:18:57.880
We are very nicely settled down, just beyond

00:18:57.905 --> 00:19:03.110
all kinds of stupid ideas of attacking each other.

00:19:03.269 --> 00:19:10.408
That happens because you are not involved with the time.

00:19:10.559 --> 00:19:13.032
The time cannot bow you down.

00:19:13.172 --> 00:19:17.035
Perhaps if it were not you people, some other people,

00:19:17.146 --> 00:19:20.470
they would have thrown stones on My car,

00:19:20.495 --> 00:19:26.232
thinking,  “So it is so late She comes,
we are here boiling in the heat.”

00:19:26.347 --> 00:19:28.657
They would have resented.

00:19:28.682 --> 00:19:32.081
But not the people who are beyond time.

00:19:32.359 --> 00:19:35.330
They are nicely sitting down, enjoying themselves.

00:19:35.601 --> 00:19:41.051
It doesn’t matter, the time passes on.

00:19:42.542 --> 00:19:48.828
Then you become dharmatit: you become beyond dharma,

00:19:49.693 --> 00:19:56.860
beyond your human nature.

00:19:58.014 --> 00:20:02.276
That means whatever you do is religious,

00:20:04.467 --> 00:20:09.035
whatever is your endeavor is religious.

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:13.797
If, say, you are in a business,

00:20:14.035 --> 00:20:18.058
you would like to do business in a religious manner,

00:20:18.161 --> 00:20:23.068
because you are beyond religion you are not bothered as to

00:20:23.108 --> 00:20:27.520
follow a particular pattern or ritual of any religion,

00:20:27.902 --> 00:20:30.139
but you are beyond it.

00:20:30.274 --> 00:20:39.034
Like people who are, you see, not beyond religion:

00:20:39.502 --> 00:20:44.032
they must get up early in the morning,  they are bound

00:20:44.524 --> 00:20:49.221
by their rituals and they pass through the rituals,

00:20:49.246 --> 00:20:54.069
and if one of the rituals is not done
they are very unhappy and shaken up.

00:20:54.211 --> 00:20:55.731
But not you.

00:20:55.835 --> 00:20:58.955
For you, you are always in dhyan,

00:20:59.019 --> 00:21:03.582
always in meditative mood, and anything goes wrong

00:21:03.783 --> 00:21:06.809
you just jump into that awareness

00:21:06.889 --> 00:21:11.177
where you get the solution, and you are not disturbed,

00:21:11.394 --> 00:21:16.604
not disturbed at all when things go wrong.

00:21:16.794 --> 00:21:22.360
Like ritualistic nature makes you very constricted,

00:21:22.534 --> 00:21:26.740
very docile, sometimes can be aggressive also.

00:21:27.003 --> 00:21:31.246
People with their ritualism trouble others a lot.

00:21:31.472 --> 00:21:36.951
Like one lady who was supposed to be our friend came to My house.

00:21:37.241 --> 00:21:40.374
So she said, "I’m a vegetarian."
I said, "Then?"

00:21:40.453 --> 00:21:46.833
"But I can’t eat the food in which non–veg. food has been cooked."

00:21:47.545 --> 00:21:48.714
"All right.

00:21:48.739 --> 00:21:51.910
So we’ll have to get new utensils."

00:21:51.935 --> 00:21:54.884
So I went and bought new utensils for her.

00:21:54.917 --> 00:21:57.841
So she said that "You have to be careful

00:21:57.921 --> 00:22:02.722
that even the spoon should not be used."

00:22:02.817 --> 00:22:05.879
So I had to go and get for her a spoon.

00:22:05.904 --> 00:22:12.361
Then she said, "Tumblers; because people are taking food here

00:22:12.634 --> 00:22:15.539
who are eating non–veg. food,

00:22:15.641 --> 00:22:21.116
so you better get us something which is absolutely new."

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:24.168
So I had to incur all these problems.

00:22:24.414 --> 00:22:28.078
And then she was in the kitchen and she wouldn’t allow

00:22:28.156 --> 00:22:30.285
our cook to cook anything for us.

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:33.676
She said, "First I will cook, and then you can cook."

00:22:33.779 --> 00:22:36.921
And she made such a nuisance out of her

00:22:36.992 --> 00:22:41.127
that instead of being a guest she became a pest,

00:22:41.647 --> 00:22:45.351
and this is what happens to people who are ritualistic,

00:22:45.398 --> 00:22:47.883
because they are very demanding.

00:22:47.907 --> 00:22:51.633
They go on demanding that “This is our dharma.”

00:22:51.854 --> 00:22:57.697
I know of another story was told to Me by somebody in Bombay.

00:22:57.829 --> 00:23:01.631
She said, "This lady who came to me as a guest, because

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:05.059
she was related to something very high up,

00:23:05.298 --> 00:23:09.731
she was worse than my great-great-great-grandmother."

00:23:09.826 --> 00:23:11.566
I said, "Really?"

00:23:11.591 --> 00:23:15.192
She said, "I can’t understand that in India

00:23:15.247 --> 00:23:17.739
we have such people still living.

00:23:17.771 --> 00:23:22.832
She came here and she said, ‘I cannot take water from the tap.

00:23:23.027 --> 00:23:26.787
You have to get it from some sort of a well.’

00:23:27.083 --> 00:23:30.574
“Now, there are only two wells in Bombay.

00:23:30.622 --> 00:23:34.143
So people had to go and fetch the water,

00:23:34.218 --> 00:23:38.908
but the cook had to be completely drenched in water

00:23:38.933 --> 00:23:41.290
and then only he could cook.

00:23:41.315 --> 00:23:44.724
“‘Because if he cooks without that, then I won’t eat.’

00:23:45.169 --> 00:23:49.235
“And she went on, and on, and on there, and

00:23:49.325 --> 00:23:51.689
the cook got sick with pneumonia,

00:23:51.714 --> 00:23:55.618
another cook came and he got flu, you see?

00:23:55.643 --> 00:23:56.890
This lady didn’t mind.

00:23:56.890 --> 00:23:59.090
“She said, ‘No, that’s my style.’"

00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:03.369
So she asked Me, "What should we do with such people, Mother?"

00:24:03.394 --> 00:24:06.475
I said, "You should have asked her
that ‘We have this thing.

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:09.445
If you like it well and good; otherwise you don’t eat,

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:13.633
it’s all right, good. Fasting is a very good thing.’

00:24:14.427 --> 00:24:19.206
That’s the only solution for such people who are so self-centered

00:24:19.231 --> 00:24:22.714
and so much bothering others.”

00:24:22.762 --> 00:24:25.827
So this self-centeredness comes to us

00:24:25.843 --> 00:24:28.700
because we think, "This is our dharma,

00:24:28.725 --> 00:24:33.330
this is our right, this is - everything belongs to us.

00:24:33.355 --> 00:24:36.235
How dare they do not do it?"

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:40.744
How much we trouble others, how much we make them inconvenient,

00:24:40.863 --> 00:24:48.091
how much we try to make their lives miserable,
we never think.

00:24:48.581 --> 00:24:51.052
We go on demanding things,

00:24:52.148 --> 00:24:56.124
“This is my dharma, what can I do?

00:24:56.538 --> 00:24:58.522
This is what I have to do.”

00:24:58.547 --> 00:25:01.848
But it becomes such a conditioning of the mind

00:25:02.253 --> 00:25:05.735
that I have seen many cases in Sahaja Yoga

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:07.609
who got conditioned like that.

00:25:07.794 --> 00:25:12.389
There was a lady, French lady who came to Sahaja Yoga,

00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:16.598
and her mother was very ritualistic to begin with,

00:25:16.828 --> 00:25:23.057
and she was so troublesome that she must go to church every Sunday.

00:25:23.349 --> 00:25:28.452
She would dress up well, go to church and come back home.

00:25:29.096 --> 00:25:31.566
And one day she just disappeared.

00:25:31.718 --> 00:25:34.762
So they told the police to find out this lady,

00:25:35.183 --> 00:25:38.694
and when he went to find out the lady,
the police said that

00:25:38.719 --> 00:25:42.062
"We can’t find her, God knows where she has disappeared."

00:25:42.291 --> 00:25:45.652
Then she said, "All right, go and find out in the church."

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:47.956
She was still sitting in the church.

00:25:48.087 --> 00:25:50.317
Next time again she disappeared.

00:25:50.381 --> 00:25:52.131
It happened three, four times.

00:25:52.156 --> 00:25:55.155
So the police said, "Sorry, we are finished with her.

00:25:55.180 --> 00:26:00.510
Now if you want you can put her in
the old people’s house, and that’s all."

00:26:00.806 --> 00:26:03.970
So they sent her to an old people’s house.

00:26:04.283 --> 00:26:08.767
So this Sahaja Yogini told Me, "Mother, very surprising,

00:26:08.886 --> 00:26:11.640
they are otherwise very stupid people,

00:26:11.727 --> 00:26:17.077
they go on sitting, brooding, talking nonsense like mad,

00:26:17.102 --> 00:26:22.345
they have all become senile and their senility can be very well seen.

00:26:22.424 --> 00:26:28.412
But what happens that on a Sunday
they all dress up well and go to church.

00:26:29.243 --> 00:26:32.813
That’s the only point where they are sane."

00:26:32.838 --> 00:26:36.213
It is very surprising how the conditioning works.

00:26:36.238 --> 00:26:39.039
There was one person I had

00:26:39.182 --> 00:26:43.245
who came and stayed with us, and he said, "I’m very good driver."

00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:44.853
So I said, "All right."

00:26:44.878 --> 00:26:47.562
But he only know driving, he didn’t know about London,

00:26:47.587 --> 00:26:49.888
what sort of a place London is.

00:26:49.954 --> 00:26:52.678
Now he knew the driving very well,

00:26:52.703 --> 00:26:57.229
but if I had to go to the north, he’ll drive Me to the south.

00:26:57.452 --> 00:27:01.098
If I had to go to the east, he’ll drive Me to the west.

00:27:01.123 --> 00:27:02.699
I said, "What’s the matter?

00:27:02.699 --> 00:27:06.456
You know driving?"
"Yes, I know driving, that I know,

00:27:06.535 --> 00:27:10.330
but I don’t know anything about road, I have no road sense."

00:27:10.496 --> 00:27:12.324
One day the police got hold of him.

00:27:12.349 --> 00:27:13.824
I was also in the car.

00:27:13.849 --> 00:27:15.904
He said, "Where are you going?"

00:27:16.253 --> 00:27:19.347
He said, "I am going to such and such place."

00:27:19.372 --> 00:27:23.231
So he said, "Now you have been to this place six times.

00:27:23.256 --> 00:27:27.015
Again you are coming back to the same point six times!"

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:31.417
So in the old age I have known that these things form

00:27:31.474 --> 00:27:33.560
a kind of a habit,

00:27:33.645 --> 00:27:37.390
but in young age also you can find people

00:27:37.486 --> 00:27:40.541
get so conditioned by their style.

00:27:40.632 --> 00:27:45.997
So this is what you can call the human element,

00:27:46.022 --> 00:27:51.332
where you get attached or get bothered about something.

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:58.064
Now it’s a kind of a, I should say, a madness

00:27:58.303 --> 00:28:01.572
that somebody demands this, somebody demands that,

00:28:01.604 --> 00:28:04.680
"I don’t like this, I don’t like that."

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:07.225
It goes on, and on, and on.

00:28:07.391 --> 00:28:12.452
It’s so common to say "I don’t like,” “I like."

00:28:12.823 --> 00:28:17.162
It is very surprising that they go on saying like this.

00:28:17.187 --> 00:28:21.348
They go to somebody’s house, "No, no, I don’t like this carpet."

00:28:21.373 --> 00:28:25.196
I mean, it’s not your carpet, you’ve not purchased it.

00:28:25.221 --> 00:28:27.116
This person has purchased the carpet.

00:28:27.141 --> 00:28:29.054
What have you got to do?

00:28:29.079 --> 00:28:30.757
Why should you say "I don’t like"?

00:28:30.782 --> 00:28:31.885
Who are you?

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:33.371
You have not paid for you.

00:28:33.396 --> 00:28:36.524
The one who has paid likes it, finished!

00:28:36.643 --> 00:28:39.852
Why do you want to pass your remarks, "I don’t like it"?

00:28:39.877 --> 00:28:43.143
Are you a connoisseur, so to criticize others?

00:28:43.379 --> 00:28:47.221
Somebody is wearing, supposing, the hairdress in a way,

00:28:47.372 --> 00:28:50.462
but "I don’t like this kind of hairdress."

00:28:50.542 --> 00:28:51.728
"Why?"

00:28:51.753 --> 00:28:55.631
"I don’t like, that’s all."

00:29:02.204 --> 00:29:05.738
Then it goes from there to human beings and everyone.

00:29:05.913 --> 00:29:09.987
Who are you to like or dislike?

00:29:10.249 --> 00:29:12.193
What is your position?

00:29:12.304 --> 00:29:17.246
Why should you say “I like” or “don’t like”?

00:29:18.208 --> 00:29:21.274
But is very common, specially in the West,

00:29:21.465 --> 00:29:25.805
to pass such remarks, "I don’t like it."

00:29:26.172 --> 00:29:27.932
"I don’t like India."

00:29:27.957 --> 00:29:30.060
"All right, if you don’t like, sit at home.

00:29:30.085 --> 00:29:31.798
Why did you come here?"

00:29:31.847 --> 00:29:33.973
"I don’t like Turkey."

00:29:34.281 --> 00:29:35.568
"Why?"

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:40.757
Because if supposing anybody is wearing a long skirt,

00:29:40.834 --> 00:29:45.355
they’ll say, "No, I don’t like it because it is Turkish."

00:29:45.886 --> 00:29:48.811
So you should only wear short skirts.

00:29:49.089 --> 00:29:52.173
But we don’t like short skirts, supposing.

00:29:52.198 --> 00:29:55.401
But one should not say that "I don’t like it,"

00:29:55.426 --> 00:30:01.049
because it hurts people, it takes awaythe pride of the person.

00:30:02.279 --> 00:30:06.001
Now when you are in Sahaja Yoga

00:30:06.033 --> 00:30:10.211
you must know that you are not normal human being,

00:30:10.236 --> 00:30:15.618
according to the normal standards, you see, you are above them.

00:30:16.041 --> 00:30:20.141
Your likes and dislikes are different from theirs,

00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:23.221
and your whole attitude has changed.

00:30:23.898 --> 00:30:28.570
You are, sometimes you are just like children, I have seen.

00:30:29.144 --> 00:30:33.973
You talk like small little children, very innocently,

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:37.826
and sometimes you talk very profound things.

00:30:38.207 --> 00:30:42.410
Now this is unknown to people who are supposed to be normal,

00:30:42.498 --> 00:30:46.364
because normal people, you know, they are so bombastic,

00:30:46.389 --> 00:30:51.849
all the time they go on saying "I, I, I."

00:30:52.915 --> 00:31:01.121
Kabira has said that when a goat is living,

00:31:01.542 --> 00:31:05.977
she goes on saying "meh, meh, meh," means "I, I, I."

00:31:06.554 --> 00:31:13.289
But when she is dead and her intestines are drawn into

00:31:13.774 --> 00:31:21.036
a kind of a wire for, we call dhunak - means

00:31:21.061 --> 00:31:25.193
“with which they separate the seeds from the cotton"

00:31:25.265 --> 00:31:29.031
- that time, what she says, "tu hi, tu hi, tu hi”:

00:31:29.056 --> 00:31:35.403
“you are, you are, you are." You are...

00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:43.490
When you say that, immediately
your attention goes away from others,

00:31:43.658 --> 00:31:48.212
finding faults with them, finding what’s wrong with them,

00:31:48.299 --> 00:31:52.839
using your brains all the time to criticize others,

00:31:53.207 --> 00:31:58.425
to make fun of others, sometimes even to talk ill of others.

00:31:58.451 --> 00:32:00.682
People enjoy gossips.

00:32:00.786 --> 00:32:02.023
Why?

00:32:02.064 --> 00:32:04.260
They enjoy gossip

00:32:04.364 --> 00:32:09.340
because they don’t know that another person is the same as myself,

00:32:09.684 --> 00:32:13.297
and I have no business to gossip about that person.

00:32:13.322 --> 00:32:17.360
So this understanding, I should say this loving

00:32:17.385 --> 00:32:22.021
wisdom doesn’t exist when you are a normal human being.

00:32:22.304 --> 00:32:27.076
At the slightest provocation you can get angry,

00:32:27.205 --> 00:32:32.114
start doing all kinds of things just like a bull in the

00:32:32.456 --> 00:32:35.146
china shop, you can behave any way.

00:32:35.297 --> 00:32:39.120
Suddenly you’ll find them just growing up into that.

00:32:39.145 --> 00:32:43.355
The reason for that is, you are not yet a Sahaja Yogi.

00:32:44.038 --> 00:32:48.702
But Sahaja Yogi is a person who enjoys all kinds of things.

00:32:49.536 --> 00:32:55.239
Say somebody becomes very angry and hot-tempered.

00:32:55.942 --> 00:33:03.027
He also sees that what is happening, how he is behaving.

00:33:03.552 --> 00:33:09.552
So, actually it is not a dharma
that you get angry with someone, it’s not.

00:33:09.623 --> 00:33:14.524
It is something very low to be angry with others,

00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:19.803
to be all the time shouting at others,
to be exacting things from others

00:33:19.828 --> 00:33:25.127
or to criticize others, thinking you are something great.

00:33:25.272 --> 00:33:27.034
And this doesn’t pay.

00:33:27.906 --> 00:33:30.789
By the time you come to the end of life you’ll find

00:33:30.813 --> 00:33:34.329
you haven’t got one friend, one neighbor.

00:33:35.553 --> 00:33:40.441
Another thing is that when you are very egoistical,

00:33:41.092 --> 00:33:43.557
you think no end of yourself

00:33:43.653 --> 00:33:47.703
and you go on talking, jabbering, talking, jabbering,

00:33:47.838 --> 00:33:50.932
and the another person just gets bored stiff;

00:33:51.169 --> 00:33:54.476
but still you are talking, talking, talking about yourself,

00:33:54.526 --> 00:33:57.164
"I did this, I did this, I went there.

00:33:57.189 --> 00:33:59.309
I, I, I…"

00:34:01.026 --> 00:34:07.190
It goes to any limit,
and you are not ashamed as to what you are saying.

00:34:08.458 --> 00:34:14.706
I have seen people who have taken to all kinds of

00:34:15.011 --> 00:34:21.626
funny attitudes towards others,
when they are just normal human beings.

00:34:22.565 --> 00:34:28.856
If somebody says something wrong about somebody,
somebody says that

00:34:28.970 --> 00:34:33.353
"That person is like this, I know, you see he did this way."

00:34:33.378 --> 00:34:37.518
Immediately it goes into their mind, "Yes, it’s so."

00:34:37.962 --> 00:34:44.432
Now that makes your mind a sick mind,

00:34:45.234 --> 00:34:50.209
we can say vikrudh, where the mind is not normal.

00:34:50.432 --> 00:34:54.282
You become sick, and you accept all this sickness

00:34:54.385 --> 00:35:01.665
and go on accepting it, accepting it till you are a sick person,

00:35:02.148 --> 00:35:06.960
and this sickness is extremely dangerous.

00:35:07.095 --> 00:35:10.012
Not for others so much as for yourself,

00:35:10.147 --> 00:35:14.401
because nobody can stand such a sick personality.

00:35:14.828 --> 00:35:20.718
Now you might say, I’ve seen people who have taken to religion.

00:35:21.027 --> 00:35:27.189
Like now I am a religious person, supposing now.

00:35:29.023 --> 00:35:32.697
You better be religious, so what?

00:35:32.722 --> 00:35:34.975
You can’t do this, you can’t do that,

00:35:35.047 --> 00:35:39.588
you cannot sit here, you cannot eat this, this is important:

00:35:39.613 --> 00:35:45.024
all try type the discipline others,
instead of disciplining yourself.

00:35:45.548 --> 00:35:49.727
Because when you are a normal person you don’t see yourself,

00:35:50.236 --> 00:35:54.691
you just see others; but once you are a realized soul,

00:35:54.722 --> 00:36:00.453
you just start watching yourself and see for yourself what’s wrong.

00:36:01.372 --> 00:36:08.136
Now after becoming the Spirit,
in the light of the Spirit you see yourself.

00:36:09.144 --> 00:36:11.040
You just see yourself.

00:36:11.758 --> 00:36:15.108
What happens, how you behave

00:36:15.233 --> 00:36:21.402
and how you enjoy yourself, when you know how to correct yourself.

00:36:21.664 --> 00:36:23.544
It’s very sweet.

00:36:23.894 --> 00:36:28.214
Little, little things you do in such a beautiful manner,

00:36:28.278 --> 00:36:31.293
and you’ll say such beautiful things.

00:36:31.325 --> 00:36:38.135
Of course there are people
who cannot be corrected, they’re incorrigible.

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:43.489
So also you should just see this is incorrigible, you can’t help it.

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:46.479
Like in Sahaja Yoga we have some people

00:36:46.543 --> 00:36:50.482
who are all the time trying to help the wrong type of people,

00:36:50.802 --> 00:36:55.216
like they have taken a power of attorney in Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:55.241 --> 00:36:59.295
So if somebody tries to be funny,

00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:02.986
we expect a telephone call from that power of attorney.

00:37:03.111 --> 00:37:06.270
After two hours, he tells, “Now,

00:37:06.295 --> 00:37:10.700
please tell Mother that such and such person is to be looked after.

00:37:10.725 --> 00:37:12.900
This has to be done, that has to be done.”

00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:16.104
It’s absolutely a habitual thing with them

00:37:16.129 --> 00:37:20.268
to inform Me that “No, You must help, You must do something.”

00:37:21.211 --> 00:37:24.163
But now it has become such a common practice,

00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:27.941
and we know that he will just now come along

00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:31.137
and give us a big lecture on this subject.

00:37:31.342 --> 00:37:36.737
So you see, it’s a nature of a human being

00:37:36.793 --> 00:37:41.822
which has been going through the different types of

00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:49.067
complications in life,  also born with some genes or something

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:55.188
that he is not a very normal person, though we say he’s normal;

00:37:55.346 --> 00:38:01.763
because the way he reacts, the reaction that he shows is very absurd.

00:38:01.874 --> 00:38:06.348
There’s no need for anybody to telephone to Me, to tell Me

00:38:06.373 --> 00:38:13.001
that “You see, this man is such and such, You better look after him.”

00:38:13.390 --> 00:38:18.071
Unnecessarily to interfere with others’ affairs

00:38:18.254 --> 00:38:21.079
when you have no authority,

00:38:21.769 --> 00:38:25.035
when you have nothing to do with that person.

00:38:25.126 --> 00:38:29.549
All sorts of, I can tell you, designs are there that

00:38:29.732 --> 00:38:33.806
has been made into the minds of human beings,

00:38:33.925 --> 00:38:38.414
and these designs all disappear, just disappear.

00:38:38.541 --> 00:38:42.148
I don’t know how they get all these designs, from where they get it -

00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:46.679
maybe their country, maybe their family, maybe their genes -

00:38:46.704 --> 00:38:51.828
whatever you may say, all this disappears, even your genes change.

00:38:52.194 --> 00:38:58.830
That is what is Sahaja Yoga,
where you become the Spirit; everything changes.

00:38:59.125 --> 00:39:04.066
And what happens to you, that you become

00:39:04.344 --> 00:39:09.733
a person who knows what is joy, who enjoys joy,

00:39:09.758 --> 00:39:14.295
who enjoys existence, who gives joy to others,

00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:19.850
makes others happy, all the time thinks how to make others happy.

00:39:20.016 --> 00:39:22.184
Just it happens,

00:39:22.272 --> 00:39:25.743
though you are brought up the same way as others are,

00:39:25.768 --> 00:39:29.830
though you are being educated the same way,  maybe;

00:39:30.028 --> 00:39:37.235
but all that disappears
and you become a wise, beautiful joyous person.

00:39:39.233 --> 00:39:43.531
It’s something that you have achieved, of which you may not be aware,

00:39:43.571 --> 00:39:48.541
the way you are enjoying in this scout-ground.

00:39:48.764 --> 00:39:51.929
No other group could have enjoyed as you have enjoyed.

00:39:51.984 --> 00:39:55.877
I can see what you are doing here and how you are enjoying,

00:39:56.195 --> 00:39:59.615
how you are enjoying the company of others,
it’s very remarkable;

00:39:59.916 --> 00:40:05.233
and that has come because your heart is full of joy

00:40:05.328 --> 00:40:07.955
of the Spirit that shines within you.

00:40:08.405 --> 00:40:11.387
You can examine yourself and see for yourself

00:40:11.427 --> 00:40:14.942
whatever I‘m saying is there or not of course,

00:40:15.012 --> 00:40:18.130
There are some people who think no end of themself,

00:40:18.155 --> 00:40:21.805
they are staying in a hotel or some lodge, or something.

00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:23.478
They are not enjoying.

00:40:24.026 --> 00:40:26.635
They still think that they are something great,

00:40:26.714 --> 00:40:30.745
so they must stay somewhere like that.

00:40:30.944 --> 00:40:33.832
Very surprisingly, specially Indians I have seen,

00:40:33.857 --> 00:40:39.676
when they come to Cabella they all want to stay in a hotel.

00:40:39.802 --> 00:40:44.152
In their lives they might be having one bathroom in their house,

00:40:44.310 --> 00:40:47.680
but when they come to Cabella they want to stay in a hotel

00:40:47.705 --> 00:40:51.164
with attached bath,  this, that;

00:40:52.404 --> 00:40:55.111
young people, it’s very surprising.

00:40:55.215 --> 00:40:59.142
It happens because I think they have never seen a good hotel,

00:40:59.167 --> 00:41:02.541
or may be that they have lived in a very bad condition.

00:41:02.612 --> 00:41:08.444
But a person who is a Sahaja Yogi
can live anywhere, can sleep anywhere.

00:41:09.057 --> 00:41:15.006
Only thing is that his Spirit is there to make him happy,
nothing else.

00:41:15.243 --> 00:41:18.288
That is the One that gives you happiness.

00:41:18.313 --> 00:41:24.763
All these other ideas that human beings have,
which have created problems after problems.

00:41:26.601 --> 00:41:31.510
Now you see, because you belong to a different religion, you are bad.

00:41:31.778 --> 00:41:34.500
If you want to know about the Christians,

00:41:34.556 --> 00:41:37.567
you’d better go and ask the Jews;

00:41:37.592 --> 00:41:41.598
and if you want to know about the Jews, better go and ask the Muslims;

00:41:41.623 --> 00:41:45.902
and if you want to know about the Muslims, go and ask the Hindus.

00:41:46.801 --> 00:41:50.379
You’ll be amazed how they talk about other people

00:41:50.466 --> 00:41:53.726
as if all of them are bad, and they are the best.

00:41:53.774 --> 00:41:58.910
So this whole attitude changes completely.

00:41:59.146 --> 00:42:04.162
You forget it: who is what, whose religion is what,

00:42:04.187 --> 00:42:09.907
from what sort of family they come in,
from what is the background they are coming in.

00:42:10.019 --> 00:42:13.211
They become just one with each other.

00:42:13.396 --> 00:42:17.666
What they enjoy is the company of all the Sahaja Yogis.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.204
All the Sahaja Yogis are there, that’s all.

00:42:21.283 --> 00:42:25.503
So many Sahaja Yogis will be there, and that is the Mecca,

00:42:25.555 --> 00:42:30.589
that is the Kumbha Mela, that you can call anything if you like.

00:42:30.699 --> 00:42:34.538
The collective joy that you enjoy has come to you

00:42:34.622 --> 00:42:38.556
because you have crossed, crossed thatbarrier

00:42:38.636 --> 00:42:43.061
which has stopped you from seeing the truth.

00:42:43.442 --> 00:42:48.250
The truth is, as I said yesterday, that you are the Spirit,

00:42:48.275 --> 00:42:56.666
and once you become the Spirit
you become gunatit, kalatit and dharmatit.

00:42:56.801 --> 00:43:03.177
Once you cross these limits, then you become like a drop in the ocean.

00:43:03.315 --> 00:43:06.590
If the drop is outside the ocean,

00:43:06.668 --> 00:43:10.525
it’s always frightened of the sun because it will dry it up;

00:43:10.836 --> 00:43:15.096
he doesn’t know what to do, which way to slip, which way to move.

00:43:15.121 --> 00:43:18.671
But once it is one with the ocean, it just moves

00:43:18.696 --> 00:43:22.840
and enjoy because he’s not alone, it’s not alone.

00:43:22.865 --> 00:43:28.814
It’s moving with the waves of that beautiful ocean of joy.

00:43:29.084 --> 00:43:33.233
And that is what you have achieved, of which you are aware;

00:43:33.258 --> 00:43:36.085
you know, but you don’t know you have achieved it,

00:43:36.133 --> 00:43:38.656
because you are the Spirit.

00:43:39.606 --> 00:43:41.974
Now you should be on the watch

00:43:42.609 --> 00:43:47.849
about yourself sometimes,
and you’d be amazed to see how you are changed,

00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:54.366
how you have become so simple and sensible and wise.

00:43:54.823 --> 00:43:58.280
So many problems come in the West because

00:43:58.305 --> 00:44:03.093
they are still stupid, I think, very stupid people.

00:44:03.219 --> 00:44:08.758
Because even an old man of eighty years

00:44:08.822 --> 00:44:14.139
would like to marry a lady who seen 20 years

00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:18.620
and he doesn’t understand why he is doing it,

00:44:19.399 --> 00:44:22.573
because he doesn’t accept his age,

00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:27.530
he doesn’t accept that "I am an old man,
I must behave like an old man."

00:44:27.954 --> 00:44:34.792
He wants to marry a girl who can be his granddaughter.

00:44:35.149 --> 00:44:37.516
This is more common in the West.

00:44:37.541 --> 00:44:39.281
They always think like that.

00:44:39.306 --> 00:44:42.985
Any young girl they see, they think they should marry that girl.

00:44:43.214 --> 00:44:48.476
They may be just on their way to the grave,

00:44:48.635 --> 00:44:52.212
but doesn’t matter, they want to have a wife like that.

00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:54.499
This is the problem of the West.

00:44:54.594 --> 00:44:56.338
Now how does it come?

00:44:56.363 --> 00:45:01.402
Because they don’t understand that we are old,

00:45:01.744 --> 00:45:04.117
and to be old is to be proud.

00:45:04.142 --> 00:45:06.740
Now when I was five years,

00:45:06.765 --> 00:45:11.783
I cannot imagine so many people could have
come to wish Me a happy birthday.

00:45:12.053 --> 00:45:15.383
Even when I was fifty years there were not so many people.

00:45:15.408 --> 00:45:21.046
Now when I am seventy-five, see
how many people are there to wish Me happy birthday!

00:45:21.712 --> 00:45:25.355
When you are old you should be proud of your age,

00:45:25.538 --> 00:45:29.382
if you have lived wisely; but if you have been stupid,

00:45:29.407 --> 00:45:31.793
then of course nobody can help.

00:45:32.161 --> 00:45:37.239
Everybody will laugh at such a person,
but they will do the same thing.

00:45:37.414 --> 00:45:42.706
It’s a custom in the West to go on having wives after wives,

00:45:42.731 --> 00:45:45.018
divorcing your wife and this, that.

00:45:45.738 --> 00:45:48.316
In India it’s the other way round I should say,

00:45:48.341 --> 00:45:52.277
they don’t have much respect for the women.

00:45:52.333 --> 00:45:57.102
They were supposed to have great respect for women,

00:45:57.127 --> 00:46:02.249
supposed to have placed their women at the pedestal of a sati,

00:46:02.408 --> 00:46:06.674
and even if the woman may be anything, they don’t respect.

00:46:06.701 --> 00:46:10.336
Now this is from where it has come, I don’t know.

00:46:10.361 --> 00:46:16.147
Some of them say that it is written by some poet

00:46:16.957 --> 00:46:18.625
that a woman should be beaten up.

00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:19.920
I mean, who is this poet?

00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:23.120
He should be beaten up I think, first of all.

00:46:23.501 --> 00:46:29.066
He was born out of a woman, and here he writes like this.

00:46:29.222 --> 00:46:34.427
So you see, we like to take up something which is wrong,

00:46:34.713 --> 00:46:37.157
which is absolutely absurd.

00:46:37.292 --> 00:46:41.670
This comes because you are not wise.

00:46:41.998 --> 00:46:47.025
A wise person will take in whatever is the wisdom.

00:46:47.740 --> 00:46:51.166
He won’t accept anything nonsensical.

00:46:51.296 --> 00:46:55.274
You go on reading the books one after another, one after another.

00:46:55.433 --> 00:46:59.510
So many books you read, and where do you land up with that?

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:03.792
You find you are reading books which are no good for you,

00:47:03.817 --> 00:47:08.459
useless, but if you are fond of reading, you go on reading.

00:47:09.808 --> 00:47:17.673
So the lack of wisdom gives you indiscrimination

00:47:18.142 --> 00:47:21.713
and you justify it, all that you justify

00:47:21.738 --> 00:47:24.050
and you say, "Now this is very good.

00:47:24.075 --> 00:47:26.401
Whatever I am doing is the best.”

00:47:26.426 --> 00:47:31.392
It’s not ego, I would say, but stupid human understanding.

00:47:31.916 --> 00:47:34.961
"Whatever I am doing is good.

00:47:34.986 --> 00:47:37.906
Whatever is my attitude is good.

00:47:37.931 --> 00:47:42.841
How dare anybody tell me anything that this is wrong, that is wrong?"

00:47:42.990 --> 00:47:46.880
Everybody will laugh at that person, make fun of that person.

00:47:46.961 --> 00:47:49.540
Such a person will suffer a lot, everything.

00:47:49.565 --> 00:47:54.710
But he will never accept that "I have done something wrong."

00:47:55.011 --> 00:47:59.772
So when you go beyond dharmatit you become, go beyond dharma,

00:47:59.797 --> 00:48:04.009
then what happens that dharma becomes part and parcel of you.

00:48:04.635 --> 00:48:09.185
You don’t do wrong things, you just don’t do it.

00:48:09.630 --> 00:48:13.048
It’s not that somebody is telling you or you want to follow it,

00:48:13.081 --> 00:48:15.899
or there is compulsion or you are disciplined,

00:48:15.924 --> 00:48:19.825
but you just don’t like to do wrong things, to say something

00:48:19.850 --> 00:48:24.951
which is not respectful, which is not helpful, which is not loving.

00:48:25.212 --> 00:48:29.137
This is the quality of a Sahaja Yogi,

00:48:29.185 --> 00:48:31.907
where you become the Spirit.

00:48:32.132 --> 00:48:35.294
Becoming the Spirit, you don’t have to tell anybody,

00:48:35.350 --> 00:48:39.057
so obvious, so evident and one can see that,

00:48:39.171 --> 00:48:43.757
and the more you go deep into yourself, you find that

00:48:43.844 --> 00:48:49.441
you are endowed with such greatness within you,

00:48:49.466 --> 00:48:54.988
such beautiful feelings, such nice things within you

00:48:55.013 --> 00:48:59.436
that you overcome the ego of others.

00:48:59.595 --> 00:49:01.315
I must tell you a story.

00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:04.878
Once I went to see a saint.

00:49:05.073 --> 00:49:06.280
So the Sahaja Yogis said,

00:49:06.281 --> 00:49:09.544
"Mother, You never go and see these gurus and this and that,

00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:11.935
so why do You go?"
I said, "You come along with Me."

00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:13.459
So we had to climb a lot.

00:49:13.484 --> 00:49:15.436
I said, "From here you see his vibrations.

00:49:15.461 --> 00:49:17.082
First you see his vibrations.”

00:49:17.589 --> 00:49:20.227
So lots of vibrations were coming.

00:49:20.252 --> 00:49:24.493
So we went up the hill, climbed up.

00:49:24.808 --> 00:49:29.541
And this gentleman was supposed to have powers

00:49:29.629 --> 00:49:35.712
that he could control the rain, and it started raining,

00:49:35.823 --> 00:49:40.969
and raining very heavily,
and I got completely drenched in that rain.

00:49:41.090 --> 00:49:44.605
When I went up I saw him sitting on a stone,

00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:48.163
just shaking his head with anger or I don’t know what.

00:49:48.648 --> 00:49:51.531
So I went into his cave and sat down.

00:49:52.333 --> 00:49:57.578
So he came back, he came back and he said to Me,

00:49:57.603 --> 00:50:02.628
"Mother, why didn’t You allow me to stop the rain?

00:50:02.779 --> 00:50:06.044
Is it to overcome my ego?"

00:50:06.069 --> 00:50:10.218
I said, "No, not that, I didn’t want,

00:50:10.243 --> 00:50:14.938
I didn’t see your ego anywhere; but the problem is the another.

00:50:15.104 --> 00:50:18.631
You are a sanyasi, you are a one who are an ascetic,

00:50:18.656 --> 00:50:20.296
you bought a sari for Me.

00:50:20.425 --> 00:50:24.899
Now if you bought a sari for Me,
I can’t take from you because you’re a sanyasi.

00:50:24.924 --> 00:50:30.381
So I had to get drenched,
so that I will have to borrow sari from you."

00:50:30.406 --> 00:50:34.606
And the whole thing melted away.

00:50:34.829 --> 00:50:37.729
He became a very different person.

00:50:37.754 --> 00:50:42.807
So with wisdom you know how to handle different types of people.

00:50:42.893 --> 00:50:49.781
You say things by which you melt their ego.

00:50:49.946 --> 00:50:59.395
Their conditionings also are brought into a kind of a new awakening.

00:51:00.546 --> 00:51:06.597
They see in you that wisdom, that love, that expression of,

00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:09.248
I should say, your Spirit.

00:51:09.454 --> 00:51:16.387
And that’s how so many saints,
though they were tortured and troubled by many,

00:51:16.426 --> 00:51:21.710
but they were definitely very much respected and loved.

00:51:22.124 --> 00:51:30.968
But those saints in those days, I must say,
were definitely very nice and good people,

00:51:31.076 --> 00:51:38.286
but one thing was there: they were rather strict
and disciplining with their disciples.

00:51:38.428 --> 00:51:43.206
The reason was that they were not realized souls, their disciples,

00:51:43.262 --> 00:51:48.805
and these gurus thought that “Unless and until
ou discipline these people,

00:51:48.916 --> 00:51:52.389
they’ll never rise, they’ll never become something great,

00:51:52.445 --> 00:51:54.575
so they have to be disciplined.”

00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:57.762
And those who were seekers of truth accepted

00:51:57.787 --> 00:52:01.409
that "All right, whatever you say, we’ll do.

00:52:01.513 --> 00:52:04.125
Even if you ask us to fast, we’ll do it.”

00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:06.979
They’ll stand on their heads, “All right, stand on our heads.

00:52:06.979 --> 00:52:10.304
Do what you say, and we will be willing to do it.

00:52:10.329 --> 00:52:12.893
You don’t have to worry on that point."

00:52:12.918 --> 00:52:15.905
And that’s how they were very disciplining type.

00:52:15.930 --> 00:52:19.410
But in Sahaja Yoga there is no discipline taught.

00:52:19.694 --> 00:52:22.985
The reason is, you are realized souls,

00:52:23.010 --> 00:52:27.738
your Spirit is there and the Spirit gives you the light.

00:52:27.857 --> 00:52:33.687
In that light you see yourself so clearly,
and you can discipline yourself.

00:52:33.789 --> 00:52:35.679
I don’t have to tell you.

00:52:35.704 --> 00:52:40.267
You know that so many people have given up drugs overnight,

00:52:40.307 --> 00:52:43.178
but I never told them, I never even talked about  drugs

00:52:43.203 --> 00:52:46.123
or anything, and how did they do it?

00:52:46.148 --> 00:52:50.784
Because they had the light, and this is what is you have got today,

00:52:50.809 --> 00:52:53.098
is the light of the Spirit.

00:52:53.162 --> 00:52:56.436
You become absolutely independent

00:52:56.571 --> 00:53:00.444
and absolutely free; complete freedom,

00:53:00.492 --> 00:53:02.993
because you have the light.

00:53:03.104 --> 00:53:08.774
You cannot do, you cannot do wrong things.

00:53:09.741 --> 00:53:14.280
Supposing now there is light,

00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:20.336
and there is some sort of a big explosion taking place.

00:53:20.563 --> 00:53:23.611
I won’t run towards the explosion, no.

00:53:23.682 --> 00:53:28.325
You won’t run either, because you have got the eyes.

00:53:28.350 --> 00:53:33.410
So the Spirit and its light is the greatest guiding factor

00:53:33.736 --> 00:53:38.283
by which you become, as I said, gunatit,

00:53:40.389 --> 00:53:46.550
you become kalatit, and you become dharmatit.

00:53:47.152 --> 00:53:49.456
You are not slave of anything.

00:53:49.481 --> 00:53:53.226
You are not slave of your watch, you are not slave of time,

00:53:53.251 --> 00:53:58.387
you are not slave as to what is your gunas are.

00:53:58.513 --> 00:54:03.790
You don’t want to see whether
you are right-sided, left-sided or centered.

00:54:04.078 --> 00:54:11.886
You are a Sahaja Yogi, and a Sahaja Yogi is beyond all these things,
so you are gunatit.

00:54:12.193 --> 00:54:16.542
You are dharmatit because dharma becomes part and parcel of you.

00:54:16.597 --> 00:54:21.248
You don’t have to follow any disciplining of dharma.

00:54:21.273 --> 00:54:27.282
I have seen in Sahaja Yoga, in some of the ashrams
they are very strict.

00:54:27.512 --> 00:54:28.725
That should not be so.

00:54:28.750 --> 00:54:31.057
I have told them never to be strict.

00:54:31.082 --> 00:54:35.436
If somebody doesn’t get up at, say, four o’clock, doesn’t matter.

00:54:35.475 --> 00:54:37.739
Let him get up at ten o’clock.

00:54:37.814 --> 00:54:41.673
After some time he himself will get up at four,

00:54:41.706 --> 00:54:44.568
but don’t try to discipline them too much.

00:54:44.687 --> 00:54:47.707
Children also you should not discipline too much.

00:54:47.865 --> 00:54:52.701
Of course if they are realized souls, they themselves are so good,

00:54:52.726 --> 00:54:54.198
they are so beautiful.

00:54:54.223 --> 00:54:57.378
But if they are not, try to give them Realization.

00:54:57.403 --> 00:55:01.005
Once you realize that those who are not realized

00:55:01.069 --> 00:55:05.361
are making all these mistakes, that they are in the darkness,

00:55:05.386 --> 00:55:09.097
your attitude towards them will change.

00:55:09.197 --> 00:55:13.786
You will just try to be extremely patient

00:55:14.231 --> 00:55:18.238
and kind, and affectionate and loving,

00:55:18.303 --> 00:55:21.435
because you will know that person is not realized.

00:55:21.586 --> 00:55:26.220
He has not got his eyes, he can’t see, he is blind,

00:55:26.245 --> 00:55:32.012
he can’t hear, he can’t feel the reality.

00:55:32.273 --> 00:55:34.774
So first let him feel the reality.

00:55:34.799 --> 00:55:37.912
What is the use of giving him a lecture and disciplining?

00:55:37.937 --> 00:55:43.117
Still he’ll go on making mistakes
and troubling himself, or troubling others.

00:55:43.142 --> 00:55:45.456
So this is what you have achieved

00:55:45.481 --> 00:55:50.481
through your enlightenment, that you are beyond all these things.

00:55:51.148 --> 00:55:54.976
And you become a person of a temperament

00:55:55.048 --> 00:56:00.912
which is so loving and so joy-giving.

00:56:01.141 --> 00:56:06.604
I mean, it’s so many examples I can give in Sahaja Yoga
which has happened,

00:56:06.673 --> 00:56:11.483
that I have seen the beauty of their love and affection,

00:56:11.508 --> 00:56:15.464
not only towards Me, but only towards others also.

00:56:15.489 --> 00:56:21.135
Only if it is only towards Me I can explain it,

00:56:21.247 --> 00:56:26.494
but I can’t explain the way they are kind to people,
as I told you yesterday,

00:56:26.519 --> 00:56:28.746
that these people went to Israel,

00:56:28.771 --> 00:56:32.240
now they went to Egypt, they went to Russia.

00:56:32.265 --> 00:56:33.249
Who told them?

00:56:33.249 --> 00:56:35.625
I never asked anybody to go anywhere.

00:56:35.650 --> 00:56:39.191
On their own they felt they have to go  and do this job,

00:56:39.216 --> 00:56:44.750
and they have to help people to get out of their ignorance.

00:56:46.063 --> 00:56:50.550
So today, on such a day when you are celebrating

00:56:50.693 --> 00:56:55.446
My seventy-fifth Birthday, and so many balloons are there -

00:57:10.964 --> 00:57:16.266
they are very remarkably, very picturesque

00:57:16.291 --> 00:57:21.953
and have colors of different types, expressing your love for Me.

00:57:23.297 --> 00:57:26.189
In everything I see your love.

00:57:26.310 --> 00:57:30.641
Whatever you have done here, all your decorations, everything,

00:57:30.776 --> 00:57:36.244
I feel My children are so loving.

00:57:36.626 --> 00:57:41.702
I have done nothing for you,
I don’t know what makes you feel such gratitude.

00:57:41.845 --> 00:57:44.350
I still want to know, what have I done?

00:57:44.375 --> 00:57:45.881
I have done nothing!

00:57:45.906 --> 00:57:48.951
But the way you want to express your love,

00:57:49.031 --> 00:57:53.438
it’s very surprising; except for, I would say,

00:57:53.463 --> 00:57:58.123
that you got the light of your Spirit.

00:57:58.222 --> 00:58:03.275
In that light, might be you see something different in Me,

00:58:04.347 --> 00:58:11.069
but the way you are showing your gratitude is really beyond Me.

00:58:11.195 --> 00:58:14.090
As the other day, one of the speakers said that

00:58:14.115 --> 00:58:16.845
“You don’t thank your mother, take her for granted.”

00:58:16.870 --> 00:58:17.950
It’s a fact.

00:58:18.123 --> 00:58:21.913
There’s no need to thank Me, you have to take Me for granted.

00:58:21.938 --> 00:58:25.496
But the way you want to thank Me, just like a

00:58:25.521 --> 00:58:30.682
small little child would like to thank, you just become like children.

00:58:30.929 --> 00:58:33.523
You’re so enthusiastic about it,

00:58:33.555 --> 00:58:39.881
and you don’t understand that
normally is not done like this anywhere;

00:58:39.976 --> 00:58:45.900
nobody tries to be just like children expressing
their beautiful love.

00:58:46.342 --> 00:58:51.494
It’s a very new thing that one can see.

00:58:51.643 --> 00:58:57.201
Such peace, such love, such joy all around

00:58:57.495 --> 00:59:02.778
in a far-fetched place like this, how could you do that?

00:59:03.212 --> 00:59:05.021
How could you manage that?

00:59:05.346 --> 00:59:12.587
It’s not easy to understand,
it’s not for human beings to see that.

00:59:13.275 --> 00:59:17.057
They just don’t understand how these people are like this,

00:59:17.097 --> 00:59:21.436
and why are they living like this so happily?

00:59:21.887 --> 00:59:27.337
Now you have comforts in the house,
you are living so well in your houses,

00:59:27.488 --> 00:59:30.591
everything is there, but here in this scout-ground

00:59:30.608 --> 00:59:33.381
it’s not such a comfortable place to live.

00:59:33.406 --> 00:59:36.387
But you can live anywhere, I know, I have seen it.

00:59:36.412 --> 00:59:39.545
Wherever you are, as long as there are Sahaja Yogis around,

00:59:39.593 --> 00:59:41.680
you don’t care for anything.

00:59:41.705 --> 00:59:46.861
And this collective enjoyment of each other,

00:59:47.012 --> 00:59:50.384
without any expectation, without any criticism,

00:59:50.409 --> 00:59:55.429
without any gossip or any nonsense like that, is so beautiful.

00:59:55.461 --> 00:59:59.716
And even when you pull each other’s legs,
you know, I enjoy your jokes

00:59:59.741 --> 01:00:06.416
and understand that it’s such friendship,
such beautiful friendship.

01:00:06.534 --> 01:00:13.037
Whether you are from India or from England
or from America, or from any other place,

01:00:13.062 --> 01:00:17.217
you find there’s such oneness of understanding,

01:00:17.321 --> 01:00:23.468
oneness of movement,  like one waves rises

01:00:23.493 --> 01:00:27.123
and another wave rises, and another wave rises.

01:00:27.148 --> 01:00:35.306
It’s continuous, eternal, and this is
what one has to achieve for others also.

01:00:35.539 --> 01:00:41.053
For that also, must remember that
you have the light; others don’t have.

01:00:41.099 --> 01:00:46.533
So you have to be very considerate, tolerant and understanding

01:00:46.558 --> 01:00:51.404
about their problem, and just listen to them.

01:00:51.490 --> 01:00:52.817
What is their problem?

01:00:52.842 --> 01:00:57.709
First they’ll tell you that “My business is going down,”

01:00:57.765 --> 01:01:02.868
or they might say that  “My wife is no good,”

01:01:02.947 --> 01:01:07.714
or “My son has no job, he is not working.”

01:01:07.749 --> 01:01:10.250
All kinds of things they might tell you.

01:01:10.275 --> 01:01:14.613
Listen, listen to them, for them it is important, all right.

01:01:14.638 --> 01:01:20.871
After that you will find gradually, you see,
they’ll soothe down

01:01:20.999 --> 01:01:26.318
because you are emitting love,  you are emitting joy,

01:01:26.350 --> 01:01:32.978
you are emitting confidence through your spiritual awakening.

01:01:33.003 --> 01:01:35.657
You have those powers.

01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:40.232
You just stand anywhere and you can create peace in that place,

01:01:40.257 --> 01:01:42.879
you can create happiness in that place.

01:01:42.930 --> 01:01:49.284
So be confident, don’t lose your confidence.

01:01:49.435 --> 01:01:56.527
Also your wisdom to understand others will be very much convincing

01:01:56.552 --> 01:02:01.238
for other people to understand that
“They are something exceptional.

01:02:01.317 --> 01:02:04.553
They don’t get angry, they don’t get into temper,

01:02:04.609 --> 01:02:08.453
they are not mad people,
they are not after some sort of a craze -

01:02:08.478 --> 01:02:12.886
just very, very balanced people."

01:02:13.302 --> 01:02:15.675
And this you don’t have to practice.

01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:16.995
It is there.

01:02:17.034 --> 01:02:20.345
It is within you, and you should be proud of it.

01:02:20.704 --> 01:02:26.044
You should not think that it is something

01:02:26.132 --> 01:02:31.406
that you have to achieve, or to become.

01:02:31.431 --> 01:02:34.154
You have it, within yourself you have it.

01:02:34.179 --> 01:02:39.799
Only thing that you have to see in the light of the Spirit yourself.

01:02:41.187 --> 01:02:46.510
It just is a very simple thing, and that works out.

01:02:46.964 --> 01:02:51.279
It is not easy for others to understand you,

01:02:51.398 --> 01:02:54.470
but it should be very easy to understand them;

01:02:54.495 --> 01:02:57.405
because you were like that before,

01:02:57.430 --> 01:03:04.749
and now they are seeing you and they will become like you.

01:03:05.624 --> 01:03:07.191
It’s very simple.

01:03:07.216 --> 01:03:11.815
You can see this, that I started Sahaja Yoga with one lady.

01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:14.278
And now today, see how many are there.

01:03:14.310 --> 01:03:17.719
Now what have I done, I really don’t know, what have I done?

01:03:17.719 --> 01:03:19.791
I have no idea.

01:03:19.824 --> 01:03:24.296
And what you think, such gratitude and enjoyment and joy!

01:03:25.145 --> 01:03:27.946
So all these things, whatever I have told you,

01:03:28.177 --> 01:03:33.718
you have to be aware of your being,  of your own Self,

01:03:33.766 --> 01:03:38.986
of your Spirit, that you are the Spirit.

01:03:39.222 --> 01:03:44.593
And as you are the Spirit, you are beyond all these things.

01:03:44.775 --> 01:03:51.308
And once that happens, you’ll be amazed what a personality you are.

01:03:51.768 --> 01:06:44.579
(Shri Mataji continues in Hindi)
