00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:29.681
I’m just trying to remember if I had a more
fantastic birthday than this!

00:04:32.678 --> 00:04:44.641
Where words do not come, there the joy
cannot be expressed.

00:04:45.582 --> 00:04:52.753
When it becomes so deep, that there is no movement.

00:04:57.253 --> 00:04:59.476
This is a great country.

00:04:59.553 --> 00:05:04.376
Australia has been created

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:12.821
for a special purpose in Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:16.329 --> 00:05:28.748
This is the Mooladhara chakra, where resides Shri Ganesha, of this world.

00:05:30.252 --> 00:05:42.444
How important it is to keep this centre awakened within us.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.258
The information about my coming

00:05:50.965 --> 00:05:57.047
can only be broadcasted from this centre.

00:05:57.248 --> 00:06:01.766
Then the world Kundalini is going to rise.

00:06:01.967 --> 00:06:05.248
When you are putting your hands towards me,

00:06:05.503 --> 00:06:13.554
then the divine love passes through
your fingers,

00:06:13.791 --> 00:06:20.905
goes down through your Ida and Pingala

00:06:21.106 --> 00:06:28.818
and informs Shri Ganesha about my presence

00:06:29.032 --> 00:06:33.240
and then the Kundalini rises.

00:06:38.237 --> 00:06:53.058
So today, we should say, is a great day
in the history of divine work,

00:06:54.029 --> 00:06:59.313
where I came to Australia.

00:07:01.908 --> 00:07:07.279
They asked me, “Was there any incarnation
in Australia?"

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:13.586
Did God visit Australia in human form?

00:07:14.008 --> 00:07:21.236
I said, “It’s not easy to reach Shri Ganesh!”

00:07:21.437 --> 00:07:26.932
Even Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh could not reach Shri Ganesh.

00:07:27.133 --> 00:07:33.714
And you know that he is placed like a lotus

00:07:33.923 --> 00:07:56.852
where all kinds of people who are insulted,
tortured, ignored, are saved.

00:07:57.715 --> 00:08:07.725
Here he really decides whom to save
from hell, and whom not to save.

00:08:07.926 --> 00:08:11.949
God’s decisions are very different,
they are absolute.

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:17.115
Human decisions are extremely cruel
and blind.

00:08:17.316 --> 00:08:25.032
And today you find so many saints in this
Mooladhara.

00:08:25.233 --> 00:08:31.029
This is the work of Shri Ganesh.

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:35.976
He has called you on this great chakra

00:08:36.177 --> 00:08:42.839
where Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha
also cannot enter in it

00:08:43.055 --> 00:08:49.266
that you should stay here and grow
into beautiful saints

00:08:49.467 --> 00:08:53.941
of very great magnitude in spirituality.

00:08:54.142 --> 00:08:59.827
Such glory is to him, is such a fortunate thing,

00:09:00.028 --> 00:09:03.191
and such a blessing,

00:09:03.392 --> 00:09:09.080
that even Indians could be jealous of you.

00:09:16.841 --> 00:09:27.269
One has to see how Shri Ganesha acts within us.

00:09:27.527 --> 00:09:32.392
It’s very important to recognise him,

00:09:32.448 --> 00:09:36.792
to understand him and to imbibe,

00:09:36.993 --> 00:09:43.481
otherwise, you will be wasting all His
energies staying in this place,

00:09:43.682 --> 00:09:49.742
living in this place, so close to him.

00:09:53.484 --> 00:09:57.204
And though he is the giver of wisdom,

00:09:57.413 --> 00:10:04.059
I wonder how many people understand
the word ‘wisdom’.

00:10:04.605 --> 00:10:09.978
Wisdom is the centre of gravity within us

00:10:10.179 --> 00:10:16.317
which gives us the fulcrum on which
we rotate,

00:10:16.518 --> 00:10:19.726
by which we realise that we are inclined

00:10:19.927 --> 00:10:23.833
to the left or to the right.

00:10:26.441 --> 00:10:35.585
This fulcrum we have to be aware of,

00:10:35.786 --> 00:10:40.417
because otherwise we will not know
how far we have gone.

00:10:40.618 --> 00:10:47.496
Not only [that], but we should know that it is so much

00:10:47.697 --> 00:10:55.624
the centre of gravity and our fulcrum - so close.

00:10:55.825 --> 00:11:02.301
Because if your centre of gravity and
fulcrum are separated

00:11:02.502 --> 00:11:05.139
there’s no integration.

00:11:05.202 --> 00:11:09.139
You can be ruined completely.

00:11:10.076 --> 00:11:19.189
So wisdom means this integration between
your understanding

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:30.281
and the understanding of Shri Ganesha, within you.

00:11:31.293 --> 00:11:39.848
For example, we go to extremes, extremes of behaviour.

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:43.397
I would give you a very simple example:

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:46.397
I was going to Hong Kong

00:11:46.988 --> 00:11:52.732
and the lady who organised it,
she telephoned to me again and again

00:11:52.933 --> 00:11:59.006
and she told me that, “A big batch of people are coming to receive you

00:11:59.667 --> 00:12:07.062
and you are going to be on the television
from the moment you land..

00:12:07.263 --> 00:12:09.553
and this is going to happen and that is going to happen”.

00:12:09.754 --> 00:12:11.820
Every day spending so much money.

00:12:11.848 --> 00:12:14.820
Describing to me the scene

00:12:15.021 --> 00:12:20.362
that I’ll be a “hot news” and all sorts of things, you see,

00:12:20.421 --> 00:12:23.362
encourage lots of people to come and see you

00:12:23.918 --> 00:12:27.036
And she was on and on and on.

00:12:27.118 --> 00:12:31.036
And also, she told Dr Warren

00:12:31.246 --> 00:12:36.490
except for giving the newspaper [advert] she didn’t
have to pay for it.

00:12:39.984 --> 00:12:43.160
It was going too far.

00:12:46.525 --> 00:12:51.280
At that juncture, just it was not necessary

00:12:52.006 --> 00:12:56.830
to go to such a limit and plan it out that there will be people coming

00:12:57.031 --> 00:12:59.848
inside the aeroplane to receive me

00:12:59.948 --> 00:13:01.383
makes no difference to me!

00:13:01.584 --> 00:13:06.009
And there would be a car waiting near
the aeroplane just to receive me.

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:13.915
I don’t know! I don’t know who was waiting
where, at every point!

00:13:14.696 --> 00:13:17.307
And when we reached there, it was six
hours late

00:13:17.555 --> 00:13:22.772
and I told Warren, “It’s all going to be a fizzled out, take it easy!”

00:13:25.759 --> 00:13:30.543
And the plane just deposited us in Bangkok!

00:13:30.759 --> 00:13:34.943
There was no way – six hours.

00:13:35.144 --> 00:13:38.263
And we had to take another plane

00:13:38.464 --> 00:13:43.494
in which nobody came in

00:13:43.504 --> 00:13:45.494
no car

00:13:45.504 --> 00:13:46.494
nothing.

00:13:46.695 --> 00:13:50.400
We went down looking for her, couldn’t see
her.

00:13:50.601 --> 00:13:55.442
Telephoned to the hotel, they said, “No arrangements thrown.”

00:13:55.643 --> 00:14:00.433
Warren thought, “Mother has gone to another extreme now!”

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:09.553
Quite worried that there’s no one to receive us at the airport in Hong Kong.

00:14:09.831 --> 00:14:12.152
It’s all a joke

00:14:12.353 --> 00:14:17.879
Going to extremes has to be corrected in you as well.

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:21.758
because if you get successful with your this kind of planning,

00:14:21.959 --> 00:14:24.675
then you’ll go on doing this kind of artificial planning

00:14:24.876 --> 00:14:27.935
and not the planning of the divine.

00:14:28.136 --> 00:14:30.824
The divine has its own plans

00:14:30.848 --> 00:14:33.824
and we have to feel the plans of the divine.

00:14:34.025 --> 00:14:38.679
It works it out. You are just an instrument to work it out.

00:14:38.888 --> 00:14:46.573
So if you try to do something of your own,
something too much,

00:14:46.774 --> 00:14:53.010
then who is going to suggest the balance - is Shri Ganesh

00:14:53.211 --> 00:14:57.481
And that balance, once it’s established in you

00:14:57.682 --> 00:15:00.985
you know how you should balance yourself.

00:15:01.182 --> 00:15:03.985
Now, there is no alternative

00:15:04.186 --> 00:15:08.014
for Sahaj Yog, no alternative.

00:15:08.086 --> 00:15:10.014
One must know.

00:15:10.614 --> 00:15:13.765
Everything that is living has no alternatives.

00:15:13.966 --> 00:15:22.474
For example, if a mango tree says that,
“I will create a pomegranate,” it cannot!

00:15:22.683 --> 00:15:28.202
There’s no alternatives. Whatever is there, it has to see and enjoy;

00:15:28.403 --> 00:15:31.241
but not to force its way on it.

00:15:31.442 --> 00:15:34.879
This is one of the things we have to understand

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:38.935
to establish our wisdom.

00:15:39.931 --> 00:15:50.003
Because of our concept, our idea, our anything,

00:15:50.204 --> 00:15:58.456
even about God for example, about our achievements itself,

00:15:58.657 --> 00:16:03.543
can be absolutely wrong if you have no wisdom.

00:16:03.744 --> 00:16:12.562
But in nature, if you see, those who grow

00:16:12.763 --> 00:16:16.959
are never bothered about what shape
they are going to take, do they?

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:23.566
Does a tree measure itself up to know how
many dimensions it is going to grow?

00:16:23.767 --> 00:16:27.588
It grows as much as it can

00:16:27.767 --> 00:16:30.188
slowly, steadily

00:16:30.389 --> 00:16:35.492
in coordination with nature itself.

00:16:35.693 --> 00:16:46.144
Like that, the wisdom is the one that understands.

00:16:47.751 --> 00:16:51.327
It is an establishment, is a state of mind.

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:57.725
We can say it’s the state of being, when you become wisdom.

00:16:59.574 --> 00:17:07.175
Such a wisdom outside, also expresses so beautifully.

00:17:07.376 --> 00:17:13.841
Such a wisdom gives you a gentleman and a gentlelady

00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:24.286
only in a personality which is settled down.

00:17:22.124 --> 00:17:25.121
the magnetism that is in the Mother Earth"

00:17:24.776 --> 00:17:27.070
If you are frustrated

00:17:27.076 --> 00:17:29.070
and if there’s a problem

00:17:29.271 --> 00:17:32.763
if you are unhappy, if you are suppressed

00:17:32.964 --> 00:17:42.332
any extremes will not allow this flower of wisdom to grow.

00:17:42.533 --> 00:17:45.318
So even in frustration you have to look back,

00:17:45.519 --> 00:17:48.099
you have to stand back and see for yourself,

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.253
“Why am I to be so frustrated?”

00:17:50.454 --> 00:17:56.068
Count your blessings one by one.

00:17:56.248 --> 00:17:58.068
Count your blessings one by one.

00:17:58.269 --> 00:18:04.482
I’ll say again, count your blessings one by one.

00:18:04.683 --> 00:18:06.564
Once you start counting your blessings,

00:18:06.765 --> 00:18:13.068
you will find in such a short time, where are you.

00:18:14.442 --> 00:18:17.679
Now the extreme projections of the mind can take you to:

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:24.079
“I’m not going to face!” and you would like to do it.

00:18:29.276 --> 00:18:38.070
But in wise projection, you can see this, that you are what you have to be.

00:18:38.271 --> 00:18:41.585
You are saints.

00:18:42.595 --> 00:18:46.059
You were born to be saints in this great country.

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:49.636
You are specially blessed people in the heavens,

00:18:49.837 --> 00:18:59.238
and are sent on this Earth to do this Maha Yoga, to spread it.

00:18:59.439 --> 00:19:01.921
You have achieved that state.

00:19:02.122 --> 00:19:07.272
And if you are saints, you should not be bothered as to a few things like,

00:19:07.473 --> 00:19:12.348
“Oh! I haven’t got a suitcase” or something
sort of a thing like that

00:19:12.549 --> 00:19:15.470
which you have never been very much bothered before.

00:19:15.671 --> 00:19:17.848
Can you see that?

00:19:17.971 --> 00:19:21.218
Any kind of extreme behaviour

00:19:21.419 --> 00:19:25.703
For example, for materialism you people are not so bad

00:19:25.904 --> 00:19:32.653
in the sense that you understand the value
of aesthetics.

00:19:32.854 --> 00:19:38.130
But in possessiveness let us take the wise
path, the wisdom

00:19:38.331 --> 00:19:39.925
logical, it has to be logical

00:19:39.931 --> 00:19:48.925
What do we possess in this world?

00:19:49.607 --> 00:19:53.649
Just think of one thing that we can possess!

00:19:53.857 --> 00:19:57.560
Except for your own Spirit, you don’t possess anything.

00:19:57.761 --> 00:20:03.118
Except for your evolutionary development, you don’t possess anything.

00:20:03.319 --> 00:20:06.288
For example, now you are a saint you’ll be born a saint always

00:20:06.489 --> 00:20:10.018
this is what you possess

00:20:10.089 --> 00:20:11.018
The rest you don’t possess

00:20:11.219 --> 00:20:13.106
It’s logical, logical.

00:20:13.219 --> 00:20:17.106
You need not to be realised to understand what I am saying.

00:20:20.458 --> 00:20:24.967
So why should we worry about our possessions?

00:20:25.168 --> 00:20:30.073
When you leave this worry, this is another wisdom,

00:20:30.274 --> 00:20:32.124
this is the higher wisdom

00:20:32.274 --> 00:20:35.724
which you develop within yourself.

00:20:35.925 --> 00:20:40.708
And if we leave our possessions, our material problems are solved.

00:20:40.909 --> 00:20:43.348
‘Leave’ doesn’t mean you throw them in the sea,

00:20:43.351 --> 00:20:46.848
but the attachment to it dissolves

00:20:46.851 --> 00:20:49.345
It is solved.

00:20:49.351 --> 00:20:51.745
Let me give you an example

00:20:51.946 --> 00:20:55.848
Like Kay lost her travellers’ cheques

00:20:55.946 --> 00:20:58.547
she did not know, she was not knowing

00:20:58.748 --> 00:21:00.848
Suddenly one man bumped into her.

00:21:00.948 --> 00:21:03.025
I was with her.

00:21:03.226 --> 00:21:06.437
He said, “Imagine, I never knew I was going to meet you!”

00:21:06.638 --> 00:21:10.367
He said, “I went to a particular cashier or somebody"

00:21:10.568 --> 00:21:14.751
And he said “Do you know this lady? I’ve got her travellers cheques with me.”

00:21:14.952 --> 00:21:18.829
And here, suddenly, I bump into you!”

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:22.158
Empty

00:21:22.359 --> 00:21:28.561
Empty

00:21:36.272 --> 00:21:39.969
What wisdom, is that magnetism in them"

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:51.537
which tells them, “This is the way you have to go.”

00:21:52.044 --> 00:21:56.100
So we have to see to this magnetism within us:

00:21:56.301 --> 00:22:03.151
What makes us magnetic

00:22:03.477 --> 00:22:07.190
is not what we could have, what unnatural
things we have

00:22:07.391 --> 00:22:09.637
but what naturally we have achieved within

00:22:09.838 --> 00:22:12.834
and we are not afraid to express it

00:22:13.035 --> 00:22:18.134
In fear you are never aggressive

00:22:22.497 --> 00:22:28.801
but even in fearlessness you are never aggressive

00:22:29.002 --> 00:22:35.481
In fear you might say that you are not afraid

00:22:35.682 --> 00:22:39.484
but you could be aggressive

00:22:42.463 --> 00:22:46.131
When people look very frightened, if you push them

00:22:46.332 --> 00:22:51.919
to the extreme of fright, they can come back

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.534
But if you are fearless, you are innocent

00:22:54.548 --> 00:22:58.534
you are just standing and watching

00:23:01.421 --> 00:23:07.942
Fearlessness never means aggression

00:23:09.013 --> 00:23:13.825
So the confusion of our own concepts

00:23:14.026 --> 00:23:16.848
can only be cleared out

00:23:16.849 --> 00:23:19.743
if there is light within us.

00:23:19.944 --> 00:23:25.463
For us, if somebody is aggressing us, then we think

00:23:25.664 --> 00:23:29.193
[that] if we do not aggress the other
person, we are frightened

00:23:29.394 --> 00:23:32.445
then we are useless,

00:23:32.448 --> 00:23:37.845
we are weak, we are weak people

00:23:37.996 --> 00:23:39.848
so we should fight back.

00:23:39.996 --> 00:23:44.546
Even when you are fighting back, you are weak people.

00:23:45.521 --> 00:23:50.673
If it was not so, what is there to fight
back?

00:23:50.874 --> 00:23:55.653
In fearlessness you become the witness.

00:23:55.854 --> 00:23:57.950
You see the joke

00:23:57.964 --> 00:24:01.950
joke behind all this extreme behaviour of another person.

00:24:02.151 --> 00:24:06.268
And also you know the technique, kaushalam.

00:24:06.469 --> 00:24:09.284
Yoga also means kaushalam, it means technique

00:24:09.469 --> 00:24:11.284
how to manage the show

00:24:11.485 --> 00:24:18.049
by which his action doesn’t trouble you

00:24:18.848 --> 00:24:21.049
if you want to.

00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:25.872
If you don’t want, you can even take
the action upon yourself, to prove it

00:24:26.073 --> 00:24:30.641
that, “Whatever you are doing is a little
silly and stupid.”

00:24:30.842 --> 00:24:34.643
Like Christ getting Himself crucified.

00:24:35.411 --> 00:24:39.589
It was a wise decision to do

00:24:41.161 --> 00:24:44.796
because if you have to prove that life is eternal

00:24:44.997 --> 00:24:48.440
the best thing is to die and show.

00:24:48.641 --> 00:24:53.206
And to be [done] publicly, so that nobody
should say that he was not dead.

00:24:53.407 --> 00:24:57.066
Still there are many people who are saying he was not dead.

00:24:57.267 --> 00:25:00.722
Still there are people who are talking this: “He was not dead.

00:25:00.923 --> 00:25:04.971
He was alive. So he got out of the place.”

00:25:05.172 --> 00:25:09.505
Because they don’t know how to explain!

00:25:09.814 --> 00:25:16.147
So he had to die publicly

00:25:16.348 --> 00:25:23.133
and then his resurrection was to be seen
by many people.

00:25:27.317 --> 00:25:31.809
This drama had to be performed

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:39.564
for you to have the wisdom to know that life is eternal.

00:25:40.683 --> 00:25:45.475
It doesn’t mean that he was weak, by any chance.

00:25:49.984 --> 00:25:55.490
So the idea of our aggression, or our suppression

00:25:55.548 --> 00:26:03.149
Both come from either fear

00:26:03.548 --> 00:26:12.149
or some sort of a satanic pleasure

00:26:12.548 --> 00:26:16.149
to oppress others

00:26:16.534 --> 00:26:21.825
So wisdom lies in seeing yourself also

00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:25.123
See how wisdom is so important!

00:26:25.324 --> 00:26:30.596
Throughout if you find, in every chakra resides pranava

00:26:30.797 --> 00:26:33.544
is the life of every chakra.

00:26:33.745 --> 00:26:39.453
Because it is the wisdom that tells you whether you are in the chakra or not.

00:26:40.645 --> 00:26:42.540
So how wisdom is [so] important

00:26:42.645 --> 00:26:45.148
that you even become a sakshi if you have wisdom

00:26:45.248 --> 00:26:46.002
otherwise you cannot

00:26:46.203 --> 00:26:52.447
You become a witness only when you have that focal point

00:26:53.203 --> 00:26:59.848
adjusted to your centre of gravity

00:27:00.172 --> 00:27:03.398
That is wisdom!

00:27:04.409 --> 00:27:07.275
When people tell me about somebody who has harmed them

00:27:07.476 --> 00:27:12.309
they paint such a dark picture of the whole thing

00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:19.306
as if it was another war that was fought.

00:27:21.467 --> 00:27:23.135
Then you go and listen to another side,

00:27:23.336 --> 00:27:28.733
they paint another horrible picture
of this side.

00:27:29.165 --> 00:27:34.415
Between these two pictures you stand.

00:27:34.616 --> 00:27:40.119
You find the one is reflecting the other,
the other is reflecting the other.

00:27:42.846 --> 00:27:50.200
There is no end to it, it’s eternally going
on from this to that, to that to this.

00:27:52.689 --> 00:27:56.367
How do you end it up?

00:27:57.134 --> 00:28:05.610
Only by your wisdom, by understanding it’s an illusion.

00:28:05.811 --> 00:28:10.020
The main thing is the mirror on which it is reflected,

00:28:10.221 --> 00:28:16.558
It’s just an illusion that is appearing, and we are worried about it.

00:28:16.759 --> 00:28:21.096
The whole illusion will drop out as soon as you just see the mirror

00:28:21.297 --> 00:28:25.310
and don’t worry about the reflections.

00:28:27.694 --> 00:28:33.225
They’ll come and go: it is for you just to witness it, that’s all.

00:28:33.426 --> 00:28:38.049
It’s not..the mirror is a mirror, which is a solid thing,

00:28:38.259 --> 00:28:42.372
and all the reflections are illusions.

00:28:44.691 --> 00:28:53.576
That’s how we miss all the sweetness of our own being.

00:28:58.228 --> 00:29:04.446
Wisdom lies in understanding that you are the Spirit.

00:29:04.653 --> 00:29:07.648
You are not all these illusions. You are the Spirit.

00:29:07.653 --> 00:29:11.340
You are the Spirit.

00:29:11.583 --> 00:29:15.449
The attention was, as animals, was on food only, you can say.

00:29:15.658 --> 00:29:19.600
You were aware of food, nothing else but food only.

00:29:19.801 --> 00:29:22.404
This grows higher and higher in awareness,

00:29:22.605 --> 00:29:25.848
then he came up to a point where he started thinking that

00:29:26.042 --> 00:29:28.848
he is the prime minister

00:29:29.042 --> 00:29:31.262
or he is an actor or an actress

00:29:31.463 --> 00:29:35.085
and this and that and so-called things they have achieved.

00:29:35.286 --> 00:29:40.893
Or maybe they start thinking - oh, they are atheists

00:29:41.094 --> 00:29:43.042
agnostics and all sorts of things, you see.

00:29:43.094 --> 00:29:46.042
Communists!

00:29:46.094 --> 00:29:52.042
And specialists!

00:29:58.964 --> 00:30:00.848
It’s a drama going on!

00:30:01.364 --> 00:30:03.707
They are wearing wigs after wigs.

00:30:03.908 --> 00:30:06.815
If they like this wig they’ll wear this, otherwise throw away!

00:30:07.016 --> 00:30:09.874
This has killed the romance completely!

00:30:10.075 --> 00:30:14.530
You start loving the wigs of a person!

00:30:17.165 --> 00:30:20.924
And wigs can be bought!

00:30:22.848 --> 00:30:24.924
They could be exchanged.

00:30:25.126 --> 00:30:30.753
If you go into the market, you can get about ten types of wigs.

00:30:30.954 --> 00:30:36.903
Supposing you say, “Oh, I like this colour for the hair,”

00:30:37.104 --> 00:30:41.719
so the lady will go and wear that and come out

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:45.694
and then you’ll like her for the wig that she has got

00:30:45.895 --> 00:30:50.485
Then another may wear the same

00:30:50.686 --> 00:30:58.569
Or this same lady, who looks nice with one wig,

00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:01.151
could bore you completely!

00:31:01.352 --> 00:31:09.885
Because there’s no living dynamism, that charisma

00:31:10.086 --> 00:31:14.056
Every moment is so beautiful

00:31:14.086 --> 00:31:16.096
It breaks into new waves

00:31:16.197 --> 00:31:20.023
of such beautiful colours and beautiful music.

00:31:20.224 --> 00:31:26.267
That’s all lost with these bought images.

00:31:26.468 --> 00:31:31.987
Every minute the image changes, with a living personality,

00:31:32.188 --> 00:31:33.761
into tremendous beauty.

00:31:33.888 --> 00:31:35.761
But the first point is the wisdom

00:31:35.962 --> 00:31:38.688
to know that our images cannot be purchased

00:31:38.889 --> 00:31:41.848
or bought or created or made.

00:31:41.889 --> 00:31:45.523
They evolve!

00:31:46.874 --> 00:31:50.131
So we have to only see to our evolving force..

00:31:50.332 --> 00:31:53.160
are we nearer it or are we out of it?

00:31:53.369 --> 00:31:57.848
Are we moving with our evolving force

00:31:58.043 --> 00:32:01.879
Of getting ourselves crucified

00:32:02.043 --> 00:32:10.079
with all these artificial misidentifications that says that,

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:12.148
You are this, you are that.

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:14.698
You are nothing but a seeker.

00:32:14.899 --> 00:32:17.383
It’s a category, I have told many-a-times

00:32:17.499 --> 00:32:19.383
that you are a seeker and you have to seek

00:32:19.584 --> 00:32:23.361
Now, what do you seek? Is your Spirit.

00:32:23.562 --> 00:32:26.397
And once you have found it, establish yourself on that.

00:32:26.562 --> 00:32:27.697
That’s what you are!

00:32:27.898 --> 00:32:34.169
And to know that you are that Spirit itself is so satisfying

00:32:34.370 --> 00:32:40.189
is itself emitting wisdom in you

00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:42.848
Which is so joy giving

00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:44.848
and is nothing but love

00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:46.789
It’s love, I tell you!

00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:49.355
I mean, I cannot go beyond this.

00:32:49.556 --> 00:32:56.988
There’s no word in human language to say
what is love.

00:32:57.189 --> 00:33:01.085
To me it is nothing but silence.

00:33:01.189 --> 00:33:04.585
Everything stops at that point.

00:33:04.786 --> 00:33:09.567
This feeling within yourself, where the wisdom is becoming love,

00:33:09.768 --> 00:33:11.971
and love becomes wisdom.

00:33:12.068 --> 00:33:16.971
that’s the real integration of life.

00:33:17.172 --> 00:33:19.810
Open your hearts!

00:33:19.848 --> 00:33:25.848
Allow Shri Ganesha to be settled in that

00:33:26.011 --> 00:33:29.094
That innocence which enhances everything.

00:33:29.295 --> 00:33:31.139
Look at the little ones.

00:33:31.295 --> 00:33:33.139
How they came forward to give me flowers.

00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:38.588
Every step, every movement was so joyous

00:33:38.789 --> 00:33:43.291
was creating such a beautiful, delicate ripple in my heart.

00:33:43.492 --> 00:33:47.940
And it’s written as history for me,

00:33:48.141 --> 00:33:55.007
to see these little, little sweet, innocent Ganeshas coming forward

00:33:55.393 --> 00:33:59.778
And the wisdom becomes so powerful

00:33:59.979 --> 00:34:04.496
that you know the source of love as Ganesha in you.

00:34:04.697 --> 00:34:07.382
For him, he did not know anybody else but one

00:34:07.448 --> 00:34:11.682
That which is the source of love.

00:34:12.968 --> 00:34:18.680
Never questioned, never argued. No alternatives!

00:34:18.881 --> 00:34:25.817
No new ideas came to his mind.

00:34:25.848 --> 00:34:28.817
It's just taking in.

00:34:29.018 --> 00:34:35.628
Working it out within yourself and the whole thing just works out.

00:34:35.829 --> 00:34:40.628
The more you enter into it, you will
understand that you have really entered

00:34:40.829 --> 00:34:44.055
into the Kingdom of God where he looks after everyone.

00:34:44.148 --> 00:34:45.848
You want a house? All right, have it!

00:34:45.923 --> 00:34:50.035
What do you want? You want that? Alright!

00:34:50.123 --> 00:34:51.035
You have a problem? Have it.

00:34:51.236 --> 00:34:55.328
It’s all God’s, the own thing. Who owns it but God?

00:34:55.529 --> 00:34:59.826
He is the One who owns everything and He’s
the One who enjoys everything.

00:35:00.027 --> 00:35:03.527
And he wants you to enjoy everything.

00:35:03.728 --> 00:35:10.650
Only through the power of your wisdom that you can achieve it

00:35:10.851 --> 00:35:19.204
Today, You all have to show a part of that achievement in your wisdom

00:35:19.405 --> 00:35:25.281
in which there is no artificiality. It’s so natural.

00:35:26.434 --> 00:35:31.508
But natural doesn’t mean baser. Some
people think to be angry is also natural.

00:35:31.709 --> 00:35:35.566
But you are a human being and
a Sahaja Yogi.

00:35:35.767 --> 00:35:38.626
Whatever is natural to a Sahaja Yogi

00:35:38.827 --> 00:35:43.908
is not the same as whatever is natural
to a buffalo.

00:35:44.881 --> 00:35:49.453
We have nothing to learn from them,
they have to learn from us.

00:35:49.654 --> 00:35:53.712
So whatever is natural to a Sahaja Yogi

00:35:53.913 --> 00:35:57.764
has to be learnt in the school of wisdom.

00:35:57.965 --> 00:36:01.409
Not by any rules or anything

00:36:01.610 --> 00:36:04.209
that I say, “You don’t do this,” and, “You do this!”

00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:09.777
“You are not to do like that.” “You are not
to do this way!”

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:21.203
Even in the hand if you see: this portion is Australia.

00:36:21.984 --> 00:36:27.680
Now just see: this portion is the source for all the fingers

00:36:27.881 --> 00:36:31.231
is the connecting point, this is your point

00:36:31.281 --> 00:36:35.631
But it doesn’t say anything!

00:36:35.832 --> 00:36:39.336
For example, this thumb means something,

00:36:39.537 --> 00:36:40.848
this finger means something

00:36:40.849 --> 00:36:41.985
this means something

00:36:42.186 --> 00:36:47.106
but this doesn’t say anything, doesn’t do anything.

00:36:47.307 --> 00:36:50.303
But without this nothing exists.

00:36:50.504 --> 00:36:55.821
If it is cut out here, you are paralysed,
all the movements are finished, you see.

00:36:56.022 --> 00:37:05.364
This is the connecting link with the divine
and the guiding link.

00:37:05.565 --> 00:37:07.405
This only tells which finger to move

00:37:07.565 --> 00:37:10.405
where to take, how to contract which muscle.

00:37:10.606 --> 00:37:16.588
All of this is controlled in this portion.

00:37:20.498 --> 00:37:25.804
The day will come when the information
will reach the whole world

00:37:26.005 --> 00:37:30.887
through the awakening of Ganesha in my children

00:37:31.005 --> 00:37:33.887
the Sahaja Yogis in Australia.

00:37:34.088 --> 00:37:40.353
And the whole world is going to get the blessings coming into it

00:37:40.554 --> 00:37:44.032
Of course, you know that Kundalini is in India

00:37:44.554 --> 00:37:49.032
and only then the Kundalini can rise.

00:37:49.233 --> 00:37:57.546
But one thing you have to remember

00:37:57.990 --> 00:38:04.843
is that you are really placed at a very pivotal point here

00:38:05.044 --> 00:38:09.980
and that the responsibility is too much on you.

00:38:11.165 --> 00:38:17.773
And the responsibility is to keep the whole atmosphere pure

00:38:17.974 --> 00:38:21.968
and send forth all the fragrance of the lotus.

00:38:22.169 --> 00:38:28.634
Though maybe you will feel you are surrounded by all the mud and everything,

00:38:28.835 --> 00:38:34.940
but still you have to be very strong lotuses.

00:38:35.141 --> 00:38:40.445
For the whole world you have to come up

00:38:40.621 --> 00:38:45.898
and send forth that beautiful fragrance

00:38:46.099 --> 00:38:52.715
of announcement that the Blossom Time has come.

00:38:54.059 --> 00:38:56.888
I was asking for the river’s name

00:38:57.059 --> 00:38:58.888
what’s the name of the river

00:38:59.089 --> 00:39:02.505
I wonder if you thought about it

00:39:02.589 --> 00:39:05.505
See, the river’s name is ‘Parramatta’

00:39:05.706 --> 00:39:10.858
‘Para’ in Greek means ‘above, beyond’ should be Para

00:39:11.059 --> 00:39:14.848
And ‘Mata’ means ‘the mother’

00:39:16.059 --> 00:39:19.827
Your river’s name itself is Parramatta.

00:39:20.028 --> 00:39:26.510
It’s a Greek word and how the Greeks
have known this word ‘Parramatta’?

00:39:26.711 --> 00:39:30.732
This river had to be here, the Adi Shakti itself only, had to be here

00:39:30.933 --> 00:39:34.945
to bless the Ganesha all the time which has to do the work.

00:39:35.146 --> 00:39:40.121
He’s the one who sorts out

00:39:40.146 --> 00:39:42.521
The Lambodara!

00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:50.523
The one you will see in the Sistine Chapel, very well pointed out.

00:39:50.724 --> 00:39:52.429
It’s a huge big stomach.

00:39:52.454 --> 00:39:54.848
It’s really an Australian character, personality,

00:39:56.630 --> 00:40:03.887
standing there, sorting out people,
throwing left to the right.

00:40:04.088 --> 00:40:08.042
It’s so beautiful, I wish you could get
that picture some time.

00:40:08.243 --> 00:40:12.996
And you will be surprised – it’s an
Australian. you can see it perfectly -

00:40:13.197 --> 00:40:16.295
it’s Australian character.

00:40:16.496 --> 00:40:22.784
That is Christ, absolutely an Australian
body, standing up.

00:40:22.985 --> 00:40:27.178
I don’t know how Michelangelo could see that so clearly

00:40:27.379 --> 00:40:32.429
that he had to be Australian like that.

00:40:38.049 --> 00:40:44.201
It has been so beautiful to come down here.

00:40:44.249 --> 00:40:46.201
So beautiful.

00:40:47.458 --> 00:40:56.268
It’s blissful for you maybe, but for me it’s nothing but complete joy.

00:40:56.458 --> 00:41:01.268
complete joy.

00:41:02.952 --> 00:41:10.555
I had told that I will not do anything
after three years time;

00:41:10.756 --> 00:41:12.129
I will just settle down

00:41:12.146 --> 00:41:15.129
because the saintly person is not supposed

00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:17.752
to move from places to places, they must settle down,

00:41:17.953 --> 00:41:22.716
they must have their own round pillow that’s called as takiya,

00:41:22.917 --> 00:41:24.675
and you are not to leave that.

00:41:24.768 --> 00:41:30.675
But I am a Mother who is moving all over.

00:41:30.876 --> 00:41:36.787
And can you imagine, I’ve been all over
the places, but never to Australia before.

00:41:36.988 --> 00:41:45.768
So to come here first thing was so great
that even,

00:41:45.969 --> 00:41:50.859
today I have not been able to put
all that into words.

00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:54.559
May God bless you all.

00:42:18.603 --> 00:42:24.461
You are really the Ganeshas, the amount
of food you have.
