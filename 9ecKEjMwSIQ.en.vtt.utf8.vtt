00:01:50.483 --> 00:01:56.899
Today we are going to understand the center of Agnya.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:08.358
Agnya Chakra, which is placed on the crossing of the 'optic chiasma.'

00:02:08.358 --> 00:02:12.066
The nerves that supply the eyes

00:02:12.066 --> 00:02:16.983
go backwards in the opposite direction

00:02:17.025 --> 00:02:24.775
and wherever they cross, this subtle center is situated.

00:02:24.817 --> 00:02:32.983
It has a continuous connection with the other centers

00:02:33.025 --> 00:02:49.191
through the 'medulla oblongata.' This center has got two petals.

00:02:49.233 --> 00:02:59.734
And this subtle center on one side acts through the eyes

00:02:59.775 --> 00:03:08.317
and at the back of the head where you have some protrusion.

00:03:08.358 --> 00:03:13.108
This is the physical side of this center is.

00:03:13.108 --> 00:03:24.150
Now the people who talk of the third eye, this is the third eye.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.567
So that we have two eyes with which we see

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:31.734
and there is a third eye which is a subtler eye

00:03:31.734 --> 00:03:39.150
through which we can see. If you see this eye,

00:03:39.191 --> 00:03:44.066
that means you are away from it. For example,

00:03:44.108 --> 00:03:47.483
if you can see your eyes that means

00:03:47.483 --> 00:03:50.609
you are seeing your reflection, not the reality.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:04:03.317
If you see anything that means you are looking at it.

00:04:03.358 --> 00:04:09.609
So those people who say they see an eye for example

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.150
people who take LSD and all such things,

00:04:13.191 --> 00:04:18.899
they start seeing another eye. They just see this eye

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.650
and they think their third eye has opened.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.275
Actually you are very much away from the eye,

00:04:28.275 --> 00:04:33.650
that is why you can see it. You go to a supraconscious level

00:04:33.692 --> 00:04:38.191
on the right side and on the left side to the subconscious level,

00:04:38.233 --> 00:04:43.191
you can see the eye. But in Sahaja Yoga you have to see

00:04:43.191 --> 00:04:51.567
'through' that eye. Like a window, you can look at the window,

00:04:51.567 --> 00:04:58.900
but if you see through the window you cannot look at the window.

00:04:58.941 --> 00:05:05.317
So this illusion that people have that we can see third eye

00:05:05.358 --> 00:05:08.567
and that is why our Kundalini is awakened,

00:05:08.609 --> 00:05:10.567
they are sadly mistaken.

00:05:10.567 --> 00:05:16.817
This is a very narrow passage, through which attention

00:05:16.859 --> 00:05:19.899
cannot pass normally, it is impossible thing.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:29.817
It is a narrow passage, where the ego and superego fit on to each other

00:05:29.859 --> 00:05:36.233
and cross each other. And there is no gap in between

00:05:36.275 --> 00:05:44.317
for the Kundalini to pass through. This superego and ego go back,

00:05:44.358 --> 00:05:48.859
go down-ward and come to the Vishuddhi Chakra

00:05:48.899 --> 00:05:52.775
and circle round it and go in the same direction.

00:05:52.817 --> 00:05:59.358
So you find that they come upto this place,

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.900
they start from this place, go upto the Agnya Chakra

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:10.899
and then they cross- over. But here they are in the same direction

00:06:10.899 --> 00:06:13.567
as they went, at Agnya here they cross-over.

00:06:13.567 --> 00:06:19.358
So when you have a problem on the left hand side,

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.275
you get the affects of that on the right hand side.

00:06:23.317 --> 00:06:27.941
But right hand starts from here upto this side

00:06:27.941 --> 00:06:32.317
and the left hand starts from here.

00:06:32.358 --> 00:06:38.775
But the left hand actually acts on the right hand side.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:47.817
So this third eye is to be penetrated through

00:07:47.859 --> 00:07:57.191
or we have to enter into the third eye, through Kundalini awakening.

00:07:57.233 --> 00:08:04.859
But it is such a closed passage which is the door to the limbic area,

00:08:04.859 --> 00:08:12.483
which is the kingdom of God, that anybody who tries

00:08:12.483 --> 00:08:18.066
to push their attention through this closed door,

00:08:18.066 --> 00:08:23.609
either goes to the left or to the right. And this is the beginning

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:27.317
of the trouble of the people when they don't understand

00:08:27.317 --> 00:08:32.442
that whatever is unknown is not God, is not Divine.

00:08:32.483 --> 00:08:37.442
So, when they move on the right side,

00:08:37.483 --> 00:08:40.941
they go to the supraconscious area.

00:08:40.941 --> 00:08:43.567
And they start seeing hallucinations.

00:08:43.567 --> 00:08:47.108
Actually these are not hallucinations but actual things.

00:08:47.108 --> 00:08:49.817
because they exist on the right hand side.

00:08:49.859 --> 00:08:53.066
So they start seeing things of the right hand side.

00:08:53.066 --> 00:09:00.358
They may see colors and the formation of colors, and they may see also

00:09:00.358 --> 00:09:05.734
people who are dead,who have been very egoistical.

00:09:05.734 --> 00:09:11.983
They can see Gandharwas and Kinnaras,

00:09:12.025 --> 00:09:17.650
because they go to the 'Gandharwalok', to the right side,

00:09:17.692 --> 00:09:23.108
and start seeing those things in the unknown awareness

00:09:23.108 --> 00:09:28.150
of supraconsciousness. But that movement is very dangerous.

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:36.108
Because if anybody catches you there, then you get

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:39.150
an added personality sitting on your head,

00:09:39.191 --> 00:09:45.692
and you get possessed by ego and you become on your own

00:09:45.734 --> 00:09:52.400
and you actually become malignant.

00:09:52.442 --> 00:09:55.317
Hitler is one of the examples of that.

00:09:55.317 --> 00:10:02.859
He learnt this from the Tibetan lamas - how to go to the supraconscious.

00:10:02.899 --> 00:10:06.025
And when he learnt it from them, he used it

00:10:06.066 --> 00:10:11.191
and made many people supraconscious, ego-oriented.

00:10:11.191 --> 00:10:15.066
You must have heard about the lama system,

00:10:15.066 --> 00:10:27.108
which was another big problem. They knew the future part,

00:10:27.108 --> 00:10:30.775
who is going to be the next lama. Where you will find him ?

00:10:30.817 --> 00:10:33.983
Where you will get him ? All the future things they knew

00:10:33.983 --> 00:10:38.567
and people thought this was Divine ! To know future is not Divine.

00:10:38.567 --> 00:10:42.358
It is an area which we should never go to.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.734
Because it is an imbalance. We are human beings

00:10:45.775 --> 00:10:50.483
and we have to know the 'present' and 'not' the 'future'.

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:55.317
Once you go through the present stage

00:10:55.317 --> 00:10:57.983
then you reach a height

00:10:58.025 --> 00:11:05.692
from where you can see the past, the present and the future.

00:11:05.692 --> 00:11:09.899
Supposing on the Mother earth, if you have a means

00:11:09.899 --> 00:11:15.442
of going higher and hang yourself there,

00:11:15.483 --> 00:11:19.275
then you can see whatever has passed through,

00:11:19.317 --> 00:11:25.899
and you can also see what is going to come; and wherever you are,

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:30.275
you are in the present. In the same way,

00:11:30.317 --> 00:11:36.483
when a person ascends in reality, in the present,

00:11:36.525 --> 00:11:42.108
he goes at this point in the superconsciousness

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:45.941
from where he sees the supraconscious right side

00:11:45.983 --> 00:11:51.983
and also he can see the subconscious; but he has no interest.

00:11:51.983 --> 00:12:00.983
He wants to rise in the present. And, this is what actually

00:12:01.025 --> 00:12:08.191
the Kundalini awakening is. So all those people who say

00:12:08.191 --> 00:12:11.609
that Kundalini, in the awakening of the Kundalini,

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:16.650
it is very difficult and it is harmful, are the people

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:19.900
who have no right to awaken the Kundalini.

00:12:19.941 --> 00:12:23.692
So when they try to play tricks, actually

00:12:23.734 --> 00:12:27.108
their sympathetic nervous system goes into great agitation.

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:31.442
And this sympathetic system on the left and right side

00:12:31.442 --> 00:12:35.150
starts extracting more energy from the central path.

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:39.442
So, much so, that it gets exhausted and such a person

00:12:39.442 --> 00:12:44.108
becomes actually a mental wreck. So many people who said,

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:47.483
we are raising your Kundalini by this method or that method,

00:12:47.483 --> 00:12:52.899
wreck the life of the Sadhakas. Ultimately they are left high

00:12:52.899 --> 00:12:56.692
and dry without achieving anything. Nobody knows

00:12:56.692 --> 00:13:00.483
what to achieve and what to receive. So they are misled.

00:13:00.483 --> 00:13:12.066
But logically one must understand, that at least your health

00:13:12.066 --> 00:13:16.108
should be all right. Mentally you should be better of.

00:13:16.108 --> 00:13:20.066
Your temperament has to improve; minimum of minimum.

00:13:20.108 --> 00:13:23.567
But if you are losing all your money to the Guru,

00:13:23.609 --> 00:13:27.734
you are losing all your health for this nonsensical experiences,

00:13:27.734 --> 00:13:32.025
and you have no control over yourself, then you must know

00:13:32.025 --> 00:13:35.275
that this is not in anyway the reality.

00:13:35.317 --> 00:13:39.066
Reality is where you are in control.

00:13:39.066 --> 00:13:44.317
If you are in the control of something else, then you are a lost case.

00:13:44.317 --> 00:13:49.734
For example, some people start jumping and they say

00:13:49.734 --> 00:13:55.692
'Mother I start jumping automatically.' That is a serious affair.

00:13:55.734 --> 00:13:58.483
That means you have no control over yourself.

00:13:58.525 --> 00:14:01.025
You are just jumping because somebody is making you jump.

00:14:01.025 --> 00:14:04.525
'You' are not jumping : that means your own 'Chetana'

00:14:04.525 --> 00:14:08.900
your own attention, your own awareness is under the control

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:11.275
of somebody else; you cannot control yourself.

00:14:11.275 --> 00:14:16.108
So all these experience in which people think,

00:14:16.108 --> 00:14:27.191
they are flying in the air or they are having extra-terrestial movements

00:14:27.191 --> 00:14:31.692
and people are going in the air and seeing things --

00:14:31.692 --> 00:14:36.525
all these are very dangerous things. Such a person

00:14:36.567 --> 00:14:39.859
may ultimately become a lunatic. Absolutely.

00:14:39.899 --> 00:14:43.734
Because he loses complete control over himself.

00:14:43.734 --> 00:14:50.317
These are called as parapsychological experiments, in America,

00:14:50.358 --> 00:14:54.317
to give it a big name 'parapsychology.' Of course, it is a para

00:14:54.358 --> 00:15:00.150
because it is beyond the psyche of a person; but is very dangerous.

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:04.233
You are not supposed to get into these muddles

00:15:04.275 --> 00:15:08.066
where the spirits capture you and you start behaving in a manner

00:15:08.066 --> 00:15:15.609
that you cannot explain. Once, about I think five six years back

00:15:15.609 --> 00:15:23.150
or may be more, no about 12 years back, a group of Americans

00:15:23.191 --> 00:15:27.066
came to see me and they told me that 'you must teach us

00:15:27.066 --> 00:15:30.900
how to fly in the air.' I said 'Why ? Aren't you flying ?'.

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:35.358
They said, ''No we want to have that space travel''.

00:15:35.358 --> 00:15:38.233
I said why ?

00:15:38.275 --> 00:15:41.775
'Because Russians are doing experiments in para-psychology

00:15:41.817 --> 00:15:44.899
and we want to do the same'.

00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:48.775
I said they will all get possessed and they will finish off.

00:15:48.775 --> 00:15:52.066
I do not want to do the same thing as Russians are doing.

00:15:52.108 --> 00:15:54.191
If they come to me I will tell them the same thing.

00:15:54.191 --> 00:15:56.525
So they said, 'No, no we must learn.'

00:15:56.525 --> 00:16:00.108
I said if I tell you that you become slaves of those spirits

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:05.233
and of your own and you start shaking your body all the time.

00:16:05.275 --> 00:16:07.775
Despite that they said 'yes, we must do it'.

00:16:07.775 --> 00:16:12.609
And when they told me that because Russians are doing it,

00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:15.150
we want to do it, I said who sent you here ?

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:17.692
So they told me the name of a gentleman,

00:16:17.734 --> 00:16:21.817
who is a journalist in Bombay. I said this fellow

00:16:21.859 --> 00:16:25.734
used to 'suffer' from this trouble. He used to leave his body,

00:16:25.775 --> 00:16:30.066
go into another world, see this and see that, who suffered so much

00:16:30.066 --> 00:16:35.817
and he was losing complete control over himself, and I 'cured' him.

00:16:35.859 --> 00:16:39.358
So does he think I can put back the disease in you ?

00:16:39.358 --> 00:16:42.275
I cured him of this disease and

00:16:42.275 --> 00:16:44.275
why do you want to get into this disease?

00:16:44.275 --> 00:16:47.734
But they were quite sure that they wanted it

00:16:47.775 --> 00:16:50.817
and I discovered later on they are having

00:16:50.859 --> 00:16:53.899
parapsychological business in America

00:16:53.899 --> 00:16:57.275
which is an 'extremely' dangerous thing.

00:16:57.317 --> 00:17:02.483
So this is the movement not crossing the Agnya but moving,

00:17:02.483 --> 00:17:04.609
floating on the left or the right,

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:05.983
whether you go to subconscious

00:17:05.983 --> 00:17:08.692
or to the supraconscious. Effects may be different

00:17:08.734 --> 00:17:11.983
but is the same thing to Sahaja Yoga. The people who go

00:17:12.025 --> 00:17:17.066
to the subconscious area may start seeing me also in different forms,

00:17:17.108 --> 00:17:21.275
like the people who take LSD they cannot see me,

00:17:21.317 --> 00:17:24.734
they just see lights coming out of me. And those who go

00:17:24.734 --> 00:17:28.941
to the subconscious area they start seeing forms

00:17:28.983 --> 00:17:36.650
and things in such a manner that they think, they have reached heavens.

00:17:36.692 --> 00:17:40.483
But they are seeing past of evolution, past of everything.

00:17:40.483 --> 00:17:44.650
So this supraconscious business, is very dangerous,

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:48.025
no doubt, but also the subconscious is very dangerous.

00:17:48.066 --> 00:17:51.899
Because all incurable diseases like cancer, malaitis,

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:55.275
all that come from the movement of the attention to the left side.

00:17:55.317 --> 00:18:01.817
So one should be very careful before going

00:18:01.817 --> 00:18:04.150
to any one of these tantrikas.

00:18:04.191 --> 00:18:09.483
Or to these people who are trying to control you

00:18:09.525 --> 00:18:12.609
or trying to tell you something about the future or the past.

00:18:12.609 --> 00:18:17.734
There is no need to know about the future or the past.

00:18:17.734 --> 00:18:22.734
What is the need ? How does it help? Actually if I start telling you

00:18:22.734 --> 00:18:25.275
how I came all the way from there

00:18:25.317 --> 00:18:30.734
and how I was held by the jam or anything, will you be interested?

00:18:30.775 --> 00:18:39.233
How do you get interested in your past glory or past life,

00:18:39.233 --> 00:18:44.525
which was of no value at all, today ? But it is a human weakness

00:18:44.567 --> 00:18:49.859
that he wants to add to his personality something

00:18:49.899 --> 00:18:57.983
that is extremely artificial, non-existent, and of no value.

00:18:58.025 --> 00:19:04.358
And then he says that I did this, I did this, I happened to do this,

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:09.775
I never got it. In India people normally go more

00:19:09.817 --> 00:19:15.650
to the left side with this Agnya. Because they say, worship God.

00:19:15.692 --> 00:19:21.066
Now if they have to worship God, they have no connection with God.

00:19:21.108 --> 00:19:22.817
See I had no connection to microphone,

00:19:22.817 --> 00:19:28.400
I could not speak to you. So without connection to God,

00:19:28.442 --> 00:19:32.066
they start worshipping God. Then they will sing all kinds of Aartis,

00:19:32.108 --> 00:19:35.899
fasting, this, torturing their own lives. This is left sided people.

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:40.483
And singing the praise, all these things. Going to the extremes,

00:19:40.483 --> 00:19:46.317
24 hours they are like that. So somebody sucks them

00:19:46.358 --> 00:19:51.442
into the left side. If they go on saying, Rama Rama Rama............ like that.

00:19:51.483 --> 00:19:55.150
You might say that Valmiki was told to say.

00:19:55.191 --> 00:20:01.650
But who told him? It was Narada. Narada is an incarnation, Narada.

00:20:01.692 --> 00:20:03.899
You are not Narada. So

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:05.025
how can you tell yourself

00:20:05.066 --> 00:20:07.317
or anybody can tell you, take this name ?

00:20:07.358 --> 00:20:10.983
You take any name, you cannot go to God.

00:20:11.025 --> 00:20:14.066
So where do you go? You go somewhere.

00:20:14.066 --> 00:20:18.275
There may be a servant called Rama, he might capture you.

00:20:18.317 --> 00:20:21.900
And people start behaving in such a funny manner

00:20:21.941 --> 00:20:25.483
that they look like mad, insipid people.

00:20:25.483 --> 00:20:29.150
Same thing about supraconscious.

00:20:29.191 --> 00:20:35.108
People who are very ambitious, they too can get

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:38.483
into such a mad condition where they do not think

00:20:38.525 --> 00:20:44.442
of the collectivity of the whole, but they just start thinking

00:20:44.442 --> 00:20:48.317
about themselves. And when such a situation comes in,

00:20:48.317 --> 00:20:53.525
it is impossible to convince them that they are wrong till they reach

00:20:53.567 --> 00:20:56.108
their waterloo and finish off.

00:20:56.150 --> 00:21:03.025
So this Agnya Chakra is a gate, is the door of heaven.

00:21:03.066 --> 00:21:10.191
and everyone has to pass through it. Now on this Chakra

00:21:10.233 --> 00:21:16.983
resides the great incarnation of our Lord, Jesus Christ.

00:21:16.983 --> 00:21:21.567
In our Indian Shastras, he is called as Mahavishnu,

00:21:21.609 --> 00:21:31.983
the son of Radhaji. And His essences are made of eleven Rudras,

00:21:31.983 --> 00:21:33.900
means eleven destroying powers.

00:21:33.941 --> 00:21:38.108
But the governing essence the main essence,

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:40.899
is that of Shri Ganesha means innocence.

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:44.734
So he is the embodiment of innocence.

00:21:44.734 --> 00:21:49.233
Innocence means complete purity.

00:21:49.275 --> 00:21:54.108
And His body was not made out of Mother Earth,

00:21:54.150 --> 00:22:01.317
in the sense that He never had a body that was perishable.

00:22:01.358 --> 00:22:06.817
It is Aumkara. So when He died, He ascended.

00:22:06.817 --> 00:22:08.859
That is the fact, He ascended.

00:22:08.859 --> 00:22:13.983
And because He was a person made of Aumkara.

00:22:13.983 --> 00:22:18.066
Now as He is the son of Radhaji,

00:22:18.108 --> 00:22:20.483
you can see the relationship between Him

00:22:20.525 --> 00:22:27.859
and the relationship between other deities very easily.

00:22:27.859 --> 00:22:36.317
About Mahavishnu, it is written in the Devi Bhagvat.

00:22:36.358 --> 00:22:41.900
But who reads Devi Bhagvat? Nobody has time to read these books.

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:44.525
Mostly what trash things they read,

00:22:44.525 --> 00:22:49.108
there you cannot find explanation of all these incarnations

00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:53.025
who have come on this earth. So to understand Jesus Christ,

00:22:53.066 --> 00:22:57.191
you must read Devi Bhagvat. But if you say this to Christians,

00:22:57.233 --> 00:23:00.400
they would not like to listen to you. Because for them,

00:23:00.442 --> 00:23:03.317
Bible is the last word. How can it be?

00:23:03.358 --> 00:23:05.899
Because Christ's life is depicted there

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:07.609
only for four years.

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:11.442
And He must have reference in other books also;

00:23:11.483 --> 00:23:13.817
and we have to open our eyes to those books

00:23:13.859 --> 00:23:16.358
and see for ourselves what is the truth.

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:20.734
Because if we want to have an organised religion,

00:23:20.775 --> 00:23:24.442
you have to say 'this is the thing,' there is nothing else.

00:23:24.442 --> 00:23:28.899
Because if there is anything else, then your organisation falls apart.

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:35.191
But it is not true. Because Christ has been described 'very clearly'

00:23:35.233 --> 00:23:39.692
in Devi Bhagvat. And we can prove it in the Kundalini,

00:23:39.692 --> 00:23:44.734
that when the Kundalini rises and stops here, at the Agnya,

00:23:44.775 --> 00:23:48.609
here, you have to say Lord's prayer, otherwise. It would not open.

00:23:48.609 --> 00:23:51.150
To awaken Jesus Christ, if you do not awaken Him,

00:23:51.150 --> 00:23:53.233
it would not open. You have to take His name

00:23:53.275 --> 00:23:56.899
otherwise it would not open, proves it was Christ who was ruling.

00:23:56.899 --> 00:24:00.066
Or even if you take the name of Mahavishnu, it opens.

00:24:00.066 --> 00:24:03.609
So Mahavishnu and Jesus Christ are the same.

00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:09.859
So you must see the 'proof' of it. And just because you want to believe

00:24:09.899 --> 00:24:14.233
that Christ is your own and discard everybody else as heathens,

00:24:14.275 --> 00:24:18.692
you are sadly mistaken. Absolutely you are sadly mistaken.

00:24:18.692 --> 00:24:23.567
In every scripture people have entered from the back door.

00:24:23.609 --> 00:24:27.191
Every, scripture. I told you about Gita,

00:24:27.233 --> 00:24:30.108
what wrong things they have written about the food

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:33.609
which is scientifically not true. To say that Tamogunis

00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:36.400
are the people who eat meat, is not true,

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:37.775
because they eat protein

00:24:37.817 --> 00:24:40.400
and they have to be Rajogunis, automatically.

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.609
So how they have tried to change it,

00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:45.734
just to suit their thing at that part. But in the beginning

00:24:45.734 --> 00:24:48.983
they could not, because they said, Krishna said that

00:24:48.983 --> 00:24:51.650
''You kill these people. I have already killed them.

00:24:51.692 --> 00:24:54.941
Whom are you killing?' So just to bring this, you see.

00:24:54.941 --> 00:25:02.108
Brahmanic stamp, they did this. In the Bible the mistake came

00:25:02.108 --> 00:25:04.734
when Saint Paul, who never knew Christ --

00:25:04.775 --> 00:25:09.108
he had nothing to do with Christ - just entered into the Bible.

00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:12.191
I don't know, why he is there ! He was not a realised soul.

00:25:12.233 --> 00:25:15.358
He was just supraconscious Roman soldier.

00:25:15.358 --> 00:25:19.483
Roman, very bad soldier, who used to kill so many Christians.

00:25:19.525 --> 00:25:22.900
And suddenly they entered this Mr. Saint Paul into it

00:25:22.941 --> 00:25:25.734
and he is accepted in the Bible all over the world.

00:25:25.775 --> 00:25:29.066
But you read him and you will know he is not a realised soul at all.

00:25:29.108 --> 00:25:31.275
He talks in a supraconscious way.

00:25:31.317 --> 00:25:34.859
He is an organising machine and he is good for nothing.

00:25:34.899 --> 00:25:39.650
There he describes, in the acts you see, which he has written --

00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:42.775
many people may not be knowing that acts has been written

00:25:42.817 --> 00:25:47.233
by Mr. Paul himself - and this Mr. Paul tries to describe

00:25:47.233 --> 00:25:50.734
the disciples of Christ as supraconscious bhoots,

00:25:50.775 --> 00:25:54.650
absolutely like supraconscious people and they behaved

00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:57.400
in such a funny manner that everybody started feeling

00:25:57.442 --> 00:26:00.483
that they are mad. Can you imagine, Christ's disciples

00:26:00.525 --> 00:26:04.358
behaving like that ! But you have to gulp it down

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:09.191
and devour everything, if you are a Christian. Because it is in the Bible.

00:26:09.191 --> 00:26:12.483
And you start questioning if you are a born-realised person,

00:26:12.525 --> 00:26:14.358
that what is this non-sense,

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:16.358
who is this Mr. Paul ? From where does he come in ?

00:26:16.358 --> 00:26:23.567
Because he does not talk like Christ. So the time has come for all of us

00:26:23.609 --> 00:26:29.400
to understand that all religions are one.

00:26:29.442 --> 00:26:33.734
They are part and parcel of one life stream

00:26:33.775 --> 00:26:37.317
and that all incarnations are supporting each other,

00:26:37.317 --> 00:26:39.650
nourishing each other and caring for each other.

00:26:39.692 --> 00:26:43.941
There is 'complete' concord between them. There is 'no way',

00:26:43.941 --> 00:26:47.983
you will see they will oppose each other, 'never'.

00:26:47.983 --> 00:26:52.817
So this point is to be proved also and that can be only proved

00:26:52.859 --> 00:26:56.817
'if' you know how to raise the Kundalini.

00:26:56.859 --> 00:27:00.025
If you are a realised soul and if you can raise the Kundalini

00:27:00.025 --> 00:27:03.191
you will be amazed to see that all these deities are placed

00:27:03.191 --> 00:27:05.817
on various Chakras and they are to be raised.

00:27:05.859 --> 00:27:10.025
Now sometimes you see, I am blamed in India

00:27:10.066 --> 00:27:13.775
that I am preaching about Christ, so I am spreading Christianity,

00:27:13.817 --> 00:27:17.400
and if I go to England, they say I am preaching about Krishna,

00:27:17.442 --> 00:27:20.983
so I am spreading Hinduism. Now if I have to tell you

00:27:20.983 --> 00:27:25.650
that Radhaji has created Christ and if you see Christ,

00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:29.400
his fingers are like this.'' Try to understand.

00:27:29.442 --> 00:27:33.233
Two fingers like this. One of Krishna and one of Vishnu.

00:27:33.275 --> 00:27:39.567
And he says 'the Father'. And who is the Father of Christ, then ?

00:27:39.567 --> 00:27:42.817
Is Shri Vishnu: Shri Krishna.

00:27:42.817 --> 00:27:44.983
Because in Mahavishnu's description,

00:27:45.025 --> 00:27:51.483
it is, Shri Krishna Himself worshipped His son and said

00:27:51.483 --> 00:27:54.817
''you will be the support of the Universe,

00:27:54.859 --> 00:28:00.692
and whosoever will ever worship me, the fruits of that will go to you,''

00:28:00.734 --> 00:28:03.941
and He placed Him even higher than Himself.

00:28:03.983 --> 00:28:06.650
And that you can see that above the Vishuddhi Chakra,

00:28:06.692 --> 00:28:11.442
stands Mahavishnu. And He is the gate through which

00:28:11.483 --> 00:28:16.108
everybody has to pass. He 'actually' blessed Him special

00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:21.025
and He said ''you will be the support of the universe.''

00:28:21.025 --> 00:28:25.275
See now you have known that Shri Ganesha stays

00:28:25.317 --> 00:28:28.859
at Mooladhara Chakra. Mooladhara Chakra means

00:28:28.899 --> 00:28:33.567
the support of the Moola, support of the roots.

00:28:33.609 --> 00:28:37.650
But Christ is placed at the support of the fruit.

00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:40.859
So the same thing evolves at that point,

00:28:40.899 --> 00:28:48.400
that you become aware of Christ only when your Agnya Chakra opens.

00:28:48.442 --> 00:28:54.483
Now this Agnya Chakra can be opened when the Kundalini goes up

00:28:54.525 --> 00:28:59.025
and opens it up. But supposing if you are too much ego oriented,

00:28:59.025 --> 00:29:03.233
then you have turned it so tight say,

00:29:03.275 --> 00:29:07.609
the two ropes have turned it so tight that nothing can pass through.

00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:12.066
Or if you are too much of a superego and a frightened personality

00:29:12.066 --> 00:29:16.650
and dominated one, then also it is twisted so badly

00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:20.066
that Agnya Chakra cannot open up.

00:29:20.066 --> 00:29:24.650
So what we have to do, is to give a balance through the Agnya Chakra

00:29:24.692 --> 00:29:27.983
by moving left to the right or right to the left

00:29:28.025 --> 00:29:30.400
according to the need, which you will understand

00:29:30.442 --> 00:29:33.734
in the technique of Sahaja Yoga -- after realisation, not now.

00:29:33.775 --> 00:29:38.275
Now when the balance is established

00:29:38.317 --> 00:29:45.150
then the Chakras, the Agnya Chakra becomes

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:49.275
little also better off, because there is no twist on it.

00:29:49.317 --> 00:29:54.275
And then only, when the Kundalini rises, She can push through.

00:29:54.317 --> 00:30:00.150
If you are normal person, if you are not a ego

00:30:00.191 --> 00:30:05.483
and superego type, then there is no problem

00:30:05.483 --> 00:30:07.817
to raise your Kundalini through your Agnya.

00:30:07.859 --> 00:30:10.650
But say in Delhi, since I have come,

00:30:10.692 --> 00:30:14.650
I have been working on the Agnya morning till evening.

00:30:14.692 --> 00:30:16.899
People are 'extremely' ego oriented.

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:20.400
They all think that they are the administrator of the whole World.

00:30:20.442 --> 00:30:22.317
Delhi is full of this Agnya.

00:30:22.358 --> 00:30:26.900
Such proud and such vain people are here that they always think

00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:28.899
that they are ruling the whole World.

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:31.650
They are the people who are the administrators

00:30:31.650 --> 00:30:36.358
and the great people belonging to politics, this that.

00:30:36.358 --> 00:30:39.650
All ego oriented. And such people

00:30:39.692 --> 00:30:42.108
cannot be given realisation easily ;

00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:44.066
first their ego has to be brought down

00:30:44.108 --> 00:30:50.983
and they have to accept God as the Supreme Being, as the Lord,

00:30:51.025 --> 00:30:55.692
as the Real King of the World. Then only it works out.

00:30:55.734 --> 00:31:03.775
Now when some people also try to spoil this Agnya

00:31:03.817 --> 00:31:07.900
like moving the eyes, the roving eyes.

00:31:07.941 --> 00:31:11.734
Christ imagine ! --specially mentioned that

00:31:11.734 --> 00:31:14.859
''They say 'thou shall not commit adultery;'

00:31:14.899 --> 00:31:20.609
I say thou shall not have adulterous eyes'' Just imagine!

00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:25.275
He talked of the eyes. Because He is controlling the eyes at that point.

00:31:25.317 --> 00:31:30.150
But in the West, it is hard to find any man or a woman

00:31:30.191 --> 00:31:32.066
who does not have adulterous eyes,

00:31:32.108 --> 00:31:36.525
those who are the followers of Christ have such horrible eyes

00:31:36.567 --> 00:31:39.066
that you don't know what they are doing, they will go mad.

00:31:39.108 --> 00:31:41.525
They cannot keep their eyes straight.

00:31:41.525 --> 00:31:44.025
All the times their eyes turning, this side that side,

00:31:44.025 --> 00:31:47.817
this side, that side. They have lusty eyes

00:31:47.817 --> 00:31:50.817
or they are looking at things or something else,

00:31:50.859 --> 00:31:54.817
but it is all joyless there is no joy !

00:31:54.859 --> 00:32:00.400
They are just looking at people for no fun at all.

00:33:27.358 --> 00:33:30.275
So Christ has said : ''Thou shall not have adulterous eyes.''

00:33:30.275 --> 00:33:37.317
But this was all said as an order by Christ.

00:33:37.358 --> 00:33:41.899
Of course nobody obeyed it. On the contrary like I told you

00:33:41.899 --> 00:33:44.317
the Muslims were, it was said not to drink,

00:33:44.358 --> 00:33:47.108
they started having poems written by Umar Khayaam

00:33:47.108 --> 00:33:50.442
to challenge Mohammad Sahib. But among Christians

00:33:50.483 --> 00:33:56.150
they started challenging Christ, all anti-Christ activities,

00:33:56.191 --> 00:33:59.899
by which innocence of the people should be destroyed,

00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:07.650
by which their eyes would be destroyed and all the purity of mind will be destroyed.

00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:12.900
And the another extreme started, which was 'not at all'

00:34:12.941 --> 00:34:16.899
preached by Christ-I don't know how it came into Christian religion --

00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:24.150
is a thing called nunnery and making people Brahmacharinis

00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:27.525
and Brahmacharis. You cannot make anyone Brahmachari

00:34:27.525 --> 00:34:30.692
or Brahmacharini. It is a state-avastha (),

00:34:30.692 --> 00:34:35.609
where a person has to rise, like Yogeshwara, like Shri Krishna.

00:34:35.650 --> 00:34:38.025
Despite all that he was a Brahmachari.

00:34:38.317 --> 00:34:40.859
It is a state of mind where you are not involved.

00:34:40.899 --> 00:34:44.066
It is a different thing, that you just load somebody

00:34:44.108 --> 00:34:46.650
with an idea that You should become,

00:34:46.692 --> 00:34:49.650
absolutely a Brahmachari or a Brahmacharini

00:34:49.650 --> 00:34:53.025
or you should lead a celibate life, forcing them.

00:34:53.066 --> 00:34:58.442
Christ never said so. He could not become a married man

00:34:58.483 --> 00:35:03.650
because He was here on this earth to do one great job,

00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:08.150
'is to make this ascent through this Agnya Chakra,'

00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:13.567
that is why He was crucified. By doing this

00:35:13.609 --> 00:35:18.025
he was to create a space in the Agnya Chakra

00:35:18.066 --> 00:35:22.483
and that is what He did, at the command of His Father and His Mother.

00:35:22.483 --> 00:35:26.400
And He did it. So the people who are doing

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:30.233
all this non-sense of celibacy - which is not.

00:35:30.275 --> 00:35:33.941
Which is not, because from the mind there is no celibacy.

00:35:33.983 --> 00:35:38.609
Celibacy must come from within, the purity must come from within.

00:35:38.609 --> 00:35:42.150
And that has created problem in Catholicism

00:35:42.191 --> 00:35:47.483
and also they started another big stuff like going

00:35:47.525 --> 00:35:51.817
and confessing to the priest. Now this is also another funny thing

00:35:51.859 --> 00:35:56.983
is to go to a priest. Priest is never a realised soul I have seen it.

00:35:57.025 --> 00:35:59.900
Because if he is a realised soul he will run away from priesthood.

00:35:59.941 --> 00:36:03.899
So they would go and confess it to the priest

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:06.650
and the poor priest would become mad

00:36:06.692 --> 00:36:11.483
and the confessor would have a left-Vishuddhi, feeling the guilt.

00:36:11.525 --> 00:36:15.817
That was the wrong side absolutely of God.

00:36:15.859 --> 00:36:19.817
To feel guilty is not necessary. Then, after Christ

00:36:19.817 --> 00:36:23.899
there were people who would not accept Christ, like Jews.

00:36:23.899 --> 00:36:28.734
So they said that we will not accept Christ and 'we must suffer

00:36:28.775 --> 00:36:30.983
because we must suffer for God.' Even now

00:36:31.025 --> 00:36:34.066
Christians believe nonsensically that we should suffer.

00:36:34.108 --> 00:36:39.775
Now, I would say Indians also believe that we have to suffer,

00:36:39.817 --> 00:36:42.899
but they also know that Mahavishnu is going to come

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:48.066
and when He comes, He will have power to suck our Karmas

00:36:48.108 --> 00:36:51.358
and we don't have to suffer. Actually that is what happens

00:36:51.358 --> 00:36:54.525
when Christ is awakened within you, He sucks your Karmas,

00:36:54.567 --> 00:36:58.650
he sucks your ego and super ego. He sucks your Karmas,

00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:00.609
your papas (sins), your conditioning

00:37:00.609 --> 00:37:02.567
and that is how you become free.

00:37:02.609 --> 00:37:05.066
This is a very important point which people must know.

00:37:05.108 --> 00:37:08.650
That, that was the great job He did: was to establish Himself

00:37:08.650 --> 00:37:12.275
at the Agnya Chakra to suck these two things.

00:37:12.317 --> 00:37:17.692
And when He sucks these two, when He sucks these,

00:37:17.734 --> 00:37:22.941
then we are above our Karmas, our sins and our papas.

00:37:22.941 --> 00:37:26.775
So we don't have to worry about sins, papas and all that.

00:37:26.775 --> 00:37:30.899
But these people we should say, those who came to this earth,

00:37:30.899 --> 00:37:36.150
as missionaries, who came down to India to preach Christianity,

00:37:36.191 --> 00:37:39.775
had no idea of Mahavishnu nor they had any idea of Christ.

00:37:39.775 --> 00:37:42.900
They came with a gun in one hand and Bible in the other.

00:37:42.941 --> 00:37:47.899
And we stupid Indians also did not know any value of our heritage,

00:37:47.899 --> 00:37:51.400
and we just said 'all right, let us become Christians so that

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:53.609
they give us good jobs.'

00:37:53.650 --> 00:37:55.692
And that is how all the job oriented,

00:37:55.734 --> 00:37:57.817
all sorts of people became Christians.

00:37:57.859 --> 00:38:02.233
But actually, they should have told that Mahavishnu is born.

00:38:02.233 --> 00:38:06.817
If they had read anything of the Devi Bhagvat

00:38:06.859 --> 00:38:10.233
and had told that Mahavishnu is born,

00:38:10.275 --> 00:38:13.233
then people would have given up this idea

00:38:13.275 --> 00:38:15.400
that you have to suffer for your Karmas.

00:38:15.442 --> 00:38:20.442
So Indians are still thinking that we have to still suffer for our Karmas,

00:38:20.483 --> 00:38:26.859
we should fast, we should walk and we should hang ourselves

00:38:26.899 --> 00:38:30.983
by the nearest tree all the time. This is not needed.

00:38:30.983 --> 00:38:34.066
What you have to do, is to just wait for the moment

00:38:34.066 --> 00:38:36.941
when the Agnya Chakra will be opened. Keep in the center.

00:38:36.941 --> 00:38:41.899
As Buddha has said keep in the center.

00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:46.400
And then when the KundaIini rises all this whatever is accumulated,

00:38:46.442 --> 00:38:49.108
will be sucked in and you can get your Moksha.

00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:51.650
This was the simple thing to be done. Instead of that

00:38:51.692 --> 00:38:54.567
we Indians believe we must suffer, we must go into fast.

00:38:54.567 --> 00:38:57.900
Now in Sahaja Yoga you are not allowed to fast in the name of God.

00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:00.483
You may fast otherwise because if you have no money you can fast,

00:39:00.483 --> 00:39:06.275
you have to fast in any case. But not in the name of God

00:39:06.317 --> 00:39:09.317
or your Karmas. Then secondly,

00:39:09.317 --> 00:39:11.817
the Jews refused to accept Christ,

00:39:11.817 --> 00:39:18.150
as a result the Jews said that : we are not going to accept Christ,

00:39:18.191 --> 00:39:22.567
we have to suffer. So, alright, they suffered and suffered and suffered.

00:39:22.609 --> 00:39:26.400
So they got Mr. Hitler to put them right; their sufferings.

00:39:26.442 --> 00:39:28.692
After getting Mr. Hitler, now they are

00:39:28.734 --> 00:39:30.567
becoming Hitlers. So you can imagine

00:39:30.567 --> 00:39:34.859
how wrong ideas can take you to such a limit,

00:39:34.899 --> 00:39:38.859
that as a result of this thing, 'that we have to suffer';

00:39:38.899 --> 00:39:46.983
that Hitler was born to support their wishes that they must suffer.

00:39:46.983 --> 00:39:52.775
Nobody has to suffer any more now.

00:39:52.775 --> 00:39:58.859
You have to work-out your KundaIini awakening.

00:39:58.899 --> 00:40:04.400
And you have to establish yourself very well in Sahaja Yoga.

00:40:04.442 --> 00:40:09.983
All your sufferings are going to be taken away.

00:40:10.025 --> 00:40:14.609
One of the names of the Devi is Papa Vimochini.

00:40:14.650 --> 00:40:19.609
She removes all your papas. ''Sankat Vimochan''

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:22.233
we call it 'Shri Ganesha'. He is the One

00:40:22.275 --> 00:40:25.859
who removes all the hurdles of life. And you really,

00:40:25.859 --> 00:40:31.358
when blessed, you can see that God has so many ways

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:38.191
of blessing the people. It is miraculous. Absolutely it is a miracle.

00:40:38.191 --> 00:40:42.025
So many people who are in Sahaja Yoga now,

00:40:42.066 --> 00:40:47.025
say that miracle has lost its meaning in Sahaja Yoga.

00:40:47.025 --> 00:40:49.108
It is a fact.

00:40:49.108 --> 00:40:55.066
So, one has to understand that God exists. Not only He exists.

00:40:55.108 --> 00:41:03.609
He acts. He loves, and that we are supposed to know Him.

00:41:03.609 --> 00:41:07.900
Whatever you may have done, wherever may be the mistakes,

00:41:07.941 --> 00:41:13.358
you have to become One with God.

00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:16.983
Because He is your loving Father.

00:41:17.025 --> 00:41:20.442
He is the Father who is the Ocean of love.

00:41:20.483 --> 00:41:25.817
And only thing you have to do, is to just ask for it

00:41:25.859 --> 00:41:30.025
and when the Kundalini rises you become One with Him

00:41:30.025 --> 00:41:33.442
and He wants to bestow all His Kingdom,

00:41:33.483 --> 00:41:39.609
all His powers upon His children, whom He has created.

00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:44.066
So all these funny ideas about religion that you have to suffer,

00:41:44.108 --> 00:41:47.817
that you must do penance, that you should become Brahmacharis --

00:41:47.817 --> 00:41:50.941
all these absurd ideas, should be given up.

00:41:50.941 --> 00:41:54.983
You have to be absolutely a normal happy person.

00:41:55.025 --> 00:41:59.650
God has done so much for you He has created so much for you.

00:41:59.692 --> 00:42:02.941
But even then if you want to be miserable, what can one do ?

00:42:02.941 --> 00:42:08.650
As far as Mother is concerned

00:42:08.692 --> 00:42:10.483
if you want to punish your Mother sometimes,

00:42:10.525 --> 00:42:14.650
or say, you want to just make her unhappy, then you say; '...

00:42:14.692 --> 00:42:16.358
otherwise I will not eat my food'.

00:42:16.358 --> 00:42:19.525
So fasting is not allowed in Sahaja Yoga.

00:42:19.567 --> 00:42:23.817
But if you have to fast for food, other things, it is all right.

00:42:23.817 --> 00:42:26.817
But otherwise there is no need to fast except for one or two days,

00:42:26.859 --> 00:42:32.358
you have to fast. And thus we understand that Agnya Chakra

00:42:32.358 --> 00:42:37.400
which is the most important door through which

00:42:37.442 --> 00:42:41.358
'everybody' has to pass, everybody has to pass,

00:42:41.358 --> 00:42:49.025
and that has to be properly worshipped and kept clean.

00:42:49.066 --> 00:42:56.442
For that You must keep your attention very clean. Your attention has to be clean.

00:42:56.483 --> 00:43:02.066
If your attention is soiled then your Agnya Chakra will not be alright.

00:43:02.066 --> 00:43:05.358
Then you will have hallucinations, you will have wrong ideas

00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:07.525
and you will think of wrong things.

00:43:07.567 --> 00:43:11.899
So if you really want to find the meaning of your being,

00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:14.692
if you really want awakening of the Kundalini,

00:43:14.692 --> 00:43:18.817
then know that whatever you have known so far about God

00:43:18.859 --> 00:43:23.941
or everything has to be revised, has to be again seen for yourself,

00:43:23.941 --> 00:43:27.150
what it is like. Unless and until you pass through this

00:43:27.191 --> 00:43:30.483
you 'cannot' be baptised.

00:43:30.525 --> 00:43:35.150
The people who talk of Baptism, like John the Baptist,

00:43:35.191 --> 00:43:39.317
he was really a realised soul and when he raised the Kundalini

00:43:39.358 --> 00:43:43.358
and put the water on the head, he really gave them realisation.

00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:47.609
That is 'baptism'. Christian means a baptised person,

00:43:47.609 --> 00:43:50.734
but not any Dick, Tom and Harry can put his hand on your head

00:43:50.734 --> 00:43:53.650
and say you are realised. On the contrary William Blake says,

00:43:53.650 --> 00:43:57.775
'the priest cursed on my head.' It is true.

00:43:57.775 --> 00:44:00.525
For a realised soul, if you put the hand of a priest

00:44:00.567 --> 00:44:05.983
who is not a realised soul and who is not properly entitled to do it,

00:44:06.025 --> 00:44:08.025
children get into problems.

00:44:08.025 --> 00:44:09.899
We have seen many children who are realised souls,

00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:13.692
who got into problems -- their eyes became squinty,

00:44:13.734 --> 00:44:16.317
they become funny, their brains went off and we have to cure them.

00:44:16.358 --> 00:44:18.859
So it is a very dangerous thing to make everyone

00:44:18.859 --> 00:44:24.442
put their hands on this pulsating fontanelle bone area

00:44:24.483 --> 00:44:27.317
which we call as Taloo. Taloo is the Brahmarandhra,

00:44:27.358 --> 00:44:30.567
and is the 'most' important part of a human being,

00:44:30.609 --> 00:44:34.734
so everybody should be 'very' careful before they touch this.

00:44:34.734 --> 00:44:37.983
You have to be a realised soul and you have to know how to do it,

00:44:37.983 --> 00:44:40.233
means you have to be a Sahaja Yogi.

00:44:40.233 --> 00:44:43.275
So for your children when they are born you have to be careful.

00:44:43.275 --> 00:44:45.734
If they are realised soul; more so.

00:44:45.775 --> 00:44:48.400
Because if they are not realised souls,

00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:51.400
then their reaction is not so violent. But if they are realised soul,

00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:55.066
they scream and shout and they cannot bear it.

00:44:55.066 --> 00:44:58.775
So one must understand, though it looks like very traditional

00:44:58.817 --> 00:45:03.275
or anything like that, one must see that those things

00:45:03.317 --> 00:45:05.900
which are harmful to human beings must be given up.

00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:09.483
The time has come for all of us to give up those things

00:45:09.525 --> 00:45:12.108
which are not good for our health,

00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:16.859
which are not good for our spiritual being. The time has come.

00:45:16.859 --> 00:45:21.442
If you do not accept this, then only thing I can say as a Mother

00:45:21.483 --> 00:45:23.567
that 'I am concerned about you'. But it is much more than that.

00:45:23.567 --> 00:45:27.899
It is a dangerous time you are in.

00:45:27.899 --> 00:45:31.358
And Agnya Chakra, if it is spoilt at the back,

00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:35.609
that means you are definitely possessed.

00:45:35.650 --> 00:45:39.066
At the back if the Agnya Chakra is caught

00:45:39.108 --> 00:45:43.442
then one develops blindness with the eyes open.

00:45:43.483 --> 00:45:46.317
Now, in India it is very common. The reason is

00:45:46.358 --> 00:45:50.734
we have very funny ideas about the Devi or the God

00:45:50.775 --> 00:45:53.483
coming into the body of human beings. How can that be ?

00:45:53.525 --> 00:45:55.900
It is again the same thing, supraconscious business.

00:45:55.900 --> 00:46:01.734
A maid servant who is all the time using bad words,

00:46:01.734 --> 00:46:06.692
who has no sense of cleanliness, who has no sense of holiness,

00:46:06.692 --> 00:46:10.483
suddenly becomes agitated, ''Ho Ho Ho...'' she goes on.

00:46:10.525 --> 00:46:13.483
And all the women, in Maharashtra it is very common,

00:46:13.525 --> 00:46:16.233
they will go and fall at her feet. 'The Devi has come,

00:46:16.233 --> 00:46:19.191
the Devi has come' and now they fall at her feet.

00:46:19.191 --> 00:46:22.150
And then ultimately they are caught up.

00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:26.983
Because they get the possession by a spirit.

00:46:26.983 --> 00:46:30.358
We had one very bad case recently where a man,

00:46:30.358 --> 00:46:33.817
he came to me and he told me that he cannot help,

00:46:33.817 --> 00:46:35.941
he has to touch the feet of his sister-in-law

00:46:35.983 --> 00:46:38.150
because she is a Devi. I said why ?

00:46:38.191 --> 00:46:41.066
'Because she gets into this agitation.' So I told

00:46:41.108 --> 00:46:44.899
that if you think that she is a Devi and if you want to touch her feet

00:46:44.900 --> 00:46:48.317
you don't come to me again. But he became blind,

00:46:48.358 --> 00:46:51.899
absolutely blind ! And when he became 'absolutely' blind

00:46:51.899 --> 00:46:56.191
then he came to me and then we had to put the Agnya Chakra alright.

00:46:56.191 --> 00:46:57.899
Now how do you do it in Sahaja Yoga.

00:46:57.900 --> 00:47:01.983
As you have the photograph you may use it.

00:47:02.025 --> 00:47:03.900
Put a light before the photograph.

00:47:03.941 --> 00:47:06.191
Light is the way you cure your Agnya Chakra.

00:47:06.191 --> 00:47:10.567
Always. Light or the sun. Because Christ resides in the sun.

00:47:10.567 --> 00:47:14.233
So what you do, is to put a light in front.

00:47:14.275 --> 00:47:20.358
Take another light behind and give an Aarti to your Agnya Chakra

00:47:20.358 --> 00:47:29.150
at the back. It is resided by Maha Ganapati and Maha Bhairava.

00:47:29.191 --> 00:47:33.983
So you just give it an Aarti and Agnya Chakra will open.

00:47:34.025 --> 00:47:38.025
But how do you open this ? Very simple thing is that,

00:47:38.025 --> 00:47:40.650
any thought comes to you, you should say 'I forgive'.

00:47:40.650 --> 00:47:43.692
This is the greatest weapon Christ has given us.

00:47:43.734 --> 00:47:45.734
You just say 'I forgive, I forgive',

00:47:45.775 --> 00:47:48.108
and you can overcome your ego.

00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:51.400
This is the mantra for this Chakra in the front,

00:47:51.442 --> 00:47:54.400
where you just say 'I forgive, I forgive, I forgive'

00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:56.899
and you will find your Agnya Chakra will open out

00:47:56.899 --> 00:48:00.108
and you will find your ego will go away.

00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:03.025
Forgiveness is one of the 'biggest' weapons human beings have got.

00:48:03.066 --> 00:48:05.983
But they are so stupid if I tell them 'Forgive.

00:48:06.025 --> 00:48:08.358
Now what is there not to forgive ?'

00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:10.233
They say it is very difficult to forgive.

00:48:10.275 --> 00:48:12.900
I say what is so difficult ? What are you doing ?

00:48:12.941 --> 00:48:15.150
Are you doing something when you are saying,

00:48:15.150 --> 00:48:17.817
I am forgiving. Do you do something ? Nothing.

00:48:17.859 --> 00:48:19.817
On the contrary when you do not forgive,

00:48:19.817 --> 00:48:24.400
then what is happening is, the person whom you do not forgive,

00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:28.442
is actually torturing you, while you are not torturing that person.

00:48:28.483 --> 00:48:33.233
So this is the mantra of the Agnya Chakra in front,

00:48:33.233 --> 00:48:36.650
and at the back, as I told you, you have to move the Light.

00:48:36.692 --> 00:48:39.191
Now somebody will, you see, one day they will do,

00:48:39.233 --> 00:48:42.358
two days they will do, - that is not how the Sahaja yoga is to be worked out.

00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:44.983
You have to really go all out to do it,

00:48:45.025 --> 00:48:47.983
and I have seen people who had eyes which were all bent like this,

00:48:47.983 --> 00:48:50.400
they could never raise their eyes, are now,

00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:53.859
have open eyes, proper eyes with this working.

00:48:53.899 --> 00:48:56.066
It is 'very' simple to be done.

00:48:56.108 --> 00:48:58.567
There is one more thing that happens to our eyes.

00:48:58.567 --> 00:49:02.692
When the Swadishthana Chakra goes out of order.

00:49:02.692 --> 00:49:05.692
It is represented here at the back,

00:49:05.734 --> 00:49:09.692
which is 'around' this back Agnya.

00:49:09.734 --> 00:49:12.567
So when you have diabetes or anything like that,

00:49:12.567 --> 00:49:17.191
people start becoming blind. Because this Swadishthana Chakra

00:49:17.191 --> 00:49:21.108
which is around, goes on pressing it and that is how,

00:49:21.150 --> 00:49:29.400
that part which is surrounding this center, oppresses

00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:36.150
and augments that centre, so that the eyes cannot see;

00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:39.400
there is no light. There is darkness and people have eyes open.

00:49:39.442 --> 00:49:43.066
You have seen many diabetic people get this blindness.

00:49:43.108 --> 00:49:48.650
So first of all cure your diabetes through curing your Swadishthana.

00:49:48.692 --> 00:50:00.317
And also you can use an ice around your Swadishthana at the back.

00:50:00.317 --> 00:50:04.191
But first of all if you improve your Swadishthana

00:50:04.191 --> 00:50:06.191
you will feel very much better.

00:50:06.233 --> 00:50:12.108
So the treatment of the front side is with the light.

00:50:12.150 --> 00:50:17.108
And the treatment of the back is with the water.

00:50:17.108 --> 00:50:21.983
But the best is also to use the light or the water

00:50:22.025 --> 00:50:24.775
whichever way you like. Because if it is Swadishthana

00:50:24.775 --> 00:50:29.567
you have to use the water but if it is 'just' the possession,

00:50:29.567 --> 00:50:33.358
then you have to use - without diabetes, if it is a possession --

00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:35.567
then you have to just use the light.

00:50:35.567 --> 00:50:39.358
That is how we cure our Agnya Chakra.

00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:46.400
Even Christ said I am the Light, I am the PATH.

00:50:46.442 --> 00:50:49.941
Because He is the Aumkara. He is the path. And He is the door,

00:50:49.983 --> 00:50:53.400
He is the gate. And everybody will have to pass through His gate.

00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:57.941
He never told lies. But they crucified him. They just crucified him.

00:50:57.983 --> 00:51:00.442
One thing good we have,

00:51:00.483 --> 00:51:02.775
we are fortunate in this country, we don't have

00:51:02.817 --> 00:51:05.609
any organised religion. Thank your stars for that.

00:51:05.609 --> 00:51:07.983
If you had any organised religion,

00:51:08.025 --> 00:51:10.191
you could never have taken to Sahaja Yoga.

00:51:10.191 --> 00:51:13.233
Because according to organised religion you have to believe

00:51:13.275 --> 00:51:17.400
in one person and as if he has no connection with anyone,

00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:19.734
he is a lone person hanging in the air,

00:51:19.775 --> 00:51:23.900
he has nothing to do anybody else. So 'thank' God for this

00:51:23.941 --> 00:51:26.941
that it has not happened in this country.

00:51:26.983 --> 00:51:31.191
And that is how we have people who are more suited for Sahaja Yoga

00:51:31.191 --> 00:51:35.150
than we have in 'any' other country because they are so conditioned.

00:51:35.191 --> 00:51:38.900
And it is a very great blessing. For example now,

00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:43.483
Sai Nath who was the last incarnation of the Guru Principle.

00:51:43.525 --> 00:51:48.108
He was a Muslim. But all His disciples are Hindus.

00:51:48.108 --> 00:51:51.734
They are not Muslims. Muslims don't accept him even as God.

00:51:51.775 --> 00:51:55.066
Not only that, but there is one place called Hazimallang,

00:51:55.108 --> 00:51:58.609
where a Saint died who was a Muslim.

00:51:58.650 --> 00:52:04.692
But he told that 'only the Brahmins, means the realised souls,

00:52:04.692 --> 00:52:08.358
must worship me.' And so they had to appoint some Brahmin --

00:52:08.358 --> 00:52:10.442
which they did not understand - the word 'Brahmins.'

00:52:10.442 --> 00:52:14.317
They are Hindus who are worshipping a Muslim peer.

00:52:14.358 --> 00:52:19.525
So the idea, that once you become the peer,

00:52:19.525 --> 00:52:27.275
once you become a realised soul, then he has no religion.

00:52:27.317 --> 00:52:30.400
He is beyond religion, He 'becomes' the religion.

00:52:30.442 --> 00:52:32.442
Then there is no binding for him,

00:52:32.483 --> 00:52:35.358
because a drop has gone to the ocean.

00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:37.275
Now he has become the ocean.

00:52:37.317 --> 00:52:39.899
So for the ocean, there is no limitation.

00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:42.066
And because he has crossed his limitations,

00:52:42.108 --> 00:52:46.025
he is 'above' all these things. And that is what we believe in.

00:52:46.066 --> 00:52:48.275
That if he is a peer. If he is a realised soul,

00:52:48.317 --> 00:52:49.859
then he is a realised soul.

00:52:49.899 --> 00:52:57.275
Once I went to a small village, called Mian Ki Takdi ()

00:52:57.317 --> 00:53:01.525
as soon as I stepped into the village, I felt 'tremendous' vibrations.

00:53:01.525 --> 00:53:04.150
And I said "Who was the great saint who lived here?'

00:53:04.191 --> 00:53:06.066
So they said there was one Muslim peer ().

00:53:06.066 --> 00:53:08.650
I said 'Whatever it is, he was a Saint'. And when I was sitting

00:53:08.650 --> 00:53:10.650
and giving lecture, you will see the photographs,

00:53:10.650 --> 00:53:13.817
the lights came on my head seven times. And the seventh time

00:53:13.817 --> 00:53:17.567
then I put my hand like this. But nobody saw it, only I knew.

00:53:17.567 --> 00:53:20.817
And I knew that it was there, I was laughing with it.

00:53:20.859 --> 00:53:25.150
And then the people, you see, when they took the photographs, they could picture it.

00:53:25.191 --> 00:53:27.650
So these realised souls are all over

00:53:27.650 --> 00:53:31.525
and they are helping. They never enter into anybody,

00:53:31.525 --> 00:53:34.734
they never trouble you, they guide you, to the proper lines.

00:53:34.734 --> 00:53:38.983
They bring their Angels and they help you to come to the right path,

00:53:39.025 --> 00:53:42.609
to the right conclusions. And they never try to possess you,

00:53:42.650 --> 00:53:46.900
they never try to hypnotise you, or take you to the wrong side of life.

00:53:46.941 --> 00:53:50.775
So when you are realised also, you must know

00:53:50.817 --> 00:53:54.900
that you have to know 'completely' what is the reality.

00:53:54.941 --> 00:54:01.358
Go on understanding, trying to assimilate it, not to discard it

00:54:01.358 --> 00:54:04.859
because you are attached to another organisation.

00:54:04.899 --> 00:54:08.066
There is 'no' organisation in Sahaja Yoga. you know very well.

00:54:08.066 --> 00:54:10.191
There is no grouping in Sahaja Yoga.

00:54:10.191 --> 00:54:12.442
There is no membership in Sahaja Yoga.

00:54:12.483 --> 00:54:19.066
'But' it is a living organisation. It is a living organisation.

00:54:19.108 --> 00:54:21.899
So anything happens here, the whole body knows.

00:54:21.941 --> 00:54:25.941
We don't have to have organisation written for this body.

00:54:25.941 --> 00:54:30.108
In the same way Sahaja Yoga works out.

00:54:30.150 --> 00:54:33.108
But still I must say, as we have in our body

00:54:33.150 --> 00:54:37.317
different type of sensory system, we too have in Sahaja Yoga,

00:54:37.317 --> 00:54:40.400
people who just come in, just the beginners.

00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:44.734
They are not exposed to the truths which they cannot bear.

00:54:44.775 --> 00:54:48.775
Then if they pass a certain line of understanding

00:54:48.817 --> 00:54:53.275
then they are taken as we say Nirvichar-Samadhi people,

00:54:53.317 --> 00:54:57.025
who are given certain facilities to enter

00:54:57.066 --> 00:55:00.983
into certain new dimensions and ideas.

00:55:01.025 --> 00:55:05.191
But the inner circle people are the ones who are in Nirvikalpa.

00:55:05.233 --> 00:55:10.900
Such people are only taken into consideration

00:55:10.900 --> 00:55:16.108
for teaching Sahaja Yoga. Anybody who tries to teach Sahaja Yoga,

00:55:16.108 --> 00:55:20.400
talk about Sahaja Yoga at the second stage just is thrown out,

00:55:20.442 --> 00:55:24.734
because there is a centrifugal and a centripetal, both the forces working.

00:55:24.734 --> 00:55:29.150
By one you come in and by another you are thrown like a tangent.

00:55:29.150 --> 00:55:32.650
Nobody is anxious to have a very big group or anything.

00:55:32.692 --> 00:55:36.941
If it is big, well and good, one wants to save as many as possible.

00:55:36.941 --> 00:55:40.400
But nobody is going to force you, nobody is going to have

00:55:40.442 --> 00:55:43.442
any cheap sort of a circus for it.

00:55:43.442 --> 00:55:46.650
It is the desire of the people, who want to come in.

00:55:46.692 --> 00:55:49.525
It is the wish of the people, those who have to come,

00:55:49.525 --> 00:55:50.983
you cannot force them.

00:55:51.025 --> 00:55:54.191
You cannot force a person to get their realisation.

00:55:54.233 --> 00:55:57.900
So this is what is today at the Agnya Chakra, I have told you.

00:55:57.900 --> 00:56:01.358
Agnya Chakra I have spoken many a times in England

00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:07.233
and in America and was very much sometimes "opposed"

00:56:07.275 --> 00:56:09.233
by some churches and things.

00:56:09.275 --> 00:56:13.066
But I think if they want to exist any longer,

00:56:13.066 --> 00:56:16.525
they 'better' take to truth and 'know'

00:56:16.567 --> 00:56:19.817
that what they know so far is incomplete.

00:56:19.817 --> 00:56:24.525
They have to know the full of it. Because Christ could not talk much

00:56:24.567 --> 00:56:28.442
and whatever He said was written down by His disciples

00:56:28.442 --> 00:56:30.567
the way they understood. To understand Christ

00:56:30.609 --> 00:56:32.650
you have to have your realisation.

00:56:32.650 --> 00:56:36.734
May God bless you.

00:56:37.025 --> 00:56:42.191
If you have any cuestion you can ask me again for a while

00:56:42.233 --> 00:56:47.275
and then I'll make a move because today I have been unusualy late

00:56:47.317 --> 00:56:50.734
but it happens you have to get out of time

00:56:50.775 --> 00:56:52.650
you have to get in tu timelesnes,

00:56:52.692 --> 00:56:55.108
you have to be decontioned about time

00:56:55.150 --> 00:56:57.066
those who see time too much ,

00:56:57.108 --> 00:56:59.275
have to learn to get out of time

00:56:59.317 --> 00:57:03.108
and this is very very important, because time is according

00:57:03.108 --> 00:57:06.900
to ceartin auspiciousness has to be work out.

00:57:06.941 --> 00:57:10.775
It has not to be work out the way we think that this is the time

00:57:10.775 --> 00:57:13.025
and I can not be the slaves of watches

00:57:13.066 --> 00:57:15.066
I have another wathch on my own

00:57:15.108 --> 00:57:17.899
