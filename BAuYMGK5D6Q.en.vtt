[Music]

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:30.460
but how do we become the Guru that is

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:33.940
very important for sahaja Yogi's to

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:37.000
understand many have felt that they are

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:40.360
gurus they have tried to behave in a

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:46.269
funny manner and have lost their boo

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:49.390
position first and foremost thing for

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:54.899
sahaja Yogi's it is important that they

00:00:49.390 --> 00:01:03.219
must have introspection they was foster

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:06.520
if a person runs about changing because

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:10.200
a fashion has come because people have

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:18.869
suppressed them or have asked them just

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:24.659
to please people of cheap values if a

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:29.290
person changes then he cannot be a guru

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:34.860
he has to station its himself properly

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:39.070
on the values of sahaja yoga without

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:42.390
introspection you will not know you will

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:47.710
never remember what you have done wrong

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:52.750
nor will you think of what you have to

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:57.700
do right but that is only possible if

00:01:52.750 --> 00:02:06.780
you go on improving yourself when you

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:11.380
are climbing on it into the new part of

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:17.620
righteousness of goodness of compassion

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:22.260
and love you should see yourself watch

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:24.630
yourself what are you doing

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:30.520
where are you going

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:35.200
how far you are stupid you should not

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:44.740
cheat your hair this is the first step

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:52.260
is of introspection now what helps for

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:52.260
this introspection is your sense of love

00:02:52.770 --> 00:03:05.830
can you love a person who is distressful

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:11.920
one who is aggressive one who is

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:18.459
hot-tempered one who cheats you can you

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:21.850
love such a person you can then how can

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:25.750
you love yourself when you have these

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:30.570
qualities when you do this to yourself

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:35.590
so the first thing is the pure love for

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:41.790
yourself if you love yourself you don't

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:46.450
want anything because you enjoy yourself

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:49.930
to enjoy yourself is the greatest

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:54.480
enjoyment so this is the beginning of

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:59.200
your self-realization when you realize

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:03.220
how important is yourself you don't have

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:07.000
wrong ideas about it you don't justify

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:14.280
all the wrong thing you do because you

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:19.919
understand that is a blemish on yourself

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:24.040
fix yourself in the most honest manner

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:29.470
and you'll be amazed to see how nice it

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:34.890
is just to see the pure self shining

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:37.260
within you when that cell starts shining

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:43.040
you start seeing many

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:49.710
things which you have not seen so and

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:55.740
one of them you see is that love is not

00:04:49.710 --> 00:05:02.940
only for yourself but for everyone it's

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:06.950
a pure love for everyone else it's not

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:12.240
only for yourself it's very surprising

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:20.330
when you really love yourself then your

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:20.330
love is for yourself and you start

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:32.580
spreading that love in such a manner

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:37.550
that you dutifully love others you don't

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:45.260
love for money you don't love for some

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:52.140
advantage for some power or for some

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:54.530
gain but you love for love because pure

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:58.740
love is so joy-giving

00:05:54.530 --> 00:06:08.630
so from now we go to other point which

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:11.400
is purity and the purity is a subject

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:15.870
which has been talked about by many

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:23.010
people that you should be pure you

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:27.900
should behave absolutely open and people

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:32.460
should know everything about you I don't

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:37.650
think that is purity purity is that

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:42.890
which purifies others if you are a pure

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:46.030
person then others should be purified

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:48.580
purity is very pardon

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:52.120
it may not act on one or two questions

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:57.390
don't matter there could be some very

00:06:52.120 --> 00:07:02.920
very nasty horrible fellows Bernard but

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:08.100
it would have an effect or very many

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:17.310
sensitive persons who want to become

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:21.430
sahaja Yogi's you have to just test it

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:25.810
how people likes you and how they are

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:31.030
impressed by the paramchaitanya is all

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:37.240
pervading power of divine love flows

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:42.880
through you because of you if you are

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:48.790
impure then it will stop at different

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:53.800
chakras it won't work so purity of

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:58.110
temperament purity of love what does

00:07:53.800 --> 00:08:06.730
that mean that you love somebody because

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:09.840
that person has got spirituality you

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:17.680
love that person because there is purity

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:26.010
so the character of a yogi is to worship

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:26.010
the purity of your own and the purity of

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:34.630
it is true that we have to face

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:40.060
ourselves every day it's true we have to

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:41.860
correct ourself every day it's true but

00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:45.760
we have to separate ourselves from

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:49.990
ourselves to see how far we have done

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:56.240
how far we have gone what are we doing

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:59.560
what have we done so you

00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:05.480
call yourselves as gurus if you want I

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:10.730
did not say that you are a guru but you

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:15.649
have to first of all makes yourself your

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:25.880
device must look after yourself first

00:09:15.649 --> 00:09:31.420
you have to see for yourself have I got

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:35.660
the qualities am I the one who can

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:38.570
really do all this all this

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:44.740
introspection within you should be with

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:44.740
a very clean heart and understanding

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:54.860
because you are not incarnations which

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:57.770
are born accessible but you are human

00:09:54.860 --> 00:10:02.870
beings and you are rising to the level

00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:07.550
of those incarnations so you have to

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:11.899
cleanse you have to watch yourself see

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:16.160
for yourself and then understand if you

00:10:11.899 --> 00:10:21.980
are a sahaja yogi have you got the

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:25.490
beauty of purity and try to balance

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:28.850
yourself try to watch yourself and guide

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:36.709
yourself and tell yourself become your

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:41.440
own gurus judge yourself how far you are

00:10:36.709 --> 00:10:44.390
in the center how far you are growing

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:47.149
how much growth have you achieved

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:51.760
are you still attached to small things

00:10:47.149 --> 00:10:55.190
here and there this is to be realized

00:10:51.760 --> 00:11:00.250
not to be put in the mind but to be

00:10:55.190 --> 00:11:06.020
realized in the heart in the realm of

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:07.750
your heart you have to realize it you

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:15.150
have to understand it

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:15.150
in the realm of your heart negative

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:47.339
[Music]

00:11:45.279 --> 00:11:47.339
you
