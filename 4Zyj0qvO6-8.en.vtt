00:08.595 --> 00:12.475
The other method we employ is of puja.

00:12.960 --> 00:16.355
I’ve found that works very well with human beings – puja –

00:16.845 --> 00:24.165
because it satisfies lots of demands of the past habits

00:25.405 --> 00:29.675
that you feel that you are doing something about it.

00:30.230 --> 00:39.090
Then you start giving whatever you think God has given you – the blessings.

00:39.515 --> 00:41.620
And the Rishi and Muni have found out

00:41.840 --> 00:44.130
they’re very clever people

00:44.575 --> 00:48.555
they have found out how to please the Deities

00:48.600 --> 00:50.301
how to please the Mother.

00:50.705 --> 00:51.780
So they have told you

00:51.885 --> 00:55.975
as they have told you even in this lifetime of mine

00:56.165 --> 00:57.875
how to please Her.

00:57.950 --> 00:59.870
They say She is Stutipriya

01:00.015 --> 01:01.870
that means ‘She likes praises’.

01:01.950 --> 01:02.945
It’s not that.

01:03.130 --> 01:08.620
But when you praise someone from the heart

01:08.740 --> 01:12.105
that means you are accepting it

01:12.660 --> 01:20.035
and that is the time the chakras start creating a force by which you are thrown

01:20.245 --> 01:27.350
you are triggered, into that realm of God.

01:28.235 --> 01:34.575
So these puja methods and prayer methods and the mantra methods

01:34.960 --> 01:40.270
have been devised and found out by great thinkers of Sahaja Yoga

01:40.645 --> 01:43.535
the great masters of Sahaja Yoga.

01:43.775 --> 01:48.035
And it is the effort

01:48.115 --> 01:51.020
or you can say the effortless effort

01:51.325 --> 01:59.960
of the Sahaja yogis that makes my body vibrate

02:00.410 --> 02:05.250
extracts the essence from my body, I should say.

02:05.500 --> 02:11.280
They make, it makes, the Infinite release Itself through this finite being.

02:12.205 --> 02:15.860
And it works, it clicks, I have seen it, it works out very well.

02:16.110 --> 02:17.635
But you know that, after puja

02:17.630 --> 02:20.660
I get little tired

02:20.690 --> 02:25.075
because, if you cannot receive it, that Force

02:25.480 --> 02:27.100
I want to sleep

02:27.165 --> 02:40.200
and get rid of that additional vibrations into “sushupti” [deep sleep] by entering into the Infinite State.

02:40.715 --> 02:43.695
If you could receive whatever I am emitting

02:44.070 --> 02:48.015
in balance, with your puja

02:48.860 --> 02:52.215
then only it helps better.

02:52.900 --> 02:57.280
That means, when you are doing puja also, receive it.

02:57.800 --> 03:00.645
Be in thoughtless awareness when you are doing puja

03:00.940 --> 03:05.320
completely concentrated in receiving.

03:05.485 --> 03:08.270
But while [doing] puja people are talking.

03:08.520 --> 03:12.245
I’ve seen that they’re moving about. I mean, I don’t know how to explain it!

03:12.665 --> 03:15.665
That’s the time something is oozing out, the nectar

03:16.005 --> 03:19.600
and you just receive it at that time with full devotion.

03:19.730 --> 03:21.235
It is oozing out.

03:21.285 --> 03:24.625
If you feel my vibrations of my chakras at that time

03:24.635 --> 03:26.135
you will realise

03:26.415 --> 03:29.325
that even the minute, small little

03:29.600 --> 03:33.935
wheels in my body are moving at different spaces

03:34.445 --> 03:37.525
at different speed

03:37.805 --> 03:41.115
at different dimension.

03:41.485 --> 03:45.665
And I really don’t know how to explain! But, you see, it creates a melody.

03:46.555 --> 03:52.060
You have to receive it and it is a melody individually

03:52.755 --> 03:55.595
suitable for every individual.

03:56.180 --> 03:58.915
And when you receive it

03:59.630 --> 04:04.310
it triggers in you that state of infinity.

04:05.215 --> 04:07.690
So at the time of puja

04:07.870 --> 04:14.950
you must know that all your attention should be in reception.
