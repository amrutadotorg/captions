Her Holiness Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi
Pune (Shere) Puja Talk, India

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:10.700
December 3, 1990

00:03:32.244 --> 00:03:39.244
[Marathi]

00:04:08.796 --> 00:04:15.796
So, welcome to all the Sahaja Yogis from abroad.

00:04:23.156 --> 00:04:30.156
So we start from today our Maharashtra Tour

00:04:34.234 --> 00:04:40.776
which you can see is full of these hills and dales.

00:04:43.426 --> 00:04:53.163
Also, the atmosphere is going to be extremely rustic.

00:04:55.272 --> 00:05:03.580
Of course, the comforts of this place have not been up to the mark,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.575
 but next year it will be much better, I'm sure.

00:05:10.621 --> 00:05:13.731
We have decided to purchase even this plot of land,

00:05:13.859 --> 00:05:19.684
but as you know we have a land on top, there on the hill - the top.

00:05:20.436 --> 00:05:26.079
That's one of the highest peaks in this area.

00:05:26.541 --> 00:05:31.134
 That land we have already purchased,
and we are going to have an Ashram there,

00:05:31.303 --> 00:05:34.795
 and this would be the place used for [parking ?].

00:05:37.641 --> 00:05:40.966
I hope you like the atmosphere here

00:05:41.687 --> 00:05:45.182
and the surroundings, the nature.

00:06:02.595 --> 00:06:07.163
People in Maharashtra are blessed by great saints

00:06:07.433 --> 00:06:11.700
 and people who were Naths, like Gyaneshwara.

00:06:12.262 --> 00:06:19.969
And that's why they have a tremendous base of spirituality.

00:06:20.317 --> 00:06:27.317
But still they are to be guided to get their Realization.

00:06:33.209 --> 00:06:38.768
As you know that without spirituality,

00:06:38.977 --> 00:06:43.377
the life is very much in - is in imbalance.

00:06:43.786 --> 00:06:50.786
It does not have the totality of enjoyment.

00:06:51.138 --> 00:06:54.356
I don't know if there is any enjoyment otherwise also.

00:06:54.501 --> 00:07:04.455
Because if you just live with your machineries and materialism,

00:07:05.129 --> 00:07:07.407
 they cannot give you joy.

00:07:09.714 --> 00:07:15.799
And that's what you have discovered, the emptiness of life.

00:07:16.538 --> 00:07:20.503
And that's the reason you want spirituality,

00:07:21.238 --> 00:07:29.822
to give a complete expression to your personality -

00:07:31.064 --> 00:07:34.099
which has happened. Luckily it has happened.

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:40.285
I'm very happy to see so many people who have felt it.

00:07:40.857 --> 00:07:45.800
And this is what has to be understood by Indians also,

00:07:46.078 --> 00:07:50.909
 because they think that you people are so well off materially.

00:07:53.028 --> 00:07:59.139
And while they are not - they are spiritually well-off and you are materially well-off.

00:07:59.425 --> 00:08:02.337
 And both the things are so important.

00:08:02.512 --> 00:08:06.464
The foundation has to be strong, of spirituality,

00:08:06.641 --> 00:08:10.821
 and then you can build whatever type of building you want to build on top of that.

00:08:11.012 --> 00:08:15.530
But if you do not have that foundation, then the whole thing collapses.

00:08:15.777 --> 00:08:21.492
Like a tree grows, and it doesn't touch the source

00:08:22.829 --> 00:08:26.256
 of its nourishment, it will definitely collapse.

00:08:26.441 --> 00:08:33.842
This is what Sahaja Yoga is, that you are touching the source of your nourishment,

00:08:34.081 --> 00:08:37.242
nourishment to your civilization.

00:08:37.567 --> 00:08:42.005
And once this nourishment starts flowing, you see

00:08:42.109 --> 00:08:51.138
what's wrong in those countries where people have gone headlong,

00:08:51.499 --> 00:08:56.930
 gone to the extremes, and what they are suffering.

00:08:57.484 --> 00:09:00.643
The people here have no idea about it.

00:09:01.055 --> 00:09:04.571
Also in this country of ours we have lots of

00:09:04.798 --> 00:09:11.798
problems because people are so simple, very vulnerable.

00:09:14.281 --> 00:09:18.720
But dealing with the problems of the West,

00:09:19.109 --> 00:09:22.632
 I feel that there's no way out but Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:27.773
As many as we can save, we should try to save them.

00:09:28.856 --> 00:09:37.362
 Whatever may be the achievements in the West
they are going to boomerang,

00:09:38.164 --> 00:09:43.376
and they may destroy the whole society.

00:09:46.839 --> 00:09:52.658
So, when you are starting the first day here

00:09:52.912 --> 00:10:00.113
you should ask for spirituality, the blessings of spirituality,

00:10:00.945 --> 00:10:09.459
 but also the promise that you will help others who are getting drowned

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:13.640
into the dry materialism of the West.

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:16.584
That's a very important task you have to do.

00:10:16.721 --> 00:10:24.444
You are all enjoying this beautiful life, and you are at peace with yourself,

00:10:25.298 --> 00:10:34.175
but this wine of spirituality has to be shared,

00:10:34.556 --> 00:10:41.414
otherwise life becomes very selfish, self-centered.

00:10:41.618 --> 00:10:48.269
I know you are frightened of those people,
because you think you may catch from them.

00:10:48.514 --> 00:10:55.514
In this tour I hope most of you will be made badha-proof

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:09.658
and fearless. As I told you, you have to touch your depth.

00:11:10.262 --> 00:11:13.535
If you live with superficiality,

00:11:13.814 --> 00:11:19.526
any superficiality in you must be thrown away, then you will sink down.

00:11:20.534 --> 00:11:23.244
There are all kinds of superficialities

00:11:23.387 --> 00:11:27.623
which have come to us as a "blessing" of this Western civilization,

00:11:27.692 --> 00:11:32.014
as also in India we have another. But as I'm talking to you

00:11:32.342 --> 00:11:39.092
 I'll - I would like to tell you about the superficialities 
that we have in the West.

00:11:39.328 --> 00:11:43.822
First of all, the another style is our norms and ideas.

00:11:43.854 --> 00:11:46.401
Actually it's all a mental activity,

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:53.490
as I've told you that the whole art of the West is finished.

00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:58.274
We cannot have Rembrandt any more.
 We cannot have Michelangelo any more.

00:11:58.425 --> 00:12:03.515
 The reason is, criticism of this art

00:12:04.005 --> 00:12:07.822
has been so much in the modern times that nobody wants to produce anything

00:12:07.943 --> 00:12:12.416
 which will be criticized, and now only situation left is

00:12:12.527 --> 00:12:16.392
that critics are criticizing critics, that's all. No art -

00:12:16.541 --> 00:12:19.019
 because they have no work to do.

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:24.615
So this mental activity of putting everybody down

00:12:25.241 --> 00:12:33.355
and mastering that art, is very dangerous and extremely destructive.

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:44.031
 And this is what is happening I feel, 
in the field of every kind of activity:

00:12:45.715 --> 00:12:53.265
 industry, music, art, everything

00:12:53.993 --> 00:13:02.561
that you find; buildings, any enterprise, even politics.

00:13:02.945 --> 00:13:06.665
 Everything has become so superficial

00:13:07.187 --> 00:13:13.749
that you have to be prepared for facing

00:13:13.901 --> 00:13:18.477
all kinds of oppositions and troubles.

00:13:19.547 --> 00:13:24.509
 But still, as you have your own depth, you can master them all

00:13:25.319 --> 00:13:29.904
by your tranquility, by your temperament,

00:13:30.094 --> 00:13:38.141
and by your powers which you have got. 
When you are not afraid of that society,

00:13:38.374 --> 00:13:42.782
and when you have that tranquility within you

00:13:43.028 --> 00:13:48.184
and the courage, I'm sure you can do a lot.

00:13:48.695 --> 00:13:51.824
Of course we have some very dynamic people

00:13:51.968 --> 00:13:56.189
 in Sahaja Yoga in the West, and very dynamic women also in the West.

00:13:56.406 --> 00:13:59.080
What may come they never deter.

00:13:59.215 --> 00:14:04.159
And they have worked very hard to do everything possible

00:14:04.461 --> 00:14:07.452
to see that Sahaja Yoga is established.

00:14:07.667 --> 00:14:10.520
So they should be your ideals,

00:14:10.615 --> 00:14:16.301
 and all of you should try to follow them and do the best.

00:14:17.324 --> 00:14:20.577
This tour is a festival for us.

00:14:20.792 --> 00:14:25.977
It's, of course I say it's a pilgrimage but there are no

00:14:26.453 --> 00:14:31.810
 signs of pilgrimage it looks. Because if you see the pilgrims,

00:14:32.189 --> 00:14:37.276
horrible they look, while you are looking like roses, all of you.

00:14:37.507 --> 00:14:42.017
So it's a festival for us and you have to feel that

00:14:42.173 --> 00:14:45.368
festivity within your heart,

00:14:46.096 --> 00:14:52.768
that joy within your heart, and small, small things you should not worry,

00:14:53.755 --> 00:14:59.496
 because these things cannot be provided in all the places.

00:14:59.956 --> 00:15:04.019
 Gradually we'll be building ashrams in all the places

00:15:04.107 --> 00:15:08.412
wherever you have been visiting, but you know how difficult it is,

00:15:08.681 --> 00:15:14.339
 in those days where the India is passing through such a bad phase

00:15:14.495 --> 00:15:21.495
for so many years, where everything is delayed.

00:15:23.356 --> 00:15:29.219
So the attitude should be that: "We have come here for our ascent."

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:34.289
We have to work out everything with that attitude,

00:15:34.384 --> 00:15:36.800
that we have come here for our ascent,

00:15:36.904 --> 00:15:41.924
and every moment of our ascent is a festive occasion.

00:15:42.036 --> 00:15:44.229
Everything is a festival.

00:15:44.621 --> 00:15:50.570
 If you understand that,
 I am sure you will see the beauty in everything,

00:15:50.813 --> 00:15:54.868
 you will enjoy everything, whatever may be the rustic style.

00:15:54.955 --> 00:15:58.609
Maybe you may not like the color of these lights, I think, because

00:15:58.693 --> 00:16:03.064
you may not enjoy it so much. 
You might get much better things in your own country.

00:16:03.286 --> 00:16:06.262
But whatever it is,

00:16:06.627 --> 00:16:11.639
 it's not your conditioning that should stop you from enjoying.

00:16:11.909 --> 00:16:16.157
 So please remember that you are now

00:16:16.609 --> 00:16:21.697
 the member of the Universal Society,

00:16:21.857 --> 00:16:28.790
and we cannot have our conditionings to mar our happiness and joy.

00:16:28.989 --> 00:16:33.981
I want you to enjoy this trip fully, absolutely -

00:16:34.188 --> 00:16:37.817
in a way that you have never enjoyed anything before.

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:40.618
May God bless you!

00:16:54.164 --> 01:30:10.370
