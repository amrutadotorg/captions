1
00:00:47,087 --> 00:00:50,865
[A little child calls loudly:
“Mataji! Jai!”.]

2
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:05,563
Today's puja we have arranged of Durga
or the Kali.

3
00:01:05,936 --> 00:01:14,911
That is the destroying form of the Goddess
of all the evil and negativity.

4
00:01:15,112 --> 00:01:19,329
This we had to do it in France,

5
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:27,738
because I feel very strongly that day
by day, in general,

6
00:01:27,939 --> 00:01:32,795
France is going down and down and down.

7
00:01:32,996 --> 00:01:35,283
While you people are coming up,

8
00:01:35,484 --> 00:01:40,646
the rest of the France is in the most
pitiable condition.

9
00:01:40,847 --> 00:01:46,788
Firstly, as you understand, is the Catholic
church,

10
00:01:46,989 --> 00:01:52,174
which - perhaps you are not aware of,
perhaps maybe -

11
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:57,664
because you don't read any other languages,

12
00:01:57,865 --> 00:02:03,614
you just read French compulsorily
by this country.

13
00:02:03,815 --> 00:02:11,106
So you have no international views
or international news

14
00:02:11,307 --> 00:02:19,639
that this Catholic church has done
so many horrible things in the past,

15
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,569
that is unbelievable that they have
anything to do with God.

16
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:35,802
They burnt many cardinals in the hearth -
roasted them.

17
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:42,720
Not only that, they killed so many people

18
00:02:42,921 --> 00:02:46,870
who ever tried to utter a word about them.

19
00:02:47,071 --> 00:02:51,730
They were much worse than Muslim people.

20
00:02:52,023 --> 00:02:56,886
They went to other countries like South
America, America -

21
00:02:57,087 --> 00:03:04,451
all these places they're all Catholics -
even our country.

22
00:03:04,665 --> 00:03:12,657
And they killed millions and millions
of people.

23
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:20,323
Now as this is Kruta Yuga that has started,

24
00:03:20,524 --> 00:03:23,670
one of the things as I said yesterday
is that:

25
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:28,245
you will have to pay for whatever you
have done,

26
00:03:28,446 --> 00:03:32,846
on mass scale or individual scale.

27
00:03:35,418 --> 00:03:38,604
If that is the case,

28
00:03:38,805 --> 00:03:42,990
then one must know that France has to pay
a lot

29
00:03:43,191 --> 00:03:48,704
and this Catholic church has to pay more.

30
00:03:49,776 --> 00:03:54,374
Catholic church has just taken out yarns
out of their heads

31
00:03:54,575 --> 00:03:59,573
and started a theory of original sin.

32
00:03:59,774 --> 00:04:04,847
That's how to condemn every other
Incarnation, every other Prophet -

33
00:04:05,048 --> 00:04:07,556
that they were all with original sin.

34
00:04:07,757 --> 00:04:10,789
And even they said Mary was born with
original sin,

35
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:15,337
for many popes they were discussing it.

36
00:04:17,171 --> 00:04:23,208
This shows that this whole hocus-pocus
religion of Catholic church

37
00:04:23,409 --> 00:04:30,166
had to establish itself by forcing people,
by torturing them,

38
00:04:30,367 --> 00:04:37,694
by taking all their ideas into their
own control,

39
00:04:37,895 --> 00:04:43,131
give them funny ideas like original sin.

40
00:04:43,332 --> 00:04:50,508
Another is that you must confess, giving
them the left Vishuddhis.

41
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:56,035
They treated women as nothing

42
00:04:56,236 --> 00:05:00,368
and to Mother of Mary they called Her
a woman.

43
00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:04,221
And this Paul, as I told you yesterday,
is a fact.

44
00:05:04,435 --> 00:05:08,454
Now it's necessary for Sahaja Yogis
to understand

45
00:05:08,655 --> 00:05:17,512
how this Catholic church is so dangerous
and has been doing such harm.

46
00:05:17,713 --> 00:05:22,357
As there has been so many books about it -

47
00:05:22,558 --> 00:05:28,220
that you people don't read, because
it's not in French.

48
00:05:28,713 --> 00:05:34,710
There are English books from America -
you must learn English.

49
00:05:34,911 --> 00:05:38,769
It's very important now I feel, that
all the French must know English,

50
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,853
they must read English.

51
00:05:42,054 --> 00:05:46,994
French will not give you the international
personality

52
00:05:47,195 --> 00:05:51,031
that you are supposed to acquire.

53
00:05:51,245 --> 00:05:54,933
You had some scholarship, not much.

54
00:05:55,134 --> 00:05:58,468
The real scholarship comes from England

55
00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:06,421
and also from America in English language,
and also from India.

56
00:06:06,622 --> 00:06:11,957
One gentleman who tried to translate
all these things in UNESCO,

57
00:06:12,158 --> 00:06:15,613
he was thrown out by your media.

58
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:20,794
Your media is taking full advantage that
you don't read any other newspapers;

59
00:06:20,995 --> 00:06:24,353
they are doing whatever they feel like.

60
00:06:24,554 --> 00:06:31,994
All kinds of scandals, all kinds
of sensationalization -

61
00:06:32,195 --> 00:06:36,132
whatever they want to write, they write
in free press.

62
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:41,616
On one side there's suppression of natural
life of human beings,

63
00:06:41,817 --> 00:06:44,991
let them to go to Freud.

64
00:06:45,192 --> 00:06:48,694
When Freud is the dirtiest man you
could think of,

65
00:06:48,895 --> 00:06:52,062
who has put his ideas into your head.

66
00:06:52,263 --> 00:06:59,017
But as if you are already brainwashed
people that you accepted all that.

67
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:03,257
How could you accept Freud? If Freud
had come to India,

68
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:06,363
they would have killed him in no time!

69
00:07:06,564 --> 00:07:10,450
What happens is that, somehow or other -
I don't know what is the reason,

70
00:07:10,651 --> 00:07:15,055
I don't know where to place it, but
the wisdom is not there.

71
00:07:15,256 --> 00:07:18,861
There is no maturity, there is no wisdom.

72
00:07:19,062 --> 00:07:23,678
America I can understand because it is only
two-three hundred years old.

73
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:27,901
But what about the French? They have
not been able

74
00:07:28,102 --> 00:07:32,946
to mature but they have become extremely
frivolous.

75
00:07:33,147 --> 00:07:36,449
Maturity is finished.

76
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:43,401
One of the reasons could be that they want
that you should be always young.

77
00:07:43,602 --> 00:07:49,974
In India, young people are called
as stupid:

78
00:07:51,078 --> 00:07:56,543
you call it gadha pachisi, means
at twenty-five years they are donkeys.

79
00:07:56,744 --> 00:08:02,591
They are never regarded as sensible people
to be followed.

80
00:08:03,186 --> 00:08:10,419
And gradually by this movement from
Catholic church to Freud,

81
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:14,347
what has happened that you haven't got
your own personality

82
00:08:14,548 --> 00:08:19,141
to understand what is right and what is
wrong.

83
00:08:19,342 --> 00:08:22,730
Of course, I must say Sahaja Yogis must
have done lots of punyas

84
00:08:22,931 --> 00:08:28,393
and must be very courageous people to be
born in this country.

85
00:08:28,594 --> 00:08:32,533
Otherwise I don't know how you could have
taken your birth here.

86
00:08:32,734 --> 00:08:41,297
The law is so funny that they said it
depends on the mood of the magistrate,

87
00:08:41,498 --> 00:08:48,226
As if, you see, the magistrate doesn't
know the law.

88
00:08:48,822 --> 00:08:53,209
Such a stupid country in modern times
I've never known.

89
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:56,879
Nowhere in the world there's such a stupid
law as it is here.

90
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,137
Of course, in America, there is no justice,
they do what they like.

91
00:09:01,338 --> 00:09:06,816
But here is so-called modern people.

92
00:09:07,017 --> 00:09:11,225
What is their condition is that they have
no sense of law.

93
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,903
If you ask them, "What is the law?"
They don't care.

94
00:09:14,104 --> 00:09:16,744
It's the mood of the magistrate.

95
00:09:16,945 --> 00:09:21,149
Now supposing he has had a big drink
in the last night,

96
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:25,764
second day he comes with a hangover,
so finished.

97
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:33,020
And then he will be very much biased
towards the drunkards only.

98
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:41,305
So, here it is becoming such a horrible
society

99
00:09:41,506 --> 00:09:48,632
that Indians would be shocked, beyond
doubt, but nothing but prostitution.

100
00:09:53,813 --> 00:09:57,857
To see and to be seen.

101
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,411
Why?

102
00:10:00,612 --> 00:10:03,392
Every woman has to dress up in such a way

103
00:10:03,593 --> 00:10:10,275
that she should be attractive, for what?
Is she a prostitute?

104
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:19,454
All kinds of bathroom cultures developed.

105
00:10:19,655 --> 00:10:25,799
For example French bath, you know what
it means, all over the world.

106
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,359
It's a very dirty habit of laziness,
it comes because of drinking.

107
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,189
If you drink too much, next morning you
are so lethargic

108
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:40,779
that you take just a French bath and
go away.

109
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,483
So, please try to remember as French
Sahaja Yogis,

110
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:49,193
that your task is much more difficult
than the task of other countries,

111
00:10:49,394 --> 00:10:57,515
because it lacks completely wisdom.

112
00:10:58,085 --> 00:11:03,393
Neither you'll find in your institutions,
nor in your government,

113
00:11:03,594 --> 00:11:11,227
nor in any education.

114
00:11:11,762 --> 00:11:16,663
It's lacking wisdom completely.

115
00:11:18,262 --> 00:11:22,001
And to have wisdom, according to these
Freudian people,

116
00:11:22,202 --> 00:11:26,269
is that you are egoistical!

117
00:11:29,017 --> 00:11:34,101
They have such funny ideas from the yarn
of Mr. Freud

118
00:11:34,302 --> 00:11:39,276
that no sensible man would accept.

119
00:11:40,482 --> 00:11:46,203
But people have lost their senses,
and like blotting paper,

120
00:11:46,404 --> 00:11:56,567
whatever is filthy, destructive, horrible,
subhuman, they try to absorb.

121
00:11:57,553 --> 00:12:01,743
Supposed to be Christian nation.

122
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:09,781
Please, all Sahaja Yogis must understand:

123
00:12:09,982 --> 00:12:16,057
you must get hold of books and find out,
where are we?

124
00:12:16,258 --> 00:12:20,610
I worked very hard in France, you know
that very well.

125
00:12:20,811 --> 00:12:23,861
I used to think, this is the gate of hell.

126
00:12:24,062 --> 00:12:27,825
But it is much worse than that,

127
00:12:28,026 --> 00:12:33,097
it's a mire of filth. And you are born here

128
00:12:33,298 --> 00:12:39,655
and you have become like lotuses,
so fragrant and beautiful,

129
00:12:39,856 --> 00:12:42,612
you'll have to fight it out.

130
00:12:42,813 --> 00:12:45,752
I am always with you, all My powers
with you.

131
00:12:45,953 --> 00:12:49,127
But remember that you have to fight
the society,

132
00:12:49,328 --> 00:12:54,872
you have to save so many people, you have
to rescue them.

133
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:59,565
Children are given liberty, "Do what
you like."

134
00:12:59,766 --> 00:13:02,819
They have no sense of liberty!

135
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,469
Supposing there's an aeroplane,

136
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:08,472
which was not fixed properly and made
to fly.

137
00:13:08,673 --> 00:13:11,959
What will happen to the aeroplane?

138
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:18,461
If the children are given liberty without
the right sense of their duty

139
00:13:18,662 --> 00:13:23,403
and the right sense about themselves,
what will happen to them?

140
00:13:23,604 --> 00:13:30,761
Why children are born to parents?
It is to get spoiled,

141
00:13:30,962 --> 00:13:36,273
to have liberty or to get some guidance?

142
00:13:36,656 --> 00:13:40,178
You cannot guide your children.

143
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:45,948
They are so rude, they are so arrogant.

144
00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:52,004
They have gone off, completely.

145
00:13:52,205 --> 00:13:55,917
You know for one month we had to struggle
with these western children.

146
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:59,346
And we had come to the point of urge
of closing down that school

147
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:03,656
because they were really violent children,

148
00:14:03,857 --> 00:14:06,857
as if coming from some jungle.

149
00:14:07,064 --> 00:14:11,115
Even the jungle animals have some sense.

150
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:15,781
So you have to think about your children.

151
00:14:15,982 --> 00:14:19,338
What's going to happen to your children?

152
00:14:19,539 --> 00:14:23,429
What is going to be their situation?

153
00:14:23,802 --> 00:14:29,745
If they are going to live in the same
manner in this dirt,

154
00:14:29,946 --> 00:14:37,220
these children will turn out to be waste,
just a waste!

155
00:14:37,421 --> 00:14:43,324
They will have no education, no character,
no personality,

156
00:14:43,525 --> 00:14:53,264
they'll end up with AIDS or with drugs
or something like that.

157
00:14:53,465 --> 00:14:59,636
I do not see any future for the children
of France, no future.

158
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:08,224
And you have to fight that, "We want
to have future for our children,

159
00:15:08,425 --> 00:15:11,084
we don't want them to be ruined."

160
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:15,301
And you must have courage to fight it.

161
00:15:15,502 --> 00:15:19,812
It's very important to have courage.

162
00:15:20,013 --> 00:15:25,104
If you do not have the courage, you cannot
fight it.

163
00:15:25,305 --> 00:15:31,371
And today's puja is to give that courage
in your hearts.

164
00:15:31,572 --> 00:15:37,451
See it all around you, what's happening?

165
00:15:37,652 --> 00:15:41,374
You are all nicely enjoying yourself
in the realm of God,

166
00:15:41,575 --> 00:15:43,473
you have entered into the Kingdom of God.

167
00:15:43,674 --> 00:15:47,955
But what about the rest of the people?

168
00:15:48,173 --> 00:15:53,084
The majority of the people, where are they
going?

169
00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:10,397
What is going to be the future of this
horrible Mooladhara place?

170
00:16:12,151 --> 00:16:17,760
Now Freud has been discovered
as a fraudulent man,

171
00:16:17,961 --> 00:16:20,874
and now there are books after so many
years,

172
00:16:21,075 --> 00:16:25,054
when he has already ruined the people
all over the world.

173
00:16:25,255 --> 00:16:29,735
But the worst of all, they have ruined
here.

174
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:36,598
It's a responsibility specially
of the women I think,

175
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:40,644
because they are responsible for
the society.

176
00:16:40,845 --> 00:16:46,221
The society of France has gone to dogs

177
00:16:46,657 --> 00:16:52,837
and for you to now take up upon yourself

178
00:16:53,038 --> 00:16:59,471
to talk against this kind of anarchy

179
00:16:59,672 --> 00:17:05,082
that is working out the destruction
of your families.

180
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:15,379
If the women decide, I am sure, they
can very, very easily work it out.

181
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:20,649
Instead of asking for liberation
nonsensical,

182
00:17:21,225 --> 00:17:25,874
you better ask for the ascent of this
country.

183
00:17:26,075 --> 00:17:29,236
I know, I've worked very hard and you are
all there.

184
00:17:29,437 --> 00:17:32,229
I am very happy to see that you all
are there

185
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:44,084
to fulfill the desires of the Divine.

186
00:17:44,285 --> 00:17:50,010
Because now you should know in a very
big way,

187
00:17:50,211 --> 00:17:56,042
masses of masses of people will be
destroyed.

188
00:17:59,821 --> 00:18:04,261
Not from without but from within.

189
00:18:05,995 --> 00:18:11,945
Suddenly you'll hear so many millions
disappear with this disease.

190
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:20,906
Also you must protect yourself, all of you:

191
00:18:21,107 --> 00:18:28,624
always give yourself a bandhan; always
lead a clean life.

192
00:18:28,825 --> 00:18:35,051
There are certain hygienic rules of Sahaja
Yoga, please try to follow them.

193
00:18:35,252 --> 00:18:38,424
Do not neglect it.

194
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:42,644
If somebody gets AIDS, you'll not have him
in Sahaja Yoga,

195
00:18:42,845 --> 00:18:47,294
whatever may be the conditions, whatever
may be the reason.

196
00:18:49,387 --> 00:18:54,787
You have to be very careful, also I would
say never treat a AIDS patient.

197
00:18:54,988 --> 00:18:57,573
Like the one yesterday who was arguing
with Me,

198
00:18:57,774 --> 00:19:01,890
actually because they have only two types
of people:

199
00:19:02,091 --> 00:19:09,117
one who are arrogant and another one
which always

200
00:19:11,347 --> 00:19:16,129
think that it's better they should die.
They have no will to live.

201
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:20,848
So there are only two types of people,
either right-sided or left-sided.

202
00:19:21,049 --> 00:19:25,605
And they can never ascend. We have tried,
we have tried.

203
00:19:25,806 --> 00:19:28,915
Of course, one person is living
for the last seven years,

204
00:19:29,153 --> 00:19:34,560
but still he has no faith in himself.

205
00:19:34,761 --> 00:19:40,066
Maybe next generation might be better on,
if they come back.

206
00:19:40,267 --> 00:19:44,435
But as far as this generation is concerned,

207
00:19:44,636 --> 00:19:49,391
you should know your responsibility
is very great.

208
00:19:49,592 --> 00:19:54,335
All the Sahaja Yogis must take a vow

209
00:19:54,536 --> 00:19:59,372
that they'll fight this society and try
to save their country

210
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:05,138
and their countrymen from a complete
disaster.

211
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:08,707
There is going to be no war,

212
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:13,975
only they will fight themselves and die.

213
00:20:15,951 --> 00:20:18,232
It's a very serious matter.

214
00:20:18,433 --> 00:20:23,809
For that, we decided to have this puja
of Durga today

215
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:28,278
that all negativity should be destroyed.

216
00:20:28,479 --> 00:20:35,485
So many Deities build up the body of Kali.

217
00:20:35,686 --> 00:20:41,202
Every part of Her body was created
by a Deity, looked after by a Deity,

218
00:20:41,403 --> 00:20:49,187
and is also, later on, is reflected
in you all.

219
00:20:51,381 --> 00:20:55,455
So they say that God has made human beings
in His own image,

220
00:20:55,656 --> 00:20:59,277
I would say, I've made you in My own
image,

221
00:20:59,478 --> 00:21:04,391
all the Deities at your disposal.

222
00:21:04,592 --> 00:21:08,889
They're all with you, and they have created
you - if you see it minutely -

223
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:14,379
it is the Deities who have brought forth
all the beauty that you had.

224
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:24,178
They have made all this beautiful
congregation, beautiful transformation,

225
00:21:24,379 --> 00:21:32,034
and they have created such angelic people
out of you.

226
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:35,306
They are always working it out,

227
00:21:35,507 --> 00:21:40,980
but one thing you have to do is to have
the drive.

228
00:21:41,181 --> 00:21:46,332
You had pure desire to ascend, but
for what?

229
00:21:46,533 --> 00:21:50,964
You want to have the light, but for what?

230
00:21:51,165 --> 00:21:55,111
You want to become gurus, for what?

231
00:21:55,312 --> 00:21:59,905
To save people, for their salvation.

232
00:22:00,135 --> 00:22:03,549
Only through your channels I can work out
Sahaja Yoga.

233
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:06,981
If I could work out Myself, I would have.

234
00:22:07,182 --> 00:22:11,739
It's not question of killing one rakshasa.

235
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:16,855
God knows how many there are, rakshasas
and rakshasas.

236
00:22:17,056 --> 00:22:23,062
And they are everywhere, even within you
they were.

237
00:22:23,263 --> 00:22:26,759
Now they have gone away.

238
00:22:30,103 --> 00:22:35,893
So you have to do full justice to Sahaja
Yoga, that's very important.

239
00:22:36,094 --> 00:22:39,088
I knew the puja would be very late,
because Kali's puja

240
00:22:39,289 --> 00:22:45,652
is always done in the night, after twelve.
So it had to be this way.

241
00:22:45,853 --> 00:22:48,287
Though last night I slept at four o'clock
and I,  tonight,

242
00:22:48,488 --> 00:22:55,483
I don't know what time I will sleep -
it all works out. It's all worked out.

243
00:22:55,684 --> 00:22:58,734
But you have to have deliberations
and you have to think,

244
00:22:58,935 --> 00:23:01,547
“What can we do to change this?”

245
00:23:01,748 --> 00:23:08,538
Why not write some books, why not write
some experiences?

246
00:23:08,739 --> 00:23:14,257
Get them published in French only. Let
the French know what’s happening outside.

247
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:18,610
Get some of the books translated –

248
00:23:19,972 --> 00:23:26,226
some American books, some English books.
At least give quotations from there.

249
00:23:26,427 --> 00:23:30,581
How they are unaware. First this Catholic
church has to go away.

250
00:23:30,782 --> 00:23:37,014
It will, no doubt, I am sure about it.
They are literally frightened of us.

251
00:23:42,929 --> 00:23:49,566
And we have to now really show them
what we are capable of.

252
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:59,370
And the funniest thing is that a president
has chosen

253
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:01,938
his lady-friend as the prime minister.

254
00:24:02,139 --> 00:24:09,133
I mean, it’s not possible in any sensible
country. It’s never heard of.

255
00:24:09,334 --> 00:24:14,475
I must say, English are thousand times
better.

256
00:24:15,363 --> 00:24:17,801
They are really very good.

257
00:24:18,002 --> 00:24:21,861
At least, as far as administration
is concerned,

258
00:24:22,062 --> 00:24:26,024
as far as their parliament is concerned.
Their justice is not stupid like this,

259
00:24:26,225 --> 00:24:31,159
it’s based on law, not based on the mood
of a magistrate.

260
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,662
How you are still continuing with such
stupidity

261
00:24:34,863 --> 00:24:39,579
which are really even before medieval age:

262
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:45,683
primitive, people are absolutely primitive
to accept such laws.

263
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:53,803
At least you can write a book about
the strange laws of French, one title.

264
00:24:58,013 --> 00:25:01,644
How it has harmed. There is a very nice
book, “Fraudulent Freud”.

265
00:25:01,845 --> 00:25:06,227
Please read that, and see how Freud
has ruined the French,

266
00:25:06,428 --> 00:25:09,861
how their brains are twisted, how they
have twisted ideas.

267
00:25:10,062 --> 00:25:14,260
You are all so intelligent, clever people.

268
00:25:16,633 --> 00:25:23,996
So if not with the sword, Kali has to work
through the pen.

269
00:25:30,921 --> 00:25:37,017
I never knew it was in that bad shape,
though I knew it was.

270
00:25:38,478 --> 00:25:43,643
So this is a challenge for all of us,

271
00:25:43,844 --> 00:25:50,924
and let Me see what you can write, all
of you, put together your experiences:

272
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:54,455
how the French parents behave, how
the grandparents behave,

273
00:25:54,656 --> 00:25:58,896
what’s happening in this country and
all that.

274
00:26:04,198 --> 00:26:08,391
They are living in fool’s paradise.

275
00:26:10,509 --> 00:26:18,749
They don’t know how destruction is just
hanging over their heads.

276
00:26:22,562 --> 00:26:27,783
Though you are all saved, but you have
to think of others,

277
00:26:27,984 --> 00:26:35,469
that is what Sahaja Yoga is, that is not
only that we care for the bhaktas –

278
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:44,109
like Kali just wanted to protect
the bhaktas, the sadhakas.

279
00:26:44,847 --> 00:26:53,841
But you have to protect many, many more
people.

280
00:26:54,042 --> 00:27:00,780
You have all the powers, just assume them
and use them.

281
00:27:02,582 --> 00:27:05,536
You can do it.

282
00:27:05,737 --> 00:27:09,096
Your media is the worst of all

283
00:27:09,297 --> 00:27:13,588
and we can start a newspaper also calling
it anti-media.

284
00:27:13,789 --> 00:27:17,012
What can they do to us?

285
00:27:17,213 --> 00:27:22,410
Or some sort of an independent name,
we can give it.

286
00:27:22,957 --> 00:27:26,531
And it should be open for people who
are suffering

287
00:27:26,732 --> 00:27:33,170
from media sensationalization.
They can write:

288
00:27:33,371 --> 00:27:37,165
how the media is harming them, how they
are giving false reports and things.

289
00:27:37,366 --> 00:27:40,492
We can! Why not?

290
00:27:43,564 --> 00:27:46,793
I am sure it will work out.

291
00:27:48,374 --> 00:27:53,378
Think it over what you can do with
your pen.

292
00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:01,487
Whatever you have gained, whatever you
are enjoying: beautiful music,

293
00:28:01,688 --> 00:28:05,184
all the pujas, everything. But think
of others.

294
00:28:05,385 --> 00:28:11,878
They are already drunk and tossing
their heads on their pillows.

295
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:18,213
Think of them. They, when will they feel
this joy?

296
00:28:18,432 --> 00:28:21,057
I simply feel pity for them

297
00:28:21,258 --> 00:28:25,616
that they should have taken to all these
bad things,

298
00:28:25,817 --> 00:28:27,818
because of the suppression of the Catholic
church.

299
00:28:28,019 --> 00:28:30,226
It’s the Catholic church which has
suppressed them,

300
00:28:30,427 --> 00:28:33,588
that’s why they have come to this.
No other way –

301
00:28:33,789 --> 00:28:38,227
reason why they should accept this kind
of thing.

302
00:28:42,516 --> 00:28:47,243
In Sahaja Yoga, we do not do all these
things, we are in the centre.

303
00:28:47,444 --> 00:28:51,465
We do not have this kind of problems,
because we don’t suppress anyone,

304
00:28:51,666 --> 00:28:55,790
nor do we go to the other extreme
of indulgences.

305
00:28:55,991 --> 00:28:59,440
I think the whole Europe can be divided
into two types of people:

306
00:28:59,641 --> 00:29:03,807
one are Anglo-Saxons, and others are
Latins.

307
00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:08,901
Anglo-Saxons are right-sided and the Latins
are left-sided:

308
00:29:09,102 --> 00:29:16,498
they cry, weep, miserable, they indulge
into dirt and filth.

309
00:29:17,127 --> 00:29:20,196
Just these two types they are.

310
00:29:20,397 --> 00:29:26,056
Now, unluckily you are in the Latin side.

311
00:29:26,814 --> 00:29:33,165
So here, Catholic church is prospering.

312
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:39,251
Now, if you see to the Latin side and
understand

313
00:29:39,452 --> 00:29:42,833
to what extent they have gone to the left
side,

314
00:29:43,034 --> 00:29:48,125
and getting to the left side what diseases
you get, very nicely,

315
00:29:48,326 --> 00:29:51,619
make a list of them.

316
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:56,292
So what I said will work out in France:

317
00:29:56,493 --> 00:30:00,311
the left-sided incurable diseases.

318
00:30:00,512 --> 00:30:04,086
As it is, you walk on the street, you find
at least three, four

319
00:30:04,287 --> 00:30:09,518
mad people, lunatic people walking,
you’ll find them.

320
00:30:10,321 --> 00:30:15,066
Very simple it is. You don’t have to go
to the lunatic asylum, on the street!

321
00:30:15,267 --> 00:30:20,936
They’ll be all talking and saying things,
but it’s all there.

322
00:30:21,137 --> 00:30:24,574
“That’s why they drink, that’s why they
are miserable.”.

323
00:30:24,774 --> 00:30:30,335
I do not know what are the statistics
of the diseases.

324
00:30:34,743 --> 00:30:39,580
So the problem is extremely grave,
very grave.

325
00:30:39,781 --> 00:30:43,098
And you have to work it out,

326
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:48,214
with the gravity of your Gurupada which
you have asked Me the other day –

327
00:30:48,415 --> 00:30:54,161
you asked for the status of a guru,
for ladies as well as for men.

328
00:30:54,362 --> 00:30:58,917
And I said, “All right, start!”

329
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:05,477
I hope you all have heard the song
I’ve made, for asking.

330
00:31:05,678 --> 00:31:08,108
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Marathi]

331
00:31:08,309 --> 00:31:09,892
All right, once they will sing that song.

332
00:31:10,093 --> 00:31:12,389
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Marathi]
All right.

333
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:23,002
They will sing that song to you. There are
different requests from the Mother,

334
00:31:23,203 --> 00:31:27,366
and in this the last one is that: “Mother,
now you give us

335
00:31:27,567 --> 00:31:31,727
the Gurupada, the status of a guru.”

336
00:31:31,928 --> 00:31:37,476
But every guru has a duty: to cleanse
the society in which he lives.

337
00:31:37,677 --> 00:31:40,737
It’s his duty, he has to fight it.

338
00:31:40,938 --> 00:31:45,489
Christ fought it alone, so many saints
fought it alone,

339
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:50,787
they were treated very badly, put in jail,
given poisons, things, but they fought it.

340
00:31:50,988 --> 00:31:56,088
In the same way you stand on Truth,
and you have to fight it.

341
00:31:58,346 --> 00:32:01,721
Because you are saints.

342
00:32:05,253 --> 00:32:07,619
May God bless you.

355
00:32:08,294 --> 00:32:13,107
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Marathi]

356
00:32:15,935 --> 00:32:19,943
They’ll repeat it twice, so you can also.

357
00:32:20,864 --> 00:32:22,425
I don’t think all of you have heard it,

358
00:32:22,626 --> 00:32:27,064
because those who came to Guru puja
must have.

359
00:32:50,753 --> 00:32:54,824
