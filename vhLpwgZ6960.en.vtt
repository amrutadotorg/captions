00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:46.030
I’m spell-bound to see all this beautiful

00:04:46.030 --> 00:05:20.800
expression of your love. Such attention
and creativity. I must be the luckiest guru
to get the outside nature reproduced here

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:57.139
so beautifully. After seeing this, no guru
can escape complete melting of his heart.

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:28.199
Actually, My disciples are very clever people.
They can neutralize any guru. So that guru’s

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:40.900
staff which is used for disciplining the disciple
also melts away into a lotus.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:57.189
Every time it’s such a beautiful surprise
to see how Sahaja yogis are getting one with

00:06:57.189 --> 00:07:13.259
the Divine. The expression of their joy, the
conception of the Divine you can see very

00:07:13.259 --> 00:07:33.860
clearly. This is how I want you all to sit
in the Kingdom of God as I am sitting today.

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:46.399
We have to realize that we are now the part
and parcel of that cosmic consciousness itself

00:07:46.399 --> 00:08:12.300
– the Brahma. The One that creates, which
coordinates, which plans into all the details

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:26.020
and the One that loves through its creation,
through its expression is that cosmic consciousness.

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:47.100
We are not only in it, but we can handle it.
We can regulate it, we can use it, we can

00:08:47.100 --> 00:09:02.450
work it out.
This is the state when we are in we are the

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:32.070
guru. Guru means a thing which is higher than
the gravity of the earth, or stronger than

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:45.860
the gravity of the earth. What is the gravity
of the earth? Superficially when we see that

00:09:45.860 --> 00:10:01.029
we understand it as a thing that acts on our
body to keep us on the ground. Also there

00:10:01.029 --> 00:10:09.769
is a load of a big atmosphere on our head,
of many elephants standing on our head. Plus

00:10:09.769 --> 00:10:14.139
the Mother Earth has the gravity to pull us
towards herself.

00:10:14.139 --> 00:10:25.600
That’s on the gross level we understand
the gravity and on the gross level also we

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:38.120
sometimes understand the Guru Principle.
On the gross level we think a good guru is

00:10:38.120 --> 00:11:14.540
that person who just attracts you towards
himself –
body attraction, or may be other attractions

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:34.120
which are gross. And that’s why people always
go to the gurus who are false, who are superficial.

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:47.660
But the one who is above the gravity of the
Mother Earth, the gross, the subtle, the subtle,

00:11:47.660 --> 00:12:07.600
subtler and the subtlest – beyond all these
attractions – that is the one, is the guru.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:17.720
So in the very gross way we see that normally
people are attracted towards other through

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:29.180
the body element, the gravity acting through
the body.

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:45.350
A guru who looks like a cinema actor is very
much appreciated. They cannot see the totality

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:58.120
of beauty, but just one aspect.
The earlier gurus, who came as false gurus

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:11.350
used to paint their faces even, in India.
Or they would go to special decorators, who

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:25.420
would make their hair look like Shankara’s
jatas and eyes were painted with big black

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:36.519
coal up to this. And the whole body was covered
with a funny type of a powder.

00:13:36.519 --> 00:13:51.940
Or they would wear a kashaya, a cloth that
was given a color of saffron without using

00:13:51.940 --> 00:14:02.040
the saffron. In two rupees you can get that.
And people would be attracted towards such

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:20.240
a person. They would carry an elephant, to
sit on an elephant, even to add to the propensity

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:29.660
of the superficial gravity and walk on the
streets. And people would bow to them and

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:50.560
give them whatever they wanted.
This cannot elevate anyone. Any body attraction

00:14:50.560 --> 00:15:13.980
can enslave you, cannot give you freedom.
It will give you habits for your body enslavements,

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:39.540
and also it will enslave you to your guru
if he knows how to keep attractive in various

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:56.420
ways.
The whole understanding of the cosmic consciousness

00:15:56.420 --> 00:16:10.740
can be put in one little sentence: that it
cannot be attracted by the gravity of any

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:26.610
stars, earth, moon or sun.
The other attractions one has from the Mother

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:43.190
Earth are all for food, greed, lust – materialism
at its worst. It comes from matter.

00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:52.800
All that comes from matter, once you start
getting used to it you become a slave and

00:16:52.800 --> 00:17:08.459
not a guru. So the first attempt should be
for anybody: to be a good guru is to get over

00:17:08.459 --> 00:17:20.209
material attraction.
In a subtler way we can see it happens like

00:17:20.209 --> 00:17:30.059
this: a lady or a gentleman buys an ashram
in Sahaja Yoga. And a Sahaja yogi start living

00:17:30.059 --> 00:17:45.230
in that ashram. The owner of that house starts
worrying about the house and all material

00:17:45.230 --> 00:18:01.169
things in that house rather than the emancipation
of the disciples or the Sahaja yogis who are

00:18:01.169 --> 00:18:06.260
there.
The whole attention is towards the material

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:22.640
upkeep of the house and not towards the emancipation
of the Sahaja yogis who are supposed to rise

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:33.690
into the cosmic consciousness.
And such a person, if he starts believing

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:46.539
that he is the guru or in any way even a Sahaja
yogi, he is sadly mistaken.

00:18:46.539 --> 00:18:59.559
Where is your attention is the point. If you
are the guru, where is your attention? If

00:18:59.559 --> 00:19:12.990
your attention is on the correction and the
nourishment of yourself and of others then

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:27.580
you are first of all the Sahaja yogi. And
once you rise above the gravitational force

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:41.090
of materialism, then you could be called as
the guru.

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:54.780
Anything that is living has a capacity to
rise against the gravity, up to a point, that

00:19:54.780 --> 00:20:05.289
is limited. Like we have seen the trees, they
come out of the Mother Earth and grow upward,

00:20:05.289 --> 00:20:13.750
up to a limited space.
Every tree, every type of tree has its own

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:27.570
limitations. Cedar will be cedar and rose
will be a rose. Is all controlled by the gravitational

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:47.730
force. But there is one thing which rises
against the gravitational force which has

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:58.100
no limits, and that is your Kundalini.
It cannot be controlled by the gravitational

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:16.620
force unless and until you want it to be controlled.
Nothing can control it but you and your Self

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:30.559
can control it. So, as soon as you become
in charge of your Kundalini, you have crossed

00:21:30.559 --> 00:21:47.740
one step forward that you have overcome the
force that is the gravitational force.

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:56.200
Then the cycle of all the five elements is
bound together. All the five elements have

00:21:56.200 --> 00:22:11.590
to go in a cycle in such a way that nothing
is wasted, nothing is spoiled, everything

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:26.919
is organized. But this cycle is broken only
by the awakening of the Kundalini. Because

00:22:26.919 --> 00:22:42.750
you enter into the highest of highest, which
is the cosmic consciousness, which you know

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:56.090
how to regulate yourself.
That cosmic consciousness is the Param Tattwa,

00:22:56.090 --> 00:23:08.470
is the principle of all the principles, controls
all the principles. So it controls also the

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:21.669
principles of all these five elements. It
controls the Mana Shakti. It controls the

00:23:21.669 --> 00:23:33.990
evolution and gives you the power to evolve
others. So, this great Brahma Shakti is at

00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:43.529
your lotus feet.
Perhaps Sahaja yogis do not realize what they

00:23:43.529 --> 00:24:02.370
have achieved. The only difference between
a Adi Guru and a guru, Satguru I would say,

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:15.580
is this that the Adi Guru knows that He is
the controlling power. He knows He is with

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:30.610
absolute oneness with the Brahma Tattwa, with
the cosmic. The authority with which He talks,

00:24:30.610 --> 00:24:43.770
the complete confidence with which He says
things. There’s no doubt in His mind. In

00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:59.370
anyone of His teachings He’ll say, “I
verily say to you that confidence that I am

00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:19.890
with the Brahma Tattwa, that I am the Brahma
and that I am controlling all that Tattwa,”

00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:27.039
makes Him a prophet.
Because whatever He says, prophesizes, is

00:25:27.039 --> 00:25:40.970
the truth. Whatever He says about the past
is the truth. And He knows that; He has no

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:51.799
doubts.
The authority with which Moses talked, authority

00:25:51.799 --> 00:26:05.110
with which Socrates talked, authority with
which Lao Tse talked – all these great Adi

00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:21.100
Gurus, from Adi Nath to Sai Nath, they didn’t
say, “If you do this way will be good, or

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:34.960
that way would be good.” No, “This is
what it is, you better do it!” This is what

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:46.370
it is.
But in modern times those gurus may not work

00:26:46.370 --> 00:27:03.659
out. That’s why a Mother had to come. First
to give you realization.

00:27:03.659 --> 00:27:10.580
Because these gurus did not realize another
point: that their disciples not understand

00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:20.460
them at all. Whatever they are doing, they
are doing out of awe. But awe doesn’t have

00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:34.200
understanding in it. Or even the earlier ones
may have had, the generation that came afterwards

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:43.769
did not have.
So they turned the gurus into a façade and

00:27:43.769 --> 00:27:53.580
the whole building they owned as their own.
Creating all kinds of problems, killing the

00:27:53.580 --> 00:28:09.519
universality and the collectivity because
Brahma Tattwa is the power of the collectivity.

00:28:09.519 --> 00:28:22.740
Is in everything – in the atom, in the molecule,
in the human heart. Everywhere it is reflected,

00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:43.110
depending on the reflector. And it controls.
This understanding they had, but the human

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:49.070
understanding perhaps they did not have. That
if you today tell them something they might

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:54.470
listen to us, but tomorrow they will forget.
So, it was necessary that you all should be

00:28:54.470 --> 00:29:01.360
given realization. Otherwise, also without
realization, what’s the use? What’s the

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:13.059
use of talking to people about the colors,
those who don’t have eyes? So realization

00:29:13.059 --> 00:29:29.789
has to be given. But it should not be done
with diffidence. When a guru does not feel

00:29:29.789 --> 00:29:41.590
vibrations properly, he become diffident about
giving realization. But even when he feels

00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:54.120
it clearly he will not say things with authority.
Authority by any chance does not mean aggressiveness.

00:29:54.120 --> 00:30:00.580
Authority is because you have it, that’s
why you express it.

00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:10.179
Like this light is now shining on My face.
It is shining; it’s not aggressive. Because

00:30:10.179 --> 00:30:15.820
that’s the quality it has got – that it
has to shine, so it is shining.

00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:40.130
In the same way a guru shines before the disciples.
It’s very easy to understand this word shine.

00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:50.630
When you have something dirty, it doesn’t
shine. Even the gold which is always shining,

00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:59.870
is not tarnishable, if you put it under the
mud it won’t shine. So you have to wash

00:30:59.870 --> 00:31:07.649
it, clean it and rub it nicely so that it
shines.

00:31:07.649 --> 00:31:27.080
But in Guru Tattwa it is from the basics you
have to start. Before the gold came into its

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:39.710
own state of gold it was mixed with so many
other things. So it had to be heated up, melted

00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:49.450
away, sieved out, and so many processes it
had to go through to become gold. So, when

00:31:49.450 --> 00:32:06.880
you become Sahaja yogis, you have become gold.
Now, the second job is to keep this gold shining.

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:30.260
And third would be to get a part in the crown
of your Mother, so that you can never be tarnished.

00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:43.340
Into these three stages one has to come. First
of all to judge yourself to be a guru you

00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:55.919
have to have a gravity of your own, which
is not bound by the gravity of the Mother

00:32:55.919 --> 00:33:15.799
Earth. That’s the minimum of minimum.
Which does not mean you wear outside the kashaya,

00:33:15.799 --> 00:33:26.149
the dress that suggests that you are a sanyasi.
But from inside you should be a sanyasi. Now

00:33:26.149 --> 00:33:40.399
a sanyasi who is inside a sanyasi will have
a big bank balance, maybe, but will know nothing

00:33:40.399 --> 00:33:53.490
about it. Will be very indifferent and any
day willing to part with it.

00:33:53.490 --> 00:34:15.450
A sanyasi has to be a person above lust. Should
not know what is a lust is, what is this attraction

00:34:15.450 --> 00:34:33.380
of lust is. That through his Kundalini and
Mooladhara he can achieve it. Because now

00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:47.830
you have a capacity to rise above the gravity.
You have got that power now to rise about

00:34:47.830 --> 00:34:59.290
this lust business where your attention gets
absolutely ruined.

00:34:59.290 --> 00:35:04.300
But in Sahaja Yoga we have everything.
Like on Indian streets you’ll find the most

00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:14.920
modern car, a Rolls Royce, Mercedes as well
as you can find a bullock cart and also lots

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:24.160
of cows and buffalos, everything there. In
the same way, I think, in Sahaja Yoga we have

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:40.030
all kinds.
We have some people who are very great and

00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:54.080
try to achieve a state of untarnishability,
put their attention to it, work it out. But

00:35:54.080 --> 00:36:05.200
we also have people who are absolutely useless
things, just hanging onto Sahaja Yoga to use

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:19.930
Sahaja Yoga for their own popularity, maybe,
for their own gains. I don’t know for what.

00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:32.110
I have seen people who give lectures in the
name of Sahaja Yoga and are badly caught up.

00:36:32.110 --> 00:36:46.000
There is that gravity acting in you, remember
that. The gravity of the Mother Earth. Some

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:57.570
sort of a gravity which should be located.
But some of them are nothing but worms, they

00:36:57.570 --> 00:37:10.990
cannot go higher. And the outsiders see those
worms only and try to say that Sahaja Yoga

00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:23.750
is no good.
Your Kundalini has the power, it has all the

00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:41.500
powers to make you the highest of highest.
An ordinary grass can become a cedar. There’s

00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:57.630
no limits to it. But you must have confidence
in yourself and confidence in Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:57.630 --> 00:38:07.960
If you don’t have confidence in yourself
or in Sahaja Yoga, nothing can work it out.

00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:22.220
But the highest of all is the sincerity which
nobody can instill in you. There are so many

00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:32.220
descriptions of a guru, how a Satguru should
be. Not in the West, I didn’t see that,

00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:36.700
because I think they never believed in gurus,
but they have lots of gurus, like Pope is

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:43.950
another horrible, fake guru sitting here.
Then we have another one, Bishop of Canterbury

00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:47.690
sitting there.
All of them are false gurus, know nothing

00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:58.010
about Kundalini, don’t know anything Brahma.
And they just want to denounce Indian ideas

00:38:58.010 --> 00:39:04.360
not because they are Indian, but because if
Sahaja Yoga is established they will lose

00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:13.660
all their earnings. From where will they get
their money and their crowns? So they want

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:20.640
to propound that they are the solution, achieving
nothing, spoiling the name of Christ, saying

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:30.140
all kinds of things against Him, stupidly,
without knowing the Divine.

00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:38.290
Then we have many in the Islam, horrible people,
just the opposite of Mohammed Sahib, doing

00:39:38.290 --> 00:39:46.460
all wrong things in the name of Mohammed Sahib.
It’s something like one can understand that

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:56.080
a thief has to become an imposter to behave
like a king to show that he is not a thief

00:39:56.080 --> 00:40:06.070
and to have his thieving done. This is how
they are, all of them. Right from India we

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:13.340
have many Brahmins of the same category. This
priesthood has to go. Wherever there is a

00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:22.960
priest, know it’s a mafia. It’s a sophisticated
mafia.

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:55.360
No Sahaja yogi guru is going to take any money,
nor anybody is going to bow to them. Nor they

00:40:55.360 --> 00:41:16.430
are going to take any kind of special attention.
In the sense in one place we had a ashram

00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:28.060
where the guru and the guruvi became very
important, and the guruvi wanted her tea to

00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:37.040
be sent on her bed with a proper table, and
she became a mini-Mataji – or a greater

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:42.550
Mataji, because I don’t demand many things
which she demanded. I never demand anything,

00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:54.840
whatever you do is very great for Me.
And this is how they felt they were great

00:41:54.840 --> 00:42:06.760
gurus by asking for this privilege and that
privilege. Guru has to suffer the most, that’s

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:15.450
how he can command. He has to be the example
of austerity and of detachment, that’s how

00:42:15.450 --> 00:42:23.880
he is going to get respect. In Sahaja Yoga
nobody is going to respect anybody because

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:32.020
that guru has made so much money out of Sahaja
yogis.

00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:41.830
But the attention on money itself of Sahaja
yogis itself is suggestive that they are not

00:42:41.830 --> 00:42:47.700
Sahaja yogis. For example, when you wanted
to collect money – I mean, I never asked

00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:52.750
for a house or anything. The idea came from
some Sahaja yogis – there should be a house

00:42:52.750 --> 00:43:02.350
for Me. Who can house Me? Just think of it.
Is it possible? Is it possible to house Me?

00:43:02.350 --> 00:43:12.870
Not possible. So, with the purpose and with
My name, we could have something done in the

00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:22.890
heart of the universe where everybody is sleeping
practically. We had to do something dynamic

00:43:22.890 --> 00:43:33.350
there. And I heard that some stupid people
started arguing on that. That’s again the

00:43:33.350 --> 00:43:39.010
sign of not understanding. If Mother has said,
“Yes,” She would not do it for no reason.

00:43:39.010 --> 00:43:54.650
So, the power of understanding only come when
we become the power of cosmic consciousness.

00:43:54.650 --> 00:44:00.130
Because cosmic consciousness understands each
and every thing; sitting down here you can

00:44:00.130 --> 00:44:16.730
understand every thing, you don’t have to
go there. Everything. And because your Mother

00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:29.670
is a Mahamaya it may not show, but it will
expose one day. So you have to depend on that

00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:37.760
part of Sahaja Yoga, that it is a Mahamaya’s
job. So we should not get disturbed or upset,

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:49.160
it will show.
So, you are doubly blessed. First of all you

00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:58.630
got your realization, which they say is the
hardest of hardest thing to get. You have

00:44:58.630 --> 00:45:10.820
overcome the gravity. And secondly, your Mother
is the Mother of all the Adi Gurus. She’s

00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:18.480
the One who taught all the Adi Gurus. She
created the Adi Gurus and She’ll create

00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:44.490
out of you the Adi Gurus.
But the quality has to be of gold. The guru

00:45:44.490 --> 00:45:56.930
has to himself accept all the challenges,
everything, to go through it. To work it out,

00:45:56.930 --> 00:46:06.550
to cleanse himself, to see for himself how
far he has reached. He has not just to depend

00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:11.420
on some certificates of you people. It’s
not artificiality; it is not falsehood, is

00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:22.030
reality. And when you come to reality you
must know that you have to be satisfied about

00:46:22.030 --> 00:46:34.510
yourself. Then comes the confidence. That’s
how the authority comes in, that you are sure

00:46:34.510 --> 00:46:47.310
of yourself that whatever you are doing is
the reality. Reality and nothing else.

00:46:47.310 --> 00:47:01.340
And this power is within you. The Kundalini
is within you; She is your own Mother. All

00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:08.620
your life you have wasted in doing all kinds
of things. People have gone into lots of penances

00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:16.540
doing anti-culture, great jobs of ruining
themselves and destroying themselves. What

00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:24.910
did they gain? Then they started another sort.
They are busy now with another trip, and they’ll

00:47:24.910 --> 00:47:31.990
be busy tomorrow with another trip. Or whatever
they do stupid they do it so seriously.

00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:39.930
That’s the most surprising thing is. And
to all the details, you know? Nothing should

00:47:39.930 --> 00:47:50.630
be missing. The complete stupidity must be
achieved with full sincerity. That surprises

00:47:50.630 --> 00:48:01.680
Me the most. And then – what confidence!
If you ask Me, “Why did you do it?” He

00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:08.460
said, “What’s wrong?” You’re amazed.
There should be a new word rather than bumptiousness

00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:14.800
for this kind of thing.
That you cut your nose and when the doctor

00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:18.940
asks you, “Why did you cut it?” he says,
“What’s wrong? I’ve done it well, better

00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:28.650
than you could do.”
This is how human nature is – that stupid.

00:48:28.650 --> 00:48:46.670
But when it comes to reality, how are you?
Devastatingly we work out our destruction.

00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:59.530
Our construction and our ascent – do we
do it that assiduously, with that caution,

00:48:59.530 --> 00:49:13.980
with that care, with that detailed understanding?
And

00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:23.740
the best part of it that when you are doing
it you get joyous – immediately rewarded.

00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:34.340
For example, doing all this you must have
all enjoyed, no doubt. Anything that you do

00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:45.650
in the name of God is immediately rewarded,
the subtlest of subtle in the form of joy.

00:49:45.650 --> 00:49:52.920
And grossest of grossest in the form of all
kinds of things.

00:49:52.920 --> 00:50:02.780
So why not do it, something with complete
understanding? Meticulously, carefully. Why

00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:16.370
not? With full attention and concentration.
Because the reward is joy.

00:50:16.370 --> 00:50:31.480
Ultimately what do we seek is nothing but
joy. Rationally we understand, but not from

00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:39.330
the heart. It doesn’t go in the heart easily.
Now people are saying, “Mother, open my

00:50:39.330 --> 00:50:50.250
heart.” How am I to open it? Just tell Me.
One has to go for an open heart surgery, I

00:50:50.250 --> 00:51:06.720
think, the way things are. To open your heart
the guru has to be generous. Whatever these

00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:12.560
other agurus are doing, just the opposite
of that. What have you given?

00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:23.550
For example, you are having some people with
you in your house – and you are the guru.

00:51:23.550 --> 00:51:38.620
What have you given to them? On material level,
let us see. Then on physical level, have you

00:51:38.620 --> 00:51:46.390
ever massaged their head? I have massaged
so many people’s head. At least fifty percent

00:51:46.390 --> 00:52:00.920
of you had that. What physical comfort you
have given to that person? If you are the

00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:13.680
guru, then what is the emotional confidence
you have given to that person? If you are

00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:22.550
shouting for that person, “Why did you keep
it there? Why didn’t you keep it here?”

00:52:22.550 --> 00:52:28.270
Also it is vice-versa among human beings.
If you try to be nice to somebody that person

00:52:28.270 --> 00:52:36.890
becomes ego-oriented. Dangerous stuff, you
know. You are nice to somebody, you are kind

00:52:36.890 --> 00:52:42.120
to that person, you give him some money, or
you give him something then they say, “You

00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:47.840
go, come and see that person,” I’m surprised
sometimes, how can it be? But it happens.

00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:54.150
I mean, I have been victim of such a nonsense.
The people had to say, “Mother, You have

00:52:54.150 --> 00:53:03.180
spoiled that person.” But I just don’t
know, how can I spoil?

00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:12.500
Why it happens? Because human beings have
another great quality that they cannot understand

00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:20.020
that anybody can care for them, because they
cannot care for anyone. Anybody cares for

00:53:20.020 --> 00:53:36.410
them they become egoistical.
I’ve known about some Indians who went abroad

00:53:36.410 --> 00:53:41.450
and people thought Indians have come as if
Adi Gurus have come. They can be worse than

00:53:41.450 --> 00:53:54.070
you people. And are, no doubt. And then you
start worshipping them as Indians. And then

00:53:54.070 --> 00:53:59.880
you understand that this is just a donkey
from India you have brought, which is kicking

00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:09.890
you all the time.
The image of that Indian goodness is not there.

00:54:09.890 --> 00:54:25.060
Because of this problem the guru finds it
impossible how to deal with the disciples.

00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:39.830
But there is a solution: leave it to your
Mother and I’ll put them right. All such

00:54:39.830 --> 00:54:52.570
problems you can leave it to Me. When people
try to take advantage of you or take to ego,

00:54:52.570 --> 00:54:55.670
tell them, “Now I’m going to leave it
to Mother, I’m not going to look after you

00:54:55.670 --> 00:55:08.890
any more.” That will settle them right.
They do not know that this cosmic consciousness

00:55:08.890 --> 00:55:22.790
is also very mischievous. It has lots of mischiefs
up its sleeves. And it can work at such mischiefs

00:55:22.790 --> 00:55:30.850
that people are amazed and aghast. So, all
such problems, if you cannot deal you can

00:55:30.850 --> 00:55:37.430
leave it to Me. And another one is to their
Kundalini, to tell them that they are catching

00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:43.190
on this or catching on that. It’s your duty
to tell them that “You’re catching on

00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:58.070
your ego. Better be corrected.”
Now, all of you can become gurus. Every one

00:55:58.070 --> 00:56:07.740
of you can become gurus and can develop that
great capacity to be one with that cosmic

00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:23.950
consciousness, completely out of the clutches
of the gravity of the earth – materialism.

00:56:23.950 --> 00:56:34.820
Without achieving that you have no right to
tell anybody what is to be done.

00:56:34.820 --> 00:56:46.300
First it should be your practice and precept
in your own life, in your own example. And

00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:53.900
then your example is sufficient to convince
others.

00:56:53.900 --> 00:57:03.260
Today, through this understanding that you
have to rise above the gravitational force

00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:08.520
of materialism which is today’s religion
everywhere, whatever they may call it. Whether

00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:18.470
it is communism or capitalism or democracy
or demonocracy. Whether it is Christianity,

00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:28.900
Hinduism, Islam or any other nonsense – all
of that is nothing but materialism in its

00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:45.430
all absurd forms. Kundalini is the only thing
that can take you like the stalk of the lotus

00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:58.400
out of this mud of materialism.
And that is what one has to achieve, specially

00:57:58.400 --> 00:58:12.350
in the West. It goes in the subtle and subtler
and subtlest forms, so be on the lookout,

00:58:12.350 --> 00:58:32.100
and ultimately it expresses itself as ego.
All materialists are egoistical, racist – they

00:58:32.100 --> 00:58:41.740
are robbers and plunderers. They go to other
countries like South Africa and settle down

00:58:41.740 --> 00:58:50.250
nicely, robbers and plunderers. And extracting
the wealth of another.

00:58:50.250 --> 00:59:10.710
All this can become very sophisticated and
beautified – we have to fight that. But

00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:18.720
to fight that we have to get out of it completely.
Otherwise we cannot fight it when we are in

00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:26.720
it. So all of us should try to get out of
it fully. It does not mean that you should

00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:31.280
all take out your clothes and say that “We
have given up everything.” That’s another

00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:41.010
style it has started now. It means that you
respect all that is beautiful, you respect

00:59:41.010 --> 00:59:52.280
all that is good, but you are not dominated
by anything. You are not in the clutches of

00:59:52.280 --> 01:00:02.990
anything.
If I want I can wear a gold chain, otherwise

01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:13.510
nothing, doesn’t bother, I don’t care.
That should be the attitude: if I have, or

01:00:13.510 --> 01:00:20.870
if I have to, I will.
Nothing can dominate Me. Nothing can give

01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:32.610
Me status. I stand on My own status and on
My position and on My authority. Because I’m

01:00:32.610 --> 01:00:48.900
that pure consciousness. Nothing can spoil
Me, nothing can bring Me down, nothing can

01:00:48.900 --> 01:01:01.930
bow Me. I cannot make anyone dominated by
Me either.

01:01:01.930 --> 01:01:11.300
This is how we are going to become great gurus.
Imagine – six hundred and twenty people

01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:29.060
are here and one guru is sufficient to change
the whole world. With six hundred and twenty

01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:48.480
gurus, God save the world now.
There’s a beautiful saying of Adi Shankaracharya,

01:01:48.480 --> 01:02:02.520
Tad Nishkala, about Brahma Tattwa. I’m that
Brahma. On that. If you have? Let Me see.

01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:14.780
That’s the best way to understand what you
are. Just bring it. It’s very famous. Have

01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:20.850
you got it?
Sahaja yogi: Dakshina Murti?

01:02:20.850 --> 01:02:33.880
Shri Mataji: No, not that, another one. Just
bring it. Have you got the book?

01:02:33.880 --> 01:03:49.660
This is the one. This one is the one. We just
read it in English language.

01:03:49.660 --> 01:04:08.910
When you have got your Nirvana, what happens
to you –
it says that.

01:04:08.910 --> 01:04:19.410
Guido reads:
OM, I’m neither the mind, Intelligence,

01:04:19.410 --> 01:04:32.480
ego nor chitta, Neither the ears nor the tongue,
Nor the senses of smell and sight, Neither

01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:41.220
ether nor air, Nor fire nor water nor earth,
I am eternal bliss and awareness.

01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:50.390
I am Shiva! I am Shiva!
I am neither the prana, Nor the five vital

01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:59.700
breaths, Neither the seven elements of the
body, Nor its five sheaths, Nor hands, nor

01:04:59.700 --> 01:05:10.460
feet, nor tongue, Nor other organs of action.
I am eternal bliss and awareness. I am Shiva!

01:05:10.460 --> 01:05:17.590
I am Shiva!
Neither fear, greed nor delusion, Loathing

01:05:17.590 --> 01:05:27.920
nor liking have I, Nothing of pride or ego,
Of dharma or liberation, Neither desire of

01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:41.140
the mind, Nor object for its desiring. I am
eternal bliss and awareness. I am Shiva! I

01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:46.820
am Shiva!
Nothing of pleasure and pain, Of virtue and

01:05:46.820 --> 01:05:56.780
vice do I know, or mantra, or sacred place,
or Vedas or sacrifice, Neither I am the eater,

01:05:56.780 --> 01:06:06.960
The food nor the act of eating. I am eternal
bliss and awareness. I am Shiva! I am Shiva!

01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:16.980
Death or fear, I have none, Nor any distinction
of caste, Neither father nor mother, Nor even

01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:27.350
a birth have I, Neither friend, nor comrade,
Neither disciple, nor guru. I am eternal bliss

01:06:27.350 --> 01:06:36.760
and awareness. I am Shiva! I am Shiva!
I have no form or fancy, The all-pervading

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:48.730
I am, Everywhere I exist, And yet I am beyond
the senses, Neither salvation I am, Nor anything

01:06:48.730 --> 01:06:57.400
to be known. I am eternal bliss and awareness.
I am Shiva! I am Shiva!

01:06:57.400 --> 01:07:07.300
Shri Mataji: That’s what you are. You are
eternal bliss and awareness. The consciousness,

01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:12.100
the pure consciousness.
I think, this must be – everybody must remember

01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:18.980
by heart. And must say in all the ashrams.
That’s a very good way of remembering what

01:07:18.980 --> 01:07:32.150
you are.
May God bless you!

01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:47.520
Sahaja Yogis sing Satchitananda Rupam Shivoham
Shivoham.

01:07:47.520 --> 01:08:17.699
Shri Mataji: Now all the leaders have to come
on
the stage today to help with the puja.

01:08:17.699 --> 01:10:06.970
Yesterday I could not take the name of all
the leaders who were very good, who have come

01:10:06.970 --> 01:10:16.850
very recently and are doing great work like,
persons like Xavier I would say, he has been

01:10:16.850 --> 01:10:24.480
appointed only a few months back in Milano
and he is doing such a good work. And there

01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:39.690
are other people, say in Venice. And also
we see that recently some leaders have been

01:10:39.690 --> 01:10:50.310
appointed in Melouse and Montpellier. They
are doing very good work, I get very good

01:10:50.310 --> 01:10:57.860
reports about that place. I’m amazed how
the new centers have coming up so well. Even

01:10:57.860 --> 01:11:05.770
in Australia there are many new centers that
have come up which are doing such good work.

01:11:05.770 --> 01:11:15.790
In England there are so many new centers that
have started and we are doing good work. Some

01:11:15.790 --> 01:11:21.880
of the old people are dropping out, but the
new people are coming up are very good. We

01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:30.670
find it all over, all over this kind of thing
happening now. A new dynamic leadership is

01:11:30.670 --> 01:11:41.260
coming from people and I’m amazed how they
have joined very recently as leaders of smaller

01:11:41.260 --> 01:11:51.860
places and are doing so good in every country.
Even to take all the names may not be possible,

01:11:51.860 --> 01:12:02.230
but I feel that so many of them have been
really doing such a good job that only Divine

01:12:02.230 --> 01:12:07.460
can explain it.
It’s the Divine’s great blessings that

01:12:07.460 --> 01:12:15.750
we have got all the right people. Sahaja Yoga
is definitely progressing. It should not progress

01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:21.240
faster than the Divine wants it to progress,
and so we should accept that speed.

01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:28.730
But still we should try our level best, because
it is our job to try and work out as much

01:12:28.730 --> 01:12:35.460
as possible and as far as we can go.
May God bless you all.

01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:42.900
All those who are working in smaller places
as leaders, for everyone I get report and

01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:49.690
I understand them and I have tremendous feeling
for all of them. But some of the places where

01:12:49.690 --> 01:12:57.750
there are smaller ashrams and things, problems
are cropping up and I’m surprised how still

01:12:57.750 --> 01:13:05.480
these problems are there. So everybody must
try to correct oneself – should become an

01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:12.950
example of compassion, love and understanding.
And I hope I will have no reports at least

01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:17.930
about the leaders or their wives specially,
the wives. Wives is a big problem, I wish

01:13:17.930 --> 01:13:22.560
I had told something about the wives, maybe
this evening I might be able to speak about

01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:26.590
the wives of the leaders. I’ve been speaking
about them all the time. So, the wives have

01:13:26.590 --> 01:13:32.140
a greater responsibility because they are
the source of compassion and not of disciplining.

01:13:32.140 --> 01:13:43.790
They are the source of joy and not of controlling.
They are the source of motherliness and not

01:13:43.790 --> 01:13:50.550
guruness. So they have to be very different
personalities. Instead of that they think,

01:13:50.550 --> 01:13:54.830
“We are guru’s wives, so we can do what
we like. We can dominate people, and shout

01:13:54.830 --> 01:14:03.710
at people and can arrange everything ourselves.”
No, they have to be completely on the background.

01:14:03.710 --> 01:14:10.190
And for that I can mention it so many of them
are very good wives, who have shown great,

01:14:10.190 --> 01:14:18.160
great understanding of their role as Sahaja
yoginis.

01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:25.910
So, I would request you not to become gurus
yourself, but to become guruvis. And guruvis

01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:37.520
are the ones who look after the other side
of the guru which may be neglected because

01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:44.150
of his disciplining nature which he has to
have. And they are the ones who are the cementing

01:14:44.150 --> 01:14:49.560
factor. If the guru is the brick, they are
the cements. But it acts sometimes other way

01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:53.250
round. So, I didn’t say much about them,
but I hope this evening I might say something

01:14:53.250 --> 01:19:43.710
about them.
May

01:19:43.710 --> 02:46:04.340
God bless you!
