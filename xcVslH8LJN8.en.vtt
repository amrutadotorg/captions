00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:06.880
MODERATOR: (speaking clearly and&nbsp;
enthusiastically) Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi,

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.120
recognized world-wide for her pioneering work in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.640
awakening the natural healing energy&nbsp;
that lies within every human being.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.640
Apparantly it’s called the Kundalini and&nbsp;
we’ll be awakening yours hopefully this hour.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.960
Shri Mataji, that actually means Mother, was on&nbsp;
GM TV [for a popular morning TV show] only last&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.400
week and the switchboards were&nbsp;
actually bombarded with calls.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.160
We wonder if Shri Mataji or Mother&nbsp;
will have the same effect here today.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.440
Keep it on Liberty for a spiritual&nbsp;
awakening in a few moments time.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:01:09.920
(WEATHER REPORT AND SONG.)

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:42.720
MOD: Now my next guest, we’re very&nbsp;
honoured to welcome to the studio today.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.440
Her name is Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.&nbsp;
Shri Mataji actually means Mother

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.600
and She is recognized worldwide for Her&nbsp;
pioneering work in awakening the natural&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.720
healing energy that lies within every human being.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.960
She travels throughout the&nbsp;
world at Her own expense,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.840
teaching this life-changing&nbsp;
technique to millions of people

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.200
and apparantly we don’t have to part with a penny.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.160
On GM TV, only last week,&nbsp;
the switchboard was flooded&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.000
by viewers who’d all experienced strange&nbsp;
phenomena whilst listening to Her.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.840
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi joins&nbsp;
me now. Welcome to the show.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.640
Shri Mataji: Thank you.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.720
MOD: It’s a pleasure to have you here. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.400
you studied medicine and psychology in&nbsp;
your home country of India. Is that right?

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.970
Shri Mataji: I did.

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.120
MOD: And now, you travel the world&nbsp;
teaching Sahaja Yoga. Is that right?

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.914
Shri Mataji: Yes, correct.

00:02:25.914 --> 00:02:29.840
MOD: And, how did you learn this technique?&nbsp;
Is it particularly well known in India.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.800
Shri Mataji: It was used long time&nbsp;
back, but the tradition was they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.360
used to give this awakening only&nbsp;
to one person among thousands.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.880
First they used to test them,&nbsp;
cleanse them, do all kinds of things.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.200
And ultimately they used to give to one person.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.080
One person to one person. That was the tradition.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.200
Only what work I’ve done is to I&nbsp;
have tried to find out human beings,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.880
what the problem with them is.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.200
Why can’t we have en-masse Realization?

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.640
And it worked, it clicked&nbsp;
and I am doing that work.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.800
MOD: So, the very fact that tradition was passed&nbsp;
on to, like you say one in thousands of people.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.400
Would you say that is why the tradition&nbsp;
was actually lost over the years?

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.511
The tradition itself, did.

00:03:13.511 --> 00:03:19.680
Shri Mataji: Ya. It’s not only Indian&nbsp;
tradition. It has been in many countries.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.680
But people aren’t aware of it. See,&nbsp;
everywhere they have talked about it,

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.880
that there’s t ¥his power in the sacrum&nbsp;
bone and that it is to be awakened.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.320
Even the Greeks knew about it because they&nbsp;
called it as sacrum bone meaning a sacred bone.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.960
So, it is not only Indian, it is all over.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.920
People knew about it, but they&nbsp;
didn’t know how to awaken it.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.200
In a far-fetched place called Bolivia,&nbsp;
they know everything about it.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.280
They said two saints came from India&nbsp;
and they taught us, long, long time back

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.000
and but we don’t know how to awaken it.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.040
MOD: Now it’s called as Kundalini, am I right?

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.760
Shri Mataji: Kundalini.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:56.560
MOD: Kundalini.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.720
Shri Mataji: Kundalini means a coil.&nbsp;
It’s coiled up into three and a half.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.120
It has some mathematical relations.&nbsp;
That’s why it’s three and a half coils.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.600
That energy’s coiled up.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.320
MOD: And we have to unravel those coils,&nbsp;
is that right and let the energy flow?

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.680
Shri Mataji: Ya.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.840
MOD: So essentially it’s an energy&nbsp;
force that flows through all of us.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.320
Shri Mataji: No, that Energy is within&nbsp;
you, dormant. It’s not yet awakened.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.360
Once it ¥ is awakened, it passes&nbsp;
through six subtle centres.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.440
And these centres are responsible&nbsp;
for our physical, mental, emotional&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.120
and also spiritual being.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.320
So, when it is there, enlightened. When they&nbsp;
are nourished, we get rid of our diseases,

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.360
we get rid of our mental&nbsp;
problems, we develop a balance,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.840
peace within and, ultimately,&nbsp;
what we get is the joy.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.360
MOD: So, why do you think those energies within&nbsp;
us, then, have been suppressed all these years?

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.760
Shri Mataji: Pardon me?

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.800
MOD: Our energies because you&nbsp;
said they’re not awakened,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.680
so, by definition, that means&nbsp;
that, that they are suppressed.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.960
Are they just suppressed?

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.800
Shri Mataji: No, not suppressed.&nbsp;
They are in a dormant state.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.680
MOD: A dormant state.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.120
Shri Mataji: Ya. They’re not suppressed.&nbsp;
But then, they are to be awakened.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.560
It’s like one candle which is&nbsp;
enlightened can enlighten many candles.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.960
It’s like that. If you get that&nbsp;
awakening, you can awaken thousands.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.040
[SILENCE]

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.440
MOD: It’s fascinating.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.600
My gue §st is Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi,&nbsp;
recognized worldwide for her pioneering&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.280
work in awakening the natural healing&nbsp;
energy that lies within every human being.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.360
It’s called the Kundalini and, hopefully,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:37.840
we’ll give you some tips on how you can&nbsp;
awaken yours in just a few moments time.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.600
[SONG]

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:19.040
MOD: My guest today is Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:24.560
Shri Mataji means Mother and that we’re&nbsp;
awakening a dormant energy in you today.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:31.360
Such is the extent of the awakening in the&nbsp;
country when viewers tuned in to GM TV last week,

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:35.040
that we thought we must welcome Shri&nbsp;
Mataji to the show to see if she can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:40.080
awaken the dormant energy, Kundalini,&nbsp;
the Kundalini, within all of us.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.480
Now, can you, can you, is it&nbsp;
something that you can do,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.920
actually, at home on your own or is it&nbsp;
something that we need you to help us do?

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.600
Shri Mataji: No, you have to ask&nbsp;
some enlightened person to do that.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:50.080
MOD: Right.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:54.640
Shri Mataji: As there is a candle which is not&nbsp;
enlightened, it cannot get enlightened by itself.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.520
So, you have to go to a person who is enlightened.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:01.600
MOD: Like yourself. And this is something&nbsp;
that you can actually do over the air now, if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:02.960
anyone was listening?

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:03.779
Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?

00:09:03.779 --> 00:09:05.760
MOD: Is this something you&nbsp;
can actually do now, on air

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.393
Shri Mataji: Yes, I can. I’ll&nbsp;
try. I’ll try. [soft chuckle]

00:09:08.393 --> 00:09:10.560
MOD: Okay, great. How do we do that then?

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:11.680
Shri Mataji: How?

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.840
MOD: How do we actually awaken the Kundalini?

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.360
Shri Mataji: “It’s a Ñ you want me to do it?

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.030
MOD: Ya, ya. Ya.

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:21.840
Shri Mataji: All right. I would request&nbsp;
all of you to put your hands like this

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.200
MOD: So, hands out.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.280
Shri Mataji: Out like that.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.587
MOD: With palms facing upwards.

00:09:25.587 --> 00:09:28.800
Shri Mataji: Yes. Palms relaxed, like so.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:38.347
And ah, I have to tell you one thing is to,&nbsp;
first of all, you have to forgive yourself.

00:09:38.347 --> 00:09:42.480
Is very important. You have to forgive&nbsp;
yourself. You should not feel guilty.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:46.880
Because whatever wrong you have done&nbsp;
is finished now. Why to feel guilty?

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:50.000
The second point Ãis you have to forgive everyone.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.040
That’s a very important point&nbsp;
because there’s a centre here, here Ñ

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.290
MOD: In the forehead. In the forehead. Ya.

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:57.920
Shri Mataji: on the optic chasma,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:02.080
which is very constricted and if&nbsp;
you don’t forgive, it won’t open.

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.960
So Kundalini won’t be able to pass through that.

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.680
So, you have to forgive everyone.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:12.080
Logically, if you don’t&nbsp;
forgive, you don’t do anything.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.440
Whether you forgive or don’t&nbsp;
forgive, you don’t do anything.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:19.120
But if you don’t forgive,&nbsp;
then you torture yourself.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:22.720
So, best is to forgive. Forgive everyone.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.440
Is very simple just to say, I forgive everyone.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.680
That’s all you have to say. Just to say.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:33.200
Now, put your hands towards me like that,&nbsp;
both, I mean towards your, maybe, radio.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.120
MOD: Towards your wireless, ya, ya, ya.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.240
Shri Mataji: Towards, both hands.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:42.240
Now, what you can do is to put the&nbsp;
right hand towards Me like this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:46.320
and left hand Ñ you have to put&nbsp;
on top of the fontanel bone area.

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:47.280
MOD: Right. So the left hand.

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:47.920
Shri Mataji: Above the last centre.

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:52.240
MOD: Right. The left, the left hand goes just&nbsp;
above, just above the centre parting on your head.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.400
Shri Mataji: Ya, that was the&nbsp;
soft bone in your childhood.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.253
MOD: Right.

00:10:55.253 --> 00:10:57.200
Shri Mataji: In the fontanel bone area. You see?

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.160
MOD: Right. On top of your head.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.061
Shri Mataji: Ya, just above.

00:10:59.061 --> 00:10:59.162
MOD: Right.

00:10:59.161 --> 00:11:02.240
Shri Mataji: And you put your&nbsp;
hand, not on top, but above.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:08.880
And see for yourself if there is any cool or&nbsp;
hot breeze-like thing coming, some vibrations.

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:11.533
MOD: Right. So you would you would&nbsp;
feel air, warm air or cool air ?

00:11:11.533 --> 00:11:14.320
Shri Mataji: Ya. But they are&nbsp;
vibrations that are coming in.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.440
They look like air, cool air or hot air.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.040
Little higher. All right.

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:20.480
MOD: Uuh, ya, ya.

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:26.160
Shri Mataji: Now, you put the left hand towards&nbsp;
me like this and put the right hand on top of your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.520
again, on top of your fontanelbone area.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.000
This is the actualization of baptism&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:43.280
that you really feel a cool or hot&nbsp;
breeze coming out of your own head.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:46.080
Now you can move your hand and see for yourself.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.920
If it is cool, well and good.

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:51.440
If it is hot, also all right, but&nbsp;
that means you have not forgiven,

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:55.181
you have not forgiven yourself&nbsp;
and you have not forgiven others.

00:11:55.181 --> 00:11:58.164
MOD: Not forgiven. So that means if you have&nbsp;
your hand above your head and you’re feeling hot.

00:11:58.164 --> 00:12:04.560
Shri Mataji: Ya, hot. Then you better understand&nbsp;
that you have not yet forgiven everyone.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:10.240
That’s there. So, better forgive&nbsp;
everyone, so it becomes cool again.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.880
Now, it has to be cool is the perfect state.

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:15.194
[SILENCE]

00:12:15.194 --> 00:12:20.160
MOD: So, if you feel a cool air, then&nbsp;
it means you’re in a better place than&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.280
someone who’s feeling hot air.

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:27.200
Shri Mataji: Now, I’ll blow in the mic, if you&nbsp;
don’t mind. That will have an effect, better.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:37.840
Keep the hands like that only and I’ll blow.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:45.263
[LONG SILENCE WITH SOFT BLOWING SOUND]

00:12:45.263 --> 00:12:46.240
MOD:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.840
So, what is it people we’ll&nbsp;
be feeling now at home?

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.680
Shri Mataji: It will be coming out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:53.200
Now, what you have to see is that on your&nbsp;
fingertips, also, you feel the cool breeze.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.040
On your fingertips and in the centre of&nbsp;
your palms you’ll feel the cool breeze.

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:08.560
Maybe a little bit hot you might feel&nbsp;
, if you have not forgiven yourself.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:11.120
Some may be there. You will feel it.

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:14.080
And once you feel it, you should&nbsp;
know that you are in connection&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:17.040
with this all-pervading power of Divine Love,

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.720
which is known also in the Bible.

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.760
It’s called as the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost.

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:26.160
So that’s the- you start feeling now&nbsp;
that your connection is established.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:30.080
But still, you have to grow into it&nbsp;
and there are problems within you,

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.920
so we have follow-ups and all that.

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.520
We have centres everywhere&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:37.040
where you can go and ask them and they&nbsp;
will tell you what’s wrong with you.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:41.360
That will correct you physically,&nbsp;
mentally, emotionally and also spiritually.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:44.880
MOD: And we’ll give you those&nbsp;
details in just a few moments time.

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:48.720
Keep to Liberty for more tunes, more chat&nbsp;
and more fun and more from Shri Mataji&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.680
Nirmala Devi and don’t forget to give us&nbsp;
a call if you’ve felt anything at home.

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:52.160
[SONG]

00:13:52.160 --> 00:20:41.760
MOD: And my guest today is&nbsp;
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:45.440
Shri Mataji means Mother and I have to say we’ve&nbsp;
seen from her quite an effect from ouraudience.

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:47.520
We’ve had quite a few calls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:53.280
so far from people who are experiencing the&nbsp;
cool and the warm air that you described.

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:54.640
I should explain, if anyone’s just joined us,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:58.560
that we just did an exercise&nbsp;
on the radio with Shri Mataji,

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:03.120
who is recognized worldwide for her&nbsp;
pioneering work in awakening the natural&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:06.880
healing energy that lies within every&nbsp;
human being called the Kundalini.

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:11.120
Now there’s some awakening going on.&nbsp;
What’s the next stage then, Mother?

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:15.120
Shri Mataji: Then you have to perfect&nbsp;
yourself. You have to know everything about it.

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:20.320
About a month, if you spend on this,&nbsp;
you’ll become a master yourself.

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:22.720
You can give Realization to thousands yourself.

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.120
MOD: Is it, is it really that easy though?

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:26.467
Shri Mataji: Ya, ya [soft laugh].

00:21:26.467 --> 00:21:28.240
MOD: I thought some people though

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.480
Shri Mataji: It has to be very easy,&nbsp;
isn’t it, because so important.

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:31.721
MOD: Absolutely, so more and more

00:21:31.721 --> 00:21:32.160
Shri Mataji: It’s so vital.

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:33.520
MOD: so more and more people can do it.

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:39.280
Shri Mataji: It is the last breakthrough of our&nbsp;
evolution, last breakthrough of our evolution.

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:44.640
And it has to happen to all the people.&nbsp;
The kundalini is present in all the people,

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:48.400
whether they are this&nbsp;
nationality, that nationality,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:52.000
colour, creed, religion, doesn’tmatter.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:58.560
Everybody has this power to rise above to&nbsp;
this new realm, which Einstein has described:

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:03.680
that once you get your Self Realization,&nbsp;
you jump into the torsion area he called it.

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:10.240
MOD: So, if we awaken it&nbsp;
globally, do you envision,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:13.760
in time then, where we would&nbsp;
reach, I suppose, a utopia,

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:16.560
because a lot of people might&nbsp;
say, Mother, who were listening,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:19.200
that there are so many bad&nbsp;
things going on in the world.

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:23.280
Would you argue that is because&nbsp;
that Kundalini hasn’t been awakened?

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:25.840
Shri Mataji: No, because human&nbsp;
beings are to be transformed.

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:31.600
You see, human beings have all these&nbsp;
weaknesses like greed, anger, hatred, all that.

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.000
All these things you just forget.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:40.960
They just drop out and you become a beautiful&nbsp;
personality, which loves and which enjoys.

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:43.680
MOD: And you say this is something&nbsp;
which can be awakened in all of us,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:46.880
everyone, anyone who is listening&nbsp;
has the potential to do this?

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:47.246
Shri Mataji: Ya.

00:22:47.246 --> 00:22:49.840
MOD: And you can actually&nbsp;
learn how to do it yourself.

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.752
There is an eight week series of follow-up&nbsp;
programs which you mentioned, Mother.

00:22:52.752 --> 00:22:53.440
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes.

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:57.520
MOD: Mother, in which you can learn more,&nbsp;
to practise the techniques of Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:59.920
We must stress, you don’t&nbsp;
part with any cash for this.

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:05.360
The first two of these will be held on&nbsp;
Wednesday the 14th of July at 7:30 p.m.

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:09.680
and Wednesday the 21st of July at 7:30.

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.920
They’re on at the Great Hall,&nbsp;
the Kensington Town Hall.

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:18.000
So, if you did feel anything at home or perhaps&nbsp;
you didn’t but would still like to find out more,

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.160
then you can call the Sahaja Yoga&nbsp;
information line. That’s 0181-9305621.

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:26.720
That’s 0181-9305621.

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:34.640
There are also Sahaja Yoga centres in&nbsp;
over eighty countries around the world.

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.640
Those details available&nbsp;
once again on 0181-9305621.

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:43.840
Mother, it’s been an absolute pleasure.&nbsp;
Thank you very much for joining us.

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:43.912
Shri Mataji: Thank you. Thank you very much.

00:23:43.912 --> 00:23:46.240
MOD: And the best of luck&nbsp;
with everything in the future.

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:46.827
Shri Mataji: Thank you. Thank you very much.

00:23:46.827 --> 00:23:48.120
MOD: Not at all. My pleasure entirely

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:48.320
[SONG]

00:23:48.320 --> 00:27:48.640
MOD: if you’ve felt anything, ah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:55.280
at all at home, even if you felt, ah, that&nbsp;
you didn’t feel a thing, then, ah, the Big&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:55.280 --> 00:28:00.240
Man has, ah, those details once again if you,&nbsp;
ah, fancy going along this, ah, ver ky week.

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:03.040
BIG MAN (with deep voice): “Ya,&nbsp;
there’s one this Wednesday, um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:07.120
it kicks off, they all kick off at 7:30, and&nbsp;
apparently you part with NO MONEY whatsoever –

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:10.960
and this must be why, ah, one of the reasons why&nbsp;
it’s taken so long for This to come to the fore,

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:14.240
because anything like this, if you’re parting&nbsp;
with money, they like to knock it down.

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:17.840
But they’re not asking you for any&nbsp;
money. You go along, it’s totally gratis,

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:44.160
and there’s one at Covent Gardens (tells&nbsp;
all the Sahaja Yoga programs in London).

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:53.680
And I believe there is a number, which I&nbsp;
can’t see, have you got the number there?

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:54.360
There is a number-

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:59.051
MOD: There is a number to call, which is 0181

00:28:59.051 --> 00:29:00.880
B.M.: 9305621.

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:05.760
Ah, any information that you need on Sahaja&nbsp;
Yoga, that is the information hotline.

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:11.840
And also, if you’re, ah, netted up, you&nbsp;
can point your browser at WWW.SAHAJA.ORG,

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:14.000
Sahaja spellt s.a g.h.a.j.a..

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:20.480
And I can tell you, I did feel a little&nbsp;
bit of the Breeze coming through.

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:27.303
Um, so I, I don’t know, I may have to pop&nbsp;
along, because it was a, I don’t know, peace, ah

00:29:27.303 --> 00:29:27.975
MOD: Very, very strange.

00:29:27.975 --> 00:29:29.440
B.M.: Very, very strange

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.280
MOD: Strange experience.

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:36.400
B.M.: Never have I experienced anything like,&nbsp;
like that in the whole of my life. Seriously.
