00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:14.340
So here, what happens that when the Kundalini&nbsp;
rises, when she goes to the Agnya Chakra which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.820
represents, as you say, the third eye or whatever&nbsp;
you may call it – it is between the optic chiasma,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.140
and it looks after the&nbsp;
pituitary and the pineal body.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.853
And as a result we have developed two&nbsp;
institutions called ego and superego.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.240
The ego is the one which tells us “I have done it.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.740
I am doing this."

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:45.780
Both these institutions are sucked in by the&nbsp;
enlightenment of this center and that’s how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.440
the thing opens out, and all your karmas are&nbsp;
sucked in, so there’s no problem of karmas.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.820
Only human beings think that they&nbsp;
are doing karmas; animals don’t.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.153
They have no sense of sin or anything.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.420
They are completely under the bondage of God,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.842
so in Sanskrit they are called as&nbsp;
“pashu” – means “under the bondage."

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.300
But we are the ones, we have got freedom.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.420
And that’s why we think we have done this and we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.660
have done that; and we should not&nbsp;
do this, we should not do that.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:23.640
But when the Kundalini rises and she awakens this&nbsp;
center, then both these things are sucked in.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.909
And when they are sucked in, then you do not&nbsp;
do any karmas anymore, you just are in akarma.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.300
You do everything – I mean, I travel, you&nbsp;
know, such a lot and I have a family, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:43.680
everything is there; but is just happening, I am&nbsp;
just seeing it, I am not doing anything as such.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:50.220
So when you are also awakened, there’s&nbsp;
no obligation, it’s just happening.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.120
It is&nbsp;so.

00:01:52.882 --> 00:02:02.509
It is here where we should understand that this center&nbsp;
is bestowed upon by the great life of Christ.

00:02:03.105 --> 00:02:09.602
Christ is there, and they said that He died&nbsp;
for our sins, died for our karmas – is a fact.

00:02:09.851 --> 00:02:14.627
Because when He is awakened these&nbsp;
two institutions are pulled in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.880
inside, and you get your Kundalini&nbsp;
out there – it opens out.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:28.467
And this bone which had been calcified opens&nbsp;
out, and the kundalini pierces through.
