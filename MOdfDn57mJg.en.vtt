00:10:13.968 --> 00:10:17.015
You have decided once for all.

00:10:17.015 --> 00:10:22.245
After getting married,
 I hope none of you will turn back.

00:10:22.861 --> 00:10:28.836
 Because it creates a very bad feeling

00:10:30.203 --> 00:10:42.061
and I mean, it has become something like what
is  happening with other people who are not Sahaja Yogis.

00:10:43.053 --> 00:10:46.681
It's a responsibility.

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:52.593
I know that sometimes, you start
thinking.

00:10:53.126 --> 00:11:01.312
Normally, they say that, "It was such a atmosphere that Mother, we accepted and we married".

00:11:01.805 --> 00:11:07.735
And after that, I don't know what goes wrong.

00:11:08.331 --> 00:11:14.190
So, this marriage is not a mental marriage you must
know, it's beyond mental.

00:11:14.436 --> 00:11:20.513
If you start thinking now of one thing, then after marriage
you'll start thinking of something else.

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:24.503
So, all those, even now, you have to decide.

00:11:24.708 --> 00:11:28.331
Because I have decided now, I'm so fed up
with this kind of thing,

00:11:28.459 --> 00:11:35.034
those who do such a thing for no real rhyme and reason -
actually this, I don't know why I'm doing it.

00:11:35.506 --> 00:11:40.487
Such an explanation, if you give,  then you'll have to go out of Sahaja Yoga permanently.

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:45.575
But we can't afford to have these kinds of things going on.

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:50.549
Especially, girls feel very hurt and
are shocked.

00:11:50.693 --> 00:11:57.926
If something wrong with them, if they are aggressive or they
try to get out of Sahaja Yoga or teach you something else,

00:11:58.049 --> 00:12:01.454
then I can understand.

00:12:02.624 --> 00:12:08.699
But otherwise, you should not at all,
on your own, just for no rhyme and reason,

00:12:08.699 --> 00:12:15.175
 give up the girls, because they
very sensitive and I'm also sensitive on that point.

00:12:17.134 --> 00:12:22.931
There are certain hurdles, I have seen,
because all these years we have been marrying boys

00:12:22.931 --> 00:12:26.653
and girls, from different countries.

00:12:27.187 --> 00:12:32.452
Sometimes, it happens that these girls, when they - especially Indian girls -

00:12:32.883 --> 00:12:38.942
when they go abroad, they get enamoured
 by the way you have money, the way you have comfort.

00:12:39.094 --> 00:12:44.685
And you overly try to
individualize them.

00:12:44.685 --> 00:12:50.552
It means, you pay much attention to them, not to the collective, but to them.

00:12:50.634 --> 00:12:53.946
And sometimes, they really get spoiled, I tell you.

00:12:54.028 --> 00:12:57.625
I have known some girls who have really
become horrid.

00:12:57.769 --> 00:13:00.000
So, you must keep a balance.

00:13:00.103 --> 00:13:09.692
And to approach Indian girls, has to be little gentle
not to be extremely aggressive or extremely hasty.

00:13:10.207 --> 00:13:17.878
But another bad point is this that the girls
start playing on your mind sometimes, I have me, known this.

00:13:17.878 --> 00:13:21.343
 That they want to send some money
to their parents.

00:13:21.343 --> 00:13:23.475
This should not be allowed.

00:13:23.598 --> 00:13:32.562
Or they might say that, "Let us separate. Let
us take another house and go away from ashram".

00:13:33.569 --> 00:13:38.661
This has once happened in Australia and
everybody has learned a lesson from that,

00:13:38.661 --> 00:13:45.519
because the girls were very unhappy when they separated.
You see, in the West, there are no servants nothing.

00:13:45.827 --> 00:13:48.236
You have to do all the work yourself.

00:13:48.236 --> 00:13:53.596
But in the ashram, these are collective problems
and everybody solves your problem.

00:13:53.596 --> 00:13:58.637
And you feel so independent
and so relaxed.

00:13:58.809 --> 00:14:04.262
So, here we are marrying you all only for Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:04.385 --> 00:14:08.543
And not for your whims and your ego.

00:14:09.282 --> 00:14:12.663
So, please, try to understand that if you are getting married,

00:14:12.848 --> 00:14:19.324
try to have a kind of a temperament that will suit Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:19.703 --> 00:14:23.205
Of course, you have to respect your wife,

00:14:23.205 --> 00:14:28.482
she's your housewife, she's the one who look after you. She should be your companion

00:14:29.036 --> 00:14:32.777
and she'll be kind to your parents.

00:14:32.941 --> 00:14:40.470
She has to be. But at the same time, you also have to take the responsibility

00:14:40.644 --> 00:14:44.601
and tell her whatever you want her to do.

00:14:44.683 --> 00:14:49.504
You'd better tell her that, "I would like you to behave like this, or do like this".

00:14:49.812 --> 00:14:54.004
Normally, they are very congenial and good and will accept.

00:14:54.251 --> 00:14:58.741
But sometimes, sometimes they do defy.

00:14:58.844 --> 00:15:03.230
It doesn't matter, they have got a little freedom to defy also.

00:15:03.566 --> 00:15:12.272
On major points, of course, they should not. But in minor things, you shouldn't try to dominate them.

00:15:12.594 --> 00:15:18.377
Actually, it is the question of companionship.

00:15:18.726 --> 00:15:23.680
You are companions, two wheels of one chariot.

00:15:23.913 --> 00:15:27.654
If one wheel is small it will go
round and round.

00:15:28.113 --> 00:15:32.571
And the left wheel is on the left-side and the right wheel on the right-side.

00:15:33.105 --> 00:15:37.063
It is not you can change the plate wheels.

00:15:37.205 --> 00:15:43.347
So, the left wheel has to understand its responsibility and the right wheel has to understand its own responsibility.

00:15:45.563 --> 00:15:54.006
All the time, some people have a also
bad idea of nagging, fighting.

00:15:54.183 --> 00:16:01.808
That's no companion. On the contrary, try to be gentle and nice and be friendly.

00:16:01.952 --> 00:16:08.494
But in no way spoil them to such an extent that they go against Sahaj behaviour.

00:16:08.761 --> 00:16:14.520
So far, very few, I would say 1 to 2% of marriages have failed.

00:16:14.684 --> 00:16:24.138
But I'm sorry for that, sorry, and sometimes even marrying for two, three years, then they separate.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:28.515
So, the poor children also suffer. So, this should not happen.

00:16:28.666 --> 00:16:36.335
One should try to see that Sahaja Yoga marriages are for Sahaja Yoga work and Sahaja Yoga community

00:16:36.335 --> 00:16:38.981
and for the whole universe.

00:16:38.981 --> 00:16:46.566
And the way you treat a wife and are kindly to her and bring her up -

00:16:46.936 --> 00:16:51.820
maybe she doesn't know so much of Sahaja Yoga, maybe she's not so deep as you are personally -

00:16:52.169 --> 00:16:59.490
so, try to tell her and bring her up, is a way how you handle the situation and work it out.

00:16:59.966 --> 00:17:04.786
So, I leave it to your responsibility.
And I'm sure, at this occasion,

00:17:05.053 --> 00:17:09.315
I wish you all the best for your married life.

00:17:09.671 --> 00:17:15.900
Especially for the coming New Year, all the prosperity and all the happiness.

00:17:16.167 --> 00:17:25.333
I hope you will realize that it is quite a hazardous task to select people from this country to that country.

00:17:26.483 --> 00:17:32.490
And we have tried to do it our level best.

00:17:32.654 --> 00:17:41.655
If you find something is wrong even before garlanding the girls, you can tell us and run away.

00:17:42.044 --> 00:17:49.343
We'll not say anything. But afterwards, it's not fair. It's not fair to us.

00:17:49.692 --> 00:17:54.007
Because we have been really thinking of making you happy.

00:17:54.171 --> 00:17:59.030
And for that, we have organized these marriages with all consideration.

00:17:59.215 --> 00:18:03.926
And then, you should not make us unhappy, that's not fair.

00:18:04.049 --> 00:18:11.526
So, again and again, I tell you, if you decide not to marry, you can decide now.

00:18:11.834 --> 00:18:16.241
Till you get married you can decide.

00:18:16.726 --> 00:18:23.348
I am surprised that you are all eating
outside in some of these stalls,

00:18:23.615 --> 00:18:27.375
and that's why I'm sick, because you also got sick.

00:18:27.375 --> 00:18:32.476
Why did you eat there? You have got food, everything. Why should you go to these stalls?

00:18:32.476 --> 00:18:40.216
I don't mind buying other things, but why to eat that horrible food cooked by this dirty people?

00:18:40.216 --> 00:18:43.331
And which you shouldn't have had.

00:18:43.536 --> 00:18:46.756
It's a very wrong thing.

00:18:50.115 --> 00:18:55.794
So, please, try to understand.There are very few rules to be followed in Sahaja Yoga,

00:18:55.978 --> 00:19:00.370
all for your benevolence, for your good health, for your prosperity.

00:19:00.555 --> 00:19:04.962
But you should do it and you should not try to escape it,

00:19:04.962 --> 00:19:08.844
or think that you are an individual, you'll carry your wife whatever you like.

00:19:08.986 --> 00:19:13.264
This kind of an idea, if she suggests you,
you just tell her to shut up.

00:19:13.331 --> 00:19:16.207
That's the only way we can manage things.

00:19:16.207 --> 00:19:23.118
Because we had lots of
problems from that kind of a thing that people did.

00:19:24.432 --> 00:19:27.839
May God bless you all.

00:19:28.331 --> 00:19:37.041
[Hindi]

00:19:40.544 --> 00:19:44.312
Some people have got it - little fallen down also.

00:19:49.046 --> 00:19:56.722
It's not the external beauty and all this, it's not the intelligence. It's not over education, nothing.

00:19:56.722 --> 00:20:04.509
What is good is temperament, nature and sahaj depth. That's the main thing.

04:43:42.865 --> 04:43:47.149
I'm very happy, of course,

04:43:47.474 --> 04:43:54.189
to see you all here, beautifully wedded to each other.

04:43:55.958 --> 04:44:05.481
Now you have to only know that through this
wedding, you have to create the light of love

04:44:06.385 --> 04:44:15.913
everywhere, between yourselves, between other Sahaja Yogis,  all over the world.

04:44:16.441 --> 04:44:27.796
We have to spread this love,
this Divine love, Chaitanya, it’s called Ruh, all over.

04:44:28.124 --> 04:44:30.927
You see, the whole world is in a turmoil.

04:44:31.242 --> 04:44:34.027
Every community is in trouble,

04:44:34.237 --> 04:44:40.631
and it really hurts me very much, wherever I know about it,

04:44:40.793 --> 04:44:47.377
 that for nothing at all, people are suffering even now, today, in this modern times

04:44:48.145 --> 04:44:50.744
I don't know how we have advanced.

04:44:50.872 --> 04:44:54.201
Now it is for you to be on the lookout:

04:44:54.597 --> 04:44:58.039
wherever you can help people, please try to help.

04:44:58.117 --> 04:45:00.531
Go all out to do that.

04:45:00.613 --> 04:45:06.974
Also, you must find out what's wrong with your society, what's wrong in your country.

04:45:07.102 --> 04:45:12.343
Please, try to write it down and also to study.

04:45:12.452 --> 04:45:16.532
Because we are in the collective, all right.
We are enjoying ourselves, it's heavenly here,

04:45:16.625 --> 04:45:18.304
I feel it myself.

04:45:18.620 --> 04:45:23.885
But the whole world is suffering
and we have to think about them.

04:45:24.337 --> 04:45:27.661
We have to find out how we can help them.

04:45:27.974 --> 04:45:36.541
I wish the whole world can become Sahaj
and enjoy the bliss of God almighty.

04:45:44.434 --> 04:45:50.635
I hope you are all enjoying each other

04:45:50.973 --> 04:45:53.738
and all the friends are enjoying.

04:45:54.007 --> 04:45:57.999
Only thing, one message I have to give:  just enjoy.

04:45:59.985 --> 04:46:03.308
And try to make others also enjoy.

04:46:03.562 --> 04:46:10.511
Lot of humour is needed, lot of understanding
is needed, to make your life very beautiful.

04:46:10.744 --> 04:46:15.718
No use making miserable moments, no use, there's no need.

04:46:15.914 --> 04:46:22.701
Just understand that in every moment, there is the bubbling of joy.

04:46:22.865 --> 04:46:26.787
Try to catch that and spread joy all over.

04:46:27.114 --> 04:46:33.366
God is love and God is truth. But God is joy.

04:46:33.825 --> 04:46:38.340
If you are not joyous, then it's not Divine.

04:46:38.562 --> 04:46:41.321
So, those people who go very serious,

04:46:41.426 --> 04:46:44.339
should know that they have to still laugh a lot

04:46:44.463 --> 04:46:46.118
and enjoy yourself.

04:46:46.317 --> 04:46:48.251
May God bless you. Thank you.
