WEBVTT

00:08.540 --> 00:12.270
In the most auspicious time

00:14.781 --> 00:18.187
that is called as Krita Yuga,

00:19.919 --> 00:23.603
we all have assembled here

00:25.117 --> 00:32.033
to understand the ways and methods

00:33.208 --> 00:40.957
of establishing our Principle of a Master.

00:45.638 --> 00:48.972
Krita Yuga.

01:10.703 --> 01:15.453
“Krita Yuga” means the time

01:17.098 --> 01:19.889
when you have to do something –

01:20.264 --> 01:22.555
“krita: when it was done.”

01:35.380 --> 01:39.338
So you are the channels of that doing,

01:46.248 --> 01:49.248
doing the work of God.

01:52.547 --> 01:57.274
You are the channels of God Almighty and His Power.

02:06.184 --> 02:14.225
On one side you have to carry the dignity,

02:14.654 --> 02:19.695
the glory, and the assumption that you are a guru.

02:33.291 --> 02:37.249
On the other side you have to be completely surrendered

02:37.529 --> 02:40.613
to your God Almighty.

02:49.619 --> 02:53.753
All your dignity, your authority comes from Him.

03:00.120 --> 03:02.846
And the third thing is

03:03.224 --> 03:08.433
that the way He has created this universe and you,

03:09.187 --> 03:10.250
in a mood of play,

03:15.117 --> 03:17.665
you have to see His play.

03:28.718 --> 03:34.344
So a kind of mood that is cheerfulness

03:34.650 --> 03:38.975
should be really bubbling through you.

03:48.604 --> 03:51.813
So far the idea of guru was

03:52.083 --> 03:54.882
that such a person never laughs, never smiles,

03:55.241 --> 03:57.740
always in a temper.

04:03.208 --> 04:05.124
That was all right for gurus

04:05.457 --> 04:08.838
who did not have to have any contact with the public,

04:09.109 --> 04:10.900
but hanged themselves with a string

04:11.400 --> 04:13.566
somewhere in the Himalayas.

04:21.707 --> 04:25.582
But here we are, facing

04:27.120 --> 04:32.287
the entire universe that has to receive

04:32.627 --> 04:35.585
the bubbling streams of your love.

04:46.468 --> 04:49.216
But that does not mean that you have to be frivolous,

04:49.457 --> 04:51.392
because you cannot be.

04:57.707 --> 05:00.499
The divine play is not frivolous,

05:03.208 --> 05:05.962
it is joyful,

05:06.415 --> 05:09.373
and the joy does not have that duality.

05:16.253 --> 05:22.082
So to get to the establishment of your Guru Principle,

05:22.282 --> 05:26.124
first we should know how it is destroyed.

05:39.291 --> 05:42.730
As it is, anything that is not looked after

05:42.957 --> 05:46.124
or maintained gets destroyed.

05:56.775 --> 05:58.830
If we do not pay attention,

05:59.041 --> 06:04.333
say, to these beautiful plants here, they will be destroyed.

06:12.672 --> 06:17.048
Even matter which is not attended to gets destroyed.

06:21.911 --> 06:27.494
So first of all, we have to know that we must be attentive

06:32.582 --> 06:36.374
and alert that if we do not maintain ourselves,

06:36.632 --> 06:38.160
we’ll be destroyed.

06:46.010 --> 06:49.647
Because maintenance is not for maintenance sake,

06:53.385 --> 07:00.885
it is for stopping the destruction of your Guru Principle.

07:08.797 --> 07:12.131
When we are negligent or lazy about it,

07:12.381 --> 07:16.381
we are responsible for destroying our Guru Principle.

07:24.874 --> 07:28.208
So the attention that we have

07:28.468 --> 07:33.635
is to be given to the maintenance of this Guru Principle.

07:43.457 --> 07:50.999
The gurus have the capacity to maintain themselves

07:51.333 --> 07:54.374
and maintain others.

08:02.953 --> 08:08.494
In the beginning, when the gurus tried to establish

08:08.752 --> 08:13.752
this maintenance principle,

08:14.411 --> 08:19.078
they put very, very strong rules and regulations.

08:33.087 --> 08:40.339
If you read Bible in the Levi chapter,

08:40.563 --> 08:44.075
you will find all the shariats that are described,

08:44.313 --> 08:47.299
which they are following now in Riyadh

08:47.499 --> 08:50.582
or in the Arabic countries.

09:05.373 --> 09:11.582
To maintain that principle within yourself,

09:12.336 --> 09:14.461
it’s written in such strong languages,

09:14.749 --> 09:17.193
like “Such a person who does not do this

09:17.412 --> 09:19.829
should be killed to death.

09:28.786 --> 09:32.652
Such a person does anything wrong of this kind

09:32.916 --> 09:35.624
should be killed by stoning.”

09:42.374 --> 09:45.707
That was at the very beginning, so the people now

09:46.010 --> 09:51.385
at that stage of evolution required that kind of a fear.

09:57.832 --> 10:02.499
This was not meant to in any way to insult or to harm,

10:02.737 --> 10:06.237
or to take away the freedom of human beings.

10:13.695 --> 10:18.561
But it was meant for people

10:18.832 --> 10:23.056
to give a great idea of the importance

10:23.333 --> 10:26.291
of the Principle of Guru within themselves.

10:34.437 --> 10:39.646
At that stage they used the frightening methods,

10:39.847 --> 10:45.594
I should say – horribly dangerous times.

10:51.536 --> 10:54.619
And that time people obeyed also.

11:00.139 --> 11:04.954
Then another evolutionary state took place

11:05.154 --> 11:10.219
where a stage started,

11:10.924 --> 11:14.798
people thought they must become austere,

11:15.171 --> 11:19.499
and start maintaining themselves by tremendous austerity.

11:19.722 --> 11:21.576
So it was self-projected;

11:21.776 --> 11:23.747
it was not projected towards others,

11:23.947 --> 11:26.203
but projected towards themselves.

11:37.650 --> 11:41.572
We can say that the first wave started when the Guru,

11:41.798 --> 11:47.070
the Primordial Guru said that if you don’t do this,

11:47.294 --> 11:50.008
then you will be killed.

11:50.208 --> 11:54.746
The second stage was where the disciples accepted this

11:55.038 --> 11:58.435
within themselves, and started telling themselves

11:58.635 --> 12:02.010
that if we do not do it we’ll kill ourselves.

12:20.041 --> 12:24.729
Austerity started on the basis of wisdom,

12:24.968 --> 12:26.968
and not on obstinacy.

12:33.665 --> 12:37.490
But then it became even fanaticism,

12:42.333 --> 12:44.712
so it went to one extreme.

12:49.093 --> 12:53.629
It started with the idea of maintenance.

12:53.862 --> 12:56.441
It started with the idea of maintenance.

13:02.347 --> 13:07.480
But maintenance itself became impossible,

13:07.680 --> 13:10.026
or perhaps they thought that they are not being

13:10.226 --> 13:12.654
able to maintain, they got confused,

13:12.854 --> 13:15.817
and to them rules and regulations became more important

13:16.017 --> 13:18.008
than maintenance itself.

13:30.052 --> 13:33.467
Thus you find they destroyed themselves.

13:37.468 --> 13:43.052
The wisdom or the essence of Guru Tattwa is a balance.

13:50.369 --> 13:52.963
Like when you maintain a plant,

13:53.163 --> 13:56.024
if you do not give it water, it will die.

13:56.286 --> 13:58.718
If you give it too much water, it will die.

14:03.457 --> 14:07.291
So the wisdom lies in understanding

14:08.128 --> 14:12.447
how much water should be given to the plant,

14:12.647 --> 14:15.767
so that it comes up at its best.

14:23.874 --> 14:26.953
Now this wisdom has to be achieved

14:27.153 --> 14:30.195
through your vibratory awareness.

14:35.166 --> 14:41.889
You are placed under the most fortunate circumstances,

14:42.089 --> 14:44.546
that you are realized souls

14:44.746 --> 14:49.079
before your Guru Tattwa is fully established.

15:00.896 --> 15:05.399
You have all the powers that any guru can aspire,

15:05.635 --> 15:09.820
without having the establishment of Guru Tattwa.

15:17.556 --> 15:21.697
Specially you are under the complete

15:21.903 --> 15:26.986
blanket of the clouds of your Mother’s love.

15:35.952 --> 15:40.833
But in no way Mother’s love is going to allow you

15:41.033 --> 15:43.443
to destroy your Guru Principle.

15:49.975 --> 15:55.975
As I told you that Guru Principle is a very sensitive thing,

15:56.259 --> 16:01.470
and is destroyed if you yourself do not try to maintain it.

16:12.517 --> 16:16.469
First of all, the destruction starts

16:16.669 --> 16:17.865
from the very source

16:23.109 --> 16:25.844
of our being.

16:41.946 --> 16:48.322
I mean to say that our being is created by five elements,

16:52.333 --> 16:55.374
and the five elements have a capacity

16:55.575 --> 16:57.645
all the time to get destroyed.

17:02.180 --> 17:05.930
Any one of these elements if they are not looked after,

17:06.499 --> 17:08.143
they get destroyed.

17:13.010 --> 17:15.823
That is the built-in capacity of the elements

17:16.078 --> 17:18.786
or of the matter, as you can say.

17:22.279 --> 17:26.196
So to maintain them is important.

17:29.426 --> 17:33.219
Some people have an idea that once you become a guru

17:33.449 --> 17:36.491
you need not maintain everything, it is maintained by itself.

17:46.540 --> 17:48.674
It is not.

17:48.874 --> 17:58.291
Agreed that the spirit definitely enhances the beauty

17:58.752 --> 18:01.633
and the health of these elements;

18:09.570 --> 18:14.701
but at the human level there is always a greater force

18:14.901 --> 18:16.772
that is trying to destroy it.

18:24.086 --> 18:27.768
So till we have completely become the spirit,

18:27.968 --> 18:32.917
there is always a chance of this destruction working it out.

18:44.459 --> 18:47.335
One may say, why this balance needed?

18:47.563 --> 18:51.721
And this is an important question which we

18:51.959 --> 18:56.455
should be able to answer all the people who ask us.

19:02.499 --> 19:06.749
Without the balance you cannot ascend.

19:11.374 --> 19:13.722
If you cannot ascend,

19:13.961 --> 19:17.923
what’s the use of our becoming human beings?

19:23.124 --> 19:26.849
For example, everything is God,

19:28.886 --> 19:32.161
but nobody is aware.

19:32.488 --> 19:35.612
At the human level you become aware:

19:37.665 --> 19:42.415
means everything exists, everything is there,

19:42.639 --> 19:45.298
but it is not aware.

19:52.597 --> 19:56.716
Say, there is a stone, that is also God,

19:56.950 --> 20:00.324
but it is not yet aware.

20:04.916 --> 20:09.913
Like say, this area is completely dark and we are blind.

20:15.249 --> 20:17.628
There is nothing to be seen,

20:17.889 --> 20:21.699
to be felt or experienced when you are in that condition.

20:26.582 --> 20:31.832
Actually one thinks that darkness is the truth,

20:35.082 --> 20:37.322
that ignorance is the truth.

20:39.124 --> 20:43.916
But when the sun comes up and the light comes in

20:44.249 --> 20:47.415
and your eyes open, you start seeing everything.

20:53.642 --> 20:56.154
You start becoming aware.

20:58.072 --> 21:03.363
So at human level you are aware at the highest point.

21:08.259 --> 21:10.672
Now this awareness has to become

21:10.923 --> 21:13.865
the awareness of the spirit.

21:20.870 --> 21:23.519
That has happened to you

21:25.665 --> 21:27.411
– you have felt the spirit.

21:29.026 --> 21:31.861
But the balance is not there as yet.

21:34.291 --> 21:39.882
Your Mother has pulled you out and made you that,

21:40.082 --> 21:42.947
but still there is imbalance inside.

21:53.582 --> 21:56.685
If you go slightly to the left you can be destroyed;

21:56.885 --> 21:59.718
you go to the right, you’ll be destroyed.

22:04.249 --> 22:07.233
So you have to try both the things

22:07.457 --> 22:12.230
as I have told you the methods, which I’ll explain.

22:15.954 --> 22:19.917
First of all you have to be austere with yourself.

22:22.866 --> 22:26.200
Just separate yourself from yourself.

22:29.248 --> 22:32.035
Separate yourself as a spirit,

22:32.235 --> 22:35.188
and look at your ego and superego.

22:42.282 --> 22:44.306
Now you start watching,

22:44.506 --> 22:49.009
you start watching the ego and superego.

22:51.333 --> 22:52.762
Do not maintain it

22:53.874 --> 22:56.582
– they are the destroying forces.

23:02.343 --> 23:08.748
Now when you see the play as a witness

23:09.153 --> 23:11.147
of these destroying forces,

23:11.347 --> 23:16.556
you will know how to also maintain yourself better.

23:24.585 --> 23:31.153
To separate yourself is easier when you take to austerity.

23:42.117 --> 23:45.663
The worst thing that elements have done to you

23:45.863 --> 23:48.499
is that you have formed habits,

23:52.908 --> 23:55.603
all kinds of hangs-up.

23:59.022 --> 24:01.022
Some people are fond of bathing,

24:01.252 --> 24:04.871
some people are fond of not bathing.

24:11.499 --> 24:14.684
Some people are fond of getting early in the morning,

24:15.041 --> 24:17.499
four o’clock, and singing songs and waking up everyone,

24:17.717 --> 24:22.249
and some are good at sleeping till ten o’clock.

24:32.185 --> 24:35.450
Some like very light-colored dresses,

24:35.650 --> 24:38.165
some like very loud-colored dresses.

24:43.573 --> 24:46.004
If you are English, then you want to have

24:46.204 --> 24:50.727
English-style everything, horrible insipid food!

25:01.950 --> 25:05.212
If you are French, you want to have wine, little bit.

25:10.162 --> 25:14.877
If you are Italian you want to have carbohydrates, too much.

25:20.847 --> 25:24.245
If you are Spanish, you
want to have too much fats.

25:26.780 --> 25:30.706
If you are Indians, you want to have too much of spices.

25:34.120 --> 25:37.651
So to change this habit,

25:37.851 --> 25:41.868
you have to give first of all the extremes that you like.

25:48.540 --> 25:58.110
Now if you say that “I like bland food” – bland food

26:01.499 --> 26:05.374
– then you should say “I must eat a lot of chillies.”

26:09.453 --> 26:11.872
If you say “I like pale colors,”

26:12.072 --> 26:14.731
then you wear very loud ones.

26:20.491 --> 26:23.915
Go from one extreme to another extreme, to begin with.

26:28.624 --> 26:31.556
But I’ve seen people, when they go from one extreme

26:31.772 --> 26:34.073
they get stuck up on the other side also.

26:40.888 --> 26:44.839
So we have to be in the center, not to the extremes.

26:48.916 --> 26:54.499
A man who is an avadhuta, the one who is a great master,

26:54.924 --> 27:00.809
can never be hanged up by any hangs-up.

27:08.556 --> 27:13.632
He cannot be ruled by any ideas that “I like this.”

27:19.794 --> 27:22.495
He sees beauty in the lush greenery,

27:22.695 --> 27:25.332
and he sees beauty in the trees

27:25.604 --> 27:29.272
which are devoid of any leaves.

27:37.703 --> 27:42.005
Now the trend of getting to austerity

27:42.220 --> 27:45.741
in a very funny way has started in the West.

27:51.369 --> 27:56.177
Like if you comb your hair, then you are no good;

28:00.479 --> 28:05.310
if you do not smell in the body, then you are no good;

28:09.468 --> 28:12.657
if you don’t look like a pig, you are no good.

28:17.184 --> 28:21.600
All kinds of funny sort of ideas have crawled into the mind,

28:21.810 --> 28:25.787
because they are going to the other extreme.

28:30.954 --> 28:33.563
But we have to learn from the nature.

28:33.763 --> 28:37.492
Nature dresses up itself when it has to greet the spring,

28:37.692 --> 28:39.673
and when it is the winter

28:39.873 --> 28:44.455
it just gets completely undressed, I should say,

28:44.806 --> 28:47.780
because the leaves have to go to the Mother Earth,

28:47.980 --> 28:52.479
and that the sun has to reach the Mother Earth.

29:00.548 --> 29:04.631
It is not attached to anything.

29:08.208 --> 29:12.749
Surprisingly it is much more elemental than we are;

29:16.169 --> 29:21.654
while we who are spiritual should have no attachment.

29:26.665 --> 29:29.582
But this idea is also a mental idea,

29:29.797 --> 29:32.585
which is the worst attachment.

29:40.030 --> 29:44.206
It’s a very funny attachment which makes Me laugh,

29:44.465 --> 29:46.674
that’s the biggest joker I’ve seen,

29:46.874 --> 29:49.807
that people get attached to mental ideas.

30:02.268 --> 30:06.305
It is like believing that whatever you think mentally

30:06.505 --> 30:08.400
will just happen to you.

30:14.827 --> 30:17.575
Say, for a mental person he has to go to picnic,

30:17.775 --> 30:21.331
he will mentally put in his mind he’s going to take

30:21.535 --> 30:23.927
this that, that and that.

30:30.249 --> 30:33.354
He may even open a file and write it down that

30:33.554 --> 30:37.554
“I am going to take this and this and this with me.”

30:42.158 --> 30:45.280
And when he goes to the picnic he finds he’s high and dry,

30:45.480 --> 30:47.200
because he has not taken anything with him,

30:47.400 --> 30:50.201
it’s all in the file!

30:59.408 --> 31:03.200
Your Mother is good at speaking and She speaks to you,

31:03.400 --> 31:07.696
but it should not be your mental attachment.

31:19.567 --> 31:21.344
Like “Yes, Mother says so,”

31:21.544 --> 31:25.328
and everybody discusses with such great enthusiasm,

31:25.528 --> 31:27.320
this is that; but it’s not become

31:27.544 --> 31:29.459
part and parcel of your being.

31:39.882 --> 31:43.299
But is a very common attachment nowadays,

31:43.499 --> 31:46.082
with all the people knowing about everything

31:46.282 --> 31:48.285
and having nothing.

31:54.916 --> 31:59.499
This mental attachment is to be really attacked.

32:09.180 --> 32:14.723
Becoming is seeing, becoming is experiencing;

32:16.029 --> 32:20.445
becoming is seeing, it is experiencing.

32:25.218 --> 32:27.143
Like if I have to come to this place,

32:27.343 --> 32:30.551
I must come and see it.

32:33.953 --> 32:37.328
If only I have thoughts about it and mental idea,

32:37.545 --> 32:41.503
mental picture, it is no good, I can – it’s not mine,

32:42.002 --> 32:43.669
it’s not the truth.

32:50.055 --> 32:53.946
So when you become aware, actually what happens that it,

32:54.146 --> 32:58.396
you see it yourselves – so let us see.

33:07.108 --> 33:10.025
Get out of that mental conception

33:10.308 --> 33:13.289
that you know already about it.

33:22.457 --> 33:25.049
You do not know,

33:25.249 --> 33:27.826
because what you know is just mental.

33:29.741 --> 33:33.376
That should be a part and parcel of your being.

33:39.009 --> 33:42.009
Now how to do it?

33:43.665 --> 33:45.707
Some will say that

33:45.908 --> 33:49.935
“We’ll just go on being austere about it.”

33:53.166 --> 33:56.863
Then that will become again another obsession.

33:59.253 --> 34:00.377
Some will say, “All right,

34:00.579 --> 34:04.787
Mother has said we should enjoy, so we’ll just enjoy.”

34:13.984 --> 34:16.042
How to strike the balance

34:17.392 --> 34:19.321
is the big problem,

34:21.075 --> 34:22.491
but should not be with people

34:22.723 --> 34:25.158
who have vibratory awareness.

34:29.291 --> 34:33.741
In that also you can be obsessed.

34:36.291 --> 34:39.075
I have seen people talking as if they are all

34:39.275 --> 34:41.507
great Sahaja yogis and there were no vibrations,

34:41.707 --> 34:43.809
and saying they are getting vibrations.

34:53.140 --> 34:56.389
It is so deceptive.

34:59.098 --> 35:02.306
So one has to think that we have to grow further

35:02.555 --> 35:06.851
and see more and more, and know about it.

35:13.624 --> 35:17.783
But if you then ask the French “How are you?”

35:17.983 --> 35:22.399
then under the influence of this, they’ll say like this:

35:22.613 --> 35:25.751
that means they’re always in imbalance.

35:35.699 --> 35:38.733
You ask an Englishman, he’ll say, “Don’t know.”

35:43.578 --> 35:47.525
Or they say “I know” – there’s nothing in between.

35:50.165 --> 35:52.265
Now we have to understand that

35:52.465 --> 35:55.840
we are carrying the light in our hand,

35:59.052 --> 36:01.598
and the light should not shake.

36:03.457 --> 36:05.679
We have to hold the light tight,

36:07.540 --> 36:10.436
and we should have a concentrated attention

36:10.707 --> 36:12.663
towards the maintenance of the light.

36:19.074 --> 36:23.022
And then to tell yourself that we have to see,

36:23.222 --> 36:26.382
not to just understand mentally.

36:32.958 --> 36:35.402
It’s to be actually aware;

36:37.434 --> 36:39.649
because you are complete otherwise,

36:43.026 --> 36:45.435
you are the part and parcel of the whole

36:47.089 --> 36:49.210
– you are.

36:50.343 --> 36:54.772
But only thing, that you have not yet seen that.

36:58.374 --> 37:00.420
You have mentally accepted,

37:00.620 --> 37:02.911
but you have not become that.

37:06.499 --> 37:09.277
Because mental projection comes from thought;

37:11.805 --> 37:14.396
that means you are at the level of the thought.

37:16.373 --> 37:19.096
You have to become thoughtless.

37:21.791 --> 37:24.477
But if you live on the basis of thought

37:24.677 --> 37:28.096
then you are still below the Agnya Chakra.

37:31.999 --> 37:34.923
So all the thought waves must be stopped to begin with,

37:35.123 --> 37:38.175
and should say that “All right, let us see now.”

37:46.276 --> 37:49.162
So from the Nabhi Chakra you come up

37:49.362 --> 37:51.507
to the Agnya Chakra.

37:55.646 --> 38:00.328
Then above that comes the third problem of destruction,

38:00.585 --> 38:03.038
is emotional.

38:16.457 --> 38:21.832
The emotional is a very subtle one.

38:25.738 --> 38:27.905
Like some people, Sahaja yogis,

38:28.128 --> 38:30.129
will sit down with a guitar

38:30.350 --> 38:36.541
and will start singing as if they are all lovebirds, you see!

38:49.737 --> 38:53.077
What is it? What is it?

38:53.315 --> 38:57.591
Come along. Come, come...

38:57.791 --> 39:00.666
What has happened?

39:01.741 --> 39:03.620
Why, why do you cry?

39:03.855 --> 39:06.938
Come to Me, come to Me. All right.

39:07.627 --> 39:14.586
Just take her away. She’s caught up.

39:16.260 --> 39:22.261
So the most delicate one is the emotional.

39:26.938 --> 39:33.896
This emotional one is a collectivity in a camouflage.

39:39.859 --> 39:42.197
For example, when the Sahaja yogis will meet,

39:42.397 --> 39:45.502
they’ll hug themselves, kiss each other,

39:45.702 --> 39:49.910
and will be very, very nice to each other, you see,

39:50.166 --> 39:53.484
and sit down and sing songs like hippies.

40:06.344 --> 40:12.974
Take the guitar in the hand and swing on the tune of love.

40:18.912 --> 40:23.042
This is actually Vishuddhi at the collectivity point,

40:26.166 --> 40:30.491
and that of course is very difficult to get rid of,

40:34.135 --> 40:38.581
because it gives you a very comfortable feeling.

40:42.113 --> 40:49.177
And people get confused with emotions,

40:49.551 --> 40:51.717
they think it is joy.

40:57.189 --> 41:02.272
Joy only can be achieved through complete detachment,

41:07.499 --> 41:12.834
the detachment which is ego-less and superego-less.

41:16.763 --> 41:22.471
But now, the problem that human beings start facing

41:23.083 --> 41:29.621
is the assumption that they are gurus.

41:40.859 --> 41:43.704
They start speaking about Sahaja Yoga,

41:43.904 --> 41:45.549
talking about Sahaja Yoga,

41:45.749 --> 41:48.544
and they start thinking that

41:48.794 --> 41:52.031
they have become already Shri Krishna.

42:00.791 --> 42:06.916
They have even a greater ego than

42:07.438 --> 42:11.230
the person who is

42:14.369 --> 42:18.995
actually ignorant about Sahaja Yoga.

42:29.521 --> 42:32.271
They start talking with such tremendous ego

42:32.488 --> 42:35.159
that I am Myself frightened of them:

42:35.438 --> 42:37.364
how much they know about Sahaja Yoga,

42:37.582 --> 42:40.540
I sometimes think?

42:52.487 --> 42:57.239
And they start asserting it so much that it’s frightening.

43:03.521 --> 43:07.244
All this can be also said, that

43:07.551 --> 43:10.048
they feel that protocol is not all right

43:10.248 --> 43:11.826
and there should be proper protocol,

43:12.026 --> 43:13.507
so we are looking after protocol,

43:13.707 --> 43:15.401
we are the guards of the protocol,

43:15.601 --> 43:17.568
and all these things there.

43:24.483 --> 43:27.324
Now those who are on the emotional side

43:27.589 --> 43:30.977
see the ego of others, while those who are on the ego side

43:31.177 --> 43:33.712
see the emotions of others.

43:42.083 --> 43:44.665
So one criticizes another,

43:46.832 --> 43:52.192
but they don’t see themselves that they are falling a trap

43:52.392 --> 43:54.420
into one of the extremes.

43:59.041 --> 44:04.249
So unless and until you are detached, you cannot see it.

44:12.608 --> 44:14.620
I will not say I did, committed a mistake,

44:14.820 --> 44:17.484
but it happened to be a mistake.

44:21.677 --> 44:23.817
For the first three years of Sahaja Yoga

44:24.017 --> 44:26.284
never talked of a bhoot.

44:30.426 --> 44:33.500
I thought I’ll be able to manage without that.

44:37.490 --> 44:41.237
But a lady came in Sahaja Yoga who was possessed

44:41.437 --> 44:44.628
and who tried all kinds of tantric tricks,
so I had to tell them.

44:52.627 --> 44:56.711
Now every Sahaja yogi is a bundle of bhoots!

45:01.983 --> 45:03.579
You ask any Sahaja yogi,

45:03.842 --> 45:06.981
“Why did you do it?” – “Must be a bhoot.”

45:13.294 --> 45:19.060
If you say that “How is it that you have done such a thing?”

45:19.260 --> 45:20.898
then they will say that

45:21.098 --> 45:24.690
“I do not know, it’s the bhoot who has done.”

45:30.511 --> 45:34.758
They are never there – all the bhoots are there.

45:39.859 --> 45:43.192
Now I don’t understand how to deal even as a Guru,

45:43.392 --> 45:46.559
because if My disciples are there I can tell them,

45:46.837 --> 45:50.037
but if they are bhoots, what am I to tell them?

45:56.973 --> 45:59.280
I can talk to Sahaja yogis but not to bhoots,

45:59.480 --> 46:01.313
they won’t listen to Me.

46:05.429 --> 46:07.875
So this is the greatest escape

46:08.075 --> 46:09.941
that Sahaja yogis have found now,

46:10.144 --> 46:12.673
which is the worst, which was never before.

46:19.415 --> 46:21.324
So sometimes I feel it was a mistake

46:21.524 --> 46:24.283
I introduced this word “bhoot.”

46:31.897 --> 46:34.458
They excuse themselves by just saying,

46:34.658 --> 46:37.021
“Mother, it is some negativity.”

46:44.533 --> 46:48.282
Unless and until there is something in you

46:48.483 --> 46:52.979
that contains the negativity, how can there be negativity?

46:59.208 --> 47:01.962
If you are detached, if like stone,

47:02.162 --> 47:06.398
then you cannot contain this negative water in itself, in it.

47:13.786 --> 47:15.655
You don’t become more negativity,

47:15.874 --> 47:18.274
you become more a guru.

47:24.612 --> 47:28.112
Now, when I say that you should not be negative

47:28.320 --> 47:30.178
– supposing under such circumstances

47:30.415 --> 47:32.499
you should not be a bhoot, you should be yourself

47:32.715 --> 47:35.082
– then they start feeling guilty.

47:43.491 --> 47:47.979
So all kinds of anti-guru tricks are working out.

47:52.189 --> 47:55.605
I am your Guru, and it is anti your Guru

47:55.851 --> 47:58.495
to play these tricks upon yourself.

48:03.316 --> 48:07.384
Now you will play these tricks with Me, what’s the use?

48:12.510 --> 48:14.488
You have to gain something,

48:14.688 --> 48:16.975
and you are playing trick against yourself

48:17.176 --> 48:19.412
if you are playing them against Me.

48:30.059 --> 48:32.548
You have to be more aware.

48:34.786 --> 48:37.911
You are not to be destroyed.

48:38.499 --> 48:41.817
Apart from that you have to save others.

48:45.683 --> 48:49.443
How will you do it, in case if you do not accept

48:49.643 --> 48:53.387
that it is your privilege,

48:53.673 --> 48:56.063
that it is your fortune,

48:56.275 --> 48:58.400
that you have been chosen

48:58.677 --> 49:02.951
to be the medium of God’s work?

49:17.180 --> 49:19.553
Sometimes I feel all the bhoots have come to Me

49:19.753 --> 49:21.587
for realization, and I am now going to become

49:21.885 --> 49:23.380
a bhoot Myself!

49:36.995 --> 49:41.482
“Bhoot” also means “Bhootnath”– is the name of

49:42.202 --> 49:44.639
Shri Shankara, Shri Shiva,

49:48.457 --> 49:52.842
because He gets after the bhoots all the time.

49:57.210 --> 49:59.683
But you have to be the present and not the bhoot

49:59.883 --> 50:01.357
– “bhoot” means the past.

50:05.208 --> 50:09.874
Then what is there to be known? You become.
Then you are in the present,

50:12.756 --> 50:14.505
you just start becoming,

50:15.505 --> 50:16.726
evolving,

50:18.230 --> 50:19.459
blossoming.

50:21.397 --> 50:24.171
Try to be in the present.

50:25.924 --> 50:30.156
Do not escape the present, face it.

50:31.380 --> 50:34.339
Don’t feel guilty nor blame the bhoot;

50:34.682 --> 50:37.633
both things are going to take you away from the present.

50:44.916 --> 50:50.249
Now just see the whole nature, the whole divine Power,

50:50.694 --> 50:56.409
your ardent desire of ages

50:57.396 --> 51:00.396
– everything is on your side.

51:11.293 --> 51:13.003
The time has come.

51:14.723 --> 51:16.451
You are just there.

51:19.208 --> 51:21.357
What have we to do?

51:23.700 --> 51:26.389
Just stand in the center,

51:27.965 --> 51:30.085
at the axis.

51:31.684 --> 51:34.711
Try to keep yourself at the axis,

51:36.715 --> 51:40.527
and then you just see the periphery moving, you don’t mind.

51:44.923 --> 51:48.757
When you see yourself misbehaving in any way,

51:49.015 --> 51:50.867
punish yourself.

51:53.759 --> 51:57.249
It is better that you punish than the Divine punishes you,

51:57.449 --> 51:59.525
because that’s a severe punishment.

52:05.514 --> 52:07.075
But do not feel guilty because

52:07.275 --> 52:08.488
you have not done anything wrong,

52:08.688 --> 52:10.897
it’s the bhoot which has done!

52:24.430 --> 52:27.930
So we come to the point that we should realize

52:28.174 --> 52:31.757
that we are gurus and we cannot be bhoots.

52:43.109 --> 52:47.859
We have to change our outside also, to become good gurus.

52:58.168 --> 53:02.293
For example, we have to learn good manners.

53:06.286 --> 53:09.480
Then these manners become your nature.

53:14.340 --> 53:16.795
Sometimes, people who are very fond of food,

53:16.995 --> 53:20.120
I always tell them they should fast.

53:25.169 --> 53:28.068
Whatever you are fond of, try to give up.

53:35.327 --> 53:40.661
Try to overcome your sicknesses of attachments,

53:45.582 --> 53:48.208
your habits.

53:48.638 --> 53:51.972
Once your Guru Tattwa is established,

53:52.612 --> 53:56.279
you’ll be accepted as a guru.

54:02.472 --> 54:05.305
There will not be any need for you to say

54:05.537 --> 54:08.000
that you are a guru, people will know that you are.

54:14.919 --> 54:17.335
We don’t have to then write on our foreheads

54:17.658 --> 54:19.372
that we are gurus, people will know that

54:19.695 --> 54:23.820
this is a guru walking; you can see the divinity walking,

54:24.151 --> 54:28.567
you can see the dignity walking, the glory coming up.

54:41.559 --> 54:44.412
You have to change from within,

54:46.457 --> 54:50.707
and the light of that within enlightenment

54:50.991 --> 54:53.634
will be shown outside.

55:00.756 --> 55:05.643
But it should not be a mental idea or an emotional idea,

55:05.843 --> 55:08.861
but should be the happening,

55:09.063 --> 55:12.693
the becoming, the awareness.

55:22.957 --> 55:26.208
You have to experience,

55:26.457 --> 55:30.937
through your own experimentation upon yourself.

55:37.626 --> 55:39.775
Even I do that.

55:41.329 --> 55:43.872
When I cannot reach you from one end

55:44.177 --> 55:47.510
because you are a bhoot, I reach you from the other.

55:52.843 --> 55:55.388
If somebody says he’s a bhoot,

55:55.692 --> 56:00.109
then I see that he suffers a little

56:00.765 --> 56:04.103
and faces it, the bhoot in him.

56:10.026 --> 56:13.678
For example somebody, I tell someone that

56:13.982 --> 56:17.315
“Please do this” and he forgets completely about it,

56:17.576 --> 56:20.627
and he says it is a bhoot that has done.

56:27.282 --> 56:30.048
So then he loses his purse and then I say,

56:30.248 --> 56:33.070
“The bhoot must have taken away the purse!”

56:38.882 --> 56:42.297
But I experiment with Myself.

56:45.075 --> 56:48.761
I first see how I should approach you.

56:49.030 --> 56:52.543
If it doesn’t work out I try something else

56:55.380 --> 56:57.469
within Myself,

56:57.669 --> 57:01.227
because it’s a very tricky time we are with.

57:05.723 --> 57:08.846
If we had gone according to the shariat

57:09.062 --> 57:11.354
of the chapter of Levi,

57:11.705 --> 57:15.078
all the bhoots would not have been here.

57:21.290 --> 57:24.886
Maybe no Sahaja yogis might have been left also.

57:29.406 --> 57:32.244
And this mental projection is such a common thing

57:32.453 --> 57:35.127
that it’s difficult to detach people,

57:35.375 --> 57:38.380
but only way I can play tricks with you

57:38.624 --> 57:42.731
is by experimenting Myself on you.

57:50.957 --> 57:53.780
In the same way you must play with yourself,

57:53.984 --> 58:02.567
and try to put yourself in an experimental box.

58:18.447 --> 58:22.830
Today is the day of the Guru Puja,

58:23.089 --> 58:26.957
the day when you have to worship your Guru.

58:32.745 --> 58:38.870
You are really fortunate to have a Guru which is a Mother.

58:44.235 --> 58:49.608
And My mother and guru is this Mother Earth,

58:49.903 --> 58:53.979
which teaches Me how to deal with human beings.

59:03.071 --> 59:09.439
And she’s the one who also in every stage of difficulties

59:09.650 --> 59:13.415
helps Me to correct

59:13.615 --> 59:21.943
My own methods of nirmala vidya.

59:31.863 --> 59:38.637
She has been such a kind mother and a kind guru to Me.

59:45.107 --> 59:48.572
And she’s such a soothing personality.

59:51.667 --> 59:56.710
This, all this green, though is given to her by sun as they say,

59:56.935 --> 01:00:00.893
is just to soothe us all.

01:00:05.984 --> 01:00:08.977
She wears the green upon herself,

01:00:11.148 --> 01:00:14.393
and the green is the Guru Principle.

01:00:18.745 --> 01:00:21.317
She’s the detached personality.

01:00:23.803 --> 01:00:25.447
She’s the magnetism,

01:00:26.779 --> 01:00:29.311
she attracts.

01:00:31.381 --> 01:00:37.510
When people are walking on her, she is looking after them.

01:00:42.177 --> 01:00:46.158
She creates out of her swayambus,

01:00:46.358 --> 01:00:48.671
the self

01:00:51.369 --> 01:00:53.995
– what should we say to swayambhu?

01:00:54.511 --> 01:00:57.431
– ah, yes, self-manifested stones.

01:01:04.499 --> 01:01:07.897
See, her attraction and her concern

01:01:08.121 --> 01:01:12.699
is so great that without her we would be hanging in the air.

01:01:19.669 --> 01:01:23.305
And she keeps Me to the brass tacks, as they say

01:01:23.507 --> 01:01:25.055
– to the reality.

01:01:29.889 --> 01:01:33.175
If I wanted I could be just the Spirit,

01:01:33.382 --> 01:01:36.357
and not bother about anybody else.

01:01:42.337 --> 01:01:44.893
The way she bears our sins,

01:01:45.093 --> 01:01:51.299
the way she always looks after us and nourishes us,

01:01:51.499 --> 01:01:54.735
despite our so many defects:

01:01:54.935 --> 01:01:57.808
in the same way a guru should do.

01:02:10.889 --> 01:02:13.537
She is extremely forgiving;

01:02:16.052 --> 01:02:17.761
but she explodes

01:02:21.188 --> 01:02:23.203
as an earthquake,

01:02:26.881 --> 01:02:31.089
and sometimes hot calcium

01:02:31.457 --> 01:02:33.876
and hot potassium can come out of her.

01:02:40.696 --> 01:02:44.422
She produces sulphur for you, for your cure.

01:02:47.597 --> 01:02:52.440
If England’s soil becomes vibrated,

01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:56.640
then this soil can be used for medicine.

01:03:03.222 --> 01:03:06.727
In India people use clay for medicine,

01:03:06.927 --> 01:03:08.926
for every kind of treatment.

01:03:15.301 --> 01:03:19.325
The understanding about Guru Tattwa

01:03:19.525 --> 01:03:22.098
one can have from the Mother Earth,

01:03:22.298 --> 01:03:26.881
so let us touch the Mother Earth and bow to her.

01:03:43.011 --> 01:03:46.011
May God bless you.

01:03:58.324 --> 01:04:01.866
She’s subtle!

01:04:19.944 --> 01:04:25.492
In the Kundalini Shastra, Mother Earth is the Kundalini.

01:04:36.511 --> 01:04:40.845
Mooladhara is the, is the Mother Earth.

01:04:45.347 --> 01:04:50.456
So for us kundalini is the most important thing.

01:04:53.065 --> 01:04:59.157
We don’t have to worry about what they have talked about

01:04:59.357 --> 01:05:04.640
in the Levi, that you must not steal, you must not tell lies;

01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:09.715
what we have to worry that keep your kundalini up.

01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:26.913
So the guru has to be a person who is absolutely practical.

01:05:31.145 --> 01:05:34.769
He must have common sense and absolutely practical,

01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:36.952
he cannot be impractical person.

01:05:40.268 --> 01:05:44.177
A person who’s impractical is not a guru.

01:05:47.016 --> 01:05:51.727
But practical in the common way is understood as a man

01:05:51.927 --> 01:05:55.173
who is cunning, who know how to deviate from right path

01:05:55.373 --> 01:05:59.665
and all that – that’s the most unpractical thing to do.

01:06:08.599 --> 01:06:11.921
Something absurd, something out of the blue

01:06:12.152 --> 01:06:15.527
is not the way a guru has to move.

01:06:21.094 --> 01:06:24.376
There is all common sense which should

01:06:24.615 --> 01:06:28.615
guide a guru how to deal with a person,

01:06:36.286 --> 01:06:40.127
and common sense is a thing which is not

01:06:40.402 --> 01:06:44.331
cunningness by any chance.

01:06:49.559 --> 01:06:52.695
The source of common sense is the spirit.

01:06:57.065 --> 01:07:03.148
The expression of a guru is very, very

01:07:05.495 --> 01:07:09.206
paradoxical – paradoxical.

01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:17.364
For example, a guru will be extremely practical,

01:07:17.564 --> 01:07:20.120
supposing he has to build his own house,

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:24.565
or a house or ashram or anything – be extremely practical.

01:07:29.305 --> 01:07:32.082
He will be very economical,

01:07:32.282 --> 01:07:35.295
he will create something out of the blue;

01:07:35.495 --> 01:07:38.356
people will be amazed how he’s done it so practical.

01:07:41.624 --> 01:07:44.277
But he’ll be so detached

01:07:44.477 --> 01:07:48.079
that if this ashram is to be donated to somebody,

01:07:48.279 --> 01:07:50.157
in one second he’ll donate.

01:07:58.654 --> 01:08:02.654
For acquiring – say, for example, for acquiring a lamp,

01:08:02.854 --> 01:08:04.887
the guru will be very practical,

01:08:05.087 --> 01:08:10.166
he’ll get the best and the cheapest and the most beautiful.

01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:20.922
And he’ll be very intense about it.

01:08:23.203 --> 01:08:24.879
But when it will come to giving,

01:08:25.079 --> 01:08:27.067
he’ll be more intense about it;

01:08:32.192 --> 01:08:35.381
that when he will give, he’ll give with that same intensity.

01:08:37.097 --> 01:08:39.751
He’ll find out all practical methods how to donate,

01:08:39.951 --> 01:08:42.478
also to give away.

01:08:46.914 --> 01:08:51.508
So his acquiring is actually giving.

01:08:56.499 --> 01:08:58.644
He acquires to give,

01:09:00.283 --> 01:09:03.282
that’s how he is the most practical.

01:09:06.370 --> 01:09:11.120
You know that we cannot take anything with us.

01:09:17.957 --> 01:09:21.858
Only the guru can take with him something,

01:09:25.390 --> 01:09:27.212
nobody else can take.

01:09:30.197 --> 01:09:35.569
Only the guru has all the disciples and disciples,

01:09:35.769 --> 01:09:40.003
and disciples and disciples for ages,

01:09:40.203 --> 01:09:42.528
who sing the praise.

01:09:52.026 --> 01:09:56.087
No other relationship is that eternal.

01:09:59.506 --> 01:10:03.590
It goes on reflecting for ages and ages and ages.

01:10:07.479 --> 01:10:11.521
It’s one wave that falls and then disappears;

01:10:11.796 --> 01:10:16.060
in anything that you do every wave has disappears,

01:10:16.260 --> 01:10:20.552
but not the wave of knowledge from a guru.

01:10:26.287 --> 01:10:33.705
It’s even higher than the Divine Principle,

01:10:38.007 --> 01:10:41.224
because it explains.

01:10:46.923 --> 01:10:49.417
The Divine Principle cannot explain

01:10:51.953 --> 01:10:54.329
– it’s the guru who explains it.

01:10:57.646 --> 01:11:00.979
Not that it manifests, but it’s explains and it works out,

01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:05.741
so he’s the master of the Divine Power.

01:11:11.831 --> 01:11:17.378
So in a way, Divine Power is like the meaning of the guru.

01:11:22.565 --> 01:11:25.321
Like the word has the meaning,

01:11:25.521 --> 01:11:29.664
and the word – I’m sorry, the word has the meaning,

01:11:29.888 --> 01:11:33.029
and the word serves the meaning.

01:11:38.038 --> 01:11:44.702
But in a Guru Principle, the Divine serves the guru.

01:11:52.532 --> 01:11:56.116
Everything is at your disposal.

01:11:57.267 --> 01:11:59.437
Everything is at your disposal.

01:12:02.247 --> 01:12:03.894
When you are a guru,

01:12:04.895 --> 01:12:06.447
all your chakras

01:12:08.223 --> 01:12:09.801
are at your disposal.

01:12:11.208 --> 01:12:13.564
All the universe is at your disposal,

01:12:14.791 --> 01:12:16.128
because you are the guru.

01:12:17.027 --> 01:12:19.665
It’s like the director of the show

01:12:24.353 --> 01:12:26.400
– the stage man,

01:12:26.608 --> 01:12:28.536
the gentleman who is in charge of the lights,

01:12:28.832 --> 01:12:30.957
the gentleman who is in charge of the loud-speaker,

01:12:31.157 --> 01:12:34.009
everybody has to serve the director,

01:12:42.525 --> 01:12:45.631
because he is training the actors.

01:12:48.385 --> 01:12:55.635
But the Guru Principle has to be so much unchallenged.

01:12:55.961 --> 01:12:57.769
It should be of such a capacity

01:12:57.969 --> 01:13:00.057
that nobody can challenge that,

01:13:00.265 --> 01:13:03.841
it should be such a capable personality

01:13:04.062 --> 01:13:07.566
that nobody should be able to challenge the guru.

01:13:07.771 --> 01:13:10.290
Then only it will work out.

01:13:22.764 --> 01:13:24.947
So you have to work it out in such a way

01:13:25.147 --> 01:13:28.610
that you are absolutely unchallengeable.

01:13:32.121 --> 01:13:36.132
And you are specially fortunate

01:13:36.332 --> 01:13:39.999
that you can see yourself and correct yourself,

01:13:40.265 --> 01:13:44.014
which nobody could do before – you are your own guru.

01:13:52.139 --> 01:13:55.882
This situation never, never happened.

01:13:59.531 --> 01:14:01.828
You are your own guru

01:14:03.728 --> 01:14:06.771
– and let Me be your Mother.

01:14:08.958 --> 01:14:13.125
That would be the best for Me.

01:14:17.444 --> 01:14:22.194
So today is the day when one has to determine

01:14:24.431 --> 01:14:30.140
how far you are a guru, first point.

01:14:31.208 --> 01:14:34.958
You have to take a pledge

01:14:35.371 --> 01:14:39.121
that you will establish your Guru Principle,

01:14:40.585 --> 01:14:42.918
second point.

01:14:43.300 --> 01:14:47.161
Thirdly, you have to pledge that

01:14:47.835 --> 01:14:53.009
you will establish Guru Principles in others.

01:15:15.148 --> 01:15:22.271
Fourthly, you have to know that there is a little snag,

01:15:22.976 --> 01:15:26.225
that your Guru is a Mother.

01:15:29.866 --> 01:15:32.461
She’s too kind to be a guru,

01:15:34.567 --> 01:15:36.970
too mild to be a guru,

01:15:38.692 --> 01:15:40.856
and extremely tolerant.

01:15:43.179 --> 01:15:46.286
So it is better that you take up this strictness

01:15:46.486 --> 01:15:49.847
towards yourself, and look after yourself.

01:15:54.446 --> 01:15:57.846
May God bless you.

01:16:01.987 --> 01:16:04.882
So you become your own guru.

01:16:18.491 --> 01:16:22.825
On every Guru day I have a problem,

01:16:23.916 --> 01:16:28.290
and one of the problems is – you may translate, Gregoire,

01:16:28.570 --> 01:16:31.862
still a little more, if you don’t mind

01:16:37.478 --> 01:16:40.645
– on every Guru Puja day I think I should become

01:16:40.848 --> 01:16:44.514
a complete Guru, and at least on one day

01:16:44.737 --> 01:16:47.612
I should not be a Mother.

01:16:55.152 --> 01:17:00.214
But every time I try these tricks it works against Me!

01:17:08.556 --> 01:17:11.389
Last year in India I told them that

01:17:11.620 --> 01:17:13.298
“This time I am going to be just Guru,

01:17:13.498 --> 01:17:15.977
and you have to only give Me a shawl

01:17:16.222 --> 01:17:20.614
and I will not take any sari, and nothing like a Mother.”

01:17:28.427 --> 01:17:30.871
And I was very stern with them, and I said,

01:17:31.071 --> 01:17:34.688
“At any cost I am not going to take a sari, whatever you may do.”

01:17:39.022 --> 01:17:41.522
And they were very unhappy because they had bought

01:17:41.802 --> 01:17:43.738
a sari for Me, and they said,

01:17:43.938 --> 01:17:45.854
“We have also stitched a blouse and a petticoat,

01:17:46.115 --> 01:17:49.597
and Mother, You must accept. You are our Mother also.”

01:18:01.147 --> 01:18:04.147
So I said, “I am going to be very hard like a guru,

01:18:04.392 --> 01:18:08.214
and nothing doing, today nothing is going to convince Me.”

01:18:17.056 --> 01:18:18.699
Because again you become the Mother,

01:18:18.899 --> 01:18:22.941
then the whole thing becomes again that soft business!

01:18:28.433 --> 01:18:31.777
[Yogi: Mother, I can’t translate that!]

01:18:33.079 --> 01:18:34.396
You’d better tell them!

01:18:42.651 --> 01:18:49.026
So I went to open the, you see, a tap

01:18:49.260 --> 01:18:51.996
– because in India we don’t believe in wash-basins,

01:18:52.196 --> 01:18:54.212
you see – to wash My hands.

01:19:07.449 --> 01:19:09.655
And Indian taps as they are, you see,

01:19:09.855 --> 01:19:14.231
it gave in and I got completely drenched.

01:19:20.517 --> 01:19:22.133
And I came out and I said,

01:19:22.333 --> 01:19:25.942
“Please give Me the sari to wear!”

01:19:39.990 --> 01:19:42.580
Today I had decided to be a real guru,

01:19:42.780 --> 01:19:45.697
and a very hard one.

01:19:55.538 --> 01:19:57.238
Then Warren came to say that

01:19:57.438 --> 01:19:59.465
“Mother, somebody has bought a sari,

01:19:59.665 --> 01:20:01.785
and this is that and that is that.”

01:20:02.006 --> 01:20:04.614
He gave lots of arguments.

01:20:12.346 --> 01:20:16.508
And Rustom and Warren were trying to, you see,

01:20:16.708 --> 01:20:19.739
put Me down in My place.

01:20:26.465 --> 01:20:33.465
But then they used the greatest argument to outwit Me.

01:20:39.363 --> 01:20:41.822
First they said, “The sari is beautiful,” this, that

01:20:42.041 --> 01:20:44.328
– I was all right then.

01:20:47.621 --> 01:20:50.091
But then they said, “The vibrations are too good.

01:20:50.291 --> 01:20:53.800
Even before opening the sari, the vibrations were there.”

01:21:00.745 --> 01:21:04.204
So all My efforts fizzled out!

01:21:08.700 --> 01:21:13.700
This is the play of the sweetness of Divine,

01:21:20.020 --> 01:21:23.026
what is called as madhurya.

01:21:25.884 --> 01:21:30.342
“Madhurya” means the sweetness, the sweetness.

01:21:30.895 --> 01:21:34.916
And this is the one

01:21:36.004 --> 01:21:40.533
that’s such a hide-and-seek of joy in life,

01:21:46.684 --> 01:21:49.140
and that is what I have accepted.

01:21:49.340 --> 01:21:53.224
So first we’ll have the Mother’s Puja.
