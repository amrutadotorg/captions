00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.200
Today is a day, when I should be talking about Sahasrara.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.720
Because tomorrow is the day of Sahasrara

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:24.280
and that is the greatest blessing of
Sahaja Yoga after Christís advent.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.760
Even if He had sucked your sins,

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.680
you are to be given realisation.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.880
Without realisation

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.840
it has no meaning

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.000
and so this Sahaja Yoga

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.480
which is todays ëMahaYogaí

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.920
came into being because you all have to be realised.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.440
You have to know yourself.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.720
The Self that is the Spirit,

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.680
that is the only way we can know God.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.760
There is no other way

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.320
that we can know God.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.680
We have to be our Spirit.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.280
The second thing that we

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.560
in all the Christian nations have done is to forget our Spirit.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.360
It is a double catch. If the ego develops, it covers your heart.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.920
You can even become emotionless.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.400
When it covers your heart,

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.840
then your heart becomes like a stone

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.880
and the Spirit does not shine.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.480
All the time what you have to say,

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.200
that "Iím the Spirit!"

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.320
All the realised souls have to say: ìIím the Spirit.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.239
Iím not this body, not this mind,

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.480
nor this superego, none of these ëuphadisí as the call them,

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.480
but Iím the Spirit, the pure Spirit I am.î

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.160
If you could recognise that part in you, that you are the Spirit,

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.280
your realisation will be fully established.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.480
As long as you are identified with other things,

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.440
this cannot be established.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.640
So first and foremost thing you have to recognise

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.760
that you are the Spirit.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.840
You are not the thoughts which are overcrowding you.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.560
You are not

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.600
the fears with which you suffer,

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.920
you are not the ambitions with which you run,

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.440
but you are that pure Spirit,

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.520
which never changes, which is eternal,

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.720
which is blissful,

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.160
which is Sat-Chit-Anand.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.360
We all Sahaja Yogis have to know, that we are the Spirit.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.040
This is the mantra that one has to recite for heart catch.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.240
If your heart is not clean,

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.400
you can never get realisation.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.360
Anybody who comes with funny ideas about Me you have seen,

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.440
he never gets realisation.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.880
You have to have clean heart.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.960
You have to cleanse your heart, thatís why I sometimes say

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.640
that you have to put your guru into
your heart, who will clean your heart.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.440
Just to clean your heart,

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.560
as you employ a maid in the house,

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.160
to clean your heart you can employ your mother for that purpose.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.600
Cleansing is my job, morning till evening Iím cleansing.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.760
Thatís my name means also.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.600
But cleansing is such a big thing, such a big thing

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.080
that, that brings forth everything else with it.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.400
If there is dust on the diamond,

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.800
on any diamond which will be very expensive, you cannot see it!

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.520
In the same way if your Spirit is clouded

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.120
with doubts and fears,

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.080
cunningness,

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.480
then your Spirit cannot shine.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.880
Now, it is such a vicious circle

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.600
that it is not easy to break.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.960
Even there your mind can cheat you.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.520
For Sahaja Yogi it is very easy, is to sit before My photograph,

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.120
put your left hand here and one
on your heart and say: Iím the Spirit.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.040
Mother, I'm the Spirit.

00:05:33.327 --> 00:05:37.287
Now, Sahasrara breaking took place

00:05:39.127 --> 00:05:41.967
on the 5th of May 1970.

00:05:46.647 --> 00:05:48.847
I was just pushed into it.

00:05:50.487 --> 00:05:53.247
Then I said one has to now break it.

00:05:57.767 --> 00:06:02.927
And if you see a very thin line of Kundalini

00:06:03.567 --> 00:06:07.087
really breaks the Sahasrara through the heart chakra.

00:06:07.767 --> 00:06:09.447
Here is the heart chakra.

00:06:09.967 --> 00:06:14.487
Through the heart chakra point only
it breaks. If your heart is not clean,

00:06:15.047 --> 00:06:16.727
it will not break.

00:06:19.447 --> 00:06:21.967
So the first and the foremost thing

00:06:22.167 --> 00:06:24.807
is your Shiva Tattwa, is your heart.

00:06:25.607 --> 00:06:29.167
Heart must be kept absolutely clean.

00:06:29.807 --> 00:06:31.927
There should be nothing,

00:06:32.927 --> 00:06:34.567
that is doubting,

00:06:35.487 --> 00:06:37.087
that is confused,

00:06:38.487 --> 00:06:39.927
that is angry,

00:06:40.127 --> 00:06:41.767
that is ambitious,

00:06:43.126 --> 00:06:45.053
that is afraid of;

00:06:45.207 --> 00:06:47.727
nothing of that kind should be in the heart.

00:06:47.927 --> 00:06:51.247
Just be confident.

00:06:53.927 --> 00:06:56.687
Just leave it into the hands of God.

00:07:02.847 --> 00:07:06.407
Because that is the point where the Kundalini breaks it

00:07:06.727 --> 00:07:09.167
and if that point is heavy,

00:07:09.527 --> 00:07:12.207
you can never break the Sahasrara.

00:07:13.313 --> 00:07:17.073
But the main thing is you have
come to ask for something so great.

00:07:17.273 --> 00:07:20.353
You have to be, have a heart which is humble,

00:07:21.873 --> 00:07:23.113
steadfast

00:07:24.593 --> 00:07:26.993
and also proud of it self.

00:07:28.273 --> 00:07:33.513
Because in this heart is the Spirit
which is going to be enshrined.

00:07:36.873 --> 00:07:39.793
Now what do I do about your realisation.

00:07:41.153 --> 00:07:43.113
My heart is very pure,

00:07:43.553 --> 00:07:44.993
absolute purity.

00:07:45.993 --> 00:07:49.193
There is not even the slightest ripple

00:07:50.793 --> 00:07:53.033
of anything else but love for you.

00:07:53.233 --> 00:07:55.673
Even if I get angry it is out of love.

00:07:55.873 --> 00:08:00.993
Even if I say something sometimes harshly, it is out of love,

00:08:01.193 --> 00:08:03.433
to keep you out of troubles.

00:08:07.073 --> 00:08:10.993
But, in my heart there is nothing but pure love, pure love.

00:08:12.833 --> 00:08:16.953
And this pure love is the pure Vidya, is the pure knowledge.

00:08:17.353 --> 00:08:19.593
Is the pure knowledge, is pure Vidya.

00:08:19.793 --> 00:08:22.873
The complete technique of purity it knows.

00:08:23.393 --> 00:08:25.633
How does the water purify you?

00:08:25.833 --> 00:08:29.633
Do you know the technique what the water does to you?

00:08:30.513 --> 00:08:34.233
The complete technique of purity resides

00:08:36.033 --> 00:08:37.193
in the heart

00:08:39.833 --> 00:08:43.313
and how do I give you realisation

00:08:43.593 --> 00:08:45.313
is to put you in my heart.

00:08:45.513 --> 00:08:47.313
Bathe you there nicely.

00:08:47.753 --> 00:08:49.553
Have you seen crocodiles?

00:08:55.433 --> 00:08:58.753
Crocodiles have; are very ferocious;

00:09:00.473 --> 00:09:04.806
but when they hatch their eggs,
they take all little, little crocodiles

00:09:04.887 --> 00:09:06.473
in their big mouth, you see,

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:10.800
and you should see the eyes of the crocodile, as is full of love

00:09:10.993 --> 00:09:12.193
and all such...

00:09:15.033 --> 00:09:16.713
as the children hatch.

00:09:17.193 --> 00:09:20.433
And the crocodile then put the mouth inside the water

00:09:20.633 --> 00:09:23.033
and cleanses them like this.

00:09:25.633 --> 00:09:29.193
First thing I do is to give you birth in my heart

00:09:29.913 --> 00:09:32.753
and then cleanse you there in my heart,

00:09:35.473 --> 00:09:38.273
and then take you

00:09:39.553 --> 00:09:43.273
through my Sahasrara. I give you your second birth.
