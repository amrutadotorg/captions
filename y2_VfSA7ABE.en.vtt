00:00:21.561 --> 00:00:24.273
… in life.

00:00:24.474 --> 00:00:31.422
In the same way the vibrations, the
vibrations are coming, they are radiated.

00:00:31.623 --> 00:00:33.817
What you have to do is to expose yourself
to it.

00:00:34.018 --> 00:00:37.751
The best way is not to put in any effort.

00:00:37.967 --> 00:00:40.518
Don’t worry at what point you have
a problem.

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:42.733
Say, many people during meditation,
I have seen

00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:46.494
if they catch somewhere they go on looking
after it.

00:00:46.695 --> 00:00:50.060
You just don’t have to worry. You just let
it go

00:00:50.261 --> 00:00:54.075
and it will work by itself.

00:00:54.794 --> 00:00:57.762
It’s very easy.

00:01:09.984 --> 00:01:13.261
So you don’t have to put in any effort.

00:01:13.462 --> 00:01:15.336
This is what meditation is.

00:01:15.544 --> 00:01:21.251
Meditation means exposing yourself
to God’s grace.

00:01:21.452 --> 00:01:24.718
Now the grace itself knows how to cure you.

00:01:24.919 --> 00:01:30.487
It knows how to mend you, how to settle
down itself into your own being,

00:01:30.688 --> 00:01:36.429
keep your Spirit kindled. It knows
everything.

00:01:37.532 --> 00:01:42.626
So you don’t have to worry as to what
you have to do

00:01:42.827 --> 00:01:45.899
or what name you have to take, what mantras
you have to do.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.147
In meditation you have to be absolutely
effortless,

00:01:49.348 --> 00:01:54.103
[aside: “Sit down”], expose yourself fully

00:01:54.304 --> 00:01:59.961
and you have to be absolutely thoughtless
at that time.

00:02:00.161 --> 00:02:04.442
Supposing there’s a possibility, you may
not be thoughtless.

00:02:04.643 --> 00:02:06.980
At that time you have to just watch
your thoughts,

00:02:07.181 --> 00:02:09.304
but don’t get involved into them.

00:02:09.505 --> 00:02:15.359
You will find gradually as the sun rises,
the darkness goes away

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.760
and the sun’s rays go into every crevice
and every part

00:02:19.961 --> 00:02:24.216
and makes the whole place lighted.

00:02:24.417 --> 00:02:27.633
In the same way your being will be
completely lighted.

00:02:27.834 --> 00:02:30.051
But if you put in an effort that time

00:02:30.251 --> 00:02:32.438
or try to stop something within you

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:35.998
or try to give it a bandhan
it will know.

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:41.015
Effortlessness is the only way
to meditation,

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.819
but you should not be lethargic about it –

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.821
should be alert and watch it.

00:02:47.022 --> 00:02:49.624
The other side could be people just
doze off.

00:02:49.825 --> 00:02:54.120
No! You have to be alert. If you doze off,
nothing will work.

00:02:54.321 --> 00:03:00.471
That’s another side of it is. If you are
lazy about it, nothing will work.

00:03:01.071 --> 00:03:08.843
You have to be alert and opened, absolutely
aware,

00:03:09.044 --> 00:03:13.809
completely effortless – absolutely
effortless.

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.490
If you are absolutely effortless,
meditation will work the best.

00:03:19.691 --> 00:03:22.253
Don’t think of your problems at all,

00:03:22.454 --> 00:03:25.159
whatever chakras you have, anything.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.188
Just expose yourself.

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:32.780
See when the sun shines, all the nature
exposes itself to the sun

00:03:32.981 --> 00:03:36.141
and receives the blessings of the sun,
effortlessly.

00:03:36.342 --> 00:03:40.427
It doesn’t put in any effort, it just
receives itself.

00:03:40.628 --> 00:03:49.436
When it receives the sun’s rays, then the
sun’s ray’s start acting and activating.

00:03:52.322 --> 00:03:59.932
So, the same way, the All-Pervading Power
starts working.

00:04:00.133 --> 00:04:03.743
You are not to manoeuvre it. You are not
to do anything about it.

00:04:03.944 --> 00:04:08.329
Just be effortless, absolutely effortless.

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.340
Don’t take any names. Do not bother
if your Agnya is catching,

00:04:12.541 --> 00:04:15.964
this is catching, that is catching. It is
working out.

00:04:16.165 --> 00:04:20.900
It will go on working as long as it can

00:04:21.101 --> 00:04:28.248
and it will do the miracle that it has
to do. You don’t have to worry about it.

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:29.869
It knows its job.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.302
But when you put in an effort actually
you create a barrier for it.

00:04:34.502 --> 00:04:36.753
So no effort is needed,

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:38.924
be absolutely effortless and say

00:04:39.124 --> 00:04:43.327
‘Let it go, let it go’ – that’s all.

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.319
No mantra’s to be chanted,

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.277
in case you find it’s impossible – then
you can take my name,

00:04:48.478 --> 00:04:49.993
but there is no need even.

00:04:50.194 --> 00:04:52.094
When you put your hand towards me
that’s the mantra,

00:04:52.295 --> 00:04:56.197
sufficient, this gesture itself is
the mantra.

00:04:56.398 --> 00:05:03.565
You see there’s no need to say it more, but
the thought in the mind, the emotion

00:05:03.766 --> 00:05:08.894
should be that we have to now spread our
hands to that and it should work.

00:05:09.095 --> 00:05:14.250
When this emotion is absolutely complete,

00:05:14.741 --> 00:05:19.722
there is no need to say any mantra,
you go beyond it.

00:05:21.053 --> 00:05:23.492
So, one has to be absolutely effortless,

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:29.305
absolutely effortless. That is what it is.

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:41.126
Meditation is for your own ascent,

00:05:41.327 --> 00:05:46.395
is for your own capital gains that you
have to have.

00:05:46.596 --> 00:05:51.450
But once you get into it, you also achieve
your powers.

00:05:51.651 --> 00:05:56.313
Like, you become a governor then you get
the powers of the governor.

00:05:56.514 --> 00:06:00.273
At this time you don’t have to think about
anybody else.

00:06:00.474 --> 00:06:03.380
You are not to put your attention
to anybody else

00:06:03.581 --> 00:06:07.717
but just receive it, just receive it.

00:06:07.926 --> 00:06:10.514
Do not think of any other problem,

00:06:10.715 --> 00:06:18.548
but that, that you have to be effortless,
absolutely effortless.

00:06:23.761 --> 00:06:30.815
It would work best on the people who are
just receiving it.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.802
You have problems – that’s why you are
here,

00:06:34.003 --> 00:06:39.161
but you cannot solve them, they are to be
solved by Divine Power.

00:06:39.362 --> 00:06:44.646
This must be understood fully, that we
cannot solve our problems.

00:06:44.847 --> 00:06:52.187
It is beyond us to solve our problems.

00:06:52.388 --> 00:06:58.048
So leave it in the hands of the Divine
Power

00:06:58.249 --> 00:07:04.094
and expose yourself effortlessly,
absolutely effortlessly.

00:07:04.295 --> 00:07:10.006
Sit in comfort, and properly with both
the feet on the ground,

00:07:10.207 --> 00:07:14.416
with both the hands relaxed like this.

00:07:14.617 --> 00:07:17.617
Be comfortable, you should not be
uncomfortable at all.

00:07:17.818 --> 00:07:23.560
Be very comfortable, you see, because you
have to sit for quite some time.

00:07:24.218 --> 00:07:26.177
Alright, good.

00:07:26.378 --> 00:07:29.534
And you try to put your attention to me,
within yourself,

00:07:29.735 --> 00:07:32.744
if you can, to my Kundalini if you can.

00:07:32.945 --> 00:07:36.687
You can come into my Kundalini and it will
be done.

00:07:36.888 --> 00:07:41.168
Good, just like this, the hands should be
like this, straight.

00:07:47.613 --> 00:07:52.452
So effortlessness is the key word,
absolutely effortlessly,

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:58.672
whether you are meditating before me,
or before my photograph.
