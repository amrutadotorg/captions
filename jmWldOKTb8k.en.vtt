01:20.560 --> 01:27.100
Today, we are celebrating the birth of Jesus
Christ.

01:35.660 --> 01:50.240
The birth of Jesus Christ is very symbolic,
because

01:50.240 --> 02:01.060
he was born
in such a manner that even the poorest of

02:01.060 --> 02:07.490
poor won’t be born in the stable.

02:07.490 --> 02:32.590
And he was put in the
bed which was made of dried grass.

02:32.590 --> 02:49.620
He came on this earth to show people that
for a person who is an incarnation or who

02:49.620 --> 03:09.349
is a highly evolved soul, is not bothered
about the comfort of the body.

03:09.349 --> 03:32.460
His message was so great and so deep, but
he had disciples who were not prepared for

03:32.460 --> 03:37.159
the battle they had to fight.

03:37.159 --> 03:42.230
Is the same thing that sometimes happens with
Sahaja Yoga.

03:42.230 --> 03:59.959
He had only 12 disciples, we too have 12 types
of Sahaja Yogis, and all of them, though [they]

03:59.959 --> 04:09.790
try to dedicate themselves to Christ, fell
a trap, some of them, to the worldly aspirations

04:09.790 --> 04:22.569
or to their own hankerings.

04:22.569 --> 04:32.110
His message of love and forgiveness is the
same even today.

04:32.110 --> 04:40.689
Preached by all, all the saints, all the incarnations,
all the prophets.

04:40.689 --> 04:49.580
They all have said about love and forgiveness.

04:49.580 --> 05:19.530
If it was challenged or people felt that this
won’t work out, they were asked to have

05:19.530 --> 05:27.210
faith in what he said.

05:27.210 --> 05:37.729
But they were simple people in those days
so they obeyed him.

05:37.729 --> 05:47.749
Some of them definitely were very good, some
of them half-baked and few of them were people

05:47.749 --> 05:54.960
who were doubting.

05:54.960 --> 06:08.960
He came on this earth to prepare for us our
Agya chakra and despite all his efforts one

06:08.960 --> 06:18.060
finds very difficult and the people who follow
Christianity have the worst type of Agya.

06:18.060 --> 06:22.649
Worst type!

06:22.649 --> 06:28.539
Extremely aggressive, extremely planning type,
futuristic.

06:28.539 --> 06:42.479
I mean all the troubles of the right side
are found in those countries who claim to

06:42.479 --> 06:47.680
be Christians.

06:47.680 --> 06:53.569
Even the early Christians who were Gnostics,
‘gne’, ‘gne’ in Sanskrit means ‘know’,

06:53.569 --> 07:02.389
though [they] had the knowledge, the beginners
were also suppressed and tortured by the people

07:02.389 --> 07:09.330
who were supposed to be in charge of Christian
religion.

07:09.330 --> 07:16.679
And so many Christians were massacred by the
so-called Christian priests and Christian

07:16.679 --> 07:24.199
churches, and still it is going on.

07:24.199 --> 07:37.860
What you find in the west is a great influence
of these churches on the minds of the people.

07:37.860 --> 07:43.809
Otherwise they are supposed to be intellectuals,
otherwise they are supposed to be analytical,

07:43.809 --> 07:47.389
otherwise they are supposed to be something
very brainy.

07:47.389 --> 07:55.939
But when it comes to temples and churches,
when it come to religion, when it comes to

07:55.939 --> 08:05.929
Christianity, I think their brains are blocked,
completely blocked, by some sort of a mesmerism.

08:05.929 --> 08:15.479
They just can’t think that there could be
something very wrong with these people.

08:15.479 --> 08:25.099
When living in Italy, I found or I was shocked
how this catholic church was working out and

08:25.099 --> 08:33.149
what the priests were doing and all kinds
of scandals much more than we have in our

08:33.149 --> 08:34.149
country!

08:34.149 --> 08:44.000
Money bungling and molesting women and having
children – I mean every sort of dirty habit

08:44.000 --> 08:45.329
they had.

08:45.329 --> 08:46.829
Supposed to be priests.

08:46.829 --> 08:54.069
They were called ‘fathers’, they were
called ‘mothers’, they were called ‘sisters’,

08:54.069 --> 08:56.490
they were called ‘brothers’.

08:56.490 --> 09:05.220
And to me it was really a shock – I didn’t
know that such things are happening in the

09:05.220 --> 09:10.310
name of Christ.

09:10.310 --> 09:17.060
What Christ tried to show through his birth:
there is no need to have very comfortable,

09:17.060 --> 09:25.829
great birth in a big hospital in London, no!

09:25.829 --> 09:36.740
The simplicity of his birth should have made
all the Christians extremely simple and not

09:36.740 --> 09:39.110
at all money oriented.

09:39.110 --> 09:45.709
For money they went all round, crushed so
many people all over the world, when you go

09:45.709 --> 09:57.709
to Brazil or to Chile or to Argentina, you
do not find a single man belonging to the

09:57.709 --> 10:04.470
aboriginal people and they’re so unkind
to them.

10:04.470 --> 10:11.240
Unbelievable how aggressive these people are.

10:11.240 --> 10:17.410
Even in England, where theres protestants
I find the same thing among them.

10:17.410 --> 10:23.740
You must go on saying “thank you, thank
you” morning till evening, otherwise you

10:23.740 --> 10:25.510
are finished.

10:25.510 --> 10:26.510
Racialism.

10:26.510 --> 10:31.700
What was the race of Christ?

10:31.700 --> 10:33.279
Was he a fair man?

10:33.279 --> 10:34.279
No!

10:34.279 --> 10:35.279
Was he a white person?

10:35.279 --> 10:37.670
Not at all!

10:37.670 --> 10:38.850
What was His colour?

10:38.850 --> 10:41.759
He was brown like Indians.

10:41.759 --> 10:48.889
From where does this racialism come to these
Westerners?

10:48.889 --> 10:51.550
I just don’t understand.

10:51.550 --> 11:00.529
It has nothing to do with Christ or if it
is real Christianity.

11:00.529 --> 11:09.170
You go anywhere, you’ll be surprised, how
the faithful, simple-hearted people are misused

11:09.170 --> 11:11.329
by these churches.

11:11.329 --> 11:22.860
They’re used for voting, they’re used
for money, for everything – to such an extent

11:22.860 --> 11:36.350
that money was made, artificially counterfeited
in billions, by the church itself.

11:36.350 --> 11:49.480
Such autocracy, such control, such authority
they had that whatever they did was, the pope

11:49.480 --> 11:54.950
is infallible, whatever he does is alright.

11:54.950 --> 12:04.779
No idea of sinning, no idea of hell, no idea
of Christ – which was nothing but purity

12:04.779 --> 12:08.920
and innocence.

12:08.920 --> 12:17.870
Christ had taken a hunter and hit all the
people who were selling in front of the temple,

12:17.870 --> 12:19.970
because God cannot be sold.

12:19.970 --> 12:23.930
They were not selling God, they were selling
only goods, but he said the respect of the

12:23.930 --> 12:30.720
temple, talked about the respect of the temple.

12:30.720 --> 12:37.560
Another great thing Christians have done,
is to blame Jews for killing Christ.

12:37.560 --> 12:38.560
Wonderful!

12:38.560 --> 12:48.639
Put all the blame on others, this is the speciality
of Christians even today, is to put the blame

12:48.639 --> 12:51.890
of what wrong you are doing on others, very
common.

12:51.890 --> 13:01.949
And this is what you see very clearly in those
countries, who call themselves Christians.

13:01.949 --> 13:03.379
They blamed Jews.

13:03.379 --> 13:10.190
First of all, those who were Jews at that
time might have been Indians later on.

13:10.190 --> 13:13.170
Alright, so they don’t believe in reincarnation.

13:13.170 --> 13:19.829
I mean to say the same Jews who were there
are born again.

13:19.829 --> 13:33.470
Thirdly that the Jews never killed Christ,
never, because in the multitude how can you

13:33.470 --> 13:34.470
decide?

13:34.470 --> 13:42.579
Is the judge who decided and ordered, he was
a Roman.

13:42.579 --> 13:50.180
So the Roman empire didn’t want to take
the responsibility of His death so they said

13:50.180 --> 13:53.070
Jews have killed Him.

13:53.070 --> 14:02.490
So Mr Hitler got after them and he really
tortured them, really it’s too much, one

14:02.490 --> 14:12.740
can’t even understand how can – he believed
in catholic religion, how could he kill small

14:12.740 --> 14:18.459
little children, in the gas chamber?

14:18.459 --> 14:29.069
But now the same people who were tortured
are also becoming very aggressive and now

14:29.069 --> 14:36.399
they are against the Palestinians and the
Palestinians on their own are Muslims and

14:36.399 --> 14:41.370
the Muslims are playing a havoc all over.

14:41.370 --> 14:55.270
So when you go through the history, and see
the life of Christ, what do you find is aggressiveness

14:55.270 --> 15:02.310
from one to another, from that to another,
passing from one to another.

15:02.310 --> 15:12.199
If somebody slaps somebody, the another person
will try to kill that person.

15:12.199 --> 15:19.589
So this religion has created this divisiveness;
people are just killing each other in the

15:19.589 --> 15:24.639
name of God, in the name of religion.

15:24.639 --> 15:30.010
Even in Sahaja Yoga, you’ll be surprised,
I have seen people taking advantage of my

15:30.010 --> 15:36.449
name, and trying to get into some mesmeric
groups.

15:36.449 --> 15:40.180
I can’t understand.

15:40.180 --> 15:46.199
Using my name, using my photograph!

15:46.199 --> 15:55.470
So beware this should not happen to you people.

15:55.470 --> 16:09.009
Using the name of Christ, the Incarnation
of Divine Love, they are doing all these works

16:09.009 --> 16:17.829
of violence, hatred, of cheating, I mean very
debased people.

16:17.829 --> 16:24.540
And from one to another it passes, to the
another it passes.

16:24.540 --> 16:28.369
Same thing happens in Sahaja Yoga.

16:28.369 --> 16:34.209
If I told somebody that you are no more a
leader, somebody else is the leader, immediately

16:34.209 --> 16:42.309
that person gets angry, he forgets what good
sahaj has done to him, he just forgets.

16:42.309 --> 16:47.790
If I tell him the leadership should pass to
somebody else, finished!

16:47.790 --> 16:54.759
Then he forgets that whatever good was done
to him, whatever Sahaja Yoga has done for

16:54.759 --> 16:59.980
him, he’s living only because Sahaj has
helped him.

16:59.980 --> 17:04.240
So this leadership goes into the heads of
people.

17:04.240 --> 17:12.600
Sahaja Yoga is not here to make leaders out
of you, no never.

17:12.600 --> 17:21.569
It is just for convenience we have leaders
and if they become inconvenient we have to

17:21.569 --> 17:26.620
change it, that’s all, as simple as that.

17:26.620 --> 17:38.760
But still I find this idea of authority is
something very great and they start using

17:38.760 --> 17:46.159
it left and right, everywhere it is happening
practically in every country, has happened

17:46.159 --> 17:55.700
and still happening
which is a very sad thing.

17:55.700 --> 18:01.230
This will never bring forth my efforts.

18:01.230 --> 18:09.460
My effort is to synthesise the whole, not
to divide, by no chance to divide.

18:09.460 --> 18:22.640
Only thing, whatever is wrong, whatever is
unholy has to be brought to your notice.

18:22.640 --> 18:30.649
See as a housewife, when we clean the rice,
there are some white stones in it, we take

18:30.649 --> 18:31.980
them out.

18:31.980 --> 18:35.649
We don’t cook rice with that stone, do we?

18:35.649 --> 18:38.149
And such stones have to go out.

18:38.149 --> 18:42.010
So some of them are just like stones.

18:42.010 --> 18:44.789
You cannot change them.

18:44.789 --> 18:53.260
Namadeva has said that they are like a fly,
who when lives gives us trouble by coming

18:53.260 --> 19:02.990
on our food and by making us feel nauseated
and if by mistake we take her inside in our

19:02.990 --> 19:08.649
stomach, she is dead but still she troubles
us.

19:08.649 --> 19:11.950
These are all rakshasas, I should say.

19:11.950 --> 19:18.179
They can never understand Sahaja Yoga and
they will always try to trouble us.

19:18.179 --> 19:25.950
But what must the people who have achieved
Sahaja Yoga should do.

19:25.950 --> 19:35.029
Should they also take to such methods?

19:35.029 --> 19:40.370
I have never blamed anyone for anything.

19:40.370 --> 19:45.270
Like, people say, “Mother he didn’t give
any money to Sahaja Yoga so he has lost all

19:45.270 --> 19:46.270
his money.”

19:46.270 --> 19:50.289
I never say like that “He should have donated
some money!”

19:50.289 --> 19:52.980
I never ask for donations, I never ask for
money.

19:52.980 --> 19:56.480
Every time I say it’s all sufficient.

19:56.480 --> 19:57.480
Don’t need.

19:57.480 --> 20:11.549
I have never asked for a single pie from anyone
to be given to me even when I needed

20:11.549 --> 20:22.000
because I know I don’t have that problem.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.149
From the life of Christ one has to understand.

20:25.149 --> 20:27.890
He had no problems.

20:27.890 --> 20:30.710
He was fearless.

20:30.710 --> 20:33.470
He knew he was the son of God.

20:33.470 --> 20:35.559
He had no problems at all.

20:35.559 --> 20:41.330
He faced everything, even his crucifixion.

20:41.330 --> 20:46.470
And people, I think, liked his crucifixion
or what?

20:46.470 --> 20:49.720
They carry the cross.

20:49.720 --> 21:04.720
Of course is the transformed symbol of Swastika
no doubt but still.

21:04.720 --> 21:11.940
He had to sacrifice his life.

21:11.940 --> 21:24.210
He sacrificed his life for all the human being
not for only white or black, brown or blue

21:24.210 --> 21:35.230
but he sacrificed his life for all of us so
that we could cross over our agnya.

21:35.230 --> 21:42.720
The condemnation we should do is not of others
but of ourselves.

21:42.720 --> 21:52.840
We can call that as a crucifixion of ours
by which we see as Sahaja Yogis where are

21:52.840 --> 21:53.840
we going.

21:53.840 --> 22:00.160
I’m told there are some 80-90 Sahaja Yogis
who have come, who were mesmerised by some

22:00.160 --> 22:01.160
people.

22:01.160 --> 22:06.520
How could Sahaja Yogis be mesmerised?

22:06.520 --> 22:12.610
Is it possible?

22:12.610 --> 22:22.659
They never must be praying, they may not be
doing meditation.

22:22.659 --> 22:26.090
How can they get into it?

22:26.090 --> 22:30.919
And now they are asking for forgiveness.

22:30.919 --> 22:35.340
I forgive but that doesn’t mean they will
be alright.

22:35.340 --> 22:40.270
We cannot fix them anymore.

22:40.270 --> 22:46.000
We do not put spoiled apples with the good
ones, do we?

22:46.000 --> 22:48.390
This [is] no wisdom.

22:48.390 --> 22:53.690
They are already spoiled, and they should
keep out till I say.

22:53.690 --> 22:59.529
They should not attend any centre, they should
not come to any puja.

22:59.529 --> 23:01.480
They should let them cleanse themselves.

23:01.480 --> 23:08.419
Though a rotten apple cannot get well they
can.

23:08.419 --> 23:14.360
They should try to understand that they were
not Sahaja Yogis.

23:14.360 --> 23:24.029
If a Sahaja Yogi can get mesmerised, then
what’s the use of doing Sahaja Yoga.

23:24.029 --> 23:32.340
What’s the use of getting your Kundalini
raised?

23:32.340 --> 23:40.210
That means that they are very poor Sahaja
Yogis.

23:40.210 --> 23:49.750
Surprisingly I have not seen this kind of
a phenomena in the west, very surprising!

23:49.750 --> 23:56.679
Western Sahaja Yogis, whatever they were,
they are great Sahaja Yogis, I must say if

23:56.679 --> 24:03.220
you consider the number of good people there.

24:03.220 --> 24:07.730
They have given up so-called Christianity,
they have given up all this nonsense, drinking,

24:07.730 --> 24:14.019
drugs, womanising, everything they have given
up.

24:14.019 --> 24:22.769
And I haven’t met one person who has taken
to drinking again or who has taken even to

24:22.769 --> 24:24.860
smoking.

24:24.860 --> 24:30.960
This Yoga bhoomi of yours, which is India.

24:30.960 --> 24:34.149
How could it happen here?

24:34.149 --> 24:36.990
Specially in Maharashtra.

24:36.990 --> 24:44.299
I think some devilish people are born in this
Maharashtra all the time because how is it

24:44.299 --> 24:53.070
they tortured each and every saint?

24:53.070 --> 25:00.220
How?

25:00.220 --> 25:09.490
How is it, they have been so much enticed
by somebody who is saying something which

25:09.490 --> 25:16.750
I have never said?

25:16.750 --> 25:27.320
Shows a very low type of people, very low.

25:27.320 --> 25:36.130
And they must have been always being born
in this Maharashtra, I am sure and again they

25:36.130 --> 25:44.160
are born today.

25:44.160 --> 25:52.750
I never wanted to talk about this at the jubilant
time like this when Christ was born.

25:52.750 --> 25:59.840
Yes, it’s a thing of jubilation because
He came as a Saviour.

25:59.840 --> 26:04.120
He did everything that is possible under the
sun.

26:04.120 --> 26:16.620
For us it’s alright but what about Him,
what did we give Him?

26:16.620 --> 26:22.320
In the same way many Sahaja Yogis go on demanding,
Mother we can’t even meet you, we can’t

26:22.320 --> 26:28.039
even shake hands with you, we can’t even
fall at your feet.

26:28.039 --> 26:32.090
We can’t do this, we can’t do that.

26:32.090 --> 26:33.559
It surprises me.

26:33.559 --> 26:38.460
“You must do this, You must do that.”

26:38.460 --> 26:44.390
All the time lecturing to me.

26:44.390 --> 26:47.899
What you must do?

26:47.899 --> 26:58.530
You must do, is to meditate and to believe
that this Paramchaitanya is My power and that

26:58.530 --> 27:02.059
you have felt My power within you.

27:02.059 --> 27:06.350
The more you are away from you the better
you will be.

27:06.350 --> 27:18.679
Absolutely, I can’t understand the demanding
nature of some Sahaja Yogis.

27:18.679 --> 27:28.710
They have got their Jagruti (awakening of
Kundalini) which would never have happened.

27:28.710 --> 27:34.490
If Christ wanted, He would have killed all
of them and lived very well, but I think He

27:34.490 --> 27:51.220
must have been fed up with the stupidity all
around.

27:51.220 --> 28:00.500
So at this time, we have to understand that
such a great Incarnation came on this earth.

28:00.500 --> 28:03.180
Of course he couldn’t give Realisation.

28:03.180 --> 28:08.259
Imagine the people who were about to crucify
Him, how could he give realisation?

28:08.259 --> 28:15.840
Supposing somebody comes with the dagger at
Me, can I give them realisation?

28:15.840 --> 28:19.409
It’s all right.

28:19.409 --> 28:23.100
Nobody listened to Them, nobody thought anything
of them but not you!

28:23.100 --> 28:26.010
You people have got your realisation.

28:26.010 --> 28:27.570
You are born again people.

28:27.570 --> 28:29.429
You are great people.

28:29.429 --> 28:31.000
Your potential is there.

28:31.000 --> 28:36.739
Instead of utilising that now, what are you
doing?

28:36.739 --> 28:41.919
How many people are really involved in Sahaja
Yoga?

28:41.919 --> 28:42.919
Introspect.

28:42.919 --> 28:47.100
They have their own business, they have their
own this thing, they have – How many are

28:47.100 --> 28:49.770
really involved in Sahaja Yoga?

28:49.770 --> 29:01.169
He had only twelve disciples, except for one
or two, all of them dedicated without realisation,

29:01.169 --> 29:08.509
dedicated fully to the work of Christianity
and which spread because they had not much

29:08.509 --> 29:11.220
idea about the whole thing.

29:11.220 --> 29:19.630
The Christians that they had were just converts,
useless people

29:19.630 --> 29:26.390
and I would say that if they did not do any
justice to the birth of Christ, one can understand.

29:26.390 --> 29:30.940
But what about you people?

29:30.940 --> 29:44.750
Who are born twice, who have got their self
Knowledge, who are so equipped with all the

29:44.750 --> 29:56.159
powers, who are connected with this all power,
what you can call the power of Divine Love?

29:56.159 --> 30:07.690
All your powers can be utilised, can be known.

30:07.690 --> 30:13.740
It’s like some dynamic machine which has
started.

30:13.740 --> 30:26.549
Few wheels are moving but there are so many
wheels after wheels and so much you can do.

30:26.549 --> 30:33.610
I cannot blame the Christians who are so stupid
because after all they never got their awakening.

30:33.610 --> 30:41.409
Only some priest would bring some water, put
it on their head and baptised them, finished.

30:41.409 --> 30:45.909
But what about you people?

30:45.909 --> 30:51.440
I have lived because of you, because I wanted
to see that you people mature.

30:51.440 --> 30:57.420
That’s the idea of the Mother is.

30:57.420 --> 31:05.580
There are many who are matured, I would not
say, but still many have to be matured.

31:05.580 --> 31:11.429
Doesn’t mean that you should be able to
give big lectures, or write books or anything.

31:11.429 --> 31:14.389
But within yourself you should mature.

31:14.389 --> 31:32.929
Your own personality should flower into the
fragrance of love of divinity.

31:32.929 --> 31:36.990
This is what I would say is the difference
between Me and Christ.

31:36.990 --> 31:41.570
He said “Baba I had enough, No, No, No more!

31:41.570 --> 31:45.820
With these stupid people.”

31:45.820 --> 31:49.799
Not Me, I knew what was the world like.

31:49.799 --> 31:52.460
I knew what had happened to this world.

31:52.460 --> 31:59.070
Today the world is much worse, because all
the religions are fighting among themselves,

31:59.070 --> 32:00.450
firstly.

32:00.450 --> 32:08.330
All the politicians are trying to be very
badly corrupt, competing in that corruption.

32:08.330 --> 32:14.300
Nobody has sense of truth and honesty.

32:14.300 --> 32:25.720
Everybody is involved in the advertisement,
newspapers, media, this, that, which is the

32:25.720 --> 32:28.460
most corrupting influence today.

32:28.460 --> 32:39.990
With all this background, I know by the year
2000, Sahaja Yoga will come out in the whole

32:39.990 --> 32:52.749
world as something very great…(applause)
– You did not allow me to complete the sentence

32:52.749 --> 32:58.620
– if you people become real Sahaja Yogis.

32:58.620 --> 32:59.700
All of you.

32:59.700 --> 33:05.799
All of you who are attending to Me here.

33:05.799 --> 33:09.510
Even this much group if it becomes real Sahaja
Yogis.

33:09.510 --> 33:13.789
It doesn’t matter if I cannot meet you personally.

33:13.789 --> 33:17.120
It doesn’t matter if I cannot go to your
places.

33:17.120 --> 33:20.019
It doesn’t matter, nothing matters.

33:20.019 --> 33:26.600
Christ’s disciples worked when he never
existed.

33:26.600 --> 33:35.210
So it’s not important, what is important
is that you are the people who are responsible

33:35.210 --> 33:41.070
for the emancipation of this world, for the
synthesis of this world, to bring peace and

33:41.070 --> 33:43.830
joy and happiness to people.

33:43.830 --> 33:50.299
Just now when I was coming, people spread
the shawls.

33:50.299 --> 33:59.720
It reminded Me of Christ when he came, they
brought palms leaves to wish him and spread

33:59.720 --> 34:03.990
their shawls on the ground for him to go,
and where does he go?

34:03.990 --> 34:04.990
To Gallows.

34:04.990 --> 34:13.270
He goes to cross, he goes for his death.

34:13.270 --> 34:21.690
When you show your love for Me, you have to
know that you have to love the whole work

34:21.690 --> 34:22.970
of Sahaja Yoga.

34:22.970 --> 34:30.490
It’s not some personal relationship with
Me that is going to work out.

34:30.490 --> 34:35.030
All these western countries in the influence
of Christianity will go down, you will see.

34:35.030 --> 34:38.330
They are going down already because there’s
is no morality.

34:38.330 --> 34:45.320
There’s recession, all kinds of problems,
their children are wavered, they are drinking,

34:45.320 --> 34:47.520
smoking, doing all kinds of things.

34:47.520 --> 34:50.820
Even their influence on us is corrupting us.

34:50.820 --> 34:54.060
Antichrist activity, throughout if you find.

34:54.060 --> 34:56.700
It’s nothing but antichrist activity.

34:56.700 --> 35:00.850
Who is the Antichrist?

35:00.850 --> 35:05.630
They are describing he is the antichrist,
that fellow is the Antichrist.

35:05.630 --> 35:07.000
That’s not the thing.

35:07.000 --> 35:16.870
There is an antichrist within us, who accepts
all these things which are against the purity

35:16.870 --> 35:22.240
and love of Christ.

35:22.240 --> 35:26.780
So first of all among yourselves.

35:26.780 --> 35:30.300
What is he going?

35:30.300 --> 35:33.070
Sit down!

35:33.070 --> 35:39.430
You must teach your children some manners.

35:39.430 --> 35:44.600
This girl who was drowned is because you neglected
the child.

35:44.600 --> 35:45.790
The father, where was he?

35:45.790 --> 35:46.790
I don’t know.

35:46.790 --> 35:52.930
I can’t understand how can a child be left
like that.

35:52.930 --> 36:02.920
It’s important to discipline your children.

36:02.920 --> 36:08.150
…if you have a neighbour, you’ve had it.

36:08.150 --> 36:15.131
He will try to find out where you go, what
you do.

36:15.131 --> 36:24.610
He will have a binocular to see and you make
any noise, you are finished but even if you

36:24.610 --> 36:28.490
sing, you are finished.

36:28.490 --> 36:30.060
In that way, Indians are better.

36:30.060 --> 36:33.950
They don’t have that noise difficulty.

36:33.950 --> 36:35.390
We don’t have.

36:35.390 --> 36:36.730
Indians can live in the noise.

36:36.730 --> 36:42.230
I wanted to find out why Indians are so adjustable
to noise.

36:42.230 --> 36:45.120
They don’t mind noise.

36:45.120 --> 36:53.870
I found out the reason is that in the west
people are under stress and strain and that’s

36:53.870 --> 36:55.540
why they can’t bear.

36:55.540 --> 37:00.420
But in India, people don’t know what is
stress and strain is.

37:00.420 --> 37:05.952
Still that has not developed, I don’t know
how to that extent.

37:05.952 --> 37:08.040
That disease has not come.

37:08.040 --> 37:14.160
That might be the reason that they are so
much frightened of noises.

37:14.160 --> 37:16.590
People will come from villages here.

37:16.590 --> 37:21.190
They’ll sleep on the station, nothing happens.

37:21.190 --> 37:27.040
The trains are coming and going, nicely sleeping.

37:27.040 --> 37:34.370
Imagine in the west, thank God, in Italy we
have neighbours little far away, we had a

37:34.370 --> 37:35.370
little trouble.

37:35.370 --> 37:40.510
But in England, we had to go on changing our
ashram from one place to another, run away

37:40.510 --> 37:45.460
from here to there, because of great neighbours,
we had one of them had the name Mr Peace.

37:45.460 --> 37:51.110
I don’t know who gave him that name.

37:51.110 --> 37:54.340
Such contradictions in life.

37:54.340 --> 37:56.890
Such horrible contradictions.

37:56.890 --> 38:07.370
I don’t know how will they learn how to
love their neighbour.

38:07.370 --> 38:10.020
But Indians do.

38:10.020 --> 38:15.580
Somehow they don’t have this problem, not
much.

38:15.580 --> 38:17.400
Sometimes they have but not so much.

38:17.400 --> 38:27.350
But if there is a music supposing, all the
neighbours will join, bring tea, bring this,

38:27.350 --> 38:31.600
they’ll be enjoying the music.

38:31.600 --> 38:37.560
But there the collectivity is so little I
think, I can’t understand how can they call

38:37.560 --> 38:38.940
themselves Christians.

38:38.940 --> 38:50.140
Only they go to church, well dressed and our
Mayor told Me that for fifteen minutes hardly

38:50.140 --> 38:51.890
we can sit.

38:51.890 --> 38:55.050
We start looking at the watches.

38:55.050 --> 38:56.400
Fifteen minutes.

38:56.400 --> 39:05.120
And after half an hour, we all run out of
the jail and how is it these people are sitting

39:05.120 --> 39:07.020
with you for hours together.

39:07.020 --> 39:14.350
I said, I must be mesmerising them.

39:14.350 --> 39:20.160
I mean they are not so collective, unless
and until they drink, they cannot be collective.

39:20.160 --> 39:24.770
Unless and until they get intoxicated, they
cannot talk to each other.

39:24.770 --> 39:28.990
They are all the time tired.

39:28.990 --> 39:30.700
They are supposed to be Christians.

39:30.700 --> 39:39.700
They are so tired, you see them in the films
or anywhere, they come and sit down “hah!”.

39:39.700 --> 39:41.700
What has happened?

39:41.700 --> 39:43.690
Young people.

39:43.690 --> 39:48.500
All the time thinking, thinking, thinking,
which comes from Agya.

39:48.500 --> 39:58.030
Which comes from anti-Christ activity!

39:58.030 --> 40:00.120
Anti-Christ activity, thinking, thinking,
thinking.

40:00.120 --> 40:02.660
What should we do tomorrow?

40:02.660 --> 40:06.780
What is to be done and all that.

40:06.780 --> 40:20.660
Still we have to hope that this kind of religion
will finish.

40:20.660 --> 40:23.560
All such religions must finish.

40:23.560 --> 40:25.830
They have to go now, it’s too much.

40:25.830 --> 40:31.530
you cannot support them.

40:31.530 --> 40:39.410
They are so much full of anti-religious temperament
that you just can’t bear them.

40:39.410 --> 40:51.240
Better to finish Islam, Hinduism, Christianity,
Sikhism, Buddhism, Jainism, all isms one after

40:51.240 --> 40:55.040
another.

40:55.040 --> 40:58.220
To what religion did Christ belong?

40:58.220 --> 41:03.520
I don’t know.

41:03.520 --> 41:07.940
You belong to one religion which is Sahaj.

41:07.940 --> 41:12.600
Which is the universal religion, which is
the pure religion, which is born within you.

41:12.600 --> 41:21.740
You don’t belong to any other religion because
there is no religion in that.

41:21.740 --> 41:39.550
So by the time 2000 years, I hope all these
religions will run away from this earth.

41:39.550 --> 41:44.340
(applause).

41:44.340 --> 41:55.230
All of them fighting for nothing at all, killing
each other for nothing at all.

41:55.230 --> 41:59.820
They want, they want to fight, they like to
fight.

41:59.820 --> 42:06.780
Why blame Koran, why blame Bible, why blame
Christ, why blame anyone.

42:06.780 --> 42:08.090
They want to fight.

42:08.090 --> 42:11.490
They are of divisive nature.

42:11.490 --> 42:17.640
They want to have separate nations, separate
communities, separate this.

42:17.640 --> 42:23.410
Once you start separating you are antichrist.

42:23.410 --> 42:24.730
Absolutely.

42:24.730 --> 42:38.700
In Sahaja Yoga also I say that you are one
identity, you are not separate country, separate

42:38.700 --> 42:46.590
organisation, separate this, doesn’t exist
in my own idea.

42:46.590 --> 42:48.310
Doesn’t exist.

42:48.310 --> 42:53.440
I never thought of it.

42:53.440 --> 42:59.890
We are all children of one Father and of one
Mother.

42:59.890 --> 43:04.200
We have no business to think we are separate.

43:04.200 --> 43:08.110
Even now, I have seen groups are made very
easily.

43:08.110 --> 43:09.110
How?

43:09.110 --> 43:15.940
The groups are made.

43:15.940 --> 43:30.780
Like I find Maharashtrians

43:30.780 --> 43:39.390
are sitting together (Mother talks briefly
in Marathi.)

43:39.390 --> 43:47.090
Then we have group of the North Indians.

43:47.090 --> 43:53.680
Indians are quite separatist I tell you, somehow,
by temperament.

43:53.680 --> 44:00.060
North Indians also have separate separate
ideas.

44:00.060 --> 44:03.200
“You must come to Indore.”

44:03.200 --> 44:06.040
Why?

44:06.040 --> 44:07.920
Is it not a part of India?

44:07.920 --> 44:11.360
They can’t come to Delhi?

44:11.360 --> 44:16.360
“You must come to Kanpur, You must come
to Allahabad, you must come to Indore.”

44:16.360 --> 44:21.220
You must go to every village, every place.

44:21.220 --> 44:22.270
Why?

44:22.270 --> 44:35.750
You are born today in Delhi, tomorrow you
will be born in some horrid place, then, “This

44:35.750 --> 44:39.040
place is mine.

44:39.040 --> 44:41.300
This is my house..must come to my house.”

44:41.300 --> 44:42.660
That’s another headache.

44:42.660 --> 44:44.180
“You must come to my house.”

44:44.180 --> 44:48.840
Mine, mine, mine, mine.

44:48.840 --> 45:02.670
Once you start that, you are finished, you
are no more belonging to Christ, no more.

45:02.670 --> 45:09.011
This is a very, very common programme – even
today that, if you see around yourself, must

45:09.011 --> 45:13.340
be people from your own country.

45:13.340 --> 45:20.820
Just see around yourself, are you sitting
with another people?

45:20.820 --> 45:22.360
Who is the other?

45:22.360 --> 45:26.930
In Sahaja Yoga, who is the other?

45:26.930 --> 45:40.930
We are all one and this unity we have to learn,
if you really love Me and Christ.

45:40.930 --> 45:48.060
All this groupism and all this has to end
now among Sahaja Yogis, must end.

45:48.060 --> 45:57.080
We are all one identity, we are all one living
body.

45:57.080 --> 46:00.250
We are all one living organism.

46:00.250 --> 46:04.420
We cannot say we are separate.

46:04.420 --> 46:13.870
Can this hand separate from the body, can
it exist?

46:13.870 --> 46:21.310
Once you start giving it up, you will be surprised,
you will have real enjoyment.

46:21.310 --> 46:32.480
But once you have all these ideas about my,
my, you can’t even enjoy Sahaja Yoga.

46:32.480 --> 46:44.600
Cannot enjoy anybody else – “my wife,
my children, my house”, my this, my that.

46:44.600 --> 46:48.790
That awakening has to come within.

46:48.790 --> 46:52.830
“I don’t belong to this country.”

46:52.830 --> 46:59.030
Many girls you see and boys have written,
“We’ll have Indian marriage.”

46:59.030 --> 47:04.120
Only the age of the woman is 35 years.

47:04.120 --> 47:05.120
Only!

47:05.120 --> 47:13.880
Now where will I find a husband for her in
India, must be some widower or somebody.

47:13.880 --> 47:15.700
Must have an Indian marriage!

47:15.700 --> 47:20.210
Can you beat that?

47:20.210 --> 47:23.090
Such people, is impossible to marry them.

47:23.090 --> 47:28.550
I give you choice, all right have a choice.

47:28.550 --> 47:36.460
I also have a choice – I can’t marry you!

47:36.460 --> 47:39.060
That is My choice!

47:39.060 --> 47:43.720
You have the freedom to say where you want
to marry – alright marry.

47:43.720 --> 47:49.430
But as far as I am concerned, I can’t marry
you like that.

47:49.430 --> 47:58.440
You have to marry wherever there is a good
match for you.

47:58.440 --> 48:04.800
Many Indian girls have married with Indians
boys, and have suffered a lot, such a lot,

48:04.800 --> 48:13.410
you won’t believe! (talks in Hindi briefly).

48:13.410 --> 48:16.220
Not in Sahaja Yoga any more!

48:16.220 --> 48:24.030
We have not been able to organise even one
marriage of a Hindustani with an Hindustani

48:24.030 --> 48:26.810
– not possible.

48:26.810 --> 48:31.470
That’s not the desire of the Divine.

48:31.470 --> 48:42.630
Why don’t you find in your own community
somewhere [the] same thing.

48:42.630 --> 48:45.030
As in India, is very particular.

48:45.030 --> 48:48.720
Very very particular.

48:48.720 --> 48:51.940
Like when my daughter was to be married, they
said “No!

48:51.940 --> 48:54.320
He his not a Shrivastava.

48:54.320 --> 48:59.410
If he is a Shrivastava also, he is not the
same Shrivastava.

48:59.410 --> 49:02.720
Even if he is the same Shrivastava, his this
thing is different!”

49:02.720 --> 49:03.720
I mean.

49:03.720 --> 49:05.320
I said, “Now this is going to finish”.

49:05.320 --> 49:11.580
Because I had all my elders living and they
were after me.

49:11.580 --> 49:17.550
I said “Whether he is a Shrivastava or not
Shrivastava I am going to marry them, finished!”

49:17.550 --> 49:20.270
My husband agreed.

49:20.270 --> 49:25.330
Same with my grandchildren.

49:25.330 --> 49:28.390
If you get Shrivastava, well and good, otherwise
forget it.

49:28.390 --> 49:30.980
Maharashtrians also same.

49:30.980 --> 49:40.050
Maharashtrians who have become Christians
[are] also the same, you be amazed, Christians!

49:40.050 --> 49:47.500
Now they are saying we are Dalit Christians,
means who were converted from the lower caste

49:47.500 --> 49:48.740
into Christianity.

49:48.740 --> 49:49.740
Now there is a new caste that’s come.

49:49.740 --> 49:54.960
Once you have become Christian, what is your
caste?

49:54.960 --> 49:58.540
You are Christian, not that.

49:58.540 --> 50:00.770
They are Dalits and they are higher Christians.

50:00.770 --> 50:08.800
They will not marry in the Dalit and Dalit
won’t marry in the higher.

50:08.800 --> 50:18.930
Supposed to be Christians, following Christ,
going to church regularly, well dressed.

50:18.930 --> 50:21.250
Even if they do not have a proper suit.

50:21.250 --> 50:26.750
They must wear like English some suit, borrow
it, and go to church because according to

50:26.750 --> 50:31.160
Indian Christians, Christ was born in England.

50:31.160 --> 50:36.820
(laughter) Really, you won’t believe.

50:36.820 --> 50:41.000
Unless and until you wear a suit and a tie,
you can’t go to the Church.

50:41.000 --> 50:53.210
Can you imagine, anybody, going with a dhoti
to church? (more laughter) Impossible situation.

50:53.210 --> 51:01.560
Even in my time, thank God I didn’t marry
a Christian, but my own sisters and all were

51:01.560 --> 51:06.270
forced to wear veils and not the saris, wear
the frocks and the veils.

51:06.270 --> 51:11.110
Can you imagine the wedding dress.

51:11.110 --> 51:14.690
We, Indian women, can’t do without the saris.

51:14.690 --> 51:16.850
But they were forced.

51:16.850 --> 51:20.620
So many women married the way English marry.

51:20.620 --> 51:27.960
And I was amazed even the Japanese who are
Christians come to Australia and dress up

51:27.960 --> 51:38.500
like these English brides and get married
– because they are Christians.

51:38.500 --> 51:44.090
That shows that they believe that Christ was
born in England or what?

51:44.090 --> 51:54.480
Actually, for Christians it’s not necessary
to worry about any dress.

51:54.480 --> 52:00.950
All this nonsense comes from the West that
you must dress up like this, you must have

52:00.950 --> 52:03.290
your spoon here, fork here.

52:03.290 --> 52:11.610
Did Christ eat with fork and spoon?

52:11.610 --> 52:15.490
He was born in the manger.

52:15.490 --> 52:21.230
It’s impossible to understand these people
are Christians.

52:21.230 --> 52:25.850
So much worried about the spoons and forks
and they came to your house for dinner, they

52:25.850 --> 52:31.040
lift the plate to see from what company you
have bought it.

52:31.040 --> 52:32.950
[That’s] very important!

52:32.950 --> 52:34.870
Such silly people!

52:34.870 --> 52:39.640
I tell you they call themselves Christians.

52:39.640 --> 52:47.750
Christ was born in the manger and [they are]
so particular about nonsensical things.

52:47.750 --> 52:58.110
You see one must understand the greatness
of His birth, in which he has shown that he

52:58.110 --> 53:03.190
was born with the cows tied there and the
calves were there.

53:03.190 --> 53:11.680
He was born in the manger.

53:11.680 --> 53:18.310
Not only the Christians abroad but they are
also in India the same – you can make out

53:18.310 --> 53:19.850
a Christian in no time.

53:19.850 --> 53:27.950
See them on a Sunday morning.

53:27.950 --> 53:37.130
That way my father opposed it – he used
to wear kurta, because Christ wore kurta.

53:37.130 --> 53:43.210
He didn’t wear suit, did he?

53:43.210 --> 53:45.230
And so superficial they are.

53:45.230 --> 53:47.820
Nothing to learn from them.

53:47.820 --> 53:56.840
They will put here on top [a label written]
“Saville Row”, On top of the suit!!

53:56.840 --> 54:05.310
Such stupid people, I tell you, and the Indians
are following them left and right, I can’t

54:05.310 --> 54:06.530
understand.

54:06.530 --> 54:07.570
They are anti-Christ.

54:07.570 --> 54:12.410
Don’t follow them on these points.

54:12.410 --> 54:19.550
Indians have at least certain sense of dignity.

54:19.550 --> 54:29.490
If you have any, why should you wear a suit
on a May day here?

54:29.490 --> 54:30.960
In this heat?

54:30.960 --> 54:33.780
We are Sahaja Yogis.

54:33.780 --> 54:38.440
We have to wear a common dress of a common
man.

54:38.440 --> 54:46.130
Whom are we going to impress except for this
Paramchaitanya?

54:46.130 --> 54:58.740
They are extremely superficial extremely meticulously
particular about their dress, how they live

54:58.740 --> 55:02.340
and it’s really horrible.

55:02.340 --> 55:10.470
I have seen this and that is the reason I
think I should warn you.

55:10.470 --> 55:17.340
Don’t take to that culture, that is anti-Christ
culture.

55:17.340 --> 55:25.810
Absolutely anti-Christ in every way.

55:25.810 --> 55:33.480
In every way they have insulted Christ out
and out.

55:33.480 --> 55:38.510
You people should not anymore insult Christ.

55:38.510 --> 55:40.500
In a simple way you live.

55:40.500 --> 55:49.000
I mean now this sari, they forced me to wear
is like a big bag for Me but what to do.

55:49.000 --> 55:51.730
Yesterday also they forced Me, today also
they forced me.

55:51.730 --> 55:56.350
I am supposed to wear all this because I am
Adi Shakti, supposed to be.

55:56.350 --> 56:06.430
If I was Christ, I would have been better
off.

56:06.430 --> 56:09.330
He was much more free than Me!

56:09.330 --> 56:17.830
Now, with all this what we have to know, what
is the message?

56:17.830 --> 56:25.180
What is the message of Christ?

56:25.180 --> 56:33.600
That you develop your spirituality, your divinity
by which you know what is the dignity of a

56:33.600 --> 56:34.960
Sahaja Yogi is.

56:34.960 --> 56:41.860
He was your eldest brother I should say.

56:41.860 --> 56:45.670
His lifestyle you should follow.

56:45.670 --> 56:51.620
Absolutely not afraid of anything, not worried
about any job, nothing, not worried about

56:51.620 --> 57:00.310
any business anything, absolutely free from
all worries.

57:00.310 --> 57:08.450
So many examples we have, beautiful examples
of his life, but when we see Christians, we

57:08.450 --> 57:21.290
try to reflect it as an expression of the
life of Christ and that is where we make mistake.

57:21.290 --> 57:33.180
They are, by no means they are for Christ,
they are, by no means, following Christ.

57:33.180 --> 57:38.690
So as Sahaja Yogis, we have a different culture.

57:38.690 --> 57:41.580
We have a culture where we respect morality.

57:41.580 --> 57:45.980
We have dignity, we have our own personality.

57:45.980 --> 57:55.480
We are fearless, we don’t tell lies, we
don’t cheat and we can never get mesmerised.

57:55.480 --> 58:09.230
So we have to have, now we can call it “the
Mother’s culture”, and which is not in

58:09.230 --> 58:16.270
any way showing off, or in any way taking
to artificial things.

58:16.270 --> 58:23.541
The whole thing will change, the whole concept
will change, whole idea will change, once

58:23.541 --> 58:34.920
you understand that you are now in “the
Mother’s culture”.

58:34.920 --> 58:36.990
Now they have forced me, so I am wearing all
right.

58:36.990 --> 58:40.750
You want me to wear, alright I’ll wear.

58:40.750 --> 58:48.830
But normally if you leave it to Me what do
I wear, you know that.

58:48.830 --> 58:52.650
Secret is out already!

58:52.650 --> 58:57.920
If you want to give me presents, give me,
I never asked you for presents, nothing!

58:57.920 --> 58:59.780
Forcing the presents on my head!

58:59.780 --> 59:02.910
Alright, for your joy’s sake you have it.

59:02.910 --> 59:04.580
What to do?

59:04.580 --> 59:08.280
But one thing I must request these Maharashtrians.

59:08.280 --> 59:17.180
They are not going to give me anymore, anymore,
again anymore what they call is the oti part.

59:17.180 --> 59:21.090
My oti is overfull.

59:21.090 --> 59:25.920
Absolutely, nobody has to give me oti.

59:25.920 --> 59:31.840
If somebody gets married, if somebody has
a child, somebody has anything, they’ll

59:31.840 --> 59:33.950
bring the oti.

59:33.950 --> 59:39.380
There is no need to give me any oti, you can
go to the temple, you give your oti there

59:39.380 --> 59:47.210
it is resold and resold and resold in between
the sellers who are Gujaratis, the brahmins

59:47.210 --> 59:53.170
who are the pujaris make money.

59:53.170 --> 01:00:00.570
So no more oti, nobody is going to give Me
any oti whatsoever.

01:00:00.570 --> 01:00:12.730
On a Christmas day I have to say one thing
– what did we give to Christ.

01:00:12.730 --> 01:00:19.320
And the second question what are we going
to give to Mother.

01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:21.560
This is very important.

01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:29.520
I don’t want anything from you, nothing.

01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:33.280
I am fully content with Myself.

01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:41.000
What I want is that you must dedicate yourself
to Sahaja Yoga, to truth and to love.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:56.830
I will be very happy and also not to talk
like, what you call, Christ has called them,

01:00:56.830 --> 01:01:01.550
“murmuring souls” – talking here there,
one saying there.

01:01:01.550 --> 01:01:04.800
All this.I don’t like at all.

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:06.400
I don’t like it and it should not be done.

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:10.480
If you do like this, you will fall, fall very
badly.

01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:12.320
This is the last judgement.

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:17.260
Either you‘ll go to heaven or you‘ll go
to hell.

01:01:17.260 --> 01:01:20.090
It’s already working out like that.

01:01:20.090 --> 01:01:22.870
So let’s see.

01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:25.650
Where are you?

01:01:25.650 --> 01:01:31.500
So I have to again and again tell you as your
mother, I have to correct you and tell you

01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:43.210
that remember this is the last judgement and
please, do not take anymore to the activities

01:01:43.210 --> 01:01:46.970
which are anti-Christ.

01:01:46.970 --> 01:01:53.640
You can judge within yourself – [whether]
whatever you are doing is not good, and for

01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:57.170
that, best thing is to dedicate yourself to
Sahaja Yoga.

01:01:57.170 --> 01:02:01.230
But not to make money out of Sahaja Yoga.

01:02:01.230 --> 01:02:04.570
Not to make politics out of Sahaja Yoga.

01:02:04.570 --> 01:02:13.680
But make Sahaja Yoga like a big, huge, big
tree and it will work out.

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:16.390
I know it will work out.

01:02:16.390 --> 01:02:17.650
You have the potential.

01:02:17.650 --> 01:02:19.240
That’s why you are here.

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:25.050
May God bless you all
