00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:27.100
Today, we are celebrating the birth of Jesus
Christ.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:50.240
The birth of Jesus Christ is very symbolic,
because

00:01:50.240 --> 00:02:01.060
he was born
in such a manner that even the poorest of

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:07.490
poor won’t be born in the stable.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:32.590
And he was put in the
bed which was made of dried grass.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:49.620
He came on this earth to show people that
for a person who is an incarnation or who

00:02:49.620 --> 00:03:09.349
is a highly evolved soul, is not bothered
about the comfort of the body.

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:32.460
His message was so great and so deep, but
he had disciples who were not prepared for

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:37.159
the battle they had to fight.

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:42.230
Is the same thing that sometimes happens with
Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:59.959
He had only 12 disciples, we too have 12 types
of Sahaja Yogis, and all of them, though [they]

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:09.790
try to dedicate themselves to Christ, fell
a trap, some of them, to the worldly aspirations

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:22.569
or to their own hankerings.

00:04:22.569 --> 00:04:32.110
His message of love and forgiveness is the
same even today.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:40.689
Preached by all, all the saints, all the incarnations,
all the prophets.

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:49.580
They all have said about love and forgiveness.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:05:19.530
If it was challenged or people felt that this
won’t work out, they were asked to have

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:27.210
faith in what he said.

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:37.729
But they were simple people in those days
so they obeyed him.

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:47.749
Some of them definitely were very good, some
of them half-baked and few of them were people

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:54.960
who were doubting.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:08.960
He came on this earth to prepare for us our
Agya chakra and despite all his efforts one

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:18.060
finds very difficult and the people who follow
Christianity have the worst type of Agya.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:22.649
Worst type!

00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:28.539
Extremely aggressive, extremely planning type,
futuristic.

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:42.479
I mean all the troubles of the right side
are found in those countries who claim to

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:47.680
be Christians.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:53.569
Even the early Christians who were Gnostics,
‘gne’, ‘gne’ in Sanskrit means ‘know’,

00:06:53.569 --> 00:07:02.389
though [they] had the knowledge, the beginners
were also suppressed and tortured by the people

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:09.330
who were supposed to be in charge of Christian
religion.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:16.679
And so many Christians were massacred by the
so-called Christian priests and Christian

00:07:16.679 --> 00:07:24.199
churches, and still it is going on.

00:07:24.199 --> 00:07:37.860
What you find in the west is a great influence
of these churches on the minds of the people.

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:43.809
Otherwise they are supposed to be intellectuals,
otherwise they are supposed to be analytical,

00:07:43.809 --> 00:07:47.389
otherwise they are supposed to be something
very brainy.

00:07:47.389 --> 00:07:55.939
But when it comes to temples and churches,
when it come to religion, when it comes to

00:07:55.939 --> 00:08:05.929
Christianity, I think their brains are blocked,
completely blocked, by some sort of a mesmerism.

00:08:05.929 --> 00:08:15.479
They just can’t think that there could be
something very wrong with these people.

00:08:15.479 --> 00:08:25.099
When living in Italy, I found or I was shocked
how this catholic church was working out and

00:08:25.099 --> 00:08:33.149
what the priests were doing and all kinds
of scandals much more than we have in our

00:08:33.149 --> 00:08:34.149
country!

00:08:34.149 --> 00:08:44.000
Money bungling and molesting women and having
children – I mean every sort of dirty habit

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.329
they had.

00:08:45.329 --> 00:08:46.829
Supposed to be priests.

00:08:46.829 --> 00:08:54.069
They were called ‘fathers’, they were
called ‘mothers’, they were called ‘sisters’,

00:08:54.069 --> 00:08:56.490
they were called ‘brothers’.

00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:05.220
And to me it was really a shock – I didn’t
know that such things are happening in the

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:10.310
name of Christ.

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:17.060
What Christ tried to show through his birth:
there is no need to have very comfortable,

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:25.829
great birth in a big hospital in London, no!

00:09:25.829 --> 00:09:36.740
The simplicity of his birth should have made
all the Christians extremely simple and not

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:39.110
at all money oriented.

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:45.709
For money they went all round, crushed so
many people all over the world, when you go

00:09:45.709 --> 00:09:57.709
to Brazil or to Chile or to Argentina, you
do not find a single man belonging to the

00:09:57.709 --> 00:10:04.470
aboriginal people and they’re so unkind
to them.

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:11.240
Unbelievable how aggressive these people are.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:17.410
Even in England, where theres protestants
I find the same thing among them.

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:23.740
You must go on saying “thank you, thank
you” morning till evening, otherwise you

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:25.510
are finished.

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:26.510
Racialism.

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:31.700
What was the race of Christ?

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:33.279
Was he a fair man?

00:10:33.279 --> 00:10:34.279
No!

00:10:34.279 --> 00:10:35.279
Was he a white person?

00:10:35.279 --> 00:10:37.670
Not at all!

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:38.850
What was His colour?

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:41.759
He was brown like Indians.

00:10:41.759 --> 00:10:48.889
From where does this racialism come to these
Westerners?

00:10:48.889 --> 00:10:51.550
I just don’t understand.

00:10:51.550 --> 00:11:00.529
It has nothing to do with Christ or if it
is real Christianity.

00:11:00.529 --> 00:11:09.170
You go anywhere, you’ll be surprised, how
the faithful, simple-hearted people are misused

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:11.329
by these churches.

00:11:11.329 --> 00:11:22.860
They’re used for voting, they’re used
for money, for everything – to such an extent

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:36.350
that money was made, artificially counterfeited
in billions, by the church itself.

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:49.480
Such autocracy, such control, such authority
they had that whatever they did was, the pope

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:54.950
is infallible, whatever he does is alright.

00:11:54.950 --> 00:12:04.779
No idea of sinning, no idea of hell, no idea
of Christ – which was nothing but purity

00:12:04.779 --> 00:12:08.920
and innocence.

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:17.870
Christ had taken a hunter and hit all the
people who were selling in front of the temple,

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:19.970
because God cannot be sold.

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:23.930
They were not selling God, they were selling
only goods, but he said the respect of the

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:30.720
temple, talked about the respect of the temple.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:37.560
Another great thing Christians have done,
is to blame Jews for killing Christ.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:38.560
Wonderful!

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:48.639
Put all the blame on others, this is the speciality
of Christians even today, is to put the blame

00:12:48.639 --> 00:12:51.890
of what wrong you are doing on others, very
common.

00:12:51.890 --> 00:13:01.949
And this is what you see very clearly in those
countries, who call themselves Christians.

00:13:01.949 --> 00:13:03.379
They blamed Jews.

00:13:03.379 --> 00:13:10.190
First of all, those who were Jews at that
time might have been Indians later on.

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:13.170
Alright, so they don’t believe in reincarnation.

00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:19.829
I mean to say the same Jews who were there
are born again.

00:13:19.829 --> 00:13:33.470
Thirdly that the Jews never killed Christ,
never, because in the multitude how can you

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:34.470
decide?

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:42.579
Is the judge who decided and ordered, he was
a Roman.

00:13:42.579 --> 00:13:50.180
So the Roman empire didn’t want to take
the responsibility of His death so they said

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:53.070
Jews have killed Him.

00:13:53.070 --> 00:14:02.490
So Mr Hitler got after them and he really
tortured them, really it’s too much, one

00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:12.740
can’t even understand how can – he believed
in catholic religion, how could he kill small

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:18.459
little children, in the gas chamber?

00:14:18.459 --> 00:14:29.069
But now the same people who were tortured
are also becoming very aggressive and now

00:14:29.069 --> 00:14:36.399
they are against the Palestinians and the
Palestinians on their own are Muslims and

00:14:36.399 --> 00:14:41.370
the Muslims are playing a havoc all over.

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:55.270
So when you go through the history, and see
the life of Christ, what do you find is aggressiveness

00:14:55.270 --> 00:15:02.310
from one to another, from that to another,
passing from one to another.

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:12.199
If somebody slaps somebody, the another person
will try to kill that person.

00:15:12.199 --> 00:15:19.589
So this religion has created this divisiveness;
people are just killing each other in the

00:15:19.589 --> 00:15:24.639
name of God, in the name of religion.

00:15:24.639 --> 00:15:30.010
Even in Sahaja Yoga, you’ll be surprised,
I have seen people taking advantage of my

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:36.449
name, and trying to get into some mesmeric
groups.

00:15:36.449 --> 00:15:40.180
I can’t understand.

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:46.199
Using my name, using my photograph!

00:15:46.199 --> 00:15:55.470
So beware this should not happen to you people.

00:15:55.470 --> 00:16:09.009
Using the name of Christ, the Incarnation
of Divine Love, they are doing all these works

00:16:09.009 --> 00:16:17.829
of violence, hatred, of cheating, I mean very
debased people.

00:16:17.829 --> 00:16:24.540
And from one to another it passes, to the
another it passes.

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:28.369
Same thing happens in Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:28.369 --> 00:16:34.209
If I told somebody that you are no more a
leader, somebody else is the leader, immediately

00:16:34.209 --> 00:16:42.309
that person gets angry, he forgets what good
sahaj has done to him, he just forgets.

00:16:42.309 --> 00:16:47.790
If I tell him the leadership should pass to
somebody else, finished!

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:54.759
Then he forgets that whatever good was done
to him, whatever Sahaja Yoga has done for

00:16:54.759 --> 00:16:59.980
him, he’s living only because Sahaj has
helped him.

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:04.240
So this leadership goes into the heads of
people.

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:12.600
Sahaja Yoga is not here to make leaders out
of you, no never.

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:21.569
It is just for convenience we have leaders
and if they become inconvenient we have to

00:17:21.569 --> 00:17:26.620
change it, that’s all, as simple as that.

00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:38.760
But still I find this idea of authority is
something very great and they start using

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:46.159
it left and right, everywhere it is happening
practically in every country, has happened

00:17:46.159 --> 00:17:55.700
and still happening
which is a very sad thing.

00:17:55.700 --> 00:18:01.230
This will never bring forth my efforts.

00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:09.460
My effort is to synthesise the whole, not
to divide, by no chance to divide.

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:22.640
Only thing, whatever is wrong, whatever is
unholy has to be brought to your notice.

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:30.649
See as a housewife, when we clean the rice,
there are some white stones in it, we take

00:18:30.649 --> 00:18:31.980
them out.

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:35.649
We don’t cook rice with that stone, do we?

00:18:35.649 --> 00:18:38.149
And such stones have to go out.

00:18:38.149 --> 00:18:42.010
So some of them are just like stones.

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:44.789
You cannot change them.

00:18:44.789 --> 00:18:53.260
Namadeva has said that they are like a fly,
who when lives gives us trouble by coming

00:18:53.260 --> 00:19:02.990
on our food and by making us feel nauseated
and if by mistake we take her inside in our

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:08.649
stomach, she is dead but still she troubles
us.

00:19:08.649 --> 00:19:11.950
These are all rakshasas, I should say.

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:18.179
They can never understand Sahaja Yoga and
they will always try to trouble us.

00:19:18.179 --> 00:19:25.950
But what must the people who have achieved
Sahaja Yoga should do.

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:35.029
Should they also take to such methods?

00:19:35.029 --> 00:19:40.370
I have never blamed anyone for anything.

00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:45.270
Like, people say, “Mother he didn’t give
any money to Sahaja Yoga so he has lost all

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:46.270
his money.”

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:50.289
I never say like that “He should have donated
some money!”

00:19:50.289 --> 00:19:52.980
I never ask for donations, I never ask for
money.

00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:56.480
Every time I say it’s all sufficient.

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:57.480
Don’t need.

00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:11.549
I have never asked for a single pie from anyone
to be given to me even when I needed

00:20:11.549 --> 00:20:22.000
because I know I don’t have that problem.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.149
From the life of Christ one has to understand.

00:20:25.149 --> 00:20:27.890
He had no problems.

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:30.710
He was fearless.

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:33.470
He knew he was the son of God.

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:35.559
He had no problems at all.

00:20:35.559 --> 00:20:41.330
He faced everything, even his crucifixion.

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:46.470
And people, I think, liked his crucifixion
or what?

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:49.720
They carry the cross.

00:20:49.720 --> 00:21:04.720
Of course is the transformed symbol of Swastika
no doubt but still.

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:11.940
He had to sacrifice his life.

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:24.210
He sacrificed his life for all the human being
not for only white or black, brown or blue

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:35.230
but he sacrificed his life for all of us so
that we could cross over our agnya.

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:42.720
The condemnation we should do is not of others
but of ourselves.

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:52.840
We can call that as a crucifixion of ours
by which we see as Sahaja Yogis where are

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:53.840
we going.

00:21:53.840 --> 00:22:00.160
I’m told there are some 80-90 Sahaja Yogis
who have come, who were mesmerised by some

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.160
people.

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:06.520
How could Sahaja Yogis be mesmerised?

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:12.610
Is it possible?

00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:22.659
They never must be praying, they may not be
doing meditation.

00:22:22.659 --> 00:22:26.090
How can they get into it?

00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:30.919
And now they are asking for forgiveness.

00:22:30.919 --> 00:22:35.340
I forgive but that doesn’t mean they will
be alright.

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:40.270
We cannot fix them anymore.

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:46.000
We do not put spoiled apples with the good
ones, do we?

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.390
This [is] no wisdom.

00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:53.690
They are already spoiled, and they should
keep out till I say.

00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:59.529
They should not attend any centre, they should
not come to any puja.

00:22:59.529 --> 00:23:01.480
They should let them cleanse themselves.

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:08.419
Though a rotten apple cannot get well they
can.

00:23:08.419 --> 00:23:14.360
They should try to understand that they were
not Sahaja Yogis.

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:24.029
If a Sahaja Yogi can get mesmerised, then
what’s the use of doing Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:24.029 --> 00:23:32.340
What’s the use of getting your Kundalini
raised?

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:40.210
That means that they are very poor Sahaja
Yogis.

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:49.750
Surprisingly I have not seen this kind of
a phenomena in the west, very surprising!

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:56.679
Western Sahaja Yogis, whatever they were,
they are great Sahaja Yogis, I must say if

00:23:56.679 --> 00:24:03.220
you consider the number of good people there.

00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:07.730
They have given up so-called Christianity,
they have given up all this nonsense, drinking,

00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:14.019
drugs, womanising, everything they have given
up.

00:24:14.019 --> 00:24:22.769
And I haven’t met one person who has taken
to drinking again or who has taken even to

00:24:22.769 --> 00:24:24.860
smoking.

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:30.960
This Yoga bhoomi of yours, which is India.

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:34.149
How could it happen here?

00:24:34.149 --> 00:24:36.990
Specially in Maharashtra.

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:44.299
I think some devilish people are born in this
Maharashtra all the time because how is it

00:24:44.299 --> 00:24:53.070
they tortured each and every saint?

00:24:53.070 --> 00:25:00.220
How?

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:09.490
How is it, they have been so much enticed
by somebody who is saying something which

00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:16.750
I have never said?

00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:27.320
Shows a very low type of people, very low.

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:36.130
And they must have been always being born
in this Maharashtra, I am sure and again they

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:44.160
are born today.

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:52.750
I never wanted to talk about this at the jubilant
time like this when Christ was born.

00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:59.840
Yes, it’s a thing of jubilation because
He came as a Saviour.

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:04.120
He did everything that is possible under the
sun.

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:16.620
For us it’s alright but what about Him,
what did we give Him?

00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:22.320
In the same way many Sahaja Yogis go on demanding,
Mother we can’t even meet you, we can’t

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:28.039
even shake hands with you, we can’t even
fall at your feet.

00:26:28.039 --> 00:26:32.090
We can’t do this, we can’t do that.

00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:33.559
It surprises me.

00:26:33.559 --> 00:26:38.460
“You must do this, You must do that.”

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:44.390
All the time lecturing to me.

00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:47.899
What you must do?

00:26:47.899 --> 00:26:58.530
You must do, is to meditate and to believe
that this Paramchaitanya is My power and that

00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:02.059
you have felt My power within you.

00:27:02.059 --> 00:27:06.350
The more you are away from you the better
you will be.

00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:18.679
Absolutely, I can’t understand the demanding
nature of some Sahaja Yogis.

00:27:18.679 --> 00:27:28.710
They have got their Jagruti (awakening of
Kundalini) which would never have happened.

00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:34.490
If Christ wanted, He would have killed all
of them and lived very well, but I think He

00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:51.220
must have been fed up with the stupidity all
around.

00:27:51.220 --> 00:28:00.500
So at this time, we have to understand that
such a great Incarnation came on this earth.

00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:03.180
Of course he couldn’t give Realisation.

00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:08.259
Imagine the people who were about to crucify
Him, how could he give realisation?

00:28:08.259 --> 00:28:15.840
Supposing somebody comes with the dagger at
Me, can I give them realisation?

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:19.409
It’s all right.

00:28:19.409 --> 00:28:23.100
Nobody listened to Them, nobody thought anything
of them but not you!

00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:26.010
You people have got your realisation.

00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:27.570
You are born again people.

00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:29.429
You are great people.

00:28:29.429 --> 00:28:31.000
Your potential is there.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:36.739
Instead of utilising that now, what are you
doing?

00:28:36.739 --> 00:28:41.919
How many people are really involved in Sahaja
Yoga?

00:28:41.919 --> 00:28:42.919
Introspect.

00:28:42.919 --> 00:28:47.100
They have their own business, they have their
own this thing, they have – How many are

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:49.770
really involved in Sahaja Yoga?

00:28:49.770 --> 00:29:01.169
He had only twelve disciples, except for one
or two, all of them dedicated without realisation,

00:29:01.169 --> 00:29:08.509
dedicated fully to the work of Christianity
and which spread because they had not much

00:29:08.509 --> 00:29:11.220
idea about the whole thing.

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:19.630
The Christians that they had were just converts,
useless people

00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:26.390
and I would say that if they did not do any
justice to the birth of Christ, one can understand.

00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:30.940
But what about you people?

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:44.750
Who are born twice, who have got their self
Knowledge, who are so equipped with all the

00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:56.159
powers, who are connected with this all power,
what you can call the power of Divine Love?

00:29:56.159 --> 00:30:07.690
All your powers can be utilised, can be known.

00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:13.740
It’s like some dynamic machine which has
started.

00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:26.549
Few wheels are moving but there are so many
wheels after wheels and so much you can do.

00:30:26.549 --> 00:30:33.610
I cannot blame the Christians who are so stupid
because after all they never got their awakening.

00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:41.409
Only some priest would bring some water, put
it on their head and baptised them, finished.

00:30:41.409 --> 00:30:45.909
But what about you people?

00:30:45.909 --> 00:30:51.440
I have lived because of you, because I wanted
to see that you people mature.

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:57.420
That’s the idea of the Mother is.

00:30:57.420 --> 00:31:05.580
There are many who are matured, I would not
say, but still many have to be matured.

00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:11.429
Doesn’t mean that you should be able to
give big lectures, or write books or anything.

00:31:11.429 --> 00:31:14.389
But within yourself you should mature.

00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:32.929
Your own personality should flower into the
fragrance of love of divinity.

00:31:32.929 --> 00:31:36.990
This is what I would say is the difference
between Me and Christ.

00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:41.570
He said “Baba I had enough, No, No, No more!

00:31:41.570 --> 00:31:45.820
With these stupid people.”

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:49.799
Not Me, I knew what was the world like.

00:31:49.799 --> 00:31:52.460
I knew what had happened to this world.

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:59.070
Today the world is much worse, because all
the religions are fighting among themselves,

00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:00.450
firstly.

00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:08.330
All the politicians are trying to be very
badly corrupt, competing in that corruption.

00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:14.300
Nobody has sense of truth and honesty.

00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:25.720
Everybody is involved in the advertisement,
newspapers, media, this, that, which is the

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:28.460
most corrupting influence today.

00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:39.990
With all this background, I know by the year
2000, Sahaja Yoga will come out in the whole

00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:52.749
world as something very great…(applause)
– You did not allow me to complete the sentence

00:32:52.749 --> 00:32:58.620
– if you people become real Sahaja Yogis.

00:32:58.620 --> 00:32:59.700
All of you.

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:05.799
All of you who are attending to Me here.

00:33:05.799 --> 00:33:09.510
Even this much group if it becomes real Sahaja
Yogis.

00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:13.789
It doesn’t matter if I cannot meet you personally.

00:33:13.789 --> 00:33:17.120
It doesn’t matter if I cannot go to your
places.

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:20.019
It doesn’t matter, nothing matters.

00:33:20.019 --> 00:33:26.600
Christ’s disciples worked when he never
existed.

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:35.210
So it’s not important, what is important
is that you are the people who are responsible

00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:41.070
for the emancipation of this world, for the
synthesis of this world, to bring peace and

00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:43.830
joy and happiness to people.

00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:50.299
Just now when I was coming, people spread
the shawls.

00:33:50.299 --> 00:33:59.720
It reminded Me of Christ when he came, they
brought palms leaves to wish him and spread

00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:03.990
their shawls on the ground for him to go,
and where does he go?

00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:04.990
To Gallows.

00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:13.270
He goes to cross, he goes for his death.

00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:21.690
When you show your love for Me, you have to
know that you have to love the whole work

00:34:21.690 --> 00:34:22.970
of Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:22.970 --> 00:34:30.490
It’s not some personal relationship with
Me that is going to work out.

00:34:30.490 --> 00:34:35.030
All these western countries in the influence
of Christianity will go down, you will see.

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:38.330
They are going down already because there’s
is no morality.

00:34:38.330 --> 00:34:45.320
There’s recession, all kinds of problems,
their children are wavered, they are drinking,

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:47.520
smoking, doing all kinds of things.

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:50.820
Even their influence on us is corrupting us.

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:54.060
Antichrist activity, throughout if you find.

00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:56.700
It’s nothing but antichrist activity.

00:34:56.700 --> 00:35:00.850
Who is the Antichrist?

00:35:00.850 --> 00:35:05.630
They are describing he is the antichrist,
that fellow is the Antichrist.

00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:07.000
That’s not the thing.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:16.870
There is an antichrist within us, who accepts
all these things which are against the purity

00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:22.240
and love of Christ.

00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:26.780
So first of all among yourselves.

00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:30.300
What is he going?

00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:33.070
Sit down!

00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:39.430
You must teach your children some manners.

00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:44.600
This girl who was drowned is because you neglected
the child.

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:45.790
The father, where was he?

00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:46.790
I don’t know.

00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:52.930
I can’t understand how can a child be left
like that.

00:35:52.930 --> 00:36:02.920
It’s important to discipline your children.

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:08.150
…if you have a neighbour, you’ve had it.

00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:15.131
He will try to find out where you go, what
you do.

00:36:15.131 --> 00:36:24.610
He will have a binocular to see and you make
any noise, you are finished but even if you

00:36:24.610 --> 00:36:28.490
sing, you are finished.

00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:30.060
In that way, Indians are better.

00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:33.950
They don’t have that noise difficulty.

00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:35.390
We don’t have.

00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:36.730
Indians can live in the noise.

00:36:36.730 --> 00:36:42.230
I wanted to find out why Indians are so adjustable
to noise.

00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:45.120
They don’t mind noise.

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:53.870
I found out the reason is that in the west
people are under stress and strain and that’s

00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:55.540
why they can’t bear.

00:36:55.540 --> 00:37:00.420
But in India, people don’t know what is
stress and strain is.

00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:05.952
Still that has not developed, I don’t know
how to that extent.

00:37:05.952 --> 00:37:08.040
That disease has not come.

00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:14.160
That might be the reason that they are so
much frightened of noises.

00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:16.590
People will come from villages here.

00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:21.190
They’ll sleep on the station, nothing happens.

00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:27.040
The trains are coming and going, nicely sleeping.

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:34.370
Imagine in the west, thank God, in Italy we
have neighbours little far away, we had a

00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:35.370
little trouble.

00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:40.510
But in England, we had to go on changing our
ashram from one place to another, run away

00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:45.460
from here to there, because of great neighbours,
we had one of them had the name Mr Peace.

00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:51.110
I don’t know who gave him that name.

00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:54.340
Such contradictions in life.

00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:56.890
Such horrible contradictions.

00:37:56.890 --> 00:38:07.370
I don’t know how will they learn how to
love their neighbour.

00:38:07.370 --> 00:38:10.020
But Indians do.

00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:15.580
Somehow they don’t have this problem, not
much.

00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:17.400
Sometimes they have but not so much.

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:27.350
But if there is a music supposing, all the
neighbours will join, bring tea, bring this,

00:38:27.350 --> 00:38:31.600
they’ll be enjoying the music.

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:37.560
But there the collectivity is so little I
think, I can’t understand how can they call

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:38.940
themselves Christians.

00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:50.140
Only they go to church, well dressed and our
Mayor told Me that for fifteen minutes hardly

00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:51.890
we can sit.

00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:55.050
We start looking at the watches.

00:38:55.050 --> 00:38:56.400
Fifteen minutes.

00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:05.120
And after half an hour, we all run out of
the jail and how is it these people are sitting

00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:07.020
with you for hours together.

00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:14.350
I said, I must be mesmerising them.

00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:20.160
I mean they are not so collective, unless
and until they drink, they cannot be collective.

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:24.770
Unless and until they get intoxicated, they
cannot talk to each other.

00:39:24.770 --> 00:39:28.990
They are all the time tired.

00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:30.700
They are supposed to be Christians.

00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:39.700
They are so tired, you see them in the films
or anywhere, they come and sit down “hah!”.

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:41.700
What has happened?

00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:43.690
Young people.

00:39:43.690 --> 00:39:48.500
All the time thinking, thinking, thinking,
which comes from Agya.

00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:58.030
Which comes from anti-Christ activity!

00:39:58.030 --> 00:40:00.120
Anti-Christ activity, thinking, thinking,
thinking.

00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:02.660
What should we do tomorrow?

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:06.780
What is to be done and all that.

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:20.660
Still we have to hope that this kind of religion
will finish.

00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:23.560
All such religions must finish.

00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:25.830
They have to go now, it’s too much.

00:40:25.830 --> 00:40:31.530
you cannot support them.

00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:39.410
They are so much full of anti-religious temperament
that you just can’t bear them.

00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:51.240
Better to finish Islam, Hinduism, Christianity,
Sikhism, Buddhism, Jainism, all isms one after

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:55.040
another.

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:58.220
To what religion did Christ belong?

00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:03.520
I don’t know.

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:07.940
You belong to one religion which is Sahaj.

00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:12.600
Which is the universal religion, which is
the pure religion, which is born within you.

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:21.740
You don’t belong to any other religion because
there is no religion in that.

00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:39.550
So by the time 2000 years, I hope all these
religions will run away from this earth.

00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:44.340
(applause).

00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:55.230
All of them fighting for nothing at all, killing
each other for nothing at all.

00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:59.820
They want, they want to fight, they like to
fight.

00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:06.780
Why blame Koran, why blame Bible, why blame
Christ, why blame anyone.

00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:08.090
They want to fight.

00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:11.490
They are of divisive nature.

00:42:11.490 --> 00:42:17.640
They want to have separate nations, separate
communities, separate this.

00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:23.410
Once you start separating you are antichrist.

00:42:23.410 --> 00:42:24.730
Absolutely.

00:42:24.730 --> 00:42:38.700
In Sahaja Yoga also I say that you are one
identity, you are not separate country, separate

00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:46.590
organisation, separate this, doesn’t exist
in my own idea.

00:42:46.590 --> 00:42:48.310
Doesn’t exist.

00:42:48.310 --> 00:42:53.440
I never thought of it.

00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:59.890
We are all children of one Father and of one
Mother.

00:42:59.890 --> 00:43:04.200
We have no business to think we are separate.

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:08.110
Even now, I have seen groups are made very
easily.

00:43:08.110 --> 00:43:09.110
How?

00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:15.940
The groups are made.

00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:30.780
Like I find Maharashtrians

00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:39.390
are sitting together (Mother talks briefly
in Marathi.)

00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:47.090
Then we have group of the North Indians.

00:43:47.090 --> 00:43:53.680
Indians are quite separatist I tell you, somehow,
by temperament.

00:43:53.680 --> 00:44:00.060
North Indians also have separate separate
ideas.

00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:03.200
“You must come to Indore.”

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:06.040
Why?

00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:07.920
Is it not a part of India?

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:11.360
They can’t come to Delhi?

00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:16.360
“You must come to Kanpur, You must come
to Allahabad, you must come to Indore.”

00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:21.220
You must go to every village, every place.

00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:22.270
Why?

00:44:22.270 --> 00:44:35.750
You are born today in Delhi, tomorrow you
will be born in some horrid place, then, “This

00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:39.040
place is mine.

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:41.300
This is my house..must come to my house.”

00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:42.660
That’s another headache.

00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:44.180
“You must come to my house.”

00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:48.840
Mine, mine, mine, mine.

00:44:48.840 --> 00:45:02.670
Once you start that, you are finished, you
are no more belonging to Christ, no more.

00:45:02.670 --> 00:45:09.011
This is a very, very common programme – even
today that, if you see around yourself, must

00:45:09.011 --> 00:45:13.340
be people from your own country.

00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:20.820
Just see around yourself, are you sitting
with another people?

00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:22.360
Who is the other?

00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:26.930
In Sahaja Yoga, who is the other?

00:45:26.930 --> 00:45:40.930
We are all one and this unity we have to learn,
if you really love Me and Christ.

00:45:40.930 --> 00:45:48.060
All this groupism and all this has to end
now among Sahaja Yogis, must end.

00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:57.080
We are all one identity, we are all one living
body.

00:45:57.080 --> 00:46:00.250
We are all one living organism.

00:46:00.250 --> 00:46:04.420
We cannot say we are separate.

00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:13.870
Can this hand separate from the body, can
it exist?

00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:21.310
Once you start giving it up, you will be surprised,
you will have real enjoyment.

00:46:21.310 --> 00:46:32.480
But once you have all these ideas about my,
my, you can’t even enjoy Sahaja Yoga.

00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:44.600
Cannot enjoy anybody else – “my wife,
my children, my house”, my this, my that.

00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:48.790
That awakening has to come within.

00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:52.830
“I don’t belong to this country.”

00:46:52.830 --> 00:46:59.030
Many girls you see and boys have written,
“We’ll have Indian marriage.”

00:46:59.030 --> 00:47:04.120
Only the age of the woman is 35 years.

00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:05.120
Only!

00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:13.880
Now where will I find a husband for her in
India, must be some widower or somebody.

00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:15.700
Must have an Indian marriage!

00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:20.210
Can you beat that?

00:47:20.210 --> 00:47:23.090
Such people, is impossible to marry them.

00:47:23.090 --> 00:47:28.550
I give you choice, all right have a choice.

00:47:28.550 --> 00:47:36.460
I also have a choice – I can’t marry you!

00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:39.060
That is My choice!

00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:43.720
You have the freedom to say where you want
to marry – alright marry.

00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:49.430
But as far as I am concerned, I can’t marry
you like that.

00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:58.440
You have to marry wherever there is a good
match for you.

00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:04.800
Many Indian girls have married with Indians
boys, and have suffered a lot, such a lot,

00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:13.410
you won’t believe! (talks in Hindi briefly).

00:48:13.410 --> 00:48:16.220
Not in Sahaja Yoga any more!

00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:24.030
We have not been able to organise even one
marriage of a Hindustani with an Hindustani

00:48:24.030 --> 00:48:26.810
– not possible.

00:48:26.810 --> 00:48:31.470
That’s not the desire of the Divine.

00:48:31.470 --> 00:48:42.630
Why don’t you find in your own community
somewhere [the] same thing.

00:48:42.630 --> 00:48:45.030
As in India, is very particular.

00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:48.720
Very very particular.

00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:51.940
Like when my daughter was to be married, they
said “No!

00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:54.320
He his not a Shrivastava.

00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:59.410
If he is a Shrivastava also, he is not the
same Shrivastava.

00:48:59.410 --> 00:49:02.720
Even if he is the same Shrivastava, his this
thing is different!”

00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:03.720
I mean.

00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:05.320
I said, “Now this is going to finish”.

00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:11.580
Because I had all my elders living and they
were after me.

00:49:11.580 --> 00:49:17.550
I said “Whether he is a Shrivastava or not
Shrivastava I am going to marry them, finished!”

00:49:17.550 --> 00:49:20.270
My husband agreed.

00:49:20.270 --> 00:49:25.330
Same with my grandchildren.

00:49:25.330 --> 00:49:28.390
If you get Shrivastava, well and good, otherwise
forget it.

00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:30.980
Maharashtrians also same.

00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:40.050
Maharashtrians who have become Christians
[are] also the same, you be amazed, Christians!

00:49:40.050 --> 00:49:47.500
Now they are saying we are Dalit Christians,
means who were converted from the lower caste

00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:48.740
into Christianity.

00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:49.740
Now there is a new caste that’s come.

00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:54.960
Once you have become Christian, what is your
caste?

00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:58.540
You are Christian, not that.

00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:00.770
They are Dalits and they are higher Christians.

00:50:00.770 --> 00:50:08.800
They will not marry in the Dalit and Dalit
won’t marry in the higher.

00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:18.930
Supposed to be Christians, following Christ,
going to church regularly, well dressed.

00:50:18.930 --> 00:50:21.250
Even if they do not have a proper suit.

00:50:21.250 --> 00:50:26.750
They must wear like English some suit, borrow
it, and go to church because according to

00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:31.160
Indian Christians, Christ was born in England.

00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:36.820
(laughter) Really, you won’t believe.

00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:41.000
Unless and until you wear a suit and a tie,
you can’t go to the Church.

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:53.210
Can you imagine, anybody, going with a dhoti
to church? (more laughter) Impossible situation.

00:50:53.210 --> 00:51:01.560
Even in my time, thank God I didn’t marry
a Christian, but my own sisters and all were

00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:06.270
forced to wear veils and not the saris, wear
the frocks and the veils.

00:51:06.270 --> 00:51:11.110
Can you imagine the wedding dress.

00:51:11.110 --> 00:51:14.690
We, Indian women, can’t do without the saris.

00:51:14.690 --> 00:51:16.850
But they were forced.

00:51:16.850 --> 00:51:20.620
So many women married the way English marry.

00:51:20.620 --> 00:51:27.960
And I was amazed even the Japanese who are
Christians come to Australia and dress up

00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:38.500
like these English brides and get married
– because they are Christians.

00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:44.090
That shows that they believe that Christ was
born in England or what?

00:51:44.090 --> 00:51:54.480
Actually, for Christians it’s not necessary
to worry about any dress.

00:51:54.480 --> 00:52:00.950
All this nonsense comes from the West that
you must dress up like this, you must have

00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:03.290
your spoon here, fork here.

00:52:03.290 --> 00:52:11.610
Did Christ eat with fork and spoon?

00:52:11.610 --> 00:52:15.490
He was born in the manger.

00:52:15.490 --> 00:52:21.230
It’s impossible to understand these people
are Christians.

00:52:21.230 --> 00:52:25.850
So much worried about the spoons and forks
and they came to your house for dinner, they

00:52:25.850 --> 00:52:31.040
lift the plate to see from what company you
have bought it.

00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:32.950
[That’s] very important!

00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:34.870
Such silly people!

00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:39.640
I tell you they call themselves Christians.

00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:47.750
Christ was born in the manger and [they are]
so particular about nonsensical things.

00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:58.110
You see one must understand the greatness
of His birth, in which he has shown that he

00:52:58.110 --> 00:53:03.190
was born with the cows tied there and the
calves were there.

00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:11.680
He was born in the manger.

00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:18.310
Not only the Christians abroad but they are
also in India the same – you can make out

00:53:18.310 --> 00:53:19.850
a Christian in no time.

00:53:19.850 --> 00:53:27.950
See them on a Sunday morning.

00:53:27.950 --> 00:53:37.130
That way my father opposed it – he used
to wear kurta, because Christ wore kurta.

00:53:37.130 --> 00:53:43.210
He didn’t wear suit, did he?

00:53:43.210 --> 00:53:45.230
And so superficial they are.

00:53:45.230 --> 00:53:47.820
Nothing to learn from them.

00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:56.840
They will put here on top [a label written]
“Saville Row”, On top of the suit!!

00:53:56.840 --> 00:54:05.310
Such stupid people, I tell you, and the Indians
are following them left and right, I can’t

00:54:05.310 --> 00:54:06.530
understand.

00:54:06.530 --> 00:54:07.570
They are anti-Christ.

00:54:07.570 --> 00:54:12.410
Don’t follow them on these points.

00:54:12.410 --> 00:54:19.550
Indians have at least certain sense of dignity.

00:54:19.550 --> 00:54:29.490
If you have any, why should you wear a suit
on a May day here?

00:54:29.490 --> 00:54:30.960
In this heat?

00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:33.780
We are Sahaja Yogis.

00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:38.440
We have to wear a common dress of a common
man.

00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:46.130
Whom are we going to impress except for this
Paramchaitanya?

00:54:46.130 --> 00:54:58.740
They are extremely superficial extremely meticulously
particular about their dress, how they live

00:54:58.740 --> 00:55:02.340
and it’s really horrible.

00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:10.470
I have seen this and that is the reason I
think I should warn you.

00:55:10.470 --> 00:55:17.340
Don’t take to that culture, that is anti-Christ
culture.

00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:25.810
Absolutely anti-Christ in every way.

00:55:25.810 --> 00:55:33.480
In every way they have insulted Christ out
and out.

00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:38.510
You people should not anymore insult Christ.

00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:40.500
In a simple way you live.

00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:49.000
I mean now this sari, they forced me to wear
is like a big bag for Me but what to do.

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.730
Yesterday also they forced Me, today also
they forced me.

00:55:51.730 --> 00:55:56.350
I am supposed to wear all this because I am
Adi Shakti, supposed to be.

00:55:56.350 --> 00:56:06.430
If I was Christ, I would have been better
off.

00:56:06.430 --> 00:56:09.330
He was much more free than Me!

00:56:09.330 --> 00:56:17.830
Now, with all this what we have to know, what
is the message?

00:56:17.830 --> 00:56:25.180
What is the message of Christ?

00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:33.600
That you develop your spirituality, your divinity
by which you know what is the dignity of a

00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:34.960
Sahaja Yogi is.

00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:41.860
He was your eldest brother I should say.

00:56:41.860 --> 00:56:45.670
His lifestyle you should follow.

00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:51.620
Absolutely not afraid of anything, not worried
about any job, nothing, not worried about

00:56:51.620 --> 00:57:00.310
any business anything, absolutely free from
all worries.

00:57:00.310 --> 00:57:08.450
So many examples we have, beautiful examples
of his life, but when we see Christians, we

00:57:08.450 --> 00:57:21.290
try to reflect it as an expression of the
life of Christ and that is where we make mistake.

00:57:21.290 --> 00:57:33.180
They are, by no means they are for Christ,
they are, by no means, following Christ.

00:57:33.180 --> 00:57:38.690
So as Sahaja Yogis, we have a different culture.

00:57:38.690 --> 00:57:41.580
We have a culture where we respect morality.

00:57:41.580 --> 00:57:45.980
We have dignity, we have our own personality.

00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:55.480
We are fearless, we don’t tell lies, we
don’t cheat and we can never get mesmerised.

00:57:55.480 --> 00:58:09.230
So we have to have, now we can call it “the
Mother’s culture”, and which is not in

00:58:09.230 --> 00:58:16.270
any way showing off, or in any way taking
to artificial things.

00:58:16.270 --> 00:58:23.541
The whole thing will change, the whole concept
will change, whole idea will change, once

00:58:23.541 --> 00:58:34.920
you understand that you are now in “the
Mother’s culture”.

00:58:34.920 --> 00:58:36.990
Now they have forced me, so I am wearing all
right.

00:58:36.990 --> 00:58:40.750
You want me to wear, alright I’ll wear.

00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:48.830
But normally if you leave it to Me what do
I wear, you know that.

00:58:48.830 --> 00:58:52.650
Secret is out already!

00:58:52.650 --> 00:58:57.920
If you want to give me presents, give me,
I never asked you for presents, nothing!

00:58:57.920 --> 00:58:59.780
Forcing the presents on my head!

00:58:59.780 --> 00:59:02.910
Alright, for your joy’s sake you have it.

00:59:02.910 --> 00:59:04.580
What to do?

00:59:04.580 --> 00:59:08.280
But one thing I must request these Maharashtrians.

00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:17.180
They are not going to give me anymore, anymore,
again anymore what they call is the oti part.

00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:21.090
My oti is overfull.

00:59:21.090 --> 00:59:25.920
Absolutely, nobody has to give me oti.

00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:31.840
If somebody gets married, if somebody has
a child, somebody has anything, they’ll

00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:33.950
bring the oti.

00:59:33.950 --> 00:59:39.380
There is no need to give me any oti, you can
go to the temple, you give your oti there

00:59:39.380 --> 00:59:47.210
it is resold and resold and resold in between
the sellers who are Gujaratis, the brahmins

00:59:47.210 --> 00:59:53.170
who are the pujaris make money.

00:59:53.170 --> 01:00:00.570
So no more oti, nobody is going to give Me
any oti whatsoever.

01:00:00.570 --> 01:00:12.730
On a Christmas day I have to say one thing
– what did we give to Christ.

01:00:12.730 --> 01:00:19.320
And the second question what are we going
to give to Mother.

01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:21.560
This is very important.

01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:29.520
I don’t want anything from you, nothing.

01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:33.280
I am fully content with Myself.

01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:41.000
What I want is that you must dedicate yourself
to Sahaja Yoga, to truth and to love.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:56.830
I will be very happy and also not to talk
like, what you call, Christ has called them,

01:00:56.830 --> 01:01:01.550
“murmuring souls” – talking here there,
one saying there.

01:01:01.550 --> 01:01:04.800
All this.I don’t like at all.

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:06.400
I don’t like it and it should not be done.

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:10.480
If you do like this, you will fall, fall very
badly.

01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:12.320
This is the last judgement.

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:17.260
Either you‘ll go to heaven or you‘ll go
to hell.

01:01:17.260 --> 01:01:20.090
It’s already working out like that.

01:01:20.090 --> 01:01:22.870
So let’s see.

01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:25.650
Where are you?

01:01:25.650 --> 01:01:31.500
So I have to again and again tell you as your
mother, I have to correct you and tell you

01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:43.210
that remember this is the last judgement and
please, do not take anymore to the activities

01:01:43.210 --> 01:01:46.970
which are anti-Christ.

01:01:46.970 --> 01:01:53.640
You can judge within yourself – [whether]
whatever you are doing is not good, and for

01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:57.170
that, best thing is to dedicate yourself to
Sahaja Yoga.

01:01:57.170 --> 01:02:01.230
But not to make money out of Sahaja Yoga.

01:02:01.230 --> 01:02:04.570
Not to make politics out of Sahaja Yoga.

01:02:04.570 --> 01:02:13.680
But make Sahaja Yoga like a big, huge, big
tree and it will work out.

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:16.390
I know it will work out.

01:02:16.390 --> 01:02:17.650
You have the potential.

01:02:17.650 --> 01:02:19.240
That’s why you are here.

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:25.050
May God bless you all
