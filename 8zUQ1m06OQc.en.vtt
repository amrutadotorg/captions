00:11:09.624 --> 00:11:19.614
It’s nice to come back to America....now
there are lots of seekers in this country;

00:11:19.614 --> 00:11:20.614
lost.

00:11:20.614 --> 00:11:23.714
They are frantically seeking, no doubt.

00:11:23.714 --> 00:11:30.034
The are genuine seekers,...ave no doubt about
it....ame back after...ears; it was unfortunate

00:11:30.034 --> 00:11:35.094
because...as busy with other parts of the
world and...new I’d find them again when...ame

00:11:35.094 --> 00:11:36.094
back.

00:11:36.094 --> 00:11:48.104
It is for us to know first of all that if
you are seeking reality, if you are seeking

00:11:48.104 --> 00:11:57.674
the truth, we have to be very honest about
it; extremely honest.

00:11:57.674 --> 00:12:08.794
You have to know that unless and until you
find it, you should not believe anyone., You

00:12:08.794 --> 00:12:12.404
should nbot accept any surface anything.

00:12:12.404 --> 00:12:23.003
People may say anything....ay tell you that
you have to have your realization.

00:12:23.003 --> 00:12:34.423
That doesn’t mean that you have to believe
me...t doesn’t mean that at all.

00:12:34.423 --> 00:12:40.133
But you should not also deny me.

00:12:40.133 --> 00:12:50.194
Now, first of all we should know what we are
seeking.

00:12:50.194 --> 00:13:00.014
There has been never on this earth such an
urge to seek.

00:13:00.014 --> 00:13:07.314
So many seekers!...on’t know if you understand
that...eally different type of category of

00:13:07.314 --> 00:13:08.314
people...

00:13:08.314 --> 00:13:13.484
call them men of God...re born who are seekers.

00:13:13.484 --> 00:13:20.944
And they will go on seeking until they find
the truth.

00:13:20.944 --> 00:13:28.124
But one has to know what we are seeking.

00:13:28.124 --> 00:13:31.244
What are we to seek?

00:13:31.244 --> 00:13:37.574
It is said you have to become.

00:13:37.574 --> 00:13:40.874
You have to be.

00:13:40.874 --> 00:13:45.824
What do we have to be?

00:13:45.824 --> 00:13:51.584
We have to be our Spirit.

00:13:51.584 --> 00:14:00.344
Now we do not know what our Spirit is.

00:14:00.344 --> 00:14:05.394
The Spirit exists, no doubt.

00:14:05.394 --> 00:14:06.844
It watches us.

00:14:06.844 --> 00:14:09.754
We know there is...pirit.

00:14:09.754 --> 00:14:19.954
But how to bring that Spirit into our conscious
mind...nto our central nervous system...s

00:14:19.954 --> 00:14:24.974
the point.

00:14:24.974 --> 00:14:38.344
And when people know that there are such demands,
the market also gets filled with enterprise...s

00:14:38.344 --> 00:14:40.014
very common.

00:14:40.014 --> 00:14:48.664
Americans have the worst hit because you have
worse...ou have money.

00:14:48.664 --> 00:14:51.114
That is the worst part of it.

00:14:51.114 --> 00:15:01.904
And that’s how all of them are different
down here and they have exploited you.

00:15:01.904 --> 00:15:05.674
I’m sorry for all that.

00:15:05.674 --> 00:15:13.214
But...ust tell you that you cannot pay for
your realization.

00:15:13.214 --> 00:15:16.984
It’s an insult of God.

00:15:16.984 --> 00:15:20.004
How can you pay?

00:15:20.004 --> 00:15:25.284
How can you p[ay for His love?

00:15:25.284 --> 00:15:32.064
Do you pay to...ree when it gives you fruit?

00:15:32.064 --> 00:15:35.643
You do not.

00:15:35.643 --> 00:15:40.893
Maybe...erchant might take...ruit and settle.

00:15:40.893 --> 00:15:43.513
It’s much more than that.

00:15:43.513 --> 00:15:46.654
“How can we pay for it?”

00:15:46.654 --> 00:15:50.323
Is...imple question we should ask ourselves;
honestly.

00:15:50.323 --> 00:15:56.934
Then second point is, you cannot have courses
in God realization.

00:15:56.934 --> 00:16:02.184
What university did Christ go?

00:16:02.184 --> 00:16:05.323
He was...imple man.

00:16:05.323 --> 00:16:11.624
Did he go to any university?

00:16:11.624 --> 00:16:15.194
There is no understanding for us.

00:16:15.194 --> 00:16:20.603
That God is for everyone, whether you are
rich people or not.

00:16:20.603 --> 00:16:22.794
Whether you understand this language or that
language, God’s language is of love and

00:16:22.794 --> 00:16:23.893
it’s for everyone…

00:16:23.893 --> 00:16:25.374
every person….for every case.

00:16:25.374 --> 00:16:33.513
It cannot be for one person or one type of
people or of one category.

00:16:33.513 --> 00:16:39.864
But one category is there and they are the
seekers.

00:16:39.864 --> 00:16:50.034
Seekers is...pecial category; but only trouble
is they do not know what they are seeking.

00:16:50.034 --> 00:16:58.133
For this we have to divert to some authentic
people.

00:16:58.133 --> 00:17:01.564
For example, we should see now Christ.

00:17:01.564 --> 00:17:05.583
Christ said that you are to be born again.

00:17:05.583 --> 00:17:13.284
Last time, when...ame to America, they were
taping my speeches and all that in Los Angeles.

00:17:13.284 --> 00:17:23.404
And...as amazed, you see, that poeple objected
to it; felt they should not tape....aid, “Let

00:17:23.404 --> 00:17:24.934
them tape.

00:17:24.934 --> 00:17:27.994
What does it matter?”

00:17:27.994 --> 00:17:34.113
They said, “No Mother, they will publish
it."

00:17:34.113 --> 00:17:37.943
...aid, “Let them publish it.

00:17:37.943 --> 00:17:38.943
It’s...act.

00:17:38.943 --> 00:17:40.983
They should get it.

00:17:40.983 --> 00:17:44.064
They should get their relization.

00:17:44.064 --> 00:17:46.393
They are to be born again."

00:17:46.393 --> 00:17:47.393
But...as amazed!

00:17:47.393 --> 00:18:00.874
Then, they write books as if that was their
knowledge....on’t mind that either.

00:18:00.874 --> 00:18:17.643
But saying that you are to be born again and
they got...ertificate...

00:18:17.643 --> 00:18:20.443
sales certificate...hat we are born again.

00:18:20.443 --> 00:18:24.594
How can you certify yourslf you are born again?

00:18:24.594 --> 00:18:28.044
You have to be honest about it.

00:18:28.044 --> 00:18:35.453
If you are born again something special has
to happen to us.

00:18:35.453 --> 00:18:37.323
Like Jung has said that you have to become...ecome
collectively conscious.

00:18:37.323 --> 00:18:43.223
Not that...ay we are all brothers and sisters
and we are all one.

00:18:43.223 --> 00:18:49.994
No, you have to become that part and parcel
of the whole...s you say the microcosm.

00:18:49.994 --> 00:18:53.904
You have to become this microcosm...as to
become that.

00:18:53.904 --> 00:19:00.034
That means in evolution, your awareness has
to become something more.

00:19:00.034 --> 00:19:05.284
As an animal you see, for example, for an
animal.

00:19:05.284 --> 00:19:08.134
He doesn’t see any colors.

00:19:08.134 --> 00:19:12.643
He doesn’t see whether is filthy or good.

00:19:12.643 --> 00:19:14.483
But you do.

00:19:14.483 --> 00:19:26.404
I’m the same way, if you have to rise higher,
the change has to come in your awareness.

00:19:26.404 --> 00:19:35.203
That is one thing one should know...hat the
transformation has to take place in your awareness.

00:19:35.203 --> 00:19:40.644
And that is what one should see.

00:19:40.644 --> 00:19:44.023
Is there any transformation in awareness?

00:19:44.023 --> 00:19:50.994
For example, there is some lady who starts
jumping on the seat.

00:19:50.994 --> 00:19:54.723
I’ve seen some poeple who come to me.

00:19:54.723 --> 00:20:08.634
They just start jumping and they think they
have got realization.

00:20:08.634 --> 00:20:12.754
How can that be?

00:20:12.754 --> 00:20:20.954
You are not in possession of yourself.

00:20:20.954 --> 00:20:26.484
You have to be your own master.

00:20:26.484 --> 00:20:36.374
Here somebody is making you jump.

00:20:36.374 --> 00:20:44.864
Maybe you are possessed.You have not have
authority over yourself.

00:20:44.864 --> 00:20:50.734
You do not know how to control yourself.

00:20:50.734 --> 00:20:54.824
And how do you say that you have got realization?

00:20:54.824 --> 00:20:58.974
If you become self realized, you are not going
to be enslaved.

00:20:58.974 --> 00:21:03.674
You are going to get over all

00:21:03.674 --> 00:21:05.934
kinds of slavery.

00:21:05.934 --> 00:21:07.314
You have to be...aster.

00:21:07.314 --> 00:21:16.953
This should be the test of anything that you
are seeking.

00:21:16.953 --> 00:21:23.104
What have you got, you say?

00:21:23.104 --> 00:21:29.514
Are you emitting your own powers?...ay say
(as he has said it,...ean,...on’t know why

00:21:29.514 --> 00:21:37.064
Warren said this because...eldom start with
this kind of...hing); but if you wanted to

00:21:37.064 --> 00:21:38.453
see who said it.

00:21:38.453 --> 00:21:47.654
Now to say that...m such and such and such
and such is nonsense....ay be anything.

00:21:47.654 --> 00:21:49.314
So what?

00:21:49.314 --> 00:21:55.104
What did you get is the point!

00:21:55.104 --> 00:21:59.754
Did you feel yourself any more than before?

00:21:59.754 --> 00:22:06.463
Did you get anthing more than you have had
before?

00:22:06.463 --> 00:22:11.833
Not that you become crazy people or recluses.

00:22:11.833 --> 00:22:14.093
That’s not the way.

00:22:14.093 --> 00:22:20.814
You are going to become most normal person...as
to be extremely normal.

00:22:20.814 --> 00:22:26.744
And above all, you have to have complete control
of yourself.

00:22:26.744 --> 00:22:30.703
That is the minimum of minimums one should
know.

00:22:30.703 --> 00:22:41.283
But our idea about self realization is so
much spoiled and so many psuedo people have

00:22:41.283 --> 00:22:47.774
written., even about Kundalini....as amazed
when...ound out that such big, big books are

00:22:47.774 --> 00:22:48.774
written about Kundalini....

00:22:48.774 --> 00:22:56.054
saying it is in the stomache, some say it
is in the nose....

00:22:56.054 --> 00:23:00.013
it is here and there.

00:23:00.013 --> 00:23:03.484
It is not there!

00:23:03.484 --> 00:23:06.783
It is in the sacrum bone.

00:23:06.783 --> 00:23:11.104
You can see it yourself with your own eyes.

00:23:11.104 --> 00:23:16.054
When the Kundalini rises you can see the pulsation
just like...eart....

00:23:16.054 --> 00:23:19.454
not in everyone, of course.

00:23:19.454 --> 00:23:30.864
But in some poeple who have had an obstruction,
you can see with your naked eyes.

00:23:30.864 --> 00:23:41.624
You should be able to see it...appily...nd
you can also feel the pulsation coming to

00:23:41.624 --> 00:23:46.083
the head....ean so many pleople have said
it.

00:23:46.083 --> 00:23:56.783
There are people now,...m told, who are converting
people into Shikhism and this and that.

00:23:56.783 --> 00:24:00.984
And what is Shikhism?

00:24:00.984 --> 00:24:07.824
If you need...ead Kabir (sp ?) who is the
basis of Shikhism.

00:24:07.824 --> 00:24:16.634
He has said that you have to feel the cool
breeze coming out of your head.

00:24:16.634 --> 00:24:17.634
He says...

00:24:17.634 --> 00:24:19.854
(Mother quotes in another language).

00:24:19.854 --> 00:24:29.214
This means, on the head first of all, there
is the sound of Anahada, is this thub-dub

00:24:29.214 --> 00:24:35.973
of the heart and then you feel the cool breeze
coming out.

00:24:35.973 --> 00:24:41.904
Is so clearly said, but who reads those people?

00:24:41.904 --> 00:24:49.403
Those people who talk even of Hinduism and
all that, do they read Adi Shankaracharia?

00:24:49.403 --> 00:24:51.444
What Adi Shankaracharin has said?

00:24:51.444 --> 00:25:01.223
He has written books after books on Kundalini;
and not only, but on this Chaintanyita (sp?)

00:25:01.223 --> 00:25:02.833
he has written...omplete book.

00:25:02.833 --> 00:25:04.713
But people don’t read that.

00:25:04.713 --> 00:25:05.994
You get these...

00:25:05.994 --> 00:25:14.263
don’t know...xtracts and some sort of...on’t
know how they are not afraid of God?

00:25:14.263 --> 00:25:20.013
They are not afraid...ust to make some money...

00:25:20.013 --> 00:25:21.463
don’t know.

00:25:21.463 --> 00:25:29.314
Are they going to carry this money with them?

00:25:29.314 --> 00:25:33.713
It’s very, very wrong!

00:25:33.713 --> 00:25:42.504
It’s very sinful....on’t mind what ever
they do.

00:25:42.504 --> 00:25:53.494
It’s alright if they want to be smugglers
and all.

00:25:53.494 --> 00:25:58.994
There are many like that.

00:25:58.994 --> 00:26:04.494
But they spoil your Kundalini.

00:26:04.494 --> 00:26:05.703
You are damaged.

00:26:05.703 --> 00:26:09.874
And this is the thing which...m concernd about.

00:26:09.874 --> 00:26:11.384
It’s...ery sad thing.

00:26:11.384 --> 00:26:15.294
Coming to America is...eal _____?

00:26:15.294 --> 00:26:22.343
for me because...id send some of the people
who were really realized sould and they came

00:26:22.343 --> 00:26:23.343
here.

00:26:23.343 --> 00:26:25.254
They ran away within...ays.

00:26:25.254 --> 00:26:30.494
They said they will never recognize us...here
is...arrier...here is...arrier.

00:26:30.494 --> 00:26:33.404
They will never recognize Mother.

00:26:33.404 --> 00:26:35.144
They rushed back.

00:26:35.144 --> 00:26:40.104
They stayed in New York, one of them stayed.

00:26:40.104 --> 00:26:41.994
He ran away.

00:26:41.994 --> 00:26:44.523
He couldn’t stand it.

00:26:44.523 --> 00:26:48.954
He said, “They just want something else.

00:26:48.954 --> 00:26:51.473
They don’t want Ìod.

00:26:51.473 --> 00:26:54.644
They don’t want their spirit."

00:26:54.644 --> 00:26:57.283
Of course,...on’t believe that.

00:26:57.283 --> 00:27:05.513
These barriers are created to us because we
read about it.

00:27:05.513 --> 00:27:10.004
We try to understand through reading.

00:27:10.004 --> 00:27:20.723
It’s good, but you must come to...ight conclusion
through logical, logical understanding; not

00:27:20.723 --> 00:27:21.723
rationality.

00:27:21.723 --> 00:27:27.874
Rationality is something which can take you
anywhere.

00:27:27.874 --> 00:27:31.504
Rationality can give you...you can) rationalize
even...urder...nything!

00:27:31.504 --> 00:27:35.713
But, logically, you must understnd.

00:27:35.713 --> 00:27:41.864
Where should we reach?

00:27:41.864 --> 00:27:47.033
What should happen to us?

00:27:47.033 --> 00:27:49.804
As seekers, what are we expecting?

00:27:49.804 --> 00:27:56.023
This is...ery, very precarious and important
time...s more to say.

00:27:56.023 --> 00:27:58.984
The Last Judgement has started.

00:27:58.984 --> 00:28:01.153
That has started.

00:28:01.153 --> 00:28:08.723
That’s how you are all here and you are
seeking.

00:28:08.723 --> 00:28:15.723
The way it will judge, is the Kundalini has
to rise.

00:28:15.723 --> 00:28:19.024
Your have to become self realized.

00:28:19.024 --> 00:28:22.563
Then you start feeling your centers on your
fingers.

00:28:22.563 --> 00:28:33.494
Tomorrow...ill give you all the information
about the centers and all that and...ill tell

00:28:33.494 --> 00:28:37.454
you how He will judge you.

00:28:37.454 --> 00:28:42.074
What are your centers that are catching?

00:28:42.074 --> 00:28:53.584
And then you will judge that and you will
know what is the problem....

00:28:53.584 --> 00:28:59.614
how to get it done...ow to get it alright.

00:28:59.614 --> 00:29:03.654
There is no technique for _____?...ike if
you sow...eed it becomes...ree.

00:29:03.654 --> 00:29:05.683
There is no technique.

00:29:05.683 --> 00:29:08.734
If you have flowers, they become...ruit.

00:29:08.734 --> 00:29:10.004
It’s...iving thing.

00:29:10.004 --> 00:29:14.454
And living things don’t have any technique.

00:29:14.454 --> 00:29:25.504
But once you get connected, then you must
know the Divine laws and you must know the

00:29:25.504 --> 00:29:26.744
Divine technique.

00:29:26.744 --> 00:29:30.464
But first you must be realized.

00:29:30.464 --> 00:29:36.734
Unless and until you are put to the Mains,
how can you use this machine¿ You are not

00:29:36.734 --> 00:29:38.484
yet put to the Mains.

00:29:38.484 --> 00:29:40.484
How can you do anything?

00:29:40.484 --> 00:29:46.654
It’s like telephoning somewhere without
having connection.

00:29:46.654 --> 00:29:57.554
You must be connected., first of all to the
Divine.( but this is not...ifficult thing.).

00:29:57.554 --> 00:30:01.024
In modern times is very easy.

00:30:01.024 --> 00:30:07.284
Formerly, it was, like you can say,...ree.

00:30:07.284 --> 00:30:11.154
In the beginning you get only one or two flowers.

00:30:11.154 --> 00:30:15.183
But the time has come.

00:30:15.183 --> 00:30:17.563
The blossom time has come.

00:30:17.563 --> 00:30:22.234
Already today,...ent to see William Blake’s
drawing exhibition.

00:30:22.234 --> 00:30:28.794
And he said, “All your sins and blasphemy
and everything will be forgiven.

00:30:28.794 --> 00:30:32.084
All your sins will be forgiven."

00:30:32.084 --> 00:30:35.704
He has said about these days.

00:30:35.704 --> 00:30:44.904
He said that the God of _____?

00:30:44.904 --> 00:30:59.594
will become prophets and they will have power
to convert and transform others into prophets.

00:30:59.594 --> 00:31:03.494
He has clearly prophesized about Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:03.494 --> 00:31:07.394
Every word he has said about it.

00:31:07.394 --> 00:31:10.184
But people don’t read Blake.

00:31:10.184 --> 00:31:11.864
If you go

00:31:11.864 --> 00:31:18.664
and see his exhibition, you’ll be surprised
how in the “Pilgrim’s Progress” only

00:31:18.664 --> 00:31:24.754
he has given clearly how you face life.

00:31:24.754 --> 00:31:32.124
And there are some Sahjaja Yogis here sitting
down at your back here.

00:31:32.124 --> 00:31:37.033
And they have come from London and some of
them from Australia.

00:31:37.033 --> 00:31:38.033
And they could see.

00:31:38.033 --> 00:31:39.894
This is how you face it.

00:31:39.894 --> 00:31:47.054
But to get realization is the easiest thing;
to maintain it...ather difficult.

00:31:47.054 --> 00:31:50.284
But also that is possible.

00:31:50.284 --> 00:32:02.644
Now we have in London (you will be surprised)...all
at least one and one-half times bigger than

00:32:02.644 --> 00:32:03.794
this.

00:32:03.794 --> 00:32:06.944
And the hall was completely filled.

00:32:06.944 --> 00:32:11.624
And they rose up to sing...ong of Jeruseleum
which was...reat experience for me to see

00:32:11.624 --> 00:32:12.624
that.

00:32:12.624 --> 00:32:19.184
But( you won’t believe)...tarted the work
in England because my husband got elected

00:32:19.184 --> 00:32:20.534
to...ost there.

00:32:20.534 --> 00:32:23.894
That’s how we were there.

00:32:23.894 --> 00:32:28.944
And in the beginning,...as working with seven
people...even hippies,...hould say...even

00:32:28.944 --> 00:32:30.634
people for four years.

00:32:30.634 --> 00:32:42.714
And now of course, in the whole of England
we have many centers and lots of people have

00:32:42.714 --> 00:32:46.734
got realization and they are working it out.

00:32:46.734 --> 00:32:49.894
It’s working out very well.

00:32:49.894 --> 00:32:56.214
We have some people here from there who have
come.

00:32:56.214 --> 00:32:57.214
Dr.

00:32:57.214 --> 00:33:01.274
David is here and Hesta is...arrister.

00:33:01.274 --> 00:33:05.664
Then we have these two from Australia...r.

00:33:05.664 --> 00:33:07.594
Warren, who was...iplomat.

00:33:07.594 --> 00:33:14.994
And these two are American girls...oth of
them...h Christine...as been with me since

00:33:14.994 --> 00:33:24.134
long and Marcia who got her realization only
two months back, but she was so upright and

00:33:24.134 --> 00:33:26.504
so straight forward.

00:33:26.504 --> 00:33:32.404
And you should know that it is you who should
decide.

00:33:32.404 --> 00:33:37.394
If you say...m your Guru, alright...ccept
it for the time being.

00:33:37.394 --> 00:33:42.923
But...other is always...uru.

00:33:42.923 --> 00:33:57.784
If you say that your mother had to teach you
so many things...lso...ave to teach you some

00:33:57.784 --> 00:33:58.784
things.

00:33:58.784 --> 00:34:08.224
But actually, it is you who is your own guru.

00:34:08.224 --> 00:34:09.813
You have to become it.

00:34:09.813 --> 00:34:15.584
Unless and until you are connected, how will
you judge?

00:34:15.584 --> 00:34:20.364
Once you get connected, you will be able to
check.

00:34:20.364 --> 00:34:31.134
But you don’t think it is...ental activity
that is going to bring you your realization.

00:34:31.134 --> 00:34:35.244
No, God has placed everything beautifully
within us...verything.

00:34:35.244 --> 00:34:45.783
You have got your Kundalini very nicely placed
in the sacrum bone.

00:34:45.783 --> 00:34:48.084
Now, see this bone.

00:34:48.084 --> 00:34:54.913
Sacrum is...riangular bone called “sacrum”
so that Greeks know about this bone.

00:34:54.913 --> 00:34:58.234
They knew it was...acred bone.

00:34:58.234 --> 00:35:00.484
Sacrum means sacred in Greek.

00:35:00.484 --> 00:35:02.283
When...ent to Greece,...as surprised.

00:35:02.283 --> 00:35:06.334
They have the complete idea of kundalini;
complete idea.

00:35:06.334 --> 00:35:11.854
And they have this Athena also...eans the
Primordial Mother.

00:35:11.854 --> 00:35:20.234
In Sanskrit language, Athena...thens comes
from that and the way She was holding...erpent

00:35:20.234 --> 00:35:30.624
in her hand and everything...bsolutely She
is the Primordial Kundalini.

00:35:30.624 --> 00:35:43.574
And the whole concept was there and when...ent
into the study of that...ried to find out

00:35:43.574 --> 00:35:45.374
what it was....

00:35:45.374 --> 00:35:47.783
how did they know?

00:35:47.783 --> 00:35:55.774
They said we had some Indo-Aryian groups coming
down here and they told us these things and

00:35:55.774 --> 00:35:58.144
that’s how they know about it.

00:35:58.144 --> 00:36:01.624
But, that was all lost

00:36:01.624 --> 00:36:09.584
because they brought all the Gods to the level
of human beings and made alot of mess out

00:36:09.584 --> 00:36:10.614
of it.

00:36:10.614 --> 00:36:18.344
Now we have to know that how Christ was such
an important incarnation on this earth.

00:36:18.344 --> 00:36:22.804
We have really made...ess of the whole thing.

00:36:22.804 --> 00:36:28.024
He said that you are to be born again.

00:36:28.024 --> 00:36:33.683
Actually, he came on this center where you
see this red mark.

00:36:33.683 --> 00:36:38.054
You see...t is placed in the optic chiasma.

00:36:38.054 --> 00:36:42.894
In the center is...ubtle center called as
Agnya chakra.

00:36:42.894 --> 00:36:47.424
In the Hindu scriptures, He is called as Mahavishnu.

00:36:47.424 --> 00:36:53.394
But...ill tell about His advent when He came
on this earth.

00:36:53.394 --> 00:36:58.814
We say, He is the gate; he is the door.

00:36:58.814 --> 00:37:06.364
He is the door below the limbic area.

00:37:06.364 --> 00:37:12.834
And the limbic area is the Kingdom of God.

00:37:12.834 --> 00:37:17.064
Where one has to center, the attention has
to enter.

00:37:17.064 --> 00:37:22.554
How you enter into it...ot bodily, but your
attention has to enter it.

00:37:22.554 --> 00:37:25.294
Your attention is apread out in this area.

00:37:25.294 --> 00:37:38.384
But not there...t has to enter through that
area into the limbic area and ultimately,

00:37:38.384 --> 00:37:41.813
is the fontanel area.

00:37:41.813 --> 00:37:54.894
It becomes soft and the kundalini has to come
out and with the cool breeze, this is your

00:37:54.894 --> 00:37:56.443
actual baptism.

00:37:56.443 --> 00:38:04.394
Is not the baptism you go to some theological
college to learn and say alright...

00:38:04.394 --> 00:38:05.543
baptize...t’s all artifical.

00:38:05.543 --> 00:38:06.704
It’s absolutely artificial.

00:38:06.704 --> 00:38:19.144
That’s not the way you can baptize.

00:38:19.144 --> 00:38:22.494
You have to be...ealized soul to do that.

00:38:22.494 --> 00:38:26.154
John the Baptist was...ealized soul.

00:38:26.154 --> 00:38:33.374
He was the one who knew how to do it.

00:38:33.374 --> 00:38:36.783
And he did it for all of them.

00:38:36.783 --> 00:38:39.834
And that’s how it should happen to you.

00:38:39.834 --> 00:38:42.924
The kundalini has to rise and give you realization.

00:38:42.924 --> 00:38:47.594
Now the Christ advent came at this point.

00:38:47.594 --> 00:38:54.494
It’s...ery important one because today we
have brought the charts and all that but tomorrow

00:38:54.494 --> 00:39:01.173
we’ll be giving you, in...ull way, how the
ego and super-ego are sucked.

00:39:01.173 --> 00:39:03.704
They create...arrier here.

00:39:03.704 --> 00:39:08.374
Our ego and super-ego gives us our I-ness.

00:39:08.374 --> 00:39:10.153
We get seperated.

00:39:10.153 --> 00:39:17.114
When He’s awakened, this portion gets opened
out and then the kundalini can rise.

00:39:17.114 --> 00:39:22.214
That’s why it is said, Christ is to be awakened
within you.

00:39:22.214 --> 00:39:27.574
But it can be only done by...erson with Divine
authority.

00:39:27.574 --> 00:39:28.933
And such...erson cannot live on your money.

00:39:28.933 --> 00:39:29.933
He cannot be...arasite.

00:39:29.933 --> 00:39:31.544
Such...erson has nothing to do wioth money.

00:39:31.544 --> 00:39:33.793
How can you purchase such...erson.?

00:39:33.793 --> 00:39:36.023
Such...erson is beyond....

00:39:36.023 --> 00:39:39.754
beyond your purchase...eyond your money.

00:39:39.754 --> 00:39:43.214
You cannot do anything for such...erson.

00:39:43.214 --> 00:39:45.234
Such...erson just gives.

00:39:45.234 --> 00:39:47.254
He just gives.

00:39:47.254 --> 00:39:48.254
He emits.

00:39:48.254 --> 00:39:51.294
It cannot take anything.

00:39:51.294 --> 00:39:52.294
It cannot receive.

00:39:52.294 --> 00:39:53.693
It cannot!

00:39:53.693 --> 00:39:57.933
You may try, but doesn’t.

00:39:57.933 --> 00:40:07.634
One day...as walking...ittle bit, my foot
was...ittle twisted and one of the doctors

00:40:07.634 --> 00:40:16.543
she said, “Alright Mother, I’ll try to
massage it."

00:40:16.543 --> 00:40:26.933
Yet she was relaxing that side and...as saying,
“What’s happening to you?”

00:40:26.933 --> 00:40:29.454
She said, “Mother, what is this?

00:40:29.454 --> 00:40:37.433
Lots of vibrations are coming and...m just
massaging yourself and...m massaging myself....

00:40:37.433 --> 00:40:46.523
the way it is cooling down and soothing."

00:40:46.523 --> 00:40:51.663
So, such...erson cannot take anythging from
you.

00:40:51.663 --> 00:40:59.193
Now, the most important point which...ould
like to reach you is this: that we don’t

00:40:59.193 --> 00:41:02.464
realize hos precariously we are placed otherwise,
also.

00:41:02.464 --> 00:41:10.523
There are equal and opposite forces working
on us.

00:41:10.523 --> 00:41:17.974
For example,...isease like cancer....as surprised
to hear at this country, theere are patients...ne

00:41:17.974 --> 00:41:25.354
among four...f cancer disease....ave told
this ten years back, that cancer can only

00:41:25.354 --> 00:41:28.283
be cured through Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:28.283 --> 00:41:44.104
There’s no other way out....ave cured many
cancer patients and you can also cure once

00:41:44.104 --> 00:41:45.104
you get realized.

00:41:45.104 --> 00:41:50.653
How it happens...ow you cure cancer...ll this
knowledte you can have...ree of charge.

00:41:50.653 --> 00:41:53.324
Free of this thing.

00:41:53.324 --> 00:41:58.204
Actually, first you must get your realization.

00:41:58.204 --> 00:42:05.543
Without that, there is no use telling you
because you come into this room; it is all

00:42:05.543 --> 00:42:11.053
dark; you are blind; you cannot see anything.

00:42:11.053 --> 00:42:20.053
What’s the use telling you the size of the
room, and color of the chairs, and color of

00:42:20.053 --> 00:42:21.563
all this?

00:42:21.563 --> 00:42:24.594
No use telling you.

00:42:24.594 --> 00:42:33.374
Best thing is to open the lights and open
your eyes so that you can see for yourself.

00:42:33.374 --> 00:42:39.413
And the complete knowledge becomes your own.

00:42:39.413 --> 00:42:42.173
Then is better to talk.

00:42:42.173 --> 00:42:48.144
Otherwise supposing even though when you can’t
see,...o on giving you the complete history

00:42:48.144 --> 00:42:49.563
about electricity and about everything.

00:42:49.563 --> 00:42:50.994
You’ll be bored and stiff.

00:42:50.994 --> 00:42:52.424
And its of no use.

00:42:52.424 --> 00:42:55.454
First thing is you must get your realization.

00:42:55.454 --> 00:42:57.594
That is the first thing.

00:42:57.594 --> 00:43:01.024
Cancer can easily be cured by Sahaja Yoga.

00:43:01.024 --> 00:43:03.164
Absolustely there is no doubt.

00:43:03.164 --> 00:43:08.364
And there cannot be another doubt that it
cannot be cured by anything else.

00:43:08.364 --> 00:43:16.364
In our body, we have...articular system called
as...ympathetic nervous system.

00:43:16.364 --> 00:43:24.954
How this sympathetic nervous system goes into...errible
tension when we go to extremes of any kind.

00:43:24.954 --> 00:43:25.954
Say smoking, for example.

00:43:25.954 --> 00:43:26.954
Now smoking is...ery interesting thing.

00:43:26.954 --> 00:43:31.504
According to me, this America is the Visshuddi
chakra....

00:43:31.504 --> 00:43:35.394
is the center of this çenter.

00:43:35.394 --> 00:43:42.193
This center gets spoiked when we smoke and
the smoking is the maximum here.

00:43:42.193 --> 00:43:47.754
Like the Europe is the liver and there people
drink.

00:43:47.754 --> 00:43:54.834
And they are so much in it and their lives
are the worst of all in Europe.

00:43:54.834 --> 00:43:56.173
England is the heart.

00:43:56.173 --> 00:43:59.484
It (England) is lethargic....ean the whole
thing is in such...ess that...on’t know

00:43:59.484 --> 00:44:00.484
what...ave to face.

00:44:00.484 --> 00:44:02.793
But...as happy to know that now the smoking
is going down.

00:44:02.793 --> 00:44:04.614
But with realization, smoking just disappears.

00:44:04.614 --> 00:44:07.654
You don’t have to work at it.

00:44:07.654 --> 00:44:09.663
Marsha herself used to smoke alot.

00:44:09.663 --> 00:44:10.933
She told me....as amazed.

00:44:10.933 --> 00:44:12.844
But she has biven up completely.

00:44:12.844 --> 00:44:17.524
Drugs and all those things drop out just like
something unnecessary because...ransformation

00:44:17.524 --> 00:44:18.524
takes place.

00:44:18.524 --> 00:44:21.074
And the transmutation starts...hen the transmutation
starts, all these things drop out.

00:44:21.074 --> 00:44:26.234
You enjoy the best of health...est of your
heart...est of your miond....

00:44:26.234 --> 00:44:29.104
and your emotions come out.

00:44:29.104 --> 00:44:33.009
The best part of it is that this is what one
has to achieve....

00:44:33.009 --> 00:44:36.614
the whole humanity has to achieve.

00:44:36.614 --> 00:44:45.134
But the few who are the seekers have to do
it first.

00:44:45.134 --> 00:44:48.534
They have to do it first; they are the foundation.

00:44:48.534 --> 00:44:53.624
Like in every evolution, only...ew fishes
had to come out; then many came

00:44:53.624 --> 00:44:54.624
out.

00:44:54.624 --> 00:44:57.344
In the same way, few people have to do it.

00:44:57.344 --> 00:44:59.043
I’m happy there are...ew today.

00:44:59.043 --> 00:45:03.114
Though others are disappointed,...m not....m
happy because I’ll have to work harder.

00:45:03.114 --> 00:45:05.974
If there are too many, maybe difficult.

00:45:05.974 --> 00:45:11.803
As he said, it’s true that...ave realization
to six thousand people in...illage in India.

00:45:11.803 --> 00:45:13.234
But they are not complicated.

00:45:13.234 --> 00:45:14.674
See, they aren’t so complicated.

00:45:14.674 --> 00:45:21.803
They don’t live with the sorrows (word?)
you have here or the tensions you have....

00:45:21.803 --> 00:45:23.754
or the litigations you have....

00:45:23.754 --> 00:45:27.114
the problems you have....ave seen Indians
who have come here to earn money.

00:45:27.114 --> 00:45:30.704
They have all gone off their heads....ean
really, they have become half crazy.

00:45:30.704 --> 00:45:34.223
The gentleman with whom...m now putting up,
he told me already so many Indians have been

00:45:34.223 --> 00:45:35.223
under litigation.

00:45:35.223 --> 00:45:37.144
This happened, that happened and all kinds
of tensions are building up.

00:45:37.144 --> 00:45:40.324
Here, despite all our modern vest(word?) we
also have landed ourselves into terrible tensions

00:45:40.324 --> 00:45:43.393
of this machinery; this machinate and all
that.

00:45:43.393 --> 00:45:45.994
The villagers in India are extremely simple
people.

00:45:45.994 --> 00:45:48.224
They lead an extremely simple life.

00:45:48.224 --> 00:45:52.664
They have no complications....on’t say that
it would be so easy here as the way they have

00:45:52.664 --> 00:45:53.664
got realization.

00:45:53.664 --> 00:45:55.294
Of course, one has to work hard.

00:45:55.294 --> 00:46:00.934
Like we had about seven people....ad all of
them...t took about three hours to get realization.

00:46:00.934 --> 00:46:03.544
So, it could be that way also.

00:46:03.544 --> 00:46:07.064
It cannot be guaranteed; it cannot be promised.

00:46:07.064 --> 00:46:08.824
It cannot be certified.

00:46:08.824 --> 00:46:13.894
It has to happen...s the main point...s the
happening...s the happening.

00:46:13.894 --> 00:46:15.404
You have to become.

00:46:15.404 --> 00:46:17.284
It has to be actualized.

00:46:17.284 --> 00:46:20.733
It is not to be believed.

00:46:20.733 --> 00:46:24.213
That’s what you should know.

00:46:24.213 --> 00:46:27.514
If you are honest, you are to prove.

00:46:27.514 --> 00:46:31.453
And, you want to have it, you’ll get it.

00:46:31.453 --> 00:46:33.414
I’ll work very hard.

00:46:33.414 --> 00:46:38.993
It’s you who has to have patience with yourself....ave
all the patience and love.

00:46:38.993 --> 00:46:40.894
No doubt about it.

00:46:40.894 --> 00:46:45.733
But you all have to have patience....old you
seven people...as working for four years.

00:46:45.733 --> 00:46:51.664
Suppose its not going to be that bad, because
with them...orked out many permutations and

00:46:51.664 --> 00:46:52.664
combinations.

00:46:52.664 --> 00:46:57.634
Now,...now all the permutations and combinations
that are really harmful to people and how

00:46:57.634 --> 00:46:58.834
they are eradicated.

00:46:58.834 --> 00:47:02.034
But still...ould say...ould still have to
study some American complications which...o

00:47:02.034 --> 00:47:03.034
not know.

00:47:03.034 --> 00:47:09.483
Nine years back, people were simpler people
here and they are all mostly have gone away

00:47:09.483 --> 00:47:15.274
or also at that time the same thing is that...ould
not contact and everything works on money.

00:47:15.274 --> 00:47:21.284
You see you have to give them money so they
publisize you.

00:47:21.284 --> 00:47:25.094
Then they publisize you...hen you get more
money.

00:47:25.094 --> 00:47:29.374
Here there is no question of money, you see.

00:47:29.374 --> 00:47:37.204
You see my whole basic thing is you have to
get real people so the real thing, without

00:47:37.204 --> 00:47:38.204
money.

00:47:38.204 --> 00:47:42.994
And then, you cannot have...ig circus; you
cannot have...ig thing and it has to be started

00:47:42.994 --> 00:47:44.014
in...enuine way...n...eal way.

00:47:44.014 --> 00:47:49.764
They asked me that there is, there are agencies
who work out all these tings....aid to begin

00:47:49.764 --> 00:47:50.764
with...on’t think that

00:47:50.764 --> 00:47:51.764
this is important.

00:47:51.764 --> 00:47:53.834
We should work it out.

00:47:53.834 --> 00:47:54.834
Let’s see.

00:47:54.834 --> 00:47:59.274
There will be some people who feel attracted
and come.

00:47:59.274 --> 00:48:02.804
And let’s work it out this way.

00:48:02.804 --> 00:48:11.164
Still,...ould like your advice as to where
we can go, when, and in...ecent manner whenever

00:48:11.164 --> 00:48:12.164
we can advertise.

00:48:12.164 --> 00:48:18.934
Just now...ady told us that if you go to these
shops it will be good idea.

00:48:18.934 --> 00:48:21.074
We would like to invite people for this experience.

00:48:21.074 --> 00:48:22.074
This is your right.

00:48:22.074 --> 00:48:30.114
You are seekers and just like...ank, you have
got your bank accounts and you just cash it.

00:48:30.114 --> 00:48:40.594
And these are lots of places also.

00:48:40.594 --> 00:48:54.064
And whatever mistakes are done, don’t worry
about it.

00:48:54.064 --> 00:49:00.884
One of the big problems...aced in Englad is
that they all suffer from...enter or left

00:49:00.884 --> 00:49:03.084
visshuddi which comes out of guilt.

00:49:03.084 --> 00:49:04.684
You see, they are guilty all the time.

00:49:04.684 --> 00:49:08.064
Maybe Catholicism that makes them feel guilty,
but it’s...ery, very common trouble with

00:49:08.064 --> 00:49:09.064
them.

00:49:09.064 --> 00:49:10.064
They all the time feel guilty.

00:49:10.064 --> 00:49:11.453
Now, what are you feeling guilty for?

00:49:11.453 --> 00:49:12.453
We must suffer.

00:49:12.453 --> 00:49:13.453
Why?

00:49:13.453 --> 00:49:14.453
Why should you suffer?

00:49:14.453 --> 00:49:15.453
Christ has suffered for you.

00:49:15.453 --> 00:49:17.024
Did he leave anything for you to suffer?

00:49:17.024 --> 00:49:19.184
We whould be guilty about what?

00:49:19.184 --> 00:49:20.624
Why are you guilty?

00:49:20.624 --> 00:49:23.504
I’m talking of ocean of compassion...cean
of love.

00:49:23.504 --> 00:49:25.664
Now what guilt can you have?

00:49:25.664 --> 00:49:29.334
And is...ery big mistake to think that we
have done little mistake here and little mistake

00:49:29.334 --> 00:49:30.334
there.

00:49:30.334 --> 00:49:31.744
God has to save this creation.

00:49:31.744 --> 00:49:35.834
It is He who has to come in compassion and
has to do something about it.

00:49:35.834 --> 00:49:39.134
If He doesn’t save you, his creation is
lost.

00:49:39.134 --> 00:49:43.014
You shouldn’t feel like that inb...mall
way.

00:49:43.014 --> 00:49:48.354
It’s all very childish,...ould say, like...hild
to feel “Oow” after this mistake.

00:49:48.354 --> 00:50:06.223
But no...our Father is so great, is so full
of love you have to just look at Him and He’ll

00:50:06.223 --> 00:50:10.634
work it out.

00:50:10.634 --> 00:50:13.854
You should forgive yourself; that is one of
the things...ould request of you.

00:50:13.854 --> 00:50:17.894
First of all, before forgiving anybody else,
you must forgive yourself.

00:50:17.894 --> 00:50:21.764
That is the first thing you have to do before
realization.

00:50:21.764 --> 00:50:25.264
Of course, in one lecture,...annot tell you
much about it.

00:50:25.264 --> 00:50:27.374
This is just an introductory lecture.

00:50:27.374 --> 00:50:35.774
And we haven’t got our charts and all that
because first day, if you start seeing the

00:50:35.774 --> 00:50:39.424
charts, you (word?) mechanical and you think
it’s some sort of...omputer.

00:50:39.424 --> 00:50:40.754
You work it out.

00:50:40.754 --> 00:50:42.064
Actually, you are...omputer, you become...ivine
computer.

00:50:42.064 --> 00:50:45.554
But that’s...ifferent system and so it’s
better that we talk about it just now.

00:50:45.554 --> 00:50:48.874
And you get your realization; work it out.

00:50:48.874 --> 00:50:56.604
We are going to be here for some time and...ope
you’ll be able to follow my lectures and

00:50:56.604 --> 00:50:58.344
follow the whole thing.

00:50:58.344 --> 00:51:02.164
It’s such...remendous thing....ust tell
you about this in five hundred...00...ectures

00:51:02.164 --> 00:51:04.294
in London...t least...inimum....ay that every
time...peak.

00:51:04.294 --> 00:51:06.984
They say, “Mother, you are speaking something
now."

00:51:06.984 --> 00:51:10.344
So, you can imagine how much knowledge there
is there.

00:51:10.344 --> 00:51:13.084
But you are knowledge; you become knowledge
yourself.

00:51:13.084 --> 00:51:15.953
In Australia, the newspaper people were very
good to me because there was some happening....ady

00:51:15.953 --> 00:51:17.584
was very seriously ill

00:51:17.584 --> 00:51:26.364
and she had some sort of...ery serious stroke
and...riend of hers was...ig man at the newspapers

00:51:26.364 --> 00:51:31.074
and one of the Sahaja Yoginis there gave my
photograph to her.

00:51:31.074 --> 00:51:34.574
And she did get well from that...rom the photograph
only.

00:51:34.574 --> 00:51:41.954
So, this man started thinking about it and
then they did...ig publicity for me.

00:51:41.954 --> 00:51:51.664
So, it was lucky ,I should say, for Australians
and...as there for about one month or so...hree

00:51:51.664 --> 00:51:52.664
weeks.

00:51:52.664 --> 00:51:55.624
And we got thousands there now...housands.

00:51:55.624 --> 00:52:01.544
There are seven cities where we have seven
centers.

00:52:01.544 --> 00:52:07.364
It has worked....ust say, Australians are
very good for realization.

00:52:07.364 --> 00:52:14.864
It was surprising because certain people got
realization and settled down and they knew

00:52:14.864 --> 00:52:17.003
it was the trugh.

00:52:17.003 --> 00:52:19.984
That was the thing.

00:52:19.984 --> 00:52:25.223
YTou have to be intelligent enough to see
what i8s the truth.

00:52:25.223 --> 00:52:27.054
Don’t allow your intelligence to cheat you.

00:52:27.054 --> 00:52:29.394
Be careful about your intelligence...lso,
it can cheat you.

00:52:29.394 --> 00:52:33.014
But you should be really sharp about it to
see what is the truth.

00:52:33.014 --> 00:52:34.924
And wise.

00:52:34.924 --> 00:52:41.874
And that is what you are going to have.

00:52:41.874 --> 00:52:57.733
Now,...ould request you to ask me questions
because you see you all must be having lots

00:52:57.733 --> 00:52:58.733
of questions.

00:52:58.733 --> 00:53:04.554
You have your mind and you should better ask
because...on’t want whild we are giving

00:53:04.554 --> 00:53:12.884
you realization that you should feel that,
“Oh,...idn’t ask this question to Mother,”...though

00:53:12.884 --> 00:53:18.114
this makes no difference whether you ask me
questions or not.

00:53:18.114 --> 00:53:19.564
It is...ery different thing.

00:53:19.564 --> 00:53:21.854
It is beyond your mind.

00:53:21.854 --> 00:53:25.713
You go beyond your mind.

00:53:25.713 --> 00:53:31.124
You go beyond your mind; beyond your ego;
beyond your super-ego.

00:53:31.124 --> 00:53:33.184
You become something else.

00:53:33.184 --> 00:53:37.354
So if you have any questions, you can ask.

00:53:37.354 --> 00:53:48.574
Question: There are many people who come offering
realization.

00:53:48.574 --> 00:53:54.404
You come offering realization....ould like
to know something about this.

00:53:54.404 --> 00:54:11.134
In other words, you have something unique
to offer, is that right?

00:54:11.134 --> 00:54:23.193
Yes, of course...ould say...on’t know how
many have come here and how many have been

00:54:23.193 --> 00:54:26.414
thugs and how many have been real.

00:54:26.414 --> 00:54:31.234
But, actually most of them have been thugs
only because what they offer you...

00:54:31.234 --> 00:54:32.234
don’t know...

00:54:32.234 --> 00:54:35.584
have had people from other gurus...ll kinds
of gurus you see.

00:54:35.584 --> 00:54:38.184
And there are one or two sitting here.

00:54:38.184 --> 00:54:41.114
All of them have been to someone or something
like that.

00:54:41.114 --> 00:54:44.604
Now as...old you, the uniqueness of Sahaja
Yoga is this: Sahaja means...Saha” is with;

00:54:44.604 --> 00:54:46.034
“ja” is born...s born with you....

00:54:46.034 --> 00:54:47.574
is your own....

00:54:47.574 --> 00:54:48.914
within you.

00:54:48.914 --> 00:54:53.334
Now the uniqueness about it is this: that
it is what you are seeking.

00:54:53.334 --> 00:54:59.044
That’s what you are going to get....

00:54:59.044 --> 00:55:05.114
is your spirit....

00:55:05.114 --> 00:55:09.274
is that you become that...s the uniqueness.

00:55:09.274 --> 00:55:12.804
It’s not that...an say there is...ourse
of

00:55:12.804 --> 00:55:19.874
ten days...ou go through the course or you
pay for say...umping course or...o-called

00:55:19.874 --> 00:55:23.894
flying course or something like that.

00:55:23.894 --> 00:55:25.884
It is what you are.

00:55:25.884 --> 00:55:27.084
You become that.

00:55:27.084 --> 00:55:33.424
The uniqueness of it is that it’s...appening
which is...iving happening.

00:55:33.424 --> 00:55:40.554
You see, we don’t do anything that is...iving
work.

00:55:40.554 --> 00:55:44.514
What we do is...ead work.

00:55:44.514 --> 00:55:53.224
Like...ree died; we make chairs; we think
we have achieved alot.

00:55:53.224 --> 00:55:58.864
You see this wall is all made of dead things,
isn’t it?

00:55:58.864 --> 00:56:01.754
We have just changed the form.

00:56:01.754 --> 00:56:04.594
And these forms actually try to dominate us.

00:56:04.594 --> 00:56:09.604
This chair becomes...ort of an obsession for
us because we can’t sit on the ground....

00:56:09.604 --> 00:56:11.294
this...e have to use...hair like that.

00:56:11.294 --> 00:56:14.934
Now, anything that we do is all dead.

00:56:14.934 --> 00:56:17.814
Supposing somebody has to jump.

00:56:17.814 --> 00:56:23.004
Anybody can jump., What is there to be jumping?

00:56:23.004 --> 00:56:25.884
People pay money to jump.

00:56:25.884 --> 00:56:30.494
Can you imagine?...o take off clothes?...eople
pay money.

00:56:30.494 --> 00:56:32.804
How can that be?

00:56:32.804 --> 00:56:34.874
What is so great about it?

00:56:34.874 --> 00:56:37.364
We must understand: what do we become?

00:56:37.364 --> 00:56:39.144
What powers do we become?

00:56:39.144 --> 00:56:40.144
You see, there’s...uru.

00:56:40.144 --> 00:56:41.294
He says, “Alright,...ive you some knowledge."

00:56:41.294 --> 00:56:42.864
Now, what knowledge has he got?

00:56:42.864 --> 00:56:44.024
One gentleman came.

00:56:44.024 --> 00:56:46.334
He said, “I’ve already got knowledge."

00:56:46.334 --> 00:56:48.654
...aid, “What knowledge do you have?”

00:56:48.654 --> 00:56:51.414
For example, Warren can tell you where is
your chakra catching.

00:56:51.414 --> 00:56:56.794
Where is your kundalini; where it is obstructed;
how to raise it; how to bring it us; how to

00:56:56.794 --> 00:56:57.914
take it down.

00:56:57.914 --> 00:57:00.544
The he can cure patients.

00:57:00.544 --> 00:57:03.144
He must have cured...

00:57:03.144 --> 00:57:05.743
don’t know how many.

00:57:05.743 --> 00:57:10.253
You all can cure patientes and knowingly...hat
it is.

00:57:10.253 --> 00:57:12.993
What chakra is catching...hat is happening...hat
is the mental process.

00:57:12.993 --> 00:57:16.934
Everything, you know in your awareness.

00:57:16.934 --> 00:57:22.404
You become...ifferent person...s...ransformation
that takes place.

00:57:22.404 --> 00:57:23.954
You become master of yourself.

00:57:23.954 --> 00:57:26.034
To explain,...ill tell you...ery simple anology.

00:57:26.034 --> 00:57:27.774
Say we are traveling by....

00:57:27.774 --> 00:57:30.554
we are trying to learn how to drive.

00:57:30.554 --> 00:57:39.074
Now you have got an accelerator and you have
got...rake.

00:57:39.074 --> 00:57:41.454
You’re working it out.

00:57:41.454 --> 00:57:56.914
You see one, then another....e have two centers...wo
channels within us which...how tomorrow...ne

00:57:56.914 --> 00:57:59.014
for our actions.)

00:57:59.014 --> 00:58:08.914
So we start working both of these and start
managing.

00:58:08.914 --> 00:58:12.654
We go to extremes....

00:58:12.654 --> 00:58:25.074
this way...hat way...nd make all kinds of
mistakes...hatever it is...ut we try to balance

00:58:25.074 --> 00:58:26.074
ourselves.

00:58:26.074 --> 00:58:30.894
When do we learn the car driving?

00:58:30.894 --> 00:58:33.804
When we learn it.

00:58:33.804 --> 00:58:38.884
Once you have done that there the Master is...itting
at the back.

00:58:38.884 --> 00:58:44.894
And once He sees you have balanced it, He
gives you your place.

00:58:44.894 --> 00:58:48.334
You become the master of your being.

00:58:48.334 --> 00:58:50.334
This is what has to happen....

00:58:50.334 --> 00:58:51.334
the breakthrough!

00:58:51.334 --> 00:58:53.014
The breakthrough has to take place.

00:58:53.014 --> 00:58:59.534
Is not just...ake believe that, “Oh, we
have become like this."

00:58:59.534 --> 00:59:05.134
...ean there are people who believe they are
self realized.

00:59:05.134 --> 00:59:10.243
There are many like that, you see, that believe
that they are that.

00:59:10.243 --> 00:59:11.384
They are not.

00:59:11.384 --> 00:59:14.074
Because they should be able to tell.

00:59:14.074 --> 00:59:15.983
They should become collectively conscious.

00:59:15.983 --> 00:59:19.414
They should be able to tell where is the kundalini;
where is the problem.

00:59:19.414 --> 00:59:20.414
Now, for

00:59:20.414 --> 00:59:21.753
example, you are sitting....

00:59:21.753 --> 00:59:27.993
alright, now you do not know about the gentleman
next to you...here is the problem?

00:59:27.993 --> 00:59:29.753
Where is his kundalini?

00:59:29.753 --> 00:59:31.983
You cannot give him realization.

00:59:31.983 --> 00:59:47.284
But the people who are realized souls...ven
the small children...an do it...ery small

00:59:47.284 --> 00:59:48.414
children.

00:59:48.414 --> 00:59:55.864
They will immediately say, “This is the
center catching.

00:59:55.864 --> 01:00:00.664
Here...he finger...ittle children will show
the same finger.

01:00:00.664 --> 01:00:06.034
For example, if you have...roblem, say on
this center.

01:00:06.034 --> 01:00:07.034
Alright.

01:00:07.034 --> 01:00:12.693
All the children you put some sort of...hing
to close their eyes.

01:00:12.693 --> 01:00:15.604
And ask them, “Which center is catching?”

01:00:15.604 --> 01:00:17.264
They’ll all say this.

01:00:17.264 --> 01:00:19.304
All will say the same thing.

01:00:19.304 --> 01:00:22.324
And they also know how to correct this.

01:00:22.324 --> 01:00:25.344
Little, little children know how to correct
this.

01:00:25.344 --> 01:00:29.624
They are born realized and born realized children
are dynamic.

01:00:29.624 --> 01:00:34.894
And they know...o many born-realized children
are born these days.

01:00:34.894 --> 01:00:38.364
How will you know whether they are born realized
children?

01:00:38.364 --> 01:00:43.144
You do not know who is...alse guru and who
is...eal guru.

01:00:43.144 --> 01:00:44.943
You don’t know anything!

01:00:44.943 --> 01:00:46.733
There’s no discrimination power.

01:00:46.733 --> 01:00:54.183
But, if you want to know also about that,
you can just put the hands towards them and

01:00:54.183 --> 01:00:57.203
they can find out.

01:00:57.203 --> 01:01:00.983
Your vibrations will vanish completely.

01:01:00.983 --> 01:01:06.264
You’ll have heat coming from horrible gurus.

01:01:06.264 --> 01:01:16.574
If you see any horrible guru, you’ll find
very bad vibrations coming in that...ll burning

01:01:16.574 --> 01:01:21.154
and some of them just stop the vibrations.

01:01:21.154 --> 01:01:25.074
You just don’t get any vibrations from them.

01:01:25.074 --> 01:01:29.834
You can make it out from everyone what sort
of...erson he is.

01:01:29.834 --> 01:01:31.824
For example, there are athiests who don’t
believe in God.

01:01:31.824 --> 01:01:32.824
Alright.

01:01:32.824 --> 01:01:37.584
Now when they get realization they can ask
the question, “Is there God?”

01:01:37.584 --> 01:01:38.943
Tremendous vibrations.

01:01:38.943 --> 01:01:48.463
To find out relatively, we can say, take three
people...ne from...uru who’s horrid, one

01:01:48.463 --> 01:01:54.034
from...unatic asylum, and one who’s...ealized
soul, according to us.

01:01:54.034 --> 01:01:55.034
Alright?

01:01:55.034 --> 01:01:56.674
Now you put themn together.

01:01:56.674 --> 01:02:03.044
You’ll find the one who’s from the guru,
maybe feeling hot...ery hot...r may not get

01:02:03.044 --> 01:02:04.473
realization at all...aybe frozen...nything.

01:02:04.473 --> 01:02:08.473
The one from lunatic asylum may feel hot...orrible...ut
he may get well...e may get realization.

01:02:08.473 --> 01:02:11.144
And the third person, who is the one who is...ealized
soul will get only...ool breeze.

01:02:11.144 --> 01:02:13.144
We have cured many people who are meantally
like that...any have been cured...ou can cure

01:02:13.144 --> 01:02:14.144
also.

01:02:14.144 --> 01:02:15.144
It is you who become that...s the point.

01:02:15.144 --> 01:02:16.144
You become that...t’s your right.

01:02:16.144 --> 01:02:17.144
You have been seeking all your lives.

01:02:17.144 --> 01:02:18.144
Actually, it is impossible to believe that
there could be someone who does it just for

01:02:18.144 --> 01:02:19.144
loves sake.

01:02:19.144 --> 01:02:26.193
You can’t believe itr because it’s so
money oriented...he whole thing is so money

01:02:26.193 --> 01:02:27.193
oriented....

01:02:27.193 --> 01:02:29.253
that we can’t believe it.

01:02:29.253 --> 01:02:37.154
Even our parents; we think they love us for
money....ean, it has gone to that limit of

01:02:37.154 --> 01:02:38.154
absurdity.

01:02:38.154 --> 01:02:39.804
But God is l,ove and love is there.

01:02:39.804 --> 01:02:42.124
Ånd in his love everyone should do it.

01:02:42.124 --> 01:02:43.124
It has to happen.

01:02:43.124 --> 01:02:44.124
Any other questions?

01:02:44.124 --> 01:02:45.124
Question: (A woman asks where the other public
meeting will be).

01:02:45.124 --> 01:02:46.124
(Warren says he’ll make an announcement
later)

01:02:46.124 --> 01:02:47.124
Mother: You see, all of us have got it and
we’ll give all that to you and you’ll

01:02:47.124 --> 01:02:48.124
come along to those lectures and you will
help us to bring...

01:02:48.124 --> 01:02:49.953
(you see actually we do not know how to meet
the seekers.

01:02:49.953 --> 01:02:52.963
That’s the main point with us.

01:02:52.963 --> 01:02:56.344
And we don’t need anything else.

01:02:56.344 --> 01:02:57.973
Like the lady offered...lso.

01:02:57.973 --> 01:02:59.014
We don’t need it.

01:02:59.014 --> 01:03:00.324
We don’t need any money.

01:03:00.324 --> 01:03:01.324
We have everything.

01:03:01.324 --> 01:03:02.324
We have no problem.

01:03:02.324 --> 01:03:03.324
And no money...othing.

01:03:03.324 --> 01:03:07.304
We have got places to live in and we have
no problem of any kind.

01:03:07.304 --> 01:03:09.193
What we want...e have also got halls and everything
and we don’t need anything.

01:03:09.193 --> 01:03:11.108
But what we want...hat we want...eekers to
come down and you have to suggest how to get

01:03:11.108 --> 01:03:12.314
them; that’s all.

01:03:12.314 --> 01:03:13.524
(Announcements of meetings)

01:03:13.524 --> 01:03:14.524
Question:...

01:03:14.524 --> 01:03:19.674
lady asks for Mother’s comment on somebody
but asks Her not to judge.)

01:03:19.674 --> 01:03:21.154
Mother: No,...ave to.

01:03:21.154 --> 01:03:22.644
I’m sorry,...ave to.

01:03:22.644 --> 01:03:26.854
You see, it’s very good of you to say that...hould
not make comment(word?).

01:03:26.854 --> 01:03:27.854
But...ave to.

01:03:27.854 --> 01:03:28.854
I’m sorry.

01:03:28.854 --> 01:03:29.914
Because you see,...an’t bear to see the
way their kundalini’s have gone down.

01:03:29.914 --> 01:03:33.014
The connection has to be.

01:03:33.014 --> 01:03:37.364
You see, when Christ was criticizing them,
they said the same thing to him.

01:03:37.364 --> 01:03:41.364
“Why should you criticize them?

01:03:41.364 --> 01:03:43.624
They don’t critisize you?”

01:03:43.624 --> 01:03:54.534
So He said, “The Satanic are not going to
speak against the Satanic."

01:03:54.534 --> 01:03:55.664
That’s what it is.

01:03:55.664 --> 01:04:02.074
You do not know how serious it is.

01:04:02.074 --> 01:04:15.414
When you will know, you will be amazed.

01:04:15.414 --> 01:04:25.243
You do not know how serious it is and that’s
shy you are saying that.

01:04:25.243 --> 01:04:28.183
Once you find out shy...m saying this.

01:04:28.183 --> 01:04:33.084
You see, it is not easy to say anything against
these people.

01:04:33.084 --> 01:04:34.174
It’s not easy.

01:04:34.174 --> 01:04:37.933
Bust none of them...

01:04:37.933 --> 01:04:54.664
have said about them...ach one of them about
l0 years back...penly...bout each one of them...ho

01:04:54.664 --> 01:04:57.054
they are.

01:04:57.054 --> 01:05:07.864
Nobody has even tried to even bring any suit
or any law suit against me.

01:05:07.864 --> 01:05:11.094
And whatever is wrong,...ave to say that.

01:05:11.094 --> 01:05:12.634
I’m sorry, my child.

01:05:12.634 --> 01:05:16.214
You see, this is not...hing where you can
allow Satanic things to happen.

01:05:16.214 --> 01:05:17.214
We have to discriminate.

01:05:17.214 --> 01:05:18.214
You will know yourself.

01:05:18.214 --> 01:05:19.214
You cannot love...nake like that.

01:05:19.214 --> 01:05:20.874
You must know...nake is...nake and...uman
being is...uman being.

01:05:20.874 --> 01:05:21.874
Everybody has his own values.

01:05:21.874 --> 01:05:24.154
You see,...m not here going to be angry with
you for that.

01:05:24.154 --> 01:05:27.154
But...m angry with them!...ith all of them...efinitely.

01:05:27.154 --> 01:05:29.854
You do not...ou just wait and see.

01:05:29.854 --> 01:05:33.003
You yourself will be so angry.

01:05:33.003 --> 01:05:34.584
I’ll show you.

01:05:34.584 --> 01:05:38.264
Say,...irl who came from one of them...hugs.

01:05:38.264 --> 01:05:39.834
She was epileptic.

01:05:39.834 --> 01:05:41.934
Her daughter was epileptic.

01:05:41.934 --> 01:05:44.044
Her husband was epileptic.

01:05:44.044 --> 01:05:45.614
She was...randdaughter of...uke.

01:05:45.614 --> 01:05:48.764
She had lost all her money.

01:05:48.764 --> 01:05:51.394
They had sold their house.

01:05:51.394 --> 01:05:54.024
They were on the streets.

01:05:54.024 --> 01:05:55.024
Absolutely.

01:05:55.024 --> 01:05:56.134
And she is...eeker!

01:05:56.134 --> 01:05:58.944
If you are...ohter, what would you say to
that?

01:05:58.944 --> 01:06:01.253
You will say they are very nice people?

01:06:01.253 --> 01:06:02.354
You will go and garland them?

01:06:02.354 --> 01:06:03.354
Not one, but I’ll show you thousands of
them.

01:06:03.354 --> 01:06:05.804
Here we have cases who have come.

01:06:05.804 --> 01:06:07.184
She is Hesta...itting here.

01:06:07.184 --> 01:06:08.184
You just ask her.

01:06:08.184 --> 01:06:09.184
How much she was harmed!

01:06:09.184 --> 01:06:10.184
How she was harmed.

01:06:10.184 --> 01:06:11.184
She would have been dead!

01:06:11.184 --> 01:06:12.184
Do you think...hould say they are nice people?

01:06:12.184 --> 01:06:13.184
Apart from anything else, they spoil your
chances of realization.

01:06:13.184 --> 01:06:14.184
I am not here for votes or anything.

01:06:14.184 --> 01:06:15.184
Why should...ry to please them?...ave to tell
the truth, if you don’t mind....ave to tell.

01:06:15.184 --> 01:06:16.184
Question: Oh, then...ould just like to ask,
what about people that are doing chakra therapy

01:06:16.184 --> 01:06:17.184
and they charge very high prices?

01:06:17.184 --> 01:06:22.554
Maybe they are not high prices and they help
people and yet people don’t have that kind

01:06:22.554 --> 01:06:29.274
of money....ould like to ask you, what do
you think about people who do chakra therapy

01:06:29.274 --> 01:06:30.274
and charge fees?

01:06:30.274 --> 01:06:31.274
Mother:...on’t know what sort of...

01:06:31.274 --> 01:06:32.274
(word?)

01:06:32.274 --> 01:06:33.274
make believes.

01:06:33.274 --> 01:06:34.274
How can you have any kind of chakra thearpy
without realization?

01:06:34.274 --> 01:06:35.274
It’s all make believe.

01:06:35.274 --> 01:06:36.274
You blieve all this nonsensical people.

01:06:36.274 --> 01:06:37.274
What am...o do now?

01:06:37.274 --> 01:06:38.274
Why do you believe them?

01:06:38.274 --> 01:06:39.274
You see chakra therapy,...ean...on’t know...n
ordinary Indian can understand.

01:06:39.274 --> 01:06:40.274
Only...aint can do it.

01:06:40.274 --> 01:06:41.274
He has to be...aint.

01:06:41.274 --> 01:06:42.274
How can he charge money?...aint will not take...ie
from you.

01:06:42.274 --> 01:06:43.274
It is...imple thing, try to understand that.

01:06:43.274 --> 01:06:44.274
Question: Well,...lways thought that, but
this is America.

01:06:44.274 --> 01:06:45.274
Chakra therapy is...ew thing, I’ve heard...laugh)
(woman keeps telling her story)

01:06:45.274 --> 01:06:46.274
Mother:...ell you that.

01:06:46.274 --> 01:06:47.274
What is it.

01:06:47.274 --> 01:06:48.274
You might get...emporary help.

01:06:48.274 --> 01:06:49.274
No doubt about it.

01:06:49.274 --> 01:06:50.274
You can get...emporary help.

01:06:50.274 --> 01:06:51.274
You see, now you are bringing into controversies
so...ave to tell you about it.

01:06:51.274 --> 01:06:52.274
But you don’t mind it.

01:06:52.274 --> 01:06:53.274
What heppens within us, we have some stored
energies in the chakras, alright?

01:06:53.274 --> 01:06:54.274
And, like acupuncture, is also...s not to
be done by someone who is not...ealized soul.

01:06:54.274 --> 01:06:55.274
Is to be done only by realized souls.

01:06:55.274 --> 01:06:56.274
If acupuncture is done by someone who is not...ealized
soul...

01:06:56.274 --> 01:06:57.274
mean it’s against Zen (?).

01:06:57.274 --> 01:06:58.274
It’s against.

01:06:58.274 --> 01:06:59.274
You have to be...word ?),...ean people don’t
read about it....usha (word ?) means...ealized

01:06:59.274 --> 01:07:00.274
soul.

01:07:00.274 --> 01:07:01.274
If you are not...ealized soul, you are not
supposed to do it.

01:07:01.274 --> 01:07:02.274
Now, this one also...hakra therapy...hat you
can do is to work on the sympathetic nervous

01:07:02.274 --> 01:07:03.274
system.

01:07:03.274 --> 01:07:04.274
Now the sympathetic nervous system, you can
pull out the little energy that you have,

01:07:04.274 --> 01:07:05.274
but you develop other problems with it.

01:07:05.274 --> 01:07:06.274
Sahaja Yoga is...hing by which you get open
to the all pervading power....ll the time

01:07:06.274 --> 01:07:07.274
flowing within us.

01:07:07.274 --> 01:07:31.443
You have to open yourslf to that universal
being within your heart...hich is the spirit.

01:07:31.443 --> 01:07:33.074
You don’t have to sort of lessen energy
here and energy there and energy there.

01:07:33.074 --> 01:07:34.074
You don’t have to take that energy out.

01:07:34.074 --> 01:07:35.074
But the energy from the above comes in.

01:07:35.074 --> 01:07:36.074
Like grace, it flows.

01:07:36.074 --> 01:07:37.074
And that’s how always such things can lead
into terrible problems...ental problems....

01:07:37.074 --> 01:07:38.074
all kinds of things.

01:07:38.074 --> 01:07:39.074
Supposing you try to treat somebody mentally....

01:07:39.074 --> 01:07:40.074
then you extract the physical energy.

01:07:40.074 --> 01:07:41.074
Then the person will suffer physically.

01:07:41.074 --> 01:07:42.074
You see, this

01:07:42.074 --> 01:07:43.074
stored energy for...articular chakra, which...ill
explain to you...verything...ll right?

01:07:43.074 --> 01:07:44.074
And you cannot charge for raising your kundalini
because you have your kundalini intact there.

01:07:44.074 --> 01:07:45.074
You are just there.

01:07:45.074 --> 01:07:46.074
You have everything.

01:07:46.074 --> 01:07:47.074
Only thing, by my being here, your kundalini
rises by itself.

01:07:47.074 --> 01:07:48.074
So you cannot pay.

01:07:48.074 --> 01:07:49.074
Do you pay the Mother Earth for sprouting...eed?

01:07:49.074 --> 01:07:50.074
They do help temporarily.

01:07:50.074 --> 01:07:51.074
They do.

01:07:51.074 --> 01:07:52.074
For example, somebody gives you...antra.

01:07:52.074 --> 01:07:53.074
Alright, take...antra...’ll tell you...ay
they say Rama Sita.

01:07:53.074 --> 01:07:54.074
Now, there cannot be only one mantra belonging
to any one in any science of mantras.

01:07:54.074 --> 01:07:55.074
Because you people are so naive...ou see...hey
say “all right, you take the name of Rama."

01:07:55.074 --> 01:07:56.074
This cannot be done.

01:07:56.074 --> 01:07:57.074
Rama mantra is only on the right heart chakra.

01:07:57.074 --> 01:07:58.074
If you have...roblem, has to be given by...ealized
soul because it has to be...onnected one.

01:07:58.074 --> 01:07:59.074
It is...cience, you know.

01:07:59.074 --> 01:08:00.074
All of them know what mantra is to be said
at what point because they know how to raise

01:08:00.074 --> 01:08:01.074
the kundalini....

01:08:01.074 --> 01:08:02.074
they know where it is obstructed and what
mantra is to be said and which Deity is to

01:08:02.074 --> 01:08:03.074
be awakened.

01:08:03.074 --> 01:08:05.324
Notice the mantra for which particular mantra
(word?)...hey know all that and they know

01:08:05.324 --> 01:08:06.324
all the methods.

01:08:06.324 --> 01:08:07.324
But why they may give you...antra?

01:08:07.324 --> 01:08:08.324
Now, you may feel better...eally, sometimes
you may feel dynamic.

01:08:08.324 --> 01:08:09.324
You feel, “Oh,...m very activated; maybe...m
over active."

01:08:09.324 --> 01:08:10.324
And...pirit (if that name may be allowed)
may come around...nd you may become possessed...nd

01:08:10.324 --> 01:08:11.324
you might become extremely active.

01:08:11.324 --> 01:08:12.324
But, then you’ll go down.

01:08:12.324 --> 01:08:13.324
Within five years, there will be...omplete
decline.

01:08:13.324 --> 01:08:14.324
You’ll be...ecluse.

01:08:14.324 --> 01:08:15.324
You’ll be...rightened person.

01:08:15.324 --> 01:08:16.324
You’ll be...oward.

01:08:16.324 --> 01:08:17.324
You won’t be able to even...here are people
I’ve known who can not even face (what do

01:08:17.324 --> 01:08:18.324
you call that...arlic.

01:08:18.324 --> 01:08:19.324
Can you imagine...fraid of...egetable?

01:08:19.324 --> 01:08:20.324
It’s really...here are people, if you snow
then garlic, they are frightened....ean, are

01:08:20.324 --> 01:08:21.324
you going to become like that?

01:08:21.324 --> 01:08:22.324
Is that freedom?

01:08:22.324 --> 01:08:23.324
Question: (A man had treid raising his kundalini
and was asking about seeing something (?) in

01:08:23.324 --> 01:08:24.324
his head and other places).

01:08:24.324 --> 01:08:25.324
Mother: You see, if you try your own self,
you see trying with the kundalini...ctually

01:08:25.324 --> 01:08:26.324
the sympathetic goes into activity.

01:08:26.324 --> 01:08:27.324
You have no right on the parasympathetic.

01:08:27.324 --> 01:08:28.324
Parasympathetic is the one which balances
and that is the central path of Sushumna through

01:08:28.324 --> 01:08:29.324
which the kundalini has to rise.

01:08:29.324 --> 01:08:30.324
But if you try anything, what you do is...lways
you can use sympathetic.

01:08:30.324 --> 01:08:31.324
I’ll give you an example.

01:08:31.324 --> 01:08:32.324
Supposing you are running fast.

01:08:32.324 --> 01:08:33.324
Alright, then you can raise the rate of your
heart.

01:08:33.324 --> 01:08:34.324
But you cannot slow it down.

01:08:34.324 --> 01:08:35.324
It slows down

01:08:35.324 --> 01:08:36.324
by itself.

01:08:36.324 --> 01:08:37.324
That is parasympathetic activity.

01:08:37.324 --> 01:08:38.324
So you just get into sympathetic activity
and sympathetic activity, if you overdo it,

01:08:38.324 --> 01:08:39.324
then all these symptoms happen and it’s
not healthful.

01:08:39.324 --> 01:08:40.324
On the contrary, chakras go into...

01:08:40.324 --> 01:08:41.324
.(quite like this is the left and the right
sympathetic and these are the centers).

01:08:41.324 --> 01:08:42.324
They get pulled down like that and if they
are pulled like this, then you are harmed.

01:08:42.324 --> 01:08:43.324
So is not an experience of kundalini; is of
the sympathetic.

01:08:43.324 --> 01:08:44.324
Question: “....his wasn’t anything...as
looking for or asking for, (etc.)but how come

01:08:44.324 --> 01:08:45.324
it went down, instead of coming up?”

01:08:45.324 --> 01:08:46.324
Mother: No, it doesn’t go down.

01:08:46.324 --> 01:08:47.324
Kundalini never goes down.

01:08:47.324 --> 01:08:48.324
It goes upward...lways.

01:08:48.324 --> 01:08:49.324
The thing that comes down is the grace, you
see.

01:08:49.324 --> 01:08:50.324
The grace comes down, not the Kundalini.

01:08:50.324 --> 01:08:51.324
Kundalini always goes upwards.

01:08:51.324 --> 01:08:52.324
And the grace comes on your sympathetic which
cools you down completely.

01:08:52.324 --> 01:08:53.324
You become absolutely relaxed with the grace.

01:08:53.324 --> 01:08:54.324
But the kundalini itself always goes up.

01:08:54.324 --> 01:08:55.324
It never comes down.

01:08:55.324 --> 01:08:56.324
But, in people, it so happens that kundalini
goes through this central path.

01:08:56.324 --> 01:08:57.324
Now, if it is...ort of...ery much rugged or
if it is extremely smooth due to the mistakes

01:08:57.324 --> 01:08:58.324
of the seekers, then it falls down.

01:08:58.324 --> 01:08:59.324
It falls down...t falls down is...ifferent
point then going like that.

01:08:59.324 --> 01:09:00.324
It falls down.

01:09:00.324 --> 01:09:01.324
Then you have to raise it again and tie it
up.

01:09:01.324 --> 01:09:02.324
Again, raise it and tie it up.

01:09:02.324 --> 01:09:03.324
In many people, it has to be done but it can
work out.

01:09:03.324 --> 01:09:04.324
You will get the complete knowledge, don’t
you worry.

01:09:04.324 --> 01:09:05.324
Now, he has been in eighteen months, but he
is...aster of kundalini.

01:09:05.324 --> 01:09:06.324
He can raise your kundalini and you are just
like him.

01:09:06.324 --> 01:09:07.324
You would become the same.

01:09:07.324 --> 01:09:08.324
There’s no problem at all.

01:09:08.324 --> 01:09:09.324
It will work out.

01:09:09.324 --> 01:09:10.324
Question:...ow did you get your realization?”

01:09:10.324 --> 01:09:11.324
Mother:...as born like that.

01:09:11.324 --> 01:09:12.324
I’m like this for ages....

01:09:12.324 --> 01:09:13.324
ancient....m...ystery...

01:09:13.324 --> 01:09:14.324
should say at the beginning.
