00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.375
Shri Ganesha Puja, Cabella Ligure,
22 September 2001

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.490
Today we have assembled here

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.830
to worship Shri Ganesha.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.870
Shri Ganesha who is the Lord of Innocence.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:20.620
He is the ocean of innocence.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.660
And though’ he is

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.990
such a young, little boy,

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:39.580
he can fight the whole world,

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:48.740
he can destroy all the negativity.

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.990
That’s the sign of innocence.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:01.950
There have been stories

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.990
that children who have fallen from a very great height

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.990
were completely saved, nothing happened to them.

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:20.830
Their innocence is such a powerful thing

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.830
that it doesn’t harm anyone

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.450
who is not to be harmed.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.290
It has all the wisdom of the world,

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.870
all the understanding of the world;

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:49.490
and anybody who tries to harm the innocence,

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.370
the world, the whole world –

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:01.370
which may not have cared so much for innocence,

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.490
might not have worshiped innocence so much –

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.830
but they all stand, stand up against

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:16.490
anybody who tries to harm the innocence.

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.700
You can see in your own lives

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:30.700
around you,  anybody tries to trouble children –

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.620
all of the them, whatever they are,

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.490
whatever they are coming from,

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.700
whatever maybe their nationality,

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.620
they all jump, all jump to control

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.830
and to safeguard that child.

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.370
What is it?

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.950
What is it within us that makes us so very conscious

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.540
to protect the innocence?

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:12.450
It’s really a shame,

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.370
a great shame for us,

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:21.450
when we find in this world that innocence is under attack.

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:28.950
Anything else can be tolerated.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:33.990
Innocent people who have done nothing wrong,

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:40.700
those who have no malice,

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:49.410
who are living like little children, I should say,

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.700
if they are attacked by anyone –

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:01.990
not that the whole world reacts to that –

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:11.580
but everyone of them cannot bear

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:18.790
any innocent person or ‘innocent being’ being harmed.

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:24.990
We don’t realise that within us

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:32.700
there is the ocean of love

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:39.580
and ocean of understanding for children.

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:42.790
Why? Why should it be?

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:48.410
Why should we feel like that, especially for children?

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:52.990
Especially for innocence?

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:59.490
There are people who are always attacking innocent people,

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:02.950
innocent children, there are.

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:08.660
But no-one wants to support them.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:16.660
No-one thinks that it’s proper to ill-treat children.

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:22.830
And those who have done this have to suffer.

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:26.410
They all suffer as a reaction.

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:29.740
What is it within us

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:33.580
that creates that reaction, that tremendous reaction,

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:37.870
against innocence?

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:41.540
For example if there is a regular war,

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:44.540
and if there are people fighting;

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:50.410
in a regular war, they don’t have much sympathy.

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:54.660
In the world also, they say “Alright,

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:58.990
they are of that understanding, they are of that kind of a thing”.

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:05.700
The greatest sympathy comes when innocence is being challenged.

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:09.990
That’s what human beings have.

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:16.660
Within themselves they have the power, power of Shri Ganesha,

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:22.660
which gives you that feeling,

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:29.330
that capacity, that understanding

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:34.990
that you have to protect innocent,

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:40.620
innocent children, innocent people.

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:46.410
And the whole world can rise against all such people

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:49.740
who are trying to kill the innocent.

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:56.370
There cannot be any doubt.

00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:02.700
If they cannot oppose such an attack,

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:05.540
or criticise such a thing,

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:09.740
then they are not yet human beings, I would say.

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:19.990
The highest personality can sacrifice anything

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:24.450
and can give up anything,

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:29.410
but they cannot give up the feeling

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:32.290
they have for innocence.

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:37.620
It’s very remarkable. We don’t realise

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:44.370
how much there is this ocean of protection and love

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:46.870
for the innocent.

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:54.790
What attracts the greatest strength is when we see

00:10:55.740 --> 00:11:01.870
an innocent person, innocent children, are under attack.

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:06.950
That’s the beauty of human beings.

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:11.950
Of course there are many human beings who can be cruel,

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:16.410
who are, I would say, call them devils – maybe, maybe.

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:19.950
But when it comes to children,

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.830
and to innocent people,

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:30.450
everyone feels his responsibility.

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:37.830
It’s difficult for normal human beings to be innocent

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:46.950
because they have a kind of an understanding

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:52.870
that they are something great,

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:58.790
that they understand everything, that they can analyse everything,

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:03.370
and they could be crooks, they could be aggressive,

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:07.950
they could be troublesome, they could be anything –

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:12.370
and they can give explanation for that, doesn’t matter –

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:18.870
but still, on the whole, they can never be respected

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:23.660
and they can never be honoured

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:25.870
for the thing they are doing.

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:29.490
For us, the Sahaja Yogis,

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:34.660
the Sahaj culture is to respect your innocence.

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:37.660
You might feel a little bit cheated,

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:40.580
you might feel a little bit dominated,

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:44.490
you might feel a little bit disgraced,

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:48.910
but Sahaja Yogi have to be innocent.

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:52.910
Because with them lies the power of Shri Ganesha.

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:56.870
They should not feel dejected

00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:02.450
if they are being used, insulted,

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:06.740
tortured, dominated, it’s alright.

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:11.660
They should not try to destroy

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:16.700
the innocence of other people, of anyone.

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:22.450
Automatically it will work. You will be amazed

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:27.830
that when innocence is challenged,

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:34.660
all the goodness of the world comes to the rescue of that.

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:42.990
An example of this is the recent war, so-called war, of America.

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:48.450
Where innocent people – they had done nothing wrong

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:53.870
– have been tortured,have been killed.

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:59.910
At that time, all over the world,

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:04.830
it’s a big support for them.

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:12.410
Every country, whether it believes in those people or not,

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:17.870
is anxious to look after

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:22.740
those who have done this crime.

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:26.700
They may not be belonging to the same religion,

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:29.790
they may not be belonging to the same country,

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:33.950
they may not be belonging to the same crimes,

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:40.700
but at this moment, who does not take the side of the innocence

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:46.830
will be singled out and will be destroyed – no doubt about it.

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:51.490
Once and for all they will learn a lesson

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:55.330
that ‘you cannot attack innocent people’.

00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:59.290
I have told you, in Sahaja Yoga,

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:04.410
we should not ever be annoyed with out children.

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:09.370
We should not, in no way punish them.

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:15.950
Our main achievement

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:21.740
should be that loving attention for children.

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:26.790
All over the world, whether he belongs

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:30.620
to your family or to some other family,

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:33.370
or has some sort of

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:42.330
detached attention with you,

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:47.910
still because he’s a child, he’s innocent,

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:54.870
the innocence within itself, your own innocence,

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:56.990
will try to protect.

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:05.990
It’s very surprising how people take to sacrificing their lives

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:13.870
when it comes to the attack of innocence.

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:17.700
Children should never be attacked.

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:22.620
They have their own power to protect, no doubt.

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:27.410
But you shouldn’t waste your energy on something

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:32.700
that is extremely inauspicious,

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:39.790
extremely cruel and extremely ugly.

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:47.490
If you cannot love children, you cannot love anything.

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:52.950
I have not come across anyone so far who says

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:55.700
that they don’t love children – luckily!

00:16:56.540 --> 00:17:01.990
But maybe some might say “We love flowers”. Why?

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:06.700
Why do you love flowers? Because they are innocent.

00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:11.620
Because that beauty of innocence is within them.

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:13.870
You love nature – why?

00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:16.580
Because it is innocent.

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:22.790
But the greatest innocence is seen among human beings

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:26.870
who are Sahaja Yogis.

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:34.950
It is easy to be cunning, very easy to be cunning.

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:39.540
It’s very easy to be clever.

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:45.370
But to be wise, one should understand

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:48.580
the beauty of being innocent.

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:51.870
Possibly one may say “Mother,

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:54.910
one can get exploited if you are innocent”.

00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:59.660
No-one can exploit an innocent person.

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:02.450
They may believe that they have done this,

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:06.370
they have been very aggressive and all that, but they cannot.

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:10.950
It is like a rock.

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:17.790
It is like a rock that is not prevailed by

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:22.740
any ocean of anger

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:28.870
or any kind of revenge.

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:35.700
It’s the rock that is being looked after

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:39.830
and nourished by Shri Ganesha.

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:43.830
I’ve told you before also,

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:48.700
that the innocence within us never gets destroyed.

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:52.790
Very surprising. You may be a sinner,

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:57.990
you may be a very cruel person, you might be anything:

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:02.910
but it does not get,

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:05.740
it cannot get it.

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:12.490
After innocence.

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:19.740
It is a very, very secret thing that is put in us by the Divine.

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:26.830
We play with our innocence very much.

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:32.540
We think that by behaving any way we like,

00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:37.910
“It’s alright, after all it’s my own desire, my wish”.

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:44.620
And we’ll go on, we go on all the time

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:49.700
reducing our power, or we can say the hiding,

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:54.660
or covering our power of innocence.

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:59.410
And we think that we have done a great job,

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:06.580
that we have befooled all the people by our tricky nature.

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:12.660
This tricky nature cannot give you any satisfaction.

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:15.830
It is not self-sufficient.

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:22.290
When you try to trick someone, this trick works on you,

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:31.660
it is repelled on you, and destroys your faith in innocence –

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:34.910
which is the greatest faith,

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:38.700
the greatest help

00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:43.370
or [UNCLEAR} the greatest power on this earth.

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:48.490
Those people who do not respect their innocence

00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:51.950
because they think it makes you weak,

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:57.370
have not seen the power of innocence –

00:20:57.950 --> 00:21:00.620
how it works, how it acts.

00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:06.910
From all over the world, it reacts.

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:15.790
But, so far, I think the human beings are not conscious of the power

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:18.620
power of innocence.

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:22.540
But it is the highest thing to be innocent.

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:26.790
And it acts

00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:33.910
as if the whole understanding,

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:42.370
whole working-out of the be-ing

00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:46.620
is so beautifully achieved.

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:49.830
Now you see in this world

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:57.540
what says ,what people remember, what is respected.

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:04.620
It is respected the high ideals.

00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:13.620
But if you see to the subtle side of these high ideals of people

00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:21.540
have led a very, very beautiful life of very good character,

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:24.410
of very good nature’

00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:30.790
– all these people may have been harmed

00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:33.490
may have been killed –

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:37.620
but because of their innocence they shine,

00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:40.540
and shine through ages.

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:47.290
You can see the life of all great men like that;

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:53.450
they are all very simple,

00:22:55.330 --> 00:23:00.660
they are not deliberating anything –

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:08.700
spontaneous they are in their behaviour, spontaneously they live.

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:15.950
Nations after nations can be destroyed,

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:20.370
but the power of innocence cannot be destroyed.

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:22.370
Have faith in that.

00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:25.740
You have to have complete faith in yourself,

00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:29.910
and that ‘yourself’ is nothing but innocence.

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:35.370
You may say that ‘innocent people get cheated’.

00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:39.580
Nobody can cheat innocence,

00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:43.660
because that is something of very eternal value.

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:47.490
They might cheat you in money, might cheat you in something,

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:52.450
but the thing that is the most eternal is your innocence.

00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:56.410
And you will be the most successful person

00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:02.580
in life when you are absolutely innocent

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:05.580
and your are looking after your innocence.

00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:10.410
As I have told you, that innocence never gets destroyed.

00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:14.370
It can be covered by your ill thoughts,

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:18.490
by ill doing, it might be covered for the time being.

00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:21.740
But if you can take out the clouds

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:26.700
away from the sky of innocence,

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:30.450
the whole thing becomes so obvious

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:33.580
that you have won the whole world.

00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:38.410
We can take the case of Christ. He was crucified,

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:42.330
he was insulted, he was tortured.

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:45.490
Those who did this, where are they?

00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:50.580
Who knows them? Nobody even knows the name.

00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:53.410
Nobody is even bothered about them.

00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:57.620
A single one person was so much used

00:24:57.910 --> 00:24:59.740
and was so much tortured.

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:05.410
But despite that, what has happened?

00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:09.490
He has got the respect from the whole world.

00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:12.830
The whole world respects.

00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:19.330
Nobody says that ‘Look at that, how he was crucified,

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:21.950
what has he done …’ Nothing of the kind.

00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:28.580
They just respect. And what do they respect? The essence,

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:34.490
the essence of complete innocence.

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:44.370
They say in Sahaja Yoga that he was the incarnation of innocence.

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:51.410
He was the incarnation of Shri Ganesha – which can be verified.

00:25:52.990 --> 00:26:00.330
So, when we think that in our own ventures we can do what we like,

00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:04.490
and we don’t want to even remember that, we don’t want to even

00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:07.700
consider that it’s a wrong thing to do,

00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:13.740
we do not know what is ahead of us.

00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:16.370
What happened to Hitler also?

00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:20.490
He thought he can destroy the whole world,

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:24.290
he can manage to kill so many people

00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:29.370
and still he will remain a very great personality.

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:31.870
They are stupid not to understand

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:34.870
who are the people really respected.

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:40.910
Through ages, through history, no-one like Hitler.

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:44.330
He didn’t understand if you wanted to have

00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:46.950
really the power over the world,

00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:51.410
and he wanted to have the reputation of a great man,

00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:53.990
he should have followed the great people.

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:58.540
And the great people are those who are innocent.

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:04.580
Their main power is innocence; take any one of them.

00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:10.790
I don’t know how to say that this power acts,

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:13.540
because it acts in so many ways.

00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:19.910
You can pass through historical events, so many of them,

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:25.370
and what will you find? A person who is so innocent,

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:29.950
simple and wise

00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:37.370
is remembered all your life.

00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:41.950
I was a child, very small, when I was in school

00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:45.700
I used to go to the library

00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:51.740
and read about the lives of great men

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:57.830
who have created some great things for us.

00:27:58.490 --> 00:28:00.370
So many of them.

00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:03.410
And I was so impressed

00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:10.740
how some of them were so simple, so child-like.

00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:15.660
For example Abraham Lincoln

00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:20.870
for whom I have tremendous, tremendous respect,

00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:24.830
was a man tortured by his wife also.

00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:28.450
She said “You don’t know, you are very clumsy,

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:34.290
you don’t know how to dress up, you don’t know how to behave”.

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:43.990
And she actually was very harsh on him, all the time torturing him.

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:48.580
Ultimately he was also killed.

00:28:49.450 --> 00:28:53.990
So one can say, “You see, what’s the use of being Abraham Lincoln?

00:28:56.660 --> 00:29:01.870
Because he was killed, he was not successful.”

00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:06.580
Until today, all over the world,

00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:10.540
people know who was Abraham Lincoln.

00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:14.620
They don’t know his wife – maybe.

00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:24.290
But they knew who was Abraham Lincoln, everybody.

00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:29.950
Clumsy man, according to her,

00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:35.450
and all sorts of degradation for him.

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:42.290
But nobody respects her, nobody thinks anything about her.

00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:46.660
Who is respected today is Abraham Lincoln.

00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:54.410
Why? ‘Actually he was murdered, he was killed,

00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:58.660
that shows that he had no strength to survive’ –

00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:02.990
but he survived through ages!

00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:09.910
So many years have passed, still he’s surviving.

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:14.490
Take the case of all the great people

00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:18.290
who have been innocent;

00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:21.330
and that’s why they had ideals.

00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:25.580
To them their ideals were more important than anything else,

00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:29.620
even their lives. Everything was nothing.

00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:33.790
Now the sense of ideals and idealism

00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:36.410
comes only from your innocence.

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:41.620
That’s the one which teaches you what is your ideal;

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:44.790
how you should exist;

00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:48.990
what kind of a life you should lead.

00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:56.580
It is not important that you have big authorities,

00:30:56.790 --> 00:31:03.540
or you have a very big positions as ministers and all that.

00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:06.790
There have been so many who came and died.

00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:11.370
They had so many people with ambitions

00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:17.330
and so many people who were oppressive, but where are they?

00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:21.370
Nobody’s bothered about them, nobody wants to look at them.

00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:27.450
If their photograph appears people close their eyes

00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:29.450
‘No, no, we don’t want to see this man’.

00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:34.370
But if there’s a little boy, innocent child,

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:37.910
who is talking in a very innocent manner,

00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:41.410
the whole world admires that child.

00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:45.830
And these great men are, really,

00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:49.830
they are the symbols of that innocence.

00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:56.370
Their main quality was innocence, from where the wisdom has come.

00:31:57.330 --> 00:32:00.790
Ganesha’s main quality is his wisdom.

00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:06.830
He knew what was success, through his,

00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:11.740
I should say, innocent qualities.

00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:16.290
Sometimes the innocent people are not even aware of their

00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:18.700
quality of innocence.

00:32:19.790 --> 00:32:25.990
It’s very surprising how the quality of innocence

00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:30.490
shines through human beings who may be very ordinary,

00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:33.540
who may be very

00:32:39.910 --> 00:32:45.990
who may be very simple, who may not look so intelligent and sharp,

00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:49.990
who may not become good diplomats, what ever it is –

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:56.950
they are innocent! That’s were ends all the glory of human beings.

00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:59.580
To be innocent –

00:33:01.490 --> 00:33:02.620
What’s the matter?

00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:12.490
– so to be innocent, what do you do?

00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:18.540
People will say, “Mother, what do we do to be innocent?”

00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:27.540
Firstly, you can see for yourself

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:30.490
how your mind works.

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:38.410
What does it do? How it reacts.

00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:43.370
This is what one has to watch,

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:45.950
which I call as ‘introspection’.

00:33:47.910 --> 00:33:53.450
What sort of plans your mind takes to?

00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:59.950
What does it think is the best?

00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:03.660
In that thinking, thought process,

00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:12.290
what is the most important way to look at yourself?

00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:19.410
The first and the foremost is that

00:34:20.490 --> 00:34:23.330
you should know how you react to someone.

00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:31.370
Is it an innocent reaction? Or it is a vindictive reaction.

00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:35.990
It is very easy to see yourself,

00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:38.660
because now you are all Sahaja Yogi.

00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:43.870
You can see for yourself how is your reaction

00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:51.700
to any aggression on you, or any kind of a

00:34:53.740 --> 00:34:57.910
trouble coming on you. How do you react to that?

00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:01.450
What is your behaviour?

00:35:02.830 --> 00:35:07.910
If you are a very powerful person, then your behaviour is –

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:13.450
for that you are not bothered. You see for yourself its

00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:16.290
just a stupid thing people are doing to you.

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:18.740
Absolutely stupid.

00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:21.540
And when they are doing stupid things,

00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:24.580
why should we bother about them?

00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:27.700
Why should we waste our energy about them?

00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:35.620
It comes to a point where their stupidity is found out,

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:42.290
in such a manner that all their lives and afterwards

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:45.330
they are treated with contempt.

00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:47.990
People don’t even want to take their names,

00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:51.620
they don’t want to have their photographs,

00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:55.740
they don’t want to have anything to do with them.

00:35:57.330 --> 00:36:00.580
At this time, at such a juncture,

00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:05.700
what happens is the people who are crooks,

00:36:06.490 --> 00:36:13.490
who are not innocent, who are against innocence,

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:18.910
they start following them because it suits them better.

00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:23.910
It suits them to be aggressive, to be cunning

00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:27.660
and that’s how a new group is formed –

00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:30.910
which we can call ‘a satanic group’.

00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:35.990
And this satanic group also cannot do anything,

00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:40.330
anything whatsoever, to an innocent personality.

00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:42.990
There is a Sanskrit sloka like that –

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:48.410
Nainam chidanti sashtrani – for the Spirit,

00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:52.330
‘It cannot be killed by any weapon’.

00:36:53.410 --> 00:36:58.450
Nainam dahanti pavaka – ‘No fire can burn it’.

00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:03.580
Sayanam cleydayantaposh naso sathe maratha –

00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:09.490
Marutha is the air, or we can call it wind,

00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:12.330
‘Wind cannot also suck it’,

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:17.580
it is above all the nature, which is trying to destroy.

00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:23.450
But you will be amazed that nature understands.

00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:25.870
I told you, nature is innocent.

00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:30.580
It understands and it acts

00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:37.370
at the right moment, against the person who is aggressive,

00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:44.950
who is trying to malign

00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:48.330
or trouble an innocent person.

00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:56.620
In this way we should know that we have to worship our innocence.

00:37:57.450 --> 00:37:59.660
I know sometimes one feels

00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:02.330
that you are dominated because of that.

00:38:03.370 --> 00:38:08.870
Sometimes one feels sad that  ‘Why you are put to this kind

00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:11.410
of a treatment by others’.

00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:14.370
All kinds of things come to your mind.

00:38:14.830 --> 00:38:17.540
But if you worship your innocence,

00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:21.830
then you will be always a happy person,

00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:27.330
always a kind person, always be humble person.

00:38:28.290 --> 00:38:30.870
So, one has to be careful.

00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:32.990
You are your own destroyer!

00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:35.830
You are the one who kills, you see

00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:37.990
What do you say to it?

00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:40.990
Hitler destroyed himself; who has destroyed him?

00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:44.740
I mean in any way, everybody has to die so he would have been dead.

00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:48.740
But who has destroyed it forever is himself.

00:38:49.450 --> 00:38:52.330
So, you kill yourself –

00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:56.410
through this you can save yourself

00:38:56.830 --> 00:39:01.410
and become very glorified if you are innocent.

00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:04.620
Have faith in the power of innocence.

00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:11.410
What is important is, how you show in your own life

00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:16.990
the power of innocence, how you behave towards each other,

00:39:17.490 --> 00:39:20.990
and that is what is what, is what I call ‘the love’.

00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:25.450
You cannot be compassionate unless and until

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:28.580
you have this attitude towards yourself.

00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:32.580
You cannot be kind. Temporarily you might feel this,

00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:36.740
but a permanently compassionate temperament comes

00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:41.700
only through the permanent flowing of innocence

00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:43.450
through your character.

00:39:44.410 --> 00:39:46.950
It’s such a transparent thing in a human being

00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:52.950
and that it sustains, it overpowers all other things,

00:39:53.450 --> 00:40:00.410
leave alone the time – thousands of years people will not forget

00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:05.870
you the Sahaja Yogi, if you show your valour

00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:11.290
and your strength of your innocence.

00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:15.990
I’m sorry for today’s programme being so late,

00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:19.660
but you know I was ready to come

00:40:21.290 --> 00:40:26.830
but the marriages are becoming the main function now.

00:40:28.410 --> 00:40:30.450
Because it came so late,

00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:34.410
that till the last minute we were deciding about marriages.

00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:39.370
But I am telling you this is the last time. Next time we’ll stop it.

00:40:40.330 --> 00:40:45.580
You must send your applications

00:40:46.910 --> 00:40:52.290
at least eight days before, and for Ganapatipule it is two weeks.

00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:59.490
Otherwise – there are only twenty-four hours in a day,

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:02.870
and you cannot increase those!

00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:07.450
Now there is one humble request I have to make,

00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:12.330
that if you want to settle your marriage,

00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:18.990
then please do it in a way that I can have time to see.

00:41:19.830 --> 00:41:22.620
Otherwise I’ll leave it to others to decide.

00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:24.950
If you like, it can be done.

00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:29.450
So a simple thing is this to understand,

00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:32.290
that marriage is a very important thing.

00:41:33.330 --> 00:41:35.950
You can create innocent children if you are married.

00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:40.990
But if you behave in this manner, little, little responsible –

00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:47.990
so I have to request you to understand the value of time.

00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:54.290
Because from next time I can assure you we cannot have marriages

00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:58.790
if you send your applications so late.

00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:01.870
It should be within one week’s time,

00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:05.660
I hope you’ll understand that.

00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:07.290
Thank you very much.
