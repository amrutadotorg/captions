Shri Ganesha Puja, Cabella Ligure,
22 September 2001

02:47.830 --> 02:51.490
Today we have assembled here

02:53.700 --> 02:56.830
to worship Shri Ganesha.

03:01.410 --> 03:06.870
Shri Ganesha who is the Lord of Innocence.

03:13.790 --> 03:20.620
He is the ocean of innocence.

03:22.490 --> 03:24.660
And though’ he is

03:25.910 --> 03:31.990
such a young, little boy,

03:34.990 --> 03:39.580
he can fight the whole world,

03:42.740 --> 03:48.740
he can destroy all the negativity.

03:50.740 --> 03:54.990
That’s the sign of innocence.

04:00.290 --> 04:01.950
There have been stories

04:02.740 --> 04:05.990
that children who have fallen from a very great height

04:07.790 --> 04:10.990
were completely saved, nothing happened to them.

04:14.410 --> 04:20.830
Their innocence is such a powerful thing

04:23.700 --> 04:26.830
that it doesn’t harm anyone

04:28.660 --> 04:31.450
who is not to be harmed.

04:34.580 --> 04:37.290
It has all the wisdom of the world,

04:38.490 --> 04:40.870
all the understanding of the world;

04:42.580 --> 04:49.490
and anybody who tries to harm the innocence,

04:50.700 --> 04:54.370
the world, the whole world –

04:55.490 --> 05:01.370
which may not have cared so much for innocence,

05:01.830 --> 05:04.490
might not have worshiped innocence so much –

05:04.990 --> 05:09.830
but they all stand, stand up against

05:10.540 --> 05:16.490
anybody who tries to harm the innocence.

05:20.370 --> 05:24.700
You can see in your own lives

05:25.660 --> 05:30.700
around you,  anybody tries to trouble children –

05:31.950 --> 05:35.620
all of the them, whatever they are,

05:36.450 --> 05:38.490
whatever they are coming from,

05:38.990 --> 05:41.700
whatever maybe their nationality,

05:42.370 --> 05:46.620
they all jump, all jump to control

05:47.660 --> 05:49.830
and to safeguard that child.

05:51.830 --> 05:53.370
What is it?

05:54.740 --> 05:59.950
What is it within us that makes us so very conscious

06:01.870 --> 06:05.540
to protect the innocence?

06:07.910 --> 06:12.450
It’s really a shame,

06:12.990 --> 06:15.370
a great shame for us,

06:16.290 --> 06:21.450
when we find in this world that innocence is under attack.

06:23.660 --> 06:28.950
Anything else can be tolerated.

06:29.830 --> 06:33.990
Innocent people who have done nothing wrong,

06:34.990 --> 06:40.700
those who have no malice,

06:42.490 --> 06:49.410
who are living like little children, I should say,

06:51.330 --> 06:53.700
if they are attacked by anyone –

06:57.660 --> 07:01.990
not that the whole world reacts to that –

07:04.700 --> 07:11.580
but everyone of them cannot bear

07:13.410 --> 07:18.790
any innocent person or ‘innocent being’ being harmed.

07:21.290 --> 07:24.990
We don’t realise that within us

07:27.990 --> 07:32.700
there is the ocean of love

07:34.540 --> 07:39.580
and ocean of understanding for children.

07:40.790 --> 07:42.790
Why? Why should it be?

07:43.950 --> 07:48.410
Why should we feel like that, especially for children?

07:50.790 --> 07:52.990
Especially for innocence?

07:53.950 --> 07:59.490
There are people who are always attacking innocent people,

08:00.700 --> 08:02.950
innocent children, there are.

08:03.910 --> 08:08.660
But no-one wants to support them.

08:10.740 --> 08:16.660
No-one thinks that it’s proper to ill-treat children.

08:18.450 --> 08:22.830
And those who have done this have to suffer.

08:23.330 --> 08:26.410
They all suffer as a reaction.

08:27.660 --> 08:29.740
What is it within us

08:29.990 --> 08:33.580
that creates that reaction, that tremendous reaction,

08:34.620 --> 08:37.870
against innocence?

08:38.700 --> 08:41.540
For example if there is a regular war,

08:42.490 --> 08:44.540
and if there are people fighting;

08:45.330 --> 08:50.410
in a regular war, they don’t have much sympathy.

08:51.990 --> 08:54.660
In the world also, they say “Alright,

08:55.330 --> 08:58.990
they are of that understanding, they are of that kind of a thing”.

08:59.620 --> 09:05.700
The greatest sympathy comes when innocence is being challenged.

09:07.830 --> 09:09.990
That’s what human beings have.

09:10.740 --> 09:16.660
Within themselves they have the power, power of Shri Ganesha,

09:18.580 --> 09:22.660
which gives you that feeling,

09:24.370 --> 09:29.330
that capacity, that understanding

09:30.620 --> 09:34.990
that you have to protect innocent,

09:35.990 --> 09:40.620
innocent children, innocent people.

09:41.450 --> 09:46.410
And the whole world can rise against all such people

09:46.660 --> 09:49.740
who are trying to kill the innocent.

09:50.950 --> 09:56.370
There cannot be any doubt.

09:57.490 --> 10:02.700
If they cannot oppose such an attack,

10:03.370 --> 10:05.540
or criticise such a thing,

10:05.950 --> 10:09.740
then they are not yet human beings, I would say.

10:12.490 --> 10:19.990
The highest personality can sacrifice anything

10:22.450 --> 10:24.450
and can give up anything,

10:25.660 --> 10:29.410
but they cannot give up the feeling

10:29.990 --> 10:32.290
they have for innocence.

10:33.830 --> 10:37.620
It’s very remarkable. We don’t realise

10:38.370 --> 10:44.370
how much there is this ocean of protection and love

10:44.910 --> 10:46.870
for the innocent.

10:50.740 --> 10:54.790
What attracts the greatest strength is when we see

10:55.740 --> 11:01.870
an innocent person, innocent children, are under attack.

11:03.990 --> 11:06.950
That’s the beauty of human beings.

11:07.830 --> 11:11.950
Of course there are many human beings who can be cruel,

11:12.490 --> 11:16.410
who are, I would say, call them devils – maybe, maybe.

11:16.950 --> 11:19.950
But when it comes to children,

11:21.700 --> 11:23.830
and to innocent people,

11:24.950 --> 11:30.450
everyone feels his responsibility.

11:33.950 --> 11:37.830
It’s difficult for normal human beings to be innocent

11:39.290 --> 11:46.950
because they have a kind of an understanding

11:49.580 --> 11:52.870
that they are something great,

11:53.790 --> 11:58.790
that they understand everything, that they can analyse everything,

11:59.540 --> 12:03.370
and they could be crooks, they could be aggressive,

12:03.740 --> 12:07.950
they could be troublesome, they could be anything –

12:09.370 --> 12:12.370
and they can give explanation for that, doesn’t matter –

12:12.790 --> 12:18.870
but still, on the whole, they can never be respected

12:19.790 --> 12:23.660
and they can never be honoured

12:24.410 --> 12:25.870
for the thing they are doing.

12:26.790 --> 12:29.490
For us, the Sahaja Yogis,

12:29.830 --> 12:34.660
the Sahaj culture is to respect your innocence.

12:35.540 --> 12:37.660
You might feel a little bit cheated,

12:37.950 --> 12:40.580
you might feel a little bit dominated,

12:41.870 --> 12:44.490
you might feel a little bit disgraced,

12:44.740 --> 12:48.910
but Sahaja Yogi have to be innocent.

12:49.740 --> 12:52.910
Because with them lies the power of Shri Ganesha.

12:54.580 --> 12:56.870
They should not feel dejected

12:57.870 --> 13:02.450
if they are being used, insulted,

13:02.830 --> 13:06.740
tortured, dominated, it’s alright.

13:08.870 --> 13:11.660
They should not try to destroy

13:11.910 --> 13:16.700
the innocence of other people, of anyone.

13:18.330 --> 13:22.450
Automatically it will work. You will be amazed

13:22.910 --> 13:27.830
that when innocence is challenged,

13:29.540 --> 13:34.660
all the goodness of the world comes to the rescue of that.

13:36.370 --> 13:42.990
An example of this is the recent war, so-called war, of America.

13:43.830 --> 13:48.450
Where innocent people – they had done nothing wrong

13:49.290 --> 13:53.870
– have been tortured,have been killed.

13:54.870 --> 13:59.910
At that time, all over the world,

14:01.370 --> 14:04.830
it’s a big support for them.

14:06.330 --> 14:12.410
Every country, whether it believes in those people or not,

14:13.330 --> 14:17.870
is anxious to look after

14:18.910 --> 14:22.740
those who have done this crime.

14:23.660 --> 14:26.700
They may not be belonging to the same religion,

14:26.990 --> 14:29.790
they may not be belonging to the same country,

14:30.540 --> 14:33.950
they may not be belonging to the same crimes,

14:34.740 --> 14:40.700
but at this moment, who does not take the side of the innocence

14:41.540 --> 14:46.830
will be singled out and will be destroyed – no doubt about it.

14:48.330 --> 14:51.490
Once and for all they will learn a lesson

14:51.700 --> 14:55.330
that ‘you cannot attack innocent people’.

14:56.910 --> 14:59.290
I have told you, in Sahaja Yoga,

14:59.700 --> 15:04.410
we should not ever be annoyed with out children.

15:05.740 --> 15:09.370
We should not, in no way punish them.

15:11.290 --> 15:15.950
Our main achievement

15:16.740 --> 15:21.740
should be that loving attention for children.

15:22.490 --> 15:26.790
All over the world, whether he belongs

15:26.990 --> 15:30.620
to your family or to some other family,

15:30.910 --> 15:33.370
or has some sort of

15:37.990 --> 15:42.330
detached attention with you,

15:43.370 --> 15:47.910
still because he’s a child, he’s innocent,

15:48.950 --> 15:54.870
the innocence within itself, your own innocence,

15:55.450 --> 15:56.990
will try to protect.

15:59.330 --> 16:05.990
It’s very surprising how people take to sacrificing their lives

16:06.790 --> 16:13.870
when it comes to the attack of innocence.

16:14.950 --> 16:17.700
Children should never be attacked.

16:19.660 --> 16:22.620
They have their own power to protect, no doubt.

16:23.490 --> 16:27.410
But you shouldn’t waste your energy on something

16:27.580 --> 16:32.700
that is extremely inauspicious,

16:33.540 --> 16:39.790
extremely cruel and extremely ugly.

16:42.740 --> 16:47.490
If you cannot love children, you cannot love anything.

16:48.540 --> 16:52.950
I have not come across anyone so far who says

16:53.450 --> 16:55.700
that they don’t love children – luckily!

16:56.540 --> 17:01.990
But maybe some might say “We love flowers”. Why?

17:02.660 --> 17:06.700
Why do you love flowers? Because they are innocent.

17:07.870 --> 17:11.620
Because that beauty of innocence is within them.

17:11.990 --> 17:13.870
You love nature – why?

17:14.330 --> 17:16.580
Because it is innocent.

17:16.990 --> 17:22.790
But the greatest innocence is seen among human beings

17:23.410 --> 17:26.870
who are Sahaja Yogis.

17:31.490 --> 17:34.950
It is easy to be cunning, very easy to be cunning.

17:35.620 --> 17:39.540
It’s very easy to be clever.

17:41.620 --> 17:45.370
But to be wise, one should understand

17:45.910 --> 17:48.580
the beauty of being innocent.

17:49.540 --> 17:51.870
Possibly one may say “Mother,

17:51.990 --> 17:54.910
one can get exploited if you are innocent”.

17:55.910 --> 17:59.660
No-one can exploit an innocent person.

18:00.540 --> 18:02.450
They may believe that they have done this,

18:02.580 --> 18:06.370
they have been very aggressive and all that, but they cannot.

18:07.740 --> 18:10.950
It is like a rock.

18:12.330 --> 18:17.790
It is like a rock that is not prevailed by

18:17.990 --> 18:22.740
any ocean of anger

18:23.700 --> 18:28.870
or any kind of revenge.

18:30.830 --> 18:35.700
It’s the rock that is being looked after

18:36.540 --> 18:39.830
and nourished by Shri Ganesha.

18:41.620 --> 18:43.830
I’ve told you before also,

18:44.330 --> 18:48.700
that the innocence within us never gets destroyed.

18:49.580 --> 18:52.790
Very surprising. You may be a sinner,

18:54.410 --> 18:57.990
you may be a very cruel person, you might be anything:

18:59.330 --> 19:02.910
but it does not get,

19:03.660 --> 19:05.740
it cannot get it.

19:09.540 --> 19:12.490
After innocence.

19:13.660 --> 19:19.740
It is a very, very secret thing that is put in us by the Divine.

19:22.290 --> 19:26.830
We play with our innocence very much.

19:27.830 --> 19:32.540
We think that by behaving any way we like,

19:33.370 --> 19:37.910
“It’s alright, after all it’s my own desire, my wish”.

19:38.950 --> 19:44.620
And we’ll go on, we go on all the time

19:45.700 --> 19:49.700
reducing our power, or we can say the hiding,

19:50.330 --> 19:54.660
or covering our power of innocence.

19:55.540 --> 19:59.410
And we think that we have done a great job,

20:00.330 --> 20:06.580
that we have befooled all the people by our tricky nature.

20:08.410 --> 20:12.660
This tricky nature cannot give you any satisfaction.

20:13.700 --> 20:15.830
It is not self-sufficient.

20:16.790 --> 20:22.290
When you try to trick someone, this trick works on you,

20:23.830 --> 20:31.660
it is repelled on you, and destroys your faith in innocence –

20:32.620 --> 20:34.910
which is the greatest faith,

20:35.910 --> 20:38.700
the greatest help

20:38.990 --> 20:43.370
or [UNCLEAR} the greatest power on this earth.

20:43.740 --> 20:48.490
Those people who do not respect their innocence

20:48.990 --> 20:51.950
because they think it makes you weak,

20:54.330 --> 20:57.370
have not seen the power of innocence –

20:57.950 --> 21:00.620
how it works, how it acts.

21:01.290 --> 21:06.910
From all over the world, it reacts.

21:08.790 --> 21:15.790
But, so far, I think the human beings are not conscious of the power

21:16.580 --> 21:18.620
power of innocence.

21:18.950 --> 21:22.540
But it is the highest thing to be innocent.

21:23.870 --> 21:26.790
And it acts

21:28.990 --> 21:33.910
as if the whole understanding,

21:36.580 --> 21:42.370
whole working-out of the be-ing

21:43.790 --> 21:46.620
is so beautifully achieved.

21:47.540 --> 21:49.830
Now you see in this world

21:51.540 --> 21:57.540
what says ,what people remember, what is respected.

21:59.790 --> 22:04.620
It is respected the high ideals.

22:05.990 --> 22:13.620
But if you see to the subtle side of these high ideals of people

22:13.910 --> 22:21.540
have led a very, very beautiful life of very good character,

22:21.990 --> 22:24.410
of very good nature’

22:25.370 --> 22:30.790
– all these people may have been harmed

22:31.410 --> 22:33.490
may have been killed –

22:33.740 --> 22:37.620
but because of their innocence they shine,

22:37.870 --> 22:40.540
and shine through ages.

22:41.740 --> 22:47.290
You can see the life of all great men like that;

22:47.830 --> 22:53.450
they are all very simple,

22:55.330 --> 23:00.660
they are not deliberating anything –

23:01.790 --> 23:08.700
spontaneous they are in their behaviour, spontaneously they live.

23:10.830 --> 23:15.950
Nations after nations can be destroyed,

23:16.580 --> 23:20.370
but the power of innocence cannot be destroyed.

23:20.620 --> 23:22.370
Have faith in that.

23:22.910 --> 23:25.740
You have to have complete faith in yourself,

23:26.410 --> 23:29.910
and that ‘yourself’ is nothing but innocence.

23:31.410 --> 23:35.370
You may say that ‘innocent people get cheated’.

23:37.450 --> 23:39.580
Nobody can cheat innocence,

23:39.790 --> 23:43.660
because that is something of very eternal value.

23:44.540 --> 23:47.490
They might cheat you in money, might cheat you in something,

23:47.830 --> 23:52.450
but the thing that is the most eternal is your innocence.

23:53.410 --> 23:56.410
And you will be the most successful person

23:57.660 --> 24:02.580
in life when you are absolutely innocent

24:02.830 --> 24:05.580
and your are looking after your innocence.

24:06.370 --> 24:10.410
As I have told you, that innocence never gets destroyed.

24:10.660 --> 24:14.370
It can be covered by your ill thoughts,

24:14.580 --> 24:18.490
by ill doing, it might be covered for the time being.

24:18.740 --> 24:21.740
But if you can take out the clouds

24:22.410 --> 24:26.700
away from the sky of innocence,

24:26.990 --> 24:30.450
the whole thing becomes so obvious

24:30.660 --> 24:33.580
that you have won the whole world.

24:34.450 --> 24:38.410
We can take the case of Christ. He was crucified,

24:38.790 --> 24:42.330
he was insulted, he was tortured.

24:42.950 --> 24:45.490
Those who did this, where are they?

24:46.660 --> 24:50.580
Who knows them? Nobody even knows the name.

24:51.540 --> 24:53.410
Nobody is even bothered about them.

24:53.740 --> 24:57.620
A single one person was so much used

24:57.910 --> 24:59.740
and was so much tortured.

24:59.990 --> 25:05.410
But despite that, what has happened?

25:05.950 --> 25:09.490
He has got the respect from the whole world.

25:09.950 --> 25:12.830
The whole world respects.

25:14.910 --> 25:19.330
Nobody says that ‘Look at that, how he was crucified,

25:19.700 --> 25:21.950
what has he done …’ Nothing of the kind.

25:23.540 --> 25:28.580
They just respect. And what do they respect? The essence,

25:28.830 --> 25:34.490
the essence of complete innocence.

25:36.410 --> 25:44.370
They say in Sahaja Yoga that he was the incarnation of innocence.

25:45.540 --> 25:51.410
He was the incarnation of Shri Ganesha – which can be verified.

25:52.990 --> 26:00.330
So, when we think that in our own ventures we can do what we like,

26:01.410 --> 26:04.490
and we don’t want to even remember that, we don’t want to even

26:04.870 --> 26:07.700
consider that it’s a wrong thing to do,

26:09.410 --> 26:13.740
we do not know what is ahead of us.

26:14.490 --> 26:16.370
What happened to Hitler also?

26:17.370 --> 26:20.490
He thought he can destroy the whole world,

26:20.700 --> 26:24.290
he can manage to kill so many people

26:24.490 --> 26:29.370
and still he will remain a very great personality.

26:29.700 --> 26:31.870
They are stupid not to understand

26:32.490 --> 26:34.870
who are the people really respected.

26:35.700 --> 26:40.910
Through ages, through history, no-one like Hitler.

26:41.700 --> 26:44.330
He didn’t understand if you wanted to have

26:44.540 --> 26:46.950
really the power over the world,

26:47.490 --> 26:51.410
and he wanted to have the reputation of a great man,

26:51.620 --> 26:53.990
he should have followed the great people.

26:54.740 --> 26:58.540
And the great people are those who are innocent.

26:59.660 --> 27:04.580
Their main power is innocence; take any one of them.

27:05.990 --> 27:10.790
I don’t know how to say that this power acts,

27:11.410 --> 27:13.540
because it acts in so many ways.

27:14.330 --> 27:19.910
You can pass through historical events, so many of them,

27:20.540 --> 27:25.370
and what will you find? A person who is so innocent,

27:25.580 --> 27:29.950
simple and wise

27:32.620 --> 27:37.370
is remembered all your life.

27:37.990 --> 27:41.950
I was a child, very small, when I was in school

27:43.540 --> 27:45.700
I used to go to the library

27:46.950 --> 27:51.740
and read about the lives of great men

27:52.540 --> 27:57.830
who have created some great things for us.

27:58.490 --> 28:00.370
So many of them.

28:00.990 --> 28:03.410
And I was so impressed

28:04.370 --> 28:10.740
how some of them were so simple, so child-like.

28:12.330 --> 28:15.660
For example Abraham Lincoln

28:16.950 --> 28:20.870
for whom I have tremendous, tremendous respect,

28:22.330 --> 28:24.830
was a man tortured by his wife also.

28:25.790 --> 28:28.450
She said “You don’t know, you are very clumsy,

28:28.660 --> 28:34.290
you don’t know how to dress up, you don’t know how to behave”.

28:36.700 --> 28:43.990
And she actually was very harsh on him, all the time torturing him.

28:45.490 --> 28:48.580
Ultimately he was also killed.

28:49.450 --> 28:53.990
So one can say, “You see, what’s the use of being Abraham Lincoln?

28:56.660 --> 29:01.870
Because he was killed, he was not successful.”

29:03.830 --> 29:06.580
Until today, all over the world,

29:06.830 --> 29:10.540
people know who was Abraham Lincoln.

29:12.330 --> 29:14.620
They don’t know his wife – maybe.

29:20.450 --> 29:24.290
But they knew who was Abraham Lincoln, everybody.

29:25.580 --> 29:29.950
Clumsy man, according to her,

29:31.910 --> 29:35.450
and all sorts of degradation for him.

29:36.660 --> 29:42.290
But nobody respects her, nobody thinks anything about her.

29:43.370 --> 29:46.660
Who is respected today is Abraham Lincoln.

29:49.450 --> 29:54.410
Why? ‘Actually he was murdered, he was killed,

29:54.580 --> 29:58.660
that shows that he had no strength to survive’ –

29:59.870 --> 30:02.990
but he survived through ages!

30:05.450 --> 30:09.910
So many years have passed, still he’s surviving.

30:11.700 --> 30:14.490
Take the case of all the great people

30:15.790 --> 30:18.290
who have been innocent;

30:18.870 --> 30:21.330
and that’s why they had ideals.

30:22.290 --> 30:25.580
To them their ideals were more important than anything else,

30:25.910 --> 30:29.620
even their lives. Everything was nothing.

30:30.490 --> 30:33.790
Now the sense of ideals and idealism

30:33.950 --> 30:36.410
comes only from your innocence.

30:36.700 --> 30:41.620
That’s the one which teaches you what is your ideal;

30:42.740 --> 30:44.790
how you should exist;

30:45.740 --> 30:48.990
what kind of a life you should lead.

30:49.910 --> 30:56.580
It is not important that you have big authorities,

30:56.790 --> 31:03.540
or you have a very big positions as ministers and all that.

31:04.290 --> 31:06.790
There have been so many who came and died.

31:08.370 --> 31:11.370
They had so many people with ambitions

31:12.330 --> 31:17.330
and so many people who were oppressive, but where are they?

31:17.870 --> 31:21.370
Nobody’s bothered about them, nobody wants to look at them.

31:23.660 --> 31:27.450
If their photograph appears people close their eyes

31:27.620 --> 31:29.450
‘No, no, we don’t want to see this man’.

31:30.540 --> 31:34.370
But if there’s a little boy, innocent child,

31:34.660 --> 31:37.910
who is talking in a very innocent manner,

31:38.910 --> 31:41.410
the whole world admires that child.

31:41.870 --> 31:45.830
And these great men are, really,

31:46.370 --> 31:49.830
they are the symbols of that innocence.

31:50.740 --> 31:56.370
Their main quality was innocence, from where the wisdom has come.

31:57.330 --> 32:00.790
Ganesha’s main quality is his wisdom.

32:02.990 --> 32:06.830
He knew what was success, through his,

32:08.910 --> 32:11.740
I should say, innocent qualities.

32:12.620 --> 32:16.290
Sometimes the innocent people are not even aware of their

32:16.620 --> 32:18.700
quality of innocence.

32:19.790 --> 32:25.990
It’s very surprising how the quality of innocence

32:26.450 --> 32:30.490
shines through human beings who may be very ordinary,

32:30.990 --> 32:33.540
who may be very

32:39.910 --> 32:45.990
who may be very simple, who may not look so intelligent and sharp,

32:47.330 --> 32:49.990
who may not become good diplomats, what ever it is –

32:50.580 --> 32:56.950
they are innocent! That’s were ends all the glory of human beings.

32:57.830 --> 32:59.580
To be innocent –

33:01.490 --> 33:02.620
What’s the matter?

33:08.370 --> 33:12.490
– so to be innocent, what do you do?

33:12.830 --> 33:18.540
People will say, “Mother, what do we do to be innocent?”

33:19.660 --> 33:27.540
Firstly, you can see for yourself

33:28.660 --> 33:30.490
how your mind works.

33:34.370 --> 33:38.410
What does it do? How it reacts.

33:39.620 --> 33:43.370
This is what one has to watch,

33:43.700 --> 33:45.950
which I call as ‘introspection’.

33:47.910 --> 33:53.450
What sort of plans your mind takes to?

33:54.330 --> 33:59.950
What does it think is the best?

34:00.870 --> 34:03.660
In that thinking, thought process,

34:04.790 --> 34:12.290
what is the most important way to look at yourself?

34:14.990 --> 34:19.410
The first and the foremost is that

34:20.490 --> 34:23.330
you should know how you react to someone.

34:25.540 --> 34:31.370
Is it an innocent reaction? Or it is a vindictive reaction.

34:33.620 --> 34:35.990
It is very easy to see yourself,

34:36.540 --> 34:38.660
because now you are all Sahaja Yogi.

34:39.620 --> 34:43.870
You can see for yourself how is your reaction

34:44.990 --> 34:51.700
to any aggression on you, or any kind of a

34:53.740 --> 34:57.910
trouble coming on you. How do you react to that?

34:59.450 --> 35:01.450
What is your behaviour?

35:02.830 --> 35:07.910
If you are a very powerful person, then your behaviour is –

35:08.700 --> 35:13.450
for that you are not bothered. You see for yourself its

35:13.700 --> 35:16.290
just a stupid thing people are doing to you.

35:16.700 --> 35:18.740
Absolutely stupid.

35:19.450 --> 35:21.540
And when they are doing stupid things,

35:22.660 --> 35:24.580
why should we bother about them?

35:24.910 --> 35:27.700
Why should we waste our energy about them?

35:28.790 --> 35:35.620
It comes to a point where their stupidity is found out,

35:36.660 --> 35:42.290
in such a manner that all their lives and afterwards

35:42.740 --> 35:45.330
they are treated with contempt.

35:45.700 --> 35:47.990
People don’t even want to take their names,

35:48.950 --> 35:51.620
they don’t want to have their photographs,

35:52.540 --> 35:55.740
they don’t want to have anything to do with them.

35:57.330 --> 36:00.580
At this time, at such a juncture,

36:01.660 --> 36:05.700
what happens is the people who are crooks,

36:06.490 --> 36:13.490
who are not innocent, who are against innocence,

36:14.580 --> 36:18.910
they start following them because it suits them better.

36:19.410 --> 36:23.910
It suits them to be aggressive, to be cunning

36:24.910 --> 36:27.660
and that’s how a new group is formed –

36:27.990 --> 36:30.910
which we can call ‘a satanic group’.

36:31.950 --> 36:35.990
And this satanic group also cannot do anything,

36:36.410 --> 36:40.330
anything whatsoever, to an innocent personality.

36:41.370 --> 36:42.990
There is a Sanskrit sloka like that –

36:44.580 --> 36:48.410
Nainam chidanti sashtrani – for the Spirit,

36:48.950 --> 36:52.330
‘It cannot be killed by any weapon’.

36:53.410 --> 36:58.450
Nainam dahanti pavaka – ‘No fire can burn it’.

36:59.330 --> 37:03.580
Sayanam cleydayantaposh naso sathe maratha –

37:03.950 --> 37:09.490
Marutha is the air, or we can call it wind,

37:09.910 --> 37:12.330
‘Wind cannot also suck it’,

37:12.700 --> 37:17.580
it is above all the nature, which is trying to destroy.

37:19.370 --> 37:23.450
But you will be amazed that nature understands.

37:23.910 --> 37:25.870
I told you, nature is innocent.

37:26.740 --> 37:30.580
It understands and it acts

37:31.370 --> 37:37.370
at the right moment, against the person who is aggressive,

37:37.910 --> 37:44.950
who is trying to malign

37:45.540 --> 37:48.330
or trouble an innocent person.

37:50.910 --> 37:56.620
In this way we should know that we have to worship our innocence.

37:57.450 --> 37:59.660
I know sometimes one feels

37:59.910 --> 38:02.330
that you are dominated because of that.

38:03.370 --> 38:08.870
Sometimes one feels sad that  ‘Why you are put to this kind

38:09.370 --> 38:11.410
of a treatment by others’.

38:11.740 --> 38:14.370
All kinds of things come to your mind.

38:14.830 --> 38:17.540
But if you worship your innocence,

38:17.790 --> 38:21.830
then you will be always a happy person,

38:22.660 --> 38:27.330
always a kind person, always be humble person.

38:28.290 --> 38:30.870
So, one has to be careful.

38:31.370 --> 38:32.990
You are your own destroyer!

38:33.660 --> 38:35.830
You are the one who kills, you see

38:36.410 --> 38:37.990
What do you say to it?

38:38.450 --> 38:40.990
Hitler destroyed himself; who has destroyed him?

38:41.410 --> 38:44.740
I mean in any way, everybody has to die so he would have been dead.

38:45.290 --> 38:48.740
But who has destroyed it forever is himself.

38:49.450 --> 38:52.330
So, you kill yourself –

38:52.870 --> 38:56.410
through this you can save yourself

38:56.830 --> 39:01.410
and become very glorified if you are innocent.

39:01.740 --> 39:04.620
Have faith in the power of innocence.

39:05.620 --> 39:11.410
What is important is, how you show in your own life

39:11.990 --> 39:16.990
the power of innocence, how you behave towards each other,

39:17.490 --> 39:20.990
and that is what is what, is what I call ‘the love’.

39:22.540 --> 39:25.450
You cannot be compassionate unless and until

39:26.330 --> 39:28.580
you have this attitude towards yourself.

39:29.580 --> 39:32.580
You cannot be kind. Temporarily you might feel this,

39:32.790 --> 39:36.740
but a permanently compassionate temperament comes

39:36.950 --> 39:41.700
only through the permanent flowing of innocence

39:41.910 --> 39:43.450
through your character.

39:44.410 --> 39:46.950
It’s such a transparent thing in a human being

39:47.990 --> 39:52.950
and that it sustains, it overpowers all other things,

39:53.450 --> 40:00.410
leave alone the time – thousands of years people will not forget

40:00.660 --> 40:05.870
you the Sahaja Yogi, if you show your valour

40:06.740 --> 40:11.290
and your strength of your innocence.

40:11.740 --> 40:15.990
I’m sorry for today’s programme being so late,

40:16.910 --> 40:19.660
but you know I was ready to come

40:21.290 --> 40:26.830
but the marriages are becoming the main function now.

40:28.410 --> 40:30.450
Because it came so late,

40:30.950 --> 40:34.410
that till the last minute we were deciding about marriages.

40:34.910 --> 40:39.370
But I am telling you this is the last time. Next time we’ll stop it.

40:40.330 --> 40:45.580
You must send your applications

40:46.910 --> 40:52.290
at least eight days before, and for Ganapatipule it is two weeks.

40:52.580 --> 40:59.490
Otherwise – there are only twenty-four hours in a day,

41:00.580 --> 41:02.870
and you cannot increase those!

41:03.990 --> 41:07.450
Now there is one humble request I have to make,

41:07.740 --> 41:12.330
that if you want to settle your marriage,

41:12.870 --> 41:18.990
then please do it in a way that I can have time to see.

41:19.830 --> 41:22.620
Otherwise I’ll leave it to others to decide.

41:22.950 --> 41:24.950
If you like, it can be done.

41:26.580 --> 41:29.450
So a simple thing is this to understand,

41:29.740 --> 41:32.290
that marriage is a very important thing.

41:33.330 --> 41:35.950
You can create innocent children if you are married.

41:36.990 --> 41:40.990
But if you behave in this manner, little, little responsible –

41:42.790 --> 41:47.990
so I have to request you to understand the value of time.

41:48.700 --> 41:54.290
Because from next time I can assure you we cannot have marriages

41:54.740 --> 41:58.790
if you send your applications so late.

41:59.450 --> 42:01.870
It should be within one week’s time,

42:03.540 --> 42:05.660
I hope you’ll understand that.

42:05.910 --> 42:07.290
Thank you very much.
