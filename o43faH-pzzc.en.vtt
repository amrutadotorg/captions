00:00:06.642 --> 00:00:13.482
In this country we had a struggle of
freedom. I was a part and parcel of that.

00:00:14.128 --> 00:00:18.868
My parents were part and parcel of that.
They were rich people, quite rich, I should say,

00:00:18.915 --> 00:00:25.995
from every standard. You'll be amazed,
My father burnt all his suits. They were

00:00:25.995 --> 00:00:32.938
stitched in England. My mother burnt all
her saris. They used to spin their own

00:00:32.938 --> 00:00:40.456
clothes and wear them. I had only one coat
throughout My education, when I was in Lahore,

00:00:40.456 --> 00:00:48.487
which is terribly cold, sometimes can be
like London. But we never grudged and

00:00:48.487 --> 00:00:52.118
never grumbled and never said that, "Our
father should have looked after us and done

00:00:52.118 --> 00:00:56.708
something. Why did he just sacrifice everything
for the country?" Never, never, never.

00:00:58.552 --> 00:01:09.462
That quality was created, I should say, by
Mahatma Gandhi. He made everybody so

00:01:09.462 --> 00:01:18.325
transformed into a new personality. All the
money that we had, everything that we had,

00:01:18.325 --> 00:01:25.578
all conveniences, all housing, everything
was given up, not only by My father but

00:01:25.578 --> 00:01:35.644
so many of them otherwise we could not
have got our freedom. To get our freedom

00:01:36.216 --> 00:01:44.366
this country has sacrificed so much.
I must say, Gandhiji had a special charm.

00:01:45.197 --> 00:01:53.017
I don't know how he managed. He was like
'Touch of Midas', touched anybody, he
became transformed, you see.

00:01:57.387 --> 00:02:03.767
And he was an extremely strict man - very
kind to Me, to children - but he was an

00:02:03.767 --> 00:02:10.025
extremely, extremely strict man. He
would not tolerate any nonsense at all.

00:02:12.414 --> 00:02:20.484
Throughout, if you study the way all these
people were brought up, not only for freedom

00:02:20.484 --> 00:02:29.761
of or independence but even before that for
spiritual life, anywhere, there's one thing

00:02:29.761 --> 00:02:35.416
very common, is sacrifice and the
consciousness that you are doing

00:02:35.416 --> 00:02:41.026
something great, consciouness that you
are part and parcel of the Whole.

00:02:41.026 --> 00:02:48.372
People: [Long live Mahatma Gandhi, Long live
Mahatma Gandhi, Long live Mahatma Gandhi]

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:59.679
[People shouting slogans]

00:03:00.624 --> 00:03:06.624
I've seen it with My own eyes such people
in this country, whom you may call legendary

00:03:06.624 --> 00:03:13.897
but I've seen it. Thousands of people were
killed and butchered. Children died -

00:03:13.897 --> 00:03:24.822
nobody shed tears, nobody shed tears. Now,
after that we are here to get our freedom,

00:03:26.192 --> 00:03:36.562
to get the freedom for our Spirit, to 
make our Spirit free from our greed, lust,

00:03:37.058 --> 00:03:43.448
from your anger, from our conditionings,
from our terrible ego.
