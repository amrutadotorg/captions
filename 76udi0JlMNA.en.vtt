Melbourne, Australia

03:11.230 --> 03:18.230
11 April 1991

05:17.760 --> 05:24.760
13:29
Please be seated. I think I’ll stand up

13:29.140 --> 13:36.140
and speak, would be better now.

14:20.990 --> 14:27.990
14:41
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

14:53.459 --> 15:00.459
At the very outset we have to know that truth
is what it is. We cannot conceptualize it,

15:05.740 --> 15:12.740
we cannot change it, we cannot buy it, and
also unfortunately at this human level we

15:18.140 --> 15:25.140
cannot know it. The truth is that you are
not this body, this mind, this intellect,

15:36.459 --> 15:43.459
this ego, these conditionings, but you are
the pure spirit. The second truth is that

15:50.649 --> 15:57.649
there is a all-pervading Power of divine love,
which is very subtle and which works out all

16:04.899 --> 16:06.399
the living work.

16:06.399 --> 16:13.240
You see all these beautiful flowers here,
and we take them for granted. We never even

16:13.240 --> 16:18.110
think from where have they come, how have
they come, from a one little seed how – and

16:18.110 --> 16:25.110
so many varieties, so many types – how they
have been created and how they grow, and how

16:33.230 --> 16:39.970
a flower becomes a fruit. Look at ourselves;
look at our eyes. It’s one of the greatest

16:39.970 --> 16:46.519
cameras you could think of. Look at every
machinery that is within us, how it is working

16:46.519 --> 16:53.519
beautifully there. But we do not think about
it; we take it for granted.

16:54.320 --> 17:01.320
All this living work is done by this all-pervading
Power of divine love. Now when I say that,

17:03.769 --> 17:10.769
you need not accept it blindfolded. But I
would request you to have a scientific mind,

17:12.959 --> 17:19.959
have a scientific attitude that you keep yourself
open. Treat this as a hypothesis, and if it

17:22.289 --> 17:29.289
is proved then you have to accept it as truth,
if you are honest, because it is not only

17:33.450 --> 17:40.450
for individual emancipation but for the emancipation
of the whole world.

17:46.080 --> 17:53.080
As I have told you that truth cannot be understood
or felt at this human level because we are

18:02.320 --> 18:09.320
mental, at the most, if not emotional being,
or we are mixture of both. We are a bundle

18:10.620 --> 18:17.220
of conditionings and egos and everything,
but we are not our selves. When we say “my

18:17.220 --> 18:22.780
ego”, “my intelligence”, “my body”
– but where is this “my”? From where

18:22.780 --> 18:28.730
does this word “my” comes? This is what
is the spirit within us.

18:28.730 --> 18:35.730
You have been already explained about a mechanism
we have here … and you have been already

18:44.530 --> 18:51.530
told this kind of a mechanism exists within
us. (If you remove this one would be better,

18:58.290 --> 19:05.290
I think.) Now this mechanism does exist within
us, and is for your last breakthrough in your

19:08.670 --> 19:15.670
evolutionary process. You have become from
amoeba to a human state, but we have not yet

19:18.760 --> 19:25.760
known the absolute truth. We have not yet
known the absolute knowledge.

19:28.270 --> 19:35.270
[Microphone falls down.] All right, now can
you see that? It’s just for your seeing

19:54.290 --> 20:01.290
we are managing something! It’s all right.
But this is all within yourself, is all within

20:01.799 --> 20:07.840
yourself which is not going to fall out!

20:07.840 --> 20:14.840
So, we have this mechanism, as I told you,
for your last breakthrough. If we had known

20:25.290 --> 20:32.290
the absolute truth and if we had the absolute
knowledge, there would have been no quarrelling,

20:33.030 --> 20:40.030
no different “isms”; there would have
been no wars. But because we haven’t got

20:43.780 --> 20:50.780
that, we are separated by ignorance, and everybody
thinks “I’m right. Whatever I am doing

20:51.530 --> 20:58.530
is the correct thing and whatever I am thinking
is the correct thing.” But there is no way

20:58.770 --> 21:05.770
to judge whether it is correct or not. Like
when you say it’s a one meter long, then

21:06.460 --> 21:13.460
we have a meter, as you know, in the Museum
of Paris which is kept as one meter all the

21:17.919 --> 21:24.919
time. But that, unless and until you discover
we are living in a relative world without

21:28.260 --> 21:35.260
any absolute relativity. That’s why there
is chaos; that’s why there are problems.

21:36.360 --> 21:43.360
Most of the problems if you see are created
by human beings.

21:46.240 --> 21:53.240
These problems, if you just try to locate,
are just based because we haven’t found

21:54.290 --> 22:01.130
out the absolute knowledge. For example, if
this place is completely dark and you can’t

22:01.130 --> 22:07.610
see anyone and if you start all running, you’ll
hit someone, somebody will fall down, somebody

22:07.610 --> 22:14.610
will be beaten up, somebody might get hurt
because there is darkness, there is confusion.

22:17.650 --> 22:23.040
These are the days of the greatest confusion
that we are born in, and it’s promised that

22:23.040 --> 22:28.480
in those days of confusion only you are going
to find out the truth. That’s why there

22:28.480 --> 22:35.480
is a category of people, as William Blake
has said, are the men of God who will find

22:37.120 --> 22:42.549
themselves and they will make others the men
of God.

22:42.549 --> 22:49.549
The time has come for you all to have your
Self-realization, your self-knowledge. As

22:51.040 --> 22:58.040
a result of that you develop a new awareness.
You develop – again I say it’s a question

22:58.160 --> 23:05.160
of becoming; it is not certifying – you
develop a new awareness on your central nervous

23:07.510 --> 23:14.510
system, which we call as “collective consciousness.”
Is described by Jung very clearly. This is

23:16.540 --> 23:23.540
where you can feel your centers on your fingertips,
and you can feel the centers of other people

23:26.820 --> 23:33.820
on your fingertips. Now only thing you have
to do is to know what do they denote – this

23:34.679 --> 23:40.190
decoding has been done already – and how
to correct them.

23:40.190 --> 23:47.190
So, to correct your being physically, mentally,
emotionally and also spiritually, you have

23:47.910 --> 23:54.440
to enter inside your being – which you cannot.
For example, you are paying attention to Me,

23:54.440 --> 24:01.350
but if I say “pay attention to yourself”
you cannot. You cannot pay attention to yourself

24:01.350 --> 24:07.500
inside. So something has to happen, and this
something is the awakening of this residual

24:07.500 --> 24:14.500
power which we call as “kundalini.” It’s
a Sanskrit word: “kundal” means “the

24:15.700 --> 24:22.700
coils” and is there in three-and-a-half
coils, this energy is settled down. If this

24:23.100 --> 24:30.100
energy is awakened, just like a primule in
a seed – it’s a living process – just

24:30.900 --> 24:37.900
like a seed sprouts, this kundalini gets awakened,
passes through six centers, pierces through

24:40.380 --> 24:47.230
the last one, and you yourself feel the cool
breeze coming out of your head. And then for

24:47.230 --> 24:53.490
the first time you start feeling this cool
breeze – it’s not very cool, it’s very

24:53.490 --> 25:00.450
pleasantly cool – which is the all-pervading
Power of divine love.

25:00.450 --> 25:07.450
With this you become like a divine computer.
You can feel the centers which are in trouble

25:11.919 --> 25:18.919
within yourself. You can feel the centers
of people around. You can feel the centers

25:19.190 --> 25:25.440
of people who are far away, also the centers
of people who are dead and gone. That’s

25:25.440 --> 25:31.690
how you can know who was a realized soul who
came on this Earth, and who was a nasty fellow

25:31.690 --> 25:37.900
and who was a devil. Otherwise there is no
way of making out.

25:37.900 --> 25:44.470
For example, from India people get out of
the jail, immediately they wear these saffron-colored

25:44.470 --> 25:51.470
clothes and are in Australia: they become
big gurus. And Australians had lot of money,

25:52.710 --> 25:59.710
and they have really fed them with that. So
many of them are coming down. But not so many,

26:00.350 --> 26:06.690
because so many are exposed also, so many
are in jail, so many have died. But still,

26:06.690 --> 26:10.610
they can say that “the world is coming to
an end, and you must do this. This is happening,

26:10.610 --> 26:13.679
and you must do that”; and just frighten
you.

26:13.679 --> 26:18.970
And you think, “Oh, otherwise, you see,
how can they tell lies?” But they are thieves!

26:18.970 --> 26:25.450
They are coming from the jail direct – you
find out their bona fides: from what kind

26:25.450 --> 26:32.049
of families they come, what sort of education
they have had? But blindfolded, people go

26:32.049 --> 26:38.419
to them and get infected by them. Mostly they
are mesmerizers and they spoil your chances

26:38.419 --> 26:45.270
of your ascent. Not only that: they can give
you some diseases, they can give you some

26:45.270 --> 26:49.610
sort of a brain – you might have an effect
of your taking a drug. Anything can they do,

26:49.610 --> 26:54.750
I don’t know to what extent they can go;
because so many have come to Me, and I am

26:54.750 --> 27:00.539
really now fed up the way people are still
running after them, paying them money. It’s

27:00.539 --> 27:05.000
something like you see some people coming
out of the pub and falling down on the street,

27:05.000 --> 27:12.000
and others try to push their way inside to
get again the same way.

27:12.200 --> 27:18.000
But in spirituality you have to know that
you cannot pay. It’s a living process of

27:18.000 --> 27:25.000
living energy; it’s a living process. (Will
you take photographs afterwards? All right?)

27:30.400 --> 27:37.070
So the second thing that should happen to
you as a result of Self-realization, that

27:37.070 --> 27:44.070
you get empowered yourself. You yourself can
give realizations to others. You can find

27:45.330 --> 27:52.330
out about another person, you can give them
realization, you can cure them. You can help

27:53.429 --> 28:00.429
them in every way possible. It’s like one
enlightened light can enlighten another light.

28:01.100 --> 28:08.000
You are all ready for it, absolutely ready
to get enlightened. I don’t have to do much,

28:08.000 --> 28:14.460
you will see that – how easily you all can
get your realization. It has to be easy, it

28:14.460 --> 28:20.669
has to be sahaj, it has to be spontaneous,
because the time has come. And also this all-pervading

28:20.669 --> 28:27.669
Power has become extremely active, extremely
active, and it is working wonders everywhere.

28:28.270 --> 28:35.270
When the kundalini rises on this center, then
you reach a state which we call as thoughtless

28:38.820 --> 28:43.730
awareness – in Sanskrit it’s called as
“nirvichar samadhi.” When you watch something

28:43.730 --> 28:48.480
you just watch, you don’t think. If you
want to think you can think, but you are not

28:48.480 --> 28:54.100
bombarded by thoughts, you are not under the
control of thoughts. Then she rises above

28:54.100 --> 29:00.590
and pierces through here, and establishes
a connection properly: then you get into another

29:00.590 --> 29:05.909
kind of a higher awareness we call as “nirvikalpa
samadhi”, which is a doubtless awareness,

29:05.909 --> 29:12.909
in which you start raising the kundalini of
others, curing others, helping others, knowing

29:13.710 --> 29:20.030
such a lot of knowledge; because once this
kundalini goes into the limbic area, she enlightens

29:20.030 --> 29:26.059
these thousand petals there – that is the
thousand nerves.

29:26.059 --> 29:33.059
Many children I’ve seen who have been absolutely
very dull children now are scoring above everybody

29:34.190 --> 29:41.190
else, getting scholarships. We have some boys
who have done their engineering or chartered

29:43.720 --> 29:50.409
accountancy and all this thing in very, very
record time; they have records. They always

29:50.409 --> 29:57.409
stand first and they are doing very well in
their education, but despite all that they

29:57.460 --> 30:03.929
are extremely humble and obedient. They respect
their teachers, they respect everyone; because

30:03.929 --> 30:10.929
the new virtue which has come in them is the
respect, to respect others, which we have

30:12.000 --> 30:13.350
lost long time back.

30:13.350 --> 30:20.000
The second thing that happens to a person
is this: that you become absolutely free.

30:20.000 --> 30:25.780
Of course, in the beginning also I respect
your freedom. I cannot force Self-realization

30:25.780 --> 30:32.780
on you – you have to ask for it. Otherwise,
I cannot force it on you. But when you get

30:33.820 --> 30:40.820
your Self-realization you become really free,
in the sense that you are able to be free.

30:41.990 --> 30:48.370
Like we think we are free, but we have addictions,
we are slaves to so many things, we cannot

30:48.370 --> 30:55.370
control ourselves; so we are not free. But
when you become a self-realized person all

30:55.600 --> 30:59.770
such things which dominate us – whether
it’s addiction, alcoholism, any habit, any

30:59.770 --> 31:06.770
such thing, tempers, or too much interest
in wrong things – all drops out and you

31:08.780 --> 31:15.780
become really a able person: absolutely you
have the ability to be enjoying your freedom

31:18.090 --> 31:25.090
and your virtues. Then it happens that you
start seeing everything, as I told you, and

31:29.470 --> 31:31.620
not getting into thoughts.

31:31.620 --> 31:38.620
The human nature is such that whatever you
see, you react. But after getting Self-realization

31:40.200 --> 31:46.770
you do not react, and your mind is thoughtless.
It’s like a lake which has no ripples on

31:46.770 --> 31:53.770
it, and all that is created around that lake
is reflected inside. In the same way when

31:56.419 --> 32:01.669
you watch something, you just watch it. Now
I watch these flowers: I’m just watching,

32:01.669 --> 32:07.789
and all the joy that the Creator has put it
in it, it doesn’t come to Me as words but

32:07.789 --> 32:13.590
as joy itself, and it starts pouring on Me
and it soothes Me down.

32:13.590 --> 32:20.289
You become a person without tension, because
tension comes to you through thoughts. But

32:20.289 --> 32:24.880
thoughts are coming from the past or from
the future, and they throng your head and

32:24.880 --> 32:31.880
give you this tension. When the kundalini
rises she comes in between two thoughts, so

32:35.700 --> 32:42.179
the future and past – the kundalini is in
the center, that is, in the present. So you

32:42.179 --> 32:47.850
just stand in the present, and when you are
in the present there is no tension in your

32:47.850 --> 32:54.710
mind. These days there’s a big trouble people
are having of tensions, blood pressures and

32:54.710 --> 33:01.440
all kinds of things, which are absolutely
there because this window has not yet opened

33:01.440 --> 33:06.630
out. Once it has opened out everything goes
away, and you are extremely a relaxed person.

33:06.630 --> 33:12.620
You also reduce at least ten years of your
age. As you know, I am sixty-eight years of

33:12.620 --> 33:18.960
age and I am travelling every third or fourth
day all over the world. So you get very dynamic

33:18.960 --> 33:24.470
and you get such a lot of energy within you.
At the same time you are very compassionate,

33:24.470 --> 33:31.470
you are very considerate, and you are extremely
wise. In every way you are helped: you are

33:34.340 --> 33:37.309
helped in your business, you are helped in
your work, you are helped in your relationship

33:37.309 --> 33:41.100
with, in your family, with others, and the
whole thing becomes like a beautiful drama

33:41.100 --> 33:42.120
you are playing.

33:42.120 --> 33:47.770
I’m telling, all these things sound very
fantastic to you, and should find – because

33:47.770 --> 33:52.720
you might say “we have never seen such angels
before.” But there is a chance for all of

33:52.720 --> 33:59.720
you to become that. Supposing you take a television
into a remote village of India where they

34:00.320 --> 34:05.710
have never seen a television, and tell them
that “you can see pictures from all over

34:05.710 --> 34:07.140
the world inside this.”

34:07.140 --> 34:11.289
They’ll say, “What, this box? Useless
thing – how can it be?” But when you put

34:11.289 --> 34:16.789
it to the mains, then they see the miracles
of it. In the same way when you are put it,

34:16.789 --> 34:21.720
you are put to the mains you start seeing
the miracles of your being. Then you understand

34:21.720 --> 34:28.720
how glorified you are, how beautiful you are,
and what is the purpose of your life.

34:29.329 --> 34:34.820
There’s no end to this knowledge. For example,
in here so many lights I see here, but to

34:34.820 --> 34:41.820
put them on there might be only one switch
and you can put on all the lights. But supposing

34:43.310 --> 34:47.800
I have to tell you all the history, how it
came and how the electricity came, and then

34:47.800 --> 34:53.570
how it was brought in Melbourne and how it
was fixed and everything, it’s quite boring.

34:53.570 --> 34:58.900
So the best thing is just to put on the light
first. So I would request you, you’d better

34:58.900 --> 35:05.150
have your Self-realization first and then
understand, because it’s a very subtle subject

35:05.150 --> 35:09.440
and I don’t know how many thousand lectures
I have given only in English language. There

35:09.440 --> 35:16.230
are many other languages I speak, but only
in English language I don’t know how many

35:16.230 --> 35:19.830
lectures I have given, and every time they
say, “Mother, every time You say something

35:19.830 --> 35:26.830
new.” I am giving you thus a introduction
to Sahaja Yoga.

35:26.920 --> 35:33.920
Now, once you get your realization you have
to know it works on collectivity. It’s not

35:34.040 --> 35:38.830
that you go home and say, “All right, Mother,
I am meditating at home.” It would be like

35:38.830 --> 35:45.070
a nail cut out of the body. You don’t have
to pay for anything, but you have to give

35:45.070 --> 35:50.200
some time for your Self-realization and you
have to come to the collective. Luckily in

35:50.200 --> 35:55.260
Melbourne we have wonderful people who have
achieved great heights in Sahaja Yoga. They

35:55.260 --> 36:01.280
are extremely humble, they are extremely beautiful
people, and I’m sure they’ll help you

36:01.280 --> 36:04.170
to achieve the same heights as they have achieved.

36:04.170 --> 36:10.130
This is what we have to get. We have to emancipate
the human beings to solve all our problems,

36:10.130 --> 36:16.089
to enter into the Kingdom of God. This has
been promised, and this promise has to be

36:16.089 --> 36:23.089
fulfilled. Of course, before I go ahead with
the process of Self-realization which will

36:23.220 --> 36:30.220
take ten minutes only, I would request you
to ask Me questions. But ask relevant questions,

36:32.070 --> 36:38.680
questions which show your curiosity to get
your realization, because I’m not here for

36:38.680 --> 36:45.680
any votes, nor am I here for any money. I
am here to give you your own key of your own

36:45.790 --> 36:52.790
treasures. So accordingly, please ask Me questions.
I’ll be very thankful to you. May God bless

37:07.390 --> 37:08.890
you.

37:08.890 --> 37:15.890
[Question: He says he thinks he is reaching
that stage, but could You tell him the symptoms?]

37:33.960 --> 37:40.960
Yes. We’ll tell him. You see, first what
happens, that you start feeling the cool breeze

37:46.950 --> 37:53.520
out of your head. Sometimes you might get
hot also, hot breeze coming out; then you

37:53.520 --> 38:00.520
start feeling the cool breeze all around it.
Then you become aware of it and you work it

38:04.599 --> 38:11.550
out. Then you give realizations to others.
All these things happen, and you become extremely

38:11.550 --> 38:17.430
peaceful, loving, affectionate, and a righteous
person – you become. It’s not like following

38:17.430 --> 38:24.089
any religion as such, because when we follow
a religion we can do, we can commit any mistakes;

38:24.089 --> 38:31.089
any sins we can commit. But Sahaja Yoga is
such that religion is born within you – like

38:31.250 --> 38:35.339
here, as we have got eight valencies within
us, ten valencies within us, and these ten

38:35.339 --> 38:40.300
valencies are in this green part: when they’re
awakened, you become religious. You become.

38:40.300 --> 38:44.910
You are not to be told, you just become. I
don’t have to tell you “don’t do this”

38:44.910 --> 38:51.910
– I never say that. It just happens, because
you see in the light what is right and what

38:52.520 --> 38:56.080
is wrong.

38:56.080 --> 39:03.080
[Question: What is God, for You, and is God
a separate entity?]

39:17.010 --> 39:21.480
Ya, He is. He is, and God for Me is the one
who is witnessing everything. But He has His

39:21.480 --> 39:27.510
Power which is the Primordial Mother, which
is the Holy Ghost, which is reflected within

39:27.510 --> 39:34.510
you as the kundalini, and God is reflected
within you as the spirit in your heart. At

39:36.510 --> 39:41.339
this point they meet, and that’s how you
get your Self-realization. But such a wide

39:41.339 --> 39:48.339
subject it is, so you have to have more patience
for such a wider subject.

39:48.550 --> 39:55.550
[Question: Will there ever come a time when
the negative force in society will cease to

40:16.830 --> 40:18.589
exist?]

40:18.589 --> 40:25.589
Yes, of course, if you help us.

40:26.270 --> 40:29.660
[Question: Which Indian saints or masters
do You acknowledge, or did any of them inspire

40:29.660 --> 40:31.680
You in Your cause?]

40:31.680 --> 40:38.589
Yah, all of them were there, and there are
some more but they have all disappeared in

40:38.589 --> 40:44.730
the Himalayas, because they say that “these
human beings are absolutely dullards and they

40:44.730 --> 40:51.730
won’t listen to us; You try Your luck!”
We have so many saints in India who are no

40:54.770 --> 41:01.359
more, who really came down to the masses.
The first one who really ventured to talk

41:01.359 --> 41:05.760
to masses was Gyaneshwara, Saint Gyaneshwara.

41:05.760 --> 41:11.329
About kundalini it was written in so many
Sanskrit books, so many of them, you see,

41:11.329 --> 41:17.589
but never in a local or a vernacular language.
So Gyaneshwara in the twelfth century first

41:17.589 --> 41:23.990
time talked about it. He took the permission
of his master – because it was a tradition

41:23.990 --> 41:30.990
to have one master and one disciple – and
he wrote it about it in his book first of

41:31.260 --> 41:38.260
all. And today the time has come for you to
get en masse realization. There are so many

41:38.300 --> 41:44.849
saints that I really, in this thing I cannot
tell you, but there was Ramadasa, there is

41:44.849 --> 41:51.849
Nanaka, there is Kabira – so many of them
– Adi Shankaracharya; in India, as you ask.

41:54.070 --> 42:01.070
But outside also: William Blake was another
saint.

42:02.770 --> 42:09.770
[Question: He says that T.M. talks about Self-realization.
What is the difference between their talking

42:39.420 --> 42:42.300
about Self-realization and You talking about
it?]

42:42.300 --> 42:47.329
Now they have started. They never talked about
it before, and they are just talking. If I

42:47.329 --> 42:51.790
have to tell you everything frankly about
T.M., it’s better that you listen to it.

42:51.790 --> 42:58.790
I’m not afraid of them. I had the head of
their siddha – what they call the “flying

43:00.190 --> 43:07.190
academy” – head of that, the director,
one Mr. Peter Pearce, his wife, his deputy

43:08.089 --> 43:13.440
director and his child, all suffering from
epilepsy, came to Me. Luckily My husband was

43:13.440 --> 43:19.800
not at home those days, so I kept them in
My house and treated them, and got them well.

43:19.800 --> 43:23.119
He’s about to write a book about it.

43:23.119 --> 43:28.790
Now I asked him what do they do. So he told
Me – because he was in it – he said that

43:28.790 --> 43:35.230
they give three mantras, first stage they
give three mantras, and these three mantras,

43:35.230 --> 43:42.230
they were to pay three thousand pounds. Now
these three mantras, out of them any one could

43:43.030 --> 43:50.030
be yours. One was “inga”, another was
“pinga”, another was “tinga”. Now

43:51.720 --> 43:56.550
any Indian would laugh at it because they
know there is, these are not Sanskrit words.

43:56.550 --> 44:01.310
“Inga” means the scorpion bite; the “pinga”
means a person when he gets possessed, he

44:01.310 --> 44:06.290
goes round, is called “pinga” – it is
also in vernacular language, not in Sanskrit

44:06.290 --> 44:13.290
– and “tinga” means showing like this.
And they paid three thousand – done! It’s

44:13.310 --> 44:16.640
all marketing. People are so stupid!

44:16.640 --> 44:23.640
I mean, I have a disciple who came to Me from
T.M., her sister was in lunatic asylum. We

44:24.190 --> 44:28.640
had to work so hard on her, but now she’s
cured; and this barrister girl, poor thing,

44:28.640 --> 44:34.450
she suffered so much. So many people have
gone into recluses. She told Me that she had

44:34.450 --> 44:41.450
to go to Switzerland, pay six thousand pounds
for a course of seven days. And the first

44:41.579 --> 44:46.550
day they were given – this is for flying
in the air. Now this is also another stupidity,

44:46.550 --> 44:52.490
to go for flying in the air, half-way through
– what is the need? As it is, today there

44:52.490 --> 44:59.490
was such a lot of jam; you see, if you start
flying like this, then no car can move! What

45:01.490 --> 45:06.740
is the need for you to fly at three feet?
But this is stupidity, and for that stupidity

45:06.740 --> 45:12.930
she paid six thousand pounds. And she had
to go to Switzerland, and she said, “No

45:12.930 --> 45:18.230
arrangements for us, nothing. We were to live
in a big hall, and they asked us that we have

45:18.230 --> 45:25.230
to jump on, what you call these foam mattresses,”
and she broke her bottom, and many broke their

45:27.609 --> 45:34.609
bottom. And they were asked, they were asked
to give. And they were given to drink the

45:35.060 --> 45:41.280
water that boiled the potatoes for six days,
and the seventh day they were given the rind,

45:41.280 --> 45:48.280
and the fifth day the potatoes. For that they
paid six thousand pounds! She’s a daughter

45:49.579 --> 45:51.920
of a very, very rich man.

45:51.920 --> 45:57.650
But this is what it is, if you have surplus
money there are people to befool you. There’s

45:57.650 --> 46:04.550
a market, it’s all marketing. Now they are
marketing what you call ayurveda. What is

46:04.550 --> 46:09.900
there to market ayurveda? You can buy things
directly from India; you don’t need a guru

46:09.900 --> 46:15.180
for that. And most of the ayurveda cannot
be practiced abroad because these are made

46:15.180 --> 46:21.960
out of fresh leaves. But if you have to treat
yourself with ayurveda you can go to India.

46:21.960 --> 46:28.480
But Sahaja Yoga is a direct method that you
can cure yourself by, with your kundalini

46:28.480 --> 46:35.480
awakening. There are two doctors in Delhi
University who have got their M.D. on Sahaja

46:37.150 --> 46:43.960
Yoga, which proved that Sahaja Yoga can cure
many incurable diseases. We have cured. Not

46:43.960 --> 46:50.960
that I have cured, but people are cured through
Sahaja Yoga. Diseases like blood cancer, myelitis,

46:53.200 --> 46:58.380
so many diseases have been cured, and there
are so many that I really do not know how

46:58.380 --> 47:02.589
to even keep account. We cannot keep account
of them.

47:02.589 --> 47:07.790
So this is what T.M. is. Whatever they talk,
they should prove it. Have you met any T.M.

47:07.790 --> 47:14.790
fellow who can give realizations to others,
or who can talk like Stephen? There is no

47:17.869 --> 47:24.130
modus operandi. There is no modus operandi
they can describe – nothing. On the contrary,

47:24.130 --> 47:29.839
if you are a doctor you can find them out
just like that. Once in a lecture there was

47:29.839 --> 47:36.839
a Sahaja yogi, who is now head of the Psychology
Department in Amman – he was there in their

47:37.520 --> 47:42.579
meetings – and they said that when you take
the brain scan, you see the theta waves. Immediately

47:42.579 --> 47:48.810
he got up, he said, “But you get it with
epilepsy; you get it with epilepsy.”

47:48.810 --> 47:53.099
And they were shocked. They just got round
him and said, “Doctor, will you come and

47:53.099 --> 47:57.180
have some tea with us?” and this. Then he
went there and they were offering him money

47:57.180 --> 48:04.180
and all that. Is all money business. If you
have intelligence you can understand it, that

48:04.720 --> 48:10.319
it’s all money. You cannot purchase it.
How much money did you give to Christ? How

48:10.319 --> 48:17.319
much money did you give to Krishna or to Rama,
or to any one of them? Those people whom you

48:18.069 --> 48:25.069
can purchase are your servants; they cannot
be your gurus.

48:26.670 --> 48:33.670
[Seeker: I was in Siddha Yoga for seven years
and I have a lot of problems.]

48:36.920 --> 48:39.030
You will, but I know that, I’ll manage that.
It’s very difficult, but I’ll manage.

48:39.030 --> 48:42.230
I know, with all these yogas you get nothing
but trouble. I know that.

48:42.230 --> 48:47.210
[Seeker: I tend to get very sleepy and tired,
and meditation makes me even sleepier.]

48:47.210 --> 48:54.210
I know. I know that. I’ll help you, don’t
you worry. I’ll help you, all right? Definitely.

48:56.460 --> 49:00.849
I know this is not only your case, it’s
so many. But in Australia he was so popular.

49:00.849 --> 49:07.650
I don’t know why he was so popular here.
You are supposed to be much more intelligent

49:07.650 --> 49:12.630
than normal people! Aren’t you?

49:12.630 --> 49:19.630
[Question: What are Your views on eating meat,
as opposed to vegetarianism?]

49:24.589 --> 49:31.589
You see, we, in Sahaja Yoga we treat a person
according to his needs. Supposing you need

49:35.970 --> 49:41.359
proteins, you have to have proteins. Supposing
you need more carbohydrates, so you have to

49:41.359 --> 49:46.480
have carbohydrates. It’s a balancing thing.
By eating meat or anything – like you think,

49:46.480 --> 49:53.150
if you save some chickens, can I give them
realization? Simple question. So we are paying

49:53.150 --> 49:57.240
too much attention to all nonsensical things.
What you have to think, what we are human

49:57.240 --> 50:04.240
beings on top of everything. Of course, some
people don’t have to eat meat because they

50:04.270 --> 50:11.270
have problems; but some people have to eat
meat because they have problems. We have to

50:12.970 --> 50:19.970
be logical about everything.

50:21.490 --> 50:28.490
These are all fads, or “isms”. These are
fads: don’t do this, wear this kind of a

50:29.109 --> 50:34.339
dress, go on the street and sing “Hare Rama,
Hare Krishna” or do another nonsensical

50:34.339 --> 50:40.849
thing, or jump here. These are all fads and
fashions. The fashion started that you should

50:40.849 --> 50:46.130
put a tin on your head and tie up your hair,
bouffant or something. Everybody started doing

50:46.130 --> 50:52.579
that. We must have our individuality, we should
have our personality. How can we accept anything

50:52.579 --> 50:56.900
that comes in the way? And these entrepreneurs
are playing with you, so these gurus also

50:56.900 --> 51:01.300
play with you. We should be alert now – we
have already suffered a lot, haven’t we?

51:01.300 --> 51:08.300
[Question: What’s Your opinion of Swami
Muktananda?]

51:09.740 --> 51:16.740
Ah. Better not ask! You know, I have got just
now a complete file on him, from America they

51:20.730 --> 51:25.099
have published: he’s such a horrible man.
If you want you can read it, but I assure

51:25.099 --> 51:32.099
you will not be able to eat food for at least
eight days. He had relations with even thirteen-year-old

51:32.170 --> 51:39.170
girls. What are you asking about a swami like
that? Useless fellow!

51:39.230 --> 51:42.310
[Question: Sai Baba?]

51:42.310 --> 51:49.030
Another horrible person. He is giving you
diamonds. Who has given diamonds to others?

51:49.030 --> 51:55.540
Who wants diamonds? From where does he get
diamonds? You know that very well. He gets

51:55.540 --> 52:02.540
even Swiss watches. People are so stupid!
You are talking of spirituality and of God,

52:02.910 --> 52:07.660
not of these mundane things. If you want you
can go in the market and get a diamond; even

52:07.660 --> 52:14.660
if you don’t get, doesn’t matter. Those
who have it or have not, nothing wrong with

52:17.280 --> 52:23.000
them. Look at his, their faces, how they look.

52:23.000 --> 52:29.339
I tell you, how can you be enamored by these
things? You always talk of materialism, you

52:29.339 --> 52:35.170
talk against it and then you get enamored
by these people because they are in America.

52:35.170 --> 52:41.349
When I went there in Boston – can you imagine,
Americans are the best for this – so that

52:41.349 --> 52:43.720
they asked Me, “How many Rolls-Royces You
have?”

52:43.720 --> 52:45.010
I said, “I have none.”

52:45.010 --> 52:52.010
They said, “Then we are not interested in
You.” Can you imagine? If you are going

52:52.960 --> 52:58.710
to impress by these things you are not going
to get to the real thing – is definite.

52:58.710 --> 53:05.710
These all things can be bought by money, but
you cannot buy reality with money. Take it

53:05.990 --> 53:10.530
from Me, you cannot. It has to happen – is
a fact. I am telling you the truth, whether

53:10.530 --> 53:10.780
you like it or not.

53:10.550 --> 53:14.020
[Question: Is there an energy field that is
built up by raising the kundalini en masse,

53:14.020 --> 53:21.020
and does it spill over into another area?]

53:50.710 --> 53:55.359
I think, you see, before describing it you’d
better feel it. All right? What’s the use

53:55.359 --> 54:02.359
of describing the beautiful Australia unless
and until you visit it? Better feel it yourself

54:03.170 --> 54:10.170
and then you will know. All right? Yes?

54:11.930 --> 54:18.930
[Question from seeker about kundalini raising
giving her headaches.]

54:21.780 --> 54:28.780
She’s a … With whom did she do this kundalini
awakening? Do you know? …. Ah, must be somebody

54:36.089 --> 54:42.609
like that. You see, kundalini is your mother,
all right, and she is anxious to give you

54:42.609 --> 54:49.160
a second birth. She works it out herself,
beautifully, like your mother gave you the

54:49.160 --> 54:56.160
birth without giving you any trouble. That’s
how she works it out. But if you go to a person

55:00.230 --> 55:07.230
who’s not authorized spiritually, they do
all these things. I have not seen, but – now

55:08.440 --> 55:14.579
as they must have told you that we are working
in about fifty-four nations, and I must have

55:14.579 --> 55:19.280
visited at least forty-five of them – I
have never seen anybody suffering because

55:19.280 --> 55:26.280
of kundalini awakening. On the contrary, feeling
very much better. This is what it is. You

55:26.309 --> 55:33.309
must see first of all when you go to somebody:
what about the disciples, how are they? How

55:35.319 --> 55:42.200
are they behaving? Are they beautiful people?
Have they achieved anything, have they got

55:42.200 --> 55:49.030
anything? And also you must see the life of
the so-called guru. How does he live? Where

55:49.030 --> 55:56.030
is his interest? But headlong if you fall
into something you are going to suffer, isn’t

55:57.170 --> 56:04.170
it? Now I’ve been coming to Australia for
the last, how many, from the year ’78 I

56:04.280 --> 56:11.280
think, ’77 or ’78; but I saw all the people
were scattered around these people, not around

56:11.900 --> 56:18.900
Me. They all like them, all such kinds. They
wouldn’t come to Me. Even some people advised

56:22.619 --> 56:24.780
Me that “You’d better charge some money.”

56:24.780 --> 56:30.079
I said, “How much will you pay? Tell Me.”
This is invaluable – you can’t pay for

56:30.079 --> 56:30.329
it.

56:30.099 --> 56:33.589
[Question: Could You suggest anything that
would help her, now that she’s in that situation,

56:33.589 --> 56:35.109
please?]

56:35.109 --> 56:42.109
Help! Doesn’t matter, we have people there
also. You give us her address, we’ll find

56:47.880 --> 56:54.880
out for her. Australia and Iceland’s quite
close, isn’t it! But sweet of you to remember

56:55.280 --> 56:55.849
her.

56:55.849 --> 57:02.849
[Question: When she meditates she feels the
kundalini rising, but suddenly it drops down

57:17.640 --> 57:24.640
again. How does she keep it up?]

57:35.790 --> 57:42.790
You have been in Sahaja Yoga? Did you get
your realization through Sahaja Yoga? You

57:46.550 --> 57:51.250
see, we do not take responsibility of people
who have been to other places, but if you

57:51.250 --> 57:56.829
have been in Sahaja Yoga then we can find
out why it is happening. If you have got your

57:56.829 --> 58:02.230
realization through Sahaja Yoga we know, and
we can help you very much better. All right?

58:02.230 --> 58:07.900
Then it’s our responsibility. It does happen
sometimes because if you have problems in

58:07.900 --> 58:13.819
your brain, or maybe in your body there is
some disease where the kundalini wants to

58:13.819 --> 58:19.089
help, may be happening, but it can be expedited,
it can be cleared out. These are all the problems

58:19.089 --> 58:26.089
which can be solved. You should have patience
with yourself, that’s all.

58:38.819 --> 58:45.819
[Question: Could You explain levels of samadhi
and nirvana?]

58:50.440 --> 58:56.260
Ah? Nirvana? …. It’s too early to talk
about it, but first you get your samadhi,

58:56.260 --> 59:03.260
all right, step by step, step by step. Nirvana
is the same as samadhi is, but in nirvana

59:04.930 --> 59:11.930
state the, it’s the highest that you can
achieve in spirituality. All right? So it’s

59:12.200 --> 59:19.200
step by step we have to move. We can say it
is the beginning of nirvana and then you have

59:24.460 --> 59:31.460
to be working it out and you go to nirvana
itself, into the complete state. But one thing

59:31.589 --> 59:38.589
is definite there, that we have to understand
that these words we have read from some books

59:42.290 --> 59:49.290
and the connotation of them, it could be very,
very wrong, could be very, very misunderstood.

59:51.220 --> 59:58.220
So whatever is the reality you should face
it as reality, you should see it as reality:

59:59.980 --> 01:00:06.500
not to have any concept about it, because
if you have a concept then may be that it

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:13.500
might be wrong. So it’s better to see for
yourself. All right?

01:00:23.079 --> 01:00:30.079
[Question: Is it possible for the kundalini
to be raised prematurely, or does it just

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:57.640
rise in its own time?]

01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:03.460
Prematurely? This is …

01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:03.710
[Question: Is it dangerous? – there are
lots of written warnings that kundalini can

01:01:03.650 --> 01:01:03.900
be dangerous?]

01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:07.540
No, there is no danger at all in kundalini
awakening at all. As I have told you just

01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:12.780
now, she’s your mother. There’s no danger.
But people must have warnings because they

01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:17.690
don’t want you to get realization, perhaps.
One might have warned because they must have

01:01:17.690 --> 01:01:23.410
put their hands into some sort of a burning
fire, thinking it is the kundalini. So that

01:01:23.410 --> 01:01:30.410
must be the reason. So far, we have had thousands
and thousands and thousands of people: nobody

01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:37.260
has felt anything bad. After all, when you
became a human being, what was the danger

01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:40.839
in becoming human being from a monkey stage?
Did you feel the cutting of your tail even?

01:01:40.839 --> 01:01:47.839
So after all, you are made a human being for
a purpose, and that purpose is to make you

01:01:53.520 --> 01:02:00.339
the higher being. How can it be troublesome?
It is so vitally important. Why should it

01:02:00.339 --> 01:02:07.339
be troublesome to you? Use logic. If that
is the last breakthrough of your evolution,

01:02:12.089 --> 01:02:19.089
it has to work spontaneously and easily.

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:28.520
Now, so there’s one more gentleman but now
this is the last, all right? What is the question?

01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:40.190
Can you get up, please? We can’t even see
you. Thank you.

01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:47.260
[Question: Does Self-realization have to take
place in this life or if you believe in reincarnation,

01:02:51.650 --> 01:02:57.349
does it take place over a longer period?]

01:02:57.349 --> 01:03:03.589
Some people are realized in last life, I know.
They are born as realized souls also, I know.

01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:10.559
But I know one thing, that they don’t know
all about it – partly they know. They have

01:03:10.559 --> 01:03:17.559
to know all about it. They have to know all
about their powers. They have to know how

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:23.780
to raise the kundalini. They have to know
what is missing in their realization. All

01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:29.190
that they have to know.

01:03:29.190 --> 01:03:36.190
All right. So now, very simple thing we have
to do, raise …. As you know, we have to

01:03:37.349 --> 01:03:43.000
use the force of the Mother Earth very much.
For that we have to take out our shoes for

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:50.000
a very short time. Those who are sitting on
the ground just have to take out shoes, that’s

01:03:54.089 --> 01:03:59.910
all, and sit comfortably.

01:03:59.910 --> 01:04:06.910
We have the left and the right, two sides,
left and right sympathetic nervous system.

01:04:25.619 --> 01:04:32.619
The left caters to our emotional side, and
the right to our physical and our mental side.

01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:44.210
So we put both our feet apart from each other
– but those who are sitting on the ground

01:04:44.210 --> 01:04:49.339
are all right, no problem – those who are
not sitting on the ground. They can sit comfortably

01:04:49.339 --> 01:04:56.339
there, just folded. Just sit whichever way
you like, folded is better. Be comfortable

01:04:56.460 --> 01:05:01.520
is the point.

01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:08.520
Before we start anything else, there are two
conditions which you have to fulfill. The

01:05:09.730 --> 01:05:16.730
first one is that you have to know that you
are a human being, and you have to be confident

01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:29.380
that you will get your realization and that
it is your right to get your Self-realization.

01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:42.480
You are not to feel guilty about whatever
has happened in the past, because the divine

01:05:45.530 --> 01:05:52.530
love is the ocean of forgiveness, and whatever
mistakes you might have committed can be easily

01:05:58.780 --> 01:06:03.049
dissolved by that ocean of forgiveness.

01:06:03.049 --> 01:06:09.579
You must have faith in the power of that ocean.
After all, you are a human being, you are

01:06:09.579 --> 01:06:15.920
not God, and if you have done any mistakes
it’s all right. So don’t feel guilty,

01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:19.900
don’t condemn yourselves. Those who have
told you “you are sinners,” you should

01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:23.950
know they must be the greatest sinners to
say that. Nobody has business to say that

01:06:23.950 --> 01:06:30.950
to anyone. So please have full confidence
in yourself, and not to feel guilty. When

01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:36.119
you feel guilty, then this center here on
the back side there catches on, on the left

01:06:36.119 --> 01:06:43.119
side, and this gives you horrible diseases
like angina, lethargic organs and also spondylitis.

01:06:51.010 --> 01:06:56.380
So why to feel guilty for nothing at all?
If you think you have done mistakes, forget

01:06:56.380 --> 01:07:00.619
it just now.

01:07:00.619 --> 01:07:07.619
Second condition is that you have to forgive
everyone in general. You don’t have to think

01:07:09.799 --> 01:07:16.799
about people whom you want to forgive. Whether
you forgive or don’t forgive, you don’t

01:07:17.420 --> 01:07:22.890
do anything. Again, logically you don’t
do anything – it’s just a myth; but if

01:07:22.890 --> 01:07:29.890
you don’t forgive then you play into wrong
hands, in the sense those who wanted to torture

01:07:30.250 --> 01:07:37.250
you or trouble you, they are quite happy,
but you are suffering mentally. So the best

01:07:38.309 --> 01:07:45.309
thing is to forgive everyone in general, not
even thinking about any individual whatsoever.

01:07:47.140 --> 01:07:54.140
This is a very, very important condition.
Every time I have seen everywhere that people

01:07:56.400 --> 01:08:02.950
just don’t forgive, and I have to work hard
on them. So best is, to make My situation

01:08:02.950 --> 01:08:09.950
better and to make the whole thing work out
faster, please, for My sake forgive everyone,

01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:21.240
everyone. These are the two conditions. That’s
all.

01:08:26.429 --> 01:08:33.429
(… You know, I don’t need that now. Too
… )

01:08:39.239 --> 01:08:46.239
Now please put your left hand towards Me,
and right hand on your heart. The spirit is

01:08:55.039 --> 01:09:02.039
residing in your heart. Left hand on your
lap, just on your lap please, comfortably.

01:09:16.719 --> 01:09:23.719
Now. Now we are working only on the left-hand
side with right hand, because right hand is

01:09:27.789 --> 01:09:34.529
for action and left hand is for desire. So
when you put the left hand towards Me, you

01:09:34.529 --> 01:09:40.539
are desiring to have your Self-realization;
and with the right hand you are nourishing

01:09:40.539 --> 01:09:44.150
your centers, yourself raising your own kundalini.

01:09:44.150 --> 01:09:51.150
Now take down your right hand in the upper
portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side.

01:09:55.669 --> 01:10:02.669
This is the center which all the prophets
have created for us, all the great masters

01:10:06.209 --> 01:10:13.209
have created for our mastery: mastery over
the divine work, divine laws. Now we take

01:10:22.050 --> 01:10:29.050
down our hand in the lower portion of our
abdomen on the left-hand side. This is the

01:10:29.619 --> 01:10:36.619
center of pure knowledge. This knowledge manifests
on your central nervous system. This is what

01:10:41.630 --> 01:10:46.530
is called is “bodh” from where the word
“Buddha” has come, or “Ved” from the

01:10:46.530 --> 01:10:51.949
word “vida” – meaning “feeling on
your central nervous system.” As the Gnostic:

01:10:51.949 --> 01:10:57.489
“gn” means “to know.” “Know” doesn’t
mean mentally, but to know on your central

01:10:57.489 --> 01:11:04.489
nervous system. That’s the pure knowledge.

01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:10.939
Now you raise your right hand in the upper
portion of your abdomen and press it hard,

01:11:10.939 --> 01:11:17.939
on the left-hand side. Again you take your
hand onto your heart. Now please put your

01:11:30.389 --> 01:11:37.389
right hand in the corner of your neck and
your shoulder, and turn your head to your

01:11:39.199 --> 01:11:46.199
right. This is the center I’ve told you
already is in trouble when you feel guilty.

01:11:55.469 --> 01:12:02.469
Now please take your right hand on to your
forehead across, and put down your head as

01:12:07.919 --> 01:12:14.919
far as possible. This is the center where
you have to forgive everyone in general. Now

01:12:24.849 --> 01:12:29.900
take back this right hand on the back side
of your head, and push back your head. Push

01:12:29.900 --> 01:12:36.900
back your head as far as possible. Here, without
feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes,

01:12:41.719 --> 01:12:48.719
you have to say, “Oh divine Power, please
forgive me if I have done anything wrong,

01:12:49.409 --> 01:12:56.409
knowingly or unknowingly.” That I’ll tell
you later on; just now I’m telling you the

01:12:57.449 --> 01:12:57.809
position.

01:12:57.809 --> 01:13:04.809
Now stretch your palm fully. Put the center
of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area

01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:15.320
here. And now press it hard. Press down your
head. Press it hard, push back your fingers

01:13:25.489 --> 01:13:32.489
and start moving your scalp with the pressure,
seven times clockwise. This is important.

01:13:35.539 --> 01:13:42.539
Push back your fingers. Put down your head
fully and now go on moving your scalp seven

01:13:44.150 --> 01:13:51.150
times clockwise, very slowly. Now take down
your hands.

01:14:14.260 --> 01:14:21.260
Now you have to close your eyes. Before that
you can take out your spectacles, because

01:14:24.709 --> 01:14:31.709
you are not to open your eyes till I tell
you; this might help your eyesight. Now please

01:14:36.459 --> 01:14:43.459
remember to put your feet on, away from each
other a little bit. If there’s anything

01:14:49.749 --> 01:14:56.749
tight on your neck or on your waist, you can
loosen it a little bit.

01:14:59.949 --> 01:15:06.949
Now put your right hand on your heart. Here
you ask Me a very fundamental question – you

01:15:22.010 --> 01:15:29.010
can call Me “Shri Mataji” or “Mother”,
whatever you like – “Mother, am I the

01:15:29.260 --> 01:15:36.260
spirit? Mother, am I the spirit?” Ask this
in your heart three times.

01:15:44.959 --> 01:15:51.959
If you are the spirit then you become your
own master, because in the light of the spirit

01:15:56.409 --> 01:16:03.409
you see everything clearly. So now please
take your hand in the upper portion of your

01:16:05.150 --> 01:16:12.150
abdomen on the left-hand side, press it hard.
Here you have to say, again a question you

01:16:19.719 --> 01:16:26.719
have to ask Me, “Mother, am I my own master?”
Ask this question three times, “Mother,

01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:40.880
am I my own master?” Three times, in your
heart. As I told you, I respect your freedom

01:17:11.539 --> 01:17:18.030
and I cannot force pure knowledge on you,
so you have to ask for it.

01:17:18.030 --> 01:17:25.030
Take your right hand in the lower portion
of your abdomen on the left-hand side and

01:17:28.929 --> 01:17:35.929
here you say six times, because this center
has got six petals, “Mother, please give

01:17:40.419 --> 01:17:47.419
me self-knowledge” – or you can say “pure
knowledge” – “Mother, please give me

01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:55.380
pure knowledge.” Say it six times.

01:18:18.959 --> 01:18:25.959
Now, raise your right hand in the upper portion
of your abdomen on the left-hand side. As

01:18:52.689 --> 01:18:59.689
you have asked for pure knowledge, your kundalini
has started moving upward, so we have to nourish

01:19:02.219 --> 01:19:09.219
these upper centers with self-confidence.
So here you say ten times, “Mother, I am

01:19:16.630 --> 01:19:23.630
my own master.” Say it with full self-confidence,
ten times, “Mother, I am my own master.”

01:19:34.289 --> 01:19:41.289
I have already told you that the most important
truth about is that you are not this body,

01:19:52.239 --> 01:19:59.239
not mind, not your conditionings, your ego,
but you are pure spirit. So now raise your

01:19:59.809 --> 01:20:06.809
right hand on your heart and say here with
full confidence, twelve times, “Mother,

01:20:15.489 --> 01:20:22.489
I am the spirit.” Please say it twelve times.

01:20:42.539 --> 01:20:49.539
The divine Power is the ocean of knowledge,
is the ocean of love, joy and bliss, but above

01:20:56.209 --> 01:21:03.209
all it is the ocean of forgiveness. So whatever
mistakes you have committed can be easily

01:21:03.999 --> 01:21:10.719
dissolved by the power of this ocean of forgiveness.
So please forgive yourself and raise your

01:21:10.719 --> 01:21:17.719
right hand in the corner of your neck and
your shoulder, and turn your head to your

01:21:19.300 --> 01:21:26.300
right. Here with full confidence say sixteen
times, “Mother, I am not guilty at all.”

01:21:34.630 --> 01:21:41.630
Please say that, “Mother, I am not guilty
at all.”

01:21:56.119 --> 01:22:02.939
I have already told you, whether you forgive
or don’t forgive you don’t do anything,

01:22:02.939 --> 01:22:09.939
but if you don’t forgive then you play into
wrong hands. It’s a myth to know that you

01:22:11.130 --> 01:22:18.130
are not forgiving someone. It’s a myth.
So please raise your right hand on your forehead

01:22:23.619 --> 01:22:30.619
across, and please put down your head as far
as possible. And here with full confidence

01:22:34.869 --> 01:22:40.309
you have to say from your heart – not how
many times, from your heart – please say,

01:22:40.309 --> 01:22:47.309
it is very important, “Mother, I forgive
everyone.” Don’t say “I try” – just

01:22:48.070 --> 01:22:55.070
saying it, with full confidence, “Mother,
I forgive everyone in general.”

01:23:04.639 --> 01:23:11.639
Now, take back your hand on the back side
of your head. Push back your head as far as

01:23:19.070 --> 01:23:26.070
possible. Here we have to say, without feeling
guilty, without counting your mistakes; just

01:23:36.559 --> 01:23:43.559
for your satisfaction, from your heart, not
how many times, “Oh divine Power, if I have

01:23:45.570 --> 01:23:52.570
done any mistakes knowingly or unknowingly,
please forgive me.”

01:24:18.030 --> 01:24:25.030
Now stretch your right hand. Put the center
of your palm on the fontanel bone area which

01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:38.280
was a soft bone in your childhood. Now put
down your head as far as possible, put down.

01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:45.360
Push back your fingers. Here again I respect
your freedom. I cannot force Self-realization

01:24:51.039 --> 01:24:57.829
on you – you have to ask for it. So now
push back your fingers with the pressure;

01:24:57.829 --> 01:25:04.829
move your scalp seven times clockwise, saying
seven times, “Mother, please give me Self-realization.”

01:25:17.439 --> 01:25:24.439
[Shri Mataji blows into the microphone seven
times.]

01:25:51.070 --> 01:25:58.070
Now please take down your hand. (If you can
close the air-conditioning, they would feel

01:26:14.059 --> 01:26:21.059
it better.) Now please put, open your eyes
and put both the hands towards Me like this,

01:26:26.269 --> 01:26:33.269
like this. Now, put your right hand like this,
and don’t think – you can manage, now

01:26:41.269 --> 01:26:47.989
you don’t think. Put the right hand and
put down your head, and see with the left

01:26:47.989 --> 01:26:52.630
hand if there is a cool breeze – can you
get up and show them? – if there’s a cool

01:26:52.630 --> 01:26:59.630
breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area.
Now, please put the left hand away from your

01:26:59.719 --> 01:27:06.719
head, not on top – away, not very far; some
people get it far also – but just try to

01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:14.280
feel if there’s a cool breeze coming out
of your head. Now please put your left hand

01:27:23.969 --> 01:27:30.969
towards Me like this, like this. And now put
down your head, and now see for yourself if

01:27:33.010 --> 01:27:40.010
there’s a cool breeze coming out of your
head. (There is so much of cool breeze.) Now

01:27:43.649 --> 01:27:50.649
feel it with the right hand. Right hand towards
Me and left hand: you see it clearly, if there’s

01:28:03.860 --> 01:28:08.639
a cool breeze coming out of your head, the
fontanel bone area. You can move your hand

01:28:08.639 --> 01:28:12.969
a little bit up and down and see for yourself
on sideways.

01:28:12.969 --> 01:28:19.969
Now, raise both your hands towards the sky.
Push back your head and ask a question, “Mother,

01:28:23.780 --> 01:28:30.780
is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”
or ask, “Mother is this the all-pervading

01:28:32.169 --> 01:28:39.169
Power of divine love?” or “Mother, is
this the Paramachaitanya?” Ask any one of

01:28:40.519 --> 01:28:47.519
these questions three times, raising your
hands.

01:28:47.849 --> 01:28:54.849
Put down your hands, please. So much of breeze
already blowing all over! All those … it’s

01:28:58.539 --> 01:29:05.539
tremendous breeze already blowing all over.
It’s not air-conditioning, for your information.

01:29:08.039 --> 01:29:15.039
Now those who have felt the cool breeze out
of their fontanel bone area or on their hands

01:29:15.559 --> 01:29:22.559
or fingertips, please raise both your hands.
May God bless you.

01:29:33.530 --> 01:29:39.360
So many of you have felt it now. Some of you
have not felt, doesn’t matter. Tomorrow

01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:46.360
again we have a program, and I’ll explain
to you more about the nature of spirit and

01:29:47.059 --> 01:29:53.860
the nature of these centers. Please inform
your friends, everyone, to come, and tomorrow

01:29:53.860 --> 01:30:00.860
hopefully, I will meet all of you one by one.
Also those who have problems should write

01:30:01.969 --> 01:30:08.969
them on a piece of paper and their address,
and we’ll try to contact them and help them

01:30:11.039 --> 01:30:17.320
as far as possible. Thank you very much.

01:30:17.320 --> 01:30:24.320
Those who have not felt can come on this side
and the Sahaja yogis can work it out in five

01:30:26.630 --> 01:30:31.139
minutes, those who have not felt. Because
you did not forgive; I know you have not forgiven.

01:30:31.139 --> 01:30:34.860
If you had forgiven you would have felt it.
Come along, this side. Just five minutes and

01:30:34.860 --> 01:30:41.860
they’ll give you realization. You felt it?
Ha, good. Your problems will be solved now,

01:30:44.189 --> 01:30:51.189
it’s good. You felt it? …. Which hand
you felt? Left you felt, not the right? …. Doesn’t

01:31:05.179 --> 01:31:12.179
matter. We’ll work it out. It’s good.
Surprising! …. First of all, see on their

01:31:22.380 --> 01:31:29.280
heads are you feeling it or not; just see
it. They might be saying they are not feeling

01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:34.559
it because of Vishuddhi. …. Yes, yes, do.

01:31:34.559 --> 01:31:41.559
[Seeker asks about her chronic low energy,
and the Hatha Yoga she has been doing.]

01:31:56.769 --> 01:32:03.769
You know, you see this modern Hatha Yoga is
most unscientific. It is just done like all

01:32:10.449 --> 01:32:15.519
the medicines you take from the medicine box,
without knowing what you need really. So you

01:32:15.519 --> 01:32:20.449
give up that and come to Sahaja Yoga and know
what’s wrong with you, and fill yourself

01:32:20.449 --> 01:32:25.999
with energy, all right? Is all nonsense. It’s
all nonsense. It has given heart attacks to

01:32:25.999 --> 01:32:32.099
people, heart attacks. It’s the way they
go about it. We also do a little bit of Hatha

01:32:32.099 --> 01:32:35.709
Yoga, but wherever it is necessary; it’s
not like mad, doing all the time there. Now

01:32:35.709 --> 01:32:42.709
you have a catch on this one, you have a catch
on there. Two centers are very badly caught

01:32:43.590 --> 01:32:48.820
up. So you’d better come to Sahaja Yoga,
all right, and fix yourself up, because Hatha

01:32:48.820 --> 01:32:52.239
Yoga nobody reaches God, that’s true.

01:32:52.239 --> 01:32:56.729
But this Hatha Yoga is very limited: a wee
bit of it. You see, Patanjali wrote “Ashtanga

01:32:56.729 --> 01:33:03.729
Yoga” out of which this Hatha Yoga that
you do is one-eighth of one of them. And that

01:33:04.820 --> 01:33:09.610
to be is understood with the guidance of the
kundalini: where is the kundalini stopping?

01:33:09.610 --> 01:33:14.369
Whatever center it is stopping, that is the
one you have to look after. And that is the

01:33:14.369 --> 01:33:21.369
one you have to do that particular asana for
that particular thing – not all of them

01:33:21.399 --> 01:33:28.399
like that mad. All right? So …. You cannot
do it unless and until you start your kundalini.

01:33:28.939 --> 01:33:34.189
Once you start your kundalini, you will know
where the problem is. It’s like if your

01:33:34.189 --> 01:33:41.189
car has started then you will know where is
the problem is, isn’t it? It’s like that.

01:33:44.709 --> 01:33:50.249
May God bless you.

01:33:50.249 --> 01:33:57.249
So now, how are you? Your sister? You are
all right now? She’s in Iceland. You give

01:34:13.789 --> 01:34:20.789
her address to us, we’ll contact her. All
right. What is she, now? Iceland? …. What’s

01:34:39.429 --> 01:34:46.429
the matter with her? …. You see, they will
tell …. You come and see Me, and take the

01:35:26.610 --> 01:35:33.610
photograph .… And then you send My photograph,
and tell her to put both her hands towards

01:35:49.389 --> 01:35:56.389
the photograph and both her feet in

01:39:52.969 --> 01:39:59.969
the water with salt every night …. Both
the hands to the photograph, and both the

01:43:27.889 --> 01:43:34.889
feet in the water …. All right? But

01:53:08.889 --> 01:53:15.889
first you master this.

01:53:35.469 --> 01:53:42.469
You felt the cool breeze?

01:54:02.969 --> 01:54:09.969
[Seeker says he wasn’t sure if it was cool
or not.]

01:54:57.479 --> 01:55:04.479
Better forgive. You have to forgive …. you
don’t forgive. How can I forgive for you?

02:04:50.019 --> 02:04:57.019
You have to forgive yourself, forgive everyone.
I can’t forgive for you.

02:06:55.059 --> 02:07:02.059
[Seeker asks where Shri Mataji lives in India.]

02:07:51.399 --> 02:07:58.399
For practical purposes I live in London.
