00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.793
Very good. Excellent.

00:01:56.843 --> 00:01:59.843
They are very simple people and innocent.

00:01:59.868 --> 00:02:03.068
They don’t accept nonsense much.

00:02:25.496 --> 00:02:29.060
Interpreter:  There is an economic crisis
at this moment in Turkey.

00:02:29.085 --> 00:02:33.045
Can we overcome this crisis and
how can we overcome this crisis?

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.992
By the grace of God, everything
can be work out.

00:02:36.032 --> 00:02:39.338

in this country

00:02:39.363 --> 00:02:41.930

00:02:42.041 --> 00:02:48.779
It is most important thing that you have
to become very peaceful, joyous and happy.

00:03:10.988 --> 00:03:16.842
Interpreter: Minister who is responsible
from the finance of Turkey,

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.790

00:03:20.602 --> 00:03:23.288
Kemal Dervish, his name is Kemal Dervish.

Yes yes, I have seen his photograph.

00:03:26.116 --> 00:03:28.586
He is nice man but very hard working.

00:03:28.611 --> 00:03:32.618
So, I think he should take little easy.

00:03:44.022 --> 00:03:49.854
Because you see, these hard works
can make your heart weak.

00:03:49.862 --> 00:03:54.002

It’s a most important thing.

00:04:51.555 --> 00:04:54.182
You don’t have to pay for it.
You don’t have to do anything.

00:04:54.207 --> 00:04:58.475
But you must respect yourself and
go deep down into yourself to know

00:04:58.483 --> 00:05:00.470
what are your values.

00:05:06.137 --> 00:05:07.684
It is miraculous.

00:05:11.579 --> 00:05:13.019
May God bless you.

“She is feels positive energy,

love  from you while talking”.

00:05:29.747 --> 00:05:32.096
That’s the way thing.
We have to Love.

00:05:32.144 --> 00:05:34.177
