00:00:18.085 --> 00:00:20.200
Interviewer: What is Sahaja Yoga?

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.940
Shri Mataji: Sahaja, 'saha'
means with, 'ja' means born.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.500
Born with you is sahaja.

00:00:26.786 --> 00:00:29.713
Yoga means union with the Divine, that is,

00:00:29.913 --> 00:00:33.772
spontaneous union with the Divine.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.203
Interviewer: And is it for all ages?

00:00:36.404 --> 00:00:38.580
Shri Mataji: Yes; for all ages; for everyone.

00:00:38.803 --> 00:00:41.900
It is an evolutionary process

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:48.020
which ends up with your ultimate goal,

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.653
and that is to become the Spirit.
And so it is meant for everyone.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.790
Interviewer: And how does it
differ from other forms of yoga?

00:00:56.991 --> 00:01:01.064
Shri Mataji: Other forms of
yogas are leading to this one

00:01:01.264 --> 00:01:06.417
so that you are purified to
receive this spontaneous yoga.

00:01:06.617 --> 00:01:09.220
But there is no need to do anywhere of these;

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.806
you can get your realisation
without doing anything, any one of them.

00:01:16.173 --> 00:01:18.645
Interviewer: What is Self-Realisation?

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.740
Shri Mataji: Self-Realisation
is that, so far the Spirit -

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.420
which is in your heart, which
is witnessing your activities,

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.860
but does not come into play, into your actions

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.220
nor into your intelligence,
nor into your attention -

00:01:39.474 --> 00:01:43.940
but once you get self-realised then the Spirit,

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.577
the light of the Spirit shines

00:01:46.777 --> 00:01:51.300
and that's how your whole
attitude towards life changes.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.203
You become a transformed personality.

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:57.798
Interviewer: Are You the only
person that can give Self-Realisation?

00:01:57.999 --> 00:02:03.432
Shri Mataji: No. There are many Sahaja Yogis 
who can give Self-Realisation to many people.

00:02:04.118 --> 00:02:07.500
Interviewer: Shri Mataji, it's written
in the publicity that I read that,

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.996
You can actually give Self-Realisation en masse.
Shri Mataji: Yes.

00:02:12.197 --> 00:02:14.264
Interviewer: Why is this possible?

00:02:14.774 --> 00:02:18.740
Shri Mataji: The time has come
for giving en masse realisation I think;

00:02:19.008 --> 00:02:21.494
I am making the best of it.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.676
Interviewer: And in what ways does one's 
life change once one has Self-Realisation?

00:02:27.896 --> 00:02:33.740
Shri Mataji: A Sahaja
Yogi is a person whose guideline is his Spirit.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.079
Thus he is standing at a point which is absolute.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.705
He is not relatively looking after his life;

00:02:43.906 --> 00:02:48.940
he is on an absolute point: means
whatever he does is the absolute truth.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.500
He doesn't take to anything that
is untruth, which is false, which is superficial.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.460
That's how he is absolutely
tranquil and peaceful and dynamic.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:05.596
And he has all the qualities of a very
good gentleman, like he is righteous,

00:03:06.336 --> 00:03:09.140
he is very pure

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.060
and also he is very virtuous.

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.300
We need people of that kind today,

00:03:18.573 --> 00:03:20.646
to make a new world.

00:03:21.066 --> 00:03:24.406
Interviewer: Do You think the 
world is in a very precarious situation?

00:03:24.607 --> 00:03:27.229
Shri Mataji: It is, very much.
You can see all around,

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.580
it is in a very precarious
way placed and this is the time when

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.460
one starts thinking of getting to
something better or to get out of it,

00:03:35.683 --> 00:03:38.683
and that's the time when it works out the best.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.216
Interviewer: And in what other 
countries is there Sahaja Yoga?

00:03:43.776 --> 00:03:50.015
Shri Mataji: It's a big list. There are about fourteen
to fifteen countries altogether, involved in Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:50.216 --> 00:03:53.700
And to name them, we can say U.K, France,

00:03:54.556 --> 00:03:56.243
Spain,

00:03:56.843 --> 00:03:58.500
Austria,

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.820
Australia, of course, is first.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.363
Then we have on the other side

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.100
is Switzerland, Germany.

00:04:09.683 --> 00:04:11.609
What else, America:

00:04:12.803 --> 00:04:16.436
about fifteen countries altogether. Algeria.

00:04:17.847 --> 00:04:22.010
Interviewer: Why are You called the Mother?
Shri Mataji: Mother.
Interviewer: Mother.

00:04:23.403 --> 00:04:27.097
Shri Mataji: Because I gave them the second birth.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.210
Interviewer: Well, that's a very simple answer.

00:04:31.411 --> 00:04:36.900
Shri Mataji: That's the answer. The one
who gives you the birth is the mother, isn't it?

00:04:38.003 --> 00:04:39.983
And that's how they call Me the Mother.

00:04:40.183 --> 00:04:43.083
But also, the mother's qualities are needed today.

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:48.077
The patience, the love,
the compassion, the understanding

00:04:48.416 --> 00:04:50.702
and also commanding

00:04:50.903 --> 00:04:55.460
the confidence of all the
children, is only in a mother.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.403
That's why it is better to be a mother.

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.110
Interviewer: And how
difficult do You think it is to live a life

00:05:02.663 --> 00:05:07.750
once you become, to live the life that's meant
to be, once you become involved with Sahaja Yoga?

00:05:07.951 --> 00:05:10.755
Shri Mataji: It is the
easiest life to lead because

00:05:10.956 --> 00:05:14.140
you then come across people who are very good.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.139
They are of the same type, a good rapport is there

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.300
- very great friendship, a big fraternity

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.300
and also you find life much more interesting that,

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.900
you do not think about them
but you enjoy everything.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.853
So the life is much easier after realisation.

00:05:31.053 --> 00:05:35.660
You become very dynamic, all your
problems get solved, your health improves.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.920
So in every way, it is such a great blessing.

00:05:40.798 --> 00:05:44.743
Interviewer: I don't have any more questions 
but is there anything else that You'd like to add?

00:05:44.944 --> 00:05:47.503
Shri Mataji: Yes. That now,

00:05:48.097 --> 00:05:53.740
we are standing at a point where evolution
has reached us to human awareness

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:56.620
and that is not absolute.

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:02.896
We have to jump to a higher
awareness and that is the Spirit

00:06:03.203 --> 00:06:05.620
and that, one has to be achieved by everyone.

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:11.180
Otherwise, there is no solution for all kinds
of problems people are facing today.

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:15.899
Thank you.
Interviewer: Thank You. Shri Mataji: Thank you.

00:06:21.223 --> 00:06:26.336
Shri Mataji: It has come all right?
Interviewer: I hope so. I'll just rewind a little bit.

00:06:28.308 --> 00:06:31.056
Yogini: Excuse me Shri Mataji,
would You like a cup of tea or coffee?

00:06:31.257 --> 00:06:34.243
Shri Mataji: I've had but let her have something.
Yogini: Would you like a cup of tea or coffee?

00:06:34.444 --> 00:06:36.579
Interviewer: I'll have some tea, thank you.

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:58.036
[they listen to playback of recording].

00:07:00.216 --> 00:07:05.463
Shri Mataji: There's one more 
thing I would like to say, is this...

00:07:06.383 --> 00:07:08.816
Interviewer: I've got to turn it on first.

00:07:10.983 --> 00:07:16.606
Shri Mataji: This is a living process; living
process of evolution for which you cannot pay.

00:07:16.953 --> 00:07:23.100
This is one thing people should understand that,
you cannot pay for anything that is spiritual.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:28.793
Anybody who collects the money in
the name of God is doing a wrong thing,

00:07:32.783 --> 00:07:37.740
so one has to be careful:
that you cannot pay for your evolution.

00:07:38.329 --> 00:07:41.826
Should be understood
logically and then you must act

00:07:42.027 --> 00:07:47.900
that don't trust people who ask
for money for anything that is spiritual.

00:07:52.586 --> 00:07:54.540
It's all right.

00:07:56.326 --> 00:07:58.326
Done well.

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:01.422
Very good questions.

00:08:01.623 --> 00:08:04.276
Interviewer: Thank You.
Shri Mataji: Straightforward. Yes.

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:25.886
Shri Mataji: I didn't give all the names
of all the countries. I don't know which I missed.

00:08:26.326 --> 00:08:28.333
Yogis: Belgium and Holland. India.

00:08:28.533 --> 00:08:32.260
Shri Mataji: Belgium and Holland.
And India. Of all the things! India!

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:34.820
Interviewer: I can put that in the introduction.

00:08:37.806 --> 00:08:41.133
I can say that there are so many countries.

00:08:41.333 --> 00:08:45.780
Shri Mataji: Yes, that you can say. You see, after
all, missing India is all right. Doesn't matter.

00:08:48.433 --> 00:08:51.060
[aside: He doesn't eat sweet, much.]

00:09:19.536 --> 00:09:23.860
What radio is this?
Interviewer: It's Radio 2SER FM

00:09:24.293 --> 00:09:27.580
and tonight, what I'll do
is I'll take it and I'll edit it

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:31.566
and I'll put it on to reel to reel and prepare
it, so that they can broadcast it tomorrow.

00:09:31.767 --> 00:09:34.780
Shri Mataji: Tomorrow.
Interviewer: Between ten and twelve,

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:37.020
because the public program is tomorrow night

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:39.539
and Friday night, so it had 
to go to air tomorrow morning.

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:41.660
Shri Mataji: Yes. Tomorrow is the program, isn't?

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:43.800
Yogis: Yes, yes.
Shri Mataji: Tomorrow night?

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.020
Yogis: Tomorrow night at 7:30.
Shri Mataji: Before that, if it is,

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:51.060
I think but also
- you must also give that place...

00:09:51.261 --> 00:09:53.180
Interviewer: Yes. I'll do that.
Shri Mataji: That she will do.

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:56.060
Interviewer: In the conclusion, I will say...
Shri Mataji: Yes, you can say

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.533
this is the place where we are having it.

00:09:59.206 --> 00:10:01.839
Because otherwise, they'll
telephone to you one after another.

00:10:02.039 --> 00:10:04.620
Interviewer: Yes, and ask where it is.
Yeah, we'll do that.

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:09.936
And anything that wasn't covered in that, I can
actually cover in the introduction or the conclusion.

00:10:10.137 --> 00:10:12.403
Shri Mataji: No, it's all right,
I think it's very straightforward.

00:10:12.603 --> 00:10:15.660
See, for common people,
when they're listening to any radio,

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:20.140
they don't want to hear a big
sort of a philosophical treaties.

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:24.537
They are very happy with
small little crisp answers

00:10:24.738 --> 00:10:26.740
which goes into their heads very easily,

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:31.603
and then their curiosity is there, so they
come to the program. That's much better.

00:10:50.145 --> 00:10:53.426
Sydney, there people are
much more receptive, aren't they?

00:10:57.105 --> 00:11:01.517
Even there, that gentleman was all right,
but so anxious to get his realisation

00:11:01.718 --> 00:11:05.220
and he was in a big hurry, you see. His Kundalini,

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:10.660
Kundalini was rising but he couldn't feel it. It used
to go back to his Vishuddhi, go back to his Nabhi.

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:14.030
I didn't know what to do with it. Poor fellow.

00:11:19.302 --> 00:11:23.256
Sahaja Yogi: There's been a
big difference Mother, since Sunday.

00:11:23.949 --> 00:11:29.340
I came back early and I've been
talking to the press since Sunday,

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:34.390
and people who were not very
interested before are now interested.

00:11:35.329 --> 00:11:38.140
Sahaja Yogi 2: The changes are starting already.

00:11:40.595 --> 00:11:43.220
Shri Mataji: Yes, the atmosphere
changes, everything changes.

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:46.162
Indian Sahaja Yogi:
I was trying to contact Aurangabad.

00:11:48.021 --> 00:11:54.300
The lady who was trying to contact us,
but presumed my intonation different.

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:59.220
Said that 'Are you an Australian?'
I said, 'No, I am from India.'

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:04.060
She said, 'You have come
recently?' I said, 'Only this morning.'

00:12:05.743 --> 00:12:10.540
'Where are you staying?' I said, 'I am
staying in an ashram, a Sahaja Yogi ashram.'

00:12:13.233 --> 00:12:17.006
'What is this ashram?'
I said, 'My sister is Mataji,

00:12:17.553 --> 00:12:23.220
and She has founded this Sahaja Yoga
ashram and people belong to Sahaja Yoga.'

00:12:23.946 --> 00:12:27.060
She said, 'Is it Nirmala Devi Mataji?'

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:31.410
I said, 'Yes, but how do you know?' She
said, 'We have been reading in papers.'

00:12:32.625 --> 00:12:34.358
Shri Mataji: Who are they?

00:12:34.559 --> 00:12:39.180
Indian Sahaja Yogi: The local telephone operator.

00:12:46.673 --> 00:12:49.860
I was really surprised.
Sahaja Yogi: So was I!

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:53.826
Indian Sahaja Yogi: Yes, yes, you were there.

00:12:55.296 --> 00:12:59.340
Shri Mataji: No, if the media wants,
you know. Actually it is en masse

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:02.980
and also there was never
a media like this, you see.

00:13:03.326 --> 00:13:06.280
If the media wants, they can 
help the whole world, isn't it?

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.540
Interviewer: That's true. 
Shri Mataji: Isn't it?

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:11.020
They have to give the truth to the 
people, but if they do not want to do it

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:13.900
- I mean they are the ones 
who will be held responsible.

00:13:17.288 --> 00:13:22.380
Indian Sahaja Yogi: The media is divided in
two parts: one who gives real, truthful accounts,

00:13:22.689 --> 00:13:25.096
the other which it does not.

00:13:26.016 --> 00:13:32.220
Shri Mataji: Another thing is also that, you
see when they become sort of doubtful about it,

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:34.580
they say: 'First give us the realisation

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:43.300
and then we will do it,' which is very difficult.
Sometimes you can't give them, so it's being very selfish.

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:46.005
I mean, if I can't give realisation to someone,

00:13:46.206 --> 00:13:49.673
that doesn't mean that there 
isn't something like that.

00:13:53.736 --> 00:13:57.223
But in Italy, when I went there, 
there was a fellow called Romano.

00:13:57.423 --> 00:14:01.300
He's a big fan
of people, a very interesting person.

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:05.140
He said, 'Mother, I must ask 
You one thing.' I said, 'What?',

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:07.569
'Please give me realisation.'

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:10.500
I said, 'I have to broadcast.'

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:13.540
He said, 'First give me 
realisation; it will be a good idea.'

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:19.860
So I gave him the realisation and he laughed
and, 'Ah, so the joke is over. The joke is over.'

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:23.906
I said, 'What about our program?' 
He said, 'No, we'll have the program.'

00:14:24.413 --> 00:14:27.200
Then we went to one place and he said,

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.900
'These are all monkeys here, 
they can't understand Sahaja Yoga.'

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:34.300
I said, 'Why?' He said, 'They won't 
understand any Sahaja Yoga, Mother.

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.540
You just don't talk to them.' I said, 'All right.'

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:43.380
But then he gave Me such a big publicity
in Milano, and then we went to a hill station.

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:46.460
He gathered about six to 
seven hundred people there

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:50.500
and gave Me such a big publicity, 
you can't imagine, the Romano fellow.

00:14:51.053 --> 00:14:53.053
Wonderful person.

00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:03.140
Sahaja Yogi: It's very different
this time, Mother. Last time, Your last visit,

00:15:03.803 --> 00:15:08.042
the people on the press who 
were interested, were sensational,

00:15:08.243 --> 00:15:13.060
they wanted something clever, some big trick.

00:15:13.396 --> 00:15:17.260
This time, the same people are not interested.

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:24.220
This time they, the people who are showing
interest are receptive to the message.

00:15:24.623 --> 00:15:27.900
It's quite remarkable. It's 
happening down in Melbourne too.

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:31.060
All the sensationalists are not interested.

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:34.996
So hopefully, we'll get a very 
good coverage, this time.

00:15:35.816 --> 00:15:39.700
Shri Mataji: You see, this sensation
business also comes from materialism, I think.

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:42.460
That man, he - human beings are becoming matter,

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:47.820
so they need some sensations in 
their body to come up to something.

00:15:49.203 --> 00:15:53.180
They can't see something very 
obvious and good for them.

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:56.597
They need some sensation. 
Like this gentleman asked Me,

00:15:56.797 --> 00:15:59.180
'We have to go outside on the street.'

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:02.860
I said, 'Street it won't work out because, 
you see this is a serious subject.

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:07.740
How can I discuss with you on the street,
you see?' So he compromised on a garden.

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:11.420
We went to the garden and all 
the clouds started going there.

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:17.860
Then he said, 'All right, now that's 
over, now we'll start the whole thing.'

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:22.073
And then it started raining, 
after that he gave up.

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:31.016
Sahaja Yogi: Started raining just as
we were trying to give him realisation.

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:33.610
Heavens were warning us.

00:16:40.283 --> 00:16:43.303
Shri Mataji: You see, there 
are people who are thinking,

00:16:43.503 --> 00:16:46.603
who are worried, who want to do something great.

00:16:46.803 --> 00:16:51.140
But we have to approach them somehow
with this; approach is to be built up.

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:53.703
Once that is built up there is no problem.

00:16:53.903 --> 00:16:55.980
But that's the main thing is.

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:58.708
The right type of people we should meet.

00:16:58.909 --> 00:17:02.220
Like, first time I went to Italy,

00:17:02.502 --> 00:17:06.650
we had informed the newspaper to advertise

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:11.460
and I stayed in a hotel: one girl was with Me.

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:18.740
Nobody contacted us. Nobody came in the
hall. Not even a single soul. Nothing worked out.

00:17:19.043 --> 00:17:21.740
So we went back, spending all that money.

00:17:22.013 --> 00:17:26.780
And now in Italy, you can 
imagine, at the airport, if you go,

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:31.340
the whole of the airport is nothing 
but Sahaja Yogis. It happens like that.

00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:37.373
Same with our Calcutta. First time when I went to
Calcutta, there was one person in the hall, one person.

00:17:37.646 --> 00:17:40.020
And this time when I went there,

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:45.140
their biggest hall they have was given to us

00:17:45.406 --> 00:17:49.300
and the crowds was so much, 
they were all saying' Ma, Ma'

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:52.180
and nobody could come inside 
because the hall was all full,

00:17:53.126 --> 00:17:56.420
and thousands and thousands were waiting outside.

00:17:56.673 --> 00:17:59.079
And now it has taken such a form,

00:17:59.279 --> 00:18:05.060
that even the cinema actors went there
to collect money for our school in Calcutta.

00:18:07.481 --> 00:18:09.723
I mean, you can't believe the same Calcutta

00:18:09.924 --> 00:18:14.091
where there was only one 
single soul sitting in a big hall

00:18:15.296 --> 00:18:19.340
and I thought this fellow
also will run away after five minutes.

00:18:27.817 --> 00:18:30.260
It does change gradually.

00:18:30.496 --> 00:18:36.523
But one should not be shocked with
the first appearances, you see. It's all..

00:18:58.274 --> 00:19:01.731
Sahaja Yogi: [to Interviewer] Is that all
for the interviewing? Interviewer: Yes.

00:19:04.083 --> 00:19:06.860
Shri Mataji: All right, thank you very much. 
Interviewer: Thank You.

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:10.060
Shri Mataji: May God bless you.
Thank you very much.
