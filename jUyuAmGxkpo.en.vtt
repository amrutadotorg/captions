WEBVTT

00:13.360 --> 00:25.539

00:25.539 --> 00:42.760
whole may different chakras can be way

00:37.980 --> 00:47.460
these pronunciations are being used in

00:42.760 --> 00:52.119
the phonetic language of Devanagari

00:47.460 --> 01:00.570
which means the language spoken by the

00:52.119 --> 01:00.570
Devas with the man Hera

01:22.740 --> 01:27.570
sure and sir

01:28.340 --> 01:40.429
sounds are very close but the difference

01:35.210 --> 01:40.429
is when the snake

01:42.060 --> 01:52.760
this is it makes this show the third

01:49.760 --> 01:52.760
song

01:56.009 --> 02:03.020

02:28.810 --> 02:31.739
sounds

02:41.040 --> 02:51.109
ma ma ma ma ma

02:56.740 --> 02:59.939
[Music]

03:01.069 --> 03:21.340
Marie poo it has ten petals it makes the

03:07.280 --> 03:21.340
sound duh-duh-duh go

03:30.800 --> 03:46.750
at Anahata near Akron petals

Mugen to her - and we should be where

04:04.210 --> 04:10.300
they're 16

04:12.130 --> 04:18.330
but roots it makes

04:19.320 --> 04:28.760
the sounds of all the bubbles in E

04:32.570 --> 04:40.370
meaning me new a I

04:56.330 --> 05:03.729
and the agya chakra it makes well sure

05:05.590 --> 05:08.970
at the salon

05:10.129 --> 05:15.939
one becomes thoughtless I know

05:17.810 --> 05:28.870
some is made but the pure Anna Hutton

05:23.290 --> 05:36.640
meaning the trouble from the purest form

05:28.870 --> 05:36.640
and in the heart is locked up not top

05:38.310 --> 05:44.930
[Music]

05:41.220 --> 05:44.930
when all these sounds

05:45.639 --> 05:55.620
our sounded together and pass through in

05:52.990 --> 05:55.620
spiral

05:58.830 --> 06:07.139
off the body mr. Boddy is with account

06:11.340 --> 06:14.150
the song

06:16.780 --> 06:37.290
that comes out of the synthesis is like

06:31.210 --> 06:47.130
the seven colours of the Sun ultimately

06:37.290 --> 06:53.590
with non-white ways what you can say the

06:47.130 --> 06:56.410
golden colored race now the sound of

06:53.590 --> 06:59.770
Kundalini I have told you in one of my

06:56.410 --> 07:01.300
lectures how it creates up but exactly

06:59.770 --> 07:09.570
like we should be it creates the sound

07:01.300 --> 07:27.070
of all these levels that are in English

07:09.570 --> 07:32.560
so it languages these are the sound she

07:27.070 --> 07:40.260
creates out on all the chakras but when

07:32.560 --> 07:43.260
she comes to nothing it becomes a one is

07:40.260 --> 07:43.260
information

07:43.610 --> 07:52.750
provide information that's the munich

07:48.340 --> 07:55.990
coded information versatility per hour

07:52.750 --> 07:58.819
which you don't share when heat rises

07:55.990 --> 08:03.530
from the kundalini point miss mooladhara

07:58.819 --> 08:07.909
chakra i munathara well it is not good

08:03.530 --> 08:14.780
there's no Sun when it comes to the

08:07.909 --> 08:19.520
stomach the parabolic starts when it

08:14.780 --> 08:22.099
comes into the center right in the heart

08:19.520 --> 08:29.810
always you hear it madam on where you

08:22.099 --> 08:34.130
can hear it just like hot properly with

08:29.810 --> 08:37.310
the stethoscope you can hear it when it

08:34.130 --> 08:41.950
comes to should be it becomes a witness

08:37.310 --> 08:41.950
means patiently the one who seems like

08:42.039 --> 08:49.190
I've noticed yourself and you are caught

08:44.269 --> 08:55.519
up initially you need them that's where

08:49.190 --> 09:00.829
she sees then they sound which is round

08:55.519 --> 09:04.220
with with which you speak when it comes

09:00.829 --> 09:08.480
to the throat it becomes like hurry this

09:04.220 --> 09:11.690
is this is even before the Kundalini is

09:08.480 --> 09:14.420
there one the coded information the

09:11.690 --> 09:16.910
language which is first only coded

09:14.420 --> 09:20.269
becomes decoded here it's called vital

09:16.910 --> 09:24.320
it stops but after realization the

09:20.269 --> 09:27.500
Kundalini enlightens to man as it is

09:24.320 --> 09:31.670
unlike insulting because of that

09:27.500 --> 09:36.019
enlightenment your mantras become

09:31.670 --> 09:43.000
enlightened and that's how when you say

09:36.019 --> 09:46.810
a mantra it is effective it's light

09:43.000 --> 09:51.390
before this any mantra set has many it's

09:46.810 --> 09:54.670
just ordinary one just like any ordinary

09:51.390 --> 09:58.960
so it is called as peanut nap which is

09:54.670 --> 10:01.450
jobless awakened so a mantra which is

09:58.960 --> 10:09.100
jog root they are not we created out of

10:01.450 --> 10:12.250
a mantra which is not enlightened like

10:09.100 --> 10:14.110
if you have say it or then pot or an are

10:12.250 --> 10:17.340
done things like this or this one as it

10:14.110 --> 10:20.860
is and you have all the oil and

10:17.340 --> 10:25.600
everything there so this one give life

10:20.860 --> 10:28.180
till it is enlightened the same where

10:25.600 --> 10:31.810
the mantra is nothing this let it get

10:28.180 --> 10:34.060
there unless an eclipse is enlightened

10:31.810 --> 10:37.990
by Kundalini it is not already very

10:34.060 --> 10:40.300
runny which cannot give you enlightened

10:37.990 --> 10:41.860
and which there aren't even lighten went

10:40.300 --> 10:47.560
to the mantras and that's why these

10:41.860 --> 10:55.450
mantras have known a person whose spirit

10:47.560 --> 11:00.010
is enlightened and his money is

10:55.450 --> 11:05.250
enlightened such a person whatever he

11:00.010 --> 11:10.230
says comes true whatever you ask for

11:05.250 --> 11:13.810
even before he say something the desire

11:10.230 --> 11:17.490
the desire within us which is the

11:13.810 --> 11:20.170
Ferrari which is the coded information

11:17.490 --> 11:22.780
of the desire you have it comes

11:20.170 --> 11:24.310
enlightened and that's how you get the

11:22.780 --> 11:28.030
result suddenly you get something you

11:24.310 --> 11:33.700
said oh I have struck me and mother has

11:28.030 --> 11:43.270
done it that's how the whole system

11:33.700 --> 11:46.000
works out this way of its purity without

11:43.270 --> 11:50.500
the purity we cannot see anything that

11:46.000 --> 11:53.860
is impure say say my hands are not clean

11:50.500 --> 11:55.880
I can't see the larvae anything that is

11:53.860 --> 11:59.600
dirty you cannot see the real kitchen

11:55.880 --> 12:01.700
you cannot see the reality if you not

11:59.600 --> 12:03.860
beautiful but even if it is

12:01.700 --> 12:08.510
superficially purified or artificially

12:03.860 --> 12:10.610
painted still you can always say that it

12:08.510 --> 12:13.250
is artificially painted and you cannot

12:10.610 --> 12:17.720
see the beauty of this one because this

12:13.250 --> 12:20.330
is done from outside but Kundalini burns

12:17.720 --> 12:25.580
often that's the salt makes everything

12:20.330 --> 12:29.380
into ashes and whatever remains is the

12:25.580 --> 12:29.380
pure gold of the Spirit

12:37.880 --> 12:39.940
you
