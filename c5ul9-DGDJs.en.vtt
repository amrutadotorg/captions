00:00:09.292 --> 00:00:13.292
This time when - there was no rain, so we went to the sea

00:00:13.542 --> 00:00:15.000
in Melbourne.

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:17.626
I told that would be great if we go to Melbourne,

00:00:17.834 --> 00:00:20.709
and we went to the sea and

00:00:20.918 --> 00:00:24.292
I made a Ganesha and they made a Shiva there

00:00:24.542 --> 00:00:29.167
and they worshipped Me.

00:00:32.876 --> 00:00:35.792
Do we have some towel for Mother?

00:00:36.292 --> 00:00:38.959
For Mother’s hands.

00:00:39.501 --> 00:00:43.792
So, and they made a

00:00:50.334 --> 00:00:53.167
Kundalini also there. See, and then they prayed.

00:00:53.375 --> 00:00:55.667
And it rained and rained and rained,

00:00:55.876 --> 00:00:59.959
it poured, you know, poured in buckets, poured in buckets, it was -

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:02.751
- I have never seen such rain before,

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:04.918
like buckets were pouring.

00:01:05.125 --> 00:01:06.501
And in one day,

00:01:06.709 --> 00:01:09.667
four inches of rain in that Sydney can you believe it?

00:01:09.918 --> 00:01:14.209
And the puja was on inside and outside on My birthday.

00:01:14.542 --> 00:01:17.209
Buckets and buckets of water.

00:01:17.417 --> 00:01:20.000
And it was a drought, you know,they were so frightened.

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:22.834
Yogi: We heard that the whole tent fell, Mother,

00:01:23.042 --> 00:01:26.375
because of so much rain. Robert was telling us, Mother.

00:01:26.667 --> 00:01:29.125
Shri Mataji: And the, you see the

00:01:29.334 --> 00:01:31.501
Sahaja Yogis enjoyed it so much,

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:33.042
how they are playing the trick.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.417
And then the river got flooded

00:01:35.626 --> 00:01:40.083
and it entered into all the pubs and all

00:01:40.334 --> 00:01:42.459
and washed off everything, you know, brought it,

00:01:42.667 --> 00:01:46.792
you see, as if went inside, washed the bottles, everything,

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:48.626
and all the bottles were,

00:01:48.834 --> 00:01:51.834
some of the empty ones you see, were floating,

00:01:52.042 --> 00:01:53.626
these plastic ones were floating

00:01:53.834 --> 00:01:55.125
and others sank down.

00:01:55.334 --> 00:01:57.459
And everything was washed up and was brought in.

00:01:57.667 --> 00:02:00.584
But only into the pubs there entered.

00:02:00.792 --> 00:02:04.209
So in the newspaper was that the rain

00:02:04.417 --> 00:02:07.667
was tremendous, but the river was very discrete.

00:02:10.334 --> 00:02:15.417
And also this fire that broke out before I went to Adelaide.

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.417
Adelaide had a very bad fire

00:02:19.626 --> 00:02:21.626
and what they described it was this -

00:02:21.834 --> 00:02:24.751
Can you put it there, this one, on top of that, like that?

00:02:25.501 --> 00:02:28.751
And they described that the fire

00:02:29.042 --> 00:02:32.209
was also very discrete

00:02:32.417 --> 00:02:36.542
and the balls of fire they saw rising on the hills

00:02:36.751 --> 00:02:40.167
and entering to some houses, avoiding some houses.

00:02:40.375 --> 00:02:43.459
Some houses were completely burned and some were not.

00:02:43.667 --> 00:02:47.209
And those people who did not suffer, came to My program said,

00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:51.042
"Now we know, why we are saved out of that."

00:02:51.334 --> 00:02:54.209
And they could see the balls, can you imagine the balls of fire

00:02:54.417 --> 00:02:57.250
from somewhere, I mean they don’t know how the balls were formed.

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.792
And big, big balls like this, you see, were just rolling up the hill.

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.209
And they could see, you see, balls rolling up the hill,

00:03:05.417 --> 00:03:08.959
they are going up, entering into the houses like that.

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.542
They just couldn’t understand what happened with the fire.

00:03:12.834 --> 00:03:16.334
But the best was the washing of the pubs,

00:03:16.542 --> 00:03:20.959
because normally on the riverside they have all these pubs, you see.

00:03:21.542 --> 00:03:26.542
And they washed up all these - what you call things used for,

00:03:26.751 --> 00:03:31.417
these tanning things, you see, they have those mattresses.

00:03:31.626 --> 00:03:34.459
Sahaja Yogi: Those sun lounges.
Shri Mataji: Sun mattresses and all that.

00:03:34.667 --> 00:03:39.542
All, everything was washed and brought inside.

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.375
I really enjoyed it very much.

00:03:42.584 --> 00:03:46.209
And Sahaja Yogis were so happy with all that, very happy

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.918
They asked Me a question: “Why God is angry with us, you see,

00:03:55.125 --> 00:03:56.542
here in Adelaide?”

00:03:56.751 --> 00:04:00.792
And Adelaide is just like Paris for Australia,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.417
just like Paris.

00:04:02.626 --> 00:04:05.918
Very promiscuous, all kinds of dirty things happen there,

00:04:06.125 --> 00:04:09.125
all sorts of horrid things take place there.

00:04:09.334 --> 00:04:12.250
So like Soho it is, you see?

00:04:13.125 --> 00:04:17.292
So it was Adelaide was chosen by fire - just burnt them out

00:04:17.501 --> 00:04:23.626
So when I went to see the things, you see, where it had started: All black,

00:04:23.876 --> 00:04:26.459
– all black things, nothing was there, nothing!

00:04:26.709 --> 00:04:29.709
No leaves, not a single leave there.

00:04:29.918 --> 00:04:31.959
And really it was surprising:

00:04:32.292 --> 00:04:33.959
This house was burned, that was not burned,

00:04:34.167 --> 00:04:35.959
this house was burned, that was not burned.

00:04:36.167 --> 00:04:37.542
You could see it so clearly.

00:04:37.751 --> 00:04:42.209
And where it was burned, it was burned completely!

00:04:42.667 --> 00:04:46.334
I don't know how they burned even the bricks and everything, you see!

00:04:46.542 --> 00:04:49.501
absolutely charred black.

00:04:52.209 --> 00:04:53.542
It’s very interesting the way

00:04:53.751 --> 00:04:56.876
sometimes the nature takes its respite.

00:04:57.834 --> 00:05:00.250
Like when I went once to Guntur, you see,

00:05:00.459 --> 00:05:04.083
I told these people that "You shouldn’t grow any tobaccos any more."

00:05:04.501 --> 00:05:09.834
They were exporting all that tobacco to England, can you imagine?

00:05:10.959 --> 00:05:14.709
And they had a- in the house you could find all your English tiles

00:05:14.918 --> 00:05:22.876
and English - what do you call these old style big showers, you see?

00:05:23.083 --> 00:05:24.459
such big, big showers, you see,

00:05:24.667 --> 00:05:27.083
you stand under them, then the whole thing

00:05:27.292 --> 00:05:30.417
that's absolutely - like a torrential rain falls on you. All English.

00:05:30.667 --> 00:05:33.876
And tubs they had, English tubs, everything in the house.

00:05:34.083 --> 00:05:36.209
Exporting that tobacco here you see.

00:05:36.417 --> 00:05:39.459
So I said, “You shouldn’t do that, you should not have done it!"

00:05:39.667 --> 00:05:41.417
So they said, “But you know, Mother,

00:05:41.626 --> 00:05:43.918
we are giving it to English, not to Indians.”

00:05:44.125 --> 00:05:47.334
I said, “Still you should not have done it, it’s wrong.” -

00:05:47.542 --> 00:05:51.501
I think you are doing the same mistake as I have done, I think. One moment.

00:05:51.709 --> 00:05:54.042
It's correct, it's correct.

00:05:54.375 --> 00:05:56.083
You are better (...)

00:05:56.292 --> 00:06:02.250
So, then what happened that,

00:06:02.626 --> 00:06:05.792
I told, just I told them you shouldn’t grow like this,

00:06:05.959 --> 00:06:06.834
it is not good.

00:06:07.042 --> 00:06:11.459
And whether they are English or Indian, you are committing sins.

00:06:11.667 --> 00:06:13.959
You should not do like that, why are you growing this?

00:06:14.167 --> 00:06:18.250
I said, you can grow very good –

00:06:18.792 --> 00:06:21.959
what you call? - cotton here, just like Egyptian cotton,

00:06:22.167 --> 00:06:23.459
I told them, why do you want to do it?

00:06:23.667 --> 00:06:27.000
Some people take Me seriously some of them got very angry.

00:06:27.209 --> 00:06:30.918
When I had gone there about 50 cars came to receive Me.

00:06:31.125 --> 00:06:34.626
So, when I was going hardly two or three people came to see Me because

00:06:34.834 --> 00:06:37.792
they were angry for that. I said now, I'd warned them,

00:06:37.959 --> 00:06:41.334
that if you go about like this the sea is just next door

00:06:41.542 --> 00:06:42.709
It will take a respite.

00:06:42.918 --> 00:06:45.542
It is going to be angry with you, listen to Me!

00:06:45.959 --> 00:06:48.000
And they were so angry with Me,

00:06:48.209 --> 00:06:51.000
they didn’t come to see Me off or anything, because I told them.

00:06:52.501 --> 00:06:54.959
Now what happened, that

00:06:55.918 --> 00:07:01.292
that same year there was a typhoon which entered into Guntur.

00:07:01.501 --> 00:07:03.209
It had never entered there

00:07:03.417 --> 00:07:06.167
and all that was devastated,

00:07:06.375 --> 00:07:09.751
all their crops were devastated.

00:07:10.209 --> 00:07:14.542
They can no more grow, no more grow tobacco there.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.042
And in the meanwhile the government of

00:07:21.959 --> 00:07:27.584
UK stopped the import of tobacco from that place.

00:07:27.792 --> 00:07:31.125
So it was doubly hit, you see, doubly hit.

00:07:31.334 --> 00:07:34.792
But those who started growing the cotton

00:07:34.959 --> 00:07:37.209
were perfectly all right.

00:07:37.751 --> 00:07:41.209
Because all this salty water went into the soil,

00:07:41.417 --> 00:07:42.792
so now they can’t grow all these things.

00:07:42.959 --> 00:07:46.250
And they said, they never had this kind of an experience.

00:07:46.459 --> 00:07:49.000
After that they came to Delhi and asked Me,

00:07:49.209 --> 00:07:50.959
"Mother, You must again come here,

00:07:51.167 --> 00:07:52.501
We are sorry for what we have done.”

00:07:52.709 --> 00:07:55.751
And I said, "Now you see, I didn't do anything, to be very frank”,

00:07:55.959 --> 00:07:58.792
I'd never thought of any destruction, but you brought it-

00:07:58.959 --> 00:08:01.417
but I told you, that the sea would get angry.

00:08:01.626 --> 00:08:04.292
But they said: “It happened so quickly, Mother.”

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:07.667
I said: "Not so quick, because

00:08:07.876 --> 00:08:12.667
at least there were eight months for Me to change your ways.

00:08:12.876 --> 00:08:15.584
Imagine, just to export those tobaccos to you

00:08:15.792 --> 00:08:19.125
and get those tubs there.

00:08:19.417 --> 00:08:22.792
You know they have a kind of a

00:08:23.709 --> 00:08:26.417
inferiority complex that

00:08:26.626 --> 00:08:29.918
if they live like English having tubs and things like that

00:08:30.125 --> 00:08:33.751
then they become something higher personality.

00:08:33.959 --> 00:08:37.626
But for that they sell tobacco to English, just imagine!

00:08:41.375 --> 00:08:43.751
It’s all showing up now, you will see that

00:08:43.959 --> 00:08:46.209
everything that I say will be showing up.

00:08:46.417 --> 00:08:48.834
I was happy to learn that there has been an-

00:08:49.042 --> 00:08:51.417
a program about these horrible diseases,

00:08:51.626 --> 00:08:53.918
which are caused by this promiscuous life and all that.

00:08:54.125 --> 00:08:56.459
I am very happy. Let people learn now!

00:08:56.667 --> 00:08:58.542
They used to make fun of Me and say

00:08:58.751 --> 00:09:03.959
that I am Victorian, this, that. Now let them learn what it means.

00:09:05.834 --> 00:09:08.417
Now everybody is quite alert.

00:09:09.125 --> 00:09:13.459
In England, in, you were telling Me I think, she told Me

00:09:13.667 --> 00:09:16.292
that in England there are 10,000 people

00:09:16.542 --> 00:09:19.250
who are suffering from this disease! Can you believe it?

00:09:20.459 --> 00:09:26.626
10,000 people!

00:09:31.292 --> 00:09:37.417
And they used to call Me ‘Victorian’.

00:09:44.292 --> 00:09:47.876
Gavin has arrived? All right.

00:09:48.334 --> 00:09:52.459
Just I say that hundred years life we'll see.

00:09:53.209 --> 00:09:54.834
Come along.

00:09:55.709 --> 00:09:59.083
You also giving a puja thing, you know, here.

00:10:00.417 --> 00:10:03.250
It's all right. You can take that paper out.

00:10:03.459 --> 00:10:07.125
Now, I think we should spread some other cloth here,

00:10:07.334 --> 00:10:10.709
some sort of a

00:10:10.918 --> 00:10:14.209
old towel or something, or put one of the towels there.

00:10:14.417 --> 00:10:17.334
so that this proportion is kept clear.

00:10:18.125 --> 00:10:21.459
There are some more. Take the -

00:10:29.542 --> 00:10:30.459
take the milk.

00:10:30.667 --> 00:10:34.876
I didn’t give you a silver thali, isn’t it?

00:10:35.209 --> 00:10:38.250
I must have given it to some other center, I don't know.

00:10:40.042 --> 00:10:42.918
From that same shop where they were giving Me, you see,

00:10:43.125 --> 00:10:45.667
100% silver I bought, silver for different centers.

00:10:45.876 --> 00:10:50.167
I don't know who I gave one.

00:11:09.959 --> 00:11:14.167
So all of them are here? Has Jane come?

00:11:14.959 --> 00:11:22.042
Shri Mataji: Has she arrived? No?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, she is here Mother. Where she is.
Sahaja Yogi: She is outside.

00:11:22.375 --> 00:11:25.292
All right. Call all of them inside.

00:11:25.501 --> 00:11:27.834
You can move forward a little bit I think.

00:11:28.042 --> 00:11:33.918
But why not spread here something just to - this.
Sahaja Yogi: It’s just coming, Mother. Of course, it’s just coming.

00:11:34.125 --> 00:11:39.667
(Hindi)

00:11:52.417 --> 00:12:00.000
Did you see those lines, energy lines? Just imagine.

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:06.167
Sahaja Yogi: There’s so many of the zodiac signs found here.

00:12:06.709 --> 00:12:10.042
Shri Mataji: Zodiac lines?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, they found them by energy lines.

00:12:10.459 --> 00:12:13.417
These are energy lines take to the zodiac?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

00:12:13.626 --> 00:12:19.292
Shri Mataji: I didn’t know that. I thought.
Sahaja Yogi: That’s [unclear] and that’s one in this.

00:12:20.334 --> 00:12:23.334
So what are the zodiac signs? Which ones are they?

00:12:23.542 --> 00:12:27.626
Sahaja Yogi: All the twelve signs.
Shri Mataji: All twelve are there - in a circle?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

00:12:34.417 --> 00:12:37.584
And you discovered these by a magnet?

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:42.083
Sahaja Yogi: I think he's found a lot of it by dowsing.

00:12:42.709 --> 00:12:44.501
Shri Mataji: By dowsing?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, just with the…

00:12:46.709 --> 00:12:50.167
With that? Or they find it by magnet?

00:12:50.375 --> 00:12:53.209
Sahaja Yogi: Or they find it also by tracing the old lines of the boundaries.

00:12:54.459 --> 00:12:56.792
Shri Mataji: Boundaries of what?
Sahaja Yogi: The waterways

00:12:56.959 --> 00:13:01.501
and the boundaries between the current shears.
Shri Mataji: Is it?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

00:13:01.709 --> 00:13:04.959
Shri Mataji: But actually, you see, if you take a magnet

00:13:05.709 --> 00:13:10.375
it will dip at the point, you see. So, if you follow that dipping

00:13:10.584 --> 00:13:15.626
then it forms a line. That’s the best scientific method.

00:13:15.834 --> 00:13:19.292
Dowsing also the same thing, it's working with the magnet.

00:13:20.417 --> 00:13:22.167
and the magnet, when it -

00:13:23.959 --> 00:13:27.626
you see at certain points, the magnetic lines are strong.

00:13:27.834 --> 00:13:33.083
Thus magnetism is the essence of the Mother Earth, in expression.

00:13:33.792 --> 00:13:36.876
I mean the fragrance is, but the fragrance has

00:13:37.083 --> 00:13:40.209
the magnet in it. You see, fragrance comes out of magnet.

00:13:40.417 --> 00:13:44.125
Now this magnetism of the Mother Earth

00:13:44.709 --> 00:13:49.918
goes in lines. You see, it doesn't move in - eh -

00:13:50.125 --> 00:13:52.792
only at the fragrant point it moves all over.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.542
But otherwise it acts in lines.

00:13:56.751 --> 00:14:00.125
And these lines you can find out easily if you use a magnet,

00:14:00.334 --> 00:14:02.876
you see, a powerful magnet.

00:14:03.083 --> 00:14:05.292
Move that magnet on the Mother Earth, you see,

00:14:05.501 --> 00:14:08.334
you will find that will start dipping down.

00:14:08.542 --> 00:14:10.959
You see, you move it and now you find it's not dipping there,

00:14:11.167 --> 00:14:13.626
then you move that side and the line travels.

00:14:14.167 --> 00:14:15.584
It’s the easiest way because

00:14:15.792 --> 00:14:19.834
dowsing could be could be bhootish sometimes, could be.

00:14:26.959 --> 00:14:29.876
But are you sure it's done with dowsing - they are doing?

00:14:30.083 --> 00:14:34.751
Sahaja Yogi: No, I think they use a combination of different things.

00:14:39.959 --> 00:14:43.375
Certainly this, this one who had written the book had been.

00:14:43.626 --> 00:14:48.959
Shri Mataji: Using dowsing. Sahaja Yogi: Using dowsing as one of the methods.

00:14:49.292 --> 00:14:52.167
Shri Mataji: But dowsing can be challenged by science.

00:14:56.959 --> 00:15:00.459
Sahaja Yogi: And te one in Glastonbury, Mother, was done by an aerial photograph.

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:05.125
The one in Glastonbury was also discovered by an aerial photograph.

00:15:05.542 --> 00:15:08.667
Sahaja Yogi: See to the field boundaries, things like that.

00:15:08.876 --> 00:15:10.584
Shri Mataji: How? They did photographs, how?

00:15:10.792 --> 00:15:13.667
Sahaja Yogi: They can see that the boundaries of the field made a pattern,

00:15:13.876 --> 00:15:15.751
things like that.
Shri Mataji: Field?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

00:15:15.959 --> 00:15:19.459
It's only old boundaries between the kind of crops.
Shri Mataji: Old ones?

00:15:19.709 --> 00:15:25.501
Sahaja Yogi: Fields and roads and waters.

00:15:28.334 --> 00:15:31.876
Shri Mataji: Unconscious must be building up that way.

00:15:32.083 --> 00:15:36.042
And the old people that lived, were much more sensitive,

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:39.501
much more reactive to unconscious.

00:15:39.834 --> 00:15:41.167
They were not so artificial.

00:15:41.375 --> 00:15:45.334
But when we become artificial, what happens, we get covered up

00:15:45.626 --> 00:15:47.250
with so many barriers that we cannot -

00:15:47.459 --> 00:15:50.918
we are not sensitive to the dictates of the unconscious.

00:15:51.125 --> 00:15:54.209
And when you cannot feel the dictates of the unconscious, you see,

00:15:54.417 --> 00:15:56.959
you start having again deliberations as I call it.

00:15:57.334 --> 00:16:01.792
Deliberations take you out, you see, from that sensitivity.

00:16:01.959 --> 00:16:05.083
But if you are natural and a simple person,

00:16:05.292 --> 00:16:07.667
then you are quite sensitive to it.

00:16:09.626 --> 00:16:10.918
You are very sensitive.

00:16:11.209 --> 00:16:15.375
Can you can move forward? I think you come forward now.

00:16:15.751 --> 00:16:22.667
Just come forward.

00:16:30.959 --> 00:16:33.292
Come forward, you can.

00:16:33.501 --> 00:16:36.792
Esther you come. Actually new people should be in front,

00:16:36.959 --> 00:16:40.250
those who are from Brighton.

00:16:40.459 --> 00:16:41.626
Would be better, I think.

00:17:36.834 --> 00:17:38.042
Come forward.

00:17:39.125 --> 00:17:43.834
The Brighton should, Brighton people should come forward I would say as much as you can.

00:17:44.042 --> 00:17:46.918
Gavin, you come this side, I think would be much better.

00:17:47.167 --> 00:17:50.542
because you have [unclear]

00:18:08.667 --> 00:18:11.584
Come along, sit down, sit down, sit down!

00:18:13.501 --> 00:18:16.542
Is that dirty [unclear]. You can keep on it that side, I think.

00:18:24.751 --> 00:18:26.751
Who else is there?

00:18:43.542 --> 00:18:45.250
Is somebody still outside?

00:18:47.375 --> 00:18:48.667
Nick, if you can.

00:18:51.042 --> 00:18:55.125
So this, on the other side of Nick also some people can be seated.

00:18:58.209 --> 00:19:01.584
It’s a very nice sunny day today, isn’t it?

00:19:03.626 --> 00:19:06.042
Sahaja Yogi: Would You like this window open slightly, Mother?
Shri Mataji: I beg your pardon...

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:08.542
Sahaja Yogi: Would You like the window slightly open, Mother?

00:19:08.751 --> 00:19:11.542
Shri Mataji: As you please. I think that one if you open, it’s a better idea.

00:19:11.751 --> 00:19:13.918
Sahaja Yogi: It's open, Mother. Shri Mataji: It's open, it's o.k. so.

00:19:56.667 --> 00:20:00.667
Today is a great day to come to Brighton,

00:20:01.501 --> 00:20:07.167
because it’s the day of Buddha’s birthday.

00:20:07.459 --> 00:20:10.959
Today is Buddha's birthday, Lord Buddha's birthday.

00:20:13.083 --> 00:20:17.501
We all have heard about His birth

00:20:19.459 --> 00:20:23.334
and that His mother dreamt of an elephant,

00:20:23.542 --> 00:20:29.959
of a large white elephant before the birth of Buddha.

00:20:32.459 --> 00:20:35.834
And then it was predicted

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:40.125
that a child will be born in your family

00:20:40.751 --> 00:20:45.751
who will be either a great saint

00:20:46.501 --> 00:20:50.125
or a very great King,

00:20:50.334 --> 00:20:54.125
as in Sanskrit called ‘chakravarti' - means the one who

00:20:54.542 --> 00:20:58.709
is the ruler of the whole world.

00:21:01.542 --> 00:21:04.167
So the father got worried,

00:21:05.209 --> 00:21:12.209
and he thought he must get the son involved into the family life,

00:21:12.918 --> 00:21:14.709
into material life

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:19.709
and give Him all the pleasures of life.

00:21:19.959 --> 00:21:24.459
So he built a very special place for Him,

00:21:24.667 --> 00:21:27.375
a beautiful palace to live in.

00:21:28.375 --> 00:21:36.334
And where he got Him married to a girl called Yashodhara,

00:21:36.834 --> 00:21:38.959
was a very, very beautiful woman,

00:21:39.584 --> 00:21:41.918
gave HIm all the pleasures of life,

00:21:42.125 --> 00:21:49.918
everything that he could do to entice this boy away from asceticism.

00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:56.959
Also you know the story of His going

00:21:57.167 --> 00:22:03.667
one day on the road, how He found three types of people,

00:22:03.918 --> 00:22:10.167
and how He felt that ‘Why a person should become old?'

00:22:10.375 --> 00:22:13.959
‘Why should a person suffer in life?

00:22:14.417 --> 00:22:17.501
and ‘Why should people die?’.

00:22:17.709 --> 00:22:25.542
So all these three things put an enquiry into Himself

00:22:25.876 --> 00:22:29.584
and He started trying to understand

00:22:29.792 --> 00:22:32.959
why these things happen to human beings.

00:22:33.167 --> 00:22:35.542
With this the enquiry started.

00:22:35.792 --> 00:22:42.167
So He reached a point where

00:22:42.375 --> 00:22:49.501
He could not bear any more the comforts and the, all the attachments

00:22:49.709 --> 00:22:52.834
that were entangled around him by His father.

00:22:53.542 --> 00:22:56.584
He had a son whose name was Rahul;

00:22:56.792 --> 00:23:04.501
and He left the son and the wife in the search of the truth.

00:23:05.959 --> 00:23:12.542
Now, He started from a wrong end, I should say,

00:23:12.751 --> 00:23:15.876
for the search of the truth because

00:23:16.083 --> 00:23:20.292
He wanted to know, why there are miseries in the human beings.

00:23:20.501 --> 00:23:27.959
And so He started from collective towards the center.

00:23:28.292 --> 00:23:30.584
When we see miseries all around us,

00:23:30.792 --> 00:23:33.459
many people I have seen, they say: “What about others?

00:23:33.667 --> 00:23:35.501
Will everybody get realization?

00:23:35.709 --> 00:23:37.751
Will everybody will have this, you see?

00:23:37.959 --> 00:23:43.250
This comes from the wrong end I feel because

00:23:43.542 --> 00:23:48.584
first of all we must know, are we all right?

00:23:50.083 --> 00:23:53.959
Have we - are we perfect?

00:23:54.167 --> 00:23:57.000
Are we full of joy?

00:23:57.209 --> 00:24:02.959
Have we received the absolute knowledge?

00:24:03.167 --> 00:24:07.792
If you start from this point, it’s always better.

00:24:07.959 --> 00:24:11.083
Because He started from the wrong point,

00:24:11.292 --> 00:24:14.125
searching it from the collective

00:24:14.334 --> 00:24:16.667
to remove the miseries of the people

00:24:16.876 --> 00:24:20.125
He had to go in a very round about way.

00:24:20.667 --> 00:24:24.792
So He read all the books and Vedas and this,

00:24:24.959 --> 00:24:27.792
He went to big pundits,

00:24:27.959 --> 00:24:34.667
to all the great knowledgeable people to meet them,

00:24:35.125 --> 00:24:41.459
to ask them the answer, “Why there are these three things?”

00:24:41.959 --> 00:24:48.959
that is the ‘roga’, is the

00:24:50.959 --> 00:24:56.083
health or miserable physical body,

00:24:56.626 --> 00:25:01.792
then the death and the old age.

00:25:02.959 --> 00:25:05.751
He went and asked so many people

00:25:05.959 --> 00:25:10.042
And they said: “You have to die because your are born."

00:25:10.542 --> 00:25:13.834
And then they said that you have to

00:25:14.042 --> 00:25:19.125
become old because you are born like that

00:25:19.584 --> 00:25:21.876
and you have to suffer

00:25:22.209 --> 00:25:24.334
because you commit sins.

00:25:24.542 --> 00:25:27.459
He was not satisfied with this answer.

00:25:28.209 --> 00:25:32.542
So He went on searching and searching and searching.

00:25:32.876 --> 00:25:36.459
Then He got tired, absolutely fed up.

00:25:36.667 --> 00:25:42.792
Then He went to a place called Gaya, very near

00:25:42.959 --> 00:25:47.042
Patna it is, I've seen the place and the tree.

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:55.375
And He sat under a banyan tree where He slept off,

00:25:55.584 --> 00:25:59.459
because He got so tired of His seeking.

00:25:59.667 --> 00:26:02.709
And after the sleep He got up

00:26:02.959 --> 00:26:06.792
and suddenly He got His Realization.

00:26:06.959 --> 00:26:11.459
And He thought the whole drama is over.

00:26:11.667 --> 00:26:16.709
Now His Mother Herself was Adishakti, who gave Him the birth

00:26:16.918 --> 00:26:19.667
and She died just after the birth of the child.

00:26:19.876 --> 00:26:25.042
And He got His Realization.

00:26:25.417 --> 00:26:29.459
Now at that time when He got His Realization

00:26:29.667 --> 00:26:33.626
there was nobody to tell Him what it is,

00:26:33.834 --> 00:26:37.626
that what it means Realization is.

00:26:37.834 --> 00:26:39.000
Nobody to decode

00:26:39.209 --> 00:26:45.125
or talk about anything that was to be understood by Him.

00:26:45.417 --> 00:26:49.459
But because of His tremendous seeking

00:26:49.667 --> 00:26:54.209
and such ardent desire

00:26:54.626 --> 00:27:00.626
that the shuddha iccha, the Kundalini itself rose,

00:27:00.834 --> 00:27:02.876
but of course the Adishakti blessed Him

00:27:03.083 --> 00:27:07.083
and He got His Realization under the banyan tree.

00:27:10.083 --> 00:27:13.876
Now any incarnation, which came on this Earth

00:27:14.083 --> 00:27:19.834
had to 'samayachara' - according to the time,

00:27:20.375 --> 00:27:24.292
the need of the time had to act firstly,

00:27:24.542 --> 00:27:31.250
secondly the need of the

00:27:31.501 --> 00:27:34.125
incarnation to come on this earth

00:27:34.375 --> 00:27:38.751
was first created in the human beings.

00:27:38.959 --> 00:27:43.918
So supposing at a time when there was too much of ritualism,

00:27:44.125 --> 00:27:48.000
Brahmanism or priesthood

00:27:48.209 --> 00:27:52.834
and people were trying to take everything

00:27:53.042 --> 00:27:58.000
onto those artificial rituals and all that,

00:27:58.209 --> 00:28:05.375
an incarnation had to come on this earth to correct those ideas.

00:28:05.584 --> 00:28:09.876
Like Krishna came at a time when He said, “This is all leela",

00:28:10.083 --> 00:28:12.083
the puja and everything He canceled.

00:28:12.292 --> 00:28:14.584
Nothing doing, no puja nothing,

00:28:14.834 --> 00:28:18.250
you just have raas, enjoy yourself.

00:28:18.459 --> 00:28:20.501
It's all a joke going on, you see.

00:28:20.709 --> 00:28:26.417
So He brought that concept at that time in the awareness of people

00:28:26.626 --> 00:28:29.375
that the whole world is a leela,

00:28:29.584 --> 00:28:34.000
is a play of God's own whims.

00:28:34.209 --> 00:28:35.959
So you just enjoy it.

00:28:36.667 --> 00:28:42.959
And that's how He created this wonderful festival of Holi,

00:28:43.167 --> 00:28:44.876
which we had

00:28:45.083 --> 00:28:49.459
in Delhi. I don’t know- anyone of you was there for the Holi? No.

00:28:49.667 --> 00:28:50.417
You were there?

00:28:50.709 --> 00:28:52.751
Sahaja Yogi: Two years back.

00:28:52.959 --> 00:28:55.334
Shri Mataji: No, but this time you were not there.All right.

00:28:55.542 --> 00:28:58.834
You might get the pictures of that. All right.

00:28:59.042 --> 00:29:02.751
So in the same way when Buddha came in

00:29:03.083 --> 00:29:05.834
first problem was that

00:29:06.042 --> 00:29:10.167
He thought that it's better not to talk about God.

00:29:10.501 --> 00:29:13.751
Because in His search everybody told Him

00:29:13.959 --> 00:29:17.834
the answer was, “Oh it’s God who does it.

00:29:18.042 --> 00:29:22.292
He punishes you. It’s God who gives you this old age.

00:29:22.501 --> 00:29:25.000
It’s God who does it.“ But what is this God after all?

00:29:25.209 --> 00:29:27.292
Why does He do it?” They said, “You better ask the God."

00:29:27.501 --> 00:29:30.292
“Where is the God?”

00:29:30.501 --> 00:29:35.083
So everybody put every blame on God, as usual.

00:29:36.125 --> 00:29:39.334
Even that’s done today, nothing so, so new

00:29:39.584 --> 00:29:42.792
and nothing unusual I should say.

00:29:42.959 --> 00:29:46.209
So this must be done by God, you see.

00:29:46.417 --> 00:29:47.751
If you cut your throat:

00:29:47.959 --> 00:29:53.000
‘God put my knife in my hand and He cut my throat’.

00:29:53.375 --> 00:29:57.375
So you see, He thought better not talk of God.

00:29:57.626 --> 00:30:00.709
Because everybody is going towards God.

00:30:01.083 --> 00:30:03.542
Then the people whom He met they said,

00:30:03.751 --> 00:30:06.292
“Now I have become God.” He said, “How?”

00:30:06.501 --> 00:30:09.042
He said: "I am God now.” “For what? Why?”

00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:11.209
Because he could mesmerize people,

00:30:11.417 --> 00:30:15.375
he said: “I have become God.” Just imagine!

00:30:15.584 --> 00:30:18.959
So He thought that it’s very dangerous to talk of God

00:30:19.167 --> 00:30:22.209
because people take God in the hand and use it

00:30:22.417 --> 00:30:23.959
for their own purpose,

00:30:24.167 --> 00:30:28.626
always say, “Oh this is what the God has to do

00:30:28.834 --> 00:30:30.375
and it’s God has

00:30:30.584 --> 00:30:33.000
done it and I’m in connection with God and I’ll tell God.”

00:30:33.417 --> 00:30:37.125
So He got a fright and He said that, “Better not talk about God.

00:30:37.334 --> 00:30:40.876
Because that puts the attention of the people on ritualism,

00:30:41.083 --> 00:30:44.667
artificial things, they are building temples after temples,

00:30:44.876 --> 00:30:47.250
and just doing all these horrible things

00:30:47.584 --> 00:30:53.375
which one should not do. Like if you go to the south you’ll find

00:30:53.584 --> 00:30:57.167
in the temples they shave their heads of the ladies,

00:30:57.375 --> 00:30:59.751
they shave it completely.

00:30:59.959 --> 00:31:01.626
And they have to -

00:31:01.834 --> 00:31:05.417
it’s all cobbled along the sides of the wall,

00:31:05.626 --> 00:31:08.042
some walls of the temple.

00:31:08.334 --> 00:31:11.042
And the ladies who shaved their heads

00:31:11.334 --> 00:31:14.584
are just rolling along the sides, you see.

00:31:14.792 --> 00:31:19.167
They have to do sometimes 1008 times, rolling - imagine,

00:31:19.501 --> 00:31:21.834
and the water is poured on them.

00:31:22.042 --> 00:31:25.501
God knows what is the ritual, from where it has come!

00:31:25.792 --> 00:31:28.792
So the poor women go on rolling, rolling, rolling like that

00:31:28.959 --> 00:31:31.334
and somebody is pouring water on them all the time,

00:31:31.542 --> 00:31:32.876
buckets after buckets.

00:31:33.083 --> 00:31:36.584
Her husband and her brother and all they’re doing one after another,

00:31:36.792 --> 00:31:38.167
you see one is finished then another one.

00:31:38.375 --> 00:31:40.083
Poor ladies rolling like that,

00:31:40.292 --> 00:31:45.959
on that muddy sort of a cobbled area.

00:31:46.417 --> 00:31:49.042
I mean, I was shocked when I saw this.  I said: “What’s this?”

00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:52.501
And then later on you see they became modern,

00:31:52.792 --> 00:31:56.626
so they started selling the hair, you see, abroad,

00:31:56.834 --> 00:32:00.751
so the whole thing became a big industry in Madras, you see,

00:32:00.959 --> 00:32:05.292
the hair was made into this bouffant and all they call it, here,

00:32:05.501 --> 00:32:09.375
and they sent it to England and other places.

00:32:09.626 --> 00:32:14.501
So it’s, I mean, in the name of God ridiculous things were done,

00:32:14.709 --> 00:32:17.000
ridiculous things were done!

00:32:17.209 --> 00:32:19.209
So He just thought: Better not talk about God.

00:32:19.417 --> 00:32:22.626
The first step is Self-Realization.

00:32:22.918 --> 00:32:25.000
He was a great Sahaja Yogi I must say.

00:32:25.209 --> 00:32:27.959
Because He said nothing doing, don't talk about God or anything,

00:32:28.167 --> 00:32:30.709
first you get your Realization.

00:32:30.918 --> 00:32:34.334
That was the first condition, establish it.

00:32:34.542 --> 00:32:37.626
Unless and until you have established your Realization,

00:32:37.834 --> 00:32:38.792
- nothing doing.

00:32:38.959 --> 00:32:46.417
So He just started His own method of propagating Buddhi

00:32:46.667 --> 00:32:49.751
Buddha's knowledge or you can Buddhism you can say as they call it.

00:32:49.959 --> 00:32:51.834
Of course it became ‘ism’ later on.

00:32:52.042 --> 00:32:54.334
So all that He started

00:32:54.542 --> 00:32:58.792
with the idea that people should first become Buddha.

00:32:58.959 --> 00:33:03.501
Buddha means realized, Buddha is ‘to know’.

00:33:03.792 --> 00:33:07.250
So "Buddha" means the person who has known,

00:33:07.459 --> 00:33:10.584
means the one who is a Realized soul.

00:33:10.834 --> 00:33:14.626
So what He says, “Buddham Sharanam Gachhami”,

00:33:14.834 --> 00:33:18.000
I bow, no I surrender – ‘sharanam’ means surrender,

00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:24.542
I surrender to the Buddhas - means to all the Sahaja Yogis.

00:33:25.167 --> 00:33:28.501
You are all Buddhas because you know.

00:33:28.709 --> 00:33:32.375
When you know, you are the Buddha.

00:33:32.876 --> 00:33:36.209
Now without going into all that nonsense

00:33:36.417 --> 00:33:41.167
of renunciation and shaving your head and wearing that dress

00:33:41.375 --> 00:33:43.834
and everything, you have achieved your Realization.

00:33:44.042 --> 00:33:47.709
It’s a short circuit or a short path.

00:33:47.918 --> 00:33:51.792
Why? Because He started from the other side.

00:33:51.959 --> 00:33:57.792
But if He had started directly from Himself, you see,

00:33:58.626 --> 00:34:00.083
it would have been better.

00:34:00.292 --> 00:34:04.751
You see, in practical sense I'll tell you how it is.

00:34:07.292 --> 00:34:11.959
Supposing you want to repair your house.

00:34:12.292 --> 00:34:15.959
So you have to have instrument for that house.

00:34:16.542 --> 00:34:20.042
But supposing you are worried about all the houses of the world.

00:34:20.417 --> 00:34:25.417
and you start repairing, neither you'll repair other houses nor yours.

00:34:25.626 --> 00:34:29.292
So first you must practice on yourself.

00:34:30.459 --> 00:34:33.792
Put your attention to yourself first.

00:34:33.959 --> 00:34:38.959
Is also is a method by which you avoid

00:34:39.167 --> 00:34:41.042
seeing the point,

00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:42.667
seeing the reality,

00:34:42.959 --> 00:34:48.167
that, if you are not all right, how can you improve the whole world?

00:34:48.417 --> 00:34:52.000
So when your attention goes to other things, are

00:34:52.209 --> 00:34:55.042
you must know that there’s something wrong with you first of all,

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:57.667
which must be corrected.

00:34:57.876 --> 00:34:59.083
And that’s why

00:34:59.292 --> 00:35:02.292
it took Him so much time to go round and round and round.

00:35:02.626 --> 00:35:05.209
He had to give up His wife, give up His family,

00:35:05.417 --> 00:35:08.542
give up everything and get to Realization.

00:35:08.918 --> 00:35:11.417
Because by giving up everything He realized

00:35:11.667 --> 00:35:14.375
that it is He, who should achieve it.

00:35:14.751 --> 00:35:17.417
It's a very circuitous way,

00:35:17.626 --> 00:35:19.709
but you can just say: It doesn't exist anything,

00:35:19.918 --> 00:35:23.334
first let me get all right - that’s Sahaja Yoga.

00:35:24.501 --> 00:35:28.918
Now what happened, that became a method for people to achieve God.

00:35:29.125 --> 00:35:34.375
Many people think that you must suffer like Christ to achieve God.

00:35:35.709 --> 00:35:39.209
You must renounce the world then achieve God.

00:35:39.417 --> 00:35:43.751
Actually renouncing the world and all that is just a myth.

00:35:43.959 --> 00:35:46.459
How do you renounce the world?

00:35:46.709 --> 00:35:48.459
It’s myth. What are you renouncing?

00:35:48.667 --> 00:35:51.375
I mean in any case, you can’t carry this with you, can you?

00:35:51.792 --> 00:35:55.792
I mean, can you even carry, I would say, even a thread?

00:35:55.959 --> 00:35:59.375
Nothing! When you come you come like this, you are born

00:35:59.709 --> 00:36:02.709
with closed fists. When you go, the hands are like this open.

00:36:02.959 --> 00:36:05.250
Have you ever seen a dead corpse?

00:36:05.459 --> 00:36:07.792
He always has his hands like this. Nothing can he take,

00:36:07.959 --> 00:36:11.167
just going like this.

00:36:11.667 --> 00:36:13.792
So you don't take anything from here.

00:36:13.959 --> 00:36:17.209
So this renouncing, this ‘I renounce that’, ‘I renounce that"

00:36:17.417 --> 00:36:21.876
'I’ll give up this’, ‘I’ll give up my wife’, ‘I’ll give up that",

00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:23.918
has no meaning.

00:36:24.584 --> 00:36:28.626
Because it’s a state of mind in which your

00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:33.834
being becomes -

00:36:34.042 --> 00:36:35.876
I don't know the English word for that

00:36:36.083 --> 00:36:40.167
which doesn't stick to something, what is it called?

00:36:42.209 --> 00:36:48.918
I don't know. You see, any substance that doesn't stick to anything.

00:36:49.125 --> 00:36:52.792
I mean we have all kind of stick plast. Yogi: Unattached?

00:36:52.959 --> 00:36:55.584
Shri Mataji: No, but that quality.

00:36:55.792 --> 00:37:01.334
There is a quality of the temperament, which doesn't stick to anything.

00:37:02.834 --> 00:37:05.792
Doesn't stick to anything, I mean you put it here, it will come out.

00:37:06.083 --> 00:37:10.417
You can say the soap or something like that –

00:37:10.626 --> 00:37:13.584
Yogi: Like mercury. Mother, like mercury, just flows.

00:37:13.834 --> 00:37:15.959
Shri Mataji: Ah - like mercury.

00:37:16.167 --> 00:37:18.834
But mercury also you can apply sometimes,

00:37:19.042 --> 00:37:22.042
you know with heat and, but this is something beyond mercury,

00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:26.667
is absolute, which doesn't stick to anything, you see.

00:37:26.876 --> 00:37:28.459
You just become like that.

00:37:28.667 --> 00:37:32.918
All you do, wear this, you wear that, you have this, all right.

00:37:33.125 --> 00:37:35.334
You are never stuck.

00:37:35.584 --> 00:37:40.501
Then name of the Goddess is ‘Nirmama’, ‘Nirmama’,

00:37:40.501 --> 00:37:43.667
that for Her nothing is Her own, you see,

00:37:43.876 --> 00:37:46.209
see, She doesn't stick to anything.

00:37:46.709 --> 00:37:49.959
She is in everything, but She doesn't stick to anything.

00:37:50.209 --> 00:37:52.709
For example now see the light here,

00:37:52.918 --> 00:37:58.501
it’s not sticking to anything, it exists by itself.

00:37:58.834 --> 00:38:00.918
It doesn’t stick to anything.

00:38:01.125 --> 00:38:03.959
This is the nearest you can say, it doesn't stick to anything.

00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:08.667
Any but thing tries to stick it gets burned, that’s a good idea.

00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:13.542
So this is what it is,

00:38:13.751 --> 00:38:18.000
this is called an enlightened person doesn't stick to anything.

00:38:18.542 --> 00:38:23.167
And whatever tries to come very close gets burnt off.

00:38:23.375 --> 00:38:29.042
So, such a person is not attached to anything.

00:38:29.292 --> 00:38:32.042
But that’s not a mental thing that you can do

00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:33.792
that, “Oh I am not attached to you”, you see.

00:38:33.959 --> 00:38:37.167
It’s very common in this country especially, “I hate you”.

00:38:37.459 --> 00:38:39.918
Then you can't hate anyone. How can you?

00:38:40.125 --> 00:38:42.209
And nor can you love anyone because

00:38:42.417 --> 00:38:48.375
the attachment cannot give you both the qualities.

00:38:48.584 --> 00:38:52.501
You see, because you are attached to someone,

00:38:52.709 --> 00:38:56.959
you say that you hate, simultaneously you are loving that person.

00:38:57.167 --> 00:39:02.250
Because these are the dual qualities of attachment, see?

00:39:02.501 --> 00:39:05.834
So once you have attachment you have both things.

00:39:06.042 --> 00:39:08.709
One moment you hate, another moment you love,

00:39:08.959 --> 00:39:10.209
another moment you hate,

00:39:10.417 --> 00:39:12.751
then you love and you don't know what's the matter with yourself.

00:39:13.083 --> 00:39:17.584
But the thing is the quality of the mind is such that

00:39:17.792 --> 00:39:22.584
it is either getting attached mentally

00:39:22.792 --> 00:39:26.083
or either getting detached mentally.

00:39:26.667 --> 00:39:32.501
But actually anybody say, you love someone very much.

00:39:32.792 --> 00:39:36.792
Now you don't even die together, whatever you may try.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.584
You cannot die together.

00:39:38.792 --> 00:39:41.751
One person has to die earlier, another has to die later.

00:39:42.459 --> 00:39:46.709
So the answer to His question that He asked was,

00:39:46.959 --> 00:39:48.959
“Why all these things are caused?”

00:39:49.167 --> 00:39:54.542
So he said, it is because of desire.

00:39:54.876 --> 00:39:59.792
Because of human desire, these are all problems are caused,

00:39:59.959 --> 00:40:06.792
like the death, like the old age

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.918
or the sickness, are caused by desire.

00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:15.083
Now see in Sahaja Yoga language how we should understand Him.

00:40:15.667 --> 00:40:21.042
Is the desire, as you know, is the left side.

00:40:23.417 --> 00:40:26.792
Left side gives you death.

00:40:26.959 --> 00:40:31.501
When the left side is very much used

00:40:31.709 --> 00:40:35.667
you get to death, ultimately when it is exhausted.

00:40:35.918 --> 00:40:40.709
When the left side is out, desire,

00:40:40.918 --> 00:40:44.417
you also get sickness.

00:40:45.042 --> 00:40:52.876
And when the left side is used too much you get your old age.

00:40:53.584 --> 00:40:58.918
Of course the right side is the one which does it,

00:40:59.125 --> 00:41:02.125
but the left side is the originator.

00:41:02.334 --> 00:41:05.709
If you have no desire you won't go into the right side.

00:41:05.918 --> 00:41:10.459
First is the desire, the starting point is the desire.

00:41:10.751 --> 00:41:14.167
He reached the point all right, but He didn't clearly say

00:41:14.375 --> 00:41:17.918
what desire means: Desire means the left side.

00:41:18.209 --> 00:41:24.667
When we have the pure desire, which is the Kundalini,

00:41:24.918 --> 00:41:28.417
then all these things are neutralized.

00:41:29.459 --> 00:41:34.042
When the Kundalini rises the pure desire, the real desire,

00:41:34.292 --> 00:41:37.042
the only desire, it gives you the absolute

00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:40.751
by which you don't get old,

00:41:40.959 --> 00:41:45.584
you don’t die and you do not get sick.

00:41:45.792 --> 00:41:52.292
Because you achieve that which is eternal, it does not die.

00:41:52.542 --> 00:41:54.000
You become the Spirit.

00:41:54.209 --> 00:41:56.584
When you want to die, you die.

00:41:56.834 --> 00:42:00.375
When you want to be reborn, you are reborn, and

00:42:00.709 --> 00:42:06.584
you have that realized temperament within you. It does not die.

00:42:06.792 --> 00:42:09.334
That's what you take with you.

00:42:09.584 --> 00:42:15.959
Now you take your Realization with you when you die.

00:42:16.792 --> 00:42:19.209
So what He tried to say was to build up

00:42:19.417 --> 00:42:22.584
that we should not have any desires.

00:42:22.792 --> 00:42:27.209
Now because, you see, His passage was like that, He went from

00:42:27.626 --> 00:42:30.834
one to another, giving up this desire, that desire, that desire,

00:42:31.042 --> 00:42:34.959
that desire - ultimately He came to Kundalini.

00:42:35.751 --> 00:42:39.083
There’s a saying, “Ya neti neti vachanair nigama avocham”

00:42:39.292 --> 00:42:40.292
When you go on saying:

00:42:40.501 --> 00:42:43.334
'Not this, not this, not this, not this, not this',

00:42:43.709 --> 00:42:46.125
then you go to a point, when you say “Then

00:42:46.584 --> 00:42:51.417
what ultimately left is the desire, which is the pure desire,

00:42:51.626 --> 00:42:54.000
the desire, that is the Kundalini.

00:42:54.334 --> 00:42:55.792
Say for example

00:42:55.959 --> 00:42:58.334
you say, “I’ll have a house -  no, no, I’ll not have a house,

00:42:58.542 --> 00:42:59.792
I’ll have a car, no, no car,no,

00:42:59.959 --> 00:43:03.459
I’ll not have a wife, I’ll not look at any woman.

00:43:03.667 --> 00:43:05.292
I’ll have nothing to do with it.

00:43:05.501 --> 00:43:09.292
I'll give up this, give up that, give up that, give up that.

00:43:09.667 --> 00:43:15.250
Till you reach a point where you are at an absolute point.

00:43:15.459 --> 00:43:18.125
And there you realize that the Kundalini rises.

00:43:18.501 --> 00:43:19.584
But I think it is going too far.

00:43:19.792 --> 00:43:22.584
Why not start from the Kundalini rising? There.

00:43:24.918 --> 00:43:26.000
Is a simple thing.

00:43:26.209 --> 00:43:29.334
So Sahaja Yoga is the other way round stuff,

00:43:29.542 --> 00:43:31.876
is that you better start from the Kundalini.

00:43:32.125 --> 00:43:35.501
and neutralize all your left side.

00:43:36.709 --> 00:43:37.834
You see the point now?

00:43:38.042 --> 00:43:42.501
That's why Buddha was always regarded as an atheist.

00:43:42.834 --> 00:43:45.501
He was not. He was not an atheist.

00:43:45.709 --> 00:43:48.542
But as a matter of policy,

00:43:49.417 --> 00:43:52.501
He and Mahavira -they were contemporary -

00:43:52.709 --> 00:43:59.167
they decided: Let's not have the name of God anywhere near,

00:43:59.542 --> 00:44:01.959
because once you start the god business,

00:44:02.167 --> 00:44:07.501
big philosophies are built and people just start claiming it.

00:44:07.792 --> 00:44:09.292
I mean, they become that!

00:44:09.501 --> 00:44:14.459
Actually anybody who reads Geeta becomes a sort of a Krishna,

00:44:14.709 --> 00:44:16.459
Shri Krishna Himself, it’s the way he talks,

00:44:16.792 --> 00:44:19.667
people - you can be shocked the way they talk I mean

00:44:19.876 --> 00:44:22.751
they are Shri Krishna, giving an advice to Arjuna, you know,

00:44:22.959 --> 00:44:24.709
sitting on a chariot.

00:44:24.918 --> 00:44:28.042
They behave in that manner, you know their style is like that.

00:44:28.250 --> 00:44:31.250
I met one fellow called Chinmayanand

00:44:31.501 --> 00:44:34.834
and I was amazed you know the way he was talking,  I was surprised,

00:44:35.042 --> 00:44:37.334
I mean he was just behaving like Shri Krishna,

00:44:37.542 --> 00:44:39.083
of course horrid looking,

00:44:39.292 --> 00:44:43.792
but, he thought he was Shri Krishna himself, you see.

00:44:43.959 --> 00:44:46.834
So that's what identification takes place with human beings

00:44:47.042 --> 00:44:49.751
when they start talking about God or His ways and others.

00:44:49.959 --> 00:44:51.792
So He said: "All right put that out,

00:44:51.959 --> 00:44:55.292
just talk about Self-Realization. That's the first step."

00:44:55.501 --> 00:44:59.751
And Mahavira joined hands with Him.

00:45:00.125 --> 00:45:02.459
It helped that time very much,

00:45:02.751 --> 00:45:06.626
to all the people who were in the name of ritualism you see,

00:45:06.834 --> 00:45:09.000
they would say, “It’s very difficult, you know,

00:45:09.209 --> 00:45:12.417
Hinduism is the most difficult thing."

00:45:12.667 --> 00:45:17.250
You have to fast on Sunday, because of the sun,

00:45:17.459 --> 00:45:20.083
Monday because of the moon,

00:45:20.292 --> 00:45:24.000
Tuesday because of the Mars. Like that went on and on,

00:45:24.209 --> 00:45:28.209
and when do you eat your food?

00:45:28.417 --> 00:45:32.292
If you have to achieve God then you have to

00:45:32.501 --> 00:45:36.375
take your bath at four o’clock and do this and do that and

00:45:36.709 --> 00:45:40.000
shave your head and then you become a sanyasi,

00:45:40.250 --> 00:45:43.417
and you can't eat this and you can't eat that,

00:45:43.626 --> 00:45:47.459
and you can't do that - all those things ritualistic they started.

00:45:47.834 --> 00:45:51.792
But He felt that supposing if you take to sanyasa,

00:45:51.959 --> 00:45:55.459
so half of your desires are finished, you are a sanyasi,

00:45:55.667 --> 00:45:58.542
you are doing God's work

00:45:58.751 --> 00:46:01.375
and there is no need to have a family or anything,

00:46:01.584 --> 00:46:03.501
so half of your desires are finished.

00:46:03.709 --> 00:46:06.626
If you have a family then you want to do something for the family,

00:46:06.834 --> 00:46:10.125
you have to look after your family and all that is to be done.

00:46:10.375 --> 00:46:15.751
But He did not realize that He was a Realized soul, others were not.

00:46:15.959 --> 00:46:21.792
You see, if a realized soul does that, it has no difference to him;

00:46:21.959 --> 00:46:23.542
whether he has a family or no family

00:46:23.751 --> 00:46:25.083
makes no difference to a realized soul,

00:46:25.292 --> 00:46:26.584
because he is not attached.

00:46:26.792 --> 00:46:31.417
But to a person who is not a realized soul,

00:46:31.667 --> 00:46:34.834
supposing he’ll give up his car, he’ll give up his house,

00:46:35.042 --> 00:46:36.709
go to the Himalayas.

00:46:36.918 --> 00:46:37.918
There, what he’ll do?

00:46:38.125 --> 00:46:44.584
He’ll have a hut and have a barbed thing around or so.

00:46:45.375 --> 00:46:48.542
Then he may think of a Georgian style of a house

00:46:48.751 --> 00:46:51.792
if he's an English man,

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.125
because according to them Georgian style is unpretentious,

00:46:56.334 --> 00:46:59.918
so we can have, after all we are sanyasis!

00:47:00.125 --> 00:47:01.334
That’s typical!

00:47:01.542 --> 00:47:07.083
I tell you all our western mind is behaving in that way, if you see,

00:47:07.334 --> 00:47:10.250
that we should be unpretentious, you see, it’s very fussy,

00:47:10.542 --> 00:47:11.584
is the word they will use.

00:47:11.792 --> 00:47:15.000
If you put even a little [thing]: "Oh it’s very fussy."

00:47:15.209 --> 00:47:18.959
They want everything to be plain, blunt, you see?

00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:24.709
But what about inside? I’s filled with what?

00:47:24.918 --> 00:47:29.250
All bottled up with all kinds of rums, this, that.

00:47:29.501 --> 00:47:34.083
But the outside should be absolutely blunt, you know.

00:47:34.292 --> 00:47:36.083
The food should not be,

00:47:36.292 --> 00:47:39.375
if possible just get it in its natural form.

00:47:39.584 --> 00:47:42.792
If not, don’t have any taste in it.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:44.876
It should be so blunt that

00:47:45.083 --> 00:47:48.584
any guest who comes to your house must starve, you see.

00:47:48.792 --> 00:47:53.334
All these funny ideas cropped up in that - of asceticism.

00:47:53.584 --> 00:47:55.792
Then we have other people like Shamballas.

00:47:55.959 --> 00:47:58.375
who are going now to Gobi desert.

00:47:58.584 --> 00:48:01.250
You see, they thought that this desert is not sufficient,

00:48:01.459 --> 00:48:02.667
let’s go to Gobi desert.

00:48:02.876 --> 00:48:04.667
So they are going now to Gobi desert.

00:48:04.876 --> 00:48:07.209
All these absurd ideas

00:48:07.417 --> 00:48:11.918
came out of Buddhism, and also Jainism.

00:48:12.125 --> 00:48:15.459
Jainis went to the other extreme in vegetarianism,

00:48:15.834 --> 00:48:20.542
because Buddha Himself was not a vegetarian, do you know that?

00:48:20.751 --> 00:48:25.584
He was not Himself a vegetarian, nor was Mahavira.

00:48:25.792 --> 00:48:32.000
You will be surprised: Vegetarianism for them was a philosophy.

00:48:32.209 --> 00:48:39.083
It was not a sort of a thing where you don't eat meat and all,

00:48:39.292 --> 00:48:44.375
because Buddha Himself died when He went to one of His disciples

00:48:44.584 --> 00:48:52.584
who was a ‘shikari’ – hunter.

00:48:52.959 --> 00:48:56.959
And the hunter had killed a wild boar.

00:48:57.167 --> 00:49:00.834
And he said that the wild boar has been killed just now

00:49:01.083 --> 00:49:06.918
and it will take some time to cook, it’s rather half done, you see.

00:49:07.167 --> 00:49:10.792
I mean, He beeing an Indian, He could not eat that half done thing

00:49:10.959 --> 00:49:17.375
and He got diseased of, I think, this liver or something got

00:49:17.667 --> 00:49:20.334
into problem and He died of that, you see.

00:49:20.584 --> 00:49:23.250
I mean, I can't eat half done food Myself.

00:49:23.459 --> 00:49:26.209
"This is half done now." Half done is a horrible stuff,

00:49:26.417 --> 00:49:28.626
but we eat because it is unpretentious, you see

00:49:28.959 --> 00:49:30.125
or some sort of a thing.

00:49:30.334 --> 00:49:35.125
People have idea it’s not, it’s very next to the nature, you see.

00:49:35.334 --> 00:49:38.584
This is what is coming. But it’s all deliberate.

00:49:38.876 --> 00:49:40.834
You are attached inside.

00:49:41.042 --> 00:49:44.667
Outside, if you behave like that you are not going to become that.

00:49:44.876 --> 00:49:50.334
Like Hippies have an idea, if they live like primitive people,

00:49:50.542 --> 00:49:54.792
then they become primitive. You cannot, your brain is modern.

00:49:54.959 --> 00:49:58.083
Just by living, you see, wearing a wig like a hippy,

00:49:58.292 --> 00:49:59.751
can I become primitive?

00:49:59.959 --> 00:50:02.334
I cannot, My brain is modern, you see?

00:50:02.542 --> 00:50:06.667
That’s what people don't understand, that we are too deliberate.

00:50:06.876 --> 00:50:09.959
And all these deliberations can be only reduced

00:50:10.167 --> 00:50:14.542
if your Self comes into your attention.

00:50:14.751 --> 00:50:19.626
Otherwise all these are just our mental projections.

00:50:19.834 --> 00:50:24.626
So all these sanyasa and all these ideas came gradually,

00:50:24.834 --> 00:50:27.375
everyone who came on this Earth,

00:50:27.584 --> 00:50:31.167
people have really made a mess out of them.

00:50:31.375 --> 00:50:35.042
And Buddha's mess has gone to such an extent

00:50:35.250 --> 00:50:38.667
that if you see that you’ll be shocked.

00:50:39.083 --> 00:50:41.959
It went into many formations.

00:50:42.209 --> 00:50:44.042
But I heard from My son-in-law that

00:50:44.250 --> 00:50:46.459
he went and visited some of the caves

00:50:46.667 --> 00:50:50.083
where the very early Buddhist lived, very early Buddhist lived.

00:50:50.292 --> 00:50:53.959
In the caves, because they were not supported by kings or anything,

00:50:54.167 --> 00:50:56.125
so they had a very bad time.

00:50:56.334 --> 00:50:58.083
And they used to live in the caves.

00:50:58.292 --> 00:51:03.584
And what My son-in-law told Me that in the caves there are writings

00:51:03.834 --> 00:51:08.417
in Sanskrit, in Pali and in Indian script,

00:51:08.667 --> 00:51:12.209
saying that it is the spontaneous happening

00:51:12.417 --> 00:51:15.959
that can bring forth the Self-Realization.

00:51:16.501 --> 00:51:20.334
He has got that photographed.

00:51:20.667 --> 00:51:24.125
So it’s coming forward. You see, so they knew about it,

00:51:24.334 --> 00:51:27.501
the Sahaja Yoga, they knew about it.

00:51:27.709 --> 00:51:30.751
But then as every religion has gone into a mess

00:51:30.959 --> 00:51:36.751
and lot of funny sort of, we can say the -

00:51:36.959 --> 00:51:42.459
funny sort of expressions, also Buddhism has gone,

00:51:42.667 --> 00:51:46.709
it became Mahayan, Hinayan, all sorts of things.

00:51:46.918 --> 00:51:52.250
But one of them was called as Vidhitama,

00:51:52.501 --> 00:51:56.167
who ran away from India, settled down in Japan

00:51:56.459 --> 00:51:59.459
and he started the Zen system of religion,

00:51:59.667 --> 00:52:02.417
which he kept to the spontaneous happening.

00:52:02.626 --> 00:52:05.209
That one was preserved.

00:52:05.417 --> 00:52:11.125
Another was the Lao Tse style, who did not talk of God

00:52:11.334 --> 00:52:14.667
and of Buddha, but of Tao itself -

00:52:14.876 --> 00:52:19.083
the energy or we can say about the Adishakti.

00:52:19.292 --> 00:52:22.459
So these two good things came out of Him.

00:52:22.667 --> 00:52:27.792
While they searched back into the history of China

00:52:27.959 --> 00:52:30.501
and they found out the Adishakti

00:52:30.709 --> 00:52:34.667
lived many years back there as Kuan Yin.

00:52:34.918 --> 00:52:38.834
And that’s how Kuan Yin was established

00:52:39.042 --> 00:52:42.751
as a Goddess for many Buddhists.

00:52:42.959 --> 00:52:47.417
Now then Buddha also got

00:52:47.626 --> 00:52:50.709
into another form because

00:52:50.959 --> 00:52:53.792
there was a big competition between Hinduism,

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:58.209
Hindus of those days and the Buddhists.

00:52:58.417 --> 00:53:00.209
So they wanted to form,

00:53:00.417 --> 00:53:03.959
for ordinary people it’s very difficult to understand the philosophy

00:53:04.250 --> 00:53:08.375
so they thought that we should have Buddha expressed

00:53:08.584 --> 00:53:12.125
as He has been and He will be.

00:53:12.375 --> 00:53:18.125
So they formed their, you see, as you see He is a Matreya

00:53:18.334 --> 00:53:20.918
is going to come, the future Buddha is Bodhisatva

00:53:21.125 --> 00:53:23.751
and they started making His statues and everything.

00:53:23.959 --> 00:53:26.584
So they made Buddha as the God.

00:53:26.834 --> 00:53:32.876
They started using Him to represent the Divine Power,

00:53:33.125 --> 00:53:36.334
giving Him forms and things and like hat many things happened.

00:53:36.542 --> 00:53:39.959
But Buddha Himself was so much frightened of the ritualism

00:53:40.167 --> 00:53:43.292
that He said, “You should not worship anything,

00:53:43.501 --> 00:53:45.834
you should not build any temples

00:53:46.125 --> 00:53:48.083
so you see the loophole was found out,

00:53:48.292 --> 00:53:51.542
if temples are not to be built, we’ll build stupas.

00:53:51.959 --> 00:53:57.250
Now in the Stupas they put the tooth of Buddha,

00:53:57.459 --> 00:54:00.083
of course that was sensible to do I must say,

00:54:00.417 --> 00:54:02.542
but of course Buddha had said not to do it.

00:54:02.751 --> 00:54:04.959
And they put it there, He had two disciples,

00:54:05.167 --> 00:54:07.501
called as Sariputta and Moggallana.

00:54:07.709 --> 00:54:10.042
They were very good disciples of His

00:54:10.250 --> 00:54:14.792
and their bones were collected after they were burnt out

00:54:14.959 --> 00:54:17.542
and were put in the stupa.

00:54:17.751 --> 00:54:20.834
That was something definitely sensible to put them there.

00:54:21.042 --> 00:54:23.876
Of course the bones and all these things should not be disturbed

00:54:24.083 --> 00:54:26.834
because it’s not good, it creates a problem for the body.

00:54:27.042 --> 00:54:31.584
But at least if they have put it there in the Mother Earth

00:54:31.792 --> 00:54:34.792
it would have been all right. but they put it in caskets.

00:54:34.959 --> 00:54:37.959
Now the first casket was made of gold,

00:54:38.167 --> 00:54:42.584
the second of silver, the third of iron,

00:54:42.792 --> 00:54:46.709
the fourth one of wood sort of a thing, mummified those things.

00:54:46.959 --> 00:54:49.209
That was a very wrong thing to do, because

00:54:49.417 --> 00:54:51.626
because if you go on keeping like that,

00:54:51.834 --> 00:54:53.792
some parts of the body of these great people,

00:54:54.083 --> 00:55:01.417
it can hamper their rebirth or their body

00:55:01.626 --> 00:55:04.334
which they want to again incarnate, you see.

00:55:04.542 --> 00:55:06.959
But hair is all right or nails are all right,

00:55:07.167 --> 00:55:10.083
but you shouldn’t keep the part of dead body like that.

00:55:10.292 --> 00:55:15.167
And this kind of thing gave another nonsensical ideas to

00:55:15.542 --> 00:55:17.375
to horrible human beeings.

00:55:17.709 --> 00:55:22.250
What they did, that they thought that if we have to keep some part

00:55:22.584 --> 00:55:25.667
of the person who died like divine person,

00:55:25.876 --> 00:55:29.626
why not we cut the hand of someone and like that.

00:55:29.834 --> 00:55:35.542
So in Tibet and all these places, specially in Ladhak, you see,

00:55:35.792 --> 00:55:39.125
they used to cut the hands of the people when they died

00:55:39.334 --> 00:55:40.959
and big ritual for the dead

00:55:41.167 --> 00:55:43.417
and then they started going towards the dead.

00:55:43.626 --> 00:55:47.125
So they started moving towards the left side.

00:55:47.334 --> 00:55:50.584
Most of the Buddhists moved to the left side,

00:55:50.792 --> 00:55:56.501
which was absolutely prohibited by Buddha,

00:55:56.751 --> 00:55:59.959
because He is on the right side.

00:56:00.167 --> 00:56:06.751
He said, “Cut down your desires, do the karmas without the desire”.

00:56:06.959 --> 00:56:08.292
This was His idea.

00:56:08.501 --> 00:56:12.792
Activate your right side without the desire.

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:14.626
This was His philosophy.

00:56:15.083 --> 00:56:18.834
But they - all of them are left sided.

00:56:19.083 --> 00:56:22.959
They have desires, not only desires

00:56:23.167 --> 00:56:26.876
but whatever they do they do it out of desire.

00:56:27.083 --> 00:56:31.626
Like the worst is like the Japanese,

00:56:31.876 --> 00:56:36.042
they think that you can

00:56:36.250 --> 00:56:42.584
commit suicide in the name of your nation.

00:56:42.959 --> 00:56:47.959
With this desire they will commit suicide.

00:56:48.334 --> 00:56:50.417
To save their country they can commit suicide.

00:56:50.626 --> 00:56:52.584
I mean it is absurd.

00:56:52.792 --> 00:56:56.334
He said, “Whatever you have to do, do without the desire”,

00:56:56.542 --> 00:56:58.125
which is a difficult thing for human beings.

00:56:58.334 --> 00:57:02.042
How many there are who are doing it without desire?

00:57:02.375 --> 00:57:05.792
And whatever we do, we do out of desire.

00:57:05.959 --> 00:57:08.250
Even at the subtler point.

00:57:08.501 --> 00:57:09.918
Even when we do puja,

00:57:10.125 --> 00:57:15.125
we do with the desire that our vibrations will improve.

00:57:15.334 --> 00:57:19.959
Can we think of a state where it is absolutely desireless?

00:57:20.292 --> 00:57:26.959
Only one person has that, there’s no desire, desireless.

00:57:27.167 --> 00:57:29.459
The whole thing is done without any desire,

00:57:29.667 --> 00:57:31.792
so there is no disappointment.

00:57:32.834 --> 00:57:34.417
There is no unhappiness.

00:57:34.626 --> 00:57:35.918
You are going to America,

00:57:36.125 --> 00:57:41.959
knowingly that is going to be a horrible experience,

00:57:42.250 --> 00:57:46.000
but it’s a joke, just going to see the joke.

00:57:46.209 --> 00:57:48.542
Without any hope,

00:57:48.876 --> 00:57:53.584
maybe it might work out to be something tremendous,

00:57:53.792 --> 00:57:55.334
but no desires.

00:57:55.542 --> 00:57:59.792
You see, it’s so desireless the whole personality is,

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:01.709
that even if I have to desire for something

00:58:01.918 --> 00:58:03.250
I have to ask you, "You better desire!",

00:58:03.459 --> 00:58:05.959
because I have lost the sense of desire.

00:58:06.209 --> 00:58:09.375
So many times I’ve said you better do it for Me.

00:58:09.584 --> 00:58:12.959
Unless and until you pray to Me I can't do it.

00:58:13.209 --> 00:58:15.167
That's why I asked you write to Me a letter,

00:58:15.375 --> 00:58:16.626
because you see, I can't desire,

00:58:16.834 --> 00:58:18.501
i really don't. I don't do anything!

00:58:18.709 --> 00:58:21.792
Without doing anything it is happening. So why should I desire?

00:58:21.959 --> 00:58:25.626
I really don't do anything.

00:58:25.918 --> 00:58:28.792
You'll be amazed, I don't do anything, I don't desire anything,

00:58:28.959 --> 00:58:30.876
nothing of the kind, it’s working I am just watching.

00:58:31.083 --> 00:58:31.876
Still you are saying,

00:58:32.083 --> 00:58:38.000
“Mother you aredoing it.” I'm quite surprised!

00:58:38.417 --> 00:58:40.083
That is Tao.

00:58:40.292 --> 00:58:41.709
If you read about Tao,

00:58:41.959 --> 00:58:45.042
it is said that it doesn’t do anything.

00:58:45.250 --> 00:58:49.209
But everything works out.

00:58:49.417 --> 00:58:52.501
So this is what He said, which was all sahaja,

00:58:52.709 --> 00:58:55.083
that you have to be desireless

00:58:55.292 --> 00:58:57.918
and do everything,

00:58:58.125 --> 00:59:03.250
and He is the one who controls our ego.

00:59:03.459 --> 00:59:08.501
Because if you have no desire you will have no ego either.

00:59:09.209 --> 00:59:10.876
Ego is only built up

00:59:11.083 --> 00:59:14.584
when you have a desire to do something.

00:59:14.792 --> 00:59:19.584
That is you just do it for fun, just for joy, just for doing it.

00:59:19.792 --> 00:59:22.125
Then how will you build up ego? You cannot.

00:59:22.334 --> 00:59:26.209
Like an artist is painting just for fun and throwing it away.

00:59:26.459 --> 00:59:30.542
Creating something just for fun – that’s what God is.

00:59:30.834 --> 00:59:33.042
Not with the desire to achieve something.

00:59:33.250 --> 00:59:36.125
I mean the desire is so gross, can be extremely gross.

00:59:36.459 --> 00:59:39.626
It can become subtler and subtler and subtler. That’s a good way.

00:59:39.959 --> 00:59:43.334
But can be very, very gross also,

00:59:43.542 --> 00:59:46.751
like some people can believe that, you see,

00:59:46.959 --> 00:59:51.584
“I should painting, because I'll get so much money."

00:59:51.876 --> 00:59:54.542
Or "I can sell it to somebody

00:59:54.751 --> 00:59:58.292
who may be the worst man, but I’ll sell it because I can get more money.”

00:59:58.501 --> 01:00:01.083
That’s absolutely the grossest of all, you see.

01:00:01.292 --> 01:00:04.876
That you can go to the most sinful things, I mean, I don’t know,

01:00:05.083 --> 01:00:07.709
there can be even worse desires than that,

01:00:07.959 --> 01:00:09.334
can be very many.

01:00:09.542 --> 01:00:12.042
But on this auspicious day we should not think of them

01:00:12.292 --> 01:00:16.375
which are there like that, but minimum of minimum,

01:00:16.584 --> 01:00:22.417
if you come, just do your puja, just for the joy of it,

01:00:23.042 --> 01:00:25.751
not with any desires.

01:00:26.167 --> 01:00:27.959
Just for the joy of it.

01:00:28.250 --> 01:00:30.501
I mean we are doing so many things like that.

01:00:30.709 --> 01:00:34.834
For example, we enjoy each other’s company.

01:00:35.042 --> 01:00:36.959
Just, just think of that!

01:00:37.167 --> 01:00:39.542
We all Sahaja Yogis are enjoying each other’s company,

01:00:39.792 --> 01:00:43.334
what’s this for? Nothing at all. There’s no, nothing.

01:00:44.667 --> 01:00:47.709
Just, you are enjoying it without any desire.

01:00:47.959 --> 01:00:53.125
Just say, for enjoyment’s sake, enjoyment.

01:00:53.375 --> 01:00:56.542
When that purity comes, you see in our temperament,

01:00:56.834 --> 01:00:59.751
that we do everything without any desire,

01:01:00.042 --> 01:01:03.167
we have got rid of all the ego.

01:01:03.375 --> 01:01:04.959
The Buddha is awakened within us.

01:01:05.167 --> 01:01:07.626
And that’s what is the importance of Buddha,

01:01:07.834 --> 01:01:09.834
that He settled down Himself

01:01:10.042 --> 01:01:12.751
in a place which is the most difficult place,

01:01:13.125 --> 01:01:16.042
that is on the left side of your head, you see.

01:01:16.250 --> 01:01:19.584
Sometimes I've seen it projects here up to this point, you know,

01:01:19.792 --> 01:01:22.751
in some people they get such a terrible pain, you know,

01:01:22.959 --> 01:01:25.792
pulling it out from there, can't imagine.

01:01:25.959 --> 01:01:31.375
So this horrible point which is  -

01:01:31.667 --> 01:01:35.417
so funny it is, sometimes it can blow up like that, you see,

01:01:35.626 --> 01:01:38.876
sometimes it can pierce through. It’s a horrible one

01:01:39.125 --> 01:01:42.042
which all of you have developed quite a lot, you see,

01:01:42.250 --> 01:01:45.417
and it takes it forms in different ways and methods.

01:01:45.667 --> 01:01:51.083
For that we have to say, “Buddham Sharanam Gachhami”,

01:01:51.292 --> 01:01:55.667
means: We surrender ourselves to Buddha.

01:01:56.584 --> 01:01:59.292
Then what does He say? The second one is very good:

01:01:59.501 --> 01:02:02.292
‘Sangham Sharanam Gachhami’:

01:02:02.542 --> 01:02:05.292
I surrender myself to collectivity, ‘sangham’.

01:02:05.501 --> 01:02:07.792
‘Sangha’ is the collectivity.

01:02:07.959 --> 01:02:11.584
I surrender myself to collectivity. Ego goes down.

01:02:11.876 --> 01:02:14.834
First of all Buddha who is sitting, who is the deity,

01:02:15.042 --> 01:02:16.501
which is the enlightenment,

01:02:16.709 --> 01:02:20.959
you say: “I surrender myself to Buddha.”

01:02:21.334 --> 01:02:26.083
Secondly you say: “I surrender myself to collectivity.”

01:02:26.334 --> 01:02:29.959
Egoistical people cannot surrender.

01:02:31.042 --> 01:02:33.667
So, ‘I surrender myself to collectivity’,

01:02:33.876 --> 01:02:41.876
so we say: “Sangham Sharanam Gachhami.”

01:02:43.125 --> 01:02:49.292
It is to Virat we are doing.

01:02:49.501 --> 01:02:52.292
What is the third one, is? "BuddhamSharanam Gachhami",

01:02:52.501 --> 01:02:56.042
"Sangham Sharanam Gachhami", the third one -

01:02:56.250 --> 01:02:57.626
‘Dhammam Sharanam Gachhami’,

01:02:57.834 --> 01:03:00.125
Dhammam Sharanam Gachhami. ‘Dhammam’ means

01:03:00.375 --> 01:03:02.584
the religion - the balance.

01:03:02.792 --> 01:03:06.792
I surrender myself to religion, which is  essence of you,

01:03:06.959 --> 01:03:08.959
or you can put it the other way round,

01:03:09.209 --> 01:03:14.167
that, ‘Buddham Sharanam Gachhami, Dhammam Sharanam Gachhami,

01:03:14.375 --> 01:03:15.792
Sangham Sharanam Gachhami’.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.125
That's all. If you have achieved it then we can talk of God.

01:03:20.417 --> 01:03:24.417
Not before that.

01:03:24.626 --> 01:03:26.918
So these three things are to be achieved.

01:03:27.125 --> 01:03:29.417
We would put it in a Sahaja Yoga way like this:

01:03:29.667 --> 01:03:33.709
First of all: ‘Dhammam Sharanam Gachhami’,

01:03:33.959 --> 01:03:39.792
‘I surrender myself to my virtues’.

01:03:39.959 --> 01:03:42.375
All desires can be surrendered to a virtue.

01:03:42.792 --> 01:03:45.751
Is it virtuous to do like this?

01:03:45.959 --> 01:03:48.501
You can, if you are brought up that way you’ll just not do it.

01:03:48.709 --> 01:03:50.125
You'll have no desires to do something,

01:03:50.334 --> 01:03:52.334
that is not virtuous and righteous.

01:03:52.542 --> 01:03:54.167
You will just not do it.

01:03:54.375 --> 01:03:57.375
So, ‘Dhammam Sharanam Gachhami’.

01:03:57.584 --> 01:04:00.417
Then you should say, ‘Buddham Sharanam Gachhami’, means:

01:04:00.626 --> 01:04:02.959
I surrender myself to my enlightenment.

01:04:03.167 --> 01:04:06.125
This is the second state, when you are ascended.

01:04:06.334 --> 01:04:11.209
Surrender myself to enlightenment.

01:04:11.417 --> 01:04:15.042
Enlightenment that I've got to my Spirit.

01:04:15.375 --> 01:04:17.459
Is the Spirit who is going to guide you.

01:04:17.667 --> 01:04:22.834
No more my physical, mental, emotional nonsensical temptations.

01:04:23.042 --> 01:04:25.751
But what? Is the Spirit?

01:04:26.167 --> 01:04:29.918
And thirdly: ‘Sangham Sharanam Gachhami’, to the collectivity,

01:04:30.334 --> 01:04:33.584
to the whole, to the Virat.

01:04:33.792 --> 01:04:36.584
This is the way we have to work it out.

01:04:36.792 --> 01:04:39.292
So ultimately he reached the same point,

01:04:39.501 --> 01:04:43.042
that let me start it from myself.

01:04:43.250 --> 01:04:47.918
It's from myself to others, not from others to myself.

01:04:48.125 --> 01:04:52.626
Is like treating the tree from outside, not from the roots.

01:04:53.083 --> 01:04:55.918
But Sahaja Yoga treats you from the roots.

01:04:56.125 --> 01:04:59.125
First you get your Realization,all right,

01:04:59.334 --> 01:05:06.125
then you learn how to surrender yourself to your Dharma.

01:05:06.375 --> 01:05:10.876
Then you become collectively conscious.

01:05:11.083 --> 01:05:14.167
Collectivity is a temperament,

01:05:14.375 --> 01:05:20.709
is a sense of enjoyment that you get in the collective living.

01:05:21.083 --> 01:05:29.042
Unless and until you have that you have not achieved your joy.

01:05:30.959 --> 01:05:37.000
So Buddha has played a very great role in our lives

01:05:37.501 --> 01:05:41.959
and He is a very great powerful force within us.

01:05:42.375 --> 01:05:48.709
I’m very happy that Buddha Jayanti has fallen here in England,

01:05:48.918 --> 01:05:52.667
because as we say the England is the Heart of the universe -

01:05:52.876 --> 01:05:57.292
it doesn't matter if I say here, is any Arab here?

01:05:58.459 --> 01:06:02.375
I don't want to displease any Arab people sitting here.

01:06:02.626 --> 01:06:07.834
All right. And if it is the heart

01:06:08.042 --> 01:06:13.501
whatever you do here will circulate in the whole universe.

01:06:13.792 --> 01:06:16.626
So if you can conquer your ego here,

01:06:16.834 --> 01:06:22.459
you can even conquer the ego of Mister Reagan and these Russians.

01:06:22.667 --> 01:06:25.584
You can manage that. But first start it here.

01:06:25.834 --> 01:06:27.792
It has to reverse back you see, now

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:33.626
they have to learn from you and you don’t learn from them.

01:06:34.042 --> 01:06:39.918
When it will work out you’ll be amazed.

01:06:40.167 --> 01:06:44.292
Ego is the only problem I always face reaching their hearts.

01:06:44.667 --> 01:06:48.792
If ego is removed everything will be all right.

01:06:48.959 --> 01:06:54.667
So for us the great mantra is "Buddham Sharanam Gachhami".

01:06:55.083 --> 01:06:59.709
These three mantras you must say everyday I think,

01:06:59.918 --> 01:07:05.042
to get rid of this horrible ego.

01:07:05.292 --> 01:07:07.667
Now, any questions on Buddha you have?

01:07:07.918 --> 01:07:15.876
I've made it in a short way – the whole life it is very difficult.

01:07:30.083 --> 01:07:36.375
It’s receding - ego.

01:07:43.542 --> 01:07:46.083
English are wise people, sound people,

01:07:46.292 --> 01:07:47.501
and they must understand this, that

01:07:47.709 --> 01:07:49.542
is a very, very important thing

01:07:49.751 --> 01:07:52.584
that they should not loose these qualities

01:07:52.792 --> 01:07:57.125
and should try to fix their enlightenment

01:07:57.334 --> 01:08:02.542
in such a way that it circulates.

01:08:15.751 --> 01:08:20.751
Any question?

01:08:23.876 --> 01:08:26.459
Gavin told Me yesterday it is Buddha Jayanti. I was very happy,

01:08:26.667 --> 01:08:28.918
because in England I've not talked of Buddha

01:08:29.125 --> 01:08:33.959
but otherwise I have talked about Him elsewhere.

01:09:08.375 --> 01:09:15.375
So now, that's why I wore, you see, a Buddha's shawl

01:09:16.125 --> 01:09:23.709
because it is suggesting of a detached mind

01:09:24.417 --> 01:09:28.417
which has no color.

01:09:28.751 --> 01:09:32.667
And

01:09:33.959 --> 01:09:40.042
there could be a personality which is colourless.

01:09:41.501 --> 01:09:49.459
but you can have it covered with colours to make others happy.

01:09:52.501 --> 01:09:58.042
So when you are a Realized Soul, whatever you do is natural.

01:09:58.250 --> 01:09:59.375
Whatever you do.

01:09:59.584 --> 01:10:01.584
If I am wearing this, now I am a Buddha.

01:10:01.792 --> 01:10:05.042
When I take it out, I'm Adi Shakti.

01:10:05.250 --> 01:10:09.459
Is not a drama, is a fact.

01:10:10.667 --> 01:10:15.918
But if you are not a realized soul, before that whatever you do it’s just a drama.

01:10:18.334 --> 01:10:20.584
For example, this is an artificial thing,

01:10:20.792 --> 01:10:23.167
I put My hand there anything, nothing will burn.

01:10:23.375 --> 01:10:26.125
But if it is real, it will definitely burn, whatever I may try.

01:10:26.334 --> 01:10:28.334
It's like that.

01:10:32.959 --> 01:10:35.459
So if somebody is a real person

01:10:35.667 --> 01:10:38.334
whatever he does is not a drama,

01:10:38.542 --> 01:10:40.542
is reality.

01:10:41.959 --> 01:10:43.250
That's how they say

01:10:43.459 --> 01:10:46.167
that She can take this form, She can take thav form

01:10:46.375 --> 01:10:48.000
people don't understand, how can

01:10:48.209 --> 01:10:50.834
one person take so forms. Can.

01:10:51.083 --> 01:10:53.792
if it is Reality, it can.

01:10:53.959 --> 01:10:56.417
Like the Mother Earh, She is a Reality,

01:10:56.667 --> 01:11:00.834
and the sap that is coming from the Mother Earth

01:11:01.042 --> 01:11:03.209
takes so many forms.

01:11:03.459 --> 01:11:05.626
See Her power!

01:11:05.959 --> 01:11:12.542
Flowers, this wood, different colors, fragrance

01:11:12.834 --> 01:11:19.667
so many things! Is one Mother Earth, is producing all this!

01:11:21.042 --> 01:11:24.083
Because She is Reality.

01:11:24.292 --> 01:11:29.042
It's the Reality in Her can produce.

01:11:30.375 --> 01:11:32.209
But unreal things,

01:11:32.417 --> 01:11:35.334
whatever you make out of unreal things,

01:11:35.542 --> 01:11:43.709
they may look real, but they are not.

01:11:45.918 --> 01:11:49.626
So now, let us have the puja.

01:11:51.250 --> 01:11:52.792
And for the rituals also He said,

01:11:52.959 --> 01:11:55.959
because most of them were unrealized souls in those days

01:11:56.250 --> 01:11:59.918
that they, whatever puja, they did was unreal, it was not real,

01:12:00.125 --> 01:12:06.000
had no meaning. It was giving no effect.

01:12:06.334 --> 01:12:08.959
You see, worshipping a person who is unreal

01:12:09.167 --> 01:12:10.667
or any Deity who is unreal

01:12:10.876 --> 01:12:12.542
or those who were not real people

01:12:12.751 --> 01:12:14.334
and the Realized Souls.

01:12:14.542 --> 01:12:16.667
What's the use of unrealized people worshipping Me?

01:12:16.876 --> 01:12:20.626
I mean I would not allow any unrealized person to worship Me at all.

01:12:20.876 --> 01:12:23.167
You see, I always tell people unless and until they are

01:12:23.375 --> 01:12:25.751
perfectly sahaja yogis, you know then they are good,

01:12:25.959 --> 01:12:27.250
please don't bring them for puja.

01:12:27.459 --> 01:12:30.125
Is troublesome to Me. Much more than to them.

01:12:30.334 --> 01:12:33.542
You see they also feel obliged as if, you see, they are obliging Me,

01:12:33.751 --> 01:12:35.584
they think so by worshipping Me. I don't know.

01:12:35.792 --> 01:12:37.501
But they don't know how much they are troubling Me,

01:12:37.709 --> 01:12:39.709
by coming here without Realisation.

01:12:39.918 --> 01:12:43.459
So the ones who haven't got Realisation are really troublesome.

01:12:43.667 --> 01:12:47.209
They don't help Me.

01:12:47.417 --> 01:12:53.125
So the myth some peple have that if they come to a puja

01:12:53.501 --> 01:12:58.709
before Realisation they'll get Realisation, is not good.

01:12:58.918 --> 01:13:02.167
You should not bring anyone who is not a Realized Soul

01:13:02.375 --> 01:13:04.209
or who is not a Sahaja Yogi to a puja here.

01:13:04.417 --> 01:13:08.167
It's troublesome and that person also starts doubting,this, that.

01:13:08.375 --> 01:13:09.542
Is better not to do such a thing.

01:13:09.751 --> 01:13:14.417
Because also such a person is half baked.

01:13:14.626 --> 01:13:18.000
So no use giving Me half baked cakes,

01:13:18.209 --> 01:13:20.918
and spoiling the half baked cake also permanently

01:13:21.125 --> 01:13:23.584
because if you take out a half baked cake, you see,

01:13:23.876 --> 01:13:25.209
it's spoilt for ever.

01:13:25.417 --> 01:13:28.667
I can't eat it nor you can bake it again.

01:13:28.959 --> 01:13:33.334
So what's the use of bringing somebody who is half baked?

01:13:33.542 --> 01:13:34.083
All right?

01:13:34.292 --> 01:13:38.250
So from next time, also this is out of compassion you do it,

01:13:38.501 --> 01:13:40.584
I know you do it out of compassion,

01:13:40.792 --> 01:13:46.083
but this is not wise.

01:13:46.292 --> 01:13:48.792
It doesn't help Me, nor it helps others. All right?

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.959
So from next time also any time, you must find out a circular saying

01:13:53.167 --> 01:13:56.250
that unless and until you are sure about the Realisation of a person

01:13:56.459 --> 01:13:59.751
that he has got Realisation, you should not call them for the puja.

01:13:59.959 --> 01:14:03.417
They are not good for Mother and they are not good for themselves.

01:14:03.626 --> 01:14:07.459
Because they become, you see doubting or something, and

01:14:07.959 --> 01:14:10.584
you cannot really give them Realisation after that, it's very [hard].

01:14:10.792 --> 01:14:12.792
You remember your friend had the same problem

01:14:12.959 --> 01:14:16.083
who was he? Nick or something...

01:14:16.542 --> 01:14:17.042
All right.

01:14:17.501 --> 01:14:21.167
So now we can… Gavin, you can do the Ganesha Puja.

01:14:21.375 --> 01:14:23.626
You can read it in English.

01:14:23.834 --> 01:14:27.751
Now, I think those who have not washed My Feet before, in Brighton,

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.792
should come down. You washed My Feet?

01:14:30.959 --> 01:14:34.083
No? All right, he will come to do it.

01:14:34.292 --> 01:14:37.709
Who else is there? Come forward.

01:14:38.459 --> 01:14:42.584
Can you put some towel here? [Hindi/Marathi]

01:14:42.792 --> 01:14:45.918
Put one down here, straight.

01:15:04.459 --> 01:15:08.292
Now, you,

01:15:10.375 --> 01:15:14.417
look and she has to... Gavin, has washed My Feet, can she?

01:15:14.626 --> 01:15:17.334
Shri Mataji: Who is she? Sahaja Yogi: Carol? Carol...

01:15:17.542 --> 01:15:21.751
Shri Mataji: You washed it. You've done it, in India?

01:15:30.584 --> 01:15:33.959
Let two by, two, two persons should come, would be better.

01:15:34.167 --> 01:15:35.626
All right? So let's have it.

01:15:35.834 --> 01:15:38.876
You can be here, you both, and then these two can be there.

01:15:39.083 --> 01:15:42.626
All right. Now you can sit there, but just...

01:15:42.834 --> 01:15:44.125
You pour the water.

01:15:44.334 --> 01:15:50.667
Now, Gavin, you say the English translation, would be better.

01:15:51.584 --> 01:15:53.417
Both of you. Come along, come forward,

01:15:53.626 --> 01:15:57.083
and you have to rub My Feet very hard.
