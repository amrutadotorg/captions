WEBVTT

00:09.292 --> 00:13.292
This time when - there was no rain, so we went to the sea

00:13.542 --> 00:15.000
in Melbourne.

00:15.709 --> 00:17.626
I told that would be great if we go to Melbourne,

00:17.834 --> 00:20.709
and we went to the sea and

00:20.918 --> 00:24.292
I made a Ganesha and they made a Shiva there

00:24.542 --> 00:29.167
and they worshipped Me.

00:32.876 --> 00:35.792
Do we have some towel for Mother?

00:36.292 --> 00:38.959
For Mother’s hands.

00:39.501 --> 00:43.792
So, and they made a

00:50.334 --> 00:53.167
Kundalini also there. See, and then they prayed.

00:53.375 --> 00:55.667
And it rained and rained and rained,

00:55.876 --> 00:59.959
it poured, you know, poured in buckets, poured in buckets, it was -

01:00.959 --> 01:02.751
- I have never seen such rain before,

01:02.959 --> 01:04.918
like buckets were pouring.

01:05.125 --> 01:06.501
And in one day,

01:06.709 --> 01:09.667
four inches of rain in that Sydney can you believe it?

01:09.918 --> 01:14.209
And the puja was on inside and outside on My birthday.

01:14.542 --> 01:17.209
Buckets and buckets of water.

01:17.417 --> 01:20.000
And it was a drought, you know,they were so frightened.

01:20.209 --> 01:22.834
Yogi: We heard that the whole tent fell, Mother,

01:23.042 --> 01:26.375
because of so much rain. Robert was telling us, Mother.

01:26.667 --> 01:29.125
Shri Mataji: And the, you see the

01:29.334 --> 01:31.501
Sahaja Yogis enjoyed it so much,

01:31.709 --> 01:33.042
how they are playing the trick.

01:33.250 --> 01:35.417
And then the river got flooded

01:35.626 --> 01:40.083
and it entered into all the pubs and all

01:40.334 --> 01:42.459
and washed off everything, you know, brought it,

01:42.667 --> 01:46.792
you see, as if went inside, washed the bottles, everything,

01:46.959 --> 01:48.626
and all the bottles were,

01:48.834 --> 01:51.834
some of the empty ones you see, were floating,

01:52.042 --> 01:53.626
these plastic ones were floating

01:53.834 --> 01:55.125
and others sank down.

01:55.334 --> 01:57.459
And everything was washed up and was brought in.

01:57.667 --> 02:00.584
But only into the pubs there entered.

02:00.792 --> 02:04.209
So in the newspaper was that the rain

02:04.417 --> 02:07.667
was tremendous, but the river was very discrete.

02:10.334 --> 02:15.417
And also this fire that broke out before I went to Adelaide.

02:16.959 --> 02:19.417
Adelaide had a very bad fire

02:19.626 --> 02:21.626
and what they described it was this -

02:21.834 --> 02:24.751
Can you put it there, this one, on top of that, like that?

02:25.501 --> 02:28.751
And they described that the fire

02:29.042 --> 02:32.209
was also very discrete

02:32.417 --> 02:36.542
and the balls of fire they saw rising on the hills

02:36.751 --> 02:40.167
and entering to some houses, avoiding some houses.

02:40.375 --> 02:43.459
Some houses were completely burned and some were not.

02:43.667 --> 02:47.209
And those people who did not suffer, came to My program said,

02:47.417 --> 02:51.042
"Now we know, why we are saved out of that."

02:51.334 --> 02:54.209
And they could see the balls, can you imagine the balls of fire

02:54.417 --> 02:57.250
from somewhere, I mean they don’t know how the balls were formed.

02:57.459 --> 03:02.792
And big, big balls like this, you see, were just rolling up the hill.

03:02.959 --> 03:05.209
And they could see, you see, balls rolling up the hill,

03:05.417 --> 03:08.959
they are going up, entering into the houses like that.

03:09.209 --> 03:12.542
They just couldn’t understand what happened with the fire.

03:12.834 --> 03:16.334
But the best was the washing of the pubs,

03:16.542 --> 03:20.959
because normally on the riverside they have all these pubs, you see.

03:21.542 --> 03:26.542
And they washed up all these - what you call things used for,

03:26.751 --> 03:31.417
these tanning things, you see, they have those mattresses.

03:31.626 --> 03:34.459
Sahaja Yogi: Those sun lounges.
Shri Mataji: Sun mattresses and all that.

03:34.667 --> 03:39.542
All, everything was washed and brought inside.

03:40.459 --> 03:42.375
I really enjoyed it very much.

03:42.584 --> 03:46.209
And Sahaja Yogis were so happy with all that, very happy

03:51.959 --> 03:54.918
They asked Me a question: “Why God is angry with us, you see,

03:55.125 --> 03:56.542
here in Adelaide?”

03:56.751 --> 04:00.792
And Adelaide is just like Paris for Australia,

04:01.000 --> 04:02.417
just like Paris.

04:02.626 --> 04:05.918
Very promiscuous, all kinds of dirty things happen there,

04:06.125 --> 04:09.125
all sorts of horrid things take place there.

04:09.334 --> 04:12.250
So like Soho it is, you see?

04:13.125 --> 04:17.292
So it was Adelaide was chosen by fire - just burnt them out

04:17.501 --> 04:23.626
So when I went to see the things, you see, where it had started: All black,

04:23.876 --> 04:26.459
– all black things, nothing was there, nothing!

04:26.709 --> 04:29.709
No leaves, not a single leave there.

04:29.918 --> 04:31.959
And really it was surprising:

04:32.292 --> 04:33.959
This house was burned, that was not burned,

04:34.167 --> 04:35.959
this house was burned, that was not burned.

04:36.167 --> 04:37.542
You could see it so clearly.

04:37.751 --> 04:42.209
And where it was burned, it was burned completely!

04:42.667 --> 04:46.334
I don't know how they burned even the bricks and everything, you see!

04:46.542 --> 04:49.501
absolutely charred black.

04:52.209 --> 04:53.542
It’s very interesting the way

04:53.751 --> 04:56.876
sometimes the nature takes its respite.

04:57.834 --> 05:00.250
Like when I went once to Guntur, you see,

05:00.459 --> 05:04.083
I told these people that "You shouldn’t grow any tobaccos any more."

05:04.501 --> 05:09.834
They were exporting all that tobacco to England, can you imagine?

05:10.959 --> 05:14.709
And they had a- in the house you could find all your English tiles

05:14.918 --> 05:22.876
and English - what do you call these old style big showers, you see?

05:23.083 --> 05:24.459
such big, big showers, you see,

05:24.667 --> 05:27.083
you stand under them, then the whole thing

05:27.292 --> 05:30.417
that's absolutely - like a torrential rain falls on you. All English.

05:30.667 --> 05:33.876
And tubs they had, English tubs, everything in the house.

05:34.083 --> 05:36.209
Exporting that tobacco here you see.

05:36.417 --> 05:39.459
So I said, “You shouldn’t do that, you should not have done it!"

05:39.667 --> 05:41.417
So they said, “But you know, Mother,

05:41.626 --> 05:43.918
we are giving it to English, not to Indians.”

05:44.125 --> 05:47.334
I said, “Still you should not have done it, it’s wrong.” -

05:47.542 --> 05:51.501
I think you are doing the same mistake as I have done, I think. One moment.

05:51.709 --> 05:54.042
It's correct, it's correct.

05:54.375 --> 05:56.083
You are better (...)

05:56.292 --> 06:02.250
So, then what happened that,

06:02.626 --> 06:05.792
I told, just I told them you shouldn’t grow like this,

06:05.959 --> 06:06.834
it is not good.

06:07.042 --> 06:11.459
And whether they are English or Indian, you are committing sins.

06:11.667 --> 06:13.959
You should not do like that, why are you growing this?

06:14.167 --> 06:18.250
I said, you can grow very good –

06:18.792 --> 06:21.959
what you call? - cotton here, just like Egyptian cotton,

06:22.167 --> 06:23.459
I told them, why do you want to do it?

06:23.667 --> 06:27.000
Some people take Me seriously some of them got very angry.

06:27.209 --> 06:30.918
When I had gone there about 50 cars came to receive Me.

06:31.125 --> 06:34.626
So, when I was going hardly two or three people came to see Me because

06:34.834 --> 06:37.792
they were angry for that. I said now, I'd warned them,

06:37.959 --> 06:41.334
that if you go about like this the sea is just next door

06:41.542 --> 06:42.709
It will take a respite.

06:42.918 --> 06:45.542
It is going to be angry with you, listen to Me!

06:45.959 --> 06:48.000
And they were so angry with Me,

06:48.209 --> 06:51.000
they didn’t come to see Me off or anything, because I told them.

06:52.501 --> 06:54.959
Now what happened, that

06:55.918 --> 07:01.292
that same year there was a typhoon which entered into Guntur.

07:01.501 --> 07:03.209
It had never entered there

07:03.417 --> 07:06.167
and all that was devastated,

07:06.375 --> 07:09.751
all their crops were devastated.

07:10.209 --> 07:14.542
They can no more grow, no more grow tobacco there.

07:15.000 --> 07:19.042
And in the meanwhile the government of

07:21.959 --> 07:27.584
UK stopped the import of tobacco from that place.

07:27.792 --> 07:31.125
So it was doubly hit, you see, doubly hit.

07:31.334 --> 07:34.792
But those who started growing the cotton

07:34.959 --> 07:37.209
were perfectly all right.

07:37.751 --> 07:41.209
Because all this salty water went into the soil,

07:41.417 --> 07:42.792
so now they can’t grow all these things.

07:42.959 --> 07:46.250
And they said, they never had this kind of an experience.

07:46.459 --> 07:49.000
After that they came to Delhi and asked Me,

07:49.209 --> 07:50.959
"Mother, You must again come here,

07:51.167 --> 07:52.501
We are sorry for what we have done.”

07:52.709 --> 07:55.751
And I said, "Now you see, I didn't do anything, to be very frank”,

07:55.959 --> 07:58.792
I'd never thought of any destruction, but you brought it-

07:58.959 --> 08:01.417
but I told you, that the sea would get angry.

08:01.626 --> 08:04.292
But they said: “It happened so quickly, Mother.”

08:05.250 --> 08:07.667
I said: "Not so quick, because

08:07.876 --> 08:12.667
at least there were eight months for Me to change your ways.

08:12.876 --> 08:15.584
Imagine, just to export those tobaccos to you

08:15.792 --> 08:19.125
and get those tubs there.

08:19.417 --> 08:22.792
You know they have a kind of a

08:23.709 --> 08:26.417
inferiority complex that

08:26.626 --> 08:29.918
if they live like English having tubs and things like that

08:30.125 --> 08:33.751
then they become something higher personality.

08:33.959 --> 08:37.626
But for that they sell tobacco to English, just imagine!

08:41.375 --> 08:43.751
It’s all showing up now, you will see that

08:43.959 --> 08:46.209
everything that I say will be showing up.

08:46.417 --> 08:48.834
I was happy to learn that there has been an-

08:49.042 --> 08:51.417
a program about these horrible diseases,

08:51.626 --> 08:53.918
which are caused by this promiscuous life and all that.

08:54.125 --> 08:56.459
I am very happy. Let people learn now!

08:56.667 --> 08:58.542
They used to make fun of Me and say

08:58.751 --> 09:03.959
that I am Victorian, this, that. Now let them learn what it means.

09:05.834 --> 09:08.417
Now everybody is quite alert.

09:09.125 --> 09:13.459
In England, in, you were telling Me I think, she told Me

09:13.667 --> 09:16.292
that in England there are 10,000 people

09:16.542 --> 09:19.250
who are suffering from this disease! Can you believe it?

09:20.459 --> 09:26.626
10,000 people!

09:31.292 --> 09:37.417
And they used to call Me ‘Victorian’.

09:44.292 --> 09:47.876
Gavin has arrived? All right.

09:48.334 --> 09:52.459
Just I say that hundred years life we'll see.

09:53.209 --> 09:54.834
Come along.

09:55.709 --> 09:59.083
You also giving a puja thing, you know, here.

10:00.417 --> 10:03.250
It's all right. You can take that paper out.

10:03.459 --> 10:07.125
Now, I think we should spread some other cloth here,

10:07.334 --> 10:10.709
some sort of a

10:10.918 --> 10:14.209
old towel or something, or put one of the towels there.

10:14.417 --> 10:17.334
so that this proportion is kept clear.

10:18.125 --> 10:21.459
There are some more. Take the -

10:29.542 --> 10:30.459
take the milk.

10:30.667 --> 10:34.876
I didn’t give you a silver thali, isn’t it?

10:35.209 --> 10:38.250
I must have given it to some other center, I don't know.

10:40.042 --> 10:42.918
From that same shop where they were giving Me, you see,

10:43.125 --> 10:45.667
100% silver I bought, silver for different centers.

10:45.876 --> 10:50.167
I don't know who I gave one.

11:09.959 --> 11:14.167
So all of them are here? Has Jane come?

11:14.959 --> 11:22.042
Shri Mataji: Has she arrived? No?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, she is here Mother. Where she is.
Sahaja Yogi: She is outside.

11:22.375 --> 11:25.292
All right. Call all of them inside.

11:25.501 --> 11:27.834
You can move forward a little bit I think.

11:28.042 --> 11:33.918
But why not spread here something just to - this.
Sahaja Yogi: It’s just coming, Mother. Of course, it’s just coming.

11:34.125 --> 11:39.667
(Hindi)

11:52.417 --> 12:00.000
Did you see those lines, energy lines? Just imagine.

12:03.250 --> 12:06.167
Sahaja Yogi: There’s so many of the zodiac signs found here.

12:06.709 --> 12:10.042
Shri Mataji: Zodiac lines?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, they found them by energy lines.

12:10.459 --> 12:13.417
These are energy lines take to the zodiac?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

12:13.626 --> 12:19.292
Shri Mataji: I didn’t know that. I thought.
Sahaja Yogi: That’s [unclear] and that’s one in this.

12:20.334 --> 12:23.334
So what are the zodiac signs? Which ones are they?

12:23.542 --> 12:27.626
Sahaja Yogi: All the twelve signs.
Shri Mataji: All twelve are there - in a circle?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

12:34.417 --> 12:37.584
And you discovered these by a magnet?

12:38.250 --> 12:42.083
Sahaja Yogi: I think he's found a lot of it by dowsing.

12:42.709 --> 12:44.501
Shri Mataji: By dowsing?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, just with the…

12:46.709 --> 12:50.167
With that? Or they find it by magnet?

12:50.375 --> 12:53.209
Sahaja Yogi: Or they find it also by tracing the old lines of the boundaries.

12:54.459 --> 12:56.792
Shri Mataji: Boundaries of what?
Sahaja Yogi: The waterways

12:56.959 --> 13:01.501
and the boundaries between the current shears.
Shri Mataji: Is it?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

13:01.709 --> 13:04.959
Shri Mataji: But actually, you see, if you take a magnet

13:05.709 --> 13:10.375
it will dip at the point, you see. So, if you follow that dipping

13:10.584 --> 13:15.626
then it forms a line. That’s the best scientific method.

13:15.834 --> 13:19.292
Dowsing also the same thing, it's working with the magnet.

13:20.417 --> 13:22.167
and the magnet, when it -

13:23.959 --> 13:27.626
you see at certain points, the magnetic lines are strong.

13:27.834 --> 13:33.083
Thus magnetism is the essence of the Mother Earth, in expression.

13:33.792 --> 13:36.876
I mean the fragrance is, but the fragrance has

13:37.083 --> 13:40.209
the magnet in it. You see, fragrance comes out of magnet.

13:40.417 --> 13:44.125
Now this magnetism of the Mother Earth

13:44.709 --> 13:49.918
goes in lines. You see, it doesn't move in - eh -

13:50.125 --> 13:52.792
only at the fragrant point it moves all over.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.542
But otherwise it acts in lines.

13:56.751 --> 14:00.125
And these lines you can find out easily if you use a magnet,

14:00.334 --> 14:02.876
you see, a powerful magnet.

14:03.083 --> 14:05.292
Move that magnet on the Mother Earth, you see,

14:05.501 --> 14:08.334
you will find that will start dipping down.

14:08.542 --> 14:10.959
You see, you move it and now you find it's not dipping there,

14:11.167 --> 14:13.626
then you move that side and the line travels.

14:14.167 --> 14:15.584
It’s the easiest way because

14:15.792 --> 14:19.834
dowsing could be could be bhootish sometimes, could be.

14:26.959 --> 14:29.876
But are you sure it's done with dowsing - they are doing?

14:30.083 --> 14:34.751
Sahaja Yogi: No, I think they use a combination of different things.

14:39.959 --> 14:43.375
Certainly this, this one who had written the book had been.

14:43.626 --> 14:48.959
Shri Mataji: Using dowsing. Sahaja Yogi: Using dowsing as one of the methods.

14:49.292 --> 14:52.167
Shri Mataji: But dowsing can be challenged by science.

14:56.959 --> 15:00.459
Sahaja Yogi: And te one in Glastonbury, Mother, was done by an aerial photograph.

15:01.250 --> 15:05.125
The one in Glastonbury was also discovered by an aerial photograph.

15:05.542 --> 15:08.667
Sahaja Yogi: See to the field boundaries, things like that.

15:08.876 --> 15:10.584
Shri Mataji: How? They did photographs, how?

15:10.792 --> 15:13.667
Sahaja Yogi: They can see that the boundaries of the field made a pattern,

15:13.876 --> 15:15.751
things like that.
Shri Mataji: Field?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

15:15.959 --> 15:19.459
It's only old boundaries between the kind of crops.
Shri Mataji: Old ones?

15:19.709 --> 15:25.501
Sahaja Yogi: Fields and roads and waters.

15:28.334 --> 15:31.876
Shri Mataji: Unconscious must be building up that way.

15:32.083 --> 15:36.042
And the old people that lived, were much more sensitive,

15:36.250 --> 15:39.501
much more reactive to unconscious.

15:39.834 --> 15:41.167
They were not so artificial.

15:41.375 --> 15:45.334
But when we become artificial, what happens, we get covered up

15:45.626 --> 15:47.250
with so many barriers that we cannot -

15:47.459 --> 15:50.918
we are not sensitive to the dictates of the unconscious.

15:51.125 --> 15:54.209
And when you cannot feel the dictates of the unconscious, you see,

15:54.417 --> 15:56.959
you start having again deliberations as I call it.

15:57.334 --> 16:01.792
Deliberations take you out, you see, from that sensitivity.

16:01.959 --> 16:05.083
But if you are natural and a simple person,

16:05.292 --> 16:07.667
then you are quite sensitive to it.

16:09.626 --> 16:10.918
You are very sensitive.

16:11.209 --> 16:15.375
Can you can move forward? I think you come forward now.

16:15.751 --> 16:22.667
Just come forward.

16:30.959 --> 16:33.292
Come forward, you can.

16:33.501 --> 16:36.792
Esther you come. Actually new people should be in front,

16:36.959 --> 16:40.250
those who are from Brighton.

16:40.459 --> 16:41.626
Would be better, I think.

17:36.834 --> 17:38.042
Come forward.

17:39.125 --> 17:43.834
The Brighton should, Brighton people should come forward I would say as much as you can.

17:44.042 --> 17:46.918
Gavin, you come this side, I think would be much better.

17:47.167 --> 17:50.542
because you have [unclear]

18:08.667 --> 18:11.584
Come along, sit down, sit down, sit down!

18:13.501 --> 18:16.542
Is that dirty [unclear]. You can keep on it that side, I think.

18:24.751 --> 18:26.751
Who else is there?

18:43.542 --> 18:45.250
Is somebody still outside?

18:47.375 --> 18:48.667
Nick, if you can.

18:51.042 --> 18:55.125
So this, on the other side of Nick also some people can be seated.

18:58.209 --> 19:01.584
It’s a very nice sunny day today, isn’t it?

19:03.626 --> 19:06.042
Sahaja Yogi: Would You like this window open slightly, Mother?
Shri Mataji: I beg your pardon...

19:06.250 --> 19:08.542
Sahaja Yogi: Would You like the window slightly open, Mother?

19:08.751 --> 19:11.542
Shri Mataji: As you please. I think that one if you open, it’s a better idea.

19:11.751 --> 19:13.918
Sahaja Yogi: It's open, Mother. Shri Mataji: It's open, it's o.k. so.

19:56.667 --> 20:00.667
Today is a great day to come to Brighton,

20:01.501 --> 20:07.167
because it’s the day of Buddha’s birthday.

20:07.459 --> 20:10.959
Today is Buddha's birthday, Lord Buddha's birthday.

20:13.083 --> 20:17.501
We all have heard about His birth

20:19.459 --> 20:23.334
and that His mother dreamt of an elephant,

20:23.542 --> 20:29.959
of a large white elephant before the birth of Buddha.

20:32.459 --> 20:35.834
And then it was predicted

20:36.250 --> 20:40.125
that a child will be born in your family

20:40.751 --> 20:45.751
who will be either a great saint

20:46.501 --> 20:50.125
or a very great King,

20:50.334 --> 20:54.125
as in Sanskrit called ‘chakravarti' - means the one who

20:54.542 --> 20:58.709
is the ruler of the whole world.

21:01.542 --> 21:04.167
So the father got worried,

21:05.209 --> 21:12.209
and he thought he must get the son involved into the family life,

21:12.918 --> 21:14.709
into material life

21:16.250 --> 21:19.709
and give Him all the pleasures of life.

21:19.959 --> 21:24.459
So he built a very special place for Him,

21:24.667 --> 21:27.375
a beautiful palace to live in.

21:28.375 --> 21:36.334
And where he got Him married to a girl called Yashodhara,

21:36.834 --> 21:38.959
was a very, very beautiful woman,

21:39.584 --> 21:41.918
gave HIm all the pleasures of life,

21:42.125 --> 21:49.918
everything that he could do to entice this boy away from asceticism.

21:51.250 --> 21:56.959
Also you know the story of His going

21:57.167 --> 22:03.667
one day on the road, how He found three types of people,

22:03.918 --> 22:10.167
and how He felt that ‘Why a person should become old?'

22:10.375 --> 22:13.959
‘Why should a person suffer in life?

22:14.417 --> 22:17.501
and ‘Why should people die?’.

22:17.709 --> 22:25.542
So all these three things put an enquiry into Himself

22:25.876 --> 22:29.584
and He started trying to understand

22:29.792 --> 22:32.959
why these things happen to human beings.

22:33.167 --> 22:35.542
With this the enquiry started.

22:35.792 --> 22:42.167
So He reached a point where

22:42.375 --> 22:49.501
He could not bear any more the comforts and the, all the attachments

22:49.709 --> 22:52.834
that were entangled around him by His father.

22:53.542 --> 22:56.584
He had a son whose name was Rahul;

22:56.792 --> 23:04.501
and He left the son and the wife in the search of the truth.

23:05.959 --> 23:12.542
Now, He started from a wrong end, I should say,

23:12.751 --> 23:15.876
for the search of the truth because

23:16.083 --> 23:20.292
He wanted to know, why there are miseries in the human beings.

23:20.501 --> 23:27.959
And so He started from collective towards the center.

23:28.292 --> 23:30.584
When we see miseries all around us,

23:30.792 --> 23:33.459
many people I have seen, they say: “What about others?

23:33.667 --> 23:35.501
Will everybody get realization?

23:35.709 --> 23:37.751
Will everybody will have this, you see?

23:37.959 --> 23:43.250
This comes from the wrong end I feel because

23:43.542 --> 23:48.584
first of all we must know, are we all right?

23:50.083 --> 23:53.959
Have we - are we perfect?

23:54.167 --> 23:57.000
Are we full of joy?

23:57.209 --> 24:02.959
Have we received the absolute knowledge?

24:03.167 --> 24:07.792
If you start from this point, it’s always better.

24:07.959 --> 24:11.083
Because He started from the wrong point,

24:11.292 --> 24:14.125
searching it from the collective

24:14.334 --> 24:16.667
to remove the miseries of the people

24:16.876 --> 24:20.125
He had to go in a very round about way.

24:20.667 --> 24:24.792
So He read all the books and Vedas and this,

24:24.959 --> 24:27.792
He went to big pundits,

24:27.959 --> 24:34.667
to all the great knowledgeable people to meet them,

24:35.125 --> 24:41.459
to ask them the answer, “Why there are these three things?”

24:41.959 --> 24:48.959
that is the ‘roga’, is the

24:50.959 --> 24:56.083
health or miserable physical body,

24:56.626 --> 25:01.792
then the death and the old age.

25:02.959 --> 25:05.751
He went and asked so many people

25:05.959 --> 25:10.042
And they said: “You have to die because your are born."

25:10.542 --> 25:13.834
And then they said that you have to

25:14.042 --> 25:19.125
become old because you are born like that

25:19.584 --> 25:21.876
and you have to suffer

25:22.209 --> 25:24.334
because you commit sins.

25:24.542 --> 25:27.459
He was not satisfied with this answer.

25:28.209 --> 25:32.542
So He went on searching and searching and searching.

25:32.876 --> 25:36.459
Then He got tired, absolutely fed up.

25:36.667 --> 25:42.792
Then He went to a place called Gaya, very near

25:42.959 --> 25:47.042
Patna it is, I've seen the place and the tree.

25:47.250 --> 25:55.375
And He sat under a banyan tree where He slept off,

25:55.584 --> 25:59.459
because He got so tired of His seeking.

25:59.667 --> 26:02.709
And after the sleep He got up

26:02.959 --> 26:06.792
and suddenly He got His Realization.

26:06.959 --> 26:11.459
And He thought the whole drama is over.

26:11.667 --> 26:16.709
Now His Mother Herself was Adishakti, who gave Him the birth

26:16.918 --> 26:19.667
and She died just after the birth of the child.

26:19.876 --> 26:25.042
And He got His Realization.

26:25.417 --> 26:29.459
Now at that time when He got His Realization

26:29.667 --> 26:33.626
there was nobody to tell Him what it is,

26:33.834 --> 26:37.626
that what it means Realization is.

26:37.834 --> 26:39.000
Nobody to decode

26:39.209 --> 26:45.125
or talk about anything that was to be understood by Him.

26:45.417 --> 26:49.459
But because of His tremendous seeking

26:49.667 --> 26:54.209
and such ardent desire

26:54.626 --> 27:00.626
that the shuddha iccha, the Kundalini itself rose,

27:00.834 --> 27:02.876
but of course the Adishakti blessed Him

27:03.083 --> 27:07.083
and He got His Realization under the banyan tree.

27:10.083 --> 27:13.876
Now any incarnation, which came on this Earth

27:14.083 --> 27:19.834
had to 'samayachara' - according to the time,

27:20.375 --> 27:24.292
the need of the time had to act firstly,

27:24.542 --> 27:31.250
secondly the need of the

27:31.501 --> 27:34.125
incarnation to come on this earth

27:34.375 --> 27:38.751
was first created in the human beings.

27:38.959 --> 27:43.918
So supposing at a time when there was too much of ritualism,

27:44.125 --> 27:48.000
Brahmanism or priesthood

27:48.209 --> 27:52.834
and people were trying to take everything

27:53.042 --> 27:58.000
onto those artificial rituals and all that,

27:58.209 --> 28:05.375
an incarnation had to come on this earth to correct those ideas.

28:05.584 --> 28:09.876
Like Krishna came at a time when He said, “This is all leela",

28:10.083 --> 28:12.083
the puja and everything He canceled.

28:12.292 --> 28:14.584
Nothing doing, no puja nothing,

28:14.834 --> 28:18.250
you just have raas, enjoy yourself.

28:18.459 --> 28:20.501
It's all a joke going on, you see.

28:20.709 --> 28:26.417
So He brought that concept at that time in the awareness of people

28:26.626 --> 28:29.375
that the whole world is a leela,

28:29.584 --> 28:34.000
is a play of God's own whims.

28:34.209 --> 28:35.959
So you just enjoy it.

28:36.667 --> 28:42.959
And that's how He created this wonderful festival of Holi,

28:43.167 --> 28:44.876
which we had

28:45.083 --> 28:49.459
in Delhi. I don’t know- anyone of you was there for the Holi? No.

28:49.667 --> 28:50.417
You were there?

28:50.709 --> 28:52.751
Sahaja Yogi: Two years back.

28:52.959 --> 28:55.334
Shri Mataji: No, but this time you were not there.All right.

28:55.542 --> 28:58.834
You might get the pictures of that. All right.

28:59.042 --> 29:02.751
So in the same way when Buddha came in

29:03.083 --> 29:05.834
first problem was that

29:06.042 --> 29:10.167
He thought that it's better not to talk about God.

29:10.501 --> 29:13.751
Because in His search everybody told Him

29:13.959 --> 29:17.834
the answer was, “Oh it’s God who does it.

29:18.042 --> 29:22.292
He punishes you. It’s God who gives you this old age.

29:22.501 --> 29:25.000
It’s God who does it.“ But what is this God after all?

29:25.209 --> 29:27.292
Why does He do it?” They said, “You better ask the God."

29:27.501 --> 29:30.292
“Where is the God?”

29:30.501 --> 29:35.083
So everybody put every blame on God, as usual.

29:36.125 --> 29:39.334
Even that’s done today, nothing so, so new

29:39.584 --> 29:42.792
and nothing unusual I should say.

29:42.959 --> 29:46.209
So this must be done by God, you see.

29:46.417 --> 29:47.751
If you cut your throat:

29:47.959 --> 29:53.000
‘God put my knife in my hand and He cut my throat’.

29:53.375 --> 29:57.375
So you see, He thought better not talk of God.

29:57.626 --> 30:00.709
Because everybody is going towards God.

30:01.083 --> 30:03.542
Then the people whom He met they said,

30:03.751 --> 30:06.292
“Now I have become God.” He said, “How?”

30:06.501 --> 30:09.042
He said: "I am God now.” “For what? Why?”

30:09.250 --> 30:11.209
Because he could mesmerize people,

30:11.417 --> 30:15.375
he said: “I have become God.” Just imagine!

30:15.584 --> 30:18.959
So He thought that it’s very dangerous to talk of God

30:19.167 --> 30:22.209
because people take God in the hand and use it

30:22.417 --> 30:23.959
for their own purpose,

30:24.167 --> 30:28.626
always say, “Oh this is what the God has to do

30:28.834 --> 30:30.375
and it’s God has

30:30.584 --> 30:33.000
done it and I’m in connection with God and I’ll tell God.”

30:33.417 --> 30:37.125
So He got a fright and He said that, “Better not talk about God.

30:37.334 --> 30:40.876
Because that puts the attention of the people on ritualism,

30:41.083 --> 30:44.667
artificial things, they are building temples after temples,

30:44.876 --> 30:47.250
and just doing all these horrible things

30:47.584 --> 30:53.375
which one should not do. Like if you go to the south you’ll find

30:53.584 --> 30:57.167
in the temples they shave their heads of the ladies,

30:57.375 --> 30:59.751
they shave it completely.

30:59.959 --> 31:01.626
And they have to -

31:01.834 --> 31:05.417
it’s all cobbled along the sides of the wall,

31:05.626 --> 31:08.042
some walls of the temple.

31:08.334 --> 31:11.042
And the ladies who shaved their heads

31:11.334 --> 31:14.584
are just rolling along the sides, you see.

31:14.792 --> 31:19.167
They have to do sometimes 1008 times, rolling - imagine,

31:19.501 --> 31:21.834
and the water is poured on them.

31:22.042 --> 31:25.501
God knows what is the ritual, from where it has come!

31:25.792 --> 31:28.792
So the poor women go on rolling, rolling, rolling like that

31:28.959 --> 31:31.334
and somebody is pouring water on them all the time,

31:31.542 --> 31:32.876
buckets after buckets.

31:33.083 --> 31:36.584
Her husband and her brother and all they’re doing one after another,

31:36.792 --> 31:38.167
you see one is finished then another one.

31:38.375 --> 31:40.083
Poor ladies rolling like that,

31:40.292 --> 31:45.959
on that muddy sort of a cobbled area.

31:46.417 --> 31:49.042
I mean, I was shocked when I saw this.  I said: “What’s this?”

31:49.250 --> 31:52.501
And then later on you see they became modern,

31:52.792 --> 31:56.626
so they started selling the hair, you see, abroad,

31:56.834 --> 32:00.751
so the whole thing became a big industry in Madras, you see,

32:00.959 --> 32:05.292
the hair was made into this bouffant and all they call it, here,

32:05.501 --> 32:09.375
and they sent it to England and other places.

32:09.626 --> 32:14.501
So it’s, I mean, in the name of God ridiculous things were done,

32:14.709 --> 32:17.000
ridiculous things were done!

32:17.209 --> 32:19.209
So He just thought: Better not talk about God.

32:19.417 --> 32:22.626
The first step is Self-Realization.

32:22.918 --> 32:25.000
He was a great Sahaja Yogi I must say.

32:25.209 --> 32:27.959
Because He said nothing doing, don't talk about God or anything,

32:28.167 --> 32:30.709
first you get your Realization.

32:30.918 --> 32:34.334
That was the first condition, establish it.

32:34.542 --> 32:37.626
Unless and until you have established your Realization,

32:37.834 --> 32:38.792
- nothing doing.

32:38.959 --> 32:46.417
So He just started His own method of propagating Buddhi

32:46.667 --> 32:49.751
Buddha's knowledge or you can Buddhism you can say as they call it.

32:49.959 --> 32:51.834
Of course it became ‘ism’ later on.

32:52.042 --> 32:54.334
So all that He started

32:54.542 --> 32:58.792
with the idea that people should first become Buddha.

32:58.959 --> 33:03.501
Buddha means realized, Buddha is ‘to know’.

33:03.792 --> 33:07.250
So "Buddha" means the person who has known,

33:07.459 --> 33:10.584
means the one who is a Realized soul.

33:10.834 --> 33:14.626
So what He says, “Buddham Sharanam Gachhami”,

33:14.834 --> 33:18.000
I bow, no I surrender – ‘sharanam’ means surrender,

33:18.250 --> 33:24.542
I surrender to the Buddhas - means to all the Sahaja Yogis.

33:25.167 --> 33:28.501
You are all Buddhas because you know.

33:28.709 --> 33:32.375
When you know, you are the Buddha.

33:32.876 --> 33:36.209
Now without going into all that nonsense

33:36.417 --> 33:41.167
of renunciation and shaving your head and wearing that dress

33:41.375 --> 33:43.834
and everything, you have achieved your Realization.

33:44.042 --> 33:47.709
It’s a short circuit or a short path.

33:47.918 --> 33:51.792
Why? Because He started from the other side.

33:51.959 --> 33:57.792
But if He had started directly from Himself, you see,

33:58.626 --> 34:00.083
it would have been better.

34:00.292 --> 34:04.751
You see, in practical sense I'll tell you how it is.

34:07.292 --> 34:11.959
Supposing you want to repair your house.

34:12.292 --> 34:15.959
So you have to have instrument for that house.

34:16.542 --> 34:20.042
But supposing you are worried about all the houses of the world.

34:20.417 --> 34:25.417
and you start repairing, neither you'll repair other houses nor yours.

34:25.626 --> 34:29.292
So first you must practice on yourself.

34:30.459 --> 34:33.792
Put your attention to yourself first.

34:33.959 --> 34:38.959
Is also is a method by which you avoid

34:39.167 --> 34:41.042
seeing the point,

34:41.250 --> 34:42.667
seeing the reality,

34:42.959 --> 34:48.167
that, if you are not all right, how can you improve the whole world?

34:48.417 --> 34:52.000
So when your attention goes to other things, are

34:52.209 --> 34:55.042
you must know that there’s something wrong with you first of all,

34:55.250 --> 34:57.667
which must be corrected.

34:57.876 --> 34:59.083
And that’s why

34:59.292 --> 35:02.292
it took Him so much time to go round and round and round.

35:02.626 --> 35:05.209
He had to give up His wife, give up His family,

35:05.417 --> 35:08.542
give up everything and get to Realization.

35:08.918 --> 35:11.417
Because by giving up everything He realized

35:11.667 --> 35:14.375
that it is He, who should achieve it.

35:14.751 --> 35:17.417
It's a very circuitous way,

35:17.626 --> 35:19.709
but you can just say: It doesn't exist anything,

35:19.918 --> 35:23.334
first let me get all right - that’s Sahaja Yoga.

35:24.501 --> 35:28.918
Now what happened, that became a method for people to achieve God.

35:29.125 --> 35:34.375
Many people think that you must suffer like Christ to achieve God.

35:35.709 --> 35:39.209
You must renounce the world then achieve God.

35:39.417 --> 35:43.751
Actually renouncing the world and all that is just a myth.

35:43.959 --> 35:46.459
How do you renounce the world?

35:46.709 --> 35:48.459
It’s myth. What are you renouncing?

35:48.667 --> 35:51.375
I mean in any case, you can’t carry this with you, can you?

35:51.792 --> 35:55.792
I mean, can you even carry, I would say, even a thread?

35:55.959 --> 35:59.375
Nothing! When you come you come like this, you are born

35:59.709 --> 36:02.709
with closed fists. When you go, the hands are like this open.

36:02.959 --> 36:05.250
Have you ever seen a dead corpse?

36:05.459 --> 36:07.792
He always has his hands like this. Nothing can he take,

36:07.959 --> 36:11.167
just going like this.

36:11.667 --> 36:13.792
So you don't take anything from here.

36:13.959 --> 36:17.209
So this renouncing, this ‘I renounce that’, ‘I renounce that"

36:17.417 --> 36:21.876
'I’ll give up this’, ‘I’ll give up my wife’, ‘I’ll give up that",

36:22.250 --> 36:23.918
has no meaning.

36:24.584 --> 36:28.626
Because it’s a state of mind in which your

36:29.250 --> 36:33.834
being becomes -

36:34.042 --> 36:35.876
I don't know the English word for that

36:36.083 --> 36:40.167
which doesn't stick to something, what is it called?

36:42.209 --> 36:48.918
I don't know. You see, any substance that doesn't stick to anything.

36:49.125 --> 36:52.792
I mean we have all kind of stick plast. Yogi: Unattached?

36:52.959 --> 36:55.584
Shri Mataji: No, but that quality.

36:55.792 --> 37:01.334
There is a quality of the temperament, which doesn't stick to anything.

37:02.834 --> 37:05.792
Doesn't stick to anything, I mean you put it here, it will come out.

37:06.083 --> 37:10.417
You can say the soap or something like that –

37:10.626 --> 37:13.584
Yogi: Like mercury. Mother, like mercury, just flows.

37:13.834 --> 37:15.959
Shri Mataji: Ah - like mercury.

37:16.167 --> 37:18.834
But mercury also you can apply sometimes,

37:19.042 --> 37:22.042
you know with heat and, but this is something beyond mercury,

37:22.250 --> 37:26.667
is absolute, which doesn't stick to anything, you see.

37:26.876 --> 37:28.459
You just become like that.

37:28.667 --> 37:32.918
All you do, wear this, you wear that, you have this, all right.

37:33.125 --> 37:35.334
You are never stuck.

37:35.584 --> 37:40.501
Then name of the Goddess is ‘Nirmama’, ‘Nirmama’,

37:40.501 --> 37:43.667
that for Her nothing is Her own, you see,

37:43.876 --> 37:46.209
see, She doesn't stick to anything.

37:46.709 --> 37:49.959
She is in everything, but She doesn't stick to anything.

37:50.209 --> 37:52.709
For example now see the light here,

37:52.918 --> 37:58.501
it’s not sticking to anything, it exists by itself.

37:58.834 --> 38:00.918
It doesn’t stick to anything.

38:01.125 --> 38:03.959
This is the nearest you can say, it doesn't stick to anything.

38:04.250 --> 38:08.667
Any but thing tries to stick it gets burned, that’s a good idea.

38:12.250 --> 38:13.542
So this is what it is,

38:13.751 --> 38:18.000
this is called an enlightened person doesn't stick to anything.

38:18.542 --> 38:23.167
And whatever tries to come very close gets burnt off.

38:23.375 --> 38:29.042
So, such a person is not attached to anything.

38:29.292 --> 38:32.042
But that’s not a mental thing that you can do

38:32.250 --> 38:33.792
that, “Oh I am not attached to you”, you see.

38:33.959 --> 38:37.167
It’s very common in this country especially, “I hate you”.

38:37.459 --> 38:39.918
Then you can't hate anyone. How can you?

38:40.125 --> 38:42.209
And nor can you love anyone because

38:42.417 --> 38:48.375
the attachment cannot give you both the qualities.

38:48.584 --> 38:52.501
You see, because you are attached to someone,

38:52.709 --> 38:56.959
you say that you hate, simultaneously you are loving that person.

38:57.167 --> 39:02.250
Because these are the dual qualities of attachment, see?

39:02.501 --> 39:05.834
So once you have attachment you have both things.

39:06.042 --> 39:08.709
One moment you hate, another moment you love,

39:08.959 --> 39:10.209
another moment you hate,

39:10.417 --> 39:12.751
then you love and you don't know what's the matter with yourself.

39:13.083 --> 39:17.584
But the thing is the quality of the mind is such that

39:17.792 --> 39:22.584
it is either getting attached mentally

39:22.792 --> 39:26.083
or either getting detached mentally.

39:26.667 --> 39:32.501
But actually anybody say, you love someone very much.

39:32.792 --> 39:36.792
Now you don't even die together, whatever you may try.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.584
You cannot die together.

39:38.792 --> 39:41.751
One person has to die earlier, another has to die later.

39:42.459 --> 39:46.709
So the answer to His question that He asked was,

39:46.959 --> 39:48.959
“Why all these things are caused?”

39:49.167 --> 39:54.542
So he said, it is because of desire.

39:54.876 --> 39:59.792
Because of human desire, these are all problems are caused,

39:59.959 --> 40:06.792
like the death, like the old age

40:07.000 --> 40:09.918
or the sickness, are caused by desire.

40:10.250 --> 40:15.083
Now see in Sahaja Yoga language how we should understand Him.

40:15.667 --> 40:21.042
Is the desire, as you know, is the left side.

40:23.417 --> 40:26.792
Left side gives you death.

40:26.959 --> 40:31.501
When the left side is very much used

40:31.709 --> 40:35.667
you get to death, ultimately when it is exhausted.

40:35.918 --> 40:40.709
When the left side is out, desire,

40:40.918 --> 40:44.417
you also get sickness.

40:45.042 --> 40:52.876
And when the left side is used too much you get your old age.

40:53.584 --> 40:58.918
Of course the right side is the one which does it,

40:59.125 --> 41:02.125
but the left side is the originator.

41:02.334 --> 41:05.709
If you have no desire you won't go into the right side.

41:05.918 --> 41:10.459
First is the desire, the starting point is the desire.

41:10.751 --> 41:14.167
He reached the point all right, but He didn't clearly say

41:14.375 --> 41:17.918
what desire means: Desire means the left side.

41:18.209 --> 41:24.667
When we have the pure desire, which is the Kundalini,

41:24.918 --> 41:28.417
then all these things are neutralized.

41:29.459 --> 41:34.042
When the Kundalini rises the pure desire, the real desire,

41:34.292 --> 41:37.042
the only desire, it gives you the absolute

41:37.250 --> 41:40.751
by which you don't get old,

41:40.959 --> 41:45.584
you don’t die and you do not get sick.

41:45.792 --> 41:52.292
Because you achieve that which is eternal, it does not die.

41:52.542 --> 41:54.000
You become the Spirit.

41:54.209 --> 41:56.584
When you want to die, you die.

41:56.834 --> 42:00.375
When you want to be reborn, you are reborn, and

42:00.709 --> 42:06.584
you have that realized temperament within you. It does not die.

42:06.792 --> 42:09.334
That's what you take with you.

42:09.584 --> 42:15.959
Now you take your Realization with you when you die.

42:16.792 --> 42:19.209
So what He tried to say was to build up

42:19.417 --> 42:22.584
that we should not have any desires.

42:22.792 --> 42:27.209
Now because, you see, His passage was like that, He went from

42:27.626 --> 42:30.834
one to another, giving up this desire, that desire, that desire,

42:31.042 --> 42:34.959
that desire - ultimately He came to Kundalini.

42:35.751 --> 42:39.083
There’s a saying, “Ya neti neti vachanair nigama avocham”

42:39.292 --> 42:40.292
When you go on saying:

42:40.501 --> 42:43.334
'Not this, not this, not this, not this, not this',

42:43.709 --> 42:46.125
then you go to a point, when you say “Then

42:46.584 --> 42:51.417
what ultimately left is the desire, which is the pure desire,

42:51.626 --> 42:54.000
the desire, that is the Kundalini.

42:54.334 --> 42:55.792
Say for example

42:55.959 --> 42:58.334
you say, “I’ll have a house -  no, no, I’ll not have a house,

42:58.542 --> 42:59.792
I’ll have a car, no, no car,no,

42:59.959 --> 43:03.459
I’ll not have a wife, I’ll not look at any woman.

43:03.667 --> 43:05.292
I’ll have nothing to do with it.

43:05.501 --> 43:09.292
I'll give up this, give up that, give up that, give up that.

43:09.667 --> 43:15.250
Till you reach a point where you are at an absolute point.

43:15.459 --> 43:18.125
And there you realize that the Kundalini rises.

43:18.501 --> 43:19.584
But I think it is going too far.

43:19.792 --> 43:22.584
Why not start from the Kundalini rising? There.

43:24.918 --> 43:26.000
Is a simple thing.

43:26.209 --> 43:29.334
So Sahaja Yoga is the other way round stuff,

43:29.542 --> 43:31.876
is that you better start from the Kundalini.

43:32.125 --> 43:35.501
and neutralize all your left side.

43:36.709 --> 43:37.834
You see the point now?

43:38.042 --> 43:42.501
That's why Buddha was always regarded as an atheist.

43:42.834 --> 43:45.501
He was not. He was not an atheist.

43:45.709 --> 43:48.542
But as a matter of policy,

43:49.417 --> 43:52.501
He and Mahavira -they were contemporary -

43:52.709 --> 43:59.167
they decided: Let's not have the name of God anywhere near,

43:59.542 --> 44:01.959
because once you start the god business,

44:02.167 --> 44:07.501
big philosophies are built and people just start claiming it.

44:07.792 --> 44:09.292
I mean, they become that!

44:09.501 --> 44:14.459
Actually anybody who reads Geeta becomes a sort of a Krishna,

44:14.709 --> 44:16.459
Shri Krishna Himself, it’s the way he talks,

44:16.792 --> 44:19.667
people - you can be shocked the way they talk I mean

44:19.876 --> 44:22.751
they are Shri Krishna, giving an advice to Arjuna, you know,

44:22.959 --> 44:24.709
sitting on a chariot.

44:24.918 --> 44:28.042
They behave in that manner, you know their style is like that.

44:28.250 --> 44:31.250
I met one fellow called Chinmayanand

44:31.501 --> 44:34.834
and I was amazed you know the way he was talking,  I was surprised,

44:35.042 --> 44:37.334
I mean he was just behaving like Shri Krishna,

44:37.542 --> 44:39.083
of course horrid looking,

44:39.292 --> 44:43.792
but, he thought he was Shri Krishna himself, you see.

44:43.959 --> 44:46.834
So that's what identification takes place with human beings

44:47.042 --> 44:49.751
when they start talking about God or His ways and others.

44:49.959 --> 44:51.792
So He said: "All right put that out,

44:51.959 --> 44:55.292
just talk about Self-Realization. That's the first step."

44:55.501 --> 44:59.751
And Mahavira joined hands with Him.

45:00.125 --> 45:02.459
It helped that time very much,

45:02.751 --> 45:06.626
to all the people who were in the name of ritualism you see,

45:06.834 --> 45:09.000
they would say, “It’s very difficult, you know,

45:09.209 --> 45:12.417
Hinduism is the most difficult thing."

45:12.667 --> 45:17.250
You have to fast on Sunday, because of the sun,

45:17.459 --> 45:20.083
Monday because of the moon,

45:20.292 --> 45:24.000
Tuesday because of the Mars. Like that went on and on,

45:24.209 --> 45:28.209
and when do you eat your food?

45:28.417 --> 45:32.292
If you have to achieve God then you have to

45:32.501 --> 45:36.375
take your bath at four o’clock and do this and do that and

45:36.709 --> 45:40.000
shave your head and then you become a sanyasi,

45:40.250 --> 45:43.417
and you can't eat this and you can't eat that,

45:43.626 --> 45:47.459
and you can't do that - all those things ritualistic they started.

45:47.834 --> 45:51.792
But He felt that supposing if you take to sanyasa,

45:51.959 --> 45:55.459
so half of your desires are finished, you are a sanyasi,

45:55.667 --> 45:58.542
you are doing God's work

45:58.751 --> 46:01.375
and there is no need to have a family or anything,

46:01.584 --> 46:03.501
so half of your desires are finished.

46:03.709 --> 46:06.626
If you have a family then you want to do something for the family,

46:06.834 --> 46:10.125
you have to look after your family and all that is to be done.

46:10.375 --> 46:15.751
But He did not realize that He was a Realized soul, others were not.

46:15.959 --> 46:21.792
You see, if a realized soul does that, it has no difference to him;

46:21.959 --> 46:23.542
whether he has a family or no family

46:23.751 --> 46:25.083
makes no difference to a realized soul,

46:25.292 --> 46:26.584
because he is not attached.

46:26.792 --> 46:31.417
But to a person who is not a realized soul,

46:31.667 --> 46:34.834
supposing he’ll give up his car, he’ll give up his house,

46:35.042 --> 46:36.709
go to the Himalayas.

46:36.918 --> 46:37.918
There, what he’ll do?

46:38.125 --> 46:44.584
He’ll have a hut and have a barbed thing around or so.

46:45.375 --> 46:48.542
Then he may think of a Georgian style of a house

46:48.751 --> 46:51.792
if he's an English man,

46:52.000 --> 46:56.125
because according to them Georgian style is unpretentious,

46:56.334 --> 46:59.918
so we can have, after all we are sanyasis!

47:00.125 --> 47:01.334
That’s typical!

47:01.542 --> 47:07.083
I tell you all our western mind is behaving in that way, if you see,

47:07.334 --> 47:10.250
that we should be unpretentious, you see, it’s very fussy,

47:10.542 --> 47:11.584
is the word they will use.

47:11.792 --> 47:15.000
If you put even a little [thing]: "Oh it’s very fussy."

47:15.209 --> 47:18.959
They want everything to be plain, blunt, you see?

47:19.250 --> 47:24.709
But what about inside? I’s filled with what?

47:24.918 --> 47:29.250
All bottled up with all kinds of rums, this, that.

47:29.501 --> 47:34.083
But the outside should be absolutely blunt, you know.

47:34.292 --> 47:36.083
The food should not be,

47:36.292 --> 47:39.375
if possible just get it in its natural form.

47:39.584 --> 47:42.792
If not, don’t have any taste in it.

47:43.000 --> 47:44.876
It should be so blunt that

47:45.083 --> 47:48.584
any guest who comes to your house must starve, you see.

47:48.792 --> 47:53.334
All these funny ideas cropped up in that - of asceticism.

47:53.584 --> 47:55.792
Then we have other people like Shamballas.

47:55.959 --> 47:58.375
who are going now to Gobi desert.

47:58.584 --> 48:01.250
You see, they thought that this desert is not sufficient,

48:01.459 --> 48:02.667
let’s go to Gobi desert.

48:02.876 --> 48:04.667
So they are going now to Gobi desert.

48:04.876 --> 48:07.209
All these absurd ideas

48:07.417 --> 48:11.918
came out of Buddhism, and also Jainism.

48:12.125 --> 48:15.459
Jainis went to the other extreme in vegetarianism,

48:15.834 --> 48:20.542
because Buddha Himself was not a vegetarian, do you know that?

48:20.751 --> 48:25.584
He was not Himself a vegetarian, nor was Mahavira.

48:25.792 --> 48:32.000
You will be surprised: Vegetarianism for them was a philosophy.

48:32.209 --> 48:39.083
It was not a sort of a thing where you don't eat meat and all,

48:39.292 --> 48:44.375
because Buddha Himself died when He went to one of His disciples

48:44.584 --> 48:52.584
who was a ‘shikari’ – hunter.

48:52.959 --> 48:56.959
And the hunter had killed a wild boar.

48:57.167 --> 49:00.834
And he said that the wild boar has been killed just now

49:01.083 --> 49:06.918
and it will take some time to cook, it’s rather half done, you see.

49:07.167 --> 49:10.792
I mean, He beeing an Indian, He could not eat that half done thing

49:10.959 --> 49:17.375
and He got diseased of, I think, this liver or something got

49:17.667 --> 49:20.334
into problem and He died of that, you see.

49:20.584 --> 49:23.250
I mean, I can't eat half done food Myself.

49:23.459 --> 49:26.209
"This is half done now." Half done is a horrible stuff,

49:26.417 --> 49:28.626
but we eat because it is unpretentious, you see

49:28.959 --> 49:30.125
or some sort of a thing.

49:30.334 --> 49:35.125
People have idea it’s not, it’s very next to the nature, you see.

49:35.334 --> 49:38.584
This is what is coming. But it’s all deliberate.

49:38.876 --> 49:40.834
You are attached inside.

49:41.042 --> 49:44.667
Outside, if you behave like that you are not going to become that.

49:44.876 --> 49:50.334
Like Hippies have an idea, if they live like primitive people,

49:50.542 --> 49:54.792
then they become primitive. You cannot, your brain is modern.

49:54.959 --> 49:58.083
Just by living, you see, wearing a wig like a hippy,

49:58.292 --> 49:59.751
can I become primitive?

49:59.959 --> 50:02.334
I cannot, My brain is modern, you see?

50:02.542 --> 50:06.667
That’s what people don't understand, that we are too deliberate.

50:06.876 --> 50:09.959
And all these deliberations can be only reduced

50:10.167 --> 50:14.542
if your Self comes into your attention.

50:14.751 --> 50:19.626
Otherwise all these are just our mental projections.

50:19.834 --> 50:24.626
So all these sanyasa and all these ideas came gradually,

50:24.834 --> 50:27.375
everyone who came on this Earth,

50:27.584 --> 50:31.167
people have really made a mess out of them.

50:31.375 --> 50:35.042
And Buddha's mess has gone to such an extent

50:35.250 --> 50:38.667
that if you see that you’ll be shocked.

50:39.083 --> 50:41.959
It went into many formations.

50:42.209 --> 50:44.042
But I heard from My son-in-law that

50:44.250 --> 50:46.459
he went and visited some of the caves

50:46.667 --> 50:50.083
where the very early Buddhist lived, very early Buddhist lived.

50:50.292 --> 50:53.959
In the caves, because they were not supported by kings or anything,

50:54.167 --> 50:56.125
so they had a very bad time.

50:56.334 --> 50:58.083
And they used to live in the caves.

50:58.292 --> 51:03.584
And what My son-in-law told Me that in the caves there are writings

51:03.834 --> 51:08.417
in Sanskrit, in Pali and in Indian script,

51:08.667 --> 51:12.209
saying that it is the spontaneous happening

51:12.417 --> 51:15.959
that can bring forth the Self-Realization.

51:16.501 --> 51:20.334
He has got that photographed.

51:20.667 --> 51:24.125
So it’s coming forward. You see, so they knew about it,

51:24.334 --> 51:27.501
the Sahaja Yoga, they knew about it.

51:27.709 --> 51:30.751
But then as every religion has gone into a mess

51:30.959 --> 51:36.751
and lot of funny sort of, we can say the -

51:36.959 --> 51:42.459
funny sort of expressions, also Buddhism has gone,

51:42.667 --> 51:46.709
it became Mahayan, Hinayan, all sorts of things.

51:46.918 --> 51:52.250
But one of them was called as Vidhitama,

51:52.501 --> 51:56.167
who ran away from India, settled down in Japan

51:56.459 --> 51:59.459
and he started the Zen system of religion,

51:59.667 --> 52:02.417
which he kept to the spontaneous happening.

52:02.626 --> 52:05.209
That one was preserved.

52:05.417 --> 52:11.125
Another was the Lao Tse style, who did not talk of God

52:11.334 --> 52:14.667
and of Buddha, but of Tao itself -

52:14.876 --> 52:19.083
the energy or we can say about the Adishakti.

52:19.292 --> 52:22.459
So these two good things came out of Him.

52:22.667 --> 52:27.792
While they searched back into the history of China

52:27.959 --> 52:30.501
and they found out the Adishakti

52:30.709 --> 52:34.667
lived many years back there as Kuan Yin.

52:34.918 --> 52:38.834
And that’s how Kuan Yin was established

52:39.042 --> 52:42.751
as a Goddess for many Buddhists.

52:42.959 --> 52:47.417
Now then Buddha also got

52:47.626 --> 52:50.709
into another form because

52:50.959 --> 52:53.792
there was a big competition between Hinduism,

52:54.000 --> 52:58.209
Hindus of those days and the Buddhists.

52:58.417 --> 53:00.209
So they wanted to form,

53:00.417 --> 53:03.959
for ordinary people it’s very difficult to understand the philosophy

53:04.250 --> 53:08.375
so they thought that we should have Buddha expressed

53:08.584 --> 53:12.125
as He has been and He will be.

53:12.375 --> 53:18.125
So they formed their, you see, as you see He is a Matreya

53:18.334 --> 53:20.918
is going to come, the future Buddha is Bodhisatva

53:21.125 --> 53:23.751
and they started making His statues and everything.

53:23.959 --> 53:26.584
So they made Buddha as the God.

53:26.834 --> 53:32.876
They started using Him to represent the Divine Power,

53:33.125 --> 53:36.334
giving Him forms and things and like hat many things happened.

53:36.542 --> 53:39.959
But Buddha Himself was so much frightened of the ritualism

53:40.167 --> 53:43.292
that He said, “You should not worship anything,

53:43.501 --> 53:45.834
you should not build any temples

53:46.125 --> 53:48.083
so you see the loophole was found out,

53:48.292 --> 53:51.542
if temples are not to be built, we’ll build stupas.

53:51.959 --> 53:57.250
Now in the Stupas they put the tooth of Buddha,

53:57.459 --> 54:00.083
of course that was sensible to do I must say,

54:00.417 --> 54:02.542
but of course Buddha had said not to do it.

54:02.751 --> 54:04.959
And they put it there, He had two disciples,

54:05.167 --> 54:07.501
called as Sariputta and Moggallana.

54:07.709 --> 54:10.042
They were very good disciples of His

54:10.250 --> 54:14.792
and their bones were collected after they were burnt out

54:14.959 --> 54:17.542
and were put in the stupa.

54:17.751 --> 54:20.834
That was something definitely sensible to put them there.

54:21.042 --> 54:23.876
Of course the bones and all these things should not be disturbed

54:24.083 --> 54:26.834
because it’s not good, it creates a problem for the body.

54:27.042 --> 54:31.584
But at least if they have put it there in the Mother Earth

54:31.792 --> 54:34.792
it would have been all right. but they put it in caskets.

54:34.959 --> 54:37.959
Now the first casket was made of gold,

54:38.167 --> 54:42.584
the second of silver, the third of iron,

54:42.792 --> 54:46.709
the fourth one of wood sort of a thing, mummified those things.

54:46.959 --> 54:49.209
That was a very wrong thing to do, because

54:49.417 --> 54:51.626
because if you go on keeping like that,

54:51.834 --> 54:53.792
some parts of the body of these great people,

54:54.083 --> 55:01.417
it can hamper their rebirth or their body

55:01.626 --> 55:04.334
which they want to again incarnate, you see.

55:04.542 --> 55:06.959
But hair is all right or nails are all right,

55:07.167 --> 55:10.083
but you shouldn’t keep the part of dead body like that.

55:10.292 --> 55:15.167
And this kind of thing gave another nonsensical ideas to

55:15.542 --> 55:17.375
to horrible human beeings.

55:17.709 --> 55:22.250
What they did, that they thought that if we have to keep some part

55:22.584 --> 55:25.667
of the person who died like divine person,

55:25.876 --> 55:29.626
why not we cut the hand of someone and like that.

55:29.834 --> 55:35.542
So in Tibet and all these places, specially in Ladhak, you see,

55:35.792 --> 55:39.125
they used to cut the hands of the people when they died

55:39.334 --> 55:40.959
and big ritual for the dead

55:41.167 --> 55:43.417
and then they started going towards the dead.

55:43.626 --> 55:47.125
So they started moving towards the left side.

55:47.334 --> 55:50.584
Most of the Buddhists moved to the left side,

55:50.792 --> 55:56.501
which was absolutely prohibited by Buddha,

55:56.751 --> 55:59.959
because He is on the right side.

56:00.167 --> 56:06.751
He said, “Cut down your desires, do the karmas without the desire”.

56:06.959 --> 56:08.292
This was His idea.

56:08.501 --> 56:12.792
Activate your right side without the desire.

56:13.000 --> 56:14.626
This was His philosophy.

56:15.083 --> 56:18.834
But they - all of them are left sided.

56:19.083 --> 56:22.959
They have desires, not only desires

56:23.167 --> 56:26.876
but whatever they do they do it out of desire.

56:27.083 --> 56:31.626
Like the worst is like the Japanese,

56:31.876 --> 56:36.042
they think that you can

56:36.250 --> 56:42.584
commit suicide in the name of your nation.

56:42.959 --> 56:47.959
With this desire they will commit suicide.

56:48.334 --> 56:50.417
To save their country they can commit suicide.

56:50.626 --> 56:52.584
I mean it is absurd.

56:52.792 --> 56:56.334
He said, “Whatever you have to do, do without the desire”,

56:56.542 --> 56:58.125
which is a difficult thing for human beings.

56:58.334 --> 57:02.042
How many there are who are doing it without desire?

57:02.375 --> 57:05.792
And whatever we do, we do out of desire.

57:05.959 --> 57:08.250
Even at the subtler point.

57:08.501 --> 57:09.918
Even when we do puja,

57:10.125 --> 57:15.125
we do with the desire that our vibrations will improve.

57:15.334 --> 57:19.959
Can we think of a state where it is absolutely desireless?

57:20.292 --> 57:26.959
Only one person has that, there’s no desire, desireless.

57:27.167 --> 57:29.459
The whole thing is done without any desire,

57:29.667 --> 57:31.792
so there is no disappointment.

57:32.834 --> 57:34.417
There is no unhappiness.

57:34.626 --> 57:35.918
You are going to America,

57:36.125 --> 57:41.959
knowingly that is going to be a horrible experience,

57:42.250 --> 57:46.000
but it’s a joke, just going to see the joke.

57:46.209 --> 57:48.542
Without any hope,

57:48.876 --> 57:53.584
maybe it might work out to be something tremendous,

57:53.792 --> 57:55.334
but no desires.

57:55.542 --> 57:59.792
You see, it’s so desireless the whole personality is,

58:00.000 --> 58:01.709
that even if I have to desire for something

58:01.918 --> 58:03.250
I have to ask you, "You better desire!",

58:03.459 --> 58:05.959
because I have lost the sense of desire.

58:06.209 --> 58:09.375
So many times I’ve said you better do it for Me.

58:09.584 --> 58:12.959
Unless and until you pray to Me I can't do it.

58:13.209 --> 58:15.167
That's why I asked you write to Me a letter,

58:15.375 --> 58:16.626
because you see, I can't desire,

58:16.834 --> 58:18.501
i really don't. I don't do anything!

58:18.709 --> 58:21.792
Without doing anything it is happening. So why should I desire?

58:21.959 --> 58:25.626
I really don't do anything.

58:25.918 --> 58:28.792
You'll be amazed, I don't do anything, I don't desire anything,

58:28.959 --> 58:30.876
nothing of the kind, it’s working I am just watching.

58:31.083 --> 58:31.876
Still you are saying,

58:32.083 --> 58:38.000
“Mother you aredoing it.” I'm quite surprised!

58:38.417 --> 58:40.083
That is Tao.

58:40.292 --> 58:41.709
If you read about Tao,

58:41.959 --> 58:45.042
it is said that it doesn’t do anything.

58:45.250 --> 58:49.209
But everything works out.

58:49.417 --> 58:52.501
So this is what He said, which was all sahaja,

58:52.709 --> 58:55.083
that you have to be desireless

58:55.292 --> 58:57.918
and do everything,

58:58.125 --> 59:03.250
and He is the one who controls our ego.

59:03.459 --> 59:08.501
Because if you have no desire you will have no ego either.

59:09.209 --> 59:10.876
Ego is only built up

59:11.083 --> 59:14.584
when you have a desire to do something.

59:14.792 --> 59:19.584
That is you just do it for fun, just for joy, just for doing it.

59:19.792 --> 59:22.125
Then how will you build up ego? You cannot.

59:22.334 --> 59:26.209
Like an artist is painting just for fun and throwing it away.

59:26.459 --> 59:30.542
Creating something just for fun – that’s what God is.

59:30.834 --> 59:33.042
Not with the desire to achieve something.

59:33.250 --> 59:36.125
I mean the desire is so gross, can be extremely gross.

59:36.459 --> 59:39.626
It can become subtler and subtler and subtler. That’s a good way.

59:39.959 --> 59:43.334
But can be very, very gross also,

59:43.542 --> 59:46.751
like some people can believe that, you see,

59:46.959 --> 59:51.584
“I should painting, because I'll get so much money."

59:51.876 --> 59:54.542
Or "I can sell it to somebody

59:54.751 --> 59:58.292
who may be the worst man, but I’ll sell it because I can get more money.”

59:58.501 --> 01:00:01.083
That’s absolutely the grossest of all, you see.

01:00:01.292 --> 01:00:04.876
That you can go to the most sinful things, I mean, I don’t know,

01:00:05.083 --> 01:00:07.709
there can be even worse desires than that,

01:00:07.959 --> 01:00:09.334
can be very many.

01:00:09.542 --> 01:00:12.042
But on this auspicious day we should not think of them

01:00:12.292 --> 01:00:16.375
which are there like that, but minimum of minimum,

01:00:16.584 --> 01:00:22.417
if you come, just do your puja, just for the joy of it,

01:00:23.042 --> 01:00:25.751
not with any desires.

01:00:26.167 --> 01:00:27.959
Just for the joy of it.

01:00:28.250 --> 01:00:30.501
I mean we are doing so many things like that.

01:00:30.709 --> 01:00:34.834
For example, we enjoy each other’s company.

01:00:35.042 --> 01:00:36.959
Just, just think of that!

01:00:37.167 --> 01:00:39.542
We all Sahaja Yogis are enjoying each other’s company,

01:00:39.792 --> 01:00:43.334
what’s this for? Nothing at all. There’s no, nothing.

01:00:44.667 --> 01:00:47.709
Just, you are enjoying it without any desire.

01:00:47.959 --> 01:00:53.125
Just say, for enjoyment’s sake, enjoyment.

01:00:53.375 --> 01:00:56.542
When that purity comes, you see in our temperament,

01:00:56.834 --> 01:00:59.751
that we do everything without any desire,

01:01:00.042 --> 01:01:03.167
we have got rid of all the ego.

01:01:03.375 --> 01:01:04.959
The Buddha is awakened within us.

01:01:05.167 --> 01:01:07.626
And that’s what is the importance of Buddha,

01:01:07.834 --> 01:01:09.834
that He settled down Himself

01:01:10.042 --> 01:01:12.751
in a place which is the most difficult place,

01:01:13.125 --> 01:01:16.042
that is on the left side of your head, you see.

01:01:16.250 --> 01:01:19.584
Sometimes I've seen it projects here up to this point, you know,

01:01:19.792 --> 01:01:22.751
in some people they get such a terrible pain, you know,

01:01:22.959 --> 01:01:25.792
pulling it out from there, can't imagine.

01:01:25.959 --> 01:01:31.375
So this horrible point which is  -

01:01:31.667 --> 01:01:35.417
so funny it is, sometimes it can blow up like that, you see,

01:01:35.626 --> 01:01:38.876
sometimes it can pierce through. It’s a horrible one

01:01:39.125 --> 01:01:42.042
which all of you have developed quite a lot, you see,

01:01:42.250 --> 01:01:45.417
and it takes it forms in different ways and methods.

01:01:45.667 --> 01:01:51.083
For that we have to say, “Buddham Sharanam Gachhami”,

01:01:51.292 --> 01:01:55.667
means: We surrender ourselves to Buddha.

01:01:56.584 --> 01:01:59.292
Then what does He say? The second one is very good:

01:01:59.501 --> 01:02:02.292
‘Sangham Sharanam Gachhami’:

01:02:02.542 --> 01:02:05.292
I surrender myself to collectivity, ‘sangham’.

01:02:05.501 --> 01:02:07.792
‘Sangha’ is the collectivity.

01:02:07.959 --> 01:02:11.584
I surrender myself to collectivity. Ego goes down.

01:02:11.876 --> 01:02:14.834
First of all Buddha who is sitting, who is the deity,

01:02:15.042 --> 01:02:16.501
which is the enlightenment,

01:02:16.709 --> 01:02:20.959
you say: “I surrender myself to Buddha.”

01:02:21.334 --> 01:02:26.083
Secondly you say: “I surrender myself to collectivity.”

01:02:26.334 --> 01:02:29.959
Egoistical people cannot surrender.

01:02:31.042 --> 01:02:33.667
So, ‘I surrender myself to collectivity’,

01:02:33.876 --> 01:02:41.876
so we say: “Sangham Sharanam Gachhami.”

01:02:43.125 --> 01:02:49.292
It is to Virat we are doing.

01:02:49.501 --> 01:02:52.292
What is the third one, is? "BuddhamSharanam Gachhami",

01:02:52.501 --> 01:02:56.042
"Sangham Sharanam Gachhami", the third one -

01:02:56.250 --> 01:02:57.626
‘Dhammam Sharanam Gachhami’,

01:02:57.834 --> 01:03:00.125
Dhammam Sharanam Gachhami. ‘Dhammam’ means

01:03:00.375 --> 01:03:02.584
the religion - the balance.

01:03:02.792 --> 01:03:06.792
I surrender myself to religion, which is  essence of you,

01:03:06.959 --> 01:03:08.959
or you can put it the other way round,

01:03:09.209 --> 01:03:14.167
that, ‘Buddham Sharanam Gachhami, Dhammam Sharanam Gachhami,

01:03:14.375 --> 01:03:15.792
Sangham Sharanam Gachhami’.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.125
That's all. If you have achieved it then we can talk of God.

01:03:20.417 --> 01:03:24.417
Not before that.

01:03:24.626 --> 01:03:26.918
So these three things are to be achieved.

01:03:27.125 --> 01:03:29.417
We would put it in a Sahaja Yoga way like this:

01:03:29.667 --> 01:03:33.709
First of all: ‘Dhammam Sharanam Gachhami’,

01:03:33.959 --> 01:03:39.792
‘I surrender myself to my virtues’.

01:03:39.959 --> 01:03:42.375
All desires can be surrendered to a virtue.

01:03:42.792 --> 01:03:45.751
Is it virtuous to do like this?

01:03:45.959 --> 01:03:48.501
You can, if you are brought up that way you’ll just not do it.

01:03:48.709 --> 01:03:50.125
You'll have no desires to do something,

01:03:50.334 --> 01:03:52.334
that is not virtuous and righteous.

01:03:52.542 --> 01:03:54.167
You will just not do it.

01:03:54.375 --> 01:03:57.375
So, ‘Dhammam Sharanam Gachhami’.

01:03:57.584 --> 01:04:00.417
Then you should say, ‘Buddham Sharanam Gachhami’, means:

01:04:00.626 --> 01:04:02.959
I surrender myself to my enlightenment.

01:04:03.167 --> 01:04:06.125
This is the second state, when you are ascended.

01:04:06.334 --> 01:04:11.209
Surrender myself to enlightenment.

01:04:11.417 --> 01:04:15.042
Enlightenment that I've got to my Spirit.

01:04:15.375 --> 01:04:17.459
Is the Spirit who is going to guide you.

01:04:17.667 --> 01:04:22.834
No more my physical, mental, emotional nonsensical temptations.

01:04:23.042 --> 01:04:25.751
But what? Is the Spirit?

01:04:26.167 --> 01:04:29.918
And thirdly: ‘Sangham Sharanam Gachhami’, to the collectivity,

01:04:30.334 --> 01:04:33.584
to the whole, to the Virat.

01:04:33.792 --> 01:04:36.584
This is the way we have to work it out.

01:04:36.792 --> 01:04:39.292
So ultimately he reached the same point,

01:04:39.501 --> 01:04:43.042
that let me start it from myself.

01:04:43.250 --> 01:04:47.918
It's from myself to others, not from others to myself.

01:04:48.125 --> 01:04:52.626
Is like treating the tree from outside, not from the roots.

01:04:53.083 --> 01:04:55.918
But Sahaja Yoga treats you from the roots.

01:04:56.125 --> 01:04:59.125
First you get your Realization,all right,

01:04:59.334 --> 01:05:06.125
then you learn how to surrender yourself to your Dharma.

01:05:06.375 --> 01:05:10.876
Then you become collectively conscious.

01:05:11.083 --> 01:05:14.167
Collectivity is a temperament,

01:05:14.375 --> 01:05:20.709
is a sense of enjoyment that you get in the collective living.

01:05:21.083 --> 01:05:29.042
Unless and until you have that you have not achieved your joy.

01:05:30.959 --> 01:05:37.000
So Buddha has played a very great role in our lives

01:05:37.501 --> 01:05:41.959
and He is a very great powerful force within us.

01:05:42.375 --> 01:05:48.709
I’m very happy that Buddha Jayanti has fallen here in England,

01:05:48.918 --> 01:05:52.667
because as we say the England is the Heart of the universe -

01:05:52.876 --> 01:05:57.292
it doesn't matter if I say here, is any Arab here?

01:05:58.459 --> 01:06:02.375
I don't want to displease any Arab people sitting here.

01:06:02.626 --> 01:06:07.834
All right. And if it is the heart

01:06:08.042 --> 01:06:13.501
whatever you do here will circulate in the whole universe.

01:06:13.792 --> 01:06:16.626
So if you can conquer your ego here,

01:06:16.834 --> 01:06:22.459
you can even conquer the ego of Mister Reagan and these Russians.

01:06:22.667 --> 01:06:25.584
You can manage that. But first start it here.

01:06:25.834 --> 01:06:27.792
It has to reverse back you see, now

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:33.626
they have to learn from you and you don’t learn from them.

01:06:34.042 --> 01:06:39.918
When it will work out you’ll be amazed.

01:06:40.167 --> 01:06:44.292
Ego is the only problem I always face reaching their hearts.

01:06:44.667 --> 01:06:48.792
If ego is removed everything will be all right.

01:06:48.959 --> 01:06:54.667
So for us the great mantra is "Buddham Sharanam Gachhami".

01:06:55.083 --> 01:06:59.709
These three mantras you must say everyday I think,

01:06:59.918 --> 01:07:05.042
to get rid of this horrible ego.

01:07:05.292 --> 01:07:07.667
Now, any questions on Buddha you have?

01:07:07.918 --> 01:07:15.876
I've made it in a short way – the whole life it is very difficult.

01:07:30.083 --> 01:07:36.375
It’s receding - ego.

01:07:43.542 --> 01:07:46.083
English are wise people, sound people,

01:07:46.292 --> 01:07:47.501
and they must understand this, that

01:07:47.709 --> 01:07:49.542
is a very, very important thing

01:07:49.751 --> 01:07:52.584
that they should not loose these qualities

01:07:52.792 --> 01:07:57.125
and should try to fix their enlightenment

01:07:57.334 --> 01:08:02.542
in such a way that it circulates.

01:08:15.751 --> 01:08:20.751
Any question?

01:08:23.876 --> 01:08:26.459
Gavin told Me yesterday it is Buddha Jayanti. I was very happy,

01:08:26.667 --> 01:08:28.918
because in England I've not talked of Buddha

01:08:29.125 --> 01:08:33.959
but otherwise I have talked about Him elsewhere.

01:09:08.375 --> 01:09:15.375
So now, that's why I wore, you see, a Buddha's shawl

01:09:16.125 --> 01:09:23.709
because it is suggesting of a detached mind

01:09:24.417 --> 01:09:28.417
which has no color.

01:09:28.751 --> 01:09:32.667
And

01:09:33.959 --> 01:09:40.042
there could be a personality which is colourless.

01:09:41.501 --> 01:09:49.459
but you can have it covered with colours to make others happy.

01:09:52.501 --> 01:09:58.042
So when you are a Realized Soul, whatever you do is natural.

01:09:58.250 --> 01:09:59.375
Whatever you do.

01:09:59.584 --> 01:10:01.584
If I am wearing this, now I am a Buddha.

01:10:01.792 --> 01:10:05.042
When I take it out, I'm Adi Shakti.

01:10:05.250 --> 01:10:09.459
Is not a drama, is a fact.

01:10:10.667 --> 01:10:15.918
But if you are not a realized soul, before that whatever you do it’s just a drama.

01:10:18.334 --> 01:10:20.584
For example, this is an artificial thing,

01:10:20.792 --> 01:10:23.167
I put My hand there anything, nothing will burn.

01:10:23.375 --> 01:10:26.125
But if it is real, it will definitely burn, whatever I may try.

01:10:26.334 --> 01:10:28.334
It's like that.

01:10:32.959 --> 01:10:35.459
So if somebody is a real person

01:10:35.667 --> 01:10:38.334
whatever he does is not a drama,

01:10:38.542 --> 01:10:40.542
is reality.

01:10:41.959 --> 01:10:43.250
That's how they say

01:10:43.459 --> 01:10:46.167
that She can take this form, She can take thav form

01:10:46.375 --> 01:10:48.000
people don't understand, how can

01:10:48.209 --> 01:10:50.834
one person take so forms. Can.

01:10:51.083 --> 01:10:53.792
if it is Reality, it can.

01:10:53.959 --> 01:10:56.417
Like the Mother Earh, She is a Reality,

01:10:56.667 --> 01:11:00.834
and the sap that is coming from the Mother Earth

01:11:01.042 --> 01:11:03.209
takes so many forms.

01:11:03.459 --> 01:11:05.626
See Her power!

01:11:05.959 --> 01:11:12.542
Flowers, this wood, different colors, fragrance

01:11:12.834 --> 01:11:19.667
so many things! Is one Mother Earth, is producing all this!

01:11:21.042 --> 01:11:24.083
Because She is Reality.

01:11:24.292 --> 01:11:29.042
It's the Reality in Her can produce.

01:11:30.375 --> 01:11:32.209
But unreal things,

01:11:32.417 --> 01:11:35.334
whatever you make out of unreal things,

01:11:35.542 --> 01:11:43.709
they may look real, but they are not.

01:11:45.918 --> 01:11:49.626
So now, let us have the puja.

01:11:51.250 --> 01:11:52.792
And for the rituals also He said,

01:11:52.959 --> 01:11:55.959
because most of them were unrealized souls in those days

01:11:56.250 --> 01:11:59.918
that they, whatever puja, they did was unreal, it was not real,

01:12:00.125 --> 01:12:06.000
had no meaning. It was giving no effect.

01:12:06.334 --> 01:12:08.959
You see, worshipping a person who is unreal

01:12:09.167 --> 01:12:10.667
or any Deity who is unreal

01:12:10.876 --> 01:12:12.542
or those who were not real people

01:12:12.751 --> 01:12:14.334
and the Realized Souls.

01:12:14.542 --> 01:12:16.667
What's the use of unrealized people worshipping Me?

01:12:16.876 --> 01:12:20.626
I mean I would not allow any unrealized person to worship Me at all.

01:12:20.876 --> 01:12:23.167
You see, I always tell people unless and until they are

01:12:23.375 --> 01:12:25.751
perfectly sahaja yogis, you know then they are good,

01:12:25.959 --> 01:12:27.250
please don't bring them for puja.

01:12:27.459 --> 01:12:30.125
Is troublesome to Me. Much more than to them.

01:12:30.334 --> 01:12:33.542
You see they also feel obliged as if, you see, they are obliging Me,

01:12:33.751 --> 01:12:35.584
they think so by worshipping Me. I don't know.

01:12:35.792 --> 01:12:37.501
But they don't know how much they are troubling Me,

01:12:37.709 --> 01:12:39.709
by coming here without Realisation.

01:12:39.918 --> 01:12:43.459
So the ones who haven't got Realisation are really troublesome.

01:12:43.667 --> 01:12:47.209
They don't help Me.

01:12:47.417 --> 01:12:53.125
So the myth some peple have that if they come to a puja

01:12:53.501 --> 01:12:58.709
before Realisation they'll get Realisation, is not good.

01:12:58.918 --> 01:13:02.167
You should not bring anyone who is not a Realized Soul

01:13:02.375 --> 01:13:04.209
or who is not a Sahaja Yogi to a puja here.

01:13:04.417 --> 01:13:08.167
It's troublesome and that person also starts doubting,this, that.

01:13:08.375 --> 01:13:09.542
Is better not to do such a thing.

01:13:09.751 --> 01:13:14.417
Because also such a person is half baked.

01:13:14.626 --> 01:13:18.000
So no use giving Me half baked cakes,

01:13:18.209 --> 01:13:20.918
and spoiling the half baked cake also permanently

01:13:21.125 --> 01:13:23.584
because if you take out a half baked cake, you see,

01:13:23.876 --> 01:13:25.209
it's spoilt for ever.

01:13:25.417 --> 01:13:28.667
I can't eat it nor you can bake it again.

01:13:28.959 --> 01:13:33.334
So what's the use of bringing somebody who is half baked?

01:13:33.542 --> 01:13:34.083
All right?

01:13:34.292 --> 01:13:38.250
So from next time, also this is out of compassion you do it,

01:13:38.501 --> 01:13:40.584
I know you do it out of compassion,

01:13:40.792 --> 01:13:46.083
but this is not wise.

01:13:46.292 --> 01:13:48.792
It doesn't help Me, nor it helps others. All right?

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.959
So from next time also any time, you must find out a circular saying

01:13:53.167 --> 01:13:56.250
that unless and until you are sure about the Realisation of a person

01:13:56.459 --> 01:13:59.751
that he has got Realisation, you should not call them for the puja.

01:13:59.959 --> 01:14:03.417
They are not good for Mother and they are not good for themselves.

01:14:03.626 --> 01:14:07.459
Because they become, you see doubting or something, and

01:14:07.959 --> 01:14:10.584
you cannot really give them Realisation after that, it's very [hard].

01:14:10.792 --> 01:14:12.792
You remember your friend had the same problem

01:14:12.959 --> 01:14:16.083
who was he? Nick or something...

01:14:16.542 --> 01:14:17.042
All right.

01:14:17.501 --> 01:14:21.167
So now we can… Gavin, you can do the Ganesha Puja.

01:14:21.375 --> 01:14:23.626
You can read it in English.

01:14:23.834 --> 01:14:27.751
Now, I think those who have not washed My Feet before, in Brighton,

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.792
should come down. You washed My Feet?

01:14:30.959 --> 01:14:34.083
No? All right, he will come to do it.

01:14:34.292 --> 01:14:37.709
Who else is there? Come forward.

01:14:38.459 --> 01:14:42.584
Can you put some towel here? [Hindi/Marathi]

01:14:42.792 --> 01:14:45.918
Put one down here, straight.

01:15:04.459 --> 01:15:08.292
Now, you,

01:15:10.375 --> 01:15:14.417
look and she has to... Gavin, has washed My Feet, can she?

01:15:14.626 --> 01:15:17.334
Shri Mataji: Who is she? Sahaja Yogi: Carol? Carol...

01:15:17.542 --> 01:15:21.751
Shri Mataji: You washed it. You've done it, in India?

01:15:30.584 --> 01:15:33.959
Let two by, two, two persons should come, would be better.

01:15:34.167 --> 01:15:35.626
All right? So let's have it.

01:15:35.834 --> 01:15:38.876
You can be here, you both, and then these two can be there.

01:15:39.083 --> 01:15:42.626
All right. Now you can sit there, but just...

01:15:42.834 --> 01:15:44.125
You pour the water.

01:15:44.334 --> 01:15:50.667
Now, Gavin, you say the English translation, would be better.

01:15:51.584 --> 01:15:53.417
Both of you. Come along, come forward,

01:15:53.626 --> 01:15:57.083
and you have to rub My Feet very hard.
