1
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:11,120
One should not feel guilty, but face the problem,

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,400
why it has not worked and the problem lies with Sahaja Yogis and nobody else.

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,120
You shouldn’t blame anybody else for it.

4
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,720
Just see yourself, what mistakes you must have committed.

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,280
Could be a small or big mistake, whatever it is, face it.

6
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:32,120
There’s no harm in saying, “I have done mistake.”

7
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,400
But if you say, “Sorry,” means it goes there [in the left Vishuddhi], straight forward.

8
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,160
No, “I have committed a mistake.”

9
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:45,200
To admit that is very gracious, very beautiful

10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,440
and very kind to yourself for your benevolence.

11
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:54,160
In Sahaja Yoga it’s one of the biggest mantras for all the Western people.

12
00:00:54,240 --> 00:01:00,160
They should all the time say to all the trees, all the nature around

13
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,520
“I am not guilty”.

14
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,520
Your ecological problem will improve

15
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,720
because then you won’t do wrong things to spoil your ecology,

16
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,720
you’ll be careful because you spoil it and you’ll feel guilty,

17
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,800
“Oh, I should not have done this. Oh, I should not.”

18
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,880
But why did you do in the first place is the point.

19
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,000
So now, next time you are not going to do it.

20
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:31,280
So many of our problems will be solved if we face them and correct them boldly.

21
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,680
It’s possible for Sahaja Yogis because you are separated from your being; you’re away from it.

22
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:42,120
You can see your body, you can see your mind, you can see your ego,

23
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,640
you can see all of those things and you know how to put them right.

24
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,880
You are not that, you know, so you are the Spirit

25
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,880
and with the light of the Spirit you can correct all these things.

26
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,920
But this guilt is something where it stops you completely

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,760
from correcting or doing anything better about it

28
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:10,520
or bringing any constructive thing to your own mind.

29
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,680
This will solve many problems for America,

30
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,400
as well as for all the Western world.

31
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:22,920
Same with the Indians, that they should not think that if they are generous a little bit

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,280
they can get rid of their mistakes, you see, they have to face it.

33
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,160
It’s a different style, Indians are very clever,

34
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,680
you know, they know how to find excuses and escapes.

35
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,280
But, after all, it is Vishnumaya.

36
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,760
She will show you that there is no escape, just face it.

37
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:48,560
There’s no need to condemn yourself, no need to, in any way, degrade yourself

38
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,760
or to feel inferior, but to be superior as the spirit,

39
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,040
“Oh, I see, I watch.”

40
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,160
Like I would say, “All right, Nirmala, I see you very well now, ah you did this.”

41
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,240
Separate yourself from yourself.

42
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,800
You can talk on the mirror.

43
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:09,600
You can go to the river and talk there or you can go to an ocean and tell them that:

44
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,280
“See, I’ve done this mistake and now I’m not going to do it.”

45
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,000
You can make promises to all of these elements.

46
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:22,440
Once you make these promises, this Vishnumaya will receive the message

47
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:26,400
and She won’t enter into any one of these elements to disturb you.
