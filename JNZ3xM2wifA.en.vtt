00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:17.960
Of a certain other individual or the
individual who has been caught, what to do?

00:00:17.985 --> 00:00:22.360
So, he is advised in the matter like this,

00:00:22.387 --> 00:00:28.102
first you put your own attention in your own
Sahasrara, this is the first thing you have to do.

00:00:28.152 --> 00:00:38.360
Then while chanting the mantra, put the attention on the
chakra of the person to whom you are giving treatment.

00:00:38.422 --> 00:00:43.320
And also, your attention should be
simultaneously on your own chakra.

00:00:43.344 --> 00:00:54.002
Then while chanting the mantra, you can give a flow of vibration or you can go on giving bandhana to that chakra.

00:00:55.432 --> 00:01:01.112
Now by chanting mantra only for a
time, may not release the chakra.

00:01:01.112 --> 00:01:05.222
So you have to repeat the chantings.

00:01:05.245 --> 00:01:15.016
Say, as you go on increasing the chanting, say 7 times, 10 times, 21 times, like that,

00:01:15.061 --> 00:01:20.691
and you find simultaneously when your attention is
there, you find that the chakra is getting relieved,

00:01:20.691 --> 00:01:27.958
it is getting opened and the Kundalini is
making its movement in a proper manner.

00:01:28.018 --> 00:01:35.728
So, that’s how you have to relieve a chakra while
chanting the mantra, with the help of mantra.

00:01:35.757 --> 00:01:38.257
That's we just told.

00:01:38.277 --> 00:01:44.687
Now, there was another question from Mr. Pitkar.

00:01:50.906 --> 00:02:00.499
He asked that a number of Sahaja Yogis who
find themselves stuck at certain chakra

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:07.346
and they feel they don’t know how
to go ahead, what they should do?

00:02:07.346 --> 00:02:16.189
He says, we want to have certain tips
by which we can make quicker progress

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:18.749
without getting
constricted at that point.

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:28.536
Mataji expressed her desire that she wants to
participate in our brain trust programme today.

00:02:28.586 --> 00:02:31.753
And She has specifically asked me
to convey this message to you,

00:02:31.771 --> 00:02:38.163
that you should ask me questions for which you
want any... you have got any particular problem.

00:02:39.023 --> 00:02:47.366
She has expressed her happiness and pleasure at the way we are conducting, I have told her that we are conducting the brain trust programme as was desired by You.

00:02:47.366 --> 00:02:53.684
And She expressed her joy that "all right,
continue you have got my full blessings."

00:02:53.684 --> 00:03:01.866
I will request everybody that as soon as She comes only the
garlanding on behalf of the Shibir has been already done.

00:03:01.882 --> 00:03:08.044
Let Her be seated and we will continue the
programme as we have continued up till now.

00:03:08.094 --> 00:03:15.084
Only when in difficulty Mataji will participate
when and whenever She wants it being picked.

00:03:15.084 --> 00:03:26.696
[Same explained in Marathi.]

00:04:07.593 --> 00:04:44.180
[Shri Mataji is welcomed.]

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:55.639
So, I was just now  translated the question
that was put forward by Mr. Pitkar.

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:03.805
I will again repeat it. He wanted to know, he expressed that there are a number of Sahaja Yogis

00:05:03.808 --> 00:05:13.544
who find it difficult to take their Kundalini
above certain chakras, say Vishuddhi or Agnya.

00:05:13.544 --> 00:05:27.998
Frequently they get caught at these chakras and he wants to have certain tips on how to progress in Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:27.998 --> 00:05:31.514
How to bring Kundalini or stabilise
the Kundalini in Sahasrara.

00:05:34.618 --> 00:05:46.009
So, I think for me, I have talked to you on a
few occasions about my own experience about this

00:05:48.069 --> 00:06:01.849
and I have told you that, it is very much
necessary first to put your attention to yourself.

00:06:02.059 --> 00:06:08.731
This is the first thing you have to do. If you want to
make progress, you have to give attention to yourself.

00:06:08.765 --> 00:06:15.331
Don’t think about anybody, think
only about Mother and yourself.

00:06:15.367 --> 00:06:19.692
That’s all.

00:06:19.725 --> 00:06:24.235
If you put your attention to say your
brother, your friend, your sister,

00:06:24.235 --> 00:06:28.955
but you are actually doing is, you are sitting before
the photograph of Mother that is actually Mother.

00:06:28.964 --> 00:06:35.675
You are saying that, “Mother, I am walking towards
you and at the same time you are telling your mother

00:06:35.675 --> 00:06:39.197
that see my sister, she is not
feeling well you look after her”.

00:06:39.237 --> 00:06:43.547
So you are saying, chanting
one thing with your mouth

00:06:43.602 --> 00:06:48.762
and your attention is towards your sister and
not towards yourself and towards your Mother.

00:06:48.812 --> 00:06:51.152
So, your progress is arrested.

00:06:51.152 --> 00:06:59.322
That’s the principle reason why people
get obstructed. This is one thing.

00:06:59.372 --> 00:07:19.238
One more point I told you and that is regarding the habit of
forgiving all those who have offended you, knowingly or unknowingly

00:07:19.278 --> 00:07:28.448
and also apologising for any offending
that you might have done to others.

00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:31.352
And that you have to do from the heart of your heart.

00:07:31.388 --> 00:07:40.478
So, when you sit for meditation, you have to
first forgive others and then ask for apologies.

00:07:40.508 --> 00:07:46.328
But after forgiving you ask a question, put a
question to yourself, have you really forgiven?

00:07:46.383 --> 00:07:50.058
And within seconds you will come to
know that you have not really forgiven.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:55.461
It’s very difficult, it is a subtle thing
that you have to practice within yourself.

00:07:55.501 --> 00:07:59.691
And after doing this, what you are doing
actually you are trying to help yourself,

00:07:59.691 --> 00:08:08.051
your mind, your attention, your awareness
is all settled in a proper order.

00:08:08.051 --> 00:08:13.261
And then there is absolutely no difficulty,
Kundalini straight comes in Sahasrara

00:08:13.261 --> 00:08:23.655
and it descends down and there is continuous cool flow
of vibrations from all over body, while on your hands?

00:08:23.695 --> 00:08:30.125
So that is how it is to be done. And I don’t
think there is any other short cut for this,

00:08:30.165 --> 00:08:35.335
that is to be practiced within,
not from outside. Thank you!

00:08:37.985 --> 00:08:53.124
[Same explained in Marathi.]

00:12:13.889 --> 00:12:17.669
Can I ask a question to Mr. Chavan now?

00:12:22.366 --> 00:12:27.029
Shri Mataji asks in Marathi.

00:12:36.794 --> 00:12:42.689
The question is like this, I am asking Mr.
Chavan, he said you must forgive everyone.

00:12:42.689 --> 00:12:50.479
Now supposing somebody abuses your Mataji, says horrible
things about Her and see sort of infuriates you,

00:12:50.479 --> 00:12:54.169
then what to do? How to overcome that?

00:13:12.045 --> 00:13:17.676
[Mr Chavan replies in Marathi]

00:14:48.718 --> 00:14:59.054
Now, I’ll just try to again translate
in the reply that I gave was that,

00:14:59.964 --> 00:15:12.942
I feel that suppose a situation comes across
where a certain person is abusing Mother.

00:15:12.989 --> 00:15:15.489
So, what is our first reaction?

00:15:15.489 --> 00:15:29.429
If you are stable, I feel you should be immediately able to make out, as to whether that person is a knowledgeable person, whether he is realised,

00:15:29.459 --> 00:15:35.802
because a realised soul will never be able to abuse
Mother, never be able to talk anything against Mother.

00:15:35.822 --> 00:15:48.016
That is just impossible, it’s only because he is in avidya,
he doesn’t have the knowledge that he is abusing the Mother.

00:15:48.026 --> 00:15:52.856
When he comes to reality, he will not do so.

00:15:52.896 --> 00:16:04.696
Now, I told that our elder brother Shri Jesus
Christ, has shown us the way in this regard.

00:16:04.726 --> 00:16:09.246
He has said that whenever you come
across any such person who abuses God,

00:16:09.293 --> 00:16:19.987
then you have to tell, you have to pray God that please,
please we have to say please Mother, You forgive.

00:16:20.037 --> 00:16:23.938
And Mother forgives everything comes in it.

00:16:23.972 --> 00:16:27.837
I feel it is not necessary to give him
punishment. I am nobody to punish him.

00:16:28.208 --> 00:16:34.468
It is the forgiveness of the Mother itself will
act as punishment and reward for that person.

00:16:34.463 --> 00:16:39.308
Because as soon as She forgives, the person
will get realised and he will get everything.

00:16:39.328 --> 00:16:43.488
There is no other good punishment. Thank you!

00:16:51.113 --> 00:16:53.455
It’s very well said.

00:16:53.455 --> 00:16:59.925
But it’s a very subtle point you see because God has
given us also temper and anger as well as forgiveness.

00:16:59.955 --> 00:17:02.135
Both qualities are within us.

00:17:02.176 --> 00:17:09.452
And he has not given us temper for something
that is useless, as even temper is necessary.

00:17:09.496 --> 00:17:16.772
Once you are realised, once you are a realised
soul, your temper is also dynamic, it is needed.

00:17:16.772 --> 00:17:21.766
When somebody says something
against God and against your Mother,

00:17:21.815 --> 00:17:27.676
if he is a realized soul or if he is not a
realised soul is a very important point, no doubt.

00:17:27.716 --> 00:17:32.084
Supposing he is not a realised soul

00:17:32.116 --> 00:17:38.975
then the best thing is to pity such a man and say that “Oh
God forgive, because they do not know what they are doing”.

00:17:38.995 --> 00:17:48.327
But say even Christ, supposing something had happened
to the Mother of Christ, now how He would have reacted?

00:17:48.358 --> 00:17:57.617
Then he would have come up as her son and he would have
taken the cross in his hands and hit all the people there.

00:17:57.657 --> 00:18:02.717
So, when somebody abuses
who is a realised soul,

00:18:02.733 --> 00:18:09.917
there are many realised souls, whom I have
given realisation, who have come up very well,

00:18:09.945 --> 00:18:16.246
but who fall out, who try to
abuse and try to say bad things.

00:18:16.295 --> 00:18:20.016
Now at that time, it’s the whole
collectivity is challenged,

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:24.036
the whole collectivity, the whole collective being
is challenged when he says something like that.

00:18:24.036 --> 00:18:28.226
He is a part and parcel of your being.

00:18:28.266 --> 00:18:31.993
Think if in your finger you have some
pain, what do you do? You rub it off.

00:18:35.372 --> 00:18:47.553
When a person who is a realised soul, if he tries to be
funny or if he tries to abuse anything that is divine,

00:18:47.593 --> 00:18:51.499
you have to get into a temper, that’s a part,

00:18:51.499 --> 00:18:56.542
but this temper is to be diverted into Sahaja Yoga system,

00:18:56.580 --> 00:19:01.747
like you beat him with shoes.

00:19:01.791 --> 00:19:05.647
You write his names and burn it.

00:19:05.678 --> 00:19:11.487
You write his names on
the ground and stamp it,

00:19:11.517 --> 00:19:18.222
you take out your anger on them. Your anger is divine
anger, it has a meaning. You are part of the whole Divine.

00:19:18.249 --> 00:19:26.572
If you are angry, the Divine is angry, but this anger is
‘hithkaari’, is the one that is benevolent, is a benevolent anger.

00:19:26.631 --> 00:19:36.021
This benevolent anger is necessary because he is
the part and parcel of the whole and you go all out.

00:19:36.057 --> 00:19:47.037
There are so many ways by which you really punish in a symbolic way. But that punishment brings him out of his negativity.

00:19:47.083 --> 00:19:53.222
But for people who are not realised
also, these things come up.

00:19:53.249 --> 00:19:59.272
When negativity is very powerful and wants
to take a challenge with the positivity.

00:19:59.293 --> 00:20:08.534
Supposing there’s a negative person
and he wants to disturb say our work,

00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:13.204
at that time you will be amazed that those who will
be negative will start supporting the person.

00:20:13.257 --> 00:20:16.934
Immediately, you can pick them out
and say that these are negative.

00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:20.574
And those who are positive will be in anger.

00:20:20.619 --> 00:20:26.414
They’ll keep quiet, some of them will be boiling and some
of them might get up and say, “You get out from here”.

00:20:29.011 --> 00:20:35.331
That we have to do, that challenge
we have to take up and say to people.

00:20:35.338 --> 00:20:41.414
That is only possible when you have
full discretion how to use your anger.

00:20:41.465 --> 00:20:50.791
You have to say it out. It is necessary because
if you allow these negativities to be there,

00:20:50.791 --> 00:20:56.864
they will get hold of people who are
sitting on the fences who are half-baked.

00:20:56.904 --> 00:21:04.834
At that time it is necessary to show your strength, not
to get lost in your temper. But to stand up to say,

00:21:04.893 --> 00:21:08.304
“You get out from here, don’t know what you are doing”.

00:21:08.336 --> 00:21:16.775
That is very important, because whatever,
you see, say, is a mantra, is a dynamite

00:21:16.802 --> 00:21:24.025
that will change the whole atmosphere. The negativity will
run away, but if you say that, “All right, let it happen”.

00:21:24.025 --> 00:21:26.525
It will have a bad effect.

00:21:28.381 --> 00:21:37.651
Christ allowed them to torture him, but not his Mother nor God.

00:21:37.685 --> 00:21:42.562
He took a hunter in his hand when
people were selling in the market.

00:21:42.602 --> 00:21:47.842
So, he has a double side also.
And in you also there is Kalki.

00:21:47.904 --> 00:21:50.801
And you, I have awakened Kalki in you.

00:21:50.854 --> 00:21:56.961
So, you are also Kalki. But you must reach
a certain maturity, then only you can do it.

00:21:56.961 --> 00:22:03.181
Sometimes it is very important, but the way you do
it, with what dignity you do it is very important.

00:22:03.181 --> 00:22:11.199
But one has to learn that also: you have to learn how to say
it with sternness and with strength that you shut up now.

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:17.410
You are not to say a word, and only saying
this will make all the negativities run away.

00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:24.770
At a point, one has to say, that’s what I feel
that when you grow in this atmosphere here,

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:33.701
let you find yourself which is also
very, very strong as well as forgiving.

00:22:33.701 --> 00:22:38.960
You know that your Mother’s nature is Atisoumya, Atiroudrya; She lives in two extremes.

00:22:38.979 --> 00:22:47.496
She can be extremely gentle, and she can be terrific.
And these two qualities you should also imbibe,

00:22:47.496 --> 00:22:52.719
but it should never be directed against your own brothers
and sisters, you don’t direct all destructive forces.

00:22:52.719 --> 00:22:57.694
But against the negativity, because
the time has come for us to fight.

00:22:57.742 --> 00:23:01.884
The time has started now for us to fight these negative forces

00:23:01.965 --> 00:23:09.682
and for that we all must take up strength within us, you see
compromising with them and all that is not going to help us.

00:23:09.682 --> 00:23:15.489
So, the strength must be there, a dignity and with
all understanding and discretion you have to tell.

00:23:15.489 --> 00:23:21.459
But I have seen mostly negative people will
stand up and say, “You shut up, you go away”.

00:23:21.479 --> 00:23:26.536
So, the positivity should reach that stage where you are
matured and when you just say “stand up and shut up”,

00:23:26.578 --> 00:23:30.036
it means something.

00:23:30.076 --> 00:23:42.094
That’s a part one has to play. One has to accept we are not going to run away from our parts and some time, as I said, you have to take swords in your hand.

00:23:42.117 --> 00:23:50.384
So, this is a very courageous role full of valour.

00:23:50.414 --> 00:23:54.674
It does not mean that we are
cowards, or we are weak people.

00:23:54.695 --> 00:23:59.934
We are very strong, extremely powerful
people and you have tremendous power.

00:23:59.953 --> 00:24:04.454
But you have the greatest
power is that of forgiveness,

00:24:04.533 --> 00:24:07.603
but behind that forgiveness, there is no weakness.

00:24:07.643 --> 00:24:17.353
What is the forgiveness of a weak person? He has to forgive
in any case. But the strength of a Sahaja Yogi can forgive.

00:24:18.168 --> 00:24:22.008
So, if somebody says something
against the divinity itself,

00:24:22.048 --> 00:24:25.728
you have to stand up in a way, in a dignified way.

00:24:25.755 --> 00:24:31.948
And use your discretion and if necessary, you
have to tell them that “you are in for trouble”.

00:24:31.966 --> 00:24:33.986
This much I can say,

00:24:33.993 --> 00:24:40.086
because this is also an important part where, step
by step, as you are growing, you will be amazed

00:24:40.103 --> 00:24:48.002
that as you are flowers, you are also the
thorns that have to protect the flower within.

00:24:48.942 --> 00:24:54.542
We have both roles and we are not to avoid
anything that is within us, that is our path.

00:24:54.542 --> 00:24:57.482
But the only thing is the channelising,

00:24:57.535 --> 00:25:01.725
this is very important and this
subtle point we must understand.

00:25:01.756 --> 00:25:07.165
Mr. Chavan is a very, very competent man and
he knows how to handle situations and things.

00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:17.009
But to him also and to everyone, I am telling, if you find anybody,
any Sahaja Yogi who is deviating from the path of Sahaja Yoga,

00:25:17.009 --> 00:25:22.737
you have to tell him, straight
on the face that, “This is wrong.

00:25:22.737 --> 00:25:26.929
This you should not do”. And you
should support a man who says that,

00:25:26.964 --> 00:25:32.794
it’s important. Because all of us must join hands
together to find out the weaknesses that we have

00:25:32.808 --> 00:25:36.234
and how to get rid of them. It’s very important.

00:25:36.261 --> 00:25:42.211
Because unless and until we take a strong attitude
towards ourselves and towards our whole collectivity,

00:25:42.241 --> 00:25:48.864
you don’t know there is such a tremendous force
collected against divinity that we may give in.

00:25:48.904 --> 00:25:57.764
So, let us build up ourselves also with courage and with the full
idea of our powers of divinity that we have within ourselves.

00:25:58.685 --> 00:26:01.795
May God bless you, it’s a very good point that came up, I am very happy.

00:26:01.833 --> 00:26:07.405
Mr. Chavan is a very good leader, a nice man
and compromising and a very powerful person.

00:26:07.405 --> 00:26:11.505
He comes from a community
which is known for its valour

00:26:11.549 --> 00:26:17.689
and so he is so strong because, he has built up himself like that

00:26:17.694 --> 00:26:20.949
and such a person will have patience
and everything he can have,

00:26:20.978 --> 00:26:29.888
but to a point, to a point. Then you have
to come out and tell off people.

00:26:29.929 --> 00:26:32.429
Thank you!

00:26:53.306 --> 00:27:13.428
[Shri Mataji explains the same in Marathi]

00:35:14.077 --> 00:35:21.258
[Mr Modi asks a question in Marathi.]

00:36:59.918 --> 00:37:06.078
This is a primordial question. He is asking why it is
crossed here, see at the Agnya chakra, why it is crossed?

00:37:07.718 --> 00:37:11.028
What is the need to cross it at this point?

00:37:11.078 --> 00:37:15.963
You could have had it straight you see,
so there is no problem of crossing.

00:37:19.588 --> 00:37:25.601
So, I said that this I have done so I better answer
because nobody will be able to answer this question.

00:37:25.615 --> 00:37:28.668
[Marathi].     First I will tell in English.

00:37:28.698 --> 00:37:34.328
You see, the Agnya Chakra is placed
in charge of both the things,

00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:38.412
is one is for Mana means for superego and also for ego.

00:37:38.412 --> 00:37:42.982
Now, how do you control these two things?

00:37:42.982 --> 00:37:48.342
They are to be placed at one point, how do you get a
point out of two things? Unless and until you cross them,

00:37:48.378 --> 00:37:54.403
it is simple mathematics; you have to cross
them at a point where you fix up one centre.

00:37:56.981 --> 00:38:00.533
And this one centre should be
able to control both the things

00:38:00.533 --> 00:38:03.033
Now you might say, why not have two centres?

00:38:03.033 --> 00:38:06.393
Because see, they are so interdependent.

00:38:06.432 --> 00:38:14.233
If you raise ego your superego goes down. If
you raise your superego, the ego goes down.

00:38:14.233 --> 00:38:22.058
So, they are so interconnected that it has to be one point by
which you can control both of them and put them in the balance.

00:38:22.088 --> 00:38:26.518
Now, another problem is that if it is
crossed, you see we are not stopped by that.

00:38:26.562 --> 00:38:32.515
The basic problem is that how to control both
these things, and that’s why it is placed here

00:38:32.515 --> 00:38:41.272
but you must know that this crossing does not stop your movement of the Kundalini. Because Kundalini rises in the centre,

00:38:41.272 --> 00:38:52.690
not on the sides. When these two are crossing,
the centre in between here is inside the thing.

00:38:52.690 --> 00:39:01.690
Say, for example, there is a crossing between the two bores
and both the bores become, here, open like this, like this,

00:39:01.732 --> 00:39:03.713
so it can always open, no problem.

00:39:03.726 --> 00:39:08.593
But the communication is there, that's all, the
communications is there, but this opens out properly,

00:39:08.593 --> 00:39:11.813
but why this is closed is the point.

00:39:11.813 --> 00:39:19.253
It is closed because of the extremes of one, of another.
This is closed because this one is more or this one is more.

00:39:19.253 --> 00:39:27.753
Now, if you can somehow reduce the pressure and
bring them into a balanced way then this opens out.

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:30.300
Now, how do you do it? It's very simple,

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:33.803
that supposing your ego is more, what
do you do? Left side to right side,

00:39:33.832 --> 00:39:39.629
right you do seven times. And now see for yourself
raising your Kundalini if Agnya opens or not?

00:39:39.629 --> 00:39:44.372
Supposing your superego is more, you can feel
it. Then you raise your right to your left down.

00:39:44.391 --> 00:39:49.504
Right? Now you balance it and
so that the aperture opens out.

00:39:49.504 --> 00:39:57.851
When it is in balance, it opens out automatically. That’s
why it is crossed, otherwise you cannot control it.

00:40:06.533 --> 00:40:20.344
[Shri Mataji explains in Marathi]

00:42:29.798 --> 00:42:36.586
This is opened like this. When it is in balance it opens like
this. When it is in imbalance it goes like this or like that.

00:42:36.932 --> 00:42:44.021
Both the time it closes down. So only by closing it down, you will
know, whether it is... which side it is, otherwise you would not know.

00:42:45.631 --> 00:42:48.512
There are so many ways by which you
can open it also, you know that.

00:42:48.521 --> 00:43:00.061
If it is the superego, you know which mantras to be said. If it is ego you know what to say? How to raise it? How to get rid of your ego? How to get rid of your superego.

00:43:12.485 --> 00:43:16.475
Yes.  Come here, come here, come here.

00:43:25.098 --> 00:43:41.694
My question is when we are just beginning to be in Sahaja Yoga and we are just beginning to cleansing ourselves, I am very, I don’t really know how I have to behave myself.

00:43:41.730 --> 00:43:42.684
Behave?

00:43:42.675 --> 00:43:53.336
to behave myself, means how I have to act when I don’t know.So for example when I am, do I have to work on people already and for this problem,

00:43:53.380 --> 00:44:04.006
I can feel that I can catch really easily negativity from people, even when I do bandhan and all the advice. And that’s all.

00:44:06.816 --> 00:44:09.316
Whom you want to ask this question?

00:44:09.316 --> 00:44:11.816
Warren.

00:44:29.461 --> 00:44:46.537
[Shri Mataji explains the question in Marathi]

00:44:54.959 --> 00:45:04.259
If I follow the question correctly, he is wanting to know how we deal with a person when we are giving awakening and self-realisation,

00:45:04.281 --> 00:45:17.441
particularly as it relates to problems of we younger Sahaja Yogis who are prone to catch, prone to maybe get a little caught up from these problems. Am I correct Mother, is this the question

00:45:17.458 --> 00:45:19.528
Am I correct Mother, is this the question?

00:45:19.528 --> 00:45:20.838
Yes, it is.

00:45:20.838 --> 00:45:27.634
So, what we have found in Australia and I
can only speak from my own experience, is

00:45:27.664 --> 00:45:38.324
that first, we pray to the Mother that we will have the
strength to be the transmitter of these divine vibrations

00:45:38.382 --> 00:45:48.732
and the way we do this is as you know to first of all put bandhan around ourself, to protect ourself and bandhan around the other person.

00:45:48.732 --> 00:45:51.892
This is simple, we know this.

00:45:51.892 --> 00:46:01.743
And then of course to put our attention on
Sahasrara. So that our Chitta is correct

00:46:01.794 --> 00:46:15.453
and then ask of the unconscious where that person is catching by using the very simple device which Mother has given us

00:46:15.453 --> 00:46:26.310
of asking and then our own Kundalini
comes to that chakra within our own being

00:46:26.344 --> 00:46:33.902
and then we put a bandhan to that chakra and in
so doing we are putting ourself in collectivity.

00:46:33.932 --> 00:46:42.532
And by collectivity, we are able to remove the
blockage or the badha or whatever the problem is.

00:46:42.588 --> 00:46:54.111
But of course, this depends upon how strong
the Kundalini is in the person who is giving,

00:46:54.138 --> 00:47:00.131
how strong the Kundalini is in the person who is working on that person

00:47:00.173 --> 00:47:10.733
it depends upon how much the antaryoga is working,
how much the inner yoga is working within that person,

00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:28.116
how strong the desire from Mooladhara is working, how much it is reflected on Sahasrara, how far we are growing as Sahaja Yogis.

00:47:28.173 --> 00:47:30.998
And so we will find that every case is different,

00:47:31.023 --> 00:47:44.897
but one thing is for sure that as you grow, as you surrender to the Mother, as your attention seats itself on Sahasrara,

00:47:44.939 --> 00:47:51.694
one thing is absolutely certain that you will
catch less and less and less as the time goes by

00:47:51.694 --> 00:48:00.267
and your confidence will grow. And as your confidence grows,
the seat of the spirit at Sahasrara will become more permanent.

00:48:00.309 --> 00:48:07.731
The Ganesha shakti will grow, Kundalini will rise with
greater force, the tendency to catch will diminish

00:48:07.731 --> 00:48:16.409
and all of these things which we've all experienced. Every one of us has experienced these very things that you speak of Alexander, it is a real problem.

00:48:17.009 --> 00:48:19.749
But it is a problem which is able to be solved

00:48:19.749 --> 00:48:31.499
and it is solved by the grace of our Mother, who as time goes by, as She nurtures Her children and as we grow in knowledge, and joy and love,

00:48:31.529 --> 00:48:36.400
So, to all of these things just happen,
they just happen in a Sahaj way.

00:48:36.441 --> 00:48:48.835
So, a little patience, a little time and you will find
that the confidences displayed by Dhumal, by Chavan.

00:48:48.892 --> 00:48:54.041
Just put your attention on other person
and it just happens, that’s all they do.

00:48:54.061 --> 00:49:01.642
We have to do a little more but with time it does grow. So be
patient, learn the little tricks that Mother has taught us,

00:49:01.664 --> 00:49:11.946
do the things that we know we should do and very soon if you keep your attention here and you surrender to the Mother, it will all work out.

00:49:11.935 --> 00:49:23.035
This is what we keep saying to people in Australia, it will all work out but it is rather remarkable in every case this phrase became almost one with which was hackneyed.

00:49:23.076 --> 00:49:27.026
But in an incredible way it has worked out.

00:49:27.476 --> 00:49:29.976
Thank you! Jai Mataji.

00:49:42.376 --> 00:49:56.086
It’s a very simple thing, which is sort of still you people are not knowing one thing for definite that you do not catch from anyone, when you give realisation to anyone.

00:49:56.106 --> 00:50:04.746
It’s a myth. It’s just a myth. You feel you are catching from another person, actually it is you who is the one who is showing the catches.

00:50:04.779 --> 00:50:11.722
It is you who has the weaknesses. You will never
catch from anybody else because it is given in purity.

00:50:11.721 --> 00:50:18.262
You know even the name of your Mother means immaculate and it’s an immaculate awakening you give to the other person.

00:50:18.262 --> 00:50:24.496
The difference is that because a
western mind thinks about it too much,

00:50:24.526 --> 00:50:32.466
that’s when it catches. You just go on giving realisation, just you will never catch, you cannot catch that’s my guarantee to you.

00:50:32.466 --> 00:50:40.037
But you catch only because when you are
giving realisation you are thinking about it.

00:50:40.037 --> 00:50:44.746
You do not do it in thoughtless awareness.
You should do it in thoughtless awareness,

00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:49.739
this is not your brother, this is not your
sister, this is no one, you are not interested.

00:50:49.770 --> 00:50:58.587
When you get interested in a person like she is your sister, he is brother, he must get it, must happen to your mother, must happen to your father, you are interested in people.

00:50:58.587 --> 00:51:02.963
This must happen to this
one or that one, finished.

00:51:03.004 --> 00:51:07.587
Because they are part and parcel of
you and their weaknesses show in you.

00:51:07.612 --> 00:51:12.777
But if you are not interested and involved into a person, you will never catch. No question!

00:51:12.823 --> 00:51:18.341
It’s so beautiful, you just raise your hands.
But because you think about it all the time...

00:51:18.424 --> 00:51:28.586
See take a question of Mr. X, you see, who is thinking that  he has problems. You have no problems at all, it’s a myth, it’s a myth.

00:51:28.615 --> 00:51:34.186
All your problems are nothing but myths, do you know
that? These are all myths and you have to go beyond it.

00:51:34.220 --> 00:51:38.176
This is what Kundalini is doing is
taking you out of all your myths.

00:51:38.216 --> 00:51:42.036
You have no problems.

00:51:42.045 --> 00:51:47.946
It’s just that sometimes the superego has come up,
sometimes ego has come up. Push them down, finished.

00:51:48.014 --> 00:51:53.270
You are beyond. You have gone beyond it.

00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:57.364
Now when you catch, you see you are
thinking,oh you have this problem,

00:51:57.364 --> 00:52:07.710
this has happened to you. This is your past problem, future problems. This problem or that problem. You have no problems. First of all, know within yourself you have no problems.

00:52:07.706 --> 00:52:12.100
Now you have become lights, you have
to solve the problem of others.

00:52:12.105 --> 00:52:14.100
You have no problems at all.

00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:17.230
Now raising the Kundalini, nobody should catch.

00:52:17.230 --> 00:52:26.850
There is no need to give even bandhan I would say. But, supposing you think you have to give bandhan, don’t show your weakness, see somebody is sitting before you, you show him weaknesses.

00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:36.559
There is nothing to be afraid of, the fear,
the little bit of fear within you will catch.

00:52:36.610 --> 00:52:40.680
It is the lack now within you which
catches. It is your weakness that catches.

00:52:42.076 --> 00:52:53.192
Just go ahead with it, but it doesn’t also mean that you have with your ego. You see, some people have an ego, "Oh, how can I not give him realisation?" That also is an attachment.

00:52:53.198 --> 00:52:57.912
All right, we tried, it doesn’t
work out get out, finished.

00:52:57.935 --> 00:53:03.475
This is the other side of it, you see I must give realisation
to my mother, I must give realisation to my father.

00:53:03.528 --> 00:53:08.895
First attachment is like that, why? Who are
they to you? Who are your brothers and sisters?

00:53:08.933 --> 00:53:16.563
Just forget it. You are people who are seekers. You are a category, they are not that category, if they were, they would have come to you.

00:53:16.601 --> 00:53:20.643
Go and seek outside on the streets,
go and find out the seekers.

00:53:20.692 --> 00:53:26.343
I don’t give it to My children, I don’t give it
to anyone, you know that. I am not interested.

00:53:26.363 --> 00:53:36.209
All right, I have relationships, finished. But I am not bothered as far as their realisation is concerned. Those who deserve, those who are of the category you give them Realisation.

00:53:36.209 --> 00:53:43.639
But you will catch hold of a person who
is a very dear and near according to you,

00:53:43.679 --> 00:53:51.008
then you give realisation to that person and that dear
and near comes back like a scorpion and it catches you.

00:53:51.008 --> 00:53:56.509
Then you say I am caught up. No, you don’t give
realisation to anybody who is known to you, finished.

00:53:56.545 --> 00:54:02.557
Interested in your child, in your wife, in your
mother, in your brother, they are not seekers.

00:54:02.557 --> 00:54:05.895
They have nothing to do with you.

00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:07.820
Just forget them.

00:54:07.841 --> 00:54:10.534
Give realisation to seekers,

00:54:10.571 --> 00:54:13.870
and not to people who are not seekers.
Then you will not have any problems.

00:54:13.911 --> 00:54:19.351
Then ego problem comes up when the seekers who
are not seekers you try to give them realisation,

00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:28.091
you will say, “Oh God, the Kundalini doesn’t rise”. Oh, drop,
drop their back, do this, beat them, raise it, then you catch.

00:54:28.084 --> 00:54:30.584
That's ego, you are catching on your ego

00:54:30.584 --> 00:54:39.754
and when you get frightened of somebody, you see a person whom you give realisation, suddenly you find that person shaking too much and then say let it be, I have nothing to do with you.

00:54:39.754 --> 00:54:42.409
I cannot give you realisation, finished.

00:54:42.439 --> 00:54:46.979
You better sit before Mother’s photograph;
you see if you can get realisation from Her.

00:54:47.008 --> 00:54:52.399
There are people, I have seen, they said, “We will not
take Mother’s photograph, but you give us realisation”.

00:54:52.435 --> 00:54:55.678
You should say, “If you don’t want to take Mother’s
photograph, we have nothing to do with you.

00:54:55.706 --> 00:55:00.038
Who are you? We don’t know you. You work
on Mother’s photograph first of all."

00:55:00.048 --> 00:55:04.258
Let them develop that dedication for your
Mother. Why should you give them realisation?

00:55:04.258 --> 00:55:08.478
How am I related to them?
How am I obliged to them?

00:55:08.504 --> 00:55:10.748
I am obliged to you, not to them.

00:55:10.764 --> 00:55:18.488
So, do not force things on people, just give realisation to people
who are seekers, who are seeking, who have respect for your Mother.

00:55:18.488 --> 00:55:21.396
You see you will never catch.

00:55:21.445 --> 00:55:29.368
Because if you are forcing, you are forcing because of your ego. If you are running away it is because of your superego and you catch on these two things.

00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:33.640
But you are just doing it because you are light, You're just throwing light, who can catch?

00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:36.844
Can this light catch any
darkness because it is there,

00:55:36.870 --> 00:55:38.644
because there is darkness around, will it?

00:55:38.677 --> 00:55:47.461
When this little light cannot do it, then how can you the ones who are given the Ganesha power by your Mother, how can you catch?

00:55:47.461 --> 00:55:51.526
You are Ganeshas, do you know
that? You are very powerful.

00:55:51.546 --> 00:55:55.006
The only thing is, you shouldn’t
have weaknesses for the others.

00:55:55.050 --> 00:55:59.046
It is only your weakness that catches,
never the weakness of another person.

00:55:59.087 --> 00:56:07.480
Nobody can catch you. I have not made
boobies here, just dainty darlings. No!

00:56:11.244 --> 00:56:14.104
You raise your hands and
you will see that they....

00:56:14.104 --> 00:56:24.494
But don’t run after useless people, third raters, there are, there must be many people who are real seekers, work out with them, alright?

00:56:24.549 --> 00:56:27.049
[Inaudible question]

00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:33.390
What, you catch between Sahaja Yogis also?

00:56:33.390 --> 00:56:35.890
What did you say?

00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:47.288
[Inaudible]

00:56:48.524 --> 00:56:51.024
But one thing, you have no problem.

00:56:51.065 --> 00:56:53.565
[Inaudible]

00:56:56.296 --> 00:57:00.396
You see if any Sahaja Yogi comes with his
problem to you, you tell him you have no problem.

00:57:02.166 --> 00:57:10.076
Just tell them, you see this is a style which western people
have. They all have problems for nothing at all. Les Miserables!

00:57:10.126 --> 00:57:13.636
Les Miserables!

00:57:13.672 --> 00:57:18.002
This is all due to thinking. You have no
problems. What problems do you have?

00:57:18.002 --> 00:57:22.372
You have to solve the problems of the whole
world, still you are sitting with your problems?

00:57:24.317 --> 00:57:25.847
You are the swimmers.

00:57:25.847 --> 00:57:29.197
The swimmers don’t have problems, you have
to save people who are getting drowned.

00:57:29.197 --> 00:57:31.697
Now the swimmers are saying we
have problems, how to save?

00:57:31.699 --> 00:57:37.867
It’s a question like that? You have no
problems; you have no problems. Just forget it,

00:57:37.897 --> 00:57:41.367
you are put above problems, beyond.

00:57:41.405 --> 00:57:46.407
Believe me, believe me, believe me. All
right, all right. Keep to that, all right.

00:57:46.415 --> 00:57:48.915
[Inaudible]

00:57:52.133 --> 00:57:54.906
Yes, if he wants you, if he wants you to help him.

00:57:54.906 --> 00:58:00.646
You should. Actually, most of the Sahaja
Yogis suffer from over vibrations.

00:58:03.384 --> 00:58:11.294
Yes, you see always if a Sahaja Yogi says this is paining, you just catch hold of his hand and put it down like that and he will be all right,

00:58:11.333 --> 00:58:15.484
just like that. They all suffer from over
vibrations, because you don’t give it to others.

00:58:15.490 --> 00:58:19.705
Give it, please give it to everyone.
I don’t know, you suffer from that.

00:58:19.705 --> 00:58:24.699
Any pain you have anywhere, you ask somebody to
put your hand there and take it out, finished.

00:58:26.395 --> 00:58:31.865
You, most of you suffer from over vibrations. I
haven’t seen anybody suffering from less vibrations.

00:58:31.886 --> 00:58:35.665
I have yet to come across one.

00:58:35.715 --> 00:58:39.318
You have so much vibrations
that you are not aware of it.

00:58:39.348 --> 00:58:44.728
One of you can give realisation
to 10,000 people. Even in Paris!

00:58:48.848 --> 00:58:51.348
All right?

00:58:51.348 --> 00:58:57.008
All right, so now stand up for that
and do it, do it. You have to do it.

00:58:59.868 --> 00:59:04.288
This is the answer. All right, Warren, correct?

00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:10.200
You'll never catch. It is when you think.
You'll never catch. You take it from me.

00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:15.230
You have given realisation to so many people.
Where are the catches? You are so much better.

00:59:15.290 --> 00:59:18.710
And if you don’t give
vibrations, then you will catch.

00:59:18.750 --> 00:59:25.360
Because you will have vibrations attacked here,
attacked here and you will say “Oh God I cannot do it.”

00:59:26.910 --> 00:59:32.900
You don’t try to give vibrations to people who are negative
people. Just don’t bother your head, you are not to do it.

00:59:32.900 --> 00:59:38.310
See because you insist, so your ego catches, and
you think you are caught up. No, it is your ego,

00:59:38.335 --> 00:59:42.955
you know this is a thoroughly, useless person,
why waste your energy? Just don't bother.

00:59:42.955 --> 00:59:46.325
All right?

00:59:46.331 --> 00:59:50.165
You must be having some sensible
people around, isn’t it?

00:59:51.885 --> 00:59:58.792
[Shri Mataji explains in Marathi.]

01:08:50.837 --> 01:08:59.117
Mr. Phaldankar has raised a question that people
who do black magic or some sort of thing like that,

01:08:59.115 --> 01:09:13.488
what is the remedy in Sahaja Yoga for that? And Mr. Dhumal will reply that question in Marathi and afterwards Professor Chavan will say in English.

01:09:27.738 --> 01:09:42.137
[Mr. Dhumal answers in Marathi.]

01:16:59.479 --> 01:17:15.419
Now when we come across any person, who comes to you to seek help to get relief from effects of black magic, what one should do?

01:17:17.031 --> 01:17:24.953
That was the question. And the reply
furnished was, now as far as possible,

01:17:24.982 --> 01:17:34.863
you first see whether any person in
that family is practicing Sahaja Yoga.

01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:51.810
If the person is practicing Sahaja Yoga then it is all right, you may think of extending your help, otherwise it is best to keep aloof from such persons.

01:17:53.032 --> 01:17:58.580
Now when you want to extend
help what are we to do?

01:18:00.860 --> 01:18:06.690
For the persons who practice black magic,

01:18:06.730 --> 01:18:22.654
they always first try to put bandhanas or try to tie
up the deities which are being prayed by that person.

01:18:22.654 --> 01:18:32.803
So, our first job is to relieve that bandhana or that
tying on the deity that is being worshipped by that person.

01:18:32.803 --> 01:18:39.753
Now how to do this? This can be
done by our method of integration,

01:18:39.783 --> 01:18:48.583
so the deity which is being prayed, being worshipped by that person has to be put, the name of the deity has to be put in that mantra

01:18:48.617 --> 01:18:58.717
and then in the... our regular fashion, we can just
integrate that name with that of the Divine Mother

01:18:58.767 --> 01:19:11.697
and thus by doing this, that particular deity, it gets that
gets first relieved, then you have to work on the person.

01:19:12.997 --> 01:19:21.622
So, the other thing is,

01:19:25.702 --> 01:19:31.302
now the treatment to the person that is this is regarding that.

01:19:31.342 --> 01:19:40.202
Now we come to the person concerned, if that person is to be given treatment, first is that earthen pot treatment, matka treatment, you know the way the treatment is given. So, this is the best treatment.

01:19:40.243 --> 01:19:49.121
(putting seven lemons and seven green chillies in
it), you know the way the treatment is given.

01:19:49.151 --> 01:19:51.361
So, this is the best treatment.

01:19:51.361 --> 01:20:01.254
The second treatment is burning chillies (red
chillies) along with little salt and mustard seeds.

01:20:01.292 --> 01:20:05.722
So, these three things put together, they are burnt in that house.

01:20:05.722 --> 01:20:14.882
Now, you will find, that if they are burnt
generally you will have coughing in the house.

01:20:14.882 --> 01:20:23.886
But if the black magic is operating in that
house you will find that there is no coughing,

01:20:23.912 --> 01:20:26.412
you can breathe normally in that house.

01:20:26.412 --> 01:20:28.432
So, that is the effect of black magic.

01:20:28.432 --> 01:20:35.722
So, once that chillies and mustard seeds and little salt put together when they are burnt

01:20:35.734 --> 01:20:48.556
for a while, say 3-4 chillies that will suffice. Every day that treatment can be given for 3-4 days or 5 days depending on the intensity. As the intensity decreases you can just stop it.

01:20:48.556 --> 01:21:01.276
Then the Kumkum, you have to always ask the person to
apply the Kumkum on the forehead and on the Sahasrara.

01:21:02.239 --> 01:21:15.369
Then you can also ask, one thing is very important, the person concerned, you have to ask that person to completely surrender to the Mother.

01:21:15.436 --> 01:21:22.655
This is again one point I forgot and this
you have to ask him to do this first.

01:21:22.676 --> 01:21:25.778
Unless he surrenders completely this won’t happen.

01:21:25.778 --> 01:21:28.278
This is the most important thing.

01:21:28.278 --> 01:21:38.719
Because generally people call us or invite us for helping them out of this situation, but when we go they are not prepared to accept this first.

01:21:38.719 --> 01:21:42.419
And then they simultaneously ask
that they should get relieved.

01:21:42.478 --> 01:21:52.579
Now two things cannot operate at a time. So, first the person concerned should completely surrender and then only you can extend the help.

01:21:53.169 --> 01:21:55.669
Thank you!

01:22:04.139 --> 01:22:15.699
In addition to this, I mean there are so many other things
as you know is to ask the person to beat with the chappals

01:22:15.722 --> 01:22:19.022
and some things like that, the
relations can beat him with chappals

01:22:19.022 --> 01:22:24.112
or all these things as you know.How
to burn the name of the person

01:22:24.132 --> 01:22:33.452
and all these things that you know about, how to get rid of these
horrible negativities of the person, which you can all work it out.

01:22:33.532 --> 01:22:39.902
It’s not difficult. But better thing these things
are done by not relations but other Sahaja Yogis.

01:22:39.939 --> 01:22:44.259
to help them that would be
better. So, this all you know.

01:22:44.270 --> 01:22:53.289
[Shri Mataji explains in Marathi.]

01:23:17.303 --> 01:23:19.803
This is the last question.

01:23:32.979 --> 01:23:41.056
I would like to ask this question
to the members of the panel here.

01:23:43.326 --> 01:24:01.439
It has been my observation during the last three years that in the midst of our dear Mataji in Bombay or in Pune or during her programmes,

01:24:01.439 --> 01:24:09.681
we draw hundreds of people towards Sahaja Yoga in
the various halls where the programmes are held.

01:24:11.506 --> 01:24:22.937
But after our Mother’s departure we are not able
to hold on even to the fifth of the gathering.

01:24:24.338 --> 01:24:32.858
I would like the members to analyse this and
to tell me as to what should be done by us

01:24:32.925 --> 01:24:42.550
whether in Bombay, Pune, Rahuri, Delhi, Paris or England anywhere or even in Australia where the Mother would be shortly going.

01:24:42.575 --> 01:24:51.600
And I would also request our dear Mother to give us
some wisdom on this occasion and some guidelines also.

01:30:30.712 --> 01:30:33.212
This is a...  A question was asked

01:30:36.629 --> 01:30:41.549
that why is it that when  Mother is there
we get thousands and thousands of people

01:30:41.549 --> 01:30:46.149
and when She goes away then there hardly
any people coming to the programme and

01:30:46.204 --> 01:30:49.619
very few people stick on
and what is the reason?

01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:52.229
And what should we do about it?

01:30:52.302 --> 01:31:00.779
Now, Dhumal has told something which also I may
repeat but I will tell you something more practical,

01:31:00.807 --> 01:31:08.387
much more practical that will work out. He
has said it’s true that it is like a farming.

01:31:08.453 --> 01:31:17.200
You see when the farming, in the farming you
have to look after the small little sprouts

01:31:17.200 --> 01:31:27.028
and then you try to make them grow into trees and you have to really bother about them and find out how they are growing and all that is very important

01:31:27.028 --> 01:31:33.839
and which is true what he says is true but how you can
achieve it? Which is very simple as I will tell you.

01:31:33.889 --> 01:31:39.309
First of all, when we have any programme
say in the city or in a village,

01:31:39.357 --> 01:31:47.789
we all people who are Sahaja Yogis should form really
a very strong intricate and a very dedicated group,

01:31:47.874 --> 01:31:53.949
absolutely and like CIDs you can
call, or like very, very alert people.

01:31:53.984 --> 01:32:02.189
And we should sit down, Mataji is working out and your attention should be not to take vibrations or anything but sit around the people

01:32:02.322 --> 01:32:06.781
and be on the watch out who gets
realisation and who gets it.

01:32:06.810 --> 01:32:13.311
You divide the whole group that comes in, in such a way that
you get hold of some people, some people, some people here.

01:32:13.311 --> 01:32:18.135
Like say there are 25 Sahaja
Yogis and say there are 500 people.

01:32:18.175 --> 01:32:22.565
Now out of 500 at least if not at least 300 will get realisation.

01:32:22.614 --> 01:32:31.425
Now these 25 people should suddenly sort of surround those
people who are around and take their addresses everything.
