WEBVTT

00:44:20.487 --> 00:44:25.487
Shanta Mavshi: Shri Mataji wants that I should explain the meaning of this song to you all.

00:44:25.487 --> 00:44:30.487
I have already explained to the students who were learning.

00:44:34.487 --> 00:44:48.487
This song is mainly to say that you may call God by different names, but He is one and the same.

00:44:48.487 --> 00:44:55.487
So you may call Him Ram, you may call Him Bhrama, you may call Him Kana or Mahadev.

00:44:55.487 --> 00:45:06.487
Kana is Krishna, Shri Krishna and Mahadev is Lord Shankara's name is Mahadev, Parasnaath.

00:45:06.487 --> 00:45:17.487
Parasnaath is the name of Mahaviras, that is those who follow Jainism.

00:45:17.487 --> 00:45:21.487
They may call Him by the name of Parasnaath.

00:45:21.487 --> 00:45:30.487
Shri Mataji: And he has a Kundalini on top of His head. Parasnaath was one of the first, the first, the [unclear].

00:45:30.487 --> 00:45:32.487
And this one was the last.

00:45:32.487 --> 00:45:44.487
Shanta Mavshi: Yes. So and also some people even call Him by the name of Brahma, but all this is in one and that is Sarkala Brahma.

00:45:44.487 --> 00:45:47.487
Shri Mataji: He is the Paramchaitanya, completely.

00:45:47.487 --> 00:45:50.487
[unclear] self, itself.

00:45:50.487 --> 00:45:52.487
Shanta Mavshi: Yes, [unclear].

00:45:52.487 --> 00:46:00.487
Now Bhaganabhe, the Kahavatana, that is this external forms of worship may be different.

00:46:00.487 --> 00:46:06.487
Shri Mataji: [Hindi/marathi]

00:46:07.487 --> 00:46:14.007
Different utensils are made [unclear]

00:46:14.057 --> 00:46:16.557
Shanta Mavshi:  but the mud is the same.

00:46:17.487 --> 00:46:18.487
Shri Mataji: Mud is the same.

00:46:18.487 --> 00:46:26.487
Shanta Mavshi: Yes, and you may see it in different shapes. The shapes are different, but the material is the same.

00:46:26.487 --> 00:46:28.487
Shri Mataji: It's the ruptika.

00:46:29.487 --> 00:46:30.487
Shanta Mavshi: And,

00:46:33.487 --> 00:46:42.487
So if we divide God into so many forms, it is in our own, because of our own imagination.

00:46:42.487 --> 00:46:43.487
Yes.

00:46:50.487 --> 00:46:54.487
You are undivided.

00:46:55.487 --> 00:47:02.487
The God within you, which dwells within you, is one.

00:47:02.487 --> 00:47:04.487
Undivided.

00:47:10.983 --> 00:47:13.483
Shri Mataji: Enjoy himself.

00:47:13.487 --> 00:47:14.487
Shanta Mavshi: Yes.

00:47:23.267 --> 00:47:29.487
Shri Mataji: The one who is enjoying himself is the Rama, means if you also say.

00:47:29.487 --> 00:47:30.487
Shanta Mavshi: Yes.

00:47:30.487 --> 00:47:35.487
The followers of Rama are the type who enjoy within themselves.

00:47:35.487 --> 00:47:41.487
And the followers of Rahimah are those who are kind to others.

00:47:42.487 --> 00:47:44.487
Compassion.

00:47:44.487 --> 00:47:49.487
Kindness and compassion for others is the quality of those.

00:47:49.487 --> 00:47:50.487
Rahimah.

00:47:50.487 --> 00:47:51.487
Yes.

00:47:51.487 --> 00:47:52.487
Shri Mataji: Quality of Rahimah.

00:47:52.487 --> 00:47:53.487
Shanta Mavshi: Yes.

00:47:53.487 --> 00:47:55.487
Shri Mataji: So those who follow should have that.

00:47:55.487 --> 00:47:56.487
Shanta Mavshi: Yes.

00:47:56.487 --> 00:48:02.487
Those who follow Rahimah should have the quality of being kind and compassionate to others.

00:48:02.487 --> 00:48:15.487
Karma philosophy of Gita is for those who worship Shri Krishna.

00:48:17.487 --> 00:48:19.487
Shri Mataji: The karma becoming akarma.

00:48:19.487 --> 00:48:25.487
Once you become surrendered to Shri Krishna and He does everything, you don't do anything.

00:48:25.487 --> 00:48:28.487
So this is the karma philosophy of Shri Krishna.

00:48:28.487 --> 00:48:31.487
That you surrender yourself to Him, so you don't do anything.

00:48:31.487 --> 00:48:38.487
The one who does like that are the ones who follow Shri Krishna should do that.

00:48:38.487 --> 00:48:40.487
Shanta Mavshi: Then Mahadeva, [unclear].

00:48:40.487 --> 00:48:50.487
Shri Mataji: If you worship Shiva, then you should just ask for nirvana, for realization and nothing else.

00:48:50.487 --> 00:48:53.487
Shanta Mavshi: Then the last is Paraseh.

00:48:53.487 --> 00:48:57.487
Paraseh is to see.

00:48:57.487 --> 00:49:02.487
Paraseh.

00:49:02.487 --> 00:49:05.487
Shri Mataji: Parashnath is the deity.

00:49:05.487 --> 00:49:09.487
In the [unclear] of Jainese.

00:49:09.487 --> 00:49:12.487
And the Parashnath has got the Kundalini behind him.

00:49:12.487 --> 00:49:15.487
So he is the master of Kundalini.

00:49:15.487 --> 00:49:16.487
So Paraseh Rupa.

00:49:16.487 --> 00:49:21.487
Paraseh Rupa means the one who changes the form.

00:49:21.487 --> 00:49:23.487
He is the Paraseh.

00:49:23.487 --> 00:49:27.258
Paraseh is the stone which converts everything into gold.

00:49:27.487 --> 00:49:29.487
Shanta Mavshi: Yes, that I have explained to them.

00:49:29.487 --> 00:49:31.487
Shri Mataji: Paraseh means the transformation.

00:49:31.487 --> 00:49:36.487
The one who transforms your, your...

00:49:38.487 --> 00:49:42.487
Yourself, you can say, but Rupa actually means your...

00:49:42.487 --> 00:49:44.487
Shanta Mavshi: Your whole being is transformed.

00:49:44.487 --> 00:49:45.487
Shri Mataji: Your being.

00:49:45.487 --> 00:49:46.487
Your being is transformed.

00:49:46.487 --> 00:49:53.487
The one whole being which is transformed, the one who once, who calls themselves as the

00:49:53.487 --> 00:50:00.487
disciple of Parashnath, should be able to transform the Rupa of the [unclear].

00:50:00.487 --> 00:50:02.487
So they are Paras.

00:50:02.487 --> 00:50:07.487
Paras means the Paras stone is the one which, if you touch to anything, it is a...

00:50:07.487 --> 00:50:09.487
What is it called in English?

00:50:09.487 --> 00:50:10.487
It becomes gold.

00:50:10.487 --> 00:50:12.487
Shanta Mavshi: It is a [unclear].

00:50:12.487 --> 00:50:13.487
It is called [unclear].

00:50:13.487 --> 00:50:14.487
Shri Mataji: It is [unclear].

00:50:14.487 --> 00:50:18.487
So if you, Paras means [touch stone?].

00:50:18.487 --> 00:50:19.487
Yes.

00:50:19.487 --> 00:50:26.487
So the one who, who is the one who is following Parashnath, should be able to transform people.

00:50:26.487 --> 00:50:29.487
Brahma [unknown] Brahmari.

00:50:29.487 --> 00:50:36.487
The one who can recognize the Brahma, means the Chaitanya, is the Brahma.

00:50:36.487 --> 00:50:39.487
[hindi/marathi]

00:50:39.487 --> 00:50:41.487
Shanta Mavshi: Anandagana.

00:50:41.487 --> 00:50:46.487
Shri Mataji: Anandagana is the cloud of joy.

00:50:46.487 --> 00:50:48.487
Shanta Mavshi: It is the name of the poet also.

00:50:48.487 --> 00:50:49.487
Yes.

00:50:49.487 --> 00:50:50.487
Shri Mataji: Also the poet's name.

00:50:50.487 --> 00:50:51.487
Yes.

00:50:51.487 --> 00:51:00.487
So he said, this is how you have to, you have to sort of, this is a Muranglapa.

00:51:00.487 --> 00:51:02.237
You must achieve.

00:51:02.337 --> 00:51:16.477
This is the way you should achieve your cloud of joy. 

00:51:16.487 --> 00:51:17.487
Shanta Mavshi: Chaitanya-mana.

00:51:17.487 --> 00:51:22.487
Shri Mataji: Which is Chaitanya-maya and nikarma, means there is no karmas there.

00:51:22.487 --> 00:51:24.487
It is Chaitanya-maya, nikarma.

00:51:24.487 --> 00:51:28.487
Means it is without any karma, action.

00:51:28.487 --> 00:51:30.487
So you achieve that.

00:51:30.487 --> 00:51:31.487
It's beautiful.

00:51:31.487 --> 00:51:32.487
Put it in Anandagana.

00:51:32.487 --> 00:51:33.487
Shanta Mavshi: Anandagana.

00:51:33.487 --> 00:51:37.487
Shri Mataji: Beautiful, I mean such a thing is.

00:51:37.487 --> 00:51:39.487
Absolute truth.

00:51:39.487 --> 00:51:41.487
Shanta Mavshi: Philosophy is really beautiful.

00:51:41.487 --> 00:51:45.487
The whole philosophy in this, highest.

00:51:45.487 --> 00:51:47.487
Shri Mataji: Sahaja Yoga, Sahaja Yoga.

00:51:47.487 --> 00:51:49.487
Shanta Mavshi: That's why I chose it for this.

00:51:49.487 --> 00:51:51.487
And it is in Rag [Paddhik?].

00:51:52.487 --> 00:51:53.487
Shri Mataji: Yes.

00:51:54.417 --> 00:51:55.727
[unknown]

00:52:37.487 --> 00:52:40.987
Take it off, please.

00:52:45.737 --> 00:52:48.487
You want to sing some song now?

00:52:48.487 --> 00:52:49.487
Yogi: The Children have a song.

00:52:49.487 --> 00:52:52.827
They have a special song for you too.

00:52:52.827 --> 00:52:56.327
Shri Mataji: The children from France.

00:52:56.327 --> 00:53:00.087
Alright.

00:53:00.087 --> 00:53:02.987
You want to [unclear]?

01:19:18.637 --> 01:19:23.637
You see I told them that they should make some songs on the pop style.

01:19:25.637 --> 01:19:33.637
Because you see it's very popular and if you can make nice songs on Sahaja Yoga on pop style

01:19:33.637 --> 01:19:39.637
also it can go on the stages and we can impress people much more by that you see.

01:19:39.637 --> 01:19:42.637
And there are some very good songs also.

01:19:42.637 --> 01:19:49.637
So this one Mr. [unclear] if you know him from Canada, he's also making some very beautiful songs like that.

01:19:49.637 --> 01:19:55.637
And I'm sure these songs once they become popular Sahaja Yoga will spread much faster

01:19:55.637 --> 01:19:59.637
because these Indian songs are all right for Maharashtra.

01:20:04.637 --> 01:20:11.637
And now pop music is even popular in India also.

01:20:11.637 --> 01:20:23.637
So you see to popularize the music is better to compose songs in pop music also.

01:20:23.637 --> 01:20:26.637
If you people can try some will be good idea.

01:20:26.637 --> 01:20:32.637
So that we could have some pop music and in that we sing about Sahaja Yoga

01:20:32.637 --> 01:20:36.637
because after all we have to communicate and these are the days when there's a demand.

01:20:36.637 --> 01:20:38.637
So one should do it.

01:20:45.637 --> 01:20:50.637
So this is something is a big venture and I think it will all work out very well.

01:21:03.637 --> 01:21:05.637
Real pop style should be.

01:21:05.637 --> 01:21:11.637
Shanta Mavshi: We are trying our best to save classical music from popularization.

01:21:14.637 --> 01:21:17.637
Shri Mataji: You see if Sahaja Yoga spread is classical music will spread.

01:21:17.637 --> 01:21:18.637
Shanta Mavshi: Yes.

01:21:18.637 --> 01:21:23.637
Shri Mataji: You see these people can you imagine we could not teach one sound to these English people.

01:21:23.637 --> 01:21:26.637
But how they have learnt it through the Omkara.

01:21:26.637 --> 01:21:29.637
Because the Atma is awakened.

01:21:29.637 --> 01:21:33.637
It can just feel the classical music in no time.

01:21:33.637 --> 01:21:36.637
But first to awaken that we have to go through this method.

01:21:36.637 --> 01:21:38.637
Shanta Mavshi: Yes.

01:21:38.637 --> 01:21:41.637
To spread Sahaja Yoga.

01:21:46.637 --> 01:21:48.637
Shri Mataji: Very powerful at this.

01:21:48.637 --> 01:21:49.637
Powerful.

01:21:49.637 --> 01:21:52.637
We must accept the power of the song.

01:21:52.637 --> 01:21:53.637
That's why people like it.

01:21:53.637 --> 01:21:55.637
You see and we should use it now.

01:21:55.637 --> 01:21:57.637
I think there's no harm about that.

01:21:57.637 --> 01:22:01.637
Only thing is once they become Sahaja Yogis they are all going to sing,

01:22:01.637 --> 01:22:03.637
Amhi Bi Gadhalo 

01:22:07.637 --> 01:22:10.637
Before that we have to bring them now.

01:22:10.637 --> 01:22:15.637
And it's very assertive song, very assurance song that we are the light.

01:22:15.637 --> 01:22:17.637
It's a fact.

01:22:17.637 --> 01:22:19.637
So why not say it?

01:22:23.637 --> 01:22:26.637
All right, so let's have one.

01:22:26.637 --> 01:22:28.637
What about you?

01:22:28.637 --> 01:22:29.637
Where is he?

01:22:29.637 --> 01:22:31.637
Are you going to give some song?

01:22:31.637 --> 01:22:32.637
Yogi: Of course.

01:22:32.637 --> 01:22:34.637
Shri Mataji: With the group.

01:22:34.637 --> 01:22:36.637
I told that we'll have some music program.

01:22:36.637 --> 01:22:37.637
You should have arranged.

01:22:37.637 --> 01:22:41.637
Yogi: Sorry Shri Mataji, but the [unclear] is not here.

01:22:41.637 --> 01:22:43.637
I mean there are so many people still in...

01:22:43.637 --> 01:22:45.637
In Praga, in Praga.

01:22:45.637 --> 01:22:47.637
Shri Mataji: Why is it missing?

01:22:47.637 --> 01:22:49.637
Yogi: In Budapest.

01:22:58.247 --> 01:23:00.747
Shri Mataji: All right,  so now let's have a collective song

01:32:09.501 --> 01:32:11.501
May God bless you all. 

01:32:22.501 --> 01:32:25.501
So tomorrow again my tour starts.

01:32:26.501 --> 01:32:28.501
Continuous.

01:32:29.501 --> 01:32:33.501
But it was a nice rest here.

01:32:33.501 --> 01:32:37.501
So I am again going on my tour.

01:32:37.501 --> 01:32:39.501
Continuous.

01:32:39.501 --> 01:32:45.501
It was such a nice relief to come here and rest

01:32:45.501 --> 01:32:50.501
and enjoy your company.

01:32:50.501 --> 01:32:53.501
May God bless you all.

01:32:54.501 --> 01:32:59.501
But you all have to now move out to other countries

01:32:59.501 --> 01:33:04.501
and try to see that you establish Sahaja Yoga properly.

01:33:04.501 --> 01:33:07.501
Be kind to them, be nice to them.

01:33:07.501 --> 01:33:11.501
And also there are oppositions from other people, no doubt.

01:33:11.501 --> 01:33:14.501
But you have to be very patient with them

01:33:14.501 --> 01:33:19.501
and try to tell them that you haven't found

01:33:19.501 --> 01:33:21.501
anything so far.

01:33:21.501 --> 01:33:24.501
Why don't you find out what is the truth?

01:33:24.501 --> 01:33:26.501
Why don't you find it out?

01:33:26.501 --> 01:33:31.501
If you are kind to them they might accept your invitation.

01:33:31.501 --> 01:33:37.501
So I hope all of you will take the responsibility as such

01:33:37.501 --> 01:33:40.501
to go around and help people.

01:33:40.501 --> 01:33:43.501
And specially women I think because they are much more free

01:33:43.501 --> 01:33:45.501
than men are, men are working.

01:33:45.501 --> 01:33:50.501
Those who are free can go around and can really spread Sahaja Yoga.

01:33:50.501 --> 01:33:53.501
In any case I am coming back for Ganesha Puja

01:33:53.501 --> 01:33:58.501
which I hope this time you will have all your [unclear] ready,

01:33:58.501 --> 01:34:03.501
all your music ready, everything in a big way.

01:34:03.501 --> 01:34:08.501
And we are really going to enjoy Ganesha Puja this time.

01:34:09.501 --> 01:34:18.501
I feel one thing about Sahaja Yogis

01:34:18.501 --> 01:34:22.501
that there are some Sahaja Yogis who are very active.

01:34:22.501 --> 01:34:26.501
And I find some Sahaja Yogis only come to receive me at the airport.

01:34:26.501 --> 01:34:27.501
That's all.

01:34:27.501 --> 01:34:29.501
They are like tourists, you see.

01:34:29.501 --> 01:34:33.501
Just come for the receiving at the airport or for something.

01:34:33.501 --> 01:34:35.501
This is not the way.

01:34:35.501 --> 01:34:39.501
You must know you have to work for Sahaja Yoga.

01:34:39.501 --> 01:34:44.501
If you don't work for Sahaja Yoga you cannot progress.

01:34:44.501 --> 01:34:48.501
It's like one door is open, one window is open.

01:34:48.501 --> 01:34:50.501
But if you don't open the other window

01:34:50.501 --> 01:34:54.501
there cannot be any circulation, there cannot be any freshness

01:34:54.501 --> 01:34:56.501
and you cannot growth.

01:34:56.501 --> 01:35:01.501
Now I have seen those people who have really done any work

01:35:01.501 --> 01:35:05.501
for Sahaja Yoga have gone all out, attended all the programs,

01:35:05.501 --> 01:35:10.501
everything with dedication and have gone very fast.

01:35:10.491 --> 01:35:16.491
All such people who are just [unclear] will be very late

01:35:16.501 --> 01:35:20.501
or maybe completely discarded.

01:35:20.501 --> 01:35:27.501
Or could be that they may not have any saying the matter.

01:35:27.501 --> 01:35:35.501
So as it is I think it is very important that we should value our self-respect,

01:35:35.501 --> 01:35:42.501
our self-knowledge, our self-realization.

01:35:42.501 --> 01:35:48.501
I need not tell you this because you know that you have got your self-realization

01:35:48.501 --> 01:35:51.501
and I feel you give it embarrass to say this.

01:35:51.501 --> 01:35:56.501
But I have seen this tendency in many people and I am amazed

01:35:56.501 --> 01:36:01.501
that after getting all these blessings, after knowing that this is the truth,

01:36:01.501 --> 01:36:05.501
after knowing that we are born in these important times,

01:36:05.501 --> 01:36:08.501
after knowing that we are chosen people,

01:36:08.501 --> 01:36:11.501
after knowing that we have got realization,

01:36:11.501 --> 01:36:19.501
even then they take it lightly as something like a pastime is very wrong.

01:36:19.501 --> 01:36:23.501
So what I know about is that there are about few people

01:36:23.501 --> 01:36:26.501
who are really doing work of Sahaja Yoga,

01:36:26.501 --> 01:36:28.501
running about, organizing everything.

01:36:28.501 --> 01:36:34.501
The rest of them are just like visitors

01:36:34.501 --> 01:36:39.501
and that is a very wrong attitude, very wrong attitude.

01:36:39.501 --> 01:36:42.501
See there is not much sacrifice in general.

01:36:42.501 --> 01:36:44.501
Nobody has to sacrifice anything.

01:36:44.501 --> 01:36:47.501
On the contrary you all are blessed,

01:36:47.501 --> 01:36:50.501
thousand time blessed, you've got everything.

01:36:50.501 --> 01:36:52.501
But what have you done for that?

01:36:52.501 --> 01:36:54.501
What have you given for Sahaja Yoga?

01:36:54.501 --> 01:36:58.501
What have you given for God?

01:36:58.501 --> 01:36:59.501
This work.

01:36:59.501 --> 01:37:01.501
What have you done for Him?

01:37:01.501 --> 01:37:05.501
It has been only one sided thing that we have received all the blessings

01:37:05.501 --> 01:37:09.501
and I received letters, somebody sick you must cure,

01:37:09.501 --> 01:37:11.501
somebody is not well, do this, do that.

01:37:11.501 --> 01:37:13.501
That's all.

01:37:13.501 --> 01:37:15.501
It's all one sided.

01:37:15.501 --> 01:37:17.501
But why?
