1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,480
Better?

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:04,800
Good.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,440
You came before, did you, no?

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:26,880
So to continue with the same topic we had,\h
about the infrastructure of a human being,\h\h

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,360
about which I told you, that God has made\h
this infrastructure very beautifully.

6
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,600
Even in nature if you see\h\h

7
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:49,200
anything that is living, see a tree if\h
you look at the tree, you’ll be amazed,\h\h

8
00:00:51,760 --> 00:01:03,200
how the different channels that takes the\h
sap upwards are so beautifully placed that\h\h

9
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,840
there’s no problem for water to rise.

10
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:21,680
The suction in the water takes place because\h
the sun shines and the water is sucked in.

11
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,800
The nature is so nicely built\h
up, absolutely harmonious.

12
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:41,200
When it is winter time the leaves drop out\h
because the Mother Earth requires the nutrition\h\h

13
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:54,320
and the leaves are not getting so much of\h
sunshine, so there should be less surface exposed.

14
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,920
The same nutrition is taken up again,\h\h

15
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:14,120
and again, in the spring, you find again\h
the beautiful leaves breaking through.

16
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,040
It’s so beautifully worked out, the whole\h\h

17
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:27,360
situation, the whole Universe is so\h
beautifully made, and the infrastructure\h\h

18
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:38,240
is so made that it receives all the blessings\h
of the Divine without any difficulty.

19
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:49,840
It rains and the nature receives it.

20
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:59,440
If you’ve ever been to a forest, to a densest\h
forest that you could think of, you’ll be\h\h

21
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:09,680
amazed how clean it is; and the fragrance of\h
that place is so clean, nothing stagnates.

22
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:19,200
How it operates and how it works out through\h
sunshine, through rain, through wind.

23
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,520
In this whole Universe,\h\h

24
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,840
now man is created, which is a problem.

25
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:39,760
The infrastructure of man can be\h
ruined by him; it’s only he can do it.

26
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,840
The trees cannot ruin themselves, can they?

27
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,760
They stand up like witnesses,\h
they just give, just give.

28
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,160
Even when they die they give their wood.

29
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,640
When they live they give their flowers,\h\h

30
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,520
they give their shade, they give their beauty,\h
they are giving, giving, giving, all the time.

31
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:16,480
And the one who takes is this great\h
epitome of creation – the human being.

32
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,680
He’s the recipient of all that.

33
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:30,080
Then, he has got intelligence to receive\h\h

34
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,960
everything from that and to\h
use it for one’s own purpose.

35
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:50,400
That’s how we are exploiting – I would\h
say exploiting – the blessings of nature.

36
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:02,560
That’s good, that’s what God wanted that we\h
should really have the blessings of nature; that\h\h

37
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:13,360
you are the monarchs of this Universe, so [that]\h
everything stands in attention for your needs.

38
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,320
While man, on his own,\h\h

39
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,800
goes mad with his extreme behaviour.

40
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,040
He doesn’t think of his\h
infrastructure which he can ruin.

41
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,240
The problem is, only the man can ruin that;\h\h

42
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:41,760
not only that but also the outer\h
structure which is the atmosphere.

43
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,600
You send one man to a forest, it’s alright.

44
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,080
If you send two hundred tigers\h
to a forest, it’s alright.

45
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:05,840
But if you send ten men to a forest –\h
finished! All the beauty is finished.

46
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:13,440
On one side, the sense of beauty,\h
only human beings have got.

47
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:22,560
The sense of understanding cleanliness\h
only human beings have got.

48
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,160
So they are the only enjoyers, they\h
are the only enjoyers of all this.

49
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:34,080
They are supposed to enjoy all\h
this but there is something lacking\h\h

50
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,560
in them which doesn’t give the full enjoyment.

51
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:53,200
When you look at a tree – today cherry blossom\h
everywhere – then the thought starts coming,\h\h

52
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,040
“How much they must have paid for this tree?

53
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:07,200
How many years it must have taken?” All these\h
mundane type of questions come to your mind.

54
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:21,200
But supposing, by any chance, if no thoughts\h
come into your mind, you just see, witness, could\h\h

55
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:29,840
witness, then the joy that they are trying to give\h
you and express would be complete within yourself.

56
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:43,840
That state we have not yet achieved: Always we\h
have thoughts, thoughts which are all artificial.

57
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,240
Thoughts that make you\h\h

58
00:07:53,200 --> 00:08:02,800
some sort of a imaginary person or, if you don’t\h
go to the subtler side, a very gross person.

59
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,640
It’s not reality.

60
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:12,320
Imagination is not Reality\h
and also the grossness is not.

61
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:18,480
Like a poet might say that, “What a flower is\h
there and its beautiful,” and that and that.

62
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:25,840
And all sort of stories he may build up about\h
a flower, and a person who is not imaginary\h\h

63
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:35,200
might say, “I don’t know how much it will cost,\h
how to put it down, what is the use of this,\h\h

64
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,840
how it can be economic."

65
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,480
Poetry is, of course, touches,\h
subtler side of life, no doubt.

66
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,080
And thank God Hampstead had so many great poets.

67
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,400
But still is imaginary for other people.

68
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,640
What you look at, and you think,\h
may not be true for others.

69
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,400
For example a person like Blake, who\h
wrote all poetry, nobody understood Him.

70
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,240
To understand Him also you\h
have to have Realisation\h\h

71
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,840
otherwise you can’t understand Him at all.

72
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:25,360
So, whatever is rendered, on\h
gross level or on imaginary level,\h\h

73
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:36,000
by the nature, cannot be enjoyed by human\h
beings to its full extent, cannot be.

74
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,720
We think so.

75
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:45,680
Look at the economic laws as they are that\h
– “Wants in general are not satiable."

76
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,200
Means that’s not satisfying at all.

77
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,400
I mean it says, it confesses.

78
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,720
Today you want to have a car?

79
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,080
Alright, you have a car.

80
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,440
Then you want to have an aeroplane?

81
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,880
Alright, you have an aeroplane.

82
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,880
Then you want to have some sort of a thing.

83
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,480
There’s no end to it.

84
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:12,560
So it proves that the joy that you get out\h
of material things also are not satisfying.

85
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,880
Because at the state at which\h
human beings are they cannot enjoy.

86
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,240
They cannot enjoy anything, though\h
they are supposed to enjoy everything,\h\h

87
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,200
because they only have the capacity to enjoy.

88
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:33,720
But there is something lacking in them\h
by which they cannot enjoy anything.

89
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,560
And what is that quality?

90
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,240
What is that state?

91
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:50,960
Because the connection for extracting\h
joy has to be with the Spirit.

92
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,040
Spirit is the connection which emits joy.

93
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,480
There’s no other way to\h
enjoy life without remorse.

94
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,080
To be connected,\h\h

95
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:18,960
first, with Spirit is the only way that we\h
enjoy because joy doesn’t have double side.

96
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,640
Like people go for a ballroom dancing.

97
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,640
Supposed to be enjoying.

98
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,080
They come home and a big fight starts with them.

99
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:37,440
God knows what they have enjoyed for!\h
The enjoyment of life is only possible\h\h

100
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,720
if we could get connected to the Spirit.

101
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,600
And that connection to the Spirit,\h\h

102
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:56,560
is only possible if you sprout\h
into that, you become the Spirit.

103
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,320
As Christ has said in very simple\h
words that, “You are to be born again."

104
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:03,840
Very simple.

105
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,080
Looks very simple.

106
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,840
But how?

107
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,880
You are to be baptised, but how?

108
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,960
Say I go to a theosophical college or\h
some sort of a college and they say,\h\h

109
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,840
“Now you have got a right to baptise."

110
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,720
Now to any intelligent man\h
does it appeal that way?

111
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,680
Can it be possible?

112
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:38,400
Baptism, if it’s a living process, in which you\h
have to get connected, connected with the Spirit,\h\h

113
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,920
then what do you do about it?

114
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:51,840
That means you have to achieve a state\h
of mind, where you become the Spirit.

115
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,080
That connection has to be established.

116
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:05,840
If that connection is not established, then you\h
cannot be a twice-born by certifying yourself.

117
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,280
I have seen many people they\h
said, “Mother, I am twice-born."

118
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,840
I said, “How do you say you are twice-born?”\h\h

119
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:21,280
“What is the certificate you have got of being\h
twice-born?” You cannot just certify yourself.

120
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,040
This is not a self-certification.

121
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,520
Supposing a dog says: “I am a human being."

122
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,240
Will you accept?

123
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:35,920
No, I mean, he can go about, he can go\h
about and say that, “I am a human being."

124
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,920
But he doesn’t become.

125
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:48,000
It’s a state, is a quality, which\h
is, in evolution, has to be shown.

126
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,520
It’s an evolutionary quality.

127
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,520
A fish, which has to become a\h
tortoise has to become a tortoise.

128
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,360
She can’t just say that, “Oh! I am a tortoise.

129
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,920
Oh! I am a tortoise."

130
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,760
This is where human ego comes in.

131
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,680
By saying something you do not become.

132
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:23,440
And this is one of the basic things we must know,\h
that we have to become in actuality, in reality.

133
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,760
We have to face up to it.

134
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:31,680
And not believing in something because it is said.

135
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,680
Anybody can say anything, what does it matter?

136
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,560
You see, you raise this tongue and put it\h
under your palate and say what you like!\h\h

137
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,840
What does it take to write a book?

138
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:50,080
You take some printer and you give him\h
something to write, you can write any trash,\h\h

139
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,840
any thing so-called, you can write\h
about God, this, that and talk big,\h\h

140
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:59,280
give sermons, have big organisations\h
– but it’s nothing of the kind.

141
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:10,480
Even supposing you have some animals,\h
like dogs specially, I would say that.

142
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,040
Now you make them dress up like\h\h

143
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:19,040
little babies and this and that, make them\h
dance and in a circus you might find they may\h\h

144
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:24,640
become little bit like human beings, they might\h
carry letters or may bring your children from the\h\h

145
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:29,920
school – I mean they can do lots of such things –\h
but will you call them human beings by any chance?

146
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:42,320
I’m not saying the difference is so much\h
but one has to understand one thing:\h\h

147
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:47,040
that we have not yet become the Spirit.

148
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:54,320
In all humility, let us accept this\h
fact that we have to become the Spirit.

149
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,960
Now, supposing that is the only source of joy,\h\h

150
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,160
if that is your real property within you,\h
if that is the thing you have to achieve,\h\h

151
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,840
supposing for that you have become a human\h
being, then must you not all do that?

152
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,120
It’s logical that life has no\h
meaning without it, you see.

153
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:21,920
You make a candle and you put a wick in that and\h
do everything with it and when there is darkness,\h\h

154
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:31,680
you say, “What are we to do now?”\h
Enlighten that light! It’s so simple.

155
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:39,360
The whole Existence itself will have no\h
meaning if we do not become the Spirit.

156
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,760
We all have to become the\h
Spirit otherwise we are useless.

157
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,360
We are good for nothing.

158
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,080
Our lives has no meaning.

159
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:59,360
Now when somebody says like that, I could be\h
another what you call hypocrite, or could be what\h\h

160
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,600
you call them false, fake guru, I could be\h
like that myself, telling you big stories.

161
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,560
Could be possible.

162
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:07,680
Alright?

163
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,160
Anybody could be like that.

164
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,840
But why cheat yourself, is the point.

165
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,960
Let anybody try to cheat you,\h
but you don’t cheat yourself.

166
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:31,840
You accept one simple point that you have\h
to become the Spirit, in all humility,\h\h

167
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:45,840
and that is one wish a seeker should have.

168
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:55,760
I have known seekers, they\h
try all kinds of things.

169
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,760
Like a gentleman had a very\h
bad this centre and asked him,\h\h

170
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,440
“What have you been doing?” He\h
said, “There’s some Rompashompa man.

171
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,600
He’s written some books, of the\h
third eye and I’m going to operate,\h\h

172
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,600
and my third eye is going to come out."

173
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,840
I said, “What?

174
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,760
Who has told you that?” He said,\h
“There are books after books on this."

175
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,960
I said, “Really?” And how dare\h
this fellow do that thing.

176
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,840
By operating here if you get\h
the third eye…(laughing).

177
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,320
And he was doing all kinds of nonsensical\h
things believing in that man, and his,\h\h

178
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,840
this centre itself was ruined.

179
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:42,960
I said, “But see the fellow what is he doing\h
himself?” You see, that’s the best part of it.

180
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,520
You see God has given us\h
not only brains, but wisdom.

181
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:54,240
God has given us wisdom and we should\h
use that wisdom, and judge these people\h\h

182
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,960
on these lines to see what they are telling us.

183
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,200
Most of them are ruining your infrastructure.

184
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:08,240
I would not care for anyone of them\h
if they were just smuggling money\h\h

185
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,760
or making you poor, doesn’t matter,\h
in the Kingdom of God, doesn’t matter.

186
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,200
Alright, if they want money, give them\h
away – finished! There are many smugglers,\h\h

187
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,200
thugs and robbers and swindlers.

188
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,440
All sorts of people are in this world, you see.

189
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,720
There are thousand and one words to describe them.

190
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,320
But they are spoiling your\h
infrastructure is the problem.

191
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,160
And when they spoil that infrastructure,\h\h

192
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:40,320
then this happening of Kundalini\h
awakening takes time, there’s the problem.

193
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,000
People develop diseases, they develop\h\h

194
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,480
emotional problems, mental problems, all\h
kinds of problems with all these things.

195
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,640
Actually you must know that, if you are a seeker,\h\h

196
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:06,000
and if you seek, you have to\h
become absolutely a normal person.

197
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,240
All your abnormalities must drop out.

198
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:19,840
If they don’t drop out then you should know\h
that you still have some horns coming out!\h\h

199
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,120
But people don’t understand that\h
being abnormal is (means) going down.

200
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:36,880
Anybody who thinks that he can paint his hair, or\h
wear a funny dress, walk about, he’ll achieve God,\h\h

201
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,720
I don’t know how to tell them\h
that this is not the way.

202
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:49,840
Or anybody who thinks that [if] he behaves in\h
a funny manner or shouts and screams and says\h\h

203
00:20:49,840 --> 00:21:01,840
the prayers very loudly on the street and do all\h
these shows, will go to God – is not possible.

204
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,200
Only way is to keep your wisdom intact:\h\h

205
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:18,240
your steadfast faith that you are the Spirit and\h
God is compassion and He will make you the Spirit.

206
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,600
This is the only thing that is needed in a seeker.

207
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,400
But without wisdom when you\h
try any one of these things\h\h

208
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:38,800
then you have to go [in] a very round circle to\h
come to the same point but completely bruised,\h\h

209
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,840
wounded, and sometimes absolutely sick to death.

210
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:57,840
The problem today is very complex.

211
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:07,600
Your infrastructure is spoilt not only by these\h\h

212
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:17,080
pseudo people [but] also by so many\h
other things which we have taken to:\h\h

213
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:29,440
the society, the family life, the addictions, the\h
habits, and so many things have crawled into us\h\h

214
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:44,160
and have woven such a net that\h
to get out of it is not possible.

215
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,960
There’s only one way to get out of it.

216
00:22:53,680 --> 00:23:01,520
Once, as a child, I had read a story\h
about some birds: A net was cast,\h\h

217
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:10,640
and so many birds, doves,\h
they were caught in the net.

218
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,400
And they discovered that,\h
“We are misled, misguided."

219
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,280
They saw some grains and they were misguided.

220
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,800
So how to get out of the net?

221
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,000
Was impossible for them.

222
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,600
Is an impossibility.

223
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,360
One person cannot get out.

224
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:40,000
One person tries to get out, others get\h
more entangled and he gets even worse.

225
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,520
So what to do?

226
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:49,840
They all said, “Why not we all\h
fly out with the net itself?

227
00:23:51,920 --> 00:24:02,880
And then with our beaks we’ll cut out this net,\h
and we’ll be freed, but first get out from here.

228
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,880
Put our energy together, all\h
of us and let’s fly out."

229
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,360
And that’s what they did.

230
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:17,840
They spread their wings, all of\h
them put together, and took off.

231
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,880
And off they went and they were freed.

232
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,520
Today’s Sahaja Yoga is that kind of a trick.

233
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,160
One person cannot work it out – is impossible.

234
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:45,280
If one person has to do it, it’s an impossibility.

235
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:49,040
He has to go and live in a cave permanently.

236
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:56,880
Any one person even endowed\h
with powers like Christ,\h\h

237
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:03,200
comes on this earth is crucified –\h
finished! Three years, He’s crucified.

238
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,880
Nobody understood Him.

239
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:23,360
So we have to have many more, to get out of\h
this net, which is created through the efforts\h\h

240
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:36,760
of these pseudo people, through our\h
stupidity, our wrong doings, misguidances –\h\h

241
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,760
all kinds of problems which are against evolution.

242
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:52,880
One has to become a whole group\h
to lift up the society higher\h\h

243
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:02,000
so that you can really get rid\h
of the shackles of this bondage.

244
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:15,040
Could be there are some gurus in India who\h
are good gurus who are Realised souls, who\h\h

245
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:24,000
have taken many lives to be Realised and they are\h
very clean people, all that is there, no doubt.

246
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:37,840
But they are very few and they all live in the\h
forest hiding in the caves, and even I told them,\h\h

247
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,720
“Why don’t you come down from your hidings?”\h
They said, “It’s better we are safe here."

248
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,520
Their legs are broken, hands are broken.

249
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:52,400
You see people have never tolerated them.

250
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:57,440
So, according to them, after twelve years, I\h
think during all My stay in England perhaps,\h\h

251
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,760
they’ll be better off to come down\h
– people won’t hurt them so much.

252
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:10,800
One fellow was beaten up so much\h
that all his backbone was finished.

253
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,560
So real gurus are just hiding.

254
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:27,000
And the ones who out are just moneymaking\h
propositions – simple thing as that –\h\h

255
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:41,440
because they know how to pamper your ego, to\h
play upon your weaknesses, to make you more\h\h

256
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:49,960
embedded into that net, into that mire, and take\h
full advantage of you, that’s why they are here.

257
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,080
People don’t like it [if I say that].

258
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:59,360
People get identified with that kind\h
of a chain, but that’s not freedom.

259
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:04,800
Freedom is when you really get your\h
own powers which are within you.

260
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,080
You have got your own powers.

261
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:16,160
You have to be your own guru.

262
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,680
You must reach that point\h
from where you guide yourself,\h\h

263
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:29,840
in such a way that the guiding\h
lines become part and parcel of you.

264
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,600
That means in your central nervous system,\h\h

265
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:43,840
in your conscious mind you must\h
feel the existence of the Spirit.

266
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,880
This is what is the evolutionary process.

267
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:57,840
This is what you have to achieve and all\h
other talks are absolutely of no value.

268
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:06,080
Let us face it! There’s no flowery talk\h
needed for it, nothing of the kind.

269
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:06,800
It’s a doing.

270
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,040
Supposing I tell you, alright, if you have to\h\h

271
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:17,920
make such and such cake, you mix this,\h
mix that, mix that, mix that, is alright.

272
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,240
But when you mix that you find\h
a poison is created out of that.

273
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,320
Another person can say, “Alright I’ll mix this,\h\h

274
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,880
mix that and you have the cake,” and there’s\h
no cake nothing, then what do you eat?

275
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:43,840
So all these talks and all these organisations\h
and everything has no meaning of any kind.

276
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:54,160
It doesn’t empower you to be the Spirit.

277
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:58,560
I am not here to denounce anybody\h
or to make anybody low or anything\h\h

278
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:02,480
but what I think that they are wasting their\h
energy and your energy and their energy.

279
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:10,960
Why don’t they accept that for years together\h
they have been doing all this nonsense\h\h

280
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,320
and they have achieved nothing.

281
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:21,840
My main concern is that why don’t they see it?

282
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,720
Why are they so mass-minded?

283
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,280
Why don’t they see it clearly that these people\h\h

284
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,480
haven’t achieved anything and\h
what are we going to achieve?

285
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,720
“What my father did my grandfather did, my\h
great-grandfather did, I am doing the same thing\h\h

286
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:40,240
and I have not achieved anything\h
as they have not achieved anything.

287
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:46,800
Why not?” Every scientific-minded\h
person should think like that.

288
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,720
Every religious person should think that\h\h

289
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:56,000
this religion, if it has any meaning, it’s not\h
giving any fruits [from] what is written in there.

290
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,520
In the Islam, if you read, I don’t\h
know if you people have read Koran,\h\h

291
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,840
but is written that there\h
will be a day of Resurrection.

292
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:10,080
That Resurrection has to take place,\h
has been said by every one of them.

293
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,240
But what about that?

294
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,600
Nobody wants to talk.

295
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,320
They’ll only talk about the day of the doom\h\h

296
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,240
because then they can have a nice\h
money you see frightening you.

297
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,160
“The day of the Doom is coming better give money."

298
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,440
As if God understands your bank accounts.

299
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,280
You haven’t paid any money so far.

300
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,480
Every such artificial type of thing\h\h

301
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:51,360
is accepted by reasonably wise,\h
sensible, educated, mature people\h\h

302
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:00,000
and they find it impossible to get out of it.

303
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,880
This is a clubbing, it’s a mass thing.

304
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:12,480
Know you are an individual just\h
now, to think for yourself.

305
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,240
God has made you an individual.

306
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,920
You are like an egg which is\h
an individual, we can say.

307
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,120
You have to think about it.

308
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,680
You have to judge about it to find out.

309
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:34,480
And then you become the collective and that means\h
you become aware of your collectivity – aware.

310
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,440
Collectivity doesn’t mean mass reaction.

311
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,640
Like ten people start dancing, “Oh\h
that’s a very good cult you know."

312
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,280
What do they do?

313
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,080
They just stand up and dance.

314
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,120
I mean for that, how much do you have to pay?

315
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,400
Only ten pounds, that’s all?

316
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,280
You just go there, take out your\h
clothes and dance, finished.

317
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,080
You get to God.

318
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:00,320
Very simple method, and people believe in it.

319
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,760
I tell you people believe in it.

320
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,360
They believe in all these tall stories.

321
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:10,080
The simple thing they have to\h
see, “Have we become our Spirit?”\h\h

322
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,240
A simple question we should ask\h
ourself, “Is it for our Spirit?

323
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:28,320
Is there any rapport established with that Divine\h
Power?” Have you felt that Divine Power anywhere?

324
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:42,800
And when we are not keeping our minds\h
steady on this point, we can be ruined.

325
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,480
This all this structure gets spoiled,\h
which is a very delicately made,\h\h

326
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:57,200
beautifully made, God has made it the best of\h
all, better than all the trees put together,\h\h

327
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:07,040
all the animals put together, everything,\h
is the epitome of His creation is man.

328
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:15,680
Except for one thing: that he\h
has been given freedom to choose.

329
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,800
It had to go.

330
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,840
That had to be done.

331
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:25,920
If you don’t give freedom at this stage,\h
how can you enter into complete freedom?

332
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,880
If you do not know how to use\h
your freedom…supposing a man\h\h

333
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,720
who doesn’t know how to use his\h
freedom he goes about [with] daggers,\h\h

334
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:44,560
killing this killing that killing that person\h
or starts killing himself, it can be both ways.

335
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,840
There are some who start killing\h
others or start killing themselves.

336
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,880
Will you give him a freedom?

337
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:59,520
Even in a normal way we don’t give him freedom\h
to go about killing others, or killing himself.

338
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:07,040
So he has to have idea of using his\h
freedom towards himself and towards others,\h\h

339
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,680
and that freedom we have to use.

340
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,400
And if we have used it properly, wisely,\h\h

341
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:25,440
then there’s no problem because\h
it’s made so beautifully.

342
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,000
I told you how Kundalini is placed.

343
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:38,680
How She is placed, at the safest\h
point and how She’s coiled up\h\h

344
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:48,560
and how these centres are kept so subtly within\h
your medulla oblongata in your spinal chord.

345
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:55,840
How it is protected and how this Agnya Chakra\h
is placed between pituitary and pineal on the\h\h

346
00:35:55,840 --> 00:36:04,800
optic chiasma point and how the Sahasrara\h
is made so beautifully – is amazing.

347
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:09,040
Only thing [is] the light of Spirit\h
has to come to enlighten all that,\h\h

348
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,840
that’s all, nothing more needed.

349
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:26,160
You have to just choose that, sensibly,\h
that you have to become the Spirit.

350
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:31,840
You cannot force on the\h
organisation of God anything.

351
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,320
He is on His own.

352
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,000
His organisation on His own.

353
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:46,560
Only thing you can do is to enter into His Kingdom\h
and become a part and parcel of that blissful\h\h

354
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,520
domain.

355
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,200
You would never like to change\h
it either, it is so wonderful.

356
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:03,600
It is so protective, is so loving, is\h
so gentle, so kind, so compassionate,\h\h

357
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,160
that you would hate to change that organisation.

358
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,080
But we do! We try to organise God even.

359
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:21,840
For people who think that that\h
is the ultimate you have to seek,\h\h

360
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,800
it’s all arranged to enter\h
into the Kingdom of God.

361
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,760
The time has come.

362
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,960
This is the Day of Resurrection.

363
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,800
These are the Days of Resurrection.

364
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,040
What Christ did,\h\h

365
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:45,040
there are many people…I read the other day one\h
book saying that He never resurrected Himself.

366
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:50,080
These human beings, I must say!\h
They scientifically they ‘proved’.

367
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,440
‘Scientifically’, can you imagine?

368
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,800
Now how can you prove scientifically?

369
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,600
I don’t understand.

370
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,080
According to them He didn’t die.

371
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:03,840
Of course, He cannot die, He’s an Eternal\h
Being I know that part is correct.

372
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,360
But He never died.

373
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:10,000
He died the way a Divine has to die\h\h

374
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,560
but He resurrected Himself as\h
the Divine has to resurrect.

375
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,040
He definitely resurrected Himself.

376
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,520
But these scientists were not there to see.

377
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,120
Then He descended again, that’s\h
a different point altogether.

378
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,280
But He definitely resurrected His Divine Body.

379
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,840
And He had such a beautiful,\h\h

380
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:45,840
confident personality after that, that wherever\h
He went, He left a great imprint on people.

381
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:55,600
And this is the trouble, that they try\h
to prove everything scientifically.

382
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,760
You cannot prove Christ’s\h
resurrection scientifically.

383
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,440
That’s why you cannot deny it either.

384
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:14,320
What He did it on the gross level, at that time,\h
has to happen, in a subtle level within you.

385
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,000
That, he has done, that’s why they\h
say, “You have to pass through Him."

386
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,960
He has done that for you.

387
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:28,640
He has really done it, and we have\h
to see that happening within us.

388
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,320
Not by saying that, “Now we follow Christ."

389
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,960
Alright, you have one big\h
flag: “Followers of Christ,”\h\h

390
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:42,880
“We are all Christian soldiers walking and we\h
believe in Christ and we are all resurrected."

391
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,400
No you are not.

392
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,000
You are not.

393
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:55,520
At the most if you are a good Christian\h
or a good Hindu or a good Muslim, good,\h\h

394
00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:00,080
again I say, then you are well\h
balanced for your resurrection.

395
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:15,200
But if you are not even that,\h
then it’s a problem for me,\h\h

396
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,440
problem for you.

397
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:30,240
But if you have been a good Jew, or a good\h
Christian, or a good Hindu in the sense that\h\h

398
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:34,720
you have kept your sustenance alright you have\h
been a normal person, you have gone through the\h\h

399
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:41,360
central path and you have kept to the central path\h
of life, you are not an extremist, not a person\h\h

400
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:47,920
who does anything abnormal, is a normal\h
person, then you are very good for Realisation.

401
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,840
It’s as simple as that.

402
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:59,840
But the way people have carried\h
this simple method of organising\h\h

403
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:09,840
people into ‘better’ life, into something\h
so absurd like hating each other,\h\h

404
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:13,040
killing each other or all\h
sorts of things, you know.

405
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,600
I mean it has nothing to do with God, believe Me.

406
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:22,000
And “We are the chosen ones and we\h
are the best and we are the selected."

407
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,200
This is self-certificate.

408
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:28,160
You see if I say, “I am the graduate\h
of the Cambridge University,”\h\h

409
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,240
how long can I befool Myself and others?

410
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,840
Which I am not.

411
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:44,960
In the same way we have to really, really\h\h

412
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:57,920
get our certificate from ourselves that\h
we are reborn, not from anybody else.

413
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:05,360
So we boil down to this point: that we have to\h
be really, really very honest with ourselves,\h\h

414
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:16,160
because it is our loss, nobody else’s, that so\h
far we have not achieved that state of Spirit\h\h

415
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:21,200
and that, in all humility\h
we are going to achieve it,\h\h

416
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:26,880
we have to achieve it and we have to\h
accept that this should happen to us.

417
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:35,200
This is so simple, it’s so simple, and so natural.

418
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:40,800
It’s just in the event, that\h
at this time it had to happen.

419
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:49,280
It’s a very simple thing, there’s no complication,\h
if you have not complicated yourself much.

420
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,600
But even if you have,\h\h

421
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:00,160
the Divine Power knows how to\h
disentangle you and work it out.

422
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:14,320
This is the blessing of the Divine\h
where you become the Spirit and then you\h\h

423
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:20,080
reach your absolute from where\h
there is no doubt about anything.

424
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:24,640
If you want to know what happens\h
is that you just start feeling\h\h

425
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:32,160
a cool breeze flowing into your hands,\h
or from your hands, and then [if] you ask\h\h

426
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:40,160
a question, “Is there God?”\h
and the breeze is much more.

427
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:45,440
If you ask about a thug, “Is\h
he a good man?” it stops.

428
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:54,640
The rapport is established with your Spirit,\h
which speaks to you as cool breeze in the hand.

429
00:43:55,360 --> 00:44:04,560
This cool breeze in the hand is the energy of your\h
Spirit flowing by which your diseases get cured,\h\h

430
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:13,600
you can cure the diseases of others, you can raise\h
the Kundalini of others and give them Realisation\h\h

431
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:21,840
and you can enjoy the beauty of nature,\h\h

432
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:32,400
not thinking about it, or grossly valuing\h
it but just enjoying it in a full way.

433
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,160
This is the short and sweet [version].

434
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:45,520
But it’s such a long story,\h
started thousands of years back,\h\h

435
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:51,520
and today, it is just reaching its climax.

436
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,560
The fruit is just going to be formed.

437
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:08,160
It’s just the blossom time has come for\h
this story and if the seekers co-operate,\h\h

438
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,440
I am sure it will work out.

439
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,120
I have all the hopes.

440
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,840
May God bless you all.

441
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:31,840
Have you any questions for me\h\h

442
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:45,840
today?

443
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:59,840
No questions?

444
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:10,160
Why don’t you come, there are lots of seats here,\h
all of you can come and sit down, come along.

445
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:13,840
Need not stand all the way.

446
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,880
Children should sit in the first row.

447
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:34,560
That’s your child?

448
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:36,640
It’s good.

449
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:41,840
It’s born-realised.

450
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,800
So many great children are born in this country.

451
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,880
I don’t know how many understand it.

452
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,120
He, or it is she?

453
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:55,840
Hello.

454
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,000
She wished Me outside.

455
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,840
Now there’s was a gentlemen poor thing\h
he has to look after the child, is it?

456
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,600
Let him bring the child.

457
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:10,960
Children don’t trouble.

458
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:11,920
Just bring them in.

459
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,920
We like them to be in, they just keep quietly.

460
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:24,840
They enjoy it.

461
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:29,520
Yes.

462
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:32,160
Why keep the child?

463
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:36,080
These are all born-realised children to you.

464
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:40,800
They won’t trouble you, sit\h
down, they’ll be very happy here.

465
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:41,520
Leave them alone.

466
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:48,240
Hello, yes, come along, let them play.

467
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,080
Just let them play.

468
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,400
You see they know what to do they are busy people.

469
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,480
They know what to do, they’re busy people.

470
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:05,840
They’re relaxed.

471
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:08,880
Alright.

472
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:11,680
No question really?

473
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:13,520
Sure?

474
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:20,320
No questions?

475
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:20,720
Alright.

476
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,960
So now only one question\h
could be, that how to do it?

477
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,200
Who’ll bell the cat?

478
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:33,840
It’s very simple.

479
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,120
How do you sprout a seed?

480
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:43,280
In the same way, it is done.

481
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:55,840
As you have seen there, that the hands denote\h
all the centres: five, six and seven centres.

482
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:01,840
There’s a handbook also which you\h
can take it and see for yourself.

483
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:05,920
Now some of the people I’ve seen when\h
they take the book you see, they read it\h\h

484
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:09,520
and they get worried about something.

485
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,000
Whatever is written in that book is the truth.

486
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,680
Now we have tried to keep away lots of it,\h\h

487
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:23,360
from people because they want to have\h
the truth, what to see themselves.

488
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,960
Like some people only hear\h
what they want to hear you see.

489
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,720
The rest they don’t hear.

490
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:33,680
But whatever was necessary to be\h
told, has been told in that book,\h\h

491
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:38,320
which should not frighten you in\h
any way or should not bother you.

492
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:49,440
You just see the book and read it if you want,\h
and see for yourself whether it is true or not.

493
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,600
But just do not get worried about that.

494
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:59,520
Is a wrong attitude, because I’m talking about\h
the realm which you have never known before.

495
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,800
This is the area which is unknown to you,\h\h

496
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:10,640
so if you are entering into that area which\h
is unknown to you, you need not just get upset\h\h

497
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:16,320
about it, but see for yourself whatever\h
is written in that book is true or not.

498
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:21,040
Though we have kept out lots\h
of things from there, not to\h\h

499
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,320
upset you because people get upset with anything.

500
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,960
Even if they see a candle they get\h
upset, “Why there’s a candle?”.

501
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:34,720
I said, “Now, what to do?” If electric\h
light is there is alright, but no candle.

502
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,720
If they see this they’ll say, “Why this?”

503
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,080
See everything can make you upset.

504
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:45,360
You have ideas you see, that a person\h
who is going to give you Realisation\h\h

505
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:53,840
should be sitting in some black place, you\h
see, all covered with two horns coming out.

506
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,400
That’s not the thing.

507
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:01,360
I have to be the most normal person,\h
isn’t it, otherwise you won’t accept.

508
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:12,240
So all these ideas you have about people,\h
or some people think that a person who’s\h\h

509
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:18,800
such and such should be of this height,\h
of this width, this face, of this, that.

510
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,880
All this is your own imagination.

511
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:28,640
So we have to keep ourselves open because this\h
realm you have to get into and see for yourself.

512
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:35,840
Just keep yourself open and see for yourself.

513
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,640
Now you have got these five centres,\h
six and seven centres in your hand.

514
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:47,120
Now I’m telling you this, but it doesn’t\h
mean that I’m forcing on you something\h\h

515
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:50,400
or a brainwashing is there, but\h
these centres are there, you see.

516
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,800
If you go to a doctor he’ll tell you about things\h\h

517
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:56,560
and the same way I’m telling you\h
that there are seven centres.

518
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,880
These are the basic centres within us, basic.

519
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,320
And these centres are shown here,\h
did you somebody talk here, Gavin?

520
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,840
So they are shown on here.

521
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:15,760
Now when you put your hands towards Me like this,\h
these sympathetic centres get activated, just like\h\h

522
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:22,800
as you put the seed in a particular manner it\h
sprouts, it’s just like that, there’s nothing,\h\h

523
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,480
so you have to just put the hands.

524
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,560
Now some people have an objection even for that.

525
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:31,200
Now you have come all the\h
way for your Realisation.

526
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,120
What is the harm for putting hands like this?

527
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:34,880
What is the harm?

528
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,560
But even they have objection for that.

529
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:41,200
But if a guru is there they’ll bow\h
to him one thousand and one times,\h\h

530
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:47,120
give him five hundred pounds and again bow\h
to him and go back into lunatic asylum.

531
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,520
I mean I have met many like that.

532
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:58,160
But if you tell them just put your hands like\h
this, because after all the energy has to flow.

533
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:03,920
Apart from that, you have to ask for it.

534
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:08,640
It cannot be forced, because\h
you are a free person,\h\h

535
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:12,640
you are free person not to\h
have it or to have it, alright?

536
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:16,240
But if you have to have it, I\h
mean if you don’t want to have it,\h\h

537
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:17,920
well and good, then we don’t\h
have anything to do with you.

538
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,480
We don’t want to waste our energy\h
with people who don’t want to have it.

539
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:25,200
Just we do not want to waste our\h
energy, because why should we?

540
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,840
If you don’t want to have it,\h
it cannot be forced, you see.

541
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:32,560
It’s not a horse that you can put\h
in the mouth and the horse eats,\h\h

542
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:35,800
it’s not like that, because the\h
taste of this you have never known.

543
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:40,720
You see is a new area into which you\h
have to that is your spiritual area,\h\h

544
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:45,600
for that you have to understand how to get to it.

545
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:48,960
And for that even a small\h
thing like putting the hands,\h\h

546
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:52,160
if people don’t want to do it\h
means they are not seekers at all.

547
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,320
There’s nothing to be frightened.

548
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:58,800
Kundalini doesn’t trouble anyone.

549
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:04,800
We have had thousands of people realised,\h
nobody had any problem, nothing.

550
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:09,840
On the contrary, you feel much better and cured.

551
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,440
Just close your eyes, put\h
both the feet on the ground.

552
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:19,520
That also has a meaning because when I\h
say put both the feet, it has a meaning.

553
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:24,240
I won’t tell you anything that is not necessary,\h
because I have to gain nothing out of it.

554
00:54:26,667 --> 00:54:29,840
Is better to take out if possible\h
but if they are there doesn’t matter.

555
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:34,160
But you see they just little bit\h
you know too many reasons they are.

556
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:39,200
Then sometimes they do, and even\h
the tight things in the waist.

557
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,760
If the waist is very tight,\h\h

558
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:48,960
physically, then this is not proper,\h
you can just loosen it a little bit.

559
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:54,720
But with some people the Kundalini shoots\h
off so fast that whatever may be the type\h\h

560
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:59,120
of way you are sitting or the way you are,\h
whatever you are doing just shoots off.

561
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:19,840
Now, put your hands towards Me\h
like this, and close your eyes.

562
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:36,720
Keep your eyes shut, that is very important\h
to keep your eyes shut, because the Kundalini\h\h

563
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:47,840
when She rises, over the Agnya She dilates your\h
pupils and if it is not closed She won’t rise.

564
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,880
Just keep your eyes shut, it will work out.

565
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:56,600
Keep your eyes shut please,\h
just keep your eyes shut.

566
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:04,720
This is the chance of lives,\h
not of one life, know that.

567
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:12,000
This is what you have been seeking in all your\h
lives and you have to have it, you have to get it.

568
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,840
You must get your own power.

569
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:26,320
Close your eyes.
