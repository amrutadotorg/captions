00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:23.080
… A huge house!

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.780
I thought, she must be an actress&nbsp;
or something, and all that.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.960
She said, “No, it was my husband who was an&nbsp;
actor, he gave me lots of money in divorce”.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.320
I was amazed at her wealth and everything&nbsp;
she had from her husband and she divorced.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.000
She got half of his earning.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.800
Poor man must have toil [unsure] and&nbsp;
all the property has gone to the lady.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.440
Then I went to Los Angeles.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.140
And there met her poor ex-husband in&nbsp;
wretched condition, absolutely wretched!

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.740
So, I said, “How is it your wife is&nbsp;
so rich and how are you so poor?”

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.240
He said, “I made a mistake of&nbsp;
marrying twice and divorcing”.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.880
All his property is lost while these&nbsp;
women doing nothing have become so rich!

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.520
Your laws are funny, I must say, very funny&nbsp;
to women and women are very dominating,

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.640
that’s why they think they can have the&nbsp;
money of the man because they are married.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.560
And that’s why men don’t want to marry&nbsp;
women that’s why they want to marry men.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.800
If they are homosexual, do&nbsp;
they share the property?

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.160
Do you marry homosexuals in the church?

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:32.107
Sahaja Yogi: No. Some places they do and&nbsp;
some laws are becoming adapted to that.

00:01:32.107 --> 00:01:34.520
Shri Mataji: Imagine such a nonsense!

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.840
It’s funny you just look at it, I mean, you have&nbsp;
gone so far into stupidity, you can’t imagine!

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.440
No wonder Christ was riding on a donkey,&nbsp;
really I tell you, all Christian nations&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.200
have become so stupid, so&nbsp;
stupid in their relationship!

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.240
How can you have good&nbsp;
relationships, husband and wife?

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.880
And you’ll be amazed, you see, I&nbsp;
went to [unclear] it’s too much.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.440
They can’t understand a woman living&nbsp;
without a man, now can you imagine?

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.080
I mean, say, now my husband is not with me. He&nbsp;
telephones to me every morning; I talk to him.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.760
We are enjoying our separation&nbsp;
because he thinks how nice I am.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.160
And I think how nice he is to&nbsp;
me. That is how we ponder over.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.640
And when we meet we have a better time.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.160
And a later time, there is one&nbsp;
day he’s going to be New York,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.840
he has told me 10 times that, “Keep your time&nbsp;
free, I’ll be there, we are going to meet”.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.520
We are still like honey-mooning&nbsp;
couple. Really, we are.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.040
And my grand-children also, you see, say that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.560
“Our grandfather and grandmother&nbsp;
are only married yesterday”.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.240
And my children say that,&nbsp;
“These are Romeo and Juliet!”

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.440
Really we are like that. We are really&nbsp;
like Romeo, we don’t think about it.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.440
What is there to think of another man or a woman?

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.680
I don’t understand, I mean, once for all&nbsp;
you have taken a decision, now finished!

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.040
Every moment you want to take a decision&nbsp;
I mean this decision making also is a ego.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.920
Like, you are going in an American car,&nbsp;
you’d better find out where is the door.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.560
You’ll have a separate handle for that.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.600
You enter into a bathroom find out how&nbsp;
to open the tub. That will be separate.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.520
In everything you want to have a&nbsp;
decision, “This I like, that I like”.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.120
In no- there is no standard thing in anything.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.880
Even in husband, every moment you are&nbsp;
changing. Every wife you are changing.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.800
It’s a confusion for children.&nbsp;
I mean, it’s very embarrassing.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.680
For people like us, you see, who have not known&nbsp;
this kind of a thing, it is very embarrassing.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.320
It’s stupid! I mean, if you know it is stupid,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.434
and if you have to live with these&nbsp;
people, it’s so embarrassing, isn’t it?

00:03:38.434 --> 00:03:45.720
It is still stupid, absolutely stupid!&nbsp;
How can you have homosexual relations?

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.560
I don’t understand.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.380
What sort of nonsense it is! You&nbsp;
don’t create even a rat out of it.

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.320
[Laughter]

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:06.000
What a waste of energy! Talking of&nbsp;
sex itself can’t produce even a rat!

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:14.600
It’s useless it’s absolutely [unclear]&nbsp;
Filth [unclear] What, these French people!

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.520
Look at them, they are nothing but&nbsp;
bathroom, they are bathroom culture.

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.160
They have no culture these French,&nbsp;
they have no culture, take it from me.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.720
They are nothing but bathroom culture.&nbsp;
You know, they have no word for awareness.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.600
Can you believe it? They&nbsp;
have no word for awareness,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.200
because they have only bathroom awareness.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.800
They will describe every sort&nbsp;
of an actor of sex and all that.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.751
Every stage they can do it, but they cannot&nbsp;
tell you the stages of our evolution.

00:04:43.751 --> 00:04:50.040
Think of it. Think of these people, they&nbsp;
think they are the diplomatic people.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.680
They are nothing but bathrooms dirty people.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.120
You go anywhere, in a hotel,&nbsp;
you can’t eat your food.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.480
You see a nude woman sitting before&nbsp;
you, you just feel like vomiting.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:06.920
I mean anybody who’s a proper human&nbsp;
being seeing a nude woman must vomit.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:12.680
I mean how do you like this nonsense? Tomorrow,&nbsp;
you’ll be sitting in the WCS and watching people.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:19.280
It’s filth, it’s filth, it’s filth,&nbsp;
take it from me. Get out of it.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:27.320
How do you expect? I mean I really vomit&nbsp;
when I see a [unclear]. I can’t bear it.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.640
On the roads, you go find all these women there.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:37.600
I don’t know. I mean, you&nbsp;
want to see nudity for what?

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.240
And then 65% people are impotent.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.440
You can’t do sex with your mind.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.840
If you start doing that your&nbsp;
Swadhisthana chakra goes amok.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.680
Your sex transforms from there, from&nbsp;
the localized position, to that.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.480
You cannot become a potent&nbsp;
personality. You become impotent.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:05.320
If you use your brain for your&nbsp;
sex, I mean, mad people you are.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:10.060
Tomorrow you start eating food with your nose.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.000
[Laughter]

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.920
I mean, how can you use your brain for&nbsp;
your sex? I mean, just tell me this.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:27.760
You use your rationality. How can you?&nbsp;
I mean, there’s a sex point within you.

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.320
I just can’t understand. I’m&nbsp;
too bad for all these things.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:38.080
But I would say, I understand one thing, it&nbsp;
is filth. It is not human, it is subhuman.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:48.880
I mean this is like Hell. Who can live in&nbsp;
filth? But the worms can live, not human beings.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.360
So much talk, talk, talk, of sex&nbsp;
for what? I don’t understand.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:59.400
We have the population, you just talk.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.400
[Laughter]

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:07.240
We produce and you just talk and produce these&nbsp;
dirty books of pornography this, that nonsense.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:14.520
It’s not good! You have no self-esteem,&nbsp;
that means you have no self-respect.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:20.560
You are not a sex point.&nbsp;
You are not even an animal.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:23.760
You are not even a human&nbsp;
being, but you are a seeker.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:29.320
You are saints. Do you know, thousands&nbsp;
of years, you have been seeking God?

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:39.640
Thousands of years. You are&nbsp;
seekers and do not seek God in sex.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:44.720
You are already sublimated people.&nbsp;
You’re already great people.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:50.360
Do not waste yourself, try to understand.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:55.000
Don’t judge yourself by the standards of&nbsp;
these dirty people who are around you.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:06.320
You are special, you are very special. You are&nbsp;
the ones who are going to evolve the whole world.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.760
And these are all monkeys, I think. I don’t&nbsp;
know what to call. Monkeys are more sensible.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:13.960
I wouldn’t call them monkeys even. But I don’t&nbsp;
know what to say that, monkeys don’t do like this,

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:19.120
that the male monkey goes about with a male.&nbsp;
In any species, have you seen this nonsense?

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:25.440
Except for earthworm which has both&nbsp;
the sexes. Earthworms, possible.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:29.240
But they also do not do some of&nbsp;
the things that you people do.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:42.840
What is there to learn from the animals?&nbsp;
Tell me. This courting, I was surprised.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:46.200
We had one horrible Sahaja Yogi, he came to us.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:53.400
He spoiled five girl’s vibrations,&nbsp;
five. And he was courting them.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:58.680
I said, “What is this courting? You have no&nbsp;
self-respect? You’re running after every woman!

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:05.040
What sort of a man you are? A man must&nbsp;
stand up and he should get his wife,

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:12.160
not running after this woman, always pleasing her,&nbsp;
fixing up her breakfast running after her, why?

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:16.880
Are you a dog or a human being?&nbsp;
Only in the animal kingdom,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:20.520
the male has to be beautiful,&nbsp;
not in the human kingdom.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:24.720
In the animal kingdom, always&nbsp;
the male is the beautiful one.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:30.280
In the human kingdom, the woman is the beautiful&nbsp;
one. Here the man behaves like an animal!

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:34.520
I mean, nowhere I’ve heard, I mean,&nbsp;
I’m very limited, because I must say,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.600
in India, you don’t hear such a situation.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:41.080
I mean you don’t hear such a situation&nbsp;
that a man is running after a woman.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.880
First time that Gavin came to London,&nbsp;
he came and told me this news.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:50.269
There, it is just the opposite!

00:09:50.269 --> 00:09:52.560
All right. You have your self-respect or not?

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:57.120
And I read it in this ‘Mexican dancing’&nbsp;
that the courting is learned from turkey,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.800
the male turkey courts the female turkey.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.800
Just see, these are turkeys or what?

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:05.320
[Laughter]

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:14.960
You should stand upon your self-respect. The&nbsp;
girl has to put the garland into your neck.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:19.320
That’s why no wonder the women dominate you&nbsp;
the way you behave slavishly towards them.

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:26.160
I must tell you no use forming all these&nbsp;
associations of men and liberation of men.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.040
Now I’ve heard that there is&nbsp;
a liberation of men started!

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:38.560
You are two parts and parcel of one being.

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:46.860
You have to love each other, enjoy&nbsp;
each other. It’s such a special thing.

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:56.280
You have to care for each other. It’s such a&nbsp;
great thing you’re missing, such a great thing.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:06.200
Hurt each other, say harsh things to each other-&nbsp;
or you should see an Indian husband’s wife.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:10.620
Say, for example, in the presence of&nbsp;
elders, we won’t even look at each other.

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:13.320
And my eyes will be lower&nbsp;
and his eyes will be lower.

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:17.240
He may just turn around and see&nbsp;
me, that’s all, that I’m there.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:29.120
He may not even say goodbye to me. But deep&nbsp;
down, in the heart, we are feeling each other.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.260
So much oneness, so much oneness.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:40.080
And when he got first elected, you see, and&nbsp;
he said, “I couldn’t see all that without you.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:43.477
I just couldn’t see”. He went to&nbsp;
the telephone, he telephoned to me.

00:11:43.477 --> 00:11:49.320
He said, “I wish you here. Just to enjoy that”.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:55.200
Such silent companionship.&nbsp;
Such beautiful understanding.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:59.840
Of course, sometimes, you must quarrel&nbsp;
also. But quarrel is the other way around.

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:04.520
Like, he will buy something very expensive for me.&nbsp;
So, I’ll say, Why did you waste so much money?”

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:11.600
“First time I bought this for you. Now why you&nbsp;
say that to me?” It’s that kind of a quarrel.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:18.400
What I should do for him, and what he should&nbsp;
do for me, is the quarrel. It’s different.

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.000
In Sahaja Yoga, we have that companionship.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.200
We have many now young couples like&nbsp;
that. You’ll be amazed they are.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.840
If they are not possessed. But&nbsp;
they get possessed very soon as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:31.200
soon as the marriage is declared&nbsp;
they get possessed, in the West.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:39.480
It’s a big headache for me because&nbsp;
they have a fear of the marriage.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:43.800
But there will be very good&nbsp;
relationships with the people also.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:47.120
And very good marriages, very good families.

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:54.960
Especially because the great people are&nbsp;
going to be born to these great Sahaja Yogis.

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:58.800
There are so many, so many&nbsp;
of them wanting to be born.

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:02.880
So, all the children, nowadays, I see&nbsp;
born to Sahaja Yogis are born Realised.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:09.400
So, all these children are to be born to&nbsp;
you. They are just waiting for a chance.

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:14.880
And they are going to build&nbsp;
this great empire of God.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:22.360
So, you have to lead a life of love,&nbsp;
affection, give and take, and enjoyment.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:26.800
Marriage is for enjoyment and&nbsp;
not for quarrelling, not at all.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.920
What is money? We are not going&nbsp;
to take it with us, are we?

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:38.680
Really, I don’t know how you&nbsp;
people think about money, but,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:41.760
I mean, we are not so conscious of in India.

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:45.440
We don’t understand the value of money so much.

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:51.800
Perhaps we are not so much aware, but&nbsp;
we don’t understand. We understand love.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:58.160
We understand affection. But you had these great&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:04.920
qualities in you once upon a&nbsp;
time, I know, you had them.

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:08.200
And you’ll again revive them,&nbsp;
definitely. You’ll revive them.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:14.520
And you come from such ancient&nbsp;
personalities that that will come up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:17.280
as soon as you become Realized souls.

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:21.960
Then the giving, it will be joyful&nbsp;
and a very great understanding.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:28.360
But I would say, Americans should&nbsp;
marry Australians. [Laughter]

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:33.720
And Australians should marry English.&nbsp;
And English should marry. That is better.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:39.320
So, that there is more understanding and there&nbsp;
is a little curiosity to know each other.

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:43.600
Because otherwise, they have formula:&nbsp;
“If you say this, I’ll say this”.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:49.560
It’s all so sorted out, you see. By the time it&nbsp;
is 1 month, you must end up into the divorce case.

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:54.040
The whole thing is out. One by one, by one.&nbsp;
But today he said so, that one said so.

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:58.880
I mean in the- if you see any film, most&nbsp;
of it is fighting between husband and wife.

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:04.000
We get fed up! The husband&nbsp;
says so, the wife says so.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:10.360
I mean, is there no love? All&nbsp;
Romeo Juliet is finished or what?

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:16.840
We are going to have very sweet married&nbsp;
lives beautiful, ideal, I tell you,

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:28.582
where the women don’t get any breast&nbsp;
cancers and men don’t run away from house.

00:15:28.582 --> 00:15:28.600
[Realisation part]

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:32.660
Yes, it is true, I see that part.&nbsp;
Should we have Realization now?

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:35.040
Gavin: Slip your shoes off.

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:43.280
For the new people that have come, this is to&nbsp;
earth you, to allow the vibrations to flow.

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:48.947
Just simply hold your hands&nbsp;
up. Rest them on your leg

00:15:48.947 --> 00:15:51.160
Shri Mataji: You’ll be empowered,&nbsp;
you see, to do all these things.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:56.713
You’ll be empowered with love. You’ll have&nbsp;
so much love that you can’t imagine be.

00:15:56.713 --> 00:16:13.120
He has so much love, so much of love.

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:16.560
Today, I think, you all will get&nbsp;
Realization without any difficulty.

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.760
Already, you must be feeling&nbsp;
it. It’s tremendous today.

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:28.520
My brain is really- please close&nbsp;
your eyes. Just close your eyes.

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:31.760
You don’t have to do anything. You just feel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:42.440
the cool breeze, that’s all.&nbsp;
Then I’ll tell you what it is.

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:48.160
Just close your eyes, don’t do anything. Just&nbsp;
close your eyes and leave your attention free.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:53.960
Don’t fix it up anywhere, just don’t. If&nbsp;
you have not damaged yourself too much,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:55.840
I’m sure it should work.

00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:00.480
Just it’s too much. The power is too much.

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:28.400
Shri Mataji [to Gavin]: Just put your hand [on&nbsp;
Shri Mataji’s Back Agnya]. See, it’s tremendous.

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:58.440
Keep your eyes shed. Just keep your eye shed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:02.040
because Kundalini won’t rise above&nbsp;
your Agnya if your eyes are not shut.

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:13.520
Please keep them shut.

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:16.080
Now on top of your head, you&nbsp;
can feel the cool breeze.

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.360
Those who can feel it, just feeling it. Just put&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:25.720
your right hand on top of your&nbsp;
head, it’s flowing so much.

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:32.440
Just move your hand and see on your&nbsp;
head. Just move forward and backward.

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:52.997
Higher than your head you put&nbsp;
it, then you will feel it.

00:18:52.997 --> 00:18:54.960
Shri Mataji [to Gavin]: It’s&nbsp;
tremendous. Most of them are feeling.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:59.440
Now put your heads towards me, just like this.&nbsp;
And see if you are feeling in your hands [unclear]

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:10.920
Relax your, relax your shoulders&nbsp;
and put your hands. Relax.

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:18.360
Shri Mataji [to Gavin]: It’s too much, he?&nbsp;
What a [unclear] It has turn to left now.

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:19.120
All right.

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:22.880
Are you feeling the feeing the cool breeze?&nbsp;
Put the hands towards me, like this, straight.

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:29.240
Like this, not like this but&nbsp;
this way as if you’re asking .

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:39.240
This is just the beginning. But you must&nbsp;
establish yourself deeper and deeper into it.

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:44.960
Luckily, now we have some people&nbsp;
here, who want to start a Center.

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:55.960
You all have to give your names to these&nbsp;
people and do not just get lost. Work it out.

00:19:55.960 --> 00:20:04.880
Those who are not feeling cool breeze&nbsp;
have to raise their hands. Please stand.

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:12.120
Why? Together you are not&nbsp;
feeling? [Unclear] All right.

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:20.600
Please raise your hands. Higher, like&nbsp;
this. Why, why are you not feeling?

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.400
You are all right.

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:28.160
Seeker: I’m very hot.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.626
Shri Mataji: Very hot.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:40.160
Gavin: Ekadesha Rudra is catching.

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.630
Shri Mataji [to Gavin]: Hum?

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:42.664
Gavin: Ekadesha Rudra is catching.

00:20:42.664 --> 00:20:47.000
Hum. These too. Now better? It will work out.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.760
Who else is not feeling there? You?

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:55.880
Now are you all right?

00:20:55.880 --> 00:21:01.920
See these gentlemen. It’s all right. Just&nbsp;
put your hand and see if he is feeling.

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:06.720
Or you just see his head. The Sahaja Yogis&nbsp;
should see others now. It’s all right.

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:18.080
This is the guru’s, you see,&nbsp;
you have to get rid of him.

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:24.200
And Christine will tell you how to do&nbsp;
it tonight. All right? They come back.

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:33.440
Ask him to put the right hand on the&nbsp;
[unclear.] Just see all of them one by one.

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:38.640
You can also do this once you&nbsp;
are Realised. Are you all right?

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:46.720
[Unclear conversation with a seeker]

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:52.880
You very happy. I wish you were today in,&nbsp;
today, in [unclear; Cornish town?] come.

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:56.960
Today was such a great day. It&nbsp;
worked very well with everyone.

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:59.587
Seeker: Tonight it happened just&nbsp;
from the word though. [Unsure]

00:21:59.587 --> 00:22:00.400
Shri Mataji: Hum?

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:02.427
Seeker: On the spoken word it happened. [Unsure]

00:22:02.427 --> 00:22:08.120
Shri Mataji: It happened. Yes, today I’m just&nbsp;
filled with it. It’s too much. It was too much.

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:10.640
Are you all right?

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:17.120
Are you all right now? What’s the matter

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.480
All right we’ll see him.

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:23.200
See all of them one by one. See this side.

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:24.520
Are you all right now Barbara?

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:27.960
Barbara: Oh, yes. You come and see this gentleman.&nbsp;
Can you tell me what are the centres catching?

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:30.520
All of them, one by one.

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:36.840
Everybody should take one row.
