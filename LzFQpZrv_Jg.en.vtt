00:00.135 --> 00:14.679
To all the seekers of truth, My salutations to you all!

00:14.704 --> 00:22.493
In India the seeking of truth has been going on since time imemmorial.

00:22.518 --> 00:26.491
This we can know from our scriptures.

00:26.516 --> 00:33.540
And we have found the truth through various resources.

00:33.565 --> 00:40.613
Our country is spiritualistic in a special sense.

00:40.638 --> 00:47.403
The reason for that is that in our country many things are accessible to us.

00:47.428 --> 00:53.343
We don't know, how much prosperous is our country

00:53.434 --> 00:56.612
and how much holy it is.

00:56.637 --> 01:05.968
And the people here are how much simple and clean.

01:05.993 --> 01:11.126
We used to call foreigners 'malechch'

01:11.151 --> 01:16.458
because we noticed that those who came here

01:16.483 --> 01:19.517
their all desires go towards 'malla'(impure desires).

01:19.542 --> 01:23.869
In our time, now I have grown old

01:23.894 --> 01:34.048
it was noticed that how much shallow these foreigners are?

01:34.073 --> 01:37.739
That overall, how much shallow their vision is?

01:37.764 --> 01:42.951
That how much shallow were their desires?

01:42.976 --> 01:53.327
By and by, this western culture influenced our country men tremendously.

01:53.351 --> 01:56.211
The reason for that was for three hundred years

01:56.236 --> 01:59.023
these people ruled over our heads

01:59.048 --> 02:02.138
and gradually, we started understanding

02:02.163 --> 02:07.874
that they are very great who have come into our country

02:07.899 --> 02:10.784
and are ruling over us.

02:10.809 --> 02:18.040
Actually, they got their work done by befooling us.

02:18.065 --> 02:20.463
And secondly, because of our rituals

02:20.488 --> 02:29.172
and because of many other strange rituals and evils in our society

02:29.197 --> 02:33.348
we became cultureless.

02:33.373 --> 02:41.729
our culture started dying, specially in North India.

02:41.754 --> 02:49.960
I could never think of having so many disciples in front of Me.

02:49.985 --> 02:56.059
Its reason might be that you must have been a great seeker in your past life

02:56.084 --> 02:58.562
and you might have done a great deal of meditation

02:58.587 --> 03:05.626
that today, you suddenly were eager to know the truth.

03:05.651 --> 03:11.697
Even though every type of person in charge of religion

03:11.722 --> 03:15.210
and in the same way false people

03:15.235 --> 03:21.368
had spread so much of false information in the country

03:21.393 --> 03:24.384
and so many people had followed them

03:24.480 --> 03:27.547
but today such a time has come

03:27.572 --> 03:32.627
that people think of knowing the truth only.

03:32.652 --> 03:42.202
And to know what is the definition of truth?

03:42.227 --> 03:49.168
If I tell you what is truth, you should not believe Me

03:49.193 --> 03:51.542
just because I am saying it.

03:51.567 --> 03:54.950
But you should verify it.

03:54.975 --> 03:58.603
The fact is that you are

03:58.628 --> 04:09.217
not this body, intellect, mind, ego and bad conditionings etc.

04:09.242 --> 04:14.899
but you yourself are the pure spirit.

04:14.924 --> 04:16.959
What is Atma?

04:16.984 --> 04:26.435
'Atma' is the reflection of God Almighty.

04:26.460 --> 04:30.346
You are that, you have to become that

04:30.371 --> 04:35.029
and whatever else is there is all useless.

04:35.054 --> 04:39.010
Because till you do not recognize yourself

04:39.035 --> 04:46.922
till then, you cannot know the reality of anything.

04:46.947 --> 04:48.489
Mohammad saheb has said

04:48.514 --> 04:53.931
‘If you have not recognised yourself, then you cannot recognise God’.

04:53.956 --> 05:06.131
So one should first recognize oneself.

05:06.156 --> 05:15.636
Means that 'Recognition' is a special state.

05:15.661 --> 05:18.385
Today, you are in human state

05:18.410 --> 05:25.599
and beyond human state, there must be surely some other state.

05:25.624 --> 05:33.637
Otherwise, the nuisance that we are witnessing in the world now a days

05:33.662 --> 05:40.245
and all the type of destructive, corrupt set-ups that we are witnessing

05:40.270 --> 05:47.788
there must be some such solution

05:47.813 --> 05:53.845
that will lead to man's salvation.

05:53.870 --> 05:58.454
All sages and saints talked about their salvation

05:58.479 --> 06:02.944
and all the great incarnations also talked about them.

06:02.969 --> 06:11.304
Then, when and how, will that salvation take place?

06:11.329 --> 06:15.523
It is not that I talked about this Sahaj system.

06:15.548 --> 06:20.963
It is since time immemorial that it is called 'Sahaj'.

06:20.988 --> 06:26.349
What we have to achieve is 'Sahaj'.

06:26.374 --> 06:35.047
But in the ancient times, there were such people who misguided the people.

06:35.072 --> 06:38.090
Read this book, you will get it

06:38.115 --> 06:40.807
take bath in Gangaji, and you will get it

06:40.839 --> 06:45.227
or do some other nuisance and it will happen.

06:45.252 --> 06:51.420
They influenced people with such a variety of devices..........

06:51.445 --> 06:54.691
completely covered them, and filled their minds.

06:54.716 --> 06:58.037
Now there is a small thing like ‘Satya-Narayan puja’.

06:58.062 --> 07:00.632
People do not use their brains that

07:00.657 --> 07:07.328
when Narayan is truth itself, why there is the need to add ‘Satya’ (truth)?

07:07.345 --> 07:11.682
All these blind practices kept on happening here.

07:11.707 --> 07:13.762
It happened so not only in Hindu Dharma

07:13.787 --> 07:15.656
It was more than this among Chritians also

07:15.681 --> 07:18.591
and more than that among Muslims.

07:18.616 --> 07:21.242
They stuck themselves in the traditional beliefs

07:21.267 --> 07:26.716
that will never help them to get their salvation, never, never.

07:26.741 --> 07:29.941
But what has been said is that

07:29.966 --> 07:39.579
it is inside you only and search that, attain that.

07:39.604 --> 07:43.256
Everybody forgets that.

07:43.281 --> 07:47.546
Firstly, the feminine conduct

07:47.571 --> 07:50.079
that we will not take this thing, we will not take that thing

07:50.104 --> 07:57.157
will shave off their heads and will not put any cloth on their body

07:57.182 --> 08:01.682
God will not be attained.

08:01.707 --> 08:05.692
One should think of an ordinary and simple thing

08:05.717 --> 08:08.775
that God is your father.

08:08.800 --> 08:13.090
Will any father want that his son should die of hunger?

08:13.115 --> 08:15.841
And the one who is father of father

08:15.866 --> 08:18.708
one who is father of all fathers

08:18.733 --> 08:23.042
from whom we get nature of the father, we achieve fatherhood.

08:23.067 --> 08:32.200
will God want that you shave off your heads and die of hunger?

08:32.225 --> 08:37.805
But man doesn't think of Dharma

08:37.837 --> 08:43.723
that what is the use of Dharma we are following?

08:43.748 --> 08:47.444
What did we get out of that?

08:47.469 --> 08:54.278
I know that all those who are followers of Dharma

08:54.303 --> 09:00.219
those who go in for most difficullt penance

09:00.244 --> 09:08.717
they are so ill tempered that it is difficult to approach them.

09:08.742 --> 09:13.083
And even if you go, take some wood with you

09:13.108 --> 09:18.034
because they get angry in no time.

09:18.059 --> 09:22.014
Recently, I have written the reason for it.

09:22.039 --> 09:24.949
What is the scientific reason for it?

09:24.974 --> 09:33.497
The scientific reason for this is that our genes inside us have a database.

09:33.522 --> 09:37.030
It has got three things.

09:37.055 --> 09:41.712
One is Carbohydrates, one is Nitrogen and one is Phosphorus.

09:41.737 --> 09:50.199
When asceticism awakens into us

09:50.224 --> 09:55.121
then, water within us gets lost because it burns.

09:55.146 --> 09:59.345
The water in the parts of the cells is also lost.

09:59.370 --> 10:04.340
If the phosphorus is removed from water, then it flares up.

10:04.365 --> 10:08.081
That is why people flare up.

10:08.106 --> 10:16.936
This type of asceticism is too much against peace.

10:16.961 --> 10:20.946
Because the physical activity is like that.

10:20.971 --> 10:27.514
So, you must have seen, there was a saint Durvasa who used to curse.

10:27.539 --> 10:33.602
He knew only to curse. I have not heard that he  gave salvation to anyone.

10:33.627 --> 10:37.319
It is not spirituality.

10:37.344 --> 10:45.859
The light of the spirit doesn't work in one direction. It is all around us.

10:45.884 --> 10:56.300
And such a person is calm in his peace and glory.

10:56.325 --> 10:58.346
To get into this state

10:58.371 --> 11:05.713
give up this, give up that, there is no need to give up anything.

11:05.738 --> 11:12.801
Whatever exists in this world is in its own place.

11:12.826 --> 11:17.256
The moment you know your spirit

11:17.281 --> 11:22.226
when it will happen with your kundalini awakening

11:22.251 --> 11:28.542
then you will see, you are  related to everyone.

11:28.567 --> 11:31.962
And such poetry will come to your mind

11:31.987 --> 11:33.920
such things will come to your mind

11:33.945 --> 11:38.669
such subtle, which you had never thought of.

11:38.694 --> 11:41.402
you have never seen

11:41.427 --> 11:52.256
you must have never bothered, must have never come to your mind.

11:52.281 --> 11:59.258
To get into this state, earlier people used to try various methods

11:59.283 --> 12:06.588
would give regard to gurus and try a lot, but it didn't work.

12:06.613 --> 12:13.712
It is absolutely correct, that the awakening of Kundalini is very difficult.

12:13.737 --> 12:16.093
And one thing

12:16.118 --> 12:22.221
Somebody asked Shree Ram Das Swami, Who was guru of Shivaji

12:22.246 --> 12:25.053
how much time does Kundalini awakening take?

12:25.078 --> 12:30.897
His reply was, 'TATCHAN', at that very moment!

12:30.922 --> 12:36.501
But there must be a receiver as well as a giver.

12:36.526 --> 12:42.192
I can see the people, who want to receive it, sitting in front of Me

12:42.217 --> 12:45.273
And the time is like that.

12:45.298 --> 12:50.472
During this time, the humans struggle so much.

12:50.497 --> 13:00.575
This period of the the horrible activities of Kaliyuga

13:00.600 --> 13:08.848
is in fact horrible time of people.

13:08.872 --> 13:17.719
keeping enmity with each other, troubling each other, opressing each other

13:17.744 --> 13:23.286
that may be in the household or outside

13:23.311 --> 13:29.756
may be in politics or in any other field

13:29.781 --> 13:32.347
it will be so.

13:32.372 --> 13:37.691
And many people do not even realise that they are doing something wrong

13:37.716 --> 13:43.534
opressing someone or beating someone.

13:43.559 --> 13:46.177
And this is happening in every religion.

13:46.202 --> 13:50.963
There is no such religion where there is no beating , no problem.

13:50.988 --> 13:54.716
And the people are nor not ready to accept that

13:54.741 --> 13:58.395
their religion is not superior to all the religions

13:58.420 --> 14:00.622
is not a special religion.

14:00.647 --> 14:05.773
If your religion is such a good religion, then why are you dying?

14:05.798 --> 14:08.504
Why is there such a situation?

14:08.529 --> 14:11.385
why are you in trouble?

14:11.410 --> 14:14.279
Our religion is the highest of all the religions.

14:14.304 --> 14:16.561
Had you taken birth in another religion

14:16.586 --> 14:19.613
you would have talked the same thing about that dharma.

14:19.728 --> 14:22.768
That means , fighting for the sake of dharma

14:22.793 --> 14:29.225
is an insult to God, very great insult.

14:29.250 --> 14:32.235
That was a time and based on the requirements of those times

14:32.260 --> 14:34.924
people have spoken those things.

14:34.949 --> 14:40.743
just by interchanging, manipulating and getting other things to the forefront

14:40.768 --> 14:48.127
and to fight in the name of God, there is no greater sin than this.

14:48.152 --> 14:51.504
To kill others in the name of God

14:51.529 --> 14:56.116
to beat others in the name of God

14:56.141 --> 15:04.986
The God who  is forgiving, merciful, ocean of kindness

15:05.011 --> 15:10.931
doing such heinous acts in HIS name

15:10.956 --> 15:14.657
insult of any dharma.

15:14.682 --> 15:18.340
What for are they fighting?

15:18.365 --> 15:21.016
somebody fighting for land

15:21.041 --> 15:27.504
Such people who believe in formless are fighting for land

15:27.529 --> 15:36.074
If you believe in formless, why are are fighting for land? Give it up.

15:36.099 --> 15:40.281
But by saying this nothing is going to happen.

15:40.306 --> 15:47.335
Those who said so was ineffective. Did anyone listen to that?

15:47.360 --> 15:48.890
Nobody agreed to.

15:48.915 --> 15:53.954
It remained as a mere speech, as a mere talk, as a mere lecture.

15:53.979 --> 16:00.018
It had no impact.

16:00.043 --> 16:07.709
The reason is that man is lying in the darkness, of  ignorance.

16:07.734 --> 16:15.058
Kabir said ,"How shall I make it understand that the whole world is blind."

16:15.083 --> 16:18.378
This was the problem, in this Delhi.

16:18.403 --> 16:24.242
I used to think that it is useless to break one's head here.

16:24.267 --> 16:28.153
And in that Delhi only

16:28.178 --> 16:31.790
in my present state I see that.

16:31.815 --> 16:38.086
Do not know, in which words shall I express My joy.

16:43.233 --> 16:45.200
When I would talk about Kundalini, they would say

16:45.225 --> 16:49.268
"Do you see the Horoscope? I will get My Horoscope."

16:49.293 --> 16:54.873
How it will happen here? Don't know.

16:54.898 --> 16:56.859
How will it accomplish?

16:56.884 --> 16:59.867
But later, I found that

16:59.892 --> 17:07.036
that here there must have been some great saints of previous births, some seekers.

17:07.061 --> 17:13.579
They must be some great religious people, who have come to Delhi

17:13.604 --> 17:21.799
and now they desire to get their spirit.

17:21.824 --> 17:28.197
The desire they had in their previous births, has awakened today.

17:28.222 --> 17:29.783
Otherwise, I would not have understood.

17:29.808 --> 17:34.248
I got married in Delhi and I would think, "Oh God! what a city it is?"

17:34.273 --> 17:35.794
Here the people

17:35.819 --> 17:42.891
except dresses, Jewellery, money and politics would not talk about anything .

17:42.916 --> 17:48.048
And nobody talks, nobody asks you anything.

17:48.073 --> 17:55.236
And in that very Delhi, You have come to get your self realization.

17:55.261 --> 17:58.928
This is the great fortune of this country.

17:58.953 --> 18:01.411
It is its good luck.

18:01.436 --> 18:05.732
Because India is a very great country.

18:05.757 --> 18:08.471
It is a YOG BHUMI.

18:08.496 --> 18:11.950
But we don't know anything about this country.

18:11.975 --> 18:17.097
When we don't know anything about this country, how can we love it?

18:17.122 --> 18:19.718
How can we be vigilant about it?

18:19.743 --> 18:23.585
I am so surprised, that a place like London, where I used to live

18:23.610 --> 18:26.343
there, a city called England, is only this much.

18:26.368 --> 18:29.364
In that one should say

18:29.389 --> 18:31.910
not as much as India

18:31.935 --> 18:34.333
very few people

18:34.358 --> 18:38.446
but everyone knows the minutest details

18:38.471 --> 18:45.550
agrees to everything

18:45.575 --> 18:47.995
and very gracefully.

18:48.020 --> 18:52.220
As such there is nothing so great, is a fact.

18:52.245 --> 18:57.181
I asked someone, "Where did you purchase this glass bowl?"

18:57.206 --> 19:01.885
Immediately he said,"It is available there at that place in North

19:01.910 --> 19:04.496
and there is a factory where it is manufactured."

19:04.521 --> 19:06.591
I was so surprised.

19:06.663 --> 19:12.218
There neighbours do not talk among themselves.

19:12.243 --> 19:19.161
And everybody knows that this country knows everything

19:19.186 --> 19:22.576
he may be educated or uneducated or anything.

19:22.601 --> 19:26.126
There was a lady in a village, we went to her home.

19:26.151 --> 19:28.915
She didn't know, where is Russia situated?

19:28.947 --> 19:34.111
But about London, although She lived in a village

19:34.136 --> 19:38.908
about the whole country, you know how small it is

19:38.933 --> 19:43.686
she knew each and everything.

19:43.711 --> 19:50.856
But in our country, we have become westernised, although we live in India.

19:50.881 --> 19:57.669
or what happened don't know. Nobody knows anything about anyone

19:57.694 --> 20:00.666
talking ill about neighbours.

20:00.691 --> 20:04.325
I am talking about the past, not about the present.

20:04.350 --> 20:07.031
And ask them anything, they say, "We don't know."

20:07.056 --> 20:08.564
very angrily!

20:08.589 --> 20:11.462
Where does this and this person live?

20:11.487 --> 20:14.609
Hey! is he a clerk?

20:14.634 --> 20:19.294
I don't know, but this is the address. Oh! it is the residential area of clerks.

20:19.319 --> 20:23.780
So, who are you? I am head clerk. I said o.k.

20:23.805 --> 20:28.725
In this way ,there is so much of pride, Oh My God!

20:28.750 --> 20:34.809
And wherever I looked at, even the smallest issues

20:34.834 --> 20:41.772
everybody had a great pride that i am so and so.

20:41.797 --> 20:44.585
The same is the case with old Delhi.

20:44.610 --> 20:47.544
The same is the case with New Delhi.

20:47.569 --> 20:51.864
"And what they were proud of, I don't know."

20:51.889 --> 20:58.761
But there was in a way, such an environment

20:58.786 --> 21:04.653
which is called 'Sabhrant'. 'illuson', 'Sabhrant'

21:04.678 --> 21:10.707
Everyone was in an illusion. ‘I am this, I am that, I am like that’.

21:10.732 --> 21:14.444
If you go to Old Delhi

21:14.469 --> 21:17.691
and if you ask, 'Where is that shop?'

21:17.716 --> 21:21.097
Why 'Saheb', What is wrong with our shop? Sit here.

21:21.122 --> 21:25.446
If you talk like this, who will sit in your shop?

21:25.471 --> 21:32.358
So much of struggle, so much mutual hatered  and so much mutual evil.

21:32.383 --> 21:38.985
Same Delhi wants to be well organized, to love each other.

21:39.010 --> 21:45.359
That integration should be achieved, which is the gift of God.

21:45.384 --> 21:48.124
You only tell Me, how must I be feeling?

21:48.149 --> 21:50.671
I have seen a lot of this world.

21:50.696 --> 22:04.574
I salute these people of Dehli, a thousand times.

22:04.598 --> 22:08.479
Now you understand your responsibilities as well.

22:08.504 --> 22:11.827
You live in such a city

22:11.852 --> 22:18.625
because of which, our India's fame is known througout the world.

22:18.650 --> 22:25.304
Whatever happens in Delhi is known all over the world.

22:25.329 --> 22:27.300
What is happening here?

22:27.325 --> 22:28.395
The people of this city say

22:28.420 --> 22:33.363
if one person dies anywhere in Delhi, it will be known in the whole world

22:33.388 --> 22:38.701
and if twenty five peolpe die in any other country, doesn't matter.

22:38.726 --> 22:44.073
So, that means you are very important

22:44.099 --> 22:51.808
and your importance is that you are the representatives of this country.

22:51.832 --> 22:56.963
You are the representatives of this Yog Bhumi, this India.

22:56.988 --> 23:01.627
Today, you have come for your self realization.

23:01.652 --> 23:04.081
Or, many have got it also.

23:04.106 --> 23:08.082
But, you must understand

23:08.107 --> 23:15.317
that those who are self realized, they have got their special position.

23:15.342 --> 23:20.127
And I agree a special position of the people of Delhi.

23:20.152 --> 23:23.706
You are sitting in the capital

23:23.731 --> 23:29.219
and in this capital, those who will be self realized souls

23:29.244 --> 23:32.475
those who will achieve their spirit

23:32.500 --> 23:39.720
they will have a special glamorous power

23:39.745 --> 23:42.450
NOT CLEAR

23:42.475 --> 23:51.737
and that glamorous power is 'love' and 'truth'.

23:51.762 --> 23:55.594
'Truth' and 'Love' both are same.

23:55.619 --> 24:01.531
When you will know the truth, you will yourself become peaceful.

24:01.556 --> 24:05.194
When you know the truth

24:05.219 --> 24:12.638
what is there to get disturbed?

24:12.663 --> 24:14.983
So, do you know what is 'truth'?

24:15.007 --> 24:19.832
But 'Truth' and 'love' both are just the same.

24:19.857 --> 24:27.097
He who knows the 'truth',  knows it only by 'love'.

24:27.122 --> 24:30.251
For example, you love somebody

24:30.276 --> 24:32.194
you know everything about him.

24:32.219 --> 24:35.802
You know, his likes and dislikes

24:35.827 --> 24:38.546
what should we say to him and what we should not say to him

24:38.571 --> 24:42.567
what does he eat, what does he drink, you know everything.

24:42.592 --> 24:45.080
what does he hint at when he says something

24:45.105 --> 24:47.726
everything you know., if you love him

24:47.751 --> 24:50.654
and you are devoted to him.

24:50.679 --> 24:57.723
And when you will know 'truth' by 'love', then only it is 'truth'.

24:57.748 --> 25:04.256
And if you want to take away 'love', 'truth ' will also be no more there.

25:04.281 --> 25:05.671
There can't be, truth'.

25:05.696 --> 25:17.031
Because the radiance of the 'crest of truth' depends only on the 'oil of love'.

25:17.056 --> 25:23.744
Love doesn't mean, i love my daughter, i love my son i love my brother

25:23.769 --> 25:26.033
i love everyone.

25:26.058 --> 25:27.686
This is not 'love'.

25:27.711 --> 25:48.087
For this, there is a word in Sanskrit,'NIRVAJY', 'NIRLRP', means 'detatched'.

25:48.112 --> 25:49.930
And you will say

25:49.955 --> 25:55.386
'Mother, if love becomes selfless, many things will drop off'.

25:55.411 --> 25:57.810
It is not so.

25:57.835 --> 26:00.333
Look at a tree!

26:00.358 --> 26:08.782
Its flow of love, its sap goes to the whole tree.

26:08.807 --> 26:11.537
It goes everywhere.

26:11.562 --> 26:23.626
It goes to its root, to its branches, to its leaves

26:23.651 --> 26:31.289
goes to its fruits but does not stop.

26:31.314 --> 26:38.309
Either it merges into the eather or returns back to earth.

26:38.334 --> 26:42.635
It doesn't stop anywhere.

26:42.660 --> 26:50.453
If it stops, suppose it likes a fruit or a flower very much

26:50.478 --> 26:57.745
the tree will die and that fruit and flower everything will die.

26:57.770 --> 27:03.205
So, whatever you have to give anyone, should be given.

27:03.230 --> 27:13.271
Whatever sap you have to give to your home, household, society

27:13.296 --> 27:20.488
in your country and in the whole world, whosoever you have to give, give.

27:20.513 --> 27:23.248
But don't get glued to it.

27:23.273 --> 27:29.655
Getting glued to that, in a way should be said

27:29.680 --> 27:35.505
what is called in English, 'obsession', clinged.

27:35.530 --> 27:42.220
Now whatever it may be, that weakens  the power of love.

27:42.245 --> 27:44.395
It won't multiply.

27:44.420 --> 27:48.939
It is said ‘ Udaara charitanaam vasudhaiva kutumbakam’,

27:48.964 --> 27:51.005
meaning that the mother earth

27:51.030 --> 27:56.236
the entire creation the entire mother land, is his family.

27:56.261 --> 27:58.282
This is the power of 'love'.

27:58.307 --> 28:01.759
And if you understand this 'power of love'

28:01.784 --> 28:04.786
then , you will be surprised that

28:04.811 --> 28:07.640
it happens when we know our spirit .

28:07.665 --> 28:10.636
I have seen that when people come to Sahajyoga

28:10.661 --> 28:16.407
they first of all find out their own shortcomings.

28:16.432 --> 28:21.846
They come and say,'Mother, I am a great fool. I  have done such mistakes'.

28:21.871 --> 28:25.429
I don't want your confessions, you write down.

28:25.454 --> 28:31.198
‘Then I became like this, I did that, I cheated him, I forced him’

28:31.223 --> 28:33.192
all this they tell Me.

28:33.217 --> 28:35.062
Earlier i could not see

28:35.087 --> 28:39.843
but now it seems that my spirit is like a mirror in front of me.

28:39.900 --> 28:42.356
And i can understand my mistakes

28:42.381 --> 28:45.994
and i think why was i so bad?

28:46.019 --> 28:49.497
Then I told him, Whatever has happened, is over now.

28:49.522 --> 28:52.056
Now the past doesn't exist. It is over. Give it up.

28:52.081 --> 28:54.216
Now you be in the present.

28:54.241 --> 28:56.127
That has all got cleansed.

28:56.152 --> 29:03.860
And just as a lotus comes out of dirty water, fragrant

29:03.885 --> 29:07.768
filling the whole environment with fragrance

29:07.793 --> 29:11.973
now you have become like that, forget it.

29:11.998 --> 29:16.240
Because, whatever is the past, forget that.

29:16.265 --> 29:17.886
But he forgets.

29:17.911 --> 29:22.351
Later, when he progresses, he forgets.

29:22.376 --> 29:26.473
I was in Russia and there was a coup.

29:26.498 --> 29:29.096
There was a coup and I asked Sahajyogis

29:29.121 --> 29:33.152
Hey! Are you not nervous? there has been a coup in your country.

29:33.177 --> 29:34.737
God knows who will take over here and what will happen?

29:34.762 --> 29:40.779
They said,"Mother we are sitting in the kingdom of God!

29:40.804 --> 29:43.183
Why should we be afraid of?"

29:43.208 --> 29:44.827
They said very clearly

29:44.852 --> 29:48.450
"we are sitting in the kingdom of God."

29:48.475 --> 29:50.302
It is a state.

29:50.327 --> 29:52.787
It doesn't happen by talking nonsense.

29:52.812 --> 29:57.739
People will talk great things, ‘will do this,  will do that’, not like that.

29:57.764 --> 30:03.463
The greatest quality a man develops when he looks at himself fearlessly.

30:03.487 --> 30:05.439
He is not afraid of anything.

30:05.464 --> 30:08.698
He doesn't think, 'How shall i think who am i?'

30:08.723 --> 30:10.798
Because he has detatched from himself.

30:10.823 --> 30:18.117
The old self is gone and the new one has emerged.

30:18.142 --> 30:18.996
And this new life, which has emerged in the forefront

30:19.021 --> 30:24.380
is extremely beautiful and glorious.

30:24.405 --> 30:26.874
Has self respect.

30:26.899 --> 30:31.767
Is self-respecting. It is not that he becomes master of all, not that.

30:31.792 --> 30:34.166
There is SWABHIMAAN (self respect) in that.

30:34.191 --> 30:38.462
And in that  SWABHIMAAN, that which is SWA (self) is ATMA (spirit).

30:38.487 --> 30:42.669
To know this system of 'SWA' is Sahajyoga.

30:42.694 --> 30:48.317
He who knows this system of 'SWA' becomes independent.

30:48.342 --> 30:54.932
The system of 'SWA' means to know the system of one's own 'Spirit'

30:54.957 --> 31:04.471
Till now, we were glued to our intelligence or our rituals.

31:04.496 --> 31:08.801
Now our Spirit has awakened within us

31:08.826 --> 31:12.724
and in that awakening we see ourselves clearly.

31:12.749 --> 31:17.847
First, we see ourselves  then we look at our society.

31:17.872 --> 31:21.523
Now we have many people from several religions.

31:21.548 --> 31:28.728
Muslims, Hindus, Christians, Buddhists, and followers of Mahavir.

31:28.753 --> 31:31.583
People of all types have joined Sahajyoga.

31:31.608 --> 31:38.269
And first of all, I noticed that they told Me about their societies.

31:38.294 --> 31:39.822
For example, when a Jaini comes

31:39.847 --> 31:42.842
he says, "Mother please set right the brain of Jainis".

31:42.867 --> 31:46.981
If a sikh comes he says,"Mother, please set right the brains of Sikhs".

31:47.006 --> 31:51.038
If some Christian comes, he says, "Mother when will you set right Christians"?

31:51.063 --> 31:53.766
I have seen this in everyone

31:53.791 --> 31:57.681
that immediately, they distance themselves from their own self to their societies.

31:57.706 --> 32:01.980
look at the people of their household, their society

32:02.005 --> 32:07.796
then at the country and then, to the whole world.

32:07.821 --> 32:10.742
Then they start looking to all the global problems.

32:10.767 --> 32:15.586
They get confused," See Mother, this is the problem.

32:15.611 --> 32:18.386
Now this thing is happening there. You will have to do something".

32:18.411 --> 32:21.707
I told them why are you bothering me of the problems of the whole world?

32:21.732 --> 32:24.925
‘Only You can do this, You have to solve it.

32:24.950 --> 32:27.196
This man is not right, fix him’.

32:27.221 --> 32:29.043
In this way, they have got confused.

32:29.067 --> 32:34.922
They get involved in issues which concern the whole world.

32:34.947 --> 32:40.298
Just tell! An ordinary person, a farmer

32:40.323 --> 32:43.139
if he talks only about his farming, one can understand

32:43.164 --> 32:46.260
But also he started looking around and said

32:46.285 --> 32:51.489
"These people killed Rabin (Israeli Prime Minister). Why did they kill him?"

32:51.514 --> 32:54.415
Mother, you do something for their peace.

32:54.440 --> 32:56.978
Please, fix their peace.

32:57.003 --> 33:01.753
I was surprised and asked,"where did you read about it?"

33:01.778 --> 33:02.838
Was it in the newspaper?

33:02.863 --> 33:07.838
"They killed a messenger of peace", he said, With tears in his eyes.

33:07.863 --> 33:12.177
He had never seen him, nor known him.

33:12.202 --> 33:14.804
He must have read in a newspaper.

33:14.829 --> 33:22.401
How he identifies himself with the whole world?

33:22.426 --> 33:27.525
The Spirit of the world is ‘vishwatma’ (world spirit) and he becomes one with it.

33:27.550 --> 33:35.737
And the spirit becomes despaired, he can feel it inside him.

33:35.762 --> 33:40.379
He does not bother about small issues and difficulties.

33:40.404 --> 33:44.035
He doesn't think that he has got this problem, that problem.

33:44.060 --> 33:45.427
He doesn' think at all.

33:45.452 --> 33:50.614
He thinks how will the problems of the world be solved?

33:50.639 --> 33:54.072
Then this person got energy.

33:54.097 --> 33:56.342
And that too, God's energy.

33:56.367 --> 33:59.181
As soon as he started thinking this

33:59.206 --> 34:01.797
his questions also started getting solved.

34:01.822 --> 34:07.072
Because of his vastness, those questions also get solved on their own.

34:07.097 --> 34:09.092
I have seen many people who say

34:09.117 --> 34:11.898
'See Mother, it so happened once'

34:11.923 --> 34:15.540
there was a great question

34:15.565 --> 34:19.133
that in such and such a country , a war broke out.

34:19.158 --> 34:24.777
So, we thought to pray, to meditate, or do something and make a desire.

34:24.802 --> 34:28.386
Next day, it was published in the newspaper that peace had settled in.

34:28.489 --> 34:33.504
Nobody will believe, if it is said that someone can do such a thing.

34:33.529 --> 34:37.138
But, why doesn't a man believe?

34:37.163 --> 34:42.199
Because, a man knows his vastness, his greatness.

34:42.224 --> 34:45.126
Till he doesn't recognize himself

34:45.151 --> 34:48.269
how can he recognize his greatness?

34:48.294 --> 34:51.516
How will he know what is his worth?

34:51.541 --> 34:56.515
What is his dignity and what are his powers?

34:56.540 --> 35:01.306
You can get all this only after knowing your own self.

35:01.893 --> 35:05.540
You know about Kundalini?

35:05.565 --> 35:08.594
You also know about the chakras.

35:08.619 --> 35:12.307
And what happens with the opening of chakras, it is their manifestation.

35:12.332 --> 35:15.165
If we say only this

35:15.190 --> 35:17.871
that this health problem improves, that health problem improves

35:17.896 --> 35:22.477
then people will say have you opened a hospital?

35:22.502 --> 35:29.647
Only to improve one's health is not the work of Sahajyoga now.

35:29.672 --> 35:31.285
That time is over now.

35:31.310 --> 35:38.558
Father's grand father's, grand father's, father's own son

35:38.583 --> 35:42.181
Mother, please set him right.

35:42.206 --> 35:43.630
Such and such a person is drinking

35:43.655 --> 35:46.947
such and such a person is doing this, such and such a person is doing that.

35:46.972 --> 35:50.399
Earlier it used to be like that only. Now it is not so.

35:50.423 --> 35:55.433
Now I am surprised, how much broad minded  man is becoming in this  country.

35:55.458 --> 35:57.703
You have to achieve this broad mindedness.

35:57.728 --> 36:02.553
Now you yourself think, at one time in this country, such people were there

36:02.578 --> 36:06.231
such contemplating people, such visionaries

36:06.256 --> 36:09.727
who concerned themselves about world issues.

36:09.752 --> 36:14.732
They do not run after small, petty issues.

36:14.757 --> 36:20.933
Now you must listen to and see their explanations visit them.

36:20.958 --> 36:23.788
In this country itself, we had such great people

36:23.813 --> 36:28.072
who always thought of great things, did great things.

36:28.097 --> 36:31.850
I do not know in which pit we have got trapped?

36:31.875 --> 36:37.050
that we think of such greatness, not possible at all.

36:37.075 --> 36:40.035
How can we be like that?  Why not?

36:40.060 --> 36:46.169
There were people who at one time  could fight the British.

36:46.194 --> 36:49.012
They sacrificed so much for the country.

36:49.037 --> 36:53.805
Can’t they return back to our country?

36:53.830 --> 36:55.478
In which other country will they go?

36:55.503 --> 36:57.334
Those who loved this country so much

36:57.359 --> 37:01.681
can’t they take birth in this country again?

37:01.706 --> 37:04.642
Those who have sacrificed so much for the country

37:04.667 --> 37:06.606
faced so many problems for the country.

37:06.631 --> 37:11.045
Today they will again get awakened through Sahaja Yoga.

37:11.070 --> 37:14.788
I am fully hopeful that those who will love their country

37:14.813 --> 37:16.939
and reinstate order in the country

37:16.964 --> 37:19.998
bring peace, serenity and everything to this country.

37:20.023 --> 37:22.956
After that when this country will get corrected

37:22.981 --> 37:24.815
then more countries will follow suit.

37:24.840 --> 37:28.682
We have already world issues before us.

37:28.707 --> 37:33.814
But we have to see which country will lead?

37:33.839 --> 37:37.055
Which country will be the flag bearer?

37:37.080 --> 37:43.894
Which country's people say that we will show it by making such an ideal country

37:43.919 --> 37:49.866
Where people will be at a high spiritual level?

37:49.891 --> 37:53.460
In Sahaja Yoga, ‘spiritual’ does not mean

37:53.485 --> 37:58.109
deserting the wife and children and run to the jungles. Not at all.

37:58.134 --> 38:03.104
We should introspect and achieve that higher state

38:03.129 --> 38:11.870
the special state which is made for us and which we can achieve.

38:11.926 --> 38:14.257
There is no difficulty.

38:14.282 --> 38:26.108
Nothing is to be sacrificed but of stupidity and foolishness

38:26.133 --> 38:31.138
your narrow mindedness, which makes you have selfish temperament

38:31.163 --> 38:32.508
you should run away from that.

38:32.533 --> 38:37.040
You should understand that this is the narrow mindedness within me.

38:38.731 --> 38:43.572
After that, you will see that all your doubts will be clear.

38:43.597 --> 38:46.190
You believe in God.

38:46.215 --> 38:51.374
Do you think that going to a temple or gurdwara and paying obeisance will help?

38:51.399 --> 38:53.085
It will not help.

38:53.110 --> 38:55.877
Inside us, the belief

38:55.902 --> 38:58.013
whatever beliefs you have till now

38:58.038 --> 39:02.086
that dharma should be a part and parcel of our inner self

39:02.111 --> 39:04.638
the greatness of this religion is such

39:04.663 --> 39:09.302
that it has made a large number of great people to come to this country.

39:09.327 --> 39:12.426
I say that, in no other country there have been so many great people.

39:12.451 --> 39:15.996
The saints that have been in this country, have been no where.

39:16.021 --> 39:18.859
No where have been so many saints as we had in this country.

39:18.884 --> 39:26.468
That means that our country can make a great contribution to the world.

39:26.494 --> 39:29.231
Recently I had gone to China.

39:29.359 --> 39:30.878
I was very surprised

39:30.903 --> 39:33.832
that although Chinese may publicly have anti-India feelings

39:33.857 --> 39:41.768
they say they have a lot of expectations from India, have lots of hopes.

39:41.793 --> 39:44.750
I asked, "what expectations?".

39:44.775 --> 39:50.282
They said, ‘We know there is a minefield of spirituality.

39:50.307 --> 39:53.712
But till now nobody has told us about it’.

39:53.737 --> 39:55.227
In our Sahaj Yoga stall

39:55.252 --> 40:04.918
there were long queues where people came to ask 'what Sahaja Yoga was?'

40:04.943 --> 40:06.645
It was published in newspapers.

40:06.670 --> 40:09.759
Americans were wondering what was there in it?

40:09.784 --> 40:11.879
Why were so many people gathering there?

40:11.904 --> 40:14.507
Then, you are seeing so many people sitting in front of you

40:14.532 --> 40:16.088
from foreign countries too

40:16.113 --> 40:23.478
those, who after getting Sahajyoga are Singing the saga of your India's pride.

40:23.503 --> 40:27.255
you should also take a look at this.

40:27.280 --> 40:31.877
In Sahaja Yoga, you will have no problem in getting your realisation because you are ready.

40:31.902 --> 40:38.054
Like a seed, you put it into the mother earth, it will flourish

40:38.079 --> 40:41.978
because seed also has energy and mother too has energy.

40:42.003 --> 40:49.045
But later to grow into a tree it takes time. That  is necessary.

40:49.070 --> 40:53.670
Because your vasteness will be visible, when you will become just like a tree.

40:53.695 --> 40:58.253
For that, you have to get into meditation.

40:58.278 --> 41:01.535
You cannot do Sahaja Yoga with shallowness.

41:01.560 --> 41:07.602
You will enjoy it only when you dive in spirituality.

41:07.627 --> 41:13.139
You get deep into it and then only you will enjoy Sahaja Yoga.

41:13.164 --> 41:20.099
And then you will know what you are and how vast you are.

41:20.124 --> 41:31.044
In spite of everything, such peace and solution will reside inside

41:31.069 --> 41:37.767
that through this power alone, with your attention you can set things right.

41:37.792 --> 41:42.936
I can tell you that your attention will become so beautiful

41:42.961 --> 41:52.610
that wherever it goes, you can fix many things.

41:52.635 --> 41:59.606
So, if you have to bring yourself out of selfish mode

41:59.631 --> 42:06.229
if you want to come to a more higher state, you have to meditate without fail.

42:06.277 --> 42:11.323
Only through meditation, everything works out.

42:11.348 --> 42:15.730
Now, it is so, that people told me

42:15.755 --> 42:19.595
that men do a lot of meditation and women do less.

42:19.620 --> 42:25.462
It is surprising because I am a woman.

42:25.487 --> 42:29.149
I also have a home, I have children, everything is there.

42:29.197 --> 42:32.908
Whilst managing everything, through meditation

42:32.933 --> 42:39.342
I have worked out a system, where thousands can be given realisation.

42:39.366 --> 42:44.357
So, I humbly ask that if ladies meditate, children will also meditate.

42:44.382 --> 42:46.570
A woman is the concentration of energy.

42:46.595 --> 42:53.415
Where ladies will not meditate, there children also will not meditate.

42:53.440 --> 42:55.430
Meditation is necessary to manage children.

42:55.455 --> 43:02.302
The husband does it anyway because he runs the home, and the lady protects.

43:02.327 --> 43:05.703
So, if the husband meditates

43:05.728 --> 43:09.616
the lady also meditates, children should also meditate.

43:09.641 --> 43:15.984
The most important thing about Sahaja Yoga is that it is collective.

43:16.009 --> 43:21.284
That ‘I do pooja at home Mother, still I fell sick’.

43:21.309 --> 43:25.705
Not alone. When you come into the collective

43:25.730 --> 43:30.335
when you believe in Sahaja Yoga collectivity

43:30.360 --> 43:34.160
then it is the present-day Sahaja Yoga.

43:34.232 --> 43:38.781
Those days are gone when one individual somewhere used to get realisation.

43:38.806 --> 43:42.822
Thousands, lacs and crores of people have to get their realisation.

43:42.847 --> 43:45.215
So, we have to become collective

43:45.240 --> 43:48.398
and the power of collective is tremendous.

43:48.423 --> 43:58.438
I am happy that Delhi has taken so well to Sahaja Yoga and understood it.

43:58.463 --> 44:04.674
People are so sensitive in Delhi.

44:04.699 --> 44:08.810
It is very surprising that in Maharashtra

44:08.835 --> 44:12.516
where so many sages and saints have not so much wisdom as you have.

44:12.541 --> 44:13.996
I am so surprised to see that.

44:14.021 --> 44:17.393
They think that they know everything. They have understood everything.

44:17.418 --> 44:19.773
There were nine ‘Naths’ (great saints from the Nath ideology) there but in vain.

44:19.798 --> 44:22.328
There were so many sages and saints there but in vain.

44:22.353 --> 44:27.734
The way you have explained and developed

44:27.759 --> 44:33.897
to spread this, you have to do individual meditation

44:33.922 --> 44:36.986
and participate in collective meditation.

44:37.011 --> 44:40.609
I agree that we have a shortage of space

44:40.634 --> 44:42.823
and we have to do something about it.

44:42.848 --> 44:44.916
Slowly and slowly everything will fall in place.

44:44.941 --> 44:48.396
But wherever you become collective

44:48.421 --> 44:50.741
then you will not talk about anything else.

44:50.766 --> 44:54.686
You will only talk about Sahaja Yoga.

44:54.711 --> 44:59.823
This is only the beginning and after this

44:59.848 --> 45:02.825
we will have our programmes everywhere.

45:02.850 --> 45:06.158
Those who can come, please do come!
