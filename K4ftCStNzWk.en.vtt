00:00:11.418 --> 00:00:16.218
It’s my privilege and pleasure to introduce

00:00:16.418 --> 00:00:21.738
the first of our distinguished guest-speakers.

00:00:22.618 --> 00:00:25.578
He bears a famous name

00:00:26.338 --> 00:00:29.338
and needs very little in the way of introduction.

00:00:30.458 --> 00:00:36.458
Alfred Nobel, the Swedish chemist and industrialist

00:00:36.458 --> 00:00:40.458
of course, he was the man who invented dynamites

00:00:40.698 --> 00:00:47.738
and left his fortune to be used for the Nobel Prize

00:00:48.538 --> 00:00:50.658
himself was a bachelor,

00:00:50.898 --> 00:00:56.698
but Mr. Claes Nobel is his grandnephew.

00:00:57.778 --> 00:01:05.178
He was inspired by the work of his distinguished forebear

00:01:06.058 --> 00:01:14.058
and has himself had the inspiration to found an organization

00:01:14.698 --> 00:01:18.618
which is called “United Earth”, which he is still the chairman.

00:01:18.778 --> 00:01:22.738
And this organization has itself instituted a prize

00:01:22.778 --> 00:01:25.938
in the ecological sphere

00:01:26.018 --> 00:01:31.778
which is not one of the Nobel Prizes, there is no prize for ecology.

00:01:32.338 --> 00:01:36.578
And this prize he calls “Earth Ethics”.

00:01:36.778 --> 00:01:39.098
He met Shri Mataji last year in India

00:01:39.138 --> 00:01:44.458
when he was the chairman of the World Philosophers conference.

00:01:44.898 --> 00:01:47.138
So without any more ado, I’dd like to

00:01:47.178 --> 00:01:50.858
invite Mr. Claes Nobel to come on to the stage, please.

00:02:02.898 --> 00:02:08.978
Well, indeed, life is full of surprises,

00:02:09.378 --> 00:02:15.698
after all we are meeting here inspired by the message and work

00:02:16.098 --> 00:02:20.938
by Holy Mother Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi

00:02:21.338 --> 00:02:29.058
and She is not here in body, but She is here in Spirits.

00:02:29.338 --> 00:02:32.298
Also the wonderful letter that we recently heard

00:02:32.338 --> 00:02:35.138
from ayatollah Ruhani

00:02:35.258 --> 00:02:39.138
which speaks very highly about the work and the mission

00:02:39.178 --> 00:02:41.538
of the Holy Mother,

00:02:41.658 --> 00:02:46.418
where he indicates the importance of women

00:02:46.458 --> 00:02:50.258
in the world is needed here.

00:02:50.618 --> 00:02:55.258
And frankly speaking, only 36 hours ago

00:02:55.298 --> 00:02:57.858
I did not know that I would be here

00:02:57.978 --> 00:03:01.218
tonight at the Royal Albert Hall,

00:03:01.298 --> 00:03:04.778
addressing this audience.

00:03:04.938 --> 00:03:12.938
Still I say: Dear Holy Mother,

00:03:13.578 --> 00:03:20.978
and I also recognize her husband Sir C.P. Srivastava in the audience,

00:03:21.178 --> 00:03:27.698
and I say, most importantly: dear friends, fellow-seekers of truth,

00:03:27.898 --> 00:03:31.058
Are you out there? Because with all this light,

00:03:31.218 --> 00:03:34.978
I can only see about 20 people in front of me.

00:03:35.098 --> 00:03:38.178
So, say “yes”, if you are in here, then I know…

00:03:39.498 --> 00:03:40.578
Ah…

00:03:47.418 --> 00:03:52.698
Now I can see you, I can here you as well as you can see and here me.

00:03:52.778 --> 00:03:58.058
With that said, I want to say I have a vision,

00:03:58.298 --> 00:04:03.938
I have a vision for a world that is better, safer and saner

00:04:04.058 --> 00:04:07.458
than the one that we presently are experiencing.

00:04:07.658 --> 00:04:13.218
It is a world where people live in harmony and peace with themselves

00:04:13.338 --> 00:04:16.858
and in harmony and peace with Nature.

00:04:17.018 --> 00:04:22.338
Now, those words of vast, it’s a bold vision,

00:04:22.618 --> 00:04:28.458
do I have a practical way of going from vision to reality?

00:04:29.298 --> 00:04:34.138
Yes, I will share that with you.

00:04:34.338 --> 00:04:38.418
And I will share it and indicate a tone of the meeting

00:04:38.458 --> 00:04:42.298
by ten small words.

00:04:43.458 --> 00:04:47.538
And they indicate how this global world transformation

00:04:47.618 --> 00:04:49.978
should be undertaken.

00:04:50.138 --> 00:05:01.178
And they are: Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Deeds,

00:05:01.378 --> 00:05:06.418
Right Here and Right Now.

00:05:07.538 --> 00:05:16.818
The key word, the key word is, of course, “right”,

00:05:17.138 --> 00:05:20.098
this world is fighting about what is right,

00:05:20.218 --> 00:05:24.178
what is right to you might be wrong to me or vice-versa,

00:05:24.218 --> 00:05:26.058
it’s a grey area.

00:05:26.178 --> 00:05:29.098
So we need a reference point,

00:05:29.218 --> 00:05:33.578
so we can distinguish between right and wrong

00:05:33.698 --> 00:05:37.418
and between truth and lie.

00:05:37.698 --> 00:05:37.858
Tonight Shri Mataji will show us what is right.

00:05:46.618 --> 00:05:50.658
Tonight Shri Mataji will empower us

00:05:50.698 --> 00:05:55.498
to become the masters of our own destiny.

00:05:55.698 --> 00:05:59.538
And tonight we’ll be guided

00:05:59.578 --> 00:06:04.778
by the knowledge of Self Realization.

00:06:05.018 --> 00:06:09.898
We will do so in the light of Truth

00:06:10.258 --> 00:06:17.538
and we shall all know absolute truth and absolute peace.

00:06:17.698 --> 00:06:23.658
Now, 100 years ago Alfred Nobel established the Nobel Prizes.

00:06:23.778 --> 00:06:27.138
These prizes represent excellence.

00:06:27.298 --> 00:06:32.698
We have prizes in chemistry, physics, medicine, literature

00:06:32.738 --> 00:06:35.178
and peace.

00:06:35.258 --> 00:06:42.778
All those prizes, I hold the peace prize to be the finest.

00:06:43.458 --> 00:06:49.938
And I want to tell you that Alfred Nobel listened to a woman,

00:06:49.938 --> 00:06:53.698
he listened to his secretary Bertha von Suttner in Paris

00:06:53.698 --> 00:06:55.778
100 years ago when she said:

00:06:55.778 --> 00:07:00.458
”Dr. Nobel, you should use your vast fortune

00:07:00.498 --> 00:07:03.898
for betterment of the world”.

00:07:04.178 --> 00:07:08.458
Tonight we are listening to another woman,

00:07:08.458 --> 00:07:13.698
we are listening to the message of Shri Mataji.

00:07:14.058 --> 00:07:19.018
However, I am very much inspired first by my uncle

00:07:19.218 --> 00:07:22.978
and later on, you will hear, by Shri Mataji.

00:07:23.258 --> 00:07:27.138
Alfred Nobel talked much about peace.

00:07:27.378 --> 00:07:31.938
He was frightened that his awesome explosive dynamite

00:07:31.938 --> 00:07:36.218
which cleared up land for harbors and tunnels

00:07:36.458 --> 00:07:39.458
could also be used for war affair.

00:07:39.618 --> 00:07:44.538
Today, in the arsenal of military systems,

00:07:44.538 --> 00:07:46.778
it’s like a small fire cracker,

00:07:46.778 --> 00:07:52.578
but at that time dynamite was a most awesome destructive material.

00:07:52.778 --> 00:07:55.778
Now, Alfred Nobel thought basically

00:07:55.898 --> 00:08:00.538
about peace as absence of war.

00:08:00.938 --> 00:08:07.298
But I assure you that peace is much more than absence of war.

00:08:07.698 --> 00:08:13.218
And I see that peace exists in four specific areas.

00:08:13.458 --> 00:08:19.178
The first area is the peace that an individual has in him or herself

00:08:19.378 --> 00:08:24.538
how do we treat our mind, our emotions and our feelings?

00:08:24.698 --> 00:08:28.098
How do we treat our body?

00:08:28.258 --> 00:08:33.178
Are we slaves to other masters

00:08:33.258 --> 00:08:35.658
or are we our own master?

00:08:35.778 --> 00:08:40.458
Until we have the inner peace in ourselves,

00:08:40.498 --> 00:08:44.138
we can never have an outer peace in the world.

00:08:44.218 --> 00:08:48.378
And the safest and best way of finding world peace

00:08:48.418 --> 00:08:54.218
is to have mass movements that include all religions and philosophies,

00:08:54.378 --> 00:09:00.618
all enterprises, whether they are of political or scientific nature,

00:09:00.698 --> 00:09:04.338
to realize what inner peace is.

00:09:04.418 --> 00:09:08.698
And that’s what we are talking about tonight: Self Realization.

00:09:09.018 --> 00:09:11.058
What does Self Realization mean?

00:09:11.178 --> 00:09:16.538
Well, it means that we are realizing something, but what is the Self?

00:09:16.698 --> 00:09:23.098
Ladies and gentlemen, the Self in us is the Divine Cosmic Power

00:09:23.098 --> 00:09:26.218
that exist in each and every individual,

00:09:26.218 --> 00:09:32.418
but which is dormant in most people around the world.

00:09:32.578 --> 00:09:36.018
The spiritual leaders from ancient lores,

00:09:36.058 --> 00:09:39.218
they knew about this and they spoke about this.

00:09:39.218 --> 00:09:45.298
But this secret of secrets has been suppressed deliberately

00:09:45.418 --> 00:09:50.978
until Shri Mataji with great courage and great wisdom,

00:09:51.138 --> 00:09:54.698
being an old soul would decided by Herself

00:09:54.738 --> 00:09:58.298
to come back to the Earth at this critical time in our history,

00:09:58.298 --> 00:10:01.898
in order to share Her knowledge and wisdom

00:10:01.938 --> 00:10:04.498
which is the Sahaja Yoga,

00:10:04.578 --> 00:10:07.578
which is instant Self Realization,

00:10:07.658 --> 00:10:10.978
which is to activate the dormant principle

00:10:11.018 --> 00:10:12.938
that we all have: the Kundalini,

00:10:12.978 --> 00:10:18.978
and have the Kundalini to rise up and thus we become

00:10:19.218 --> 00:10:25.978
what it says in the Bible: “You are created in My image”.

00:10:33.258 --> 00:10:36.978
That was the first category, first sphere of peace

00:10:37.058 --> 00:10:39.058
the one we have in ourselves.

00:10:39.138 --> 00:10:45.698
The next one is the peace that we have among each other

00:10:45.858 --> 00:10:51.058
in the family, in our community, in our nation,

00:10:51.258 --> 00:10:54.098
that we have peace with other ethnic groups

00:10:54.138 --> 00:10:56.378
and with other religions,

00:10:56.498 --> 00:11:03.138
that we really become true what I call “active listeners”

00:11:03.378 --> 00:11:07.098
And, as “active listeners” are able to put ourselves

00:11:07.138 --> 00:11:14.098
in the place, in the shoes of the other party.

00:11:14.218 --> 00:11:18.658
Only then, when we have the outlook from their perspective,

00:11:18.738 --> 00:11:22.218
shall we understand what they are trying to say.

00:11:22.338 --> 00:11:24.978
We are always talking, talking, talking.

00:11:25.138 --> 00:11:28.218
My dear wife, who is not here tonight,

00:11:28.298 --> 00:11:32.938
she said: ”Claes, you talk too much, you don’t listen”.

00:11:33.218 --> 00:11:38.658
I have start to practice what she calls “active listening”.

00:11:39.338 --> 00:11:43.218
The third sphere is a sphere that put me in, originally.

00:11:43.218 --> 00:11:46.498
After all, I am a European Swedish business man,

00:11:46.498 --> 00:11:50.618
why am I up here speaking the language of spirituality

00:11:50.658 --> 00:11:55.098
and saying that that is where the hope of the future exists?

00:11:55.298 --> 00:11:59.338
I am doing so, because I have a deep and profound

00:11:59.378 --> 00:12:01.458
reverence for Nature,

00:12:01.538 --> 00:12:06.098
as a Nobel Peace laureate Dr. Albert Schweitzer said.

00:12:06.258 --> 00:12:09.418
After, he add, worked and worked, trying to

00:12:09.538 --> 00:12:13.338
distil the phrase that contained everything that he knew,

00:12:13.338 --> 00:12:16.258
everything he wanted to say through his philosophy,

00:12:16.338 --> 00:12:22.258
Dr. Albert Schweitzer calling the phrase “reverence for Life”

00:12:22.458 --> 00:12:25.618
Nature is nothing but a plethora

00:12:25.698 --> 00:12:29.778
of examples of life in its multifaceted version.

00:12:29.978 --> 00:12:34.298
And I tell you, dear fellows seekers of Truth,

00:12:34.418 --> 00:12:38.458
we, humanity today, in our ignorance,

00:12:38.578 --> 00:12:41.738
in our greed and in our lust for power,

00:12:41.898 --> 00:12:44.098
we are in the process of destroying the

00:12:44.298 --> 00:12:46.778
very thing that makes this planet unique

00:12:46.858 --> 00:12:51.338
and that is Life on Earth.

00:12:58.098 --> 00:13:04.418
And, so far, we do not know of another planet in the universe

00:13:04.458 --> 00:13:07.258
that harbors this miracle.

00:13:07.338 --> 00:13:14.698
Earth is like a blue jewel in space

00:13:14.698 --> 00:13:18.378
and is only one Earth and this Earth is fragile

00:13:18.458 --> 00:13:21.218
and we must take care of her and respect her.

00:13:21.218 --> 00:13:23.658
Earth is also called Nature.

00:13:23.658 --> 00:13:27.938
We cannot break the laws of Nature,

00:13:28.218 --> 00:13:31.618
we must live by the laws of Nature.

00:13:31.698 --> 00:13:34.658
If we break them, Mother Earth will break us.

00:13:34.898 --> 00:13:37.858
And we are only one species of –

00:13:37.938 --> 00:13:43.138
we don’t know how many species we have – 5, 10, 15 millions.

00:13:43.338 --> 00:13:45.258
But this we know

00:13:45.298 --> 00:13:49.018
and this is being proven by the world foremost scientist

00:13:49.218 --> 00:13:55.618
in Harvard University U.S., Dr. Edward O. Wilson:

00:13:55.698 --> 00:14:03.058
we are today bringing to extinction 250 species per day.

00:14:03.218 --> 00:14:06.938
That is as if we are deliberately and willfully

00:14:07.018 --> 00:14:09.698
pulling out thread after thread after thread

00:14:09.778 --> 00:14:12.458
of what consists the fabric of life

00:14:12.538 --> 00:14:15.858
and Mother Nature will not let us continue doing that

00:14:15.938 --> 00:14:20.698
without correcting us as naughty children.

00:14:21.058 --> 00:14:27.378
The fourth sphere of peace is the peace that we shall know

00:14:27.498 --> 00:14:31.018
between ourselves and God.

00:14:31.378 --> 00:14:34.178
Any religion or any group

00:14:34.218 --> 00:14:38.018
who raises their arms and destroys its enemy

00:14:38.018 --> 00:14:44.138
in the name of God is not following what God has asked us to do.

00:14:44.138 --> 00:14:47.778
The world should not know of violence

00:14:53.938 --> 00:14:56.778
and the world should not know of war.

00:14:57.658 --> 00:15:02.618
I call, as you earlier heard, these four spheres of peace

00:15:02.698 --> 00:15:05.698
“Earth Ethics”

00:15:05.778 --> 00:15:09.538
And tonight we will hear more from the Holy Mother

00:15:09.658 --> 00:15:13.978
how we shall have a reference point, how we can distinguish

00:15:14.058 --> 00:15:16.738
if we have a charlatan and a fraud in front of us,

00:15:16.778 --> 00:15:20.938
or if it’s a genuine honest person.

00:15:21.978 --> 00:15:26.258
And you, dear audience, you have come here tonight

00:15:26.338 --> 00:15:29.178
from many different walks of life.

00:15:29.338 --> 00:15:36.018
And like you, I have also been seeking for the truth.

00:15:36.138 --> 00:15:42.098
I am beginning to discern truth rather clearly

00:15:42.418 --> 00:15:47.938
and let me tell you this, that I look upon life on Earth

00:15:48.058 --> 00:15:52.178
as a kind of a school, a school

00:15:52.218 --> 00:15:57.338
where we are learning perfection and purification.

00:15:57.778 --> 00:16:01.658
Now on Earth everything is interdependent,

00:16:01.698 --> 00:16:05.018
interactive and interrelated.

00:16:05.258 --> 00:16:08.258
And on Earth, as well as in Heaven, I guess

00:16:08.298 --> 00:16:10.618
every action has a reaction,

00:16:10.698 --> 00:16:15.538
every effect has a cause, every cause has an effect.

00:16:15.898 --> 00:16:21.138
And the Holy Mother, as I said, She is a highly evolved soul,

00:16:21.218 --> 00:16:25.058
She has learned from many many lives

00:16:25.098 --> 00:16:27.498
what it is all about

00:16:27.618 --> 00:16:31.578
and these what it is all about laws, the unseen laws,

00:16:31.618 --> 00:16:33.378
the spiritual laws,

00:16:33.418 --> 00:16:38.218
they’re always here and they work as infallible

00:16:38.258 --> 00:16:41.418
as the law of gravity works.

00:16:41.658 --> 00:16:45.178
It always works, all those unseen laws.

00:16:45.378 --> 00:16:51.098
It is for us to learn and perceive that law.

00:16:52.378 --> 00:17:00.058
I am very comfortable with the teachings of Shri Mataji

00:17:00.218 --> 00:17:05.498
and I am very comfortable with the Holy Mother Herself.

00:17:05.618 --> 00:17:11.698
I say so because in the Bible there is one saying

00:17:11.698 --> 00:17:18.338
among several good ones: “You shall know the tree by its fruit”.

00:17:18.458 --> 00:17:22.738
And lately, I have met young men and women

00:17:22.738 --> 00:17:25.218
in different parts of the world,

00:17:25.298 --> 00:17:28.418
and certainly from many different parts of the world

00:17:28.538 --> 00:17:34.578
and they are all shining, beautiful human individuals

00:17:34.698 --> 00:17:39.578
that radiate inner peace and balance.

00:17:39.778 --> 00:17:41.458
They are unique.

00:17:41.538 --> 00:17:45.298
You who follow or who are in a process of following

00:17:45.778 --> 00:17:48.938
will be, I think,

00:17:49.018 --> 00:17:52.058
those individuals who shall call themselves

00:17:52.098 --> 00:17:55.858
“ambassadors for the Earth”.

00:17:56.258 --> 00:17:59.378
And after tonight session is over,

00:17:59.578 --> 00:18:04.258
I’m sure that you shall see clearly

00:18:04.298 --> 00:18:07.698
how you shall distinguish between truth and lie

00:18:07.978 --> 00:18:12.298
and you shall realize that blind faith

00:18:12.378 --> 00:18:19.378
is of no value and that fanaticism and

00:18:22.218 --> 00:18:27.098
to take up violence as a last argument is of no value:

00:18:27.138 --> 00:18:30.978
eventually those things will bring you unhappiness

00:18:31.018 --> 00:18:37.138
and will bring you conflict and potential war.

00:18:39.498 --> 00:18:47.298
Ladies and gentlemen, I know that we hold the future in our hands.

00:18:47.418 --> 00:18:50.858
I know that the future is in your hands

00:18:50.938 --> 00:18:53.658
I know it’s in my hands.

00:18:53.698 --> 00:18:58.178
And I also know that the future of the planet

00:18:58.218 --> 00:19:03.498
exists in the heart of the individuals.

00:19:03.698 --> 00:19:10.698
Now, I will close my remarks tonight by a fable from India.

00:19:10.978 --> 00:19:16.218
I heard it when I attended the Rio Conference ’92,

00:19:16.378 --> 00:19:19.938
that was the 20-th anniversary of the Stockholm Conference,

00:19:20.018 --> 00:19:25.378
that for the first time put on the environment on the world agenda.

00:19:25.538 --> 00:19:29.538
In Stockholm ’72 we had only two heads of states:

00:19:29.618 --> 00:19:32.458
the prime minister of India and the king of Sweden.

00:19:32.458 --> 00:19:37.698
In Rio, 20 years later, we had 110 heads of states.

00:19:38.018 --> 00:19:42.298
A marvelous declaration was drafted, “Agenda 21”.

00:19:42.418 --> 00:19:46.058
Just last week in New York there were 70 heads of state

00:19:46.258 --> 00:19:49.058
that continued with “Rio plus 5”.

00:19:49.218 --> 00:19:51.538
What is I told Sir C.P. when he asked me

00:19:51.538 --> 00:19:54.218
about how is the outcome of this conference,

00:19:54.218 --> 00:19:58.218
I said: Well, we are talking about sustainable future,

00:19:58.218 --> 00:20:01.258
for it seems to me that in UN there is much

00:20:01.258 --> 00:20:04.338
of a sustainable dialogue ongoing.

00:20:04.418 --> 00:20:06.578
Tonight we should take the action.

00:20:06.578 --> 00:20:12.458
Well, I asked the holy man from India, a white robed Acharya

00:20:12.498 --> 00:20:14.618
and I said:

00:20:15.218 --> 00:20:19.378
“Is there hope for the future?”.

00:20:19.538 --> 00:20:26.418
And he said: “Mr. Nobel, I will answer your question as follows”,

00:20:26.938 --> 00:20:32.178
and this is what he said: “When the Dear Lord had created the Earth,

00:20:32.258 --> 00:20:36.698
He was very very happy, very very very pleased,

00:20:36.738 --> 00:20:41.458
it was His finest creation in the Universe

00:20:41.538 --> 00:20:45.298
and He decided to celebrate, to have a party.

00:20:45.418 --> 00:20:51.898
And God invited in all angels and all the devils.

00:20:52.098 --> 00:20:53.898
When they were there,

00:20:53.938 --> 00:20:56.698
He toasted them and wished them welcome as a good host

00:20:56.698 --> 00:20:57.698
and said:

00:20:57.738 --> 00:21:02.218
There is only one rule that you must strictly obey while you are here

00:21:02.338 --> 00:21:05.298
having a good time. And, by the way,

00:21:05.458 --> 00:21:09.738
the best food and the best wine was served, the ambrosia and nectar.

00:21:09.898 --> 00:21:15.018
And He said: "There is one rule and that is that while you are here"

00:21:15.138 --> 00:21:22.178
celebrating My creation, you may never bend your elbows.

00:21:22.378 --> 00:21:25.258
The devils cried out and said:

00:21:25.338 --> 00:21:28.978
We don’t want any part of such party.

00:21:29.098 --> 00:21:31.938
How can we enjoy it, not bending our elbows?!

00:21:31.978 --> 00:21:34.578
So they left.

00:21:35.018 --> 00:21:37.178
Then the party started,

00:21:37.218 --> 00:21:39.738
the angels were having a jolly good time

00:21:39.858 --> 00:21:43.218
and the Dear God was very very happy.”

00:21:43.338 --> 00:21:51.338
Now, how could they eat and drink, without bending their elbows?

00:21:53.698 --> 00:22:00.738
Well, I sense that you can see what the moral of the fable is.

00:22:00.898 --> 00:22:04.098
The angels were feeding each other,

00:22:04.138 --> 00:22:08.778
they were sharing and they were caring,

00:22:08.938 --> 00:22:14.738
and that is what we shall do in the future together.

00:22:14.978 --> 00:22:16.738
Thank you very much.
