00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:26.616
Today, we are going to worship
the Mahalakshmi

00:05:26.817 --> 00:05:32.675
which I think is very much worshipped
in this country

00:05:32.876 --> 00:05:36.715
where they worship Her as Maria

00:05:36.916 --> 00:05:42.903
and also there’s a swayambhu of Maria,
you must have seen.

00:05:43.104 --> 00:05:49.522
And also there was an apparition of Her.
First I never believed that it could be,

00:05:49.723 --> 00:05:55.935
but then after feeling the vibrations,
now I know it was true,

00:05:56.136 --> 00:05:59.691
that She did appear here in an apparition.

00:05:59.892 --> 00:06:05.517
She appeared before Me, also, you must
have seen, in a photograph.

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:19.364
This is the principle by which you have
risen to this state.

00:06:19.565 --> 00:06:25.952
The central path of your ascent is created
by Mahalakshmi power

00:06:26.153 --> 00:06:29.920
for the Kundalini to rise.

00:06:30.121 --> 00:06:33.593
In the temple of Mahalakshmi in Kolhapur

00:06:33.794 --> 00:06:37.556
they always sing the song of “Ude, Ude,
Ambe.”

00:06:37.757 --> 00:06:46.295
So I asked the people there, “Why do you
sing Ambe’s song in Mahalakshmi’s temple?”

00:06:46.496 --> 00:06:53.456
So they said that, “We don’t know why
we do it, but is it wrong?”

00:06:53.657 --> 00:07:01.752
I said, “No, because only in the
Mahalakshmi channel

00:07:01.953 --> 00:07:07.632
Kundalini can rise and Kundalini is
the Amba.”

00:07:07.833 --> 00:07:11.973
That’s how, you see, they understood
and they were really amazed

00:07:12.174 --> 00:07:16.059
that I explained it very well ‘cause
from ancient times

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:23.358
this song has been sung there and they
never knew why this song is sung.

00:07:25.267 --> 00:07:33.513
Coming to the point of Mahalakshmi, we have
to understand what does it do,

00:07:33.714 --> 00:07:41.687
what it’s help is that this Mahalakshmi
channel or the Mahalakshmi’s powers

00:07:41.888 --> 00:07:54.057
have created within us a proper balance,
a proper route for Kundalini to rise.

00:07:54.258 --> 00:07:59.880
Left and right has been balanced and She
is the one who creates

00:08:00.081 --> 00:08:09.338
and makes a wider path for Kundalini
to rise.

00:08:09.544 --> 00:08:16.941
This is the path of compassion and love.

00:08:17.142 --> 00:08:21.600
Through that compassion and love
She creates this path

00:08:21.801 --> 00:08:29.665
because She knows that if the path is not
wide enough the Kundalini cannot rise.

00:08:29.866 --> 00:08:36.300
Ultimately, one reaches a state where you
start seeking

00:08:36.501 --> 00:08:41.924
and when you start seeking, your
Mahalakshmi principle has been awakened.

00:08:42.125 --> 00:08:46.767
That is awakened and sometimes it is
very strong.

00:08:46.968 --> 00:08:50.274
Then you start seeking in a mad way.

00:08:50.475 --> 00:08:54.475
I am sorry to say that many are already
lost in seeking,

00:08:54.676 --> 00:09:03.765
but there are so many who have now come
to the right path and to the right ascent.

00:09:03.966 --> 00:09:08.615
The another thing this Mahalakshmi
principle does is to allow

00:09:08.816 --> 00:09:14.345
the Kundalini’s power to go to different
chakras also,

00:09:14.546 --> 00:09:19.433
to make a way to different chakras and
corrects all the chakras.

00:09:19.634 --> 00:09:23.329
She is a very flexible force, I should say,

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:27.812
which guides the Kundalini into different
chakras

00:09:28.013 --> 00:09:33.082
and She understands which chakra needs
the help of the Kundalini.

00:09:33.283 --> 00:09:38.008
So you must have seen that when
the Kundalini rises how She pulsates,

00:09:38.209 --> 00:09:45.286
where She goes, where She shows the need
is of your awakening.

00:09:45.674 --> 00:09:52.796
All this works out because She is full
of compassion

00:09:52.997 --> 00:09:59.574
and love that you should get your absolute
truth.

00:09:59.775 --> 00:10:03.265
We have many problems as it is, you know,

00:10:03.466 --> 00:10:06.624
in Sahaja Yoga because when people
are ascending

00:10:06.825 --> 00:10:14.817
they carry on with them some of their
past stones and they cannot climb.

00:10:15.018 --> 00:10:20.845
They try then they fall, they try then they
fall, then they go up again, they fall.

00:10:21.046 --> 00:10:29.285
But today I’m going to tell you about what
is the state one has to achieve.

00:10:30.476 --> 00:10:35.168
As Shri Krishna has said it in the “Gita,”

00:10:35.369 --> 00:10:38.881
describes Stitha Pragya, the second
chapter,

00:10:39.082 --> 00:10:43.427
but it’s very difficult to understand Him,
He is not so clear cut as your Mother is.

00:10:43.628 --> 00:10:48.721
So people don’t understand what He is
saying. (Aside: “Can you close the...?”)

00:10:54.989 --> 00:11:00.854
And they ask the question, “How, how do you
reach that state of Stitha Pragya?

00:11:01.055 --> 00:11:05.047
How do you get to that stage?”

00:11:05.248 --> 00:11:08.158
But Gyaneshwara, when he wrote
his “Gyaneshwari,”

00:11:08.359 --> 00:11:15.731
he called it as the Sahaja Stithi, means
the state of Sahaj.

00:11:16.723 --> 00:11:22.748
He didn’t call Stitha Pragya. He called it
as Sahaja Stithi,

00:11:22.949 --> 00:11:29.417
meaning the state of Sahaj.

00:11:29.618 --> 00:11:35.415
So he describes the Sahaj in a very
beautiful manner and very subtle.

00:11:35.615 --> 00:11:40.639
Of course, Gyaneshwara also, very few
people understand, I think.

00:11:42.059 --> 00:11:49.665
A person who reaches that state is like
a mirror

00:11:49.951 --> 00:11:56.711
and so many faces pass over that mirror,
so many look into that mirror,

00:11:56.912 --> 00:12:06.235
so many decorate in front of the mirror,
but mirror is the same as it is.

00:12:06.436 --> 00:12:12.051
So the person who is a Stitha Pragya
or the person who is Sahaja

00:12:12.252 --> 00:12:21.196
is not bothered about what is facing him,
who is facing whom, where he is.

00:12:21.397 --> 00:12:28.346
He stays within himself. He contains
within himself.

00:12:28.547 --> 00:12:37.206
Like the sun. If the sun plays with
his different rays,

00:12:37.407 --> 00:12:42.007
he is not lost. All the rays again return
to him.

00:12:42.208 --> 00:12:52.330
In the same way, all the senses that we
have, all the senses

00:12:52.531 --> 00:13:00.451
that are there do play around, but for
a person who is in a Sahaja state

00:13:00.652 --> 00:13:05.203
it doesn’t matter, it makes no difference.
He’s not involved. He just plays around.

00:13:05.404 --> 00:13:12.346
Again, all of them come back to him.
This is a state you all have to achieve.

00:13:12.547 --> 00:13:16.930
Then you are really Sahaja Yogis.
But I still find people lost,

00:13:17.131 --> 00:13:22.853
getting money out of Sahaja Yoga, some
people lost getting out of leaderships,

00:13:23.054 --> 00:13:28.708
some are lost in getting jealousies
and envies and all that.

00:13:28.909 --> 00:13:33.828
So that means a lot of work has to be done,
still, within.

00:13:34.029 --> 00:13:39.468
There is no need to work as such if you
leave everything.

00:13:39.669 --> 00:13:43.171
That’s why I always say meditate, because
when you meditate,

00:13:43.372 --> 00:13:51.266
what happens, that all these things that
are pulling you down are finished.

00:13:51.467 --> 00:13:56.440
Gradually they disappear because you
become your Self.

00:13:56.641 --> 00:14:00.665
You get contained by yourself and you are
never bored.

00:14:00.865 --> 00:14:04.091
I am never bored. I don’t know what
boring word means, you see.

00:14:04.292 --> 00:14:09.732
When it is with you or alone, I never get
bored. What is there to get bored?

00:14:09.933 --> 00:14:14.522
If you are not involved into anything
you never get bored.

00:14:14.723 --> 00:14:19.957
Another thing is you rise above all these
things, like greed.

00:14:20.158 --> 00:14:24.192
Now people who are greedy are still
involved making money here,

00:14:24.393 --> 00:14:29.118
making money there, all that thing.
Those people who are still full of lust

00:14:29.319 --> 00:14:34.782
are still making, organizing, some things
like that.

00:14:34.983 --> 00:14:40.931
But in a Sahaj Stithi you just watch.
You are just a witness.

00:14:41.132 --> 00:14:47.423
You are not lost into anything that is
pulling you down.

00:14:47.624 --> 00:14:51.857
This state is not difficult to achieve
for you, at all,

00:14:52.058 --> 00:14:54.914
because you have crossed over your mind.

00:14:55.115 --> 00:14:58.990
Now all these things come to you through
your mind.

00:14:59.191 --> 00:15:04.599
I’ve already said that mind is a myth,
which you must accept.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:08.774
Myth is that this mind gives you ideas.

00:15:08.975 --> 00:15:12.488
Some people think, “Yes Mother, but -
yes Mother, but - .”

00:15:12.689 --> 00:15:17.987
This “but” is coming from your brain,
from your mind.

00:15:18.188 --> 00:15:23.779
The brain is reality, but not the mind.
The mind says “but”

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:28.306
and then you start feeling very depressed
sometimes, unhappy,

00:15:28.507 --> 00:15:32.373
because some people feel even bad because
they are very good people,

00:15:32.574 --> 00:15:37.168
that there are so few Sahaja Yogis.
Doesn’t matter.

00:15:38.146 --> 00:15:45.142
Just watch and this watching state, this
witness state is the Sahaja Stithi.

00:15:45.343 --> 00:15:49.623
In that you become so subtle, you become
your Self,

00:15:49.823 --> 00:15:56.050
meaning so subtle that nothing can disturb
you, nothing can change you.

00:15:56.251 --> 00:16:02.986
Now see the nature as it is. You know
there are ninety-two elements

00:16:03.187 --> 00:16:06.618
and ninety-two elements, none of them
can be...

00:16:06.819 --> 00:16:16.150
say for example, you cannot make silver
into gold. Gold into silver.

00:16:16.351 --> 00:16:21.999
The atoms are so arranged that they have
certain valencies

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:26.326
and apart from atom, even molecules
are so arranged

00:16:26.527 --> 00:16:30.792
that they have their own structure.
You cannot change.

00:16:30.993 --> 00:16:33.608
If you try to change then you will create
bombs,

00:16:33.816 --> 00:16:38.437
atomic bomb, this bomb. It’s absolutely
destructive.

00:16:38.638 --> 00:16:42.666
It’s only human beings who can change,
who can transform.

00:16:42.867 --> 00:16:48.932
Now look at the blessings that you are
a human being and you can be transformed

00:16:49.133 --> 00:16:55.526
and you can be made into a new element
that is the Self.

00:16:55.727 --> 00:16:58.385
This is the specialty of human beings.

00:16:58.586 --> 00:17:01.366
But if somebody there is a false guru
or somebody,

00:17:01.567 --> 00:17:04.575
he tries to do something, you’ll explode.

00:17:04.776 --> 00:17:09.312
I have seen people who have been to false
gurus, they still faint,

00:17:09.513 --> 00:17:13.382
they still have problems, they still get
troubled

00:17:13.583 --> 00:17:18.628
more than people who have been without
them.

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:21.697
They are also all right now, much of them
are improved;

00:17:21.898 --> 00:17:28.390
but this is one thing one should
understand, that in one way

00:17:28.591 --> 00:17:32.778
when you are analyzing and when you are
breaking an atom

00:17:32.979 --> 00:17:38.113
or you are breaking a molecule and trying
to transform,

00:17:38.314 --> 00:17:43.277
it explodes. It doesn’t work out.

00:17:43.478 --> 00:17:48.470
The other way round is that when you
try to synthesize,

00:17:48.671 --> 00:17:51.689
then you can form anything in the nature.

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:55.681
Like, this has now been brought out
by synthesizing,

00:17:55.882 --> 00:18:00.015
this plastic is created by synthesizing.

00:18:00.216 --> 00:18:05.171
Matter can be synthesized and can be
brought together

00:18:05.372 --> 00:18:11.202
and human beings have to get synthesized
also.

00:18:11.403 --> 00:18:20.162
They can be synthesized better than matter
because they change, they transform.

00:18:20.363 --> 00:18:29.329
Now say example, there is gold. You make
gold into ornaments, make into anything.

00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:37.721
It remains all the time, all the time gold.
Gold is gold. It is there.

00:18:37.922 --> 00:18:42.230
It is not that by changing them into
ornaments it changes.

00:18:42.431 --> 00:18:45.022
Its element is there. Gold is there.

00:18:45.223 --> 00:18:49.831
But for human beings they get transformed
when they are synthesized.

00:18:50.032 --> 00:18:59.329
This is a very big difference between the
matter and the nature and human beings.

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:05.795
Matter, nature are different absolutely
from human beings.

00:19:05.996 --> 00:19:13.255
Human beings, once they are transformed,
it’s like a living process.

00:19:13.456 --> 00:19:20.366
They become like flowers but still it is
not that you see in the nature.

00:19:20.567 --> 00:19:26.868
It’s not the same as you see in the nature
because nature doesn’t have a mind.

00:19:27.069 --> 00:19:33.822
It doesn’t have a mind. It just is under
the control

00:19:34.023 --> 00:19:38.605
of the Divine or nature that it’s working
out that way.

00:19:38.806 --> 00:19:43.962
But here you are under your own control.

00:19:45.073 --> 00:19:48.924
Here you can control yourself.

00:19:49.125 --> 00:19:54.503
In this synthesis which is growing inside
you what you find,

00:19:54.704 --> 00:19:59.006
that you are completely in control
of yourself.

00:19:59.207 --> 00:20:02.183
You know what is happening to you.

00:20:02.384 --> 00:20:07.525
Now you start seeing yourself separating
from all these things.

00:20:07.726 --> 00:20:13.320
Some people come and tell Me, “Mother, see,
my ego is very bad, you just take it out.”

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:17.866
He sees his ego, he sees what is
the problem is.

00:20:18.067 --> 00:20:22.288
Somebody says, “Mother, my Nabhi is
very bad,I’m still busy with the money.”

00:20:22.489 --> 00:20:29.105
He sees it. First starts the knowledge
about yourself,

00:20:29.306 --> 00:20:36.194
we call as self-knowledge. But one has
to even go beyond self-knowledge.

00:20:36.395 --> 00:20:40.635
By that knowledge, what do you do,
we have to see.

00:20:43.023 --> 00:20:48.764
When you have the knowledge, first we say
there’s no knowledge,

00:20:48.965 --> 00:20:52.213
people have no knowledge, they are
ignorant, there’s darkness, all that.

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:58.770
Now the light has come, you can see.
You can know what’s wrong with you.

00:20:58.971 --> 00:21:05.416
Now you start separating yourself from all
those things that you see as wrong with you.

00:21:05.617 --> 00:21:11.006
You see them getting out. So many
nonsensical things there are.

00:21:11.207 --> 00:21:15.904
Like, we have jealousies, envy, greed
and lust.

00:21:16.105 --> 00:21:20.257
I mean, it’s horrible things to say
on a Diwali function, see.

00:21:20.458 --> 00:21:27.267
So the Diwali is that one by one so many
lights are enlightened

00:21:27.467 --> 00:21:30.304
and you start seeing it first.

00:21:30.505 --> 00:21:34.315
First you start seeing what is wrong
within you,

00:21:34.517 --> 00:21:38.074
and then as you see it, you don’t want it.

00:21:38.275 --> 00:21:45.698
Then you work out to get rid of it,
to become clean.

00:21:45.899 --> 00:21:50.512
Now this also knowledge disappears.

00:21:50.713 --> 00:21:57.457
You don’t have to have any knowledge.
You are there. You are there.

00:21:57.658 --> 00:22:02.486
There is no need to know about your
chakras, you are just there.

00:22:02.687 --> 00:22:06.638
At that stage nothing matters.

00:22:06.839 --> 00:22:11.282
You become just like a stone, I can say.

00:22:11.483 --> 00:22:18.027
Stone with a brain intact and a heart
intact and a liver intact.

00:22:18.228 --> 00:22:23.206
You just don’t mind anything, don’t get
upset with anything.

00:22:23.407 --> 00:22:32.050
You just enjoy the love and compassion
that’s flowing.

00:22:32.251 --> 00:22:37.006
And the ripples that come back to you,
even that is lost after some time

00:22:37.207 --> 00:22:41.356
and you are just nothing but Sahaj.

00:22:42.205 --> 00:22:47.350
That is the state people achieved. In those
days they achieved this state.

00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:50.658
But with that, what lacking happened,
that they’d get lost.

00:22:50.859 --> 00:22:54.600
They all got lost. They couldn’t do
anything to others.

00:22:54.800 --> 00:23:00.307
One person getting it, becoming great,
finished. Or two persons at the most.

00:23:00.508 --> 00:23:04.287
So now Sahaja Yoga stands, first of all,

00:23:04.488 --> 00:23:08.686
at the knowledge state, where you have
the knowledge.

00:23:08.887 --> 00:23:13.568
First, you should first of all have full
knowledge about yourself.

00:23:13.769 --> 00:23:17.090
The self-knowledge should be complete.

00:23:17.291 --> 00:23:21.635
Then in the third stage we should say
that when the knowledge is full

00:23:21.836 --> 00:23:26.891
you should get rid of all those things
that you know about yourself,

00:23:27.092 --> 00:23:31.562
which are useless, which are hampering
your progress, which you know is wrong.

00:23:31.763 --> 00:23:37.310
Like, I see some dirt falling on my sari,
I’ll just clean it out like that.

00:23:37.511 --> 00:23:43.072
Then you start separating yourself
into that Sahaja state.

00:23:43.273 --> 00:23:49.258
But still in Sahaja Yoga you develop
another dimension

00:23:49.496 --> 00:23:56.379
which is collective consciousness. That is
the modern Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:56.580 --> 00:24:02.313
In the olden days they didn’t have this,
so they just all got lost.

00:24:02.514 --> 00:24:07.744
Now you have collective consciousness
and in that collective consciousness

00:24:07.945 --> 00:24:13.222
you start feeling others, feeling
for others, compassion for others

00:24:13.423 --> 00:24:19.871
and you start working out for others.
In that also, sometimes, you know,

00:24:20.072 --> 00:24:23.151
when you are working around, you think,
"How much money I can make?

00:24:23.352 --> 00:24:29.953
What I can achieve as a leader?" -
or some sort of thing is still there.

00:24:30.154 --> 00:24:33.981
But this collective consciousness starts
growing.

00:24:34.182 --> 00:24:37.450
When it starts growing, then you become
as I said,

00:24:37.651 --> 00:24:42.723
drop in the ocean, means complete ocean,
you become.

00:24:43.869 --> 00:24:51.151
You become complete ocean. So the ocean
has its own mariadas. It doesn’t bother.

00:24:51.352 --> 00:24:54.849
It has to live with its mariadas, it lives
with its mariadas.

00:24:55.049 --> 00:24:57.796
It doesn’t want to cross any boundaries,
all right.

00:24:57.997 --> 00:25:01.789
Accept it. It will not cross its
boundaries.

00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:06.663
In the same way it happens that you are
very self-contained.

00:25:06.864 --> 00:25:11.946
You are not selfish, but you become
very self-contained.

00:25:12.147 --> 00:25:15.891
You are contained within yourself.

00:25:16.092 --> 00:25:20.699
I know many Sahaja Yogis are angry that
I have not punished many horrible people

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:24.972
who have been troubling Sahaja Yoga.
I don’t have to bother.

00:25:25.173 --> 00:25:28.177
There’s Paramchaitanya which is doing
a lot of work.

00:25:28.378 --> 00:25:32.971
Let it look after it. Why should I bother
about anyone?

00:25:33.172 --> 00:25:38.319
You see, after all, things are working out
so why to interfere?

00:25:39.216 --> 00:25:47.996
My job is just to watch, just to see.
That’s sufficient.

00:25:48.197 --> 00:25:54.639
There’s no need for Me to kill anybody
in this lifetime or to destroy.

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:59.072
They are destroyed by themselves.
I have told you that

00:25:59.273 --> 00:26:03.641
I need not expose people, but whichever
country I go,

00:26:03.842 --> 00:26:07.501
I find people get exposed. I run away
from there, really, sometimes,

00:26:07.702 --> 00:26:11.402
thinking, "God knows what more is going
to come."

00:26:11.603 --> 00:26:17.382
Even little attention on any country,
it just works out.

00:26:17.583 --> 00:26:23.090
Even without My knowledge, “Oh My God,”
I said, “When did I do that?”

00:26:23.291 --> 00:26:31.894
So one has to become, of course, he becomes
the power of Divine love, no doubt.

00:26:32.095 --> 00:26:37.599
He becomes the power of Divine love,
but he doesn’t handle it.

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:40.731
Left to this Divine power which is working,

00:26:40.932 --> 00:26:46.862
which is also separated from Me, you’ll be
surprised. I am alone.

00:26:47.063 --> 00:26:52.236
Absolutely alone. Even this power is
separated from Me,

00:26:52.437 --> 00:26:56.334
but this power knows what is good for
human beings,

00:26:56.535 --> 00:27:00.372
what is good for Sahaja Yoga. It works
on its own.

00:27:00.573 --> 00:27:05.332
I don’t interfere. It’s a reflex action,
believe Me, it’s a reflex action.

00:27:05.533 --> 00:27:09.979
Maybe you might say, “Mother, you have
made it.” All right, whatever it is,

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:15.558
but I don’t interfere with it. I don’t have
to tell anything to it.

00:27:15.759 --> 00:27:18.786
It just works and it’s working so well.

00:27:18.987 --> 00:27:22.552
I’ll give you an example. Once in England
long time back,

00:27:22.753 --> 00:27:24.682
they said, “Mother, we want to have
a very long summer.”

00:27:24.883 --> 00:27:26.779
I said, “Why do you want to ask such
things?”

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:30.951
“No, no, Mother, we must have a long
summer, a very long summer, very - “

00:27:31.152 --> 00:27:38.661
Three or four times they said it and it was
a very long, horrible summer in London.

00:27:38.862 --> 00:27:42.583
And it’s not like India where we have
air conditioning, fans,

00:27:42.784 --> 00:27:47.078
something we have, at least hand fans.
There was nothing there.

00:27:47.279 --> 00:27:50.845
So we didn’t know. We had a little gallery,
we used to sleep in that.

00:27:51.046 --> 00:27:59.092
So we went to the shop in England and
we asked in London City, for a fan.

00:27:59.261 --> 00:28:03.141
So they said, “All right, after three
months. You order us.”

00:28:03.342 --> 00:28:07.466
After three months when it will be very
cold they will give us the fan.

00:28:07.667 --> 00:28:12.884
We said, “We don’t want any fans.”
So My daughter sent two fans by plane.

00:28:13.085 --> 00:28:16.282
And that’s how we managed. You see,
Indians, we feel very hot

00:28:16.483 --> 00:28:19.167
because we have had a lot of sun
in our country,

00:28:19.368 --> 00:28:22.684
we feel much hotter than any one of you.
The way you sit in the sun,

00:28:22.885 --> 00:28:26.728
you know, we can’t understand.
You know, in India they used to say,

00:28:26.929 --> 00:28:31.464
"An Englishman and a mad dog can only
go in the sun."

00:28:31.665 --> 00:28:34.971
So our situation is like that,

00:28:35.172 --> 00:28:38.086
that we cannot go in the sun because we
have had too much.

00:28:38.324 --> 00:28:43.307
And this summer, you see, was so
tremendous, so tremendous

00:28:43.508 --> 00:28:50.230
that after that one thing good happened.
That ochre color appeared on the leaves

00:28:50.431 --> 00:28:54.535
and then gradually the red and all that
of the autumn season

00:28:54.736 --> 00:28:59.135
was best at that time and then one Sahaja
Yogi dreamt that,

00:28:59.336 --> 00:29:03.040
“Mother asked me to drive in Her
back yard.”

00:29:03.241 --> 00:29:09.600
So he told everybody that, “Mother has been
asking me to drive in the back yard.”

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:13.234
So I telephoned to him, I didn’t know
he had dreamt like that,

00:29:13.472 --> 00:29:17.866
that, “Can you come along for a while,
I want to go and see this autumn

00:29:18.067 --> 00:29:23.013
all over England.” So he came and we were
driving, miles together

00:29:23.214 --> 00:29:27.906
and then they told Me, “Mother, it was so,
he told us that that was My back yard.”

00:29:28.107 --> 00:29:32.317
Can you imagine that he was driving
for miles together, beautiful,

00:29:32.531 --> 00:29:38.472
just like Canada, the whole England
was filled with the beauty of autumn.

00:29:38.673 --> 00:29:43.891
So even if there’s something like that
happens, it is compensated.

00:29:44.053 --> 00:29:49.731
It is compensated and so beautiful it was,
all the people were out in the autumn

00:29:49.932 --> 00:29:54.734
to see the beautiful colors of the nature,
of different greenery,

00:29:54.935 --> 00:29:59.264
yellow, ochre, all kinds of colors were
there.

00:29:59.465 --> 00:30:03.037
Surprisingly, in that country you never
see all that.

00:30:03.238 --> 00:30:08.837
And because of the sun shining so bright,
it was compensated.

00:30:09.038 --> 00:30:16.606
It was compensated by this Paramchaitanya.
So the Paramchaitanya is looking after this.

00:30:16.807 --> 00:30:23.419
All these things are managed by
Paramchaitanya. I am doing nothing.

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:27.190
I am Nishkriya. I’m just sitting down
and watching.

00:30:27.391 --> 00:30:32.142
To Me nothing matters. You see,
it’s working out slowly and steadily.

00:30:32.343 --> 00:30:34.971
Ha, if you tell Me something supposing,
they said,

00:30:35.172 --> 00:30:37.932
“Mother, we prayed to You and it happened.”
All right, maybe,

00:30:38.133 --> 00:30:43.225
these people must have heard, around Me.
Not me, you see,

00:30:43.426 --> 00:30:49.875
and they must have done the job and for
that I’m not responsible, in no way.

00:30:50.076 --> 00:30:55.275
Like one lady in Mexico had a son, was
very sick and was about to die.

00:30:55.476 --> 00:30:58.557
She wrote a letter to Me, three letters
she wrote

00:30:58.758 --> 00:31:03.568
that, “My son is going to die, he’s a young
fellow, studying in Harvard.”

00:31:03.769 --> 00:31:06.550
I didn’t do anything. I never wrote to her.

00:31:06.751 --> 00:31:10.180
Fourth letter came that he’s completely
cured. Now I didn’t do that

00:31:10.381 --> 00:31:14.592
because I was just sitting in one place
and how is it, it has worked out?

00:31:14.793 --> 00:31:19.786
So everything, you see, you think I do
is not done by Me.

00:31:19.987 --> 00:31:24.931
Is done by this Paramchaitanya. Because
I’m also separated from you, completely,

00:31:25.132 --> 00:31:29.563
absolutely separated. So they say,
“You pray, now.” You can pray.

00:31:29.764 --> 00:31:32.647
If you pray, you pray to these deities
that are around,

00:31:32.848 --> 00:31:36.572
you pray to all these ganas and all that,
not to Me.

00:31:36.773 --> 00:31:39.349
Because I have nothing to do with it.

00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:43.016
You see, they don’t tell Me that I have
to do this or I have to do that.

00:31:43.217 --> 00:31:46.941
So why should I tell them do this
or do that? It is like that.

00:31:47.142 --> 00:31:51.318
And in that state only we can say you are
in a Sahaja state,

00:31:51.519 --> 00:31:54.592
where you don’t desire anything, you don’t
want anything.

00:31:54.793 --> 00:31:59.695
I do everything. All kinds of things,
I am doing. Like the sun is doing,

00:31:59.896 --> 00:32:07.725
I am also doing in the sense that I’m
looking after things, flowers, this that.

00:32:07.925 --> 00:32:13.012
I am also receiving presents from you,
I’m receiving this from you

00:32:13.213 --> 00:32:17.321
and then see, I don’t receive anything.

00:32:17.522 --> 00:32:21.635
I don’t have anything. I have no
interest in it.

00:32:21.836 --> 00:32:24.489
But you want to give for your joy,
all right, have it.

00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:27.189
You want to put flowers, all right, you can
have flowers.

00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:32.683
Even if there’s flowers or not makes no
difference to Me as a person, I’m saying.

00:32:32.884 --> 00:32:38.960
But as Your Mother I love you.
All of you I love.

00:32:39.214 --> 00:32:42.206
But I don’t do anything as such to love
you. And everybody says,

00:32:42.407 --> 00:32:47.140
“Mother, You love us so much.” When? When
did I love you? I never even kissed you.

00:32:47.341 --> 00:32:51.124
But you always say I love you very much.
So what is this?

00:32:51.325 --> 00:32:56.987
Who is working it out, this? Is something
which is not Me, beyond Me.

00:32:57.188 --> 00:33:01.822
This is the state in which, once we rise,
we call it as Sahaja Stithi.

00:33:02.023 --> 00:33:07.375
In the Sahaja Stithi you think you are
doing nothing. Everything is working out.

00:33:07.576 --> 00:33:11.501
But at this stage if I tell you, you say,
“Oh, we are not doing anything.

00:33:11.723 --> 00:33:15.455
Why should we spread Sahaja Yoga?
It’s not our job.”

00:33:15.656 --> 00:33:20.177
Just now, that’s not your stithi,
that’s why.

00:33:20.378 --> 00:33:23.367
So you have to rise up to that state.

00:33:23.568 --> 00:33:29.268
That’s only possible when you are
in the knowledge state,

00:33:29.469 --> 00:33:32.609
where you have self-knowledge, the knowledge
of the whole world.

00:33:32.836 --> 00:33:36.398
But if you go beyond knowledge then you
must have seen many a times,

00:33:36.599 --> 00:33:42.076
I just say something. I just say something
and it is there.

00:33:42.277 --> 00:33:45.425
I never feel vibrations of anyone
or anything.

00:33:45.626 --> 00:33:48.931
I don’t feel My Kundalini, either nor
any chakras, nothing,

00:33:49.132 --> 00:33:52.633
but I know, know automatically like
a computer.

00:33:52.834 --> 00:33:58.063
But that computer also I am not. Just it’s
trouble, it’s difficult to explain to you

00:33:58.264 --> 00:34:01.700
what is this stithi is because you have
to achieve it.

00:34:01.901 --> 00:34:06.386
Once you achieve it then you are
in a very subtle state

00:34:06.587 --> 00:34:15.432
and that subtle state is nothing but bliss.
But that bliss also you cannot enjoy.

00:34:15.662 --> 00:34:23.073
I don’t know how to enjoy everything.
Supposing now you say, “Jai Mataji.”

00:34:23.274 --> 00:34:29.215
I forget even you are calling Me.
I also say, “Jai Mataji,” finished.

00:34:29.416 --> 00:34:34.058
See it is such a simple thing one has
to understand

00:34:34.258 --> 00:34:37.728
that the state in which one has to rise

00:34:37.929 --> 00:34:42.049
is a state where without doing anything,
everything works out.

00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:45.546
If that is your state, all right. But it’s
not so.

00:34:45.747 --> 00:34:50.523
So you have to rise up to that state
by doing. First you have to do it.

00:34:50.724 --> 00:34:57.397
First you have to know and then knowledge
has no need, you don’t have to know,

00:34:57.598 --> 00:35:01.925
but first that has to be worked out
and brought to that level.

00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:07.019
Now Diwali has the significance that
on Diwali day, what we do,

00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:15.137
we put lights all over. So that we put
Sahaja Yoga everywhere.

00:35:15.338 --> 00:35:19.946
But does the light know about itself?

00:35:23.136 --> 00:35:31.712
Does the candle knows about itself? She
enlightens everything but she doesn’t know.

00:35:34.506 --> 00:35:41.370
Like the moon, which is giving moonlight,
does it know itself?

00:35:41.571 --> 00:35:46.242
Does he enjoy? Nothing.

00:35:47.646 --> 00:35:51.700
In the same way it happens that
on a Diwali day you are,

00:35:51.901 --> 00:35:55.505
what you are doing is enlightening people,
you are enlightening them,

00:35:55.706 --> 00:36:00.828
you are doing all this for them,
it’s a good idea. You must do it.

00:36:01.029 --> 00:36:07.447
But also know that you have to become the
lamp yourself which doesn’t know yourself.

00:36:08.701 --> 00:36:14.063
So there are two messages. The first one is
that we have to enlighten the world,

00:36:14.264 --> 00:36:17.130
we have to enlighten others. This is
the first one.

00:36:17.331 --> 00:36:25.243
Then we have to become that which is the
light itself and light itself doesn’t know.

00:36:25.444 --> 00:36:28.749
Yesterday you were singing, “You are
the light,” you are this thing.

00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:36.300
All right, so what? I was just saying,
‘Yes, I am the light, I don’t know Myself.”

00:36:36.501 --> 00:36:40.220
That’s the state where you don’t know
you are the light.

00:36:40.421 --> 00:36:43.454
You just don’t know that. It doesn’t come
into your head.

00:36:43.655 --> 00:36:47.722
Even so many times you have sung, you have
said thousand names there are, everything,

00:36:47.923 --> 00:36:53.949
but it doesn’t come into My head that
this is Me you are talking about.

00:36:54.306 --> 00:36:58.240
Now when I say this I don’t know how
you will react.

00:36:58.441 --> 00:37:02.869
Because human beings are queer birds,
you see. You tell them something.

00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:09.828
Maybe that your ego might come up and you
say, “Yes, yes, I am also just the same.”

00:37:10.029 --> 00:37:13.606
There are many, many who came like
that, that, “I am higher than Mataji.”

00:37:13.807 --> 00:37:20.832
Ba, ba maybe, I don’t know. There are
many who said that, “I am Kalki.”

00:37:21.033 --> 00:37:25.245
Nowadays there’s one fellow going round
saying, “I am Kalki, I am this, I am that.”

00:37:25.446 --> 00:37:30.869
All right, doesn’t matter. You be that,
very good idea.

00:37:41.386 --> 00:37:49.814
But if I say I am Adi Shakti that means
I don’t know what I am, really.

00:37:50.015 --> 00:37:52.776
I had to say because people said,
“Mother, you have to declare.”

00:37:52.977 --> 00:37:57.189
Declare what? Whatever I am, that I am.

00:37:57.390 --> 00:38:01.728
Now I find by declaration you people
started

00:38:01.929 --> 00:38:05.500
growing more, so all right, have it
that way.

00:38:05.701 --> 00:38:11.253
But there is no need for anyone to declare
anything or to say anything.

00:38:11.454 --> 00:38:18.839
That is the state one has to achieve.
But to get to that state you have to work.

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:25.153
And work is to spread Sahaja Yoga.
You have to enlighten many lights.

00:38:25.354 --> 00:38:30.368
That means you will realize that you are
the light which is enlightening all that,

00:38:30.569 --> 00:38:36.254
and then in a subtle way you will realize
that, “I am the light.”

00:38:36.455 --> 00:38:40.863
Many Sahaja Yogis are doing a lot of work
and working it out,

00:38:41.064 --> 00:38:45.794
spreading Sahaja Yoga. It’s a very great
thing that has happened.

00:38:45.995 --> 00:38:48.855
In so many countries, the way it has
spread,

00:38:49.056 --> 00:38:54.324
it has removed the darkness of religion
which was outside.

00:38:54.525 --> 00:39:02.917
It was darkness of so many - racialism,
thisism, thatism, all it has removed.

00:39:03.118 --> 00:39:10.418
So this has worked out, the cleansing.
For you to have the clean water to swim.

00:39:10.619 --> 00:39:17.323
Once you start doing that then you realize
gradually

00:39:17.524 --> 00:39:24.462
that now the sea is clean, we just watch,
we just see how it is working.

00:39:24.663 --> 00:39:28.519
I hope in your lifetime only, you achieve
this state

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:36.914
where you achieve your complete work
of self-realization to others.

00:39:37.115 --> 00:39:41.133
Those who do not give self-realization
to others, who just come for the pujas,

00:39:41.334 --> 00:39:45.712
this thing, are mediocres. They cannot
rise very high.

00:39:45.913 --> 00:39:49.278
This coming to puja is what, like, you just
rise higher with the puja

00:39:49.479 --> 00:39:53.345
then again you go down. But those
who steadily grow

00:39:53.546 --> 00:39:57.491
will grow into this state, I am sure,
in My lifetime

00:39:57.692 --> 00:40:02.189
I should be able to see such people
who are such that if they stand here

00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:07.531
they emit peace, they emit light, they emit
everything. Because they are the light.

00:40:07.732 --> 00:40:11.005
They don’t have to enlighten, but they
are the light.

00:40:11.206 --> 00:40:16.726
Such a stage has to be developed
and to be worked out within yourself.

00:40:16.927 --> 00:40:20.336
And this state has been described
by so many poets,

00:40:20.537 --> 00:40:24.709
so many saints and everything, but they
were at that stage

00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:27.913
and people thought, what is this they
are talking? They thought they were mad.

00:40:28.114 --> 00:40:30.555
Even for Christ, they thought He is to be
crucified,

00:40:30.756 --> 00:40:34.815
because they couldn’t understand it.
Now you are gradually growing

00:40:35.016 --> 00:40:39.573
one by one, step by step, step by step,
so now you understand this.

00:40:39.774 --> 00:40:42.332
You understand Christ, you understand
all these people

00:40:42.533 --> 00:40:46.391
and at this stage you have still to work.

00:40:46.592 --> 00:40:49.976
Those who do not work for Sahaja Yoga
cannot rise higher.

00:40:50.177 --> 00:40:54.841
You have to work for Sahaja Yoga, you have
to spread it more,

00:40:55.042 --> 00:41:00.038
you have to work it out, enjoy each other,
this brotherhood, everything.

00:41:00.244 --> 00:41:08.161
All the qualities of a beautiful
personality should be there.

00:41:08.362 --> 00:41:15.900
Unless and until you achieve that state,
then you can only rise higher to that stage

00:41:16.101 --> 00:41:20.979
which I am describing is a Sahaja Stithi.
In that state you will be perfect.

00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:28.494
But you must get rid of all these things
and today is a day, also of Mahalakshmi.

00:41:28.732 --> 00:41:33.129
The first thing is, I think, this madness
about money.

00:41:33.330 --> 00:41:37.063
This should be understood that it’s
real madness.

00:41:37.264 --> 00:41:40.103
Those who are rich have no money.
You ask a rich man, he’ll say,

00:41:40.304 --> 00:41:45.224
“Oh, I have no money.” Why? What is this
all this? This is no money.

00:41:45.425 --> 00:41:49.292
You ask the poor man, he has no money.
A rich man has no money.

00:41:49.493 --> 00:41:56.744
So it’s a kind of a greed which is never
satisfied, which never helps you.

00:41:56.945 --> 00:42:01.844
All these little, little things have
to first drop out.

00:42:02.045 --> 00:42:04.801
Then your work should cleanse you.
In your work you will know

00:42:05.002 --> 00:42:07.639
whether you are cleansing or not.
In the work you will know

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:14.095
how you are doing your work. Once that
is done, then I think I am sure

00:42:14.296 --> 00:42:19.663
some of you will achieve that state
in My lifetime, in your lifetime.

00:42:19.864 --> 00:42:23.257
That’s what I want today to tell you,
on a Diwali day,

00:42:23.458 --> 00:42:28.158
that we have to become subtler and subtler
and subtler.

00:42:28.359 --> 00:42:32.322
We should not be influenced by outside
things.

00:42:32.759 --> 00:42:39.439
Like, the outside thing is that, some sort
of a fashion starts.

00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:45.892
People who follow fashions are stupid.
They are like blind mices.

00:42:46.093 --> 00:42:50.531
Anybody can lead them into anything,
now do this, they do it. That, they do it.

00:42:50.732 --> 00:42:55.628
So if you try to follow any kind
of a thought

00:42:55.829 --> 00:42:58.841
which is given to us by somebody else,

00:42:59.042 --> 00:43:03.054
in that thought you’ll completely lose
yourself and you'll become,

00:43:03.255 --> 00:43:10.551
"I am this, I am Christian, I am Hindu,
I am Muslim, I am Muss leman." Stupidity.

00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:19.361
You are your Self. You are the Spirit.
And when you become the Spirit

00:43:19.562 --> 00:43:24.875
then you start knowing so much and that
knowledge is very important.

00:43:25.076 --> 00:43:30.717
This is the gap between a saint and
a normal human being,

00:43:30.918 --> 00:43:34.227
which you have crossed gradually so you
know what are the problems

00:43:34.428 --> 00:43:37.774
of the human beings are and dealing
with human beings,

00:43:37.975 --> 00:43:41.293
you know how to deal with them.

00:43:41.531 --> 00:43:46.251
In Sahaja Yoga only the collective
consciousness, in modern times, has come.

00:43:46.452 --> 00:43:52.746
This collective consciousness, also
the saints had, but they would not say.

00:43:52.947 --> 00:43:57.213
They would not say anything. They would
not bother.

00:43:57.414 --> 00:44:02.059
All right, this fellow has this chakra,
let him go to hell. Doesn’t care.

00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:05.286
It’s not a question of not caring, but
not bothered.

00:44:05.487 --> 00:44:10.254
They were sitting in a state which
was just recording, all right.

00:44:10.455 --> 00:44:13.670
An ugly man goes before the mirror,
all right,

00:44:13.871 --> 00:44:17.775
if a beautiful person goes before
the mirror is all right.

00:44:17.976 --> 00:44:25.101
In the same way these people start
allowing people to pass through

00:44:25.302 --> 00:44:28.167
but we have to understand, still we
have to grow.

00:44:28.368 --> 00:44:31.863
We have to still grow by working it out.

00:44:32.064 --> 00:44:38.050
Those people who are working it out
and spreading it all over

00:44:38.251 --> 00:44:43.599
are the ones which are really very
much there

00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:53.439
and to them, I must say, the Paramchaitanya
is just their servant.

00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:59.517
I have seen people who desire something,
it works out.

00:44:59.718 --> 00:45:02.761
They ask for something, it works out.

00:45:02.931 --> 00:45:06.563
For that, now, what should we have,
is the point.

00:45:06.764 --> 00:45:11.878
After getting realization, after getting
everything, what should we have

00:45:12.079 --> 00:45:17.908
that we develop is the faith.
Faith in yourself.

00:45:18.109 --> 00:45:24.508
Faith in that you are the Spirit,

00:45:24.709 --> 00:45:30.507
that you have the light and you have
to enlighten others.

00:45:32.721 --> 00:45:37.016
This faith when it grows deeper and
deeper then you think,

00:45:37.216 --> 00:45:42.805
"Oh, what I am? I am the Spirit."

00:45:43.006 --> 00:45:48.317
If you are the Spirit then this whole
nature is with you.

00:45:48.518 --> 00:45:55.126
I know of some Sahaja Yogis. One of them
was a fisherman.

00:45:55.327 --> 00:45:59.520
He was doing Sahaja Yoga work. He has
tremendous faith in Me

00:45:59.721 --> 00:46:05.773
and somehow he was going to another
village to do Sahaja Yoga work.

00:46:05.974 --> 00:46:14.060
When he came out of his little hut he found
it’s all full of clouds, black clouds.

00:46:14.261 --> 00:46:17.197
So he raised his hand and said, “See now,
I’m going for Mother’s work.

00:46:17.383 --> 00:46:22.392
And you dare not start raining. You keep
as you are, hanging there

00:46:22.593 --> 00:46:26.948
till I finish my work,” you see. Because
he was going by boat.

00:46:27.149 --> 00:46:30.561
And other Sahaja Yogis thought,
“What is he talking about?”

00:46:30.762 --> 00:46:34.041
They all got into the boat, they reached
the other village.

00:46:34.242 --> 00:46:37.803
They gave realization to others,
he finished his lecturing, everything,

00:46:38.004 --> 00:46:41.068
he came back on the shore and he entered
his house.

00:46:41.269 --> 00:46:47.062
When he was closing the door, “All right,
so go ahead,” he said. And he managed.

00:46:47.263 --> 00:46:52.624
So the complete faith that this
Paramchaitanya is like your servant,

00:46:52.825 --> 00:46:58.789
is all the time waiting there to serve you.
Whatever you say will happen.

00:46:58.990 --> 00:47:05.097
But first you must have complete faith
in yourself that you are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:47:05.298 --> 00:47:08.521
Even now I find, you see, people have
some lust,

00:47:08.722 --> 00:47:12.867
some sort of a horrible things in them.

00:47:13.068 --> 00:47:18.972
So first you must be established in Dharma.
Dharma, is, as you know, is righteousness.

00:47:19.173 --> 00:47:22.520
If you are in the righteousness, there’s
no question.

00:47:22.721 --> 00:47:26.079
There’s no question that this
Paramchaitanya won’t obey you.

00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:31.585
But supposing you want today something
and it doesn’t work out,

00:47:31.786 --> 00:47:36.068
then even to get disappointed itself
is not a very good thing.

00:47:36.269 --> 00:47:45.108
Disappointment also is a sign of your
immaturity.

00:47:45.309 --> 00:47:48.595
What is there to be disappointed?

00:47:50.321 --> 00:47:55.602
Maybe that that was good for you. Supposing
I lose My way.

00:47:55.803 --> 00:48:00.360
I’m going this way and I lose My way,
I don’t know where to go.

00:48:00.561 --> 00:48:05.007
So I get lost, it’s all right. What is
there? Wherever I am, I am there.

00:48:05.208 --> 00:48:08.388
How can I be lost to Myself? And then
what I find,

00:48:08.589 --> 00:48:12.809
that I had to go that way because I was
to meet somebody,

00:48:13.010 --> 00:48:16.860
I’ve been wanting to meet somebody and
meet that person there.

00:48:17.061 --> 00:48:21.041
Can you imagine? Such things happen
with Me,

00:48:21.242 --> 00:48:24.806
and even if I don’t meet, so what? I was
to go that side.

00:48:25.007 --> 00:48:28.176
I have to leave some vibrations, perhaps.
It’s like that.

00:48:28.377 --> 00:48:35.898
So once you know that whatever you are
doing in command, full command,

00:48:36.099 --> 00:48:43.087
full faith, actually the whole authority
comes to you through your faith

00:48:43.288 --> 00:48:47.975
which word is satta in Sanskrit, meaning
the truth.

00:48:48.176 --> 00:48:52.082
The truth gives you the authority. If you
have the truth with you,

00:48:52.283 --> 00:48:55.396
you have the absolute truth with you
then you have the authority

00:48:55.597 --> 00:49:02.826
and the authority is such that that
authorizes you, not others, but to you.

00:49:03.027 --> 00:49:07.244
This authority that you have works
and works.

00:49:07.445 --> 00:49:11.476
I've seen with simple Sahaja Yogis,
very simple uneducated also,

00:49:11.677 --> 00:49:16.777
are very powerful Sahaja Yogis, are very
powerful Sahaja Yogis.

00:49:16.978 --> 00:49:21.306
But they have one thing, is faith,
complete faith.

00:49:21.507 --> 00:49:27.221
Then another word in Sanskrit is titiksha,
means patience,

00:49:27.422 --> 00:49:32.967
saburi - patience. You must have patience.

00:49:33.168 --> 00:49:35.959
If you don't have patience, you want
immediately something to be done.

00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:38.717
How will you see the whole thing
working out?

00:49:38.926 --> 00:49:46.509
Many people are extremely jittery and
very fast-running.

00:49:46.710 --> 00:49:52.640
This world is running so fast and you are
the ones who have stood out

00:49:52.841 --> 00:49:56.263
and watching this rat race. You are not
one of them.

00:49:56.464 --> 00:50:00.682
So must have titiksha, means you must
have patience.

00:50:00.883 --> 00:50:05.285
So you must have faith in yourself fully
and also patience,

00:50:05.486 --> 00:50:11.464
how Sahaja Yoga is working out or how
this Paramchaitanya is working out.

00:50:11.665 --> 00:50:15.807
If it works this way, all right, that way,
all right. It is some meaning.

00:50:16.008 --> 00:50:22.402
If it works this way, there's some meaning.
If it is that way it has some meaning.

00:50:22.612 --> 00:50:31.793
Now the another thing which is important
is the faith in your guru.

00:50:31.994 --> 00:50:38.699
If you have faith in your guru,
Paramchaitanya is kind to you.

00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:44.380
It’s very helpful. But if you doubt, then
Paramchaitanya also doubts you

00:50:44.581 --> 00:50:47.932
because Paramchaitanya knows you through
your guru,

00:50:48.133 --> 00:50:53.069
whether it is Me or any other real guru,
it’s the same.

00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:57.179
But with Me, of course, because, you know,
I’m very forgiving

00:50:57.380 --> 00:51:03.293
so people start taking liberties. With
another guru, you see, he will beat them.

00:51:03.494 --> 00:51:07.937
He’ll do all kinds of horrible things
to you if you are not there.

00:51:08.138 --> 00:51:11.028
So I’ve told you many stories about
the gurus, how they treat -

00:51:11.229 --> 00:51:14.791
good gurus - their disciples.
But I forgive.

00:51:14.992 --> 00:51:17.857
I don’t say anything. Let it be,
it doesn’t matter.

00:51:18.058 --> 00:51:21.092
Because I think by leaving them alone only
they will rise

00:51:21.293 --> 00:51:23.428
and they will come up to this stage.

00:51:23.629 --> 00:51:27.801
But it happens sometimes that it may work
the other way round,

00:51:28.002 --> 00:51:36.710
that if they are forgiven, then they take
it for granted. It's all right.

00:51:36.911 --> 00:51:40.207
There is freedom, you can take it for
granted, you can do what you like.

00:51:40.408 --> 00:51:44.839
You can get lost, you can... I have nothing
to say.

00:51:45.389 --> 00:51:50.064
So the faith in yourself is with patience
you watch

00:51:50.273 --> 00:51:54.280
and do not get disappointed with anything
whatsoever.

00:51:54.481 --> 00:51:57.860
Now, just imagine so many people have got
realization,

00:51:58.061 --> 00:52:00.859
so many saints in this world, have you
seen?

00:52:01.060 --> 00:52:05.538
Yesterday I was surprised the way
the French were singing so well.

00:52:05.738 --> 00:52:08.322
You know, first time I had to take
a harmonium

00:52:08.523 --> 00:52:14.914
to teach them how to sing one line.
Half an hour I tried, I couldn’t do.

00:52:16.701 --> 00:52:21.437
The same French have reached that state
of creativity.

00:52:21.638 --> 00:52:26.847
You see, all your potential will rise.
It will express itself,

00:52:27.048 --> 00:52:30.915
but be careful not to get into ego
about it.

00:52:31.116 --> 00:52:35.678
Gradually it will flower and others
who are surrounding you

00:52:35.879 --> 00:52:39.471
will get the fragrance of it and they’ll
come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:52:39.672 --> 00:52:44.819
That is the blessing at that time,
the blessing of the real Divine will be

00:52:45.020 --> 00:52:51.982
that you’ll be raised to the state which we
call as a perfect, ‘purnatva’, complete.

00:52:52.183 --> 00:52:56.505
That completeness will come. But you
judge yourself.

00:52:56.706 --> 00:53:04.144
Are you absolutely one with Sahaj? Are you
absolutely dedicated to Sahaj?

00:53:04.358 --> 00:53:10.935
Or other things are more important to you
than Sahaja Yoga? Then, go ahead.

00:53:13.916 --> 00:53:17.997
There is something to be understood
very clearly

00:53:18.198 --> 00:53:21.638
that there’s no competition in Sahaja Yoga.
Cannot be.

00:53:21.839 --> 00:53:28.781
There’s no competition. There’s no envy,
there is no back biting, nothing.

00:53:28.982 --> 00:53:32.266
It is, you are different people. You are
saints.

00:53:32.467 --> 00:53:38.725
Your style is different. You are absolutely
above all these things.

00:53:38.926 --> 00:53:43.340
You cannot be dishonest, you cannot cheat
people, you cannot do this.

00:53:43.541 --> 00:53:47.724
And if you are doing that, even now,
then please try to understand

00:53:47.925 --> 00:53:52.214
that you have still to grow into it.

00:53:52.415 --> 00:53:56.892
Some big people think they are very
high up in Sahaja Yoga.

00:53:57.093 --> 00:54:01.304
It’s not so, it’s not so.

00:54:01.505 --> 00:54:08.455
If by thinking what you are, then
you are lost.

00:54:09.225 --> 00:54:13.482
What you have to do is to understand
“What have I done?

00:54:13.683 --> 00:54:18.519
How many people have I given realization,
to how many people have talked about it?”

00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:21.476
People are shy, even, to talk about
Sahaja Yoga.

00:54:21.677 --> 00:54:24.899
I have seen one lady was traveling
with Me. Very hot. I said, “Ba, ba

00:54:25.100 --> 00:54:28.684
who is she, this one? I don’t know.”
So she told Me the name of her guru.

00:54:28.885 --> 00:54:32.132
She said, “My guru is like this, guru
like that, like that.”

00:54:32.333 --> 00:54:36.453
I said, “My God, this heat coming out
of this woman and she’s talking so much.”

00:54:36.654 --> 00:54:40.936
But a Sahaja Yogi will not tell anybody
what is Sahaja Yoga.

00:54:41.137 --> 00:54:45.417
They feel shy. They’ll have a hundred
friends, they’ll meet a hundred friends

00:54:45.618 --> 00:54:49.748
but they will never tell them what Sahaja
Yoga is. They’ll be shy to tell them.

00:54:49.949 --> 00:54:53.782
Ah, they wouldn’t mind going to parties,
you see, if the others are drinking,

00:54:53.983 --> 00:54:57.713
they’ll say, “All right, I don’t drink.”
But they’ll not say, “I’m a Sahaja Yogi,

00:54:57.914 --> 00:55:03.678
I cannot drink, by nature I cannot drink.”
They will not say that.

00:55:03.879 --> 00:55:09.256
So this is the third point, one has to know
the announcement.

00:55:09.457 --> 00:55:13.126
You must have faith in yourself and you
must announce.

00:55:13.327 --> 00:55:16.283
All the saints announced. They were
killed for that,

00:55:16.484 --> 00:55:21.142
you saw how Socrates was given poison.
Doesn’t matter.

00:55:21.343 --> 00:55:23.963
Nobody’s going to kill you now, in these
modern times,

00:55:24.164 --> 00:55:26.062
there’s fundamental rights to exist.

00:55:26.263 --> 00:55:29.506
So nobody can kill you, take it from Me,
but you must announce.

00:55:29.707 --> 00:55:32.436
And the announcement should be
with full faith

00:55:32.637 --> 00:55:38.549
and understanding about Sahaja Yoga,
how important it is.

00:55:38.750 --> 00:55:44.549
The purpose is to transform the whole
world.

00:55:44.750 --> 00:55:48.154
With your transformation the whole world
transforms.

00:55:48.355 --> 00:55:54.733
It’s a very complicated thing, otherwise,
Sahaja Yoga is extremely complicated

00:55:54.934 --> 00:56:01.647
because how it works. The other day, you
remember, the mike had failed completely

00:56:01.848 --> 00:56:06.332
and I was giving the lecture and still
I was talking.

00:56:06.533 --> 00:56:12.315
The mike had failed but everybody was
listening to Me. What had happened?

00:56:12.516 --> 00:56:16.407
Did I enter into the ether? What happened?
I don’t know.

00:56:16.608 --> 00:56:20.825
I didn’t even know that mike had failed.
I was thinking there is mike,

00:56:21.026 --> 00:56:24.212
that the way people were listening to Me,

00:56:24.427 --> 00:56:28.230
but then they told that half lecture was
without the mike.

00:56:28.431 --> 00:56:34.314
And everybody was absolutely listening
to Me.

00:56:34.515 --> 00:56:45.770
You see, it is something that one has
to wonder and appreciate

00:56:45.971 --> 00:56:49.221
what things are happening now, where are
we going.

00:56:49.422 --> 00:56:52.428
We are going into the Kingdom of God

00:56:52.629 --> 00:56:56.894
and all the blessings, all the bliss
will be on you.

00:56:57.095 --> 00:57:04.537
Then this bliss, knowledge, everything
becomes one, nothing but bliss

00:57:04.738 --> 00:57:12.044
and you are in that state of bliss which
you don’t even know, we are just there.

00:57:12.245 --> 00:57:18.202
The greatest bliss is that you don’t know
even anything, you’re just there.

00:57:18.403 --> 00:57:23.371
I hope all of you achieve that state with
this Diwali being done in Portugal,

00:57:23.571 --> 00:57:26.969
which is a special place, I think,
of Mahalakshmi

00:57:27.215 --> 00:57:32.154
because She appeared here as they say
and also this swayambhu that we have,

00:57:32.355 --> 00:57:37.580
also is that of Mahalakshmi face, so I’m
sure it will work out for all of you.

00:57:37.743 --> 00:57:44.767
It’s a little subtle state I’m talking
about but it is, I have to tell you,

00:57:44.968 --> 00:57:47.971
that one has to rise up to that state

00:57:48.172 --> 00:57:52.961
and that state is very, very easy
to achieve for you.

00:57:53.162 --> 00:57:56.747
It slowly, gradually it - then you don’t
have to do anything,

00:57:56.947 --> 00:58:00.580
you go into a village and everything would
be there. See, now, what happened.

00:58:00.781 --> 00:58:06.021
I went to Cairo. Everybody was saluting Me.
I was wondering, what has happened to them?

00:58:06.222 --> 00:58:09.363
I went to Leningrad, thousands came
to My program.

00:58:09.564 --> 00:58:11.966
I asked them, “How did you come
to My program?” They said,

00:58:12.167 --> 00:58:15.600
“It’s obvious from Your face, it’s
obvious.”

00:58:15.769 --> 00:58:18.727
They just saw a small, little advertisement
in the newspaper,

00:58:18.928 --> 00:58:23.563
“It’s obvious that You are Divine.”
That should happen.

00:58:23.764 --> 00:58:29.040
And then you can announce that Sahaja Yoga
is the only way, then you can announce.

00:58:29.241 --> 00:58:34.427
There’s no harm. People feel very shy to say
something to their friends and things.

00:58:34.628 --> 00:58:38.454
And you must know that all of those
who you love, who you know,

00:58:38.655 --> 00:58:42.633
will go to hell or where - they’ll hang
in the limbo or what?

00:58:42.834 --> 00:58:45.652
If you have achieved it you should pull
them out also.

00:58:45.853 --> 00:58:49.584
They may not. They may not be seekers,
doesn’t matter now.

00:58:49.785 --> 00:58:52.604
I think we are finished with the seekers
now, must be -

00:58:52.805 --> 00:58:58.450
we must have people who are not so seeking,
it looks like that.

00:58:58.651 --> 00:59:02.242
So, may God bless you all.
