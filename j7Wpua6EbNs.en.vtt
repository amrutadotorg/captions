WEBVTT

05:17.810 --> 05:26.616
Today, we are going to worship
the Mahalakshmi

05:26.817 --> 05:32.675
which I think is very much worshipped
in this country

05:32.876 --> 05:36.715
where they worship Her as Maria

05:36.916 --> 05:42.903
and also there’s a swayambhu of Maria,
you must have seen.

05:43.104 --> 05:49.522
And also there was an apparition of Her.
First I never believed that it could be,

05:49.723 --> 05:55.935
but then after feeling the vibrations,
now I know it was true,

05:56.136 --> 05:59.691
that She did appear here in an apparition.

05:59.892 --> 06:05.517
She appeared before Me, also, you must
have seen, in a photograph.

06:10.540 --> 06:19.364
This is the principle by which you have
risen to this state.

06:19.565 --> 06:25.952
The central path of your ascent is created
by Mahalakshmi power

06:26.153 --> 06:29.920
for the Kundalini to rise.

06:30.121 --> 06:33.593
In the temple of Mahalakshmi in Kolhapur

06:33.794 --> 06:37.556
they always sing the song of “Ude, Ude,
Ambe.”

06:37.757 --> 06:46.295
So I asked the people there, “Why do you
sing Ambe’s song in Mahalakshmi’s temple?”

06:46.496 --> 06:53.456
So they said that, “We don’t know why
we do it, but is it wrong?”

06:53.657 --> 07:01.752
I said, “No, because only in the
Mahalakshmi channel

07:01.953 --> 07:07.632
Kundalini can rise and Kundalini is
the Amba.”

07:07.833 --> 07:11.973
That’s how, you see, they understood
and they were really amazed

07:12.174 --> 07:16.059
that I explained it very well ‘cause
from ancient times

07:16.260 --> 07:23.358
this song has been sung there and they
never knew why this song is sung.

07:25.267 --> 07:33.513
Coming to the point of Mahalakshmi, we have
to understand what does it do,

07:33.714 --> 07:41.687
what it’s help is that this Mahalakshmi
channel or the Mahalakshmi’s powers

07:41.888 --> 07:54.057
have created within us a proper balance,
a proper route for Kundalini to rise.

07:54.258 --> 07:59.880
Left and right has been balanced and She
is the one who creates

08:00.081 --> 08:09.338
and makes a wider path for Kundalini
to rise.

08:09.544 --> 08:16.941
This is the path of compassion and love.

08:17.142 --> 08:21.600
Through that compassion and love
She creates this path

08:21.801 --> 08:29.665
because She knows that if the path is not
wide enough the Kundalini cannot rise.

08:29.866 --> 08:36.300
Ultimately, one reaches a state where you
start seeking

08:36.501 --> 08:41.924
and when you start seeking, your
Mahalakshmi principle has been awakened.

08:42.125 --> 08:46.767
That is awakened and sometimes it is
very strong.

08:46.968 --> 08:50.274
Then you start seeking in a mad way.

08:50.475 --> 08:54.475
I am sorry to say that many are already
lost in seeking,

08:54.676 --> 09:03.765
but there are so many who have now come
to the right path and to the right ascent.

09:03.966 --> 09:08.615
The another thing this Mahalakshmi
principle does is to allow

09:08.816 --> 09:14.345
the Kundalini’s power to go to different
chakras also,

09:14.546 --> 09:19.433
to make a way to different chakras and
corrects all the chakras.

09:19.634 --> 09:23.329
She is a very flexible force, I should say,

09:23.530 --> 09:27.812
which guides the Kundalini into different
chakras

09:28.013 --> 09:33.082
and She understands which chakra needs
the help of the Kundalini.

09:33.283 --> 09:38.008
So you must have seen that when
the Kundalini rises how She pulsates,

09:38.209 --> 09:45.286
where She goes, where She shows the need
is of your awakening.

09:45.674 --> 09:52.796
All this works out because She is full
of compassion

09:52.997 --> 09:59.574
and love that you should get your absolute
truth.

09:59.775 --> 10:03.265
We have many problems as it is, you know,

10:03.466 --> 10:06.624
in Sahaja Yoga because when people
are ascending

10:06.825 --> 10:14.817
they carry on with them some of their
past stones and they cannot climb.

10:15.018 --> 10:20.845
They try then they fall, they try then they
fall, then they go up again, they fall.

10:21.046 --> 10:29.285
But today I’m going to tell you about what
is the state one has to achieve.

10:30.476 --> 10:35.168
As Shri Krishna has said it in the “Gita,”

10:35.369 --> 10:38.881
describes Stitha Pragya, the second
chapter,

10:39.082 --> 10:43.427
but it’s very difficult to understand Him,
He is not so clear cut as your Mother is.

10:43.628 --> 10:48.721
So people don’t understand what He is
saying. (Aside: “Can you close the...?”)

10:54.989 --> 11:00.854
And they ask the question, “How, how do you
reach that state of Stitha Pragya?

11:01.055 --> 11:05.047
How do you get to that stage?”

11:05.248 --> 11:08.158
But Gyaneshwara, when he wrote
his “Gyaneshwari,”

11:08.359 --> 11:15.731
he called it as the Sahaja Stithi, means
the state of Sahaj.

11:16.723 --> 11:22.748
He didn’t call Stitha Pragya. He called it
as Sahaja Stithi,

11:22.949 --> 11:29.417
meaning the state of Sahaj.

11:29.618 --> 11:35.415
So he describes the Sahaj in a very
beautiful manner and very subtle.

11:35.615 --> 11:40.639
Of course, Gyaneshwara also, very few
people understand, I think.

11:42.059 --> 11:49.665
A person who reaches that state is like
a mirror

11:49.951 --> 11:56.711
and so many faces pass over that mirror,
so many look into that mirror,

11:56.912 --> 12:06.235
so many decorate in front of the mirror,
but mirror is the same as it is.

12:06.436 --> 12:12.051
So the person who is a Stitha Pragya
or the person who is Sahaja

12:12.252 --> 12:21.196
is not bothered about what is facing him,
who is facing whom, where he is.

12:21.397 --> 12:28.346
He stays within himself. He contains
within himself.

12:28.547 --> 12:37.206
Like the sun. If the sun plays with
his different rays,

12:37.407 --> 12:42.007
he is not lost. All the rays again return
to him.

12:42.208 --> 12:52.330
In the same way, all the senses that we
have, all the senses

12:52.531 --> 13:00.451
that are there do play around, but for
a person who is in a Sahaja state

13:00.652 --> 13:05.203
it doesn’t matter, it makes no difference.
He’s not involved. He just plays around.

13:05.404 --> 13:12.346
Again, all of them come back to him.
This is a state you all have to achieve.

13:12.547 --> 13:16.930
Then you are really Sahaja Yogis.
But I still find people lost,

13:17.131 --> 13:22.853
getting money out of Sahaja Yoga, some
people lost getting out of leaderships,

13:23.054 --> 13:28.708
some are lost in getting jealousies
and envies and all that.

13:28.909 --> 13:33.828
So that means a lot of work has to be done,
still, within.

13:34.029 --> 13:39.468
There is no need to work as such if you
leave everything.

13:39.669 --> 13:43.171
That’s why I always say meditate, because
when you meditate,

13:43.372 --> 13:51.266
what happens, that all these things that
are pulling you down are finished.

13:51.467 --> 13:56.440
Gradually they disappear because you
become your Self.

13:56.641 --> 14:00.665
You get contained by yourself and you are
never bored.

14:00.865 --> 14:04.091
I am never bored. I don’t know what
boring word means, you see.

14:04.292 --> 14:09.732
When it is with you or alone, I never get
bored. What is there to get bored?

14:09.933 --> 14:14.522
If you are not involved into anything
you never get bored.

14:14.723 --> 14:19.957
Another thing is you rise above all these
things, like greed.

14:20.158 --> 14:24.192
Now people who are greedy are still
involved making money here,

14:24.393 --> 14:29.118
making money there, all that thing.
Those people who are still full of lust

14:29.319 --> 14:34.782
are still making, organizing, some things
like that.

14:34.983 --> 14:40.931
But in a Sahaj Stithi you just watch.
You are just a witness.

14:41.132 --> 14:47.423
You are not lost into anything that is
pulling you down.

14:47.624 --> 14:51.857
This state is not difficult to achieve
for you, at all,

14:52.058 --> 14:54.914
because you have crossed over your mind.

14:55.115 --> 14:58.990
Now all these things come to you through
your mind.

14:59.191 --> 15:04.599
I’ve already said that mind is a myth,
which you must accept.

15:04.800 --> 15:08.774
Myth is that this mind gives you ideas.

15:08.975 --> 15:12.488
Some people think, “Yes Mother, but -
yes Mother, but - .”

15:12.689 --> 15:17.987
This “but” is coming from your brain,
from your mind.

15:18.188 --> 15:23.779
The brain is reality, but not the mind.
The mind says “but”

15:23.980 --> 15:28.306
and then you start feeling very depressed
sometimes, unhappy,

15:28.507 --> 15:32.373
because some people feel even bad because
they are very good people,

15:32.574 --> 15:37.168
that there are so few Sahaja Yogis.
Doesn’t matter.

15:38.146 --> 15:45.142
Just watch and this watching state, this
witness state is the Sahaja Stithi.

15:45.343 --> 15:49.623
In that you become so subtle, you become
your Self,

15:49.823 --> 15:56.050
meaning so subtle that nothing can disturb
you, nothing can change you.

15:56.251 --> 16:02.986
Now see the nature as it is. You know
there are ninety-two elements

16:03.187 --> 16:06.618
and ninety-two elements, none of them
can be...

16:06.819 --> 16:16.150
say for example, you cannot make silver
into gold. Gold into silver.

16:16.351 --> 16:21.999
The atoms are so arranged that they have
certain valencies

16:22.200 --> 16:26.326
and apart from atom, even molecules
are so arranged

16:26.527 --> 16:30.792
that they have their own structure.
You cannot change.

16:30.993 --> 16:33.608
If you try to change then you will create
bombs,

16:33.816 --> 16:38.437
atomic bomb, this bomb. It’s absolutely
destructive.

16:38.638 --> 16:42.666
It’s only human beings who can change,
who can transform.

16:42.867 --> 16:48.932
Now look at the blessings that you are
a human being and you can be transformed

16:49.133 --> 16:55.526
and you can be made into a new element
that is the Self.

16:55.727 --> 16:58.385
This is the specialty of human beings.

16:58.586 --> 17:01.366
But if somebody there is a false guru
or somebody,

17:01.567 --> 17:04.575
he tries to do something, you’ll explode.

17:04.776 --> 17:09.312
I have seen people who have been to false
gurus, they still faint,

17:09.513 --> 17:13.382
they still have problems, they still get
troubled

17:13.583 --> 17:18.628
more than people who have been without
them.

17:18.829 --> 17:21.697
They are also all right now, much of them
are improved;

17:21.898 --> 17:28.390
but this is one thing one should
understand, that in one way

17:28.591 --> 17:32.778
when you are analyzing and when you are
breaking an atom

17:32.979 --> 17:38.113
or you are breaking a molecule and trying
to transform,

17:38.314 --> 17:43.277
it explodes. It doesn’t work out.

17:43.478 --> 17:48.470
The other way round is that when you
try to synthesize,

17:48.671 --> 17:51.689
then you can form anything in the nature.

17:51.890 --> 17:55.681
Like, this has now been brought out
by synthesizing,

17:55.882 --> 18:00.015
this plastic is created by synthesizing.

18:00.216 --> 18:05.171
Matter can be synthesized and can be
brought together

18:05.372 --> 18:11.202
and human beings have to get synthesized
also.

18:11.403 --> 18:20.162
They can be synthesized better than matter
because they change, they transform.

18:20.363 --> 18:29.329
Now say example, there is gold. You make
gold into ornaments, make into anything.

18:29.530 --> 18:37.721
It remains all the time, all the time gold.
Gold is gold. It is there.

18:37.922 --> 18:42.230
It is not that by changing them into
ornaments it changes.

18:42.431 --> 18:45.022
Its element is there. Gold is there.

18:45.223 --> 18:49.831
But for human beings they get transformed
when they are synthesized.

18:50.032 --> 18:59.329
This is a very big difference between the
matter and the nature and human beings.

18:59.530 --> 19:05.795
Matter, nature are different absolutely
from human beings.

19:05.996 --> 19:13.255
Human beings, once they are transformed,
it’s like a living process.

19:13.456 --> 19:20.366
They become like flowers but still it is
not that you see in the nature.

19:20.567 --> 19:26.868
It’s not the same as you see in the nature
because nature doesn’t have a mind.

19:27.069 --> 19:33.822
It doesn’t have a mind. It just is under
the control

19:34.023 --> 19:38.605
of the Divine or nature that it’s working
out that way.

19:38.806 --> 19:43.962
But here you are under your own control.

19:45.073 --> 19:48.924
Here you can control yourself.

19:49.125 --> 19:54.503
In this synthesis which is growing inside
you what you find,

19:54.704 --> 19:59.006
that you are completely in control
of yourself.

19:59.207 --> 20:02.183
You know what is happening to you.

20:02.384 --> 20:07.525
Now you start seeing yourself separating
from all these things.

20:07.726 --> 20:13.320
Some people come and tell Me, “Mother, see,
my ego is very bad, you just take it out.”

20:13.520 --> 20:17.866
He sees his ego, he sees what is
the problem is.

20:18.067 --> 20:22.288
Somebody says, “Mother, my Nabhi is
very bad,I’m still busy with the money.”

20:22.489 --> 20:29.105
He sees it. First starts the knowledge
about yourself,

20:29.306 --> 20:36.194
we call as self-knowledge. But one has
to even go beyond self-knowledge.

20:36.395 --> 20:40.635
By that knowledge, what do you do,
we have to see.

20:43.023 --> 20:48.764
When you have the knowledge, first we say
there’s no knowledge,

20:48.965 --> 20:52.213
people have no knowledge, they are
ignorant, there’s darkness, all that.

20:52.390 --> 20:58.770
Now the light has come, you can see.
You can know what’s wrong with you.

20:58.971 --> 21:05.416
Now you start separating yourself from all
those things that you see as wrong with you.

21:05.617 --> 21:11.006
You see them getting out. So many
nonsensical things there are.

21:11.207 --> 21:15.904
Like, we have jealousies, envy, greed
and lust.

21:16.105 --> 21:20.257
I mean, it’s horrible things to say
on a Diwali function, see.

21:20.458 --> 21:27.267
So the Diwali is that one by one so many
lights are enlightened

21:27.467 --> 21:30.304
and you start seeing it first.

21:30.505 --> 21:34.315
First you start seeing what is wrong
within you,

21:34.517 --> 21:38.074
and then as you see it, you don’t want it.

21:38.275 --> 21:45.698
Then you work out to get rid of it,
to become clean.

21:45.899 --> 21:50.512
Now this also knowledge disappears.

21:50.713 --> 21:57.457
You don’t have to have any knowledge.
You are there. You are there.

21:57.658 --> 22:02.486
There is no need to know about your
chakras, you are just there.

22:02.687 --> 22:06.638
At that stage nothing matters.

22:06.839 --> 22:11.282
You become just like a stone, I can say.

22:11.483 --> 22:18.027
Stone with a brain intact and a heart
intact and a liver intact.

22:18.228 --> 22:23.206
You just don’t mind anything, don’t get
upset with anything.

22:23.407 --> 22:32.050
You just enjoy the love and compassion
that’s flowing.

22:32.251 --> 22:37.006
And the ripples that come back to you,
even that is lost after some time

22:37.207 --> 22:41.356
and you are just nothing but Sahaj.

22:42.205 --> 22:47.350
That is the state people achieved. In those
days they achieved this state.

22:47.550 --> 22:50.658
But with that, what lacking happened,
that they’d get lost.

22:50.859 --> 22:54.600
They all got lost. They couldn’t do
anything to others.

22:54.800 --> 23:00.307
One person getting it, becoming great,
finished. Or two persons at the most.

23:00.508 --> 23:04.287
So now Sahaja Yoga stands, first of all,

23:04.488 --> 23:08.686
at the knowledge state, where you have
the knowledge.

23:08.887 --> 23:13.568
First, you should first of all have full
knowledge about yourself.

23:13.769 --> 23:17.090
The self-knowledge should be complete.

23:17.291 --> 23:21.635
Then in the third stage we should say
that when the knowledge is full

23:21.836 --> 23:26.891
you should get rid of all those things
that you know about yourself,

23:27.092 --> 23:31.562
which are useless, which are hampering
your progress, which you know is wrong.

23:31.763 --> 23:37.310
Like, I see some dirt falling on my sari,
I’ll just clean it out like that.

23:37.511 --> 23:43.072
Then you start separating yourself
into that Sahaja state.

23:43.273 --> 23:49.258
But still in Sahaja Yoga you develop
another dimension

23:49.496 --> 23:56.379
which is collective consciousness. That is
the modern Sahaja Yoga.

23:56.580 --> 24:02.313
In the olden days they didn’t have this,
so they just all got lost.

24:02.514 --> 24:07.744
Now you have collective consciousness
and in that collective consciousness

24:07.945 --> 24:13.222
you start feeling others, feeling
for others, compassion for others

24:13.423 --> 24:19.871
and you start working out for others.
In that also, sometimes, you know,

24:20.072 --> 24:23.151
when you are working around, you think,
"How much money I can make?

24:23.352 --> 24:29.953
What I can achieve as a leader?" -
or some sort of thing is still there.

24:30.154 --> 24:33.981
But this collective consciousness starts
growing.

24:34.182 --> 24:37.450
When it starts growing, then you become
as I said,

24:37.651 --> 24:42.723
drop in the ocean, means complete ocean,
you become.

24:43.869 --> 24:51.151
You become complete ocean. So the ocean
has its own mariadas. It doesn’t bother.

24:51.352 --> 24:54.849
It has to live with its mariadas, it lives
with its mariadas.

24:55.049 --> 24:57.796
It doesn’t want to cross any boundaries,
all right.

24:57.997 --> 25:01.789
Accept it. It will not cross its
boundaries.

25:01.990 --> 25:06.663
In the same way it happens that you are
very self-contained.

25:06.864 --> 25:11.946
You are not selfish, but you become
very self-contained.

25:12.147 --> 25:15.891
You are contained within yourself.

25:16.092 --> 25:20.699
I know many Sahaja Yogis are angry that
I have not punished many horrible people

25:20.900 --> 25:24.972
who have been troubling Sahaja Yoga.
I don’t have to bother.

25:25.173 --> 25:28.177
There’s Paramchaitanya which is doing
a lot of work.

25:28.378 --> 25:32.971
Let it look after it. Why should I bother
about anyone?

25:33.172 --> 25:38.319
You see, after all, things are working out
so why to interfere?

25:39.216 --> 25:47.996
My job is just to watch, just to see.
That’s sufficient.

25:48.197 --> 25:54.639
There’s no need for Me to kill anybody
in this lifetime or to destroy.

25:54.840 --> 25:59.072
They are destroyed by themselves.
I have told you that

25:59.273 --> 26:03.641
I need not expose people, but whichever
country I go,

26:03.842 --> 26:07.501
I find people get exposed. I run away
from there, really, sometimes,

26:07.702 --> 26:11.402
thinking, "God knows what more is going
to come."

26:11.603 --> 26:17.382
Even little attention on any country,
it just works out.

26:17.583 --> 26:23.090
Even without My knowledge, “Oh My God,”
I said, “When did I do that?”

26:23.291 --> 26:31.894
So one has to become, of course, he becomes
the power of Divine love, no doubt.

26:32.095 --> 26:37.599
He becomes the power of Divine love,
but he doesn’t handle it.

26:37.800 --> 26:40.731
Left to this Divine power which is working,

26:40.932 --> 26:46.862
which is also separated from Me, you’ll be
surprised. I am alone.

26:47.063 --> 26:52.236
Absolutely alone. Even this power is
separated from Me,

26:52.437 --> 26:56.334
but this power knows what is good for
human beings,

26:56.535 --> 27:00.372
what is good for Sahaja Yoga. It works
on its own.

27:00.573 --> 27:05.332
I don’t interfere. It’s a reflex action,
believe Me, it’s a reflex action.

27:05.533 --> 27:09.979
Maybe you might say, “Mother, you have
made it.” All right, whatever it is,

27:10.180 --> 27:15.558
but I don’t interfere with it. I don’t have
to tell anything to it.

27:15.759 --> 27:18.786
It just works and it’s working so well.

27:18.987 --> 27:22.552
I’ll give you an example. Once in England
long time back,

27:22.753 --> 27:24.682
they said, “Mother, we want to have
a very long summer.”

27:24.883 --> 27:26.779
I said, “Why do you want to ask such
things?”

27:26.980 --> 27:30.951
“No, no, Mother, we must have a long
summer, a very long summer, very - “

27:31.152 --> 27:38.661
Three or four times they said it and it was
a very long, horrible summer in London.

27:38.862 --> 27:42.583
And it’s not like India where we have
air conditioning, fans,

27:42.784 --> 27:47.078
something we have, at least hand fans.
There was nothing there.

27:47.279 --> 27:50.845
So we didn’t know. We had a little gallery,
we used to sleep in that.

27:51.046 --> 27:59.092
So we went to the shop in England and
we asked in London City, for a fan.

27:59.261 --> 28:03.141
So they said, “All right, after three
months. You order us.”

28:03.342 --> 28:07.466
After three months when it will be very
cold they will give us the fan.

28:07.667 --> 28:12.884
We said, “We don’t want any fans.”
So My daughter sent two fans by plane.

28:13.085 --> 28:16.282
And that’s how we managed. You see,
Indians, we feel very hot

28:16.483 --> 28:19.167
because we have had a lot of sun
in our country,

28:19.368 --> 28:22.684
we feel much hotter than any one of you.
The way you sit in the sun,

28:22.885 --> 28:26.728
you know, we can’t understand.
You know, in India they used to say,

28:26.929 --> 28:31.464
"An Englishman and a mad dog can only
go in the sun."

28:31.665 --> 28:34.971
So our situation is like that,

28:35.172 --> 28:38.086
that we cannot go in the sun because we
have had too much.

28:38.324 --> 28:43.307
And this summer, you see, was so
tremendous, so tremendous

28:43.508 --> 28:50.230
that after that one thing good happened.
That ochre color appeared on the leaves

28:50.431 --> 28:54.535
and then gradually the red and all that
of the autumn season

28:54.736 --> 28:59.135
was best at that time and then one Sahaja
Yogi dreamt that,

28:59.336 --> 29:03.040
“Mother asked me to drive in Her
back yard.”

29:03.241 --> 29:09.600
So he told everybody that, “Mother has been
asking me to drive in the back yard.”

29:09.800 --> 29:13.234
So I telephoned to him, I didn’t know
he had dreamt like that,

29:13.472 --> 29:17.866
that, “Can you come along for a while,
I want to go and see this autumn

29:18.067 --> 29:23.013
all over England.” So he came and we were
driving, miles together

29:23.214 --> 29:27.906
and then they told Me, “Mother, it was so,
he told us that that was My back yard.”

29:28.107 --> 29:32.317
Can you imagine that he was driving
for miles together, beautiful,

29:32.531 --> 29:38.472
just like Canada, the whole England
was filled with the beauty of autumn.

29:38.673 --> 29:43.891
So even if there’s something like that
happens, it is compensated.

29:44.053 --> 29:49.731
It is compensated and so beautiful it was,
all the people were out in the autumn

29:49.932 --> 29:54.734
to see the beautiful colors of the nature,
of different greenery,

29:54.935 --> 29:59.264
yellow, ochre, all kinds of colors were
there.

29:59.465 --> 30:03.037
Surprisingly, in that country you never
see all that.

30:03.238 --> 30:08.837
And because of the sun shining so bright,
it was compensated.

30:09.038 --> 30:16.606
It was compensated by this Paramchaitanya.
So the Paramchaitanya is looking after this.

30:16.807 --> 30:23.419
All these things are managed by
Paramchaitanya. I am doing nothing.

30:23.620 --> 30:27.190
I am Nishkriya. I’m just sitting down
and watching.

30:27.391 --> 30:32.142
To Me nothing matters. You see,
it’s working out slowly and steadily.

30:32.343 --> 30:34.971
Ha, if you tell Me something supposing,
they said,

30:35.172 --> 30:37.932
“Mother, we prayed to You and it happened.”
All right, maybe,

30:38.133 --> 30:43.225
these people must have heard, around Me.
Not me, you see,

30:43.426 --> 30:49.875
and they must have done the job and for
that I’m not responsible, in no way.

30:50.076 --> 30:55.275
Like one lady in Mexico had a son, was
very sick and was about to die.

30:55.476 --> 30:58.557
She wrote a letter to Me, three letters
she wrote

30:58.758 --> 31:03.568
that, “My son is going to die, he’s a young
fellow, studying in Harvard.”

31:03.769 --> 31:06.550
I didn’t do anything. I never wrote to her.

31:06.751 --> 31:10.180
Fourth letter came that he’s completely
cured. Now I didn’t do that

31:10.381 --> 31:14.592
because I was just sitting in one place
and how is it, it has worked out?

31:14.793 --> 31:19.786
So everything, you see, you think I do
is not done by Me.

31:19.987 --> 31:24.931
Is done by this Paramchaitanya. Because
I’m also separated from you, completely,

31:25.132 --> 31:29.563
absolutely separated. So they say,
“You pray, now.” You can pray.

31:29.764 --> 31:32.647
If you pray, you pray to these deities
that are around,

31:32.848 --> 31:36.572
you pray to all these ganas and all that,
not to Me.

31:36.773 --> 31:39.349
Because I have nothing to do with it.

31:39.550 --> 31:43.016
You see, they don’t tell Me that I have
to do this or I have to do that.

31:43.217 --> 31:46.941
So why should I tell them do this
or do that? It is like that.

31:47.142 --> 31:51.318
And in that state only we can say you are
in a Sahaja state,

31:51.519 --> 31:54.592
where you don’t desire anything, you don’t
want anything.

31:54.793 --> 31:59.695
I do everything. All kinds of things,
I am doing. Like the sun is doing,

31:59.896 --> 32:07.725
I am also doing in the sense that I’m
looking after things, flowers, this that.

32:07.925 --> 32:13.012
I am also receiving presents from you,
I’m receiving this from you

32:13.213 --> 32:17.321
and then see, I don’t receive anything.

32:17.522 --> 32:21.635
I don’t have anything. I have no
interest in it.

32:21.836 --> 32:24.489
But you want to give for your joy,
all right, have it.

32:24.690 --> 32:27.189
You want to put flowers, all right, you can
have flowers.

32:27.390 --> 32:32.683
Even if there’s flowers or not makes no
difference to Me as a person, I’m saying.

32:32.884 --> 32:38.960
But as Your Mother I love you.
All of you I love.

32:39.214 --> 32:42.206
But I don’t do anything as such to love
you. And everybody says,

32:42.407 --> 32:47.140
“Mother, You love us so much.” When? When
did I love you? I never even kissed you.

32:47.341 --> 32:51.124
But you always say I love you very much.
So what is this?

32:51.325 --> 32:56.987
Who is working it out, this? Is something
which is not Me, beyond Me.

32:57.188 --> 33:01.822
This is the state in which, once we rise,
we call it as Sahaja Stithi.

33:02.023 --> 33:07.375
In the Sahaja Stithi you think you are
doing nothing. Everything is working out.

33:07.576 --> 33:11.501
But at this stage if I tell you, you say,
“Oh, we are not doing anything.

33:11.723 --> 33:15.455
Why should we spread Sahaja Yoga?
It’s not our job.”

33:15.656 --> 33:20.177
Just now, that’s not your stithi,
that’s why.

33:20.378 --> 33:23.367
So you have to rise up to that state.

33:23.568 --> 33:29.268
That’s only possible when you are
in the knowledge state,

33:29.469 --> 33:32.609
where you have self-knowledge, the knowledge
of the whole world.

33:32.836 --> 33:36.398
But if you go beyond knowledge then you
must have seen many a times,

33:36.599 --> 33:42.076
I just say something. I just say something
and it is there.

33:42.277 --> 33:45.425
I never feel vibrations of anyone
or anything.

33:45.626 --> 33:48.931
I don’t feel My Kundalini, either nor
any chakras, nothing,

33:49.132 --> 33:52.633
but I know, know automatically like
a computer.

33:52.834 --> 33:58.063
But that computer also I am not. Just it’s
trouble, it’s difficult to explain to you

33:58.264 --> 34:01.700
what is this stithi is because you have
to achieve it.

34:01.901 --> 34:06.386
Once you achieve it then you are
in a very subtle state

34:06.587 --> 34:15.432
and that subtle state is nothing but bliss.
But that bliss also you cannot enjoy.

34:15.662 --> 34:23.073
I don’t know how to enjoy everything.
Supposing now you say, “Jai Mataji.”

34:23.274 --> 34:29.215
I forget even you are calling Me.
I also say, “Jai Mataji,” finished.

34:29.416 --> 34:34.058
See it is such a simple thing one has
to understand

34:34.258 --> 34:37.728
that the state in which one has to rise

34:37.929 --> 34:42.049
is a state where without doing anything,
everything works out.

34:42.250 --> 34:45.546
If that is your state, all right. But it’s
not so.

34:45.747 --> 34:50.523
So you have to rise up to that state
by doing. First you have to do it.

34:50.724 --> 34:57.397
First you have to know and then knowledge
has no need, you don’t have to know,

34:57.598 --> 35:01.925
but first that has to be worked out
and brought to that level.

35:02.140 --> 35:07.019
Now Diwali has the significance that
on Diwali day, what we do,

35:07.220 --> 35:15.137
we put lights all over. So that we put
Sahaja Yoga everywhere.

35:15.338 --> 35:19.946
But does the light know about itself?

35:23.136 --> 35:31.712
Does the candle knows about itself? She
enlightens everything but she doesn’t know.

35:34.506 --> 35:41.370
Like the moon, which is giving moonlight,
does it know itself?

35:41.571 --> 35:46.242
Does he enjoy? Nothing.

35:47.646 --> 35:51.700
In the same way it happens that
on a Diwali day you are,

35:51.901 --> 35:55.505
what you are doing is enlightening people,
you are enlightening them,

35:55.706 --> 36:00.828
you are doing all this for them,
it’s a good idea. You must do it.

36:01.029 --> 36:07.447
But also know that you have to become the
lamp yourself which doesn’t know yourself.

36:08.701 --> 36:14.063
So there are two messages. The first one is
that we have to enlighten the world,

36:14.264 --> 36:17.130
we have to enlighten others. This is
the first one.

36:17.331 --> 36:25.243
Then we have to become that which is the
light itself and light itself doesn’t know.

36:25.444 --> 36:28.749
Yesterday you were singing, “You are
the light,” you are this thing.

36:28.950 --> 36:36.300
All right, so what? I was just saying,
‘Yes, I am the light, I don’t know Myself.”

36:36.501 --> 36:40.220
That’s the state where you don’t know
you are the light.

36:40.421 --> 36:43.454
You just don’t know that. It doesn’t come
into your head.

36:43.655 --> 36:47.722
Even so many times you have sung, you have
said thousand names there are, everything,

36:47.923 --> 36:53.949
but it doesn’t come into My head that
this is Me you are talking about.

36:54.306 --> 36:58.240
Now when I say this I don’t know how
you will react.

36:58.441 --> 37:02.869
Because human beings are queer birds,
you see. You tell them something.

37:03.070 --> 37:09.828
Maybe that your ego might come up and you
say, “Yes, yes, I am also just the same.”

37:10.029 --> 37:13.606
There are many, many who came like
that, that, “I am higher than Mataji.”

37:13.807 --> 37:20.832
Ba, ba maybe, I don’t know. There are
many who said that, “I am Kalki.”

37:21.033 --> 37:25.245
Nowadays there’s one fellow going round
saying, “I am Kalki, I am this, I am that.”

37:25.446 --> 37:30.869
All right, doesn’t matter. You be that,
very good idea.

37:41.386 --> 37:49.814
But if I say I am Adi Shakti that means
I don’t know what I am, really.

37:50.015 --> 37:52.776
I had to say because people said,
“Mother, you have to declare.”

37:52.977 --> 37:57.189
Declare what? Whatever I am, that I am.

37:57.390 --> 38:01.728
Now I find by declaration you people
started

38:01.929 --> 38:05.500
growing more, so all right, have it
that way.

38:05.701 --> 38:11.253
But there is no need for anyone to declare
anything or to say anything.

38:11.454 --> 38:18.839
That is the state one has to achieve.
But to get to that state you have to work.

38:19.040 --> 38:25.153
And work is to spread Sahaja Yoga.
You have to enlighten many lights.

38:25.354 --> 38:30.368
That means you will realize that you are
the light which is enlightening all that,

38:30.569 --> 38:36.254
and then in a subtle way you will realize
that, “I am the light.”

38:36.455 --> 38:40.863
Many Sahaja Yogis are doing a lot of work
and working it out,

38:41.064 --> 38:45.794
spreading Sahaja Yoga. It’s a very great
thing that has happened.

38:45.995 --> 38:48.855
In so many countries, the way it has
spread,

38:49.056 --> 38:54.324
it has removed the darkness of religion
which was outside.

38:54.525 --> 39:02.917
It was darkness of so many - racialism,
thisism, thatism, all it has removed.

39:03.118 --> 39:10.418
So this has worked out, the cleansing.
For you to have the clean water to swim.

39:10.619 --> 39:17.323
Once you start doing that then you realize
gradually

39:17.524 --> 39:24.462
that now the sea is clean, we just watch,
we just see how it is working.

39:24.663 --> 39:28.519
I hope in your lifetime only, you achieve
this state

39:28.720 --> 39:36.914
where you achieve your complete work
of self-realization to others.

39:37.115 --> 39:41.133
Those who do not give self-realization
to others, who just come for the pujas,

39:41.334 --> 39:45.712
this thing, are mediocres. They cannot
rise very high.

39:45.913 --> 39:49.278
This coming to puja is what, like, you just
rise higher with the puja

39:49.479 --> 39:53.345
then again you go down. But those
who steadily grow

39:53.546 --> 39:57.491
will grow into this state, I am sure,
in My lifetime

39:57.692 --> 40:02.189
I should be able to see such people
who are such that if they stand here

40:02.390 --> 40:07.531
they emit peace, they emit light, they emit
everything. Because they are the light.

40:07.732 --> 40:11.005
They don’t have to enlighten, but they
are the light.

40:11.206 --> 40:16.726
Such a stage has to be developed
and to be worked out within yourself.

40:16.927 --> 40:20.336
And this state has been described
by so many poets,

40:20.537 --> 40:24.709
so many saints and everything, but they
were at that stage

40:24.910 --> 40:27.913
and people thought, what is this they
are talking? They thought they were mad.

40:28.114 --> 40:30.555
Even for Christ, they thought He is to be
crucified,

40:30.756 --> 40:34.815
because they couldn’t understand it.
Now you are gradually growing

40:35.016 --> 40:39.573
one by one, step by step, step by step,
so now you understand this.

40:39.774 --> 40:42.332
You understand Christ, you understand
all these people

40:42.533 --> 40:46.391
and at this stage you have still to work.

40:46.592 --> 40:49.976
Those who do not work for Sahaja Yoga
cannot rise higher.

40:50.177 --> 40:54.841
You have to work for Sahaja Yoga, you have
to spread it more,

40:55.042 --> 41:00.038
you have to work it out, enjoy each other,
this brotherhood, everything.

41:00.244 --> 41:08.161
All the qualities of a beautiful
personality should be there.

41:08.362 --> 41:15.900
Unless and until you achieve that state,
then you can only rise higher to that stage

41:16.101 --> 41:20.979
which I am describing is a Sahaja Stithi.
In that state you will be perfect.

41:21.180 --> 41:28.494
But you must get rid of all these things
and today is a day, also of Mahalakshmi.

41:28.732 --> 41:33.129
The first thing is, I think, this madness
about money.

41:33.330 --> 41:37.063
This should be understood that it’s
real madness.

41:37.264 --> 41:40.103
Those who are rich have no money.
You ask a rich man, he’ll say,

41:40.304 --> 41:45.224
“Oh, I have no money.” Why? What is this
all this? This is no money.

41:45.425 --> 41:49.292
You ask the poor man, he has no money.
A rich man has no money.

41:49.493 --> 41:56.744
So it’s a kind of a greed which is never
satisfied, which never helps you.

41:56.945 --> 42:01.844
All these little, little things have
to first drop out.

42:02.045 --> 42:04.801
Then your work should cleanse you.
In your work you will know

42:05.002 --> 42:07.639
whether you are cleansing or not.
In the work you will know

42:07.840 --> 42:14.095
how you are doing your work. Once that
is done, then I think I am sure

42:14.296 --> 42:19.663
some of you will achieve that state
in My lifetime, in your lifetime.

42:19.864 --> 42:23.257
That’s what I want today to tell you,
on a Diwali day,

42:23.458 --> 42:28.158
that we have to become subtler and subtler
and subtler.

42:28.359 --> 42:32.322
We should not be influenced by outside
things.

42:32.759 --> 42:39.439
Like, the outside thing is that, some sort
of a fashion starts.

42:39.640 --> 42:45.892
People who follow fashions are stupid.
They are like blind mices.

42:46.093 --> 42:50.531
Anybody can lead them into anything,
now do this, they do it. That, they do it.

42:50.732 --> 42:55.628
So if you try to follow any kind
of a thought

42:55.829 --> 42:58.841
which is given to us by somebody else,

42:59.042 --> 43:03.054
in that thought you’ll completely lose
yourself and you'll become,

43:03.255 --> 43:10.551
"I am this, I am Christian, I am Hindu,
I am Muslim, I am Muss leman." Stupidity.

43:10.820 --> 43:19.361
You are your Self. You are the Spirit.
And when you become the Spirit

43:19.562 --> 43:24.875
then you start knowing so much and that
knowledge is very important.

43:25.076 --> 43:30.717
This is the gap between a saint and
a normal human being,

43:30.918 --> 43:34.227
which you have crossed gradually so you
know what are the problems

43:34.428 --> 43:37.774
of the human beings are and dealing
with human beings,

43:37.975 --> 43:41.293
you know how to deal with them.

43:41.531 --> 43:46.251
In Sahaja Yoga only the collective
consciousness, in modern times, has come.

43:46.452 --> 43:52.746
This collective consciousness, also
the saints had, but they would not say.

43:52.947 --> 43:57.213
They would not say anything. They would
not bother.

43:57.414 --> 44:02.059
All right, this fellow has this chakra,
let him go to hell. Doesn’t care.

44:02.260 --> 44:05.286
It’s not a question of not caring, but
not bothered.

44:05.487 --> 44:10.254
They were sitting in a state which
was just recording, all right.

44:10.455 --> 44:13.670
An ugly man goes before the mirror,
all right,

44:13.871 --> 44:17.775
if a beautiful person goes before
the mirror is all right.

44:17.976 --> 44:25.101
In the same way these people start
allowing people to pass through

44:25.302 --> 44:28.167
but we have to understand, still we
have to grow.

44:28.368 --> 44:31.863
We have to still grow by working it out.

44:32.064 --> 44:38.050
Those people who are working it out
and spreading it all over

44:38.251 --> 44:43.599
are the ones which are really very
much there

44:43.800 --> 44:53.439
and to them, I must say, the Paramchaitanya
is just their servant.

44:53.640 --> 44:59.517
I have seen people who desire something,
it works out.

44:59.718 --> 45:02.761
They ask for something, it works out.

45:02.931 --> 45:06.563
For that, now, what should we have,
is the point.

45:06.764 --> 45:11.878
After getting realization, after getting
everything, what should we have

45:12.079 --> 45:17.908
that we develop is the faith.
Faith in yourself.

45:18.109 --> 45:24.508
Faith in that you are the Spirit,

45:24.709 --> 45:30.507
that you have the light and you have
to enlighten others.

45:32.721 --> 45:37.016
This faith when it grows deeper and
deeper then you think,

45:37.216 --> 45:42.805
"Oh, what I am? I am the Spirit."

45:43.006 --> 45:48.317
If you are the Spirit then this whole
nature is with you.

45:48.518 --> 45:55.126
I know of some Sahaja Yogis. One of them
was a fisherman.

45:55.327 --> 45:59.520
He was doing Sahaja Yoga work. He has
tremendous faith in Me

45:59.721 --> 46:05.773
and somehow he was going to another
village to do Sahaja Yoga work.

46:05.974 --> 46:14.060
When he came out of his little hut he found
it’s all full of clouds, black clouds.

46:14.261 --> 46:17.197
So he raised his hand and said, “See now,
I’m going for Mother’s work.

46:17.383 --> 46:22.392
And you dare not start raining. You keep
as you are, hanging there

46:22.593 --> 46:26.948
till I finish my work,” you see. Because
he was going by boat.

46:27.149 --> 46:30.561
And other Sahaja Yogis thought,
“What is he talking about?”

46:30.762 --> 46:34.041
They all got into the boat, they reached
the other village.

46:34.242 --> 46:37.803
They gave realization to others,
he finished his lecturing, everything,

46:38.004 --> 46:41.068
he came back on the shore and he entered
his house.

46:41.269 --> 46:47.062
When he was closing the door, “All right,
so go ahead,” he said. And he managed.

46:47.263 --> 46:52.624
So the complete faith that this
Paramchaitanya is like your servant,

46:52.825 --> 46:58.789
is all the time waiting there to serve you.
Whatever you say will happen.

46:58.990 --> 47:05.097
But first you must have complete faith
in yourself that you are a Sahaja Yogi.

47:05.298 --> 47:08.521
Even now I find, you see, people have
some lust,

47:08.722 --> 47:12.867
some sort of a horrible things in them.

47:13.068 --> 47:18.972
So first you must be established in Dharma.
Dharma, is, as you know, is righteousness.

47:19.173 --> 47:22.520
If you are in the righteousness, there’s
no question.

47:22.721 --> 47:26.079
There’s no question that this
Paramchaitanya won’t obey you.

47:26.280 --> 47:31.585
But supposing you want today something
and it doesn’t work out,

47:31.786 --> 47:36.068
then even to get disappointed itself
is not a very good thing.

47:36.269 --> 47:45.108
Disappointment also is a sign of your
immaturity.

47:45.309 --> 47:48.595
What is there to be disappointed?

47:50.321 --> 47:55.602
Maybe that that was good for you. Supposing
I lose My way.

47:55.803 --> 48:00.360
I’m going this way and I lose My way,
I don’t know where to go.

48:00.561 --> 48:05.007
So I get lost, it’s all right. What is
there? Wherever I am, I am there.

48:05.208 --> 48:08.388
How can I be lost to Myself? And then
what I find,

48:08.589 --> 48:12.809
that I had to go that way because I was
to meet somebody,

48:13.010 --> 48:16.860
I’ve been wanting to meet somebody and
meet that person there.

48:17.061 --> 48:21.041
Can you imagine? Such things happen
with Me,

48:21.242 --> 48:24.806
and even if I don’t meet, so what? I was
to go that side.

48:25.007 --> 48:28.176
I have to leave some vibrations, perhaps.
It’s like that.

48:28.377 --> 48:35.898
So once you know that whatever you are
doing in command, full command,

48:36.099 --> 48:43.087
full faith, actually the whole authority
comes to you through your faith

48:43.288 --> 48:47.975
which word is satta in Sanskrit, meaning
the truth.

48:48.176 --> 48:52.082
The truth gives you the authority. If you
have the truth with you,

48:52.283 --> 48:55.396
you have the absolute truth with you
then you have the authority

48:55.597 --> 49:02.826
and the authority is such that that
authorizes you, not others, but to you.

49:03.027 --> 49:07.244
This authority that you have works
and works.

49:07.445 --> 49:11.476
I've seen with simple Sahaja Yogis,
very simple uneducated also,

49:11.677 --> 49:16.777
are very powerful Sahaja Yogis, are very
powerful Sahaja Yogis.

49:16.978 --> 49:21.306
But they have one thing, is faith,
complete faith.

49:21.507 --> 49:27.221
Then another word in Sanskrit is titiksha,
means patience,

49:27.422 --> 49:32.967
saburi - patience. You must have patience.

49:33.168 --> 49:35.959
If you don't have patience, you want
immediately something to be done.

49:36.160 --> 49:38.717
How will you see the whole thing
working out?

49:38.926 --> 49:46.509
Many people are extremely jittery and
very fast-running.

49:46.710 --> 49:52.640
This world is running so fast and you are
the ones who have stood out

49:52.841 --> 49:56.263
and watching this rat race. You are not
one of them.

49:56.464 --> 50:00.682
So must have titiksha, means you must
have patience.

50:00.883 --> 50:05.285
So you must have faith in yourself fully
and also patience,

50:05.486 --> 50:11.464
how Sahaja Yoga is working out or how
this Paramchaitanya is working out.

50:11.665 --> 50:15.807
If it works this way, all right, that way,
all right. It is some meaning.

50:16.008 --> 50:22.402
If it works this way, there's some meaning.
If it is that way it has some meaning.

50:22.612 --> 50:31.793
Now the another thing which is important
is the faith in your guru.

50:31.994 --> 50:38.699
If you have faith in your guru,
Paramchaitanya is kind to you.

50:38.900 --> 50:44.380
It’s very helpful. But if you doubt, then
Paramchaitanya also doubts you

50:44.581 --> 50:47.932
because Paramchaitanya knows you through
your guru,

50:48.133 --> 50:53.069
whether it is Me or any other real guru,
it’s the same.

50:53.270 --> 50:57.179
But with Me, of course, because, you know,
I’m very forgiving

50:57.380 --> 51:03.293
so people start taking liberties. With
another guru, you see, he will beat them.

51:03.494 --> 51:07.937
He’ll do all kinds of horrible things
to you if you are not there.

51:08.138 --> 51:11.028
So I’ve told you many stories about
the gurus, how they treat -

51:11.229 --> 51:14.791
good gurus - their disciples.
But I forgive.

51:14.992 --> 51:17.857
I don’t say anything. Let it be,
it doesn’t matter.

51:18.058 --> 51:21.092
Because I think by leaving them alone only
they will rise

51:21.293 --> 51:23.428
and they will come up to this stage.

51:23.629 --> 51:27.801
But it happens sometimes that it may work
the other way round,

51:28.002 --> 51:36.710
that if they are forgiven, then they take
it for granted. It's all right.

51:36.911 --> 51:40.207
There is freedom, you can take it for
granted, you can do what you like.

51:40.408 --> 51:44.839
You can get lost, you can... I have nothing
to say.

51:45.389 --> 51:50.064
So the faith in yourself is with patience
you watch

51:50.273 --> 51:54.280
and do not get disappointed with anything
whatsoever.

51:54.481 --> 51:57.860
Now, just imagine so many people have got
realization,

51:58.061 --> 52:00.859
so many saints in this world, have you
seen?

52:01.060 --> 52:05.538
Yesterday I was surprised the way
the French were singing so well.

52:05.738 --> 52:08.322
You know, first time I had to take
a harmonium

52:08.523 --> 52:14.914
to teach them how to sing one line.
Half an hour I tried, I couldn’t do.

52:16.701 --> 52:21.437
The same French have reached that state
of creativity.

52:21.638 --> 52:26.847
You see, all your potential will rise.
It will express itself,

52:27.048 --> 52:30.915
but be careful not to get into ego
about it.

52:31.116 --> 52:35.678
Gradually it will flower and others
who are surrounding you

52:35.879 --> 52:39.471
will get the fragrance of it and they’ll
come to Sahaja Yoga.

52:39.672 --> 52:44.819
That is the blessing at that time,
the blessing of the real Divine will be

52:45.020 --> 52:51.982
that you’ll be raised to the state which we
call as a perfect, ‘purnatva’, complete.

52:52.183 --> 52:56.505
That completeness will come. But you
judge yourself.

52:56.706 --> 53:04.144
Are you absolutely one with Sahaj? Are you
absolutely dedicated to Sahaj?

53:04.358 --> 53:10.935
Or other things are more important to you
than Sahaja Yoga? Then, go ahead.

53:13.916 --> 53:17.997
There is something to be understood
very clearly

53:18.198 --> 53:21.638
that there’s no competition in Sahaja Yoga.
Cannot be.

53:21.839 --> 53:28.781
There’s no competition. There’s no envy,
there is no back biting, nothing.

53:28.982 --> 53:32.266
It is, you are different people. You are
saints.

53:32.467 --> 53:38.725
Your style is different. You are absolutely
above all these things.

53:38.926 --> 53:43.340
You cannot be dishonest, you cannot cheat
people, you cannot do this.

53:43.541 --> 53:47.724
And if you are doing that, even now,
then please try to understand

53:47.925 --> 53:52.214
that you have still to grow into it.

53:52.415 --> 53:56.892
Some big people think they are very
high up in Sahaja Yoga.

53:57.093 --> 54:01.304
It’s not so, it’s not so.

54:01.505 --> 54:08.455
If by thinking what you are, then
you are lost.

54:09.225 --> 54:13.482
What you have to do is to understand
“What have I done?

54:13.683 --> 54:18.519
How many people have I given realization,
to how many people have talked about it?”

54:18.720 --> 54:21.476
People are shy, even, to talk about
Sahaja Yoga.

54:21.677 --> 54:24.899
I have seen one lady was traveling
with Me. Very hot. I said, “Ba, ba

54:25.100 --> 54:28.684
who is she, this one? I don’t know.”
So she told Me the name of her guru.

54:28.885 --> 54:32.132
She said, “My guru is like this, guru
like that, like that.”

54:32.333 --> 54:36.453
I said, “My God, this heat coming out
of this woman and she’s talking so much.”

54:36.654 --> 54:40.936
But a Sahaja Yogi will not tell anybody
what is Sahaja Yoga.

54:41.137 --> 54:45.417
They feel shy. They’ll have a hundred
friends, they’ll meet a hundred friends

54:45.618 --> 54:49.748
but they will never tell them what Sahaja
Yoga is. They’ll be shy to tell them.

54:49.949 --> 54:53.782
Ah, they wouldn’t mind going to parties,
you see, if the others are drinking,

54:53.983 --> 54:57.713
they’ll say, “All right, I don’t drink.”
But they’ll not say, “I’m a Sahaja Yogi,

54:57.914 --> 55:03.678
I cannot drink, by nature I cannot drink.”
They will not say that.

55:03.879 --> 55:09.256
So this is the third point, one has to know
the announcement.

55:09.457 --> 55:13.126
You must have faith in yourself and you
must announce.

55:13.327 --> 55:16.283
All the saints announced. They were
killed for that,

55:16.484 --> 55:21.142
you saw how Socrates was given poison.
Doesn’t matter.

55:21.343 --> 55:23.963
Nobody’s going to kill you now, in these
modern times,

55:24.164 --> 55:26.062
there’s fundamental rights to exist.

55:26.263 --> 55:29.506
So nobody can kill you, take it from Me,
but you must announce.

55:29.707 --> 55:32.436
And the announcement should be
with full faith

55:32.637 --> 55:38.549
and understanding about Sahaja Yoga,
how important it is.

55:38.750 --> 55:44.549
The purpose is to transform the whole
world.

55:44.750 --> 55:48.154
With your transformation the whole world
transforms.

55:48.355 --> 55:54.733
It’s a very complicated thing, otherwise,
Sahaja Yoga is extremely complicated

55:54.934 --> 56:01.647
because how it works. The other day, you
remember, the mike had failed completely

56:01.848 --> 56:06.332
and I was giving the lecture and still
I was talking.

56:06.533 --> 56:12.315
The mike had failed but everybody was
listening to Me. What had happened?

56:12.516 --> 56:16.407
Did I enter into the ether? What happened?
I don’t know.

56:16.608 --> 56:20.825
I didn’t even know that mike had failed.
I was thinking there is mike,

56:21.026 --> 56:24.212
that the way people were listening to Me,

56:24.427 --> 56:28.230
but then they told that half lecture was
without the mike.

56:28.431 --> 56:34.314
And everybody was absolutely listening
to Me.

56:34.515 --> 56:45.770
You see, it is something that one has
to wonder and appreciate

56:45.971 --> 56:49.221
what things are happening now, where are
we going.

56:49.422 --> 56:52.428
We are going into the Kingdom of God

56:52.629 --> 56:56.894
and all the blessings, all the bliss
will be on you.

56:57.095 --> 57:04.537
Then this bliss, knowledge, everything
becomes one, nothing but bliss

57:04.738 --> 57:12.044
and you are in that state of bliss which
you don’t even know, we are just there.

57:12.245 --> 57:18.202
The greatest bliss is that you don’t know
even anything, you’re just there.

57:18.403 --> 57:23.371
I hope all of you achieve that state with
this Diwali being done in Portugal,

57:23.571 --> 57:26.969
which is a special place, I think,
of Mahalakshmi

57:27.215 --> 57:32.154
because She appeared here as they say
and also this swayambhu that we have,

57:32.355 --> 57:37.580
also is that of Mahalakshmi face, so I’m
sure it will work out for all of you.

57:37.743 --> 57:44.767
It’s a little subtle state I’m talking
about but it is, I have to tell you,

57:44.968 --> 57:47.971
that one has to rise up to that state

57:48.172 --> 57:52.961
and that state is very, very easy
to achieve for you.

57:53.162 --> 57:56.747
It slowly, gradually it - then you don’t
have to do anything,

57:56.947 --> 58:00.580
you go into a village and everything would
be there. See, now, what happened.

58:00.781 --> 58:06.021
I went to Cairo. Everybody was saluting Me.
I was wondering, what has happened to them?

58:06.222 --> 58:09.363
I went to Leningrad, thousands came
to My program.

58:09.564 --> 58:11.966
I asked them, “How did you come
to My program?” They said,

58:12.167 --> 58:15.600
“It’s obvious from Your face, it’s
obvious.”

58:15.769 --> 58:18.727
They just saw a small, little advertisement
in the newspaper,

58:18.928 --> 58:23.563
“It’s obvious that You are Divine.”
That should happen.

58:23.764 --> 58:29.040
And then you can announce that Sahaja Yoga
is the only way, then you can announce.

58:29.241 --> 58:34.427
There’s no harm. People feel very shy to say
something to their friends and things.

58:34.628 --> 58:38.454
And you must know that all of those
who you love, who you know,

58:38.655 --> 58:42.633
will go to hell or where - they’ll hang
in the limbo or what?

58:42.834 --> 58:45.652
If you have achieved it you should pull
them out also.

58:45.853 --> 58:49.584
They may not. They may not be seekers,
doesn’t matter now.

58:49.785 --> 58:52.604
I think we are finished with the seekers
now, must be -

58:52.805 --> 58:58.450
we must have people who are not so seeking,
it looks like that.

58:58.651 --> 59:02.242
So, may God bless you all.
