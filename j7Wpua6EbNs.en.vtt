00:05:17.775 --> 00:05:26.695
Today, we are going to worship the Mahalakshmi

00:05:26.775 --> 00:05:32.728
which I think is very much worshipped in this country

00:05:32.808 --> 00:05:36.761
where they worship Her as Maria

00:05:36.841 --> 00:05:42.928
and also there’s a swayambhu of Maria, you must have seen.

00:05:43.008 --> 00:05:49.595
And also there was an apparition of
Her. First I never believed that it could be,

00:05:49.675 --> 00:05:55.962
but then after feeling the vibrations, now I know it was true,

00:05:56.042 --> 00:05:59.761
that She did appear here in an apparition.

00:05:59.841 --> 00:06:05.508
She appeared before Me, also,
you must have seen, in a photograph.

00:06:10.541 --> 00:06:19.461
This is the principle by which you have risen to this state.

00:06:19.541 --> 00:06:25.962
The central path of your ascent
is created by Mahalakshmi power

00:06:26.042 --> 00:06:29.928
for the Kundalini to rise.

00:06:30.008 --> 00:06:33.661
In the temple of Mahalakshmi in Kolhapur

00:06:33.741 --> 00:06:37.628
they always sing the song of “Ude, Ude, Ambe.”

00:06:37.708 --> 00:06:46.428
So I asked the people there, “Why do you
sing Ambe’s song in Mahalakshmi’s temple?”

00:06:46.508 --> 00:06:53.561
So they said that, “We don’t
know why we do it, but is it wrong?”

00:06:53.641 --> 00:07:01.795
I said, “No, because only in the Mahalakshmi channel

00:07:01.875 --> 00:07:07.695
Kundalini can rise and Kundalini is the Amba.”

00:07:07.775 --> 00:07:11.995
That’s how, you see, they
understood and they were really amazed

00:07:12.075 --> 00:07:16.062
that I explained it very well ‘cause from ancient times

00:07:16.142 --> 00:07:23.208
this song has been sung there and
they never knew why this song is sung.

00:07:25.142 --> 00:07:33.595
Coming to the point of Mahalakshmi,
we have to understand what does it do,

00:07:33.675 --> 00:07:41.728
what it’s help is that this Mahalakshmi
channel or the Mahalakshmi’s powers

00:07:41.808 --> 00:07:54.062
have created within us a proper
balance, a proper route for Kundalini to rise.

00:07:54.142 --> 00:07:59.895
Left and right has been balanced
and She is the one who creates

00:07:59.975 --> 00:08:09.461
and makes a wider path for Kundalini to rise.

00:08:09.541 --> 00:08:16.962
This is the path of compassion and love.

00:08:17.042 --> 00:08:21.661
Through that compassion and love She creates this path

00:08:21.741 --> 00:08:29.728
because She knows that if the path is
not wide enough the Kundalini cannot rise.

00:08:29.808 --> 00:08:36.428
Ultimately, one reaches a state where you start seeking

00:08:36.508 --> 00:08:41.928
and when you start seeking, your
Mahalakshmi principle has been awakened.

00:08:42.008 --> 00:08:46.795
That is awakened and sometimes it is very strong.

00:08:46.875 --> 00:08:50.394
Then you start seeking in a mad way.

00:08:50.474 --> 00:08:54.561
I am sorry to say that many are already lost in seeking,

00:08:54.641 --> 00:09:03.795
but there are so many who have now
come to the right path and to the right ascent.

00:09:03.875 --> 00:09:08.695
The another thing this
Mahalakshmi principle does is to allow

00:09:08.775 --> 00:09:14.461
the Kundalini’s power to go to different chakras also,

00:09:14.541 --> 00:09:19.528
to make a way to different
chakras and corrects all the chakras.

00:09:19.608 --> 00:09:23.461
She is a very flexible force, I should say,

00:09:23.541 --> 00:09:27.862
which guides the Kundalini into different chakras

00:09:27.942 --> 00:09:33.062
and She understands which chakra
needs the help of the Kundalini.

00:09:33.142 --> 00:09:37.995
So you must have seen that when
the Kundalini rises how She pulsates,

00:09:38.075 --> 00:09:45.561
where She goes, where She
shows the need is of your awakening.

00:09:45.641 --> 00:09:52.828
All this works out because She is full of compassion

00:09:52.908 --> 00:09:59.661
and love that you should get your absolute truth.

00:09:59.741 --> 00:10:03.394
We have many problems as it is, you know,

00:10:03.474 --> 00:10:06.695
in Sahaja Yoga because when people are ascending

00:10:06.775 --> 00:10:14.862
they carry on with them some of
their past stones and they cannot climb.

00:10:14.942 --> 00:10:20.862
They try then they fall, they try then
they fall, then they go up again, they fall.

00:10:20.942 --> 00:10:29.142
But today I’m going to tell you about
what is the state one has to achieve.

00:10:30.474 --> 00:10:35.128
As Shri Krishna has said it in the “Gita,”

00:10:35.208 --> 00:10:38.895
describes Stitha Pragya, the second chapter,

00:10:38.975 --> 00:10:43.528
but it’s very difficult to understand Him,
He is not so clear cut as your Mother is.

00:10:43.608 --> 00:10:48.675
So people don’t understand what He is
saying. (Aside: “Can you close the...?”)

00:10:54.908 --> 00:11:00.895
And they ask the question, “How, how
do you reach that state of Stitha Pragya?

00:11:00.975 --> 00:11:05.028
How do you get to that stage?”

00:11:05.108 --> 00:11:08.128
But Gyaneshwara, when he wrote his “Gyaneshwari,”

00:11:08.208 --> 00:11:15.708
he called it as the Sahaja Stithi, means the state of Sahaj.

00:11:16.675 --> 00:11:22.795
He didn’t call Stitha Pragya. He called it as Sahaja Stithi,

00:11:22.875 --> 00:11:29.528
meaning the state of Sahaj.

00:11:29.608 --> 00:11:35.528
So he describes the Sahaj in a
very beautiful manner and very subtle.

00:11:35.608 --> 00:11:40.608
Of course, Gyaneshwara also,
very few people understand, I think.

00:11:41.975 --> 00:11:49.795
A person who reaches that state is like a mirror

00:11:49.875 --> 00:11:56.761
and so many faces pass over that
mirror, so many look into that mirror,

00:11:56.841 --> 00:12:06.361
so many decorate in front of the
mirror, but mirror is the same as it is.

00:12:06.441 --> 00:12:12.062
So the person who is a Stitha
Pragya or the person who is Sahaja

00:12:12.142 --> 00:12:21.162
is not bothered about what is facing
him, who is facing whom, where he is.

00:12:21.242 --> 00:12:28.461
He stays within himself. He contains within himself.

00:12:28.541 --> 00:12:37.162
Like the sun. If the sun plays with his different rays,

00:12:37.242 --> 00:12:41.995
he is not lost. All the rays again return to him.

00:12:42.075 --> 00:12:52.461
In the same way, all the senses that we have, all the senses

00:12:52.541 --> 00:13:00.561
that are there do play around, but
for a person who is in a Sahaja state

00:13:00.641 --> 00:13:05.162
it doesn’t matter, it makes no difference.
He’s not involved. He just plays around.

00:13:05.242 --> 00:13:12.461
Again, all of them come back to him.
This is a state you all have to achieve.

00:13:12.541 --> 00:13:16.962
Then you are really Sahaja
Yogis. But I still find people lost,

00:13:17.042 --> 00:13:22.895
getting money out of Sahaja Yoga,
some people lost getting out of leaderships,

00:13:22.975 --> 00:13:28.761
some are lost in getting jealousies and envies and all that.

00:13:28.841 --> 00:13:33.862
So that means a lot of work has to be done, still, within.

00:13:33.942 --> 00:13:39.561
There is no need to work as such if you leave everything.

00:13:39.641 --> 00:13:43.162
That’s why I always say meditate, because when you meditate,

00:13:43.242 --> 00:13:51.394
what happens, that all these things
that are pulling you down are finished.

00:13:51.474 --> 00:13:56.528
Gradually they disappear because you become your Self.

00:13:56.608 --> 00:14:00.728
You get contained by yourself and you are never bored.

00:14:00.808 --> 00:14:04.095
I am never bored. I don’t know
what boring word means, you see.

00:14:04.175 --> 00:14:09.795
When it is with you or alone, I never
get bored. What is there to get bored?

00:14:09.875 --> 00:14:14.595
If you are not involved into anything you never get bored.

00:14:14.675 --> 00:14:19.962
Another thing is you rise
above all these things, like greed.

00:14:20.042 --> 00:14:24.162
Now people who are greedy are
still involved making money here,

00:14:24.242 --> 00:14:29.095
making money there, all that thing.
Those people who are still full of lust

00:14:29.175 --> 00:14:34.828
are still making, organizing, some things like that.

00:14:34.908 --> 00:14:40.962
But in a Sahaj Stithi you just
watch. You are just a witness.

00:14:41.042 --> 00:14:47.528
You are not lost into anything that is pulling you down.

00:14:47.608 --> 00:14:51.895
This state is not difficult to achieve for you, at all,

00:14:51.975 --> 00:14:54.928
because you have crossed over your mind.

00:14:55.008 --> 00:14:58.995
Now all these things come to you through your mind.

00:14:59.075 --> 00:15:04.661
I’ve already said that mind is
a myth, which you must accept.

00:15:04.741 --> 00:15:08.828
Myth is that this mind gives you ideas.

00:15:08.908 --> 00:15:12.561
Some people think, “Yes Mother, but - yes Mother, but - .”

00:15:12.641 --> 00:15:17.995
This “but” is coming from your brain, from your mind.

00:15:18.075 --> 00:15:23.828
The brain is reality, but not the mind. The mind says “but”

00:15:23.908 --> 00:15:28.428
and then you start feeling very
depressed sometimes, unhappy,

00:15:28.508 --> 00:15:32.494
because some people feel even bad
because they are very good people,

00:15:32.574 --> 00:15:37.042
that there are so few Sahaja Yogis. Doesn’t matter.

00:15:38.042 --> 00:15:45.128
Just watch and this watching state,
this witness state is the Sahaja Stithi.

00:15:45.208 --> 00:15:49.695
In that you become so subtle, you become your Self,

00:15:49.775 --> 00:15:56.062
meaning so subtle that nothing can
disturb you, nothing can change you.

00:15:56.142 --> 00:16:02.995
Now see the nature as it is. You
know there are ninety-two elements

00:16:03.075 --> 00:16:06.695
and ninety-two elements, none of them can be...

00:16:06.775 --> 00:16:16.128
say for example, you cannot
make silver into gold. Gold into silver.

00:16:16.208 --> 00:16:21.995
The atoms are so arranged that they have certain valencies

00:16:22.075 --> 00:16:26.428
and apart from atom, even molecules are so arranged

00:16:26.508 --> 00:16:30.828
that they have their own structure. You cannot change.

00:16:30.908 --> 00:16:33.695
If you try to change then you will create bombs,

00:16:33.775 --> 00:16:38.528
atomic bomb, this bomb. It’s absolutely destructive.

00:16:38.608 --> 00:16:42.728
It’s only human beings who can change, who can transform.

00:16:42.808 --> 00:16:48.962
Now look at the blessings that you are a
human being and you can be transformed

00:16:49.042 --> 00:16:55.595
and you can be made into a new element that is the Self.

00:16:55.675 --> 00:16:58.494
This is the specialty of human beings.

00:16:58.574 --> 00:17:01.461
But if somebody there is a false guru or somebody,

00:17:01.541 --> 00:17:04.661
he tries to do something, you’ll explode.

00:17:04.741 --> 00:17:09.428
I have seen people who have
been to false gurus, they still faint,

00:17:09.508 --> 00:17:13.494
they still have problems, they still get troubled

00:17:13.574 --> 00:17:18.695
more than people who have been without them.

00:17:18.775 --> 00:17:21.761
They are also all right now, much of them are improved;

00:17:21.841 --> 00:17:28.494
but this is one thing one should understand, that in one way

00:17:28.574 --> 00:17:32.828
when you are analyzing and when you are breaking an atom

00:17:32.908 --> 00:17:38.095
or you are breaking a molecule and trying to transform,

00:17:38.175 --> 00:17:43.394
it explodes. It doesn’t work out.

00:17:43.474 --> 00:17:48.561
The other way round is that when you try to synthesize,

00:17:48.641 --> 00:17:51.761
then you can form anything in the nature.

00:17:51.841 --> 00:17:55.728
Like, this has now been brought out by synthesizing,

00:17:55.808 --> 00:18:00.028
this plastic is created by synthesizing.

00:18:00.108 --> 00:18:05.162
Matter can be synthesized and can be brought together

00:18:05.242 --> 00:18:11.162
and human beings have to get synthesized also.

00:18:11.242 --> 00:18:20.128
They can be synthesized better than
matter because they change, they transform.

00:18:20.208 --> 00:18:29.461
Now say example, there is gold. You
make gold into ornaments, make into anything.

00:18:29.541 --> 00:18:37.761
It remains all the time, all the
time gold. Gold is gold. It is there.

00:18:37.841 --> 00:18:42.361
It is not that by changing them into ornaments it changes.

00:18:42.441 --> 00:18:45.028
Its element is there. Gold is there.

00:18:45.108 --> 00:18:49.862
But for human beings they get
transformed when they are synthesized.

00:18:49.942 --> 00:18:59.461
This is a very big difference between the
matter and the nature and human beings.

00:18:59.541 --> 00:19:05.828
Matter, nature are different absolutely from human beings.

00:19:05.908 --> 00:19:13.394
Human beings, once they are
transformed, it’s like a living process.

00:19:13.474 --> 00:19:20.461
They become like flowers but still
it is not that you see in the nature.

00:19:20.541 --> 00:19:26.895
It’s not the same as you see in the
nature because nature doesn’t have a mind.

00:19:26.975 --> 00:19:33.862
It doesn’t have a mind. It just is under the control

00:19:33.942 --> 00:19:38.661
of the Divine or nature that it’s working out that way.

00:19:38.741 --> 00:19:43.875
But here you are under your own control.

00:19:44.975 --> 00:19:48.928
Here you can control yourself.

00:19:49.008 --> 00:19:54.595
In this synthesis which is growing inside you what you find,

00:19:54.675 --> 00:19:58.995
that you are completely in control of yourself.

00:19:59.075 --> 00:20:02.162
You know what is happening to you.

00:20:02.242 --> 00:20:07.595
Now you start seeing yourself
separating from all these things.

00:20:07.675 --> 00:20:13.428
Some people come and tell Me, “Mother,
see, my ego is very bad, you just take it out.”

00:20:13.508 --> 00:20:17.895
He sees his ego, he sees what is the problem is.

00:20:17.975 --> 00:20:22.394
Somebody says, “Mother, my Nabhi is
very bad,I’m still busy with the money.”

00:20:22.474 --> 00:20:29.095
He sees it. First starts the knowledge about yourself,

00:20:29.175 --> 00:20:36.162
we call as self-knowledge. But one
has to even go beyond self-knowledge.

00:20:36.242 --> 00:20:40.608
By that knowledge, what do you do, we have to see.

00:20:42.942 --> 00:20:48.795
When you have the knowledge,
first we say there’s no knowledge,

00:20:48.875 --> 00:20:52.162
people have no knowledge, they
are ignorant, there’s darkness, all that.

00:20:52.242 --> 00:20:58.828
Now the light has come, you can see.
You can know what’s wrong with you.

00:20:58.908 --> 00:21:05.528
Now you start separating yourself from all
those things that you see as wrong with you.

00:21:05.608 --> 00:21:10.995
You see them getting out. So
many nonsensical things there are.

00:21:11.075 --> 00:21:15.928
Like, we have jealousies, envy, greed and lust.

00:21:16.008 --> 00:21:20.394
I mean, it’s horrible things to
say on a Diwali function, see.

00:21:20.474 --> 00:21:27.394
So the Diwali is that one by one
so many lights are enlightened

00:21:27.474 --> 00:21:30.428
and you start seeing it first.

00:21:30.508 --> 00:21:34.428
First you start seeing what is wrong within you,

00:21:34.508 --> 00:21:38.062
and then as you see it, you don’t want it.

00:21:38.142 --> 00:21:45.761
Then you work out to get rid of it, to become clean.

00:21:45.841 --> 00:21:50.595
Now this also knowledge disappears.

00:21:50.675 --> 00:21:57.561
You don’t have to have any
knowledge. You are there. You are there.

00:21:57.641 --> 00:22:02.561
There is no need to know about
your chakras, you are just there.

00:22:02.641 --> 00:22:06.695
At that stage nothing matters.

00:22:06.775 --> 00:22:11.394
You become just like a stone, I can say.

00:22:11.474 --> 00:22:18.028
Stone with a brain intact and
a heart intact and a liver intact.

00:22:18.108 --> 00:22:23.162
You just don’t mind anything, don’t get upset with anything.

00:22:23.242 --> 00:22:32.062
You just enjoy the love and compassion that’s flowing.

00:22:32.142 --> 00:22:36.995
And the ripples that come back to
you, even that is lost after some time

00:22:37.075 --> 00:22:41.208
and you are just nothing but Sahaj.

00:22:42.075 --> 00:22:47.461
That is the state people achieved.
In those days they achieved this state.

00:22:47.541 --> 00:22:50.728
But with that, what lacking happened, that they’d get lost.

00:22:50.808 --> 00:22:54.661
They all got lost. They couldn’t do anything to others.

00:22:54.741 --> 00:23:00.428
One person getting it, becoming great,
finished. Or two persons at the most.

00:23:00.508 --> 00:23:04.394
So now Sahaja Yoga stands, first of all,

00:23:04.474 --> 00:23:08.728
at the knowledge state, where you have the knowledge.

00:23:08.808 --> 00:23:13.628
First, you should first of all have
full knowledge about yourself.

00:23:13.708 --> 00:23:17.095
The self-knowledge should be complete.

00:23:17.175 --> 00:23:21.695
Then in the third stage we should
say that when the knowledge is full

00:23:21.775 --> 00:23:26.928
you should get rid of all those
things that you know about yourself,

00:23:27.008 --> 00:23:31.628
which are useless, which are hampering
your progress, which you know is wrong.

00:23:31.708 --> 00:23:37.428
Like, I see some dirt falling on
my sari, I’ll just clean it out like that.

00:23:37.508 --> 00:23:43.062
Then you start separating yourself into that Sahaja state.

00:23:43.142 --> 00:23:49.428
But still in Sahaja Yoga you develop another dimension

00:23:49.508 --> 00:23:56.494
which is collective consciousness.
That is the modern Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:56.574 --> 00:24:02.428
In the olden days they didn’t
have this, so they just all got lost.

00:24:02.508 --> 00:24:07.795
Now you have collective consciousness
and in that collective consciousness

00:24:07.875 --> 00:24:13.361
you start feeling others, feeling
for others, compassion for others

00:24:13.441 --> 00:24:19.895
and you start working out for others.
In that also, sometimes, you know,

00:24:19.975 --> 00:24:23.128
when you are working around, you
think, "How much money I can make?

00:24:23.208 --> 00:24:26.170
What I can achieve as a leader?"

00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:29.962
or some sort of thing is still there.

00:24:30.042 --> 00:24:33.995
But this collective consciousness starts growing.

00:24:34.075 --> 00:24:37.561
When it starts growing, then you become as I said,

00:24:37.641 --> 00:24:42.675
drop in the ocean, means complete ocean, you become.

00:24:43.808 --> 00:24:51.128
You become complete ocean. So the
ocean has its own mariadas. It doesn’t bother.

00:24:51.208 --> 00:24:54.862
It has to live with its mariadas,
it lives with its mariadas.

00:24:54.942 --> 00:24:57.828
It doesn’t want to cross any boundaries, all right.

00:24:57.908 --> 00:25:01.828
Accept it. It will not cross its boundaries.

00:25:01.908 --> 00:25:06.728
In the same way it happens that you are very self-contained.

00:25:06.808 --> 00:25:11.962
You are not selfish, but you become very self-contained.

00:25:12.042 --> 00:25:15.928
You are contained within yourself.

00:25:16.008 --> 00:25:20.761
I know many Sahaja Yogis are angry that
I have not punished many horrible people

00:25:20.841 --> 00:25:24.995
who have been troubling Sahaja Yoga. I don’t have to bother.

00:25:25.075 --> 00:25:28.162
There’s Paramchaitanya which is doing a lot of work.

00:25:28.242 --> 00:25:32.995
Let it look after it. Why should I bother about anyone?

00:25:33.075 --> 00:25:38.175
You see, after all, things are
working out so why to interfere?

00:25:39.108 --> 00:25:47.995
My job is just to watch, just to see. That’s sufficient.

00:25:48.075 --> 00:25:54.695
There’s no need for Me to kill
anybody in this lifetime or to destroy.

00:25:54.775 --> 00:25:59.062
They are destroyed by themselves. I have told you that

00:25:59.142 --> 00:26:03.695
I need not expose people, but whichever country I go,

00:26:03.775 --> 00:26:07.595
I find people get exposed. I run
away from there, really, sometimes,

00:26:07.675 --> 00:26:11.494
thinking, "God knows what more is going to come."

00:26:11.574 --> 00:26:17.494
Even little attention on any country, it just works out.

00:26:17.574 --> 00:26:23.095
Even without My knowledge, “Oh
My God,” I said, “When did I do that?”

00:26:23.175 --> 00:26:31.928
So one has to become, of course, he
becomes the power of Divine love, no doubt.

00:26:32.008 --> 00:26:37.661
He becomes the power of Divine
love, but he doesn’t handle it.

00:26:37.741 --> 00:26:40.795
Left to this Divine power which is working,

00:26:40.875 --> 00:26:46.895
which is also separated from
Me, you’ll be surprised. I am alone.

00:26:46.975 --> 00:26:52.361
Absolutely alone. Even this power is separated from Me,

00:26:52.441 --> 00:26:56.461
but this power knows what is good for human beings,

00:26:56.541 --> 00:27:00.494
what is good for Sahaja Yoga. It works on its own.

00:27:00.574 --> 00:27:05.461
I don’t interfere. It’s a reflex
action, believe Me, it’s a reflex action.

00:27:05.541 --> 00:27:09.995
Maybe you might say, “Mother, you
have made it.” All right, whatever it is,

00:27:10.075 --> 00:27:15.628
but I don’t interfere with it. I
don’t have to tell anything to it.

00:27:15.708 --> 00:27:18.828
It just works and it’s working so well.

00:27:18.908 --> 00:27:22.628
I’ll give you an example. Once in England long time back,

00:27:22.708 --> 00:27:24.728
they said, “Mother, we want to have a very long summer.”

00:27:24.808 --> 00:27:26.828
I said, “Why do you want to ask such things?”

00:27:26.908 --> 00:27:30.962
“No, no, Mother, we must have a long
summer, a very long summer, very - “

00:27:31.042 --> 00:27:38.728
Three or four times they said it and it
was a very long, horrible summer in London.

00:27:38.808 --> 00:27:42.661
And it’s not like India where
we have air conditioning, fans,

00:27:42.741 --> 00:27:47.062
something we have, at least
hand fans. There was nothing there.

00:27:47.142 --> 00:27:50.862
So we didn’t know. We had a
little gallery, we used to sleep in that.

00:27:50.942 --> 00:27:59.062
So we went to the shop in England
and we asked in London City, for a fan.

00:27:59.142 --> 00:28:03.128
So they said, “All right, after three months. You order us.”

00:28:03.208 --> 00:28:07.561
After three months when it will be
very cold they will give us the fan.

00:28:07.641 --> 00:28:12.895
We said, “We don’t want any fans.”
So My daughter sent two fans by plane.

00:28:12.975 --> 00:28:16.394
And that’s how we managed.
You see, Indians, we feel very hot

00:28:16.474 --> 00:28:19.128
because we have had a lot of sun in our country,

00:28:19.208 --> 00:28:22.728
we feel much hotter than any one
of you. The way you sit in the sun,

00:28:22.808 --> 00:28:26.761
you know, we can’t understand.
You know, in India they used to say,

00:28:26.841 --> 00:28:31.561
"An Englishman and a mad dog can only go in the sun."

00:28:31.641 --> 00:28:34.995
So our situation is like that,

00:28:35.075 --> 00:28:38.095
that we cannot go in the sun because we have had too much.

00:28:38.175 --> 00:28:43.428
And this summer, you see, was so tremendous, so tremendous

00:28:43.508 --> 00:28:50.361
that after that one thing good happened.
That ochre color appeared on the leaves

00:28:50.441 --> 00:28:54.628
and then gradually the red and all that of the autumn season

00:28:54.708 --> 00:28:59.128
was best at that time and then one Sahaja Yogi dreamt that,

00:28:59.208 --> 00:29:03.028
“Mother asked me to drive in Her back yard.”

00:29:03.108 --> 00:29:09.661
So he told everybody that, “Mother has
been asking me to drive in the back yard.”

00:29:09.741 --> 00:29:13.394
So I telephoned to him, I didn’t
know he had dreamt like that,

00:29:13.474 --> 00:29:17.895
that, “Can you come along for a
while, I want to go and see this autumn

00:29:17.975 --> 00:29:23.028
all over England.” So he came
and we were driving, miles together

00:29:23.108 --> 00:29:27.928
and then they told Me, “Mother, it was
so, he told us that that was My back yard.”

00:29:28.008 --> 00:29:32.461
Can you imagine that he was
driving for miles together, beautiful,

00:29:32.541 --> 00:29:38.561
just like Canada, the whole England
was filled with the beauty of autumn.

00:29:38.641 --> 00:29:43.895
So even if there’s something like
that happens, it is compensated.

00:29:43.975 --> 00:29:49.795
It is compensated and so beautiful it
was, all the people were out in the autumn

00:29:49.875 --> 00:29:54.795
to see the beautiful colors of
the nature, of different greenery,

00:29:54.875 --> 00:29:59.394
yellow, ochre, all kinds of colors were there.

00:29:59.474 --> 00:30:03.028
Surprisingly, in that country you never see all that.

00:30:03.108 --> 00:30:08.862
And because of the sun shining
so bright, it was compensated.

00:30:08.942 --> 00:30:16.661
It was compensated by this Paramchaitanya.
So the Paramchaitanya is looking after this.

00:30:16.741 --> 00:30:23.528
All these things are managed by
Paramchaitanya. I am doing nothing.

00:30:23.608 --> 00:30:27.162
I am Nishkriya. I’m just sitting down and watching.

00:30:27.242 --> 00:30:32.128
To Me nothing matters. You see,
it’s working out slowly and steadily.

00:30:32.208 --> 00:30:34.995
Ha, if you tell Me something supposing, they said,

00:30:35.075 --> 00:30:37.962
“Mother, we prayed to You and
it happened.” All right, maybe,

00:30:38.042 --> 00:30:43.361
these people must have heard, around Me. Not me, you see,

00:30:43.441 --> 00:30:49.895
and they must have done the job and
for that I’m not responsible, in no way.

00:30:49.975 --> 00:30:55.394
Like one lady in Mexico had a son,
was very sick and was about to die.

00:30:55.474 --> 00:30:58.628
She wrote a letter to Me, three letters she wrote

00:30:58.708 --> 00:31:03.628
that, “My son is going to die, he’s a
young fellow, studying in Harvard.”

00:31:03.708 --> 00:31:06.628
I didn’t do anything. I never wrote to her.

00:31:06.708 --> 00:31:10.162
Fourth letter came that he’s
completely cured. Now I didn’t do that

00:31:10.242 --> 00:31:14.661
because I was just sitting in one
place and how is it, it has worked out?

00:31:14.741 --> 00:31:19.828
So everything, you see, you think I do is not done by Me.

00:31:19.908 --> 00:31:24.962
Is done by this Paramchaitanya. Because
I’m also separated from you, completely,

00:31:25.042 --> 00:31:29.628
absolutely separated. So they
say, “You pray, now.” You can pray.

00:31:29.708 --> 00:31:32.695
If you pray, you pray to these deities that are around,

00:31:32.775 --> 00:31:36.661
you pray to all these ganas and all that, not to Me.

00:31:36.741 --> 00:31:39.461
Because I have nothing to do with it.

00:31:39.541 --> 00:31:43.028
You see, they don’t tell Me that I
have to do this or I have to do that.

00:31:43.108 --> 00:31:46.962
So why should I tell them do
this or do that? It is like that.

00:31:47.042 --> 00:31:51.428
And in that state only we can say you are in a Sahaja state,

00:31:51.508 --> 00:31:54.661
where you don’t desire anything, you don’t want anything.

00:31:54.741 --> 00:31:59.761
I do everything. All kinds of things,
I am doing. Like the sun is doing,

00:31:59.841 --> 00:32:07.761
I am also doing in the sense that I’m
looking after things, flowers, this that.

00:32:07.841 --> 00:32:13.028
I am also receiving presents
from you, I’m receiving this from you

00:32:13.108 --> 00:32:17.428
and then see, I don’t receive anything.

00:32:17.508 --> 00:32:21.695
I don’t have anything. I have no interest in it.

00:32:21.775 --> 00:32:24.595
But you want to give for your joy, all right, have it.

00:32:24.675 --> 00:32:27.162
You want to put flowers, all right, you can have flowers.

00:32:27.242 --> 00:32:32.728
Even if there’s flowers or not makes no
difference to Me as a person, I’m saying.

00:32:32.808 --> 00:32:39.028
But as Your Mother I love you. All of you I love.

00:32:39.108 --> 00:32:42.162
But I don’t do anything as such
to love you. And everybody says,

00:32:42.242 --> 00:32:47.128
“Mother, You love us so much.” When?
When did I love you? I never even kissed you.

00:32:47.208 --> 00:32:51.095
But you always say I love you very much. So what is this?

00:32:51.175 --> 00:32:56.995
Who is working it out, this? Is
something which is not Me, beyond Me.

00:32:57.075 --> 00:33:01.862
This is the state in which, once
we rise, we call it as Sahaja Stithi.

00:33:01.942 --> 00:33:07.494
In the Sahaja Stithi you think you are
doing nothing. Everything is working out.

00:33:07.574 --> 00:33:11.595
But at this stage if I tell you, you
say, “Oh, we are not doing anything.

00:33:11.675 --> 00:33:15.561
Why should we spread Sahaja Yoga? It’s not our job.”

00:33:15.641 --> 00:33:20.162
Just now, that’s not your stithi, that’s why.

00:33:20.242 --> 00:33:23.461
So you have to rise up to that state.

00:33:23.541 --> 00:33:29.394
That’s only possible when you are in the knowledge state,

00:33:29.474 --> 00:33:32.695
where you have self-knowledge,
the knowledge of the whole world.

00:33:32.775 --> 00:33:36.494
But if you go beyond knowledge
then you must have seen many a times,

00:33:36.574 --> 00:33:42.062
I just say something. I just say something and it is there.

00:33:42.142 --> 00:33:45.528
I never feel vibrations of anyone or anything.

00:33:45.608 --> 00:33:48.962
I don’t feel My Kundalini, either nor any chakras, nothing,

00:33:49.042 --> 00:33:52.695
but I know, know automatically like a computer.

00:33:52.775 --> 00:33:58.062
But that computer also I am not. Just
it’s trouble, it’s difficult to explain to you

00:33:58.142 --> 00:34:01.761
what is this stithi is because you have to achieve it.

00:34:01.841 --> 00:34:06.494
Once you achieve it then you are in a very subtle state

00:34:06.574 --> 00:34:15.561
and that subtle state is nothing but
bliss. But that bliss also you cannot enjoy.

00:34:15.641 --> 00:34:23.062
I don’t know how to enjoy everything.
Supposing now you say, “Jai Mataji.”

00:34:23.142 --> 00:34:29.361
I forget even you are calling Me.
I also say, “Jai Mataji,” finished.

00:34:29.441 --> 00:34:34.062
See it is such a simple thing one has to understand

00:34:34.142 --> 00:34:37.761
that the state in which one has to rise

00:34:37.841 --> 00:34:42.062
is a state where without doing
anything, everything works out.

00:34:42.142 --> 00:34:45.628
If that is your state, all right. But it’s not so.

00:34:45.708 --> 00:34:50.595
So you have to rise up to that
state by doing. First you have to do it.

00:34:50.675 --> 00:34:57.494
First you have to know and then knowledge
has no need, you don’t have to know,

00:34:57.574 --> 00:35:01.962
but first that has to be worked
out and brought to that level.

00:35:02.042 --> 00:35:07.028
Now Diwali has the significance
that on Diwali day, what we do,

00:35:07.108 --> 00:35:15.128
we put lights all over. So that
we put Sahaja Yoga everywhere.

00:35:15.208 --> 00:35:19.875
But does the light know about itself?

00:35:23.042 --> 00:35:31.675
Does the candle knows about itself? She
enlightens everything but she doesn’t know.

00:35:34.508 --> 00:35:41.494
Like the moon, which is giving
moonlight, does it know itself?

00:35:41.574 --> 00:35:46.108
Does he enjoy? Nothing.

00:35:47.608 --> 00:35:51.761
In the same way it happens that on a Diwali day you are,

00:35:51.841 --> 00:35:55.595
what you are doing is enlightening
people, you are enlightening them,

00:35:55.675 --> 00:36:00.862
you are doing all this for them,
it’s a good idea. You must do it.

00:36:00.942 --> 00:36:07.441
But also know that you have to become the
lamp yourself which doesn’t know yourself.

00:36:08.675 --> 00:36:14.062
So there are two messages. The first
one is that we have to enlighten the world,

00:36:14.142 --> 00:36:17.128
we have to enlighten others. This is the first one.

00:36:17.208 --> 00:36:25.361
Then we have to become that which is
the light itself and light itself doesn’t know.

00:36:25.441 --> 00:36:28.795
Yesterday you were singing,
“You are the light,” you are this thing.

00:36:28.875 --> 00:36:36.428
All right, so what? I was just saying,
‘Yes, I am the light, I don’t know Myself.”

00:36:36.508 --> 00:36:40.361
That’s the state where you don’t know you are the light.

00:36:40.441 --> 00:36:43.561
You just don’t know that. It doesn’t come into your head.

00:36:43.641 --> 00:36:47.761
Even so many times you have sung, you
have said thousand names there are, everything,

00:36:47.841 --> 00:36:54.095
but it doesn’t come into My head
that this is Me you are talking about.

00:36:54.175 --> 00:36:58.361
Now when I say this I don’t know how you will react.

00:36:58.441 --> 00:37:02.895
Because human beings are queer
birds, you see. You tell them something.

00:37:02.975 --> 00:37:09.862
Maybe that your ego might come up and
you say, “Yes, yes, I am also just the same.”

00:37:09.942 --> 00:37:13.661
There are many, many who came
like that, that, “I am higher than Mataji.”

00:37:13.741 --> 00:37:20.862
Ba, ba maybe, I don’t know. There
are many who said that, “I am Kalki.”

00:37:20.942 --> 00:37:25.361
Nowadays there’s one fellow going round
saying, “I am Kalki, I am this, I am that.”

00:37:25.441 --> 00:37:30.808
All right, doesn’t matter. You be that, very good idea.

00:37:41.242 --> 00:37:49.862
But if I say I am Adi Shakti that
means I don’t know what I am, really.

00:37:49.942 --> 00:37:52.828
I had to say because people
said, “Mother, you have to declare.”

00:37:52.908 --> 00:37:57.162
Declare what? Whatever I am, that I am.

00:37:57.242 --> 00:38:01.761
Now I find by declaration you people started

00:38:01.841 --> 00:38:05.595
growing more, so all right, have it that way.

00:38:05.675 --> 00:38:11.394
But there is no need for anyone to
declare anything or to say anything.

00:38:11.474 --> 00:38:18.862
That is the state one has to achieve.
But to get to that state you have to work.

00:38:18.942 --> 00:38:25.128
And work is to spread Sahaja Yoga.
You have to enlighten many lights.

00:38:25.208 --> 00:38:30.461
That means you will realize that you
are the light which is enlightening all that,

00:38:30.541 --> 00:38:36.394
and then in a subtle way you
will realize that, “I am the light.”

00:38:36.474 --> 00:38:40.895
Many Sahaja Yogis are doing
a lot of work and working it out,

00:38:40.975 --> 00:38:45.828
spreading Sahaja Yoga. It’s a
very great thing that has happened.

00:38:45.908 --> 00:38:48.895
In so many countries, the way it has spread,

00:38:48.975 --> 00:38:54.428
it has removed the darkness of religion which was outside.

00:38:54.508 --> 00:39:02.928
It was darkness of so many - racialism,
thisism, thatism, all it has removed.

00:39:03.008 --> 00:39:10.528
So this has worked out, the cleansing.
For you to have the clean water to swim.

00:39:10.608 --> 00:39:17.428
Once you start doing that then you realize gradually

00:39:17.508 --> 00:39:24.561
that now the sea is clean, we just
watch, we just see how it is working.

00:39:24.641 --> 00:39:28.595
I hope in your lifetime only, you achieve this state

00:39:28.675 --> 00:39:36.928
where you achieve your complete
work of self-realization to others.

00:39:37.008 --> 00:39:41.128
Those who do not give self-realization
to others, who just come for the pujas,

00:39:41.208 --> 00:39:45.761
this thing, are mediocres. They cannot rise very high.

00:39:45.841 --> 00:39:49.394
This coming to puja is what, like,
you just rise higher with the puja

00:39:49.474 --> 00:39:53.461
then again you go down. But those who steadily grow

00:39:53.541 --> 00:39:57.595
will grow into this state, I am sure, in My lifetime

00:39:57.675 --> 00:40:02.162
I should be able to see such people
who are such that if they stand here

00:40:02.242 --> 00:40:07.628
they emit peace, they emit light, they
emit everything. Because they are the light.

00:40:07.708 --> 00:40:10.995
They don’t have to enlighten, but they are the light.

00:40:11.075 --> 00:40:16.761
Such a stage has to be developed
and to be worked out within yourself.

00:40:16.841 --> 00:40:20.461
And this state has been described by so many poets,

00:40:20.541 --> 00:40:24.761
so many saints and everything, but they were at that stage

00:40:24.841 --> 00:40:27.928
and people thought, what is this they
are talking? They thought they were mad.

00:40:28.008 --> 00:40:30.628
Even for Christ, they thought He is to be crucified,

00:40:30.708 --> 00:40:34.862
because they couldn’t understand
it. Now you are gradually growing

00:40:34.942 --> 00:40:39.661
one by one, step by step, step by
step, so now you understand this.

00:40:39.741 --> 00:40:42.461
You understand Christ, you understand all these people

00:40:42.541 --> 00:40:46.494
and at this stage you have still to work.

00:40:46.574 --> 00:40:49.995
Those who do not work for Sahaja Yoga cannot rise higher.

00:40:50.075 --> 00:40:54.862
You have to work for Sahaja
Yoga, you have to spread it more,

00:40:54.942 --> 00:41:00.028
you have to work it out, enjoy each
other, this brotherhood, everything.

00:41:00.108 --> 00:41:08.128
All the qualities of a beautiful
personality should be there.

00:41:08.208 --> 00:41:15.928
Unless and until you achieve that state,
then you can only rise higher to that stage

00:41:16.008 --> 00:41:20.995
which I am describing is a Sahaja
Stithi. In that state you will be perfect.

00:41:21.075 --> 00:41:28.628
But you must get rid of all these things
and today is a day, also of Mahalakshmi.

00:41:28.708 --> 00:41:33.128
The first thing is, I think, this madness about money.

00:41:33.208 --> 00:41:37.062
This should be understood that it’s real madness.

00:41:37.142 --> 00:41:40.095
Those who are rich have no
money. You ask a rich man, he’ll say,

00:41:40.175 --> 00:41:45.361
“Oh, I have no money.” Why?
What is this all this? This is no money.

00:41:45.441 --> 00:41:49.428
You ask the poor man, he has no
money. A rich man has no money.

00:41:49.508 --> 00:41:56.795
So it’s a kind of a greed which is
never satisfied, which never helps you.

00:41:56.875 --> 00:42:01.862
All these little, little things have to first drop out.

00:42:01.942 --> 00:42:04.828
Then your work should cleanse
you. In your work you will know

00:42:04.908 --> 00:42:07.695
whether you are cleansing or not. In the work you will know

00:42:07.775 --> 00:42:14.095
how you are doing your work. Once
that is done, then I think I am sure

00:42:14.175 --> 00:42:19.728
some of you will achieve that
state in My lifetime, in your lifetime.

00:42:19.808 --> 00:42:23.394
That’s what I want today to tell you, on a Diwali day,

00:42:23.474 --> 00:42:28.128
that we have to become subtler and subtler and subtler.

00:42:28.208 --> 00:42:32.628
We should not be influenced by outside things.

00:42:32.708 --> 00:42:39.528
Like, the outside thing is that,
some sort of a fashion starts.

00:42:39.608 --> 00:42:45.928
People who follow fashions are
stupid. They are like blind mices.

00:42:46.008 --> 00:42:50.628
Anybody can lead them into anything,
now do this, they do it. That, they do it.

00:42:50.708 --> 00:42:55.695
So if you try to follow any kind of a thought

00:42:55.775 --> 00:42:58.862
which is given to us by somebody else,

00:42:58.942 --> 00:43:03.062
in that thought you’ll completely
lose yourself and you'll become,

00:43:03.142 --> 00:43:10.695
"I am this, I am Christian, I am Hindu, I
am Muslim, I am Muss leman." Stupidity.

00:43:10.775 --> 00:43:19.461
You are your Self. You are the
Spirit. And when you become the Spirit

00:43:19.541 --> 00:43:24.895
then you start knowing so much
and that knowledge is very important.

00:43:24.975 --> 00:43:30.761
This is the gap between a saint and a normal human being,

00:43:30.841 --> 00:43:34.361
which you have crossed gradually
so you know what are the problems

00:43:34.441 --> 00:43:37.828
of the human beings are and dealing with human beings,

00:43:37.908 --> 00:43:41.461
you know how to deal with them.

00:43:41.541 --> 00:43:46.394
In Sahaja Yoga only the collective
consciousness, in modern times, has come.

00:43:46.474 --> 00:43:52.795
This collective consciousness, also
the saints had, but they would not say.

00:43:52.875 --> 00:43:57.361
They would not say anything. They would not bother.

00:43:57.441 --> 00:44:02.062
All right, this fellow has this chakra,
let him go to hell. Doesn’t care.

00:44:02.142 --> 00:44:05.394
It’s not a question of not caring, but not bothered.

00:44:05.474 --> 00:44:10.394
They were sitting in a state
which was just recording, all right.

00:44:10.474 --> 00:44:13.728
An ugly man goes before the mirror, all right,

00:44:13.808 --> 00:44:17.828
if a beautiful person goes before the mirror is all right.

00:44:17.908 --> 00:44:25.095
In the same way these people
start allowing people to pass through

00:44:25.175 --> 00:44:28.128
but we have to understand, still we have to grow.

00:44:28.208 --> 00:44:31.895
We have to still grow by working it out.

00:44:31.975 --> 00:44:38.062
Those people who are working
it out and spreading it all over

00:44:38.142 --> 00:44:43.661
are the ones which are really very much there

00:44:43.741 --> 00:44:53.528
and to them, I must say, the
Paramchaitanya is just their servant.

00:44:53.608 --> 00:44:59.595
I have seen people who desire something, it works out.

00:44:59.675 --> 00:45:02.795
They ask for something, it works out.

00:45:02.875 --> 00:45:06.628
For that, now, what should we have, is the point.

00:45:06.708 --> 00:45:11.895
After getting realization, after getting
everything, what should we have

00:45:11.975 --> 00:45:17.928
that we develop is the faith. Faith in yourself.

00:45:18.008 --> 00:45:24.595
Faith in that you are the Spirit,

00:45:24.675 --> 00:45:30.508
that you have the light and you have to enlighten others.

00:45:32.675 --> 00:45:37.028
This faith when it grows deeper and deeper then you think,

00:45:37.108 --> 00:45:42.828
"Oh, what I am? I am the Spirit."

00:45:42.908 --> 00:45:48.428
If you are the Spirit then this whole nature is with you.

00:45:48.508 --> 00:45:55.095
I know of some Sahaja Yogis. One of them was a fisherman.

00:45:55.175 --> 00:45:59.595
He was doing Sahaja Yoga work. He has tremendous faith in Me

00:45:59.675 --> 00:46:05.828
and somehow he was going to
another village to do Sahaja Yoga work.

00:46:05.908 --> 00:46:14.062
When he came out of his little hut he
found it’s all full of clouds, black clouds.

00:46:14.142 --> 00:46:17.162
So he raised his hand and said,
“See now, I’m going for Mother’s work.

00:46:17.242 --> 00:46:22.494
And you dare not start raining.
You keep as you are, hanging there

00:46:22.574 --> 00:46:26.962
till I finish my work,” you see.
Because he was going by boat.

00:46:27.042 --> 00:46:30.628
And other Sahaja Yogis thought, “What is he talking about?”

00:46:30.708 --> 00:46:34.028
They all got into the boat, they reached the other village.

00:46:34.108 --> 00:46:37.828
They gave realization to others,
he finished his lecturing, everything,

00:46:37.908 --> 00:46:41.062
he came back on the shore and he entered his house.

00:46:41.142 --> 00:46:47.062
When he was closing the door, “All right,
so go ahead,” he said. And he managed.

00:46:47.142 --> 00:46:52.695
So the complete faith that this
Paramchaitanya is like your servant,

00:46:52.775 --> 00:46:58.828
is all the time waiting there to serve
you. Whatever you say will happen.

00:46:58.908 --> 00:47:05.095
But first you must have complete faith
in yourself that you are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:47:05.175 --> 00:47:08.595
Even now I find, you see, people have some lust,

00:47:08.675 --> 00:47:12.895
some sort of a horrible things in them.

00:47:12.975 --> 00:47:18.995
So first you must be established in Dharma.
Dharma, is, as you know, is righteousness.

00:47:19.075 --> 00:47:22.595
If you are in the righteousness, there’s no question.

00:47:22.675 --> 00:47:26.062
There’s no question that this Paramchaitanya won’t obey you.

00:47:26.142 --> 00:47:31.661
But supposing you want today
something and it doesn’t work out,

00:47:31.741 --> 00:47:36.062
then even to get disappointed
itself is not a very good thing.

00:47:36.142 --> 00:47:45.095
Disappointment also is a sign of your immaturity.

00:47:45.175 --> 00:47:48.574
What is there to be disappointed?

00:47:50.175 --> 00:47:55.661
Maybe that that was good for you. Supposing I lose My way.

00:47:55.741 --> 00:48:00.461
I’m going this way and I lose
My way, I don’t know where to go.

00:48:00.541 --> 00:48:04.995
So I get lost, it’s all right. What is
there? Wherever I am, I am there.

00:48:05.075 --> 00:48:08.494
How can I be lost to Myself? And then what I find,

00:48:08.574 --> 00:48:12.862
that I had to go that way because I was to meet somebody,

00:48:12.942 --> 00:48:16.895
I’ve been wanting to meet
somebody and meet that person there.

00:48:16.975 --> 00:48:21.028
Can you imagine? Such things happen with Me,

00:48:21.108 --> 00:48:24.828
and even if I don’t meet, so what? I was to go that side.

00:48:24.908 --> 00:48:28.162
I have to leave some vibrations, perhaps. It’s like that.

00:48:28.242 --> 00:48:35.928
So once you know that whatever you
are doing in command, full command,

00:48:36.008 --> 00:48:43.062
full faith, actually the whole authority
comes to you through your faith

00:48:43.142 --> 00:48:47.995
which word is satta in Sanskrit, meaning the truth.

00:48:48.075 --> 00:48:52.062
The truth gives you the authority.
If you have the truth with you,

00:48:52.142 --> 00:48:55.494
you have the absolute truth with
you then you have the authority

00:48:55.574 --> 00:49:02.862
and the authority is such that that
authorizes you, not others, but to you.

00:49:02.942 --> 00:49:07.361
This authority that you have works and works.

00:49:07.441 --> 00:49:11.561
I've seen with simple Sahaja
Yogis, very simple uneducated also,

00:49:11.641 --> 00:49:16.828
are very powerful Sahaja Yogis,
are very powerful Sahaja Yogis.

00:49:16.908 --> 00:49:21.428
But they have one thing, is faith, complete faith.

00:49:21.508 --> 00:49:27.361
Then another word in Sanskrit is titiksha, means patience,

00:49:27.441 --> 00:49:32.962
saburi - patience. You must have patience.

00:49:33.042 --> 00:49:35.962
If you don't have patience, you want
immediately something to be done.

00:49:36.042 --> 00:49:38.761
How will you see the whole thing working out?

00:49:38.841 --> 00:49:46.595
Many people are extremely jittery and very fast-running.

00:49:46.675 --> 00:49:52.695
This world is running so fast and
you are the ones who have stood out

00:49:52.775 --> 00:49:56.394
and watching this rat race. You are not one of them.

00:49:56.474 --> 00:50:00.728
So must have titiksha, means you must have patience.

00:50:00.808 --> 00:50:05.394
So you must have faith in yourself fully and also patience,

00:50:05.474 --> 00:50:11.561
how Sahaja Yoga is working out or
how this Paramchaitanya is working out.

00:50:11.641 --> 00:50:15.828
If it works this way, all right, that
way, all right. It is some meaning.

00:50:15.908 --> 00:50:22.528
If it works this way, there's some
meaning. If it is that way it has some meaning.

00:50:22.608 --> 00:50:31.828
Now the another thing which is
important is the faith in your guru.

00:50:31.908 --> 00:50:38.761
If you have faith in your guru,
Paramchaitanya is kind to you.

00:50:38.841 --> 00:50:44.494
It’s very helpful. But if you doubt,
then Paramchaitanya also doubts you

00:50:44.574 --> 00:50:47.962
because Paramchaitanya knows you through your guru,

00:50:48.042 --> 00:50:53.062
whether it is Me or any other real guru, it’s the same.

00:50:53.142 --> 00:50:57.162
But with Me, of course, because,
you know, I’m very forgiving

00:50:57.242 --> 00:51:03.428
so people start taking liberties. With
another guru, you see, he will beat them.

00:51:03.508 --> 00:51:07.962
He’ll do all kinds of horrible
things to you if you are not there.

00:51:08.042 --> 00:51:11.028
So I’ve told you many stories
about the gurus, how they treat -

00:51:11.108 --> 00:51:14.828
good gurus - their disciples. But I forgive.

00:51:14.908 --> 00:51:17.895
I don’t say anything. Let it be, it doesn’t matter.

00:51:17.975 --> 00:51:21.095
Because I think by leaving them alone only they will rise

00:51:21.175 --> 00:51:23.528
and they will come up to this stage.

00:51:23.608 --> 00:51:27.828
But it happens sometimes that
it may work the other way round,

00:51:27.908 --> 00:51:36.761
that if they are forgiven, then
they take it for granted. It's all right.

00:51:36.841 --> 00:51:40.162
There is freedom, you can take it
for granted, you can do what you like.

00:51:40.242 --> 00:51:45.162
You can get lost, you can... I have nothing to say.

00:51:45.242 --> 00:51:50.062
So the faith in yourself is with patience you watch

00:51:50.142 --> 00:51:54.394
and do not get disappointed with anything whatsoever.

00:51:54.474 --> 00:51:57.895
Now, just imagine so many people have got realization,

00:51:57.975 --> 00:52:00.895
so many saints in this world, have you seen?

00:52:00.975 --> 00:52:05.628
Yesterday I was surprised the
way the French were singing so well.

00:52:05.708 --> 00:52:08.428
You know, first time I had to take a harmonium

00:52:08.508 --> 00:52:14.841
to teach them how to sing one
line. Half an hour I tried, I couldn’t do.

00:52:16.675 --> 00:52:21.528
The same French have reached that state of creativity.

00:52:21.608 --> 00:52:26.862
You see, all your potential
will rise. It will express itself,

00:52:26.942 --> 00:52:30.928
but be careful not to get into ego about it.

00:52:31.008 --> 00:52:35.728
Gradually it will flower and others who are surrounding you

00:52:35.808 --> 00:52:39.561
will get the fragrance of it and
they’ll come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:52:39.641 --> 00:52:44.862
That is the blessing at that time,
the blessing of the real Divine will be

00:52:44.942 --> 00:52:51.995
that you’ll be raised to the state which
we call as a perfect, ‘purnatva’, complete.

00:52:52.075 --> 00:52:56.595
That completeness will come. But you judge yourself.

00:52:56.675 --> 00:53:04.128
Are you absolutely one with Sahaj?
Are you absolutely dedicated to Sahaj?

00:53:04.208 --> 00:53:10.875
Or other things are more important to
you than Sahaja Yoga? Then, go ahead.

00:53:13.841 --> 00:53:17.995
There is something to be understood very clearly

00:53:18.075 --> 00:53:21.695
that there’s no competition in Sahaja Yoga. Cannot be.

00:53:21.775 --> 00:53:28.828
There’s no competition. There’s no
envy, there is no back biting, nothing.

00:53:28.908 --> 00:53:32.394
It is, you are different people. You are saints.

00:53:32.474 --> 00:53:38.761
Your style is different. You are
absolutely above all these things.

00:53:38.841 --> 00:53:43.461
You cannot be dishonest, you
cannot cheat people, you cannot do this.

00:53:43.541 --> 00:53:47.761
And if you are doing that, even
now, then please try to understand

00:53:47.841 --> 00:53:52.361
that you have still to grow into it.

00:53:52.441 --> 00:53:56.928
Some big people think they are very high up in Sahaja Yoga.

00:53:57.008 --> 00:54:01.428
It’s not so, it’s not so.

00:54:01.508 --> 00:54:08.474
If by thinking what you are, then you are lost.

00:54:09.108 --> 00:54:13.561
What you have to do is to understand “What have I done?

00:54:13.641 --> 00:54:18.595
How many people have I given realization,
to how many people have talked about it?”

00:54:18.675 --> 00:54:21.561
People are shy, even, to talk about Sahaja Yoga.

00:54:21.641 --> 00:54:24.928
I have seen one lady was traveling
with Me. Very hot. I said, “Ba, ba

00:54:25.008 --> 00:54:28.728
who is she, this one? I don’t know.”
So she told Me the name of her guru.

00:54:28.808 --> 00:54:32.128
She said, “My guru is like this, guru like that, like that.”

00:54:32.208 --> 00:54:36.561
I said, “My God, this heat coming out of
this woman and she’s talking so much.”

00:54:36.641 --> 00:54:40.962
But a Sahaja Yogi will not tell anybody what is Sahaja Yoga.

00:54:41.042 --> 00:54:45.528
They feel shy. They’ll have a hundred
friends, they’ll meet a hundred friends

00:54:45.608 --> 00:54:49.795
but they will never tell them what
Sahaja Yoga is. They’ll be shy to tell them.

00:54:49.875 --> 00:54:53.828
Ah, they wouldn’t mind going to
parties, you see, if the others are drinking,

00:54:53.908 --> 00:54:57.761
they’ll say, “All right, I don’t drink.”
But they’ll not say, “I’m a Sahaja Yogi,

00:54:57.841 --> 00:55:03.728
I cannot drink, by nature I cannot
drink.” They will not say that.

00:55:03.808 --> 00:55:09.394
So this is the third point, one
has to know the announcement.

00:55:09.474 --> 00:55:13.095
You must have faith in yourself and you must announce.

00:55:13.175 --> 00:55:16.394
All the saints announced. They were killed for that,

00:55:16.474 --> 00:55:21.128
you saw how Socrates was given poison. Doesn’t matter.

00:55:21.208 --> 00:55:23.962
Nobody’s going to kill you now, in these modern times,

00:55:24.042 --> 00:55:26.062
there’s fundamental rights to exist.

00:55:26.142 --> 00:55:29.595
So nobody can kill you, take it
from Me, but you must announce.

00:55:29.675 --> 00:55:32.528
And the announcement should be with full faith

00:55:32.608 --> 00:55:38.628
and understanding about Sahaja Yoga, how important it is.

00:55:38.708 --> 00:55:44.628
The purpose is to transform the whole world.

00:55:44.708 --> 00:55:48.128
With your transformation the whole world transforms.

00:55:48.208 --> 00:55:54.795
It’s a very complicated thing, otherwise,
Sahaja Yoga is extremely complicated

00:55:54.875 --> 00:56:01.695
because how it works. The other day, you
remember, the mike had failed completely

00:56:01.775 --> 00:56:06.461
and I was giving the lecture and still I was talking.

00:56:06.541 --> 00:56:12.428
The mike had failed but everybody
was listening to Me. What had happened?

00:56:12.508 --> 00:56:16.494
Did I enter into the ether? What happened? I don’t know.

00:56:16.574 --> 00:56:20.862
I didn’t even know that mike had
failed. I was thinking there is mike,

00:56:20.942 --> 00:56:24.361
that the way people were listening to Me,

00:56:24.441 --> 00:56:28.361
but then they told that half lecture was without the mike.

00:56:28.441 --> 00:56:34.428
And everybody was absolutely listening to Me.

00:56:34.508 --> 00:56:45.828
You see, it is something that
one has to wonder and appreciate

00:56:45.908 --> 00:56:49.361
what things are happening now, where are we going.

00:56:49.441 --> 00:56:52.528
We are going into the Kingdom of God

00:56:52.608 --> 00:56:56.928
and all the blessings, all the bliss will be on you.

00:56:57.008 --> 00:57:04.628
Then this bliss, knowledge, everything
becomes one, nothing but bliss

00:57:04.708 --> 00:57:12.028
and you are in that state of bliss which
you don’t even know, we are just there.

00:57:12.108 --> 00:57:18.162
The greatest bliss is that you don’t
know even anything, you’re just there.

00:57:18.242 --> 00:57:23.494
I hope all of you achieve that state
with this Diwali being done in Portugal,

00:57:23.574 --> 00:57:27.028
which is a special place, I think, of Mahalakshmi

00:57:27.108 --> 00:57:32.128
because She appeared here as they
say and also this swayambhu that we have,

00:57:32.208 --> 00:57:37.628
also is that of Mahalakshmi face, so
I’m sure it will work out for all of you.

00:57:37.708 --> 00:57:44.795
It’s a little subtle state I’m talking
about but it is, I have to tell you,

00:57:44.875 --> 00:57:47.995
that one has to rise up to that state

00:57:48.075 --> 00:57:52.962
and that state is very, very easy to achieve for you.

00:57:53.042 --> 00:57:56.795
It slowly, gradually it - then
you don’t have to do anything,

00:57:56.875 --> 00:58:00.661
you go into a village and everything
would be there. See, now, what happened.

00:58:00.741 --> 00:58:06.028
I went to Cairo. Everybody was saluting Me. I
was wondering, what has happened to them?

00:58:06.108 --> 00:58:09.461
I went to Leningrad, thousands came to My program.

00:58:09.541 --> 00:58:11.962
I asked them, “How did you come to My program?” They said,

00:58:12.042 --> 00:58:15.628
“It’s obvious from Your face, it’s obvious.”

00:58:15.708 --> 00:58:18.761
They just saw a small, little
advertisement in the newspaper,

00:58:18.841 --> 00:58:23.628
“It’s obvious that You are Divine.” That should happen.

00:58:23.708 --> 00:58:29.028
And then you can announce that Sahaja
Yoga is the only way, then you can announce.

00:58:29.108 --> 00:58:34.528
There’s no harm. People feel very shy to
say something to their friends and things.

00:58:34.608 --> 00:58:38.561
And you must know that all of
those who you love, who you know,

00:58:38.641 --> 00:58:42.695
will go to hell or where -
they’ll hang in the limbo or what?

00:58:42.775 --> 00:58:45.728
If you have achieved it you should pull them out also.

00:58:45.808 --> 00:58:49.661
They may not. They may not be seekers, doesn’t matter now.

00:58:49.741 --> 00:58:52.661
I think we are finished with the seekers now, must be -

00:58:52.741 --> 00:58:58.561
we must have people who are
not so seeking, it looks like that.

00:58:58.641 --> 00:59:02.108
So, may God bless you all.
