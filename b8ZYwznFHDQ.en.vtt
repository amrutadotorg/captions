00:00:06.033 --> 00:00:10.682
Are we our Guru or not?

00:00:11.541 --> 00:00:18.122
Because, before this your mind was on one side

00:00:18.202 --> 00:00:28.168
and your heart was on another side

00:00:28.248 --> 00:00:33.914
and your attention was in another dimension.

00:00:33.994 --> 00:00:40.553
So these three things were creating confusion within you.

00:00:48.928 --> 00:00:56.088
If you understand a human being, then you will be surprised to see

00:00:56.168 --> 00:01:04.747
how these three things act separately in a human being. And sometimes they fight also.

00:01:04.827 --> 00:01:09.096
First is your intellect and your mind.

00:01:09.176 --> 00:01:15.967
Second is your heart, your feelings, your emotions.

00:01:23.962 --> 00:01:32.376
And the third one is your attention.

00:01:34.184 --> 00:01:40.174
In these modern times, this confusion is the worst

00:01:40.254 --> 00:01:44.723
because all the time your attention is outside.

00:01:44.803 --> 00:01:51.764
It could be towards beautiful things, or beautiful women, or beautiful men or

00:01:51.844 --> 00:01:58.393
all kinds of nonsensical way of wasting your energy.

00:01:58.473 --> 00:02:04.655
Such attention then is absolutely like a horse which is let loose.

00:02:04.735 --> 00:02:07.918
You cannot control such an attention.

00:02:07.998 --> 00:02:15.885
And this attention runs wild from one to another.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.073
It’s a fashion also. It’s sort of a very popular thing

00:02:20.153 --> 00:02:24.535
to keep the attention moving all the time.

00:02:24.615 --> 00:02:30.578
But this attention that has to be towards the Divine,

00:02:30.658 --> 00:02:39.088
towards the Almighty, is just being frittered away.

00:02:39.168 --> 00:02:45.959
Thus, attention doesn’t grow its own roots.

00:02:47.633 --> 00:02:53.242
First is to find out about yourself: where does your attention go?

00:02:53.322 --> 00:03:06.167
What makes you feel like looking after or concerned for attention?

00:03:06.247 --> 00:03:11.171
You see, the attention comes from various problems,

00:03:11.251 --> 00:03:21.618
and could be your upbringing where you are not controlled,

00:03:25.845 --> 00:03:35.958
could be your education, could be your atmosphere in which you live

00:03:36.038 --> 00:03:41.810
or could be your own ego or your conditioning.

00:03:43.588 --> 00:03:51.629
So, this attention is being attacked

00:03:52.160 --> 00:04:03.778
by all these outside energies or negative forces

00:04:04.108 --> 00:04:11.478
and it gets entangled - like a river flowing

00:04:11.558 --> 00:04:20.850
straight into the ocean can get lost in a barren place.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:30.754
In the same way this attention, which has to go towards the Divine,

00:04:30.834 --> 00:04:35.053
gets frittered away and is vanished...

00:04:35.133 --> 00:04:41.577
This weak attention cannot take you towards the Divine.

00:04:41.657 --> 00:04:48.396
Ultimately you find that all this attention is being completely

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:56.251
absorbed or frittered away by the nonsense that’s going on.

00:04:56.331 --> 00:05:01.915
Unfortunately or fortunately, you are born in these modern times,

00:05:01.995 --> 00:05:07.267
and in these modern times, as you know, it's a very chaotic condition.

00:05:07.347 --> 00:05:12.468
In these chaotic conditions, you don’t know what is right and what is wrong.

00:05:12.548 --> 00:05:18.046
And there are all kinds of attractions,

00:05:18.126 --> 00:05:27.041
which can take away your attention and reduce the energy of your attention.

00:05:28.173 --> 00:05:35.836
It is possible more for the people who are very right-sided.

00:05:35.916 --> 00:05:39.795
Also the left-sided people can be very much affected.

00:05:39.875 --> 00:05:45.603
Right-sided people, as you know, go up to a point and become extremely dry,

00:05:45.683 --> 00:05:53.204
self-opinionated and aggressive. All their attention is in aggression,

00:05:53.284 --> 00:05:59.492
while the people who are on the left side are indulging too much

00:05:59.572 --> 00:06:07.091
into their own whims and their desires and their own temptations.

00:06:07.171 --> 00:06:11.440
Both sides can fritter away your attention

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:18.408
which is the most important thing. It is the most valuable thing is your attention.

00:06:18.488 --> 00:06:23.237
But the attention cannot be controlled by a person

00:06:23.317 --> 00:06:31.149
who doesn't have a weak mind or a weak heart.

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:36.125
Now supposing you take somebody who is a very intelligent person.

00:06:36.205 --> 00:06:40.366
The intelligent person puts all his attention

00:06:40.446 --> 00:06:44.673
in capturing the attention of others.

00:06:44.753 --> 00:06:49.551
I don't know why, but it’s a kind of a paradox.

00:06:49.631 --> 00:06:59.700
The person who himself is having such a lot of aggressiveness and all that,

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:04.070
tries to be very sweet, tries to be very nice with people

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:12.805
just to keep good relations or, we can say, the good behavior

00:07:12.885 --> 00:07:18.103
towards people so that they pay attention to that person.

00:07:18.183 --> 00:07:22.253
This is a very subtle thing. They are not even aware about it,

00:07:22.333 --> 00:07:30.391
that we do such a thing just to make others pay attention to us.

00:07:30.471 --> 00:07:34.195
That is how we have seen that in these modern times

00:07:34.275 --> 00:07:40.084
so many stupid things people do just to attract the attention of others.

00:07:40.164 --> 00:07:49.065
Most of the fads that had come up in modern times

00:07:49.145 --> 00:07:55.291
are just to make something stupid so that people should pay attention to them.
