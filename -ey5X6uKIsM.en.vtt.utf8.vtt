00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:59.780
Today 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:03:22.859
is 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:13:12.649
the day we 

00:13:12.649 --> 00:20:02.830
are celebrating Easter.

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:17.820
Easter is extremely symbolic, of - not only
of Christ, but also for all of us.

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:31.299
In that the most important day is that of
resurrection.

00:20:31.299 --> 00:20:47.289
The resurrection of Christ has 
the message of Christianity, not the cross.

00:20:47.289 --> 00:21:01.269
Through resurrection Christ had shown that
one can be resurrected with the body that

00:21:01.269 --> 00:21:07.640
you have.

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:18.950
And without His resurrection, we could not
have managed the crossing of Agnya chakra,

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:23.230
no doubt.

00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:36.620
His life was very short of, we can say three
and half years only, He lived there.

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:47.049
He came to India and He met Shalivahana, and
Shalivahana asked His name.

00:21:47.049 --> 00:21:48.440
He told him His name was Isa Masih.

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:57.000
But He said, "I am coming from the country
where there are malichchas, mala-ichchha.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:08.289
They have ichchha of mal, desire to get dirty,
and I don't know how to live there.

00:22:08.289 --> 00:22:10.770
To Me, this is My country."

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:21.799
But Shalivahana said that, "You should go
back and save Your people and give them Parama

00:22:21.799 --> 00:22:23.920
Nirmala Tattwam.

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:34.000
So He went back, and as it is, within three
and half years He was crucified.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:44.600
At the time of His death He said so many beautiful
things for forgiveness, but ultimately He

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:48.940
said "Behold the Mother."

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:53.680
That means you should hope for the Mother.

00:22:53.680 --> 00:23:04.649
And in His lifetime He also said that, "I'll
send you the Holy Ghost Who will comfort you,

00:23:04.649 --> 00:23:11.519
counsel you and also redeem", means resurrect
you.

00:23:11.519 --> 00:23:20.890
All these things He had said it because He
knew what was the whole plan.

00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:29.820
Also He said that, "You may say anything against
Me or do anything against Me, but anything

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:37.159
against the Holy Ghost I will not tolerate.

00:23:37.159 --> 00:23:42.010
I will not tolerate at any cost."

00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:51.250
Which is true also, so it is very dangerous
also to go against the Holy Ghost.

00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:53.450
No doubt about it.

00:23:53.450 --> 00:24:01.309
It's not Me that is dangerous, but these Deities
are extremely dangerous.

00:24:01.309 --> 00:24:11.600
So, in Sahaja Yoga you are all resurrected
with your body.

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:19.600
Before this you were not connected to the
All Pervading Power, and whatever you did

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:25.720
was through your mind or through your emotions.

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:44.210
But you did not come out of that grave of
emotions and your desires, your actions and

00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:48.769
your ego.

00:24:48.769 --> 00:24:54.570
After realization now you know how free you
have become.

00:24:54.570 --> 00:25:08.169
How you have developed your own personality.

00:25:08.169 --> 00:25:20.039
There are so many instances which we can talk
about Christ, that He said, "Know Thyself"

00:25:20.039 --> 00:25:21.149
throughout.

00:25:21.149 --> 00:25:25.081
He knew without knowing yourself, you won't
be resurrected.

00:25:25.081 --> 00:25:29.929
But Sahaja Yoga is the other way round.

00:25:29.929 --> 00:25:35.790
You get your resurrection and you know yourself.

00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:44.399
It's a very Sahaja, sweet way of getting realization.

00:25:44.399 --> 00:25:53.029
But if you see to the life of Christ, He has
talked about murmuring souls.

00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:59.720
We too have in Sahaja Yoga, because it's open
to everyone, all kinds of people come.

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:10.470
We find very shallow people coming to Sahaja
Yoga who try to express their shallowness

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:25.850
and talk in a very, in a very loose way, about
Sahaja Yoga, about the work of Sahaja Yoga.

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:34.120
So that was inevitable, but what Christ has
said that you have to be careful about the

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:37.070
murmuring souls.

00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:40.970
And this is exactly - we have to be very careful.

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:48.100
When you come to Sahaja Yoga, in the beginning,
you may come across such people who are murmuring

00:26:48.100 --> 00:27:01.750
souls, you may be enticed by them because
they are a kind of, we should say, messengers

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:04.440
of negative forces.

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:10.080
And these messengers of negative forces, you
should try to find out.

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:16.529
They'll complain about this, complain about
that, they talk in a very loose manner, and

00:27:16.529 --> 00:27:29.840
when you see that they are not talking in
a positive way, you should run away from them.

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:36.309
Because only by getting your resurrection
you are not all right.

00:27:36.309 --> 00:27:42.340
After getting your resurrection, after your
Self-realization, you have to grow.

00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:52.240
And for that growth we have to be very careful
about how we get impressed by all these, I

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:56.139
should say, very frivolous people.

00:27:56.139 --> 00:28:02.690
Those who grow into it become beautiful angels.

00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:05.179
No doubt about that.

00:28:05.179 --> 00:28:11.400
But that is one thing one has to know is to
respect your Self-realization.

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:16.340
You shouldn't worry about what others are
talking, what others are saying, what they

00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:24.159
are criticizing, but you should look at yourself
and all the time try to grow into your depth.

00:28:24.159 --> 00:28:30.100
It's a very great chance of life that you
are being resurrected, and this is the last

00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:33.529
breakthrough, as you know, of our evolution.

00:28:33.529 --> 00:28:39.970
But now you should leave your mind on one
side; because this mind, if you go on working

00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:48.399
with it, you cannot go beyond mind and Sahaja
Yoga you can achieve by going beyond your

00:28:48.399 --> 00:28:49.740
mind.

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:54.990
Then you know yourself, because you get Self-knowledge.

00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:57.649
You know about your centers.

00:28:57.649 --> 00:28:59.899
You know about the centers of others.

00:28:59.899 --> 00:29:08.440
All this is available to you, but you have
to become a subtler and subtler person.

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:09.509
Not a gross personality.

00:29:09.509 --> 00:29:19.080
If you become subtler and subtler, you will
be amazed how you will develop your inner

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:24.510
powers in so many different ways.

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:30.490
But there are people in Sahaja Yoga, I have
seen, who are very ambitious.

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:36.350
And they start saying that, "Mother, we want
to be God realized.

00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:39.039
I want to be this and do that."

00:29:39.039 --> 00:29:46.180
There is no office going on here that you
give somebody a promotion.

00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:48.520
You have to grow yourself.

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:53.030
Then they start proclaiming, "I am this, I
am that."

00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:55.179
We call them 'Mahayogis'.

00:29:55.179 --> 00:30:00.529
Some of them had started saying that they
have reached very high positions and they

00:30:00.529 --> 00:30:05.049
ended up in the lunatic asylum.

00:30:05.049 --> 00:30:13.669
All such suggestions if people give you, then
you should shun such people.

00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:20.620
But there are also other people who join such
a bombastic fellow.

00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:30.179
So, you must remember that this last judgment
is working and all the time there is a big

00:30:30.179 --> 00:30:41.510
sieving out, a very big arrangement of choices.

00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:47.009
Those who are subtle, start getting subtler
and subtler and subtler.

00:30:47.009 --> 00:30:57.220
But those who are frivolous, gross, idiotic,
stupid, they start frittering away.

00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:06.929
So this last sieving starts very fast, working
out where we realize that where are we.

00:31:06.929 --> 00:31:11.460
Now what is the criteria for that?

00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:19.190
First is your compassion.

00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:26.279
Your compassion must be discrete.

00:31:26.279 --> 00:31:30.830
Sometimes people only have compassion for
negative people.

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:39.840
After Sahaja Yoga you should know for whom
you should have your compassion.

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:47.460
With vibrations you can find out, very easy
to find out with vibrations - what sort of

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:49.570
a person you are facing.

00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:53.299
But first you must have vibratory awareness.

00:31:53.299 --> 00:32:05.990
If you don't have vibratory awareness, you
won't be able to find out at all what is correct

00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:07.929
and what is incorrect.

00:32:07.929 --> 00:32:14.630
So it is important that you all must mediate.

00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:19.200
Without criticizing yourself, anything, you
can just meditate everyday.

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:20.760
Is very important!

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:29.259
I immediately know who is the person who is
meditating and who is not meditating.

00:32:29.259 --> 00:32:30.259
Immediately!

00:32:30.259 --> 00:32:39.720
The person who meditates is very clearly an
angel.

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:51.629
The whole reaction, the whole behavior, the
whole attitude of such spiritual maturity

00:32:51.629 --> 00:32:52.629
manifests.

00:32:52.629 --> 00:32:57.809
And you are amazed.

00:32:57.809 --> 00:33:01.690
As you know Sahasrare Mahamaya.

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:04.850
It's not easy to understand Me.

00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:10.990
For the time being you might know what I am,
but suddenly you will forget.

00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:14.659
That's the trick.

00:33:14.659 --> 00:33:20.590
Because if you know Me in full ways, you won't
even sit here.

00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:24.450
You won't even come nearer to Me.

00:33:24.450 --> 00:33:33.250
So that Mahamaya is acting all the time, but
that's the only way you can judge people.

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:37.190
This last judgment is not a easy thing.

00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:41.510
Even if you put thousands of judges, they
cannot do this judgment.

00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:49.509
All the time you have to know what is what.

00:33:49.509 --> 00:33:56.640
And somehow I know everything, but I will
never show that I know.

00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:07.820
That's how I work it out, and gradually I
know what I have to do about that person.

00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:14.680
This resurrection of yours is much more blessed
than that of Christ.

00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:18.570
He was alone; people wouldn't recognize Him.

00:34:18.570 --> 00:34:26.550
He had to show His marks where they had put
nails on His hands and feet.

00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:30.280
But today that is not the situation.

00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:36.570
Only thing is, first of all you have to recognize
Me.

00:34:36.570 --> 00:34:38.040
That's all.

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:40.139
Need not know Me.

00:34:40.139 --> 00:34:41.139
It's not easy.

00:34:41.139 --> 00:34:47.780
It's difficult to know Me, but if you recognize
Me, that's all.

00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:50.940
And it all depends on your sensitivity.

00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:59.390
Your resurrection has to be complete and you
have to mature in Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:59.390 --> 00:35:05.480
If you cannot mature, I will say you should
leave Sahaja Yoga.

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:14.940
Go out for a while, where you will understand
what's going on, then you'll come back.

00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:26.470
In Sahaja Yoga, like Christ sacrificed His
life, is not expected of you to sacrifice

00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:27.470
your life.

00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:29.710
Your Mother doesn't want that.

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:40.589
But you have to do some sacrifices, like you
have to stay in uncomfortable places in Ganapatipule

00:35:40.589 --> 00:35:43.490
sometimes, or somewhere.

00:35:43.490 --> 00:35:54.309
You have to face many odds while traveling,
also coming down here may not be so comfortable

00:35:54.309 --> 00:35:58.030
as you are at your place.

00:35:58.030 --> 00:36:03.250
But the main sacrifice is of your ego.

00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:05.309
You have to crucify your ego.

00:36:05.309 --> 00:36:15.020
The ego is the one, which teaches you all
these nonsensical tantrums that people know.

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:27.450
If you can surrender your ego - just surrender
your ego - that surrendering can help you.

00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:36.700
But if you surrender your ego by thinking
about it, then you are using your mental capacity.

00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:44.130
Everything you do like that is through your
mental capacity, by which you are using your

00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:46.410
ego.

00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:54.360
So the best way is to meditate, to go into
thoughtless awareness and there automatically

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:56.790
you are surrendered.

00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:59.410
Now what do I have to have from you?

00:36:59.410 --> 00:37:00.410
Nothing!

00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:01.410
I don't want anything.

00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:03.420
I don't want to have anything.

00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:06.790
You are the ones who try to give Me this and
give Me that.

00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:09.750
I am trying to run away from all that.

00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:15.359
Just for your satisfaction also, I agree.

00:37:15.359 --> 00:37:23.310
I don't have to do Sahaja Yoga Myself, but
that's the love of your Mother.

00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:32.569
That She wants to save as many as possible
- all that are created on this Earth - to

00:37:32.569 --> 00:37:34.420
give them their resurrection.

00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:38.619
This is a special time and you are My channels.

00:37:38.619 --> 00:37:47.829
You can go all over and spread Sahaja Yoga
and try to help others to come out of it.

00:37:47.829 --> 00:37:55.990
Today is a day of promises, where we have
to promise ourselves that we'll grow in a

00:37:55.990 --> 00:38:08.280
very deeper understanding, or feeling, or
in sensitiveness of Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:15.750
This growth has to take place for which I
have to meditate.

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:18.329
This is a very important thing.

00:38:18.329 --> 00:38:24.609
Secondly, people say that here people are
very miserly.

00:38:24.609 --> 00:38:27.770
They are not willing to do this.

00:38:27.770 --> 00:38:32.630
They don't want to pay any money for this,
pay any money for that.

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:36.390
I think generosity is one expression of your
love.

00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:38.550
You will give Me, all right.

00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:45.880
When it comes to expenses, either I pay or
somebody bears the burden.

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:54.160
Now things have improved, but still we should
know that this tremendous work has to be done

00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:56.510
and we need money for that.

00:38:56.510 --> 00:39:00.190
I don't need, I spend My own money.

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:11.140
But generosity is the best and this generosity
is very, very important for Sahaja Yogis.

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:16.780
I have seen people are very meticulous sometimes,
very calculating.

00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:20.950
They will tell Me, "Bring some sarees for
them."

00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:23.599
Take some sarees, all right, very good idea.

00:39:23.599 --> 00:39:26.860
And they say, "We don't like it, we don't
want to buy."

00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:28.980
I am not doing any business.

00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:32.620
I buy it because you wanted, I have selected
it.

00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:35.450
Then to say, "we don't want to have it."

00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:39.869
There's no business, there's no marketing
going on.

00:39:39.869 --> 00:39:47.020
And this is the problem when I don't understand
Sahaja Yogis that they should know Mother,

00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:49.720
Herself, has put in Her money.

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:56.599
So what is there also, they should say, "take
little more for Sahaja Yoga."

00:39:56.599 --> 00:40:02.500
After all such a big organization going on,
and there are so many countries who cannot

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:07.450
pay a single farthing, for them also one has
to pay.

00:40:07.450 --> 00:40:11.120
Now, Christ was sold for thirty rubles.

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:16.670
You can imagine, He was sold for thirty rubles.

00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:25.839
So that shows that when you do not try to
understand the financial difficulties of the

00:40:25.839 --> 00:40:34.270
organizers and you do not help, you are really
selling the Christ within you.

00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:42.329
You cannot sell Christ, you cannot sell Sahaja
Yoga.

00:40:42.329 --> 00:40:45.850
But that doesn't mean you exploit it.

00:40:45.850 --> 00:40:51.890
So I have to tell you that I was Myself surprised
in north India where I least expected people

00:40:51.890 --> 00:40:56.599
are extremely generous, extremely generous.

00:40:56.599 --> 00:41:08.690
And then generosity helps you, in a way that
our Lakshmi Tatwa is to be awakened.

00:41:08.690 --> 00:41:15.260
I had to bring in this point because I have
complaints from people that people are reluctant

00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:20.730
to pay for anything like this.

00:41:20.730 --> 00:41:28.839
It's very remarkable that some people take
over, but everybody must contribute.

00:41:28.839 --> 00:41:34.079
It's important, because you are doing God's
work.

00:41:34.079 --> 00:41:39.859
You have to also come forward to do other
things that are there without grudging.

00:41:39.859 --> 00:41:40.940
Enjoying it!

00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:48.410
I was happy the posters were put by the Sahaja
Yogis, and you can see the whole place vibrated.

00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:53.099
You could see how it has worked out.

00:41:53.099 --> 00:42:00.030
So everybody must go all out to do everything
that is possible.

00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:07.549
Nothing else is needed but your full heart
into Sahaja Yoga.

00:42:07.549 --> 00:42:09.570
Then you will see how you will grow.

00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:16.020
It is only through your heart you will receive
all your nourishment for your spirituality.

00:42:16.020 --> 00:46:31.490
So open 

00:46:31.490 --> 01:52:22.559
your heart, do 
not calculate so much.
