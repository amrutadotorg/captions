THE GUIDANCE OF A MOTHER

00:00:25.506 --> 00:00:30.898
Seeker: Does Mother have a guru and
what point did She gain Self-realization?

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.381
Sahaja Yogi: Do you have a guru and at
what stage did You receive Self-realization?

00:00:35.608 --> 00:00:38.389
Shri Mataji: I neither have a guru
nor I want you to have a guru.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.772
You’d better become your own gurus.

00:00:40.973 --> 00:00:45.545
Secondly, I’ve been born like that,
I never got any realization or anything.

00:00:45.746 --> 00:00:49.764
I just got realization, I should say
human realization when I understood

00:00:49.965 --> 00:00:51.748
what was the problem with human beings.

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:55.264
I worked on the all permutations and
combinations of human beings,

00:00:55.465 --> 00:00:57.905
because I wanted to have an en-masse
media,

00:00:58.106 --> 00:01:00.991
by which I could give realization
to thousands of people.

00:01:01.192 --> 00:01:05.342
Because any discovery which is made
and is not brought to that level

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.748
it is absolutely detrimental to the growth.

00:01:11.957 --> 00:01:17.763
For example, you see, Jesus was crucified.
Why? Because He was alone!

00:01:17.964 --> 00:01:21.625
Only for His mother, nobody knew
what He was.

00:01:21.826 --> 00:01:27.018
At that time He could not achieve this,
because you all were not there at the time.

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:30.622
And also other people –

00:01:30.823 --> 00:01:34.461
you know how the saints have suffered,
how every prophet has suffered

00:01:34.662 --> 00:01:39.253
because they could not create a mass
understanding of it.

00:01:39.454 --> 00:01:42.992
So at a certain point it has to become
a mass thing.

00:01:43.193 --> 00:01:48.488
In the tree of life there are only three
or four flowers in the beginning,

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.523
but when it grows, when the blossom
time comes,

00:01:51.724 --> 00:01:56.735
then so many flowers are there and they
become the fruits.

00:01:56.936 --> 00:02:01.495
So I, I just saw that this is the time
I have to do this job.

00:02:01.696 --> 00:02:06.845
So you would call it My “human” realization
when I understood human beings.

00:02:07.046 --> 00:02:09.882
Of course even now sometimes I get
shocked the way they behave,

00:02:10.083 --> 00:02:16.182
I mean, I just don’t understand, but
I think now I understand them.

00:02:17.882 --> 00:02:21.284
Sahaja Yogi: So those people who can’t
quite understand that answer,

00:02:21.485 --> 00:02:23.213
don’t think about it too much.
Shri Mataji: There’s another gentleman

00:02:23.414 --> 00:02:26.087
who was asking a question. Sahaja Yogi:
Mother has to be somebody special,

00:02:26.288 --> 00:02:28.442
but find out for yourself. That’s
the best way.

00:02:28.643 --> 00:02:32.105
Shri Mataji: You don’t worry about Me,
you worry about yourself. Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

00:02:32.306 --> 00:02:35.014
Shri Mataji: I must be someone, all right.
Even if I’m not, doesn’t matter.

00:02:35.215 --> 00:02:37.317
If you are going to get it, why not
have it?

00:02:39.231 --> 00:02:41.530
Sahaja Yogi: Any questions?
Shri Mataji: Yes, My child?

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.053
Seeker: When I first learnt...
Excuse me?

00:02:46.254 --> 00:02:47.294
Shri Mataji: Little loud. You can... Seeker:
When I first learnt about Kundalini -

00:02:47.495 --> 00:02:58.075
a basic learning of that many years ago -
part of what I understood

00:02:58.276 --> 00:03:04.757
was that the Kundalini... you talked
about raising it spontaneously.

00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:09.710
Shri Mataji: Yes. Seeker: And what I had
understood was that you must always have

00:03:09.912 --> 00:03:14.318
a master to help you raise it,
that somewhere it isn't save,

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.938
I mean, psycologically or emotionally
to raise it yourself,

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:22.316
that you need the master to guide you.
Shri Mataji: Yes.

00:03:22.517 --> 00:03:25.496
Seeker: So I wanted to ask about the raising
of it spontaneously. Shri Mataji: Yes.

00:03:25.697 --> 00:03:28.452
She’s asking me if, that she’s read,
that you have to have a master,

00:03:28.653 --> 00:03:30.804
no doubt you have to have a master,
no doubt.

00:03:31.005 --> 00:03:33.760
Meaning the person who is
an enlightened soul.

00:03:33.961 --> 00:03:36.501
A person who is a realized soul can
only do it.

00:03:36.702 --> 00:03:39.551
I wish Jung knew how to do it; he would
have done it himself.

00:03:39.752 --> 00:03:42.619
So you have to have a master who is
called as a Sat Guru,

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.384
the one who has achieved the truth,
and who is a master.

00:03:46.585 --> 00:03:51.492
Now I’m not a master, thank God,
I am not a master at all, I am a Mother.

00:03:51.693 --> 00:03:56.195
And Mother is always a master in a way.
So that’s what it is.

00:03:56.396 --> 00:03:59.715
But as far as I’m concerned,

00:03:59.916 --> 00:04:06.215
I am too soft to be a master, I think,
because I cannot be hard with people.

00:04:06.749 --> 00:04:09.265
So that’s what it is. So you have
to have a master.

00:04:09.466 --> 00:04:13.738
But to get a master rather difficult,
better get a Mother.

00:04:14.327 --> 00:04:18.271
Shri Mataji: Yes. Seeker: When some
of the speekers have talked

00:04:18.472 --> 00:04:23.687
about the primordial masters,
they’re all male.

00:04:23.888 --> 00:04:28.281
They incarnated in male bodies
and I was wondering

00:04:28.482 --> 00:04:32.780
if there was a natural lineage or why
has that been over time, in history,

00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:36.921
just say Abraham, Moses,
Lao Tse, etc.

00:04:37.122 --> 00:04:40.515
Shri Mataji: You see, first we had
to build up the fatherhood,

00:04:40.716 --> 00:04:46.264
you see, out of fear, because without fear
human beings won’t listen.

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:51.054
Imagine at the time of Moses, the Ten
Commandments that he brought

00:04:51.255 --> 00:04:54.288
had to be chain, the people were
so horrid.

00:04:54.489 --> 00:04:57.170
He had to make them very, very strict
at that time

00:04:57.371 --> 00:04:59.991
you can see from the Books of Essenes, see,

00:05:00.192 --> 00:05:04.366
you'll get the full idea as to how
terrible the people were.

00:05:04.567 --> 00:05:12.022
Now, then we had to talk of Christ
because He had to cross the Agnya.

00:05:12.223 --> 00:05:17.317
He had to cross it because that was the
problem. That time the ego was too much.

00:05:17.518 --> 00:05:23.255
You see, imagine at the time of Romans how
they were horrid. So He had to do that job.

00:05:23.456 --> 00:05:26.544
Now, today we have reached at a point
fagged out absolutely,

00:05:26.745 --> 00:05:33.880
fed up of our egos, superegos, everything.
Now only the Mother can help you.

00:05:34.081 --> 00:05:37.911
So it has to be at different various
levels of your awareness

00:05:38.112 --> 00:05:42.950
one had to work out. Now is the time
of Mother to nourish you,

00:05:43.151 --> 00:05:45.414
is Mother to give you that love

00:05:45.615 --> 00:05:50.096
because you won’t be spoiled now any
more. That you will understand.

00:05:51.507 --> 00:05:59.140
The authority with which Moses talked,
authority with which Socrates talked,

00:05:59.341 --> 00:06:04.255
authority with which Lao Tse talked -

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:11.618
all these great Adi Gurus,

00:06:13.585 --> 00:06:18.396
from Adi Nath to Sai Nath,

00:06:20.604 --> 00:06:27.168
they didn't say, "If you do this way will
be good, or that way would be good."

00:06:27.369 --> 00:06:32.302
No, "This is what it is, you better do it!"

00:06:37.977 --> 00:06:40.982
This is what it is.

00:06:44.376 --> 00:06:52.685
But in modern times those gurus
may not work out.

00:06:53.811 --> 00:06:57.470
That's why a Mother had to come.

00:07:00.724 --> 00:07:04.880
First to give you realization.

00:07:07.092 --> 00:07:09.822
Because these gurus did not realize
another point:

00:07:10.023 --> 00:07:17.419
that their disciples not understand
them at all.

00:07:18.101 --> 00:07:22.554
Whatever they are doing, they are
doing out of awe.

00:07:22.755 --> 00:07:27.414
But awe doesn't have understanding in it.

00:07:29.309 --> 00:07:34.372
Or even the earlier ones may have had,

00:07:36.082 --> 00:07:40.348
the generation that came afterwards
did not have.

00:07:40.549 --> 00:07:46.653
So they turned the gurus into a façade

00:07:46.854 --> 00:07:51.700
and the whole building they owned
as their own.

00:07:53.033 --> 00:07:56.357
Creating all kinds of problems,

00:07:56.558 --> 00:08:01.587
killing the universality and
the collectivity

00:08:02.108 --> 00:08:10.927
because Brahma Tattwa is the power
of the collectivity.

00:08:13.155 --> 00:08:23.125
Is in everything - in the atom,
in the molecule, in the human heart.

00:08:23.326 --> 00:08:28.728
Everywhere it is reflected, depending
on the reflector.

00:08:28.929 --> 00:08:32.200
And it controls.

00:08:41.407 --> 00:08:45.868
This understanding they had,

00:08:46.053 --> 00:08:50.118
but the human understanding perhaps
they did not have.

00:08:50.319 --> 00:08:53.790
That if you today tell them something
they might listen to us,

00:08:53.991 --> 00:08:55.766
but tomorrow they will forget.

00:08:55.967 --> 00:09:01.195
So, it was necessary that you all should
be given realization.

00:09:02.133 --> 00:09:07.490
Otherwise, also without realization,
what's the use?

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:15.599
What's the use of talking to people about
the colors, those who don't have eyes?

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.404
So realization has to be given.

00:09:19.448 --> 00:09:22.310
So the first and foremost thing we have
to know

00:09:22.511 --> 00:09:28.583
that this Sahaja Yoga has worked out
because Paramchaitanya

00:09:28.784 --> 00:09:33.435
is transmitting compassion. It never
did before.

00:09:33.636 --> 00:09:42.091
It never had that kind of an attitude which
it is there because I am a Mother.

00:09:42.299 --> 00:09:47.576
And this compassion has worked it this way
that: you all have got your realization,

00:09:47.777 --> 00:09:53.107
you have achieved a state which we can
call as a Self-realised souls.

00:09:53.308 --> 00:10:00.669
But still, because you got it so easily,
cheaply,

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:06.073
I think still we don’t realise what we
have got.

00:10:06.274 --> 00:10:11.417
Still we do not practice meditation,

00:10:11.618 --> 00:10:18.831
introspection and dedication.
Some are very much there...

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:24.034
Many people tell Me: “Mother, people had
to do so much: to go to Himalayas,

00:10:24.235 --> 00:10:27.988
do this, do that, and then they got
their realization.

00:10:28.189 --> 00:10:33.753
How is it these people you have blessed?”.
Even some great saints asked Me that.

00:10:33.954 --> 00:10:37.417
“What right they had to get this
realization?

00:10:37.618 --> 00:10:41.238
Why did you give them realization?
What have they achieved?”.

00:10:41.439 --> 00:10:43.770
I said, “Only their desire.

00:10:43.971 --> 00:10:48.044
Their desire was very much there that
they should get their realization

00:10:48.245 --> 00:10:51.489
and that’s how they got it“.

00:10:51.731 --> 00:11:00.013
But now to go into only desire,
is not sufficient.

00:11:00.214 --> 00:11:03.278
You have to depend on yourself,

00:11:03.479 --> 00:11:07.200
on the light of your Spirit you should see
what’s wrong with you.

00:11:08.127 --> 00:11:12.231
I am supposed to be your Guru,

00:11:14.299 --> 00:11:22.419
but I feel sometimes that the idea
of a guru

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:27.544
is very different from Mine.

00:11:29.455 --> 00:11:35.320
Normally a guru is a very, very
strict person,

00:11:35.521 --> 00:11:39.810
and has no patience of any kind.

00:11:41.591 --> 00:11:53.185
So, there are two, three types of tests are
all the time taken off the disciple.

00:11:53.394 --> 00:11:58.982
Firstly how much they obey you.

00:12:02.057 --> 00:12:11.879
But as you all have got realization
and you are your own gurus,

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:17.380
I don't put that condition on you.

00:12:19.219 --> 00:12:26.502
I leave it to your freedom.
I tell you earnestly,

00:12:26.979 --> 00:12:33.143
in all the ways possible, what I think
good for you.

00:12:34.258 --> 00:12:39.370
But I don't compel

00:12:42.664 --> 00:12:47.042
like these gurus used to do. I mean,
they used to beat,

00:12:48.524 --> 00:12:52.463
they used to hang them on a well,

00:12:53.828 --> 00:12:56.854
they were so very strict

00:12:57.055 --> 00:13:01.971
with their disciples and I've had
an experience of this.

00:13:02.922 --> 00:13:08.120
They never used to smile, no question
of laughing,

00:13:09.999 --> 00:13:19.940
and would never show any kind of weakness,
of kindness for the disciples.

00:13:20.312 --> 00:13:24.221
You see a Guru has to be a very
angry person,

00:13:24.422 --> 00:13:30.690
wearing only single dress either upwards or
downwards - I don’t know how they wear -

00:13:33.055 --> 00:13:37.279
with a big thick rod in the hand,

00:13:37.774 --> 00:13:43.127
never smiling – laughing no question –
smiling.

00:13:43.328 --> 00:13:51.536
And the Gurus have to be very long faced,
developing big, big beards,

00:13:51.922 --> 00:13:55.760
and no ladies allowed.

00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:04.846
In such a situation, where the women
are not to be seen at all,

00:14:05.047 --> 00:14:10.479
I mean, I shouldn’t even see My face –
it’s like that.

00:14:14.429 --> 00:14:19.604
There is a big discussion in all
the scriptures -

00:14:19.805 --> 00:14:22.612
and not scriptures, I would say
the critiques -

00:14:22.813 --> 00:14:25.940
whether a woman should be
allowed

00:14:26.141 --> 00:14:34.223
to do the spiritual practices or not,
imagine.

00:14:36.242 --> 00:14:42.643
Not only among Christians, you’ll be
surprised, even in Indian scriptures –

00:14:42.844 --> 00:14:49.192
whether is woman should be allowed
or not to do spiritual practices.

00:14:49.547 --> 00:14:58.878
Now when your Mother is a woman
and She is your Guru, what will you do?

00:14:59.079 --> 00:15:07.236
This is another confusion because
it is wrong;

00:15:07.437 --> 00:15:14.656
the whole thing is falsehood, based
on no basis at all.

00:15:15.468 --> 00:15:19.843
You may try anything to say that
women

00:15:20.044 --> 00:15:26.914
are not meant for spiritual life,

00:15:27.903 --> 00:15:32.508
try any argument, it fails.

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:42.564
The whole thing has to be brought up
this way that everything faces reality.

00:15:42.765 --> 00:15:49.347
All these false ideas have to be
given up.

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:53.933
Like, if you have a carpet upside-down,
the whole design is upside-down.

00:15:54.134 --> 00:15:58.121
But, if you put the carpet right,
everything falls in line.

00:15:58.322 --> 00:16:04.350
And that’s why you needed a Mother
to give you realization,

00:16:04.558 --> 00:16:08.660
and a Guru as a Mother to teach you

00:16:08.861 --> 00:16:15.688
that for ascent of God nobody can
be prohibited.

00:16:16.437 --> 00:16:19.823
Sahaja Yoga is not a military thing,

00:16:20.024 --> 00:16:27.697
it’s just plain, simple, Mother’s love.

00:16:28.662 --> 00:16:34.204
And of course every mother wants
her child to be great,

00:16:34.405 --> 00:16:39.189
to have all her powers – she wants that,
no doubt.

00:16:40.108 --> 00:16:48.546
How she does it, how she works it out
is her own problem.

00:16:48.747 --> 00:16:55.094
But how you take it and how you use it
is your own problem.

00:16:55.295 --> 00:16:58.594
I always bow to you people who have
got realization,

00:16:58.795 --> 00:17:02.937
because I think so many saints were
never there on this earth.

00:17:03.138 --> 00:17:07.547
But the saintliness has to be complete.

00:17:07.748 --> 00:17:12.062
Without that you cannot help even
your family,

00:17:12.263 --> 00:17:18.336
leave alone your country, and no question
of the whole world.

00:17:20.317 --> 00:17:28.158
So what is needed now is to raise your
awakening, to raise your spirituality,

00:17:28.359 --> 00:17:35.180
to go into a realm of complete support
and surrender

00:17:35.381 --> 00:17:42.250
to the movement of this spontaneous
movement of Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:48.445
May God bless you all.
