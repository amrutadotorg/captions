00:08.475 --> 00:20.834
THE GUIDANCE OF A MOTHER

00:25.506 --> 00:30.898
Seeker: Does Mother have a guru and
what point did She gain Self-realization?

00:31.099 --> 00:35.381
Sahaja Yogi: Do you have a guru and at
what stage did You receive Self-realization?

00:35.608 --> 00:38.389
Shri Mataji: I neither have a guru
nor I want you to have a guru.

00:38.590 --> 00:40.772
You’d better become your own gurus.

00:40.973 --> 00:45.545
Secondly, I’ve been born like that,
I never got any realization or anything.

00:45.746 --> 00:49.764
I just got realization, I should say
human realization when I understood

00:49.965 --> 00:51.748
what was the problem with human beings.

00:51.949 --> 00:55.264
I worked on the all permutations and
combinations of human beings,

00:55.465 --> 00:57.905
because I wanted to have an en-masse
media,

00:58.106 --> 01:00.991
by which I could give realization
to thousands of people.

01:01.192 --> 01:05.342
Because any discovery which is made
and is not brought to that level

01:05.519 --> 01:11.748
it is absolutely detrimental to the growth.

01:11.957 --> 01:17.763
For example, you see, Jesus was crucified.
Why? Because He was alone!

01:17.964 --> 01:21.625
Only for His mother, nobody knew
what He was.

01:21.826 --> 01:27.018
At that time He could not achieve this,
because you all were not there at the time.

01:27.219 --> 01:30.622
And also other people –

01:30.823 --> 01:34.461
you know how the saints have suffered,
how every prophet has suffered

01:34.662 --> 01:39.253
because they could not create a mass
understanding of it.

01:39.454 --> 01:42.992
So at a certain point it has to become
a mass thing.

01:43.193 --> 01:48.488
In the tree of life there are only three
or four flowers in the beginning,

01:48.689 --> 01:51.523
but when it grows, when the blossom
time comes,

01:51.724 --> 01:56.735
then so many flowers are there and they
become the fruits.

01:56.936 --> 02:01.495
So I, I just saw that this is the time
I have to do this job.

02:01.696 --> 02:06.845
So you would call it My “human” realization
when I understood human beings.

02:07.046 --> 02:09.882
Of course even now sometimes I get
shocked the way they behave,

02:10.083 --> 02:16.182
I mean, I just don’t understand, but
I think now I understand them.

02:17.882 --> 02:21.284
Sahaja Yogi: So those people who can’t
quite understand that answer,

02:21.485 --> 02:23.213
don’t think about it too much.
Shri Mataji: There’s another gentleman

02:23.414 --> 02:26.087
who was asking a question. Sahaja Yogi:
Mother has to be somebody special,

02:26.288 --> 02:28.442
but find out for yourself. That’s
the best way.

02:28.643 --> 02:32.105
Shri Mataji: You don’t worry about Me,
you worry about yourself. Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

02:32.306 --> 02:35.014
Shri Mataji: I must be someone, all right.
Even if I’m not, doesn’t matter.

02:35.215 --> 02:37.317
If you are going to get it, why not
have it?

02:39.231 --> 02:41.530
Sahaja Yogi: Any questions?
Shri Mataji: Yes, My child?

02:41.770 --> 02:46.053
Seeker: When I first learnt...
Excuse me?

02:46.254 --> 02:47.294
Shri Mataji: Little loud. You can... Seeker:
When I first learnt about Kundalini -

02:47.495 --> 02:58.075
a basic learning of that many years ago -
part of what I understood

02:58.276 --> 03:04.757
was that the Kundalini... you talked
about raising it spontaneously.

03:04.958 --> 03:09.710
Shri Mataji: Yes. Seeker: And what I had
understood was that you must always have

03:09.912 --> 03:14.318
a master to help you raise it,
that somewhere it isn't save,

03:14.519 --> 03:18.938
I mean, psycologically or emotionally
to raise it yourself,

03:19.139 --> 03:22.316
that you need the master to guide you.
Shri Mataji: Yes.

03:22.517 --> 03:25.496
Seeker: So I wanted to ask about the raising
of it spontaneously. Shri Mataji: Yes.

03:25.697 --> 03:28.452
She’s asking me if, that she’s read,
that you have to have a master,

03:28.653 --> 03:30.804
no doubt you have to have a master,
no doubt.

03:31.005 --> 03:33.760
Meaning the person who is
an enlightened soul.

03:33.961 --> 03:36.501
A person who is a realized soul can
only do it.

03:36.702 --> 03:39.551
I wish Jung knew how to do it; he would
have done it himself.

03:39.752 --> 03:42.619
So you have to have a master who is
called as a Sat Guru,

03:42.820 --> 03:46.384
the one who has achieved the truth,
and who is a master.

03:46.585 --> 03:51.492
Now I’m not a master, thank God,
I am not a master at all, I am a Mother.

03:51.693 --> 03:56.195
And Mother is always a master in a way.
So that’s what it is.

03:56.396 --> 03:59.715
But as far as I’m concerned,

03:59.916 --> 04:06.215
I am too soft to be a master, I think,
because I cannot be hard with people.

04:06.749 --> 04:09.265
So that’s what it is. So you have
to have a master.

04:09.466 --> 04:13.738
But to get a master rather difficult,
better get a Mother.

04:14.327 --> 04:18.271
Shri Mataji: Yes. Seeker: When some
of the speekers have talked

04:18.472 --> 04:23.687
about the primordial masters,
they’re all male.

04:23.888 --> 04:28.281
They incarnated in male bodies
and I was wondering

04:28.482 --> 04:32.780
if there was a natural lineage or why
has that been over time, in history,

04:32.981 --> 04:36.921
just say Abraham, Moses,
Lao Tse, etc.

04:37.122 --> 04:40.515
Shri Mataji: You see, first we had
to build up the fatherhood,

04:40.716 --> 04:46.264
you see, out of fear, because without fear
human beings won’t listen.

04:47.589 --> 04:51.054
Imagine at the time of Moses, the Ten
Commandments that he brought

04:51.255 --> 04:54.288
had to be chain, the people were
so horrid.

04:54.489 --> 04:57.170
He had to make them very, very strict
at that time

04:57.371 --> 04:59.991
you can see from the Books of Essenes, see,

05:00.192 --> 05:04.366
you'll get the full idea as to how
terrible the people were.

05:04.567 --> 05:12.022
Now, then we had to talk of Christ
because He had to cross the Agnya.

05:12.223 --> 05:17.317
He had to cross it because that was the
problem. That time the ego was too much.

05:17.518 --> 05:23.255
You see, imagine at the time of Romans how
they were horrid. So He had to do that job.

05:23.456 --> 05:26.544
Now, today we have reached at a point
fagged out absolutely,

05:26.745 --> 05:33.880
fed up of our egos, superegos, everything.
Now only the Mother can help you.

05:34.081 --> 05:37.911
So it has to be at different various
levels of your awareness

05:38.112 --> 05:42.950
one had to work out. Now is the time
of Mother to nourish you,

05:43.151 --> 05:45.414
is Mother to give you that love

05:45.615 --> 05:50.096
because you won’t be spoiled now any
more. That you will understand.

05:51.507 --> 05:59.140
The authority with which Moses talked,
authority with which Socrates talked,

05:59.341 --> 06:04.255
authority with which Lao Tse talked -

06:07.529 --> 06:11.618
all these great Adi Gurus,

06:13.585 --> 06:18.396
from Adi Nath to Sai Nath,

06:20.604 --> 06:27.168
they didn't say, "If you do this way will
be good, or that way would be good."

06:27.369 --> 06:32.302
No, "This is what it is, you better do it!"

06:37.977 --> 06:40.982
This is what it is.

06:44.376 --> 06:52.685
But in modern times those gurus
may not work out.

06:53.811 --> 06:57.470
That's why a Mother had to come.

07:00.724 --> 07:04.880
First to give you realization.

07:07.092 --> 07:09.822
Because these gurus did not realize
another point:

07:10.023 --> 07:17.419
that their disciples not understand
them at all.

07:18.101 --> 07:22.554
Whatever they are doing, they are
doing out of awe.

07:22.755 --> 07:27.414
But awe doesn't have understanding in it.

07:29.309 --> 07:34.372
Or even the earlier ones may have had,

07:36.082 --> 07:40.348
the generation that came afterwards
did not have.

07:40.549 --> 07:46.653
So they turned the gurus into a façade

07:46.854 --> 07:51.700
and the whole building they owned
as their own.

07:53.033 --> 07:56.357
Creating all kinds of problems,

07:56.558 --> 08:01.587
killing the universality and
the collectivity

08:02.108 --> 08:10.927
because Brahma Tattwa is the power
of the collectivity.

08:13.155 --> 08:23.125
Is in everything - in the atom,
in the molecule, in the human heart.

08:23.326 --> 08:28.728
Everywhere it is reflected, depending
on the reflector.

08:28.929 --> 08:32.200
And it controls.

08:41.407 --> 08:45.868
This understanding they had,

08:46.053 --> 08:50.118
but the human understanding perhaps
they did not have.

08:50.319 --> 08:53.790
That if you today tell them something
they might listen to us,

08:53.991 --> 08:55.766
but tomorrow they will forget.

08:55.967 --> 09:01.195
So, it was necessary that you all should
be given realization.

09:02.133 --> 09:07.490
Otherwise, also without realization,
what's the use?

09:08.990 --> 09:15.599
What's the use of talking to people about
the colors, those who don't have eyes?

09:15.800 --> 09:18.404
So realization has to be given.

09:19.448 --> 09:22.310
So the first and foremost thing we have
to know

09:22.511 --> 09:28.583
that this Sahaja Yoga has worked out
because Paramchaitanya

09:28.784 --> 09:33.435
is transmitting compassion. It never
did before.

09:33.636 --> 09:42.091
It never had that kind of an attitude which
it is there because I am a Mother.

09:42.299 --> 09:47.576
And this compassion has worked it this way
that: you all have got your realization,

09:47.777 --> 09:53.107
you have achieved a state which we can
call as a Self-realised souls.

09:53.308 --> 10:00.669
But still, because you got it so easily,
cheaply,

10:00.870 --> 10:06.073
I think still we don’t realise what we
have got.

10:06.274 --> 10:11.417
Still we do not practice meditation,

10:11.618 --> 10:18.831
introspection and dedication.
Some are very much there...

10:19.620 --> 10:24.034
Many people tell Me: “Mother, people had
to do so much: to go to Himalayas,

10:24.235 --> 10:27.988
do this, do that, and then they got
their realization.

10:28.189 --> 10:33.753
How is it these people you have blessed?”.
Even some great saints asked Me that.

10:33.954 --> 10:37.417
“What right they had to get this
realization?

10:37.618 --> 10:41.238
Why did you give them realization?
What have they achieved?”.

10:41.439 --> 10:43.770
I said, “Only their desire.

10:43.971 --> 10:48.044
Their desire was very much there that
they should get their realization

10:48.245 --> 10:51.489
and that’s how they got it“.

10:51.731 --> 11:00.013
But now to go into only desire,
is not sufficient.

11:00.214 --> 11:03.278
You have to depend on yourself,

11:03.479 --> 11:07.200
on the light of your Spirit you should see
what’s wrong with you.

11:08.127 --> 11:12.231
I am supposed to be your Guru,

11:14.299 --> 11:22.419
but I feel sometimes that the idea
of a guru

11:22.620 --> 11:27.544
is very different from Mine.

11:29.455 --> 11:35.320
Normally a guru is a very, very
strict person,

11:35.521 --> 11:39.810
and has no patience of any kind.

11:41.591 --> 11:53.185
So, there are two, three types of tests are
all the time taken off the disciple.

11:53.394 --> 11:58.982
Firstly how much they obey you.

12:02.057 --> 12:11.879
But as you all have got realization
and you are your own gurus,

12:12.080 --> 12:17.380
I don't put that condition on you.

12:19.219 --> 12:26.502
I leave it to your freedom.
I tell you earnestly,

12:26.979 --> 12:33.143
in all the ways possible, what I think
good for you.

12:34.258 --> 12:39.370
But I don't compel

12:42.664 --> 12:47.042
like these gurus used to do. I mean,
they used to beat,

12:48.524 --> 12:52.463
they used to hang them on a well,

12:53.828 --> 12:56.854
they were so very strict

12:57.055 --> 13:01.971
with their disciples and I've had
an experience of this.

13:02.922 --> 13:08.120
They never used to smile, no question
of laughing,

13:09.999 --> 13:19.940
and would never show any kind of weakness,
of kindness for the disciples.

13:20.312 --> 13:24.221
You see a Guru has to be a very
angry person,

13:24.422 --> 13:30.690
wearing only single dress either upwards or
downwards - I don’t know how they wear -

13:33.055 --> 13:37.279
with a big thick rod in the hand,

13:37.774 --> 13:43.127
never smiling – laughing no question –
smiling.

13:43.328 --> 13:51.536
And the Gurus have to be very long faced,
developing big, big beards,

13:51.922 --> 13:55.760
and no ladies allowed.

13:57.930 --> 14:04.846
In such a situation, where the women
are not to be seen at all,

14:05.047 --> 14:10.479
I mean, I shouldn’t even see My face –
it’s like that.

14:14.429 --> 14:19.604
There is a big discussion in all
the scriptures -

14:19.805 --> 14:22.612
and not scriptures, I would say
the critiques -

14:22.813 --> 14:25.940
whether a woman should be
allowed

14:26.141 --> 14:34.223
to do the spiritual practices or not,
imagine.

14:36.242 --> 14:42.643
Not only among Christians, you’ll be
surprised, even in Indian scriptures –

14:42.844 --> 14:49.192
whether is woman should be allowed
or not to do spiritual practices.

14:49.547 --> 14:58.878
Now when your Mother is a woman
and She is your Guru, what will you do?

14:59.079 --> 15:07.236
This is another confusion because
it is wrong;

15:07.437 --> 15:14.656
the whole thing is falsehood, based
on no basis at all.

15:15.468 --> 15:19.843
You may try anything to say that
women

15:20.044 --> 15:26.914
are not meant for spiritual life,

15:27.903 --> 15:32.508
try any argument, it fails.

15:34.630 --> 15:42.564
The whole thing has to be brought up
this way that everything faces reality.

15:42.765 --> 15:49.347
All these false ideas have to be
given up.

15:49.860 --> 15:53.933
Like, if you have a carpet upside-down,
the whole design is upside-down.

15:54.134 --> 15:58.121
But, if you put the carpet right,
everything falls in line.

15:58.322 --> 16:04.350
And that’s why you needed a Mother
to give you realization,

16:04.558 --> 16:08.660
and a Guru as a Mother to teach you

16:08.861 --> 16:15.688
that for ascent of God nobody can
be prohibited.

16:16.437 --> 16:19.823
Sahaja Yoga is not a military thing,

16:20.024 --> 16:27.697
it’s just plain, simple, Mother’s love.

16:28.662 --> 16:34.204
And of course every mother wants
her child to be great,

16:34.405 --> 16:39.189
to have all her powers – she wants that,
no doubt.

16:40.108 --> 16:48.546
How she does it, how she works it out
is her own problem.

16:48.747 --> 16:55.094
But how you take it and how you use it
is your own problem.

16:55.295 --> 16:58.594
I always bow to you people who have
got realization,

16:58.795 --> 17:02.937
because I think so many saints were
never there on this earth.

17:03.138 --> 17:07.547
But the saintliness has to be complete.

17:07.748 --> 17:12.062
Without that you cannot help even
your family,

17:12.263 --> 17:18.336
leave alone your country, and no question
of the whole world.

17:20.317 --> 17:28.158
So what is needed now is to raise your
awakening, to raise your spirituality,

17:28.359 --> 17:35.180
to go into a realm of complete support
and surrender

17:35.381 --> 17:42.250
to the movement of this spontaneous
movement of Sahaja Yoga.

17:45.520 --> 17:48.445
May God bless you all.
