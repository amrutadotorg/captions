00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:57.650
My joy knows no bounds

00:30:57.850 --> 00:31:07.040
when we have come to worship this holy mountain,

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:09.840
which we have named as Ganaraj.

00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:49.490
Sometimes the words are not sufficient

00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:53.300
to hold the outpour of your joy.

00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:13.120
I come to you as a symbol of your Mother,

00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:24.270
but the first son who was created. was Shri Ganesha.

00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:35.650
And then, when the Mother Earth was created

00:32:35.850 --> 00:32:38.460
as a symbol of motherhood,

00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:43.600
She created many Shri Ganeshas in this universe.

00:32:57.010 --> 00:33:13.710
In the cosmos, the star which is called as Mars,

00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:15.530
is the Ganesh, Shri Ganesha.

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:27.790
All these symbols were created

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.600
for you the Sahaja Yogis to recognize them;

00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:45.740
to recognize all these symbols

00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:51.920
is easier if you are a realized soul.

00:33:58.530 --> 00:34:07.570
But we have had so many great realized souls in the past,

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:15.240
of very high quality,

00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:22.060
and they recognized, they found out

00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:25.690
the symbols of Shri Ganesha long time back.

00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:40.300
India is the microscopic form of the whole earth, Mother Earth.

00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:52.600
So, in the triangle of Maharashtra

00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:58.490
we have got eight Ganeshas which are

00:34:58.690 --> 00:35:01.950
manifesting vibrations, and were recognized

00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:04.360
by great Saints of Maharashtra.

00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:25.050
But, as you have seen, as a grace of these great Saints,

00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:30.620
specially Maharashtra has created human beings

00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:36.680
who have shraddha as the highest expression

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:39.180
of their emotion and mind.

00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:58.480
Because of that lofty vision in the mind,

00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:04.660
whenever they see something of this sublime nature,

00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:07.260
their thoughts go to God.

00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:27.720
Thanks to the Saints of that state that people

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:32.900
have that sensitivity and that kind of a movement.

00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:51.410
Unfortunately in the West,

00:36:51.610 --> 00:36:56.800
where shraddha is something very superficial,

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:05.320
anything like this takes them to something very low,

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:11.460
something very dirty, filthy, unholy.

00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:45.570
Instead of surrendering to the Sublime,

00:37:45.770 --> 00:37:48.930
and enjoying the greatness of the Sublime,

00:37:49.130 --> 00:37:53.810
they take to something very carnal,

00:37:54.010 --> 00:37:56.640
which belongs to the flesh.

00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:17.150
But still the people who are

00:38:17.350 --> 00:38:23.390
living in simple ways in the villages, in the nature,

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:30.230
must have realized the importance of this holy mountain.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.500
Thousands and thousands, millions of years back,

00:38:55.320 --> 00:39:01.240
the Mother Earth started producing Her Ganesha.

00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:16.660
It was first a huge ocean where Himalaya stands.

00:39:24.970 --> 00:39:31.490
Himalaya gradually started coming out of that ocean,

00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:39.380
in a flat way, like a Shiva-Linga,

00:39:48.090 --> 00:39:52.150
which is the expression as the manifestation of the animals,

00:39:52.350 --> 00:39:55.350
they have the brains which are flat

00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:32.900
in this way.

00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:45.310
But when the Himalayas started coming out of that sea,

00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:48.940
the Mother Earth was pushed on sides,

00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:00.730
and the Mother Earth started

00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:03.870
giving folds to Her sari, you can say.

00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:27.960
Now, when that movement started,

00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:34.580
the sari gave waves of vibrations in such a way

00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:38.260
that at certain points it

00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:44.180
rose up to a point becoming like Shri Ganesha.

00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:15.740
And it was, to begin with, of flat,

00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:19.280
again the same types of the ...

00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:34.910
But then, still more folds started coming up, much later,

00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:40.110
when human brain started developing its ego.

00:42:54.650 --> 00:42:58.430
So the whole of that land was pushed up

00:42:58.630 --> 00:43:02.070
and another land joined it in such a manner

00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:04.770
that it formed a apex,

00:43:11.610 --> 00:43:13.120
pushed it.

00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:21.910
The super-ego was pushed in and was brought to the climax.

00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:36.630
That synchronizes with the human brain,

00:43:36.830 --> 00:43:38.300
because the whole universe

00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:42.100
is represented in our body as well.

00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:02.620
Now, the central axis of the Mother Earth

00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:05.900
acted as the spinal cord.

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:19.950
By this happening in the Himalayas,

00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:26.820
again there was a big push onto all the mountains

00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:28.020
which were to be created as Shri Ganesh

00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:35.210
and they got into their final forms,

00:44:50.850 --> 00:44:52.890
and the apex was created.

00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:05.350
So the Mother Earth as Gauri created all these Ganeshas.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.300
At the other end of these ranges

00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:23.530
must be the highest mountain because it is pushed the most.

00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:31.570
Mont Blanc should be higher than this one.

00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:40.740
You see, when they pushed it,

00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:45.850
Himalaya was brought up to a point, up to a point it went,

00:45:46.050 --> 00:45:51.720
and then the waves created Ganesha of a certain height,

00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:53.500
not too much height.

00:45:53.710 --> 00:45:56.070
So it was pushed on the right hand side more:

00:45:56.270 --> 00:45:59.910
the ego went, you see, expression in Mont Blanc,

00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:01.800
you see for example.

00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:53.290
And on the other side, it was created another Ganesha

00:46:53.490 --> 00:46:56.820
at the other end near Darjeeling.

00:46:57.020 --> 00:46:59.960
Shri Mataji, is the Mont Blanc expression of Shri Ganesha also?

00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:03.230
No, no, it is the expression of ego.

00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:06.600
Ego, yes, it's in France.

00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:29.600
So Shri Ganesha was expressed even in Darjeeling,

00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:33.500
and you get the same kind of redness on that.

00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:46.700
I have seen another Shri Ganesh created in Delphi

00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:51.410
where they say is the Nabhi of the Mother Earth.

00:48:10.970 --> 00:48:17.490
Also when Shri Shiva is created, Linga is created,

00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:21.390
along with Him always there is a Shri Ganesha created,

00:48:21.590 --> 00:48:24.680
as in [AMBARNATH], where a drop of water

00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:29.540
falls on a particular area and creates the Linga.

00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:32.950
Plus that, another drop falls on another side

00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:36.560
and creates Shri Ganesh, exactly like the face.

00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:27.890
Now the ocean is the Father,

00:49:28.090 --> 00:49:32.450
and the Mother Earth is your Mother,

00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:39.850
but when the Mother Earth becomes a mountain,

00:49:40.050 --> 00:49:43.410
She is called as the Father.

00:49:43.610 --> 00:49:48.580
The reason is: She, at that height, can catch the Father

00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:52.560
on top of Her head, as snow or as rain.

00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:17.960
That is how a Mother becomes the Father,

00:50:20.930 --> 00:50:23.660
and so She can perform

00:50:23.870 --> 00:50:26.870
the complete function of a Father and a Mother.

00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:38.250
In that state only Gauri, the Daughter of the Mountains,

00:50:38.450 --> 00:50:41.680
conceived Shri Ganesha

00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:45.630
without the help of the Father, immaculate.

00:50:57.720 --> 00:51:02.400
The purity of the snow is hundred percent,

00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:04.650
and that covers the Mother Earth,

00:51:04.850 --> 00:51:08.350
gives the formation of Innocence.

00:51:19.780 --> 00:51:23.880
All the filth and dirt that goes into the ocean

00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:28.390
is clarified by the sun, which is also Shri Ganesha,

00:51:28.590 --> 00:51:35.400
and is brought on top of the hills and mountains to cover it.

00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:38.730
Well, this is Divine Ecology.

00:52:15.610 --> 00:52:24.270
But to Ganesh it is a big problem to exist in a country

00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:26.820
which doesn't worship it.

00:52:34.930 --> 00:52:37.440
It has no sense of respect.

00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:50.150
It is always aspired that they should climb over

00:52:58.710 --> 00:53:02.250
with a very egotistical ambitions,

00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:08.790
of a low level and outward.

00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:19.180
When you see the mountains like this,

00:53:19.380 --> 00:53:27.960
the idea that should come into a good human being would be,

00:53:29.070 --> 00:53:33.800
O God, I can see You in this sublime form,

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.980
and how will I conquer my ignorance?

00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:41.780
How will I climb over my mountain

00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:45.810
of arrogance to look at You?

00:54:19.180 --> 00:54:23.320
To a egotistical mind,

00:54:23.550 --> 00:54:30.810
the mountain is for the joy of the eyes,

00:54:31.010 --> 00:54:33.950
and the joy which is really not the joy,

00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:37.740
but is a kind of a pleasure for them to see.

00:54:53.010 --> 00:54:55.360
Their ego gets challenged

00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:57.870
and they want to climb on the mountain that,

00:54:58.070 --> 00:54:59.560
We are higher than You!

00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:11.480
We had Himalayas for thousands

00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:13.590
and thousands of years in India;

00:55:13.790 --> 00:55:16.090
nobody ever thought of climbing it.

00:55:22.780 --> 00:55:26.410
When the English came, they started it doing it first time.

00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:36.250
Then the French, Portuguese, Spanish,

00:55:36.460 --> 00:55:38.270
all of them all did this

00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:40.640
and the Indians were looking at them bewildered,

00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:42.530
What are they doing?

00:55:50.990 --> 00:55:52.910
Why do they want to climb the mountains?

00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:58.830
Is better to see them from distance

00:55:59.030 --> 00:56:03.670
and adore them, than to climb over them to die.

00:56:12.590 --> 00:56:15.960
But this egotistical mind can go further,

00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:18.150
as in Switzerland it has gone,

00:56:18.350 --> 00:56:21.510
that they try to ski over these mountains,

00:56:21.710 --> 00:56:24.030
take the slopes to go down.

00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:26.720
They go down in any case,

00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:43.320
and they break their legs.

00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:47.130
I told one Sahaja Yogi who wanted to come here for skiing,

00:56:47.330 --> 00:56:50.220
I said, Don't go there, it's not allowed by Sahaja Yoga,

00:56:50.420 --> 00:56:52.550
and he came back with broken legs.

00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:12.530
So every way the games are also such

00:57:12.730 --> 00:57:16.480
that it's just a satisfaction of the ego.

00:57:25.370 --> 00:57:28.630
I can understand small children going over a slide,

00:57:28.830 --> 00:57:33.750
but big old men moving like this for hours together,

00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:35.930
have they no other work to do?

00:57:46.780 --> 00:57:49.210
That shows they have no maturity of any kind,

00:57:49.410 --> 00:57:53.970
they are still stupid children playing with the snow.

00:57:54.170 --> 00:57:56.720
There are the bhoots of all the skiers around,

00:57:56.920 --> 00:57:58.620
I think Shri Mataji is talking to all of us.

00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:10.610
By all these doings, what happens

00:58:10.810 --> 00:58:15.250
that the holy places become like cemeteries.

00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:33.920
Imagine, instead of putting flowers on Shri Ganesha

00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:36.440
you are putting dead bodies on His Body.

00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:50.910
And, while skiing, putting those hard nails

00:58:51.110 --> 00:58:53.820
into the Body of Shri Ganesh.

00:58:57.410 --> 00:58:58.870
It's true.

00:59:08.580 --> 00:59:11.020
There is no sense of respect.

00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:21.340
Perhaps we don't respect ourselves, we are not mature enough.

00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:28.680
The first thing that should happen,

00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:32.060
that one folds his hands to Shri Ganesh

00:59:32.260 --> 00:59:34.100
and just sees those things.

00:59:34.300 --> 00:59:37.310
Just this should happen to all the Sahaja Yogis.

00:59:59.980 --> 01:00:02.520
So the innocence has to be developed to have that respect;

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:05.720
if you are not innocent, you cannot have respect.

01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:13.470
And in the Innocence you don't think

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:15.400
you are the wisest of all

01:00:15.610 --> 01:00:18.600
and make everybody look like a fool,

01:00:24.050 --> 01:00:27.320
nor do you laugh at others and make fun of them,

01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:33.040
nor do you play games and put people down.

01:00:45.090 --> 01:00:50.410
But what I have seen, even coming to Sahaja Yoga,

01:00:50.610 --> 01:00:52.120
this is the worst part of it,

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:53.740
I have seen people who play games

01:00:53.940 --> 01:00:55.390
after coming to Sahaja Yoga.

01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:11.510
They gossip and say all kinds of wrong things

01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:13.710
which I've never said before.

01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:26.950
There was so many kinds of things I hear

01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:32.060
that I'm amazed how Sahaja Yogis are such creators of gossips.

01:01:43.010 --> 01:01:46.540
Is this the way Ganesha would behave towards the Mother?

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:55.100
That thinking yourself to be great people you say,

01:01:55.310 --> 01:01:58.760
Mother said so, and this happened, and that happened.

01:02:07.650 --> 01:02:10.300
Ego is anti-innocence,

01:02:13.410 --> 01:02:17.450
and that's why this kind of a nonsensical gossip people do,

01:02:17.650 --> 01:02:19.690
which I can't understand, it is so filthy,

01:02:19.890 --> 01:02:21.240
I just can't understand.

01:02:29.850 --> 01:02:34.110
Like there was one lady whom nobody would marry,

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:36.250
and there was only one fellow

01:02:36.450 --> 01:02:38.810
who accepted to marry that woman,

01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:46.940
and that's how the marriage took place.

01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:52.870
Now this lady, or perhaps somebody who is like her,

01:02:53.070 --> 01:02:55.940
has spread stories that she was the most beautiful woman,

01:02:56.140 --> 01:02:59.060
everybody wanted to marry her, everybody raised their hands.

01:02:59.260 --> 01:03:01.250
I never asked people to raise their hands.

01:03:01.450 --> 01:03:05.280
It's not like that at all. When I heard it, I was shocked:

01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:07.860
this woman, nobody wanted to marry her.

01:03:24.530 --> 01:03:25.910
There are all kinds of things

01:03:26.110 --> 01:03:28.970
that you have got from your past,

01:03:35.390 --> 01:03:37.150
and you must try to get out of it,

01:03:37.350 --> 01:03:39.350
otherwise you cannot rise high.

01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:55.630
A person who is not innocent cannot worship Shri Ganesh.

01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:03.970
In His right hand He has got a Parashu, you must know that,

01:04:04.170 --> 01:04:08.710
a terrible instrument, you see, with one stroke

01:04:08.910 --> 01:04:11.510
He takes out your head, like guillotine it is.

01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:27.840
Those who are not innocent, play games, try tricks,

01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:31.790
gossip, indulge in filth, He cuts them out.

01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:48.920
Innocence is a very sharp thing.

01:04:52.940 --> 01:04:54.860
It does not have any compromise,

01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:57.520
which you can see in the life of Christ.

01:05:02.190 --> 01:05:04.190
With His trunk He throws people

01:05:04.350 --> 01:05:06.750
left and right and throws them out.

01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:19.850
He sees for a while, and if people remain still half-baked,

01:05:20.050 --> 01:05:22.080
they are thrown out of Sahaja Yoga.

01:05:40.130 --> 01:05:43.290
No one should think that you have got Realization,

01:05:43.490 --> 01:05:47.330
you can be in the Sahaja Yoga

01:05:47.530 --> 01:05:50.450
if you do not take to innocence.

01:06:02.070 --> 01:06:04.540
Innocence gives you complete sincerity,

01:06:08.110 --> 01:06:10.840
and Ganesha is the judge,

01:06:14.330 --> 01:06:17.450
and He is the one who throws you out

01:06:17.650 --> 01:06:22.210
of the periphery like a tangent you get out of Sahaja Yoga.

01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:32.370
And when you get out of Sahaja Yoga,

01:06:32.570 --> 01:06:35.340
you start going down and down and down,

01:06:35.540 --> 01:06:38.170
and then you may develop horrible diseases

01:06:38.370 --> 01:06:39.370
of the Mooladhara chakra.

01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:55.040
Those who are hit by Him are the worst;

01:06:55.230 --> 01:06:57.540
if you have come near Him, be careful.

01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:12.400
Face yourself, see yourself, note yourself.

01:07:19.100 --> 01:07:21.570
Another thing they told Me that some people

01:07:21.770 --> 01:07:24.130
think that they are great Sahaja Yogis

01:07:24.330 --> 01:07:27.660
who contribute nothing to Sahaja Yoga but headaches.

01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:43.340
If some sane Sahaja Yogi starts telling

01:07:43.540 --> 01:07:48.440
the other Sahaja Yogi about something sensible,

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:50.770
this fellow puts up his right Vishuddhi,

01:07:50.970 --> 01:07:53.420
pressing it hard on him to show that,

01:07:53.620 --> 01:07:56.540
You are talking because your right Vishuddhi is catching,

01:07:56.740 --> 01:07:57.740
very cunning.

01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:26.820
You are not to play games, because you are harming yourself,

01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:28.310
I'm telling you now.

01:08:35.380 --> 01:08:38.880
Those who think they can play with the loopholes

01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:42.470
must know that there's a loop round their neck.

01:09:10.530 --> 01:09:15.960
Like the fallen angels you will go to the greater heights,

01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:20.200
or depths, of mire.

01:09:33.790 --> 01:09:36.570
So try to be honest to yourself.

01:09:48.050 --> 01:09:52.680
Any nation has any problem,

01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:57.650
any sins they have been committing or have committed before,

01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:09.310
should not be any more [a tag] with you.

01:10:15.370 --> 01:10:20.760
If a country has been cunning, then you should be innocent.

01:10:26.940 --> 01:10:32.880
If you are coming from a foxy clan, you have to be innocent.

01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:41.460
Like you are coming from a thuggery clan,

01:10:41.660 --> 01:10:45.240
then you have to be extremely astute.

01:10:54.850 --> 01:10:57.750
If you are coming from the romantic clan,

01:10:57.950 --> 01:10:59.930
you have to be extremely pure.

01:11:06.490 --> 01:11:08.360
You have to be juxtaposition

01:11:08.570 --> 01:11:11.450
of whatever sins we are suffering from.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.520
If you are the light in the darkness,

01:11:21.730 --> 01:11:24.480
you have to be brilliant and not dark,

01:11:28.660 --> 01:11:33.910
and you have to give light in the darkness, to the dark,

01:11:34.110 --> 01:11:36.800
not to take dark upon yourself.

01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:47.720
So, if you really feel that the past

01:11:47.930 --> 01:11:50.070
of your country has been such and such,

01:11:50.270 --> 01:11:52.860
you better study it and know for yourself

01:11:53.070 --> 01:11:55.640
that you have to be just different.

01:12:10.110 --> 01:12:13.710
Some are comfort-loving, they should get out of that.

01:12:18.490 --> 01:12:21.100
Some are pleasure-loving, they should get out of that.

01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:29.480
Some are tempted with women and men

01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:30.840
and drinking and all that,

01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:33.750
you should completely give up and come out of it.

01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:46.650
There are deeper sins we have of cunningness,

01:12:46.850 --> 01:12:49.680
of aggressiveness, of slyness,

01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:54.800
all these thing are to be studied and understood

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.450
that what do we have to do for our country

01:12:57.650 --> 01:13:00.290
is to get out of it completely first of all,

01:13:00.490 --> 01:13:02.540
like the lotus out of the mire.

01:13:21.470 --> 01:13:23.880
If your country is racist,

01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:26.720
then you have to become absolutely

01:13:26.930 --> 01:13:29.450
a person completely integrated.

01:13:39.050 --> 01:13:42.240
Like that you have to be on the [JUXTAPOSITION]

01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:45.600
to rise higher than the rest of them

01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:48.920
to give them a proper lead.

01:13:58.690 --> 01:14:03.790
I can tell you that Shiva tolerates lot of nonsense,

01:14:03.990 --> 01:14:08.870
because he is fond of forgiving,

01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:21.730
and Vishnu principle tries to play with them

01:14:21.930 --> 01:14:24.600
and punish them or kill them.

01:14:32.650 --> 01:14:37.900
But Ganesha Tattwa has no compromise of any kind,

01:14:43.620 --> 01:14:46.450
and when this become Ekadesha Rudra,

01:14:46.650 --> 01:14:49.440
and when Christ is going to come in that form,

01:14:49.660 --> 01:14:52.660
then there will be no compromise, no Mataji,

01:14:52.870 --> 01:14:55.440
no crying, no argument, nothing;

01:15:13.830 --> 01:15:17.610
Shri Ganesha Himself will throw people into hell.

01:15:22.590 --> 01:15:24.040
So be careful on that!

01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:26.390
Today, in the Presence of Shri Ganesha,

01:15:26.590 --> 01:15:28.440
you have to take an oath that,

01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:31.250
Whatever is the past of my country,

01:15:31.450 --> 01:15:34.690
I will get opposite to that.

01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:54.080
Like I would say Indians are not very good with the money;

01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:56.590
money matters they can be very horrid,

01:15:56.790 --> 01:16:01.450
and sometimes they create a problem with money matters.

01:16:01.670 --> 01:16:03.420
So, one has to know that we have to be

01:16:03.620 --> 01:16:06.010
absolutely astute as far as money is concerned.

01:16:16.740 --> 01:16:22.870
It is not sufficient only to be something innocent,

01:16:23.070 --> 01:16:25.960
but it is more that it should be proved,

01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:28.980
that people should know that you are innocent!

01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:42.370
Like I asked My son-in law, he is a very honest man,

01:16:42.570 --> 01:16:47.990
whether this would be honesty, so he answered,

01:16:48.190 --> 01:16:52.260
This may be honesty for outside purpose,

01:16:52.460 --> 01:16:55.640
but it is not in the essence of honesty.

01:17:09.220 --> 01:17:14.040
So, that is how you have to be honest, in the essence of it,

01:17:17.340 --> 01:17:20.710
and the essence of honesty is innocence.

01:17:23.790 --> 01:17:25.900
Essence of sincerity is innocence.

01:17:28.340 --> 01:17:31.660
Essence of beauty, glory, is innocence,

01:17:35.780 --> 01:17:41.150
and innocence is the one that gives you complete detachment.

01:17:45.410 --> 01:17:48.620
So, to such a symbol of innocence, when we bow,

01:17:48.820 --> 01:17:51.600
we must know what we have done about ourselves.

01:17:58.980 --> 01:18:03.170
Whatever has been your past, get out of it.

01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:12.070
Be just the opposite of what has been so bad before.

01:18:17.580 --> 01:18:22.170
Strongly against all that you were before, in the darkness.

01:18:27.350 --> 01:18:29.650
That is the sign of your character,

01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:35.020
and of your strength,

01:18:36.350 --> 01:18:39.680
and will show to the world that your Spirit,

01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:41.120
which is enlightened within you,

01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:47.400
has given you that strength and that new dimension.

01:18:56.260 --> 01:18:58.880
So the second oath we have to take

01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:01.320
before Shri Ganesha is that,

01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:03.780
I will be honest to myself.

01:19:13.030 --> 01:19:16.240
I will not deceive myself for anybody's sake.

01:19:21.460 --> 01:19:25.340
Now the third great thing about Shri Ganesha is

01:19:25.540 --> 01:19:29.430
that for Him no Gods exist except His Mother.

01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:41.560
And you know all the stories about Shri Ganesha,

01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:44.320
how He adored His Mother,

01:19:50.570 --> 01:19:53.590
because He knows His Mother is the Power;

01:19:58.390 --> 01:20:01.700
and that He is the source of your wisdom,

01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:15.630
He's the embodiment of wisdom,

01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:21.560
and the greatest wisdom He has:

01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:25.090
that it is better to worship the Mother than anybody else,

01:20:25.290 --> 01:20:26.780
because She is the Power.

01:20:36.420 --> 01:20:39.360
According to Him, even the Father, if you have to meet,

01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:41.080
you have to go through the Mother,

01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:43.960
and secondly Father is just the Witness.

01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:58.480
All His security, all His powers, all His beauty,

01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:00.890
innocence, comes from His Mother.

01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:11.670
So with the third oath you have to take that,

01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:15.030
For us, our Mother is so powerful,

01:21:15.230 --> 01:21:17.310
why should we be afraid of anything?

01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:32.180
If She is going to give us the wisdom,

01:21:32.380 --> 01:21:35.730
why should we try to seek it anywhere else?

01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:46.230
I appear very innocent sometimes,

01:21:50.450 --> 01:21:54.280
but My innocence is complete intelligence, I think,

01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:18.090
and that is the reason, you see, people take time to accept.

01:22:23.980 --> 01:22:27.090
But people like Shri Ganesh

01:22:27.290 --> 01:22:30.280
who are the wisest of all, know the trick.

01:22:40.430 --> 01:22:43.650
The another oath we have to take today

01:22:43.850 --> 01:22:47.950
that, we'll respect every Sahaja Yogi from our heart,

01:22:48.150 --> 01:22:52.550
because they are made in the form of Shri Ganesha.

01:23:05.810 --> 01:23:07.760
We'll not make fun of them,

01:23:09.830 --> 01:23:11.180
we'll not laugh at them,

01:23:13.090 --> 01:23:16.230
as long as they are in Sahaja Yoga we have to respect.

01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:21.460
But they can be thrown away,

01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:25.800
they can get out of it.

01:23:27.990 --> 01:23:30.200
But unless and until this happens,

01:23:32.870 --> 01:23:37.950
do not put your ego on other people.

01:23:42.070 --> 01:23:44.500
Don't think that you understand everything.

01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:51.220
Don't think that you know everything.

01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:55.720
Respect each and every person,

01:23:58.610 --> 01:24:01.990
not for what he has read or what he has learnt,

01:24:02.190 --> 01:24:05.000
but because he is a great soul.

01:24:15.390 --> 01:24:18.320
I feel the whole West suffers from one,

01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:20.600
one simple disease, that is, they do not know

01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:22.790
how to respect anyone.

01:24:29.950 --> 01:24:31.940
Whatever doesn't suit their mind,

01:24:32.140 --> 01:24:34.830
they will never accept nor will respect.

01:24:41.470 --> 01:24:43.480
With their ego they want to judge everyone

01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:45.250
and condemn everyone.

01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:50.620
So, get out of it,

01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:55.920
and tell yourself, I don't know anything.

01:25:01.410 --> 01:25:03.490
I was a stupid fool with my ego.

01:25:07.020 --> 01:25:11.580
Humble down yourself in your heart, open your heart,

01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:18.230
and love each other.

01:25:20.060 --> 01:25:24.640
Respect and love is the two things

01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:27.300
you have to promise to Shri Ganesha.

01:25:31.750 --> 01:25:35.630
If you cannot do that, your ascent is going to be very difficult.

01:25:40.620 --> 01:25:41.900
May God bless you!
