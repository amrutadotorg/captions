00:00.000 --> 00:06.234
Subtlety. Dollis Hill, London (UK), 8 June 1980.

00:07.000 --> 00:16.511
It is only possible for people who are of a subtler nature

00:16.711 --> 00:25.378
to understand the value of Sahaj Yoga,

00:25.578 --> 00:30.519
to hold to the values of Sahaj Yog,

00:30.719 --> 00:37.699
and to retain it in this fragmented world.

00:37.899 --> 00:42.729
The world is fragmented

00:42.929 --> 00:49.875
and everybody is acting towards one’s own destruction.

00:52.698 --> 01:00.798
All the values which people follow are gross values.

01:00.998 --> 01:06.103
Most of the values are absolutely gross.

01:06.303 --> 01:11.942
So for Sahaj Yoga we have to have people

01:12.142 --> 01:20.165
who are trying to justify their subtleties.

01:22.153 --> 01:28.243
Such subtler people

01:28.443 --> 01:34.157
have always been

01:34.357 --> 01:38.180
a little different from the mundane crowd;

01:38.380 --> 01:44.551
and these people

01:44.752 --> 01:53.387
always express themselves in such a manner

01:53.588 --> 01:59.919
that their existence itself suggests

02:00.119 --> 02:10.953
that they are trying to cement the whole world.

02:11.153 --> 02:16.810
Sort of you can feel that.

02:18.125 --> 02:25.070
[Marathi]

02:29.558 --> 02:33.616
Those who can feel

02:33.816 --> 02:39.493
that there is an element within us

02:39.693 --> 02:45.556
which makes us laugh at the stupidity of others,

02:45.756 --> 02:48.940
who may appear to themselves

02:49.140 --> 02:51.604
to be very seriously doing certain things.

02:51.804 --> 02:55.319
But to us it seems as if it’s rather stupid to

02:55.520 --> 02:59.337
waste their lives.

02:59.538 --> 03:04.893
This is a calibre of different people.

03:05.093 --> 03:07.796
First these people, with that calibre

03:07.997 --> 03:10.038
and that dynamism within them,

03:10.239 --> 03:16.469
will be settled in Sahaja Yoga, not the ordinary gross type.

03:16.669 --> 03:22.641
But because our doors are open to everyone,

03:22.841 --> 03:30.231
because there is no charge or anything, for anything,

03:30.431 --> 03:34.447
all sorts of people come in.

03:35.704 --> 03:39.407
And when they come in they don’t know what they want.

03:39.607 --> 03:45.047
Out of them some could be the grossest of all.

03:45.247 --> 03:49.320
Some might be just walking in to take out some things,

03:49.520 --> 03:53.770
just to steal something; possibly.

03:54.364 --> 03:58.893
I have seen all kinds of people coming to Sahaj Yog.

03:59.093 --> 04:02.354
Such people when they find that there’s something available,

04:02.554 --> 04:06.515
they come in and go away.

04:06.715 --> 04:15.866
Another kind, maybe, which is coming here,

04:16.066 --> 04:23.258
is the one which is extremely gross,

04:23.458 --> 04:31.389
but they can think that he can make some liaison work here;

04:31.589 --> 04:36.474
[that] by having connections with different people

04:36.674 --> 04:41.356
he can exploit it and make some money out of it.

04:41.556 --> 04:45.028
So money mindedness is a very gross thing,

04:45.228 --> 04:48.833
is a very gross thing.

04:49.033 --> 04:51.634
If people are money minded

04:51.853 --> 04:57.187
then Sahaja Yoga doesn’t work out well with them.

04:57.984 --> 05:00.647
If you always think about money, of your insurance,

05:00.848 --> 05:04.174
about how the carpet is spoiled, this has happened, that happened:

05:04.374 --> 05:08.950
such people are very difficult.

05:09.150 --> 05:12.294
But lower than these are the people who come here

05:12.494 --> 05:17.312
to have some sort of an exploitation out of Sahaj Yog.

05:17.512 --> 05:21.398
Such gross people also come in,

05:21.598 --> 05:26.656
and when they find that they cannot work out their plans,

05:26.856 --> 05:30.684
they get out of it.

05:31.809 --> 05:36.632
Now the third type of people who come here,

05:36.832 --> 05:42.619
they come for some material gain from Sahaj Yog,

05:42.819 --> 05:46.017
maybe physical gain also: like somebody is sick,

05:46.217 --> 05:49.376
so they come for their sickness.

05:49.576 --> 05:52.014
It’s a very gross way of looking at things:

05:52.215 --> 05:57.835
is to come to Sahaj Yog for getting cured.

05:59.327 --> 06:03.921
So when they get cured they disappear.

06:07.940 --> 06:12.354
Quite stupid isn’t it!

06:14.136 --> 06:18.366
Then some people come with the idea that,

06:18.566 --> 06:22.437
“Maybe, with Mother’s blessings, our financial problems will be solved.”

06:22.637 --> 06:25.606
Only with that idea!

06:25.806 --> 06:29.130
Then they also get their financial problems solved,

06:29.330 --> 06:32.611
and they get out.

06:37.062 --> 06:40.268
But some of them do not,

06:40.468 --> 06:47.453
some of them cannot manage what they want to have,

06:47.653 --> 06:51.926
then they get upset.

06:54.994 --> 07:01.595
Now the best calibre, of the subtlest form,

07:01.795 --> 07:10.841
is that which is just seeking Sahaj Yog,

07:11.041 --> 07:18.976
which is just seeking union with God, nothing else;

07:19.176 --> 07:23.027
that’s the best calibre.

07:29.830 --> 07:35.588
That calibre works hard.

07:36.674 --> 07:41.923
It has very concentrated effort.

07:42.123 --> 07:47.233
It understands Sahaj Yog very quick.

07:51.327 --> 07:55.994
[The] only thing is that,

07:56.194 --> 08:03.166
because of Western habit of thinking,

08:03.366 --> 08:11.303
some of the people, though they have a calibre,

08:11.503 --> 08:16.506
circulate around themselves;

08:16.706 --> 08:21.774
they go on thinking about it, discussing about it,

08:21.974 --> 08:24.821
arguing about it,

08:25.021 --> 08:29.601
and then they become stationed at a point.

08:29.801 --> 08:35.523
(laughing) Otherwise it goes little round and round itself.

08:35.723 --> 08:40.726
They have a calibre, they have a height, they definitely have.

08:40.927 --> 08:46.458
They have that weight in them, they can feel their element,

08:46.657 --> 08:48.973
but still they go on, as a habit,

08:49.174 --> 08:54.996
because they are used to it; they go on encircling round and round and round.

08:55.196 --> 09:00.063
They have to steady themselves.

09:03.297 --> 09:07.968
But

09:08.168 --> 09:16.482
the calibre of a person

09:16.682 --> 09:25.908
who just wants to be, to become,

09:26.108 --> 09:31.009
can never be deterred by anything,

09:31.209 --> 09:35.017
because he is subtle, in a way;

09:35.217 --> 09:40.174
in his lifetime he feels the subtleties of the unconscious.

09:40.374 --> 09:46.933
He has felt his archetype images of these Deities.

09:47.133 --> 09:50.433
He has known them.

09:50.633 --> 09:55.821
He had these eruptions within him.

09:56.290 --> 10:03.957
He identifies and he recognises

10:04.157 --> 10:08.604
the subtleties that he has felt

10:08.804 --> 10:12.151
and he tallies them with Sahaj Yog,

10:12.351 --> 10:17.775
and Sahaja Yoga gets him like that.

10:24.744 --> 10:32.728
Now these subtleties which I am describing to you,

10:32.928 --> 10:40.468
come to you not through your mental effort of this lifetime,

10:40.668 --> 10:46.767
but comes to you from the experiences of many lives

10:46.967 --> 10:52.056
you have gone through

10:52.256 --> 10:58.271
and as soon as you come near Sahaja Yoga,

10:58.471 --> 11:02.083
you start sucking.

11:02.283 --> 11:06.322
That is the best calibre.

11:06.775 --> 11:10.833
But, because the door is open ajar,

11:11.033 --> 11:13.708
the grossest of gross also can come in.

11:13.908 --> 11:18.931
But sometimes they come this way and go back the same way.

11:19.131 --> 11:23.251
Some of them, they come half way and rush back.

11:23.451 --> 11:28.470
Some of them come inside and get out from the other side.

11:29.274 --> 11:36.649
But those who stay are the people who are subtler by nature.

11:40.271 --> 11:44.454
It is a very subtle happening.

11:44.654 --> 11:49.412
If you have lost your subtleties:

11:49.612 --> 11:51.612
say, some people as I said,

11:51.813 --> 11:55.325
even doing hard work with your fingers, you become insensitive.

11:55.526 --> 11:59.786
Even physical disrespect to your fingers,

11:59.986 --> 12:06.798
you become a little bit insensitive,

12:08.459 --> 12:13.212
[so that] even when you get your Realisation,

12:13.412 --> 12:17.571
you may not feel the vibrations that good.

12:17.771 --> 12:19.557
But that is not so important.

12:19.758 --> 12:25.393
Of course, vibrations you must feel for Realisation.

12:26.721 --> 12:30.632
But maybe due to some external reasons also,

12:30.832 --> 12:37.280
or maybe due to some physical problem,

12:37.480 --> 12:43.627
you may get

12:43.827 --> 12:49.307
a situation where you may not feel the vibrations so much.

12:49.507 --> 12:51.853
But doubts would not rise in your minds

12:52.053 --> 12:55.275
because there are no vibrations.

12:55.475 --> 12:59.033
You would just think that, “Yes the vibrations are not there,

12:59.233 --> 13:02.353
I must get my Vishuddhi Chakra all right.

13:02.553 --> 13:06.202
But it is there.”

13:09.530 --> 13:15.322
And even if the doubts come in,

13:15.522 --> 13:21.326
a subtle person will fight it,

13:21.526 --> 13:27.589
will argue it out, but a gross person won’t.

13:32.268 --> 13:39.491
The subtle person is a brave man

13:39.691 --> 13:44.671
and his bravery comes from

13:44.871 --> 13:51.643
his built in capacity of those subtleties.

13:55.510 --> 13:58.005
He does not succumb to doubts.

13:58.205 --> 14:04.759
He just sees it [and] he fights it. He does not succumb to it.

14:07.618 --> 14:09.778
But Sahaja Yoga is such a wonderful thing

14:09.979 --> 14:14.498
[that] even those people who sometimes looked very gross,

14:14.698 --> 14:18.812
suddenly came out

14:19.012 --> 14:23.375
with such a beautiful manifestation of subtleties

14:23.575 --> 14:27.437
that it is surprising.

14:27.637 --> 14:31.754
But that is exceptional.

14:35.364 --> 14:47.060
The mind, and the human brain,

14:47.260 --> 14:52.483
is subtle on certain points and gross on some points;

14:52.683 --> 14:57.753
it’s most surprising. Maybe [due to the] background, maybe the…

14:57.954 --> 15:02.132
Can you take her at the back. Because
you know it’s disturbing. Nah?

15:02.333 --> 15:07.410
Just now take her at the back all right? Good!

15:09.907 --> 15:13.933
Just give her a seat to sit down all right? Sorry!

15:14.133 --> 15:17.457
Then I am going to take you in my lap, huh?

15:17.657 --> 15:22.592
She is very unhappy to leave the place!

15:25.701 --> 15:31.102
It’s a very subtle subject, you see. Please pay attention.

15:33.758 --> 15:38.262
If a genius is created.

15:38.463 --> 15:40.463
Or we can say a...

15:40.664 --> 15:43.636
They call it a prodigy, but I would call it a genius.

15:43.836 --> 15:48.027
There’s a difference between a prodigy and a genius:

15:48.227 --> 15:59.654
prodigy is a person who, for a short time of their lifespan,

15:59.854 --> 16:02.771
suddenly becomes very talented,

16:02.971 --> 16:06.076
and after some time the talent goes away.

16:06.276 --> 16:09.338
And a prodigious person may be mentally

16:09.539 --> 16:17.095
absolutely very, very low; very low.

16:17.295 --> 16:28.237
So it is done by some sort of a spirit possession.

16:28.437 --> 16:33.197
But a person who is a genius

16:33.397 --> 16:37.720
is a person who has those sensitivities.

16:37.920 --> 16:41.009
The mind which is covered with thoughts,

16:41.209 --> 16:44.165
which is thickened,

16:44.365 --> 16:46.571
which is gross,

16:46.771 --> 16:48.907
can be thinned out at certain points

16:49.107 --> 16:54.074
and could be very sensitive to certain points.

16:54.894 --> 17:02.124
For example, some people could be very sensitive to music,

17:02.324 --> 17:10.129
some could be to art, some could be to human beings,

17:10.329 --> 17:14.442
some could be to other things

17:14.642 --> 17:25.384
which might make them rare people.

17:26.454 --> 17:33.422
But these subtler things,

17:33.622 --> 17:37.891
which create your personality,

17:38.091 --> 17:41.848
always indicate, in your being,

17:42.048 --> 17:46.762
that there is something of the beyond,

17:46.962 --> 17:52.742
which is throwing some images within you.

17:52.942 --> 17:55.531
Such people are conscious of them:

17:55.731 --> 17:59.007
that there are some images which are throwing these

17:59.207 --> 18:06.694
subtle ideas within you,

18:06.894 --> 18:19.519
[and that] they are erupting some new commotion within you;

18:19.719 --> 18:22.511
and once you start feeling them

18:22.711 --> 18:27.711
you are compelled to put them down somewhere.

18:28.407 --> 18:32.785
That’s how the poets are created, musicians are created,

18:32.985 --> 18:37.603
great masters are created.

18:39.142 --> 18:46.274
Now the fashioning of these subtle ideas is another job.

18:47.274 --> 18:51.108
But the beauty of these subtle ideas is this:

18:51.308 --> 18:55.077
that they are universal in nature.

18:55.277 --> 19:00.366
If they were not, they would not be so much appealing to everyone.

19:00.566 --> 19:05.180
So there is something universal in those,

19:05.380 --> 19:07.820
and that universality,

19:08.020 --> 19:13.070
when manifested or fashioned into some expression,

19:13.270 --> 19:20.020
then it is absorbed universally.

19:28.274 --> 19:35.651
Now it depends on the person how much he is closer

19:35.851 --> 19:40.846
to those images and to the image of his Spirit.

19:41.046 --> 19:45.801
If such a person is a realised-soul,

19:46.001 --> 19:50.918
then the expression is heavenly.

19:51.118 --> 19:56.289
The fashioning of those expressions, of course,

19:56.489 --> 20:01.429
is determined by the surroundings,

20:01.629 --> 20:05.257
the different atmosphere,

20:05.457 --> 20:10.941
the traditions, and all that, in which the people have lived.

20:13.740 --> 20:15.705
That is the fashioning part of it.

20:15.905 --> 20:18.806
But the universal essence of everything,

20:19.006 --> 20:24.967
that element which is universal,

20:25.167 --> 20:31.186
is manifested in a particular fashion.

20:31.386 --> 20:39.967
The more a person is nearer to his Self –

20:40.167 --> 20:44.937
even the fashioning is very universal in nature.

20:45.137 --> 20:52.001
Then such a person doesn’t try

20:52.201 --> 20:59.157
to be moulded by traditions so much.

20:59.357 --> 21:06.800
But the traditions which have come through meditativeness,

21:07.000 --> 21:14.525
or through realised-souls,

21:14.725 --> 21:20.952
definitely give him a better chance of expression.

21:24.938 --> 21:28.618
So the fashioning also evolves, gradually, in every country,

21:28.818 --> 21:32.706
in every place,

21:32.906 --> 21:35.550
till it reaches the point

21:35.750 --> 21:42.170
where people start understanding them in meditation.

21:42.370 --> 21:45.232
Now there are two types of fashioning:

21:45.432 --> 21:48.701
one is the fashioning that comes from outside,

21:48.901 --> 21:51.733
the other from inside.

21:51.933 --> 21:55.522
The fashioning that comes from inside could be

21:55.722 --> 22:01.863
the teachings of the great masters, who are realised-souls,

22:02.063 --> 22:09.644
and your own understanding of the work of these great masters.

22:09.844 --> 22:11.980
The other style could be that

22:12.180 --> 22:15.504
you see what people have been producing, all of them,

22:15.704 --> 22:20.876
and you gather out of that, and fashion
your manifestation accordingly.

22:21.077 --> 22:23.411
In the second type of thing they may be realised,

22:23.612 --> 22:26.891
they may not be realised.

22:27.091 --> 22:30.953
Now when we go to Sahaj Yoga,

22:31.153 --> 22:36.692
even a person who is not a genius,
who has never been a genius,

22:36.892 --> 22:45.350
who had no idea of any special expression in life,

22:45.550 --> 22:50.568
can get Realisation and of the highest type.

22:50.768 --> 22:53.178
Maybe much more than a genius,

22:53.379 --> 22:56.588
because genius might have become a geni-ass by now!

22:56.788 --> 22:59.428
His ego must have bloated out, he might be a geni-ass

22:59.629 --> 23:03.499
instead of a genius!

23:06.897 --> 23:13.565
But a Sahaj Yogi, when he gets his Realisation,

23:13.765 --> 23:19.816
his Realisation is a sign,

23:20.016 --> 23:24.732
not of his subtleties,

23:24.932 --> 23:31.292
but of his Kundalini – in what condition She is.

23:32.761 --> 23:40.742
If the Kundalini is absolutely frozen

23:40.942 --> 23:49.184
that means a person has no desire to have Realisation,

23:49.384 --> 23:53.660
he’s coming to Sahaj Yog to make some money out of it

23:53.860 --> 23:56.045
or to make some name out of it,

23:56.245 --> 24:03.155
or to be - he could be a burglar coming as a Sahaj Yogi

24:03.355 --> 24:07.855
to burgle away, say, my shoes!

24:10.144 --> 24:18.504
Such a person can be very difficult for Realisation.

24:18.704 --> 24:22.122
But maybe with some people,

24:22.322 --> 24:28.201
who have some basic problems also,

24:28.401 --> 24:33.284
can have their Kundalini completely frozen out.

24:36.836 --> 24:42.090
But people of very ordinary appearances,

24:42.290 --> 24:48.412
of very ordinary life,

24:48.612 --> 24:54.019
could be very subtle,

24:54.219 --> 24:57.219
much more than all these genius

24:57.420 --> 25:00.816
and geni-asses and geniuses put together –

25:01.016 --> 25:06.142
because they can feel their Self.

25:06.900 --> 25:10.095
Such people do not cheat themselves or others –

25:10.296 --> 25:13.110
no question.

25:13.908 --> 25:20.859
Their whole attitude towards Sahaj Yog

25:21.059 --> 25:30.849
is like a person who is dying and gasping for air.

25:31.049 --> 25:35.408
They are just struggling to get the Truth.

25:36.166 --> 25:41.397
They have no other interest in life, but to get to the Truth.

25:41.597 --> 25:44.601
Such people could be very strong headed,

25:44.801 --> 25:47.507
could be very different from normal.

25:47.707 --> 25:51.421
They may think many things [to be] stupid. Even just to have a wife

25:51.621 --> 25:56.520
and children and family is quite stupid isn’t it?

25:57.000 --> 26:01.589
That’s not the end of life.

26:01.789 --> 26:04.253
It’s quite a stupid thing to do.

26:04.453 --> 26:10.310
I don’t say that you give up that, but it’s not the end of life.

26:10.510 --> 26:14.607
It’s all right, it’s a part of it,

26:14.807 --> 26:17.104
[but] you are not to be lost in it.

26:17.304 --> 26:21.143
We believe that marriage is important and we believe that,

26:21.343 --> 26:25.331
in the marriage, husband, wife should be very much

26:25.531 --> 26:27.992
understanding each other.

26:28.192 --> 26:30.442
There should be love between the two.

26:30.643 --> 26:32.643
There should be enjoyment,

26:32.880 --> 26:36.855
so that the children also feel the security of the family,

26:37.055 --> 26:40.394
so the society improves.

26:40.594 --> 26:44.394
All this is all right, but that’s not the end of it.

26:44.594 --> 26:47.985
In India you will find many families like that:

26:48.185 --> 26:51.376
where a husband, wife are carrying on nicely,

26:51.576 --> 26:54.415
children are nice, their money is in the bank;

26:54.615 --> 26:56.969
when they die, the money goes to the children;

26:57.169 --> 27:01.282
then the children are married nicely, then they have their children,

27:01.482 --> 27:03.505
money goes to the bank;

27:03.706 --> 27:07.014
when they die, the money goes to them.

27:07.214 --> 27:10.748
It goes on day in and day out.

27:10.948 --> 27:13.295
[It’s] nothing, it’s so mundane.

27:13.495 --> 27:15.729
That doesn’t mean I believe in divorces.

27:15.956 --> 27:19.709
Of course, that’s something nonsensical.

27:19.909 --> 27:23.479
But to be married means just you have entered into life.

27:23.679 --> 27:27.026
At least you should enter into life!

27:27.226 --> 27:31.523
That is important as far as entering is concerned.

27:31.724 --> 27:39.325
Basisc. But that is just the basic, that’s not the end of life!

27:40.567 --> 27:44.828
If you are a subtler person you will not think

27:45.028 --> 27:49.380
what is your advantage monetarily, or what you are doing,

27:49.580 --> 27:52.318
what is the thing, what gain you have got.

27:52.518 --> 27:56.638
Of course you will see that as yoga is established,

27:56.838 --> 28:01.451
your kshema will be established, your well-being will be established.

28:01.651 --> 28:07.504
You will see that, clearly. It is to be seen,

28:07.704 --> 28:11.269
to be thankful.

28:11.469 --> 28:15.262
And the kshema is all right,

28:15.462 --> 28:24.185
because you should not have worry akshema,

28:24.385 --> 28:29.974
but you should have free time to devote yourself

28:30.174 --> 28:34.169
to meditation and to Sahaj Yog:

28:34.369 --> 28:38.513
so that you don’t have too much worry.

28:38.713 --> 28:40.935
That’s how the kshema comes in.

28:41.135 --> 28:44.943
But when the kshema comes in also, one may start

28:45.143 --> 28:49.672
going into the same circle of greediness,

28:49.872 --> 28:53.907
[of] having more and more money, more and more this,

28:54.107 --> 28:58.556
better clothes, better house, [of] how to get this:

28:58.756 --> 29:02.772
this circle may start.

29:03.592 --> 29:07.345
There’s no end to it,

29:07.545 --> 29:11.992
so you have to cut it down. I am not saying

29:12.192 --> 29:16.289
that you just have one dress

29:16.489 --> 29:20.600
and all your life you end up with one dress;

29:20.800 --> 29:23.327
it doesn’t mean that. Because you know if I say anything,

29:23.527 --> 29:25.159
people will shoot off to the other end.

29:25.360 --> 29:28.202
I am trying to keep it in the centre

29:28.402 --> 29:31.585
[so] that not too much attention will be required on one side

29:31.785 --> 29:37.379
or on the other; of indulgences or of asceticism – none of these.

29:37.580 --> 29:43.021
You are not to renounce anything or neither
you have to indulge into anything:

29:43.221 --> 29:49.016
but feel your subtleties, feed them, nourish them,

29:49.216 --> 29:55.435
look after them. You should be proud of your subtleties:

29:56.849 --> 30:01.172
that you have these subtler values, while others don’t have,

30:01.372 --> 30:05.046
and that itself will be so self-sustaining

30:05.247 --> 30:09.520
that you can withhold all those values

30:09.720 --> 30:15.363
that you get from your subtleties against the whole world.

30:15.563 --> 30:19.483
Because the world is so fragmented,

30:19.683 --> 30:24.979
so cut off, that everybody feels lonely.

30:25.736 --> 30:28.984
But that does not, by any chance, mean you should be arrogant

30:29.184 --> 30:34.570
to others, you should be fighting with others – no!

30:34.770 --> 30:38.920
But in darkness a light shines.

30:39.120 --> 30:43.389
The whole is darkness. If the light accepts the darkness,

30:43.589 --> 30:46.881
then it becomes darkness! So the light must accept that:

30:47.081 --> 30:53.863
“I am the light, and I am the path,” and should stand up.

30:55.558 --> 30:59.781
That does not in any way mean any arrogance to others,

30:59.981 --> 31:04.226
any showing-off to others, but it is the Light.

31:04.426 --> 31:10.076
And the Light, by itself, emits.

31:13.302 --> 31:19.669
When this happens to you,

31:19.869 --> 31:25.107
you will not hate yourself first of all,

31:25.307 --> 31:29.266
but you will love and respect yourself

31:29.466 --> 31:36.281
and respect the virtues in you and not your grossness.

31:36.481 --> 31:41.003
Kundalini Itself makes you subtler and subtler.

31:41.203 --> 31:47.016
But if you are a stone what can Kundalini do?

31:50.799 --> 31:56.756
Now it is for you to see where you are stone.

31:56.956 --> 32:01.596
There should be a lot of heart searching.

32:02.596 --> 32:09.794
The greatest stone-age is nowadays.

32:09.994 --> 32:13.723
Heart is like a stone!

32:13.923 --> 32:16.981
It doesn’t move.

32:17.181 --> 32:20.052
When talking to others,

32:20.253 --> 32:22.794
it doesn’t move.

32:23.013 --> 32:25.977
It has no ripple in it, there’s no joy in it.

32:26.177 --> 32:30.456
It’s like a stone sitting there to hit everyone.

32:30.656 --> 32:32.656
You see anybody sees you, “Oh Bala! He’s coming!

32:32.857 --> 32:34.857
Go from the other road!” “Who?”

32:35.058 --> 32:39.078
“That fellow with the stone heart!”

32:40.811 --> 32:43.498
And you feel you are all right, you are a very good person

32:43.699 --> 32:45.699
because you are stone hearted.

32:45.900 --> 32:49.260
You think you can dominate the whole world because you are stone hearted,

32:49.460 --> 32:52.762
you can give psychological treatments to others, keep quiet,

32:52.962 --> 32:56.262
don’t talk to anyone, shout at others and do whatever you please,

32:56.462 --> 32:59.908
because you have a stone heart.

33:00.551 --> 33:03.718
Nothing happens to your stone there.

33:03.918 --> 33:07.868
Now this stone heartedness

33:08.068 --> 33:16.058
is the sign that you should not be any more in Sahaj Yog.

33:17.926 --> 33:23.639
You must have a heart as your Mother has:

33:23.839 --> 33:26.819
pulsating with love,

33:27.019 --> 33:31.232
with compassion, with joy,

33:31.432 --> 33:35.661
with happiness, with giving.

33:35.861 --> 33:40.858
That should be the attitude,

33:41.058 --> 33:44.124
not rationality, nothing.

33:44.324 --> 33:48.593
It is the feeling:

33:48.793 --> 33:51.967
feeling for the pains of others,

33:52.167 --> 33:58.811
feeling for their longings and feeling for their aspirations.

33:59.011 --> 34:05.405
Just feeling them within yourself

34:05.605 --> 34:19.484
is their desire to be the Whole,

34:19.684 --> 34:26.359
to be the Ocean Itself,

34:26.559 --> 34:30.909
itself is so fulfilling.

34:32.349 --> 34:37.724
We should not have our ideals among ourselves.

34:38.112 --> 34:40.156
Like, “She does this so why should I do?”

34:40.357 --> 34:44.795
“He does this so why should I do?” It’s very mediocre.

34:44.995 --> 34:50.400
It’s a very low-grade business to see others,

34:50.600 --> 34:54.088
to worry about others, to talk about others.

34:54.288 --> 34:58.985
It’s extremely low grade.

34:59.781 --> 35:06.621
A person who is of a calibre

35:06.821 --> 35:09.613
has his standards so much higher

35:09.813 --> 35:16.313
that he cannot compare himself with others.

35:17.617 --> 35:22.448
It’s really true. So, if I start comparing myself with you,

35:22.648 --> 35:26.120
what will be my position?

35:26.320 --> 35:31.132
I mean, I can’t do it!

35:32.196 --> 35:34.655
Then you will say, “It’s all right for you Mother!” It’s perfect,

35:34.855 --> 35:37.691
I agree, it’s all right for me as I am.

35:37.891 --> 35:42.726
But you can be like me also.

35:48.054 --> 35:56.643
But if I start comparing and thinking, “Oh God, what is this?”

35:56.843 --> 36:00.087
then I should give up doing anything, thinking,

36:00.287 --> 36:04.585
“Where have I come?”

36:05.272 --> 36:08.682
But when you know that

36:08.882 --> 36:13.897
you are not comparing, you are just giving.

36:14.773 --> 36:20.409
The question of comparison should not arise at all,

36:20.609 --> 36:22.971
at all.

36:23.171 --> 36:26.259
It’s just feeling.

36:26.459 --> 36:29.618
I just feel.

36:29.818 --> 36:34.255
In the same way you feel each other.

36:37.717 --> 36:40.845
Not in an artificial, courteous way:

36:41.045 --> 36:43.126
[like] some people think that

36:43.326 --> 36:45.409
if they have given their seat to someone

36:45.609 --> 36:48.550
they have been really the generous people,

36:48.750 --> 36:53.242
the greatest generous people!

36:55.787 --> 36:59.369
Just be yourself now: let’s see.

36:59.569 --> 37:03.986
Just be yourself, and that you are the Light.

37:04.186 --> 37:08.424
What is the comparison?

37:17.212 --> 37:23.697
The comparison exists when our calibre is low.

37:25.220 --> 37:30.423
If it is 24 carat gold, what is the comparison?

37:30.623 --> 37:32.759
It’s absolute.

37:32.959 --> 37:37.215
If you are at an absolute point, there’s no comparison.

37:37.415 --> 37:42.598
So try to see that your calibre is that,

37:42.798 --> 37:46.471
that you are of that calibre

37:46.671 --> 37:49.425
and don’t worry about gross people.

37:49.625 --> 37:51.608
Gross are gross [and] will remain gross:

37:51.824 --> 37:57.025
you just don’t worry about them. You [should] keep your calibre all right.

37:57.541 --> 38:03.463
And that is what is the most essential part of Sahaja Yoga.

38:04.127 --> 38:07.789
Thank you very much.

38:11.494 --> 38:12.493
- Huh?

38:12.694 --> 38:15.032
They always tell me that You are actually God ,

38:15.233 --> 38:19.217
the Father God Himself.

38:19.418 --> 38:21.283
Well I can’t see that at all.

38:21.483 --> 38:25.944
All right, now put your hand towards me. Ask the question.

38:27.124 --> 38:29.124
The simplest computer.

38:29.325 --> 38:33.812
Work out your computer and ask the question, finished.

38:36.874 --> 38:41.197
That, “She is the ‘E’, means She is the One

38:41.397 --> 38:47.083
who is the desire of God Almighty.  the meaning?

38:47.841 --> 38:52.789
She is the power of God,

38:52.989 --> 38:56.016
and it is only She who incarnates.”

38:56.216 --> 39:03.743
If you read the Vedas, it is said that She created Her child,

39:03.943 --> 39:14.974
and the first sound that was created was the child.

39:16.092 --> 39:24.709
And that sound is the sound what we call as Brahma,

39:24.909 --> 39:29.248
or the Logos, as they call it.

39:36.615 --> 39:41.615
So now, what is the difference between God and God’s desire?

39:41.815 --> 39:46.425
What is the difference between sun and sunlight?

39:49.260 --> 39:54.068
What is the difference between moon and moonlight?

39:54.268 --> 39:59.343
What is the difference between the word and the meaning?

40:09.957 --> 40:16.905
So the God Almighty whom people understand,

40:17.105 --> 40:21.138
is just a witness.

40:21.338 --> 40:27.307
The day these two things will meet, there won’t be any world left.

40:29.943 --> 40:34.141
Till they are separated, all these things happened.

40:34.341 --> 40:40.084
When they meet, and merge into each other, there’s nothing left,

40:40.284 --> 40:45.519
He just becomes the sound, Brahma.

40:56.049 --> 40:59.294
We cannot understand these things, because we have never seen

40:59.494 --> 41:04.284
two things [which are] that merged together as God and His Power.

41:04.484 --> 41:07.823
We cannot understand

41:08.023 --> 41:14.068
anything like that because there is no parallel.

41:17.740 --> 41:22.358
Now, you can rationally also see things, that:

41:22.558 --> 41:25.132
people, when they bend before me,

41:25.333 --> 41:28.441
their Kundalini starts moving.

41:28.642 --> 41:30.876
It is written in the scriptures [that]

41:31.077 --> 41:35.080
only at the feet of Adi Shakti this would happen.

41:35.280 --> 41:38.952
Not only that, but you people

41:39.153 --> 41:43.307
who have not been to any austere life or anything,

41:43.507 --> 41:45.745
have got Realisation

41:45.956 --> 41:51.717
and that your own power is giving them Realisation. Isn’t it?

41:51.917 --> 41:58.740
There is no one in the whole world today [

41:58.940 --> 42:01.489
even though] there may be some realised-souls,

42:01.689 --> 42:05.543
who can give, the way you give, Realisation.

42:05.743 --> 42:09.864
You go and talk to some great gurus:

42:10.064 --> 42:12.742
they are jealous of you.

42:12.942 --> 42:17.914
They know who I am, they have told people who I am,

42:18.114 --> 42:21.140
but they are jealous.

42:21.340 --> 42:24.340
They don’t understand why of all the things

42:24.541 --> 42:26.541
I have given you these powers while they don’t have.

42:26.742 --> 42:28.742
They can’t give Realisation the way you give,

42:28.943 --> 42:31.842
in a second like this; nobody can.

42:32.042 --> 42:34.528
You can go and have a look at them.

42:34.729 --> 42:38.529
They are great people no doubt.

42:38.729 --> 42:43.003
But your Kundalini works like a jet.

42:43.203 --> 42:48.909
They move like elephants,

42:49.109 --> 42:51.666
from one chakra to another chakra.

42:51.866 --> 42:54.866
The Kundalini doesn’t move that way as it moves [in you],

42:55.067 --> 42:59.499
because I have given you the authority.

43:02.255 --> 43:07.211
You can go and meet them and they will tell you.

43:07.411 --> 43:11.204
There are thousands of people they have got [as] disciples,

43:11.404 --> 43:13.509
but they don’t send them to me.

43:13.710 --> 43:15.710
They said, “Mother You will find your calibre [of people].

43:15.911 --> 43:18.630
These gross people, you leave it to us.

43:18.830 --> 43:20.845
We’ll manage them. We’ll send them later on.

43:21.046 --> 43:23.975
Just now you find your subtle people.”

43:24.175 --> 43:26.815
Why Sahaja Yogis are few [is] because there are

43:27.016 --> 43:29.694
very few subtle people in this world of that calibre.

43:29.894 --> 43:32.509
That’s why I am always requesting you that:

43:32.710 --> 43:35.419
do not divert your attention here and there.

43:35.619 --> 43:38.619
Settle down. Become good Sahaja Yogis. Unless and until

43:38.820 --> 43:41.419
you really become good Sahaja Yogis

43:41.619 --> 43:45.973
I cannot move to the second strata.

43:46.528 --> 43:48.653
Because the first strata is not yet settled down.

43:48.854 --> 43:51.125
They are worried about nonsensical things.

43:51.325 --> 43:56.641
I mean I just, sometimes, feel very unhappy to see that

43:56.841 --> 44:03.141
you fight among yourselves. This is something so painful,

44:03.341 --> 44:05.291
that you say harsh words to each other.

44:05.492 --> 44:11.089
I mean you are the cream for me.

44:14.401 --> 44:17.131
You go and ask any one of the gurus,

44:17.332 --> 44:23.936
if they can move the Kundalini on their fingers as you do!

44:26.862 --> 44:31.919
These powers cannot be given by an ordinary person.

44:32.119 --> 44:36.896
I look ordinary, no doubt; I have to.

44:37.096 --> 44:42.064
But also you have seen me in other forms;

44:42.264 --> 44:45.264
that’s not important.

44:45.506 --> 44:48.009
The important thing is [that] you should see your own transformation

44:48.209 --> 44:52.140
and how many powers are manifesting.

44:52.567 --> 44:54.530
If you go and tell somebody that,

44:54.731 --> 44:57.542
“I have started giving Realisation and raising Kundalini.”

44:57.742 --> 45:02.257
They will say, “You are mad! How can it be? Impossible!”

45:02.457 --> 45:04.425
Nobody is going to believe you at all.

45:04.626 --> 45:07.173
You have got it so easily:

45:07.374 --> 45:12.454
why? Because I recognise certain subtleties in you.

45:16.754 --> 45:19.457
These gurus recognise me. They know about me.

45:19.658 --> 45:21.937
They know who I am. They are telling others.

45:22.137 --> 45:25.911
There are so many of them like that.

45:26.216 --> 45:29.195
I told you the story of the lady here, American lady.

45:29.395 --> 45:32.453
She might come sometimes. I think you met her isn’t it?

45:32.653 --> 45:36.437
Some of you have met her. She went to Rangoon

45:36.637 --> 45:41.421
and there she went to meet some very great, high soul

45:41.621 --> 45:45.230
who was living on a mountain and he would not meet many people.

45:45.430 --> 45:49.628
But she went there and he really respected her.

45:49.828 --> 45:51.906
And when she came in he said,

45:52.107 --> 45:56.566
“I am going to sit at a lower level than yours.”

45:56.766 --> 45:59.766
So she could not understand. He said,

45:59.967 --> 46:03.201
“Because you have seen Mother with your own eyes. I haven’t.

46:03.401 --> 46:08.393
I will have to die to come and see Her again.”

46:10.921 --> 46:14.788
And then she was surprised.

46:17.187 --> 46:21.065
But first of all know that you have got these powers within you.

46:21.265 --> 46:24.265
Then know that you have got them

46:24.531 --> 46:29.172
because I have chosen you.

46:34.214 --> 46:37.490
All right? Good!

46:37.690 --> 46:40.300
See now!

46:41.120 --> 46:45.309
Only thing: you get rid of your egos, which give you ideas.

46:45.509 --> 46:48.372
You see sometimes they come like big balloons!

46:48.572 --> 46:53.713
So tell yourself, “Oh mister ego, please get out!

46:54.129 --> 47:01.866
These powers I have got because Mother has chosen me,

47:02.066 --> 47:07.943
has loved me, has nourished me

47:08.144 --> 47:13.775
and has accepted me as Her child.”

47:14.572 --> 47:17.583
It’s a fact!

47:18.060 --> 47:21.204
Nobody can believe that you can give Realisation I tell you.

47:21.404 --> 47:24.352
You go and tell anybody.

47:24.552 --> 47:31.004
You should! But they are not going to believe you.

47:35.574 --> 47:39.466
If this flowers says that, “I can become

47:39.666 --> 47:43.099
the lamp in the lighthouse.”

47:43.299 --> 47:47.425
Nobody’s going to believe it,

47:47.625 --> 47:51.003
because the light in the lighthouse is made in a special factory

47:51.203 --> 47:53.800
with a special this, and a special that.

47:54.000 --> 47:58.550
But supposing this flower says so, or if this flower says that,

47:58.750 --> 48:03.401
“I can cure your diseases.”

48:03.601 --> 48:08.547
Nobody would believe; but it may.

48:11.586 --> 48:16.659
When something fantastic happens

48:16.859 --> 48:20.781
you have to believe that there is Divine acting

48:20.981 --> 48:25.661
and acting so dynamically.

48:34.063 --> 48:39.129
Only thing [is]: do not waste your energies in gross hankerings

48:39.329 --> 48:44.225
and gross wanderings and ramblings.

48:44.897 --> 48:48.916
Try to be subtler and subtler.

48:49.116 --> 48:54.365
There is nothing that I have to ask for.

48:54.565 --> 48:59.037
Now you think about it from God’s point of view.

48:59.237 --> 49:01.622
You are to be given Realisation: first job.

49:01.822 --> 49:06.585
It’s a headache you know!

49:07.319 --> 49:10.346
Somebody has to take up the headache of giving Realisation.

49:10.546 --> 49:13.956
It is much easier to be crucified once,

49:14.156 --> 49:18.402
but to be giving Realisation hundred times,

49:18.602 --> 49:24.219
to all kinds of funny Kundalinis to be raised,

49:24.419 --> 49:27.255
you cannot imagine!

49:27.456 --> 49:32.017
And then after giving Realisation to tell you all about it:

49:32.217 --> 49:35.217
to decode all the chakras, to show you all the chakras,

49:35.418 --> 49:39.546
to tell you all about Deities, these archetypes and everything.

49:39.746 --> 49:46.108
And every word of it is true and acts and works.

49:46.308 --> 49:50.436
You have experimented and found out.

49:50.636 --> 49:54.927
Somebody has to come down.

49:55.896 --> 50:02.344
It has been my lot to come.

50:02.544 --> 50:05.255
I don’t mind, as I told the other day,

50:05.455 --> 50:07.927
any one of you takes my seat I’ll be very happy

50:08.127 --> 50:12.927
to be a Sahaja Yogi sitting down like that!

50:13.127 --> 50:17.701
Really, I tell you! I will be the happiest person.

50:17.901 --> 50:22.240
I’ll give you five garlands like this

50:22.440 --> 50:26.868
and all the flowers from the market I will bring for you,

50:27.068 --> 50:34.005
if you could sit here and do the job for me.

50:34.614 --> 50:39.868
It’s very easy to doubt, but can you do the job?

50:40.068 --> 50:42.727
No, you cannot.

50:42.927 --> 50:46.716
This is the trouble with the Western mind is,

50:46.916 --> 50:49.857
that it doubts.

50:50.057 --> 50:52.997
What are you doubting about?

50:53.197 --> 50:57.316
What is there to doubt?

50:58.144 --> 51:03.131
I cannot doubt myself, that’s very difficult.

51:03.331 --> 51:08.026
When you know that this is the tea, how can you doubt?

51:08.226 --> 51:13.616
Now if you doubt, what can I do? How to prove it?

51:17.799 --> 51:24.252
Best way is to understand my love.

51:25.463 --> 51:29.103
Through that you will understand me better.

51:29.303 --> 51:34.502
It’s much easier to understand me through your heart

51:34.702 --> 51:41.786
than through your brains, because I am very good at blasting them;

51:41.986 --> 51:44.560
and I play about with you, lots of things,

51:44.760 --> 51:51.421
by which I really give you a very difficult time.

51:51.621 --> 51:54.913
Because if you start thinking, I make you think more.

51:55.113 --> 51:58.803
If you start doubting, I make you doubt more.

51:59.003 --> 52:04.171
So best thing is to see. As I told the other day that,

52:04.371 --> 52:06.851
whatever is in the next room, it’s better to go and see

52:07.051 --> 52:11.687
than to sit down here and doubt,

52:11.887 --> 52:16.467
or to accept it and sit down here. No! Go and see for yourself.

52:16.667 --> 52:18.667
And you have seen it yourself.

52:18.868 --> 52:22.467
But just think how tremendous it is.

52:22.667 --> 52:26.047
Just sit down and think,

52:26.247 --> 52:30.250
how great it is, how dynamic it is!

52:30.450 --> 52:35.349
That you have seen it with your own eyes!

52:35.896 --> 52:40.115
Just think,

52:43.506 --> 52:50.026
that you have felt it. That you are the people who have got it.

52:50.226 --> 52:54.637
You are the first few who have known it.

52:54.837 --> 52:57.704
There may be thousands and thousands later

52:57.905 --> 53:01.723
and the whole universe may take it up, but you are the first few.

53:01.923 --> 53:04.114
Improve your calibre.

53:04.314 --> 53:07.454
Come up!

53:18.429 --> 53:20.675
I think if you can give me leave, I would like to go

53:20.875 --> 53:24.393
because the whole day I have been really working very hard.

53:24.593 --> 53:28.908
I did my cooking and did that. Now, what’s the matter with you?

53:29.109 --> 53:33.675
You, still more? Still more?

53:33.875 --> 53:41.500
Better! Keep like that! All right. Now can I take your leave?
