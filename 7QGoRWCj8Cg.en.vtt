Subtlety. Dollis Hill, London (UK), 8 June 1980.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:16.511
It is only possible for people who are of a subtler nature

00:00:16.711 --> 00:00:25.378
to understand the value of Sahaj Yoga,

00:00:25.578 --> 00:00:30.519
to hold to the values of Sahaj Yog,

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:37.699
and to retain it in this fragmented world.

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:42.729
The world is fragmented

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:49.875
and everybody is acting towards one’s own destruction.

00:00:52.698 --> 00:01:00.798
All the values which people follow are gross values.

00:01:00.998 --> 00:01:06.103
Most of the values are absolutely gross.

00:01:06.303 --> 00:01:11.942
So for Sahaj Yoga we have to have people

00:01:12.142 --> 00:01:20.165
who are trying to justify their subtleties.

00:01:22.153 --> 00:01:28.243
Such subtler people

00:01:28.443 --> 00:01:34.157
have always been

00:01:34.357 --> 00:01:38.180
a little different from the mundane crowd;

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:44.551
and these people

00:01:44.752 --> 00:01:53.387
always express themselves in such a manner

00:01:53.588 --> 00:01:59.919
that their existence itself suggests

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:10.953
that they are trying to cement the whole world.

00:02:11.153 --> 00:02:16.810
Sort of you can feel that.

00:02:18.125 --> 00:02:25.070
[Marathi]

00:02:29.558 --> 00:02:33.616
Those who can feel

00:02:33.816 --> 00:02:39.493
that there is an element within us

00:02:39.693 --> 00:02:45.556
which makes us laugh at the stupidity of others,

00:02:45.756 --> 00:02:48.940
who may appear to themselves

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.604
to be very seriously doing certain things.

00:02:51.804 --> 00:02:55.319
But to us it seems as if it’s rather stupid to

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.337
waste their lives.

00:02:59.538 --> 00:03:04.893
This is a calibre of different people.

00:03:05.093 --> 00:03:07.796
First these people, with that calibre

00:03:07.997 --> 00:03:10.038
and that dynamism within them,

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:16.469
will be settled in Sahaja Yoga, not the ordinary gross type.

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:22.641
But because our doors are open to everyone,

00:03:22.841 --> 00:03:30.231
because there is no charge or anything, for anything,

00:03:30.431 --> 00:03:34.447
all sorts of people come in.

00:03:35.704 --> 00:03:39.407
And when they come in they don’t know what they want.

00:03:39.607 --> 00:03:45.047
Out of them some could be the grossest of all.

00:03:45.247 --> 00:03:49.320
Some might be just walking in to take out some things,

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.770
just to steal something; possibly.

00:03:54.364 --> 00:03:58.893
I have seen all kinds of people coming to Sahaj Yog.

00:03:59.093 --> 00:04:02.354
Such people when they find that there’s something available,

00:04:02.554 --> 00:04:06.515
they come in and go away.

00:04:06.715 --> 00:04:15.866
Another kind, maybe, which is coming here,

00:04:16.066 --> 00:04:23.258
is the one which is extremely gross,

00:04:23.458 --> 00:04:31.389
but they can think that he can make some liaison work here;

00:04:31.589 --> 00:04:36.474
[that] by having connections with different people

00:04:36.674 --> 00:04:41.356
he can exploit it and make some money out of it.

00:04:41.556 --> 00:04:45.028
So money mindedness is a very gross thing,

00:04:45.228 --> 00:04:48.833
is a very gross thing.

00:04:49.033 --> 00:04:51.634
If people are money minded

00:04:51.853 --> 00:04:57.187
then Sahaja Yoga doesn’t work out well with them.

00:04:57.984 --> 00:05:00.647
If you always think about money, of your insurance,

00:05:00.848 --> 00:05:04.174
about how the carpet is spoiled, this has happened, that happened:

00:05:04.374 --> 00:05:08.950
such people are very difficult.

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.294
But lower than these are the people who come here

00:05:12.494 --> 00:05:17.312
to have some sort of an exploitation out of Sahaj Yog.

00:05:17.512 --> 00:05:21.398
Such gross people also come in,

00:05:21.598 --> 00:05:26.656
and when they find that they cannot work out their plans,

00:05:26.856 --> 00:05:30.684
they get out of it.

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:36.632
Now the third type of people who come here,

00:05:36.832 --> 00:05:42.619
they come for some material gain from Sahaj Yog,

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:46.017
maybe physical gain also: like somebody is sick,

00:05:46.217 --> 00:05:49.376
so they come for their sickness.

00:05:49.576 --> 00:05:52.014
It’s a very gross way of looking at things:

00:05:52.215 --> 00:05:57.835
is to come to Sahaj Yog for getting cured.

00:05:59.327 --> 00:06:03.921
So when they get cured they disappear.

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.354
Quite stupid isn’t it!

00:06:14.136 --> 00:06:18.366
Then some people come with the idea that,

00:06:18.566 --> 00:06:22.437
“Maybe, with Mother’s blessings, our financial problems will be solved.”

00:06:22.637 --> 00:06:25.606
Only with that idea!

00:06:25.806 --> 00:06:29.130
Then they also get their financial problems solved,

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.611
and they get out.

00:06:37.062 --> 00:06:40.268
But some of them do not,

00:06:40.468 --> 00:06:47.453
some of them cannot manage what they want to have,

00:06:47.653 --> 00:06:51.926
then they get upset.

00:06:54.994 --> 00:07:01.595
Now the best calibre, of the subtlest form,

00:07:01.795 --> 00:07:10.841
is that which is just seeking Sahaj Yog,

00:07:11.041 --> 00:07:18.976
which is just seeking union with God, nothing else;

00:07:19.176 --> 00:07:23.027
that’s the best calibre.

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:35.588
That calibre works hard.

00:07:36.674 --> 00:07:41.923
It has very concentrated effort.

00:07:42.123 --> 00:07:47.233
It understands Sahaj Yog very quick.

00:07:51.327 --> 00:07:55.994
[The] only thing is that,

00:07:56.194 --> 00:08:03.166
because of Western habit of thinking,

00:08:03.366 --> 00:08:11.303
some of the people, though they have a calibre,

00:08:11.503 --> 00:08:16.506
circulate around themselves;

00:08:16.706 --> 00:08:21.774
they go on thinking about it, discussing about it,

00:08:21.974 --> 00:08:24.821
arguing about it,

00:08:25.021 --> 00:08:29.601
and then they become stationed at a point.

00:08:29.801 --> 00:08:35.523
(laughing) Otherwise it goes little round and round itself.

00:08:35.723 --> 00:08:40.726
They have a calibre, they have a height, they definitely have.

00:08:40.927 --> 00:08:46.458
They have that weight in them, they can feel their element,

00:08:46.657 --> 00:08:48.973
but still they go on, as a habit,

00:08:49.174 --> 00:08:54.996
because they are used to it; they go on encircling round and round and round.

00:08:55.196 --> 00:09:00.063
They have to steady themselves.

00:09:03.297 --> 00:09:07.968
But

00:09:08.168 --> 00:09:16.482
the calibre of a person

00:09:16.682 --> 00:09:25.908
who just wants to be, to become,

00:09:26.108 --> 00:09:31.009
can never be deterred by anything,

00:09:31.209 --> 00:09:35.017
because he is subtle, in a way;

00:09:35.217 --> 00:09:40.174
in his lifetime he feels the subtleties of the unconscious.

00:09:40.374 --> 00:09:46.933
He has felt his archetype images of these Deities.

00:09:47.133 --> 00:09:50.433
He has known them.

00:09:50.633 --> 00:09:55.821
He had these eruptions within him.

00:09:56.290 --> 00:10:03.957
He identifies and he recognises

00:10:04.157 --> 00:10:08.604
the subtleties that he has felt

00:10:08.804 --> 00:10:12.151
and he tallies them with Sahaj Yog,

00:10:12.351 --> 00:10:17.775
and Sahaja Yoga gets him like that.

00:10:24.744 --> 00:10:32.728
Now these subtleties which I am describing to you,

00:10:32.928 --> 00:10:40.468
come to you not through your mental effort of this lifetime,

00:10:40.668 --> 00:10:46.767
but comes to you from the experiences of many lives

00:10:46.967 --> 00:10:52.056
you have gone through

00:10:52.256 --> 00:10:58.271
and as soon as you come near Sahaja Yoga,

00:10:58.471 --> 00:11:02.083
you start sucking.

00:11:02.283 --> 00:11:06.322
That is the best calibre.

00:11:06.775 --> 00:11:10.833
But, because the door is open ajar,

00:11:11.033 --> 00:11:13.708
the grossest of gross also can come in.

00:11:13.908 --> 00:11:18.931
But sometimes they come this way and go back the same way.

00:11:19.131 --> 00:11:23.251
Some of them, they come half way and rush back.

00:11:23.451 --> 00:11:28.470
Some of them come inside and get out from the other side.

00:11:29.274 --> 00:11:36.649
But those who stay are the people who are subtler by nature.

00:11:40.271 --> 00:11:44.454
It is a very subtle happening.

00:11:44.654 --> 00:11:49.412
If you have lost your subtleties:

00:11:49.612 --> 00:11:51.612
say, some people as I said,

00:11:51.813 --> 00:11:55.325
even doing hard work with your fingers, you become insensitive.

00:11:55.526 --> 00:11:59.786
Even physical disrespect to your fingers,

00:11:59.986 --> 00:12:06.798
you become a little bit insensitive,

00:12:08.459 --> 00:12:13.212
[so that] even when you get your Realisation,

00:12:13.412 --> 00:12:17.571
you may not feel the vibrations that good.

00:12:17.771 --> 00:12:19.557
But that is not so important.

00:12:19.758 --> 00:12:25.393
Of course, vibrations you must feel for Realisation.

00:12:26.721 --> 00:12:30.632
But maybe due to some external reasons also,

00:12:30.832 --> 00:12:37.280
or maybe due to some physical problem,

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:43.627
you may get

00:12:43.827 --> 00:12:49.307
a situation where you may not feel the vibrations so much.

00:12:49.507 --> 00:12:51.853
But doubts would not rise in your minds

00:12:52.053 --> 00:12:55.275
because there are no vibrations.

00:12:55.475 --> 00:12:59.033
You would just think that, “Yes the vibrations are not there,

00:12:59.233 --> 00:13:02.353
I must get my Vishuddhi Chakra all right.

00:13:02.553 --> 00:13:06.202
But it is there.”

00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:15.322
And even if the doubts come in,

00:13:15.522 --> 00:13:21.326
a subtle person will fight it,

00:13:21.526 --> 00:13:27.589
will argue it out, but a gross person won’t.

00:13:32.268 --> 00:13:39.491
The subtle person is a brave man

00:13:39.691 --> 00:13:44.671
and his bravery comes from

00:13:44.871 --> 00:13:51.643
his built in capacity of those subtleties.

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:58.005
He does not succumb to doubts.

00:13:58.205 --> 00:14:04.759
He just sees it [and] he fights it. He does not succumb to it.

00:14:07.618 --> 00:14:09.778
But Sahaja Yoga is such a wonderful thing

00:14:09.979 --> 00:14:14.498
[that] even those people who sometimes looked very gross,

00:14:14.698 --> 00:14:18.812
suddenly came out

00:14:19.012 --> 00:14:23.375
with such a beautiful manifestation of subtleties

00:14:23.575 --> 00:14:27.437
that it is surprising.

00:14:27.637 --> 00:14:31.754
But that is exceptional.

00:14:35.364 --> 00:14:47.060
The mind, and the human brain,

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:52.483
is subtle on certain points and gross on some points;

00:14:52.683 --> 00:14:57.753
it’s most surprising. Maybe [due to the] background, maybe the…

00:14:57.954 --> 00:15:02.132
Can you take her at the back. Because
you know it’s disturbing. Nah?

00:15:02.333 --> 00:15:07.410
Just now take her at the back all right? Good!

00:15:09.907 --> 00:15:13.933
Just give her a seat to sit down all right? Sorry!

00:15:14.133 --> 00:15:17.457
Then I am going to take you in my lap, huh?

00:15:17.657 --> 00:15:22.592
She is very unhappy to leave the place!

00:15:25.701 --> 00:15:31.102
It’s a very subtle subject, you see. Please pay attention.

00:15:33.758 --> 00:15:38.262
If a genius is created.

00:15:38.463 --> 00:15:40.463
Or we can say a...

00:15:40.664 --> 00:15:43.636
They call it a prodigy, but I would call it a genius.

00:15:43.836 --> 00:15:48.027
There’s a difference between a prodigy and a genius:

00:15:48.227 --> 00:15:59.654
prodigy is a person who, for a short time of their lifespan,

00:15:59.854 --> 00:16:02.771
suddenly becomes very talented,

00:16:02.971 --> 00:16:06.076
and after some time the talent goes away.

00:16:06.276 --> 00:16:09.338
And a prodigious person may be mentally

00:16:09.539 --> 00:16:17.095
absolutely very, very low; very low.

00:16:17.295 --> 00:16:28.237
So it is done by some sort of a spirit possession.

00:16:28.437 --> 00:16:33.197
But a person who is a genius

00:16:33.397 --> 00:16:37.720
is a person who has those sensitivities.

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:41.009
The mind which is covered with thoughts,

00:16:41.209 --> 00:16:44.165
which is thickened,

00:16:44.365 --> 00:16:46.571
which is gross,

00:16:46.771 --> 00:16:48.907
can be thinned out at certain points

00:16:49.107 --> 00:16:54.074
and could be very sensitive to certain points.

00:16:54.894 --> 00:17:02.124
For example, some people could be very sensitive to music,

00:17:02.324 --> 00:17:10.129
some could be to art, some could be to human beings,

00:17:10.329 --> 00:17:14.442
some could be to other things

00:17:14.642 --> 00:17:25.384
which might make them rare people.

00:17:26.454 --> 00:17:33.422
But these subtler things,

00:17:33.622 --> 00:17:37.891
which create your personality,

00:17:38.091 --> 00:17:41.848
always indicate, in your being,

00:17:42.048 --> 00:17:46.762
that there is something of the beyond,

00:17:46.962 --> 00:17:52.742
which is throwing some images within you.

00:17:52.942 --> 00:17:55.531
Such people are conscious of them:

00:17:55.731 --> 00:17:59.007
that there are some images which are throwing these

00:17:59.207 --> 00:18:06.694
subtle ideas within you,

00:18:06.894 --> 00:18:19.519
[and that] they are erupting some new commotion within you;

00:18:19.719 --> 00:18:22.511
and once you start feeling them

00:18:22.711 --> 00:18:27.711
you are compelled to put them down somewhere.

00:18:28.407 --> 00:18:32.785
That’s how the poets are created, musicians are created,

00:18:32.985 --> 00:18:37.603
great masters are created.

00:18:39.142 --> 00:18:46.274
Now the fashioning of these subtle ideas is another job.

00:18:47.274 --> 00:18:51.108
But the beauty of these subtle ideas is this:

00:18:51.308 --> 00:18:55.077
that they are universal in nature.

00:18:55.277 --> 00:19:00.366
If they were not, they would not be so much appealing to everyone.

00:19:00.566 --> 00:19:05.180
So there is something universal in those,

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:07.820
and that universality,

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:13.070
when manifested or fashioned into some expression,

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:20.020
then it is absorbed universally.

00:19:28.274 --> 00:19:35.651
Now it depends on the person how much he is closer

00:19:35.851 --> 00:19:40.846
to those images and to the image of his Spirit.

00:19:41.046 --> 00:19:45.801
If such a person is a realised-soul,

00:19:46.001 --> 00:19:50.918
then the expression is heavenly.

00:19:51.118 --> 00:19:56.289
The fashioning of those expressions, of course,

00:19:56.489 --> 00:20:01.429
is determined by the surroundings,

00:20:01.629 --> 00:20:05.257
the different atmosphere,

00:20:05.457 --> 00:20:10.941
the traditions, and all that, in which the people have lived.

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:15.705
That is the fashioning part of it.

00:20:15.905 --> 00:20:18.806
But the universal essence of everything,

00:20:19.006 --> 00:20:24.967
that element which is universal,

00:20:25.167 --> 00:20:31.186
is manifested in a particular fashion.

00:20:31.386 --> 00:20:39.967
The more a person is nearer to his Self –

00:20:40.167 --> 00:20:44.937
even the fashioning is very universal in nature.

00:20:45.137 --> 00:20:52.001
Then such a person doesn’t try

00:20:52.201 --> 00:20:59.157
to be moulded by traditions so much.

00:20:59.357 --> 00:21:06.800
But the traditions which have come through meditativeness,

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:14.525
or through realised-souls,

00:21:14.725 --> 00:21:20.952
definitely give him a better chance of expression.

00:21:24.938 --> 00:21:28.618
So the fashioning also evolves, gradually, in every country,

00:21:28.818 --> 00:21:32.706
in every place,

00:21:32.906 --> 00:21:35.550
till it reaches the point

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:42.170
where people start understanding them in meditation.

00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:45.232
Now there are two types of fashioning:

00:21:45.432 --> 00:21:48.701
one is the fashioning that comes from outside,

00:21:48.901 --> 00:21:51.733
the other from inside.

00:21:51.933 --> 00:21:55.522
The fashioning that comes from inside could be

00:21:55.722 --> 00:22:01.863
the teachings of the great masters, who are realised-souls,

00:22:02.063 --> 00:22:09.644
and your own understanding of the work of these great masters.

00:22:09.844 --> 00:22:11.980
The other style could be that

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:15.504
you see what people have been producing, all of them,

00:22:15.704 --> 00:22:20.876
and you gather out of that, and fashion
your manifestation accordingly.

00:22:21.077 --> 00:22:23.411
In the second type of thing they may be realised,

00:22:23.612 --> 00:22:26.891
they may not be realised.

00:22:27.091 --> 00:22:30.953
Now when we go to Sahaj Yoga,

00:22:31.153 --> 00:22:36.692
even a person who is not a genius,
who has never been a genius,

00:22:36.892 --> 00:22:45.350
who had no idea of any special expression in life,

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:50.568
can get Realisation and of the highest type.

00:22:50.768 --> 00:22:53.178
Maybe much more than a genius,

00:22:53.379 --> 00:22:56.588
because genius might have become a geni-ass by now!

00:22:56.788 --> 00:22:59.428
His ego must have bloated out, he might be a geni-ass

00:22:59.629 --> 00:23:03.499
instead of a genius!

00:23:06.897 --> 00:23:13.565
But a Sahaj Yogi, when he gets his Realisation,

00:23:13.765 --> 00:23:19.816
his Realisation is a sign,

00:23:20.016 --> 00:23:24.732
not of his subtleties,

00:23:24.932 --> 00:23:31.292
but of his Kundalini – in what condition She is.

00:23:32.761 --> 00:23:40.742
If the Kundalini is absolutely frozen

00:23:40.942 --> 00:23:49.184
that means a person has no desire to have Realisation,

00:23:49.384 --> 00:23:53.660
he’s coming to Sahaj Yog to make some money out of it

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:56.045
or to make some name out of it,

00:23:56.245 --> 00:24:03.155
or to be - he could be a burglar coming as a Sahaj Yogi

00:24:03.355 --> 00:24:07.855
to burgle away, say, my shoes!

00:24:10.144 --> 00:24:18.504
Such a person can be very difficult for Realisation.

00:24:18.704 --> 00:24:22.122
But maybe with some people,

00:24:22.322 --> 00:24:28.201
who have some basic problems also,

00:24:28.401 --> 00:24:33.284
can have their Kundalini completely frozen out.

00:24:36.836 --> 00:24:42.090
But people of very ordinary appearances,

00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:48.412
of very ordinary life,

00:24:48.612 --> 00:24:54.019
could be very subtle,

00:24:54.219 --> 00:24:57.219
much more than all these genius

00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:00.816
and geni-asses and geniuses put together –

00:25:01.016 --> 00:25:06.142
because they can feel their Self.

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:10.095
Such people do not cheat themselves or others –

00:25:10.296 --> 00:25:13.110
no question.

00:25:13.908 --> 00:25:20.859
Their whole attitude towards Sahaj Yog

00:25:21.059 --> 00:25:30.849
is like a person who is dying and gasping for air.

00:25:31.049 --> 00:25:35.408
They are just struggling to get the Truth.

00:25:36.166 --> 00:25:41.397
They have no other interest in life, but to get to the Truth.

00:25:41.597 --> 00:25:44.601
Such people could be very strong headed,

00:25:44.801 --> 00:25:47.507
could be very different from normal.

00:25:47.707 --> 00:25:51.421
They may think many things [to be] stupid. Even just to have a wife

00:25:51.621 --> 00:25:56.520
and children and family is quite stupid isn’t it?

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.589
That’s not the end of life.

00:26:01.789 --> 00:26:04.253
It’s quite a stupid thing to do.

00:26:04.453 --> 00:26:10.310
I don’t say that you give up that, but it’s not the end of life.

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:14.607
It’s all right, it’s a part of it,

00:26:14.807 --> 00:26:17.104
[but] you are not to be lost in it.

00:26:17.304 --> 00:26:21.143
We believe that marriage is important and we believe that,

00:26:21.343 --> 00:26:25.331
in the marriage, husband, wife should be very much

00:26:25.531 --> 00:26:27.992
understanding each other.

00:26:28.192 --> 00:26:30.442
There should be love between the two.

00:26:30.643 --> 00:26:32.643
There should be enjoyment,

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:36.855
so that the children also feel the security of the family,

00:26:37.055 --> 00:26:40.394
so the society improves.

00:26:40.594 --> 00:26:44.394
All this is all right, but that’s not the end of it.

00:26:44.594 --> 00:26:47.985
In India you will find many families like that:

00:26:48.185 --> 00:26:51.376
where a husband, wife are carrying on nicely,

00:26:51.576 --> 00:26:54.415
children are nice, their money is in the bank;

00:26:54.615 --> 00:26:56.969
when they die, the money goes to the children;

00:26:57.169 --> 00:27:01.282
then the children are married nicely, then they have their children,

00:27:01.482 --> 00:27:03.505
money goes to the bank;

00:27:03.706 --> 00:27:07.014
when they die, the money goes to them.

00:27:07.214 --> 00:27:10.748
It goes on day in and day out.

00:27:10.948 --> 00:27:13.295
[It’s] nothing, it’s so mundane.

00:27:13.495 --> 00:27:15.729
That doesn’t mean I believe in divorces.

00:27:15.956 --> 00:27:19.709
Of course, that’s something nonsensical.

00:27:19.909 --> 00:27:23.479
But to be married means just you have entered into life.

00:27:23.679 --> 00:27:27.026
At least you should enter into life!

00:27:27.226 --> 00:27:31.523
That is important as far as entering is concerned.

00:27:31.724 --> 00:27:39.325
Basisc. But that is just the basic, that’s not the end of life!

00:27:40.567 --> 00:27:44.828
If you are a subtler person you will not think

00:27:45.028 --> 00:27:49.380
what is your advantage monetarily, or what you are doing,

00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:52.318
what is the thing, what gain you have got.

00:27:52.518 --> 00:27:56.638
Of course you will see that as yoga is established,

00:27:56.838 --> 00:28:01.451
your kshema will be established, your well-being will be established.

00:28:01.651 --> 00:28:07.504
You will see that, clearly. It is to be seen,

00:28:07.704 --> 00:28:11.269
to be thankful.

00:28:11.469 --> 00:28:15.262
And the kshema is all right,

00:28:15.462 --> 00:28:24.185
because you should not have worry akshema,

00:28:24.385 --> 00:28:29.974
but you should have free time to devote yourself

00:28:30.174 --> 00:28:34.169
to meditation and to Sahaj Yog:

00:28:34.369 --> 00:28:38.513
so that you don’t have too much worry.

00:28:38.713 --> 00:28:40.935
That’s how the kshema comes in.

00:28:41.135 --> 00:28:44.943
But when the kshema comes in also, one may start

00:28:45.143 --> 00:28:49.672
going into the same circle of greediness,

00:28:49.872 --> 00:28:53.907
[of] having more and more money, more and more this,

00:28:54.107 --> 00:28:58.556
better clothes, better house, [of] how to get this:

00:28:58.756 --> 00:29:02.772
this circle may start.

00:29:03.592 --> 00:29:07.345
There’s no end to it,

00:29:07.545 --> 00:29:11.992
so you have to cut it down. I am not saying

00:29:12.192 --> 00:29:16.289
that you just have one dress

00:29:16.489 --> 00:29:20.600
and all your life you end up with one dress;

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:23.327
it doesn’t mean that. Because you know if I say anything,

00:29:23.527 --> 00:29:25.159
people will shoot off to the other end.

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:28.202
I am trying to keep it in the centre

00:29:28.402 --> 00:29:31.585
[so] that not too much attention will be required on one side

00:29:31.785 --> 00:29:37.379
or on the other; of indulgences or of asceticism – none of these.

00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:43.021
You are not to renounce anything or neither
you have to indulge into anything:

00:29:43.221 --> 00:29:49.016
but feel your subtleties, feed them, nourish them,

00:29:49.216 --> 00:29:55.435
look after them. You should be proud of your subtleties:

00:29:56.849 --> 00:30:01.172
that you have these subtler values, while others don’t have,

00:30:01.372 --> 00:30:05.046
and that itself will be so self-sustaining

00:30:05.247 --> 00:30:09.520
that you can withhold all those values

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:15.363
that you get from your subtleties against the whole world.

00:30:15.563 --> 00:30:19.483
Because the world is so fragmented,

00:30:19.683 --> 00:30:24.979
so cut off, that everybody feels lonely.

00:30:25.736 --> 00:30:28.984
But that does not, by any chance, mean you should be arrogant

00:30:29.184 --> 00:30:34.570
to others, you should be fighting with others – no!

00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:38.920
But in darkness a light shines.

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:43.389
The whole is darkness. If the light accepts the darkness,

00:30:43.589 --> 00:30:46.881
then it becomes darkness! So the light must accept that:

00:30:47.081 --> 00:30:53.863
“I am the light, and I am the path,” and should stand up.

00:30:55.558 --> 00:30:59.781
That does not in any way mean any arrogance to others,

00:30:59.981 --> 00:31:04.226
any showing-off to others, but it is the Light.

00:31:04.426 --> 00:31:10.076
And the Light, by itself, emits.

00:31:13.302 --> 00:31:19.669
When this happens to you,

00:31:19.869 --> 00:31:25.107
you will not hate yourself first of all,

00:31:25.307 --> 00:31:29.266
but you will love and respect yourself

00:31:29.466 --> 00:31:36.281
and respect the virtues in you and not your grossness.

00:31:36.481 --> 00:31:41.003
Kundalini Itself makes you subtler and subtler.

00:31:41.203 --> 00:31:47.016
But if you are a stone what can Kundalini do?

00:31:50.799 --> 00:31:56.756
Now it is for you to see where you are stone.

00:31:56.956 --> 00:32:01.596
There should be a lot of heart searching.

00:32:02.596 --> 00:32:09.794
The greatest stone-age is nowadays.

00:32:09.994 --> 00:32:13.723
Heart is like a stone!

00:32:13.923 --> 00:32:16.981
It doesn’t move.

00:32:17.181 --> 00:32:20.052
When talking to others,

00:32:20.253 --> 00:32:22.794
it doesn’t move.

00:32:23.013 --> 00:32:25.977
It has no ripple in it, there’s no joy in it.

00:32:26.177 --> 00:32:30.456
It’s like a stone sitting there to hit everyone.

00:32:30.656 --> 00:32:32.656
You see anybody sees you, “Oh Bala! He’s coming!

00:32:32.857 --> 00:32:34.857
Go from the other road!” “Who?”

00:32:35.058 --> 00:32:39.078
“That fellow with the stone heart!”

00:32:40.811 --> 00:32:43.498
And you feel you are all right, you are a very good person

00:32:43.699 --> 00:32:45.699
because you are stone hearted.

00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:49.260
You think you can dominate the whole world because you are stone hearted,

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:52.762
you can give psychological treatments to others, keep quiet,

00:32:52.962 --> 00:32:56.262
don’t talk to anyone, shout at others and do whatever you please,

00:32:56.462 --> 00:32:59.908
because you have a stone heart.

00:33:00.551 --> 00:33:03.718
Nothing happens to your stone there.

00:33:03.918 --> 00:33:07.868
Now this stone heartedness

00:33:08.068 --> 00:33:16.058
is the sign that you should not be any more in Sahaj Yog.

00:33:17.926 --> 00:33:23.639
You must have a heart as your Mother has:

00:33:23.839 --> 00:33:26.819
pulsating with love,

00:33:27.019 --> 00:33:31.232
with compassion, with joy,

00:33:31.432 --> 00:33:35.661
with happiness, with giving.

00:33:35.861 --> 00:33:40.858
That should be the attitude,

00:33:41.058 --> 00:33:44.124
not rationality, nothing.

00:33:44.324 --> 00:33:48.593
It is the feeling:

00:33:48.793 --> 00:33:51.967
feeling for the pains of others,

00:33:52.167 --> 00:33:58.811
feeling for their longings and feeling for their aspirations.

00:33:59.011 --> 00:34:05.405
Just feeling them within yourself

00:34:05.605 --> 00:34:19.484
is their desire to be the Whole,

00:34:19.684 --> 00:34:26.359
to be the Ocean Itself,

00:34:26.559 --> 00:34:30.909
itself is so fulfilling.

00:34:32.349 --> 00:34:37.724
We should not have our ideals among ourselves.

00:34:38.112 --> 00:34:40.156
Like, “She does this so why should I do?”

00:34:40.357 --> 00:34:44.795
“He does this so why should I do?” It’s very mediocre.

00:34:44.995 --> 00:34:50.400
It’s a very low-grade business to see others,

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:54.088
to worry about others, to talk about others.

00:34:54.288 --> 00:34:58.985
It’s extremely low grade.

00:34:59.781 --> 00:35:06.621
A person who is of a calibre

00:35:06.821 --> 00:35:09.613
has his standards so much higher

00:35:09.813 --> 00:35:16.313
that he cannot compare himself with others.

00:35:17.617 --> 00:35:22.448
It’s really true. So, if I start comparing myself with you,

00:35:22.648 --> 00:35:26.120
what will be my position?

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:31.132
I mean, I can’t do it!

00:35:32.196 --> 00:35:34.655
Then you will say, “It’s all right for you Mother!” It’s perfect,

00:35:34.855 --> 00:35:37.691
I agree, it’s all right for me as I am.

00:35:37.891 --> 00:35:42.726
But you can be like me also.

00:35:48.054 --> 00:35:56.643
But if I start comparing and thinking, “Oh God, what is this?”

00:35:56.843 --> 00:36:00.087
then I should give up doing anything, thinking,

00:36:00.287 --> 00:36:04.585
“Where have I come?”

00:36:05.272 --> 00:36:08.682
But when you know that

00:36:08.882 --> 00:36:13.897
you are not comparing, you are just giving.

00:36:14.773 --> 00:36:20.409
The question of comparison should not arise at all,

00:36:20.609 --> 00:36:22.971
at all.

00:36:23.171 --> 00:36:26.259
It’s just feeling.

00:36:26.459 --> 00:36:29.618
I just feel.

00:36:29.818 --> 00:36:34.255
In the same way you feel each other.

00:36:37.717 --> 00:36:40.845
Not in an artificial, courteous way:

00:36:41.045 --> 00:36:43.126
[like] some people think that

00:36:43.326 --> 00:36:45.409
if they have given their seat to someone

00:36:45.609 --> 00:36:48.550
they have been really the generous people,

00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:53.242
the greatest generous people!

00:36:55.787 --> 00:36:59.369
Just be yourself now: let’s see.

00:36:59.569 --> 00:37:03.986
Just be yourself, and that you are the Light.

00:37:04.186 --> 00:37:08.424
What is the comparison?

00:37:17.212 --> 00:37:23.697
The comparison exists when our calibre is low.

00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:30.423
If it is 24 carat gold, what is the comparison?

00:37:30.623 --> 00:37:32.759
It’s absolute.

00:37:32.959 --> 00:37:37.215
If you are at an absolute point, there’s no comparison.

00:37:37.415 --> 00:37:42.598
So try to see that your calibre is that,

00:37:42.798 --> 00:37:46.471
that you are of that calibre

00:37:46.671 --> 00:37:49.425
and don’t worry about gross people.

00:37:49.625 --> 00:37:51.608
Gross are gross [and] will remain gross:

00:37:51.824 --> 00:37:57.025
you just don’t worry about them. You [should] keep your calibre all right.

00:37:57.541 --> 00:38:03.463
And that is what is the most essential part of Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:04.127 --> 00:38:07.789
Thank you very much.

00:38:11.494 --> 00:38:12.493
- Huh?

00:38:12.694 --> 00:38:15.032
They always tell me that You are actually God ,

00:38:15.233 --> 00:38:19.217
the Father God Himself.

00:38:19.418 --> 00:38:21.283
Well I can’t see that at all.

00:38:21.483 --> 00:38:25.944
All right, now put your hand towards me. Ask the question.

00:38:27.124 --> 00:38:29.124
The simplest computer.

00:38:29.325 --> 00:38:33.812
Work out your computer and ask the question, finished.

00:38:36.874 --> 00:38:41.197
That, “She is the ‘E’, means She is the One

00:38:41.397 --> 00:38:47.083
who is the desire of God Almighty.  the meaning?

00:38:47.841 --> 00:38:52.789
She is the power of God,

00:38:52.989 --> 00:38:56.016
and it is only She who incarnates.”

00:38:56.216 --> 00:39:03.743
If you read the Vedas, it is said that She created Her child,

00:39:03.943 --> 00:39:14.974
and the first sound that was created was the child.

00:39:16.092 --> 00:39:24.709
And that sound is the sound what we call as Brahma,

00:39:24.909 --> 00:39:29.248
or the Logos, as they call it.

00:39:36.615 --> 00:39:41.615
So now, what is the difference between God and God’s desire?

00:39:41.815 --> 00:39:46.425
What is the difference between sun and sunlight?

00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:54.068
What is the difference between moon and moonlight?

00:39:54.268 --> 00:39:59.343
What is the difference between the word and the meaning?

00:40:09.957 --> 00:40:16.905
So the God Almighty whom people understand,

00:40:17.105 --> 00:40:21.138
is just a witness.

00:40:21.338 --> 00:40:27.307
The day these two things will meet, there won’t be any world left.

00:40:29.943 --> 00:40:34.141
Till they are separated, all these things happened.

00:40:34.341 --> 00:40:40.084
When they meet, and merge into each other, there’s nothing left,

00:40:40.284 --> 00:40:45.519
He just becomes the sound, Brahma.

00:40:56.049 --> 00:40:59.294
We cannot understand these things, because we have never seen

00:40:59.494 --> 00:41:04.284
two things [which are] that merged together as God and His Power.

00:41:04.484 --> 00:41:07.823
We cannot understand

00:41:08.023 --> 00:41:14.068
anything like that because there is no parallel.

00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:22.358
Now, you can rationally also see things, that:

00:41:22.558 --> 00:41:25.132
people, when they bend before me,

00:41:25.333 --> 00:41:28.441
their Kundalini starts moving.

00:41:28.642 --> 00:41:30.876
It is written in the scriptures [that]

00:41:31.077 --> 00:41:35.080
only at the feet of Adi Shakti this would happen.

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:38.952
Not only that, but you people

00:41:39.153 --> 00:41:43.307
who have not been to any austere life or anything,

00:41:43.507 --> 00:41:45.745
have got Realisation

00:41:45.956 --> 00:41:51.717
and that your own power is giving them Realisation. Isn’t it?

00:41:51.917 --> 00:41:58.740
There is no one in the whole world today [

00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:01.489
even though] there may be some realised-souls,

00:42:01.689 --> 00:42:05.543
who can give, the way you give, Realisation.

00:42:05.743 --> 00:42:09.864
You go and talk to some great gurus:

00:42:10.064 --> 00:42:12.742
they are jealous of you.

00:42:12.942 --> 00:42:17.914
They know who I am, they have told people who I am,

00:42:18.114 --> 00:42:21.140
but they are jealous.

00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:24.340
They don’t understand why of all the things

00:42:24.541 --> 00:42:26.541
I have given you these powers while they don’t have.

00:42:26.742 --> 00:42:28.742
They can’t give Realisation the way you give,

00:42:28.943 --> 00:42:31.842
in a second like this; nobody can.

00:42:32.042 --> 00:42:34.528
You can go and have a look at them.

00:42:34.729 --> 00:42:38.529
They are great people no doubt.

00:42:38.729 --> 00:42:43.003
But your Kundalini works like a jet.

00:42:43.203 --> 00:42:48.909
They move like elephants,

00:42:49.109 --> 00:42:51.666
from one chakra to another chakra.

00:42:51.866 --> 00:42:54.866
The Kundalini doesn’t move that way as it moves [in you],

00:42:55.067 --> 00:42:59.499
because I have given you the authority.

00:43:02.255 --> 00:43:07.211
You can go and meet them and they will tell you.

00:43:07.411 --> 00:43:11.204
There are thousands of people they have got [as] disciples,

00:43:11.404 --> 00:43:13.509
but they don’t send them to me.

00:43:13.710 --> 00:43:15.710
They said, “Mother You will find your calibre [of people].

00:43:15.911 --> 00:43:18.630
These gross people, you leave it to us.

00:43:18.830 --> 00:43:20.845
We’ll manage them. We’ll send them later on.

00:43:21.046 --> 00:43:23.975
Just now you find your subtle people.”

00:43:24.175 --> 00:43:26.815
Why Sahaja Yogis are few [is] because there are

00:43:27.016 --> 00:43:29.694
very few subtle people in this world of that calibre.

00:43:29.894 --> 00:43:32.509
That’s why I am always requesting you that:

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:35.419
do not divert your attention here and there.

00:43:35.619 --> 00:43:38.619
Settle down. Become good Sahaja Yogis. Unless and until

00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:41.419
you really become good Sahaja Yogis

00:43:41.619 --> 00:43:45.973
I cannot move to the second strata.

00:43:46.528 --> 00:43:48.653
Because the first strata is not yet settled down.

00:43:48.854 --> 00:43:51.125
They are worried about nonsensical things.

00:43:51.325 --> 00:43:56.641
I mean I just, sometimes, feel very unhappy to see that

00:43:56.841 --> 00:44:03.141
you fight among yourselves. This is something so painful,

00:44:03.341 --> 00:44:05.291
that you say harsh words to each other.

00:44:05.492 --> 00:44:11.089
I mean you are the cream for me.

00:44:14.401 --> 00:44:17.131
You go and ask any one of the gurus,

00:44:17.332 --> 00:44:23.936
if they can move the Kundalini on their fingers as you do!

00:44:26.862 --> 00:44:31.919
These powers cannot be given by an ordinary person.

00:44:32.119 --> 00:44:36.896
I look ordinary, no doubt; I have to.

00:44:37.096 --> 00:44:42.064
But also you have seen me in other forms;

00:44:42.264 --> 00:44:45.264
that’s not important.

00:44:45.506 --> 00:44:48.009
The important thing is [that] you should see your own transformation

00:44:48.209 --> 00:44:52.140
and how many powers are manifesting.

00:44:52.567 --> 00:44:54.530
If you go and tell somebody that,

00:44:54.731 --> 00:44:57.542
“I have started giving Realisation and raising Kundalini.”

00:44:57.742 --> 00:45:02.257
They will say, “You are mad! How can it be? Impossible!”

00:45:02.457 --> 00:45:04.425
Nobody is going to believe you at all.

00:45:04.626 --> 00:45:07.173
You have got it so easily:

00:45:07.374 --> 00:45:12.454
why? Because I recognise certain subtleties in you.

00:45:16.754 --> 00:45:19.457
These gurus recognise me. They know about me.

00:45:19.658 --> 00:45:21.937
They know who I am. They are telling others.

00:45:22.137 --> 00:45:25.911
There are so many of them like that.

00:45:26.216 --> 00:45:29.195
I told you the story of the lady here, American lady.

00:45:29.395 --> 00:45:32.453
She might come sometimes. I think you met her isn’t it?

00:45:32.653 --> 00:45:36.437
Some of you have met her. She went to Rangoon

00:45:36.637 --> 00:45:41.421
and there she went to meet some very great, high soul

00:45:41.621 --> 00:45:45.230
who was living on a mountain and he would not meet many people.

00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:49.628
But she went there and he really respected her.

00:45:49.828 --> 00:45:51.906
And when she came in he said,

00:45:52.107 --> 00:45:56.566
“I am going to sit at a lower level than yours.”

00:45:56.766 --> 00:45:59.766
So she could not understand. He said,

00:45:59.967 --> 00:46:03.201
“Because you have seen Mother with your own eyes. I haven’t.

00:46:03.401 --> 00:46:08.393
I will have to die to come and see Her again.”

00:46:10.921 --> 00:46:14.788
And then she was surprised.

00:46:17.187 --> 00:46:21.065
But first of all know that you have got these powers within you.

00:46:21.265 --> 00:46:24.265
Then know that you have got them

00:46:24.531 --> 00:46:29.172
because I have chosen you.

00:46:34.214 --> 00:46:37.490
All right? Good!

00:46:37.690 --> 00:46:40.300
See now!

00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:45.309
Only thing: you get rid of your egos, which give you ideas.

00:46:45.509 --> 00:46:48.372
You see sometimes they come like big balloons!

00:46:48.572 --> 00:46:53.713
So tell yourself, “Oh mister ego, please get out!

00:46:54.129 --> 00:47:01.866
These powers I have got because Mother has chosen me,

00:47:02.066 --> 00:47:07.943
has loved me, has nourished me

00:47:08.144 --> 00:47:13.775
and has accepted me as Her child.”

00:47:14.572 --> 00:47:17.583
It’s a fact!

00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:21.204
Nobody can believe that you can give Realisation I tell you.

00:47:21.404 --> 00:47:24.352
You go and tell anybody.

00:47:24.552 --> 00:47:31.004
You should! But they are not going to believe you.

00:47:35.574 --> 00:47:39.466
If this flowers says that, “I can become

00:47:39.666 --> 00:47:43.099
the lamp in the lighthouse.”

00:47:43.299 --> 00:47:47.425
Nobody’s going to believe it,

00:47:47.625 --> 00:47:51.003
because the light in the lighthouse is made in a special factory

00:47:51.203 --> 00:47:53.800
with a special this, and a special that.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:58.550
But supposing this flower says so, or if this flower says that,

00:47:58.750 --> 00:48:03.401
“I can cure your diseases.”

00:48:03.601 --> 00:48:08.547
Nobody would believe; but it may.

00:48:11.586 --> 00:48:16.659
When something fantastic happens

00:48:16.859 --> 00:48:20.781
you have to believe that there is Divine acting

00:48:20.981 --> 00:48:25.661
and acting so dynamically.

00:48:34.063 --> 00:48:39.129
Only thing [is]: do not waste your energies in gross hankerings

00:48:39.329 --> 00:48:44.225
and gross wanderings and ramblings.

00:48:44.897 --> 00:48:48.916
Try to be subtler and subtler.

00:48:49.116 --> 00:48:54.365
There is nothing that I have to ask for.

00:48:54.565 --> 00:48:59.037
Now you think about it from God’s point of view.

00:48:59.237 --> 00:49:01.622
You are to be given Realisation: first job.

00:49:01.822 --> 00:49:06.585
It’s a headache you know!

00:49:07.319 --> 00:49:10.346
Somebody has to take up the headache of giving Realisation.

00:49:10.546 --> 00:49:13.956
It is much easier to be crucified once,

00:49:14.156 --> 00:49:18.402
but to be giving Realisation hundred times,

00:49:18.602 --> 00:49:24.219
to all kinds of funny Kundalinis to be raised,

00:49:24.419 --> 00:49:27.255
you cannot imagine!

00:49:27.456 --> 00:49:32.017
And then after giving Realisation to tell you all about it:

00:49:32.217 --> 00:49:35.217
to decode all the chakras, to show you all the chakras,

00:49:35.418 --> 00:49:39.546
to tell you all about Deities, these archetypes and everything.

00:49:39.746 --> 00:49:46.108
And every word of it is true and acts and works.

00:49:46.308 --> 00:49:50.436
You have experimented and found out.

00:49:50.636 --> 00:49:54.927
Somebody has to come down.

00:49:55.896 --> 00:50:02.344
It has been my lot to come.

00:50:02.544 --> 00:50:05.255
I don’t mind, as I told the other day,

00:50:05.455 --> 00:50:07.927
any one of you takes my seat I’ll be very happy

00:50:08.127 --> 00:50:12.927
to be a Sahaja Yogi sitting down like that!

00:50:13.127 --> 00:50:17.701
Really, I tell you! I will be the happiest person.

00:50:17.901 --> 00:50:22.240
I’ll give you five garlands like this

00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:26.868
and all the flowers from the market I will bring for you,

00:50:27.068 --> 00:50:34.005
if you could sit here and do the job for me.

00:50:34.614 --> 00:50:39.868
It’s very easy to doubt, but can you do the job?

00:50:40.068 --> 00:50:42.727
No, you cannot.

00:50:42.927 --> 00:50:46.716
This is the trouble with the Western mind is,

00:50:46.916 --> 00:50:49.857
that it doubts.

00:50:50.057 --> 00:50:52.997
What are you doubting about?

00:50:53.197 --> 00:50:57.316
What is there to doubt?

00:50:58.144 --> 00:51:03.131
I cannot doubt myself, that’s very difficult.

00:51:03.331 --> 00:51:08.026
When you know that this is the tea, how can you doubt?

00:51:08.226 --> 00:51:13.616
Now if you doubt, what can I do? How to prove it?

00:51:17.799 --> 00:51:24.252
Best way is to understand my love.

00:51:25.463 --> 00:51:29.103
Through that you will understand me better.

00:51:29.303 --> 00:51:34.502
It’s much easier to understand me through your heart

00:51:34.702 --> 00:51:41.786
than through your brains, because I am very good at blasting them;

00:51:41.986 --> 00:51:44.560
and I play about with you, lots of things,

00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:51.421
by which I really give you a very difficult time.

00:51:51.621 --> 00:51:54.913
Because if you start thinking, I make you think more.

00:51:55.113 --> 00:51:58.803
If you start doubting, I make you doubt more.

00:51:59.003 --> 00:52:04.171
So best thing is to see. As I told the other day that,

00:52:04.371 --> 00:52:06.851
whatever is in the next room, it’s better to go and see

00:52:07.051 --> 00:52:11.687
than to sit down here and doubt,

00:52:11.887 --> 00:52:16.467
or to accept it and sit down here. No! Go and see for yourself.

00:52:16.667 --> 00:52:18.667
And you have seen it yourself.

00:52:18.868 --> 00:52:22.467
But just think how tremendous it is.

00:52:22.667 --> 00:52:26.047
Just sit down and think,

00:52:26.247 --> 00:52:30.250
how great it is, how dynamic it is!

00:52:30.450 --> 00:52:35.349
That you have seen it with your own eyes!

00:52:35.896 --> 00:52:40.115
Just think,

00:52:43.506 --> 00:52:50.026
that you have felt it. That you are the people who have got it.

00:52:50.226 --> 00:52:54.637
You are the first few who have known it.

00:52:54.837 --> 00:52:57.704
There may be thousands and thousands later

00:52:57.905 --> 00:53:01.723
and the whole universe may take it up, but you are the first few.

00:53:01.923 --> 00:53:04.114
Improve your calibre.

00:53:04.314 --> 00:53:07.454
Come up!

00:53:18.429 --> 00:53:20.675
I think if you can give me leave, I would like to go

00:53:20.875 --> 00:53:24.393
because the whole day I have been really working very hard.

00:53:24.593 --> 00:53:28.908
I did my cooking and did that. Now, what’s the matter with you?

00:53:29.109 --> 00:53:33.675
You, still more? Still more?

00:53:33.875 --> 00:53:41.500
Better! Keep like that! All right. Now can I take your leave?
