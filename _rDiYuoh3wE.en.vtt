02:06.995 --> 02:13.315
I congratulate all the Sahaja Yogis of Melbourne

02:14.595 --> 02:17.915
for doing such a wonderful job of this ashram

02:19.795 --> 02:22.915
and working it out with such dedication.

02:24.795 --> 02:30.595
Dedication is a very great rewarding effort.

02:32.115 --> 02:35.315
Nothing can be more rewarding than dedication,

02:36.515 --> 02:43.457
it's so joy giving and peace giving and satisfying

02:47.315 --> 02:51.603
effort or work you can call it.

02:53.195 --> 02:54.995
When it comes from the heart,

02:55.595 --> 02:56.795
with love,

02:57.795 --> 02:59.395
when you try to do something,

03:00.995 --> 03:02.915
it works out beautifully

03:07.315 --> 03:09.915
and it shows its aesthetics,

03:11.195 --> 03:15.915
expresses, and anyone

03:16.195 --> 03:20.595
who sees that can see that it is done out of dedication.

03:22.195 --> 03:26.315
Example of dedication is Ajanta and Ellora Caves are.

03:27.395 --> 03:30.315
These were the people who were worshippers of Buddha.

03:30.915 --> 03:33.395
Of course they were not realized souls as you are.

03:34.395 --> 03:36.515
They were just worshippers of Buddha

03:37.195 --> 03:40.515
and they wanted to have their moksha, nirvana,

03:40.795 --> 03:41.995
of what you have got already.

03:43.315 --> 03:47.915
But they worked in that cave with such attention

03:48.235 --> 03:52.715
and such love that even when they were not in Yoga,

03:53.435 --> 03:55.635
when they were not in union with God,

03:56.435 --> 03:58.435
they were so much blessed

03:58.715 --> 04:03.315
that in that dark caves where we cannot see with our

04:04.635 --> 04:05.515
normal eyes,

04:05.835 --> 04:12.315
we can't even see those things with ordinary lights,

04:12.635 --> 04:14.835
you have to use very strong lights

04:15.115 --> 04:19.315
to see that - in those days it worked out,

04:19.915 --> 04:21.515
in those dark caves,

04:22.635 --> 04:28.635
such beautiful murals,

04:28.915 --> 04:34.715
paintings, reliefs, statues, every sort of thing,

04:35.915 --> 04:38.315
that it is surprising how they could do it.

04:38.515 --> 04:41.515
When we walk in, we have to use very strong lights

04:41.835 --> 04:44.235
and because of these strong lights,

04:44.915 --> 04:46.315
that is fading now.

04:48.235 --> 04:50.435
But we can see the dedication

04:51.715 --> 04:53.915
that they had to God.

04:55.315 --> 04:58.035
They did not believe in God, but to Lord Buddha

04:59.115 --> 05:03.115
so that they can get their moksha, their Self-realization.

05:03.955 --> 05:07.635
Maybe, so many of them are born again today

05:08.435 --> 05:09.635
to get their realization

05:10.635 --> 05:13.555
and they might be some of the Sahaja yogis

05:14.555 --> 05:16.635
that we are meeting them in Maharashtra,

05:17.355 --> 05:19.435
those who worked for Lord Buddha

05:20.155 --> 05:23.555
to express their love and dedication.

05:27.355 --> 05:31.355
So dedication takes away all the

05:36.035 --> 05:42.155
wastage interest like

05:43.635 --> 05:46.235
how much money we are going to get,

05:48.355 --> 05:52.235
what is our certificate,

05:53.435 --> 05:58.235
whether it's going to be used in the world wide range or not.

05:58.555 --> 06:00.035
All these things are finished.

06:00.435 --> 06:02.955
You just do it for doing's sake.

06:03.555 --> 06:05.835
And you don't feel at all, at all,

06:07.435 --> 06:11.755
any pinch or any,

06:17.555 --> 06:20.755
what you can call the screwing up of your energies

06:21.035 --> 06:22.555
but you just float.

06:23.555 --> 06:25.155
This is what dedication is,

06:26.755 --> 06:29.355
and this dedication comes

06:29.635 --> 06:34.555
when you realize that you are a Spirit.

06:36.875 --> 06:40.555
It's much better because that is the place

06:40.875 --> 06:43.275
where Shri Krishna has said, ananya bhakti,

06:44.155 --> 06:47.075
when there is not the other, you and your God,

06:47.355 --> 06:50.075
in between there is nobody else ananya.

06:50.675 --> 06:54.155
Nobody else. You and your God are one

06:54.475 --> 06:57.875
and that is the best time when the dedication works.

06:59.475 --> 07:00.955
That is the bhakti,

07:01.155 --> 07:04.075
that's what He said that,  "If you give Me flower,

07:04.955 --> 07:07.275
if you give Me water,

07:08.155 --> 07:09.875
or if you give Me leaves,

07:10.155 --> 07:11.475
I accept everything."

07:11.955 --> 07:14.155
But when it comes to His giving,

07:14.475 --> 07:17.075
He said we should get ananya bhakti

07:17.355 --> 07:18.755
This is the blessing of God.

07:21.075 --> 07:25.875
There's one of the sayings about the Goddess is

07:26.155 --> 07:30.875
that, Ya Devi Sarva bhuteshu, bhakti rupena samsthitah

07:31.475 --> 07:33.675
- "The one who gives us that dedication,

07:33.955 --> 07:35.355
that sense of dedication,

07:37.355 --> 07:39.755
You are the one who resides in everyone

07:40.075 --> 07:41.875
with that sense of dedicating."

07:43.395 --> 07:46.875
And it is such a joy that cannot be expressed

07:47.795 --> 07:51.395
what this is, that one you feel

07:51.675 --> 07:52.795
when you are dedicated.

07:53.395 --> 07:56.595
This morning, you all got up, all ready,

07:57.275 --> 08:00.475
all the children are happily dressed, everything was done.

08:00.795 --> 08:05.275
I saw everyone busy getting everything ready

08:05.595 --> 08:08.475
and working it out so beautifully.

08:09.795 --> 08:15.475
It's something so loving

08:16.275 --> 08:18.675
as if the Mother Earth gives flowers

08:19.395 --> 08:21.075
for the worship of your Mother.

08:22.075 --> 08:25.595
You yourself in your dedication look like flowers,

08:25.875 --> 08:27.395
yourself like lotuses.

08:28.075 --> 08:33.955
It's so great to see this work being done,

08:34.275 --> 08:38.875
with such attention, with such care, with such love.

08:40.275 --> 08:43.875
Melbourne I think is a word called from mala born,

08:44.195 --> 08:45.875
we can say born out of mala

08:46.195 --> 08:48.275
and that is the name of the lotus,

08:49.195 --> 08:53.875
that it is born out of the dirt and the filth.

08:54.395 --> 08:56.475
Mala is the dirt or impurity.

08:56.795 --> 08:59.395
So this beautiful thing has come out of that

08:59.595 --> 09:01.075
and you can see that this place

09:01.395 --> 09:05.315
was inhabited by people who were really in a mess.

09:05.715 --> 09:07.115
And out of that mess

09:07.315 --> 09:10.395
you have created such a beautiful thing like this ashram.

09:10.715 --> 09:16.195
And is so much one with the name of Melbourne

09:16.515 --> 09:18.515
that this is a place is created

09:19.315 --> 09:25.195
by you people like a lotus comes out of the pond

09:25.515 --> 09:27.315
which is full of dirt and filth

09:27.595 --> 09:31.515
and then this lotus fills the whole atmosphere

09:31.795 --> 09:36.115
with such fragrance that everyone forgets about the mala.

09:36.395 --> 09:41.395
They just think of the Nirmala which is this flower,

09:41.715 --> 09:44.915
and this is what I felt about your ashram,

09:45.115 --> 09:46.995
the way you have done it with understanding,

09:47.315 --> 09:49.795
it's so good with such a lot of beautiful things

09:50.995 --> 09:55.515
and admirable it is really, to see how your dedication has done.

09:55.715 --> 09:56.595
Warren: There's a lotus for you there, Mother.

09:56.915 --> 09:59.915
I've seen that in the morning also. Beautiful.

10:07.115 --> 10:09.395
I told her that it will have fragrance.

10:15.595 --> 10:18.715
I can see so many lotuses sitting before Me.

10:20.515 --> 10:21.795
It's so beautiful.

10:22.115 --> 10:24.635
So this is all in dedication you see,

10:24.915 --> 10:28.435
this comes out of that mala just for the worship of God.

10:30.235 --> 10:37.315
And this K-mala, K-mala out of the mala,

10:37.635 --> 10:40.715
it is called as K-mala the name is K-mala

10:41.035 --> 10:42.115
it is called as K-mala

10:42.435 --> 10:44.835
it means  the one which is created out of mala.

10:44.915 --> 10:47.435
Same is the name of Melbourne I think,

10:47.715 --> 10:48.835
the way it is said.

10:49.115 --> 10:52.515
I don't know how this name has come Melbourne,

10:52.835 --> 10:56.235
but you can say Mel-born, can be mala born,

10:56.515 --> 10:57.835
could be K-mala like that.

10:58.635 --> 11:01.915
And it is really this place has become like that.

11:02.235 --> 11:05.115
Let anybody else come and see this and they will be amazed,

11:05.435 --> 11:08.715
how the whole thing is so beautiful,

11:09.035 --> 11:15.235
so comforting, so vibrating and so assuring.

11:17.115 --> 11:22.035
Now, we have already started doing such good work in Australia,

11:23.235 --> 11:25.315
and I'm sure you are going to get

11:25.635 --> 11:30.835
lots of people for your ashram to stay here.

11:31.115 --> 11:34.715
And also you might get lot of people also to work on them.

11:35.315 --> 11:37.235
But you have to be rather careful

11:37.555 --> 11:38.715
when you admit them here.

11:39.235 --> 11:41.755
You must see first of all how they work it out.

11:42.035 --> 11:44.635
You first work them out outside,

11:44.955 --> 11:47.955
see how their chakras are, how they are,

11:48.235 --> 11:54.955
how their behavior is, and how they are attached to things.

11:55.235 --> 11:57.155
Once you find them all right,

11:57.435 --> 12:00.955
then you can have them inside, but be careful.

12:01.235 --> 12:02.835
You'd better send Me their photographs.

12:03.155 --> 12:05.835
Let Me see for Myself if they are all right,

12:06.155 --> 12:09.835
because you might get some very good people,

12:10.155 --> 12:11.235
if you are lucky enough,

12:11.555 --> 12:13.435
you will get as you have seen some very good people

12:13.635 --> 12:14.955
have come already.

12:15.235 --> 12:19.035
Such nice, solid people. I'm so amazed to see these new people here

12:19.355 --> 12:21.435
that you can't believe that they have been in Sahaja Yoga

12:21.435 --> 12:24.755
only for such a short time and they are so good

12:25.035 --> 12:26.755
and so beautifully placed there.

12:27.035 --> 12:30.355
I hope you'll get more like this,

12:30.635 --> 12:34.355
many more like this of the same value, same quality

12:35.355 --> 12:40.955
and something good will come out of all their

12:41.555 --> 12:44.075
entry into your ashram.

12:44.675 --> 12:49.875
I bless you for getting all the best people of Melbourne

12:50.675 --> 12:55.155
to be in your contact, of very high level spirituality

12:55.475 --> 12:59.155
and seeking and purity and simplicity.

13:00.675 --> 13:03.875
I find the people in Melbourne are very simple people,

13:04.475 --> 13:07.755
are extremely simple and very expressive.

13:08.075 --> 13:10.075
The simpler you are, you are much more expressive.

13:10.355 --> 13:13.275
The more complicated you are, the worse it becomes.

13:14.155 --> 13:17.075
And for your Mother is difficult to understand

13:17.355 --> 13:18.555
something who is complicated.

13:18.875 --> 13:20.875
See, it can go round and round and round,

13:21.155 --> 13:26.675
so I like when it is a very simple expression of their love

13:27.355 --> 13:30.675
and joy that I can perceive it so clearly

13:30.875 --> 13:34.475
and it gives Me a great love

13:34.755 --> 13:39.875
like the ripples of the shores.

13:40.475 --> 13:43.675
They return back in the same way from My heart

13:43.955 --> 13:50.555
also joy is rebounding again towards you.

13:50.875 --> 13:54.155
It's a kind of a beautiful rapport

13:55.155 --> 13:57.475
where nobody gains, nobody loses,

13:57.755 --> 14:00.555
everybody elevates oneself that's all.

14:00.875 --> 14:03.155
Sort of a thing is something so different

14:03.795 --> 14:07.195
that it cannot be explained in any analogy.

14:09.475 --> 14:11.795
Dedication to Sahaja Yoga,

14:12.395 --> 14:16.075
your purity about it,

14:16.955 --> 14:19.475
without asking for any gains,

14:20.075 --> 14:21.955
asking for any advantage.

14:22.675 --> 14:26.595
Just working it out because now you are the gurus.

14:27.075 --> 14:29.675
You don't have to ask anything, you have to just give.

14:29.955 --> 14:31.595
The more you give the more you'll get.

14:31.875 --> 14:33.795
I don't mean that you have to give any money

14:33.955 --> 14:35.795
or anything but you have to give more love.

14:36.075 --> 14:39.275
The more love you give the more love you'll get

14:39.595 --> 14:42.595
and that is how it is going to work out for all of you.

14:42.875 --> 14:46.195
I'm sure a day will come

14:46.675 --> 14:50.195
when we will become extremely powerful

14:51.075 --> 14:54.875
in every place in Australia.

14:54.955 --> 14:58.875
Now we have chosen only four centers,

14:59.475 --> 15:03.795
and we have to work it out in a proper way

15:04.075 --> 15:08.475
without going into quarrels, fighting, back-biting,

15:08.675 --> 15:10.875
all these small things, and selfishness.

15:11.195 --> 15:13.475
Specially with children it happens,  "It's my child,

15:13.715 --> 15:15.115
it's my child," like that.

15:15.395 --> 15:18.995
Try to share. Try to understand others also.

15:19.195 --> 15:20.795
If you bring sweets for one child,

15:20.995 --> 15:22.195
it should be for all of them.

15:22.515 --> 15:27.115
And also with food, also, don't try to keep back anything

15:27.395 --> 15:30.795
because children will also learn these bad habits, you see.

15:31.115 --> 15:32.195
Nothing to be kept back.

15:32.515 --> 15:33.595
Tell them how to share,

15:33.915 --> 15:35.315
that's something one must learn,

15:35.595 --> 15:38.795
to teach the children that they must know how to share,

15:39.115 --> 15:41.795
how to be gentle, how to be kind,

15:42.115 --> 15:49.395
how to be adjustable and not to be fussy.

15:49.715 --> 15:52.395
If some child is fussy, try to treat the child,

15:52.715 --> 15:55.195
because it's a disease which must be got rid of.

15:55.515 --> 15:57.915
So all these petty things if you just now to look after,

15:58.395 --> 16:00.915
then you'll find your children are great

16:01.115 --> 16:02.395
because they are born realized.

16:02.715 --> 16:05.315
And it's such a blessing to have born realized children

16:05.515 --> 16:07.395
because God's attention is specially on you

16:07.715 --> 16:09.635
because they are born realized children,

16:09.915 --> 16:13.315
so you must have full idea as to what is to be done with them,

16:13.635 --> 16:14.715
how to look after them,

16:15.035 --> 16:20.235
how to give them full nourishment of spirituality.

16:20.515 --> 16:22.435
You yourself should be so good

16:22.715 --> 16:25.315
that they should see you as a foundation

16:25.635 --> 16:27.635
and they should try to follow you.

16:27.915 --> 16:30.715
It is not so much the precept of Sahaja Yoga

16:31.035 --> 16:33.035
which is important, one must know

16:33.315 --> 16:35.915
is the practice because precepts are great,

16:36.235 --> 16:37.435
you know I'm there,

16:37.635 --> 16:41.035
but the children are going to see you, not Me so much.

16:41.315 --> 16:43.235
So it's better that you also

16:43.515 --> 16:46.035
practice Sahaja Yoga in your everyday life.

16:46.315 --> 16:50.235
And one simple word one has to remember is that

16:50.515 --> 16:54.115
you love your Mother and your Mother loves you.

16:54.435 --> 16:56.435
In the same way, you must love others.

16:56.715 --> 17:01.315
But there's one thing that gives you

17:01.515 --> 17:04.515
the real idea of love, is discretion.

17:04.835 --> 17:07.435
Spoiling somebody is not love.

17:07.715 --> 17:10.235
Ruining somebody is not love.

17:10.555 --> 17:14.555
Love is that which elevates you, takes you higher.

17:14.835 --> 17:17.755
False sympathies, identifications,

17:18.035 --> 17:20.755
always spoil the lives of people.

17:21.035 --> 17:23.955
But discreet love,

17:24.235 --> 17:26.435
and love is the thing that gives you the power,

17:26.755 --> 17:29.555
love itself gives you that wisdom to be discreet.

17:30.155 --> 17:32.755
Love itself teaches you how to be discreet.

17:33.035 --> 17:35.355
In a beautiful way we have to be discreet,

17:35.635 --> 17:39.635
not to be harsh, angry, in a temper,

17:39.955 --> 17:44.435
but in a proper, artistic way you must know how discreetly

17:44.755 --> 17:48.555
you emit your spirituality to your children,

17:48.835 --> 17:51.835
to your friends, to your surroundings,

17:52.155 --> 17:55.035
to Sahaja yogis and to the whole world.

17:55.355 --> 18:01.355
But first step your attachment should be with Sahaja yogis.

18:01.635 --> 18:05.355
Never try to find faults with Sahaja yogis as far as possible.

18:05.635 --> 18:07.835
But if one person becomes too much,

18:08.155 --> 18:09.755
then all of you should oppose him

18:10.035 --> 18:12.955
and see to it that he is out of this place.

18:13.235 --> 18:16.755
But there could be few mishaps like that,

18:17.075 --> 18:20.075
maybe some people, one person like that may go out,

18:20.355 --> 18:21.755
then whosoever it may be,

18:21.875 --> 18:24.675
if he is harmful to Sahaja Yoga by any chance,

18:24.875 --> 18:26.875
and if you find there's something going wrong,

18:27.155 --> 18:29.075
you should see that that person goes out of

18:29.355 --> 18:31.875
the circulation of Sahaja Yoga.

18:32.155 --> 18:33.675
He goes out of Melbourne is the best.

18:33.875 --> 18:35.875
Such a person should get out of this place

18:36.075 --> 18:39.155
and should go to another center where he should be tried.

18:39.475 --> 18:41.275
That's how you can shift people

18:41.555 --> 18:44.555
who are little funny and misbehaving.

18:44.875 --> 18:48.675
For example, now as you told Me about some other center,

18:48.955 --> 18:50.555
send that person to Sydney

18:50.755 --> 18:53.475
or some other place to get corrected.

18:53.755 --> 18:56.675
If it doesn't work out in these four centers,

18:56.955 --> 18:59.075
then that person should get out of Sahaja Yoga.

18:59.355 --> 19:01.275
That's the only way for the time being,

19:01.475 --> 19:02.875
get out of it. Stay out.

19:03.075 --> 19:05.555
Or maybe from one center to another center

19:05.875 --> 19:08.755
when you send that person ask him to get out of Sahaja Yoga,

19:09.075 --> 19:11.275
go and stay somewhere else, get lost.

19:11.595 --> 19:14.595
Maybe that person will be all right

19:14.875 --> 19:19.195
because the negative forces are mostly entering

19:19.475 --> 19:20.795
through the people who are weak,

19:23.075 --> 19:24.395
who are low level

19:24.675 --> 19:28.395
or who are attacked by possessions and things like that.

19:28.675 --> 19:32.595
So, because you know the water always goes towards the low level.

19:32.875 --> 19:36.395
In the same way negativity always flows to the low level people

19:36.675 --> 19:39.595
and these low level people try to drag other people

19:39.795 --> 19:42.275
who have gone higher because they feel jealous of them.

19:42.595 --> 19:44.275
If you find any such thing,

19:44.595 --> 19:49.395
then best thing is to ask such a person to get out of the ashrams,

19:49.675 --> 19:51.475
to go and stay somewhere else

19:51.675 --> 19:54.075
or go away from the city for some time

19:54.395 --> 19:56.075
and then return back,

19:56.395 --> 19:59.195
so they realize what it is without Sahaja Yoga

19:59.475 --> 20:01.275
and what it is in Sahaja Yoga.

20:01.595 --> 20:04.195
So they get full idea as to what they are doing.

20:04.475 --> 20:07.955
Sometimes, you know, Sahaja Yoga can be very much taken for granted

20:08.275 --> 20:10.275
because you get every blessing.

20:10.595 --> 20:14.395
You see you get yoga and kshema.

20:14.715 --> 20:18.995
You get children, you get beautiful houses,

20:19.315 --> 20:20.595
you get all the food,

20:20.795 --> 20:23.595
everything is organized for you, God does that.

20:23.915 --> 20:26.315
But then you take it for granted,

20:26.595 --> 20:29.315
and then you start thinking,  "Oh it's why this,

20:29.515 --> 20:32.995
it's why that?" That time one should know that

20:33.715 --> 20:36.395
it's not true, you must know it is God

20:36.715 --> 20:38.395
who is helping you in every way.

20:38.715 --> 20:40.715
We should be grateful to God for all that.

20:40.995 --> 20:43.715
But supposing if such a thing enters into anybody's mind,

20:43.995 --> 20:47.795
then such a person should not get to those ideas

20:47.995 --> 20:49.395
and try to distribute them to others.

20:49.595 --> 20:50.515
It's like a disease again.

20:50.795 --> 20:54.795
Such a person should get out of the ashram.

20:55.115 --> 20:58.195
Go and see for oneself what is it outside.

20:58.515 --> 21:01.115
What is it without Sahaja Yoga?

21:01.395 --> 21:03.995
How you meet people, how they treat you,

21:04.315 --> 21:06.195
what's your situation there.

21:06.395 --> 21:08.995
Then you'll realize what Sahaja Yoga is,

21:09.315 --> 21:12.235
how great it is, how much it has helped you

21:12.515 --> 21:15.315
and how God is kind to you specially,

21:15.635 --> 21:18.835
because those who are outside do not know

21:19.115 --> 21:21.835
these advantages of Sahaja Yoga,

21:22.115 --> 21:23.715
these blessings of Sahaja Yoga.

21:24.035 --> 21:27.715
So as you go out you will see them how they are.

21:28.035 --> 21:32.235
How funny they are, how absurd they are,

21:32.515 --> 21:33.915
and then when you come back

21:34.115 --> 21:36.515
you'll realize the value of Sahaja Yoga.

21:37.315 --> 21:42.515
So one should not accept all these ideas

21:42.835 --> 21:45.515
because it takes then a very long time

21:45.715 --> 21:47.915
for a person to come back, very long time.

21:48.235 --> 21:51.035
Once he goes out of the circulation, he goes out.

21:52.235 --> 21:53.915
As I've told before, many a times,

21:54.235 --> 21:56.835
that we have two types of forces working,

21:57.035 --> 21:58.635
centrifugal, and centripetal.

21:58.915 --> 22:03.235
By centripetal force you are taken inside the Sahaja Yoga.

22:03.515 --> 22:05.315
You are brought in with your Mother's love.

22:05.635 --> 22:08.315
But there's another force which is always equally working

22:08.635 --> 22:11.315
is the centrifugal which makes you

22:11.555 --> 22:14.155
get out of the circulation of Sahaja Yoga

22:14.435 --> 22:15.835
and you go at a tangent.

22:16.155 --> 22:17.755
You see, when you are moving something,

22:17.955 --> 22:19.555
say a stone or something,

22:19.835 --> 22:24.835
fixed with a thread or with a rope and you are moving it,

22:25.155 --> 22:27.555
suddenly you find the same thing

22:27.755 --> 22:29.555
which you are controlling from the center

22:29.835 --> 22:32.555
just gets out in a tangent.

22:32.755 --> 22:34.955
In the same way, it happens in Sahaja Yoga

22:35.235 --> 22:39.555
and once you go out it's very difficult to be picked back

22:39.835 --> 22:41.435
and to put back into circulation.

22:41.755 --> 22:44.835
And such people are always suspected, never trusted

22:45.155 --> 22:47.835
and it's a very difficult thing.

22:48.155 --> 22:51.435
It doesn't work out for months together, sometimes years together.

22:51.755 --> 22:52.835
It's a difficult thing.

22:53.155 --> 22:56.155
So I would suggest that even if you have certain doubts,

22:56.435 --> 22:57.955
you'd better keep them away.

22:58.235 --> 23:00.755
Try to fix your nails higher and higher

23:01.035 --> 23:03.635
and try to cling on to them and cling on to them

23:03.955 --> 23:07.635
because Sahaja Yoga is something so miraculous and so great.

23:08.555 --> 23:11.875
The whole thing is so great that it is not possible

23:12.155 --> 23:15.075
for human beings to conceive what they're achieving.

23:15.355 --> 23:17.955
You have really entered into the Kingdom of God.

23:18.275 --> 23:21.275
But you cannot conceive this still with your brain

23:21.555 --> 23:23.075
that what you have got,

23:23.355 --> 23:28.155
so must know that the greatest of greatest has happened to you.

23:28.755 --> 23:32.355
And to keep it up you must try to

23:34.155 --> 23:37.555
achieve higher levels and higher levels of spirituality

23:37.875 --> 23:40.275
and forget all that, forget other things,

23:40.555 --> 23:42.955
just try to go higher and higher

23:43.275 --> 23:46.755
with your dedication to yourself and to Sahaja Yoga.

23:47.355 --> 23:48.955
I bless you again and again

23:50.275 --> 23:53.555
for a higher ascent in your being

23:53.875 --> 23:56.075
and a deeper enjoyment in life.

23:56.355 --> 23:57.555
May God bless you.

24:16.875 --> 24:19.555
Yogi: How beautifully they have done everything.

24:19.875 --> 24:22.475
I can't help it, it is so beautiful…

24:32.755 --> 24:34.755
Let them relax, let them relax,

24:35.075 --> 24:36.275
you see children would relax now

24:36.475 --> 24:38.355
because it's so much in the vibrations.

24:40.675 --> 24:43.275
Let them relax, don't you worry.

24:44.875 --> 24:47.195
Let them relax. Let them do what they like.

24:48.275 --> 24:50.675
That's all right. And whatever they are,

24:50.955 --> 24:52.475
they are angels.

24:55.075 --> 24:58.875
They're all angels, really they're angels, you don't know.

25:04.195 --> 25:06.675
Yogi:Shall we worship You as Shri Ganesh first Mother?

25:06.875 --> 25:08.075
Yes, yes. It would be a good idea.

25:08.275 --> 25:09.675
Yogi: Then as the Devi?

25:09.875 --> 25:11.195
This is such a nice idea I tell you.

25:11.475 --> 25:12.795
It has never struck Indians.

25:13.075 --> 25:14.875
We have so much of marble in our country.

25:16.955 --> 25:18.875
It's a wonderful idea I tell you.

25:35.795 --> 25:38.195
It never starts before eleven.

25:38.475 --> 25:39.675
It's always a trial,

25:39.955 --> 25:42.195
today My sari was not ready for Me to wear.

25:42.475 --> 25:43.675
I didn't know what to do.
