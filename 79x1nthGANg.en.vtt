00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:07.952
Public Program 23 April 2002
Lütfi Kırdar Congress Palace, Istanbul (Turkey)

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.967
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

00:01:32.711 --> 00:01:40.988
I’m very happy to see you all here
to know about the Truth.

00:01:48.592 --> 00:01:58.054
Whatever is told about your
subtle being is not yet known,

00:02:06.948 --> 00:02:14.833
because in your awareness
you don’t have yet that subtleness.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:36.357
That’s the last, the jump into your awareness of collectivity.

00:03:00.895 --> 00:03:03.734
I must tell you that in this country,

00:03:04.007 --> 00:03:08.755
that is Turkey, you had  so many Sufis.

00:03:16.252 --> 00:03:19.476
They called themselves Sufis

00:03:19.492 --> 00:03:27.754
because they were cleaned and they were spiritually empowered.

00:03:41.015 --> 00:03:53.845
They talked of Ruh (spirit) but nobody knew about Ruh

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:04.444
and when they talked of Ruh
they did not know how to explain

00:04:12.098 --> 00:04:25.218
– they talked of Ruhani life, but they could not
explain what is Ruhani (spiritual)  life.

00:04:30.532 --> 00:04:40.612
Ruhani is the life when you are connected
with the all-pervading power of Divine love.

00:04:48.551 --> 00:04:52.272
It is a different area into which you enter.

00:04:57.899 --> 00:05:05.713
Because they could not explain,
they wrote everything beautifully, describing it.

00:05:13.551 --> 00:05:19.859
But now the time has come for you to get your Ruhani life.

00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:30.416
Which is a very important thing,

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:37.383
because if you are not connected to the divine power,

00:05:37.517 --> 00:05:43.227
whatever you may try,
whatever how so ever you will pray,

00:05:43.267 --> 00:05:46.540
how much you will read Kuran, it won’t help.

00:06:06.325 --> 00:06:11.354
Human life is governed with jealousy,

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:15.685
with temper, with all kinds of malignant things.

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:30.664
And we can see all over the world
the problems are just spreading.

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.216
Once they will get into Ruhani life,

00:06:41.288 --> 00:06:47.686
they will realize that the whole world is one,
there is a global existence.

00:06:59.627 --> 00:07:05.409
What happens  that you jump into the ocean of Love,

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:17.417
of pure Love, no lust, no greed, nothing.

00:07:26.201 --> 00:07:28.272
That’s has to happen

00:07:28.365 --> 00:07:34.889
because if we are born as human beings,
we must get Ruhani life,

00:07:43.962 --> 00:07:52.462
for which you cannot pay, you cannot read it,

00:07:52.802 --> 00:07:58.433
you cannot understand it with
your human awareness.

00:08:01.507 --> 00:08:07.095
So, you have to enter into a new dimension of your awareness.

00:08:15.883 --> 00:08:20.838
Nobody understood the Sufis and they just tortured them,

00:08:26.845 --> 00:08:31.134
because they were so different, so much higher.

00:08:31.159 --> 00:08:33.536
Others could not bear it.

00:08:43.647 --> 00:08:48.889
And today, that is going on,
people are fighting all over the world.

00:08:57.737 --> 00:09:02.261
So this is the life of pure Love;

00:09:06.501 --> 00:09:15.326
but not forced, not taught
is just  within you, already existing.

00:09:22.864 --> 00:09:27.545
You do not know your worth,
you do not know what you have.

00:09:32.509 --> 00:09:37.816
All the saints came here, incarnations came here,

00:09:37.841 --> 00:09:42.218
prophets came here, nobody understood them.

00:09:50.901 --> 00:09:53.508
They only killed them

00:10:01.597 --> 00:10:06.588
because majority of the people were not Ruhani.

00:10:10.968 --> 00:10:15.615
So, all such ignorant people could not bear the knowledge,

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:19.452
the divine knowledge of these great people.

00:10:28.936 --> 00:10:34.498
Now the time has come for the whole world to become one

00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:42.821
and to jump into the sea of Love.

00:10:46.469 --> 00:10:55.489
Which is very, very simple, it is very easy.

00:10:56.993 --> 00:11:01.535
As I told you, we have already that power,

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:06.979
placed in the triangular bone of sacrum
within us by our Creator,

00:11:16.137 --> 00:11:18.807
which is to be awakened.

00:11:21.087 --> 00:11:25.772
And once it is awakened,
it passes through your  centers

00:11:25.892 --> 00:11:42.506
and cleanses  them, enlightens them,
and integrates them.

00:11:47.602 --> 00:11:53.340
And ultimately, this Kundalini
connects you to the divine power.

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:06.484
This is what is Miraj (ascension)  as described in the Qur’an.

00:12:10.537 --> 00:12:13.767
And all of you can get this Miraj (ascension)

00:12:16.697 --> 00:12:21.952
and once you get it you can experiment
and get it on your finger tips

00:12:31.804 --> 00:12:40.060
the cool breeze of the surrounding power of Love.

00:12:40.118 --> 00:12:42.296
You can feel it on the fingertips.

00:12:49.247 --> 00:12:53.485
That is the proof.
There is no false certificate about it.

00:13:03.583 --> 00:13:09.563
And ultimately, you can also get it coming
out of your fontanel bone area.

00:13:20.585 --> 00:13:30.807
This is the last bone which was pulsating as a child,

00:13:38.737 --> 00:13:41.203
and then it closed.

00:13:45.657 --> 00:13:49.884
But when the Kundalini pierces through that,

00:13:50.693 --> 00:13:58.183
then only you can feel the connection as cool breeze
coming out  of your own being.

00:14:11.712 --> 00:14:14.981
You have shown so much faith in God,

00:14:15.006 --> 00:14:20.182
so much faith in Kuran, so much faith in Islam,

00:14:20.277 --> 00:14:25.170
but you have to surrender, Islam means to surrender,

00:14:25.195 --> 00:14:28.704
and then you can achieve this awareness,

00:14:28.729 --> 00:14:32.959
this higher awareness of divinity within you.

00:14:46.957 --> 00:14:50.317
After getting these vibrations also,

00:14:50.439 --> 00:14:59.394
you can develop a power to know
what is wrong within you, within your chakras.

00:15:12.156 --> 00:15:15.445
and also you can make out what is wrong with others.

00:15:21.036 --> 00:15:24.076
That is how your awareness expands,

00:15:27.772 --> 00:15:35.363
expands to the new dimension of Ruhani.

00:15:42.626 --> 00:15:44.564
You all have to become Sufis.

00:15:49.146 --> 00:15:53.912
But now do not write poetry,
because people do not understand poetry.

00:15:57.364 --> 00:15:59.414
They misinterpret.

00:16:05.228 --> 00:16:09.156
I can also write poetry, but I don`t want

00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:16.621
because I want you to know directly what is the Truth.

00:16:21.138 --> 00:16:27.544
Now I must tell you one thing:
you have a well-named country called France;

00:16:34.555 --> 00:16:37.829
among all the European countries,

00:16:37.854 --> 00:16:40.715
they are the most idiotic people I’ve seen.

00:16:51.504 --> 00:16:57.471
Extremely dirty, they like to have
smelling food smelling everything

00:16:57.496 --> 00:17:01.281
and drink all the time.

00:17:10.085 --> 00:17:24.968
And they eat such varied cheese, I mean I don’t know
how they could eat, even dogs do not.

00:17:27.278 --> 00:17:30.353
And they talk about culture.

00:17:34.118 --> 00:17:36.789
They are so immoral.

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:47.158
There are eleven countries in South Africa.

00:17:47.251 --> 00:17:50.042
Benin is one of them

00:17:54.891 --> 00:17:58.613
and they all have become Muslims.

00:18:03.789 --> 00:18:08.962
I asked them: “why did you become Muslims
and not Christians like these?”.

00:18:15.226 --> 00:18:24.144
They said our rulers, they are horrible people
who were so dirty, so filthy and smelled.

00:18:35.929 --> 00:18:38.427
So many people tried to…

00:18:42.369 --> 00:18:47.431
There is a writer called Molière
who told about them, made fun of them.

00:18:52.359 --> 00:18:56.602
And there is a beautiful booklet, novel,

00:18:56.627 --> 00:18:58.912
written by another writer,

00:18:58.937 --> 00:19:02.206
who has shown how stupid they are.

00:19:11.809 --> 00:19:17.918
They have to learn from you.

00:19:22.009 --> 00:19:28.280
You are so different, you are so capable.

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:36.584
I mean I must say you are such a sensible, lovely people;

00:19:41.711 --> 00:19:47.782
but keep to your sense, keep to your intelligence.

00:19:56.083 --> 00:19:58.150
I am telling you about French

00:19:58.191 --> 00:20:01.215
because nowadays they are trying to influence you,

00:20:08.487 --> 00:20:16.347
also your television. Be careful.

00:20:18.587 --> 00:20:21.274
They do not know what Ruh is.

00:20:25.669 --> 00:20:37.659
God knows what sort of Christianity is that,
just the opposite of Christ.

00:20:38.006 --> 00:20:50.946
So please try to keep to your own culture
and to your understanding.

00:20:52.758 --> 00:20:56.087
And you can get your Realization in no time.

00:20:59.754 --> 00:21:05.322
I came to Turkey, because if you remember
Christ’s Mother also came here.

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:14.625
And I know why she came here;

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:28.240
because the people here are extremely good
and so many Sufis.

00:21:29.702 --> 00:21:33.901
It is such a joyful place.

00:21:38.361 --> 00:21:43.052
I think you all will get your Realization, no doubt.

00:21:47.122 --> 00:21:53.422
Those of course who do not want can go.

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.860
This is a very simple thing.

00:22:00.764 --> 00:22:05.110
In the meanwhile, I would like you to ask me some questions.

00:22:46.379 --> 00:22:52.118
Interpreter: Rumi has a saying.
Mevlana Rumi says,

00:22:52.578 --> 00:22:58.435
if I reveal the secret, either I will burn or
people will burn, everyone will burn.

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:00.322
That is true,

00:23:00.353 --> 00:23:03.688
that was the time that because not aware.

00:23:10.299 --> 00:23:17.067
What he said is truth because
people don’t understand what is reality,

00:23:17.116 --> 00:23:18.720
they can’t believe like that,

00:23:18.753 --> 00:23:20.546
they crucified Christ,

00:23:20.571 --> 00:23:23.993
they tortured Muhammed Sahab,
they tortured everybody.

00:24:17.779 --> 00:24:21.772
Interpreter: You said about love,

00:24:23.063 --> 00:24:29.710
he is thinking to love that you mean,
he was just thanking you.

00:24:29.735 --> 00:24:32.370
All right. Thank you, thank you very much.

00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:37.238
I am not afraid. They can burn me, I don`t care.

00:25:08.711 --> 00:25:12.334
Interpreter: What you said about the French people who acted against world peace.

00:25:12.367 --> 00:25:14.806
Does that mean the  whole of the  French people?

00:25:15.017 --> 00:25:18.157
No, no, there are exceptions, of course,

00:25:18.182 --> 00:25:20.066
there are many exceptions, no doubt,

00:25:20.091 --> 00:25:23.467
that's how I came to normal.

00:25:52.627 --> 00:25:58.553
Interpreter: She said Reiki and she doing together
with Sahaja Yoga another Reiki.

00:26:22.267 --> 00:26:26.086
Please, I would say, don’t do it.

00:26:53.052 --> 00:26:59.162
Interpreter: Why it doesn't go, Reiki and Sahaja Yoga
why it doesn't  go together?

00:26:59.632 --> 00:27:04.107
Because I see people who do that, get sick,

00:27:08.338 --> 00:27:11.028
There is no science behind it.

00:27:16.008 --> 00:27:23.268
You must know what for you understand, not blind for it.

00:27:45.453 --> 00:27:48.834
Interpreter: What about there  after death?

00:27:50.044 --> 00:27:54.153
That's mean discuss that death,
you're very young, goes in process.

00:28:08.951 --> 00:28:11.284
Interpreter: Do you think about it.

00:28:11.318 --> 00:28:14.570
No

00:29:02.290 --> 00:29:07.035
Interpreter:  What is the cause of lying, why do people lie?

00:29:07.962 --> 00:29:09.612
Because they don't know the truth.

00:29:13.293 --> 00:29:17.493
What only the trac**************** the power of truth.

00:29:48.242 --> 00:29:53.496
Interpreter: What is the benefit of yoga,
is yoga the power of thoughts.

00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:57.389
No, no, no.

00:29:57.414 --> 00:29:59.375
Beyond thinking you go,

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:05.316
that will not be dangerous for you

00:30:07.004 --> 00:30:09.114
You go beyond  thinking.

00:30:12.035 --> 00:30:14.854
Interpreter:How, how we go beyond thinking?

00:30:14.887 --> 00:30:18.143
With the Kundalini, it takes  you there.

00:30:23.703 --> 00:30:28.285
Interpreter: Is it the power which awakens, the Kundalini,

00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:31.828
is it the power of thinking

00:30:34.215 --> 00:30:49.244
No, It is all pervading power, once you get
your realization instead of talking this matter.

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:22.851
Interpreter: Could you explain the meaning of bindi?

00:31:22.868 --> 00:31:27.411
It is in India, we put all married women, alright?

00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:58.349
Interpreter: We heard that people wash
your feet and drink the water from your feet

00:31:58.450 --> 00:32:02.172
and why the people bow in front of you?

00:32:16.744 --> 00:32:18.205
All false.

00:32:34.936 --> 00:32:36.413
Interpreter: Is this a sect?

00:32:36.438 --> 00:32:37.580
for what?

00:32:50.993 --> 00:32:54.479
Interpreter: People bow front  on you, is this a sect?

00:32:54.555 --> 00:32:56.293
Of course they bow on me,

00:32:56.303 --> 00:32:59.765
if the people wants to bow, what can I do?

00:34:03.786 --> 00:34:07.787
Interpreter: How can people understand your value, your worth?

00:34:07.803 --> 00:34:11.083
First you get your self realization, you will know yourself

00:34:11.121 --> 00:34:14.333
then, you don't know yourself, how can know me?

00:35:00.298 --> 00:35:02.736
Interpreter: For what reason have  you started that mission?

00:35:02.769 --> 00:35:05.800
Don’t you think you need peace?

00:36:16.916 --> 00:36:24.189
Interpreter: The question is, the sufi's
don't have realization from the prophet,

00:36:24.246 --> 00:36:30.707
where did you get your realization from
and do you see yourself as a prophet?

00:36:30.741 --> 00:36:32.313
Don't worry about me.

00:37:20.507 --> 00:37:24.872
Interpreter: I beleive in Yoga and
I want to do know that, I beleive that

00:37:24.913 --> 00:37:29.324
in the country where the yoga is most needed now  is  Israel.

00:37:29.381 --> 00:37:33.658
What do you think about this?

00:37:37.536 --> 00:37:41.299
You can't help them, historically they are stupid.

00:38:36.977 --> 00:38:40.146
Interpreter: She is inviting you to Ankara next year.

00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:44.757
Very nice, thanks …..
thank you very much.

00:39:40.590 --> 00:39:44.883
Interpreter: What part affects the rise of Kundalini?

00:39:47.170 --> 00:39:51.480
How does your past life affect the rise of the Kundalini?

00:40:00.664 --> 00:40:03.038
but we can work  it  out,

00:40:03.063 --> 00:40:07.490
but you dont have to  worry about  past,
we have to think about present.

00:41:06.574 --> 00:41:10.075
Interpreter: we have some physical world problems

00:41:10.115 --> 00:41:16.358
and he is asking that it would be
dangerous for  them to keep Kundalini to rise,

00:41:16.397 --> 00:41:21.754
why there is this physical health problems.

00:41:28.623 --> 00:41:34.881
About cleaning the body, does he have to clean
the body before the having  the realization.

00:41:35.034 --> 00:41:39.432
Not necessarily, but people do it, good.

00:42:10.537 --> 00:42:14.015
Interpreter: He is asking if we can we self-realization?

00:42:14.087 --> 00:42:15.031
Of course.

00:42:15.079 --> 00:42:17.812
Interpreter: Just, there is one question,

00:42:17.837 --> 00:42:21.317
Most of them [UNCLEAR] one has to have realization.

00:42:48.339 --> 00:42:51.919
Interpreter:,Every messenger has to face next goal

00:42:51.994 --> 00:42:56.258
what do you ... what is  your next, next to  goal,

00:42:56.283 --> 00:42:58.657
do you see yourself as a prophet?

00:42:58.682 --> 00:43:03.285
You don't have to find out about me,
you have to find out yourself

00:43:58.532 --> 00:44:06.575
Interpreter: He is asking that do you think
those sufis had their Kundalini awaken

00:44:08.169 --> 00:44:09.372
Most of them had.

00:44:19.353 --> 00:44:23.519
Interpreter: and he says that most of them
is not succeeded in save the humans.

00:44:23.548 --> 00:44:24.803
They were tortured,

00:44:24.828 --> 00:44:29.030
how do you think you are going to succeed to save the humanity?

00:44:29.099 --> 00:44:32.039
People are so bad and so cruelly,

00:44:32.073 --> 00:44:35.239
and they always torture the good people.

00:44:44.636 --> 00:44:47.128
What is humanity now.

00:44:55.853 --> 00:45:00.120
Interpreter: What is the difference between
Kundalini and Prana?

00:45:00.214 --> 00:45:02.745
You get your realization you will know.

00:45:04.889 --> 00:45:06.967
Interpreter: Do you want your self realization?

00:45:20.849 --> 00:45:23.458
Interpreter: Can we shut down these (air conditoners)

00:46:13.823 --> 00:46:18.271
In Quran, Muhammed Sahap has said,

00:46:18.351 --> 00:46:21.854
at the time of resurrection,
your hands will speak.

00:46:28.935 --> 00:46:31.577
This is the Ruh.

00:46:39.525 --> 00:46:44.461
If they don't speak, the something wrong.

00:46:50.231 --> 00:46:52.151
Please close your eyes,

00:46:52.163 --> 00:46:57.763
there is no mesmering that is going on.

00:47:23.801 --> 00:47:28.975
Dont worry about me, worry about yourself.

00:47:50.134 --> 00:47:53.254
Put the hands to me like you do in Namaz.

00:47:58.843 --> 00:48:13.140
(Shri Mataji:blowing towards to microphone)

00:48:40.164 --> 00:48:43.321
Now see, there is cool breeze [UNCLEAR].

00:48:47.234 --> 00:48:49.575
it could be also hot.

00:48:51.369 --> 00:48:56.389
Doesnt matter, it will cool down.

00:49:01.009 --> 00:49:04.550
Now put your right hand to top of your head,

00:49:08.017 --> 00:49:12.210
above the fontenella bone area,

00:49:12.242 --> 00:49:14.888
hot or cool breeze, see for yourself

00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:18.107
There is a cool breeze coming out of your head

00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:20.594
[UNCLEAR]

00:49:32.437 --> 00:49:34.944
If it is hot also, doesn’t matter,

00:49:38.177 --> 00:49:40.060
but it should be cool

00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:44.777
after sometime it will become cool.

00:49:48.767 --> 00:49:51.607
for which you have to meditate.

00:49:54.009 --> 00:49:56.679
They will teach you how to do it.

00:49:59.679 --> 00:50:03.307
There are many centers lucky  here.

00:50:18.126 --> 00:50:22.304
Again put your hands towards me,

00:50:23.821 --> 00:50:27.503
like this, like this.

00:50:31.075 --> 00:50:33.345
like this.

00:50:50.477 --> 00:50:55.214
All those who have felt the cool breeze

00:50:55.239 --> 00:51:00.131
on the fingertips or on their plam

00:51:00.283 --> 00:51:07.121
or out of the head, can raise your hands.

00:51:57.867 --> 00:52:06.267
You don't have to pay as your not get
anything for  the realization

00:52:06.914 --> 00:52:09.526
You don't have to pay anything.

00:52:17.683 --> 00:52:20.914
Gradually you learn everything on your fingertips

00:52:27.878 --> 00:52:30.277
If you have any problems,

00:52:30.302 --> 00:52:33.062
let it down and lets  [UNCLEAR]

00:52:38.481 --> 00:52:41.681
Thank you very much, I love you very much.
