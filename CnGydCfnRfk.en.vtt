00:02.563 --> 00:05.793
So today is a very, very important day, you know that;

00:07.270 --> 00:13.079
because in the history of creation,

00:13.919 --> 00:21.211
till the time of Christ, in the human awareness,

00:21.755 --> 00:25.474
only the sense of resurrection was created

00:25.713 --> 00:30.485
– that you can be resurrected or you can be reborn.

00:31.722 --> 00:37.142
That sense came down with them. People recognised it, that

00:37.437 --> 00:41.632
it could happen to all of us, sometime.

00:41.972 --> 00:45.851
But it did not happen.

00:46.643 --> 00:51.849
Actualisation never took place. That was a problem.

00:52.462 --> 00:56.821
And without you entering into the Reality,

00:57.049 --> 01:04.304
whatever one may talk about, it sounds imaginative.

01:06.258 --> 01:09.682
So, one has to jump into the Reality,

01:10.060 --> 01:11.667
into the truth.

01:12.242 --> 01:14.583
This never had happened before

01:14.941 --> 01:18.809
and, as I have told you that,
if it had happened to one or two people

01:18.929 --> 01:22.163
it makes no difference at all, to the masses,

01:22.460 --> 01:24.265
and nobody accepts it.

01:24.485 --> 01:27.897
And like the small little river flowing in the desert

01:28.104 --> 01:30.247
it disappears in the thin air.

01:30.486 --> 01:33.284
The truth also, whatever was found out,

01:33.598 --> 01:35.604
never had any roots.

01:36.280 --> 01:41.141
And all kinds of funny things started with this reality,

01:41.281 --> 01:44.805
which these people preached.

01:45.208 --> 01:54.905
So it was to be the culmination of human consciousness,

01:55.561 --> 01:59.980
where he becomes one with the Divine.

02:00.121 --> 02:02.342
That he becomes one with himself.

02:02.482 --> 02:05.180
It was to happen.

02:06.034 --> 02:13.521
And that too was to happen at the time,

02:14.097 --> 02:17.866
which was most opportune, the best time.

02:20.284 --> 02:27.338
Because, unless and until the human desire is very strong,

02:28.113 --> 02:36.961
the human will is very strong and is asking for the Reality,

02:37.616 --> 02:40.552
the Reality does not go into action.

02:43.866 --> 02:49.397
Other things, of course, as far as the creation is concerned,

02:49.517 --> 02:57.512
creating the animals and all the trees and the fruits and flowers,

02:58.128 --> 03:00.548
all these things are done.

03:01.778 --> 03:06.858
But the human evolution could not have matured earlier

03:07.155 --> 03:11.200
because there was not so much of seeking.

03:11.597 --> 03:13.898
So when the time came,

03:18.442 --> 03:24.176
when the necessity was so great
that the necessity itself brought forth Sahaja Yoga.

03:30.010 --> 03:34.402
And it happened that I really saw the Sahastrara.

03:35.473 --> 03:40.314
Of course, you know there’s a difference between
your Sahastrara and mine.

03:40.474 --> 03:49.174
And I saw the Sahastrara, which is the Great Sahastrara,
opening out beautifully.

03:49.520 --> 04:00.471
And the petals were just like flames,

04:00.999 --> 04:04.975
rounded flames; not like flames but rounded ones:

04:06.245 --> 04:11.024
rounded, beautifully coloured flames, of different colours.

04:11.143 --> 04:16.410
That’s why I wore today a blouse of many
colours and a sari of many colours.

04:16.818 --> 04:29.151
Because I saw so many permutations and combinations of these.
It opened out so beautifully.

04:29.417 --> 04:33.529
And as if every petal was individually,

04:33.695 --> 04:38.568
absolutely complete and perfect, but so integrated at the base.

04:39.144 --> 04:43.608
And the way it opened out, and the movement,
was so rhythmic and so harmonious.

04:43.906 --> 04:47.752
There was no problem. Such a harmony was between them;

04:47.951 --> 04:53.151
no fluctuation anywhere.

04:54.221 --> 04:57.754
As if they were dancing to the tune, they opened out.

04:58.784 --> 05:03.999
And the colours, all spread out their light around the aura.

05:04.220 --> 05:10.319
And in the centre I saw the Agnya (inaudible),
or you can say the Sun colour,

05:10.527 --> 05:15.398
and all the chakras from there also emitting light.

05:16.371 --> 05:20.671
But the chakras were darker in shades and they were emitting.

05:20.810 --> 05:25.334
So dark that they were all looking blackish, so dark.

05:25.479 --> 05:28.888
Sort of a condensed colour they had.

05:29.052 --> 05:33.630
And they were also emitting light all over.

05:33.829 --> 05:40.158
And the light, as soon as the whole thing opened out,
the light absolutely spread out,

05:40.773 --> 05:46.331
and then I said “It’s done,” it can be done.

05:47.661 --> 05:57.263
So, first I had to open out my Sahastrara itself,
then your Sahastraras could be opened out.

05:57.859 --> 06:04.701
And then I felt that, a tremendous flow of my grace,

06:05.257 --> 06:12.749
started flowing. So much grace, even upon me.

06:13.008 --> 06:18.920
Like torrential rain on me.

06:19.258 --> 06:24.741
Absolutely I was so drenched in that joy.
Really I was lost, absolutely lost.

06:25.535 --> 06:41.547
I felt that the whole Creation is now resounding
with that Universal Consciousness.

06:41.822 --> 06:43.409
Just like that.

06:44.818 --> 06:50.529
Everything was finished. Only the joy was permeating.

06:50.807 --> 06:54.120
It was such a beautiful time.

06:54.756 --> 06:57.989
And then I started my work.

06:58.486 --> 07:04.497
But as you know, in the beginning,
it’s very difficult to talk about these things.

07:04.934 --> 07:11.580
To begin with it is very difficult for a person to say that
“I am such and such.”

07:11.740 --> 07:16.620
It’s a really embarrassing stuff.
It’s extremely embarrassing to tell someone.

07:16.938 --> 07:21.377
I mean if you have some power,
or something you feel shy to talk about that.

07:21.497 --> 07:25.187
You just don’t want to stand out and be singled out.

07:25.451 --> 07:31.052
You feel so lonely about it and
you don’t want to mention it to anyone.

07:31.179 --> 07:33.937
I managed it for quite some time.

07:34.029 --> 07:36.100
But when the Sahastrara opened out,

07:36.219 --> 07:40.008
I knew that I will have to come out in my true colours.

07:40.068 --> 07:47.568
Of course, not yet, I have not yet come out
because that would be terrible. But, as it is,

07:47.746 --> 07:54.942
when the Sahastrara opened out
I realised that the instrument is now operative.

07:57.264 --> 08:01.350
So this Instrument that is before

08:01.510 --> 08:08.925
you is the Instrument by which you are going to know the truth.

08:09.149 --> 08:13.608
You can find out the truth now, through this Instrument of mine.

08:15.313 --> 08:20.100
Because through this Instrument
you will get your Kundalini awakened,

08:20.319 --> 08:22.402
you’ll get your Realisation.

08:22.780 --> 08:27.521
And through your vibrations you will be able

08:27.661 --> 08:29.505
to know the Truth.

08:29.585 --> 08:36.847
You already know that the rapport between
you and the Truth has started.

08:37.046 --> 08:41.700
You can ask any question and you get the answer.

08:46.423 --> 08:53.406
So, first of all the Truth will be known,

08:53.604 --> 08:57.176
and that Truth, once you know,

08:57.296 --> 09:02.377
will be followed by another dimension of that Truth

09:02.516 --> 09:06.367
and another dimension. And I knew a stage will be reached

09:06.485 --> 09:11.427
where I will have to give the whole of it.

09:11.745 --> 09:15.046
And the whole of it you have got it.

09:15.178 --> 09:20.224
But this Instrument has a special thing about it,

09:20.959 --> 09:27.129
because Sahastrara is, the essence of Sahastrara,

09:28.419 --> 09:32.288
is integration, is ekagrata.

09:35.863 --> 09:38.130
I have told you what is ekagrata:

09:38.621 --> 09:44.870
that is all the holes of all the needles if you put together

09:44.970 --> 09:50.905
and thread them together that is called as ‘ekagra’.

09:51.041 --> 09:54.808
‘Agra’ means ‘the end’, ‘ek’ means ‘one’.

09:54.933 --> 09:58.697
All the ends are put through one string.

10:00.206 --> 10:02.822
Now what does this means?

10:03.043 --> 10:05.877
In a very subtle way if we understand

10:06.037 --> 10:10.223
that all the chakras are threaded into my Being.

10:14.429 --> 10:18.229
That means all types of patterns that have been created,

10:24.546 --> 10:32.144
all types of religions, all types of faiths,
all types of ideas, all types of enterprises,

10:32.700 --> 10:37.167
science, yogas, everything!

10:38.177 --> 10:41.668
All of them are threaded in this Being.

10:43.057 --> 10:58.519
So supposing you are a hatha yogi, then you have to just
ask question, “Mother, are you hatha yoga?” finished.

10:59.621 --> 11:07.525
If you are doing Raja Yoga, you just ask,
“Mother, are you Raja Yoga?”

11:07.627 --> 11:13.080
If you are a Christian, just ask, “Mother, are you Christ?”

11:14.807 --> 11:21.657
If you are a Muslim you just ask, “Mother, are you the Prophet?”

11:22.927 --> 11:27.510
Even if you are people who do not believe in God,

11:27.947 --> 11:32.563
[you] say, “Are You the Abstract Image?

11:33.129 --> 11:37.523
Are You Buddha? Are You Mahavira?” All of them are with me.

11:37.762 --> 11:42.761
So that all of you, wherever you may be,
whatever you might have developed,

11:42.881 --> 11:48.853
nothing is wasted, but is given a proper meaning.

11:49.369 --> 11:54.390
But with that meaning you will be integrated with others also.

11:54.542 --> 11:57.743
Because there’s One Personality, which has all these within.

11:57.862 --> 12:01.972
Like one thousand names of one Goddess.

12:02.148 --> 12:05.047
So automatically they will be integrated.

12:05.266 --> 12:08.847
You can be a Hindu, you can be a Muslim, you can be a Christian,

12:08.975 --> 12:12.021
if you want to call yourself something like that.

12:12.260 --> 12:17.954
But once you become a Sahaja Yogi you are all integrated.

12:18.508 --> 12:20.908
You can go to Church, if you want to,

12:21.167 --> 12:23.390
you can go to a Mosque if you want to,

12:23.529 --> 12:26.529
but you know who is the person who is there.

12:26.863 --> 12:28.530
Do you follow that point?

12:28.926 --> 12:32.977
This is the essence of Sahastrara.

12:34.049 --> 12:38.158
And for that reason we have to give up our misidentifications.

12:39.606 --> 12:42.424
Like if you say, “I am a Christian,

12:42.583 --> 12:48.376
” then how are you a Christian? “I am Church of England,”
that’s not the way to understand.

12:48.595 --> 12:54.309
You are a Christian, alright, then you are following Christ,

12:54.409 --> 12:57.087
because I am Christ.

12:58.119 --> 13:03.652
If everybody is following one lamppost,

13:05.076 --> 13:07.993
you can say, then they are all integrating.

13:08.357 --> 13:12.325
You may seek from one angle another may seek from another angle,

13:12.517 --> 13:17.103
but by this integration you will realise

13:17.208 --> 13:20.159
that the Light is the same.

13:20.318 --> 13:25.925
So all these years, the way
people have been fighting and quarrelling,

13:26.521 --> 13:29.721
all that is going to be absolutely neutralised.

13:30.349 --> 13:33.356
This is the beauty of integration.

13:33.521 --> 13:35.375
Anywhere in the world,

13:35.500 --> 13:38.500
whatever they are following can be answered.

13:38.624 --> 13:43.274
But supposing its some sort of a falsehood thing like voodoo,

13:43.691 --> 13:47.291
then I am not that. Of course not.

13:49.789 --> 13:51.733
I am not falsehood.

13:51.912 --> 13:53.990
Whatever is the Truth,

13:54.114 --> 13:59.292
whatever you have followed something
which is called as ‘truth’ – which is called, also.

13:59.431 --> 14:03.360
In the sense, like Christianity is not Truth,

14:03.667 --> 14:05.602
Christ is the Truth.

14:06.594 --> 14:10.165
But if you are a Christian and followed Christ

14:10.324 --> 14:14.629
in a false way, because following
pope is not following Christ at all.

14:15.257 --> 14:19.344
Or say, becoming a Church of England,
this thing is not following Christ.

14:19.464 --> 14:24.047
But, if you have been following Christ even through
Church of England,

14:24.186 --> 14:29.404
it’s alright. Even through pope it’s alright.

14:29.900 --> 14:33.967
Because now you have found out the Truth.

14:38.988 --> 14:44.966
So this was a very important and a crucial day
I would say, the 5th of May.

14:45.125 --> 14:49.390
And it all happened very dramatically, extremely dramatically,

14:49.549 --> 14:59.648
that I went to a programme, not a programme, but

15:00.065 --> 15:07.265
I went to find out about one of the horrid rakshasas’ places,
to see what sort of a thing he was about to.

15:09.430 --> 15:16.053
And of course I had made my own arrangements
and I stayed in a friend’s place.

15:16.212 --> 15:20.934
But I went to the camp to see what he was doing, what was he up to;

15:21.034 --> 15:27.119
in a very simple innocent way, he could never
have guessed that I was up to some mischief!

15:27.243 --> 15:30.802
Extremely simple and innocent.

15:30.910 --> 15:33.898
I look so innocent don’t take me for that.

15:34.116 --> 15:40.187
I am very clever! So I went down

15:40.287 --> 15:46.140
and the fellow thought me to be a great disciple
of his and all that. (laughing)

15:46.259 --> 15:49.691
Then I went to the seashore

15:50.167 --> 15:53.314
and I saw what he was up to, I was so angry,

15:53.474 --> 15:59.009
I said, “Now, what is it?” I said, “I must hurry up.
It has to be done now. It’s no more time needed.

15:59.148 --> 16:01.415
Because just see what is he up to!”

16:01.554 --> 16:07.228
He was working on a chakra which is to be worshipped

16:07.605 --> 16:10.423
and I felt that I must do something about it.

16:10.561 --> 16:17.927
And really it happened, that I could just open out the Sahastrara.
I said,

16:18.087 --> 16:23.808
“That’s it!” Because as you must’ve heard
that Goddess has no [purpose].

16:23.960 --> 16:27.528
She’s nishprayojana, She’s purposeless, She has no purpose at all.

16:27.628 --> 16:30.008
But, if the purpose comes in Her way,

16:30.128 --> 16:31.695
then She may do something.

16:31.795 --> 16:37.707
But She doesn’t have Her own purpose.
She’s absolutely purposeless, useless! Without any desire.

16:37.926 --> 16:42.369
Imagine! Without any attributes.

16:43.183 --> 16:45.849
What a thing and a half, whatever it is!

16:46.041 --> 16:51.841
Such a personality when It is faced with a demand like that,
comes up with it’s form.

16:52.833 --> 16:58.324
So now you understand from there that, on this Sahastrara day,

17:00.289 --> 17:02.856
you have to also demand.

17:03.352 --> 17:09.542
I want you to demand and ask, because I have no desire.

17:10.614 --> 17:15.315
And you just go ahead! You have all the rights to demand from me.

17:15.872 --> 17:22.655
And ask for the biggest and the highest
and the most fantastic and the most dynamic

17:22.854 --> 17:25.353
that you want to do.

17:26.445 --> 17:29.388
Put up your minds and heads together,

17:29.719 --> 17:32.146
and ask for something big.

17:32.821 --> 17:36.829
This is a very great day today. Go home, think about it.

17:37.048 --> 17:40.956
Collectively also you decide. I’ll go now, so then you decide

17:41.175 --> 17:46.948
and put a demand and it could be done! Now,
thy will be done, not mine.

18:34.399 --> 18:38.882
So, I will make a move now. I hope all of you will come on the 7th

18:39.161 --> 18:42.077
and bring all your friends and all that.

18:42.811 --> 18:45.152
We might get a big crowd, I can’t say.

18:45.589 --> 18:47.330
But crowd is a crowd.

18:47.588 --> 18:49.417
Sahaja Yogis are Sahaja Yogis.

18:49.497 --> 18:53.485
You might get a big crowd out of which, we put in them in the sea

18:53.584 --> 18:55.489
you’ll find only two remaining back.

18:55.549 --> 18:57.482
So sahaja yogi is different.

18:57.652 --> 19:04.992
We might get a crowd. I don’t know depends on Caxton Hall maybe.

19:12.491 --> 19:14.754
Thanks to Caxton Hall Meeting

19:14.893 --> 19:23.246
that my children have lost all their seats and all their ??

19:24.278 --> 19:28.544
Douglas Fry: I thought something would come of it.
Shri Mataji: Ha ha! You knew that.

19:28.687 --> 19:31.099
Douglas Fry: I knew something funny would happen, it had to!

19:31.263 --> 19:34.478
There is a saying that ‘When the fox has to die,

19:34.667 --> 19:36.005
he runs towards the city.’

19:36.244 --> 19:41.918
Then they told me they are coming to the Caxton Hall I said,

19:42.176 --> 19:44.180
“Very good idea!” You see that’s a very good trap.

19:44.359 --> 19:46.759
And not a single person,

19:48.000 --> 19:54.936
all of them lost their vibrations.
Sahaja Yogi: They went down (not clear)

19:57.086 --> 19:59.368
Even that...

20:01.271 --> 20:04.170
You see hatred is not going to work out.

20:05.618 --> 20:10.074
It’s nice, in a way, this lady has also come, lets see,
she’s after all a woman

20:10.293 --> 20:14.293
and we can work on her. Though she’s also with this crowd.

20:16.078 --> 20:19.459
Sahaja Yogi: She has a colossal of ego.
Shri Mataji: She has, for a woman, eh!

20:24.242 --> 20:30.483
She does. I shook hand with her, raised her Kundalini
and with the speed with which it raised I felt wawa!

20:36.246 --> 20:39.192
I’ll raise her Kundalini all right. Don’t say.

20:39.788 --> 20:42.202
Not much hope from her but, you see.

20:42.341 --> 20:44.839
We might get a good group.

20:45.008 --> 20:47.170
There’s Lord Hailsham,

20:47.295 --> 20:51.035
I met him in a dinner very, very intimate dinner we had.

20:51.154 --> 20:55.606
Dr. Nagendra Singh was there and he told that
She is a very big spiritual leader of India,

20:55.753 --> 20:57.468
this and that. He said,

20:57.588 --> 21:00.326
“If you want to know anything about Truth,

21:00.406 --> 21:04.872
She’ll be able to tell you”. He said, “I know all about the Truth”.

21:04.954 --> 21:07.536
So he (Dr Singh) asked me, “What do you know about this one?”

21:07.639 --> 21:11.495
I said, “His Kundalini is frozen down below there!”

21:11.700 --> 21:13.815
He was a very proud fellow, you see

21:13.934 --> 21:18.101
– “I know all about Truth!” Imagine to say that!

21:30.845 --> 21:34.428
Rustom: Should I take some vibrations from you?

21:34.618 --> 21:43.299
Lots of it left here. Nabhi, most of you have a left Nabhi….
