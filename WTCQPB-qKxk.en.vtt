SHRI HANUMANA PUJA APRIL 23, 1989

00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:12.500
MARGATE, KENT, ENGLAND

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.749
It is such a joy today

00:02:35.098 --> 00:02:38.577
and the whole atmosphere seems to be bubbling with it,

00:02:40.545 --> 00:02:43.632
as if the angels are singing.

00:02:45.356 --> 00:02:51.707
And the speciality of Hanumana was that He was an angel.

00:02:53.233 --> 00:03:00.233
Angels are born like angels. They are angels

00:03:01.024 --> 00:03:05.212
and they are not human beings.

00:03:07.158 --> 00:03:11.028
They're born with the angelic qualities.

00:03:12.088 --> 00:03:17.351
But now you all have become angels from the human beings.

00:03:17.578 --> 00:03:20.001
It's a very great achievement of Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:26.875 --> 00:03:32.462
The qualities that are born with the angels

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:36.523
are seen from their very childhood.

00:03:40.213 --> 00:03:48.988
Firstly, they are not afraid of untruth, falsehood.

00:03:52.633 --> 00:03:57.947
They're not worried as to what people will say to them,

00:03:59.155 --> 00:04:01.435
or what they will lose in life.

00:04:02.997 --> 00:04:08.447
To them truth is their life, they breathe truth

00:04:10.642 --> 00:04:13.227
and nothing else matters with them.

00:04:14.797 --> 00:04:19.612
This is the first great quality of an angel.

00:04:21.991 --> 00:04:26.930
They will go to any extent to establish truth, to protect,

00:04:27.438 --> 00:04:33.559
and to protect the people who are in truth.

00:04:37.318 --> 00:04:41.169
It's such a wide range of these angels, all over.

00:04:42.031 --> 00:04:44.473
So in the left side we have ganas,

00:04:44.508 --> 00:04:48.477
on the right side we have angels. And translated in

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:54.235
Sanskrit language or in any Indian language as devdhoot -

00:04:54.317 --> 00:04:56.892
means they are the ambassadors of God.

00:05:00.284 --> 00:05:05.383
So now you are the same, you are all angels now.

00:05:06.396 --> 00:05:09.179
Only thing, you are not aware that you are angels,

00:05:09.207 --> 00:05:11.348
while they were aware from their childhood.

00:05:14.678 --> 00:05:16.774
If you know that you are angels,

00:05:19.566 --> 00:05:22.531
all your qualities will start shining through

00:05:25.579 --> 00:05:27.755
and you'll be amazed that

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:33.347
the quality of standing by the truth

00:05:36.112 --> 00:05:42.323
at any cost is so easily managed for you,

00:05:42.527 --> 00:05:45.915
because you have been given the right,

00:05:48.672 --> 00:05:55.824
you have been given the special blessings, the special protection

00:05:57.273 --> 00:05:59.378
from the Divine that

00:05:59.766 --> 00:06:02.743
if you stand for the right and if you stand

00:06:03.125 --> 00:06:06.537
for the righteous and if you stand for the truth,

00:06:07.521 --> 00:06:12.998
all kinds of help to protect you will be given.

00:06:16.578 --> 00:06:21.589
Angels are aware of this, they're sure of it, they are certain,

00:06:21.912 --> 00:06:24.908
there's a certainty about it. But you are not.

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:32.141
You still sometimes think, "May be, may not be."

00:06:33.015 --> 00:06:39.450
Same style goes on. But believe Me, you are angels.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.930
You have all the powers, and what rights you have!

00:06:47.246 --> 00:06:51.565
Human beings cannot get over you,

00:06:54.690 --> 00:07:00.951
that's the speciality of angels, not of saints.

00:07:02.531 --> 00:07:04.329
Saint could be maneuvered.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.455
They could be tortured, they could be troubled.

00:07:10.888 --> 00:07:18.356
Incarnations may do the same. Incarnations accept it,

00:07:18.536 --> 00:07:22.964
they want to have all these penances done to them

00:07:23.478 --> 00:07:27.694
so that they create an event in their life

00:07:29.863 --> 00:07:35.604
to express themselves in a more dynamic way. If there was no Ravana,

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.933
there would have been no Ramayana;

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.767
if there was no Kamsa, there would have been no Krishna.

00:07:45.891 --> 00:07:51.063
So the incarnations take upon themselves the problems and

00:07:51.493 --> 00:07:54.330
also the fight with the evil.

00:07:55.715 --> 00:08:01.784
So it looks sometimes that we feel that they suffer, but they don't.

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:08.031
But angels are a special category,

00:08:10.799 --> 00:08:15.859
they don't take up any problems upon themselves, they just solve them.

00:08:18.681 --> 00:08:21.729
If there's a problem, it's the angels who solve,

00:08:23.229 --> 00:08:27.898
for the saints as well as for the incarnations.

00:08:28.992 --> 00:08:32.210
And they have to be told sometimes that "Don't jump in just now,

00:08:33.239 --> 00:08:37.471
we are working out on the stage now, You will jump when we'll ask you."

00:08:38.033 --> 00:08:42.045
They're ready standing at the door just to jump in.

00:08:43.626 --> 00:08:45.626
So anxious!

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:49.742
And they are fixed quantities;

00:08:50.212 --> 00:08:53.053
you can rely on them completely.

00:08:54.493 --> 00:08:58.702
For example, Shri Hanumana, as you know Him as an angel,

00:08:59.549 --> 00:09:04.917
has great capacities, great powers,

00:09:06.137 --> 00:09:08.859
and it is His right to use them

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.422
and He is very aware of it.

00:09:13.706 --> 00:09:18.671
He does everything very amusingly, uses His powers very amusingly.

00:09:19.891 --> 00:09:24.594
Like He burnt the whole of Lanka and He was laughing at it.

00:09:25.394 --> 00:09:27.512
Then He extended His tail

00:09:28.224 --> 00:09:31.248
and put it round the necks of many rakshasas

00:09:31.591 --> 00:09:34.059
and He was just playing with them and then flew in the air, and

00:09:34.061 --> 00:09:35.511
they all were dangling in the air.

00:09:37.796 --> 00:09:40.901
So it's a playfulness of the angels also

00:09:42.617 --> 00:09:44.617
because they're so confident,

00:09:46.972 --> 00:09:48.800
they're absolutely aware,

00:09:51.922 --> 00:09:56.306
absolutely identified with their personality,

00:09:57.121 --> 00:09:59.954
with their powers, with themselves.

00:10:03.148 --> 00:10:07.317
Here the Sahaja Yogis sometimes don't understand

00:10:08.492 --> 00:10:11.192
that I have made you into angels.

00:10:14.277 --> 00:10:17.766
I've not made you into saints, but angels,

00:10:19.247 --> 00:10:21.264
and you are always protected.

00:10:22.496 --> 00:10:25.247
I can only make angels, I can't make saints.

00:10:25.951 --> 00:10:28.611
Saints are made by their own effort.

00:10:29.635 --> 00:10:32.958
The effortlessness doing is like Ganesha,

00:10:33.589 --> 00:10:37.399
like Karttikeya, like Hanumana.

00:10:38.169 --> 00:10:40.968
The same way you are all made, with the same style.

00:10:44.161 --> 00:10:49.336
So try to understand

00:10:51.014 --> 00:10:55.050
that what I say about you is the truth.

00:10:57.883 --> 00:11:00.118
All kinds of conditionings work

00:11:01.156 --> 00:11:04.125
even through you people though you are saints

00:11:05.592 --> 00:11:07.991
and you don't know how to spread your wings.

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:12.993
Still, sometimes I feel that

00:11:13.488 --> 00:11:15.676
the rebirth has taken place

00:11:16.318 --> 00:11:19.415
and they have all become like angels with wings,

00:11:20.496 --> 00:11:24.355
but as little birds, they still have to learn how to fly.

00:11:26.875 --> 00:11:28.747
But you must gain your confidence

00:11:28.762 --> 00:11:31.451
by your experiences which you have in Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:32.971 --> 00:11:37.358
As you were singing yesterday, miracles, every day miracles around you.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.547
These are done by the angels

00:11:43.566 --> 00:11:46.997
and they try to convince you that "You are one of us,

00:11:49.907 --> 00:11:51.921
just join our company."

00:11:54.188 --> 00:11:57.504
So we have so many angels now sitting here,

00:11:59.658 --> 00:12:05.034
and why should not we think of transforming this world?

00:12:09.174 --> 00:12:10.974
And there's one more thing

00:12:11.797 --> 00:12:15.037
that you have other than the angels,

00:12:15.814 --> 00:12:18.317
because angels do not raise the Kundalini,

00:12:21.707 --> 00:12:25.544
they cannot, they're not bothered about it.

00:12:25.674 --> 00:12:32.250
They are there to kill, to burn, to suppress,

00:12:33.216 --> 00:12:36.832
to remove all the evil people around you.

00:12:38.368 --> 00:12:42.950
But they cannot transform, angels cannot transform.

00:12:44.602 --> 00:12:49.581
So you have a greater right than they have in the realm of God,

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:53.102
that you can raise the Kundalini of people

00:12:53.438 --> 00:12:55.493
and you can give Realization.

00:12:56.742 --> 00:12:59.562
But human conditionings are still sticking on.

00:13:00.625 --> 00:13:05.234
For example, I wore a ring the other day,

00:13:06.504 --> 00:13:09.175
and then My daughter starting teasing Me that

00:13:09.235 --> 00:13:12.103
"Now you must only show this finger all the time

00:13:12.121 --> 00:13:14.176
to people so that they see Your ring."

00:13:16.908 --> 00:13:20.489
So in the mundane human life, whatever we have --

00:13:20.729 --> 00:13:23.452
possessions maybe, powers you see -

00:13:23.868 --> 00:13:27.561
for example, somebody is a man with some position,

00:13:27.591 --> 00:13:29.930
immediately you can make it out with his

00:13:30.384 --> 00:13:33.238
nose and lips, the way they are turned upward.

00:13:38.205 --> 00:13:46.711
But the powers that you have in your possession,

00:13:50.133 --> 00:13:59.722
you're afraid to manifest them and to talk about it, to use them.

00:14:00.147 --> 00:14:02.771
Imagine, with so many angels

00:14:04.621 --> 00:14:07.259
the whole of England should get Realization in no time,

00:14:10.507 --> 00:14:17.945
but we are still trying to learn what we are.

00:14:19.195 --> 00:14:21.195
Hanumana had no problem

00:14:23.966 --> 00:14:28.322
because from His childhood He knew that He was an angel and

00:14:28.596 --> 00:14:31.422
He has to do the job of an angel.

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:36.397
But because we were born as human beings and now we have become angels,

00:14:38.241 --> 00:14:42.131
we find it difficult to be dynamic like other angels that they were.

00:14:44.067 --> 00:14:46.751
Even your thought, collective thought,

00:14:47.161 --> 00:14:51.001
even your individual thought, is powerful,

00:14:52.301 --> 00:14:54.301
and your attention is powerful.

00:14:56.606 --> 00:15:02.057
Because of this fear, or maybe the conditionings as you can call it,

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:06.160
or maybe the ego part which is still sticking onto you,

00:15:11.502 --> 00:15:18.896
you still hang around false things,

00:15:21.488 --> 00:15:29.050
and that force, that dynamism is not expressed.

00:15:29.737 --> 00:15:34.699
We can blame anything, like we can blame lethargy to some country,

00:15:35.606 --> 00:15:42.606
ego to some country, but now you have lost your countries completely,

00:15:43.162 --> 00:15:46.978
now you have entered into the Kingdom of God.

00:15:48.358 --> 00:15:54.425
You're in a country which has no bounds, which has no limitations.

00:15:56.307 --> 00:16:01.279
And then, all these conditionings that are still lingering in you

00:16:02.465 --> 00:16:06.532
shouldn't bother you at all, and shouldn't

00:16:07.222 --> 00:16:13.146
upset you or deter you from doing whatever is your job.

00:16:14.914 --> 00:16:20.908
Now imagine, Hanumana as Gabriel had to go

00:16:21.469 --> 00:16:29.988
and tell Maria that "There's a Child which is the Incarnation.

00:16:31.953 --> 00:16:39.277
The Savior is going to be born to You." She was a young virgin.

00:16:40.092 --> 00:16:44.063
To break such a news which was horrible compared to

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:47.750
the conditionings of those days.

00:16:49.345 --> 00:16:50.885
He did it -

00:16:51.188 --> 00:16:52.845
"I have to do it so I'll do it;

00:16:54.162 --> 00:16:56.162
if that's the order, I'll do it" -

00:16:58.086 --> 00:17:01.969
because He knew that the carrying out of the order

00:17:03.354 --> 00:17:09.015
is His nature, is built within Him

00:17:10.141 --> 00:17:12.368
and He'snot going to doubt it.

00:17:14.211 --> 00:17:19.258
He's not going to wait, but just told and He does it.

00:17:23.242 --> 00:17:26.590
So a great understanding has to be within us,

00:17:27.394 --> 00:17:29.772
that we are growing within ourselves.

00:17:30.157 --> 00:17:32.157
But if we do not manifest,

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:34.560
if we do not show our qualities,

00:17:35.567 --> 00:17:38.709
and if we do not express it in our life,

00:17:39.656 --> 00:17:44.198
in our doing, in our object, in the meaning of our life,

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:47.750
then Sahaja Yoga is not going to spread.

00:17:48.303 --> 00:17:50.303
Nor is it going to help you much.

00:17:56.585 --> 00:18:04.845
The kind of work you have to do has no problems with it.

00:18:08.335 --> 00:18:10.335
I have problems, not you.

00:18:12.244 --> 00:18:13.732
You don't have to face problems.

00:18:13.757 --> 00:18:15.959
You go and talk to anyone, whatever you feel like.

00:18:18.534 --> 00:18:21.523
They will jolly well have to listen to you, I should say.

00:18:21.874 --> 00:18:23.982
But if they don't, they can't harm you.

00:18:24.852 --> 00:18:26.852
They can't do any harm to you.

00:18:30.667 --> 00:18:35.745
This is a very great protection you have, they cannot hinder your work.

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:43.837
Coming to Sahaja Yoga is not what we have gained,

00:18:45.384 --> 00:18:46.817
what we have got.

00:18:47.759 --> 00:18:50.914
See the people who say, "We've done so much for Sahaj Yoga

00:18:52.155 --> 00:18:53.704
and what Sahaja Yoga has given us?"

00:18:53.778 --> 00:18:55.559
It has given you Self Realization.

00:18:55.804 --> 00:18:58.747
It has given you the angel status.

00:19:00.821 --> 00:19:02.793
I mean you try anything else,

00:19:03.531 --> 00:19:08.814
can you get the status of an angel? You cannot.

00:19:10.292 --> 00:19:12.611
Sahaja Yoga has given you that status,

00:19:13.438 --> 00:19:15.820
so what more do you want?

00:19:17.586 --> 00:19:19.604
It was never possible before,

00:19:21.443 --> 00:19:24.278
believe Me, impossible situation.

00:19:24.957 --> 00:19:28.439
If it was possible in any way, then

00:19:29.205 --> 00:19:32.881
Gyaneshwara would not have taken His samadhi at such a young age,

00:19:34.681 --> 00:19:39.640
and Kabira would not have said, "Oh God, what am I to do?

00:19:39.773 --> 00:19:41.773
This world is blind."

00:19:46.362 --> 00:19:51.275
So you have that subtle power within you

00:19:51.317 --> 00:19:54.770
that you can work out on people's Kundalini without even

00:19:54.882 --> 00:19:56.268
they knowing about it.

00:20:02.935 --> 00:20:05.386
But in meditation when you sit down,

00:20:06.523 --> 00:20:09.124
you must admit to yourself, "I'm an angel,

00:20:12.002 --> 00:20:14.002
and as being an angel,

00:20:15.176 --> 00:20:20.491
I have no attachments with anything else but with God's work."

00:20:20.919 --> 00:20:26.027
Attachments are so many still in Sahaja Yoga I've seen people have,

00:20:28.745 --> 00:20:33.368
like attachments to, now because they're married,

00:20:33.796 --> 00:20:35.970
so they have attached to wives,

00:20:37.152 --> 00:20:40.626
and so many have fallen out because of their wives attachments.

00:20:41.102 --> 00:20:43.469
Then they have attachments to their children,

00:20:44.161 --> 00:20:47.718
and so many will fall out if they have attachments to their children.

00:20:48.115 --> 00:20:49.906
As I told you yesterday

00:20:50.175 --> 00:20:52.324
that all the children of the world

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.379
who are Sahaja Yogis are your children.

00:20:55.477 --> 00:20:57.328
You're the parents of all the children;

00:20:58.468 --> 00:21:02.756
it's not that if your child is sleeping you cover that child.

00:21:02.836 --> 00:21:04.562
No, you cover all the children.

00:21:05.116 --> 00:21:08.172
You have to look after all the children which are lying down.

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:12.136
Can you think of Hanumana, if He was here

00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:15.004
and when the children were sleeping It would just

00:21:15.043 --> 00:21:17.732
cover the body of one child?

00:21:18.702 --> 00:21:20.702
Because He's a universal being.

00:21:25.199 --> 00:21:29.930
So every child has to be loved the same way, cared for by you.

00:21:33.031 --> 00:21:43.015
Then there are other attachments like possessions, positions, jobs.

00:21:45.551 --> 00:21:48.218
I have none so I don't know what others are,

00:21:53.878 --> 00:21:58.026
except for when I see you

00:21:58.925 --> 00:22:02.089
so much lovingly coming to the station,

00:22:03.399 --> 00:22:07.226
then the whole heart becomes like an ocean, I think, and just

00:22:07.535 --> 00:22:14.371
starts like a big swell of a tide, like that and I see that.

00:22:14.983 --> 00:22:19.042
And then when I have to leave you, again it recedes back like a sea

00:22:19.736 --> 00:22:21.736
which is now receding.

00:22:22.788 --> 00:22:25.182
It's something like, you see the moon

00:22:25.781 --> 00:22:31.511
and the sea starts reacting to the beauty of the moon,

00:22:31.542 --> 00:22:34.221
the joy of the moon, the love of the moon.

00:22:35.388 --> 00:22:42.388
Then I see the love, the love that is you see in a nest

00:22:42.978 --> 00:22:46.608
where a bird is feeding its young ones.

00:22:47.033 --> 00:22:49.839
And you see this love in the sky,

00:22:50.276 --> 00:22:52.757
then you see this love in your heart,

00:22:54.690 --> 00:23:00.498
and only thing that you can describe is the feeling

00:23:00.891 --> 00:23:07.645
of tremendous ocean of joy within you, just flowing out.

00:23:14.262 --> 00:23:23.163
The attachments do not give you capacity to enjoy that ocean.

00:23:23.801 --> 00:23:25.964
If you are standing on the shore,

00:23:26.571 --> 00:23:30.182
how will you enjoy the ocean? You have to jump into it.

00:23:30.965 --> 00:23:37.347
But you've got your anchorage onto different things, so you can't jump in.

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:42.642
And you are so safe.

00:23:43.033 --> 00:23:47.510
You know how to swim, you know how to kill a shark,

00:23:48.445 --> 00:23:51.836
even one sight of yours is sufficient.

00:23:52.699 --> 00:23:55.928
But because you're not aware, it is not acting.

00:23:56.215 --> 00:23:57.812
Absolutely this is the case.

00:24:02.592 --> 00:24:03.990
I've seen people

00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:07.739
who get small positions in life and they start boasting about it,

00:24:09.136 --> 00:24:11.322
"I met this-and-this man, I met

00:24:11.353 --> 00:24:14.495
that-and-that man, and this happened and that happened."

00:24:15.055 --> 00:24:17.619
You feel like laughing at the person I mean.

00:24:18.842 --> 00:24:21.543
But you have met Sahaja Yoga,

00:24:21.786 --> 00:24:24.593
by which you have grown, you have been nourished,

00:24:25.024 --> 00:24:26.539
you have become so great.

00:24:30.407 --> 00:24:37.974
With all this we have to follow the line of Hanumana.

00:24:41.947 --> 00:24:44.764
He thought the sun is very egoistical,

00:24:46.125 --> 00:24:50.382
trying to burn people. Sometimes there's too much heat,

00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:55.181
and the sun worshippers also are egoistical.

00:24:57.266 --> 00:24:59.266
They have so much ego in them.

00:25:01.301 --> 00:25:08.951
Any word if you say wrong in their language,

00:25:09.565 --> 00:25:12.678
or in their customs, say you hold

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:15.914
the fork in the wrong hand -- finished!

00:25:16.755 --> 00:25:18.879
You are the worst person in the whole world,

00:25:19.389 --> 00:25:21.389
committed the greatest sin.

00:25:23.263 --> 00:25:31.568
All such small, stupid ideas come out of a very depraved ego.

00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:35.490
Ego is so depraved

00:25:36.752 --> 00:25:39.086
when you start thinking no end of yourself -

00:25:40.416 --> 00:25:42.416
that "I'm everything

00:25:44.047 --> 00:25:46.047
and I know everything,"

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:50.454
and "this custom is the best," or "that carpet is the best." "I, I,

00:25:50.877 --> 00:25:53.242
I don't like." Well, who are you?

00:25:54.552 --> 00:25:56.937
Who asked you to like it or not to like it?

00:25:59.581 --> 00:26:02.472
"I don't like this, I don't like that."

00:26:03.038 --> 00:26:07.951
On the other side, the egoists always becomes slaves also.

00:26:11.394 --> 00:26:16.644
I must say that after going through the countries

00:26:18.169 --> 00:26:23.366
which are following certain norms,

00:26:23.809 --> 00:26:26.265
which are dictations of the ego.

00:26:27.617 --> 00:26:29.617
Like an artist, now for example.

00:26:30.015 --> 00:26:32.706
An artist produces something for his joy,

00:26:33.259 --> 00:26:37.354
but he must be criticized by everyone.

00:26:38.917 --> 00:26:40.535
The criticism should be,

00:26:40.676 --> 00:26:43.789
"I don't like this, this color is no good, that is not."

00:26:43.819 --> 00:26:45.819
And you have professionals who do this.

00:26:47.895 --> 00:26:51.556
They don't know how to even draw one pencil line properly

00:26:53.759 --> 00:26:55.759
leave alone painting anything,

00:26:56.265 --> 00:27:00.271
but immediately they'll say, "I think this, this is ...you see."'

00:27:00.516 --> 00:27:03.300
They have made books out of it,

00:27:06.373 --> 00:27:08.709
theses and theories.

00:27:09.809 --> 00:27:10.435
I mean,

00:27:11.685 --> 00:27:15.089
art has something to do with your heart and not with your brain.

00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:19.789
That's how you have killed so many artists.

00:27:21.205 --> 00:27:24.600
And everybody who is painting has to think

00:27:24.765 --> 00:27:27.420
what people will say about this.

00:27:28.329 --> 00:27:32.852
But as a result of that, something absolutely absurd,

00:27:34.133 --> 00:27:35.305
gross,

00:27:38.031 --> 00:27:43.434
without any subtle expression, is today appreciated.

00:27:46.654 --> 00:27:48.695
This is because of our ego

00:27:49.001 --> 00:27:53.357
which has suppressed every proper, spontaneous,

00:27:53.423 --> 00:28:00.500
living growth of our thought, of our art and of our life.

00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:07.174
I think it's worse than all the contamination we talk about

00:28:07.369 --> 00:28:08.895
or ecological problems.

00:28:08.907 --> 00:28:12.737
It's the human mind which has produced these

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:18.453
suffocating areas where nobody can express anything,

00:28:24.005 --> 00:28:27.138
and the one who has a greater ego dominates.

00:28:27.417 --> 00:28:29.787
"This book has been written by such-and-such person."

00:28:29.829 --> 00:28:32.237
You meet that person, you feel like jumping in the sea.

00:28:35.871 --> 00:28:38.490
So everything written is not a bible,

00:28:39.122 --> 00:28:41.965
and those mostly who write are people

00:28:43.149 --> 00:28:46.533
whom you should never meet without a bargepole.

00:28:50.695 --> 00:28:55.691
So anything that is expressed, you see, say in a dress or

00:28:56.207 --> 00:28:58.008
in relationship with your children,

00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:01.516
in relationship with your teacher, in relationship with anyone,

00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:05.206
has to be so and so and so.

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:09.620
You must say "thank you" many a times;

00:29:10.541 --> 00:29:12.541
you must say "sorry" many a times.

00:29:13.741 --> 00:29:17.426
So we are so much curbed into artificial expressions

00:29:17.766 --> 00:29:21.070
that I think after some time there will be no art produced.

00:29:22.388 --> 00:29:24.388
There's no exuberance.

00:29:24.771 --> 00:29:26.414
They cannot, they're afraid.

00:29:28.956 --> 00:29:30.956
I don't know if you have noticed this or not,

00:29:32.735 --> 00:29:39.018
but those who go to see any museum, or go to see any exhibition,

00:29:39.081 --> 00:29:43.760
anything, think, all of them, to be great,

00:29:44.006 --> 00:29:51.876
some divine personalities that they can judge everyone.

00:29:53.835 --> 00:29:57.097
Through the Agnya that we judge,

00:29:57.702 --> 00:30:01.127
that is what Hanumana wanted to eat once for all.

00:30:03.304 --> 00:30:06.692
There's the movement of the Agnya which goes right and left, you see,

00:30:07.836 --> 00:30:09.485
which makes us

00:30:10.137 --> 00:30:14.326
express our so-called, nonsensical personality of a ego.

00:30:15.346 --> 00:30:19.292
It's the one that He tried to control and eat it off.

00:30:19.910 --> 00:30:23.339
As I eat bhoots, perhaps He was eating this sun.

00:30:24.321 --> 00:30:32.348
But for an angel it is important to know that

00:30:33.508 --> 00:30:35.508
there is no ego within you.

00:30:39.004 --> 00:30:41.004
There are some Sahaja yogis

00:30:42.317 --> 00:30:45.374
who say, "Mother, I didn't want to do too much of

00:30:45.701 --> 00:30:48.524
Sahaja Yoga work because my ego will come up."

00:30:50.397 --> 00:30:54.238
Many. "I don't want my ego to express it."

00:30:54.789 --> 00:30:58.964
But why do you want your ego to be destroyed, for what?

00:30:59.353 --> 00:31:00.911
For Sahaja Yoga work isn't it?

00:31:02.791 --> 00:31:10.608
What a vicious circle it is that we say that we want to

00:31:12.846 --> 00:31:20.909
keep ourselves in the background because our ego should not develop.

00:31:21.119 --> 00:31:23.119
You are just thinking about yourself.

00:31:25.802 --> 00:31:27.531
What about Sahaja Yoga?

00:31:28.258 --> 00:31:32.356
So nowadays the trend is, "Oh, better be on the safe side."

00:31:33.312 --> 00:31:39.056
Because they have seen some people who were very egoistical,

00:31:39.501 --> 00:31:44.356
who were very dashing about Sahaja Yoga,

00:31:44.475 --> 00:31:50.923
who tried to show off -- had to fall.

00:31:53.498 --> 00:31:57.695
So another trend has started, I feel, in Sahaja Yoga that

00:31:57.869 --> 00:31:59.869
"Better be on the safe side," you see.

00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:07.173
Between these two, Sahaja Yoga will be lost.

00:32:10.054 --> 00:32:14.966
So if you know you are angels, you'll have no ego.

00:32:18.292 --> 00:32:22.251
Anybody who knows that it's his nature to do something.

00:32:23.325 --> 00:32:27.974
Like today My husband was praising Me saying that

00:32:28.014 --> 00:32:31.054
"It is You Who has done it." I said, "Not Me. It's not Me."

00:32:31.868 --> 00:32:33.451
He said, "How do You say it is not You?"

00:32:33.458 --> 00:32:36.556
"Because," I said, "It is innately built in them.

00:32:36.752 --> 00:32:42.628
A seed, if it is planted in the Mother Earth, then it sprouts.

00:32:43.003 --> 00:32:45.469
In the same way, they have innately built within them

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:47.254
their Kundalinis It sprouts.

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:49.228
So how is it I have done?"

00:32:49.306 --> 00:32:52.495
"But," he said. "But the Mother Earth has done it."

00:32:52.596 --> 00:32:53.559
I said, "No,

00:32:54.494 --> 00:32:57.667
it's the quality in Mother Earth which is built in, has done it."

00:33:02.422 --> 00:33:05.374
So he said, "Then who has done all this?"

00:33:16.305 --> 00:33:19.219
So I said, "It's done by Adi Shakti, agreed.

00:33:22.519 --> 00:33:27.238
But, Sahaja Yoga is not done by Adi Shakti.

00:33:28.459 --> 00:33:32.234
She has created these powers in everyone which works out,

00:33:32.854 --> 00:33:34.659
but Sahaja Yoga is not.

00:33:35.539 --> 00:33:39.481
Sahaja Yoga works through the innate qualities

00:33:40.911 --> 00:33:43.864
that are in the Mother Earth and that are in the seed.

00:33:46.968 --> 00:33:53.164
So I'm here as... not as Adi Shakti.

00:33:53.716 --> 00:33:58.262
I'm here as their Mother, as their Holy Mother,

00:33:59.415 --> 00:34:02.996
and as Holy Mother I've guided them."

00:34:03.198 --> 00:34:11.002
You can say I'm like the Mother Earth  who sprouts the seeds.

00:34:13.930 --> 00:34:19.555
So then another detachment can come in, into you,

00:34:20.412 --> 00:34:25.750
that these are your powers within you which have been

00:34:26.432 --> 00:34:30.880
just enlightened by your innate nature of Kundalini.

00:34:33.001 --> 00:34:37.688
And that you are empowered, yourself.

00:34:44.226 --> 00:34:48.387
And all this power that is within you

00:34:52.028 --> 00:34:56.475
is only told by Me that it is within you. You see for yourself.

00:34:56.488 --> 00:34:58.091
Only like a mirror I'm telling you,

00:34:58.108 --> 00:35:00.284
"You are this, see for yourself."

00:35:01.054 --> 00:35:03.114
So how can I take any credit for it?

00:35:04.585 --> 00:35:08.420
So you can even have detachment to understand that

00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:14.295
the powers that we have is for Sahaja Yoga.

00:35:14.444 --> 00:35:19.307
As Mother has powers to work for Sahaja Yoga,

00:35:19.911 --> 00:35:22.897
we too have powers to work for Sahaja Yoga.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.769
And as She works, we also have to work.

00:35:29.501 --> 00:35:32.757
But there is attachment like this,

00:35:32.995 --> 00:35:35.590
"Mother is doing everything, what can we do?"

00:35:36.569 --> 00:35:39.282
No! You have to do it.

00:35:40.856 --> 00:35:44.227
This is a very important detachment, which I'm trying to say

00:35:44.872 --> 00:35:48.535
that you have to do this yourself.

00:35:49.503 --> 00:35:51.503
It's not that Mother will do.

00:35:52.239 --> 00:35:54.149
"After all, Mother is doing everything."

00:35:54.626 --> 00:35:57.095
It's correct, that is correct in a way,

00:35:57.517 --> 00:35:58.915
but you are the instrument.

00:35:58.958 --> 00:36:02.350
Electricity is doing everything here but this instrument has to work.

00:36:05.648 --> 00:36:07.648
So the source may be there but

00:36:07.721 --> 00:36:10.918
the instrument is the one which delivers the goods.

00:36:11.484 --> 00:36:15.163
And like Hanumana, you are the instrument

00:36:17.126 --> 00:36:20.907
and you have to work, you have to do the job.

00:36:21.593 --> 00:36:24.347
It's in a very dynamic we should achieve.

00:36:25.824 --> 00:36:28.696
Another great quality of Hanumana was that

00:36:29.996 --> 00:36:31.996
He was very alert

00:36:33.123 --> 00:36:35.921
and that He was beyond time.

00:36:36.893 --> 00:36:41.037
When you eat off the sun, where is the time?

00:36:42.586 --> 00:36:43.592
He was beyond time.

00:36:44.309 --> 00:36:51.272
Because of that, everything He did very fast.

00:36:53.177 --> 00:36:55.926
For example, now we are preparing say

00:36:56.451 --> 00:36:57.567
a book of Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:57.962 --> 00:37:01.608
For the last sixteen years it's going on.

00:37:01.619 --> 00:37:04.145
"It's working out, Mother, working out."

00:37:07.210 --> 00:37:14.369
Then we are trying to make some arrangements about having

00:37:14.874 --> 00:37:20.781
the recording of the sick people and being cured with Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:20.818 --> 00:37:24.143
"That's happening, very good, happening, happening."

00:37:26.841 --> 00:37:33.146
Then we are going to go to Russia to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:33.264 --> 00:37:34.184
"Ah, working out."

00:37:37.536 --> 00:37:41.570
All the devils have reached there, but the angels are still working it out,

00:37:41.689 --> 00:37:47.089
very patient, very patient angels.

00:37:49.883 --> 00:37:55.453
So one of the qualities of Shri Hanumana was that

00:37:55.872 --> 00:37:57.849
He was a fast person.

00:37:58.651 --> 00:38:01.654
He would do the work before anybody could do it.

00:38:02.065 --> 00:38:04.065
He was out beat.

00:38:04.610 --> 00:38:10.796
It's all right to fight in Trafalgar and win and defeat Napolean,

00:38:12.541 --> 00:38:19.503
but in the field of dharma and the field of Sahaja Yoga,

00:38:19.517 --> 00:38:22.639
I find people don't understand the importance of time.

00:38:25.001 --> 00:38:30.157
We are delayed masters, and dilatory habits we have.

00:38:30.617 --> 00:38:34.346
"All right, I'll telephone. I'll find out and it will happen."

00:38:36.301 --> 00:38:38.493
This is one of the greatest defects

00:38:39.277 --> 00:38:42.216
we have which we have to learn from Hanumana,

00:38:42.928 --> 00:38:45.446
that Rama wanted to send word,

00:38:47.712 --> 00:38:50.700
so He sent His ring with Hanumana.

00:38:50.991 --> 00:38:52.833
Rama could not do that fast,

00:38:55.691 --> 00:38:57.365
so Hanumana went and did it.

00:38:57.954 --> 00:39:04.149
Then Rama wanted to have this sanjivani, this kind of a herb.

00:39:05.428 --> 00:39:11.796
So He sent Him to get from particular mountain.

00:39:13.149 --> 00:39:15.163
He said, "Now why to waste time finding it out?

00:39:15.168 --> 00:39:16.227
Better take the whole thing."

00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:21.340
So He carried the whole mountain there.

00:39:23.654 --> 00:39:28.119
"Better do it quickly, immediately, this is the time to do it."

00:39:29.318 --> 00:39:33.144
But, "Next year we'll see. Mother, You know, after Ganapatipule,

00:39:33.153 --> 00:39:34.652
we can consider.

00:39:35.393 --> 00:39:37.035
We'll have discussions,

00:39:37.052 --> 00:39:39.735
and then we'll have arguments," and this and that.

00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:46.083
This is one thing about His character one has to know,

00:39:46.925 --> 00:39:50.401
that today, when we are worshipping Hanumana,

00:39:51.448 --> 00:39:55.490
we should have that quick-wittedness within us.

00:39:56.783 --> 00:39:58.783
It is to be done now.

00:40:01.815 --> 00:40:03.637
We cannot postpone it anymore.

00:40:04.424 --> 00:40:06.053
Already we are very much delayed.

00:40:06.371 --> 00:40:08.632
I saw the girls who were wearing frocks,

00:40:08.636 --> 00:40:12.142
small little things have grown into big girls now, about to be married.

00:40:12.852 --> 00:40:15.731
So I think all My life I'll be marrying only Sahaja Yogis.

00:40:18.446 --> 00:40:23.451
To see the results you have to become quick people.

00:40:24.574 --> 00:40:27.894
Not to linger and be satisfied with other things.

00:40:28.955 --> 00:40:30.955
But positive things, what are we doing?

00:40:32.498 --> 00:40:35.145
For example, it's nice, children have grown up,

00:40:35.513 --> 00:40:37.260
they had such a nice drama,

00:40:37.309 --> 00:40:39.234
play, all that I enjoyed very much.

00:40:39.266 --> 00:40:41.266
It was very good for everybody's enjoyment,

00:40:42.861 --> 00:40:46.616
but job is there, we have to do. We have to do the job.

00:40:48.034 --> 00:40:50.034
So attention should be on the job,

00:40:51.432 --> 00:40:53.710
and that's what, what are we doing about it?

00:40:56.468 --> 00:41:00.447
I was happy that a suggestion has come from America about

00:41:00.807 --> 00:41:02.807
making a video film and things like that.

00:41:04.465 --> 00:41:06.465
And then there are obstructions:

00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:08.976
"How are we going to get money, what is going to happen?"

00:41:09.009 --> 00:41:11.009
You just start it, you'll get it.

00:41:12.406 --> 00:41:13.837
You have powers.

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:21.328
Everything will be synchronized properly, you just start doing it.

00:41:21.631 --> 00:41:24.560
But if you behave like human beings - first think

00:41:24.810 --> 00:41:27.356
then plan it out, and then cancel it -

00:41:32.697 --> 00:41:34.241
it's not going to work out.

00:41:36.754 --> 00:41:40.582
Though Hanumana is running on the Pingala Nadi all the time,

00:41:40.809 --> 00:41:44.171
what He does is to spoil our plans

00:41:46.182 --> 00:41:49.489
because, instead of Him, we run on the Pingala.

00:41:49.609 --> 00:41:52.172
So He says, "All right, you running it? I'll put you right!"

00:41:52.333 --> 00:41:55.770
So He sidetracks all our plans all the time.

00:41:56.065 --> 00:41:58.065
That's how all our planning fails.

00:42:02.541 --> 00:42:08.576
We are particular about timing, about things of no importance,

00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:16.296
but we are not particular about timings of our progress in Sahaja Yoga.

00:42:18.153 --> 00:42:21.733
We must have targets, we must have fixed times,

00:42:21.815 --> 00:42:23.571
"All right, by this time we have to achieve,"

00:42:23.996 --> 00:42:25.933
but do it little faster is better.

00:42:29.073 --> 00:42:31.845
All other things can be managed, but this is your job,

00:42:31.905 --> 00:42:33.326
nobody's going to do it.

00:42:36.094 --> 00:42:38.264
Nobody's going to do it, it's your job.

00:42:39.704 --> 00:42:42.096
I mean you are not going to run the train,

00:42:43.505 --> 00:42:45.505
you are not going to run aeroplanes

00:42:47.538 --> 00:42:51.202
and you don't have to run any administration and this stupid politics,

00:42:52.283 --> 00:42:54.283
but you have to do Sahaja Yoga.

00:42:55.662 --> 00:42:58.207
You have to spread it; you have to bring it

00:42:58.581 --> 00:43:01.590
to a level where people can see it.

00:43:02.661 --> 00:43:06.428
Now eighteen years have passed, this is the nineteenth year.

00:43:08.854 --> 00:43:17.077
So today is the first day of Hanumana's Puja.

00:43:17.653 --> 00:43:20.062
I must say you have to venture.

00:43:23.330 --> 00:43:30.924
You have to venture without any fear, collectively and individually,

00:43:32.063 --> 00:43:33.846
forgetting as to what will happen.

00:43:33.922 --> 00:43:35.922
I mean you won't go to jails,

00:43:36.505 --> 00:43:39.159
you will not be crucified, be sure on that.

00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:44.821
I mean if you lose your job, you can get another,

00:43:45.201 --> 00:43:49.248
and if you don't get a job, you can get a dole all right.

00:43:54.627 --> 00:43:57.595
So you don't have to worry about all

00:43:58.254 --> 00:44:01.033
useless things which human beings sit down and worry;

00:44:01.042 --> 00:44:03.389
but despite that they achieve work,

00:44:05.241 --> 00:44:06.521
they do their jobs,

00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:12.159
and how much they're wedded to it I'm surprised.

00:44:12.494 --> 00:44:14.221
I've seen it in My family

00:44:14.667 --> 00:44:16.690
how much they're wedded. They have to do this work,

00:44:16.828 --> 00:44:19.245
they have to get up in the morning, do this, do that.

00:44:19.981 --> 00:44:22.733
But you are not aware that you are angels and this is your work.

00:44:22.764 --> 00:44:26.631
You have to do this and nothing else is important.

00:44:29.517 --> 00:44:33.235
I hope by today's puja, that enthusiasm,

00:44:33.384 --> 00:44:35.384
that venturesome nature

00:44:36.468 --> 00:44:39.136
will vibrate your Pingala,

00:44:40.968 --> 00:44:44.219
and without feeling any ego about it,

00:44:44.424 --> 00:44:48.128
in the most humble manner as Hanumana was,

00:44:48.714 --> 00:44:50.714
you will do the jobs.

00:44:51.299 --> 00:44:57.863
Hanumana, imagine, He was given a beautiful necklace of gold

00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:06.183
with big, big balls for Him to wear by Sita.

00:45:06.476 --> 00:45:10.837
And He opened all of them one by one.

00:45:10.859 --> 00:45:13.926
He said, "There is no Rama in this, what will I do with this gold?"

00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:17.900
So She said, "Where is Rama?"

00:45:18.153 --> 00:45:23.257
He opened His heart and showed it, "See, Rama is here."

00:45:26.055 --> 00:45:28.992
If Rama is there you cannot have ego.

00:45:31.163 --> 00:45:35.021
So, so much of dynamism and so much of humility --

00:45:37.943 --> 00:45:39.619
what a combination it was!

00:45:40.924 --> 00:45:45.550
And that's what you have to just manifest.

00:45:45.999 --> 00:45:50.405
The more you'll work, the more you'll assert yourself,

00:45:51.768 --> 00:45:55.801
you will find that humility is the only thing that helps.

00:45:59.050 --> 00:46:02.861
Obedience is the only thing that helps  to carry out your work

00:46:03.085 --> 00:46:04.912
and you'll become humbler and humbler.

00:46:05.165 --> 00:46:08.303
But if you think, "Oh I am doing this," then finished.

00:46:09.297 --> 00:46:11.741
But if you know that it's done by the Divine,

00:46:12.246 --> 00:46:15.332
"Paramchaitanya is doing everything, I am just an instrument,"

00:46:15.708 --> 00:46:18.570
the humility will be there and you will be an effective instrument.

00:46:18.915 --> 00:46:22.544
I hope in this country today,

00:46:22.556 --> 00:46:25.191
it was very necessary and it was so timely.

00:46:25.739 --> 00:46:29.127
It was all organized by angels that we should have this puja here.

00:46:29.464 --> 00:46:31.245
But it's good for all of you.

00:46:32.090 --> 00:46:35.482
You have to really go and see the media people,

00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:41.074
go and see these ministers, go and see, say, Prince of Wales.

00:46:41.092 --> 00:46:44.443
Go and see another person, meet them, make committees,

00:46:44.534 --> 00:46:46.481
see what you can do.

00:46:46.668 --> 00:46:48.547
Put your mind to it, "What are we to do?"

00:46:49.169 --> 00:46:52.200
But here only, "My mother is sick, my child is sick,

00:46:52.234 --> 00:46:57.055
my this thing is sick, my friend is sick my ...," still going on with it.

00:46:58.589 --> 00:47:02.314
If you start doing God's work, your worries are taken over.

00:47:02.327 --> 00:47:05.566
You don't have to worry about anything, just taken over.

00:47:08.016 --> 00:47:10.427
But it's not self-propagation, it's not!

00:47:11.392 --> 00:47:13.791
It's the propagation of the collective.

00:47:14.903 --> 00:47:18.698
I hope today you have understood the subtle side of your being

00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:22.846
which is there, which is exhibiting, which I can see clearly,

00:47:23.222 --> 00:47:26.531
and that you will, all of you will

00:47:27.823 --> 00:47:31.663
in your meditation become aware of what you have within yourself.

00:47:33.485 --> 00:47:34.868
That's the greatest thing

00:47:35.576 --> 00:47:39.597
that will please the Divine, and Divine will look after you fully

00:47:41.179 --> 00:47:43.599
with the same confidence as the angels.

00:47:44.267 --> 00:47:50.403
Like Hanumana you have to go further and work it out.

00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:54.490
May God bless you all.

00:48:11.145 --> 00:48:14.511
I have to say about the ego part is this,

00:48:15.172 --> 00:48:19.051
which is really the problem in the West, why people have so much ego

00:48:19.262 --> 00:48:22.243
than Indian people have.

00:48:23.347 --> 00:48:25.258
One of the things is that

00:48:25.736 --> 00:48:30.484
the right side, as I've told you many-a-times, is like an accelerator.

00:48:30.655 --> 00:48:33.166
The left side is like the brake.

00:48:33.970 --> 00:48:39.081
So if the Mooladhara is not in control, if the brake is not all right,

00:48:39.708 --> 00:48:42.825
naturally that accelerator cannot be controlled.

00:48:45.601 --> 00:48:49.179
So basically our Mooladhara should be brought round

00:48:50.436 --> 00:48:52.129
and must be put right.

00:48:52.676 --> 00:48:56.829
You should work very hard to do that. If your brake is established,

00:48:57.094 --> 00:48:59.282
then whatever work you do for Sahaja Yoga,

00:48:59.474 --> 00:49:02.119
you'll not get into ego practices

00:49:03.032 --> 00:49:07.265
and ego cannot anymore control you.

00:49:08.029 --> 00:49:11.345
So that is very important, specially in the West where

00:49:11.459 --> 00:49:18.890
it's being really, dangerously destroyed, the idea of auspiciousness

00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:21.400
and of holiness.

00:49:22.206 --> 00:49:25.478
So that is the power of any angel

00:49:25.889 --> 00:49:28.889
and that has to be fully established within us,

00:49:29.447 --> 00:49:32.763
and then on that power will work out,

00:49:33.907 --> 00:49:40.907
which gives you discretion, which gives you egolessness.

00:49:41.865 --> 00:49:47.255
I hope today both these things will work out within us in such a manner

00:49:47.503 --> 00:49:52.703
that we really become absolutely self-confident,

00:49:54.062 --> 00:49:59.425
realized souls whom I call as angels of modern times.
