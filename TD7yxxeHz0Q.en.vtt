Tad Nishkala
by Shrī Ādi Shaṅkarāchārya

00:00:12.265 --> 00:00:19.392
There’s a beautiful saying of Adi
Shankaracharya, Tad Nishkala,

00:00:21.554 --> 00:00:25.702
about Brahma Tattwa. I’m that
Brahma.

00:00:25.903 --> 00:00:29.492
On that. If you have? Let Me see.

00:00:29.693 --> 00:00:34.585
That’s the best way to understand
what you are.

00:00:36.965 --> 00:00:41.265
Just bring it. It’s very famous.
Have you got it?

00:00:41.426 --> 00:00:45.874
Yogi: Dakshina Murti?
Shri Mataji: No, not that, another one.

00:00:48.535 --> 00:00:52.688
Just bring it. Have you got the book?
Yogi: Can you bring the book to Shri Mataji?

00:00:59.364 --> 00:01:02.054
This is the one.

00:01:04.605 --> 00:01:06.695
Nirvana Shatakam. This one is the one.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.358
You just read it in English language.
I don't need it.

00:01:15.687 --> 00:01:22.140
When you have got your Nirvana,
what happens to you – it says that.

00:01:25.413 --> 00:01:29.421
Tad Nishkala is also known
as the Atma or Nirvana Shatakam –

00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:35.734
six verses on the theme of spiritual
liberation.

00:01:37.135 --> 00:01:50.119
Neither mind, nor intellect,
ego, nor thought,

00:01:50.370 --> 00:02:04.219
Nor the ears, nor the tongue,
nor the nose, nor the eyes,

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:16.150
Neither ether, nor earth,
nor fire, nor wind,

00:02:16.351 --> 00:02:44.276
Eternal bliss and awareness am I,
I am Shiva, I am Shiva! (x 2)

00:02:44.494 --> 00:02:56.190
Nor the energy of Life,
nor the five vital breaths,

00:02:56.391 --> 00:03:07.840
Nor the body’s seven elements,
nor the body’s five sheaths,

00:03:08.041 --> 00:03:18.737
Neither organs of cleansing,
nor speech, hands, nor feet,

00:03:18.938 --> 00:03:45.643
Eternal bliss and awareness am I,
I am Shiva, I am Shiva! (x 2)

00:03:45.867 --> 00:03:57.244
Neither loathing, nor liking,
attachment, nor greed,

00:03:57.445 --> 00:04:09.433
Nothing of pride or jealousy,

00:04:09.634 --> 00:04:20.054
Neither duty, nor riches,
desire, nor release,

00:04:20.255 --> 00:04:45.288
Eternal bliss and awareness am I,
I am Shiva, I am Shiva! (x 2)

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:55.866
Neither virtue, nor vice,
pleasure, nor pain,

00:04:56.067 --> 00:05:06.452
Holy place, mantra,
Vedas, nor Havan,

00:05:06.653 --> 00:05:16.511
Nor the eater, nor food,
nor enjoyment of eating,

00:05:16.712 --> 00:05:41.374
Eternal bliss and awareness am I,
I am Shiva, I am Shiva! (x 2)

00:05:41.575 --> 00:05:51.943
Neither fear of death,
nor distinction of caste,

00:05:52.144 --> 00:06:03.546
Nor father, nor mother,
nor birth have I,

00:06:03.747 --> 00:06:14.300
Nor disciple, nor guru,
nor brother, nor friend,

00:06:14.501 --> 00:06:40.443
Eternal bliss and awareness am I,
I am Shiva, I am Shiva! (x 2)

00:06:40.792 --> 00:06:50.451
I am without doubt,
I exist without form,

00:06:50.652 --> 00:07:01.527
All-pervading am I,
I give life to the senses,

00:07:01.728 --> 00:07:12.490
Eternal, unchanging,
neither free, nor attached,

00:07:12.691 --> 00:07:35.735
Eternal bliss and awareness am I,
I am Shiva, I am Shiva! (x 2)

00:07:35.952 --> 00:07:49.235
I am Shiva, I am Shiva! (x 2)

00:07:52.014 --> 00:07:56.544
That’s what you are. You are eternal
bliss and awareness.

00:07:56.745 --> 00:08:01.528
The consciousness, the pure consciousness.

00:08:03.404 --> 00:08:06.541
I think, this must be – everybody must
remember by heart

00:08:06.742 --> 00:08:09.416
and must say in all the ashrams.

00:08:09.628 --> 00:08:14.021
That’s a very good way of remembering
what you are.

00:08:14.222 --> 00:08:17.091
May God bless you.
