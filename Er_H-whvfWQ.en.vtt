00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:13.620
So the truth about you is that you are not
this body, mind, your ego, your conditionings.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.120
Because you say this is my
ego, it is my conditioning,

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.540
this is my house, this is my wife, my husband.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.660
So this 'my', who is the 'my' there?

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.040
So you become the 'I', the 'self',
that is the Spirit which you are.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:40.740
And the second truth is that there is all
pervading power which does all the living work.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.560
Look at these beautiful flowers;
it's a miracle, if you see.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.700
There are different flowers from
different seeds of certain heights,

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.320
certain shapes, certain colour.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.640
And we take it for granted.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.780
We don't even think about them
how they have come out like that.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.854
Who runs our heart?

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.760
The doctors will say autonomous nervous system.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.676
But who is the 'auto'?

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.280
So we never question anything about
living process, because we can't answer.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:28.299
This living process is done by a very subtle
energy, which you can call by any name,

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.720
is the divine power of love.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:44.700
You can call it as 'Ruah' as in Quran, you can
call it as 'Brahma Chaitanya' as in Sanskrit

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.260
and as 'Ritambhara Pragya' by Patanjali.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.140
You can give it any name to it,
is different but, it is a power

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.200
which we have never felt before which is
a subtle power which does all living work.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.700
So, as if, if you have not
reached that source of energy,

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.780
the whole development outside is collapsing.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:28.260
Also, supposing this instrument is
not connected to the mains, then,

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.560
it has no identity, it has no meaning.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.484
Why was it created?

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:42.968
And everywhere these days I find the seekers
are trying to find out their identity.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:54.180
So what is your identity, is that you are the
Spirit, you are the Spirit and this Spirit is

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.580
the ultimate that you have to become.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:07.440
Once you become the Spirit, in the
light of the Spirit you see the Truth.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:17.100
First of all on your fingertips you start feeling
this cool breeze, 'Cool breeze of the Holy Ghost',

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.280
you can call it or this 'all
pervading power of divine love'.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:28.620
And when you start feeling that power,
is… your body acts like a computer.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.747
You ask any question.

00:03:32.246 --> 00:03:35.203
There are many people who
don't believe, there is no God.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:44.700
I think it is very unscientific to say there
is no God, because you have not found out.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.060
Without finding out how can
you say there is no God?

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.440
They have all kinds of funny
stories even about Christ.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.874
They say He was not the son of God.

00:03:54.874 --> 00:03:56.534
How do you say?

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:04.020
You are not at that point where you
can decide, what is true, what is not.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:10.140
Just mental projections, they go on
condemning all the great incarnations,

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:16.200
and all the great prophets, and seers
and sages because they are all blind.

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:23.820
Kabira says that, "O God, how am I to explain to
all these people who are blind in this world".

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.993
”Kaise samajhaavu, sab jagah andha."
