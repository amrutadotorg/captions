00:07.016 --> 00:13.610
Yogi: Mother you said in Caxton Hall that
if a person doesn’t speak to their mother

00:14.216 --> 00:20.085
for a long time…can you elaborate
on that theme again please.

00:23.347 --> 00:27.390
Shri Mataji: You see, you are born from a mother, alright?

00:27.514 --> 00:31.191
You are not born hanging from a tree,

00:31.311 --> 00:37.804
and neither you are thrown from the heavens
and suddenly you are found, born on this Earth.

00:37.924 --> 00:40.885
You are born from a mother in her womb.

00:41.005 --> 00:44.835
Her blood flows into you for nine months.

00:44.994 --> 00:49.656
You live upon her.
You are a part and parcel of her being for nine months,

00:49.776 --> 00:53.286
which is the most important time of your life.

00:53.939 --> 00:59.498
Now, she is there to give you, first, the sense of security.

01:00.124 --> 01:03.489
In a mother’s womb a child feels secured.

01:03.609 --> 01:07.406
If the mother is upset it has an effect on the child.

01:07.526 --> 01:11.874
If there’s something wrong with
her then that is affected on the child,

01:11.994 --> 01:14.733
in the sense, physically, also.

01:14.853 --> 01:20.612
It’s such a deep relationship exists between you and your mother

01:20.732 --> 01:24.861
that I’ll have to write a book to tell you how much it is deep within you.

01:24.981 --> 01:33.576
But, within us, the power of Kundalini is the power of a Mother and not of a Father.

01:33.696 --> 01:38.811
The Father is the Witness as a Spirit and the Mother is the Kundalini,

01:38.931 --> 01:41.179
and the Kundalini has to rise.

01:41.299 --> 01:49.007
Now it is the Mother in you that is the Kundalini and your own mother.

01:49.314 --> 01:53.195
It very much depends what kind of relationship you have with your own mother.

01:53.315 --> 01:56.411
Supposing you do not know how to love your own mother,

01:56.531 --> 02:03.306
you can never love your mother country, you can never love it.

02:03.999 --> 02:09.657
That is the beginning. The training starts there only, with your mother.

02:09.777 --> 02:16.920
If that point is lacking then you cannot have a full blooming of that love.

02:17.040 --> 02:20.328
Now maybe the mother has not been a very good mother possibly.

02:20.448 --> 02:25.560
There are according to Sanskrit words, as I told you,

02:25.680 --> 02:31.540
there cannot be a bad mother – kumata –
but sometimes she could be bad also.

02:32.018 --> 02:37.314
So the idea of a ‘bad mother’ is more brought forth by

02:37.434 --> 02:43.062
the intervention of law into mother child relationship.

02:43.214 --> 02:48.748
When the mother is being punished by law

02:48.868 --> 02:53.120
for correcting her child or doing something,

02:53.240 --> 02:59.540
the artificiality starts; when people can sue their mothers.

02:59.773 --> 03:07.012
The responsibility of the law is not to disturb the natural relationships.

03:07.145 --> 03:11.862
If they start disturbing the natural relationship the artificiality starts.

03:11.982 --> 03:20.249
And that’s why, in the countries where law has taken charge of children and such things,

03:21.162 --> 03:26.781
without understanding the basic thing that it is a natural thing to love your child.

03:26.901 --> 03:30.461
Instead of that, if they had encouraged mothers

03:30.581 --> 03:35.349
who were more loving, more kind, if they had even training to mothers,

03:35.469 --> 03:37.822
how to be more kind and gentle,

03:37.942 --> 03:47.312
if they had given more impetus to people to be good mothers.

03:47.475 --> 03:51.802
Instead of having beauty contests if they had ‘good mother contests’.

03:51.922 --> 03:59.827
If motherhood had been upheld by political and economic institutions,

03:59.947 --> 04:03.387
then it would have been much better.

04:03.507 --> 04:07.602
But the whole society is turning to self-destruction,

04:07.722 --> 04:09.968
so the law, first, takes over.

04:10.088 --> 04:12.571
So the child is quite sure of itself.

04:12.691 --> 04:19.463
Now an eighteen year old boy in the family,
who gets the dole (unemployment payments),

04:19.583 --> 04:22.377
then he thinks no end of himself.

04:22.497 --> 04:28.274
He answers back his mother;
he talks in a very rude manner to the mother.

04:28.394 --> 04:31.458
It’s alright to say you have done it for an eighteen year old boy

04:31.578 --> 04:34.142
but you don’t know that [maybe] he is the eldest boy;

04:34.262 --> 04:37.382
the other children in the family follow him up.

04:37.502 --> 04:41.309
So they pick it up when they are even very young.

04:41.429 --> 04:46.370
The idea of giving money to boys at that age also is extremely harmful

04:46.490 --> 04:51.060
because when he gets the money the other
children think they must also get some money,

04:51.180 --> 04:55.490
so they start charging mother for the work that they are doing

04:55.610 --> 05:00.597
– you must pay 5p for bringing a glass of water for the mother.

05:00.724 --> 05:03.540
Then the mothers now are of a different type.

05:03.660 --> 05:06.190
I mean, there are so many mothers who say that,

05:06.310 --> 05:10.390
“It is not a thing that we should love our children; it’s not natural”!

05:10.510 --> 05:14.850
Artificial has become natural and natural has become artificial.

05:14.970 --> 05:20.715
How is it, within these [last] ten or fifteen years,
suddenly the mothers have become so funny?

05:21.462 --> 05:27.760
Now, because of these pressures, what happens
is that we develop a feeling against our mother.

05:27.880 --> 05:32.474
We start judging our mother and father.
We should never judge them.

05:32.594 --> 05:36.048
We are not to judge them because we have chosen them.

05:36.168 --> 05:38.923
They are there just as part and parcel of ourselves.

05:39.043 --> 05:42.671
Supposing your nose is broken:
Do you start judging yourself,

05:42.791 --> 05:46.271
“My nose is broken, my nose is broken”?
Do you discard your nose?

05:46.391 --> 05:53.203
In the same way your parents are.
You cannot discard your parents!

05:53.323 --> 05:56.393
But the whole society is working like this.
It’s a vicious circle.

05:56.514 --> 05:59.598
Now, if I say, “You go and talk to your mother,”
then you can say,

05:59.719 --> 06:03.405
“My mother is not a good person. She is this and that.”

06:05.733 --> 06:10.410
Then I have to say, “Alright, then you forgive her.”
Then you don’t like it.

06:10.574 --> 06:14.795
You would expect me to tell you,
“Alright, just go and bash her.”

06:14.915 --> 06:18.400
You would be pleased if I tell you like that,
some of you would

06:18.520 --> 06:22.546
– “Go and beat her up!” But I would not say like that

06:22.666 --> 06:25.973
because that’s not the way
Sahaja Yogis are going to work away.

06:26.127 --> 06:30.893
You must know that the whole society
is in a whirlwind, it’s a whirlwind,

06:31.013 --> 06:37.566
so somebody has to steady oneself
and stop and try to change the winds.

06:37.686 --> 06:40.293
And that’s why a Sahaja Yogi has to stand up

06:40.413 --> 06:44.775
and understand that respect and reverence of parents is important.

06:44.895 --> 06:50.712
But it is an actual thing, because if you are
not good with your mother your left side is weak;

06:51.089 --> 06:56.235
you have seen it on the vibrations. Whatever I say
you can see it on your vibrations. You will be the loser.

06:56.355 --> 06:59.370
So forgive her. Know that she has given you birth.

06:59.490 --> 07:03.902
Maybe if she has been harsh to you,
angry with you or done something

07:04.022 --> 07:07.872
– forgive her. And you will be amazed, you can win her over,

07:07.992 --> 07:11.284
it’s not difficult because by your goodness to her,

07:11.404 --> 07:17.133
by your over-goodness towards her, relatively, it will work.

07:17.254 --> 07:20.443
And maybe, exceptionally, one person may be this thing (kumata)

07:20.563 --> 07:23.714
but you cannot make a rule out of that;
exceptionally one may be.

07:23.834 --> 07:29.923
But if you have to change the society,
the whole thinking, somebody has to stand up.

07:31.682 --> 07:37.450
And it is a chakra within you, you know,
where it touches a point of Void,

07:37.570 --> 07:40.052
where the left-side touches the point of Void.

07:40.172 --> 07:44.714
That is a centre, a very important centre
for a mother, which [it] makes.

07:45.588 --> 07:50.836
And do you know it is very near the centre of existence,

07:50.956 --> 07:54.191
because your existence depends on that.

07:54.389 --> 07:58.634
Supposing a child had no mother:
he can never be a good husband,

07:58.754 --> 08:02.150
very difficult for him to be a good husband
because all the womanhood,

08:02.270 --> 08:08.391
all the kindness, the sublimity, the greatness of women,
is known through your mother to begin with;

08:11.475 --> 08:14.877
or a woman who does not have a
mother, can never be a good wife

08:14.997 --> 08:17.529
or could not be a good mother herself.

08:17.649 --> 08:21.588
All these things are there so we have to stop it and change it.

08:21.708 --> 08:25.846
This is the point. Sahaja Yogis must know
that we have to change and transform ourselves

08:25.966 --> 08:28.132
and that is the point [where] they feel bad.

08:28.253 --> 08:33.137
We are not only responsible for our change but
we have to bring about the change in the whole world,

08:33.258 --> 08:37.605
where the society is getting destroyed,
the human beings are getting destroyed,

08:37.725 --> 08:40.393
so we have to stand up.

08:40.513 --> 08:43.612
So we have to change our way of thinking.

08:48.672 --> 08:54.289
What’s wrong in talking to your mother?
She’s not going to kill you if you talk to her.

08:54.409 --> 08:57.160
Why don’t you talk to her? Because you hate her,

08:57.280 --> 08:59.925
you want her to feel bad.

09:02.418 --> 09:04.997
I mean, you don’t go and hit your mother.

09:05.117 --> 09:09.939
This is the only way you can really be harsh
to her, is not to talk to her

09:10.318 --> 09:15.361
– [so] she feels rejected by her own child
whom she has created.

09:15.815 --> 09:19.858
God must be feeling that way also the way we reject Him.

09:31.308 --> 09:35.119
But try to love and you will enjoy,
because loving is the greatest thing.

09:35.239 --> 09:38.822
To love someone is adoration,
absolute adoration, is reverence.

09:38.942 --> 09:46.855
If you love someone then you know that
it is so great, it makes you so great to love someone.

09:49.118 --> 09:53.339
It’s a very great feeling that, “I love someone”;
it’s like a Lord one feels,

09:53.459 --> 09:57.115
“Oh I love this one and I love so many
and so many are there!”

09:57.275 --> 09:59.860
And that person need not love me,

09:59.980 --> 10:04.832
I mean I don’t think all the Sahaja Yogis
love me so much as I love them, maybe.

10:04.952 --> 10:09.357
But I’m very proud of my Sahaja Yogis and I love them.

10:09.743 --> 10:13.568
This is the most joy-giving thing is to love, yourself.

10:13.688 --> 10:19.289
To be able to love, that’s the greatest ability
a person should have – is to love others.

10:19.416 --> 10:25.153
And in love, forgiveness is the most; that’s why
Christ said forgiveness is the greatest weapon.

10:25.687 --> 10:29.745
And what do you achieve by not talking?
I mean, what do you achieve?

10:29.865 --> 10:35.302
Let us see the other side of it; what do we
achieve by not talking to someone?

10:39.372 --> 10:48.509
Rationally. It’s a sweet method of course, if sometimes
children do, “I am not talking to you,” you see.

10:48.629 --> 10:52.369
Then you can have a little play about that.
But it should be just a play.

10:52.489 --> 10:56.913
If it is a serious stuff it’s nonsense.

10:57.099 --> 11:01.060
It’s just to play about, is very good that,
“I’m not talking to you,

11:01.180 --> 11:05.954
I’m not going to talk to you for some time,” he knows that.

11:07.267 --> 11:13.632
But then it is not serious, it is just to bring out certain points

11:13.752 --> 11:18.505
and it’s nice that mother should come and cuddle you
and persuade you and try to help you

11:18.625 --> 11:26.610
– that’s a good thing. But the way we are serious
about it is something wrong.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Everybody’s left side improves now.
