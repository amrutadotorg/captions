00:00.000 --> 01:02.730
00:01:16:27 00:01:21:09 First, I will speak
in Hindi language and then in English.

01:02.730 --> 01:25.090
00:01:21:13 00:01:25:02 We are such a cosmopolitan
people

01:25.090 --> 01:32.980
00:01:25:06 00:01:28:23 that I don’t know
what language to take to.

01:32.980 --> 01:46.560
00:01:48:28 00:01:51:13 [Shri Mataji speaks
in Hindi]

01:46.560 --> 01:58.850
00:22:47:11 00:22:51:21 I am talking to them
about Shiva’s worship -

01:58.850 --> 02:03.320
00:22:51:29 00:22:54:05 what should happen
to you.

02:03.320 --> 02:11.009
00:22:54:11 00:22:56:23 But today, I am going
to tell you about

02:11.009 --> 02:25.580
00:22:56:27 00:22:59:09 the internal happening
within us

02:25.580 --> 02:33.490
00:22:59:17 00:23:02:13 when you get your
Realization.

02:33.490 --> 02:42.190
00:23:02:22 00:23:07:23 There are eleven rudras
placed here – eleven of them.

02:42.190 --> 02:50.600
00:23:08:03 00:23:12:07 They are particles,
we can say, anshas they call it,

02:50.600 --> 02:55.019
00:23:12:15 00:23:15:13 of Shiva’s powers.

02:55.019 --> 03:03.849
00:23:15:23 00:23:21:18 And all of them try
to take out

03:03.849 --> 03:16.940
00:23:21:29 00:23:27:18 or to remove all the
false ideas we have about life.

03:16.940 --> 03:26.700
00:23:28:05 00:23:33:23 When the Kundalini
rises, they all get enlightened - eleven of

03:26.700 --> 03:27.700
them.

03:27.700 --> 03:38.599
00:23:34:04 00:23:36:03 And, say for example,
00:23:36:09 00:23:41:01 Buddha had a part

03:38.599 --> 03:45.920
of that, Mahavira had a part of that.

03:45.920 --> 03:58.489
00:23:41:18 00:23:47:07 Now, all of them,
what they do is to control us

03:58.489 --> 04:09.950
00:23:47:17 00:23:52:05 from falling into
the prey of various things.

04:09.950 --> 04:17.180
00:23:52:15 00:23:55:03 Like, we have an ego.

04:17.180 --> 04:25.350
00:23:55:10 00:23:58:23 So, Buddha will look
after the ego part.

04:25.350 --> 04:33.850
00:23:59:01 00:24:04:11 He will see that you
get shocked by your ego.

04:33.850 --> 04:38.230
00:24:04:22 00:24:07:00 You will be quite
amazed

04:38.230 --> 04:42.280
00:24:07:06 00:24:11:10 how you could be so
egoistical,

04:42.280 --> 04:46.090
00:24:11:19 00:24:16:16 and so insulting,
and so humiliating.

04:46.090 --> 04:51.330
00:24:16:28 00:24:22:17 But when this rudra
is not awakened,

04:51.330 --> 05:03.910
00:24:22:25 00:24:28:13 when there is no light
in this rudra, then what happens?

05:03.910 --> 05:09.620
00:24:28:23 00:24:30:21 You start justifying
yourself.

05:09.620 --> 05:19.160
00:24:30:28 00:24:33:03 You think whatever
you do is correct,

05:19.160 --> 05:28.700
00:24:33:11 00:24:35:24 whatever you’ve
done, whatever you’ve said,

05:28.700 --> 05:35.850
00:24:36:00 00:24:40:10 whatever you have
achieved,

05:35.850 --> 05:41.900
00:24:40:18 00:24:42:16 you think is your
right.

05:41.900 --> 05:45.020
00:24:42:23 00:24:44:24 You’ve done nothing
wrong.

05:45.020 --> 05:50.740
00:24:45:01 00:24:51:01 For that, this Buddha’s
rudra has to be awakened.

05:50.740 --> 05:59.280
00:24:52:09 00:24:56:19 On the contrary, if
you go on pampering your ego,

05:59.280 --> 06:05.979
00:24:56:28 00:25:00:11 if you go on becoming
egoistical,

06:05.979 --> 06:12.680
00:25:00:18 00:25:04:27 you become absolutely
a right-sided personality.

06:12.680 --> 06:18.280
00:25:05:05 00:25:06:25 Once you are a right-sided
personality,

06:18.280 --> 06:28.800
00:25:07:03 00:25:11:22 you know what all
the symptoms there are of such a person.

06:28.800 --> 06:37.880
00:25:11:28 00:25:14:16 Now, for that if you
just watch

06:37.880 --> 06:45.979
00:25:14:23 00:25:19:27 and introspect and
see for yourself what ego has done to you,

06:45.979 --> 06:50.750
00:25:20:05 00:25:23:27 what wrong ideas you
had about yourself.

06:50.750 --> 06:59.330
00:25:24:09 00:25:28:05 So that’s why Mohammed
Saheb has said, “Beat yourself with shoes.”

06:59.330 --> 07:05.259
00:25:28:16 00:25:31:11 He didn’t know what
else to tell.

07:05.259 --> 07:11.860
00:25:31:18 00:25:37:18 Because this ego business
can really burst you,

07:11.860 --> 07:21.300
00:25:38:00 00:25:43:06 your head completely,
and you may land up into so many difficulties.

07:21.300 --> 07:29.190
00:25:43:13 00:25:49:04 Ultimately, I have
seen people developing this yuppie’s disease

07:29.190 --> 07:34.560
00:25:49:12 00:25:55:11 where the conscious
mind becomes absolutely useless,

07:34.560 --> 07:37.050
00:25:55:27 00:25:58:01 cannot move.

07:37.050 --> 07:40.790
00:25:58:09 00:26:00:21 Consciously people
cannot move.

07:40.790 --> 07:45.230
00:26:00:28 00:26:05:00 Unconsciously they
will, but not consciously.

07:45.230 --> 07:49.490
00:26:05:12 00:26:08:18 And this disease is
so horrible.

07:49.490 --> 07:53.650
A person becomes like a reptile.
00:26:08:25 00:26:11:29 You have to carry

07:53.650 --> 07:56.160
them on your body.

07:56.160 --> 07:59.919
They can’t walk on their own.

07:59.919 --> 08:04.930
00:26:12:06 00:26:15:12 They can’t sit on
their own.

08:04.930 --> 08:11.199
00:26:15:29 00:26:19:09 In a very young age
this can happen.

08:11.199 --> 08:14.330
This is happening in America.

08:14.330 --> 08:20.599
00:26:19:15 00:26:22:10 Also, I have seen
two, three cases here,

08:20.599 --> 08:26.240
00:26:22:17 00:26:24:23 in India, also such
a thing happened.

08:26.240 --> 08:38.120
00:26:25:00 00:26:29:21 So if you do not try
to see your ego and control it,

08:38.120 --> 08:45.000
00:26:29:28 00:26:33:28 and feel repentant
about it.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.899
00:26:34:27 00:26:36:24 In Sahaja Yoga, there
is nothing like repentance,

08:49.899 --> 08:52.779
00:26:37:00 00:26:38:18 we don’t believe
in repentance.

08:52.779 --> 08:57.450
00:26:38:24 00:26:42:10 Because we believe
that you all have got your Realization,

08:57.450 --> 09:00.940
00:26:42:16 00:26:47:13 you are beyond any
mistakes.

09:00.940 --> 09:02.399
It’s not true.

09:02.399 --> 09:08.240
00:26:49:12 00:26:51:21 We have to repent.
00:26:51:28 00:26:53:28 There’s a, in English,

09:08.240 --> 09:10.470
there is a word – sorry.

09:10.470 --> 09:15.519
00:26:54:05 00:26:55:19 Sorry, for everything
they will say sorry.

09:15.519 --> 09:21.700
00:26:55:25 00:26:57:27 Even telephone if
you pick up, they’ll say, “sorry.”

09:21.700 --> 09:25.630
00:26:58:04 00:27:01:07 I say, “Sorry, for
what?”

09:25.630 --> 09:31.269
00:27:01:18 00:27:05:07 But this sorry itself
is very empty.

09:31.269 --> 09:34.839
00:27:05:13 00:27:08:23 It has no meaning.

09:34.839 --> 09:37.220
It has no depth.

09:37.220 --> 09:45.519
00:27:09:00 00:27:13:05 When you say “sorry,”
you have to see why you are saying “sorry,”

09:45.519 --> 09:50.110
00:27:13:12 00:27:16:00 and what is to be
corrected.

09:50.110 --> 09:55.660
00:27:16:07 00:27:20:13 This is a very big
problem of today’s generation

09:55.660 --> 09:56.660
00:27:20:21 00:27:23:29 where people have
developed such tremendous ego-

09:56.660 --> 09:58.890
00:27:24:05 00:27:27:16 because all our economic
growth,

09:58.890 --> 10:02.470
00:27:27:23 00:27:32:00 all our industrial
developments,

10:02.470 --> 10:09.079
00:27:32:10 00:27:36:00 all our big, big organizations,
00:27:36:07 00:27:40:25 all of them have given

10:09.079 --> 10:11.830
us a way
00:27:41:03 00:27:43:10 that we should all

10:11.830 --> 10:12.830
develop our ego.

10:12.830 --> 10:18.899
00:27:43:17 00:27:47:28 If we don’t develop
our ego we will be lost, we are nowhere.

10:18.899 --> 10:23.930
00:27:48:05 00:27:50:13 And that’s how we
start pampering it,

10:23.930 --> 10:28.399
00:27:50:21 00:27:55:19 and then this right-sided
problem starts.

10:28.399 --> 10:33.450
00:27:56:29 00:28:00:07 Then as a reaction,
it goes to the left side.

10:33.450 --> 10:40.250
00:28:01:04 00:28:03:17 Actually, in the head
it is on the right side.

10:40.250 --> 10:45.480
00:28:03:23 00:28:07:04 Here is the right
side ego comes up,

10:45.480 --> 10:48.580
00:28:07:11 00:28:12:03 so the left rudra
is that of Mahavira.

10:48.580 --> 10:52.030
00:28:14:06 00:28:19:00 So people do things,
which are sinful,

10:52.030 --> 10:59.730
00:28:19:27 00:28:24:22 which are wrong, which
are against Shri Ganesha.

10:59.730 --> 11:08.980
00:28:25:28 00:28:30:21 Then also there are
controlling powers of Mahavira, who controls.

11:08.980 --> 11:17.680
00:28:30:27 00:28:33:29 He says, “You will
go to hell; this will happen,”

11:17.680 --> 11:24.220
00:28:34:06 00:28:36:28 he describes all the
hell, all kinds of hell,

11:24.220 --> 11:28.420
00:28:37:06 00:28:40:07 that you’ll go to
hell and you’ll be burnt alive -

11:28.420 --> 11:35.709
00:28:40:15 00:28:44:19 I don’t know, all
kinds of things He describes to frighten you.

11:35.709 --> 11:37.709
00:28:45:04 00:28:48:09 But that doesn’t
help.

11:37.709 --> 11:39.480
00:28:48:24 00:28:52:15 So people start getting
more onto the left side

11:39.480 --> 11:46.610
00:28:52:22 00:28:53:25 and, I should say,
00:28:54:03 00:28:57:19 through this rudra,

11:46.610 --> 11:53.090
when this rudra gets helpless,
00:28:57:27 00:29:01:22 then a tremendous

11:53.090 --> 11:55.030
depression comes in.

11:55.030 --> 11:58.920
00:29:02:05 00:29:05:18 One feels very depressed.

11:58.920 --> 12:00.210
“Oh God.

12:00.210 --> 12:04.750
00:29:05:27 00:29:09:25 What a depression
I have.

12:04.750 --> 12:07.340
I am so sick.

12:07.340 --> 12:09.930
I am this thing.”

12:09.930 --> 12:17.700
00:29:10:03 00:29:15:09 And then you try to
frighten others with your depressions.

12:17.700 --> 12:25.200
00:29:15:22 00:29:20:03 You show sort of a,
what you call, an emotional blackmail you

12:25.200 --> 12:26.200
do.

12:26.200 --> 12:30.550
00:29:20:16 00:29:22:13 All kinds of things
you will do,

12:30.550 --> 12:36.690
00:29:22:19 00:29:25:29 and beat your head
and do all kinds of things.

12:36.690 --> 12:40.110
00:29:26:06 00:29:29:06 Could be through ego,
could be through

12:40.110 --> 12:44.579
00:29:29:12 00:29:37:11 this left side problem
of the left rudra.

12:44.579 --> 12:50.440
00:29:37:25 00:29:40:27 These two rudras are
very important

12:50.440 --> 12:55.730
00:29:41:06 00:29:44:03 because they are directly
connected with our

12:55.730 --> 13:00.730
00:29:44:10 00:29:48:01 left and right sympathetic
nervous system.

13:00.730 --> 13:07.220
00:29:48:10 00:29:49:19 So, it’s very important
to see

13:07.220 --> 13:12.320
00:29:49:25 00:29:54:16 that you don’t fall
a prey to these rudras.

13:12.320 --> 13:16.100
00:29:54:24 00:29:57:22 These rudras are to
be satisfied.

13:16.100 --> 13:25.610
00:29:58:00 00:30:02:25 So to be normal, at
least look after these two rudras, which are:

13:25.610 --> 13:32.149
00:30:03:01 00:30:08:25 one is the one who
controls the ego, and another is self-pity.

13:32.149 --> 13:33.149
00:30:09:09 00:30:13:22 “I just can’t
do it, I’m this, that” and all kinds of

13:33.149 --> 13:34.149
depression.

13:34.149 --> 13:36.820
00:30:13:29 00:30:18:25 All this works out
00:30:19:03 00:30:23:25 into, physically also,

13:36.820 --> 13:38.720
into very serious problems like cancer.

13:38.720 --> 13:41.449
00:30:24:05 00:30:27:18 If the rudras are
caught up, you develop cancer.

13:41.449 --> 13:43.190
00:30:27:24 00:30:32:12 But all this portion
gets swollen up.

13:43.190 --> 13:47.250
It’s called as the medha.
00:30:32:21 00:30:34:29 This all portion gets

13:47.250 --> 13:51.670
swollen up,
00:30:35:07 00:30:39:25 and you can see a

13:51.670 --> 13:55.110
cancer patient having a swelling all over.

13:55.110 --> 14:00.019
00:30:40:03 00:30:43:01 At least would be
here, or maybe there.

14:00.019 --> 14:05.360
00:30:43:09 00:30:46:19 Because such a swing
in the nature of a person

14:05.360 --> 14:10.329
00:30:46:28 00:30:48:00 that you can’t say
00:30:48:07 00:30:52:21 from which rudra they

14:10.329 --> 14:12.459
have developed these psychosomatic troubles.

14:12.459 --> 14:14.720
00:30:52:29 00:30:55:28 Psychosomatic troubles,
all of them, come

14:14.720 --> 14:18.459
00:30:56:04 00:31:00:29 because the rudras
have become ineffective.

14:18.459 --> 14:24.620
00:31:01:12 00:31:07:12 It can be due to the
depressive nature

14:24.620 --> 14:26.030
00:31:07:28 00:31:11:18 or oppressive nature.

14:26.030 --> 14:29.360
00:31:11:28 00:31:15:04 It could be due to
many other factors also.

14:29.360 --> 14:31.220
00:31:15:10 00:31:18:01 But all these factors
are nothing

14:31.220 --> 14:34.620
00:31:18:09 00:31:25:19 but part and parcel
of Shri Shiva’s,

14:34.620 --> 14:38.620
00:31:25:27 00:31:28:25 or Sadashiva’s powers.

14:38.620 --> 14:44.120
00:31:29:04 00:31:35:10 He is the one who
is full of karuna - full of compassion.

14:44.120 --> 14:46.990
00:31:35:16 00:31:38:22 He is the ocean of
compassion.

14:46.990 --> 14:51.220
00:31:38:29 00:31:42:06 If you ask Him forgiveness,
He'll forgive.

14:51.220 --> 15:00.470
00:31:42:13 00:31:47:05 Whatever you do, instead
of feeling guilty if you ask forgiveness,

15:00.470 --> 15:06.339
00:31:47:12 00:31:49:09 then He forgives.
00:31:49:18 00:31:52:16 But if you think you,

15:06.339 --> 15:12.440
whatever you have done is good,
00:31:52:22 00:31:57:28 you’ve never tortured

15:12.440 --> 15:17.040
anybody, you have never made anybody suffer,
00:31:58:11 00:32:00:28 then it knows.

15:17.040 --> 15:19.750
00:32:01:25 00:32:04:05 Shiva knows everything,
isn’t it?

15:19.750 --> 15:23.610
00:32:04:13 00:32:08:03 And, because it knows,
it starts giving up.

15:23.610 --> 15:27.200
00:32:08:10 00:32:14:07 So there’s a big
combination of your willpower

15:27.200 --> 15:29.949
00:32:14:15 00:32:19:03 to be there, and the
combination of the blessings of Shiva.

15:29.949 --> 15:32.220
00:32:19:11 00:32:22:22 When the Shiva blesses
you,

15:32.220 --> 15:34.680
00:32:23:01 00:32:26:03 your willpower also
heightens.

15:34.680 --> 15:41.509
00:32:26:10 00:32:30:12 But you must have
full willpower

15:41.509 --> 15:49.380
00:32:30:23 00:32:32:10 to know that you have
00:32:32:17 00:32:38:07 to be of a higher

15:49.380 --> 15:50.390
level of personality.

15:50.390 --> 15:54.529
00:32:39:03 00:32:41:29 He was not at all
a mundane type.

15:54.529 --> 16:02.060
00:32:42:05 00:32:43:15 I mean He was…
00:32:43:21 00:32:47:10 supposing, ask Shiva

16:02.060 --> 16:09.010
to go to some party and all that,
00:32:47:16 00:32:49:11 how will He look there?

16:09.010 --> 16:13.040
00:32:49:17 00:32:51:11 People will laugh
at Him.

16:13.040 --> 16:18.209
00:32:51:18 00:32:52:24 When I met some hippies,
I said,

16:18.209 --> 16:23.450
00:32:53:00 00:32:55:09 “Why are you having
this kind of hair?”

16:23.450 --> 16:29.589
00:32:55:16 00:32:58:03 So they said, “We
want to -” they are all primitive -

16:29.589 --> 16:34.709
00:32:58:10 00:33:00:06 so he said, “I want
to be primitive.”

16:34.709 --> 16:38.260
00:33:00:15 00:33:01:28 I said, “But the
brain is modern.

16:38.260 --> 16:41.660
00:33:02:04 00:33:05:28 What’s the use of
having primitive hair?”

16:41.660 --> 16:43.320
00:33:06:07 00:33:11:07 So, deception.

16:43.320 --> 16:48.130
Deceiving yourself is not going to help.

16:48.130 --> 16:55.070
00:33:11:13 00:33:14:24 Best thing is to face
yourself and understand

16:55.070 --> 16:58.480
00:33:15:00 00:33:17:23 what wrong you have
been doing.

16:58.480 --> 17:04.410
00:33:18:01 00:33:19:17 If it works out, I
tell you,

17:04.410 --> 17:10.439
00:33:19:23 00:33:22:17 so many Sahaja Yogis
you are sitting here.

17:10.439 --> 17:18.309
00:33:22:24 00:33:26:06 If you correct yourself
and become that

17:18.309 --> 17:25.199
00:33:26:13 00:33:30:01 I am sure all the
problems - political, economic,

17:25.199 --> 17:33.350
00:33:30:07 00:33:34:03 and all stupid problems
we have - will be finished.

17:33.350 --> 17:38.130
00:33:34:12 00:33:37:13 But today it’s such
a mixture, due to Kali Yuga,

17:38.130 --> 17:46.880
00:33:37:19 00:33:43:18 that even the worst
people are carrying on.

17:46.880 --> 17:52.710
00:33:43:28 00:33:49:01 Now, we have a responsibility
to save this world.

17:52.710 --> 17:59.070
00:33:49:09 00:33:55:06 We have a responsibility
to create a great, honorable life,

17:59.070 --> 18:05.960
00:33:55:13 00:33:58:17 which is not superficial,
which is not just to show off.

18:05.960 --> 18:13.400
00:33:58:23 00:34:01:11 But inside it should
develop

18:13.400 --> 18:17.240
00:34:01:18 00:34:07:17 so that this light
of your spirit spreads

18:17.240 --> 18:20.410
00:34:07:27 00:34:10:07 and enlightens this
world.

18:20.410 --> 18:24.100
00:34:10:17 00:34:12:21 It’s very important
to understand

18:24.100 --> 18:27.790
00:34:12:27 00:34:14:17 all these troubles
and these,

18:27.790 --> 18:32.000
00:34:14:23 00:34:17:17 I should say, diseases,
psychosomatic diseases,

18:32.000 --> 18:36.850
00:34:17:24 00:34:22:03 and all other problems
which are,in a collective way we can call,

18:36.850 --> 18:41.710
00:34:22:09 00:34:28:06 of the Kali Yuga like
political, economic, all these problems -

18:41.710 --> 18:45.590
00:34:28:13 00:34:32:05 only are created by
human beings.

18:45.590 --> 18:49.960
00:34:32:16 00:34:35:12 They're not created
by the Divine Force.

18:49.960 --> 18:53.690
00:34:35:19 00:34:39:25 But Divine Force tries
to neutralize them

18:53.690 --> 18:58.880
00:34:40:04 00:34:43:13 if there are many
Sahaja Yogis

18:58.880 --> 19:05.320
00:34:43:21 00:34:48:25 who are practicing
Sahaja Yoga in the real sense of the word.

19:05.320 --> 19:12.580
00:34:49:13 00:34:55:11 If that could be done,
if that could be achieved,

19:12.580 --> 19:16.289
00:34:57:12 00:35:00:04 then I think we can
do a lot,

19:16.289 --> 19:19.539
00:35:00:11 00:35:03:13 a lot for the betterment
of humanity,

19:19.539 --> 19:26.020
00:35:03:21 00:35:05:24 and that’s why we
have got realization.

19:26.020 --> 19:31.809
00:35:06:03 00:35:11:03 It’s not only for
yourself, it’s not only for your family,

19:31.809 --> 19:36.630
00:35:11:10 00:35:13:10 it’s not only for
your city or country,

19:36.630 --> 19:49.040
00:35:13:16 00:35:18:00 but for the whole
world Sahaja Yoga is going to work out.

19:49.040 --> 19:56.530
00:35:18:09 00:35:20:09 Now, if you have to
do competition,

19:56.530 --> 20:03.510
00:35:20:16 00:35:25:11 you must only do competition
in your ascent and in nothing else.

20:03.510 --> 20:07.640
00:35:25:18 00:35:27:28 But people are so
superficial

20:07.640 --> 20:11.440
00:35:28:05 00:35:30:24 that they think by
showing off

20:11.440 --> 20:16.120
00:35:31:00 00:35:34:13 or by becoming something
– a big Johnny -

20:16.120 --> 20:28.179
00:35:34:23 00:35:39:25 they will achieve
something of a very great level, is not so.

20:28.179 --> 20:54.500
00:35:40:10 00:35:46:10 It has to be a very
humble attitude towards yourself also,

20:54.500 --> 21:37.520
00:35:46:28 00:35:50:10 so that you understand
that whatever you are doing

21:37.520 --> 21:52.820
00:35:50:18 00:35:52:06 is

21:52.820 --> 22:03.030
for the betterment
00:35:52:13 00:35:58:06 of global problems.

22:03.030 --> 22:20.240
00:35:58:17 00:36:04:05 Absolutely we can
solve because you are

22:20.240 --> 22:28.990
the channels of the Divine.
00:36:04:12 00:36:06:11 If I could do it alone,

22:28.990 --> 22:31.680
I would have done it.

22:31.680 --> 22:41.840
00:36:06:18 00:36:09:27 But I can’t, so
that’s why I had to gather you all

22:41.840 --> 23:21.210
00:36:10:03 00:36:13:04 and to tell you that
you

23:21.210 --> 23:24.520
become all the channels.

23:24.520 --> 23:29.610
00:36:13:10 00:36:15:22 But in the meanwhile,
you enjoy.

23:29.610 --> 23:33.270
00:36:15:29 00:36:21:11 You enjoy life.

23:33.270 --> 23:41.730
Every second becomes a joy,
00:36:21:19 00:36:24:18 which is also the

23:41.730 --> 23:50.100
gift of Shiva.
00:36:24:25 00:36:27:18 Shiva is the one who

23:50.100 --> 23:53.460
creates this
00:36:27:27 00:36:30:29 great admiration

23:53.460 --> 23:57.940
00:36:31:06 00:36:36:12 and great appreciation
of every moment,

23:57.940 --> 24:05.970
00:36:36:19 00:36:38:21 everything that is
there.

24:05.970 --> 24:30.230
00:36:38:29 00:36:42:00 And
that is the state we have to achieve,

24:30.230 --> 24:42.430
00:36:42:06 00:36:44:11 by not condemning
yourself,

24:42.430 --> 24:58.450
00:36:44:18 00:36:50:17 or not by pampering
your ego,

24:58.450 --> 25:07.370
00:36:50:24 00:36:53:17 but by seeing what
you are.

25:07.370 --> 25:13.580
00:36:53:25 00:36:57:28 That’s the main
thing one has to see, is what problem you

25:13.580 --> 25:21.280
have,
00:36:58:05 00:37:02:07 and what is troubling

25:21.280 --> 25:29.010
you is yourself only.

25:29.010 --> 25:44.210
00:37:02:19 00:37:07:05 If you could just
come to that point of understanding,

25:44.210 --> 25:57.910
00:37:07:15 00:37:10:24 I am sure, I am very,
very sure

25:57.910 --> 26:15.850
00:37:11:01 00:37:15:16 that you will be such
an asset

26:15.850 --> 26:32.000
00:37:15:25 00:37:21:24 to help to make this
world look at itself and change.

26:32.000 --> 26:41.320
00:37:22:01 00:37:27:09 Because superficially
you cannot change such deep-rooted problems.

26:41.320 --> 29:05.179
00:37:27:15 00:37:31:22 And, you are being
so blessed by Kundalini

29:05.179 --> 30:20.700
00:37:32:00 00:37:37:24 that you
can

30:20.700 --> 30:36.690
really become a great
00:37:38:07 00:37:39:29 torch, I should say,

30:36.690 --> 30:48.830
00:37:40:05 00:37:46:03 torch on
the path of truth, love and joy.

30:48.830 --> 30:58.549
00:37:46:18 00:37:51:16 May God bless you.

30:58.549 --> 31:10.200
00:38:04:03 00:38:06:27 Today first we'll
have a short puja of

31:10.200 --> 32:01.809
00:38:07:10 00:38:08:22 Shri Ganesh
00:38:09:09 00:38:11:04 and then of

32:01.809 --> 33:44.519
Shiva
00:38:10:17 00:38:12:19 And lastly of

33:44.519 --> 34:41.770
the Goddess.
00:38:12:29 00:38:15:23 We

34:41.770 --> 37:47.540
have little bit changed the sequence.
