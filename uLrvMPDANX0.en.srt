1
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,400
How are you Pat?

2
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,400
Very well Mother.

3
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,640
Put My shawl there. I think [unclear].

4
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,080
Sit down. Please be seated.

5
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,640
People from Brighton have come? Has Sil come?

6
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,800
No?

7
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,920
I beg your pardon.

8
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,920
They have evening classes [unclear].

9
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,800
But today they could have come from the evening class.

10
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,440
Gavin, just come here for one minute.

11
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,440
This ventilator is so strong. I just can't bear it.

12
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,880
If you don't mind I'll ...

13
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,920
I know there are some ...

14
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,560
It is better to say it now.

15
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,800
It's too much. I personally think.

16
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,680
There are of course extreme cases as I said.

17
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,920
[unclear]

18
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,240
the palms, the hands, with the palms [unclear]

19
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,880
[unclear] you are asking for a gift.

20
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,640
I'm Myself going into austerities all the time.

21
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,960
I don't take any lunch, breakfast, nothing else, very little.

22
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,880
I've received such letters from India also and they said the same.

23
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,880
Some of them are really,

24
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,280
I just don't know, why it happens like that.

25
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,680
Like Gill said that it took six months for her to get vibrations,

26
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,400
while there are people who are feeling the vibrations.

27
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,280
Just they saw [unclear].

28
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,240
It's true, I mean I don't know what to say. What to do, you say.

29
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,040
Let’s start.

30
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:41,920
Today is a day of departure for Me, for India,

31
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,080
and, I am very sad that

32
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,880
I have to leave My children here.

33
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,280
It’s a sad day, no doubt.

34
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,640
But I have to go as you know and you all are going to join Me,

35
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,680
quite a lot of you.

36
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,160
But those who are going to stay here

37
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:10,800
have to understand that they are here with a purpose,

38
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,600
not without a purpose.

39
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,080
And during My absence

40
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,000
one should not waste that time.

41
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:31,800
On the contrary, you must put your mind

42
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,400
to find out what you can do

43
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:47,280
to improve the

44
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,880
conditions of other Sahaja Yogis.

45
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:00,520
Many of you are

46
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,000
Sahaja Yogis and you have felt cool breeze from the very first day,

47
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,560
and have been feeling it all through.

48
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,160
But there are so many, still,

49
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,520
who don’t even feel the cool breeze

50
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,560
and they feel very funny about it and feel sort of guilty.

51
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,280
Sometimes they feel that they are something

52
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,800
of a lower type, or something wrong with them,

53
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,240
that they don’t feel the cool breeze.

54
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,680
So, one of the greatest worry,

55
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,520
for all of you, should be that

56
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,240
there are some people who are not feeling anything in their hands.

57
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,840
They have been coming to Sahaja Yoga, have been

58
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,560
religiously working it out,

59
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,080
but they haven’t been able to achieve

60
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,200
the first experience of cool breeze.

61
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:20,640
For this there can be many, many reasons,

62
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,400
not one, but there can be many reasons.

63
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:29,800
And without getting involved into these reasons,

64
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,800
if you try to see within yourself,

65
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,600
and if others who have felt it are compassionate and kind,

66
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,000
they can definitely help others.

67
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:51,800
But the worst thing that we human beings suffer from,

68
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,360
is ego.

69
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,160
And this ego makes us feel small

70
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,600
at the slightest thing anybody tries to help you.

71
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,320
Some people might have a hurt ego,

72
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:15,440
might have a bloated ego, might have

73
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:21,120
a state of mind,

74
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,960
which does not even see the ego.

75
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:32,400
And that is why it is difficult

76
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:41,760
to talk to anyone what is to be done to improve.

77
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,400
So those who are better off, suffer from a dilemma.

78
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,560
They don’t want to hurt another person,

79
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,760
and another fear they have, that if they try to help others

80
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,880
their ego might go up.

81
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,720
Because they are afraid of their own ego.

82
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:17,560
But we must understand that, once we have come to Sahaja Yoga,

83
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,080
once our Kundalini has been awakened,

84
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:29,040
then, all of us have now become part and parcel of one body,

85
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:37,400
of one body of the great Primordial Being.

86
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,720
In a body, as human bodies are,

87
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,080
supposing a finger is numb,

88
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,400
then all the body’s attention is on that finger to cure it.

89
00:11:54,080 --> 00:12:00,960
And all the other fingers and the whole body, the brain,

90
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,760
the mind you can call it,

91
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,400
everything is worried about that finger ,

92
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,960
how to make it all right.

93
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:17,960
Naturally there is no ego for these fingers,

94
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,880
so nobody feels hurt or bad.

95
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,320
And the fingers are also anxious to do it, because they can feel

96
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,720
the problem of the finger which is numb.

97
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,800
If there is some problem, say, internally within your body,

98
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:46,040
all the cells which are needed to correct that problem will rush.

99
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,560
The blood will rush. The heart will pump.

100
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,400
Everything will work out in a very co-coordinated way,

101
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,320
but nobody feels hurt.

102
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,680
that “Why should I take help from anyone?”.

103
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,680
Neither the one who helps is frightened or afraid

104
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,440
or also feels the ego.

105
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,800
The reason is, the cells of the body

106
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,640
are under the complete control of one brain,

107
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:22,240
or one personality, or one Self.

108
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:31,320
But in Sahaja Yoga, this collectivity is not yet established.

109
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:38,720
That’s why people feel hurt, people hurt each other.

110
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:46,480
They have fear

111
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,920
of another ‘cell’, which is the brother ‘cell’,

112
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,880
witch is the partner ‘cell’,

113
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,160
which is the part and parcel of your own being.

114
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,160
Are we afraid of our eyes? Or afraid of our nose?

115
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:06,360
Are we afraid of our hands, or of our feet?

116
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,800
And this collectivity is such a vicious circle

117
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,880
that unless and until you become really collective,

118
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,720
you cannot feel another person.

119
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,920
And unless and until you have that sense of responsibility

120
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,560
of collectivity built in yourself,

121
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,000
you cannot help another person.

122
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,400
So certain amount of growth is needed in the whole body

123
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,200
to be sensitive enough to help each other,

124
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,640
to be wise enough to help each other,

125
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:51,480
to be resourceful enough to really nourish another.

126
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,040
And that development has to come again through collectivity;

127
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,800
is most surprising.

128
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:08,520
I know sometimes people feel that there are Sahaja Yogis

129
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,160
who are not even of one mind.

130
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,320
I agree.

131
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,800
That somebody will say, “Your Vishuddhi is catching,”

132
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,440
another will say, “Your heart is catching.” Another will say,

133
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,240
“Your void is catching.”

134
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,480
They don’t say that all of them will say the same thing.

135
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,240
One will say this, one will say that, one will say that.

136
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,680
The reason is, some of them have developed

137
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,400
certain sensitivity to a certain centre,

138
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,760
but not to all the centres.

139
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,880
And that’s how there can be

140
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:51,160
a difference of opinion as there should not be at all.

141
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:57,160
So firstly we must all know that we are still growing.

142
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,480
We have to still grow.

143
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,320
In Sahaja Yoga even if you get your Realization, that doesn’t mean

144
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,960
you have suddenly become John the Baptist.

145
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,360
We all have to grow.

146
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:17,480
And for growing and growth we have to discard something

147
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,040
and we have to accept something.

148
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,880
And the best thing that should be discarded is your ego,

149
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,720
and it comes in so many ways

150
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:42,080
that it creates a barrier between you and your Creator.

151
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,000
Sometimes this ego can take you to anti-God activities

152
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,160
and you will not know that it is your ego is taking down there,

153
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,400
because the identification with ego has been,

154
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:57,320
not in this life, but in many lives before also.

155
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:05,560
So to get misidentified, or we can say, to get dissolved

156
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:13,160
or, this ego, or to get away from this ego

157
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,240
is a difficult thing.

158
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,720
But as you grow out of the mud of this ego,

159
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:27,040
the lotus starts becoming fragrant

160
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,840
and everybody can see that fragrance.

161
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,080
It is more difficult in the Western countries, than in the Eastern.

162
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,800
Because the whole basis of the growth in the West

163
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,720
has been so far based on ego and competition.

164
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,920
There is no competition in Sahaja Yoga.

165
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,040
You just think, if one finger starts competing

166
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,960
with another finger, what will happen?

167
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,160
It is as absurd as that.

168
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,920
Now we are talking of roots.

169
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:17,200
We are not talking of the shoot, what people have achieved

170
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:21,160
through Western style of thinking.

171
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,600
Now we have to go deep down into the roots,

172
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,240
so we must change our methods.

173
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,760
There is no competition at all among roots.

174
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:40,720
They help each other. If one fails, another goes and helps .

175
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:46,360
That is how this living process can work out.

176
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:53,480
We have to change our ways of tackling ourselves and others,

177
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:02,720
and we have to realize, that God’s Power of Love

178
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:08,240
is the highest, deepest and the mightiest.

179
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,960
And this is the power of love that we have to assert.

180
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,200
But love just does not mean that you spoil someone

181
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,960
or tell lies just to please someone.

182
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,760
It may not be pleasing, in the beginning maybe,

183
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,840
but ultimately it will be.

184
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:36,360
So when we, you have to talk to someone,

185
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,440
of course, you need not be arrogant or rude at all,

186
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:46,840
should be sweet, you should be kind, compassionate,

187
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,520
but it’s not diplomacy going on there.

188
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,720
It’s not any that you are trying

189
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,200
to get out some votes from that person.

190
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:03,240
It’s a guideline you are giving to the person.

191
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:08,320
And the guideline can be even silent.

192
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:15,240
The greatest guideline for anyone is

193
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,720
the precepts that you follow,

194
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,440
the ideals you have, the way you behave.

195
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,920
You know in India one person

196
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,760
gave Realization to ten thousand people.

197
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:39,440
And how he did it, how he impressed others.

198
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:49,320
He impressed others because he went to an office,

199
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,800
a commissioner's office, for some, his personal work,

200
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,280
and then he started talking

201
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,640
in such a manner that they couldn’t understand

202
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:11,320
that this man has come for some practical,

203
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,640
every day-to-day stuff, and the way he’s talking,

204
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:20,480
the way he’s behaving, the way he’s dignified,

205
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,600
and so firm,

206
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:33,880
how is he managing that? So they said, “Who is your guru?”

207
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,040
Immediately it came into their head

208
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,360
“Must be some good gurus here they have.”

209
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,600
He said, “I have no guru,

210
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,880
I’ve only a Mother.” He said, “We all have.”

211
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,280
That’s how it started.

212
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,040
So one must

213
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:00,400
know that, by your own behaviour,

214
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,400
you can talk to another person.

215
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:12,560
and that behaviour should not be superficial,

216
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,840
must be coming from the heart, the concern within,

217
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,760
the concern that this person should be all right.

218
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,320
Genuine concern.

219
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:30,000
And even a dog knows that, you don’t have to tell anybody

220
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,440
by taking some sort of a vow,

221
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,440
but even a dog knows what is a genuine concern

222
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,560
and what is not a genuine concern.

223
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:44,520
With that concern you have to talk.

224
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,040
And that is what we lack

225
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:54,040
is the genuineness within ourselves, our heart is not open.

226
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,360
Open your hearts.

227
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:01,560
Now you have entered into the Kingdom of God. Open your hearts!

228
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:06,320
Just see yourself. Why have you got fear? For what?

229
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,160
Ultimately what is going to happen?

230
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,080
We are all going to die, isn’t it?

231
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,680
So put that, fix that point, "we are going to die",

232
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:21,280
whether a tiger eats us, or we jump from anywhere.

233
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:26,040
Something has to happen to us to die.

234
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:31,040
So why should there be any fear?

235
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,720
Now if there could be a genuine fear, is this,

236
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:40,160
that you may not receive your Realization.

237
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,960
Even this genuine fear has no meaning

238
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:51,800
because this will also kill your chances of Realization.

239
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,000
You should believe that God is great

240
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,560
and that His compassion is great,

241
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,960
really from your heart. You’ll get your Realization no doubt.

242
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,400
You all are there for that and

243
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:17,000
the Divine Power itself is anxious to do it, extremely anxious.

244
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,040
You can see. Can you believe that there are

245
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:25,080
so many people who are realised souls today in this London?

246
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:31,760
I came here about twenty years back and if somebody had told Me

247
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:37,240
that there are going to be so many realised souls, here, in this

248
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,080
place, I would never have believed,

249
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,520
because at that time I had met very few,

250
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,360
in the whole world I would say.

251
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:52,400
So the things are happening, but be patient!

252
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,480
And believe

253
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,160
in the mercy of God, in the kindness of God, in His compassion,

254
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,680
in His anxiety

255
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:10,800
to give you this gift of Realization.

256
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:17,200
And this is one of the greatest hindrances people have,

257
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:22,040
when they do not feel their vibrations.

258
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,400
Today I received a letter from Gill

259
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,400
and she said she went with My photograph to be framed

260
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,960
or something, in a shop.

261
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:47,640
And the shopkeeper, that lady, she looked at the photograph,

262
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:53,160
she was little bit, I don’t know, concerned.

263
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,040
A+nd she said, “Who’s photograph is this?”

264
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,040
So Gill just said that,  “You put your hands towards it.”

265
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,560
“Oh God, what has happened? As if some door has opened.”

266
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,320
Just she put hands there and she gets that.

267
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:13,120
And Gill was amazed, because six months she never felt anything!

268
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,240
She was breaking her head with it,

269
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,960
“Mother, I never feel cool breeze, I never feel cool breeze.”

270
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,160
But she is a great seeker no doubt.

271
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:32,400
And now, she says that her brother came

272
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,400
and he didn’t feel the cool breeze.

273
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,240
So Gill said, “You have a bad liver,”

274
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,000
“Yes, yes, How do you know? I have.

275
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,240
I’ve got pain in the liver. I’ve had problems with the liver.”

276
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,160
So Gill said, “Put your hands towards the photograph

277
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,560
and put your left hand on the liver.”

278
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,400
“Oh God, I am feeling this,

279
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,800
and I’m feeling the tingling ”

280
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,800
and this and that, and he showed the finger for the liver.

281
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:04,160
And she was amazed that this gentlemen just walks into the shop

282
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,160
where are so many people are coming, going,

283
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,160
no Caxton Hall,

284
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,320
no peaceful atmosphere, no other Sahaja Yogis sitting there,

285
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,840
and suddenly you find

286
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,800
this gentleman feels the cool breeze.

287
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,080
Not only that, but he can exactly say where he’s catching.

288
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:32,400
Nothing happened, no trembling in the hands, no shaking, no burning.

289
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:38,640
And he felt better on the liver.

290
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:44,400
She couldn’t understand what was the reason.

291
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:49,320
The reason is very simple.

292
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:53,800
When you come for a program

293
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:58,720
there are many others who are already feeling vibrations.

294
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,160
And you don’t feel it. It’s like, you see,

295
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,560
they have a property and you don’t have sort of a thing.

296
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:13,360
So your mind, which has worked through competition,

297
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,600
mind which has worked

298
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,560
through realising that, “Somebody has something. I don’t have”,

299
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,240
have-s and have not-s, you see,

300
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,120
that mind starts putting fear into your head

301
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,760
“Oh God, will you have it or not?

302
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,240
Will I get it? Or even if I get it, will I lose it?”

303
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,000
And that fear I see on the faces of many new people.

304
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,840
Give up that fear!

305
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:49,560
You are all going to get your Realization. Give up that fear!

306
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:58,600
You have not entered into any competition here. Just to relax.

307
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,320
Just relax now!

308
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:11,720
Then the more you want to do about Sahaja Yoga,

309
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:16,000
again you are tensed.

310
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,000
“I have to meditate early in the morning;

311
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,840
I have to get up tomorrow early in the morning,”

312
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:23,440
you see, you go on pestering yourself. Whole night you won’t sleep,

313
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,360
and when you are meditating you are dozing.

314
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,760
Relax!

315
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,360
God is looking after you, believe Me!

316
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,840
He is going to give you Realization

317
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,160
and He is going to look after you,

318
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:44,400
and He is going to wake you up in the morning too. But relax!

319
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:50,240
The first idea that “I can do it” is wrong.

320
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,160
He has to do it.

321
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,000
It’s not working out because you think you can do it.

322
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:03,560
If you can come to this conclusion that

323
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:09,280
“I cannot do it, it is His mercy, His graciousness has to work out.”

324
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:18,800
But, after Realization,

325
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:25,880
you have to do something, in the sense you have to desire.

326
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,160
But when I say you have to desire it, again you will say,

327
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,280
“All right. Now I’m going to sit down here

328
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,320
and nail myself to this place

329
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,520
and I’m going to sit down and desire it!”

330
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,040
This desire is a dead desire, you see,

331
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,760
just pushed onto your head that,

332
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:48,800
"Oh, I must desire! Mother has told I must desire.”

333
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:54,880
You have to be hungry.

334
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,040
You don’t say that “I have to desire that I have to be hungry,”

335
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,240
do you?

336
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:07,560
The hunger is from within, which is there, no doubt,

337
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,880
but is clouded.

338
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:15,240
The hunger is clouded

339
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:21,240
because you have fear.

340
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:28,120
If you put a goat before a tiger

341
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,440
and give him to eat,

342
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:35,080
he will reduce with that, eating whatever it is,

343
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,720
because it has that fear,

344
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,760
that there is a tiger which is going to eat me.

345
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:45,160
So first kill all the imaginary tigers around you.

346
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,000
Again we come back to the same

347
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:53,400
that desire must come from within.

348
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:59,720
And it is there, but is clouded.

349
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,360
Relax!

350
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:11,240
It should not be that “I’m very relaxed!”

351
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,320
It’s childlike. It’s simple.

352
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:25,720
A relaxed person is just like a child.

353
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,720
So not to get frantic.

354
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,880
Try to relax.

355
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,120
That’s all. For everyone.

356
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,920
But relaxation never means that you are inactive.

357
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:56,800
On the contrary, the person who is relaxed is extremely active

358
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:03,080
on the exterior, but inside is absolutely silent,

359
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:11,240
absolutely relaxed and at ease. Outside you may feel.

360
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:15,920
As you know now, at this time, tremendous vibrations are flowing.

361
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:23,120
And I can see the flow, tremendous.

362
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:29,040
And all the chakras are doing like this, around Me.

363
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:33,160
But I see them and their play.

364
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,840
At the most I may stop talking,

365
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,600
but it is flowing.

366
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,040
So whether

367
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,920
it is for the seeking

368
00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:00,240
or for anything else in the world, the first thing is

369
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:06,960
that you must take an attitude of a relaxed witness

370
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:16,480
If you can do that, then those who are not feeling vibrations

371
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,320
will definitely feel.

372
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,960
I have see people on whom I’ve been working,

373
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,720
and it wouldn’t work out.

374
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,320
Of course they were not rude or not even arrogant,

375
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,440
but felt very sad that they couldn’t get the vibrations.

376
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:36,080
So I said, “All right, today you go and

377
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,800
enjoy the flowers in a garden,

378
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,680
enjoy the birds and talk to the sky, and come back tomorrow.”

379
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,120
It works out.

380
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:52,880
Because you have been always like this.

381
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:59,320
In Sahaja Yoga you don’t have to achieve anything,

382
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,880
you become.

383
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:12,360
First you become and then mentally you understand Sahaja Yoga.

384
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:17,160
But those who try to understand Sahaja Yoga mentally first

385
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:21,920
are really in for trouble.

386
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,160
Because when you read it,

387
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:30,640
it sounds so great and you think, “Oh God, where am I?”

388
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,000
So please, if you give Realization to someone, take it easy.

389
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,080
It will grow.

390
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,840
Don’t give ‘Advent’ to read, next moment.

391
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:54,600
We do it! Why? We think we should impress the person that

392
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,560
Sahaja Yoga is a great thing and the person must read ‘The Advent’

393
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,560
so he’ll come to Sahaja Yoga and we’ll establish this man

394
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,920
because he will see and will be impressed.

395
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,000
If somebody is going to be impressed by these things,

396
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,600
such a person is of no use for Sahaja Yoga, take it from Me.

397
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,840
If they are going to be impressed by something

398
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,800
exterior and superficial,

399
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:29,000
how far will they go?

400
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:35,320
They have to achieve it within themselves, their own Spirit.

401
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,560
They have to be impressed by themselves,

402
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,640
by their own achievements.

403
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,400
If you understand this simple principle

404
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:58,440
that, when we become the Spirit,

405
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,760
we manifest a power

406
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:07,720
which is just the opposite of any other so-called powers.

407
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:23,000
Like, you take science, it will analyse.

408
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,840
Sahaja Yoga will synthesise.

409
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:34,640
Take philosophy, so-called,

410
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,680
it will try to find out the dogmas.

411
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:48,120
Sahaja Yoga will neutralise all barriers of all the religions.

412
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:59,000
Because all these forces are deadening, they deaden.

413
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,800
The religion is deadened, God is deadened,

414
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,280
everything is deadened by that.

415
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,360
While Sahaja Yoga is a living force within you,

416
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:13,200
and that’s how

417
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:18,520
it neutralises all that is destructive, all that is deadening.

418
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:29,720
It’s a living force of God, is a very powerful force,

419
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,760
It's very wise, it understands everything.

420
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,880
We have heard about it,

421
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:42,200
but we never believe there could be such a force.

422
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,640
And the first time we feel that force,

423
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,360
we don’t want to believe it, “How can that be?”.

424
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,360
Because we still don’t believe that we can be

425
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,000
the source of that force,

426
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,440
which is integrating,

427
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:07,000
which is synthesising completely,

428
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,960
which nourishes, which helps you,

429
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:20,240
to rise above falsehood to Reality.

430
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,880
It doesn’t allow any falsehood to build in.

431
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:27,280
While all other forces, whatever you try,

432
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:32,360
political forces, based on falsehood, absolute falsehood.

433
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,400
All politics is based on falsehood.

434
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,960
We can see that.

435
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:46,640
How can you explain the policies of these nations?

436
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,720
You just don’t understand.

437
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:57,400
All falsehood. Your democracy is ‘demonocracy’.

438
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:03,680
Your communism, I don’t know what sort of a thing it is.

439
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:09,520
All absurd, perverted and false.

440
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,160
But in Reality you are a communist, you are a democratic person,

441
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:21,760
everything within yourself is the Spirit.

442
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,120
But to become the Spirit,

443
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,800
if you stand on falsehood and want to achieve it, you cannot.

444
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,800
Give up all that! Become the Spirit.

445
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:40,680
Then you start seeing from the window of the Spirit

446
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,440
everything is different.

447
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,760
So the falsehood that we have accepted throughout

448
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,760
stops your vibrations.

449
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:03,640
All this is falsehood, believe Me.

450
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:09,760
The truth is God’s love. That’s the only truth there is.

451
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:15,680
That’s why I say that "God is love, and He is truth".

452
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,600
The rest is all falsehood and if you believe

453
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,520
in this principle to begin with,

454
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,920
really, from the heart,

455
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,800
then this power starts flowing through you.

456
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:40,240
It’s the most powerful thing, universal thing,

457
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,800
which is doing thousands and thousands of things of

458
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,320
making these beautiful flowers, fragrant flowers,

459
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,720
our heart beating, creating human beings, animals,

460
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:58,080
everything is done through this living power.

461
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:06,320
And this living power just has to flow through you,

462
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,600
and believe Me that human beings,

463
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:14,600
are the only instruments of that power.

464
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:22,360
Some people think of compassion

465
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,960
and think that they must help other people.

466
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:31,640
That’s falsehood! You can’t help.

467
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,760
You help on a superficial basis.

468
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:41,960
The only help one can give to another

469
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,960
is when you become part and parcel of that

470
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:50,760
Great Being and realise that other ‘cells’ are also there,

471
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:56,000
who are awakened or may be awakened.

472
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:59,520
That’s the real help, that’s the real compassion,

473
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,680
that’s real happening.

474
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:11,440
Sahaja Yoga is definitely,

475
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:17,240
is the deep understanding of this fact.

476
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:24,960
We indulge into activities

477
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,560
which are superficial and could be anti-God, as I told you.

478
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,160
But for Sahaja Yoga

479
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:38,240
the activities are extremely simple.

480
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,960
Even a finger movement, like that, is sufficient

481
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,640
to do tremendous things.

482
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:54,240
There’s no need to stand on your head for it.

483
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:00,840
Awakening is your own.

484
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,560
There’s no problem on that.

485
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,160
The problem is,

486
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,920
to prepare yourself for that awakening

487
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:12,080
by not preparing yourself.

488
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,720
Be unprepared!

489
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:19,560
Be simple!

490
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:27,800
Just be simple people. Be childlike.

491
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:37,320
Just that. Which is such a difficult thing, to be simple.

492
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,320
No elaborations are needed,

493
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,440
nothing is needed for that,

494
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:55,280
no preparations as such,

495
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:03,160
except open your heart. Now how will you open? Like that?

496
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:10,160
Pay attention to your heart, just pay attention to your heart.

497
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:14,600
You’ll be amazed, it will start melting.

498
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,760
Just melt your heart.

499
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:22,520
The thawing starts as soon as you pay attention to it.

500
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:29,320
Tensions will drop off

501
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,840
and you will feel cool breeze.

502
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,480
So those Sahaja Yogis who came to Sahaja Yoga

503
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,280
and didn’t feel vibrations,

504
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,320
should know that the fear that they have…

505
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:51,640
Everybody thinks there’s a show on, like a dog show,

506
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:55,560
like other shows, you see.

507
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,240
And they come with that idea.

508
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,600
There’s no show on.

509
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:07,160
It’s a thing that you have to achieve yourself,

510
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:10,760
which you achieve that state, automatically.

511
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,960
Now this is about the Sahaja Yogis

512
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:18,320
who feel that they do not feel any vibrations.

513
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,680
Maybe sometimes it happens also in some places also,

514
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,320
where the Vishuddhi Chakra is very bad,

515
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,160
you don’t feel any cool breeze.

516
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:31,040
So doesn’t matter! As long as you feel peaceful, enjoy that!

517
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,360
Why worry about the vibrations? I don’t understand.

518
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,160
What is the need?

519
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,240
If it is not there, well and good.

520
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:45,960
As long as you feel the peace of your Spirit.

521
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,720
You just put your hands to another person.

522
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,200
I remember one gentleman in India always used to say,

523
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,680
“Mother, I don’t feel anything, I don’t feel anything.

524
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:02,760
I’ve done that, done this.”

525
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:07,360
I said, “Thank God you don’t feel  it.”

526
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:12,440
He said, “Why do you say that, Mother?” I said, “Enjoy your peace!

527
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,520
Enjoy it!”

528
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,240
But then he wouldn’t listen so I said,

529
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,640
“All right, go and feel the vibrations of a particular gentleman!”

530
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:25,560
And he got blisters on all his five fingers!

531
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,520
And he came to Me and said, “Bad, oh, Ma!”

532
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:35,480
I said, “You wanted to feel, now have the blisters! What can I do?”

533
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,920
So those who do not feel, also are avoiding

534
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,240
little problems for the time being!

535
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:48,240
Take it easy! It's a very good word  "Take it easy!",

536
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,400
which is, you know, this word has come very recently.

537
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,560
It was not there, never.

538
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:58,240
It was"‘Run! Run! Run!" before. Now everybody says ‘Take it easy!’

539
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,720
Specially if you have been to some other gurus

540
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,440
and some other ‘meditation’ centres and all that,

541
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:09,400
where you have been jumping morning till evening, you see,

542
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:14,160
you don’t want to believe that Sahaja Yoga you get,

543
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:17,320
only by sitting quietly.

544
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:30,760
Now there are ways and methods for improving your vibrations.

545
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:37,440
As you know in Sahaja Yoga they are all described.

546
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:42,440
For people who suffer from ego,

547
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:45,600
I think best thing is

548
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:49,920
to put your hands into the ice, right hand, maybe.

549
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:54,200
It may work out. Try it!

550
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:57,360
But don’t prepare.

551
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:00,400
Just push your hands into ice sometimes.

552
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:03,440
It may work out.

553
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,760
And for people who suffer from superego,

554
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:12,000
little bit burning your hand on the candle may help.

555
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:16,600
Just try! Because the hands are not sensitive.

556
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:20,760
So there is a heat or a cool too much.

557
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:24,080
Either you are a frozen personality or you are a heated personality,

558
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,120
you are not in the centre.

559
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:30,160
So if you are a frozen personality, better melt it a little bit,

560
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,160
Try! I never said this before because

561
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:36,400
half of you would have run away if I had said this.

562
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:41,000
But don’t burn it to have blisters I am saying!

563
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:47,400
Just a little bit, try to see that, if you burn your finger

564
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,240
the sensitivity will improve.

565
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,360
But someone is thinking just now,

566
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:56,840
that if you have both the problems, what do you do?

567
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:04,280
There are permutations and combinations.

568
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:07,480
Because if you get out of your ego

569
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,360
you have a big superego that comes up,

570
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:14,520
and if you get after your superego the ego comes up.

571
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:21,960
That case, the attention has to be brought here.

572
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:27,240
And sahaja yogis know what it is, here to put the attention here.

573
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:31,760
If you can keep your attention here, then you are above this,

574
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,480
and if something drops out it drops out forever

575
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,720
because you are standing here.

576
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,960
Say if I have a shawl,

577
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,880
and somehow I can jump on to that gallery

578
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,400
and this shawl falls off, then I never have it, isn’t it?

579
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:52,400
Because I’m there,  and the shawl is down below.

580
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:58,360
So the ascent must take place.

581
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:02,640
If you do not ascend…

582
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:07,320
How do you ascend is through your attention.

583
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:11,160
Where is your attention?

584
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:17,400
Ask yourself, “Where is my attention?”

585
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:23,320
Either you are counting your money, counting your votes

586
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:30,240
or some people even count lamp posts I am told!

587
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:35,760
If they have nothing to do they can go on doing whatever they like.

588
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,920
But count your blessings!

589
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:45,880
Count your blessings!

590
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,080
And your ascent will start. Count your blessings.

591
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,160
And that is how you ascend,

592
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:02,440
ascend in the Realm of God.

593
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:09,320
If there is no ascent,

594
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:12,360
then you’ll move from left to right, right to left,

595
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,960
you will be wobbly person.

596
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:22,720
But count your blessings with your heart. Feel it!

597
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:25,960
The thankfulness. English language is very good,

598
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:28,080
you say "Thank you".

599
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:31,280
Now Indian languag is also, you see, we translated it,

600
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:35,560
to say "Thank you". But we don’t say "Thank you".

601
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:39,200
Because what is there to say with the mouth?

602
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:47,160
Normally there are no words for thanking,

603
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:53,760
because how can you say this if you are feeling from the heart?

604
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,960
Even a glance,

605
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:04,960
even a tint in the eye, glint in the eye, can express that.

606
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,760
Just a smile,

607
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:12,560
just a bending of your head.

608
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:17,240
There’s nothing to be said,

609
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:22,600
to feel the gratefulness and thankfulness

610
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,800
for the great blessings of God.

611
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:31,080
But if you read newspapers every day, you’ll forget this mantra.

612
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:33,800
Because when you read newspapers you think,

613
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:37,640
"What a curse it is! God is a curse on this earth!”

614
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:41,680
or that,“ He has put His curse on me

615
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:44,880
and I am the persecuted animal.”

616
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:58,080
For ascent it’s not a mental procedure,

617
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:03,200
it’s a procedure of the heart which is thanksgiving.

618
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:08,000
Look at the flowers,

619
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:12,760
they are giving thanks to God.

620
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:16,080
The whole being is nothing but thanksgiving.

621
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,600
Not worried, they are being plucked,

622
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,120
they will die tomorrow - not worried.

623
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:25,960
As long as they live it’s giving thanks.

624
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,760
Look at everything.

625
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:32,960
Look at this candle. What is it? Is thanksgiving.

626
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:39,520
Everything that is created is giving thanks.

627
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:46,080
What about us human beings?

628
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:53,800
We say, because we can say it. They cannot say.

629
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:02,760
It doesn’t have words to say.

630
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:07,720
We have language, that’s how we have become superficial.

631
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:13,360
We have lost our depth because we have language.

632
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:17,480
There is no language

633
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:22,160
for the silent expression.

634
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:27,680
So those who do not feel Realization,

635
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:31,240
should be thankful to God

636
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,200
that, at least they desire it,

637
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,840
that they are seekers,

638
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:42,840
that they are seeking God. How many there are?

639
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:45,760
Today when I was coming to Caxton Hall,

640
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:49,280
I found people walking with their tailcoats and

641
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:52,960
so many, seriously, you know, all of them. Bow ties!

642
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:59,000
How many are seekers in this world?

643
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:02,920
How many are seeking God?

644
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:06,920
How many are seeking higher life?

645
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:12,160
So be thankful that you are seekers,

646
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:18,120
that you have felt the need of God’s love,

647
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:24,640
that you do not want anything

648
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:28,840
that is not God. It’s such a great thing,

649
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:35,480
that you have a heart, you have a mind that desires the Highest.

650
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:42,760
Be thankful that you are seekers and born in this great time

651
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:46,520
where you have to get your Realization. Be thankful.

652
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:50,560
I know you have committed mistakes. All right, doesn’t matter!

653
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:54,840
In your seeking, you have committed mistakes, doesn’t matter.

654
00:56:55,680 --> 00:57:01,880
But be thankful that God is looking after you.

655
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:08,880
You are the special people created by His love, guided by Him.

656
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:14,680
So be thankful.

657
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:20,600
And thankfulness is a quality of heart.

658
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:27,080
That’s how, when you feel the beauty of thankfulness,

659
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:31,880
then you start feeling the Spirit within you.

660
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:39,760
It cannot be expressed,

661
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:45,920
it cannot be returned, it can only be enjoyed.

662
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:52,920
The blessings can only be enjoyed, isn’t it?

663
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:56,320
And it is for enjoyment only,

664
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:59,000
it’s not for anything else.

665
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:01,120
Just that you should enjoy the blessings,

666
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:03,760
that’s why the blessings are there.

667
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:08,880
So to achieve the blessings, is not the point.

668
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:11,400
Blessings are everywhere, or I would say,

669
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:15,480
there are tremendous vibrations today in Caxton Hall.

670
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:19,720
And now some of you are not feeling it, that doesn’t mean

671
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:24,840
that God has not accepted you, that doesn’t mean that.

672
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:31,480
It only means you have to turn your face a little bit this side.

673
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:37,760
Nobody should feel higher because they are feeling vibrations

674
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:42,560
or nobody should feel lower because they are not feeling vibrations.

675
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:51,520
But if somebody tries to help you, don’t feel bad.

676
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:02,760
Now all of you who are going to look after the new people here,

677
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:10,520
must know that, again, it’s God’s blessings that you are here,

678
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:15,520
that you have this great work to be done,

679
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:19,760
that you are now employed by God,

680
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:23,280
and He has given you this special job,

681
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,600
to give Realization to people.

682
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:30,640
Again, count your blessings.

683
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:33,400
Don’t feel depressed. Some people say,

684
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:36,800
“Mother, now you are going and they are all going with you.”

685
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:39,040
God knows why I’m taking them there.

686
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:42,160
Perhaps, they need more training than you do.

687
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:52,720
But again the competitiveness comes in.

688
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:57,080
Some have to be in the reserve force, as they say.

689
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:01,040
But where am I going?

690
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:08,040
And that is how, in both ways, we have to count our blessings.

691
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,720
That you are going or not going, is not the point.

692
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:18,680
Both of you have a responsibility

693
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:23,240
which is bestowed upon you as a blessing from God.

694
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:32,800
If the attitude towards Sahaja Yoga becomes

695
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:38,160
of a child who expects everything from God,

696
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:40,960
because he’s the child of God.

697
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:44,280
What’s wrong? It’s no ego.

698
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,320
Because if God is Almighty,

699
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:49,440
He jolly will have to look after you, isn’t it?

700
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:56,080
But we are not like children you know, that’s the reason.

701
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:00,720
A child will demand.

702
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:05,360
But you must have that faith,

703
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:09,440
that, whatever you demand, He will do it.

704
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:11,920
I don’t know if you have forgotten a story

705
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:14,560
I used to tell long time back,

706
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:18,160
what My grandmother told Me once upon a time….

707
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:21,960
Here, here. Come, come!

708
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:25,800
What do you want? You want this? All right, have it.

709
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:31,520
No? You want chana? Ha! Have it.

710
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:35,120
Chana? No? Then a kiss?

711
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:39,920
Come, come, give me a kiss.

712
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:41,680
Come along.

713
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,440
No? All right.

714
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,360
Give this to mummy. Come along, give this to mummy.

715
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:54,800
Responsibility.

716
01:01:56,680 --> 01:02:03,880
They like it, they like it.You must watch them.

717
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:09,440
All right. Now, what do you want?

718
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:14,600
You want flowers?  No? All right. You give it to them.

719
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:18,360
Give it to them. Give it to them. Give it to them.

720
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:23,080
Not for himself but for others.

721
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:27,040
Give it.

722
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:31,240
This is Godsend.

723
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:35,360
How children explain things so in a, such a simple way.

724
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:41,280
We cannot be like children. We are very grown-ups, you see.

725
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,800
First give me a kiss.

726
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:56,240
Now, put your hand like that.

727
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:02,800
Oh, it's fallen.

728
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:21,800
Today really I don’t know what to say.

729
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:24,840
You better ask Me some questions.

730
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:30,680
All right . Give it to others.

731
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:41,880
Any other questions please?

732
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:50,440
Mother,  I am hearing about that you suggested

733
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:53,840
that we have a day without food and a night without sleep.

734
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:55,720
Come here, I can’t hear you.

735
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:58,480
Today the vibrations are just blowing in My ears.

736
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:01,560
Come here. What did you say it is that...

737
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:06,880
You suggested to us that we have a day without food

738
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:08,600
and a night without sleep each week.

739
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:12,240
One night. Good idea, better try!

740
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:14,160
So we’ve been doing it four weeks.

741
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:15,480
It helped you?

742
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:17,440
Yes, I don’t mind the days without food  but

743
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:20,120
when I have the days without sleep I find that,

744
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:22,560
really like now, I can hardly keep awake in the evening.

745
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:25,480
I don’t think if it’s really very good to continue it every week.

746
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:30,200
I think every day you must sleep early, is a good idea.

747
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:34,200
It’s not nice to keep awake in the night.

748
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:36,480
Night time is not very good.

749
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:42,720
And, why I said to keep awake in the night was that,

750
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:48,360
because what I find, that Sahaja Yogis, have more problem

751
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:51,760
of the left-side.

752
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:55,880
For the left-side people it is important

753
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:59,080
that they should keep awake in the night,

754
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:02,120
and lots of things work out.

755
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:06,360
Because you are alert. In the night only these attacks come.

756
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:09,920
Left-sided people get all their attacks in the night,

757
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:13,600
and right-sided people get all their attacks in the daytime.

758
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:18,440
So for the people who are night left-sided,

759
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:21,520
in your case, specially, you are left-sided,

760
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,040
so what you have to do,

761
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:28,280
so what you have to do,

762
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:35,440
what you have to do is to sleep less in the night.

763
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:39,600
You can sleep in the daytime, I don’t mind.

764
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:44,960
Sometimes you can do it, now do it on a Saturday or a Sunday.

765
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:48,480
Otherwise, this left side won’t come up.

766
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:51,000
Because we have to try and experiment you know.

767
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:54,240
Would You say something about the timing because for example

768
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:57,000
to keep awake from say 12 o’clock to 4 is very easy for me

769
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,760
the other night I stayed awake from 12 to 6.30.

770
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:01,400
The other way round I would say.

771
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:02,640
And what is that?

772
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:05,400
You get up at 12 o’clock, that’s better.

773
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:07,280
Yes I did that.

774
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:09,200
Yes, that's all right. That's all right.

775
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:11,320
Then if you are awake from 12 to 6,

776
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:13,800
and then can you rest for an hour before you go to work?

777
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,720
No, no. It’s all your lookout.

778
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,840
And there’s no compulsion in Sahaja Yoga.

779
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:21,000
You experiment with it, see whatever suits you.

780
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:24,200
And you will be able to see yourself. You have to experiment.

781
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:27,840
You see, every individual has their individual problems,

782
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:30,000
and this is one of them. One has to see that,

783
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:31,920
if you are a left-sided person,

784
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:36,200
is to keep awake before 12 o’clock is better.

785
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:38,960
Afterwards, gradually if you sleep,

786
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:42,640
you see, all these left-sided problems will disappear.

787
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:47,680
But the right-sided problems start in the morning time.

788
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:51,080
You see, “I have to go, I have to catch the bus,

789
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:55,120
I have to take this”, plan it, plan it, plan it.

790
01:06:56,240 --> 01:07:00,360
So that time if you at least don’t eat, you get more time.

791
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:06,320
You get more time and apart from that,

792
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:10,240
your stomach, which is active less,  is better off.

793
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:14,200
I also don’t mind about eating at all. I don't mind about eating so.

794
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:17,320
If, You want us to do it every week then, one night?

795
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:18,760
No, no, you have to experiment.

796
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,560
There’s nothing like that in Sahaja Yoga,

797
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:22,440
as you know it is not compulsory.

798
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:24,960
But if it helps you, the way it helps you, try.

799
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:27,800
I mean, I am saying that doesn’t mean now all of you should buy

800
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:29,760
a bucket of ice and put your hands into it.

801
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:31,600
You see this is the trouble with human beings,

802
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:33,280
you tell them anything and you'll find them

803
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:34,960
sitting with a bucket in their hand.

804
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:37,680
No, I’m just saying ‘try’.

805
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:42,440
You see, because, you must know, I have no problems.

806
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:50,360
All right?

807
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:03,760
You are all individuals, you are all professionals,

808
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:06,320
you are research scholars.

809
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:10,640
Keep your mind open

810
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:13,520
and try and find out if it helps you.

811
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:17,360
Every individual has individual problems.

812
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:22,760
All these little, little problems you can solve yourself,

813
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:25,360
because you have the light.

814
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:28,360
You have the light of vibrations,

815
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:32,320
the Spirit is with you, so you are independent.

816
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:35,200
I just give you guidelines.

817
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:38,240
That doesn’t mean that you everyday have a vision.

818
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:40,480
No, horrible it is!

819
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,480
But it has helped some people.

820
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:48,960
May not be for everyone, this may suit or may not suit.

821
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:52,800
But for left-sided people is better, I have seen.

822
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:58,960
With the right-sided people it suits better

823
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:02,600
that they don’t eat so much,

824
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:06,600
or  their attention

825
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:14,080
is more towards better things of life.

826
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:18,480
Actually I don’t think right-sided people eat much.

827
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:21,680
On the contrary they are very fussy people about food.

828
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:24,000
I mean the whole thing is a mental thing.

829
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:26,320
Mentally they will say,

830
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:30,560
“That’s not  good, I don’t like it, what will I have it?”

831
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:34,560
You go to a party and the menu card will come

832
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:38,120
and seriously they’ll think it ten times what they will eat.

833
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:42,040
I mean what difference does it make what you eat? Does it?

834
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:46,840
And they’ll all discuss, “What will I have?”

835
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:50,920
and they’ll eat two morsels and finish it off.

836
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:53,440
They’ll not finish even that!

837
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:57,360
Because food cannot be enjoyed by mental activity

838
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:59,360
– simple thing as that.

839
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:01,960
The tongue has to enjoy,

840
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:05,800
but all your energy has been spent in your mental activity

841
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,320
so tongue is not there anymore to enjoy.

842
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:14,600
So, towards food also, anything, if your attention is too much

843
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:15,760
reduce it.

844
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:18,560
And that’s why I said, “Eat less!”

845
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:22,160
Or if you fast you don’t have to think about food.

846
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:25,440
You think more about food than eat!

847
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:29,440
And enjoy less. Least of all.

848
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:35,520
That’s why it is said ‘fasting’, but when I say 'fasting',

849
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:40,920
people start thinking, “Then what time should I eat Mother exactly?"

850
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:44,520
Is it alright at 8.30 or say 8 o’clock?”

851
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:51,360
As if there is a jail in Sahaja Yoga!

852
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:54,720
Eat at any time you feel like.

853
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:59,080
But if you are thinking about food what’s the use of fasting?

854
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:01,000
Like in India, we have fasting, you see,

855
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:04,680
women start planning about the fasting ten days ahead,

856
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:07,600
“What will you have for your fasting?”

857
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:11,480
See, because in Indian life, people have made some concessions

858
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:15,000
that if you eat this, this is not fasting, that is  fasting!

859
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:19,520
So then they'll plan out, what they are going to eat.

860
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:24,400
And they accumulate everything, you know,

861
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:26,560
all that is to be eaten because you are fasting.

862
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:29,680
The whole attention is on ‘fasting’ only.

863
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:33,440
And actually you are eating all the time .

864
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:36,760
Like this have Ramadan, Muslims have.

865
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:39,120
They are supposed to eat early in the morning.

866
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:42,840
But they eat so much in those days that they never eat,

867
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:45,960
because they know that they are not going to eat later on.

868
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:48,640
So it’s a funny situation.

869
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:53,040
You see I’m just giving you it as a research scholar

870
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:59,440
to find out about yourself, what type of life will suit you.

871
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:07,720
Any other question?

872
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:16,200
Mother, what was the end of the story about your grandmother?

873
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:19,560
What was the end of the story about your grandmother?

874
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:21,400
About the story, about?

875
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:24,040
What was the end of the story about your grandmother?

876
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:27,760
The end of the story about your grandmother, you began...

877
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:31,120
Oh! That you want to hear again?

878
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:36,200
It’s a real grandmother story.

879
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:39,680
So don’t use too much intellectual things.

880
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:42,080
It’s a simple one.

881
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:48,040
See, she said that, those who believe in God,

882
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:54,640
just believe in His blessings, and they have full right on God.

883
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:03,600
She told a story, that once a man had to go and see God.

884
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:08,440
Now don’t ask question "How is it possible?’" But it’s a story.

885
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:18,920
And on his way he met a gentleman who was doing hatha yoga,

886
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:21,640
Western style.

887
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:25,600
Sometimes he was standing on his head,

888
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:28,040
and sometimes standing on one leg

889
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:31,920
and then tying up his hair to some branches of,

890
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:37,600
and dangling himself, and shouting ‘oh God, oh God, oh God’.

891
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:41,680
This fellow got frightened you know, the way he was showing.

892
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:46,240
His bones were swaying, all his bones, skeleton.

893
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:50,240
He said, ‘Now what are you doing?’

894
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:53,600
He said, “You see, I’m calling God, when will I see him...”

895
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:56,120
He said, “All right, I’m going to see God now,

896
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:59,680
I’ll tell Him, but for till then at least don’t

897
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:02,600
go to this extreme. It’s too much.

898
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:05,840
And you settle down. I’ll go and tell God

899
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:09,560
that He must come and see you, otherwise this is going on too much.”

900
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:12,920
Then he went ahead and he saw one gentleman,

901
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:16,480
just on the side of the road, was sitting there.

902
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:19,280
He said “What are you doing here?”

903
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:21,240
He said, “I’m doing nothing. God is doing everything,

904
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:23,280
what am I to do?”

905
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:28,600
So he said, “I’m going to see God. Have you any message?”

906
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:30,400
“No, no, you just tell Him, you see,

907
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:33,880
I have not eaten my food today, and He is not bothered.

908
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:36,520
Please tell Him to send all my food properly to me.

909
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:39,080
And tell Him that I need the food.”

910
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:41,400
So this fellow said, “Look at this arrogant fellow

911
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:43,320
who ordered God like this.

912
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:45,440
And he says God is doing everything

913
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:47,920
and he’s just relaxing and ordering God!”

914
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:50,080
So he went to God,

915
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:53,360
and whatever work he had, he finished with God, and all that,

916
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:55,640
and then he looked a little perplexed,

917
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:58,120
so God asked him “What’s the problem?”

918
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:02,120
He said “I have two more jobs to be done.

919
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:07,280
There is one fellow who met me on my way

920
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:11,160
and he was doing all these horrible things to his body

921
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:15,920
and he said that I hope I meet God with all this.”

922
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:19,960
“Oh ho, I know him, I know him very well” God said,

923
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:23,800
“All right, go and tell him that "You have to do some more of this,

924
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:27,600
it’s not sufficient.” He got a shock of his life.

925
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:29,960
He said “Look at this! God has no compassion at all.

926
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:32,000
How does He say?”

927
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,760
So the other fellow he told about, the one

928
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:38,680
who was just on the roadside.

929
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:44,760
So he said “Oh, he hasn’t got His food? How can it be?”

930
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:47,440
God called all his managers, everyone. He said,

931
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:50,760
“How is it you have not given him his food? Please,

932
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:53,760
arrange immediately!”

933
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:56,360
This fellow was surprised that, “What sort of a thing it is?”

934
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:58,480
And this fellow is just ordering God and

935
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:01,400
God is looking after this fellow!

936
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,720
So God, as He knows about everything, He told him

937
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:07,320
“All right. You are perplexed? All right, you go down,

938
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:10,160
and tell them one story. It’s a tall story,

939
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:13,200
but you tell them and see their reaction.”

940
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:16,880
So said the story was,

941
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:20,400
that “You go and tell them that I saw God

942
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:26,360
passing a camel through an eye of a needle.”

943
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:30,680
He said “All right, I will do that”,

944
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:34,080
"To both of them you tell and see their reactions

945
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:36,600
and then you will know why I did it”.

946
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:41,640
So he went to the first fellow and told him

947
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:45,280
that, "God has said, still you have to do more of these things.

948
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:48,440
He’ll come and meet you but

949
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:51,920
you have to do more. He said, “Yes, yes. Then He will meet?

950
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:54,120
So I will do more and more and more.”

951
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:57,040
Then he said, “Then what happened at God’s place?”

952
01:16:57,160 --> 01:16:59,800
He said “It’s something miraculous.”

953
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:05,280
“What was that?” He said, “The God passed a camel

954
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:08,680
through an eye of a needle!”

955
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:10,680
He said, “Must be a very big needle.”

956
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:13,400
He said, “No, just ordinary one.”

957
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:15,560
He said “How can that be?

958
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:18,800
Now you have been to God so you are telling me stories!

959
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:22,000
You can’t get along with me like this.

960
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:26,000
I understand this is all false,

961
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:28,960
just telling me stories.”

962
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:34,000
So this gentleman said, “All right, I’ll go to the other gentleman.”

963
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:36,560
So he went to him. He was having his food.

964
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:38,520
He said, “Sit down, sit down,

965
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:41,000
God has sent all food for me.

966
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:43,920
I know, once I tell Him. You see, there’s no need to tell Him also.

967
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:46,720
He really looks after me, but you wanted to have some message

968
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:49,200
so I said to Him. But how much He has sent food for me?

969
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:51,120
How can I eat all that?”

970
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:53,840
So this fellow was surprised, you see.

971
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:55,840
So he said, “What happened? You went to God.

972
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,960
What did you see there?” He said,

973
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:06,440
“I went and I saw a camel was passed through an eye of a needle,

974
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:08,880
a very small needle, I tell you.

975
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:13,560
And I saw it!” He said “So what? What’s so surprising?

976
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:16,400
After all He’s God.”

977
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:19,600
“What is there for Him, for a camel?

978
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:22,400
He can pass Universes after Universes.

979
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:24,680
He’s God Almighty!

980
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:28,760
What is so miraculous for Him?”

981
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:34,680
Then he realized.

982
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:36,680
This is what it is.

983
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:43,280
If you have faith, God wants to establish it.

984
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:47,560
Only your faith works it.

985
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:53,880
But the faith in Sahaja Yoga, as you know, has to be

986
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:57,600
the faith of Spirit, of the experience, is not blind faith.

987
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:01,200
When your eyes are open, you have to have faith in God.

988
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:06,000
But still after Realization “So what? Vibrations are there, so what?

989
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:09,000
What is it so great? Yes, so what?”

990
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:12,440
Then God says, “All right, go ahead!”

991
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:16,480
It’s such a tremendous thing that you get

992
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:18,360
but you don’t have faith in yourself,

993
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:20,960
how can you have faith in God?

994
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:25,280
You don’t respect yourself. How can you respect God?

995
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:29,680
And this is exactly what happens to human beings

996
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:32,600
when they deny Sahaja Yoga.

997
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:38,000
As you know there have been some miracles also in England,

998
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:42,120
which were stunning, and people were surprised.

999
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:45,360
But there’s absolutely nothing to be surprised at all,

1000
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:47,560
it’s absolutely very common.

1001
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:52,720
And I wish Gavin could tell you about these

1002
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:55,600
few miracles that he has seen, because

1003
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:59,640
some of you may not be knowing about it, so I would request him

1004
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:03,480
to tell all about this what happened and what happened in India.

1005
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:07,120
To Me it is not at miraculous, this is nothing.

1006
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:09,840
It’s very simple.

1007
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,920
And this has been published in the newspapers and all that.

1008
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:16,240
I think it’s better that Gavin should tell about this.

1009
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:24,040
Come here. Loudly.

1010
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:45,880
When I've [read] the newspapers it happened in Bedford,

1011
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:49,640
about [unclear].

1012
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:54,360
For the first time

1013
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:58,680
Shri Mataji had a programme in Bedford

1014
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:04,320
and, we learnt the next day, that,

1015
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:09,440
a young boy had been going home on his motorbike

1016
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:14,880
and he had an accident, he fell off the bike,

1017
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:18,720
and he said that a Lady stopped her car and got out

1018
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:21,280
and put Her hands on him where it was hurting,

1019
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:24,440
and he got better.

1020
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:27,680
So he went to the hospital because they asked him

1021
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:30,080
to do that and they said "You are all right"

1022
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:33,080
and they discharged him.

1023
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:39,240
And then he saw the picture of Mother in the newspaper,

1024
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:42,960
and he told his own mother. He said,

1025
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:45,760
“That’s the Lady who stopped the car.”

1026
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:51,200
So, newspaper reporter heard about this

1027
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:54,440
and he rang up the people who were organising the programme

1028
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:57,800
in Bedford. He said that,  “Is it true that

1029
01:21:58,040 --> 01:22:00,400
this Lady came to Bedford

1030
01:22:00,640 --> 01:22:05,640
stopped Her car to heal this boy?” And I said, “What time was it?”

1031
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:09,480
He said, “It was about 9:30 on that evening.”

1032
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:12,400
I said “It’s impossible, Mother was giving a programme

1033
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:14,560
in Bedford in the Guildhouse ”

1034
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:22,040
But he is still [convinced] it was Her.

1035
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:25,160
And we know that it was Her, in a way, also

1036
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:27,400
because we’ve heard other things.

1037
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:32,360
For instance in India, even more remarkable,

1038
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:33,920
Loudly.

1039
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:39,640
there’s a very highly placed attorney

1040
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:48,320
in Bombay, who is a very great devotee of our Mother.

1041
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:54,040
Many of us, we've met him. He’s come here, Mr. Pradhan.

1042
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:59,840
And, one day, when he was

1043
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:02,360
at a programme of Mother’s.

1044
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:05,480
No, no, at home, with other people, sitting and talking.

1045
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:08,360
No, at a meditation programme,

1046
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:14,040
just sitting, taking vibrations together.

1047
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:18,560
He realized that there was a case he was due to defend,

1048
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:21,080
which might come up in the courts.

1049
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:23,000
But it was a long way down the list

1050
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:24,920
and he thought “Well it will be all right,

1051
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:26,960
there are a lot of other cases, they will be heard,

1052
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:29,960
then mine will come up on Monday.”

1053
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:34,480
So the next day he went to the court just to check

1054
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:38,480
and they said, “What do you mean? You were here yesterday,

1055
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:41,560
it’s down in the court records. You defended the case brilliantly.

1056
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:44,720
The judge commented what an excellent defence you made,

1057
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:46,560
and you won the case.

1058
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:49,200
What are you talking about?”

1059
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:52,480
He said, “Oh, was I there?”

1060
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:58,320
and then  he thought “No, Mother, was there”

1061
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:05,640
Ani Petkar tsa diste ahai. (meaning: Tell about Petkar)

1062
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:08,080
Petkar was another one in Poona, there's a

1063
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:10,880
great Sahaja Yogi named Petkar.

1064
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:15,920
And he had a dream in the night that his brother,

1065
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:19,080
fell in a big well in the village where they live,

1066
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:21,920
which is north some way from Poona.

1067
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:26,200
He had a habit of walking in the night, the brother.

1068
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:33,280
So he was so anxious about this dream, he got up, he prayed

1069
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:36,520
before Mother’s picture that his brother should be all right.

1070
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:39,440
And the next morning he went home to his village

1071
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:42,120
and he met his father and his father said

1072
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:45,600
“Yes it’s true, he did fall in the well and

1073
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:48,480
they were looking for him with torches

1074
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:52,440
and suddenly your brother came up out of the water

1075
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:56,520
and was just sitting on the side of the bank. And

1076
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:01,160
his brother told him that, this is what happened,

1077
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:05,640
in the lights he saw a hand with the bangles,

1078
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:09,200
and they came and they pulled him up out of the water”

1079
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:11,280
And at first he couldn’t speak, he fainted,

1080
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:12,720
and then began to tell this

1081
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:15,480
to the people who had come looking for him.

1082
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:19,680
And the brother wasn’t  a devotee of Mataji,

1083
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:25,160
but Petkar had done something,

1084
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:29,360
and Mother was there.

1085
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:39,680
It’s like a camel being passed through the …

1086
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:45,960
All right. So any other questions please?

1087
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:49,040
Thank you very much Gavin.

1088
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:58,040
There are thousand and one stories which

1089
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:00,680
so many sahaja yogis can tell.

1090
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:03,840
How they were helped in every way.

1091
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:06,680
God looks after everyone,

1092
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:12,040
but specially the ones who are seeking

1093
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:17,680
and the highest of all, the ones who are realized souls.

1094
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:28,440
If there’s any question please ask Me.

1095
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:45,240
Did you hear him?

1096
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:48,200
What could be done about the threat of nuclear war?

1097
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:49,720
What is the?

1098
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:53,160
What could be done about the threat of nuclear war?

1099
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:58,680
What caould be done about the threat of nuclear war?

1100
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:04,200
If you believe in God just don’t think about it!

1101
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:11,880
Everything can be diffused isn’t it

1102
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:19,200
It’s only if God wants there will be wa, otherwise there cannot.

1103
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:25,400
But there should be people for whom God should interfere.

1104
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:30,960
If all of them are horrible devils, it’s better to have a war.

1105
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:45,480
Man proposes and God disposes – this is English proverb.

1106
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:50,000
You have forgotten all that.

1107
01:27:54,960 --> 01:28:00,760
Nuclear war is the creation of human beings.

1108
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:07,920
All right? And human beings are the creation of God.

1109
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:19,200
So the Creator,

1110
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:24,640
is not going to allow these stupid children

1111
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:27,480
to work it out.

1112
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:34,640
But in case they are that stupid, all of them put together,

1113
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:37,880
let them have it!

1114
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:45,880
What’s the use of also saving stupid people and donkeys?

1115
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:54,800
Only the people who are realized souls will be saved,

1116
01:28:56,440 --> 01:28:59,960
because nobody dies,

1117
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:08,200
they will be re-born again, those who are innocent.

1118
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:13,160
And those who are devils will go to hell.

1119
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:18,920
All right?

1120
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:22,240
We have one of them born here, see, Markandeya,

1121
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:24,760
he’s a born realized child.

1122
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:30,560
There are so many you can find them here.

1123
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:47,200
How does one dissolvefear?

1124
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:50,040
How does one dissolve fear?

1125
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:52,680
Fear?

1126
01:29:56,680 --> 01:29:58,680
Fear of what?

1127
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:04,520
Unconscious or conscious fear?

1128
01:30:06,520 --> 01:30:07,480
Fear of fear.

1129
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:08,760
Death?

1130
01:30:08,920 --> 01:30:10,920
Fear of fear.

1131
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:15,280
Fear of what?

1132
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:17,200
Of fear.

1133
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:19,840
To fear the fear, something.

1134
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:27,720
What fear it is? I tell you.

1135
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:29,600
Oh, fear without reason.

1136
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:32,560
You see the fear comes to you

1137
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:35,120
because not you are one with Reality.

1138
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:38,200
You are not one with Reality.

1139
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:42,040
All right? So in Sahaja Yoga there are many ways

1140
01:30:42,240 --> 01:30:44,880
by which you come in the centre.

1141
01:30:45,080 --> 01:30:47,480
You can have fear from your ego or from superego,

1142
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:49,040
from anywhere you can have.

1143
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:52,720
But if you are in the centre, fear drops out.

1144
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:56,120
Gradually the fear drops out completely.

1145
01:30:56,960 --> 01:31:01,120
All right? It’s the happening of awakening

1146
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:04,960
that takes you away from that fear.

1147
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:08,800
It’s a happening. You don’t have to do anything.

1148
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:11,280
What has to happen is that,

1149
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:14,840
when you ascend, it will all drop out automatically.

1150
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:19,760
We have so many ways and methods of

1151
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:22,480
keeping yourself in the centre

1152
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:25,040
and of ascending, that’s all.

1153
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:28,360
Not only fear but so many things drop out,

1154
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:33,200
habits, addictions,

1155
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:38,400
tempers, lots of things.

1156
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:42,360
All these barriers drop out because you get out of it.

1157
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:46,080
You are born again. All right?

1158
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:51,760
That's how. So you are not to do anything about it. Just ascend.

1159
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:56,400
And there are so many ways and methods. I hope you will come to

1160
01:31:56,800 --> 01:32:00,640
our programmes and to our ashram here.

1161
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:02,720
And they will tell you how to do it.

1162
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:07,080
There are many, we had people, who had horrible fears,

1163
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:11,640
but they are all right. Now they are fearless.

1164
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,440
But they are not fearful.

1165
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:19,920
Mother, if only You can advise us regarding food.

1166
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:22,280
Regarding what?

1167
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:25,200
Whatever food should be taken.

1168
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:29,480
In Sahaja Yoga we do not pay much attention to food.

1169
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:32,680
Only thing I feel that,

1170
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:36,760
so much attention has been paid to food.

1171
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:39,760
It's not a correct attitude.

1172
01:32:40,040 --> 01:32:43,120
You see, the Spirit doesn’t eat at all,

1173
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:49,200
it’s a detached thing. Atma is beyond.

1174
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:55,480
Now when we try to say that, if we eat this kind of food,

1175
01:32:55,680 --> 01:33:01,360
Atma will be happy, that kind of,  Atma will be happy, is not true.

1176
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:06,160
For example we’ll say vegetarianism,

1177
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:09,880
which is a very common problem with people is.

1178
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:14,120
You’ll be amazed, all the false gurus are vegetarians;

1179
01:33:14,360 --> 01:33:17,840
one by one, Mahesh yogi, Rajneesh...

1180
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:23,240
Rajneesh is a great vedge. He doesn’t even eat garlic and onions.

1181
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:25,720
This Mahesh yogi’s disciples,

1182
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:29,040
if you show them a garlic, they’ll jump, 100 times.

1183
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:34,320
They are afraid of the garlic! Can you imagine?

1184
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:41,240
But I don’t say that you eat meat, that’s not the point is.

1185
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:46,280
But those people, whatever they require they should eat,

1186
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:52,760
but don’t eat meats of animals which are bigger than you.

1187
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:55,880
Now what happens?

1188
01:33:56,720 --> 01:33:59,360
How the evolution in the animals takes place?

1189
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:02,120
Nobody has put attention to that.

1190
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:05,400
Supposing there are many chickens you save.

1191
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:08,520
I am not going to give Realization to chickens, am I?

1192
01:34:08,840 --> 01:34:12,920
Or to bugs, am I going to give Realization? Or to mosquitoes?

1193
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:18,520
So our attention is on these, not on the higher level of life.

1194
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:22,080
When we think of food, that we must save chickens

1195
01:34:22,520 --> 01:34:26,480
actually nothing dies. Is Krishna Himself has said ‘Nothing dies’.

1196
01:34:26,720 --> 01:34:28,480
All right?

1197
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:31,720
And that’s how some people denied Krishna,

1198
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:35,200
because He had a samhara shakti, He used to kill.

1199
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:39,160
And killing is so important in evolution.

1200
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:41,160
Otherwise if you don’t kill these rakshasas,

1201
01:34:41,320 --> 01:34:43,920
are you going to adore them?

1202
01:34:44,120 --> 01:34:45,320
What are you to do with them?

1203
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:47,960
They are to be killed they are to be thrown out.

1204
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:51,920
In the evolutionary process also,

1205
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:56,840
so many things have to die out for the real thing to come up.

1206
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:01,240
Say this flower has to die to become the fruit, all right?

1207
01:35:01,680 --> 01:35:04,440
And there is no ‘hinsa’ in it.

1208
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,520
The word ‘hinsa’ is so misinterpreted

1209
01:35:07,720 --> 01:35:12,520
that people are satisfied, if they do not eat meat. It's not true.

1210
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:17,120
For some people it is essential they must eat meat.

1211
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:22,080
Now as you know, Sahaja Yoga works on the power of shakti.

1212
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:27,600
And the Devi not only killed raskshasas but She ate them!

1213
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:29,920
And She drank the blood

1214
01:35:30,040 --> 01:35:33,200
of these rakshasas as you know, Raktabija’s.

1215
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,360
So how can She be vegetarian?

1216
01:35:38,440 --> 01:35:41,280
Just tell Me. Put reason.

1217
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:42,920
All right?

1218
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:46,040
Because we are conditioned that way, we think.

1219
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:51,480
But actually what happens, in the evolutionary process,

1220
01:35:52,120 --> 01:35:55,760
when a person, say, eats chicken,

1221
01:35:57,240 --> 01:36:00,440
not person, we should say, a higher animal,

1222
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:05,400
eats a lower animal, then it passes through the circle

1223
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:07,680
and achieves a higher life.

1224
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:11,840
It's absolutely this is how evolution takes place.

1225
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:16,280
Of course, we can give Realization

1226
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:18,560
to human beings so we need not worry about that.

1227
01:36:18,760 --> 01:36:20,760
That’s a different point. But,

1228
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:25,680
if you eat chicken, you definitely give it a higher life.

1229
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:28,080
But not the animals which are bigger than you.

1230
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:31,920
Smaller animals, if you eat, it’s

1231
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:35,280
not going to be harmed by that. No doubt.

1232
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:37,120
But you may be harmed.

1233
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:40,680
For example, if you eat mosquitoes, you’ll be harmed!

1234
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:47,640
Now in countries where there is not even any vegetable or anything,

1235
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:50,000
they have not seen green leaves, like Greenland.

1236
01:36:50,200 --> 01:36:54,680
Now the name is ‘Greenland’, they have never seen green colour!

1237
01:36:56,200 --> 01:37:03,080
Are they sinners that they can’t live without eating meat?

1238
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:08,000
How can God be so partial?

1239
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:12,320
There are many countries where they cannot live without eating meat.

1240
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:16,800
So, there must be some reason. All right? So reason it out.

1241
01:37:17,400 --> 01:37:21,400
If you eat vegetables, all right.

1242
01:37:22,040 --> 01:37:24,040
If you want to eat meat, it’s all right.

1243
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:29,240
But again for a Sahaja Yogi, what we decide is not

1244
01:37:29,640 --> 01:37:32,720
on what you like, but what is good for you.

1245
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:36,960
For example, for Western people it is better that they don’t eat

1246
01:37:37,200 --> 01:37:39,280
much meat now because, I think

1247
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:42,440
they and their fathers have eaten all that.

1248
01:37:42,920 --> 01:37:46,600
Eat less. There should have more carbohydrates, while

1249
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:48,800
the vegetarians should take more proteins.

1250
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,680
If they do not like meat they should take to other proteins,

1251
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:54,240
because proteins are very important.

1252
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:57,640
If you do not take proteins in life, people suffer.

1253
01:37:57,920 --> 01:38:02,600
In Sahaja Yoga we find such people have trouble from Left Nabhi.

1254
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:06,000
I have seen in India, many people, who are strict vegetarians,

1255
01:38:06,160 --> 01:38:08,160
have a problem of Left Nabhi.

1256
01:38:08,440 --> 01:38:10,800
So we told them, all right, you can eat proteins.

1257
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:12,640
There are so many proteins you can eat.

1258
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:15,440
If you don’t like to eat meat from childhood, you have not eaten,

1259
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:18,280
you don’t feel like eating, all right, forget it. Eat some.

1260
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:21,600
We have to be wise, we have to be open,

1261
01:38:22,120 --> 01:38:27,120
we are not to be bound by our conditioning from childhood.

1262
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:29,440
This we must understand,

1263
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:32,760
that vegetarianism is not going to take you to God,

1264
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:35,640
neither non-vegetarianism.

1265
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:40,520
Because the Spirit is neither a vegetarian nor a non-vegetarian.

1266
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:43,760
It is a detached thing, it’s above food.

1267
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:47,920
But whatever you need for your body is important.

1268
01:38:48,360 --> 01:38:50,400
If you need protein, eat protein.

1269
01:38:50,680 --> 01:38:53,520
If you don’t eat protein, don’t eat protein,

1270
01:38:53,800 --> 01:38:56,880
but then eat something which you need.

1271
01:38:57,840 --> 01:39:02,480
So it is not that one has to understand it

1272
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:08,880
in a way that we understand as a chicken and vegetables,

1273
01:39:09,080 --> 01:39:10,960
but we must understand

1274
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:15,360
in the way a doctor understands, proteins and carbohydrates.

1275
01:39:15,680 --> 01:39:19,120
All right? Whatever you like, you can eat.

1276
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:23,920
There’s no, in Sahaja Yoga there’s no such a compulsion.

1277
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:27,640
So many saints used to eat meat.

1278
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:32,240
So many saints. Guru Nanaka, Kabira, Mohammed-sahib,

1279
01:39:32,720 --> 01:39:36,320
Christ, Rama Himself, Krishna Himself.

1280
01:39:36,520 --> 01:39:40,440
All of them ate meat. Even Buddha ate meat.

1281
01:39:41,240 --> 01:39:44,560
The proof is that, at the end of His life,

1282
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:49,160
He went to one of His disciples who was a hunter,

1283
01:39:50,360 --> 01:39:53,640
and He told him, “I am very hungry, give Me something to eat.”

1284
01:39:53,880 --> 01:39:56,040
So he said “Sir, I have nothing else but a wild boar

1285
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:58,800
which I have killed very recently

1286
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,200
and it is not yet fully cooked.”

1287
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:03,720
So he said, “All right, doesn’t matter I’ll have it,”

1288
01:40:04,040 --> 01:40:07,440
And He ate it and He died because of that

1289
01:40:07,880 --> 01:40:11,600
half-cooked wild boar.

1290
01:40:13,240 --> 01:40:15,040
And He died with that.

1291
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:18,600
So now Buddhists think that, “We should not eat meat.” It’s not so.

1292
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:21,960
Because He ate something that was half-cooked,

1293
01:40:22,280 --> 01:40:23,960
That means He did eat, isn’t it?

1294
01:40:24,160 --> 01:40:28,400
Even Jains know that, it’s only Neminath

1295
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:32,840
who got a kind of a feeling against meat eating.

1296
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:35,320
That was Neminath, was at the time of,

1297
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:37,880
he was contemporary of Shri Krishna.

1298
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:41,560
When his marriage was celebrated he found many birds

1299
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:44,080
were killed and he felt terrible about it

1300
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:47,600
and he didn’t want to eat any meat. Was all right.

1301
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:50,120
It’s all right. If you don’t feel like, don’t eat it.

1302
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:52,760
But then a cult started.

1303
01:40:53,080 --> 01:40:57,000
But that means till Neminath, means, Jainis are ancient people,

1304
01:40:57,680 --> 01:41:01,320
till Neminath they were eating meat – is a fact.

1305
01:41:03,400 --> 01:41:06,480
So to get attached to some idea

1306
01:41:06,680 --> 01:41:10,200
is not the way you are doing it.

1307
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:12,880
If you don’t want to eat, just don’t eat it.

1308
01:41:13,120 --> 01:41:17,400
And if somebody has to eat it, because of health purposes

1309
01:41:17,880 --> 01:41:21,120
or because of the need, there’s nothing wrong in it.

1310
01:41:22,120 --> 01:41:24,040
Everybody has a different need,

1311
01:41:24,240 --> 01:41:26,960
every individual has a different need

1312
01:41:28,040 --> 01:41:31,160
If I, personally, take just to vegetarian food,

1313
01:41:31,320 --> 01:41:33,440
I won’t exist I can tell you.

1314
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:40,280
Because I have such a great capacity to have purges.

1315
01:41:41,080 --> 01:41:43,080
If I meet somebody, shake hands with somebody,

1316
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:45,240
he has lots of bhoots you see,

1317
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:49,360
then I just clear him out by purging.

1318
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:54,960
And if I take just to say, carbohydrates,

1319
01:41:55,080 --> 01:41:56,960
I don’t know what will happen to Me.

1320
01:41:57,160 --> 01:42:00,560
But doesn’t mean that I should be a meat eater,

1321
01:42:00,760 --> 01:42:03,560
but I have to have proteins. That’s the point is.

1322
01:42:03,960 --> 01:42:06,800
It’s no question of meat or anything but this is question

1323
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:10,320
of eating proteins or carbohydrates.

1324
01:42:11,480 --> 01:42:13,280
We have to be wise about it.

1325
01:42:13,480 --> 01:42:15,360
And all such cults you see,

1326
01:42:15,560 --> 01:42:18,960
that “You eat this, you eat that”, is not so.

1327
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:21,000
There is no cult in Sahaja Yoga.

1328
01:42:21,160 --> 01:42:24,600
Every individual has  a different personality,

1329
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:29,120
but, the common thing is one, and that is the Spirit.

1330
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:35,440
But for example, drinking, we abhor.

1331
01:42:35,640 --> 01:42:38,560
But after Realization, before that I don’t talk of drinking.

1332
01:42:38,920 --> 01:42:42,320
Because it goes against your chaitanya, means your awareness.

1333
01:42:42,680 --> 01:42:45,600
So one has to look after the awareness.

1334
01:42:46,200 --> 01:42:49,360
So much time has been wasted in people in

1335
01:42:49,560 --> 01:42:51,040
deciding what to eat what not to eat.

1336
01:42:51,240 --> 01:42:53,040
What have they achieved? Nothing!

1337
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:57,360
Sometimes I have seen vegetarians can be horrid people.

1338
01:42:58,280 --> 01:43:03,600
Absolutely horrid. We have a community in India called Marwadis.

1339
01:43:04,680 --> 01:43:08,400
They are blood suckers you see, and they are vegetarians.

1340
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:13,960
Not all, we have some in Sahaja Yoga also, very few.

1341
01:43:14,760 --> 01:43:19,360
They are extremely money-minded people, you know that.

1342
01:43:20,920 --> 01:43:23,760
So, this kind of thing, to believe that

1343
01:43:23,960 --> 01:43:27,080
such food will make us great is, will be falsehood.

1344
01:43:27,280 --> 01:43:28,920
So you don’t decide on that.

1345
01:43:29,040 --> 01:43:31,880
You decide on proteins and carbohydrates.

1346
01:43:32,480 --> 01:43:36,200
Whatever good for your health, you should do.

1347
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:40,360
Those who eat too much of vegetarian food

1348
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:43,280
are liable to certain type of diseases

1349
01:43:43,440 --> 01:43:47,280
and those who eat too much of non-veg are liable to some.

1350
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:53,880
Those who eat vegetarian food can get leucoderma very easily,

1351
01:43:54,880 --> 01:44:00,520
can get leukemia very easily.

1352
01:44:01,320 --> 01:44:04,920
Certain types of cancers they can get very easily.

1353
01:44:05,200 --> 01:44:08,400
Those who are non-vegetarians can get another kind of diseases.

1354
01:44:08,600 --> 01:44:11,040
There are numerous diseases they can get.

1355
01:44:11,400 --> 01:44:14,040
So we have to have a balance,

1356
01:44:14,240 --> 01:44:17,520
that when we eat vegetarian food also, we must see that we eat

1357
01:44:17,720 --> 01:44:21,880
sufficiently, sufficient amount of proteins,

1358
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,600
because body has to be all right.

1359
01:44:26,040 --> 01:44:30,480
Healthy body is the temple of God,

1360
01:44:30,680 --> 01:44:35,120
and to temple of God, you have to keep it healthy and happy.

1361
01:44:36,040 --> 01:44:39,200
That’s the attitude. But it’s not so important,

1362
01:44:39,560 --> 01:44:41,800
because once you get into Sahaja Yoga, as it is,

1363
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:45,440
automatically doctors' bill drops to nil.

1364
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:46,960
Automatically.

1365
01:44:47,440 --> 01:44:50,760
So we have to take a wise attitude towards ourselves.

1366
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:54,480
Not to torture ourselves because of certain conditionings.

1367
01:44:55,120 --> 01:44:57,160
Because we have been taught something from childhood

1368
01:44:57,280 --> 01:45:00,200
we should not accept it, but see for ourselves.

1369
01:45:00,760 --> 01:45:03,480
I have seen that people who had

1370
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,880
tremendous stigmas about vegetarian food,

1371
01:45:07,080 --> 01:45:10,600
when they took to, say, protein food,

1372
01:45:11,040 --> 01:45:14,000
they improved very much in vibrations. They did.

1373
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:17,200
Protein food is very important for certain people

1374
01:45:17,560 --> 01:45:19,600
and for certain people carbohydrates.

1375
01:45:19,800 --> 01:45:23,360
Liverish people should take to carbohydrates.

1376
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:29,040
It is absolutely an open thing for us to understand.

1377
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:33,600
But whatever goes against our awareness,

1378
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:38,200
because in our own awareness we have to achieve our Spirit,

1379
01:45:39,640 --> 01:45:41,720
we drop out that, also, very easily.

1380
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:44,160
I don’t have to say that, “Don’t drink! Don’t smoke!”

1381
01:45:44,360 --> 01:45:46,360
You just drop out.

1382
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:55,720
Mother, Bernard Shaw, a very distinguished Irish writer

1383
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:58,920
apparently once said that he doesn’t like his stomach

1384
01:45:59,120 --> 01:46:01,800
to be graveyard out of dead animals.

1385
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:05,200
Now Bernard Shaw did not give Realization to anyone, did he?

1386
01:46:05,360 --> 01:46:07,640
He was very great and a vegetarian.

1387
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:09,560
You see, he might become vegetarian

1388
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:12,360
doesn’t mean that everybody should, is it?

1389
01:46:13,080 --> 01:46:16,960
It’s not a graveyard. I tell you, it’s not a graveyard.

1390
01:46:17,160 --> 01:46:19,920
He must be constipated.

1391
01:46:22,280 --> 01:46:25,880
That’s all I can say. You see Bernard Shaw,

1392
01:46:26,080 --> 01:46:28,880
is all right whatever he said. According to his own is correct.

1393
01:46:29,080 --> 01:46:31,320
For him it may be.

1394
01:46:32,120 --> 01:46:34,560
You see most of the vegetarians

1395
01:46:34,760 --> 01:46:36,840
have a problem and non-vegetarians have a problem.

1396
01:46:37,040 --> 01:46:39,280
I have seen it every day in My life.

1397
01:46:39,640 --> 01:46:41,520
Today is not Bernard Shaw here, otherwise

1398
01:46:41,640 --> 01:46:44,000
I would have told him what he suffered from.

1399
01:46:44,200 --> 01:46:48,880
You see it is, whatever they express in their individual experience.

1400
01:46:49,280 --> 01:46:53,000
All right? I am not expressing an individual experience,

1401
01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:57,840
I am giving you an experience of many. All right?

1402
01:46:58,040 --> 01:47:00,720
I get your point that one should eat proteins.

1403
01:47:00,920 --> 01:47:03,640
Are you saying that vegetarian food doesn’t have proteins?

1404
01:47:03,800 --> 01:47:08,880
What is it? Yes, you can. So you should eat. When did I say no?

1405
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:13,320
I never said, that if you can eat, eat proteins, finished.

1406
01:47:13,560 --> 01:47:16,680
It should be decided on proteins and carbohydrates,

1407
01:47:16,840 --> 01:47:20,360
and not on all these things because nobody dies.

1408
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:27,640
You see, we have no compassion for our own fellow being.

1409
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:34,560
Where are we? We have no compassion for our own relations,

1410
01:47:34,760 --> 01:47:36,680
our own father, our own mother,

1411
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:41,080
our own brothers and sisters and other people.

1412
01:47:41,960 --> 01:47:45,280
And what’s the use of having compassion on things

1413
01:47:45,480 --> 01:47:48,080
which do not understand at all?

1414
01:47:48,360 --> 01:47:53,160
And they don’t need it! Who needs compassion, are human beings,

1415
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:55,720
who are aware of it.

1416
01:47:57,600 --> 01:48:00,880
It is too far fetched, and that is very true with human mind,

1417
01:48:01,080 --> 01:48:03,520
because they want to shift their mind to something

1418
01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:05,760
which will take them away from Reality.

1419
01:48:05,960 --> 01:48:08,720
Like the other day I told somebody not to feel guilty

1420
01:48:08,920 --> 01:48:11,120
because they were catching on the Left Vishuddhi.

1421
01:48:11,400 --> 01:48:14,160
And she said, “I feel guilty”. I said, “For what?”

1422
01:48:14,360 --> 01:48:16,800
“I feel guilty for Vietnam”. I said “For what?”

1423
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:18,960
“Because the people are dying in Vietnam,”

1424
01:48:19,160 --> 01:48:22,080
I said, “Are you going to solve the problem of Vietnam?

1425
01:48:22,480 --> 01:48:26,680
Are you concerned with it? Why are you worried about that?”

1426
01:48:27,640 --> 01:48:32,080
You do whatever is good for you,

1427
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:37,000
and what you can do. This is how we shift our mind.

1428
01:48:37,200 --> 01:48:41,320
And it’s very true, you see. People have their accepted ideas,

1429
01:48:41,560 --> 01:48:45,400
they stick onto it, and get nothing.

1430
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:51,480
So I say that there should be no ‘ism’ about anything.

1431
01:48:51,680 --> 01:48:54,320
You must have an open mind.

1432
01:48:55,400 --> 01:48:59,280
Absolutely an open mind.

1433
01:49:01,080 --> 01:49:04,600
Anybody who, whatever problems they have,

1434
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:08,200
they know, and they should solve it.

1435
01:49:11,080 --> 01:49:15,280
I am not here to spread vegetarianism or non-vegetarianism,

1436
01:49:15,880 --> 01:49:18,360
I am here to spread Sahaja Yoga.

1437
01:49:18,520 --> 01:49:22,200
"Sahaja Samadhi Lago”. That’s what is said.

1438
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:25,200
You have to get your samadhi.

1439
01:49:25,720 --> 01:49:29,720
And that how do you get? Sahaj, spontaneous.

1440
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:34,760
It depends, it depends what we eat, you see.

1441
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:39,960
How will we get samadi if we do not have proper food or anything?

1442
01:49:40,240 --> 01:49:43,160
Now, I will say that, I’ve already told you about Buddha.

1443
01:49:43,360 --> 01:49:47,520
What do you think of Guru Nanak?
What do you think of Christ?

1444
01:49:47,720 --> 01:49:50,560
You think, were they any way lower?

1445
01:49:50,760 --> 01:49:54,600
You see because the Spirit is not concerned. As Krishna has said,

1446
01:49:54,760 --> 01:49:58,200
"Nainam chindanti shastrani nainam dahati pavakah

1447
01:49:58,360 --> 01:50:02,160
na chainam kledayanty apo na sosayati marutah". (meaning: The Spirit cannot be cut or burned, nor moistened nor blown)

1448
01:50:02,360 --> 01:50:06,200
It is Shri Krishna himself has said it.

1449
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:09,480
And He Himself has killed rakshasas and Jainis are against

1450
01:50:09,680 --> 01:50:12,040
Shri Krishna because He killed rakshashas.

1451
01:50:12,360 --> 01:50:15,280
According to him He’s a hinsatmak (aggressive) fellow.

1452
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:18,320
If you go too far with it, then you go to that limit,

1453
01:50:18,520 --> 01:50:22,480
where you start saving bugs and mosquitoes.

1454
01:50:23,200 --> 01:50:26,880
But we have got it, we have got Realization, no doubt about it.

1455
01:50:27,560 --> 01:50:31,200
First of all you get your Realization. You have had all these ideas,

1456
01:50:31,520 --> 01:50:34,440
all our forefathers had these ideas, they never got Realization.

1457
01:50:34,680 --> 01:50:38,080
All right? So forget it. First thing is get to your Spirit.

1458
01:50:38,280 --> 01:50:41,560
This is not important, this is just you are directing your attention

1459
01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:44,280
to something else which is not important.

1460
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:50,960
So many of them. So we discard Mohammed-sahib, we discard everyone.

1461
01:50:51,960 --> 01:50:55,440
That’s how it is, it’s Brahmanism,

1462
01:50:57,280 --> 01:51:00,560
it's Brahmanism. It’s ‘ism’ again.

1463
01:51:00,920 --> 01:51:04,480
We discard all the great people of the world by this.

1464
01:51:05,680 --> 01:51:08,320
They were not realized? Kahlil Gibran was he not realized?

1465
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:10,920
How will you know?

1466
01:51:11,160 --> 01:51:12,720
Unless and until you are realized

1467
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:14,840
you will not know who is realized or not.

1468
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:18,280
You will live on these ideas only.

1469
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:22,560
You have to feel it. William Blake, was he not realized?

1470
01:51:23,560 --> 01:51:26,240
He was Markandeya Himself.

1471
01:51:28,480 --> 01:51:32,640
We have forgotten so many things. Even in the Indian Scriptures

1472
01:51:32,840 --> 01:51:35,760
we never see, we don’t want to see these things.

1473
01:51:36,840 --> 01:51:40,680
We had a great saint in India, called Sajan Kasai.

1474
01:51:46,720 --> 01:51:50,800
So one should understand, that in Sahaja Yoga,

1475
01:51:51,200 --> 01:51:56,480
whatever is the Reality, we try to accept. See for yourself.

1476
01:51:57,040 --> 01:52:00,200
What about your vibrations? Are you getting vibrations or not?

1477
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:03,280
That’s the main point is. Attention should be there.

1478
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:06,160
Actually vegetarians have much more attention on food

1479
01:52:06,280 --> 01:52:08,640
than the non-veg have. I can tell you this fact.

1480
01:52:08,840 --> 01:52:11,720
And the women of vegetarian people

1481
01:52:11,920 --> 01:52:15,840
are all the time busy, what to make for their men.

1482
01:52:16,520 --> 01:52:19,560
All the time they are planning what to have

1483
01:52:19,760 --> 01:52:21,680
“Aaj papad banaye ki falana banaye ki…?”

1484
01:52:21,880 --> 01:52:24,440
They are all the time busy cooking, cooking, cooking.

1485
01:52:25,040 --> 01:52:28,480
And the men are also all the time fussing about food.

1486
01:52:28,840 --> 01:52:30,840
“In that house I ate that karela.

1487
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:34,000
In that house I ate this, you better make that.”

1488
01:52:34,520 --> 01:52:36,760
All our Indian men I know too well.

1489
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:40,080
And I know all the vegetarians. I am from that country.

1490
01:52:40,520 --> 01:52:43,040
And the women are busy with that and men are busy with that.

1491
01:52:43,240 --> 01:52:46,760
All their attention is in food all the time.

1492
01:52:48,040 --> 01:52:51,480
Women want to cook and men want to enjoy.

1493
01:52:52,120 --> 01:52:53,120
That’s not the way.

1494
01:52:53,560 --> 01:52:55,720
Remove your attention from food, it’s not important.

1495
01:52:55,920 --> 01:52:58,680
Whatever you are eating is all right. Have a balanced diet.

1496
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:00,880
Don’t worry about others.

1497
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:03,200
You are not forced to eat anything in Sahaja Yoga.

1498
01:53:03,400 --> 01:53:06,200
Nothing is forced, but you eat what you like.

1499
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:12,360
But the thing that you like must be balanced,

1500
01:53:14,080 --> 01:53:18,040
must be proper, must be health giving.

1501
01:53:18,640 --> 01:53:21,560
That is the point is. Whatever you eat, you eat.

1502
01:53:22,160 --> 01:53:26,120
Nothing is forced. You have to see for yourself.

1503
01:53:26,520 --> 01:53:29,960
So many of Sahaja yogis just don’t eat meat at all.

1504
01:53:30,160 --> 01:53:32,480
I mean they just don’t eat, and they need not eat at all,

1505
01:53:32,640 --> 01:53:34,240
there’s no need.

1506
01:53:34,400 --> 01:53:37,560
I mean if you don’t want to eat, just don’t eat it!

1507
01:53:37,800 --> 01:53:42,200
It’s not importan. [missing part] All your quality is tested,

1508
01:53:42,440 --> 01:53:45,840
when your Kundalini is awakened.

1509
01:53:46,080 --> 01:53:49,080
Before that you do not know.

1510
01:53:49,400 --> 01:53:52,280
I've known of people, they think, oh, they are very great.

1511
01:53:52,680 --> 01:53:54,880
Like one sanyasi fellow came in,

1512
01:53:55,080 --> 01:53:57,760
and he was sitting on the dais (stage)

1513
01:53:58,400 --> 01:54:00,840
and he thinks, oh, he is a great man,

1514
01:54:01,080 --> 01:54:04,080
he’s the very big man and all that.

1515
01:54:05,040 --> 01:54:08,000
And my grandchild who’s a realized soul, she was sitting in front,

1516
01:54:08,200 --> 01:54:10,720
and I was the guest of honour there, so I was sitting there.

1517
01:54:10,920 --> 01:54:12,760
So she shouted from her seat,

1518
01:54:12,960 --> 01:54:15,280
She said, “Mother, ask this man with the maxi to get out

1519
01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:17,360
he’s giving too much heat to us!”

1520
01:54:17,520 --> 01:54:20,480
And this fellow was going to talk on vegetarianism,

1521
01:54:20,680 --> 01:54:22,760
this that "ism", another "ism" and religion

1522
01:54:22,960 --> 01:54:24,960
and God and this and that.

1523
01:54:25,240 --> 01:54:26,960
And she said, “Please ask him to get out!

1524
01:54:27,160 --> 01:54:28,960
He’s giving heat to us this maxi-fellow.”

1525
01:54:29,160 --> 01:54:30,880
She has thought he's a maxi-man.

1526
01:54:31,200 --> 01:54:35,200
She didn’t know he was, he was supposed to be detached.

1527
01:54:37,040 --> 01:54:40,080
Those so-called ‘sanyasis’, be careful.

1528
01:54:41,080 --> 01:54:44,360
So-called ‘vegetarians’, they are such hot-tempered people.

1529
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:46,840
Aren’t you hot-tempered!

1530
01:54:51,960 --> 01:54:54,400
So what you manifest is the point,

1531
01:54:54,600 --> 01:54:59,320
and manifestation is silent. It works.

1532
01:55:03,480 --> 01:55:05,960
So, “Somebody said so”, “Another fellow said so”,

1533
01:55:06,160 --> 01:55:10,600
So what? What about you? What have you to say?

1534
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:15,920
What have you manifested?

1535
01:55:16,200 --> 01:55:19,240
Have you got the powers of your Spirit?

1536
01:55:19,720 --> 01:55:23,720
Ask a question to yourself. That’s the first thing you achieve.

1537
01:55:25,520 --> 01:55:27,040
Then we’ll talk about these things.

1538
01:55:27,200 --> 01:55:29,640
First of all you achieve your Spirit.

1539
01:55:41,760 --> 01:55:45,320
This is the first time people are achieving their Spirit, isn’t it?

1540
01:55:45,520 --> 01:55:48,160
This is the first time it’s happening.

1541
01:55:48,360 --> 01:55:50,160
So you cannot have

1542
01:55:50,360 --> 01:55:54,440
any relationship with anything else, you can say.

1543
01:55:56,440 --> 01:55:58,440
This is an absolute thing that should happen

1544
01:55:58,600 --> 01:56:00,160
and that you should ask for.

1545
01:56:00,320 --> 01:56:02,480
Because somebody said so, because this was so.

1546
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:04,440
What? What have they done?

1547
01:56:04,840 --> 01:56:08,160
Did they manifest their Spirit?

1548
01:56:08,920 --> 01:56:12,760
All right, they did, one or two, here and there.

1549
01:56:13,760 --> 01:56:16,800
So first, get your Spirit manifested.

1550
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,800
Don’t get lost into these things. Be kind to yourself.

1551
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,680
First be ‘vegetarian’ to yourself,

1552
01:56:23,120 --> 01:56:25,760
by being kind and by getting your Spirit

1553
01:56:25,880 --> 01:56:29,280
liberated completely from all these ideas.

1554
01:56:30,160 --> 01:56:32,320
Spirit is a reality, it’s not an idea,

1555
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:36,080
and it cannot be nourished by any idea,

1556
01:56:36,280 --> 01:56:40,320
except Reality, which you face yourself and manifest.

1557
01:56:40,680 --> 01:56:43,520
Mother, what should we do get the Spirit?

1558
01:56:43,720 --> 01:56:46,480
What should we do get the Spirit? What should we do?

1559
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:49,000
That’s what I said, you don’t have to do anything.

1560
01:56:49,160 --> 01:56:51,600
That’s what you should do.

1561
01:56:52,840 --> 01:56:55,920
The Kundalini has to rise, all right?

1562
01:56:56,280 --> 01:56:59,040
Now what does this lamp do, when it is to be enlightened?

1563
01:56:59,240 --> 01:57:02,240
The another enlightened light comes near it and manifests this.

1564
01:57:02,440 --> 01:57:05,120
You are all ready for it. All right?

1565
01:57:05,360 --> 01:57:08,480
Only thing , the Kundalini has to be awakened and it works out.

1566
01:57:08,680 --> 01:57:11,680
Anybody who is enlightened can give you Realization.

1567
01:57:12,280 --> 01:57:15,760
You want us to work it out on you? We’ll try.

1568
01:57:16,720 --> 01:57:19,360
All of you who haven’t go Realization so far,

1569
01:57:19,560 --> 01:57:22,040
we can try that. Not today,

1570
01:57:23,120 --> 01:57:27,920
I’m sorry but, because the time is up, I think.

1571
01:57:29,040 --> 01:57:31,760
You have to go to our ashrams

1572
01:57:31,960 --> 01:57:34,680
where people are doing this work and

1573
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:38,280
you all are going to feel the Realization.

1574
01:57:39,280 --> 01:57:45,120
I used to do that before. In every programme we did it.

1575
01:57:45,360 --> 01:57:49,280
All of them got their Realization, in the programmes only.

1576
01:57:50,400 --> 01:57:53,320
And if the Kundalini is not coming up,

1577
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:55,880
they will tell you what’s the problem is.

1578
01:57:56,120 --> 01:57:58,000
All right? Try to do that.

1579
01:57:58,160 --> 01:58:00,760
Help yourself. You have to co-operate with yourself.

1580
01:58:01,160 --> 01:58:03,600
You are not to get identified with

1581
01:58:03,760 --> 01:58:06,920
some wrong ideas or right ideas or whatever you think.

1582
01:58:07,240 --> 01:58:11,520
It is the Kundalini which is not moving. That’s the main point is.

1583
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:16,360
Every Indian knows that the Kundalini has to be awakened

1584
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:20,480
to get to Atma Sakshatkar, to get to Self-Realization.

1585
01:58:20,680 --> 01:58:23,480
And if the Kundalini is not moving then there’s a problem.

1586
01:58:23,680 --> 01:58:27,680
And what is that problem? That these people know.

1587
01:58:28,280 --> 01:58:31,240
All right? So just co-operate with yourself.

1588
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:34,280
Be humble about it, it has to work out.

1589
01:58:36,240 --> 01:58:38,320
Thik hai na? (Ok?)

1590
01:58:38,880 --> 01:58:40,760
Zarur (absolutely).

1591
01:58:41,440 --> 01:58:43,320
Aasha ruk lijiye, aisa hath rukhiye. (keep hope, hands like this)

1592
01:58:43,520 --> 01:58:45,400
Just see, you will work it. It will work out as

1593
01:58:45,520 --> 01:58:48,800
It flows as Chaitanya Lahari in the hands.

1594
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:55,920
I mean, I would say people like

1595
01:58:57,680 --> 01:59:00,120
Adi Shankaracharya,

1596
01:59:00,680 --> 01:59:03,320
who was such a great person but he had to take to sanyasa

1597
01:59:03,520 --> 01:59:05,600
because he had to do the work.

1598
01:59:06,200 --> 01:59:08,080
He’s the one, he said, “Na yoge, na sukhe na"

1599
01:59:08,280 --> 01:59:10,920
by any thinking you do not get it.

1600
01:59:11,240 --> 01:59:14,040
You get it by Mother’s grace.”

1601
01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:18,120
So simple he writes. But look at him,

1602
01:59:18,920 --> 01:59:23,080
when his mother died, they would not allow him to burn the body,

1603
01:59:23,280 --> 01:59:26,760
because they said a sanyasi cannot burn. See this is also an idea.

1604
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:30,240
A sanyasi cannot burn - the idea of a grihasta (householder).

1605
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:33,160
Another idea, you see. Same type.

1606
01:59:33,760 --> 01:59:38,200
So they say, that he burned the body of his mother

1607
01:59:38,520 --> 01:59:41,720
with the banana tree, which never burn.

1608
01:59:42,480 --> 01:59:45,920
And he cursed... I mean they said that he did not curse, but

1609
01:59:46,160 --> 01:59:49,720
it was cursed that they will all bury their dead in their houses.

1610
01:59:49,920 --> 01:59:54,280
And even today you find in Kerala, they do it.

1611
01:59:58,080 --> 02:00:03,000
So, so many people with these ideas have killed so many saints.

1612
02:00:04,120 --> 02:00:06,560
Do not have fixed ideas.

1613
02:00:09,760 --> 02:00:11,920
Sai Nath, so many people

1614
02:00:12,120 --> 02:00:15,960
Sai Nath, they say that, many people say that

1615
02:00:16,200 --> 02:00:20,720
Sai Nath was a realized soul. Not this new one but the Sai Nath.

1616
02:00:22,400 --> 02:00:24,880
But he was a Muslim.

1617
02:00:26,840 --> 02:00:29,120
Kabira was a Muslim

1618
02:00:29,280 --> 02:00:33,000
Still, Nanaka included him in this Guru Granth Sahib.

1619
02:00:33,200 --> 02:00:37,520
Only a realized person can understand who is a realized person.

1620
02:00:38,280 --> 02:00:42,600
Before that, talking about it is just a mental feat.

1621
02:00:42,880 --> 02:00:45,280
By mental feat you are not going to go there.

1622
02:00:45,480 --> 02:00:48,920
Aren’t you tired already of your mental feats? Aren’t you?

1623
02:00:49,760 --> 02:00:52,880
Thinking, thinking, thinking mad?

1624
02:00:54,440 --> 02:00:56,960
One doctor once said, “Mother, you cut my throat,

1625
02:00:57,080 --> 02:01:00,880
do what you like, but stop this thinking.”

1626
02:01:04,480 --> 02:01:09,400
So give up all these ideas that are yours.

1627
02:01:09,680 --> 02:01:16,280
Achieve the Reality, achieve the Reality.

1628
02:01:18,280 --> 02:01:20,240
That is, also, you cannot achieve it,

1629
02:01:20,480 --> 02:01:22,440
the Kundalini is to be awakened,

1630
02:01:22,640 --> 02:01:25,000
somebody will awaken for you,

1631
02:01:25,200 --> 02:01:28,440
and once you get it, you can it do for others.

1632
02:01:28,840 --> 02:01:30,720
You can awaken others. There are so many

1633
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:32,360
who have given Realization here.

1634
02:01:32,480 --> 02:01:36,680
these people are looking so simple and ignorant

1635
02:01:36,880 --> 02:01:39,720
but they know all about it. They are experts.

1636
02:01:41,160 --> 02:01:43,600
Immediately as you were talking, they were all giving

1637
02:01:43,800 --> 02:01:47,040
bandhan on your chakras that were catching.

1638
02:01:48,640 --> 02:01:51,800
They all know. You do not know but they know. All right?

1639
02:01:51,960 --> 02:01:55,560
So with humility you must go and receive your Realization,

1640
02:01:55,760 --> 02:01:59,000
learn all about it and then you give Realization to another person.

1641
02:01:59,280 --> 02:02:01,480
That’s the main thing we have to do today.

1642
02:02:01,880 --> 02:02:05,720
We are not here to save bugs, mosquitoes and chickens!

1643
02:02:23,600 --> 02:02:28,280
I hope nobody is coming out about the support of

1644
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:32,320
smoking some horrible thing like hashish or...

1645
02:02:32,560 --> 02:02:35,160
They smoke or eat I don’t know.

1646
02:02:36,520 --> 02:02:41,640
Like we had a big letter from someone who says that,

1647
02:02:41,840 --> 02:02:44,880
“Mother, people will never understand You unless and until

1648
02:02:45,040 --> 02:02:48,240
they smoke... What is, what is it?

1649
02:02:48,720 --> 02:02:50,720
No, cannabis”.

1650
02:02:50,920 --> 02:02:53,520
I don’t know what is that supposed to be, but they said that,

1651
02:02:53,720 --> 02:02:57,520
“Without that, they cannot understand You and Sahaja Yoga.”

1652
02:02:57,880 --> 02:03:00,680
[Hindi]

1653
02:03:11,880 --> 02:03:15,480
All right? how many have felt cool breeze, the new people?

1654
02:03:15,760 --> 02:03:18,520
Let’s see.

1655
02:03:20,200 --> 02:03:22,200
Cool breeze?

1656
02:03:22,440 --> 02:03:25,120
Did you feel the cool breeze in the hands?

1657
02:03:25,920 --> 02:03:29,560
Yes, I know. Who else? What about you?

1658
02:03:29,720 --> 02:03:32,560
Great. You?

1659
02:03:34,760 --> 02:03:38,160
I am asking this lady.

1660
02:03:38,720 --> 02:03:42,000
You have felt it? Great. What about you?

1661
02:03:42,440 --> 02:03:44,880
Great. Aab dekhiye, ye logon vegetarian nahi,

1662
02:03:45,080 --> 02:03:50,040
aur unko cool breeze aa raha, aur aap ko nahi aa. (meaning: now look,
these people aren’t vegetarians but they felt it and you didn't!)

1663
02:03:50,480 --> 02:03:52,440
What about you?

1664
02:03:52,600 --> 02:03:54,560
Are you feeling cool breeze or not?

1665
02:03:54,760 --> 02:03:58,880
I have already done that. I have had this before.

1666
02:03:59,080 --> 02:04:00,000
But you have lost it.

1667
02:04:00,200 --> 02:04:00,960
No I have not.

1668
02:04:01,280 --> 02:04:02,600
You are getting it now?

1669
02:04:02,760 --> 02:04:04,000
I already had it.

1670
02:04:04,160 --> 02:04:05,120
You never had it.

1671
02:04:05,280 --> 02:04:06,480
I have had it.

1672
02:04:06,680 --> 02:04:08,560
And then what is the situation just now?

1673
02:04:08,760 --> 02:04:10,440
My hands are cool! Is that so?

1674
02:04:10,640 --> 02:04:14,320
No, just see, if he is realized, on top of his head.

1675
02:04:14,720 --> 02:04:17,760
He’s catching on his liver. Hot?

1676
02:04:18,320 --> 02:04:20,840
All right. That’s the compassion!

1677
02:04:24,480 --> 02:04:27,120
The proof of the pudding is there.

1678
02:04:30,080 --> 02:04:33,520
All right. What about you? How did you feel? Good.

1679
02:04:33,960 --> 02:04:37,960
What about you? You were very tensed. What is the problem with you?

1680
02:04:39,280 --> 02:04:40,680
I've come so early when [unclear].

1681
02:04:40,880 --> 02:04:43,040
And then you got nervous.

1682
02:04:43,240 --> 02:04:44,920
I've come really in tense, very much.

1683
02:04:45,040 --> 02:04:47,960
And then what happened? You started thinking about it?

1684
02:04:48,160 --> 02:04:50,680
No, I start feeling [about pain] and uncomfortable.

1685
02:04:50,840 --> 02:04:53,560
I start feeling uncomfortable physically.

1686
02:04:53,720 --> 02:04:54,840
What is it?

1687
02:04:54,960 --> 02:04:57,280
He's not feeling physically comfortable from [unclear].

1688
02:04:57,440 --> 02:05:00,160
I know, then you sit on a chair, there’s no compulsion.

1689
02:05:00,360 --> 02:05:01,880
Please. No, no, you'll be all right.

1690
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:03,360
I tell you, you’ll be better off.

1691
02:05:03,560 --> 02:05:06,120
We have no compulsion like that. You please be seated.

1692
02:05:06,320 --> 02:05:08,440
Yes, come. Come along, sit on the chair. All right.

1693
02:05:08,640 --> 02:05:11,480
That’s a good idea! There is no compulsion.

1694
02:05:11,880 --> 02:05:13,440
You see because the hall is smaller,

1695
02:05:13,560 --> 02:05:16,000
they thought there will be many people so they spread this.

1696
02:05:16,160 --> 02:05:18,240
There’s no compulsion, whether you sit on a chair

1697
02:05:18,360 --> 02:05:20,800
or a throne make no difference.

1698
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:22,400
Makes no difference, it’s not that.

1699
02:05:22,600 --> 02:05:25,960
You see it is the Kundalini is inside, in subtler being,

1700
02:05:26,120 --> 02:05:29,160
it doesn’t mean where you sit.

1701
02:05:29,720 --> 02:05:32,120
Of course it helps, if you sit on the ground, in a way,

1702
02:05:32,280 --> 02:05:34,160
because the Mother Earth helps you, you see.

1703
02:05:34,320 --> 02:05:36,400
If you sit before the light it helps you also.

1704
02:05:36,680 --> 02:05:39,120
That’s a different point. But if you can’t sit on the ground,

1705
02:05:39,240 --> 02:05:40,880
doesn’t matter.

1706
02:05:41,280 --> 02:05:44,600
We have given Realization to people only on sitting on chairs.

1707
02:05:48,320 --> 02:05:51,880
Yes. What to do? All of you got it sitting on chairs, isn’t it?

1708
02:05:53,800 --> 02:05:56,240
About four hundred people, in Vienna,

1709
02:05:56,400 --> 02:05:59,800
got it just like that, sitting on chairs.

1710
02:06:01,640 --> 02:06:03,320
It happens. If it has not happened,

1711
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:06,560
it should happen to every one of you.

1712
02:06:07,880 --> 02:06:11,760
[unclear]

1713
02:06:12,880 --> 02:06:14,960
You tell something more about Kundalini [unclear].

1714
02:06:15,440 --> 02:06:17,880
[Hindi/Marathi]

1715
02:06:18,040 --> 02:06:19,560
There are so many lectures of Mine.

1716
02:06:19,680 --> 02:06:23,120
Today, you see, because I am going away, I’m rather quite full.

1717
02:06:23,320 --> 02:06:27,200
And there are so many lectures I have given on Kundalini,

1718
02:06:27,400 --> 02:06:30,440
you don’t know, I must have spoken at least thousand times.

1719
02:06:31,320 --> 02:06:34,440
In Caxton Hall itself at least six hundred times.

1720
02:06:34,920 --> 02:06:38,560
So there are lectures and lectures, you can see, listen to them.

1721
02:06:38,760 --> 02:06:42,680
But it is Kundalini, by that listening to it, nothing will happen.

1722
02:06:42,880 --> 02:06:47,040
Actually it’s an actualisation. You see it’s like a seed sprouting.

1723
02:06:47,240 --> 02:06:50,360
So by the, talking about Kundalini, nothing happens.

1724
02:06:50,600 --> 02:06:53,520
It has to raise. [Hindi/Marathi]

1725
02:06:54,560 --> 02:06:57,360
[Hindi/Marathi]

1726
02:07:02,360 --> 02:07:05,560
[Hindi/Marathi]

1727
02:07:05,960 --> 02:07:08,560
Shivaji Maharaj and Rana Pratap,

1728
02:07:08,760 --> 02:07:11,440
they were all kshatriyas and they used to eat meat.

1729
02:07:11,640 --> 02:07:13,120
What do you think of Shivaji Maharaj?

1730
02:07:13,280 --> 02:07:17,400
Was he a bad man by any chance? Or Rana Pratap?

1731
02:07:17,680 --> 02:07:20,680
They were not spiritual. They were not spiritual people.

1732
02:07:20,880 --> 02:07:21,920
They were?

1733
02:07:22,040 --> 02:07:23,040
Not spiritual.

1734
02:07:23,200 --> 02:07:24,680
Who? Shivaji?

1735
02:07:24,880 --> 02:07:27,480
Oh, he was very spiritual. That’s the trouble.

1736
02:07:27,720 --> 02:07:29,320
Because you are not a realized soul,

1737
02:07:29,480 --> 02:07:31,760
you cannot feel their vibrations.

1738
02:07:31,920 --> 02:07:33,520
[Hindi/Marathi]

1739
02:07:33,680 --> 02:07:36,880
They are not all, those who take that flag that they are spiritual,

1740
02:07:37,080 --> 02:07:40,200
they are not, mostly. Mostly they are not.

1741
02:07:41,040 --> 02:07:44,640
Mostly they are not, beti. You see, they are very simple people.

1742
02:07:44,920 --> 02:07:47,920
They can be kings, they can be anybody.

1743
02:07:48,840 --> 02:07:52,920
We never understand them, unless and until we have Realization.

1744
02:07:53,360 --> 02:07:58,040
Shri Rama was understood by Shabari,

1745
02:07:58,320 --> 02:08:02,200
but His own father never knew who He was.

1746
02:08:08,760 --> 02:08:11,120
The understanding of the Spirit comes from Spirit only.

1747
02:08:11,320 --> 02:08:12,920
[Sanskrit] (meaning: “Spirit is satisfied by Itself”)

1748
02:08:13,080 --> 02:08:16,560
Atma should know atma, nothing else.

1749
02:08:16,960 --> 02:08:20,480
Through your mental attitude you cannot reach there.

1750
02:08:21,120 --> 02:08:24,000
It’s the Atma knows Atma.

1751
02:08:24,720 --> 02:08:26,240
You ask about Shivaji, all of you ask,

1752
02:08:26,440 --> 02:08:29,880
“Was he a realized soul?” See the vibrations you get.

1753
02:08:33,960 --> 02:08:37,320
Now they can know. Was he?

1754
02:08:39,680 --> 02:08:41,520
Absolutely.

1755
02:08:44,360 --> 02:08:47,720
Now ask, “Was Blake a realized soul?”

1756
02:08:53,120 --> 02:08:55,200
Was he?

1757
02:08:58,880 --> 02:09:01,080
You can feel it.

1758
02:09:06,760 --> 02:09:08,720
It’s sometimes shocking you know,

1759
02:09:08,920 --> 02:09:12,480
to find out about people who are supposed to be very spiritual,

1760
02:09:12,680 --> 02:09:15,400
are not even realized souls, so many!

1761
02:09:15,600 --> 02:09:19,080
Are you from Vallabhacharya? No.

1762
02:09:19,280 --> 02:09:22,200
Vallabhacharya was a great realized soul.

1763
02:09:23,400 --> 02:09:26,800
And when Surdas went to him and he said...

1764
02:09:27,040 --> 02:09:28,680
Surdas is supposed to be very spiritual,

1765
02:09:28,880 --> 02:09:30,880
but he was not a realized soul.

1766
02:09:31,600 --> 02:09:33,480
So Vallabhacharya said to him,

1767
02:09:33,720 --> 02:09:37,640
“Why are you weeping like a baby for God?

1768
02:09:39,200 --> 02:09:43,960
I have found Him. The one who has found doesn’t weep”.

1769
02:09:46,360 --> 02:09:49,320
Spiritual person is that who has found the Spirit.

1770
02:09:49,960 --> 02:09:51,680
You still find it is not spiritual.

1771
02:09:51,880 --> 02:09:54,560
Maybe spiritual in the way that his attitude is,

1772
02:09:54,760 --> 02:09:56,600
but he must find it.

1773
02:09:57,160 --> 02:10:00,800
Then only he’s a really, a spiritual person.

1774
02:10:06,480 --> 02:10:09,120
Even an ordinary person could be a realized soul

1775
02:10:09,320 --> 02:10:11,440
and the king may not be.

1776
02:10:11,680 --> 02:10:13,280
We have so many like this.

1777
02:10:13,440 --> 02:10:15,360
We have so many misnomers in our country

1778
02:10:15,560 --> 02:10:17,960
if you find out, in every country.

1779
02:10:18,600 --> 02:10:21,000
Here also, so many are called as ‘saints’,

1780
02:10:21,200 --> 02:10:23,600
and horrible vibrations come from them.

1781
02:10:23,960 --> 02:10:27,760
They are ‘saints’ you know. Saint this, saint that.

1782
02:10:28,720 --> 02:10:32,320
I don’t know, saints or satans but they are something like that!

1783
02:10:33,200 --> 02:10:37,400
And there are people who are real saints, nobody knows about them!

1784
02:10:38,200 --> 02:10:40,440
How will you make out?

1785
02:10:42,480 --> 02:10:46,280
Only through Atma. The Spirit knows the Spirit.

1786
02:10:47,560 --> 02:10:51,600
Not through mental activity, outward things,

1787
02:10:52,480 --> 02:10:56,600
but through the knowledge that is manifesting,

1788
02:10:58,960 --> 02:11:01,840
the knowledge of Reality, you know the Spirit.

1789
02:11:02,040 --> 02:11:04,680
There’s no other way out.

1790
02:11:07,040 --> 02:11:09,760
That’s a fact.

1791
02:11:14,160 --> 02:11:16,360
All other things are useless

1792
02:11:16,800 --> 02:11:22,200
because, whatever you do in ignorance, are useless.

1793
02:11:22,720 --> 02:11:25,920
But when you have the knowledge of the Spirit

1794
02:11:26,240 --> 02:11:28,520
then you do it

1795
02:11:29,880 --> 02:11:32,800
with your absolute value.

1796
02:11:34,960 --> 02:11:39,280
It does not know any race, any creed, any colour, nothing!

1797
02:11:39,680 --> 02:11:42,160
It knows vibrations.

1798
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:53,240
Is described, everything is described.

1799
02:11:57,600 --> 02:12:00,920
So now, what should we do now at the end when I’m going now?

1800
02:12:01,120 --> 02:12:04,120
Would you like to sing a song to Me? Will they allow us.

1801
02:12:06,720 --> 02:12:07,760
Jerusalem Shri Mataji.

1802
02:12:08,080 --> 02:12:10,560
All right. Close the door. I think they should not say that

1803
02:12:10,800 --> 02:12:14,120
we have misused their liberties.

1804
02:12:21,040 --> 02:12:25,080
[Hindi/Marathi]

1805
02:12:41,040 --> 02:12:43,000
Who will sing it?

1806
02:12:46,240 --> 02:12:48,280
Who will start?

1807
02:15:22,640 --> 02:15:24,720
Thank you very much.
