00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:25.650
Now we all have realized
by this time,

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:36.150
within us lies the peace, the beauty,
the glory of our being.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.240
There's an ocean of all
that.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.820
We cannot seek it outside,

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.780
we have to go within,

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.900
what they call in
the meditative state,

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.110
you seek it, you enjoy it.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.900
Like when you are thirsty,

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:10.530
you go to a river or you
go to a ocean,

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.360
and try to quench
your thirst.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.690
But even the ocean cannot
give you sweet water.

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.650
So how can anything
that is spread outside

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.900
give you that deep thing
that is within you?

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.690
You are trying to find it outside,
where it does not lie.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.240
It is within us, absolutely
with in us.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.950
It is so simple because
it is your own

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.070
it is within your reach,

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.360
just there.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.900
What ever you have
been doing

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.690
going out to find
the joy,

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.200
the so called joy,
the so called happiness,

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:32.240
the so called glory of worldly
powers and wordly possessions,

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.950
you have to reverse it back
the whole thing.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.150
You have to project
within yourself.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.240
It was not wrong
that you went out,

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.780
it was not correct
that you went out,

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.900
shouldn't feel sorry for what
you have done so far.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.690
It was not the correct
way

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.860
to get to the real joy
of life,

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:16.110
the real glory of your
being.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.110
It has worked in so
many people

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:28.070
that you have entered into
that subtler understanding.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.450
Some people are only at a mental
level, maybe, doesn't matter.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:38.490
Maybe, some are only at a physical
level that they can feel it,

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.780
doesn't matter. But, you are
on the correct lines

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.950
you are moving correctly.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.820
Try to meditate,

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.950
meditate more so that you
reach your inner being.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.150
And this inner being, is the
vast ocean of bliss,

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.280
which exists in
every one of us.

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.900
Is that vast glorifying
flood of light

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:14.450
that floods everybody's
inner beauty.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.570
So to approach it,

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:26.610
you have to go within yourself
by denying things,

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.150
which are against it,
against your movement.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.820
Sometimes the wind can be
very, very strong for you

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.070
to misunderstand

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:52.610
that the glory of God
is within.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.740
The turn back,

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:05.030
every moment remember that
your movement has to be inward.

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.150
When you move inward

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.780
you forget the ideas of your
outer glories.

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.780
A person, who is of a very
base nature,

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.070
thinks that if he makes
a lot of money

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.860
then he has achieved
joy, but he has not.

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.690
He's the most unhappy person,
if you go and see him.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.900
He's worried about small,
small things of life.

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.200
You must have heard that people
who are very rich

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.110
are kleptomaniacs.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.570
They're worried, they're
very miserly,

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.360
they're worried about a needle
here and there.

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:49.280
A little thing missing they
get upset.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.450
They have so many habits that
they can't live without it.

00:05:53.690 --> 00:06:00.110
So riches have brought always
a curse on human beings.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.450
So those who seek only
the riches

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:09.110
cannot enjoy them.

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.900
Then there are some
better people,

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.490
who think that by
ruling others,

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:20.610
by getting power,
they can achieve

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:25.530
very great position in life,

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.150
they too assume, fail.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.150
You have seen what
happens to them,

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:35.110
people don't even want
to talk about them.

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:40.900
Now there are people
who get attached to someone

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.400
to one person or to the family, to
their children, to their relations,

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:47.820
very common in India.

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:52.860
That's also not the way you
can get to God,

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:56.740
that's also so limited,

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:59.780
keeps you hanging
round them

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:05.690
and wasting your energy
completely.

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:16.740
But if you enter into
your being fully,

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:21.320
then all these things have
such meaning;

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:24.240
everything has
a meaning then.

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:27.990
In a sense if you posses
anything,

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:32.610
and if you're that kind of a person
who is supposed to keep possessing,

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:38.900
he never possesses,
he's so detached.

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:43.650
He's never possessive;
he's so detached about it.

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:47.240
But, he can play around, because
he's so detached,

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:50.570
he can create a drama
out of it.

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:55.900
He can play with
the possessions,

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:59.070
and teach lots of lessons
to people,

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:06.570
HeÂ´s so detached, so generous,
he enjoys his generosity.

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:12.990
The whole thing becomes
so different so dynamic.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.690
All the beauty that is created
by human beings,

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:21.200
as possession is exposed
before you

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:26.530
and you start enjoying
all those things

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.950
without possessing them.

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:35.200
You understand the myth
of possession.

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:42.690
Same with your powers that people
have over other people.

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:48.070
Those who try to make
money out of Sahaja Yoga,

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:53.030
or want to have a kind
of a privilege over Sahaja Yoga

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:57.360
can be subtle, this can
go very far.

00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:59.700
This subtlety goes to
this extent

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:06.280
that I've seen people try to save
money on account of Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:12.110
That's also the attention
is on money.

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:16.740
To make money or
to save money,

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:21.070
to make a business out of
Sahaja Yoga is all absurd,

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:24.240
but if you say so I say,
"All right go ahead for a while,

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:29.900
try. You'll find that Sahaja Yoga
is no business."

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:35.110
Of course Sahaja Yogis
can work together,

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.280
can do some business,
but Sahaja Yoga is no business.

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:41.820
Is business of God,

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:46.610
where you have to give
everything that you have,

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:49.740
not ot be attached
to anything,

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:51.900
not to be attached.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:54.360
There's no money
to be paid as such,

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:58.150
but all your heart has
to be poured into it.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.280
If you cannot pour your
heart into it

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:05.690
you cannot achieve.

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.690
Same about power.

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:10.690
Some people think

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:13.240
that they can even overpower
Sahaja Yogis,

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:17.820
impress them, control them,

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:23.530
such people are thrown out of
Sahaja Yoga completely.

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:29.200
You have to enjoy
the power of love,

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:33.070
that people see you as
their protector,

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:36.690
as their help, as their
support,

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:42.360
as their friend,

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:47.200
than somebody who is
a dominating personality.

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:57.690
You have to be a father head and
not a demonic destructive force,

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:00.070
which is always threatening
everyone.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:03.900
Such people will be thrown out
of Sahaja Yoga in no time.

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:05.610
You are found out.

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:09.780
I have  no sympathies
with such people, never,

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:15.150
that will bring you down,
in no way.

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:18.650
Keep your self aloof
with them,

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:24.490
otherwise when they are thrown
away as tangents from Sahaja Yoga

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:26.820
you might get out
with them,

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:30.690
so be careful.

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:34.650
Then those people who waste
all their time

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:38.070
just thinking about
their family, this thing,

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.740
or those who have never
thought of their family,

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:42.820
also come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:45.990
This is a very subtler
ground

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:52.690
on which they can loose
their attention to their Spirit.

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:58.690
They spoil their children, they spoil
their husbands, they spoil their wives.

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:04.450
The whole attention
goes in a wrong way

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:07.280
and it becomes a very
important issue with them,

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:11.450
how the marriages are successful, how
the children are this thing, that thing.

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:13.240
They don't leave it to God.

00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:16.110
They have to leave it to God.
We are all Saints,

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:20.320
you have to leave every
thing to God.

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:23.450
In the beginning in Sahaja Yoga
everybody says,

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:27.400
"My husband is like that, my wife is
like that, my brother is like that,

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:29.740
my children are like this.
Mother look after them,"

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:32.030
all right in the beginning,
is all right.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.690
When you grow you
must get out of it.

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:40.950
It's an individual journey towards
God when you meditate,

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:44.900
and when you reach there
then you become collective.

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:51.030
Before that, it's an absolute
individual journey within,

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.900
absolutely individual journey.

00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:58.570
You should be able to
see this.

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:04.860
You are in this journey
nobody is your relation

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:08.860
nobody is your brother, nobody
is your friend,

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:13.200
you're absolutely alone,

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:16.610
absolutely alone.

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:20.200
You have to move alone
within yourself.

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:24.280
Don't hate anyone,
don't be responsible,

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:28.320
but in meditative mood
you're alone.

00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:32.110
No one exists there,
you alone,

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:35.860
and once you enter
into that ocean

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:39.070
then the whole world
becomes your family.

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:45.820
The whole world is your
own manifestation.

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:50.320
All the children become
your children

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:58.360
and you treat all people with
equal understanding.

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:09.280
The whole expansion takes place when
you enter inside your Spirit

00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:15.490
and see starting through
the eyes of the Spirit.

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:23.400
Such calm, such peace,
such bliss exists within you.

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:30.110
You have to be ready
for that journey.

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:42.150
That journey is alone in
your meditativeness

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.400
and the more you find something
in your meditation

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:48.320
the more you want to go
and distribute it to others.

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:50.530
That has to,

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:54.150
if that does not come into you
then it has not worked out.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:59.780
There is no purity, there's
some sort of a bias.

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:02.950
In that individual pursuit,
what ever you find,

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:06.150
you want to enjoy
it with others,

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:07.820
want to give it to others.

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:12.360
This is the sign of a person who
has been really meditating.

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:14.650
The one who is meditative

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:19.570
and has not been able to
distribute  what he has found,

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:27.200
is cheating himself and
cheating others as well.

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:32.570
Because that joy that you
receive in your meditation

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:40.240
has to be distributed, has
to be given, has to be shown.

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:43.740
It should flow in your
being

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:50.400
as a light radiates from
every illumined lamp.

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:52.690
We don't have to take
a vow

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:55.240
to say this is an enlightened
light,

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:56.610
in the same way,

00:15:56.780 --> 00:16:01.070
a saint should not be certified
that he is a saint.

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:06.900
The depth you achieve within
yourself spreads all over,

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:10.320
it is such an action
and reaction.

00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:14.780
The more deeper you become
the radiation is much more.

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:18.820
A simple person, very
ordinary person,

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:23.780
uneducated person,
can be like that.

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:28.450
We have you know, one
gentleman called Vardic in Bombay

00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:34.530
he's an old man,
he's so deep, he radiates.

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:39.570
People depend on him,
he radiates love,

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:41.110
so meditative.

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:45.650
You don't have to spend too
much time on meditation,

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:50.900
but what ever you spend time,
what ever you gain

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:54.450
is has to be visible
outside,

00:16:54.650 --> 00:17:02.070
how you radiate and how
you give it to others.

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:06.900
That's the quality of the
saints you have to be.

00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:11.360
Unless and until you become deeper,
we cannot save other Sahaja Yogis

00:17:11.570 --> 00:17:15.150
and we cannot save those
who are not Sahaja Yogis.

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:24.530
You have to rise higher and higher
to pull the whole curtain up.

00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:30.030
Those who try to rise
higher

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:33.070
pull the whole thing
upward

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:38.530
and they give a pull to everyone
who ascend with them.

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:43.690
So just try to keep your
aim clear cut.

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:46.650
Must understand what is
your aim in life as Sahaja Yogis.

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:48.450
Now you are changed
people.

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:52.070
You are no more people who have
to deal with possessions

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:58.200
worry about them, about mundane
things, about your livelihoods.

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:00.450
You are no more people
who have to worry too much

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:04.900
about your health and things
or your personal lives.

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:09.950
You are not to worry also
about your jobs so much,

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:13.400
that's not important

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:18.740
and last of all not to
worry about your family,

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:21.690
children, husband, wife

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:27.690
and find a pocket
for you to hide into it.

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:30.990
Because the only thing where
you can really hide yourself

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:36.400
is the love of God, where
you can really get

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:40.900
the great restful, blissful,
feeling

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:46.360
of his complete protection.

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:53.900
Sydney has done very well before
and it's progressing better,

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:56.950
but the pace is not
as it should be.

00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:59.450
So we have to think of new
ways and methods

00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:02.110
how we can spread this.

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:06.240
But first you must assume
your positions as you are.

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:09.450
You must assume that
you are all saints

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:11.900
that you have to
do great work -

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:16.820
not the ego part of it,
but the manifestation of it.

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:21.740
Every one of you has
to decide for oneself.

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:24.690
I'm sure it's going
to work out,

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:30.200
and this time My visit is going
to help you a lot by understanding

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:37.950
what is the best to spread
this light all.

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:42.030
May God bless you.
