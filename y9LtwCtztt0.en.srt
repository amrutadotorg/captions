1
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:17,652
Today, we are going to do Puja to Shiva,
Shri Shiva.

2
00:00:19,141 --> 00:00:30,748
As you know Shri Shiva is the reflection
of Sadashiva within us.

3
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:35,418
I have already told about the reflection.

4
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:40,990
Sadashiva is the God Almighty,

5
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:50,619
the One who sees the play of Adi Shakti.

6
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:56,816
But He is the Father

7
00:00:59,466 --> 00:01:07,620
who is watching each one of His Creation
or Her Creation.

8
00:01:09,113 --> 00:01:21,507
His support to Adi Shakti is entirely,
fully strengthening.

9
00:01:22,912 --> 00:01:32,178
Thereâ€™s no doubt in His mind about
the capability of the Adi Shakti.

10
00:01:32,837 --> 00:01:41,395
But when He finds that, in the play
of Adi Shakti,

11
00:01:43,211 --> 00:01:52,623
the people of the world as such, try
to disturb Her,

12
00:01:52,824 --> 00:02:01,628
or spoil Her work then He gets
into His wrathful mood

13
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:11,982
and He destroys all such people and maybe
He destroys the whole world.

14
00:02:16,693 --> 00:02:20,157
On one side He is wrathful no doubt,

15
00:02:20,358 --> 00:02:27,673
on the other side He's the ocean
of compassion and joy.

16
00:02:28,658 --> 00:02:33,734
That's why when He's reflected within us

17
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:41,126
we get our Self-realization. We get
the light of our spirit

18
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:48,687
and we get into the ocean of joy.

19
00:02:48,972 --> 00:02:54,281
Also He is the ocean of knowledge,

20
00:02:54,482 --> 00:03:02,422
So, those who get self-realized get
the knowledge of the Divine,

21
00:03:03,081 --> 00:03:13,663
which is very subtle, permeating into every
atom and molecule,

22
00:03:14,314 --> 00:03:20,903
the power of this knowledge is there.

23
00:03:21,874 --> 00:03:26,915
Now we should know what is this
Realization we have got.

24
00:03:27,116 --> 00:03:30,697
What does that mean and what is
the culminating point.

25
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,066
Now the first step is to become
thoughtlessly aware,

26
00:03:37,267 --> 00:03:43,047
where you cross your mind. You go above
your mind.

27
00:03:43,248 --> 00:03:49,106
Mind cannot affect you. This is the first
stage as we call is thoughtless awareness.

28
00:03:49,307 --> 00:03:55,718
Second one is where, you see, start seeing
the working of this Paramachaitanya,

29
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:00,990
of this all-pervading Power and you start
becoming aware

30
00:04:01,191 --> 00:04:08,945
that there is lot of truth in what Mataji
says.

31
00:04:09,146 --> 00:04:14,161
That there is this power, which works out
many things.

32
00:04:14,362 --> 00:04:18,020
It works miraculously so many things
for you.

33
00:04:18,221 --> 00:04:25,535
It gives you blessings, it guides you,
it helps you, in so many ways it helps you.

34
00:04:25,736 --> 00:04:32,355
It gives you good health, good wealth and
also a very good society

35
00:04:32,556 --> 00:04:36,836
of very beautiful people in the collective.

36
00:04:37,037 --> 00:04:40,556
All that you can see clearly is happening
here.

37
00:04:41,049 --> 00:04:46,937
Now this main question today, which
I'm going to tell you about

38
00:04:47,132 --> 00:04:52,933
that what is God's realization. First is
the Self-realization

39
00:04:53,134 --> 00:04:57,982
and there are many ambitious people who
want to become God's-realized.

40
00:04:58,183 --> 00:05:03,755
First and foremost thing we should know
that human beings cannot become God.

41
00:05:03,956 --> 00:05:06,760
It's not the becoming of it.

42
00:05:06,961 --> 00:05:13,250
You have not become also in a way spirit
because the spirit is emitting through you,

43
00:05:13,451 --> 00:05:18,138
using you, giving you, looking after you.

44
00:05:20,641 --> 00:05:24,809
If you become the spirit there won't be
any body left, nothing will be left.

45
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:29,809
So with this body intact, your spirit
is acting through this body,

46
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:33,545
is giving you all the light.

47
00:05:33,956 --> 00:05:39,757
But one cannot become God Almighty; this
one has to understand very clearly.

48
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:45,319
But what is God's realization is to know
about God.

49
00:05:46,874 --> 00:05:56,210
You see, to know about God means to know
how His powers are working.

50
00:05:58,265 --> 00:06:05,511
How He controls by becoming part and parcel
of God Almighty.

51
00:06:05,712 --> 00:06:14,004
Like My finger doesn't know about My brain,
but it acts according to My brain.

52
00:06:14,205 --> 00:06:17,655
The finger cannot become the brain,

53
00:06:17,856 --> 00:06:23,136
but it has to act absolutely according
to My brain

54
00:06:23,337 --> 00:06:27,558
because it is so connected, it is so one.

55
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:34,121
Here when you have the God's realization
then you know about the brain,

56
00:06:34,322 --> 00:06:41,947
you know about God, you know about His
powers, you know everything about Him.

57
00:06:42,148 --> 00:06:48,684
As far as I'm concerned it's a difficult
task for you, because I'm a Mahamaya.

58
00:06:48,885 --> 00:06:52,594
It's very difficult for you to know each
and everything about Me.

59
00:06:52,795 --> 00:06:57,836
I'm quite a elusive person as you know that
well,

60
00:06:58,037 --> 00:07:06,038
and whatever I do or whatever I achieve,
it is just for you to see and understand

61
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:11,800
that after all this is Adi Shakti and She
can do all these things.

62
00:07:12,001 --> 00:07:16,538
You can also do all the things but you
cannot become Me.

63
00:07:16,739 --> 00:07:25,900
But you have to know, to know through
love, through devotion, through prayers

64
00:07:26,101 --> 00:07:31,821
to know the God's Powers is the way you are
God-realized.

65
00:07:32,022 --> 00:07:37,029
Then you can control the nature, you can
control everything,

66
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:41,532
if you have that knowledge within you
about God.

67
00:07:41,733 --> 00:07:47,734
For that a complete humility is needed that
you cannot become God,

68
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:51,779
cannot become God Almighty. You cannot
become the deities

69
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:58,376
but definitely you can become God-realized.
Means God acts through you,

70
00:07:58,577 --> 00:08:04,834
uses you as His power, as His channel and
that you know, that you know

71
00:08:05,035 --> 00:08:09,070
what He's doing to you, what He's telling,
what His vision is

72
00:08:09,271 --> 00:08:13,947
and what is the information. The connection
is like that.

73
00:08:14,148 --> 00:08:18,758
Many people in Sahaja Yoga have been
benefited, I know.

74
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:23,132
But they don't know how they have been
benefited. What has worked it out?

75
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:27,991
How it has worked it out. What connection
of theirs has helped them?

76
00:08:28,192 --> 00:08:35,319
Once you do that, you know that, clearly
how things are working out,

77
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:42,046
with what power you have achieved it, then
it's a God's realization.

78
00:08:42,247 --> 00:08:47,308
Such people become extremely powerful
in the sense

79
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:52,504
that they can control so many things.

80
00:08:54,948 --> 00:08:58,004
There have been many saints of that kind

81
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:04,451
but sometimes they fell from even that and
they developed their ego.

82
00:09:04,652 --> 00:09:07,919
They didn't have their own humility that
they should have,

83
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:13,452
that devotion, that dedication, that
surrendering.

84
00:09:13,874 --> 00:09:19,673
They fell down and you see them, I've seen
some of them that they become

85
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:25,378
quite proud of their achievements and they
don't want to give it to anyone.

86
00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:28,034
They think they have achieved it with great difficulties

87
00:09:28,227 --> 00:09:35,016
and why should they give it to others. Such
people are not going to rise very higher.

88
00:09:35,217 --> 00:09:40,360
But you people who have got your realization
and who are humble,

89
00:09:40,561 --> 00:09:49,204
who know that out of humility only you are
going to achieve your surrendering.

90
00:09:49,405 --> 00:09:54,536
Islam means surrender. Mohammed Sahib has
talked about Islam,

91
00:09:54,737 --> 00:10:00,303
meaning, "you surrender." If you cannot
surrender you can never know God.

92
00:10:00,504 --> 00:10:04,105
Is clearly said that, "Unless and until you
know yourself

93
00:10:04,306 --> 00:10:07,523
you will not know about God."

94
00:10:07,724 --> 00:10:14,013
So as Sahajis you have to know all
the little, little things,

95
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:18,643
all the big things, and all the great
visions,

96
00:10:18,844 --> 00:10:26,457
that you can do it because of the grace
of God, because His blessings,

97
00:10:26,658 --> 00:10:33,916
because of His love for you, that you have
entered into the Kingdom of God.

98
00:10:34,117 --> 00:10:40,104
I may say you have entered, I may say you
have achieved that state,

99
00:10:40,305 --> 00:10:46,906
I may say that. But still you are not
there.

100
00:10:47,107 --> 00:10:52,086
It's like if I tell somebody, "Now you are
in Australia."

101
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:55,546
He's not in Australia, but I can say you
are in Australia.

102
00:10:55,747 --> 00:10:58,310
So he believes, "I am in Australia", that's
not the way.

103
00:10:58,511 --> 00:11:03,434
You have to be in Australia, then you have
to know about Australia.

104
00:11:03,635 --> 00:11:08,551
You have to know what sort of climate
it is, what sort of things it is.

105
00:11:09,032 --> 00:11:14,267
One flight is up to the thoughtless
awareness.

106
00:11:14,468 --> 00:11:19,667
The second one is up to the doubtless
awareness

107
00:11:19,868 --> 00:11:23,949
and the third one is to God's realization.

108
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:29,449
I've seen people who are very close to Me
also don't understand.

109
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:33,864
They behave in such a manner as if now
they've become gods.

110
00:11:34,065 --> 00:11:40,880
So egoistical they are that I am amazed at
them. Then they have to leave Sahaja Yoga.

111
00:11:41,058 --> 00:11:48,553
So you see, even if I praise you too much,
if I say anything too much,

112
00:11:48,754 --> 00:11:53,585
you shouldn't get pampered. It's a testing
ground.

113
00:11:53,786 --> 00:11:59,331
Or otherwise also if I tell you that,

114
00:11:59,532 --> 00:12:04,857
"This is not good, you should improve
on this", you shouldn't mind,

115
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:11,999
because I have to do it, that's My job.
And your job is to listen to Me.

116
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,369
Because I have nothing to gain from you.
I do not ask for anything.

117
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:23,326
What I want is you all should get all My
powers. You may not become what I am,

118
00:12:23,527 --> 00:12:28,544
agreed, but please try to get all
the powers that I have.

119
00:12:28,745 --> 00:12:31,604
Which is not a difficult thing.

120
00:12:31,805 --> 00:12:39,331
This is what is God's realization. That's
what is to know Shiva and Sadashiva.

121
00:12:39,532 --> 00:12:43,412
Through the Shiva you know Sadashiva.
You see the reflection

122
00:12:43,613 --> 00:12:50,685
and from reflection you know who is
the original.

123
00:12:50,886 --> 00:12:57,930
From the reflection you learn. Thus you
reach that state where you think

124
00:12:58,131 --> 00:13:02,643
you are now definitely settled
in the Kingdom of God

125
00:13:02,844 --> 00:13:09,418
and that you can see God, you can feel God,

126
00:13:09,619 --> 00:13:12,916
you can understand God.

127
00:13:14,528 --> 00:13:18,120
And you can love God.

128
00:13:18,321 --> 00:13:20,571
So may God bless you.
