00:08:18.784 --> 00:08:23.367
1987-0516 Shri Ganesha Puja, Auckland (New Zealand)

00:13:07.795 --> 00:13:15.319
I think it was, very nice that I could come to New Zealand.

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:21.764
You should not feel depressed or unhappy,

00:13:21.885 --> 00:13:25.875
that the program started with a big bang and then it subsided

00:13:25.995 --> 00:13:30.250
then its coming up and all that. This is a common thing.

00:13:30.371 --> 00:13:34.559
Because it is a living process. In every living process,

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.924
the thing starts with a very small thing.

00:13:38.044 --> 00:13:46.038
And then it grows, according to the weight, that one can, bear.

00:13:46.403 --> 00:13:51.870
You see the little tree, or when it was just a sampling,

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:55.255
it had to fight a lot to come up.

00:13:55.375 --> 00:14:01.298
And when it came up, then also, it would not bear fruits.

00:14:01.418 --> 00:14:04.995
It would only bear two leaves, you see, to open out.

00:14:05.115 --> 00:14:10.372
Because the stock was not so powerful to hold the whole thing.

00:14:10.492 --> 00:14:14.267
So when your Sahaja Yogis will be more, and ready,

00:14:14.387 --> 00:14:17.134
then you’ll get more people and more people.

00:14:17.254 --> 00:14:20.884
But one should not expect too much of quantity.

00:14:21.004 --> 00:14:23.435
What we need is quality.

00:14:23.555 --> 00:14:28.495
If you try for quantity, then there would be a problem.

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:33.122
Because quantity, the quality will go down.

00:14:33.242 --> 00:14:35.632
So in the beginning, when it is the foundation,

00:14:35.752 --> 00:14:39.060
it is very important to have good quality.

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:41.167
As you see in a house,

00:14:41.287 --> 00:14:45.602
in the foundation we always put, very heavy stones,

00:14:45.722 --> 00:14:48.141
which can bear the whole structure.

00:14:48.261 --> 00:14:51.474
In the same way, in the beginning of Sahaja Yoga,

00:14:51.594 --> 00:14:57.000
we have to put very solid people, to work it out.

00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:01.768
Unless and until they are of a very solid nature, they’re thrown out.

00:15:01.888 --> 00:15:04.786
That’s why Christ has said, first could be the last.

00:15:04.906 --> 00:15:07.759
Because so many people come for the first time,

00:15:07.879 --> 00:15:10.707
and may just get lost. Because they are no good.

00:15:10.827 --> 00:15:13.176
They have to bear the structure.

00:15:13.296 --> 00:15:15.801
They cannot be ordinary Sahaja Yogis.

00:15:15.921 --> 00:15:22.589
Now we have many qualities, to, to make it really,

00:15:22.709 --> 00:15:30.559
very very strong and also, to make it bearing.

00:15:30.679 --> 00:15:35.113
First of all, a Sahaja Yogi, which is on in the foundation

00:15:35.233 --> 00:15:40.316
doesn’t show off. He bears, he holds.

00:15:41.157 --> 00:15:46.204
He is the, actually the Adhara as they say, the support.

00:15:46.324 --> 00:15:49.526
The complete support of Sahaja Yoga in a country.

00:15:49.646 --> 00:15:52.284
So the first few, you come to the Sahaja Yoga,

00:15:52.404 --> 00:15:54.903
are very very important people.

00:15:55.023 --> 00:15:57.854
And an intensive work has to be done on them.

00:15:57.974 --> 00:16:01.267
And they have to work out also intensively.

00:16:01.387 --> 00:16:02.834
Because the first ones,

00:16:02.954 --> 00:16:06.950
if they are weak, the whole thing topples down.

00:16:07.227 --> 00:16:11.114
So by some mistake, you see, some weak persons may join you.

00:16:11.234 --> 00:16:13.208
Then the whole thing will topple down.

00:16:13.329 --> 00:16:16.606
Again you’ll have to raise it. It’s like another resurrection.

00:16:16.726 --> 00:16:20.069
Then again you have to see that you don’t have weak people there.

00:16:20.189 --> 00:16:22.561
Then you have to build them up in such a manner

00:16:22.681 --> 00:16:25.791
that they grow properly

00:16:25.911 --> 00:16:30.401
to the size that can bear the whole structure.

00:16:30.521 --> 00:16:32.439
Later on, of course, you’ll be surprised,

00:16:32.559 --> 00:16:36.501
the structure grows very fast. Like in Australia

00:16:36.621 --> 00:16:41.761
you know we started in a very, very, poor way, to begin with.

00:16:41.881 --> 00:16:45.363
And the people who really started are out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:45.483 --> 00:16:48.854
Absolutely out. And the rest of them,

00:16:48.974 --> 00:16:52.889
out of them also, those who were really solid people,

00:16:53.009 --> 00:16:58.138
could form the foundation of Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:59.297 --> 00:17:02.711
So, one has to be careful, as to understand,

00:17:02.831 --> 00:17:06.975
that what we need now is quality, not the quantity.

00:17:07.095 --> 00:17:09.857
If you have too many people around your heads,

00:17:09.977 --> 00:17:12.201
you won’t be able to manage them at all.

00:17:12.321 --> 00:17:15.505
But if you have few good people you should be thankful.

00:17:15.625 --> 00:17:19.865
That’s why, if, there is no publicity that has come,

00:17:19.985 --> 00:17:24.635
or there are small number of people, you should be very satisfied.

00:17:24.755 --> 00:17:26.551
Not to feel sad about it,

00:17:26.671 --> 00:17:29.212
that see now, Sahaja Yoga is not spreading.

00:17:29.332 --> 00:17:32.213
It’s not the spreading that is important now.

00:17:32.333 --> 00:17:38.574
Is the deeper, embeddiment, that is important.

00:17:38.694 --> 00:17:42.456
And for that we need really solid people for Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:42.576 --> 00:17:46.109
So, you are the first, few people here,

00:17:46.229 --> 00:17:48.792
who are going to form the foundation,

00:17:48.912 --> 00:17:51.600
of New Zealand’s Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:55.526
Maybe one day it might be a very very big structure.

00:17:55.646 --> 00:17:59.297
Doesn’t matter. Maybe your, you might be, taking a role

00:17:59.417 --> 00:18:02.793
of a foundation, which doesn’t show off.

00:18:03.373 --> 00:18:07.284
But your names will be written in golden letters,

00:18:07.633 --> 00:18:10.517
that such people started Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:10.637 --> 00:18:13.124
Because it’s a big struggle in the beginning to

00:18:13.244 --> 00:18:15.236
implement Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:15.847 --> 00:18:21.297
Now I have seen that people, who are false spread very fast.

00:18:21.417 --> 00:18:24.221
Very fast. You’ll hear their names everywhere,

00:18:24.341 --> 00:18:26.381
suddenly you see it’s all going everywhere.

00:18:26.501 --> 00:18:29.624
And you’ll be surprised that they are in the market already.

00:18:29.744 --> 00:18:33.398
The reason is, that, is not a living process.

00:18:34.192 --> 00:18:35.820
Is just Plastics.

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:40.912
Plastic flower you can produce, in 1 day, thousands.

00:18:41.032 --> 00:18:44.702
But to produce 1 flower, on a tree,

00:18:45.202 --> 00:18:47.945
first flower is so difficult.

00:18:48.065 --> 00:18:51.759
Then few flowers, then the blossom time comes.

00:18:51.879 --> 00:18:55.357
Is not, that suddenly you get many flowers.

00:18:55.477 --> 00:18:59.146
So one has to understand that, in the beginning of anything,

00:18:59.266 --> 00:19:02.629
there are difficulties, and there are problems.

00:19:02.749 --> 00:19:04.279
Funny people will come in,

00:19:04.399 --> 00:19:06.629
they start doubting, they’ll go out.

00:19:06.749 --> 00:19:09.453
Then some more will come, they will get into it,

00:19:09.573 --> 00:19:11.827
they will do this, and they’ll get out.

00:19:11.947 --> 00:19:15.101
So there are two forces always working in Sahaja Yoga:

00:19:15.221 --> 00:19:18.383
one is the centripetal, another is centrifugal.

00:19:18.503 --> 00:19:21.681
By one force, people are attracted towards to Sahaja Yoga,

00:19:21.801 --> 00:19:23.435
because they know it’s the truth.

00:19:23.555 --> 00:19:26.054
And this is the end of their seeking.

00:19:26.174 --> 00:19:29.451
And this, they have to have. Because they, find out

00:19:29.571 --> 00:19:33.549
through their pure intelligence that this is the way.

00:19:33.669 --> 00:19:36.076
Now there are people who just try to test,

00:19:36.196 --> 00:19:38.493
like guru shopping you see. So they think:

00:19:38.613 --> 00:19:42.006
“let us go this shop is, they don’t charge you anything.

00:19:42.126 --> 00:19:43.129
Let’s get in here”.

00:19:43.249 --> 00:19:46.808
but they are the people, who just do not stick-on sometime.

00:19:46.928 --> 00:19:50.129
Or they have too many problems, from other gurus maybe.

00:19:50.249 --> 00:19:52.244
Or maybe they may stick-on.

00:19:52.364 --> 00:19:55.922
And some of them who stick-on, stick-on very well.

00:19:56.042 --> 00:20:00.235
So, we cannot say, what immediately will happen,

00:20:00.355 --> 00:20:03.420
in a living process you can’t say this tree,

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:04.725
which side it will take?

00:20:04.845 --> 00:20:07.283
Whether it will go straight or on the sides

00:20:07.403 --> 00:20:09.025
or it will move the other way.

00:20:09.145 --> 00:20:11.303
So, it is, you cannot say that way.

00:20:11.423 --> 00:20:17.062
But we can say one thing, that, at least from my experience,

00:20:17.182 --> 00:20:20.767
I feel that in the beginning, whatever starts in a small way,

00:20:20.887 --> 00:20:24.539
in a struggling way, really is embedding itself nicely,

00:20:24.659 --> 00:20:26.452
into the Mother Earth.

00:20:26.572 --> 00:20:28.138
And is a very good sign.

00:20:28.258 --> 00:20:31.714
Because that’s the way, it always works out better.

00:20:31.834 --> 00:20:34.733
Whatever is frivolous, or whatever is cheapish,

00:20:34.853 --> 00:20:39.855
or which spreads out without much difficulties, is of no use.

00:20:39.975 --> 00:20:44.060
It’s like grass. Anybody can take it away.

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:47.174
So the embeddiment and all that, has to go inside.

00:20:47.294 --> 00:20:49.924
As you are shaking it nicely to go inside.

00:20:50.044 --> 00:20:53.364
And that’s what it is. Where, you should be very happy,

00:20:53.484 --> 00:20:55.079
that it is working out that way.

00:20:55.199 --> 00:21:01.331
Somebody has come? Let him come. Come along.

00:21:08.736 --> 00:21:15.648
So the beginning of Sahaja Yoga, may look to be little shaky.

00:21:15.768 --> 00:21:19.149
May look to be little feeble. But it is not.

00:21:19.269 --> 00:21:22.401
It is getting stronger and stronger.

00:21:22.521 --> 00:21:26.452
And it is getting embedded into the Mother Earth.

00:21:26.572 --> 00:21:31.578
And, that is what, is the test of you being the real seekers.

00:21:31.698 --> 00:21:35.272
You being the people who want truth.

00:21:35.392 --> 00:21:39.330
Who do not want a big show, big,

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:43.033
sort of a, community sitting there,

00:21:43.153 --> 00:21:48.643
all going mad with some sort of a shouting, screaming and nonsense.

00:21:48.763 --> 00:21:52.553
As it is you know, Sahaja Yoga, is a living process.

00:21:52.673 --> 00:21:55.952
And, it goes both, grows both, both ways.

00:21:56.072 --> 00:21:58.503
Upwards and downwards.

00:21:58.623 --> 00:22:01.173
In the beginning it grows more downwards,

00:22:01.293 --> 00:22:04.325
and in the downwards process, we have to depend,

00:22:04.459 --> 00:22:08.577
on our vibrations very much. We must all the time remember,

00:22:08.697 --> 00:22:13.248
that we are realized souls. That we have got vibrations.

00:22:13.368 --> 00:22:15.396
This is the way we have to judge.

00:22:15.516 --> 00:22:17.666
This is the way we have to understand.

00:22:17.786 --> 00:22:22.163
The vibration is the only way, that we’ll know others.

00:22:22.283 --> 00:22:26.230
Not by something, something you will feel

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:29.294
that the person looks very sweet and nice and,

00:22:29.414 --> 00:22:31.640
may a snake come out of that person.

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:35.543
So best is, to judge a person, through vibrations.

00:22:35.663 --> 00:22:37.825
Judge everything through vibrations.

00:22:37.945 --> 00:22:40.492
Not through your own understanding,

00:22:40.612 --> 00:22:44.456
or superficial methods of judging others.

00:22:44.576 --> 00:22:47.658
Now, there are also so many conditionings we have got,

00:22:47.778 --> 00:22:52.335
by which we judge others. And these conditionings, can also,

00:22:52.455 --> 00:22:57.219
bias our judgment. So best way is to see the vibrations.

00:22:57.339 --> 00:23:00.300
Through vibrations, you will have the real knowledge

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:02.260
about what is happening.

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:06.736
Now many people, in the beginning, also start misguiding.

00:23:06.856 --> 00:23:09.810
So best is to develop your vibrations.

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:12.422
For that you have to grow inward first of all.

00:23:12.542 --> 00:23:17.217
If you grow inward, deeply, then what will happen,

00:23:17.337 --> 00:23:22.750
that outward growth will be very solid, and would be exact.

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:24.931
You won’t have any problems with that.

00:23:25.051 --> 00:23:26.804
But if you do not grow inward,

00:23:26.924 --> 00:23:29.870
if you do not meditate and pay attention to it,

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:35.295
and, I would say, it is more the dedication that you have,

00:23:35.415 --> 00:23:40.206
that works out so well that you grow upwards so well.

00:23:40.326 --> 00:23:43.786
I mean you can give a speech whenever you want about Sahaja Yoga,

00:23:43.906 --> 00:23:46.572
you can give realization to people whenever you want,

00:23:46.692 --> 00:23:48.908
you can cure people whenever you want.

00:23:49.028 --> 00:23:51.433
But first, there should be a depth in you.

00:23:51.553 --> 00:23:53.237
If that you have not achieved,

00:23:53.357 --> 00:23:55.792
you just start superficially doing something.

00:23:55.912 --> 00:23:59.428
Then maybe you are hit, or maybe you are in trouble,

00:23:59.548 --> 00:24:04.659
or maybe you may start doubting yourself, maybe Sahaja Yoga too.

00:24:04.779 --> 00:24:08.866
So the first thing is for us to grow deeply.

00:24:08.986 --> 00:24:12.813
And while we are growing deeply, we have to also grow

00:24:12.933 --> 00:24:18.049
in such a manner that we understand our vibrations clearly.

00:24:18.169 --> 00:24:22.535
Now see a root, of a little plant,

00:24:22.655 --> 00:24:27.296
has a got a very small little cell at the base of it.

00:24:27.416 --> 00:24:30.449
And the plant, doesn’t know anything,

00:24:30.569 --> 00:24:33.044
as much as that little cell knows.

00:24:33.164 --> 00:24:38.534
Because it is going inside, by its own intelligence,

00:24:38.654 --> 00:24:40.177
its own vibrations.

00:24:40.297 --> 00:24:42.978
Now if it finds a stone, it doesn’t go and quarrel.

00:24:43.098 --> 00:24:46.202
So don’t fight with the people who are stonies.

00:24:46.322 --> 00:24:47.814
Just don’t argue with them.

00:24:47.934 --> 00:24:50.767
You cannot make them understand. It’s not possible.

00:24:50.887 --> 00:24:54.027
They have to be seekers and soft,

00:24:54.147 --> 00:24:56.943
like the soft clay you can say,

00:24:57.063 --> 00:25:03.425
through which this little cell goes, penetrates.

00:25:03.545 --> 00:25:07.279
Then it finds, supposing, it finds a big stone.

00:25:07.675 --> 00:25:09.887
Then what, it goes round and round and round.

00:25:10.007 --> 00:25:13.307
So gives it a bandhan nicely! And goes down.

00:25:13.427 --> 00:25:16.778
Later on when it becomes a tree, he uses the stone

00:25:16.898 --> 00:25:20.839
for its, you see, for its support.

00:25:20.959 --> 00:25:22.006
So in the same way,

00:25:22.127 --> 00:25:25.148
you can go round and round and round somebody like that.

00:25:25.268 --> 00:25:28.060
But, giving just bandhan without saying anything.

00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:31.334
In your heart. Not saying, arguing with him anything.

00:25:31.454 --> 00:25:34.357
Because you’ll break your head but he will never be alright.

00:25:34.477 --> 00:25:36.649
So best is not to argue with him.

00:25:36.769 --> 00:25:38.756
But just give him bandhan in your heart

00:25:38.876 --> 00:25:41.875
and somehow or another bind it. So that later on,

00:25:41.995 --> 00:25:44.350
you see, he will become Sahaja Yogi,

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:46.025
but will be a big support to us.

00:25:46.145 --> 00:25:48.733
Because it’s just a stone you see. Just now,

00:25:48.853 --> 00:25:52.729
use soft people, people who are easy people,

00:25:52.849 --> 00:25:57.958
people who are seekers, who are not so complicated.

00:25:58.839 --> 00:26:00.878
And, you cannot argue it out.

00:26:00.998 --> 00:26:03.965
Sahaja Yoga cannot be argued out, cannot be explained to.

00:26:04.085 --> 00:26:07.029
Only thing you have to get it. And if they don’t get it,

00:26:07.149 --> 00:26:09.846
you cannot argue it out: “Oh this is this, this is this”.

00:26:09.966 --> 00:26:12.338
Like, one reporter was asking me:

00:26:12.458 --> 00:26:14.759
“why is it I’m not getting realization?”.

00:26:14.879 --> 00:26:17.338
I couldn’t tell him that he was such an egoist.

00:26:17.458 --> 00:26:20.556
I couldn’t tell him that so I said: “maybe this, maybe that”.

00:26:20.676 --> 00:26:22.599
you see, I was avoiding the topic!

00:26:22.719 --> 00:26:24.500
No use telling him you are a big egoist.

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:27.691
How can you get your realization? Because if I tell him like that,

00:26:27.811 --> 00:26:31.548
then he would be, just off! Absolutely. And he would be against

00:26:31.668 --> 00:26:33.211
Sahaja Yoga completely.

00:26:33.331 --> 00:26:37.461
So we have to use also, tactfully, a method by which

00:26:37.581 --> 00:26:41.521
we do not hurt others. But try to be nice and gentle,

00:26:41.641 --> 00:26:43.881
so they like at least your outer appearance

00:26:44.001 --> 00:26:48.783
that they are very gentle people, they
are very good people and all that.

00:26:49.037 --> 00:26:52.726
Now, in Sahaja Yoga also there is a temptation you might have.

00:26:52.846 --> 00:26:55.299
Because you suddenly get lot of money sometimes,

00:26:55.419 --> 00:26:57.270
suddenly get a big position.

00:26:57.390 --> 00:27:06.316
Suddenly, also you might get a very, rare, dynamic gifts.

00:27:06.436 --> 00:27:10.251
Like you can become great artist, you can become a great poet,

00:27:10.371 --> 00:27:13.633
you might be, something might happen to you suddenly.

00:27:13.753 --> 00:27:18.076
You get a public speaking gifts or anything like that.

00:27:18.196 --> 00:27:21.754
But these are all temptations, and one should not fall into it.

00:27:21.874 --> 00:27:24.869
Of course you must use them for Sahaja Yoga, is alright.

00:27:24.989 --> 00:27:26.610
But you should not fall into it

00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:29.241
and start thinking I’m something great. You see.

00:27:29.361 --> 00:27:34.142
If that is done, then there is a big problem because,

00:27:34.991 --> 00:27:40.241
such a thing gets a person completely out of Sahaja Yoga

00:27:40.361 --> 00:27:43.015
and he gets also punished, in a way.

00:27:43.135 --> 00:27:45.057
Maybe he loses his powers.

00:27:45.177 --> 00:27:50.475
So it’s best is, to keep to your Sahaja Yoga meditation.

00:27:50.595 --> 00:27:52.975
Keep to your own understanding.

00:27:53.095 --> 00:27:55.440
Know yourself, that is the best way.

00:27:55.560 --> 00:28:00.255
And not to be diverted by all these temptations.

00:28:00.375 --> 00:28:02.901
But the same can be used for Sahaja Yoga.

00:28:03.021 --> 00:28:06.301
If that is used for Sahaja Yoga, there is nothing wrong.

00:28:06.421 --> 00:28:10.584
Because these gifts are given to you, not to tempt you but,

00:28:10.704 --> 00:28:13.212
for using for Sahaja Yoga.

00:28:13.332 --> 00:28:17.989
For example, she got my photograph with the light on my head.

00:28:18.109 --> 00:28:25.872
That means there is something happen, between her and the light.

00:28:25.992 --> 00:28:29.334
Because how did I get that light upon my head is a problem.

00:28:29.454 --> 00:28:33.894
To be understood, very simply, that the Vishnumaya is the,

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:38.826
is the, Goddess for light. For electricity.

00:28:39.365 --> 00:28:43.117
And if She wants, She can turn it into any angle

00:28:43.237 --> 00:28:47.320
and can put a subtle meaning to her photograph.

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.944
Now people have taken photographs of the clouds

00:28:50.064 --> 00:28:52.373
and they found me there, absolutely there.

00:28:52.493 --> 00:28:55.059
People believe it or not but it is so.

00:28:55.179 --> 00:28:57.387
Two photographs they saw like that.

00:28:57.507 --> 00:29:00.559
And normally we don’t take photographs of the clouds.

00:29:00.679 --> 00:29:02.682
But it showed in such a way that,

00:29:02.802 --> 00:29:09.147
they first saw a very, luminous, cluster of a cloud.

00:29:09.267 --> 00:29:13.137
And then it expanded and started looking like a Ganesha.

00:29:13.257 --> 00:29:15.257
So, their attention was attracted.

00:29:15.377 --> 00:29:21.890
Then, strings of lights started flowing from both the sides.

00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:24.053
And they found two clusters.

00:29:24.173 --> 00:29:26.339
So they took photos of these two clusters

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:29.170
and when they developed it, they found my photographs,

00:29:29.290 --> 00:29:31.265
two photographs of mine were there.

00:29:31.385 --> 00:29:34.846
One was with, even with the nose thing, when I was wearing it,

00:29:34.966 --> 00:29:36.232
means very latest ones!

00:29:36.352 --> 00:29:42.199
And another one where I look more like a, Red Indian face.

00:29:42.319 --> 00:29:45.004
That kind, coming out of the thing. It’s clearly,

00:29:45.124 --> 00:29:48.048
very clearly you can see. So that’s how they have taken it.

00:29:48.168 --> 00:29:52.194
It’s in the Bible, that you will know the Holy Ghost,

00:29:52.314 --> 00:29:57.996
with the forms of the clouds. Its written down.

00:29:58.116 --> 00:29:59.981
So this is how it is verified.

00:30:00.102 --> 00:30:02.707
But how many people are going to believe it? Very few.

00:30:02.827 --> 00:30:05.827
Very few people are going to believe that this is natural.

00:30:05.947 --> 00:30:08.950
They’ll think “oh, it’s all made up and done up and all that”.

00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:12.923
Because even if the nose ring is showing, is too much.

00:30:13.043 --> 00:30:14.955
Now this Vishnumaya works that way.

00:30:15.075 --> 00:30:18.197
There are so many other Deities who work out something

00:30:18.317 --> 00:30:20.780
in a different way. But whatever it is,

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:23.577
they are all for your construction.

00:30:23.697 --> 00:30:27.780
For your building up as a good Sahaja Yogi.

00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:31.754
So the inner movement is very important in Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:31.874 --> 00:30:35.258
I’m very happy to know that you people are gathering here,

00:30:35.378 --> 00:30:38.489
for meditation and you’re listening to my tapes

00:30:38.609 --> 00:30:41.908
and are growing up well, and I was very happy to see

00:30:42.028 --> 00:30:45.704
the way you are growing. And keep your steady growth.

00:30:45.824 --> 00:30:48.595
Then you’ll become great Sahaja Yogis.

00:30:48.715 --> 00:30:53.757
I’m sure one day, New Zealand or Australia,

00:30:53.877 --> 00:31:00.322
may become the leader, of all the world to, follow, spirituality.

00:31:00.442 --> 00:31:04.454
Because, India is, of course, I must say India is spiritually

00:31:04.574 --> 00:31:07.607
very developed but, they are not leaders I think.

00:31:07.727 --> 00:31:11.437
So far, I have not seen much leaders coming out of India.

00:31:11.557 --> 00:31:14.296
But, once the leaders start coming out of India,

00:31:14.416 --> 00:31:16.824
we can say the, then the second position

00:31:16.944 --> 00:31:20.628
should be given to Australia and New Zealand.

00:31:20.748 --> 00:31:24.631
There will be great people coming out of Australia and New Zealand.

00:31:24.751 --> 00:31:31.720
No doubt about it. Because the, the root part maybe in India.

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:34.620
The foundation part maybe from India,

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:37.798
but the tree part, will be from the west.

00:31:37.918 --> 00:31:39.747
And that is how the east and west

00:31:39.867 --> 00:31:43.272
is going to complete the tree of Sahaja Yoga,

00:31:43.392 --> 00:31:46.101
blossoming and giving fruits.

00:31:46.221 --> 00:31:48.054
May God bless you all.
