00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.418
[A little child calls loudly:
“Mataji! Jai!”.]

00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:22.756
Today's puja we have arranged of Durga
or the Kali.

00:00:23.129 --> 00:00:32.104
That is the destroying form of the Goddess
of all the evil and negativity.

00:00:32.305 --> 00:00:36.522
This we had to do it in France,

00:00:36.723 --> 00:00:44.931
because I feel very strongly that day
by day, in general,

00:00:45.132 --> 00:00:49.988
France is going down and down and down.

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:52.476
While you people are coming up,

00:00:52.677 --> 00:00:57.839
the rest of the France is in the most
pitiable condition.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.981
Firstly, as you understand, is the Catholic
church,

00:01:04.182 --> 00:01:09.367
which - perhaps you are not aware of,
perhaps maybe -

00:01:09.568 --> 00:01:14.857
because you don't read any other languages,

00:01:15.058 --> 00:01:20.807
you just read French compulsorily
by this country.

00:01:21.008 --> 00:01:28.299
So you have no international views
or international news

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:36.832
that this Catholic church has done
so many horrible things in the past,

00:01:37.033 --> 00:01:42.762
that is unbelievable that they have
anything to do with God.

00:01:42.963 --> 00:01:52.995
They burnt many cardinals in the hearth -
roasted them.

00:01:55.885 --> 00:01:59.913
Not only that, they killed so many people

00:02:00.114 --> 00:02:04.063
who ever tried to utter a word about them.

00:02:04.264 --> 00:02:08.923
They were much worse than Muslim people.

00:02:09.216 --> 00:02:14.079
They went to other countries like South
America, America -

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:21.644
all these places they're all Catholics -
even our country.

00:02:21.858 --> 00:02:29.850
And they killed millions and millions
of people.

00:02:33.074 --> 00:02:37.516
Now as this is Kruta Yuga that has started,

00:02:37.717 --> 00:02:40.863
one of the things as I said yesterday
is that:

00:02:41.064 --> 00:02:45.438
you will have to pay for whatever you
have done,

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:50.039
on mass scale or individual scale.

00:02:52.611 --> 00:02:55.797
If that is the case,

00:02:55.998 --> 00:03:00.183
then one must know that France has to pay
a lot

00:03:00.384 --> 00:03:05.897
and this Catholic church has to pay more.

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:11.567
Catholic church has just taken out yarns
out of their heads

00:03:11.768 --> 00:03:16.766
and started a theory of original sin.

00:03:16.967 --> 00:03:22.040
That's how to condemn every other
Incarnation, every other Prophet -

00:03:22.241 --> 00:03:24.749
that they were all with original sin.

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.982
And even they said Mary was born with
original sin,

00:03:28.183 --> 00:03:32.530
for many popes they were discussing it.

00:03:34.364 --> 00:03:40.401
This shows that this whole hocus-pocus
religion of Catholic church

00:03:40.602 --> 00:03:47.359
had to establish itself by forcing people,
by torturing them,

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:54.887
by taking all their ideas into their
own control,

00:03:55.088 --> 00:04:00.324
give them funny ideas like original sin.

00:04:00.525 --> 00:04:07.701
Another is that you must confess, giving
them the left Vishuddhis.

00:04:07.923 --> 00:04:13.228
They treated women as nothing

00:04:13.429 --> 00:04:17.561
and to Mother of Mary they called Her
a woman.

00:04:17.762 --> 00:04:21.414
And this Paul, as I told you yesterday,
is a fact.

00:04:21.628 --> 00:04:25.647
Now it's necessary for Sahaja Yogis
to understand

00:04:25.848 --> 00:04:34.705
how this Catholic church is so dangerous
and has been doing such harm.

00:04:34.906 --> 00:04:39.550
As there has been so many books about it -

00:04:39.751 --> 00:04:45.413
that you people don't read, because
it's not in French.

00:04:45.906 --> 00:04:51.903
There are English books from America -
you must learn English.

00:04:52.104 --> 00:04:55.962
It's very important now I feel, that
all the French must know English,

00:04:56.163 --> 00:04:59.046
they must read English.

00:04:59.247 --> 00:05:04.187
French will not give you the international
personality

00:05:04.388 --> 00:05:08.224
that you are supposed to acquire.

00:05:08.438 --> 00:05:12.126
You had some scholarship, not much.

00:05:12.327 --> 00:05:15.661
The real scholarship comes from England

00:05:15.862 --> 00:05:23.614
and also from America in English language,
and also from India.

00:05:23.815 --> 00:05:29.150
One gentleman who tried to translate
all these things in UNESCO,

00:05:29.351 --> 00:05:32.806
he was thrown out by your media.

00:05:33.013 --> 00:05:37.987
Your media is taking full advantage that
you don't read any other newspapers;

00:05:38.188 --> 00:05:41.546
they are doing whatever they feel like.

00:05:41.747 --> 00:05:49.187
All kinds of scandals, all kinds
of sensationalization -

00:05:49.388 --> 00:05:53.325
whatever they want to write, they write
in free press.

00:05:53.526 --> 00:05:58.809
On one side there's suppression of natural
life of human beings,

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.184
let them to go to Freud.

00:06:02.385 --> 00:06:05.887
When Freud is the dirtiest man you
could think of,

00:06:06.088 --> 00:06:09.255
who has put his ideas into your head.

00:06:09.456 --> 00:06:16.210
But as if you are already brainwashed
people that you accepted all that.

00:06:16.411 --> 00:06:20.450
How could you accept Freud? If Freud
had come to India,

00:06:20.651 --> 00:06:23.556
they would have killed him in no time!

00:06:23.757 --> 00:06:27.643
What happens is that, somehow or other -
I don't know what is the reason,

00:06:27.844 --> 00:06:32.248
I don't know where to place it, but
the wisdom is not there.

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:36.054
There is no maturity, there is no wisdom.

00:06:36.255 --> 00:06:40.871
America I can understand because it is only
two-three hundred years old.

00:06:41.072 --> 00:06:45.094
But what about the French? They have
not been able

00:06:45.295 --> 00:06:50.139
to mature but they have become extremely
frivolous.

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.642
Maturity is finished.

00:06:53.843 --> 00:07:00.594
One of the reasons could be that they want
that you should be always young.

00:07:00.795 --> 00:07:07.167
In India, young people are called
as stupid:

00:07:08.271 --> 00:07:13.736
you call it gadha pachisi, means
at twenty-five years they are donkeys.

00:07:13.937 --> 00:07:19.784
They are never regarded as sensible people
to be followed.

00:07:20.379 --> 00:07:27.612
And gradually by this movement from
Catholic church to Freud,

00:07:27.816 --> 00:07:31.540
what has happened that you haven't got
your own personality

00:07:31.741 --> 00:07:36.334
to understand what is right and what is
wrong.

00:07:36.535 --> 00:07:39.923
Of course, I must say Sahaja Yogis must
have done lots of punyas

00:07:40.124 --> 00:07:45.586
and must be very courageous people to be
born in this country.

00:07:45.787 --> 00:07:49.726
Otherwise I don't know how you could have
taken your birth here.

00:07:49.927 --> 00:07:58.490
The law is so funny that they said it
depends on the mood of the magistrate,

00:07:58.691 --> 00:08:05.419
As if, you see, the magistrate doesn't
know the law.

00:08:06.015 --> 00:08:10.402
Such a stupid country in modern times
I've never known.

00:08:10.603 --> 00:08:14.072
Nowhere in the world there's such a stupid
law as it is here.

00:08:14.273 --> 00:08:18.330
Of course, in America, there is no justice,
they do what they like.

00:08:18.531 --> 00:08:24.009
But here is so-called modern people.

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:28.418
What is their condition is that they have
no sense of law.

00:08:28.619 --> 00:08:31.096
If you ask them, "What is the law?"
They don't care.

00:08:31.297 --> 00:08:33.937
It's the mood of the magistrate.

00:08:34.138 --> 00:08:38.342
Now supposing he has had a big drink
in the last night,

00:08:38.543 --> 00:08:42.957
second day he comes with a hangover,
so finished.

00:08:43.158 --> 00:08:50.213
And then he will be very much biased
towards the drunkards only.

00:08:50.859 --> 00:08:58.498
So, here it is becoming such a horrible
society

00:08:58.699 --> 00:09:05.825
that Indians would be shocked, beyond
doubt, but nothing but prostitution.

00:09:11.006 --> 00:09:15.050
To see and to be seen.

00:09:15.791 --> 00:09:17.604
Why?

00:09:17.805 --> 00:09:20.585
Every woman has to dress up in such a way

00:09:20.786 --> 00:09:27.468
that she should be attractive, for what?
Is she a prostitute?

00:09:30.014 --> 00:09:36.647
All kinds of bathroom cultures developed.

00:09:36.848 --> 00:09:42.992
For example French bath, you know what
it means, all over the world.

00:09:43.193 --> 00:09:49.552
It's a very dirty habit of laziness,
it comes because of drinking.

00:09:49.753 --> 00:09:53.382
If you drink too much, next morning you
are so lethargic

00:09:53.583 --> 00:09:57.972
that you take just a French bath and
go away.

00:09:58.173 --> 00:10:00.676
So, please try to remember as French
Sahaja Yogis,

00:10:00.877 --> 00:10:06.386
that your task is much more difficult
than the task of other countries,

00:10:06.587 --> 00:10:14.708
because it lacks completely wisdom.

00:10:15.278 --> 00:10:20.586
Neither you'll find in your institutions,
nor in your government,

00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:28.420
nor in any education.

00:10:28.955 --> 00:10:33.856
It's lacking wisdom completely.

00:10:35.455 --> 00:10:39.194
And to have wisdom, according to these
Freudian people,

00:10:39.395 --> 00:10:43.462
is that you are egoistical!

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:51.294
They have such funny ideas from the yarn
of Mr. Freud

00:10:51.495 --> 00:10:56.469
that no sensible man would accept.

00:10:57.675 --> 00:11:03.396
But people have lost their senses,
and like blotting paper,

00:11:03.597 --> 00:11:13.760
whatever is filthy, destructive, horrible,
subhuman, they try to absorb.

00:11:14.746 --> 00:11:18.936
Supposed to be Christian nation.

00:11:22.584 --> 00:11:26.974
Please, all Sahaja Yogis must understand:

00:11:27.175 --> 00:11:33.250
you must get hold of books and find out,
where are we?

00:11:33.451 --> 00:11:37.803
I worked very hard in France, you know
that very well.

00:11:38.004 --> 00:11:41.054
I used to think, this is the gate of hell.

00:11:41.255 --> 00:11:45.018
But it is much worse than that,

00:11:45.219 --> 00:11:50.290
it's a mire of filth. And you are born here

00:11:50.491 --> 00:11:56.848
and you have become like lotuses,
so fragrant and beautiful,

00:11:57.049 --> 00:11:59.805
you'll have to fight it out.

00:12:00.006 --> 00:12:02.945
I am always with you, all My powers
with you.

00:12:03.146 --> 00:12:06.320
But remember that you have to fight
the society,

00:12:06.521 --> 00:12:12.065
you have to save so many people, you have
to rescue them.

00:12:13.803 --> 00:12:16.758
Children are given liberty, "Do what
you like."

00:12:16.959 --> 00:12:20.012
They have no sense of liberty!

00:12:20.213 --> 00:12:22.662
Supposing there's an aeroplane,

00:12:22.863 --> 00:12:25.665
which was not fixed properly and made
to fly.

00:12:25.866 --> 00:12:29.152
What will happen to the aeroplane?

00:12:29.353 --> 00:12:35.654
If the children are given liberty without
the right sense of their duty

00:12:35.855 --> 00:12:40.596
and the right sense about themselves,
what will happen to them?

00:12:40.797 --> 00:12:47.954
Why children are born to parents?
It is to get spoiled,

00:12:48.155 --> 00:12:53.466
to have liberty or to get some guidance?

00:12:53.849 --> 00:12:57.371
You cannot guide your children.

00:12:57.572 --> 00:13:03.141
They are so rude, they are so arrogant.

00:13:03.342 --> 00:13:09.197
They have gone off, completely.

00:13:09.398 --> 00:13:13.110
You know for one month we had to struggle
with these western children.

00:13:13.333 --> 00:13:16.539
And we had come to the point of urge
of closing down that school

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:20.849
because they were really violent children,

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:24.050
as if coming from some jungle.

00:13:24.257 --> 00:13:28.308
Even the jungle animals have some sense.

00:13:29.244 --> 00:13:32.974
So you have to think about your children.

00:13:33.175 --> 00:13:36.531
What's going to happen to your children?

00:13:36.732 --> 00:13:40.622
What is going to be their situation?

00:13:40.995 --> 00:13:46.938
If they are going to live in the same
manner in this dirt,

00:13:47.139 --> 00:13:54.413
these children will turn out to be waste,
just a waste!

00:13:54.614 --> 00:14:00.517
They will have no education, no character,
no personality,

00:14:00.718 --> 00:14:10.457
they'll end up with AIDS or with drugs
or something like that.

00:14:10.658 --> 00:14:16.829
I do not see any future for the children
of France, no future.

00:14:20.012 --> 00:14:25.417
And you have to fight that, "We want
to have future for our children,

00:14:25.618 --> 00:14:28.277
we don't want them to be ruined."

00:14:28.478 --> 00:14:32.494
And you must have courage to fight it.

00:14:32.695 --> 00:14:37.005
It's very important to have courage.

00:14:37.206 --> 00:14:42.297
If you do not have the courage, you cannot
fight it.

00:14:42.498 --> 00:14:48.564
And today's puja is to give that courage
in your hearts.

00:14:48.765 --> 00:14:54.644
See it all around you, what's happening?

00:14:54.845 --> 00:14:58.567
You are all nicely enjoying yourself
in the realm of God,

00:14:58.768 --> 00:15:00.666
you have entered into the Kingdom of God.

00:15:00.867 --> 00:15:05.148
But what about the rest of the people?

00:15:05.366 --> 00:15:10.277
The majority of the people, where are they
going?

00:15:13.663 --> 00:15:27.590
What is going to be the future of this
horrible Mooladhara place?

00:15:29.344 --> 00:15:34.953
Now Freud has been discovered
as a fraudulent man,

00:15:35.154 --> 00:15:38.067
and now there are books after so many
years,

00:15:38.268 --> 00:15:42.247
when he has already ruined the people
all over the world.

00:15:42.448 --> 00:15:46.928
But the worst of all, they have ruined
here.

00:15:51.068 --> 00:15:53.791
It's a responsibility specially
of the women I think,

00:15:53.992 --> 00:15:57.837
because they are responsible for
the society.

00:15:58.038 --> 00:16:03.414
The society of France has gone to dogs

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:10.030
and for you to now take up upon yourself

00:16:10.231 --> 00:16:16.664
to talk against this kind of anarchy

00:16:16.865 --> 00:16:22.275
that is working out the destruction
of your families.

00:16:24.018 --> 00:16:32.572
If the women decide, I am sure, they
can very, very easily work it out.

00:16:32.773 --> 00:16:37.842
Instead of asking for liberation
nonsensical,

00:16:38.418 --> 00:16:43.067
you better ask for the ascent of this
country.

00:16:43.268 --> 00:16:46.429
I know, I've worked very hard and you are
all there.

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:49.422
I am very happy to see that you all
are there

00:16:49.623 --> 00:17:01.277
to fulfill the desires of the Divine.

00:17:01.478 --> 00:17:07.203
Because now you should know in a very
big way,

00:17:07.404 --> 00:17:13.235
masses of masses of people will be
destroyed.

00:17:17.014 --> 00:17:21.454
Not from without but from within.

00:17:23.188 --> 00:17:29.138
Suddenly you'll hear so many millions
disappear with this disease.

00:17:32.992 --> 00:17:38.099
Also you must protect yourself, all of you:

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:45.817
always give yourself a bandhan; always
lead a clean life.

00:17:46.018 --> 00:17:52.244
There are certain hygienic rules of Sahaja
Yoga, please try to follow them.

00:17:52.445 --> 00:17:55.617
Do not neglect it.

00:17:55.818 --> 00:17:59.837
If somebody gets AIDS, you'll not have him
in Sahaja Yoga,

00:18:00.038 --> 00:18:04.487
whatever may be the conditions, whatever
may be the reason.

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:11.980
You have to be very careful, also I would
say never treat a AIDS patient.

00:18:12.181 --> 00:18:14.766
Like the one yesterday who was arguing
with Me,

00:18:14.967 --> 00:18:19.083
actually because they have only two types
of people:

00:18:19.284 --> 00:18:26.310
one who are arrogant and another one
which always

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:33.322
think that it's better they should die.
They have no will to live.

00:18:33.523 --> 00:18:38.041
So there are only two types of people,
either right-sided or left-sided.

00:18:38.242 --> 00:18:42.798
And they can never ascend. We have tried,
we have tried.

00:18:42.999 --> 00:18:46.108
Of course, one person is living
for the last seven years,

00:18:46.346 --> 00:18:51.753
but still he has no faith in himself.

00:18:51.954 --> 00:18:57.259
Maybe next generation might be better on,
if they come back.

00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:01.628
But as far as this generation is concerned,

00:19:01.829 --> 00:19:06.584
you should know your responsibility
is very great.

00:19:06.785 --> 00:19:11.528
All the Sahaja Yogis must take a vow

00:19:11.729 --> 00:19:16.565
that they'll fight this society and try
to save their country

00:19:16.766 --> 00:19:22.331
and their countrymen from a complete
disaster.

00:19:22.532 --> 00:19:25.900
There is going to be no war,

00:19:26.101 --> 00:19:31.168
only they will fight themselves and die.

00:19:33.144 --> 00:19:35.425
It's a very serious matter.

00:19:35.626 --> 00:19:41.002
For that, we decided to have this puja
of Durga today

00:19:41.203 --> 00:19:45.471
that all negativity should be destroyed.

00:19:45.672 --> 00:19:52.678
So many Deities build up the body of Kali.

00:19:52.879 --> 00:19:58.395
Every part of Her body was created
by a Deity, looked after by a Deity,

00:19:58.596 --> 00:20:06.380
and is also, later on, is reflected
in you all.

00:20:08.574 --> 00:20:12.648
So they say that God has made human beings
in His own image,

00:20:12.849 --> 00:20:16.470
I would say, I've made you in My own
image,

00:20:16.671 --> 00:20:21.584
all the Deities at your disposal.

00:20:21.785 --> 00:20:26.082
They're all with you, and they have created
you - if you see it minutely -

00:20:26.283 --> 00:20:31.572
it is the Deities who have brought forth
all the beauty that you had.

00:20:31.773 --> 00:20:41.371
They have made all this beautiful
congregation, beautiful transformation,

00:20:41.572 --> 00:20:49.227
and they have created such angelic people
out of you.

00:20:49.903 --> 00:20:52.499
They are always working it out,

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:58.173
but one thing you have to do is to have
the drive.

00:20:58.374 --> 00:21:03.525
You had pure desire to ascend, but
for what?

00:21:03.726 --> 00:21:08.157
You want to have the light, but for what?

00:21:08.358 --> 00:21:12.304
You want to become gurus, for what?

00:21:12.505 --> 00:21:17.098
To save people, for their salvation.

00:21:17.328 --> 00:21:20.742
Only through your channels I can work out
Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:20.943 --> 00:21:24.174
If I could work out Myself, I would have.

00:21:24.375 --> 00:21:28.932
It's not question of killing one rakshasa.

00:21:29.133 --> 00:21:34.048
God knows how many there are, rakshasas
and rakshasas.

00:21:34.249 --> 00:21:40.255
And they are everywhere, even within you
they were.

00:21:40.456 --> 00:21:43.952
Now they have gone away.

00:21:47.296 --> 00:21:53.086
So you have to do full justice to Sahaja
Yoga, that's very important.

00:21:53.287 --> 00:21:56.281
I knew the puja would be very late,
because Kali's puja

00:21:56.482 --> 00:22:02.845
is always done in the night, after twelve.
So it had to be this way.

00:22:03.046 --> 00:22:05.480
Though last night I slept at four o'clock
and I,  tonight,

00:22:05.681 --> 00:22:12.676
I don't know what time I will sleep -
it all works out. It's all worked out.

00:22:12.877 --> 00:22:15.927
But you have to have deliberations
and you have to think,

00:22:16.128 --> 00:22:18.740
“What can we do to change this?”

00:22:18.941 --> 00:22:25.731
Why not write some books, why not write
some experiences?

00:22:25.932 --> 00:22:31.450
Get them published in French only. Let
the French know what’s happening outside.

00:22:31.651 --> 00:22:35.803
Get some of the books translated –

00:22:37.165 --> 00:22:43.419
some American books, some English books.
At least give quotations from there.

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:47.774
How they are unaware. First this Catholic
church has to go away.

00:22:47.975 --> 00:22:54.207
It will, no doubt, I am sure about it.
They are literally frightened of us.

00:23:00.122 --> 00:23:06.759
And we have to now really show them
what we are capable of.

00:23:08.791 --> 00:23:16.563
And the funniest thing is that a president
has chosen

00:23:16.764 --> 00:23:19.131
his lady-friend as the prime minister.

00:23:19.332 --> 00:23:26.326
I mean, it’s not possible in any sensible
country. It’s never heard of.

00:23:26.527 --> 00:23:31.668
I must say, English are thousand times
better.

00:23:32.556 --> 00:23:34.994
They are really very good.

00:23:35.195 --> 00:23:39.054
At least, as far as administration
is concerned,

00:23:39.255 --> 00:23:43.217
as far as their parliament is concerned.
Their justice is not stupid like this,

00:23:43.418 --> 00:23:48.352
it’s based on law, not based on the mood
of a magistrate.

00:23:48.553 --> 00:23:51.855
How you are still continuing with such
stupidity

00:23:52.056 --> 00:23:56.772
which are really even before medieval age:

00:23:56.973 --> 00:24:02.876
primitive, people are absolutely primitive
to accept such laws.

00:24:03.077 --> 00:24:10.996
At least you can write a book about
the strange laws of French, one title.

00:24:15.206 --> 00:24:18.837
How it has harmed. There is a very nice
book, “Fraudulent Freud”.

00:24:19.038 --> 00:24:23.420
Please read that, and see how Freud
has ruined the French,

00:24:23.621 --> 00:24:27.054
how their brains are twisted, how they
have twisted ideas.

00:24:27.255 --> 00:24:31.453
You are all so intelligent, clever people.

00:24:33.826 --> 00:24:41.189
So if not with the sword, Kali has to work
through the pen.

00:24:48.114 --> 00:24:54.210
I never knew it was in that bad shape,
though I knew it was.

00:24:55.671 --> 00:25:00.836
So this is a challenge for all of us,

00:25:01.037 --> 00:25:08.117
and let Me see what you can write, all
of you, put together your experiences:

00:25:08.318 --> 00:25:11.648
how the French parents behave, how
the grandparents behave,

00:25:11.849 --> 00:25:16.089
what’s happening in this country and
all that.

00:25:21.391 --> 00:25:25.584
They are living in fool’s paradise.

00:25:27.702 --> 00:25:35.942
They don’t know how destruction is just
hanging over their heads.

00:25:39.755 --> 00:25:44.976
Though you are all saved, but you have
to think of others,

00:25:45.177 --> 00:25:52.662
that is what Sahaja Yoga is, that is not
only that we care for the bhaktas –

00:25:52.863 --> 00:26:01.302
like Kali just wanted to protect
the bhaktas, the sadhakas.

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:11.034
But you have to protect many, many more
people.

00:26:11.235 --> 00:26:17.973
You have all the powers, just assume them
and use them.

00:26:19.775 --> 00:26:22.729
You can do it.

00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:26.289
Your media is the worst of all

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:30.781
and we can start a newspaper also calling
it anti-media.

00:26:30.982 --> 00:26:34.205
What can they do to us?

00:26:34.406 --> 00:26:39.603
Or some sort of an independent name,
we can give it.

00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:43.724
And it should be open for people who
are suffering

00:26:43.925 --> 00:26:50.363
from media sensationalization.
They can write:

00:26:50.564 --> 00:26:54.358
how the media is harming them, how they
are giving false reports and things.

00:26:54.559 --> 00:26:57.685
We can! Why not?

00:27:00.757 --> 00:27:03.986
I am sure it will work out.

00:27:05.567 --> 00:27:10.571
Think it over what you can do with
your pen.

00:27:14.303 --> 00:27:18.680
Whatever you have gained, whatever you
are enjoying: beautiful music,

00:27:18.881 --> 00:27:22.377
all the pujas, everything. But think
of others.

00:27:22.578 --> 00:27:29.071
They are already drunk and tossing
their heads on their pillows.

00:27:29.272 --> 00:27:35.406
Think of them. They, when will they feel
this joy?

00:27:35.625 --> 00:27:38.250
I simply feel pity for them

00:27:38.451 --> 00:27:42.809
that they should have taken to all these
bad things,

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:45.011
because of the suppression of the Catholic
church.

00:27:45.212 --> 00:27:47.419
It’s the Catholic church which has
suppressed them,

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:50.781
that’s why they have come to this.
No other way –

00:27:50.982 --> 00:27:55.420
reason why they should accept this kind
of thing.

00:27:59.709 --> 00:28:04.436
In Sahaja Yoga, we do not do all these
things, we are in the centre.

00:28:04.637 --> 00:28:08.658
We do not have this kind of problems,
because we don’t suppress anyone,

00:28:08.859 --> 00:28:12.983
nor do we go to the other extreme
of indulgences.

00:28:13.184 --> 00:28:16.633
I think the whole Europe can be divided
into two types of people:

00:28:16.834 --> 00:28:21.000
one are Anglo-Saxons, and others are
Latins.

00:28:21.201 --> 00:28:26.094
Anglo-Saxons are right-sided and the Latins
are left-sided:

00:28:26.295 --> 00:28:33.691
they cry, weep, miserable, they indulge
into dirt and filth.

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:37.389
Just these two types they are.

00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:43.249
Now, unluckily you are in the Latin side.

00:28:44.007 --> 00:28:50.358
So here, Catholic church is prospering.

00:28:50.993 --> 00:28:56.444
Now, if you see to the Latin side and
understand

00:28:56.645 --> 00:29:00.026
to what extent they have gone to the left
side,

00:29:00.227 --> 00:29:05.318
and getting to the left side what diseases
you get, very nicely,

00:29:05.519 --> 00:29:08.812
make a list of them.

00:29:09.013 --> 00:29:13.485
So what I said will work out in France:

00:29:13.686 --> 00:29:17.504
the left-sided incurable diseases.

00:29:17.705 --> 00:29:21.279
As it is, you walk on the street, you find
at least three, four

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:26.711
mad people, lunatic people walking,
you’ll find them.

00:29:27.514 --> 00:29:32.259
Very simple it is. You don’t have to go
to the lunatic asylum, on the street!

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:38.129
They’ll be all talking and saying things,
but it’s all there.

00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:41.767
“That’s why they drink, that’s why they
are miserable.”.

00:29:41.967 --> 00:29:47.528
I do not know what are the statistics
of the diseases.

00:29:51.936 --> 00:29:56.773
So the problem is extremely grave,
very grave.

00:29:56.974 --> 00:30:00.291
And you have to work it out,

00:30:00.492 --> 00:30:05.407
with the gravity of your Gurupada which
you have asked Me the other day –

00:30:05.608 --> 00:30:11.354
you asked for the status of a guru,
for ladies as well as for men.

00:30:11.555 --> 00:30:16.110
And I said, “All right, start!”

00:30:17.403 --> 00:30:22.670
I hope you all have heard the song
I’ve made, for asking.

00:30:22.871 --> 00:30:25.301
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Marathi]

00:30:25.502 --> 00:30:27.085
All right, once they will sing that song.

00:30:27.286 --> 00:30:29.582
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Marathi]
All right.

00:30:29.783 --> 00:30:40.195
They will sing that song to you. There are
different requests from the Mother,

00:30:40.396 --> 00:30:44.559
and in this the last one is that: “Mother,
now you give us

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:48.920
the Gurupada, the status of a guru.”

00:30:49.121 --> 00:30:54.669
But every guru has a duty: to cleanse
the society in which he lives.

00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:57.930
It’s his duty, he has to fight it.

00:30:58.131 --> 00:31:02.682
Christ fought it alone, so many saints
fought it alone,

00:31:02.883 --> 00:31:07.980
they were treated very badly, put in jail,
given poisons, things, but they fought it.

00:31:08.181 --> 00:31:13.281
In the same way you stand on Truth,
and you have to fight it.

00:31:15.539 --> 00:31:18.914
Because you are saints.

00:31:22.446 --> 00:31:24.812
May God bless you.
