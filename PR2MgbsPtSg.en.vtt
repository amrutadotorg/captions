WEBVTT

00:02.640 --> 00:06.418
[A little child calls loudly:
“Mataji! Jai!”.]

00:13.933 --> 00:22.756
Today's puja we have arranged of Durga
or the Kali.

00:23.129 --> 00:32.104
That is the destroying form of the Goddess
of all the evil and negativity.

00:32.305 --> 00:36.522
This we had to do it in France,

00:36.723 --> 00:44.931
because I feel very strongly that day
by day, in general,

00:45.132 --> 00:49.988
France is going down and down and down.

00:50.189 --> 00:52.476
While you people are coming up,

00:52.677 --> 00:57.839
the rest of the France is in the most
pitiable condition.

00:58.040 --> 01:03.981
Firstly, as you understand, is the Catholic
church,

01:04.182 --> 01:09.367
which - perhaps you are not aware of,
perhaps maybe -

01:09.568 --> 01:14.857
because you don't read any other languages,

01:15.058 --> 01:20.807
you just read French compulsorily
by this country.

01:21.008 --> 01:28.299
So you have no international views
or international news

01:28.500 --> 01:36.832
that this Catholic church has done
so many horrible things in the past,

01:37.033 --> 01:42.762
that is unbelievable that they have
anything to do with God.

01:42.963 --> 01:52.995
They burnt many cardinals in the hearth -
roasted them.

01:55.885 --> 01:59.913
Not only that, they killed so many people

02:00.114 --> 02:04.063
who ever tried to utter a word about them.

02:04.264 --> 02:08.923
They were much worse than Muslim people.

02:09.216 --> 02:14.079
They went to other countries like South
America, America -

02:14.280 --> 02:21.644
all these places they're all Catholics -
even our country.

02:21.858 --> 02:29.850
And they killed millions and millions
of people.

02:33.074 --> 02:37.516
Now as this is Kruta Yuga that has started,

02:37.717 --> 02:40.863
one of the things as I said yesterday
is that:

02:41.064 --> 02:45.438
you will have to pay for whatever you
have done,

02:45.639 --> 02:50.039
on mass scale or individual scale.

02:52.611 --> 02:55.797
If that is the case,

02:55.998 --> 03:00.183
then one must know that France has to pay
a lot

03:00.384 --> 03:05.897
and this Catholic church has to pay more.

03:06.969 --> 03:11.567
Catholic church has just taken out yarns
out of their heads

03:11.768 --> 03:16.766
and started a theory of original sin.

03:16.967 --> 03:22.040
That's how to condemn every other
Incarnation, every other Prophet -

03:22.241 --> 03:24.749
that they were all with original sin.

03:24.950 --> 03:27.982
And even they said Mary was born with
original sin,

03:28.183 --> 03:32.530
for many popes they were discussing it.

03:34.364 --> 03:40.401
This shows that this whole hocus-pocus
religion of Catholic church

03:40.602 --> 03:47.359
had to establish itself by forcing people,
by torturing them,

03:47.560 --> 03:54.887
by taking all their ideas into their
own control,

03:55.088 --> 04:00.324
give them funny ideas like original sin.

04:00.525 --> 04:07.701
Another is that you must confess, giving
them the left Vishuddhis.

04:07.923 --> 04:13.228
They treated women as nothing

04:13.429 --> 04:17.561
and to Mother of Mary they called Her
a woman.

04:17.762 --> 04:21.414
And this Paul, as I told you yesterday,
is a fact.

04:21.628 --> 04:25.647
Now it's necessary for Sahaja Yogis
to understand

04:25.848 --> 04:34.705
how this Catholic church is so dangerous
and has been doing such harm.

04:34.906 --> 04:39.550
As there has been so many books about it -

04:39.751 --> 04:45.413
that you people don't read, because
it's not in French.

04:45.906 --> 04:51.903
There are English books from America -
you must learn English.

04:52.104 --> 04:55.962
It's very important now I feel, that
all the French must know English,

04:56.163 --> 04:59.046
they must read English.

04:59.247 --> 05:04.187
French will not give you the international
personality

05:04.388 --> 05:08.224
that you are supposed to acquire.

05:08.438 --> 05:12.126
You had some scholarship, not much.

05:12.327 --> 05:15.661
The real scholarship comes from England

05:15.862 --> 05:23.614
and also from America in English language,
and also from India.

05:23.815 --> 05:29.150
One gentleman who tried to translate
all these things in UNESCO,

05:29.351 --> 05:32.806
he was thrown out by your media.

05:33.013 --> 05:37.987
Your media is taking full advantage that
you don't read any other newspapers;

05:38.188 --> 05:41.546
they are doing whatever they feel like.

05:41.747 --> 05:49.187
All kinds of scandals, all kinds
of sensationalization -

05:49.388 --> 05:53.325
whatever they want to write, they write
in free press.

05:53.526 --> 05:58.809
On one side there's suppression of natural
life of human beings,

05:59.010 --> 06:02.184
let them to go to Freud.

06:02.385 --> 06:05.887
When Freud is the dirtiest man you
could think of,

06:06.088 --> 06:09.255
who has put his ideas into your head.

06:09.456 --> 06:16.210
But as if you are already brainwashed
people that you accepted all that.

06:16.411 --> 06:20.450
How could you accept Freud? If Freud
had come to India,

06:20.651 --> 06:23.556
they would have killed him in no time!

06:23.757 --> 06:27.643
What happens is that, somehow or other -
I don't know what is the reason,

06:27.844 --> 06:32.248
I don't know where to place it, but
the wisdom is not there.

06:32.449 --> 06:36.054
There is no maturity, there is no wisdom.

06:36.255 --> 06:40.871
America I can understand because it is only
two-three hundred years old.

06:41.072 --> 06:45.094
But what about the French? They have
not been able

06:45.295 --> 06:50.139
to mature but they have become extremely
frivolous.

06:50.340 --> 06:53.642
Maturity is finished.

06:53.843 --> 07:00.594
One of the reasons could be that they want
that you should be always young.

07:00.795 --> 07:07.167
In India, young people are called
as stupid:

07:08.271 --> 07:13.736
you call it gadha pachisi, means
at twenty-five years they are donkeys.

07:13.937 --> 07:19.784
They are never regarded as sensible people
to be followed.

07:20.379 --> 07:27.612
And gradually by this movement from
Catholic church to Freud,

07:27.816 --> 07:31.540
what has happened that you haven't got
your own personality

07:31.741 --> 07:36.334
to understand what is right and what is
wrong.

07:36.535 --> 07:39.923
Of course, I must say Sahaja Yogis must
have done lots of punyas

07:40.124 --> 07:45.586
and must be very courageous people to be
born in this country.

07:45.787 --> 07:49.726
Otherwise I don't know how you could have
taken your birth here.

07:49.927 --> 07:58.490
The law is so funny that they said it
depends on the mood of the magistrate,

07:58.691 --> 08:05.419
As if, you see, the magistrate doesn't
know the law.

08:06.015 --> 08:10.402
Such a stupid country in modern times
I've never known.

08:10.603 --> 08:14.072
Nowhere in the world there's such a stupid
law as it is here.

08:14.273 --> 08:18.330
Of course, in America, there is no justice,
they do what they like.

08:18.531 --> 08:24.009
But here is so-called modern people.

08:24.210 --> 08:28.418
What is their condition is that they have
no sense of law.

08:28.619 --> 08:31.096
If you ask them, "What is the law?"
They don't care.

08:31.297 --> 08:33.937
It's the mood of the magistrate.

08:34.138 --> 08:38.342
Now supposing he has had a big drink
in the last night,

08:38.543 --> 08:42.957
second day he comes with a hangover,
so finished.

08:43.158 --> 08:50.213
And then he will be very much biased
towards the drunkards only.

08:50.859 --> 08:58.498
So, here it is becoming such a horrible
society

08:58.699 --> 09:05.825
that Indians would be shocked, beyond
doubt, but nothing but prostitution.

09:11.006 --> 09:15.050
To see and to be seen.

09:15.791 --> 09:17.604
Why?

09:17.805 --> 09:20.585
Every woman has to dress up in such a way

09:20.786 --> 09:27.468
that she should be attractive, for what?
Is she a prostitute?

09:30.014 --> 09:36.647
All kinds of bathroom cultures developed.

09:36.848 --> 09:42.992
For example French bath, you know what
it means, all over the world.

09:43.193 --> 09:49.552
It's a very dirty habit of laziness,
it comes because of drinking.

09:49.753 --> 09:53.382
If you drink too much, next morning you
are so lethargic

09:53.583 --> 09:57.972
that you take just a French bath and
go away.

09:58.173 --> 10:00.676
So, please try to remember as French
Sahaja Yogis,

10:00.877 --> 10:06.386
that your task is much more difficult
than the task of other countries,

10:06.587 --> 10:14.708
because it lacks completely wisdom.

10:15.278 --> 10:20.586
Neither you'll find in your institutions,
nor in your government,

10:20.787 --> 10:28.420
nor in any education.

10:28.955 --> 10:33.856
It's lacking wisdom completely.

10:35.455 --> 10:39.194
And to have wisdom, according to these
Freudian people,

10:39.395 --> 10:43.462
is that you are egoistical!

10:46.210 --> 10:51.294
They have such funny ideas from the yarn
of Mr. Freud

10:51.495 --> 10:56.469
that no sensible man would accept.

10:57.675 --> 11:03.396
But people have lost their senses,
and like blotting paper,

11:03.597 --> 11:13.760
whatever is filthy, destructive, horrible,
subhuman, they try to absorb.

11:14.746 --> 11:18.936
Supposed to be Christian nation.

11:22.584 --> 11:26.974
Please, all Sahaja Yogis must understand:

11:27.175 --> 11:33.250
you must get hold of books and find out,
where are we?

11:33.451 --> 11:37.803
I worked very hard in France, you know
that very well.

11:38.004 --> 11:41.054
I used to think, this is the gate of hell.

11:41.255 --> 11:45.018
But it is much worse than that,

11:45.219 --> 11:50.290
it's a mire of filth. And you are born here

11:50.491 --> 11:56.848
and you have become like lotuses,
so fragrant and beautiful,

11:57.049 --> 11:59.805
you'll have to fight it out.

12:00.006 --> 12:02.945
I am always with you, all My powers
with you.

12:03.146 --> 12:06.320
But remember that you have to fight
the society,

12:06.521 --> 12:12.065
you have to save so many people, you have
to rescue them.

12:13.803 --> 12:16.758
Children are given liberty, "Do what
you like."

12:16.959 --> 12:20.012
They have no sense of liberty!

12:20.213 --> 12:22.662
Supposing there's an aeroplane,

12:22.863 --> 12:25.665
which was not fixed properly and made
to fly.

12:25.866 --> 12:29.152
What will happen to the aeroplane?

12:29.353 --> 12:35.654
If the children are given liberty without
the right sense of their duty

12:35.855 --> 12:40.596
and the right sense about themselves,
what will happen to them?

12:40.797 --> 12:47.954
Why children are born to parents?
It is to get spoiled,

12:48.155 --> 12:53.466
to have liberty or to get some guidance?

12:53.849 --> 12:57.371
You cannot guide your children.

12:57.572 --> 13:03.141
They are so rude, they are so arrogant.

13:03.342 --> 13:09.197
They have gone off, completely.

13:09.398 --> 13:13.110
You know for one month we had to struggle
with these western children.

13:13.333 --> 13:16.539
And we had come to the point of urge
of closing down that school

13:16.740 --> 13:20.849
because they were really violent children,

13:21.050 --> 13:24.050
as if coming from some jungle.

13:24.257 --> 13:28.308
Even the jungle animals have some sense.

13:29.244 --> 13:32.974
So you have to think about your children.

13:33.175 --> 13:36.531
What's going to happen to your children?

13:36.732 --> 13:40.622
What is going to be their situation?

13:40.995 --> 13:46.938
If they are going to live in the same
manner in this dirt,

13:47.139 --> 13:54.413
these children will turn out to be waste,
just a waste!

13:54.614 --> 14:00.517
They will have no education, no character,
no personality,

14:00.718 --> 14:10.457
they'll end up with AIDS or with drugs
or something like that.

14:10.658 --> 14:16.829
I do not see any future for the children
of France, no future.

14:20.012 --> 14:25.417
And you have to fight that, "We want
to have future for our children,

14:25.618 --> 14:28.277
we don't want them to be ruined."

14:28.478 --> 14:32.494
And you must have courage to fight it.

14:32.695 --> 14:37.005
It's very important to have courage.

14:37.206 --> 14:42.297
If you do not have the courage, you cannot
fight it.

14:42.498 --> 14:48.564
And today's puja is to give that courage
in your hearts.

14:48.765 --> 14:54.644
See it all around you, what's happening?

14:54.845 --> 14:58.567
You are all nicely enjoying yourself
in the realm of God,

14:58.768 --> 15:00.666
you have entered into the Kingdom of God.

15:00.867 --> 15:05.148
But what about the rest of the people?

15:05.366 --> 15:10.277
The majority of the people, where are they
going?

15:13.663 --> 15:27.590
What is going to be the future of this
horrible Mooladhara place?

15:29.344 --> 15:34.953
Now Freud has been discovered
as a fraudulent man,

15:35.154 --> 15:38.067
and now there are books after so many
years,

15:38.268 --> 15:42.247
when he has already ruined the people
all over the world.

15:42.448 --> 15:46.928
But the worst of all, they have ruined
here.

15:51.068 --> 15:53.791
It's a responsibility specially
of the women I think,

15:53.992 --> 15:57.837
because they are responsible for
the society.

15:58.038 --> 16:03.414
The society of France has gone to dogs

16:03.850 --> 16:10.030
and for you to now take up upon yourself

16:10.231 --> 16:16.664
to talk against this kind of anarchy

16:16.865 --> 16:22.275
that is working out the destruction
of your families.

16:24.018 --> 16:32.572
If the women decide, I am sure, they
can very, very easily work it out.

16:32.773 --> 16:37.842
Instead of asking for liberation
nonsensical,

16:38.418 --> 16:43.067
you better ask for the ascent of this
country.

16:43.268 --> 16:46.429
I know, I've worked very hard and you are
all there.

16:46.630 --> 16:49.422
I am very happy to see that you all
are there

16:49.623 --> 17:01.277
to fulfill the desires of the Divine.

17:01.478 --> 17:07.203
Because now you should know in a very
big way,

17:07.404 --> 17:13.235
masses of masses of people will be
destroyed.

17:17.014 --> 17:21.454
Not from without but from within.

17:23.188 --> 17:29.138
Suddenly you'll hear so many millions
disappear with this disease.

17:32.992 --> 17:38.099
Also you must protect yourself, all of you:

17:38.300 --> 17:45.817
always give yourself a bandhan; always
lead a clean life.

17:46.018 --> 17:52.244
There are certain hygienic rules of Sahaja
Yoga, please try to follow them.

17:52.445 --> 17:55.617
Do not neglect it.

17:55.818 --> 17:59.837
If somebody gets AIDS, you'll not have him
in Sahaja Yoga,

18:00.038 --> 18:04.487
whatever may be the conditions, whatever
may be the reason.

18:06.580 --> 18:11.980
You have to be very careful, also I would
say never treat a AIDS patient.

18:12.181 --> 18:14.766
Like the one yesterday who was arguing
with Me,

18:14.967 --> 18:19.083
actually because they have only two types
of people:

18:19.284 --> 18:26.310
one who are arrogant and another one
which always

18:28.540 --> 18:33.322
think that it's better they should die.
They have no will to live.

18:33.523 --> 18:38.041
So there are only two types of people,
either right-sided or left-sided.

18:38.242 --> 18:42.798
And they can never ascend. We have tried,
we have tried.

18:42.999 --> 18:46.108
Of course, one person is living
for the last seven years,

18:46.346 --> 18:51.753
but still he has no faith in himself.

18:51.954 --> 18:57.259
Maybe next generation might be better on,
if they come back.

18:57.460 --> 19:01.628
But as far as this generation is concerned,

19:01.829 --> 19:06.584
you should know your responsibility
is very great.

19:06.785 --> 19:11.528
All the Sahaja Yogis must take a vow

19:11.729 --> 19:16.565
that they'll fight this society and try
to save their country

19:16.766 --> 19:22.331
and their countrymen from a complete
disaster.

19:22.532 --> 19:25.900
There is going to be no war,

19:26.101 --> 19:31.168
only they will fight themselves and die.

19:33.144 --> 19:35.425
It's a very serious matter.

19:35.626 --> 19:41.002
For that, we decided to have this puja
of Durga today

19:41.203 --> 19:45.471
that all negativity should be destroyed.

19:45.672 --> 19:52.678
So many Deities build up the body of Kali.

19:52.879 --> 19:58.395
Every part of Her body was created
by a Deity, looked after by a Deity,

19:58.596 --> 20:06.380
and is also, later on, is reflected
in you all.

20:08.574 --> 20:12.648
So they say that God has made human beings
in His own image,

20:12.849 --> 20:16.470
I would say, I've made you in My own
image,

20:16.671 --> 20:21.584
all the Deities at your disposal.

20:21.785 --> 20:26.082
They're all with you, and they have created
you - if you see it minutely -

20:26.283 --> 20:31.572
it is the Deities who have brought forth
all the beauty that you had.

20:31.773 --> 20:41.371
They have made all this beautiful
congregation, beautiful transformation,

20:41.572 --> 20:49.227
and they have created such angelic people
out of you.

20:49.903 --> 20:52.499
They are always working it out,

20:52.700 --> 20:58.173
but one thing you have to do is to have
the drive.

20:58.374 --> 21:03.525
You had pure desire to ascend, but
for what?

21:03.726 --> 21:08.157
You want to have the light, but for what?

21:08.358 --> 21:12.304
You want to become gurus, for what?

21:12.505 --> 21:17.098
To save people, for their salvation.

21:17.328 --> 21:20.742
Only through your channels I can work out
Sahaja Yoga.

21:20.943 --> 21:24.174
If I could work out Myself, I would have.

21:24.375 --> 21:28.932
It's not question of killing one rakshasa.

21:29.133 --> 21:34.048
God knows how many there are, rakshasas
and rakshasas.

21:34.249 --> 21:40.255
And they are everywhere, even within you
they were.

21:40.456 --> 21:43.952
Now they have gone away.

21:47.296 --> 21:53.086
So you have to do full justice to Sahaja
Yoga, that's very important.

21:53.287 --> 21:56.281
I knew the puja would be very late,
because Kali's puja

21:56.482 --> 22:02.845
is always done in the night, after twelve.
So it had to be this way.

22:03.046 --> 22:05.480
Though last night I slept at four o'clock
and I,  tonight,

22:05.681 --> 22:12.676
I don't know what time I will sleep -
it all works out. It's all worked out.

22:12.877 --> 22:15.927
But you have to have deliberations
and you have to think,

22:16.128 --> 22:18.740
“What can we do to change this?”

22:18.941 --> 22:25.731
Why not write some books, why not write
some experiences?

22:25.932 --> 22:31.450
Get them published in French only. Let
the French know what’s happening outside.

22:31.651 --> 22:35.803
Get some of the books translated –

22:37.165 --> 22:43.419
some American books, some English books.
At least give quotations from there.

22:43.620 --> 22:47.774
How they are unaware. First this Catholic
church has to go away.

22:47.975 --> 22:54.207
It will, no doubt, I am sure about it.
They are literally frightened of us.

23:00.122 --> 23:06.759
And we have to now really show them
what we are capable of.

23:08.791 --> 23:16.563
And the funniest thing is that a president
has chosen

23:16.764 --> 23:19.131
his lady-friend as the prime minister.

23:19.332 --> 23:26.326
I mean, it’s not possible in any sensible
country. It’s never heard of.

23:26.527 --> 23:31.668
I must say, English are thousand times
better.

23:32.556 --> 23:34.994
They are really very good.

23:35.195 --> 23:39.054
At least, as far as administration
is concerned,

23:39.255 --> 23:43.217
as far as their parliament is concerned.
Their justice is not stupid like this,

23:43.418 --> 23:48.352
it’s based on law, not based on the mood
of a magistrate.

23:48.553 --> 23:51.855
How you are still continuing with such
stupidity

23:52.056 --> 23:56.772
which are really even before medieval age:

23:56.973 --> 24:02.876
primitive, people are absolutely primitive
to accept such laws.

24:03.077 --> 24:10.996
At least you can write a book about
the strange laws of French, one title.

24:15.206 --> 24:18.837
How it has harmed. There is a very nice
book, “Fraudulent Freud”.

24:19.038 --> 24:23.420
Please read that, and see how Freud
has ruined the French,

24:23.621 --> 24:27.054
how their brains are twisted, how they
have twisted ideas.

24:27.255 --> 24:31.453
You are all so intelligent, clever people.

24:33.826 --> 24:41.189
So if not with the sword, Kali has to work
through the pen.

24:48.114 --> 24:54.210
I never knew it was in that bad shape,
though I knew it was.

24:55.671 --> 25:00.836
So this is a challenge for all of us,

25:01.037 --> 25:08.117
and let Me see what you can write, all
of you, put together your experiences:

25:08.318 --> 25:11.648
how the French parents behave, how
the grandparents behave,

25:11.849 --> 25:16.089
what’s happening in this country and
all that.

25:21.391 --> 25:25.584
They are living in fool’s paradise.

25:27.702 --> 25:35.942
They don’t know how destruction is just
hanging over their heads.

25:39.755 --> 25:44.976
Though you are all saved, but you have
to think of others,

25:45.177 --> 25:52.662
that is what Sahaja Yoga is, that is not
only that we care for the bhaktas –

25:52.863 --> 26:01.302
like Kali just wanted to protect
the bhaktas, the sadhakas.

26:02.040 --> 26:11.034
But you have to protect many, many more
people.

26:11.235 --> 26:17.973
You have all the powers, just assume them
and use them.

26:19.775 --> 26:22.729
You can do it.

26:22.930 --> 26:26.289
Your media is the worst of all

26:26.490 --> 26:30.781
and we can start a newspaper also calling
it anti-media.

26:30.982 --> 26:34.205
What can they do to us?

26:34.406 --> 26:39.603
Or some sort of an independent name,
we can give it.

26:40.150 --> 26:43.724
And it should be open for people who
are suffering

26:43.925 --> 26:50.363
from media sensationalization.
They can write:

26:50.564 --> 26:54.358
how the media is harming them, how they
are giving false reports and things.

26:54.559 --> 26:57.685
We can! Why not?

27:00.757 --> 27:03.986
I am sure it will work out.

27:05.567 --> 27:10.571
Think it over what you can do with
your pen.

27:14.303 --> 27:18.680
Whatever you have gained, whatever you
are enjoying: beautiful music,

27:18.881 --> 27:22.377
all the pujas, everything. But think
of others.

27:22.578 --> 27:29.071
They are already drunk and tossing
their heads on their pillows.

27:29.272 --> 27:35.406
Think of them. They, when will they feel
this joy?

27:35.625 --> 27:38.250
I simply feel pity for them

27:38.451 --> 27:42.809
that they should have taken to all these
bad things,

27:43.010 --> 27:45.011
because of the suppression of the Catholic
church.

27:45.212 --> 27:47.419
It’s the Catholic church which has
suppressed them,

27:47.620 --> 27:50.781
that’s why they have come to this.
No other way –

27:50.982 --> 27:55.420
reason why they should accept this kind
of thing.

27:59.709 --> 28:04.436
In Sahaja Yoga, we do not do all these
things, we are in the centre.

28:04.637 --> 28:08.658
We do not have this kind of problems,
because we don’t suppress anyone,

28:08.859 --> 28:12.983
nor do we go to the other extreme
of indulgences.

28:13.184 --> 28:16.633
I think the whole Europe can be divided
into two types of people:

28:16.834 --> 28:21.000
one are Anglo-Saxons, and others are
Latins.

28:21.201 --> 28:26.094
Anglo-Saxons are right-sided and the Latins
are left-sided:

28:26.295 --> 28:33.691
they cry, weep, miserable, they indulge
into dirt and filth.

28:34.320 --> 28:37.389
Just these two types they are.

28:37.590 --> 28:43.249
Now, unluckily you are in the Latin side.

28:44.007 --> 28:50.358
So here, Catholic church is prospering.

28:50.993 --> 28:56.444
Now, if you see to the Latin side and
understand

28:56.645 --> 29:00.026
to what extent they have gone to the left
side,

29:00.227 --> 29:05.318
and getting to the left side what diseases
you get, very nicely,

29:05.519 --> 29:08.812
make a list of them.

29:09.013 --> 29:13.485
So what I said will work out in France:

29:13.686 --> 29:17.504
the left-sided incurable diseases.

29:17.705 --> 29:21.279
As it is, you walk on the street, you find
at least three, four

29:21.480 --> 29:26.711
mad people, lunatic people walking,
you’ll find them.

29:27.514 --> 29:32.259
Very simple it is. You don’t have to go
to the lunatic asylum, on the street!

29:32.460 --> 29:38.129
They’ll be all talking and saying things,
but it’s all there.

29:38.330 --> 29:41.767
“That’s why they drink, that’s why they
are miserable.”.

29:41.967 --> 29:47.528
I do not know what are the statistics
of the diseases.

29:51.936 --> 29:56.773
So the problem is extremely grave,
very grave.

29:56.974 --> 30:00.291
And you have to work it out,

30:00.492 --> 30:05.407
with the gravity of your Gurupada which
you have asked Me the other day –

30:05.608 --> 30:11.354
you asked for the status of a guru,
for ladies as well as for men.

30:11.555 --> 30:16.110
And I said, “All right, start!”

30:17.403 --> 30:22.670
I hope you all have heard the song
I’ve made, for asking.

30:22.871 --> 30:25.301
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Marathi]

30:25.502 --> 30:27.085
All right, once they will sing that song.

30:27.286 --> 30:29.582
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Marathi]
All right.

30:29.783 --> 30:40.195
They will sing that song to you. There are
different requests from the Mother,

30:40.396 --> 30:44.559
and in this the last one is that: “Mother,
now you give us

30:44.760 --> 30:48.920
the Gurupada, the status of a guru.”

30:49.121 --> 30:54.669
But every guru has a duty: to cleanse
the society in which he lives.

30:54.870 --> 30:57.930
It’s his duty, he has to fight it.

30:58.131 --> 31:02.682
Christ fought it alone, so many saints
fought it alone,

31:02.883 --> 31:07.980
they were treated very badly, put in jail,
given poisons, things, but they fought it.

31:08.181 --> 31:13.281
In the same way you stand on Truth,
and you have to fight it.

31:15.539 --> 31:18.914
Because you are saints.

31:22.446 --> 31:24.812
May God bless you.
