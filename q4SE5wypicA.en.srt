00:00:10,951 --> 00:00:17,243
We may have many concepts about our
religion or caste or race but these are

2
00:00:17,243 --> 00:00:25,251
only concepts. Every human-being has within
him the desire to want to be one with God.

3
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:32,850
That desire, if it is strong enough, it
will be fulfilled and in Her presence,

4
00:00:32,989 --> 00:00:39,469
that desire can actually manifest itself,
you do get connected, you feel the vibrations,

5
00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:44,130
you feel the silence, deep silence within,
which is the thoughtless awareness.

6
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:51,409
Then, of course, how they take it forward,
is left to them. It is an individual's own

7
00:00:51,409 --> 00:00:57,394
sense of responsibility and the strength of
his or her own desire, to take it forward.

[SAHAJA AARTI]

00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:23,250
India is blessed by people who believe that
there is God and one has to be surrendered

10
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:29,892
to God and one has to try to get closeness
to God but that's what it is. The rest of

11
00:01:29,892 --> 00:01:37,501
it is, we are divided into many, many
castes, many, many religions, many sects

12
00:01:37,501 --> 00:01:47,113
and much ritualism. And when you break out
of that and we realize it we are all people,

13
00:01:47,113 --> 00:01:53,791
who are born from this earth of India and
that we can all achieve a sense of realization

14
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:58,696
and can get close to a sense of God,
then it will change the way

15
00:01:58,696 --> 00:02:01,163
Indians also work with each other.
