WEBVTT

00:00.799 --> 00:05.750
I asked some of the boys, “What is your
policy?”

00:05.750 --> 00:08.200
They said, “We have no policy."

00:08.200 --> 00:10.530
“Then what is your aim?”

00:10.530 --> 00:12.130
“We have no aim."

00:12.130 --> 00:14.260
“Then why are you doing this nonsense?”

00:14.260 --> 00:18.589
They said, “Because whatever the elders
tell us, we do it."

00:18.589 --> 00:21.519
I said, “Have you no personality?

00:21.519 --> 00:22.519
Nothing?”

00:22.519 --> 00:29.960
Is exactly what happened when this hippy movement
started.

00:29.960 --> 00:36.280
Some so-called intellectuals started this
horrible hippy movement in the West.

00:36.280 --> 00:42.720
And when they found they cannot do anything
about it, they found it’s going to fail,

00:42.720 --> 00:50.090
so many children lost their education, so
many children I know became pregnant, girls

00:50.090 --> 00:56.070
and boys [sadist scout/squat].

00:56.070 --> 01:01.340
All that took them to the extreme that they
became violent.

01:01.340 --> 01:08.700
But unless and until there is a change within
yourself, how can we change anything outside?

01:08.700 --> 01:10.660
We cannot.

01:10.660 --> 01:16.910
And the first seven people I fought were all
hippies.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.750
Very difficult.

01:18.750 --> 01:25.340
They called themselves hippies but they used
to hog like a pig.

01:25.340 --> 01:33.500
They wanted all the comforts, everything free,
extremely dominating and quarrelsome people.

01:33.500 --> 01:37.090
But the foundation was laid on them.

01:37.090 --> 01:38.270
Very surprising.

01:38.270 --> 01:45.050
But I had to work on them for at least four
years regularly.

01:45.050 --> 01:56.650
So that is how Sahaja Yoga started, and today
you know how much it has spread, how far it

01:56.650 --> 01:57.780
has gone.

01:57.780 --> 02:02.740
Only in Maharashtra this problem is there
of so-called intellectuals, this is called

02:02.740 --> 02:05.990
themselves, but they have no intelligence.

02:05.990 --> 02:08.700
I talked to one man; I got fed up.

02:08.700 --> 02:11.090
He didn’t know anything about spirituality,
he didn’t know anything about medicine,

02:11.090 --> 02:12.620
he didn’t know anything about science.

02:12.620 --> 02:17.800
I said, “Now, what do you know?”

02:17.800 --> 02:20.760
So it was impossible.

02:20.760 --> 02:26.615
So such people who are jobless ? we call them
[nikaam bekaar] ? they have no work, they

02:26.615 --> 02:31.520
are starting all such things and we should
not be upset with them.

02:31.520 --> 02:37.600
They are trying to create problems and they
are getting money from some sources.

02:37.600 --> 02:45.840
They are afraid, I think the politicians are
afraid, perhaps, that Sahaja Yoga may turn

02:45.840 --> 02:54.390
their tables down because we believe in honesty,
and maybe a day may come when these honest

02:54.390 --> 02:56.240
people might harm them, perhaps.

02:56.240 --> 02:58.460
I do not know why.

02:58.460 --> 03:05.350
This may be one of the reasons these people
are frightened of us.

03:05.350 --> 03:16.650
Or whatever it is we have to understand that
for doing any great work one has to sacrifice.

03:16.650 --> 03:22.290
Of course, you are not going to be crucified
like Christ, no.

03:22.290 --> 03:27.500
Nor you have to sacrifice as my parents sacrificed
for the independence of this country.

03:27.500 --> 03:30.349
Nor you are going to be tortured.

03:30.349 --> 03:34.350
But really, inconveniences you may have.

03:34.350 --> 03:40.620
But I must thank you very much because of
you are coming here and singing Marathi songs.

03:40.620 --> 03:46.080
They are quite impressed and they think it’s
only possible because you are all Sahaja yogis.

03:46.080 --> 03:51.180
Otherwise you could not have done.

03:51.180 --> 03:59.250
So if there are any inconveniences think that
it’s a joke; that’s all.

03:59.250 --> 04:06.690
Today I was thinking we should do the Puja
of Shri chakra and Lalita chakra which we

04:06.690 --> 04:07.740
have never done.

04:07.740 --> 04:16.769
This is the right place to do these two chakras
today.

04:16.769 --> 04:26.449
Lot has been written about Shri chakra and
about Lalita chakra, but to understand fundamentally

04:26.449 --> 04:40.129
the left side when it reaches up to Vishuddhi,
then it uses on the right side the Shri chakra,

04:40.129 --> 04:48.659
on the left side the Lalita chakra, to manifest
itself.

04:48.659 --> 05:01.559
These two chakras are the ones who manifest
all that you see.

05:01.559 --> 05:15.210
But these chakras are the ones who emit vibrations
of different kinds, and because of their angularities,

05:15.210 --> 05:21.919
like if you have some sort of a cardboard
attached with small, small holes of different

05:21.919 --> 05:27.349
colors and which rotates all the time, you
get different colors.

05:27.349 --> 05:31.479
Also you can get different permutations and
combinations.

05:31.479 --> 05:40.650
In the same way, different permutations and
combinations are created, and that is how

05:40.650 --> 05:44.979
you get all the advantages of Sahaja Yoga.

05:44.979 --> 05:48.029
So these two chakras are very important.

05:48.029 --> 05:56.110
I do not know if you know of any mantras about
Shri chakra but I’ll give you a book, later

05:56.110 --> 06:01.229
on I’ll translate it to you and you can
compose something for Shri chakra.

06:01.229 --> 06:08.869
Shri chakra on the right side, Lalita chakra
on the left side, so what we are really worshipping

06:08.869 --> 06:15.960
today is Mahasaraswati power and Mahakali
power, both put together.

06:15.960 --> 06:20.309
So now we started combining things, not individual.

06:20.309 --> 06:26.210
Now, these two energies are very important.

06:26.210 --> 06:31.129
Without the energy, without the power, nothing
exists.

06:31.129 --> 06:43.710
For example, if this light had no power to
give light or to burn, it is useless.

06:43.710 --> 06:53.220
In the same way, without getting your realization
you are useless because your power is not

06:53.220 --> 06:56.499
awakened, at least not complete.

06:56.499 --> 07:13.389
But these two powers give us lots of benefits
even without realization.

07:13.389 --> 07:23.240
Whatever you see in this world created is
done by these two chakras of the Adi Shakti.

07:23.240 --> 07:26.150
But here the power doesn’t move.

07:26.150 --> 07:28.910
It’s not moving.

07:28.910 --> 07:34.439
But in the human being the power start moving.

07:34.439 --> 07:47.969
And when it starts moving, then we can say
it is creating another world.

07:47.969 --> 07:51.889
But movement is not the only thing.

07:51.889 --> 08:00.530
This power acts, gives you intelligence, gives
you all kinds of things which you have as

08:00.530 --> 08:03.499
human beings.

08:03.499 --> 08:11.869
But later on this power itself becomes enlightened
within you when the left and right side both

08:11.869 --> 08:14.389
become enlightened.

08:14.389 --> 08:23.899
This enlightenment, you get it when you get
your Self-realization, but not immediately,

08:23.899 --> 08:24.899
not immediately.

08:24.899 --> 08:27.490
This, one should understand.

08:27.490 --> 08:39.000
For example, if you have pain or if your chakra
is catching, you have to use your hands.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.860
You cannot say that, “The energy is flowing
within me.

08:40.860 --> 08:41.860
So it’s all right.

08:41.860 --> 08:43.050
I can manage."

08:43.050 --> 08:45.870
It’s not like that.

08:45.870 --> 08:54.410
You have to use your hands to impart that
power to yourself or to others.

08:54.410 --> 09:00.470
If you have pain in the stomach then you can
say that, “If there’s energy in my stomach

09:00.470 --> 09:04.610
why should I have pain in the stomach?”

09:04.610 --> 09:09.750
But the play of these chakras have to come.

09:09.750 --> 09:20.920
And that is why you have to use your power
of your hands.

09:20.920 --> 09:31.300
If you cannot use your hands then you cannot
impart this energy.

09:31.300 --> 09:39.769
Many people have asked Me that, “Mother,
when will it move horizontal?”

09:39.769 --> 09:43.209
It will move horizontal, no doubt.

09:43.209 --> 09:44.920
It does.

09:44.920 --> 09:54.790
But even that horizontal movement is to be
guided by these two very important chakras.

09:54.790 --> 09:58.990
So you must understand the importance of these
two chakras within yourself.

09:58.990 --> 10:04.819
That’s why I have told many a times, “Don’t
move your head too many times."

10:04.819 --> 10:11.430
And this way many people talk, I mean, it’s
style of talking, “No, this, that,” very

10:11.430 --> 10:13.800
common with French, specially.

10:13.800 --> 10:18.100
That’s another way you are not respecting
your chakras.

10:18.100 --> 10:22.740
Shouldn’t move your shoulders too much.

10:22.740 --> 10:25.500
Mostly they talk like this.

10:25.500 --> 10:29.430
It’s anti-chakras, anti-chakras.

10:29.430 --> 10:33.000
Should keep your shoulders straight.

10:33.000 --> 10:42.230
When you are singing you can move your whole
upper part ? it’s all right ? but not your

10:42.230 --> 10:43.230
shoulders.

10:43.230 --> 10:53.310
This is the thing one has to understand that
these two centers are to be looked after.

10:53.310 --> 10:56.500
You can move your neck, your body, when you
are singing.

10:56.500 --> 11:05.589
It’s important, that helps, but not your
shoulders.

11:05.589 --> 11:07.600
Shoulders are to be kept intact.

11:07.600 --> 11:12.990
But while saying just, “Yes,” you need
not go on, “Yes, yes, yes, yes."

11:12.990 --> 11:18.940
It’s a very, very simple thing that it can
have a very bad effect.

11:18.940 --> 11:26.329
And those who move their shoulders too much
do not feel vibrations much because the chakras

11:26.329 --> 11:31.160
are not all right.

11:31.160 --> 11:38.190
It’s a very simple thing to be understood
that they are the most important chakras we

11:38.190 --> 11:46.720
have, and whatever is to be used out of this
Paramachaitanya they have to be used by these

11:46.720 --> 11:50.269
two centers.

11:50.269 --> 11:55.480
Even supposing your some chakra is catching
on your spinal chord, you have to use your

11:55.480 --> 11:59.260
hands.

11:59.260 --> 12:02.580
Somebody can say, “I can just put my attention."

12:02.580 --> 12:06.149
Doesn’t work out that good.

12:06.149 --> 12:12.279
Because yet your attention has not that reached
that stage where these chakras, like Lalita

12:12.279 --> 12:16.550
chakra and Shri chakra, obey your attention.

12:16.550 --> 12:22.439
They do not.

12:22.439 --> 12:25.930
So you have to work out with your hands.

12:25.930 --> 12:29.180
Be careful: don’t move your shoulders too
much.

12:29.180 --> 12:36.029
And if you see now Indians when they sing
bhajans they’ll move their whole body, they’ll

12:36.029 --> 12:38.670
do like this, but never their shoulders.

12:38.670 --> 12:44.250
The shoulders will move in the same way as
the neck is moving.

12:44.250 --> 12:51.120
They might move their neck also but they’ll
never move their shoulders like this, and

12:51.120 --> 12:55.889
it’s regarded as inauspicious according
to Indian standards.

12:55.889 --> 13:03.459
Because of this culture based on what the
saints have told and also about many seers

13:03.459 --> 13:11.480
have told, it is more related to spiritual
life than to materialistic life.

13:11.480 --> 13:16.649
Now the materialistic life, unless and until
there is the foundation of the spiritual life,

13:16.649 --> 13:24.060
takes you to a very partial development, you
can say.

13:24.060 --> 13:33.569
But to get a full development you must have
your foundation on spirituality.

13:33.569 --> 13:42.110
That’s why spirituality being the foundation
has to be deep, has to be fully equipped,

13:42.110 --> 13:45.110
has to be absolutely perfect.

13:45.110 --> 13:48.949
Then the whole building can be built.

13:48.949 --> 13:52.740
It’s gone wrong in the West; doesn’t matter.

13:52.740 --> 14:03.360
Now you can build it up and then you’ll
be surprised how you become really solid people.

14:03.360 --> 14:08.629
This is a very short talk about Shri chakra.

14:08.629 --> 14:14.779
I think I should sit down and write all about
it and it would be nice handing it for you

14:14.779 --> 14:17.879
to read.

14:17.879 --> 14:29.939
But you must know that beyond thought, when
you go, these chakras become extremely efficient

14:29.939 --> 14:37.509
because the thought puts a pressure on them,
and because of the pressure the movement of

14:37.509 --> 14:42.300
these chakras is very slow and ineffective.

14:42.300 --> 14:48.560
But once you can get out of your thoughts
and go into thoughtless awareness, then these

14:48.560 --> 14:53.269
chakras start working it out and you start
moving much deeper into your own being.

14:53.269 --> 14:55.220
[The lecture continues in Hindi but becomes
inaudible after some time]

14:55.220 --> 14:59.560
I must say that this beautiful Earth has created
so many beautiful things.

14:59.560 --> 15:07.320
But She Herself is nothing but detached, simple
Mother Earth.

15:07.320 --> 15:11.470
Perhaps that’s My condition, too.

15:11.470 --> 15:17.779
When it comes to creation I can create beautiful
things.

15:17.779 --> 15:21.950
You are so beautiful, too, creatures.

15:21.950 --> 15:30.589
But as far as I am concerned I do not think
that I require any one of these things or

15:30.589 --> 15:36.800
I’m bothered about them, or need them or
tempted by them.

15:36.800 --> 15:41.800
So what Grégoire has said is because they
are insisting that they are going to give

15:41.800 --> 15:46.449
Me presents every year and that’s why this
is a delude to them.

15:46.449 --> 15:49.170
But I’ve been telling them that there’s
no need now.

15:49.170 --> 15:54.529
Let’s say, you all consider it, is only
no need to give so many presents.

15:54.529 --> 15:59.740
What you can do now to start reducing the
number of presents you give Me.

15:59.740 --> 16:01.519
One country can give one present.

16:01.519 --> 16:08.420
If you can do that I’ll be thankful, but
I’ll have to build another house.

16:08.420 --> 16:19.339
And the grandeur and all these things are
created by Me but never enjoyed by Me.

16:19.339 --> 16:21.899
I just enjoy Myself; that’s all.

16:21.899 --> 16:28.199
And Myself is so big, it is such a big thing,
that I don’t know what it means; it means

16:28.199 --> 16:32.670
grandeur, or nature, or anything, or you all
people.

16:32.670 --> 16:35.160
I enjoy everything of it.

16:35.160 --> 16:39.269
So for Me there’s no need for you to.

16:39.269 --> 16:45.709
Now as he said that those people came, three
of them ? Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha ? to give

16:45.709 --> 16:47.300
presents to Christ.

16:47.300 --> 16:50.180
Yes, they did.

16:50.180 --> 16:52.509
And you have given Me, too.

16:52.509 --> 16:58.130
But now I think it’s better that you people
reduce some quantity at least.

16:58.130 --> 17:03.769
I’ll be very thankful that if something
could be done like that, and from next year

17:03.769 --> 17:08.200
we should try to make it less and less and
less.

17:08.200 --> 17:15.050
Because it’s very sweet of you to have given
Me all those things, because I enjoyed them,

17:15.050 --> 17:21.200
they are beautiful things, and when I see
them I remember your good heart.

17:21.200 --> 17:28.670
But you know that Mother is too simple and
though I can create all kinds of things, as

17:28.670 --> 17:32.850
far as I am concerned I am too simple.

17:32.850 --> 17:33.850
And also Mr.

17:33.850 --> 17:38.080
Shrivastava so many times, says also, “You’ve
got so many saris but you’ll go on with

17:38.080 --> 17:40.550
Your white sari all the time."

17:40.550 --> 17:51.300
The reason is, you see, a simple personality
can only create beautiful things.

17:51.300 --> 18:02.210
A simple heart can only create nice things,
because simplicity at the simple level is

18:02.210 --> 18:03.600
so simple.

18:03.600 --> 18:10.380
Like you are made of seven chakras, seven
chakras, then the permutations of these seven

18:10.380 --> 18:11.790
chakras, that’s all.

18:11.790 --> 18:17.250
But supposing you start from outside then
you’ll have to go to medical science or

18:17.250 --> 18:20.020
you’ll have to go to another complicated
thing.

18:20.020 --> 18:22.050
But basically, fundamentally, it’s too simple.

18:22.050 --> 18:28.490
That’s why Sahaja Yoga is very simple, because
we are dealing with the fundamental things.

18:28.490 --> 18:35.390
So fundamentally, if you are simple then everything
that you do is just a combination and permutation

18:35.390 --> 18:42.050
of all these things, and all these things
when they are put together they make such

18:42.050 --> 18:43.050
beautiful things.

18:43.050 --> 18:48.640
For example, as I have told you once I was
travelling and we went to a place called Palitana

18:48.640 --> 18:52.250
known to be a very beautiful, beautifully
carved place.

18:52.250 --> 18:57.460
And we had to walk, I don’t know, for three
miles at least, climbing up or something like

18:57.460 --> 18:58.460
that.

18:58.460 --> 19:00.930
With Me was My daughter and My son-in-law.

19:00.930 --> 19:03.050
Went up and there was a little temple.

19:03.050 --> 19:04.810
They wanted to rest.

19:04.810 --> 19:07.880
And also we laid down ourselves there.

19:07.880 --> 19:14.460
And as soon as I saw all these beautiful elephants
were there, so I told My son-in-law, “Look

19:14.460 --> 19:15.690
at these elephants.

19:15.690 --> 19:18.150
All their tails are twisted differently."

19:18.150 --> 19:21.300
He said, “Mummy, we are so fed up.

19:21.300 --> 19:26.240
How do you have energy to see the tails?”

19:26.240 --> 19:31.080
I said, “Because I see the tails I don’t
feel tired.

19:31.080 --> 19:32.540
That’s the point.

19:32.540 --> 19:35.160
Because I see the beauty of these tails, I
— ”.

19:35.160 --> 19:39.030
So you see, even in simple things there is
so much of beauty.

19:39.030 --> 19:50.750
In very, very ordinary persons you’ll find
that they have a very beautiful things and

19:50.750 --> 20:01.930
very nice way of saying things, very simple
talks of children like that, it’s so simple,

20:01.930 --> 20:06.120
so straightforward, and whatever they say
it’s so deep.

20:06.120 --> 20:12.210
So whatever is deep is simple, but when it
is expressed outside it can have lots of permutations

20:12.210 --> 20:18.660
and combinations and it can work out in a
beautiful way.

20:18.660 --> 20:19.700
I must tell you, I had no strain in making
this house, nothing.

20:19.700 --> 20:25.741
I was not bothered at all.

20:25.741 --> 20:30.030
I found everything so easily; I brought it
here, put it down here, I never even thought

20:30.030 --> 20:31.030
there’s strain or anything.

20:31.030 --> 20:32.030
Everybody says, “What a concept."

20:32.030 --> 20:33.390
But I never conceived anything.

20:33.390 --> 20:36.210
I mean, I just don’t know.

20:36.210 --> 20:40.430
What is a concept is there; I just told, “To
Me is nothing great."

20:40.430 --> 20:45.370
The whole world is there for us to see and
to be fascinated.

20:45.370 --> 20:52.960
But behind all that, all this world and everything
is created with the very little, simple idea

20:52.960 --> 21:00.380
of God, that you all have to enter into the
Kingdom of God.

21:00.380 --> 21:04.070
That’s all; such a simple idea.

21:04.070 --> 21:09.110
So He’s created such a beautiful world,
then he created all kinds of things to bring

21:09.110 --> 21:15.530
you to the human level, and now just simple
thing is to enter into the Kingdom of God.

21:15.530 --> 21:20.550
You should not complicate yourself too much
and once you do that you will be surprised

21:20.550 --> 21:25.200
how beautifully you will be able to produce.

21:25.200 --> 21:28.310
Even some artists were extremely simple by
nature.

21:28.310 --> 21:36.010
Like Ravi Shankar, you know, and his guru,
he has got Alla Raka and Ali Akbar; all these

21:36.010 --> 21:37.210
were his disciples.

21:37.210 --> 21:39.824
Such a great genius man, such a simple man,
I tell you.

21:39.824 --> 21:41.180
And he knew Me very well.

21:41.180 --> 21:44.890
He used to call Me “Ma”; he used to call
Me “Mother” from the very beginning.

21:44.890 --> 21:57.470
And one day he brought one little deer, a
baby deer, brought it to Me.

21:57.470 --> 21:59.300
I said, “What’s the matter?”

21:59.300 --> 22:03.140
He said, “See, this deer was crying too
much.

22:03.140 --> 22:04.270
So I brought it to You."

22:04.270 --> 22:06.350
But I said, “For, why for Me?”

22:06.350 --> 22:09.340
“So, You see, he will feel the love of his
Mother.

22:09.340 --> 22:11.160
So You just caress him."

22:11.160 --> 22:15.940
Imagine, such a great artist coming like a
little baby to Me, making that.

22:15.940 --> 22:17.750
I was so surprised at him.

22:17.750 --> 22:20.050
Look at him; such a simple man.

22:20.050 --> 22:22.850
He’s doing that.

22:22.850 --> 22:28.690
And you see, if you see the children when
they love, how genuine they are, how they

22:28.690 --> 22:29.690
work it out.

22:29.690 --> 22:30.840
The same place there was a child.

22:30.840 --> 22:32.720
He was very fond of Me.

22:32.720 --> 22:43.420
And one day he decided to bring some pumpkins
for Me.

22:43.420 --> 22:46.050
So he brought one to Me.

22:46.050 --> 22:47.660
I saw him bringing in the thing.

22:47.660 --> 22:49.510
He said, “All right, just wait."

22:49.510 --> 22:54.190
Then there was, he went back, and there was
another one kept little further.

22:54.190 --> 22:55.590
He brought that.

22:55.590 --> 22:59.710
He had put nine of them in different places.

22:59.710 --> 23:01.900
One by one he was bringing them.

23:01.900 --> 23:04.340
He brought nine pumpkins to give Me.

23:04.340 --> 23:05.340
So sweet.

23:05.340 --> 23:07.980
But I said, “Why did you bring nine?”

23:07.980 --> 23:13.470
“Because I don’t know which one you like
so I brought all of them."

23:13.470 --> 23:17.770
So simple and so touching; I mean, just [touch/touches/tears/turns]
your heart.

23:17.770 --> 23:19.530
So we have to be simple people.

23:19.530 --> 23:26.030
We have to talk to each other in a simple
way, not in a complicated way, in a very simple,

23:26.030 --> 23:27.120
sweet manner.

23:27.120 --> 23:31.600
That’s how we are going to create a beautiful
world.

23:31.600 --> 23:38.750
So I would request all of you to be very kindly
and very gentle with each other, especially

23:38.750 --> 23:42.130
for the newly marrying couples.

23:42.130 --> 23:45.280
Try to be nice.

23:45.280 --> 23:48.150
Nobody is going to dominate you if you are
nice.

23:48.150 --> 23:50.760
It’s only you dominate yourself.

23:50.760 --> 23:54.540
And don’t try to control your husbands or
your wives.

23:54.540 --> 23:55.540
Let them be.

23:55.540 --> 23:57.530
Let them enjoy their freedom.

23:57.530 --> 23:59.390
They are not going to do anything wrong.

23:59.390 --> 24:03.870
So some people try to control too much and
there are problems.

24:03.870 --> 24:07.610
So please do not try to control like, “If
I am keeping it here, they’ll keep it there."

24:07.610 --> 24:08.750
There’s no need.

24:08.750 --> 24:09.750
Let it be.

24:09.750 --> 24:12.370
Doesn’t matter; nothing so serious.

24:12.370 --> 24:16.840
But on small, small things, I’ve seen, such
marriages fizzle out.

24:16.840 --> 24:19.470
And it is absolutely wrong.

24:19.470 --> 24:22.110
So for marriages today, it’s a very auspicious
day.

24:22.110 --> 24:25.670
So many people have been engaged to be married.

24:25.670 --> 24:30.660
But one thing you must remember, that you
should not lose your connection with joy.

24:30.660 --> 24:31.840
It’s stupidity.

24:31.840 --> 24:36.660
When two nice birds are together they should
chirp and laugh and enjoy.

24:36.660 --> 24:43.790
Instead of that, if they start pricking each
other, what should we call them?

24:43.790 --> 24:46.890
So today it’s a great joy for Me.

24:46.890 --> 24:51.110
So many people are engaged and are going to
get married.

24:51.110 --> 24:55.460
But now, understand your responsibility that
nothing is to be done.

24:55.460 --> 24:58.060
You have to be just sahaj; don’t have to
do anything.

24:58.060 --> 24:59.310
“We are working out."

24:59.310 --> 25:02.200
You cannot work out marriage; you cannot work
out.

25:02.200 --> 25:08.470
Just know about your husband or about your
wife and just try to enjoy whatever they are.

25:08.470 --> 25:15.100
I mean, I do enjoy that way about My husband,
so many things which may sound little queer

25:15.100 --> 25:16.290
to people, but I enjoy it.

25:16.290 --> 25:20.720
Because I know that’s a nice thing about
our human beings that they have varieties

25:20.720 --> 25:24.600
and they have little, different angles to
themselves.

25:24.600 --> 25:28.340
And these angles are to be enjoyed and to
be appreciated.

25:28.340 --> 25:31.030
If you can do that, then you will never fight.

25:31.030 --> 25:35.450
Because two persons cannot be alike; even
two leaves are not alike.

25:35.450 --> 25:37.240
So you should enjoy.

25:37.240 --> 25:43.400
Everybody has some sort of a super quality
thing or whatever it is or maybe some angle.

25:43.400 --> 25:45.240
Just enjoy that angle.

25:45.240 --> 25:49.710
You don’t have that; so let him have at
least, or let her have that.

25:49.710 --> 25:53.950
So today, special day is that so many marriages
have been fixed out.

25:53.950 --> 25:58.220
I don’t know how many ? he has not told
Me yet the number ? but quite a lot have been

25:58.220 --> 25:59.220
fixed.

25:59.220 --> 26:00.220
Sahaja yogi: Fifty.

26:00.220 --> 26:02.360
Shri Mataji: Fifty have been already fixed.

26:02.360 --> 26:03.360
All right.

26:03.360 --> 26:09.360
So now it’s a very big number and will be
more by the time we reach Ganapatipule.

26:09.360 --> 26:12.110
So let us not create problems out of this.

26:12.110 --> 26:13.150
You don’t have to sit down.

26:13.150 --> 26:17.920
I have seen after marriage they start thinking,
“What, what do you think about him?”

26:17.920 --> 26:20.220
It’s like after realization you start thinking.

26:20.220 --> 26:23.420
Once you are married, you are not to think
then accept.

26:23.420 --> 26:24.460
Before marriage you think.

26:24.460 --> 26:27.510
What’s the use of thinking after marriage?

26:27.510 --> 26:32.650
It’s a very common thing.

26:32.650 --> 26:33.980
After marriage they start thinking.

26:33.980 --> 26:36.060
Then, after marriage you enjoy.

26:36.060 --> 26:38.290
After cooking the food you eat the food.

26:38.290 --> 26:42.750
Or after the food has been served then you
start thinking about it.

26:42.750 --> 26:43.750
It’s absurd.

26:43.750 --> 26:48.680
So this is a very common failing we have had
so far.

26:48.680 --> 26:52.840
I would like to tell you first of all, you
think before getting married and after getting

26:52.840 --> 26:54.620
married you carry on.

26:54.620 --> 26:55.740
And don’t try to control.

26:55.740 --> 26:57.900
Don’t try to dictate.

26:57.900 --> 26:59.600
Try to be nice and sweet.

26:59.600 --> 27:04.230
You don’t have to go out of the way, but
be normal and it will all work out.

27:04.230 --> 27:09.710
May God bless you all, specially all the girls
and boys who have been engaged.

27:09.710 --> 27:14.960
I bless you from My heart, and enjoy each
other; that’s the main point.

27:14.960 --> 27:16.530
So thank you very much.

27:16.530 --> 27:16.540
Thank you.
