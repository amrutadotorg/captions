1
00:00:08,417 --> 00:00:12,680
Today is a great day to come to Brighton,

2
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:18,721
because it’s the day of Buddha’s birthday.

3
00:00:19,021 --> 00:00:22,521
Today is Buddha's birthday, Lord Buddha's birthday.

4
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:29,251
We all have heard about His birth

5
00:00:31,209 --> 00:00:35,084
and that His mother dreamt of an elephant,

6
00:00:35,292 --> 00:00:41,709
of a large white elephant before the birth of Buddha.

7
00:00:44,209 --> 00:00:47,584
And then it was predicted

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,875
that a child will be born in your family

9
00:00:52,501 --> 00:00:57,501
who will be either a great saint

10
00:00:58,251 --> 00:01:01,875
or a very great King,

11
00:01:02,084 --> 00:01:05,875
as in Sanskrit called ‘chakravarti' - means the one who

12
00:01:06,292 --> 00:01:10,459
is the ruler of the whole world.

13
00:01:13,292 --> 00:01:15,917
So the father got worried,

14
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:23,959
and he thought he must get the son involved into the family life,

15
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:26,459
into material life

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,459
and give Him all the pleasures of life.

17
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:36,209
So he built a very special place for Him,

18
00:01:36,417 --> 00:01:39,125
a beautiful palace to live in.

19
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:48,084
And where he got Him married to a girl called Yashodhara,

20
00:01:48,584 --> 00:01:50,709
was a very, very beautiful woman,

21
00:01:51,334 --> 00:01:53,668
gave Him all the pleasures of life,

22
00:01:53,875 --> 00:02:01,668
everything that he could do to entice this boy away from asceticism.

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,709
Also you know the story of His going

24
00:02:08,917 --> 00:02:15,417
one day on the road, how He found three types of people,

25
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:21,917
and how He felt that ‘Why a person should become old?'

26
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:25,709
‘Why should a person suffer in life?

27
00:02:26,167 --> 00:02:29,251
and ‘Why should people die?’.

28
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:37,292
So all these three things put an enquiry into Himself

29
00:02:37,626 --> 00:02:41,334
and He started trying to understand

30
00:02:41,542 --> 00:02:44,709
why these things happen to human beings.

31
00:02:44,917 --> 00:02:47,292
With this the enquiry started.

32
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:53,917
So He reached a point where

33
00:02:54,125 --> 00:03:01,251
He could not bear any more the comforts and the, all the attachments

34
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:04,584
that were entangled around him by His father.

35
00:03:05,292 --> 00:03:08,334
He had a son whose name was Rahul;

36
00:03:08,542 --> 00:03:16,251
and He left the son and the wife in the search of the truth.

37
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:24,292
Now, He started from a wrong end, I should say,

38
00:03:24,501 --> 00:03:27,626
for the search of the truth because

39
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:32,042
He wanted to know, why there are miseries in the human beings.

40
00:03:32,251 --> 00:03:39,709
And so He started from collective towards the center.

41
00:03:40,042 --> 00:03:42,334
When we see miseries all around us,

42
00:03:42,542 --> 00:03:45,209
many people I have seen, they say: “What about others?

43
00:03:45,417 --> 00:03:47,251
Will everybody get realization?

44
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:49,501
Will everybody will have this, you see?

45
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:55,000
This comes from the wrong end I feel because

46
00:03:55,292 --> 00:04:00,334
first of all we must know, are we all right?

47
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:05,709
Have we - are we perfect?

48
00:04:05,917 --> 00:04:08,750
Are we full of joy?

49
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,709
Have we received the absolute knowledge?

50
00:04:14,917 --> 00:04:19,542
If you start from this point, it’s always better.

51
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:22,833
Because He started from the wrong point,

52
00:04:23,042 --> 00:04:25,875
searching it from the collective

53
00:04:26,084 --> 00:04:28,417
to remove the miseries of the people

54
00:04:28,626 --> 00:04:31,875
He had to go in a very round about way.

55
00:04:32,417 --> 00:04:36,542
So He read all the books and Vedas and this,

56
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:39,542
He went to big pundits,

57
00:04:39,709 --> 00:04:46,417
to all the great knowledgeable people to meet them,

58
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:53,209
to ask them the answer, “Why there are these three things?”

59
00:04:53,709 --> 00:05:00,709
that is the ‘roga’, is the

60
00:05:02,709 --> 00:05:07,833
health or miserable physical body,

61
00:05:08,376 --> 00:05:13,542
then the death and the old age.

62
00:05:14,709 --> 00:05:17,501
He went and asked so many people

63
00:05:17,709 --> 00:05:21,792
And they said: “You have to die because your are born."

64
00:05:22,292 --> 00:05:25,584
And then they said that you have to

65
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:30,875
become old because you are born like that

66
00:05:31,334 --> 00:05:33,626
and you have to suffer

67
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:36,084
because you commit sins.

68
00:05:36,292 --> 00:05:39,209
He was not satisfied with this answer.

69
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:44,292
So He went on searching and searching and searching.

70
00:05:44,626 --> 00:05:48,209
Then He got tired, absolutely fed up.

71
00:05:48,417 --> 00:05:54,542
Then He went to a place called Gaya, very near

72
00:05:54,709 --> 00:05:58,792
Patna it is, I've seen the place and the tree.

73
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:07,125
And He sat under a banyan tree where He slept off,

74
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:11,209
because He got so tired of His seeking.

75
00:06:11,417 --> 00:06:14,459
And after the sleep He got up

76
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:18,542
and suddenly He got His Realization.

77
00:06:18,709 --> 00:06:23,209
And He thought the whole drama is over.

78
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:28,459
Now His Mother Herself was Adishakti, who gave Him the birth

79
00:06:28,668 --> 00:06:31,417
and She died just after the birth of the child.

80
00:06:31,626 --> 00:06:36,792
And He got His Realization.

81
00:06:37,167 --> 00:06:41,209
Now at that time when He got His Realization

82
00:06:41,417 --> 00:06:45,376
there was nobody to tell Him what it is,

83
00:06:45,584 --> 00:06:49,376
that what it means Realization is.

84
00:06:49,584 --> 00:06:50,750
Nobody to decode

85
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:56,875
or talk about anything that was to be understood by Him.

86
00:06:57,167 --> 00:07:01,209
But because of His tremendous seeking

87
00:07:01,417 --> 00:07:05,959
and such ardent desire

88
00:07:06,376 --> 00:07:12,376
that the shuddha iccha, the Kundalini itself rose,

89
00:07:12,584 --> 00:07:14,626
but of course the Adishakti blessed Him

90
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:18,833
and He got His Realization under the banyan tree.

91
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:25,626
Now any incarnation, which came on this Earth

92
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:31,584
had to 'samayachara' - according to the time,

93
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:36,042
the need of the time had to act firstly,

94
00:07:36,292 --> 00:07:43,000
secondly the need of the

95
00:07:43,251 --> 00:07:45,875
incarnation to come on this earth

96
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:50,501
was first created in the human beings.

97
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:55,668
So supposing at a time when there was too much of ritualism,

98
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:59,750
Brahmanism or priesthood

99
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:04,584
and people were trying to take everything

100
00:08:04,792 --> 00:08:09,750
onto those artificial rituals and all that,

101
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:17,125
an incarnation had to come on this earth to correct those ideas.

102
00:08:17,334 --> 00:08:21,626
Like Krishna came at a time when He said, “This is all leela",

103
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,833
the puja and everything He canceled.

104
00:08:24,042 --> 00:08:26,334
Nothing doing, no puja nothing,

105
00:08:26,584 --> 00:08:30,000
you just have raas, enjoy yourself.

106
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:32,251
It's all a joke going on, you see.

107
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:38,167
So He brought that concept at that time in the awareness of people

108
00:08:38,376 --> 00:08:41,125
that the whole world is a leela,

109
00:08:41,334 --> 00:08:45,750
is a play of God's own whims.

110
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:47,709
So you just enjoy it.

111
00:08:48,417 --> 00:08:54,709
And that's how He created this wonderful festival of Holi,

112
00:08:54,917 --> 00:08:56,626
which we had

113
00:08:56,833 --> 00:09:01,209
in Delhi. I don’t know- anyone of you was there for the Holi? No.

114
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:02,167
You were there?

115
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,501
Sahaja Yogi: Two years back.

116
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:07,084
Shri Mataji: No, but this time you were not there.All right.

117
00:09:07,292 --> 00:09:10,584
You might get the pictures of that. All right.

118
00:09:10,792 --> 00:09:14,501
So in the same way when Buddha came in

119
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:17,584
first problem was that

120
00:09:17,792 --> 00:09:21,917
He thought that it's better not to talk about God.

121
00:09:22,251 --> 00:09:25,501
Because in His search everybody told Him

122
00:09:25,709 --> 00:09:29,584
the answer was, “Oh it’s God who does it.

123
00:09:29,792 --> 00:09:34,042
He punishes you. It’s God who gives you this old age.

124
00:09:34,251 --> 00:09:36,750
It’s God who does it.“ But what is this God after all?

125
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,042
Why does He do it?” They said, “You better ask the God."

126
00:09:39,251 --> 00:09:42,042
“Where is the God?”

127
00:09:42,251 --> 00:09:46,833
So everybody put every blame on God, as usual.

128
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:51,084
Even that’s done today, nothing so, so new

129
00:09:51,334 --> 00:09:54,542
and nothing unusual I should say.

130
00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:57,959
So this must be done by God, you see.

131
00:09:58,167 --> 00:09:59,501
If you cut your throat:

132
00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:04,750
‘God put my knife in my hand and He cut my throat’.

133
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:09,125
So you see, He thought better not talk of God.

134
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:12,459
Because everybody is going towards God.

135
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:15,292
Then the people whom He met they said,

136
00:10:15,501 --> 00:10:18,042
“Now I have become God.” He said, “How?”

137
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:20,792
He said: "I am God now.” “For what? Why?”

138
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,959
Because he could mesmerize people,

139
00:10:23,167 --> 00:10:27,125
he said: “I have become God.” Just imagine!

140
00:10:27,334 --> 00:10:30,709
So He thought that it’s very dangerous to talk of God

141
00:10:30,917 --> 00:10:33,959
because people take God in the hand and use it

142
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:35,709
for their own purpose,

143
00:10:35,917 --> 00:10:40,376
always say, “Oh this is what the God has to do

144
00:10:40,584 --> 00:10:42,125
and it’s God has

145
00:10:42,334 --> 00:10:44,750
done it and I’m in connection with God and I’ll tell God.”

146
00:10:45,167 --> 00:10:48,875
So He got a fright and He said that, “Better not talk about God.

147
00:10:49,084 --> 00:10:52,626
Because that puts the attention of the people on ritualism,

148
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:56,417
artificial things, they are building temples after temples,

149
00:10:56,626 --> 00:10:59,000
and just doing all these horrible things

150
00:10:59,334 --> 00:11:05,125
which one should not do. Like if you go to the south you’ll find

151
00:11:05,334 --> 00:11:08,917
in the temples they shave their heads of the ladies,

152
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,501
they shave it completely.

153
00:11:11,709 --> 00:11:13,376
And they have to -

154
00:11:13,584 --> 00:11:17,167
it’s all cobbled along the sides of the wall,

155
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:19,792
some walls of the temple.

156
00:11:20,084 --> 00:11:22,792
And the ladies who shaved their heads

157
00:11:23,084 --> 00:11:26,334
are just rolling along the sides, you see.

158
00:11:26,455 --> 00:11:30,830
They have to do sometimes 1008 times, rolling - imagine,

159
00:11:31,251 --> 00:11:33,584
and the water is poured on them.

160
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:37,251
God knows what is the ritual, from where it has come!

161
00:11:37,542 --> 00:11:40,542
So the poor women go on rolling, rolling, rolling like that

162
00:11:40,709 --> 00:11:43,084
and somebody is pouring water on them all the time,

163
00:11:43,292 --> 00:11:44,626
buckets after buckets.

164
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:48,334
Her husband and her brother and all they’re doing one after another,

165
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:49,917
you see one is finished then another one.

166
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:51,833
Poor ladies rolling like that,

167
00:11:52,042 --> 00:11:57,709
on that muddy sort of a cobbled area.

168
00:11:58,167 --> 00:12:00,792
I mean, I was shocked when I saw this.  I said: “What’s this?”

169
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,251
And then later on you see they became modern,

170
00:12:04,542 --> 00:12:08,376
so they started selling the hair, you see, abroad,

171
00:12:08,584 --> 00:12:12,501
so the whole thing became a big industry in Madras, you see,

172
00:12:12,709 --> 00:12:17,042
the hair was made into this bouffant and all they call it, here,

173
00:12:17,251 --> 00:12:21,125
and they sent it to England and other places.

174
00:12:21,376 --> 00:12:26,251
So it’s, I mean, in the name of God ridiculous things were done,

175
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:28,750
ridiculous things were done!

176
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,959
So He just thought: Better not talk about God.

177
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,376
The first step is Self-Realization.

178
00:12:34,668 --> 00:12:36,750
He was a great Sahaja Yogi I must say.

179
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,709
Because He said nothing doing, don't talk about God or anything,

180
00:12:39,917 --> 00:12:42,459
first you get your Realization.

181
00:12:42,668 --> 00:12:46,084
That was the first condition, establish it.

182
00:12:46,292 --> 00:12:49,376
Unless and until you have established your Realization,

183
00:12:49,584 --> 00:12:50,542
- nothing doing.

184
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:58,167
So He just started His own method of propagating Buddhi

185
00:12:58,417 --> 00:13:01,501
Buddha's knowledge or you can Buddhism you can say as they call it.

186
00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:03,584
Of course it became ‘ism’ later on.

187
00:13:03,792 --> 00:13:06,084
So all that He started

188
00:13:06,292 --> 00:13:10,542
with the idea that people should first become Buddha.

189
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:15,251
Buddha means realized, Buddha is ‘to know’.

190
00:13:15,542 --> 00:13:19,000
So "Buddha" means the person who has known,

191
00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:22,334
means the one who is a Realized soul.

192
00:13:22,584 --> 00:13:26,376
So what He says, “Buddham Sharanam Gachhami”,

193
00:13:26,584 --> 00:13:29,750
I bow, no I surrender – ‘sharanam’ means surrender,

194
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,292
I surrender to the Buddhas - means to all the Sahaja Yogis.
