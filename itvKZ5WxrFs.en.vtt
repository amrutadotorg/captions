00:00:00.352 --> 00:00:05.122
TV Host: Well, apparently meditating for, as
little as, 10 minutes a day, can significantly

00:00:05.122 --> 00:00:11.126
improve your mental health. A World for
Study has proven just how and why it works.

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.149
Reporter: Meditation has traditionally
been associated with Eastern mysticism.

00:00:17.149 --> 00:00:20.500
Dr. Hegarty: A lot of the time it has
been seen as, previously, is a little bit

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.280
light and fluffy but that's what's so
important about studies like this.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.255
Reporter: An Australian Quality of Life
Survey hopes to challenge these dues.

00:00:29.255 --> 00:00:33.963
Dr. Ramesh Manocha: Long term meditators
are physically and mentally more healthy

00:00:33.963 --> 00:00:38.744
than the general Australian population. It
appears to give them a particular effect.

00:00:38.744 --> 00:00:42.641
Reporter: People, who've meditated
regularly for at least two years are more

00:00:42.641 --> 00:00:48.472
than 10% better off than non-meditators
and those, who didn't drink or smoke had

00:00:48.472 --> 00:00:54.110
even better mental health. Rob Hutchin
has been meditating for more than 20 years.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.066
TV Host: So, how has meditation
changed your life?

00:00:57.066 --> 00:01:01.044
Rob Hutchin: I have to say how heartedly
or probably I wouldn't be alive, if I didn't

00:01:01.044 --> 00:01:09.674
start meditating because risk taking, highly
adventurous, on the treadmill, you know,

00:01:09.674 --> 00:01:11.661
Reporter: Destruction
Rob Hutchin: Absolutely

00:01:11.661 --> 00:01:15.781
Reporter: Meditation is often thought of as
something done in isolation and close to

00:01:15.781 --> 00:01:20.578
Nature, just like this, with meditating on
the go can be just as effective.

00:01:20.578 --> 00:01:24.273
Rob Hutchin: I've meditated in buses in
India, I've meditated on trains.

00:01:24.273 --> 00:01:27.198
One time, I taught a lady how to
meditate in the bus.

00:01:27.198 --> 00:01:30.744
Dr. Ramesh Manocha: We think we can't
allocate 5 -10 minutes a day but, in fact,

00:01:30.744 --> 00:01:36.336
we spend 5 -10 minutes a day watching TV
commercials and of wasting our time on Facebook.
