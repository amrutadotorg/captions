00:00:07.703 --> 00:00:11.121
So the first stage is of Shri Ganesha –

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:18.619
how He surrenders to the Shakti, to the Mother –

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.454
that is the beginning. If one cannot surrender…

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.037
That doesn’t mean you don’t do anything,

00:00:29.246 --> 00:00:32.204
but surrendering means the worship,

00:00:45.037 --> 00:00:47.412
the respect of the higher,

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:54.496
the obedience to the higher.

00:00:58.246 --> 00:01:00.371
Not to argue it out,

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.745
not to react, acceptance,

00:01:10.037 --> 00:01:15.496
absorption. Like a child absorbs the milk of the mother

00:01:20.287 --> 00:01:23.745
without questioning, without reasoning.

00:01:24.995 --> 00:01:28.579
That’s why Christ has said, “You have to become like children”.

00:01:32.121 --> 00:01:36.412
But if you are questioning, then you are no more a child.

00:01:38.412 --> 00:01:40.162
So first is the state,

00:01:40.371 --> 00:01:43.703
which you have to develop, is the child-like state.

00:01:47.287 --> 00:01:52.329
But child, which is a realised child, which has to have a gravity.

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:02.912
If you can develop childhood first,

00:02:03.204 --> 00:02:06.496
then everything takes proper course,

00:02:16.787 --> 00:02:19.619
because maturity cannot take place unless

00:02:19.787 --> 00:02:22.496
and until you start from the very beginning,

00:02:30.287 --> 00:02:34.204
and gravity means maturity not frivolousness.

00:02:40.121 --> 00:02:42.579
So now the quality of Ganesha, as you know,

00:02:42.787 --> 00:02:46.079
is that He has viveka, means He has discretion.

00:02:52.037 --> 00:02:55.496
He ‘has’ means He is discretion.

00:02:58.703 --> 00:03:02.496
So try to develop your discretion power

00:03:07.703 --> 00:03:16.204
so that Shri Ganesha gives you the wisdom – subuddhi – wisdom.

00:03:20.995 --> 00:03:25.703
And this is why you have to have a dependence on Shri Ganesha.

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:36.579
So at this point you have to make a negation of efforts.

00:03:40.496 --> 00:03:46.954
Like, whatever are efforts anti-Ganesha,

00:03:47.287 --> 00:03:51.619
or anti-innocence must be negated.

00:03:59.162 --> 00:04:06.995
So the negation of effort

00:04:07.412 --> 00:04:13.412
is to be achieved by negating whatever is the effort –

00:04:18.912 --> 00:04:22.619
means the effort of negation.

00:04:27.079 --> 00:04:29.995
So in the beginning you will not be effortless,

00:04:37.995 --> 00:04:41.454
you will have to put in effort for that.

00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:50.538
Like Christ has said, “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes”.

00:05:01.329 --> 00:05:04.496
So how do you make your eyes innocent?

00:05:07.829 --> 00:05:14.620
In Sahaja Yoga we have a method by which we try to distract our eyes

00:05:14.995 --> 00:05:21.121
from effort that makes it adulterous.

00:05:32.745 --> 00:05:35.454
Like, we try to put our attention, our eyes,

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.412
on the Mother Earth, on the grass, on the trees.

00:05:45.162 --> 00:05:51.246
So the avoidance, the avoiding of the effort itself is effort.

00:05:59.787 --> 00:06:02.620
So those people who have come now,

00:06:04.079 --> 00:06:07.620
recently, have to understand also that they have to put in

00:06:07.829 --> 00:06:11.246
all kinds of efforts to stop the efforts.

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.995
For example, some people are used to very comfortable life,

00:06:28.162 --> 00:06:30.703
they may talk of all kinds of renunciation,

00:06:30.912 --> 00:06:33.954
when it comes to comfort, they want to have comfort.

00:06:41.662 --> 00:06:47.121
Such people should try to get out of the habit of comfort –

00:06:47.329 --> 00:06:50.538
Sleep on the ground, sleep on the Mother Earth.

00:07:10.954 --> 00:07:13.037
Some people have an attention

00:07:13.246 --> 00:07:15.664
which is all the time looking this side, that side –

00:07:15.745 --> 00:07:18.679
cannot see to one point – so fix your attention.

00:07:31.538 --> 00:07:36.538
So gradually, you will find, you’ll discipline yourself.

00:07:42.954 --> 00:07:45.995
So the effort that you put in

00:07:46.558 --> 00:07:50.849
is very important in the beginning of Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:00.459 --> 00:08:08.376
I request you now that please do not waste My efforts.

00:08:12.579 --> 00:08:16.453
Look at yourself, help yourself

00:08:18.245 --> 00:08:24.245
and try to rise higher and higher to become your Self.

00:08:28.495 --> 00:08:32.026
When you become your Self, then you become the Guru.

00:08:36.826 --> 00:08:40.619
I hope Shri Ganesha will give you the wisdom

00:08:43.803 --> 00:08:45.216
to understand.

00:08:47.361 --> 00:08:52.478
The Shakti will give you shakti to work hard,

00:08:56.543 --> 00:09:01.918
and Shiva will give you joy, Sadashiva will give you the joy

00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:07.405
so that you proceed in your establishment.

00:09:16.118 --> 00:09:18.835
May God bless you.
