00:07.703 --> 00:11.121
So the first stage is of Shri Ganesha –

00:14.579 --> 00:18.619
how He surrenders to the Shakti, to the Mother –

00:23.619 --> 00:26.454
that is the beginning. If one cannot surrender…

00:26.620 --> 00:29.037
That doesn’t mean you don’t do anything,

00:29.246 --> 00:32.204
but surrendering means the worship,

00:45.037 --> 00:47.412
the respect of the higher,

00:51.619 --> 00:54.496
the obedience to the higher.

00:58.246 --> 01:00.371
Not to argue it out,

01:03.579 --> 01:07.745
not to react, acceptance,

01:10.037 --> 01:15.496
absorption. Like a child absorbs the milk of the mother

01:20.287 --> 01:23.745
without questioning, without reasoning.

01:24.995 --> 01:28.579
That’s why Christ has said, “You have to become like children”.

01:32.121 --> 01:36.412
But if you are questioning, then you are no more a child.

01:38.412 --> 01:40.162
So first is the state,

01:40.371 --> 01:43.703
which you have to develop, is the child-like state.

01:47.287 --> 01:52.329
But child, which is a realised child, which has to have a gravity.

01:56.579 --> 02:02.912
If you can develop childhood first,

02:03.204 --> 02:06.496
then everything takes proper course,

02:16.787 --> 02:19.619
because maturity cannot take place unless

02:19.787 --> 02:22.496
and until you start from the very beginning,

02:30.287 --> 02:34.204
and gravity means maturity not frivolousness.

02:40.121 --> 02:42.579
So now the quality of Ganesha, as you know,

02:42.787 --> 02:46.079
is that He has viveka, means He has discretion.

02:52.037 --> 02:55.496
He ‘has’ means He is discretion.

02:58.703 --> 03:02.496
So try to develop your discretion power

03:07.703 --> 03:16.204
so that Shri Ganesha gives you the wisdom – subuddhi – wisdom.

03:20.995 --> 03:25.703
And this is why you have to have a dependence on Shri Ganesha.

03:30.619 --> 03:36.579
So at this point you have to make a negation of efforts.

03:40.496 --> 03:46.954
Like, whatever are efforts anti-Ganesha,

03:47.287 --> 03:51.619
or anti-innocence must be negated.

03:59.162 --> 04:06.995
So the negation of effort

04:07.412 --> 04:13.412
is to be achieved by negating whatever is the effort –

04:18.912 --> 04:22.619
means the effort of negation.

04:27.079 --> 04:29.995
So in the beginning you will not be effortless,

04:37.995 --> 04:41.454
you will have to put in effort for that.

04:46.703 --> 04:50.538
Like Christ has said, “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes”.

05:01.329 --> 05:04.496
So how do you make your eyes innocent?

05:07.829 --> 05:14.620
In Sahaja Yoga we have a method by which we try to distract our eyes

05:14.995 --> 05:21.121
from effort that makes it adulterous.

05:32.745 --> 05:35.454
Like, we try to put our attention, our eyes,

05:35.620 --> 05:39.412
on the Mother Earth, on the grass, on the trees.

05:45.162 --> 05:51.246
So the avoidance, the avoiding of the effort itself is effort.

05:59.787 --> 06:02.620
So those people who have come now,

06:04.079 --> 06:07.620
recently, have to understand also that they have to put in

06:07.829 --> 06:11.246
all kinds of efforts to stop the efforts.

06:23.870 --> 06:27.995
For example, some people are used to very comfortable life,

06:28.162 --> 06:30.703
they may talk of all kinds of renunciation,

06:30.912 --> 06:33.954
when it comes to comfort, they want to have comfort.

06:41.662 --> 06:47.121
Such people should try to get out of the habit of comfort –

06:47.329 --> 06:50.538
Sleep on the ground, sleep on the Mother Earth.

07:10.954 --> 07:13.037
Some people have an attention

07:13.246 --> 07:15.664
which is all the time looking this side, that side –

07:15.745 --> 07:18.679
cannot see to one point – so fix your attention.

07:31.538 --> 07:36.538
So gradually, you will find, you’ll discipline yourself.

07:42.954 --> 07:45.995
So the effort that you put in

07:46.558 --> 07:50.849
is very important in the beginning of Sahaja Yoga.

08:00.459 --> 08:08.376
I request you now that please do not waste My efforts.

08:12.579 --> 08:16.453
Look at yourself, help yourself

08:18.245 --> 08:24.245
and try to rise higher and higher to become your Self.

08:28.495 --> 08:32.026
When you become your Self, then you become the Guru.

08:36.826 --> 08:40.619
I hope Shri Ganesha will give you the wisdom

08:43.803 --> 08:45.216
to understand.

08:47.361 --> 08:52.478
The Shakti will give you shakti to work hard,

08:56.543 --> 09:01.918
and Shiva will give you joy, Sadashiva will give you the joy

09:02.530 --> 09:07.405
so that you proceed in your establishment.

09:16.118 --> 09:18.835
May God bless you.
