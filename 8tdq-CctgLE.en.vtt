00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:11.944
Today we are going to have Shri Krishna Puja.

00:00:15.024 --> 00:00:25.241
It is a very important thing about the power of Shri Krishna

00:00:25.321 --> 00:00:30.510
that gives you a witness state.

00:00:34.064 --> 00:00:39.201
This is very important also because,

00:00:39.281 --> 00:00:52.080
in these days of Kali Yuga and
complete confusion of value system,

00:00:52.160 --> 00:01:04.661
all kinds of turmoil makes a
very complex conditions to exist.

00:01:09.941 --> 00:01:20.842
The state of witnessing is only possible through meditation:

00:01:20.922 --> 00:01:25.492
you reach the state of thoughtless awareness.

00:01:25.572 --> 00:01:29.306
It’s combined together.

00:01:29.386 --> 00:01:37.710
Now the witness state is such a
state where you just do not react.

00:01:40.897 --> 00:01:46.729
If you react, then the problem starts.

00:01:51.013 --> 00:01:55.596
It’s a very simple thing to understand

00:01:55.676 --> 00:02:05.120
that we react through our ego or through our conditioning.

00:02:06.705 --> 00:02:15.075
Otherwise there is no way to react.

00:02:15.155 --> 00:02:23.579
But witness state is not a mental
state, it is a state of a spiritual ascent

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:27.449
where you become a witness.

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:36.417
Best way to practice witness state is
not to criticize anyone, not to criticize.

00:02:36.497 --> 00:02:41.044
I’ve seen people who are all the time criticizing others.

00:02:41.124 --> 00:02:44.860
They cannot criticize themselves,
so they start criticizing other.

00:02:45.486 --> 00:02:50.122
So much so that they don’t even see what’s wrong with them.

00:02:50.202 --> 00:02:54.017
They don’t even see what wrong they have done to others,

00:02:54.097 --> 00:02:57.816
because they think they have a right to criticize others,

00:02:57.896 --> 00:03:01.724
and they enjoy this criticism very well.

00:03:01.804 --> 00:03:05.733
Actually there’s nothing to be criticized.

00:03:05.813 --> 00:03:09.336
You just watch and see for yourself.

00:03:09.416 --> 00:03:11.365
That’s all is your right.

00:03:11.445 --> 00:03:16.021
You have no right to criticize anyone or anything.

00:03:16.101 --> 00:03:18.965
But some people think if you do not criticize,

00:03:19.045 --> 00:03:24.004
then it will go on like this and
it will never stop. It’s not that!

00:03:24.084 --> 00:03:29.373
Once you watch the thing yourself, only just watch.

00:03:29.453 --> 00:03:35.796
Your attention itself is enlightened
now, with that enlightened attention

00:03:35.876 --> 00:03:41.621
you can just watch and stop the nonsense that is there.

00:03:41.701 --> 00:03:45.850
But we are always conscious that we are something great,

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.290
and we have to do this and we have to do that.

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:58.672
Under these circumstances what
happens is that you become another problem.

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.662
Because what can you do?

00:04:02.742 --> 00:04:05.194
You can’t do anything.

00:04:05.274 --> 00:04:09.542
But what you can do is to watch.

00:04:09.622 --> 00:04:15.507
By watching and by just seeing things as they are,

00:04:15.587 --> 00:04:21.690
you really develop a very different state of being.

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:28.061
Firstly all such people who are just witnessing,

00:04:30.448 --> 00:04:33.319
what happens to them is very interesting,

00:04:33.399 --> 00:04:36.476
that their memory loss is much less,

00:04:36.556 --> 00:04:40.494
because whatever they see becomes like a picture to them.

00:04:40.574 --> 00:04:46.420
Like you can say, they can tell you
even the color, the folding, everything.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.281
Whatever they see is so much in their mind like a photo,

00:04:51.361 --> 00:05:01.876
and they can tell you exactly what they
have seen, and your memory is not lost.

00:05:01.956 --> 00:05:09.499
While if you react onto everything,
your memory becomes horrible.

00:05:09.579 --> 00:05:14.043
And people are so much habituated with reacting.

00:05:14.123 --> 00:05:20.982
It can be very, very dangerous, because
once you start losing your witness state

00:05:21.062 --> 00:05:26.451
you can fall into negative collectivity.

00:05:26.531 --> 00:05:29.853
And thus this negative collectivity acts,

00:05:29.933 --> 00:05:34.846
acts in such a bad manner
that all the conflicts of the world,

00:05:34.926 --> 00:05:40.836
all the problems of the world perhaps are related with this.

00:05:40.916 --> 00:05:44.574
So as Sahaja Yogis, what should we do?

00:05:53.248 --> 00:06:00.606
We should not react, we should not react.

00:06:02.388 --> 00:06:11.779
If you see something wrong, all right,
you meditate on that point, you meditate.

00:06:11.859 --> 00:06:20.581
If you find anything wrong
happening, all right, meditate on that.

00:06:20.661 --> 00:06:26.018
If somebody is unkind to you, at that moment do not react.

00:06:26.098 --> 00:06:33.590
Afterwards when that person is
quietened, you tell him or tell her.

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:39.004
So this power of witnessing you all should develop.

00:06:39.084 --> 00:06:47.442
Try to develop it that when you are reacting, stop reaction,

00:06:47.522 --> 00:06:52.124
stop reaction about everything.

00:06:52.204 --> 00:06:58.591
You will be amazed, you will find
yourself a very, very powerful person

00:06:58.671 --> 00:07:06.505
in the sense you’ll have no
ambitions, you’ll have no desires,

00:07:06.585 --> 00:07:11.183
you’ll have no special fondness or anything.

00:07:11.263 --> 00:07:15.100
But just you are witnessing the drama.

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:24.271
It’s very interesting to witness also, because
then you understand the humor behind everything,

00:07:24.351 --> 00:07:30.408
And when in the collective all
of you have that witness state,

00:07:30.488 --> 00:07:40.685
you can do wonders without doing anything,
without saying anything, without acting

00:07:40.765 --> 00:07:44.491
- only your presence itself can work it out.

00:07:44.571 --> 00:07:49.515
I don’t say that it will have
effect on everyone, no, can’t say;

00:07:49.595 --> 00:07:53.337
but most of the people.

00:07:53.424 --> 00:08:04.877
Any person who is in that state, he is
the one who brings peace, he brings joy.
