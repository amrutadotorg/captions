00:13.114 --> 00:20.290
The ancient land of India, the land once divided amongst 
waring kings and princes a land troubled over  

00:20.290 --> 00:26.590
centuries by the occupation of foreign powers 
until in the middle of the 20th century India  

00:26.590 --> 00:32.289
achieved independence and freedom from 
those who had ruled her for 300 years.

00:42.613 --> 00:46.131
Despite all their differences of language 
and religion

00:46.131 --> 00:50.409
Indians became united in their efforts to be rid of this foreign rule

00:50.409 --> 00:54.732
through the courage and determination of one man Mahatma Gandhi.

00:54.732 --> 01:00.111
Gandhi challenged the might of the British Empire not with guns but with non-violence

01:00.111 --> 01:07.388
with passive resistance and his unshakeable belief in a people's right to be their own masters.

01:07.388 --> 01:16.206
Another of India's great leaders at that time Bal Gangadhar Tilak proclaimed to a British Court on his arrest "freedom is my birthright".

01:16.664 --> 01:23.627
"freedom is my birthright"

01:23.627 --> 01:28.891
By 1942 the Indian people saw that their freedom was at last possible

01:28.891 --> 01:32.454
and their British rulers began to fear it.

01:38.400 --> 01:43.732
The slogan "quit India" was soon to be found all over the country.

01:43.732 --> 01:47.960
Five years later India achieved her birthright of freedom.

01:53.199 --> 01:57.260
One of the young leaders of this campaign 
for political freedom was a medical student  

01:57.260 --> 02:03.800
now known as Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi who has 
since that time dedicated her life to another  

02:03.800 --> 02:10.213
kind of freedom the freedom of the Spirit through 
self-realization and the practice of Sahaja Yoga.  

02:10.213 --> 02:14.923
It's your birthright as a human being to become 
the Spirit.

02:14.923 --> 02:30.810
That what Sahaja Yoga is. "Saha" means "with" and "ja" is "born". Born with you is the right to get this Yoga is the union with the Divine.

02:30.810 --> 02:41.337
Is your birthright as a human being you are as I told you at the epitome of evolution

02:41.337 --> 02:49.822
and it has to work out but please open your hearts 
and open your minds.

02:55.990 --> 03:02.990
For thousands of years India the great land of the Spirit awaited 
the fulfillment of its ancient prophecies  

03:03.890 --> 03:09.590
that the great incarnation of the primordial 
energy the Adi Shakti would bring a yoga  

03:09.590 --> 03:18.000
that would create an inner transformation and 
self mastery for all men

03:21.238 --> 03:32.121
This momentous event is also foreseen by many Indian poets including the great Rabindranath Tagore seen here with Gandhi.

03:33.850 --> 03:40.532
The unique experience of self-realization takes place when the primordial energy called Kundalini

03:40.532 --> 03:47.726
is correctly awakened by someone who has already experienced and mastered their own self-realization.

03:47.726 --> 03:52.736
Shri Mataji has explained that the Kundalini is the power of our spiritual ascent

03:52.736 --> 03:59.277
found in the triangular bone at the base of the spine called sacrum by the Greeks.

03:59.277 --> 04:02.692
It is the power of our pure desire.

04:05.505 --> 04:12.517
When awakened the Kundalini rises spontaneously through six subtle centers called chakras.

04:12.517 --> 04:17.442
The Kundalini then emerges through the fontanel bone area at the top of the head

04:17.442 --> 04:22.316
emitting a cool breeze that can be felt there as well as on the hands.

04:26.891 --> 04:35.056
In her desire to offer self-realization to mankind through Sahaja Yoga Shri Mataji constantly travelled the world.

04:37.189 --> 04:40.416
I am not here to take anything from you.

04:44.132 --> 04:49.940
Nor for a vote from you I am not a politician.

04:53.841 --> 05:00.520
I am here to give you the key of your own wealth. 

05:05.345 --> 05:08.713
There is big inner revolution that is coming up

05:11.423 --> 05:15.995
which is silent joyous

05:17.156 --> 05:22.317
and is going to change the whole humanity

05:28.413 --> 05:31.226
This was the dream of Lenin

05:34.271 --> 05:36.197
who was a realised soul himself

05:38.648 --> 05:42.906
that he wanted to have a stateless state.

05:46.194 --> 05:51.782
And realised people don't need any state.

05:57.949 --> 06:02.217
You are just there.

06:33.280 --> 06:43.364
So you see, we have to understand that life has to be enjoyable

06:44.474 --> 06:46.439
Hello. How are you?

07:02.720 --> 07:08.975
Those who have felt cool breeze in their hands

07:08.975 --> 07:14.419
or from their head please raise both your hands please.

07:18.367 --> 07:22.823
So many. May God bless you.

08:17.551 --> 08:27.553
Shri Mataji was born in 1923 in the very center of India near the town of Nagpur in the state of Maharashtra.

08:27.553 --> 08:34.307
Actually I was born like this. In a very enlightened family I should say.

08:35.236 --> 08:39.562
My father a very enlightened man and he was

08:39.562 --> 08:45.952
member of the Assembly, Central assembly, Member of the constitution.

08:45.952 --> 08:48.990
Constituent assembly Parliament.

08:48.990 --> 08:52.804
My mother was a honours of mathematics

08:52.804 --> 08:59.520
and my father was a scholar of [unclear - languages] also.

09:00.475 --> 09:03.131
It was her father who took her to see Gandhi.

09:03.131 --> 09:05.360
When Shri Mataji he was a young girl

09:05.360 --> 09:11.420
Gandhi recognized something unique in her and suggested that the child spend some time with him at the ashram

09:11.420 --> 09:16.253
where she became a frequent visitor over the years.

09:22.601 --> 09:27.524
Living abroad and traveling so much allowed Shri Mataji little time at a home in India

09:27.524 --> 09:29.752
but the travelling did not stop.

09:29.752 --> 09:36.701
She regularly toured this vast country reaching out to the people in the crowded cities as well as country villages.

09:42.559 --> 09:48.441
At the end of the 90s the crowds who came to her public programs numbered in their thousands

09:48.441 --> 09:55.570
but when Shri Mataji started teaching Sahaja Yoga in India back in 1970 it was only with a mere handful of people.

10:07.487 --> 10:10.894
With the initial 12 people who achieved their 
self-realization

10:10.894 --> 10:15.140
Shri Mataji was able to establish Sahaja Yoga in India.

10:16.869 --> 10:21.563
Then in 1973 Shri Mataji went to live in London.

10:24.453 --> 10:34.475
Her husband mr. now sir CP Srivastava had been elected secretary-general of the International Maritime Organization an agency of United Nations

10:34.475 --> 10:39.113
this brought Shri Mataji into the world of international diplomacy.

11:05.482 --> 11:10.160
But in the midst of her life as the wife of 
a diplomat then a mother of two children  

11:10.160 --> 11:15.902
and then a grandmother Shri Mataji has 
devoted all her efforts to giving self-realization

11:15.902 --> 11:20.810
and bringing Sahaja Yoga to very confused societies desperate for change.

11:38.642 --> 11:43.880
One of the effects of Kundalini awakening through 
Sahaja Yoga has been to help people with all  

11:43.880 --> 11:51.168
kinds of serious addictions such as drugs and 
alcohol and illnesses such as diabetes and cancer  

11:51.840 --> 11:57.420
impressive results have attracted the attention 
of the medical profession around the world.

11:58.762 --> 12:05.480
Dr. David Spiro is a general practitioner in London 
who has studied the application of Sahaja Yoga  

12:05.480 --> 12:11.450
as a form of treatment for several years and who 
has seen many cures for a variety of problems and  

12:11.450 --> 12:17.200
a marked increase in the general good health 
and well-being of people who practice Sahaja Yoga.

12:17.200 --> 12:23.075
I've been involved with Sahaja Yoga and the work of Shri Mataji for about the past 10 years.

12:23.075 --> 12:33.554
In India there's been some scientific studies which have shown the physiological effects of Sahaja Yoga as a form of meditation

12:33.554 --> 12:42.412
and some other studies on two particular illnesses asthma and hypertension which have shown very interesting results

12:42.902 --> 12:54.385
they've shown for example much larger drops in blood pressure than have ever been demonstrated before by any other form of relaxation or meditation.

12:54.385 --> 12:58.930
People around the world have been finding that the awakening of the Kundalini

12:58.930 --> 13:06.418
and the practice of Sahaja Yoga have 
helped to solve a wide variety of problems of all kinds.

13:06.779 --> 13:14.640
Now at the beginning of the 21st century Sahaja Yoga is being practiced in some 70 countries.

13:14.640 --> 13:19.023
They have all combined together integrated together so peaceful

13:19.023 --> 13:25.668
and they lost all these conditionings of their so-called man-made religions or

13:25.668 --> 13:31.830
their man-made boundaries of nations and man-made ideologist.

13:31.830 --> 13:34.509
It opens out with truth to everyone.

13:34.509 --> 13:39.641
The way there are so many political changes taking place

13:39.641 --> 13:43.460
so dramatically and so fast

13:43.460 --> 13:48.000
one should expect a very beautiful world.
