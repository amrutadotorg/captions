WEBVTT

01:46.492 --> 01:53.000
Everything in Sahaja Yoga is very scientific,

01:53.626 --> 01:57.626
is all pre-planned I think, and is all significant.

02:00.209 --> 02:03.584
For example, today is Wednesday

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
and we have never had any Puja on a Wednesday

02:08.000 --> 02:10.542
because I was born on Wednesday.

02:11.375 --> 02:15.259
So I was thinking if the Puja starts before twelve o’clock

02:15.459 --> 02:17.301
we’ll be able to manage it

02:17.501 --> 02:19.501
because I was born at twelve.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
So every child has to sleep after twelve o’clock, you see,

02:23.417 --> 02:28.259
and so I couldn’t, I had to sleep. So it’s so significant, you see.

02:28.459 --> 02:30.800
It’s the first time we are having a Puja on Wednesday,

02:31.000 --> 02:34.209
normally I don’t even travel on Wednesdays.

02:34.459 --> 02:40.092
So, you can imagine that it’s such a breakthrough and I’m very happy

02:40.292 --> 02:42.259
that you all are ready for a Puja

02:42.459 --> 02:47.967
and that we could break this rule also,

02:48.167 --> 02:51.301
after such a long time,

02:51.501 --> 02:57.800
because it was impossible for me to keep awake after twelve, you see

02:58.000 --> 02:59.426
I was trying, trying, trying

02:59.626 --> 03:03.042
and I knew that you all, also, were feeling very sleepy.

03:09.000 --> 03:14.000
So it’s so mutual and it’s so simple.Alright.

03:15.000 --> 03:20.417
So today we have gathered, really, remarkably,

03:22.334 --> 03:27.334
in the really centre of the Nabhi of the universe,

03:29.000 --> 03:30.800
and I don’t know how far

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
I can go with the description of this great country

03:35.375 --> 03:38.375
which we call as Greece.

03:40.000 --> 03:48.542
Also, in the Puranas it is described as Manipura Dweep.

03:49.000 --> 03:54.375
The Manipur is the Nabhi Chakra – Manipur,

03:55.000 --> 03:57.259
and a “dweep” is a island.

03:57.459 --> 04:02.384
Island of the Manipura stays the Athena,

04:02.584 --> 04:07.459
and there is a temple of Athena,

04:08.000 --> 04:14.334
all been described about Her temple, about Her

04:17.250 --> 04:20.250
jewelry, dress and everything.

04:21.083 --> 04:25.050
So it’s already in the Puranas described, this Athena.

04:25.250 --> 04:29.250
As I’ve told you before, ‘Athena’ means the Primordial Mother.

04:30.167 --> 04:33.259
So now, one may say that,

04:33.459 --> 04:35.709
“Why the Primordial Mother, Adi Shakti,

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
should be on the Nabhi Chakra of the universe?”

04:39.584 --> 04:41.800
One may ask a question like that,

04:42.000 --> 04:49.000
that, “Why She’s placed on the Nabhi Chakra?”

04:50.000 --> 04:56.000
Because in the – I don’t know in English –

04:58.417 --> 05:03.417
before the Creation was created in the material form,

05:04.375 --> 05:07.375
where it was planned,

05:10.000 --> 05:13.584
then there was something of the –

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
what we call is the Vishnuloka,

05:18.000 --> 05:25.501
is the loka, or the area where Vishnu ruled,

05:27.042 --> 05:32.417
and in that Vishnuloka it was decided

05:33.000 --> 05:42.083
that Adi Shakti should first come in the form as a cow,

05:42.667 --> 05:48.175
and then She should descend in the area called as Gokul,

05:48.375 --> 05:51.175
which is Vishuddhi Chakra,  first

05:51.375 --> 05:53.667
and create vibrations there.

05:54.417 --> 05:58.467
Now in the material form the Gokul was

05:58.667 --> 06:02.292
where Shri Krishna lived in His childhood.

06:04.334 --> 06:11.209
So in the material form, Athena itself lived –

06:12.167 --> 06:18.042
in the material form, I’m not saying in the formation before –

06:18.292 --> 06:22.709
in this area, to create the vibrations.

06:23.167 --> 06:25.626
So it is not only She was a Goddess

06:26.292 --> 06:28.584
but She lived in this area

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
to create the vibrations for the Nabhi,

06:32.584 --> 06:39.584
to create the universal

06:40.542 --> 06:45.384
compassion and love and all Her qualities.

06:45.584 --> 06:52.584
Now as you know, every aspect of the Goddess has different qualities

06:54.459 --> 07:01.459
and as you can see that Mahakali has the aspect of comforting,

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
and Mahasaraswati is counselling,

07:07.000 --> 07:11.626
and the Mahalakshmi has got

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
for the redemption, for the awakening.

07:15.584 --> 07:20.050
But the Adi Shakti’s work

07:20.250 --> 07:23.250
is to unite everything, to integrate everything;

07:25.542 --> 07:28.709
and to integrate all those qualities,

07:29.000 --> 07:33.800
the Adi Shakti Herself was…

07:34.000 --> 07:38.626
in material form, came on this earth, in this part,

07:39.209 --> 07:42.209
and that’s why they knew about Athena.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
But as it is,

07:46.042 --> 07:48.050
I don’t know what are the stories they have–

07:48.250 --> 07:51.092
they must be having some mythological stories about Athena

07:51.292 --> 07:54.292
that She lived like this or whatever it was.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.175
And this is the…

07:57.375 --> 07:59.584
where She created the Devaloka.

08:00.626 --> 08:05.000
Devaloka is the area where devas existed.

08:05.417 --> 08:08.000
Like She created Indra –

08:08.250 --> 08:11.175
you have heard the name of Indra – then Varuna;

08:11.375 --> 08:16.375
all these devalokas She created in this area, not in India.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
Devaloka was created on this side,

08:21.417 --> 08:25.009
and ganas and all these people were created

08:25.209 --> 08:29.667
on the side of Nepal and all those places, on the left-hand side.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
Now unfortunately after Socrates, who came here

08:40.334 --> 08:46.259
in such a condition when people were really,

08:46.459 --> 08:50.050
absolutely ignorant, in the complete darkness of ignorance,

08:50.250 --> 08:52.092
they could not understand Him,

08:52.292 --> 08:55.092
they could not understand Socrates at all

08:55.292 --> 09:00.259
and so like any other Primordial Master was treated

09:00.459 --> 09:04.459
by the people who were surrounding Him,

09:05.250 --> 09:09.050
He was also very much ill-treated and nobody listened to Him.

09:09.250 --> 09:12.301
But of course, as you know, He was Primordial Master

09:12.501 --> 09:17.000
and His wisdom is well-known and He created out of Him

09:17.209 --> 09:22.584
disciples, but none of them could go anywhere near His wisdom,

09:23.000 --> 09:25.800
and they started their own theories, own styles,

09:26.000 --> 09:28.800
and that’s how we find the accent from

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
philosophy that was Socrates’ aim,

09:33.417 --> 09:38.134
gradually came into political and then into economic side.

09:38.334 --> 09:42.175
So the attention was moved from philosophy

09:42.375 --> 09:45.175
to economics today,

09:45.375 --> 09:50.467
not towards the philosophy which was established by Socrates.

09:50.667 --> 09:55.217
We can say Socrates was the one Primordial Master,

09:55.417 --> 10:03.092
after Abraham and Moses, who really made it

10:03.292 --> 10:09.292
very clear-cut understanding about spirituality.

10:11.375 --> 10:15.175
Of course Moses and Mohammad…

10:15.375 --> 10:16.800
Abraham had different problems.

10:17.000 --> 10:21.883
Like Abraham had problems of talking to people

10:22.083 --> 10:24.584
who were  really very, very ignorant,

10:25.000 --> 10:29.417
and Moses had problem with people who were very indulgent people,

10:30.000 --> 10:34.050
so He had to pass laws of Shariat.

10:34.250 --> 10:35.800
Moses passed the law of Shariat,

10:36.000 --> 10:38.709
and if you read Bible, in the –

10:39.000 --> 10:43.417
I think – in the first verse only it is written about Shariat

10:43.626 --> 10:51.301
in the Jeremiah (Leviticus?), third book of Bible,

10:51.501 --> 10:56.092
that Moses had to pass these laws, different, different laws

10:56.292 --> 11:00.292
to make the people follow religion precisely.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.626
So He did not argue, He did not say

11:05.042 --> 11:08.301
why you should do it, didn’t give any explanation. “You do it!” Like that.

11:08.501 --> 11:11.342
Because He thought that these people are so ignorant

11:11.542 --> 11:15.125
that you cannot leave it to their freedom

11:15.417 --> 11:21.667
that you understand this or

11:22.250 --> 11:24.626
that you see the point;

11:25.000 --> 11:26.417
He could not do that way.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.626
So He just said, “Alright. These are the laws, these are the things

11:31.000 --> 11:34.009
and you have to follow. If you don’t follow then you will be killed,

11:34.209 --> 11:37.209
your hands will be cut, this will happen, that will happen.”

11:38.417 --> 11:41.417
Because the people were of that type.

11:42.250 --> 11:44.925
Now then you see how gradually,

11:45.125 --> 11:48.967
at the time of Socrates people had evolved,

11:49.167 --> 11:51.092
they were a much better people

11:51.292 --> 11:55.292
so He could talk to them about something

11:57.250 --> 12:02.050
of wisdom, of honesty, of righteousness, of peace.

12:02.250 --> 12:04.050
Of so many things He talked,

12:04.250 --> 12:07.417
and He could talk because people were worthy of that.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.800
Otherwise He could have said, “Alright.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
You do this, you do that, you do that.”

12:15.626 --> 12:19.626
But see the difference also in the circumstances how what has happened:

12:20.584 --> 12:24.584
in the first circumstances when Abraham had problems

12:25.000 --> 12:29.375
then the people were absolutely good-for-nothing,

12:30.000 --> 12:33.542
absolutely good for nothing, so He didn’t know what to do with them.

12:34.042 --> 12:38.667
So only, you can see it, in the time of Abraham that His own lifestyle…

12:39.042 --> 12:42.967
I mean, that was just a system when the family was building up

12:43.167 --> 12:45.626
and the relationships were building up,

12:46.000 --> 12:49.092
and He tried to work it on that level.

12:49.292 --> 12:54.292
Then at the time of Moses people evolved much more.

12:55.209 --> 12:59.000
They evolved but still very ignorant.

12:59.250 --> 13:01.342
So they evolved to this point

13:01.542 --> 13:05.217
that He did not have to talk the things that Abraham talked.

13:05.417 --> 13:10.584
So He talked to them about getting out of Egypt,

13:11.000 --> 13:14.134
taking their freedom, getting out from there

13:14.334 --> 13:22.000
and going to a place of more tranquillity.

13:23.542 --> 13:25.384
But when they did that,

13:25.584 --> 13:28.384
He found these people on the way –

13:28.584 --> 13:32.175
when He went to get the Ten Commandments,

13:32.375 --> 13:35.375
when He came back – what He finds…

13:59.167 --> 14:03.626
So the people who were at the time of Moses,

14:04.125 --> 14:09.334
when He had gone to get the Ten Commandments,

14:10.000 --> 14:14.217
started indulging into very, very immoral character,

14:14.417 --> 14:17.259
extremely immoral character.

14:17.459 --> 14:22.800
They were very immoral and were doing such horrible things that

14:23.000 --> 14:26.134
that nobody can believe that anybody

14:26.334 --> 14:29.009
who tried to escape from the Egyptians

14:29.209 --> 14:31.375
were worse than the Egyptians themselves.

14:32.334 --> 14:37.626
So He gave this Shariat to them, to change.

14:38.209 --> 14:46.209
Now then came the time when people were…

14:48.292 --> 14:52.925
I mean, despite all that people were not so good,

14:53.125 --> 14:55.125
we can say at the time of Christ,

14:56.000 --> 14:58.459
but they were not so immoral;

14:59.167 --> 15:01.626
they also could not understand Christ.

15:02.417 --> 15:07.217
So you see, despite all the human evolution,

15:07.417 --> 15:09.925
the human awareness evolving,

15:10.125 --> 15:16.209
the understanding about spirituality was very poor

15:16.667 --> 15:19.667
and you could not talk to them.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.417
Now you can also see the circumstances of things.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.626
When the circumstances are such,

15:29.334 --> 15:33.000
like at the time of, say Moses,

15:33.542 --> 15:36.342
that people are extremely immoral,

15:36.542 --> 15:39.542
they are doing all kinds of bad things,

15:41.000 --> 15:45.459
they are not bothered about their own destruction,

15:47.125 --> 15:52.125
the Incarnations had to move absolutely to the right

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
because they were so left-sided:

15:56.250 --> 16:00.009
So the Incarnations had to move absolutely to the right

16:00.209 --> 16:03.800
and say that, “If you do like this,

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
this We’ll have to do” the violence part.

16:07.375 --> 16:09.375
So they took to violence.

16:11.000 --> 16:17.000
So the circumstances made the reactions of the people,

16:18.042 --> 16:21.967
also the awareness of human beings.

16:22.167 --> 16:25.167
So many things worked it out.

16:26.125 --> 16:30.125
Say, for example, when Athena came on this earth,

16:30.459 --> 16:39.167
her job was to create a integrated force

16:42.501 --> 16:50.250
which will have the whole chaitanya spread like an integrated force.

16:50.584 --> 16:58.584
So that when it will be all disintegrated later on it can integrate.

17:00.042 --> 17:07.042
So the Greeks have a job, special job, is to integrate.

17:11.292 --> 17:14.292
You have to integrate people

17:16.125 --> 17:19.125
which are left-sided and right-sided.

17:21.292 --> 17:24.842
And that’s what I asked him, “What happened to Hitler?”

17:25.042 --> 17:27.800
So they said that when they saw Hitler,

17:28.000 --> 17:31.125
though Hitler respected them, they resisted Hitler.

17:33.000 --> 17:40.000
You can see the significance, how he respected the Greeks

17:41.042 --> 17:47.092
and despite that they resisted him

17:47.292 --> 17:50.292
because they were given this special capacity.

17:51.501 --> 17:54.301
Something with Greeks, they went to…

17:54.501 --> 17:57.501
I mean, except Alexander, only the one

17:58.375 --> 18:03.334
who tried to invade India,

18:04.167 --> 18:07.209
and because of the Greek nature he receded back.

18:08.375 --> 18:10.667
You see it’s a Greek nature

18:11.125 --> 18:14.375
that they can go so far and then not,

18:15.375 --> 18:18.375
because they have an integrating force.

18:18.667 --> 18:22.626
The same thing as I was asking him about what happened with the Turks.

18:23.417 --> 18:28.167
They had gone into Turkey but they receded back.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.459
So this power of receding back

18:33.292 --> 18:37.000
is the integrating power,

18:38.000 --> 18:39.925
by you integrate within yourself

18:40.125 --> 18:44.967
both the qualities of the left and right and you balance it,

18:45.167 --> 18:47.501
and you see now that’s alright.

18:48.501 --> 18:50.342
If you have to be in the centre

18:50.542 --> 18:53.542
we should go up to a point and come back.

18:54.459 --> 18:59.417
And this is a very basic quality of Greeks in every respect.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.967
If you take their shipping,

19:02.167 --> 19:05.384
they were very aggressive in shipping to begin with,

19:05.584 --> 19:07.709
extremely aggressive people,

19:08.000 --> 19:11.709
and Greek ships were known for not maintaining at all.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.800
They were not very law-abiding

19:14.000 --> 19:16.426
so they were never used to maintain their ships, you see,

19:16.626 --> 19:21.301
and always under trouble – the Greeks –

19:21.501 --> 19:26.925
that in the shipping they were known to be, the Greeks have

19:27.125 --> 19:32.167
ships which are all falling off and rattling.

19:33.501 --> 19:37.501
So perhaps, perhaps,

19:38.000 --> 19:41.501
they were aware that now the shipping is going to go down,

19:41.709 --> 19:44.709
so no use maintaining these ships, you see.

19:45.501 --> 19:48.925
Then when the shipping went down –

19:49.125 --> 19:52.584
you see this is on economic level I’m saying, how they worked it out

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
they sunk their ships

19:56.501 --> 20:00.501
and got the money out of insurance.

20:06.000 --> 20:10.883
That is a typical Greek style of behaviour

20:11.083 --> 20:16.250
is that they know already. It’s a kind of a wisdom,

20:16.542 --> 20:19.009
they know that how far to go.

20:19.209 --> 20:22.667
Like, we can see now, Onassis also married this mad woman,

20:23.292 --> 20:25.925
Kennedy’s wife, because  he must have realised

20:26.125 --> 20:29.967
that Kennedy never gave her any security so he married her.

20:30.167 --> 20:33.626
Alright. He married her up to a point,

20:34.000 --> 20:36.883
but most of his property went to his daughter,

20:37.083 --> 20:39.083
not to Mrs. Kennedy.

20:40.334 --> 20:46.384
This balance and this wisdom is a special Greek style of life;

20:46.584 --> 20:50.134
that’s why you might say that they are not over-developed

20:50.334 --> 20:52.050
like Americans are.

20:52.250 --> 20:55.342
But now Americans have realised that they are idiots,

20:55.542 --> 20:57.384
but Greeks can never become idiots,

20:57.584 --> 20:59.584
whatever you may try.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.626
They are very sharp and very intelligent

21:04.501 --> 21:07.501
but they know how far to go with everything.

21:08.542 --> 21:11.542
And what is the reason for this? The Athena.

21:12.584 --> 21:16.259
So Athena is the one, Adi Shakti,

21:16.459 --> 21:19.459
and She created Ganesha here.

21:20.292 --> 21:23.384
And the balance of the universe,

21:23.584 --> 21:27.259
or all the dharmas, is in the Nabhi Chakra,

21:27.459 --> 21:32.042
and so the people over here are very balanced.

21:33.334 --> 21:38.134
You can find them very…

21:38.334 --> 21:43.209
in their language, in their styles, very deep.

21:43.501 --> 21:46.342
One may say because they are traditional people,

21:46.542 --> 21:48.542
they have long traditions.

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
But Egypt had also long traditions.

21:52.626 --> 21:55.342
Of course Egyptians are, in a way,

21:55.542 --> 21:59.417
wiser than all other Islamic countries,

21:59.667 --> 22:04.667
but not like Greeks, not like Greeks.

22:06.250 --> 22:09.250
We have Chinese also who are very wise,

22:10.000 --> 22:16.000
and they are known to be people of deep understanding,

22:17.000 --> 22:19.334
but they are not like Indians.

22:21.292 --> 22:25.292
So what is lacking in all these people is

22:26.292 --> 22:30.292
the depth of awareness

22:31.209 --> 22:37.375
because, though in China also Mother of Mercy came

22:37.667 --> 22:44.626
and She really bestowed blessings upon them,

22:45.626 --> 22:51.301
and China rose also, afterwards,

22:51.501 --> 22:54.501
into her own glory

22:55.042 --> 23:00.542
and became quite a good industrial,

23:01.000 --> 23:04.417
I mean developed country, we can say, very powerful;

23:05.667 --> 23:11.092
but still, that kind of regimentation could not be borne

23:11.292 --> 23:14.042
because, after all, Mother Mercy was there.

23:14.542 --> 23:16.134
Do you know last…

23:16.334 --> 23:19.092
you have one Mother Mercy you have given me –

23:19.292 --> 23:23.092
Kuan Yin, same thing, Kuan Yin.

23:23.292 --> 23:25.883
And She’s the same thing called as Mother of Mercy –

23:26.083 --> 23:33.083
and the second one was given by Gregoire recently,

23:34.000 --> 23:36.542
and you see what’s happening in China.

23:38.417 --> 23:41.417
So the effects of these

23:46.000 --> 23:50.584
Deities which existed in different countries at different times

23:51.292 --> 23:55.292
are felt only in Kali Yuga in the best way.

23:56.209 --> 23:58.009
Now you may say that,

23:58.209 --> 24:02.209
“Why should Mother come last to Greece?”

24:03.501 --> 24:09.042
Because now Athena is in the Sahastrara,

24:09.292 --> 24:12.384
so you have to go not in the Nabhi.

24:12.584 --> 24:16.050
So I had to bring Sahastrara here, isn’t it?

24:16.250 --> 24:19.175
Sahastrara is the last chakra one has to achieve,

24:19.375 --> 24:24.334
so I thought that let Greeks

24:25.459 --> 24:29.167
grow up to the Sahastrara point.

24:30.250 --> 24:33.626
So we have to establish Sahastrara in Greece

24:34.000 --> 24:40.042
and thus it’s a very powerful work we have to do in Greece

24:41.417 --> 24:47.050
because actually, at the time

24:47.250 --> 24:49.259
when Athena came here,

24:49.459 --> 24:53.584
it was not Sahastrara, it was Nabhi,

24:54.334 --> 24:59.584
because She was actually on the Himalayas, came from Himalayas.

25:00.042 --> 25:02.626
So now to bring Himalaya here,

25:03.125 --> 25:08.000
or to bring that purity in Greece, is a tremendous task

25:09.292 --> 25:11.626
and we have very few sahaja yogis.

25:12.292 --> 25:15.584
But you see the reaction of the gentleman who came?

25:16.083 --> 25:22.800
And we have formidable job because of these Orthodox…

25:23.000 --> 25:25.209
most unorthodox,

25:26.334 --> 25:29.667
they have no orthodoxy about anything.

25:32.292 --> 25:37.000
So we have a problem, big problem,

25:37.584 --> 25:40.584
how we’ll establish here.

25:43.000 --> 25:47.217
The Devaloka was formed here

25:47.417 --> 25:51.417
and devas were here; they ruled here, no doubt;

25:52.000 --> 25:56.417
but in the human awareness they're brought down to the human level.

25:57.417 --> 26:02.217
Like Zeus was Parashurama, Parashurama –

26:02.417 --> 26:09.501
the one who was an Incarnation to announce the advent of Shri Rama,

26:10.000 --> 26:17.167
and He came before Shri Ram, died also very much before Shri Ram;

26:18.334 --> 26:24.334
but they painted Zeus as a man who was a womaniser.

26:27.000 --> 26:30.250
So all Gods were brought to the level of human beings,

26:30.501 --> 26:33.342
bestowed with all the weaknesses, you see,

26:33.542 --> 26:37.542
actually decorated with all the weaknesses.

26:38.542 --> 26:41.925
And that is responsible for the downfall

26:42.125 --> 26:46.167
because this part of the country

26:48.334 --> 26:53.334
is on the pattern of Devaloka,

26:54.584 --> 27:01.501
reflection of that, but this Devaloka is now,

27:02.167 --> 27:08.209
we see it has become just the opposite

27:09.250 --> 27:16.217
because Deities have been brought down to such a low level,

27:16.417 --> 27:19.375
to such degrading things.

27:20.125 --> 27:26.459
Even in the mythology also, in India

27:27.042 --> 27:32.542
talks about Them like this. Not to such an extent;

27:33.459 --> 27:39.209
like Zeus, they don’t talk but about Indra they talk.

27:40.000 --> 27:48.125
And like Indra’s description comes like this:

27:49.417 --> 27:56.301
that the king Hiranyakashipu’s wife was living…

27:56.501 --> 28:01.842
his wife… Hiranyakashipu’s wife was a saintly lady

28:02.042 --> 28:07.259
and Hiranyakashipu was ruling in the area of

28:07.459 --> 28:12.501
you can say Kandahar and Afghanistan and all these places,

28:13.000 --> 28:17.459
and from here Indra went down

28:18.501 --> 28:21.501
and took away the wife.

28:22.501 --> 28:26.501
I mean They incarnated, the Gods incarnated here,

28:27.542 --> 28:30.301
and Indra went down,

28:30.501 --> 28:34.301
He took away the wife of Hiranyakashipu with Him, to save Her,

28:34.501 --> 28:38.501
and He went down and stayed in an ashram in Maharashtra

28:40.000 --> 28:43.417
where there’s a river flowing with My name – Nira.

28:44.584 --> 28:47.967
So now the… see how the combinations are,

28:48.167 --> 28:55.301
the Shandilya Muni who was the guru of My family –

28:55.501 --> 28:58.501
that’s why My gotra is Shandilya –

28:59.542 --> 29:03.042
it was in his ashram He stayed.

29:04.501 --> 29:07.709
So the Muni Shandilya told

29:08.459 --> 29:11.800
that, “See, this lady is a very pure lady,

29:12.000 --> 29:17.501
don’t disturb her, and out of her will come a very great saint

29:18.042 --> 29:25.042
who will, by his own devotion,

29:25.501 --> 29:29.501
make the Incarnation of Narasimha –

29:30.125 --> 29:36.626
this is the god Vishnu which comes as the half-cat –

29:38.083 --> 29:40.584
and He will kill this asura.

29:41.083 --> 29:45.883
Now, part of the Egypt was also ruled by this Hiranyakashipu,

29:46.083 --> 29:50.083
part of the Egypt – see how significant everything is.

29:51.542 --> 29:53.467
So this Narasimha came

29:53.667 --> 29:59.501
when…  you know about Prahlada’s story, alright, so this

30:00.375 --> 30:03.259
little boy played there around and he made some

30:03.459 --> 30:08.459
things and there’s a temple very near – you have seen Narasimha’s temple

30:08.667 --> 30:13.584
and that you have seen the statue made out of sand?

30:14.000 --> 30:15.967
That was made by Prahlad,

30:16.167 --> 30:19.509
and he came into the dreams of someone and said that,

30:19.709 --> 30:23.042
“In your temple you please put the statue I have made”,

30:23.250 --> 30:27.000
and they went around the Nira river and found it and put it there.

30:27.334 --> 30:30.209
So see the relationship, how it is.

30:30.542 --> 30:35.459
Now this Hiranyakashipu was killed by Narasimha.

30:36.083 --> 30:43.501
Narasimha, as you know, is the Incarnation of Shri Vishnu,

30:44.209 --> 30:51.167
because he had, this Hiranyakashipu had, a blessing of Brahmadeva

30:51.584 --> 30:57.426
that not any animal can kill him,

30:57.626 --> 31:00.134
not any human being can kill him,

31:00.334 --> 31:04.334
not on the land or in the sky,

31:05.083 --> 31:07.800
and not with any weapon –

31:08.000 --> 31:10.800
all so many blessings he had taken!

31:11.000 --> 31:13.709
He had closed all the lines, you see,

31:14.000 --> 31:16.083
so that nobody should kill him,

31:17.000 --> 31:22.542
but actually he did not know there are ways and matters.

31:23.626 --> 31:27.467
So Shri Vishnu took the form of Narasimha,

31:27.667 --> 31:31.667
is that He became the simha,

31:32.167 --> 31:37.250
means the ‘lion’, and the lower portion of a man.

31:38.417 --> 31:43.667
And it so happened that Hiranyakashipu asked Prahlada,

31:44.083 --> 31:47.009
“Where is your God?” He said, “He’s everywhere.”

31:47.209 --> 31:51.209
So he said, “Alright, is He in this pillar?”

31:52.000 --> 31:54.334
He said, “Yes, He’s in this pillar also.”

31:54.542 --> 31:58.050
So he hit the pillar – see, the pillar

31:58.250 --> 32:01.217
must have been the same style as you make, Greek style,

32:01.417 --> 32:03.384
pillar of stone,

32:03.584 --> 32:07.584
so he knew that in the pillar how can anybody be, it’s a stone –

32:08.000 --> 32:13.459
he hit it and the pillar broke, out of which came out Narasimha

32:14.125 --> 32:16.384
with long hands and claws,

32:16.584 --> 32:19.217
and He took that Hiranyakashipu

32:19.417 --> 32:24.667
and put him on His lap, because neither on the sky nor on the ground

32:25.250 --> 32:30.000
and with His claws, because they were not weapons,

32:30.250 --> 32:32.375
He opened his stomach and killed him.

32:34.501 --> 32:37.301
So, because he was also ruling in Egypt,

32:37.501 --> 32:42.009
the people of Egypt made their…

32:42.209 --> 32:45.584
they were Assyrians – Assyrians are asuras,

32:46.584 --> 32:49.584
they were the ones who were asuras,

32:50.250 --> 32:52.250
that’s why they were called Assyrians –

32:53.000 --> 32:59.000
so they made the statue of their god Sphinx

32:59.417 --> 33:02.667
the other way round than Narasimha.

33:05.375 --> 33:10.467
So the upper part of the Sphinx is that of man,

33:10.667 --> 33:17.667
and the lower part of that statue is that of lion.

33:19.250 --> 33:22.292
This is very ancient story I’m telling.

33:24.542 --> 33:30.259
So how the Greeks went to India long time back,

33:30.459 --> 33:33.459
because all these devas were Greeks –

33:34.209 --> 33:36.967
and these devas were, like Indra,

33:37.167 --> 33:40.167
what He did, and Varuna and all these things.

33:41.417 --> 33:44.175
But I think there… because

33:44.375 --> 33:48.209
the whole idea got perverted, whole thing,

33:48.626 --> 33:54.626
they could not see the proper image of their...

33:56.209 --> 34:01.626
of their...faces in their meditation

34:02.167 --> 34:03.842
because they perverted them

34:04.042 --> 34:06.842
so they could not see, and they saw perverted faces.

34:07.042 --> 34:11.009
They saw them nude and that kind of thing,

34:11.209 --> 34:13.800
which was all their own imagination

34:14.000 --> 34:17.967
working, because they were indulging into all kinds of immoral things

34:18.167 --> 34:24.209
so they made it absolutely, what you call a ...

34:25.042 --> 34:31.584
very immoral type of relationships and things among them.

34:32.042 --> 34:34.092
So that was their own ideas and they put it.

34:34.292 --> 34:37.426
But also, as a result of that, they could never see

34:37.626 --> 34:42.467
the body or the faces of these devatas properly.

34:42.667 --> 34:46.667
So they made them more like…

34:48.083 --> 34:51.217
I mean quite ugly-looking faces they made.

34:51.417 --> 34:54.092
Like I have some Poseidon they have made here

34:54.292 --> 34:57.342
which they gave it to My husband also – it’s not at all

34:57.542 --> 34:59.800
like Varuna, I can tell you.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.967
So… and absolutely nude, you know; it’s so embarrassing.

35:03.167 --> 35:05.467
They gave it to My husband and he didn’t know where to look,

35:05.667 --> 35:11.167
and I just started laughing because he’s a very shy man, My husband.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.009
And he had to put it in his office, you see,

35:14.209 --> 35:17.334
hidden somewhere and it looks very funny.

35:18.250 --> 35:23.209
And he was saying, “Why not we use a kind of a...

35:27.000 --> 35:29.842
covering with some silver?” I said, “It’s an antique

35:30.042 --> 35:32.626
they have reproduced; you can’t do it to an antique.”

35:33.000 --> 35:34.134
He said, “Alright; where should I put it?”

35:34.334 --> 35:38.125
I said, “Put it in some corridor there.”

35:40.000 --> 35:42.092
So with such expense they gave it

35:42.292 --> 35:46.125
but My husband was quite upset about it, you see,

35:47.209 --> 35:49.925
and every time he sees this gentleman he says,

35:50.125 --> 35:56.709
“You know, this gentleman is no good.”

35:57.334 --> 36:05.209
Alright. So then, this part of the history is there.

36:05.459 --> 36:09.709
On that history stands the modern Greek.

36:11.042 --> 36:16.501
So, if you see from Socrates to Christ,

36:17.000 --> 36:19.375
people had evolved we think,

36:20.000 --> 36:23.000
but they also crucified Christ,

36:24.083 --> 36:26.050
so what was their evolution?

36:26.250 --> 36:33.125
Though, if you see what Christ preached and what…

36:33.459 --> 36:38.459
I’m sorry, what Christ preached and Socrates preached,

36:40.000 --> 36:41.584
there is much difference

36:42.375 --> 36:47.375
because Socrates talked in parables, not openly,

36:48.292 --> 36:52.009
while Socrates talked in a very open way,

36:52.209 --> 36:55.259
in an open discussion, in open understanding.

36:55.459 --> 36:59.384
That shows only that the people could understand what He was saying.

36:59.584 --> 37:03.000
But still He was also killed;

37:03.459 --> 37:07.375
Socrates also was given poison and He was also killed.

37:07.626 --> 37:12.042
So that shows that, at that time also, the people in charge,

37:12.250 --> 37:16.250
or at the helm of affairs, didn’t know what was reality.

37:17.209 --> 37:22.501
So now, from Christ to Socrates and from Socrates to Me,

37:23.083 --> 37:26.626
we can say this way that we are talking about it,

37:27.083 --> 37:32.967
though Socrates came in the year – how much B.C. He was?

37:33.167 --> 37:37.501
Yogi: About 500 years before Christ

37:38.000 --> 37:39.125
500 before Christ;

37:39.417 --> 37:45.259
so might be that Christ must have felt that Socrates,

37:45.459 --> 37:49.167
He talked so openly, so nicely to people

37:49.501 --> 37:52.459
as because He was Primordial Master.

37:53.334 --> 37:57.334
He realised it, so He talked in parables.

37:59.083 --> 38:02.501
He thought that, “No use talking straight like Socrates”

38:03.000 --> 38:07.709
because… you see they are very straightforward people;

38:08.584 --> 38:12.301
the Primordial Masters have to be very, very…

38:12.501 --> 38:16.459
they are by nature extremely straightforward.

38:17.125 --> 38:21.175
Even today’s… those who were real gurus,

38:21.375 --> 38:25.175
they would not accept any person,

38:25.375 --> 38:28.134
they would throw away, they would beat people.

38:28.334 --> 38:32.301
Even musicians in India, those who are great masters,

38:32.501 --> 38:35.009
they would beat their disciples if they played something wrong;

38:35.209 --> 38:37.125
like very harsh people.

38:38.000 --> 38:41.467
So it was alright for Socrates also to tell things very

38:41.667 --> 38:44.800
plain and simple and all that, but still He was killed.

38:45.000 --> 38:48.292
And then Christ, who was 500 years later came.

38:48.542 --> 38:50.584
See, He saw the point

38:51.250 --> 38:54.626
that no use talking – because He came at Agya –

38:55.167 --> 38:56.842
talking in that way.

38:57.042 --> 39:00.009
If you tell somebody, “Don’t do like this”,

39:00.209 --> 39:02.542
even reason it out like Socrates did,

39:03.000 --> 39:06.301
He is the master of logic, you can call Him;

39:06.501 --> 39:09.459
the whole logic system comes from Him,

39:10.292 --> 39:12.092
He’s a master of logic.

39:12.292 --> 39:18.000
But despite that, it did not appeal to the logic of the people who were at the helm of affairs.

39:18.501 --> 39:22.092
So they have no logic in their heads, you see, they are just rationalist.

39:22.292 --> 39:26.667
Rationality is blindness but there’s no logic.

39:27.292 --> 39:30.967
So because there is no logic they killed Him.

39:31.167 --> 39:34.417
And Christ understood that there is no logic

39:34.626 --> 39:37.626
with these people so better talk to them in parables.

39:38.334 --> 39:41.042
So He talked to them in parables,

39:42.000 --> 39:43.667
but still they killed Him.

39:44.626 --> 39:49.259
[ Helm! ] The authorities, they couldn’t bear, they thought

39:49.459 --> 39:53.667
He’s becoming very powerful, or whatever it was. The Jews themselves

39:54.292 --> 39:57.292
were very funny, and they did it.

39:59.250 --> 40:04.584
So in Sahaja Yoga, what I decided that at least

40:05.167 --> 40:08.542
I should give Realisation to people first,

40:10.334 --> 40:13.709
and then I can talk to them whatever I like.

40:14.167 --> 40:16.842
Now, I’m talking to you everything

40:17.042 --> 40:19.883
and you are understanding it because you are Realised souls,

40:20.083 --> 40:23.083
but I cannot talk this to an ordinary person.

40:23.459 --> 40:28.167
So we have two types of people: one who are Sahaja Yogis,

40:28.501 --> 40:30.175
and one who are not.

40:30.375 --> 40:34.342
Of course there are some Sahaja Yogis who are not very worthy of this,

40:34.542 --> 40:38.925
I agree, and they may just go back or something,

40:39.125 --> 40:45.134
but you can become worthy of understanding all this knowledge

40:45.334 --> 40:49.134
because your Kundalini can make you so capable

40:49.334 --> 40:53.175
and your Sahastrara so good that you can absorb what I’m saying,

40:53.375 --> 40:56.800
and can logically see what I’m saying is true,

40:57.000 --> 41:01.542
and you can also verify it, whether it is true or not.

41:02.000 --> 41:06.259
So this stage of yours, I think, is the highest stage of awareness

41:06.459 --> 41:09.301
where collectively you are understanding Me.

41:09.501 --> 41:12.509
The situation is not so bad as that was

41:12.709 --> 41:15.217
even at the time of Christ.

41:15.417 --> 41:17.342
Before that, at Socrates’ time, I think,

41:17.542 --> 41:20.542
He was the only wise man going around.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.301
There was nobody else, seems to Me, had any wisdom.

41:23.501 --> 41:26.342
Even His disciples, you see, like Plato –

41:26.542 --> 41:30.501
he went off his head, then Aristotle went off his head.

41:31.083 --> 41:34.209
Both of them, really,

41:34.542 --> 41:37.925
tried to have their own arbitrary additions

41:38.125 --> 41:40.175
which were all absolutely.

41:40.375 --> 41:43.134
But He talked absolutely…

41:43.334 --> 41:47.426
Socrates talked absolutely about gods and everything,

41:47.626 --> 41:49.626
and talked so openly.

41:50.209 --> 41:53.417
Then, in the same way, we can say,

41:53.626 --> 41:56.584
the Primordial Master state is that

41:57.042 --> 42:00.417
we have Mohammad Sahib. He was also killed;

42:01.501 --> 42:05.459
He was also killed because He told the truth.

42:06.000 --> 42:09.584
Then came Nanaka;

42:10.000 --> 42:13.000
He was not killed but nobody bothered about Him,

42:13.417 --> 42:17.292
and the people who really follow Him are just

42:18.501 --> 42:20.217
in the opposite direction.

42:20.417 --> 42:22.800
Supposing He was saying, “Come this way”;

42:23.000 --> 42:26.009
so they are going in that way.

42:26.209 --> 42:29.925
You find even same thing with Christ;

42:30.125 --> 42:34.459
if Christ said, “Come this way” the Christians are going that way.

42:35.167 --> 42:37.925
Every religion is just the same.

42:38.125 --> 42:40.925
Same with Krishna’s Gita.

42:41.125 --> 42:44.542
Those who preach Gita are just…

42:45.000 --> 42:47.050
if Krishna is standing here and saying,

42:47.250 --> 42:49.883
“Come this way” Gita is saying, they are preaching Gita

42:50.083 --> 42:52.342
going down, taking people down.

42:52.542 --> 42:55.542
So it is common with all religions

42:56.501 --> 43:01.292
that they have always used the name of prophets

43:02.125 --> 43:08.301
and of all the Incarnations just to make money

43:08.501 --> 43:15.501
and to take everybody to hell; straightforward march to hell you see.

43:16.501 --> 43:18.800
So, now those who are alert about it,

43:19.000 --> 43:23.042
and those who have seen that this is all nonsense are in Sahaja Yoga

43:24.667 --> 43:26.667
and sahaja yogis can’t do that

43:27.042 --> 43:30.667
because they have come quite a long way now on this side,

43:31.250 --> 43:35.250
so they are going to pull out many others to that side

43:36.334 --> 43:39.050
instead of going themselves down.

43:39.250 --> 43:45.050
So this is the situation today, and that’s why I say Greece

43:45.250 --> 43:48.883
is a very wonderful area where we can work it out.

43:49.083 --> 43:51.709
If Athena could be awakened here,

43:52.042 --> 43:56.000
this place could be of very great help to us.

43:56.584 --> 44:02.009
Now there are very balanced Greek people,

44:02.209 --> 44:06.800
they have great sense of art because of Right-side Swadhishthana;

44:07.000 --> 44:12.384
also they have lots of qualities of

44:12.584 --> 44:19.125
understanding the worthlessness of

44:19.417 --> 44:26.050
too much indulgences and all that. It is so.

44:26.250 --> 44:28.259
But the immorality grew,

44:28.459 --> 44:32.050
now, because they started copying Westerners;

44:32.250 --> 44:35.501
otherwise the women here were very moral women.

44:36.042 --> 44:40.167
This is only in these twenty years this change has come.

44:40.501 --> 44:43.842
Before that the women were very moral,

44:44.042 --> 44:46.501
very good women lived here,

44:47.000 --> 44:51.417
and some of them are now in India as I told you, they came with Alexander,

44:52.000 --> 44:55.842
and they were very good husbands and wives and very good families.

44:56.042 --> 44:58.175
This is only – I don’t know why – about twenty years

44:58.375 --> 45:00.800
or twenty-five years at the most, you can say,

45:01.000 --> 45:03.800
the Kali Yuga is showing its effects here also,

45:04.000 --> 45:07.626
but it’s a very solid country and still they respect,

45:08.042 --> 45:12.042
respect a woman who has character; respect her.

45:12.501 --> 45:15.217
They may use a woman who has no character

45:15.417 --> 45:17.426
but they respect the woman who has character

45:17.626 --> 45:19.925
and also respect the mother.

45:20.125 --> 45:23.259
So there are lots of qualities in this country

45:23.459 --> 45:27.050
which are still existing,

45:27.250 --> 45:31.626
in some places lingering, and some places effective.

45:32.042 --> 45:35.967
So the job of Sahaja Yogis is to, somehow or other,

45:36.167 --> 45:42.175
evoke that integrating force in them of the Athena,

45:42.375 --> 45:45.667
and I’m sure you can purify this country.

45:46.209 --> 45:48.250
May God bless you!

46:05.292 --> 46:08.175
Alexander was two hundred before Christ…

46:08.375 --> 46:11.292
a hundred, two hundred before Christ.

46:24.250 --> 46:28.250
He was very much respected in India, always,

46:29.083 --> 46:32.083
Alexander was very much respected in India,

46:32.334 --> 46:35.334
and because he went away

46:36.042 --> 46:39.042
and he didn’t take away anything from India.

46:40.250 --> 46:44.501
Like any other invaders who came, who just looted us, he did not.

46:45.542 --> 46:47.709
I think he got quite detached

46:48.167 --> 46:51.175
after coming to India. Anybody who has

46:51.375 --> 46:55.342
come to invade India, and has really gained something

46:55.542 --> 46:58.667
out of the spirituality of India, was Alexander;

46:59.000 --> 47:01.800
otherwise the English lived for three hundred in India,

47:02.000 --> 47:02.967
three hundred years.

47:03.167 --> 47:06.125
Nothing went into their heads, nothing.

47:07.000 --> 47:10.000
Three hundred years! Can you believe it?

47:10.375 --> 47:14.042
They used to laugh at everything, they used to make fun of everything,

47:14.250 --> 47:16.250
nothing went into their heads.

47:18.167 --> 47:21.709
But so many Greeks stayed on because they liked India very much,

47:22.083 --> 47:24.426
so they stayed back, they wouldn’t come back.

47:24.626 --> 47:28.626
So many are there even now living in the forests.

47:30.042 --> 47:34.301
So, this is something, is the sensitivity, the awareness,

47:34.501 --> 47:38.000
which has grown through times in the Greek people.

47:38.209 --> 47:41.217
You can see in the character of Alexander, how he was.

47:41.417 --> 47:45.125
There’s a poet in India called Chandav Rai,

47:45.417 --> 47:49.000
who was at the time of Alexander.

47:49.209 --> 47:53.709
Alexander brought him here, honoured him, kept him here,

47:54.083 --> 47:57.134
he was here, and he wrote poems about Alexander,

47:57.334 --> 48:00.375
about his greatness and things, praised him so well.

48:01.042 --> 48:05.626
I mean I can’t think of English people carrying any Indian as a poet

48:06.000 --> 48:07.167
to England;

48:09.250 --> 48:10.967
there’s no question. I mean, they didn’t…

48:11.167 --> 48:13.967
and the sign of awareness is this, that

48:14.167 --> 48:17.501
you don’t respect anybody else, you say, “Oh, I am the greatest”.

48:18.334 --> 48:22.334
Then you cannot see the goodness of other people.

48:23.042 --> 48:27.092
Same with Portuguese. Of course, Vasco de Gama was a simple man

48:27.292 --> 48:30.259
and when he came first to India, he saw Indians

48:30.459 --> 48:34.092
and he went to Goa and he saw the temple of the Goddess

48:34.292 --> 48:35.883
there, is the Shanta Durga’s,

48:36.083 --> 48:37.842
so he went back and told his king that,

48:38.042 --> 48:40.967
“They are all Christians because they follow the Mother.

48:41.167 --> 48:43.083
They are not Muslims”.

48:45.459 --> 48:46.842
So simple he was.

48:47.042 --> 48:50.050
“There’s no need to make them Christians.

48:50.250 --> 48:53.167
They are already Christians because they follow Mother”.

48:53.667 --> 48:54.842
He was a nice man.

48:55.042 --> 48:57.967
But Portuguese also never learned anything much,

48:58.167 --> 49:00.584
but still certain respect they showed, like

49:01.000 --> 49:03.375
the name of Bombay is Mumbai.

49:04.250 --> 49:06.083
They still call it Mumbai.

49:06.375 --> 49:08.050
many words Mumbai

49:08.250 --> 49:12.301
is the Mumba. Mumba-ayi, Mumbai  is the name.

49:12.501 --> 49:15.092
Means she is the Mother of Mumba.

49:15.292 --> 49:16.667
Like ‘ayi’ is the Mother,

49:17.125 --> 49:19.125
so they call it Mumbai –

49:19.375 --> 49:21.375
is the name of the Goddess.

49:21.584 --> 49:23.584
So they didn’t want to change it.

49:24.083 --> 49:27.092
And in Portugal, when I went, they were saying “Mumbai”.

49:27.292 --> 49:29.092
is the Mumba. Mumba-ayi is the name.

49:29.292 --> 49:31.384
“After all, it’s the name of the Goddess; isn’t it?”

49:31.584 --> 49:33.083
I said, “It is.”

49:33.375 --> 49:37.000
But the English came, called it “Bombay”- finished.

49:40.375 --> 49:43.301
So you see the… see the awareness,

49:43.501 --> 49:46.134
you can see the awareness of people

49:46.334 --> 49:51.384
because they were so aware about the serenity,

49:51.584 --> 49:55.092
about the holiness, about the auspiciousness and all that,

49:55.292 --> 49:56.842
so they said, “How can we call it Bombay

49:57.042 --> 49:59.584
because it is the name of the Goddess?”

50:00.375 --> 50:03.626
Just think- the depth, no? “We cannot call.”

50:04.042 --> 50:06.092
But the English could have gone and found out

50:06.292 --> 50:10.050
what is this place called, why is it called Mumbai.

50:10.250 --> 50:11.259
But they did not.

50:11.459 --> 50:14.301
But even if they had found, I don’t think they would have

50:14.501 --> 50:17.167
kept it as Mumbai. They would not have

50:17.667 --> 50:20.667
because, you see, that respect

50:21.209 --> 50:23.542
for serenity and all these things,

50:24.000 --> 50:28.217
somehow or other, in these people who ruled us, it was not there.

50:28.417 --> 50:32.292
Now the children of Britain

50:32.501 --> 50:36.042
are better, are very different, very different.

50:36.292 --> 50:39.667
But those who ruled us had no respect at all.

50:41.083 --> 50:47.209
They would only go to church, and nothing, no respect.

50:48.209 --> 50:52.209
While the Greeks had always respect for Indians,

50:53.000 --> 50:54.375
they came with respect.

50:55.584 --> 51:01.542
Now, the respect, also, is a kind of an awareness within us.

51:02.501 --> 51:04.301
And now, as the time has passed,

51:04.501 --> 51:07.083
I find Britishers have respect for others,

51:07.459 --> 51:10.467
they’re respecting, many.

51:10.667 --> 51:13.925
I mean, I would not say all, but quite a lot, isn’t it.

51:14.125 --> 51:18.083
Well, what do you say? He has not met any.

51:23.375 --> 51:27.375
Yes, that’s the part lacking- respect.

51:27.709 --> 51:30.134
That is the part lacking in England.

51:30.334 --> 51:33.667
And imagine in the heart, if there is no respect,

51:34.042 --> 51:36.375
then what sort of a heart it must be?

51:37.209 --> 51:40.209
The whole world can get ruined by that heart.

51:43.417 --> 51:50.584
So that’s the thing – one has to create respect:

51:51.125 --> 51:56.967
respecting others, respecting their culture,

51:57.167 --> 52:01.292
respecting their lifestyle.

52:01.542 --> 52:07.042
But, I mean whatever you may say, but theoretically it is there;

52:07.375 --> 52:11.000
may not be in practice. Theoretically it is working,

52:11.375 --> 52:14.175
because you’re not supposed to insult anybody

52:14.375 --> 52:17.584
who is from the ethnic group and all that is there legally,

52:18.083 --> 52:20.426
theoretically; but in practice it is not,

52:20.626 --> 52:23.626
I agree; but theoretically it is working.

52:24.292 --> 52:29.092
You can’t insult somebody because he’s a black man or he’s

52:29.292 --> 52:32.709
an ethnic group, you cannot, under law, you cannot do it.

52:33.042 --> 52:36.092
So that is there but just theory.

52:36.292 --> 52:40.009
But still, awareness-wise also, people are aware.

52:40.209 --> 52:45.626
I know of so many of them who were sitting in the sun

52:46.000 --> 52:49.000
and fasting for South Africa.

52:50.417 --> 52:52.709
So between the South African awareness

52:53.083 --> 52:56.342
and British awareness, we must say, we should be proud

52:56.542 --> 53:00.542
that in British awareness there is lot of sense,

53:01.501 --> 53:06.259
and that sense, once it comes to the point of respecting others,

53:06.459 --> 53:09.459
I think it can transform the whole world.

53:10.042 --> 53:13.501
But I don’t know how I have to do it, I’ve tried.

53:14.375 --> 53:16.417
It has to be respect.

53:21.250 --> 53:23.375
It is not insulting now,

53:23.584 --> 53:27.009
but it is not positive respect.

53:27.209 --> 53:30.925
So one has to learn how to positively respect;

53:31.125 --> 53:34.509
at least Sahaja Yogis must be positively respected.

53:34.709 --> 53:37.626
This is what I have been talking about,

53:38.042 --> 53:41.417
about Buddha, about truth, about respect.

53:42.250 --> 53:46.375
But once you know that they are Sahaja Yogis, one has to respect.

53:46.709 --> 53:48.925
And this one has to learn from the Greeks

53:49.125 --> 53:52.125
because still they have a sense of respect.

53:55.083 --> 53:59.083
They know how to respect, isn’t it?

54:00.292 --> 54:04.259
That part is there, that one has to learn.

54:04.459 --> 54:08.459
Even the Egyptians are, and also the Chinese,

54:09.542 --> 54:15.542
because out of all these years of traditional growth,

54:16.167 --> 54:19.175
they have realised one thing: that if you have to really

54:19.375 --> 54:23.334
exist in this world you have to learn how to respect others.

54:28.334 --> 54:30.709
And respect is something from your heart.

54:31.292 --> 54:35.050
Like the Japanese have no respect for anyone

54:35.250 --> 54:37.542
but they’ll go and bow ten times,

54:38.501 --> 54:42.092
don’t know when to stop if they bow, and if you bow they’ll go on,

54:42.292 --> 54:45.259
permanently, so it’s best if you stop.

54:45.459 --> 54:48.709
But it’s artificial; it’s not real.

54:51.292 --> 54:55.542
So it should come from your innate being to respect others,

54:56.375 --> 54:59.217
and when that works out then

54:59.417 --> 55:03.125
your awareness has definitely reached a very high state,

55:03.334 --> 55:08.250
high state of understanding of Divinity.

55:08.501 --> 55:13.501
So then you come to a point of respecting the Adi Shakti

55:14.125 --> 55:18.125
and then, when you have respect, it’s not artificial respect,

55:18.501 --> 55:21.467
it’s not artificial, it should be from your heart.

55:21.667 --> 55:25.667
And once you start doing that your awareness will improve.

55:26.334 --> 55:28.584
And that it’s not what you get,

55:29.000 --> 55:31.092
it’s not what you have,

55:31.292 --> 55:36.292
but what you give to yourself by respecting.

55:39.375 --> 55:43.301
And this respect in which transform you completely, I can tell you,

55:43.501 --> 55:45.426
because there’s a big understanding

55:45.626 --> 55:47.709
now between you and the Divine,

55:48.042 --> 55:50.384
and I’m sure everything will work out very well.

55:50.584 --> 55:54.584
The way the Deities respect the Adi Shakti, if you also

55:55.667 --> 55:59.883
learn that respect, then things will work out.

56:00.083 --> 56:02.050
And I think Greeks will lead us very well,

56:02.250 --> 56:05.709
the whole of Europe, in this respect; I’m sure about it.

56:06.000 --> 56:07.459
May God bless you!
