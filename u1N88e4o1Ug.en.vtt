00:01:46.492 --> 00:01:53.000
Everything in Sahaja Yoga is very scientific,

00:01:53.626 --> 00:01:57.626
is all pre-planned I think, and is all significant.

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:03.584
For example, today is Wednesday

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and we have never had any Puja on a Wednesday

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.542
because I was born on Wednesday.

00:02:11.375 --> 00:02:15.259
So I was thinking if the Puja starts before twelve o’clock

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.301
we’ll be able to manage it

00:02:17.501 --> 00:02:19.501
because I was born at twelve.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
So every child has to sleep after twelve o’clock, you see,

00:02:23.417 --> 00:02:28.259
and so I couldn’t, I had to sleep. So it’s so significant, you see.

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.800
It’s the first time we are having a Puja on Wednesday,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.209
normally I don’t even travel on Wednesdays.

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:40.092
So, you can imagine that it’s such a breakthrough and I’m very happy

00:02:40.292 --> 00:02:42.259
that you all are ready for a Puja

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.967
and that we could break this rule also,

00:02:48.167 --> 00:02:51.301
after such a long time,

00:02:51.501 --> 00:02:57.800
because it was impossible for me to keep awake after twelve, you see

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.426
I was trying, trying, trying

00:02:59.626 --> 00:03:03.042
and I knew that you all, also, were feeling very sleepy.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
So it’s so mutual and it’s so simple.Alright.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.417
So today we have gathered, really, remarkably,

00:03:22.334 --> 00:03:27.334
in the really centre of the Nabhi of the universe,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.800
and I don’t know how far

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
I can go with the description of this great country

00:03:35.375 --> 00:03:38.375
which we call as Greece.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:48.542
Also, in the Puranas it is described as Manipura Dweep.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.375
The Manipur is the Nabhi Chakra – Manipur,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.259
and a “dweep” is a island.

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:02.384
Island of the Manipura stays the Athena,

00:04:02.584 --> 00:04:07.459
and there is a temple of Athena,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.334
all been described about Her temple, about Her

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.250
jewelry, dress and everything.

00:04:21.083 --> 00:04:25.050
So it’s already in the Puranas described, this Athena.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.250
As I’ve told you before, ‘Athena’ means the Primordial Mother.

00:04:30.167 --> 00:04:33.259
So now, one may say that,

00:04:33.459 --> 00:04:35.709
“Why the Primordial Mother, Adi Shakti,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
should be on the Nabhi Chakra of the universe?”

00:04:39.584 --> 00:04:41.800
One may ask a question like that,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:49.000
that, “Why She’s placed on the Nabhi Chakra?”

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Because in the – I don’t know in English –

00:04:58.417 --> 00:05:03.417
before the Creation was created in the material form,

00:05:04.375 --> 00:05:07.375
where it was planned,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.584
then there was something of the –

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
what we call is the Vishnuloka,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:25.501
is the loka, or the area where Vishnu ruled,

00:05:27.042 --> 00:05:32.417
and in that Vishnuloka it was decided

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:42.083
that Adi Shakti should first come in the form as a cow,

00:05:42.667 --> 00:05:48.175
and then She should descend in the area called as Gokul,

00:05:48.375 --> 00:05:51.175
which is Vishuddhi Chakra,  first

00:05:51.375 --> 00:05:53.667
and create vibrations there.

00:05:54.417 --> 00:05:58.467
Now in the material form the Gokul was

00:05:58.667 --> 00:06:02.292
where Shri Krishna lived in His childhood.

00:06:04.334 --> 00:06:11.209
So in the material form, Athena itself lived –

00:06:12.167 --> 00:06:18.042
in the material form, I’m not saying in the formation before –

00:06:18.292 --> 00:06:22.709
in this area, to create the vibrations.

00:06:23.167 --> 00:06:25.626
So it is not only She was a Goddess

00:06:26.292 --> 00:06:28.584
but She lived in this area

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
to create the vibrations for the Nabhi,

00:06:32.584 --> 00:06:39.584
to create the universal

00:06:40.542 --> 00:06:45.384
compassion and love and all Her qualities.

00:06:45.584 --> 00:06:52.584
Now as you know, every aspect of the Goddess has different qualities

00:06:54.459 --> 00:07:01.459
and as you can see that Mahakali has the aspect of comforting,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
and Mahasaraswati is counselling,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.626
and the Mahalakshmi has got

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
for the redemption, for the awakening.

00:07:15.584 --> 00:07:20.050
But the Adi Shakti’s work

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:23.250
is to unite everything, to integrate everything;

00:07:25.542 --> 00:07:28.709
and to integrate all those qualities,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.800
the Adi Shakti Herself was…

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.626
in material form, came on this earth, in this part,

00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:42.209
and that’s why they knew about Athena.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
But as it is,

00:07:46.042 --> 00:07:48.050
I don’t know what are the stories they have–

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:51.092
they must be having some mythological stories about Athena

00:07:51.292 --> 00:07:54.292
that She lived like this or whatever it was.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.175
And this is the…

00:07:57.375 --> 00:07:59.584
where She created the Devaloka.

00:08:00.626 --> 00:08:05.000
Devaloka is the area where devas existed.

00:08:05.417 --> 00:08:08.000
Like She created Indra –

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:11.175
you have heard the name of Indra – then Varuna;

00:08:11.375 --> 00:08:16.375
all these devalokas She created in this area, not in India.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Devaloka was created on this side,

00:08:21.417 --> 00:08:25.009
and ganas and all these people were created

00:08:25.209 --> 00:08:29.667
on the side of Nepal and all those places, on the left-hand side.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Now unfortunately after Socrates, who came here

00:08:40.334 --> 00:08:46.259
in such a condition when people were really,

00:08:46.459 --> 00:08:50.050
absolutely ignorant, in the complete darkness of ignorance,

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:52.092
they could not understand Him,

00:08:52.292 --> 00:08:55.092
they could not understand Socrates at all

00:08:55.292 --> 00:09:00.259
and so like any other Primordial Master was treated

00:09:00.459 --> 00:09:04.459
by the people who were surrounding Him,

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:09.050
He was also very much ill-treated and nobody listened to Him.

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:12.301
But of course, as you know, He was Primordial Master

00:09:12.501 --> 00:09:17.000
and His wisdom is well-known and He created out of Him

00:09:17.209 --> 00:09:22.584
disciples, but none of them could go anywhere near His wisdom,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.800
and they started their own theories, own styles,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.800
and that’s how we find the accent from

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
philosophy that was Socrates’ aim,

00:09:33.417 --> 00:09:38.134
gradually came into political and then into economic side.

00:09:38.334 --> 00:09:42.175
So the attention was moved from philosophy

00:09:42.375 --> 00:09:45.175
to economics today,

00:09:45.375 --> 00:09:50.467
not towards the philosophy which was established by Socrates.

00:09:50.667 --> 00:09:55.217
We can say Socrates was the one Primordial Master,

00:09:55.417 --> 00:10:03.092
after Abraham and Moses, who really made it

00:10:03.292 --> 00:10:09.292
very clear-cut understanding about spirituality.

00:10:11.375 --> 00:10:15.175
Of course Moses and Mohammad…

00:10:15.375 --> 00:10:16.800
Abraham had different problems.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.883
Like Abraham had problems of talking to people

00:10:22.083 --> 00:10:24.584
who were  really very, very ignorant,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.417
and Moses had problem with people who were very indulgent people,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.050
so He had to pass laws of Shariat.

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:35.800
Moses passed the law of Shariat,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.709
and if you read Bible, in the –

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.417
I think – in the first verse only it is written about Shariat

00:10:43.626 --> 00:10:51.301
in the Jeremiah (Leviticus?), third book of Bible,

00:10:51.501 --> 00:10:56.092
that Moses had to pass these laws, different, different laws

00:10:56.292 --> 00:11:00.292
to make the people follow religion precisely.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.626
So He did not argue, He did not say

00:11:05.042 --> 00:11:08.301
why you should do it, didn’t give any explanation. “You do it!” Like that.

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:11.342
Because He thought that these people are so ignorant

00:11:11.542 --> 00:11:15.125
that you cannot leave it to their freedom

00:11:15.417 --> 00:11:21.667
that you understand this or

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:24.626
that you see the point;

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.417
He could not do that way.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.626
So He just said, “Alright. These are the laws, these are the things

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.009
and you have to follow. If you don’t follow then you will be killed,

00:11:34.209 --> 00:11:37.209
your hands will be cut, this will happen, that will happen.”

00:11:38.417 --> 00:11:41.417
Because the people were of that type.

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:44.925
Now then you see how gradually,

00:11:45.125 --> 00:11:48.967
at the time of Socrates people had evolved,

00:11:49.167 --> 00:11:51.092
they were a much better people

00:11:51.292 --> 00:11:55.292
so He could talk to them about something

00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:02.050
of wisdom, of honesty, of righteousness, of peace.

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:04.050
Of so many things He talked,

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:07.417
and He could talk because people were worthy of that.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.800
Otherwise He could have said, “Alright.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
You do this, you do that, you do that.”

00:12:15.626 --> 00:12:19.626
But see the difference also in the circumstances how what has happened:

00:12:20.584 --> 00:12:24.584
in the first circumstances when Abraham had problems

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.375
then the people were absolutely good-for-nothing,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.542
absolutely good for nothing, so He didn’t know what to do with them.

00:12:34.042 --> 00:12:38.667
So only, you can see it, in the time of Abraham that His own lifestyle…

00:12:39.042 --> 00:12:42.967
I mean, that was just a system when the family was building up

00:12:43.167 --> 00:12:45.626
and the relationships were building up,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.092
and He tried to work it on that level.

00:12:49.292 --> 00:12:54.292
Then at the time of Moses people evolved much more.

00:12:55.209 --> 00:12:59.000
They evolved but still very ignorant.

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:01.342
So they evolved to this point

00:13:01.542 --> 00:13:05.217
that He did not have to talk the things that Abraham talked.

00:13:05.417 --> 00:13:10.584
So He talked to them about getting out of Egypt,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.134
taking their freedom, getting out from there

00:13:14.334 --> 00:13:22.000
and going to a place of more tranquillity.

00:13:23.542 --> 00:13:25.384
But when they did that,

00:13:25.584 --> 00:13:28.384
He found these people on the way –

00:13:28.584 --> 00:13:32.175
when He went to get the Ten Commandments,

00:13:32.375 --> 00:13:35.375
when He came back – what He finds…

00:13:59.167 --> 00:14:03.626
So the people who were at the time of Moses,

00:14:04.125 --> 00:14:09.334
when He had gone to get the Ten Commandments,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.217
started indulging into very, very immoral character,

00:14:14.417 --> 00:14:17.259
extremely immoral character.

00:14:17.459 --> 00:14:22.800
They were very immoral and were doing such horrible things that

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.134
that nobody can believe that anybody

00:14:26.334 --> 00:14:29.009
who tried to escape from the Egyptians

00:14:29.209 --> 00:14:31.375
were worse than the Egyptians themselves.

00:14:32.334 --> 00:14:37.626
So He gave this Shariat to them, to change.

00:14:38.209 --> 00:14:46.209
Now then came the time when people were…

00:14:48.292 --> 00:14:52.925
I mean, despite all that people were not so good,

00:14:53.125 --> 00:14:55.125
we can say at the time of Christ,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.459
but they were not so immoral;

00:14:59.167 --> 00:15:01.626
they also could not understand Christ.

00:15:02.417 --> 00:15:07.217
So you see, despite all the human evolution,

00:15:07.417 --> 00:15:09.925
the human awareness evolving,

00:15:10.125 --> 00:15:16.209
the understanding about spirituality was very poor

00:15:16.667 --> 00:15:19.667
and you could not talk to them.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.417
Now you can also see the circumstances of things.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.626
When the circumstances are such,

00:15:29.334 --> 00:15:33.000
like at the time of, say Moses,

00:15:33.542 --> 00:15:36.342
that people are extremely immoral,

00:15:36.542 --> 00:15:39.542
they are doing all kinds of bad things,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.459
they are not bothered about their own destruction,

00:15:47.125 --> 00:15:52.125
the Incarnations had to move absolutely to the right

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
because they were so left-sided:

00:15:56.250 --> 00:16:00.009
So the Incarnations had to move absolutely to the right

00:16:00.209 --> 00:16:03.800
and say that, “If you do like this,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
this We’ll have to do” the violence part.

00:16:07.375 --> 00:16:09.375
So they took to violence.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:17.000
So the circumstances made the reactions of the people,

00:16:18.042 --> 00:16:21.967
also the awareness of human beings.

00:16:22.167 --> 00:16:25.167
So many things worked it out.

00:16:26.125 --> 00:16:30.125
Say, for example, when Athena came on this earth,

00:16:30.459 --> 00:16:39.167
her job was to create a integrated force

00:16:42.501 --> 00:16:50.250
which will have the whole chaitanya spread like an integrated force.

00:16:50.584 --> 00:16:58.584
So that when it will be all disintegrated later on it can integrate.

00:17:00.042 --> 00:17:07.042
So the Greeks have a job, special job, is to integrate.

00:17:11.292 --> 00:17:14.292
You have to integrate people

00:17:16.125 --> 00:17:19.125
which are left-sided and right-sided.

00:17:21.292 --> 00:17:24.842
And that’s what I asked him, “What happened to Hitler?”

00:17:25.042 --> 00:17:27.800
So they said that when they saw Hitler,

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.125
though Hitler respected them, they resisted Hitler.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:40.000
You can see the significance, how he respected the Greeks

00:17:41.042 --> 00:17:47.092
and despite that they resisted him

00:17:47.292 --> 00:17:50.292
because they were given this special capacity.

00:17:51.501 --> 00:17:54.301
Something with Greeks, they went to…

00:17:54.501 --> 00:17:57.501
I mean, except Alexander, only the one

00:17:58.375 --> 00:18:03.334
who tried to invade India,

00:18:04.167 --> 00:18:07.209
and because of the Greek nature he receded back.

00:18:08.375 --> 00:18:10.667
You see it’s a Greek nature

00:18:11.125 --> 00:18:14.375
that they can go so far and then not,

00:18:15.375 --> 00:18:18.375
because they have an integrating force.

00:18:18.667 --> 00:18:22.626
The same thing as I was asking him about what happened with the Turks.

00:18:23.417 --> 00:18:28.167
They had gone into Turkey but they receded back.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.459
So this power of receding back

00:18:33.292 --> 00:18:37.000
is the integrating power,

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.925
by you integrate within yourself

00:18:40.125 --> 00:18:44.967
both the qualities of the left and right and you balance it,

00:18:45.167 --> 00:18:47.501
and you see now that’s alright.

00:18:48.501 --> 00:18:50.342
If you have to be in the centre

00:18:50.542 --> 00:18:53.542
we should go up to a point and come back.

00:18:54.459 --> 00:18:59.417
And this is a very basic quality of Greeks in every respect.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.967
If you take their shipping,

00:19:02.167 --> 00:19:05.384
they were very aggressive in shipping to begin with,

00:19:05.584 --> 00:19:07.709
extremely aggressive people,

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.709
and Greek ships were known for not maintaining at all.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.800
They were not very law-abiding

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.426
so they were never used to maintain their ships, you see,

00:19:16.626 --> 00:19:21.301
and always under trouble – the Greeks –

00:19:21.501 --> 00:19:26.925
that in the shipping they were known to be, the Greeks have

00:19:27.125 --> 00:19:32.167
ships which are all falling off and rattling.

00:19:33.501 --> 00:19:37.501
So perhaps, perhaps,

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.501
they were aware that now the shipping is going to go down,

00:19:41.709 --> 00:19:44.709
so no use maintaining these ships, you see.

00:19:45.501 --> 00:19:48.925
Then when the shipping went down –

00:19:49.125 --> 00:19:52.584
you see this is on economic level I’m saying, how they worked it out

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
they sunk their ships

00:19:56.501 --> 00:20:00.501
and got the money out of insurance.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.883
That is a typical Greek style of behaviour

00:20:11.083 --> 00:20:16.250
is that they know already. It’s a kind of a wisdom,

00:20:16.542 --> 00:20:19.009
they know that how far to go.

00:20:19.209 --> 00:20:22.667
Like, we can see now, Onassis also married this mad woman,

00:20:23.292 --> 00:20:25.925
Kennedy’s wife, because  he must have realised

00:20:26.125 --> 00:20:29.967
that Kennedy never gave her any security so he married her.

00:20:30.167 --> 00:20:33.626
Alright. He married her up to a point,

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.883
but most of his property went to his daughter,

00:20:37.083 --> 00:20:39.083
not to Mrs. Kennedy.

00:20:40.334 --> 00:20:46.384
This balance and this wisdom is a special Greek style of life;

00:20:46.584 --> 00:20:50.134
that’s why you might say that they are not over-developed

00:20:50.334 --> 00:20:52.050
like Americans are.

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:55.342
But now Americans have realised that they are idiots,

00:20:55.542 --> 00:20:57.384
but Greeks can never become idiots,

00:20:57.584 --> 00:20:59.584
whatever you may try.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.626
They are very sharp and very intelligent

00:21:04.501 --> 00:21:07.501
but they know how far to go with everything.

00:21:08.542 --> 00:21:11.542
And what is the reason for this? The Athena.

00:21:12.584 --> 00:21:16.259
So Athena is the one, Adi Shakti,

00:21:16.459 --> 00:21:19.459
and She created Ganesha here.

00:21:20.292 --> 00:21:23.384
And the balance of the universe,

00:21:23.584 --> 00:21:27.259
or all the dharmas, is in the Nabhi Chakra,

00:21:27.459 --> 00:21:32.042
and so the people over here are very balanced.

00:21:33.334 --> 00:21:38.134
You can find them very…

00:21:38.334 --> 00:21:43.209
in their language, in their styles, very deep.

00:21:43.501 --> 00:21:46.342
One may say because they are traditional people,

00:21:46.542 --> 00:21:48.542
they have long traditions.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000
But Egypt had also long traditions.

00:21:52.626 --> 00:21:55.342
Of course Egyptians are, in a way,

00:21:55.542 --> 00:21:59.417
wiser than all other Islamic countries,

00:21:59.667 --> 00:22:04.667
but not like Greeks, not like Greeks.

00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:09.250
We have Chinese also who are very wise,

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:16.000
and they are known to be people of deep understanding,

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.334
but they are not like Indians.

00:22:21.292 --> 00:22:25.292
So what is lacking in all these people is

00:22:26.292 --> 00:22:30.292
the depth of awareness

00:22:31.209 --> 00:22:37.375
because, though in China also Mother of Mercy came

00:22:37.667 --> 00:22:44.626
and She really bestowed blessings upon them,

00:22:45.626 --> 00:22:51.301
and China rose also, afterwards,

00:22:51.501 --> 00:22:54.501
into her own glory

00:22:55.042 --> 00:23:00.542
and became quite a good industrial,

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.417
I mean developed country, we can say, very powerful;

00:23:05.667 --> 00:23:11.092
but still, that kind of regimentation could not be borne

00:23:11.292 --> 00:23:14.042
because, after all, Mother Mercy was there.

00:23:14.542 --> 00:23:16.134
Do you know last…

00:23:16.334 --> 00:23:19.092
you have one Mother Mercy you have given me –

00:23:19.292 --> 00:23:23.092
Kuan Yin, same thing, Kuan Yin.

00:23:23.292 --> 00:23:25.883
And She’s the same thing called as Mother of Mercy –

00:23:26.083 --> 00:23:33.083
and the second one was given by Gregoire recently,

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.542
and you see what’s happening in China.

00:23:38.417 --> 00:23:41.417
So the effects of these

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.584
Deities which existed in different countries at different times

00:23:51.292 --> 00:23:55.292
are felt only in Kali Yuga in the best way.

00:23:56.209 --> 00:23:58.009
Now you may say that,

00:23:58.209 --> 00:24:02.209
“Why should Mother come last to Greece?”

00:24:03.501 --> 00:24:09.042
Because now Athena is in the Sahastrara,

00:24:09.292 --> 00:24:12.384
so you have to go not in the Nabhi.

00:24:12.584 --> 00:24:16.050
So I had to bring Sahastrara here, isn’t it?

00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:19.175
Sahastrara is the last chakra one has to achieve,

00:24:19.375 --> 00:24:24.334
so I thought that let Greeks

00:24:25.459 --> 00:24:29.167
grow up to the Sahastrara point.

00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:33.626
So we have to establish Sahastrara in Greece

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:40.042
and thus it’s a very powerful work we have to do in Greece

00:24:41.417 --> 00:24:47.050
because actually, at the time

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:49.259
when Athena came here,

00:24:49.459 --> 00:24:53.584
it was not Sahastrara, it was Nabhi,

00:24:54.334 --> 00:24:59.584
because She was actually on the Himalayas, came from Himalayas.

00:25:00.042 --> 00:25:02.626
So now to bring Himalaya here,

00:25:03.125 --> 00:25:08.000
or to bring that purity in Greece, is a tremendous task

00:25:09.292 --> 00:25:11.626
and we have very few sahaja yogis.

00:25:12.292 --> 00:25:15.584
But you see the reaction of the gentleman who came?

00:25:16.083 --> 00:25:22.800
And we have formidable job because of these Orthodox…

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.209
most unorthodox,

00:25:26.334 --> 00:25:29.667
they have no orthodoxy about anything.

00:25:32.292 --> 00:25:37.000
So we have a problem, big problem,

00:25:37.584 --> 00:25:40.584
how we’ll establish here.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.217
The Devaloka was formed here

00:25:47.417 --> 00:25:51.417
and devas were here; they ruled here, no doubt;

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.417
but in the human awareness they're brought down to the human level.

00:25:57.417 --> 00:26:02.217
Like Zeus was Parashurama, Parashurama –

00:26:02.417 --> 00:26:09.501
the one who was an Incarnation to announce the advent of Shri Rama,

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:17.167
and He came before Shri Ram, died also very much before Shri Ram;

00:26:18.334 --> 00:26:24.334
but they painted Zeus as a man who was a womaniser.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.250
So all Gods were brought to the level of human beings,

00:26:30.501 --> 00:26:33.342
bestowed with all the weaknesses, you see,

00:26:33.542 --> 00:26:37.542
actually decorated with all the weaknesses.

00:26:38.542 --> 00:26:41.925
And that is responsible for the downfall

00:26:42.125 --> 00:26:46.167
because this part of the country

00:26:48.334 --> 00:26:53.334
is on the pattern of Devaloka,

00:26:54.584 --> 00:27:01.501
reflection of that, but this Devaloka is now,

00:27:02.167 --> 00:27:08.209
we see it has become just the opposite

00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:16.217
because Deities have been brought down to such a low level,

00:27:16.417 --> 00:27:19.375
to such degrading things.

00:27:20.125 --> 00:27:26.459
Even in the mythology also, in India

00:27:27.042 --> 00:27:32.542
talks about Them like this. Not to such an extent;

00:27:33.459 --> 00:27:39.209
like Zeus, they don’t talk but about Indra they talk.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:48.125
And like Indra’s description comes like this:

00:27:49.417 --> 00:27:56.301
that the king Hiranyakashipu’s wife was living…

00:27:56.501 --> 00:28:01.842
his wife… Hiranyakashipu’s wife was a saintly lady

00:28:02.042 --> 00:28:07.259
and Hiranyakashipu was ruling in the area of

00:28:07.459 --> 00:28:12.501
you can say Kandahar and Afghanistan and all these places,

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.459
and from here Indra went down

00:28:18.501 --> 00:28:21.501
and took away the wife.

00:28:22.501 --> 00:28:26.501
I mean They incarnated, the Gods incarnated here,

00:28:27.542 --> 00:28:30.301
and Indra went down,

00:28:30.501 --> 00:28:34.301
He took away the wife of Hiranyakashipu with Him, to save Her,

00:28:34.501 --> 00:28:38.501
and He went down and stayed in an ashram in Maharashtra

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.417
where there’s a river flowing with My name – Nira.

00:28:44.584 --> 00:28:47.967
So now the… see how the combinations are,

00:28:48.167 --> 00:28:55.301
the Shandilya Muni who was the guru of My family –

00:28:55.501 --> 00:28:58.501
that’s why My gotra is Shandilya –

00:28:59.542 --> 00:29:03.042
it was in his ashram He stayed.

00:29:04.501 --> 00:29:07.709
So the Muni Shandilya told

00:29:08.459 --> 00:29:11.800
that, “See, this lady is a very pure lady,

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.501
don’t disturb her, and out of her will come a very great saint

00:29:18.042 --> 00:29:25.042
who will, by his own devotion,

00:29:25.501 --> 00:29:29.501
make the Incarnation of Narasimha –

00:29:30.125 --> 00:29:36.626
this is the god Vishnu which comes as the half-cat –

00:29:38.083 --> 00:29:40.584
and He will kill this asura.

00:29:41.083 --> 00:29:45.883
Now, part of the Egypt was also ruled by this Hiranyakashipu,

00:29:46.083 --> 00:29:50.083
part of the Egypt – see how significant everything is.

00:29:51.542 --> 00:29:53.467
So this Narasimha came

00:29:53.667 --> 00:29:59.501
when…  you know about Prahlada’s story, alright, so this

00:30:00.375 --> 00:30:03.259
little boy played there around and he made some

00:30:03.459 --> 00:30:08.459
things and there’s a temple very near – you have seen Narasimha’s temple

00:30:08.667 --> 00:30:13.584
and that you have seen the statue made out of sand?

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.967
That was made by Prahlad,

00:30:16.167 --> 00:30:19.509
and he came into the dreams of someone and said that,

00:30:19.709 --> 00:30:23.042
“In your temple you please put the statue I have made”,

00:30:23.250 --> 00:30:27.000
and they went around the Nira river and found it and put it there.

00:30:27.334 --> 00:30:30.209
So see the relationship, how it is.

00:30:30.542 --> 00:30:35.459
Now this Hiranyakashipu was killed by Narasimha.

00:30:36.083 --> 00:30:43.501
Narasimha, as you know, is the Incarnation of Shri Vishnu,

00:30:44.209 --> 00:30:51.167
because he had, this Hiranyakashipu had, a blessing of Brahmadeva

00:30:51.584 --> 00:30:57.426
that not any animal can kill him,

00:30:57.626 --> 00:31:00.134
not any human being can kill him,

00:31:00.334 --> 00:31:04.334
not on the land or in the sky,

00:31:05.083 --> 00:31:07.800
and not with any weapon –

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.800
all so many blessings he had taken!

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.709
He had closed all the lines, you see,

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.083
so that nobody should kill him,

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:22.542
but actually he did not know there are ways and matters.

00:31:23.626 --> 00:31:27.467
So Shri Vishnu took the form of Narasimha,

00:31:27.667 --> 00:31:31.667
is that He became the simha,

00:31:32.167 --> 00:31:37.250
means the ‘lion’, and the lower portion of a man.

00:31:38.417 --> 00:31:43.667
And it so happened that Hiranyakashipu asked Prahlada,

00:31:44.083 --> 00:31:47.009
“Where is your God?” He said, “He’s everywhere.”

00:31:47.209 --> 00:31:51.209
So he said, “Alright, is He in this pillar?”

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.334
He said, “Yes, He’s in this pillar also.”

00:31:54.542 --> 00:31:58.050
So he hit the pillar – see, the pillar

00:31:58.250 --> 00:32:01.217
must have been the same style as you make, Greek style,

00:32:01.417 --> 00:32:03.384
pillar of stone,

00:32:03.584 --> 00:32:07.584
so he knew that in the pillar how can anybody be, it’s a stone –

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.459
he hit it and the pillar broke, out of which came out Narasimha

00:32:14.125 --> 00:32:16.384
with long hands and claws,

00:32:16.584 --> 00:32:19.217
and He took that Hiranyakashipu

00:32:19.417 --> 00:32:24.667
and put him on His lap, because neither on the sky nor on the ground

00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:30.000
and with His claws, because they were not weapons,

00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:32.375
He opened his stomach and killed him.

00:32:34.501 --> 00:32:37.301
So, because he was also ruling in Egypt,

00:32:37.501 --> 00:32:42.009
the people of Egypt made their…

00:32:42.209 --> 00:32:45.584
they were Assyrians – Assyrians are asuras,

00:32:46.584 --> 00:32:49.584
they were the ones who were asuras,

00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:52.250
that’s why they were called Assyrians –

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:59.000
so they made the statue of their god Sphinx

00:32:59.417 --> 00:33:02.667
the other way round than Narasimha.

00:33:05.375 --> 00:33:10.467
So the upper part of the Sphinx is that of man,

00:33:10.667 --> 00:33:17.667
and the lower part of that statue is that of lion.

00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:22.292
This is very ancient story I’m telling.

00:33:24.542 --> 00:33:30.259
So how the Greeks went to India long time back,

00:33:30.459 --> 00:33:33.459
because all these devas were Greeks –

00:33:34.209 --> 00:33:36.967
and these devas were, like Indra,

00:33:37.167 --> 00:33:40.167
what He did, and Varuna and all these things.

00:33:41.417 --> 00:33:44.175
But I think there… because

00:33:44.375 --> 00:33:48.209
the whole idea got perverted, whole thing,

00:33:48.626 --> 00:33:54.626
they could not see the proper image of their...

00:33:56.209 --> 00:34:01.626
of their...faces in their meditation

00:34:02.167 --> 00:34:03.842
because they perverted them

00:34:04.042 --> 00:34:06.842
so they could not see, and they saw perverted faces.

00:34:07.042 --> 00:34:11.009
They saw them nude and that kind of thing,

00:34:11.209 --> 00:34:13.800
which was all their own imagination

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.967
working, because they were indulging into all kinds of immoral things

00:34:18.167 --> 00:34:24.209
so they made it absolutely, what you call a ...

00:34:25.042 --> 00:34:31.584
very immoral type of relationships and things among them.

00:34:32.042 --> 00:34:34.092
So that was their own ideas and they put it.

00:34:34.292 --> 00:34:37.426
But also, as a result of that, they could never see

00:34:37.626 --> 00:34:42.467
the body or the faces of these devatas properly.

00:34:42.667 --> 00:34:46.667
So they made them more like…

00:34:48.083 --> 00:34:51.217
I mean quite ugly-looking faces they made.

00:34:51.417 --> 00:34:54.092
Like I have some Poseidon they have made here

00:34:54.292 --> 00:34:57.342
which they gave it to My husband also – it’s not at all

00:34:57.542 --> 00:34:59.800
like Varuna, I can tell you.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.967
So… and absolutely nude, you know; it’s so embarrassing.

00:35:03.167 --> 00:35:05.467
They gave it to My husband and he didn’t know where to look,

00:35:05.667 --> 00:35:11.167
and I just started laughing because he’s a very shy man, My husband.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.009
And he had to put it in his office, you see,

00:35:14.209 --> 00:35:17.334
hidden somewhere and it looks very funny.

00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:23.209
And he was saying, “Why not we use a kind of a...

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.842
covering with some silver?” I said, “It’s an antique

00:35:30.042 --> 00:35:32.626
they have reproduced; you can’t do it to an antique.”

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.134
He said, “Alright; where should I put it?”

00:35:34.334 --> 00:35:38.125
I said, “Put it in some corridor there.”

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.092
So with such expense they gave it

00:35:42.292 --> 00:35:46.125
but My husband was quite upset about it, you see,

00:35:47.209 --> 00:35:49.925
and every time he sees this gentleman he says,

00:35:50.125 --> 00:35:56.709
“You know, this gentleman is no good.”

00:35:57.334 --> 00:36:05.209
Alright. So then, this part of the history is there.

00:36:05.459 --> 00:36:09.709
On that history stands the modern Greek.

00:36:11.042 --> 00:36:16.501
So, if you see from Socrates to Christ,

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.375
people had evolved we think,

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000
but they also crucified Christ,

00:36:24.083 --> 00:36:26.050
so what was their evolution?

00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:33.125
Though, if you see what Christ preached and what…

00:36:33.459 --> 00:36:38.459
I’m sorry, what Christ preached and Socrates preached,

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.584
there is much difference

00:36:42.375 --> 00:36:47.375
because Socrates talked in parables, not openly,

00:36:48.292 --> 00:36:52.009
while Socrates talked in a very open way,

00:36:52.209 --> 00:36:55.259
in an open discussion, in open understanding.

00:36:55.459 --> 00:36:59.384
That shows only that the people could understand what He was saying.

00:36:59.584 --> 00:37:03.000
But still He was also killed;

00:37:03.459 --> 00:37:07.375
Socrates also was given poison and He was also killed.

00:37:07.626 --> 00:37:12.042
So that shows that, at that time also, the people in charge,

00:37:12.250 --> 00:37:16.250
or at the helm of affairs, didn’t know what was reality.

00:37:17.209 --> 00:37:22.501
So now, from Christ to Socrates and from Socrates to Me,

00:37:23.083 --> 00:37:26.626
we can say this way that we are talking about it,

00:37:27.083 --> 00:37:32.967
though Socrates came in the year – how much B.C. He was?

00:37:33.167 --> 00:37:37.501
Yogi: About 500 years before Christ

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.125
500 before Christ;

00:37:39.417 --> 00:37:45.259
so might be that Christ must have felt that Socrates,

00:37:45.459 --> 00:37:49.167
He talked so openly, so nicely to people

00:37:49.501 --> 00:37:52.459
as because He was Primordial Master.

00:37:53.334 --> 00:37:57.334
He realised it, so He talked in parables.

00:37:59.083 --> 00:38:02.501
He thought that, “No use talking straight like Socrates”

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.709
because… you see they are very straightforward people;

00:38:08.584 --> 00:38:12.301
the Primordial Masters have to be very, very…

00:38:12.501 --> 00:38:16.459
they are by nature extremely straightforward.

00:38:17.125 --> 00:38:21.175
Even today’s… those who were real gurus,

00:38:21.375 --> 00:38:25.175
they would not accept any person,

00:38:25.375 --> 00:38:28.134
they would throw away, they would beat people.

00:38:28.334 --> 00:38:32.301
Even musicians in India, those who are great masters,

00:38:32.501 --> 00:38:35.009
they would beat their disciples if they played something wrong;

00:38:35.209 --> 00:38:37.125
like very harsh people.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.467
So it was alright for Socrates also to tell things very

00:38:41.667 --> 00:38:44.800
plain and simple and all that, but still He was killed.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.292
And then Christ, who was 500 years later came.

00:38:48.542 --> 00:38:50.584
See, He saw the point

00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:54.626
that no use talking – because He came at Agya –

00:38:55.167 --> 00:38:56.842
talking in that way.

00:38:57.042 --> 00:39:00.009
If you tell somebody, “Don’t do like this”,

00:39:00.209 --> 00:39:02.542
even reason it out like Socrates did,

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.301
He is the master of logic, you can call Him;

00:39:06.501 --> 00:39:09.459
the whole logic system comes from Him,

00:39:10.292 --> 00:39:12.092
He’s a master of logic.

00:39:12.292 --> 00:39:18.000
But despite that, it did not appeal to the logic of the people who were at the helm of affairs.

00:39:18.501 --> 00:39:22.092
So they have no logic in their heads, you see, they are just rationalist.

00:39:22.292 --> 00:39:26.667
Rationality is blindness but there’s no logic.

00:39:27.292 --> 00:39:30.967
So because there is no logic they killed Him.

00:39:31.167 --> 00:39:34.417
And Christ understood that there is no logic

00:39:34.626 --> 00:39:37.626
with these people so better talk to them in parables.

00:39:38.334 --> 00:39:41.042
So He talked to them in parables,

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.667
but still they killed Him.

00:39:44.626 --> 00:39:49.259
[ Helm! ] The authorities, they couldn’t bear, they thought

00:39:49.459 --> 00:39:53.667
He’s becoming very powerful, or whatever it was. The Jews themselves

00:39:54.292 --> 00:39:57.292
were very funny, and they did it.

00:39:59.250 --> 00:40:04.584
So in Sahaja Yoga, what I decided that at least

00:40:05.167 --> 00:40:08.542
I should give Realisation to people first,

00:40:10.334 --> 00:40:13.709
and then I can talk to them whatever I like.

00:40:14.167 --> 00:40:16.842
Now, I’m talking to you everything

00:40:17.042 --> 00:40:19.883
and you are understanding it because you are Realised souls,

00:40:20.083 --> 00:40:23.083
but I cannot talk this to an ordinary person.

00:40:23.459 --> 00:40:28.167
So we have two types of people: one who are Sahaja Yogis,

00:40:28.501 --> 00:40:30.175
and one who are not.

00:40:30.375 --> 00:40:34.342
Of course there are some Sahaja Yogis who are not very worthy of this,

00:40:34.542 --> 00:40:38.925
I agree, and they may just go back or something,

00:40:39.125 --> 00:40:45.134
but you can become worthy of understanding all this knowledge

00:40:45.334 --> 00:40:49.134
because your Kundalini can make you so capable

00:40:49.334 --> 00:40:53.175
and your Sahastrara so good that you can absorb what I’m saying,

00:40:53.375 --> 00:40:56.800
and can logically see what I’m saying is true,

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.542
and you can also verify it, whether it is true or not.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.259
So this stage of yours, I think, is the highest stage of awareness

00:41:06.459 --> 00:41:09.301
where collectively you are understanding Me.

00:41:09.501 --> 00:41:12.509
The situation is not so bad as that was

00:41:12.709 --> 00:41:15.217
even at the time of Christ.

00:41:15.417 --> 00:41:17.342
Before that, at Socrates’ time, I think,

00:41:17.542 --> 00:41:20.542
He was the only wise man going around.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.301
There was nobody else, seems to Me, had any wisdom.

00:41:23.501 --> 00:41:26.342
Even His disciples, you see, like Plato –

00:41:26.542 --> 00:41:30.501
he went off his head, then Aristotle went off his head.

00:41:31.083 --> 00:41:34.209
Both of them, really,

00:41:34.542 --> 00:41:37.925
tried to have their own arbitrary additions

00:41:38.125 --> 00:41:40.175
which were all absolutely.

00:41:40.375 --> 00:41:43.134
But He talked absolutely…

00:41:43.334 --> 00:41:47.426
Socrates talked absolutely about gods and everything,

00:41:47.626 --> 00:41:49.626
and talked so openly.

00:41:50.209 --> 00:41:53.417
Then, in the same way, we can say,

00:41:53.626 --> 00:41:56.584
the Primordial Master state is that

00:41:57.042 --> 00:42:00.417
we have Mohammad Sahib. He was also killed;

00:42:01.501 --> 00:42:05.459
He was also killed because He told the truth.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.584
Then came Nanaka;

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.000
He was not killed but nobody bothered about Him,

00:42:13.417 --> 00:42:17.292
and the people who really follow Him are just

00:42:18.501 --> 00:42:20.217
in the opposite direction.

00:42:20.417 --> 00:42:22.800
Supposing He was saying, “Come this way”;

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.009
so they are going in that way.

00:42:26.209 --> 00:42:29.925
You find even same thing with Christ;

00:42:30.125 --> 00:42:34.459
if Christ said, “Come this way” the Christians are going that way.

00:42:35.167 --> 00:42:37.925
Every religion is just the same.

00:42:38.125 --> 00:42:40.925
Same with Krishna’s Gita.

00:42:41.125 --> 00:42:44.542
Those who preach Gita are just…

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.050
if Krishna is standing here and saying,

00:42:47.250 --> 00:42:49.883
“Come this way” Gita is saying, they are preaching Gita

00:42:50.083 --> 00:42:52.342
going down, taking people down.

00:42:52.542 --> 00:42:55.542
So it is common with all religions

00:42:56.501 --> 00:43:01.292
that they have always used the name of prophets

00:43:02.125 --> 00:43:08.301
and of all the Incarnations just to make money

00:43:08.501 --> 00:43:15.501
and to take everybody to hell; straightforward march to hell you see.

00:43:16.501 --> 00:43:18.800
So, now those who are alert about it,

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.042
and those who have seen that this is all nonsense are in Sahaja Yoga

00:43:24.667 --> 00:43:26.667
and sahaja yogis can’t do that

00:43:27.042 --> 00:43:30.667
because they have come quite a long way now on this side,

00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:35.250
so they are going to pull out many others to that side

00:43:36.334 --> 00:43:39.050
instead of going themselves down.

00:43:39.250 --> 00:43:45.050
So this is the situation today, and that’s why I say Greece

00:43:45.250 --> 00:43:48.883
is a very wonderful area where we can work it out.

00:43:49.083 --> 00:43:51.709
If Athena could be awakened here,

00:43:52.042 --> 00:43:56.000
this place could be of very great help to us.

00:43:56.584 --> 00:44:02.009
Now there are very balanced Greek people,

00:44:02.209 --> 00:44:06.800
they have great sense of art because of Right-side Swadhishthana;

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:12.384
also they have lots of qualities of

00:44:12.584 --> 00:44:19.125
understanding the worthlessness of

00:44:19.417 --> 00:44:26.050
too much indulgences and all that. It is so.

00:44:26.250 --> 00:44:28.259
But the immorality grew,

00:44:28.459 --> 00:44:32.050
now, because they started copying Westerners;

00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:35.501
otherwise the women here were very moral women.

00:44:36.042 --> 00:44:40.167
This is only in these twenty years this change has come.

00:44:40.501 --> 00:44:43.842
Before that the women were very moral,

00:44:44.042 --> 00:44:46.501
very good women lived here,

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:51.417
and some of them are now in India as I told you, they came with Alexander,

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.842
and they were very good husbands and wives and very good families.

00:44:56.042 --> 00:44:58.175
This is only – I don’t know why – about twenty years

00:44:58.375 --> 00:45:00.800
or twenty-five years at the most, you can say,

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.800
the Kali Yuga is showing its effects here also,

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.626
but it’s a very solid country and still they respect,

00:45:08.042 --> 00:45:12.042
respect a woman who has character; respect her.

00:45:12.501 --> 00:45:15.217
They may use a woman who has no character

00:45:15.417 --> 00:45:17.426
but they respect the woman who has character

00:45:17.626 --> 00:45:19.925
and also respect the mother.

00:45:20.125 --> 00:45:23.259
So there are lots of qualities in this country

00:45:23.459 --> 00:45:27.050
which are still existing,

00:45:27.250 --> 00:45:31.626
in some places lingering, and some places effective.

00:45:32.042 --> 00:45:35.967
So the job of Sahaja Yogis is to, somehow or other,

00:45:36.167 --> 00:45:42.175
evoke that integrating force in them of the Athena,

00:45:42.375 --> 00:45:45.667
and I’m sure you can purify this country.

00:45:46.209 --> 00:45:48.250
May God bless you!

00:46:05.292 --> 00:46:08.175
Alexander was two hundred before Christ…

00:46:08.375 --> 00:46:11.292
a hundred, two hundred before Christ.

00:46:24.250 --> 00:46:28.250
He was very much respected in India, always,

00:46:29.083 --> 00:46:32.083
Alexander was very much respected in India,

00:46:32.334 --> 00:46:35.334
and because he went away

00:46:36.042 --> 00:46:39.042
and he didn’t take away anything from India.

00:46:40.250 --> 00:46:44.501
Like any other invaders who came, who just looted us, he did not.

00:46:45.542 --> 00:46:47.709
I think he got quite detached

00:46:48.167 --> 00:46:51.175
after coming to India. Anybody who has

00:46:51.375 --> 00:46:55.342
come to invade India, and has really gained something

00:46:55.542 --> 00:46:58.667
out of the spirituality of India, was Alexander;

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.800
otherwise the English lived for three hundred in India,

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:02.967
three hundred years.

00:47:03.167 --> 00:47:06.125
Nothing went into their heads, nothing.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.000
Three hundred years! Can you believe it?

00:47:10.375 --> 00:47:14.042
They used to laugh at everything, they used to make fun of everything,

00:47:14.250 --> 00:47:16.250
nothing went into their heads.

00:47:18.167 --> 00:47:21.709
But so many Greeks stayed on because they liked India very much,

00:47:22.083 --> 00:47:24.426
so they stayed back, they wouldn’t come back.

00:47:24.626 --> 00:47:28.626
So many are there even now living in the forests.

00:47:30.042 --> 00:47:34.301
So, this is something, is the sensitivity, the awareness,

00:47:34.501 --> 00:47:38.000
which has grown through times in the Greek people.

00:47:38.209 --> 00:47:41.217
You can see in the character of Alexander, how he was.

00:47:41.417 --> 00:47:45.125
There’s a poet in India called Chandav Rai,

00:47:45.417 --> 00:47:49.000
who was at the time of Alexander.

00:47:49.209 --> 00:47:53.709
Alexander brought him here, honoured him, kept him here,

00:47:54.083 --> 00:47:57.134
he was here, and he wrote poems about Alexander,

00:47:57.334 --> 00:48:00.375
about his greatness and things, praised him so well.

00:48:01.042 --> 00:48:05.626
I mean I can’t think of English people carrying any Indian as a poet

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.167
to England;

00:48:09.250 --> 00:48:10.967
there’s no question. I mean, they didn’t…

00:48:11.167 --> 00:48:13.967
and the sign of awareness is this, that

00:48:14.167 --> 00:48:17.501
you don’t respect anybody else, you say, “Oh, I am the greatest”.

00:48:18.334 --> 00:48:22.334
Then you cannot see the goodness of other people.

00:48:23.042 --> 00:48:27.092
Same with Portuguese. Of course, Vasco de Gama was a simple man

00:48:27.292 --> 00:48:30.259
and when he came first to India, he saw Indians

00:48:30.459 --> 00:48:34.092
and he went to Goa and he saw the temple of the Goddess

00:48:34.292 --> 00:48:35.883
there, is the Shanta Durga’s,

00:48:36.083 --> 00:48:37.842
so he went back and told his king that,

00:48:38.042 --> 00:48:40.967
“They are all Christians because they follow the Mother.

00:48:41.167 --> 00:48:43.083
They are not Muslims”.

00:48:45.459 --> 00:48:46.842
So simple he was.

00:48:47.042 --> 00:48:50.050
“There’s no need to make them Christians.

00:48:50.250 --> 00:48:53.167
They are already Christians because they follow Mother”.

00:48:53.667 --> 00:48:54.842
He was a nice man.

00:48:55.042 --> 00:48:57.967
But Portuguese also never learned anything much,

00:48:58.167 --> 00:49:00.584
but still certain respect they showed, like

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.375
the name of Bombay is Mumbai.

00:49:04.250 --> 00:49:06.083
They still call it Mumbai.

00:49:06.375 --> 00:49:08.050
many words Mumbai

00:49:08.250 --> 00:49:12.301
is the Mumba. Mumba-ayi, Mumbai  is the name.

00:49:12.501 --> 00:49:15.092
Means she is the Mother of Mumba.

00:49:15.292 --> 00:49:16.667
Like ‘ayi’ is the Mother,

00:49:17.125 --> 00:49:19.125
so they call it Mumbai –

00:49:19.375 --> 00:49:21.375
is the name of the Goddess.

00:49:21.584 --> 00:49:23.584
So they didn’t want to change it.

00:49:24.083 --> 00:49:27.092
And in Portugal, when I went, they were saying “Mumbai”.

00:49:27.292 --> 00:49:29.092
is the Mumba. Mumba-ayi is the name.

00:49:29.292 --> 00:49:31.384
“After all, it’s the name of the Goddess; isn’t it?”

00:49:31.584 --> 00:49:33.083
I said, “It is.”

00:49:33.375 --> 00:49:37.000
But the English came, called it “Bombay”- finished.

00:49:40.375 --> 00:49:43.301
So you see the… see the awareness,

00:49:43.501 --> 00:49:46.134
you can see the awareness of people

00:49:46.334 --> 00:49:51.384
because they were so aware about the serenity,

00:49:51.584 --> 00:49:55.092
about the holiness, about the auspiciousness and all that,

00:49:55.292 --> 00:49:56.842
so they said, “How can we call it Bombay

00:49:57.042 --> 00:49:59.584
because it is the name of the Goddess?”

00:50:00.375 --> 00:50:03.626
Just think- the depth, no? “We cannot call.”

00:50:04.042 --> 00:50:06.092
But the English could have gone and found out

00:50:06.292 --> 00:50:10.050
what is this place called, why is it called Mumbai.

00:50:10.250 --> 00:50:11.259
But they did not.

00:50:11.459 --> 00:50:14.301
But even if they had found, I don’t think they would have

00:50:14.501 --> 00:50:17.167
kept it as Mumbai. They would not have

00:50:17.667 --> 00:50:20.667
because, you see, that respect

00:50:21.209 --> 00:50:23.542
for serenity and all these things,

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:28.217
somehow or other, in these people who ruled us, it was not there.

00:50:28.417 --> 00:50:32.292
Now the children of Britain

00:50:32.501 --> 00:50:36.042
are better, are very different, very different.

00:50:36.292 --> 00:50:39.667
But those who ruled us had no respect at all.

00:50:41.083 --> 00:50:47.209
They would only go to church, and nothing, no respect.

00:50:48.209 --> 00:50:52.209
While the Greeks had always respect for Indians,

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:54.375
they came with respect.

00:50:55.584 --> 00:51:01.542
Now, the respect, also, is a kind of an awareness within us.

00:51:02.501 --> 00:51:04.301
And now, as the time has passed,

00:51:04.501 --> 00:51:07.083
I find Britishers have respect for others,

00:51:07.459 --> 00:51:10.467
they’re respecting, many.

00:51:10.667 --> 00:51:13.925
I mean, I would not say all, but quite a lot, isn’t it.

00:51:14.125 --> 00:51:18.083
Well, what do you say? He has not met any.

00:51:23.375 --> 00:51:27.375
Yes, that’s the part lacking- respect.

00:51:27.709 --> 00:51:30.134
That is the part lacking in England.

00:51:30.334 --> 00:51:33.667
And imagine in the heart, if there is no respect,

00:51:34.042 --> 00:51:36.375
then what sort of a heart it must be?

00:51:37.209 --> 00:51:40.209
The whole world can get ruined by that heart.

00:51:43.417 --> 00:51:50.584
So that’s the thing – one has to create respect:

00:51:51.125 --> 00:51:56.967
respecting others, respecting their culture,

00:51:57.167 --> 00:52:01.292
respecting their lifestyle.

00:52:01.542 --> 00:52:07.042
But, I mean whatever you may say, but theoretically it is there;

00:52:07.375 --> 00:52:11.000
may not be in practice. Theoretically it is working,

00:52:11.375 --> 00:52:14.175
because you’re not supposed to insult anybody

00:52:14.375 --> 00:52:17.584
who is from the ethnic group and all that is there legally,

00:52:18.083 --> 00:52:20.426
theoretically; but in practice it is not,

00:52:20.626 --> 00:52:23.626
I agree; but theoretically it is working.

00:52:24.292 --> 00:52:29.092
You can’t insult somebody because he’s a black man or he’s

00:52:29.292 --> 00:52:32.709
an ethnic group, you cannot, under law, you cannot do it.

00:52:33.042 --> 00:52:36.092
So that is there but just theory.

00:52:36.292 --> 00:52:40.009
But still, awareness-wise also, people are aware.

00:52:40.209 --> 00:52:45.626
I know of so many of them who were sitting in the sun

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:49.000
and fasting for South Africa.

00:52:50.417 --> 00:52:52.709
So between the South African awareness

00:52:53.083 --> 00:52:56.342
and British awareness, we must say, we should be proud

00:52:56.542 --> 00:53:00.542
that in British awareness there is lot of sense,

00:53:01.501 --> 00:53:06.259
and that sense, once it comes to the point of respecting others,

00:53:06.459 --> 00:53:09.459
I think it can transform the whole world.

00:53:10.042 --> 00:53:13.501
But I don’t know how I have to do it, I’ve tried.

00:53:14.375 --> 00:53:16.417
It has to be respect.

00:53:21.250 --> 00:53:23.375
It is not insulting now,

00:53:23.584 --> 00:53:27.009
but it is not positive respect.

00:53:27.209 --> 00:53:30.925
So one has to learn how to positively respect;

00:53:31.125 --> 00:53:34.509
at least Sahaja Yogis must be positively respected.

00:53:34.709 --> 00:53:37.626
This is what I have been talking about,

00:53:38.042 --> 00:53:41.417
about Buddha, about truth, about respect.

00:53:42.250 --> 00:53:46.375
But once you know that they are Sahaja Yogis, one has to respect.

00:53:46.709 --> 00:53:48.925
And this one has to learn from the Greeks

00:53:49.125 --> 00:53:52.125
because still they have a sense of respect.

00:53:55.083 --> 00:53:59.083
They know how to respect, isn’t it?

00:54:00.292 --> 00:54:04.259
That part is there, that one has to learn.

00:54:04.459 --> 00:54:08.459
Even the Egyptians are, and also the Chinese,

00:54:09.542 --> 00:54:15.542
because out of all these years of traditional growth,

00:54:16.167 --> 00:54:19.175
they have realised one thing: that if you have to really

00:54:19.375 --> 00:54:23.334
exist in this world you have to learn how to respect others.

00:54:28.334 --> 00:54:30.709
And respect is something from your heart.

00:54:31.292 --> 00:54:35.050
Like the Japanese have no respect for anyone

00:54:35.250 --> 00:54:37.542
but they’ll go and bow ten times,

00:54:38.501 --> 00:54:42.092
don’t know when to stop if they bow, and if you bow they’ll go on,

00:54:42.292 --> 00:54:45.259
permanently, so it’s best if you stop.

00:54:45.459 --> 00:54:48.709
But it’s artificial; it’s not real.

00:54:51.292 --> 00:54:55.542
So it should come from your innate being to respect others,

00:54:56.375 --> 00:54:59.217
and when that works out then

00:54:59.417 --> 00:55:03.125
your awareness has definitely reached a very high state,

00:55:03.334 --> 00:55:08.250
high state of understanding of Divinity.

00:55:08.501 --> 00:55:13.501
So then you come to a point of respecting the Adi Shakti

00:55:14.125 --> 00:55:18.125
and then, when you have respect, it’s not artificial respect,

00:55:18.501 --> 00:55:21.467
it’s not artificial, it should be from your heart.

00:55:21.667 --> 00:55:25.667
And once you start doing that your awareness will improve.

00:55:26.334 --> 00:55:28.584
And that it’s not what you get,

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.092
it’s not what you have,

00:55:31.292 --> 00:55:36.292
but what you give to yourself by respecting.

00:55:39.375 --> 00:55:43.301
And this respect in which transform you completely, I can tell you,

00:55:43.501 --> 00:55:45.426
because there’s a big understanding

00:55:45.626 --> 00:55:47.709
now between you and the Divine,

00:55:48.042 --> 00:55:50.384
and I’m sure everything will work out very well.

00:55:50.584 --> 00:55:54.584
The way the Deities respect the Adi Shakti, if you also

00:55:55.667 --> 00:55:59.883
learn that respect, then things will work out.

00:56:00.083 --> 00:56:02.050
And I think Greeks will lead us very well,

00:56:02.250 --> 00:56:05.709
the whole of Europe, in this respect; I’m sure about it.

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:07.459
May God bless you!
