[MUSIC]

00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:16,300
[MUSIC]

3
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:22,700
[MUSIC]

4
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,160
Can you turn the house lights off, please?

5
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:58,200
Good evening everybody and welcome to this [UNCLEAR]

6
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,880
of program on sahaja yoga, in the presence of Her Holiness, Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

7
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:12,140
We shall now going to have, now have a brief introduction on

8
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:20,940
the different aspects regarding sahaja yoga and basically it is going to be an introduction to ourselves

9
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:30,060
that after Shri Mataji comes and She begins Her discourse, we are going to try to have before that

10
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:36,000
a background in our minds uh.. as to what exactly

11
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:42,440
should we expect, what exactly we would have then and try to on the context the meaning

12
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:51,060
the things that She's going to tell you. Believe me, this evening is a [UNCLEAR] evening in the lives

13
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,240
of all those of you who are going to see Her for the first time.

14
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:03,740
To begin with, as we all know from different walks of life, through the ages

15
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:09,840
the prophets and the seers, after whom the great religions have been established,

16
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:18,700
have talked about an inner awakening, a search for the truth that exists within each one of us,

17
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:27,080
the realization of the Divinity that exists within each one of us, the awakening of Divine potentials

18
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:34,280
within each one of us and in doing so seek our integration, our union

19
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,620
with the All-Pervading power of God.

20
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:45,780
This has been called and termed through various terms, various modifications, various definitions

21
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,420
and one of the commonest ones is yoga.

22
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:57,200
Yoga actually means the union; The union of the Soul

23
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:04,900
which is there within each one of us and that of the All-Pervading power of God and in the union between

24
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:11,160
the Atma and the Parmatma or the individual Soul and the Supreme Soul.

25
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:20,200
Shri Nanaka, who established or after whom came to be established the religion of Sikhism, said very clearly,

26
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:26,100
''Kaahe he mann khojat jaaye, sada niwasi, sada Alepa, tohe sung samaaye'' -

27
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,200
Why is it that you go on searching for that

28
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:37,000
external, without, when that which is the highest, is the most sublime is in fact within you?

29
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:44,820
Christ spoke of the Kingdom of God saying that the Kingdom of God is within each one of us

30
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:50,700
and we have to reach that Kingdom of God, that we have to be born again

31
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:58,900
and upon which they [UNCLEAR] asked, one of the disciples that, ''Being born again, does it mean we have to enter our mother's womb?''

32
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:04,400
He said, ''No, the Kingdom of God which is within you has to be reached

33
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:09,380
to a process and thus you have to take to a second birth.''

34
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:19,020
Lao tse spoke about the internal river that flows within each one of us; Confucius said about the same thing

35
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:25,020
and thus you have all these people who have been through the centuries

36
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,620
speaking about something within each one of us that has to be awakened.

37
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:36,500
So what exactly were they speaking about? Were they speaking about different things - in fact, no.

38
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,860
Socrates said, ''Know thyself.''

39
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:47,280
The essence of his philosophy was to know one's own self - meaning to be realized

40
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:52,740
within one's own self. To have this union,

41
00:04:53,500 --> 00:05:00,100
to have this loss of attitude [UNCLEAR] between the self and the other person,

42
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:05,540
to have, in other words, the complete union that was to have the yoga.

43
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:13,940
Now, the instrument of this yoga resides within each one of us and it is possible

44
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,680
for each one of us to achieve this state.

45
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:26,820
At this point of time, permit me to emphasize, that what we are going to see just now, is nothing new,

46
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:32,980
is not an invention, is not a new discovery. It has been something which has been

47
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:40,620
spoken about again through the scriptures in the Bhagwad Gita, in the Bible, in the Granth Sahib.

48
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:48,580
In the Koran it has been said time and again and many have tried to achieve this state

49
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:56,540
and many did, however, their numbers have been far and [UNCLEAR] between because

50
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:04,460
because on the Holy Spirit ladder, on the process of our evolutionary scale, the time had not come

51
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:12,120
for everybody to achieve this state. As all of us know, human evolution has been progressing

52
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:19,500
for millions of years from unicellular actually simple organisms to highly complex,

53
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:25,060
highly evolved multi-cellular, multi-functional organism, which is the human-being

54
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:31,280
who is at the apex, the epitome of evolution - we have evolved to this [UNCLEAR].

55
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:38,820
But the evolutionary process has now reached it's penultimate stage and now we have to cross over

56
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:46,540
into that area whereby for the human level, from the consciousness at the human level

57
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:54,380
we have to achieve that which is beyond, which is beyond the limited human consciousness.

58
00:06:54,900 --> 00:07:00,440
and thus the time has come which Shri Mataji prefers to call as the Blossom time

59
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:06,600
where the Universal Self has to be reached by the individual Self.

60
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:12,500
The individual consciousness has to be integrated with the Universal Unconscious.

61
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,000
and that is where sahaja yoga comes into the picture.

62
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:26,240
Sahaja yoga makes this process extremely simple and the awakening of this power within us

63
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,840
takes place without any effort - absolutely effortlessly.

64
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:37,640
Sahaja yoga, by definition, is a synthesis of two words - 'Saha' means with

65
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:45,280
and 'Ja' means that which is born with. So sahaja means that which is born with

66
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,600
and that is how the yoga takes place.

67
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:57,340
Now let us see as to what is this instrument of integration that is present within each one of us.

68
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,200
As you can see in this chart,

69
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:07,740
we have about three channels flowing within each one of us.

70
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:17,380
On the right hand side we shall see a yellow channel

71
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:23,300
which is called as the Rajogun or is called as the Pingala Nadi.

72
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,920
On the left hand side we have, what is called as the Ida Nadi or is the Moon channel and

73
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:39,300
in between we have a channel which is called as the Sushumna Nadi or what is called as the Satwagun.

74
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:47,240
Now these aspects have also been spoken about at length in different philosophies.

75
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:53,600
The Chinese called it or have called it the 'Yin' and the 'Yang' or the power of

76
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:58,440
the action or that was the passive power and that was the active power.

77
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:07,000
In Ayurveda it has been called as the three different elements which govern the life of the individual.

78
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:13,580
And here we see that this is precisely what they have been talking about

79
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:21,080
that the right side, which corresponds to the Right Sympathetic system, is the channel whereby

80
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:28,060
we are able to act - it gives us the power of action. On the left side

81
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:35,960
which is, as you perhaps might be able to perceive, is the dark blue colored channel, which is the passive side, is the moon

82
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:43,720
which we call it the channel of the moon and that is the side which gives us the power of desire.

83
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,920
It is through this channel that we get the power of desiring things.

84
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:56,940
So we can desire through our left side that is the left channel and we can act out those desires

85
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:03,720
through the right side. The most important one, is the one in the center

86
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:09,860
which is called as the Satwagun, which is the central path of evolution

87
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:16,240
and within this central path are situated different centers,

88
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:24,200
different energy centers, which in ancient Sanskrit text have been called as chakras

89
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,820
meaning seats or seats of power.

90
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:37,240
There are about seven main chakras in the body and we shall take up quick look and follow them

91
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:45,780
and, of course, there is the Kundalini energy, a dormant energy lying within each one of us

92
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:53,580
which is, in fact, the instrument of our union with the Divine, which actually

93
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:59,780
brings about the union between the individual Self and the cosmic Self.

94
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:05,740
It is extremely difficult to cover everything

95
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:13,860
in a brief introductory talk but we shall try to understand as much as we can so that we can have, as I said before, a brief background

96
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:19,760
as to what we shall be privileged to hear once Shri Mataji takes the floor.

97
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:26,040
At the bottom we have a red colored chakra, which is called as the Mooladhara chakra;

98
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:32,860
Now these chakras are situated within the Central Nervous system - they are extremely subtle,

99
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:41,480
not perceivable to the human eye very visually, however, they have anatomical correspondences.

100
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,980
For example, though we may not be able to see the three channels

101
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:53,460
they correspond on the right side to the right sympathetic chain, the left side, the left side sympathetic chain

102
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:59,500
and the Satwaguna or the middle channel corresponds to the Parasympathetic chain.

103
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:07,300
Similarly, the seven energy centers correspond to seven anatomical plexuses

104
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:13,920
within the human body. A plexus is nothing but an aggregate of nerves.

105
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:22,700
So we start at the bottom, which is a red colored chakra, is called as the Mooladhara chakra, it is the seat of our innocence,

106
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:30,740
it is the seat of our purity, it is the seat of our chastity. On the awakening of this chakra,

107
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:37,960
through Kundalini awakening, these are the qualities that manifest within each one of us.

108
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:45,880
And thus as we progress through these channels, through these chakras which [UNCLEAR -I'LL ENUMERATE?] very briefly

109
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:54,100
what are the qualities of each one of these chakras and what are the benefits that we are going to get out of it because the bottom line is,

110
00:12:54,340 --> 00:13:00,400
okay if we do sahaja yog, if we take our Self-realization, what's in it for us?

111
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,740
So as we shall advance, we shall realize that there is indeed

112
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:10,640
a virtual storehouse of benefits for each one of us.

113
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:18,200
Above the red colored chakra we see a triangular bone which corresponds with the gross sacrum bone

114
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:24,600
at the bottom of the vertebral column. Here resides the Kundalini shakti, what is called

115
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:31,320
in Sanskrit as the Kundalini shakti. It is a dormant, residual energy within each one of us

116
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:40,140
and it is to the ascent of this energy that as we have said before, ''We'll seek our Self-realization.''

117
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:49,680
Above that we have a yellow colored chakra which is called as the Swadhishthan chakra, is the second center.

118
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:56,100
It is the center of creativity, of activity, of intellectual functions

119
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:03,580
and it is through the exercise of this center that we are able to plan, we are able to think

120
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:07,140
we are able to [UNCLEAR - ACT UP?], we are able to conceptualize

121
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:14,120
and naturally an over-functioning of this chakra can result in imbalances.

122
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:23,280
Above that we have a green colored chakra, which is called as the Manipura chakra, which corresponds to the Aortic plexus

123
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,820
in the human body and this chakra has

124
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:35,240
qualities which give us a sense of proportionality, a sense of balance,

125
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:43,120
a sense of satisfaction, a sense of integration, a sense of dharma

126
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:50,820
as is said in the ancient Sanskrit text, which means a sense of duty - a duty that is sacred,

127
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:55,260
a sense of duty that is there within each one of us.

128
00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:03,640
Duty as a citizen of this country, duty as a citizen of this, as a member of this social [UNCLEAR],

129
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:09,980
duty as a husband, as a father, as a son, as a daughter, as a friend

130
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:17,720
Within each of our interaction, within the social [UNCLEAR] we have certain

131
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,600
duties to perform in an ideal way, in a perfect way

132
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:29,480
and it is to this said that we get an ideal as to how these duties are to be performed.

133
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:36,280
Above that we have the fourth chakra which is also the heart chakra.

134
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:42,840
It has got two components - on the left side one and on the right side one as well as one in the center.

135
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:51,140
Through this center we get the power of comfort, we get security

136
00:15:52,320 --> 00:16:00,020
and it is this center, which is in these modern times, completely in a state of imbalance

137
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:08,860
because of a great amount of physical activity, emotional stress, insecurity through careers, through jobs,

138
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:14,800
due to various other factors - economic, social, convenient just naming.

139
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:21,320
So anything secretly results in an imbalance in this chakra and the raising of the Kundalini

140
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:27,620
puts this chakra in a state of balance giving us the gift of security.

141
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:36,960
Above this chakra we have the fifth chakra, which is called as the Vishudhhi chakra, which corresponds

142
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:44,000
with the Cervical plexus within us. This is the center of communication,

143
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:51,920
our inter-personal relationships - the way we relate to each other as family members, as friends,

144
00:16:52,120 --> 00:17:00,320
as individuals in a working environment, as, as individuals in this society, as citizens of the world.

145
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:06,140
This is the center that brings about integration within human beings.

146
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:14,720
Above this we have the sixth center, which is called as the Agnya chakra

147
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:22,240
and it corresponds to the optic chiasma within the human physical body.

148
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:29,220
As you know, within us in the brain there exists a place called as the optic chiasma

149
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:36,200
where the optic nerves actually cross over each other and then go backwards.

150
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,740
Now this was, somehow, known to the ancient sages, ancient prophets,

151
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:49,160
who through their Divine realization, had realized and had actually seen

152
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:54,920
this subtle system within each one of us and had already mentioned about it.

153
00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:02,300
So this is an extremely crucial center because through this center

154
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:09,540
we get the power of thought, the power of thinking, the power of rationalization

155
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:17,520
and the two channels of the left side and the right side, basically, cross over

156
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:23,220
at this point and terminate into the two balloons of the ego,

157
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:28,760
which is a yellow colored balloon on the left hand side of the head and into a

158
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:36,780
blue colored balloon on the right hand side of the head which are the corresponding the balloons of the ego and the superego.

159
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:46,340
Lastly, we come to the seventh center, which is the Sahasrara chakra, which is the seventh center

160
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:54,340
which corresponds to the limbic system within the human brain. Now this is the center which contains

161
00:18:54,620 --> 00:19:00,720
the seats of all the previous six centers and when the Kundalini

162
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:06,520
ascends through all the six centers and gets go up to then once again

163
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:14,940
the Swadhishthan chakra, then the second center, the Nabhi chakra or Manipur chakra, then the third one, the Heart chakra, which is the fourth one,

164
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:22,900
the fifth chakra, which is the Vishhudhi chakra, the sixth one and, finally, the seventh chakra which is the Sahasrara chakra.

165
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:30,920
Once the Kundalini comes out of the seventh chakra, it establishes a contact

166
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:38,160
with this All-Pervading power of God and that is the state which has been described

167
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:43,240
in all the Scriptures as the state of Self- realization.

168
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:50,600
This is the state wherein an individual becomes thoughtlessly aware -

169
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:59,160
is not that is not aware of his surroundings but he is in a state of thoughtlessness and

170
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:05,960
very difficult as it might perhaps be to believe this state is very easily achievable.

171
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:12,820
because as most of us know that when a thought process starts, it starts very slowly,

172
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:20,200
achieves a crest - achieves a peak level of activity - and then it gradually falls down

173
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:28,660
and then the second level starts, the second thought starts and throughout our lifetimes we spend consciously jumping

174
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,440
from one thought to the other, to the next and to the next.

175
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:41,860
However, there is a time between two successive thoughts when there is an infinitesimally

176
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:47,360
small space of time wherein you are actually thoughtless

177
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:52,340
but we are not aware of it because it is going on at such a fantastic speed.

178
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:59,120
Through the process of Kundalini awakening we can stay

179
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:06,260
between that [UNCLEAR - IN THAT OR INACTIVE?] period, between two thoughts and be actually thoughtless.

180
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:12,920
This is the state known as the Nirvicharita, which means the state of thoughtlessness

181
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,460
which has been described again and again through the scriptures.

182
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:25,340
My dear friends, what I would like to emphasize is, that sahaja yoga brings about this entire process

183
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:31,240
very spontaneously, very effortlessly without involving number one

184
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:37,680
any form of payment of any sort. You don't have to pay a single penny

185
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:44,380
to get your Self-realization because as Shri Mataji says, ''You cannot buy your Self-realization

186
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:47,980
and God, most importantly doesn't understand money.''

187
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:56,580
To achieve this state without any effort, without the chanting of any hymns, any mantras,

188
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:04,840
going through any long procedures of fasting, physical exercise, any physical [UNCLEAR], any conditionings,

189
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:10,200
you don't have to give up any thing, you don't have to take any preset conditions

190
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:17,820
It is extremely simple, it is extremely spontaneous, it is extremely effortless,

191
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:22,640
it is extremely effective - it works.

192
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:31,380
Sahaja yoga is today being practiced in more than 65 countries of the world including the former

193
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:37,840
Soviet Union and the Soviet Republics we have hundreds of thousands of

194
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:43,460
yogis all over the world practicing sahaja yoga. Now, what are the benefits of sahaja yoga?

195
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:51,020
Briefly as we have seen, each one of these chakras, have their special qualities

196
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:59,080
and as the Kundalini energy, which is like a Mother, which is our spiritual Mother waiting

197
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:07,160
to give us this great opportunity to be born again, She nourishes these chakras

198
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,700
just like a mother nourishes her own offspring.

199
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:20,060
And thus through the process of Kundalini awakening, the qualities of each one of these chakras

200
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:26,540
starts manifesting through each one of us and thus we can become

201
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:33,160
and we have such people all over the world today who are beautiful citizens

202
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:41,220
beautiful individuals leading extremely moral, chaste, beautiful lives serving

203
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:49,600
a great function not only to themselves but to the societies and to the nations of which they are the citizens.

204
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:55,160
These are the benefits of sahaja yoga in a nutshell.

205
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:02,740
Apart from this you also enjoy very good physical health, psychological health, emotional health

206
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:10,720
and mental health because sahaja yoga helps you to achieve a state of an integrated personality

207
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:17,640
where there is no conflict within yourself and thus you don't have conflicts with others.

208
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:24,020
You don't enter into conflicts with others because you are established in a state of peace

209
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:32,260
and when you are at peace with yourself, you don't feel like getting into a state of disturbance,

210
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:37,780
getting into a state of war even at a mental, at an intellectual level with others.

211
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:46,380
Let us now try to understand as to who is the person behind this great Spiritual happening.

212
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:55,140
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi was born in India in 1923

213
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:03,080
in a Christian family. She took part to, She was the child of

214
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:09,540
extremely patriotic parents, very learned, highly intelligent, very well educated -

215
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:17,460
Her father could speak so many languages fluently, Her mother was a Masters [UNCLEAR - OLDER, VERY OLDER?] in Mathematics.

216
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:26,260
Into such uh.., such a intellectual, highly gifted and patriotic family She was born in 1923.

217
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:32,780
As most of Marathi might be knowing, those were the years when India was trying to get it's independence.

218
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,360
and Her parents were deeply involved with the [UNCLEAR]. So at the very young age

219
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:45,820
She got Herself involved in the Indian freedom movement. She even stayed with Mahatma Gandhiji

220
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:53,260
in his ashram at Wardha and at Sabarmati in India and after Indian independence

221
00:25:53,760 --> 00:26:00,960
during those years She was married to a gentleman who later served extremely important post

222
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,780
within the Indian government and later on in the United Nations.

223
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:12,680
She was married to Dr. C.P. Srivastava, who was the personal secretary to the late Prime Minister of India,

224
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:19,780
Shri Lala Bahadur Shastri and thereafter Dr. Srivastava, Her husband, was for six

225
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:27,560
consecutive terms the elected Secretary General of the International Maritime Organization

226
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:31,500
which is a very important division of the United Nations.

227
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:39,040
The point that one tries to make is, Shri Mataji has been a married person,

228
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:44,900
She has two daughters, She has grandchildren and they're married

229
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:51,060
so She is an absolute householder, an absolutely seemingly,

230
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:57,580
an absolutely apparently and absolutely on the base of it a very domestic person

231
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:02,080
like you and me and each one of us in this auditorium and beyond.

232
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:10,180
She has completely played Her role as a daughter, as a citizen, as a wife,

233
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:16,520
as a Mother, as a grandmother to each one with absolute perfection

234
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:25,280
to such an extent that all of them even today are extremely devoted to Her. She enjoys a completely blissful

235
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:32,820
married life with Her family but beyond this She is the spiritual guide

236
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:40,760
to millions of Her devotees around the world and She has established this movement of sahaja yoga

237
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:48,480
at the same time keeping Her connection, Her duties towards Her family

238
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:56,680
which brings us to the most important point and the most wonderful point about sahaja yoga, which is that

239
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:04,840
you can have a state of God realization, you can continue to have your state of Zen,

240
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:13,280
your state of thoughtless awareness without having to divorce yourself from any or all of your duties

241
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:18,360
as a normal citizen, as a normal individual.

242
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:25,340
We can continue with our lives, with our careers, with our married life, with our social lives and yet

243
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:28,920
enjoy the state of bliss and happiness.

244
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,980
The reason why one tries to emphasize this point has been, is because

245
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:38,440
till sahaja yoga was brought into effect

246
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:46,280
people could achieve the state of Self- realization. However it took decades and decades

247
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:53,900
of, sometimes fruitless perseverance, fruitless effort to achieve this state.

248
00:28:54,120 --> 00:29:00,700
People had to leave their jobs, they had to leave their families, go and stay and meditate for years together

249
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:05,480
just to achieve that fraction of this wonderful state.

250
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:13,600
But after 1970, after Shri Mataji established sahaja yoga, this is the blossom time

251
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:20,960
when not one, not two but people in the thousands can achieve this state because human evolution

252
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:27,840
has reached a point now where they can get this wonderful happening within each one of us.

253
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:33,800

I bow to all the seekers of Absolute Truth.

414
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:48,460
At the very outset we have to know what is Absolute Truth is.

415
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:57,220
Whatever I'm going to tell you today, please do not accept it.

416
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:04,080
and do not take it for granted because this blind faith

417
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:08,960
has created so many problems as you know.

418
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:17,160
In every country we have people who have such tremendous blind faith

419
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:25,900
that for ages together, for generations together they have been blinded

420
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:33,200
where they are born, what is their community, what are their parents,

421
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:37,220
what nationality they belong to, what race they belong to.

422
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:43,000
All these have created tremendous conditioning in our mind.

423
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:51,700
and we are bound - we are not free - we are bound, bound by all these ideologies and everything that we have been hearing,

424
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:56,780
which we have been reading about, which we have been knowing.

425
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:03,080
So, for people who are seekers of Absolute Truth

426
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:08,820
must understand that so far have not found out Absolute Truth.

427
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:20,020
Now, what is the Absolute Truth? Absolute Truth has been told by all the great Incarnations and

428
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:26,120
all the saints of the world is that, ''That truth lies within you

429
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:34,740
and that you are not this body, this mind, not this

430
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:42,560
aspirations and ego and conditionings and also emotions

431
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:49,280
but you are the pure Spirit.'' This is the state you have to achieve

432
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:57,460
Now these modern times, I call them as Blossom Times - they are special times all being already predicted

433
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:04,560
in so many scriptures, especially, in a scripture called as Naadi Granth

434
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:11,520
written by the pioneer of our astrology, Bhrigumuni.

435
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:17,820
He said, ''At these times people who are seeking reality

436
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:23,880
or truth in the hills

437
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:33,680
and dales and caves will find the truth.''

438
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:41,340
Of course, as you know that many people are just get enamored by things which are hellish,

439
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:49,040
which are nothing to do with truth. Where you must have heard of so many people committing suicide,

440
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:55,800
going into big violence, killing others

441
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:03,380
all sorts of things which are hellish and they [UNCLEAR] that they are seekers of truth - they cannot.

442
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:11,420
Truth means tranquility, peace. It means

443
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:22,700
also joy. Have you heard of every saint who started a tirade

444
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:29,400
against killing others? Unless and until they were very much attacked,

445
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:35,400
like at the time of Islam, they did not take to it

446
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:39,300
because they do not feel safe and protected.

447
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:47,960
But the problem with all of them was that, they were not connected

448
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:52,580
to the Divine power of truth, to Divinity.

449
00:54:53,420 --> 00:55:00,880
In their thought they thought they belonged to some sort of a community, to some sort of a

450
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:18,680
and that is the point why they lost and we are surprised why should they suffer.

451
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:28,100
Now the time has come, special time as I told you, blossom time, where many flowers are born

452
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:36,060
and they have to achieve their complete maturity - become fruits.

453
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:42,560
This maturity will be possible if you have a steady mind.

454
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:58,560
They start doing guru shopping, going from one to another. If, say, a plant

455
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:04,080
is removed all the time from one place to another, how will it improve?

456
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:12,980
You don't have to pay for it. Also this is another very great objection  for Me that you don't have to pay for sahaja yog.

457
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:18,100
They think that if you have paid then you have to do less work - you have paid for it.

458
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:26,120
Secondly, perhaps, maybe, they might think, '' Oh, what is the credibility?'' Now, something that cannot be sold,

459
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:34,100
which is invaluable, we have to think about Christ, how much did we pay?

460
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:42,340
Think of anybody who was an Incarnation; How can you pay for your Self-realization?

461
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:48,940
How much do we pay for this Mother Earth which produces beautiful flowers for us?

462
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:54,880
We don't pay Her anything. In the same way you cannot pay for

463
00:56:55,460 --> 00:57:02,240
this living process of your evolution which is a last breakthrough, is the last breakthrough

464
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:09,940
of your evolution. So firstly we must understand what this can [UNCLEAR] in our way,

465
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:18,260
in our realization. If I say, this mind, this human mind is the most

466
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:22,560
artificially created obstacle by us.

467
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:29,980
Through our ego, through our conditionings we have created this mind which stops us

468
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:36,620
from entering into that realm of peace, tranquility, of Divine love.

469
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:43,760
How to cross this mind has been a problem for all the seekers

470
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:48,760
because it bombards you with thoughts, all the time it's bombarding your thoughts -

471
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:55,820
thoughts are coming from the future or from the past and we are not in the present.

472
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,560
Just now if I say, you be in the present, you cannot be.

473
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:08,340
You'll be immediately thrown to the future side or to the past.

474
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:14,000
These two sides all the time keeps us tossing.

475
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:18,700
The thought  comes like this and falls down, another thought comes and falls down

476
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:25,620
and we are dancing on the cusp of all these thoughts all the time and that's why we are restless,

477
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:33,240
that's why we are upset, that's why we have so many problems of our mind itself.

478
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:41,800
Apart from that we have so many other problems - many diseases are there

479
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:48,220
which we do not know how to cure and if you try to cure one disease, you get another one.

480
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:56,000
It's a very funny thing that if you try to cure, say schizophrenia

481
00:58:56,940 --> 00:59:02,920
you get another disease which is because of

482
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:09,280
Dopamine or what ever is, is called as - you get another disease which is more serious

483
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:12,420
when your hands, your feet all start shaking.

484
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:18,820
So now, between these two how are we in the center?

485
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:26,200
For that, our Creator has created this beautiful

486
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:31,340
subtle system within us - whether you believe it or not, it exists.

487
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:39,980
When you are suffering from [UNCLEAR - BODY'S?] diseases

488
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:47,940
and if your power, residual power, which we call as Kundalini,

489
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:54,500
who is your mother, your individual mother - all of them have your individual mother.

490
00:59:55,660 --> 01:00:02,060
she knows everything for you, she knows what are your aspirations,

491
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:09,560
she knows what mistakes you have committed, she knows where you have been - it's all recorded

492
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:18,300
but she's extremely anxious to give you this second birth and for that spontaneously she rises,

493
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:24,480
rises and pierces through this fontanel bone area and

494
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:32,900
connects you with this All-Pervading power of Divine love. We have heard about it, we have studied about it,

495
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:41,500
we call it by different names for disciple of Christ call it, 'The two breeds of the Holy Ghost,'

496
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:48,300
very clearly. Then in the Sanskrit language it's called as Param Chaitanya.

497
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:57,200
Also in the Bible is described as the All-Pervading power of Divine love and also

498
01:00:57,580 --> 01:01:02,540
Gurunanak and all these saints have described it as 'Alakh Niranjan'

499
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:13,660
It's a beautiful world 'Alakh' you can't see that. Niranjan means it is without any amusement

500
01:01:15,020 --> 01:01:22,620
That's the one is the Spirit of the Holy Ghost, we can say, the power of the Holy Ghost which is around us

501
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:30,880
and when the Spirit comes and it is enlightened, we can feel that power flowing through our Central Nervous system.

502
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:40,060
So there's a word called as 'Budh' from where 'Buddha' has come - meaning to know 'Bodh'

503
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:46,660
means to know on your finger-tips, to know on your Central Nervous system. It is not just lecture,

504
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:55,760
it's not just creating a sign of a red, 'O, I'm a Christian, I'm a Hindu or I'm a Muslim or I'm a twice born.'

505
01:01:56,900 --> 01:02:03,240
A person who is a twice born, is a person who is a realized soul whose

506
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:08,380
Spirit is emitting vibrations on

507
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:13,200
the nerves through the Central Nervous system.

508
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:21,800
It's so close to Science, it's so simple with the Science and when this starts happening

509
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:29,800
then you get this [UNCLEAR], you can call this Self-knowledge. Also in Sanskrit there is one word called Veda

510
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:36,000
from where the Vedas are written. Ved means Vid, Vid means to know on Central Nervous system

511
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:43,600
First stanza of Vedas is that, 'If reading all this,

512
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:52,300
if you do not get it vid of it, means it's known on the Central Nervous system, it's all useless.

513
01:02:53,860 --> 01:03:00,400
Shankaracharya has said very clearly, ''Oh Mother! take me out of this

514
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:09,480
webs of words.'' He called it 'Shabdjalam' - out of this webs of words.

515
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:15,020
You go on reading, reading, reading and Kabira has said,

516
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:22,780
''Padhi, padhi pandit murakh bhaye.'' - by reading too much even the learned becomes stupid.

517
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:29,780
I used to think, 'What is he talking about, what does that mean? If people read, then how can they become stupid?''

518
01:03:30,460 --> 01:03:38,120
Because others go into your head. It's the knowledge of the other people in your head - their own brain is finished.

519
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:44,460
Well, I've met many like that over read people. They just go on talking, talking, talking.

520
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:49,300
God knows what they are talking - incoherently sometimes.

521
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:55,200
So whatever these people have said, I have seen and I've seen in people happen

522
01:03:55,760 --> 01:04:03,200
but I've seen something more in these modern times that spontaneously thousands of people get realization

523
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:08,160
It's an enmasse happening - it's not one person giving realization to one person.

524
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:14,280
It's said in the twelfth century in India - there was one,

525
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:23,760
we can call them as one type of seeking. Once somewhere seeking

526
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:29,820
the right side someone left one particular center and they were called as 'Avadhutas' -

527
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:37,640
Machindernath and Gorakhnath, two great people uh..., saints, you see. They went up to Burma, they went to

528
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:44,960
even Russia, they went to uh.. Volimia

529
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:51,640
and these people talked about kundalini. So they know about Kundalini but they don't know how to awaken it

530
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:58,760
and they have run away, these people have run away to Bolivia and all that so it's [UNCLEAR] the knowledge is still [UNCLEAR]

531
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:02,260
in Bolivia [UNCLEAR - SO HIGH UP?].

532
01:05:02,860 --> 01:05:08,000
You can imagine, this knowledge has been there for thousands and thousands of years

533
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:15,400
but has been finished by people who are supposed to be uh.. people in charge of religion;

534
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:21,620
You call them 'Dharma Martand.' They would not accept, they said, 'No, this all nonsense.

535
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:30,120
Even in twelfth century when Gyanadeva, such a great poet, wrote about it in the sixth chapter of his book,

536
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:36,320
they said, ''This is something is not to be seen 'nishiddh' - you're not to read this,''

537
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:41,980
because they didn't want people to have this true knowledge because if they have true knowledge

538
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:45,520
the existence of all these type of people will disappear

539
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:51,200
and then how will they manage because they are money-making or power-oriented,

540
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:55,600
so how will they gain? This was the purpose of

541
01:05:55,960 --> 01:06:00,340
deleting all this knowledge completely from human existence.

542
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:08,360
Now, when I start talking about it, people say it's a cult. I don't know how it is a cult when it has been described [UNCLEAR]

543
01:06:10,620 --> 01:06:15,760
It has to be experienced, works no doubt.

544
01:06:16,780 --> 01:06:24,100
So, the first of all, as I told you, that you get rid of your sicknesses, your illnesses, your physical illnesses.

545
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:28,980
Doctors are easiest to come to sahaja yog because they see

546
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:33,820
the difference between the treatment of sahaja yoga and treatment of anything.

547
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:41,580
We have definitely cured cancer, definitely cured cancer, definitely cured also AIDS, no doubt

548
01:06:42,060 --> 01:06:46,540
but the problem with AIDS people are they're thinking they are martyrs

549
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:53,560
and they're formed in groups of people that they are great martyrs, you know such a martyr - now how can you cure them?

550
01:06:55,160 --> 01:07:02,700
They are under a wrong impression that they are dying, like martyrs they're dying; They have flags and they have big, big

551
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:07,500
[UNCLEAR] everywhere - what can you do to such people?

552
01:07:09,660 --> 01:07:15,240
But it can cure most of your illnesses - most.

553
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:20,240
I wouldn't say guarantee because maybe, some may not receive it

554
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:30,260
This is the first thing that happens that physically you get cured. Mentally - mentally also many diseases have been cured.

555
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:36,440
We have more mental diseases than we have physical.

556
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:45,840
They're saying, in America very soon there will be 65% people suffering from Schizophrenia - can you imagine?

557
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:51,420
What are we going to do in that country 65% people are suffering

558
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:55,640
but when I tell them they don't want to believe.

559
01:07:57,380 --> 01:08:03,180
Why not? Because you don't have to pay anything, you are not given any medicine -

560
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:07,420
nothing. You are cured through sahaja yoga treatment.

561
01:08:09,380 --> 01:08:12,800
Why not go and see that, see for yourself.

562
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:19,420
But the whole medical science depends on how much money you earn naturally;

563
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:23,400
Because we don't earn any money so people don't like us.

564
01:08:25,540 --> 01:08:30,840
It's very funny thing but it is happening.

565
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:36,220
Then, all your emotional problems are solved.

566
01:08:37,460 --> 01:08:44,440
We have had marriages after marriages every year I don't know how many are married and every year at least, hundred

567
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:51,580
are married in India, also in Russia. About 1% people get divorced -

568
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:59,080
that we don't mind. Divorce is important if it is absolutely [UNCLEAR]

569
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:06,160
If it's troubles each other, it's alright. But only 1%, at the most,

570
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:14,560
people take divorce and they have children who are extremely talented, beautiful, loving,

571
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:19,560
respecting - they are out of the blue beautiful children

572
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:29,640
and at a very young age they prosper so we started school in Dharamshala. There's a place

573
01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:36,180
in India where it is nice and good and normally in India people have good schools

574
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:41,800
away from  the madding crowd of the cities and villages.

575
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:49,540
You'll be amazed to know, that in the Matriculation exam that we have, which is a very difficult

576
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:57,320
exam, I think, compared to any other country, in India, the first person,

577
01:09:58,860 --> 01:10:03,020
first of first in the whole of India, was from our school

578
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:08,440
and all the children who appeared for that exam, got first class.

579
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:17,720
To get first class in that examination, is very difficult because it's not an ordinary type of course

580
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:24,920
and imagine, this girl got first class first in the whole of the country -

581
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:33,240
how? And she is American, both parents are American.

582
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:40,860
It's very surprising how it has happened but because your creativity improves,

583
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:44,700
your retention power improves, your memory improves

584
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:53,080
and your attention itself becomes so pure that you don't go on seeing things which are useless,

585
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:58,240
you don't waste your energy, you only see things which give you joy.

586
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:06,820
Your attention is so, so sharp and so loving;

587
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:16,520
It is attention that works everything. Imagine this attention which is hovering here and there and wasting it's energy

588
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:23,180
and all the energy of the body - this attention becomes so sharp

589
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:28,840
and so loving that it goes to places wherever it is required.

590
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:38,160
Because it's Absolute knowledge, the attention itself becomes Absolute. Whatever your attention will tell, is the fact.

591
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:46,680
Now how do you get the attention on your finger-tips [UNCLEAR]? You can feel on your finger-tips which center is out of

592
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:56,560
caring, which is in jeopardy. You immediately feel on your finger-tips, you yourself become the detector

593
01:11:56,820 --> 01:12:02,020
[PLEASE THERE - AFTER THE LECTURE, ALRIGHT?]

594
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:11,420
So, you yourself automatically know what's the matter with you, on your finger-tips - you have Self-knowledge.

595
01:12:12,220 --> 01:12:20,240
Now you don't get worried and upset, you take sahaja yoga treatment, you're alright, your chakras are alright, are cleaned out, centers are perfect.

596
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:28,680
Then you can also feel others so you can know what's wrong with the others.

597
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:35,160
Now there are many I know here in this country also in America all over because you're well off

598
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:42,120
people in search of money come here as big gurus and I don't know what they call themselves.

599
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:50,380
Some of them just have changed and wearing saffron clothes they have no [UNCLEAR] about them

600
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:57,560
and they say say we're [UNCLEAR], we're this, we're that and people are so simple they believe them.

601
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:03,720
And so many have minted money. There's one in now in America

602
01:13:12,980 --> 01:13:19,200
And he gives some sort of a pendulum to move then you can move the pendulum [UNCLEAR]

603
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:26,800
But what upset Me was that, so many people have sold their houses, taken out their children from school

604
01:13:27,020 --> 01:13:31,720
and are suffering so much, so much money [UNCLEAR]

605
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:39,080
So, one has to understand that Absolute truth is to be

606
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:45,760
felt on your Central Nervous system; It is an experience,

607
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:53,020
it is a becoming, you become something. For example,

608
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:58,580
in Sanskrit a realized soul is called as 'Dwijah' - born again

609
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:07,080
and a bird is also called a dwijah because bird is an egg

610
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:14,500
and then it becomes a bird. In the same way we are in the web of our conditioning and ego

611
01:14:15,180 --> 01:14:22,920
but this egg opens up and we grow our wings and complete freedom,

612
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:28,800
complete freedom because you're by freedom you never do wrong things,

613
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:33,580
you'll not do anything that is destructive to yourself and to others.

614
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:42,380
I mean, it's something they talk of religion as if you have become religion or you are beyond religion,

615
01:14:42,980 --> 01:14:50,520
you don't need religion - you are religion. That's the state you get and is already described in so many books

616
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:59,480
but we don't understand because it's said sometimes it is in poetry, sometimes in abstract way but you become religious.

617
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:12,480
So first state comes to us when these thoughts are all hovering on our head, when the Kundalini rises She elongates this

618
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:19,040
these thoughts and in between is the bliss of peace

619
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:26,300
where you don't think. In Sanskrit it is called 'Nirvichaar Samaadhi'

620
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:35,300
We can call it thoughtless awareness - you're  completely aware but you are thoughtless, without any thoughts.

621
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:42,240
If you want to think, you can think but if you don't want to think, you need not think.

622
01:15:42,660 --> 01:15:50,120
It is fantastical - you become so peaceful that you do not react - reaction goes away

623
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:55,680
That's how family life, national life - everything can be improved.

624
01:15:56,680 --> 01:16:03,600
And when you see something, see I see this beautiful carpet here so I don't think, I just watch

625
01:16:04,140 --> 01:16:11,320
because if I start thinking, I'll think how much it is, who's it is -  if  it is mine, I'll be worried it - I should ensure it and all sorts of things.

626
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:20,300
But if there is no thought, I just watch and the joy of the artist

627
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:26,440
which is in this carpet starts in an abstract way starts flowing and starts [UNCLEAR] Me.

628
01:16:27,860 --> 01:16:33,960
Really beautiful things when you see, don't have to think and the whole thing becomes like a

629
01:16:34,580 --> 01:16:37,860
peace giving apparatus.

630
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:45,800
Feel so tranquil and so peace and this modern disease that has come of stress and strain disappears.

631
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:49,140
Absolutely disappears.

632
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:59,520
There is no stress, there is no strain because this has opened now, everything passes out.

633
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:05,020
But at the same time the problem gets solved - how?

634
01:17:05,540 --> 01:17:11,460
Supposing you are standing in the water, then you are afraid of the waves that are rising

635
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:20,000
but supposing that you get into the boat, then you watch. You watch

636
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:27,140
and enjoy also. Enjoying [UNCLEAR] waves don't trouble.

637
01:17:28,260 --> 01:17:31,900
Then what do you do? Supposing you learn swimming.

638
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:37,220
Swim, go down and save many others who are getting completely lost.

639
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:45,560
This happens to you as a matter of your powers - you become that, you become that powerful

640
01:17:49,020 --> 01:17:55,240
and the second great thing that happens is that you become collectively conscious - samoohik.

641
01:17:56,160 --> 01:18:03,400
Like on the fingers [UNCLEAR] you can feel others. Who is the other then?

642
01:18:05,240 --> 01:18:11,900
You become part and parcel of the whole; The microcosm becomes the macrocosm.

643
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:19,040
It is said, said but now you become again part and parcel of the whole and the whole looks after you.

644
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:27,840
It gives you such a protection that you are amazed.

645
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:36,140
Recently there was an accident in Philadelphia - [UNCLEAR - FOUR?] sahaja yogis [UNCLEAR] were travelling and the car was crashed.

646
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:42,840
They came back to New York with tears in their eyes, I said, ''What happened?'' ''Mother, You have protected us.'' ''Why?''

647
01:18:43,540 --> 01:18:49,560
Not a scratch on their body and many such things have happened. So many of miracles

648
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:57,040
that now miracle has lost it's meaning really. I told somebody that you better write down all these miracles because I don't have time

649
01:18:57,720 --> 01:19:05,680
so within one month he had it up to his head, above his head both the sides papers. He said, ''Mother, I don't know what to write what not to write

650
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:13,600
so You better go through this.'' I said, ''I have no time, I don't have time so leave it, it's alright., let them enjoy the miracles.''

651
01:19:14,420 --> 01:19:19,880
But there is this Divine power, Divine power of love.

652
01:19:21,820 --> 01:19:27,020
We need not believe. You're going to feel it today - tonight you're going to feel that power

653
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:34,260
and once you feel it you have to just know how to use it. So you become collectively conscious

654
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:41,960
and when you become collectively conscious, no fight [UNCLEAR], no; You don't fight, you don't react.

655
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:49,400
There is no need to preach about peace at all;

656
01:19:50,220 --> 01:19:57,620
Also giving peace uh.. awards. People get peace awards - I've seen them and met them

657
01:19:57,820 --> 01:20:05,400
then how their horribly hot-tempers have reached, I don't know how they are saying that they have got peace - where?

658
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:13,980
Peace should be within us and once this transformation takes place in human-beings, there will be no war,

659
01:20:14,860 --> 01:20:20,480
there will be no problem of any kind with another person, with another human-being.

660
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:29,460
You enjoy each other. Now, as I told you we have 65 nations who are in sahaja yoga,

661
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:37,320
who are working out sahaja yoga. Some nations are very powerful, say, Russia; It's very powerful.

662
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:45,880
Thousands and thousands Russians - maybe because of oppression of the Communism,

663
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:54,100
maybe they didn't know anything about religion and - I don't know how to explain but I was amazed. I went

664
01:20:54,280 --> 01:21:01,760
to Leningrad first where two thousand people inside because for the hall they have to pay - not Me but hall

665
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:07,440
and there were two thousand people sitting inside, two thousand outside. I said,

666
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:14,740
there was not [UNCLEAR] just My photographs were here and there so, then they said -

667
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:22,240
they learnt something in Hindi also, said, ''Ma, what about us?'' I said, ''Alright, I will, I'll come back.''

668
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:28,480
After the program when I came they were all there sitting down, so I said, ''Alright, you come along tomorrow.

669
01:21:29,940 --> 01:21:37,620
We'll wait here, there's lot of open space, you don't have to book hall.'' So they came. They came,

670
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:44,340
two thousand from inside came, outside two thousand came and two thousand their friends also

671
01:21:46,260 --> 01:21:54,280
and six thousand of them, they got their realization and they just settled down in it; they're not shifty.

672
01:21:55,660 --> 01:22:00,520
That's what I find. I don't know America even Canada.

673
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:09,000
If your mind is shifty like that then you cannot grow, cannot mature. But they had this problem of oppression

674
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:17,500
and no talk of religion, no talk about sex. They were so clean people and so deep

675
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:24,600
I was surprised all of them settled down. There're thousands and thousands there now.

676
01:22:25,660 --> 01:22:31,380
There's a joke about it
