00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:11.944
Today we have gathered here to do Puja to Bhairavnath.

00:00:13.152 --> 00:00:16.997
I think we have not understood

00:00:17.149 --> 00:00:22.645
the significance of Bhairavnath

00:00:22.805 --> 00:00:32.488
who runs, and up and down on the Ida Nadi.

00:01:02.538 --> 00:01:09.374
Ida Nadi is the Nadi of Chandrama, is of the moon.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:25.240
So, this is a channel for us to cool down.

00:01:32.056 --> 00:01:39.934
So the work of Bhairavnathji is to cool us down.

00:01:45.837 --> 00:01:50.307
For example, people have a hot temper,

00:01:50.467 --> 00:01:54.740
with their ego, with their liver, whatever it is.

00:02:03.208 --> 00:02:10.227
And if a person is in a big temper,

00:02:10.387 --> 00:02:16.239
then Bhairavnath plays tricks on that person

00:02:16.444 --> 00:02:18.995
to cool him down.

00:02:27.327 --> 00:02:34.344
He organises everything under his own control

00:02:34.504 --> 00:02:37.838
with ganas help, with Ganapati's help,

00:02:37.998 --> 00:02:42.864
to cool down your temperament, to give you a balance.

00:02:55.264 --> 00:02:59.336
So, if somebody is a very hot-tempered person,

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:05.517
and he crosses all the limits of his temper,

00:03:05.677 --> 00:03:08.282
then somehow or other,

00:03:08.442 --> 00:03:11.532
Bhairavnath will organize,

00:03:11.692 --> 00:03:14.809
also with the help of Hanumana,

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:21.209
to show that this stupidity of anger is no good.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.846
So, for example, people who are depressed

00:03:48.006 --> 00:03:50.641
or who become left-sided,

00:03:50.801 --> 00:03:56.767
Hanumana tries to help them to come out of it.

00:03:56.927 --> 00:04:03.127
No doubt, but also Bhairavnath helps them

00:04:03.287 --> 00:04:07.246
very much more to come out of it.

00:04:19.652 --> 00:04:27.610
Now, a person who is left-sided cannot be collective.

00:04:32.415 --> 00:04:35.629
It is very difficult for a person

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:39.514
who is very left-sided,

00:04:39.674 --> 00:04:45.427
who is all the time feeling very sad,

00:04:45.587 --> 00:04:48.863
unhappy and worried,

00:04:49.023 --> 00:04:53.068
cannot enjoy the fun of collectivity.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.096
While a hot-tempered person, a right-sided person,

00:05:09.256 --> 00:05:11.533
does not enjoy any collectivity,

00:05:11.693 --> 00:05:14.186
doesn't allow anybody to enjoy collectivity, no doubt,

00:05:14.346 --> 00:05:19.414
but tries to be in the collective that it can assert.

00:05:33.916 --> 00:05:37.146
Because such a person tries to show the superiority,

00:05:37.306 --> 00:05:39.169
is something superior.

00:05:39.329 --> 00:05:44.633
Naturally he cannot enjoy the collective.

00:05:53.148 --> 00:05:57.349
On the contrary, the person who is depressed,

00:05:57.509 --> 00:05:59.496
all the time thinks,

00:05:59.656 --> 00:06:02.253
"Nobody loves me, nobody cares for me,

00:06:02.413 --> 00:06:04.503
I'm so depressed," this, that,

00:06:04.663 --> 00:06:07.807
all the time expecting from others something,

00:06:07.967 --> 00:06:13.260
also cannot enjoy the collective.

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.332
Such a left-sided person will find

00:06:33.492 --> 00:06:39.915
everything is something unhappy.

00:06:48.134 --> 00:06:50.788
Like the other day, I went to Moscow.

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:55.014
There was a lady with us who was a Sahaja Yogini,

00:06:55.174 --> 00:06:58.580
left-sided Sahaja Yogini.

00:07:05.653 --> 00:07:08.995
So, we went to have our food

00:07:09.155 --> 00:07:14.101
and it started raining and they couldn't get a taxi,

00:07:22.368 --> 00:07:25.925
but then a car came in and we went there.

00:07:30.214 --> 00:07:33.027
Then they said that

00:07:33.187 --> 00:07:36.315
"You are very late so you have to sit on the other side,

00:07:36.475 --> 00:07:40.440
you have to take the seats which were more expensive."

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:51.561
So this lady started saying,

00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:56.844
"What all problems, no taxi, it is raining

00:07:57.004 --> 00:08:00.236
and we can't get a seat."

00:08:10.061 --> 00:08:12.139
I said, "This is all fun;

00:08:12.299 --> 00:08:14.728
this is not something a problem."

00:08:14.888 --> 00:08:18.457
This 'problema' word should be given up.

00:08:27.279 --> 00:08:29.927
This is a new word I have learned,

00:08:30.087 --> 00:08:34.436
because 'problem' we used to use only for geometry

00:08:34.596 --> 00:08:36.860
in our young age.

00:08:47.358 --> 00:08:50.877
Now, this sort of a attitude, negative attitude,

00:08:51.037 --> 00:08:53.826
to find everything negative

00:08:53.986 --> 00:09:00.307
is the way we really spoil our left side.

00:09:09.356 --> 00:09:11.954
But then a gentleman who had invited us came

00:09:12.114 --> 00:09:17.681
and he said, "We are sitting on the other side waiting for you.'

00:09:27.459 --> 00:09:30.117
So we went to the other side, enjoyed nice food,

00:09:30.277 --> 00:09:31.687
everything was fine.

00:09:31.847 --> 00:09:34.111
I said, "See now, you were only counting

00:09:34.271 --> 00:09:38.503
how many negative things there are,

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:49.741
and you were not seeing the fun."

00:09:55.243 --> 00:09:57.161
So she asked Me, "What should I do?" I said,

00:09:57.321 --> 00:10:00.449
"You take Bhairava's name,

00:10:05.048 --> 00:10:07.036
sit with your left hand towards the photograph

00:10:07.196 --> 00:10:08.923
and right hand on the Mother Earth

00:10:09.083 --> 00:10:13.128
and that's how all your bhoots of negativity will go away."

00:10:19.719 --> 00:10:22.957
So, Bhairava is, always has a light in His hand,

00:10:23.117 --> 00:10:26.247
always light in His hand.

00:10:31.233 --> 00:10:34.896
And He runs up and down

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:42.186
Ida Nadi to make light for you to see that there's nothing negative.

00:10:49.377 --> 00:10:54.044
And this negativity comes to us by many ways.

00:10:58.022 --> 00:11:01.974
One of the negativities are that,

00:11:02.134 --> 00:11:05.451
"This is mine",

00:11:09.095 --> 00:11:18.817
like, "My child, my husband, my property, my ..."

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:26.093
So then, you see, once you get attached

00:11:26.253 --> 00:11:29.432
in this manner, what you find,

00:11:29.592 --> 00:11:35.827
that your children also become negative.

00:11:41.736 --> 00:11:49.565
But if you want to be positive, it is very easy.

00:11:52.918 --> 00:11:58.342
And for that you should see, 'Where is your attention?"

00:12:01.702 --> 00:12:04.277
Are you only seeing problema

00:12:04.437 --> 00:12:08.612
or you are seeing some fun in it?

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:22.583
There are people who cannot make fun out of anything.

00:12:25.735 --> 00:12:32.009
If it's a sunny day they'll cry, "Oh God, what a sunny day!"

00:12:36.953 --> 00:12:41.524
and if it is a day with clouds they will say,

00:12:41.684 --> 00:12:43.756
"Oh, what a day!"

00:12:47.635 --> 00:12:50.681
Nothing can please them.

00:12:51.942 --> 00:12:58.144
But to enjoy the positivity in every negativity

00:12:58.304 --> 00:13:01.869
is the capacity of a Sahaja Yogi.

00:13:09.152 --> 00:13:15.720
The negativity doesn't exist - it's an ignorance.

00:13:18.285 --> 00:13:21.873
Also, it's not ignorance, because ignorance also doesn't exist.

00:13:22.033 --> 00:13:25.231
If everything is the All-Pervading Power,

00:13:25.391 --> 00:13:29.547
then how can there be ignorance?

00:13:35.447 --> 00:13:41.891
But supposing, in the folds of this power,

00:13:42.051 --> 00:13:44.328
if you hide, run away,

00:13:44.488 --> 00:13:48.715
you will say that there is negativity.

00:13:56.053 --> 00:13:58.204
Like, you hide yourself in a cave,

00:13:58.364 --> 00:14:03.769
close it properly, and say that there is no sun.

00:14:08.729 --> 00:14:13.158
So those people who cannot become collective,

00:14:13.318 --> 00:14:19.254
are either right-sided or left- sided but more left-sided.

00:14:26.998 --> 00:14:33.840
But left- sided people can be collective in negativity.

00:14:38.592 --> 00:14:42.724
They say, there is a very big fraternity of bhoots.

00:14:45.137 --> 00:14:51.578
Ah, you see some drunkards sitting together.

00:14:54.654 --> 00:14:59.801
They are saying, "See there're so many problem, ecological problem."

00:14:59.961 --> 00:15:02.100
They are drunkards, all drunk,

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:06.106
and "There are problems of so other kinds.

00:15:06.266 --> 00:15:10.331
When will this end?"

00:15:19.773 --> 00:15:22.275
So the another one says, "Wait, wait, wait.

00:15:22.435 --> 00:15:27.524
I've heard that the whole world is going to collapse very soon."

00:15:37.626 --> 00:15:38.962
Then the third one says,

00:15:39.122 --> 00:15:43.396
"Thank God! We are going to be collapsed, finished."

00:15:45.926 --> 00:15:52.899
Then fourth one says, "But what will happen to our pubs?"

00:15:57.324 --> 00:16:03.509
They say, "It's all right. If we are not existing, what does it matter?"

00:16:06.752 --> 00:16:12.665
That's how the fraternity of the bhoots act.

00:16:14.202 --> 00:16:16.755
They cannot see fun at all,

00:16:16.823 --> 00:16:20.108
they cannot enjoy at all,

00:16:23.497 --> 00:16:25.951
and they become very,

00:16:26.055 --> 00:16:28.525
sort of think they are very meditative,

00:16:28.661 --> 00:16:32.491
they are some higher people, they are something superior

00:16:32.477 --> 00:16:35.621
in negativity.

00:16:47.643 --> 00:16:52.742
But, end of these people is that they become lunatics,

00:16:55.545 --> 00:17:01.303
while the end of the right-sided - they become idiotic.

00:17:05.279 --> 00:17:09.233
Once I went to a lunatic asylum,

00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:14.875
and while going there I met a lady,

00:17:15.035 --> 00:17:17.743
and she was quite all right, I mean,

00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:20.268
I thought she was a quite all right woman,

00:17:20.356 --> 00:17:23.652
so I started talking to her.

00:17:31.335 --> 00:17:33.344
And she started talking very wisely:

00:17:33.504 --> 00:17:35.883
"See, my brother- in- law is there, and

00:17:36.043 --> 00:17:39.362
I think it isn't necessary that he should be helped,

00:17:39.522 --> 00:17:41.229
and we should not do this, that..."

00:17:41.389 --> 00:17:45.486
All kinds of things she was telling Me,

00:17:53.097 --> 00:17:56.617
showing Me, as if she was very nice and kind

00:17:56.662 --> 00:18:00.234
and no one loves her.

00:18:06.297 --> 00:18:10.228
And she said, "I'm very insecure" and this and that.

00:18:13.872 --> 00:18:17.756
Suddenly the doctor came in

00:18:18.189 --> 00:18:21.767
and she started abusing him, shouting at him.

00:18:21.927 --> 00:18:25.113
I said, "What's this?"

00:18:31.749 --> 00:18:34.551
So the doctor sent for people that,

00:18:34.711 --> 00:18:36.260
"Catch hold of this woman!"

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:40.594
He told Me, "She's the most violent lunatic

00:18:47.006 --> 00:18:49.737
and why are You talking to her?"

00:18:50.419 --> 00:18:56.261
I did have a headache but I didn't know she was a lunatic.

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:03.145
Maybe in My presence, her bhoots might have a little bit

00:19:03.305 --> 00:19:05.363
run away and were playing tricks,

00:19:05.523 --> 00:19:10.092
but you can see that, clearly.

00:19:16.009 --> 00:19:18.589
So, this emotional attachment is too much,

00:19:18.749 --> 00:19:22.639
and to emotionally, to worry about somebody, that

00:19:22.799 --> 00:19:27.317
"You see, "This is my child, this is my this thing,

00:19:27.477 --> 00:19:29.153
this is this and this is that,"

00:19:29.313 --> 00:19:31.961
and all the time wasting your precious life

00:19:32.121 --> 00:19:37.252
in these things is not the way a Sahaja Yogi should live.

00:19:48.148 --> 00:19:50.498
If a Sahaja Yogi cannot become collective,

00:19:50.658 --> 00:19:54.438
then know that he is not a Sahaja Yogi.

00:20:00.904 --> 00:20:02.595
So, one has to know that

00:20:02.755 --> 00:20:06.942
this is the work of Bhairavnath within us.

00:20:10.306 --> 00:20:13.961
Another work that He gives us light in darkness is that,

00:20:14.121 --> 00:20:21.261
that He, He destroys all the bhoots within us.

00:20:27.425 --> 00:20:30.721
And all kinds of bhootish ideas

00:20:32.246 --> 00:20:37.000
and funny ideas about attachments

00:20:40.442 --> 00:20:43.772
and also the depressiveness.

00:20:45.427 --> 00:20:46.982
So, today we are, I am very happy

00:20:47.142 --> 00:20:50.882
that we are worshipping Shri Bhairava

00:20:51.042 --> 00:20:56.410
because He is very much connected with Ganesha.

00:21:02.298 --> 00:21:05.800
As you know Shri Ganesha is at the Mooladhara

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:10.069
and while Bhairava moves onto the left side

00:21:10.229 --> 00:21:14.253
and goes to the right side.

00:21:20.757 --> 00:21:25.165
So, all kinds of conditionings, all kinds of habits,

00:21:25.325 --> 00:21:32.018
can be conquered through the help of Bhairavnath.

00:21:39.608 --> 00:21:44.745
In Nepal we have a very huge, big Bhairavnath’s statue

00:21:44.905 --> 00:21:48.806
which is really Swayambhu.

00:21:52.569 --> 00:21:55.084
And people are more left-sided,

00:21:55.244 --> 00:21:58.810
so they are afraid of Bhairavnath.

00:22:02.889 --> 00:22:06.774
So, if somebody has a bad habit, say, of stealing,

00:22:06.934 --> 00:22:09.641
they take him to the, to in front of Bhairavnath

00:22:09.801 --> 00:22:15.186
and put His light there, make a flame.

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:26.018
I mean, the police takes them.

00:22:26.131 --> 00:22:32.510
And then they ask him, "Now, say before Bhairavnath, confess it."

00:22:37.833 --> 00:22:42.899
And they confess what wrong they have done.

00:22:43.059 --> 00:22:52.751
So, He protect us, also from doing wrong things,

00:22:52.858 --> 00:22:56.412
sly things like thieving.

00:23:03.885 --> 00:23:06.947
Whatever we think we can do secretly, can be hidden,

00:23:07.107 --> 00:23:11.340
but you cannot hide it from Bhairavnath.

00:23:17.672 --> 00:23:22.750
If you don't change, then He exposes you completely.

00:23:25.414 --> 00:23:31.298
That's how He has exposed  all the horrible false gurus.

00:23:35.107 --> 00:23:39.219
So, today we are here to worship

00:23:39.379 --> 00:23:41.821
this great Deity of Bhiaravnatha

00:23:41.981 --> 00:23:46.554
who incarnated on this earth later on,

00:23:54.513 --> 00:23:58.021
ultimately as Mahavira also.

00:23:59.155 --> 00:24:03.913
So, He stands on the gate of hell

00:24:06.858 --> 00:24:10.959
and stops people from falling into hell.

00:24:15.482 --> 00:24:17.881
But if you want to go to hell,

00:24:18.041 --> 00:24:21.169
if it is your desire, is your willpower like that working,

00:24:21.329 --> 00:24:22.876
that I should go to hell, then He says,

00:24:23.036 --> 00:24:26.925
'All right, you can go.'

00:24:33.166 --> 00:24:39.636
But as you know, now the hell is also full of people.

00:24:43.455 --> 00:24:49.537
So, it’s better that we should try to fight our negativity

00:24:49.697 --> 00:24:56.601
and become fun-loving, enjoying others, loving others,

00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:12.922
not worrying about what others are doing to you,

00:25:13.082 --> 00:25:18.346
but only thinking what good you can do to others.

00:25:27.376 --> 00:25:34.828
So today's special Puja for Bhairavnath we offer,

00:25:37.861 --> 00:25:44.991
to give us a sense to laugh, to enjoy, to have fun.

00:25:53.549 --> 00:25:57.119
May God bless you all.
