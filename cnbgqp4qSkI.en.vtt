WEBVTT

00:01.240 --> 00:11.944
Today we have gathered here to do Puja to Bhairavnath.

00:13.152 --> 00:16.997
I think we have not understood

00:17.149 --> 00:22.645
the significance of Bhairavnath

00:22.805 --> 00:32.488
who runs, and up and down on the Ida Nadi.

01:02.538 --> 01:09.374
Ida Nadi is the Nadi of Chandrama, is of the moon.

01:14.800 --> 01:25.240
So, this is a channel for us to cool down.

01:32.056 --> 01:39.934
So the work of Bhairavnathji is to cool us down.

01:45.837 --> 01:50.307
For example, people have a hot temper,

01:50.467 --> 01:54.740
with their ego, with their liver, whatever it is.

02:03.208 --> 02:10.227
And if a person is in a big temper,

02:10.387 --> 02:16.239
then Bhairavnath plays tricks on that person

02:16.444 --> 02:18.995
to cool him down.

02:27.327 --> 02:34.344
He organises everything under his own control

02:34.504 --> 02:37.838
with ganas help, with Ganapati's help,

02:37.998 --> 02:42.864
to cool down your temperament, to give you a balance.

02:55.264 --> 02:59.336
So, if somebody is a very hot-tempered person,

03:00.039 --> 03:05.517
and he crosses all the limits of his temper,

03:05.677 --> 03:08.282
then somehow or other,

03:08.442 --> 03:11.532
Bhairavnath will organize,

03:11.692 --> 03:14.809
also with the help of Hanumana,

03:14.969 --> 03:21.209
to show that this stupidity of anger is no good.

03:42.760 --> 03:47.846
So, for example, people who are depressed

03:48.006 --> 03:50.641
or who become left-sided,

03:50.801 --> 03:56.767
Hanumana tries to help them to come out of it.

03:56.927 --> 04:03.127
No doubt, but also Bhairavnath helps them

04:03.287 --> 04:07.246
very much more to come out of it.

04:19.652 --> 04:27.610
Now, a person who is left-sided cannot be collective.

04:32.415 --> 04:35.629
It is very difficult for a person

04:35.789 --> 04:39.514
who is very left-sided,

04:39.674 --> 04:45.427
who is all the time feeling very sad,

04:45.587 --> 04:48.863
unhappy and worried,

04:49.023 --> 04:53.068
cannot enjoy the fun of collectivity.

05:05.580 --> 05:09.096
While a hot-tempered person, a right-sided person,

05:09.256 --> 05:11.533
does not enjoy any collectivity,

05:11.693 --> 05:14.186
doesn't allow anybody to enjoy collectivity, no doubt,

05:14.346 --> 05:19.414
but tries to be in the collective that it can assert.

05:33.916 --> 05:37.146
Because such a person tries to show the superiority,

05:37.306 --> 05:39.169
is something superior.

05:39.329 --> 05:44.633
Naturally he cannot enjoy the collective.

05:53.148 --> 05:57.349
On the contrary, the person who is depressed,

05:57.509 --> 05:59.496
all the time thinks,

05:59.656 --> 06:02.253
"Nobody loves me, nobody cares for me,

06:02.413 --> 06:04.503
I'm so depressed," this, that,

06:04.663 --> 06:07.807
all the time expecting from others something,

06:07.967 --> 06:13.260
also cannot enjoy the collective.

06:31.010 --> 06:33.332
Such a left-sided person will find

06:33.492 --> 06:39.915
everything is something unhappy.

06:48.134 --> 06:50.788
Like the other day, I went to Moscow.

06:50.940 --> 06:55.014
There was a lady with us who was a Sahaja Yogini,

06:55.174 --> 06:58.580
left-sided Sahaja Yogini.

07:05.653 --> 07:08.995
So, we went to have our food

07:09.155 --> 07:14.101
and it started raining and they couldn't get a taxi,

07:22.368 --> 07:25.925
but then a car came in and we went there.

07:30.214 --> 07:33.027
Then they said that

07:33.187 --> 07:36.315
"You are very late so you have to sit on the other side,

07:36.475 --> 07:40.440
you have to take the seats which were more expensive."

07:49.740 --> 07:51.561
So this lady started saying,

07:51.721 --> 07:56.844
"What all problems, no taxi, it is raining

07:57.004 --> 08:00.236
and we can't get a seat."

08:10.061 --> 08:12.139
I said, "This is all fun;

08:12.299 --> 08:14.728
this is not something a problem."

08:14.888 --> 08:18.457
This 'problema' word should be given up.

08:27.279 --> 08:29.927
This is a new word I have learned,

08:30.087 --> 08:34.436
because 'problem' we used to use only for geometry

08:34.596 --> 08:36.860
in our young age.

08:47.358 --> 08:50.877
Now, this sort of a attitude, negative attitude,

08:51.037 --> 08:53.826
to find everything negative

08:53.986 --> 09:00.307
is the way we really spoil our left side.

09:09.356 --> 09:11.954
But then a gentleman who had invited us came

09:12.114 --> 09:17.681
and he said, "We are sitting on the other side waiting for you.'

09:27.459 --> 09:30.117
So we went to the other side, enjoyed nice food,

09:30.277 --> 09:31.687
everything was fine.

09:31.847 --> 09:34.111
I said, "See now, you were only counting

09:34.271 --> 09:38.503
how many negative things there are,

09:46.040 --> 09:49.741
and you were not seeing the fun."

09:55.243 --> 09:57.161
So she asked Me, "What should I do?" I said,

09:57.321 --> 10:00.449
"You take Bhairava's name,

10:05.048 --> 10:07.036
sit with your left hand towards the photograph

10:07.196 --> 10:08.923
and right hand on the Mother Earth

10:09.083 --> 10:13.128
and that's how all your bhoots of negativity will go away."

10:19.719 --> 10:22.957
So, Bhairava is, always has a light in His hand,

10:23.117 --> 10:26.247
always light in His hand.

10:31.233 --> 10:34.896
And He runs up and down

10:35.340 --> 10:42.186
Ida Nadi to make light for you to see that there's nothing negative.

10:49.377 --> 10:54.044
And this negativity comes to us by many ways.

10:58.022 --> 11:01.974
One of the negativities are that,

11:02.134 --> 11:05.451
"This is mine",

11:09.095 --> 11:18.817
like, "My child, my husband, my property, my ..."

11:23.760 --> 11:26.093
So then, you see, once you get attached

11:26.253 --> 11:29.432
in this manner, what you find,

11:29.592 --> 11:35.827
that your children also become negative.

11:41.736 --> 11:49.565
But if you want to be positive, it is very easy.

11:52.918 --> 11:58.342
And for that you should see, 'Where is your attention?"

12:01.702 --> 12:04.277
Are you only seeing problema

12:04.437 --> 12:08.612
or you are seeing some fun in it?

12:17.320 --> 12:22.583
There are people who cannot make fun out of anything.

12:25.735 --> 12:32.009
If it's a sunny day they'll cry, "Oh God, what a sunny day!"

12:36.953 --> 12:41.524
and if it is a day with clouds they will say,

12:41.684 --> 12:43.756
"Oh, what a day!"

12:47.635 --> 12:50.681
Nothing can please them.

12:51.942 --> 12:58.144
But to enjoy the positivity in every negativity

12:58.304 --> 13:01.869
is the capacity of a Sahaja Yogi.

13:09.152 --> 13:15.720
The negativity doesn't exist - it's an ignorance.

13:18.285 --> 13:21.873
Also, it's not ignorance, because ignorance also doesn't exist.

13:22.033 --> 13:25.231
If everything is the All-Pervading Power,

13:25.391 --> 13:29.547
then how can there be ignorance?

13:35.447 --> 13:41.891
But supposing, in the folds of this power,

13:42.051 --> 13:44.328
if you hide, run away,

13:44.488 --> 13:48.715
you will say that there is negativity.

13:56.053 --> 13:58.204
Like, you hide yourself in a cave,

13:58.364 --> 14:03.769
close it properly, and say that there is no sun.

14:08.729 --> 14:13.158
So those people who cannot become collective,

14:13.318 --> 14:19.254
are either right-sided or left- sided but more left-sided.

14:26.998 --> 14:33.840
But left- sided people can be collective in negativity.

14:38.592 --> 14:42.724
They say, there is a very big fraternity of bhoots.

14:45.137 --> 14:51.578
Ah, you see some drunkards sitting together.

14:54.654 --> 14:59.801
They are saying, "See there're so many problem, ecological problem."

14:59.961 --> 15:02.100
They are drunkards, all drunk,

15:02.260 --> 15:06.106
and "There are problems of so other kinds.

15:06.266 --> 15:10.331
When will this end?"

15:19.773 --> 15:22.275
So the another one says, "Wait, wait, wait.

15:22.435 --> 15:27.524
I've heard that the whole world is going to collapse very soon."

15:37.626 --> 15:38.962
Then the third one says,

15:39.122 --> 15:43.396
"Thank God! We are going to be collapsed, finished."

15:45.926 --> 15:52.899
Then fourth one says, "But what will happen to our pubs?"

15:57.324 --> 16:03.509
They say, "It's all right. If we are not existing, what does it matter?"

16:06.752 --> 16:12.665
That's how the fraternity of the bhoots act.

16:14.202 --> 16:16.755
They cannot see fun at all,

16:16.823 --> 16:20.108
they cannot enjoy at all,

16:23.497 --> 16:25.951
and they become very,

16:26.055 --> 16:28.525
sort of think they are very meditative,

16:28.661 --> 16:32.491
they are some higher people, they are something superior

16:32.477 --> 16:35.621
in negativity.

16:47.643 --> 16:52.742
But, end of these people is that they become lunatics,

16:55.545 --> 17:01.303
while the end of the right-sided - they become idiotic.

17:05.279 --> 17:09.233
Once I went to a lunatic asylum,

17:11.579 --> 17:14.875
and while going there I met a lady,

17:15.035 --> 17:17.743
and she was quite all right, I mean,

17:17.840 --> 17:20.268
I thought she was a quite all right woman,

17:20.356 --> 17:23.652
so I started talking to her.

17:31.335 --> 17:33.344
And she started talking very wisely:

17:33.504 --> 17:35.883
"See, my brother- in- law is there, and

17:36.043 --> 17:39.362
I think it isn't necessary that he should be helped,

17:39.522 --> 17:41.229
and we should not do this, that..."

17:41.389 --> 17:45.486
All kinds of things she was telling Me,

17:53.097 --> 17:56.617
showing Me, as if she was very nice and kind

17:56.662 --> 18:00.234
and no one loves her.

18:06.297 --> 18:10.228
And she said, "I'm very insecure" and this and that.

18:13.872 --> 18:17.756
Suddenly the doctor came in

18:18.189 --> 18:21.767
and she started abusing him, shouting at him.

18:21.927 --> 18:25.113
I said, "What's this?"

18:31.749 --> 18:34.551
So the doctor sent for people that,

18:34.711 --> 18:36.260
"Catch hold of this woman!"

18:36.420 --> 18:40.594
He told Me, "She's the most violent lunatic

18:47.006 --> 18:49.737
and why are You talking to her?"

18:50.419 --> 18:56.261
I did have a headache but I didn't know she was a lunatic.

19:00.450 --> 19:03.145
Maybe in My presence, her bhoots might have a little bit

19:03.305 --> 19:05.363
run away and were playing tricks,

19:05.523 --> 19:10.092
but you can see that, clearly.

19:16.009 --> 19:18.589
So, this emotional attachment is too much,

19:18.749 --> 19:22.639
and to emotionally, to worry about somebody, that

19:22.799 --> 19:27.317
"You see, "This is my child, this is my this thing,

19:27.477 --> 19:29.153
this is this and this is that,"

19:29.313 --> 19:31.961
and all the time wasting your precious life

19:32.121 --> 19:37.252
in these things is not the way a Sahaja Yogi should live.

19:48.148 --> 19:50.498
If a Sahaja Yogi cannot become collective,

19:50.658 --> 19:54.438
then know that he is not a Sahaja Yogi.

20:00.904 --> 20:02.595
So, one has to know that

20:02.755 --> 20:06.942
this is the work of Bhairavnath within us.

20:10.306 --> 20:13.961
Another work that He gives us light in darkness is that,

20:14.121 --> 20:21.261
that He, He destroys all the bhoots within us.

20:27.425 --> 20:30.721
And all kinds of bhootish ideas

20:32.246 --> 20:37.000
and funny ideas about attachments

20:40.442 --> 20:43.772
and also the depressiveness.

20:45.427 --> 20:46.982
So, today we are, I am very happy

20:47.142 --> 20:50.882
that we are worshipping Shri Bhairava

20:51.042 --> 20:56.410
because He is very much connected with Ganesha.

21:02.298 --> 21:05.800
As you know Shri Ganesha is at the Mooladhara

21:05.960 --> 21:10.069
and while Bhairava moves onto the left side

21:10.229 --> 21:14.253
and goes to the right side.

21:20.757 --> 21:25.165
So, all kinds of conditionings, all kinds of habits,

21:25.325 --> 21:32.018
can be conquered through the help of Bhairavnath.

21:39.608 --> 21:44.745
In Nepal we have a very huge, big Bhairavnath’s statue

21:44.905 --> 21:48.806
which is really Swayambhu.

21:52.569 --> 21:55.084
And people are more left-sided,

21:55.244 --> 21:58.810
so they are afraid of Bhairavnath.

22:02.889 --> 22:06.774
So, if somebody has a bad habit, say, of stealing,

22:06.934 --> 22:09.641
they take him to the, to in front of Bhairavnath

22:09.801 --> 22:15.186
and put His light there, make a flame.

22:24.110 --> 22:26.018
I mean, the police takes them.

22:26.131 --> 22:32.510
And then they ask him, "Now, say before Bhairavnath, confess it."

22:37.833 --> 22:42.899
And they confess what wrong they have done.

22:43.059 --> 22:52.751
So, He protect us, also from doing wrong things,

22:52.858 --> 22:56.412
sly things like thieving.

23:03.885 --> 23:06.947
Whatever we think we can do secretly, can be hidden,

23:07.107 --> 23:11.340
but you cannot hide it from Bhairavnath.

23:17.672 --> 23:22.750
If you don't change, then He exposes you completely.

23:25.414 --> 23:31.298
That's how He has exposed  all the horrible false gurus.

23:35.107 --> 23:39.219
So, today we are here to worship

23:39.379 --> 23:41.821
this great Deity of Bhiaravnatha

23:41.981 --> 23:46.554
who incarnated on this earth later on,

23:54.513 --> 23:58.021
ultimately as Mahavira also.

23:59.155 --> 24:03.913
So, He stands on the gate of hell

24:06.858 --> 24:10.959
and stops people from falling into hell.

24:15.482 --> 24:17.881
But if you want to go to hell,

24:18.041 --> 24:21.169
if it is your desire, is your willpower like that working,

24:21.329 --> 24:22.876
that I should go to hell, then He says,

24:23.036 --> 24:26.925
'All right, you can go.'

24:33.166 --> 24:39.636
But as you know, now the hell is also full of people.

24:43.455 --> 24:49.537
So, it’s better that we should try to fight our negativity

24:49.697 --> 24:56.601
and become fun-loving, enjoying others, loving others,

25:09.050 --> 25:12.922
not worrying about what others are doing to you,

25:13.082 --> 25:18.346
but only thinking what good you can do to others.

25:27.376 --> 25:34.828
So today's special Puja for Bhairavnath we offer,

25:37.861 --> 25:44.991
to give us a sense to laugh, to enjoy, to have fun.

25:53.549 --> 25:57.119
May God bless you all.
