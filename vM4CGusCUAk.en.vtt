00:00:08.908 --> 00:00:13.560
It is “sahaja”, it means born with you.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.980
It also means: it is spontaneous.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.314
So the right to become one with&nbsp;
the Divine is born with us.

00:00:22.314 --> 00:00:28.196
It is built in within our being,&nbsp;
the way it is shown here in a subtle&nbsp;way.

00:00:28.196 --> 00:00:30.900
All these centres are created within&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.080
us in the different stages of our evolution,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:42.780
which are being strengthened by the different&nbsp;
Incarnations of the Prophets and of the other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.200
Incarnations that they have made this&nbsp;
part available to us for our ascent.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.109
Now, the problem is that in this world,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.738
they are many people who are not yet&nbsp;
feeling this urge to be the Spirit.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.848
But there are still millions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:15.000
who are feeling that there is something beyond,&nbsp;
they are the special category of the people.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.620
So as William Blake has said that:&nbsp;
“Men of God have to become prophets,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.960
and they will have the power to make&nbsp;
other prophets”, that is The Time today.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.420
All of them have prophesized&nbsp;
about these special times,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:40.560
even Mahomet sahib has said it very clearly: “at&nbsp;
the time of Resurrection, your hands will speak”.&nbsp;

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.106
But people don’t talk of resurrection,&nbsp;
they just talk of the Doomsday.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:53.400
He was the same principal as other&nbsp;
Prophets were like Abraham, Moses,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.697 --> 00:02:00.759
Nanaka, Janaka, all of them are the&nbsp;
same principal of Primordial Master.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.080
They tried to teach you the balance&nbsp;
of life which is called as dharma.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:15.660
If you do not have the dharma within you - dharma&nbsp;
is the valency of man, is ten valences he has got,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:22.680
while the matter has got only eight, animals&nbsp;
nine, and the human beings have ten valences.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.600
So there has been principal&nbsp;
ten Incarnations and those&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.221
who came on this earth to teach us the balance.
