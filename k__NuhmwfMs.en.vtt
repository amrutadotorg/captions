WEBVTT

00:04.540 --> 00:14.700
I am immensely joyous to see you all here.

00:14.700 --> 00:26.360
I do not know what to say from my side.

00:26.360 --> 00:31.660
The words get lost, they have no meaning.

00:31.660 --> 00:47.670
So many of you are aspiring to ascend to that
state where you would have complete joy, bliss

00:47.670 --> 00:52.079
and peace.

00:52.079 --> 00:56.560
This is what I could give you.

00:56.560 --> 01:04.000
And a mother is only happy when she can give
whatever she has to her children.

01:04.000 --> 01:19.140
Her unhappiness, all her restlessness, everything
is just to achieve that end – to gift all

01:19.140 --> 01:23.810
that she has.

01:23.810 --> 01:35.010
I don’t know how much to thank you people
to go through all this to get to that treasure

01:35.010 --> 01:41.290
that you have within yourself.

01:41.290 --> 01:57.100
‘Sahaj’ is the only word I could think
[of] when I started to manifest Sahastrara

01:57.100 --> 01:59.590
opening.

01:59.590 --> 02:07.009
That’s easily understood by everyone so
far.

02:07.009 --> 02:16.610
But you have realised that it is today a different
style of yoga where first enlightenment is

02:16.610 --> 02:21.209
given and then you are allowed to look after
yourself.

02:21.209 --> 02:24.129
It was never done before.

02:24.129 --> 03:02.230
It’s just a venture of your Mother which
has worked out.

03:02.230 --> 03:23.079
Otherwise, in the olden times the concern
of Divine was to get people enlightened and

03:23.079 --> 03:28.269
It did not know how to work it out.

03:28.269 --> 03:36.200
No incarnation ever tried to work it out in
this fashion.

03:36.200 --> 03:50.319
But whenever they tried, they tried to have
a very severe hardship for the seekers – very

03:50.319 --> 03:51.909
severe hardships.

03:51.909 --> 04:00.730
I wonder how many of you have read the treatise
of Buddha, when he used to travel with thousand

04:00.730 --> 04:03.919
of his disciples – not giving Realisation.

04:03.919 --> 04:15.099
They were not Realised-souls, without feeling
any joy around; with two clothes, living in

04:15.099 --> 04:16.530
the jungles.

04:16.530 --> 04:20.700
Just two clothes!

04:20.700 --> 04:26.920
And the area where he visited, which I have
seen myself, is terribly cold, chilly, absolutely

04:26.920 --> 04:27.920
chilly.

04:27.920 --> 04:35.490
And the clothes were not clothes actually,
it was cloth covering their body.

04:35.490 --> 04:47.740
Sleeping on the open ground in very severe
winter or maybe in summer.

04:47.740 --> 04:52.120
Without any shoes they were asked to walk,
for miles together, miles together!

04:52.120 --> 04:57.810
If you go and see where Buddha has walked
and trodden, you will be surprised!

04:57.810 --> 05:02.720
Buddha was also young – he used to walk.

05:02.720 --> 05:08.360
But his disciples used to walk much more because
he would go and station at one place.

05:08.360 --> 05:09.930
He would send his disciples.

05:09.930 --> 05:15.780
There was no time to advertise or to announce
anything.

05:15.780 --> 05:22.690
So he used to stay in one place, and the disciples
used to go around the villages, ask for bhiksha

05:22.690 --> 05:32.370
– meaning the ‘alms’ – to gather some
food from the villages; cook one time, give

05:32.370 --> 05:34.310
part of it to Buddha.

05:34.310 --> 05:42.540
And rest of that they used to eat.

05:42.540 --> 05:47.570
They would go, work out, get people from all
the villages, whatever was possible and would

05:47.570 --> 05:51.420
bring them to Buddha for sermon.

05:51.420 --> 05:53.190
Such sacrifices!

05:53.190 --> 06:02.060
They have lived in huts, caves, in terrible
darkness, meditating.

06:02.060 --> 06:06.490
But they never got Realisation.

06:06.490 --> 06:10.930
Very few got their Realisation.

06:10.930 --> 06:23.360
They were people who were sons of great kings,
and princes, dukes, duchesses – all very,

06:23.360 --> 06:27.330
very rich people.

06:27.330 --> 06:35.500
Woman of very rich families followed him.

06:35.500 --> 06:46.640
And they walked for miles together with him
in the thorny routes; because they felt that

06:46.640 --> 06:57.360
Buddha’s work was of such universal importance,
that they are the part and parcel of such

06:57.360 --> 07:08.400
a tremendous task; that they should be taking
part in such a great work for humanity.

07:08.400 --> 07:19.130
This is not only in India, but even Viditama
who started the Zen system in Japan.

07:19.130 --> 07:24.900
In China, I was surprised, the amount of sacrifices
the saints had made, the way they lived!

07:24.900 --> 07:29.560
I mean if you see the way they were living
– in the conditions – you cannot imagine!

07:29.560 --> 07:38.240
And they ended up their lives like that, working
it out.

07:38.240 --> 07:42.580
Without any proper guidance because Buddha
had died – there was no way out.

07:42.580 --> 07:44.720
They had to find their own ways.

07:44.720 --> 07:51.710
Then they found mahayan and shvetayan – all
kind of things.

07:51.710 --> 07:57.230
Even if you see other seekers in other religions
– like at the time of Christ – where did

07:57.230 --> 07:59.220
they live?

07:59.220 --> 08:05.650
And after the death of Christ it was even
worse because they were persecuted, they were

08:05.650 --> 08:10.280
killed, they were tortured, crucified!

08:10.280 --> 08:20.170
It happened with Moses also – his disciples
were hounded so they had to all run towards

08:20.170 --> 08:21.170
India.

08:21.170 --> 08:23.690
Imagine the distances!

08:23.690 --> 08:32.289
From that area to Kashmir – how they must
have walked, how they must have lived, how

08:32.289 --> 08:34.959
they must have carried.

08:34.959 --> 08:40.159
And in thousands, in thousands they came,
to India.

08:40.159 --> 08:47.690
Because they realised that they are doing
a tremendous task.

08:47.690 --> 08:52.160
Something so great that they are supporting.

08:52.160 --> 08:56.899
In this country we had a struggle of freedom.

08:56.899 --> 08:58.579
I was part and parcel of that.

08:58.579 --> 09:01.139
My parents were part and parcel of that.

09:01.139 --> 09:05.699
They were rich people, quite rich I should
say, from every standard.

09:05.699 --> 09:10.339
You will be amazed – my father burnt all
his suits.

09:10.339 --> 09:13.470
They were stitched in England.

09:13.470 --> 09:16.620
My mother burnt all her saris.

09:16.620 --> 09:24.089
They used to spin their own clothes and wear
them.

09:24.089 --> 09:31.839
My father sacrificed everything, every pie
that he had, for the freedom struggle (1 pie

09:31.839 --> 09:32.839
= rupee 1/192).

09:32.839 --> 09:36.690
He left nothing for us, not a single [pie].

09:36.690 --> 09:42.069
Of course, our family being rich we had silver
and gold and all that but as far as all the

09:42.069 --> 09:46.620
cash money was concerned – was spent.

09:46.620 --> 09:51.459
And all this silver and gold also, thanks
to English, that they took away from us and

09:51.459 --> 09:54.010
they returned us when they went back.

09:54.010 --> 09:58.709
That’s how we had some silver and gold left
in the family.

09:58.709 --> 10:01.879
Every thing, all that is material, was snatched
away.

10:01.879 --> 10:02.879
And I know.

10:02.879 --> 10:07.750
We lived in beautiful houses and then we shifted
to huts and lived there.

10:07.750 --> 10:08.750
Sacrifices to the maximum.

10:08.750 --> 10:13.119
And we were very happy about it, very proud!

10:13.119 --> 10:15.560
We had only two changes (of clothes).

10:15.560 --> 10:17.720
We used to wash our clothes.

10:17.720 --> 10:25.119
We lived like very poor people; sleeping on
this kind of thing (thin, rough floor mats).

10:25.119 --> 10:37.611
For my life, I remember that I never used
to take a pillow; I never used chappals (sandals)

10:37.611 --> 10:38.611
for ages.

10:38.611 --> 10:43.180
I had only one sweater made of this kind of
a material.

10:43.180 --> 10:49.699
Till I passed out and went to medical college,
I had that sweater with me.

10:49.699 --> 10:55.719
I had only one coat, throughout my education
when I was in Lahore which was terribly cold

10:55.719 --> 11:02.949
– sometimes can be like London – which
was worn out and finished.

11:02.949 --> 11:08.160
But we never grudged and never grumbled and
never said that our father should have looked

11:08.160 --> 11:13.579
after us and done something, “Why did he
just sacrifice everything for the country?”

11:13.579 --> 11:14.579
Never!

11:14.579 --> 11:15.579
Never!

11:15.579 --> 11:16.579
Never!

11:16.579 --> 11:25.500
But even today, when they see us anywhere,
they know we are the children of such a great

11:25.500 --> 11:26.500
man.

11:26.500 --> 11:29.519
They have tremendous respect for us.

11:29.519 --> 11:34.930
That quality was created, I should say by
Mahatma Gandhi.

11:34.930 --> 11:44.050
He made everybody so transformed into a new
personality of tremendous sacrifice!

11:44.050 --> 11:45.060
Tremendous!

11:45.060 --> 11:49.139
You cannot imagine how people lived!

11:49.139 --> 11:57.769
All the money we had, everything that we had,
all conveniences and conveyances, all housing,

11:57.769 --> 12:03.660
everything, was given up – not only by my
father but so many of them.

12:03.660 --> 12:10.749
Otherwise we could have not got our freedom.

12:10.749 --> 12:16.679
To get our freedom this country has sacrificed
so much.

12:16.679 --> 12:30.110
Now, after that, we are here to get our freedom,
to get the freedom for our Spirit.

12:30.110 --> 12:39.509
To make our Spirit free from our greed, lust;
from your anger, from our conditionings, from

12:39.509 --> 12:53.980
our terrible ego, from the body being enslaved
by comforts.

12:53.980 --> 12:57.700
I must say Gandhiji had a special charm.

12:57.700 --> 13:00.819
I don’t know how he managed.

13:00.819 --> 13:07.440
He was like Touch of Midas – he touched
anybody and he became transformed.

13:07.440 --> 13:17.649
And he was an extremely strict man – very
kind to me, to children – but he was an

13:17.649 --> 13:19.220
extremely strict man.

13:19.220 --> 13:22.220
He would not tolerate any nonsense at all!

13:22.220 --> 13:32.939
Throughout, if you study in the way all these
people were brought up, not only for freedom

13:32.939 --> 13:41.629
of independence, but even before that, for
Spiritual life, anywhere, there’s one thing

13:41.629 --> 13:45.970
very common – is sacrifice.

13:45.970 --> 13:53.079
And the consciousness that you are doing something
great, consciousness that you are part and

13:53.079 --> 14:02.839
parcel of the whole, such a big thing, such
a big work, such a noble cause!!

14:02.839 --> 14:21.689
And then there was one thing very common among
all of them: that the noble cause, the upliftment

14:21.689 --> 14:30.180
(sic) of the noble cause, made them sacrifice
in such a sahaj manner.

14:30.180 --> 14:34.279
Much more than the Sahaj Yogis sometimes,
who have got so much in Sahaj Yoga.

14:34.279 --> 14:37.009
They have got their joy, they have got their
Spirit.

14:37.009 --> 14:43.470
But I have seen with my own eyes, such people
in this country; whom you may call legendary

14:43.470 --> 14:46.319
but I have seen it.

14:46.319 --> 14:50.699
Thousands of people were killed and butchered,
children died.

14:50.699 --> 14:52.329
Nobody shed tears.

14:52.329 --> 14:56.120
Nobody shed tears.

14:56.120 --> 15:13.709
But to feel that you are for such a noble
cause itself gives you that joy and that sense

15:13.709 --> 15:16.470
of involvement!

15:16.470 --> 15:24.819
And moreover, what I know about Mahatma Gandhi
and other people, what I have seen, how they

15:24.819 --> 15:30.139
were – everybody was not allowed to come
in.

15:30.139 --> 15:38.139
And anybody who did slightest thing less,
whether he was king’s son or he was anybody’s

15:38.139 --> 15:47.420
daughter or anything, any little thing they
spoilt, anything – he was chucked out.

15:47.420 --> 15:53.499
I have stayed in Gandhi’s ashram, so I know
what it is, and that’s why you know I can

15:53.499 --> 15:55.149
go through rigorous life.

15:55.149 --> 15:56.799
It is his training.

15:56.799 --> 16:03.459
All the children above twelve years had to
clean the whole of that ashram area – which

16:03.459 --> 16:06.910
is in fifty acres of land – every morning.

16:06.910 --> 16:12.489
They had to clean their latrines.

16:12.489 --> 16:16.170
Also the latrines of the guests.

16:16.170 --> 16:21.259
I have cleaned!

16:21.259 --> 16:25.990
And they were allowed only two dresses.

16:25.990 --> 16:30.800
And nothing could be kept, even you cannot
see one paper anywhere, any litter anywhere

16:30.800 --> 16:36.589
– so clean, spick and span.

16:36.589 --> 16:41.799
And the living places were so neat and tidy.

16:41.799 --> 16:47.449
It was all done with cow dung, completely
with cow dung.

16:47.449 --> 16:55.160
Everybody had to take a bath, early in the
morning at 4 o’ clock, with cold water.

16:55.160 --> 17:03.920
Whether it was Jawaharlal Nehru or Abdul Kalam
Azad, my father, of any age group, or a child.

17:03.920 --> 17:09.420
And 5 o’clock, mahatma Gandhi was there
for his lecture.

17:09.420 --> 17:12.990
Please don’t raise your hands or raise your
Kundalinis!

17:12.990 --> 17:14.070
Please be seated!

17:14.070 --> 17:15.500
That’s not the way!

17:15.500 --> 17:19.870
Try to understand what I am talking!

17:19.870 --> 17:31.800
And then, early in the morning at 4 o’clock,
you will be surprised, getting up.

17:31.800 --> 17:36.120
For me it was alright!

17:36.120 --> 17:45.260
And then to walk in that fifty acres of land
to centre of that hall, which was nothing

17:45.260 --> 17:50.890
but just an open space surrounded by some
sort of huts where Gandhiji was living.

17:50.890 --> 17:55.040
To walk all the way after bath, after getting
ready and all that.

17:55.040 --> 17:58.550
And snakes used to crawl along.

17:58.550 --> 18:00.010
Nobody was bitten, of course.

18:00.010 --> 18:09.290
I think the snakes understood that people
were busy with the great job of freeing this

18:09.290 --> 18:11.520
great country!

18:11.520 --> 18:19.070
And we would sit just like this and the snakes
would be crawling.

18:19.070 --> 18:20.620
No lights were allowed.

18:20.620 --> 18:23.800
No lights of any kind.

18:23.800 --> 18:30.100
We only used sunlight.

18:30.100 --> 18:35.060
And when Gandhiji would come – I mean sunlight
was not there in the morning, at all – some

18:35.060 --> 18:39.730
lanterns were brought to put there.

18:39.730 --> 18:43.030
And we would see the snakes crawling up.

18:43.030 --> 18:46.830
But I never heard anybody complaining.

18:46.830 --> 18:57.760
But like a war, drove with such passion, everybody,
competing as to, “What I can do?

18:57.760 --> 19:01.460
How I can be alright?”

19:01.460 --> 19:07.080
Nobody even thought of comfort!

19:07.080 --> 19:20.500
Of course they were all up to 50 years of
age or something like that, maybe.

19:20.500 --> 19:27.110
In the ashram mostly people were up to fifty
years of age – at that time.

19:27.110 --> 19:38.430
And I have seen by my own eyes the people
who had huge cars in the house and things

19:38.430 --> 19:43.430
like that, they sold [them] off, they threw
it away.

19:43.430 --> 19:46.660
They used to come by train to Wardha station
and walk down.

19:46.660 --> 19:50.380
Gandhiji would not see anybody coming even
in tonga (horse-cart).

19:50.380 --> 19:57.610
And they listened to him and obeyed him.

19:57.610 --> 20:03.510
I have seen many missionaries, though they
are not up to point, nothing very noble, but

20:03.510 --> 20:07.700
that’s how they take people to task and
people work it out for them.

20:07.700 --> 20:08.700
I have seen them.

20:08.700 --> 20:18.520
In India we had missionaries, and younger
people who came from abroad, they just absolutely

20:18.520 --> 20:27.150
obediently listened to the missionaries and
did whatever they said.

20:27.150 --> 20:35.080
Now today we are doing, as you know, the greatest
of greatest work!

20:35.080 --> 20:41.140
Because freedom is of course necessary, political
freedom, to talk about the God.

20:41.140 --> 20:44.890
We could not even make a small, little needle!

20:44.890 --> 20:47.150
At that time we were not allowed by government.

20:47.150 --> 20:48.150
So much oppressed.

20:48.150 --> 20:53.110
So we had to get out of the shackles of slavery.

20:53.110 --> 20:56.160
No doubt.

20:56.160 --> 21:08.970
But now I find we have another kind of slavery
– a slavery of selfishness, self oriented.

21:08.970 --> 21:11.240
“This is my comfort.

21:11.240 --> 21:17.180
I must have this, it should be enjoyable,
I am enjoying, I am this, I am that."

21:17.180 --> 21:19.280
You should enjoy otherwise it is not something
great.

21:19.280 --> 21:28.850
I mean the whole thing should provide you
some sort of a feeling instead of you providing

21:28.850 --> 21:30.240
the feeling.

21:30.240 --> 21:39.070
Because people, I think, do not know what
they are doing, what sort of a work they are

21:39.070 --> 21:40.070
doing.

21:40.070 --> 21:45.262
They do not want to come to that level of
that height to see what are you up to.

21:45.262 --> 21:51.370
You are trying to save the whole world!

21:51.370 --> 21:57.570
This is one of the reasons Sahaj Yoga moves
so slowly, because I see people who are worried

21:57.570 --> 22:02.870
about their comforts, this, that, and also
themselves are so lousy!

22:02.870 --> 22:12.190
There’s no smartness about them, no feeling
of that greatness that they have to do.

22:12.190 --> 22:13.190
You have to be smart.

22:13.190 --> 22:22.630
If you know you are on war – how you behave?

22:22.630 --> 22:27.640
I am sure the mediocrity is much less now,
better people.

22:27.640 --> 22:32.010
I am sure we will get even better people now,
much better people!

22:32.010 --> 22:37.340
They worry about little, little things: of
their family, this, that.

22:37.340 --> 22:43.140
They worry about their own problems, and their
jobs, and this and that.

22:43.140 --> 22:45.450
I mean nobody could talk like this to Gandhiji!

22:45.450 --> 22:49.420
I tell you, he would have slapped you!

22:49.420 --> 22:52.870
Take it from me.

22:52.870 --> 22:59.070
It is as if to come to Sahaj Yoga means – solve
your problems – that’s all.

22:59.070 --> 23:04.410
Though they are solved, no doubt, you are
helped, God helps you so much.

23:04.410 --> 23:07.230
But how much are you doing about it?

23:07.230 --> 23:18.710
Of course we have some very great Sahaj yogis,
I would not deny that fact, we have some – much

23:18.710 --> 23:23.190
more than I had, ever – and that’s why
I am very joyous about it.

23:23.190 --> 23:30.660
But the dedication we have: we count every
penny that we spend, how much we have got

23:30.660 --> 23:33.990
out of that penny, what did we do about it.

23:33.990 --> 23:40.000
This is not
the way!

23:40.000 --> 23:41.961
Buddha never spent a single penny of his own.

23:41.961 --> 23:43.890
He got money from all his disciples.

23:43.890 --> 23:46.120
Built all these big things and all that.

23:46.120 --> 23:53.440
He never had even a public help from anybody
else.

23:53.440 --> 23:54.680
So rise now!

23:54.680 --> 23:58.280
You must rise above your petty small mind.

23:58.280 --> 24:05.740
Rise up to the point where you should know
[that] you are going to save the whole humanity.

24:05.740 --> 24:12.450
If you cannot feel that, it’s better to
leave Sahaj Yoga.

24:12.450 --> 24:17.420
Sahaj Yoga is not meant for the people who
are lousy.

24:17.420 --> 24:19.490
In Marathi the word is ‘gabale’.

24:19.490 --> 24:29.500
Tukaram has said, “yerya gabalyache kaama
nohe” (meaning) “It is not the work of

24:29.500 --> 24:31.440
the lousy!”

24:31.440 --> 24:41.780
Shivaji himself, when he fought his war, he
caught hold of people, the sartaras and the

24:41.780 --> 24:43.980
dukes of that time they were.

24:43.980 --> 24:49.320
They gave up everything they had, they gave
up their lives, every thing!

24:49.320 --> 24:53.631
Their children they sacrificed, they sacrificed
whatever they had!

24:53.631 --> 24:59.320
Shivaji had no money to pay them.

24:59.320 --> 25:04.490
You must have heard lots of stories about
Shivaji.

25:04.490 --> 25:11.180
While if you see how we Sahaj yogis are in
this world: kshema (well-being) comes before

25:11.180 --> 25:12.180
yoga.

25:12.180 --> 25:14.050
Its like that.

25:14.050 --> 25:16.880
Its your mother’s love.

25:16.880 --> 25:19.660
I want my children to be comfortable.

25:19.660 --> 25:20.660
They are newly born babes.

25:20.660 --> 25:29.020
Alright, they need comfort, they are to be
looked after.

25:29.020 --> 25:39.120
But I cannot blackmail the Divine because
the children are small can I!

25:39.120 --> 25:45.370
I am here to do the job of God Almighty.

25:45.370 --> 25:54.900
And when you are my children his grace will
work, He’ll look after you, He’ll make

25:54.900 --> 25:56.110
you grow.

25:56.110 --> 25:57.920
But grow now!

25:57.920 --> 25:58.920
Grow!

25:58.920 --> 25:59.920
You have to grow!

25:59.920 --> 26:03.860
Get out of this small nonsense that you are!

26:03.860 --> 26:07.040
See your personality – how do you live?

26:07.040 --> 26:09.700
Where is your attention?

26:09.700 --> 26:11.090
What do you think?

26:11.090 --> 26:16.520
Are you thinking about Sahaj Yoga, that it
is the most important thing for which you

26:16.520 --> 26:20.360
are chosen?

26:20.360 --> 26:33.740
I feel sometimes, as I was feeling all the
time, that you might be uncomfortable in many

26:33.740 --> 26:34.740
places.

26:34.740 --> 26:39.900
But I myself have seen the way you people
have been in those places, most carelessly

26:39.900 --> 26:43.440
– the Western Sahaj yogis, I was surprised.

26:43.440 --> 26:47.690
That way Indians are better in this respect.

26:47.690 --> 26:52.450
And some of the Indian Sahaj yogis have been
misbehaving in a very funny manner.

26:52.450 --> 26:53.450
It shocked me!

26:53.450 --> 26:59.140
The way they have been behaving, shouting
at people, creating problems.

26:59.140 --> 27:04.520
Some people come to see me, they talk to them
in such a rude manner that they run away.

27:04.520 --> 27:07.140
You can talk to them sweetly.

27:07.140 --> 27:09.990
You have to be nice to them; not to shout
at people.

27:09.990 --> 27:14.930
Alright, I cannot meet everyone at every time,
at every convenience, but that does not mean

27:14.930 --> 27:19.990
that you have right to shout at others.

27:19.990 --> 27:29.510
This is so petty and so low that I don’t
know how far I have to come down!

27:29.510 --> 27:39.500
When you rise above all these petty things,
you will develop that Divine discretion.

27:39.500 --> 27:43.240
That Divine discretion is the real blessing
of God.

27:43.240 --> 27:49.090
All other blessings, that you think is a blessing,
is no blessing at all!

27:49.090 --> 27:53.440
Unless and until you can grow, what is the
blessing?

27:53.440 --> 27:57.920
Like a tree which says, “Oh, such a blessing
that I have got rain!”

27:57.920 --> 28:04.300
But out of that rain if you cannot grow, what’s
the use of having that rain on you?

28:04.300 --> 28:19.310
You have to be compassionate, beautiful, sensible
people, who are the highest beings on this

28:19.310 --> 28:20.310
earth.

28:20.310 --> 28:27.130
Take out your attention from all nonsense
that you have been busy with.

28:27.130 --> 28:34.280
That’s how you get possessed, that’s how
you get conditioned.

28:34.280 --> 28:38.510
Small, small things you see.

28:38.510 --> 28:43.690
In India we have another problem: We cannot
tolerate another person.

28:43.690 --> 28:47.940
If any person is doing good for Sahaj Yoga,
immediately a group is built up (against them)

28:47.940 --> 28:49.450
– it’s very common with Indians also.

28:49.450 --> 28:55.670
A group is built up to put him down.

28:55.670 --> 29:01.080
This was not done when Gandhiji was there.

29:01.080 --> 29:04.270
I do not know how it happens.

29:04.270 --> 29:07.470
It only happens with poor leadership.

29:07.470 --> 29:10.530
I think I don’t have that leadership!

29:10.530 --> 29:15.430
At the time of Gandhiji he used to blast people
out completely!

29:15.430 --> 29:23.620
Cutting each other’s throats and saying
things behind the back, forming groups.

29:23.620 --> 29:28.830
Anybody who works out something nice, and
I try to help that person to express himself,

29:28.830 --> 29:35.760
immediately a group comes up to press him.

29:35.760 --> 29:39.910
And there are some hopelessly peripheral,
useless Sahaj Yogis in the West and in the

29:39.910 --> 29:45.090
East, who try to make a mess of things.

29:45.090 --> 29:48.900
They think, they are big gurus, big people!

29:48.900 --> 29:50.500
Very small people.

29:50.500 --> 29:53.080
Chicken hearted, I should say.

29:53.080 --> 29:58.920
And they think they are very big, great people,
because they can take good photographs, maybe,

29:58.920 --> 30:03.180
or that they can wear a dress in a particular
manner, or something like that – stupid

30:03.180 --> 30:05.620
stuff as they are!

30:05.620 --> 30:10.090
And trying to dominate others.

30:10.090 --> 30:13.920
Such people will be thrown out, absolutely.

30:13.920 --> 30:20.050
No use having useless people in a machine
like this.

30:20.050 --> 30:29.730
Today is the beginning of a new era – of
a new era of people of very high qualities

30:29.730 --> 30:34.670
whose Spirit has been enlightened.

30:34.670 --> 30:40.600
Let us all think about it!

30:40.600 --> 30:48.930
Now you have to rule yourself, and you have
to rule others through compassion, love and

30:48.930 --> 30:49.930
discretion!!

30:49.930 --> 30:56.490
Today that’s the big time that I have declared
that it is the Universal Religion, the Nirmala

30:56.490 --> 31:03.950
Religion which is formed out of my teachings
of love.

31:03.950 --> 31:08.190
But it doesn’t mean by any chance that you
remain dwarfs!

31:08.190 --> 31:14.390
I’m not going to spoil you!

31:14.390 --> 31:20.740
I am not going to spoil you by keeping you
dwarfy people!

31:20.740 --> 31:25.580
So try to rise!

31:25.580 --> 31:27.420
Do not dominate others.

31:27.420 --> 31:28.510
Respect!

31:28.510 --> 31:31.330
Respect each other!

31:31.330 --> 31:37.850
You are out for a very big work of Viraat.

31:37.850 --> 31:45.680
How much you know about the Divine nobody
has known so far!

31:45.680 --> 31:47.480
But fix up yourself.

31:47.480 --> 31:56.200
I have known a very great saint called Gagangadh
Maharaj who has fallen down completely!

31:56.200 --> 32:01.270
If a person like him can fall down you also
can fall down if you do not understand what

32:01.270 --> 32:09.300
is your worth, what is your value and what
is your position you are given.

32:09.300 --> 32:17.081
So we have to, today, with all our love for
our Mother, have to decide in our heart, that

32:17.081 --> 32:19.240
we are going to have large heartedness, of
sacrifices!

32:19.240 --> 32:22.770
What have we sacrificed so far?

32:22.770 --> 32:24.250
Just think of it.

32:24.250 --> 32:25.250
Have we?

32:25.250 --> 32:36.700
Did we sacrifice anything?

32:36.700 --> 32:48.940
Please try to understand that I have to use
you, the great souls, to save the humanity.

32:48.940 --> 32:49.940
You must grow.

32:49.940 --> 32:50.940
You must grow.

32:50.940 --> 32:51.940
You have to grow.

32:51.940 --> 32:56.970
On money points also people are wretched.

32:56.970 --> 32:59.610
They make money.

32:59.610 --> 33:02.710
They save money.

33:02.710 --> 33:11.500
In America, I was surprised, the way people
cheated me of money!

33:11.500 --> 33:12.740
Thousands!

33:12.740 --> 33:20.230
In India also this is a very common practice!

33:20.230 --> 33:30.160
Then if you have career mindedness, and you
are very ambitious, “How my job will remain?”

33:30.160 --> 33:37.080
this, that – you better get out of Sahaj
Yoga!

33:37.080 --> 33:44.440
It’s not going to help us at all!

33:44.440 --> 33:50.770
Thirdly there are people who believe that,
“This is my wife, this is my beloved, this

33:50.770 --> 33:52.340
is this,” and all that nonsense.

33:52.340 --> 33:53.920
Why are you here?

33:53.920 --> 33:55.410
For what?

33:55.410 --> 34:05.060
Or “My children, my household, my mother,
my father."

34:05.060 --> 34:08.780
all sorts of wretched people around!

34:08.780 --> 34:16.200
If you cannot rise above that, you cannot
help me, I am sorry.

34:16.200 --> 34:18.700
You cannot help me.

34:18.700 --> 34:24.210
You have to be very, very strong people.

34:24.210 --> 34:34.310
You have to be people of very great valour
and great idealism and noble ideas.

34:34.310 --> 34:47.110
Some are like petty shopkeepers who follow
the platoons to sell some things around – in

34:47.110 --> 34:53.530
Marathi it is called ‘bazar bhunge’!

34:53.530 --> 35:08.430
So now you meditate on this point that here
we are to establish the Universal Religion

35:08.430 --> 35:09.430
of ascent.

35:09.430 --> 35:12.670
It is a tremendous task!

35:12.670 --> 35:22.714
If I could do it alone I would have done it
but I cannot.

35:22.714 --> 35:26.530
It’s only through you I have to do it.

35:26.530 --> 35:27.530
And you have a heritage.

35:27.530 --> 35:42.460
You come from a very great birth, where you
have this heritage.

35:42.460 --> 35:51.950
With that heritage, if I cannot manage you,
I think I better give up your leadership.

35:51.950 --> 35:55.210
I cannot do it!

35:55.210 --> 36:05.610
When we were fighting for our freedom all
of us were removed from schools because we

36:05.610 --> 36:11.530
were in the missionary school and the missionaries
believed that Christ was born in England!

36:11.530 --> 36:13.460
So they would not allow us to study in those
schools.

36:13.460 --> 36:15.300
So we were all removed from those schools.

36:15.300 --> 36:17.410
We had no education for some time.

36:17.410 --> 36:20.900
I couldn’t pass my inter-science for two
years.

36:20.900 --> 36:27.280
I couldn’t appear because they rusticated
us from colleges and schools.

36:27.280 --> 36:34.180
The government rusticated us.

36:34.180 --> 36:38.640
But we were such proud children, very proud.

36:38.640 --> 36:41.830
I was of course very much thick in it.

36:41.830 --> 36:42.830
I was never frightened.

36:42.830 --> 36:44.470
I was just an eighteen year old girl.

36:44.470 --> 36:53.690
And I remember one day some people came and
told us that your father is transferred from

36:53.690 --> 36:56.390
this jail to another jail.

36:56.390 --> 36:59.490
They had such pride for all of us, all the
people!

36:59.490 --> 37:01.470
So they had brought cars to take us down.

37:01.470 --> 37:07.619
And they were so many there.

37:07.619 --> 37:11.290
And [my] mother naturally was worried because
I was a young girl.

37:11.290 --> 37:17.000
The police used to torture me, used to give
me [electric] shocks, and make my life very

37:17.000 --> 37:19.110
miserable, beat me, and all that.

37:19.110 --> 37:25.880
So she was crying and she told an old gentleman
who was there that, “I am worried about

37:25.880 --> 37:26.880
my daughter.

37:26.880 --> 37:31.869
I do not want her to be tortured anymore."

37:31.869 --> 37:38.560
So I went and smiled at him, so he said, “No,
you stop it now!

37:38.560 --> 37:40.610
You just don’t do it.

37:40.610 --> 37:42.320
It’s not proper."

37:42.320 --> 37:48.130
So my father took me aside, he said, “Don’t
listen to this ‘old johnny’!

37:48.130 --> 37:51.100
He’s now about to die.

37:51.100 --> 37:53.640
Forget him.

37:53.640 --> 38:01.380
I would like all my children to be sacrificed
on the altar of freedom.

38:01.380 --> 38:04.340
If you are doing it I am a proud father.

38:04.340 --> 38:07.660
And I will tell your mother to behave herself.

38:07.660 --> 38:16.780
I am so proud of you!”

38:16.780 --> 38:20.122
Such atmosphere I have passed through.

38:20.122 --> 38:23.869
I had to give up my college.

38:23.869 --> 38:26.530
I was absconding for eight months.

38:26.530 --> 38:29.890
The police was after my life.

38:29.890 --> 38:31.220
I know what we have gone through.

38:31.220 --> 38:34.190
We were very young people -eighteen years.

38:34.190 --> 38:36.630
You can imagine!

38:36.630 --> 38:48.670
And now when you have got the freedom of your
Spirit you must seek the comfort of your Spirit.

38:48.670 --> 38:52.890
There are some people who are complainers,
and this and that -nonsense.

38:52.890 --> 38:54.420
They should not have come!

38:54.420 --> 39:00.450
Or those who are Indians – they should get
out of Sahaj Yoga and leave us alone.

39:00.450 --> 39:08.340
But, those who know that they have come here,
not to enjoy themselves only, but to make

39:08.340 --> 39:13.180
the whole world enjoy what you have got, to
give it to them.

39:13.180 --> 39:22.750
And for that one has to sacrifice, one has
to bear the pangs!

39:22.750 --> 39:28.740
How much I bear your pangs when you are caught
up, when you have troubles, when this and

39:28.740 --> 39:29.740
that.

39:29.740 --> 39:31.130
I have got blisters sometimes, from you, everything.

39:31.130 --> 39:40.550
But I don’t mind because it is my life,
my mission, my existence, my everything- is

39:40.550 --> 39:44.470
for the purpose of emancipation of humanity.

39:44.470 --> 39:48.960
Even the last drop of my blood is for that.

39:48.960 --> 39:52.640
So my satisfactions are very different.

39:52.640 --> 40:01.710
Please remember, you are born of a very brave
Mother.

40:01.710 --> 40:04.030
Please, try to rise!

40:04.030 --> 40:10.730
Be proud that you are doing such a tremendous
task.

40:10.730 --> 40:19.060
Have that feeling of great valour.

40:19.060 --> 40:24.990
Then only, then only, we can achieve results!

40:24.990 --> 40:29.580
You have seen so many wars, you have seen
so many war pictures, you have seen how people

40:29.580 --> 40:33.170
have fought, how they have sacrificed themselves.

40:33.170 --> 40:44.800
And let us see what are we doing in this war!

40:44.800 --> 40:48.470
Just make your body your slave.

40:48.470 --> 41:00.510
Get out of the slavery of your body, of your
conditionings, and your nonsensical ego.

41:00.510 --> 41:06.580
I am sure as a Mother I am not so bad.

41:06.580 --> 41:14.270
But as a father I think I lack some things.

41:14.270 --> 41:27.220
Please try to come up so that I should feel
that I did not lack in my fatherly attitude

41:27.220 --> 41:36.540
towards you – that awe, that understanding
of a father’s expectations.

41:36.540 --> 41:46.880
This I am not saying to you because it is
some present situation, because a few people

41:46.880 --> 41:54.300
particularly, or for anything which is very,
very sort of [a] present day problem.

41:54.300 --> 41:56.490
None of these things.

41:56.490 --> 42:07.200
But is my announcement of this new dimension
into which we have to rise.

42:07.200 --> 42:12.609
And as in the war, we have to declare, “Now
forward on!”

42:12.609 --> 42:15.180
In the same way this is a declaration.

42:15.180 --> 42:21.330
In no way to degrade you, in no way to insult
you, or to say anything about anyone of you.

42:21.330 --> 42:31.320
But to just infuse that inspiration which
led thousands and thousands and millions and

42:31.320 --> 42:38.730
billions of people to sacrifice for a greater
cause!

42:38.730 --> 42:44.440
So now have respect for yourself.

42:44.440 --> 42:45.440
Raise your heads!

42:45.440 --> 42:49.950
You are the ones who are going to fight.

42:49.950 --> 42:53.660
You are the ones who are responsible.

42:53.660 --> 42:55.180
Prepare yourself!

42:55.180 --> 42:57.350
Prepare your body.

42:57.350 --> 43:01.460
Prepare your mind!

43:01.460 --> 43:04.210
Be discreet!

43:04.210 --> 43:12.330
This is my, I would not say ‘request’
again.

43:12.330 --> 43:14.470
This is my order!

43:14.470 --> 43:20.300
May God bless you!

43:20.300 --> 43:27.579
Let us all meditate now!

43:27.579 --> 43:30.870
There is no need for tying up your Kundalinis.

43:30.870 --> 43:32.510
There is no need to give yourself bandhan.

43:32.510 --> 43:37.010
There is no need at all to do anything.

43:37.010 --> 43:39.760
If you come up to that stage just now.

43:39.760 --> 43:43.000
There’s no need to raise your hands and
tying up your Kundalini – not necessary.

43:43.000 --> 43:47.150
Nothing is to be done!

43:47.150 --> 43:52.830
Your Kundalinis are already tied up.

43:52.830 --> 43:53.890
Assume!

43:53.890 --> 43:56.090
Assume that situation, that’s all!

43:56.090 --> 44:18.060
That’s what you are – the veeras and not
the stupid!

44:18.060 --> 44:19.060
Respect yourself.

44:19.060 --> 44:20.060
Respect!

44:20.060 --> 44:21.310
May God bless you all.

44:21.310 --> 44:30.510
There’s nothing, nothing more important
to me than to see you rise to that level of

44:30.510 --> 44:34.550
understanding of your own values and worth
and discretion.

44:34.550 --> 44:47.390
You have to become sweet, nice people but
very, very powerful!

44:47.390 --> 44:51.000
That you can control yourself, your tongues
and your things.

44:51.000 --> 44:57.619
The control, complete control of your self.

44:57.619 --> 45:05.860
May God bless you again!

45:05.860 --> 45:07.940
Please meditate.

45:07.940 --> 45:11.060
Close your eyes!

45:11.060 --> 45:14.170
Close your eyes!

45:14.170 --> 45:18.330
Just close your eyes.

45:18.330 --> 45:25.600
Put your both the hands towards me.

45:25.600 --> 45:29.590
Put your attention onto Sahastrara!

45:29.590 --> 45:31.160
Just your attention onto Sahastrara.

45:31.160 --> 45:34.280
You are in my Sahastrara all of you just now.

45:34.280 --> 45:36.600
Put your attention to your Sahastrara.

45:36.600 --> 45:39.550
There’s no thought, nothing.

45:39.550 --> 45:50.560
Just put your attention to your…and just
rise up to that point.

45:50.560 --> 45:56.500
There’s no drama about it.

45:56.500 --> 46:00.060
There’s nothing artificial.

46:00.060 --> 46:02.440
It’s actualisation.

46:02.440 --> 46:06.320
All weaknesses are to be left behind.

46:06.320 --> 46:38.600
Let’s be strong people of strong values
with dignity and sobriety.

50:38.600 --> 50:41.920
Silence, absolute inner silence.

50:41.920 --> 50:44.640
And one need not talk too much.

50:44.640 --> 50:54.600
Too much to jabber, to talk, frivolously,
is not your way.

50:54.609 --> 51:25.330
Feel it in your heart, your own dignity, your
own glory, the serenity of behaviour.

51:37.000 --> 51:46.400
You are all saints, but saints of very high
quality, of very high quality.

51:46.400 --> 51:47.400
Not ordinary type.

53:36.100 --> 53:37.600
Put your attention to Sahastrara.

53:37.600 --> 53:40.420
Chitta aple Sahastrara tevaitze.

53:40.420 --> 53:47.900
Apne Sahastrar pe apna Chitta tev. (Marathi: Put your attention to your Sahastrara)

54:48.000 --> 54:53.080
Any thought coming say, “Not this, not this,
not this."

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
May God bless you.

55:33.000 --> 55:40.480
I would like to see all the groups some time,
one by one, all the leaders and also certain

55:40.480 --> 55:45.660
individuals who want to see me.

55:45.660 --> 56:03.140
We are going to have marriages, and everything,
performed here and it’s going to work out

56:03.140 --> 56:04.000
very well.

56:04.500 --> 56:07.860
But suddenly don’t jump onto the thing!

56:08.500 --> 56:19.880
Do it in your sobriety, in understanding that,
this marriage is nothing but because you have

56:19.880 --> 56:30.220
to have children of very high quality. Secondly it has to be auspicious.

56:32.000 --> 56:36.740
Just to wash off if there was any inauspiciousness.

56:48.300 --> 57:02.420
I hope you will enjoy your heights now, you
will enjoy you glory and you will enjoy your noble work.

57:02.420 --> 57:04.300
May God bless you.
