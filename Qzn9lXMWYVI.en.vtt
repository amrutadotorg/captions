00:10:09.657 --> 00:10:17.938
Today we are here to celebrate Krishna
Puja.

00:10:19.617 --> 00:10:28.379
I went to America and they wanted me
to have a Mahakali Puja.

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:32.860
But I said, no, let me talk about Krishna
only,

00:10:33.061 --> 00:10:44.108
because we have to first realize what is
the strength of this Puja.

00:10:44.621 --> 00:10:50.793
How are we going to establish Shri Krishna
within ourselves?

00:10:50.994 --> 00:10:57.846
He, Himself has said, that whenever there
is a downfall of dharma -

00:10:58.047 --> 00:11:03.869
dharma doesn’t mean what we understand
as Hinduism, Christianity

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:07.794
or Islamic nonsense - it is not.

00:11:07.995 --> 00:11:20.630
Dharma means, our primordial taboos that
are built-in in the human beings.

00:11:21.595 --> 00:11:26.026
About these, I think aboriginals knew
better than we.

00:11:26.227 --> 00:11:30.091
But then what we did, we dominated them

00:11:30.292 --> 00:11:35.845
and also they had to change their style
of life.

00:11:36.046 --> 00:11:39.758
The primordial taboos are only understood

00:11:39.959 --> 00:11:47.026
if people are trying to understand oneself

00:11:47.227 --> 00:11:53.630
or else, whatever has come to them through
tradition.

00:11:53.884 --> 00:11:57.871
Now, Sahaj Dharma is a little bit
different,

00:11:58.072 --> 00:12:08.429
in the sense that it’s much higher than
the Sahaj ideas that we talk of,

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:16.136
but it’s much higher than even what Shri
Krishna said or Shri Rama said.

00:12:16.337 --> 00:12:21.889
First Shri Rama thought, best is to give
them disciplines.

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:28.577
People should be serious about life,
have full idea

00:12:28.778 --> 00:12:33.433
about their own being, they should
respect themselves.

00:12:33.634 --> 00:12:40.759
All these things were written down long
time back.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:44.905
Also, people, basically when they were
good people,

00:12:45.106 --> 00:12:50.016
they understood that whatever is bad
for us, we should not do.

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:53.123
These are primordial taboos.

00:12:53.324 --> 00:12:58.165
Now, these primordial taboos are built-in
within us.

00:12:58.366 --> 00:13:06.675
Now, supposing I say don’t drink, you will
go on drinking.

00:13:06.937 --> 00:13:11.067
If I say don’t tell lies, you will tell
lies.

00:13:11.268 --> 00:13:16.465
It’s the human nature, you see, is to go
against primordial taboo

00:13:16.666 --> 00:13:19.372
because they think now, they have freedom,

00:13:19.573 --> 00:13:22.365
freedom to do what they like.

00:13:22.566 --> 00:13:26.830
You are free people. Actually they are not.

00:13:27.031 --> 00:13:35.098
They are under the spell of all the kinds
of allurement, you can call it,

00:13:35.319 --> 00:13:42.040
or temptations, which are against human
life.

00:13:42.241 --> 00:13:49.392
And it’s very natural to be a person
of Dharma.

00:13:49.593 --> 00:13:54.202
Small children mostly have it. For example,
I’ve seen children,

00:13:54.403 --> 00:13:57.957
they feel very shy to take out their
clothes,

00:13:58.158 --> 00:14:00.303
even small, small boys, I’ve seen.

00:14:00.504 --> 00:14:07.886
They won’t take out their clothes in
the presence of others. They feel shy.

00:14:08.156 --> 00:14:10.274
So, all these are described like

00:14:10.474 --> 00:14:14.559
“Ya Devi Sarva Bhuteshu Lajja Rupena
Samsthita”.

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:20.499
So, you should be shy, you should be humble

00:14:21.114 --> 00:14:24.853
and respect your body – it’s very
important.

00:14:25.054 --> 00:14:32.506
In these modern times, exposure of body is
regarded as a great achievement of women.

00:14:32.707 --> 00:14:34.873
They are trying to become aboriginals, you
see.

00:14:35.074 --> 00:14:39.784
That time they never had these ideas and
they were not so confused, you see.

00:14:39.985 --> 00:14:43.218
So, even if their women were scantily
dressed,

00:14:43.419 --> 00:14:47.354
it didn’t mean that it was some sort
of a sex

00:14:47.555 --> 00:14:53.397
or some sort of an attraction for men

00:14:53.598 --> 00:14:57.438
or men behaving in funny manners

00:14:57.639 --> 00:15:02.490
to show that they have a special attraction
for women.

00:15:02.691 --> 00:15:05.515
I mean, why should you?

00:15:07.019 --> 00:15:12.884
It is absolutely absurd that men should be
attracted to women

00:15:13.085 --> 00:15:15.901
and women should be attracted to men -

00:15:16.102 --> 00:15:21.270
and on the road, on the street, you go,
you see, just that going on!

00:15:21.471 --> 00:15:27.391
This adharma is the worst I think, it’s
a curse.

00:15:27.621 --> 00:15:29.427
Because after coming to Sahaja Yoga also

00:15:29.627 --> 00:15:31.763
people start doing this nonsense, you know.

00:15:31.964 --> 00:15:34.132
They should all go to lunatic asylum,
I think,

00:15:34.333 --> 00:15:37.009
they are no good for Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:42.783
But dharma gets established as soon as you
have the light of the Spirit.

00:15:42.984 --> 00:15:52.438
At the time of Shri Rama, He had to put
down: A, B, C, D, E, F.

00:15:52.639 --> 00:16:00.412
At the time of Moses, also, He had to put
down ten commandments -

00:16:00.613 --> 00:16:05.788
but Krishna thought the other way round -

00:16:05.989 --> 00:16:12.947
to establish a Dharma of pure love, pure
love.

00:16:14.278 --> 00:16:21.309
So, because He wanted that Shri Rama’s
taboos were forced on people,

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:26.711
just like Islamic, just like Christians -
never works.

00:16:26.912 --> 00:16:30.183
So, He thought better to ask them in their
freedom,

00:16:30.384 --> 00:16:33.727
they must develop pure love.

00:16:33.928 --> 00:16:41.035
Radha, who was with Him, as His power,
is called as Alladha dayini.

00:16:41.236 --> 00:16:46.885
She’s the one who gives joy. Pure joy!

00:16:48.604 --> 00:16:55.836
So, all these limited type of attractions
end up in trouble.

00:16:56.412 --> 00:16:59.563
Now, drinking is against you, you know
that.

00:16:59.764 --> 00:17:04.626
Today they are talking about tobacco,
tomorrow they’ll talk of drinking

00:17:04.827 --> 00:17:10.821
when they will find so many people
suffering from horrible livers and dying.

00:17:11.022 --> 00:17:13.158
Then they will taboo it.

00:17:13.359 --> 00:17:17.153
But it’s a natural taboo for your body.

00:17:17.354 --> 00:17:22.794
If you do something all the time which is
not good for you,

00:17:22.995 --> 00:17:28.699
for your good life, you are becoming
adharmic.

00:17:30.027 --> 00:17:32.979
This is to be understood very clearly

00:17:33.179 --> 00:17:44.245
that the Sahaja Dharma is that you are
just free -

00:17:44.445 --> 00:17:49.045
complete freedom from lust, greed and all
nonsense.

00:17:49.246 --> 00:17:53.372
You are above it. You are above this.

00:17:53.573 --> 00:17:56.947
Sahaj Dharma is above the Dharma

00:17:57.047 --> 00:18:02.042
established by Shri
Krishna or by Shri Rama.

00:18:02.259 --> 00:18:05.020
Because you have reached that stage.

00:18:05.221 --> 00:18:10.727
It’s in complete freedom you have to be
dharmic.

00:18:10.928 --> 00:18:14.403
Whatever is not good for you, you should
not do.

00:18:14.604 --> 00:18:21.944
I don’t have to tell you that you don’t do
this or you don’t do that.

00:18:22.161 --> 00:18:25.250
Whatever I say may not be acceptable

00:18:25.451 --> 00:18:28.446
but immediately your vibrations will tell
you.

00:18:28.647 --> 00:18:35.322
This is Sahaj Dharma. In the Sahaj Dharma
you get rid of all kinds of,

00:18:35.523 --> 00:18:37.993
as they say: (Hindi words) kaama, krodha,
mada, matsa, lobha, moha.

00:18:38.194 --> 00:19:00.529
Means – lust, anger, attractions, then –
greed;

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:09.342
that’s very important, greed – greed and
attractions.

00:19:09.766 --> 00:19:18.287
Now, if you understand how people are
greedy; greedy for what?

00:19:18.488 --> 00:19:23.146
This America is dying of consumerism, you
see.

00:19:23.376 --> 00:19:26.196
Now, see the trick of the trade:

00:19:26.397 --> 00:19:32.948
In America, you can borrow any amount
of money from the bank, no problem.

00:19:33.149 --> 00:19:40.107
Now, even if you don’t borrow, they’ll send
you a letter,

00:19:40.308 --> 00:19:45.359
“Why don’t you take twenty thousand
checks we are sending you, why not have it?

00:19:45.573 --> 00:19:53.295
Ah, very rich you’ll become, you see – it’s
very nice to take the loan.”

00:19:53.496 --> 00:19:57.699
I was told some people used to come
to Ganapatipule after taking loans.

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:01.147
I said, “Stop that nonsense.”

00:20:01.348 --> 00:20:06.437
So they take the loan and then they come
to Ganapatipule.

00:20:06.638 --> 00:20:13.068
All the time their mind is: “How will I pay
this loan, how will I manage?”

00:20:13.269 --> 00:20:15.917
All the time the attention is distracted,

00:20:16.118 --> 00:20:22.968
even when you want to do something good
to yourself by coming to Ganapatipule.

00:20:23.169 --> 00:20:27.297
So, such a mind is not free.

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:37.572
The free mind is that which has attention
completely enlightened by the Spirit.

00:20:38.287 --> 00:20:45.534
But problem is we are still rising out
of this human bondage

00:20:45.735 --> 00:20:50.778
to a higher life of realization.

00:20:51.754 --> 00:20:58.001
And when we are going to that level, we
have to realize

00:20:58.202 --> 00:21:03.534
that we have to give up all these shackles,

00:21:03.735 --> 00:21:07.452
all these horrible things within us.

00:21:07.653 --> 00:21:13.576
Like a bird, when it is born out
of the egg,

00:21:13.777 --> 00:21:17.908
shakes out all the parts of the egg.

00:21:18.109 --> 00:21:21.872
Your brothers, your sisters, your father,
your mother, your husband;

00:21:22.073 --> 00:21:28.380
everybody – they’ll try to put you down.

00:21:28.581 --> 00:21:30.699
Now, if they are drinking, they’ll say,
“Come along,

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:34.298
you better have something to drink, you
are not social,

00:21:34.499 --> 00:21:39.605
you are useless, you are not up to date.
What is this nonsense?”

00:21:39.806 --> 00:21:47.377
That’s how a fashion starts and this
collective action of fashion

00:21:47.578 --> 00:21:53.636
didn’t come from Shri Krishna and not
in Sahaj.

00:21:53.837 --> 00:22:01.773
In Sahaj, you are absolutely free from all
these nonsenses.

00:22:02.341 --> 00:22:04.779
If you want, you can wear a good dress,

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:09.757
if you don’t want you need not. You are
free.

00:22:10.273 --> 00:22:14.148
You are free from money bondage. This is
very important.

00:22:14.349 --> 00:22:17.266
Money bondage is another thing. I know
some Sahaja Yogis

00:22:17.467 --> 00:22:20.983
who came to Sahaja Yoga trying to make
money out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:21.184 --> 00:22:23.872
You came to Sahaja Yoga for what?

00:22:24.073 --> 00:22:26.713
To get out of that money bondage.

00:22:26.914 --> 00:22:32.694
In the Sahaj Dharma, to you money is
nothing but the dust of your feet.

00:22:33.345 --> 00:22:35.228
Nothing so important.

00:22:35.429 --> 00:22:43.181
Then, we have such a collective sense
of accepting nonsense.

00:22:43.382 --> 00:22:48.217
That has to be dropped out, especially
in America, I was surprised.

00:22:48.418 --> 00:22:53.753
Also in England. A fellow came as a hippie.

00:23:00.508 --> 00:23:06.206
His hair was looking like some monkey,

00:23:06.407 --> 00:23:09.852
monkey’s better I must say, I don’t know
like what,

00:23:10.053 --> 00:23:15.048
all put together like a, you can say…

00:23:15.249 --> 00:23:18.738
I mean, there is nothing to compare, I tell
you.

00:23:18.939 --> 00:23:23.010
So I asked him, “Why are you having such
hair?”

00:23:23.211 --> 00:23:25.242
He said, “Because I want to be primitive.

00:23:25.443 --> 00:23:28.381
Now, we have to get to the primitiveness.”

00:23:28.582 --> 00:23:30.860
I said, “But your brain is modern,

00:23:31.061 --> 00:23:32.984
what is the use of growing your hair like
that?

00:23:33.185 --> 00:23:37.431
You think you can become primitive?
You cannot!”

00:23:39.759 --> 00:23:43.324
Then afterwards I learned that he died.

00:23:43.525 --> 00:23:48.742
Another one like that came and he didn’t
die,

00:23:48.942 --> 00:23:51.641
but went to lunatic asylum.

00:23:51.842 --> 00:23:55.681
Like that I met many, but why do you do it?

00:23:55.882 --> 00:23:58.745
Because that’s the fashion.

00:23:58.946 --> 00:24:07.113
Now Italy, you know, is prospering because
of all kinds of designers.

00:24:07.429 --> 00:24:15.453
Now there is a joke about the new rich
people, in Russia especially.

00:24:15.654 --> 00:24:18.686
Russians are not like that, normally.

00:24:18.887 --> 00:24:23.224
They don’t accept something because it is
a fashion.

00:24:23.425 --> 00:24:33.551
So, one fellow said that: “My God, you lost
your hand in that accident!”

00:24:33.752 --> 00:24:40.220
“Doesn’t matter, but I lost my very
expensive watch from Switzerland.”

00:24:40.421 --> 00:24:43.465
“Really? What?” “It was a Rolex.”

00:24:43.666 --> 00:24:45.868
Doesn’t matter if the hand is gone.

00:24:46.069 --> 00:24:49.828
The Rolex is gone! Rolex is the fashion.

00:24:50.029 --> 00:24:54.640
[Can you remove him down, this one,
because people can’t see you.]

00:24:55.178 --> 00:24:59.540
So these are new rich people who have
money.

00:24:59.741 --> 00:25:05.949
(Dog is on the stage: It’s alright now,
he’ll be able. Come along, come along. Ah.

00:25:06.324 --> 00:25:10.483
Sit down, sit down. Now go down)

00:25:17.662 --> 00:25:19.531
They (the dogs) don’t follow any fashions,

00:25:19.732 --> 00:25:23.788
I have not seen dogs taking to any
fashions.

00:25:23.989 --> 00:25:28.887
Monkeys is taking - I mean, supposing, you
see the Italian designers

00:25:29.087 --> 00:25:33.590
make something special for them, they
won’t think much of it.

00:25:33.791 --> 00:25:40.894
Maybe their masters might buy it, but not
these animals.

00:25:41.095 --> 00:25:43.642
Now, we don’t have to become animals
of course,

00:25:43.843 --> 00:25:48.600
but we don’t also have to become
slaves of fashions.

00:25:48.801 --> 00:25:51.355
So there are some shops which are very
expensive.

00:25:51.555 --> 00:25:54.791
Why? Because they are designers.

00:25:54.992 --> 00:25:58.640
So you move about telling everybody, “See,
I am wearing this thing

00:25:58.841 --> 00:26:02.495
from a designer shop, this is from designer
shop.”

00:26:02.696 --> 00:26:05.258
That means, what about you?

00:26:05.459 --> 00:26:11.330
You have no sense of designs, you have
no sense of understanding

00:26:11.531 --> 00:26:14.637
what you need and what you don’t need.

00:26:14.838 --> 00:26:18.442
And nowadays most of them are in jail also,
sorry to say,

00:26:18.643 --> 00:26:24.250
but they have money and they have made
money by befooling you.

00:26:24.451 --> 00:26:30.591
Specially in America I was surprised that
they were selling most of the things

00:26:30.792 --> 00:26:34.616
which were coming from Italy designs,
Italian designs,

00:26:34.817 --> 00:26:40.227
written down Italian design, so they were
buying it, Italian design.

00:26:40.966 --> 00:26:47.034
I was surprised that such artistic things
they create

00:26:47.235 --> 00:26:53.004
that are available everywhere, such
beautiful things.

00:26:53.205 --> 00:27:00.618
But what they believe in, is some sort
of a group madness.

00:27:00.819 --> 00:27:06.358
Everybody wearing the same kind of design
is from this or that.

00:27:06.613 --> 00:27:09.824
This is not Sahaj Dharma. We are not
slaves of anything.

00:27:10.025 --> 00:27:14.126
We are free people. We have not to accept
any design or anything.

00:27:14.327 --> 00:27:19.110
Ah, it is there, is there! Let the stupid
follow that.

00:27:19.311 --> 00:27:21.944
We are Sahaja Yogis.

00:27:22.145 --> 00:27:26.774
Now, this also prevails among people who
are supposed to be sadhus,

00:27:26.975 --> 00:27:30.403
they all dress up the same way.

00:27:30.604 --> 00:27:33.424
How can you make out who is who?

00:27:33.625 --> 00:27:37.063
In Sahaja Yoga, we don’t want you to dress
up the same way,

00:27:37.264 --> 00:27:41.249
look the same way, cut your hair the same
way. No.

00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:44.824
You have to be individuals, because you
are free,

00:27:45.025 --> 00:27:50.556
but that doesn’t mean - freedom is always
supported by wisdom -

00:27:50.771 --> 00:27:55.087
that doesn’t mean that you do what you
like.

00:27:55.288 --> 00:28:00.658
All kinds of funny things happen when
a person doesn’t know

00:28:00.859 --> 00:28:05.830
what is the light of the Spirit.
In the light of the Spirit,

00:28:06.031 --> 00:28:12.986
you don’t get involved into this kind
of collective madness that is going on.

00:28:13.187 --> 00:28:16.437
We are so collective in mad things.

00:28:16.638 --> 00:28:21.776
I wish they could be collective more
in wise things.

00:28:21.977 --> 00:28:28.210
Wisdom is very important and a joy-giving
quality of Radhaji,

00:28:28.411 --> 00:28:32.271
Ahlada Dayini Shakti, has to come within
us.

00:28:32.472 --> 00:28:37.543
Means, when we meet another person
in the collectivity,

00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:42.342
another person should feel happy meeting
you.

00:28:42.543 --> 00:28:47.328
So He taught the Dharma of love.

00:28:47.529 --> 00:28:53.629
Love is not there if you discard because
he is black or because he is brown,

00:28:53.830 --> 00:29:00.644
because he is white. It’s very
superficial -

00:29:00.845 --> 00:29:04.972
what is black, white and yellow? I don’t
understand.

00:29:05.173 --> 00:29:09.818
Here they go to the sea shores to make
themselves black

00:29:10.019 --> 00:29:18.350
and there they say, “We don’t want to have
any blacks,” specially for Americans.

00:29:18.551 --> 00:29:25.156
I think this kind of separation I found
there,

00:29:25.357 --> 00:29:30.166
among the blacks and the whites, I really
wept.

00:29:30.367 --> 00:29:33.811
I went to Harlem. Sahaja yogis said,
“Mother, will you go to Harlem?”

00:29:34.011 --> 00:29:37.975
I said, “Why not, I’m black. If you call
me black, I’m black.

00:29:38.176 --> 00:29:42.451
If you call me white, I’m white. If you
call me yellow, I’m yellow.

00:29:42.652 --> 00:29:45.841
So, I’m going.” And there I had a lecture,
you know,

00:29:46.042 --> 00:29:48.598
so many people were there, really I cannot
forget.

00:29:48.799 --> 00:29:56.721
It is one of the most famous place that
there is built in that hall

00:29:56.936 --> 00:30:05.600
and the same hall is built in Australia
where I had addressed many people.

00:30:05.801 --> 00:30:11.319
I thought, “Just look at this!” They said,
“Mother, the Australians copied from us.”

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:15.048
Now, these people, so sweet, so beautiful,
I tell you.

00:30:15.249 --> 00:30:20.871
I could see their heart, I could feel it
and the fellow was trying to compere.

00:30:21.072 --> 00:30:23.994
After my lecture he just came, he hugged
me, kissed me.

00:30:24.195 --> 00:30:27.924
I mean, he would have even minced me,
a little boy

00:30:28.125 --> 00:30:33.381
about twenty-two years of age; such love
he felt.

00:30:33.582 --> 00:30:36.767
And he said, “Mother, next time You come,
You are going to come to Harlem.”

00:30:36.968 --> 00:30:39.673
But I am told that hall is closed.

00:30:39.874 --> 00:30:48.020
So the Americans system somehow or another
goes against democracy,

00:30:48.794 --> 00:30:55.987
not only against democracy but against
what Abraham Lincoln wanted.

00:30:56.188 --> 00:31:01.065
They had such a great man there

00:31:01.466 --> 00:31:05.132
and there is a little street I saw in his
name.

00:31:05.333 --> 00:31:13.860
Of course in Washington they say they have
some nice, beautiful statues.

00:31:14.067 --> 00:31:18.785
But otherwise his principles are finished,

00:31:18.986 --> 00:31:26.442
his ideals are finished because somehow
or other,

00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:29.074
some people came and wrote against -

00:31:29.275 --> 00:31:34.151
from England especially - against the black
people.

00:31:37.604 --> 00:31:42.517
What business they have to write against
something that is created by God?

00:31:42.718 --> 00:31:45.591
If there are the same colours everywhere,

00:31:45.792 --> 00:31:48.780
they all will look like military people.

00:31:48.981 --> 00:31:51.611
They have to have different colors,

00:31:51.812 --> 00:31:54.098
they have to have different hues.

00:31:54.298 --> 00:31:57.444
See, look at the trees, look at
the flowers.

00:31:57.645 --> 00:32:02.761
And look at the different hues the sky has,

00:32:02.962 --> 00:32:06.216
just to make us happy – Alladha.

00:32:06.417 --> 00:32:13.008
What gives you happiness is variety.
Variety is a sign of beauty.

00:32:13.209 --> 00:32:18.464
If there is no variety, it’s so boring
I tell you, so very boring.

00:32:18.665 --> 00:32:23.702
But they are very proud of it and they
think no end of themselves.

00:32:23.903 --> 00:32:28.200
They think they are very great people, they
have a sense of superiority,

00:32:28.401 --> 00:32:31.877
because they have a certain type of nose

00:32:32.077 --> 00:32:37.399
or maybe certain type of lips or maybe
certain types of hair.

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:41.431
Such stupid things they are and you join
hands with them.

00:32:41.632 --> 00:32:43.484
How can you join hands with them?

00:32:43.685 --> 00:32:47.345
You want your freedom? Then be a free
person.

00:32:47.546 --> 00:32:53.599
In the freedom you have to have variety,
very important.

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:58.040
I would say that, now, the Sahaja Yogis who
are going back to America

00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:04.330
should have a new style of drive: go
to the black people.

00:33:04.531 --> 00:33:09.652
I was very happy to see the South American
seminar,

00:33:09.853 --> 00:33:15.766
that they had taken specially to aboriginal
people.

00:33:15.967 --> 00:33:18.745
They went and met them. I have met them
also

00:33:18.946 --> 00:33:21.312
and I was so surprised

00:33:21.513 --> 00:33:25.260
that they immediately said, “Mother,
You are spiritual, we know,

00:33:25.461 --> 00:33:28.900
but can You solve our problem?” I said,
“What’s your problem?”

00:33:29.101 --> 00:33:33.441
“Very simple, we have a land.”
“It’s alright, then?”

00:33:33.642 --> 00:33:36.558
“Very little land, five, six acres of land

00:33:36.759 --> 00:33:39.745
that belongs to us where the sage grows.”

00:33:39.946 --> 00:33:46.433
Sage is a kind of a, according to them,
is a holy plant. All right.

00:33:46.634 --> 00:33:52.655
“Now, we always meet, all of us, there
for different festivals

00:33:52.856 --> 00:33:55.721
because we regard that land as a holy
land.”

00:33:55.922 --> 00:33:58.018
They know so many things, you know.

00:33:58.219 --> 00:34:02.051
This is a holy land - there were vibrations
for that.

00:34:02.251 --> 00:34:06.723
So they always used to meet. So natural!

00:34:06.924 --> 00:34:09.235
“So, what has happened now, what is your
problem?”

00:34:09.436 --> 00:34:14.590
“The government has sold this land, this
American government, to an Indian.”

00:34:14.791 --> 00:34:18.680
I said, “To an Indian?” “Yes, so can you
request this Indian

00:34:18.881 --> 00:34:21.271
to return it to us? We’ll pay him the
money.”

00:34:21.472 --> 00:34:23.447
I said, “What’s the name of the Indian?”

00:34:23.647 --> 00:34:26.554
They told me the name, I said, “My God!

00:34:26.755 --> 00:34:29.376
He is a Sindhi, Sindhi!

00:34:29.577 --> 00:34:33.601
He won’t leave you even one single pai,
is he going to give you this?

00:34:33.802 --> 00:34:39.642
I’m sorry, I may be Divine or I may be
anything, I can’t help you.”

00:34:40.173 --> 00:34:44.216
But I was surprised nobody raised a voice
against it.

00:34:44.417 --> 00:34:47.130
They should have raised voice. They should
have told the government,

00:34:47.331 --> 00:34:50.802
“Please return their land. Why do you want
to have it?

00:34:51.003 --> 00:34:56.775
Why want to grab it?” As it is all
the Americans are immigrants.

00:34:56.976 --> 00:35:02.987
They don’t belong to that place, that they
were not owners of that place,

00:35:03.188 --> 00:35:06.048
they’d gone – they are immigrants.

00:35:06.249 --> 00:35:10.029
So they have no right to keep somebody’s
land like that

00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:12.360
and then to think they are superior.
It’s very nice,

00:35:12.561 --> 00:35:15.392
somebody enters your house and thinks he is
very superior

00:35:15.593 --> 00:35:19.411
and drives out all the people
of the family.

00:35:19.612 --> 00:35:24.532
That is what has happened in America and
just opposite is Sahaj Dharma.

00:35:24.733 --> 00:35:32.298
With Sahaj Dharma, you take people into
your heart, you love them.

00:35:33.758 --> 00:35:38.931
Your love flows all the time, your
compassion flows all the time.

00:35:39.132 --> 00:35:43.430
To me it’s a problem, this body is more
compassionate than myself.

00:35:43.631 --> 00:35:47.500
I don’t even think of compassion and this
body just grasps everything.

00:35:47.722 --> 00:35:51.558
It wants to solve the problem of others

00:35:51.759 --> 00:35:55.817
but I don’t think you can have that kind
of a body, you shouldn’t have.

00:35:56.018 --> 00:36:00.757
But, at least you should have a heart
which is open.

00:36:00.958 --> 00:36:03.729
You see on the street somebody who is
a dark fellow.

00:36:03.929 --> 00:36:13.651
I like about the black Americans, that
once I got down in one airport,

00:36:13.852 --> 00:36:19.404
so one gentleman, black gentleman said,
“Hello darling, how are You?

00:36:19.605 --> 00:36:22.725
How are You here? Very happy to see You!”

00:36:22.926 --> 00:36:25.831
“I’m happy to see you. How are you?”

00:36:26.032 --> 00:36:36.246
Then once I was traveling in... what was
the airport? Ursula was with me.

00:36:36.447 --> 00:36:42.831
So he looked at me, one fellow, very tall,
hefty, fat, you know.

00:36:43.032 --> 00:36:47.083
He said, “Ah! Are You back again?” “Ah”.

00:36:47.284 --> 00:36:50.818
I said, “I’m back. You know me?”
“Of course, of course, I know You.”

00:36:51.019 --> 00:36:54.357
He had never met me, I had never known him.

00:36:56.706 --> 00:37:01.211
But I felt happy, I felt very happy.

00:37:01.412 --> 00:37:04.476
That’s the best way to meet people.

00:37:04.677 --> 00:37:09.721
Supposing you are walking on the street,
you see some black gentleman going.

00:37:09.922 --> 00:37:14.063
It’s a terrible life there, I tell you,
it’s a terrible life for them.

00:37:14.264 --> 00:37:19.577
I’ve known, I’ve read books on them, I’ve
cried and wept and I felt very sorry.

00:37:19.778 --> 00:37:23.233
So, as a Sahaja yogi, you should just jump
at them

00:37:23.434 --> 00:37:27.593
and you should say, “Hello, how are you?”
Shake hands with them.

00:37:27.793 --> 00:37:31.287
They won’t cut your throat, I can tell you
this.

00:37:32.862 --> 00:37:36.478
In criminality, I don’t know who is more
criminal in America,

00:37:36.679 --> 00:37:40.683
whether they are the blacks or
the whites, competing.

00:37:40.884 --> 00:37:44.133
But, if you are kind and if you are loving,

00:37:44.334 --> 00:37:47.436
you can remove that part of criminality
which is within them

00:37:47.637 --> 00:37:53.211
because hatred can be only washed away
by pure love.

00:37:53.448 --> 00:37:58.849
But people think they are very cunning,
very superior in cunningness, of course.

00:37:59.050 --> 00:38:02.684
Otherwise, what is their superiority?

00:38:03.879 --> 00:38:09.089
Only this complexion, this white complexion
is the worst of all.

00:38:09.290 --> 00:38:14.755
I was very fair, very fair, till I got
married, or for some time,

00:38:14.956 --> 00:38:17.870
and then I started becoming darker and
darker.

00:38:18.071 --> 00:38:21.458
Because white complexion gets all kinds
of, see...

00:38:21.659 --> 00:38:25.792
the light you put on me, I absorb, I get
a black spot.

00:38:25.993 --> 00:38:29.424
So it’s not a very great thing to be white,
I don’t think so.

00:38:29.625 --> 00:38:33.864
It looks very funny and pale and joyless.

00:38:34.065 --> 00:38:39.441
But no use going to the sea, making your
body, I think brown,

00:38:39.642 --> 00:38:48.600
brown, not so black, brown and then
suffering from cancer of the skin.

00:38:48.801 --> 00:38:53.798
This kind of stupidity is also very much
fashionable.

00:38:53.999 --> 00:38:58.382
Now, in collectivity, how much do we get
impressed

00:38:58.582 --> 00:39:02.405
by this, we should be on the watch.

00:39:02.865 --> 00:39:06.979
I saw my granddaughter was wearing
a sleeveless dress.

00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:09.342
I told her, “Better you shouldn’t wear
a sleeveless dress.”

00:39:09.543 --> 00:39:12.774
She says, “It’s very hot, I feel very hot.”
She’s young.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.466
I said, “But see, these are two very
important chakras.

00:39:16.667 --> 00:39:21.214
If you expose them, then you’ll have
a problem.”

00:39:21.415 --> 00:39:27.009
She doesn’t like to wear dresses which are
above the knee,

00:39:27.210 --> 00:39:29.362
but she says, “People wear even above
the knee.”

00:39:29.563 --> 00:39:35.948
I said, “Knees, they are very important
chakras, we should keep them closed,

00:39:36.149 --> 00:39:40.119
otherwise if they are affected, we’ll have
knee trouble.”

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:43.326
Immediately she changed – immediately.

00:39:43.526 --> 00:39:47.935
“Mother, I’ll wear blouse from inside and
something from outside.”

00:39:48.136 --> 00:39:54.324
Immediately. Because she knew this is
a natural primordial taboo

00:39:54.525 --> 00:40:02.760
that we should not expose our these two
chakras and these chakras.

00:40:02.961 --> 00:40:10.940
But, nowadays, the more you have long
legs, I don’t know,

00:40:11.141 --> 00:40:14.008
they have shorter clothes.

00:40:14.209 --> 00:40:17.083
And I don’t understand what is in the legs,

00:40:17.284 --> 00:40:20.806
the whole beauty is in the legs or what?

00:40:21.015 --> 00:40:26.101
So, I’ve met one lady who traveled with me.

00:40:26.302 --> 00:40:30.145
She was wearing a burkha because she was
a Moslem

00:40:30.346 --> 00:40:34.786
and by the time we landed in London, she
took out the burkha

00:40:34.987 --> 00:40:39.139
and the dress was much above the knees.

00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:43.057
I said, “What kind of Muslim woman is she?

00:40:43.258 --> 00:40:49.507
She’s worse than even Christians because
they wouldn’t wear such a thing.

00:40:49.708 --> 00:40:52.892
You know, to come out of the aeroplane,

00:40:53.092 --> 00:40:55.077
you have to come down on the staircase.”

00:40:55.278 --> 00:41:01.531
No “Lajja”, no shame, nothing,
shamelessness!

00:41:01.951 --> 00:41:09.418
So, Sahaj Dharma is that you have shame,
you have sense of shame.

00:41:09.619 --> 00:41:12.549
What you talk to others, what you say
to others,

00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:19.779
how you behave towards them, in the Sahaj
Dharma is Alladha dayini.

00:41:20.009 --> 00:41:24.665
If something is not Alladha dayini, keep
quiet. Don’t say.

00:41:24.866 --> 00:41:29.692
What is the need? What is there to be
sarcastic?

00:41:29.893 --> 00:41:34.940
Showing off your brains in your sarcasm.

00:41:36.405 --> 00:41:40.211
It’s not a sign of good breeding

00:41:40.412 --> 00:41:45.200
that you talk sarcastically to others
in a sharp way.

00:41:45.401 --> 00:41:49.537
But if you talk sweetly, what’s the harm?

00:41:49.738 --> 00:41:55.099
This sweetness comes from Radhaji.

00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:58.173
Now, of course they have misused Her

00:41:58.373 --> 00:42:03.053
and made it into a sort of a Romeo and
Juliet business. It was not that way.

00:42:03.254 --> 00:42:09.509
She was a very pure woman and She
was Mahalakshmi.

00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:16.729
So, to be a Mahalaksmi, after coming
to Sahaja Yoga, you should know

00:42:16.930 --> 00:42:23.233
that you should dress up in a way that’s
perfectly alright.

00:42:23.434 --> 00:42:32.282
Once I remember, I was in a big party
and one gentleman came

00:42:32.496 --> 00:42:36.804
and he sat down, “Aaaaaah!” I said,
“What happened?”

00:42:37.005 --> 00:42:41.950
“What a relief, Mother, Mrs. Shrivastava,
to see You.

00:42:42.151 --> 00:42:49.472
See these women, I’m fed up. But You
came, I felt such a relief.”

00:42:49.844 --> 00:42:54.003
I said, “What is so relieving?” “You are
so serene.”

00:42:54.204 --> 00:43:00.448
So, women are serene in Sahaj Dharma.

00:43:00.649 --> 00:43:06.098
They are not stupid, frivolous, laughing
at anything.

00:43:06.299 --> 00:43:11.633
That’s not the way for a woman. Anything
happens, they must laugh.

00:43:11.833 --> 00:43:14.940
I mean, there is something laughable,
alright,

00:43:15.141 --> 00:43:18.422
but some things are not even laughable,
they laugh.

00:43:18.629 --> 00:43:23.646
That’s not the way. That can be ridiculous
also, can ridicule others.

00:43:23.847 --> 00:43:30.440
But, laugh of appreciation, laugh
of enjoyment,

00:43:30.641 --> 00:43:36.647
is so pure and creates such a beautiful
atmosphere.

00:43:36.848 --> 00:43:43.706
I think the whole ecological problem is in
our brains and your upbringing.

00:43:43.907 --> 00:43:46.892
It is not outside.

00:43:47.564 --> 00:43:52.845
It is inside us, which is reflected
outside.

00:43:53.046 --> 00:43:58.091
In Ganesha Puja I’m going to tell you how
we are so closely related to Mother Earth

00:43:58.292 --> 00:44:02.428
and how the Mother Earth and the atmosphere
reacts

00:44:02.629 --> 00:44:07.046
to our behavior, to how we live.

00:44:07.247 --> 00:44:13.746
In the Sahaj Dharma, you give up lust and
greed very easily, that I know.

00:44:13.947 --> 00:44:16.499
I mean, if they can’t even give up that,

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:19.306
then they should not call themselves Sahaja
Yogis.

00:44:19.507 --> 00:44:22.882
The first thing you give up is lust and
greed.

00:44:23.083 --> 00:44:26.140
I find it among young people now,

00:44:26.341 --> 00:44:34.325
that those who come to Sahaja Yoga
become really very free people.

00:44:34.526 --> 00:44:38.384
They don’t run after women.

00:44:38.793 --> 00:44:41.294
Women don’t run after men.

00:44:41.495 --> 00:44:45.425
They are together, they sit together, talk
together, laugh together,

00:44:45.626 --> 00:44:48.848
but it is purity that is there.

00:44:49.049 --> 00:44:55.144
In the Koran it is described that when
Kyama will come,

00:44:55.755 --> 00:45:00.010
beautiful women and beautiful men will
be there,

00:45:00.211 --> 00:45:03.502
but they’ll have no lust and greed, they’ll
be pure.

00:45:03.703 --> 00:45:10.657
It is today, you can see – that lust and
greed is finished

00:45:10.858 --> 00:45:15.170
in most of you – most of you. Automatically
it is finished

00:45:15.371 --> 00:45:21.766
and now you can see for yourself that
you’re free of this bondage.

00:45:22.625 --> 00:45:26.633
Then our marriages are coming tomorrow.

00:45:36.337 --> 00:45:45.318
In the Sahaj Dharma, first thing is very
important is forgiveness.

00:45:45.519 --> 00:45:50.439
If somebody cannot forgive, then he cannot
be a Sahaja Yogi -

00:45:51.352 --> 00:45:55.913
forgiveness. How this forgiveness comes in

00:45:56.114 --> 00:46:01.309
is by forgetting the past. Otherwise you’ll
go on saying,

00:46:01.509 --> 00:46:04.860
“This person tortured me, that person
tortured me,

00:46:05.061 --> 00:46:09.832
he was very mean to me, he was that to me,
he did this to me.”

00:46:10.033 --> 00:46:15.395
Shows that you are not of that calibre
to understand Sahaja Yoga -

00:46:15.596 --> 00:46:18.913
because you cannot forgive.

00:46:19.639 --> 00:46:22.808
What is there to remember? The present is
the best.

00:46:23.009 --> 00:46:28.154
Now if you are sitting here with me,
enjoying the Alladha dayini Shakti,

00:46:28.355 --> 00:46:31.714
that time if you are thinking about
the past, shows what?

00:46:31.915 --> 00:46:34.988
That you are not of the calibre.

00:46:35.189 --> 00:46:40.524
To be the calibre of Sahaja Yoga, you
should be free of your past.

00:46:40.725 --> 00:46:44.252
Finished. There's no need to confess.

00:46:44.453 --> 00:46:48.916
I know after Sahaja Yoga many people wrote
letters to me of confessions

00:46:49.117 --> 00:46:53.592
and I just said, “Baba, just burn these
letters.

00:46:53.793 --> 00:46:58.337
I don’t remember. I don’t want to read
anything about anyone.”

00:46:58.538 --> 00:47:00.897
So, there should be forgiveness.

00:47:01.098 --> 00:47:03.737
If there is forgiveness, you’ll be
surprised,

00:47:03.938 --> 00:47:08.575
you’ll feel very relieved and your married
life will be very happy.

00:47:08.776 --> 00:47:12.742
But if you try to remember something...
Alright,

00:47:12.943 --> 00:47:17.541
some marriages are really, really very
difficult, alright, so you get out.

00:47:17.742 --> 00:47:21.035
In Sahaja Yoga we have allowed complete
divorce,

00:47:21.235 --> 00:47:23.558
but must be with some reason,

00:47:23.759 --> 00:47:26.950
not because you think something is
superior.

00:47:27.191 --> 00:47:31.060
Now we have banned many countries

00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:33.088
from where we don’t want to have girls

00:47:33.289 --> 00:47:35.374
or from where we don’t want to have boys.

00:47:35.575 --> 00:47:38.209
What is the reason? With experience we
have learned,

00:47:38.425 --> 00:47:43.061
they are not marriage substance.

00:47:44.486 --> 00:47:48.446
Now, then better not marry.

00:47:48.647 --> 00:47:54.922
And if you marry then live like an ideal
Sahaja Yogi.

00:47:55.438 --> 00:47:58.439
Also, if you are a Sahaja Yogini,

00:47:58.639 --> 00:48:05.034
then you can carry on very much better
by forgiving all the time.

00:48:05.235 --> 00:48:08.124
Every time, when people tell me,
“Mother,

00:48:08.324 --> 00:48:10.487
You see, You must help me.” “Why?”

00:48:10.709 --> 00:48:14.671
“Because, You know, my husband doesn’t
give me any money.”

00:48:14.872 --> 00:48:17.874
I said, “Give him up. I don’t mind.

00:48:18.075 --> 00:48:20.866
He must give you money. Why doesn’t he
give you money?”

00:48:21.067 --> 00:48:24.357
If you talk to the husband, he’ll say,
“Mother, she’s very extravagant.”

00:48:24.558 --> 00:48:30.770
I said, “You better give up Sahaja Yoga
both of you and do what you like.”

00:48:31.023 --> 00:48:37.371
In Sahaj Dharma, the husband-wife’s
relation should be really romantic,

00:48:37.572 --> 00:48:39.674
should be really beautiful.

00:48:39.875 --> 00:48:43.147
It is not, you know, we talk of love and
all that here,

00:48:43.348 --> 00:48:47.411
very rarely people fall in love and carry
on with it.

00:48:47.612 --> 00:48:52.101
It’s a blessing if you really get that kind
of a feeling.

00:48:52.302 --> 00:48:55.825
But mostly it is a curse.

00:48:57.258 --> 00:49:01.120
So to fall in love is very good

00:49:01.321 --> 00:49:05.429
but that doesn’t mean you forget that you
are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:11.685
In that, Sahaja Yoga helps a lot, I think,
in your married life.

00:49:11.886 --> 00:49:17.268
Same, dharma is for your children, that you
bring up your children -

00:49:17.469 --> 00:49:22.386
not troubling them too much, but into
a free life.

00:49:22.587 --> 00:49:24.485
Let them use their wisdom.

00:49:24.686 --> 00:49:28.928
Sometimes I know children go astray and
try to follow wrong things.

00:49:29.129 --> 00:49:33.032
Then you must correct them, you must tell
them, it is your duty.

00:49:33.233 --> 00:49:35.751
They were not born out of the trees

00:49:35.952 --> 00:49:39.522
but they were born here, from the parents.

00:49:39.723 --> 00:49:43.275
So it is the duty of the parents to tell
them that this is wrong

00:49:43.476 --> 00:49:45.458
and this should not be done.

00:49:45.658 --> 00:49:48.655
It’s a very wrong thing, you should correct
that

00:49:48.856 --> 00:49:53.247
and that correction should be in a Sahaj
way.

00:49:54.841 --> 00:49:57.827
I’ll tell you an example.

00:49:59.498 --> 00:50:08.118
I had a problem once, with somebody
coming to me and saying,

00:50:08.319 --> 00:50:13.051
“Mother, I can’t do without smoking, I
have to smoke.”

00:50:13.252 --> 00:50:17.993
I said, “Better smoke then, but you can’t
be a Sahaja Yogi,

00:50:18.251 --> 00:50:21.671
because a smoking Sahaja Yogi is a funny
caricature, you know,

00:50:21.872 --> 00:50:24.828
I can’t think of a Sahaja Yogi smoking.

00:50:25.029 --> 00:50:30.353
How will I look if I start smoking like
that?” “Ah, horrible!”

00:50:30.554 --> 00:50:35.704
I said, “Then if you are my son, you cannot
smoke, it looks bad.”

00:50:35.905 --> 00:50:39.095
He gave up smoking, can you imagine?

00:50:39.296 --> 00:50:43.831
So, dealing with children, always make
yourself an example,

00:50:44.032 --> 00:50:47.064
yourself part and parcel of that event.

00:50:47.265 --> 00:50:50.790
So the children don’t feel, you know.

00:50:50.991 --> 00:51:00.093
This is something that I have talked
many-a-times.

00:51:00.294 --> 00:51:03.383
Children is one thing I tell you,

00:51:03.584 --> 00:51:07.720
they can give up everything but not your
love.

00:51:07.921 --> 00:51:14.647
If they know you love them, they will not
accept anything

00:51:14.847 --> 00:51:21.225
that will make you not love - not love
them.

00:51:21.426 --> 00:51:28.767
This is for definite, because children are
the best people who know about love.

00:51:28.968 --> 00:51:32.596
Of course, I don’t know, I feel that
in English language,

00:51:32.797 --> 00:51:39.205
I didn’t see many books about children
written beautiful, beautiful things.

00:51:39.406 --> 00:51:42.374
There was one book that was published
when I was in London:

00:51:42.575 --> 00:51:45.688
“The children talking about
the politicians”,

00:51:45.888 --> 00:51:51.566
and they published I think, 5000 books and
that very same day it was finished.

00:51:51.767 --> 00:51:58.031
So, talk to children, talk to them. You’ll
be amazed, they are full of honey.

00:51:58.232 --> 00:52:00.959
They have such nice, nice things with them

00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:05.791
and when they talk like that, then you
are amazed

00:52:05.992 --> 00:52:09.451
how they say things, how they talk
of Sahaj,

00:52:09.652 --> 00:52:17.636
how they are expressing their spiritual
strength.

00:52:18.926 --> 00:52:28.637
Now, we have many very good children and
also they are absolutely Sahaj.

00:52:28.990 --> 00:52:33.731
One boy came and he just prostrated himself
before me.

00:52:33.932 --> 00:52:35.554
So, I said, “Why you did it?”

00:52:35.755 --> 00:52:43.232
“I was getting cool vibrations, Mother,
from You, so I did it.”

00:52:43.433 --> 00:52:46.823
“Is it, you like it?”
“Of course!”

00:52:47.024 --> 00:52:50.502
“More than chocolate?”
“Of course!”

00:52:50.703 --> 00:52:54.104
I was surprised. “What... you eat them or
what?”

00:52:54.319 --> 00:52:58.873
“No, no need to eat, you know, you feel
so happy inside

00:52:59.074 --> 00:53:03.847
and I feel, Mother, You are putting Your
hand on my heart

00:53:04.048 --> 00:53:07.159
and trying to console me.”

00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:09.411
I was surprised. “And where is your heart?”

00:53:09.612 --> 00:53:13.746
He said, “It’s here, here is my heart,
I feel it here.”

00:53:13.947 --> 00:53:19.038
Just imagine, what love and what
understanding of Sahaja Yoga.

00:53:19.239 --> 00:53:24.487
For these little children who are below
even five years.

00:53:24.688 --> 00:53:27.650
Now, you are all grown up children of mine

00:53:27.851 --> 00:53:32.384
and I want you to know all the beauties
that are within you,

00:53:32.584 --> 00:53:36.494
that you have to enjoy. First of all, learn
to laugh at yourself.

00:53:36.695 --> 00:53:41.837
That’s the best way to enjoy yourself,
you know.

00:53:42.038 --> 00:53:49.474
And not to spend much time looking in
the mirror, that’s another way.

00:53:49.675 --> 00:53:52.860
You spend too much at the mirror, then
there’s something wrong with you.

00:53:53.061 --> 00:53:57.921
I think, personally, that it’s a kind of
a possession may be.

00:53:58.122 --> 00:54:04.251
So, what you should see inside: “Are we
Sahaj Dharmies?”

00:54:04.452 --> 00:54:07.001
Mother has established Sahaj Dharma,

00:54:07.202 --> 00:54:10.426
much more than what Krishna wanted
to establish.

00:54:10.627 --> 00:54:15.859
He wanted to establish the Dharma of love
which of course we have,

00:54:16.076 --> 00:54:21.119
but apart from that we have so many other
beautiful facets

00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:25.423
and such beautiful things within our
personality

00:54:25.623 --> 00:54:31.232
that we have forgotten to enjoy.

00:54:31.433 --> 00:54:38.065
So, the attention should be on your own
qualities, on your own personalities

00:54:38.266 --> 00:54:45.247
and then you’ll be amazed how your
personality is giving you joy,

00:54:45.448 --> 00:54:53.981
giving you Alladha, giving you so much
of patience with others.

00:54:54.706 --> 00:54:58.691
To Me the whole thing looks like sometimes
a joke

00:54:58.892 --> 00:55:03.402
because nothing so serious.

00:55:03.603 --> 00:55:07.327
It’s not a Rama’s type that you have
to be serious.

00:55:07.528 --> 00:55:15.474
I don’t have to kill anybody, I don’t use
any weapons in this lifetime.

00:55:15.803 --> 00:55:19.094
Without weapons if things are solved, what
can you do?

00:55:19.295 --> 00:55:22.502
But you must try to see the beauty
as Sahaja Yogis.

00:55:22.703 --> 00:55:27.387
You should be sensitive to see how you
have been helped,

00:55:27.588 --> 00:55:31.646
how you have been guided, how you have
been blessed.

00:55:31.846 --> 00:55:34.339
This is sahaj dharma.

00:55:34.540 --> 00:55:39.123
If you cannot know that, then you live
on a very low level.

00:55:39.324 --> 00:55:41.918
I mean, it’s not fault of Sahaja Yoga,

00:55:42.118 --> 00:55:46.143
but it’s your style, you are not sensitive.

00:55:46.970 --> 00:55:53.969
Supposing somebody does not know that he
is burning his hand.

00:55:54.862 --> 00:55:57.260
So what will you do?

00:55:57.460 --> 00:56:01.233
He has no sense, he has no sensitivity,
he cannot feel.

00:56:01.434 --> 00:56:05.167
He can drink, he can smoke, he can do
everything

00:56:05.368 --> 00:56:08.884
and still he Is existing, alright.

00:56:09.085 --> 00:56:13.930
Must be a rakshasa, I think or I don’t know
what to say.

00:56:14.131 --> 00:56:18.967
So, we have to take example from other good
Sahaja Yogis

00:56:19.168 --> 00:56:27.211
and not from the bad ones and how do we
proceed in enjoyment -

00:56:27.412 --> 00:56:30.615
which is a ocean, just an ocean.

00:56:30.816 --> 00:56:36.068
For example, now, I came, everybody was
trying to fan.

00:56:36.269 --> 00:56:38.370
But also in the West another problem is

00:56:38.571 --> 00:56:42.856
they like to live in hermetically sealed
rooms, hermetically sealed cars,

00:56:43.057 --> 00:56:47.043
they are very afraid of draught, I don’t
know, as if they’ll be thrown away

00:56:47.244 --> 00:56:50.658
or what will happen to them. They don’t
want draught.

00:56:50.859 --> 00:56:55.131
I mean draught is not coming from some
iceberg.

00:56:55.332 --> 00:56:59.484
So, they don’t believe in the fresh air
at all

00:56:59.685 --> 00:57:06.215
and that’s one other reason that people are
very suffocating sometimes, you know,

00:57:06.416 --> 00:57:10.402
they just suffocate. They are used
to a suffocating life.

00:57:10.603 --> 00:57:16.263
Once I was in India, I was very hot, so
somebody was driving me,

00:57:16.464 --> 00:57:21.204
but the person who was there was from
a Western country.

00:57:21.405 --> 00:57:24.100
He said, “Don’t open - don’t open
the window.”

00:57:24.301 --> 00:57:28.006
I said, “Why?” “There’s a draught.”
I said, “In this country, in India

00:57:28.207 --> 00:57:32.156
people live in the open. What is a draught?

00:57:32.357 --> 00:57:34.570
What draught you are talking about?”

00:57:34.771 --> 00:57:37.367
You can’t open the door, you can’t open
the window,

00:57:37.568 --> 00:57:40.592
you can’t open anything, if you open
anything,

00:57:40.792 --> 00:57:46.900
they’ll be all dead, you see as if.
So open yourself!

00:57:47.101 --> 00:57:52.761
As it is about the nature, also it is
in their private lives.

00:57:52.961 --> 00:57:55.912
They don’t want to open.

00:57:58.146 --> 00:58:00.345
If somebody comes to their house,
“Oh, my God,

00:58:00.546 --> 00:58:03.864
now we’ll have to share the wines,

00:58:04.065 --> 00:58:09.709
we’ll have to share the foods.” They cannot
share.

00:58:10.642 --> 00:58:17.523
They cannot share. That is most
uncollective.

00:58:19.621 --> 00:58:23.949
But in India, I must say, people have
a good sharing capacity

00:58:24.150 --> 00:58:30.253
because they are still primitive, they are
still primordial,

00:58:30.454 --> 00:58:38.887
yet not gone out of the way to satisfy
their own ego.

00:58:39.088 --> 00:58:45.208
But I think somehow or other in India,
people like to share.

00:58:53.291 --> 00:58:56.151
If you want to please any Indian, you tell
them,

00:58:56.352 --> 00:58:59.981
“tomorrow I’ll come and have food with
you.” His wife will jump.

00:59:00.182 --> 00:59:04.302
She’ll say, “Now what do you like, tell me,
what food do you like?”

00:59:04.502 --> 00:59:09.871
She will jump. But otherwise, what happens,

00:59:10.072 --> 00:59:13.249
as soon as you say he Is coming for food,
the wife will say,

00:59:13.450 --> 00:59:18.096
“No, no, I am going to my mother.”

00:59:20.008 --> 00:59:23.566
Immediately she’ll have a programme.

00:59:26.396 --> 00:59:29.807
I just don’t understand. They’ll have
beautiful houses,

00:59:30.008 --> 00:59:33.242
very clean, very beautiful everything,

00:59:33.443 --> 00:59:36.861
but if somebody comes to their house, they
get a shock

00:59:37.062 --> 00:59:44.250
as if electricity has entered. So, for whom
is all this?

00:59:45.469 --> 00:59:49.819
To show off, they will borrow money from
the banks.

00:59:50.020 --> 00:59:52.656
Even Indians in America they do.

00:59:52.857 --> 00:59:59.854
They want to have three Mercedes, four
houses, for what?

01:00:00.055 --> 01:00:03.428
Borrowing money, with borrowing money
they’ll do it.

01:00:03.629 --> 01:00:08.201
Sahaja Yogis have not to borrow any money.

01:00:09.722 --> 01:00:13.272
There is no need, you can do away with
things.

01:00:13.473 --> 01:00:16.299
Why to have so many cars?

01:00:16.499 --> 01:00:20.013
Nowadays, people don’t even walk at all.

01:00:20.214 --> 01:00:26.435
We used to go to our school, my father had
a car in India - nothing doing.

01:00:26.636 --> 01:00:29.520
We had to walk. We used to climb one
mountain.

01:00:29.721 --> 01:00:34.171
It was about five miles the school – every
morning.

01:00:34.377 --> 01:00:39.148
Then in the night, in the evening, the car
used to come, you see.

01:00:39.349 --> 01:00:42.638
And I would walk with my bare feet,

01:00:42.839 --> 01:00:46.499
because so much vibrations were there,
and the chappals,

01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:48.834
I thought were cutting my vibrations,

01:00:49.035 --> 01:00:53.751
so I used to have chappals in my hand and
walk.

01:00:53.952 --> 01:00:57.432
One day, we had a new driver, my father
sent him.

01:00:57.633 --> 01:01:00.135
He said, “How will I know who is
your daughter?”

01:01:00.336 --> 01:01:07.285
He said, “Any girl with the chappals in her
hand is the one whom you have to bring.”

01:01:07.486 --> 01:01:15.324
So, it is to enjoy your nobility, to enjoy
your generosity.

01:01:15.525 --> 01:01:20.470
It’s very important. And not to side
with anyone.

01:01:20.671 --> 01:01:24.040
You are not identified with anyone.

01:01:24.937 --> 01:01:29.499
It’s much better now, I think, because
since you have taken to Sahaj Dharma,

01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:33.290
I’ve seen - English will tell you what’s
wrong with English,

01:01:33.491 --> 01:01:36.018
Swiss will tell you what’s wrong with
Swiss,

01:01:36.219 --> 01:01:39.984
Indians will tell you what’s wrong with
Indians. Actually, I learnt from them.

01:01:40.185 --> 01:01:42.056
I don’t know these things are there.

01:01:42.256 --> 01:01:45.688
Russians will tell you what’s wrong with
Russians.

01:01:45.889 --> 01:01:50.019
They immediately start seeing, “What’s
wrong with us?

01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:53.477
Where do we lack in this?”

01:01:53.678 --> 01:02:01.099
Because the collectivity of being in one
country, say as an Indian,

01:02:01.572 --> 01:02:08.875
we see now, what’s happening in India,
all corrupt, horrible, this, that.

01:02:09.076 --> 01:02:11.565
So, I said, “Alright, if you don’t like
India, why don’t you go somewhere else?”

01:02:11.766 --> 01:02:14.596
“No, no, no, no, that - we will stay here,

01:02:14.797 --> 01:02:20.934
but this is a very corrupt government, they
are very bad, this, that.”

01:02:21.633 --> 01:02:26.032
Anywhere you go, you will find immediately
they see -

01:02:26.233 --> 01:02:34.512
because you don’t know they are now chosen
to change their country.

01:02:35.194 --> 01:02:39.699
I have taken up many questions now,
of India

01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:44.131
and I’m going to start working on that
level now.

01:02:44.332 --> 01:02:49.439
We have already started, in a way, for
the destitute women,

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:52.402
then for other type of poverty and all
that.

01:02:52.603 --> 01:02:56.574
Just by saying, remove poverty, poverty
cannot be lost.

01:02:56.775 --> 01:03:01.019
You have to have feeling for the poor,
then only.

01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:07.329
But you get with more that feeling because
you are an Indian.

01:03:07.538 --> 01:03:11.961
You are an Indian, so what? Your own
brothers, sisters starving.

01:03:12.162 --> 01:03:17.423
You get that very deep feeling within you
if you are a Sahaj Dharmi.

01:03:17.624 --> 01:03:21.701
So, this is the new Dharma we have
established now in this world.

01:03:21.901 --> 01:03:26.650
A new race, with a new Dharma, which is
much above

01:03:26.851 --> 01:03:31.045
even Shri Krishna’s vision is coming
through.

01:03:31.246 --> 01:03:36.676
He describes in the beginning. I think,
He was not a good salesman,

01:03:36.877 --> 01:03:39.200
because He describes the best first;

01:03:39.401 --> 01:03:43.336
you see, the salesman first will start from
two rupees,

01:03:43.537 --> 01:03:48.285
then go onward to two thousand rupies.
But He first told us

01:03:48.486 --> 01:03:52.543
that you have to become Sthita Pragnya,
means Sahaja Yogi -

01:03:52.743 --> 01:03:57.214
and then Shri Krishna was asked a question
by Arjuna,

01:03:57.415 --> 01:04:01.061
“What is a Sthita Pragya?” Then He
describes a Sahaja Yogi,

01:04:01.262 --> 01:04:05.454
that He describes before, first chapter,
second chapter is that.

01:04:05.655 --> 01:04:12.683
Now, then the questions start. You know,
Arjuna was a great questioner, I think.

01:04:12.884 --> 01:04:15.590
So, he starts asking questions, “Then what
about this

01:04:15.790 --> 01:04:18.199
and what about that and what about that?”

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:21.869
So He goes on explaining to him that,

01:04:22.070 --> 01:04:28.564
“You see, this is all just a Maya, this is
all an illusion you have.

01:04:28.765 --> 01:04:31.362
Get out of this illusion.

01:04:31.563 --> 01:04:35.391
If once you get out of this illusion,”
because Arjuna said,

01:04:35.592 --> 01:04:40.221
“They are my relations, they are my
teachers. How can I kill them?”

01:04:40.422 --> 01:04:42.994
So, Krishna says, “Nobody is killed.”

01:04:43.195 --> 01:04:46.173
He said, “Nobody is killed, but they are
being killed

01:04:46.374 --> 01:04:51.260
because they are not following the Satya
Dharma, so it’s alright.”

01:04:51.461 --> 01:04:53.564
What is your brother, what is your sister?

01:04:53.765 --> 01:04:56.051
They are not following the Satya Dharma,

01:04:56.257 --> 01:04:57.913
so you have nothing to do with them.

01:04:58.114 --> 01:05:02.219
If you can correct them and help them,
it’s alright, otherwise forget them.

01:05:02.419 --> 01:05:06.845
First, deal with people who are straight.

01:05:07.046 --> 01:05:12.754
Like we should say that we must deal with
people who are simple, innocent

01:05:12.955 --> 01:05:18.270
and then you can take to difficult people
when you are that good.

01:05:18.471 --> 01:05:20.379
Otherwise you will come here saying,
“Mother,

01:05:20.579 --> 01:05:22.622
I have caught this, I have caught that.”

01:05:22.823 --> 01:05:25.516
So, in Sahaj Dharma, you being the Spirit,

01:05:25.717 --> 01:05:31.855
you also know about others, very well
and you can make it out,

01:05:32.056 --> 01:05:35.224
who is who, what chakras they are catching.

01:05:35.425 --> 01:05:41.890
But the trouble in America, I found that
Sahaja Yogis used to,

01:05:42.091 --> 01:05:47.166
just could go and tell somebody, “You are
catching on this chakra.”

01:05:47.367 --> 01:05:49.438
Now, he has come for the first time and you
tell him,

01:05:49.639 --> 01:05:53.275
“You, you are very egoistical.” He says,
“How do you know?”

01:05:53.476 --> 01:05:57.215
“Your Agnya is catching.” Maybe, his own
Agnya might be catching.

01:05:57.416 --> 01:06:00.402
Is this the way to receive a new person?

01:06:00.603 --> 01:06:04.358
Is this the way to talk to a new person?

01:06:04.559 --> 01:06:07.249
See, on the contrary, you should say,
“Come, sit down,

01:06:07.449 --> 01:06:10.206
very nice, you are very great, see?”

01:06:10.407 --> 01:06:15.655
Because they are still ignorant, so they
like some sort of

01:06:15.856 --> 01:06:20.905
buttering, as you call it, you see, we call
it chaplusi. Then, gradually,

01:06:21.106 --> 01:06:26.145
because you are doing this just to make
him a Sahaja Yogi,

01:06:26.402 --> 01:06:29.042
because you love him. Basically that is
the reason.

01:06:29.242 --> 01:06:31.546
But as soon as somebody comes in,
if you tell him,

01:06:31.747 --> 01:06:35.441
“This is wrong with you, that’s wrong
with you.”

01:06:35.642 --> 01:06:39.886
This is not a Pope’s business,

01:06:40.086 --> 01:06:42.648
where you go on telling people what’s
wrong with them,

01:06:42.849 --> 01:06:45.346
go and confess. To whom?

01:06:45.547 --> 01:06:48.299
To all these silly people. It’s not that.

01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:53.208
What we have to show; that you have fallen
in love with that person,

01:06:53.409 --> 01:06:57.066
you are nice to that person because you
like that person.

01:06:57.267 --> 01:06:59.638
Then gradually you pull him up.

01:06:59.839 --> 01:07:03.685
But as soon as he comes you give him one
shot, so finished.

01:07:03.886 --> 01:07:07.047
How can you have good relations?

01:07:07.248 --> 01:07:08.554
Americans have to learn this.

01:07:08.755 --> 01:07:12.096
I don’t know why Americans think they are
very superior people.

01:07:12.297 --> 01:07:17.426
I tell you for wisdom I would not say they
are so much.

01:07:17.627 --> 01:07:20.517
It’s completely lacking – wisdom in them.

01:07:20.718 --> 01:07:25.085
And they misunderstand people very fast,

01:07:25.286 --> 01:07:29.757
start judging others, is not the way you
can have Sahaj Dharma.

01:07:29.958 --> 01:07:34.217
Sahaj Dharma is – you are your own. You
are in your own,

01:07:34.418 --> 01:07:37.428
you are in your own realm and in your
happiness and joy.

01:07:37.658 --> 01:07:41.595
Where is the time to criticise others?

01:07:42.118 --> 01:07:48.523
So the best thing is to show your maximum
love to everyone.

01:07:48.724 --> 01:07:51.590
In that love, you should not show your pity

01:07:51.791 --> 01:07:55.609
but love which is again: Alladha dayini.

01:07:55.810 --> 01:08:00.185
This is the message of Shri Krishna but
I don’t know how many understood it.

01:08:00.385 --> 01:08:06.562
Now, what you find those who are following
Shri Krishna, like Hare Rama people,

01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:09.827
they are really beggars on the street.

01:08:10.028 --> 01:08:14.676
He is Kubera, and his disciples are all
beggars, can you imagine.

01:08:14.877 --> 01:08:18.325
Does it add to His glory as Kubera?

01:08:18.526 --> 01:08:22.144
So, Sahaja Yogis are not like that.

01:08:22.505 --> 01:08:30.089
Should be generous, should not bother too
much about yourself.

01:08:30.290 --> 01:08:33.015
Should not all the time think about
yourself,

01:08:33.216 --> 01:08:38.657
but think of the collectivity, how you
behave.

01:08:41.196 --> 01:08:46.274
Collectivity is not to bring – force people
to come to Sahaja Yoga.

01:08:46.475 --> 01:08:50.246
Once they come to Sahaja Yoga they will
know the joy of life

01:08:50.447 --> 01:08:54.005
and you don’t have to tell them anything.
Nothing has to be told,

01:08:54.206 --> 01:08:59.864
just silently it will work and they will
feel your love.

01:09:00.284 --> 01:09:03.705
You see, love is something so great.

01:09:03.906 --> 01:09:09.771
It not only helps others but it also
helps you.

01:09:09.977 --> 01:09:13.439
It’s so joyous to give realisation to
others.

01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:16.079
But if you start telling, “Your this chakra
is catching”,

01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:17.689
why are you giving realisation?

01:09:17.890 --> 01:09:22.002
If you don’t know how to give realisation,
better not do it.

01:09:22.203 --> 01:09:28.368
So, to criticise is not the way we can
enjoy love.

01:09:28.569 --> 01:09:32.372
Ah, of course you can pull the legs of each
other sometimes,

01:09:32.573 --> 01:09:36.341
just for fun’s sake, but not to harm,

01:09:36.542 --> 01:09:43.003
not to torture, not to make that person
fall.

01:09:44.043 --> 01:09:48.928
You are all Sahaj Dharmies, you have
accepted Sahaj Dharma

01:09:49.129 --> 01:09:56.684
and in Sahaj Dharma we have to have
pure love of the heart,

01:09:56.885 --> 01:10:02.943
not hypocrisy, and a sensible life.

01:10:03.144 --> 01:10:07.974
Now, this Pope is against abortion.
I’m not.

01:10:09.069 --> 01:10:12.254
If a woman is suffering, let her have
abortion.

01:10:12.455 --> 01:10:17.365
The one who is living is more important
than the ones who are not living.

01:10:17.619 --> 01:10:23.541
If somebody wants to have abortion, that
child can be born again.

01:10:23.742 --> 01:10:28.559
According to us, nobody dies permanently,

01:10:29.679 --> 01:10:31.532
whatever it may be.

01:10:31.733 --> 01:10:40.936
So, this is one way they use it for
propagation of human beings.

01:10:41.137 --> 01:10:44.130
Like they say the Moslem women are
a like a factory.

01:10:44.331 --> 01:10:47.335
They go on producing more children, more
children, more children.

01:10:47.550 --> 01:10:51.603
So there are more voters.

01:10:51.804 --> 01:10:55.364
So the Pope knows that. That’s why he
says, “Abortion, No.”

01:10:55.565 --> 01:10:58.218
Christians should not abort, because
then there will be

01:10:58.419 --> 01:11:05.257
less Christians to compete with
the Moslems.

01:11:06.442 --> 01:11:11.920
But in Sahaja Yoga, we don’t have such
funny, radical, nonsensical things.

01:11:12.121 --> 01:11:17.528
We have divorce, and we have also abortion,

01:11:17.729 --> 01:11:26.135
which is important to understand that these
are all taboos which are there.

01:11:26.336 --> 01:11:33.285
But not for people who have to get out
of the troubles –

01:11:33.486 --> 01:11:38.282
you have to help them. Then that’s how
it works.

01:11:38.483 --> 01:11:41.539
But to be very frank, we don’t have to do
abortions,

01:11:41.739 --> 01:11:46.643
it is achieved by Paramchaitanya.

01:11:46.844 --> 01:11:50.710
Paramchaitanya does for me. I don’t have
to.

01:11:50.911 --> 01:11:54.219
I don’t have to do anything. It’s
Paramchaitanya.

01:11:54.420 --> 01:12:00.790
It’s nice because it knows what is to be
done, how to achieve it.

01:12:00.991 --> 01:12:03.689
And sometimes you are in trouble, then know

01:12:03.889 --> 01:12:07.485
that you are not leaving things into the
hands of the Paramchaitanya.

01:12:07.686 --> 01:12:09.624
If you leave it into the hands
of Paramchaitanya

01:12:09.824 --> 01:12:13.685
things will work out very well.

01:12:14.094 --> 01:12:17.244
So, to understand Sahaja Yoga, first and
foremost thing is,

01:12:17.444 --> 01:12:21.351
how much you are enjoying yourself?

01:12:21.552 --> 01:12:25.844
How much enjoyment are you giving
to others?

01:12:26.579 --> 01:12:29.803
For that you have music, you have this,
that.

01:12:30.004 --> 01:12:32.254
I was saying that today I won’t speak much,

01:12:32.455 --> 01:12:38.112
but, somehow, with Shri Krishna you can’t
keep quiet.

01:12:39.537 --> 01:12:49.394
He played Murli, Bansuri, flute. Look
at Him.

01:12:49.595 --> 01:12:54.933
I talked to you, but He just played Murli.

01:12:55.134 --> 01:13:00.742
He didn’t talk so much, except for
the Gita, you won’t find Him talking.

01:13:00.943 --> 01:13:05.339
And those who read also Gita are horrible
people, I tell you, I have met,

01:13:05.540 --> 01:13:10.149
those who read Gita. They don’t understand
what Shri Krishna’s Dharma is.

01:13:10.350 --> 01:13:14.709
If they don’t understand Shri Krishna, how
will they understand Sahaja Yoga?

01:13:14.910 --> 01:13:23.860
So, for all of you is to practice on love,

01:13:24.206 --> 01:13:32.943
on forgiveness, on appreciating others,
on giving joy to others.

01:13:33.144 --> 01:13:37.241
Some of the Sahaja Yogis have been very
kind to me also.

01:13:37.442 --> 01:13:41.103
Once I went to the shop to buy a sari,
for myself

01:13:41.304 --> 01:13:48.675
and the sari was very expensive for my
purpose. So, I didn’t buy.

01:13:48.876 --> 01:13:55.117
Said, “Let it be. This colour suits me,
alright, but it doesn’t matter.”

01:13:55.318 --> 01:13:58.099
I didn’t have so much money to buy that.

01:13:58.416 --> 01:14:01.489
So, that Sahaja Yogi bought that sari

01:14:01.690 --> 01:14:05.623
and on my birthday gave me – and really,
I could not see

01:14:05.824 --> 01:14:12.214
because my eyes were filled with tears.
Just a small thing like that.

01:14:12.625 --> 01:14:16.235
Normally I don’t expect you to do
anything for me, no.

01:14:16.436 --> 01:14:19.873
But small, small things make you so happy.

01:14:20.074 --> 01:14:22.878
But even if you do this to somebody, may
not understand,

01:14:23.079 --> 01:14:25.241
may not realize, may not feel it.

01:14:25.442 --> 01:14:29.592
But if you are a Sahaja Yogi, you will.

01:14:30.438 --> 01:14:36.582
So thank you very much; for all this that
I have said to you,

01:14:36.783 --> 01:14:41.738
try to enjoy yourself and make others
enjoy you.

01:14:41.939 --> 01:14:44.122
May God bless you.
