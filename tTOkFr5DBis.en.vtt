00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.610
Today we have assembled here

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.819
to worship Sadashiva,

00:02:51.111 --> 00:02:57.402
which is reflected within us as Shiva, as the spirit.

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.735
He is reflected in our heart,

00:03:06.735 --> 00:03:12.485
and as you have seen

00:03:13.944 --> 00:03:20.235
that the goal of our life

00:03:21.861 --> 00:03:27.861
was to achieve this state of spirit.

00:03:32.861 --> 00:03:36.652
The other day I was reading some books

00:03:38.402 --> 00:03:43.485
how it was done,

00:03:47.652 --> 00:03:52.193
this Self-realization, to know the spirit,

00:03:52.902 --> 00:03:57.652
and how people were tortured.

00:03:59.151 --> 00:04:04.569
First of all they're asked to

00:04:06.902 --> 00:04:12.735
somehow or other deny, defy and condemn their body.

00:04:15.277 --> 00:04:19.902
Now, if the body wants to have comfort,

00:04:21.151 --> 00:04:29.694
then it was said that first try to sleep on the carpet,

00:04:30.111 --> 00:04:32.861
not on the bed.

00:04:33.986 --> 00:04:37.777
Then still, it's not enough;

00:04:38.277 --> 00:04:41.277
then from the carpet you go to a mat

00:04:42.652 --> 00:04:44.443
still is not enough.

00:04:44.777 --> 00:04:48.111
Then from that maybe,

00:04:49.527 --> 00:04:52.193
you move down

00:04:53.235 --> 00:04:57.069
to the Mother Earth,

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.485
sleep on the Mother Earth.

00:05:00.318 --> 00:05:04.193
Still if the body is not all right

00:05:04.443 --> 00:05:08.777
then you start sleeping on the stone.

00:05:09.318 --> 00:05:13.027
But still the Himalayas are far away,

00:05:13.777 --> 00:05:16.235
because Shiva resides in Kailasha.

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:21.235
So you go to Himalayas and sleep on the ice.

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:26.069
This was the minimum requirement.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:34.777
Then it was said that you are fond of good food,

00:05:37.027 --> 00:05:39.443
you want to have sumptuous food,

00:05:39.777 --> 00:05:42.694
you eat a lot, all right;

00:05:43.318 --> 00:05:46.819
so you deny everything that you like, to begin with,

00:05:47.151 --> 00:05:48.944
all that you like.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.610
For example, Italians cannot eat pasta!

00:05:58.235 --> 00:06:02.819
Then deny that.

00:06:04.443 --> 00:06:06.986
But that's not sufficient.

00:06:07.443 --> 00:06:10.694
After that you start eating things

00:06:11.402 --> 00:06:13.443
which are very bitter.

00:06:13.777 --> 00:06:17.193
As in the Zen system they give you to eat

00:06:17.527 --> 00:06:21.235
something which is like quinine raised to power 108,

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:26.360
absolutely bitter - or absolutely sweet.

00:06:26.694 --> 00:06:30.111
So put your tongue into test.

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:34.402
But still the stomach is there.

00:06:34.694 --> 00:06:37.402
So if you are eating too much,

00:06:37.694 --> 00:06:41.318
you fast for one day. That's not sufficient.

00:06:41.694 --> 00:06:43.652
Then fast for seven days.

00:06:43.986 --> 00:06:45.777
Then for forty days.

00:06:46.151 --> 00:06:50.527
I mean, a month has got only thirty days;

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:53.777
to fast for forty days means you are already finished.

00:06:54.111 --> 00:06:58.986
That's how if you have to do your penance for nirvana.

00:06:59.235 --> 00:07:00.694
As it is you get a nirvana

00:07:01.027 --> 00:07:03.193
because you're finished and dead, you see,

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:07.986
nothing is left out of you, nothing but bones,

00:07:08.235 --> 00:07:12.151
and these bones then become nirvana.

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:14.485
Ultimately the death follows,

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:16.235
so you are finished and there is nirvana,

00:07:16.485 --> 00:07:18.819
no doubt about it.

00:07:20.986 --> 00:07:23.111
Then you don't live in a house,

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:25.193
because house is comfort.

00:07:25.527 --> 00:07:28.902
Give up your wife, give up your children, give up everyone.

00:07:31.111 --> 00:07:34.318
Now wear only one something,

00:07:35.569 --> 00:07:38.027
like a cloth tied round,

00:07:41.443 --> 00:07:48.069
and go and ask for alms from people.

00:07:54.235 --> 00:07:58.069
With these clothes also there's still problem,

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.819
because you're attached to your cloth.

00:08:01.235 --> 00:08:04.443
So you go to Himalayas where there's nobody to see you,

00:08:04.819 --> 00:08:05.944
take out your clothes

00:08:06.193 --> 00:08:10.360
and in that cold you stay there, completely shaking.

00:08:10.944 --> 00:08:12.485
Then you'll get your nirvana.

00:08:12.819 --> 00:08:15.652
As it is you get nirvana.

00:08:18.819 --> 00:08:22.027
All such conditions were put

00:08:25.193 --> 00:08:30.569
as to destroy the demands of your body to begin with.

00:08:32.902 --> 00:08:34.569
You tell your body, "No, nothing doing.

00:08:34.986 --> 00:08:39.819
You better work out your nirvana."

00:08:40.986 --> 00:08:45.902
The second thing was to destroy your mind

00:08:48.193 --> 00:08:51.235
which takes you to senses,

00:08:51.652 --> 00:08:54.694
to things of joy.

00:08:55.235 --> 00:08:59.360
Supposing you want to have some,

00:09:03.027 --> 00:09:05.318
something very much,

00:09:05.777 --> 00:09:09.902
so deny that, deny that.

00:09:10.527 --> 00:09:12.443
Anything that your mind tells you,

00:09:12.777 --> 00:09:15.527
just say "No, no, no" to it.

00:09:16.193 --> 00:09:18.777
In Sanskrit

00:09:20.861 --> 00:09:22.861
the shloka is like this,

00:09:23.152 --> 00:09:25.569
"Yat neti neti vachane, nigamo vacha"

00:09:25.861 --> 00:09:26.944
- which you go on saying,

00:09:27.235 --> 00:09:31.152
"neti, neti": "No, not this, not this, not this, not this."

00:09:31.777 --> 00:09:34.694
And then you can discuss about

00:09:35.027 --> 00:09:37.861
- discuss only, yes - nirvana.

00:09:38.277 --> 00:09:43.652
Before that you are not even worthy of discussion of nirvana.

00:09:45.861 --> 00:09:47.277
When I read this book I said,

00:09:47.527 --> 00:09:50.861
"Baba, I give up. It's too much."

00:09:55.152 --> 00:09:58.069
But in Sahaja Yoga

00:09:59.652 --> 00:10:01.193
is the other way round,

00:10:01.485 --> 00:10:04.318
like building first the pinnacle of the building,

00:10:04.652 --> 00:10:07.318
and then the foundation.

00:10:08.193 --> 00:10:12.527
Opening your Sahasrara was the first thing was achieved.

00:10:13.277 --> 00:10:16.402
And then in the light of Sahasrara

00:10:16.986 --> 00:10:20.152
you have to watch yourself and see for yourself.

00:10:21.318 --> 00:10:26.111
Gradually the introspection was a better thing,

00:10:27.193 --> 00:10:29.861
through vibrations

00:10:31.193 --> 00:10:34.527
is to see why:

00:10:34.777 --> 00:10:36.986
why I want this?

00:10:37.318 --> 00:10:40.277
Why my attention goes to my comfort?

00:10:40.777 --> 00:10:43.151
Why my attention goes to food,

00:10:43.527 --> 00:10:46.652
why to my family, why to my children,

00:10:47.027 --> 00:10:50.277
when I have to achieve the highest?

00:10:50.777 --> 00:10:53.527
So you start introspecting yourself.

00:10:54.027 --> 00:10:57.111
Then you know on your vibrations also

00:10:57.402 --> 00:11:00.111
there's something wrong with you.

00:11:00.861 --> 00:11:03.777
Then you don't try to see others,

00:11:04.027 --> 00:11:07.151
what's wrong with others, you start seeing yourself;

00:11:07.443 --> 00:11:13.151
because it's your own ascent

00:11:13.861 --> 00:11:16.527
you have to achieve.

00:11:19.443 --> 00:11:22.193
But in the olden times,

00:11:23.193 --> 00:11:28.193
all these things were done individually.

00:11:29.443 --> 00:11:32.694
Like a one person who starts

00:11:33.193 --> 00:11:36.235
the path of nirvana,

00:11:40.111 --> 00:11:45.152
he used to go into ekant, means into lonely places,

00:11:45.735 --> 00:11:47.902
stay away from people, avoid them,

00:11:48.193 --> 00:11:49.652
have nothing to do,

00:11:49.986 --> 00:11:53.902
and achieve this ascent,

00:11:54.861 --> 00:11:58.193
Self-realization, only for himself.

00:12:00.402 --> 00:12:02.986
It was not for others.

00:12:03.527 --> 00:12:07.193
Then this gentleman became absolutely exclusive.

00:12:07.777 --> 00:12:09.193
He wouldn't talk to anyone,

00:12:09.443 --> 00:12:11.527
he wouldn't meet anybody

00:12:12.027 --> 00:12:13.360
and he would sit somewhere

00:12:13.735 --> 00:12:18.235
on top of a remote mountain.

00:12:20.069 --> 00:12:22.069
Anybody who tried to meet him

00:12:22.277 --> 00:12:25.569
he would throw stones or say all kinds of horrible things,

00:12:25.861 --> 00:12:28.569
and never meet that person.

00:12:32.402 --> 00:12:36.610
But Sahaja Yoga is not the same thing.

00:12:37.902 --> 00:12:41.235
Sahaja Yoga is the ascent of the whole.

00:12:44.569 --> 00:12:47.485
This kind of singular achievements

00:12:47.819 --> 00:12:50.485
did not lead people anywhere.

00:12:51.402 --> 00:12:55.360
Saints of course tried to talk to people,

00:12:55.735 --> 00:12:58.152
tell them about Self-realization, about God,

00:12:58.569 --> 00:13:02.360
about righteousness, about value system;

00:13:02.944 --> 00:13:07.902
but they too were regarded as something strange,

00:13:08.735 --> 00:13:12.069
and were tortured and troubled.

00:13:14.277 --> 00:13:20.027
So on the level of an individual ascent,

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:22.735
they couldn't do anything for others

00:13:23.069 --> 00:13:25.819
except for talking about it, telling about it,

00:13:26.151 --> 00:13:30.485
till Sahaja Yoga came.

00:13:31.069 --> 00:13:34.819
Even the talking about it was prohibited.

00:13:36.235 --> 00:13:40.485
Till the twelfth century in India

00:13:40.902 --> 00:13:44.360
nobody talked about it to the public.

00:13:46.027 --> 00:13:47.819
It was all in Sanskrit,

00:13:48.151 --> 00:13:50.944
very difficult Sanskrit books

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:54.235
which were only available to few aspirants.

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:57.569
Was explained to very, very few even,

00:13:58.277 --> 00:14:02.694
amounting to few numbers of people.

00:14:05.027 --> 00:14:09.944
But giving realization was denied.

00:14:11.235 --> 00:14:15.027
So only one master had one disciple,

00:14:15.902 --> 00:14:18.610
and all was the individual ascent,

00:14:18.944 --> 00:14:20.735
individual working out.

00:14:21.069 --> 00:14:23.360
Such a disciple was taken away from others

00:14:23.694 --> 00:14:25.902
and was kept in secret,

00:14:26.277 --> 00:14:28.193
worked it out on him;

00:14:28.318 --> 00:14:32.944
and just he may sing, he may write poems,

00:14:33.235 --> 00:14:35.944
he may talk about it, he might say what his joy is,

00:14:36.318 --> 00:14:40.151
but he had no right to give realization to anyone,

00:14:40.485 --> 00:14:43.193
neither he knew how to give realization.

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:48.485
So now you see how far you have gone.

00:14:49.027 --> 00:14:51.485
You've got your realization

00:14:52.027 --> 00:14:54.694
without giving up much.

00:14:56.485 --> 00:14:59.944
You can work on a much wider scale,

00:15:00.443 --> 00:15:02.819
you can give realizations to other.

00:15:03.151 --> 00:15:06.694
You know about all the subtle knowledge

00:15:07.027 --> 00:15:10.902
about Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:13.443 --> 00:15:15.569
But today I'm going to tell you something more

00:15:15.986 --> 00:15:18.277
which we have to know.

00:15:20.193 --> 00:15:22.694
It's very important to know,

00:15:23.151 --> 00:15:27.861
because as was described by people

00:15:29.151 --> 00:15:33.861
that they practice Sahaja Yoga as they go to church,

00:15:35.402 --> 00:15:38.986
but it's not from their heart.

00:15:41.902 --> 00:15:45.111
And heart is the abode of the spirit

00:15:47.443 --> 00:15:51.277
- is the Shiva within us.

00:15:53.027 --> 00:15:55.902
So we have to know more about heart,

00:15:56.527 --> 00:16:00.277
and that is very important.

00:16:01.735 --> 00:16:04.610
You know about these three nadis we have:

00:16:05.069 --> 00:16:06.861
Ida, Pingala, Sushumna;

00:16:07.819 --> 00:16:10.944
but in the heart there are four nadis.

00:16:14.777 --> 00:16:19.111
And the one nadi goes to Mooladhara,

00:16:22.318 --> 00:16:26.360
and if you cross the limits of Mooladhara it goes to hell.

00:16:26.694 --> 00:16:31.027
That's why they say that Shiva is a destroyer.

00:16:31.485 --> 00:16:35.193
Actually you ask for your destruction.

00:16:37.193 --> 00:16:42.151
And when you ask for your destruction, you have it.

00:16:46.819 --> 00:16:50.694
Even if it destroys everything, as I was telling,

00:16:51.318 --> 00:16:55.443
it's like when a fruit has to come,

00:16:55.861 --> 00:16:59.443
the petals look as if they're destroyed

00:16:59.777 --> 00:17:02.443
- as I have destroyed, I would say, many of your things:

00:17:02.861 --> 00:17:05.402
you can call it like your conditionings,

00:17:05.694 --> 00:17:07.986
your ego, your racialism, your fanaticism.

00:17:08.402 --> 00:17:11.443
All this has been destroyed in Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:11.902 --> 00:17:14.527
This has to be destroyed

00:17:15.027 --> 00:17:18.151
for the beauty to come out.

00:17:19.318 --> 00:17:25.443
So when your maryadas

00:17:25.902 --> 00:17:30.527
you cross beyond certain point,

00:17:31.402 --> 00:17:34.610
you go to your destruction.

00:17:37.652 --> 00:17:41.443
In four directions there are destructions built,

00:17:41.902 --> 00:17:44.777
as there are four nadis.

00:17:46.402 --> 00:17:49.069
So now, what is to be done?

00:17:50.111 --> 00:17:54.111
How are we to stop this destruction of the,

00:17:54.527 --> 00:17:57.861
through the first nadi, going to hell?

00:17:59.402 --> 00:18:03.861
One of the qualities of Shiva is that He's innocence.

00:18:04.777 --> 00:18:07.861
He's extremely innocent. He's innocent like a child.

00:18:08.193 --> 00:18:11.277
He is innocence personified.

00:18:14.318 --> 00:18:17.485
So

00:18:19.235 --> 00:18:25.819
we have to put our carnal desires,

00:18:26.902 --> 00:18:29.777
dissolve them,

00:18:31.485 --> 00:18:36.318
dissolve them into the innocence,

00:18:36.694 --> 00:18:39.944
the ocean of innocence.

00:18:42.652 --> 00:18:47.235
You have to dissolve it in the ocean of innocence.

00:18:49.485 --> 00:18:55.235
Innocence is something to be appreciated,

00:18:55.569 --> 00:18:59.777
to be understood, to be enjoyed.

00:19:00.193 --> 00:19:03.902
Like you see animals, they're innocent;

00:19:04.902 --> 00:19:09.652
you see children, they're innocent;

00:19:10.443 --> 00:19:12.652
flowers, they're innocent.

00:19:14.027 --> 00:19:17.944
Divert your attention

00:19:20.027 --> 00:19:22.777
to all these things.

00:19:27.152 --> 00:19:30.610
You see, on walking on the street,

00:19:31.193 --> 00:19:34.111
what is there to see best

00:19:34.443 --> 00:19:38.193
is all at three feet height.

00:19:39.652 --> 00:19:43.111
You see at three feet height all the flowers,

00:19:43.443 --> 00:19:45.443
all the beautiful grass,

00:19:45.861 --> 00:19:50.151
all the children who are about three feet are the best.

00:19:51.151 --> 00:19:54.777
You need not see people who are above that.

00:19:57.694 --> 00:20:01.402
Just see on three feet level.

00:20:04.902 --> 00:20:09.902
You can see the legs of somebody, that's all right.

00:20:11.569 --> 00:20:14.777
But you don't see the eyes of a person

00:20:15.151 --> 00:20:18.027
who are not innocent.

00:20:18.944 --> 00:20:22.485
So dissolve this desire

00:20:24.069 --> 00:20:26.652
into innocence.

00:20:28.069 --> 00:20:31.277
And this Mooladhara which is innocent

00:20:33.152 --> 00:20:36.861
is not dead, finished, but is innocent,

00:20:38.193 --> 00:20:40.318
it is righteous,

00:20:40.735 --> 00:20:43.402
it is Shri Ganesha's qualities,

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:47.735
it's pure.

00:20:48.111 --> 00:20:50.277
So even if you are in this world,

00:20:50.527 --> 00:20:52.944
even if you are living like a human being,

00:20:53.318 --> 00:20:55.735
even if you have children,

00:20:56.527 --> 00:20:59.610
still you are innocent.

00:21:01.527 --> 00:21:06.735
Like once the wives of Shri Krishna

00:21:07.111 --> 00:21:10.069
- He had sixteen thousand wives to begin with,

00:21:10.402 --> 00:21:12.360
and the five more.

00:21:12.777 --> 00:21:14.485
The sixteen thousand were His powers,

00:21:14.819 --> 00:21:17.652
and five were the elements.

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:26.111
They were wanting to go to pray to some big well-known,

00:21:28.151 --> 00:21:32.652
I should say, saint had come, a maharshi had come.

00:21:33.027 --> 00:21:36.569
So they wanted to go and see him and pay respects.

00:21:37.193 --> 00:21:40.569
So they asked Shri Krishna's permission,

00:21:40.944 --> 00:21:45.151
but when they went they found the river was all in spate,

00:21:45.902 --> 00:21:49.652
so flooded they could not cross over.

00:21:50.402 --> 00:21:51.986
They came back, they said,

00:21:52.277 --> 00:21:57.235
"How can we cross over this river? It's all in spate."

00:21:58.152 --> 00:21:59.485
So this Krishna said,

00:21:59.819 --> 00:22:01.610
"All right, you just go and say,

00:22:02.151 --> 00:22:06.360
РІР‚В˜If Shri Krishna is Yogeshwara,

00:22:07.111 --> 00:22:12.193
and if He is absolutely innocent about sex,

00:22:13.652 --> 00:22:15.944
you go down.'"

00:22:19.069 --> 00:22:20.777
They said, "How can we? We are so many wives.

00:22:21.111 --> 00:22:23.360
What is He talking about?"

00:22:24.819 --> 00:22:27.527
So they went down and said this to the river,

00:22:27.986 --> 00:22:30.652
and the river went down, and they were surprised that

00:22:31.069 --> 00:22:35.277
"this husband of ours is saying all these things."

00:22:39.235 --> 00:22:44.111
They went across and worshipped that rishi

00:22:45.151 --> 00:22:49.111
and they were coming back, again the river was in floods.

00:22:51.069 --> 00:22:52.819
So they went back to the rishi, said,

00:22:53.111 --> 00:22:55.527
"Now how are we to cross over because it's in floods?"

00:22:55.986 --> 00:22:57.111
He said, "How did you come?"

00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:00.277
So they told the story of Shri Krishna.

00:23:00.944 --> 00:23:03.819
Now they had fed this rishi with food and fruits

00:23:04.151 --> 00:23:06.944
and he had eaten such a lot.

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:10.735
"All right, you go and tell this river that

00:23:11.069 --> 00:23:14.151
this rishi has not eaten at all anything."

00:23:14.569 --> 00:23:16.694
They said, "How can it be? Just now you ate before us."

00:23:17.111 --> 00:23:18.569
He said, "Just go and see."

00:23:18.902 --> 00:23:24.527
They went back and told this to the river.

00:23:26.443 --> 00:23:29.652
The river again went down.

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.902
So to live in this world,

00:23:35.527 --> 00:23:37.902
to be a wife or to be a husband,

00:23:38.235 --> 00:23:43.360
to be married, whatever it is,

00:23:45.193 --> 00:23:47.986
you can be innocent,

00:23:48.569 --> 00:23:51.819
absolutely innocent about it.

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:55.527
That's the sign of your purity.

00:23:58.819 --> 00:24:03.819
The second nadi, the second channel

00:24:04.235 --> 00:24:07.694
that can take you to destruction is desire.

00:24:08.777 --> 00:24:11.318
That's why Buddha has said that desirelessness

00:24:11.819 --> 00:24:15.443
is the only way that people do not get old,

00:24:15.819 --> 00:24:18.151
nor sick,

00:24:19.193 --> 00:24:22.027
nor worried.

00:24:25.777 --> 00:24:29.318
Now this desire that we have,

00:24:30.318 --> 00:24:32.111
"I want this,"

00:24:32.318 --> 00:24:35.652
in the West is much more than anywhere else

00:24:36.027 --> 00:24:38.151
because the entrepreneurs are every day

00:24:38.443 --> 00:24:40.694
producing new things.

00:24:41.111 --> 00:24:44.777
Say for example a hairdress,

00:24:45.151 --> 00:24:47.694
so the women want to buy this wig or that wig,

00:24:47.986 --> 00:24:51.193
"It's my desire, I must have this wig to put on my head."

00:24:51.652 --> 00:24:55.569
The another one says, "All right, I must have this one."

00:24:57.569 --> 00:25:03.652
And the desire, for men, is "Oh, if he is having

00:25:04.027 --> 00:25:07.527
a Rolls Royce, why shouldn't I have one?"

00:25:10.318 --> 00:25:13.777
They cannot enjoy somebody else's Rolls Royce.

00:25:15.694 --> 00:25:20.861
It should be your own, that "I should have the possession."

00:25:22.443 --> 00:25:26.777
Desires can be of any kind, not only material.

00:25:27.235 --> 00:25:32.360
The desires could be also

00:25:32.819 --> 00:25:35.027
quite mental,

00:25:37.069 --> 00:25:39.902
"I must possess this woman,

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:43.235
I must possess this child."

00:25:43.902 --> 00:25:48.569
All kinds of possessions that work into you as desires.

00:25:49.819 --> 00:25:53.360
But I wouldn't say it is because of attachment.

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:59.819
It's not attachment, but it is just to have more.

00:26:06.318 --> 00:26:13.027
Go on adding up things, getting things

00:26:16.694 --> 00:26:20.819
- still one doesn't feel happy and satisfied.

00:26:23.069 --> 00:26:25.360
What is the reason

00:26:26.694 --> 00:26:30.986
for this kind of a desire is that it's not pure desire.

00:26:31.861 --> 00:26:34.485
It's an impure desire.

00:26:35.152 --> 00:26:36.694
It's an impure desire,

00:26:36.944 --> 00:26:39.152
and when such a desire starts working

00:26:39.485 --> 00:26:41.485
you can go any far,

00:26:41.861 --> 00:26:44.277
like Saddam Hussein, like Hitler,

00:26:44.527 --> 00:26:46.111
like anything is nothing

00:26:46.402 --> 00:26:50.944
but absolutely desire beyond

00:26:52.986 --> 00:26:55.861
any limitations.

00:26:56.735 --> 00:26:59.360
You want to dominate others

00:27:01.111 --> 00:27:03.735
is also another desire.

00:27:06.277 --> 00:27:08.402
All these desires

00:27:09.527 --> 00:27:13.277
lead you ultimately to a destruction,

00:27:15.485 --> 00:27:17.694
because there's no joy,

00:27:18.152 --> 00:27:20.235
there's no happiness.

00:27:22.277 --> 00:27:28.402
For example, now I want to have a sari,

00:27:31.861 --> 00:27:34.527
so I want to buy a sari.

00:27:35.861 --> 00:27:38.402
All my attention will be how will I get that sari,

00:27:38.735 --> 00:27:40.861
I must get that sari, this thing, that thing.

00:27:41.152 --> 00:27:45.944
The attention becomes polluted,

00:27:46.402 --> 00:27:50.527
disturbed, for a nonsensical thing like a sari.

00:27:50.944 --> 00:27:54.944
The attention which has to enjoy,

00:27:56.277 --> 00:27:59.610
which has to enjoy the spirit,

00:28:01.235 --> 00:28:03.819
which has to nourish the spirit,

00:28:04.152 --> 00:28:10.111
becomes disturbed because of desires.

00:28:11.986 --> 00:28:15.152
In the first place the attention

00:28:15.485 --> 00:28:19.360
is disturbed because we are not innocent.

00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:24.485
In the second place the attention

00:28:25.402 --> 00:28:29.694
gets into turmoil because we have desire.

00:28:34.527 --> 00:28:39.735
So what should we do as far as the desire is concerned?

00:28:43.694 --> 00:28:46.485
The desire for beautiful things

00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:52.527
- we can shift our desire,

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:56.152
material desire into aesthetics,

00:28:56.610 --> 00:29:01.111
and have one thing but which is really aesthetically rich;

00:29:02.944 --> 00:29:05.819
because that's the quality of Shiva,

00:29:06.111 --> 00:29:09.819
that He gives aesthetics to everything.

00:29:10.152 --> 00:29:12.402
Now supposing this looks very plain,

00:29:12.694 --> 00:29:16.069
simple and one may say that mechanical.

00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:18.819
But if it was Shiva's job

00:29:19.111 --> 00:29:22.402
He would have done something beautiful about it.

00:29:24.111 --> 00:29:28.819
So the quality of Shiva is that He beautifies everything

00:29:29.485 --> 00:29:33.069
that is created by Brahmadeva,

00:29:33.902 --> 00:29:37.069
evolved by Vishnu.

00:29:37.652 --> 00:29:40.694
He's the one who does

00:29:41.027 --> 00:29:44.069
the subtle work of creating aesthetics.

00:29:44.527 --> 00:29:46.569
You've seen My photographs many a times

00:29:46.902 --> 00:29:51.111
with so many lights, this, that - is all His job.

00:29:51.443 --> 00:29:52.819
He's doing it.

00:29:53.151 --> 00:29:55.819
He throws lights in such a manner,

00:29:56.402 --> 00:29:58.694
He works out in such a manner.

00:29:59.111 --> 00:30:01.861
Just He wants to convince you about Me.

00:30:02.402 --> 00:30:03.694
It's His job.

00:30:03.986 --> 00:30:07.694
So His job is to create aesthetics:

00:30:09.569 --> 00:30:12.193
aesthetics of behavior,

00:30:13.069 --> 00:30:17.069
aesthetics of poetry.

00:30:19.902 --> 00:30:24.318
Everything that is created is made beautiful,

00:30:25.151 --> 00:30:29.569
is joy-giving, by Shiva - that's His quality.

00:30:32.485 --> 00:30:34.318
So whatever you desire,

00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:38.027
if you start working it out,

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:46.360
desiring for something aesthetically handmade, nice thing,

00:30:50.777 --> 00:30:52.944
gradually you'll find

00:30:53.318 --> 00:30:55.694
you'll end up with vibrations,

00:30:56.193 --> 00:30:59.652
because all beautiful things have vibrations.

00:31:01.944 --> 00:31:03.485
And to have the vibrations

00:31:03.819 --> 00:31:06.944
you'll have to go to pure desire.

00:31:08.569 --> 00:31:11.360
So this desire which is madness,

00:31:11.777 --> 00:31:14.027
which makes you mad,

00:31:14.443 --> 00:31:20.027
which is so much dull and boring

00:31:21.443 --> 00:31:25.902
becomes pure desire, because you have to dissolve

00:31:26.277 --> 00:31:28.443
all your desires into vibration.

00:31:28.694 --> 00:31:32.652
You start desiring nothing but vibrations after some time.

00:31:34.861 --> 00:31:37.861
You'll not buy anything which has no vibrations.

00:31:38.318 --> 00:31:41.443
You'll not talk to a person who has no vibrations.

00:31:42.193 --> 00:31:45.777
If somebody has [no] vibrations you'll just run away.

00:31:52.027 --> 00:31:55.069
I've seen people running away

00:31:55.402 --> 00:31:57.152
from some people

00:31:57.443 --> 00:32:01.610
as if some monkey is after them.

00:32:01.902 --> 00:32:03.027
When I look around,

00:32:03.318 --> 00:32:04.902
I find there are people who are drunkard,

00:32:05.152 --> 00:32:07.402
or somebody coming or something.

00:32:07.861 --> 00:32:11.027
They might have been drunkard themselves once upon a time,

00:32:11.527 --> 00:32:12.735
but now they run away,

00:32:13.069 --> 00:32:17.111
"No, no, no, no. Not so now. Now no, no more."

00:32:19.193 --> 00:32:21.610
We had three, four hippies to begin

00:32:21.986 --> 00:32:24.069
with who came with Me to India.

00:32:24.318 --> 00:32:26.193
They're normal like you, they were become,

00:32:26.527 --> 00:32:28.151
you see, Sahaja yogis.

00:32:28.443 --> 00:32:32.360
And four, five hippies came to My program,

00:32:32.694 --> 00:32:34.652
it was in Rahuri, I think.

00:32:35.027 --> 00:32:39.318
They got a fright of their life, "Oh no, oh, God!"

00:32:39.569 --> 00:32:41.027
I said, "What's the matter with you?

00:32:41.235 --> 00:32:42.944
Why are you so frightened?"

00:32:43.235 --> 00:32:45.193
So I turned round to see these hippies,

00:32:45.485 --> 00:32:48.443
and by the time I'd turned round they were out.

00:32:49.569 --> 00:32:52.069
They were no more there.

00:32:53.902 --> 00:32:58.777
So then what happens, all desire ends up into chaitanya,

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:01.485
into vibrations.

00:33:01.777 --> 00:33:02.861
And if it does not,

00:33:03.152 --> 00:33:05.318
then you must know there's something still missing.

00:33:05.652 --> 00:33:08.610
But if you do not do this,

00:33:09.777 --> 00:33:13.111
then you end up into your destruction.

00:33:14.318 --> 00:33:17.944
So to say that He's a destroyer

00:33:18.277 --> 00:33:22.652
is a very one-sided statement.

00:33:24.861 --> 00:33:27.152
He has both the powers.

00:33:27.610 --> 00:33:31.360
He has the power to give you vibrations.

00:33:32.111 --> 00:33:34.944
He gives you vibrations.

00:33:39.152 --> 00:33:43.277
The Goddess is the power, Shakti,

00:33:44.152 --> 00:33:46.069
but He makes the vibrations.

00:33:46.277 --> 00:33:49.193
It's like these are the fingers, all right,

00:33:50.111 --> 00:33:54.193
but if they tickle you then it's Shiva.

00:33:57.610 --> 00:34:00.069
The fingers are that of the Goddess, all right,

00:34:00.318 --> 00:34:04.152
but if it tickles, you know, gives you joy,

00:34:04.527 --> 00:34:09.111
happiness, it's Shiva, is the bhakti.

00:34:10.402 --> 00:34:14.152
The joy of bhakti comes from Shiva.

00:34:16.277 --> 00:34:18.944
Today only I was explaining

00:34:19.277 --> 00:34:22.402
how one lady who was a Devi bhakt

00:34:22.944 --> 00:34:25.569
and has done so much study of bhakti

00:34:25.902 --> 00:34:27.902
and all that and knew so much,

00:34:28.152 --> 00:34:32.360
just merged into Me.

00:34:32.402 --> 00:34:35.277
I just couldn't understand her how, what she has done,

00:34:35.777 --> 00:34:37.402
because normally people don't do.

00:34:37.652 --> 00:34:39.527
When they are reading about Devi they think,

00:34:39.777 --> 00:34:41.318
"All right, this is Devi, this is Mataji."

00:34:41.569 --> 00:34:43.443
You see, it's separate things.

00:34:43.694 --> 00:34:46.902
They don't know they are reading about Devi.

00:34:48.443 --> 00:34:50.777
So she said, "Mother, I just identified.

00:34:51.111 --> 00:34:54.027
It's written that how You are gentle,

00:34:54.402 --> 00:34:57.027
the Goddess is gentle, how She touches me,

00:34:57.402 --> 00:34:59.111
how She looks after me,

00:34:59.402 --> 00:35:01.777
how Her attention is on me."

00:35:02.193 --> 00:35:05.902
Like there's a sentence "kataksha, kataksha, nirikshana:

00:35:06.151 --> 00:35:08.527
every glance is an inspection."

00:35:08.902 --> 00:35:10.777
But "inspection" not a very good word,

00:35:11.111 --> 00:35:14.652
but "nirikshana" means inspection, divine inspection.

00:35:17.277 --> 00:35:19.652
"So all the time I feel that it's You, You,

00:35:19.986 --> 00:35:23.402
You are all the time - when I listen to music

00:35:23.735 --> 00:35:26.819
I feel now, see, She is looking at me,

00:35:27.235 --> 00:35:30.735
She is feeling me, She is nourishing me.

00:35:31.277 --> 00:35:34.527
All the time I feel Your love."

00:35:36.610 --> 00:35:38.861
That's how the bhakti comes in.

00:35:39.277 --> 00:35:40.610
So if you have vibrations

00:35:40.986 --> 00:35:45.193
that doesn't mean that they are something dry, you see?

00:35:46.443 --> 00:35:48.527
No,

00:35:48.861 --> 00:35:52.861
it means the joy of bhakti.

00:35:55.527 --> 00:35:59.111
Bhakti is, you can call it adoration, this, that.

00:35:59.402 --> 00:36:04.443
It's the ocean of love that is God.

00:36:05.443 --> 00:36:07.151
You just get drenched into it.

00:36:07.443 --> 00:36:09.902
There's no words to it.

00:36:14.151 --> 00:36:16.111
And that is what when you feel,

00:36:16.318 --> 00:36:18.694
you must know that

00:36:19.402 --> 00:36:23.402
you have taken the spirit

00:36:24.861 --> 00:36:28.986
as a real connection

00:36:30.402 --> 00:36:33.652
between you and your Mother,

00:36:34.777 --> 00:36:37.318
or your Father.

00:36:39.277 --> 00:36:44.777
There's no differentiation.

00:36:47.193 --> 00:36:50.527
You are one

00:36:50.777 --> 00:36:53.527
in that ocean, drenched in the ocean.

00:36:53.902 --> 00:36:56.569
You are the drop, you are the ocean.

00:36:57.111 --> 00:37:00.151
You are one in that bhakti.

00:37:01.151 --> 00:37:05.151
And that bhakti cannot be mechanical,

00:37:08.443 --> 00:37:11.193
because not man-made.

00:37:14.527 --> 00:37:19.151
So to enjoy Sahaja Yoga

00:37:20.443 --> 00:37:24.443
you must know that it's not dry vibrations only,

00:37:25.111 --> 00:37:27.777
but is the bhakti.

00:37:28.610 --> 00:37:31.069
That is the joy

00:37:31.694 --> 00:37:33.694
of Shiva's quality,

00:37:34.069 --> 00:37:37.485
the quality of joy that He adds

00:37:38.152 --> 00:37:41.027
to our life.

00:37:41.694 --> 00:37:45.902
Everything seems to be surrounded, resounding.

00:37:46.152 --> 00:37:48.235
Same thing the joy,

00:37:48.569 --> 00:37:51.235
that "I'm loved so much by God,

00:37:51.652 --> 00:37:53.694
that God loves me,

00:37:54.027 --> 00:37:56.944
that I have a meaning in life."

00:37:58.443 --> 00:38:03.443
Then the ego drops out first of all,

00:38:05.027 --> 00:38:10.485
and also the conditionings drop out.

00:38:14.443 --> 00:38:17.443
Now the third nadi:

00:38:23.152 --> 00:38:26.152
third nadi

00:38:26.694 --> 00:38:30.610
is the nadi by which we feel attached,

00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:34.610
attached to someone.

00:38:34.944 --> 00:38:39.277
Like this is my child, this is my husband,

00:38:39.861 --> 00:38:41.986
this is my family,

00:38:42.277 --> 00:38:44.527
this is my wife,

00:38:45.235 --> 00:38:48.694
this is my father, this is my mother.

00:38:51.111 --> 00:38:54.735
In the beginning of Sahaja Yoga of everyone,

00:38:55.111 --> 00:38:58.235
when they are just the beginners,

00:38:58.819 --> 00:39:03.152
so they talk about their whole family,

00:39:04.402 --> 00:39:05.861
"My father is like this,

00:39:06.152 --> 00:39:09.111
my mother is sick, my mother's sister's brother's

00:39:09.402 --> 00:39:14.360
this, that's real, this thing, is not well."

00:39:15.152 --> 00:39:19.735
As if, you see, we all have taken a contract.

00:39:21.735 --> 00:39:24.610
What should I do?

00:39:26.318 --> 00:39:30.569
Like today somebody said that "You see,

00:39:31.902 --> 00:39:33.902
they lost their first child.

00:39:34.277 --> 00:39:36.360
First child they lost,

00:39:37.193 --> 00:39:40.069
because the child was sleeping in another room."

00:39:40.277 --> 00:39:44.111
I said, "Small children should sleep with mother,

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:46.277
and mother must look after the children."

00:39:46.443 --> 00:39:47.819
It's simple thing - I mean,

00:39:48.151 --> 00:39:50.652
in India no mother would accept such a situation.

00:39:50.819 --> 00:39:52.485
She'll throw away the husband,

00:39:52.819 --> 00:39:56.027
say, "What's this? I have to look after the child."

00:39:56.360 --> 00:40:01.069
So I said, "Tell them that they should sleep with the child."

00:40:02.485 --> 00:40:03.819
But they don't believe in it.

00:40:04.069 --> 00:40:06.235
So all right - what can we do?

00:40:06.485 --> 00:40:09.360
Have we taken their contract that

00:40:09.694 --> 00:40:11.610
we should look after their children,

00:40:12.027 --> 00:40:15.235
even when they don't want to listen to us?

00:40:16.069 --> 00:40:22.151
So the idea is, all the time in the beginning is that

00:40:22.443 --> 00:40:26.443
"Oh Mother, I've been doing Sahaja Yoga for one month,

00:40:26.777 --> 00:40:31.569
but so far my financial condition has not improved."

00:40:32.569 --> 00:40:35.485
As if they're going to sue Me for that,

00:40:37.151 --> 00:40:40.360
as if I've let them down.

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:45.027
But they don't want to see that

00:40:45.235 --> 00:40:47.443
you have just now come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:40:47.777 --> 00:40:50.069
or even if you have been in Sahaja Yoga for so many years,

00:40:50.318 --> 00:40:53.151
you have not been a Sahaja yogi.

00:40:53.569 --> 00:40:56.027
Something missing, you don't deserve.

00:40:56.318 --> 00:40:59.318
Something wrong with you, not with Sahaja Yoga.

00:40:59.777 --> 00:41:03.318
But they feel that Sahaja Yoga

00:41:03.777 --> 00:41:07.902
is something which has got the contract.

00:41:08.402 --> 00:41:09.652
Immediately they'll inform you,

00:41:09.944 --> 00:41:10.986
"Now somebody is sick there,

00:41:11.193 --> 00:41:13.069
somebody's somebody's somebody's somebody.

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:18.277
Send five Sahaja yogis." For what?

00:41:21.402 --> 00:41:25.402
These attachments start working within us.

00:41:26.235 --> 00:41:28.902
Now some people I've seen

00:41:29.777 --> 00:41:33.235
are very attached to their children

00:41:34.027 --> 00:41:40.193
and they go on pampering, "Oh, my child, my child."

00:41:40.819 --> 00:41:42.193
And suddenly they discover

00:41:42.443 --> 00:41:45.986
the child is now is a devil's child.

00:41:47.402 --> 00:41:49.193
The child starts answering back,

00:41:49.527 --> 00:41:52.193
saying all kinds of things, beating the parents,

00:41:52.527 --> 00:41:55.610
misbehaving, and then they suddenly discover

00:41:56.069 --> 00:41:59.152
that "this is the child whom I have been looking after,

00:41:59.402 --> 00:42:00.485
giving so much love."

00:42:00.777 --> 00:42:02.402
And they feel even worse,

00:42:02.735 --> 00:42:06.152
because "I have done so much for my wife,

00:42:06.485 --> 00:42:07.652
and she is treating me like this."

00:42:07.986 --> 00:42:10.193
"I've done so much for my husband,

00:42:10.527 --> 00:42:11.735
and he is treating me like this."

00:42:12.069 --> 00:42:13.610
Why do you do so much?

00:42:13.861 --> 00:42:15.318
There's no need.

00:42:15.652 --> 00:42:19.735
And if you are doing it, you just do it and you forget it.

00:42:20.861 --> 00:42:22.152
I never feel that way.

00:42:22.527 --> 00:42:25.111
I know of Sahaja yogis for whom I have worked very hard,

00:42:25.402 --> 00:42:27.069
and they have gone down.

00:42:27.402 --> 00:42:28.610
Only thing if I feel anything,

00:42:28.902 --> 00:42:30.652
only God knows where will they jump?

00:42:30.861 --> 00:42:32.485
Where will they be in hell?

00:42:32.735 --> 00:42:35.485
What will happen to them? That's the only concern.

00:42:35.861 --> 00:42:37.485
Not the concern what has happened,

00:42:37.735 --> 00:42:40.151
because nothing can \happen to Me.

00:42:42.944 --> 00:42:44.986
But if they have been sinful

00:42:45.402 --> 00:42:49.861
I just get worried about their future,

00:42:50.235 --> 00:42:53.277
about their lives. That's different.

00:42:53.735 --> 00:42:56.277
So this kind of attachment that is we call in Sanskrit is

00:42:56.610 --> 00:42:59.152
"mamatva" - "this is mine, that's my child,

00:42:59.485 --> 00:43:02.610
my this thing, my that."

00:43:05.277 --> 00:43:09.152
Who are your relations are Sahaja yogis - remember this.

00:43:09.485 --> 00:43:11.235
It's a sentence you must remember,

00:43:11.569 --> 00:43:14.610
"My relations are Sahaja yogis only.

00:43:14.986 --> 00:43:19.360
And anybody who plays against Sahaja yogis,

00:43:19.694 --> 00:43:22.569
troubles Sahaja yogis - that person could be my own wife,

00:43:22.861 --> 00:43:26.402
could be my own child - is not mine."

00:43:27.819 --> 00:43:31.277
Because I'll not allow such a thing to happen.

00:43:31.986 --> 00:43:35.152
This relationship is all right till

00:43:35.610 --> 00:43:39.610
Sahaja yogis are one with each other.

00:43:39.944 --> 00:43:44.610
As soon as somebody tries to harm any other Sahaja yogi,

00:43:45.069 --> 00:43:47.151
then I'm not with that person.

00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:48.861
I've seen there are many like that,

00:43:49.152 --> 00:43:50.694
but very good Sahaja yogis.

00:43:51.027 --> 00:43:52.402
They'll never side with their wives,

00:43:52.694 --> 00:43:54.735
never side with their children,

00:43:55.152 --> 00:43:58.360
because they know if you are siding with them

00:43:58.694 --> 00:44:03.735
you are making them sinful, you're destroying them.

00:44:04.235 --> 00:44:05.819
They're worried about their ascent

00:44:06.151 --> 00:44:09.152
so they'll never allow, never allow anybody,

00:44:09.569 --> 00:44:13.151
a relation of theirs to trouble others.

00:44:14.819 --> 00:44:17.027
I have seen some children

00:44:17.610 --> 00:44:20.027
who are extremely naughty,

00:44:20.277 --> 00:44:23.152
they're very troublesome, very violent,

00:44:23.944 --> 00:44:26.152
and the parents just saying, "Mother, put them right.

00:44:26.485 --> 00:44:29.485
We leave it to You." They are to be put right.

00:44:29.819 --> 00:44:30.861
But others will say,

00:44:31.151 --> 00:44:33.610
"Oh, no, no, no, no; you see my child,

00:44:34.027 --> 00:44:37.360
he cannot do such a thing, you know."

00:44:39.944 --> 00:44:45.027
So one has to understand the discrimination part of it,

00:44:45.402 --> 00:44:49.027
that "Why am I attached?"

00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:52.151
I've given this simile many a times,

00:44:52.402 --> 00:44:54.235
like the sap of the tree rises,

00:44:54.569 --> 00:44:58.027
goes to various places of the trees, various areas,

00:44:58.235 --> 00:45:01.569
looks after the bark, looks after the branch,

00:45:01.861 --> 00:45:03.735
looks after the leaves,

00:45:03.986 --> 00:45:05.777
flowers and fruits, and comes back,

00:45:06.152 --> 00:45:09.193
or it gets evaporated. It doesn't get attached.

00:45:09.944 --> 00:45:12.193
If it gets involved into one of them

00:45:12.527 --> 00:45:13.777
the whole tree will die,

00:45:14.111 --> 00:45:17.111
and that part which

00:45:17.485 --> 00:45:22.318
is so close to the sap will also die.

00:45:22.610 --> 00:45:25.944
But sap has much more sense than we have.

00:45:30.819 --> 00:45:32.569
To them, husband's so important

00:45:32.819 --> 00:45:36.027
- I mean so many problems of husbands, wives, this, that.

00:45:36.318 --> 00:45:39.443
"My God," I sometimes think, "What is this?"

00:45:39.735 --> 00:45:42.443
That's why they used to say, "Take a sanyas"

00:45:42.735 --> 00:45:44.360
- so nobody can talk about wife,

00:45:44.694 --> 00:45:45.944
children, nothing.

00:45:46.152 --> 00:45:50.152
You have to be a sanyasi, first of all be a sanyasi.

00:45:50.569 --> 00:45:51.861
So no headache to the guru.

00:45:52.235 --> 00:45:53.610
As soon as you start talking

00:45:53.944 --> 00:45:56.569
about any one relation of yours, the guru would say,

00:45:56.861 --> 00:46:00.569
"All right, you get out. Nothing doing. No good."

00:46:02.986 --> 00:46:06.111
But in Sahaja Yoga -

00:46:06.402 --> 00:46:10.402
Sahaja Yoga has much deeper

00:46:11.152 --> 00:46:12.610
work to do.

00:46:12.861 --> 00:46:14.777
It has to penetrate into the society,

00:46:15.069 --> 00:46:17.069
into the political life, into economic life.

00:46:17.193 --> 00:46:19.151
You have to emancipate the whole world.

00:46:19.443 --> 00:46:21.694
Try to understand your responsibility.

00:46:23.152 --> 00:46:28.111
You are not only here for one ascetic ascent, no.

00:46:31.610 --> 00:46:33.610
How much wisdom you must have,

00:46:34.069 --> 00:46:35.861
how much love you must have,

00:46:36.402 --> 00:46:39.360
and how much discrimination you must have,

00:46:39.652 --> 00:46:41.318
to understand that you are chosen

00:46:41.652 --> 00:46:44.652
for the emancipation of the whole world.

00:46:48.527 --> 00:46:52.277
So now this so-called limited love,

00:46:52.777 --> 00:46:55.944
what is the solution which takes you to destruction

00:46:56.277 --> 00:46:59.402
is the unlimited love.

00:47:00.652 --> 00:47:05.861
Because Shiva is nothing but love, He's love.

00:47:09.318 --> 00:47:14.735
Love is that corrects, that nourishes,

00:47:16.402 --> 00:47:19.652
that wants your benevolence.

00:47:21.152 --> 00:47:22.861
That's what Shiva is.

00:47:23.152 --> 00:47:26.193
It wants your benevolence.

00:47:27.986 --> 00:47:31.277
It looks after your benevolence.

00:47:31.944 --> 00:47:35.986
So when

00:47:37.069 --> 00:47:42.111
you are looking after the benevolence of others with love,

00:47:44.986 --> 00:47:48.485
then the whole life changes,

00:47:50.735 --> 00:47:53.652
the whole pattern changes,

00:47:54.402 --> 00:47:56.610
and you really enjoy it because

00:47:56.986 --> 00:47:59.152
you become one with so many,

00:47:59.527 --> 00:48:02.318
concerned with so many families, so many things,

00:48:02.735 --> 00:48:07.027
so many problems of others,

00:48:07.485 --> 00:48:10.151
and you just feel you are one with so many.

00:48:10.485 --> 00:48:13.944
Now see, we are so many Sahaja yogis here today.

00:48:14.402 --> 00:48:17.027
First time when I came to Italy,

00:48:17.235 --> 00:48:19.861
I must tell you,

00:48:20.485 --> 00:48:23.485
I came with Christine - no,

00:48:23.819 --> 00:48:27.360
what's the name of Gregoire's wife? Catherine.

00:48:27.902 --> 00:48:30.819
And she was the only one who knew Italian.

00:48:31.193 --> 00:48:33.027
And we had told some newspaper

00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:36.569
to reserve some sort of a hall and advertise for us.

00:48:36.902 --> 00:48:38.360
Nothing was done.

00:48:38.694 --> 00:48:41.569
So when we came we couldn't find anyone.

00:48:41.944 --> 00:48:45.151
So I went round with her to put the posters,

00:48:45.485 --> 00:48:48.193
but still nobody came.

00:48:48.777 --> 00:48:51.069
And today we are so many.

00:48:51.443 --> 00:48:55.777
But we must know that we are bound to each other by love,

00:48:59.027 --> 00:49:04.485
and the love that is for our benevolence, for our ascent.

00:49:06.569 --> 00:49:10.777
And then you just start enjoying everyone.

00:49:11.944 --> 00:49:14.235
And then you don't think what race you are,

00:49:14.485 --> 00:49:16.485
what country you are, what this thing you are,

00:49:16.735 --> 00:49:18.819
nothing - a Sahaja yogi, finished!

00:49:19.151 --> 00:49:22.735
So you become a universal being.

00:49:23.944 --> 00:49:26.694
And this attitude has to be achieved.

00:49:27.151 --> 00:49:29.277
When I hear that some Indian girls

00:49:29.694 --> 00:49:33.610
are tortured and troubled, I think, "How can they do it?"

00:49:34.069 --> 00:49:38.152
Or somebody who has a black skin, they are tortured;

00:49:38.652 --> 00:49:41.318
or some Indians are treating somebody

00:49:41.735 --> 00:49:43.861
because they are of low caste.

00:49:44.193 --> 00:49:45.986
It's not possible,

00:49:46.277 --> 00:49:49.193
because they are all part and parcel of one body.

00:49:49.527 --> 00:49:54.443
They're all brothers and sisters, born of the same Mother.

00:49:55.152 --> 00:49:57.318
But this is only possible

00:49:57.735 --> 00:50:01.610
when you dissolve that limited relationship of yours

00:50:01.986 --> 00:50:04.777
into this great unlimited ocean of love;

00:50:05.152 --> 00:50:07.152
then only it is possible.

00:50:07.610 --> 00:50:10.402
And if it is not there, do not try to justify

00:50:10.777 --> 00:50:13.152
- just watch yourself.

00:50:13.944 --> 00:50:19.193
See for yourself: are you really in love with everyone?

00:50:20.735 --> 00:50:24.610
You see, I would say that

00:50:25.735 --> 00:50:28.485
all the time when I - sometimes I go for shopping,

00:50:28.735 --> 00:50:32.111
I just think, "Oh, this one would be nice for this one,

00:50:32.402 --> 00:50:34.861
that will be nice for that one."

00:50:35.152 --> 00:50:37.069
For Myself if you say,

00:50:37.402 --> 00:50:39.777
it's impossible for Me to buy anything for Myself,

00:50:40.069 --> 00:50:43.485
impossible situation.

00:50:45.152 --> 00:50:47.777
Unless and until it is absolutely immediate,

00:50:48.402 --> 00:50:52.069
or some problem is there if I am just without it.

00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:55.111
I won't even buy a drink for Myself,

00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:56.819
even if I am thirsty.

00:50:57.193 --> 00:51:00.151
Because the whole thing is the joy of others.

00:51:00.527 --> 00:51:03.111
"Oh, this will be nice for that person.

00:51:03.235 --> 00:51:05.986
This will be good for that person."

00:51:10.151 --> 00:51:14.902
All this is the most enjoyable thing.

00:51:15.151 --> 00:51:18.235
I mean, why all this is for there?

00:51:18.694 --> 00:51:20.443
After all, think about yourself,

00:51:20.819 --> 00:51:23.694
"Why am I here?

00:51:26.111 --> 00:51:29.652
I'm here to enjoy everyone - everyone.

00:51:30.193 --> 00:51:33.027
They are all realized souls,

00:51:33.694 --> 00:51:36.902
such beautiful lotuses.

00:51:37.652 --> 00:51:41.527
I'm not going to stoop down to the mud.

00:51:41.902 --> 00:51:44.902
Now I am a lotus."

00:51:47.777 --> 00:51:53.235
That is the way you open the heart,

00:51:55.443 --> 00:51:58.111
the lotus of your heart.

00:51:58.443 --> 00:52:03.151
And the fragrance of such a person is so beautiful,

00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:08.694
is so beautiful.

00:52:10.694 --> 00:52:13.235
So you are no more divisive,

00:52:13.652 --> 00:52:15.986
you do not want to separate from each other.

00:52:16.235 --> 00:52:20.569
Anywhere is done, you are agreeable to that;

00:52:20.902 --> 00:52:22.694
you don't think that it should be done here

00:52:23.027 --> 00:52:25.111
or there or there, but anywhere

00:52:25.318 --> 00:52:29.902
- but should be all of us together.

00:52:31.527 --> 00:52:36.111
So the small attachments that are with you

00:52:36.902 --> 00:52:40.360
have to be dissolved into this ocean of love,

00:52:40.694 --> 00:52:44.193
which is Shiva.

00:52:49.944 --> 00:52:53.235
Fourth one is the most important

00:52:53.777 --> 00:52:56.027
for all of us is to know

00:52:56.360 --> 00:53:00.235
that there's a nadi which passes through left Vishuddhi

00:53:01.610 --> 00:53:03.443
into the heart.

00:53:03.694 --> 00:53:07.027
Starts from the heart, goes up,

00:53:07.819 --> 00:53:09.902
passes through Agnya.

00:53:10.235 --> 00:53:13.944
It has four petals, and opens up.

00:53:18.944 --> 00:53:22.027
This is the one which gives

00:53:22.652 --> 00:53:26.443
you the state which is called as turya.

00:53:26.819 --> 00:53:30.902
We live in three states.

00:53:31.193 --> 00:53:34.694
In the living - in the awakened state,

00:53:35.027 --> 00:53:39.111
jagruti, our attention goes to this, that, and all that;

00:53:39.318 --> 00:53:41.902
we spoil our attention.

00:53:44.443 --> 00:53:48.777
But the second one is the one what we call

00:53:49.111 --> 00:53:50.819
is that we sleep.

00:53:51.027 --> 00:53:54.777
When we sleep also

00:53:55.735 --> 00:53:57.277
all these things that have happened

00:53:57.569 --> 00:54:00.443
come to us from our past and things like that.

00:54:02.569 --> 00:54:06.443
But then we go to the deeper sleep called as sushupti.

00:54:08.111 --> 00:54:11.652
Is a state where

00:54:12.569 --> 00:54:14.902
you have deep sleep,

00:54:15.193 --> 00:54:18.986
and you dream of something that is reality also.

00:54:19.986 --> 00:54:23.111
You may dream about Me.

00:54:23.986 --> 00:54:28.193
Like it's the ethereal part of the subconscious,

00:54:28.652 --> 00:54:32.861
where some beautiful

00:54:33.193 --> 00:54:34.902
informations are passed on.

00:54:35.152 --> 00:54:37.402
Supposing I've come, say, to Italy.

00:54:37.652 --> 00:54:39.527
Italians might know in their sushupti

00:54:39.861 --> 00:54:42.318
that I have come here, or maybe anybody might know

00:54:42.652 --> 00:54:44.318
- depends on.

00:54:44.652 --> 00:54:46.527
But the fourth state is called as turya.

00:54:46.777 --> 00:54:48.111
There are two more states.

00:54:48.402 --> 00:54:50.277
You are in the turya state, it's the fourth,

00:54:50.610 --> 00:54:52.318
"turya" means fourth.

00:54:52.735 --> 00:54:56.402
Fourth state is where that you are

00:54:56.777 --> 00:54:59.861
in a thoughtless awareness state.

00:55:01.485 --> 00:55:06.318
When there is no thought - just think of it

00:55:07.318 --> 00:55:11.402
- when there is no thought, you have to be innocent.

00:55:12.277 --> 00:55:16.777
When there is no thought, you have to have vibrations.

00:55:17.735 --> 00:55:21.652
When there is no thought, you cannot be attached to anyone.

00:55:22.652 --> 00:55:25.069
So into that thoughtless state you have come now,

00:55:25.318 --> 00:55:26.986
is the "turya sthiti."

00:55:27.277 --> 00:55:30.986
And in this state when you are,

00:55:32.777 --> 00:55:37.069
these four petals which are within you

00:55:37.610 --> 00:55:41.402
have to open out in your brain.

00:55:43.111 --> 00:55:46.610
They come from your heart to your brain.

00:55:49.861 --> 00:55:54.777
And that is when

00:55:57.277 --> 00:56:02.986
you absolutely understand what is God,

00:56:08.069 --> 00:56:12.902
absolutely you know what is God is.

00:56:14.986 --> 00:56:19.360
That is the time when

00:56:22.193 --> 00:56:26.443
one receives the real knowledge.

00:56:32.986 --> 00:56:36.027
But unless and until these four petals open,

00:56:36.318 --> 00:56:38.151
one may fall back,

00:56:38.569 --> 00:56:41.235
and that's why some of the Sahaja yogis

00:56:41.694 --> 00:56:46.235
who are still meddling with things

00:56:46.777 --> 00:56:49.986
that they should not do, go down.

00:56:50.652 --> 00:56:55.360
And they don't understand what is God is.

00:56:57.151 --> 00:56:59.193
But it's not the understanding

00:56:59.527 --> 00:57:01.360
- in a way you understand this one little point,

00:57:01.777 --> 00:57:05.569
that it comes from your heart into your brain,

00:57:06.111 --> 00:57:09.527
not from brain to your heart.

00:57:11.902 --> 00:57:14.819
It comes

00:57:15.193 --> 00:57:18.443
as if the ambrosia of

00:57:18.735 --> 00:57:22.986
your bhakti covers your brain, absolutely.

00:57:25.610 --> 00:57:26.735
Say for example,

00:57:26.986 --> 00:57:30.069
Shankaracharya wrote a beautiful treatise

00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:31.694
called as "Viveka Chudamani"

00:57:31.986 --> 00:57:34.610
where he described what is God, this, that;

00:57:34.861 --> 00:57:37.360
and "viveka" means the conscience,

00:57:37.735 --> 00:57:41.485
and consciousness and all that he described quite a lot.

00:57:42.861 --> 00:57:45.069
But there was one horrible fellow called Sarma

00:57:45.318 --> 00:57:48.527
who started arguing with him and he got fed up,

00:57:48.861 --> 00:57:50.277
Shankaracharya.

00:57:50.569 --> 00:57:52.861
He said, "No use talking to them."

00:57:53.111 --> 00:57:55.986
So he just wrote "Saundarya Lahari."

00:57:56.318 --> 00:57:59.151
"Saundarya Lahari" is nothing but all the mantras

00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:00.193
praising the Mother.

00:58:00.527 --> 00:58:02.819
He said, "Why, I know Mother, now let me praise Her.

00:58:03.111 --> 00:58:06.694
Nothing doing - what's the use of talking to these people?

00:58:07.151 --> 00:58:09.235
Stupid things, how will they understand?"

00:58:09.652 --> 00:58:14.151
He realized that "These people haven't got that capacity,

00:58:14.443 --> 00:58:19.027
that sensitivity to understand what I know."

00:58:19.443 --> 00:58:24.777
That's the real knowledge, is to know what is God.

00:58:25.193 --> 00:58:27.652
And if that is God,

00:58:27.986 --> 00:58:31.193
then how can you suspect anything,

00:58:31.527 --> 00:58:34.527
how can you

00:58:35.485 --> 00:58:37.485
try to analyze anything?

00:58:37.777 --> 00:58:41.485
It's God. It's God Almighty,

00:58:41.944 --> 00:58:44.193
which knows everything,

00:58:44.610 --> 00:58:46.610
which does everything,

00:58:47.069 --> 00:58:49.777
which enjoys everything.

00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:54.152
That is the one you should say is the gyana,

00:58:54.485 --> 00:58:56.193
is the knowledge, is the true knowledge,

00:58:56.485 --> 00:58:57.610
the pure knowledge.

00:58:57.944 --> 00:59:00.152
It's not the knowledge of chakras,

00:59:00.527 --> 00:59:02.527
not the knowledge of vibrations,

00:59:02.986 --> 00:59:04.777
not the knowledge of kundalini,

00:59:05.111 --> 00:59:09.527
but the knowledge of God Almighty.

00:59:10.027 --> 00:59:13.610
And the knowledge of God Almighty is not mental.

00:59:13.944 --> 00:59:15.151
Again I tell you,

00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:19.902
it starts from your heart and goes to your brain,

00:59:20.694 --> 00:59:27.360
something that comes out of your experience of joy

00:59:27.777 --> 00:59:29.069
and covers your brain.

00:59:29.318 --> 00:59:31.944
So your brain cannot deny it any more.

00:59:32.235 --> 00:59:35.152
Like the - sometimes when you have your mother,

00:59:35.485 --> 00:59:38.610
little mother, you know the love of your mother.

00:59:38.944 --> 00:59:42.151
But you cannot explain, it comes from your heart

00:59:42.485 --> 00:59:43.902
and you say, "No, that's my mother,

00:59:44.151 --> 00:59:47.027
she won't do like that. I know my mother very well."

00:59:47.443 --> 00:59:49.151
The knowledge about your mother,

00:59:49.485 --> 00:59:51.902
the one who has given you birth;

00:59:52.318 --> 00:59:55.777
may not be, mother may not be very good or whatever it is.

00:59:56.151 --> 00:59:58.485
But knowledge about God,

00:59:58.902 --> 01:00:01.069
that He's love, that He's truth,

01:00:01.443 --> 01:00:03.193
that He knows everything,

01:00:03.569 --> 01:00:08.694
that just become part and parcel of your being, absolutely,

01:00:09.027 --> 01:00:13.652
and that's the time we say is the nirvana.

01:00:15.652 --> 01:00:17.443
So it's important,

01:00:17.777 --> 01:00:20.694
specially for the people of the West,

01:00:21.027 --> 01:00:23.151
now open your hearts,

01:00:23.443 --> 01:00:27.569
because it starts from the heart, not from your brain.

01:00:31.944 --> 01:00:34.443
Do not judge people on vibrations.

01:00:34.777 --> 01:00:38.318
Judge yourself, all the time.

01:00:38.777 --> 01:00:43.777
I had told that Shiva Puja means more explanation,

01:00:44.027 --> 01:00:46.069
more understanding, more this thing;

01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:52.235
because in other pujas we do all these mantras, this, that,

01:00:53.902 --> 01:00:59.152
but in this puja is to know the knowledge,

01:00:59.610 --> 01:01:02.443
it's God.

01:01:02.902 --> 01:01:06.902
And to know that you know God itself is so great.

01:01:09.402 --> 01:01:12.735
Whatever it is - She may be Mahamaya,

01:01:12.986 --> 01:01:16.402
She may be anything, but I know Her.

01:01:16.902 --> 01:01:18.527
It cannot be described in one book,

01:01:18.777 --> 01:01:21.443
it cannot be described in hundred books.

01:01:21.902 --> 01:01:24.861
It cannot be described in words,

01:01:25.193 --> 01:01:29.777
but to know that's God - after all, that's God,

01:01:30.277 --> 01:01:33.069
God Almighty.

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:38.151
And that gives you

01:01:38.443 --> 01:01:42.027
that beautiful surrender,

01:01:42.443 --> 01:01:46.235
where you just feel absolutely secured

01:01:48.694 --> 01:01:51.694
in that ocean of love.

01:01:52.485 --> 01:01:55.152
I wish you all to achieve that state.

01:01:56.152 --> 01:01:59.610
May God bless you.
