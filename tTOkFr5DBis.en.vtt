WEBVTT

02:42.069 --> 02:45.610
Today we have assembled here

02:46.069 --> 02:50.819
to worship Sadashiva,

02:51.111 --> 02:57.402
which is reflected within us as Shiva, as the spirit.

03:01.610 --> 03:04.735
He is reflected in our heart,

03:06.735 --> 03:12.485
and as you have seen

03:13.944 --> 03:20.235
that the goal of our life

03:21.861 --> 03:27.861
was to achieve this state of spirit.

03:32.861 --> 03:36.652
The other day I was reading some books

03:38.402 --> 03:43.485
how it was done,

03:47.652 --> 03:52.193
this Self-realization, to know the spirit,

03:52.902 --> 03:57.652
and how people were tortured.

03:59.151 --> 04:04.569
First of all they're asked to

04:06.902 --> 04:12.735
somehow or other deny, defy and condemn their body.

04:15.277 --> 04:19.902
Now, if the body wants to have comfort,

04:21.151 --> 04:29.694
then it was said that first try to sleep on the carpet,

04:30.111 --> 04:32.861
not on the bed.

04:33.986 --> 04:37.777
Then still, it's not enough;

04:38.277 --> 04:41.277
then from the carpet you go to a mat

04:42.652 --> 04:44.443
still is not enough.

04:44.777 --> 04:48.111
Then from that maybe,

04:49.527 --> 04:52.193
you move down

04:53.235 --> 04:57.069
to the Mother Earth,

04:57.360 --> 04:59.485
sleep on the Mother Earth.

05:00.318 --> 05:04.193
Still if the body is not all right

05:04.443 --> 05:08.777
then you start sleeping on the stone.

05:09.318 --> 05:13.027
But still the Himalayas are far away,

05:13.777 --> 05:16.235
because Shiva resides in Kailasha.

05:16.569 --> 05:21.235
So you go to Himalayas and sleep on the ice.

05:21.569 --> 05:26.069
This was the minimum requirement.

05:27.360 --> 05:34.777
Then it was said that you are fond of good food,

05:37.027 --> 05:39.443
you want to have sumptuous food,

05:39.777 --> 05:42.694
you eat a lot, all right;

05:43.318 --> 05:46.819
so you deny everything that you like, to begin with,

05:47.151 --> 05:48.944
all that you like.

05:49.360 --> 05:52.610
For example, Italians cannot eat pasta!

05:58.235 --> 06:02.819
Then deny that.

06:04.443 --> 06:06.986
But that's not sufficient.

06:07.443 --> 06:10.694
After that you start eating things

06:11.402 --> 06:13.443
which are very bitter.

06:13.777 --> 06:17.193
As in the Zen system they give you to eat

06:17.527 --> 06:21.235
something which is like quinine raised to power 108,

06:21.569 --> 06:26.360
absolutely bitter - or absolutely sweet.

06:26.694 --> 06:30.111
So put your tongue into test.

06:31.569 --> 06:34.402
But still the stomach is there.

06:34.694 --> 06:37.402
So if you are eating too much,

06:37.694 --> 06:41.318
you fast for one day. That's not sufficient.

06:41.694 --> 06:43.652
Then fast for seven days.

06:43.986 --> 06:45.777
Then for forty days.

06:46.151 --> 06:50.527
I mean, a month has got only thirty days;

06:50.819 --> 06:53.777
to fast for forty days means you are already finished.

06:54.111 --> 06:58.986
That's how if you have to do your penance for nirvana.

06:59.235 --> 07:00.694
As it is you get a nirvana

07:01.027 --> 07:03.193
because you're finished and dead, you see,

07:03.569 --> 07:07.986
nothing is left out of you, nothing but bones,

07:08.235 --> 07:12.151
and these bones then become nirvana.

07:12.610 --> 07:14.485
Ultimately the death follows,

07:14.819 --> 07:16.235
so you are finished and there is nirvana,

07:16.485 --> 07:18.819
no doubt about it.

07:20.986 --> 07:23.111
Then you don't live in a house,

07:23.443 --> 07:25.193
because house is comfort.

07:25.527 --> 07:28.902
Give up your wife, give up your children, give up everyone.

07:31.111 --> 07:34.318
Now wear only one something,

07:35.569 --> 07:38.027
like a cloth tied round,

07:41.443 --> 07:48.069
and go and ask for alms from people.

07:54.235 --> 07:58.069
With these clothes also there's still problem,

07:58.360 --> 08:00.819
because you're attached to your cloth.

08:01.235 --> 08:04.443
So you go to Himalayas where there's nobody to see you,

08:04.819 --> 08:05.944
take out your clothes

08:06.193 --> 08:10.360
and in that cold you stay there, completely shaking.

08:10.944 --> 08:12.485
Then you'll get your nirvana.

08:12.819 --> 08:15.652
As it is you get nirvana.

08:18.819 --> 08:22.027
All such conditions were put

08:25.193 --> 08:30.569
as to destroy the demands of your body to begin with.

08:32.902 --> 08:34.569
You tell your body, "No, nothing doing.

08:34.986 --> 08:39.819
You better work out your nirvana."

08:40.986 --> 08:45.902
The second thing was to destroy your mind

08:48.193 --> 08:51.235
which takes you to senses,

08:51.652 --> 08:54.694
to things of joy.

08:55.235 --> 08:59.360
Supposing you want to have some,

09:03.027 --> 09:05.318
something very much,

09:05.777 --> 09:09.902
so deny that, deny that.

09:10.527 --> 09:12.443
Anything that your mind tells you,

09:12.777 --> 09:15.527
just say "No, no, no" to it.

09:16.193 --> 09:18.777
In Sanskrit

09:20.861 --> 09:22.861
the shloka is like this,

09:23.152 --> 09:25.569
"Yat neti neti vachane, nigamo vacha"

09:25.861 --> 09:26.944
- which you go on saying,

09:27.235 --> 09:31.152
"neti, neti": "No, not this, not this, not this, not this."

09:31.777 --> 09:34.694
And then you can discuss about

09:35.027 --> 09:37.861
- discuss only, yes - nirvana.

09:38.277 --> 09:43.652
Before that you are not even worthy of discussion of nirvana.

09:45.861 --> 09:47.277
When I read this book I said,

09:47.527 --> 09:50.861
"Baba, I give up. It's too much."

09:55.152 --> 09:58.069
But in Sahaja Yoga

09:59.652 --> 10:01.193
is the other way round,

10:01.485 --> 10:04.318
like building first the pinnacle of the building,

10:04.652 --> 10:07.318
and then the foundation.

10:08.193 --> 10:12.527
Opening your Sahasrara was the first thing was achieved.

10:13.277 --> 10:16.402
And then in the light of Sahasrara

10:16.986 --> 10:20.152
you have to watch yourself and see for yourself.

10:21.318 --> 10:26.111
Gradually the introspection was a better thing,

10:27.193 --> 10:29.861
through vibrations

10:31.193 --> 10:34.527
is to see why:

10:34.777 --> 10:36.986
why I want this?

10:37.318 --> 10:40.277
Why my attention goes to my comfort?

10:40.777 --> 10:43.151
Why my attention goes to food,

10:43.527 --> 10:46.652
why to my family, why to my children,

10:47.027 --> 10:50.277
when I have to achieve the highest?

10:50.777 --> 10:53.527
So you start introspecting yourself.

10:54.027 --> 10:57.111
Then you know on your vibrations also

10:57.402 --> 11:00.111
there's something wrong with you.

11:00.861 --> 11:03.777
Then you don't try to see others,

11:04.027 --> 11:07.151
what's wrong with others, you start seeing yourself;

11:07.443 --> 11:13.151
because it's your own ascent

11:13.861 --> 11:16.527
you have to achieve.

11:19.443 --> 11:22.193
But in the olden times,

11:23.193 --> 11:28.193
all these things were done individually.

11:29.443 --> 11:32.694
Like a one person who starts

11:33.193 --> 11:36.235
the path of nirvana,

11:40.111 --> 11:45.152
he used to go into ekant, means into lonely places,

11:45.735 --> 11:47.902
stay away from people, avoid them,

11:48.193 --> 11:49.652
have nothing to do,

11:49.986 --> 11:53.902
and achieve this ascent,

11:54.861 --> 11:58.193
Self-realization, only for himself.

12:00.402 --> 12:02.986
It was not for others.

12:03.527 --> 12:07.193
Then this gentleman became absolutely exclusive.

12:07.777 --> 12:09.193
He wouldn't talk to anyone,

12:09.443 --> 12:11.527
he wouldn't meet anybody

12:12.027 --> 12:13.360
and he would sit somewhere

12:13.735 --> 12:18.235
on top of a remote mountain.

12:20.069 --> 12:22.069
Anybody who tried to meet him

12:22.277 --> 12:25.569
he would throw stones or say all kinds of horrible things,

12:25.861 --> 12:28.569
and never meet that person.

12:32.402 --> 12:36.610
But Sahaja Yoga is not the same thing.

12:37.902 --> 12:41.235
Sahaja Yoga is the ascent of the whole.

12:44.569 --> 12:47.485
This kind of singular achievements

12:47.819 --> 12:50.485
did not lead people anywhere.

12:51.402 --> 12:55.360
Saints of course tried to talk to people,

12:55.735 --> 12:58.152
tell them about Self-realization, about God,

12:58.569 --> 13:02.360
about righteousness, about value system;

13:02.944 --> 13:07.902
but they too were regarded as something strange,

13:08.735 --> 13:12.069
and were tortured and troubled.

13:14.277 --> 13:20.027
So on the level of an individual ascent,

13:20.610 --> 13:22.735
they couldn't do anything for others

13:23.069 --> 13:25.819
except for talking about it, telling about it,

13:26.151 --> 13:30.485
till Sahaja Yoga came.

13:31.069 --> 13:34.819
Even the talking about it was prohibited.

13:36.235 --> 13:40.485
Till the twelfth century in India

13:40.902 --> 13:44.360
nobody talked about it to the public.

13:46.027 --> 13:47.819
It was all in Sanskrit,

13:48.151 --> 13:50.944
very difficult Sanskrit books

13:51.360 --> 13:54.235
which were only available to few aspirants.

13:54.610 --> 13:57.569
Was explained to very, very few even,

13:58.277 --> 14:02.694
amounting to few numbers of people.

14:05.027 --> 14:09.944
But giving realization was denied.

14:11.235 --> 14:15.027
So only one master had one disciple,

14:15.902 --> 14:18.610
and all was the individual ascent,

14:18.944 --> 14:20.735
individual working out.

14:21.069 --> 14:23.360
Such a disciple was taken away from others

14:23.694 --> 14:25.902
and was kept in secret,

14:26.277 --> 14:28.193
worked it out on him;

14:28.318 --> 14:32.944
and just he may sing, he may write poems,

14:33.235 --> 14:35.944
he may talk about it, he might say what his joy is,

14:36.318 --> 14:40.151
but he had no right to give realization to anyone,

14:40.485 --> 14:43.193
neither he knew how to give realization.

14:45.360 --> 14:48.485
So now you see how far you have gone.

14:49.027 --> 14:51.485
You've got your realization

14:52.027 --> 14:54.694
without giving up much.

14:56.485 --> 14:59.944
You can work on a much wider scale,

15:00.443 --> 15:02.819
you can give realizations to other.

15:03.151 --> 15:06.694
You know about all the subtle knowledge

15:07.027 --> 15:10.902
about Sahaja Yoga.

15:13.443 --> 15:15.569
But today I'm going to tell you something more

15:15.986 --> 15:18.277
which we have to know.

15:20.193 --> 15:22.694
It's very important to know,

15:23.151 --> 15:27.861
because as was described by people

15:29.151 --> 15:33.861
that they practice Sahaja Yoga as they go to church,

15:35.402 --> 15:38.986
but it's not from their heart.

15:41.902 --> 15:45.111
And heart is the abode of the spirit

15:47.443 --> 15:51.277
- is the Shiva within us.

15:53.027 --> 15:55.902
So we have to know more about heart,

15:56.527 --> 16:00.277
and that is very important.

16:01.735 --> 16:04.610
You know about these three nadis we have:

16:05.069 --> 16:06.861
Ida, Pingala, Sushumna;

16:07.819 --> 16:10.944
but in the heart there are four nadis.

16:14.777 --> 16:19.111
And the one nadi goes to Mooladhara,

16:22.318 --> 16:26.360
and if you cross the limits of Mooladhara it goes to hell.

16:26.694 --> 16:31.027
That's why they say that Shiva is a destroyer.

16:31.485 --> 16:35.193
Actually you ask for your destruction.

16:37.193 --> 16:42.151
And when you ask for your destruction, you have it.

16:46.819 --> 16:50.694
Even if it destroys everything, as I was telling,

16:51.318 --> 16:55.443
it's like when a fruit has to come,

16:55.861 --> 16:59.443
the petals look as if they're destroyed

16:59.777 --> 17:02.443
- as I have destroyed, I would say, many of your things:

17:02.861 --> 17:05.402
you can call it like your conditionings,

17:05.694 --> 17:07.986
your ego, your racialism, your fanaticism.

17:08.402 --> 17:11.443
All this has been destroyed in Sahaja Yoga.

17:11.902 --> 17:14.527
This has to be destroyed

17:15.027 --> 17:18.151
for the beauty to come out.

17:19.318 --> 17:25.443
So when your maryadas

17:25.902 --> 17:30.527
you cross beyond certain point,

17:31.402 --> 17:34.610
you go to your destruction.

17:37.652 --> 17:41.443
In four directions there are destructions built,

17:41.902 --> 17:44.777
as there are four nadis.

17:46.402 --> 17:49.069
So now, what is to be done?

17:50.111 --> 17:54.111
How are we to stop this destruction of the,

17:54.527 --> 17:57.861
through the first nadi, going to hell?

17:59.402 --> 18:03.861
One of the qualities of Shiva is that He's innocence.

18:04.777 --> 18:07.861
He's extremely innocent. He's innocent like a child.

18:08.193 --> 18:11.277
He is innocence personified.

18:14.318 --> 18:17.485
So

18:19.235 --> 18:25.819
we have to put our carnal desires,

18:26.902 --> 18:29.777
dissolve them,

18:31.485 --> 18:36.318
dissolve them into the innocence,

18:36.694 --> 18:39.944
the ocean of innocence.

18:42.652 --> 18:47.235
You have to dissolve it in the ocean of innocence.

18:49.485 --> 18:55.235
Innocence is something to be appreciated,

18:55.569 --> 18:59.777
to be understood, to be enjoyed.

19:00.193 --> 19:03.902
Like you see animals, they're innocent;

19:04.902 --> 19:09.652
you see children, they're innocent;

19:10.443 --> 19:12.652
flowers, they're innocent.

19:14.027 --> 19:17.944
Divert your attention

19:20.027 --> 19:22.777
to all these things.

19:27.152 --> 19:30.610
You see, on walking on the street,

19:31.193 --> 19:34.111
what is there to see best

19:34.443 --> 19:38.193
is all at three feet height.

19:39.652 --> 19:43.111
You see at three feet height all the flowers,

19:43.443 --> 19:45.443
all the beautiful grass,

19:45.861 --> 19:50.151
all the children who are about three feet are the best.

19:51.151 --> 19:54.777
You need not see people who are above that.

19:57.694 --> 20:01.402
Just see on three feet level.

20:04.902 --> 20:09.902
You can see the legs of somebody, that's all right.

20:11.569 --> 20:14.777
But you don't see the eyes of a person

20:15.151 --> 20:18.027
who are not innocent.

20:18.944 --> 20:22.485
So dissolve this desire

20:24.069 --> 20:26.652
into innocence.

20:28.069 --> 20:31.277
And this Mooladhara which is innocent

20:33.152 --> 20:36.861
is not dead, finished, but is innocent,

20:38.193 --> 20:40.318
it is righteous,

20:40.735 --> 20:43.402
it is Shri Ganesha's qualities,

20:45.610 --> 20:47.735
it's pure.

20:48.111 --> 20:50.277
So even if you are in this world,

20:50.527 --> 20:52.944
even if you are living like a human being,

20:53.318 --> 20:55.735
even if you have children,

20:56.527 --> 20:59.610
still you are innocent.

21:01.527 --> 21:06.735
Like once the wives of Shri Krishna

21:07.111 --> 21:10.069
- He had sixteen thousand wives to begin with,

21:10.402 --> 21:12.360
and the five more.

21:12.777 --> 21:14.485
The sixteen thousand were His powers,

21:14.819 --> 21:17.652
and five were the elements.

21:20.360 --> 21:26.111
They were wanting to go to pray to some big well-known,

21:28.151 --> 21:32.652
I should say, saint had come, a maharshi had come.

21:33.027 --> 21:36.569
So they wanted to go and see him and pay respects.

21:37.193 --> 21:40.569
So they asked Shri Krishna's permission,

21:40.944 --> 21:45.151
but when they went they found the river was all in spate,

21:45.902 --> 21:49.652
so flooded they could not cross over.

21:50.402 --> 21:51.986
They came back, they said,

21:52.277 --> 21:57.235
"How can we cross over this river? It's all in spate."

21:58.152 --> 21:59.485
So this Krishna said,

21:59.819 --> 22:01.610
"All right, you just go and say,

22:02.151 --> 22:06.360
РІР‚В˜If Shri Krishna is Yogeshwara,

22:07.111 --> 22:12.193
and if He is absolutely innocent about sex,

22:13.652 --> 22:15.944
you go down.'"

22:19.069 --> 22:20.777
They said, "How can we? We are so many wives.

22:21.111 --> 22:23.360
What is He talking about?"

22:24.819 --> 22:27.527
So they went down and said this to the river,

22:27.986 --> 22:30.652
and the river went down, and they were surprised that

22:31.069 --> 22:35.277
"this husband of ours is saying all these things."

22:39.235 --> 22:44.111
They went across and worshipped that rishi

22:45.151 --> 22:49.111
and they were coming back, again the river was in floods.

22:51.069 --> 22:52.819
So they went back to the rishi, said,

22:53.111 --> 22:55.527
"Now how are we to cross over because it's in floods?"

22:55.986 --> 22:57.111
He said, "How did you come?"

22:57.360 --> 23:00.277
So they told the story of Shri Krishna.

23:00.944 --> 23:03.819
Now they had fed this rishi with food and fruits

23:04.151 --> 23:06.944
and he had eaten such a lot.

23:07.360 --> 23:10.735
"All right, you go and tell this river that

23:11.069 --> 23:14.151
this rishi has not eaten at all anything."

23:14.569 --> 23:16.694
They said, "How can it be? Just now you ate before us."

23:17.111 --> 23:18.569
He said, "Just go and see."

23:18.902 --> 23:24.527
They went back and told this to the river.

23:26.443 --> 23:29.652
The river again went down.

23:32.360 --> 23:34.902
So to live in this world,

23:35.527 --> 23:37.902
to be a wife or to be a husband,

23:38.235 --> 23:43.360
to be married, whatever it is,

23:45.193 --> 23:47.986
you can be innocent,

23:48.569 --> 23:51.819
absolutely innocent about it.

23:52.360 --> 23:55.527
That's the sign of your purity.

23:58.819 --> 24:03.819
The second nadi, the second channel

24:04.235 --> 24:07.694
that can take you to destruction is desire.

24:08.777 --> 24:11.318
That's why Buddha has said that desirelessness

24:11.819 --> 24:15.443
is the only way that people do not get old,

24:15.819 --> 24:18.151
nor sick,

24:19.193 --> 24:22.027
nor worried.

24:25.777 --> 24:29.318
Now this desire that we have,

24:30.318 --> 24:32.111
"I want this,"

24:32.318 --> 24:35.652
in the West is much more than anywhere else

24:36.027 --> 24:38.151
because the entrepreneurs are every day

24:38.443 --> 24:40.694
producing new things.

24:41.111 --> 24:44.777
Say for example a hairdress,

24:45.151 --> 24:47.694
so the women want to buy this wig or that wig,

24:47.986 --> 24:51.193
"It's my desire, I must have this wig to put on my head."

24:51.652 --> 24:55.569
The another one says, "All right, I must have this one."

24:57.569 --> 25:03.652
And the desire, for men, is "Oh, if he is having

25:04.027 --> 25:07.527
a Rolls Royce, why shouldn't I have one?"

25:10.318 --> 25:13.777
They cannot enjoy somebody else's Rolls Royce.

25:15.694 --> 25:20.861
It should be your own, that "I should have the possession."

25:22.443 --> 25:26.777
Desires can be of any kind, not only material.

25:27.235 --> 25:32.360
The desires could be also

25:32.819 --> 25:35.027
quite mental,

25:37.069 --> 25:39.902
"I must possess this woman,

25:40.360 --> 25:43.235
I must possess this child."

25:43.902 --> 25:48.569
All kinds of possessions that work into you as desires.

25:49.819 --> 25:53.360
But I wouldn't say it is because of attachment.

25:55.360 --> 25:59.819
It's not attachment, but it is just to have more.

26:06.318 --> 26:13.027
Go on adding up things, getting things

26:16.694 --> 26:20.819
- still one doesn't feel happy and satisfied.

26:23.069 --> 26:25.360
What is the reason

26:26.694 --> 26:30.986
for this kind of a desire is that it's not pure desire.

26:31.861 --> 26:34.485
It's an impure desire.

26:35.152 --> 26:36.694
It's an impure desire,

26:36.944 --> 26:39.152
and when such a desire starts working

26:39.485 --> 26:41.485
you can go any far,

26:41.861 --> 26:44.277
like Saddam Hussein, like Hitler,

26:44.527 --> 26:46.111
like anything is nothing

26:46.402 --> 26:50.944
but absolutely desire beyond

26:52.986 --> 26:55.861
any limitations.

26:56.735 --> 26:59.360
You want to dominate others

27:01.111 --> 27:03.735
is also another desire.

27:06.277 --> 27:08.402
All these desires

27:09.527 --> 27:13.277
lead you ultimately to a destruction,

27:15.485 --> 27:17.694
because there's no joy,

27:18.152 --> 27:20.235
there's no happiness.

27:22.277 --> 27:28.402
For example, now I want to have a sari,

27:31.861 --> 27:34.527
so I want to buy a sari.

27:35.861 --> 27:38.402
All my attention will be how will I get that sari,

27:38.735 --> 27:40.861
I must get that sari, this thing, that thing.

27:41.152 --> 27:45.944
The attention becomes polluted,

27:46.402 --> 27:50.527
disturbed, for a nonsensical thing like a sari.

27:50.944 --> 27:54.944
The attention which has to enjoy,

27:56.277 --> 27:59.610
which has to enjoy the spirit,

28:01.235 --> 28:03.819
which has to nourish the spirit,

28:04.152 --> 28:10.111
becomes disturbed because of desires.

28:11.986 --> 28:15.152
In the first place the attention

28:15.485 --> 28:19.360
is disturbed because we are not innocent.

28:20.610 --> 28:24.485
In the second place the attention

28:25.402 --> 28:29.694
gets into turmoil because we have desire.

28:34.527 --> 28:39.735
So what should we do as far as the desire is concerned?

28:43.694 --> 28:46.485
The desire for beautiful things

28:48.610 --> 28:52.527
- we can shift our desire,

28:53.360 --> 28:56.152
material desire into aesthetics,

28:56.610 --> 29:01.111
and have one thing but which is really aesthetically rich;

29:02.944 --> 29:05.819
because that's the quality of Shiva,

29:06.111 --> 29:09.819
that He gives aesthetics to everything.

29:10.152 --> 29:12.402
Now supposing this looks very plain,

29:12.694 --> 29:16.069
simple and one may say that mechanical.

29:16.610 --> 29:18.819
But if it was Shiva's job

29:19.111 --> 29:22.402
He would have done something beautiful about it.

29:24.111 --> 29:28.819
So the quality of Shiva is that He beautifies everything

29:29.485 --> 29:33.069
that is created by Brahmadeva,

29:33.902 --> 29:37.069
evolved by Vishnu.

29:37.652 --> 29:40.694
He's the one who does

29:41.027 --> 29:44.069
the subtle work of creating aesthetics.

29:44.527 --> 29:46.569
You've seen My photographs many a times

29:46.902 --> 29:51.111
with so many lights, this, that - is all His job.

29:51.443 --> 29:52.819
He's doing it.

29:53.151 --> 29:55.819
He throws lights in such a manner,

29:56.402 --> 29:58.694
He works out in such a manner.

29:59.111 --> 30:01.861
Just He wants to convince you about Me.

30:02.402 --> 30:03.694
It's His job.

30:03.986 --> 30:07.694
So His job is to create aesthetics:

30:09.569 --> 30:12.193
aesthetics of behavior,

30:13.069 --> 30:17.069
aesthetics of poetry.

30:19.902 --> 30:24.318
Everything that is created is made beautiful,

30:25.151 --> 30:29.569
is joy-giving, by Shiva - that's His quality.

30:32.485 --> 30:34.318
So whatever you desire,

30:34.610 --> 30:38.027
if you start working it out,

30:40.360 --> 30:46.360
desiring for something aesthetically handmade, nice thing,

30:50.777 --> 30:52.944
gradually you'll find

30:53.318 --> 30:55.694
you'll end up with vibrations,

30:56.193 --> 30:59.652
because all beautiful things have vibrations.

31:01.944 --> 31:03.485
And to have the vibrations

31:03.819 --> 31:06.944
you'll have to go to pure desire.

31:08.569 --> 31:11.360
So this desire which is madness,

31:11.777 --> 31:14.027
which makes you mad,

31:14.443 --> 31:20.027
which is so much dull and boring

31:21.443 --> 31:25.902
becomes pure desire, because you have to dissolve

31:26.277 --> 31:28.443
all your desires into vibration.

31:28.694 --> 31:32.652
You start desiring nothing but vibrations after some time.

31:34.861 --> 31:37.861
You'll not buy anything which has no vibrations.

31:38.318 --> 31:41.443
You'll not talk to a person who has no vibrations.

31:42.193 --> 31:45.777
If somebody has [no] vibrations you'll just run away.

31:52.027 --> 31:55.069
I've seen people running away

31:55.402 --> 31:57.152
from some people

31:57.443 --> 32:01.610
as if some monkey is after them.

32:01.902 --> 32:03.027
When I look around,

32:03.318 --> 32:04.902
I find there are people who are drunkard,

32:05.152 --> 32:07.402
or somebody coming or something.

32:07.861 --> 32:11.027
They might have been drunkard themselves once upon a time,

32:11.527 --> 32:12.735
but now they run away,

32:13.069 --> 32:17.111
"No, no, no, no. Not so now. Now no, no more."

32:19.193 --> 32:21.610
We had three, four hippies to begin

32:21.986 --> 32:24.069
with who came with Me to India.

32:24.318 --> 32:26.193
They're normal like you, they were become,

32:26.527 --> 32:28.151
you see, Sahaja yogis.

32:28.443 --> 32:32.360
And four, five hippies came to My program,

32:32.694 --> 32:34.652
it was in Rahuri, I think.

32:35.027 --> 32:39.318
They got a fright of their life, "Oh no, oh, God!"

32:39.569 --> 32:41.027
I said, "What's the matter with you?

32:41.235 --> 32:42.944
Why are you so frightened?"

32:43.235 --> 32:45.193
So I turned round to see these hippies,

32:45.485 --> 32:48.443
and by the time I'd turned round they were out.

32:49.569 --> 32:52.069
They were no more there.

32:53.902 --> 32:58.777
So then what happens, all desire ends up into chaitanya,

32:59.360 --> 33:01.485
into vibrations.

33:01.777 --> 33:02.861
And if it does not,

33:03.152 --> 33:05.318
then you must know there's something still missing.

33:05.652 --> 33:08.610
But if you do not do this,

33:09.777 --> 33:13.111
then you end up into your destruction.

33:14.318 --> 33:17.944
So to say that He's a destroyer

33:18.277 --> 33:22.652
is a very one-sided statement.

33:24.861 --> 33:27.152
He has both the powers.

33:27.610 --> 33:31.360
He has the power to give you vibrations.

33:32.111 --> 33:34.944
He gives you vibrations.

33:39.152 --> 33:43.277
The Goddess is the power, Shakti,

33:44.152 --> 33:46.069
but He makes the vibrations.

33:46.277 --> 33:49.193
It's like these are the fingers, all right,

33:50.111 --> 33:54.193
but if they tickle you then it's Shiva.

33:57.610 --> 34:00.069
The fingers are that of the Goddess, all right,

34:00.318 --> 34:04.152
but if it tickles, you know, gives you joy,

34:04.527 --> 34:09.111
happiness, it's Shiva, is the bhakti.

34:10.402 --> 34:14.152
The joy of bhakti comes from Shiva.

34:16.277 --> 34:18.944
Today only I was explaining

34:19.277 --> 34:22.402
how one lady who was a Devi bhakt

34:22.944 --> 34:25.569
and has done so much study of bhakti

34:25.902 --> 34:27.902
and all that and knew so much,

34:28.152 --> 34:32.360
just merged into Me.

34:32.402 --> 34:35.277
I just couldn't understand her how, what she has done,

34:35.777 --> 34:37.402
because normally people don't do.

34:37.652 --> 34:39.527
When they are reading about Devi they think,

34:39.777 --> 34:41.318
"All right, this is Devi, this is Mataji."

34:41.569 --> 34:43.443
You see, it's separate things.

34:43.694 --> 34:46.902
They don't know they are reading about Devi.

34:48.443 --> 34:50.777
So she said, "Mother, I just identified.

34:51.111 --> 34:54.027
It's written that how You are gentle,

34:54.402 --> 34:57.027
the Goddess is gentle, how She touches me,

34:57.402 --> 34:59.111
how She looks after me,

34:59.402 --> 35:01.777
how Her attention is on me."

35:02.193 --> 35:05.902
Like there's a sentence "kataksha, kataksha, nirikshana:

35:06.151 --> 35:08.527
every glance is an inspection."

35:08.902 --> 35:10.777
But "inspection" not a very good word,

35:11.111 --> 35:14.652
but "nirikshana" means inspection, divine inspection.

35:17.277 --> 35:19.652
"So all the time I feel that it's You, You,

35:19.986 --> 35:23.402
You are all the time - when I listen to music

35:23.735 --> 35:26.819
I feel now, see, She is looking at me,

35:27.235 --> 35:30.735
She is feeling me, She is nourishing me.

35:31.277 --> 35:34.527
All the time I feel Your love."

35:36.610 --> 35:38.861
That's how the bhakti comes in.

35:39.277 --> 35:40.610
So if you have vibrations

35:40.986 --> 35:45.193
that doesn't mean that they are something dry, you see?

35:46.443 --> 35:48.527
No,

35:48.861 --> 35:52.861
it means the joy of bhakti.

35:55.527 --> 35:59.111
Bhakti is, you can call it adoration, this, that.

35:59.402 --> 36:04.443
It's the ocean of love that is God.

36:05.443 --> 36:07.151
You just get drenched into it.

36:07.443 --> 36:09.902
There's no words to it.

36:14.151 --> 36:16.111
And that is what when you feel,

36:16.318 --> 36:18.694
you must know that

36:19.402 --> 36:23.402
you have taken the spirit

36:24.861 --> 36:28.986
as a real connection

36:30.402 --> 36:33.652
between you and your Mother,

36:34.777 --> 36:37.318
or your Father.

36:39.277 --> 36:44.777
There's no differentiation.

36:47.193 --> 36:50.527
You are one

36:50.777 --> 36:53.527
in that ocean, drenched in the ocean.

36:53.902 --> 36:56.569
You are the drop, you are the ocean.

36:57.111 --> 37:00.151
You are one in that bhakti.

37:01.151 --> 37:05.151
And that bhakti cannot be mechanical,

37:08.443 --> 37:11.193
because not man-made.

37:14.527 --> 37:19.151
So to enjoy Sahaja Yoga

37:20.443 --> 37:24.443
you must know that it's not dry vibrations only,

37:25.111 --> 37:27.777
but is the bhakti.

37:28.610 --> 37:31.069
That is the joy

37:31.694 --> 37:33.694
of Shiva's quality,

37:34.069 --> 37:37.485
the quality of joy that He adds

37:38.152 --> 37:41.027
to our life.

37:41.694 --> 37:45.902
Everything seems to be surrounded, resounding.

37:46.152 --> 37:48.235
Same thing the joy,

37:48.569 --> 37:51.235
that "I'm loved so much by God,

37:51.652 --> 37:53.694
that God loves me,

37:54.027 --> 37:56.944
that I have a meaning in life."

37:58.443 --> 38:03.443
Then the ego drops out first of all,

38:05.027 --> 38:10.485
and also the conditionings drop out.

38:14.443 --> 38:17.443
Now the third nadi:

38:23.152 --> 38:26.152
third nadi

38:26.694 --> 38:30.610
is the nadi by which we feel attached,

38:32.610 --> 38:34.610
attached to someone.

38:34.944 --> 38:39.277
Like this is my child, this is my husband,

38:39.861 --> 38:41.986
this is my family,

38:42.277 --> 38:44.527
this is my wife,

38:45.235 --> 38:48.694
this is my father, this is my mother.

38:51.111 --> 38:54.735
In the beginning of Sahaja Yoga of everyone,

38:55.111 --> 38:58.235
when they are just the beginners,

38:58.819 --> 39:03.152
so they talk about their whole family,

39:04.402 --> 39:05.861
"My father is like this,

39:06.152 --> 39:09.111
my mother is sick, my mother's sister's brother's

39:09.402 --> 39:14.360
this, that's real, this thing, is not well."

39:15.152 --> 39:19.735
As if, you see, we all have taken a contract.

39:21.735 --> 39:24.610
What should I do?

39:26.318 --> 39:30.569
Like today somebody said that "You see,

39:31.902 --> 39:33.902
they lost their first child.

39:34.277 --> 39:36.360
First child they lost,

39:37.193 --> 39:40.069
because the child was sleeping in another room."

39:40.277 --> 39:44.111
I said, "Small children should sleep with mother,

39:44.360 --> 39:46.277
and mother must look after the children."

39:46.443 --> 39:47.819
It's simple thing - I mean,

39:48.151 --> 39:50.652
in India no mother would accept such a situation.

39:50.819 --> 39:52.485
She'll throw away the husband,

39:52.819 --> 39:56.027
say, "What's this? I have to look after the child."

39:56.360 --> 40:01.069
So I said, "Tell them that they should sleep with the child."

40:02.485 --> 40:03.819
But they don't believe in it.

40:04.069 --> 40:06.235
So all right - what can we do?

40:06.485 --> 40:09.360
Have we taken their contract that

40:09.694 --> 40:11.610
we should look after their children,

40:12.027 --> 40:15.235
even when they don't want to listen to us?

40:16.069 --> 40:22.151
So the idea is, all the time in the beginning is that

40:22.443 --> 40:26.443
"Oh Mother, I've been doing Sahaja Yoga for one month,

40:26.777 --> 40:31.569
but so far my financial condition has not improved."

40:32.569 --> 40:35.485
As if they're going to sue Me for that,

40:37.151 --> 40:40.360
as if I've let them down.

40:43.360 --> 40:45.027
But they don't want to see that

40:45.235 --> 40:47.443
you have just now come to Sahaja Yoga,

40:47.777 --> 40:50.069
or even if you have been in Sahaja Yoga for so many years,

40:50.318 --> 40:53.151
you have not been a Sahaja yogi.

40:53.569 --> 40:56.027
Something missing, you don't deserve.

40:56.318 --> 40:59.318
Something wrong with you, not with Sahaja Yoga.

40:59.777 --> 41:03.318
But they feel that Sahaja Yoga

41:03.777 --> 41:07.902
is something which has got the contract.

41:08.402 --> 41:09.652
Immediately they'll inform you,

41:09.944 --> 41:10.986
"Now somebody is sick there,

41:11.193 --> 41:13.069
somebody's somebody's somebody's somebody.

41:13.360 --> 41:18.277
Send five Sahaja yogis." For what?

41:21.402 --> 41:25.402
These attachments start working within us.

41:26.235 --> 41:28.902
Now some people I've seen

41:29.777 --> 41:33.235
are very attached to their children

41:34.027 --> 41:40.193
and they go on pampering, "Oh, my child, my child."

41:40.819 --> 41:42.193
And suddenly they discover

41:42.443 --> 41:45.986
the child is now is a devil's child.

41:47.402 --> 41:49.193
The child starts answering back,

41:49.527 --> 41:52.193
saying all kinds of things, beating the parents,

41:52.527 --> 41:55.610
misbehaving, and then they suddenly discover

41:56.069 --> 41:59.152
that "this is the child whom I have been looking after,

41:59.402 --> 42:00.485
giving so much love."

42:00.777 --> 42:02.402
And they feel even worse,

42:02.735 --> 42:06.152
because "I have done so much for my wife,

42:06.485 --> 42:07.652
and she is treating me like this."

42:07.986 --> 42:10.193
"I've done so much for my husband,

42:10.527 --> 42:11.735
and he is treating me like this."

42:12.069 --> 42:13.610
Why do you do so much?

42:13.861 --> 42:15.318
There's no need.

42:15.652 --> 42:19.735
And if you are doing it, you just do it and you forget it.

42:20.861 --> 42:22.152
I never feel that way.

42:22.527 --> 42:25.111
I know of Sahaja yogis for whom I have worked very hard,

42:25.402 --> 42:27.069
and they have gone down.

42:27.402 --> 42:28.610
Only thing if I feel anything,

42:28.902 --> 42:30.652
only God knows where will they jump?

42:30.861 --> 42:32.485
Where will they be in hell?

42:32.735 --> 42:35.485
What will happen to them? That's the only concern.

42:35.861 --> 42:37.485
Not the concern what has happened,

42:37.735 --> 42:40.151
because nothing can \happen to Me.

42:42.944 --> 42:44.986
But if they have been sinful

42:45.402 --> 42:49.861
I just get worried about their future,

42:50.235 --> 42:53.277
about their lives. That's different.

42:53.735 --> 42:56.277
So this kind of attachment that is we call in Sanskrit is

42:56.610 --> 42:59.152
"mamatva" - "this is mine, that's my child,

42:59.485 --> 43:02.610
my this thing, my that."

43:05.277 --> 43:09.152
Who are your relations are Sahaja yogis - remember this.

43:09.485 --> 43:11.235
It's a sentence you must remember,

43:11.569 --> 43:14.610
"My relations are Sahaja yogis only.

43:14.986 --> 43:19.360
And anybody who plays against Sahaja yogis,

43:19.694 --> 43:22.569
troubles Sahaja yogis - that person could be my own wife,

43:22.861 --> 43:26.402
could be my own child - is not mine."

43:27.819 --> 43:31.277
Because I'll not allow such a thing to happen.

43:31.986 --> 43:35.152
This relationship is all right till

43:35.610 --> 43:39.610
Sahaja yogis are one with each other.

43:39.944 --> 43:44.610
As soon as somebody tries to harm any other Sahaja yogi,

43:45.069 --> 43:47.151
then I'm not with that person.

43:47.360 --> 43:48.861
I've seen there are many like that,

43:49.152 --> 43:50.694
but very good Sahaja yogis.

43:51.027 --> 43:52.402
They'll never side with their wives,

43:52.694 --> 43:54.735
never side with their children,

43:55.152 --> 43:58.360
because they know if you are siding with them

43:58.694 --> 44:03.735
you are making them sinful, you're destroying them.

44:04.235 --> 44:05.819
They're worried about their ascent

44:06.151 --> 44:09.152
so they'll never allow, never allow anybody,

44:09.569 --> 44:13.151
a relation of theirs to trouble others.

44:14.819 --> 44:17.027
I have seen some children

44:17.610 --> 44:20.027
who are extremely naughty,

44:20.277 --> 44:23.152
they're very troublesome, very violent,

44:23.944 --> 44:26.152
and the parents just saying, "Mother, put them right.

44:26.485 --> 44:29.485
We leave it to You." They are to be put right.

44:29.819 --> 44:30.861
But others will say,

44:31.151 --> 44:33.610
"Oh, no, no, no, no; you see my child,

44:34.027 --> 44:37.360
he cannot do such a thing, you know."

44:39.944 --> 44:45.027
So one has to understand the discrimination part of it,

44:45.402 --> 44:49.027
that "Why am I attached?"

44:50.360 --> 44:52.151
I've given this simile many a times,

44:52.402 --> 44:54.235
like the sap of the tree rises,

44:54.569 --> 44:58.027
goes to various places of the trees, various areas,

44:58.235 --> 45:01.569
looks after the bark, looks after the branch,

45:01.861 --> 45:03.735
looks after the leaves,

45:03.986 --> 45:05.777
flowers and fruits, and comes back,

45:06.152 --> 45:09.193
or it gets evaporated. It doesn't get attached.

45:09.944 --> 45:12.193
If it gets involved into one of them

45:12.527 --> 45:13.777
the whole tree will die,

45:14.111 --> 45:17.111
and that part which

45:17.485 --> 45:22.318
is so close to the sap will also die.

45:22.610 --> 45:25.944
But sap has much more sense than we have.

45:30.819 --> 45:32.569
To them, husband's so important

45:32.819 --> 45:36.027
- I mean so many problems of husbands, wives, this, that.

45:36.318 --> 45:39.443
"My God," I sometimes think, "What is this?"

45:39.735 --> 45:42.443
That's why they used to say, "Take a sanyas"

45:42.735 --> 45:44.360
- so nobody can talk about wife,

45:44.694 --> 45:45.944
children, nothing.

45:46.152 --> 45:50.152
You have to be a sanyasi, first of all be a sanyasi.

45:50.569 --> 45:51.861
So no headache to the guru.

45:52.235 --> 45:53.610
As soon as you start talking

45:53.944 --> 45:56.569
about any one relation of yours, the guru would say,

45:56.861 --> 46:00.569
"All right, you get out. Nothing doing. No good."

46:02.986 --> 46:06.111
But in Sahaja Yoga -

46:06.402 --> 46:10.402
Sahaja Yoga has much deeper

46:11.152 --> 46:12.610
work to do.

46:12.861 --> 46:14.777
It has to penetrate into the society,

46:15.069 --> 46:17.069
into the political life, into economic life.

46:17.193 --> 46:19.151
You have to emancipate the whole world.

46:19.443 --> 46:21.694
Try to understand your responsibility.

46:23.152 --> 46:28.111
You are not only here for one ascetic ascent, no.

46:31.610 --> 46:33.610
How much wisdom you must have,

46:34.069 --> 46:35.861
how much love you must have,

46:36.402 --> 46:39.360
and how much discrimination you must have,

46:39.652 --> 46:41.318
to understand that you are chosen

46:41.652 --> 46:44.652
for the emancipation of the whole world.

46:48.527 --> 46:52.277
So now this so-called limited love,

46:52.777 --> 46:55.944
what is the solution which takes you to destruction

46:56.277 --> 46:59.402
is the unlimited love.

47:00.652 --> 47:05.861
Because Shiva is nothing but love, He's love.

47:09.318 --> 47:14.735
Love is that corrects, that nourishes,

47:16.402 --> 47:19.652
that wants your benevolence.

47:21.152 --> 47:22.861
That's what Shiva is.

47:23.152 --> 47:26.193
It wants your benevolence.

47:27.986 --> 47:31.277
It looks after your benevolence.

47:31.944 --> 47:35.986
So when

47:37.069 --> 47:42.111
you are looking after the benevolence of others with love,

47:44.986 --> 47:48.485
then the whole life changes,

47:50.735 --> 47:53.652
the whole pattern changes,

47:54.402 --> 47:56.610
and you really enjoy it because

47:56.986 --> 47:59.152
you become one with so many,

47:59.527 --> 48:02.318
concerned with so many families, so many things,

48:02.735 --> 48:07.027
so many problems of others,

48:07.485 --> 48:10.151
and you just feel you are one with so many.

48:10.485 --> 48:13.944
Now see, we are so many Sahaja yogis here today.

48:14.402 --> 48:17.027
First time when I came to Italy,

48:17.235 --> 48:19.861
I must tell you,

48:20.485 --> 48:23.485
I came with Christine - no,

48:23.819 --> 48:27.360
what's the name of Gregoire's wife? Catherine.

48:27.902 --> 48:30.819
And she was the only one who knew Italian.

48:31.193 --> 48:33.027
And we had told some newspaper

48:33.360 --> 48:36.569
to reserve some sort of a hall and advertise for us.

48:36.902 --> 48:38.360
Nothing was done.

48:38.694 --> 48:41.569
So when we came we couldn't find anyone.

48:41.944 --> 48:45.151
So I went round with her to put the posters,

48:45.485 --> 48:48.193
but still nobody came.

48:48.777 --> 48:51.069
And today we are so many.

48:51.443 --> 48:55.777
But we must know that we are bound to each other by love,

48:59.027 --> 49:04.485
and the love that is for our benevolence, for our ascent.

49:06.569 --> 49:10.777
And then you just start enjoying everyone.

49:11.944 --> 49:14.235
And then you don't think what race you are,

49:14.485 --> 49:16.485
what country you are, what this thing you are,

49:16.735 --> 49:18.819
nothing - a Sahaja yogi, finished!

49:19.151 --> 49:22.735
So you become a universal being.

49:23.944 --> 49:26.694
And this attitude has to be achieved.

49:27.151 --> 49:29.277
When I hear that some Indian girls

49:29.694 --> 49:33.610
are tortured and troubled, I think, "How can they do it?"

49:34.069 --> 49:38.152
Or somebody who has a black skin, they are tortured;

49:38.652 --> 49:41.318
or some Indians are treating somebody

49:41.735 --> 49:43.861
because they are of low caste.

49:44.193 --> 49:45.986
It's not possible,

49:46.277 --> 49:49.193
because they are all part and parcel of one body.

49:49.527 --> 49:54.443
They're all brothers and sisters, born of the same Mother.

49:55.152 --> 49:57.318
But this is only possible

49:57.735 --> 50:01.610
when you dissolve that limited relationship of yours

50:01.986 --> 50:04.777
into this great unlimited ocean of love;

50:05.152 --> 50:07.152
then only it is possible.

50:07.610 --> 50:10.402
And if it is not there, do not try to justify

50:10.777 --> 50:13.152
- just watch yourself.

50:13.944 --> 50:19.193
See for yourself: are you really in love with everyone?

50:20.735 --> 50:24.610
You see, I would say that

50:25.735 --> 50:28.485
all the time when I - sometimes I go for shopping,

50:28.735 --> 50:32.111
I just think, "Oh, this one would be nice for this one,

50:32.402 --> 50:34.861
that will be nice for that one."

50:35.152 --> 50:37.069
For Myself if you say,

50:37.402 --> 50:39.777
it's impossible for Me to buy anything for Myself,

50:40.069 --> 50:43.485
impossible situation.

50:45.152 --> 50:47.777
Unless and until it is absolutely immediate,

50:48.402 --> 50:52.069
or some problem is there if I am just without it.

50:52.360 --> 50:55.111
I won't even buy a drink for Myself,

50:55.360 --> 50:56.819
even if I am thirsty.

50:57.193 --> 51:00.151
Because the whole thing is the joy of others.

51:00.527 --> 51:03.111
"Oh, this will be nice for that person.

51:03.235 --> 51:05.986
This will be good for that person."

51:10.151 --> 51:14.902
All this is the most enjoyable thing.

51:15.151 --> 51:18.235
I mean, why all this is for there?

51:18.694 --> 51:20.443
After all, think about yourself,

51:20.819 --> 51:23.694
"Why am I here?

51:26.111 --> 51:29.652
I'm here to enjoy everyone - everyone.

51:30.193 --> 51:33.027
They are all realized souls,

51:33.694 --> 51:36.902
such beautiful lotuses.

51:37.652 --> 51:41.527
I'm not going to stoop down to the mud.

51:41.902 --> 51:44.902
Now I am a lotus."

51:47.777 --> 51:53.235
That is the way you open the heart,

51:55.443 --> 51:58.111
the lotus of your heart.

51:58.443 --> 52:03.151
And the fragrance of such a person is so beautiful,

52:04.360 --> 52:08.694
is so beautiful.

52:10.694 --> 52:13.235
So you are no more divisive,

52:13.652 --> 52:15.986
you do not want to separate from each other.

52:16.235 --> 52:20.569
Anywhere is done, you are agreeable to that;

52:20.902 --> 52:22.694
you don't think that it should be done here

52:23.027 --> 52:25.111
or there or there, but anywhere

52:25.318 --> 52:29.902
- but should be all of us together.

52:31.527 --> 52:36.111
So the small attachments that are with you

52:36.902 --> 52:40.360
have to be dissolved into this ocean of love,

52:40.694 --> 52:44.193
which is Shiva.

52:49.944 --> 52:53.235
Fourth one is the most important

52:53.777 --> 52:56.027
for all of us is to know

52:56.360 --> 53:00.235
that there's a nadi which passes through left Vishuddhi

53:01.610 --> 53:03.443
into the heart.

53:03.694 --> 53:07.027
Starts from the heart, goes up,

53:07.819 --> 53:09.902
passes through Agnya.

53:10.235 --> 53:13.944
It has four petals, and opens up.

53:18.944 --> 53:22.027
This is the one which gives

53:22.652 --> 53:26.443
you the state which is called as turya.

53:26.819 --> 53:30.902
We live in three states.

53:31.193 --> 53:34.694
In the living - in the awakened state,

53:35.027 --> 53:39.111
jagruti, our attention goes to this, that, and all that;

53:39.318 --> 53:41.902
we spoil our attention.

53:44.443 --> 53:48.777
But the second one is the one what we call

53:49.111 --> 53:50.819
is that we sleep.

53:51.027 --> 53:54.777
When we sleep also

53:55.735 --> 53:57.277
all these things that have happened

53:57.569 --> 54:00.443
come to us from our past and things like that.

54:02.569 --> 54:06.443
But then we go to the deeper sleep called as sushupti.

54:08.111 --> 54:11.652
Is a state where

54:12.569 --> 54:14.902
you have deep sleep,

54:15.193 --> 54:18.986
and you dream of something that is reality also.

54:19.986 --> 54:23.111
You may dream about Me.

54:23.986 --> 54:28.193
Like it's the ethereal part of the subconscious,

54:28.652 --> 54:32.861
where some beautiful

54:33.193 --> 54:34.902
informations are passed on.

54:35.152 --> 54:37.402
Supposing I've come, say, to Italy.

54:37.652 --> 54:39.527
Italians might know in their sushupti

54:39.861 --> 54:42.318
that I have come here, or maybe anybody might know

54:42.652 --> 54:44.318
- depends on.

54:44.652 --> 54:46.527
But the fourth state is called as turya.

54:46.777 --> 54:48.111
There are two more states.

54:48.402 --> 54:50.277
You are in the turya state, it's the fourth,

54:50.610 --> 54:52.318
"turya" means fourth.

54:52.735 --> 54:56.402
Fourth state is where that you are

54:56.777 --> 54:59.861
in a thoughtless awareness state.

55:01.485 --> 55:06.318
When there is no thought - just think of it

55:07.318 --> 55:11.402
- when there is no thought, you have to be innocent.

55:12.277 --> 55:16.777
When there is no thought, you have to have vibrations.

55:17.735 --> 55:21.652
When there is no thought, you cannot be attached to anyone.

55:22.652 --> 55:25.069
So into that thoughtless state you have come now,

55:25.318 --> 55:26.986
is the "turya sthiti."

55:27.277 --> 55:30.986
And in this state when you are,

55:32.777 --> 55:37.069
these four petals which are within you

55:37.610 --> 55:41.402
have to open out in your brain.

55:43.111 --> 55:46.610
They come from your heart to your brain.

55:49.861 --> 55:54.777
And that is when

55:57.277 --> 56:02.986
you absolutely understand what is God,

56:08.069 --> 56:12.902
absolutely you know what is God is.

56:14.986 --> 56:19.360
That is the time when

56:22.193 --> 56:26.443
one receives the real knowledge.

56:32.986 --> 56:36.027
But unless and until these four petals open,

56:36.318 --> 56:38.151
one may fall back,

56:38.569 --> 56:41.235
and that's why some of the Sahaja yogis

56:41.694 --> 56:46.235
who are still meddling with things

56:46.777 --> 56:49.986
that they should not do, go down.

56:50.652 --> 56:55.360
And they don't understand what is God is.

56:57.151 --> 56:59.193
But it's not the understanding

56:59.527 --> 57:01.360
- in a way you understand this one little point,

57:01.777 --> 57:05.569
that it comes from your heart into your brain,

57:06.111 --> 57:09.527
not from brain to your heart.

57:11.902 --> 57:14.819
It comes

57:15.193 --> 57:18.443
as if the ambrosia of

57:18.735 --> 57:22.986
your bhakti covers your brain, absolutely.

57:25.610 --> 57:26.735
Say for example,

57:26.986 --> 57:30.069
Shankaracharya wrote a beautiful treatise

57:30.360 --> 57:31.694
called as "Viveka Chudamani"

57:31.986 --> 57:34.610
where he described what is God, this, that;

57:34.861 --> 57:37.360
and "viveka" means the conscience,

57:37.735 --> 57:41.485
and consciousness and all that he described quite a lot.

57:42.861 --> 57:45.069
But there was one horrible fellow called Sarma

57:45.318 --> 57:48.527
who started arguing with him and he got fed up,

57:48.861 --> 57:50.277
Shankaracharya.

57:50.569 --> 57:52.861
He said, "No use talking to them."

57:53.111 --> 57:55.986
So he just wrote "Saundarya Lahari."

57:56.318 --> 57:59.151
"Saundarya Lahari" is nothing but all the mantras

57:59.360 --> 58:00.193
praising the Mother.

58:00.527 --> 58:02.819
He said, "Why, I know Mother, now let me praise Her.

58:03.111 --> 58:06.694
Nothing doing - what's the use of talking to these people?

58:07.151 --> 58:09.235
Stupid things, how will they understand?"

58:09.652 --> 58:14.151
He realized that "These people haven't got that capacity,

58:14.443 --> 58:19.027
that sensitivity to understand what I know."

58:19.443 --> 58:24.777
That's the real knowledge, is to know what is God.

58:25.193 --> 58:27.652
And if that is God,

58:27.986 --> 58:31.193
then how can you suspect anything,

58:31.527 --> 58:34.527
how can you

58:35.485 --> 58:37.485
try to analyze anything?

58:37.777 --> 58:41.485
It's God. It's God Almighty,

58:41.944 --> 58:44.193
which knows everything,

58:44.610 --> 58:46.610
which does everything,

58:47.069 --> 58:49.777
which enjoys everything.

58:50.360 --> 58:54.152
That is the one you should say is the gyana,

58:54.485 --> 58:56.193
is the knowledge, is the true knowledge,

58:56.485 --> 58:57.610
the pure knowledge.

58:57.944 --> 59:00.152
It's not the knowledge of chakras,

59:00.527 --> 59:02.527
not the knowledge of vibrations,

59:02.986 --> 59:04.777
not the knowledge of kundalini,

59:05.111 --> 59:09.527
but the knowledge of God Almighty.

59:10.027 --> 59:13.610
And the knowledge of God Almighty is not mental.

59:13.944 --> 59:15.151
Again I tell you,

59:15.360 --> 59:19.902
it starts from your heart and goes to your brain,

59:20.694 --> 59:27.360
something that comes out of your experience of joy

59:27.777 --> 59:29.069
and covers your brain.

59:29.318 --> 59:31.944
So your brain cannot deny it any more.

59:32.235 --> 59:35.152
Like the - sometimes when you have your mother,

59:35.485 --> 59:38.610
little mother, you know the love of your mother.

59:38.944 --> 59:42.151
But you cannot explain, it comes from your heart

59:42.485 --> 59:43.902
and you say, "No, that's my mother,

59:44.151 --> 59:47.027
she won't do like that. I know my mother very well."

59:47.443 --> 59:49.151
The knowledge about your mother,

59:49.485 --> 59:51.902
the one who has given you birth;

59:52.318 --> 59:55.777
may not be, mother may not be very good or whatever it is.

59:56.151 --> 59:58.485
But knowledge about God,

59:58.902 --> 01:00:01.069
that He's love, that He's truth,

01:00:01.443 --> 01:00:03.193
that He knows everything,

01:00:03.569 --> 01:00:08.694
that just become part and parcel of your being, absolutely,

01:00:09.027 --> 01:00:13.652
and that's the time we say is the nirvana.

01:00:15.652 --> 01:00:17.443
So it's important,

01:00:17.777 --> 01:00:20.694
specially for the people of the West,

01:00:21.027 --> 01:00:23.151
now open your hearts,

01:00:23.443 --> 01:00:27.569
because it starts from the heart, not from your brain.

01:00:31.944 --> 01:00:34.443
Do not judge people on vibrations.

01:00:34.777 --> 01:00:38.318
Judge yourself, all the time.

01:00:38.777 --> 01:00:43.777
I had told that Shiva Puja means more explanation,

01:00:44.027 --> 01:00:46.069
more understanding, more this thing;

01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:52.235
because in other pujas we do all these mantras, this, that,

01:00:53.902 --> 01:00:59.152
but in this puja is to know the knowledge,

01:00:59.610 --> 01:01:02.443
it's God.

01:01:02.902 --> 01:01:06.902
And to know that you know God itself is so great.

01:01:09.402 --> 01:01:12.735
Whatever it is - She may be Mahamaya,

01:01:12.986 --> 01:01:16.402
She may be anything, but I know Her.

01:01:16.902 --> 01:01:18.527
It cannot be described in one book,

01:01:18.777 --> 01:01:21.443
it cannot be described in hundred books.

01:01:21.902 --> 01:01:24.861
It cannot be described in words,

01:01:25.193 --> 01:01:29.777
but to know that's God - after all, that's God,

01:01:30.277 --> 01:01:33.069
God Almighty.

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:38.151
And that gives you

01:01:38.443 --> 01:01:42.027
that beautiful surrender,

01:01:42.443 --> 01:01:46.235
where you just feel absolutely secured

01:01:48.694 --> 01:01:51.694
in that ocean of love.

01:01:52.485 --> 01:01:55.152
I wish you all to achieve that state.

01:01:56.152 --> 01:01:59.610
May God bless you.
