1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And then I'm just going to switch my video off and mute myself.

2
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Yeah, please take it away, Anna.

3
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Okay, before we start, can we give a collective bandhan since we're all together here for the war in...

4
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So Caroline, thank you for asking me again to come. And like I said before, I'm not a great speaker, you know, but I'll try my best.

5
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Also, I hope that whatever I share with you, this will be...

6
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Will be pleasing to Sri Mataji and her divinity, because we're all yogis, we're all connected to her.

7
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
We are yogis because of her, because of her blessings.

8
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:28.000
So I hope that whatever I share will be pleasing to her, and that you all will find it inspiring.

9
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
So many of the things that I'm going to speak about...

10
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.000
First, I'm going to talk about these three incredible miracles, because they are incredible.

11
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And then I'm going to just speak a little bit about the many of the different programs that we have, the public programs.

12
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000
And I just wanted to let you know that these public programs was not just me.

13
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Some of them I did organize, some of them, but most of them, actually all of them, they had the contribution of so many wonderful people.

14
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And actually all of them, they had the contribution of so many wonderful yogis, you know, from America and from Europe.

15
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
So we'll discuss that later.

16
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:27.000
But I wanted to finish with the miracles, because I think that you will all be astounded at these.

17
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
The one that I really, I really was going to share the last time I started, and you know, we never have enough time.

18
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And by the way, Caroline, you know, whenever I'm getting too long, just let me know.

19
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I'll shorten whatever I'm saying, because I don't want to go overboard.

20
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I don't want to be too long.

21
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So whenever I'm getting to the point where you think it's over, just let me know.

22
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
But Anna, I would, but last time it was just the joy to listen to you.

23
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
OK. But anyway, just let me know.

24
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And also, you guys, you know, you can ask questions, you can cut in.

25
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.000
You don't have to be silent if you have any questions about anything. Just speak up, you know.

26
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
So that would be great if you do have any questions.

27
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:29.000
But three beautiful things that I think you guys will just be astounded at how divine our mother is.

28
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
You know, like I said last time, I always wanted to know who is God?

29
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
You know, who is God? What is God?

30
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
You know, what is what just what is it? What kind of state is it?

31
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000
And the one which I really love, I love all of them.

32
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:56.000
But the one I want to share first is was in Los Angeles was to 2006.

33
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
And I think it was Guru Pooja.

34
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:09.000
I think it was Guru Pooja. We were in L.A. and I sat down for meditation before the pooch was going to start.

35
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Everybody was sitting down, meditating and getting ready.

36
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:19.000
And a certain point of us who came up and said, I might need you later on because we can't find Dorothy.

37
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Dorothy is one of our yoginis from Philadelphia.

38
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
And she was supposed to do something with the gifts and they couldn't find her.

39
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.000
So Vasu came up to me and said, if we can't find Dorothy, can you come and help?

40
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:44.000
I said, of course, you know. So towards the end of the poocha, he did call me and he said, come, come up, you know, behind the stage.

41
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:53.000
And I went behind the stage and there were, you know, gifts that are actually gifts that are already been given on the stage.

42
00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:04.000
There were just a few left and the yogis that were on the stage were already finishing up giving the gifts and putting them away.

43
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.000
So basically, you know, I was just standing there and I really didn't want to go back.

44
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.000
I just want I was going to wait for Shrimati to leave so I could just see her close up.

45
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:28.000
And so I waited and when they prepared Shrimati to leave, they closed the curtain, of course, to the stage.

46
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:39.000
So I was behind the curtain and just was watching Manoj, the leader at that time, wheeling Shrimati down the ramp.

47
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:51.000
And as Manoj is coming down, gently pushing the wheelchair, I look at Shrimati and she looks like a little old lady to me.

48
00:05:51.000 --> 00:06:02.000
She was she looked sick. And her head was bent down towards her right side and it was touching her left, her right shoulder.

49
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:19.000
And because she looked like so tired. And and then as Manoj passed me, I'm looking at Shrimati from behind and I see her right shoulder kind of slumped down.

50
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And her head bent down as if she she was really, really tired, but I couldn't see her face.

51
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:39.000
I could just see her body like very old and very, very tired. And, you know, just like I just like a little old lady.

52
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:48.000
To me, she looked like a little old sick lady. And then as I was watching her, I said to myself, Shrimati, you're not this little lady.

53
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.000
I know you're not. I know you're not this little old sick lady.

54
00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:07.000
And then Manoj pushed Shrimati's wheelchair and they left the the the they left that entrance of the hotel.

55
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:18.000
And so I was left standing there still thinking, you know, Rauchi Makuji looked and thinking, I know mother is not that little old lady.

56
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:28.000
And right at that moment. I started feeling these incredible vibrations and I had to look up.

57
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Something told me to look up and I looked up at the curtain.

58
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:40.000
The curtains were like like a grayish white or, you know, like very light gray, almost like off white.

59
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:54.000
I looked up and I see these incredible white vibrations. And then what started forming in the vibrations was the face of the goddess.

60
00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:09.000
It was if you could have seen the face of the goddess, it was incredible. Shrimati's eyes looked into eternity.

61
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:22.000
And she was young. You can put an age on her, but she was like pure youth, you know, pure young youth, young woman.

62
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:29.000
And her face was looking into eternity and she was so beautiful.

63
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:36.000
And I'm just astounded at the image that she presented to me.

64
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:45.000
And then slowly, slowly it kind of the vibrations kind of dissipated and the image kind of stopped.

65
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
The image, you know, was was it stopped.

66
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:57.000
And so I started looking down. The vibrations were getting they were getting weaker and weaker.

67
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:07.000
And then I was like so full of surprise and still full of vibrations myself that I wanted to go and talk to somebody and tell them.

68
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000
And I and I saw Jerry Maflow. You might even be listening now.

69
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:21.000
And I went up to him and I'm saying, Jerry, and I'm going, blah, blah, blah. I couldn't talk. I could not talk.

70
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:28.000
It was so that the experience was so powerful that I just could not talk.

71
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:36.000
And then I tried talking to his father in law. Trying again, attempting to explain what I just saw.

72
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:45.000
And it just it wouldn't come out. I just couldn't talk. So what I did, I just finally sat down on the ground.

73
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:53.000
I sit on the floor against the wall and I just close my eyes and I just, you know, relax.

74
00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:05.000
What about what I just seen that was just so powerful and just amazed that, you know, that the Shama Teji, you know, allowed me to experience that.

75
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:15.000
And, you know, so Mother is not a little lady. We know she's the Adishakti, but, you know, to what extent.

76
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:21.000
She's the Adishakti. And she really gave me such a blessing that time.

77
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:28.000
So whenever we think of Mother as, you know, in her human form, it's just Maya.

78
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:36.000
It's all illusion. And hopefully one day we will see the full picture.

79
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:42.000
And the other one, another miracle, which I really wanted to share with you.

80
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:48.000
One minute.

81
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
And this was.

82
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:56.000
When Mother left her holy body, I went to Kibella.

83
00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.000
And there were many yogis there, there were probably about three, four hundred yogis.

84
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:08.000
And we are waiting for the yogis from.

85
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Genoa to bring down the, you know, Shama Teji's holy body.

86
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:20.000
And there, as the car arrived, the first car, of course, was Mother's.

87
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:27.000
And it opened up and Cerce came out from the front part.

88
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
And then the yogis took the coffin out of the car.

89
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:46.000
And then there were about eight yogis that started bringing Shama Teji upstairs towards Kibella, towards the dining room or towards her apartment.

90
00:11:46.000 --> 00:12:01.000
And as she's looking up and as they're bringing her up the stairs very, very slowly, very carefully, you know, what came into my mind was all of the past experiences of I had.

91
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
I had.

92
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Experience during my time with her.

93
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:15.000
But, you know, with the physical body and in me, just like everybody else, you know.

94
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
We were all so emotional and I just started crying.

95
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:27.000
And then I said to myself, as I was looking up, the yogis were carrying the coffin.

96
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Slowly, you know, in step in coordination.

97
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
And I'm thinking, Mother, did I, did I.

98
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Was I worthy of you?

99
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
You know, because I.

100
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Just like everybody else, we were all so emotional. And I said, Mother, I hope I was worthy of you and and I hope that I didn't make any mistakes.

101
00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:11.000
I know I made mistakes. I know that, you know, I made so many mistakes. But I said, I just hope that I didn't neglect my family and I didn't neglect anything that you want to be to do.

102
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
And so I said, Mother.

103
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Did I do everything that you want me to do?

104
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:28.000
You know, that I behaved well with my family, because many times, you know, I would just go to programs and leave my family alone.

105
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:37.000
And I was thinking back and I just kind of felt kind of guilty. But, you know, it was Mother's work and I had to do it.

106
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
And.

107
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:46.000
And so they were almost reaching the top of the stairs into the salon.

108
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
And then I started feeling these.

109
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000
I thought I felt the fly here on my forehead, on my right forehead.

110
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Right side of my forehead. I thought I felt the fly and I'm going like this.

111
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000
And then again, I started feeling this like tingling.

112
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:13.000
And then I heard Shama's voice and she just said very gently, she said, yes.

113
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
And it was like.

114
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000
You know, we were all in the state of.

115
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Sadness.

116
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:32.000
You know, the emotions were very, very high, very deep and and and I guess my emotions were like that also.

117
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
But I just I just.

118
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:43.000
I just wanted to tell Shama that I just hope she was pleased with me.

119
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:49.000
And then I finally heard her voice just was on the side of my head on the right side.

120
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
I heard such a sweet, gentle yes.

121
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000
And then I just everything just released, you know.

122
00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:07.000
Not the moment, you know, where you're watching Shama Teji's last moments on earth in the coffin.

123
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:15.000
You know, anything gets released. But it was I was just so.

124
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Content. That you know that that.

125
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:29.000
The fact that I had sometimes neglected my son, my family, my husband, and that kind of put me at ease, you know.

126
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:36.000
So anyway, mother knows everything. She knows everything.

127
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:45.000
And, you know, like she always says, if our desire is pure, she will manifest that.

128
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000
And anyway.

129
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
The other one, the last miracle that I wanted to show.

130
00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Was still in the beginning. It was 1989, actually, I was going through a pretty bad divorce and I was really I was going to leave New York.

131
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:15.000
And I was in such a state of turmoil, you know, I mean, I mean, I loved my husband, but I had to divorce otherwise.

132
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
We would have affected me too much. It was already affecting me.

133
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
And but I knew I had to cut it and I didn't want to, but I had to.

134
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:32.000
So, you know, I left New York and I was making my way to Ohio because my family was in Ohio.

135
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:40.000
And my heart was like, you know, almost bursting out of my chest because everything was so heavy.

136
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Everything was so tense, you know, and I knew I was going through a really, really, really bad time.

137
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:55.000
So I'm getting I was I took the bus. I was waiting in line for the bus. Take me to Cleveland.

138
00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:03.000
And I have like three or four suitcases with me and I'm pushing them one by one.

139
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
And then all of a sudden I hear this.

140
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:11.000
Like like some kind of a wind. I had no idea where I came from.

141
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000
I looked around. I didn't see anything. I didn't.

142
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000
They were just people in front of me that were reading together the bus.

143
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:26.000
But I didn't see anything. And so I said, well, you know, it could have been the wind or something.

144
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000
And then I went to get my suitcases and then I hear a voice.

145
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:37.000
It's a male voice. And he said, can I help you?

146
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.000
And I looked around and I see this man.

147
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:50.000
He looked OK. You know, he looked fine. He didn't look like mean or, you know, violent or anything.

148
00:17:50.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Yeah, sure. Because I like three or four suitcases. And so I took one or two suitcases and he's picking up the others.

149
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:10.000
And we're slowly, slowly moving. And he said to me. Are you going to Phoenix?

150
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:16.000
So, no, you know, I'm not. I'm going to Cleveland. You see the sign up there?

151
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:28.000
Remember, see, see the sign up there. And so we're the line is moving towards the getting on the bus.

152
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:35.000
So we moved the suitcases up a little bit forward. And then he said, are you going to Los Angeles?

153
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:42.000
What? I'm not going to Los Angeles. I told you I'm going to Cleveland.

154
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:51.000
And then we reached almost the front part of where the conductor was taking the tickets.

155
00:18:51.000 --> 00:19:00.000
And. We're right in front of him. And I don't know what happened to this person.

156
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:08.000
He actually would be the way you look like he was blond. You know, he was like kind of kind of stocky.

157
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000
He wasn't tall, but he was stocky and he was round and he was blondish.

158
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:23.000
He was kind of a little bit bald up here. And but his hair was blond, not great, but just blondish.

159
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000
And he was just very stocky and some kind of a white shirt on.

160
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:38.000
And so to get so. But before we reach the man, the conductor, once more, he said to me, are you going to Los Angeles?

161
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:47.000
And I said, no, I told you I'm going to Cleveland. And by this time, I'm thinking, you know, what's going on with this guy?

162
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:57.000
You know, I you know, I thought he was just a strange guy and I was going to be on the bus and I was going to be a pain in the ass and just forget this guy.

163
00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:04.000
So we reached the we were by the conductor's taking the tickets and I'm going to hand in my ticket.

164
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:13.000
But this but the man that is following me is next to me and he gives him his ticket.

165
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:20.000
And the conductor opens up the ticket and he looks at the ticket and he said, hey, there's nothing here.

166
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:26.000
It was just a piece of paper. And at that moment, the man ran away.

167
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:35.000
I'm thinking. What is going on? You know, and he just took off when the conductor opened up his ticket, there was nothing there.

168
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:41.000
And he just at the moment, he's like she's like ran so quickly, like almost like a like a cat.

169
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:47.000
You know, a cat moves. It turns in him. It wants to go. But it turns very quickly.

170
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:55.000
And then it disappears. And this is what this man did. And I thought what?

171
00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000
What's going on here? I had no idea. I think you know what?

172
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:08.000
I got I got on the bus. And I'm still in that state of, you know, emotion because you went through divorce and stuff.

173
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:16.000
And and then I started feeling so much peace.

174
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000
It was incredible. All of the tension went away. My heart opened up.

175
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000
I started feeling, you know, in the state of where I wanted to be.

176
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:36.000
And that was the state of peace, of the state of knowing that that everything was going to be fine, that you had to do you had to get this divorce.

177
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:46.000
It was needed. Otherwise, it would not have been good for you to continue. And then I thought back to that person that helped me with the suitcases.

178
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:56.000
And then I'm thinking, God, I wonder if maybe she sent him, you know, to help me, you know, but.

179
00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:07.000
I was talking to Louisa. Louisa is, you know, here. He told me that it could have been some form of William Ailaba, William Blake.

180
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:15.000
I don't know. But his body, I still remember distinctively his body. His body was stocky.

181
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:22.000
It was very stocky, round, and it was just all in white. And he had this blondish hair.

182
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
So I think maybe somebody.

183
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:40.000
It was some form of a deity that your mother just sent to kind of, you know, let me know that everything was going to be fine and that that that with time, I would you know, I would feel better.

184
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:57.000
Anyway, these couple of other things also happen, but I'm just going to stick to these three because they're so special, you know, and to share them with you only gives us, you know.

185
00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:09.000
A broader picture, a broader knowledge of where our mother is. She's the Adishakti.

186
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:18.000
You know, we're just so blessed. We're just blessed, blessed human beings.

187
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:43.000
Hopefully, we'll, you know, reach home where she wants us to be in our South Star. Remember, when she opened up my South Star, this, you know, this is where our goal, our purpose for her to, you know, to have given us self-realization was to be able to reach her.

188
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:51.000
And God, you know, and we're just, I can't stop saying how blessed we are. So,

189
00:23:51.000 --> 00:24:01.000
Anna, can I ask one question? Did you have any feeling about why he might have been asking why you're going to Los Angeles?

190
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:08.000
Well, thinking about it later, you know, Los Angeles means the City of Angels.

191
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000
Yeah, so that's all I can think of.

192
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:22.000
You know, maybe, maybe, maybe if he was a deity, and I can't say for sure, but it was some form of, you know, vibration of hope that mother sent.

193
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:29.000
And then he said Phoenix, you know, you know, Phoenix is, you know, the from the Greek mythology.

194
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:35.000
He's the bird that burns himself so he can be transformed.

195
00:24:35.000 --> 00:25:02.000
You see, so that's why I think he said Phoenix and twice that LA, because even she not that he says, Los Angeles means the City of Angels. So maybe, you know, that when doing this journey that I was starting would take me there, you know, so I don't know, I, I can't say for sure but that's, that's the only thing I can think of.

196
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
You know, right.

197
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000
Do you have any idea.

198
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000
No, no, I just wonder what you did, what you were thinking.

199
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:21.000
The only thing that can come into my mind you know so anyway there were a couple of other things that but we have to stop.

200
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:37.000
I told Carolyn that the photos that I tried finding them. I cannot, you know, I'm in the process of moving soon everything's in boxes, and I couldn't find the stuff I think Adrian has them because I either for the internal moments.

201
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:46.000
Once I get them back I will, you know, share them with you guys. There was an amazing photos from Toronto. But anyway,

202
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:53.000
the problems that we did.

203
00:25:53.000 --> 00:26:00.000
You know, once I felt not secure but once I felt ready.

204
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:14.000
I started giving public programs. After I think was 1987 I got my position in 83 and as I told you guys already, and I don't want to harp on that you know, I was in bad shape.

205
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:24.000
When I came to sahaja yoga, really really bad shape left side right side of the choppers messed up back out now. Forget it.

206
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:40.000
But it took me three four years, just working on myself, which the programs, going to the pooches and by 1987 I started having the public programs in Jackson Heights in New York, Queens, New York.

207
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000
And so until 1990.

208
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:52.000
I did the programs there and again, I was not by myself, you know, yogis were coming out that were living in Queens.

209
00:26:52.000 --> 00:27:02.000
And many years would come also from Brooklyn, Manhattan, so it wasn't me. And that was a learning experience. And then as I get stronger and stronger.

210
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000
So, 1990.

211
00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:14.000
I think I read 1989, the latter part of 1989, that they were having programs in prisons, in a Sikh in India.

212
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:28.000
And I read the report, and I said oh my god, this is fascinating you know, to give self realization to prisoners. And that, that notice just, you know, really really inspired me.

213
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000
And so, you know, here in New York we have Rikers Island.

214
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:42.000
It's like it's probably the biggest prison in America, it's a it's a holding prison. It means that people are there, they're waiting to go to try.

215
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:56.000
You know they're not guilty or innocent but they're waiting to go to trial to find out about, you know, their behavior, whether you know they're going to prison or not.

216
00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:07.000
So it was a holding prison and there was a lot. And the night I did all the paperwork I contacted people.

217
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:14.000
And we finally, you know, got a response and the thing is, at that time, she was coming to New York.

218
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:20.000
And she was giving programs for social workers.

219
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:37.000
So it worked out that I invited the her name, Maria, Maria, she was like the head of one of the men's department in the prison. It was a medical, these were prisoners who were ill.

220
00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:48.000
And she ran that and I asked, I invited her to come to Shemataji's program in Manhattan, that mother was going to get for social workers.

221
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:57.000
And she came. You know, she came and through her this was even before we did the programs we started, she came and that's why.

222
00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:04.000
Afterward, and she met mother and she had a realization through mother first, not even through the yogis but through mother.

223
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:14.000
And when we started the programs. She was incredible because she had met mother and she was so enamored and so inspired.

224
00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:21.000
And so she allowed us so many things that, you know, usually visitors aren't allowed to do.

225
00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:33.000
She allowed us for the men, we firstly worked with the men, we worked in the medical area where the prisoners needed medical attention.

226
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:42.000
And Maria Gerena, she would allow the prisoners even to putzok.

227
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.000
So they would putzok and Stella, one of our yogis.

228
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:54.000
She would even bring sandwiches and they would allow her, you know, and then again there was others doing.

229
00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:02.000
So we were allowed to do so many things that normally regular visitors were not allowed so we were given a lot of leeway.

230
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:11.000
But I remember the first program we did was me, I was Stella, I don't know if Jerry was listening.

231
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:16.000
I know that Mary and Berman came too.

232
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:22.000
And I remember we were waiting for the very first program to start.

233
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:38.000
And then these guys come in from another room and they're in shackles, you know, their hands are tied and their legs are held on shackles.

234
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:52.000
So, you know, they would like walk very slowly. And that was such a powerful moment because, you know, these guys, you know, you could see they were very poor.

235
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000
They were all ill.

236
00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:00.000
They were in a pretty bad state, all of them.

237
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.000
And there was, I remember there were about 12 to 15 men that came.

238
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:20.000
And we had the program and it was just so powerful. It was vibrations were very, very heavy, so heavy, because you know the environment, the status of the vibrations of you know the prisoners.

239
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:33.000
But at the end, when, when, you know, we give, we went, we went through the program the information chakras, and then it can go into the self realization, and at the end, everybody got it.

240
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000
It was amazing.

241
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.000
And again, mother's attention was always there.

242
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000
And my new Jana was always there.

243
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:47.000
You know, sometimes she would also participate.

244
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:57.000
So we did we did the men's part for about maybe three, four or five months. Then we went to do with the women.

245
00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:07.000
And that was amazing because when we went to do the programs with the women. There were about 70 women that came.

246
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:12.000
There was seven that 65 to 70. They were all ages they were white, black.

247
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000
I know there was some Chinese.

248
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:21.000
The majority were Hispanic and black, but there were some also some Caucasian people.

249
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:32.000
And the first program we did was amazing because they all paid attention. You know they were like all anxious to you know to, you know, to meditate.

250
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:47.000
And at the end, everybody got the realization. And at the end they all came, they all came towards. They wanted to talk to us. And we learned that most of the women were in there because of drug use.

251
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.000
Many of them were drug addicts.

252
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:58.000
And as children, they came from, you know, broken families. Many of them have been sexually abused.

253
00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:04.000
And, you know, many of them, you know, grew up with alcoholic parents and.

254
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000
But that was amazing.

255
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:17.000
With the women, and just one story I want to share about the women's program, because we did this for about three months then we went on with the teenagers, but there was one lady.

256
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000
She was pregnant. Her name was Sophia she was Greek.

257
00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:26.000
And she was a she was like, almost nine months pregnant.

258
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:31.000
And she came to like two three programs, and then we didn't see her anymore.

259
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:35.000
Then I thought maybe you know she, her baby was born you know.

260
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.000
And this is amazing. Listen to this.

261
00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:52.000
Later she came back. She had her baby. And she said she had a little boy, but she she actually took over the program. She was started talking to the women she said, you guys.

262
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000
This is for real.

263
00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.000
I was my baby was born.

264
00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000
I was, I was a drug addict.

265
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:07.000
Oh, the doctors and the prison were expecting my child to be born, addicted to drugs.

266
00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.000
She said my baby was born.

267
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000
Very cool.

268
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:19.000
He wasn't addicted, but he was very very cool. And yet when he was when he was born.

269
00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.000
Everybody around to feel the school breeze.

270
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000
Isn't it incredible.

271
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000
And, and that was amazing.

272
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:34.000
Billy's. This stuff is good you know it's for real.

273
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:48.000
And then we learned that she told me her baby's name was Richard so nobody also called always called him baby Richard. And, and then you know we stopped these programs, because we had to go on with the teens.

274
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000
But the fascinating thing happened.

275
00:34:52.000 --> 00:35:12.000
That was me or Andrea cousins you know she's in politics now. I don't know if she asked me or if I asked her to go to mother Hill house, which is a Norfolk in Harlem, where it's very famous mother.

276
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:23.000
And we both went there with the intention of asking the administration to do programs side yoga programs and.

277
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:27.000
And the person that we spoke with.

278
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:34.000
She told us that she was telling us the in what the way set up.

279
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:40.000
And she said we also even have a place here for young children for young babies.

280
00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:46.000
And we even have a, she said, we even have a baby who came from the prisons.

281
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000
My God. And also, I started feeling these migrations.

282
00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000
And I said, Is that baby Richard.

283
00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.000
He said yeah.

284
00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:02.000
And he was in the office, he said that he ended up in the orphanage because his mother went back on drugs.

285
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:13.000
And she had to put him in the orphanage and she couldn't, you know, she couldn't take care of him because she went back to drugs and she did.

286
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:31.000
So the baby was putting the orphanage but I asked to see if we could see the baby but the man the ladies have no, you know, visitors are not allowed to see the babies at all, which, of course, we respected so anyway that's you know that's something

287
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:46.000
that, you know, mother did all that you know we mean, dreable were just you know vehicles for all of these incredible experiences. And then we went to the teams and if Jerry's listening.

288
00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.000
He came to work with the teams.

289
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:58.000
And

290
00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:18.000
most of these, the way we have the first program you know if the the the the guards had been more committed, you know, more, they were, they could have brought more people down more to more teens down to participate, but you know, the guards they're there for their

291
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:32.000
money. You know, they were, they were good they were decent. I really didn't commit themselves fully to you know to our programs, and to get you know the teens down to participate.

292
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:42.000
And as a matter of fact, you know that the programs with teens, less than two three times because the guards actually did not want to even to bring them down.

293
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:53.000
You know, but we did two programs with the teens. And the first one that we did. We learned that all of these teenage boys.

294
00:37:53.000 --> 00:38:07.000
They all knew about Tai Chi. They know about Buddha, they know Jesus, then they had a lot of information on the religious background. So they weren't just, you know,

295
00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000
they were seekers.

296
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:30.000
Hold on.

297
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:35.000
I got tired from the refrigerator when I talked like, it's so dry.

298
00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:51.000
So we learned that was fascinating because these boys, you know, yeah, they were, you know, they came from four families, but they, they were all seekers they you know they want to know about Buddha they wants to know about, you know about Christ.

299
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.000
And then the program being very at the end.

300
00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:06.000
And we, there was one boy that kept. We were talking, you know, talking about the chakras, and there was one boy that kept going back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.

301
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.000
And so we got done with the introduction.

302
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:28.000
And we were meditating. And this boy finally sat down, and he meditated with us. And then, Jerry and I, we just we took the incense, we were allowed to use the incense, you know, you were kind of like doing the bond dance to clear the picture and, and to show that you

303
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:33.000
know the kids that this is just a clearing mechanism to clear the environment.

304
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:40.000
And the boy that had been walking back and forth, that eventually joined us, then he came up to us.

305
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.000
And then he took the incense, and he started doing the same thing.

306
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:56.000
And he started, you know, making the bond dance around mother's picture. And then he said to us, does this mean that she matter to you forgives me.

307
00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:02.000
And oh my God, me and Jerry were like, no, we were almost crying.

308
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:15.000
Because he automatically, you know, said this is mean that she matter to you, forgive me you know it was amazing is, and these kids were they were just, they were amazing.

309
00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:30.000
They were, they were all seekers you know, unfortunately, the, the administration didn't pursue more programs because again didn't didn't want to be bothered you know they were okay but didn't want to bother.

310
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:38.000
We did these programs for almost two years, believe it or not, it was amazing.

311
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:44.000
Bella came, Jerry, Ben, Mary Ann came.

312
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:51.000
And also, Mr. Subramyan, you know the musician, the wonderful musician from India.

313
00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.000
At one point was in New York.

314
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000
And we met.

315
00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:07.000
And anyway, he wanted to come here about our programs. And so, you know, we got permission from to come. And he, he gave a musical program.

316
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.000
And my God, and so at the end.

317
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:24.000
The operations were so amazing you know because you know Mr. Subramyan is a fascinating, such a, you know, deep deep singer, musician.

318
00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:33.000
And at the end, you know, he always reaches those notes where he was like, your Kundalini is up. And you're just so fully connected.

319
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000
And when we finished.

320
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000
You know what this last song.

321
00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000
No, we were just all amazed, we were just in meditation.

322
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:46.000
And this, these guys that were there. They were about seven or eight of them.

323
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:54.000
This one cute big guy he was Spanish. He just took Mr. Subramyan you know, and you know Subramyan is so small.

324
00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.000
And he took him and he hugged them.

325
00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000
He said man.

326
00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000
That was beautiful.

327
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:08.000
And he said, Mr. Subramyan, and it was just amazing you know. Then another time Andrea came.

328
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.000
She came.

329
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:16.000
I think this was when she was starting a political career. And she came to one of the programs and.

330
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.000
And I remember it was summertime, and it was so hot.

331
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:28.000
And, and before we started, I said that to the guard. I said you know it's kind of hot and you can't open the windows.

332
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:38.000
I mean, I didn't think that we were in prison, you know, and the guy looks at me like, lady. This is a prison we can't open the windows, you know, I said Oh my god I forgot.

333
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:43.000
But it was really really hot. And Andrea gave the program.

334
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:54.000
The vibrations were amazing. It was amazing because there were about 12 guys all fascinated with with the yoga they were all paying attention.

335
00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:00.000
And I did. Every time. Andrea will talk, this little bird would come on the window.

336
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:11.000
You know on the windowsill. And it was just amazing, you know, and as Andrea will talk and then she would address the bird and say, Oh okay you want to participate, you know, it was just beautiful.

337
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:21.000
And the men were just, you know, they, they all meditated very deeply and I know, I know that these programs in prisons.

338
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:26.000
They were amazing that, you know, mother's attention.

339
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.000
Just, just does not go on us.

340
00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:37.000
You know we're the privileged ones you know, but her attention goes on every human being.

341
00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:43.000
Whether you're rich, whether you're poor, whether you're black, whether you're white.

342
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:52.000
And I knew every time you know we did these programs I knew mother, you know was saving these people you know.

343
00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:59.000
So saving these, you know, unfortunate people. So, but there was one more story that

344
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.000
I will then remember.

345
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:06.000
There was one Hispanic young man he was about 21, 22.

346
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.000
He came to the program and he kept telling us, I'm innocent.

347
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000
He said, I'm here.

348
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.000
I'm just waiting to go to trial I've been here like two three months.

349
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:42.000
I was going to trial and I just hope they find me innocent because I had been in a gang before. But when that particular incident happened, he happened to be near it, but he wasn't involved with some kind of either a robbery or, you know, some kind of a, you know, bad behavior that the guys that was pretty bad.

350
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:52.000
But Napoleon, his name was Napoleon said, I'm innocent. So we kept telling him, Napoleon, come to the programs and he did. He came to the programs.

351
00:44:52.000 --> 00:45:02.000
And we kept telling him, when you, you just asked mother to guide you. If you are innocent and inspire patients are very cool. You would meditate all the time.

352
00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:08.000
And we said, when you meditate, just ask mother to help you.

353
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000
He will help you.

354
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:23.000
And you know what, the week before he had to go to trial he told us, he said, I'm not coming back now because I have, I'm going to be going to the trial. So maybe I won't be seeing you.

355
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:33.000
And so we just give bandanas that he would, you know, be found innocent. And the two, three days later, the big headline. You know, then the daily news.

356
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:45.000
You know, the news is a major newspaper here. And, and it said, you know, it said that Napoleon had been found innocent in a half hour.

357
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:50.000
You know, half hour into the trial. He was released.

358
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:59.000
So, I mean, that's another incredible story. And again, you know, we, we were only mother's instruments.

359
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:06.000
And, you know, mother, mother's attention goes to everyone.

360
00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:11.000
Everyone, you know, but then we get.

361
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:19.000
We have programs, we get to Gaza for three years drug rehab.

362
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:30.000
Yeah, the drug rehabs they were also incredible. The very first program we did, and seeing the thing is the lady that

363
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:42.000
gives permission to do the program she was the director of sukasa which is a drug we have in the lower reciting Manhattan, and she also met mother, you see, in that program.

364
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:54.000
When mother, he came to give realization to social workers and Denise Donovan came also and she met mother and got a realization through she might have G.

365
00:46:54.000 --> 00:47:03.000
And that's how you know we were able to start these drug programs and the very first program we did. I remember Jerry was there.

366
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:07.000
There were 89 people.

367
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:24.000
89 all waiting for us. And, you know, some of them that, you know, old clothes on some of them had dirty clothes on. I mean you can see on their faces that they were, you know that their life, you know, was not good.

368
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:29.000
It was a, you know, tense environment.

369
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.000
You know they were because you know because they were all caught up.

370
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:44.000
You know they were caught up on the left side and right side of the chakras were all, you know, in balance. And you know the environment was really heavy.

371
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:55.000
And it was really hard. You know, for the meditation. So what we did we just, you know, we did the introduction.

372
00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.000
And then we just spent a lot of time meditating.

373
00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:06.000
We just took extra time, longer than usual because the vibrations were so heavy and so

374
00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.000
tense.

375
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:15.000
You know, and so we just meditate a little bit longer with the hopes that the companies will come up, and at the end, they all got it.

376
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:33.000
At the end, something, you know something just released, and they all got it, and it was amazing. And we continue those programs for three years not, you know, not consecutively time but there were times when you know we take a week or two weeks off or no read after

377
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.000
the coaches or whatever.

378
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:39.000
But the drug programs were amazing.

379
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.000
What else.

380
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.000
What time is it?

381
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:53.000
It's 339. Yeah, I'll try. I'll try to be brief. Does anybody have any questions?

382
00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000
No.

383
00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.000
But anyway.

384
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:05.000
So we also we did programs with them again. I was never alone you know when we did the programs in prison.

385
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.000
Mother never let us alone.

386
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.000
Let us be alone with the men.

387
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:13.000
There was always a yogi or male yogi with us, always.

388
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:25.000
And, you know, she was always watching everything. And then one time. This was amazing. One time we couldn't get in. This was the prison program.

389
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:28.000
We couldn't get in. We wait like an hour.

390
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:34.000
And there was some kind of a lockdown.

391
00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:51.000
You know, nobody could be in and out so we waited an hour, an hour and a half. So finally, you know, we said, I remember Stella was with us and we said you know we just might as well leave because it's already like almost two hours we've been waiting, which might as well go and then I said,

392
00:49:51.000 --> 00:50:02.000
let's check vibrations to see, you know why we can't go in, you know, and we check the vibrations and you know what the mooladhara was so bad.

393
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:17.000
It was like, it was like, it was a horrible, you know, it was like something was going on. You know, regarding the mooladhara chakra within the prison and mother did not allow us to go in.

394
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:33.000
You see, amazing. It's just amazing how everything that that we did, not just me, but other your mother was there, guiding us, you know, and that's all the one thing you know never be afraid.

395
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:46.000
Because we, you know, you know, the prisons, they have, they've got isolation areas where you know they have murderers, they have, you know, psychopaths, but we were never allowed even to go there.

396
00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:50.000
You know the administration of course was very

397
00:50:50.000 --> 00:51:05.000
you know, we were always, you know, discriminated about that, you know, we would only see you know people that that yeah they were in prison, they were in bad shape but you know that they were not harmless and we never, nothing ever happened to us, nothing.

398
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:09.000
Oh, and one more time at the prison. This is amazing.

399
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:12.000
It really worked out something so incredible.

400
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:33.000
At one time, Maria Jarena asked me if I, how many years I could get to come to do programs. So because we want what you wanted to do was to have what have as many of us come to give realization in different of different areas of the prison with a man.

401
00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:51.000
Okay. And so I was able to like eight, there were eight of us, there was, you know, Jerry, Ben, Stella, Alan, where he came, who else, Francois came, and a couple of others I can't, I can't remember right now but there were eight of us, and each one of us was in,

402
00:51:51.000 --> 00:52:07.000
was in a different room, giving realization. So that evening, at least, at least 300, I would imagine 300, 350 prisoners got their realization was amazing.

403
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:36.000
We came out of the room flying with vibrations. It was amazing, you know, again, you know, Maria Jarena, that mother, and she, she really, you know, was the instrument for her thrust, you know, to bother and through her, you know, mother was saving so many people who were living very unfortunate lives and, you know, and hopefully they're all okay now.

404
00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:45.000
So we did the sukasa, which would be the drug rehab. Then we did three realizations for three years my God.

405
00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:48.000
When they had the very first Earth Day.

406
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:51.000
We were in Grand Central.

407
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:56.000
And as you know Grand Central is very famous it's a beautiful train station.

408
00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:05.000
And it's just a magnificent. And we organized programs for Sahaj to have a Sahaj table there.

409
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:25.000
And there was a very, very first day for Earth Day celebration, and, and me and many, many of the yogis were there. And it was amazing because it was, you know, the start of the Earth Day celebration, the attention on Mother Earth.

410
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:35.000
And so many people got the realization it was amazing. We did, we did that for like three years but mostly in the summertime because in the winter.

411
00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:47.000
The street realization companies that provided the areas, and they provided the tables that organized the street realization themselves and allowed us to participate.

412
00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:57.000
They only, you know, did it in the summertime, or the fall but when it got cold, or you know, the weather was bad they would, but we did it for three years in the summertime goes.

413
00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:04.000
That was amazing and so many people, so many people would just get the realization.

414
00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:11.000
As the last thing I wanted to share is.

415
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:14.000
Yeah, the Native Americans.

416
00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:20.000
Because it's getting to be like 345. I'll be very brief.

417
00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:23.000
I know a lot of you want to be here but you have American program.

418
00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:37.000
The starting is I had read a book called bury my heart and wounded me, which if you guys haven't read it. I would suggest that you read it because it's just a, it's very enlightening for a yogi.

419
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:43.000
It's very enlightening to realize the depth.

420
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:57.000
What actually happened in this country, or the genocide that was created against, you know, a very very innocent race. So I read the book, and I read like two days and I was amazed.

421
00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.000
I said I got out of it.

422
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:03.000
I stopped by finished reading it and I said oh my god.

423
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:24.000
I said oh my god we have so much work to do because the this book, really, I gave you the history of the systemic the systemic organizational area of how everything was organized to

424
00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:28.000
kill the Indians.

425
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:41.000
This book gives you a history of how each of the attacks that were committed, where they, they were, you know,

426
00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:45.000
at night, they would go into a village, they will kill babies.

427
00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:51.000
Women, they would rape the women mean the atrocious things that they will do.

428
00:55:51.000 --> 00:56:01.000
And even with the, with the, one of the one of the very famous leaders black kettle.

429
00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:05.000
This was in Colorado.

430
00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:08.000
This happened in Colorado it's called Sand Creek.

431
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.000
I'm not too worried about it.

432
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:17.000
When we, when we did Native Americans who we actually had a, we had a Harvard there at Sand Creek itself.

433
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.000
But the black kettle.

434
00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.000
When it was at night.

435
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:24.000
And

436
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:30.000
he saw the soldiers coming, you know, we saw the horses and the soldiers coming, and he immediately raised a white flag.

437
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:36.000
Because he knew what they were going to do. He said, I surrender I surrender, leave my people alone I surrender.

438
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:39.000
And the army came in.

439
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:45.000
They killed every man, woman and child in that village.

440
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:52.000
Something like 100 250 innocent people.

441
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:55.000
So, this is the kind of karma.

442
00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:02.000
This country still has to address

443
00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:13.000
the rule mother, because everything was done to her we never, we never really, we just remember we went we decided spontaneously.

444
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:23.000
And we were going to go there because, you know, we just allowed mother to work through us. And again, it wasn't just me there were many European yogis that came to.

445
00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:30.000
And the way it started is this book, reading about black kettle.

446
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:35.000
All of the atrocious

447
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:46.000
committed against these innocent people. And the thing is, she might have even told us that the Native Americans were as a collective.

448
00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:50.000
They were getting ready to get their self realization.

449
00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:56.000
They were on the verge of becoming a realized collective.

450
00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:09.000
I'm getting so many vibrations now. And this mother told us I mean I think Karen is the he knows she even she knows that. And again, look what happened, you know,

451
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.000
a genocide.

452
00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:24.000
I mean people say it's two or 3 million people that's more than that more, you know, some, some historians place it at least 10 to 15 million innocent people were killed.

453
00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:27.000
And I just

454
00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:29.000
start.

455
00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:33.000
Men and women were raped.

456
00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:35.000
Children were massacred.

457
00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:40.000
So you can imagine what kind of karma, but again through mother.

458
00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:45.000
Some of it has been alleviated, because we had about.

459
00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:49.000
We did about six or seven Native American programs.

460
00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:53.000
When we went, we went on the reservation.

461
00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:56.000
We give self realization.

462
00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:01.000
We get a lot of happens on these

463
00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:03.000
worse.

464
00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:15.000
Who just many habits because the heavens were extremely important to clear the left side, because as you know, once you know the genocide occurred.

465
00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:26.000
You know the the the Native Americans, not only in America, Canada, but I wasn't in Canada. I can speak about that but I can speak about America.

466
00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:35.000
Once the same curve, this terrible genocide occurred by night by 1890.

467
00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:42.000
You know when wounded knee occurred and wounded knee was the last.

468
00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:50.000
I would like to say the last attempt at the Native Americans to maintain their culture and their way of life.

469
00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:53.000
And as you know, would it need is work.

470
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:55.000
290 of them were killed.

471
00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:57.000
Luckily, we were there.

472
00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:05.000
We actually had a, we had two three albums there are many yogis from Europe, and Americans we all prayed at one did need.

473
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.000
And we actually even put up the banner.

474
01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:21.000
I'll tell you how that happened but we put up actually, we're able to put up four banners of mother, mother, you know, huge banners of my mother's picture on the reservations.

475
01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:31.000
But the way this started is, I was watching TV one evening, and this man Native American. His name was Richard iron cloud.

476
01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.000
And he was talking about Pine Ridge.

477
01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:40.000
I hold on.

478
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Now Pine Ridge is a Lakota Sioux.

479
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
They're the Sioux nation.

480
01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.000
And they're Lakota.

481
01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:55.000
And he was on TV and on the 2020 news program 2020.

482
01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:04.000
He was talking about Pine Ridge, and how the poverty that was there. The suicides, you know the drug addiction know that.

483
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:14.000
And said oh my god you know why can't we just, you know, why can't I just call him and see if people like to hear about side yoga, and I was able to reach him.

484
01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:31.000
But if mothers work, you know, I say I but it's not me it's mother. Trust me because all of this came about because of her guidance and her attention on what it is that mother needed, you know, to save this country.

485
01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:43.000
You see, and so I was able to reach him very easily by the way, you know, and he said sure you know you said come, you know, come and he was in South Dakota.

486
01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
And.

487
01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.000
And so we organized the programs, the very first program.

488
01:01:49.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Jan Janice Janice was there, Brian was there. Ron became Iraqi brother because they eventually came to one of the Christian approaches in 2005.

489
01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.000
And through them, and to Richard iron cloud.

490
01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:10.000
We were able to give, we were able to go back to four times on time bridge itself.

491
01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:28.000
And we're able to give a realization to not a lot, because of the programs was not heavily attended. And there were some Caucasian people because many, you know, not many but you know Caucasian people work on the reservations.

492
01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:44.000
And some Caucasian people came, they were mostly Indians though. And, but the programs were not heavily attended. You know, I would say maybe, you know, not more than 20 at a program.

493
01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:50.000
And, but always vibrations were amazing. They were just amazing.

494
01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.000
And

495
01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.000
when we got a lot of people is when we get the power.

496
01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:14.000
You know the power is the celebration that the Native Americans have to music and dance. They have a gathering, they'll come together to dance music. Children are there. The women have their own dances, the men in the dance on their own.

497
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Anyway, so it's a celebration that is there, they're celebrating celebratory gatherings, and it the power was when we were able to get a lot of realization.

498
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.000
I mean, you know we were there for the weekend.

499
01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Pine Ridge, and we you know we give as much as two or 300 self realization.

500
01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:48.000
So the people that were very, very easily come and sit down. And the thing is, the Native Americans, because they were the first citizens of this country.

501
01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:54.000
They're the Shudis. Now they're all caught up now because, because of the genocide.

502
01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Okay.

503
01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000
And,

504
01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:10.000
but, but their connection to the verata to Lord Krishna is so great, because they could get realization like that.

505
01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:26.000
I mean, people will come they will sit down there, please would come up, we didn't even have to work. You know I hear, you know, in the in the regular programs, you know you'd have to work 20 minutes to half hour on a, you know, on regular people, you know, you have to work on their chakras,

506
01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:36.000
and you have to, you know, remove many many obstacles before the Kundalini can come up with the Native Americans. It was amazing.

507
01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:53.000
The Kundalini's would come up so easily, and they would get realization like that. So quickly, because they were the first citizens of this country, and they were so, so fully connected to Krishna.

508
01:04:53.000 --> 01:05:05.000
You know, and, unfortunately, of course, because of the genocide because of the past, you know, the Rishuji's are caught up.

509
01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:19.000
But the Kundalini's would come up really quickly. So basically, since 2004 to 2018 that the pandemic came, then we had to stop. So the last one was in 2018.

510
01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:33.000
But during that time we had about six or seven Native American tours. And during that time with what I saw is the change in what is happening the Native American.

511
01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Sorry my phone is ringing. It's okay.

512
01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:41.000
We saw the change, what is happening in the Native American communities.

513
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:49.000
First of all, two ladies are now part of the Congress in Washington.

514
01:05:49.000 --> 01:06:01.000
And two, three years ago, Deb Haaland, she actually became the Secretary of the Interior. She's from Mexico. She's part Swedish and part Pueblo.

515
01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:20.000
And she's actually now the head of the very big Department of the Interior where she's in control. And she's makes the laws regarding the lands in America, your national parks, and so forth.

516
01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:43.000
And she also started when she came into, she started her position, she also started a group for missing and murdered indigenous women, because that is something that has been going on for years and years.

517
01:06:43.000 --> 01:07:01.000
And now they're really, really bringing a lot of attention into it. And they're trying to stop because the attacks that the Indian women experience on the reservations and outside of the reservation is horrible, horrible.

518
01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:15.000
So Deb Haaland actually started this part of her department where they are, you know, looking into this and trying to, you know, trying to stop this.

519
01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:21.000
And so, since 2004, so many things have happened.

520
01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000
The Native Americans are waking up.

521
01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.000
And this is what mother needs.

522
01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:31.000
They need to come out of the left side. Okay.

523
01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Because, because the genocide.

524
01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:42.000
They were so horribly damaged.

525
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
You know that

526
01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:49.000
they ended up with drugs, suicides,

527
01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:55.000
alcoholism, I mean, didn't even know alcoholism. White people brought the alcohol.

528
01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:05.000
The white people, they would put smallpox underneath the beds.

529
01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:12.000
You know, just part, just all part of the genocide of how

530
01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:21.000
dominating, you know, force wants, wants to subdue an innocent

531
01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
people.

532
01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
And this is what happened in America.

533
01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:31.000
But also what's happening now on a very positive note is that

534
01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
they're waking up now.

535
01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:36.000
The movement is there.

536
01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:43.000
The movement for them to, you know, get their rights again.

537
01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.000
They are voting now, many of them are voting.

538
01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Many of them are, you know, seeking help, you know, for their addictions and so forth.

539
01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:58.000
And I know that because on the reservations, they all have, you know, health services.

540
01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:03.000
And many of them, you know, are being helped.

541
01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:09.000
But also what's important is that this left side is not fully yet healed.

542
01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
The left side is still there.

543
01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:28.000
But Shri Mataji is slowly, slowly healing it, you know, so that once the American society fully recognizes what they did

544
01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:36.000
and they admit to this genocide, then the virata, then Lord Krishna can be fully awakened.

545
01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:44.000
See, and if you read, if you listen to Shri Mataji's incredible video,

546
01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Puja 1989, the Virata Puja, you have to listen to that because this is, this is where Mother addresses all of these issues.

547
01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:02.000
So what I'm telling you is not, you know, me, it's Mother.

548
01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
It's her information.

549
01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:10.000
And she tells us on this video, and we say it's Virata Puja, right? Krishna.

550
01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.000
You know, Krishna fully awakened in our brain.

551
01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:19.000
And that was, by the way, was the most powerful Puja I've ever attended.

552
01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:25.000
We all, you know, you know, I think all of the Pujas are powerful.

553
01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Each Puja has its own, you know, importance.

554
01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:34.000
But in each Puja, Mother is working on something really, really important.

555
01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:43.000
You know that. And in the Virata Puja 1989, Shri Mataji worked out so much for the Native Americans.

556
01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:53.000
And she told us because so many Native Americans were killed so viciously, you know, so viciously,

557
01:10:53.000 --> 01:11:00.000
so atrociously and so terrible that they became lost souls.

558
01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:09.000
They became confused souls. And they were left hanging, you know, in the air because they were confused.

559
01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:16.000
They had died so badly and so terribly that, you know, they were lost.

560
01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:23.000
And this created like a cloud over the American society, you see.

561
01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:32.000
And so many problems that this country had, the drugs, the alcohol, the guns, stems from this karma.

562
01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:41.000
You see, even the guns, you know, and even one time I was talking to one of the Yogi's.

563
01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:44.000
He's a lawyer and he was of good kinds with Grecois.

564
01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:50.000
And when Grecois would come to New York, he would, you know, go to Jim's house because they were both lawyers.

565
01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:56.000
They were very good friends. And Jim, he got the Lyme disease.

566
01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:07.000
OK, you know, Lyme disease is. They're like, you know, they take these little ticks that gives them really, really bad infections.

567
01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:19.000
And Jim told me that Grecois told him that Srimadaji said that Lyme disease is actually the little microbes.

568
01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:30.000
They're like little insects. And they are the souls of Native Americans that are trying to get their revenge and the white people for taking their land.

569
01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Isn't that incredible? You see, it's amazing.

570
01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:39.000
When I read that, when I when Jim told me that, I said, wow.

571
01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:49.000
So. What's needed to be done now, you know.

572
01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:54.000
The left side still has the clear. It's not fully there yet, but it's still there.

573
01:12:54.000 --> 01:13:00.000
And what's extremely important. What I feel is extremely important.

574
01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:07.000
And you guys can, you know, let me know what you think is that the United States government.

575
01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:18.000
As to the government itself, the president, the politicians, they have to go in front of the American people and they have to ask for forgiveness.

576
01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:24.000
From the Native Americans, because it was been done to them, that has never happened.

577
01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:31.000
There's there to be a dynamic and powerful truth and reconciliation.

578
01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:45.000
For the Native Americans, because if that's not done through the American government and them speaking to the American people and admitting, yes, we did this, we ask for forgiveness.

579
01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:51.000
The virata would not pull it open. But on the other hand, what has to happen?

580
01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:58.000
You Native Americans have to forgive. You see, and.

581
01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Some of it is there, and to be honest with you, some of it is not.

582
01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:11.000
So some are angry. Rightfully, they still have anger.

583
01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:18.000
But on the majority of the people that I dealt with on the reservations that I even saw my friends, they're very forgiving.

584
01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:27.000
You know, because most of the Native Americans, you know, they still have a great connection to the earth.

585
01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Whereas most of us don't. You know, we don't we don't have that. But the Native Americans, all indigenous people, not only the Native Americans, all indigenous Aboriginals in Australia.

586
01:14:39.000 --> 01:15:06.000
They all have a great connection to the earth and the elements, you see, and this makes them, you know, forgiving. That's why I found that because they still have, they still have respect and believe in the elements of the earth, the sun, the moon, you know, and it's invited in them.

587
01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:19.000
It's invited in their DNA, even the modern ones, even if you speak with the modern Native Americans. And I met so many of them, the young, you know, the teens, the teenagers.

588
01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:34.000
It's in their DNA, you know. So we just have to, as Yogi's, we just have to pray and desire that the U.S. government

589
01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:48.000
does this truth and reconciliation for the Native Americans and that the Native Americans also fully forgive, fully.

590
01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:56.000
And I think once that happens, I think, you know, the karma will be alleviated in this country.

591
01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:21.000
This is what I've learned, you know, through the Native American programs and it's amazing. I mean, the tours that we did, if you basically, you know, I don't know why the power in that company.

592
01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Are you losing power, Anna? Yeah, but it's connected.

593
01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:38.000
But yeah, go ahead. No, I just had the one question is getting a little bit late.

594
01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:44.000
Also, I just wanted to ask, is there any plans to start up these meetings again?

595
01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:48.000
You know, the thing is, after the pandemic, you know, everything stopped, you know.

596
01:16:48.000 --> 01:17:00.000
And when I was in the Pine Ridge, I actually stayed in Pine Ridge from 2007 to 2008, I even got a car, believe it or not.

597
01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:14.000
2017, I went there in November 2016. And then I was there until May 2017.

598
01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:19.000
And while I was there, I worked as a substitute teacher on the reservation with the children.

599
01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:30.000
And it was, I did programs there. And every week people would come, but they would come and they would go. Nobody actually stayed on.

600
01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:39.000
And nobody actually, you know, nobody really, you know, became Yoties, you know.

601
01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:46.000
So the programs right now, there are no programs going on.

602
01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:54.000
I'm in the midst of moving because I, you know, I have so many personal things that I need to address.

603
01:17:54.000 --> 01:18:02.000
And so I haven't done anything yet because if I don't address these personal issues, I'm just going to have more problems, you know.

604
01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:11.000
But what I want to do is, I'm going to try and contact a Native American community here in New York.

605
01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Once I get settled in my new place, I will try and contact them to see if they want any programs.

606
01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:24.000
I did contact them many, about maybe seven, eight years ago.

607
01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:30.000
I did a fair with them because they did a health fair with their people.

608
01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:39.000
And I called them and they allowed me to go. And then I contacted a couple of them afterwards, but they weren't interested in doing any follow ups, you know.

609
01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:47.000
So what I'm going to do is once I get my personal stuff out of the way, I'm going to try and see if I can do some programs again.

610
01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:51.000
And maybe do another tour. I don't know yet.

611
01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:58.000
But, you know, we have to see where, we have to see where our divine mother wants us to go, you know.

612
01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:05.000
That's where she needs us. That's the most important thing.

613
01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Yeah.

614
01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:11.000
But, you know, since the pandemic, you know, many things slow down.

615
01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:22.000
But then also during the pandemic, it was hard to, you know, it was hard to do anything because I'm not a technical person.

616
01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
I can't get a use on me with this.

617
01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Yes, yes.

618
01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:28.000
I said yes. Yes, indeed.

619
01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:37.000
You know, so, but I think soon once I get all settled, I hope I hope through mother, you know, that we'll see what she needs.

620
01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Any questions?

621
01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:52.000
We just have, so how do you, we just have to, because, you know, the Native Americans, if they get there, you would be surprised.

622
01:19:52.000 --> 01:20:02.000
One time, you know, Fabrizio, many of you know Fabrizio and Cozeta, they came two, three times to the tours.

623
01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:07.000
And one time, this one man came up to Fabrizio, we were appointed to buy something.

624
01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:15.000
And this one came, one Indian came up to him and was asking for money, you know, because many, because there are many, many are poor.

625
01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:18.000
It's changing now. It's changing.

626
01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:21.000
This was about seven years ago. We were in Pine Ridge.

627
01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:26.000
And this man came up to him and said, can you give me some money? Fabrizio is broken English.

628
01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:34.000
She says, I'm going to give you a gift. Now he said he told us, we weren't there, but then he told us, big man, this man was older.

629
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:41.000
He was an alcoholic. He was like really sick. He was an alcoholic. He was smoking.

630
01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:45.000
And Fabrizio said, look, I'm going to give you a gift. He said, hold out your hand.

631
01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:51.000
So the man who held out his hand, his kundalini came up in seconds.

632
01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:57.000
Can you imagine that the man is an alcoholic? He's poor. I mean, he didn't have any teeth.

633
01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:02.000
You know, you could see that he was, you know, physically, he was not even well.

634
01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:16.000
But his kundalini came up in seconds. It's amazing how, you know, how the Native Americans, how they're still, you know, so.

635
01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:19.000
What's the word?

636
01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:24.000
You know, they're so ready. They're so ready.

637
01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:31.000
They're what? So ready. They're ready. Yes. But also, you know, nobody became yogis.

638
01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:37.000
And I spent a lot of time, you know, on the reservation. I worked there, you know.

639
01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:42.000
But again, you know, who are we to say he's not a yogi, he's not a yogi?

640
01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:47.000
You know, you become a yogi on your own through, through Shri Mataji and through Shri Ganesha.

641
01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:50.000
That's how you become a yogi. So.

642
01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:55.000
You know, because she was it, Shri Ganesha was it and also our desire.

643
01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:08.000
So, but who knows? But things are, you know, things now, they are way, way better than they were, you know, 20, 20 years ago. Way better.

644
01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:13.000
And now through them, what I want to do is me and I want to get a couple of other yogis.

645
01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:24.000
We can I want to write them how long, you know. Once I get my stuff out of the way from this car, this house, I want to I want to write to her.

646
01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:33.000
And see if we can meet with her because because she is such a good person, you know, and I'm just going to stop the recording.
