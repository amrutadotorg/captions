Shri Ganesha Gauri Puja

00:00:16.851 --> 00:00:20.843
Sydney, Australia

00:00:21.044 --> 00:00:24.837
April 4, 1981

00:01:36.947 --> 00:01:41.179
Today is a very unique thing that is happened,

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:48.222
is a special luck for Sahaja yogis of Australia.

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.110
This day has never been celebrated before

00:01:52.311 --> 00:01:54.866
in the history of Sahaja Yoga.

00:01:55.067 --> 00:01:59.272
Today is the New Year’s Day for Sahaja yogis,

00:01:59.473 --> 00:02:06.747
because this is the New Year’s Day

00:02:06.948 --> 00:02:09.750
of the Shalivahan calendar.

00:02:09.951 --> 00:02:14.243
As you know, Shalivahan is My dynasty,

00:02:14.444 --> 00:02:16.768
and they are called as Shalivahan

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:19.598
because they are the carriers of the shawls of the Goddess,

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:22.724
they are called as the, because as you are also carrying

00:02:22.938 --> 00:02:26.697
so many times My shawls around.

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:29.203
And they were called as Shalivahan.

00:02:29.404 --> 00:02:38.119
So this New Year’s Day is the first day of advent of Goddess,

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.324
the nine days there are.

00:02:41.757 --> 00:02:49.814
Then in another times that there are Satya Yug,

00:02:50.015 --> 00:02:55.130
then there’s Dvapara, Treta, Kali Yuga: there are four yugas.

00:02:55.331 --> 00:02:59.792
So in two yugas the Goddess incarnated,

00:02:59.978 --> 00:03:04.146
one before the Satya Yuga and one after it.

00:03:04.886 --> 00:03:11.075
So today is the day to mark absolutely the first day

00:03:11.276 --> 00:03:15.596
when She incarnated on this Earth.

00:03:16.255 --> 00:03:19.848
That’s the day also of the Gauri,

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:24.869
because Virgin is the first form of the Goddess.

00:03:26.001 --> 00:03:39.523
And She created also Ganesha on Tuesday,

00:03:39.724 --> 00:03:42.919
just starting this week.

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.723
What is the day? The day today is …?

00:03:45.924 --> 00:03:47.178
[Today’s the fourth.]

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:48.379
Today ….

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.021
[Saturday, Mother.]

00:03:51.792 --> 00:03:53.740
[Saturday.]

00:03:53.941 --> 00:03:57.969
Saturday. Now, now, it’s over. Now don’t stay, all right?

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.375
While I’m speaking you should not take My photographs.

00:04:00.576 --> 00:04:03.287
It’s a very wrong idea, because it disturbs Me.

00:04:03.488 --> 00:04:06.255
Moreover, you see, when the speaking, while I’m speaking

00:04:06.456 --> 00:04:07.590
and when you take My photograph

00:04:07.791 --> 00:04:10.454
sometimes I’ve seen they come out very odd.

00:04:10.655 --> 00:04:12.820
Best take photographs when I’m not speaking, you see,

00:04:13.021 --> 00:04:16.496
because all the time the sound is coming, everybody is distracted

00:04:16.697 --> 00:04:18.809
and the attention doesn’t fix, you see.

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.245
Is a very important thing I’m talking, all right?

00:04:21.446 --> 00:04:24.456
Now don’t take any photographs, please.

00:04:24.657 --> 00:04:27.813
Pay attention to what I’m saying.

00:04:28.208 --> 00:04:31.114
[Hindi]

00:04:39.695 --> 00:04:45.579
So Tuesday is the day when Ganesha was established,

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:52.254
and then the Goddess started working.

00:04:52.455 --> 00:04:58.392
The first one, the one day when She started is, was the Wednesday.

00:04:58.593 --> 00:05:01.237
She started working out on Wednesday.

00:05:01.438 --> 00:05:04.316
Wednesday is the action day,

00:05:04.517 --> 00:05:07.107
that’s why she started on Wednesday.

00:05:07.308 --> 00:05:11.484
Today is, under the circumstances it is Saturday;

00:05:11.685 --> 00:05:16.052
but I’m telling you about the original timings.

00:05:18.477 --> 00:05:22.864
Because Wednesday is the day of the Swadisthana,

00:05:23.065 --> 00:05:27.588
that’s the day She started working it out, the whole thing.

00:05:27.897 --> 00:05:32.193
So first, Tuesday is the first day in Sahaja Yoga,

00:05:32.394 --> 00:05:34.986
Wednesday is the second day.

00:05:35.187 --> 00:05:39.919
And you’ll be surprised that the stars are also the same,

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.571
because Tuesday is the day of the Mars

00:05:44.772 --> 00:05:49.389
which is resided by Shri Ganesh.

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:56.655
Wednesday is the day of Mercury, and Mercury is the Swadisthana.

00:05:57.358 --> 00:06:07.667
Third day – yes – third day is the day of Jupiter:

00:06:07.868 --> 00:06:11.157
what you call, we call it guru, is the day of the guru,

00:06:11.358 --> 00:06:14.873
is the Jupiter, is the teacher.

00:06:17.186 --> 00:06:20.275
Now, Friday is the day of the Goddess.

00:06:20.476 --> 00:06:23.814
Now see the chakras also, of the Goddess,

00:06:24.015 --> 00:06:27.103
Mother of the Earth, Mother of the Universe,

00:06:27.304 --> 00:06:29.546
Venus.

00:06:31.008 --> 00:06:35.111
But in Indian Sanskrit language the names of the days

00:06:35.312 --> 00:06:40.577
are exactly the same, tallying with the stars,

00:06:42.128 --> 00:06:48.713
Then Saturday is the day of Shri Krishna, Shani, is Saturn.

00:06:52.675 --> 00:06:57.206
Then Sunday is the day of Christ, the Sun.

00:06:59.008 --> 00:07:03.863
Monday is the day of Sadashiva,

00:07:04.064 --> 00:07:07.665
is of realization, of integration.

00:07:08.299 --> 00:07:13.033
These are the seven days when God created the whole universe.

00:07:16.012 --> 00:07:18.468
That’s what I told yesterday, that in this narrow way

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:20.875
you cannot understand Christianity.

00:07:21.076 --> 00:07:24.888
You’ll think it’s all mad, which is not.

00:07:25.089 --> 00:07:27.928
Only when you read other things, other scriptures,

00:07:28.129 --> 00:07:32.324
then only you will understand what Christ said.

00:07:32.759 --> 00:07:37.605
So today is the day of – first day –

00:07:37.806 --> 00:07:40.264
of when Ganesha was created,

00:07:40.465 --> 00:07:47.600
in the sense that, though today is not a Tuesday,

00:07:47.801 --> 00:07:53.403
but according to dates of the moon,

00:07:53.604 --> 00:08:01.225
today is the day, first day of the moon in this month.

00:08:01.787 --> 00:08:02.961
[Marathi]

00:08:03.162 --> 00:08:07.036
Chaitra. We call it Chaitra. Chaitra is the month.

00:08:07.237 --> 00:08:08.970
And this is the time when –

00:08:09.171 --> 00:08:12.651
[Marathi]

00:08:18.064 --> 00:08:19.656
Gauri is the Chaitra.

00:08:19.857 --> 00:08:22.074
So the establishment of the Gauri

00:08:22.275 --> 00:08:24.962
is taken place during these nine days.

00:08:25.163 --> 00:08:29.097
But Ganesha has to be established before anything else.

00:08:29.298 --> 00:08:31.626
Though first Gauri had to come,

00:08:31.827 --> 00:08:37.225
you can see that. Gauri had to come first to establish Ganesha.

00:08:37.426 --> 00:08:41.467
But Ganesha is always put before even Gauri.

00:08:41.668 --> 00:08:48.016
Before the pujana of the, worship of the Ganesha,

00:08:48.217 --> 00:08:50.003
nothing starts;

00:08:50.204 --> 00:08:53.369
because He’s the one who takes out all the obstacles,

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:56.339
all the negativities,

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:59.049
all the hurdles that are going to come up,

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:03.992
all the attentions that are here and there.

00:09:04.193 --> 00:09:06.728
So that’s why we first worship Ganesha,

00:09:06.929 --> 00:09:09.684
just to ask Him to protect us.

00:09:09.885 --> 00:09:11.647
But first the Gauri has to come,

00:09:11.848 --> 00:09:16.694
and that’s how the Gauri is this nine days.

00:09:16.895 --> 00:09:23.827
She came on this Earth to fight the devils and demons,

00:09:24.028 --> 00:09:31.897
negativity, for people to transcend

00:09:32.098 --> 00:09:36.695
the Bhavasagara, the Void,

00:09:36.896 --> 00:09:40.465
the maya, the illusion.

00:09:40.666 --> 00:09:44.914
When they were praying, when they were doing anything,

00:09:45.115 --> 00:09:47.799
people used to obstruct

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.147
and then they troubled the bhaktas, the devotees of God.

00:09:53.348 --> 00:09:59.689
Rakshasas, in those days the rakshasas were separate

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:02.575
and the saints were separate;

00:10:02.776 --> 00:10:05.573
there was not such a mixture as it is today.

00:10:05.774 --> 00:10:09.054
We find in saints there are negativities sitting there.

00:10:09.255 --> 00:10:12.437
Was never so before. This is Kali Yuga.

00:10:12.638 --> 00:10:15.476
It’s such a confusion that there is no absolute saint

00:10:15.677 --> 00:10:18.070
or there’s no absolute rakshasas.

00:10:18.271 --> 00:10:21.486
These rakshasas have come and sitting in our heads.

00:10:21.687 --> 00:10:24.332
They are within us, so the negativity is there,

00:10:24.533 --> 00:10:27.154
so we are not absolute saints.

00:10:27.355 --> 00:10:30.609
And this is the big problem of Sahaja Yoga is, that

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:32.873
even when you are worshipping Me,

00:10:33.074 --> 00:10:37.244
try to be more on the saints than on the negative side.

00:10:37.445 --> 00:10:40.690
Try to be more on the saintly side.

00:10:40.891 --> 00:10:43.170
Because you are saints, no doubt,

00:10:43.371 --> 00:10:47.114
but these horrible things have somehow or other

00:10:47.315 --> 00:10:49.723
gone into your heads and they are sitting in

00:10:49.924 --> 00:10:53.633
your superego and ego, these horrible negativities,

00:10:53.834 --> 00:10:57.664
which you must really decide today to throw them away.

00:10:57.865 --> 00:11:03.117
Because you are really saints and these are the bad spots,

00:11:03.318 --> 00:11:05.477
kalanka.

00:11:05.678 --> 00:11:08.897
Is the thing that really ruins you, is within you.

00:11:09.098 --> 00:11:13.008
So try to throw it away; try to become positive,

00:11:13.209 --> 00:11:15.783
be one with the puja.

00:11:15.984 --> 00:11:23.112
The second thing is the importance of this day is,

00:11:23.313 --> 00:11:29.626
that I have never celebrated this first day anywhere, so far.

00:11:30.774 --> 00:11:33.776
It was to be in Australia.

00:11:33.977 --> 00:11:37.770
It is the right of Australia to have this day here,

00:11:37.971 --> 00:11:40.611
celebrated here.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:51.595
We had other pujas, other Navaratris we had;

00:11:51.796 --> 00:11:54.113
with that I celebrated the first, second, third,

00:11:54.314 --> 00:11:55.970
over nine days we have done.

00:11:56.171 --> 00:11:58.163
But never this Navaratri as such

00:11:58.364 --> 00:12:02.313
we have celebrated this day anywhere, of the Shalivahana.

00:12:02.514 --> 00:12:06.323
Though in London they had a little sort of a thing on this, which I,

00:12:06.524 --> 00:12:10.309
we had on the seventh of April, then I spoke about it;

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:15.867
but actually on this day we had no puja, before.

00:12:16.068 --> 00:12:22.513
So, this is very creditable that it should happen here.

00:12:22.714 --> 00:12:29.676
I’m very happy, because this is where Gauri established Shri Ganesh.

00:12:36.904 --> 00:12:41.454
Now for today we have two things to be worshipped:

00:12:41.655 --> 00:12:48.803
one, Ganesha, because Ganesha can preserve our status,

00:12:49.008 --> 00:12:52.654
our heights,

00:12:52.855 --> 00:12:54.631
in our realization.

00:12:54.832 --> 00:12:57.798
He protects us when we are getting our realization,

00:12:57.999 --> 00:13:00.068
we are rising high;

00:13:00.269 --> 00:13:03.653
so He preserves and He protects.

00:13:03.854 --> 00:13:10.667
And He looks after us and gives us wisdom,

00:13:10.868 --> 00:13:16.614
to have our ascent in such a way

00:13:16.815 --> 00:13:21.123
that we do not deviate into the left and the right side;

00:13:21.324 --> 00:13:24.139
we have full dignity;

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:30.036
and that we are fully integrated with our heart,

00:13:30.237 --> 00:13:33.584
with Shiva Tattwa, with our realization,

00:13:33.785 --> 00:13:37.010
and do it with our heart genuinely.

00:13:37.211 --> 00:13:40.953
That’s why we worship Shri Ganesh.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.474
But today is actually the puja of the Gauri,

00:13:45.675 --> 00:13:47.982
that is, the Kundalini.

00:13:48.183 --> 00:13:51.518
So Shri Ganesh we’ll do first of all,

00:13:51.738 --> 00:13:55.657
and then we’ll worship the Kundalini, which is the Gauri.

00:13:55.883 --> 00:14:01.611
Now luckily I got a sari: this is really remarkable,

00:14:01.812 --> 00:14:05.346
because this is the color of Australia.

00:14:05.547 --> 00:14:09.642
Green is the color of the Gauri. Gauri wears the green sari.

00:14:09.843 --> 00:14:13.636
And there is also – this is the, this is the,

00:14:13.837 --> 00:14:17.350
this is the symbol of Gauri only.

00:14:17.551 --> 00:14:22.902
This is the symbol of Gauri, and this one inside is the Ganesha,

00:14:23.103 --> 00:14:26.483
is in that color, is most surprising this sari I got.

00:14:26.684 --> 00:14:28.670
So this one also is just the other way round,

00:14:28.871 --> 00:14:32.730
more of Ganesha color and less of the Gauri color.

00:14:32.931 --> 00:14:36.825
This is a very traditional combination

00:14:37.026 --> 00:14:42.276
in the Indian color scheme, because red is the color of Ganesha.

00:14:44.203 --> 00:14:50.519
In you people it is very red and it can become more crimson,

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.957
can become absolutely black,

00:14:53.158 --> 00:14:57.070
can be absolutely reduced to nothing.

00:14:57.271 --> 00:15:06.720
But in Me it is the color of this clay,

00:15:06.921 --> 00:15:10.285
because it’s absolutely obedient, it’s absolutely one with Me,

00:15:10.486 --> 00:15:15.509
so it’s the color of the clay. And the Gauri is the Mother Earth.

00:15:16.571 --> 00:15:21.470
That’s the place where the Gauri exists, in the Mother Earth;

00:15:21.671 --> 00:15:23.813
and that’s why the color is green

00:15:24.014 --> 00:15:27.053
because Mother Earth is always covered with green,

00:15:27.254 --> 00:15:30.508
at least She’s covered with.

00:15:30.789 --> 00:15:34.579
And Ganesha’s color is that of the clay

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:37.453
because He’s made out of the Mother Earth,

00:15:37.654 --> 00:15:40.739
element is the Mother Earth.

00:15:41.936 --> 00:15:47.865
I hope I have been able to explain to you the symbolic relationship.

00:15:48.679 --> 00:15:52.634
Do you know the story how Ganesha was created by Gauri?

00:15:52.835 --> 00:15:55.578
So that I will tell you; and then we all can have.

00:15:55.779 --> 00:16:00.864
It’s very interesting, that’s why I said I’ll have My bath here.

00:16:02.073 --> 00:16:03.073
It is said this ….

00:16:03.274 --> 00:16:06.702
[Excuse me, Mother, we can’t hear very well down the back.]

00:16:06.903 --> 00:16:09.382
[Is there any way You can speak louder or that we can hear better?]

00:16:09.583 --> 00:16:10.442
What’s she say?

00:16:10.643 --> 00:16:11.536
[They cannot hear.]

00:16:11.737 --> 00:16:12.962
You can’t hear Me?e …]

00:16:13.163 --> 00:16:14.163
[Yogini: No, Mother.]

00:16:14.378 --> 00:16:18.112
All right, so I’ll have to shout.

00:16:18.927 --> 00:16:19.989
Not at all?

00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:21.540
[Yogini: Yes, a little, most of the time...]

00:16:21.741 --> 00:16:24.458
All right. Should I use this?

00:16:26.124 --> 00:16:29.030
All right. This you can hear.

00:16:31.834 --> 00:16:37.259
So I’m now going to tell you

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:40.405
the story of Shri Ganesha’s birth.

00:16:40.606 --> 00:16:44.972
Is very interesting, it’s very symbolic. This is Christ, and that is,

00:16:45.173 --> 00:16:49.317
He is the Omega and He is the Alpha and all that they talk of,

00:16:49.518 --> 00:16:51.765
they don’t know what they are talking.

00:16:51.966 --> 00:16:55.558
There’s so short form of what the whole thing is.

00:16:55.759 --> 00:16:58.188
They don’t know Ganesha at all, nothing.

00:16:58.389 --> 00:17:03.599
They just take one word here and there, just talk like that.

00:17:05.018 --> 00:17:09.125
So He’s the first one created.

00:17:09.778 --> 00:17:12.506
Now it’s very symbolic:

00:17:12.707 --> 00:17:15.779
the pure power

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:23.480
of desire to be one with the spirit is symbolized in the Gauri.

00:17:23.681 --> 00:17:28.286
The primordial Gauri is that power

00:17:28.487 --> 00:17:32.461
which has separated from Her Lord,

00:17:32.658 --> 00:17:35.486
we can say.

00:17:36.405 --> 00:17:39.959
In Her previous lives She was separated,

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:43.822
and again She’s born as Parvati.

00:17:44.023 --> 00:17:49.491
And She wants to be one with Shiva, which is the Spirit.

00:17:51.089 --> 00:17:53.824
So now the marriage has taken place,

00:17:54.025 --> 00:17:57.758
in the sense that now She can meet Him.

00:17:57.959 --> 00:18:01.404
The wedding kindling has to start.

00:18:02.138 --> 00:18:03.784
But She’s not yet married,

00:18:03.985 --> 00:18:05.870
in the sense that She’s still a Virgin,

00:18:06.071 --> 00:18:14.315
but married otherwise – means She is now about to rise.

00:18:14.791 --> 00:18:18.742
Before that She wants to have a bath,

00:18:18.943 --> 00:18:21.883
because She has to meet Her Lord.

00:18:22.084 --> 00:18:25.632
So She must have Her bath, the bridal bath.

00:18:25.833 --> 00:18:30.997
She’s a virgin, absolutely virgin, and She goes for Her bath.

00:18:32.053 --> 00:18:34.953
Now, She’s afraid that anybody might come inside

00:18:35.154 --> 00:18:38.075
when She’s having Her bath.

00:18:38.985 --> 00:18:41.244
Look at the delicacy of the whole thing:

00:18:41.445 --> 00:18:46.154
this desire, which just is meant for the spirit,

00:18:46.355 --> 00:18:48.632
doesn’t want to be exposed to anything else,

00:18:48.833 --> 00:18:52.450
any negativity coming in, anything happening like that.

00:18:53.239 --> 00:18:56.545
So She closes the door,

00:18:56.746 --> 00:19:01.597
but still She’s worried from the back side somebody may come.

00:19:02.099 --> 00:19:12.846
So She puts this scented powder, which we use in India,

00:19:13.047 --> 00:19:16.329
for the bride specially it is the right one,

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:19.283
and rubs Her body with that, and She finds

00:19:19.484 --> 00:19:22.693
that a lot of it comes out. So She makes the Ganesha out of that,

00:19:22.894 --> 00:19:27.151
now imagine how much vibrated it must be.

00:19:30.693 --> 00:19:33.687
She puts that – is made of camphor

00:19:33.888 --> 00:19:37.859
and all these beautiful things which are really celestial –

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:42.599
and that is completely vibrated on Her body.

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:48.339
She makes a Ganesha and puts Him to the back of the bathroom;

00:19:48.904 --> 00:19:51.571
She’s having Her bath nicely.

00:19:51.772 --> 00:19:56.869
At that time Shiva comes suddenly, knocks at the door.

00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:59.421
She doesn’t hear Him.

00:19:59.622 --> 00:20:05.504
So He goes from the back door. There
He sees Shri Ganesha sitting.

00:20:06.443 --> 00:20:08.787
He asks Shri Ganesha, “Who are You?”

00:20:08.978 --> 00:20:13.577
So He says, “I am the Son of Gauri.”

00:20:13.791 --> 00:20:16.538
Shiva can’t understand; She is a Virgin

00:20:16.739 --> 00:20:19.602
and this one is saying, “I am the Son of the Gauri.”

00:20:19.803 --> 00:20:23.672
See now the Immaculate Conception,

00:20:23.873 --> 00:20:26.191
try to understand.

00:20:26.392 --> 00:20:34.338
So Shiva says, “How can She have a child? She is the Virgin.”

00:20:34.539 --> 00:20:39.341
And He thinks [She’s] He’s bringing slander on His wife who is a Virgin.

00:20:39.542 --> 00:20:44.053
So He cuts His neck in anger,

00:20:44.254 --> 00:20:46.856
and He enters into the bathroom.

00:20:47.058 --> 00:20:50.937
And Gauri is ready to receive Him.

00:20:51.144 --> 00:20:55.083
And She looks out and She sees Her child is dead.

00:20:55.284 --> 00:21:00.088
So He asked Her, “What is this?”

00:21:00.289 --> 00:21:05.017
Said, “That’s My child I created out of My, this mala” –

00:21:05.218 --> 00:21:08.255
what you call this, all the body things that came out –

00:21:08.456 --> 00:21:12.134
“I’ve created Him, and I have put Him down there.

00:21:12.335 --> 00:21:15.163
How dare You kill Him?”

00:21:15.458 --> 00:21:17.552
She said, “ Now what to do?”

00:21:17.753 --> 00:21:20.364
He said, “All right, what You do is to go

00:21:20.565 --> 00:21:28.129
and find the head of any animal that is available,

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:32.481
and we will put that on this trunk

00:21:32.698 --> 00:21:36.297
and He’ll be My son again.”

00:21:36.498 --> 00:21:40.657
Now it’s all prearranged;

00:21:40.865 --> 00:21:44.776
because this child was not to grow into

00:21:44.977 --> 00:21:47.859
a human ego and superego business.

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:52.231
It had to be the embodiment of childhood,

00:21:52.432 --> 00:21:57.767
embodiment of childlike innocence,

00:21:57.968 --> 00:22:01.016
because He’s the embodiment of innocence.

00:22:01.217 --> 00:22:04.778
So they had to get the head of an animal.

00:22:04.979 --> 00:22:13.904
Now the wisest animal on this Earth is elephant,

00:22:14.105 --> 00:22:17.676
and elephant was saved in evolution in a very miraculous way,

00:22:17.877 --> 00:22:21.603
is also another description which I’ll give you later on.

00:22:21.987 --> 00:22:25.721
So a she-elephant, mother elephant

00:22:25.922 --> 00:22:29.805
was lying down with her back towards her child,

00:22:30.006 --> 00:22:33.553
that’s why in India women never sleep with their back

00:22:33.754 --> 00:22:35.897
towards their children, never.

00:22:36.098 --> 00:22:39.734
The child has to be in front, pudhe, in front.

00:22:39.935 --> 00:22:43.227
It should never be put at the back of the mother, never.

00:22:43.428 --> 00:22:46.948
Mother will get up and go on the other side and change the sides,

00:22:47.149 --> 00:22:49.717
but she would never put the child at the back.

00:22:49.918 --> 00:22:53.613
So the head of that little animal was cut,

00:22:53.814 --> 00:22:57.832
and He brought it and was put for Shri Ganesh.

00:22:58.033 --> 00:23:01.829
And that’s how Shri Ganesha was created.

00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:11.411
But you know, elephant is the conveyance of Mahalakshmi.

00:23:12.677 --> 00:23:17.363
So the body is from Mahakali,

00:23:17.564 --> 00:23:23.064
but the head is given by Mahalakshmi, the evolutionary power.

00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:35.127
Now this Ganesha within us resides

00:23:35.328 --> 00:23:38.328
in the Mooladhara Chakra.

00:23:38.937 --> 00:23:43.633
Some people who tried all kinds of tricks to find God

00:23:43.834 --> 00:23:50.154
must have seen the trunk of Shri Ganesha,

00:23:50.355 --> 00:23:52.965
and must have thought this is the kundalini,

00:23:53.166 --> 00:23:56.632
because as a Mother I give them few marks for that,

00:23:56.818 --> 00:23:59.411
and that’s how they started all these perversions

00:23:59.612 --> 00:24:02.058
and wrong things about Ganesha.

00:24:02.274 --> 00:24:05.841
But He is embodiment of innocence,

00:24:06.042 --> 00:24:10.449
and later on you must read in “Devi Bhagwat”

00:24:10.658 --> 00:24:16.657
how He incarnated on this Earth as Christ;

00:24:16.862 --> 00:24:20.769
and how He is going to come with His eleven powers

00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:23.744
on this Earth as Kalki.

00:24:23.945 --> 00:24:26.587
It is very difficult for Hindus to accept that Ganesha,

00:24:26.788 --> 00:24:28.752
such a dynamic personality like Him,

00:24:28.953 --> 00:24:32.403
should become a person like Christ, who got Himself crucified.

00:24:32.618 --> 00:24:34.323
And it is impossible,

00:24:34.524 --> 00:24:36.552
at least Hindus have much wider knowledge

00:24:36.753 --> 00:24:41.738
and much wider sense, but it is impossible for ardent Christians

00:24:41.951 --> 00:24:47.742
to understand that Christ could be this elephant boy.

00:24:47.938 --> 00:24:52.097
That is beyond them, because for them Christ should be a man

00:24:52.278 --> 00:24:56.238
who has no power to kill anyone.

00:24:56.698 --> 00:24:59.937
And then they say that He’s coming to kill us,

00:25:00.119 --> 00:25:03.704
I don’t know how they manage these things.

00:25:05.846 --> 00:25:08.316
They catch hold of one thing,

00:25:08.517 --> 00:25:10.790
like He was the Omega and Alpha, finished;

00:25:10.991 --> 00:25:14.486
now how are they authorized, God knows?

00:25:14.687 --> 00:25:18.087
But whatever it is, they do not see the other things,

00:25:18.288 --> 00:25:21.466
that He had a Mother; He said about the Holy Spirit.

00:25:21.667 --> 00:25:23.711
He said it in such a good way,

00:25:23.912 --> 00:25:27.683
that “I’ll be sending Holy Spirit.” And also He said

00:25:27.884 --> 00:25:31.223
that “Those who are,

00:25:31.424 --> 00:25:34.214
those who have sinned against Me or have insulted Me,

00:25:34.415 --> 00:25:37.164
it’s all right, but with the Holy Spirit nothing will be tolerated”,

00:25:37.365 --> 00:25:41.048
very clearly. Why did He say so?

00:25:41.249 --> 00:25:45.262
He’s Alpha and Omega, but why did He say so?

00:25:45.463 --> 00:25:48.038
Of course, He’s the first who was created,

00:25:48.239 --> 00:25:51.050
and at this stage, at Kalki stage also it is He who,

00:25:51.251 --> 00:25:54.249
He’s there at the end of it, no doubt.

00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:56.340
But that doesn’t mean because you are Christians

00:25:56.541 --> 00:25:59.325
you have a special right.

00:25:59.526 --> 00:26:02.278
Not at all. On the contrary, I would say many Hindus

00:26:02.479 --> 00:26:06.762
have much more right on Ganesha than you have,

00:26:06.963 --> 00:26:11.150
because you have spoilt your innocence.

00:26:11.568 --> 00:26:15.114
They have not spoilt their innocence.

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:17.257
So though you may call yourself Christians,

00:26:17.458 --> 00:26:21.363
Christians and fight for Christ, but you are not;

00:26:21.578 --> 00:26:24.109
because the basics of Christ is innocence,

00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:26.859
which we have ruined.

00:26:27.698 --> 00:26:30.817
So those who – also Sahaja yogis – get identified

00:26:31.018 --> 00:26:34.111
with Christ must know that this identification is actually

00:26:34.312 --> 00:26:36.657
a conditioning;

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:43.114
it is not factually so. If so, you have to become innocent.

00:26:43.399 --> 00:26:45.958
You must re-establish your innocence.

00:26:46.159 --> 00:26:51.481
Then you are really Christians, and then you are really so.

00:26:51.682 --> 00:26:55.097
And I would say people in India – as it is, you know,

00:26:55.298 --> 00:26:59.494
luckily we did not get advanced as you people got.

00:26:59.695 --> 00:27:03.383
We never fall into the traps of advancement, luckily:

00:27:03.584 --> 00:27:06.333
too sluggish, elephant-like people,

00:27:06.534 --> 00:27:09.241
we could not fall into anything.

00:27:09.442 --> 00:27:12.812
India is like, large like an elephant.

00:27:13.013 --> 00:27:15.820
Anything comes in, this just goes on throwing this side,

00:27:16.021 --> 00:27:17.908
that side, that doesn’t accept anything.

00:27:18.109 --> 00:27:20.637
We never bothered about Freud. For us he’s some sort of

00:27:20.838 --> 00:27:23.649
a legendary fellow living in fool’s paradise,

00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:25.803
we never accepted him.

00:27:26.004 --> 00:27:29.182
Nothing can penetrate that elephantine thing.

00:27:29.383 --> 00:27:33.622
You see, it just goes on blowing off all the things that comes round,

00:27:33.818 --> 00:27:35.982
so nothing got into their heads.

00:27:36.183 --> 00:27:38.017
They never spoiled their innocence,

00:27:38.218 --> 00:27:41.577
simply because they are too large and very lethargic

00:27:41.778 --> 00:27:44.538
to new ideas.

00:27:45.497 --> 00:27:48.722
And that’s how they have, despite everything

00:27:48.938 --> 00:27:50.797
they are not converted Christians,

00:27:50.998 --> 00:27:52.822
they never heard of Christ, some of them.

00:27:53.023 --> 00:27:56.178
They have maintained their innocence much more

00:27:56.392 --> 00:27:58.870
and their sincerity of their heart,

00:27:59.071 --> 00:28:01.560
because they are not disconnected.

00:28:01.778 --> 00:28:03.897
When Ganesha is destroyed you get disconnected.

00:28:04.081 --> 00:28:08.046
Your heart works on one side, your brain works on another side.

00:28:08.247 --> 00:28:10.977
So, that they have not been able to yet achieve,

00:28:11.178 --> 00:28:14.178
that kind of a dissociation. And whatever they may try,

00:28:14.379 --> 00:28:16.923
they know in their – that it is wrong.

00:28:17.124 --> 00:28:18.921
They may try, I mean, like people steal

00:28:19.122 --> 00:28:23.124
but they know it is wrong; in the same way they still know.

00:28:23.325 --> 00:28:28.667
So for us, we must know that we have to achieve

00:28:28.868 --> 00:28:35.391
our position as innocent people.

00:28:35.645 --> 00:28:38.941
But your Mother is very gracious,

00:28:39.142 --> 00:28:42.746
She’s very powerful, She’s very loving,

00:28:42.947 --> 00:28:49.790
and She has created you on the same pattern as Ganesha.

00:28:50.013 --> 00:28:53.237
You have all the powers that Shri Ganesha has.

00:28:53.438 --> 00:28:55.985
The greatest power that Shri Ganesha has,

00:28:56.186 --> 00:28:59.936
that you can come so close to Me.

00:29:00.801 --> 00:29:05.801
No other gods can come that close to Me as you can come.

00:29:08.916 --> 00:29:14.166
Kundalini cannot be risen by any gods, any incarnations

00:29:14.367 --> 00:29:17.421
but Shri Ganesha.

00:29:18.293 --> 00:29:24.152
He has to inform the kundalini, otherwise kundalini cannot rise.

00:29:24.498 --> 00:29:28.907
And it is you who have the power to raise the kundalini

00:29:29.108 --> 00:29:31.538
on your fingers. How many powers I have given you.

00:29:31.755 --> 00:29:34.959
you have no idea at all.

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:41.199
I have made you in the pattern of Shri Ganesh.

00:29:42.051 --> 00:29:45.158
So you have to establish that innocence within you;

00:29:45.359 --> 00:29:47.811
that is being also established.

00:29:48.012 --> 00:29:50.502
You’ll get back your innocence.

00:29:50.703 --> 00:29:54.599
But the second thing which is so important about Shri Ganesh

00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:56.165
one has to learn, that

00:29:56.366 --> 00:30:00.649
He does not know any other god but His Mother.

00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:04.803
For Him nothing exists but His Mother.

00:30:05.512 --> 00:30:07.593
He’s so dedicated.

00:30:07.794 --> 00:30:12.159
There’s a story once when Parvati,

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:16.039
His Mother gave –

00:30:17.609 --> 00:30:21.333
said that “I will give You a big present,

00:30:21.534 --> 00:30:24.380
that there should be competition between You two brothers.”

00:30:24.581 --> 00:30:28.545
Second was the Kartikeya, the one, another brother of His

00:30:28.746 --> 00:30:32.847
who came on this Earth just to destroy this Narakasura.

00:30:33.048 --> 00:30:35.947
Is the, all the destructive powers

00:30:36.148 --> 00:30:38.896
were combined to create Kartikeya.

00:30:39.097 --> 00:30:44.594
So She said, “Whosoever goes round this Earth,

00:30:44.795 --> 00:30:47.638
I’ll give You a prize.”

00:30:48.438 --> 00:30:53.752
So, the conveyance of

00:30:53.953 --> 00:30:57.360
Kartikeya is such a fast one, is a peacock.

00:30:57.561 --> 00:31:01.943
So He got onto His peacock, started flying out like an aeroplane.

00:31:02.237 --> 00:31:07.423
And Shri Ganesha’s conveyance is just a little mouse,

00:31:07.624 --> 00:31:10.842
so what should He do? He took to wisdom.

00:31:11.043 --> 00:31:14.988
He said, “Who can be greater than My Mother?

00:31:15.693 --> 00:31:17.977
She has created all the gods.

00:31:18.178 --> 00:31:21.270
She’s the Mahakali, She’s the Adi Shakti.

00:31:21.471 --> 00:31:24.123
She has created all the gods, She has created all the universes,

00:31:24.324 --> 00:31:27.307
She’s the one who has done everything, who can be greater than Her?

00:31:27.508 --> 00:31:31.665
She’s the greatest of all.” So she just, He just went round Her

00:31:31.866 --> 00:31:34.719
only thrice and He got the prize.

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:39.177
And still He was flying in the air, Kartikeya.

00:31:39.474 --> 00:31:42.802
He fought even Shiva.

00:31:43.104 --> 00:31:45.947
He fought everyone.

00:31:46.184 --> 00:31:49.417
It’s a very interesting story how all that happened,

00:31:49.618 --> 00:31:53.407
that shows complete dedication.

00:31:53.608 --> 00:31:55.732
And for Sahaja yogis

00:31:55.933 --> 00:32:01.379
it is important to understand complete surrendering, dedication,

00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:07.853
and also a genuine feeling from the heart.

00:32:10.025 --> 00:32:13.731
I will ask Raul Bai sometimes to talk to you about the protocol,

00:32:13.932 --> 00:32:17.299
that’s important, though I am so close.

00:32:17.703 --> 00:32:23.220
Even Christ would not say anything;

00:32:23.421 --> 00:32:28.569
sometimes the way you people talk to Me, I am amazed.

00:32:29.105 --> 00:32:31.188
Certain things you say to Me, I’m amazed:

00:32:31.389 --> 00:32:36.064
how can you say these things to Me, knowingly what I am?

00:32:36.265 --> 00:32:39.304
But you forget.

00:32:39.547 --> 00:32:45.191
So it is important to understand that they were great

00:32:45.392 --> 00:32:50.289
because they knew the greatness of their Mother.

00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:53.850
In the same way, you all have to learn certain protocols

00:32:54.051 --> 00:32:56.488
which Raul Bai will teach you,

00:32:56.689 --> 00:33:00.501
so that you do not make any mistakes

00:33:00.702 --> 00:33:03.496
of saying things which are not proper.

00:33:03.697 --> 00:33:05.822
It comes from bad Vishuddhi, no doubt,

00:33:06.023 --> 00:33:08.963
but consciously if you work it out

00:33:09.164 --> 00:33:12.359
you will do good to yourself; because you know,

00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:15.373
anything against the Holy Spirit won’t be tolerated,

00:33:15.574 --> 00:33:19.472
anything, can you believe it?

00:33:19.969 --> 00:33:23.995
What strong words these are! Just think of it,

00:33:24.196 --> 00:33:28.188
anything against the Holy Spirit.

00:33:30.138 --> 00:33:32.559
So one has to understand the protocol, for Sahaja yogis,

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:37.538
for Sahaja yogis, don’t talk against the Holy Spirit.

00:33:37.758 --> 00:33:40.996
But the protocol is there which one must understand,

00:33:41.197 --> 00:33:44.365
and how far to go, how far to understand

00:33:44.578 --> 00:33:50.292
is very, very, absolutely rudimentary for Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:53.267
So today we have a great day

00:33:53.468 --> 00:34:01.038
of Shri Ganesha’s Mother being established, incarnated.

00:34:01.239 --> 00:34:05.264
Today is the day She had Her bath, we can say,

00:34:05.465 --> 00:34:08.734
and that’s why I said I’ll come and have a bath here.

00:34:08.935 --> 00:34:10.935
About the times and timings,

00:34:11.136 --> 00:34:13.971
one should know that Mother knows best,

00:34:14.172 --> 00:34:17.759
and everything works out with the timing properly.

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:23.413
Because the, you know you are, you are ahead of India,

00:34:24.374 --> 00:34:28.286
and all the timings work out in that way.

00:34:28.487 --> 00:34:32.069
So everything has to work in the way,

00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:34.694
actually the timings are of the moon,

00:34:34.895 --> 00:34:37.470
so you don’t have to worry about what is the timing,

00:34:37.671 --> 00:34:39.552
what time this works out, this thing, that.

00:34:39.753 --> 00:34:42.162
The watches and all that, in Sahaja Yoga,

00:34:42.363 --> 00:34:46.809
work out according to My understanding.

00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:51.698
So one has to relax and just enjoy the puja.

00:34:51.899 --> 00:34:55.024
I think today you are going to receive lots of vibrations.

00:34:55.225 --> 00:34:57.393
Just enjoy them, just enjoy them.

00:34:57.594 --> 00:35:00.389
And if your ego is there or anything,

00:35:00.590 --> 00:35:04.152
just ask them to shut up, that’s all.

00:35:06.088 --> 00:35:07.496
All right?

00:35:07.697 --> 00:35:11.567
Now, so first we’ll have Ganesha Puja,

00:35:11.768 --> 00:35:13.436
as Modi will be doing,

00:35:13.637 --> 00:35:17.797
and he will be explaining what is to be done.

00:35:17.998 --> 00:35:22.013
How Ganesha is pleased with small, small things you will see now.

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:29.714
[Hindi]

00:35:31.494 --> 00:35:34.968
Who will come for the – children should come for the puja?

00:35:35.169 --> 00:35:39.165
Let all the children come for the puja.
