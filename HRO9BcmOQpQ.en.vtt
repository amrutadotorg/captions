00:12.651 --> 00:16.650
Shri Ganesha Gauri Puja

00:16.851 --> 00:20.843
Sydney, Australia

00:21.044 --> 00:24.837
April 4, 1981

01:36.947 --> 01:41.179
Today is a very unique thing that is happened,

01:41.380 --> 01:48.222
is a special luck for Sahaja yogis of Australia.

01:49.399 --> 01:52.110
This day has never been celebrated before

01:52.311 --> 01:54.866
in the history of Sahaja Yoga.

01:55.067 --> 01:59.272
Today is the New Year’s Day for Sahaja yogis,

01:59.473 --> 02:06.747
because this is the New Year’s Day

02:06.948 --> 02:09.750
of the Shalivahan calendar.

02:09.951 --> 02:14.243
As you know, Shalivahan is My dynasty,

02:14.444 --> 02:16.768
and they are called as Shalivahan

02:16.969 --> 02:19.598
because they are the carriers of the shawls of the Goddess,

02:19.799 --> 02:22.724
they are called as the, because as you are also carrying

02:22.938 --> 02:26.697
so many times My shawls around.

02:27.199 --> 02:29.203
And they were called as Shalivahan.

02:29.404 --> 02:38.119
So this New Year’s Day is the first day of advent of Goddess,

02:38.320 --> 02:41.324
the nine days there are.

02:41.757 --> 02:49.814
Then in another times that there are Satya Yug,

02:50.015 --> 02:55.130
then there’s Dvapara, Treta, Kali Yuga: there are four yugas.

02:55.331 --> 02:59.792
So in two yugas the Goddess incarnated,

02:59.978 --> 03:04.146
one before the Satya Yuga and one after it.

03:04.886 --> 03:11.075
So today is the day to mark absolutely the first day

03:11.276 --> 03:15.596
when She incarnated on this Earth.

03:16.255 --> 03:19.848
That’s the day also of the Gauri,

03:20.049 --> 03:24.869
because Virgin is the first form of the Goddess.

03:26.001 --> 03:39.523
And She created also Ganesha on Tuesday,

03:39.724 --> 03:42.919
just starting this week.

03:43.489 --> 03:45.723
What is the day? The day today is …?

03:45.924 --> 03:47.178
[Today’s the fourth.]

03:47.379 --> 03:48.379
Today ….

03:48.580 --> 03:51.021
[Saturday, Mother.]

03:51.792 --> 03:53.740
[Saturday.]

03:53.941 --> 03:57.969
Saturday. Now, now, it’s over. Now don’t stay, all right?

03:58.170 --> 04:00.375
While I’m speaking you should not take My photographs.

04:00.576 --> 04:03.287
It’s a very wrong idea, because it disturbs Me.

04:03.488 --> 04:06.255
Moreover, you see, when the speaking, while I’m speaking

04:06.456 --> 04:07.590
and when you take My photograph

04:07.791 --> 04:10.454
sometimes I’ve seen they come out very odd.

04:10.655 --> 04:12.820
Best take photographs when I’m not speaking, you see,

04:13.021 --> 04:16.496
because all the time the sound is coming, everybody is distracted

04:16.697 --> 04:18.809
and the attention doesn’t fix, you see.

04:19.010 --> 04:21.245
Is a very important thing I’m talking, all right?

04:21.446 --> 04:24.456
Now don’t take any photographs, please.

04:24.657 --> 04:27.813
Pay attention to what I’m saying.

04:28.208 --> 04:31.114
[Hindi]

04:39.695 --> 04:45.579
So Tuesday is the day when Ganesha was established,

04:45.780 --> 04:52.254
and then the Goddess started working.

04:52.455 --> 04:58.392
The first one, the one day when She started is, was the Wednesday.

04:58.593 --> 05:01.237
She started working out on Wednesday.

05:01.438 --> 05:04.316
Wednesday is the action day,

05:04.517 --> 05:07.107
that’s why she started on Wednesday.

05:07.308 --> 05:11.484
Today is, under the circumstances it is Saturday;

05:11.685 --> 05:16.052
but I’m telling you about the original timings.

05:18.477 --> 05:22.864
Because Wednesday is the day of the Swadisthana,

05:23.065 --> 05:27.588
that’s the day She started working it out, the whole thing.

05:27.897 --> 05:32.193
So first, Tuesday is the first day in Sahaja Yoga,

05:32.394 --> 05:34.986
Wednesday is the second day.

05:35.187 --> 05:39.919
And you’ll be surprised that the stars are also the same,

05:40.120 --> 05:44.571
because Tuesday is the day of the Mars

05:44.772 --> 05:49.389
which is resided by Shri Ganesh.

05:49.590 --> 05:56.655
Wednesday is the day of Mercury, and Mercury is the Swadisthana.

05:57.358 --> 06:07.667
Third day – yes – third day is the day of Jupiter:

06:07.868 --> 06:11.157
what you call, we call it guru, is the day of the guru,

06:11.358 --> 06:14.873
is the Jupiter, is the teacher.

06:17.186 --> 06:20.275
Now, Friday is the day of the Goddess.

06:20.476 --> 06:23.814
Now see the chakras also, of the Goddess,

06:24.015 --> 06:27.103
Mother of the Earth, Mother of the Universe,

06:27.304 --> 06:29.546
Venus.

06:31.008 --> 06:35.111
But in Indian Sanskrit language the names of the days

06:35.312 --> 06:40.577
are exactly the same, tallying with the stars,

06:42.128 --> 06:48.713
Then Saturday is the day of Shri Krishna, Shani, is Saturn.

06:52.675 --> 06:57.206
Then Sunday is the day of Christ, the Sun.

06:59.008 --> 07:03.863
Monday is the day of Sadashiva,

07:04.064 --> 07:07.665
is of realization, of integration.

07:08.299 --> 07:13.033
These are the seven days when God created the whole universe.

07:16.012 --> 07:18.468
That’s what I told yesterday, that in this narrow way

07:18.669 --> 07:20.875
you cannot understand Christianity.

07:21.076 --> 07:24.888
You’ll think it’s all mad, which is not.

07:25.089 --> 07:27.928
Only when you read other things, other scriptures,

07:28.129 --> 07:32.324
then only you will understand what Christ said.

07:32.759 --> 07:37.605
So today is the day of – first day –

07:37.806 --> 07:40.264
of when Ganesha was created,

07:40.465 --> 07:47.600
in the sense that, though today is not a Tuesday,

07:47.801 --> 07:53.403
but according to dates of the moon,

07:53.604 --> 08:01.225
today is the day, first day of the moon in this month.

08:01.787 --> 08:02.961
[Marathi]

08:03.162 --> 08:07.036
Chaitra. We call it Chaitra. Chaitra is the month.

08:07.237 --> 08:08.970
And this is the time when –

08:09.171 --> 08:12.651
[Marathi]

08:18.064 --> 08:19.656
Gauri is the Chaitra.

08:19.857 --> 08:22.074
So the establishment of the Gauri

08:22.275 --> 08:24.962
is taken place during these nine days.

08:25.163 --> 08:29.097
But Ganesha has to be established before anything else.

08:29.298 --> 08:31.626
Though first Gauri had to come,

08:31.827 --> 08:37.225
you can see that. Gauri had to come first to establish Ganesha.

08:37.426 --> 08:41.467
But Ganesha is always put before even Gauri.

08:41.668 --> 08:48.016
Before the pujana of the, worship of the Ganesha,

08:48.217 --> 08:50.003
nothing starts;

08:50.204 --> 08:53.369
because He’s the one who takes out all the obstacles,

08:53.570 --> 08:56.339
all the negativities,

08:56.540 --> 08:59.049
all the hurdles that are going to come up,

08:59.250 --> 09:03.992
all the attentions that are here and there.

09:04.193 --> 09:06.728
So that’s why we first worship Ganesha,

09:06.929 --> 09:09.684
just to ask Him to protect us.

09:09.885 --> 09:11.647
But first the Gauri has to come,

09:11.848 --> 09:16.694
and that’s how the Gauri is this nine days.

09:16.895 --> 09:23.827
She came on this Earth to fight the devils and demons,

09:24.028 --> 09:31.897
negativity, for people to transcend

09:32.098 --> 09:36.695
the Bhavasagara, the Void,

09:36.896 --> 09:40.465
the maya, the illusion.

09:40.666 --> 09:44.914
When they were praying, when they were doing anything,

09:45.115 --> 09:47.799
people used to obstruct

09:48.000 --> 09:53.147
and then they troubled the bhaktas, the devotees of God.

09:53.348 --> 09:59.689
Rakshasas, in those days the rakshasas were separate

09:59.890 --> 10:02.575
and the saints were separate;

10:02.776 --> 10:05.573
there was not such a mixture as it is today.

10:05.774 --> 10:09.054
We find in saints there are negativities sitting there.

10:09.255 --> 10:12.437
Was never so before. This is Kali Yuga.

10:12.638 --> 10:15.476
It’s such a confusion that there is no absolute saint

10:15.677 --> 10:18.070
or there’s no absolute rakshasas.

10:18.271 --> 10:21.486
These rakshasas have come and sitting in our heads.

10:21.687 --> 10:24.332
They are within us, so the negativity is there,

10:24.533 --> 10:27.154
so we are not absolute saints.

10:27.355 --> 10:30.609
And this is the big problem of Sahaja Yoga is, that

10:30.810 --> 10:32.873
even when you are worshipping Me,

10:33.074 --> 10:37.244
try to be more on the saints than on the negative side.

10:37.445 --> 10:40.690
Try to be more on the saintly side.

10:40.891 --> 10:43.170
Because you are saints, no doubt,

10:43.371 --> 10:47.114
but these horrible things have somehow or other

10:47.315 --> 10:49.723
gone into your heads and they are sitting in

10:49.924 --> 10:53.633
your superego and ego, these horrible negativities,

10:53.834 --> 10:57.664
which you must really decide today to throw them away.

10:57.865 --> 11:03.117
Because you are really saints and these are the bad spots,

11:03.318 --> 11:05.477
kalanka.

11:05.678 --> 11:08.897
Is the thing that really ruins you, is within you.

11:09.098 --> 11:13.008
So try to throw it away; try to become positive,

11:13.209 --> 11:15.783
be one with the puja.

11:15.984 --> 11:23.112
The second thing is the importance of this day is,

11:23.313 --> 11:29.626
that I have never celebrated this first day anywhere, so far.

11:30.774 --> 11:33.776
It was to be in Australia.

11:33.977 --> 11:37.770
It is the right of Australia to have this day here,

11:37.971 --> 11:40.611
celebrated here.

11:47.400 --> 11:51.595
We had other pujas, other Navaratris we had;

11:51.796 --> 11:54.113
with that I celebrated the first, second, third,

11:54.314 --> 11:55.970
over nine days we have done.

11:56.171 --> 11:58.163
But never this Navaratri as such

11:58.364 --> 12:02.313
we have celebrated this day anywhere, of the Shalivahana.

12:02.514 --> 12:06.323
Though in London they had a little sort of a thing on this, which I,

12:06.524 --> 12:10.309
we had on the seventh of April, then I spoke about it;

12:10.510 --> 12:15.867
but actually on this day we had no puja, before.

12:16.068 --> 12:22.513
So, this is very creditable that it should happen here.

12:22.714 --> 12:29.676
I’m very happy, because this is where Gauri established Shri Ganesh.

12:36.904 --> 12:41.454
Now for today we have two things to be worshipped:

12:41.655 --> 12:48.803
one, Ganesha, because Ganesha can preserve our status,

12:49.008 --> 12:52.654
our heights,

12:52.855 --> 12:54.631
in our realization.

12:54.832 --> 12:57.798
He protects us when we are getting our realization,

12:57.999 --> 13:00.068
we are rising high;

13:00.269 --> 13:03.653
so He preserves and He protects.

13:03.854 --> 13:10.667
And He looks after us and gives us wisdom,

13:10.868 --> 13:16.614
to have our ascent in such a way

13:16.815 --> 13:21.123
that we do not deviate into the left and the right side;

13:21.324 --> 13:24.139
we have full dignity;

13:24.340 --> 13:30.036
and that we are fully integrated with our heart,

13:30.237 --> 13:33.584
with Shiva Tattwa, with our realization,

13:33.785 --> 13:37.010
and do it with our heart genuinely.

13:37.211 --> 13:40.953
That’s why we worship Shri Ganesh.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.474
But today is actually the puja of the Gauri,

13:45.675 --> 13:47.982
that is, the Kundalini.

13:48.183 --> 13:51.518
So Shri Ganesh we’ll do first of all,

13:51.738 --> 13:55.657
and then we’ll worship the Kundalini, which is the Gauri.

13:55.883 --> 14:01.611
Now luckily I got a sari: this is really remarkable,

14:01.812 --> 14:05.346
because this is the color of Australia.

14:05.547 --> 14:09.642
Green is the color of the Gauri. Gauri wears the green sari.

14:09.843 --> 14:13.636
And there is also – this is the, this is the,

14:13.837 --> 14:17.350
this is the symbol of Gauri only.

14:17.551 --> 14:22.902
This is the symbol of Gauri, and this one inside is the Ganesha,

14:23.103 --> 14:26.483
is in that color, is most surprising this sari I got.

14:26.684 --> 14:28.670
So this one also is just the other way round,

14:28.871 --> 14:32.730
more of Ganesha color and less of the Gauri color.

14:32.931 --> 14:36.825
This is a very traditional combination

14:37.026 --> 14:42.276
in the Indian color scheme, because red is the color of Ganesha.

14:44.203 --> 14:50.519
In you people it is very red and it can become more crimson,

14:50.720 --> 14:52.957
can become absolutely black,

14:53.158 --> 14:57.070
can be absolutely reduced to nothing.

14:57.271 --> 15:06.720
But in Me it is the color of this clay,

15:06.921 --> 15:10.285
because it’s absolutely obedient, it’s absolutely one with Me,

15:10.486 --> 15:15.509
so it’s the color of the clay. And the Gauri is the Mother Earth.

15:16.571 --> 15:21.470
That’s the place where the Gauri exists, in the Mother Earth;

15:21.671 --> 15:23.813
and that’s why the color is green

15:24.014 --> 15:27.053
because Mother Earth is always covered with green,

15:27.254 --> 15:30.508
at least She’s covered with.

15:30.789 --> 15:34.579
And Ganesha’s color is that of the clay

15:34.780 --> 15:37.453
because He’s made out of the Mother Earth,

15:37.654 --> 15:40.739
element is the Mother Earth.

15:41.936 --> 15:47.865
I hope I have been able to explain to you the symbolic relationship.

15:48.679 --> 15:52.634
Do you know the story how Ganesha was created by Gauri?

15:52.835 --> 15:55.578
So that I will tell you; and then we all can have.

15:55.779 --> 16:00.864
It’s very interesting, that’s why I said I’ll have My bath here.

16:02.073 --> 16:03.073
It is said this ….

16:03.274 --> 16:06.702
[Excuse me, Mother, we can’t hear very well down the back.]

16:06.903 --> 16:09.382
[Is there any way You can speak louder or that we can hear better?]

16:09.583 --> 16:10.442
What’s she say?

16:10.643 --> 16:11.536
[They cannot hear.]

16:11.737 --> 16:12.962
You can’t hear Me?e …]

16:13.163 --> 16:14.163
[Yogini: No, Mother.]

16:14.378 --> 16:18.112
All right, so I’ll have to shout.

16:18.927 --> 16:19.989
Not at all?

16:20.190 --> 16:21.540
[Yogini: Yes, a little, most of the time...]

16:21.741 --> 16:24.458
All right. Should I use this?

16:26.124 --> 16:29.030
All right. This you can hear.

16:31.834 --> 16:37.259
So I’m now going to tell you

16:37.460 --> 16:40.405
the story of Shri Ganesha’s birth.

16:40.606 --> 16:44.972
Is very interesting, it’s very symbolic. This is Christ, and that is,

16:45.173 --> 16:49.317
He is the Omega and He is the Alpha and all that they talk of,

16:49.518 --> 16:51.765
they don’t know what they are talking.

16:51.966 --> 16:55.558
There’s so short form of what the whole thing is.

16:55.759 --> 16:58.188
They don’t know Ganesha at all, nothing.

16:58.389 --> 17:03.599
They just take one word here and there, just talk like that.

17:05.018 --> 17:09.125
So He’s the first one created.

17:09.778 --> 17:12.506
Now it’s very symbolic:

17:12.707 --> 17:15.779
the pure power

17:15.980 --> 17:23.480
of desire to be one with the spirit is symbolized in the Gauri.

17:23.681 --> 17:28.286
The primordial Gauri is that power

17:28.487 --> 17:32.461
which has separated from Her Lord,

17:32.658 --> 17:35.486
we can say.

17:36.405 --> 17:39.959
In Her previous lives She was separated,

17:40.160 --> 17:43.822
and again She’s born as Parvati.

17:44.023 --> 17:49.491
And She wants to be one with Shiva, which is the Spirit.

17:51.089 --> 17:53.824
So now the marriage has taken place,

17:54.025 --> 17:57.758
in the sense that now She can meet Him.

17:57.959 --> 18:01.404
The wedding kindling has to start.

18:02.138 --> 18:03.784
But She’s not yet married,

18:03.985 --> 18:05.870
in the sense that She’s still a Virgin,

18:06.071 --> 18:14.315
but married otherwise – means She is now about to rise.

18:14.791 --> 18:18.742
Before that She wants to have a bath,

18:18.943 --> 18:21.883
because She has to meet Her Lord.

18:22.084 --> 18:25.632
So She must have Her bath, the bridal bath.

18:25.833 --> 18:30.997
She’s a virgin, absolutely virgin, and She goes for Her bath.

18:32.053 --> 18:34.953
Now, She’s afraid that anybody might come inside

18:35.154 --> 18:38.075
when She’s having Her bath.

18:38.985 --> 18:41.244
Look at the delicacy of the whole thing:

18:41.445 --> 18:46.154
this desire, which just is meant for the spirit,

18:46.355 --> 18:48.632
doesn’t want to be exposed to anything else,

18:48.833 --> 18:52.450
any negativity coming in, anything happening like that.

18:53.239 --> 18:56.545
So She closes the door,

18:56.746 --> 19:01.597
but still She’s worried from the back side somebody may come.

19:02.099 --> 19:12.846
So She puts this scented powder, which we use in India,

19:13.047 --> 19:16.329
for the bride specially it is the right one,

19:16.530 --> 19:19.283
and rubs Her body with that, and She finds

19:19.484 --> 19:22.693
that a lot of it comes out. So She makes the Ganesha out of that,

19:22.894 --> 19:27.151
now imagine how much vibrated it must be.

19:30.693 --> 19:33.687
She puts that – is made of camphor

19:33.888 --> 19:37.859
and all these beautiful things which are really celestial –

19:38.060 --> 19:42.599
and that is completely vibrated on Her body.

19:42.800 --> 19:48.339
She makes a Ganesha and puts Him to the back of the bathroom;

19:48.904 --> 19:51.571
She’s having Her bath nicely.

19:51.772 --> 19:56.869
At that time Shiva comes suddenly, knocks at the door.

19:57.070 --> 19:59.421
She doesn’t hear Him.

19:59.622 --> 20:05.504
So He goes from the back door. There
He sees Shri Ganesha sitting.

20:06.443 --> 20:08.787
He asks Shri Ganesha, “Who are You?”

20:08.978 --> 20:13.577
So He says, “I am the Son of Gauri.”

20:13.791 --> 20:16.538
Shiva can’t understand; She is a Virgin

20:16.739 --> 20:19.602
and this one is saying, “I am the Son of the Gauri.”

20:19.803 --> 20:23.672
See now the Immaculate Conception,

20:23.873 --> 20:26.191
try to understand.

20:26.392 --> 20:34.338
So Shiva says, “How can She have a child? She is the Virgin.”

20:34.539 --> 20:39.341
And He thinks [She’s] He’s bringing slander on His wife who is a Virgin.

20:39.542 --> 20:44.053
So He cuts His neck in anger,

20:44.254 --> 20:46.856
and He enters into the bathroom.

20:47.058 --> 20:50.937
And Gauri is ready to receive Him.

20:51.144 --> 20:55.083
And She looks out and She sees Her child is dead.

20:55.284 --> 21:00.088
So He asked Her, “What is this?”

21:00.289 --> 21:05.017
Said, “That’s My child I created out of My, this mala” –

21:05.218 --> 21:08.255
what you call this, all the body things that came out –

21:08.456 --> 21:12.134
“I’ve created Him, and I have put Him down there.

21:12.335 --> 21:15.163
How dare You kill Him?”

21:15.458 --> 21:17.552
She said, “ Now what to do?”

21:17.753 --> 21:20.364
He said, “All right, what You do is to go

21:20.565 --> 21:28.129
and find the head of any animal that is available,

21:28.330 --> 21:32.481
and we will put that on this trunk

21:32.698 --> 21:36.297
and He’ll be My son again.”

21:36.498 --> 21:40.657
Now it’s all prearranged;

21:40.865 --> 21:44.776
because this child was not to grow into

21:44.977 --> 21:47.859
a human ego and superego business.

21:48.060 --> 21:52.231
It had to be the embodiment of childhood,

21:52.432 --> 21:57.767
embodiment of childlike innocence,

21:57.968 --> 22:01.016
because He’s the embodiment of innocence.

22:01.217 --> 22:04.778
So they had to get the head of an animal.

22:04.979 --> 22:13.904
Now the wisest animal on this Earth is elephant,

22:14.105 --> 22:17.676
and elephant was saved in evolution in a very miraculous way,

22:17.877 --> 22:21.603
is also another description which I’ll give you later on.

22:21.987 --> 22:25.721
So a she-elephant, mother elephant

22:25.922 --> 22:29.805
was lying down with her back towards her child,

22:30.006 --> 22:33.553
that’s why in India women never sleep with their back

22:33.754 --> 22:35.897
towards their children, never.

22:36.098 --> 22:39.734
The child has to be in front, pudhe, in front.

22:39.935 --> 22:43.227
It should never be put at the back of the mother, never.

22:43.428 --> 22:46.948
Mother will get up and go on the other side and change the sides,

22:47.149 --> 22:49.717
but she would never put the child at the back.

22:49.918 --> 22:53.613
So the head of that little animal was cut,

22:53.814 --> 22:57.832
and He brought it and was put for Shri Ganesh.

22:58.033 --> 23:01.829
And that’s how Shri Ganesha was created.

23:02.030 --> 23:11.411
But you know, elephant is the conveyance of Mahalakshmi.

23:12.677 --> 23:17.363
So the body is from Mahakali,

23:17.564 --> 23:23.064
but the head is given by Mahalakshmi, the evolutionary power.

23:27.230 --> 23:35.127
Now this Ganesha within us resides

23:35.328 --> 23:38.328
in the Mooladhara Chakra.

23:38.937 --> 23:43.633
Some people who tried all kinds of tricks to find God

23:43.834 --> 23:50.154
must have seen the trunk of Shri Ganesha,

23:50.355 --> 23:52.965
and must have thought this is the kundalini,

23:53.166 --> 23:56.632
because as a Mother I give them few marks for that,

23:56.818 --> 23:59.411
and that’s how they started all these perversions

23:59.612 --> 24:02.058
and wrong things about Ganesha.

24:02.274 --> 24:05.841
But He is embodiment of innocence,

24:06.042 --> 24:10.449
and later on you must read in “Devi Bhagwat”

24:10.658 --> 24:16.657
how He incarnated on this Earth as Christ;

24:16.862 --> 24:20.769
and how He is going to come with His eleven powers

24:20.970 --> 24:23.744
on this Earth as Kalki.

24:23.945 --> 24:26.587
It is very difficult for Hindus to accept that Ganesha,

24:26.788 --> 24:28.752
such a dynamic personality like Him,

24:28.953 --> 24:32.403
should become a person like Christ, who got Himself crucified.

24:32.618 --> 24:34.323
And it is impossible,

24:34.524 --> 24:36.552
at least Hindus have much wider knowledge

24:36.753 --> 24:41.738
and much wider sense, but it is impossible for ardent Christians

24:41.951 --> 24:47.742
to understand that Christ could be this elephant boy.

24:47.938 --> 24:52.097
That is beyond them, because for them Christ should be a man

24:52.278 --> 24:56.238
who has no power to kill anyone.

24:56.698 --> 24:59.937
And then they say that He’s coming to kill us,

25:00.119 --> 25:03.704
I don’t know how they manage these things.

25:05.846 --> 25:08.316
They catch hold of one thing,

25:08.517 --> 25:10.790
like He was the Omega and Alpha, finished;

25:10.991 --> 25:14.486
now how are they authorized, God knows?

25:14.687 --> 25:18.087
But whatever it is, they do not see the other things,

25:18.288 --> 25:21.466
that He had a Mother; He said about the Holy Spirit.

25:21.667 --> 25:23.711
He said it in such a good way,

25:23.912 --> 25:27.683
that “I’ll be sending Holy Spirit.” And also He said

25:27.884 --> 25:31.223
that “Those who are,

25:31.424 --> 25:34.214
those who have sinned against Me or have insulted Me,

25:34.415 --> 25:37.164
it’s all right, but with the Holy Spirit nothing will be tolerated”,

25:37.365 --> 25:41.048
very clearly. Why did He say so?

25:41.249 --> 25:45.262
He’s Alpha and Omega, but why did He say so?

25:45.463 --> 25:48.038
Of course, He’s the first who was created,

25:48.239 --> 25:51.050
and at this stage, at Kalki stage also it is He who,

25:51.251 --> 25:54.249
He’s there at the end of it, no doubt.

25:54.450 --> 25:56.340
But that doesn’t mean because you are Christians

25:56.541 --> 25:59.325
you have a special right.

25:59.526 --> 26:02.278
Not at all. On the contrary, I would say many Hindus

26:02.479 --> 26:06.762
have much more right on Ganesha than you have,

26:06.963 --> 26:11.150
because you have spoilt your innocence.

26:11.568 --> 26:15.114
They have not spoilt their innocence.

26:15.570 --> 26:17.257
So though you may call yourself Christians,

26:17.458 --> 26:21.363
Christians and fight for Christ, but you are not;

26:21.578 --> 26:24.109
because the basics of Christ is innocence,

26:24.310 --> 26:26.859
which we have ruined.

26:27.698 --> 26:30.817
So those who – also Sahaja yogis – get identified

26:31.018 --> 26:34.111
with Christ must know that this identification is actually

26:34.312 --> 26:36.657
a conditioning;

26:36.880 --> 26:43.114
it is not factually so. If so, you have to become innocent.

26:43.399 --> 26:45.958
You must re-establish your innocence.

26:46.159 --> 26:51.481
Then you are really Christians, and then you are really so.

26:51.682 --> 26:55.097
And I would say people in India – as it is, you know,

26:55.298 --> 26:59.494
luckily we did not get advanced as you people got.

26:59.695 --> 27:03.383
We never fall into the traps of advancement, luckily:

27:03.584 --> 27:06.333
too sluggish, elephant-like people,

27:06.534 --> 27:09.241
we could not fall into anything.

27:09.442 --> 27:12.812
India is like, large like an elephant.

27:13.013 --> 27:15.820
Anything comes in, this just goes on throwing this side,

27:16.021 --> 27:17.908
that side, that doesn’t accept anything.

27:18.109 --> 27:20.637
We never bothered about Freud. For us he’s some sort of

27:20.838 --> 27:23.649
a legendary fellow living in fool’s paradise,

27:23.850 --> 27:25.803
we never accepted him.

27:26.004 --> 27:29.182
Nothing can penetrate that elephantine thing.

27:29.383 --> 27:33.622
You see, it just goes on blowing off all the things that comes round,

27:33.818 --> 27:35.982
so nothing got into their heads.

27:36.183 --> 27:38.017
They never spoiled their innocence,

27:38.218 --> 27:41.577
simply because they are too large and very lethargic

27:41.778 --> 27:44.538
to new ideas.

27:45.497 --> 27:48.722
And that’s how they have, despite everything

27:48.938 --> 27:50.797
they are not converted Christians,

27:50.998 --> 27:52.822
they never heard of Christ, some of them.

27:53.023 --> 27:56.178
They have maintained their innocence much more

27:56.392 --> 27:58.870
and their sincerity of their heart,

27:59.071 --> 28:01.560
because they are not disconnected.

28:01.778 --> 28:03.897
When Ganesha is destroyed you get disconnected.

28:04.081 --> 28:08.046
Your heart works on one side, your brain works on another side.

28:08.247 --> 28:10.977
So, that they have not been able to yet achieve,

28:11.178 --> 28:14.178
that kind of a dissociation. And whatever they may try,

28:14.379 --> 28:16.923
they know in their – that it is wrong.

28:17.124 --> 28:18.921
They may try, I mean, like people steal

28:19.122 --> 28:23.124
but they know it is wrong; in the same way they still know.

28:23.325 --> 28:28.667
So for us, we must know that we have to achieve

28:28.868 --> 28:35.391
our position as innocent people.

28:35.645 --> 28:38.941
But your Mother is very gracious,

28:39.142 --> 28:42.746
She’s very powerful, She’s very loving,

28:42.947 --> 28:49.790
and She has created you on the same pattern as Ganesha.

28:50.013 --> 28:53.237
You have all the powers that Shri Ganesha has.

28:53.438 --> 28:55.985
The greatest power that Shri Ganesha has,

28:56.186 --> 28:59.936
that you can come so close to Me.

29:00.801 --> 29:05.801
No other gods can come that close to Me as you can come.

29:08.916 --> 29:14.166
Kundalini cannot be risen by any gods, any incarnations

29:14.367 --> 29:17.421
but Shri Ganesha.

29:18.293 --> 29:24.152
He has to inform the kundalini, otherwise kundalini cannot rise.

29:24.498 --> 29:28.907
And it is you who have the power to raise the kundalini

29:29.108 --> 29:31.538
on your fingers. How many powers I have given you.

29:31.755 --> 29:34.959
you have no idea at all.

29:35.160 --> 29:41.199
I have made you in the pattern of Shri Ganesh.

29:42.051 --> 29:45.158
So you have to establish that innocence within you;

29:45.359 --> 29:47.811
that is being also established.

29:48.012 --> 29:50.502
You’ll get back your innocence.

29:50.703 --> 29:54.599
But the second thing which is so important about Shri Ganesh

29:54.800 --> 29:56.165
one has to learn, that

29:56.366 --> 30:00.649
He does not know any other god but His Mother.

30:00.850 --> 30:04.803
For Him nothing exists but His Mother.

30:05.512 --> 30:07.593
He’s so dedicated.

30:07.794 --> 30:12.159
There’s a story once when Parvati,

30:12.360 --> 30:16.039
His Mother gave –

30:17.609 --> 30:21.333
said that “I will give You a big present,

30:21.534 --> 30:24.380
that there should be competition between You two brothers.”

30:24.581 --> 30:28.545
Second was the Kartikeya, the one, another brother of His

30:28.746 --> 30:32.847
who came on this Earth just to destroy this Narakasura.

30:33.048 --> 30:35.947
Is the, all the destructive powers

30:36.148 --> 30:38.896
were combined to create Kartikeya.

30:39.097 --> 30:44.594
So She said, “Whosoever goes round this Earth,

30:44.795 --> 30:47.638
I’ll give You a prize.”

30:48.438 --> 30:53.752
So, the conveyance of

30:53.953 --> 30:57.360
Kartikeya is such a fast one, is a peacock.

30:57.561 --> 31:01.943
So He got onto His peacock, started flying out like an aeroplane.

31:02.237 --> 31:07.423
And Shri Ganesha’s conveyance is just a little mouse,

31:07.624 --> 31:10.842
so what should He do? He took to wisdom.

31:11.043 --> 31:14.988
He said, “Who can be greater than My Mother?

31:15.693 --> 31:17.977
She has created all the gods.

31:18.178 --> 31:21.270
She’s the Mahakali, She’s the Adi Shakti.

31:21.471 --> 31:24.123
She has created all the gods, She has created all the universes,

31:24.324 --> 31:27.307
She’s the one who has done everything, who can be greater than Her?

31:27.508 --> 31:31.665
She’s the greatest of all.” So she just, He just went round Her

31:31.866 --> 31:34.719
only thrice and He got the prize.

31:34.920 --> 31:39.177
And still He was flying in the air, Kartikeya.

31:39.474 --> 31:42.802
He fought even Shiva.

31:43.104 --> 31:45.947
He fought everyone.

31:46.184 --> 31:49.417
It’s a very interesting story how all that happened,

31:49.618 --> 31:53.407
that shows complete dedication.

31:53.608 --> 31:55.732
And for Sahaja yogis

31:55.933 --> 32:01.379
it is important to understand complete surrendering, dedication,

32:01.580 --> 32:07.853
and also a genuine feeling from the heart.

32:10.025 --> 32:13.731
I will ask Raul Bai sometimes to talk to you about the protocol,

32:13.932 --> 32:17.299
that’s important, though I am so close.

32:17.703 --> 32:23.220
Even Christ would not say anything;

32:23.421 --> 32:28.569
sometimes the way you people talk to Me, I am amazed.

32:29.105 --> 32:31.188
Certain things you say to Me, I’m amazed:

32:31.389 --> 32:36.064
how can you say these things to Me, knowingly what I am?

32:36.265 --> 32:39.304
But you forget.

32:39.547 --> 32:45.191
So it is important to understand that they were great

32:45.392 --> 32:50.289
because they knew the greatness of their Mother.

32:50.490 --> 32:53.850
In the same way, you all have to learn certain protocols

32:54.051 --> 32:56.488
which Raul Bai will teach you,

32:56.689 --> 33:00.501
so that you do not make any mistakes

33:00.702 --> 33:03.496
of saying things which are not proper.

33:03.697 --> 33:05.822
It comes from bad Vishuddhi, no doubt,

33:06.023 --> 33:08.963
but consciously if you work it out

33:09.164 --> 33:12.359
you will do good to yourself; because you know,

33:12.560 --> 33:15.373
anything against the Holy Spirit won’t be tolerated,

33:15.574 --> 33:19.472
anything, can you believe it?

33:19.969 --> 33:23.995
What strong words these are! Just think of it,

33:24.196 --> 33:28.188
anything against the Holy Spirit.

33:30.138 --> 33:32.559
So one has to understand the protocol, for Sahaja yogis,

33:32.760 --> 33:37.538
for Sahaja yogis, don’t talk against the Holy Spirit.

33:37.758 --> 33:40.996
But the protocol is there which one must understand,

33:41.197 --> 33:44.365
and how far to go, how far to understand

33:44.578 --> 33:50.292
is very, very, absolutely rudimentary for Sahaja Yoga.

33:50.780 --> 33:53.267
So today we have a great day

33:53.468 --> 34:01.038
of Shri Ganesha’s Mother being established, incarnated.

34:01.239 --> 34:05.264
Today is the day She had Her bath, we can say,

34:05.465 --> 34:08.734
and that’s why I said I’ll come and have a bath here.

34:08.935 --> 34:10.935
About the times and timings,

34:11.136 --> 34:13.971
one should know that Mother knows best,

34:14.172 --> 34:17.759
and everything works out with the timing properly.

34:17.960 --> 34:23.413
Because the, you know you are, you are ahead of India,

34:24.374 --> 34:28.286
and all the timings work out in that way.

34:28.487 --> 34:32.069
So everything has to work in the way,

34:32.270 --> 34:34.694
actually the timings are of the moon,

34:34.895 --> 34:37.470
so you don’t have to worry about what is the timing,

34:37.671 --> 34:39.552
what time this works out, this thing, that.

34:39.753 --> 34:42.162
The watches and all that, in Sahaja Yoga,

34:42.363 --> 34:46.809
work out according to My understanding.

34:47.010 --> 34:51.698
So one has to relax and just enjoy the puja.

34:51.899 --> 34:55.024
I think today you are going to receive lots of vibrations.

34:55.225 --> 34:57.393
Just enjoy them, just enjoy them.

34:57.594 --> 35:00.389
And if your ego is there or anything,

35:00.590 --> 35:04.152
just ask them to shut up, that’s all.

35:06.088 --> 35:07.496
All right?

35:07.697 --> 35:11.567
Now, so first we’ll have Ganesha Puja,

35:11.768 --> 35:13.436
as Modi will be doing,

35:13.637 --> 35:17.797
and he will be explaining what is to be done.

35:17.998 --> 35:22.013
How Ganesha is pleased with small, small things you will see now.

35:26.730 --> 35:29.714
[Hindi]

35:31.494 --> 35:34.968
Who will come for the – children should come for the puja?

35:35.169 --> 35:39.165
Let all the children come for the puja.
