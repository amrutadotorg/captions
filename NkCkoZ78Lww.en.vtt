00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:11.550
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:22.359
So much has been said and really my heart
is full of gratitude for all of you to come

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:33.420
here, all the way, and the way people have
described about Sahaja Yoga.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:41.290
To understand Sahaja Yoga, we should know
where are we today in this Kali Yuga.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.940
What are we facing today?

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:51.510
It should really make you feel quite disturbed
to see the way things are going on in every

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.030
country, everywhere.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.990
What's the problem?

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:08.050
What is the, such a need for people to become
so restless, full of tensions.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:15.680
Collectively, country-wise, anywhere you go
you find some sort of a confusion.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.250
Terrible.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:29.150
The whole society seems to be boiling with
a kind of a fear of destruction.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.340
What is the reason?

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.310
There are so many religions, so many organized,
disorganized, all kinds of things.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.180
There are so many sadhus and saints.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:46.250
There are so many books written about what
you should have.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:02:00.680
But the only one who is a seeker of truth
should see one point: Why, why there is so

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.990
much problem in this world and how can you
help them?

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.729
Where is the problem?

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.900
It is inside the human being.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.700
As described, you see, we have come out of
a animal stage to a human stage.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.340
We have a human awareness, no doubt.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:32.940
In that awareness, we start seeing all kinds
of things that are not good, which are destructive,

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.900
which are disturbing.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.480
If it doesn't disturb you, that means you
are not at all a sensitive person.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.840
But you are sensitive as a human being.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.830
So now what is the reason for this, is there.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:53.950
In every field of life, whether it is political,
economic or any field of life in which human

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:04.700
beings are living, there's a very subtle problem
which people don't understand.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:13.209
Now if I say that, "There is spirit within
us which shines in our heart," you need not

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.590
believe, need not believe.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.270
But our attention is not on the spirit.

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:29.020
They call it "atma vimukh" - our attention
is outside.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:38.010
At this stage at the human awareness, our
attention is outside, outside in various things.

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.950
Now where should our attention go?

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.410
To evolve, for what?

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.850
To achieve what?

00:03:46.850 --> 00:04:02.010
The firstly, our attention has now go towards
our spirit, towards spiritual understanding.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.940
This is one thing has to happen to human beings
to begin with.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.120
Otherwise our attention is outside.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.930
We are worried about money, worried about
power, worried about this, worried about that,

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.549
in competition and all kinds of things going
on.

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:29.060
But if your attention is turned somehow towards
your spirit then what happens to you is that

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:36.910
you become a power of the spirit.

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:44.250
And the power of the spirit is the highest
power that you could think of.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:51.470
First of all, spirit is the one that loves.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:05:00.410
Loves without asking for anything, without
expecting anything, just loves.

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:07.840
It's an unconditional type of a personality
which just emits love.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:14.310
Anybody in trouble, anybody having a problem,
just it flows.

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:22.280
This capacity to flow in the heart exists
but on top of that, is the closing point,

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.190
is that our attention is not on our spirit.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:34.449
Even in political endeavors or your economic
endeavors, any endeavor, what happens is that

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:37.530
attention is outside.

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:46.440
So you go into competition, you go into this
thing, you go on becoming very competent and

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.100
then suddenly you find another one coming
up.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:55.990
There are so many struggles when your attention
is outside.

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:01.110
Because in attention outside, there is no
purity.

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.990
There is no purity.

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:10.050
It's just attention to yourself and that too
is so limited.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:19.490
Very limited it is because if you pay attention
to yourself, there's no end to your troubles

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.110
and woes.

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:26.700
For a person, as they said, really is fact
that: I don't mind sleeping anywhere.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.710
I don't mind eating anything.

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.320
I am not bothered about all these things,
is a fact.

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:37.710
Because, you see, it's not very important
I think.

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.729
But without thinking, I am made like that.

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:41.550
I am like that, all right.

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:44.310
But Sahaja yogis have become like this.

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:52.680
This is the miracle that human beings have
turned their attention to their spirit.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:57.669
Then you are amazed how things work out.

00:06:57.669 --> 00:07:07.960
Without any competition, without any fights,
without any quarrels, how your attention becomes

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.910
fixed on your spirit.

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:15.410
First, the first thing that happens to you
is good health.

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:18.530
Your health improves.

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:24.639
Firstly, if your health is all right, I mean
so many problems are solved.

00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:29.650
This world, I think at least 30% people are
always sick.

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:35.449
Because of the tensions, maybe because of
bad food and this and that.

00:07:35.449 --> 00:07:40.160
This is first thing that happens to you is
your health improves.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:47.770
Today now in Sahaja Yoga, we have people who
have learned that by these modern ways of

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:52.770
economics and all that, has not given any
peace to anyone.

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:58.500
We think of America; I mean I've been to America,
I know Americans: How terribly disturbed they

00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:59.500
are.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:00.500
Their families are ruined.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:01.500
Their children are ruined.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:05.220
And all kinds of stupid things are happening.

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:09.270
Our Indian gurus are going and making a big
money there.

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:10.940
And they just want peace.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.210
They just want peace of the heart.

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:20.130
That's only possible when your attention goes
to your heart because in the heart resides

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:25.250
the spirit and the spirit is the source of
peace.

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:33.889
First is the love and second as I told you
just now is the peace.

00:08:33.889 --> 00:08:36.819
You become extremely peaceful.

00:08:36.819 --> 00:08:41.949
You become like a witness and you see the
whole drama like a joke.

00:08:41.949 --> 00:08:45.920
It's nothing so serious to be worried about.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.569
It all works out.

00:08:48.569 --> 00:08:56.280
And this is what one has to become is to become
the spirit which is your own, which is in

00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:04.950
your own heart and that is the source, as
I told you, of love and again I say of peace.

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:16.100
And the third thing that happens to you, that
the source of spirit being joy, that joy bubbles

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:18.019
in your life.

00:09:18.019 --> 00:09:19.290
It just bubbles in your life.

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:27.420
You don't know how to get out of that great
ocean of joy.

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:31.880
You start swimming in it, enjoying it, every
bit of it.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:38.249
You touch all the shores, going round the
whole world, their hearts and everything.

00:09:38.249 --> 00:09:40.850
It is in the heart that resides.

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:45.019
Again I say, it is not in the brain.

00:09:45.019 --> 00:09:49.720
No mental activity can take you to spirit.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:55.529
Spirit is only possible if your attention
could be somehow taken to the spirit.

00:09:55.529 --> 00:10:00.220
And that's possible only through Kundalini
awakening.

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:08.850
This change of attitude towards life, this
change of complete peace and joy has come

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:15.220
to you all because your attention is now on
your spirit.

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:19.239
Now you don't think of money, money walks
your way.

00:10:19.239 --> 00:10:22.600
You don't think of power, power walks your
way.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:33.529
And the power of the spirit is the highest,
the most powerful and the most righteous thing.

00:10:33.529 --> 00:10:42.110
It is not necessary that you should become
a sanyasi, sadhu baba, do all kinds of things.

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:44.730
No necessity of these rituals.

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:47.470
The spirit is residing within you.

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:49.410
Already all you have done in last lives.

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:55.220
Now this life only thing you have to do is
to put attention to your spirit.

00:10:55.220 --> 00:11:01.190
And that's only possible through the awakening
of this Kundalini - the Primordial Mother.

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:05.980
When She starts, I mean that's also your own.

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:15.610
When She starts rising, She passes through
the centers and enriches them, integrates

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:23.579
them, and pierces through the last fontanel
bone area and makes you connected to this

00:11:23.579 --> 00:11:27.259
all pervading power of divine love.

00:11:27.259 --> 00:11:34.610
But this power of divine love is not only
"the love," if you want to say, it is also

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:44.699
peace and joy and also it is the superior
wisdom.

00:11:44.699 --> 00:11:47.579
It is rather subtle for normal man to understand.

00:11:47.579 --> 00:11:48.579
I know that.

00:11:48.579 --> 00:11:49.970
I've gone through that.

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:57.799
For persons to understand that one can become
the spirit .. but this is in the evolutionary

00:11:57.799 --> 00:11:58.799
process.

00:11:58.799 --> 00:12:02.739
Today is the time for people to become the
spirit.

00:12:02.739 --> 00:12:09.589
This is the blessing of this blossom time
as I call it and people have to become the

00:12:09.589 --> 00:12:10.920
spirit.

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:16.670
Otherwise what is left of them is like all
other human beings who'll, I don't where they'll

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:17.839
end up.

00:12:17.839 --> 00:12:23.170
So this is an essential step today to become
the spirit.

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:29.049
All the saints, all the prophets, all the
religions have talked about it.

00:12:29.049 --> 00:12:30.230
Not that they have not.

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:32.139
Of course, we have twisted them.

00:12:32.139 --> 00:12:35.239
We have made separate, separate things.

00:12:35.239 --> 00:12:46.429
But it's only one simple thing is that you
are a spirit and that spirit, unless and until

00:12:46.429 --> 00:12:56.149
you become, you cannot achieve any peace,
any joy and no love.

00:12:56.149 --> 00:13:04.459
The Sahaja yogis here are sitting have achieved
it.

00:13:04.459 --> 00:13:11.240
They don't think they are from foreign countries
or from this country or that country.

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.240
They don't want.

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:18.410
Now here it is in this camp we don't have
very good arrangement for sleeping or eating

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:21.069
or anything, no good bathrooms, nothing.

00:13:21.069 --> 00:13:24.519
They are just enjoying themselves.

00:13:24.519 --> 00:13:25.519
Nobody minds it.

00:13:25.519 --> 00:13:29.699
Of course certain things of particular country
may linger on.

00:13:29.699 --> 00:13:33.589
But then it drops, it drops.

00:13:33.589 --> 00:13:37.480
Gradually it starts dropping out.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:40.440
Like a flower when it becomes the fruit.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:46.120
All its petals and everything drops out and
then it becomes the fruit.

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:54.449
So you have now become the fruit -fruit of
knowledge, fruit of wisdom and of love.

00:13:54.449 --> 00:13:58.459
For knowledge, you don't have to read books.

00:13:58.459 --> 00:13:59.649
There's no need to.

00:13:59.649 --> 00:14:03.540
People who have read too many are difficult
to get Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:11.279
But what you have to see yourself: What is
the reality?

00:14:11.279 --> 00:14:16.639
But that's only possible if you are a realized
soul.

00:14:16.639 --> 00:14:20.399
Otherwise you get lost in the illusions of
the world.

00:14:20.399 --> 00:14:24.919
You live with the illusions all your life,
struggling, fighting and I don't want to say

00:14:24.919 --> 00:14:27.149
what's the end is.

00:14:27.149 --> 00:14:33.449
So a simple thing that has happened with Sahaja
Yoga, in your evolutionary process your attention

00:14:33.449 --> 00:14:38.899
now has gone to spirit than to anything else.

00:14:38.899 --> 00:14:46.119
As soon as the power of the spirit comes,
you find yourself successful in everything.

00:14:46.119 --> 00:14:47.730
You don't want;.

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:53.799
You don't ask for it and if you are not, you
don't mind.

00:14:53.799 --> 00:14:56.179
You don't mind because you think they don't
understand.

00:14:56.179 --> 00:14:58.759
It's all right, forget it.

00:14:58.759 --> 00:15:02.630
So there's no use fighting for it, asking
for it.

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:11.609
For this, one thing is important, first and
foremost thing, you have to forgive everyone.

00:15:11.609 --> 00:15:16.480
Human beings, I don't know sometimes they're
illogical.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.880
Supposing somebody tries to harm you.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:21.149
All right, I forgive him.

00:15:21.149 --> 00:15:24.559
Forget it because I have no headache of that.

00:15:24.559 --> 00:15:28.689
What he is trying to do is to give me a headache
which I will not take.

00:15:28.689 --> 00:15:30.559
I just forgive.

00:15:30.559 --> 00:15:35.799
So that is a very important point, that Christ
has also said that, "You have to forgive."

00:15:35.799 --> 00:15:41.149
Mohammad Sahib has said so many things but
I don't know how people have twisted.

00:15:41.149 --> 00:15:45.519
Christ has said so many things, how I don't
know how they are being twisted.

00:15:45.519 --> 00:15:52.299
Every one of them has said one thing: that
you have to become the Spirit.

00:15:52.299 --> 00:15:58.720
And how people have twisted it and have formed
so many religions and in that religion why

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:00.049
should they quarrel?

00:16:00.049 --> 00:16:03.779
If there is one God there should be no quarrel.

00:16:03.779 --> 00:16:08.579
Now in Sahaja yoga, you find people have come
from different race, different countries,

00:16:08.579 --> 00:16:11.399
different ideologies, everything.

00:16:11.399 --> 00:16:14.540
One thing great about Sahaja yogis, they are
very pure people.

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:17.339
There's so much of purity in them.

00:16:17.339 --> 00:16:18.339
There's no problem.

00:16:18.339 --> 00:16:25.850
I do not have that problem of immorality in
Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:28.519
We don't find anybody being immoral.

00:16:28.519 --> 00:16:32.759
If somebody has been immoral, he just gets
corrected.

00:16:32.759 --> 00:16:37.189
If somebody has been cheating, he gets corrected.

00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:43.229
If somebody has been a corrupt person, he
gets corrected.

00:16:43.229 --> 00:16:50.809
Because spirit gives the light for you to
see for yourself what is good for you.

00:16:50.809 --> 00:16:54.600
Supposing you are going on a road and you
are blind.

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:57.149
You can walk into a ditch.

00:16:57.149 --> 00:17:00.749
But supposing you have the light and the eyes
open.

00:17:00.749 --> 00:17:02.489
You know how to go.

00:17:02.489 --> 00:17:08.750
And that's exactly what has happened in Sahaja
Yoga, that people have realized how to move,

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:15.270
how to go about, how to walk, and not to fall
in the ditch.

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:19.209
I have seen people who have fallen into ditch
also.

00:17:19.209 --> 00:17:21.500
But I have nothing but love for them.

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:26.770
Because they were blind, you see, for a blind
person you can just have love, isn't it?

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:33.700
And I found that once I forgive them completely
and I ask them, all right, even if they have

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:37.649
abused Me, said things against Me, it's all
right.

00:17:37.649 --> 00:17:39.639
Because they don't know what they are doing.

00:17:39.639 --> 00:17:41.799
They are blind people.

00:17:41.799 --> 00:17:48.039
So once you feel that way about others, that
doesn't matter.

00:17:48.039 --> 00:17:55.289
Whatever they have done, whatever they have
so far, so called harmed you also, is no harm

00:17:55.289 --> 00:18:01.539
to you because you are standing on a pedestal
of truth.

00:18:01.539 --> 00:18:08.809
So the second point is that the spirit is
the source of truth, not of untruth.

00:18:08.809 --> 00:18:12.809
For example, there is some false guru.

00:18:12.809 --> 00:18:14.950
Immediately you will know who is false.

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:15.950
How?

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:21.840
On your vibrations, on your fingertips you
know that this man is false.

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:27.970
Is all said by Mohammad Sahib that, "Your
hands will speak at the time of resurrection."

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:32.279
That exactly happens that you see: this is
the trouble.

00:18:32.279 --> 00:18:39.059
Now if you want you can avoid that person
or if you want you can bring him round and

00:18:39.059 --> 00:18:40.240
put him right.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:48.350
But we should not try on the complicated characters
very much in the beginning, I said, because

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:50.169
they will complicate you.

00:18:50.169 --> 00:18:57.039
Now those people who have matured in Sahaja
Yoga can easily manage that also.

00:18:57.039 --> 00:19:02.130
And also we must know that all the elements
are working for us.

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:09.549
All the events of the world are just to show
how wrong things are wrong and how right things

00:19:09.549 --> 00:19:10.740
should be done.

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:14.009
Say for example, when Hitler came.

00:19:14.009 --> 00:19:15.909
He started destroying people.

00:19:15.909 --> 00:19:18.870
And he took nine years to build himself up.

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:24.820
And he did all kinds of things which cannot
be forgiven by anyone.

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:31.419
But he died and suddenly you find in Germany,
people are so enlightened.

00:19:31.419 --> 00:19:39.990
Now you heard some people, I was amazed how
they are so enlightened about love and about

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:41.690
the divine.

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:48.160
All these countries, I've seen are doing so
well unexpectedly.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:54.169
Imagine in England, who came to India and
ruled us for three hundred years, there are

00:19:54.169 --> 00:19:56.270
so many Sahaja yogis.

00:19:56.270 --> 00:20:04.720
And also as you see today when I speak there,
we have the whole hall filled up with people,

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:05.720
in England.

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:14.580
I've seen also in the countries like Russia,
where these people were on the verge of collapsing

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:17.789
after they started on democracy.

00:20:17.789 --> 00:20:24.299
Whether it is democracy or communism or anything,
these are all isms.

00:20:24.299 --> 00:20:30.750
You have to come out of it and see for yourself
that so called democracy has become demon-ocracy.

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:35.029
So called communism has failed.

00:20:35.029 --> 00:20:36.029
Why?

00:20:36.029 --> 00:20:37.799
Basically what's wrong with them?

00:20:37.799 --> 00:20:42.669
It was all based not on the spiritual level.

00:20:42.669 --> 00:20:44.960
There was no spirit involved in it.

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:56.950
It was all based on, I should say, on the
endeavors which are outside, which were very

00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:58.110
limited.

00:20:58.110 --> 00:21:02.129
And those limits, once they break, you see
you have a problem.

00:21:02.129 --> 00:21:06.260
Now economics, the world economics if you
see is collapsing.

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:08.559
Everywhere there is recession.

00:21:08.559 --> 00:21:13.210
If they are such experts then why there is
recession?

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:14.870
Why there are problems?

00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:17.630
Now the people say we must remove the poverty.

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:27.370
I agree but not by giving some sort of a beggar's
gift but with self respect.

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:31.840
You can do it.

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:42.610
You can do it because if you can approach
people who need with Sahaja Yoga and enrich

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:48.789
them, you'll be amazed, they themselves will
do better and work it out.

00:21:48.789 --> 00:21:54.820
All kinds of things, you see, like in abroad
people used to say, "Mother, You talk of spiritual

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:57.220
life then why is it India is so poor?"

00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:01.330
I said, "They are not so poor in spirituality."

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:04.769
They may be poor in money.

00:22:04.769 --> 00:22:10.059
Those who have got lots of money, are they
also very good people?

00:22:10.059 --> 00:22:13.059
Are they also doing something very good?

00:22:13.059 --> 00:22:18.009
In the same way, those who are poor are not
doing something good that one should have

00:22:18.009 --> 00:22:19.130
compassion on them.

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:20.130
Agreed.

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:22.309
Now what to do?

00:22:22.309 --> 00:22:25.399
If both sides are so miserable, what should
we do?

00:22:25.399 --> 00:22:26.879
Is to change them.

00:22:26.879 --> 00:22:31.559
Change the whole attitude towards life.

00:22:31.559 --> 00:22:37.970
Immediately I've seen people who are supposed
to be rich start understanding poverty.

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:41.480
They start sharing.

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:44.930
They start working it out.

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:49.900
In Sahaja Yoga, you'll be amazed how people
help each other.

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:58.700
How they work out everybody's difficulties
and problems into something very beautiful.

00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:03.690
You see, it's the wisdom that you get from
this all pervading divine power.

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:07.320
This power has been described in every religion.

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:13.450
You call it nirakar, you call it ruuh, you
can call it paramchaitanya; you can call by

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:14.870
any name.

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:17.080
But name is not the point.

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:21.669
Whatever it is, once you are connected with
this power, you are blessed.

00:23:21.669 --> 00:23:26.460
Thousand times you are blessed than you are
as a normal human being.

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:30.680
As a normal being, no blessings it has.

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:36.049
It has nothing but your own endeavors that
the amount you push in, that's what you get.

00:23:36.049 --> 00:23:41.200
Here nobody pushes oneself.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.990
Automatically you are pushed into that.

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:47.580
This force, divine force brings you to that.

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:52.460
And you have seen that in your own lives how
you came to Me, how you came to Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:59.909
It was some sort of a divine force which worked
it out, which is Sahaja, which you may not

00:23:59.909 --> 00:24:05.123
realize but when you get your realization,
you just think about your own life: "How I

00:24:05.123 --> 00:24:08.809
came to Sahaja Yoga?

00:24:08.809 --> 00:24:10.720
How I got this?"

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:15.070
And then you see this peace, reigning over
your hearts.

00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:18.570
The love, affection, everything.

00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:25.700
What is, as you said, I have many powers,
maybe I don't know, but one thing for definite,

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:36.720
one thing that Sahaja yogis can get all My
powers.

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:47.130
As a Mother, Mother wants to give everything
to Sahaja yogis.

00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:58.510
This greatest joy for a Mother is to see Her
son or daughter grow up like Her.

00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:04.659
I, I have a great vision of life.

00:25:04.659 --> 00:25:10.059
And I see the picture of that here today.

00:25:10.059 --> 00:25:14.940
I was a ordinary housewife without much money.

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:16.820
You know My interest in money is zero.

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:22.299
I don't understand even the bank and the somebody
has to sign a cheque for Me.

00:25:22.299 --> 00:25:25.860
My husband has to count My money, I am so
bad.

00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:28.480
But still I've never had problem.

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:38.419
Never had problem because it is the greed
in man, terrible greed in man that creates

00:25:38.419 --> 00:25:39.529
problems.

00:25:39.529 --> 00:25:47.570
But if he learns how to be satisfied, automatically
the greed drops out and you feel absolutely

00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:48.570
comfortable.

00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:53.970
But that doesn't mean that you become a sadhu
baba or you become a sanyasi or a something

00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:55.320
you give up.

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:57.070
Those days are gone.

00:25:57.070 --> 00:25:59.641
Those ordeals you have passed through.

00:25:59.641 --> 00:26:00.641
You've been to the Himalayas.

00:26:00.641 --> 00:26:03.419
You've stood on your heads and did all kinds
of things.

00:26:03.419 --> 00:26:05.470
Now no more is needed.

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:12.090
What is needed is that: you have to put your
attention to your spirit, the more you do

00:26:12.090 --> 00:26:21.759
it, the more you absorb all other attentions
and put it to your spirit, which is there

00:26:21.759 --> 00:26:23.450
already existing.

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:28.480
There is nothing to be brought from outside
or nothing to be learnt.

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:32.850
It is inside every one of you, is in the heart.

00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:37.700
Only thing you have to, you have to just feel
it.

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:44.519
Now that feeling can only come if you are
awakened in the Kundalini.

00:26:44.519 --> 00:26:58.299
I know that no one like Mohammad Sahib or
Christ or Abraham or Moses, who have created

00:26:58.299 --> 00:27:06.139
books or whatever history they have created,
no where They would have ever thought that

00:27:06.139 --> 00:27:14.960
people will form an organized religion and
start in a way as if they are against each

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:15.960
other.

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:18.350
But it has happened.

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:20.399
It has happened.

00:27:20.399 --> 00:27:27.139
To remove that, you have to give them the
knowledge, the pure knowledge.

00:27:27.139 --> 00:27:30.240
Not the knowledge of the book but the pure
knowledge.

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:34.240
And the knowledge that is pure is wisdom.

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:38.499
Through this wisdom only I've worked.

00:27:38.499 --> 00:27:41.190
This wisdom I had from My childhood.

00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:42.279
Nobody has given Me.

00:27:42.279 --> 00:27:43.279
It's there.

00:27:43.279 --> 00:27:50.159
But this wisdom has taught Me one thing: that
whatsoever maybe the condition of a human

00:27:50.159 --> 00:27:59.250
being, whatsoever maybe his style, whatsoever
may be his ego or his conditioning if he can

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:05.929
feel the love then his spirit gets [transformed?].

00:28:05.929 --> 00:28:08.960
This transformation has taken place.

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:15.330
Here we have only one percent of the people
who have got realization all over the world.

00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:23.960
But I know, I remember them all today who
are not here, that they have been seekers,

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:28.769
madly seeking, seeking the truth.

00:28:28.769 --> 00:28:32.379
They went through horrible time seeking.

00:28:32.379 --> 00:28:33.679
They had very bad gurus.

00:28:33.679 --> 00:28:37.460
They had all kinds of expenses, everything
they did.

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:42.759
But once they came to Sahaja Yoga, they have
found what was the truth is.

00:28:42.759 --> 00:28:47.559
And the truth is very simple: that you are
the spirit.

00:28:47.559 --> 00:28:54.049
You are not this body, this mind, but you
are the spirit.

00:28:54.049 --> 00:28:57.940
This is the truth and they have found the
spirit.

00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:01.590
That's what is the truth that they have found.

00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:09.629
Once this truth is established within you,
that you are the spirit, nothing can destroy

00:29:09.629 --> 00:29:13.450
you, nothing can harm you.

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:16.220
It cannot have any wants.

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:17.220
It doesn't have.

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:22.179
What wants can you have when you have the
spirit because such a satisfying thing?

00:29:22.179 --> 00:29:26.029
It doesn't condemn anyone.

00:29:26.029 --> 00:29:29.499
It doesn't runs after anyone.

00:29:29.499 --> 00:29:34.139
Is satisfied with itself, absolutely satisfied.

00:29:34.139 --> 00:29:39.799
You see, I was very anxious that I should
lead a very normal life.

00:29:39.799 --> 00:29:45.889
I should not be like some Himalaya fellow
or something like that.

00:29:45.889 --> 00:29:50.149
Because this is needed for a common people.

00:29:50.149 --> 00:29:56.700
Today it's a aim en mass, en mass awakening.

00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:58.759
It is not for one person.

00:29:58.759 --> 00:30:05.679
This was the thing because once any discovery
is made, supposing, and that discovery only

00:30:05.679 --> 00:30:08.399
is for one individual, it has no meaning.

00:30:08.399 --> 00:30:10.330
It has to go to masses.

00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:14.710
And this is what I knew: I have to do it.

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:19.919
And I had to work - they say so but I don't
think I ever worked.

00:30:19.919 --> 00:30:22.249
I was just witness to whole thing.

00:30:22.249 --> 00:30:29.720
I saw it just like a witness enjoying all
kinds of things as you sit on the shore of

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:30.720
a ocean.

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:34.090
You see waves coming, going like that.

00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:45.150
But inside, inside that is a human being who
wants to evolve, who wants to become the spirit.

00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:48.950
Then he starts thinking what good he can do
to others.

00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:55.340
So far I've been very anxious that people
should become Sahaja yogis.

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:59.659
I didn't take to any missionary work or any
social work.

00:30:59.659 --> 00:31:04.580
I used to do when I was not in Sahaja Yoga,
I should say, when I didn't start the Sahaja

00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:05.580
Yoga.

00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:14.639
But later on, I discovered that unless and
until you transform people, unless and until

00:31:14.639 --> 00:31:19.700
you become the spirit, you'll become like
any other social worker.

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:22.399
I was working in a, say, blind school.

00:31:22.399 --> 00:31:27.440
I was the chairman of the blind school, blind
people.

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:33.970
And I was surprised, the people who were with
Me were very funny type you know?

00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:39.070
The governor was to come and they said, "Who
will sit next to governor?"

00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:41.159
I said, "What is this?"

00:31:41.159 --> 00:31:45.249
So they said also, "I being the president,
I have to sit."

00:31:45.249 --> 00:31:46.639
I said, "Not necessary.

00:31:46.639 --> 00:31:48.220
I can sit anywhere."

00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:51.159
But they all started quarreling on this point.

00:31:51.159 --> 00:31:59.100
So I said, "All right, we'll take a plank
and put it on head of the - of the governor

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:02.909
and you all sit on that like sparrows."

00:32:02.909 --> 00:32:05.999
That humor helped a lot and they settled down.

00:32:05.999 --> 00:32:12.200
So this is the stupid thing where you see
it, what is your position, what do you get?

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:19.509
I mean it's so stupid that even the ant knows
how to work out the collectivity.

00:32:19.509 --> 00:32:26.259
I don't know how human beings are dying after
useless nonsensical things.

00:32:26.259 --> 00:32:30.869
But the only thing is, he has not yet become
the spirit.

00:32:30.869 --> 00:32:34.929
So he doesn't respect himself, no respect.

00:32:34.929 --> 00:32:40.840
So he does all these things which are not
very respectable I think.

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:47.600
Then I thought that this kind of work people
are doing, they think no end of themselves.

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:54.480
Once you start doing something good, why should
you think you are very great?

00:32:54.480 --> 00:33:00.129
I, I can't understand, you see, My brain is
that way useless.

00:33:00.129 --> 00:33:05.380
Because what I found with these people who
were working with Me, very anxious to take

00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:07.350
the credit for this.

00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:09.960
Somebody wanted to become the chairman, vice-chairman.

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:12.489
I said, "You become everything."

00:33:12.489 --> 00:33:19.940
So the attention being on your promotion,
it's not a real promotion, no promotion.

00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:25.739
Everybody used to laugh at them, it's a degradation.

00:33:25.739 --> 00:33:35.330
Your promotion is not through your own being
but through your own spirit.

00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:42.380
Being means a very big thing, I think, but
spirit is very subtle, very beautiful which

00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:44.690
is residing in all of you like a light.

00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:47.720
It's a light in you.

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:52.220
Now there are Sahaja, so many Sahaja yogis
who are giving enlightenment to others.

00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:55.020
There are people who are going all over the
world.

00:33:55.020 --> 00:34:05.080
I was surprised that people from Germany and
Austria came to help Me when I first went

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:06.080
to Russia.

00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:08.770
I said, "What are you doing here?"

00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:15.470
Said, "Mother we have to do something because
so many people were killed by our forefathers."

00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:20.500
Then My heart started really thanking them.

00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:23.869
Look at this, what has come into them?

00:34:23.869 --> 00:34:30.490
Then they went, you'll be amazed, to Israel
and from Israel they brought lots of Sahaja

00:34:30.490 --> 00:34:31.810
yogis to Egypt.

00:34:31.810 --> 00:34:35.859
So I asked the Israelis, Sahaja yogis, "Why
are you here?"

00:34:35.859 --> 00:34:44.379
They said, "Mother it's our job now to make
friends with these Sahaja yogis from Egypt."

00:34:44.379 --> 00:34:53.190
Just see how love engulfs all these angularities,
all these thorns of life and dissolves it

00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:55.319
completely.

00:34:55.319 --> 00:35:02.400
It's so joy giving to see your love acting
on others.

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:08.480
Small, small things and very big things, all
that works out with love.

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:18.270
For example, in an industry now people have
problems of strikes.

00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:29.520
Very common struggle, haves and have not and
this going on.

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:36.299
But if you can raise the people to the spiritual
height, to their spiritual need which is the

00:35:36.299 --> 00:35:45.230
most important need today, you'll be amazed
there will be no problem of any kind.

00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:49.329
You see, it is a kind of a communism.

00:35:49.329 --> 00:35:51.559
It's a kind of a socialism.

00:35:51.559 --> 00:35:53.810
It's a kind of a democracy.

00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:58.690
It's all things put together which works.

00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:06.369
Democracy means we have Sahaja yogis who wanted
to organize this.

00:36:06.369 --> 00:36:09.080
They said, "Mother what should we do?"

00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:10.680
I said, "I am not going to say anything.

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:12.579
You do what you like.

00:36:12.579 --> 00:36:17.150
You choose whatever you like, whatever you
want to do."

00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:21.809
And I was just busy arranging the flowers
in the house because so many flowers came

00:36:21.809 --> 00:36:23.109
and I am worried about the flowers.

00:36:23.109 --> 00:36:26.069
I was just arranging the flowers in the house.

00:36:26.069 --> 00:36:34.980
And what I find, now see how they've done:
no quarrel, no fight, no discussion, nothing.

00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:37.960
How have they done?

00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:41.820
Otherwise you cannot make ten people sit together
and talk the same way.

00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:45.869
One will talk, another will talk, another
will talk, will go on discussing, discussing

00:36:45.869 --> 00:36:49.349
this, reaching nowhere.

00:36:49.349 --> 00:36:53.250
Otherwise only one man has to work it out,
otherwise nothing can work.

00:36:53.250 --> 00:37:02.280
So you see, it changes the whole atmosphere
of every human being.

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:09.820
Changes his attitude, changes his endeavors
and everything becomes so beautiful and joy

00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:14.490
giving.

00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:21.190
You are a socialist also because you start
thinking about the people who are down trodden,

00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:30.099
people who have no money who are poor, and
you try to work out something by which they

00:37:30.099 --> 00:37:31.809
get some money.

00:37:31.809 --> 00:37:38.550
I used to go with My father for a case in
a district called Chanda.

00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:43.130
And there I saw people just with one cloth
around them.

00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:50.220
What was shocking to Me: just one cloth, whether
it is winter or summer.

00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:56.200
I used to weep so My father would say, "Why
to weep before them?"

00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:57.780
I said, "What can I do?

00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:00.560
I must try to do something for them."

00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:09.410
Now when I got so many Sahaja yogis, I told
them, "I want to help these people somehow.

00:38:09.410 --> 00:38:13.650
And what they make is pottery."

00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:15.270
So they said, "Mother, all right.

00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:16.630
You can get the pottery.

00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:20.210
We'll import here and we'll sell them."

00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:26.520
You'll be amazed now, these people have got
houses, they have got a good life to live

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:28.250
and they are living very well.

00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:32.730
So in a way, it is a kind of a socialism.

00:38:32.730 --> 00:38:40.770
That you see problems and you know collectively
to solve it, collectively, not singularly

00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:41.770
but collectively.

00:38:41.770 --> 00:38:46.470
The all of the Sahaja yogis suggest, "Mother,
this can be solved."

00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:54.100
So far I have not done anything directly,
I must say, like starting a organization of

00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:55.230
that kind.

00:38:55.230 --> 00:39:01.170
But now when there are so many Sahaja yogis
with their attention on their heart, now My

00:39:01.170 --> 00:39:06.200
attention is going to the people who need
our help.

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:13.530
So first time, I have asked them to make an
NGO for destitute women and for children who

00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:16.850
are being deserted by their parents.

00:39:16.850 --> 00:39:20.349
And immediately, you'll be amazed, it all
did.

00:39:20.349 --> 00:39:21.349
We got the land.

00:39:21.349 --> 00:39:22.349
We got the people.

00:39:22.349 --> 00:39:26.280
I mean, I'm not doing anything and it's all
done.

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:31.020
Moreover, so many people have written, "Mother
if You want land, we can give You.

00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:33.490
You come here, do this, do that."

00:39:33.490 --> 00:39:35.060
Can you imagine?

00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:40.040
Once I just thought of it: that we have to
do something for the poor people.

00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:48.150
Also other so many things can be done with
your attention which is pure, full of love

00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:55.500
because the love, you see, is something that
gives you the wisdom how to do it.

00:39:55.500 --> 00:40:03.720
If you have love, it gives you the complete
insight into the problems and how it works.

00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:14.180
See it's surprising for Me, I mean, I used
to do that always but even after Sahaja Yoga

00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:18.280
I found that is the love is the solution.

00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:24.549
Is this only way we can enter into the hearts
of people.

00:40:24.549 --> 00:40:30.859
But for that love, we should not try to do
it for some money or for some achievements

00:40:30.859 --> 00:40:40.430
or for some sort of a reward, but just the
whim of the love and that is what is today

00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:45.660
paying all of you: The way you love all the
people.

00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:47.121
The way you have done so much work.

00:40:47.121 --> 00:40:51.780
You don't know what gratitude I have for you.

00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:53.940
Single-handed I could not have done it.

00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:56.470
I could not have gone to so many countries.

00:40:56.470 --> 00:41:02.040
It's a like a place like Benin, where there
are only Muslims are there, I would never

00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:07.700
- I could never have thought of going to that
far fetched place where these people are there

00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:12.800
and imagine these people are Muslims and they
have all taken to Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:17.890
And in that they are understanding the beauty
of love.

00:41:17.890 --> 00:41:20.349
You, this is done by French.

00:41:20.349 --> 00:41:23.890
Can you believe these French?

00:41:23.890 --> 00:41:29.040
Going down all the way to Benin and getting
it done.

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:40.490
Even English have gone all the way to different
countries; even the Austrians and also Germans

00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:46.780
and Italians are another quality of people
who have a very rich heart, I must say.

00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:52.910
They have a very rich heart and the way they
are spreading Sahaja Yoga throughout Italy

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:54.210
is really remarkable.

00:41:54.210 --> 00:42:03.250
I am amazed how these people are approaching
all these people who have never known what

00:42:03.250 --> 00:42:08.359
is spirit is and how they are getting them
to Mother.

00:42:08.359 --> 00:42:12.730
Now with that, you see, we don't have to say
"prohibition."

00:42:12.730 --> 00:42:16.160
We don't have to say "don't take drugs," nothing.

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:18.950
No don'ts in Sahaja Yoga.

00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:19.980
Automatically they drop.

00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:22.770
I don't have to say, "Don't do it."

00:42:22.770 --> 00:42:25.220
Just automatically they drop.

00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:33.980
I mean you'll be amazed, once we had a program
and there was a light to be put in a one of

00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:38.680
the deepas and nobody had a matchbox.

00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:39.680
Can you imagine?

00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:40.680
Nobody has a matchbox.

00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:44.480
Is such a problem with thousands of people
there, nobody has matchbox.

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:48.270
So we had to send somebody to get the matchbox.

00:42:48.270 --> 00:42:49.829
There's no need.

00:42:49.829 --> 00:42:52.789
So I never say, "Don't do this," never.

00:42:52.789 --> 00:42:58.069
I've never said it but it has worked like
that, it has worked.

00:42:58.069 --> 00:43:03.700
I don't know how, how you have dropped it
but it's very simple when the light of the

00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:05.349
spirit is there.

00:43:05.349 --> 00:43:09.630
In that light, you just don't.

00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:14.020
Now all the people have said, "Don't drink."

00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:21.319
Say for example: Sikhs, Muslims but you see
they all drink because they are not really

00:43:21.319 --> 00:43:23.970
Muslims, they are not really Sikhs.

00:43:23.970 --> 00:43:26.520
If they were really that, they would not have
drunk.

00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:30.559
How is it possible then?

00:43:30.559 --> 00:43:32.390
They have to be the spirit.

00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:37.910
In the light of the spirit, we just don't
do anything that is destructive, just don't

00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:38.910
do it.

00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:40.200
You don't have to tell anybody.

00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:45.360
Now you are all sitting here, you know that
I've never told you anyone, "Don't do this."

00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:51.220
But I was amazed in London that people overnight
gave up drugs, overnight.

00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:56.299
People employ military, this, that drugs is
[INAUDIBLE].

00:43:56.299 --> 00:43:57.849
They gave up prostitution.

00:43:57.849 --> 00:44:04.160
They gave (up) drugs, all kinds of destructive
things to which human being take sometimes

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:10.290
out of frustration and sometimes because they
feel very lonely.

00:44:10.290 --> 00:44:14.440
But now in Sahaja Yoga, you can never be lonely.

00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:18.280
All over the world, you have brothers and
sisters.

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:24.160
If they come to know somebody is there somebody
is coming, they'll all go to the airport to

00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:25.160
receive.

00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:30.840
It's not a brotherhood of a ordinary life.

00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:32.859
It's a very deep type of a brotherhood.

00:44:32.859 --> 00:44:35.510
It's a very deep understanding.

00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:40.039
But they are very deep people, I must say,
because they have been seekers and in that

00:44:40.039 --> 00:44:49.589
seeking they have really got completely into
a turmoil and that has made them very deep

00:44:49.589 --> 00:44:50.589
people.

00:44:50.589 --> 00:44:55.530
This book is "Light of Quran" is written by
a lady Gilmet.

00:44:55.530 --> 00:44:56.530
You read it.

00:44:56.530 --> 00:44:59.600
I would request you to read it because she
is so deep.

00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:06.799
I knew she was very deep but the way she has
expressed is so beautiful, so joy giving that

00:45:06.799 --> 00:45:12.670
she's not a Muslim, she married a Muslim,
so called, because they were all Sahaja yogis

00:45:12.670 --> 00:45:18.140
and the way she has narrated her seeking is
so beautiful.

00:45:18.140 --> 00:45:24.059
We have so many big writers in Sahaja Yoga
who have given very, very nice books and things.

00:45:24.059 --> 00:45:26.210
But this Gilmet is very shy.

00:45:26.210 --> 00:45:27.210
She doesn't talk.

00:45:27.210 --> 00:45:28.650
She keeps quiet.

00:45:28.650 --> 00:45:32.670
But inside, she's so deep because of her seeking.

00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:40.130
So there are many people in this world who
are seeking the truth because they cannot

00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:47.789
bear the nonsense of modern world and they
are very sensitive.

00:45:47.789 --> 00:45:50.109
They are not insensitive, very sensitive people.

00:45:50.109 --> 00:45:54.030
That's how you all got your realization.

00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:55.869
It's nothing of Mine.

00:45:55.869 --> 00:45:58.520
To say that "I did it," is not proper.

00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:04.140
If you were not like a candle, I could not
have enlightened you.

00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:06.099
So I am very thankful to you.

00:46:06.099 --> 00:46:13.299
And I am so much enamored by the way you people
are feeling about Sahaja Yoga: that collectively

00:46:13.299 --> 00:46:17.690
you have to work it out, globally you have
to work it out.

00:46:17.690 --> 00:46:21.290
You have to help each other and bring up the
people.

00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:29.410
Most important thing is to create a mind universally
which is towards the spirit.

00:46:29.410 --> 00:46:32.030
Then we'll solve all the problems, no problem.

00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:38.230
Now if I say I am starting some sort of a
project here for the poor.

00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:42.090
Immediately all of them will send Me money.

00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:43.090
Immediately they'll all work.

00:46:43.090 --> 00:46:47.170
They'll find out who can work it out, who
can come and help Mother.

00:46:47.170 --> 00:46:48.960
What work can we give them?

00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:52.240
How to work it out, all over the world.

00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:54.850
I mean, it spreads so fast.

00:46:54.850 --> 00:46:57.000
I have to just say that.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.630
I never asked for money.

00:46:58.630 --> 00:47:04.290
I never said, "I need money," but immediately
they will plan out the whole thing, bring

00:47:04.290 --> 00:47:06.770
the whole thing here and work it out.

00:47:06.770 --> 00:47:09.869
It can work in India, it can work anywhere.

00:47:09.869 --> 00:47:13.130
It's not just they are interested in India.

00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:16.480
But globally they are interested in the problems.

00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:24.029
It is not for making some sort of a show or
some sort of a, we can say, a cult.

00:47:24.029 --> 00:47:31.890
It is something which is very innate, which
is very subtle and that works, that gives

00:47:31.890 --> 00:47:33.020
them joy.

00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:36.520
That gives them joy to do something for Sahaja
Yoga.

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:47.599
I am sometimes amazed how they feel for the
whole world, how they care for the whole world,

00:47:47.599 --> 00:47:49.170
how they are willing to do for [?].

00:47:49.170 --> 00:47:52.940
Of course as I said, every country has some
problems.

00:47:52.940 --> 00:48:01.440
Like, we can say that north Indians are interested
always in politics because Delhi is here.

00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:03.380
But is reduced now, very much reduced now.

00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:06.230
There's not much going on.

00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:09.190
And they don't like to hear anything against
anyone.

00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:10.910
That's a good thing.

00:48:10.910 --> 00:48:18.280
And in the south, we can say in the beyond
Narmada river, whatever we have, Maharashtra

00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:22.720
and all that, they are very ritualistic, very
ritualistic people.

00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:27.160
Even if they put the thali [thali MEANS PLATE
FOR DINING], you must put salt here, you must

00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:33.220
put vegetable here, you .. so that a blind
man can also eat food properly.

00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:35.160
You must use only one hand.

00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:36.839
You must keep another hand tied up.

00:48:36.839 --> 00:48:42.310
They're very, very ritualistic because of
these two things, you see, in Sahaja Yoga

00:48:42.310 --> 00:48:44.380
they do not grow.

00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:51.349
Whatever it is, we have to understand that
these are [lingering PROBABLY ?] still are

00:48:51.349 --> 00:48:52.349
behind us.

00:48:52.349 --> 00:48:57.870
For example in north India, I would say if
anybody speaks anything ill about anybody,

00:48:57.870 --> 00:48:59.050
just put your.

00:48:59.050 --> 00:49:02.000
This principle of Gandhiji was correct.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:05.420
Never listen to any nonsensical gossip.

00:49:05.420 --> 00:49:07.319
Gossip is going on.

00:49:07.319 --> 00:49:11.230
People like to listen to gossip because of
this media also.

00:49:11.230 --> 00:49:14.380
They were showing nothing but gossip before
election.

00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:18.799
And the whole gossip goes into our mind and
that's how we work out.

00:49:18.799 --> 00:49:25.029
So for this part, I would request all the
people from the north India to never to listen

00:49:25.029 --> 00:49:29.300
any criticism, never to criticize anyone.

00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:31.319
What is the use?

00:49:31.319 --> 00:49:37.210
Just see logically: if you listen to somebody's
criticism, what is the use?

00:49:37.210 --> 00:49:39.890
What do you gain out of it?

00:49:39.890 --> 00:49:45.510
Now by repeating it to somebody else, what
do you gain?

00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:46.510
What is the gain?

00:49:46.510 --> 00:49:52.190
Simple thing, always ask the question: What
is the gain?

00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:55.880
And why to see something wrong with others?

00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:58.880
I know by that you can be cheated.

00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:02.339
Somebody can deceive you, is true.

00:50:02.339 --> 00:50:04.480
But doesn't matter.

00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:06.880
You don't get anything into your head.

00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:11.039
You don't get any filth and any poison in
your head.

00:50:11.039 --> 00:50:17.089
I know there are people who create problem,
talk from one to another, do this, do that.

00:50:17.089 --> 00:50:23.369
But that should not harm you in anyway because
you have the spirit and the spirit cannot

00:50:23.369 --> 00:50:24.369
be harmed.

00:50:24.369 --> 00:50:25.380
It cannot be destroyed.

00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:29.650
It is said that, "It cannot be destroyed by
any weapon.

00:50:29.650 --> 00:50:32.319
It lives and lives forever."

00:50:32.319 --> 00:50:40.380
So the attention towards the atma is lacking,
atma vimukta.

00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:50.289
We, our eyes have gone, our attention is gone
to something away from the spirit and that's

00:50:50.289 --> 00:50:52.760
why all the problems are there.

00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:59.960
Once you are one with your spirit, it works.

00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:06.170
It works for you because it is in connection
with the God almighty.

00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:13.990
It is in connection with the all pervading
power, which works out everything.

00:51:13.990 --> 00:51:16.079
I know this all pervading power.

00:51:16.079 --> 00:51:21.180
It has showing so many miraculous photographs
about Me.

00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:25.260
And actually I, I didn't ask It but It is
doing.

00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:27.390
Because very active, It is very active.

00:51:27.390 --> 00:51:32.829
And if It sees anybody who is subtle and who
is deep, It acts.

00:51:32.829 --> 00:51:39.700
In your business, in your politics, in your
family in everywhere you'll find this light

00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:49.790
will shine and you'll respect, respect the
hearts of a person.

00:51:49.790 --> 00:51:52.470
You'll respect the love of others.

00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:57.680
You will respect the spirit that is shining
in others.

00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:04.910
This is the reason why you have learned to
respect each other, because your spirit is

00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:05.910
enlightened.

00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:06.910
I can see it so clearly.

00:52:06.910 --> 00:52:13.200
I am so very happy to see so many of you here
for My birthday.

00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:19.740
I don't know what is the significance of a
birthday is but whatever it is, it is one

00:52:19.740 --> 00:52:26.170
of the things that I can meet you, all of
you here, so very happy.

00:52:26.170 --> 00:52:31.589
I am thankful to these people who are elites
of our society.

00:52:31.589 --> 00:52:39.500
They are very great people elected and sometimes
given very high positions and also there are

00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:41.329
some very well known industrialists.

00:52:41.329 --> 00:52:49.180
All of them have to understand the value of
sprititual life.

00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:52.030
It's very important for them.

00:52:52.030 --> 00:53:01.619
Not to avoid this point but to be one with
your spirit is your own property, is in your

00:53:01.619 --> 00:53:10.190
own, I should say, the complete glory that
you have is to be the spirit.

00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:16.799
With all this, I don't know how to thank you
all and how to thank all these people who

00:53:16.799 --> 00:53:19.450
spoke so nicely.

00:53:19.450 --> 00:53:26.910
Only thing, I wish you all a great growth
in your spiritual life atmonnati, into your

00:53:26.910 --> 00:53:35.660
spirituality so that it covers all the corners
of the world and create a beautiful world

00:53:35.660 --> 00:53:36.660
of tomorrow.

00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:37.480
May God bless you!
