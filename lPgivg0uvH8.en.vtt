00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.040
Happy New Year to you all!

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:23.640
May God bless you this year with all His divine powers.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:32.000
May all the choicest flowers of joy

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.960
and happiness be showered upon you.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:48.280
May God give you wisdom to become great Sahaja Yogis,

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:57.480
so that a new world can be created beautifully out of you.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.320
We have to give up our old conditionings,

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.640
I mean, we have to start a new life of understanding and wisdom.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.560
Today is a day when we should decide,

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:18.360
take some vows in our hearts, what we want to do for our future,

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.080
for Sahaja Yoga, for building of our lives.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.120
They say whatever you do on the first,

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.880
it happens to you all the year round,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.240
and I don’t want to speak like this all the time.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.440
Because I’ve been speaking too much.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.080
So best way to enjoy New Year is to decide

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.480
as to what we are going to do now, further.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.520
What are we going to achieve next year

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.920
so that we can look back and say that in one year we have done this job.
