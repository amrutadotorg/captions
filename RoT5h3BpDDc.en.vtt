00:00.992 --> 00:03.728
It is not difficult to find out

00:04.341 --> 00:09.763
how this universe is organized.

00:12.577 --> 00:19.680
Every scientist who is open minded can see for himself

00:21.514 --> 00:29.387
that this universe is a beautiful cosmos, is very well organized

00:29.705 --> 00:32.264
and has run very smoothly

00:32.542 --> 00:37.780
and can also deduce that the creation of this universe,

00:38.038 --> 00:39.617
this particular universe

00:39.836 --> 00:43.565
has led to the creation of this Mother Earth.

00:48.943 --> 00:54.894
Five million years back, about, this Mother Earth

00:55.986 --> 01:03.783
in gaseous form seceded and was cooled down.

01:03.808 --> 01:10.303
How was it cooled down, no-one knows.

01:10.541 --> 01:18.001
But if it was cooled down, why is it not that cool as the Sun is?

01:18.239 --> 01:21.892
Because in the science, nobody thinks as to ‘How?’

01:22.445 --> 01:26.993
They just accept as it is.  They are not supposed to know,

01:27.212 --> 01:30.879
or they cannot find out because they have limitations.

01:31.057 --> 01:35.362
Why this thing happened? How it was done?

01:36.905 --> 01:39.999
It is easy to say there is no God

01:40.219 --> 01:45.595
but very difficult to explain many things
without saying that there is God,

01:45.814 --> 01:49.980
For example, the time that was taken

01:52.382 --> 01:57.515
for this universe to create a human being is so very short,

01:57.793 --> 02:01.324
is so very short that nothing can explain it.

02:03.130 --> 02:07.827
If you use the law of chance

02:09.403 --> 02:13.958
– perhaps some of the mathematicians,
if they are here, they may know

02:15.962 --> 02:21.862
– by which we can find out how many times

02:22.912 --> 02:26.713
the permutations and combinations have to work

02:27.567 --> 02:30.681
to create even a living cell.

02:32.051 --> 02:41.504
For example, in a test tube if you have 50 red pills

02:42.000 --> 02:44.896
and 50 white pills,

02:46.112 --> 02:50.912
all arranged in such a manner
that all the red ones are at the bottom

02:51.846 --> 02:59.127
and the white ones are on the top, you have to go on shaking them,

03:00.279 --> 03:05.372
and when you go on shaking them, they are all disorganized.

03:06.345 --> 03:13.993
Then to organize it fully how many times one has to shake?

03:15.085 --> 03:21.394
They have discovered a formula,
that is N raised to power something, something.

03:23.181 --> 03:33.737
According to this formula, if human beings are created by chance,

03:34.948 --> 03:42.289
it seems an impossibility; because the time
that is taken so far is so short

03:42.468 --> 03:48.193
that only, at the most, may be,
some living cell could have been created.

03:48.590 --> 03:53.660
Why a complicated human being has been created

03:53.878 --> 03:57.412
and so beautifully it is organized within ourselves,

03:57.588 --> 04:04.036
that it is hard to believe that some juggler
was not behind the show.

04:05.525 --> 04:10.192
There must have been some scientist
who has achieved these results.

04:10.395 --> 04:17.496
It could not have  been possible by some special hand

04:21.902 --> 04:28.459
to do these things; I mean if there was no organization,

04:28.637 --> 04:32.260
no thinking behind it, no planning behind it,

04:32.539 --> 04:37.260
and  no powerful personality behind it,

04:37.458 --> 04:41.943
The Almighty,  it could not have been possible.

04:43.650 --> 04:47.783
As science has its limitations, of course, we cannot find out

04:49.029 --> 04:54.361
how it was expedited, how it took place?

04:55.770 --> 05:02.952
But we can see that we have achieved
something in the field of science,

05:03.191 --> 05:11.416
by one method – perhaps that is
the method that was used to trigger this also that fast.

05:13.831 --> 05:18.022
When I was young, as you are, when I was studying Myself

05:18.236 --> 05:20.943
at that time, I could never have believed

05:21.360 --> 05:25.558
that we could ever reach the moon; nobody could have believed.

05:25.737 --> 05:29.604
If anyone would have said that, people would have laughed

05:29.785 --> 05:31.689
at such a conjecture.

05:33.157 --> 05:36.621
Even today if you tell My grandmother, she does not believe it.

05:36.821 --> 05:39.094
She thinks it is just a story you are telling her.

05:39.252 --> 05:41.852
But we have reached the moon, no doubt.

05:42.683 --> 05:53.243
In this system, we have used a very wonderful system

05:54.057 --> 05:59.692
of putting five capsules one into another

06:01.914 --> 06:07.318
and the one capsule, the lowest capsule, explodes

06:08.017 --> 06:11.794
and triggers the movement of the rest of the four .

06:12.191 --> 06:17.012
Then the second one explodes, and gives an acceleration

06:18.381 --> 06:22.548
many more times than it was already moving;

06:24.512 --> 06:29.125
the speed increases in such a tremendous way

06:30.891 --> 06:40.236
that suddenly we find

06:40.971 --> 06:46.228
the acceleration is so multiple of the first one

06:47.141 --> 06:51.830
that the second one, when it explodes,
it gives another push to the capsule.

06:52.549 --> 06:56.251
Then the third one explodes at a point.

06:56.471 --> 07:03.256
Then the fourth one, and the fifth one is the
one that contains the spacecraft.

07:04.227 --> 07:07.889
This kind of explosion from one to another,

07:08.208 --> 07:10.408
through that built-in mechanism,

07:10.619 --> 07:14.369
we have been able to achieve
this tremendous speed and acceleration.

07:14.805 --> 07:17.939
In the same way our evolution has taken place.

07:18.290 --> 07:22.623
We have got this idea, without even knowing about our evolution,

07:22.814 --> 07:27.081
from the unconscious. We have come to know how it has happened,

07:30.002 --> 07:33.707
but we cannot correlate both things together.

07:35.976 --> 07:40.738
So, in the same way a human being was created out of amoebae

07:40.976 --> 07:46.920
or amoebae was created out of all the elements in the same manner.

07:47.960 --> 07:52.828
We can say that we were made again of five capsules.

07:53.106 --> 07:58.026
The first one is the physical, our physical being.

07:58.324 --> 08:05.268
Inside the physical being was kept our mental being.

08:05.527 --> 08:09.127
Inside the mental being was kept the emotional being.

08:09.297 --> 08:13.470
Inside the emotional being was kept the spiritual being

08:13.689 --> 08:17.478
and inside the spiritual being was kept the spirit,

08:20.527 --> 08:22.987
or our attention, you can say.

08:25.468 --> 08:28.845
Kundalini is the one which triggers,

08:30.254 --> 08:33.309
that is the one that explodes.

08:34.341 --> 08:38.808
So Kundalini is in everything: the Kundalini force in everything.

08:39.002 --> 08:45.413
But, the best it is, highest it is,
the most effective it is, is in the human beings.

08:48.072 --> 08:53.879
Because force to evolve

08:58.046 --> 09:03.700
from, say from carbon to amoebae [state/stage]
and amoebae to animal [state/stage]

09:03.900 --> 09:08.887
and animal stage to human stage, exists in everyone.

09:09.899 --> 09:16.007
Even in the elements it exists because elements also evolve.

09:16.167 --> 09:20.233
We do not know how they evolve but it happens in the Nature,

09:20.630 --> 09:24.994
that elements start changing their forms and [UNCLEAR]

09:25.233 --> 09:29.069
and they become different elements.

09:29.767 --> 09:33.512
The mass changes but we have no idea

09:33.657 --> 09:39.411
because we have no way of measuring the [quantity/quantum?]
of this change that is taking place.

09:39.590 --> 09:45.562
Then the animals also change.  Animals change, from… Many fishes,

09:46.991 --> 09:53.734
they become reptiles. Out of reptiles many become mammals.

09:54.369 --> 09:57.464
From mammals, many become human beings;

09:58.278 --> 10:02.611
or you can say that monkeys or quadrupeds and then human beings.

10:03.018 --> 10:06.818
All this happening takes place.  How many are destroyed,

10:06.969 --> 10:10.102
and how many become, how many are transformed,

10:10.253 --> 10:14.320
nobody has measured it and nobody has kept any account of it.

10:15.991 --> 10:21.110
Today, we talk of a population problem.

10:22.320 --> 10:27.588
Perhaps many animals have taken birth.
You can see the effect of that,

10:27.753 --> 10:31.992
the way people are behaving; you can be sure that many animals

10:32.176 --> 10:35.322
must have taken life and they have yet to go

10:35.442 --> 10:37.993
–lot of evolution and training as a human being

10:38.132 --> 10:40.732
to understand the value of human life.

10:42.299 --> 10:47.576
But once a human being starts evolving within himself.

10:49.243 --> 10:52.177
Now we have been human beings, as they say,

10:52.359 --> 10:56.976
for 14,000 years – I think it is even more than that.

10:57.549 --> 11:01.015
So we have been human beings say, for 14,000 years.

11:01.339 --> 11:06.477
We have been inside growing through our freedom,

11:06.755 --> 11:11.036
Human beings are the only people who get freedom

11:13.080 --> 11:16.584
to evolve themselves, to understand

11:17.140 --> 11:20.810
what is wrong and what is bad.

11:23.965 --> 11:30.212
This freedom is granted because
without freedom you cannot go any further.

11:30.470 --> 11:35.841
For example, when you are studying in the schools,
you are told 2 plus 2 is 4.

11:36.179 --> 11:39.714
Then you are given tables and you are told that

11:39.974 --> 11:44.095
2 times tables are like this
– you remember by heart and it is like this.

11:44.273 --> 11:50.451
We do not question that 2 by 10, why is it? 2 into 10 why is it 20?

11:50.688 --> 11:53.864
We do not question, we just go on and on and on.

11:54.023 --> 11:57.230
But when you reach a certain standard of education,

11:57.369 --> 12:01.106
say a graduation or a post graduation standard,

12:01.325 --> 12:04.350
then you are given freedom to write thesis on this subject

12:04.490 --> 12:10.243
– why is it that when you multiply 2 by 10 it is 20?

12:10.640 --> 12:14.440
Because you have reached a certain stage of development.

12:14.589 --> 12:18.722
At this stage you are given freedom to find out for yourself.

12:20.938 --> 12:28.425
That is how you are developed and then by this development only

12:28.624 --> 12:31.957
you can teach the other people who are coming up.

12:32.374 --> 12:34.974
This is the way the evolution has been.

12:37.414 --> 12:40.147
So far you have not felt your evolution:

12:40.730 --> 12:43.796
from amoebae to this stage you have not felt.

12:44.455 --> 12:47.521
You do not know how you became a human being,

12:48.031 --> 12:51.898
you just take it for granted.  Even if you see your eyes,

12:52.089 --> 12:53.755
they are so complicated.

12:54.310 --> 12:58.510
It is such a complicated organ that if you start studying them

12:58.636 --> 13:01.178
you will be amazed how things are made.

13:01.278 --> 13:06.344
If you just prick a pin in my finger,
immediately there is a reflex action.

13:06.555 --> 13:15.010
It is so nicely built, it is so nicely arranged;
it is so quick, it is so efficient,

13:15.465 --> 13:19.027
that one is surprised and amazed

13:19.307 --> 13:23.973
at the wonders of this kind of organization,
that is this human body.

13:24.406 --> 13:29.072
But you see what human beings are,
they are inefficiency personified.

13:29.505 --> 13:33.238
I sent four telegrams to my daughter and today she says

13:33.473 --> 13:36.607
that she received one telegram after one month.

13:40.157 --> 13:43.914
Human beings have been given freedom to understand

13:44.113 --> 13:49.509
and to develop their own efficiency,
to receive the ultimate knowledge

13:50.553 --> 13:57.477
of the Creator of this creation, the powers of this Creator.

13:59.601 --> 14:05.446
And that is why a Kundalini is placed in the human beings alone.

14:05.744 --> 14:13.244
Though there is Kundalini force and there is
Kundalini in another form in everything else that exists,

14:13.463 --> 14:17.063
only in the human being, when they get their freedom,

14:18.769 --> 14:30.753
this force is kept in the triangular bone,
dormant, to trigger the last jumping into the unknown.

14:35.486 --> 14:39.315
Now this is there, this Kundalini exists.

14:40.756 --> 14:49.548
But to begin with, if I say, before starting all this creation,

14:52.167 --> 14:57.226
who was created first, is most interesting and may not be

14:57.882 --> 15:00.748
very congenial to the mind of a scientist.

15:01.842 --> 15:04.775
It is much beyond science I am talking now,

15:04.977 --> 15:13.290
that much before anything was created on this Earth,

15:13.964 --> 15:15.749
Holiness was created

15:18.608 --> 15:20.475
– what we call the Parviti.

15:21.894 --> 15:26.298
Shri Ganesha is the deity of that Holiness.

15:26.735 --> 15:31.556
God has created this Holiness to protect His creation.

15:32.727 --> 15:36.687
This atmosphere of Holiness He created to protect

15:38.017 --> 15:43.234
all the people, all the creative things which have been there,

15:43.790 --> 15:47.580
which have been created by Him, otherwise

15:48.247 --> 15:49.913
nothing would work out.

15:50.727 --> 15:59.576
Just think if one of the Oceans was deeper even by 10 feet,

16:00.551 --> 16:03.618
the balance of Earth would have toppled down;

16:03.963 --> 16:11.391
just imagine what a speed this Mother Earth has,

16:11.912 --> 16:16.495
it revolves with such a tremendous speed, goes round the Sun

16:16.654 --> 16:22.943
regularly in a proper way, not in a round way,

16:23.142 --> 16:25.542
but in a special style as you know.

16:29.109 --> 16:34.792
She creates day and night for you: night to rest and day to work.

16:35.546 --> 16:40.327
How She Herself has created this beautiful atmosphere for you

16:40.844 --> 16:45.910
and has maintained the balance
and the temperature that was given to Her,

16:47.371 --> 16:52.371
is only done by the power of Holiness that was created around.

16:52.820 --> 16:57.542
Now, man in his foolishness is challenging that Holiness.

17:02.780 --> 17:04.980
He thinks he can challenge God.

17:06.681 --> 17:09.214
That’s the sign of his [dwarfness?].

17:10.014 --> 17:17.526
If he had risen that high where
he could feel God pulsating in everything,

17:17.684 --> 17:19.787
he would never have done that.

17:19.947 --> 17:23.413
But before he could reach that state of perfection,

17:23.875 --> 17:26.209
he has started talking about God.

17:27.447 --> 17:32.260
Who is going to challenge his authority of this stupid man,

17:32.717 --> 17:37.538
who doesn’t want to achieve his perfection and wants to talk big?

17:43.441 --> 17:51.340
All pervading power is there of Holiness which corrects,

17:53.722 --> 18:00.289
which guides, which co-ordinates, which loves

18:01.559 --> 18:07.474
and which organizes everything for you to get

18:09.200 --> 18:11.928
this awakening within you.

19:37.122 --> 19:45.477
So one must understand how Kundalini awakening
is the most important thing that has to happen.

19:45.887 --> 19:52.739
Kundalini awakening is the only way
you are going to know your spirit, your Atma.

19:52.993 --> 19:59.633
This is the most important happening in the history of creation.

20:00.434 --> 20:04.501
It’s like the garden you spread out; you lay out the garden,

20:04.984 --> 20:10.859
you put down everything, you plant the trees,

20:11.114 --> 20:16.447
the trees have the flowers and now the time has come,
the fruits must appear.

20:17.305 --> 20:21.838
It’s the most important thing and has to happen to every individual

20:22.500 --> 20:25.566
who is seeking the Truth.

20:26.465 --> 20:30.527
The trouble with truth is, that that also you have to see

20:30.782 --> 20:33.476
with humility in your own freedom.

20:33.828 --> 20:36.962
Nobody can hypnotize people for seeking truth;

20:37.852 --> 20:41.660
those who are hypnotized cannot understand.

20:42.167 --> 20:45.238
In all your awareness, in all your freedom,

20:45.495 --> 20:48.695
in all your understanding, in all your dignity,

20:48.867 --> 20:51.467
you have to get the knowledge of truth.

20:51.805 --> 20:55.858
But it is not just giving you a lecture that
you are going to understand.

20:56.016 --> 21:00.543
It is not brainwashing – that has been
done by all nonsensical people throughout.

21:00.953 --> 21:06.420
It is the happening, the actualization
by which you reach that state of awareness

21:06.637 --> 21:16.715
by which you develop the dynamics of collective consciousness.

21:18.609 --> 21:21.031
Collective consciousness.

21:22.027 --> 21:25.659
By which you become collectively conscious:

21:27.965 --> 21:32.847
is an awareness which develops within you

21:34.098 --> 21:37.026
– is real actualization.

21:38.883 --> 21:41.616
As you are a human being, you know that,

21:42.418 --> 21:46.695
when this capsule of human being was triggered,

21:47.184 --> 21:50.308
you got lots of things as your awareness,

21:50.524 --> 21:54.996
more than that of animals. ‘The University itself;

21:56.149 --> 21:58.615
animals don’t have any universities.

22:00.543 --> 22:02.810
Animals don’t understand gardens,

22:03.375 --> 22:07.975
they don’t understand dirt and filth, they don’t understand beauty.

22:08.942 --> 22:12.320
All this has come to you, built within you,

22:12.731 --> 22:15.797
manifested as soon as you became human beings.

22:18.673 --> 22:23.375
So, as soon as you become the super human being,

22:23.961 --> 22:32.277
you become aware of yourself within
and you become aware of others within.

22:33.351 --> 22:36.511
This is the collective consciousness,

22:36.687 --> 22:39.343
this is what Sahaja Yoga is.

22:40.671 --> 22:43.737
Sahaja Yoga is the system of nature.

22:45.300 --> 22:50.124
Is the system; the way this creation took place is also Sahaj:

22:50.515 --> 22:54.913
Built in – Sahaja. ‘Sah’ means with, ‘ja’ means born.

22:55.205 --> 22:58.539
Everything is within you like a seed if you see.

22:58.702 --> 23:02.940
Seed has a primule within it to sprout.

23:04.092 --> 23:10.826
Seed has the complete [ path?] of the tree
that it is going to be and the trees it is going to be.

23:11.182 --> 23:15.582
The whole thing is in the seed, in the same way in the human seed

23:15.765 --> 23:19.699
the whole picture of what he is going to be is built in.

23:20.166 --> 23:22.900
The whole mechanism is placed within him.

23:23.291 --> 23:27.974
Now there are the undercurrents of your being,

23:28.190 --> 23:32.404
which I’ve been describing this evening to you.

23:32.561 --> 23:35.861
What are the forces that have built up human beings,

23:35.979 --> 23:39.084
which are inside him. Only thing I would like to say

23:39.202 --> 23:41.535
that you are like a computer made;

23:41.662 --> 23:43.712
you are already made like a computer,

23:43.811 --> 23:46.701
only thing is you are to be put to the mains.

23:46.877 --> 23:51.174
If you are put to the mains then
the computer starts working by itself,

23:51.409 --> 23:56.142
but it is not the way you understand a machine.
You are a human being,

23:56.838 --> 23:58.638
and you know what is love.

23:58.947 --> 24:01.547
To a scientist I cannot talk of love.

24:01.721 --> 24:05.002
I am talking of Divine Holiness,

24:05.139 --> 24:07.739
the love of God which has created you,

24:07.882 --> 24:09.815
which wants you to know Him.

24:12.170 --> 24:16.447
Through science you cannot love.

24:18.010 --> 24:20.978
Every scientist must be loving somebody

24:21.174 --> 24:23.974
– if not his children at least, his dog.

24:24.319 --> 24:27.404
He must be loving flowers: if not flowers,

24:27.561 --> 24:29.628
he might be loving his horses,

24:29.827 --> 24:31.627
but he knows what is love.

24:31.843 --> 24:34.611
And if he can understand that spark of love,

24:34.748 --> 24:36.681
from where it has come,

24:38.245 --> 24:43.611
love that I am talking about is a synthesis of all these powers.

24:43.983 --> 24:48.490
Science deals with only a very little [of it?].

24:49.721 --> 24:58.646
I will also tell you which part of this power deals

24:59.389 --> 25:08.256
with our physical being and out of
which how much a scientist knows.

25:08.530 --> 25:12.611
You will be surprised – if knowledge is an Ocean,

25:12.998 --> 25:16.064
the scientist knows only a drop.

25:18.038 --> 25:26.182
And to know the Ocean, the drop is to be dissolved in the Ocean.

25:26.826 --> 25:31.629
But the drop cannot by his effort, become the Ocean

25:31.959 --> 25:37.092
– the Ocean has to dissolve the drop.
And that is what Ocean has to do it,

25:37.366 --> 25:47.166
if His creation has to have its fulfilment
and His beautiful creation is

25:49.392 --> 25:53.299
manifested in the human being.

25:53.963 --> 25:57.674
The human being must find out his fulfilment.

25:57.870 --> 26:00.403
If he cannot find out his fulfilment,

26:01.864 --> 26:08.075
he cannot reach any perfection in any one of his endeavours

26:08.583 --> 26:13.442
and God Himself will not rest till he does that.

26:13.813 --> 26:17.347
Because who would like to destroy one’s own creation

26:18.188 --> 26:24.731
of thousands and thousands of years of a pre-planned thing.

26:26.079 --> 26:29.379
This has to come to its fulfilment

26:29.770 --> 26:32.582
and if it is to be done by Me,

26:32.855 --> 26:36.819
if I am the person who is supposed to trigger your Kundalini,

26:36.997 --> 26:39.397
why should you have any objection?

26:42.251 --> 26:44.571
Thank God, I was not a scientist;

26:44.727 --> 26:48.794
otherwise I would have finished my life making an atom bomb.

26:50.333 --> 26:56.600
Thank God, I am not a psychologist;
otherwise I would have gone mad, listening to mad people.

26:57.325 --> 27:01.993
Thank God, I am not a politician, you know how they are.

27:03.985 --> 27:07.585
Thank God, I am none of these, I am just your Mother;

27:10.743 --> 27:15.332
concerned, absolutely concerned,

27:15.801 --> 27:21.309
about your ultimate well being and not superficial things.

27:23.614 --> 27:29.414
We’ll have the meditation now
– that’s more important than any one of these lectures.

27:29.595 --> 27:32.995
I’ve already given 84 tapes to these London people

27:33.384 --> 27:37.153
– I’ve been speaking and speaking, every day two to three lectures.

27:37.290 --> 27:39.090
Best thing is to have it.

27:40.259 --> 27:44.592
Now some of you who do not get it should not get upset with Me.

27:45.285 --> 27:48.619
If you do not get it, there is nothing to worry.

27:48.782 --> 27:54.524
If you get it, well and good.  If you don’t get it,
you’ll get it this evening, if not tomorrow.

27:54.993 --> 27:58.899
It is a very subtle happening: should happen to you.

27:59.895 --> 28:05.579
If it happens, immediately you’ll find the relaxation will come.

28:05.870 --> 28:08.060
But the best thing that happens to you

28:08.258 --> 28:12.477
is first of all is your physical being is absolutely [different?]

28:12.672 --> 28:16.806
Now this lady now has come here with a very serious disease.

28:16.970 --> 28:25.657
If she had come to Me earlier
– [Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi to someone]…

28:26.090 --> 28:30.656
So if this lady had come to Me at the end,
she would never have [UNCLEAR].

28:31.145 --> 28:35.890
If she had come to Me and got her realization,

28:36.067 --> 28:41.333
she would have been alright today.
But she said she did not know about it.

28:42.375 --> 28:45.909
What’s the use of getting ill and then coming to Me,

28:46.125 --> 28:49.539
asking for My blessing and all sorts of things

28:49.890 --> 28:53.190
instead of getting your realization or

28:53.455 --> 28:57.215
in keeping your very good health to begin with?

28:57.371 --> 28:59.638
It comes to you as a by product.

28:59.950 --> 29:02.350
That comes to you as a by product.

29:02.918 --> 29:05.230
It is not done through Me.  Because,

29:05.484 --> 29:09.409
say now, how you have decorated when I’m coming in here

29:09.632 --> 29:12.632
– in the same way, if the light has to come,

29:13.355 --> 29:18.003
the Divine has to shine, your own body is cleansed.

29:18.550 --> 29:21.851
Is beautified and is made healthy;

29:22.242 --> 29:25.975
that’s as a by product.   But that’s not the ultimate.

29:27.457 --> 29:32.790
The light has to come within you,
the reality has to be pulsating within you;

29:33.335 --> 29:38.726
unless and until that happens, everything else has no meaning.

29:40.522 --> 29:44.322
The other things that can happen is if you are mentally…

29:44.507 --> 29:49.958
Also upset – or as I have said,
the physical, the mental, the emotional,

29:50.330 --> 29:55.896
then the spiritual – and then beyond that is the state

29:56.131 --> 30:00.755
of complete bliss, of collective consciousness is established:

30:00.951 --> 30:02.951
In the space you are thrown.

30:03.132 --> 30:05.799
In the same way, it happens within you,

30:06.132 --> 30:12.103
so naturally all these things are
[UNCLEAR –exploded?] and normalised

30:13.217 --> 30:16.350
and the ultimate is established in the space.

30:16.849 --> 30:22.418
Whatever is useless or sick falls off.

30:22.692 --> 30:24.892
Whatever is beautiful comes up.

30:25.382 --> 30:29.918
As in the tree, you have seen that when the fruit comes up,

30:30.114 --> 30:32.114
so many things have to drop.

30:32.243 --> 30:37.028
In the same way, all that is not wanted drops out

30:37.224 --> 30:42.301
and all that is required shows itself and manifests.

30:42.632 --> 30:46.206
It’s a very beautiful happening – it should happen to all of you

30:46.384 --> 30:50.309
– but again I would like to tell you,
it is a very subtle happening.

30:50.427 --> 30:52.027
It was never this way.

30:52.673 --> 30:56.806
Only for the first time that it has started working this way;

30:57.009 --> 31:05.313
that it is given to people who are [Sanskrit?]

31:05.625 --> 31:10.215
– who are simple people, ordinary people, leading a very

31:10.381 --> 31:15.332
simple life.  Because it has to happen that way because,

31:15.841 --> 31:21.954
supposing there is a discovery of electricity

31:22.735 --> 31:26.813
by one person, which has a big history behind it.

31:27.009 --> 31:32.609
And he discovers something, and
he does not make it useful for the common people.

31:33.142 --> 31:36.008
If the common people cannot benefit by it,

31:36.344 --> 31:40.407
if the ordinary people cannot understand it, it has no meaning.

31:40.602 --> 31:45.582
In the same way, Sahaja Yoga has to go to common people;

31:45.817 --> 31:51.563
everybody must understand.  Otherwise,
people like Christ were crucified – nobody understood Him.

31:51.740 --> 31:54.406
People like Kabira, nobody understood.

31:54.708 --> 31:56.975
People like Nanaka was tortured.

31:57.677 --> 32:00.744
People like Mohammed-Sahib was given poisons,

32:01.115 --> 32:07.181
and every one of them had to just suffer
because of the ignorance of the common people.

32:07.632 --> 32:11.499
Today, the time has come for common people to be realised.

32:14.985 --> 32:19.981
Let’s try how many of you get it.
If you get it, then it’s a subtle thing,

32:20.132 --> 32:25.254
but to settle into Sahaja Yoga, you have to practise.

32:25.470 --> 32:30.039
You have to come at least once a month – at least minimum –

32:30.216 --> 32:34.149
to a general program, because it is a collective program.

32:34.278 --> 32:40.371
It’s a common program, and that’s
why it is going to work out in Collective;

32:40.781 --> 32:43.581
individually it’s not going to work out.

32:43.731 --> 32:46.065
Individually it’s very difficult.

32:46.212 --> 32:50.547
As you know about Hatha yogis

32:50.882 --> 32:53.321
– how they have to stay in the jungle.

32:53.477 --> 32:58.164
Before they were twenty five years of age,
Hatha Yoga was to work out with [UNCLEAR Ashtang?]

32:58.282 --> 33:02.008
Not the way the modern hatha yoga is all wrong:
Absolutely wrong.  It should not be

33:02.164 --> 33:03.551
– it’s the wrong style.

33:03.688 --> 33:09.879
Because this kind of Hatha yoga takes your attention only to
your physical being and gives you an imbalance.

33:09.997 --> 33:14.508
The other day I had somebody who was a great Hatha yogi
and he had a heart attack.

33:14.723 --> 33:17.551
So he told Me he got a heart attack after Hatha yoga.

33:17.774 --> 33:19.542
So I said then what did he do?  So he said,

33:19.738 --> 33:23.288
‘They gave me another yoga to remove this heart attack.’

33:23.445 --> 33:26.980
And when he came here for Me, he was shaking, just like this.

33:27.098 --> 33:29.222
So I told him, ask for the man who is shaking,

33:29.362 --> 33:33.162
and this man was a possessed man from a lunatic asylum.

33:33.246 --> 33:35.277
I said, ‘This is what has happened to your nerves.

33:35.394 --> 33:38.460
Who are asking to break your neck for nothing at all?

33:38.598 --> 33:41.175
There was no need for you to go to such an extreme.

33:41.323 --> 33:44.339
You should have just waited; you would have got your realisation.’

33:44.457 --> 33:46.898
Of course, [UNCLEAR Asanas?] also have a place,

33:47.016 --> 33:49.671
but you must understand the complete shastra:

33:49.808 --> 33:55.528
Complete science of all these things must be understood.

33:55.685 --> 33:59.200
But that is after realisation, not before.

34:00.118 --> 34:02.828
For example, you are suffering from stomach trouble

34:02.946 --> 34:05.231
and if you start using an asana for your neck,

34:05.342 --> 34:08.844
you’ve had it: your neck will be gone
and then your stomach will be [next?].

34:09.020 --> 34:11.220
So there is a big science behind

34:11.384 --> 34:14.938
and those who understand the science will not use it for such a

34:15.056 --> 34:18.922
long time, every day, religiously – there is no need to.

34:19.528 --> 34:23.043
Whenever there is some need, then only take the medicine.

34:23.220 --> 34:27.028
Do you go on staying in a medicine shop all your life,

34:27.204 --> 34:28.604
just to keep healthy?

34:29.801 --> 34:31.734
Same thing is about Mantra.

34:31.882 --> 34:35.055
Mantra also has got a very big science;

34:35.290 --> 34:38.024
once you understand that science that is [UNCLEAR].

34:38.181 --> 34:41.514
Without realisation, mantra also has no meaning.

34:41.735 --> 34:45.602
Those who give you mantras are people who are [UNCLEAR]

34:45.777 --> 34:48.862
They don’t understand any meaning of mantra, I can tell you.

34:49.001 --> 34:55.289
Because I have seen, the way they are knowing the chakras
and things, and the Kundalini doesn’t rise.

34:55.524 --> 34:58.924
The basic thing is that your Kundalini must rise.

34:59.138 --> 35:03.604
Those people who spoil your Kundalini, I do not like them at all.

35:04.149 --> 35:07.016
Some of them spoil because they are naïve;

35:07.235 --> 35:12.502
they don’t know what to do about Kundalini
because they are not authorised.

35:12.763 --> 35:15.926
They are not holy people, they are not realised souls.

35:16.063 --> 35:18.954
They are not supposed to do it, so they spoil your Kundalini.

35:19.110 --> 35:23.270
They make money out of it,
because anybody can sell anything, you see.

35:23.427 --> 35:26.238
Anybody can say, ‘I am a Kundalini awakener.’

35:26.356 --> 35:28.690
What can you do about the [fuss?]

35:28.954 --> 35:31.746
God is not going to come and arrest you for that.

35:31.883 --> 35:35.926
You are arrested, in a way, but that’s a very subtle [UNCLEAR]

35:36.044 --> 35:41.444
which nobody understands.
That these are the punishments of our wrongdoing.

35:42.099 --> 35:47.332
Those who try to do it in a naïve way can be forgiven.

35:47.528 --> 35:52.723
Even those who make money, I can forgive them,
because this is a silly thing that’s going on everywhere.

35:52.882 --> 35:56.815
But those who do it deliberately are definitely the devils

35:57.001 --> 35:59.334
– I call them Danavas, Rakshasas.

35:59.714 --> 36:02.937
Because deliberately to spoil somebody’s Kundalini,

36:03.095 --> 36:09.774
just to entice them, and to hypnotise them to use for
your own purpose, is absolutely Satanic:

36:09.970 --> 36:14.269
is against the purpose of God and that’s
why I’ll call them as the Devil.

36:14.445 --> 36:20.312
So, let us have the experience
– you put your hands towards Me and… [tape fades out]
