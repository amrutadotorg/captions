Diwali Puja Talk November 1, 1981 Chelsham Road Ashram, London, UK

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Today I told you about the importance of Lakshmi principle

00:00:12.914 --> 00:00:14.914
within us and

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.722
and the three processes

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.099
through which we pass.

00:00:24.283 --> 00:00:26.776
First is the Gruha Lakshmi.

00:00:28.332 --> 00:00:30.332
Actually, this is celebrated mostly on the thirteenth day

00:00:29.736 --> 00:00:31.736
of the moon, where they say that

00:00:31.824 --> 00:00:33.824
the housewife has to be given some present.

00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:35.866
And the best thing she can have is a some sort of an utensil.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So people give her some utensils, actually

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
it’s a very mutual thing, because

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
if you give an utensil, she is supposed to cook for you.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
It’s a very sweet way of suggesting that you cook something for us.

00:01:11.386 --> 00:01:15.343
Then the fourteenth day is very important,

00:01:15.849 --> 00:01:24.531
because that is the day the Goddess as a power,

00:01:25.059 --> 00:01:31.680
as a power, because it was Kartikeya who killed Narakasura, the devil.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.402
And he was one of the worst of all, could not be killed.

00:01:41.455 --> 00:01:45.584
So Shiva and Parvati were married

00:01:45.667 --> 00:01:50.885
for this special purpose to produce this powerful Shaktiputra,

00:01:50.916 --> 00:01:55.037
means the son of the Shakti, known as Kartikeya.

00:01:56.922 --> 00:02:00.484
And He was just born to kill this horrible devil,

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.420
called as Narakasura.

00:02:04.626 --> 00:02:09.385
And He killed. That is the day, fourteenth day.

00:02:09.934 --> 00:02:11.934
It is something like Halloween, that day.

00:02:12.612 --> 00:02:14.612
Because that is the day they opened

00:02:15.156 --> 00:02:21.737
the gates of hell and put all the devils into hell.

00:02:22.177 --> 00:02:28.057
And that’s why that day one has to rest in the morning time as long as possible.

00:02:28.307 --> 00:02:31.907
So that let all the devils be put in nicely

00:02:32.185 --> 00:02:36.274
because some of them might be hanging around still.

00:02:36.934 --> 00:02:40.124
It’s better to allow them to get out.

00:02:40.668 --> 00:02:43.147
I mean in the realm that you are

00:02:43.373 --> 00:02:45.860
you do not feel much their existence.

00:02:46.027 --> 00:02:49.981
But if you were in the realm of subconscious area or collective subconscious,

00:02:51.547 --> 00:02:54.123
people see even some of the spirits

00:02:54.193 --> 00:02:56.198
and also can feel their existence,

00:02:56.278 --> 00:02:58.138
they see the black spots and all that.

00:03:00.305 --> 00:03:04.276
So that day is very dangerous,

00:03:04.623 --> 00:03:08.005
but because Narakasura was killed,

00:03:09.954 --> 00:03:12.043
people celebrated.

00:03:12.142 --> 00:03:17.218
That celebration is expressed next day,

00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:21.905
which that day is the day of Diwali they say.

00:03:21.944 --> 00:03:25.868
That is the day they also worship Lakshmi, because

00:03:26.743 --> 00:03:29.217
they think that

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.429
that’s the day Lakshmi was born on this earth

00:03:33.223 --> 00:03:36.830
from the sea as I told you last time.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.447
Then the day of the New Year comes in afterwards,

00:03:44.164 --> 00:03:47.356
because in India in the north,

00:03:47.567 --> 00:03:50.759
that’s the time people finish their crops

00:03:51.576 --> 00:03:56.440
and they found that day was very good to celebrate the New Year.

00:03:57.488 --> 00:03:58.226
And,

00:04:01.152 --> 00:04:07.155
that is actually more, sort of, we can say is a social thing in India,

00:04:07.412 --> 00:04:09.701
we need not use that,

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.915
what ever suits us. You can have your own New Year. Because in the south,

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.940
say in Maharastra they have another New Year, as I told you where

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:24.759
Shalivahana in his dynasty started another

00:04:25.076 --> 00:04:27.483
calendar and they celebrate that.

00:04:28.217 --> 00:04:30.849
So all these things are nothing is rigid

00:04:31.583 --> 00:04:34.214
about anything, one must know. Nothing is rigid.

00:04:35.182 --> 00:04:37.813
Rigidity comes from ignorance.

00:04:38.489 --> 00:04:41.632
It’s all for you, for your joy and happiness.

00:04:41.891 --> 00:04:44.418
The whole festival system is for your happiness

00:04:44.603 --> 00:04:48.225
and not for the happiness of the time or date.

00:04:48.536 --> 00:04:52.550
It’s for you, so it should be adjustable according to your

00:04:53.713 --> 00:04:56.625
needs and understanding.

00:04:57.984 --> 00:05:00.896
And also according to your

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.120
national way you live.

00:05:04.313 --> 00:05:08.260
They should be no addiction to any

00:05:08.277 --> 00:05:13.109
particular type of culture, a particular type of ideas.

00:05:13.441 --> 00:05:16.822
It’s all for you. All these festivals are for you, not for gods.

00:05:17.101 --> 00:05:18.745
They don’t have these festivals.

00:05:19.153 --> 00:05:22.060
It’s only for you people these festivals are there.

00:05:22.285 --> 00:05:26.203
And when you celebrate them, that’s only for your joy and your happiness.

00:05:26.562 --> 00:05:29.020
And that’s how you should celebrate in a way

00:05:29.243 --> 00:05:32.999
that gives you the greatest amount of happiness.

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:37.506
And the festivals, all the festivals of the world must be celebrated.

00:05:37.818 --> 00:05:40.378
The more you are festive, the happier it is.

00:05:41.155 --> 00:05:43.769
Why miss the chance, you see.

00:05:44.162 --> 00:05:49.800
So as Sahaja Yogis you can celebrate, you can’t put yourselves in yawn.

00:06:02.783 --> 00:06:06.460
So as a Sahaja Yogi you don’t belong to any particular

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:09.937
caste or community anymore now, you belong to universal caste.

00:06:10.133 --> 00:06:13.512
Once you start belonging to the universal thing,

00:06:13.718 --> 00:06:16.763
then you can celebrate all the festivals of all the religions.

00:06:16.963 --> 00:06:18.714
And have the best of it.

00:06:20.634 --> 00:06:24.164
All the year out, you can celebrate all the festivals. Know about them,

00:06:24.396 --> 00:06:26.526
the more you know, the better it is.

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:29.251
And have all kinds of sweets,

00:06:29.461 --> 00:06:32.840
whatever you use, whatever type you use, in whatever

00:06:33.146 --> 00:06:36.542
areas and countries and cultures. And that’s how

00:06:36.515 --> 00:06:42.497
we have to be more festive.

00:06:43.702 --> 00:06:47.097
Now the last day is very important,

00:06:47.246 --> 00:06:50.092
is a very universal day I should say, called as

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:53.705
Bhaiya Duja, this day,

00:06:53.671 --> 00:06:56.453
or they call it also in Marathi Vao Dijum,

00:06:56.918 --> 00:07:00.313
different names. The brothers and sisters day.

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:10.434
Now the brothers’ and sisters’ relationship

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:16.440
has to be very, very strong. And the purity of that relationship

00:07:16.974 --> 00:07:18.376
is to be maintained.

00:07:19.516 --> 00:07:23.027
It is not necessary that you should be born as brothers and sisters,

00:07:23.387 --> 00:07:24.470
not necessary.

00:07:25.231 --> 00:07:28.380
But you are born, because if you are

00:07:28.548 --> 00:07:31.427
realized souls you are born as brothers and sisters.

00:07:32.028 --> 00:07:35.906
So that purity must be maintained in the society of Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:36.406 --> 00:07:42.303
Very important, that we should try to develop this

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:48.083
situation that brothers and sisters

00:07:48.407 --> 00:07:53.369
are something very pure. Their relationships are very pure.

00:07:54.007 --> 00:07:58.903
And they should not be at all challenged.

00:07:59.308 --> 00:08:02.832
It is so much so that even if you call somebody your brother,

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:08.119
he is your brother and the more you develop this relationship,

00:08:08.471 --> 00:08:13.351
the better your left Vishuddhi will be. Because left Vishuddhi

00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:17.540
is the relationship with God as a brother

00:08:17.787 --> 00:08:20.344
or with a Goddess as a sister.

00:08:21.595 --> 00:08:26.662
So, Shri Krishna’s sister, as you know was

00:08:26.908 --> 00:08:30.360
born to Nand

00:08:30.604 --> 00:08:34.055
and Shri Krishna himself was born in a prison.

00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:38.000
So there was an exchange that took place.

00:08:38.862 --> 00:08:43.838
They had to replace Her in His place.

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:49.798
And then when Kamsa,

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:55.882
the uncle of Krishna, tried to kill that girl,

00:08:56.141 --> 00:08:58.141
She went into the sky

00:08:58.785 --> 00:09:03.238
and like a lightning She said that “Your killer is still living in Gokul,

00:09:03.583 --> 00:09:07.842
is still there.” So this lightning that we see,

00:09:08.298 --> 00:09:11.582
is representative of that power,

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:16.820
which we call as Vishnumaya, is the sister’s. If your sisterly feelings

00:09:17.014 --> 00:09:20.560
towards women are good and strong,

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:26.129
your left Vishuddhi will be very good.

00:09:26.533 --> 00:09:28.533
It has many other qualities.

00:09:28.893 --> 00:09:31.780
For example a person, who has a very good left Vishuddi,

00:09:32.533 --> 00:09:34.533
is a very confident person.

00:09:36.027 --> 00:09:39.109
Not only that, but whatever he says comes out true.

00:09:42.252 --> 00:09:44.783
Even by mistake, he says something, it comes true.

00:09:46.485 --> 00:09:49.798
It’s a very powerful center left Vishuddhi is.

00:09:51.713 --> 00:10:00.376
Such a person, whenever he speaks to, say, criticize something

00:10:01.119 --> 00:10:04.639
or to cut down something or to be against something,

00:10:05.106 --> 00:10:08.188
then it has the power to crash

00:10:09.216 --> 00:10:15.087
all that he doesn’t want. See like, you can say

00:10:16.471 --> 00:10:19.643
Christ, His left Vishuddhi

00:10:19.907 --> 00:10:23.789
is expressed through His relationship with Mary Magdalene.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.100
When He stood up and said that

00:10:30.791 --> 00:10:35.399
“Those who have not committed any sin can stone her,” so this is His power.

00:10:37.164 --> 00:10:42.328
The sin of the people just crashed them completely;

00:10:42.395 --> 00:10:45.884
they were finished, because the sin was there. And the sin was

00:10:46.106 --> 00:10:51.403
of left Vishuddhi. There was no purity. And when there is no purity,

00:10:51.621 --> 00:10:54.442
the person who is so pure says such a thing,

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:58.953
all these people lost their powers; they couldn’t even stone.

00:11:00.767 --> 00:11:06.143
Now this sister of His was born later on as Draupadi

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:10.147
and that to very near the place we have been to, Vani,

00:11:10.255 --> 00:11:15.069
you know, where we saw. Gavin do you remember when we were going to Nagpur?

00:11:15.232 --> 00:11:23.074
Near Vani she was born, that place and there’s a very big temple of that.

00:11:23.914 --> 00:11:29.058
She was called as Draupadi and you know how Shri Krishna tried to save

00:11:29.136 --> 00:11:31.136
Her chastity.

00:11:32.253 --> 00:11:35.878
Now people,

00:11:37.113 --> 00:11:42.317
I have heard, are trying also to say things against Mary Magdalene

00:11:42.695 --> 00:11:46.991
and against Christ and all kinds of things, you see. This is the sign of

00:11:47.008 --> 00:11:51.061
the decadence of our brains and of our morality

00:11:51.182 --> 00:11:54.747
that we cannot see purity in any relationship.

00:11:56.226 --> 00:11:59.510
We cannot see any purity in any relationship.

00:12:00.526 --> 00:12:03.419
So we as sahaja yogis have to develop

00:12:03.919 --> 00:12:08.057
more of that. Instead of that what I find that people,

00:12:08.557 --> 00:12:12.272
specially in the West, try to think whom we are going to marry whom.

00:12:13.682 --> 00:12:16.012
These relationships are established, is wrong.

00:12:18.189 --> 00:12:21.632
There is no need to go on organizing marriages

00:12:21.792 --> 00:12:24.988
and playing these games of romance and all that.

00:12:25.852 --> 00:12:27.994
If marriage has to take place, it will take place.

00:12:28.494 --> 00:12:30.677
But don’t spoil the atmosphere.

00:12:30.767 --> 00:12:33.142
There are some people who are just like

00:12:34.143 --> 00:12:37.507
barbers, who try to organize marriages

00:12:38.599 --> 00:12:41.083
you see and take a great pride in arranging marriages

00:12:41.082 --> 00:12:43.416
with this one to that one and that one to that one.

00:12:43.597 --> 00:12:46.533
Is not a desirable thing; one should not do it. There’s no

00:12:49.491 --> 00:12:53.058
virtue in these things, is to organize marriages all the time.

00:12:53.922 --> 00:12:55.922
When the marriage time comes,

00:12:55.921 --> 00:12:56.872
it takes place.

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.600
Now at the time of Mohammed Sahib

00:13:00.692 --> 00:13:06.825
a big question arose, because there were very few man

00:13:06.966 --> 00:13:09.658
many ladies of all age groups.

00:13:10.158 --> 00:13:12.346
And they didn’t know what to do, how to save these girls

00:13:12.618 --> 00:13:15.308
because so many men died in the war.

00:13:16.582 --> 00:13:21.427
So then they asked, “What to do now at this juncture in a position, when such

00:13:22.564 --> 00:13:24.879
a catastrophe is there and so many women are

00:13:24.924 --> 00:13:28.306
there, and very, very few men?” Then He said, “All right, you can marry

00:13:28.533 --> 00:13:32.296
four or five wives and you can marry in any age group.”

00:13:32.386 --> 00:13:34.386
Because if you have to

00:13:34.886 --> 00:13:38.983
live with dharma, means marriage, means collective sanction,

00:13:39.483 --> 00:13:41.483
not without marriage.

00:13:41.664 --> 00:13:43.664
So He said, “All right, you can even marry five times,

00:13:44.119 --> 00:13:46.494
but you must marry, without marriage you cannot live.”

00:13:48.997 --> 00:13:50.997
And that is why He was particular

00:13:51.497 --> 00:13:55.463
that every person should be married and should have no relationship

00:13:55.508 --> 00:13:56.895
without marriage, was sin.

00:13:58.463 --> 00:14:00.480
Instead of that now Muslims think that it

00:14:00.525 --> 00:14:01.783
is there right to marry five persons.

00:14:01.828 --> 00:14:04.196
I mean, when the men are more and women are less.

00:14:06.835 --> 00:14:09.973
Is a wrong thing. You have to find out the solution.

00:14:10.336 --> 00:14:14.835
And at that time the relationship between

00:14:15.846 --> 00:14:19.066
even the sisters and brothers had to delimit,

00:14:19.566 --> 00:14:20.914
because there was a big problem.

00:14:21.565 --> 00:14:26.561
So He said, “All right, the children born of the same parents cannot marry,

00:14:27.061 --> 00:14:29.844
but cousins could marry,” that time.

00:14:31.573 --> 00:14:33.951
Now that time is changed, all right,

00:14:34.451 --> 00:14:36.546
it’s not that time. We are not on war,

00:14:37.046 --> 00:14:40.405
there is nothing happening like that. There is no such problem.

00:14:40.905 --> 00:14:42.905
So let us develop now our

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.837
pure relationship of brothers and sisters.

00:14:46.973 --> 00:14:49.685
Actually, first time when we had this

00:14:49.912 --> 00:14:52.633
this Diwali function, I asked people

00:14:53.133 --> 00:14:55.133
to find one sister for yourself.

00:14:55.861 --> 00:14:57.861
Every gentleman must have one sister,

00:14:59.089 --> 00:15:06.560
to find out one. And then that is the day, I said, let us start this way

00:15:06.741 --> 00:15:12.568
that next time when we meet on another day called as

00:15:14.297 --> 00:15:16.297
Rakhi Purnima,

00:15:16.478 --> 00:15:20.075
that you tie the rakhi in the hand, the same brothers and sisters.

00:15:21.303 --> 00:15:23.808
In India also we did like that and it worked very well.

00:15:24.308 --> 00:15:28.283
But there the relationships are so strong. Once Dhumal, you see,

00:15:28.783 --> 00:15:31.876
I think tied it to Raulbai.

00:15:32.194 --> 00:15:34.957
And now even if I say something to Raulbai, he doesn’t like.

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:38.845
It exceeded to that extent. It’s so sweet you know.

00:15:39.345 --> 00:15:43.756
And even Dhumal’s wife respects Raulbai as an elder sister, you see.

00:15:43.983 --> 00:15:47.928
It’s very sweet. Like that many relationships are established.

00:15:48.428 --> 00:15:50.096
And next year I think Raulbai

00:15:50.277 --> 00:15:54.531
became the sister of one of our trustees, who was no more there.

00:15:54.894 --> 00:15:57.269
And she always carried on all that

00:15:57.314 --> 00:16:00.510
relationship, and they also, I mean imagine.

00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:05.423
The whole thing is that, that relationship is so special,

00:16:05.923 --> 00:16:07.923
so close and so pure.

00:16:11.154 --> 00:16:13.154
And such a relationship one should develop

00:16:13.882 --> 00:16:16.588
with a lady, any woman

00:16:17.088 --> 00:16:20.277
or any friend you want to have.

00:16:21.915 --> 00:16:23.716
One should remember that it cannot

00:16:23.897 --> 00:16:26.394
cross a certain limit, there has to have a maryada.

00:16:26.439 --> 00:16:28.248
Otherwise they will become brothers and sisters

00:16:28.247 --> 00:16:29.881
and then they marry, it’s not possible.

00:16:31.701 --> 00:16:34.571
So we have to have the boundaries; that is very important.

00:16:35.071 --> 00:16:37.300
In Sahaja Yoga we have to have maryadas

00:16:37.299 --> 00:16:41.370
and boundaries. And one of them is this: that once you call somebody

00:16:41.401 --> 00:16:45.256
brother or a sister, is absolutely pure relationship.

00:16:46.529 --> 00:16:48.341
Little further we’ll go with that

00:16:48.613 --> 00:16:52.342
and that the relationship with a, as I have told you before,

00:16:52.842 --> 00:16:59.141
that with your, say, husband’s younger brothers

00:16:59.641 --> 00:17:02.235
is just like that they are like your younger brothers,

00:17:02.371 --> 00:17:04.651
all of them, husband’s younger brothers

00:17:05.151 --> 00:17:07.823
or younger Sahaja yogis than your husbands, are.

00:17:08.607 --> 00:17:10.607
The other way round is for all the ladies,

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:23.555
we can say, all the men, their wives, elder ladies, elder to your wives,

00:17:24.055 --> 00:17:26.915
are like sisters, elder sisters.

00:17:27.737 --> 00:17:30.529
I mean this relationship is so sweet and

00:17:31.029 --> 00:17:33.477
gives you a certain amount of understanding

00:17:33.571 --> 00:17:36.149
how much distance is kept with whom,

00:17:36.406 --> 00:17:38.728
with whom to be free and with whom to have the distance.

00:17:39.228 --> 00:17:41.960
And this must be maintained with such a beautiful way

00:17:42.095 --> 00:17:45.910
that this purity is not corrupted.

00:17:46.734 --> 00:17:51.070
You keep to pure standards. This is

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:54.622
the nourishment of Sahaja yoga, is the nourishment

00:17:54.879 --> 00:17:56.879
of your growth, purity.

00:17:57.095 --> 00:17:59.878
Purity is the most important thing for us,

00:18:00.378 --> 00:18:08.314
purity in every way. If you are pure, you will not do anything

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:17.180
that is, we can say, that is not pure.

00:18:19.181 --> 00:18:20.977
So first of all you’ll be pure yourself

00:18:21.477 --> 00:18:24.207
and you’ll accept purity, you’ll appreciate purity,

00:18:24.545 --> 00:18:28.240
you will be sustained by purity. Any impurity will not collaborate

00:18:28.862 --> 00:18:32.549
or try to compromise with you.

00:18:34.144 --> 00:18:38.461
That’s why purity is your Mother’s name.

00:18:39.326 --> 00:18:41.326
You know that My name is purity.

00:18:41.664 --> 00:18:45.798
And this purity is such that it pures everything,

00:18:46.298 --> 00:18:47.773
it just purifies.

00:18:47.949 --> 00:18:50.646
The purity should be such that it should purify,

00:18:52.444 --> 00:18:54.444
otherwise that purity has no meaning.

00:18:55.268 --> 00:18:59.915
For example, a soap purifies, all right. But you don’t purify the soap.

00:19:01.348 --> 00:19:04.883
Do you clean the soap? I mean some crazy people might be.

00:19:05.991 --> 00:19:07.991
I know some people, who even wash

00:19:08.491 --> 00:19:10.491
the tap and also the water.

00:19:13.465 --> 00:19:16.739
And that’s why, that’s why

00:19:16.792 --> 00:19:21.228
this water, which is the purifier, water is the purifier,

00:19:21.769 --> 00:19:23.769
water purifies us physically.

00:19:25.121 --> 00:19:29.401
And also our poisons are driven out of our liver

00:19:29.495 --> 00:19:32.689
also by water. Water is a very great element

00:19:32.743 --> 00:19:34.743
element in removing all problems.

00:19:34.959 --> 00:19:38.074
You use water for so many things; you know how it works it out.

00:19:38.371 --> 00:19:44.962
So this Lakshmi, which is purification, was born out of water.

00:19:45.462 --> 00:19:48.042
That’s why She was called as Mary as I told you.

00:19:48.866 --> 00:19:52.430
And I’m also called as Nira, meaning born out of water.

00:19:57.189 --> 00:20:00.503
So one has to understand that today’s message

00:20:00.638 --> 00:20:05.533
is that we inculcate purity.

00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:13.051
We should not cheat ourselves. It is easy to cheat, but we should inculcate

00:20:14.038 --> 00:20:16.615
purity within ourselves

00:20:17.331 --> 00:20:26.823
as a matter of our own maturity, as our own decoration, as our own beauty

00:20:27.323 --> 00:20:33.279
and not just because it’s a laborious thing

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:36.178
or it is a very hard thing, not like that.

00:20:38.446 --> 00:20:42.211
It should be achieved with great pleasure and happiness.

00:20:42.711 --> 00:20:44.711
How do we like to have a bath

00:20:45.039 --> 00:20:48.510
or to be clean and to be presentable?

00:20:48.751 --> 00:20:52.405
In the same way we should try to clean our thoughts.

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:56.008
Just by paying attention to them, we can clean them.

00:20:57.112 --> 00:21:00.877
Thoughts must be made clean. First of all why have thoughts at all.

00:21:02.671 --> 00:21:06.020
But even if you have, have clean and pure thoughts.

00:21:07.469 --> 00:21:12.558
Even if you have to have, don’t have thoughts full of arrogance,

00:21:13.058 --> 00:21:15.058
aggression or of fear.

00:21:15.386 --> 00:21:17.608
Some people think that if you have thoughts of fear

00:21:17.677 --> 00:21:19.677
it’s a very good thing; “Oh I'm frightened,

00:21:19.703 --> 00:21:23.665
I am afraid.” It’s impurity. Why should you be afraid?

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:27.890
That means your left Vishuddhi is catching.

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:31.939
There’s no need to have any fear of any kind;

00:21:32.439 --> 00:21:34.439
no need to have any fear of any kind.

00:21:35.025 --> 00:21:37.732
If you have to have fear

00:21:38.103 --> 00:21:39.762
that means there’s something wrong with you.

00:21:39.999 --> 00:21:43.290
If you believe that God is above all,

00:21:43.618 --> 00:21:46.213
you are a realized soul and that

00:21:46.713 --> 00:21:48.713
God is going to look after you,

00:21:49.213 --> 00:21:51.213
that He is your father,

00:21:51.454 --> 00:21:53.454
that He’s open His gates to you,

00:21:53.954 --> 00:21:55.472
what is there to be afraid of?

00:21:55.972 --> 00:21:58.820
Many people think that way that if you have the fears,

00:21:59.579 --> 00:22:02.824
you are humble. Humility is different

00:22:03.065 --> 00:22:05.065
from a frightened person.

00:22:05.436 --> 00:22:07.436
It’s absolutely a egible thing

00:22:07.548 --> 00:22:09.168
it has nothing to do with humility.

00:22:09.668 --> 00:22:12.590
So to be humble is different

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:18.198
and to be frightened is different. For Sahaja yogis

00:22:18.914 --> 00:22:23.389
it is very easy to find out through their vibratory awareness

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:28.277
what is fear and what is humility.

00:22:28.691 --> 00:22:33.385
As humility will give you vibrations and fear will catch all your left side.

00:22:39.189 --> 00:22:43.229
So our purification of our mind

00:22:43.427 --> 00:22:45.820
comes through certain methods

00:22:46.104 --> 00:22:48.104
of understanding ourselves.

00:22:48.604 --> 00:22:51.815
First of the understandings one has to have

00:23:01.907 --> 00:23:07.758
is that we are born

00:23:08.258 --> 00:23:11.508
in a family, born in a society, born in a so-called

00:23:12.008 --> 00:23:13.152
religious sect or whatever it is.

00:23:15.144 --> 00:23:22.215
So all these fixations have put into us certain amount of impurities.

00:23:23.212 --> 00:23:26.266
Which may give us ego, superego, anything it might give us.

00:23:27.619 --> 00:23:32.145
So to keep it pure and simple is:

00:23:34.137 --> 00:23:37.066
take to water element as much as you can.

00:23:38.277 --> 00:23:43.341
It helps both ways, it helps ego, it helps superego. Take to water element.

00:23:43.841 --> 00:23:51.387
And that is what Lakshmi is. Lakshmi is the one that gives you

00:23:51.887 --> 00:23:53.887
the Mahalakshmi Tattwa.

00:23:54.387 --> 00:23:58.357
From the Lakshmi only the Mahalakshmi’s principle comes in.

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:02.818
And this is after the purification through the Lakshmi process.

00:24:03.318 --> 00:24:05.318
Christ has said, “If you want

00:24:06.244 --> 00:24:08.244
I can give you gold, gold parts,

00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:10.966
you can live with it.

00:24:12.105 --> 00:24:16.456
But those who love Me will only enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:24:16.956 --> 00:24:18.956
And I will eat with them,”

00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:21.179
means those who are pure only I will eat with them.

00:24:21.471 --> 00:24:23.679
I will not eat with people, who are impure.

00:24:26.168 --> 00:24:31.308
He was so, I mean, every, all the incarnations are aware of it,

00:24:33.229 --> 00:24:35.068
that they have to be with the pure people

00:24:35.107 --> 00:24:38.678
and they have to help the pure people. But He so clearly said it

00:24:40.277 --> 00:24:42.277
that if you want Lakshmi,

00:24:42.423 --> 00:24:44.708
you can have it, that’s money.

00:24:46.661 --> 00:24:50.778
But that’s not Mahalakshmi, so from Lakshmi to Mahalakshmi state.

00:24:52.159 --> 00:24:53.142
You’ve already got

00:24:53.146 --> 00:24:55.714
your realization, you do not know how much you have got it already

00:24:56.214 --> 00:24:59.267
You are already having the Mahalakshmi principle within you.

00:24:59.565 --> 00:25:02.381
And what is the Mahalakshmi principle? That’s the point.

00:25:02.881 --> 00:25:04.299
Can I ask this question?

00:25:13.675 --> 00:25:15.675
What is the Mahalakshmi principle within you?

00:25:20.464 --> 00:25:22.688
It’s all for the Spirit.

00:25:23.578 --> 00:25:25.157
It’s all for the Spirit.

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:28.330
No, no. But you have a power.

00:25:30.779 --> 00:25:33.315
You have got MahaLakshmi’s powers within you, do you know that?

00:25:36.273 --> 00:25:37.428
The pleasure it gives you.

00:25:37.511 --> 00:25:37.845
hmm?

00:25:37.928 --> 00:25:39.465
The pleasure it gives you.

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:40.038
Beg your pardon?

00:25:40.195 --> 00:25:41.623
The pleasure it gives you.

00:25:41.664 --> 00:25:42.302
The pleasure?

00:25:42.345 --> 00:25:42.843
Yes.

00:25:42.886 --> 00:25:43.822
No, no, no.

00:25:43.922 --> 00:25:45.922
The power of giving realization.

00:25:47.108 --> 00:25:49.579
Go ahead still, little more, more.

00:25:49.654 --> 00:25:53.072
Pleasure is not a power.

00:25:53.972 --> 00:25:58.391
Pleasure is what you enjoy. But you have a power of Mahalakshmi.

00:25:58.891 --> 00:26:00.891
Sustaining power.

00:26:01.734 --> 00:26:04.428
Sustaining power.

00:26:05.786 --> 00:26:12.542
That’s no power. Power means, you have that power to do something.

00:26:16.701 --> 00:26:19.593
The power to spread Sahaja yoga.

00:26:19.693 --> 00:26:21.693
The power to spread Sahaja yoga Mother.

00:26:22.193 --> 00:26:25.457
That’s rather vague, particular one.

00:26:25.614 --> 00:26:27.614
Power to give realization.

00:26:32.059 --> 00:26:32.711
To evolve Mother.

00:26:35.944 --> 00:26:37.326
To evolve.

00:26:37.826 --> 00:26:39.826
But to evolve is your own.

00:26:40.326 --> 00:26:42.326
Power is what you do to others.

00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:50.046
The whole thing I told you just now. Is to purify.

00:26:52.338 --> 00:26:58.928
You have the power to purify. How do you cure people?

00:26:59.926 --> 00:27:06.061
By purifying them. All right?

00:27:08.851 --> 00:27:13.255
Now just think how you purify others, by talking to others

00:27:13.755 --> 00:27:15.755
you can purify them.

00:27:18.844 --> 00:27:24.302
By touching others, you can purify them. By looking at them,

00:27:24.802 --> 00:27:26.175
you can purify them.

00:27:27.272 --> 00:27:29.657
One person who is a realized soul,

00:27:29.659 --> 00:27:33.479
purifies the whole atmosphere. The atmosphere is purified.

00:27:33.979 --> 00:27:35.979
Since I’ve come, it has been warm enough.

00:27:40.163 --> 00:27:45.257
You purify everything. You purify this light, do you notice that?

00:27:46.852 --> 00:27:48.852
You’ve awakened the light.

00:27:53.932 --> 00:27:55.932
Now what other powers you have?

00:28:04.857 --> 00:28:05.600
To raise the Kundalini.

00:28:07.195 --> 00:28:09.195
That’s awakening.

00:28:09.396 --> 00:28:11.396
See Kundalini is many powers, is many-folded.

00:28:14.659 --> 00:28:16.543
You purify yourselves,

00:28:17.839 --> 00:28:19.839
others and yourselves.

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:23.508
Some more powers are there. Now come along, let’s have it.

00:28:25.451 --> 00:28:27.678
You all have those powers and you are not aware of them

00:28:27.658 --> 00:28:29.397
this is the best part of it.

00:28:32.125 --> 00:28:34.834
You can’t follow it. Now let’s have it.

00:28:35.148 --> 00:28:37.148
Power over time. Arranging time to suit yourselves Mother.

00:28:40.024 --> 00:28:42.024
Power over time.

00:28:42.524 --> 00:28:44.524
Arranging time to suit yourselves.

00:28:45.173 --> 00:28:47.173
That’s not a power of Mahalakshmi.

00:28:48.341 --> 00:28:50.819
That’s another one I’ll tell you who does that.

00:28:56.369 --> 00:28:58.627
Balance.

00:29:04.599 --> 00:29:07.932
It gives balance between ego and superego?

00:29:07.949 --> 00:29:11.407
That’s true. That is one of them. But that is guru power.

00:29:11.424 --> 00:29:13.154
That is the guru’s power.

00:29:13.654 --> 00:29:14.865
Balance comes from guru.

00:29:18.196 --> 00:29:20.620
See Mahalakshmi is water, so now you tell Me.

00:29:23.162 --> 00:29:23.785
To cleanse.

00:29:24.285 --> 00:29:27.936
That’s done now, the cleansing is done. Water else water does?

00:29:32.558 --> 00:29:34.558
Satisfied.

00:29:35.058 --> 00:29:37.058
Now coming to the part.

00:29:38.709 --> 00:29:41.625
It quenches the thirst, the spiritual thirst.

00:29:42.979 --> 00:29:46.410
You can quench the spiritual thirst of people, tremendous power,

00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:48.910
because when you give realization

00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:51.788
that the seeking is over.

00:29:52.511 --> 00:29:58.058
All right? Then another one now come along. What other powers?

00:30:02.048 --> 00:30:03.206
Think of the water,

00:30:07.753 --> 00:30:11.713
nourishment, you nourish.

00:30:13.327 --> 00:30:17.048
You give spiritual nourishment to people through your power;

00:30:17.399 --> 00:30:19.922
even if you are standing there you are nourishing others.

00:30:24.172 --> 00:30:26.172
Then dissolvement,

00:30:27.786 --> 00:30:30.462
you dissolve their ego and you dissolve their super ego.

00:30:31.705 --> 00:30:34.195
All these powers you own after realization.

00:30:38.074 --> 00:30:41.605
Just think of it. What else?

00:30:45.045 --> 00:30:45.930
Divinity.

00:30:46.059 --> 00:30:48.059
That’s very vague

00:30:48.188 --> 00:30:50.188
because divinity

00:30:50.354 --> 00:30:54.436
is how to relate it to water. People won’t understand it, so let us put it

00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:57.170
other way round. What is it?

00:30:57.633 --> 00:30:59.633
Cool down emotions.

00:31:00.615 --> 00:31:03.111
To coll down emotions.

00:31:03.388 --> 00:31:05.165
You become a cool down person

00:31:06.667 --> 00:31:08.038
very good,

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:17.041
very good. You become cool,

00:31:18.432 --> 00:31:23.808
cool personality. You have cooling effect, very good, water else.

00:31:24.011 --> 00:31:27.100
You carry others. You can carry others.

00:31:28.269 --> 00:31:30.269
You can, very gently

00:31:31.326 --> 00:31:32.952
and also drown some of them.

00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:39.485
Drown into the love,

00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:42.655
into the ocean of love.

00:31:43.155 --> 00:31:45.941
But you can also push them

00:31:46.441 --> 00:31:50.764
with two running jumps, all right. That also can be done.

00:31:53.715 --> 00:31:57.951
It has another very great quality that water permeates

00:31:58.674 --> 00:32:03.089
into the smallest particle. It goes the roots, I mean suck into the roots.

00:32:05.334 --> 00:32:08.786
So Mahalakshmi power you just see the roots of the person. You just

00:32:08.803 --> 00:32:10.381
know where the problem comes from,

00:32:10.881 --> 00:32:11.944
you jump at it

00:32:12.444 --> 00:32:16.012
actually it is the awareness, it is the intelligence,

00:32:16.512 --> 00:32:21.246
suck the truth part of it which gets enlightened.

00:32:21.746 --> 00:32:26.414
And you understand that now where is the problem, you just go near the root

00:32:26.914 --> 00:32:31.712
and you suck and you can be easily sucked, you permeate.

00:32:33.586 --> 00:32:35.586
You see, when you are sitting near a person

00:32:36.903 --> 00:32:39.095
then you tell Me, “Mother, this is catching at the back,

00:32:39.261 --> 00:32:40.300
the person doesn’t know.”

00:32:41.691 --> 00:32:43.691
You have permeated. Your personality has

00:32:43.708 --> 00:32:45.708
permeated into that person. He doesn’t know.

00:32:45.762 --> 00:32:48.921
You have permeated into that person and you are feeling the roots,

00:32:49.421 --> 00:32:51.421
where is the problem.

00:32:51.921 --> 00:32:53.921
The water is flowing into that being.

00:32:54.495 --> 00:32:56.983
The divine water is flowing into that being

00:32:57.297 --> 00:33:01.873
and the obstruction is felt through that divine water

00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:05.689
and you can say that this is catching that is catching.

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:09.080
So permeate, permeating

00:33:09.209 --> 00:33:11.925
and the another one is the glistening

00:33:12.833 --> 00:33:19.509
of the water is so your glistening your skin becomes very radiant.

00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:25.534
And the last of all is the reflection.

00:33:26.814 --> 00:33:28.814
A person, who sees you,

00:33:30.279 --> 00:33:33.653
sees his own reflection. He gets frightened.

00:33:35.118 --> 00:33:37.118
With Me, it this happens sometimes.

00:33:37.618 --> 00:33:38.687
I don’t mean anything

00:33:38.779 --> 00:33:42.346
bad to anyone but people are unnecessarily frightened of Me

00:33:43.551 --> 00:33:44.878
because they see their reflection.

00:33:46.492 --> 00:33:49.506
So when they reach you they see their reflection can be very aggressive

00:33:49.857 --> 00:33:53.446
because they see their reflection. They can be very hard on you

00:33:53.946 --> 00:33:55.946
because they see their reflection

00:34:01.069 --> 00:34:07.468
and if it is clear-cut water, then you see the depth of that person.

00:34:09.416 --> 00:34:11.416
If you are clear-cut Sahaja yogi

00:34:11.916 --> 00:34:19.457
you feel the depth clearly and they can see through - the spirit shines.

00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:24.630
These are the qualities of water

00:34:26.123 --> 00:34:27.390
within us.

00:34:29.716 --> 00:34:33.948
The more of that I would say specially in My body

00:34:35.153 --> 00:34:37.153
the water I actually buffer

00:34:37.653 --> 00:34:39.653
to protect the charkas.

00:34:39.737 --> 00:34:41.737
If I don’t have water in the body

00:34:42.045 --> 00:34:45.655
I may have problems. So it acts as buffer

00:34:46.828 --> 00:34:48.828
also it soothes your

00:34:50.377 --> 00:34:54.317
epidermal cells; you can say it soothes your blindness.

00:34:54.727 --> 00:34:58.807
You see, if there is no moisture /?/ blindness/dryness in all that.

00:35:00.386 --> 00:35:02.386
It soothes everyone

00:35:05.553 --> 00:35:11.074
and there are other types of powers of water, which we know of

00:35:11.574 --> 00:35:13.574
when it comes out of your eyes

00:35:15.992 --> 00:35:17.992
it expresses your compassion,

00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:22.230
your love, your emotions.

00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:24.970
That is the only thing

00:35:26.579 --> 00:35:30.076
out of all the elements which expresses emotions,

00:35:33.453 --> 00:35:36.066
water power /?/.

00:35:38.093 --> 00:35:42.790
Water has other qualities also which physics people know hydrostatics

00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:45.740
it has the pressure.

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:47.790
It has the pressure

00:35:48.110 --> 00:35:50.110
and a person who exists

00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:51.921
like a Sahaja yogi

00:35:52.421 --> 00:35:56.473
will definitely put a pressure on others. He will not, he will not

00:35:56.973 --> 00:35:59.857
aggress but there will be a pressure and pressure.

00:36:00.357 --> 00:36:04.352
And another person if he receives one then he

00:36:05.122 --> 00:36:07.931
will gets the advantage of you, but if he doesn’t want to receive it

00:36:08.431 --> 00:36:12.850
then he feel pressurize and feels little bit dominated.

00:36:14.249 --> 00:36:16.249
Your neibhours, your family people

00:36:16.749 --> 00:36:19.025
at the beginning they feel a pressure because

00:36:19.225 --> 00:36:22.758
the body achieves a kind of a weight

00:36:24.696 --> 00:36:27.940
and that’s how the Guru Tattwa is formed out of you.

00:36:30.088 --> 00:36:32.088
And if there is salt

00:36:33.217 --> 00:36:36.420
that's Guru Principle then the weight is even more.

00:36:39.168 --> 00:36:43.413
So today for water should really

00:36:43.913 --> 00:36:48.179
know that the water is a very holy thing

00:36:48.679 --> 00:36:51.503
and in our pujas also we use

00:36:51.793 --> 00:36:54.030
specially this thing dignifies

00:36:54.380 --> 00:37:01.194
the Kundalini that means the Kundalini is the water jar

00:37:01.334 --> 00:37:07.887
or the carrier of Aquarius. And this is the age of the Aquarius. So how

00:37:08.177 --> 00:37:13.397
important is this water and the water is the carrier

00:37:14.347 --> 00:37:20.921
of divine love, is the best carrier. And this is the time

00:37:21.151 --> 00:37:25.749
of Aquarius means the Kundalini is made of divine water.

00:37:30.115 --> 00:37:34.274
So the whole idea of celebrating

00:37:35.313 --> 00:37:41.692
today the Lakshmi’s day is to understand that in us

00:37:42.192 --> 00:37:46.660
She has become the Mahalakshmi. By that we have so many powers

00:37:46.699 --> 00:37:49.183
of which we are not aware, I mean we do not

00:37:49.279 --> 00:37:51.982
know also that we are realized souls. Some of us, we do not know

00:37:52.482 --> 00:37:55.562
and that we have those powers within us that we can permeate into others.

00:37:56.062 --> 00:37:58.472
We can project our personalities to others.

00:37:58.684 --> 00:38:00.684
We can find out what’s wrong with them.

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:05.724
We can find out about ourselves. We can go into ourselves, we can go into -

00:38:05.936 --> 00:38:12.072
our permeation is like water is moving, is flowing all the time. And this

00:38:12.976 --> 00:38:16.489
is a very important thing that we should be aware

00:38:16.528 --> 00:38:18.054
of: our powers that we have achieved.

00:38:18.381 --> 00:38:22.055
Then we will start respecting ourselves then the Rajalakshmi comes in

00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:24.136
and then the Gruhalakshmi comes in

00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:27.447
and everything comes with in when we become aware

00:38:27.601 --> 00:38:32.412
of what we have achieved of our self-esteem,

00:38:35.103 --> 00:38:37.103
of our dignity.

00:38:37.603 --> 00:38:41.477
So it gives us dignity, Mahalakshmi gives us dignity.

00:38:42.496 --> 00:38:46.083
And that’s how we start understanding the value of human dignity.

00:38:46.987 --> 00:38:50.730
We should have also the idea of human dignity

00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:53.992
that we cannot insult human dignity,

00:38:58.356 --> 00:39:01.814
like people who are nagging others all the time. It’s against

00:39:03.179 --> 00:39:05.392
or all the time asserting themselves about

00:39:05.373 --> 00:39:08.020
something making everybody’s life miserable.

00:39:08.232 --> 00:39:12.228
It’s against human dignity. You have to decorate another's life,

00:39:12.382 --> 00:39:17.489
you have to make it beautiful, you have to make it enjoyable

00:39:17.701 --> 00:39:21.546
and happy, make everyone happy, not to nag all the time.

00:39:22.046 --> 00:39:24.221
And if you nag that’s not a Gruhalakshmi;

00:39:24.433 --> 00:39:27.236
that is not a Gruhalakshmi. You should not nag, “Do this, do that,

00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:30.341
stand up, what are you doing, stand this side, do, go that side.”

00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:33.004
It’s all a nonsense. You /?/ the person to do it;

00:39:33.389 --> 00:39:35.227
the human dignity is the most important thing.

00:39:35.727 --> 00:39:37.727
Must respect the human dignity.

00:39:38.227 --> 00:39:41.125
And that’s possible because now you have got the Mahalakshmi power.

00:39:41.625 --> 00:39:44.748
Those who do not have the dignity also will get it from you

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:46.544
because you are dignified now.

00:39:47.678 --> 00:39:50.268
If you have sense of dignity, you will never insult other’s dignity.

00:39:50.768 --> 00:39:52.768
For small, small things we insult others

00:39:52.807 --> 00:39:56.222
“Why did you put the soap here, why did you do this, why did you do that?”

00:39:57.645 --> 00:39:59.392
And the another side coud be that others

00:39:59.546 --> 00:40:02.907
have no dignity so they go on doing things just like animals.

00:40:03.407 --> 00:40:05.407
The both things are wrong.

00:40:06.253 --> 00:40:11.494
But one must respect and respect brings the best results I have seen.

00:40:11.994 --> 00:40:15.442
That’s the best result, once you respect and love

00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:19.730
and then the trust is grown

00:40:19.769 --> 00:40:21.411
and one should keep the trust.

00:40:21.565 --> 00:40:24.553
And that’s how the human dignity /?/

00:40:25.053 --> 00:40:27.053
We must respect every Sahaja yogi

00:40:27.899 --> 00:40:31.614
because we are all saints, to respect each other,

00:40:32.114 --> 00:40:34.114
absolutely respect because you are all saints.

00:40:34.268 --> 00:40:36.268
I don’t know you realize what I am saying.

00:40:37.691 --> 00:40:41.955
Each one of you is capable of giving realization to the whole world,

00:40:42.455 --> 00:40:43.541
each one of you

00:40:46.521 --> 00:40:50.617
and if we realize then we must respect ourselves and respect others.

00:40:51.117 --> 00:40:53.829
You should do not talk frivolously about others, make fun.

00:40:55.309 --> 00:40:57.309
And specially your Mother,

00:40:57.636 --> 00:40:59.636
you can’t take liberties with Her.

00:41:00.886 --> 00:41:02.886
That is something one has to know

00:41:03.386 --> 00:41:07.544
in the west is important. This is very important

00:41:08.217 --> 00:41:10.217
that one has to know about it.

00:41:11.467 --> 00:41:13.467
The other day I was correcting somebody.

00:41:13.967 --> 00:41:15.967
So Hugh said that “You are a very lucky person

00:41:16.063 --> 00:41:17.926
that Mother is correcting you; you are very lucky

00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:20.080
that She is correcting you, telling you something,

00:41:20.349 --> 00:41:24.807
because you are naive you see, that is why you start taking liberties.”

00:41:25.538 --> 00:41:29.158
First of all you must respect the divinity of your Mother.

00:41:29.427 --> 00:41:33.839
That’s very important. And that gives you the greatest dignity.

00:41:35.031 --> 00:41:40.189
I am telling you this because unless and until you do that, your growth

00:41:40.689 --> 00:41:42.689
cannot come up well.

00:41:42.728 --> 00:41:44.728
So that is a very important point

00:41:45.228 --> 00:41:49.556
and like in India supposing somebody is going to a temple

00:41:49.652 --> 00:41:52.423
or they come to - for example, today

00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:55.235
She has come or somebody has come they will better,

00:41:55.331 --> 00:41:56.689
they will wear a nice dress.

00:41:57.477 --> 00:42:00.324
You see, you are going to a temple and all the ornaments they will wear,

00:42:00.478 --> 00:42:01.895
everything they will wear.

00:42:02.049 --> 00:42:04.402
That is the day they have to present all their dignity.

00:42:04.902 --> 00:42:07.076
So one should not come with

00:42:07.288 --> 00:42:10.312
dishevel hair or things like that.

00:42:12.254 --> 00:42:15.968
That is not a good thing because all these things are important,

00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:18.180
how you respect.

00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:23.165
How you have to be dressed

00:42:23.434 --> 00:42:25.662
how you have to presentable, because these things

00:42:25.758 --> 00:42:28.001
Some people say that oh /?/

00:42:28.501 --> 00:42:30.501
we don’t need to be tidy because we are the spirit

00:42:31.001 --> 00:42:33.001
Spirit is the most tidy thing.

00:42:33.213 --> 00:42:35.574
It tidies everything you see.

00:42:35.671 --> 00:42:38.729
It tidies everything. It goes into proper synthesis, proper

00:42:38.998 --> 00:42:40.644
concord, a complete,

00:42:41.375 --> 00:42:43.558
beautiful music is created out of that.

00:42:44.058 --> 00:42:47.558
How can a chaotic person be called spiritual man? Cannot,

00:42:47.597 --> 00:42:50.492
anybody who is chaotic, their house is chaotic, their things are chaotic,

00:42:50.588 --> 00:42:52.891
you must know there is something bhootish in them,

00:42:52.915 --> 00:42:54.915
absolutely.

00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:58.280
But you should not be other way round, that

00:42:58.492 --> 00:43:01.019
so meticulous that you eat others’ heads.

00:43:01.532 --> 00:43:04.700
That’s another side. So both things should not be done.

00:43:05.025 --> 00:43:08.205
And I go on insisting on this point because it is very important

00:43:08.705 --> 00:43:10.222
for ego-oriented people

00:43:10.722 --> 00:43:12.722
because they can become anything.

00:43:13.395 --> 00:43:16.446
The other day I was going on King’s Road and I was surprised

00:43:17.004 --> 00:43:19.004
what sort of dresses people are wearing

00:43:19.043 --> 00:43:21.163
and they think that “whatever we wear, we are.”

00:43:21.259 --> 00:43:22.955
That means you must be monkeys,

00:43:23.455 --> 00:43:25.455
you wear such dresses and go about it.

00:43:25.955 --> 00:43:28.423
If you believe in that then you should be decent people,

00:43:28.635 --> 00:43:29.985
there should be decorum about it.

00:43:35.617 --> 00:43:42.297
So today we have learnt about Lakshmi's growth into Mahalakshmi

00:43:42.912 --> 00:43:46.393
but it is not that when you grow into something the rest of it is finished,

00:43:46.489 --> 00:43:50.279
is not so, that some people think that they become

00:43:50.316 --> 00:43:54.023
spiritual personality now Lakshmi Tattwa is not there, is not true.

00:43:54.869 --> 00:43:56.869
You have to be decent person,

00:43:57.369 --> 00:44:02.026
properly dressed according to your status in life, the way you live.

00:44:02.526 --> 00:44:06.877
And there should be no, what you call, hypocrisy about it,

00:44:07.377 --> 00:44:10.526
no hypocrisy. By doing any

00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:12.680
nonsensical thing,

00:44:12.719 --> 00:44:15.547
like some people think becoming a primitive or anything,

00:44:15.759 --> 00:44:17.935
you will impress others. You will never impress,

00:44:18.147 --> 00:44:20.147
you see. It’s beggar’s thing,

00:44:20.416 --> 00:44:24.176
see, doing beggary you will get some beggars bhoot into you.

00:44:25.253 --> 00:44:28.071
So we are not to be beggars, neither we have to be

00:44:28.571 --> 00:44:32.115
a sort of dandies, but we are Sahaja yogis, dignified people.

00:44:32.615 --> 00:44:36.353
We have our own self-esteem and we live with our own dignity,

00:44:36.622 --> 00:44:40.865
and that’s how we should be pure

00:44:41.884 --> 00:44:43.884
transparent, honest,

00:44:44.961 --> 00:44:46.576
within ourselves we should be honest,

00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:49.769
absolutely honest. Water is so honest with itself.

00:44:50.557 --> 00:44:52.557
We put anything to the water it will show.

00:44:53.807 --> 00:44:55.807
Put any color into it, it will show.

00:44:56.307 --> 00:44:58.307
Put any mud it will show.

00:44:58.403 --> 00:45:01.113
You have to be so honest, honest to yourself.

00:45:02.132 --> 00:45:05.213
And the whole thing should work out to be a personality

00:45:05.713 --> 00:45:10.467
and be congenial, beautiful, permeating, no doubt

00:45:10.794 --> 00:45:12.674
but very beautifully enlightened

00:45:13.174 --> 00:45:15.174
because Mahalakshmi Tattwa itself

00:45:15.213 --> 00:45:17.213
is enlightenment in our awareness.

00:45:17.713 --> 00:45:20.178
Such a person cannot be an idiot. If there is an idiot

00:45:20.274 --> 00:45:22.274
he is not a Sahaja yogi, definitely he is not.

00:45:23.178 --> 00:45:26.217
Idiotic person cannot be a Sahaja yogi - nitwits,

00:45:28.389 --> 00:45:31.860
absent-minded, all that has to go away.

00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:34.360
If you all have to be sahaja yogis, you cannot be,

00:45:34.687 --> 00:45:37.800
“Oh, I know, I know, I know.” All that nonsense is not be there,

00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:39.183
should not be there.

00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:48.306
The lakshanas or what do you call, the seed tops, or you can say,

00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:53.140
what do you call lakshanas,

00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:57.271
is the way you can make out a Sahaja yogi, should be

00:45:57.771 --> 00:46:02.483
a Lakshmi putra is the sign of Lakshmi like a king /?/

00:46:03.502 --> 00:46:06.302
That doesn’t mean that he has everything to him self, no.

00:46:07.033 --> 00:46:09.033
That doesn’t mean that, king gives.

00:46:09.245 --> 00:46:11.439
He gives with generosity, known by his generosity.

00:46:11.708 --> 00:46:14.551
He is not known by how much he grabs, does he?

00:46:15.051 --> 00:46:18.285
He is a king, as it is, is giving.

00:46:21.209 --> 00:46:23.439
Then he should be cool personality.

00:46:25.323 --> 00:46:28.211
He should not be frozen. He should be cool personality,

00:46:29.345 --> 00:46:32.197
not hot- tempered. Those who are hot-tempered,

00:46:32.697 --> 00:46:35.430
I have seen people, you see, here

00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:38.276
they first take to violence. I mean violence is

00:46:38.315 --> 00:46:40.491
something out of question for Sahaja yogis,

00:46:41.737 --> 00:46:45.706
no question. If somebody beat you also you are not to beat him back.

00:46:46.437 --> 00:46:48.437
We have ways to beat them

00:46:49.802 --> 00:46:51.802
but you are not to beat them back.

00:46:52.821 --> 00:46:54.821
You are not to resist them,

00:46:55.033 --> 00:46:58.985
but if you are a sahaja yogi you have no business to be violent to anyone,

00:46:59.485 --> 00:47:01.968
even with your tongue. Some people are

00:47:02.064 --> 00:47:04.064
more with the tongue provocating type.

00:47:04.564 --> 00:47:07.476
You must know that you must correct all these points.

00:47:07.976 --> 00:47:11.958
It is important because tomorrow if you are going to show to the world

00:47:12.458 --> 00:47:14.458
what Sahaja Yoga is not /?/

00:47:19.745 --> 00:47:21.745
So we have to dedicate ourselves

00:47:21.957 --> 00:47:23.490
to our purification,

00:47:23.875 --> 00:47:26.522
to our glorification because water glorifies,

00:47:27.022 --> 00:47:29.022
gives you glory.

00:47:29.118 --> 00:47:32.441
You are all looking so nice and glistening on the face and I can see

00:47:32.479 --> 00:47:34.361
the Ganti Rupena Samasthita.

00:47:34.515 --> 00:47:38.856
He said that “Ya Devi Sarva Butheshu Ganti Rupena,” the glistening,

00:47:38.895 --> 00:47:43.609
the light and that’s there I can see you in you all.

00:47:43.821 --> 00:47:49.188
It has already come but it should be inside also.

00:47:50.553 --> 00:47:53.596
And that person who is a realized soul

00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:56.151
one doesn’t have to vow for it.

00:47:56.939 --> 00:47:58.939
people just know that he is realized soul.

00:47:59.958 --> 00:48:03.940
You don’t have to tell anyone people just know the way he is.

00:48:06.574 --> 00:48:08.574
So many points we have covered today.

00:48:08.901 --> 00:48:10.901
I hope you will

00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:12.414
again listen to them because,

00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:15.904
see, Mataji’s lecture goes from one ear and comes out from the other.

00:48:16.807 --> 00:48:20.657
Thank God we have a way of localizing it.

00:48:20.926 --> 00:48:22.926
I hope you people will take these tapes

00:48:23.022 --> 00:48:26.288
and listen to them everyday one by one

00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:29.576
and also act, not planning

00:48:29.788 --> 00:48:33.782
in the paper or in the ear. But it should go in the heart.

00:48:36.185 --> 00:48:38.185
That’s how we are all going to mature

00:48:38.397 --> 00:48:41.713
beautiful children. I’m just counting

00:48:42.213 --> 00:48:48.066
now again C.P. will be elected for four years and then I have to

00:48:48.566 --> 00:48:53.911
there is hardly three years it will pass away and

00:48:54.988 --> 00:48:57.289
I won’t be able to go so much in U.K.

00:48:57.789 --> 00:49:00.426
The responsibility, such a lot on you people.

00:49:02.887 --> 00:49:05.554
I hope we celebrate some more Diwalis together.

00:49:06.382 --> 00:49:08.382
May God bless you!
