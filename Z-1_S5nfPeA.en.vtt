WEBVTT

00:11:26.702 --> 00:11:40.462
Today, we have decided to have a Vishnumaya
Puja. In this context, one has to know who

00:11:40.462 --> 00:11:52.591
is this Vishnumaya and what is Her – you
can call it mythological [Shri Mataji laughs

00:11:52.591 --> 00:11:59.871
gently] – but a historical relationship.
I have told you that America is the country

00:11:59.871 --> 00:12:08.341
of Shri Krishna and He’s Kubera, as well
as He’s Yama. Because He’s Kubera, people

00:12:08.341 --> 00:12:14.991
have got their affluence, they are rich people,
they have money, more than anywhere else,

00:12:14.991 --> 00:12:29.421
but if you do not remember, that you have
to have balance, and that Shri Krishna’s

00:12:29.421 --> 00:12:46.111
power is of Mahalakshmi. So Mahalakshmi Principle
is such that where seeking is important, Vishnu

00:12:46.111 --> 00:12:55.912
Principle is there when Shri Lakshmi is His
power. After getting the Lakshmi up to a certain

00:12:55.912 --> 00:13:05.322
point, then you jump into a new awareness
or a new sort of a seeking which is the seeking

00:13:05.322 --> 00:13:12.152
of the spirit where the Mahalakshmi principle
starts, the central path.

00:13:12.152 --> 00:13:19.091
That far, of course, in America it started,
the Mahalakshmi Principle, but people did

00:13:19.091 --> 00:13:31.141
not know, they had no discretion to know which
way to go for their seeking and so many got

00:13:31.141 --> 00:13:38.361
enamoured by false advertisements, by all
kinds of promises, claims and things and I

00:13:38.361 --> 00:13:46.221
came here long time back at that moment where
I knew that the seeking now is showing results

00:13:46.221 --> 00:13:53.731
and that all the people from all over the
world will try to come down here because there

00:13:53.731 --> 00:14:04.231
was a market for them and their marketing
will start in such a manner that these people

00:14:04.231 --> 00:14:35.061
who are used to marketing will fall into it.
I came here, I think I was the first to arrive,

00:14:35.061 --> 00:14:41.251
I warned them, I told them names of the people
who will be doing all this kind of work. Also

00:14:41.251 --> 00:14:46.482
I told them what were they in their last lives,
what kind of a thing they did, what kind of

00:14:46.482 --> 00:14:52.482
work they did, what are their negatives powers
and how they tried to manipulate. But nobody

00:14:52.482 --> 00:15:00.611
would listen to me. Because these people found
out that the weaknesses of Americans, if you

00:15:00.611 --> 00:15:10.021
can pamper them, pamper their ego, and tell
them that this is something very important,

00:15:10.021 --> 00:15:24.012
that you should do something – ah- that
is very superficial but something looks fantastic

00:15:24.012 --> 00:15:30.252
as I told you that they said : you can fly
three feet height. And the Americans took

00:15:30.252 --> 00:15:36.972
to it. All such absurd ideas, they took to
it because they thought it was something new,

00:15:36.972 --> 00:15:44.611
something different and they wouldn’t listen
to Me because I said I won’t take money.

00:15:44.611 --> 00:15:50.322
And they told Me very clearly that “Nobody
will understand you if you don’t take money.”

00:15:50.322 --> 00:15:55.542
So I said how much will you pay Me which is
so invaluable? How much money are you going

00:15:55.542 --> 00:16:02.122
to pay Me?” And they had no answer.
So those people who were still money-oriented,

00:16:02.122 --> 00:16:07.812
so the Mahalakshmi Principle was not in them
to understand that if you have to seek the

00:16:07.812 --> 00:16:13.581
truth, you cannot pay for it. They couldn’t
understand that and that is how they had to

00:16:13.581 --> 00:16:21.592
go through all this circle of facing all kinds
of false gurus, all types, all superficial

00:16:21.592 --> 00:16:27.671
things.
Ultimately now, I think, first year I feel

00:16:27.671 --> 00:16:40.822
everything has come up very well, but one
of the chakras of this Vishuddhi is, as you

00:16:40.822 --> 00:16:48.282
know, very important, is the Left Vishuddhi.
And the Left Vishuddhi is the centre, if it

00:16:48.282 --> 00:16:56.452
is caught up, you get angina, you get spondylitis
and also you get lethargic organs. So this

00:16:56.452 --> 00:17:06.322
Left Vishuddhi has been a sort of a fashion
with the Western people, maybe because of

00:17:06.322 --> 00:17:12.241
Christianity where you had to confess and
you have to say you’re a sinner and you’re

00:17:12.241 --> 00:17:14.602
a born sinner, an original sinner all kinds
of things.

00:17:14.602 --> 00:17:21.162
So, as you are branded as sinner, you see,
you always felt guilty and that guilt was

00:17:21.162 --> 00:17:29.741
built in, in the Left Vishuddhi. I think this
is one of the greatest drawbacks, even today,

00:17:29.741 --> 00:17:39.051
that people in America feel extremely guilty
for very small things, because they have no

00:17:39.051 --> 00:17:45.081
confidence in themselves. Firstly, they think
that “We are a very young nation. We had

00:17:45.081 --> 00:17:52.732
no tradition – basically”. They may look
arrogant, they may look to be very show-offs,

00:17:52.732 --> 00:17:59.431
but basically inside, they feel that “We
have had no tradition. We are a very young

00:17:59.431 --> 00:18:08.051
nation.” Like they think that the English
are too over sophisticated or the French are

00:18:08.051 --> 00:18:13.502
very sophisticated and we are not, compared
to them. We are primitive.” This kind of

00:18:13.502 --> 00:18:22.792
funny ideas they have. And because of this,
you see, they try to make up. To make it up,

00:18:22.792 --> 00:18:31.812
the path they followed ended up into all kinds
of things and it built up a very huge Left

00:18:31.812 --> 00:18:43.192
Vishuddhi in them. That’s why Americans
are having so many problems of the Left Vishuddhi.

00:18:43.192 --> 00:18:51.322
First of all, this centre catches when you
do not want to face your mistakes. “I’ve

00:18:51.322 --> 00:18:55.292
committed this mistake all right, I’ve committed
it, now I’m not going to do it, and why

00:18:55.292 --> 00:19:00.942
I commit it and why it happened, just face
it.” They don’t want to. They will feel

00:19:00.942 --> 00:19:04.162
guilty that we have done this or I’ll put
it here. [Shri Mataji puts Her hand on Her

00:19:04.162 --> 00:19:10.422
left shoulder, close to the neck] Like, they
go on amassing, like very black clouds of

00:19:10.422 --> 00:19:20.422
guilt.
Then this Vishnumaya, who is the thunder,

00:19:20.422 --> 00:19:32.042
we can call, who is the electrical charge,
which is liberated by the friction of these

00:19:32.042 --> 00:19:43.922
black clouds, which actually is a catalyst
for rain. It’s a catalyst for rain. This

00:19:43.922 --> 00:19:59.022
starts acting on such people, that is, they
suddenly get a shock. They become extremely

00:19:59.022 --> 00:20:11.092
sensitive people. They get nervous and this
nervousness can make, makes them think “Why

00:20:11.092 --> 00:20:17.362
are we nervous? What is the problem?” Like
the exposure of their guilt comes through

00:20:17.362 --> 00:20:21.772
the Vishnumaya Power.
Now I have to tell you about also the origin

00:20:21.772 --> 00:20:27.282
of Vishnumaya, which is very interesting.
Vishnumaya was the sister of Shri Krishna,

00:20:27.282 --> 00:20:35.302
who was born after Shri Krishna was born.
Actually She was not His own sister, but She

00:20:35.302 --> 00:20:45.382
was a daughter of Nanda. And when Shri Krishna
was taken over and was put in the care of

00:20:45.382 --> 00:20:53.612
Nand and Yeshoda they gave their own daughter
in His place and the father of Shri Krishna

00:20:53.612 --> 00:21:02.132
brought it back [in the castle]. So when Kamsa
came – the uncle- you all know about the

00:21:02.132 --> 00:21:09.132
story – to ask about the eighth child, they
said, “This is the child.” He said, “But

00:21:09.132 --> 00:21:16.332
this’s not a man. This is a woman.” He
took the child in his hand and did like this

00:21:16.332 --> 00:21:26.862
and threw it in the sky. And there She went
and there She announced that : “Shri Krishna

00:21:26.862 --> 00:21:37.332
is already incarnated, He is living and He
is your killer.” So She is the announcer.

00:21:37.332 --> 00:21:44.302
She is the announcer of the incarnations.
She is the announcer of something good that

00:21:44.302 --> 00:21:59.822
is going to happen to you. Also She’s the
one who can burn things, which are not spiritually

00:21:59.822 --> 00:22:07.682
all right.
At the time of Mahabharata, She was born as

00:22:07.682 --> 00:22:19.212
Draupadi and this Draupadi was the sister
of Shri Rama and when, as you know in Mahabharata

00:22:19.212 --> 00:22:26.172
– all of you know the story of Mahabharata,
I need not tell that – Duryodhana tried

00:22:26.172 --> 00:22:33.242
to take out Her clothes. Then She called for
Krishna. First She said, “Kri.” She had

00:22:33.242 --> 00:22:39.542
put Her teeth like this [Shri Mataji holds
her own sari with her teeth]. Till She had

00:22:39.542 --> 00:22:44.722
said, “Krish,” [the sari] it was there.
Because She was thinking if She said “shna,”

00:22:44.722 --> 00:22:53.402
the thing will fall down and She ‘ll become
exposed. As soon as She said, “Krishna,”

00:22:53.402 --> 00:23:00.932
the thing fell down and that’s the time
Shri Krishna came all the way from Dwarika

00:23:00.932 --> 00:23:06.422
and Tulsida has here described it very well
in Hindi language : “Dwarika me Shabad gayo

00:23:06.422 --> 00:23:14.682
[message went to Dwarika]”. In Dwarika,
there was a big – big noise, you can call

00:23:14.682 --> 00:23:24.442
it or what I don’t know. “Shor bhayo,
shor bhayo bhare [caused comotion ; shora:

00:23:24.442 --> 00:23:29.582
noise, bhare : to fill] – tremendous, what
you call the – thunder, you can call it,

00:23:29.582 --> 00:23:36.452
because She was the one who’s responsible
for thunder. “Shor bhayo bhare, Shankha

00:23:36.452 --> 00:23:43.822
(conch) Chakra (disc) Gada Padma (weapon)
Garuda le sidhare” With the shankar, with

00:23:43.822 --> 00:23:52.872
Chakra, with Garuda, with Padma, all of them,
He came on the Garuda. With all His weapons,

00:23:52.872 --> 00:24:03.782
He came on a Garuda to help Her. He started
supplying the saris to Her and this Duryodhana

00:24:03.782 --> 00:24:12.242
got absolutely – Dushansana did that – got
absolutely tired and he fell on the ground.

00:24:12.242 --> 00:24:19.762
So now here, Vishnumaya is the one who is
the virgin. Not only that She is a virgin,

00:24:19.762 --> 00:24:28.302
but She exists in all the five elements as
shown that She married five Pandavas and that

00:24:28.302 --> 00:24:46.022
this power of virginity in Her used to expose
people to the dangers of these horrible Kauravas

00:24:46.022 --> 00:24:56.882
who were going to rule and destroy the dharma.
So She stood back and She is the one who said

00:24:56.882 --> 00:25:02.932
that “You have to fight. You have to fight
for dharma, whatever may happen” and Krishna

00:25:02.932 --> 00:25:09.732
always supported Her. So as a brother, Shri
Krishna supported Her, so the relationship

00:25:09.732 --> 00:25:17.562
between brother and sister are very important
in India. Also should be with Sahaja Yogis

00:25:17.562 --> 00:25:23.312
because we have raki bandhan. You also have
what you call the bhaiya duj [Hindi; Bhau

00:25:23.312 --> 00:25:29.632
bij in Marathi], where on Diwali day we tie
up a raki to the Brother. Now this raki is

00:25:29.632 --> 00:25:35.512
nothing but the Vishnumaya’s power, which
protects the brother. Actually, there the

00:25:35.512 --> 00:25:41.242
brother protected Her and now the sister’s
love protects the brother. So the relationship

00:25:41.242 --> 00:25:47.482
between brother and sister is much more important
than any other relationship because it’s

00:25:47.482 --> 00:25:55.582
so pure, it’s so protective, it’s so loving
and also it is of an equal age.

00:25:55.582 --> 00:26:02.742
For example, between the parents and the children,
cannot be that or say, between the grandparents

00:26:02.742 --> 00:26:08.872
and the children can be quite imbalanced also.
But between the brother and sister they’re

00:26:08.872 --> 00:26:15.692
of the same age group, same understanding
and this relationship is maintained by this

00:26:15.692 --> 00:26:22.162
Vishnumaya.
We have a very good incident of that in India,

00:26:22.162 --> 00:26:29.692
which I must tell you, how this Rakhi Bandhan
or this relationship between brother and sister

00:26:29.692 --> 00:26:36.382
is respected. I mean nobody will believe because
in these countries where there is no relationship

00:26:36.382 --> 00:26:42.862
which is respected, we won’t understand.
But when Alexander the Great came to India,

00:26:42.862 --> 00:26:49.812
he conquered our country quite a lot. But
there was one king Poru, who defeated him

00:26:49.812 --> 00:26:58.942
and put him in jail. Alexander had married
an Indian lady. So it was a day of this Rakhi

00:26:58.942 --> 00:27:07.242
Purnima. She put one rakhi in one plate and
covered it up and sent it to this king Poru.

00:27:07.242 --> 00:27:12.352
So they said : “a rakhi has come.” So
the King said : “All right, tie up the rakhi.”

00:27:12.352 --> 00:27:17.622
He didn’t know whose rakhi it was and it
was tied. He said, “Who’s rakhi it was?”

00:27:17.622 --> 00:27:22.332
“It’s your sister’s.” “Who is my
sister?” “She is the wife of this King

00:27:22.332 --> 00:27:29.852
Alexander.” “Oh, my God! How could I do
such a thing? He is my brother-in-law.”

00:27:29.852 --> 00:27:38.382
He immediately went to the jail and prostrated
before him. He said, “I’m sorry. Whatever

00:27:38.382 --> 00:27:45.691
I -”. This is the graciousness, you understand.
“How could I be – how could I be so stupid

00:27:45.691 --> 00:27:52.281
as to arrest you?” Alexander was flabbergasted.
He couldn’t understand this reaction. He

00:27:52.281 --> 00:28:01.791
said, “What’s this going on?” And he
said that “Now, I ask for your forgiveness

00:28:01.791 --> 00:28:07.821
and please come out.” With great pomp and
show, with ornaments for his sister and all

00:28:07.821 --> 00:28:14.541
that, he sent the brother-in-law home. Now
this Alexander could not understand. He went

00:28:14.541 --> 00:28:20.232
in and his wife was smiling. He said, “What’s
the matter? How am I here?” She said, “Do

00:28:20.232 --> 00:28:26.071
you know, I have saved you with one thread?”
She showed him a rakhi. “With this thread

00:28:26.071 --> 00:28:32.202
you saved me? How?” She said, “You know
what is today? Is a day when a sister can

00:28:32.202 --> 00:28:39.811
tie this to a brother and the brother has
to do what sister wants. So I said I sent

00:28:39.811 --> 00:28:48.472
it to this Poru, the king, and he has released
you.” Alexander thought, “What sort people

00:28:48.472 --> 00:28:53.602
these Indians are? On one thread they release
such an enemy like me. How can I rule this

00:28:53.602 --> 00:28:58.332
people? They’ll put me out any time, so
symbolic they are.” He said, “All right,

00:28:58.332 --> 00:29:04.752
I am sorry.” He took one fellow called Bardai,
Chanda Bardai, took him down – he was a

00:29:04.752 --> 00:29:10.132
poet with him, and he said, : “Now, you
write poetry because Indians are very subtle

00:29:10.132 --> 00:29:15.122
people and I can’t understand how can they
release such a horrible enemy like me, only

00:29:15.122 --> 00:29:26.512
on a thread?” Such trust, such understanding
of a brother for a sister and the sister has

00:29:26.512 --> 00:29:33.342
to keep the trust also.
So now when we go deeper into it and see for

00:29:33.342 --> 00:29:44.291
ourselves, our Vishuddhi problems is this
that we always try, in the West, to feel guilty

00:29:44.291 --> 00:29:54.332
and get out of our mistakes. For small, small
things feel guilty, people, because the norms

00:29:54.332 --> 00:30:01.512
in the West – Western life are so rigid,
like if you put a spoon on the other side,

00:30:01.512 --> 00:30:07.462
finished. I mean what does it matter? You
can take it on this side and eat it. If you

00:30:07.462 --> 00:30:16.882
spill some coffee, then that guilt will last
all your life. After all coffee is to be spilt.

00:30:16.882 --> 00:30:23.832
[big laughs] If it is hot, it can happen,
some accident can take place. And the guilt

00:30:23.832 --> 00:30:31.161
business is so great that nobody corrects
oneself, just go on feeling guilty, guilty,

00:30:31.161 --> 00:30:39.191
guilty, guilty. And all the subtleties of
life you start missing. In Sahaja Yoga, specially,

00:30:39.191 --> 00:30:46.132
to feel guilty means all your left side is
caught up. You cannot feel the vibrations

00:30:46.132 --> 00:30:51.602
properly because this is the cervical nerve
on which your guilt is sitting and it’s

00:30:51.602 --> 00:30:58.421
just clamping it, you cannot feel the left
side. You start catching on the left side

00:30:58.421 --> 00:31:07.661
till you receive some sort of a horrible disease,
then you realize.

00:31:07.661 --> 00:31:17.681
The subtler part of this Vishnumaya is that
She knows the truth. When She shines you can

00:31:17.681 --> 00:31:28.342
see everything out of Her. Even for a short
time, She exposes in the darkness everything.

00:31:28.342 --> 00:31:37.921
In the same way, when Vishnumaya starts acting
on you, then She exposes the truth to you.

00:31:37.921 --> 00:31:47.382
But supposing you continue with your left
Vishuddhi too much, then She just disappears.

00:31:47.382 --> 00:31:54.242
She’s not there to correct you, to help
you in any way or to expose you. Then you

00:31:54.242 --> 00:32:01.041
don’t feel anything. You become numb on
the left side, absolutely numb on the left

00:32:01.041 --> 00:32:12.472
side and the left side is, know, is the indicator
of all kinds of left side diseases. This is

00:32:12.472 --> 00:32:19.342
one of the reasons that we have the maximum
number of left-sided diseases in the West

00:32:19.342 --> 00:32:27.722
than in India. Indian diseases are from right
side while the left-sided diseases come from

00:32:27.722 --> 00:32:37.132
this left Vishuddhi. So to feel guilty, itself
is wrong and is a mythical thing.

00:32:37.132 --> 00:32:46.332
Now you feel guilty for something. What’s
the use of feeling guilty? It’s just a myth.

00:32:46.332 --> 00:32:53.271
It’s an empty thing you are carrying upon
yourself. No use feeling guilty. If you think

00:32:53.271 --> 00:32:59.031
you have done something wrong, just face it.
That I have done this wrong and I will not

00:32:59.031 --> 00:33:04.452
do it again. But if you feel guilty, then
you see, it’s like a stored up stuff there

00:33:04.452 --> 00:33:09.171
and then again you do the same mistake. Again
you do the same mistake and you become immune,

00:33:09.171 --> 00:33:17.962
immune to your development. Then you start
not even feeling that it is wrong, you know.

00:33:17.962 --> 00:33:25.112
People do wrong things even without thinking
that it is wrong. Even that consciousness

00:33:25.112 --> 00:33:31.901
or, you can say, that alertness is finished.
Then you think, “What’s wrong?” For

00:33:31.901 --> 00:33:38.222
anything, this is a very good answer, “What’s
wrong?” It’s like a drunkard, he starts

00:33:38.222 --> 00:33:42.132
drinking. First he feels, “Oh, I should
not have done.” Then he starts little bit

00:33:42.132 --> 00:33:47.021
more, then little bit more, little bit more.
Ultimately, he’ll say “What’s wrong?

00:33:47.021 --> 00:33:47.921
If I’m drinking is perfect.”

00:33:47.921 --> 00:33:57.761
Anything of that kind starts with left Vishuddhi
because we do not face the mistake. It’s

00:33:57.761 --> 00:34:05.901
not true that because your tradition has been
very short or anything, it’s only thing

00:34:05.901 --> 00:34:14.161
your attitude. Because it is Krishna’s place,
especially for Americans, it is very important

00:34:14.161 --> 00:34:19.671
to face their mistakes and to admit, “All
right, I have done this mistake and I’m

00:34:19.671 --> 00:34:22.852
not going to do it.”

00:34:22.852 --> 00:34:29.921
So because they do not want to admit, they
put up this arrogant behavior. I know underneath

00:34:29.921 --> 00:34:41.722
this arrogant there’s somebody who is very
guilty. They are, actually, here very collective,

00:34:41.722 --> 00:34:51.021
also, very collective in the sense they will
be worried about Vietnam, Korea, everything.

00:34:51.021 --> 00:34:56.161
Anything happens in the world they are worried
about. They are, they are the ones who started

00:34:56.161 --> 00:35:02.671
UN and every sort of thing, you see. Everything
is there. But despite all that, this guilt

00:35:02.671 --> 00:35:11.381
business makes them very insensitive, very
insensitive to things which are reality.

00:35:11.381 --> 00:35:20.061
Anything which is negative, they should face
that thing as negative that they don’t face.

00:35:20.061 --> 00:35:26.031
They will support a country which is despotic
despite the fact they are democratic country.

00:35:26.031 --> 00:35:32.872
All such things, not only in politics, but
also in day to day life. Then the whole thing

00:35:32.872 --> 00:35:44.071
becomes such a lifestyle. It becomes a lifestyle.
The whole thing becomes collective. Nobody

00:35:44.071 --> 00:35:49.862
ever can come and say that this is something
we are doing wrong and we should stop it.

00:35:49.862 --> 00:35:54.232
If somebody says that or they say he’s mad,
he’s no good.

00:35:54.232 --> 00:36:00.862
For Freud, I was telling you that Freud was
denounced by many people and people gave some

00:36:00.862 --> 00:36:07.582
papers, everything happened, but nobody would
listen to them. And the same thing happened

00:36:07.582 --> 00:36:14.911
with Sahaja Yoga also. They would not listen
to Me because they have developed a immunity

00:36:14.911 --> 00:36:24.972
against reality. In everything, whatever is
real they become immune to it. They do not

00:36:24.972 --> 00:36:35.742
want to face it. ‘That’s too much, much
too much for me.’ With this kind of an attitude,

00:36:35.742 --> 00:36:42.252
they had to work out something else and in
that they have gone to the right side. With

00:36:42.252 --> 00:36:48.261
that they have developed all kind of machinery,
science, all this, everything. But science

00:36:48.261 --> 00:36:55.962
is not conclusive. It cannot give you the
totality. It cannot give the reality.

00:36:55.962 --> 00:37:06.011
So this Vishnumaya shows Her strength. She
does lots of things by which people are frightened.

00:37:06.011 --> 00:37:19.742
She can enter into any, any element. She can
permeate. Supposing She enters into a water

00:37:19.742 --> 00:37:29.311
element, She can create a typhoon. She can
create any kind of disasters. She can enter

00:37:29.311 --> 00:37:40.691
into Mother Earth and She can create a earthquake.
She can do anything because She has a power

00:37:40.691 --> 00:37:45.161
to enter into anything. You know that She
can enter into Mother Earth very easily. She

00:37:45.161 --> 00:37:51.212
can enter into water very easily and when
She gets into it, She becomes the catalyst.

00:37:51.212 --> 00:38:00.511
And all these problems that you are facing
today in America are because of left Vishuddhi,

00:38:00.511 --> 00:38:01.901
because of Vishnumaya.

00:38:01.901 --> 00:38:09.571
I’m happy today’s program has been arranged
for Vishnumaya because this is the power which

00:38:09.571 --> 00:38:19.401
you Sahaja Yogis should be able to harness
and should be able to worship so that She

00:38:19.401 --> 00:38:26.441
sees all of you there and She looks after
you and She maintains your life and looks

00:38:26.441 --> 00:38:30.352
after you.

00:38:30.352 --> 00:38:43.551
Now the most difficult thing is to convince
people in America that money’s not everything.

00:38:43.551 --> 00:38:54.161
You may have any amount of money, you may
have any amount of so-called pleasures, everything,

00:38:54.161 --> 00:39:01.722
but still, you can never be satisfied and
you can never be at peace with yourself and

00:39:01.722 --> 00:39:11.771
you cannot generate peace. Money cannot replace
reality. It’s just there.

00:39:11.771 --> 00:39:22.771
Now the problem is that people become so addicted
to this money that all value systems start

00:39:22.771 --> 00:39:38.742
going down. I was surprised I knew somebody
here who took his own sister for prostitution.

00:39:38.742 --> 00:39:42.061
So I said, “What’s this? What are you
doing?”

00:39:42.061 --> 00:39:45.592
“What’s wrong? We’ll get money.”

00:39:45.592 --> 00:39:53.171
So whatever can get money, they indulge into.
So there’s no chastity which is the basics,

00:39:53.171 --> 00:40:04.551
which is the foundation of human beings. As
a result, when you insult this virginity of

00:40:04.551 --> 00:40:14.472
Vishnumaya, then the Maya – means the – Her
play is that you get AIDS, you get all kinds

00:40:14.472 --> 00:40:20.161
of other diseases which are incurable and
which are what you can call as the secret

00:40:20.161 --> 00:40:34.431
diseases. Because She’s the virgin and because
She respects the virginity. And those who

00:40:34.431 --> 00:40:41.582
go against, not that virginity is meant only
for women, also meant for men, because everybody

00:40:41.582 --> 00:40:48.342
has here left Vishuddhi. Here the idea is
that only the virginity is word used for women

00:40:48.342 --> 00:40:57.191
only. It’s not. Even the men who do not
respect their virginity, their chastity are

00:40:57.191 --> 00:41:03.691
attacked by Vishnumaya in different ways.
I’m not surprised that Los Angeles, they

00:41:03.691 --> 00:41:10.881
say, is in danger all the time, because of
your cinemas you produce, all these things

00:41:10.881 --> 00:41:15.031
you produce.

00:41:15.031 --> 00:41:22.281
Of course, I mean now with the Sahaja Yoga
being established very well in Los Angeles,

00:41:22.281 --> 00:41:29.871
thing may be averted, but still it’s very
dangerous. It’s one of the most powerful

00:41:29.871 --> 00:41:44.271
Shakti is this of Vishnumaya because She plays
the illusion. She creates the Maya also. Also

00:41:44.271 --> 00:41:53.751
She breaks the Maya and She can burn anything.
Your forest is burning now. Sixty-five hectares

00:41:53.751 --> 00:42:03.712
of land is burning. Who has done this? Is
nothing but Vishnumaya. Nobody has to take

00:42:03.712 --> 00:42:12.141
any matchbox for that. She can burn anything
and is Her burning gives you the feeling that

00:42:12.141 --> 00:42:22.621
if there’s an electrical charge, as if burnt
with electrical charge. This is very true

00:42:22.621 --> 00:42:29.911
in so many cases I’ve seen. Those who came
to Me with problems of left Vishuddhi, that

00:42:29.911 --> 00:42:34.342
they said that, “We think that there’s
some electrical charge coming out of here.”

00:42:34.342 --> 00:42:44.462
As if it’s the burning of an electrical
shock. This is Vishnumaya’s doing and She’s

00:42:44.462 --> 00:42:53.722
the one who is the corrector. She corrects.
Don’t feel guilty. Face your problems. It’s

00:42:53.722 --> 00:43:05.071
sort of when we hide our mistakes in the name
of guilt, when we try to camouflage it, She’s

00:43:05.071 --> 00:43:18.112
the one who exposes it on individual level,
on collective level, on national level, international

00:43:18.112 --> 00:43:28.011
level. Because She can permeate into anything
and this permeation of Hers gives Her such

00:43:28.011 --> 00:43:41.501
subtleties. But people cannot relate disaster
to their mistakes. They cannot. They don’t

00:43:41.501 --> 00:43:48.191
understand why such a disaster has taken place,
what has happened.

00:43:48.191 --> 00:43:59.862
There was a big typhoon that came, came up
to a point and suddenly turned towards Kauai.

00:43:59.862 --> 00:44:06.651
Now what was the reason for that, to go and
hit Kauai? In Kauai there is a Swayambu of

00:44:06.651 --> 00:44:14.962
Shiva, is a fact. People are making money
out of it, quite a lot of money and deceiving

00:44:14.962 --> 00:44:24.431
people. There’s big business going on in
the name of Shiva. So Kauai was hit, not Hawaii

00:44:24.431 --> 00:44:31.151
so much as Kauai, and it turned suddenly,
no one can understand that.

00:44:31.151 --> 00:44:37.732
So all these thundering things that are coming
from nature, anything, whether it is earthquake

00:44:37.732 --> 00:44:47.322
or it is landslide or it could be floods or
it could be typhoon, anything is the work

00:44:47.322 --> 00:44:55.702
of this Vishnumaya or we can say all natural
catastrophes are brought about by this Vishnumaya.

00:44:55.702 --> 00:45:02.181
She has this power to do it. This is the only
way they can shock people, but despite all

00:45:02.181 --> 00:45:09.632
that shocking, people have to relate these
disasters so their mistakes that they have

00:45:09.632 --> 00:45:15.782
committed and have nicely kept it here, not
facing it.

00:45:15.782 --> 00:45:22.702
I’ve heard from some Indian students that
when they came to America some boys asked

00:45:22.702 --> 00:45:27.942
them to take drugs and do all other things
also. So they wouldn’t do. They said, “You

00:45:27.942 --> 00:45:31.462
are goody-goodies,” this, that. You know,
they just pumped it into their head that,

00:45:31.462 --> 00:45:38.512
“You have to do it. You are cowards. You
cannot do it.” And all that. So some of

00:45:38.512 --> 00:45:42.822
them said, “All right, we’ll try.” But
what surprised them that they knew it was

00:45:42.822 --> 00:45:46.432
wrong while those who were telling them never
thought it was wrong. They thought they have

00:45:46.432 --> 00:45:54.162
been great martyrs or they have been liberators
and they have got liberties. They couldn’t

00:45:54.162 --> 00:45:55.582
understand this.

00:45:55.582 --> 00:46:04.702
This kind of liberty that they were boasting
of was so destructive. They’d never understood

00:46:04.702 --> 00:46:13.072
that this is destructive. So once your left
Vishuddhi is absolutely jammed, you lose complete

00:46:13.072 --> 00:46:22.492
discretion of the chakra here which we call
as Hamsa chakra and then you do not know what

00:46:22.492 --> 00:46:27.852
is destructive, what is constructive. You
start accepting mostly the destructive thing

00:46:27.852 --> 00:46:39.922
if your left Vishuddhi is bad. Escape. “So
what. What wrong?” That is how violence

00:46:39.922 --> 00:46:49.852
has come. That is how all kind of cheating,
corruption has come. “What’s wrong?”

00:46:49.852 --> 00:46:53.742
Because if you do anything wrong you put it
there. Finished. Stored up.. Again, you do

00:46:53.742 --> 00:47:01.042
anything, you put it there and till you become
absolutely immune to all destructive action,

00:47:01.042 --> 00:47:05.572
you go on doing.

00:47:05.572 --> 00:47:15.182
So to get out of it, what to do. To get out
of this horrible state where you do not feel

00:47:15.182 --> 00:47:23.042
anything wrong, what is the thing is only
is to take to Sahaja Yoga in a right fashion.

00:47:23.042 --> 00:47:37.672
First of all, you must face yourself. If you
start facing yourself, you’ll realize that

00:47:37.672 --> 00:47:45.302
you have committed a mistake. “So this is
the mistake I have committed. Doesn’t matter.

00:47:45.302 --> 00:47:50.842
I am not going to feel guilty about it. If
I ever have to do this, I will not do it and

00:47:50.842 --> 00:47:55.682
I’m not guilty for whatever has happened.
Is the past. Finished.”

00:47:55.682 --> 00:48:04.902
With this faith in yourself, you can definitely
get rid of your left Vishuddhi. The problem

00:48:04.902 --> 00:48:12.282
is even if I tell you something, I am worried
that you start feeling guilty about it also.

00:48:12.282 --> 00:48:16.942
I mean, I am telling you for something for
your correction. Then you start guilty that,

00:48:16.942 --> 00:48:23.092
“Oh, I – Mother is saying, so you see,
I did this and -” that you did. At this

00:48:23.092 --> 00:48:30.952
moment what I am telling you, never to do
it again. And face it. Whatever you did is

00:48:30.952 --> 00:48:40.752
finished and gone and is forgiven completely,
otherwise Vishnumaya will take over. This

00:48:40.752 --> 00:48:51.092
is very important because one side is the
leela, it’s a play and it’s all the world

00:48:51.092 --> 00:48:57.932
is beautiful. The another side is the guilt.

00:48:57.932 --> 00:49:03.922
So we think that by just feeling guilty, we
are solving all our problems and this side

00:49:03.922 --> 00:49:09.902
we are enjoying ourselves and this, the guilt
part, is just like a storehouse of a garbage

00:49:09.902 --> 00:49:18.192
we put there. But we never think this garbage
what it is wrong, it is doing to us. And this

00:49:18.192 --> 00:49:27.142
is what it is that Vishnumaya has to burn
this garbage, then She works in Her own ways,

00:49:27.142 --> 00:49:30.412
in Her own Maya ways and so many things happen.

00:49:30.412 --> 00:49:37.862
Like there was a lady and she was very right-sided.
She used to dominate everyone, but nobody

00:49:37.862 --> 00:49:43.172
dared tell her that because, if you tell her,
she would come back on you. So nobody wanted

00:49:43.172 --> 00:49:47.302
to tell her what’s wrong with her. They
said, “All right. Let it be.” But I told

00:49:47.302 --> 00:49:52.272
her, “That you see you are very right-sided.
You are dominating everyone. Everybody’s

00:49:52.272 --> 00:49:56.212
frightened of you.” So she said, “No,
Mother, I’m not.” I said, “All right

00:49:56.212 --> 00:50:03.812
I’m telling you. You better believe Me or
really you are in for trouble.” And that

00:50:03.812 --> 00:50:10.222
very day she was getting down from the staircase
and she fell from top to bottom she did and

00:50:10.222 --> 00:50:15.632
all her right side. She came to Me, “Mother,
you see.” Her right hand is broken. “My

00:50:15.632 --> 00:50:22.642
right leg is broken. This is broken. That
is broken.” I said, “Then you know what

00:50:22.642 --> 00:50:29.812
happened.” “I now know why it has happened.”
Then I cured her. She was all right. But what

00:50:29.812 --> 00:50:36.522
I am trying to tell you that she wouldn’t
listen to Me. So the right-sided people have

00:50:36.522 --> 00:50:45.442
a special capacity to put everything here.
So I always say that it is the by-product

00:50:45.442 --> 00:50:58.412
of ego. Those people who try to dominate,
who try to be angry, try to control everyone,

00:50:58.412 --> 00:51:09.172
they put it down there and then the whole
thing works against them. This is to be understood

00:51:09.172 --> 00:51:15.432
in a very serious manner, that feeling guilty
is not that you are harming yourself, but

00:51:15.432 --> 00:51:18.922
you are harming all others.

00:51:18.922 --> 00:51:29.312
Also this Vishnumaya gets very upset with
two other things. One of the things is smoking.

00:51:29.312 --> 00:51:38.302
If you smoke too much, then this Vishnumaya
gets very angry. She is the one who then causes

00:51:38.302 --> 00:51:47.232
cancer. She can spoil your throat. I mean,
all kinds of ear, nose, throat problems can

00:51:47.232 --> 00:51:56.492
come in with the smoking because She doesn’t
like that smoke. She – once, twice, thrice

00:51:56.492 --> 00:52:03.412
– but once you start smoking and after some
time, “Oh, what’s wrong?” They will

00:52:03.412 --> 00:52:10.162
quote such and such man who is eighty-three,
he still smokes. See, quoting like this, they

00:52:10.162 --> 00:52:16.182
have ideals like this. Then you have also
some cinema heroes. “Such and such man,

00:52:16.182 --> 00:52:23.542
see, he murdered his wife. He’s not – see,
he’s going along.” So we should also murder.

00:52:23.542 --> 00:52:28.832
We should also smoke. So the all ideals which
have destroyed themselves become our ideals

00:52:28.832 --> 00:52:37.342
and we start exactly doing what they are doing
without knowing that how they are destroyed,

00:52:37.342 --> 00:52:39.482
we’ll be also destroyed.

00:52:39.482 --> 00:52:51.602
So this understanding about Vishnumaya’s
powers should be there with us. That if we

00:52:51.602 --> 00:53:04.252
try to continue with our mistakes and putting
them here, then first thing we become vulnerable

00:53:04.252 --> 00:53:14.082
to all kinds of diseases. With that if you
are smoking, you can become also very much

00:53:14.082 --> 00:53:24.022
vulnerable to cancer of the throat. Another
thing which people do not know is the mantras.

00:53:24.022 --> 00:53:29.872
If you go on saying any mantra – I mean
in India there are people who will every day,

00:53:29.872 --> 00:53:37.992
morning get up and say some mantra for about,
say, hundred times, some say it at least three

00:53:37.992 --> 00:53:43.422
hundred times, five hundred times. They go
on measuring, mantra, mantra, mantra, mantra,

00:53:43.422 --> 00:53:51.662
like that. Now She’s the mantrika. She’s
the one who gives the power to the mantra.

00:53:51.662 --> 00:54:00.232
Now if you are not connected to this Divine
Power, then there’s a short-circuiting takes

00:54:00.232 --> 00:54:05.562
place and if you go on saying this mantra,
you develop all the troubles of the throat,

00:54:05.562 --> 00:54:11.782
throat cancer. You can develop also stomach,
in the stomach, problems because it is Krishna

00:54:11.782 --> 00:54:21.382
and Vishnu are the same. You might develop
also the problem of Virata. Because you are

00:54:21.382 --> 00:54:29.972
reciting a mantra like this, you see – a
telephone, if it is not connected, I go on

00:54:29.972 --> 00:54:33.962
using it, the telephone will go out of order.

00:54:33.962 --> 00:54:42.502
In the same way, if you are doing wrong mantras
in the sense that the mantras which are said

00:54:42.502 --> 00:54:49.732
before you have connection with the Divine,
then they can spoil your left Vishuddhi, like

00:54:49.732 --> 00:54:58.402
this. This is the style they use in India.
Supposing you are a business man in India.

00:54:58.402 --> 00:55:03.422
Now a big business man, you have made a lot
of money, now you feel guilty about it because

00:55:03.422 --> 00:55:09.712
you have made by bad means, also by all kinds
of black-market and all that sort of things.

00:55:09.712 --> 00:55:19.192
So they’ll make a big temple of Vishnu,
not Vishuddhi but they’ll make a very big

00:55:19.192 --> 00:55:27.092
temple of Shri Vishnu and they will create
a kind of image that they are great religious

00:55:27.092 --> 00:55:32.952
people. Or they’ll have khairat, means they
will distribute food to people or distribute

00:55:32.952 --> 00:55:40.192
some things to people and feel satisfied.
Here you go on committing any amount of sins,

00:55:40.192 --> 00:55:50.512
any amount of nonsense and then out of that
money you make a little contribution to Shri

00:55:50.512 --> 00:55:56.972
Vishnu thinking that Shri Vishnu will be very
happy and will not punish them. But He’s

00:55:56.972 --> 00:56:02.162
Kubera, what can you give it to Him. He’s
the Kubera. He gives you all the money. He

00:56:02.162 --> 00:56:12.482
does everything. So how can you give anything
to Kubera who is Himself the Lord of wealth.

00:56:12.482 --> 00:56:18.542
It’s a very common thing in India, like
there was a bhudan [donating land] thing.

00:56:18.542 --> 00:56:25.222
I knew of a man who was very corrupt, very
bad person, I mean really, he was really very,

00:56:25.222 --> 00:56:30.632
very bad man and he had taken away so much
land from the poor farmers and all that. So

00:56:30.632 --> 00:56:39.802
he gave one land to Mahatma Gandhi and this
land, this bhudan land was no good, it was,

00:56:39.802 --> 00:56:46.802
you know, I think why he gave. This land was
so bad that you could not put even cactus

00:56:46.802 --> 00:56:55.462
there and he was telling everybody, “I have
given so much land to bhudan. I have given

00:56:55.462 --> 00:57:00.132
so much land to bhudan.” So trying to sort
of justify himself for taking all the land

00:57:00.132 --> 00:57:08.272
from the poor and flinching them and then
to do this kind of a generosity.

00:57:08.272 --> 00:57:17.332
So this is another escape people have, that
do what you like and ultimately be generous.

00:57:17.332 --> 00:57:27.722
This kind of gracious covering of your mistakes
can be very misleading. It doesn’t work

00:57:27.722 --> 00:57:34.272
with Vishnumaya. She knows you out and out
and if you try all these tricks with Her,

00:57:34.272 --> 00:57:41.912
She will show Her own powers. I would say
all our left side problems come because of

00:57:41.912 --> 00:57:51.812
Vishnumaya power. She punishes you, as well
as She exposes, as well as She gives you light,

00:57:51.812 --> 00:57:55.422
as well as She corrects you.

00:57:55.422 --> 00:58:05.932
With all these powers of Vishnumaya, we should
be very thankful that today we are celebrating

00:58:05.932 --> 00:58:12.272
Her special puja because I think it is one
of the curses of the West, especially of Americans

00:58:12.272 --> 00:58:14.452
to feel guilty.

00:58:14.452 --> 00:58:21.182
So today you all have to promise in your heart
that the mantra is – now She also understands

00:58:21.182 --> 00:58:28.162
English perhaps – you can say that, “Mother,
I am not guilty at all.” That’s all. If

00:58:28.162 --> 00:58:32.202
that is said, She will be very happy. “I’m
not guilty at all. I’m not going to feel

00:58:32.202 --> 00:58:38.482
guilty.” Once you stop feeling guilty you
will not do wrong things because how will

00:58:38.482 --> 00:58:43.292
you manage. Because you are not doing, you
cannot put it as guilt, so what’s the use

00:58:43.292 --> 00:58:48.022
of doing anything wrong. If you do wrong,
it comes on your head, you cannot put it in

00:58:48.022 --> 00:58:55.802
your left Vishuddhi, so you won’t do anything
wrong. You will immediately understand that

00:58:55.802 --> 00:59:01.062
if I have to do wrong, I have to face it.
But if there’s a space here, kept where

00:59:01.062 --> 00:59:08.792
you can put your guilt for your wrong doings
available, then you don’t mind so much.

00:59:08.792 --> 00:59:12.532
Supposing somebody has a small house, no place
to store, then somebody brings something.

00:59:12.532 --> 00:59:22.152
Says, “No, no, no, no space here. I am all
ready very full.” It’s like that.

00:59:22.152 --> 00:59:29.022
So the best thing is to have no guilt at any
cost. I will have no guilt. If I have done

00:59:29.022 --> 00:59:34.852
mistake, all right I’ll admit I have done
the mistake and I’ll have no guilt at all

00:59:34.852 --> 00:59:40.902
about it. I’ll face it. You’ll be surprised.
You’ll stop doing wrong things. Definitely

00:59:40.902 --> 00:59:44.332
you’ll stop because there’s no space left.

00:59:44.332 --> 00:59:52.962
So this is very important today to do Vishnumaya’s
thing and I am sure now very happy with the

00:59:52.962 --> 00:59:58.952
tour of America. This time I’m really happy
because I think it has worked in most of the

00:59:58.952 --> 01:00:06.842
places very well, and if it has not worked,
one should not feel guilty, but face the problem,

01:00:06.842 --> 01:00:15.072
why it has not worked and the problem lies
with Sahaja Yogis and nobody else. You shouldn’t

01:00:15.072 --> 01:00:22.282
blame anybody else for it. Just see yourself,
what mistakes you must have committed. Could

01:00:22.282 --> 01:00:29.492
be a small or big mistake. Whatever it is,
face it. There’s no harm in saying, “I

01:00:29.492 --> 01:00:35.732
have done mistake.” But if you say, “Sorry,”
means it goes there, straight off. No, “I

01:00:35.732 --> 01:00:44.592
have committed a mistake.” To admit that
is very gracious, very beautiful and very

01:00:44.592 --> 01:00:46.672
kind to yourself for your benevolence.

01:00:46.672 --> 01:00:53.762
In Sahaja Yoga it’s one of the biggest mantras
for all the Western people. They should all

01:00:53.762 --> 01:01:02.142
the time say to all the trees, all the nature
around, “I am not guilty”. Your ecological

01:01:02.142 --> 01:01:10.192
problem will improve because then you won’t
do wrong things to spoil your ecology. You’ll

01:01:10.192 --> 01:01:14.582
be careful because you spoil it and you’ll
feel guilty, “Oh, I should not have done

01:01:14.582 --> 01:01:19.882
this. Oh, I should not.” But why did you
do in the first place is the point. So now,

01:01:19.882 --> 01:01:22.992
next time you are not going to do it.

01:01:22.992 --> 01:01:30.262
So many of our problems will be solved if
you face them and correct them boldly. It’s

01:01:30.262 --> 01:01:35.652
possible for Sahaja Yogis because you are
separated from your being, you’re away from

01:01:35.652 --> 01:01:41.472
it. You can see your body, you can see your
mind, you can see your ego, you can see all

01:01:41.472 --> 01:01:47.962
of those things and you know how to put them
right. You are not that, you know, so you

01:01:47.962 --> 01:01:55.142
are the spirit and with the light of the spirit
you can correct all these things. But this

01:01:55.142 --> 01:02:01.622
guilt is something where it stops you completely
from correcting or doing anything better about

01:02:01.622 --> 01:02:07.372
it or bringing any constructive thing to your
own mind.

01:02:07.372 --> 01:02:16.372
This will solve many problems for America,
as well as for all the Western world. Same

01:02:16.372 --> 01:02:22.302
with the Indians, that they should not think
that if they are generous a little bit they

01:02:22.302 --> 01:02:26.632
can get rid of their mistakes. See, they have
to face it. It’s a different style. Indians

01:02:26.632 --> 01:02:34.932
are very clever, you know, they know how to
find excuses and escapes. But after all, it

01:02:34.932 --> 01:02:42.202
is Vishnumaya. She will show you that there
is no escape, just face it. There’s no need

01:02:42.202 --> 01:02:49.782
to condemn yourself, no need to, in any way,
degrade yourself or to feel inferior, but

01:02:49.782 --> 01:02:55.392
to be superior as the spirit, I see. Like
I would say, “All right, Nirmala, I see

01:02:55.392 --> 01:03:00.992
you very well now, you did this.” Separate
yourself from yourself. You can talk on the

01:03:00.992 --> 01:03:08.202
mirror. You can go to the river and talk there
or you can go to an ocean and tell them that,

01:03:08.202 --> 01:03:13.922
“See, I’ve done this mistake and now I’m
not going to do it.” You can make promises

01:03:13.922 --> 01:03:15.752
to all of these elements.

01:03:15.752 --> 01:03:22.572
Once you make these promises, this Vishnumaya
will receive the message and She won’t enter

01:03:22.572 --> 01:03:27.212
into any one of these elements to disturb
you. So you have to go and tell the ocean

01:03:27.212 --> 01:03:34.982
that, “All right, America is not guilty
for whatever they have done.” Say like that.

01:03:34.982 --> 01:03:40.242
If you say is all right, not other people
because I told your genetics are changed.

01:03:40.242 --> 01:03:47.102
You are different people. Whatever you say,
Vishnumaya will always believe in and everything

01:03:47.102 --> 01:03:49.642
will work out very well.

01:03:49.642 --> 01:03:56.022
But this is a special time, as I told you
before where we call it is the Krita Yuga,

01:03:56.022 --> 01:04:01.892
where between the Kali Yuga and Satya Yuga
this time is so important that whatever mistakes

01:04:01.892 --> 01:04:06.272
we have committed, we have to pay for it.
Is a karmaphala [consequences of past deeds].

01:04:06.272 --> 01:04:10.502
It won’t work out by just putting it here.

01:04:10.502 --> 01:04:19.172
So one has to get to realization, change the
genetics completely and then you can go and

01:04:19.172 --> 01:04:24.482
tell the nature that, “All right, we are
not guilty now. We have got our realization.”

01:04:24.482 --> 01:04:30.922
And it will work, I am sure. So many of catastrophes
of this country can be avoided by you Sahaja Yogis.

01:04:30.922 --> 01:04:33.082
May God bless you!
