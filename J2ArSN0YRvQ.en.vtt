00:00:07.318 --> 00:00:10.120
People have ideas about sympathies,

00:00:10.241 --> 00:00:14.034
ideas about being, you see, kind to others,

00:00:14.155 --> 00:00:16.660
and compassionate to others.

00:00:16.951 --> 00:00:20.487
But what is a human compassion, it doesn’t do anything it just talks.

00:00:20.608 --> 00:00:24.001
While the God’s compassion works, it works.

00:00:24.121 --> 00:00:28.888
It works on people, it doesn’t talk that, “Oh, I’m very compassionate,

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:33.494
I’m full of compassion,” nothing, it just works, it manifests itself.

00:00:33.615 --> 00:00:38.872
So one should understand to be a complete ego-less personality,

00:00:38.993 --> 00:00:45.857
one should try to obey the Self within yourself.

00:00:45.978 --> 00:00:49.175
Now how do you obey yourself within yourself?

00:00:49.296 --> 00:00:51.905
It is through vibratory awareness.

00:00:52.522 --> 00:00:56.077
Try to obey through your vibratory awareness.

00:00:56.198 --> 00:00:59.343
Any question you want to ask, anything you want to do,

00:00:59.464 --> 00:01:04.117
you must obey it through your vibratory awareness.

00:01:04.238 --> 00:01:07.776
Now some people are not so sensitive, that’s true.

00:01:07.897 --> 00:01:11.852
The reason why they are not sensitive is because they think about it.

00:01:11.972 --> 00:01:15.304
Now you think with your brain, all right?

00:01:15.425 --> 00:01:18.159
If your brain can be enlightened,

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.987
then you will think as the Divine thinks and your sensitivity will improve,

00:01:23.108 --> 00:01:26.629
because sensitivity comes from the central nervous system.

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:29.499
Now in the central nervous system if there is any blockage

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.550
it is actually in the brain

00:01:31.671 --> 00:01:35.554
because all the centers are represented in the brain.

00:01:35.675 --> 00:01:38.050
So the best thing is to say that,

00:01:38.171 --> 00:01:43.187
“Mother come in my brain. Please reside in my brain.

00:01:43.308 --> 00:01:46.707
Please make Your room in this brain.

00:01:46.827 --> 00:01:49.627
You be the controller of this brain.

00:01:49.748 --> 00:01:53.484
Let this brain be guided by Your divine wisdom."

00:01:53.605 --> 00:01:55.683
And you don’t think for yourself,

00:01:55.804 --> 00:01:59.491
and this word ‘I think’ should be dropped completely from Sahaja Yogis.

00:01:59.612 --> 00:02:02.690
‘I think’ means, goes on you see, in funny ways;

00:02:02.811 --> 00:02:04.916
it can be anything, you see.

00:02:05.037 --> 00:02:07.813
Like once we went out and we had

00:02:07.934 --> 00:02:13.462
one of my very stupid relations staying with us, a girl.

00:02:13.583 --> 00:02:17.093
And as I was going out – we had no servants that day,

00:02:17.215 --> 00:02:20.668
so I was cooking – but that day when we were going out I said to her,

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:24.457
“I’m going in the morning, so can you make a little bit of khichdi  for us

00:02:24.578 --> 00:02:27.089
and when we come back we’ll have it."

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.164
That’s the only cooking she did in her lifetime, maybe she did not do also.

00:02:31.285 --> 00:02:36.575
So when we came back she told Me that she has not cooked.

00:02:36.695 --> 00:02:38.464
So I said, “Why? Why didn’t you cook,

00:02:38.585 --> 00:02:41.030
because we were supposed to take our food here."

00:02:41.151 --> 00:02:45.320
She said, “I thought that maybe you may not come.

00:02:45.441 --> 00:02:49.191
Maybe you’re not hungry, maybe you may not like to eat.

00:02:49.312 --> 00:02:51.092
Maybe I may not cook well,”

00:02:51.213 --> 00:02:54.287
you see, all these four alternatives not to do the cooking.

00:02:54.408 --> 00:02:59.328
But I said, “Why didn’t you think that we may be hungry, that we will eat.

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:01.250
Why didn’t you think this way?”

00:03:01.374 --> 00:03:04.390
“But I thought,” you see this is an explanation

00:03:04.511 --> 00:03:09.318
for not having one in the brain I should say,

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:14.369
that there is no Divine guidance in the brain.

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.097
Then the guidance comes from your ego

00:03:18.218 --> 00:03:22.898
or from your superego, which says, “I thought that this might happen."

00:03:23.018 --> 00:03:25.715
But how, why, why did you think like that?

00:03:25.836 --> 00:03:27.757
Why not the other way round?

00:03:27.878 --> 00:03:29.875
Why didn’t you think the other way round?

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:33.859
And the problem is this brain of yours, you see, when it comes in between,

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.746
which is nothing compared to that big brain, you see.

00:03:36.867 --> 00:03:41.410
Your brain is nothing but like a little mosquito, it comes up, comes here

00:03:41.531 --> 00:03:43.921
and there, says, “Oh, this, this, this, this, this”

00:03:44.042 --> 00:03:45.780
and then the problem starts.

00:03:45.901 --> 00:03:50.578
But if you really start using this power within you,

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:55.656
God has made you as the best instrument that you could think.

00:03:55.793 --> 00:03:59.758
And as you start using your instrument with that wisdom

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:06.047
and surrender or humility, gradually it evolves more and more and more,

00:04:06.168 --> 00:04:13.078
and you start developing more sensitive sides, or we can say

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:16.597
evolving a new method in this

00:04:16.718 --> 00:04:22.393
and getting a better and better understanding of the working of Sahaja Yoga.

00:04:22.649 --> 00:04:26.391
So it is important that first of all you must decide

00:04:26.512 --> 00:04:30.816
to stop the brain working too much and say that

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:32.543
“Mother You be in our brain."

00:04:32.664 --> 00:04:35.857
Thank God I’m before you in person, it’s not difficult.

00:04:35.977 --> 00:04:39.399
Just say that “Mother, You have to be in our brain."

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.598
Now this brain is as you know, is supported by the five elements,

00:04:44.718 --> 00:04:49.168
they all are in this brain and if you can somehow or other

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:52.852
bring Me in that brain, somehow or other, by telling your brain,

00:04:52.973 --> 00:04:56.993
now, not to disturb you any more, you’ll be amazed that

00:04:57.114 --> 00:05:03.281
immediately the whole system will start working like a dynamo.

00:05:03.407 --> 00:05:06.662
It will be such a sensitive thing, you don’t have worry about anything,

00:05:06.782 --> 00:05:08.434
don’t have to think about anything.

00:05:08.555 --> 00:05:12.360
You touch anything it becomes gold sort of thing, you see becomes Midas’ touch,

00:05:12.481 --> 00:05:13.913
becomes such a great thing.

00:05:14.034 --> 00:05:16.922
But that, to achieve, is difficult for human beings.

00:05:17.109 --> 00:05:22.562
They find it difficult to achieve that kind of a perfection

00:05:22.683 --> 00:05:29.099
where you lose completely your ego and you become egoless.

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:34.339
Like the fire, the Mother Earth, like all other elements – they have no ego.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.632
It’s only human beings who have built the ego.

00:05:36.753 --> 00:05:40.796
And the ego is such a big myth. Of course when you don’t do anything,

00:05:40.917 --> 00:05:43.554
why should you think you are doing something,

00:05:43.675 --> 00:05:46.804
and why should you be responsible for doing anything?

00:05:46.933 --> 00:05:49.477
But the thing is, we think that,

00:05:49.598 --> 00:05:54.390
“No it’s not God, we have to do this thing,” and “I have to decide."

00:05:54.511 --> 00:05:57.975
You see it’s just we play tricks with ourselves morning till evening

00:05:58.096 --> 00:06:01.827
spoiling our brain, absolutely becoming mad.

00:06:01.948 --> 00:06:04.085
Best thing is to surrender

00:06:04.206 --> 00:06:07.200
and see the things will come before you, you’ll be amazed,

00:06:07.321 --> 00:06:10.796
oh, how it has happened, how it has worked out.

00:06:10.917 --> 00:06:14.178
The other day I told just Kerry, “You better go and register yourself."

00:06:14.299 --> 00:06:18.825
She said, “Mother the university has closed down these days,

00:06:18.946 --> 00:06:21.193
I can’t get into it, it’s very difficult."

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:23.711
I said, “All right I’ve said it, you go."

00:06:23.792 --> 00:06:26.996
Then she telephoned, they said, “It’s impossible, you just can’t do it

00:06:27.077 --> 00:06:28.805
but if you want you can come and see."

00:06:28.886 --> 00:06:31.250
And as she walked into the university in the office

00:06:31.371 --> 00:06:34.048
they said, “All right, come along you are registered."

00:06:39.057 --> 00:06:42.007
It is, so many times it will happen to you people.

00:06:42.128 --> 00:06:49.124
But it took about ten minutes for Me to convince her that you just try it.

00:06:49.245 --> 00:06:53.329
But I must say still she was not so adamant she was thinking,

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:57.311
” If Mother is saying, I may get it this thing, it will work out."

00:06:57.432 --> 00:07:02.561
But if you suppose, “It’s all right, Mother You are saying, I’m just going to register, finished."

00:07:02.682 --> 00:07:07.389
Then what happens even if you do not get registered doesn’t matter.

00:07:07.517 --> 00:07:11.662
That’s not important. Your brain improves.

00:07:11.783 --> 00:07:15.553
That’s important, that your brain improves, it becomes more sensitive.

00:07:15.674 --> 00:07:19.545
It’s not important that the work should be done, that’s not important.

00:07:19.666 --> 00:07:22.550
What is important that in you brain you must get this idea that

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:26.230
“Let me be enlightened, truly." All right?
