00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:04.300
Puja Talk, India Tour. Ganapatipule (India), 6 January 1988.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:15.896
It is said that God is Satchitanand.

00:00:16.096 --> 00:00:23.081
He is truth, He is attention and He is joy.

00:00:28.685 --> 00:00:39.761
In Sahaja Yoga, first you have discovered the truth.

00:00:42.543 --> 00:00:47.510
You discovered the truth on your fingertips.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.613
The truth that you can discover

00:00:50.813 --> 00:00:55.506
on your central nervous system is the truth.

00:00:55.706 --> 00:01:00.784
First you discover the truth and you can tell about it,

00:01:00.984 --> 00:01:05.590
talk about, explain about it

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.924
but you cannot give it to others

00:01:09.124 --> 00:01:14.299
unless and until the other person gets Realization.

00:01:16.053 --> 00:01:20.013
So the truth has to be tested.

00:01:22.322 --> 00:01:31.298
One has to test on the fingertips the existence of truth.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.341
Otherwise all kinds of descriptions are of no avail.

00:01:44.547 --> 00:01:48.215
No one can understand what you are talking about

00:01:48.415 --> 00:01:52.366
when you tell them that you can feel the all pervading power

00:01:52.566 --> 00:01:56.462
of Gods' love around you.

00:02:00.437 --> 00:02:11.122
And then you start experiencing your attention.

00:02:16.887 --> 00:02:26.702
You start feeling that

00:02:26.902 --> 00:02:32.662
there is somebody, some force, some power,

00:02:32.862 --> 00:02:37.581
some organization is looking after you.

00:02:42.058 --> 00:02:50.055
Gradually you find your own attention becomes active.

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.188
Today I am happy to say that

00:02:56.388 --> 00:03:00.742
I can tell you all these things openly, so clearly.

00:03:00.942 --> 00:03:07.819
But can you believe that 20 years back even in India

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:13.477
nobody could talk about it

00:03:13.677 --> 00:03:17.226
because something Agamya, not to be known,

00:03:17.426 --> 00:03:20.178
not to be understood.

00:03:20.378 --> 00:03:25.402
Because your attention has become enlightened,

00:03:26.116 --> 00:03:30.775
with your enlightened attention you are listening to Me

00:03:30.975 --> 00:03:35.815
that's why you are understand what I am saying.

00:03:36.015 --> 00:03:40.765
You attention itself has become active now.

00:03:42.734 --> 00:03:45.734
And it baffles you sometimes when you see

00:03:46.591 --> 00:03:51.021
how many powers you have got.

00:03:51.221 --> 00:03:54.100
So through your Kundalini awakening

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:03.987
your attention has got a subtler dimension

00:04:04.187 --> 00:04:08.972
which gives you an active attention.

00:04:10.607 --> 00:04:17.091
Before this you use to play into the hands of your attention.

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:22.131
Anything happen you would turn your head to that,

00:04:22.331 --> 00:04:28.250
anything that would be called as some sort of an event

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.946
or something attractive you

00:04:32.146 --> 00:04:36.128
you would be putting your attention to that.

00:04:36.328 --> 00:04:44.182
Your attention would go to things which were controlling you as if,

00:04:44.382 --> 00:04:47.952
as if they were in charge of you.

00:04:48.152 --> 00:04:51.853
But after getting Realization

00:04:52.053 --> 00:04:57.926
your attention itself is under your own power and it
acts.

00:05:00.796 --> 00:05:07.041
First in India we had a foreign rule

00:05:07.241 --> 00:05:09.622
so we had to act according to

00:05:09.823 --> 00:05:13.650
the wish of the foreign rulers.

00:05:13.851 --> 00:05:19.064
So we thought it is better to have independence,

00:05:19.264 --> 00:05:24.409
to have our own rulers.

00:05:26.004 --> 00:05:30.534
So we achieved the freedom politically

00:05:30.734 --> 00:05:35.979
we have our own rulers who will rule us

00:05:36.179 --> 00:05:39.058
according to our own wish

00:05:39.258 --> 00:05:44.705
and we won't be enslaved by others' wishes.

00:05:46.817 --> 00:05:50.625
But this is not freedom at all

00:05:50.825 --> 00:05:55.497
because your attention is still in bondage.

00:05:56.854 --> 00:06:00.773
It has got the shackles

00:06:00.973 --> 00:06:05.421
of all kinds of nonsensical things upon it.

00:06:05.621 --> 00:06:10.978
It shifts all the time to wrong things.

00:06:12.368 --> 00:06:21.780
But after Realization attention becomes Nirmal, free,

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:26.594
Samarthiya, powerful

00:06:26.794 --> 00:06:32.118
it acts because it is completely free now.

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:34.995
Unless and until you are completely free

00:06:35.196 --> 00:06:39.636
you cannot act.

00:06:39.837 --> 00:06:43.266
This is the greatest blessing of Sahaja Yoga

00:06:43.466 --> 00:06:47.584
that your attention has become so free.

00:06:47.784 --> 00:06:56.274
It acts the way you wanted to act and it communicates.

00:06:58.686 --> 00:07:02.409
It communicates to you.

00:07:03.297 --> 00:07:08.883
The real communication starts. One
day a gentleman who are given,

00:07:09.083 --> 00:07:11.837
whom I have given Realization for the first time,

00:07:12.037 --> 00:07:15.907
he got Realization, he was the first one to get it.

00:07:16.107 --> 00:07:19.796
And he went into his congregation

00:07:19.996 --> 00:07:23.558
where he felt that there is somebody else who is a Realized soul.

00:07:23.758 --> 00:07:27.419
So he looked around and he saw a lady sitting there

00:07:27.619 --> 00:07:31.889
who had Realization. He came and asked Me, Mother

00:07:32.105 --> 00:07:36.846
did you give Realization to such and such lady. I said I did.

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:43.352
So this communication between the reality and yourself

00:07:43.552 --> 00:07:46.051
is established through attention

00:07:46.251 --> 00:07:51.933
because in the attention now there is freedom to know.

00:07:52.848 --> 00:07:54.902
But in the attention now

00:07:55.102 --> 00:07:58.735
we have to see that there are so many other things

00:07:58.935 --> 00:08:06.686
which have clouded the awareness of the attention.

00:08:07.726 --> 00:08:15.518
This cloudedness comes with our conditioning and our ego.

00:08:16.526 --> 00:08:20.151
And this conditioning can be very, very strong.

00:08:20.351 --> 00:08:24.239
I would say in India, we are over conditioned people

00:08:24.439 --> 00:08:27.407
because we are traditionally made.

00:08:27.608 --> 00:08:30.366
And we do not see what is good in tradition

00:08:30.566 --> 00:08:33.895
and what is bad in tradition. Whatever good we have to keep

00:08:34.095 --> 00:08:36.109
and whatever bad we have to throw away.

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:45.464
Whatever is the tradition is the
best is absolutely a wrong idea.

00:08:47.695 --> 00:08:51.728
So such an attention which is so much bogged

00:08:51.928 --> 00:08:57.007
or you can say completely covered with conditioning

00:08:57.207 --> 00:09:02.001
can not communicate with reality.

00:09:06.008 --> 00:09:13.671
Though reality is anxious to communicate and to say

00:09:13.871 --> 00:09:22.161
or to inform whatever is desires of the Divine

00:09:22.362 --> 00:09:28.419
but, as we are so much loaded with our conditioning

00:09:28.619 --> 00:09:33.016
that it can not communicate.

00:09:33.635 --> 00:09:35.755
You are frightened of the society,

00:09:35.955 --> 00:09:38.040
you are frightened of the surroundings,

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.669
frightened of our relations, who are no more our relations

00:09:40.869 --> 00:09:42.967
at all, nothing to do with because they have

00:09:43.167 --> 00:09:46.252
no communication with the reality.

00:09:46.452 --> 00:09:49.706
We are the ones who have got now

00:09:49.907 --> 00:09:53.997
communication with reality.

00:09:54.198 --> 00:09:56.952
When the ego part, our futuristic ideas w

00:09:57.153 --> 00:09:59.535
e want to develop this, we want to do that

00:09:59.535 --> 00:10:03.277
we want to achieve this.

00:10:05.792 --> 00:10:10.306
That also dulls our attention

00:10:10.506 --> 00:10:17.405
and puts it into the shackles of ego
which are even worse I would say.

00:10:17.605 --> 00:10:21.097
At least the first one...

00:11:12.195 --> 00:11:17.520
Some children have beautiful attention and some don't have.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:20.568
I would not always blame the parents but of course partly

00:11:20.768 --> 00:11:22.768
they are responsible.

00:11:22.969 --> 00:11:24.969
At this stage if their attention is not good,

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:28.313
at what age they are going to improve? Parents pamper them,

00:11:28.513 --> 00:11:33.156
spoil them then the children cant' have good attention.

00:11:36.027 --> 00:11:40.096
Those who are half hearted Sahaja Yogis

00:11:40.296 --> 00:11:45.623
are still sitting on the edges.

00:11:47.036 --> 00:11:52.782
And can be anytime brought into the sea of illusion.

00:11:53.949 --> 00:11:58.331
You have to be perfect Sahaja Yogis.

00:11:59.903 --> 00:12:03.631
Some people find it easy, escape it by saying that

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:07.520
such and such person is much better than me.

00:12:07.721 --> 00:12:10.815
And then too sat back and saying that "oh, I am not good".

00:12:11.015 --> 00:12:14.602
So you better get out.

00:12:18.369 --> 00:12:25.152
Here the Divine needs the people who will do the job of the Divine.

00:12:27.516 --> 00:12:29.722
But even if you ask them to get out

00:12:29.923 --> 00:12:33.794
they'll stick on and stick on and stick on.

00:12:33.995 --> 00:12:37.858
It's not going to help them because they think it is blissful,

00:12:38.058 --> 00:12:42.948
may be some of them think that they
can have some material advantage.

00:12:43.148 --> 00:12:48.100
Some of them think they can get some presents in Ganapatipulle.

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:53.992
Very low grade understanding.

00:12:56.540 --> 00:13:02.795
So such people are bothering us and are good for nothing.

00:13:02.995 --> 00:13:08.575
The first and foremost thing is to clear your heart.

00:13:09.614 --> 00:13:14.195
I have seen that the relationships

00:13:14.395 --> 00:13:20.284
is the greatest curse on Indians.

00:13:21.241 --> 00:13:28.439
And the second is the caste system.

00:13:29.781 --> 00:13:36.920
I know of a lady who is absolutely no good for Sahaja Yog

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:41.003
but her sisters are supporting her.

00:13:41.203 --> 00:13:43.592
I know all that and as a result

00:13:43.793 --> 00:13:46.176
they are losing themselves in Sahaja Yoga

00:13:46.377 --> 00:13:50.687
and the brother in law has become suddenly hot tempered.

00:13:50.888 --> 00:13:53.101
But if I tell them they won't listen

00:13:53.301 --> 00:13:55.674
till they are completely finished, all of them

00:13:55.674 --> 00:13:59.460
this lady will stick on.

00:14:01.643 --> 00:14:04.633
Unless and until this lady clears her heart

00:14:04.833 --> 00:14:10.583
she should not come to Sahaja Yoga and oblige all the relations.

00:14:11.519 --> 00:14:15.391
This kind of low graded understanding of Sahaja Yoga

00:14:15.591 --> 00:14:23.535
will lead you no where and how many of
you are going to drop out I don't know.

00:14:28.369 --> 00:14:30.498
You wouldn't even know when you are catching

00:14:30.698 --> 00:14:35.571
and what's happening if you keep to these relationships.

00:14:36.746 --> 00:14:40.510
Another, is another myth of a caste system in this country,

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:43.526
which is the greatest cancer, you could think of,

00:14:43.726 --> 00:14:47.845
for such a Divine country like this.

00:14:49.036 --> 00:14:53.598
It's the greatest curse

00:14:53.798 --> 00:14:57.146
but in the West we have another curses

00:14:57.346 --> 00:15:01.195
though you have got rid of all these past thing

00:15:01.395 --> 00:15:04.798
you have modern curses.

00:15:04.998 --> 00:15:08.330
And the modern curses are even worse in a way

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:11.308
because they are not troublesome at all.

00:15:11.508 --> 00:15:16.155
On the contrary they show as if

00:15:16.355 --> 00:15:21.614
you are on top of the world that you are very successful.

00:15:25.297 --> 00:15:31.849
In the modern curses the thing is the attitude "what's wrong?".

00:15:34.905 --> 00:15:41.643
They linger on this idea to great extent,

00:15:41.843 --> 00:15:44.746
"what's wrong?".

00:15:44.946 --> 00:15:48.955
You have to be selfish about it.

00:15:49.155 --> 00:15:53.241
You have to think about yourself

00:15:53.441 --> 00:15:57.392
and not about others and about your society,

00:15:57.592 --> 00:16:06.961
about your development, you're so-called industrial revolution.

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:09.601
It has already cursed you.

00:16:09.801 --> 00:16:11.888
Industrial revolution has already cursed you.

00:16:12.088 --> 00:16:15.457
You are eating the food from tins.

00:16:15.657 --> 00:16:20.213
You are having hybrid animals to give you milk,

00:16:20.413 --> 00:16:24.762
tomorrow you will have mothers who are hybrid.

00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:31.671
You are having divorces, you are having drugs,

00:16:31.871 --> 00:16:35.600
all kinds of things that are curse on human beings

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:40.903
are worked out through this modern conditioning in you.

00:16:44.491 --> 00:16:47.235
To make this attention clean

00:16:47.435 --> 00:16:52.153
should be the only effort of a Sahaja Yogi.

00:16:52.354 --> 00:16:54.406
Sahaja Yogi is not a pass time,

00:16:54.607 --> 00:16:56.771
for many it's is just a pass time.

00:16:56.972 --> 00:16:59.487
Their jobs, their businesses is most important.

00:16:59.687 --> 00:17:02.820
Sahaja Yoga is just a pass time.

00:17:03.021 --> 00:17:06.858
They are all right for a time being. How long will they go on?

00:17:07.058 --> 00:17:09.763
I can't say.

00:17:09.963 --> 00:17:15.703
So clear your attention first then everything is going to work out.

00:17:15.903 --> 00:17:18.894
But see that in your attention you pay importance to things,

00:17:19.094 --> 00:17:22.946
which are no important at all.

00:17:24.492 --> 00:17:30.474
In this respect I would say you have to be individual,

00:17:30.676 --> 00:17:33.202
to know that your attention has to be clean.

00:17:33.402 --> 00:17:37.334
Where is my attention going?

00:17:38.858 --> 00:17:45.279
Clubbing is the worst curse that
we have in Western Countries.

00:17:45.479 --> 00:17:48.400
They will club under any name. Supposing

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:53.479
there is a red hair people, they will form a red hair league.

00:17:59.716 --> 00:18:02.597
In that way I would say

00:18:02.597 --> 00:18:05.624
people are least individualistic.

00:18:05.825 --> 00:18:08.202
Whatever they may say that they are democratic

00:18:08.402 --> 00:18:11.361
I would say they are least individualistic.

00:18:11.561 --> 00:18:17.611
If a lady starts a kind of a hairstyle

00:18:17.811 --> 00:18:22.842
all the ladies do the same, just like donkeys.

00:18:23.483 --> 00:18:26.308
If the men do not put oil in their hair

00:18:26.509 --> 00:18:29.363
all the men will not put oil in theirs'.

00:18:29.563 --> 00:18:32.047
I don't know what looks nice without the... dishevelled hair

00:18:32.254 --> 00:18:34.887
I just don't understand. That's the fashion now,

00:18:35.087 --> 00:18:38.874
nobody will put any oil in their hair.

00:18:39.075 --> 00:18:43.150
Even if you can wash it off they will not put it.

00:18:44.706 --> 00:18:50.612
This is such a simple thing

00:18:50.812 --> 00:18:55.510
that you need oil for your hair.

00:18:57.590 --> 00:19:05.325
But all these modern ideas are anti life.

00:19:12.592 --> 00:19:17.186
They are teaching you something which will make you bald.

00:19:17.386 --> 00:19:22.285
Sometimes you lose your ears or nose or whatever it is.

00:19:23.285 --> 00:19:25.942
To put that in the ears all the time and

00:19:26.142 --> 00:19:29.797
listen to that music all the time and going on the streets,

00:19:29.997 --> 00:19:35.916
on those wheels, I mean it's really madness I think,

00:19:36.116 --> 00:19:39.688
stupidity, absolutely.

00:19:39.888 --> 00:19:44.174
But regarded as something very modern.

00:19:44.801 --> 00:19:48.173
It's all anti life activities going on.

00:19:48.373 --> 00:19:55.069
Putting color on the hair, red, yellow, green,

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:58.734
wearing no clothes when it's so very cold,

00:19:58.934 --> 00:20:05.090
sitting in the sun burning your skin,

00:20:07.145 --> 00:20:14.153
to behave indecently, decorously, that is to be modern.

00:20:14.353 --> 00:20:17.383
"What's wrong?"

00:20:17.583 --> 00:20:23.681
Nothing is wrong, just to go to hell, that's all.

00:20:23.881 --> 00:20:29.347
If that means nothing, take two running jumps and go there

00:20:29.547 --> 00:20:33.849
but leave Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:36.269 --> 00:20:39.781
Now the attention has to be cleared in a way that we meditate

00:20:39.781 --> 00:20:42.783
within ourselves and just go within yourself,

00:20:42.983 --> 00:20:46.396
but see yourself what you are,

00:20:46.596 --> 00:20:52.596
how beautiful you are, how glorious you are, how subtle you are.

00:20:55.651 --> 00:20:58.957
But in stupid things they are individualistic,

00:20:59.157 --> 00:21:03.155
like "this is my carpet and this is my house,

00:21:03.355 --> 00:21:07.172
this is my furniture."

00:21:07.373 --> 00:21:10.393
And they control others with that "this is my furniture,

00:21:10.593 --> 00:21:16.728
don't sit on that chair. Don't spoil my carpet".

00:21:17.204 --> 00:21:24.091
When you will die you won't be
buried with the carpet even.

00:21:28.393 --> 00:21:33.106
Like in Egypt Pharaohs were buried with all their things you see.

00:21:33.306 --> 00:21:36.249
It is not possible these days because you don't have so much place

00:21:36.249 --> 00:21:39.981
to bury.

00:21:40.877 --> 00:21:42.923
So sticking on to nonsensical things

00:21:43.123 --> 00:21:48.169
and the important things not paying attention

00:21:48.369 --> 00:21:51.629
is an absolutely abuse of your attention

00:21:51.829 --> 00:21:54.486
and this has been achieved

00:21:54.686 --> 00:22:00.404
through your so called modern idea of individualism.

00:22:02.372 --> 00:22:09.602
There is no integration of understanding

00:22:09.802 --> 00:22:17.675
and the whole thing is breaking into pieces.

00:22:20.145 --> 00:22:26.754
Between these two horrible extremes

00:22:26.954 --> 00:22:33.111
I have dared to start Sahaja Yoga,

00:22:33.311 --> 00:22:37.692
to collect you all there in the center.

00:22:39.414 --> 00:22:42.414
How?

00:22:43.471 --> 00:22:47.749
With very intense love.

00:22:50.511 --> 00:22:55.929
With very intense effort

00:22:56.129 --> 00:23:02.534
and a complete commitment that I am going to save this world.

00:23:11.559 --> 00:23:14.353
It has worked so well now,

00:23:14.553 --> 00:23:23.632
I can see you all get into the third stage of joy.

00:23:25.982 --> 00:23:31.401
And the joy is what I want you to have

00:23:31.601 --> 00:23:38.327
and not self-destruction or stupid conditioning pressures.

00:23:38.527 --> 00:23:41.263
Joy

00:23:41.463 --> 00:23:47.719
and joy has no double meaning it's absolute.

00:23:49.942 --> 00:23:53.249
You reach to that subtlety that you start enjoying

00:23:53.449 --> 00:23:59.241
the tasting of joy, not vibration but joy,

00:24:01.471 --> 00:24:04.668
beyond your central nervous system

00:24:04.868 --> 00:24:09.353
where it can not be expressed in words.

00:24:10.512 --> 00:24:15.810
It expresses in your eyes, in your faces, in the atmosphere,

00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:19.787
in the nature, everywhere

00:24:19.987 --> 00:24:24.701
to see the whole thing is blossoming around.

00:24:26.093 --> 00:24:29.718
This is what you all have to achieve

00:24:29.918 --> 00:24:34.916
and for that we have to know

00:24:35.116 --> 00:24:40.930
that we are not going to bow down to anything

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:46.146
that puts our attention into shackles.

00:24:46.617 --> 00:24:52.020
"Mother has freed us, let us spread our wings."

00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:55.527
"We are not little, small little birdies

00:24:55.727 --> 00:24:58.893
but now we have become birds

00:24:59.093 --> 00:25:08.222
and let us spread our wings and fly in the sky of joy".

00:25:13.881 --> 00:25:18.078
There is no need for birds to fly.

00:25:18.752 --> 00:25:21.457
They can sit at a place,

00:25:21.657 --> 00:25:25.370
of course, they cannot hire a bus,

00:25:25.570 --> 00:25:29.340
but they need not.

00:25:32.793 --> 00:25:39.053
They spread their wings and fly because they enjoy it,

00:25:39.253 --> 00:25:46.991
like swimming in the sky of joy.

00:25:49.538 --> 00:25:55.926
So use the beauty of this joyous happening

00:25:56.126 --> 00:25:58.379
to nourish yourself,

00:25:58.579 --> 00:26:01.085
be happy,

00:26:01.285 --> 00:26:08.286
make everyone happy and emancipate this world from ignorance.

00:26:08.487 --> 00:26:11.826
May God bless you all.
