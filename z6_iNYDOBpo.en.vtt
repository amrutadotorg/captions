00:00:00.000 --> 00:02:04.280
[UNCLEAR]

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.500
Yogi: Mother, [UNCLEAR] with the Italians.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.600
What are your [UNCLEAR]? Even before realization,

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.340
I have a feeling that during this whole programme

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.340
there was certain attitude of respect.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.260
Maybe two or three are useless but the group.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.480
There was a kind of respect and they say, "Madre" and you know.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.540
this kind of right attitude right away.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:46.280
Yogi: Well, this is the place where the virgin Mary is most respected in the whole of Christian [UNCLEAR]

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.200
This is the place where [UNCLEAR] and [UNCLEAR] were.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.780
Mataji: They may not [UNCLEAR] the church. Right?

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.780
There were [UNCLEAR]

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.200
Yogi: That was the illusion of the church, much better than the Swiss.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.800
They, they have lost their illusions of the church much better than the Swiss.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.340
Mataji: They are [UNCLEAR] better.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.020
And nobody objected.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.740
Nobody objected.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:48.400
Yogi: And I was so amazed, they were so enamored by raising the kundalini Mother.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.160
Mother, they were so happy to raise the kundalini, it was amazing.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.500
Mataji: I would say it was a very good achievement.

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.480
In India, [UNCLEAR]

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.400
they know how to respect the Goddess.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:39.500
In India, [UNCLEAR] no once can [UNCLEAR] Mother.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.500
[UNCLEAR] to say even.

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.100
very remarkable.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:58.920
They [UNCLEAR] that to say something will not [UNCLEAR]

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:14.180
In India, [UNCLEAR] listen [UNCLEAR] where [UNCLEAR] No Mother,

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.400
[UNCLEAR] because

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.280
their sense of protocol is very clean.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:38.020
Yogi: Therefore Mother, it is so important for us to go to India because we learn so much from them.

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:47.040
Yogi: Mother, if some people want to come to India, what do I tell them?

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:53.840
Yogi: If some people want to come to India, what do I tell them?

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.840
What about organization? How

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:01.880
Mataji: There have to be [UNCLEAR] three weeks.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:09.920
Mataji: From, we start from Bombay we go to [Vaitarna?]

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:13.000
From there we are going to [UNCLEAR] and all those places.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
So now will be one week.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.880
An soon it will be [UNCLEAR]

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.960
Yogi: Who should I contact Modi? Who has information?

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.900
[UNCLEAR] I am going to [write?UNCLEAR]

00:07:54.840 --> 00:08:00.860
Mataji: Bombay to Pune only this time we are going to organize. We are not going to [UNCLEAR], only

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:09.220
Mataji: 18th, they are all [UNCLEAR] there.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.240
Mataji: We are having weekly programs you see.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:29.180
Yogi: Why will they stay in Bombay? Mataji: Not in Bombay.

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:35.400
Mataji: This time they are going to stay near Bombay, there is a place called Vaitarna.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.400
Mataji: Its [UNCLEAR]

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:44.300
There are some guest houses, [UNCLEAR], so we will privately go there.

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:24.080
Yogi: I think the heart is more opening this [timeframe?]

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:29.440
It's more open than in Switzerland, than in UK also.

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:39.060
Mataji: They are simpler people.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
In UK, people think that they are very clever.

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:16.380
I think the ego is not overdeveloped here.

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:23.480
Yogi: It is Mother but something Spiritual, I mean,

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:32.200
[UNCLEAR] Portuguese, Spanish are not also not so bad.

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.560
Ego is not so over developed.

00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:03.420
Yogi: I have explained a bit to Ruth [UNCLEAR] came back from

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:05.420
the meeting

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:10.100
how it was in this Swiss German part of Switzerland.

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:12.660
And you came for the third time.

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:16.720
Unbelievable.

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:27.340
Mataji: So did you [UNCLEAR] word I said?

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:37.740
Yogi: These girls call you Goodbye 
Mother. I love you, I mean,  nobody [like I know UNCLEAR]

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:12.800
Mataji:  [UNCLEAR] are the [UNCLEAR]

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:27.200
Yogi: Remember Mr. [UNCLEAR]?

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:31.520
I give him my poster like this one to him.

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:38.140
[UNCLEAR] the [UNCLEAR] of program down. But meditate [Christian UNCLEAR] fellow.

00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:59.380
Mataji: All the souls are there, very [UNCLEAR]

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:29.200
Yogi: Mother, it's my prayer that

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:31.400
my sister and brother will bring

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:36.380
some of Mediterranean Italian art.

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:38.380
Let's hope.

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:03.720
Sahaja yoga is very good.

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:22.700
[UNCLEAR] this is the problem.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.480
They don't talk.

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.560
Just keep quiet, that's all.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.420
But, now the protocol [is going to change UNCLEAR]

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:29.020
For me, [UNCLEAR] was such a problem.

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:47.580
Yogi: In India too, Mother, I know, in India.

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:55.280
Matai: But in America, to come all the way, to there, to see [UNCLEAR] it was very [bad? UNCLEAR]

00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:01.900
Mataji: She said, as soon as you start your lecture

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:03.920
they go out, you see.

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:27.560
Mataji: You sit here like a Sahaja yogini [UNCLEAR]

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:48.900
Yogi: I remember

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:51.300
It was in Pune.

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:53.380
Big all.

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:56.140
And the newcomers were in the middle and

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:58.120
sahaja yogis were around.

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:02.380
And so we were facing each other during the meeting.

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:07.320
And suddenly, I was just in front of Pamela and

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:10.820
[UNCLEAR]

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:32.240
Yogi: I don't know but

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.480
the wedding

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:42.400
at some point I spoke very loud, so that you should not shout.

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:46.640
Remember, when there was the sixteen petalled wedding?

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:50.160
And [UNCLEAR] was sitting near her

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:53.280
and she started speaking about me.

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:56.240
Saying, for who does he think

00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:00.000
look how he shout?

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
Yogi: What did she say?

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.680
Yogi: That I was gross to shout like this.

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:11.040
and things like that,  I don't know why she mind.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:16.500
Mataji: She must have been disturbed [UNCLEAR]

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:17.280
Yogi: Sometimes your answers are so sharp Mother.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.160
Chile people, really Mother?

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:44.280
Mataji: They are from Chile, yes.

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:50.320
[UNCLEAR] things started operating.

00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:00.460
Some Chilean family was there.

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:04.200
And from there, they shifted to

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:06.040
[UNCLEAR]

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:26.580
Mataji: Today they were telling me about [UNCLEAR] Chile people [UNCLEAR]

00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:28.160
I know them.

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:33.360
[UNCLEAR]

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:38.760
They are very innocent people.

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:44.040
[UNCLEAR] so many people from Chile. [UNCLEAR]

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:49.200
So nobody knows [as to UNCLEAR] how many people were [killed?]

00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:52.260
[UNCLEAR] people.

00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:09.200
[UNCLEAR]

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.160
Actually, [UNCLEAR]

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:21.800
wife was to be [UNCLEAR]

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:29.120
[UNCLEAR]

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:44.600
[UNCLEAR] ladies also came at the [UNCLEAR]

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:53.180
China, [UNCLEAR]

00:25:58.940 --> 00:25:59.940
Bandernaike

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:02.560
[UNCLEAR] in Israel.

00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:09.460
I mean the funny characters.

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:11.680
Yogi: He was quite funny.

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:17.260
Even I think.

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:19.700
Czechoslovakia [UNCLEAR] .

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:21.660
You know Czechoslavakia.

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:24.920
[UNCLEAR] 's wife

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:53.560
Mataji: Kennedy's wife.

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:10.680
[UNCLEAR] 's wife?

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:15.360
Mataji: I sent this [UNCLEAR]  such a nice big thing.

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:17.900
of Shiva and Parvati.

00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:20.060
You have seen that.

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:21.680
in my house.

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:23.680
Statue of Shiva and Parvati.

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:25.600
of [UNCLEAR]

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:28.620
That's what C.P wanted me to give him.

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:30.720
I sent it over.

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:50.360
[UNCLEAR]  is [coming?] to America next [UNCLEAR] ?

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:27.980
But Russian people are very good for realization.

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:32.600
[UNCLEAR]

00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:39.640
Russian people.

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:40.760
Very good.

00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:42.140
Very nice.

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:48.160
[UNCLEAR]

00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:52.660
I went there.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.120
With my husband.

00:29:57.700 --> 00:29:59.080
[UNCLEAR]

00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:16.940
Yogi: It is very sad that in the West we identify the Russians with the Government.

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:18.580
so [UNCLEAR]

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:21.160
Good people, very good people.

00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:23.220
[UNCLEAR]  simple [UNCLEAR]

00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:26.460
They have something [UNCLEAR] make in the church.

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:35.060
The kind of the freedom you have also

00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:36.920
[UNCLEAR]

00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:42.620
Even in this freedom, there is so much of [UNCLEAR]

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:48.420
In our freedom, now, in Switzerland,

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:50.920
Such a lot of hierarchy is there.

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:56.440
Hierarchy.

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:00.160
Isn't it?

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:01.800
So much of Hierarchy.

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:08.060
some five six families are controlling [the whole show UNCLEAR]  you see.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.280
Money, this, that.

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:17.660
So, actually, man is not to be to understand evil.

00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:24.340
And most things are [UNCLEAR]

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:26.540
The wait has gone just [asking UNCLEAR]  for God.

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:32.760
You know, worst, was, when I reached there that day

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:37.100
A man was crossing at the road.

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:39.100
Another was going [UNCLEAR]

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:44.040
And the man was crossing the road as he was a little late or whatever it was.

00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:47.540
The man in the car said something [UNCLEAR]  him

00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:49.640
Immediately he turned back some words.

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:51.940
The man in the car took out his pistol and [UNCLEAR]

00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:55.660
Yogi: When? Where?

00:31:57.180 --> 00:31:58.300
Very violently.

00:31:58.440 --> 00:31:59.820
Yogi: You saw that Mother?

00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:02.360
No, no it was there in the newspaper.

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:07.200
Just about two streets away from where I was.

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:12.340
Yogi: And Mother, I tell you, we went to Miami.

00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:15.460
with Maria and now they cannot go

00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:18.000
out during the night because they are so

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:19.280
many crimes.

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:24.320
And it went up with all of these refugees from

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:26.300
South America, you know, now.

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:29.280
All the refugees of South America have

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:32.700
settled down in this part of the United States.

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:36.440
And criminality is so horrible.

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:38.780
Mataji: They are very hot tempered people.

00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:40.060
The trouble is so.

00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:42.180
Nodody is safe today.

00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:44.800
Anybody can [UNCLEAR]  this boy Michael

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:48.140
who came to us, [UNCLEAR]  so fed up.

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:49.960
with life. If you have

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:51.960
had not met me I would have just committed suicide.

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:53.520
I said, What happened? He said, His first cousin

00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:55.420
killed his own mother.

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:56.800
in the [UNCLEAR]

00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:58.560
[UNCLEAR]

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:01.160
[UNCLEAR]

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:09.600
Yogi: With 18?

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:10.900
Mataji: Eighteen, 1 8.

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:31.340
Mataji: So what is the [use UNCLEAR] of having so much freedom?

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:32.360
to become like this?

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:35.840
abandoned [UNCLEAR], you see, it's going too far.

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:40.400
Russians, are you see, they are underdeveloped even.

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:45.200
[UNCLEAR]

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:52.500
Both views are not good, but

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.400
to give freedom also, this happens.

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:57.840
If you don't give freedom that happens.

00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:00.300
which [UNCLEAR]  to [UNCLEAR] ?

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:04.680
Yogi: But, the Russian will have to come

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:08.160
to the stage of America, in order to get the

00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:10.120
[UNCLEAR]  of the seeker.

00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:12.620
Mataji: They are seeking all right.

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:15.920
I talked to [UNCLEAR]

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:18.420
They sad, they have got everything.

00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:20.460
But it's not satisfying.

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:24.960
There must be something in [New York?].

00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:28.240
There is a direct [UNCLEAR] ?

00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:37.980
Very surprising, isn't it?

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:42.240
In Russia, as she told me.

00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:52.060
Of course America should come much faster.

00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:00.860
But the idea we got about Russia,

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:05.320
which is not so horrid.

00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:07.540
They cannot get realization?

00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:14.540
I have [UNCLEAR]  intimacy from

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.400
Yogi: About the things to Florence.

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:40.200
Thomas, because he felt so good with us, he want to go Germany today.

00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:45.500
So tomorrow, there is a ... Thomas

00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:47.660
could come to Florance but

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:50.360
[UNCLEAR]  too, so there are too many

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:52.740
people and I

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:56.720
asked if it would be possible

00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:00.160
to take 2 cars

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:09.220
or is it expensive to hire cars for one day?

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:14.360
Mataji: Or what about the, we can go by train?

00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:20.780
We can go by train and meet at a certain point.

00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:40.640
[Discussion about cars renting]

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:43.320
Yogi: Ok, I don't want to be negative Mother, but

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:45.080
to hire a car

00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:49.540
on time, because

00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:50.920
it's a three hour and a half drive.

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:52.780
So we have to start early tomorrow morning.

00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:54.520
Mataji: We can just go by train.

00:36:56.300 --> 00:37:00.540
Yogi: So we have to come back tomorrow evening, so all together.

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:21.440
[trains discussion]

00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:07.780
Yogi: Yes, but to see Florence with you Mother, it is to see Florence for the first time.

00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:25.780
Mataji: We can get a bus or something.

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:31.280
Mataji: It's a small place or big place?

00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:38.420
Yogi:  Well, Florence, I think the [UNCLEAR] one can walk really

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:45.260
No no, it's a bit too much.

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:55.160
Yogi: There is another solution, it is that we take

00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:57.460
2 cars from here.

00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:05.060
Yogi: No because someone is [UNCLEAR] that car.

00:39:07.400 --> 00:40:14.540
[Discussions about cars]

00:40:55.780 --> 00:41:02.960
Yogi: It is such a small country but [UNCLEAR] on your attention Mother.

00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:11.220
But once you should come and see our

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:12.860
big mountains Mother.

00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:17.820
Mataji: Yes I'm sure sometime I will have to come and see.

00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:21.540
Mataji: That's what I said, if I don't do Florence now I will never do it.

00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:24.520
Because, three times I have been here

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:28.440
Yogi: It's such a beautiful place mother.

00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:34.240
Yogi: So, let's just do it. So, tomorrow in my car

00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:37.160
there will be [UNCLEAR], you

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:44.160
and then

00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:47.560
Yogi: I can take 3 people.

00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:14.620
Yogi: You decide Mother because it's a headache.

00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:16.680
Mataji: How many are coming?

00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:33.820
Yogi: Someone will have to go by train and we can meet at some place.

00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:36.600
Yogi: Do you know where exactly?

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:38.400
Yogi: Where and When.

00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:42.980
Mataji: We can meet at the station.

00:42:42.980 --> 00:43:15.900
[Discussion about where to meet]

00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:26.220
Mataji: She is saying that here the [Cathedral ? UNCLEAR] is easier.

00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:28.640
Station is rather complicated.

00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:32.500
Mataji: What time we will meet there [UNCLEAR]?

00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:34.280
We meet at the earliest.

00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:36.240
[UNCLEAR]

00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:38.600
Mataji: Oh, I can go very early. [UNCLEAR]

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.160
Mataji: It's just the [UNCLEAR]

00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:52.360
Yogi: You are going to say the time Mother.

00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:53.360
Mataji: 4 o'clock?

00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:58.800
Yogi: I mean there can be an accident, can't it?

00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:01.000
Mataji: What accident?

00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:05.340
Yogi: Well, the driver falling asleep.

00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:10.460
Mataji: [UNCLEAR] from 4 o'clock on wards [UNCLEAR]
