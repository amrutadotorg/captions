WEBVTT

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:16.260
I am very, very happy to see so many of you
coming down here for the program.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:23.379
Actually, I bought this land at least, at
least twenty-five years back.

00:00:23.379 --> 00:00:31.810
I couldn’t do anything about it as they
had lots of objections, this and that, but

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:40.000
then somehow, I planned the whole thing and
it all worked out.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:49.280
Happy to see you all here but with all those
difficulties ultimately now you find so many

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.439
Sahaja yogis attending this program, My puja.

00:00:54.439 --> 00:01:09.290
I must remember My brother Baba who has worked
very hard for the propagation of Indian music,

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:16.990
classical music, all types of art, whatever
he could do.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:23.250
It’s a very sad thing that he is not here
today to see you all.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:37.119
He has done so much work religiously without
expecting any reward whatsoever and I wish

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:46.890
you could have him as your ideal and that
will work it out everything in that way.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:56.160
There’s one thing about him I know, he never
tried to show off anything.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:09.190
He was very intelligent, educated man but
he caught hold of all the people of ordinary

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:21.489
living and he looked after them and he promoted
their skill of music and art.

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:40.480
With the same idea, I decided to have this
place dedicated to his idea of propagating

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:49.490
music and art and I am happy to see that that
idea has materialized.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:50.530
But I wish [UNCLEAR.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:58.480
EITHER had or that] My brother was here to
make you feel very happy about it.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.830
He was a very loving and a kind person.

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.270
Never used to get angry with anyone, I’ve
seen that.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:14.390
But always he gave Me a very good picture
of every person.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:22.569
You can’t help it.

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:22.916
What are they saying?

00:03:33.254 --> 00:03:36.499
Who is it?

00:03:38.708 --> 00:03:41.786
What happened?

00:03:44.504 --> 00:03:48.067
SY: Volunteers just see who is there.

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.425
SM: They are speaking in Marathi.

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:17.693
They are asking where to sit? Nothing else.

00:04:17.894 --> 00:04:18.984
What is it?

00:04:19.183 --> 00:04:23.427
They are saying there is no place. They have to sit on ground.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.700
SM: It is the specialty of Maharashtra: quarrelsome nature.

00:04:37.837 --> 00:04:41.306
They are very good at fighting.

00:04:41.507 --> 00:04:46.444
Do anything for them but nothing enters into their head.

00:04:47.961 --> 00:04:52.418
They have no understanding,

00:04:52.619 --> 00:04:55.042
always ready to fight,

00:04:55.243 --> 00:04:57.647
even with swords.

00:04:59.093 --> 00:05:05.509
I am fed up with your quarrelling nature.

00:05:05.782 --> 00:05:11.084
This beautiful new building has been erected

00:05:11.507 --> 00:05:13.289
for our classical music.

00:05:13.472 --> 00:05:15.971
They fought even on this

00:05:16.172 --> 00:05:22.383
and many times I felt, why build it in Maharashtra?

00:05:22.851 --> 00:05:27.118
No point doing anything for these quarreling people.

00:05:28.373 --> 00:05:31.912
They fight for some reason or the other.

00:05:32.547 --> 00:05:35.760
They have no shame, nothing.

00:05:36.976 --> 00:05:43.390
If they don’t find a place to sit, what can we do?

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.076
No maturity at all.

00:05:52.458 --> 00:05:58.251
I don’t know how there is music in these quarrelsome people.

00:05:58.452 --> 00:06:01.643
And the music has grown so much.

00:06:04.587 --> 00:06:07.167
Everybody has the same experience.

00:06:07.342 --> 00:06:11.615
In Maharashtra people are very quarrelsome

00:06:13.085 --> 00:06:16.076
and I am fed up with it.

00:06:16.934 --> 00:06:20.381
Everybody is complaining about something.

00:06:20.614 --> 00:06:24.246
Have you not found peace in Sahaja Yoga?

00:06:24.447 --> 00:06:28.924
So many Great Saints & Sages were born in this land

00:06:29.115 --> 00:06:33.543
and they have given so much knowledge.

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:39.387
They have given so much knowledge but there is no effect.

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.252
This quarrelsome nature is not going.

00:06:42.453 --> 00:06:46.072
They will fight even in their name,

00:06:47.183 --> 00:06:50.250
keep behaving foolishly.

00:06:50.459 --> 00:06:55.879
I don’t know when this foolishness is going to end in Maharashtra.

00:06:59.677 --> 00:07:02.970
They just don’t understand peaceful living

00:07:03.161 --> 00:07:08.927
and absorbing everything peacefully.

00:07:10.904 --> 00:07:14.870
They just start shouting all of a sudden.

00:07:17.232 --> 00:07:20.366
Our foreign Sahaja Yogis say:

00:07:20.626 --> 00:07:22.842
"Are they uneducated people?".

00:07:23.033 --> 00:07:26.565
No, no, they are very well educated,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.906
but very quarrelsome.

00:07:31.175 --> 00:07:34.452
And why they fight, they only know.

00:07:37.475 --> 00:07:41.935
At least please don’t fight in Sahaja yoga

00:07:44.152 --> 00:07:46.993
and be a bit peaceful.

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:49.510
At least try.

00:07:49.977 --> 00:07:52.771
We want to change, isn’t it?

00:07:53.747 --> 00:07:57.564
Instead of finding faults with others,

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:01.805
see what is wrong with yourself.

00:08:02.813 --> 00:08:08.116
Baba has done a lot of work in this mad Maharashtra,

00:08:08.459 --> 00:08:10.823
at Nagpur.

00:08:11.006 --> 00:08:15.813
There are different type of people in Nagpur,

00:08:16.306 --> 00:08:22.442
I want to say there are not only Maharashtrians.

00:08:22.908 --> 00:08:26.955
People in Nagpur are very active and they helped him.

00:08:27.732 --> 00:08:35.723
But nobody understands that you must absorb Sahaja yoga

00:08:35.924 --> 00:08:38.408
and become a Saint (Sadhu).

00:08:38.607 --> 00:08:42.218
That doesn't come in anyone's attention.

00:08:43.099 --> 00:08:45.217
When you think of just making money somehow,

00:08:45.456 --> 00:08:48.686
run helter-skelter for it,

00:08:51.668 --> 00:08:59.421
have such a low manner thinking,

00:09:00.199 --> 00:09:05.181
with such a thinking, how can you be a Sahaja Yogi?

00:09:07.895 --> 00:09:10.928
What should we call them?

00:09:11.254 --> 00:09:14.698
One must feel that: ”I am a realized soul.

00:09:14.905 --> 00:09:16.513
We must achieve some good state”.

00:09:16.714 --> 00:09:20.316
Mother has worked so hard and so much for us.

00:09:20.517 --> 00:09:24.726
So [all of you] decide today

00:09:24.949 --> 00:09:28.785
to stop fighting from now onwards

00:09:30.394 --> 00:09:34.579
and stop being greedy for money,

00:09:34.791 --> 00:09:37.392
which is too much in Maharashtra.

00:09:37.593 --> 00:09:41.154
Here greed for money is amazing.

00:09:42.291 --> 00:09:47.041
Because of greed for money it is difficult to do Sahaja Yoga in Maharashtra.

00:09:47.248 --> 00:09:54.411
I have worked a lot in Maharashtra, beyond the words,

00:09:54.612 --> 00:09:58.191
and have had all sorts of experiences in this land.

00:09:58.674 --> 00:10:02.888
Now please realize that you are a Sahaja yogi

00:10:03.089 --> 00:10:05.958
and live gracefully

00:10:06.159 --> 00:10:09.070
and be proud of being a Sahaja yogi.

00:10:09.277 --> 00:10:13.737
What is there to fight in Sahaja Yoga?

00:10:15.676 --> 00:10:18.271
You have not found a place to sit,

00:10:18.472 --> 00:10:21.345
or you have not found a place to see…

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:26.113
Is this a political meeting or what?

00:10:29.706 --> 00:10:33.500
I did not want to speak anything but I had no option

00:10:33.701 --> 00:10:38.161
when I saw you I had to say it.

00:10:38.795 --> 00:10:43.849
Now if any Sahaja Yogi shows quarrelsome attitude,

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:47.921
he will be thrown out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:48.511 --> 00:10:51.542
There is no other way to correct this.

00:10:51.753 --> 00:10:54.546
Everyone should live with affection.

00:10:55.034 --> 00:10:57.337
If you cannot behave yourself,

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:01.043
then why are you in Sahaja yoga?

00:11:04.306 --> 00:11:07.172
It is our Baba special character

00:11:07.323 --> 00:11:09.935
that he never got angry with anybody,

00:11:10.136 --> 00:11:13.476
and he would never talk ill of anyone,

00:11:13.674 --> 00:11:18.724
and never complained about anybody.

00:11:19.486 --> 00:11:21.946
He would praise everybody.

00:11:22.147 --> 00:11:25.190
I used to get misguided

00:11:25.391 --> 00:11:29.294
how can everybody have such a good state.

00:11:29.635 --> 00:11:31.903
I would never understand.

00:11:32.104 --> 00:11:36.858
But Baba brought people together with love,

00:11:37.172 --> 00:11:39.759
it may be just anybody.

00:11:39.956 --> 00:11:44.377
He would never sit in My car,

00:11:45.591 --> 00:11:49.638
never visit to My house.

00:11:50.603 --> 00:11:54.145
He was very selfless and understanding.

00:11:54.509 --> 00:11:57.494
He also belonged to this Maharashtra,

00:11:57.695 --> 00:12:00.654
but he was never so rude.

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:04.147
Till the end He was not rude.

00:12:04.348 --> 00:12:07.911
Such a great personality he was.

00:12:08.433 --> 00:12:10.910
You have joined this place,

00:12:11.111 --> 00:12:14.571
so at least follow some of his good qualities.

00:12:17.154 --> 00:12:19.420
Now, this,

00:12:30.977 --> 00:12:35.405
we have built this temple for music

00:12:36.524 --> 00:12:39.478
and other form of arts.

00:12:39.677 --> 00:12:43.240
Your children must progress in these fields.

00:12:43.478 --> 00:12:46.547
They must understand our classical music.

00:12:46.746 --> 00:12:53.587
These foreigners understand your music more than you do, it's a shame.

00:12:54.704 --> 00:12:59.840
We don’t understand basics, taal, nothing,

00:13:01.131 --> 00:13:03.623
then what’s the use?

00:13:03.976 --> 00:13:07.515
You may not be a student of this place,

00:13:07.682 --> 00:13:12.142
still, you must have knowledge about music.

00:13:12.486 --> 00:13:18.688
Unless you know, what is raga, what is tala,

00:13:21.363 --> 00:13:24.886
you cannot enjoy music.

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:28.553
I request you all

00:13:29.348 --> 00:13:33.938
to leave aside your quarrelling nature

00:13:37.008 --> 00:13:40.671
and develop goodness within you.

00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:44.026
This is the work of Sahaja Yoga,

00:13:44.227 --> 00:13:47.651
but, if you sow seeds in unfertile land,

00:13:47.852 --> 00:13:50.009
you cannot reap anything.

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:52.596
I sometimes feel that.

00:13:52.797 --> 00:13:54.709
But now things are better

00:13:54.910 --> 00:14:00.662
with many people coming to Sahaja Yoga and they are welcome.

00:14:01.504 --> 00:14:05.975
So, don’t just come to learn music here.

00:14:06.912 --> 00:14:09.911
You must learn to behave in a sahaja way,

00:14:10.112 --> 00:14:12.616
understand the sahaja way,

00:14:12.817 --> 00:14:16.800
understand the greatness of Sahaja Yoga - you should absorb these things within you.

00:14:17.001 --> 00:14:19.726
If you don't learn this,

00:14:20.092 --> 00:14:22.266
it is useless.

00:14:23.566 --> 00:14:26.708
There are many music schools around.

00:14:26.909 --> 00:14:29.353
Everywhere there are music schools.

00:14:29.554 --> 00:14:33.503
By learning music from these schools if you are going trouble others,

00:14:33.704 --> 00:14:36.759
it is better not to learn music at all.

00:14:37.888 --> 00:14:43.287
So I request you all, please,

00:14:43.978 --> 00:14:46.496
that now with this music,

00:14:47.565 --> 00:14:50.859
bring the music of your life

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:54.185
into your day-to-day practice.

00:14:55.931 --> 00:14:58.402
Unless you follow this,

00:15:02.989 --> 00:15:07.490
this program will not be accomplished.

00:15:09.143 --> 00:15:12.947
Take a vow today, we will not fight.

00:15:13.148 --> 00:15:16.912
Even if anyone says anything, we will not fight.

00:15:17.113 --> 00:15:20.722
The second problem here is about making money.

00:15:20.923 --> 00:15:24.213
they are not leaving it at all.

00:15:24.414 --> 00:15:27.562
People make money even in Sahaja yoga.

00:15:27.763 --> 00:15:30.173
They don't understand.

00:15:30.374 --> 00:15:34.318
How did people here get this greed?

00:15:34.519 --> 00:15:37.872
It has spread so much

00:15:40.806 --> 00:15:43.854
that I am fed up.

00:15:44.259 --> 00:15:48.311
Are you going to change or not, now you decide.

00:15:48.512 --> 00:15:52.104
Most important thing is that there should be music in our lives,

00:15:52.305 --> 00:15:54.777
there should be rhythm in our lives.

00:15:54.978 --> 00:15:58.301
Instead of being rhythmic,

00:15:58.502 --> 00:16:03.764
fighting all the time is not proper.

00:16:05.846 --> 00:16:08.554
Thinking bad about others

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:10.942
and seeing only self interest

00:16:11.143 --> 00:16:13.343
it's a wrong quality.

00:16:14.478 --> 00:16:17.872
Now forget what happened in the past.

00:16:18.073 --> 00:16:20.360
You should bring such people in Sahaja Yoga now

00:16:20.561 --> 00:16:22.980
who are understanding, loving,

00:16:23.181 --> 00:16:27.652
and who will bring all people together.

00:16:31.361 --> 00:16:36.062
Fortunately I also know Hindi language.

00:16:36.263 --> 00:16:39.103
And the thing is,

00:16:39.849 --> 00:16:43.161
now if we take to music,

00:16:43.362 --> 00:16:46.240
we ourselves should also be in rhythm.

00:16:46.441 --> 00:16:48.568
What does it mean?

00:16:48.769 --> 00:16:54.524
It means that the state of human beings,

00:16:56.986 --> 00:16:59.676
is to be corrected

00:17:00.264 --> 00:17:02.999
and has to be made rhythmic

00:17:03.174 --> 00:17:05.922
and has to be made organized.

00:17:06.123 --> 00:17:07.772
Unless it is done,

00:17:07.955 --> 00:17:09.428
it is of no use.

00:17:09.629 --> 00:17:13.110
What is the difference between you people and others?

00:17:13.311 --> 00:17:15.927
If you also keep fighting,

00:17:16.128 --> 00:17:18.459
then what is the use?

00:17:18.797 --> 00:17:23.416
The most important thing is that in your mind,

00:17:23.617 --> 00:17:28.409
you should develop love, reverence and devotion.

00:17:29.504 --> 00:17:32.596
so that you become peaceful

00:17:32.763 --> 00:17:34.917
and others also become peaceful.

00:17:35.118 --> 00:17:38.609
Without peace, music has got no meaning.

00:17:40.049 --> 00:17:45.864
Today, with the idea of Baba mama,

00:17:46.708 --> 00:17:51.141
this beautiful building has been erected.

00:17:52.554 --> 00:17:58.663
And with this I wish that people will take to music within them,

00:17:59.612 --> 00:18:04.917
and people have a peaceful atmosphere.

00:18:05.118 --> 00:18:08.420
Today world needs only Peace.

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:11.911
Everything else we have today is worthless.

00:18:12.112 --> 00:18:15.278
We have to see how peaceful we are.

00:18:15.479 --> 00:18:20.889
If this peace does not have an effect on our country

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:23.393
then on which country will it have?

00:18:23.594 --> 00:18:30.061
Everybody says that India is the ambassador of peace.

00:18:30.262 --> 00:18:32.770
But, I can’t see anything like it.

00:18:32.971 --> 00:18:37.227
There is quarrel and fighting among one another.

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:40.809
Don't know what to say?

00:18:41.331 --> 00:18:44.388
So those who want to learn music,

00:18:44.589 --> 00:18:47.742
must have music in their hearts also.

00:18:48.785 --> 00:18:51.827
Should think from the heart.

00:18:52.028 --> 00:18:56.057
Running after money, running after women,

00:18:56.258 --> 00:18:59.363
and doing all sorts of wrong things

00:18:59.586 --> 00:19:03.335
is unbecoming of a musician.

00:19:03.536 --> 00:19:06.045
My eternal blessings

00:19:06.244 --> 00:19:09.846
that this organization should flourish

00:19:10.577 --> 00:19:14.948
and people coming here should learn music

00:19:15.149 --> 00:19:19.077
and make their lives rhythmic and full of music.

00:19:19.278 --> 00:19:23.816
Hope you will fulfil my desires.

00:19:24.709 --> 00:19:29.025
Whenever you get angry, get annoyed

00:19:29.653 --> 00:19:32.558
whenever you have complains,

00:19:32.759 --> 00:19:39.326
tell yourself that ‘I am a sahaja yogi'.

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:43.156
I am different from others,

00:19:43.357 --> 00:19:46.807
Mother has transformed me into something else.

00:19:47.008 --> 00:19:48.863
If you understand this

00:19:49.054 --> 00:19:52.474
you will recognise your glory.

00:19:52.826 --> 00:19:56.284
But if you cannot achieve this,

00:19:56.485 --> 00:19:58.929
then it is useless.

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:03.746
Then making 50 such organizations

00:20:04.191 --> 00:20:06.675
also is of no use.

00:20:07.847 --> 00:20:11.408
Fighting for small, small things,

00:20:12.005 --> 00:20:14.167
doesn't become you.

00:20:14.368 --> 00:20:17.302
You are Saints now.

00:20:17.503 --> 00:20:21.076
You have achieved great heights,

00:20:21.277 --> 00:20:23.512
very great heights,

00:20:23.713 --> 00:20:26.548
And You do not realize that.

00:20:26.749 --> 00:20:30.666
You don't understand that "We are great saints now".

00:20:30.867 --> 00:20:32.973
You think that you are

00:20:33.174 --> 00:20:36.054
the same beggar on the street as you were before.

00:20:36.255 --> 00:20:37.629
No, no.

00:20:50.955 --> 00:20:53.318
My special blessings

00:20:53.913 --> 00:20:57.596
that you all should become musical.

00:20:58.956 --> 00:21:01.852
Today I wanted to bless you all,

00:21:02.053 --> 00:21:07.383
that you become completely musical in temperament,

00:21:07.584 --> 00:21:09.979
rhythmic

00:21:10.814 --> 00:21:18.409
and entertaining to others

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:21.202
and not quarrelsome.

00:21:21.703 --> 00:21:25.482
Now, as you have seen that how the western music

00:21:25.683 --> 00:21:28.593
is taking to wrong side,

00:21:28.794 --> 00:21:30.896
to the wrong progress,

00:21:31.097 --> 00:21:34.325
and I don’t want you to fall into that.

00:21:34.526 --> 00:21:36.945
This will all disappear, I know,

00:21:37.089 --> 00:21:40.072
because it is very destructive.

00:21:40.877 --> 00:21:44.714
But, after coming to Sahaja also

00:21:47.088 --> 00:21:50.390
if you have the same destructive idea,

00:21:50.591 --> 00:21:52.489
how can anybody help you?

00:22:35.962 --> 00:22:43.596
So I hope you will fulfill my ideal, about you.

00:22:44.894 --> 00:22:46.528
May God bless you.
