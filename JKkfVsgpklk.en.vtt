00:05:16.254 --> 00:05:21.627
Today, I bow to all the Sahaja Yogis of the world.

00:05:26.475 --> 00:05:32.859
First, I used to bow to all the seekers of the Truth

00:05:36.031 --> 00:05:41.136
and today, all those seekers of Truth

00:05:42.427 --> 00:05:48.683
have shown that truth is love, and love is truth.

00:05:50.392 --> 00:05:56.639
With the power of love, you have been able to establish

00:05:57.392 --> 00:06:04.115
a beautiful place for Sahaja Yoga in England.

00:06:11.784 --> 00:06:20.504
I must congratulate you all for fulfilling your desire

00:06:20.941 --> 00:06:27.610
so beautifully, working it out together

00:06:32.131 --> 00:06:39.392
and the collectivity

00:06:39.417 --> 00:06:45.589
which you have achieved – not only in England, but all over the world.

00:06:46.218 --> 00:06:54.109
All of you feel so responsible that Shudy Camps

00:06:55.447 --> 00:07:00.593
should be a perfect piece of art,

00:07:00.618 --> 00:07:03.337
the perfect piece of love,

00:07:03.362 --> 00:07:11.206
perfect piece of peaceful atmosphere.

00:07:19.948 --> 00:07:23.889
There’s dedication, no doubt,

00:07:24.241 --> 00:07:30.271
but apart from dedication, the collective oneness, the integration

00:07:33.105 --> 00:07:40.110
of your feelings is beautifully demonstrated.

00:07:42.071 --> 00:07:48.211
Even Indians wanted to send you something

00:07:48.362 --> 00:07:55.958
for Shudy Camps and it was not ready before I left,

00:07:56.022 --> 00:08:02.113
so they were saying that they will be able to give you
when you come there for your tours.

00:08:03.259 --> 00:08:09.729
Every country wanted to express their love.

00:08:15.458 --> 00:08:21.862
They say love begets love; I loved you, no doubt,

00:08:21.887 --> 00:08:31.570
but in so many faces, when you see the reflection of that Divine Love,

00:08:32.285 --> 00:08:38.089
it is multiplied beyond My expectation.

00:08:39.391 --> 00:08:46.416
I cannot describe My joy:

00:08:48.234 --> 00:08:55.234
you can sing, dance, jump,  say “Jai” – I also feel like saying your “Jai”,

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:01.237
and singing like …

00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:09.365
This is the beginning of our collective effort

00:09:09.578 --> 00:09:14.519
and we have to go further and further with this.

00:09:15.551 --> 00:09:22.551
Tomorrow is a great day for Me, as well as for you –

00:09:24.302 --> 00:09:29.635
it has to be one step forward;

00:09:30.943 --> 00:09:38.981
very substantial step forward and you must be looking forward to it.

00:09:40.963 --> 00:09:48.205
I am sure something will work out in the inner building of Shudy Camps,

00:09:49.184 --> 00:09:52.263
in every Sahaja Yogi’s heart.

00:09:54.286 --> 00:10:00.115
All that is expressed outside has to be expressed within,

00:10:00.711 --> 00:10:03.104
and that is what we have to achieve.

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:06.096
May God bless you!

00:10:40.335 --> 00:10:46.198
