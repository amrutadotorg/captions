05:16.254 --> 05:21.627
Today, I bow to all the Sahaja Yogis of the world.

05:26.475 --> 05:32.859
First, I used to bow to all the seekers of the Truth

05:36.031 --> 05:41.136
and today, all those seekers of Truth

05:42.427 --> 05:48.683
have shown that truth is love, and love is truth.

05:50.392 --> 05:56.639
With the power of love, you have been able to establish

05:57.392 --> 06:04.115
a beautiful place for Sahaja Yoga in England.

06:11.784 --> 06:20.504
I must congratulate you all for fulfilling your desire

06:20.941 --> 06:27.610
so beautifully, working it out together

06:32.131 --> 06:39.392
and the collectivity

06:39.417 --> 06:45.589
which you have achieved – not only in England, but all over the world.

06:46.218 --> 06:54.109
All of you feel so responsible that Shudy Camps

06:55.447 --> 07:00.593
should be a perfect piece of art,

07:00.618 --> 07:03.337
the perfect piece of love,

07:03.362 --> 07:11.206
perfect piece of peaceful atmosphere.

07:19.948 --> 07:23.889
There’s dedication, no doubt,

07:24.241 --> 07:30.271
but apart from dedication, the collective oneness, the integration

07:33.105 --> 07:40.110
of your feelings is beautifully demonstrated.

07:42.071 --> 07:48.211
Even Indians wanted to send you something

07:48.362 --> 07:55.958
for Shudy Camps and it was not ready before I left,

07:56.022 --> 08:02.113
so they were saying that they will be able to give you
when you come there for your tours.

08:03.259 --> 08:09.729
Every country wanted to express their love.

08:15.458 --> 08:21.862
They say love begets love; I loved you, no doubt,

08:21.887 --> 08:31.570
but in so many faces, when you see the reflection of that Divine Love,

08:32.285 --> 08:38.089
it is multiplied beyond My expectation.

08:39.391 --> 08:46.416
I cannot describe My joy:

08:48.234 --> 08:55.234
you can sing, dance, jump,  say “Jai” – I also feel like saying your “Jai”,

08:58.830 --> 09:01.237
and singing like …

09:05.611 --> 09:09.365
This is the beginning of our collective effort

09:09.578 --> 09:14.519
and we have to go further and further with this.

09:15.551 --> 09:22.551
Tomorrow is a great day for Me, as well as for you –

09:24.302 --> 09:29.635
it has to be one step forward;

09:30.943 --> 09:38.981
very substantial step forward and you must be looking forward to it.

09:40.963 --> 09:48.205
I am sure something will work out in the inner building of Shudy Camps,

09:49.184 --> 09:52.263
in every Sahaja Yogi’s heart.

09:54.286 --> 10:00.115
All that is expressed outside has to be expressed within,

10:00.711 --> 10:03.104
and that is what we have to achieve.

10:03.610 --> 10:06.096
May God bless you!
