1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:14,730
Today is the first day, New Year's Day, according
to the Shalivahana Calendar, who were My forefathers.

2
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:22,860
And in the whole of Maharashtra, it is regarded
as the New Year Day and the best day to start

3
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,940
anything.

4
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:32,680
So today I've decided to have Mahamaya Puja.

5
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:45,590
I have never talked about Mahamaya, as it
is not to be talked or told - it's a secret,

6
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:49,750
as they say.

7
00:00:49,750 --> 00:01:00,260
It's the basic of Sahaja Yoga, I should say,
because it's described, when the Goddess comes

8
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:09,220
in the Sahasrara, the Shakti, She is Mahamaya
- "Sahasrare Mahamaya," already described.

9
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:18,260
She has to be the Mahamaya, means She should
camouflage Herself fully.

10
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:28,410
Nobody should be able to know Her as the Goddess,
to begin with; and even if they get Realization,

11
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:35,759
they should not reach to the end of it.

12
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,120
There are many reasons for that.

13
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,562
The first thing: the job.

14
00:01:40,562 --> 00:01:44,350
The job of Mahamaya was to give Realization.

15
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:52,560
Now, if I had come on a tiger with a sword
in My hand, nobody would have stood near Me.

16
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,070
You all would have run away from Me.

17
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:04,990
In any other form, if the Goddess had come,
She could not have done what She was supposed

18
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:06,180
to do.

19
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:15,059
Moreover, only if She had come as the Mother
of Christ, or Shri Sitaji, or you can say

20
00:02:15,059 --> 00:02:18,680
Fatima - they all ended their lives.

21
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:25,739
They had to go away from this world so early,
I mean.

22
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:28,730
They couldn't do any work whatsoever.

23
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:36,540
Now this work, difficult work of giving Realization
to others, is very intricate.

24
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:46,069
It has to work out in such a manner that nobody
feels that it is done by some great personality

25
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:51,519
or with a great awe or fear.

26
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:58,849
So the Mahamaya Incarnation has to come, that
people can come closer.

27
00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:12,049
Also, it has one advantage, very great advantages,
that when a simple person who's just a housewife

28
00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:17,409
starts giving Realization, people are flabbergasted.

29
00:03:17,409 --> 00:03:21,489
Also they think, "If She can do it, why not
we do it?

30
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:24,669
After all, She's just an ordinary housewife.

31
00:03:24,669 --> 00:03:26,489
So, it's all right.

32
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:29,199
If She can do something, we can also do it."

33
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:38,949
So they have self-confidence, you see, and,
being a Mother, She does Her loving part,

34
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:42,680
Her compassion, but the greatest is the patience.

35
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:48,590
You see, none of them had so much patience,
all these Incarnations who came.

36
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:55,849
You see how they disappeared from this Mother
Earth quickly, I'd say, by some excuse or

37
00:03:55,849 --> 00:03:56,849
other.

38
00:03:56,849 --> 00:04:04,739
But I had to stay, I don't know how long,
but it has to be done up to a point, this

39
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:06,779
work of giving Realization.

40
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:19,870
The third thing was that you have to be identified
into My Body, into My cells of My Body, but

41
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:29,030
this is a more difficult task because supposing
one of you becomes stupid, becomes foolish,

42
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,560
quarrelsome.

43
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,300
Anything you do, any small thing, it hurts
Me.

44
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,400
It has to, but I don't think about Myself.

45
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,750
I always think about you.

46
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:45,289
So it's an indication to Me that something
has gone wrong somewhere.

47
00:04:45,289 --> 00:04:48,050
Somebody is doing something wrong to somebody.

48
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,970
Some Sahaja Yogis are being tortured.

49
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,819
Some are sick.

50
00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:58,139
Anything like that, I work it out very intensely
and intimately.

51
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:04,180
Recently, today only, they told Me somebody
has got meningitis in Australia.

52
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,740
Immediately, I gave bandhan.

53
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:14,970
I'm sure such a person should be cured if
she has any faith in Me and she's in My being.

54
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:19,680
Or somebody is ill somewhere, they tell Me
and such a person is saved.

55
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,250
They call it a miracle.

56
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,199
It is not a miracle.

57
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,810
It's not a miracle.

58
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:30,240
It's again the Mahamaya's blessings are like
this.

59
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,590
You can't see how you are inside Me.

60
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,520
You can't see your reflection within Me.

61
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,520
You can't see.

62
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,919
This is Mahamaya.

63
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:42,770
This is the secret part of it, that you don't
know; and then when I feel the pain and if

64
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:48,090
I try, look at it, because I have power to
cures, so you get cured.

65
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:53,509
You don't know how it happens.

66
00:05:53,509 --> 00:06:14,479
Collectively, whatever you feel, I get it
in My Body.

67
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:22,139
For example, collectively, if you have a left
Vishuddhi, I get it.

68
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:28,180
If you have, say, right Vishuddhi, I get it.

69
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:37,229
Any Chakra that you catch, collectively, I
get that problem and I have to solve it because

70
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:39,870
it troubles Me, so I solve it.

71
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:44,879
It's a compulsion that I have to solve it.

72
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:48,590
Now in doing so, you see, you might think,
"Mother, we are troubling."

73
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:49,729
You are not.

74
00:06:49,729 --> 00:06:51,379
It's My doing.

75
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:54,469
I have taken you into Myself.

76
00:06:54,469 --> 00:06:56,930
You haven't.

77
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:00,279
So you don't have to worry as to, as if you
are troubling Me.

78
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,279
It's My own doing.

79
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,500
It's My own work.

80
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,500
It's My own responsibility.

81
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,370
And if I have done it, it's done it because
I am supposed to do it.

82
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:12,389
That's the job I have to do.

83
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:15,580
So there's nothing to feel bad about it.

84
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:19,139
But now, what is the purpose?

85
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:29,190
As I told you, is that I could come close
to you and I need not, sort of, fill you with

86
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:36,409
fear or awedness, or even a feeling that I
am not a human being.

87
00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:41,620
I behave exactly like human being, I react
exactly like human beings and all these powers

88
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,810
are hidden within Myself.

89
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:47,870
Unless and until you are a realized soul,
you won't understand.

90
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,659
Whatever you may do, you won't understand.

91
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:55,830
Or maybe in the previous life you had your
Realization, or maybe also you have done such

92
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:59,090
tremendous punyas that you can recognize.

93
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:03,830
There are people like that who have done it.

94
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:15,490
But to make it more, sort of, congenial to
you is to become absolutely a human being.

95
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:21,120
So I married, I have children, I have grandchildren
and I do shopping, as you see.

96
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,800
People are surprised how I take Coca-Cola.

97
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,680
I'm not supposed to take Coca-Cola!

98
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,879
Or I eat popcorn.

99
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,490
They're surprised.

100
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:34,810
But I have to be just like you.

101
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:37,470
But inside I am not.

102
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,470
Outside I am.

103
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:48,240
You see, My attention is such that it penetrates
into everything, and I remember each and every

104
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,250
thing very well.

105
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,820
My memory's very good, even at this age.

106
00:08:52,820 --> 00:09:00,029
So, you see, this attention itself is very
penetrating, and when it penetrates it carries

107
00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:05,310
with it all the powers that are required,
and acts.

108
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:11,950
It's a tremendous machinery, I should say,
which is very subtle and works wonders.

109
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:17,010
So you start telling Me that there is a miracle
that has happened, miracle that has happened.

110
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:24,510
Nothing is a miracle because if you're all
in My Body and if My Body is divine, then

111
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,529
what is a miracle?

112
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:30,389
It's all the communication, as this hand can
communicate with this hand, I communicate

113
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:31,730
with you.

114
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:40,800
But one thing is definite, that you should
not get lost with this rupa of Mahamaya.

115
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,709
It's a very dangerous thing because once you
get lost, "Oh, Mother!

116
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:50,900
After all" - you see, like that - then it
doesn't act, it doesn't work out.

117
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:59,550
It's not a casual thing, but I want to live
very casually Myself to show that I'm casual,

118
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,180
but I am not.

119
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:07,830
While you should not pay your attention casually,
that won't work out because you are in My

120
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:08,830
Body.

121
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:18,370
Say, every cell in My Body is aware, and every
cell has a reflector.

122
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:22,519
I don't know about, you know about it, but
there is a reflector in us, which works on

123
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:24,839
remote control.

124
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:28,200
So it works on remote control on your attention
also.

125
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,110
If your attention is not all right, it corrects.

126
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:35,779
It puts you - that's the best way we could
evolve human beings.

127
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:43,900
There was no other way out, because the attention
of the people is, on the whole, in the whole

128
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,100
world, is not yet on the Spirit.

129
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,160
But suddenly, they get a glimpse that there
must be something beyond.

130
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,139
So many religions have come, so many have
talked about it.

131
00:10:54,139 --> 00:11:02,040
So, they may say about it, they may talk about
it, but still the consciousness that we have

132
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:07,519
to be the Spirit is among very few people
and they are the ones called as the seekers

133
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,449
of truth, while the rest of the people are
not.

134
00:11:10,449 --> 00:11:11,779
They are busy with this or that.

135
00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:12,779
"Oh, I'm very happy.

136
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:14,001
I'm very happy with myself.

137
00:11:14,001 --> 00:11:15,959
You enjoy your holiday.

138
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:18,579
I'll enjoy my holiday."

139
00:11:18,579 --> 00:11:21,009
Like that they talk.

140
00:11:21,009 --> 00:11:28,579
So under these circumstances, one had to come
in a camouflage, enter into like - you see,

141
00:11:28,579 --> 00:11:34,290
they are like enemies, I would say, enemies
of God's Love.

142
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:40,620
So you have to enter into them like a spy,
camouflaging yourself, you see, and make them

143
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,389
dance here, here and there.

144
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:45,620
Let them get lost a little bit here and there.

145
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:51,580
Let them see for themselves because with Mahamaya,
you see, She allows you.

146
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:56,640
Now, there are some Sahaja Yogis who left
Sahaja Yoga, went off.

147
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,050
I said, "All right, if they have gone, very
good.

148
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:03,279
Good riddance of bad rubbish.

149
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,279
Doesn't matter."

150
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:05,820
And then they again come back.

151
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,930
"Mother, this happened to us.

152
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,470
That happened to us.

153
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,550
Somebody got this.

154
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,550
Somebody got that.

155
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:15,820
We met with an accident, then somebody got
the sickness.

156
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,620
Somebody is very unhappy.

157
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:21,690
We broke our marriage."

158
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:32,709
All kinds of things and when they say like
this, I mean, they do like this, I just smile.

159
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:34,139
So it's a bad coin.

160
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:35,520
All right, doesn't matter.

161
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:41,720
Again they come back to Sahaja Yoga, but they
are left behind than others.

162
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:46,820
They come up, but slowly, because they have
suffered, so they have come.

163
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:52,940
In a way, there's a good example for others
that we don't want to suffer any more.

164
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:59,420
The sufferings do not come from Mahamaya,
by any chance.

165
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:13,720
On the contrary, once you have called Me the
Mother, you see, there is a protective attention

166
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,290
on you.

167
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:24,350
Then you misbehave, you cross all the limits
and things, then it acts on you.

168
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:29,720
This action has taken place in many cases.

169
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:35,970
Some of them have come back, some are still
hanging around and are doing wrong things,

170
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:40,509
because they have done terribly wrong things
and they know they'll be found out.

171
00:13:40,509 --> 00:13:45,199
Now the worst thing that happens in Sahaja
Yoga that people try to make money out of

172
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:52,139
Me because they know I don't understand money,
I don't understand banking and I'm very bad

173
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:58,610
at it; but I'm not.

174
00:13:58,610 --> 00:13:59,610
I know everything.

175
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:00,610
I know everything about everyone.

176
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:01,800
They tell me lies.

177
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,620
I know that they're telling Me lies, but is
allowed.

178
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:08,759
Do what you like in Sahaja Yoga.

179
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:12,440
You, yourself, will have to pay for it.

180
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:18,949
It's something so great with this Mahamaya
rup, that, directly, I don't have to say anything.

181
00:14:18,949 --> 00:14:21,019
You don't even know that it's done.

182
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:24,129
When it happens, they come rushing to Me,
"Mother, it has happened."

183
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:31,819
Now, I have not done anything directly, neither
indirectly, but once you go out of the protection

184
00:14:31,819 --> 00:14:37,579
of your Mother, there are all negative forces
all around you, which also you don't see because

185
00:14:37,579 --> 00:14:39,100
you are partly blind.

186
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:43,200
You couldn't see your Mother and you couldn't
see these negative forces also.

187
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:49,199
Then you fall a prey to their talk, things,
whatever it is, or maybe into some paradoxical

188
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,699
culture, as you have here.

189
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:53,139
You may fall a prey to that.

190
00:14:53,139 --> 00:14:58,279
There's somebody I know in Sahaja Yoga who
has gone now and he's now drinking a lot and

191
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:02,399
he's doing all kinds of things.

192
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:08,319
So such a person gets lost because of his
doings.

193
00:15:08,319 --> 00:15:11,019
I am not doing anything to him.

194
00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:16,009
If you are with Me, if you are in Sahaja Yoga,
you are protected, you are looked after.

195
00:15:16,009 --> 00:15:21,480
But you have to stick on, you have to have
faith and even if there's any problem, it

196
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,480
gets solved.

197
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:29,470
But those who have gone out of it, who go
beyond My reach, then they suffer.

198
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:35,519
So, even indirectly, I would say, I'm not
in any way harming them because I've decided

199
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,819
not to harm anyone.

200
00:15:37,819 --> 00:15:39,180
That I have decided on.

201
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:43,000
Especially those who call Me "Mother", I don't
want to harm them.

202
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
But they get harmed.

203
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,589
No doubt, they get harmed very badly.

204
00:15:46,589 --> 00:15:51,889
So, if it has happened, just take it up, "All
right, doesn't matter.

205
00:15:51,889 --> 00:15:52,959
Mother forgives everyone.

206
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,060
It has happened, has happened.

207
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,370
This is a lesson for me.

208
00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:01,199
It was something because of it happened and
now I'm back."

209
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:07,800
And then you become sometimes a better Sahaja
Yogi than many of them.

210
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:17,310
This kind of happening is very common in every
country.

211
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:21,650
But you see, this whole culture, I feel, is
so paradoxical.

212
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:28,850
Whole culture is so paradoxical, and what
is paid for is something that is ugly.

213
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:33,480
What is paid for is something that is sinful.

214
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:38,110
Whatever that is filthy, dirty is paid for
and accepted.

215
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:44,520
It's very paradoxical because it goes against
growth of spirituality.

216
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:48,740
One side, you are spiritual, you want to be
spiritual.

217
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:54,689
Another side you have this paradoxical culture,
which takes you down to hell.

218
00:16:54,689 --> 00:16:58,850
It's like a story once Babamama told Me.

219
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:02,330
Very interesting story it is.

220
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:09,740
He said that some people did lots of punyas,
so they were taken to heaven, but they saw

221
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,460
everybody was meditating, nicely enjoying.

222
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,110
He said, "What is this?

223
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:15,420
We did this also with Sahaja Yoga.

224
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,500
What's the use of doing it here again?

225
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:21,950
We should have something else, so let's have
a look at the hell."

226
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:27,910
So they went down to see the hell and outside
they were having all these paradoxical culture

227
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:31,880
of nude women and nude men dancing, shouting,
screaming.

228
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,330
Dirty, filthy things going on there.

229
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:39,430
So they said, "This seems to be different,
you know."

230
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:43,750
So the people who were doing all these acts,
they asked, "Why are you here?"

231
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:48,420
They said, "We've come here only for seeing
the hell."

232
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,810
"Oh, all right.

233
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:50,810
There are peepholes.

234
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:51,810
You see through them."

235
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:55,480
So they had big, big holes, out of which they
started seeing.

236
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:04,070
So in one hole they saw people being put into
some sort of a filth, a pus and this and that.

237
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,780
Another into feces, this, that.

238
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:13,140
Another into a sort of a mire out of which
they could not come out, shouting.

239
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:18,700
Then there's another one where they were boiled
in the boiling oil and some were beaten up.

240
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:22,410
There were snakes and scorpions and this and
that.

241
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,330
They said, "What is this all?"

242
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,210
"That is hell you wanted to see.

243
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:27,210
That is hell.

244
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:28,370
You want to go, you can go there."

245
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:32,820
So they said, "What are you doing here?"

246
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,760
"This is publicity department.

247
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,740
For hell."

248
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:47,390
They ran back to heaven and asked forgiveness
that "We don't want, we don't want this hell,

249
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:49,750
had enough of it."

250
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:53,160
So, like that, you see, the whole world is
a camouflage.

251
00:18:53,160 --> 00:19:02,070
If you see, this is an anti-Mahamaya.

252
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:06,980
So they say that this maya is created by God.

253
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,350
No.

254
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:15,260
Maya that God has created is this world, this
whole universe and all that.

255
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:19,350
But this illusive life is created by human
beings.

256
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:25,930
Absolutely, through their projections of their
brains and mental capacities, they have projected

257
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:28,640
because money is everything.

258
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,290
If money is everything, by hook or crook,
if you have to get the money, then do what

259
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:34,290
you like.

260
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:39,380
And every day you read in the newspaper, I
mean horrible stories about how people want

261
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:44,310
to make money, how they want to sell their
daughters, how they want to sell their wives.

262
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:47,690
Anything is all right as long as you have
money.

263
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:50,420
If you can make money, nothing matters.

264
00:19:50,420 --> 00:20:01,190
So this is one of the illusions that human
beings have created is what you call is "money

265
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:07,410
maya" and, in that, comes also the wealth,
possessions, materialism.

266
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:16,300
Everything is created by human beings, and
this creation of materialism then boils you

267
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:25,770
down to a personality which is involved in
all sinful act.

268
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:30,400
Everything is all right because if money is
all right, materialism is all right.

269
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:39,720
For example, the way people went down to America
- Spanish - and killed so many aboriginals

270
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,720
there.

271
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:46,930
Then also English went and all kinds of people
went there in America.

272
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:54,140
The way they have tortured is something, is
you cannot think how human beings can behave

273
00:20:54,140 --> 00:21:04,010
like this towards ordinary people, who are
just simple people living in the jungles.

274
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:12,080
How can you do such a thing to them, such
horrible, you can call it a genocide?

275
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,950
It's really a terrible thing, they did it.

276
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:22,540
We know more about these Germans, the way
they behaved recently, but even in those days

277
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:25,110
they used to do all kinds of things.

278
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:30,500
And the nature, which is a Maya of God, which
how it takes respite.

279
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:38,380
There were people in America, Central America,
near River Mississippi in Missouri.

280
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,290
They're called as rednecks long time.

281
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:43,910
He must be remembering this.

282
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:49,660
And because they were called rednecks by the
blacks, they used to kill so many blacks,

283
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:55,860
they used to hang their children on the tree,
they used to throw their bodies in the river,

284
00:21:55,860 --> 00:22:03,640
sometimes get them drowned; did all kinds
of things to the black people, under the name

285
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:09,370
that they were white people and they're superior
and something like that, behaving worse than

286
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:10,900
animals.

287
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:20,170
Now you know, there, floods came in, terrible
floods came in and those floods drowned these

288
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:26,040
rednecks beyond their necks and so many were
dead.

289
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,630
One would say that "How could it happen?"

290
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:29,630
It is.

291
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:36,570
Another example I'll give you is the, you
see, the way Americans were treating all these

292
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:44,840
Bolivians and the Colombians, that they would
buy everything from them very cheaply, and

293
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,890
like wheat and everything, very cheap.

294
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:54,280
Just the minimum profits they had, and they
would sell it at a double price and make money.

295
00:22:54,280 --> 00:23:03,090
All this was really criminal to do from any
point of view, but they were doing it.

296
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:11,490
I went to - I don't know what year it was,
1978 or so - into Colombia and there was one

297
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:12,660
man came in the party.

298
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,660
I was with My husband.

299
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:17,700
He said, "I've heard You are a great, saintly
person from India.

300
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:23,710
Can You give us some blessings that we really
hit these Americans nicely and see them off?

301
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:31,310
Because the way they are exposing us to our
poverty and things, they're horrible."

302
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:34,960
I said, "Why do you want to hit them?"

303
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,890
"No, they require it, otherwise they'll not
be all right."

304
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:38,060
I was just in the party.

305
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,700
I didn't want to discuss it.

306
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,700
"All right."

307
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:46,240
And, you know, this cocaine came up there.

308
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,300
And if you go and see now that place - I've
been to, Bogota, with My husband - it was

309
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:57,370
like a shanty town, absolutely like a shanty
town, made of tin and this and that.

310
00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:02,150
Now, big, big buildings are there, and you
have escalators and everything.

311
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:06,970
They used to bring petroleum with the donkey's
cart.

312
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:09,150
Can you imagine?

313
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:15,620
In such a short time it has become such a
big country and not only that, but now the

314
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:20,940
whole America is afraid of them, even Australia.

315
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:25,390
The drugs are taken by Americans themselves.

316
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:33,500
In Washington there is such a lot of storage
of drugs that they don't know what to do,

317
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,130
and even the senators are taking to drugs.

318
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:37,130
Can you imagine?

319
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:42,160
I wouldn't be surprised one day Mr. Clinton
lands up with some drugs.

320
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:47,020
The way it is such a fashion, it is such a
fantastic thing for them.

321
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:52,380
You go to any party of elite people, which
I have to some time, they only talk about

322
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,380
drugs, you see.

323
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,380
"You want?

324
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,060
Which drug do you like?"

325
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,820
I said, "I don't like any drug."

326
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:58,820
"No.

327
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:01,870
If you want, you can get it cheaply in this,
you know, if you go there and get it there."

328
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:03,830
They discuss it in the elite parties.

329
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:08,730
Also about gurus, you see, which guru you
want.

330
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:11,560
"There is a sale on of a such-and-such guru.

331
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,580
On a bargain you can go."

332
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,580
Like that.

333
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,760
You know, it's all so stupid, I tell you.

334
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:20,650
I said, "These people are so immature, worse
than children."

335
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:24,110
They are not grown up, only in age.

336
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:31,530
They have done good maybe in mechanism and
all those things, but that has nothing to

337
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:39,930
do with your personality growth, and that's
why I find them just like dwarves the way

338
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:42,470
they have attitude towards things.

339
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:50,890
And everyone practically must have taken drugs,
everybody except for Asians may not have,

340
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:56,790
because now I have learnt that there are two
genes which protect the Asians, but the white

341
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:59,080
skin has not those genes which are to protect.

342
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:04,910
The other day in the lecture I told them that
there are two genes which are protective,

343
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:08,260
found only among Asians, means Chinese and
Indians.

344
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:12,880
All the rest of the people don't have those
genes, which should protect them.

345
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:19,280
So they are so vulnerable to all these nonsensical
things that are going on, and they take to

346
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,280
it so easily.

347
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:25,800
I used to wonder how these educated, good
people, I mean people of My husband's ranking

348
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,180
also were stupid like that.

349
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,310
Every time they would bring a new wife.

350
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:36,350
One day they brought, one of them, brought
a wife who was hardly about twenty years of

351
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,350
age.

352
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:38,940
This fellow is at least seventy.

353
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:39,940
I didn't know.

354
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:40,940
My husband pinched Me.

355
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:43,040
He said, "That's his wife.

356
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,040
All right?

357
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,020
Don't call her a grand-daughter."

358
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:51,490
I used to drop bricks after bricks there.

359
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:56,980
Such absurd people coming, and a seventy-year-old
man coming with a lady who's twenty years.

360
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:01,390
I mean, you can never think that she could
be his wife.

361
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:05,760
At the most a sister-in-law, at the most,
but I thought she was the grand-daughter so

362
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,490
he pinched Me and told Me that "Don't."

363
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:09,870
This is it, you see.

364
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:15,610
It's such a paradoxical world that if you
come from Sahaj to this, you see "What's going

365
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:16,610
on?

366
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:17,610
What are they doing?

367
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:19,500
What's the matter with them?"

368
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:24,990
Now, taking out clothes, is it something great
to take out clothes, you see?

369
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:31,900
In Switzerland, which is such a cold country,
I was wearing My sweater, My coat, covering

370
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:38,430
My head, wearing warm socks, everything because
they said, "Let's go out for, just for a drive."

371
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:41,410
So, we got down.

372
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:45,140
There's one lake called Lausanne.

373
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,540
Lausanne, there's a very big lake.

374
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:49,350
So, as usual, Gregoire ran up to see how is
the situation there.

375
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,800
He came back with a double speed.

376
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,900
He said, "No, no, Mother, You can't go there."

377
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,900
I said, "Why?"

378
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,900
"No.

379
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,900
You can't.

380
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:56,900
I am sorry.

381
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:57,900
You can't.

382
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,900
Let's go."

383
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,230
They were all topless women sitting there.

384
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:06,910
You know, this - in Australia they had, and
even New Zealand, they had cricket match.

385
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:11,070
They're supposed to be very good cricketers.

386
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:13,940
And when we opened the TV, the women were
sitting topless.

387
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,360
We closed it.

388
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,890
We couldn't see that, but I was told now they're
losing in cricket.

389
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:26,730
They will, definitely, compared to Indian
spinners, who are young innocent boys, you

390
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:28,790
see - very young, twenty, twenty-one.

391
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:33,550
They have to be because there's no innocence,
there's no chastity, there's no respect.

392
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:35,410
The women are sitting topless.

393
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:36,640
How can they win?

394
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,040
They're insulting the Goddess there only.

395
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,140
How can they win?

396
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:45,300
They cannot win, and a game like cricket is
something sensible.

397
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:51,830
Even, I don't know, in any game if they can
win, because if this - distract the attention

398
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:52,830
completely.

399
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:55,410
But why do they go like that?

400
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:59,000
Are all women trying to become prostitutes?

401
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,860
What is the sense in it?

402
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:03,280
I can't understand.

403
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,380
And this is something they don't understand.

404
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:11,030
If you tell them that, "You see, I was told
that Mrs. Thatcher openly said that in this

405
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:15,420
culture women must expose their body."

406
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,500
There's such a paradox.

407
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,870
Can't understand.

408
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:25,140
They show here Mother Mary as the sublime
personality, and they show here women as the

409
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:28,120
- women who are nude.

410
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:33,100
They want to become Mother Mary or what do
they want to become?

411
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:38,380
And people like this, horrible people like
this Michael Jackson - he is that - are so

412
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,210
prominent making money.

413
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:41,940
I mean, just see the paradox.

414
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:52,640
Can you say that this is an advanced country
when the ideas are so, so low?

415
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,620
How can it be?

416
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:04,320
After coming to Sahaja Yoga, you can see for
yourself, but it makes your, these protective

417
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,840
genes established in you.

418
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,570
This is the thing in Sahaj Yoga.

419
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:11,000
And suddenly, you people have given up all
that nonsense.

420
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,250
You don't want all that now.

421
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:20,900
Actually, if you see it properly from any
logical point of view, you see, without the

422
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:26,393
Maya of this nonsense - if you see it, you
can logically understand that it is wrong.

423
00:30:26,393 --> 00:30:32,460
You see, why do you feel jealous of another
man or woman?

424
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,799
You feel jealous.

425
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:37,370
That means you want just life, isn't it?

426
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:43,670
People have murdered, women have murdered
men or women because they were jealous.

427
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:51,830
If it was natural and normal and joy giving,
you should not have felt bad about it.

428
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:56,910
All these things should logically be understood
that, why we don't like this happening.

429
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:59,780
Or this happens to your own daughter, you
may not like.

430
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:04,400
Nowadays there are people who like it, also,
to the daughters.

431
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:10,500
But - now going to that limit of things, like
there's one person, say, he has something

432
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:15,250
to do with the daughter and the whole society's
against it, today.

433
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:23,070
But maybe tomorrow, with this Maya, this horrible
devil-maya, which is anti-maya, will work

434
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:27,020
out and maybe that nobody will mind it.

435
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,640
It may be.

436
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:37,140
If you people do not hold it right into your
hands, the culture side of Sahaj, I don't

437
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,390
know what's going to happen.

438
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:42,870
If you read newspaper every day, you feel
really dizzy, you don't understand in what

439
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:44,919
Maya these people are lost.

440
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:47,080
So it's an anti-maya.

441
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:50,820
Because Mahamaya has come, so anti-maya has
come.

442
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:56,020
Fifty years back or sixty years back, it was
not that bad, I can tell you.

443
00:31:56,020 --> 00:32:01,500
Once in a while people used to do something
nonsensical, but now it is rampant.

444
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,060
But it now has become a fashion.

445
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:10,040
It's worse than that, is that accepted as
a fashion, and if you're not in it, you're

446
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,040
out.

447
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:15,170
You have to be in the madhouse.

448
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:20,460
You should see this clearly because now you
have come into the Maya of God.

449
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:27,810
"Maya" also means love, the God's love, and,
in that, your eyes should open out and see:

450
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:30,480
what horrible things this they are doing?

451
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,480
What is this disco?

452
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:37,270
You know, in India they brought the disco
and, of course, some boys who were Muslims

453
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:45,070
actually were rich and they carried young
girls, because in disco the law was that you

454
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:51,350
must bring your partner - young girls who
were adults, maybe not be adults also, and

455
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:57,230
started giving them alcohol, drinking and
they got lost.

456
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,590
The parents wouldn't accept them.

457
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:04,280
They had to go to brothels or they were sold
out or I don't know what happened to them.

458
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,560
But that is the reaction in that country.

459
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,870
It may be one day they'll be accepted.

460
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:14,820
One day we'll have the same thing because
it has such a overpowering effect, and that's

461
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:17,590
why the Maya of God is such.

462
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:24,910
This, all these beautiful things are there
so you can get lost with it, you can see it,

463
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:27,400
you can picture it, you can paint it.

464
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,740
But no, they are not - they're not interested.

465
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,460
They'll make this also ugly.

466
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,060
They'll make every picture ugly.

467
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:35,520
They'll make every face ugly.

468
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:41,730
So this is the anti-maya that is there and,
for that, you need a Mahamaya to correct it

469
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:44,650
and to solve the problem.

470
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:50,270
The complete working of the Divine depends
on you people, wherever you are.

471
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:59,250
How many you are is not the point - wherever
you are, how intense you are, how you want

472
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:06,370
to work it out, how you want to put your attention
to.

473
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:13,909
It's very important how you are going to do,
it because you people should understand the

474
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:14,909
responsibility.

475
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:21,849
This world is getting drowned, and I feel
that at least eighty percent people will be

476
00:34:21,849 --> 00:34:23,329
finished.

477
00:34:23,329 --> 00:34:29,940
Ten would be hanging in between in limbo I
think, really, and ten percent will be Sahaja

478
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,259
Yogis, the way it is moving in the West.

479
00:34:32,259 --> 00:34:34,179
Maybe in India may not be.

480
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:35,179
I can't say.

481
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:37,540
India is very fast-moving Sahaja Yoga.

482
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:42,649
Also Russia and all these Eastern Bloc people
are just jumping into it.

483
00:34:42,649 --> 00:34:45,769
I don't know how they have discovered Me so
easily.

484
00:34:45,769 --> 00:34:46,990
They say My Face is evident.

485
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:54,879
I don't know what makes them think.

486
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:58,150
The another Maya is of power.

487
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:05,140
And the power of money if they can avoid,
then they try to have power over territory,

488
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,900
of the land, this, that.

489
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:13,220
That also made them mad quite a lot in the
past, but now they're all fighting for some

490
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:16,250
nonsensical land, which will never belong
to them.

491
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:20,730
It stays here permanently, eternally, but
the fights are going on.

492
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:26,789
Then, in the name of religion, they're fighting
for this area, that area or they're fighting

493
00:35:26,789 --> 00:35:34,789
for, say, just for changing their religion
or getting more people in that religion.

494
00:35:34,789 --> 00:35:38,500
I don't know what is their idea of religion
is.

495
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,410
Is religion meant for that?

496
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:41,820
Just think of it.

497
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,400
Nobody thinks like that.

498
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,920
What is it meant for?

499
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:52,040
So here, again, the Mahamaya has to work and
the Mahamaya works this way, that She integrates

500
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,569
all the religions.

501
00:35:53,569 --> 00:35:59,119
She shows that all religions are the same,
have the same spirituality.

502
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:04,299
It's on the same tree of spirituality, they
have grown.

503
00:36:04,299 --> 00:36:08,470
Instead of making people spiritual, they have
made them money-oriented or they have made

504
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:11,490
them power-oriented.

505
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:13,470
I mean it's the other way round.

506
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:21,609
It's like the tree growing underneath or something,
something absurd that you cannot explain and

507
00:36:21,609 --> 00:36:24,500
that is the thing is that illusive.

508
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,180
That illusiveness is called Maya.

509
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:32,640
And this illusiveness appeals to many people.

510
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,359
Appeals - that's the point I'm worried about.

511
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:42,509
Something is illusive, then they go on running
after that like a mirage and ultimately they

512
00:36:42,509 --> 00:36:43,509
are destroyed.

513
00:36:43,509 --> 00:36:51,160
So what you see, a picture just now, is that
at least so many - ten percent people - will

514
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,230
be saved, at the most.

515
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:59,299
But this is a very sad affair because it has
taken so much effort to make human beings,

516
00:36:59,299 --> 00:37:05,019
to make them all right, to make them sensible
and now what you find is that they are going

517
00:37:05,019 --> 00:37:06,259
to be all finished.

518
00:37:06,259 --> 00:37:12,480
It's too much to bear, too much to believe
in, but it is going to happen, if you people

519
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,410
do not take it up seriously and work it out.

520
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:21,210
For you, also, there should not be any illusions
because many of you are more busy with other

521
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:22,210
things.

522
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:25,059
To you other things are more important than
Sahaja Yoga.

523
00:37:25,059 --> 00:37:28,490
But whatever you are doing, you can bring
in Sahaja Yoga into that.

524
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:31,230
Into anything you can bring in Sahaja Yoga.

525
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:36,900
I said in politics, in agriculture, in social
life, in your jobs, everywhere you can bring

526
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:37,900
Sahaja Yoga.

527
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:45,779
By your own behavior, by your own intelligence,
you can bring in Sahaja Yoga into every field,

528
00:37:45,779 --> 00:37:49,059
which you have to think about, "Where can
we take Sahaj Yoga?

529
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:50,410
Where can we work it out?"

530
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:59,400
And this is what is to get into the Maya of
God, that you get rid of all the illusions

531
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:04,770
which are false, which do not allow you to
see the right thing, and then seriously to

532
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:08,080
get into the productive side of Sahaja Yoga.

533
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:14,470
Can you imagine how productive is Sahaja Yoga,
how the miracles work out, how there is this

534
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:19,290
Divine Power is anxious to help, despite all
this Mahamaya and all that.

535
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:26,700
I'll give you the example of My grandson now
because this time we had a big Maya on him.

536
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:31,040
He was - I told him that, "You should not
go to Cambridge, you know."

537
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:35,210
I said, "They don't give admissions normally
and, moreover, it's more sort of theoretical

538
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:37,500
things, not actually good for you.

539
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,390
You'll be bored stupid there, so don't go."

540
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:41,760
He wouldn't listen to Me.

541
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:46,150
Then he agreed, "All right, if I get admission
in these, these big universities in America

542
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:47,150
I'll go."

543
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,250
But he didn't try.

544
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,250
Nothing of the kind.

545
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:55,230
Last minute we sent him a application and
he sent that application.

546
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:56,430
Last minute.

547
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:58,790
They said, "You cannot come.

548
00:38:58,790 --> 00:38:59,790
This is that.

549
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:06,000
You have to prepare for this exam, SAT exam,
that exam", and then he got a fright.

550
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
You see, which he learnt.

551
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,279
"My God, I thought so easy to go to America.

552
00:39:09,279 --> 00:39:10,930
It is not."

553
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:13,420
Even if you certify money it is not easy.

554
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:18,630
Then he started thinking that "What was I
thinking about Cambridge, Cambridge so much?

555
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:22,180
This is the same, equally the same difficult
thing.

556
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:28,660
" Until then he wanted to go for SAT, there
to sit for an exam, but actually the appearing

557
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:33,980
of the examination was only after six days
and I thought, "How can he go?

558
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:36,210
Six days he cannot prepare even."

559
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:38,430
So they said, "You cannot come for SAT here."

560
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:40,319
Now he was settled down in India.

561
00:39:40,319 --> 00:39:41,760
He didn't know what to do.

562
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,960
Still he was saying, "I'll try for this Cambridge
again and this."

563
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,650
I said, "Now, forget it."

564
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:49,880
He wouldn't listen to Me.

565
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,359
Then he was very disappointed.

566
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:57,840
He telephoned to Me to say that "I think that
if I have to go to America, I'll go in a good

567
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,840
university.

568
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:04,019
Otherwise, no use going to a cheap university;
I can get better education in India."

569
00:40:04,019 --> 00:40:05,019
So I said, "All right."

570
00:40:05,019 --> 00:40:08,960
Then I gave a bandhan because he wanted to
go abroad and learn something.

571
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,960
It's all right.

572
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:13,980
Can you imagine, it has worked like a real
miracle.

573
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:19,170
The university wrote to him that he is admitted
unconditionally.

574
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:20,210
Nobody did anything.

575
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:22,740
Nobody wrote anything.

576
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,010
Nothing.

577
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:25,010
They have said it.

578
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:30,119
None of them can understand what has happened,
how did they get unconditional admission?

579
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:35,940
So, you see, it's a miracle, but before that
this Maya was to be played, otherwise he would

580
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:39,069
never have seen the importance of it.

581
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:41,549
So, in your lives also, such a Maya plays.

582
00:40:41,549 --> 00:40:43,730
When you do not want to do the right thing.

583
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:45,269
All right, do it.

584
00:40:45,269 --> 00:40:46,430
You do this.

585
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:47,970
All right, do that.

586
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:48,970
Do that.

587
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:50,680
Ultimately, you learn a lesson.

588
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,009
I don't say no, if you say, "Mother, I want
to do it."

589
00:40:53,009 --> 00:40:54,009
"All right, go ahead."

590
00:40:54,009 --> 00:40:55,009
"I want to do that."

591
00:40:55,009 --> 00:40:57,510
"Oh, go ahead, whatever you want to do."

592
00:40:57,510 --> 00:41:02,420
If I find you congenial, I may tell you that
"Better not do, it's not going to help you."

593
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:10,200
But then they,when they get a complete disillusionment,
then they take to the right decision, come

594
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:16,470
to the right thing because, see, let them
try with their own freedom, but then they

595
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:18,259
realize that, "What Mother said was right.

596
00:41:18,259 --> 00:41:19,849
I should have done that.

597
00:41:19,849 --> 00:41:20,950
All right."

598
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:22,170
So this is it.

599
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:27,191
The Maya is like this, that it allows you
to do what you like.

600
00:41:27,191 --> 00:41:28,740
You use your freedom.

601
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:29,980
You go places to places.

602
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:32,210
Do what you want to do.

603
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:33,910
Whatever you think it proper, you do it.

604
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:40,670
All right, this is a part of the Maya, but
Mahamaya is that which brings you back, brings

605
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:47,720
you back to normal, brings you back to reality,
to understand.

606
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:51,400
It is at that point when you understand Mahamaya.

607
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,049
Like I would say Russians did.

608
00:41:54,049 --> 00:41:59,490
How they understood that I'm doing greater
work than Einstein?

609
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:02,329
"See, what is Einstein?

610
00:42:02,329 --> 00:42:04,990
He is just working with the matter.

611
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:08,349
You are working with human beings, do You
realize, Mother."

612
00:42:08,349 --> 00:42:13,780
To them I am higher than all of them, greater
than all of them, which is a fact also, I

613
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:14,780
must say.

614
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:21,590
It's fact in a way that the way work is done,
but doesn't mean that it's something to be

615
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:25,029
ego about it, because if I am made like that,
I am doing it.

616
00:42:25,029 --> 00:42:26,029
What is so special?

617
00:42:26,029 --> 00:42:29,630
I've been like this, so I'm like that.

618
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,210
What is so special?

619
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:35,690
One gets the pride and the ego only when you
think you are doing something more beyond

620
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:36,690
you.

621
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:37,690
You see, it's all there.

622
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:38,690
I've already got it.

623
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:40,839
Now, see this tent is meant to give shade.

624
00:42:40,839 --> 00:42:46,299
Now if it is giving shade, should it have
ego?

625
00:42:46,299 --> 00:42:48,109
Sun is meant to give you light.

626
00:42:48,109 --> 00:42:53,339
If it is giving light, it's giving light because
God has given him the light to be given, so

627
00:42:53,339 --> 00:42:54,759
he's giving light to you.

628
00:42:54,759 --> 00:42:56,249
Should he have ego?

629
00:42:56,249 --> 00:43:03,990
But you'll be, you see, assume that you have
got something special about you, then you

630
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:05,869
have to do that, whatever special you have.

631
00:43:05,869 --> 00:43:09,690
Now, the flowers are so beautiful, they're
so special, so charming.

632
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:13,040
I mean, I couldn't take out My attention from
them, they're so beautiful.

633
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,150
All right, but if they are so, they are so.

634
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:17,260
What is there?

635
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:22,490
They're not going to have ego about it, that
"We are so good, we are so beautiful."

636
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:25,710
No, none of that.

637
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:33,049
So this ego comes when there is again the
Mahamaya part of it, that you are in the Maya

638
00:43:33,049 --> 00:43:36,789
of your own understanding.

639
00:43:36,789 --> 00:43:39,279
Now you're Sahaja Yogis.

640
00:43:39,279 --> 00:43:40,410
You should be very proud.

641
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:43,900
You should be, I don't know.

642
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:50,460
Look at these horrible people who are not
at all connected with God.

643
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:51,660
They have nothing to do.

644
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:57,779
Yesterday that lady, she gives Me a lecture
that "Why don't you praise the Lord?," you

645
00:43:57,779 --> 00:43:58,779
see.

646
00:43:58,779 --> 00:44:00,480
She's giving Me a lecture.

647
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:07,880
So it is just a sort of a assumption that
"I am something great" that makes you ego,

648
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:12,460
but that is also a Maya, because you have
to learn.

649
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:20,880
Ultimately, your ego breaks and you understand
that "Oh, a Humpty-Dumpty it was."

650
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,440
Once you discover that, "I don't want to have
an ego any more."

651
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:28,200
I mean there are some Sahaja Yogis who refuse
to do any work of Sahaja Yoga.

652
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,200
I said, "Why?"

653
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:33,820
"Mother, we are too intelligent and our intelligence
cheats us and we'll develop ego."

654
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:36,450
I said, "Now this is an escape.

655
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:42,890
It won't, Sahaja Yoga can never give you ego,
but will give you joy.

656
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:44,890
If it is giving you ego, it's not Sahaj.

657
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:47,119
It should just give you joy.

658
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:52,869
Giving somebody to Realization or somebody
you're curing, somebody being kind, anything,

659
00:44:52,869 --> 00:44:55,089
it just gives you satisfaction and you enjoy.

660
00:44:55,089 --> 00:44:56,089
It's a fact.

661
00:44:56,089 --> 00:45:01,010
I mean, you have come all the way here, you
are playing such good music, all this.

662
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:04,150
Now you learnt Indian style, I don't know
how.

663
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:06,160
Anybody should be very full of ego.

664
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:09,910
But no, in the Maya of your Mother, you just
enjoy.

665
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:12,430
Maya should give you enjoyment.

666
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:18,940
That's the best thing that this Maya can give,
and you can enjoy it so much.

667
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:32,279
I think it is a very beautiful atmosphere
created by this Mahamaya.

668
00:45:32,279 --> 00:45:36,829
So you can enjoy each other, you can enjoy
My company, you can enjoy nature.

669
00:45:36,829 --> 00:45:44,039
Such a rapport, such a beautiful understanding
between everything else is there.

670
00:45:44,039 --> 00:45:49,770
Nobody is bothered as to who is higher, who
is lower, what is the position; how much money

671
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:52,510
he has got or what he has got.

672
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:54,180
Nothing, just you're all enjoying.

673
00:45:54,180 --> 00:46:00,380
If somebody has a talent, he enjoys because
he has a talent and the others also enjoy

674
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:02,410
because he has talent.

675
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:04,940
No jealousies, no rivalries, nothing.

676
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:06,200
Somebody sings better, all right.

677
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:09,349
They'll tell Me, "Mother, You know, he sings
very well."

678
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:19,109
There's one fellow in Paris and he is, I think
he's a black, from the black side, because

679
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:23,660
he has very curly hair, a very nice boy.

680
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:26,990
So, suddenly, somebody came from Italy.

681
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:29,029
"Mother, do You know he dances very well?"

682
00:46:29,029 --> 00:46:30,029
"How do you know?"

683
00:46:30,029 --> 00:46:31,029
"I've seen him dancing."

684
00:46:31,029 --> 00:46:33,329
"So when did you see me dancing?" he asked.

685
00:46:33,329 --> 00:46:36,060
"You know, you came to that program.

686
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:37,060
I saw that."

687
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:38,230
In a group he saw him.

688
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:40,769
He just got hold of him, "You'd better dance
before Mother."

689
00:46:40,769 --> 00:46:45,030
It was so much, you see, so joy-giving, this
kind of thing.

690
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:52,749
He saw him in some sort of a program where
they were at least two thousand people dancing.

691
00:46:52,749 --> 00:46:54,680
He picked him out.

692
00:46:54,680 --> 00:47:01,089
Now, he's from Paris, and he's from Italy,
and how his eyes picked him up and he brought

693
00:47:01,089 --> 00:47:02,089
him.

694
00:47:02,089 --> 00:47:03,089
"Mother.

695
00:47:03,089 --> 00:47:04,089
You'd better dance before Mother, must!

696
00:47:04,089 --> 00:47:05,230
You are very good."

697
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:06,390
And he was.

698
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:09,390
But you see I might have missed it or whatever
it is.

699
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:11,999
And even if I'd seen it I may not have asked
him.

700
00:47:11,999 --> 00:47:16,559
But this fellow went down there, and he's
got hold of him and he out put him here.

701
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:19,920
I mean, these things are so joy-giving, you
see.

702
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:27,480
It is otherwise, in the normal course, what
one would do, come before Me and start dancing,

703
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:31,200
whether know or not and try to show off.

704
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,200
Normally.

705
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:37,890
But the one who knows never brought like that,
"Now, come along" and in such an impersonal

706
00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:40,670
way he saw him and brought him.

707
00:47:40,670 --> 00:47:47,799
It makes no difference whether they're from
Russia, or from America, or from India.

708
00:47:47,799 --> 00:47:52,109
So all these differences which are skin deep
are finished.

709
00:47:52,109 --> 00:47:57,799
And I find everybody appreciates everybody's
talent, everybody, how he speaks and suddenly,

710
00:47:57,799 --> 00:48:00,569
you'll find someone say, "Oh, he's such a
gem."

711
00:48:00,569 --> 00:48:02,130
"When did you meet him?"

712
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:03,920
"No, I've heard about him."

713
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:12,390
You see, all this appreciation and all this
beautiful feeling for others, you see, is

714
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:13,690
only possible through Sahaj.

715
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:16,109
No jealousies, no rivalries, nothing.

716
00:48:16,109 --> 00:48:21,820
These come because of an ignorance, which
creates the Maya about yourself, also: "I

717
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:22,820
am this.

718
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:24,329
I am that."

719
00:48:24,329 --> 00:48:27,700
And then the "I" comes down like that.

720
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:31,970
So all conditionings also can create a Maya.

721
00:48:31,970 --> 00:48:36,099
Many conditionings are there that "I am from
such a family.

722
00:48:36,099 --> 00:48:37,800
I am from such a thing."

723
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,630
That all has to be stopped.

724
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:45,940
So today's special day is this of New Year's
where they said, "Now, today's the most auspicious

725
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:51,999
day to start something new," and this Mahamaya's
dissolving has to be started.

726
00:48:51,999 --> 00:48:54,069
Gradually, you should try to understand.

727
00:48:54,069 --> 00:48:57,769
Many people ask Me, "Mother, how did You do
it?"

728
00:48:57,769 --> 00:48:58,769
Forget it.

729
00:48:58,769 --> 00:48:59,769
It's Mahamaya.

730
00:48:59,769 --> 00:49:00,769
Forget it.

731
00:49:00,769 --> 00:49:02,109
How did I do it?

732
00:49:02,109 --> 00:49:04,029
Just forget it.

733
00:49:04,029 --> 00:49:05,569
That part you need not go into.

734
00:49:05,569 --> 00:49:06,680
Just enjoy.

735
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:11,119
Just enjoy that you are in that Maya and you
are enjoying it.

736
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:14,940
It's the best way to enjoy this Mahamaya.

737
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:18,190
And today, for the first time, we have this
Puja of Mahamaya.

738
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:24,250
Because of Gudipadwa, I thought something
unique must be done which encompasses everything

739
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:27,319
of Sahaja Yoga, everything of Sahaja Yoga.

740
00:49:27,319 --> 00:49:34,670
It's not one incarnation, it's not one nadi,
it's not one Goddess, but all of it is there.

741
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:44,619
It's sometimes I say like a film is audio,
visual, everything is there - drama, music,

742
00:49:44,619 --> 00:49:46,519
also acting.

743
00:49:46,519 --> 00:49:48,200
Everything is there in a film now.

744
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:51,670
I mean that far, everything integrated.

745
00:49:51,670 --> 00:50:01,440
In the same way, I think Mahamaya has everything
in it: every part that you tell Me, everything

746
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,940
that you enjoy, everything that you discover.

747
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:10,019
Everything is in that vision of Mahamaya,
which has been created for you.

748
00:50:10,019 --> 00:50:12,522
May God bless you.
