00:00:01.317 --> 00:00:08.010
Hello! It’s good! How are you, all right?
It’s a good day.

00:00:08.211 --> 00:00:12.796
Today is an auspicious day because
21st is an auspicious day for us

00:00:13.021 --> 00:00:18.012
and today is Monday and the 7th month.

00:00:18.283 --> 00:00:25.052
All things combined together and it’s
a very nice, auspicious evening.

00:00:26.132 --> 00:00:28.835
So today I’ll talk to you about
auspiciousness

00:00:29.036 --> 00:00:32.430
because most of you are Sahaja Yogis.

00:00:32.688 --> 00:00:36.167
Who has come for the first time?

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:43.094
One, two, three, four, five. [Alfred?]
is there.

00:00:43.438 --> 00:00:48.951
So we have for the first time! All right.

00:00:58.706 --> 00:01:01.281
Thank you.

00:01:11.518 --> 00:01:15.849
I am sure somebody has talked to them about

00:01:16.073 --> 00:01:23.067
introduction to Sahaja Yoga or something?
Eh? And...

00:01:38.048 --> 00:01:42.765
To make it short, the whole thing
I don’t want to repeat,

00:01:42.966 --> 00:01:48.287
as I was thinking of talking on a new
subject to the Sahaja Yogis.

00:01:48.912 --> 00:01:51.565
Today,

00:01:56.419 --> 00:02:03.321
as you know all of you, and you can see
around also,

00:02:03.522 --> 00:02:15.705
that there’s a very big en-masse search
for the Truth - there is.

00:02:15.906 --> 00:02:18.504
I mean, even in this hall, you’ll be
amazed there might be

00:02:18.705 --> 00:02:20.852
five [or] six halls like this,

00:02:21.053 --> 00:02:25.530
where everybody is sitting in some hall
and doing something about it.

00:02:25.731 --> 00:02:32.567
I mean, there is no doubt a very big urge
to seek the Truth.

00:02:35.377 --> 00:02:45.580
This urge has come through our own
evolutionary understanding.

00:02:47.044 --> 00:02:51.664
When human beings have reached
a certain stage

00:02:51.865 --> 00:02:58.477
of sagacity, you can call it, or
a satisfaction,

00:02:58.678 --> 00:03:05.669
like when you have achieved a certain
amount of material well-being,

00:03:05.878 --> 00:03:15.680
or have seen something which doesn’t give
you a complete answer.

00:03:15.881 --> 00:03:21.108
Like Buddha. Like Buddha,

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:38.106
when he saw an old man and then a dead
man, he was puzzled at it;

00:03:38.307 --> 00:03:44.445
he was very much puzzled and he started
wondering what is this death,

00:03:44.646 --> 00:03:52.680
and why a human being becomes an old man.

00:03:54.117 --> 00:03:58.489
There was a prophecy about him when
he was a child,

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:07.830
that he may become an ascetic,
or he may give up his family life,

00:04:10.298 --> 00:04:15.342
to find the Truth - he might do that.
And the parents were worried

00:04:15.551 --> 00:04:19.157
and [his] father arranged for him a very
big palace

00:04:19.358 --> 00:04:24.711
with all the things available, and a very
beautiful wife and a child.

00:04:24.912 --> 00:04:32.995
But still from inside he had a feeling
of some incompleteness,

00:04:33.711 --> 00:04:41.676
of meaningless[ness] of life; and with
that meaningless feeling,

00:04:41.877 --> 00:04:49.911
once he saw a very, very old man and then
a dead man,

00:04:50.515 --> 00:04:58.323
and this just went into his head. This was
two thousand years back, more than that.

00:04:58.722 --> 00:05:05.594
But today there are many buddhas living.
I mean his first name was Siddharth.

00:05:05.854 --> 00:05:08.983
Siddharth itself is a very beautiful name –
Siddha, Artha:

00:05:09.184 --> 00:05:14.271
the one who has mastered his meaning.

00:05:14.472 --> 00:05:17.396
The beginning of the name itself was
very suggestive.

00:05:17.588 --> 00:05:22.319
But then he became The Buddha,
the enlightened one.

00:05:22.916 --> 00:05:30.746
But you are all siddharthas who are seeking
the Truth.

00:05:30.947 --> 00:05:34.913
He also went to Upanishadas, and he also
went to many people,

00:05:35.114 --> 00:05:37.612
he went to Benares and he was so
disillusioned

00:05:37.813 --> 00:05:41.759
the way the people were in Benares.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.193
He found there was no religion in them,
there was no God in them,

00:05:45.394 --> 00:05:53.012
there was no goodness in them. And they
were making money out of all this.

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.456
Then he went to some gurus, and this
and that,

00:05:55.657 --> 00:05:59.334
and everywhere he found that they did not
know the Truth.

00:05:59.535 --> 00:06:04.948
And he got tired, very tired:

00:06:06.403 --> 00:06:14.142
he had given up everything, just
in the search of Truth.

00:06:15.414 --> 00:06:19.271
And he was so tired, absolutely tired,

00:06:19.486 --> 00:06:26.033
and lay down under a tree, a banyan tree,

00:06:26.234 --> 00:06:33.753
we call it the Ashwattha: and then Sahaja
Yoga itself,

00:06:33.954 --> 00:06:37.129
[which] is the spontaneous awakening
of the Kundalini, took place,

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.922
and he got his Realisation.

00:06:43.614 --> 00:06:47.205
But that time there was no Mataji Nirmala
Devi to tell him

00:06:47.406 --> 00:06:51.113
that how he got it, where was
his Kundalini.

00:06:51.314 --> 00:06:55.220
He just felt the cool breeze coming in him
and he felt his Self,

00:06:55.389 --> 00:06:59.756
then he started talking about it and
telling people.

00:07:00.622 --> 00:07:06.175
He felt that, “Because I gave up
everything,

00:07:08.548 --> 00:07:12.873
that is why it has worked so.”

00:07:16.359 --> 00:07:21.472
It was a mistake, I would say, or
a misunderstanding,

00:07:22.916 --> 00:07:30.310
because what do you give up? Whatever
you hold on to.

00:07:31.072 --> 00:07:38.776
What is there to give up? All these stones?
What? What is their value?

00:07:41.612 --> 00:07:48.019
And this giving up is also a mental idea,
just a mental idea:

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:52.900
if you are not holding on to anything, what
are you going to give up?

00:07:55.457 --> 00:07:58.895
So this idea of giving up came

00:07:59.104 --> 00:08:03.632
to him because he thought that this must
be the reason.

00:08:03.833 --> 00:08:12.982
Supposing if I have to come to Caxton Hall,
I go all the way to Tottenham Court Road

00:08:13.183 --> 00:08:17.950
and then I go to East End and then come
down here.

00:08:18.151 --> 00:08:20.347
So if anybody comes to ask Me the way
I will say,

00:08:20.548 --> 00:08:24.905
“All right, go to Tottenham Court Road,
then to East End

00:08:25.166 --> 00:08:28.687
and then through the traffic you can land
up here!”

00:08:28.888 --> 00:08:33.128
But it’s only two minutes’ drive from
My house!

00:08:34.884 --> 00:08:40.698
So it was that kind of a misunderstanding,
which led him to think that there is no God.

00:08:40.899 --> 00:08:45.482
In a way it was a mid-step because if you
talk of God suddenly…

00:08:45.683 --> 00:08:49.072
Even today if I say, “There is God,” how
are you to believe Me?

00:08:49.273 --> 00:08:51.409
You can believe your vibrations, you can
believe

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:54.758
there’s a cool breeze coming in, you can
see the Kundalini rising,

00:08:54.959 --> 00:09:01.537
you can see the pulsation of that, but how
can you say that there is God?

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:08.344
Because I say there is. Because it is
pervading.

00:09:08.545 --> 00:09:14.359
And whatever I say, now you can test it
on your vibrations!

00:09:17.144 --> 00:09:21.137
Now how will you know that these vibrations
are telling you the Truth?

00:09:21.338 --> 00:09:29.455
It is very simple if you understand
the common sense of relativity.

00:09:29.656 --> 00:09:33.454
Like, bring two mad people from lunatic
asylum,

00:09:33.655 --> 00:09:38.497
absolutely certified as mad - all right?

00:09:38.735 --> 00:09:47.543
And then - Paul is laughing - and then get
two sane people sitting down.

00:09:47.744 --> 00:09:51.254
Now you put your hands towards the people
who are mad

00:09:51.455 --> 00:09:55.750
and you will get horrible burning in here,

00:09:55.951 --> 00:10:01.079
maybe in here, maybe in the whole hand -
on the left side.

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:05.044
And they themselves, before My photograph
will be going on like this (shaking).

00:10:05.245 --> 00:10:08.872
Many go, even they look sane but there
are many like that:

00:10:09.073 --> 00:10:18.162
all fanatics, all extremists, all sorts
of people they go on like this:

00:10:18.363 --> 00:10:25.488
spiritualists again, druggists, chemists,

00:10:29.042 --> 00:10:32.055
cancer patients.

00:10:33.335 --> 00:10:38.223
It’s a different frequency, different style
in every way. All right.

00:10:38.424 --> 00:10:43.330
So you get ten cases like that.

00:10:43.507 --> 00:10:51.240
Now you ask the question, “Is there God?”

00:10:53.875 --> 00:10:57.652
And you start getting cool breeze flowing
into you.

00:10:58.121 --> 00:11:04.563
“Is His power all-pervading?” You start
getting a cool breeze flowing into you.

00:11:04.804 --> 00:11:09.758
That is how you find out which is
the Truth,

00:11:11.546 --> 00:11:18.419
whether what I am saying, what vibrations
are telling, is the Truth or not.

00:11:18.689 --> 00:11:22.428
That is how you can test your vibrations.

00:11:23.811 --> 00:11:30.853
This search is on, and there are many shops
people have opened.

00:11:31.054 --> 00:11:34.949
This is not a shop, this is a temple.

00:11:35.578 --> 00:11:44.143
And a temple in the market place has
a very little value.

00:11:45.033 --> 00:11:49.849
If you have to climb up seven mountains
to go to a temple,

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:56.842
it has much more value, but only few can
reach there alive!

00:11:57.567 --> 00:12:04.999
So the temple had to come down to London,
to Caxton Hall, to talk to people.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:09.249
But in the market place if you have
a temple, you can notice

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:15.224
that people just go in the marketplace,
purchase something,

00:12:15.425 --> 00:12:17.576
before going they may throw 1 anna
(1/16 old Indian Rupee) there

00:12:17.777 --> 00:12:20.863
thinking, “Oh Lord, give me some profit
when I am going there!”

00:12:21.064 --> 00:12:25.733
And while coming back they will throw
another 5 annas there, saying that,

00:12:25.934 --> 00:12:29.102
“Oh all right, You have helped me
all right, 5p is all right for your sake,

00:12:29.303 --> 00:12:32.022
because I have got some profit I am giving
You.”

00:12:32.223 --> 00:12:39.466
Because they have a mentality of marketing:
even with God they bargain.

00:12:39.667 --> 00:12:46.422
The mentality is of marketing, of most
of the people, must be.

00:12:46.623 --> 00:12:51.351
But among them are real people also.

00:12:51.647 --> 00:12:56.047
Many, many real people are there who
are misled.

00:12:56.255 --> 00:13:00.056
Because they see the crowds going,
thousands of people going there,

00:13:00.257 --> 00:13:03.003
they are also misled.

00:13:05.764 --> 00:13:11.720
Ultimately, all those who are true seekers
will receive their Realisation.

00:13:11.921 --> 00:13:14.978
Even those who are not will receive it.

00:13:15.162 --> 00:13:20.140
But first those who are seeking are
the foundation stones.

00:13:20.341 --> 00:13:26.093
They have to build up themselves in such
a way that this big edifice

00:13:26.317 --> 00:13:33.472
could be raised on its back, on its
foundation stone.

00:13:33.673 --> 00:13:43.179
You people have to be such strong Sahaja
Yogis, such strong Sahaja Yogis,

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:52.786
that from your own life others would take
the lessons and understand

00:13:52.987 --> 00:13:57.060
that this is something that has really
transformed people,

00:13:57.261 --> 00:14:02.254
because the time of judgement has come
and of transformation.

00:14:02.455 --> 00:14:11.055
The Last Judgement is not direct, but
through transformation.

00:14:11.264 --> 00:14:14.418
It does not fail much.

00:14:14.619 --> 00:14:20.472
If you do not fail it, it is not going
to fail: it is going to work out.

00:14:20.673 --> 00:14:27.480
All sorts of permutations and combinations
it has worked out - all sorts.

00:14:27.681 --> 00:14:31.803
Now there’s no horrible guru I have
not tried.

00:14:32.004 --> 00:14:35.013
Of course, sometimes I hear some new
names from somebody.

00:14:35.214 --> 00:14:39.389
The other day I heard something new,
some other name.

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:42.417
And he is another funny thing!
He is teaching people, I don’t know.

00:14:42.602 --> 00:14:46.295
Something very horrid he is teaching
people.

00:14:46.496 --> 00:14:50.468
And maybe he may be successful for
a short time

00:14:50.684 --> 00:14:55.142
but ultimately those who are true seekers
will definitely come.

00:14:55.343 --> 00:14:57.830
Those who are supporting these wrong
organisations

00:14:58.031 --> 00:15:01.819
will also come to Sahaja Yoga because
they will recognise that,

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:08.935
“By supporting these people what are we
going to gain? We are going to go to hell!”

00:15:09.136 --> 00:15:10.795
They will see their gurus, how they are
behaving:

00:15:10.996 --> 00:15:14.387
ultimately they will come of course.
For the time being they do not.

00:15:14.588 --> 00:15:17.423
Sometimes it’s quite frustrating.

00:15:17.624 --> 00:15:20.961
For example, in Norwich we met two ladies -
elderly,

00:15:21.162 --> 00:15:24.195
quite elderly - but without any common
sense.

00:15:24.396 --> 00:15:28.533
And they said, “No, we have a guru who
has given us a name.”

00:15:28.734 --> 00:15:30.995
I said, “Why do you need a guru for that?

00:15:31.196 --> 00:15:34.534
You can pick up on the streets. A donkey
can give you a name!”

00:15:34.735 --> 00:15:37.264
And what is the name they have been given?

00:15:37.465 --> 00:15:41.475
One of the disciples of this guru told Me
a name has been given

00:15:41.676 --> 00:15:43.377
called as ‘tinga’ [which] means ‘a thumb’ -

00:15:43.578 --> 00:15:45.610
[in India if] you show somebody a thumb,
it is ‘tinga’.

00:15:45.811 --> 00:15:50.799
Just imagine, it’s not even Sanskrit!
I said, “He doesn’t know even Sanskrit,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.813
now he has been found out with six women
around him and he’s got keeps

00:15:56.014 --> 00:16:03.257
and he’s taking what? - Scotch whisky,
all that, he’s busy here.”

00:16:03.458 --> 00:16:06.675
They said, “Still…”

00:16:07.526 --> 00:16:10.346
I said, “Still, how long will you go on
like that?”

00:16:10.547 --> 00:16:14.176
Of course some common sense will come
into them.

00:16:14.377 --> 00:16:21.164
So these things are there, existing,

00:16:21.365 --> 00:16:27.628
but the true ones will understand the true
nature of Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:29.029 --> 00:16:34.988
It is so nice to see all of you here because
we are going to have a very nice 27th.

00:16:35.189 --> 00:16:38.649
Is the day when we are initiating you
as gurus;

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:41.915
that’s the day you will be initiated
as gurus.

00:16:42.116 --> 00:16:46.799
And special powers will be given to you
on that day.

00:16:48.023 --> 00:16:59.094
But our intellect is to be [a] little bit
brought low

00:16:59.524 --> 00:17:05.349
and our heart is to be [a] little bit
raised higher.

00:17:05.954 --> 00:17:12.625
If we could do that, then we’ll be able
to create auspiciousness about us.

00:17:12.826 --> 00:17:18.606
Now I must tell you about auspiciousness.
What is auspicious?

00:17:18.807 --> 00:17:25.442
This word people know: this is not
auspicious, that is not auspicious.

00:17:25.825 --> 00:17:30.059
If you find the horse’s horseshoe, it is
auspicious.

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:35.193
Now do you know, in modern times
the symbol of Sahaja Yoga

00:17:35.394 --> 00:17:39.528
is a horseshoe-shaped: can you imagine?

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:48.014
It has many meanings, but why that shape
is auspicious, people did not know.

00:17:48.215 --> 00:17:53.176
People do not know why a thing is
auspicious and a thing is not auspicious.

00:17:53.377 --> 00:18:00.234
Now this has been in England; for years
people were using horseshoe

00:18:00.435 --> 00:18:05.118
as an auspicious thing and it is, hundred
percent.

00:18:05.319 --> 00:18:12.138
The shape of a horseshoe emits vibrations.
You can see for yourself.

00:18:13.026 --> 00:18:19.047
The shape of that horseshoe is the shape
[of] how The Shakti moves,

00:18:19.248 --> 00:18:27.940
how the power moves, always like this -
what you call? - elliptical, like that.

00:18:28.141 --> 00:18:31.260
It goes to a person, say, if I love this
person

00:18:31.461 --> 00:18:35.859
the vibrations will go like this and
embrace her and then come back.

00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:39.967
The first movement is this way, the first
dimension is like that.

00:18:40.168 --> 00:18:42.943
But this can be [in] three-hundred
and sixty degrees it moves.

00:18:43.139 --> 00:18:48.408
The whole Creation took place by
the movement of the Shakti like this.

00:18:48.609 --> 00:18:51.361
That’s why they sometimes see it parabolic.

00:18:51.562 --> 00:18:54.452
You see, like Einstein has been talking
about it.

00:18:54.653 --> 00:18:58.256
But they see partial truth, not the whole.

00:19:00.408 --> 00:19:07.647
Now, when you have a shape or a form,

00:19:07.848 --> 00:19:13.287
or a kind of [an] assemblage of certain
factors

00:19:13.488 --> 00:19:20.701
in a particular material could be,

00:19:20.902 --> 00:19:28.050
could be a particular tree, could be
a human being,

00:19:28.251 --> 00:19:32.826
then you find from that person -

00:19:33.027 --> 00:19:38.815
only the realised-souls can feel -
vibrations coming.

00:19:41.991 --> 00:19:47.762
Because whatever emits vibration
is auspicious,

00:19:48.414 --> 00:19:55.558
and auspiciousness is the quality by which
we emit vibrations.

00:19:56.116 --> 00:19:59.215
Now purity is a very relative word in
the modern times.

00:19:59.416 --> 00:20:01.217
People don’t understand what is purity.

00:20:01.418 --> 00:20:05.316
I mean, they don’t understand even what
is normal, leave alone purity.

00:20:05.517 --> 00:20:09.342
Everybody seems to be abnormal or
subnormal in modern times.

00:20:09.543 --> 00:20:12.756
Nobody seems to be normal. Even
the psychologists can’t define

00:20:12.957 --> 00:20:19.933
what is normal is. Normal is that which
is auspicious.

00:20:20.134 --> 00:20:24.622
Now this is the knowledge of the beyond.

00:20:24.823 --> 00:20:30.437
With whatever senses you have, you cannot
feel it.

00:20:30.638 --> 00:20:32.995
For example, I went to Stonehenge.

00:20:33.196 --> 00:20:35.682
Now you all know that there’s something
about Stonehenge,

00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:41.082
you know that there’s something about them.
But what about them?

00:20:41.283 --> 00:20:45.903
These are the stones which have come out
of Mother Earth,

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:48.660
which are emitting vibrations.

00:20:48.861 --> 00:20:51.243
And the covering of that has been done
later on,

00:20:51.444 --> 00:20:53.676
some people must have [done that].
They did not understand

00:20:53.877 --> 00:20:56.218
how these stones have come out,
one after another,

00:20:56.419 --> 00:20:59.332
so they must have used [other stones]
to cover it up.

00:20:59.533 --> 00:21:02.041
But if they were saints they would have
said

00:21:02.242 --> 00:21:08.987
that this is a stone which has got
vibrations.

00:21:09.188 --> 00:21:15.605
For example, when we say that we should
not worship any statues in The Bible,

00:21:15.806 --> 00:21:22.515
it’s very correct, because it is said that,
whatever is created by Mother Earth

00:21:22.716 --> 00:21:29.737
or by the sky should not be reproduced.
So Mother Earth is producing something.

00:21:29.938 --> 00:21:33.115
Now ask the Christians what are they
producing.

00:21:33.316 --> 00:21:40.698
What is the element that is the earth is
producing, what is the sky is producing?

00:21:41.684 --> 00:21:43.744
They will not be able to tell you.

00:21:43.945 --> 00:21:48.927
What is this Mother Earth producing which
should not be reproduced?

00:21:49.128 --> 00:21:52.538
Which should not be worshipped?
Means something She is producing

00:21:52.739 --> 00:21:56.742
which should be worshipped and that
should not be reproduced.

00:21:58.425 --> 00:22:04.051
This auspiciousness can only be felt
by people who are realised-souls

00:22:04.252 --> 00:22:07.810
or people who are sensitive
to spirituality.

00:22:08.011 --> 00:22:15.768
Those who are not sensitive to spirituality
cannot feel it. They do not understand.

00:22:15.969 --> 00:22:23.505
They may like a person very much,
“Because I like!” But why?

00:22:23.706 --> 00:22:27.662
Why do you like a person very much and
you do not like another person?

00:22:27.863 --> 00:22:32.865
That person may be any type, they will
say, “No, we like him!”

00:22:33.066 --> 00:22:36.250
But children - not all, but many children -

00:22:36.451 --> 00:22:40.974
can feel the auspiciousness. Dogs can
feel it,

00:22:41.175 --> 00:22:48.825
rats can feel it, snakes can feel it,
tigers can feel it, lions can feel it,

00:22:48.994 --> 00:22:53.451
but human beings are rather difficult.

00:22:53.652 --> 00:22:59.099
Horses can feel it. Horses feel it very
much.

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:08.167
If you take them near a, say, a place where
there are [dead] spirits

00:23:08.368 --> 00:23:12.495
or, we can say, some sort of a burial
ground,

00:23:12.696 --> 00:23:17.838
they would not like to go down there much.
First they would resist.

00:23:19.752 --> 00:23:23.820
But gradually they also get used to it;
same with dogs.

00:23:24.021 --> 00:23:29.492
They can feel it: a man who is a realised-
soul, who is not a realised-soul.

00:23:29.693 --> 00:23:34.863
They can even feel an evil person.
They are very sensitive.

00:23:36.857 --> 00:23:40.190
A dog can always feel a saint.

00:23:40.391 --> 00:23:45.339
Even a mad dog can be controlled
by a saint.

00:23:46.452 --> 00:23:51.408
This auspiciousness, the feeling
of auspiciousness,

00:23:52.101 --> 00:23:56.705
can be felt through heart: it’s the feeling
from the heart,

00:23:56.906 --> 00:24:03.595
not from the brain, not from the ego
or superego:

00:24:03.796 --> 00:24:07.061
means either we get ideas from our ego

00:24:07.262 --> 00:24:11.581
or from our superego, from our
conditioning.

00:24:11.782 --> 00:24:17.853
But if our heart is alive, which is a very
rare thing nowadays...

00:24:18.054 --> 00:24:24.367
most of us have got hearts like - ‘frozen’
I would not say -

00:24:24.568 --> 00:24:28.520
[but] like Rock of Gibraltar.

00:24:28.721 --> 00:24:33.874
Because frozen can be, you see, can be
defrosted.

00:24:38.463 --> 00:24:43.153
So such a heart, Rock of Gibraltar,
is living here, you see.

00:24:43.354 --> 00:24:45.572
And you meet another person and you feel

00:24:45.773 --> 00:24:48.925
the another is going to just bang on you
with that Rock of Gibraltar.

00:24:49.126 --> 00:24:52.886
I don’t know if you have visited Rock
of Gibraltar any time. I have.

00:24:53.087 --> 00:24:59.292
One day we were plying on a ship, you see,
and suddenly our ship stopped

00:24:59.493 --> 00:25:05.067
and what I found is a huge big promontory.
I said, “What sort of a thing it is?”

00:25:05.268 --> 00:25:09.069
Because no ship can go near any rock,
that near,

00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:15.687
because no rock is that steep to give
that much draft for the ship.

00:25:15.888 --> 00:25:20.636
And this was just like this in front.
I said, “What sort of a rock is this?”

00:25:20.837 --> 00:25:23.978
They said, “This is Rock of Gibraltar!”

00:25:24.179 --> 00:25:29.319
I was looking at it: absolutely a solid
piece, you see,

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:33.441
and you thought it is going to hit you
on your head.

00:25:33.642 --> 00:25:36.398
Something like that [when] human beings
become,

00:25:36.599 --> 00:25:40.448
how can you feel the auspiciousness?
It’s a very sensitive thing:

00:25:40.649 --> 00:25:44.666
extremely sensitive and delicate.

00:25:44.867 --> 00:25:51.336
All the delicacy of the heart, I don’t know
where it is gone.

00:25:52.299 --> 00:25:58.189
Like Lord Byron’s style. Look at him,
what a life he had.

00:25:58.392 --> 00:26:02.158
He made everyone miserable in his
private life,

00:26:02.366 --> 00:26:05.948
and in his poetry he made everybody cry;

00:26:06.149 --> 00:26:11.483
took out their eyes, washed them, again
put them back in the sockets!

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:20.314
I mean, he was a very great sadist, I felt.
Horrible!

00:26:20.515 --> 00:26:25.429
He could not write anything beautiful,
he could not see anything beautiful,

00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:31.147
he could not say anything that was
pleasant.

00:26:31.522 --> 00:26:34.519
And people, I have seen, have wept
and wept and wept

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:40.123
and this fellow was enjoying having
a nice time somewhere!

00:26:43.184 --> 00:26:47.185
It’s nice to laugh it out, because we had
two patients

00:26:47.386 --> 00:26:52.287
who read only Lord Byron and were
gone cases!

00:26:55.084 --> 00:26:58.891
You don’t know, in England I get such
cases, some samples!

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:02.715
He is no more here so I can tell you
about him.

00:27:02.916 --> 00:27:05.296
He used to just weep and weep and weep.

00:27:05.497 --> 00:27:08.707
And then we didn’t do anything with him
here,

00:27:08.908 --> 00:27:11.463
we couldn’t do much. I told him, “Why are
you weeping?”, you see,

00:27:11.664 --> 00:27:17.099
and then I discovered he was a patient
created by Lord Byron!

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:25.199
I told him not to take this poet very
seriously, and forget about it!

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:28.416
He was just doing it to sell his books!

00:27:28.617 --> 00:27:32.244
But the fellow couldn’t get rid of it, you
see, always he used to get into that mood,

00:27:32.445 --> 00:27:36.336
and very serious mood and this and that.
Then we sent him home.

00:27:36.537 --> 00:27:40.457
I sent some Sahaja Yogis to his mother,
father: very nice people, I must say.

00:27:40.658 --> 00:27:42.987
They talked to Me on the phone:
very good people.

00:27:43.188 --> 00:27:45.757
They said, “Mother, if you say, we’ll keep
him in the house.”

00:27:45.958 --> 00:27:50.191
He’s a big man, he’s a big man about thirty
years of age, you know.

00:27:50.392 --> 00:27:54.664
And third day the mother said, “I’d better
chuck him out of the house, Mother.”

00:27:54.865 --> 00:27:58.277
I said, “Why, where will he go?” She said,
“He is still doing the same thing.

00:27:58.478 --> 00:28:01.416
He is in the room. I have to serve
him food.

00:28:01.617 --> 00:28:07.001
I have to wash his things and he is just
sitting and weeping there.”

00:28:10.177 --> 00:28:14.389
So because, you see, the sensitivity is
lost. Whom are you giving your heart?

00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:18.870
To this Lord Byron of all the persons?

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:24.742
This is the problem with us: we do not know
who is auspicious.

00:28:24.943 --> 00:28:27.999
For example, Blake people won’t like.
I mean the one

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:34.348
who is the poet you have really, I would
say, after Shakespeare.

00:28:36.724 --> 00:28:40.147
I wonder if Shakespeare was one man
or many people put together.

00:28:40.348 --> 00:28:45.399
But Blake was the poet you had,
the greatest of all I would say.

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:49.619
There were so many, also others. Wordsworth
was another.

00:28:49.827 --> 00:28:52.519
You can see [that] those who talk
of charming things,

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:57.279
of pleasant things, and beautiful things
are the poets,

00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:01.257
not these garbage cleaners.

00:29:01.734 --> 00:29:06.227
What is wrong with us that we cannot
make out

00:29:06.428 --> 00:29:11.948
between the stink and the fragrance?

00:29:12.321 --> 00:29:18.238
Auspiciousness is the way we emit our
fragrance to others.

00:29:18.619 --> 00:29:20.898
For example the other day two boys got
Realisation

00:29:21.099 --> 00:29:24.245
and all the Sahaja Yogis ran just to feel
their vibrations

00:29:24.429 --> 00:29:27.333
and the rest were left behind. Because
they were enjoying the person,

00:29:27.534 --> 00:29:30.414
the vibrations of that person. Then
I shouted at them, I said,

00:29:30.615 --> 00:29:33.828
“All right, now you have enjoyed, now go
and see others also are there!”

00:29:34.029 --> 00:29:36.339
And they would not go near somebody
you see,

00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:39.013
who was thinking he was a great man
sitting down there.

00:29:39.214 --> 00:29:43.010
Nobody would go near them. They were
holding their ears sitting here.

00:29:43.211 --> 00:29:47.585
Then everybody avoiding to go to that man.
And the fellow must be feeling miserable,

00:29:47.786 --> 00:29:51.003
I know that, but I went to him and worked
it out.

00:29:51.204 --> 00:29:56.540
But then I found that he was doing
something very, very wrong himself.

00:29:56.741 --> 00:30:00.162
And he said, “Mother, I am not evil.”
I said, “No, it’s not evil,

00:30:00.363 --> 00:30:05.730
but whatever you have done is evil!
Is to play into these spirits,

00:30:05.931 --> 00:30:10.460
call them down, put on people and this.
Is an evil thing to do.”

00:30:10.661 --> 00:30:13.169
“I did not know, Mother.” I said,
“All right.

00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:16.646
It’s all right, if you did not know, it can
be forgiven.”

00:30:16.847 --> 00:30:21.452
But this is what auspiciousness is: that
you to feel it from your heart

00:30:21.653 --> 00:30:26.265
which is awakened. The heart must be
awakened.

00:30:26.689 --> 00:30:31.261
In the heart resides the Spirit,

00:30:32.364 --> 00:30:36.796
which is not yet flowing in our
consciousness,

00:30:36.997 --> 00:30:45.766
in our central nervous system.
It resides there, the joy itself.

00:30:47.047 --> 00:30:51.245
I don’t know if you have ever seen
phosphorus taken out of the water

00:30:51.446 --> 00:30:57.080
and how it just gets ignited -

00:30:57.281 --> 00:31:04.112
it is like that: inside the maya,
the illusion, that spark is sitting down,

00:31:04.313 --> 00:31:09.267
and when this Kundalini rises and touches
that spark,

00:31:09.468 --> 00:31:14.851
it starts emitting its joy,
its auspiciousness.

00:31:15.052 --> 00:31:17.202
Unless and until you have that within you,

00:31:17.403 --> 00:31:22.081
you cannot feel the auspiciousness
of others.

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:26.737
Take a coconut, for example:

00:31:26.938 --> 00:31:31.445
put it the other way round, you won’t
get vibrations.

00:31:32.338 --> 00:31:37.720
If you put it this way [with] the coconut
coming up you will get more vibrations.

00:31:37.921 --> 00:31:41.557
There are certain coconuts who give you
very good vibrations,

00:31:41.758 --> 00:31:44.909
some give horrible vibrations.

00:31:46.466 --> 00:31:51.422
And you know human beings also have
coconuts!

00:31:54.525 --> 00:32:01.909
Some of the coconuts give such beautiful
vibrations and some of them do not.

00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:04.707
Some of them are tired.

00:32:04.908 --> 00:32:13.131
Some of them are nothing but like
a balloon of Mr Ego.

00:32:13.746 --> 00:32:16.951
Or some of them have nothing but superego
in them.

00:32:17.152 --> 00:32:22.710
So this coconut is to be made auspicious.

00:32:22.911 --> 00:32:30.708
Now, how it is connected with Spirit,
that is a very important point:

00:32:30.909 --> 00:32:35.748
how our brain is connected with Spirit.

00:32:35.949 --> 00:32:40.325
Whatever I am telling you, you need not
believe Me,

00:32:40.526 --> 00:32:46.855
but you will find it out for yourself that,
whatever I am saying is the Truth.

00:32:47.396 --> 00:32:52.180
Your heart has the Spirit, the light,

00:32:52.381 --> 00:32:59.299
and the heart has got seven auras
around it.

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:11.538
And these seven auras get enlightened
by the Spirit.

00:33:13.126 --> 00:33:22.286
But before that it’s a very instantaneous
or we can say a simultaneous happening.

00:33:22.487 --> 00:33:26.588
When the Kundalini rises there are seven
centres

00:33:26.789 --> 00:33:30.427
also in our brain, in the sense [that]
there are the seats of the centres.

00:33:30.628 --> 00:33:36.438
These seven centres are represented again
on the seat, you know that very well.

00:33:36.639 --> 00:33:40.505
All the Sahaja Yogis know where they are.

00:33:41.559 --> 00:33:51.702
So when these centres are enlightened,
the auras start shining in the heart.

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:59.705
And this centre (Brahmarandhra) is actually
the seat of the Spirit.

00:33:59.906 --> 00:34:03.488
The Spirit has moved from there and
has gone to the heart:

00:34:03.689 --> 00:34:07.727
that’s why in childhood you will find
there’s an opening here.

00:34:07.928 --> 00:34:16.144
It’s a very soft bone, called as fontanelle
bone, talu, is here.

00:34:16.345 --> 00:34:20.682
Because the Spirit comes out from there
and is settled on the heart.

00:34:20.883 --> 00:34:26.902
You know, Spirit also comes out in the
night sometimes, goes round and sees.

00:34:27.103 --> 00:34:34.588
It’s so. When these centres in our brain
get enlightened by Kundalini,

00:34:34.789 --> 00:34:41.311
one by one, first they are enlightened
here, then in the brain,

00:34:41.512 --> 00:34:46.289
then the auras in the heart start getting
enlightened.

00:34:46.490 --> 00:34:54.136
Ultimately when this centre - which is
the centre of the heart here,

00:34:54.337 --> 00:34:58.626
Sahastrara, in this point -

00:35:00.674 --> 00:35:11.186
when this one gets enlightened, then
the Spirit also gets enlightened, fully;

00:35:11.387 --> 00:35:18.043
and then these auras become doubly shining.

00:35:19.388 --> 00:35:26.645
Then the auspiciousness is in many
dimensions starts expressing itself.

00:35:27.196 --> 00:35:33.954
But to keep that light on, one has to keep
the Kundalini over here.

00:35:37.253 --> 00:35:44.521
Then what happens? Then we are ruled
by our heart’s indication

00:35:44.722 --> 00:35:51.060
[rather] than by our brain. How?
Because the heart has the Spirit,

00:35:51.261 --> 00:35:56.536
which emits vibrations, it’s not the brain.

00:35:57.372 --> 00:36:01.963
And you depend on your vibratory awareness
after Realisation.

00:36:02.164 --> 00:36:04.828
The more you depend on your vibratory
awareness,

00:36:05.029 --> 00:36:10.498
the more you use your heart, your Spirit,
not your brain.

00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:15.648
The more you use your brain, again you
go down,

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:18.461
because it is taken over now by the Spirit.

00:36:18.662 --> 00:36:22.311
For example: after Realisation when you
start thinking about it…

00:36:22.512 --> 00:36:25.372
I mean, people can think of anything!
I mean, I can tell you,

00:36:25.573 --> 00:36:29.265
I have had such experiences that they
would think that,

00:36:29.466 --> 00:36:31.240
“Why Mataji is wearing a sari like this?”

00:36:31.441 --> 00:36:35.140
Even to this extent you see they can
go [to]!

00:36:35.341 --> 00:36:39.362
But if you can just leave your heart
to work it out and don’t think,

00:36:39.563 --> 00:36:41.805
because you are in thoughtless awareness
after Realisation.

00:36:42.006 --> 00:36:43.773
If you try to maintain that state,

00:36:43.974 --> 00:36:48.529
pay attention to your heart and let your
Spirit emit itself,

00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:55.976
so that it clears out completely the
confusion of the brain and everything;

00:36:56.192 --> 00:37:01.119
then you will be amazed that you cannot
lose your vibrations.

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:04.919
You cannot lose your Realisation.

00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:09.791
The simplest way is - I mean, we have
found like this -

00:37:09.992 --> 00:37:14.483
that after Realisation if you go for seven
days treatment

00:37:14.684 --> 00:37:17.296
with soaking feet before My photograph
it works out.

00:37:17.497 --> 00:37:21.276
But immediately when I say,
“My photograph”: finished!

00:37:21.477 --> 00:37:28.076
The ego comes up: “Why her photograph?”
First thing comes up: “Who is She?”

00:37:28.277 --> 00:37:32.195
I may be nothing - all right, agreed,
I am nothing -

00:37:32.396 --> 00:37:37.531
but I have raised your Kundalini! I have
given you Realisation!

00:37:37.732 --> 00:37:41.589
I must be something after all.

00:37:44.405 --> 00:37:50.309
So why worry? I am not taking away anything
from you.

00:37:51.299 --> 00:37:57.970
Then you start establishing your
auspiciousness, the sense of auspiciousness.

00:37:58.171 --> 00:38:03.836
Once you have established it, then you
do not lose it very easily.

00:38:04.037 --> 00:38:06.667
You don’t like then inauspicious things,
normally.

00:38:06.868 --> 00:38:11.935
If there is somebody inauspicious you say,
“Mother, no.

00:38:12.136 --> 00:38:15.255
We can’t do anything about this gentleman”.
All right.

00:38:15.456 --> 00:38:20.884
Afterwards when you become very strong you
don’t mind working on anyone whatsoever.

00:38:21.085 --> 00:38:24.815
But gradually you have to grow up to it.
I understand that.

00:38:25.016 --> 00:38:29.321
But I can’t understand people using their
rationality to understand Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:29.522 --> 00:38:39.715
How can you understand this great power
with your limited rationality?

00:38:39.916 --> 00:38:47.189
I can explain to an ant about your
politics,

00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:54.025
but I cannot tell you how this divine power
works.

00:38:57.401 --> 00:39:09.169
One day he asked Me, Djamel, numerically:
to what extent it goes, to what dimension?

00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:12.266
And when I told him he said,
“It is incalculable.”

00:39:12.467 --> 00:39:15.695
I said, “It is an infinite! You cannot
calculate.”

00:39:15.896 --> 00:39:22.360
If you put two mirrors facing each other
and put some object in between,

00:39:22.561 --> 00:39:32.271
you cannot calculate how many reflections
you will get.

00:39:32.472 --> 00:39:35.149
Even that you see, but you cannot
calculate.

00:39:35.350 --> 00:39:42.605
But here I am talking about something that
does that, which creates these things.

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:52.160
You cannot calculate all the molecules
and the atoms of one element,

00:39:52.361 --> 00:39:55.675
but I am talking about Somebody who has
created them

00:39:55.876 --> 00:40:01.744
and who, in every molecule, pulsates.

00:40:03.931 --> 00:40:08.026
How can you understand with this brain?

00:40:08.346 --> 00:40:11.795
You can only become one with It and enjoy
yourself! Why worry?

00:40:11.996 --> 00:40:16.117
Why do you want to count the molecules?

00:40:18.643 --> 00:40:21.837
Why this madness?

00:40:24.195 --> 00:40:32.324
It would be like a madman going to
the seashore to have a nice bath,

00:40:32.525 --> 00:40:41.850
starts counting the small little pebbles
and the grains of the sand.

00:40:42.854 --> 00:40:47.585
Get in! Enjoy! You become that.

00:40:47.786 --> 00:40:54.118
This is advaita, where you become one.
All religions teach advaita.

00:40:54.319 --> 00:40:58.936
Advaita means where there is not
the other, ananya.

00:40:59.137 --> 00:41:03.614
You become one with that. With the whole
ocean you become one.

00:41:03.815 --> 00:41:09.441
[When] a drop becomes the ocean, all the
powers of the oceans are there for the drop.

00:41:09.642 --> 00:41:12.081
That’s what it is.

00:41:14.083 --> 00:41:17.418
But there are some people who say,
“We believe in dvaita (duality),

00:41:17.619 --> 00:41:23.127
No, why, we don’t want to get lost.”
Then you are not lost!

00:41:23.328 --> 00:41:26.538
You become the whole!

00:41:27.651 --> 00:41:30.773
But they want to keep their small
limitations, you see.

00:41:30.974 --> 00:41:35.812
Now what is that small limitation they
want to keep?

00:41:38.031 --> 00:41:44.494
It’s called as Mr E-G-O,

00:41:47.314 --> 00:41:53.934
which is a myth, which is a myth.
It’s such a big myth this ego:

00:41:54.135 --> 00:41:58.911
because what do you do, human beings?
Let’s see now.

00:41:59.278 --> 00:42:03.098
What do you do? You make a chair,
all right.

00:42:03.299 --> 00:42:07.135
[You] see, people are even proud if they
can make a chair these days,

00:42:07.336 --> 00:42:09.844
because nobody can use their hands these
days, you know that,

00:42:10.045 --> 00:42:12.927
with everything done by machines.

00:42:13.128 --> 00:42:18.768
I don’t know, they cannot create human
beings, otherwise they may try that also.

00:42:19.898 --> 00:42:25.809
So what do you do? You create something
dead out of dead.

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:30.647
Everything is dead. Whatever you have
created is dead!

00:42:32.448 --> 00:42:35.554
Have you done any living work? So one
lady got very angry with Me.

00:42:35.755 --> 00:42:38.000
She said, “Yes, we have created a tube
baby.”

00:42:38.201 --> 00:42:42.245
I said, “You have not created,
it was all there. The life was there.

00:42:42.446 --> 00:42:45.715
You just brought it together and it worked
out that way. It’s nothing!”

00:42:45.916 --> 00:42:50.384
It’s just like [an] egg being -

00:42:50.585 --> 00:42:54.946
what do you say that? Egg that put
in the - incubator.

00:42:55.347 --> 00:42:57.735
It is that! [A] simple thing! You have done
nothing!

00:42:57.936 --> 00:43:01.313
You have put life into it, have you?

00:43:01.514 --> 00:43:06.223
Let us confess it now. We cannot convert
even one flower,

00:43:06.424 --> 00:43:12.526
transform one flower into a fruit.
Let us admit it.

00:43:13.105 --> 00:43:16.668
So what is this ego, then? “I do this
and I do this,”

00:43:16.869 --> 00:43:21.549
“I would like that and I would have this”
and “I, I, I.”

00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:27.619
Who is this ‘Mr I’ who cannot do one living
thing?

00:43:29.884 --> 00:43:34.095
Just ask yourself. [It’s a] very simple
question.

00:43:34.526 --> 00:43:40.457
So, you reach a conclusion, it’s a myth!
We do not do anything!

00:43:40.658 --> 00:43:43.615
As many times I have told you that,
some people going by train

00:43:43.816 --> 00:43:45.829
put all their luggage on their heads.

00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:48.567
So they said, “Why are you carrying
so much luggage on your head?”

00:43:48.768 --> 00:43:54.654
They said, “Because we want to reduce
the weight of the train.”

00:43:57.637 --> 00:44:01.564
This ego is like that: put it on your head!
“I do it! I do it! I do it!”

00:44:01.765 --> 00:44:06.888
But by brainwashing you I cannot reduce it.
How [then]?

00:44:07.089 --> 00:44:10.741
The myth has to be broken.

00:44:11.861 --> 00:44:16.267
The myth breaks when Kundalini rises.

00:44:16.468 --> 00:44:19.912
Then how you talk is a very different
language:

00:44:20.113 --> 00:44:24.869
“It is not coming.” “It is not going.”
It is ‘it’. It becomes a third person.

00:44:25.070 --> 00:44:27.523
Then your power, which is flowing through
your hands,

00:44:27.724 --> 00:44:30.606
you see that going through your hands,
which you are manoeuvring.

00:44:30.807 --> 00:44:35.348
You don’t say, “I am giving you Realisation!”
you don’t say.

00:44:35.549 --> 00:44:38.921
You just say, “It is going.” “It is rising.”
“It is not coming.”

00:44:39.122 --> 00:44:44.393
Even if it is your son you will say,
“I cannot give, now what to do?”

00:44:44.724 --> 00:44:47.621
Like a lady came with Me to America
once and

00:44:47.822 --> 00:44:51.138
she was very anxious that I must give
Realisation to her son and all that.

00:44:51.339 --> 00:44:57.161
So I told her, “Look at this. Now you have
come all the way, I know, for this purpose.

00:44:57.362 --> 00:45:01.374
But now if the Kundalini doesn’t rise,
should you want Me to say

00:45:01.575 --> 00:45:03.894
that he is realised?” “No, no, no, no,
Mataji, I know it doesn’t rise.”

00:45:04.095 --> 00:45:07.897
Then I said, “You give him a Realisation.
I cannot give him. All right, you try.”

00:45:08.098 --> 00:45:10.711
Then, “But it doesn’t rise!” I said,
“Then what to do?

00:45:10.912 --> 00:45:14.347
If the Kundalini is not coming up, what
can we do about it?”

00:45:14.548 --> 00:45:19.912
So, the Kundalini has to come
spontaneously. It’s a living process.

00:45:20.113 --> 00:45:25.060
But after Realisation you start doing
living things.

00:45:26.229 --> 00:45:31.281
You can raise the Kundalini. You can
pulsate the Kundalini.

00:45:31.482 --> 00:45:35.084
I don’t know about pulsation: so far I have
not seen any Sahaja Yogi doing it.

00:45:35.285 --> 00:45:40.198
But you can raise it all right. You can
give Realisation:

00:45:40.399 --> 00:45:44.490
with My photograph it works better.

00:45:44.691 --> 00:45:50.031
You can give vibrations now to the plants,
to the fruit,

00:45:50.232 --> 00:45:57.234
or to any, any flower like this. If it is
dying, it will come to life.

00:45:57.435 --> 00:46:04.297
If you give vibrations say, to a field of,
or seeds of, say wheat,

00:46:04.498 --> 00:46:10.394
they can be multiplied: they can be ten
times more than what they were.

00:46:10.595 --> 00:46:18.266
Now you have started giving vibrations
to the trees, to the people,

00:46:18.467 --> 00:46:24.985
you are doing the living work. Now you
have become the ocean of life.

00:46:25.186 --> 00:46:30.308
So far you were not. Because the power
of life

00:46:30.509 --> 00:46:35.053
[which] is to give life, has come in you.

00:46:38.321 --> 00:46:44.567
Now you are living. Before this you were
dead,

00:46:44.768 --> 00:46:49.780
in the sense that you were worshipping
a dead god called ‘ego’,

00:46:49.981 --> 00:46:54.728
now it’s the living God within you -
is the Spirit.

00:46:55.023 --> 00:47:00.608
Once you start accepting your Spirit,
all your priorities change just like that,

00:47:00.809 --> 00:47:04.598
because Spirit is joy and happiness.

00:47:04.799 --> 00:47:10.718
Spirit is everything, so you start losing
all your interest into other things.

00:47:10.919 --> 00:47:17.577
If this is what is, then your auspiciousness
is of the greatest height,

00:47:17.778 --> 00:47:23.782
that even your name can create something
great,

00:47:24.010 --> 00:47:27.224
and photograph can do wonders.

00:47:27.425 --> 00:47:34.725
If you become auspiciousness, you are
the holiest of the holy.

00:47:35.163 --> 00:47:41.301
For that we have to get rid of some
of the dirt and the dust,

00:47:41.502 --> 00:47:45.569
we have to get rid of some of the false
notions we have and the myths of being -

00:47:45.770 --> 00:47:48.530
some people have a myth that they
are guilty and some people,

00:47:48.731 --> 00:47:54.534
as I told you, have so many myths. But
for giving up, this Kundalini works out.

00:47:54.735 --> 00:48:00.654
You allow Her to work it out, that’s all.
It works.

00:48:00.855 --> 00:48:03.982
It has worked with so many from England

00:48:04.183 --> 00:48:08.683
and I am very proud of My Sahaja Yogis
of England.

00:48:08.884 --> 00:48:12.743
If anybody asks Me, “Where do you find
the best young people?”

00:48:12.944 --> 00:48:15.662
I said, “It’s in England”. Most surprising!

00:48:15.884 --> 00:48:20.968
They are not racialists, they are not all
this nonsense of being fanatics, nothing.

00:48:21.178 --> 00:48:25.440
Except for druggists and chemists they are.

00:48:27.347 --> 00:48:32.028
That also due to mistakes. But that I can
correct.

00:48:32.229 --> 00:48:40.880
But most of them are beautiful people,
very sincere, very honest, very good.

00:48:41.081 --> 00:48:50.244
Because England is the heart, is the heart
of the universe, of the world.

00:48:50.445 --> 00:48:54.346
Whatever happens in England gets known
all over the world.

00:48:54.547 --> 00:48:57.044
You know these people had this siege
(at the Iranian Embassy on 30/4/1980);

00:48:57.245 --> 00:49:01.144
today I read in the paper they were giving
an explanation about it,

00:49:01.345 --> 00:49:05.253
that, "We did it in England, not because
we wanted to kill anybody or anything,

00:49:05.454 --> 00:49:07.790
but we wanted to talk to British
government,

00:49:07.979 --> 00:49:13.271
so that if anything happens in London
it will be known all over the world.”

00:49:13.472 --> 00:49:21.610
People still think that British are still
the sanest people in the West.

00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:25.131
Still they think like that, which is
the truth.

00:49:25.332 --> 00:49:31.646
So, we have a very good group of people
here, this has to expand.

00:49:31.847 --> 00:49:34.559
You have to find out more and more
who are seekers.

00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:38.224
But don’t tell them just now that you have
to give up any one of their

00:49:38.425 --> 00:49:41.798
druggists-chemists business, because if
you tell them then they will run away.

00:49:41.999 --> 00:49:44.858
We made a mistake like this, I know that.

00:49:45.059 --> 00:49:49.927
No, they will just give up, you don’t
worry. Let them come.

00:49:50.826 --> 00:49:56.967
Because once they have found it, even if
you tell them [to], they will not go there.

00:49:57.168 --> 00:50:00.655
Let them join. Let them come.

00:50:00.876 --> 00:50:06.778
By your auspiciousness, by your vibrations
and the fragrance of the flowers,

00:50:06.979 --> 00:50:13.031
let all the bees start hovering, knowing
that there is the scent

00:50:13.232 --> 00:50:17.885
of the beautiful nectar hidden
under these petals.

00:50:18.086 --> 00:50:22.809
I am sure all of them will come and one day

00:50:23.010 --> 00:50:31.094
from England we’ll have the real spiritual
upsurge for the whole world.

00:50:31.295 --> 00:50:34.413
May God bless you.
