1
00:00:06,796 --> 00:00:12,866
I was not very much interested in the studies
but I used to do very well but I used to read

2
00:00:12,866 --> 00:00:18,908
lives of great men and things like that.
At a very young age, I read Bernard Shaw.

3
00:00:19,568 --> 00:00:24,168
When people were reading just 'Great
Expectations', I was reading Bernard Shaw.

4
00:00:24,694 --> 00:00:29,464
But as such, I didn't have interest in
particularly reading some text books

5
00:00:29,464 --> 00:00:34,082
because I thought, they were childish and
there's nothing to be read about it.

6
00:00:34,471 --> 00:00:38,091
Then, I told My father that, "I have
to do Medicine." So, he said, "Why?"

7
00:00:38,091 --> 00:00:40,321
I said, "Because I have to talk to
doctors."

8
00:00:40,461 --> 00:00:45,945
He said, "You have to talk to doctors?"
"Yes," I said, but it so happened in My

9
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:51,556
childhood, when I was about 7 years of
age - My father was a Congressman. He had

10
00:00:51,556 --> 00:00:56,288
joined Congress when I was 4 years of 
age; He used to live with a style, very

11
00:00:56,288 --> 00:01:01,225
Westernized. His clothes were stitched in
London, sort of a man - we had governesses

12
00:01:01,225 --> 00:01:06,836
and all that - he threw away everything
and he became a real Indian and started

13
00:01:06,836 --> 00:01:16,893
leading a life of a martyr. Then, he made
us study our languages Sanskrit. He made

14
00:01:16,893 --> 00:01:21,445
Me study in an Indian school - not in a
missionary school - because missionaries

15
00:01:21,445 --> 00:01:26,096
were very unkind. They threw us out of the
school when My father was in the Congress

16
00:01:26,096 --> 00:01:31,743
- they were against us completely.
Then, at the age of 7 years I

17
00:01:31,948 --> 00:01:40,418
happened to go with My father to Mahatma
Gandhi. He was about 70 miles living with

18
00:01:40,418 --> 00:01:44,788
us but the first time he took Me down and
Mahatma Gandhi liked Me very much.

19
00:01:44,788 --> 00:01:49,548
He said, "Leave this child with me." So,
I had not even taken clothes or anything,

20
00:01:49,548 --> 00:01:57,433
I stayed on, then My father sent Me everything,
with him and he was very fond of Me but I

21
00:01:57,433 --> 00:02:02,175
was a little girl but he understood that
there was something about Me. He consulted

22
00:02:02,175 --> 00:02:09,466
Me on very serious problems sometimes,
surprisingly. Like, one day he wanted to

23
00:02:09,466 --> 00:02:15,593
make the Prayer Book alright, so he asked
Me, "How should I put the series and all that."

24
00:02:15,882 --> 00:02:22,362
So, I told Me how to put the series and he
put the series in that way. I used to go

25
00:02:22,362 --> 00:02:29,213
back for My school and again go back to
Gandhiji every year, like that and he

26
00:02:29,213 --> 00:02:34,398
called Me Nepali - he gave Me a name Nepali.
Everybody used to call Me Nepali that time.

27
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:42,830
Then I grew up with him very intimately; He
was a very, very kind person for children

28
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:47,908
otherwise an extremely strict man with
himself and with others, very strict - a big

29
00:02:47,908 --> 00:02:54,307
disciplinarian - and he would make everybody
get up at 4 0'clock, have your baths, everything,

30
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:59,526
be ready for your morning prayers at 5 0'clock,
you see and he used to walk very fast;

31
00:02:59,526 --> 00:03:05,272
I also learnt walking fast with him. In
his company you had to walk fast and very

32
00:03:05,272 --> 00:03:10,124
extremely loving and a very nice person
and he would listen to Me because I was

33
00:03:10,124 --> 00:03:14,208
a child, you see. Supposing, I forced him
to eat more or something, then he wouldn't

34
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:19,762
laugh, he would accept - very, kindly
person but with others he was very strict

35
00:03:19,762 --> 00:03:25,031
and I used to tell him that, "Why are you
strict with everyone?" He said, "But you

36
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:28,124
are a little girl, You get up in the
morning time, why can't they get up?"

37
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:31,517
I said, "I'm little that's why I get up,
they're big so they can't get up,"

38
00:03:31,517 --> 00:03:37,837
like that, you see, little chats and then
My father went to jail and My mother also

39
00:03:37,837 --> 00:03:43,263
went to jail five times. My father went to jail
twice - once for about two and a half years and

40
00:03:43,271 --> 00:03:49,181
he was the only supporting member of the
family. By the way, we come from a very old

41
00:03:49,181 --> 00:03:56,955
royal family, which is called as Shalivahanas;
They have a calendar also in India and then

42
00:03:56,955 --> 00:04:04,599
when we, I mean, when they took My father
to jail, we had to leave our house and we

43
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:10,323
had to live in huts and in all problems
- that was nothing - but also Me, they

44
00:04:10,323 --> 00:04:15,212
pestered a lot because I helped many people
there and I joined the '42 movement in a very

45
00:04:15,212 --> 00:04:19,204
serious way and I became the leader here for
the young people. I thought unless and until

46
00:04:19,204 --> 00:04:27,372
I take a very positive stand, it may not
work out with them. It's not gracious to say

47
00:04:27,372 --> 00:04:32,670
how they tortured Me, what they did to Me
but they really tortured Me; I was a young

48
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:39,710
girl of 19 years that time. It's over now,
so it's finished and after that we

49
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:47,974
My father went to jail again and then when he
came back, he got elected as the Member of the

50
00:04:47,974 --> 00:04:54,844
Central Assembly, later on, as the Constituent
Assembly and then of the Parliament. My brother

51
00:04:54,844 --> 00:05:01,310
was also a Member of the Parliament later
on. Now recently, he was the Minister

52
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:09,008
in the cabinet. Another brother is a High
Court judge in Bombay. They're all doing

53
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:14,014
well despite the fact that our parents
neglected us, in a way, because they gave

54
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:19,109
their lives for the country but, you see,
that never deter us from studies and

55
00:05:19,109 --> 00:05:24,672
we came up very well. Then I, when I was
in '42 movement, you see, My college

56
00:05:24,672 --> 00:05:30,517
rusticated Me. From the college they threw
Me out and I had to go to another college

57
00:05:30,517 --> 00:05:39,705
to study far away from My house, in Punjab,
where I studied for two years, Science I did,

58
00:05:39,705 --> 00:05:47,483
then I did My Medical. I didn't do fully
because just after that the '47 riots

59
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:51,850
broke out, so our college was closed and
I didn't want to know more because what I

60
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:56,899
wanted to know, I came to know about it,
so I did not need and I got married.

61
00:05:58,392 --> 00:06:04,162
You must have heard, My husband is now the
Secretary General of the International Maritime Organization.

62
00:06:04,242 --> 00:06:11,082
He held a very high positions. He was also
Secretary to Lal Bahadur Shastri, who was

63
00:06:11,082 --> 00:06:15,438
our Prime Minister, who was another very
great man but he did not survive long.

64
00:06:15,438 --> 00:06:19,534
If he had survived, things would have
been different, I think for our country

65
00:06:19,534 --> 00:06:26,987
because he was a Gandhian, out and out
Gandhian and he lived like an ideal
Gandhian personality.
