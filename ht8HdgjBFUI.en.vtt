WEBVTT

00:02.477 --> 00:06.255
[A little child calls loudly:
“Mataji! Jai!”.]

00:12.130 --> 00:20.953
Today's puja we have arranged of Durga
or the Kali.

00:21.326 --> 00:30.301
That is the destroying form of the Goddess
of all the evil and negativity.

00:30.502 --> 00:34.719
This we had to do it in France,

00:34.920 --> 00:43.128
because I feel very strongly that day
by day, in general,

00:43.329 --> 00:48.185
France is going down and down and down.

00:48.386 --> 00:50.673
While you people are coming up,

00:50.874 --> 00:56.036
the rest of the France is in the most
pitiable condition.

00:56.237 --> 01:02.178
Firstly, as you understand, is the Catholic
church,

01:02.379 --> 01:07.564
which - perhaps you are not aware of,
perhaps maybe -

01:07.765 --> 01:13.054
because you don't read any other languages,

01:13.255 --> 01:19.004
you just read French compulsorily
by this country.

01:19.205 --> 01:26.496
So you have no international views
or international news

01:26.697 --> 01:35.029
that this Catholic church has done
so many horrible things in the past,

01:35.230 --> 01:40.959
that is unbelievable that they have
anything to do with God.

01:41.160 --> 01:51.192
They burnt many cardinals in the hearth -
roasted them.

01:54.082 --> 01:58.110
Not only that, they killed so many people

01:58.311 --> 02:02.260
who ever tried to utter a word about them.

02:02.461 --> 02:07.120
They were much worse than Muslim people.

02:07.413 --> 02:12.276
They went to other countries like South
America, America -

02:12.477 --> 02:19.841
all these places they're all Catholics -
even our country.

02:20.055 --> 02:28.047
And they killed millions and millions
of people.

02:31.271 --> 02:35.713
Now as this is Kruta Yuga that has started,

02:35.914 --> 02:39.060
one of the things as I said yesterday
is that:

02:39.261 --> 02:43.635
you will have to pay for whatever you
have done,

02:43.836 --> 02:48.236
on mass scale or individual scale.

02:50.808 --> 02:53.994
If that is the case,

02:54.195 --> 02:58.380
then one must know that France has to pay
a lot

02:58.581 --> 03:04.094
and this Catholic church has to pay more.

03:05.166 --> 03:09.764
Catholic church has just taken out yarns
out of their heads

03:09.965 --> 03:14.963
and started a theory of original sin.

03:15.164 --> 03:20.237
That's how to condemn every other
Incarnation, every other Prophet -

03:20.438 --> 03:22.946
that they were all with original sin.

03:23.147 --> 03:26.179
And even they said Mary was born with
original sin,

03:26.380 --> 03:30.727
for many popes they were discussing it.

03:32.561 --> 03:38.598
This shows that this whole hocus-pocus
religion of Catholic church

03:38.799 --> 03:45.556
had to establish itself by forcing people,
by torturing them,

03:45.757 --> 03:53.084
by taking all their ideas into their
own control,

03:53.285 --> 03:58.521
give them funny ideas like original sin.

03:58.722 --> 04:05.898
Another is that you must confess, giving
them the left Vishuddhis.

04:06.120 --> 04:11.425
They treated women as nothing

04:11.626 --> 04:15.758
and to Mother of Mary they called Her
a woman.

04:15.959 --> 04:19.611
And this Paul, as I told you yesterday,
is a fact.

04:19.825 --> 04:23.844
Now it's necessary for Sahaja Yogis
to understand

04:24.045 --> 04:32.902
how this Catholic church is so dangerous
and has been doing such harm.

04:33.103 --> 04:37.747
As there has been so many books about it -

04:37.948 --> 04:43.610
that you people don't read, because
it's not in French.

04:44.103 --> 04:50.100
There are English books from America -
you must learn English.

04:50.301 --> 04:54.159
It's very important now I feel, that
all the French must know English,

04:54.360 --> 04:57.243
they must read English.

04:57.444 --> 05:02.384
French will not give you the international
personality

05:02.585 --> 05:06.421
that you are supposed to acquire.

05:06.635 --> 05:10.323
You had some scholarship, not much.

05:10.524 --> 05:13.858
The real scholarship comes from England

05:14.059 --> 05:21.811
and also from America in English language,
and also from India.

05:22.012 --> 05:27.347
One gentleman who tried to translate
all these things in UNESCO,

05:27.548 --> 05:31.003
he was thrown out by your media.

05:31.210 --> 05:36.184
Your media is taking full advantage that
you don't read any other newspapers;

05:36.385 --> 05:39.743
they are doing whatever they feel like.

05:39.944 --> 05:47.384
All kinds of scandals, all kinds
of sensationalization -

05:47.585 --> 05:51.522
whatever they want to write, they write
in free press.

05:51.723 --> 05:57.006
On one side there's suppression of natural
life of human beings,

05:57.207 --> 06:00.381
let them to go to Freud.

06:00.582 --> 06:04.084
When Freud is the dirtiest man you
could think of,

06:04.285 --> 06:07.452
who has put his ideas into your head.

06:07.653 --> 06:14.407
But as if you are already brainwashed
people that you accepted all that.

06:14.608 --> 06:18.647
How could you accept Freud? If Freud
had come to India,

06:18.848 --> 06:21.753
they would have killed him in no time!

06:21.954 --> 06:25.840
What happens is that, somehow or other -
I don't know what is the reason,

06:26.041 --> 06:30.445
I don't know where to place it, but
the wisdom is not there.

06:30.646 --> 06:34.251
There is no maturity, there is no wisdom.

06:34.452 --> 06:39.068
America I can understand because it is only
two-three hundred years old.

06:39.269 --> 06:43.291
But what about the French? They have
not been able

06:43.492 --> 06:48.336
to mature but they have become extremely
frivolous.

06:48.537 --> 06:51.839
Maturity is finished.

06:52.040 --> 06:58.791
One of the reasons could be that they want
that you should be always young.

06:58.992 --> 07:05.364
In India, young people are called
as stupid:

07:06.468 --> 07:11.933
you call it gadha pachisi, means
at twenty-five years they are donkeys.

07:12.134 --> 07:17.981
They are never regarded as sensible people
to be followed.

07:18.576 --> 07:25.809
And gradually by this movement from
Catholic church to Freud,

07:26.013 --> 07:29.737
what has happened that you haven't got
your own personality

07:29.938 --> 07:34.531
to understand what is right and what is
wrong.

07:34.732 --> 07:38.120
Of course, I must say Sahaja Yogis must
have done lots of punyas

07:38.321 --> 07:43.783
and must be very courageous people to be
born in this country.

07:43.984 --> 07:47.923
Otherwise I don't know how you could have
taken your birth here.

07:48.124 --> 07:56.687
The law is so funny that they said it
depends on the mood of the magistrate,

07:56.888 --> 08:03.616
As if, you see, the magistrate doesn't
know the law.

08:04.212 --> 08:08.599
Such a stupid country in modern times
I've never known.

08:08.800 --> 08:12.269
Nowhere in the world there's such a stupid
law as it is here.

08:12.470 --> 08:16.527
Of course, in America, there is no justice,
they do what they like.

08:16.728 --> 08:22.206
But here is so-called modern people.

08:22.407 --> 08:26.615
What is their condition is that they have
no sense of law.

08:26.816 --> 08:29.293
If you ask them, "What is the law?"
They don't care.

08:29.494 --> 08:32.134
It's the mood of the magistrate.

08:32.335 --> 08:36.539
Now supposing he has had a big drink
in the last night,

08:36.740 --> 08:41.154
second day he comes with a hangover,
so finished.

08:41.355 --> 08:48.410
And then he will be very much biased
towards the drunkards only.

08:49.056 --> 08:56.695
So, here it is becoming such a horrible
society

08:56.896 --> 09:04.022
that Indians would be shocked, beyond
doubt, but nothing but prostitution.

09:09.203 --> 09:13.247
To see and to be seen.

09:13.988 --> 09:15.801
Why?

09:16.002 --> 09:18.782
Every woman has to dress up in such a way

09:18.983 --> 09:25.665
that she should be attractive, for what?
Is she a prostitute?

09:28.211 --> 09:34.844
All kinds of bathroom cultures developed.

09:35.045 --> 09:41.189
For example French bath, you know what
it means, all over the world.

09:41.390 --> 09:47.749
It's a very dirty habit of laziness,
it comes because of drinking.

09:47.950 --> 09:51.579
If you drink too much, next morning you
are so lethargic

09:51.780 --> 09:56.169
that you take just a French bath and
go away.

09:56.370 --> 09:58.873
So, please try to remember as French
Sahaja Yogis,

09:59.074 --> 10:04.583
that your task is much more difficult
than the task of other countries,

10:04.784 --> 10:12.905
because it lacks completely wisdom.

10:13.475 --> 10:18.783
Neither you'll find in your institutions,
nor in your government,

10:18.984 --> 10:26.617
nor in any education.

10:27.152 --> 10:32.053
It's lacking wisdom completely.

10:33.652 --> 10:37.391
And to have wisdom, according to these
Freudian people,

10:37.592 --> 10:41.659
is that you are egoistical!

10:44.407 --> 10:49.491
They have such funny ideas from the yarn
of Mr. Freud

10:49.692 --> 10:54.666
that no sensible man would accept.

10:55.872 --> 11:01.593
But people have lost their senses,
and like blotting paper,

11:01.794 --> 11:11.957
whatever is filthy, destructive, horrible,
subhuman, they try to absorb.

11:12.943 --> 11:17.133
Supposed to be Christian nation.

11:20.781 --> 11:25.171
Please, all Sahaja Yogis must understand:

11:25.372 --> 11:31.447
you must get hold of books and find out,
where are we?

11:31.648 --> 11:36.000
I worked very hard in France, you know
that very well.

11:36.201 --> 11:39.251
I used to think, this is the gate of hell.

11:39.452 --> 11:43.215
But it is much worse than that,

11:43.416 --> 11:48.487
it's a mire of filth. And you are born here

11:48.688 --> 11:55.045
and you have become like lotuses,
so fragrant and beautiful,

11:55.246 --> 11:58.002
you'll have to fight it out.

11:58.203 --> 12:01.142
I am always with you, all My powers
with you.

12:01.343 --> 12:04.517
But remember that you have to fight
the society,

12:04.718 --> 12:10.262
you have to save so many people, you have
to rescue them.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.955
Children are given liberty, "Do what
you like."

12:15.156 --> 12:18.209
They have no sense of liberty!

12:18.410 --> 12:20.859
Supposing there's an aeroplane,

12:21.060 --> 12:23.862
which was not fixed properly and made
to fly.

12:24.063 --> 12:27.349
What will happen to the aeroplane?

12:27.550 --> 12:33.851
If the children are given liberty without
the right sense of their duty

12:34.052 --> 12:38.793
and the right sense about themselves,
what will happen to them?

12:38.994 --> 12:46.151
Why children are born to parents?
It is to get spoiled,

12:46.352 --> 12:51.663
to have liberty or to get some guidance?

12:52.046 --> 12:55.568
You cannot guide your children.

12:55.769 --> 13:01.338
They are so rude, they are so arrogant.

13:01.539 --> 13:07.394
They have gone off, completely.

13:07.595 --> 13:11.307
You know for one month we had to struggle
with these western children.

13:11.530 --> 13:14.736
And we had come to the point of urge
of closing down that school

13:14.937 --> 13:19.046
because they were really violent children,

13:19.247 --> 13:22.247
as if coming from some jungle.

13:22.454 --> 13:26.505
Even the jungle animals have some sense.

13:27.441 --> 13:31.171
So you have to think about your children.

13:31.372 --> 13:34.728
What's going to happen to your children?

13:34.929 --> 13:38.819
What is going to be their situation?

13:39.192 --> 13:45.135
If they are going to live in the same
manner in this dirt,

13:45.336 --> 13:52.610
these children will turn out to be waste,
just a waste!

13:52.811 --> 13:58.714
They will have no education, no character,
no personality,

13:58.915 --> 14:08.654
they'll end up with AIDS or with drugs
or something like that.

14:08.855 --> 14:15.026
I do not see any future for the children
of France, no future.

14:18.209 --> 14:23.614
And you have to fight that, "We want
to have future for our children,

14:23.815 --> 14:26.474
we don't want them to be ruined."

14:26.675 --> 14:30.691
And you must have courage to fight it.

14:30.892 --> 14:35.202
It's very important to have courage.

14:35.403 --> 14:40.494
If you do not have the courage, you cannot
fight it.

14:40.695 --> 14:46.761
And today's puja is to give that courage
in your hearts.

14:46.962 --> 14:52.841
See it all around you, what's happening?

14:53.042 --> 14:56.764
You are all nicely enjoying yourself
in the realm of God,

14:56.965 --> 14:58.863
you have entered into the Kingdom of God.

14:59.064 --> 15:03.345
But what about the rest of the people?

15:03.563 --> 15:08.474
The majority of the people, where are they
going?

15:11.860 --> 15:25.787
What is going to be the future of this
horrible Mooladhara place?

15:27.541 --> 15:33.150
Now Freud has been discovered
as a fraudulent man,

15:33.351 --> 15:36.264
and now there are books after so many
years,

15:36.465 --> 15:40.444
when he has already ruined the people
all over the world.

15:40.645 --> 15:45.125
But the worst of all, they have ruined
here.

15:49.265 --> 15:51.988
It's a responsibility specially
of the women I think,

15:52.189 --> 15:56.034
because they are responsible for
the society.

15:56.235 --> 16:01.611
The society of France has gone to dogs

16:02.047 --> 16:08.227
and for you to now take up upon yourself

16:08.428 --> 16:14.861
to talk against this kind of anarchy

16:15.062 --> 16:20.472
that is working out the destruction
of your families.

16:22.215 --> 16:30.769
If the women decide, I am sure, they
can very, very easily work it out.

16:30.970 --> 16:36.039
Instead of asking for liberation
nonsensical,

16:36.615 --> 16:41.264
you better ask for the ascent of this
country.

16:41.465 --> 16:44.626
I know, I've worked very hard and you are
all there.

16:44.827 --> 16:47.619
I am very happy to see that you all
are there

16:47.820 --> 16:59.474
to fulfill the desires of the Divine.

16:59.675 --> 17:05.400
Because now you should know in a very
big way,

17:05.601 --> 17:11.432
masses of masses of people will be
destroyed.

17:15.211 --> 17:19.651
Not from without but from within.

17:21.385 --> 17:27.335
Suddenly you'll hear so many millions
disappear with this disease.

17:31.189 --> 17:36.296
Also you must protect yourself, all of you:

17:36.497 --> 17:44.014
always give yourself a bandhan; always
lead a clean life.

17:44.215 --> 17:50.441
There are certain hygienic rules of Sahaja
Yoga, please try to follow them.

17:50.642 --> 17:53.814
Do not neglect it.

17:54.015 --> 17:58.034
If somebody gets AIDS, you'll not have him
in Sahaja Yoga,

17:58.235 --> 18:02.684
whatever may be the conditions, whatever
may be the reason.

18:04.777 --> 18:10.177
You have to be very careful, also I would
say never treat a AIDS patient.

18:10.378 --> 18:12.963
Like the one yesterday who was arguing
with Me,

18:13.164 --> 18:17.280
actually because they have only two types
of people:

18:17.481 --> 18:24.507
one who are arrogant and another one
which always

18:26.737 --> 18:31.519
think that it's better they should die.
They have no will to live.

18:31.720 --> 18:36.238
So there are only two types of people,
either right-sided or left-sided.

18:36.439 --> 18:40.995
And they can never ascend. We have tried,
we have tried.

18:41.196 --> 18:44.305
Of course, one person is living
for the last seven years,

18:44.543 --> 18:49.950
but still he has no faith in himself.

18:50.151 --> 18:55.456
Maybe next generation might be better on,
if they come back.

18:55.657 --> 18:59.825
But as far as this generation is concerned,

19:00.026 --> 19:04.781
you should know your responsibility
is very great.

19:04.982 --> 19:09.725
All the Sahaja Yogis must take a vow

19:09.926 --> 19:14.762
that they'll fight this society and try
to save their country

19:14.963 --> 19:20.528
and their countrymen from a complete
disaster.

19:20.729 --> 19:24.097
There is going to be no war,

19:24.298 --> 19:29.365
only they will fight themselves and die.

19:31.341 --> 19:33.622
It's a very serious matter.

19:33.823 --> 19:39.199
For that, we decided to have this puja
of Durga today

19:39.400 --> 19:43.668
that all negativity should be destroyed.

19:43.869 --> 19:50.875
So many Deities build up the body of Kali.

19:51.076 --> 19:56.592
Every part of Her body was created
by a Deity, looked after by a Deity,

19:56.793 --> 20:04.577
and is also, later on, is reflected
in you all.

20:06.771 --> 20:10.845
So they say that God has made human beings
in His own image,

20:11.046 --> 20:14.667
I would say, I've made you in My own
image,

20:14.868 --> 20:19.781
all the Deities at your disposal.

20:19.982 --> 20:24.279
They're all with you, and they have created
you - if you see it minutely -

20:24.480 --> 20:29.769
it is the Deities who have brought forth
all the beauty that you had.

20:29.970 --> 20:39.568
They have made all this beautiful
congregation, beautiful transformation,

20:39.769 --> 20:47.424
and they have created such angelic people
out of you.

20:48.100 --> 20:50.696
They are always working it out,

20:50.897 --> 20:56.370
but one thing you have to do is to have
the drive.

20:56.571 --> 21:01.722
You had pure desire to ascend, but
for what?

21:01.923 --> 21:06.354
You want to have the light, but for what?

21:06.555 --> 21:10.501
You want to become gurus, for what?

21:10.702 --> 21:15.295
To save people, for their salvation.

21:15.525 --> 21:18.939
Only through your channels I can work out
Sahaja Yoga.

21:19.140 --> 21:22.371
If I could work out Myself, I would have.

21:22.572 --> 21:27.129
It's not question of killing one rakshasa.

21:27.330 --> 21:32.245
God knows how many there are, rakshasas
and rakshasas.

21:32.446 --> 21:38.452
And they are everywhere, even within you
they were.

21:38.653 --> 21:42.149
Now they have gone away.

21:45.493 --> 21:51.283
So you have to do full justice to Sahaja
Yoga, that's very important.

21:51.484 --> 21:54.478
I knew the puja would be very late,
because Kali's puja

21:54.679 --> 22:01.042
is always done in the night, after twelve.
So it had to be this way.

22:01.243 --> 22:03.677
Though last night I slept at four o'clock
and I,  tonight,

22:03.878 --> 22:10.873
I don't know what time I will sleep -
it all works out. It's all worked out.

22:11.074 --> 22:14.124
But you have to have deliberations
and you have to think,

22:14.325 --> 22:16.937
“What can we do to change this?”

22:17.138 --> 22:23.928
Why not write some books, why not write
some experiences?

22:24.129 --> 22:29.647
Get them published in French only. Let
the French know what’s happening outside.

22:29.848 --> 22:34.000
Get some of the books translated –

22:35.362 --> 22:41.616
some American books, some English books.
At least give quotations from there.

22:41.817 --> 22:45.971
How they are unaware. First this Catholic
church has to go away.

22:46.172 --> 22:52.404
It will, no doubt, I am sure about it.
They are literally frightened of us.

22:58.319 --> 23:04.956
And we have to now really show them
what we are capable of.

23:06.988 --> 23:14.760
And the funniest thing is that a president
has chosen

23:14.961 --> 23:17.328
his lady-friend as the prime minister.

23:17.529 --> 23:24.523
I mean, it’s not possible in any sensible
country. It’s never heard of.

23:24.724 --> 23:29.865
I must say, English are thousand times
better.

23:30.753 --> 23:33.191
They are really very good.

23:33.392 --> 23:37.251
At least, as far as administration
is concerned,

23:37.452 --> 23:41.414
as far as their parliament is concerned.
Their justice is not stupid like this,

23:41.615 --> 23:46.549
it’s based on law, not based on the mood
of a magistrate.

23:46.750 --> 23:50.052
How you are still continuing with such
stupidity

23:50.253 --> 23:54.969
which are really even before medieval age:

23:55.170 --> 24:01.073
primitive, people are absolutely primitive
to accept such laws.

24:01.274 --> 24:09.193
At least you can write a book about
the strange laws of French, one title.

24:13.403 --> 24:17.034
How it has harmed. There is a very nice
book, “Fraudulent Freud”.

24:17.235 --> 24:21.617
Please read that, and see how Freud
has ruined the French,

24:21.818 --> 24:25.251
how their brains are twisted, how they
have twisted ideas.

24:25.452 --> 24:29.650
You are all so intelligent, clever people.

24:32.023 --> 24:39.386
So if not with the sword, Kali has to work
through the pen.

24:46.311 --> 24:52.407
I never knew it was in that bad shape,
though I knew it was.

24:53.868 --> 24:59.033
So this is a challenge for all of us,

24:59.234 --> 25:06.314
and let Me see what you can write, all
of you, put together your experiences:

25:06.515 --> 25:09.845
how the French parents behave, how
the grandparents behave,

25:10.046 --> 25:14.286
what’s happening in this country and
all that.

25:19.588 --> 25:23.781
They are living in fool’s paradise.

25:25.899 --> 25:34.139
They don’t know how destruction is just
hanging over their heads.

25:37.952 --> 25:43.173
Though you are all saved, but you have
to think of others,

25:43.374 --> 25:50.859
that is what Sahaja Yoga is, that is not
only that we care for the bhaktas –

25:51.060 --> 25:59.499
like Kali just wanted to protect
the bhaktas, the sadhakas.

26:00.237 --> 26:09.231
But you have to protect many, many more
people.

26:09.432 --> 26:16.170
You have all the powers, just assume them
and use them.

26:17.972 --> 26:20.926
You can do it.

26:21.127 --> 26:24.486
Your media is the worst of all

26:24.687 --> 26:28.978
and we can start a newspaper also calling
it anti-media.

26:29.179 --> 26:32.402
What can they do to us?

26:32.603 --> 26:37.800
Or some sort of an independent name,
we can give it.

26:38.347 --> 26:41.921
And it should be open for people who
are suffering

26:42.122 --> 26:48.560
from media sensationalization.
They can write:

26:48.761 --> 26:52.555
how the media is harming them, how they
are giving false reports and things.

26:52.756 --> 26:55.882
We can! Why not?

26:58.954 --> 27:02.183
I am sure it will work out.

27:03.764 --> 27:08.768
Think it over what you can do with
your pen.

27:12.500 --> 27:16.877
Whatever you have gained, whatever you
are enjoying: beautiful music,

27:17.078 --> 27:20.574
all the pujas, everything. But think
of others.

27:20.775 --> 27:27.268
They are already drunk and tossing
their heads on their pillows.

27:27.469 --> 27:33.603
Think of them. They, when will they feel
this joy?

27:33.822 --> 27:36.447
I simply feel pity for them

27:36.648 --> 27:41.006
that they should have taken to all these
bad things,

27:41.207 --> 27:43.208
because of the suppression of the Catholic
church.

27:43.409 --> 27:45.616
It’s the Catholic church which has
suppressed them,

27:45.817 --> 27:48.978
that’s why they have come to this.
No other way –

27:49.179 --> 27:53.617
reason why they should accept this kind
of thing.

27:57.906 --> 28:02.633
In Sahaja Yoga, we do not do all these
things, we are in the centre.

28:02.834 --> 28:06.855
We do not have this kind of problems,
because we don’t suppress anyone,

28:07.056 --> 28:11.180
nor do we go to the other extreme
of indulgences.

28:11.381 --> 28:14.830
I think the whole Europe can be divided
into two types of people:

28:15.031 --> 28:19.197
one are Anglo-Saxons, and others are
Latins.

28:19.398 --> 28:24.291
Anglo-Saxons are right-sided and the Latins
are left-sided:

28:24.492 --> 28:31.888
they cry, weep, miserable, they indulge
into dirt and filth.

28:32.517 --> 28:35.586
Just these two types they are.

28:35.787 --> 28:41.446
Now, unluckily you are in the Latin side.

28:42.204 --> 28:48.555
So here, Catholic church is prospering.

28:49.190 --> 28:54.641
Now, if you see to the Latin side and
understand

28:54.842 --> 28:58.223
to what extent they have gone to the left
side,

28:58.424 --> 29:03.515
and getting to the left side what diseases
you get, very nicely,

29:03.716 --> 29:07.009
make a list of them.

29:07.210 --> 29:11.682
So what I said will work out in France:

29:11.883 --> 29:15.701
the left-sided incurable diseases.

29:15.902 --> 29:19.476
As it is, you walk on the street, you find
at least three, four

29:19.677 --> 29:24.908
mad people, lunatic people walking,
you’ll find them.

29:25.711 --> 29:30.456
Very simple it is. You don’t have to go
to the lunatic asylum, on the street!

29:30.657 --> 29:36.326
They’ll be all talking and saying things,
but it’s all there.

29:36.527 --> 29:39.964
“That’s why they drink, that’s why they
are miserable.”.

29:40.164 --> 29:45.725
I do not know what are the statistics
of the diseases.

29:50.133 --> 29:54.970
So the problem is extremely grave,
very grave.

29:55.171 --> 29:58.488
And you have to work it out,

29:58.689 --> 30:03.604
with the gravity of your Gurupada which
you have asked Me the other day –

30:03.805 --> 30:09.551
you asked for the status of a guru,
for ladies as well as for men.

30:09.752 --> 30:14.307
And I said, “All right, start!”

30:15.600 --> 30:20.867
I hope you all have heard the song
I’ve made, for asking.

30:21.068 --> 30:23.498
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Marathi]

30:23.699 --> 30:25.282
All right, once they will sing that song.

30:25.483 --> 30:27.779
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Marathi]
All right.

30:27.980 --> 30:38.392
They will sing that song to you. There are
different requests from the Mother,

30:38.593 --> 30:42.756
and in this the last one is that: “Mother,
now you give us

30:42.957 --> 30:47.117
the Gurupada, the status of a guru.”

30:47.318 --> 30:52.866
But every guru has a duty: to cleanse
the society in which he lives.

30:53.067 --> 30:56.127
It’s his duty, he has to fight it.

30:56.328 --> 31:00.879
Christ fought it alone, so many saints
fought it alone,

31:01.080 --> 31:06.177
they were treated very badly, put in jail,
given poisons, things, but they fought it.

31:06.378 --> 31:11.478
In the same way you stand on Truth,
and you have to fight it.

31:13.736 --> 31:17.111
Because you are saints.

31:20.643 --> 31:23.009
May God bless you.
