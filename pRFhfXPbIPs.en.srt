00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:03,330
Shri Krishna Puja
Cabella Ligure, Italy

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:04,430
August 16, 1992

3
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:10,430
Today we have decided to have the puja of
Shri Krishna.

4
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:23,349
We have many a times done this puja and have
understood the essence of Shri Krishna’s

5
00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:27,329
advent, which was six thousand years back.

6
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:46,330
And now, what His manifestation was, what
He wanted to be accomplished has to be done

7
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:50,640
in this Kali Yuga.

8
00:00:50,640 --> 00:01:02,320
As it is, this Kali Yuga is going into a new
realm of Satya Yuga, but in between there

9
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:15,009
is Krita Yuga where this Brahmachaitanya,
or we can say the all-pervading Power of God’s

10
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:18,130
love, is going to act.

11
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:29,200
At this time, what is going to happen with
Shri Krishna’s powers – this is what we

12
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,630
have to see.

13
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:37,649
Shri Krishna, as I told you, was the incarnation
also of diplomacy.

14
00:01:37,649 --> 00:01:46,709
So He plays around quite a lot, and ultimately
He brings forth the untruth and the falsehood;

15
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:48,759
but in doing that He judges people.

16
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:57,109
So it’s very important that Shri Krishna’s
powers of His diplomacy were to be manifesting

17
00:01:57,109 --> 00:02:02,639
at this time, when it is the Last Judgment.

18
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:16,490
So now whatever we have done wrong before,
whatever karmas which have been done in ignorance

19
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:24,220
maybe, or maybe deliberately, all of them
will be paid back.

20
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:32,440
Those punyas which you have done in previous
lives, this life, will be also rewarded.

21
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:41,100
This is all done through Shri Krishna’s
principles of collectivity, where He collectively

22
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,370
sees the situation.

23
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:56,580
For example, as I told you last time also
that Columbus luckily went to America; luckily,

24
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:01,400
so we were saved, otherwise we would not have
been here.

25
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:10,840
And then these Spanish people, bullfighters,
they went and started fighting the poor, unarmed

26
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:17,210
people who were just very simple owners of
that land.

27
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:23,100
But they went and occupied those lands, and
killed every one of them.

28
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:28,510
So in America you can’t find anyone, no
doubt, but even in South America you have

29
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:35,920
to go to Colombia or to Bolivia, to great
heights, to see some aboriginals there; otherwise

30
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,470
most of them are finished.

31
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:44,590
So now in Krita Yuga all these diseases have
started cropping up.

32
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:52,660
But the best part is the drug addiction.

33
00:03:52,660 --> 00:04:02,230
These drugs are made, for your information,
in Bolivia and in Colombia.

34
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:10,390
You drove them down there, so now you have
the drugs and very nicely you are very welcoming

35
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:12,120
them.

36
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:23,540
People went in Nicaragua to help them and
brought back all these horrible drugs to Washington;

37
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:29,260
and in every elite society they are just discussing
which is the best drug, where is the sale

38
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:33,160
on and where should they buy the drugs.

39
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:39,520
So the all of America is now worried how much
drug they can import, and kill themselves

40
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,090
and destroy themselves.

41
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:48,250
So this destruction has started from inside.

42
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:55,100
Then in addition to that, when I went there
first I told them not to indulge into these

43
00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:11,070
Freudian practices but keep to morality, otherwise
you’ll have problems.

44
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:23,320
So they had first AIDS, secondly now yuppie’s
disease, and all kinds of secret diseases

45
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,900
they have.

46
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:31,139
Among ten people there would be at least one
person who is suffering from that, and among

47
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:36,400
twenty people there’ll be at least one person
who must be suffering from schizophrenia.

48
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:45,480
Because they made every person, every other
country nervous, so now they are getting schizophrenia.

49
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:50,730
Like this we can see even in England.

50
00:05:50,730 --> 00:06:02,740
Now in England they came to India as traders,
ordinary traders, and plundered us completely,

51
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:08,900
no doubt, ruled us for three hundred years
– as I say, it’s gracious hospitality

52
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:16,600
they had – and then they left us in three
pieces.

53
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:21,340
And now in their own country there are problems,
all kinds.

54
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:29,510
First of all nobody wants to call themselves
as English; they all call themselves Welsh

55
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:34,210
or Scots, or specially the Irish.

56
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:38,870
And there is always a bomb scare in London,
every time, and for our first program also

57
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,639
there was a bomb scare.

58
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:47,810
So you can imagine these English who tried
to divide us are automatically divided among

59
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:50,260
themselves, and now fighting each other.

60
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:56,690
But there are other problems also like AIDS
and immoral life, everything like that.

61
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:59,020
Same with the French.

62
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:06,320
French tried to sell their wine all over,
and bring their horrible bathroom culture

63
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,520
everywhere.

64
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,130
Now they are suffering from it.

65
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:15,919
For example, most of the time they’re drunk
and they have lost all moorings, I mean, they

66
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,310
have no sense left in their heads.

67
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:24,270
Like a housewife could be a prostitute – allowed
by law.

68
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:27,120
All such things are happening.

69
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,990
Now they are paying, and the worst that they
are paying, all these countries who think

70
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:36,530
no end of themselves, are recession.

71
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:42,630
This is also Shri Krishna’s power, because
He’s Kubera.

72
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:46,280
He’s the one who is the power of wealth.

73
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:52,510
He gave lot of wealth to all these countries,
and now they don’t know what to do with

74
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,510
themselves.

75
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:59,199
We can see in these fifty years how many things
have happened, but specially these twenty

76
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,580
years have been really remarkable.

77
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:11,860
All over the world you can find out there
has been some sort of a complete change, or

78
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,130
an exposure.

79
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:24,570
Even in Italy you see every day this Vatican
is here exposed, or some mafia connections

80
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:30,902
are there, or this what you call, people from
the government are exposed.

81
00:08:30,902 --> 00:08:38,770
I am doing nothing, I’m just sitting here,
but it is working out that way.

82
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:42,870
Since I have been here I don’t know how
many people have gone to jail, God knows.

83
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:46,770
(I don’t know if she’s not brought My
throat pastilles.

84
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:55,000
I had a bath early in the morning, so a little
bit … This is, Shri Krishna is trying to

85
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,380
fill Me up!)

86
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:16,890
We Indians are also suffering,because our
past deeds – like we had a caste system.

87
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:21,270
So now the caste system has become the greatest
headache for us in India, that’s the greatest

88
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,370
cancer for us.

89
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:33,420
Like that, everywhere these twenty years or
twenty-one years have been … ( … I don’t

90
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:38,210
know, because morning.

91
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:54,900
Also reaction on Me … ) So like that in
every country, you’ll see gradually, every

92
00:09:54,900 --> 00:10:02,050
country will have to face for what it has
done.

93
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:12,980
Also Shri Krishna’s own style was that He
can never believed in caste system.

94
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:22,660
He Himself was born in a caste which is a,
what you call is a milkman’s caste, and

95
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:29,850
then He became a king, of course; but to begin
with, and He lived like an ordinary person.

96
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:36,440
He used to take the cows outside, look after
them and bring them home.

97
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:46,050
Now if you see His life you’ll find He is
absolutely very human, the way He used to

98
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:48,580
tease His mother, tease other ladies.

99
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:55,070
All this is extremely human and childlike,
and extremely sweet.

100
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:59,089
But behind that also there was a great significance.

101
00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:07,290
For example, Shri Radha – as you know, She
was Mahalakshmi – and as Mahalakshmi She

102
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:14,200
used to put Her feet, take bath in the river
Yamuna, and the ladies would take water from

103
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,270
the same river, carry on their head the pitchers.

104
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:25,410
Now Shri Krishna wanted to raise their kundalini,
so He used to hit them from the back so that

105
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:32,170
the water falls on their back, and that vibrated
water would raise their kundalini.

106
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:36,360
This was His childish trick, but it had a
meaning.

107
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:42,029
Another one, when we see Him in ras – “ra”
means energy.

108
00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:47,839
Radha: “ra” is “energy,” “dha”
means “the one who sustains it” – so

109
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,720
it is Radhaji who had the energy.

110
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:59,220
“Sa” means “with,” so when they played
ras, was nothing but to play with the energy.

111
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:04,700
And that’s how He wanted to have a collective
awakening of people, of gopa and gopis, and

112
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,120
He did it.

113
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,430
But then He had to leave and fight this Kamsa.

114
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:17,060
In His own lifetime, as a child or grown-up,
He punished all kinds of devils and women

115
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:21,500
devils who were like Putna, and all that.

116
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:26,740
He did it, and in this Kali Yuga also He’s
active.

117
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:33,670
We have seen how gradually He has finished
so many false gurus, one by one; somebody

118
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:38,769
who called himself Shri Krishna, somebody
who called himself as God, something else,

119
00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:39,769
something else.

120
00:12:39,769 --> 00:12:44,709
He finished them all, exposed them nicely,
and now we have very few people in the arena

121
00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:48,630
left for us to fight.

122
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:52,310
They themselves are trembling and they are
quite frightened of us, because we are standing

123
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:56,870
on truth.

124
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:05,450
So now, when we have to think about Shri Krishna
who is residing in our Vishuddhi Chakra.

125
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:12,370
Many people have this problem of left Vishuddhi.

126
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:20,680
That is because we are more sort of very social
people.

127
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:27,050
Now in the Western society, the social system
is so rigid that anybody can collapse with

128
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:33,670
that, or used to be; now better because of
the, maybe the revolt, anti-culture.

129
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:40,399
But otherwise if you could put one spoon from
here to there, then you are finished.

130
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:46,580
If you start your food with, say, not with
the fish knife but with an ordinary knife,

131
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,990
then you’re finished, you are no good.

132
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:57,010
And these French have made even much worse
by using a big science out of alcohol.

133
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:04,350
For this alcohol this is the glass, for that
alcohol that is the glass, and all that.

134
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:08,320
So the whole collective was made so rigid.

135
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,800
It’s much more rigid than in India.

136
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:16,550
I used to think Indian collective is quite
rigid because of certain conditionings we

137
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:28,060
have, but after coming to the West I was surprised
that it is such a conditioning in the heads

138
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:34,769
of the people, that some of the conditionings
you cannot remove – say from Catholic Church,

139
00:14:34,769 --> 00:14:37,470
you might say, or from wherever it is.

140
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:45,971
But when it comes from somebody like Freud
who was absolutely a devil, they just give

141
00:14:45,971 --> 00:14:49,760
up all these conditionings and take to that.

142
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:56,750
I cannot understand any country where there
is Catholic Church so predominant, they are

143
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,940
following Freud.

144
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:07,630
So this collective rigidity, which was then
because maybe Shri Rama was a very formal

145
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:14,839
person, because of Him maybe the collective
rigidity might have been in India.

146
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:21,140
But in the West it is all mental, it’s absolutely
mental.

147
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:26,890
If you make this kind of hair then you are
all right, if you put oil then you are absolutely

148
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:34,510
lunatic: all kinds of funny ideas were given,
and people started doing like this.

149
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,940
If you don’t put oil at all you’ll become
bald.

150
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:40,160
If you become bald, then they will have a
business of their wigs.

151
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:46,050
So the whole thing was money-oriented, and
everything was made so fixed that you had

152
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:49,100
to do it so that they could sell their things.

153
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:54,260
England was, as you know, is tailcoat: you
have to wear a tailcoat if you have to see

154
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,260
the Queen.

155
00:15:55,260 --> 00:16:00,850
I don’t know why you have to wear a tailcoat
to see the Queen, but it’s compulsory, and

156
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:03,760
if you don’t wear then you are not allowed.

157
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:08,601
So they have to borrow these tailcoats and
all that from one shop, which can be tight,

158
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:15,380
which can be loose, and everybody looks like
Charlie Chaplin to Me!

159
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:18,810
They can’t walk straight.

160
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:31,550
So this kind of stupid rigidity that came
into the West has really made them very nervous.

161
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,010
People are so nervous here.

162
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:42,089
If you tell some lady that “I am going to
come and have food with you,” she will collapse.

163
00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:48,639
God knows what she thinks, I mean, it is caring
for the public opinion, or her own conditioning.

164
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:55,110
But in an Indian, a housewife, if you tell
her you are going to come, she’ll be the

165
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,540
happiest person.

166
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:01,170
She’ll be very happy that you are coming
to her house for dinner.

167
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:05,670
But here even if you say, “I would like
to come and see you in the evening,” they’ll

168
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,800
say, “All right, come in the pub.”

169
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:15,250
Because they’re so nervous, they’re not
sure of themself; and this has come, I think,

170
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:18,790
perhaps from these norms that there have been
created in the West.

171
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:27,750
In India also we had lots of these ritualism
that came up very serious.

172
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:36,320
Like we had people, Jainis who’d pick up
their hair with their hands.

173
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:47,840
They are not supposed to use any knives or
any scissors or any barbers, so they were

174
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,910
supposed to pick up their hair on their own.

175
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:55,320
So from their beard, from their this thing,
they would pick up all the time.

176
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:02,700
That went to such a horrible conditioning
that they would say that if you, even if you

177
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:07,669
breathe then you can, you might consume some
animals.

178
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:12,730
So they would put some sort of a cloth before
their mouth, and all kinds of nonsense they

179
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:14,140
did.

180
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:18,840
At that time Shri Krishna came in.

181
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:25,770
His own cousin was a tirthankara, you’ll
be surprised, Neminath.

182
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:34,700
He became a tirthankara, and that made Shri
Krishna think about it, that this kind of

183
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,970
stupid ritualism that we have.

184
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:42,560
Like in the morning women will get up, in
their sleep they will go, put some water for

185
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:46,730
tulsi, do this thing, that thing, throw water
here and there.

186
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:52,790
And also the untouchables and touchables;
and you can’t take water from this, you

187
00:18:52,790 --> 00:19:00,460
can’t eat this, you can’t move like that
– all kinds of restrictions, timing, everything.

188
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:04,460
This time is not good, that time is not good,
this you should not do, that you should not

189
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:15,720
do, to such an extent that the whole movement
of our country was round these rituals.

190
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,780
I had nephews who used to come to Bombay for
their work.

191
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,940
Every time they went to Lucknow, they would
come with shaven heads.

192
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,770
I said, “What’s the matter?”

193
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:28,400
He said, “There are many people in our family
who are old, and when they die we have to

194
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,400
shave our heads.”

195
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:34,460
So every time they went there somebody died,
so they came with shaven heads.

196
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:40,780
Like that such horrible rituals existed, and
even now in the South India there is a lot

197
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:45,640
of rituals are there, terrible rituals, and
they cannot get out of it, they’re frightened.

198
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:53,120
If they get out of it then they might be sinners,
or they will go to hell.

199
00:19:53,120 --> 00:20:01,330
So the Indian conditioning was, as far as
these rigidities were concerned for religion,

200
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:09,510
to be on the right side in such a way that
we should not be caught up without doing this.

201
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:14,470
So early in the morning they’ll get up and
do the rituals, just without even thinking

202
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:19,070
about what they’re doing.

203
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:25,420
But in the West the lifestyle is nothing but
rigidity, the whole lifestyle is; there’s

204
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,040
no freedom anywhere.

205
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:32,860
And all that then was rewarded by these hippies
and other people, and all of them, and they

206
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:37,040
fought it, and that thing went to another
extremes.

207
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:42,080
So from one extreme to another extreme they
went.

208
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:48,440
Now, how Shri Krishna’s advent changed it.

209
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:59,470
When Shri Krishna came on this Earth, He said
this is all a leela, it is just a play.

210
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:04,460
Because you are involved into it, you cannot
see the play.

211
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:12,299
But if you ascend – if you are in the water
you are afraid of the water, but if you get

212
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:19,540
into the boat you can see the water, and if
you know how to swim you can even save the

213
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:22,210
people who are in the water.

214
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:31,100
So He says that if you develop a witness state,
sakshi swarupata, if you develop that state

215
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:34,600
then you see the whole thing as a drama.

216
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,630
Nothing affects you.

217
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:43,320
Nothing matters, you don’t worry about anything,
you see the problem above; you are, and you

218
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:47,240
see the problem, and because you are out of
it, you can solve the problem.

219
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:56,590
This was His great advent, I would say, that
has taught the first step towards the ascent,

220
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:59,809
is that you have to become a sakshi.

221
00:21:59,809 --> 00:22:02,309
You have to become the witness.

222
00:22:02,309 --> 00:22:07,350
Now let’s see in Sahaja Yoga.

223
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:14,000
In Sahaja Yoga there are different types of
people come from different areas, from different

224
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,809
cultures, because the door is open to everyone.

225
00:22:18,809 --> 00:22:28,080
Now if an Indian comes in, he will be all
the time watchful about others, and will say

226
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:33,070
that “Mother, this man is not doing this,
this man is not doing that.

227
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:35,260
He should have done footsoaking.”

228
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:42,539
He’ll find faults with others, all the time
saying that this man is not doing like this,

229
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:44,280
and you know.

230
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:48,940
But in the West they start finding faults
with themselves.

231
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:55,390
And I receive letters, ten to twelve pages
sometimes, confessing what wrong they have

232
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:56,390
done.

233
00:22:56,390 --> 00:23:01,470
Who is interested to know, what wrongs you
have done?

234
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:11,380
I mean, if a lotus is born, nobody wants to
know how many filthy things are inside the

235
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,380
pond.

236
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:15,590
You are now a lotus.

237
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:22,720
But it’s so common that they think we must
confess, we must tell Mother what wrong we

238
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,720
have done.

239
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,110
Every moment you are changing, so what is
there to confess?

240
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:35,260
And the life is so formal, as I told you,
that people suffer from guilt for anything.

241
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:43,159
Apart from the influence of this Catholic
Church has conditioned you so much that even

242
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:48,090
if you are not a Catholic, you’re a Protestant,
still you have guilt, and as a guilt you develop

243
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:50,630
this left Vishuddhi.

244
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:58,150
So then this left Vishuddhi is Vishnumaya
– means what?

245
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:05,620
Once you have this left Vishuddhi you develop
all the problems of the Vishnumaya, and one

246
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:08,880
of them is the heart.

247
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:17,500
Because Vishnumaya is an active thing, She
is like electricity; and if you have Vishnumaya

248
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,860
problem, then you become lethargic.

249
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:23,500
“Oh, I’m so guilty.”

250
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,500
You become depressed.

251
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:28,470
That Vishnumaya Principle disappears from
you.

252
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:37,520
She’s the one who’s quick, fast, and She
gives the light, and announces to the whole

253
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,450
world what Shri Krishna is.

254
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:47,050
While what happens with such people, Sahaja
yogis who come in, who feel guilty, they say,

255
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:52,980
“Mother, You know, we thought that if we
do this then our ego will come up.

256
00:24:52,980 --> 00:25:00,370
If we do any work outside and work in some
fields or in some villages, then our ego will

257
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:01,370
come up.

258
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:04,490
So we don’t want to do it.”

259
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:05,870
This is absurd.

260
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:11,580
It’s like you give light to some light,
and the light says that “I don’t want

261
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:19,179
to give the light, because maybe this light
might develop an ego.”

262
00:25:19,179 --> 00:25:20,179
It is absurd.

263
00:25:20,179 --> 00:25:25,980
But such absurd things Sahaja yogis tell Me.

264
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:32,559
For them one has to understand, to get out
of this left Vishuddhi is to become absolutely

265
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:39,440
dynamic in Sahaja Yoga, go all out into Sahaja
Yoga.

266
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,669
Otherwise they can’t get rid of their left
Vishuddhis.

267
00:25:42,669 --> 00:25:53,300
Left Vishuddhi is a thing that’s a very
depressive action on the whole being, and

268
00:25:53,300 --> 00:26:00,620
a person who has left Vishuddhi is always
a very slow person to do anything for Sahaja

269
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,620
Yoga.

270
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:04,190
You have not been given light to hide it.

271
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:10,520
Christ has said that you don’t put light
under the table.

272
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:17,390
So you have been given light to work it out,
to be dynamic, to think what to do, how to

273
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:19,510
arrange, how to organize.

274
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:24,940
But if you are guilty, then you will all the
time say, “Oh Mother, it’s very difficult,

275
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:31,120
You know, this . . .” Always you’ll find
the other side of the whole joke, just to

276
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,120
avoid.

277
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,470
Now for a Sahaja yogi is to witness himself,
first of all.

278
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:36,820
That is the introspection.

279
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:41,990
He should see for himself, “Where was I,
and I have come here.”

280
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:46,940
Don’t indulge too much in the past, but
see the distance you have crossed in such

281
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,350
a short time.

282
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:54,200
Now you have come into the Kingdom of God,
you have all the powers.

283
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,700
I don’t tell lies – it’s a fact.

284
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:03,679
I’ll give you an example, if Wolfgang allows
Me to say that.

285
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:14,919
Wolfgang was with Me when we were traveling
from Prague to Vienna and the plane, you see,

286
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:18,429
he told Me that the plane is at ten-thirty,
but it was at nine-thirty; it was a mistake.

287
00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:22,900
It’s all right, there can be mistake, of
course, that also is Shri Krishna’s style.

288
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:26,799
You can always do mistakes, doesn’t matter.

289
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:33,600
So we reached – I mean, why all these things
happen, see, to create an event, a ghatna.

290
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:39,390
So he was very upset about it that he told
Me a wrong time, and I reached there about

291
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:40,440
fifteen minutes late.

292
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:45,250
And there was a ground hostess, horrible,
she started shouting at Me, saying all kinds,

293
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:48,580
“It’s not fair, You don’t know,” this,
that and everything.

294
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:54,900
I just didn’t bother about it because I
knew that it was out of mistake we’ve done

295
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,900
it.

296
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,730
And they could have taken away their plane
instead of shouting, but they kept the plane

297
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:06,700
and shouted at Me, because she wanted to shout,
you see.

298
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:17,020
Then the plane was filled in with people and
it would not leave, so I asked the engineers.

299
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,039
They said, “It has been like this for the
half-an-hour.

300
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,850
We are trying to correct it.

301
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:22,110
It’s like this.”

302
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,800
So it’s all right.

303
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:31,480
He said that “We’ll have to wait till
we put it right.”

304
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:37,960
But because she shouted at Me, Wolfgang was
full of tears, you see; just look at this

305
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,659
German having so many tears in his eyes!

306
00:28:40,659 --> 00:28:44,610
Then Alga was telling him that “It’s all
right, doesn’t matter.

307
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:46,429
It’s not your mistake.”

308
00:28:46,429 --> 00:28:51,980
He was feeling so sad that Mother has been
insulted like this by this lady, because of

309
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,309
my mistake – I mean, it’s love.

310
00:28:54,309 --> 00:28:56,970
Now the power of his love was so great.

311
00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:02,029
At the same moment there were so many, to
about fifty people, Sahaja yogis standing

312
00:29:02,029 --> 00:29:03,770
on the balcony watching us.

313
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:11,980
We also felt and they also felt, but they
felt a tremendous cool breeze like a big blow

314
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:17,669
came to them and blew upon them vibrations,
and they just got enamored.

315
00:29:17,669 --> 00:29:22,100
And suddenly when they opened their eyes what
they find, the whole sky was filled with clouds.

316
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,380
There was not a single cloud.

317
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:29,419
In one second, in one second from where the
clouds came, God knows.

318
00:29:29,419 --> 00:29:31,799
It was all completely filled with them.

319
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:36,049
Then they asked us to get out because they
could not do anything.

320
00:29:36,049 --> 00:29:39,220
So when we came back it started raining.

321
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:42,140
When we came in, he got after that lady.

322
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:44,400
He said, “Now, whom are we to shout?

323
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,090
We can’t catch our planes now.”

324
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:52,510
And then they announced that all the flights
are cancelled.

325
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:58,970
So see the power of his love for his Mother
that the whole sky couldn’t bear it, you

326
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:02,179
see, the, his eyes became the sky.

327
00:30:02,179 --> 00:30:07,730
And in a second they said, “Mother, we have
never seen such a miracle, that there is not

328
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:12,780
one single thing and the whole thing was filled
with this.”

329
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:16,140
So you must know your powers.

330
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:20,159
That is what is – first of all witness yourself,
is the introspection.

331
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:25,330
See for yourself how many powers you have
got.

332
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:31,070
Now with your left Vishuddhi you will always
conclude, “Oh, how can I have any powers?

333
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:35,440
After all, I have done this, I have done that.”

334
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:41,730
Even if you give somebody hundred pounds and
you tell him that now you go to the market,

335
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:47,850
buy something, he’ll say, “Oh, what’s
the use of this hundred pounds?” this, that.

336
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:49,299
Use it!

337
00:30:49,299 --> 00:30:50,900
As simple as that.

338
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:56,020
But then Sahaja yogis start saying that “No,
no, no, no.

339
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,700
Mother says, but how can I have?

340
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:00,590
How can I have these powers, after all?

341
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:01,870
It’s not possible.

342
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:03,159
I’m no good.”

343
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:08,080
Because that left Vishuddhi’s all the time
telling that you are good for nothing.

344
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:18,010
It’s like a leaking hole in your brain that
takes away all the sense, and you accept it.

345
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:24,190
So first thing is to introspect yourself,
and see for yourself how many powers you have

346
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,190
got.

347
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:30,480
Like in the beginning no Sahaja yogi would
give realization, in India.

348
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,230
Nobody would even touch anyone.

349
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:39,200
It so happened that My car failed and I was
late two hours, luckily, and there was a big

350
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,559
meeting and they didn’t know what to do,
so they started giving realization to people.

351
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:49,570
And then they realized they can give realization;
otherwise they would not touch anyone.

352
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:52,779
Now you know that what you can do.

353
00:31:52,779 --> 00:31:56,559
You also know that whatever you say happens.

354
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:57,559
Whatever you want you can get it.

355
00:31:57,559 --> 00:31:58,559
Try, try, try!

356
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:03,870
But if you don’t do it, then you’ll be
all the time half-baked.

357
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:09,659
Take the experience of your powers, see how
dynamic you are.

358
00:32:09,659 --> 00:32:15,150
Don’t have formalities about it, just use
it fully, and you will be amazed that you

359
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:17,909
have so many powers.

360
00:32:17,909 --> 00:32:20,800
Somebody told Me that “Mother, You have
given a siddhi to Guido.”

361
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,929
I have given siddhi to all of you.

362
00:32:23,929 --> 00:32:28,140
I never discriminate; but it’s only he is
very brave, he’s used it left and right.

363
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,539
He uses left and right.

364
00:32:30,539 --> 00:32:33,299
If you do not use your siddhis, what can I
do?

365
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:39,200
I’ve given you all the siddhis, no doubt
about it, so try.

366
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,159
Like in the beginning Baba Mama told Me that
“How can I write a poem?

367
00:32:43,159 --> 00:32:47,990
I feel like writing but I am rather frightened,
because I could not even write an essay.”

368
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:54,440
I used to write essay for all My brothers,
you see, when they were studying.

369
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,919
I was very good at languages.

370
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:59,919
But that’s what he said, and now look at
him!

371
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:02,649
I told him, “You go ahead and write whatever
you write.”

372
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:05,180
He said, “I may write something wrong.”

373
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,440
“It doesn’t matter.

374
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,440
Write it.”

375
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,360
In the same way, somebody wants to paint something,
one should not think how they will criticize

376
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:16,900
or anything – just paint.

377
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,120
If you want to sing, just sing.

378
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:23,000
If you want to do anything, any manifestation,
just do it boldly.

379
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,560
Go in a big way.

380
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:28,309
You’ll be amazed at yourself how you have
achieved it and how you are doing it.

381
00:33:28,309 --> 00:33:31,730
It has worked with so many artists, you know
that.

382
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:37,340
That day Debu told you about himself, and
in so many they can tell you that this has

383
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,600
happened to them.

384
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,659
So now the first thing is to know that you
have powers.

385
00:33:41,659 --> 00:33:43,150
Now believe in them.

386
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:44,200
Have faith in yourself.

387
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:49,279
If you have left Vishuddhi, this Vishnumaya
won’t work out.

388
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,600
But be like Vishnumaya.

389
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,540
Just give up this guilt.

390
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:56,029
“No, I am a Sahaja yogi.

391
00:33:56,029 --> 00:33:58,480
I’m not an ordinary person.”

392
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:03,120
People sometimes talk to Me and I say, “Do
you know what you are?”

393
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,120
“What, Mother?”

394
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,330
“You are a Sahaja yogi.”

395
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:09,389
“Oh, I forgot.”

396
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:14,489
“Now go and do it.”

397
00:34:14,489 --> 00:34:22,279
And the another style of this left Vishuddhi
is this, which one must understand, that it

398
00:34:22,279 --> 00:34:24,019
tries to give an explanation.

399
00:34:24,019 --> 00:34:28,460
As I told you many a time, you tell somebody
that telephone to someone.

400
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:31,649
First they will say, “He may not be there,
Mother.”

401
00:34:31,649 --> 00:34:32,899
“Baba, you telephone!

402
00:34:32,899 --> 00:34:38,690
First find out if he may be there or may not
be there.”

403
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:40,829
But they would not.

404
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:44,139
They would just avoid, and that is another
thing.

405
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:46,899
Vishnumaya never avoids, you have seen that.

406
00:34:46,899 --> 00:34:52,450
Once She has to shine She shines, wherever
She is, whatever She is.

407
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:55,280
So in the same way we have to be like that.

408
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:01,739
We have to know that we are special people,
we are chosen, we are angelic and that we

409
00:35:01,739 --> 00:35:06,430
have entered into the Kingdom of God, and
it will all work out.

410
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:09,400
Sahaja Yoga is not meant for useless people.

411
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:14,859
As I told you, in Marathi, Tukaram has said,
“Yeddya gabalyache kam nave.”

412
00:35:14,859 --> 00:35:17,839
It’s not meant for lunatics and lousy people.

413
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:22,259
It’s meant for somebody who has tyala pahijet
jatiche.

414
00:35:22,259 --> 00:35:24,579
You need people of character.

415
00:35:24,579 --> 00:35:31,500
I know that there cannot be many like that,
but there is no place in God’s realm for

416
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,940
many people, for all these useless people.

417
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:38,219
It’s only for something special.

418
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:42,690
These seats are reserved and you have got
your realization now, somehow.

419
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:48,740
So now try to understand that this Vishnumaya
Principle has to be expressed and has to be

420
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:52,459
shown, and you introspect yourself: have I
done that or not?

421
00:35:52,459 --> 00:35:57,000
Don’t be afraid that they say that “But
our ego will come up.”

422
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Doesn’t matter.

423
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,760
You will also see your ego.

424
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:07,390
This is the second part of Shri Krishna’s
play, that in this Krita Yuga you see your

425
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:08,390
ego.

426
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:15,089
There was a lady who was rather not very kind
to some Maharashtrian ladies.

427
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:17,910
So I told her, “You have got right side.”

428
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:18,910
She wouldn’t believe.

429
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:24,549
She came to see Me in Rome, and she fell down
on right side, completely.

430
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:30,009
Then she realized that her right side was
not all right.

431
00:36:30,009 --> 00:36:36,039
So to know that, whether you have a right
or a left, there’s a very good method, is

432
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:37,039
of meditation.

433
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:45,049
Now the third situation is that you must accept
whatever is wrong with you.

434
00:36:45,049 --> 00:36:50,460
If you do not accept, then you have not been
kind to yourself.

435
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:56,859
That is the central part of it, that you must
accept, “Yes, this is something wrong with

436
00:36:56,859 --> 00:36:57,859
me.

437
00:36:57,859 --> 00:37:03,569
I have gone in this part I’m wrong, of my
Vishuddhi, or that part I’m wrong.

438
00:37:03,569 --> 00:37:06,069
So now I have to improve.”

439
00:37:06,069 --> 00:37:11,430
Now, right Vishuddhi people will always try
to correct Me.

440
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:12,430
I’ve seen it.

441
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,609
It’s very simple for them.

442
00:37:14,609 --> 00:37:16,799
If I say anything, “No.”

443
00:37:16,799 --> 00:37:17,799
First words.

444
00:37:17,799 --> 00:37:19,609
Different types “no’s” there are.

445
00:37:19,609 --> 00:37:20,619
Sometimes, “No!”

446
00:37:20,619 --> 00:37:31,150
Sometimes it is “No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no!”

447
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:41,059
They will contradict Me or try to put their
own idea, and then they discover that it was

448
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:43,459
wrong; they should not have said it.

449
00:37:43,459 --> 00:37:48,950
Say for example, if I say, “I saw these
things lying here.”

450
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:50,279
They said, “No.”

451
00:37:50,279 --> 00:37:57,150
I said, “I saw with My own eyes and once
I see something, you know, it’s registers,

452
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,170
it’s there.”

453
00:37:58,170 --> 00:37:59,170
“No.”

454
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:01,349
I say, “All right, just try to find out.”

455
00:38:01,349 --> 00:38:02,349
“It’s there.

456
00:38:02,349 --> 00:38:05,359
How is it we didn’t see?”

457
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:10,849
I said, “Because your ‘no’ was written
on your eyes, I think, you couldn’t see

458
00:38:10,849 --> 00:38:11,849
anything.”

459
00:38:11,849 --> 00:38:16,940
And then they’ll pull their ears – that’s
the best.

460
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:22,890
But if you see that “This is a habit I have
of saying no to things.”

461
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:27,079
So first of all, I also test you.

462
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:31,819
Supposing I say it is just now nine o’clock
in the night, you just say yes; let’s see

463
00:38:31,819 --> 00:38:33,050
what happens.

464
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:34,900
Try to see.

465
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:45,000
You see, I test you many a times like this
and then I see that some people – if I say

466
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,799
so, all right, if it’s so, if Mother has
said, it is so.

467
00:38:49,799 --> 00:38:53,959
And then it starts building up their faith
very well.

468
00:38:53,959 --> 00:39:06,380
I can see they’re, clearly how they are
coming into the realm of real faith, and there

469
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,660
when I say something absurd they’ll just
smile.

470
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:14,579
They know it is Mother is just testing us,
you see, so they just smile.

471
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:18,480
They wouldn’t do anything, but they’ll
just smile.

472
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:23,950
And then if it is so and if they don’t know,
they’ll say, “Yes, it must be.

473
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:27,410
Mother must have done this or said so.”

474
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:30,079
So your testing time is there.

475
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:31,589
You have to test yourself.

476
00:39:31,589 --> 00:39:36,789
As Mohammed Sahib has said, that your hands
will speak and they’ll give witness against

477
00:39:36,789 --> 00:39:39,979
you – so on your hands you will know.

478
00:39:39,979 --> 00:39:44,809
Now these hands are the blessings of Shri
Krishna.

479
00:39:44,809 --> 00:39:51,959
They come out from the same Vishuddhi, and
as you know the pelvic nerves serves it on

480
00:39:51,959 --> 00:39:52,959
all that.

481
00:39:52,959 --> 00:40:00,209
And there are two chakras of one Lalita, another
Shri Chakras, all on these both sides; they

482
00:40:00,209 --> 00:40:02,960
also play into the hands of Shri Krishna.

483
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,819
With these hands we can feel the vibrations.

484
00:40:07,819 --> 00:40:13,089
Now if your right Vishuddhi’s too strong
you may not feel, if your left Vishuddhi’s

485
00:40:13,089 --> 00:40:19,720
too strong you may not feel, but that doesn’t
mean that you haven’t got realization.

486
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,720
You have got.

487
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,029
You just work out your hands.

488
00:40:23,029 --> 00:40:29,300
Now for working your hands, you have to see
that you don’t use them for useless things.

489
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:34,359
That’s very important, because you have
special hands.

490
00:40:34,359 --> 00:40:41,140
These hands are the ones with which you spread
the collectivity.

491
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:52,319
Now for example, Italy example this: here
the people when they talk, they’ll go on

492
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:56,690
… They don’t know anything what they are
saying, they only know their own, all their

493
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:59,119
gestures, and they only can depict.

494
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:05,420
For a person who doesn’t know them, on they’ll
go on like this, like this, all the time.

495
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:06,760
So this should be reduced.

496
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:11,400
There’s no need to use your hands so much
all the time, like this, like that.

497
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:16,859
Little bit, but while using the hands also
it should be decent, it should be regulated,

498
00:41:16,859 --> 00:41:26,119
it should be 
very indicative and useful.

499
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:30,109
Just showing off your hands is not good.

500
00:41:30,109 --> 00:41:35,349
It is some sort of a theory came out, I was
told, that you must put your gestures into

501
00:41:35,349 --> 00:41:37,789
your hands and speak.

502
00:41:37,789 --> 00:41:40,710
Is all right for people like Hitler, but not
for us.

503
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:42,859
For us we should be decent.

504
00:41:42,859 --> 00:41:46,589
We should, whenever we have to say – now
for example, you want to point out something

505
00:41:46,589 --> 00:41:48,190
to someone, shouldn’t say “do this.”

506
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:51,839
This is Shri Krishna’s finger, you can’t
use it like that.

507
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:57,660
Let them do, means supporting everything.

508
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:00,579
This looks better.

509
00:42:00,579 --> 00:42:02,630
These hands are to be used for collectivity.

510
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:06,759
See, we say “namaste” when we meet others.

511
00:42:06,759 --> 00:42:09,630
To thousands of people we can say “namaste.”

512
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:14,049
But I don’t like the shaking hands business
because it’s no good.

513
00:42:14,049 --> 00:42:16,170
Shaking hands doesn’t create any collectivity.

514
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:20,519
On the contrary, you might get all kinds of
pins and needles and all kinds of problems

515
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:22,239
from others.

516
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:30,700
But when you talk to people also, with these
hands only you can feel them; with these hands

517
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:38,539
only you can care for your children; with
these hands only you can suggest your softness,

518
00:42:38,539 --> 00:42:45,619
your sweetness, and also with the mouth – which
is of course is a part of the Vishuddhi, that’s

519
00:42:45,619 --> 00:42:48,430
different – but specially hands.

520
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:58,210
Your gestures and everything should show very
heartfelt emotions, and then only these gestures

521
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:00,630
have some meaning.

522
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:04,690
Now in Sahaja Yoga as you know, you hold each
other’s hands and the vibration starts flowing

523
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:06,440
among yourselves.

524
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:15,240
And you can also hear the tabla on your throbbings,
so that shows that they are the communication.

525
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:21,430
So these hands, which are really the beginning
of the collectivity – most important, I

526
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:29,999
would say the most important things are the
hands, which act for your collectivity.

527
00:43:29,999 --> 00:43:38,200
As far as you are concerned there are many
other angels and other ganas who are standing

528
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,249
behind you.

529
00:43:39,249 --> 00:43:46,180
They also, they extend their help to you whenever
you want to communicate something, they also

530
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:48,230
do your jobs very well.

531
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:58,089
So whatever is expressed in your hand or through
your hand, they immediately pick up.

532
00:43:58,089 --> 00:44:08,650
As you know that Vishuddhi has sixteen petals,
and all ear, nose, throat, eyes, all are guided

533
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:10,249
by this.

534
00:44:10,249 --> 00:44:17,319
Also the sub-plexus of this Vishuddhi is this
one, is the Hamsa Chakra.

535
00:44:17,319 --> 00:44:23,910
So we have these eyes to see, eyes to communicate.

536
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:31,309
The pure eyes communicate pure love, purity.

537
00:44:31,309 --> 00:44:39,619
With the pure eyes you can cleanse people,
with the pure eyes you can help others, you

538
00:44:39,619 --> 00:44:41,869
can bring peace.

539
00:44:41,869 --> 00:44:46,589
The purification of the eyes takes place through
your Vishuddhi and Agnya.

540
00:44:46,589 --> 00:44:51,309
Here both things have to work out.

541
00:44:51,309 --> 00:44:55,219
The nose is very important.

542
00:44:55,219 --> 00:45:05,019
Nose has to be pure, in the sense that you
should be able to discard whatever is smelling

543
00:45:05,019 --> 00:45:09,740
badly, and you should be able to accept whatever
is fragrant.

544
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:17,989
It’s very important, because nose is the
speciality of Shri Krishna, I would say, in

545
00:45:17,989 --> 00:45:25,680
the sense that He’s the Kubera, and the
Kubera has given the nose to the Goddess.

546
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:36,130
Some people have a bad habit of moving their
nose just to show disapproval or something

547
00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:37,719
like this, they go on doing like that.

548
00:45:37,719 --> 00:45:45,380
This is very wrong, because then you are insulting
yourself, you’re insulting your Kubera power.

549
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:48,579
So you have to keep your nose in a dignified
manner.

550
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:51,380
It should be a dignified nose.

551
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:57,800
It should not be used for doing something
which is undignified, or which expresses contempt.

552
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:01,569
Then your teeth are very important.

553
00:46:01,569 --> 00:46:09,849
You have thirty-two teeth, see: sixteen of
Krishna’s powers divided into, you can say,

554
00:46:09,849 --> 00:46:10,849
thirty-two.

555
00:46:10,849 --> 00:46:17,390
These are your teeth on both the sides.

556
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:22,209
The right side is on top and the left down
below.

557
00:46:22,209 --> 00:46:25,349
That is one thing we neglect very much in
the West, I must say.

558
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:26,430
In India it is not.

559
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:31,289
It is very much we neglect, and that’s what
we have to look after.

560
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:41,630
The reason for neglect is that, I would say,
is laziness, must be the laziness, but at

561
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:45,770
least twice or thrice you must brush your
teeth.

562
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:53,250
Is important, that I need not say, but more
important is to change the brush.

563
00:46:53,250 --> 00:47:03,249
Also you have to use butter, or salt and oil
to rub your gums.

564
00:47:03,249 --> 00:47:11,549
If you rub your gums properly, you will never
have problems with your teeth and your gums.

565
00:47:11,549 --> 00:47:17,339
Moreover, every time in the evening you must
again brush your teeth.

566
00:47:17,339 --> 00:47:21,720
I’ve seen many people who come to Me in
the evening in the program, such a horrible

567
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,530
smell from their mouth comes out.

568
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:28,469
It is not that it’s a disease but it is,
only thing is that they have not cleansed

569
00:47:28,469 --> 00:47:30,069
their teeth.

570
00:47:30,069 --> 00:47:34,549
Also there are people who will not even brush
their teeth, and start eating breakfast.

571
00:47:34,549 --> 00:47:39,319
I don’t know, it was another theory started,
I think, that you can eat your food without

572
00:47:39,319 --> 00:47:40,329
brushing.

573
00:47:40,329 --> 00:47:45,339
Teeth are very important, and one must look
after them.

574
00:47:45,339 --> 00:47:55,499
On the teeth it depends all the qualities
of your Vishuddhi.

575
00:47:55,499 --> 00:48:04,579
So one has to look after the teeth in a proper
way, and should never clench and never show

576
00:48:04,579 --> 00:48:06,950
temper with the teeth.

577
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:07,950
It’s a very bad habit.

578
00:48:07,950 --> 00:48:11,079
Also here is a gesture I have seen that if
they don’t like something, they just go

579
00:48:11,079 --> 00:48:12,119
on like this.

580
00:48:12,119 --> 00:48:14,670
It’s a very wrong thing.

581
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:23,430
One should avoid that kind of a gesture, and
it’s very dangerous for your teeth.

582
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:32,460
So today’s lecture is more sort of medical,
I must say.

583
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:48,119
A person who is spiritually endowed has an
expression which can never be aggressive.

584
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:56,269
He may not be good-looking, may not be very,
a sort of a attractive personality, but the

585
00:48:56,269 --> 00:49:02,650
expression on the face is absolutely saintly.

586
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:07,730
That is also the blessings of Shri Krishna.

587
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:20,680
I have seen people after one year of realization,
and I was surprised how their faces were changed,

588
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:24,799
that I could not recognize them who they were.

589
00:49:24,799 --> 00:49:32,670
The whole thing becomes absolutely mild, soft,
peaceful and very joyous.

590
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:39,299
All the qualities of Shri Krishna can be expressed
on your face.

591
00:49:39,299 --> 00:49:42,089
You can be sometimes mischievous to look at.

592
00:49:42,089 --> 00:49:52,630
So many expressions there are which come on
the face, and give you a very sweet feeling.

593
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:58,299
But some people have a habit of looking in
the mirror all the time, which is very wrong,

594
00:49:58,299 --> 00:50:01,489
because it gives you a kind of a funny ego.

595
00:50:01,489 --> 00:50:06,609
Is better to look at Shri Krishna’s photograph
than to look at your own faces, so that your

596
00:50:06,609 --> 00:50:10,660
face will become like that of Shri Krishna;
instead of you start looking in the mirror

597
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:11,910
all the time.

598
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:17,480
What will become of you, God knows, because
maybe if you go to your past, God knows what

599
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:18,599
you’ll become.

600
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:22,799
So also I’m thankful to psychiatrists that
they don’t like narcissism.

601
00:50:22,799 --> 00:50:27,949
But it’s very dangerous to all the time
watch your face in the mirror, very dangerous.

602
00:50:27,949 --> 00:50:32,890
It creates a very funny personality, that
you start telling yourself, “Oh, I’m Napoleon.”

603
00:50:32,890 --> 00:50:38,339
So you become Napoleon, and start behaving
like Napoleon.

604
00:50:38,339 --> 00:50:43,440
Next day you find one Napoleon walks out of
the bathroom!

605
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:51,950
So one has to be careful not to pay so much
attention and importance to your own self,

606
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:55,440
but to your Self which is within, which is
your spirit.

607
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:02,150
And if you look after that side, then all
these things will happen in such a beautiful

608
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:03,210
manner.

609
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:06,719
Also the hair are looked after by Shri Krishna.

610
00:51:06,719 --> 00:51:13,289
Now you see, you know that He’s very fond
of anything that is like butter, so you have

611
00:51:13,289 --> 00:51:16,680
to put either butter or oil or something in
your hair.

612
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:19,390
If you don’t put it you’ll become bald.

613
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:23,930
What can – I mean it is after all a karma
phala.

614
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:25,819
If you don’t put oil, you’ll become bald.

615
00:51:25,819 --> 00:51:31,549
So you have to put oil, and oil was put always
before in the West.

616
00:51:31,549 --> 00:51:36,029
I see all these old films and all that, they’re
all oiled people.

617
00:51:36,029 --> 00:51:41,349
But now of course, if you don’t want to
put oil in the daytime you can wash it off,

618
00:51:41,349 --> 00:51:46,760
but at least once a week you must oil your
head.

619
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:51,799
Shri Krishna’s star is Saturn, Shani.

620
00:51:51,799 --> 00:52:01,450
They say that if He gets after somebody, then
nobody can be saved.

621
00:52:01,450 --> 00:52:05,349
If Shri Krishna gets after someone, then nobody
can be saved.

622
00:52:05,349 --> 00:52:10,960
In the same way, if Saturn gets after someone
then that person is finished, so we say it’s

623
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:15,059
for sometimes, it is seven years He’s after
you, or sometimes two-and-a-half years after

624
00:52:15,059 --> 00:52:16,059
you.

625
00:52:16,059 --> 00:52:28,079
So this Saturn of Shri Krishna is a, it’s
a quality within us that, supposing if somebody

626
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:33,130
troubles us or does something, we don’t
have to do anything.

627
00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:42,140
Now this Shri Krishna policy, this, we can
say, the Shri Krishna’s nature will work

628
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:44,319
it out.

629
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:53,829
It will inform this all-pervading Power, and
through that this man or this woman, or this

630
00:52:53,829 --> 00:52:58,039
party or this organization which is trying
to trouble us will be hounded, while we’ll

631
00:52:58,039 --> 00:52:59,519
be just sitting doing nothing.

632
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:05,019
They’ll be just hounded till they jump in
the sea.

633
00:53:05,019 --> 00:53:06,569
Automatically it will happen.

634
00:53:06,569 --> 00:53:13,269
But you have to know that you have the powers
of Shri Krishna by which, if He gets after

635
00:53:13,269 --> 00:53:16,239
someone, then nobody can save them.

636
00:53:16,239 --> 00:53:20,819
He’s the last one who plays around, but
He doesn’t forgive.

637
00:53:20,819 --> 00:53:23,069
He doesn’t believe in forgiveness.

638
00:53:23,069 --> 00:53:26,229
He says, “Now, you had enough of it.”

639
00:53:26,229 --> 00:53:32,869
He gives a big, big long rope to hang yourself,
but He never forgives.

640
00:53:32,869 --> 00:53:35,829
One thing for definite, He never forgives.

641
00:53:35,829 --> 00:53:40,309
As you must have seen in Mahabharata His own
judgment of things, you see, He doesn’t

642
00:53:40,309 --> 00:53:41,309
forgive.

643
00:53:41,309 --> 00:53:42,309
He says, “You have to pay.

644
00:53:42,309 --> 00:53:45,359
You have to pay for it.”

645
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:51,130
Except when, when you transcend.

646
00:53:51,130 --> 00:54:04,569
If you become a Sahaja yogi, if you have transcended
Vishuddhi, then He cannot do anything like

647
00:54:04,569 --> 00:54:05,710
that to you.

648
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:12,930
But if you have not, if there’s no ascent
you cannot be saved, you cannot be saved from

649
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:13,930
Him.

650
00:54:13,930 --> 00:54:18,900
They say once Mohammed Gajani came to loot
our country – I mean, it’s a story about

651
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:22,009
the village folk.

652
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:27,980
And there he’s looted Somnath, a big temple
of ours, which had lots of gold, jewelry,

653
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:29,770
everything in it.

654
00:54:29,770 --> 00:54:34,952
So these brahmins were, you see, taking money
from all these people and looting them, and

655
00:54:34,952 --> 00:54:42,920
putting them in the temple and using them,
and the rest of the people were very poor.

656
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:50,740
So it was sort of a reaction in them, and
the story they tell like this: so this Mohammed

657
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:55,720
Gajani looted Somnath, is the temple of Mahadeva.

658
00:54:55,720 --> 00:55:01,439
Now Mahadeva never needs any ornaments or
anything, but they had put this there.

659
00:55:01,439 --> 00:55:10,160
So Hanumana saw that Mahadeva got out of the
temple and was running, so Hanumana ran after

660
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,160
Him.

661
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:15,440
Then at one point Mahadeva sat down, and Hanumana
came.

662
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,410
He said, “You are the God of Gods.

663
00:55:18,410 --> 00:55:19,819
Why are You running?

664
00:55:19,819 --> 00:55:21,589
What are You afraid of?”

665
00:55:21,589 --> 00:55:23,910
He said, “You don’t know this Mohammed
Gajani?”

666
00:55:23,910 --> 00:55:25,589
He said, “No I don’t know.”

667
00:55:25,589 --> 00:55:27,269
“All right, hide behind a tree.”

668
00:55:27,269 --> 00:55:28,670
They hid behind a tree.

669
00:55:28,670 --> 00:55:33,229
So this Mohammed Gajani came and sat down
– this is the folklore I’m telling, folk

670
00:55:33,229 --> 00:55:37,219
people tell – sat down under that tree.

671
00:55:37,219 --> 00:55:42,859
And turning to Shri Krishna, he said, “This
horrible thing, if He gets after someone,

672
00:55:42,859 --> 00:55:45,109
who can be saved?

673
00:55:45,109 --> 00:55:49,299
Under my nose these brahmins were making money
and all that, putting it in Somnath temple,

674
00:55:49,299 --> 00:55:51,369
which was not to be done.

675
00:55:51,369 --> 00:55:57,240
I couldn’t do anything, so He came, and
with this fellow after me I cannot be saved

676
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:00,679
either, so I am running away from the temple.”

677
00:56:00,679 --> 00:56:07,430
So this is the story given by the villagers,
but which shows that if Shri Krishna is after

678
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:12,119
somebody, then nobody can save that person,
he has to run away; because He has so many

679
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:16,839
tricks and so many styles that you can’t
get out of it.

680
00:56:16,839 --> 00:56:21,679
He’ll use His brains in so many manners,
and that He’ll put that person right who

681
00:56:21,679 --> 00:56:24,109
is trying to trouble you.

682
00:56:24,109 --> 00:56:31,460
So you must have complete faith in the powers
of Shri Krishna which is within yourself,

683
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:33,349
which is being aware now.

684
00:56:33,349 --> 00:56:39,319
And also if you have ascended fully out of
this, then He will not trouble; but if you

685
00:56:39,319 --> 00:56:44,170
have left Vishuddhi He will trouble you, definitely.

686
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:47,059
If you have left Vishuddhi Shri Krishna will
definitely trouble you, and be careful.

687
00:56:47,059 --> 00:56:49,869
So get rid of your left Vishuddhis now.

688
00:56:49,869 --> 00:56:51,089
That’s very important.

689
00:56:51,089 --> 00:56:57,230
Because then Shri Krishna will take your test
and will make you so miserable that you will

690
00:56:57,230 --> 00:56:58,329
not know why.

691
00:56:58,329 --> 00:57:03,099
“Mother, You see, I did this, I did this
puja, I did this till, let’s see now, this

692
00:57:03,099 --> 00:57:05,309
is the situation in my family.

693
00:57:05,309 --> 00:57:06,690
This is what happened.”

694
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:09,979
“All right, are you a Catholic?”

695
00:57:09,979 --> 00:57:10,979
“Yes.”

696
00:57:10,979 --> 00:57:12,239
“Feel guilty?”

697
00:57:12,239 --> 00:57:13,239
“Yes.”

698
00:57:13,239 --> 00:57:15,259
“So have it.”

699
00:57:15,259 --> 00:57:16,259
What can I do?

700
00:57:16,259 --> 00:57:18,450
Shri Krishna cannot be controlled by anyone.

701
00:57:18,450 --> 00:57:25,119
He does whatever He thinks proper and He is
meant to really punish much more than the

702
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:28,109
Mother, I can tell you.

703
00:57:28,109 --> 00:57:33,779
They say that She’s Adi Rudra, Adi Saumya:
She’s the one who’s very hard and also

704
00:57:33,779 --> 00:57:38,059
very, very soft, but up to a point.

705
00:57:38,059 --> 00:57:39,479
He is not.

706
00:57:39,479 --> 00:57:40,679
Nothing can convince Him.

707
00:57:40,679 --> 00:57:47,589
Once you get into His control, that He’ll
see to it that you are put right, left, right,

708
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:50,309
any way He’ll make you all right.

709
00:57:50,309 --> 00:57:55,859
So one thing is there, that you should be
sure that you should have your Vishuddhis

710
00:57:55,859 --> 00:58:02,969
all right, first of all, and also get Shri
Krishna manifesting on others.

711
00:58:02,969 --> 00:58:04,630
You don’t have to do anything.

712
00:58:04,630 --> 00:58:06,742
He’ll look after you, everything, and work
it out.

713
00:58:06,742 --> 00:58:11,150
But left Vishuddhi is a disease of the West.

714
00:58:11,150 --> 00:58:16,040
I also feel so much from you all that I sometimes
feel like running away to India, because in

715
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:18,069
India nobody feels guilty.

716
00:58:18,069 --> 00:58:20,180
They don’t believe in feeling guilty.

717
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:21,230
“What is there?

718
00:58:21,230 --> 00:58:22,690
We have not murdered anyone.

719
00:58:22,690 --> 00:58:24,420
Why should we feel guilty?”

720
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:27,410
Here it is a disease with everyone, “I feel
guilty.”

721
00:58:27,410 --> 00:58:34,829
I don’t know who has introduced this idea,
maybe this Catholic Church, but carried too

722
00:58:34,829 --> 00:58:35,829
far.

723
00:58:35,829 --> 00:58:42,219
So then we come to the Virata's point, is
here.

724
00:58:42,219 --> 00:58:48,499
Before that we have to cross the Hamsa; without
that you cannot reach the Virat point.

725
00:58:48,499 --> 00:58:55,920
So Hamsa is as you know very well, is the
discretion, divine discretion, which must

726
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:59,249
be within you.

727
00:58:59,249 --> 00:59:03,839
Once you develop that, then you don’t commit
mistakes.

728
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:09,509
You never commit mistakes – mistakes in
the sense you don’t do things which are

729
00:59:09,509 --> 00:59:12,079
again pushed back on you, or for which you
have to pay.

730
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:15,170
It’s just a very straightforward life.

731
00:59:15,170 --> 00:59:16,539
“It’s so?

732
00:59:16,539 --> 00:59:17,900
It’s so.”

733
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:23,720
With this discretion, absolutely you have
a complete understanding as to what has to

734
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:26,460
be done and what not to be done.

735
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:29,699
And if that is established, a discretion is
established.

736
00:59:29,699 --> 00:59:34,679
In many Sahaja yogis, I must say, discretion
has come even with their left Vishuddhi.

737
00:59:34,679 --> 00:59:38,900
Even if they have left Vishuddhi they have
this discretion, they know what is right and

738
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:39,900
what is wrong.

739
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:46,640
With that divine discretion, the first thing
that happens is that people get impressed

740
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:47,640
by you.

741
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:50,160
It’s real collectivity, it impresses the
collectivity.

742
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:55,269
A person who has divine discretion, people
immediately see the wisdom of that person

743
00:59:55,269 --> 00:59:58,161
and think, “See now, this man, how could
he be?

744
00:59:58,161 --> 01:00:00,119
He’s so young, how could he be?

745
01:00:00,119 --> 01:00:03,199
He’s such a child, how could he be?”

746
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:12,449
So this divine discretion which is the, here,
Hamsa Chakra’s speciality, when it starts

747
01:00:12,449 --> 01:00:20,679
manifesting then automatically you impress,
automatically you impress the collectivity.

748
01:00:20,679 --> 01:00:25,109
This is a very important point one has to
know.

749
01:00:25,109 --> 01:00:30,450
While introspecting yourself, you just see
if you have developed this quality of divine

750
01:00:30,450 --> 01:00:31,529
discretion or not.

751
01:00:31,529 --> 01:00:35,910
For example, there are many I have seen when
they come to the program, they come and tell

752
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:39,160
Me, “Mother, some Sahaja yogi told me that
‘You have a bhoot.’

753
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:41,509
Have I got a bhoot in me?”

754
01:00:41,509 --> 01:00:43,190
I said, “Not at all.

755
01:00:43,190 --> 01:00:45,890
How can there be any bhoot in you?”

756
01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:52,009
He may be having, but the divine discretion
is not to tell him just now, but to remove

757
01:00:52,009 --> 01:00:53,009
it.

758
01:00:53,009 --> 01:01:03,440
So divine discretion gives you a complete
understanding what is the way to handle another

759
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:11,509
personality, what is the way to handle a collective,
how to talk to others, how to impress on them

760
01:01:11,509 --> 01:01:13,130
the right things.

761
01:01:13,130 --> 01:01:21,059
It’s a very, very expansive manifestation
in so many directions.

762
01:01:21,059 --> 01:01:24,519
If you have no divine discretion, you’ll
start speaking what you should not speak,

763
01:01:24,519 --> 01:01:29,430
you’ll start saying at a time when you should
not say.

764
01:01:29,430 --> 01:01:33,530
I mean, you’ll have no sense at all of any
direction.

765
01:01:33,530 --> 01:01:40,509
So to have divine discretion is very important,
for which as you know, Hamsa Chakra physically

766
01:01:40,509 --> 01:01:46,250
as well mentally and also spiritually must
be kept all right.

767
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:52,450
In My Hamsas – we had one puja where I talked
about it.

768
01:01:52,450 --> 01:01:56,940
The last is the Virat: that is the state you
have to reach.

769
01:01:56,940 --> 01:02:02,219
Is the Virat is here in front, as you know.

770
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:11,689
And I was surprised when I went to Nepal,
which is a temple of Shiva there: despite

771
01:02:11,689 --> 01:02:17,199
they were worshipping Shiva they were putting
all the kumkum here.

772
01:02:17,199 --> 01:02:22,029
So I thought that they don’t know why they
are putting, because even if you worship Shiva

773
01:02:22,029 --> 01:02:25,069
you must also worship here, the Virata.

774
01:02:25,069 --> 01:02:33,119
They don’t put it here – here; because
they’re absolutely hundred percent only

775
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:37,689
Shiva worshippers, so why should they put
it here?

776
01:02:37,689 --> 01:02:47,849
Because somebody who knows, who was gnostic,
has told them that this is the place of Virat.

777
01:02:47,849 --> 01:03:05,339
Once you get into Virata, then all your ideas
of separating or differentiating goes away.

778
01:03:05,339 --> 01:03:14,589
You do not have any more ideas of races left,
of nationality, of your city, of your village

779
01:03:14,589 --> 01:03:15,869
or anything.

780
01:03:15,869 --> 01:03:22,589
At that stage you don’t belong to any place.

781
01:03:22,589 --> 01:03:24,839
You belong to every place, and you don’t
belong to every place.

782
01:03:24,839 --> 01:03:30,249
Such a situation comes in when you don’t
hanker after any particular food, you don’t

783
01:03:30,249 --> 01:03:40,179
like any particular type of people, you can
adjust yourself into any circumstances, into

784
01:03:40,179 --> 01:03:44,819
any families, into any kind of people.

785
01:03:44,819 --> 01:03:46,439
You can live with drunkards.

786
01:03:46,439 --> 01:03:54,179
I mean I have lived with drunkards – “lived”
means I have shaken hands at least with so

787
01:03:54,179 --> 01:03:55,549
many of them.

788
01:03:55,549 --> 01:03:58,759
You can be with any kind of person.

789
01:03:58,759 --> 01:04:04,309
Nothing bothers you because you are in the
Virata state; because everything is absorbed

790
01:04:04,309 --> 01:04:07,579
by the Virat, and you do not feel anything.

791
01:04:07,579 --> 01:04:10,880
Whatever sort of person may be, you do not
feel it.

792
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:16,650
The Virat has to suffer, not you, and that
is what is the best state where I want all

793
01:04:16,650 --> 01:04:22,539
of you to reach, and to become absolutely
free.

794
01:04:22,539 --> 01:04:28,660
Nothing can impress you, nothing can influence
you, nothing can dissuade you, but you stand

795
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:34,179
on your self-esteem and understanding about
yourself, that you’re a Sahaja yogi and

796
01:04:34,179 --> 01:04:44,209
that you are connected with this power, and
you are a citizen of Kingdom of God.

797
01:04:44,209 --> 01:04:55,329
At the Virata state there's no doubt left
about it, no doubt, because you become part

798
01:04:55,329 --> 01:05:00,249
and parcel of the whole, absolutely, and you
can affect anywhere.

799
01:05:00,249 --> 01:05:02,509
If this finger is hurt, then this finger can
feel it.

800
01:05:02,509 --> 01:05:11,410
In the same way such a person is felt everywhere,
and not only that, but that person can be

801
01:05:11,410 --> 01:05:13,329
effective everywhere.

802
01:05:13,329 --> 01:05:20,489
For that state of reaching to Virat, one should
try to slowly, gradually, “Ya neti neti

803
01:05:20,489 --> 01:05:22,759
vachanaih nirgama avochu” say.

804
01:05:22,759 --> 01:05:25,069
You have to go on saying, “This is not my
sister.

805
01:05:25,069 --> 01:05:26,489
This is not my brother.

806
01:05:26,489 --> 01:05:28,429
They are all my brothers.

807
01:05:28,429 --> 01:05:29,999
They’re all my sisters.

808
01:05:29,999 --> 01:05:34,160
I love them the same as my sisters and my
brothers.

809
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:35,749
This is not my family.

810
01:05:35,749 --> 01:05:38,719
The whole Sahaja Yoga is my family.”

811
01:05:38,719 --> 01:05:42,459
The whole attention should move like that.

812
01:05:42,459 --> 01:05:47,009
“This is not only mine, it is everybody’s.

813
01:05:47,009 --> 01:05:49,569
It belongs to everyone.

814
01:05:49,569 --> 01:05:51,759
Everybody has a right.”

815
01:05:51,759 --> 01:05:56,809
That sort of a thing, when it starts growing
from individual, what we call is the “vestiti

816
01:05:56,809 --> 01:06:04,089
tu sumestiti” in Sanskrit, they say “vestiti
tu sumestiti,” from individual to collective.

817
01:06:04,089 --> 01:06:10,349
And such a personality then is the most effective
one for any kind of collective work.

818
01:06:10,349 --> 01:06:14,519
I think for today it’s quite sufficient
for you to know about Vishuddhi Chakra.

819
01:06:14,519 --> 01:06:20,559
I mean, I have talked about it thousands and
thousands of times, and now this is one of

820
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:25,650
the sides which I wanted to say, because I
find that still there are people who do not

821
01:06:25,650 --> 01:06:29,109
understand that they have to rise above Vishuddhi.

822
01:06:29,109 --> 01:06:35,740
Otherwise, if they do not ascend over Vishuddhi
they can never be proper Sahaja yogis, they’ll

823
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:37,549
be always half-baked.

824
01:06:37,549 --> 01:06:45,059
So we must try to rise above the Vishuddhi,
the discretion part.

825
01:06:45,059 --> 01:06:51,509
Then at that point we can never doubt Sahaja
Yoga, can never doubt, and that’s how the

826
01:06:51,509 --> 01:06:52,509
doubtless awareness can come to us.

827
01:06:52,509 --> 01:06:53,509
May God bless you.

828
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:54,509
All right.

829
01:06:54,509 --> 01:06:55,509
Shri Krishna Puja is very small that way,
not such a long thing.

830
01:06:55,509 --> 01:06:56,749
