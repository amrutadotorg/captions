00:00:05.488 --> 00:00:11.802
It was really very enjoyable today,
to see all of you,

00:00:12.003 --> 00:00:15.861
in such a happy mood.

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:21.336
What happiness what joy Sahaja Yoga
has brought to all of you.

00:00:21.537 --> 00:00:25.539
It’s really, I could never have imagined,

00:00:25.716 --> 00:00:31.329
that people could be that joyous and

00:00:32.935 --> 00:00:39.959
that relaxed, as you were this evening.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.013
Also it shows, how much you have
understood,

00:00:47.426 --> 00:00:52.847
the stupidity of this hypocrisy going on
in the Name of God.

00:00:53.048 --> 00:00:56.192
Not only that, that you have understood,

00:00:56.393 --> 00:01:02.761
but the way you have depicted it,
showed also

00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:09.085
your great art of acting,

00:01:09.286 --> 00:01:16.213
art of bringing out the salient points
of all this hypocrisy.

00:01:16.445 --> 00:01:22.432
There are many people who can see
this point, not that only we see,

00:01:22.633 --> 00:01:26.882
many people must be knowing about it also,

00:01:27.083 --> 00:01:38.736
but you have the power now to accept it,
understand it,

00:01:38.937 --> 00:01:49.291
and realize it, as the truth, that they are
really hypocrites.

00:01:49.492 --> 00:01:57.894
We have human beings, who of course,
do not want to accept,

00:01:58.095 --> 00:02:02.009
do not want to see. They have closed
their eyes, blind faith

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.546
in all those hypocritical people, somehow
or other,

00:02:06.747 --> 00:02:11.072
they lack reasoning, understanding, logic.

00:02:11.273 --> 00:02:21.763
But there are some who understand,
who have this full image

00:02:21.964 --> 00:02:29.557
of these people in different countries,
in different religions

00:02:29.758 --> 00:02:34.366
and all these guru people. They
understand it.

00:02:34.567 --> 00:02:45.399
But still, they cannot go against it,
they dare not say anything against it,

00:02:45.892 --> 00:02:53.973
and even if they say, it will be in a very
hush-hush manner,

00:02:54.285 --> 00:02:58.415
not so openly as we did it today.

00:02:58.616 --> 00:03:06.421
Though it was very hilarious, and very
enjoyable,

00:03:06.622 --> 00:03:12.563
but behind all this comedy I felt
the tragedy,

00:03:12.897 --> 00:03:22.692
because there are so many who
are suffering,

00:03:23.417 --> 00:03:32.058
who are being looted, who are being
cheated, who are being used,

00:03:33.154 --> 00:03:37.982
morally who have been crushed.

00:03:45.167 --> 00:03:50.277
And I don’t know how many cruel things
are going

00:03:50.478 --> 00:03:54.578
behind the scene in the Name of God.

00:03:54.779 --> 00:04:02.848
Such a tragedy that is still going on
in these modern times.

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:06.501
But you are all very lucky and fortunate
people,

00:04:06.702 --> 00:04:13.018
that you have dropped all this nonsense,
all the shackles of blind faith

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:20.270
and now, you are all enjoying the freedom
of your Spirit.

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:27.049
It’s something I enjoyed the most.

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:34.556
We have to understand that we are now
in the Kingdom of God,

00:04:34.757 --> 00:04:39.528
so we can see the reality very clearly,

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:47.212
and in the Kingdom of the God we are looked
after all the time by the Divine Power.

00:04:47.413 --> 00:04:56.677
How it works out, how it looks after us,
is extremely remarkable.

00:04:57.179 --> 00:05:00.628
As you saw one drama,

00:05:03.131 --> 00:05:08.240
one after all these actors coming
on the stage,

00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:15.131
we actually saw ourselves a drama in India,

00:05:15.332 --> 00:05:21.051
without organizing, very spontaneous,
just like it was today,

00:05:21.252 --> 00:05:26.835
but without any organization, a beautiful
drama we saw which I must tell you,

00:05:27.036 --> 00:05:35.145
so that you will understand how much
this Divine Power is working it out.

00:05:35.313 --> 00:05:41.875
You remember we had a very bad time
in Angapur when these people threw stones

00:05:42.076 --> 00:05:49.192
and so many were hurt, if you remember
that night, and we were in trouble.

00:05:49.393 --> 00:05:56.408
And we had filed a case, but the case was
not somehow or other starting,

00:05:56.609 --> 00:06:03.900
and it was the date, something, where
I could not be there,

00:06:04.053 --> 00:06:08.736
but still the case was there and we didn’t
know what was happening.

00:06:08.937 --> 00:06:13.442
There was one man who had come when
we were having this program.

00:06:13.643 --> 00:06:22.767
His name was Anant Beransbe and he
told Me that he’s from the television

00:06:22.968 --> 00:06:27.844
and he wants to have his Realization. So
I said: ‘I cannot just now I have to speak,

00:06:28.045 --> 00:06:30.727
so you can go on the back side and sit down

00:06:30.928 --> 00:06:37.113
and we’ll see if we can manage
your Realization.’

00:06:37.314 --> 00:06:45.140
When these people, you heard the story,
that it was they who had arranged

00:06:45.341 --> 00:06:48.032
this man from television to come,

00:06:48.233 --> 00:06:55.127
those who had been throwing stones at us,
these Andhashraddha Nirmulan people.

00:06:55.485 --> 00:07:00.824
And we didn’t know what to do. So,

00:07:02.914 --> 00:07:09.052
a son-in-law of our Home Minister,
came to My house in Pradisthan

00:07:09.253 --> 00:07:12.703
and asked for Realization.

00:07:12.904 --> 00:07:18.582
I was quite surprised this man coming
down for Realization.

00:07:18.783 --> 00:07:21.599
And then I told him what is happening
to us.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.284
He said: ‘No, no, you can go and see
this Home Minister.‘

00:07:25.485 --> 00:07:30.551
Now this Home Minister is a great disciple
of asatya Baba, imagine.

00:07:30.752 --> 00:07:36.065
I said: ‘It’s really; I don’t know how
it will work out this stupid fellow,

00:07:36.266 --> 00:07:41.515
this disciple of satya Sai Baba [She
corrects Herself] - asatya Sai Baba.

00:07:41.716 --> 00:07:47.730
So just see the drama. We were quite
hesitant,

00:07:47.938 --> 00:07:54.230
and with Me Rajesh Shah, Yogi Mahajan
and one Nalgirkar,

00:07:54.431 --> 00:08:01.804
who is from the same area as this Minister
who had arranged this meeting.

00:08:02.005 --> 00:08:08.388
So we went there. So the private secretary
had a great respect for Me,

00:08:08.589 --> 00:08:11.504
so he called the car inside, we couldn’t
understand.

00:08:11.705 --> 00:08:15.349
Then he came and touched My Feet.
I was quite surprised.

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:20.209
Then I went and sat with this Home
Minister,

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:25.240
and his wife came in and she touched
My Feet. I was quite surprised,

00:08:25.441 --> 00:08:30.156
and she said: ‘You don’t remember me?’
I said: ‘I think I’ve seen you somewhere.’

00:08:30.357 --> 00:08:33.288
She said: ‘You’ve forgotten we had gone
together to London.’

00:08:33.441 --> 00:08:39.638
There was a offer from Air India for people

00:08:39.839 --> 00:08:44.399
who have been doing social work,
as a sort of a reward,

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.260
that we could go to England and come back.

00:08:47.461 --> 00:08:54.363
So there were quite a lot of ladies who went
and the Chief Minister’s wife also came -

00:08:54.564 --> 00:09:00.115
she was, actually he’s Chief Minister
at that time and she’s his wife.

00:09:00.316 --> 00:09:02.069
They were very well known to My family.

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:05.383
Actually their marriage was arranged
by My father also.

00:09:05.593 --> 00:09:13.567
So they were, all sort of, they were new
this western culture,

00:09:13.768 --> 00:09:20.175
very old-fashioned ladies, all old ladies
you see, traveling with Me to London.

00:09:20.376 --> 00:09:24.102
There you see they were so shocked
at the dance they saw and everything,

00:09:24.303 --> 00:09:26.566
they said: ‘What are these dirty people
doing here?

00:09:26.767 --> 00:09:28.941
Why are they showing us these dirty things,

00:09:29.142 --> 00:09:32.318
and we are not dirty women.’ And like that
you see they were.

00:09:32.519 --> 00:09:34.841
I had to tell them: ‘All right, they have
this kind of dances only.

00:09:35.042 --> 00:09:36.787
If you don’t want to see, we can go out.’

00:09:36.988 --> 00:09:40.155
Went out and all of them started vomiting
there.

00:09:40.356 --> 00:09:44.240
So it was such a bad condition with them.
So they stuck on to Me in London,

00:09:44.441 --> 00:09:50.500
all of them, and one of them was the wife
of this gentleman, and she said

00:09:50.701 --> 00:09:55.033
that: ‘If You remember we all stuck on
to You.’ They were all older than Me,

00:09:55.234 --> 00:09:58.369
because they couldn’t understand what’s
happening in these countries

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:04.279
because they had never seen such dances,
such women, such men.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:08.324
She said: ‘But why are these Air India
people troubling us like this?

00:10:08.525 --> 00:10:11.523
Why do they want to shock us?’ I said:
‘It’s all right.

00:10:11.724 --> 00:10:14.641
That is their entertainment style, doesn’t
matter and all that.’

00:10:14.801 --> 00:10:18.617
But inside I was laughing: ‘I said from
where these old-fashioned

00:10:18.818 --> 00:10:23.043
women have come here and they can’t stand
all this nonsense”.

00:10:23.259 --> 00:10:26.986
But this lady said that: ‘See how You
supported us, how You helped us,

00:10:27.187 --> 00:10:32.007
otherwise we were all collapsing you see
there.’ So this lady was very sweet

00:10:32.208 --> 00:10:35.098
and then she started telling her husband:
‘You know She was quite young

00:10:35.299 --> 00:10:38.388
but She was very wise and She looked
after us,

00:10:38.589 --> 00:10:41.637
and She did this and She was the youngest
and all (that).’

00:10:41.838 --> 00:10:46.394
Then suddenly one girl, now one by one on
the stage, first of all the wife came in.

00:10:46.595 --> 00:10:51.520
Then they announced: ‘There’s a lady called
Nirmala Deshbande who wants to meet her.

00:10:51.721 --> 00:10:57.103
So they said that: ‘No no just now I’m
talking to Shri Mataji. I’ll see her later.’

00:10:57.304 --> 00:11:00.282
‘No,’ I said: ‘You call her, she knows
Me very well.’

00:11:00.483 --> 00:11:04.779
So this Nirmala Deshbande was with Me
in 1942 Movement. Imagine the drama.

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:07.696
She should come that day only,
in the morning time.

00:11:07.897 --> 00:11:16.015
Actually the whole, I mean, our interview
was fixed

00:11:16.216 --> 00:11:19.242
for the previous evening but it was
postponed for next morning

00:11:19.443 --> 00:11:24.101
and next morning one by one how these
people are coming on the stage.

00:11:24.302 --> 00:11:30.164
First his wife, and we had already given
a nice ulta bandhan, the other way round,

00:11:30.365 --> 00:11:34.963
to this two photographs of Mr Narakasura,

00:11:35.164 --> 00:11:41.721
lest he starts pouring some vibhooties
from his photograph.

00:11:41.922 --> 00:11:45.114
Then this lady, this Nirmala Deshbande
she came in.

00:11:45.329 --> 00:11:49.720
As soon as she saw Me she just fell
at My Feet, she started hugging Me.

00:11:49.921 --> 00:11:53.132
She said: ‘How long we have… are meeting
now this that.’

00:11:53.333 --> 00:11:57.683
She even forgot the Home Minister was
sitting there, nothing of the kind,

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:02.457
and they all started looking at her. ‘Oh
you don’t know her? She was our Leader,

00:12:02.658 --> 00:12:07.171
you see She was like a real Shakti how She
faced the Britishers you have no idea.

00:12:07.372 --> 00:12:11.833
You people have become Ministers but this
is the Lady who fought for the freedom.’

00:12:12.034 --> 00:12:18.360
And all she gave a big lecture to the Home
Minister; and Home Minister – like this.

00:12:26.787 --> 00:12:30.282
But this is not the end [of it].

00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:35.192
Then, then she wouldn’t talk to him.

00:12:35.393 --> 00:12:38.941
She was just talking to Me and she said:
‘Oh, You have been doing great work.

00:12:39.142 --> 00:12:42.383
I have heard about You. I’ve been longing
to meet You, but just imagine,

00:12:42.584 --> 00:12:45.433
today I’ve come and You are here after
such a long time.

00:12:45.634 --> 00:12:49.079
Oh you don’t know what a loving Lady
She is. She was so sweet to us.

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:53.305
She was much younger to me in age and we
were so many girls, you see, boys,

00:12:53.506 --> 00:12:58.765
all of them She organized and She was
so young and still She was so brave.’

00:12:58.966 --> 00:13:03.268
And she was describing everything.
I was quite embarrassed.

00:13:03.469 --> 00:13:08.318
So the Minister didn’t know why she had
come there. Then, then I said:

00:13:08.519 --> 00:13:12.266
‘All right now I’m going. I told him
the whole story, gave him all the papers

00:13:12.467 --> 00:13:16.796
and he couldn’t help it, he had to sign
all right: ‘Please do something about it”,

00:13:16.997 --> 00:13:21.884
or something, he wrote to the main man
in Maharashtra.

00:13:22.085 --> 00:13:25.173
I told him about all this and how Rajneesh
has planned this,

00:13:25.374 --> 00:13:30.810
and all this was done by Rajneesh people,
because we have a proof of that.

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:35.729
Then we came out. We came out and there
was one lady

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:40.807
who again touched My Feet, in the verandah.
I couldn’t recognize her very well.

00:13:41.008 --> 00:13:46.836
She said: ‘Have You forgotten?
I’m the Maharani of Satara’,

00:13:47.044 --> 00:13:51.080
where this incident had taken – you know
Angapur is close to Satara.

00:13:51.281 --> 00:13:57.210
‘Ah I remember.’ ‘You came in 1972.
We had a nice meeting in our palace

00:13:57.411 --> 00:14:03.585
and my mother-in-law the Rajmata invited
You, she washed Your Feet.’

00:14:03.786 --> 00:14:08.122
I said: ‘Yes yes I remember.’ ‘But You
forgot us. You never met us after that.

00:14:08.323 --> 00:14:12.618
Now You have to come to the wedding of my
son. I’ve come to invite the Home Minister.

00:14:12.819 --> 00:14:17.503
You have to come to the wedding of my son.’
I said: ‘I’m going away tomorrow to Rome.’

00:14:17.704 --> 00:14:21.707
She said: ‘No no no I’ll take You.
I’ll do this. So all right,

00:14:21.908 --> 00:14:27.341
at least You must ask this Home
Minister to come.

00:14:27.542 --> 00:14:31.703
He’ll listen to You, I’m sure he’ll listen
to You.’ I just kept quiet.

00:14:31.904 --> 00:14:39.724
So, then you see there was a gentleman
standing with her. So she went inside.

00:14:39.924 --> 00:14:45.000
He said: ‘Shri Mataji,’ he touched My Feet,
‘I’ve met You before,

00:14:45.201 --> 00:14:48.878
and You have given me Realization.’
I said: ‘What’s your name?’

00:14:49.079 --> 00:14:54.384
He said: ‘My name is Anant Beransbe.’
I said: ‘What?’

00:14:54.545 --> 00:14:59.499
‘I met You in Angapur. I’m Anant Beransbe.
I was there. You remember?’

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:03.601
I said: ‘Yes of course. But why did you
come to Angapur?’

00:15:03.802 --> 00:15:06.460
He said: ‘Only a sahaja yogi brought
me there.’

00:15:06.661 --> 00:15:09.408
‘But you were not brought by
the andhashraddhas?’ He said: ‘No never,

00:15:09.609 --> 00:15:12.887
why will I come with these horrible
people?’ ‘So what happened?’

00:15:13.088 --> 00:15:17.369
He said: ‘Only four days back I was
in Satara and the case started

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:21.421
and they had taken me there. So I told
them that,

00:15:21.622 --> 00:15:26.139
‘I saw seven people being hit by these
andhashraddha people.

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:35.210
And they were all bleeding. And I was
so upset with it that I couldn’t bear it.

00:15:35.411 --> 00:15:39.400
I ran away from there. But one thing I must
say: ‘Mataji was telling everybody:

00:15:39.601 --> 00:15:42.928
‘Keep quiet, doesn’t matter, doesn’t
matter. Some stones are coming.

00:15:43.129 --> 00:15:46.480
Just keep quiet. Don’t throw any stones.
Don’t do anything.’

00:15:46.681 --> 00:15:50.792
He told there in the Court. Can you imagine
this fellow, in our absence?

00:15:50.993 --> 00:15:54.083
And after one year I met him and then
they started saying:

00:15:54.284 --> 00:15:58.690
‘Oh Mataji must have given him lakhs of
rupees, that’s why he’s talking like this.’

00:15:58.891 --> 00:16:04.987
They thought he was their witness, just
imagine. I said: ‘Really?’

00:16:05.188 --> 00:16:12.585
Immediately I told that private secretary:
‘Bring our petition.’

00:16:12.786 --> 00:16:16.751
And we cut out all that was written
against this Anant Beransbe,

00:16:16.952 --> 00:16:23.088
otherwise he would have been in trouble.
Imagine. And then said: ‘Really?’

00:16:23.289 --> 00:16:26.901
Then this lady came out she said: ‘Why
don’t You come in and tell the Home Minister

00:16:27.102 --> 00:16:30.563
to come to attend my son’s wedding?
At least he should do, Mother.’

00:16:30.764 --> 00:16:33.901
So I went with her and this fellow also
came Anant Beransbe

00:16:34.102 --> 00:16:36.940
and I said: ‘This is that same fellow
Anant Beransbe,

00:16:37.141 --> 00:16:40.357
but he’s telling something else’. And then
he started telling them,

00:16:40.558 --> 00:16:45.953
how they hit and how they were this thing.
He said this Dr Dabholkar he’s a devil.

00:16:46.153 --> 00:16:50.761
And all that; and we had written against
him in that, imagine.

00:16:50.962 --> 00:16:56.091
Can you imagine such a story? This fellow,
this Anant Beransbe,

00:16:56.292 --> 00:16:59.540
who was mentioned in that petition of ours,

00:16:59.741 --> 00:17:04.894
should be there on that morning there
standing, waiting for Me.

00:17:05.095 --> 00:17:09.470
And then he asked him two-three questions,
the Home Minister:

00:17:09.671 --> 00:17:12.863
‘What are they doing?’ ‘Nothing. They were
hitting one after another

00:17:13.064 --> 00:17:17.659
seven people I saw and I got such a fright
I ran away with my camera, couldn’t bear it

00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:22.713
and Mataji was telling them: ‘Don’t hit,
don’t hit’. She was so quiet.’

00:17:22.914 --> 00:17:26.436
So, the Home Minister was quite surprised
at this.

00:17:26.636 --> 00:17:32.130
So when we came out, despite that he was
a disciple of asatya Sai Baba and all that,

00:17:32.331 --> 00:17:36.644
how things worked out that first his wife
should know Me,

00:17:36.845 --> 00:17:41.586
then Nirmala Deshbande comes in, then
this Maharani comes in,

00:17:41.787 --> 00:17:45.391
and then after that, and the Maharani
herself praising Me a lot,

00:17:45.592 --> 00:17:50.873
that I cured her mother-in-law and
all that. And then comes in Mr,

00:17:51.111 --> 00:17:54.865
this Anant Beransbe, and he told them
the whole story,

00:17:55.066 --> 00:17:57.314
and this Home Minister didn’t know
where to look.

00:17:57.515 --> 00:18:00.896
“Satya” Sai Baba and whole thing was
finished into nowhere.

00:18:01.097 --> 00:18:07.459
So see how the drama worked, and we were
so amazed at the whole thing.

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:13.677
When we came out Rajesh said: ‘Mother,
it was Mahasahaja Yoga.’

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:31.649
So in Sahaja Yoga everything works out.
You must know that it all works out.

00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:38.015
But you must also know that you must
have faith in Paramchaitanya.

00:18:38.216 --> 00:18:42.940
Also faith in yourself that you are
in the Kingdom of God.

00:18:43.141 --> 00:18:47.228
I was very happy today the way you enjoyed
all that and understood it

00:18:47.429 --> 00:18:54.099
but, one thing is there, that you all
should,

00:18:54.522 --> 00:19:00.843
not that only enjoy this, but feel it
as a responsibility.

00:19:01.044 --> 00:19:07.717
We have to point it out to the whole world,
how hypocritical they are,

00:19:07.918 --> 00:19:19.001
how they are using the name of God, and
how they are ruining people by their tricks.

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:26.079
So today I don’t want to tell you lots
of things.

00:19:26.287 --> 00:19:30.098
Today is a day still the Christ has not
risen as they say but -

00:19:30.299 --> 00:19:33.569
I don’t know at this time,

00:19:35.657 --> 00:19:42.659
He must have come out of His grave
already, as it is, because

00:19:43.087 --> 00:19:46.435
He came out and He was standing outside

00:19:46.636 --> 00:19:52.059
when His Mother came and asked Him:
‘Who are You?’

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:55.308
She couldn’t even Recognize Him.
She couldn’t even believe

00:19:55.509 --> 00:20:02.601
that Christ has raised. In the same way
we also forget that we have risen

00:20:02.802 --> 00:20:09.775
and that we are completely transformed,
and we are free, absolutely free people.

00:20:09.976 --> 00:20:15.114
Nothing can dominate us, none
of our conditionings,

00:20:15.315 --> 00:20:22.744
none of our ego, nothing can dominate us,
none of our habits.

00:20:22.945 --> 00:20:30.468
Everything has died out and we are free
birds to fly and to enjoy our flights.

00:20:30.669 --> 00:20:34.174
This is what we have to realize.

00:20:34.375 --> 00:20:37.351
May God bless you all.

00:20:39.598 --> 00:20:43.247
I’ve been telling you that you shouldn’t
give Me any prizes, nothing.

00:20:43.448 --> 00:20:47.705
It’s too much. It is too much
of presentations.

00:20:47.906 --> 00:20:52.135
I mean, I don’t know why you are giving Me
all these things all the time,

00:20:52.336 --> 00:20:59.473
but you think that, that’s only your
privilege that you have to do it.

00:20:59.886 --> 00:21:03.144
So I too have certain privileges, I can
also give you presents.

00:21:03.345 --> 00:21:10.295
So I have bought some very small ones
for all of you, those who are here in Rome.

00:21:10.496 --> 00:21:14.294
For Cabella people I brought, bought
last time,

00:21:14.495 --> 00:21:17.103
but I’ll also do it when they come there.

00:21:17.304 --> 00:21:20.810
And for other countries also I’ll be giving
them whenever I’ll go there

00:21:21.011 --> 00:21:26.577
but just now it is for the people of Rome
and the leaders.

00:21:26.778 --> 00:21:29.389
Leaders, I must, I’m also afraid of them,

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:31.940
because sometimes you see, if they get
angry

00:21:32.156 --> 00:21:36.047
they can form a union against
Me, you know.

00:21:36.248 --> 00:21:40.369
So One has to be careful with them.

00:21:40.759 --> 00:21:49.261
So there’s little presents for all of them
and I hope they’ll accept it and so…
