00:05.488 --> 00:11.802
It was really very enjoyable today,
to see all of you,

00:12.003 --> 00:15.861
in such a happy mood.

00:16.029 --> 00:21.336
What happiness what joy Sahaja Yoga
has brought to all of you.

00:21.537 --> 00:25.539
It’s really, I could never have imagined,

00:25.716 --> 00:31.329
that people could be that joyous and

00:32.935 --> 00:39.959
that relaxed, as you were this evening.

00:40.160 --> 00:46.013
Also it shows, how much you have
understood,

00:47.426 --> 00:52.847
the stupidity of this hypocrisy going on
in the Name of God.

00:53.048 --> 00:56.192
Not only that, that you have understood,

00:56.393 --> 01:02.761
but the way you have depicted it,
showed also

01:02.962 --> 01:09.085
your great art of acting,

01:09.286 --> 01:16.213
art of bringing out the salient points
of all this hypocrisy.

01:16.445 --> 01:22.432
There are many people who can see
this point, not that only we see,

01:22.633 --> 01:26.882
many people must be knowing about it also,

01:27.083 --> 01:38.736
but you have the power now to accept it,
understand it,

01:38.937 --> 01:49.291
and realize it, as the truth, that they are
really hypocrites.

01:49.492 --> 01:57.894
We have human beings, who of course,
do not want to accept,

01:58.095 --> 02:02.009
do not want to see. They have closed
their eyes, blind faith

02:02.210 --> 02:06.546
in all those hypocritical people, somehow
or other,

02:06.747 --> 02:11.072
they lack reasoning, understanding, logic.

02:11.273 --> 02:21.763
But there are some who understand,
who have this full image

02:21.964 --> 02:29.557
of these people in different countries,
in different religions

02:29.758 --> 02:34.366
and all these guru people. They
understand it.

02:34.567 --> 02:45.399
But still, they cannot go against it,
they dare not say anything against it,

02:45.892 --> 02:53.973
and even if they say, it will be in a very
hush-hush manner,

02:54.285 --> 02:58.415
not so openly as we did it today.

02:58.616 --> 03:06.421
Though it was very hilarious, and very
enjoyable,

03:06.622 --> 03:12.563
but behind all this comedy I felt
the tragedy,

03:12.897 --> 03:22.692
because there are so many who
are suffering,

03:23.417 --> 03:32.058
who are being looted, who are being
cheated, who are being used,

03:33.154 --> 03:37.982
morally who have been crushed.

03:45.167 --> 03:50.277
And I don’t know how many cruel things
are going

03:50.478 --> 03:54.578
behind the scene in the Name of God.

03:54.779 --> 04:02.848
Such a tragedy that is still going on
in these modern times.

04:03.049 --> 04:06.501
But you are all very lucky and fortunate
people,

04:06.702 --> 04:13.018
that you have dropped all this nonsense,
all the shackles of blind faith

04:13.219 --> 04:20.270
and now, you are all enjoying the freedom
of your Spirit.

04:20.470 --> 04:27.049
It’s something I enjoyed the most.

04:28.050 --> 04:34.556
We have to understand that we are now
in the Kingdom of God,

04:34.757 --> 04:39.528
so we can see the reality very clearly,

04:39.729 --> 04:47.212
and in the Kingdom of the God we are looked
after all the time by the Divine Power.

04:47.413 --> 04:56.677
How it works out, how it looks after us,
is extremely remarkable.

04:57.179 --> 05:00.628
As you saw one drama,

05:03.131 --> 05:08.240
one after all these actors coming
on the stage,

05:08.441 --> 05:15.131
we actually saw ourselves a drama in India,

05:15.332 --> 05:21.051
without organizing, very spontaneous,
just like it was today,

05:21.252 --> 05:26.835
but without any organization, a beautiful
drama we saw which I must tell you,

05:27.036 --> 05:35.145
so that you will understand how much
this Divine Power is working it out.

05:35.313 --> 05:41.875
You remember we had a very bad time
in Angapur when these people threw stones

05:42.076 --> 05:49.192
and so many were hurt, if you remember
that night, and we were in trouble.

05:49.393 --> 05:56.408
And we had filed a case, but the case was
not somehow or other starting,

05:56.609 --> 06:03.900
and it was the date, something, where
I could not be there,

06:04.053 --> 06:08.736
but still the case was there and we didn’t
know what was happening.

06:08.937 --> 06:13.442
There was one man who had come when
we were having this program.

06:13.643 --> 06:22.767
His name was Anant Beransbe and he
told Me that he’s from the television

06:22.968 --> 06:27.844
and he wants to have his Realization. So
I said: ‘I cannot just now I have to speak,

06:28.045 --> 06:30.727
so you can go on the back side and sit down

06:30.928 --> 06:37.113
and we’ll see if we can manage
your Realization.’

06:37.314 --> 06:45.140
When these people, you heard the story,
that it was they who had arranged

06:45.341 --> 06:48.032
this man from television to come,

06:48.233 --> 06:55.127
those who had been throwing stones at us,
these Andhashraddha Nirmulan people.

06:55.485 --> 07:00.824
And we didn’t know what to do. So,

07:02.914 --> 07:09.052
a son-in-law of our Home Minister,
came to My house in Pradisthan

07:09.253 --> 07:12.703
and asked for Realization.

07:12.904 --> 07:18.582
I was quite surprised this man coming
down for Realization.

07:18.783 --> 07:21.599
And then I told him what is happening
to us.

07:21.800 --> 07:25.284
He said: ‘No, no, you can go and see
this Home Minister.‘

07:25.485 --> 07:30.551
Now this Home Minister is a great disciple
of asatya Baba, imagine.

07:30.752 --> 07:36.065
I said: ‘It’s really; I don’t know how
it will work out this stupid fellow,

07:36.266 --> 07:41.515
this disciple of satya Sai Baba [She
corrects Herself] - asatya Sai Baba.

07:41.716 --> 07:47.730
So just see the drama. We were quite
hesitant,

07:47.938 --> 07:54.230
and with Me Rajesh Shah, Yogi Mahajan
and one Nalgirkar,

07:54.431 --> 08:01.804
who is from the same area as this Minister
who had arranged this meeting.

08:02.005 --> 08:08.388
So we went there. So the private secretary
had a great respect for Me,

08:08.589 --> 08:11.504
so he called the car inside, we couldn’t
understand.

08:11.705 --> 08:15.349
Then he came and touched My Feet.
I was quite surprised.

08:15.550 --> 08:20.209
Then I went and sat with this Home
Minister,

08:20.410 --> 08:25.240
and his wife came in and she touched
My Feet. I was quite surprised,

08:25.441 --> 08:30.156
and she said: ‘You don’t remember me?’
I said: ‘I think I’ve seen you somewhere.’

08:30.357 --> 08:33.288
She said: ‘You’ve forgotten we had gone
together to London.’

08:33.441 --> 08:39.638
There was a offer from Air India for people

08:39.839 --> 08:44.399
who have been doing social work,
as a sort of a reward,

08:44.600 --> 08:47.260
that we could go to England and come back.

08:47.461 --> 08:54.363
So there were quite a lot of ladies who went
and the Chief Minister’s wife also came -

08:54.564 --> 09:00.115
she was, actually he’s Chief Minister
at that time and she’s his wife.

09:00.316 --> 09:02.069
They were very well known to My family.

09:02.270 --> 09:05.383
Actually their marriage was arranged
by My father also.

09:05.593 --> 09:13.567
So they were, all sort of, they were new
this western culture,

09:13.768 --> 09:20.175
very old-fashioned ladies, all old ladies
you see, traveling with Me to London.

09:20.376 --> 09:24.102
There you see they were so shocked
at the dance they saw and everything,

09:24.303 --> 09:26.566
they said: ‘What are these dirty people
doing here?

09:26.767 --> 09:28.941
Why are they showing us these dirty things,

09:29.142 --> 09:32.318
and we are not dirty women.’ And like that
you see they were.

09:32.519 --> 09:34.841
I had to tell them: ‘All right, they have
this kind of dances only.

09:35.042 --> 09:36.787
If you don’t want to see, we can go out.’

09:36.988 --> 09:40.155
Went out and all of them started vomiting
there.

09:40.356 --> 09:44.240
So it was such a bad condition with them.
So they stuck on to Me in London,

09:44.441 --> 09:50.500
all of them, and one of them was the wife
of this gentleman, and she said

09:50.701 --> 09:55.033
that: ‘If You remember we all stuck on
to You.’ They were all older than Me,

09:55.234 --> 09:58.369
because they couldn’t understand what’s
happening in these countries

09:58.570 --> 10:04.279
because they had never seen such dances,
such women, such men.

10:04.480 --> 10:08.324
She said: ‘But why are these Air India
people troubling us like this?

10:08.525 --> 10:11.523
Why do they want to shock us?’ I said:
‘It’s all right.

10:11.724 --> 10:14.641
That is their entertainment style, doesn’t
matter and all that.’

10:14.801 --> 10:18.617
But inside I was laughing: ‘I said from
where these old-fashioned

10:18.818 --> 10:23.043
women have come here and they can’t stand
all this nonsense”.

10:23.259 --> 10:26.986
But this lady said that: ‘See how You
supported us, how You helped us,

10:27.187 --> 10:32.007
otherwise we were all collapsing you see
there.’ So this lady was very sweet

10:32.208 --> 10:35.098
and then she started telling her husband:
‘You know She was quite young

10:35.299 --> 10:38.388
but She was very wise and She looked
after us,

10:38.589 --> 10:41.637
and She did this and She was the youngest
and all (that).’

10:41.838 --> 10:46.394
Then suddenly one girl, now one by one on
the stage, first of all the wife came in.

10:46.595 --> 10:51.520
Then they announced: ‘There’s a lady called
Nirmala Deshbande who wants to meet her.

10:51.721 --> 10:57.103
So they said that: ‘No no just now I’m
talking to Shri Mataji. I’ll see her later.’

10:57.304 --> 11:00.282
‘No,’ I said: ‘You call her, she knows
Me very well.’

11:00.483 --> 11:04.779
So this Nirmala Deshbande was with Me
in 1942 Movement. Imagine the drama.

11:04.980 --> 11:07.696
She should come that day only,
in the morning time.

11:07.897 --> 11:16.015
Actually the whole, I mean, our interview
was fixed

11:16.216 --> 11:19.242
for the previous evening but it was
postponed for next morning

11:19.443 --> 11:24.101
and next morning one by one how these
people are coming on the stage.

11:24.302 --> 11:30.164
First his wife, and we had already given
a nice ulta bandhan, the other way round,

11:30.365 --> 11:34.963
to this two photographs of Mr Narakasura,

11:35.164 --> 11:41.721
lest he starts pouring some vibhooties
from his photograph.

11:41.922 --> 11:45.114
Then this lady, this Nirmala Deshbande
she came in.

11:45.329 --> 11:49.720
As soon as she saw Me she just fell
at My Feet, she started hugging Me.

11:49.921 --> 11:53.132
She said: ‘How long we have… are meeting
now this that.’

11:53.333 --> 11:57.683
She even forgot the Home Minister was
sitting there, nothing of the kind,

11:57.900 --> 12:02.457
and they all started looking at her. ‘Oh
you don’t know her? She was our Leader,

12:02.658 --> 12:07.171
you see She was like a real Shakti how She
faced the Britishers you have no idea.

12:07.372 --> 12:11.833
You people have become Ministers but this
is the Lady who fought for the freedom.’

12:12.034 --> 12:18.360
And all she gave a big lecture to the Home
Minister; and Home Minister – like this.

12:26.787 --> 12:30.282
But this is not the end [of it].

12:30.490 --> 12:35.192
Then, then she wouldn’t talk to him.

12:35.393 --> 12:38.941
She was just talking to Me and she said:
‘Oh, You have been doing great work.

12:39.142 --> 12:42.383
I have heard about You. I’ve been longing
to meet You, but just imagine,

12:42.584 --> 12:45.433
today I’ve come and You are here after
such a long time.

12:45.634 --> 12:49.079
Oh you don’t know what a loving Lady
She is. She was so sweet to us.

12:49.280 --> 12:53.305
She was much younger to me in age and we
were so many girls, you see, boys,

12:53.506 --> 12:58.765
all of them She organized and She was
so young and still She was so brave.’

12:58.966 --> 13:03.268
And she was describing everything.
I was quite embarrassed.

13:03.469 --> 13:08.318
So the Minister didn’t know why she had
come there. Then, then I said:

13:08.519 --> 13:12.266
‘All right now I’m going. I told him
the whole story, gave him all the papers

13:12.467 --> 13:16.796
and he couldn’t help it, he had to sign
all right: ‘Please do something about it”,

13:16.997 --> 13:21.884
or something, he wrote to the main man
in Maharashtra.

13:22.085 --> 13:25.173
I told him about all this and how Rajneesh
has planned this,

13:25.374 --> 13:30.810
and all this was done by Rajneesh people,
because we have a proof of that.

13:31.430 --> 13:35.729
Then we came out. We came out and there
was one lady

13:35.930 --> 13:40.807
who again touched My Feet, in the verandah.
I couldn’t recognize her very well.

13:41.008 --> 13:46.836
She said: ‘Have You forgotten?
I’m the Maharani of Satara’,

13:47.044 --> 13:51.080
where this incident had taken – you know
Angapur is close to Satara.

13:51.281 --> 13:57.210
‘Ah I remember.’ ‘You came in 1972.
We had a nice meeting in our palace

13:57.411 --> 14:03.585
and my mother-in-law the Rajmata invited
You, she washed Your Feet.’

14:03.786 --> 14:08.122
I said: ‘Yes yes I remember.’ ‘But You
forgot us. You never met us after that.

14:08.323 --> 14:12.618
Now You have to come to the wedding of my
son. I’ve come to invite the Home Minister.

14:12.819 --> 14:17.503
You have to come to the wedding of my son.’
I said: ‘I’m going away tomorrow to Rome.’

14:17.704 --> 14:21.707
She said: ‘No no no I’ll take You.
I’ll do this. So all right,

14:21.908 --> 14:27.341
at least You must ask this Home
Minister to come.

14:27.542 --> 14:31.703
He’ll listen to You, I’m sure he’ll listen
to You.’ I just kept quiet.

14:31.904 --> 14:39.724
So, then you see there was a gentleman
standing with her. So she went inside.

14:39.924 --> 14:45.000
He said: ‘Shri Mataji,’ he touched My Feet,
‘I’ve met You before,

14:45.201 --> 14:48.878
and You have given me Realization.’
I said: ‘What’s your name?’

14:49.079 --> 14:54.384
He said: ‘My name is Anant Beransbe.’
I said: ‘What?’

14:54.545 --> 14:59.499
‘I met You in Angapur. I’m Anant Beransbe.
I was there. You remember?’

14:59.700 --> 15:03.601
I said: ‘Yes of course. But why did you
come to Angapur?’

15:03.802 --> 15:06.460
He said: ‘Only a sahaja yogi brought
me there.’

15:06.661 --> 15:09.408
‘But you were not brought by
the andhashraddhas?’ He said: ‘No never,

15:09.609 --> 15:12.887
why will I come with these horrible
people?’ ‘So what happened?’

15:13.088 --> 15:17.369
He said: ‘Only four days back I was
in Satara and the case started

15:17.570 --> 15:21.421
and they had taken me there. So I told
them that,

15:21.622 --> 15:26.139
‘I saw seven people being hit by these
andhashraddha people.

15:26.340 --> 15:35.210
And they were all bleeding. And I was
so upset with it that I couldn’t bear it.

15:35.411 --> 15:39.400
I ran away from there. But one thing I must
say: ‘Mataji was telling everybody:

15:39.601 --> 15:42.928
‘Keep quiet, doesn’t matter, doesn’t
matter. Some stones are coming.

15:43.129 --> 15:46.480
Just keep quiet. Don’t throw any stones.
Don’t do anything.’

15:46.681 --> 15:50.792
He told there in the Court. Can you imagine
this fellow, in our absence?

15:50.993 --> 15:54.083
And after one year I met him and then
they started saying:

15:54.284 --> 15:58.690
‘Oh Mataji must have given him lakhs of
rupees, that’s why he’s talking like this.’

15:58.891 --> 16:04.987
They thought he was their witness, just
imagine. I said: ‘Really?’

16:05.188 --> 16:12.585
Immediately I told that private secretary:
‘Bring our petition.’

16:12.786 --> 16:16.751
And we cut out all that was written
against this Anant Beransbe,

16:16.952 --> 16:23.088
otherwise he would have been in trouble.
Imagine. And then said: ‘Really?’

16:23.289 --> 16:26.901
Then this lady came out she said: ‘Why
don’t You come in and tell the Home Minister

16:27.102 --> 16:30.563
to come to attend my son’s wedding?
At least he should do, Mother.’

16:30.764 --> 16:33.901
So I went with her and this fellow also
came Anant Beransbe

16:34.102 --> 16:36.940
and I said: ‘This is that same fellow
Anant Beransbe,

16:37.141 --> 16:40.357
but he’s telling something else’. And then
he started telling them,

16:40.558 --> 16:45.953
how they hit and how they were this thing.
He said this Dr Dabholkar he’s a devil.

16:46.153 --> 16:50.761
And all that; and we had written against
him in that, imagine.

16:50.962 --> 16:56.091
Can you imagine such a story? This fellow,
this Anant Beransbe,

16:56.292 --> 16:59.540
who was mentioned in that petition of ours,

16:59.741 --> 17:04.894
should be there on that morning there
standing, waiting for Me.

17:05.095 --> 17:09.470
And then he asked him two-three questions,
the Home Minister:

17:09.671 --> 17:12.863
‘What are they doing?’ ‘Nothing. They were
hitting one after another

17:13.064 --> 17:17.659
seven people I saw and I got such a fright
I ran away with my camera, couldn’t bear it

17:17.860 --> 17:22.713
and Mataji was telling them: ‘Don’t hit,
don’t hit’. She was so quiet.’

17:22.914 --> 17:26.436
So, the Home Minister was quite surprised
at this.

17:26.636 --> 17:32.130
So when we came out, despite that he was
a disciple of asatya Sai Baba and all that,

17:32.331 --> 17:36.644
how things worked out that first his wife
should know Me,

17:36.845 --> 17:41.586
then Nirmala Deshbande comes in, then
this Maharani comes in,

17:41.787 --> 17:45.391
and then after that, and the Maharani
herself praising Me a lot,

17:45.592 --> 17:50.873
that I cured her mother-in-law and
all that. And then comes in Mr,

17:51.111 --> 17:54.865
this Anant Beransbe, and he told them
the whole story,

17:55.066 --> 17:57.314
and this Home Minister didn’t know
where to look.

17:57.515 --> 18:00.896
“Satya” Sai Baba and whole thing was
finished into nowhere.

18:01.097 --> 18:07.459
So see how the drama worked, and we were
so amazed at the whole thing.

18:07.660 --> 18:13.677
When we came out Rajesh said: ‘Mother,
it was Mahasahaja Yoga.’

18:25.940 --> 18:31.649
So in Sahaja Yoga everything works out.
You must know that it all works out.

18:31.850 --> 18:38.015
But you must also know that you must
have faith in Paramchaitanya.

18:38.216 --> 18:42.940
Also faith in yourself that you are
in the Kingdom of God.

18:43.141 --> 18:47.228
I was very happy today the way you enjoyed
all that and understood it

18:47.429 --> 18:54.099
but, one thing is there, that you all
should,

18:54.522 --> 19:00.843
not that only enjoy this, but feel it
as a responsibility.

19:01.044 --> 19:07.717
We have to point it out to the whole world,
how hypocritical they are,

19:07.918 --> 19:19.001
how they are using the name of God, and
how they are ruining people by their tricks.

19:22.820 --> 19:26.079
So today I don’t want to tell you lots
of things.

19:26.287 --> 19:30.098
Today is a day still the Christ has not
risen as they say but -

19:30.299 --> 19:33.569
I don’t know at this time,

19:35.657 --> 19:42.659
He must have come out of His grave
already, as it is, because

19:43.087 --> 19:46.435
He came out and He was standing outside

19:46.636 --> 19:52.059
when His Mother came and asked Him:
‘Who are You?’

19:52.260 --> 19:55.308
She couldn’t even Recognize Him.
She couldn’t even believe

19:55.509 --> 20:02.601
that Christ has raised. In the same way
we also forget that we have risen

20:02.802 --> 20:09.775
and that we are completely transformed,
and we are free, absolutely free people.

20:09.976 --> 20:15.114
Nothing can dominate us, none
of our conditionings,

20:15.315 --> 20:22.744
none of our ego, nothing can dominate us,
none of our habits.

20:22.945 --> 20:30.468
Everything has died out and we are free
birds to fly and to enjoy our flights.

20:30.669 --> 20:34.174
This is what we have to realize.

20:34.375 --> 20:37.351
May God bless you all.

20:39.598 --> 20:43.247
I’ve been telling you that you shouldn’t
give Me any prizes, nothing.

20:43.448 --> 20:47.705
It’s too much. It is too much
of presentations.

20:47.906 --> 20:52.135
I mean, I don’t know why you are giving Me
all these things all the time,

20:52.336 --> 20:59.473
but you think that, that’s only your
privilege that you have to do it.

20:59.886 --> 21:03.144
So I too have certain privileges, I can
also give you presents.

21:03.345 --> 21:10.295
So I have bought some very small ones
for all of you, those who are here in Rome.

21:10.496 --> 21:14.294
For Cabella people I brought, bought
last time,

21:14.495 --> 21:17.103
but I’ll also do it when they come there.

21:17.304 --> 21:20.810
And for other countries also I’ll be giving
them whenever I’ll go there

21:21.011 --> 21:26.577
but just now it is for the people of Rome
and the leaders.

21:26.778 --> 21:29.389
Leaders, I must, I’m also afraid of them,

21:29.590 --> 21:31.940
because sometimes you see, if they get
angry

21:32.156 --> 21:36.047
they can form a union against
Me, you know.

21:36.248 --> 21:40.369
So One has to be careful with them.

21:40.759 --> 21:49.261
So there’s little presents for all of them
and I hope they’ll accept it and so…
