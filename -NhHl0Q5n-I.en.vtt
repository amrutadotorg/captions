00:08:22.582 --> 00:08:32.248
Today is a very important day for all of us Sahaja Yogis,

00:08:32.282 --> 00:08:37.882
because today Shri Ganesha was born.

00:08:37.915 --> 00:08:43.782
Shri Ganesha is whom we worship

00:08:43.815 --> 00:08:53.049
and because of whom we got our awakening (jagruti).

00:08:53.082 --> 00:08:56.615
However much you may remember Him,

00:08:56.649 --> 00:09:05.682
until you do not know His
special qualities, you cannot attain Him.

00:09:05.715 --> 00:09:16.482
His special quality is that He is the embodiment
of purity (shuddha swaroop)

00:09:16.515 --> 00:09:35.549
and complete Master of the Universe.

00:09:35.549 --> 00:09:40.849
He is the incarnation of the Supreme, of Brahman.

00:09:40.882 --> 00:09:53.982
By coming into this world He has created music (sangeet),
rhythm (taal) and notes (sur).

00:09:54.015 --> 00:10:01.382
By His Grace only people become one with music
(talleen).

00:10:01.415 --> 00:10:10.248
A small boy who came into the world
and did such great work!

00:10:10.248 --> 00:10:18.849
He has given so many things to everyone
and even today He is active.

00:10:18.882 --> 00:10:23.415
Shri Ganesha’s Puja, no matter how much
you do it, it is not enough.

00:10:23.449 --> 00:10:41.582
A lot of people say we don’t see Shri Ganesha, even after
worshiping Him so much, we do not attain Him.

00:10:41.615 --> 00:10:49.615
He is omnipotent, omnipresent and in everything,

00:10:49.649 --> 00:11:01.782
but you cannot recognize Him until you are Realized.

00:11:01.815 --> 00:11:09.248
After your realization you can recognize what Shri Ganesha is.

00:11:09.282 --> 00:11:21.882
Shri Ganesha is Purity, the Pure Spirit.

00:11:21.915 --> 00:11:33.549
When He is awakened within us,
then we have no questions left.

00:11:33.582 --> 00:11:41.415
Then we are successful, in whichever task we undertake.

00:11:41.449 --> 00:11:47.715
We find joy in everything we do.

00:11:47.749 --> 00:11:54.315
He is the embodiment of joy
and gives joy to everyone.

00:11:54.349 --> 00:12:00.182
To serve Him is the ultimate dharma (paramdharma).

00:12:00.215 --> 00:12:09.248
To serve Him means to look after small children, to serve
them,

00:12:09.282 --> 00:12:15.915
to protect them, to make sure there is no cruelty towards them.

00:12:15.949 --> 00:12:21.449
This pleases Him very much.

00:12:21.482 --> 00:12:32.715
Such an embodiment of love,
such a simple-hearted Shri Ganesha, was born today.

00:12:32.749 --> 00:12:38.115
This is the importance of this day.

00:12:38.149 --> 00:12:49.815
Today, if you ask for any wish, then Shri Ganesha will fulfill it.

00:12:49.849 --> 00:13:03.315
It is His right to fulfill all your desires,
because you are all realized.

00:13:03.349 --> 00:13:14.949
Ask Him from all your heart, and He will help you in every way,
every moment, and every instant.

00:13:14.982 --> 00:13:18.749
Today is a very big day,

00:13:18.782 --> 00:13:25.615
because verily the pure Spirit itself has taken birth today.

00:13:25.649 --> 00:13:34.615
And He already had such a spiritual, eternal state

00:13:34.649 --> 00:13:38.449
that many people could not comprehend it or write about it.

00:13:38.482 --> 00:13:49.315
Many people didn’t tell anything;
they wrote only what they could understand.

00:13:49.349 --> 00:13:59.782
But you can understand that just
by Shri Ganesha’s name you get your realization.

00:13:59.815 --> 00:14:07.615
Just by taking His name,
any disease or any pain will disappear.

00:14:07.649 --> 00:14:18.749
He is eternal.

00:14:18.782 --> 00:14:25.149
He is always present within us.

00:14:25.182 --> 00:14:33.149
When you get your realization, you can feel His presence.

00:14:33.182 --> 00:14:37.782
And if you are not realized, you cannot understand.

00:14:37.815 --> 00:14:43.982
That is why people get misled and do wrong things.

00:14:44.015 --> 00:14:51.215
But with Shri Ganesha’s blessings, you can do so many things,

00:14:51.248 --> 00:14:58.815
and you won’t feel greedy nor have any problems,

00:14:58.849 --> 00:15:06.882
because He does all the work for you. He takes care of you.

00:15:06.915 --> 00:15:12.549
Though He is a little boy, He looks after you.

00:15:12.582 --> 00:15:15.849
It’s a tremendous power.

00:15:15.882 --> 00:15:25.149
By Shri Ganesha’s power, several works are manifested.

00:15:25.182 --> 00:15:35.549
For Me, He is the purest ever and My own.

00:15:35.582 --> 00:15:40.282
I trouble Him a lot.

00:15:40.315 --> 00:15:43.248
When somebody tries to trouble Me,

00:15:43.282 --> 00:15:49.449
I ask Him to handle this fellow and to make him alright.

00:15:49.482 --> 00:15:54.915
When this fellow is not manageable by Me,
when there is a difficult person

00:15:54.949 --> 00:15:57.515
and it is not possible for Me to handle him,
then He does the job.

00:15:57.549 --> 00:16:09.182
So today is very auspicious, as He was born this day.

00:16:09.215 --> 00:16:14.282
Secondly, today is Panchami (the fifth day).

00:16:14.315 --> 00:16:30.182
This Panchami is recognized
because on this day we wear special clothes.

00:16:30.215 --> 00:16:41.915
Whatever we wear is so that our body is properly covered.

00:16:41.915 --> 00:16:54.749
The sense of chastity that our body has is because of Him;

00:16:54.782 --> 00:16:58.849
Lajja Rupena Samsthita
[the one who resides in the form of bashful modesty].

00:16:58.882 --> 00:17:07.715
So if you have any sense of chastity, it is because of Him.

00:17:07.749 --> 00:17:14.749
That will benefit you immensely.

00:17:14.782 --> 00:17:23.482
You cannot feel joyous until you worship Shri Ganesha.

00:17:23.515 --> 00:17:28.749
By worshipping Shri Ganesha, your joy increases.

00:17:28.782 --> 00:17:36.582
You become joyous,
because He is the personification of joy [anand swaroop].

00:17:36.615 --> 00:17:51.615
Because of this, we have both things today:
His birthday and His help.

00:17:51.649 --> 00:17:59.782
We seek His help in any work we do. Such is our way.

00:17:59.815 --> 00:18:10.649
But we don’t see what we do to establish Him.
Our attention does not go in that direction.

00:18:10.649 --> 00:18:15.382
That we should also do something,
that we should also develop our state,

00:18:15.382 --> 00:18:22.349
that we should have a state in which
Shri Ganesha is awakened within us,

00:18:22.382 --> 00:18:26.982
through which we may never venture on the wrong path.

00:18:27.015 --> 00:18:32.615
Those who are rooted in Ganesha are special.

00:18:32.649 --> 00:18:42.349
They despise all the wrong things in this world,
and they do not do anything wrong,

00:18:42.382 --> 00:18:46.182
because Shri Ganesha stops them.

00:18:46.215 --> 00:18:50.315
They cannot enjoy wrong activities.

00:18:50.349 --> 00:19:01.515
This is Shri Ganesha’s great blessing,
that you have entered a new, joyous life.

00:19:01.515 --> 00:19:09.749
So today in His service, in order to make him joyous,

00:19:09.749 --> 00:19:17.015
sing His praise and glory, so that He may be pleased.

00:19:17.049 --> 00:19:22.782
My eternal blessings to all of you.
