00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:05.917
All ready so many of you have felt the cool breeze.

00:00:10.917 --> 00:00:17.375
Now, very simple thing has to be done, extremely simple.

00:00:21.208 --> 00:00:27.250
As I told you, the left side is the power of your desire.

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:36.959
And the right side, the right hand is the power of action.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.583
So we put left hand like this.

00:00:48.667 --> 00:00:52.250
And both the feet should be on the ground, separated.

00:00:52.458 --> 00:00:54.250
Those, who are sitting on the ground, are all right,

00:00:54.458 --> 00:00:56.834
the way you are sitting is the best way.

00:01:05.667 --> 00:01:09.750
Now, the right hand has to be acting

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:15.792
as the nourishing instrument for our centers.

00:01:20.583 --> 00:01:21.834
Good.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.959
So as I have told you, there are two conditions,

00:01:25.125 --> 00:01:26.959
that you are not to feel guilty,

00:01:27.125 --> 00:01:30.500
and that you have to forgive everyone.

00:01:38.542 --> 00:01:44.041
So now, first we'll have to put our hand on our heart,

00:01:47.667 --> 00:01:50.709
because in the heart resides the spirit.

00:01:54.291 --> 00:01:56.542
Now, if you are the spirit,

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.542
you are also your guide, your Guru.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.792
So you have to move to the upper part of your abdomen,

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:11.709
on the left-hand side.

00:02:11.917 --> 00:02:15.208
[This is?] the center of your mastery.

00:02:23.583 --> 00:02:29.875
Left hand towards me, left towards me, left hand, and right.

00:02:30.834 --> 00:02:33.875
Now, then you have to move your right hand

00:02:34.041 --> 00:02:36.542
in the lower portion of your abdomen,

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.542
which is the center of pure knowledge.

00:02:46.792 --> 00:02:48.709
Pure knowledge is the one,

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.917
that manifests through our central nervous system.

00:02:52.083 --> 00:02:55.083
And we can feel the cool breeze,

00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:58.000
we can feel the all-pervading power,

00:02:58.208 --> 00:03:01.083
and so many things are, ah ...

00:03:01.375 --> 00:03:05.667
they become part and parcel within ourselves, the experience.

00:03:16.041 --> 00:03:17.999
Again, now we have to take it up

00:03:18.166 --> 00:03:20.667
in the upper part of our abdomen, on the left-hand side.

00:03:20.875 --> 00:03:23.333
We are only working on the left-hand side.

00:03:29.291 --> 00:03:33.999
Then we have to raise our right hand on our heart.

00:03:38.792 --> 00:03:40.792
Then we have to take our right hand

00:03:40.999 --> 00:03:45.417
in the corner of our neck and our shoulder

00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:48.750
and turn our head to our right.

00:03:54.834 --> 00:03:56.041
Turn your head to your right.

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.625
Now, this is the center you catch, when you feel guilty.

00:04:05.542 --> 00:04:08.458
A very dangerous thing, because it gives you angina,

00:04:08.667 --> 00:04:12.041
it gives you spondylitis, it gives you so many problems.

00:04:15.583 --> 00:04:21.083
Now, you have to take your hand and put it across on your forehead.

00:04:24.542 --> 00:04:27.417
This is the center of forgiveness.

00:04:31.542 --> 00:04:35.625
You have to take your hand on the backside of your head,

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:43.250
and put your head slowly on it.

00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:52.417
Now, this is the center for asking forgiveness.

00:04:56.417 --> 00:04:58.041
Now, stretch your hand

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.250
and put the center of your balm

00:05:00.458 --> 00:05:03.291
on top of the fontanel bone area,

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.375
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

00:05:14.166 --> 00:05:18.417
Now press it hard and push back your fingers.

00:05:21.625 --> 00:05:24.792
And move it seven times clockwise.

00:05:33.458 --> 00:05:37.834
Push back your fingers and with pressure move it.

00:05:48.375 --> 00:05:50.000
That's all we have to do

00:05:50.208 --> 00:05:51.875
and now we have to close our eyes

00:05:52.041 --> 00:05:56.125
and please don't open your eyes, till I tell you.

00:06:02.041 --> 00:06:05.583
Ah, you can take out your spectacles, if you want.

00:06:09.041 --> 00:06:11.917
You have to sit very comfortably,

00:06:12.125 --> 00:06:14.542
not bending, nor stretching too much,

00:06:14.792 --> 00:06:16.959
but in a simple manner,

00:06:17.125 --> 00:06:21.750
and you have to keep your both the feet apart from each other.

00:06:31.458 --> 00:06:35.083
Now, please put your left hand towards me.

00:06:38.083 --> 00:06:40.959
So keep it comfortably, throughout.

00:06:45.542 --> 00:06:48.834
Now, put your right hand on your heart.

00:06:52.625 --> 00:06:54.583
Close your eyes, please.

00:06:56.166 --> 00:06:58.875
And don't open them, till I tell you.

00:07:02.125 --> 00:07:07.583
Now, please ask me a very fundamental question,

00:07:07.959 --> 00:07:11.291
putting the hand on your heart, three times.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.125
You can call me, Shri Mataji or Mother.

00:07:14.333 --> 00:07:17.917
"Mother, am I the spirit?"

00:07:33.542 --> 00:07:35.208
Now, as I have told you,

00:07:35.417 --> 00:07:39.125
if you are the spirit, you become your own master.

00:07:39.333 --> 00:07:42.166
You don't need anybody to guide you.

00:07:42.375 --> 00:07:46.875
So please, put your right hand on the upper portion of your abdomen

00:07:47.083 --> 00:07:51.834
and ask a question three times:

00:07:52.333 --> 00:07:56.208
"Mother, am I my own master?"

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:23.792
Now, you have to know, that I cannot cross over your freedom.

00:08:23.999 --> 00:08:25.417
I have to respect it.

00:08:25.625 --> 00:08:30.000
In your own glory you have to ask for pure knowledge.

00:08:30.208 --> 00:08:33.041
I cannot force on you.

00:08:42.875 --> 00:08:45.000
So please, take your right hand

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:49.792
in the lower portion of your abdomen, on the left-hand side.

00:08:56.667 --> 00:08:58.500
Here you have to say six times,

00:08:58.709 --> 00:09:01.542
because this center has got six petals,

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.917
six times you have to say:

00:09:04.083 --> 00:09:08.250
"Mother, please give me pure knowledge."

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:22.875
As soon as you have asked for pure knowledge,

00:09:23.041 --> 00:09:29.041
this power, Kundalini-power of pure desire, starts rising.

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:33.208
So, we have to give, ah ...

00:09:33.709 --> 00:09:36.041
... nourishment to higher centers,

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:41.417
so they make it easy for the Kundalini, to pass through.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.125
Now, raise your right hand

00:10:00.333 --> 00:10:05.375
in the, on the left-hand side of your abdomen, in the upper part,

00:10:05.625 --> 00:10:07.999
and press it hard.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:19.125
This is the center of your mastery.

00:10:19.333 --> 00:10:22.083
So, here you have to say, with full confidence,

00:10:22.291 --> 00:10:24.417
with full confidence, ten times:

00:10:24.625 --> 00:10:28.667
"Mother, I am my own master."

00:10:37.792 --> 00:10:40.667
Please, say it ten times.

00:10:45.083 --> 00:10:48.999
Now, the truth about you is,

00:10:49.291 --> 00:10:52.083
that you are not this body,

00:10:52.333 --> 00:10:56.834
you are not this mind, you are not this intellect.

00:11:05.625 --> 00:11:09.291
You are not these emotions,

00:11:09.625 --> 00:11:12.875
you are not your conditionings or ego,

00:11:13.083 --> 00:11:16.041
but you are pure spirit.

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:27.458
So raise your right hand on your heart,

00:11:27.667 --> 00:11:30.125
and say it with full confidence:

00:11:30.333 --> 00:11:32.542
"Mother, I am the spirit."

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:35.417
Please, say it twelve times.

00:12:03.999 --> 00:12:05.750
We have to know,

00:12:05.959 --> 00:12:14.709
that the divine is the ocean of love and compassion.

00:12:22.333 --> 00:12:27.999
It is the ocean of joy and bliss.

00:12:31.333 --> 00:12:36.208
But above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness.

00:12:40.583 --> 00:12:45.375
So, we cannot commit any mistake,

00:12:45.583 --> 00:12:52.083
which can not be dissolved by this powerful ocean of forgiveness.

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:01.083
So forgive yourself,

00:13:01.291 --> 00:13:05.166
and put your right hand in the corner of your neck,

00:13:05.417 --> 00:13:08.333
and turn your head to the right.

00:13:16.625 --> 00:13:19.291
And here you say,

00:13:19.709 --> 00:13:23.500
with full confidence in yourself, sixteen times:

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:27.417
"Mother, I am not guilty at all."

00:13:41.834 --> 00:13:47.083
Many of you will say, that it is difficult to forgive.

00:13:51.458 --> 00:13:54.166
But whether you forgive, or you don't forgive,

00:13:54.375 --> 00:13:57.166
you don't do anything, it is a myth.

00:14:02.375 --> 00:14:06.667
But if you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands.

00:14:10.959 --> 00:14:15.417
So please now, put your right hand on your forehead across

00:14:15.625 --> 00:14:19.792
and press it on both the sides, and bend your head.

00:14:28.917 --> 00:14:32.333
And here you have to say:

00:14:34.333 --> 00:14:37.291
"Mother, I forgive everyone."

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:41.333
Say it from your heart, not how many times, but from your heart:

00:14:41.542 --> 00:14:45.125
"Mother, I forgive everyone."

00:14:55.709 --> 00:14:59.166
Please, forgive genuinely.

00:15:15.834 --> 00:15:18.875
Take back your hand,

00:15:19.417 --> 00:15:27.041
and push your head on it, upward.

00:15:29.083 --> 00:15:34.041
Here you have to say, from your heart:

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:40.417
"Oh divine, if I have done any mistake, please forgive me."

00:15:40.667 --> 00:15:44.917
But do not feel guilty, and do not count your mistakes.

00:15:45.083 --> 00:15:47.542
Just say it for your own satisfaction.

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:50.125
Push back your head fully.

00:16:19.917 --> 00:16:25.417
Now, take your right hand on top of your head,

00:16:25.625 --> 00:16:28.583
and put the center of your balm

00:16:28.834 --> 00:16:32.166
on top of your fontanel bone area

00:16:32.375 --> 00:16:34.999
and press it hard and push back your fingers.

00:16:35.166 --> 00:16:37.500
Please, do it carefully.

00:16:37.709 --> 00:16:40.375
Keep the left hand towards me.

00:17:04.375 --> 00:17:10.083
Now, press it hard and move it, clockwise, seven times

00:17:10.542 --> 00:17:15.458
with great force, slowly, seven times, your scalp.

00:17:15.667 --> 00:17:22.625
But here again, I cannot cross over your freedom, I respect it.

00:17:23.125 --> 00:17:25.667
So I cannot force self-realization on you,

00:17:25.875 --> 00:17:28.208
you have to say, seven times:

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:33.041
"Mother, please give me self-realization."

00:17:36.959 --> 00:17:39.458
Push back your fingers, push back your fingers.

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:00.083
Now, please remove your hand.

00:19:02.375 --> 00:19:04.291
Open your eyes slowly.

00:19:06.375 --> 00:19:08.667
Put both the hands towards me.

00:19:10.875 --> 00:19:13.834
And watch me, without thinking.

00:19:18.583 --> 00:19:21.667
Now, put right hand towards me

00:19:21.959 --> 00:19:26.291
and left hand, you put down your head

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.583
and see for yourself, with the left hand,

00:19:28.792 --> 00:19:31.625
if there is a cool breeze coming out.

00:19:40.458 --> 00:19:42.709
Now, it can be little far away,

00:19:42.999 --> 00:19:44.709
for some people can be closer,

00:19:44.917 --> 00:19:51.375
but has to be about the fontanel bone area, to feel it.

00:20:01.999 --> 00:20:06.041
Now, now please, put your left hand towards me,

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:08.166
and put down your head, and see for yourself,

00:20:08.375 --> 00:20:11.667
if there is a cool breeze, coming from your head.

00:20:11.875 --> 00:20:14.250
Don't think about it, don't think.

00:20:24.875 --> 00:20:28.125
Now, once again, put your right hand towards me

00:20:28.333 --> 00:20:30.917
and put your left hand on top of your head

00:20:31.083 --> 00:20:34.542
and see for yourself, if there is a cool breeze coming out.

00:20:46.041 --> 00:20:48.583
Bend your head, without bending you won't [do it?].

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.166
Now, please put both your hands towards the sky,

00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:03.458
and ask anyone of these questions, three times:

00:21:06.417 --> 00:21:10.083
"Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

00:21:13.875 --> 00:21:18.250
"Mother, is this the all pervading power of Gods love?"

00:21:22.291 --> 00:21:24.792
"Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya?"

00:21:27.291 --> 00:21:30.208
Ask anyone of these questions, three times.

00:21:41.959 --> 00:21:44.125
Now, take down your hands.

00:21:47.375 --> 00:21:52.999
those who have felt cool breeze out of their head,

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:56.333
or on their hands,

00:21:56.542 --> 00:21:59.917
please, raise both your hands.

00:22:11.542 --> 00:22:17.667
Everyone, everyone has felt, practically.

00:22:22.667 --> 00:22:26.667
So first those who have felt, can come and shake hands with me,

00:22:26.875 --> 00:22:28.709
and then, who have not felt, should come,

00:22:28.917 --> 00:22:31.166
because then it is easier,

00:22:31.375 --> 00:22:33.999
for those people who have felt, can go away,

00:22:34.041 --> 00:22:37.125
and we look after the people, who have not felt it.
