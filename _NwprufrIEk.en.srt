1
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:06,870
I am in a dilemma what language I should speak 
to you all.

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:18,750
First I’ll speak in English, then in Hindi, 
then in Marathi.

3
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:43,210
We all have come here to Kolhapur to worship 
the Mahalakshmi.

4
00:00:43,210 --> 00:01:04,170
And you all know about the importance of Mahalakshmi.

5
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:17,300
That Sushumna Nadi is the channel for Mahalakshmi.

6
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:33,610
But this principle of Mahalakshmi is only 
possible to manifest in us when our principle

7
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:41,240
of Lakshmi is satisfied.

8
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:48,600
When we see poverty in India we really get 
very upset about it, and think: “When will

9
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:58,630
it be all right, when all these people will 
also get the blessings of the Divine?”

10
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:03,670
[Hindi aside]

11
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:10,800
So the principle of the Divine works through 
Mahalakshmi.

12
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:20,540
It’s a vicious circle that you have to get 
to a point where your Lakshmi principle is

13
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:31,140
satisfied and then only you start seeking, 
and that seeking comes from the Mahalakshmi

14
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:39,120
principle within us.

15
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:49,170
So Sahaja Yoga grows in the middle path, in 
the middle section of the society.

16
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:57,700
Very rich will seldom come to Sahaja Yoga, 
and if they come only, they’ll just take

17
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:03,490
few advantages of it, and they won’t understand 
the depth of it.

18
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:06,660
In the same way the poor cannot come.

19
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:16,810
So these are like the two shores of one river 
that is flowing in between, and if we start

20
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:25,560
expanding it, then we will definitely shower 
the blessings of the Divine on all both the

21
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:32,970
shores, and I’m sure lots of people who 
look today to be poor, and who appear to be

22
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:40,050
rich, will definitely become Sahaja Yogis.

23
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:53,570
It’s such a vicious circle – that unless 
and until you become a Sahaja Yogi, your financial

24
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:58,140
situations cannot be improved very much.

25
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:04,569
But you cannot become Sahaja Yogi unless and 
until you have got your principle of Lakshmi

26
00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:05,760
satisfied.

27
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:14,920
But how do we get our Lakshmi principle satisfied?

28
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:25,129
– That we should see.

29
00:04:25,129 --> 00:04:44,810
That when we have little more money than required, 
then we start thinking: “What shall I do

30
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:47,360
with this money?”

31
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,580
Then some people think: “All right, I’ll 
have one more car, I’ll have one more house,

32
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:56,050
I’ll have one more this, more that."

33
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,080
But sagacity sets in.

34
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:05,249
A kind of a satisfaction sets in: “Now, 
what more?”

35
00:05:05,249 --> 00:05:13,479
In addition to that we have taxations, thanks 
to the government, and all kinds of problems.

36
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:18,550
So people think: “Now, I’ve had enough 
of it, now no more, finished with it."

37
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:21,639
So the hankering goes away.

38
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:22,889
Hankering for money goes away.

39
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:31,089
In Sahaja Yoga you are so blessed that you 
start getting whatever you like, and at a

40
00:05:31,089 --> 00:05:38,020
point you reach and you think: “Oh wah, 
too much, now no more – I’ve all."

41
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:46,050
This is also another way, even before your 
Lakshmi principle is satisfied, that if you

42
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:52,529
get your Self Realization you can short-circuit 
the whole thing.

43
00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:59,729
If that is short-circuited, then also you 
can enter into Mahalakshmi principle.

44
00:05:59,729 --> 00:06:14,330
But in case where your situation is such that 
now you have become overly rich, and if that

45
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:22,529
richness has gone into your head and you think 
no end of yourself, then there are still some

46
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:26,060
chances of you getting into Sahaja Yoga.

47
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:36,190
For example, if a very rich man is there, 
if he gets sick, if he gets cancer, or his

48
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:44,309
children start misbehaving, or he suddenly 
gets a bad reputation somewhere, some sort

49
00:06:44,309 --> 00:06:53,389
of a shock from his right side can push him 
to the center.

50
00:06:53,389 --> 00:07:03,020
Now the left-sided people are, who are suffering 
too much because they are poor, because they

51
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:11,619
are lethargic, because they don’t know how 
to get to their jobs, they have no ambitions,

52
00:07:11,619 --> 00:07:14,249
nor do they compete.

53
00:07:14,249 --> 00:07:21,969
In a way they’re in a better situation than 
the rich, because they don’t have to worry

54
00:07:21,969 --> 00:07:29,469
so much about income tax, as if they have 
solved their problems by having no income,

55
00:07:29,469 --> 00:07:30,469
no car.

56
00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:34,479
If you have no car then you have, you don’t 
have problems of car.

57
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:42,939
If you have no – I’ve done that way; I’ve, 
I never drive, so somebody has to drive Me.

58
00:07:42,939 --> 00:07:45,839
I can go by bus, I can go by rickshaw, anything.

59
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:50,409
But if you drive, then you have to drive all 
the rest of the people!

60
00:07:50,409 --> 00:08:01,159
If you have got, say, a house, you have a 
problem.

61
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:06,529
Everything that you possess, so-called, you 
have a problem.

62
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:14,389
And till you develop a complete detached feeling 
about it, the problems are there.

63
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:21,319
So then what happens to you, that when you 
start, all these problems creeping up.

64
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:26,789
In India specially I’ve seen, people become 
generous, very miserly people also become

65
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:32,590
generous because they become so fed up with 
their so-called wealth that they start distributing

66
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:35,180
it and giving it away.

67
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:41,419
So the principle of Lakshmi is to give away, 
to be generous.

68
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:46,779
That principle starts working.

69
00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:55,350
Then the second principle of Lakshmi also 
works with them when they have very nice beautiful

70
00:08:55,350 --> 00:09:02,380
houses and things, then they want people to 
come to their house, stay there, see; look

71
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:09,160
after, I mean, look after them and give them 
food and, I mean, they enjoy all this giving

72
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:15,470
parties, or maybe money, anything.

73
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:18,610
So this generosity starts.

74
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:20,250
But that generosity also is not very satisfying.

75
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:27,110
They think that: “Still this generosity 
is getting into my head, I’m still feeling

76
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:36,300
as if I have done some great job, you see, 
by being generous."

77
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:45,699
Then this generosity, when it doesn’t satisfy 
them, then they start thinking of getting

78
00:09:45,699 --> 00:09:47,889
to the truth of life.

79
00:09:47,889 --> 00:09:53,190
There’s a story about Shivaji, very interesting 
story.

80
00:09:53,190 --> 00:10:00,020
He was once building a very huge big fort.

81
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:04,810
And people were working and he was just looking 
at them, and he thought: “See now, what

82
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:06,329
a nice thing I am doing.

83
00:10:06,329 --> 00:10:08,760
I have given so much work to so many poor 
people."

84
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,990
And he was feeling quite happy about it.

85
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,360
And he was looking at them.

86
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:21,139
Suddenly his guru, Ramdas Swami came there, 
and they were breaking one boulder.

87
00:10:21,139 --> 00:10:24,490
They said: “Slowly, slowly break it.

88
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,949
Do not hit it hard."

89
00:10:25,949 --> 00:10:33,629
They were breaking slowly, ultimately they 
came to a stone which was just like one coconut.

90
00:10:33,629 --> 00:10:41,139
So Ramdas Swami took that coconut in his hand 
and broke it, and there was water in it and

91
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:46,180
there was a frog sitting inside.

92
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:53,889
Then Shivaji Maharaj realized that when God 
creates you, He also provides you with things.

93
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:57,620
You need not be proud that you are doing so 
much for others.

94
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:03,459
So in this generosity in the social work and 
so-called doing for the poor, also, you develop

95
00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:08,250
a kind of a very funny ego and think no end 
of yourself.

96
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:13,940
And to pamper it also, people can give you 
a peace prize, can give you a Nobel prize,

97
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,930
this prize, that prize.

98
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:22,690
Then of course there’s a very hard nut they 
create out of your brains.

99
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:28,259
That is how even this generosity can be very 
dangerous, which creates this kind of a feeling

100
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:34,910
that we are something great, and we are doing 
this great work, and we are just looking after

101
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:42,019
so many people.

102
00:11:42,019 --> 00:11:49,069
So then we come to another kind of people 
who are really very miserly.

103
00:11:49,069 --> 00:11:51,029
They can never change.

104
00:11:51,029 --> 00:11:54,680
I think it’s a disease, with people who 
are miserly.

105
00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:01,310
They are extremely miserly, and sometimes 
I see the whole nation is of a miserly nature.

106
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:15,589
They talk of money, and there’s no decency 
about it.

107
00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:21,730
Many countries, who are supposed to be very 
rich, we’re surprised that the people of

108
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:30,819
that country are not only miserly but indecent, 
and can’t understand how they could be like

109
00:12:30,819 --> 00:12:33,079
that: there’s no culture about it.

110
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:39,510
Like somebody came with us and we went to 
a hotel for a dinner.

111
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:44,129
And after the dinner lots of things were left 
over, so they got up and said: “Pack it

112
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:45,129
for us."

113
00:12:45,129 --> 00:12:50,649
We Indians, I mean, we started looking here 
and there: “What is this?”

114
00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:52,399
“Oh, we paid for it."

115
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:57,139
Doesn’t matter, you can’t just say – do 
that in this country.

116
00:12:57,139 --> 00:13:01,750
So there’s no shame, there’s no decency, 
there’s no decorum about it.

117
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:08,710
This is the greatest curse of being rich.

118
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:22,569
People become absolutely shameless, indecent, 
arrogant and above all, absolutely irreligious.

119
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:29,129
So one has to fear now, those things which 
are so illusory and look like something being

120
00:13:29,129 --> 00:13:42,870
very, very great to achieve, how they can 
make a human being so horrible, so indecent.

121
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:50,910
Because the rich have no manners at all of 
any kind, they have no maryadas of any kind,

122
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:57,089
and they don’t care for what others are 
going to say, or what they have to be.

123
00:13:57,089 --> 00:14:10,830
So such rich countries have gone from left 
to right, right to left, like a yo-yo, and

124
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:11,830
are still doing the same.

125
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:20,509
And also the kind of a ego that comes into 
a rich man is really very stupid, extremely

126
00:14:20,509 --> 00:14:26,080
stupid, and people would laugh at them, the 
way they behave.

127
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:36,199
You must have heard about the king who made 
chappals out of pearls, and there are people

128
00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:46,950
who are trying to show off their wealth in 
the most hideous manner.

129
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:54,019
To them, to show off their wealth is the only 
criteria, but whether it is decent or whether

130
00:14:54,019 --> 00:15:00,069
it is decorous, or then, is it some sort of 
a very cultured behavior, they’re not bothered.

131
00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:08,010
They are the people who are killers of culture, 
and that’s how we find the people or the

132
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:15,680
countries which are rich, absolutely kill 
all the culture, all the behavior, heart of

133
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,810
human beings.

134
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:24,720
And the second thing they get into is complete 
immorality, complete immorality: they have

135
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,399
no morals of any kind.

136
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:39,410
To them a girl of twenty years is the same 
as a fiancé, whether they are 80 years of

137
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:40,500
age.

138
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:50,240
They have no sense of proportion; extremely 
immoral, live a very immoral and an absolutely

139
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:57,610
low-graded life which even an animal would 
not do.

140
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:05,870
So they get even not only human, sub-human, 
but sub-animal also.

141
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:13,120
So all the decency that comes from your culture, 
or all the norms that are described about

142
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,480
the culture, just disappear.

143
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:22,749
Ha, they may have a decency as to what glass 
should be used for which wine.

144
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:29,480
Or could be what sort of a dress should be 
worn for a particular thing, but even that

145
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,810
is gone now.

146
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:38,079
Anything is possible: “What’s wrong?”

147
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:52,779
This arrogance of a very incorrigible ego 
is even thickened when there are five, six

148
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:57,270
more like them, because a competition starts.

149
00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:02,110
One says one thing so another says even a 
higher thing than that, and the third one

150
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:07,130
starts to compete and says something more 
than that; and there’s a going on, and on,

151
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:18,750
and on, and on between these people, all kinds 
of horrible expressions of their ugly wealth.

152
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,990
The whole society becomes so ugly.

153
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:28,500
It so happened, unfortunately, that I had 
to be with such people also.

154
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:35,610
But thank God I have My own people, now you 
are here, My own style, My own type.

155
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:46,640
All of you are here, so close to Me, so much, 
and what an atmosphere you have created.

156
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:52,870
Even people in Kolhapur and here are all saying: 
“We have never seen such beautiful people,

157
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:54,850
so well behaved, so balanced.

158
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:57,380
They never fight.

159
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:02,400
They never say bad words, and they never hit 
each other."

160
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,130
Because whatever we had known of foreigners 
was this, that they would come, enter into

161
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:12,210
any house -during the time of British – and 
get whatever they wanted.

162
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:17,250
And later on – these were soldiers – and 
later on came the hippies.

163
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:24,550
Then came Hari Ramas, one after the another, 
one better than the other.

164
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:29,640
All these horrible experiences, and then you 
people coming like great blessings.

165
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,430
They are so impressed by you.

166
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:48,850
They are more impressed by you than by Me, 
I can tell you this much!

167
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:56,380
I knew that this would happen when they will 
see lots of Sahaja Yogis together, the way

168
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:02,060
they live, the way they enjoy each other, 
the way they have a nice time, and the way

169
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:04,610
they are detached about things.

170
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:09,500
Definitely they’ll be very much impressed, 
and that’s what is happening today.
