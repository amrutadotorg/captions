00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.840
The other day, on the radio,
they asked a very nice question,

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.480
which I think I should handle first.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:22.880
The question was What is the difference
between other sects and Sahaja Yoga?

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.360
It’s a very good question because
it gives you a relative idea

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:33.600
as to what is reality,
and what is not.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.160
First of all, we should see
what is the need of Sahaja Yoga.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:48.160
Sahaja, as you know, is Saha,
means with, Ja means born;

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.520
is born with you.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.960
Means is spontaneous, it is with you.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.720
What is with you is the right
to be united with the Divine,

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:05.040
that’s, to be in yoga,
to be united with God.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.240
Now, there are people who
just don’t believe in God, either –

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.240
is quite possible, they are frightened
to hear the name of God,

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.680
because of various experiences
they have had,

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.400
the various ideologies
that have prevailed.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.320
But God exists, no doubt,
whether you like it or not.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.760
But unless and until you have felt
the existence of God,

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:32.320
to believe in God is difficult;
one can understand that.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.520
Now, what is Sahaja Yoga?

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.840
In Sahaja Yoga what actually happens
to a personality is this:

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.840
that the sleeping power,
or we can say un-awakened power within you,

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.280
which is your germinating power, rises,

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.440
passes through the various
subtle centers within you,

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.440
and pierces through this fontanel area,

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.680
and, what we call it, as a baptism,

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.200
as a blessing or the grace
of the Holy Ghost,

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.000
you get your realization.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.640
It’s a happening, it’s actualization,
it is living, it is living.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.560
It is the blessing of the living God,
not of an artificial one.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.120
Like anybody calling you, says
Alright, let me baptize you

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.480
and just puts their hand on the head;
it may not be baptism at all,

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.160
because how can he, because he has not
raised your Kundalini?

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.440
It’s like any seed, supposing we have,
and the seed, we say that this seed is living,

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.160
alright? How do you prove it?

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.880
Unless and until you germinate it,
how can you prove that it’s a living thing?

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.040
So, the germination has to take place.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.880
Unless and until that happens,
how can people believe in anything,

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.960
whatever you may call it?

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.880
So, this rebirth has to take place,
as everybody has told.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.880
Now, we need not sort of deny all that,
defy all that,

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.680
but we can keep ourselves open
to understand what is the thing

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.600
they are talking about.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.720
Now, why? What is the need,
what is the need for a person

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.400
to get his realization?
That’s the main thing.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.360
First of all, people have said,
You are the Spirit.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.200
All right, we may be so; why?

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.240
What is the need to be the Spirit?

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.120
We are all right as human beings,
as flesh, everything;

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.680
what is the need to be realized?

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.280
And once you understand the need,
then you’ll understand what is Sahaja Yoga,

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.160
and what the other sects are.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:42.560
The need is this, that you are a part
and parcel of the whole.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.480
Like a big primordial being
you can think of,

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.840
and He has many cells,
and you are one of the cells.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.280
But you are not aware of it.
You are not yet collective.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:01.840
Now, the difference between collective
and a mass system is different.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.600
In a mass system, I mean,
you can hypnotize complete masses –

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.680
they’ll start dancing, jumping,
screaming, shouting.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.440
You can do what you like to masses;

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.080
I mean, if the masses are
of a weak-minded thing

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.560
you can ask them to commit suicide.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.680
You can tell them anything they will do,
if you just want to use the mass media.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.120
Like they become hysteric.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:29.440
Actually, it is a special thing within us
which makes you mimic others;

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.360
is a very ancient thing within us,
very, very ancient,

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.520
that we were – as animals –
we used to do that.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.640
See, you have seen birds.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.880
Have you ever seen the birds
like cranes flying out?

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.200
They always go in a triangular way,

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:50.320
and as the one, the leader, turns,
all the rest of them follow it,

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.080
very automatically.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:58.240
So that’s this instinct we had
to follow others, you see, to copy others.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:08.000
That’s a very deep training to our being,
that we try to follow others, and that’s why;

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.600
what happens, we see some people
going somewhere,

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.160
so we think Oh, we should also
do the same thing.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.400
It’s that competition between us.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:24.880
See, this competitiveness has also come
from the same seed within us

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.560
of copying others.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.160
See, we try to copy others,
like clubbing, now, we have a club,

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.200
say, club of people who dress up
like white, suits and things.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.040
Then there are clubs
with a certain type of dress,

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.160
or you can find, as I last time told you,
yards and yards of black suitings,

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:50.720
walking in elite societies.
I mean, it’s just clubbing you know.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.800
They just want to club it together,
put it together, then uniforms are there,

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.400
and then you have to wear the uniforms,

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.040
and you sort of feel that
you are a part of the mass.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.880
It’s a part of the mass, now.
Again, this is a mass thing.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.280
But Sahaja Yoga is a collective thing.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.080
People talk of collectivity,
all of them talk of collectivity,

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.800
but it is only rational,
it is artificial.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.800
For example, a husband and wife
must live together happily.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.560
Now the reason for that they give is
that if they don’t live happily,

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.280
this will happen to children,
that will happen to children,

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:30.560
that will happen, and that it may be
that it won’t be good for both of them,

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.000
so we reason it out, go to a point,
a rational point you call it,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.680
a logical point where we say,
Alright, we should not give up

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.680
the relationship
between husband and wife.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.400
But supposing husband and wife
get realized.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.920
Then, what happens,
they become aware of their duty as parents,

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.480
aware.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:59.600
Awareness is a very different thing
from just be in mass.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:04.560
Like, husband, wife feel that, you see,
marriage is not thinking

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:12.800
but you just feel it within yourself,
not as a feeling of emotional style,

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.840
but actually becomes your being.

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:20.320
For example, after realization
you start feeling the cool breeze in the hand.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:24.560
But supposing the husband wife
are trying to deceive each other,

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.280
immediately the vibrations will go away.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.360
They’ll feel no cool breeze –
it’s finished.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.080
They cannot proceed more
further within.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:36.800
Supposing a person has bad habits,
say some dirty habits he has developed

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.120
in his childhood,
and he’s continuing with it.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.880
After realization,
if he starts indulging into it,

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.800
immediately he’ll find
he’s feeling uneasy

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.200
and his vibrations are lost.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.800
He becomes aware – means on his
central nervous system

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:55.840
he can feel the bad effects
of what we call as bad.

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.680
He feels burning, he feels
different centers are in trouble,

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:07.520
I mean he can feel it just like as you can
feel it hot and cold on your fingers.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:12.720
So, when you become aware,
then real collectivity can come.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:16.480
It is not a rational thing to say,
Oh, we are interdependent,

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.640
and we have to help each other.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:24.640
We must do this in a way
that nobody should be harmed,

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.320
that we should not be harmed.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:27.840
All this rationality is not needed –

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:33.200
for, supposing tomorrow,
if somebody tries to put a pin through,

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.800
immediately the other hand will go there
and hit the person

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.280
and this hand will go back.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:44.560
All the body will react, automatically.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:50.560
The whole body will react
to aggression on one side,

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:55.120
or any kind of problem, but it is aware.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:09:00.400
It is not doing with rationality,
there is no, it is spontaneous.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:06.080
There is no question
of anybody thinking about it,

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:09.520
but it happens just spontaneously.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:21.040
So, to preserve ourselves,
to preserve our body, mind, everything,

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:25.360
is a disintegrated action
before realization.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:33.120
For example, before Realization,
the brain will say, All right, you do like this,

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.560
but the heart will say, No.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:38.160
For example, supposing a man
falls in love with a married woman,

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:42.999
so the heart says,
Oh, carry on, she’s a nice lady.

00:09:42.999 --> 00:09:46.320
Brain says, No it’s not proper you see,
disturbing her family life is not a good thing.

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:50.640
The dharma, the religion part
in the stomach, which is also a reality,

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:54.560
it is not the dharma we talk of
in the church or anything.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:10:02.755
The gentleman can come here, please,
there’s a seat here.

00:10:02.755 --> 00:10:02.880
May God bless you.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:11.280
So that can be done,
but the realized person does everything

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:14.320
in an integrated way.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:23.760
In an integrated way,
like if he is in love with a married lady,

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:27.280
immediately he cannot fall also,
he cannot fall in love with a married lady,

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:30.000
just will not, he just doesn’t do.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.960
No question of them saying,
Lead us not into temptation,

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.400
you just don’t do bad things.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.360
We just don’t like it,
because you become aware,

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:40.160
and the awareness is not rational at all.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:45.600
We cannot think of awareness
which is not rational,

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:50.160
because whatever is not rational,
according to us, is nonsensical,

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:55.600
is erratical, is arbitrary,
is nonsensical.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.640
But it is a sense that develops with you.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:02.320
It’s an actual sense within you
that develops,

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:08.160
not the way it is developed
with thinking, the sense with your mind,

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:15.120
but the sense in your organs,
in your body, in your being and in your heart,

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.040
that you just don’t do it.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.440
This is awareness
and this is collectivity,

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:24.400
and those who cannot rise
to collectivity cannot be good Sahaja Yogis.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:31.520
And once you understand that this comes
through the awakening of your spirit,

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:35.360
then you understand all the problems
of the world can only be solved

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:39.600
if human beings
become that collective being.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:44.240
That collective being is the Spirit,
and this collective being, if it is,

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:49.040
if it is somehow awakened
in our attention,

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:52.560
then we automatically become that.

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:58.480
Automatically we become
collectively conscious.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.480
We don’t have to rationalize it –
just there.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:10.920
Means a little child will immediately say
Oh, Mother, see, this man has got problems.

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:17.840
Now, how do you know?
Oh, all my fingers are burning.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:20.800
That person is not denounced
because he’s not well,

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.720
whatever may be the problem.

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:29.440
That person is not discarded,
nor is told that he’s good for nothing,

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:35.040
but immediately you feel the problem
as a witness of that person,

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:38.320
and you have a power,
because you are collectively conscious.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:41.760
As you can correct within yourself
you can correct others also,

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.600
because you are collectively conscious.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.720
Means you have the power
to correct another person,

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.920
to relieve him of the pain,
troubles and everything,

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:58.240
to help him out, to cure him,
to do whatever is needed just by yourself.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:03.360
Because, at the point where you are,
at the Spirit point,

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:06.080
you are one with the Spirit.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:11.760
I would say, like, while I’m talking to you,
I’m only connected with this to you,

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:17.920
but supposing I was on a radio station,
then I’m connected with many.

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:21.280
That point of connection is the Spirit,

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:24.720
and unless and until you have achieved
that point of connection,

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:28.720
the rest of your – all your doings –
are good for nothing.

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:32.400
Now, what is the difference
between a sect and Sahaja Yoga?

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:37.360
In Sahaja Yoga, an individual,
an individual;

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:40.240
again, we are all individuals
before Realization.

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:43.680
The other day, as I told you in Easter,
we are all like the eggs,

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:47.920
and that’s the sign of a human being,
that he’s still an egg.

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:52.720
He lives in a shell, he thinks of himself,
he thinks of his family, it’s good in a way,

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:56.880
he thinks of his country.
Everything good, up to that point,

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.640
because he’s a shell.

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:02.400
Whatever he tries to make himself big,
you see, United Nations,

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:06.320
everything you’ve been,
but that shell business will remain in you.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:09.040
It will be there, showing results.

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:13.120
But when you get that shell
broken completely,

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:19.680
you are a bird, you just fly out.

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:23.920
So, the Day of Resurrection, as I said,
the Day of Resurrection, has started,

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:26.080
is mentioned in the Koran, many a times,

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:29.520
much more times than
about the Day of Doom.

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:34.240
This is the Day of Resurrection,
where people have to be resurrected

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:39.440
to be their Spirits,
as Christ Himself has done that for us,

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:45.280
by crossing the gates of Agnya chakra.

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:52.480
Now this is not a sect, because there is
nothing unreal about it, nothing unreal.

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:57.600
There’s no hypnosis, nothing,
you are completely aware of what you are doing,

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:01.840
you are aware that there is your power
within yourself,

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:05.120
and that power is flowing,
and that you become that power.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:08.960
But that power is not of domination,
or overpowering anybody,

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:12.160
but of love, but of love of God,

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.440
which is doing each and every work
of this world.

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.760
For these flowers have come out
from that,

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:20.560
these flowers become fruit
because of that.

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:24.320
Because of that power
people conceive children,

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:27.040
because of that you are born,
because of that power

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:30.560
you have become
from amoeba to this stage.

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:36.160
So, that instinct of the mass
is very much now prevalent,

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:38.880
and used in this sense.

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:45.520
They just give a mass feeling to people,
that, you see, a competition is set in.

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:49.760
First of all, in all these western cities,
western cities especially,

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:54.720
people are conscious
of their money power.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:58.080
So, they use that also,
so you pay some money;

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:01.200
like on a horse,
you pay a certain amount,

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.160
they pay for a sect.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.880
So much money, I’ll pay.
The other says, Have you paid so much?

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:08.480
I mean, you’ll be surprised,
in the elite societies they talk like that –

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:14.080
Oh, these days, you know,
I’m having so much of money,

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:19.280
and I want to go and join a sect –
this sect or that sect or that sect.

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:21.440
Because a competition has set in.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:26.640
Anywhere you see these musicians
and singers when they sing.

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:30.000
Actually, it was all maneuvered,
it was all maneuvered in the beginning,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.920
that they get hold of some people
who are weak-minded,

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:41.040
who do not know their willpower,
so to overpower them and use that instinct,

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:46.000
that subconscious instinct in them
to excite them,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.440
and once they’re excited
they all go mad, all go mad,

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:52.640
and they become hysterical.

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:57.760
And that hysteria is used today,
out and out, by all the sects,

00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:59.760
and that’s why people are so crazy.

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:02.720
If you look at them,
you can’t believe they’re anywhere near God.

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:06.760
How can they be?
They all look crazy, possessed, mad people.

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:14.875
But this collectivity is to be understood
in its own dimensions in Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:14.875 --> 00:17:19.360
This is the second task of Sahaja Yoga,
which is more difficult than the first one.

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:23.320
To give realization is not at all difficult,
because it’s a natural thing,

00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:26.160
it is within you, the time has come,
the blossom time is there,

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.960
you get realization without much difficulty.

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:32.720
If not in one sitting,
in second sitting you’ll get it, no doubt,

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:39.120
but to establish you as a collective cell
of the whole is a very difficult thing,

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:43.440
and unless and until you are that
you are thrown out of the whole.

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:49.040
If you don’t become aware of it
you are just thrown out.

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:54.156
Now, collectivity in Sahaja Yoga
does not mean that you wear some kind of dresses –

00:17:54.156 --> 00:17:58.000
all of you wearing same kind of dresses,
or doing the same type of thing,

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:06.720
or jumping or any such thing
which has no sensible logic in it.

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.920
It is the collectivity
that you feel within yourself,

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:14.080
that nearness you feel, not emotionally,
also I would say,

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:18.800
people think it’s an emotional attachment
to people. It’s not emotionally also –

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:24.080
it is beyond emotions,
it is beyond thought, it is the Spirit.

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:27.600
Because everybody has got
this Spirit in them.

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:30.320
Only thing,
you have to become the Spirit.

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:34.960
Now anything you see, even,
we can say, going to a temple.

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:39.840
Now, in India, ladies are busy dressing up
if they have to go to the temple.

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:43.280
They’ll find out What sari she’s wearing,
what sari am I going to wear?

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:45.200
like we do it in the churches also.

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.880
We go there with our best dresses,

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:51.040
just watching what dress she has on,
then we come out of the church,

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:54.160
directly we ask the question,
Where did you get this one?, you see.

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:59.040
So, the whole attention
is on a social contact,

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:01.920
a social mass feeling within ourselves.

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:04.720
So, we are not individuals
at all at that time, not at all.

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:12.400
First, we have to be absolute individuals,
and then you become a complete,

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:15.400
aware part of the whole.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:19.920
But, if you are not an individual,
say that’s why people who belong to these sects,

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:25.200
or belong to some sort of a commitment,
or to an organized place,

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:33.840
they find it difficult, because they are not
yet prepared to accept that individual jump

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:36.400
into the whole.

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:38.640
If the whole of it comes, well and good.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:41.400
If the whole doesn’t come,
they are sticking on to it,

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:46.000
though it can be very superficial also,
like, you see, in England is a custom

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.120
to put the fork and spoon
in a particular way.

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:53.200
In France it is different,
in somewhere it is different.

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.160
Now, even that can be
a club-forming stuff for us,

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.800
because, you see, we are Americans
we’ll put it this way,

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:02.240
we are English we’ll put it this way,
if we are French, we’ll put it this way.

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.800
But it is such a superficial
sort of a thing

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:07.680
and if you go into it
it’s all superficial.

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:10.480
All our clubbing is superficial.

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:14.560
Now, if you start getting after it
and reacting against it,

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:17.520
then you are destroying yourself.
You are completely destroyed.

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:20.080
There is no need to destroy
anything like that,

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:23.920
but to be understanding
that this is superficial.

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:28.160
Nothing, you should not waste your energy
in fighting anyone of these.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:31.440
There is no need to fight anything,
to get out of it.

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.920
There’s no need to fight any such thing.

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:37.600
What happens, that by fighting
you lose your energy for nothing at all.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:43.280
On the contrary, you should understand
that all these things are artificial,

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:46.560
and you should wait for a moment
when you get the reality.

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:49.200
But if you fight them also
there’s a problem.

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:52.320
If you don’t fight them and you become one,
there’s a problem.

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:55.360
So, both things are energy-sapping.

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:58.960
We go on thinking, thinking,
thinking about it, where do we reach?

00:20:58.960 --> 00:20:59.460
We reach nowhere.

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:07.840
So, Sahaja Yoga is a system
which is the system of the nature.

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:12.800
Is not a system of human beings,
which is artificial, or an organization,

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:15.440
or a mass movement,
nothing of the kind!

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:20.560
Is the system of the nature itself,
which has made you a human being,

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:24.960
an individual, now, like an egg.

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:32.160
Now this individual has to become,
not the mass, which is an animal instinct,

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:38.480
but to become collectively conscious,
has to become.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:43.600
Is a consciousness, means
on the central nervous system

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:49.600
you feel that consciousness,
and that is what is the reality.

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:58.880
We go about into anything understanding
that this is right, that is right, is all mental.

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:04.640
If you understand everything
whatever is mentally available,

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:07.360
you are still in the shell.

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:12.960
But what you feel is the point.

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:19.840
What you feel on your central nervous system
is your real consciousness.

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:23.040
The rest of it is your mental activities,
imagination,

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:27.520
or whatever is mental is manmade,
it has no meaning.

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:29.280
Like we have written books after books,

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:33.760
I don’t know how many energies have been
wasted in doing all sorts of things.

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:40.400
Books after books are written about this,
that, all kinds of yarns and yarns of,

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:44.400
I should say,
imaginary wanderings about things.

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:47.600
But that’s not the thing, you see,
it’s within yourself.

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:51.520
That’s within yourself,
is your own Spirit,

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:56.640
that resides there in your heart,
is your own power, which you should get.

00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:00.720
And if you can feel that power
then you will be amazed

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:04.880
that you don’t have to have
any United Nations Organization and all that.

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:10.640
You really enter into the Kingdom of God
in the sense that you get that power of love,

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:20.560
which makes you extremely loving, sweet,
I should say magnetic, extremely gentle,

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:24.880
and also could be very powerful
if it comes to use of power.

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:26.720
It’s extremely powerful.

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:31.360
In your behaviour you become
an extremely attractive person

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:35.760
in the sense that
you do not give trouble to others.

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:39.280
You do not – on the contrary,
you are a trouble-shooter, I should say,

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.280
you are a person who is a peacemaker.

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:44.640
Wherever you stand
you create peace and happiness,

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:47.040
but this is still outward.

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:52.800
Inside, you are so tranquil and blissful,
and the highest above is that

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:58.560
you are so connected that, even verbally,
if you ask any question, Is there God?

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:01.200
you start getting great vibrations.

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:04.560
The rapport is established;
you can see the rapport is now established;

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:07.680
you can talk to God.

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:11.520
It’s easy to say that there is no God;
it’s very good,

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:13.600
because then we have no headaches,
people think,

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:17.120
but all the headaches come
because of this kind of a belief also,

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:18.480
that there is no God.

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:21.440
And also, there will be headaches
if you believe that there is God

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:23.120
without knowing it.

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:29.760
Both things, according to Me,
are still the two sides of a pendulum.

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:33.520
It is not in the centre,
or we can say this is how we go

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:36.640
to the right and to the left,
but do not ascend.

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:42.560
For the ascent, this actual thing,
this living thing, this germination,

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:45.840
has to take place,
and that is why Sahaja Yoga

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:49.760
transcends all these
nonsensical sects, absolutely.

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:54.800
It has no respect for them,
it has no respect,

00:24:54.800 --> 00:25:00.240
because it saps the energy
of human beings, it puts them down,

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:06.400
it doesn’t give them a chance to rise
to their own power which is within themselves.

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:11.680
But, with understanding that, after all,
human beings are ignorant about it,

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:15.360
they are not very sure,
it’s alright if they’re involved

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:19.280
with any other such things,
doesn’t matter.

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:20.960
But, in a sect, if you go –
I was surprised,

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:27.120
I went to a Unity Church
a Unity Church, imagine, Unity Church, in Houston.

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:32.400
They were kind enough to invite me there
and they didn’t know how outspoken I was

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:35.440
about things, you see,
poor things were in for trouble I think,

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:36.560
after My coming.

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:41.600
But whatever it is, I was surprised;
they were selling all kinds of books there,

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:46.000
all kinds, which are satanic,
which are mass movements,

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.520
which are very detrimental
to human beings, and they knew they were.

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:56.320
Like, in a church they were selling books
of a man who is treating licentiousness,

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:59.840
permissiveness, can you imagine?
Such a contradictory thing,

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:02.960
I mean either Christ was wrong
or this man was wrong,

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.240
how can you have both the things together?

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:09.840
And they were saying This is Unity.
This is not unity; this is not unity.

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:15.040
This is such a superficial unity
of getting all the dust, filth everything together

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:18.560
and gold with it,
and saying Now you have it.

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:21.600
Do you put in your food the poison
and then eat it,

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:24.160
because you want to unite it?

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:27.600
You can only unite things
which can be united.

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:30.080
You cannot unite all the mess
of the world together

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:32.400
and say this is unity.

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:36.320
You cannot unite Christ with a man
who is teaching licentiousness,

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:40.800
permissiveness
and all kinds of dirty tricks.

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:44.480
So, one has to understand
the mind plays a very big trick,

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:47.600
that the mind itself is a very,
very tricky thing,

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:50.640
it’s a very intelligent thing,
and it beats you.

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:53.760
And you start understanding,
Oh, let it be, doesn’t matter

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:56.000
and you start compromising.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.872
How can there be compromise
between the food and the poison?

00:26:58.872 --> 00:27:01.520
Can you have strychnine with food?
Simple thing as that.

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:07.280
We have to separate, we have to say,
This wrong, this is right.

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:11.920
Whether people like it or not,
if we have to respect human life,

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:15.760
if you have to respect
this great creation of God,

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:19.680
if you have to see that they get
what that is promised to them,

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:23.600
are we going to play with their lives,
with their body, with everything?

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:27.040
Like there are some people who believe
that drugs can take you to God.

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:30.320
I mean, just imagine the absurdity of it.

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:41.520
Now, thank God people know that drugs
harm your attention, harm your awareness.

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:45.040
There was a book written, I was told,
I met somebody in Vancouver,

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:53.280
who has got a PhD,
by a book which was written by –

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:55.600
I’ve forgotten the name of the gentleman –

00:27:55.600 --> 00:28:01.270
who has described that the alcohol
takes you to spiritual life.

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:03.280
And I say absurd.

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:06.960
The thing that goes against
your awareness itself,

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:10.560
how can it take you to awareness
which is enlightened?

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:15.600
It would be something like
to cover this light,

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:20.480
break all the bulbs, everything,
and that will take you to light.

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:25.600
It is absolutely absurd.
The whole statement is absurd.

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:32.320
You cannot go to God if you try
to harm your body, harm your mind,

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:33.120
harm yourself.

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:38.720
Even a person who has had a bad childhood,
who has suffered because of something,

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:46.880
say war, or something,
even such a person is a little less blessed

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:50.800
in the beginning;
we have to work on him to put his mind at rest,

00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:56.000
put his body at rest, to see
that there is equilibrium within him,

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.400
and then only he can get realization.

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:02.800
Anybody who is a disturbed man,
who is upset, we have to put it right.

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:07.040
Now, some people have definitely felt
that drugs are going to solve the problem,

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:10.160
honestly they have felt it;
I know they have been very honest about it.

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:11.920
They have taken drugs; doesn’t matter.

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:14.640
That also can be neutralized,
because you are seekers;

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:17.440
you have just done that
because you are seeking.

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:21.440
Is that – the main thing is that
you must see and that you must get it,

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:24.720
is the main object of Sahaja Yoga,
that is yours.

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:29.120
So, whatever may come,
whatever may have happened, doesn’t matter.

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:32.160
It’s going to be corrected,
it’s going to work out.

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:39.280
And then, overnight, people give up
because they realize that this is it.

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:44.960
All problems of humanity are
because we have not yet found out our Spirit,

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:48.320
which is a collective being.

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:52.240
All international problems, say,
all your political problems,

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:56.000
all your economic problems,
come from that one thing

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.680
which has not happened to human beings;
you are still in transition.

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:04.240
I would say it would be something like
people who are still in the water,

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:08.000
getting halfway up and halfway down.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.240
They don’t know whether
we are to be saved or not.

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:14.320
But once you have reached the shores
that’s all right.

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:16.800
That’s a little breakthrough
that has to take place

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:20.640
and people have to establish
their collective consciousness.

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:23.200
So, there are many who get realization,
you see, many come here,

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:26.640
they get their realization,
then disappear. I have seen.

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:28.800
They feel very happy,
everything done, now!

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:32.560
Nothing; you have to become
collectively conscious after that.

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:42.000
Means you have to educate yourself
to understand how to feel

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.920
that collectivity within yourself.

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:48.000
That is more important,
more difficult for human beings,

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:55.040
because they all like –
what do you say? – a quick happening,

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:56.800
a very quick happening.

00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:59.600
And a quick happening takes place,
no doubt,

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:04.880
but that quick happening is just taking you
to a point where you have to stay,

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:06.640
you have to become.

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:14.240
If becoming is the thing,
like an egg breaks into a nice little bird,

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:17.920
but the bird must learn to fly.

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:24.960
If it does not educate itself to fly,
it remains something in between egg and bird,

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:26.640
and anybody can eat that off.

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:31.040
It has no quality as a bird
which can save itself, protect itself,

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:32.880
and can fly and enjoy.

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:41.760
It has no quality of a bird
if it is just roaming about like cock and hens,

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:44.240
you see, when they were in the forest,
they used to fly,

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:48.000
I have seen these forest ones
flying very high.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.200
They can fly just like an eagle,
but if you see them on the ground,

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:54.720
if they are settled down on the ground,

00:31:54.720 --> 00:32:00.000
they are eaten up by people
who can catch them – anybody can catch them.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.400
So, to have that quality,
the quality of that collective being,

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:09.520
one has to educate and rise above
that shell system,

00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:13.280
that system that has bound them,
that has made them an individual,

00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:17.600
which was important, to have a shell for you.
The individuality was very, very important,

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:19.680
otherwise you would not have been matured.

00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:24.320
So that, a time comes that shell
must be broken.

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:29.280
Like now, the car is important for me
to bring down here,

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:31.520
but I have to leave the car
to come down inside.

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:34.480
In the same way you have reached
a certain stage that,

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:39.440
up to that point it was alright,
but you don’t have to carry it on any further,

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:43.520
and you have to settle down
with the new dimension,

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:50.880
a new life within you, and that’s what is
your second birth.

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:57.166
For this, God has placed everything
within ourselves, you see there a system –

00:32:57.166 --> 00:32:58.000
did anybody speak about Kundalini?
You should have.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:58.880
All right, doesn’t matter.

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:02.000
Now, you see, every time I don’t want
to repeat about Kundalini and all that.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:11.120
And there is a system within us
called the Kundalini. All is within us.

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:17.920
Now, it is very easy to sit down and say,
Now, Mother, how do you say it is so?

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:22.080
I mean, it’s good, you see, because
people want to know about it,

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:29.280
how is it we have the Kundalini
in the triangular bone?

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:33.280
And then we say that there are subtle centers
which look after,

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:36.880
I mean which manifest outside
our gross centers, and all these things.

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:43.120
We do talk about it, but you can all doubt,
Let’s see, how can there be such a thing?

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:46.480
How are we to believe You? But why not?

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:50.000
Because I’m not taking
any money from you, nothing.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.280
By believing Me, what is your loss?
It’s nothing.

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:56.080
Now the people who are here,
you should see, and ask them.

00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:58.880
Their lives are all changed.
They have become different people.

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:01.200
They’re enjoying themselves,
they’ve got their own powers,

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:03.280
they can manifest them,
they have become experts.

00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:06.480
They look so simple, just like you,
but if you see their faces

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:09.840
you will see how blooming they are.

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:14.640
Apart from that, that they know all about it,
they are masters and scholars,

00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:17.280
and they are great gurus,
sitting down here around you,

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:19.360
and you can also become that.

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:21.200
So, there’s nothing to doubt.

00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:25.600
But now, supposing you are
a doubting Thomas, you see, you will doubt.

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:29.436
I don’t mind if you doubt, also.
We’ll try to solve the doubt.

00:34:29.436 --> 00:34:33.360
The main thing is
of making you the Spirit.

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:38.000
That’s our job. For that we are here
and you are also for that,

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.240
so it is better to cooperate with us
than to argue and discuss

00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:44.800
and spoil everybody’s attention.

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:47.280
You see, some people are
such reactionaries, they come,

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:51.040
ask questions, and when it comes
to realization they just run away.

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:52.800
Mostly we have seen such people,

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:56.240
who sit down with a very doubting mind
all the time,

00:34:56.240 --> 00:35:01.120
but for what are you doubting?
What are you going to lose?

00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:03.600
What are you going to lose here? Nothing.

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:05.600
If you have a cancer you can be cured.

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:08.240
If you have mental problems
they can be cured,

00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:10.720
all the problems can be cured
as a blessing of God.

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:15.440
It’s true, and, apart from that,
you become your own power.

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:16.218
But if it is a mass system
you don’t doubt.

00:35:16.218 --> 00:35:16.299
You see so, for example, we go to church,
we don’t doubt, just we don’t doubt.

00:35:16.299 --> 00:35:25.280
We don’t doubt the priest,
we don’t doubt anybody.

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:29.840
We go to a temple, we never doubt the priest,
we just pay as everybody’s paying –

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:31.040
it’s a mass system.

00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:35.520
It is not – here you are an individual,
and that’s why you doubt.

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:38.800
You are an individual now and you doubt,

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:42.640
but I would suggest that better
to have your realization

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:44.880
than to waste your energy in doubting.

00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:47.600
Because if you are all seekers,
you are going to get your realization,

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:49.120
if not today, tomorrow.

00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:52.560
But only thing, why delay?
Sooner the better.

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:55.280
But if you have any questions,
I would like to answer them.

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:59.828
We have all this Kundalini and all that
and I wish Gavin had told you about it

00:35:59.828 --> 00:36:00.960
or somebody should have told you.

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:05.840
Next time we’ll have a lecture
about Kundalini, what it is,

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:10.720
how it gives realization, how it rises,
how it pierces through different chakras,

00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:13.760
pierces through your fontanel bone area,

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:25.065
and also how it gives you
of these Chaitanya Lahiris,

00:36:25.065 --> 00:36:25.108
what we call as the Cool Breeze
in the hand:

00:36:25.108 --> 00:36:28.560
cool breeze of the Holy Ghost,
and that’s what you have to see.

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:32.240
Now, if you have any questions, you may ask,
because when you are getting realization,

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:35.600
I want you to be free, because you have
to go beyond thought,

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:38.080
and it just happens
without any difficulty,

00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:39.280
there’s nothing to worry.

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:42.880
Now there are people who say that
Kundalini’s very dangerous and all that.

00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:45.360
Maybe for people who do not know
anything about it –

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:48.080
like if you put your hand inside this,
you’ll get a shock,

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:53.027
because they don’t what this means,
you see, but the one who knows the job

00:36:53.027 --> 00:36:56.523
knows it – it’s very simple.
Even children can do it if they know it.

00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:58.622
If you have any questions, please ask me.

00:37:10.342 --> 00:37:13.051
Please ask, if you have any questions.

00:37:27.429 --> 00:37:31.200
You should ask me some questions.

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:35.680
How many of you have listened
to the radio and have come?

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:40.400
Any one of you? Is good, good.
Yes, it’s good.

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:45.520
So, you thought it was very convincing?
What he said it? Is it?

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:50.080
Good. I’m happy. That’s John.

00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:50.720
(laughs)

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:53.511
He’s doing Theology,
and he’s now fed up.

00:37:53.511 --> 00:37:56.560
He says, Mother, theology is just
talk, talk, talk, talk, talk

00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:59.280
and but he should have said
one more point, as I said.

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:04.720
John and Fergy, is he here?
Fergy, he’s there.

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:10.480
Both of them had gone, but he didn’t say
that you get your own power.

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:14.320
You see, in a cult you do not get your power,
you’re just like mad, all of you,

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:20.160
walking into some sort of a blind alley,
but you don’t know where you are leading to.

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:24.747
You must know what you are doing,
what it is, everything about it.

00:38:24.747 --> 00:38:30.400
Good, I’m happy that you were
so convinced by his, this thing,

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:37.200
but we found it impossible to handle
these people of the media.

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:40.160
Very funny upset people, I tell you.

00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:43.840
They don’t want to – they abhor truth,
I really tell you, they abhor truth.

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:48.560
Most surprising is that when you
tell them the truth they are really upset.

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:49.913
They don’t want to hear, you see.

00:38:49.913 --> 00:38:52.200
If you tell them some hanky-panky stories
they are very happy

00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:55.520
and they would like to help you
if there’s a hanky-panky story behind it,

00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:58.400
but if you say,
Oh, you can get your realization,

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:01.760
you are the truth, you are the Spirit,
they don’t want to listen to you.

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:05.840
They’re very funny people, you know.
They can’t believe it can be fine –

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:08.320
why shouldn’t we have
confidence in ourselves?

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:11.280
After all, are we going to seek it
again next year and next year?

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:19.920
Why postpone it?
If it is so, why not have it?

00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:23.520
This is the first time the radio people
have allowed somebody to speak,

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:26.157
while Sahaja Yoga has been
growing very slowly.

00:39:26.157 --> 00:39:30.720
If the media help us, you see,
understanding how important it is and vital,

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:35.025
that it should grow in these countries,
because in India it’s much easier,

00:39:35.025 --> 00:39:38.480
much easier, I mean thousands and thousands
it’s working out in the villages and all.

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:41.360
But here, you see,
media’s so important and so powerful.

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:45.480
Thank God we are not so developed,
so we don’t depend on media so much in India

00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:45.760
(laughs)

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:51.120
and the newspaper people also understand
that truth has to be there,

00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:54.880
and they help us,
they have been very helpful in India,

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:56.000
compared to here.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.880
Here nobody wants to even publish
an article on Sahaja Yoga – nothing.

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:11.680
Can you imagine?
Nobody wants to do anything about it.

00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:26.080
Question – Do all the Sahaja Yogis
use your photograph when they meditate?

00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:29.280
Yes, now, I don’t know who told you that.

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:33.440
I’d say it should not be told, because you see,
people get frightened with the idea

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:36.800
that why use My photograph, you see
is the problem, it’s this way.

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:43.120
Now, see, the trouble is
My photograph has got vibrations.

00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:47.200
Now, what to do?
The problem is like this.

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:51.200
It has tremendous vibrations, not only,
but it can cure people.

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:58.400
There was a boy in America
who was down with blood cancer,

00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:07.174
and the parents of the boy came to see me
in a very far-fetched village,

00:41:07.174 --> 00:41:11.360
and they wanted that
the boy should be cured.

00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:15.520
So, I said, All right, give me
his photograph, I’ll work on it.

00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:21.520
But in any case, I sent them,
asked them to telephone

00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:26.080
one of the Sahaja Yogis in New York.
She has only My photograph,

00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:28.800
and she used it and the boy is cured.

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:31.200
Now, supposing if it is so,
say it’s a penicillin injection,

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:36.960
or you can call it something, you see,
a miracle drug, for example,

00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:39.680
say My photograph is,
then should we not use it?

00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:43.280
Now, supposing it is,
that’s what it is.

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:44.640
What can I do about it?

00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:48.880
I didn’t know the camera
would be so good, really, I didn’t know.

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:53.600
Camera is much more sensitive
than human beings are, I must tell you.

00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:56.320
There are so many things
that camera has caught up,

00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:58.400
which human beings cannot catch.

00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:04.160
Like, one day I was sitting in a village
giving lecture in a place

00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:11.247
where a realized soul had died –
a great realized soul.

00:42:11.247 --> 00:42:14.880
And the camera caught – I mean I can feel it,
but you people do not see it with your eyes –

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:19.280
a great flood of light
was falling on My head – a flood of light,

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:21.520
and the camera caught it,
and six times it happened

00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:26.692
and the camera caught it six times,
and seventh time I just did like this

00:42:26.692 --> 00:42:27.280
and it stopped. Just there, in the camera.

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:28.880
I don’t know if they have
brought the photograph,

00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:31.120
but we have that photograph with us
and you can see for yourself, you see.

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:39.600
Camera is so sensitive
and so honest and so deep

00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:43.760
that the way things have been shown
by a camera.

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:49.880
The other day somebody took
photograph of My feet in India,

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:57.120
with that instant camera,
and both My feet, you see,

00:42:57.120 --> 00:43:00.320
I was telling them that these two centers
are working very much,

00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:04.080
and they are on the Feet, you see,
and from My toe you could see

00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:09.200
a shaft of light coming out
from one of the toes and one of the fingers,

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:12.946
which I had said these centers are catching.
So, camera caught it.

00:43:12.946 --> 00:43:15.760
There must be something about me also,
isn’t it? Must be, of course.

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:19.920
It’s there, but is better to see
and I always tell Sahaja Yogis

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:22.400
not to tell about the photograph,
just now to anyone,

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:24.640
because if you tell them they get upset.

00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:30.524
You see, they think Oh, God,
is She going to dominate me?

00:43:30.524 --> 00:43:30.550
(laughs, general laughter)

00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:32.640
You know, we are so frightened
of domination, isn’t it,

00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:34.716
because people have been very dominating.

00:43:34.716 --> 00:43:38.560
But could be somebody loves you very much,
that even the photograph of hers

00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:41.840
can love you so much, isn’t it?
Could be.

00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:45.440
Something we cannot think of –
someone who is just love.

00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:47.840
And the photograph has that
love within itself.

00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:57.280
You can use it as you like.
Then there should be no objection.

00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:00.560
None of the people before me
were photographed.

00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:05.200
Christ was never photographed,
Buddha was not photographed,

00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:07.520
even Mahommed was not photographed.

00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:11.680
This is the first time you have developed
this wonderful thing called camera,

00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:15.600
and there’s my photograph.
What to do?

00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:23.120
In Hong Kong, the lady who was in charge –
I mean, Chinese have very wise people –

00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:30.640
and this lady, who was in charge
of that TV center,

00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:32.160
she felt the vibrations and all that,

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:34.880
and she said Mother, why not we use You
on the TV?

00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:38.080
I said, Good idea,
and she put me there, on the TV

00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:39.960
for about three minutes, just standing,
and she said.

00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:42.236
Just put your hands
towards the photograph and see,

00:44:42.236 --> 00:44:44.800
and so many got cool breeze
and they wrote to us saying that,

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:47.600
We got cool breeze in our hands
from Mother.

00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:53.040
And we have established a center
in Hong Kong, only by these things.

00:44:53.040 --> 00:45:00.386
If your TV people ever allow Me to do that,
I could help, in a very great way, isn’t it?

00:45:00.386 --> 00:45:01.840
And would you not like to do it?

00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:04.960
I mean, supposing you were in My place,
it would have been better, I know,

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:06.320
but you cannot be.

00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:11.920
Anybody in My place can come and do it,
I’ll be very happy.

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:16.160
But that’s the trouble, you see,
Christ has to bear the Cross,

00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:19.360
He had to do it, nobody could do it.

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:26.640
We don’t mind Him doing that,
but why should we mind Him being the Christ?

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:35.120
Somebody has to do it. Alright?

00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:39.440
And you will do it, too.
Even you can give realization to people.

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:41.680
You can give realization –
all of them can give realization,

00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:44.160
they can cure,
they are all experts sitting here,

00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:46.000
one better than the other.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.640
When you talk to them, you’ll be amazed;
they’re all scholars!

00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:52.392
Somebody sitting next to you is quite good!

00:45:52.392 --> 00:45:58.400
(laughs)
Both the sides, I should say!

00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:02.320
It is rather difficult
to accept a photograph,

00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:05.760
because it is said that you should not
bow to any.

00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:10.720
It was said because there were
no photographs before, nothing was there.

00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:13.040
Photograph is such a truthful thing.

00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:17.120
And you will see yourself, later on,
then you won’t give up, I know that,

00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:24.800
you’ll like it. Alright?

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:37.983
Any other question?

00:46:37.983 --> 00:46:40.280
A photograph – we also have
symbolic value for photographs,

00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:43.480
say, for example,
we have the Queen’s photograph here.

00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:47.200
We’ll not spit on her photograph, will we?
She’s not there.

00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:49.595
Will you spit on her photograph,
any one of you?

00:46:49.595 --> 00:46:53.360
Will not, because after all that photo,
that thing represents something,

00:46:53.360 --> 00:47:02.374
is a symbol, isn’t it?

00:47:02.374 --> 00:47:07.840
It may not give vibrations
but definitely it is a symbol of something.

00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:16.960
It is a coefficience of the whole thing
that works out this.

00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:20.560
Even when I am talking to you,
you’ll be amazed,

00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:26.640
something is working out within yourself.
The sound also carries the vibrations.

00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:30.160
You cannot see, but so many Sahaja Yogis
have seen the vibrations going into it.

00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:33.200
You start seeing all these things.

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:37.440
So, you have to develop up to that point,
before that we don’t tell you anything

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:44.640
about how to become collectively conscious
in a permanent way.

00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:48.960
In the beginning we just say,
All right, you let us give you the light.

00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:57.200
First you feel the light,
then you start seeing everything.

00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:59.440
Nothing is compulsory in Sahaja Yoga,

00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:08.720
but you yourselves start doing things
because you know it is so.

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:18.640
Should we have realization? All right.

00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:21.280
Those who are new people
should come forward.

00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:26.560
I would request – is better if all are
on the second (row),

00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:30.080
all those who are realized should get up
and these, if you look at these people,

00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:33.920
they look just like you, isn’t it?
But they are all realized souls.

00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:38.800
They’re all realized souls, and experts.
This one is another expert.

00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:46.204
He used to sell wine before.

00:48:46.204 --> 00:48:48.560
(laughs, general laughter)
Yes, yes! It’s true, yes.

00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:58.080
They are all around you,
in front of you, behind you.

00:48:58.080 --> 00:49:04.617
Can you come forward, please?
Please. It’s better. Please,

00:49:04.617 --> 00:49:19.440
there are seats there. Here are some seats
if some people want to come down.

00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:23.200
It’s better to be in the front seat,
because later on, you see,

00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:25.440
if there is a problem
with your Kundalini rising –

00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:29.600
why don’t you come here, my child?
Come along, you, both of you, come along.

00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:32.720
If there’s any problem,
then the Sahaja Yogis can look after it;

00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:34.880
they can raise the Kundalini
with their own hands,

00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:37.920
because the power is flowing
from their hands, you see;

00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:41.760
so they can raise the Kundalini
and can give you realization,

00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:46.557
and then, once you have got realization,
you can give realizations to others.

00:49:46.557 --> 00:49:47.840
Is as simple as that.

00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:51.280
Today they are realized souls,
tomorrow you will be realized soul.

00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:53.520
All of you have to become realized souls.

00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:59.680
How many will become, God alone knows,
but there should be many, even in the West,

00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:03.760
where things are moving rather slowly
compared to India.

00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:11.200
But it will, it will happen I’m sure.

00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:16.160
Now, for getting realization,
it’s a very simple method.

00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:19.600
Is that you have to expose yourself,
your fingers.

00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:25.760
You see, these fingertips are the ends
of all the sympathetic nervous system,

00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:31.760
and these two hands
represent those seven centers,

00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:36.000
like one, two, three, four, five, six
and seven.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.400
Seven centers,
as you see in the hands there;

00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:42.560
exactly like that.
You can even tally it later on, you can see.

00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:46.880
For example, if you have a liver trouble
you can feel them on your fingers.

00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:50.880
Everything you can feel on your fingertips,
they said On my fingertips,

00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:52.400
that’s how you become an expert.

00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:55.280
English language has many
unconscious expressions,

00:50:55.280 --> 00:51:00.720
which has shown that,
how you become realized.

00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:04.640
Now, so, what happens,
that you just have to close your eyes.

00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:07.996
First of all, you must close your eyes,
because, when Kundalini rises

00:51:07.996 --> 00:51:12.400
and pierces through this center of Christ,
then there’s dilatation of the pupil,

00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:16.880
so we want your eyes to be closed
at that time so the Kundalini rises smoothly,

00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:19.600
and then She pierces out from here.

00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:23.040
When She pierces out from here,
you can feel the cool breeze

00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:28.000
coming out of your head, you can feel it,
but you have to have little,

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.840
melting of the sensitivity, you see.

00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:32.240
Some people are not so sensitive
and they do not feel it.

00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:36.000
Doesn’t matter. If you don’t feel it today,
you’ll feel it tomorrow.

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:40.160
But most of them feel it,
and these people, are the Sahaja Yogis,

00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:40.880
will look after you.

00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:45.360
So, we have to be wise,
we have to be sensible about it,

00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:47.120
and it will work out.

00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:51.040
It will work out with all of you,
it has to work out, you are seekers,

00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:54.720
this is your right to have it,
and you are having it because it is your right.

00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:58.880
I am just here like –
I tell all these people that I am like a bank,

00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:01.040
which is cashing your checks.

00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:05.200
You have done good work in your last lives,
and these lives, and you are not wrongdoers;

00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:06.480
you are good people.

00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:10.400
You are seekers, and you are seekers of God,
of ancient times.

00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:13.520
You’ve come here to take your realization;
you’d better get it.

00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:18.320
It’s as simple as that.
My job is to give you realization.

00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:22.080
I’m paid for it; you can think like that,
and that is what it is,

00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:23.520
and you have to have it.

00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:28.160
There is no quarrel between you and Me.
If you don’t want to have it, it’s all right.

00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:32.640
But it is with Me all the time, safe;
whenever you want, you can have it.

00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:35.200
But better to have it as soon as possible.

00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:41.360
Now, put your hands towards Me like this,
and just close your eyes.

00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:59.991
Just close your eyes and you’ll be amazed
the difference it will create.

00:52:59.991 --> 00:53:02.560
Just put both the hands towards Me.
I mean, it is a simple method.

00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:06.557
Why you are putting it because
these centers must be exposed.

00:53:06.557 --> 00:53:12.960
Is important. Very simple;
it is very simple method.

00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:17.320
Please close your eyes.
Please close your eyes, just close your eyes.

00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:40.560
Now, there are problems within ourselves.
They show up in our Kundalini rising.

00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:44.800
Not to you, but to the people
who are sitting here who are realized souls,

00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:48.160
and when you are realized souls
you will also feel the same.

00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:54.080
At this time the problem is on the heart,
there’s too much pressure on the heart.

00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:57.760
I would request all of you not to open your eyes,
not to open your eyes,

00:53:57.760 --> 00:54:02.560
but put your right hand on your heart,
inside your coat, jackets;

00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:05.360
just on the heart,
especial on your heart,

00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:08.480
and in the heart resides the Spirit.

00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:12.160
Just put your left hand,
and you can ask the question,

00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:15.280
a very fundamental question
within your heart,

00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:17.680
you can ask Me a question
within your heart,

00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:19.920
Mother, am I the Spirit?

00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:22.640
Just to ask that question,
because you are the Spirit;

00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:39.440
but just ask that question. Ask thrice.

00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:45.760
Now, while talking to you about Sahaja Yoga
I might have said something that might&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:46.960
have upset you,

00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:50.400
or you might be thinking that
I have done this wrong and that wrong,

00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:54.320
but forget the past.

00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:57.920
In Sahaja Yoga there’s nothing like sin
when you come for your realization;

00:54:57.920 --> 00:55:00.640
it’s all washed off,
so don’t worry about that,

00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:01.680
and don’t feel guilty.

00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:04.000
If you feel guilty,
of course there’s a problem,

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:08.480
but you just say, within yourself,
in your heart, that Mother, I am not guilty.

00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:14.400
You are not guilty at all anymore now.

00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:21.680
Anything you have done, anything that you
think is very wrong, forget it for the time being.

00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:28.400
Just forget it, and say, thrice,
Mother, I am not guilty.

00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:40.720
Now the third thing you have to ask
is to say,

00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:48.800
Mother, am I my own master,
am I my own guru?

00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:56.400
Also, ask this question three times.

00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:14.280
Please put both the feet on the ground,
in a straight way,

00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:26.000
you see the Mother Earth helps us by that.

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:54.160
Now, you may ask a question again, saying,
Mother, am I the part and parcel of the whole?

00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:57.200
Please don’t feel guilty,
please don’t feel guilty,

00:56:57.200 --> 00:57:03.200
please don’t feel guilty.

00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:12.560
It’s a fashion, I tell you, feeling guilty;
is a competition, who feels more guilty.

00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:18.560
People like to have some sort of
Greek tragedies artificially built

00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:22.720
around their lives.

00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:44.960
(chuckles)

00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:10.720
Please ask the question
Am I the part and parcel of the whole?

00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:15.440
Just ask the question, please,
because collectivity comes to people

00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:36.560
who are large-hearted, who are big-hearted,
big people, who are not small.

00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:49.520
Now, please put both the hands towards Me.
Both the hands,

00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:55.720
and just say Mother, I have forgiven
all the people.

00:59:56.400 --> 00:59:59.760
I’ve forgiven everyone.

00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:03.200
Please put both the hands towards Me,
and just forgive everyone,

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:05.040
forgive everyone.

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:08.400
Say I have forgiven everyone, Mother,
I have forgiven everyone.

01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:22.000
Forgive!

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:28.880
Now, you have to say this because
I cannot go against your freedom,

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:32.480
you are free to choose,
so you have to say

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:35.120
Mother, may I have my realization?

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:40.320
Will You please give me realization?
because I cannot force it upon you,

01:00:40.320 --> 01:01:04.640
you have to ask for it. It’s your freedom.
Just ask for it.
