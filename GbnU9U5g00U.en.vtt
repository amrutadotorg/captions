00:00.400 --> 00:02.892
1985_04_20 The testing power of Mahamaya

00:03.279 --> 00:10.503
There should be spiritual ascent.
Otherwise you cannot understand.

00:10.584 --> 00:15.476
If you are living with your ego and
superegos, you cannot understand.

00:15.673 --> 00:18.963
As it is this is Mahamaya, no one
can understand Her.

00:19.076 --> 00:23.291
Even Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha
could not understand, it’s so tremendous.

00:23.372 --> 00:26.731
It has played tricks on Them also.

00:29.065 --> 00:32.121
But at least you’ll enjoy the play.

00:32.528 --> 00:35.187
You’ll be a vehicle.

00:35.268 --> 00:37.884
You ’ll be an instrument of that great power

00:37.965 --> 00:42.857
and you yourself will see how you
play Mahamaya tricks on others.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.296
This is again a promise of Mahamaya, so be careful.

00:50.779 --> 00:56.979
It’s already been said, you have already
noticed, you have already seen it,

00:57.686 --> 01:04.036
it will not reveal to you everything, because
you cannot bear it, the revelation.

01:04.500 --> 01:09.081
But slowly you will see it.

01:09.161 --> 01:12.234
But you must have power to bear it.

01:12.666 --> 01:20.558
If you have that power, then there cannot
be anything in between you and me.

01:20.820 --> 01:24.588
We all can become one with that.

01:26.379 --> 01:30.893
This Mahamaya power is the one
which has given you Realisation,

01:31.226 --> 01:35.712
is the one which is guiding you,
which is helping you.

01:36.425 --> 01:41.142
So many of you are still keeping to one deity.

01:41.230 --> 01:44.374
Like some people who were worshipping
Shiva, are still with Shiva,

01:44.455 --> 01:46.619
some with Vishnu, some with Christ.

01:46.699 --> 01:50.347
They’re all with me, all integrated.

01:51.639 --> 01:55.483
They still go back to the same, I have seen.

01:55.564 --> 02:00.505
That’s a dangerous thing because
they won’t stand with you in that.

02:03.130 --> 02:05.207
Still the attachments are there.

02:05.288 --> 02:09.973
There are also very subtler attachments.
Get out of it!

02:12.252 --> 02:16.720
You should have only one attachment and
that is to Mahamaya, and nothing else.

02:16.934 --> 02:21.336
And that’s how it is going to work out further.

02:23.005 --> 02:28.490
It’s not difficult for you to understand
because you have sharp intelligence.

02:28.959 --> 02:32.851
But it doesn’t go in the heart, more in the brain,

02:33.019 --> 02:36.138
while those who have lesser intelligence
have a larger heart,

02:36.219 --> 02:39.815
it goes into their brain very easily.

02:41.739 --> 02:44.077
Supposing I go to India.

02:46.985 --> 02:48.752
You know all the villagers of India.

02:48.833 --> 02:52.131
What will give them the greatest pleasure?

02:52.211 --> 02:54.464
If I ask for something?

02:55.752 --> 02:58.660
Supposing I tell a poor man:

02:59.413 --> 03:05.760
“Can I have half a gram of gold?”

03:09.485 --> 03:11.565
He will never question.

03:13.690 --> 03:16.249
He'll say, “There must be something,
She is Mahamaya,

03:16.330 --> 03:18.365
if She has said it there must be something.”

03:18.446 --> 03:22.085
He’ll beg, borrow, steal, do something
and get it for me.

03:22.166 --> 03:31.560
Because he sees the complete dimension
of that saying

03:31.641 --> 03:36.186
that “You have to get me this.”

03:39.453 --> 03:41.794
He sees it, he knows it,

03:41.875 --> 03:45.488
and he’ll work it out in every way possible.

03:48.305 --> 03:52.197
What is to be done? He’ll not think
he has to borrow, he has to do this.

03:52.472 --> 03:55.246
He’s not bothered about this.

03:59.078 --> 04:02.970
There’s story of Shivaji which
I must have told you before also,

04:03.118 --> 04:06.667
that his Guruji wanted to take his test.

04:06.747 --> 04:11.486
Because Mahamaya is a testing… testing power.

04:11.567 --> 04:14.933
And he said… to his disciples he said:

04:15.014 --> 04:20.360
“I’ve got a terrible boil on my foot
which is about to burst out,”

04:20.473 --> 04:23.693
a huge thing he had here, tied up.

04:23.827 --> 04:27.252
“And it’s leaking now
with the pus is coming out.

04:27.360 --> 04:32.252
And I cannot get it cured unless and until
one of you can suck it.” - Imagine!

04:32.841 --> 04:36.605
How many of you would agree?
Won’t even think of it, isn’t it?

04:37.125 --> 04:38.252
What a test!

04:38.360 --> 04:42.484
And especially Indians who are so worried
about their personal cleanliness.

04:42.565 --> 04:45.517
They wash their hands fifty times.

04:48.030 --> 04:50.522
So everybody looked at it, quite worried.

04:55.842 --> 05:03.734
Shivaji had come that time.
And Shivaji said: “Alright, I will do it.”

05:03.842 --> 05:07.680
And it was a mango he had put in there.

05:09.441 --> 05:13.827
And he sucked it and he said:
“It’s very nice and sweet…!”

05:22.195 --> 05:33.240
One day again he asked that:
“I want the milk of a tigress.”

05:34.294 --> 05:40.186
Everybody was quite frightened.
Who is going to milk the tigress?

05:40.568 --> 05:46.051
Shivaji said: “Alright, I’ll go!”
He went in the forest,

05:46.132 --> 05:53.340
and he was looking out for a tigress
who has given her cubs a - they,

05:53.421 --> 05:58.860
they are even worse.
And he saw some cubs there.

05:58.941 --> 06:01.157
So he went near them and he started saying:

06:01.238 --> 06:04.565
“See, my guru wants your mother’s milk.
Can I have it?

06:04.646 --> 06:07.120
I want to have your mother’s milk!”

06:07.386 --> 06:10.255
The tigress was looking at him.

06:10.842 --> 06:15.876
And he bowed to her. He said: “You see,
my guru wants your milk. What am I to do?”

06:15.957 --> 06:21.591
And she could see that.
She came and stood before him.

06:21.701 --> 06:26.440
He had taken a pot with him.
He milked her.

06:27.028 --> 06:32.761
And he took that for his guru
because even a tiger,

06:32.842 --> 06:38.900
even a serpent respects
the dedication to Reality.

06:39.842 --> 06:42.285
And that’s what is lacking.

06:42.365 --> 06:45.734
And once that is lacking,
you cannot be respected.

06:51.321 --> 06:54.517
And you have to respect yourself.

06:54.597 --> 07:00.240
Whether others respect you or not,
makes no difference at all whatsoever.

07:01.048 --> 07:06.720
But if you have respect for you, you won’t
bother about what others have to say.

07:09.842 --> 07:15.870
I can make out people who are intensely seeking,

07:15.951 --> 07:21.475
who are just seeking, who are just here
because of certain relations are here,

07:21.556 --> 07:23.653
or something like that.

07:25.647 --> 07:29.639
Now those who are intensely seeking will get
what they have asked me for,

07:29.719 --> 07:34.061
and that has everything in it, everything.

07:34.241 --> 07:39.440
And those who are casual will also
get casual results, that’s all.

07:41.842 --> 07:49.716
So the intensity will be fulfilled
with much greater intensity!

07:50.936 --> 07:54.790
No use looking at others; look at yourself.

07:54.871 --> 07:58.763
If you are losing your joy,
you are no more a Sahaja Yogi!

07:58.844 --> 08:02.736
You have to be in joy,
then only you are a Sahaj Yogi.
