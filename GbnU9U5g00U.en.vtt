00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.892
1985_04_20 The testing power of Mahamaya

00:00:03.279 --> 00:00:10.503
There should be spiritual ascent. 
Otherwise you cannot understand.

00:00:10.584 --> 00:00:15.476
If you are living with your ego and 
superegos, you cannot understand.

00:00:15.673 --> 00:00:18.963
As it is this is Mahamaya, no one 
can understand Her.

00:00:19.076 --> 00:00:23.291
Even Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha 
could not understand, it’s so tremendous.

00:00:23.372 --> 00:00:26.731
It has played tricks on Them also.

00:00:29.065 --> 00:00:32.121
But at least you’ll enjoy the play.

00:00:32.528 --> 00:00:35.187
You’ll be a vehicle.

00:00:35.268 --> 00:00:37.884
You ’ll be an instrument of that great power

00:00:37.965 --> 00:00:42.857
and you yourself will see how you 
play Mahamaya tricks on others.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.296
This is again a promise of Mahamaya, so be careful.

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:56.979
It’s already been said, you have already
noticed, you have already seen it,

00:00:57.686 --> 00:01:04.036
it will not reveal to you everything, because
you cannot bear it, the revelation.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.081
But slowly you will see it.

00:01:09.161 --> 00:01:12.234
But you must have power to bear it.

00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:20.558
If you have that power, then there cannot
be anything in between you and me.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.588
We all can become one with that.

00:01:26.379 --> 00:01:30.893
This Mahamaya power is the one
which has given you Realisation,

00:01:31.226 --> 00:01:35.712
is the one which is guiding you,
which is helping you.

00:01:36.425 --> 00:01:41.142
So many of you are still keeping to one deity.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.374
Like some people who were worshipping
Shiva, are still with Shiva,

00:01:44.455 --> 00:01:46.619
some with Vishnu, some with Christ.

00:01:46.699 --> 00:01:50.347
They’re all with me, all integrated.

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:55.483
They still go back to the same, I have seen.

00:01:55.564 --> 00:02:00.505
That’s a dangerous thing because
they won’t stand with you in that.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.207
Still the attachments are there.

00:02:05.288 --> 00:02:09.973
There are also very subtler attachments.
Get out of it!

00:02:12.252 --> 00:02:16.720
You should have only one attachment and
that is to Mahamaya, and nothing else.

00:02:16.934 --> 00:02:21.336
And that’s how it is going to work out further.

00:02:23.005 --> 00:02:28.490
It’s not difficult for you to understand
 because you have sharp intelligence.

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.851
But it doesn’t go in the heart, more in the brain,

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.138
while those who have lesser intelligence
 have a larger heart,

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:39.815
it goes into their brain very easily.

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.077
Supposing I go to India.

00:02:46.985 --> 00:02:48.752
You know all the villagers of India.

00:02:48.833 --> 00:02:52.131
What will give them the greatest pleasure?

00:02:52.211 --> 00:02:54.464
If I ask for something?

00:02:55.752 --> 00:02:58.660
Supposing I tell a poor man:

00:02:59.413 --> 00:03:05.760
“Can I have half a gram of gold?”

00:03:09.485 --> 00:03:11.565
He will never question.

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.249
He'll say, “There must be something,
She is Mahamaya,

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.365
if She has said it there must be something.”

00:03:18.446 --> 00:03:22.085
He’ll beg, borrow, steal, do something
and get it for me.

00:03:22.166 --> 00:03:31.560
Because he sees the complete dimension
of that saying

00:03:31.641 --> 00:03:36.186
that “You have to get me this.”

00:03:39.453 --> 00:03:41.794
He sees it, he knows it,

00:03:41.875 --> 00:03:45.488
and he’ll work it out in every way possible.

00:03:48.305 --> 00:03:52.197
What is to be done? He’ll not think
he has to borrow, he has to do this.

00:03:52.472 --> 00:03:55.246
He’s not bothered about this.

00:03:59.078 --> 00:04:02.970
There’s story of Shivaji which
I must have told you before also,

00:04:03.118 --> 00:04:06.667
that his Guruji wanted to take his test.

00:04:06.747 --> 00:04:11.486
Because Mahamaya is a testing… testing power.

00:04:11.567 --> 00:04:14.933
And he said… to his disciples he said:

00:04:15.014 --> 00:04:20.360
“I’ve got a terrible boil on my foot
which is about to burst out,”

00:04:20.473 --> 00:04:23.693
a huge thing he had here, tied up.

00:04:23.827 --> 00:04:27.252
“And it’s leaking now
with the pus is coming out.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.252
And I cannot get it cured unless and until
one of you can suck it.” - Imagine!

00:04:32.841 --> 00:04:36.605
How many of you would agree?
Won’t even think of it, isn’t it?

00:04:37.125 --> 00:04:38.252
What a test!

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.484
And especially Indians who are so worried
about their personal cleanliness.

00:04:42.565 --> 00:04:45.517
They wash their hands fifty times.

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.522
So everybody looked at it, quite worried.

00:04:55.842 --> 00:05:03.734
Shivaji had come that time.
And Shivaji said: “Alright, I will do it.”

00:05:03.842 --> 00:05:07.680
And it was a mango he had put in there.

00:05:09.441 --> 00:05:13.827
And he sucked it and he said:
“It’s very nice and sweet…!”

00:05:22.195 --> 00:05:33.240
One day again he asked that:
“I want the milk of a tigress.”

00:05:34.294 --> 00:05:40.186
Everybody was quite frightened.
Who is going to milk the tigress?

00:05:40.568 --> 00:05:46.051
Shivaji said: “Alright, I’ll go!”
He went in the forest,

00:05:46.132 --> 00:05:53.340
and he was looking out for a tigress
who has given her cubs a - they,

00:05:53.421 --> 00:05:58.860
they are even worse.
And he saw some cubs there.

00:05:58.941 --> 00:06:01.157
So he went near them and he started saying:

00:06:01.238 --> 00:06:04.565
“See, my guru wants your mother’s milk.
Can I have it?

00:06:04.646 --> 00:06:07.120
I want to have your mother’s milk!”

00:06:07.386 --> 00:06:10.255
The tigress was looking at him.

00:06:10.842 --> 00:06:15.876
And he bowed to her. He said: “You see,
my guru wants your milk. What am I to do?”

00:06:15.957 --> 00:06:21.591
And she could see that.
She came and stood before him.

00:06:21.701 --> 00:06:26.440
He had taken a pot with him.
He milked her.

00:06:27.028 --> 00:06:32.761
And he took that for his guru
because even a tiger,

00:06:32.842 --> 00:06:38.900
even a serpent respects
the dedication to Reality.

00:06:39.842 --> 00:06:42.285
And that’s what is lacking.

00:06:42.365 --> 00:06:45.734
And once that is lacking,
you cannot be respected.

00:06:51.321 --> 00:06:54.517
And you have to respect yourself.

00:06:54.597 --> 00:07:00.240
Whether others respect you or not,
makes no difference at all whatsoever.

00:07:01.048 --> 00:07:06.720
But if you have respect for you, you won’t
bother about what others have to say.

00:07:09.842 --> 00:07:15.870
I can make out people who are intensely seeking,

00:07:15.951 --> 00:07:21.475
who are just seeking, who are just here
because of certain relations are here,

00:07:21.556 --> 00:07:23.653
or something like that.

00:07:25.647 --> 00:07:29.639
Now those who are intensely seeking will get
what they have asked me for,

00:07:29.719 --> 00:07:34.061
and that has everything in it, everything.

00:07:34.241 --> 00:07:39.440
And those who are casual will also
get casual results, that’s all.

00:07:41.842 --> 00:07:49.716
So the intensity will be fulfilled
with much greater intensity!

00:07:50.936 --> 00:07:54.790
No use looking at others; look at yourself.

00:07:54.871 --> 00:07:58.763
If you are losing your joy,
you are no more a Sahaja Yogi!

00:07:58.844 --> 00:08:02.736
You have to be in joy,
then only you are a Sahaj Yogi.
