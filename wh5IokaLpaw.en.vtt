00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.360
First time when I came
to United States,

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.400
I came to Los Angeles first.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.680
Because it’s a place of angels.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.000
Actually, I thought

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:20.040
that it must be a very holy place
to come down first of all

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.800
in this great land
of United States.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.080
Now, as you know that United States —
or America, the whole of it —

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.240
is the Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.440
Out of which, we have three sides
to the Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.840
So, the central part
of the Vishuddhi Chakra

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.720
is United States.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.400
The central part
of the Vishuddhi Chakra

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.320
is governed by Shri Krishna.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.080
And His power is Radha.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.400
Ra-dha. “Ra” means “energy”,

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.240
“dha” is the one
who has sustained the energy.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.680
Ra-dha. Dha-re-ti-sa.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.920
So She is the one
who has sustained the energy,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.480
and so She is called as Radha.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.440
She is the power of Shri Krishna.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.680
The word Krishna comes
from the word <i>krishi</i>,

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.720
means “the ploughing”,

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.520
or you can say, agriculture
is called as <i>krishi</i>.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.240
The one who ploughs

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.040
and puts the seed in the soil
is doing the <i>krishi</i>.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.400
And that’s why He is called
as Krishna.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.040
Now, the seed that He has sown

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.240
is the seed of spirituality.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.600
It is Shri Krishna
who said, in Sanskrit:

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.920
“<i>Nainam chhindanti shastrani
nainam dahati pavakah</i>

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.480
<i>na chainam kledayantyapo
na shoshayati marutah</i>”
(Bhagavad Gita, Ch. II, V. 23),

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.680
meaning it cannot be —
means the spiritual life,

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.040
or you can say, the eternal life,
or the Spirit —

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.200
cannot be killed by anything,

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.360
by any weapon,

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.720
neither can be blown away by air,

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.040
nor can it be sucked in,
nor can it be destroyed.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.360
So, to prove that,
Christ came on this earth,

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.800
and through His resurrection
He proved what Shri Krishna had said.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.360
And most of you Sahaja yogis
know the relationship

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.760
of Christ and Shri Krishna,
why He was called Christ.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.760
Christ word comes
from the same — <i>krishi</i>.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.920
And His first name comes
from the word Yashoda.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.200
Yashoda is also called
as Jesu or Yesu,

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.400
and that’s why

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.720
Christ was called
as Jesu or Yesu.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.840
Some people call Him Yesu,
and some people call Him as Jesu,

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.760
because of Yashoda, the mother,
foster mother of Shri Krishna.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Also, you know that Radha
was the same as Mahalakshmi,

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:29.200
so She was the same
as the mother of Christ, Mary.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.120
These, all these things,
we can prove it in Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.360
Because when the Kundalini
moves up to the Vishuddhi Chakra

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.920
and if it stops there,
you can ask the question:

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.520
“Was Krishna the son
of Mother Mary—

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.200
was Jesus the son
of Mother Mary?

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:57.400
Was the son of Ra— was [Mary]
the same as Radha?”,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.880
and then the Kundalini moves.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.880
So Sahaja Yoga today is the thing

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.520
which proves
what has been said so far.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.840
It proves. It’s not
just a cock-and-bull story.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.920
Because people do not believe
into all these things.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.720
They think that it’s all
cock-and-bull story:

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.120
who was Christ, who was Krishna,
who was Radha…
after all, there was no God.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.480
But only in Sahaja Yoga, today,

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.720
we can prove it,
that what we say is the truth.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:32.360
Because, as through Realisation,
you get connected to the mains.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.680
Your vibrations start flowing.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.720
Like the computer,
you start working.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.560
And whatever question you ask,

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.440
answer comes to you
as tremendous vibrations,

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.320
or it stops, or you might get heat,
or you might get blisters…

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.160
So the whole message
is communicated to you

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.360
through your fingertips.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.240
As Mohammed Saheb
has very clearly said

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.440
that “At the time of resurrection,
your hands will speak.”

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.320
But the Muslims do not want
to talk about resurrection at all.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.040
Because they want to frighten
people with the doomsday.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.440
They don’t want to talk
about the resurrection time,

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.400
which is going to come,
which is the intermediary time.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.280
Because they want
to use the time

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.680
which will frighten people,

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.960
by saying that “Now your doomsday
is coming!”

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.320
“Now your doomsday is coming” —
so everybody is frightened about God,

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.000
and they think that “Now we should
just wait for our doom,

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.040
nothing else is in between.”

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.280
So this is how the Vishuddhi Chakra
is a special one.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:45.480
Now, Vishuddhi Chakra
was created on the Saturday.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.120
So it is the Saturn —

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.920
that’s the important star
of the Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.720
So, whenever the Saturn
is at the highest,

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.280
America will be in a better place
to do things.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:04.480
But I don’t think they know much
about themselves.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.760
They don’t know what they are,
why they are on this earth,

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.680
what is their work,
what they are supposed to do,

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.680
or what is the purpose of God
of creating America.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.960
The first job
of the Vishuddhi Chakra within us

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.800
was that when we became
human beings,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.640
we raised our heads up like that.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.120
When you raise your head up like that,
you have become a human being,

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:35.200
in the sense that now
there is a new movement

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.080
in your consciousness.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.120
Now, the new movement
in your consciousness

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.400
started about six thousand
years back

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.640
when Shri Krishna came
on this earth.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.800
That the new movement was
that it is the Father,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.600
the advent of the Father
was celebrated.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.000
And that’s how people developed

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:03.200
a kind of a new instrument
within themselves called ego.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.400
When the brain
was lifted like this, you see,

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.000
it expanded in a pyramidical…

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.440
it’s a pyramid,
it became a pyramid.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:17.920
In an animal, the brain is flat.
And gradually, it rises.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:22.720
When the head was raised,
when the responsibility was taken
of raising the head,

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.760
the brain started growing
in such a way

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.200
that it became a pyramid.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.600
And when it became a pyramid,

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.880
the attention became
a different attention

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.040
from that of animal.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:39.520
Because when the waves
of your consciousness

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.440
fell on the sides of the pyramid,

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:46.120
they went into the parallelogram
of forces,

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:51.160
by which the resultant force —

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.760
the resultant force —
now, it falls like this,

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.120
goes like that,
the resultant force is like that —

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:01.960
had two sides: one was this,
another was this.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.120
So the consciousness,
or we can say, the attention,

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:09.480
instead of going inside,
started going out.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.800
So one part of the resultant
was going outside,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.160
and that’s how,
when you became a human being,

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.360
your attention went outside.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:23.160
It’s the human beings only
who have their attention outside.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.200
Not that the animals don’t have,

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:29.000
but the attention
of human beings are such

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:32.000
that they create reactions.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.600
Like, you see something.

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.080
Now, I see doctor’s house there,
for example.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.240
Then a reaction starts
in my mind:

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:44.000
What is this?…
What does this mean?…

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:48.040
How much it must have cost?…
From where did he buy it?…

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:51.000
Anything you see,
it starts giving you a reaction.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.440
Not to the animals.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.120
Animals, at the most
they will say, “This I must eat.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.120
That I must eat.
That I must get.”

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.240
But they do not think about it.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:04.400
It’s only the human beings
who reflect.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:10.240
And this reflection comes
because of the pyramid-like structure

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.880
of the brain.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:17.600
And this has a special reaction
in the brain itself,

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:21.840
that we start developing
our own ego,

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.600
our own myths,
our own mental projections.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:29.040
And when we develop
our own mental projections,

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.640
this ego starts developing:
“I know,” “What’s wrong?” —

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.880
all these nonsensical
things come.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:39.720
And once that starts working out,
the balloon of the ego starts rising.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:43.320
It starts pushing the other balloon
which was within us —

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.480
is of the superego —
as an animal,

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.200
and then comes up in the centre.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:52.760
That’s how we now become
normal human beings.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:57.040
But then we start
increasing our ego.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:02.320
It starts overlapping
the superego,

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:08.760
and a calcification takes place,
by which we develop our “I-ness”.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:12.520
So it is all the happening
that takes place

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:16.560
after we have lifted our head,
raised our head,

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.720
and we are no more like animals.

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.760
So, Vishuddhi Chakra

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:26.160
has a very big part to play
in the human evolution —

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:29.680
that by developing
your Vishuddhi Chakra,

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:34.600
you have become
human beings, first of all.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:40.840
Secondly, because it is
the chakra of the Father,

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:44.760
who becomes again
the primordial…

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.480
as you call it in…

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:53.520
(Shri Mataji says
several words in Marathi)…

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:55.880
macrocosm,

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.560
you become the macrocosm.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.440
You are the microcosm,

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.880
and the Father is the macrocosm.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:09.200
So you become that
because of the Vishuddhi Chakra,

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.600
which is governed
by Shri Krishna,

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:15.880
who becomes that macrocosm
called as Virat.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:19.720
In the brain it is expressed
in this part,

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.240
in this part of the head.

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.400
It is here

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:30.400
that you start manifesting
your macrocosm qualities.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.120
At this point.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:36.000
Now, this Vishuddhi Chakra
has a speciality —

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:40.040
is that we always say,
“The responsibility on my shoulders.”

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:43.880
Always we say, “The responsibilities
are on my shoulders.”

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.640
The reason is,

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:50.080
the Vishuddhi Chakra gives you
the sense of responsibility.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:54.720
And that’s why, you know,
the Americans feel responsible
for the whole world.

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.920
Naturally.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.120
It’s perfectly understood

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:03.160
that they feel responsible
for the whole world.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:10.240
But how much they are aware
of their role

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:14.120
as the responsible people,
that’s a different point.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.120
But they feel
they are responsible.

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:22.000
But their role as responsible people
if they understand,

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.200
then they have to be ideals!

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:26.600
Ideals!

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:30.400
Because a person who is
the responsible person in a family

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.240
has to be the ideal for others.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:37.240
It started very well, I should say,
at the time of Abraham Lincoln.

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:38.920
It started very well.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:42.120
When you started talking
about democracy, is also…

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:45.160
democracy is nothing
but collectivity.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:50.440
He started talking about collectivity
“of the people, by the people”
(Gettysburg Address).

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:53.320
All that shows that the sense
of collectivity

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:58.040
started coming right
in this Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.840
But then,

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:05.760
the people who are in the centre

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:08.040
can only remain normal.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:11.080
But those who bend too much,

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:14.000
or who bend backward too much,

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.400
both suffer from problems.

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.480
The ones who bend forward
to others are the people

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:22.360
who get their superego.

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:26.600
They get over-humbled down,
like developing countries are.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:30.760
And those who bend backward
are the people

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.480
who try to dominate others,

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:35.840
who have ego.

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:41.520
So, because of sudden
blessings of God,

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.160
they discovered so many things.

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:48.080
The ego started developing
in America too much.

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:51.480
But ego is like a balloon,
as I told you,

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.960
and keeps you floating
in the air.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.720
And when you are in the air,
you become shallow people.

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.920
You have no moorings.

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.160
But it has one more advantage.

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.720
If you knew you are floating
in the air,

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:10.320
you can have a complete
comprehensive view,

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:12.920
complete vision of the whole —

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:19.120
if your eyes are pure
and your intentions are clear-cut.

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:25.480
Now, the another thing
that happened by their coming here

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:27.480
was the problem

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:32.600
that they felt that “We are
a very new nation.”

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:36.600
It has an advantage,
as well as it has a disadvantage.

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:41.000
To advantage is that if you are new,
it’s very good

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:46.080
because you can be transformed
into something better very easily

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:49.480
because there is no conditioning
in your mind.

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:53.800
You are very clean,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.840
absolutely ready
to become something great.

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:03.680
Or else, can be a possibility
that you are so new

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:06.480
that you are awed
by everything that is old,

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:08.880
which is very true
about Americans,

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:13.480
that they bought
all the old bridges from England

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.120
to bring them down here.

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:18.560
And the cravings about the old
is too much here.

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:21.200
And that as if whatever is new
is all absurd.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:24.400
So maybe even Sahaja Yoga
may be an absurd thing for them.

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:28.000
Because, according to them,
this is something new.

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:33.680
Because they are new nations,

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:36.680
they have started discarding
all that is new.

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:39.040
Is an absurd thing.

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:42.640
Now, we must say
that Sahaja Yoga, as it is today,

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:45.280
is the most ancient thing.

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:47.640
It started with the universe,

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:51.040
and now the culmination point
has come.

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:53.800
Because it is a living process.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.360
As you see a flower on the tree,
so you’d say, “First new flower.”

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:01.880
But the flower
has come out of a seed,

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:06.000
which has got the roots;
then it became the trunk;

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.040
then it became the leaves;

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:11.920
and then it has now become
a flower.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:16.800
So, though it looks a new flower,
it has a big heritage.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.440
In the same way, Sahaja Yoga
is as ancient as this universe is.

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:28.640
But to people who have
such a hankering for traditionalism,

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:32.160
find it difficult to find out
what is real tradition.

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:37.600
Only those who are traditional people
can know what is real tradition.

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.920
Last time I came here in America
and I was shocked:

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:44.520
that a person came
to interview Me,

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:49.000
and when he was talking,
he asked about one gentleman

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.360
who was most untraditional
from Indian point of view.

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:54.920
His name was
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa
(well-known Indian religious figure).

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:58.120
He married a woman
and made her a “Mother”
(Ramakrishna declared his wife
as an incarnation of the Divine Mother).

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:01.640
I mean, it’s… nobody has done it.
Rama has not done it.
Krishna has not done it.

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:04.080
An absurd stuff!

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:07.080
But for them,
he was the most traditional man.

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:09.760
And he told Me that “Mother,
your Sahaja Yoga is not traditional

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:12.240
if you don’t believe
in Ramakrishna.”

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:17.600
Last fifty-sixty years, all such
neo-traditional people came up.

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:21.640
Another one was this Pondicherry fellow
(Aurobindo, whose ashram
is situated in Pondicherry).

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:24.320
Another absurd situation.

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.040
He called this woman a “Mother”
(Aurobindo declared Mirra Alfassa
as an incarnation of the Divine Mother),

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:29.240
and his relation with her
is ambiguous.

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.520
You don’t know
what relationship they had.

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:33.840
I mean, that is something,
in Indian tradition…

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.680
is an impossible situation.

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:38.640
You have to have clear-cut
relationship with everyone,

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:40.560
you cannot have ambiguous.

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:44.200
Neither a friend, nor a wife,
nor a mother or a sister…

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:47.080
That kind of a situation
is most untraditional.

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.520
Is never thought of.

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.840
I mean, you Indians can know
this is not possible.

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:53.960
This is an absurd situation.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:57.520
But for some people,
he is traditional.

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:00.520
What happened
about sixty years back —

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.800
I think, about the time
of My birth only —

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.520
the negativity started taking
a new form

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:10.040
in understanding
the western confusion.

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:12.520
They are all westernised,
if you see them.

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.640
And the western confusion
they took over

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:18.040
for their own advantages.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.800
They used it
for their own advantages.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.640
And this is where the western people
have failed to make them out.

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.760
The other day,
at the Jungian place,

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:37.000
I was to talk to Jung people
about Sahaja Yoga and Jung.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.160
Now, Jung, I came to know
only when he died,

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:42.720
because there was a little article
about him.

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:44.720
I never studied psychology.

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:47.880
Of course, I tried to learn
some vocabulary to talk to them.

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:50.960
Sometimes, I thought,
I may have to talk to them also.

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:54.000
But these Jungians,
all very intellectuals and great people

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.640
sitting before Me, you see.

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:59.840
About a hundred of them,
[and] the President
of American Jungian Society.

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:04.040
I’d just gone through a book,
just before starting it,

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:08.560
and I saw some diagram
which really puzzled Me.

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.520
The first conception they had…

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:12.600
Of course, it’s all a mental
conception of Jung.

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:15.440
I don’t blame him,
because he got Realisation

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:17.840
but he did not know
how the state was created,

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:21.560
what was the framework
of the state,

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:24.320
and his movement
was still of a seeker

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:26.760
to find out how he got
his Realisation.

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:28.800
And all movements were linear,

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.640
they were not expanding
from one point all over.

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:34.000
So it was not so integrated.

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.960
Now, the thing they showed was

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:38.400
that at the bottom of it
was the unconscious

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:40.280
which is never going
to be conscious;

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:46.000
on top of that was the conscious…
unconscious that can be conscious;

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:50.560
then, there was subconscious;
and on top of that was the ego.

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:54.400
I mean, what a mess of a thing
it was, I tell you.

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:59.160
I told them, see, now, the word
“unconscious” itself is confusing.

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:01.040
What do you mean
by “unconscious”?

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:05.920
Whatever you don’t feel
on your central nervous system
is unconscious, all right.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:07.280
But what does that mean?

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:10.800
We don’t feel the subconscious —

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.240
then subconscious is also
unconscious.

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:18.520
Whatever we don’t feel —
for example, there are certain sounds

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:21.760
of certain frequencies
we don’t hear at all.

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:25.600
We hear whatever is tolerable
to us as human beings.

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:29.760
That you all scientists know.
We don’t hear everything.

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:34.160
So, all that is unconscious —
means it’s a mixed bag,

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:36.600
all sorts of things
mixed up together.

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:39.960
But God is not a hotchpotch
person, you see.

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.640
He is a clear-cut gentleman.

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:45.920
He knows what He is doing,
He is the greatest organiser.

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:48.720
And how can He put you
into a bag like that —

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:50.720
that the unconscious is below;

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:54.280
then on top of it is the unconscious
that is going to be conscious;

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.280
on top of it is the subconscious;

00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:00.040
on top of [it is] the consciousness;
on top of that, the ego!

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:04.360
So you go down
carrying all this inside you,

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:05.800
and where do you go?

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.360
Now, how do you go?

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.720
So the first mistake was

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:14.360
that there are layers
one on top of other.

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:15.800
It’s not so.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.320
They are placed vertically!

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:25.160
The ego is on the right-hand side,
and superego, on the left-hand side.

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:30.000
The future, on the right-hand side,
and the past, on the left-hand side.

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.600
So, the subconscious,
on the left-hand side,

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:35.160
and the supraconscious,
on the right-hand side.

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:37.400
And the central path
is kept clear-cut.

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.280
I mean, in any organisation…

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.960
say, if you go to the airport,

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:46.040
do you have like this
that you have to pass
through the walls

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.120
to go to the aeroplane?

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:51.800
If we human beings don’t commit
such horrible mistakes,

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.520
how can God commit
such a mistake?

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:57.800
So it was absolutely wrong
to think that way.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.960
So, the central path is
in the centre,

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.320
while the right side is
on the right side,

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:05.560
and the left side
on the left side.

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:08.640
And you don’t have to go
to the subconscious at all!

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:10.840
Because they justified
all these people

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:13.040
who are trying
to make them hypnosis,

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.640
or they are trying
to hypnotise them

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:19.680
or to give them a new type of a…
sort of an experience.

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.880
“All that was unconscious,
we should accept that.”

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:25.760
Even some people,
if they start suddenly jumping,
they say, “Oh, it’s great!”

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:28.000
So the sensations that you get

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.400
from the subconscious
and the supraconscious

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:32.400
were accepted
as something great.

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:35.760
It was a confusion
of your intellectuals, I should say.

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:36.960
Complete.

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.320
But it is not so.

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:43.400
Your path is straightforward.
Absolutely for Kundalini.

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:48.440
Only thing, the one who has to raise it
had to come, that’s all.

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:51.920
But otherwise,
it’s all very well,

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:56.440
and there is no need for you
to get into that horrible subconscious.

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:59.600
When I told them, they were amazed.
They said, “Mother, it is so simple!”

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:03.000
I said, “It’s very simple.
Your unconscious is divided into four.

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.880
One is the collective
subconscious,

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:09.080
one is the collective
supraconscious,

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:12.240
one is, you can say,
the collective hell,

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:18.440
and on top is the super-collective
consciousness.

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:23.120
So, where do we have to go?
We should know our destination.

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:25.480
Then, we have to reach it.”

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:29.360
And that is how the problem
of all these people

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:31.800
getting entangled with Muktanand
(founder of Siddha Yoga).

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.240
Yesterday they asked Me a question,
“What’s wrong with Muktanand?
Why is he so dangerous?”

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.720
One lady, poor thing,
as sahaj would have it,

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:42.880
she came, she said,
“Oh, I went there, I broke my back,
and I’m finished once and for all.

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:44.960
He is such a dangerous man!
He flattered me,

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:47.400
I went there, and I don’t know
what has happened to my back.

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:50.920
I can’t sit for more than ten minutes
in one place, I have to get up.

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:54.280
And I have a vibrator,
I have to always put it…” — like that.

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:57.480
So I said, “See. The dangers.”

00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:02.720
Then the another theory they started
that we must suffer
if we are to go to God. Why?

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:06.880
I mean, that’s not God’s idea
by any chance.
Why should you suffer?

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:08.880
He made Christ suffer for you.

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:12.360
Finished now, now you better not suffer.
There’s no need to suffer at all.

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:17.800
So, all these ideas penetrated
into these western people.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.840
And this mental projection
they accepted

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:25.000
without even understanding
what is written in other books.
We should see.

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:27.880
And they could only go
as far as those sixty years

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:29.720
when these horrible people

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:33.640
who went to India, very shallow people,
they saw some of these tantric books,

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:37.840
because they wanted to justify Freud
through Indian culture.

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:40.720
So they got the tantrikas,
erotic things and all that

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:42.200
and brought these books.

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:44.640
And some of them read
I don’t know what books,

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:47.760
to say that Kundalini [is]
in the stomach;
somebody says, in the brain…

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:49.640
I mean, they don’t know
where the Kundalini is.

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:51.400
And they are writing
such big, big books.

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:54.880
Can you imagine?
Such big, big books they have written!

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:58.560
Now, when the books are written,
every book is not a scripture.

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:02.360
But to them, if it is written
in the book, you see, it’s a scripture.

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:05.680
And that’s how the whole confusion
started going on.

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:08.640
So these people came down,
took full advantage of it,

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:13.120
and now they have become
“great gurus”

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:15.680
with lot of money.

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:17.480
Rich people.

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:22.400
But now,
as the hand of God is great,

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:26.880
one by one they are getting out

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:33.240
of the heads of these people.

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:35.680
And now I hope a day will come

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:38.240
when people will see
the light through.

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:43.040
So the task of Sahaja Yoga is
to establish the truth within yourself.

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:45.720
It is not that we can have
a membership.

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:49.000
We cannot have a person
enrol into it.

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:53.920
We cannot call them
as branded Sahaja yogis.

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:57.080
It’s the growth of the person
that is to be seen.

00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:59.640
Now, there are so many lectures
which I have given

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:01.840
about <i>ritambhara pragnya</i>
and all those things,

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:05.760
and I think for every Sahaja yogi
it is necessary

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:07.800
to listen to those lectures,

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.720
go through it, understand them,
and to meditate, so that you grow.

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:15.440
Because it’s not a plastic thing
that we can create.

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:17.600
It’s a living process

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:23.760
of the living energy
of the living God.

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:26.800
And so, it has to grow
within you.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.440
By thinking
you cannot make it grow,

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:33.160
but by not thinking
you allow it to grow more and more.

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:36.120
As it starts growing within you,

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:39.120
then only you realise
that what you are.

00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:42.920
That’s the only way you have to reach
a state of that super-consciousness

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:45.240
and establish yourself there.

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:48.320
Then only you will know
what I am talking about.

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:50.920
Now, today’s puja
is another thing.

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:52.880
Now, what is a puja?

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:55.000
Can you people say
what’s a puja is?

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.200
Actually, yesterday I had a puja…

00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:00.760
and it’s not easy for Me to bear
the pujas, to be very frank, you know.

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:05.280
Because the vibrations are so much
that… I don’t know…

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:08.720
And then I went to the airport;
two hours, we took out the vibrations

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:12.360
and put them
for all the New York airport.

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:14.800
It was necessary.
It worked out.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.320
Because vibrations start flowing
with tremendous force,

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:21.680
and if you people
do not absorb it,

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:25.320
it takes time for it to ooze out
from My body.

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:28.440
Makes Me rather heavy with it.

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:32.160
But then it oozes out,
I feel better…

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:36.200
And only thing that happens
by saying the mantras —

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:39.280
that you awaken the deities
within yourself

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:42.320
and start receiving
the vibrations.

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:45.520
And when your deities
are awakened,

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:49.800
they are awakened through the power
of the deities within Me —

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.920
they have to work very hard
to do that,

00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:54.600
and that’s how they emit
too much vibrations,

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:58.560
which must be absorbed by you
when your deities are awakened.

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:00.400
That’s how it works.

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:04.720
You cannot describe it in words,
you cannot tell it in words.

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:07.160
It’s a happening
that has to take place.

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:09.720
Many people who come
to Sahaja Yoga first

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:12.360
can go little bit like that
in the beginning.

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:14.440
Gradually they settle down,

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:18.040
come round, grow into it —
then it becomes all right.

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:21.640
Some people just shoot off
in one day, and they are there.

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:23.840
Makes no difference whatsoever.

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:27.720
Because it’s a growing thing
and it has to grow.

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:31.040
With some people,
the land is so fertile,

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:33.840
or maybe something,
that it just works out fast.

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:36.040
So, nobody should blame anyone.

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:38.200
And specially,
one should not feel guilty,

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.960
because that’s the Vishuddhi
on the left-hand side.

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:44.600
Specially for America,
I am wearing this stone,

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:47.120
which is called
as the black sapphire.

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:50.240
Because this is the stone
of Shri Krishna.

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:52.200
It’s the stone
of Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.680
Every chakra has a stone,

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:56.840
and this is the stone
of the Vishuddhi Chakra,

00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:01.120
so I am wearing this,
just for coming to America.

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:06.600
And I hope that today’s worship

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:13.720
will bring out the potential
of this country

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:17.920
by exciting the deities,

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:21.720
Shri Krishna himself,
who is in charge,

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:26.640
by pleasing Him,
by making Him active.

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:29.200
And He has great qualities,

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:32.760
and one of the greatest
qualities He has — that He has
the <i>samhara shakti</i>,

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:35.200
by which He can kill the demons.

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:37.760
And all those demons
who are settled down here

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:40.040
are really mistaken.

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:43.040
Because if this is the place
of Shri Krishna,

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:46.120
they are very dangerously placed.

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:50.480
Because once He is awakened here,
they all will be completely finished

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:53.320
through His Sudarshan Chakra,
which He has in His hand,

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:56.200
and He can just kill them
one by one.

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:59.880
But first, He is to be pleased,
and He is to be awakened.

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:04.480
He has to be…
<i>prasanna</i>, that’s the word.

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:06.360
<i>Prasanna</i> means “to be pleased”.

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:08.000
And then, it works out.

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:10.600
So today first we’ll have
Ganesha’s puja, little bit,

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:16.720
because Ganesha’s puja is meant
just to establish the innocence,

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:19.400
the innocence of the place.

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:21.920
Once the innocence is established —
that’s the most important,

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:24.600
that’s the essence of everything,
Ganesha is the essence! —

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:26.840
and then we’ll have
Shri Krishna puja,

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:32.240
and then the puja of the Devi,
of the Power.

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:35.400
So, that’s how we’ll have three pujas,
one after another,

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:37.560
but a short time every time.

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:40.760
All right?
