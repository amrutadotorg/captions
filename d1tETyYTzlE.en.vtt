00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.800
Today we have assembled here

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.120
to worship Shri Ganesha,

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.680
Shri Ganesha who is the Lord of Innocence.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:41.760
He is the ocean of innocence.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:53.760
And though He is such a young, little boy,

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.000
He can fight the whole world,

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:10.800
He can destroy all the negativity.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.080
That’s the sign of innocence.¶

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.480
There have been stories

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.160
that children who have fallen from a very great height

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.920
were completely saved, nothing happened to them.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:42.480
Their innocence is such a powerful thing

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.040
that it doesn’t harm anyone

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.400
who is not to be harmed.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.160
It has all the wisdom of the world,

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.920
all the understanding of the world;

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:09.920
and anybody who tries to harm the innocence,

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.080
the world, the whole world

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:21.360
which may not have cared so much for innocence,

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.640
might not have worshiped innocence so much,

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.680
but they all stand,

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.640
stand up against anybody who tries

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.560
to harm the innocence.¶

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:47.720
You can see in your own lives around you,

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.680
anybody tries to trouble children,

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.040
all of the them, whatever they are,

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.760
whatever they are coming from,

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.760
whatever maybe their nationality,

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.240
they all jump,

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:11.200
all jump to control and to safeguard that child.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.280
What is it?

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.800
What is it within us

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.360
that makes us so very conscious

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.320
to protect the innocence?¶

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.720
It’s really a shame,

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.440
a great shame for us,

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.720
when we find in this world

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
that innocence is under attack.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:49.120
Anything else can be tolerated.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.680
Innocent people who have done nothing wrong,

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:01.480
those who have no malice,

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:09.720
who are living like little children, I should say,

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.840
if they are attacked by anyone,

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.960
- not that the whole world reacts to that –

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.720
but every one of them

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.560
cannot bear any innocent person

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.280
or ‘innocent being’ being harmed.¶

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:46.480
We don’t realise that within us

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:53.760
there is the ocean of love

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:00.360
and ocean of understanding for children.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.480
Why? Why should it be?

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:09.440
Why should we feel like that, especially for children?

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.480
Especially for innocence?

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.480
There are people

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:20.240
who are always attacking innocent people,

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.480
innocent children, there are.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:29.680
But no-one wants to support them.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:37.000
No-one thinks that it’s proper to ill-treat children.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.600
And those who have done this have to suffer.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.400
They all suffer as a reaction.¶

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.520
What is it within us

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.000
that creates that reaction, that tremendous reaction,

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.320
against innocence?

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.040
For example if there is a regular war,

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.840
and if there are people fighting;

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.480
in a regular war, they don’t have much sympathy.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.760
In the world also, they say “Alright,

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:19.120
they are of that understanding, they are of that kind of a thing”.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:26.480
The greatest sympathy comes when innocence is being challenged.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.320
That’s what human beings have.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.120
Within themselves they have the power,

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.880
power of Shri Ganesha,

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:46.960
which gives you that feeling, that capacity,

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:55.640
that understanding that you have to protect innocent,

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.840
innocent children, innocent people.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.080
And the whole world can rise against all such people

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:10.480
who are trying to kill the innocent.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:16.920
There cannot be any doubt.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:22.840
If they cannot oppose such an attack,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.680
or criticize such a thing,

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:31.080
then they are not yet human beings, I would say.¶

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:41.920
The highest personality can sacrifice anything

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.240
and can give up anything,

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:52.400
but they cannot give up the feeling they have for innocence.

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.600
It’s very remarkable.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:02.000
We don’t realize how much there is this ocean

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:07.320
of protection and love for the innocent.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:13.000
What attracts the greatest strength

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:18.960
is when we see an innocent person,

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:23.600
innocent children, are under attack.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:27.400
That’s the beauty of human beings.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:31.920
Of course there are many human beings, who can be cruel,

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:36.520
who are, I would say, call them devils – maybe, maybe.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:44.600
But when it comes to children, and to innocent people,

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:51.320
everyone feels his responsibility.¶

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:58.680
It’s difficult for normal human beings to be innocent

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:07.480
because they have a kind of an understanding

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:13.280
that they are something great,

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.040
that they understand everything,

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.120
that they can analyze everything,

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.400
and they could be crooks,

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.400
they could be aggressive,

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:26.240
they could be troublesome,

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.800
they could be anything,

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:32.320
and they can give explanation for that, doesn’t matter –

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:39.160
but still, on the whole, they can never be respected

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:43.840
and they can never be honored

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.400
for the thing they are doing.¶

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:52.080
For us, the Sahaja Yogi, the Sahaj culture is

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:55.080
to respect your innocence.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.680
You might feel a little bit cheated,

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:01.600
you might feel a little bit dominated,

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:04.480
you might feel a little bit disgraced,

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:09.320
but Sahaja Yogi have to be innocent.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:14.160
Because with them lies the power of Shri Ganesha.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:20.600
They should not feel dejected if they are being used,

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:28.400
insulted, tortured, dominated, it’s alright.

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.520
They should not try to destroy

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:37.680
the innocence of other people, of anyone.

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.360
Automatically it will work.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:48.840
You will be amazed that when innocence is challenged,

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:55.880
all the goodness of the world comes to the rescue of that.¶

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:59.640
An example of this is the recent war,

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:03.440
so-called war, of America.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:08.800
Where innocent people – they had done nothing wrong –

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:14.600
have been tortured, have been killed.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:20.760
At that time, all over the world,

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:25.720
it’s a big support for them.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:32.840
Every country, whether it believes in those people or not,

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:43.240
is anxious to look after those who have done this crime.

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.680
They may not be belonging to the same religion,

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:50.000
they may not be belonging to the same country,

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:54.240
they may not be belonging to the same crimes,

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.760
but at this moment,

00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:01.160
who does not take the side of the innocence

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:07.800
will be singled out and will be destroyed – no doubt about it.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:11.320
Once for all they will learn a lesson

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:16.480
that ‘you cannot attack innocent people’.¶

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.400
I have told you, in Sahaja Yoga,

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:25.280
we should not ever be annoyed with out children.

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:30.720
We should not, in no way punish them.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:36.400
Our main achievement

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:42.080
should be that loving attention for children.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.760
All over the world,

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:50.560
whether he belongs to your family or to some other family,

00:12:50.720 --> 00:13:02.680
or has some sort of detached attention with you,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.680
still because he’s a child, he’s innocent,

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:12.600
the innocence within itself,

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:18.760
your own innocence, will try to protect.¶

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:21.880
It’s very surprising

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:26.480
how people take to sacrificing their lives

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:34.600
when it comes to the attack of innocence.

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:39.200
Children should never be attacked.

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:42.960
They have their own power to protect, no doubt.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:47.040
But you shouldn’t waste your energy on something

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:53.120
that is extremely inauspicious,

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:56.160
extremely cruel

00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:02.200
and extremely ugly.¶

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:05.360
If you cannot love children,

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:08.000
you cannot love anything.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:12.840
I have not come across anyone so far who says

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.120
that they don’t love children – luckily!

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:20.920
But maybe some might say “We love flowers”.

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:24.240
Why? Why do you love flowers?

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:27.400
Because they are innocent.

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:31.720
Because that beauty of innocence is within them.

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:33.720
You love nature – why?

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:36.640
Because it is innocent.

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:39.080
But the greatest innocence

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:48.360
is seen among human beings who are Sahaja Yogi!¶
