00:00:01.458 --> 00:00:11.542
Bugün bizler Adi Shakti‘ye ibadet ediyoruz.

00:00:12.625 --> 00:00:20.667
Bence en  önemli puja budur

00:00:22.542 --> 00:00:29.875
çünkü size aydınlanma veren,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.959
size gerçeği veren

00:00:34.417 --> 00:00:37.834
, size sevgi ve şefkat gücünü veren

00:00:38.083 --> 00:00:43.959
Adi Shakti‘nin gücüdür.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:06.000
Bu Sadashiva’dan ayrılan güçtür

00:01:08.291 --> 00:01:26.250
ve bu gücün kendisi kainatın tamamını yaratmak istedi.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:36.709
O (dişi) kainat üstüne kainat yaratır ve sever.

00:01:36.875 --> 00:01:45.125
Bu büyük yaradılışı yapan Odur,

00:01:45.291 --> 00:01:50.667
bu dünyanın yaratılışını da yapan Odur.

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:57.250
Bu özellikle seçilmiş bir gezegendir,

00:01:57.417 --> 00:02:04.000
nihayetinde  insanoğlunun yaratılması için

00:02:04.166 --> 00:02:07.625
güneşle ay arasında,

00:02:09.125 --> 00:02:17.000
çok güzel bir şekilde  merkezlenmişti.

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:30.291
Bu Onun öylesi bir sevgi ve şefkatle,

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.250
kendi çocuklarının gerçeği bilecekleri,

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:43.458
kendileri hakkındaki  ve diğer her şey hakkındaki

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.291
nihai bilgiye ulaşacaklarına dair

00:02:48.458 --> 00:02:52.583
büyük umutla (meydana getirilmiş)  büyük işidir.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.083
Adi Shakti`nin bir yılan formunda

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:09.917
nasıl geldiği ve insanoğluna,

00:03:10.041 --> 00:03:13.250
Adem ve Havva`ya,

00:03:13.417 --> 00:03:22.333
özellikle de Havva`ya,

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.709
bilgiyi bilmeniz gerek dediğini İncil`de okudunuz.

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:35.542
Ve onlar,  bilgi meyvesini yemeyi kabul ettiler

00:03:36.083 --> 00:03:41.000
çünkü yaşamın süptilliğini bilmeksizin

00:03:41.125 --> 00:03:44.959
ancak hayvanların olduğu gibi olacaklardı,

00:03:45.083 --> 00:03:48.709
belki de biraz daha yüksek havyanlar.

00:03:50.417 --> 00:03:57.208
Meyveyi bir kez yiyince,

00:03:57.917 --> 00:04:01.125
onlar giysileri olmaksızın bulundukları bu halde,

00:04:01.291 --> 00:04:05.250
bir şeylerin yanlış olduğunu hissetmeye başladılar.

00:04:05.792 --> 00:04:10.792
Bu yüzden ağacın bir kaç yaprağını aldılar

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.375
ve kendilerini örttüler.

00:04:14.917 --> 00:04:21.792
Yani gelen ilk bilgi,  iffetti

00:04:22.667 --> 00:04:28.125
çünkü Shri Ganesha yerleşmişti

00:04:28.333 --> 00:04:36.291
ve Onun etkisi, bu bedenlerimizi örtmeliyiz

00:04:36.458 --> 00:04:39.375
bilincini meydana getirdi.

00:04:39.542 --> 00:04:42.959
Bizler artık hayvan değiliz.

00:04:43.083 --> 00:04:47.041
Sadece hayvanlar,

00:04:47.208 --> 00:04:49.917
tabi ki onlar ayakta  durmuyorlar, bu yüzden bunda sorun yok,

00:04:50.041 --> 00:04:53.041
onlar bunun farkında değiller.

00:04:56.709 --> 00:05:02.000
İffet bilgisi ile,

00:05:02.166 --> 00:05:06.333
insanoğlu yavaş yavaş güzel uluslar şeklinde

00:05:06.834 --> 00:05:11.041
büyümeye başladı

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:19.333
ama hala bilmemiz gereken, farkında olmamız gereken

00:05:20.875 --> 00:05:23.750
pek çok şey var.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:32.417
Siz belki de pek çok şeyin farkındasınız

00:05:35.959 --> 00:05:45.875
ama spiritüel uyanışınızı elde etmediğiniz sürece,

00:05:46.917 --> 00:05:51.500
kendi benliğinizin bilgisini elde etmediğiniz sürece,

00:05:51.667 --> 00:05:58.000
diğer tüm bilgiler hiç bir şey değildir.

00:06:02.083 --> 00:06:07.709
Ancak bu öze dair bilgi ile güçlü olursunuz.

00:06:07.875 --> 00:06:15.417
Gerçek güç, gerçek güç sevginin ve şevkatin gücüdür.

00:06:18.583 --> 00:06:26.917
Bu gün, baktığınız zaman, tüm dünya savaşmakla meşgul

00:06:27.041 --> 00:06:32.750
ve onlar insanları savaştan korumaya çalışıyorlar

00:06:32.917 --> 00:06:37.667
ve büyük, kocaman koruyucak

00:06:37.834 --> 00:06:46.291
makineler yaratıyorlar.

00:06:47.583 --> 00:06:52.542
Tüm dünya, birbirini öldürmek, yok etmek,

00:06:52.709 --> 00:06:58.625
rekabet, hırs, savaşmaya öncülük etmek

00:06:58.792 --> 00:07:07.750
ve sonra daha da büyük savaşlara

00:07:07.917 --> 00:07:13.250
girmek için çılgın bir yarışın içinde gibi görünüyor.

00:07:13.542 --> 00:07:19.083
Bir parça toprak için savaşıyorlar.

00:07:20.041 --> 00:07:23.417
O kadar cahiller ki.

00:07:23.583 --> 00:07:32.250
Öldüğün zaman,  bir tutam bile toprak parçasını

00:07:32.417 --> 00:07:35.041
yanında götürebilir misin?

00:07:37.333 --> 00:07:41.291
Doğduğun zaman kapanmış yumruklarla geldin.

00:07:41.458 --> 00:07:46.500
Öldüğün zaman açık ellerle gidersin.

00:07:47.041 --> 00:07:50.667
Beraberinde ne götüreceksin?

00:07:50.834 --> 00:07:55.625
Tamam, belki de hiç bir şey almak istemiyorsun

00:07:55.792 --> 00:08:00.000
ama uğruna savaşıp çok büyük olduğunu düşündüğün şey

00:08:00.166 --> 00:08:03.458
her ne ise, bundan neşe duyuyor musun?

00:08:04.166 --> 00:08:11.000
Bu savaş bütün bu saçma sapan insanlar arasında neden sürüyor?

00:08:11.875 --> 00:08:21.166
Mesele bir parça toprak olunca,

00:08:21.333 --> 00:08:24.417
insanların kendi anlayışlarını,

00:08:24.583 --> 00:08:30.166
kendi huzurlarını nasıl bıraktıkları çok şaşırtıcı.

00:08:33.792 --> 00:08:40.000
Ve bütün her şey çok yanlış bir istikamete gitti

00:08:40.166 --> 00:08:46.458
ve tam bir yok edilmeye doğru gidiyor.

00:08:47.458 --> 00:08:57.375
İnsanoğluna bu kadar acı çektiren şeyler,

00:08:57.542 --> 00:09:05.500
onların kendi cahilliklerinden dolayıdır,

00:09:05.667 --> 00:09:11.959
bunlarla,  tüm bu alışkanlıklara,

00:09:12.083 --> 00:09:15.792
tüm bu cazibeye,tüm bu tanımlamalara sahip oldular.

00:09:15.959 --> 00:09:22.542
Bu şeyler,  onların bizlere yaptıkları bu şeyler,

00:09:22.709 --> 00:09:30.250
bu şeyler  onların hepsini tek tek mahfedecek.

00:09:32.333 --> 00:09:34.875
Onlar farkına varmalı

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:42.291
ve kendi öz bilgilerini almalılar.

00:09:42.458 --> 00:09:50.959
Bu öz bilgi, insanlara

00:09:51.959 --> 00:09:59.208
bir kurtarıcı vermek için anahtardır.

00:10:01.083 --> 00:10:04.917
Bir çok azizimiz oldu.

00:10:05.041 --> 00:10:09.166
Bir çok sufimiz oldu.

00:10:09.333 --> 00:10:13.917
Tao insanlarımız oldu. Zen insanlarımız oldu.

00:10:14.041 --> 00:10:20.125
Her tür aydınlanmış ruh bu dünyaya geldi.

00:10:21.125 --> 00:10:27.083
Hepsi acı çektiler. Hepsine eziyet edildi.

00:10:28.542 --> 00:10:36.083
Hiç kimse onları anlamadı ama şimdi sizler için gerçeği bilme zamanı geldi,

00:10:36.583 --> 00:10:43.125
ama kuru olmayan gerçeği, şevkati olan gerçeği,

00:10:43.291 --> 00:10:47.291
herkesi sarmalayan gerçeği,

00:10:47.458 --> 00:10:55.667
var oluşumuzun tam bir görünümünü veren gerçeği.

00:10:55.834 --> 00:11:02.291
Neden biz bu dünyadayız? Amacımız ne?

00:11:02.458 --> 00:11:05.417
Ne yapmalıyız? Adi Shakti’nin  güçleri,

00:11:06.667 --> 00:11:10.834
sevgi ve şefkatten gelir,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.583
......................

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:19.959
ilk olarak kendinizi anlamanızı sağlar.

00:11:21.083 --> 00:11:27.375
The love, for you, is very, very limited.

00:11:27.959 --> 00:11:35.041
There's no awareness of your own being.

00:11:35.208 --> 00:11:40.166
Just imagine what a great task is for you,

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:46.333
how much you have to be seriously

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:51.166
becoming aware of your self first.

00:11:52.208 --> 00:11:56.000
That is extremely important.

00:11:56.667 --> 00:12:01.250
First you have to be aware of your self.

00:12:03.417 --> 00:12:07.625
And now you have the light of your spirit.

00:12:07.792 --> 00:12:12.542
In the light of that spirit you can see what you are

00:12:12.875 --> 00:12:16.333
and you can see how far you are going,

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:20.125
how wrong things you are doing,

00:12:20.291 --> 00:12:24.667
what harm you are doing to yourself

00:12:25.542 --> 00:12:29.166
and you have a power to cure it,

00:12:29.333 --> 00:12:34.542
to improve it and to come to your senses.

00:12:34.709 --> 00:12:39.083
These are the most important times.

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:42.417
You will never get these times again.

00:12:42.583 --> 00:12:49.375
Never had it in the history and you can never get it in the future.

00:12:50.333 --> 00:12:57.291
This is the time you have got, not only the awareness,

00:12:57.458 --> 00:13:01.542
not only the self knowledge,

00:13:01.709 --> 00:13:05.750
but you know how to do it.

00:13:06.125 --> 00:13:09.250
Otherwise, about the saints,

00:13:09.417 --> 00:13:13.959
about those people, Tao and Zen people,

00:13:14.083 --> 00:13:16.792
they have just described

00:13:16.959 --> 00:13:23.709
what a person with self knowledge is,

00:13:23.875 --> 00:13:28.917
how he behaves, how his style is,

00:13:29.041 --> 00:13:32.041
how he's so different from others.

00:13:32.208 --> 00:13:37.250
But none of them have said how you become that.

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:41.917
No one has been able to say that.

00:13:42.041 --> 00:13:46.041
Nobody has been able to do that also

00:13:46.208 --> 00:13:54.667
because perhaps most of them didn't know about kundalini

00:13:54.917 --> 00:14:02.000
and those who knew also could not talk about it to people.

00:14:02.875 --> 00:14:08.250
So the greatest work of the Adi Shakti is

00:14:08.417 --> 00:14:17.709
to put the kundalini  in your sacrum bone.

00:14:19.834 --> 00:14:26.208
This kundalini is not the Adi Shakti.

00:14:26.375 --> 00:14:29.959
The Adi Shakti is a much greater thing, a much bigger thing,

00:14:30.083 --> 00:14:35.417
much wider thing, much deeper, much stronger,

00:14:35.625 --> 00:14:38.875
much stronger, much more powerful.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:46.709
Kundalini is the reflection of Adi Shakti power

00:14:47.875 --> 00:14:54.125
and when She rises you know what happens to you

00:14:54.583 --> 00:15:00.375
and how you get your Realisation.

00:15:01.583 --> 00:15:05.333
But you have to be very watchful.

00:15:05.583 --> 00:15:10.333
Are you really a compassionate person?

00:15:12.041 --> 00:15:14.917
If you are compassionate,

00:15:15.041 --> 00:15:18.583
the first thing that will happen to any compassionate person,

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:25.458
I think, will be to help others,

00:15:25.625 --> 00:15:28.375
to emancipate others.

00:15:28.542 --> 00:15:34.875
They cannot be satisfied with their own achievements

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:44.041
and with their own state of Self Realisation.

00:15:44.208 --> 00:15:46.667
It cannot happen.

00:15:47.083 --> 00:15:53.125
What was the need for the Adi Shakti to do all, all these efforts

00:15:53.291 --> 00:15:55.000
to work so hard?

00:15:55.166 --> 00:16:00.125
You know that, that I had to work very, very hard,

00:16:00.291 --> 00:16:03.792
but, from my very childhood

00:16:04.417 --> 00:16:07.333
I've worked very hard

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:12.792
and I've gone through very difficult times,

00:16:12.959 --> 00:16:19.834
very, very difficult times according to human understanding,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:26.000
but the worst time I have, when I see

00:16:26.125 --> 00:16:30.375
those people whom I have given Realisation,

00:16:30.542 --> 00:16:34.500
those who are self-realised people,

00:16:34.667 --> 00:16:42.291
they are the ones who have no responsibility for others

00:16:42.458 --> 00:16:46.333
and, if they have, it is very little.

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:49.667
They don't have that compassion

00:16:49.834 --> 00:16:52.709
and don't have that love

00:16:52.875 --> 00:16:56.542
that we have to today save the world,

00:16:56.709 --> 00:16:58.959
save the humanity.

00:16:59.083 --> 00:17:05.333
That's our — not only our principal work,

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:10.333
but the only work that we have to do.

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:15.875
All other things are going to achieve nothing,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.792
except for your own efforts here,

00:17:21.959 --> 00:17:24.625
individual efforts

00:17:24.792 --> 00:17:28.083
to give Self Realisation to others

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:32.083
and give them this knowledge.

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:38.125
This knowledge is so, so easy to understand.

00:17:38.291 --> 00:17:41.792
It is very subtle, no doubt,

00:17:41.959 --> 00:17:44.709
and, as I've told you,

00:17:44.875 --> 00:17:51.041
that the quantum theory they're talking about now, the scientists,

00:17:51.208 --> 00:17:57.125
is that they have seen those miraculous waves of lights

00:17:57.291 --> 00:18:02.417
and they are trying to find out something about it.

00:18:02.583 --> 00:18:09.625
It cannot be that some Sahaja Yogis will rise above others.

00:18:09.792 --> 00:18:16.917
Every one of you [has] to know that this is a very special thing

00:18:17.041 --> 00:18:20.125
that has happened to you.

00:18:20.291 --> 00:18:22.875
Even if you had gone to Himalayas,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.583
even if you have starved yourself,

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:32.041
even if you have been singing the praise of God for years,

00:18:32.208 --> 00:18:38.959
even   you had done all kinds of rituals and penances,

00:18:39.083 --> 00:18:41.917
you could not have got your Realisation.

00:18:42.041 --> 00:18:44.500
That would not have been possible.

00:18:44.667 --> 00:18:51.125
I knew this. That's why I have to work very hard,

00:18:51.291 --> 00:18:56.917
facing all kinds of problems, all kinds of turmoils,

00:18:57.041 --> 00:19:02.458
all kinds of pressures, what was the thing?

00:19:02.625 --> 00:19:09.458
Just to see that you all are created

00:19:09.625 --> 00:19:12.750
and you're all My hands.

00:19:12.917 --> 00:19:18.709
You have to work. Every finger has to work.

00:19:18.875 --> 00:19:21.709
And that is what I have been telling you,

00:19:21.875 --> 00:19:29.208
that now it is our responsibility to see that we become,

00:19:29.375 --> 00:19:36.375
not only Sahaja Yogis ourself, but blossoming time

00:19:36.625 --> 00:19:42.333
and many, many Sahaja Yogis we should have.

00:19:43.959 --> 00:19:48.625
It's a work of Adi Shakti.

00:19:48.792 --> 00:19:51.500
Try to understand this.

00:19:51.667 --> 00:19:55.458
It's not work of any saint.

00:19:55.625 --> 00:20:00.208
It's not work of any incarnation.

00:20:00.375 --> 00:20:04.250
It's not work of any politician.

00:20:04.417 --> 00:20:10.709
And not work of any big leader.

00:20:10.875 --> 00:20:14.917
It is the work of Adi Shakti,

00:20:15.083 --> 00:20:22.250
which is so transparently showing its results in you.

00:20:22.417 --> 00:20:28.291
Now it is for you to see.

00:20:29.792 --> 00:20:36.709
To please Me is your ardent desire, I know.

00:20:36.875 --> 00:20:46.375
I see how you love Me and how you want to do for Me.

00:20:46.542 --> 00:20:50.458
The greatest thing you can do for Me

00:20:50.625 --> 00:20:54.917
is to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:55.458 --> 00:21:03.125
It is a very special, extremely difficult blessings you have got.

00:21:05.917 --> 00:21:09.333
You didn't have to do any efforts.

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:13.583
You didn't have to pay any money.

00:21:14.375 --> 00:21:22.500
You don't have to get sick with rituals.

00:21:22.667 --> 00:21:26.709
You got it spontaneously.

00:21:27.667 --> 00:21:33.250
But that doesn't mean that it's sort of your birthright to get it.

00:21:33.417 --> 00:21:37.458
[It] is the work of Adi Shakti.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:49.709
And the work of Adi Shakti has to be shown in your life.

00:21:51.458 --> 00:21:59.750
[It] is the compassion, without any reward.

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:03.834
People have tried to spread their religion

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.667
by showing compassion to poor people,

00:22:07.834 --> 00:22:12.792
looking after the poor people, handicapped people.

00:22:13.875 --> 00:22:20.375
There's no need, actually, for Sahaja Yogis to do that.

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:26.709
What they have to do is to transform other people.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.125
Find out ways and methods how you can transform,

00:22:32.458 --> 00:22:37.083
how you can spread the message of Adi Shakti.

00:22:37.458 --> 00:22:39.750
Put your mind to it

00:22:39.917 --> 00:22:44.417
and you will know how you can manage it.

00:22:47.917 --> 00:22:55.000
There should be all the time compelling desire

00:22:55.125 --> 00:22:58.000
that we have to find out method

00:22:58.125 --> 00:23:01.959
by which we can spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:02.875 --> 00:23:09.125
Otherwise it's like what Christ has described

00:23:09.291 --> 00:23:16.250
that some seed fell on the marshy land

00:23:16.834 --> 00:23:22.750
and they sprouted, but never grew.

00:23:23.041 --> 00:23:30.166
You can only grow in the real sense of the word

00:23:30.834 --> 00:23:37.083
and become something very, very special and real

00:23:38.041 --> 00:23:44.041
by knowing what you can do.

00:23:45.291 --> 00:23:48.291
I have a vision, no doubt,

00:23:48.458 --> 00:23:52.667
and I've been talking about it quite a lot,

00:23:52.959 --> 00:23:59.291
but it ends up with the puja is not a good thing.

00:24:00.083 --> 00:24:04.333
I know some countries are very difficult.

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:08.583
Try to find out what is the problem,

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:13.709
why it is so very difficult.

00:24:14.709 --> 00:24:19.959
Attention has to be paid to this,

00:24:20.083 --> 00:24:27.709
that what other human beings are doing to destroy themselves,

00:24:29.125 --> 00:24:32.375
as if it is the part and parcel of the same game

00:24:32.542 --> 00:24:37.291
which we call as the last judgement,

00:24:37.458 --> 00:24:41.125
but let us, through our compassion and love,

00:24:41.291 --> 00:24:44.250
save as many as possible.

00:24:45.792 --> 00:24:49.792
This is the work of Adi Shakti,

00:24:50.333 --> 00:24:55.166
not the work of any saint or any incarnation.

00:24:55.333 --> 00:24:57.959
They're all there, no doubt.

00:24:58.083 --> 00:25:03.000
They're all with us, all the time to help us,

00:25:03.166 --> 00:25:07.792
but you people have the power of Adi Shakti,

00:25:08.166 --> 00:25:11.625
which is very great,

00:25:11.792 --> 00:25:15.583
which is very penetrating,

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:18.792
which is miraculous.

00:25:18.959 --> 00:25:22.208
It's so effective,

00:25:22.375 --> 00:25:28.333
but unless and until you become aware of your own powers,

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:31.500
how will you work it out.

00:25:31.667 --> 00:25:37.041
It would be like a dead machine that has everything,

00:25:37.208 --> 00:25:41.417
but nobody is there to work it out.

00:25:41.625 --> 00:25:48.458
All the time I had to go through very,

00:25:48.625 --> 00:25:51.542
very hazardous times

00:25:51.709 --> 00:25:58.458
and sometimes I felt that I may have to take another birth,

00:25:58.625 --> 00:26:02.542
the way things are so difficult for Me.

00:26:02.709 --> 00:26:09.166
But now, for you, it has been very easy,

00:26:10.083 --> 00:26:15.291
as if the one who makes the road has to work very hard,

00:26:15.458 --> 00:26:17.917
but those who walk on that,

00:26:18.041 --> 00:26:23.208
they don't realise how easily they have got it.

00:26:23.375 --> 00:26:29.667
And if they realise this, then they will realise also

00:26:29.834 --> 00:26:32.834
'Let many walk on this road,

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.500
which was created with such

00:26:35.667 --> 00:26:39.792
patience, understanding and love.'

00:26:39.959 --> 00:26:46.542
I have to really see you all Sahaja Yogis

00:26:46.709 --> 00:26:52.166
doing your level best to change this world

00:26:52.333 --> 00:26:54.333
— has to be changed.

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:58.250
As it is, humanity has to be saved

00:26:58.417 --> 00:27:02.125
through you and nobody else.

00:27:02.875 --> 00:27:06.917
No president, no prime minister,

00:27:07.041 --> 00:27:09.333
no minister,

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:13.291
none of these people can change the world

00:27:13.458 --> 00:27:15.208
and save it.

00:27:15.375 --> 00:27:18.291
It is you who are entitled.

00:27:18.458 --> 00:27:20.917
You have got this power.

00:27:21.083 --> 00:27:27.875
Do you realise your own status?

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.667
Your own being?

00:27:32.834 --> 00:27:36.375
which has risen so high?

00:27:36.542 --> 00:27:42.417
It is not there. If that realisation is there,

00:27:42.583 --> 00:27:46.417
you would go all out

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:53.542
to express your love and compassion to other people,

00:27:53.709 --> 00:27:58.959
to make them realise what they are.

00:27:59.083 --> 00:28:02.166
Only with Sahaja Yoga you can save this world.

00:28:02.333 --> 00:28:04.625
There's no other way out.

00:28:04.792 --> 00:28:11.500
Whatever you may try, say, to help the poor, to help this and that

00:28:11.667 --> 00:28:16.083
is something very, very superficial.

00:28:16.792 --> 00:28:24.375
Best thing is to give Realisation to every person you see.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.959
We have seen children. They're coming up.

00:28:30.083 --> 00:28:34.792
They'll be great Sahaja Yogis also. I can see that.

00:28:34.959 --> 00:28:41.000
But before them, you have to show your own merits

00:28:41.166 --> 00:28:44.041
of what you have done.

00:28:44.208 --> 00:28:47.125
It's not a static work.

00:28:47.291 --> 00:28:53.709
It's a big movement, which has to be really explosive

00:28:53.875 --> 00:29:03.208
and unless and until such a great step is taken,

00:29:07.625 --> 00:29:16.208
I don't know who will be blamed for the doomsday.

00:29:18.125 --> 00:29:23.583
You are the one[s] who have to build up

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:27.333
the destiny of human beings.

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:32.208
Don't consider as yourself, as something nothing.

00:29:32.375 --> 00:29:34.875
You could never have got your Realisation.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.083
You'd never have come to Me.

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:41.583
Among so many, you are the ones who came to Me

00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:45.875
and who asked for Realisation and got it.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.959
You know it cannot be forced.

00:29:49.083 --> 00:29:52.750
This Realisation cannot be forced.

00:29:52.917 --> 00:29:56.041
This awareness cannot be forced.

00:29:56.208 --> 00:30:03.250
And the growthof this awareness also cannot be forced.

00:30:03.417 --> 00:30:09.834
You have to develop that attention deep down within yourself.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.417
And see for yourself what you have done,

00:30:14.583 --> 00:30:16.750
what you have done.

00:30:16.917 --> 00:30:23.125
If you are still busy with the money problem or the power problem

00:30:23.291 --> 00:30:27.709
and this problem and that, you are a problem.

00:30:27.875 --> 00:30:30.250
You are not a Sahaja Yogi.

00:30:30.417 --> 00:30:34.458
Sahaja Yogi is above everything else

00:30:34.625 --> 00:30:38.208
and is very powerful.

00:30:38.375 --> 00:30:42.959
Power will be achieved by them

00:30:43.083 --> 00:30:45.792
— power of love and compassion,

00:30:45.959 --> 00:30:50.166
which is not only words of love.

00:30:50.333 --> 00:30:55.959
It is not only act of loving others,

00:30:56.583 --> 00:31:05.291
but it is a powerful personality that you will have,

00:31:05.458 --> 00:31:08.917
which will just emit

00:31:09.041 --> 00:31:19.375
that great Divine Light and can capture people.

00:31:20.125 --> 00:31:31.000
All should just take a very brave personality.

00:31:32.375 --> 00:31:35.083
I must say people have improved,

00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:38.375
otherwise everybody used to write to Me:

00:31:38.542 --> 00:31:42.709
'This is wrong with me and that is wrong with my father.

00:31:42.875 --> 00:31:47.250
That is wrong with my great-grandmother' and all kinds of things.

00:31:47.417 --> 00:31:53.041
That is over now. Much less, I must say, much less.

00:31:53.792 --> 00:32:00.917
But instead of telling Me about people who are sick,

00:32:01.041 --> 00:32:04.417
people who have failed,

00:32:04.583 --> 00:32:12.375
people who are still in a state

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:19.667
that cannot be improved, attention should be changed.

00:32:19.834 --> 00:32:25.959
If there's one person who has got cancer anywhere,

00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:30.166
immediately at least ten photographs will come to Me.

00:32:30.333 --> 00:32:33.792
Leader will write to Me. The wife's leader will write to Me.

00:32:33.959 --> 00:32:39.875
Everybody will write to Me that Mother, say such-and-such thing.

00:32:42.208 --> 00:32:48.500
Why? Is that My job?

00:32:48.667 --> 00:32:52.875
That person can be cured — we have hospitals —

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.291
can be cured by photographs,

00:32:56.458 --> 00:33:01.625
but attention always goes now to compassion part.

00:33:01.792 --> 00:33:07.166
To those people who are so-called suffering physically,

00:33:07.333 --> 00:33:11.959
mentally, emotionally, financially,

00:33:12.125 --> 00:33:15.000
also in the marriages,

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000
that's not your job,

00:33:21.166 --> 00:33:24.000
neither Mine.

00:33:24.125 --> 00:33:28.291
If they're sick, they should take a photograph and work it out.

00:33:28.458 --> 00:33:32.917
If it doesn't work, that means that it doesn't deserve.

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:42.750
There is no need for you to treat them and to work it out and,

00:33:42.917 --> 00:33:45.792
if it fails, to write to Me

00:33:45.959 --> 00:33:49.375
that 'Mother, such-and-such person is sick.'

00:33:49.542 --> 00:33:52.417
What's so important?

00:33:53.208 --> 00:33:59.250
Already we have so many healthy people going round.

00:33:59.417 --> 00:34:01.625
Why not use them first?

00:34:01.792 --> 00:34:05.959
Our job is not to cure people.

00:34:06.125 --> 00:34:11.000
Affection is all right. Compassion is all right. Is a natural thing

00:34:11.125 --> 00:34:17.875
that our attention goes to sick people or to the poor people

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.500
or to the people who are suffering,

00:34:22.667 --> 00:34:27.959
but what about Sahaj Yog?

00:34:31.291 --> 00:34:34.583
If you have one sick person,

00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:38.875
hundred Sahaja Yogis will get after that.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.250
What is the reason?

00:34:42.417 --> 00:34:46.333
Is it compassion?

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:48.709
It's not.

00:34:50.417 --> 00:34:57.000
They want to prove that they can cure that person.

00:34:57.959 --> 00:35:00.875
Is not compassion.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.291
Compassion today is

00:35:04.458 --> 00:35:10.834
to transform human beings into Sahajis,

00:35:11.208 --> 00:35:14.625
into good people.

00:35:14.792 --> 00:35:18.875
That is the love of Adi Shakti.

00:35:19.333 --> 00:35:23.083
Because those who are born have to die in any case.

00:35:23.250 --> 00:35:27.417
We should not be unkind, of course, but

00:35:27.583 --> 00:35:33.917
our attention should be how many people we are giving Realisation.

00:35:34.333 --> 00:35:37.291
Is a very common thing

00:35:37.458 --> 00:35:43.041
that people indulge more into so-called curing

00:35:43.208 --> 00:35:48.792
and improving and this. It's all right.

00:35:49.125 --> 00:35:54.333
Also there are problems like in the marriages, you see.

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:57.792
Some marriage couple don't want to be there.

00:35:57.959 --> 00:36:01.375
It's all right. Finish them.

00:36:02.333 --> 00:36:06.500
If they don't want to live together, let them.

00:36:07.208 --> 00:36:10.959
We have many people who are sensible in this world,

00:36:11.083 --> 00:36:14.917
many people who are healthy in this world.

00:36:15.583 --> 00:36:18.417
Now how can you go on struggling with people

00:36:18.583 --> 00:36:22.458
who don't want to live together and have problems?

00:36:23.166 --> 00:36:25.750
That's not your job.

00:36:25.917 --> 00:36:29.000
First of all, you are a spiritual worker.

00:36:29.125 --> 00:36:32.291
You are not a social worker.

00:36:32.458 --> 00:36:34.000
Of course,

00:36:34.166 --> 00:36:39.542
by the way, you can do social work. It doesn't matter, by the way.

00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:47.291
But the main thing for you is to transform human beings.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.750
With that, the greatest disease

00:36:52.917 --> 00:36:58.583
is of meanness, of cruelty,

00:37:01.083 --> 00:37:06.709
of torturing others, anger.

00:37:07.667 --> 00:37:11.375
All these diseases can be cured,

00:37:11.542 --> 00:37:15.583
which are internal, not external.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.291
That is today wanted.

00:37:18.458 --> 00:37:22.458
Every country's fighting and is tortured

00:37:22.625 --> 00:37:29.792
and is in peril all the time of getting destroyed.

00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:36.041
The only way you can do it is to give them Realisation.

00:37:36.208 --> 00:37:40.834
Now what happens is to be seen very clearly

00:37:41.625 --> 00:37:47.041
that when you give Realisation to someone

00:37:47.208 --> 00:37:52.750
and he values it, and he grows into it,

00:37:52.959 --> 00:37:57.417
then you are protected.

00:37:57.583 --> 00:38:01.417
You are completely protected.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.792
Who protects you, you may say?

00:38:05.959 --> 00:38:08.875
The Adi Shakti, all right,

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:16.667
but also there is a destructive power working in this world,

00:38:16.834 --> 00:38:23.500
not of negativity, but positive destructive power of Shiva.

00:38:24.041 --> 00:38:35.583
If He says that if Adi Shakti's work is going on well, He's happy.

00:38:35.875 --> 00:38:39.625
But He's sitting there and watching each and every person,

00:38:39.792 --> 00:38:43.458
each and every work of Sahaja Yogis

00:38:43.625 --> 00:38:51.959
and if He finds something really very wrong,

00:38:52.125 --> 00:38:55.709
I cannot control it.

00:38:55.959 --> 00:39:02.458
He destroys. I cannot go to that point.

00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:06.250
He destroys.

00:39:06.417 --> 00:39:14.125
Not only destroys, but thousands He can destroy.

00:39:17.917 --> 00:39:21.750
Anywhere there is a calamity,

00:39:21.917 --> 00:39:28.917
we can say, like an earthquake

00:39:29.041 --> 00:39:33.583
or some sort of a hurricane,

00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:35.583
all these things come

00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:43.625
through the working of Shri Mahadeva.

00:39:44.875 --> 00:39:48.208
I can't help you there,

00:39:48.667 --> 00:39:54.041
but if you really give Realisation to people,

00:39:55.792 --> 00:39:59.417
all these can be averted.

00:40:00.333 --> 00:40:06.375
Of course, it is the whim, I should say, of Adi Shakti

00:40:06.542 --> 00:40:10.959
that She started this work of creating this world,

00:40:11.083 --> 00:40:16.250
of creating you and making you Sahaja Yogis,

00:40:16.458 --> 00:40:20.792
but your responsibility is also very important.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.667
You cannot be responsible.

00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:40.375
Maybe it was, I felt, My responsibility, but there's a difference.

00:40:42.125 --> 00:40:46.583
I never felt it was My responsibility,

00:40:47.667 --> 00:40:51.542
never felt this was My job,

00:40:51.709 --> 00:40:54.792
never felt I have to do it.

00:40:54.959 --> 00:40:57.417
'I did it.'

00:41:00.792 --> 00:41:02.750
That is the work.

00:41:02.917 --> 00:41:07.166
That's the kind of personality you should have.

00:41:07.333 --> 00:41:13.208
You have to do it in a very humble manner,

00:41:15.333 --> 00:41:19.875
in a very beautiful manner

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:25.166
and you'll be amazed to see how you are protected,

00:41:25.333 --> 00:41:31.875
how you are supported and how everything works out.

00:41:32.125 --> 00:41:35.750
The greatest joy you will get when you will find

00:41:35.917 --> 00:41:39.000
you can give Realisation to people.

00:41:40.667 --> 00:41:44.208
You can change their lives.

00:41:44.917 --> 00:41:47.208
Never you would feel such joy,

00:41:47.375 --> 00:41:55.333
even if you get, say, a big lottery maybe,

00:41:55.875 --> 00:41:59.792
a big job or a big name

00:41:59.959 --> 00:42:06.375
or a very big award, no.

00:42:07.333 --> 00:42:12.542
The joy of creating Sahaja Yogis

00:42:13.375 --> 00:42:18.208
knows no bounds,

00:42:18.834 --> 00:42:22.709
is such a joy-giving thing.

00:42:23.792 --> 00:42:28.792
You develop such fraternities,

00:42:28.959 --> 00:42:35.000
such solidarity, as they call it, such oneness,

00:42:35.375 --> 00:42:40.208
such enjoyment of love,

00:42:40.667 --> 00:42:43.875
enjoyment of compassion.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.834
It's a different level of enjoyment

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.041
that's not like ordinary enjoyments.

00:42:54.375 --> 00:42:57.792
You're not to be afraid of Me,

00:42:57.959 --> 00:43:02.166
but be afraid of yourself.

00:43:02.333 --> 00:43:06.041
Have a watch on yourself and see for yourself

00:43:06.208 --> 00:43:09.792
what have you been doing so far.

00:43:09.959 --> 00:43:13.166
What have you done so far?

00:43:13.333 --> 00:43:19.667
Because you have been enlightened.

00:43:20.417 --> 00:43:23.375
If the enlightened people

00:43:23.542 --> 00:43:27.375
cannot give light, what's the use in having them?

00:43:27.542 --> 00:43:30.291
Look at these little, little candles.

00:43:30.458 --> 00:43:36.208
Whatever little light they have, they're giving that light.

00:43:36.375 --> 00:43:40.333
They're burning themselves to give that light.

00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:46.583
If we cannot give that light,

00:43:47.875 --> 00:43:52.125
what is the use of enlightenment?

00:43:53.291 --> 00:43:58.000
Enlightened doesn't mean the light for yourself only

00:43:58.166 --> 00:44:03.041
the light of love, compassion,

00:44:03.208 --> 00:44:09.959
which is divine, which is not normal, which is not ordinary,

00:44:10.083 --> 00:44:12.875
as you see in the films.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:18.375
It is a divine love which works

00:44:19.583 --> 00:44:24.625
and that is what makes Me sometimes little weak

00:44:24.792 --> 00:44:28.166
when I hear that Sahaja Yogis now

00:44:28.333 --> 00:44:32.917
are getting involved in money, in cheating.

00:44:33.041 --> 00:44:37.625
I mean, all kinds of criminal activities they do.

00:44:37.792 --> 00:44:41.542
I can't understand. I can't believe it.

00:44:41.709 --> 00:44:45.667
After getting the highest,

00:44:45.834 --> 00:44:51.667
why do you want to go so low as that?

00:44:51.834 --> 00:44:57.500
Because you have not yet felt what you have got.

00:44:59.041 --> 00:45:03.291
You have not realised what you have got.

00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:09.166
And you don't respect yourself.

00:45:09.583 --> 00:45:16.542
Still, if you are on the same line and the same level,

00:45:16.709 --> 00:45:27.417
I must say you have done no justice to Me or to yourself.

00:45:27.959 --> 00:45:31.500
We have to work it out.

00:45:31.667 --> 00:45:35.125
Single-handed, I've done it,

00:45:35.291 --> 00:45:38.917
worked very hard, I must say,

00:45:39.041 --> 00:45:46.208
in the sense that I had to deal with horrible people,

00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:54.959
very unkind, very selfish, very cruel.

00:45:55.709 --> 00:45:58.667
That doesn't matter.

00:46:01.041 --> 00:46:05.083
And such beautiful birds I have discovered.

00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:10.417
But you must keep your lustre

00:46:10.583 --> 00:46:13.458
and work it out.

00:46:13.625 --> 00:46:20.500
I'll be very happy to know that Sahaja Yoga is spreading

00:46:20.667 --> 00:46:25.291
with leaps and bounds, with great speed

00:46:25.458 --> 00:46:29.166
and that people are really

00:46:29.333 --> 00:46:37.250
getting into that realm

00:46:37.792 --> 00:46:44.709
of peace, joy and happiness.

00:46:44.875 --> 00:46:47.667
That's My dream

00:46:47.834 --> 00:46:51.792
and I hope you all will all work it out.

00:46:52.208 --> 00:46:54.917
Thank you very much.
