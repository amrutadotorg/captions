00:01.458 --> 00:11.542
Bugün bizler Adi Shakti‘ye ibadet ediyoruz.

00:12.625 --> 00:20.667
Bence en  önemli puja budur

00:22.542 --> 00:29.875
çünkü size aydınlanma veren,

00:30.000 --> 00:33.959
size gerçeği veren

00:34.417 --> 00:37.834
, size sevgi ve şefkat gücünü veren

00:38.083 --> 00:43.959
Adi Shakti‘nin gücüdür.

00:55.250 --> 01:06.000
Bu Sadashiva’dan ayrılan güçtür

01:08.291 --> 01:26.250
ve bu gücün kendisi kainatın tamamını yaratmak istedi.

01:26.750 --> 01:36.709
O (dişi) kainat üstüne kainat yaratır ve sever.

01:36.875 --> 01:45.125
Bu büyük yaradılışı yapan Odur,

01:45.291 --> 01:50.667
bu dünyanın yaratılışını da yapan Odur.

01:50.959 --> 01:57.250
Bu özellikle seçilmiş bir gezegendir,

01:57.417 --> 02:04.000
nihayetinde  insanoğlunun yaratılması için

02:04.166 --> 02:07.625
güneşle ay arasında,

02:09.125 --> 02:17.000
çok güzel bir şekilde  merkezlenmişti.

02:18.959 --> 02:30.291
Bu Onun öylesi bir sevgi ve şefkatle,

02:30.959 --> 02:34.250
kendi çocuklarının gerçeği bilecekleri,

02:35.750 --> 02:43.458
kendileri hakkındaki  ve diğer her şey hakkındaki

02:43.959 --> 02:48.291
nihai bilgiye ulaşacaklarına dair

02:48.458 --> 02:52.583
büyük umutla (meydana getirilmiş)  büyük işidir.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.083
Adi Shakti`nin bir yılan formunda

03:03.250 --> 03:09.917
nasıl geldiği ve insanoğluna,

03:10.041 --> 03:13.250
Adem ve Havva`ya,

03:13.417 --> 03:22.333
özellikle de Havva`ya,

03:22.500 --> 03:28.709
bilgiyi bilmeniz gerek dediğini İncil`de okudunuz.

03:28.875 --> 03:35.542
Ve onlar,  bilgi meyvesini yemeyi kabul ettiler

03:36.083 --> 03:41.000
çünkü yaşamın süptilliğini bilmeksizin

03:41.125 --> 03:44.959
ancak hayvanların olduğu gibi olacaklardı,

03:45.083 --> 03:48.709
belki de biraz daha yüksek havyanlar.

03:50.417 --> 03:57.208
Meyveyi bir kez yiyince,

03:57.917 --> 04:01.125
onlar giysileri olmaksızın bulundukları bu halde,

04:01.291 --> 04:05.250
bir şeylerin yanlış olduğunu hissetmeye başladılar.

04:05.792 --> 04:10.792
Bu yüzden ağacın bir kaç yaprağını aldılar

04:10.959 --> 04:14.375
ve kendilerini örttüler.

04:14.917 --> 04:21.792
Yani gelen ilk bilgi,  iffetti

04:22.667 --> 04:28.125
çünkü Shri Ganesha yerleşmişti

04:28.333 --> 04:36.291
ve Onun etkisi, bu bedenlerimizi örtmeliyiz

04:36.458 --> 04:39.375
bilincini meydana getirdi.

04:39.542 --> 04:42.959
Bizler artık hayvan değiliz.

04:43.083 --> 04:47.041
Sadece hayvanlar,

04:47.208 --> 04:49.917
tabi ki onlar ayakta  durmuyorlar, bu yüzden bunda sorun yok,

04:50.041 --> 04:53.041
onlar bunun farkında değiller.

04:56.709 --> 05:02.000
İffet bilgisi ile,

05:02.166 --> 05:06.333
insanoğlu yavaş yavaş güzel uluslar şeklinde

05:06.834 --> 05:11.041
büyümeye başladı

05:12.750 --> 05:19.333
ama hala bilmemiz gereken, farkında olmamız gereken

05:20.875 --> 05:23.750
pek çok şey var.

05:24.750 --> 05:32.417
Siz belki de pek çok şeyin farkındasınız

05:35.959 --> 05:45.875
ama spiritüel uyanışınızı elde etmediğiniz sürece,

05:46.917 --> 05:51.500
kendi benliğinizin bilgisini elde etmediğiniz sürece,

05:51.667 --> 05:58.000
diğer tüm bilgiler hiç bir şey değildir.

06:02.083 --> 06:07.709
Ancak bu öze dair bilgi ile güçlü olursunuz.

06:07.875 --> 06:15.417
Gerçek güç, gerçek güç sevginin ve şevkatin gücüdür.

06:18.583 --> 06:26.917
Bu gün, baktığınız zaman, tüm dünya savaşmakla meşgul

06:27.041 --> 06:32.750
ve onlar insanları savaştan korumaya çalışıyorlar

06:32.917 --> 06:37.667
ve büyük, kocaman koruyucak

06:37.834 --> 06:46.291
makineler yaratıyorlar.

06:47.583 --> 06:52.542
Tüm dünya, birbirini öldürmek, yok etmek,

06:52.709 --> 06:58.625
rekabet, hırs, savaşmaya öncülük etmek

06:58.792 --> 07:07.750
ve sonra daha da büyük savaşlara

07:07.917 --> 07:13.250
girmek için çılgın bir yarışın içinde gibi görünüyor.

07:13.542 --> 07:19.083
Bir parça toprak için savaşıyorlar.

07:20.041 --> 07:23.417
O kadar cahiller ki.

07:23.583 --> 07:32.250
Öldüğün zaman,  bir tutam bile toprak parçasını

07:32.417 --> 07:35.041
yanında götürebilir misin?

07:37.333 --> 07:41.291
Doğduğun zaman kapanmış yumruklarla geldin.

07:41.458 --> 07:46.500
Öldüğün zaman açık ellerle gidersin.

07:47.041 --> 07:50.667
Beraberinde ne götüreceksin?

07:50.834 --> 07:55.625
Tamam, belki de hiç bir şey almak istemiyorsun

07:55.792 --> 08:00.000
ama uğruna savaşıp çok büyük olduğunu düşündüğün şey

08:00.166 --> 08:03.458
her ne ise, bundan neşe duyuyor musun?

08:04.166 --> 08:11.000
Bu savaş bütün bu saçma sapan insanlar arasında neden sürüyor?

08:11.875 --> 08:21.166
Mesele bir parça toprak olunca,

08:21.333 --> 08:24.417
insanların kendi anlayışlarını,

08:24.583 --> 08:30.166
kendi huzurlarını nasıl bıraktıkları çok şaşırtıcı.

08:33.792 --> 08:40.000
Ve bütün her şey çok yanlış bir istikamete gitti

08:40.166 --> 08:46.458
ve tam bir yok edilmeye doğru gidiyor.

08:47.458 --> 08:57.375
İnsanoğluna bu kadar acı çektiren şeyler,

08:57.542 --> 09:05.500
onların kendi cahilliklerinden dolayıdır,

09:05.667 --> 09:11.959
bunlarla,  tüm bu alışkanlıklara,

09:12.083 --> 09:15.792
tüm bu cazibeye,tüm bu tanımlamalara sahip oldular.

09:15.959 --> 09:22.542
Bu şeyler,  onların bizlere yaptıkları bu şeyler,

09:22.709 --> 09:30.250
bu şeyler  onların hepsini tek tek mahfedecek.

09:32.333 --> 09:34.875
Onlar farkına varmalı

09:35.000 --> 09:42.291
ve kendi öz bilgilerini almalılar.

09:42.458 --> 09:50.959
Bu öz bilgi, insanlara

09:51.959 --> 09:59.208
bir kurtarıcı vermek için anahtardır.

10:01.083 --> 10:04.917
Bir çok azizimiz oldu.

10:05.041 --> 10:09.166
Bir çok sufimiz oldu.

10:09.333 --> 10:13.917
Tao insanlarımız oldu. Zen insanlarımız oldu.

10:14.041 --> 10:20.125
Her tür aydınlanmış ruh bu dünyaya geldi.

10:21.125 --> 10:27.083
Hepsi acı çektiler. Hepsine eziyet edildi.

10:28.542 --> 10:36.083
Hiç kimse onları anlamadı ama şimdi sizler için gerçeği bilme zamanı geldi,

10:36.583 --> 10:43.125
ama kuru olmayan gerçeği, şevkati olan gerçeği,

10:43.291 --> 10:47.291
herkesi sarmalayan gerçeği,

10:47.458 --> 10:55.667
var oluşumuzun tam bir görünümünü veren gerçeği.

10:55.834 --> 11:02.291
Neden biz bu dünyadayız? Amacımız ne?

11:02.458 --> 11:05.417
Ne yapmalıyız? Adi Shakti’nin  güçleri,

11:06.667 --> 11:10.834
sevgi ve şefkatten gelir,

11:11.000 --> 11:14.583
......................

11:14.750 --> 11:19.959
ilk olarak kendinizi anlamanızı sağlar.

11:21.083 --> 11:27.375
The love, for you, is very, very limited.

11:27.959 --> 11:35.041
There's no awareness of your own being.

11:35.208 --> 11:40.166
Just imagine what a great task is for you,

11:40.750 --> 11:46.333
how much you have to be seriously

11:46.500 --> 11:51.166
becoming aware of your self first.

11:52.208 --> 11:56.000
That is extremely important.

11:56.667 --> 12:01.250
First you have to be aware of your self.

12:03.417 --> 12:07.625
And now you have the light of your spirit.

12:07.792 --> 12:12.542
In the light of that spirit you can see what you are

12:12.875 --> 12:16.333
and you can see how far you are going,

12:16.500 --> 12:20.125
how wrong things you are doing,

12:20.291 --> 12:24.667
what harm you are doing to yourself

12:25.542 --> 12:29.166
and you have a power to cure it,

12:29.333 --> 12:34.542
to improve it and to come to your senses.

12:34.709 --> 12:39.083
These are the most important times.

12:39.250 --> 12:42.417
You will never get these times again.

12:42.583 --> 12:49.375
Never had it in the history and you can never get it in the future.

12:50.333 --> 12:57.291
This is the time you have got, not only the awareness,

12:57.458 --> 13:01.542
not only the self knowledge,

13:01.709 --> 13:05.750
but you know how to do it.

13:06.125 --> 13:09.250
Otherwise, about the saints,

13:09.417 --> 13:13.959
about those people, Tao and Zen people,

13:14.083 --> 13:16.792
they have just described

13:16.959 --> 13:23.709
what a person with self knowledge is,

13:23.875 --> 13:28.917
how he behaves, how his style is,

13:29.041 --> 13:32.041
how he's so different from others.

13:32.208 --> 13:37.250
But none of them have said how you become that.

13:38.250 --> 13:41.917
No one has been able to say that.

13:42.041 --> 13:46.041
Nobody has been able to do that also

13:46.208 --> 13:54.667
because perhaps most of them didn't know about kundalini

13:54.917 --> 14:02.000
and those who knew also could not talk about it to people.

14:02.875 --> 14:08.250
So the greatest work of the Adi Shakti is

14:08.417 --> 14:17.709
to put the kundalini  in your sacrum bone.

14:19.834 --> 14:26.208
This kundalini is not the Adi Shakti.

14:26.375 --> 14:29.959
The Adi Shakti is a much greater thing, a much bigger thing,

14:30.083 --> 14:35.417
much wider thing, much deeper, much stronger,

14:35.625 --> 14:38.875
much stronger, much more powerful.

14:39.000 --> 14:46.709
Kundalini is the reflection of Adi Shakti power

14:47.875 --> 14:54.125
and when She rises you know what happens to you

14:54.583 --> 15:00.375
and how you get your Realisation.

15:01.583 --> 15:05.333
But you have to be very watchful.

15:05.583 --> 15:10.333
Are you really a compassionate person?

15:12.041 --> 15:14.917
If you are compassionate,

15:15.041 --> 15:18.583
the first thing that will happen to any compassionate person,

15:18.750 --> 15:25.458
I think, will be to help others,

15:25.625 --> 15:28.375
to emancipate others.

15:28.542 --> 15:34.875
They cannot be satisfied with their own achievements

15:35.000 --> 15:44.041
and with their own state of Self Realisation.

15:44.208 --> 15:46.667
It cannot happen.

15:47.083 --> 15:53.125
What was the need for the Adi Shakti to do all, all these efforts

15:53.291 --> 15:55.000
to work so hard?

15:55.166 --> 16:00.125
You know that, that I had to work very, very hard,

16:00.291 --> 16:03.792
but, from my very childhood

16:04.417 --> 16:07.333
I've worked very hard

16:07.500 --> 16:12.792
and I've gone through very difficult times,

16:12.959 --> 16:19.834
very, very difficult times according to human understanding,

16:20.000 --> 16:26.000
but the worst time I have, when I see

16:26.125 --> 16:30.375
those people whom I have given Realisation,

16:30.542 --> 16:34.500
those who are self-realised people,

16:34.667 --> 16:42.291
they are the ones who have no responsibility for others

16:42.458 --> 16:46.333
and, if they have, it is very little.

16:46.500 --> 16:49.667
They don't have that compassion

16:49.834 --> 16:52.709
and don't have that love

16:52.875 --> 16:56.542
that we have to today save the world,

16:56.709 --> 16:58.959
save the humanity.

16:59.083 --> 17:05.333
That's our — not only our principal work,

17:05.500 --> 17:10.333
but the only work that we have to do.

17:10.500 --> 17:15.875
All other things are going to achieve nothing,

17:16.000 --> 17:21.792
except for your own efforts here,

17:21.959 --> 17:24.625
individual efforts

17:24.792 --> 17:28.083
to give Self Realisation to others

17:28.250 --> 17:32.083
and give them this knowledge.

17:32.250 --> 17:38.125
This knowledge is so, so easy to understand.

17:38.291 --> 17:41.792
It is very subtle, no doubt,

17:41.959 --> 17:44.709
and, as I've told you,

17:44.875 --> 17:51.041
that the quantum theory they're talking about now, the scientists,

17:51.208 --> 17:57.125
is that they have seen those miraculous waves of lights

17:57.291 --> 18:02.417
and they are trying to find out something about it.

18:02.583 --> 18:09.625
It cannot be that some Sahaja Yogis will rise above others.

18:09.792 --> 18:16.917
Every one of you [has] to know that this is a very special thing

18:17.041 --> 18:20.125
that has happened to you.

18:20.291 --> 18:22.875
Even if you had gone to Himalayas,

18:23.000 --> 18:25.583
even if you have starved yourself,

18:25.750 --> 18:32.041
even if you have been singing the praise of God for years,

18:32.208 --> 18:38.959
even   you had done all kinds of rituals and penances,

18:39.083 --> 18:41.917
you could not have got your Realisation.

18:42.041 --> 18:44.500
That would not have been possible.

18:44.667 --> 18:51.125
I knew this. That's why I have to work very hard,

18:51.291 --> 18:56.917
facing all kinds of problems, all kinds of turmoils,

18:57.041 --> 19:02.458
all kinds of pressures, what was the thing?

19:02.625 --> 19:09.458
Just to see that you all are created

19:09.625 --> 19:12.750
and you're all My hands.

19:12.917 --> 19:18.709
You have to work. Every finger has to work.

19:18.875 --> 19:21.709
And that is what I have been telling you,

19:21.875 --> 19:29.208
that now it is our responsibility to see that we become,

19:29.375 --> 19:36.375
not only Sahaja Yogis ourself, but blossoming time

19:36.625 --> 19:42.333
and many, many Sahaja Yogis we should have.

19:43.959 --> 19:48.625
It's a work of Adi Shakti.

19:48.792 --> 19:51.500
Try to understand this.

19:51.667 --> 19:55.458
It's not work of any saint.

19:55.625 --> 20:00.208
It's not work of any incarnation.

20:00.375 --> 20:04.250
It's not work of any politician.

20:04.417 --> 20:10.709
And not work of any big leader.

20:10.875 --> 20:14.917
It is the work of Adi Shakti,

20:15.083 --> 20:22.250
which is so transparently showing its results in you.

20:22.417 --> 20:28.291
Now it is for you to see.

20:29.792 --> 20:36.709
To please Me is your ardent desire, I know.

20:36.875 --> 20:46.375
I see how you love Me and how you want to do for Me.

20:46.542 --> 20:50.458
The greatest thing you can do for Me

20:50.625 --> 20:54.917
is to spread Sahaja Yoga.

20:55.458 --> 21:03.125
It is a very special, extremely difficult blessings you have got.

21:05.917 --> 21:09.333
You didn't have to do any efforts.

21:09.500 --> 21:13.583
You didn't have to pay any money.

21:14.375 --> 21:22.500
You don't have to get sick with rituals.

21:22.667 --> 21:26.709
You got it spontaneously.

21:27.667 --> 21:33.250
But that doesn't mean that it's sort of your birthright to get it.

21:33.417 --> 21:37.458
[It] is the work of Adi Shakti.

21:40.000 --> 21:49.709
And the work of Adi Shakti has to be shown in your life.

21:51.458 --> 21:59.750
[It] is the compassion, without any reward.

22:00.500 --> 22:03.834
People have tried to spread their religion

22:04.000 --> 22:07.667
by showing compassion to poor people,

22:07.834 --> 22:12.792
looking after the poor people, handicapped people.

22:13.875 --> 22:20.375
There's no need, actually, for Sahaja Yogis to do that.

22:21.500 --> 22:26.709
What they have to do is to transform other people.

22:27.000 --> 22:32.125
Find out ways and methods how you can transform,

22:32.458 --> 22:37.083
how you can spread the message of Adi Shakti.

22:37.458 --> 22:39.750
Put your mind to it

22:39.917 --> 22:44.417
and you will know how you can manage it.

22:47.917 --> 22:55.000
There should be all the time compelling desire

22:55.125 --> 22:58.000
that we have to find out method

22:58.125 --> 23:01.959
by which we can spread Sahaja Yoga.

23:02.875 --> 23:09.125
Otherwise it's like what Christ has described

23:09.291 --> 23:16.250
that some seed fell on the marshy land

23:16.834 --> 23:22.750
and they sprouted, but never grew.

23:23.041 --> 23:30.166
You can only grow in the real sense of the word

23:30.834 --> 23:37.083
and become something very, very special and real

23:38.041 --> 23:44.041
by knowing what you can do.

23:45.291 --> 23:48.291
I have a vision, no doubt,

23:48.458 --> 23:52.667
and I've been talking about it quite a lot,

23:52.959 --> 23:59.291
but it ends up with the puja is not a good thing.

24:00.083 --> 24:04.333
I know some countries are very difficult.

24:04.500 --> 24:08.583
Try to find out what is the problem,

24:08.750 --> 24:13.709
why it is so very difficult.

24:14.709 --> 24:19.959
Attention has to be paid to this,

24:20.083 --> 24:27.709
that what other human beings are doing to destroy themselves,

24:29.125 --> 24:32.375
as if it is the part and parcel of the same game

24:32.542 --> 24:37.291
which we call as the last judgement,

24:37.458 --> 24:41.125
but let us, through our compassion and love,

24:41.291 --> 24:44.250
save as many as possible.

24:45.792 --> 24:49.792
This is the work of Adi Shakti,

24:50.333 --> 24:55.166
not the work of any saint or any incarnation.

24:55.333 --> 24:57.959
They're all there, no doubt.

24:58.083 --> 25:03.000
They're all with us, all the time to help us,

25:03.166 --> 25:07.792
but you people have the power of Adi Shakti,

25:08.166 --> 25:11.625
which is very great,

25:11.792 --> 25:15.583
which is very penetrating,

25:15.750 --> 25:18.792
which is miraculous.

25:18.959 --> 25:22.208
It's so effective,

25:22.375 --> 25:28.333
but unless and until you become aware of your own powers,

25:28.500 --> 25:31.500
how will you work it out.

25:31.667 --> 25:37.041
It would be like a dead machine that has everything,

25:37.208 --> 25:41.417
but nobody is there to work it out.

25:41.625 --> 25:48.458
All the time I had to go through very,

25:48.625 --> 25:51.542
very hazardous times

25:51.709 --> 25:58.458
and sometimes I felt that I may have to take another birth,

25:58.625 --> 26:02.542
the way things are so difficult for Me.

26:02.709 --> 26:09.166
But now, for you, it has been very easy,

26:10.083 --> 26:15.291
as if the one who makes the road has to work very hard,

26:15.458 --> 26:17.917
but those who walk on that,

26:18.041 --> 26:23.208
they don't realise how easily they have got it.

26:23.375 --> 26:29.667
And if they realise this, then they will realise also

26:29.834 --> 26:32.834
'Let many walk on this road,

26:33.000 --> 26:35.500
which was created with such

26:35.667 --> 26:39.792
patience, understanding and love.'

26:39.959 --> 26:46.542
I have to really see you all Sahaja Yogis

26:46.709 --> 26:52.166
doing your level best to change this world

26:52.333 --> 26:54.333
— has to be changed.

26:54.500 --> 26:58.250
As it is, humanity has to be saved

26:58.417 --> 27:02.125
through you and nobody else.

27:02.875 --> 27:06.917
No president, no prime minister,

27:07.041 --> 27:09.333
no minister,

27:09.500 --> 27:13.291
none of these people can change the world

27:13.458 --> 27:15.208
and save it.

27:15.375 --> 27:18.291
It is you who are entitled.

27:18.458 --> 27:20.917
You have got this power.

27:21.083 --> 27:27.875
Do you realise your own status?

27:28.000 --> 27:32.667
Your own being?

27:32.834 --> 27:36.375
which has risen so high?

27:36.542 --> 27:42.417
It is not there. If that realisation is there,

27:42.583 --> 27:46.417
you would go all out

27:47.000 --> 27:53.542
to express your love and compassion to other people,

27:53.709 --> 27:58.959
to make them realise what they are.

27:59.083 --> 28:02.166
Only with Sahaja Yoga you can save this world.

28:02.333 --> 28:04.625
There's no other way out.

28:04.792 --> 28:11.500
Whatever you may try, say, to help the poor, to help this and that

28:11.667 --> 28:16.083
is something very, very superficial.

28:16.792 --> 28:24.375
Best thing is to give Realisation to every person you see.

28:26.000 --> 28:29.959
We have seen children. They're coming up.

28:30.083 --> 28:34.792
They'll be great Sahaja Yogis also. I can see that.

28:34.959 --> 28:41.000
But before them, you have to show your own merits

28:41.166 --> 28:44.041
of what you have done.

28:44.208 --> 28:47.125
It's not a static work.

28:47.291 --> 28:53.709
It's a big movement, which has to be really explosive

28:53.875 --> 29:03.208
and unless and until such a great step is taken,

29:07.625 --> 29:16.208
I don't know who will be blamed for the doomsday.

29:18.125 --> 29:23.583
You are the one[s] who have to build up

29:23.750 --> 29:27.333
the destiny of human beings.

29:27.500 --> 29:32.208
Don't consider as yourself, as something nothing.

29:32.375 --> 29:34.875
You could never have got your Realisation.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.083
You'd never have come to Me.

29:37.250 --> 29:41.583
Among so many, you are the ones who came to Me

29:41.750 --> 29:45.875
and who asked for Realisation and got it.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.959
You know it cannot be forced.

29:49.083 --> 29:52.750
This Realisation cannot be forced.

29:52.917 --> 29:56.041
This awareness cannot be forced.

29:56.208 --> 30:03.250
And the growthof this awareness also cannot be forced.

30:03.417 --> 30:09.834
You have to develop that attention deep down within yourself.

30:10.000 --> 30:14.417
And see for yourself what you have done,

30:14.583 --> 30:16.750
what you have done.

30:16.917 --> 30:23.125
If you are still busy with the money problem or the power problem

30:23.291 --> 30:27.709
and this problem and that, you are a problem.

30:27.875 --> 30:30.250
You are not a Sahaja Yogi.

30:30.417 --> 30:34.458
Sahaja Yogi is above everything else

30:34.625 --> 30:38.208
and is very powerful.

30:38.375 --> 30:42.959
Power will be achieved by them

30:43.083 --> 30:45.792
— power of love and compassion,

30:45.959 --> 30:50.166
which is not only words of love.

30:50.333 --> 30:55.959
It is not only act of loving others,

30:56.583 --> 31:05.291
but it is a powerful personality that you will have,

31:05.458 --> 31:08.917
which will just emit

31:09.041 --> 31:19.375
that great Divine Light and can capture people.

31:20.125 --> 31:31.000
All should just take a very brave personality.

31:32.375 --> 31:35.083
I must say people have improved,

31:35.250 --> 31:38.375
otherwise everybody used to write to Me:

31:38.542 --> 31:42.709
'This is wrong with me and that is wrong with my father.

31:42.875 --> 31:47.250
That is wrong with my great-grandmother' and all kinds of things.

31:47.417 --> 31:53.041
That is over now. Much less, I must say, much less.

31:53.792 --> 32:00.917
But instead of telling Me about people who are sick,

32:01.041 --> 32:04.417
people who have failed,

32:04.583 --> 32:12.375
people who are still in a state

32:13.000 --> 32:19.667
that cannot be improved, attention should be changed.

32:19.834 --> 32:25.959
If there's one person who has got cancer anywhere,

32:26.250 --> 32:30.166
immediately at least ten photographs will come to Me.

32:30.333 --> 32:33.792
Leader will write to Me. The wife's leader will write to Me.

32:33.959 --> 32:39.875
Everybody will write to Me that Mother, say such-and-such thing.

32:42.208 --> 32:48.500
Why? Is that My job?

32:48.667 --> 32:52.875
That person can be cured — we have hospitals —

32:53.000 --> 32:56.291
can be cured by photographs,

32:56.458 --> 33:01.625
but attention always goes now to compassion part.

33:01.792 --> 33:07.166
To those people who are so-called suffering physically,

33:07.333 --> 33:11.959
mentally, emotionally, financially,

33:12.125 --> 33:15.000
also in the marriages,

33:18.000 --> 33:21.000
that's not your job,

33:21.166 --> 33:24.000
neither Mine.

33:24.125 --> 33:28.291
If they're sick, they should take a photograph and work it out.

33:28.458 --> 33:32.917
If it doesn't work, that means that it doesn't deserve.

33:35.500 --> 33:42.750
There is no need for you to treat them and to work it out and,

33:42.917 --> 33:45.792
if it fails, to write to Me

33:45.959 --> 33:49.375
that 'Mother, such-and-such person is sick.'

33:49.542 --> 33:52.417
What's so important?

33:53.208 --> 33:59.250
Already we have so many healthy people going round.

33:59.417 --> 34:01.625
Why not use them first?

34:01.792 --> 34:05.959
Our job is not to cure people.

34:06.125 --> 34:11.000
Affection is all right. Compassion is all right. Is a natural thing

34:11.125 --> 34:17.875
that our attention goes to sick people or to the poor people

34:18.000 --> 34:22.500
or to the people who are suffering,

34:22.667 --> 34:27.959
but what about Sahaj Yog?

34:31.291 --> 34:34.583
If you have one sick person,

34:34.750 --> 34:38.875
hundred Sahaja Yogis will get after that.

34:39.000 --> 34:42.250
What is the reason?

34:42.417 --> 34:46.333
Is it compassion?

34:46.500 --> 34:48.709
It's not.

34:50.417 --> 34:57.000
They want to prove that they can cure that person.

34:57.959 --> 35:00.875
Is not compassion.

35:01.000 --> 35:04.291
Compassion today is

35:04.458 --> 35:10.834
to transform human beings into Sahajis,

35:11.208 --> 35:14.625
into good people.

35:14.792 --> 35:18.875
That is the love of Adi Shakti.

35:19.333 --> 35:23.083
Because those who are born have to die in any case.

35:23.250 --> 35:27.417
We should not be unkind, of course, but

35:27.583 --> 35:33.917
our attention should be how many people we are giving Realisation.

35:34.333 --> 35:37.291
Is a very common thing

35:37.458 --> 35:43.041
that people indulge more into so-called curing

35:43.208 --> 35:48.792
and improving and this. It's all right.

35:49.125 --> 35:54.333
Also there are problems like in the marriages, you see.

35:54.500 --> 35:57.792
Some marriage couple don't want to be there.

35:57.959 --> 36:01.375
It's all right. Finish them.

36:02.333 --> 36:06.500
If they don't want to live together, let them.

36:07.208 --> 36:10.959
We have many people who are sensible in this world,

36:11.083 --> 36:14.917
many people who are healthy in this world.

36:15.583 --> 36:18.417
Now how can you go on struggling with people

36:18.583 --> 36:22.458
who don't want to live together and have problems?

36:23.166 --> 36:25.750
That's not your job.

36:25.917 --> 36:29.000
First of all, you are a spiritual worker.

36:29.125 --> 36:32.291
You are not a social worker.

36:32.458 --> 36:34.000
Of course,

36:34.166 --> 36:39.542
by the way, you can do social work. It doesn't matter, by the way.

36:41.250 --> 36:47.291
But the main thing for you is to transform human beings.

36:48.000 --> 36:52.750
With that, the greatest disease

36:52.917 --> 36:58.583
is of meanness, of cruelty,

37:01.083 --> 37:06.709
of torturing others, anger.

37:07.667 --> 37:11.375
All these diseases can be cured,

37:11.542 --> 37:15.583
which are internal, not external.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.291
That is today wanted.

37:18.458 --> 37:22.458
Every country's fighting and is tortured

37:22.625 --> 37:29.792
and is in peril all the time of getting destroyed.

37:30.750 --> 37:36.041
The only way you can do it is to give them Realisation.

37:36.208 --> 37:40.834
Now what happens is to be seen very clearly

37:41.625 --> 37:47.041
that when you give Realisation to someone

37:47.208 --> 37:52.750
and he values it, and he grows into it,

37:52.959 --> 37:57.417
then you are protected.

37:57.583 --> 38:01.417
You are completely protected.

38:02.000 --> 38:05.792
Who protects you, you may say?

38:05.959 --> 38:08.875
The Adi Shakti, all right,

38:09.000 --> 38:16.667
but also there is a destructive power working in this world,

38:16.834 --> 38:23.500
not of negativity, but positive destructive power of Shiva.

38:24.041 --> 38:35.583
If He says that if Adi Shakti's work is going on well, He's happy.

38:35.875 --> 38:39.625
But He's sitting there and watching each and every person,

38:39.792 --> 38:43.458
each and every work of Sahaja Yogis

38:43.625 --> 38:51.959
and if He finds something really very wrong,

38:52.125 --> 38:55.709
I cannot control it.

38:55.959 --> 39:02.458
He destroys. I cannot go to that point.

39:03.250 --> 39:06.250
He destroys.

39:06.417 --> 39:14.125
Not only destroys, but thousands He can destroy.

39:17.917 --> 39:21.750
Anywhere there is a calamity,

39:21.917 --> 39:28.917
we can say, like an earthquake

39:29.041 --> 39:33.583
or some sort of a hurricane,

39:33.750 --> 39:35.583
all these things come

39:35.750 --> 39:43.625
through the working of Shri Mahadeva.

39:44.875 --> 39:48.208
I can't help you there,

39:48.667 --> 39:54.041
but if you really give Realisation to people,

39:55.792 --> 39:59.417
all these can be averted.

40:00.333 --> 40:06.375
Of course, it is the whim, I should say, of Adi Shakti

40:06.542 --> 40:10.959
that She started this work of creating this world,

40:11.083 --> 40:16.250
of creating you and making you Sahaja Yogis,

40:16.458 --> 40:20.792
but your responsibility is also very important.

40:24.000 --> 40:27.667
You cannot be responsible.

40:30.500 --> 40:40.375
Maybe it was, I felt, My responsibility, but there's a difference.

40:42.125 --> 40:46.583
I never felt it was My responsibility,

40:47.667 --> 40:51.542
never felt this was My job,

40:51.709 --> 40:54.792
never felt I have to do it.

40:54.959 --> 40:57.417
'I did it.'

41:00.792 --> 41:02.750
That is the work.

41:02.917 --> 41:07.166
That's the kind of personality you should have.

41:07.333 --> 41:13.208
You have to do it in a very humble manner,

41:15.333 --> 41:19.875
in a very beautiful manner

41:20.000 --> 41:25.166
and you'll be amazed to see how you are protected,

41:25.333 --> 41:31.875
how you are supported and how everything works out.

41:32.125 --> 41:35.750
The greatest joy you will get when you will find

41:35.917 --> 41:39.000
you can give Realisation to people.

41:40.667 --> 41:44.208
You can change their lives.

41:44.917 --> 41:47.208
Never you would feel such joy,

41:47.375 --> 41:55.333
even if you get, say, a big lottery maybe,

41:55.875 --> 41:59.792
a big job or a big name

41:59.959 --> 42:06.375
or a very big award, no.

42:07.333 --> 42:12.542
The joy of creating Sahaja Yogis

42:13.375 --> 42:18.208
knows no bounds,

42:18.834 --> 42:22.709
is such a joy-giving thing.

42:23.792 --> 42:28.792
You develop such fraternities,

42:28.959 --> 42:35.000
such solidarity, as they call it, such oneness,

42:35.375 --> 42:40.208
such enjoyment of love,

42:40.667 --> 42:43.875
enjoyment of compassion.

42:44.000 --> 42:47.834
It's a different level of enjoyment

42:48.000 --> 42:52.041
that's not like ordinary enjoyments.

42:54.375 --> 42:57.792
You're not to be afraid of Me,

42:57.959 --> 43:02.166
but be afraid of yourself.

43:02.333 --> 43:06.041
Have a watch on yourself and see for yourself

43:06.208 --> 43:09.792
what have you been doing so far.

43:09.959 --> 43:13.166
What have you done so far?

43:13.333 --> 43:19.667
Because you have been enlightened.

43:20.417 --> 43:23.375
If the enlightened people

43:23.542 --> 43:27.375
cannot give light, what's the use in having them?

43:27.542 --> 43:30.291
Look at these little, little candles.

43:30.458 --> 43:36.208
Whatever little light they have, they're giving that light.

43:36.375 --> 43:40.333
They're burning themselves to give that light.

43:40.500 --> 43:46.583
If we cannot give that light,

43:47.875 --> 43:52.125
what is the use of enlightenment?

43:53.291 --> 43:58.000
Enlightened doesn't mean the light for yourself only

43:58.166 --> 44:03.041
the light of love, compassion,

44:03.208 --> 44:09.959
which is divine, which is not normal, which is not ordinary,

44:10.083 --> 44:12.875
as you see in the films.

44:13.000 --> 44:18.375
It is a divine love which works

44:19.583 --> 44:24.625
and that is what makes Me sometimes little weak

44:24.792 --> 44:28.166
when I hear that Sahaja Yogis now

44:28.333 --> 44:32.917
are getting involved in money, in cheating.

44:33.041 --> 44:37.625
I mean, all kinds of criminal activities they do.

44:37.792 --> 44:41.542
I can't understand. I can't believe it.

44:41.709 --> 44:45.667
After getting the highest,

44:45.834 --> 44:51.667
why do you want to go so low as that?

44:51.834 --> 44:57.500
Because you have not yet felt what you have got.

44:59.041 --> 45:03.291
You have not realised what you have got.

45:05.500 --> 45:09.166
And you don't respect yourself.

45:09.583 --> 45:16.542
Still, if you are on the same line and the same level,

45:16.709 --> 45:27.417
I must say you have done no justice to Me or to yourself.

45:27.959 --> 45:31.500
We have to work it out.

45:31.667 --> 45:35.125
Single-handed, I've done it,

45:35.291 --> 45:38.917
worked very hard, I must say,

45:39.041 --> 45:46.208
in the sense that I had to deal with horrible people,

45:47.750 --> 45:54.959
very unkind, very selfish, very cruel.

45:55.709 --> 45:58.667
That doesn't matter.

46:01.041 --> 46:05.083
And such beautiful birds I have discovered.

46:05.750 --> 46:10.417
But you must keep your lustre

46:10.583 --> 46:13.458
and work it out.

46:13.625 --> 46:20.500
I'll be very happy to know that Sahaja Yoga is spreading

46:20.667 --> 46:25.291
with leaps and bounds, with great speed

46:25.458 --> 46:29.166
and that people are really

46:29.333 --> 46:37.250
getting into that realm

46:37.792 --> 46:44.709
of peace, joy and happiness.

46:44.875 --> 46:47.667
That's My dream

46:47.834 --> 46:51.792
and I hope you all will all work it out.

46:52.208 --> 46:54.917
Thank you very much.
