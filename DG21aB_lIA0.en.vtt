00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:13.654
But when the brain becomes the Spirit, 
the Spirit is the doer,

00:00:15.156 --> 00:00:19.480
and when Spirit is the doer,

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.924
then you become

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:32.062
a complete Shiva - self-realized.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.969
In that state, if you get angry,

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.052
you are not attached.

00:00:44.413 --> 00:00:49.178
You are not an attached person to anything whatsoever.

00:00:50.237 --> 00:00:53.072
If you possess anything, you are not attached.

00:00:53.152 --> 00:00:57.413
You cannot attach because Spirit is detachment,

00:00:57.493 --> 00:01:00.133
is complete detachment.

00:01:00.443 --> 00:01:06.630
You don't bother about any attachments whatsoever.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.829
Even for a second, you are not attached.

00:01:15.023 --> 00:01:21.484
Now, I would say, to understand the detachment of Spirit,

00:01:21.564 --> 00:01:26.644
we should study ourselves very well, clearly:

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:29.899
“How are we attached?”.

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:35.485
We are attached, firstly, by our brain,

00:01:35.565 --> 00:01:42.479
mostly by our brain because all our 
conditionings are in our brain,

00:01:42.559 --> 00:01:47.517
and all our ego is also in our brain.

00:01:51.067 --> 00:01:57.955
So all emotional attachments are through our brain,

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:04.474
and all our egoistical attachments, 
also, are through our brain.

00:02:06.238 --> 00:02:10.912
That's why it is said that after Realization 
one must try to practice

00:02:10.992 --> 00:02:16.901
the Shiva Tattwa by practicing detachment.

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:19.960
Please, give Me the shawl.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.643
It’s so cold because of Shri Shiva.

00:02:23.723 --> 00:02:29.160
Now how do you practice this detachment?

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:35.739
All of you can understand English a little bit, isn’t it?

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.002
Because we get attached to something, 
of course, through our brain,

00:02:39.082 --> 00:02:41.917
but through our attention.

00:02:41.997 --> 00:02:49.005
So we try to do what we call Chitta Nirodh,

00:02:49.085 --> 00:02:52.935
is to control your attention: where is it going?

00:02:53.015 --> 00:02:58.019
In the practice of Sahaja Yoga, if you have to rise higher,

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:02.743
you have to improve your own instrument, 
and not the instrument of others.

00:03:02.823 --> 00:03:07.272
This is one thing one should know, for definite.

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:13.135
Now, you just watch your attention, 
where is it going. Watch yourself.

00:03:13.215 --> 00:03:17.964
As soon as you’ll start watching yourself, 
your attention, you’ll become

00:03:18.044 --> 00:03:21.676
more identified with your Spirit. 
Because if you have to watch your attention,

00:03:21.757 --> 00:03:26.032
you have to be your Spirit, otherwise how will you watch it?

00:03:26.321 --> 00:03:30.269
So, now, see where is your attention going.

00:03:31.726 --> 00:03:39.692
First, the attachment is, in all gross ways, to your body.

00:03:41.091 --> 00:03:47.496
So we see Shiva – He has no attachment to His body.

00:03:49.225 --> 00:03:51.982
He sleeps anywhere.

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:58.609
He goes to the cemeteries and He sleeps 
there because He’s not attached.

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:02.781
He can never be caught up by any bhoots 
or anything, nothing of the kind.

00:04:02.861 --> 00:04:05.784
See, He is detached.

00:04:13.254 --> 00:04:22.505
The detachment is to be watched and 
seen through your own attachments.

00:04:25.151 --> 00:04:28.492
Now, because you are realized souls,

00:04:28.572 --> 00:04:31.747
not yet the Spirit, has not come into your brain, of course,

00:04:31.827 --> 00:04:36.123
but still you are realized souls. So what you can do

00:04:36.203 --> 00:04:41.787
is at least to watch your attention, you can do that.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:49.151
You can watch your attention very clearly

00:04:50.596 --> 00:04:55.639
by seeing where your attention is going.

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:02.550
And then, controlling your attention, also, you can do.

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.173
Very simple:

00:05:07.774 --> 00:05:11.159
to control your attention

00:05:11.428 --> 00:05:17.799
you have to just remove your attention from this to that.

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:21.617
Try to change your priorities.

00:05:22.371 --> 00:05:27.558
All this has to be done now, after Realization
 - a complete detachment.

00:05:27.638 --> 00:05:31.492
So the body demands comfort,

00:05:31.572 --> 00:05:36.733
try to make body uncomfortable a little bit. Try.

00:05:36.813 --> 00:05:41.166
What you think it to be comfortable,

00:05:41.246 --> 00:05:45.734
try to make it little uncomfortable. 
That's why people went to Himalayas.

00:05:45.814 --> 00:05:49.909
You see, coming to this place itself 
has caused us lot of problems.

00:05:49.989 --> 00:05:53.807
But going to Himalayas - you can imagine.

00:05:54.595 --> 00:05:58.373
So after Realization, they used to take 
their body to Himalayas, "All right,

00:05:58.453 --> 00:06:02.559
go through all this. Let's see how you act."

00:06:02.964 --> 00:06:07.471
So what you call the penance side starts now in a way.

00:06:07.551 --> 00:06:11.736
it's a penance which you can do very easily 
because now you are realized souls.

00:06:11.816 --> 00:06:17.661
With enjoyment, little, try to make this body...

00:06:19.927 --> 00:06:24.597
For Shiva, it doesn't matter whether He is in a cemetery

00:06:24.677 --> 00:06:30.955
or in His own Kailasha or anywhere.

00:06:35.239 --> 00:06:39.146
Where is your attention is, you see.

00:06:40.619 --> 00:06:48.762
That your human attention is hopelessly bad. 
Very entangled nonsense it is.

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:55.319
"We did this because of this." There is an explanation.

00:06:55.399 --> 00:06:59.756
Or others have to give an explanation. 
No explanation is needed

00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:05.267
to be given, or to be accepted, 
or to be asked for. No explanation.

00:07:05.347 --> 00:07:10.674
To exist without explanation is the best way.

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:20.101
In a simple Hindi language, "Jaise rakhahu taise hi rahu".

00:07:20.181 --> 00:07:24.654
"Whichever way you keep me I'll remain in that state,

00:07:24.734 --> 00:07:28.733
and I’ll enjoy."

00:07:28.813 --> 00:07:33.088
Further in this poem, Kabira says,

00:07:33.168 --> 00:07:36.116
"If you make me go on an elephant”

00:07:36.196 --> 00:07:43.766
- means the royal conveyance - “I'll go. 
If you make me walk, I'll walk."

00:07:44.352 --> 00:07:48.854
"Jaise rakhahu taise hi rahu". So no reaction on that point,

00:07:48.934 --> 00:07:54.217
no reaction. First no explanation, no reaction.
