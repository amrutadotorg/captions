00:10:27.950 --> 00:12:06.530
Today 

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:18.560
we have decided to have Krishna Puja because
America is the Krishna bhoomi.

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:29.700
It's very surprising that such a great incarnation
of Shri Krishna came even much later than

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:39.410
Rama and has sent His special people to live
in America.

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:47.720
Of course, there are many who are seeking
in this country, no doubt.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:52.650
But there are many who are also misleading
them.

00:12:52.650 --> 00:13:06.760
That's how you find, despite all our effort,
we have not been able to expand Sahaja Yoga

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:10.640
very much.

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:14.321
What one has to learn from His life is very,
very important.

00:13:14.321 --> 00:13:23.040
The first and foremost thing He taught was
collectivity.

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:39.790
He used to get hold of small boys and play
with them together.

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:43.010
Rama didn't do that.

00:13:43.010 --> 00:14:00.581
He used to get hold of ladies who were selling
milk and also butter, those who used to go

00:14:00.581 --> 00:14:08.350
to fill their water in the pitcher.

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:20.030
He is the one who collected all such people
in the village of Gokul.

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:37.140
He played all kinds of pranks on His friends
and His mother and the mother's friends.

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:51.230
Behaved just like a very naughty child, just
to show that He was just like all of us.

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:56.580
As you know, He was the incarnation of Shri
Vishnu.

00:14:56.580 --> 00:15:14.230
First Shri Rama was born, took incarnation
as Shri Rama, which was in the Aryan race,

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:27.320
means that time we had an Aryan race which
was sort of superior, superior race than others.

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:39.120
But when He came as Krishna, He took His birth
in Yadav dynasty, you can call it.

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:56.490
They were not superior, they were selling
milk, having cowherds and doing work not of

00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:58.710
any religious style.

00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:11.520
But they were innocent simple people living
in the villages, and they saw the great miracles

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:14.380
of Shri Krishna's childhood.

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:17.420
He killed demons.

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:20.460
He killed Pootna.

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:22.490
All these people were sent by His uncle Kamsa
to kill him.

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:34.330
It was 
to be, because He had to prove that He was

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:37.670
the incarnation of Shri Vishnu and He did
it.

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:45.260
As a child, how He killed those people is
remarkable.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:54.610
And how He made them out though they were
all camouflaged.

00:16:54.610 --> 00:17:00.060
In these modern times, difficult for people
to believe that there could have been any

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:03.610
incarnation like Shri Krishna.

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:17.170
But in Sahaja Yoga, we have method of absolutely
establishing the truth that Shri Krishna was

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:22.689
there ruling on the Vishuddhi chakra.

00:17:22.689 --> 00:17:28.240
From His childhood, you can see He was fond
of collectivity.

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:37.110
And He tried to create collectivity of people
who were very simple, uneducated, good hearted

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:39.530
people.

00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:43.550
And that is His special quality.

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:51.970
And all the people of that village knew Him
very well, all cared for Him.

00:17:51.970 --> 00:18:02.330
And when He had to go, they felt very sad
and all of them came running and crying for

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:03.330
Him.

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:06.880
It was a small boy who was going.

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:11.360
After all, what is there?

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:15.710
A little boy from the village is going.

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:25.310
The whole village had gathered to cry for
Him.

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:29.620
That is what we all Sahaja Yogis have to know.

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:35.500
As a child also, He was a very collective
personality.

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:39.230
He actually emits collectiveness.

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:46.570
The collective consciousness that you enjoy
is because of His bliss.

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:58.960
I find that Americans are very collective
in the sense, they are more bothered about

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:02.510
other countries than about their own.

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:07.510
They want to go all the way to Vietnam, now
to Iraq, now to some other place.

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:16.679
Going all over the world, (Shri Mataji laughing)
they try to correct.

00:19:16.679 --> 00:19:20.980
But their own country they do not see what's
wrong.

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:25.590
It's so divided.

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:40.830
Mainly divided on race, racial discrimination,
is divided by religions and all of these are

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:49.920
just concepts which they have accepted and
are fighting among themselves.

00:19:49.920 --> 00:20:04.920
Now after all these, there are people who
believe they are born criminals and they should

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:06.560
be criminals.

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:11.900
And their criminality is going very far.

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:14.510
They are gangsters.

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:20.250
Even small children have become gangsters.

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:27.980
But the worst part is that these little boys
also, including others, all these criminals

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:30.500
are regarded as big heroes.

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:44.850
I 
have seen once, a young boy wearing a shirt

00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:48.690
with another young boy's photograph on it.

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:50.560
So he told Me.

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:52.419
I said, "Who's this?"

00:20:52.419 --> 00:20:53.640
"You don't know?

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:57.410
Very famous gangster", he said.

00:20:57.410 --> 00:21:03.120
At the age of thirteen years he is a very
famous gangster and this boy is very proudly

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:15.550
putting up that - like a big hero, or you
can call it like a God there.

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:25.590
So see the perversion to what limit Shri Krishna's
blessings have been used.

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:29.260
That's why this country is very difficult.

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:38.010
One after another there has been attack of
negativity.

00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:46.300
For example, first thing started by Christians,
who said that Jews killed Christ.

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:49.740
It's not true, it's not true.

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:53.179
He was never killed by Jews.

00:21:53.179 --> 00:22:00.230
"Christ was killed by Jews", is a false statement,
absolutely.

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:03.290
Christ was not killed by Jews.

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:08.380
How can a multitude kill a man?

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:11.290
It's the law there.

00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:20.210
The Romans, or we can call the Roman law crucified
Him.

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:27.130
So the Christians started nicely torturing
the Jews, because Christ was killed.

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:30.910
I don't know how to explain this.

00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:33.250
Such absurd idea.

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:42.120
Now somebody was killed so many years back,
and now what's the use of killing some grandchildren

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:46.270
of those people or great grandchildren of
those people?

00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:52.120
But they did not, the Jews did not.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:58.620
Still this concept was there that the Jews
killed.

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:08.429
And the Christians felt they have a right
to torture the Jews.

00:23:08.429 --> 00:23:13.270
So when the Jews came here, they were never
given a good position, they were tortured

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:16.700
very much and troubled very much.

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:21.770
It happened everywhere but very much more
here.

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:28.809
So among Jews now came out some devils, like
Freud.

00:23:28.809 --> 00:23:30.460
And he said, "All right.

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:40.920
We must shatter these Christians absolutely.

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:44.100
Their moral roots must be finished."

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:54.100
So he started his own psychology to destroy
the Christians.

00:23:54.100 --> 00:24:00.740
And Christians stupidly accepted it.

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:10.340
They did whatever he said, experimented whatever
he did.

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:18.820
When I was once in Switzerland, two girls
came and they were shaking in the program.

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:20.169
I couldn't understand.

00:24:20.169 --> 00:24:21.530
I called them.

00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:24.240
I said, "Why are you shaking?"

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:38.210
So they said that, "Actually we are very much
degree holders in Freudian (Shri Mataji laughing)

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:41.620
knowledge and we have done all experiments
of Freud."

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:45.500
"And then why are you shaking?"

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:50.410
"Because we have power to shake!"

00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:53.090
[inaudible] (Laughter)

00:24:53.090 --> 00:25:05.370
So they followed this Freud and this vindictiveness
that was there was not seen by anyone, even

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:08.330
by Jews.

00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:19.810
As a result we had people who were deadly
against each other and ruining each other,

00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:23.630
destroying each other.

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:31.809
Then this Black and White business started.

00:25:31.809 --> 00:25:40.680
All kinds of theories people are putting up
to show that the Blacks are bad or the Whites

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:43.790
are bad.

00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:48.030
The difference is only skin deep.

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:52.620
If you want you can cut the skin and see for
yourself.

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:55.800
Inside body is the same.

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:58.630
But it was so.

00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:06.140
This divisive method started and it's still
going on.

00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:17.419
I always say, without Blacks, Americans will
be left high and dry.

00:26:17.419 --> 00:26:23.679
Look at the talent they have.

00:26:23.679 --> 00:26:24.679
Not only music.

00:26:24.679 --> 00:26:32.020
Atlanta, I saw, all the Blacks were winning
and Whites were not anywhere.

00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:40.919
(Shri Mataji laughing) Very nicely they used
to run, very swiftly at the end of it, you

00:26:40.919 --> 00:26:41.919
see.

00:26:41.919 --> 00:26:44.740
And all the Whites were saying, "Ha, ha, ha."

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:47.800
They were nicely enjoying their [BEAUTY / position
?]. (Laughter)

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:53.190
You don't have the stamina of the Blacks also.

00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:58.550
So in games also, same thing.

00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:01.900
With all this what is going to happen to America?

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:08.240
It's a country which has to be collective
because of Shri Krishna.

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.840
All of them are immigrants here.

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:13.840
Who is not an immigrant?

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:17.630
Whether they came earlier or later doesn't
matter.

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:23.470
Thank God, I have told you many a times that
Columbus lost his way and came here and not

00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:24.470
to India.

00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:29.240
Otherwise, there would have been no Indians
left and no Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:34.929
(Laughter) I think it was the trick of Hanumana.

00:27:34.929 --> 00:27:41.889
(Shri Mataji laughing) He misled him and Columbus
came here.

00:27:41.889 --> 00:27:45.379
Thank God.

00:27:45.379 --> 00:27:47.129
(Laughter)

00:27:47.129 --> 00:27:54.970
Now you are in a country where you have to
be collective.

00:27:54.970 --> 00:28:01.860
Krishna won't spare you unless and until you
are collective or you give up this nonsense

00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:05.560
of skin-deep differences.

00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:07.900
Then religious differences.

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:17.190
He had a friend who was lame by one leg.

00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:21.050
He had some friends who were very black.

00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:25.480
He had some friends who were quite Indian
white, I should say.

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:30.500
I shouldn't say white like you people, but
Indian white.

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:32.869
He had all kinds of colors.

00:28:32.869 --> 00:28:37.360
And He took His own birth in the Yadav vansh.

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:48.409
They were milk sellers, milkmen who used to
sell milk to people.

00:28:48.409 --> 00:28:54.020
He didn't take His birth in a very royal family
like Shri Rama.

00:28:54.020 --> 00:29:02.409
Though He was, because later on He became
the king of Dwarika.

00:29:02.409 --> 00:29:18.090
But in His style, in His behavior, in His
life, nobody could see that He was a royal

00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:19.630
personality.

00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:24.210
He could sleep under a tree.

00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:27.970
He could eat anything that He could get.

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:39.700
All kinds of sweet, sweet stories you can
read in His life, showing how He was enjoying

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:43.429
His collectivity, never showing off.

00:29:43.429 --> 00:29:50.870
And His collectivity has to be worked out
in this country.

00:29:50.870 --> 00:30:02.940
Unless and until it is done from your heart,
it's not going to work out.

00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:04.419
We had problems like this always with our
collectivity here.

00:30:04.419 --> 00:30:12.389
For example, a lady, you know, she is a big
lady, I think.

00:30:12.389 --> 00:30:13.800
She started correcting people.

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:14.990
"Why do you put here?

00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:16.040
This thing is getting dirty.

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:19.659
That thing is this and that."

00:30:19.659 --> 00:30:26.970
Such a woman should be sometimes sent to some
stable to clean it.

00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:31.040
Then she will give up these nonsensical ideas
that she has.

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:37.750
If you are a Sahaja Yogi you cannot behave
like this.

00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:43.200
And this kind of a behavior can destroy Sahaja
Yoga.

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:53.000
Have you ever heard Me saying that, "This
is dirty, this is not good, I don't like this?"

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.960
Did I say, ever?

00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:03.290
First of all, we have to understand, if we
have to be collective, we should give up these

00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:11.750
stupid ideas about ourselves.

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:21.990
Some people get some position, may be some
money, maybe, I would say, have a background.

00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:29.790
If you are sticking on to it then you are
not a Sahaja Yogi.

00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:32.070
You are saints.

00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:35.630
You cannot be demanding.

00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:39.620
You have to give, and give, and give.

00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:51.190
Whatever may be your position in life, if
that can overpower you then you are not a

00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:55.410
Sahaja Yogi at all.

00:31:55.410 --> 00:32:08.520
Shri Krishna, who is the Virat, who is the
great primordial personality, didn't show

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:13.200
any such signs of His greatness.

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:23.159
But Americans have a specialty to show that
they are something outstandingly great.

00:32:23.159 --> 00:32:29.950
But Sahaja Yogis, please don't learn those
things.

00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:37.540
You have to make others unlearn.

00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:48.290
If that cannot happen, it's better to leave
Sahaja Yoga for ever.

00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:56.350
Such people will make everyone miserable and
destroy Sahaja Yoga in America.

00:32:56.350 --> 00:33:05.179
Even about protocol, you should become timeless.

00:33:05.179 --> 00:33:08.080
Absolutely timeless.

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:17.070
Now, if you are particular about time, Shri
Krishna will play His tricks and your timing

00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:20.730
will be finished.

00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:23.169
Happened yesterday.

00:33:23.169 --> 00:33:25.609
(Laughter &amp; applause)

00:33:25.609 --> 00:33:39.919
So one has to know that time is your slave
and you don't have to be the slave of time

00:33:39.919 --> 00:33:41.159
- if you are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:33:41.159 --> 00:33:43.530
Otherwise, you are not.

00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:49.109
That means you are guided not by the Divine.

00:33:49.109 --> 00:33:52.260
The Divine works out everything very well.

00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:54.080
But for whom?

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:55.080
For Sahaja Yogis.

00:33:55.080 --> 00:34:03.879
But if you are not Sahaja Yogis, you'll topple
down.

00:34:03.879 --> 00:34:12.730
In every way you should find out what things
we have accumulated among ourselves, which

00:34:12.730 --> 00:34:16.859
is not Shri Krishna's quality.

00:34:16.859 --> 00:34:25.860
Now, Shri Krishna used to steal as a child,
the butter from the ladies.

00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:26.860
Why?

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:31.119
Why did He steal the butter?

00:34:31.119 --> 00:34:44.800
Because they were selling it to the military
of Kamsa, His uncle, who was a devil.

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:49.310
They used to go all the way to sell him in
Mathura.

00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:55.000
So He used to steal it, because children needed
it, and giving it to children.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:10.440
He didn't like this idea - why should it go
to these horrible rakshasas of Mathura?

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:11.440
Just the opposite in is America.

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:22.780
All the false gurus, all the rakshasas come
here and they get all the butter.

00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:41.590
As if people have no brains to understand,
while Shri Krishna is the brain of the Virat.

00:35:41.590 --> 00:35:44.580
But here you find that people have no brains.

00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:50.609
Anybody comes, says something, "Ah, ha, ha,
great."

00:35:50.609 --> 00:35:52.110
Somebody talks big - all right.

00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:54.210
They will give away their money.

00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:56.310
They will give away their houses.

00:35:56.310 --> 00:36:03.040
Their children they'll remove from the school
- for something extremely stupid.

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:13.359
While He is the brain in the body of Virata.

00:36:13.359 --> 00:36:19.650
So this kind of brainlessness comes and we
really start, even Sahaja Yogis start behaving

00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:20.700
in a manner that shows they are really brainless.

00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:23.200
Apart from that, He is Kubera.

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:30.360
He is the God of wealth.

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:39.880
That's why there is wealth in this country.

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:50.050
But this wealth is all becoming debts, you
see, because of the special brains of Americans.

00:36:50.050 --> 00:36:59.550
They are so stupid that whatever is selling
in the market, whether they need it or not,

00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:00.700
they'll buy.

00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:07.620
Take loan, again take loan, take loan till
they are absolutely indebted.

00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:14.359
Now here in the country of Kubera you should
be really rich.

00:37:14.359 --> 00:37:22.210
Rich doesn't mean just to have bank balance,
but means by temperament.

00:37:22.210 --> 00:37:35.240
Now it's much better but once upon a time,
Americans were the most miserly Sahaja Yogis.

00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:40.680
They used to send Me candles as present and
I used to hide that.

00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:46.500
I said, "Baba why do you send candles, even?

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:52.030
Don't send anything, because everybody is
going to see those candles and what are they

00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:59.090
going to say about it, that candles have been
sent."

00:37:59.090 --> 00:38:03.980
Now, this I am talking for introspection.

00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:06.080
Are we collective?

00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:12.720
Are we willing to share everything that we
have?

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:20.680
Do we look down upon people who come from
other countries?

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:23.940
Do we have racialism in us?

00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:31.970
Thirty five Sahaja Yogis came from Australia,
to America as if this is some Haj.

00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:36.500
They went back with very bad vibrations.

00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:40.640
Out of them half were thrown out of Sahaja
Yoga.

00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:49.970
Imagine Australia is a country where they
used to send all the criminals.

00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:57.600
So first and foremost, to judge yourself is
to see your vibrations.

00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:06.170
That you should meditate and judge your vibrations
if you are really collective or not.

00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:12.970
Because you are not like that, Sahaja Yoga
does not spread.

00:39:12.970 --> 00:39:21.420
I have seen people from Hare Rama Hare Krishna.

00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:25.150
Poor things have found nothing.

00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:34.170
They get up at four o'clock, start their Hare
Rama Hare Krishna bhajan - four o'clock.

00:39:34.170 --> 00:39:39.369
Then the whole day they wear a very thin dhoti
in which they are shivering.

00:39:39.369 --> 00:39:50.210
They shave their heads and put a pig's tail
here which is bought in the market.

00:39:50.210 --> 00:39:55.300
If you see their dedication you'll be surprised.

00:39:55.300 --> 00:40:04.260
How they are so much dedicated, when they
haven't found anything whatsoever?

00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:05.390
What about the nuns?

00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:09.430
You see them, you will be amazed.

00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:14.060
One fellow came from the Catholic Church to
us.

00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:17.980
He was trying to be a priest.

00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:23.230
He said, "Mother, Sahaja Yog - you don't do
anything."

00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:27.890
I said, "What do you want to do?"

00:40:27.890 --> 00:40:33.190
"No, there we could not eat any meat on Fridays.

00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:37.320
On Saturdays, we could not drink anything.

00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:44.320
Then on Sundays, the whole day we had to fast
and pray to God."

00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:47.820
"Then - what about the rest of the time?"

00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:55.730
"The rest of the time, we had to remember
Bible by heart and then recite it.

00:40:55.730 --> 00:41:05.550
And if we made even one mistake, the Father
would give us a nice beating."

00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:13.010
That's another problem with Sahaja Yoga because
it is Shri Krishna's play.

00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:15.640
It's so simple.

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:22.500
You don't have to do anything of the kind.

00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:23.500
No disciplining, nothing.

00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:27.230
Left to you, you are your own master.

00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:31.480
You are your own guru.

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:36.970
But these things which are lingering in your
mind, which was just the opposite of Shri

00:41:36.970 --> 00:41:46.550
Krishna's life, which you have acquired in
this country, are still there, here and there,

00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:49.240
here and there left.

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:56.010
Some of the people are really still so much
busy with themselves.

00:41:56.010 --> 00:42:07.380
They look so pale, thin - I tell you, I can't
believe they are Sahaja Yogis.

00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:10.520
So when we see Shri Krishna's life, the way
He lived.

00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:16.380
And then He went to help the Pandavas.

00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:22.980
He told Arjuna that, "I can be your charioteer.

00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:27.460
I can drive your chariot.

00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:31.350
But I will not fight."

00:42:31.350 --> 00:42:40.099
Arjuna knew that He was all powerful, if He
is there everything will work out.

00:42:40.099 --> 00:42:45.630
"And all My army, I'll give to Kauravas, to
see the balance."

00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:50.130
He said, "All right."

00:42:50.130 --> 00:42:55.490
He didn't fight to show off, I am this, I
am that.

00:42:55.490 --> 00:42:59.599
Like here, "Mother, I am the leader.

00:42:59.599 --> 00:43:07.130
(Laughter) I am the leader."

00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:10.290
"Can't hear, I can't hear."

00:43:10.290 --> 00:43:11.910
(Laughter) "Mother, I am this."

00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:16.120
You are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:22.630
It's a very great name that you have achieved.

00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:27.000
The highest position you have achieved.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:32.220
There's nothing more to be achieved.

00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:34.620
Like somebody asked Me, "Mother, the Indians
in India never catch.

00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:37.650
Why do we go on catching all the time?"

00:43:37.650 --> 00:43:41.690
I said, "Because Indians in India know they
have achieved it now.

00:43:41.690 --> 00:43:44.830
Nothing to be achieved.

00:43:44.830 --> 00:43:49.840
You want to have God's Realization - I don't
know what other Realization."

00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:52.190
They don't think like that.

00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:54.230
They say, "We have achieved now.

00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:55.230
We are in the sea.

00:43:55.230 --> 00:44:03.369
It's for us to swim over."

00:44:03.369 --> 00:44:11.040
All these things some of you have crossed
over, some of you have absolutely lost them.

00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:12.680
But some of you are still there.

00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:25.060
They are the most dangerous thing as Christ
has said, "Be careful of the murmuring souls."

00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:32.900
I don't know how to stop this little rat-like
people, who are cutting the nest of Sahaja

00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:34.960
Yoga.

00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:42.630
I've been reported about many and I am really
shocked.

00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:53.609
After so many years of My visit how can people
talk ill of each other and can create these

00:44:53.609 --> 00:44:54.819
problems?

00:44:54.819 --> 00:45:04.579
Shri Krishna's friendship is well known, you
know with Sudama how He behaved.

00:45:04.579 --> 00:45:13.720
All His beautiful manifestations must show
in your character.

00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:18.779
Then only this country can be saved.

00:45:18.779 --> 00:45:31.500
I must say it's nowhere, we have Canada, we
have people also I am told from Austria.

00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:35.289
From all over, from England.

00:45:35.289 --> 00:45:40.970
But still, we are not so many people as we
should have been.

00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:48.190
If you just take Austrians, they must be double
of this.

00:45:48.190 --> 00:45:53.440
If they could do it, why can't we do it?

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:59.319
Because we do not introspect and we do not
grow out of our egos.

00:45:59.319 --> 00:46:04.710
They will say that, "Why didn't Krishna meditate?"

00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:09.780
(Shri Mataji laughing) You have to meditate
on Shri Krishna.

00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:20.710
If He meditates what will happen to you all?

00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:26.349
On the whole, I was very happy with the other
day's program, somehow.

00:46:26.349 --> 00:46:41.030
Despite, as usual, in New York, our inability
to really do good advertising, unsystematic

00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:42.079
everything.

00:46:42.079 --> 00:46:48.289
Despite that we had so many people and I put
the responsibility on them.

00:46:48.289 --> 00:46:56.270
Because that's the thing - it is Shri Krishna's
responsibility.

00:46:56.270 --> 00:47:00.829
And that is what is your responsibility now.

00:47:00.829 --> 00:47:11.440
You are responsible for America and Canada,
South America.

00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:23.010
You all are responsible and you people should
be such that people who see you listen to

00:47:23.010 --> 00:47:32.890
you, are with you, should know that these
are the Gopa and Gopis of Shri Krishna.

00:47:32.890 --> 00:47:39.020
Unless and until that happens, this America
is the most difficult place.

00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:45.000
Sometimes I feel it's not Gokul but Mathura.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:49.960
So it is for you, and otherwise you cannot
enjoy.

00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:56.460
If you live with your all old clothes, you
can't enjoy.

00:47:56.460 --> 00:48:03.760
I must say this time there were so many people
and I have asked them to promise, and put

00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:11.580
a bandhan on them, and I'm sure they will
try to keep My promise.

00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:14.049
I am sure.

00:48:14.049 --> 00:48:17.380
But it is you people who disappoint them.

00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:23.310
When they see you, they are disappointed.

00:48:23.310 --> 00:48:35.290
Actually, here is the first time, Vishwa Nirmala
Dharma has been established as a religion.

00:48:35.290 --> 00:48:38.940
It is.

00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:44.200
But the rest of it is zero.

00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:57.630
So all this differences and divisiveness has
to finish and we should be one in the collective

00:48:57.630 --> 00:49:02.980
nature of Shri Krishna.

00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:08.200
First, meditation is very important.

00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:13.090
Introspection is very important.

00:49:13.090 --> 00:49:26.700
And also, meeting each other, talking to each
other, knowing each other is very important.

00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:27.869
It has worked all over.

00:49:27.869 --> 00:49:34.470
It has worked out in India tremendously, Russia
tremendously, Bulgaria tremendously, so why

00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:36.109
not here?

00:49:36.109 --> 00:49:43.430
It's no fashion for brainless people.

00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:52.660
It is a living process which has to take place
where you must mature.

00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:59.690
And what I find that Americans are not matured.

00:49:59.690 --> 00:50:03.760
But you are now mature.

00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:06.789
You are now mature people.

00:50:06.789 --> 00:50:11.430
And I hope you will all behave like mature
people henceforth.

00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:13.619
So may God bless you!

00:50:13.619 --> 00:50:31.730
There are 

00:50:31.730 --> 00:50:45.299
Shri Krishna's names they have written down
and I would request leaders to come on the

00:50:45.299 --> 00:50:47.710
stage.

00:50:47.710 --> 00:53:48.410
Now try to understand every word, every name
of Shri Krishna.

00:53:48.410 --> 00:56:45.779
[Hindi ?]

00:56:45.779 --> 01:00:09.339
Also, you 

01:00:09.339 --> 01:00:56.349
say 
the name first and then they 

01:00:56.349 --> 01:01:30.799
will repeat it.

01:01:30.799 --> 01:02:18.529
Name and 

01:02:18.529 --> 01:03:04.299
the meaning and they will repeat it.

01:03:04.299 --> 01:03:51.950
What about the children?

01:03:51.950 --> 01:04:03.769
They 

01:04:03.769 --> 01:05:29.849
can also come.

01:05:29.849 --> 01:10:55.160
Firstly let us do little bit of Ganesha Puja.

01:10:55.160 --> 01:13:27.470
If 

01:13:27.470 --> 01:18:20.760
there 

01:18:20.760 --> 01:19:08.340
are children.

01:19:08.340 --> 01:19:55.820
[Hindi ?]

01:19:55.820 --> 01:28:56.220
Very few children there are.

01:28:56.220 --> 01:58:55.320
Just a minute ??? - Ganesha Mantra.
