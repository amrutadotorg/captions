Shri Krishna -Virata Puja
“Rise above the Ego to enter Virata’s

07:55.659 --> 08:02.659
Kingdom”
September 9, 1999

08:09.599 --> 08:16.569
Cabella, Italia

09:15.335 --> 09:17.615
Tonight we

09:17.632 --> 09:31.092
are going to worship Shri Krishna as Virat.
First is important to understand the incarnation

09:34.260 --> 09:46.487
of Shri Krishna. Krishna word comes from the
word Krishi. Krishi means agriculture. He’s

09:46.512 --> 09:58.748
sown the seeds of spirituality. And for that,
first of all, He had to think, “Where are

09:58.894 --> 10:11.188
we as far as spirituality is concerned, how
is the land?” So what had happened at the

10:11.213 --> 10:20.838
time of Shri Rama that He created lots of
maryadas and by these maryadas people started

10:20.863 --> 10:26.353
mentally thinking about it, “I am not supposed
to do that, I am not supposed to do this.”

10:26.353 --> 10:34.654
It was just a mental binding – it was not
spontaneous, it was not sahaj. As a result

10:34.679 --> 10:43.225
people became extremely serious. They wouldn’t
talk much and they wouldn’t laugh; they

10:43.713 --> 10:46.248
wouldn’t enjoy anything.

10:46.273 --> 10:53.483
So Shri Krishna decided that “First of all
we must remove them from this conditioning.

10:54.248 --> 11:01.983
And this conditioning has to be removed in
such a manner that they enjoy themselves.”

11:08.287 --> 11:15.333
Then He found out, there were three suggestions
as far as achieving the goal was concerned.

11:15.358 --> 11:30.483
So first one, as He says, is to become a realized
soul, Sthitapragya, to go beyond all temptations,

11:31.103 --> 11:42.975
go beyond all ego, go beyond all kinds of
conditioning and to become a Sthitapragya.

11:43.692 --> 11:58.245
Sthitapragya is where he doesn’t feel like
ordinary people attracted towards things,

11:58.808 --> 12:19.519
but he’s absolutely detached. And
this detached person doesn’t take to any
grievances, jealousies, all these things.

12:20.480 --> 12:37.503
That He told. But how to achieve it He never
told. And the second thing He described is

12:37.558 --> 12:44.558
that you must work. You have to work. After
all, you have got all the human tendencies

12:44.988 --> 12:53.525
– is to work. But the fruit of the work,
you leave it at the Lotus Feet of God or you

12:53.828 --> 13:00.111
may call the divine Power. This is another
trick of His, because He realized how human

13:00.130 --> 13:05.599
beings were twisted and how they had a ego.
If you tell them something, how they’ll

13:05.599 --> 13:12.599
misinterpret it. So He took the other way
round, that tell them something absurd. Now

13:12.670 --> 13:26.973
whatever work you do, your ego is intact and
with that ego, you can never give it up at

13:27.260 --> 13:34.631
the Lotus Feet of the Divine, then impossible.
So He made a impossible situation, that after

13:34.913 --> 13:42.842
some time people will realize that this cannot
be done and they’ll give up this idea of

13:43.500 --> 13:51.545
leaving everything at the Lotus Feet of the
Divine. This was the one how He prepared the

13:51.570 --> 13:54.660
land.

13:54.660 --> 14:09.735
Second thing He said, “Pushpam phalam toyum.
Flowers, fruit and water. Whatever you offer

14:09.760 --> 14:18.574
Me, I will take it. I’ll take it.” But
when you do that, when you do that you must

14:18.599 --> 14:34.235
have ananya bhakti. Ananya means completely
single-minded bhakti, when there is not the

14:34.260 --> 14:44.194
other. This is only possible after realization.
Only after realization you can put the fruits

14:44.219 --> 14:53.204
of your work at the Lotus Feet of the Divine.
And only after Self-realization you can have

14:53.229 --> 15:04.491
ananya bhakti – means the devotion which
is singular. These absurd conditions He put

15:04.520 --> 15:09.630
for human beings because they were so much
complicated.

15:09.630 --> 15:14.250
So many people tell Me, “Mother we are doing
ananya bhakti.”

15:14.250 --> 15:14.500
“How?”

15:14.390 --> 15:20.510
“Because we are singing on the street, we
are taking the name of God all the time. We

15:20.510 --> 15:28.827
are going to Pandharipur, you see, in rags
and for one month we walk singing, singing,

15:28.852 --> 15:29.592
singing.”

15:30.229 --> 15:41.435
This kind of absurd ideas about bhakti, He
never gave. But it is the way He wanted to

15:41.460 --> 15:48.609
neutralize the absurdities of human beings,
that they thought this was the bhakti. Which

15:48.609 --> 15:56.745
is not. Ananya bhakti is only possible when
you are realized soul, when you are connected

15:56.770 --> 16:00.200
with the Divine, when there’s not the other.

16:00.200 --> 16:12.335
This is how He tried to make three-way attack
I should (say), on human beings, in a way,

16:12.590 --> 16:16.960
on their stupidity. Because He thought that
“If I tell them directly do like this, do

16:16.960 --> 16:23.450
like that, then they’ll say, ‘Of course
we did it, and still we never achieved it.’”

16:23.450 --> 16:31.827
In India there’s a big cult, we can call
it – people who go to Pandharipur. For one

16:32.022 --> 16:40.991
month they walk in rags, singing the songs
and on the way they go on eating food at different

16:41.059 --> 16:47.850
places. According to them this is ananya bhakti,
and they achieve nothing. They have become

16:47.850 --> 16:58.350
very sick and very tired and have a very bad
old age. But who can tell them? They are all

16:58.500 --> 17:10.255
lost in it. So this is a way one could tackle
human beings to show their stupidity. And

17:10.280 --> 17:16.190
so many people come and ask Me, as I told
you, that “How is it we do so much bhakti

17:16.190 --> 17:20.619
of Shri Krishna and we have achieved nothing?”

17:20.619 --> 17:29.285
So He’s the One who prepared the land for
sowing. We can say He’s the One who was

17:29.310 --> 17:35.869
like a very great agriculturist. So His name
was Krishi – Krishna. There are so many

17:35.869 --> 17:42.340
things I have told you about Him: how His
name came as Krishna, then as how He was called

17:42.340 --> 17:55.350
as Radha, who was Radha, who was Krishna and
all those things. But when He talked of these

17:55.800 --> 18:02.800
things also He told that you should become
Sthitapragya. That is they call as Gyana Yoga.

18:03.770 --> 18:11.170
Gyana means knowledge. So, you should get
absolute knowledge. That He didn’t say how.

18:11.300 --> 18:17.897
That you know, what is absolute knowledge,
which you can feel it on your finger tips

18:17.922 --> 18:20.712
in Sahaja Yoga.

18:21.944 --> 18:29.186
Another thing is, His specialty was to create
discretion in people. He thought by doing

18:29.211 --> 18:35.600
all these things in a stupid manner, they
might develop a discretion to know that this

18:35.600 --> 18:41.980
is not the way you can achieve anything. You
have to get your Self-realization. Discretion

18:41.980 --> 18:52.475
was very important. At this juncture, when
we are facing a sort of a challenge of this

18:53.010 --> 19:00.967
new millennium – that the whole world is
going to be destroyed and all those things

19:01.050 --> 19:09.139
people are talking – it is really very important
to know through discretion what is good and

19:09.164 --> 19:18.842
what is bad. One may talk of something as
very good, something as very bad. But the

19:18.967 --> 19:28.038
divine Discretion is very, very different.
Very different and which acts by Itself. Once

19:28.063 --> 19:33.920
you are in the realm of divine Discretion
you cannot commit mistakes – even if you

19:33.945 --> 19:35.374
want to do it.

19:35.400 --> 19:47.265
I’ll give you My example. We went to buy
a house and the fellow was, you see, like

19:47.290 --> 19:55.144
a beggar he came. He said, “We have nothing.
We have no food. They have taken away all

19:55.169 --> 20:02.775
our things and we are just absolutely starving.”
When they said that, when he said that “We

20:02.800 --> 20:08.380
are starving, we have nothing,” so I felt
pity for him.

20:08.380 --> 20:12.360
I said, “All right, increase the price.”
First we increased the price.

20:12.360 --> 20:15.689
Still he was saying, “No, no give us more.”

20:15.689 --> 20:21.990
Still we increased the price. I told My husband,
“You increase the price.” Though reluctantly,

20:21.990 --> 20:25.820
he increased the price. Third time again we
increased the price.

20:25.820 --> 20:32.820
Then he said, “No, we’ll have something
more than that, a little more.”

20:33.400 --> 20:38.340
Immediately you see, this Discretion worked
and I said, “These are hypocrites.” I

20:38.340 --> 20:45.575
just left them and sat in the car – at the
right moment. That was not such a good proposition

20:45.600 --> 20:53.413
or anything. But I could see they, I’m buying
it out of My pity; you may call it compassion.

20:54.189 --> 21:00.520
But above the compassion was this Discretion,
which said, “Nothing doing, You better get

21:00.520 --> 21:07.705
out of it.” So this divine Discretion is
a very, very important thing, which we should

21:07.730 --> 21:15.445
see how it works and should be satisfied with
it. Not to feel bad, that you have missed

21:15.470 --> 21:21.730
a chance or anything, but you must feel very
happy that this thing has happened and that

21:21.730 --> 21:26.820
your divine discretion has taken on.

21:26.820 --> 21:33.740
So sometimes it appears that, in that divine
discretion you may do something wrong, you

21:33.740 --> 21:40.740
have done something wrong. But if it is divine,
ultimately it will turn out to be very good.

21:40.765 --> 21:50.050
I gave you a very basic example. But that
is also very true when you practice Sahaja

21:53.260 --> 22:03.264
Yoga. The discretion of divine Discretion
is extremely important to play a very great

22:03.342 --> 22:12.644
part in our lives, because this divine Discretion
gives us the real joy of our being, of our

22:12.669 --> 22:14.366
self, of Sahaja Yoga.

22:16.350 --> 22:25.894
So the third point was for Him to make people
joyous and happy. But with all these maryadas

22:25.919 --> 22:34.674
of Shri Rama, He didn’t know how to do it.
So to give people joy He said, “All right,

22:34.699 --> 22:42.999
let us dance, let us sing, let us play Holi,
all sorts of things,” and with that He really

22:43.024 --> 22:51.100
originated many things which were sort of
not serious. May look frivolous, but in that

22:51.125 --> 23:02.065
there was joy expressing. All that He did
to give them a full idea as for a Sahaja yogi

23:02.090 --> 23:08.990
or for a, you can say, for a self realized
soul, what should be the attitude towards

23:08.990 --> 23:17.434
everything. But it is not that you have to
do it, but it just works out, it is like that,

23:17.459 --> 23:28.538
that in the state of Sahaj, you enjoy everything.
Enjoyment. And that is what His idea was,

23:28.679 --> 23:36.485
to create a sense of joy among people. Many
people – there are lots of critics – have

23:36.510 --> 23:40.050
criticized this part of His life. According
to them, religion means you should become

23:40.050 --> 23:49.005
just old. At the age of twenty years you should
become an old man of eighty years – something

23:49.030 --> 23:58.865
like that, funny ideas of religious achievement.
But He talked of joy and He never talked of

23:58.890 --> 24:05.860
renunciation. He never talked that “You
give up your family, you give up your children,

24:05.860 --> 24:14.250
you give up everything,” never, never. He
said, “You must enjoy, enjoy with detachment.”

24:14.800 --> 24:20.919
For people it is very difficult to understand
how can it be it is without detachment. With

24:20.919 --> 24:28.535
attachment you can never enjoy. If you are
attached to something, you cannot enjoy anything

24:28.560 --> 24:34.189
in a full way. Like, supposing you are attached
to your child. Very simple thing, you are

24:34.189 --> 24:40.620
attached to your child. You’re attached
to your child, then you will be bothered about

24:40.620 --> 24:45.420
things which should not be there, which will
not give joy to the child either. You’ll

24:45.420 --> 24:53.235
not allow your child, say, to go out or to
talk to people, whatever it is – all kinds

24:53.260 --> 25:02.855
of restrictions you will put. But if you have
really the divine discretion, then you will

25:02.880 --> 25:09.510
know with whom he should talk, where he should
go, what he should enjoy and you will see

25:09.510 --> 25:13.117
that he enjoys life.

25:13.142 --> 25:21.522
Any attachment with anything doesn’t give
you the full view of that person, of that

25:21.547 --> 25:33.187
thing. If you are detached, then you can see
it, say, from above … above him, above the

25:33.360 --> 25:40.160
thing. If you are detached, you become thoughtlessly
aware, also. As I said, now, see the carpets

25:40.160 --> 25:48.804
are there. They are very, very beautiful carpets.
Now if they are here, if they are Mine, I’ll

25:48.829 --> 25:53.459
be worried, I’ll be all the time worried
because I am attached – that these carpets

25:53.459 --> 25:59.750
should not be spoilt, something will go wrong.
But if I’m not attached, I’ll look at

25:59.750 --> 26:06.750
those carpets and what do I see? The joy.
The joy that is put in by the artist who has

26:07.459 --> 26:21.525
made them. And that joy really tries to reflect
in Me also. That joy comes in Me. So to have

26:21.550 --> 26:30.572
anything, attachment to anything, there will
be joy … I should say there’ll be happiness

26:31.079 --> 26:40.525
but not joy. Because joy is single and happiness
is double – happiness and unhappiness.

26:41.589 --> 26:45.829
So even if I try to enjoy something, I’ll
think, “Oh, still there, this, this point

26:45.829 --> 26:55.509
is there.” But joy is all pervading. It
has no boundaries. And you just get dissolved,

26:55.540 --> 27:03.914
you get dissolved in the ocean of joy. That
was what Shri Krishna’s idea was, that cut

27:03.939 --> 27:13.189
out these maryadas. Nowadays we see the maryadas
of so many things are really useless. For

27:13.798 --> 27:20.959
example, you have discovered the maryadas
of religion. See when they live in maryadas

27:21.170 --> 27:29.603
then what happens? They sort of coggle it
or they have all kinds of germination inside

27:30.620 --> 27:39.017
like the pond, which is absolutely bound,
it is not flowing like river. So like that,

27:39.830 --> 27:52.744
you see, it becomes a kind of a closed mind
with these maryadas. And when you have this

27:52.860 --> 28:00.064
maryadas, you start thinking, “Whether I
should do it or not; whether I’ll enjoy

28:00.089 --> 28:06.220
it or not.” With these maryadas only, you
kill the joy.

28:06.245 --> 28:12.339
Now we have other maryadas about, say, we
have country … as I said about the religion.

28:12.339 --> 28:18.760
Now many people who love to come to Sahaj
Yoga, but because they have maryadas of silly

28:18.760 --> 28:25.760
things of their religion, they cannot come.
They think, “This is our religion,” while

28:26.110 --> 28:31.870
they don’t understand. Falsehood becomes
the maryadas and they don’t understand that

28:31.870 --> 28:37.380
what is the maryada actually made by the religion
also.

28:37.380 --> 28:43.910
You see now in Islam what is happening is.
With these maryadas, they want to have another

28:43.910 --> 28:51.494
country, this thing, that thing. In other
Christian religion also same thing happening.

28:51.579 --> 28:58.339
Also in Hindu religion. All these maryadas
are really stagnating them completely, and

28:58.339 --> 29:07.034
they are getting crushed into it. There’s
no discretion. Because they have said it,

29:07.059 --> 29:15.154
they do it. They are so much blind-folded
about it, that they cannot see what is right

29:15.179 --> 29:22.179
and what is wrong. But after Sahaj, you can
see, you can laugh at them and you can see.

29:22.300 --> 29:29.735
Then we have social maryadas. Social maryadas
are there which are sometimes, when abandoned

29:29.760 --> 29:36.760
can become very horrid also. Like in the West
now, the women think that the less dress they

29:37.040 --> 29:47.095
wear, the more beautiful they are. This is
a new thing they have started. Now this absurd.

29:47.400 --> 29:54.885
If you see the discretion behind is very simple:
that we have been animals and now we don’t

29:54.910 --> 30:03.414
want to have any clothes because we were animals.
Is a animal heritage that if … that’s

30:03.439 --> 30:10.745
why so many women do not want to wear full
dresses. It’s just animal behavior. So the

30:10.770 --> 30:17.770
maryada of – good maryadas also people can
give up saying that “We don’t want any

30:18.030 --> 30:24.079
maryadas. We are free; we can do whatever
we like.” But in that freedom what do you

30:24.079 --> 30:31.079
achieve? Your animal instinct works in that
freedom and you think you are a very free

30:31.104 --> 30:32.250
personality.

30:32.720 --> 30:38.500
Then we have maryadas of our country. God
has not made different, different countries

30:38.500 --> 30:45.705
at all. Nor it is true there are different
countries, but variety is there. Variety of

30:45.730 --> 30:52.730
people, variety of places is there. These
varieties must be accepted as something very

30:53.500 --> 31:00.500
artistic and one should not get ruined and
confused with those ideas that “We are Americans,

31:00.525 --> 31:06.380
we are Indians, we are this and we are that.”
You’re not. Now you can know after Sahaja

31:06.380 --> 31:13.380
Yoga, that you are all Sahaja yogis and you
don’t belong to any country as such. The

31:13.530 --> 31:16.490
country may belong to you, but you don’t
belong to the country.

31:16.515 --> 31:25.395
I mean the work is today to understand that
if you really want to care for all these countries

31:25.420 --> 31:33.705
and all that, then you must do some work – work
of Sahaja Yoga so that people get rid of these

31:33.730 --> 31:40.459
silly ideas of fighting for territory, for
this, for that. All over the world there’s

31:40.459 --> 31:47.459
going on, “We want this land; we want that
land.” Land belongs to God, not to human

31:47.589 --> 31:53.819
beings. And what is the use of fighting for
land? I don’t understand. But this confusion

31:53.819 --> 31:59.740
is there and illusion is there. And people
work out on this confusion and illusion to

31:59.740 --> 32:04.860
such an extent that they ruin their lives,
the lives of their children. So many people

32:04.860 --> 32:13.249
are lost, so many people are in the lunatic
asylum, I should say, because they end up

32:13.620 --> 32:20.620
in some sort of a refugee camp. They are having
a good house, nicely living there. Then you

32:20.620 --> 32:28.063
become a refugee. Why? Because they believe
that they can have their own land, they can

32:28.088 --> 32:33.910
have their own place and they should live
there.

32:33.910 --> 32:41.034
This idea comes, I think, from some stupid
leaders who want to have for themselves these

32:41.059 --> 32:48.635
lands and that’s how people fight for land.
There’s no need to fight for land or fight

32:48.660 --> 32:55.069
for your country or fight for this or fight
for that. But the situation is such that unless

32:55.069 --> 33:02.069
and until you fight, you cannot get to the
truth. And that’s why if you remember that

33:02.260 --> 33:10.116
Shri Krishna told Arjuna that “You fight.
Fight. You have to fight, that’s your work.

33:10.179 --> 33:16.640
You have to fight these people, because they
are the people who do not live with dharma.

33:16.640 --> 33:20.350
They are adharmis, so you have to fight.”

33:20.350 --> 33:28.585
And that is how his fighting was so much justified,
because after fighting the war they got back

33:28.610 --> 33:37.005
what they deserved. They were deceived, and
this is what Shri Krishna said that “You

33:37.030 --> 33:45.290
should not by any chance become a slave of
these people, but you fight it back.”

33:47.641 --> 33:54.780
So fighting also is justified in the divine
discretion. Is again the divine discretion

33:55.199 --> 34:00.299
where you have to fight because you don’t
want to be a slave. If you are a slave, you

34:00.299 --> 34:07.805
are no good. So for that you can fight. But
when people start fighting for separation

34:08.160 --> 34:15.758
of a territory, is not correct. On the contrary,
one should never think of separating from

34:15.883 --> 34:23.270
the main lands. Because it creates lots of
problems. But now we believe in the global

34:23.309 --> 34:30.130
religion. We believe in the global territory.
We don’t have to ask for anything. Anywhere

34:30.130 --> 34:39.335
you go, you are the citizen of that place.
Anybody who wants to go to Russia ever, the

34:39.360 --> 34:42.929
whole Russians will be with you. You go to
America, they’ll be with you. That’s how

34:42.929 --> 34:49.860
because all these are ideas of human beings,
and if the human beings get transformed there

34:49.860 --> 34:56.860
will be no problem of any war or any territory
to be achieved.

34:57.139 --> 35:04.954
This was the divine Discretion of Shri Krishna,
which is instilled within us. As you know

35:05.059 --> 35:16.969
that this is a part and parcel of the Vishuddhi
Chakra, where Shri Krishna resides; but when

35:17.258 --> 35:28.315
He rises to your Sahasrara, when He rises
to that level, then He becomes Virata. So

35:28.340 --> 35:41.574
Virata’s Chakra is placed in the head, here
above the Agnya, and this Virat is the form

35:41.599 --> 35:52.125
of Shri Krishna who has risen above the Agnya.
When you are risen above the Agnya, you become

35:52.210 --> 36:02.725
a part and parcel of Virata’s land, we can
say. Because, unless and until you are above

36:02.750 --> 36:11.824
your ego, you are still involved with yourself
and with wrong ideas of maryadas. But when

36:11.849 --> 36:19.774
you rise above that and you become the Virat,
the great, then you are in the land of Virata.

36:20.422 --> 36:28.461
And Virata’s powers are tremendous. Has
been seen by Arjuna – the form of Virat.

36:28.930 --> 36:37.094
The power of Virat becomes so tremendous that
it acts globally. It acts in such a manner

36:37.369 --> 36:50.496
that you sit here and anywhere it can act.
You have seen that now. Many a times people

36:50.559 --> 36:57.849
say, “Mother it’s a miracle. My mother
was sick and she was not here and I just prayed

36:57.869 --> 37:04.559
and she got all right.” This is all the
power of Virat.

37:04.559 --> 37:13.085
The power of Virata is that it can penetrate
into the subtle side of human beings in such

37:13.110 --> 37:20.505
a manner that everything we are connected
with. We are not separate. And every drop

37:20.530 --> 37:28.215
is connected with the ocean. We are connected
with the whole universe. And when you become

37:28.240 --> 37:39.325
a citizens, I should say, of Virat, then all
the things with which you are connected also

37:39.360 --> 37:52.925
get your vibrations, your ideas, your ambitions.
Everything passes through that and it works

37:52.950 --> 37:54.708
– it works.

37:54.733 --> 38:01.860
You have seen how many miracles have taken
place in your lives. It is the Virata Shakti

38:01.927 --> 38:16.300
that works. Now for that we have to know how
to do worship of Virata. First of all you

38:16.500 --> 38:26.797
have to rise above your ego – very important.
Otherwise how can you worship? There is your

38:27.508 --> 38:36.344
ego standing in between and how can you rise
up to the point of Virat? You have to pass

38:36.420 --> 38:46.545
through that. Once you are above your ego,
you enter into the kingdom of Virata. There

38:46.570 --> 38:55.227
the King is the Virat and you are the subject
who are looked after completely by Virata

38:55.400 --> 38:59.000
Shakti, by the power of Virata.

38:59.000 --> 39:06.574
But at that stage you become really a universal
personality, in a way, because whatever are

39:06.599 --> 39:13.559
problems universally – now not necessarily
that they should be attached to you or connected

39:13.559 --> 39:20.559
to you. Supposing a person is of that level.
Now there may be a war in some other country

39:21.309 --> 39:32.688
– it can stop. Somebody who is being oppressed
can win over. Anywhere your compassion moves

39:33.210 --> 39:39.430
it works out. Whenever your attention will
go, it will work out. And sometimes you are

39:39.430 --> 39:46.260
surprised as to how it works, “Mother, how
these things work out? How coincidences … how

39:46.260 --> 39:53.764
these coincidences have taken place?” Only
thing is you have crossed that state of your

39:53.789 --> 40:00.660
ego and have gone into the state of Virat,
which is a very important thing to do – is

40:00.660 --> 40:07.660
to enter into the area of Virata. Then you
don’t think, “This is your country. This

40:07.789 --> 40:09.829
belongs to you, that belongs to you.”

40:09.829 --> 40:17.844
This belonging business finishes off. Then
you belong to Virat. And He uses you for His

40:17.869 --> 40:26.168
own purpose in the sense that when your whole
thinking is different – becomes global thinking,

40:26.340 --> 40:36.613
then He acts. And then His powers are many-fold.
And Krishna’s power is that He uses a conch

40:36.690 --> 40:44.935
to call people. I have given conches to all
the leaders. So we have to now announce and

40:44.960 --> 40:56.211
call people. But at the level of Virat, you
don’t have to do all that. At the level

40:56.260 --> 41:06.855
of Virat it just – people see, they’ll
know. Just they will watch you and they will

41:06.880 --> 41:15.954
know. Just they will think you are human beings
and you are so sweet, so good, just like gems

41:16.000 --> 41:23.000
shining all the time. So, they’ll be impressed.
This comes through the Virata’s blessing.

41:23.180 --> 41:30.766
When you become that, then you forget about
other things like you have big positions or

41:30.800 --> 41:38.455
anything, you come from a very rich family
or that – all these nonsensical things which

41:38.480 --> 41:47.555
are actually not true. And all these things
on which you want to exist are no more. People

41:47.580 --> 42:00.795
like to show off their wealth, some people
like to be very sort of demonstrative of what

42:00.820 --> 42:09.633
they think they are. But in the case of a
person who rises above his ego, and he’s

42:09.730 --> 42:17.836
a part and parcel of that Virata shakti, enters
into the kingdom of Virata, he knows he is

42:17.879 --> 42:26.275
very small. He is very small compared to that
and he just dissolves into that Shakti. And

42:26.300 --> 42:33.735
this should happen to us that we should humble
down. We should humble down and know that

42:33.760 --> 42:41.532
our powers, whatever we have, if they give
us ego, we should get rid of it. We should

42:41.797 --> 42:50.063
not have that ego. We should get rid of it
and we should actually achieve that state

42:50.240 --> 42:57.625
where you can be called as citizens of the
Virata’s Power.

42:57.650 --> 43:03.172
May God bless you all.

45:02.165 --> 45:06.235
Now when you are entering into the kingdom
of Virata, you have

45:06.518 --> 45:16.813
like children. You are children there. As
children you enter. As Christ has said, “When

45:16.838 --> 45:20.288
you enter into the Kingdom of God
you have to

45:20.296 --> 45:23.513
be like children.” And that’s what you
have to

45:23.538 --> 45:25.630
be today, all of you to

45:25.655 --> 45:29.974
be innocent like children. You have to

45:30.005 --> 45:34.106
be innocent like children.

48:32.747 --> 48:39.747
to be
