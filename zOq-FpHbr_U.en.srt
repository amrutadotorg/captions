1
00:00:13,873 --> 00:00:17,138
What a place ha? Beautiful!

2
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:24,410
How did you all get here?

3
00:00:31,651 --> 00:00:34,151
More coming.

4
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:43,375
Beautiful!

5
00:01:14,503 --> 00:01:17,003
Would you like a drink, Shri Mataji?

6
00:01:18,718 --> 00:01:21,218
Diet Coke would be fine.

7
00:01:33,017 --> 00:01:38,187
So we are with the nature here. So beautiful!

8
00:01:51,492 --> 00:01:56,971
The way it is planned you can see how the person who has planned it had the feel of the land,

9
00:01:56,979 --> 00:01:58,791
feel of the nature.

10
00:01:58,805 --> 00:02:05,141
How he has made up, by not destroying it.

11
00:02:05,148 --> 00:02:09,672
Whatever is there he used it,

12
00:02:09,678 --> 00:02:13,362
otherwise they would have put one
bulldozer and finished it off.

13
00:02:16,005 --> 00:02:24,149
The way it is planned shows he had feeling
for the land and he could understand.

14
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:27,399
The way we look at nature also, is our own.

15
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:32,391
The way we are inside, that’s how we look at nature.

16
00:02:32,391 --> 00:02:37,061
Nature is our friend absolutely;
it's working for us all the time.

17
00:02:37,067 --> 00:02:39,567
And we don’t do much for it.

18
00:02:41,747 --> 00:02:44,247
Look at these trees.

19
00:02:46,347 --> 00:02:50,475
They give shade, they give fruits.

20
00:02:50,482 --> 00:02:55,534
Whatever is possible for them, they do it.

21
00:02:55,546 --> 00:03:00,304
And when they are old, we use them for wood.

22
00:03:01,612 --> 00:03:04,112
All supportive to our life.

23
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:12,232
But we must have feeling; otherwise, what’s
happening today is this ecological problem.

24
00:03:21,956 --> 00:03:29,476
And this is because we do not have
any feeling for the Mother Earth

25
00:03:29,486 --> 00:03:33,006
No feeling for the nature.

26
00:03:33,016 --> 00:03:39,326
We are really plundering them
and then the whole thing reacts.

27
00:03:45,119 --> 00:03:48,871
It's a kind of an aggression that

28
00:03:54,553 --> 00:03:57,801
you want to have so many
things at the same time

29
00:04:00,192 --> 00:04:06,580
That I have seen once, first
when we went to England,

30
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:15,969
we never served any drinks in our house in India, but in England nobody would come to your house, so we had to organise.

31
00:04:15,969 --> 00:04:20,229
I told C.P. that “You better
do something about it.”

32
00:04:20,251 --> 00:04:26,347
So he went and bought some
books, how to organise.

33
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:31,437
So first the question of tumblers.

34
00:04:31,443 --> 00:04:34,727
And so many types of tumblers you had to use.

35
00:04:34,727 --> 00:04:39,580
But we had to get about twenty-four of
the best crystal, the best crystal.

36
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:50,569
Because for everything there's a different
type of a crystal that you have to have.

37
00:04:51,949 --> 00:04:56,448
I just thought that if you had some
silver, it would be much better.

38
00:04:56,448 --> 00:05:04,258
One glass of silver is sufficient, once for
all your lifetime, your children’s lifetime.

39
00:05:04,244 --> 00:05:08,108
Instead of that, all these things like crystal.

40
00:05:08,124 --> 00:05:14,793
But at least it was crystal, it was all right
because it was in a way, some sort of an art

41
00:05:17,003 --> 00:05:25,414
And then I learnt how they make, even in England, etching and all that. Beautiful in Scotland!

42
00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:30,016
English crystal also is nice.
The best is Czechoslovakian.

43
00:05:30,036 --> 00:05:40,366
All these things I learnt there with
that horrible sets of tumblers

44
00:05:40,393 --> 00:05:46,833
and you had to have the best quality,

45
00:05:46,845 --> 00:05:53,967
that's something, part of the prestige, you see.

46
00:05:53,971 --> 00:05:56,927
So somebody will come and just see the glass,

47
00:06:02,107 --> 00:06:03,931
slowly, you see.

48
00:06:03,937 --> 00:06:07,902
And the plates also, they’ll
come and just turn round.

49
00:06:09,352 --> 00:06:12,047
First I didn’t know what was happening.

50
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:15,062
Because that’s not done in India,
I mean nobody’s bothered, you see.

51
00:06:15,072 --> 00:06:19,812
Only if there’s art they will appreciate, finished.

52
00:06:19,832 --> 00:06:24,932
We don’t have Saville Rows and all
that in India, so it's different.

53
00:06:24,962 --> 00:06:35,956
And that’s what I felt, that so many
tumblers are needed for one household.

54
00:06:35,956 --> 00:06:44,186
So, they are spending so much
money to buy all these varieties.

55
00:06:46,574 --> 00:06:51,342
But the worst is in America and
now they’re suffering from it.

56
00:06:51,352 --> 00:06:53,852
Even in plastic they have varieties.

57
00:06:53,852 --> 00:06:56,352
So you go to somebody’s house, so they…

58
00:07:11,325 --> 00:07:14,782
Must have been frightened the way we are sitting out here.

59
00:07:28,157 --> 00:07:39,349
So even in plastic they would, say, they have plastic tumblers which are just usable once.

60
00:07:39,371 --> 00:07:43,239
So they use once that, then it’s thrown out.

61
00:07:43,258 --> 00:07:48,099
Even in the drawing room, in a, say, restaurant or anything,

62
00:07:48,114 --> 00:07:50,404
even in their own drawing
rooms they have plastics.

63
00:07:50,404 --> 00:07:53,634
Can you imagine?

64
00:07:53,654 --> 00:07:58,034
And then they will use a lot
of paper, plastic things.

65
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:01,480
They never have proper plates.

66
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:05,490
They may be very rich but they
are always on the picnic, you see

67
00:08:05,504 --> 00:08:11,961
eating with the paper plates, using plastic things.

68
00:08:11,981 --> 00:08:14,481
But they are so proud of it.

69
00:08:14,481 --> 00:08:18,966
You see, this is a new one that
has come now in the plastic scene, nicely.

70
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:25,501
What is so great about
this? It's after all plastic.

71
00:08:25,482 --> 00:08:28,305
It's new, you see, new.  New is the idea.

72
00:08:31,312 --> 00:08:36,855
Then everything has to be different. Every year.

73
00:08:36,864 --> 00:08:43,699
So this is the fashion this
year, so this kind of clothes

74
00:08:52,968 --> 00:08:55,931
There's a bomb scare or what?

75
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:06,659
I feel they've come for lunch.

76
00:09:30,964 --> 00:09:36,960
Now they go on discarding this plastic
that they use, then dresses also.

77
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:41,251
This is the fashion in Paris,
so that’s the dress comes in.

78
00:09:41,261 --> 00:09:45,901
Then the entrepreneurs have really
made us slaves out of that

79
00:09:45,915 --> 00:09:54,128
Now, if you are dressed differently they say,
“Oh, you are out of fashions, out of date.”

80
00:09:54,128 --> 00:09:57,165
So one lady came to see Me

81
00:09:57,144 --> 00:10:07,665
She had pants cut here, here, jeans
you see cut here, there, everywhere.

82
00:10:07,695 --> 00:10:12,195
I was just worried that if she
sits on me, it may give way

83
00:10:12,205 --> 00:10:14,705
The way it was cut.

84
00:10:14,705 --> 00:10:21,946
And a funny type of a shirt with all cuttings
everywhere, all the threads coming out.

85
00:10:21,923 --> 00:10:25,536
So I said, "Why are you dressed up like this?"

86
00:10:25,554 --> 00:10:28,054
"I'm up to date."

87
00:10:37,994 --> 00:10:41,108
So I asked her, "What about
Me?" "You're antique!"

88
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:48,470
I said, "Antique is more
precious than up- to-date."

89
00:10:54,460 --> 00:11:01,134
So in India, we say that these people
have got now the desire to be beggars.

90
00:11:01,169 --> 00:11:02,904
With everything beggarish!

91
00:11:02,923 --> 00:11:09,606
The houses are beggarish, dresses are
beggarish, the hair are beggarish.

92
00:11:09,632 --> 00:11:12,132
To add up to it, drugs have come,

93
00:11:12,132 --> 00:11:21,790
so it’s all absolutely… you feel you are
in some sort of a fish market, smelling.

94
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:27,370
The way people live is… I mean, they
are no way better than our slumming,

95
00:11:27,397 --> 00:11:30,630
the way they live, the way they eat,
the way they live their daily lives.

96
00:11:30,628 --> 00:11:34,271
They have money, not that
they don’t have money.

97
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:37,930
Well they probably pay lots of money
for the clothes with the cuts in.

98
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:42,860
Oh, they pay more for that. They pay more.

99
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:49,660
But you go to any house you
see, England is worse this way,

100
00:11:49,646 --> 00:11:55,612
and when I was searching for a house,
we had to go from places to places.

101
00:11:55,645 --> 00:11:59,612
Quite big houses we were looking out for.

102
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:05,472
Suddenly, you find two legs of
pants falling on you from somewhere

103
00:12:05,482 --> 00:12:08,612
and then some shirts coming on your faces.

104
00:12:08,609 --> 00:12:10,112
"What's this?"

105
00:12:10,115 --> 00:12:14,092
"Oh, these are old clothes we have, you see."

106
00:12:14,115 --> 00:12:15,002
"Since long?"

107
00:12:15,002 --> 00:12:17,502
"Oh no! This was last year's."

108
00:12:17,502 --> 00:12:19,577
"Why are you keeping them?"

109
00:12:19,577 --> 00:12:22,077
"What to do?"

110
00:12:22,097 --> 00:12:29,521
"Ah, better throw them away somewhere, give away to someone."

111
00:12:31,131 --> 00:12:34,526
"No, we are keeping them. Maybe
the fashion might come back."

112
00:12:34,526 --> 00:12:37,736
Piles and piles and piles.

113
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:43,916
You get into a room and suddenly
you are on a pile of dirty clothes.

114
00:12:43,944 --> 00:12:48,833
So untidy! So horribly lousy!

115
00:12:48,843 --> 00:12:51,343
This is advancement.

116
00:12:51,343 --> 00:12:53,843
This is what we have progressed.

117
00:12:54,873 --> 00:13:00,317
So this funny greed of having
more and more and more and more,

118
00:13:00,317 --> 00:13:03,506
I mean, you can have, but
have something artistic

119
00:13:03,524 --> 00:13:06,846
so you won’t have too many
things, you’ll have few.

120
00:13:06,874 --> 00:13:11,307
If you try to have artistic things,
then you will have some few things

121
00:13:11,317 --> 00:13:13,817
But if you want to buy
plastic, there’s no end to it.

122
00:13:19,528 --> 00:13:26,558
The clothes are all artificial these days
and in that the fashions are changing.

123
00:13:26,575 --> 00:13:31,955
So we should not be slave of these entrepreneurs who are just befooling us all the time.

124
00:13:31,965 --> 00:13:34,465
In the market something comes up funny,

125
00:13:34,465 --> 00:13:38,235
transparent clothes, you see, made of plastic.

126
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:44,637
Something absurd, you know sometimes
the clothes are very absurd.

127
00:13:44,647 --> 00:13:48,787
Like they had very tight
jeans once upon a time.

128
00:13:48,812 --> 00:13:52,857
And they tighten it by … they said
that you wear it and get into the tub.

129
00:13:52,888 --> 00:13:55,914
And when you come out they
just stick to your body.

130
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,054
And then you bathe with it all the time.

131
00:13:58,054 --> 00:14:01,714
I don’t know if they bathe
also, that’s another point.

132
00:14:01,714 --> 00:14:06,044
Now, it’s such a funny
thing that with this,

133
00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:11,509
the ladies couldn’t get into the buses
so they were to be pushed in you see.

134
00:14:17,179 --> 00:14:20,866
But the worst was that they
developed varicose veins.

135
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:27,876
So they would come to Me.
I said, “Why did you wear?”

136
00:14:27,898 --> 00:14:30,970
That was the fashion. Then
they started with the baggy ones,

137
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,490
with the holes, holey pants.

138
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:40,828
Like that, you see, moving from one to
another, having too many things of no value

139
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:46,888
So the Sahaja yogis should understand
that we are friends of the nature.

140
00:14:46,893 --> 00:14:51,173
And whatever nature gives
us, we have to respect it

141
00:14:51,188 --> 00:14:56,983
Better wear natural clothes as far as possible.

142
00:14:56,996 --> 00:15:04,223
One natural shirt is better
than three unnatural ones,

143
00:15:04,238 --> 00:15:09,483
because you can breathe better, your skin
breathes better, you can wash it better.

144
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:15,383
So best is to take to more natural
things. I think this trend is coming up,

145
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:20,183
and that’s a very good trend, that
we should take to natural things.

146
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:27,021
And when we take to natural things, there’s
one thing we cannot have too many of it.

147
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:32,558
But if you start using something plastic,

148
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:38,954
then there can be any number and that's
how you really torture the Mother Earth.

149
00:15:38,969 --> 00:15:41,989
First of all, you dig her out.

150
00:15:41,999 --> 00:15:44,709
Then you wear all these things.

151
00:15:44,716 --> 00:15:47,819
And they cannot be destroyed.

152
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:50,346
There are mountains and mountains!

153
00:15:50,346 --> 00:15:54,139
Mountains and mountains of this
plastic if you go in America.

154
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:58,785
Even in England I’ve seen
mountains, such a filthy sight.

155
00:15:58,777 --> 00:16:05,178
They can’t burn it. If you
put it in the sea, it floats.

156
00:16:05,187 --> 00:16:13,557
And wherever you go near all
these so - called very big cities,

157
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:22,856
if you see the sea from the aeroplane
you find all littered up completely.

158
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:32,343
So we are spoiling our beaches, we are
spoiling our homes and wasting our money.

159
00:16:33,805 --> 00:16:39,190
So these entrepreneurs have
no feelings for the nature.

160
00:16:39,194 --> 00:16:42,180
They never think what nature is like.

161
00:16:46,844 --> 00:16:49,344
When I wanted to build this Pratishthan,

162
00:16:49,344 --> 00:16:55,084
the five six architects from
India (they’re Sahaja yogis also)

163
00:16:55,104 --> 00:17:01,084
very well qualified but in
the Western manner, you know.

164
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:12,004
So the design they made was some sort of a colonial style house with a platform all along,

165
00:17:12,034 --> 00:17:15,054
because the land was like this, you see.

166
00:17:15,054 --> 00:17:20,278
So they took the zero point as the highest.

167
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:25,209
So you hang on a platform, for which
you have to pay enormous amount.

168
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:32,647
I said, " All the way we have not come
to this place to hang in the air."

169
00:17:32,643 --> 00:17:34,758
They couldn't understand
what I was talking to them.

170
00:17:34,758 --> 00:17:37,258
I said, "I want to stick to the ground.

171
00:17:37,258 --> 00:17:40,873
I'll build the house on the ground."

172
00:17:40,888 --> 00:17:45,493
They said, "You have to make a topography,
you have to make this 'graphy,' that 'graphy.'"

173
00:17:45,503 --> 00:17:50,123
"This is very simple. What is this
'graphies' you are making? Just get to it."

174
00:17:52,934 --> 00:17:56,485
Luckily, they had gone all of them
on leave for about fifteen days.

175
00:17:56,503 --> 00:17:59,715
I changed the whole lot.

176
00:17:59,743 --> 00:18:04,620
And we would have been
hanging on twenty-two feet high.

177
00:18:04,628 --> 00:18:12,670
So I put one hall underneath that.

178
00:18:12,678 --> 00:18:17,996
And when you are moving down, you never
feel that you are going down that low.

179
00:18:19,424 --> 00:18:25,826
And it’s the personality of the nature
which is expressed in that house.

180
00:18:25,853 --> 00:18:28,082
It’s very interesting.

181
00:18:28,093 --> 00:18:31,242
You have seen Pratishthan?

182
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:34,942
Did you feel that you are going too
much down? Nobody feels that way.

183
00:18:34,951 --> 00:18:39,342
No you don't actually feel
you are going down at all.

184
00:18:39,362 --> 00:18:42,292
Well it is.

185
00:18:42,312 --> 00:18:44,812
but after fifteen days they returned.

186
00:18:44,812 --> 00:18:49,012
All go! "What?" "How?"

187
00:18:49,015 --> 00:18:53,835
It's going to happen." I said, "Nothing
going to happen, take it from Me."

188
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:59,265
I’ve used it the best way one has to use and
nothing is going to happen to your building.

189
00:18:59,302 --> 00:19:04,572
And they were after the builder. The builder said,
"Shri Mataji pays me, so I'm not bothered."

190
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,922
And it all worked out so well. So well!

191
00:19:09,922 --> 00:19:15,230
So this is what it is in the...
it's also labour saving, you see.

192
00:19:15,224 --> 00:19:19,550
If you ask somebody, “Why
do you wear plastic?”

193
00:19:19,538 --> 00:19:23,362
they say, “You don’t have to press it.”

194
00:19:23,382 --> 00:19:27,000
But what’s the harm in pressing?

195
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:33,440
You see there’s one cloth if you have to press it’s all right, it’s a good idea, or don’t press it.

196
00:19:33,447 --> 00:19:37,280
Don’t want to press, don’t press,
you’ll look quite neat, doesn’t matter.

197
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:45,537
But what is the need, I don’t
understand, we have so many plastics?

198
00:19:45,576 --> 00:19:50,246
So Sahaja yogis should avoid
plastic things as far as possible,

199
00:19:50,247 --> 00:19:56,147
especially for children, one should be
careful not to make them wear plastics.

200
00:20:03,312 --> 00:20:05,372
All of them are here, isn't it?

201
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:07,502
A gathering of the clans Mother!

202
00:20:07,503 --> 00:20:14,513
They must be going home. Either they are having a birthday party... or must be doing a training exercise.

203
00:20:14,523 --> 00:20:17,023
Or celebrating some rescue work.

204
00:20:20,003 --> 00:20:24,833
Why! Look at that (unclear)

205
00:20:28,053 --> 00:20:36,373
Shri Mataji, What about plastic toys
for the children? Is that a bad thing?

206
00:20:39,621 --> 00:20:42,228
Not very good for them.

207
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:48,868
Also these plastic napkins you
use for children are not necessary.

208
00:20:48,891 --> 00:20:53,368
Then you see, you become unattentive to children also with that.

209
00:20:56,898 --> 00:21:02,709
I mean, toys they play for a while but still
sometimes they put it in the mouth and…

210
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:17,210
If you see, children are more fond of things
made out of cloth or made out of wood.

211
00:21:17,214 --> 00:21:21,004
They like it. They like the feel of it.

212
00:21:21,014 --> 00:21:30,516
You put five plastic things and one thing made out of wood or made out of cloth, they’ll pick up the cloth one.

213
00:21:30,516 --> 00:21:35,076
They like the feel of the
smoothness of it, you see.

214
00:21:35,063 --> 00:21:41,256
They’re very expensive here, I agree,
but in India they’re very cheap

215
00:21:41,263 --> 00:21:44,376
This time in Madras I don’t know
if you picked up something or not,

216
00:21:44,393 --> 00:21:46,893
lots of things were there for sale for children.

217
00:21:50,213 --> 00:21:56,057
You see, they wouldn’t stop My car anywhere, I
was on the run, otherwise I would have bought.

218
00:21:56,082 --> 00:22:02,192
The wooden toys for girls are
very good in India. Beautiful!

219
00:22:02,207 --> 00:22:04,707
Also for boys!

220
00:22:06,873 --> 00:22:13,471
But the plastic toys which are covered
with cloth are all right, not so dangerous.

221
00:22:20,301 --> 00:22:24,522
Plastic is something that
penetrates into everything.

222
00:22:24,521 --> 00:22:27,021
Into everything!

223
00:22:28,971 --> 00:22:33,330
We also give too many toys to our children.

224
00:22:33,331 --> 00:22:39,580
In our days, a girl would have
only one doll or two dolls now.

225
00:22:39,589 --> 00:22:42,089
But now the plastic toys,

226
00:22:42,089 --> 00:22:49,277
the whole room is filled with it, I mean you have to just wade through to find out your child in all this.

227
00:22:49,273 --> 00:22:56,530
So many toys! Perhaps maybe we avoid
having relationship with our children.

228
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:04,714
We don’t talk to them, we have no time,
so give them some toys, stop them, there.

229
00:23:04,714 --> 00:23:07,214
Sort of a diversion.

230
00:23:08,254 --> 00:23:11,990
And that’s how we don’t know our children at all.

231
00:23:12,014 --> 00:23:18,180
Too many toys. And the toys also now are coming out

232
00:23:18,193 --> 00:23:22,880
in such a way that’s another slavery because
on the television they’ll advertise it.

233
00:23:22,897 --> 00:23:27,670
Your children will be after you, "I want that toy."

234
00:23:27,678 --> 00:23:35,367
There was a bear, they took it
out, which had a birth date.

235
00:23:35,357 --> 00:23:48,885
And so they would celebrate the birthday and
all the bears were invited you see, for that.

236
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:56,477
It’s so funny, isn’t it, that
children should be given such ideas?

237
00:23:56,488 --> 00:24:03,675
Because there’s no rapport. If the parents have a rapport with children, children won’t need so much.

238
00:24:03,674 --> 00:24:10,394
You must read some proper stories to
be told to children, talk to them.

239
00:24:10,404 --> 00:24:15,634
If you keep company with them, I don’t
think they’ll ask for toys, too many toys.

240
00:24:15,664 --> 00:24:20,924
They would not. They’ll be very satisfied,
because most of them are realised souls.

241
00:24:20,909 --> 00:24:30,295
So talk to them in such a manner that they develop their spirituality rather than all these materialistic things.

242
00:24:32,795 --> 00:24:37,575
I have found that we don’t spend
much time with our children.

243
00:24:37,589 --> 00:24:39,825
That’s why they are like this.

244
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:45,654
We had such a problem. I was telling you about
these wise children we had in our school there.

245
00:24:45,664 --> 00:24:51,828
The teachers were mad. They didn’t know what to do.They said, "Within one month's time, we will give up."

246
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:54,339
They said, "We can't do this any more."

247
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:08,230
The relationship between the child and parents
should be very sensible and of respect.

248
00:25:08,216 --> 00:25:16,869
Because I have seen that children go on
asking questions, “Why? Why?” like that.

249
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,380
You see, it’s kind of an
aggressive nature, that’s all.

250
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:23,470
They don’t want to know anything.
Just go on asking questions.

251
00:25:23,476 --> 00:25:29,902
At that time you have to tell them, “You are not to know this. There’s no need for you to know.”

252
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:32,410
You have to shut them down.

253
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:38,706
The quieter child is much
better, who observes, who learns.

254
00:25:38,706 --> 00:25:44,757
But the one who is aggressive becomes
later on a very wild personality.

255
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:47,527
So to see that your child is not aggressive.

256
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:51,947
They are exhausting. These
children are absolutely exhausting.

257
00:25:51,943 --> 00:25:55,068
This time I went to Rome.

258
00:25:58,178 --> 00:26:03,138
And I bought some sweets for them.

259
00:26:03,148 --> 00:26:05,648
Some chocolates.

260
00:26:05,658 --> 00:26:15,983
So when I sat down I said, "Now these
children, some lollipops and chocolates."

261
00:26:15,996 --> 00:26:18,496
So they all rushed on to Me,

262
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:22,112
pushing their hands like this.

263
00:26:22,146 --> 00:26:25,552
I said, "This is not to be done, you
are not beggars. Are you beggars?"

264
00:26:25,552 --> 00:26:27,812
Then they sat back.

265
00:26:27,832 --> 00:26:29,462
They are not beggars.

266
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:33,912
But say in India you try this, no
child will push forward this way.

267
00:26:33,922 --> 00:26:37,242
If you try to give he’ll feel
shy, he’ll look at the mother.

268
00:26:37,232 --> 00:26:47,511
Should he take it or not? But this comes only
because of the rapport we have with children.

269
00:26:47,507 --> 00:26:52,361
How do we have rapport with them?

270
00:26:52,376 --> 00:27:00,025
See now, you take them to the nature
here and see them, how they behave,

271
00:27:00,045 --> 00:27:03,195
what is their style,

272
00:27:03,203 --> 00:27:05,970
what is their treatment?

273
00:27:05,993 --> 00:27:10,960
Instead of making them
run about like mad

274
00:27:10,977 --> 00:27:16,683
or taking out some flowers or doing
some sort of an aggressive act,

275
00:27:16,693 --> 00:27:19,723
just make them sit down. Tell
them, “Now what is this flower?

276
00:27:19,733 --> 00:27:22,233
Do you know the name of this flower?

277
00:27:22,233 --> 00:27:25,006
Now this one, do you know what is that flower?"

278
00:27:25,014 --> 00:27:30,936
I mean many parents don't know themselves.
I don't know if they can explain.

279
00:27:30,953 --> 00:27:33,453
Then, "What is this tree?"

280
00:27:33,453 --> 00:27:34,996
Look at the nature.

281
00:27:35,003 --> 00:27:39,564
Put the attention of the
children on to something

282
00:27:39,573 --> 00:27:45,584
which will make them more
contented and more deeper.

283
00:27:45,583 --> 00:27:49,711
Instead of that, as soon as they see
the space they just start running.

284
00:27:49,724 --> 00:27:51,906
You don’t know what to do with them.

285
00:27:51,904 --> 00:27:57,746
It is because you have not taught them how to be concentrated on something very interesting.

286
00:27:57,746 --> 00:28:01,564
Now see, I am sitting here. I am
seeing, watching these stones.

287
00:28:01,566 --> 00:28:03,776
Even this will be in My head.

288
00:28:03,786 --> 00:28:07,630
What a beautiful fibre this is!

289
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:12,170
This is nature. And if once children start appreciating it,

290
00:28:12,167 --> 00:28:18,790
their attention will be more on this
than on something nonsensical, you see.

291
00:28:32,021 --> 00:28:38,563
So a rapport needs to be established
and an understanding of the children.

292
00:28:38,586 --> 00:28:43,023
An appreciation when they do
something good, you must appreciate.

293
00:28:43,053 --> 00:28:47,373
And when they are doing something, mostly they
do wrong things just to attract your attention.

294
00:28:47,373 --> 00:28:54,601
If you don’t pay any attention to that  just distract
their attention, to something else, it’s very easy.

295
00:28:54,627 --> 00:29:01,305
For example, now if you are going to somebody’s
house, the children are going with us;

296
00:29:01,335 --> 00:29:05,785
before going we tell them, “See now,
you have to behave there properly,

297
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:09,165
otherwise they’ll think that your parents are no good.

298
00:29:09,171 --> 00:29:15,634
Now we go there. You should not,
in no way try to misbehave.

299
00:29:15,634 --> 00:29:18,814
Shouldn't ask for anything. Just keep quiet."

300
00:29:18,815 --> 00:29:22,317
So first of all, you tell them how to behave.

301
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:27,317
Now when they go there and they behave properly when you come back, you have to tell them,

302
00:29:27,315 --> 00:29:31,397
“This is tremendous. You have been so good.

303
00:29:31,376 --> 00:29:38,168
You behaved so well, it's really very good I'm so
proud of you. So next time even better.

304
00:29:41,773 --> 00:29:50,645
Then you have to tell them about
their dignity, about what they are.

305
00:29:50,646 --> 00:29:53,525
And also the dignity of the nature.

306
00:29:53,546 --> 00:30:00,165
“See how dignified the tree is. How it
is standing there for giving us shade.”

307
00:30:00,185 --> 00:30:10,695
So they develop that feeling within them. If you do not have feeling for the nature, you cannot stop these ecological problems.

308
00:30:10,723 --> 00:30:13,223
That's important, very important.

309
00:30:16,483 --> 00:30:21,401
Luckily, with Sahaja Yoga,
Hamid has done some research

310
00:30:21,399 --> 00:30:27,900
and he has worked on the trees near Austria.

311
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:37,296
here’s a very beautiful mountainous area, much
higher than this, between Germany and Austria.

312
00:30:39,157 --> 00:30:43,447
There used to be some sort
of wasps, were really fatal.

313
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:54,021
Now they have all disappeared and the trees are
crumbling down with this acid rain and getting
completely destroyed.

314
00:30:54,021 --> 00:30:58,364
So the government asked him to
do some experiment with them.

315
00:30:58,372 --> 00:31:07,172
So, he took My vibrated water in a puja and he mixed
it with other water, put it everywhere.

316
00:31:07,176 --> 00:31:15,544
So he said, “All the trees about
sixty years of age didn’t react much.

317
00:31:15,556 --> 00:31:25,292
But below that, they all reacted
and they started looking healthier.”

318
00:31:25,312 --> 00:31:27,812
But he said still, the speed was not there.

319
00:31:27,812 --> 00:31:34,631
So there were lots of these
badges from America left over

320
00:31:34,683 --> 00:31:38,671
So he went and pushed them into every tree.

321
00:31:38,686 --> 00:31:47,526
And he said, “I went there after six months
and the whole thing was changed, vibrated
and it's all green, so beautiful.

322
00:31:49,514 --> 00:31:52,654
It’s a remarkable thing to happen.

323
00:31:53,704 --> 00:32:00,724
So I think My picture must be giving
balance or something to this acid rain,

324
00:32:00,742 --> 00:32:08,552
or it nourishes trees. The vibrations after
all, vibrations do nourish everything,

325
00:32:08,562 --> 00:32:11,062
and I don’t know what happened to the acid rain.

326
00:32:12,832 --> 00:32:15,332
It’s very different.

327
00:32:16,902 --> 00:32:24,104
We can try that everywhere,
vibrated water and these badges.

328
00:32:24,124 --> 00:32:28,144
Even the rings have done great works.

329
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:32,974
He had a problem because they don’t
have well as we have in India.

330
00:32:33,001 --> 00:32:46,496
They only have those taps. So he removed the joining ring and put his ring inside that, and then he joined it.

331
00:32:46,514 --> 00:32:53,520
With that ring only, it worked
wonders, can you imagine?

332
00:32:53,511 --> 00:32:55,159
Water was passing through it.

333
00:32:55,165 --> 00:32:57,665
Just imagine.

334
00:32:59,217 --> 00:33:07,716
Maybe the ring was emitting the vibrations and the water which went over it carried the vibrations.

335
00:33:07,716 --> 00:33:11,463
Unbelievable things have happened. Unbelievable!

336
00:33:14,003 --> 00:33:27,399
So for us it is important to understand what
is our status and what is our position.

337
00:33:27,389 --> 00:33:29,889
We are something very different from others.

338
00:33:29,889 --> 00:33:33,909
We have so much capacities.

339
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:45,205
So we must understand what we can do to
really improve the conditions around us,

340
00:33:45,205 --> 00:33:47,705
our children, everything

341
00:33:47,705 --> 00:33:53,555
because now you have that
vital force which you can use.

342
00:33:53,567 --> 00:33:58,866
But many Sahaja yogis are such, they do not understand

343
00:33:58,876 --> 00:34:06,936
that Sahaja Yoga is not for only for your
personal cleanliness or for your personal ascent,

344
00:34:06,958 --> 00:34:14,645
but for the ascent of the whole
universe, of the whole people.

345
00:34:14,655 --> 00:34:17,795
Anywhere there’s a Sahaja yogi you can make it out.

346
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:28,396
Once I was going in a village and I saw a
beautiful, very beautiful field of corn.

347
00:34:28,406 --> 00:34:35,051
Such beautiful corn, such thick, thick seeds in it.

348
00:34:35,051 --> 00:34:37,551
So I said, "Whose field?"

349
00:34:37,551 --> 00:34:40,859
I asked the Sahaja yogi, I said, "Whose field is this?"

350
00:34:40,867 --> 00:34:43,367
He said, "This is mine."

351
00:34:45,237 --> 00:34:54,217
"What did you do?" "I just got one coconut
vibrated by You and put it my well."

352
00:34:56,987 --> 00:34:59,648
All these miracles are happening.

353
00:34:59,669 --> 00:35:05,838
Something, when I was building Pratishthan
you see, we didn’t have water or well there.

354
00:35:05,863 --> 00:35:08,868
So the neighbour said, “My well
is lying here, you can use it,

355
00:35:08,891 --> 00:35:12,194
but it only can work for a few days.

356
00:35:12,214 --> 00:35:15,934
You'll have to arrange for water to build the house.

357
00:35:15,954 --> 00:35:18,734
I said, “All right.”

358
00:35:18,725 --> 00:35:27,200
So the first thing Sahaja yogis did was to put
My vibrated water in that well and one coconut.

359
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:39,562
Suddenly that well started. And while building, you see there’s a big ball kept there, to suck the water up.

360
00:35:39,562 --> 00:35:43,422
The ball was hanging in the air,
but still the water was coming.

361
00:35:43,439 --> 00:35:48,292
And the whole of that Pratishthan was built with that water.

362
00:35:48,292 --> 00:35:54,295
We never had to buy any water and
everybody was amazed. How can it be?

363
00:35:54,295 --> 00:36:02,208
But the water from, I don’t know from
where that source, but just sucked in.

364
00:36:02,228 --> 00:36:06,318
Till we finished the house,
there was water in that well.

365
00:36:06,347 --> 00:36:12,558
Then the fellow said, “I want this
well for my own use."  He'll use it for himself.

366
00:36:12,594 --> 00:36:15,094
Immediately it dried up.

367
00:36:15,094 --> 00:36:17,164
Touched the bottom.

368
00:36:17,174 --> 00:36:20,004
So he came to Me and he said, "I
don't know what has happened.

369
00:36:20,034 --> 00:36:22,804
There's no water, not a drop."

370
00:36:22,838 --> 00:36:25,338
I said, "Really?"

371
00:36:25,338 --> 00:36:28,288
"It's dried out."

372
00:36:28,318 --> 00:36:34,088
So I said, "All right, you take one coconut."
He said,"Your coconut is lying there."

373
00:36:34,117 --> 00:36:39,510
I said, "Take another one." It wouldn't.
He took another one, it wouldn't

374
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:44,810
Then I said, "All right, you get your
realisation." We gave him realisation, this that.

375
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:48,099
Then he said, "I would like to sell this well to You."

376
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:50,630
He sold it to Me, again the water came in.

377
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:58,362
Poor fellow, now he didn’t know what to do with
that. So we bought that well. Hari knows about it.

378
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:03,532
We bought that well and now
that well is again all right.

379
00:37:03,523 --> 00:37:09,225
So the nature is a great friend of Sahaja
yogis. This is what I am trying to say.

380
00:37:09,236 --> 00:37:11,956
Whatever you want, it will work out for you.

381
00:37:11,976 --> 00:37:14,476
See how the rain came.

382
00:37:15,526 --> 00:37:18,026
Least expected at this time.

383
00:37:18,026 --> 00:37:23,476
You needed it and when I was in the plane
only, I saw all the thundering going on.

384
00:37:25,969 --> 00:37:43,416
In Perth, when we went to the place where they have built a very beautiful cottage, it was all parched and all brown.

385
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,406
When I came it was all green, absolutely green.

386
00:37:47,417 --> 00:37:56,240
They said in the newspaper it was, it’s a very
rare thing that such a rain has come at this time.

387
00:37:56,236 --> 00:38:01,600
People don’t remember. Frank told me he doesn’t remember his lifetime that rain was there.

388
00:38:01,596 --> 00:38:06,778
But what a rain, it was torrential. It was torrential.

389
00:38:06,792 --> 00:38:10,583
So then he was worried, Stephen was worried

390
00:38:10,583 --> 00:38:13,463
that, “Mother I know, but the rain may stop

391
00:38:13,473 --> 00:38:15,571
people coming to the program.”

392
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:18,093
I said, “No, you’ll see that.”

393
00:38:18,093 --> 00:38:21,403
When we reached there, it was all full.

394
00:38:21,403 --> 00:38:24,663
And the people were seekers whom we had.

395
00:38:24,673 --> 00:38:27,173
And when I asked them, “Have you any questions?”

396
00:38:27,173 --> 00:38:29,963
No questions.

397
00:38:29,963 --> 00:38:33,333
They just wanted their realisation.

398
00:38:33,343 --> 00:38:39,995
So we could get the seekers,
absolutely who wants realisation.

399
00:38:40,001 --> 00:38:45,130
And we got the rain as well. So
rain has done double work for us.

400
00:38:51,692 --> 00:38:54,192
Are we all going to have lunch here?

401
00:38:57,672 --> 00:39:01,762
We are going to the park down by the lake. The park we travelled to.

402
00:39:01,762 --> 00:39:04,262
There we have to go?

403
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:09,362
We should go now, because talks cannot fill your bellies.

404
00:39:14,232 --> 00:39:16,732
CUT IN VIDEO

405
00:39:16,732 --> 00:39:22,002
Once we were going in the car and when I got down,
one of the Sahaja yogis said there was a Garuda.

406
00:39:22,002 --> 00:39:26,592
Couldn't see it. See Mother, see, there is a Garuda.

407
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:30,008
Got out from the car and I looked up.

408
00:39:30,005 --> 00:39:38,554
Really, there was a cloud just like a Garuda going sideways. Just like a Garuda!

409
00:39:38,554 --> 00:39:44,024
You see, on the way I never saw this gentleman. (unclear

410
00:39:44,054 --> 00:39:47,491
It’s beautiful and they photographed it.

411
00:39:54,401 --> 00:40:01,194
You haven’t seen a photograph of Mine in Brahmapuri?

412
00:40:01,216 --> 00:40:05,784
You’ve seen that one? He must have
shown you, Yogi had it with him.

413
00:40:05,784 --> 00:40:11,324
Where with the rainbow, My face is there.

414
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:15,844
Must get copy of all these, I think.

415
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:18,320
I think we have got a copy of that here in Australia.

416
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:21,886
You have? And the one in which, in a photograph…

417
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:23,806
 Oh, that’s an amazing photograph

418
00:40:23,816 --> 00:40:26,316
That you haven’t got. You’ve got that?

419
00:40:26,316 --> 00:40:30,766
 We got one in India. That is an amazing photograph.

420
00:40:32,482 --> 00:40:44,234
It’s the one of Ganesha. With the flare of the light from the camera, it’s created a complete Ganesha in the glass of the photograph.

421
00:40:44,226 --> 00:40:52,778
What surprises Me how at that
right moment you see these.

422
00:40:56,695 --> 00:40:59,195
How at that right moment they
take the photograph.

423
00:41:04,487 --> 00:41:09,700
Must be something, some sort of a communication, because nobody takes photograph of a rainbow.

424
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:18,758
The first photograph that appeared in the sky, they told Me there was a funny thing happening in the sky.

425
00:41:18,751 --> 00:41:21,251
I said, “What happened?”

426
00:41:21,251 --> 00:41:28,057
First one cloud became very bright, (full of vibrations ?)

427
00:41:28,044 --> 00:41:35,587
and it started forming a shape of Ganesha, so we took the photograph.

428
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:42,058
 And then from there, lots of rays sort of going on the sides.

429
00:41:42,068 --> 00:41:48,494
And when the whole thing disappeared, then the peace came down.

430
00:41:51,324 --> 00:42:02,418
But so to attract that attention also, I’m sure this Paramchaitanya must be working some tricks,

431
00:42:02,438 --> 00:42:06,678
otherwise how at the right time you take the photograph.

432
00:42:08,552 --> 00:42:13,828
Yes because, so many photos are taken..

433
00:42:15,214 --> 00:42:17,714
Some get the thing.

434
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:26,232
In one photograph Ganesha is just standing
behind Me. Absolutely. His blue body and eyes.

435
00:42:26,248 --> 00:42:31,012
 But one can doubt it. One can think that
it’s a stuff one kept there or something.

436
00:42:31,003 --> 00:42:32,872
I mean, if you have to talk.

437
00:42:32,872 --> 00:42:36,902
But this one is too much to have a photograph.

438
00:42:39,703 --> 00:42:43,893
This Paramchaitanya is trying all
tricks to convince you about Me.

439
00:42:43,898 --> 00:42:46,625
We are already convinced, you see.

440
00:42:46,645 --> 00:42:50,905
 But I don’t know about the world at large.

441
00:42:50,905 --> 00:42:55,075
They’ll sit down and find out, this is this, this is this.

442
00:42:55,921 --> 00:43:01,581
You know the famous photo series of the
rays of light, You know that very old one.

443
00:43:01,581 --> 00:43:06,411
There was somebody taking a photograph
at the same time, and it wasn’t on it.

444
00:43:06,397 --> 00:43:10,548
There are so many like that.

445
00:43:10,533 --> 00:43:14,557
In Calcutta you see, they were taking My photographs

446
00:43:14,557 --> 00:43:20,338
 and Talwar’s daughter-in-law just prayed, “Mother, I want to have some miraculous photograph.”

447
00:43:20,338 --> 00:43:24,138
So the sun and moon both appeared behind Me.

448
00:43:36,958 --> 00:43:42,083
The photographs where there are angels and
you see all the deities sitting behind Me

449
00:43:42,102 --> 00:43:47,943
was taken by a boy who was in first year medicine.

450
00:43:47,951 --> 00:43:52,175
Brought it to Me. He said, “I don’t
know what’s wrong with my camera.

451
00:43:52,186 --> 00:43:56,835
I don’t know what has come out is this.”

452
00:43:56,835 --> 00:44:01,716
He said, “Mother, I am sorry. You see, I don’t
know. Just this funny thing has come out,

453
00:44:01,717 --> 00:44:04,217
You see, the thing I can’t understand.”

454
00:44:04,213 --> 00:44:05,767
Wanted to take My photograph,

455
00:44:05,767 --> 00:44:09,900
I have come up so little as that
and all the deities sitting there.

456
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:13,900
He couldn’t understand that how it happened.

457
00:44:13,899 --> 00:44:18,759
And he had lots of them, one after
another, which you have seen all of you.
