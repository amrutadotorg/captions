1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:05,330
You develop a hypertension, you become very
agitated, you start dancing and doing all

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:06,440
kinds of things.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:11,410
These things can happen – that you may start
dancing, jumping, shouting, doing all kinds

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:13,599
of things, getting into licentiousness, permissiveness.

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,540
Because that’s how you are let loose.

6
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:22,220
The control on your being of the wisdom is
lost, and then you just get into it.

7
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:28,030
And you don’t feel the pinch of your conscience.

8
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:32,850
The pinch of the conscience is no more.

9
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:38,180
You just go arbitrary and you just shoot off.

10
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,280
It can happen to people even without feeling
this.

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,309
Even without feeling this some people can
get into that kind of a mood.

12
00:00:45,309 --> 00:00:51,379
That’s how they become alcoholic and they
become all these things where they have no

13
00:00:51,379 --> 00:00:52,379
control.

14
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:53,379
(break in recording)

15
00:00:53,379 --> 00:00:58,370
…eventually he was absolutely on [his] deathbed
because he got cirrhosis of the liver and

16
00:00:58,370 --> 00:00:59,469
he was going to die.

17
00:00:59,469 --> 00:01:06,272
He had left Sahaj Yoga, he wanted to do it
on his own and all that, and he just lost

18
00:01:06,272 --> 00:01:07,272
it, poor thing!

19
00:01:07,272 --> 00:01:08,280
Within three months he started showing results.

20
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,980
And he was so badly off and I brought him
home.

21
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,983
My husband had gone abroad and when he came
back he said, “What’s this?

22
00:01:12,983 --> 00:01:15,380
You have got a dead person in the house!

23
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,850
They are going to prosecute us, we are all
going to be in jail.

24
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:21,800
He’s going to die next moment the way he
is.

25
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,030
I just can’t look at him!”

26
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,030
He was very angry.

27
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,500
I said, “Now where can I send him?

28
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,010
After all, he’s so sick, it would be very
inhuman to send him anywhere out."

29
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:33,080
He said, “All right, tomorrow you arrange
something and send him away."

30
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:37,050
But next day you see when my husband got up
from his bed he saw this gentleman walking

31
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,050
about.

32
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,050
He was so surprised and aghast!

33
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,690
He came in and he said, “The fellow is out,
out of his bed!

34
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:44,110
I just can’t believe my eyes."

35
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:47,120
And then within seven days he was completely
cured.

36
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:52,050
But then Gus told me that, “Mother, some
of us are so egotistical that we have to go

37
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:55,750
to that limit to know you and to come to you.

38
00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:00,510
It’s not possible for some people to give
up their ego and to behave in this manner,

39
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:04,770
so you better allow them to go to that position
and then to come back."

40
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,010
I said, “For a Mother it is difficult.

41
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:09,619
She will try to tell them again and again
that, no, no, you try to get all right."

42
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:10,830
So, that’s what he told me.

43
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,850
But this is very true.

44
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:15,890
You see, what I have found with the Western
people is that they are really egotistical

45
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:20,980
in the sense that they, they don’t mind
killing themselves.

46
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:26,340
The ego is so self-destroying that they know
that they are unkind to themselves but to

47
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,040
just satisfy their ego, they’ll go on destroying
themselves.

48
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,880
And they reach such a funny point that you
just can’t understand how they have been

49
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,370
so foolish about it.

50
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,360
Then he started respecting himself and then
he went to his mother.

51
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,160
He said, “I feel tremendous love for my
mother!”

52
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,810
Whom he had left for years.

53
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,060
He never bothered about her.

54
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,060
Then he went down [to Australia].

55
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,500
Now he’s in Australia looking after his
mother and he’ll be coming back to London.

56
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,530
I am sure he’s much better off.

57
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,160
He writes very sweet letters.

58
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,990
So this is what is the thing of Mr.

59
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:59,599
Gus, who was the leader of all the hippies
of London and who was a very clever boy, and

60
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,020
he was a Physics professor.

61
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:06,209
And so you can imagine what can happen to
an egotistical person, how he can lose his

62
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:07,440
complete wisdom.

63
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:16,880
In Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan there were about
300 people out of which at least 275 people

64
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,640
were Indians.

65
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,870
And they were all suffering from some disease
or other.

66
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:24,599
I got such a fright and I was so angry with
all of them.

67
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:27,800
I said, “None of you are healthy to come
to me."

68
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:34,250
Some were suffering from paralysis, some were
suffering from gout and all kinds of troubles

69
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,250
they had.

70
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:40,170
And, in that lot I found Cooly sitting in
front of me and he was absolutely cool, very,

71
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:47,000
very cool: so much that he was like a frozen
dough.

72
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,530
And I felt him and I said, “Now this is
too much!”

73
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:55,849
But because of his heart catching you see.

74
00:03:55,849 --> 00:04:00,920
When your heart is caught up you can feel
that kind of coolness because it depresses

75
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,120
your heart more and you get that cool there.

76
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,020
So I called him Cooly.

77
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,020
And [Dr.

78
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:11,890
Denton] Cooley is one doctor whom you might
have heard about him, who is in Houston, where

79
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:15,440
they are operating small children, and I had
taken my grandchild there.

80
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,700
So I met him: He looked very much like our
Cooly, but he’s a very tall fellow; a very

81
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,370
kindly person.

82
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:26,350
And when I saw him I combined these two things
together because he’s was so cool and also

83
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,910
his face so much like Dr.

84
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:31,630
Cooley that I called him Cooly; and that’s
how [he got the name].

85
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:37,990
And then whenever he talked to me he said,
“You remember Mother, I’m Cooly speaking."

86
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:42,430
So his name became Cooly forever (laughter).

87
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,340
Now, come along.

88
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,510
His name is Anthony Panayiotou.

89
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:52,720
He is from Cyprus, very near Greece from where
Alexander the Great came to us.

90
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,270
And now comes ‘Cooly the Great’.

91
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:01,780
But I must also give the other side of the
picture.

92
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:06,020
The other side of the picture is that though
you people have one problem which I call as

93
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:10,930
the sin against the Mother, also Indians have
sin against the Father, which they do not

94
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,330
know.

95
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:16,940
In London you cannot imagine someone running
away with your chappals (Indian sandals) from

96
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:17,940
Caxton Hall.

97
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,720
Nobody can even think of such nonsense!

98
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,260
But here, how many of you have lost your chappals
in the programme?

99
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:27,010
And not only you but even yesterday, poor
Mr.

100
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:31,070
Pradhan lost his new shoe because where he
wore it for a function like that!

101
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:36,360
This kind of an absurdity is only possible
in this wretched India, where you get all

102
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,360
this kind of nonsense!

103
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:45,590
That’s the point where I really cannot understand
that people are so much worried and upset

104
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:50,290
about their belongings, about their things
and they want to grab anything that comes

105
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,060
in their way.

106
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,320
If they can do it without paying anything
for it, they’ll be very happy.

107
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,400
So, in this way we are really committing sins
against the Father, who has said that He is

108
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,560
going to look after the kshema (well-being)
also.

109
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,160
He looks after the kshema.

110
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,810
And while we do not believe into it that He
looks after it.

111
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,780
We get upset for a little money spent here.

112
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,190
We get upset for little things done there.

113
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:13,560
I mean we are really, that way, very, very
funny people.

114
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:20,479
Though Indians are very generous no doubt
but they do not mind taking away things without

115
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,700
the knowledge of the person who is around.

116
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,389
It’s something so funny!

117
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:28,261
Of course, everybody does not do it but quite
a lot of [them do].

118
00:06:28,261 --> 00:06:32,139
But especially the people who are at the helm
of affairs are absolute cheats sometimes and

119
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:35,380
are so funny that one can’t understand why
do they want to cheat?

120
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:38,430
I mean, they have everything, and they have
got a lot of money.

121
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:42,031
But they won’t mind taking away some money
away from you, taking away some money away

122
00:06:42,031 --> 00:06:43,190
from the other person.

123
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:47,500
For no rhyme and reason they will expect you
to give them money and bribes and things like

124
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,500
that.

125
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,410
So, this is something so surprising that in
London we have taken a flat, and now you know

126
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:53,410
we have taken a house.

127
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:56,740
We have taken a flat from one Indian and then
we took a house in London.

128
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:01,200
I didn’t have to pay any black money or
anything like that for taking this house and

129
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,270
it worked out very well.

130
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:08,050
But here it is not possible unless and until
you give them some black money and you do

131
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,150
all kinds of nonsensical things.

132
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,070
It’s very, very difficult!

133
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:13,610
Even in England Indians try this trick with
others.

134
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:19,570
If you remember our first flat fellow wanted
us to give him some money and wanted this

135
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,479
and that, and I had a big argument with him.

136
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:25,759
So, this kind of a nonsense which I call as
the sin against the Father is all the time

137
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:26,759
[there].

138
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:31,730
Even if they get a broken chappal somewhere,
they would carry it out.

139
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:37,490
I mean, all this kind of a thing is not possible
in London: people are very, very honest and

140
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:41,570
they don’t take somebody’s money like
that nor do they take away things.

141
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:45,980
Here if you have the kind of newspaper distribution
you have there, people will take away the

142
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,400
newspaper!

143
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:57,600
They will take away even the container of
the money and also the cash box and also the

144
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,370
lamppost!

145
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,590
And they can use it for any purpose.

146
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:06,520
Even I have seen people putting their bottles
out.

147
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:13,199
And everything, the way we have in London,
the postal system, they send anything to you

148
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,240
from thousands of rupees to any amount; nobody
takes it.

149
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,650
It is kept outside your house.

150
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:19,990
It is lying there.

151
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,259
Nobody takes it!

152
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:28,470
Especially in Oxted, a place of, so forlorn
and absolutely a desolate place and there

153
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:32,919
also I have seen [that] if something arrived
by parcel, it would be lying there for two

154
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:35,882
days, three days, if you were out and nobody
would touch it.

155
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:38,060
That is not possible here at all.

156
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:41,919
People would even take away locks you have,
they’ll take away the panels you have (Mother

157
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:42,919
laughs).

158
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:45,580
I mean, they can take away anything they feel
like.

159
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:55,140
Can you imagine in India people can even take
away a small, little tap that is hanging out!

160
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,860
From the bathrooms they’ll take away the
taps.

161
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:03,400
You allow them to go wash in your washbasin,
they may take away the washbasins!

162
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,310
Dustbins: they’ll take away your dustbins.

163
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,210
They can take away anything!

164
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:11,750
Like they are possessed by some people who
are thieves and thugs or I don’t know what!

165
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:16,750
Our gurus are just the same: they don’t
mind living on opium that is other people’s

166
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,750
money.

167
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,340
They indulge in other people’s money all
the time.

168
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,890
They have no shame about it.

169
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:25,140
And when I say anything about it people say,
“Mother, you are very hard on them!”

170
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,140
What should I say?

171
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:30,500
Should I garland them and make an aarti out
of them that: what thugs you are, very nicely

172
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,320
living on the people’s money?

173
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,900
I just can’t understand what one should
say.

174
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:39,330
I feel so ashamed of them, and responsible
also, the way they have really lynched all

175
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,360
the Western seekers.

176
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,500
And these are sadhus and they have no business
to do that!

177
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,990
And with that they have put all the bhoots
into them and have taken all that they had.

178
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:53,200
Even there are some people, one boy came to
me, he didn’t have a proper shoe on him,

179
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,260
and he’s the son of a Lord!

180
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:59,040
And he said, “Now my father has no place
for me because I stole some antiques from

181
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,510
his house and sold them to give it to this
fellow who’s now having an airstrip for

182
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,510
himself."

183
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,790
Is this the way?

184
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:09,720
To lynch people and take money from them and
befool them?

185
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,720
I mean, this is really shameful, absolutely
shameful.

186
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,240
And I am really ashamed of it.

187
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:21,120
So, though we are, in a way, naïve, because
we are not yet exposed to that kind of a sex-orientated

188
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,290
society: but it will take no time if we do
not stop it now with a complete force.

189
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:31,399
It will take no time for us to get into that
horrible, perverted thing, you see.

190
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:34,540
And the other day somebody asked me, “What
do you say to permissiveness and to licentiousness?”

191
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:39,870
So, I said, “In our Indian language, we
call it badmashi and badchalni."

192
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:42,100
This is the word we have got.

193
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,050
I mean we have no other sensible words for
these things.

194
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:47,000
They are called badchalni and badmashi.

195
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,630
This is the word we have got.

196
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,680
What am I to do?

197
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,800
I mean, can you suggest some new words for
permissiveness and licentiousness?

198
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,600
These are all horrid things!

199
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,910
And I mean, this is regarded as something
very bad.

200
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:04,790
So, this one can be twisted also, and people
can say that Mataji calls all the Westerners

201
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,790
badmash.

202
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:10,280
But if you are licentious, according to Indian
language, any language, in Marathi language,

203
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,589
we call it ‘gundgiri’ .

204
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:13,930
So, this is the word we use.

205
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:17,931
Now we haven’t got any word for a man like
that, to call him: you see, we do not call

206
00:11:17,931 --> 00:11:21,130
and enshrine people who are licentious here,
never!

207
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:23,310
We never enshrine people who are permissive.

208
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:29,390
But here, I don’t know how do you accept
it, that, “It’s a permissive society,

209
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,390
so what?”

210
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,760
“If it is a satanic society, so what?”

211
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,980
But satanic means you are Satans!

212
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,570
You have to say you are Satans.

213
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,590
Even if you don’t like my language, what
other words can I use?

214
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,590
You tell me.

215
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:43,060
Is there any other word that can really describe
them?

216
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:53,050
It is simply a very, very dilapidated state
of affairs and one has to accept it.

217
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,269
It’s horrible!

218
00:11:54,269 --> 00:11:57,070
It’s rotting the whole society there.

219
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:00,070
And we have to warn our people with very strong
words.

220
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:04,130
Even if people think that these words are
very, very strong, you should not mind telling

221
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:08,470
them that: “This is a very wrong thing that
you are doing in that country and one should

222
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,480
never do it, and one should never accept."

223
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,340
Because this may come here also and it’s
so shocking!

224
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:20,100
Today she was telling me something, Felicity,
and Zareen was there and she just couldn’t

225
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,100
understand anything.

226
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,410
She was so shocked she was perspiring.

227
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,950
Zareen, Zareen was there, and she was perspiring.

228
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,770
And she couldn’t understand how could she
stand all this nonsense?

229
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:30,230
No girl in India would stand this kind-of-a
nonsense.

230
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:34,180
[If] any man tries to touch her she will just
slap him nicely and put him right!

231
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:40,120
She knows what it means but you are so naïve
also about these things that you go on compromising

232
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:45,750
on these fundamental things and on certain
things, like putting on weight, you get so

233
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,750
upset.

234
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:50,920
You should be upset about losing your chastity
much more than about losing your weight and

235
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,880
things like that – it’s nothing important!

236
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,089
The priorities are so funny that sometimes
I just can’t understand.

237
00:12:57,089 --> 00:13:01,959
The main thing is, your chastity is the most
important thing that must be saved and should

238
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:04,779
not be allowed to be challenged by anyone
whatsoever!

239
00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:09,100
Women have given up [their] lives, they have
burnt themselves in this country, for saving

240
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,100
their chastity.

241
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,680
That’s the most important thing that they
want to save.

242
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:17,970
While there it’s so sex-orientated that
you have got ideas, also, about your figures

243
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:20,550
and things so that the body should be so attractive.

244
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:24,709
It’s more like prostitution, I feel, myself,
the way you are all the time paying attention

245
00:13:24,709 --> 00:13:27,200
to your body that you should be attractive
to others.

246
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,210
I mean this is something absurd and there
is no beauty in such things.

247
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:34,680
It is nothing but perversion of life, absolute
perversion.

248
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:39,360
You should try to remain in such a manner
that you are dignified.

249
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,899
Even the ideas are so much changed now.

250
00:13:40,899 --> 00:13:46,339
I think it’s much more satanic than anything
else, because if you see Mona Lisa, who is

251
00:13:46,339 --> 00:13:51,570
regarded as still the best painting, she was
a plump lady and nobody has any objection.

252
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:54,420
They pay such a lot of money just to see her
face!

253
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,160
While suddenly the ideas have changed!

254
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,770
I think a satanic force worked out to weaken
the women in this manner.

255
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:05,850
Because a woman who practices these things
becomes very weak, physically, and then people

256
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:09,250
can dominate them and can overtake them.

257
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:16,980
And that’s why these funny ideas about [weight]
reducing women and men and make them absolutely

258
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:23,810
slaves of these horrible satanic gurus and
things, have started, I think.

259
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:25,040
This is how they do it.

260
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,190
Perhaps it’s a very, very subtle way the
satanic [force] acts through putting these

261
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:29,190
ideas.

262
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:32,320
The other day only, a friend of mine had come
and she was telling me about her sister-in-law

263
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:40,800
who went into a drastic [weight] reduction
process, suddenly.

264
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,290
And I had met her about ten years back when
she started it and I told her, “What are

265
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,290
you doing?

266
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,290
You are looking so much older than your age.

267
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:48,600
You are looking at least ten years older already."

268
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,130
Now this lady told me, “Now she looks like
your mother!”

269
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,130
I said, “Really?

270
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:54,529
She’s so much younger to me in age."

271
00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:56,110
She said, “She looks so much like your mother."

272
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:58,240
Because thin people look so much older.

273
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,470
I have seen women of my age in England look
at least double my age.

274
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,630
I mean, they look like my mothers there.

275
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:08,610
Because of this kind of thing the whole body
shrivels up and also a little resistance that

276
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:11,972
is needed, or reserve that is needed, is not
there, and a balance in the body is not there.

277
00:15:11,972 --> 00:15:18,680
And it’s a very wrong thing to treat your
body so shabbily just to satisfy certain foolish

278
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,020
ideas that are all around.

279
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,089
Be kind to your body.

280
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:24,260
Don’t try to be very, very hard on this.

281
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,829
It works on your heart.

282
00:15:25,829 --> 00:15:26,980
You might get a heart attack.

283
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:30,720
You might get any kind of problems and it’s
a very wrong thing.

284
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,380
Don’t develop yourself in the lines which
are suggested in the West.

285
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:39,779
I have seen women who are so fidgety and so
irritatingly boring with their figures.

286
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:42,010
I don’t know how people marry with them!

287
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:43,081
That’s why you are having divorces also.

288
00:15:43,081 --> 00:15:45,850
You are having divorces.

289
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:50,880
The women who always go to dieting are a very
irritating type.

290
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,160
Actually, it’s a common thing.

291
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:58,959
You know that Brutus has described by Shakespeare,
as a thin man who was so irritatingly funny

292
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,180
that people never liked him.

293
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,820
He was always a complaining type.

294
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:06,209
So, one must understand, you must have a little
balance within yourself and don’t go all

295
00:16:06,209 --> 00:16:08,990
out for something that is so nonsensical.

296
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:15,980
And always after Sahaj Yoga you will find
our will have a body which will have a weight

297
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:20,120
because water is accumulated and you will
have a personality with that.

298
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,791
Otherwise, I have seen some ladies who reduced
themselves too much, and when they went to

299
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:29,820
England, one of them was the wife of a Cabinet
Secretary and she was taken as a secretary!

300
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:33,150
And, she was made to sit somewhere in the
corner.

301
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:35,200
And the gentleman came in and said, “Where’s
my wife?”

302
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,740
They said, “Your wife never came."

303
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,529
He said, “But my wife was here."

304
00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:40,580
So he said, “No, no, she’s never come."

305
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,880
He said, “But she was to arrive here earlier."

306
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,279
Then they said, “No, there’s only one
Indian lady who has come.

307
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:47,740
She’s sitting in the corner there."

308
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,690
And they said, “We thought she was your
secretary."

309
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:53,220
You see, a certain amount of dignity is needed.

310
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:59,030
And also, in India, also all of our Gods and
Goddesses have been like that, because it

311
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:03,720
gives you dignity, a contour and a personality
which is required.

312
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,530
Of course it should not be a hindrance to
you in anyway and should not be too much.

313
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:12,220
But the amount of fighting and quarrelling
[that] is going on among thin people is so

314
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,360
saddening that one wants to run away.

315
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:19,229
On the contrary, a person who laughs and is
relaxed always puts on weight.

316
00:17:19,229 --> 00:17:22,970
And what’s the use of making a mess out
of yourself that nobody can even stand you?

317
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,089
You’ll become like a thorn!

318
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:27,970
So, I would warn you that don’t go in for
these drastic things of [weight] reductions

319
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:28,970
and all that.

320
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:29,970
That’s not Sahaj.

321
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:32,580
Of course, you should not put on weight much,
then it’s different.

322
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,669
But don’t go in for drastic things.

323
00:17:34,669 --> 00:17:36,350
That is asahaja.

324
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:41,440
And don’t become like bamboos, because these
bamboos have no impression on people and people

325
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:53,559
must see you flowering like beautiful lotuses
and they should be blooming with health.

326
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:57,190
Because you know the Goddess is described
as Pushti is well-nourished.

327
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:00,429
A person should look well nourished.

328
00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:06,600
In London, when you walk, sometimes I feel
that half of these women who have no weight

329
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:11,090
might be lifted away by the breeze that is
coming and may be planted into something horrible!

330
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,580
It might be happening to some women.

331
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:15,350
And they are a very irritated type.

332
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:17,559
Extremely irritable temperaments they have.

333
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:20,840
And they are all the time complaining, complaining,
complaining.

334
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:25,080
We have some neighbours and I happened to
go to one of their meetings.

335
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,130
And I got so bored with them [that] I came
away.

336
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:31,049
And they didn’t know how to talk to each
other so they asked for drinks and started

337
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:34,960
drinking, because there was no other way out
from this kind of an irritated nature, the

338
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,179
way they were complaining to each other.

339
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:39,229
They got so tired of each other that they
said, “Let’s have some drinks."

340
00:18:39,229 --> 00:18:41,059
That’s the only way they can exist then.

341
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:46,419
So try to be very, very humorous and jolly
and happy people.

342
00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:47,619
Enjoy yourself.

343
00:18:47,619 --> 00:18:49,509
That’s the thing God has given you.

344
00:18:49,509 --> 00:18:52,070
And not try to become like Bombil machis!

345
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:55,519
You see, that is one thing I must tell you
[which] is very important.

346
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:59,990
Because that is something that will be very
wrong and will be asahaja.

347
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:03,539
Of course you should not be extremely fat
that you can’t move out.

348
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:04,539
You need not be.

349
00:19:04,539 --> 00:19:08,679
You will never be with Sahaj Yoga, because
if you get more fat it will be dissolved and

350
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:10,820
things will be this thing.

351
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:11,820
Now, what is the criteria?

352
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,820
What are we to know?

353
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:13,980
What sort of a weight is needed?

354
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:14,980
There’s no criteria.

355
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,549
We have to have different weights.

356
00:19:16,549 --> 00:19:18,101
We have to have different heights.

357
00:19:18,101 --> 00:19:19,101
We have to have different clothes.

358
00:19:19,101 --> 00:19:21,200
We have to be very, very different.

359
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,559
And variety brings the beauty.

360
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:27,379
If you have all of them put together in the
same way, the same forms, with the same dresses

361
00:19:27,379 --> 00:19:29,890
going round, you get so bored looking at them!

362
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:32,960
As if a machine has created all these people,
human beings.

363
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,629
There’s no sweetness about it.

364
00:19:34,629 --> 00:19:37,620
So, don’t try to play havoc with the nature.

365
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,620
Never try that.

366
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:42,429
Try to be attuned to the nature, attuned to
it.

367
00:19:42,429 --> 00:19:48,539
Because all such things create problems and
the first problem that is created is the liver.

368
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:53,609
So, be careful and don’t go into such haphazard
treatments.

369
00:19:53,609 --> 00:20:00,039
I would again request you, all of you, never
to go in for such drastic things, neither

370
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:03,279
in medicines nor in exercising yourself.

371
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:07,840
Because you know, with exercises, what happens
to your heart, we have seen it now.

372
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,849
And it’s very difficult to rectify it, so
be careful about it.

373
00:20:11,849 --> 00:20:14,999
And automatically you come down, you are normalised.

374
00:20:14,999 --> 00:20:17,600
And God knows how much weight you should have
and all that.

375
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,590
Now, those people who eat more may not put
on weight.

376
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,630
Those who eat less may put on weight.

377
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:23,630
It’s possible.

378
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:24,630
This happens.

379
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:27,099
So it depends on your temperament, whatever
are the requirements.

380
00:20:27,099 --> 00:20:28,849
And of course, you must keep a watch.

381
00:20:28,849 --> 00:20:33,980
But still I would say that one should not
try to do something of that kind.

382
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:37,240
On the contrary if somebody eats too much,
that means something is wrong.

383
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,539
If he eats too little also there’s something
wrong.

384
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:46,330
So you should eat a normal type of food and
lead a normal life.

385
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:49,529
And one type of food also one should not eat
– too much of one type of food.

386
00:20:49,529 --> 00:20:53,779
We should eat all kinds of food and try to
understand your own nature, what sort of a

387
00:20:53,779 --> 00:20:54,899
nature you have.

388
00:20:54,899 --> 00:20:58,599
And tomorrow I am going to give you a little
bit of Ayurveda, by which you will know what

389
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:03,630
is your nature and what sort of food you have
to have and how you have to be a normal person.

390
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,179
May God Bless you, now.

391
00:21:05,179 --> 00:21:06,120
So let’s have food.
