00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.680
for sahaja Yogi's now is very easy to

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:36.920
find out if something is real or unreal

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:40.690
it is truth or untruth it is love or

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:45.800
hatred only through vibrations you can

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:47.660
but going beyond - I am saying beyond

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:53.769
that one has to know what are these

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.769
vibration and what are they made of

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:14.740
what is the subtly subtle force which is

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:16.270
behind those vibrations we call it this

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:21.549
paramchaitanya all right but I'm saying

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:23.649
is over what happens to you when you get

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:27.670
paramchaitanya is something to be

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:33.219
understood the subtitles as I said we

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:35.049
are made of five elements right so when

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:37.539
you get your awakening when the

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:40.450
Kundalini reaches Ostara and opens out

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:43.450
your a fontanel bone area you become one

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:48.539
with the divine power then this divine

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.539
power itself starts flowing through a

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:55.569
connection is established now when she

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:59.679
it starts flowing through you this

00:01:55.569 --> 00:02:04.030
Shakti it starts going through then what

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:08.429
happens the subtle part we should

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:12.239
understand the subtle part is like this

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:15.940
that these five elements we are made of

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:19.750
these vibrations gradually start

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.630
breaking into the circular form of which

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.560
they are made

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:31.299
so the first thing such a person has is

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:35.470
the breaks is he as it is said that what

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:39.130
is God said also in the Bible the word

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:47.349
is God now what is this word word is a

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:50.829
silent we can say silent commandment we

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:54.099
can call it like that but from that word

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:59.669
comes according to Indian philosophy is

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:59.669
another thing that we call as Bindu

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:09.819
or we can say a word becomes nada

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:17.739
is a sound and then it becomes the Bindu

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:21.340
means one one small dot frequency and

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:23.409
then from this dot you see all these

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:28.120
five elements start coming one after

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:37.900
another the first element that comes out

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:41.200
is light beige light the first element

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:48.280
that comes out so the essence of the

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:52.629
first element is light we call it age

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:56.950
stages is written of course in Sanskrit

00:03:52.629 --> 00:04:00.549
but we should understand that how the

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:04.209
light pervades sahaja yoga so much and

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:14.849
you see the light order everywhere so

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:23.099
the first element which is light and the

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:26.050
lights subtle thing is we can say

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:30.010
enlightenment you can see but

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:33.760
enlightenment has another meaning so we

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:37.449
can say stage stage for example a person

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:40.720
who gets realization has a face which is

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:45.550
very radiant so you can say the radiance

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:49.870
the radiance is the subtlety of the

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.699
light so this radiance starts showing on

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.669
your face

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:59.710
radiance start expressing itself and

00:04:54.669 --> 00:05:02.530
with that radiance people get impressed

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:05.289
and they start thinking something

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:08.349
special about this personality which has

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:10.870
radiance now you have seen my

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:13.860
photographs also wherever they are

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:20.680
many a times you find lots of lighter

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:23.770
that is nothing but the light in me is

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:27.100
giving radiance because the light

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:30.720
becomes subtler when the light becomes

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:34.960
subtler in me light light is one of the

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:40.350
elements when it becomes subtler then it

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:44.440
gives radiance and so this is the subtle

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:48.460
growth within you that takes place your

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:52.060
faces also starts shining they too have

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:56.830
radiance and they too have a kind of a

00:05:52.060 --> 00:06:00.550
different complexion I would say this

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:05.650
radiance is to be understood is the

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:10.480
subtle of the light of which we are made

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:14.800
right in the gross manner then after

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:17.710
this from the light comes the second

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:22.480
thing which we call as why you in

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:26.800
Sanskrit meaning the air so the air that

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:30.070
we have which is gross air what is the

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:33.790
subtle affair is this cool breeze that

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:39.310
you get the cool breeze is the subtle of

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:43.600
that air so the subtle of what you

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:47.860
understand as cool breeze is what we

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:51.910
call vibrations the subtle of that is

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:56.730
air which is a part and parcel of our

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:59.980
making so this cool breeze is the second

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:03.190
thing that you start getting subtler and

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:06.910
subtler when your growths take place all

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:09.460
these certain things start expressing

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:11.710
them it's not only that you get

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:16.120
vibrations but you get the cool breeze

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:18.420
and that is the subtle of air that has

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.420
been

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:27.020
then comes the water

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:30.819
we are also made of water what is the

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:30.819
subtle of water is

00:07:35.509 --> 00:07:41.559
sometimes English language you know

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:49.089
becomes little short of expression but

00:07:41.559 --> 00:07:49.089
they call it I mean which makes the skin

00:07:49.419 --> 00:08:00.460
hard skin soft the skin becomes softer

00:07:56.409 --> 00:08:07.789
this is another sign of a realized soul

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:13.729
that his there's something they use

00:08:07.789 --> 00:08:17.089
isn't it to soften the face but then a

00:08:13.729 --> 00:08:21.770
person who is a realized soul becomes

00:08:17.089 --> 00:08:27.129
very soft force very delicate when he

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:32.930
talks to somebody and his voice there is

00:08:27.129 --> 00:08:36.110
one or I should say there is cousin of

00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:40.370
near Pawnee Hindi maketh a Pawnee owner

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:44.269
there to have that flow what are the

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:47.480
flow and coolness of the water so that

00:08:44.269 --> 00:08:50.209
is the another subject thing that should

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:54.110
be expressed in your behavior on your

00:08:50.209 --> 00:08:57.889
skin on your dealings with others that

00:08:54.110 --> 00:09:02.240
you should be like the water which is

00:08:57.889 --> 00:09:06.709
mobile which is cooling which is

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:09.829
soothing which is cleansing so this also

00:09:06.709 --> 00:09:14.029
becomes a part and parcel of your being

00:09:09.829 --> 00:09:16.610
once you become a realized soul with

00:09:14.029 --> 00:09:21.860
this water you have also another thing

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:24.440
we call it as ugly means the fire so you

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:27.620
also have fire but is a very silent

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:29.680
right it doesn't burn anybody but it

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:32.540
burns all the wrong things within

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:34.970
whatever wrong things you have it burns

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:37.910
and it burns the wrong things in other

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:41.569
people's for example a person comes with

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:43.970
a great anger towards him what happens

00:09:41.569 --> 00:09:47.930
that this anger

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:51.830
become schooled up with a fire that is

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:57.140
there moreover a realized soul cannot

00:09:51.830 --> 00:10:00.890
get burnt fire cannot burn the burning

00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:04.910
cannot come to him it's very important

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:09.440
to understand also if you are doing

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:12.740
something wrong it may burn you but if

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:15.050
you are a good sahaja yogi and I should

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:18.830
say a perfect sir to be fire will never

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:21.710
burn we have an example of Sita ji that

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:25.940
she went into the fire perish nothing

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:28.220
burnt so this is what one has to

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:31.520
understand that once you get to the

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:35.800
subtleties of the fire so the fire and

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:41.030
the water both of them become sort of

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:41.690
divine for example the water which you

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:46.220
touch

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:49.040
what are you drain whatever you put your

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:52.640
hand in the water the water becomes

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:57.560
vibrated means what the subtlety of the

00:10:52.640 --> 00:11:01.280
water comes in it the coolness curing

00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:04.010
power also comes in that water so when

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:06.230
it becomes subtler all these powers

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:06.860
start showing which you can see for

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:12.110
yourself

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:16.550
you don't have to experiment then the

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:19.400
lastly is the Mother Earth its most

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:22.040
important is Mother Earth it's a

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:24.680
photograph you might see which was taken

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:26.600
in Russia in my daughter where the

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:28.420
Kundalini is in the mother earth that's

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:32.510
clear

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:35.390
it's there and it is the mother earth

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:38.600
which shows for example I have seen

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:41.570
flowers if you keep them in my room they

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:44.990
block blossom they can become very big

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:47.840
like that never people have seen such

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:49.490
big flowers sometimes they see I'm doing

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:53.190
nothing I am just sitting down and what

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:56.910
happens to the flowers see now there

00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:59.460
principle of the mother earth works the

00:11:56.910 --> 00:12:02.340
subtle mother earth phase works it's a

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:06.900
mother and that gives you all the

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:11.220
nourishment and makes you grow healthy

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:15.150
and this is how this subtlety works of

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:17.670
the mother earth mother earth is the one

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:20.790
who is a giver of birth through all

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:23.640
these flowers and all these trees and

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:27.390
all that but it also plays a big part in

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:31.560
us it's not only the mother earth that

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:33.630
exists without our connection and we do

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:35.850
not respect the mother earth we have

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:38.250
polluted it we have done all kinds of

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:40.410
things they remove the trees and you

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:44.250
have made a mess out of her but she's

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:46.860
our mother and so many subtle things of

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:52.320
this Mother Earth coming to us one of

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:55.260
them is gravity a person becomes very

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:59.870
attractive not in the physical sense but

00:12:55.260 --> 00:13:04.550
in the spiritual sense such a person

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:07.770
attracts others they feel attracted and

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:11.160
they feel that something special is

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:14.070
about this person this is one of the

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:16.050
quality of the mother earth she had not

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:20.820
kept us attracted we would have won

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:23.610
enough with her movement and also other

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:27.270
qualities of the mother earth also start

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:34.340
manifesting within us and we become very

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:38.100
I should say extremely tolerant patient

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:41.250
person tolerant condition extremely

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:43.830
tolerant and patient but if you are not

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:46.620
tolerant if you are hot-tempered and all

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:49.380
that that mother has principle has not

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:51.660
expressed it look at the mother at how

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:54.420
much she tolerates ever nonsense how

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:57.720
many wrong things we do against her but

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:59.760
still she tolerates only after

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.890
realization you are connected with

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:07.100
reality

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:10.340
and you can get the understanding of all

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:12.350
these subtleties working through you why
