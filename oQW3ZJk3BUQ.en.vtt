00:26.890 --> 00:32.680
for sahaja Yogi's now is very easy to

00:29.539 --> 00:36.920
find out if something is real or unreal

00:32.680 --> 00:40.690
it is truth or untruth it is love or

00:36.920 --> 00:45.800
hatred only through vibrations you can

00:40.690 --> 00:47.660
but going beyond - I am saying beyond

00:45.800 --> 00:53.769
that one has to know what are these

00:47.660 --> 00:53.769
vibration and what are they made of

01:07.270 --> 01:14.740
what is the subtly subtle force which is

01:11.109 --> 01:16.270
behind those vibrations we call it this

01:14.740 --> 01:21.549
paramchaitanya all right but I'm saying

01:16.270 --> 01:23.649
is over what happens to you when you get

01:21.549 --> 01:27.670
paramchaitanya is something to be

01:23.649 --> 01:33.219
understood the subtitles as I said we

01:27.670 --> 01:35.049
are made of five elements right so when

01:33.219 --> 01:37.539
you get your awakening when the

01:35.049 --> 01:40.450
Kundalini reaches Ostara and opens out

01:37.539 --> 01:43.450
your a fontanel bone area you become one

01:40.450 --> 01:48.539
with the divine power then this divine

01:43.450 --> 01:48.539
power itself starts flowing through a

01:48.630 --> 01:55.569
connection is established now when she

01:52.869 --> 01:59.679
it starts flowing through you this

01:55.569 --> 02:04.030
Shakti it starts going through then what

01:59.679 --> 02:08.429
happens the subtle part we should

02:04.030 --> 02:12.239
understand the subtle part is like this

02:08.429 --> 02:15.940
that these five elements we are made of

02:12.239 --> 02:19.750
these vibrations gradually start

02:15.940 --> 02:21.630
breaking into the circular form of which

02:19.750 --> 02:25.560
they are made

02:21.630 --> 02:31.299
so the first thing such a person has is

02:25.560 --> 02:35.470
the breaks is he as it is said that what

02:31.299 --> 02:39.130
is God said also in the Bible the word

02:35.470 --> 02:47.349
is God now what is this word word is a

02:39.130 --> 02:50.829
silent we can say silent commandment we

02:47.349 --> 02:54.099
can call it like that but from that word

02:50.829 --> 02:59.669
comes according to Indian philosophy is

02:54.099 --> 02:59.669
another thing that we call as Bindu

03:02.680 --> 03:09.819
or we can say a word becomes nada

03:05.769 --> 03:17.739
is a sound and then it becomes the Bindu

03:09.819 --> 03:21.340
means one one small dot frequency and

03:17.739 --> 03:23.409
then from this dot you see all these

03:21.340 --> 03:28.120
five elements start coming one after

03:23.409 --> 03:37.900
another the first element that comes out

03:28.120 --> 03:41.200
is light beige light the first element

03:37.900 --> 03:48.280
that comes out so the essence of the

03:41.200 --> 03:52.629
first element is light we call it age

03:48.280 --> 03:56.950
stages is written of course in Sanskrit

03:52.629 --> 04:00.549
but we should understand that how the

03:56.950 --> 04:04.209
light pervades sahaja yoga so much and

04:00.549 --> 04:14.849
you see the light order everywhere so

04:04.209 --> 04:23.099
the first element which is light and the

04:14.849 --> 04:26.050
lights subtle thing is we can say

04:23.099 --> 04:30.010
enlightenment you can see but

04:26.050 --> 04:33.760
enlightenment has another meaning so we

04:30.010 --> 04:37.449
can say stage stage for example a person

04:33.760 --> 04:40.720
who gets realization has a face which is

04:37.449 --> 04:45.550
very radiant so you can say the radiance

04:40.720 --> 04:49.870
the radiance is the subtlety of the

04:45.550 --> 04:50.699
light so this radiance starts showing on

04:49.870 --> 04:54.669
your face

04:50.699 --> 04:59.710
radiance start expressing itself and

04:54.669 --> 05:02.530
with that radiance people get impressed

04:59.710 --> 05:05.289
and they start thinking something

05:02.530 --> 05:08.349
special about this personality which has

05:05.289 --> 05:10.870
radiance now you have seen my

05:08.349 --> 05:13.860
photographs also wherever they are

05:10.870 --> 05:20.680
many a times you find lots of lighter

05:13.860 --> 05:23.770
that is nothing but the light in me is

05:20.680 --> 05:27.100
giving radiance because the light

05:23.770 --> 05:30.720
becomes subtler when the light becomes

05:27.100 --> 05:34.960
subtler in me light light is one of the

05:30.720 --> 05:40.350
elements when it becomes subtler then it

05:34.960 --> 05:44.440
gives radiance and so this is the subtle

05:40.350 --> 05:48.460
growth within you that takes place your

05:44.440 --> 05:52.060
faces also starts shining they too have

05:48.460 --> 05:56.830
radiance and they too have a kind of a

05:52.060 --> 06:00.550
different complexion I would say this

05:56.830 --> 06:05.650
radiance is to be understood is the

06:00.550 --> 06:10.480
subtle of the light of which we are made

06:05.650 --> 06:14.800
right in the gross manner then after

06:10.480 --> 06:17.710
this from the light comes the second

06:14.800 --> 06:22.480
thing which we call as why you in

06:17.710 --> 06:26.800
Sanskrit meaning the air so the air that

06:22.480 --> 06:30.070
we have which is gross air what is the

06:26.800 --> 06:33.790
subtle affair is this cool breeze that

06:30.070 --> 06:39.310
you get the cool breeze is the subtle of

06:33.790 --> 06:43.600
that air so the subtle of what you

06:39.310 --> 06:47.860
understand as cool breeze is what we

06:43.600 --> 06:51.910
call vibrations the subtle of that is

06:47.860 --> 06:56.730
air which is a part and parcel of our

06:51.910 --> 06:59.980
making so this cool breeze is the second

06:56.730 --> 07:03.190
thing that you start getting subtler and

06:59.980 --> 07:06.910
subtler when your growths take place all

07:03.190 --> 07:09.460
these certain things start expressing

07:06.910 --> 07:11.710
them it's not only that you get

07:09.460 --> 07:16.120
vibrations but you get the cool breeze

07:11.710 --> 07:18.420
and that is the subtle of air that has

07:16.120 --> 07:18.420
been

07:19.689 --> 07:27.020
then comes the water

07:23.030 --> 07:30.819
we are also made of water what is the

07:27.020 --> 07:30.819
subtle of water is

07:35.509 --> 07:41.559
sometimes English language you know

07:37.610 --> 07:49.089
becomes little short of expression but

07:41.559 --> 07:49.089
they call it I mean which makes the skin

07:49.419 --> 08:00.460
hard skin soft the skin becomes softer

07:56.409 --> 08:07.789
this is another sign of a realized soul

08:00.460 --> 08:13.729
that his there's something they use

08:07.789 --> 08:17.089
isn't it to soften the face but then a

08:13.729 --> 08:21.770
person who is a realized soul becomes

08:17.089 --> 08:27.129
very soft force very delicate when he

08:21.770 --> 08:32.930
talks to somebody and his voice there is

08:27.129 --> 08:36.110
one or I should say there is cousin of

08:32.930 --> 08:40.370
near Pawnee Hindi maketh a Pawnee owner

08:36.110 --> 08:44.269
there to have that flow what are the

08:40.370 --> 08:47.480
flow and coolness of the water so that

08:44.269 --> 08:50.209
is the another subject thing that should

08:47.480 --> 08:54.110
be expressed in your behavior on your

08:50.209 --> 08:57.889
skin on your dealings with others that

08:54.110 --> 09:02.240
you should be like the water which is

08:57.889 --> 09:06.709
mobile which is cooling which is

09:02.240 --> 09:09.829
soothing which is cleansing so this also

09:06.709 --> 09:14.029
becomes a part and parcel of your being

09:09.829 --> 09:16.610
once you become a realized soul with

09:14.029 --> 09:21.860
this water you have also another thing

09:16.610 --> 09:24.440
we call it as ugly means the fire so you

09:21.860 --> 09:27.620
also have fire but is a very silent

09:24.440 --> 09:29.680
right it doesn't burn anybody but it

09:27.620 --> 09:32.540
burns all the wrong things within

09:29.680 --> 09:34.970
whatever wrong things you have it burns

09:32.540 --> 09:37.910
and it burns the wrong things in other

09:34.970 --> 09:41.569
people's for example a person comes with

09:37.910 --> 09:43.970
a great anger towards him what happens

09:41.569 --> 09:47.930
that this anger

09:43.970 --> 09:51.830
become schooled up with a fire that is

09:47.930 --> 09:57.140
there moreover a realized soul cannot

09:51.830 --> 10:00.890
get burnt fire cannot burn the burning

09:57.140 --> 10:04.910
cannot come to him it's very important

10:00.890 --> 10:09.440
to understand also if you are doing

10:04.910 --> 10:12.740
something wrong it may burn you but if

10:09.440 --> 10:15.050
you are a good sahaja yogi and I should

10:12.740 --> 10:18.830
say a perfect sir to be fire will never

10:15.050 --> 10:21.710
burn we have an example of Sita ji that

10:18.830 --> 10:25.940
she went into the fire perish nothing

10:21.710 --> 10:28.220
burnt so this is what one has to

10:25.940 --> 10:31.520
understand that once you get to the

10:28.220 --> 10:35.800
subtleties of the fire so the fire and

10:31.520 --> 10:41.030
the water both of them become sort of

10:35.800 --> 10:41.690
divine for example the water which you

10:41.030 --> 10:46.220
touch

10:41.690 --> 10:49.040
what are you drain whatever you put your

10:46.220 --> 10:52.640
hand in the water the water becomes

10:49.040 --> 10:57.560
vibrated means what the subtlety of the

10:52.640 --> 11:01.280
water comes in it the coolness curing

10:57.560 --> 11:04.010
power also comes in that water so when

11:01.280 --> 11:06.230
it becomes subtler all these powers

11:04.010 --> 11:06.860
start showing which you can see for

11:06.230 --> 11:12.110
yourself

11:06.860 --> 11:16.550
you don't have to experiment then the

11:12.110 --> 11:19.400
lastly is the Mother Earth its most

11:16.550 --> 11:22.040
important is Mother Earth it's a

11:19.400 --> 11:24.680
photograph you might see which was taken

11:22.040 --> 11:26.600
in Russia in my daughter where the

11:24.680 --> 11:28.420
Kundalini is in the mother earth that's

11:26.600 --> 11:32.510
clear

11:28.420 --> 11:35.390
it's there and it is the mother earth

11:32.510 --> 11:38.600
which shows for example I have seen

11:35.390 --> 11:41.570
flowers if you keep them in my room they

11:38.600 --> 11:44.990
block blossom they can become very big

11:41.570 --> 11:47.840
like that never people have seen such

11:44.990 --> 11:49.490
big flowers sometimes they see I'm doing

11:47.840 --> 11:53.190
nothing I am just sitting down and what

11:49.490 --> 11:56.910
happens to the flowers see now there

11:53.190 --> 11:59.460
principle of the mother earth works the

11:56.910 --> 12:02.340
subtle mother earth phase works it's a

11:59.460 --> 12:06.900
mother and that gives you all the

12:02.340 --> 12:11.220
nourishment and makes you grow healthy

12:06.900 --> 12:15.150
and this is how this subtlety works of

12:11.220 --> 12:17.670
the mother earth mother earth is the one

12:15.150 --> 12:20.790
who is a giver of birth through all

12:17.670 --> 12:23.640
these flowers and all these trees and

12:20.790 --> 12:27.390
all that but it also plays a big part in

12:23.640 --> 12:31.560
us it's not only the mother earth that

12:27.390 --> 12:33.630
exists without our connection and we do

12:31.560 --> 12:35.850
not respect the mother earth we have

12:33.630 --> 12:38.250
polluted it we have done all kinds of

12:35.850 --> 12:40.410
things they remove the trees and you

12:38.250 --> 12:44.250
have made a mess out of her but she's

12:40.410 --> 12:46.860
our mother and so many subtle things of

12:44.250 --> 12:52.320
this Mother Earth coming to us one of

12:46.860 --> 12:55.260
them is gravity a person becomes very

12:52.320 --> 12:59.870
attractive not in the physical sense but

12:55.260 --> 13:04.550
in the spiritual sense such a person

12:59.870 --> 13:07.770
attracts others they feel attracted and

13:04.550 --> 13:11.160
they feel that something special is

13:07.770 --> 13:14.070
about this person this is one of the

13:11.160 --> 13:16.050
quality of the mother earth she had not

13:14.070 --> 13:20.820
kept us attracted we would have won

13:16.050 --> 13:23.610
enough with her movement and also other

13:20.820 --> 13:27.270
qualities of the mother earth also start

13:23.610 --> 13:34.340
manifesting within us and we become very

13:27.270 --> 13:38.100
I should say extremely tolerant patient

13:34.340 --> 13:41.250
person tolerant condition extremely

13:38.100 --> 13:43.830
tolerant and patient but if you are not

13:41.250 --> 13:46.620
tolerant if you are hot-tempered and all

13:43.830 --> 13:49.380
that that mother has principle has not

13:46.620 --> 13:51.660
expressed it look at the mother at how

13:49.380 --> 13:54.420
much she tolerates ever nonsense how

13:51.660 --> 13:57.720
many wrong things we do against her but

13:54.420 --> 13:59.760
still she tolerates only after

13:57.720 --> 14:00.890
realization you are connected with

13:59.760 --> 14:07.100
reality

14:00.890 --> 14:10.340
and you can get the understanding of all

14:07.100 --> 14:12.350
these subtleties working through you why

14:10.340 --> 14:15.680
I'm telling you this because I want you

14:12.350 --> 14:17.810
to know and recognize yourself to

14:15.680 --> 14:20.870
understand what you are what you have

14:17.810 --> 14:24.020
what once you recognize yourself and

14:20.870 --> 14:27.590
understand yourself you can do a lot I

14:24.020 --> 14:30.200
am here to give you self-realization and

amazed how you will be helped and how

14:52.490 --> 14:58.940
you they all get spontaneous and they

14:54.680 --> 15:01.430
work it out if you take to introspection
