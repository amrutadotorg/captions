00:00:01.131 --> 00:00:05.487
the creation of God is going to get its fulfilment

00:00:05.788 --> 00:00:08.704
and is going to know its meaning

00:00:09.123 --> 00:00:13.172
– it is that great! Perhaps we do not realise it,

00:00:13.592 --> 00:00:16.590
but when we say, “We are sahaja yogis,”

00:00:16.746 --> 00:00:20.570
you have to know that, to be a sahaja yogi,

00:00:20.761 --> 00:00:25.985
how much identified you should be with the Truth of Sahaja Yoga,

00:00:26.188 --> 00:00:30.584
and so many misidentifications which are hanging on to you

00:00:30.722 --> 00:00:33.091
must be got rid of.

00:00:33.646 --> 00:00:35.842
People call it a sacrifice.

00:00:36.382 --> 00:00:39.032
I do not think it is a sacrifice.

00:00:39.622 --> 00:00:43.341
If you think something is hampering your way

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:46.490
you try to take out that hurdle.

00:00:47.117 --> 00:00:51.672
In the same way, if you stand out from your obstructions,

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:55.445
you will be able to understand that these obstructions

00:00:55.615 --> 00:00:58.879
are standing in your way and they are not your own

00:00:59.097 --> 00:01:01.478
and that they are stopping your progress.

00:01:01.637 --> 00:01:05.576
So you should get this misidentification

00:01:06.363 --> 00:01:09.993
out of your minds completely and try to

00:01:10.208 --> 00:01:14.608
be more and more your Self and not a misidentification.

00:01:15.198 --> 00:01:19.186
This is one the problems, I think, people have here.

00:01:19.311 --> 00:01:22.744
Whenever I get any complaints or anything,

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.884
I understand that still the level

00:01:26.075 --> 00:01:30.710
of understanding about Sahaja Yoga is not up to that point.

00:01:31.016 --> 00:01:33.113
It is a tremendous task!

00:01:33.762 --> 00:01:38.430
And for that, if you are the people who have to come up

00:01:38.576 --> 00:01:40.955
and if you are the people who have to fight it,

00:01:41.103 --> 00:01:43.912
you have to understand it in its full extent

00:01:44.036 --> 00:01:46.649
and also understand where you stand for it:

00:01:46.846 --> 00:01:49.714
how much you have to do? how much you have to improve yourself?

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.849
Because you are the people who are going to take the Sahaja Yoga

00:01:53.963 --> 00:01:56.563
to that position where it has to reach

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.302
because as far as I am concerned, I have nothing to do anymore.

00:02:01.483 --> 00:02:02.763
I have done it.

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:04.873
Now it is for you to receive,

00:02:05.008 --> 00:02:06.904
you have to imbibe into it

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.400
and you have to change the whole thing;

00:02:09.616 --> 00:02:13.583
that is your job and that is why it is a serious matter.

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:17.969
The second point I always have been saying [is] that,

00:02:18.094 --> 00:02:21.983
due to ego problem, we are very much disintegrated.

00:02:22.153 --> 00:02:25.155
We are so disintegrated that the connection with the Divine

00:02:25.235 --> 00:02:27.099
is never properly established.

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:29.283
As I have said it, that this instrument (microphone)

00:02:29.374 --> 00:02:30.725
if it is divided into five parts

00:02:30.884 --> 00:02:33.478
and all the five parts are fighting with each other,

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.231
you cannot get anything done through this

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:39.234
instrument, through it is connected to the mains.

00:02:39.372 --> 00:02:42.850
In the same way if you still remain disintegrated

00:02:43.032 --> 00:02:45.165
you cannot get that connection.

00:02:45.333 --> 00:02:48.469
For example, people come down here, I have seen,

00:02:48.778 --> 00:02:52.018
for Sahaja Yoga; now they have other interests

00:02:52.127 --> 00:02:55.061
and there’s other priorities and other things are there

00:02:55.224 --> 00:02:56.627
which are very important for them.

00:02:56.696 --> 00:02:58.838
All the time, they are wasting their time for that,

00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:01.602
and then they will say that, “Mother, we are not progressing

00:03:01.716 --> 00:03:03.396
much in Sahaja Yoga.”

00:03:03.836 --> 00:03:06.384
If you decide, as  (Mr. Venugopalan) he has told you

00:03:06.464 --> 00:03:08.598
that, “We have to do Sahaja Yoga first

00:03:08.776 --> 00:03:10.635
and the other things are secondary,”

00:03:10.795 --> 00:03:14.699
then only the Sahaja Yoga can be really established into
you.

00:03:14.972 --> 00:03:17.588
We’ll have some Sahaja Yogis of a very high level,

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:18.719
I know that,

00:03:18.915 --> 00:03:21.193
and we will have some of very mediocre level,

00:03:21.296 --> 00:03:23.107
some will be absolutely useless

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.749
and some would be absolutely thrown away.

00:03:25.891 --> 00:03:27.340
We’ll have all types.

00:03:27.454 --> 00:03:31.678
That also I know. Now it is for you to decide: where do you come?

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:34.139
How far you are going to?

00:03:34.275 --> 00:03:36.157
If you are going to waste your time

00:03:36.271 --> 00:03:39.173
in thinking about other sahaja yogis and small, small things

00:03:39.264 --> 00:03:41.259
and trivial things as he has said it,

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:44.182
your disintegration is going to be increased,

00:03:44.284 --> 00:03:46.003
you are going to [be] separated much more

00:03:46.086 --> 00:03:48.963
because all this decision is taken through your ego:

00:03:49.054 --> 00:03:52.351
“I don’t like it, I don’t do it, I don’t see it.”

00:03:52.635 --> 00:03:55.963
If you could somehow or other see your ego working,

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:58.444
then you can get rid of it.

00:03:58.835 --> 00:04:02.396
And that is the thing one has to do; not to fight the ego.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.459
I never say, “Fight the ego!”

00:04:04.551 --> 00:04:08.233
But surrendering is the only way your ego can go.

00:04:08.743 --> 00:04:12.451
And that’s why the progress in the West, as you have seen it,

00:04:12.587 --> 00:04:16.725
is much less than it is in India.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.888
Now, take his case, I would say, particular case

00:04:19.993 --> 00:04:22.530
of [Mr. ] Venugopalan: he’s really remarkable

00:04:22.665 --> 00:04:26.653
because he is a man who is holding a very big position in India.

00:04:26.764 --> 00:04:31.602
Here I see, even if a person is a dishwasher

00:04:31.705 --> 00:04:33.178
[and] he comes to Sahaja Yoga,

00:04:33.292 --> 00:04:35.920
still his ego is so big [that] even our Prime Minister won’t

00:04:36.056 --> 00:04:37.961
have such a big ego as he has!

00:04:38.047 --> 00:04:41.831
I mean, the way he will talk that, “I don’t like it, I do this, this!”

00:04:41.911 --> 00:04:44.142
I am myself amazed the way people [talk]! You see,

00:04:44.233 --> 00:04:47.184
everybody has become the King of England or what?

00:04:47.297 --> 00:04:48.325
The way they talk!

00:04:48.421 --> 00:04:51.173
This is something one should tell people when they come here,

00:04:51.256 --> 00:04:55.494
that, “Don’t waste Mataji’s energies in arguing and this and that,”

00:04:55.596 --> 00:04:58.269
because everybody thinks no end of themselves here,

00:04:58.372 --> 00:05:01.047
and that is the biggest hurdle that they have,

00:05:01.127 --> 00:05:04.392
when they even come first time, you find it so difficult!

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:09.004
I have to show all my appreciation of their ego,

00:05:09.084 --> 00:05:12.947
all the time, just to satisfy them so that they come round.

00:05:13.061 --> 00:05:14.884
And this is how the progress becomes less.

00:05:14.963 --> 00:05:17.138
Now, in his case, (Venugopalan) he is a person

00:05:17.206 --> 00:05:19.950
who has been to all kinds of horrible ‘gurus’

00:05:20.063 --> 00:05:23.780
and his wife has been also to all kinds of horrible ‘gurus’

00:05:23.871 --> 00:05:26.396
because of another extreme in India we have,

00:05:26.488 --> 00:05:28.605
that we must respect all the saints.

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:30.941
But these days the saints are fake saints,

00:05:31.043 --> 00:05:34.136
not only fake saints, but some of them are devils!

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.198
So they are not going to say, “We are devils.”

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:41.185
When they do not say they are devils

00:05:41.288 --> 00:05:43.820
or whatever it is, they do not come in their proper form,

00:05:43.922 --> 00:05:46.125
these simple, innocent people, who are seeking God,

00:05:46.213 --> 00:05:50.283
just go to them, give their heart, do everything

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:52.775
and then they find that they are devils.

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:56.358
Once they discover they are devils, then they are surprised.

00:05:56.483 --> 00:05:59.240
Then they come back from there, they go to another guru,

00:05:59.371 --> 00:06:01.239
they go to another guru, but the harm is done.

00:06:01.342 --> 00:06:04.196
But they get rid of that harm because they recognise

00:06:04.287 --> 00:06:05.668
that harm has been done

00:06:05.736 --> 00:06:08.695
and they know, what is the Truth is, what is to expect.

00:06:08.809 --> 00:06:11.006
I would say it is the blessing of that country

00:06:11.086 --> 00:06:13.286
that people know what to expect.

00:06:13.376 --> 00:06:16.820
People would not like to go, those who are really

00:06:16.934 --> 00:06:19.223
of a very good quality people,

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:21.446
will not go to a man who shows

00:06:21.548 --> 00:06:23.711
some sort of a a sensationalisation

00:06:23.817 --> 00:06:27.125
or some sort of a chamatkar (चमत्कार) – is a

00:06:27.555 --> 00:06:29.506
miracle – they would not go,

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:32.510
but they will go to other subtler people, who are very cunning

00:06:32.601 --> 00:06:34.719
and they put up another kind of a show

00:06:35.396 --> 00:06:36.836
and just say that,

00:06:36.961 --> 00:06:39.682
“No, no, this is the way you can achieve the highest,”

00:06:39.842 --> 00:06:43.787
and that’s how most of the sahaja yogis in India also have been

00:06:43.901 --> 00:06:46.917
– except for the village people and the district people

00:06:47.042 --> 00:06:50.225
– most of the city people have been to some guru or someone.

00:06:50.328 --> 00:06:52.604
But despite all that, they have left everything.

00:06:52.683 --> 00:06:55.302
I have told them, “You have to beat them with shoes. ” They’ll do

00:06:55.382 --> 00:06:58.077
everything morning till…every day he does his sadhana (साधना)

00:06:58.157 --> 00:07:01.284
for one hour though he’s a very busy man.

00:07:01.488 --> 00:07:04.368
Here even to get up in the morning, people grudge. I mean,

00:07:04.433 --> 00:07:07.843
what can you do with such slow moving people? You see,

00:07:07.991 --> 00:07:10.124
it is absolutely very difficult!

00:07:12.064 --> 00:07:15.394
And this is what I feel that we must understand

00:07:15.509 --> 00:07:18.603
that we have a very great responsibility,

00:07:20.253 --> 00:07:23.039
very great responsibility in the West,

00:07:23.108 --> 00:07:25.976
because this has to happen in London,

00:07:26.103 --> 00:07:28.674
it has to happen in England to begin with,

00:07:28.844 --> 00:07:32.044
and that’s why you bear a very big responsibility.

00:07:32.165 --> 00:07:35.314
You have to evaluate yourself and you have to evaluate

00:07:35.472 --> 00:07:37.956
Sahaja Yoga, again and again and again.

00:07:38.047 --> 00:07:42.024
And know that what makes you slow is your ego

00:07:42.601 --> 00:07:46.956
–or even superego is there, no doubt – but ego is the main problem.

00:07:47.078 --> 00:07:49.207
I must tell you [that] ego is the main problem

00:07:49.321 --> 00:07:51.494
but I dare not say to anyone that, “This is your ego,”

00:07:51.575 --> 00:07:54.339
because that will just jump on to my head.

00:07:54.452 --> 00:07:56.132
But try to see your ego,

00:07:56.799 --> 00:08:00.605
how it is deviating, because it is your own joy you are seeking,

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.932
it is your own property you are seeking,

00:08:03.023 --> 00:08:05.415
it is your own that is hidden from you,

00:08:05.495 --> 00:08:08.238
for which you have been seeking for ages now;

00:08:08.352 --> 00:08:10.798
that is what I have to expose for you.

00:08:10.944 --> 00:08:12.778
What is there to argue with a person,

00:08:12.858 --> 00:08:14.853
who is trying to give you the highest?

00:08:17.455 --> 00:08:19.425
It’s just a waste of energy.

00:08:19.573 --> 00:08:21.555
Do not waste your energy onto these things,

00:08:21.668 --> 00:08:23.868
onto frivolous things, about finding faults.

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:27.303
Now he has been organising our Delhi Camp,

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.476
he is the one who has organised our printing of the book and all.

00:08:31.246 --> 00:08:34.165
I have not known any problems there.

00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:37.226
You just tell them that, “This has to happen,” “Alright!”

00:08:37.386 --> 00:08:39.452
I do not know how it works out.

00:08:39.633 --> 00:08:42.603
You have stayed in Delhi. You have seen how many people were there.

00:08:42.735 --> 00:08:46.164
Never a problem! Did you hear anybody complaining?

00:08:46.323 --> 00:08:49.775
Or anybody quarrelling or fighting among themselves?

00:08:49.872 --> 00:08:51.203
Nothing of the kind!

00:08:52.382 --> 00:08:55.384
You see, this is notthe sign of intelligence either;

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:58.966
of all the time trying to find faults with each other

00:09:00.204 --> 00:09:02.037
or trying to blame yourself.

00:09:02.197 --> 00:09:03.380
Both things are wrong.

00:09:03.519 --> 00:09:07.156
Best thing is to grow in wisdom,

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.120
we must grow in wisdom.

00:09:09.809 --> 00:09:13.585
We’ll, ourselves, see that we are becoming wiser and wiser.

00:09:14.842 --> 00:09:17.821
Some of you are really very grown up

00:09:18.365 --> 00:09:21.015
and some of you still go up and down,

00:09:21.151 --> 00:09:23.385
and some of you’re still very low.

00:09:23.487 --> 00:09:26.693
So all of us have to get up and all of us have to go together.

00:09:26.819 --> 00:09:29.018
If somebody has also achieved something it is of

00:09:29.154 --> 00:09:30.979
no use to Sahaja Yoga, as I have told you,

00:09:31.059 --> 00:09:34.299
it’s a collective thing that is going to work out.

00:09:34.469 --> 00:09:36.246
All of you have to work it out

00:09:36.372 --> 00:09:38.764
and it is so sweet that

00:09:39.252 --> 00:09:43.156
you have real brothers and sisters all over the world today.

00:09:43.661 --> 00:09:47.185
When you’ll go there with the full heart they are going to receive

00:09:47.311 --> 00:09:50.319
[you] as you have received him with full heart.

00:09:50.493 --> 00:09:53.778
But we all must come up! Come up to a point,

00:09:53.949 --> 00:09:57.038
where we can face each other with full love, with openness,

00:09:57.152 --> 00:10:00.836
without any worry about anything, without any fear of anyone;

00:10:00.973 --> 00:10:04.600
but just [that] they are your brothers and you are their brothers

00:10:04.714 --> 00:10:06.781
and that you have to love them.

00:10:08.288 --> 00:10:12.370
That’s only possible when we’ll get out of our fears here.

00:10:13.303 --> 00:10:16.565
Because there is also another side to it that ego always

00:10:16.644 --> 00:10:20.007
has a fear; because it aggresses others it is afraid also

00:10:20.689 --> 00:10:23.022
because it knows others can aggress.

00:10:25.566 --> 00:10:28.227
So this is a point we have got to think about.

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:31.536
But that never means that in any way despise yourself,

00:10:31.638 --> 00:10:34.586
never! You are saints, you must know that.

00:10:35.175 --> 00:10:36.703
You are realised souls!

00:10:36.804 --> 00:10:39.171
How many there are realised souls in this world?

00:10:39.285 --> 00:10:41.528
How many there are who can raise the Kundalini?

00:10:41.627 --> 00:10:45.019
How many there are who understand what is vibrations?

00:10:46.389 --> 00:10:48.461
I’m going to tell you, on Guru puja,

00:10:48.564 --> 00:10:50.412
what things you have achieved,

00:10:50.492 --> 00:10:52.825
and how many things you have got within you,

00:10:52.938 --> 00:10:54.752
built-in now, which are working,

00:10:54.855 --> 00:10:57.915
and how your chakras are awakened through Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:57.995 --> 00:11:00.058
As he says, “Yes, it has happened.

00:11:00.192 --> 00:11:02.865
” But what are we doing about it?

00:11:03.489 --> 00:11:06.811
It’s is the greatest of the greatest that can happen to anyone;

00:11:06.902 --> 00:11:08.022
that you know.

00:11:08.659 --> 00:11:13.429
Also you know this is the greatest happening

00:11:14.268 --> 00:11:21.023
which was prophesised long time back as the Last Judgement.

00:11:23.676 --> 00:11:27.596
You know that this is the way you are going to be judged,

00:11:27.756 --> 00:11:31.293
so we have to work very hard, we have to work.

00:11:31.678 --> 00:11:34.170
It is effortlessly given to you, alright,

00:11:34.294 --> 00:11:37.957
but to maintain it, to keep it up to go higher,

00:11:38.059 --> 00:11:40.675
we have to religiously work it out

00:11:40.982 --> 00:11:46.492
with a very humble attitude –receiving more and more and more,

00:11:46.764 --> 00:11:49.235
imbibing it into your being.

00:11:49.717 --> 00:11:53.768
Let it trickle into your being, completely covering it.

00:11:53.961 --> 00:11:59.310
Let that joy, that Eternal Bliss come into you.

00:11:59.569 --> 00:12:01.951
I am so anxious for that.

00:12:03.466 --> 00:12:06.286
Do not make yourself a small person.

00:12:06.817 --> 00:12:08.483
Have a bigger vision,

00:12:09.356 --> 00:12:12.338
have bigger ideas because now you belong

00:12:13.019 --> 00:12:17.098
to the Bigger Thing, the biggest of all, the Primordial,

00:12:17.563 --> 00:12:20.647
the Highest, to the Viraat!

00:12:21.758 --> 00:12:25.406
If you realise your importance then you will work it out.

00:12:25.944 --> 00:12:29.252
You see, if you see an Indian Sahaja Yogi, you will be amazed!

00:12:29.365 --> 00:12:31.904
He sleeps only for two, three hours or four hours,

00:12:32.076 --> 00:12:34.456
but he will not give up his sadhana.

00:12:34.592 --> 00:12:36.781
If he can get his full sleep it’s alright.

00:12:36.937 --> 00:12:39.451
First thing he sees is, “One hour for sadhana in the morning.

00:12:39.554 --> 00:12:41.487
I have to get it out somehow.

00:12:42.389 --> 00:12:46.149
” But sleep? We have been sleeping all our lives!

00:12:48.757 --> 00:12:52.178
We have to correct ourselves, we have to rise,

00:12:52.723 --> 00:12:54.410
we have to go ahead

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:56.350
– to achieve your own.

00:12:56.462 --> 00:12:59.790
That’s the main point is! See your own selfishness,

00:13:00.498 --> 00:13:03.115
I am telling! To know yourself is the greatest selfishness.

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:07.144
If you do not know yourself, all the selfishness is useless.

00:13:08.081 --> 00:13:11.276
As you call a swartha (स्वार्थ), in Sanskrit it is said ‘swartha’,

00:13:11.387 --> 00:13:12.874
Swartha means ‘selfishness’.

00:13:12.977 --> 00:13:15.106
If you break it ‘swa’ ‘artha’

00:13:15.228 --> 00:13:17.940
– if you know the meaning of your ‘swa’, means your ‘self’,

00:13:18.088 --> 00:13:20.488
then it is the greatest selfishness.

00:13:24.273 --> 00:13:27.774
So this is what it is and we are very happy that he’s here.

00:13:27.876 --> 00:13:30.484
We’ll be going to India also, next year

00:13:30.575 --> 00:13:32.205
we also are planning to go to India

00:13:32.307 --> 00:13:34.926
and you are going to meet [them]. Lots of them may come

00:13:35.017 --> 00:13:36.579
to Delhi and Bombay.

00:13:36.704 --> 00:13:38.113
They are all waiting for you,

00:13:38.204 --> 00:13:39.914
they are all planning how to receive you,

00:13:40.016 --> 00:13:43.474
they are so happy that so many of Sahaja Yogis

00:13:43.566 --> 00:13:45.741
from London and all over will be coming.

00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:47.574
And you know how they look after you

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:49.590
and how they are happy and how they are joyous.

00:13:49.704 --> 00:13:51.789
And certain things definitely have

00:13:52.251 --> 00:13:54.598
gone wrong with us, we know that.

00:13:54.801 --> 00:13:57.388
We should understand them because these are the

00:13:57.501 --> 00:14:01.365
troubles of our over-thinking and over-reading

00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:04.154
and over-domination

00:14:04.472 --> 00:14:07.147
but we can get rid of it very easily.

00:14:07.296 --> 00:14:09.255
It is just to detach yourself

00:14:09.357 --> 00:14:12.302
and see for yourself addressing yourself, “Now Mr.

00:14:12.405 --> 00:14:14.590
how are you?” If you say like that,

00:14:14.693 --> 00:14:17.538
immediately your attention will go,

00:14:17.811 --> 00:14:21.212
through yourself you will see your outer being.

00:14:21.429 --> 00:14:23.218
That is very important.

00:14:23.332 --> 00:14:26.255
The more you see yourself clearly, the better it is.

00:14:26.335 --> 00:14:28.023
You have to face yourself.

00:14:28.103 --> 00:14:29.710
And you do not want to face,

00:14:29.802 --> 00:14:31.661
you are afraid of facing yourself,

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:33.826
because you have been aggressing others

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:35.822
and you are afraid to aggress,

00:14:36.514 --> 00:14:38.996
in a way that is towards yourself.

00:14:39.177 --> 00:14:40.773
But there won’t be any aggression

00:14:40.865 --> 00:14:42.667
because that’s the perfect state

00:14:42.769 --> 00:14:45.309
where you see yourself and neither you aggress anyone

00:14:45.445 --> 00:14:49.152
nor you are aggressed by anyone, you just see yourself clearly.

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:50.767
And that is what you have to see.

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:54.089
Gradually you start seeing your chakras, seeing your
problems,

00:14:54.191 --> 00:14:56.651
your thing and you know that how, gradually, it develops.

00:14:56.759 --> 00:15:00.804
But everybody wants a quick results. It’s alright,

00:15:00.974 --> 00:15:04.169
if you want quick results, alright, are you like that?

00:15:04.259 --> 00:15:06.345
If you are like that you will get a quick results;

00:15:06.414 --> 00:15:08.862
if you are not, then be patient with yourself,

00:15:08.988 --> 00:15:11.128
not with me, but with yourself, I am saying,

00:15:11.242 --> 00:15:14.155
you have to be patient, because there is a problem with
you

00:15:14.235 --> 00:15:16.377
so you have to be patient with yourself

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.258
and not with anybody else – that’s is the main point.

00:15:19.382 --> 00:15:21.567
If you are patient with yourself,

00:15:21.976 --> 00:15:25.238
this is a long promised thing which you are going to get.

00:15:25.352 --> 00:15:27.790
But you must learn to be patient with yourself

00:15:27.892 --> 00:15:29.762
and not to be angry with yourself,

00:15:29.862 --> 00:15:33.776
not to debase yourself or not to aggress yourself on to others.

00:15:34.153 --> 00:15:37.532
It’s a very simple thing, it’s the simplest thing to do,

00:15:37.737 --> 00:15:42.133
but because of our complex life and our complicated thinking

00:15:42.338 --> 00:15:45.897
we have become quite twined up into things.

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:49.795
It can easily be got out of, you can just slip out of it

00:15:49.898 --> 00:15:51.578
without any difficulty.

00:15:52.074 --> 00:15:54.078
I know that you can do it

00:15:54.387 --> 00:15:56.987
so forget about all these things like,

00:15:57.140 --> 00:16:00.074
“My father, my sister, my brother.”

00:16:00.332 --> 00:16:02.347
All these problems will be

00:16:02.779 --> 00:16:07.619
burnt in no time as soon as your life runs straight.

00:16:08.529 --> 00:16:11.894
Everything will burn away, nothing will be left

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:16.917
but your light and others who will come to you for enlightenment.

00:16:18.013 --> 00:16:22.443
I know that you are going to have a big day for a Guru puja.

00:16:22.666 --> 00:16:26.581
Before that I would request you to prepare yourself.

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:30.267
I may do something great

00:16:30.416 --> 00:16:33.454
but I must have a proper recipient

00:16:34.044 --> 00:16:36.470
so [for] that you must prepare yourself.

00:16:36.642 --> 00:16:40.823
Think about it – are you loving others? Are you in love?

00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:44.477
Are you in love with everyone?

00:16:45.335 --> 00:16:49.413
Just to think that you love everyone is so great! I mean you ask me

00:16:49.583 --> 00:16:51.564
Everybody says, “Mother, you look so young!

00:16:51.657 --> 00:16:55.182
How do you look?” It’s because I always think of

00:16:55.307 --> 00:16:56.812
how much I have to love.

00:16:56.925 --> 00:16:59.545
You see, so much love I have to give to others.

00:16:59.625 --> 00:17:02.583
Just think how great it is to love others.

00:17:02.809 --> 00:17:05.766
You know how people treat me sometimes, doesn’t matter,

00:17:05.846 --> 00:17:08.379
I’ll still love. I enjoy playing with it.

00:17:09.009 --> 00:17:10.775
In the same way you should love,

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:15.276
and love is the thing that is going to unfold

00:17:15.674 --> 00:17:19.653
beautifully like a lotus opens out it’s petals

00:17:19.754 --> 00:17:22.053
and the beautiful fragrance starts flowing.

00:17:22.169 --> 00:17:24.774
In the same way, your heart will open out

00:17:24.888 --> 00:17:27.436
and the fragrance of love will spread

00:17:27.528 --> 00:17:30.225
throughout the world, it will ring into people.

00:17:30.328 --> 00:17:33.615
I know it can happen, the sooner the better

00:17:33.808 --> 00:17:37.649
and the choice is your own which you have to make a choice.

00:17:37.854 --> 00:17:42.893
So I’m very happy because such a beautiful song to hear

00:17:45.558 --> 00:17:47.574
and just before Christmas

00:17:47.733 --> 00:17:51.032
which is a very big thing for me, you know that.

00:17:51.258 --> 00:17:54.793
And in the same way we are having another Christmas now,

00:17:54.997 --> 00:17:59.135
Christmas to celebrate a new Christ, born within us.

00:18:00.439 --> 00:18:03.157
Let us prepare for His coming

00:18:03.679 --> 00:18:08.996
and how you prepare is not by running away from yourself,

00:18:10.423 --> 00:18:14.125
not by getting into frivolous things

00:18:14.761 --> 00:18:18.071
but by working it out, beautifully.

00:18:18.189 --> 00:18:21.327
Cleansing, cleansing has to be done

00:18:21.577 --> 00:18:27.041
if the Self has to be established in the temple of this being.

00:18:28.692 --> 00:18:30.862
May God bless you all.

00:18:34.861 --> 00:18:38.477
Now first before meditating, in your heart,

00:18:39.531 --> 00:18:44.679
or, you should see in your heart,

00:18:46.196 --> 00:18:57.157
and there try to put your Guru in the core of it.

00:19:00.462 --> 00:19:03.303
After establishing in the heart,

00:19:08.295 --> 00:19:10.134
you must bow to that

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:18.363
with full devotion and dedication.

00:19:19.632 --> 00:19:22.441
Now, whatever you do with your mind,

00:19:22.544 --> 00:19:27.351
after Realization, is not imagination

00:19:28.054 --> 00:19:30.104
because now your mind,

00:19:31.079 --> 00:19:34.514
your imagination, is itself enlightened.

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:43.259
So project yourself in such a way that you humble down

00:19:45.368 --> 00:19:49.175
at the feet of your Guru

00:19:55.128 --> 00:19:58.705
and now ask for

00:20:03.388 --> 00:20:10.528
the necessary temperament needed for meditation,

00:20:10.891 --> 00:20:16.401
or atmosphere needed for meditation.

00:20:17.335 --> 00:20:23.761
Meditation is when you are one with the Divine.

00:20:27.676 --> 00:20:30.338
Now if there are thoughts coming in,

00:20:33.139 --> 00:20:36.246
first you have to say the first mantra, of course,

00:20:36.471 --> 00:20:38.463
and then watch inside.

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:47.037
Also you must say mantra of Ganesha, will help some people.

00:20:47.997 --> 00:20:51.112
And then you should watch inside

00:20:55.950 --> 00:21:01.766
and see for yourself which is the biggest hurdle.

00:21:04.234 --> 00:21:06.063
First the thought.

00:21:09.567 --> 00:21:15.742
Now, for the thought, you have to say the mantra of Nirvichara,

00:21:15.862 --> 00:21:22.809
that, “Twameva sakshat Nirvichar sakshat

00:21:22.929 --> 00:21:26.046
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi namoh namaha”

00:21:26.546 --> 00:21:28.046
Should say it thrice.

00:22:05.734 --> 00:22:08.029
Now we come to the hurdle of your ego

00:22:08.149 --> 00:22:11.115
because, you see, the thought has stopped now, no doubt,

00:22:11.235 --> 00:22:13.637
but there’s still a pressure on the head.

00:22:14.023 --> 00:22:18.071
So, if it is ego, you have to say,

00:22:18.191 --> 00:22:23.186
“Twameva sakshat Mahatahamkaara…” – Mahat means ‘the great’,

00:22:23.306 --> 00:22:26.641
ahamkara means ‘the ego’  – “…sakshat

00:22:26.761 --> 00:22:31.021
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi namoh namaha.”

00:22:32.357 --> 00:22:34.362
Say it thrice.

00:23:15.659 --> 00:23:20.393
Now, even now, if you find that ego is still there,

00:23:20.805 --> 00:23:25.149
then you have to raise your left side

00:23:25.269 --> 00:23:27.799
to push it back to the right hand side,

00:23:27.919 --> 00:23:31.898
with your hand; one hand towards the photograph.

00:23:36.237 --> 00:23:39.650
Push the left side higher and right side lower

00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:43.345
so the ego and super-ego get the balance.

00:23:51.847 --> 00:23:53.778
Do it seven times.

00:23:55.611 --> 00:23:59.553
Try to feel it, how you are feeling inside, you see.

00:24:12.166 --> 00:24:19.822
Now you raise your Kundalini up on the head and tie it up.

00:24:22.668 --> 00:24:29.641
Again raise your Kundalini up on the head and tie it up.

00:24:31.489 --> 00:24:36.756
Again raise your Kundalini and tie it up.

00:24:44.875 --> 00:24:48.262
Now at the Sahastrara

00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:52.310
you should say the mantra of Sahastrara, thrice.

00:25:47.779 --> 00:25:50.136
Now it’s opened out if you see.

00:25:50.779 --> 00:25:54.134
Now you can open again your Sahastrara like this.

00:25:54.258 --> 00:25:57.851
Just take it down again and see that you are stationed there.

00:25:57.971 --> 00:26:01.276
Once this has been done then you go into meditation.

00:26:01.396 --> 00:26:06.695
This is like cleansing, you see, called as nyasa.

00:26:23.732 --> 00:26:27.310
Now, if you find any other obstruction, you can also say,

00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:30.856
like, if you have got, say, Mahakali’s problem,

00:26:30.976 --> 00:26:34.692
you can say that mantra, clear it

00:26:34.812 --> 00:26:38.029
and then you sit down for meditation.

00:26:47.119 --> 00:26:50.097
Any individual thing, you can take it out,

00:26:50.221 --> 00:26:52.436
like, if you have the ego problem, if you think,

00:26:52.556 --> 00:26:54.857
then you should start with Mahatahamkara.

00:26:54.977 --> 00:26:58.400
It is what you have to find out: What is your problem?

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:03.581
Where is the Kundalini stopping? You can feel it within yourself.

00:27:29.417 --> 00:27:31.475
Some of you may not feel.

00:27:31.595 --> 00:27:35.207
If you do not feel it, feel it on your fingers.

00:27:35.327 --> 00:27:37.235
If you are not feeling within yourself

00:27:37.355 --> 00:27:40.795
then feel it on your fingers, you can feel it.

00:27:43.891 --> 00:27:46.327
Ah, Better.

00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:03.849
How is it now? Better? Where is the problem? Hmm?

00:28:10.383 --> 00:28:11.650
Yogi: Central heart

00:28:12.832 --> 00:28:15.046
Shri Mataji: Central heart?

00:28:15.388 --> 00:28:17.723
Alright, hold your breath.

00:28:19.507 --> 00:28:23.173
Not with great force, just ordinarily. Alright?

00:28:23.293 --> 00:28:25.662
Sakshat Jagadamba 10x

00:28:38.835 --> 00:28:40.787
Alright? Leave it.

00:28:49.079 --> 00:28:55.137
Better now? Once again? Alright, hold your breath.

00:28:56.059 --> 00:28:57.592
Sakshat Jagadamba… Haa.

00:29:05.434 --> 00:29:06.567
Leave it.

00:29:13.033 --> 00:29:18.687
Better. Keep your eyes open. Again. Hold it.

00:29:19.018 --> 00:29:21.227
Sakshat Jagadamba…

00:29:30.963 --> 00:29:36.185
Leave it. Better now?

00:29:41.453 --> 00:29:43.923
Much relief. Alright?

00:29:45.503 --> 00:29:51.826
I mean, now left side. Put your left hand towards Me,

00:29:51.946 --> 00:29:57.063
right hand up there. Left hand towards Me, right hand like that…

00:30:23.338 --> 00:30:26.857
Hmm. Like this. Douglas, like this.

00:30:32.184 --> 00:30:34.946
Better? It’s liver.

00:30:39.323 --> 00:30:44.622
Over-thinking gives you liver also. Better.
