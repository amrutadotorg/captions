WEBVTT

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:09.620
Today, we are going to celebrate

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.540
the puja of Virata and Viratangana.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.820
North America and South America,

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:38.860
as you know is the Shri Krishna’s center of Vishuddhi.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.300
And it is very important to know also

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.260
that all the communications,

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.540
all the relationships with the whole creation

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.980
has to be established through this center of Vishuddhi.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.820
Vishuddhi, as you know is the most important center

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.740
in your ascent, in a way.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:18.860
Because Sahaja Yoga is not only meant for your ascent

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.380
but for the ascent of the whole world,

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.660
and only through Vishuddhi you can achieve it.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.060
Even if you get your self-realization

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:40.620
and you get all the powers,

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.900
unless and until you use your Vishuddhi, it won’t work out.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.540
Look at my Vishuddhi also,

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.820
talking, talking everywhere, keeping communications,

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.220
Vishuddhi goes out!

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:04.660
Also, this Vishuddhi chakra being so important,

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.660
it is under attack.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.740
Attack of the negative force.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.340
Today we are going to worship Virata and Viratangana.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.780
Virat is the ultimate,

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.780
the complete development of the Vishuddhi chakra is Virata.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.500
And as you know the chakra is here

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.700
here at this point.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.220
If this chakra is not alright, you are not collective.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.660
You behave in a manner that is not collective.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:59.780
You cannot communicate with other Sahaja yogis.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:08.340
You cannot be friendly, loving and one with other Sahaja yogis

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.940
unless and until this center here,
Vishuddhi is alright.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.220
And it is part of Ekadesha.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.100
Vishuddhi is the center of the Ekadesha Rudra.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:38.580
So one has to understand that Virata Shakti is spread all over.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.140
We have communications.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.100
Mean I could telephone from here to anyone

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.660
and they told me they don’t charge much.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.340
You see is something also from Shri Krishna’s blessing, I think.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.740
Because you telephone from anywhere else it is very difficult,

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.380
and very expensive.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:06.100
Also, most of the communications vehicles

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:13.700
like computer, like television, other things also,

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.780
all those so many of them were developed in this country.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.540
So it is the subtle of that Ether

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:32.260
which communicates us to other worlds.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.340
That is one power of Virata.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.900
That he is the subtle of that.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.180
The second power which we have

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.500
of Viratangana we can say because Virat is

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:01.540
the kinetic force of but the source is Viratangana,

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:12.580
is everything that brain can do.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:28.780
All thinking, all creativity, all compassion,

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:41.020
all kinds of looking after other nations.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.220
The other day somebody asked,

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.020
“Why should we be policemen of the whole world?”

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.700
You jolly well have to be,

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.260
because, you are Viratas.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:58.620
So you have to look after the law and order of the whole world.

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.820
You have to look after

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:05.860
all the people who are suffering in this world.

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:09.900
You have to look after all the suppressions

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:15.660
and the wars and the civil wars everywhere,

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.460
is all your headache,

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:24.140
because you are sitting in the land of Virat.

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:29.340
So He’s the Father.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:35.660
He’s what you call Jehovah.

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.060
He’s Akhbar.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:46.260
So on the brain level

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:53.860
when Kundalini reaches and enlightens your brain

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:58.460
then this science that you know

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:08.820
becomes logical not only that but you know meta science

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:15.500
because the brain which was just knowing science

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:18.740
now knows the source of science.

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:24.380
The whole thing it can see, clearly.

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:31.140
Like you climb up a hill or a mountain,

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:39.340
the higher you go you can see the whole vision of the place.

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:46.260
In the same way whatever is created out of your brain, anything,

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:52.500
you start getting the whole vision of it what they have created.

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:57.780
Not only that but you also see what has created that.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:00.660
Now they created United Nations.

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.740
It had to be here, Why?

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:05.340
Why in America?

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:13.180
Why is America so much worried about United nations?

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:19.380
What is its responsibility?

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:21.340
No country will do that.

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:23.300
It’s a headache.

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:25.620
But they’ll go to Vietnam,

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:27.540
they’ll go to Korea.

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:29.391
Now they are busy with Bosnia.

00:08:29.512 --> 00:08:32.752
Everywhere, Somalia.

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:37.020
It’s your responsibility

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:41.820
because all these things are created by your brain.

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:46.020
The human brain has created different nations.

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:52.260
So above all we realize that all these nations

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.540
belong to one world.

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:59.940
Once you rise above you see that this was created by us,

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:05.420
by our own thinking, by our own projections we have created.

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:17.540
So when you go above this you start thinking of one world,

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:21.220
because you see that it was one world.

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:23.220
It is one world.

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:30.340
You start seeing God has created beautiful rivers

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:37.500
and beautiful mountains, He never divided.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:41.260
I mean He wanted to create beauty for you.

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:43.060
But then we started thinking

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:47.340
“This is my land, that is my land.”

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:51.420
Most of the Americans have come from outside,

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:54.220
and the real land owners I don’t know where are they hiding.

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:56.140
I seldom see them.

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:01.860
Now the responsibility is coming in their heads

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:05.420
that we have taken this land

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:13.580
and we feel that this is our land

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:17.100
but it belongs to the whole world.

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:21.020
Whatever they have done now is coming back.

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:24.020
Once you rise higher you start seeing the vision.

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:28.940
Whatever you have done through your mental projections.

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:32.700
People don’t even realize in many countries

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.540
that this is one world.

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:44.380
Mental projection is on another level

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:50.820
is that you have created a materialistic world.

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:54.940
With this materialistic world

00:10:55.060 --> 00:11:00.620
you have reduced everything to the level of money.

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:05.340
Religion is money, everything is money.

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:11.660
Nobody has any respect for anything but for money.

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:19.140
And then material things.

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:27.100
One starts seeing matter as a source of wealth

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:31.140
and source of dignity

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:39.980
and a source of great positions, powers.

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:49.820
But when you rise higher into Virata’s power

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:54.260
you see the stupidity of materialism.

00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:59.340
What is matter after all?

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:07.060
Matter is for making the place beautiful,

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:10.860
giving you joy,

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:20.980
and this matter is also for expression of your joy to others.

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:23.620
When you give them some present,

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:27.420
some material thing beautifully made.

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:30.140
Then you start thinking also

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:35.980
how God has created this beautiful world

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:44.540
and you start creating beautiful things

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:54.700
in art, in music, drama, even films, everything.

00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:03.420
But at the material level and at the mental level

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:07.300
the projection is linear; it moves like this.

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:10.300
As a result, it falls down.

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:16.860
So everything, the standard of our expression has fallen down.

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:22.140
I know films in the twenties and thirties and forties

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.060
from the same Hollywood

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:27.180
were very different from what they are today.

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:30.420
You can’t even see some of them.

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:35.540
Then in the same mental projection

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:40.900
we see the dramas and the novels and the art,

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:45.940
everything has come down, is deteriorated,

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:53.060
is not at all joy giving but it is destructive.

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:56.780
It is destroying itself, first of all,

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:59.300
and so it is destructive.

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:03.340
As a result, we are moving our mind

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:06.500
and moving on that decline also

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:11.380
and we also take to things which are destructive.

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:15.820
Our standards in everything have gone down.

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:19.500
Morality also is an innate blessing to human beings

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:26.380
but he starts putting it on a mental level.

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:31.220
When you put it on the mental level

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:35.180
people like Freud become Christ,

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:37.540
and you start following them

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:42.300
and you become nothing but a sex point.

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:49.780
In every direction if you see there’s a big decline

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:55.740
and you get upset, you don’t understand,

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:59.340
how there is such a decline in human nature,

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:03.660
how there is a decline in art, decline under treasure,

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:06.060
decline on human relationships,

00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:10.180
in everywhere you find this decline.

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:13.940
With money of course, certain things

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:18.500
may appear to be smart, fast, like tennis you can say.

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:23.460
People used to play tennis for joy, never for money.

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:26.260
But now they play for money and

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:30.180
after four, five days we find he has gone down,

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:33.860
or four, five years he is finished.

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:43.500
So the speed has come also into sports because of money.

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:47.380
This money has been like a big load

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:57.500
has brought down all the beautiful things in its own level.

00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:02.180
They are not the same level at which they are created.

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:04.380
If it was on the same level,

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:08.700
Sahaja Yoga would have worked very nicely in America.

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:14.820
But it did not, because here is the maximum load

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:22.380
on all our creations of our mind of our mental projections.

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.740
Whatever direction you will see

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:29.340
you will find there is such a decline.

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:34.780
We know of lawyers who would be so honest

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:39.660
and who would work out something

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:42.540
for the person for whom they are fighting.

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:45.540
But today you can bribe the lawyers.

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:54.300
We know the doctors which would go all out to cure patients,

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:59.300
they have lost their sense of ethics.

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:03.020
Everybody has lost the sense of ethics.

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:12.220
First is this materialism, money and above all I think

00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:18.900
at this time there is a big growth of people

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:22.700
because this is a resurrection time.

00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:26.140
And many types of people are born.

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.660
Thousands and thousands of them are born

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:33.100
who might be like animals or maybe

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:39.740
some sort of absolutely idiotic type

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:43.540
or maybe some stupid stuff.

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:47.700
At this time, we have to do resurrection work,

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:50.820
means what, that our Virata Shakti

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:55.860
has to be enlightened in our brain.

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:14.300
So in Sahaja Yoga when you rise into Virata Shakti

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:21.140
you go up and see all these declines,

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:28.060
all these falling mental projections, from that height.

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:31.340
And also you see yourself.

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:37.660
That you had gone into all these nonsensical things,

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:40.940
but now you feel that you have come out of it

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:45.020
and now you have become like a lotus.

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:47.940
Especially the ego part.

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:54.660
Ego is extremely strong in modern times. It was never so.

00:18:56.540 --> 00:19:05.780
It is, I think the birth of many fighting cocks

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:11.060
has come on this earth and also

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:16.540
some of the jungle creatures are also reborn.

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:18.540
Because you can’t talk to them.

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:21.100
If you say anything they just jump on you.

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:22.860
You cannot criticize them,

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:24.980
you cannot tell them what’s wrong with you,

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:26.500
they’ll just sit on your head,

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:28.940
if you say anything they’ll start hitting you.

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:32.860
They never want to see what’s wrong with them.

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:38.380
It’s impossible to communicate to them because of their ego

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:44.740
and this ego has come because of certain

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:48.700
declining nature of the modern time.

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:54.420
For example, from childhood

00:19:54.540 --> 00:20:01.140
a mother starts scolding her child for spoiling her carpet.

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:04.740
So carpet becomes more important.

00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:07.500
So the next day the child gets very angry,

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:11.540
he gets the scissors and cuts the carpet

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:13.580
to punish the mother.

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:23.020
Then they see that the child wants money for something

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:25.860
and they ask him for what.

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:28.900
“Because I have seen in the television that

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:33.020
there is a bear which has a birth date.”

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:38.020
So a new type of devils have come up they are entrepreneurs

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:40.860
and through their mental projections

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:44.020
they take out novel ideas,

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:47.780
see like a teddy bear which has a birth date,

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:51.380
can you imagine, such a stupid idea.

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:54.900
And all the children wanting to buy that.

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:59.380
Now if one child buys another must have it.

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:02.460
All kinds of things these entrepreneurs do.

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:06.420
And people start becoming slaves of them.

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:11.420
Like in Paris they started a fashion

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:15.660
that you’ll have six inches of skirts.

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:18.020
So all other skirts were thrown away.

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:20.420
The six inches skirts started.

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:23.980
Imagine in that cold, they would wear socks

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:28.180
and six inches of skirts. Everybody looks the same.

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:30.780
What is so beautiful about it.

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:35.180
Whatever they want the entrepreneurs so called,

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:42.100
they are called as artists, also as designers,

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:47.660
but their designs are just to kill your freedom,

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:51.180
just to make you a slave.

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:56.900
And all kinds of monkey tricks they play, which you accept.

00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:00.780
Once you start accepting those monkey tricks,

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:08.780
then you don’t also realize that how you have become a slave

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:13.140
and there is no individuality about it.

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:19.300
Hairstyle they will start particular hair style.

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:23.140
So everybody goes about with the same hairstyle.

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:26.260
Or you go to a hairdresser.

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:42.380
So when you rise into your Virata Shakti

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:46.180
by the enlightenment of the Kundalini,

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:53.660
the Viratangana is the power which gives you

00:23:54.060 --> 00:24:01.060
a complete vision of the decline

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:07.420
into which every mental projection

00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:15.260
which was idealistic, beautiful has fallen.

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:24.420
For example, Abraham Lincoln gave a very great idealistic idea

00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:30.620
about the a state, about democracy.

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:35.620
But now many people say that it is demonocracy.

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:40.420
Those people who were in Russia, of course they were wrong,

00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:43.500
but still they had an argument

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:46.940
that we don’t want to become democratic

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:52.860
because look at America.

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:58.340
Nothing is safe, nothing is normal,

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:03.060
so what’s the use of becoming democratic country.

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:09.420
Can you hear me there, it's all right! it's all right.

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:18.340
After all we are on a picnic, you see.

00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:26.300
And we cannot have any problems

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:31.060
because I told him whatever is here is here,

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:34.100
and whatever is not, is not here.

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:38.300
So if you have any problem, we can’t help it.

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:50.980
So you rise to that level, gradually, gradually,

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:54.620
first, I don’t know what you see.

00:25:56.220 --> 00:26:02.100
But you start seeing what’s wrong with your society,

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:09.300
what’s wrong with your relationships.

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:14.500
Ultimately, you start seeing what’s wrong with you,

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:17.940
how you are wrong.

00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:22.740
That I would say is the higher state

00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:25.340
where you reach and you start seeing

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:28.060
"This is wrong with me".

00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:38.580
After that you start understanding

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:46.500
that you have got powers, Viratangana’s powers.

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:51.460
You have got powers.

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:56.100
In your brain itself, you have got powers.

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:11.100
By which you understand the Meta Science,

00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:17.340
science above science, the meta art.

00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:23.540
The vulgarity of art. Discrimination starts working,

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:28.900
you start understanding what is really art, what is not.

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:33.980
You start enjoying that art.

00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:40.180
And the enjoyment of Nirananda,

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:47.100
you get it when you rise above and see

00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:51.060
the whole thing in a different perspective.

00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:59.220
First of all, you see it as a drama, as a witness.

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:04.060
And you laugh, you see.

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:09.740
I was telling a joke about a lady who was interviewed

00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:14.540
for doing some art with the mehndi on the hand.

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:17.540
She’s an Indian lady from India.

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:20.300
So the interviewer asked her,

00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:25.740
“What about the foreigners, how do they react,

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:28.260
the Americans, how do they react?

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:33.100
She said that they ask very funny questions.

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:37.060
Funny questions? Yes, they ask me, “What is this?”

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:41.940
So I said, “This is my Suhaag,

00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:49.260
my husband’s symbol, that's what I wear.”

00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:54.460
So they said, what about extras?

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:58.900
“You didn’t follow?”- What about the extra husbands if you have?

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:06.140
Now you all are laughing at it, you all Americas are laughing,

00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:08.620
but at that time point you would not have laughed,

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:10.820
because very common.

00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:17.980
In the same way, everyone,

00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:23.260
even India or any place where they do absurd things

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:30.700
it becomes very obvious and you start seeing it very clearly,

00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:37.780
very very clearly that what are we doing, it’s all absurd.

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:43.140
But this is not only on mental level.

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:45.140
This is what I am going to tell you.

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:48.460
It is not just you see the vision,

00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:51.260
all right, still mental level,

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:56.180
then you understand it is wrong, still mental level.

00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:59.420
But you just don’t do it.

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:06.500
You become part and parcel of Virata.

00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:14.180
When you become part and parcel of Virata then

00:30:16.892 --> 00:30:21.452
you don’t have to even think, you just see it, and you laugh.

00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:24.820
You just see and you know it is wrong.

00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:28.180
It is all absurdity.

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:38.380
We went to see one temple in India

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:43.980
and there were some pujaris, doing puja.

00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:47.540
So the Indian Sahaja Yogis ran out.

00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:49.300
I said, “What happened?”

00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:53.380
“Mother, they are all hypocrites, they have horrible vibrations,

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.380
how can they do puja,

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:58.420
they have horrible vibrations, all bhoots.

00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:08.580
That’s how we become so powerful,

00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:13.300
I would not say you are like a light,

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:17.220
because light doesn’t see the light does it?

00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:24.700
But you see, you are light and you see light.

00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:34.300
And the third thing that happens to you with this Viratangana

00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:41.180
that you humble down. You humble down.

00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:48.460
You become extremely sweet, obedient,

00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:51.100
just like children.

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:56.580
And you don’t mind anything, anything you don’t mind.

00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:06.820
That is the state you achieve not as a slave,

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:15.420
not out of domination, but it just works in you,

00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:24.260
it penetrates into your brain, you become that.

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:28.820
I’ve seen people who are horrid absolutely,

00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:32.860
and after some time you can’t even recognize them.

00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:36.820
How do they change?

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:41.140
How do they get the change?

00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:44.300
What happens to them?

00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:50.460
Is the brain is enlightened, has become the light

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:53.460
and you know you have the light.

00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:56.820
That is doubtless awareness.

00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:59.820
You should have no doubts about yourself,

00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:02.860
that you are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:05.820
Some people falsely have.

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:08.660
They are bhoots but they say no we are Sahaja Yogis.

00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:10.300
That’s not the thing.

00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:18.540
The discretion power becomes so beautiful

00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:22.140
of the Hamsa Chakra, because they are all connected,

00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:25.660
the Vishuddhi, Hamsa and Virata.

00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:30.380
They are all connected centers.

00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:34.260
It is not only that the Virata improves,

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:38.580
but the Vishuddhi improves and Hamsa.

00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:45.340
So now what happens that you jump into collectivity.

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:50.500
Collectivity is the blessing of Viratangana.

00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:59.540
She teaches you how to love each other.

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:05.620
She teaches you how to enjoy other Sahaja Yogis.

00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:14.340
She teaches you how to have bhakti in your heart.

00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:23.180
But that teaching is like innate.

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:27.460
If I say She teaches, means you are the disciple

00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:29.620
and She is the teacher, No, No.

00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:33.980
You become Viratangana yourself.

00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:39.860
And the love and the affection and the understanding

00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:44.540
that you have for each other is remarkable,

00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:48.660
is very enjoyable and very beautiful.

00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:51.860
So all that happens,

00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:56.060
absolutely happens in your brain.

00:34:56.180 --> 00:35:01.300
That’s how your brain, which is

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:06.660
the one which receives all the information

00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:10.500
and creates all the information,

00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:14.340
creates all the mental projections

00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:20.260
becomes a new vehicle to create a dimension

00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:23.900
which goes higher, not declining.

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:30.020
All of you are part and parcel of that, all of you

00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:35.260
are part and parcel of that and all of you are important.

00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:37.980
All of you have to support that,

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:40.420
all of you have to raise it.

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:42.060
It is very important;

00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:49.940
you all should understand your own responsibility.

00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:55.580
So between South and North America

00:35:55.700 --> 00:36:02.100
we have to at least have 16,000 Sahaja Yogis.

00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:12.060
Krishna was very clever,

00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:16.380
He created his 16,000 powers into ladies.

00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:21.780
Then these 16,000 women were taken away

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:27.140
by one king and he just kept them.

00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:32.660
So Shri Krishna went and defeated that king

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:39.260
and brought all the 16,000 powers to himself, very nice.

00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:42.580
He could do all those tricks, not Me.

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:48.380
I have to have 16,000 children who are human beings

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:52.420
and who get this power within them.

00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:58.060
Not like my own powers I manifest. What is the use?

00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:00.420
You can’t give realization to others,

00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:04.420
you cannot communicate towards others, you cannot do anything with them.

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:08.860
So Shri Krishna only told Gita, finished.

00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:14.100
They were clever people, they didn’t want to face the problem.

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:17.300
It’s very difficult.

00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:21.020
You people have a bad Vishuddhi, I get it.

00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:23.980
You people have a problem, I get it.

00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:26.740
It's just collectively to work out.

00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:31.180
To take you inside my body as a cell

00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:36.500
and to cleanse it, it’s very very difficult task

00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:38.980
but one has to do it.

00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:43.740
One has to do it and one will do it.

00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:48.580
I’m sure one day when you all will be

00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:54.420
completely aware of Viratangana power within yourself,

00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:58.540
I don’t know what will happen to this country.

00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:03.540
As it is I find it is just bubbling now, about to break.

00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:07.620
It’s a big breakthrough I find this year,

00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:15.460
among Sahaja Yogis as well as among the other people.

00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:19.260
But there was another quality of Shri Krishna

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:24.340
was diplomacy, is to be diplomatic.

00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:27.140
With others you have to be diplomatic.

00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:31.380
You should not just jump on them and try to oppress them,

00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:33.500
or in any way try to show

00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:35.460
that they are nowhere compared to you, No.

00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:38.340
You should say that we were like you, worse than you.

00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:42.660
Then people are happy. But see now we have changed.

00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:46.860
Somebody says that “I was smuggling drugs

00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:51.420
you should say no I was smuggling even arms”.

00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:58.380
Then their ego will not be hurt,

00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:01.020
if their ego is not hurt then it’s easy.

00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:04.060
So diplomacy also you must learn.

00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:08.220
Also Diplomacy is a mental projection at a lower level.

00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:17.100
At a higher level diplomacy is where is your charisma,

00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:21.620
where you attract people, where you capture them.

00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:25.820
How you talk to them, how you behave towards them.

00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:29.100
And also have a compassion, because

00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:31.220
you are now sitting on the Himalayas,

00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:33.460
but what about these poor people.

00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:37.300
In that way if you see the whole thing I am sure

00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:41.700
you will not feel so much

00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:46.260
that you are doing this work and that work.

00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:53.860
Shri Krishna’s whole philosophy is like this.

00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:56.660
That you should get your “Ghyana”.

00:39:56.780 --> 00:40:00.420
Ghyana is Ghy means Gnostics,

00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:03.300
you have to become Gnostics means

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:05.340
on your central nervous system

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:08.020
you must know it. That’s the first thing.

00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:12.940
The second thing was because Arjuna was so half-hearted,

00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:16.460
still he asked him questions.

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:27.620
So he said,

00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:37.620
“What about Karma? Everybody talks of Karma.”

00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:40.380
Again diplomacy.

00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:43.780
The whole Gita is full of diplomacy

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:47.220
and normal human beings can’t understand.

00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:53.580
So he said, “Yes of course, you must do your Karmas,

00:40:53.700 --> 00:41:00.020
but you have to surrender your karmas at My Lotus Feet.

00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:02.620
No not possible.

00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:08.540
Very clever because as long as you have

00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:12.540
“I am doing this, I am doing that” idea,

00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:17.300
how can you put your karmas onto the feet of Shri Krishna.

00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:20.980
That means you should get your realization

00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:24.300
where you know you that you are not doing anything.

00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:27.420
When that happens that you know you are not doing anything,

00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:33.420
at that time the Karma becomes Akarma.

00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:37.980
And how you talk, I’ve seen people raising Kundalini

00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:40.660
saying, “Mother, it doesn’t rise, it doesn’t work.

00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:43.580
You don’t say that, “I am doing it.”

00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:46.940
You just say, “It doesn’t rise, it doesn’t work out.”

00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:51.660
in the third person. Another is about Bhakti,

00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:58.140
because now we have lots of these Hare Ram’s, Hare Krishna’s

00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:00.340
spoiling their Vishuddhi.

00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:06.300
So for Bhakti He has used only one word.

00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:12.420
He says, “You give me flowers, you give me water,

00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:15.660
you give me leaves, I’ll take them.”

00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:18.380
But while giving what does He say?

00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:21.860
“But you must do “Ananya Bhakti”.

00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:25.420
“Ananya” means when there is not the other,

00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:29.420
when you become one with Me, when you are connected.

00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:32.500
On “Ananya” word he has danced

00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:35.340
the whole thing and these stupid people don’t know

00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:38.900
that they are not connected as yet and they are talking

00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:43.700
about Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Hare Rama.

00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:45.980
That’s how they are not connected.

00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:48.940
They don’t understand that they have to be connected.

00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:53.660
And this is the trick he has played with all the people

00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:55.300
that “All right, all right

00:42:55.420 --> 00:43:00.300
you go on saying Hare Rama, Hare Rama we’ll see.”

00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:06.860
So the diplomacy part in his case because

00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:12.380
He had to bring them to the point that

00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:15.900
No, No, this doesn’t work out, No this doesn’t work out.

00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:19.700
So then “Gyana. Now what is Gyana is they start reading books,

00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:25.620
No, No. It means 'bodh', means on your central nervous system

00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:30.500
you have to do. So how gradually he brought them to that level.

00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:33.580
In the same way when you are dealing with others

00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:36.380
you have to work it out that way.

00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:39.620
And once you work it out that way,

00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:42.700
you can spread Sahaja Yoga much faster.

00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:44.980
You’ll be a very light person,

00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:47.180
everybody will enjoy you

00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:50.620
and you’ll have no temper, nothing.

00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:56.620
We get into temper because

00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:59.500
we don’t know how to handle the situation.

00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:01.740
If we know how to handle the situation

00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:04.020
we’ll never get angry, on the contrary

00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:08.540
use the anger of another person for your own benefit.

00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:14.580
All these things you learn through the power of Viratangana.

00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:21.460
Viratangana gives you the full detachment

00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:26.500
from every subject of worry.

00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:33.300
She sucks in all this and throws them in the air.

00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:45.100
It is Her great power that has really given you

00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:49.900
such an understanding about life, about yourself.

00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:53.740
Your own value system has changed.

00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:59.620
If you see what a change it was for you,

00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:07.140
all this transformation, everything is the power of Viratangana.

00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:12.740
And ultimately what She gives you is “Nirananda”.

00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:22.260
Is the joy, joy and nothing else but joy.

00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:26.300
May God bless you.

00:45:50.493 --> 00:45:51.739
(Shri Mataji compliments Gregoire.)

00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:57.300
I must give full credit here to Gregoire

00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:04.140
because he came and struggled and fought and like Arjuna you see,

00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:10.860
he felt very desperate and went away.

00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:14.380
He had to go also in any way.

00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:18.540
And suddenly as he is gone,

00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:23.660
I find here is everything so sprouting, so well

00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:28.140
and people have started taking over the responsibility

00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:31.300
of working out Sahaja Yoga.

00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:35.340
But I still remember him at this time

00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:38.940
because he was really very desperate

00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:46.260
and absolutely fed up with the American style of thinking.

00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:49.580
But now we’ll give him a very good news

00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:55.300
that how America has improved.

00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:09.300
We have many Sahaja Yogis in America

00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:11.340
who have been very dedicated

00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:15.100
despite all kinds of negative forces and everything.

00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:18.220
With all the nightmares they have gone through,

00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:20.980
they are stuck on to Sahaja Yoga

00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:28.340
and I find that their efforts are now showing results.

00:47:31.460 --> 00:47:33.060
I will not take their names

00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:36.260
because you know all of them very well one by one.

00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:42.460
But I must say that Steven has done a great contribution.

00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:46.100
I never asked him to come to America.

00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:52.060
But he himself decided and he himself came here on his own

00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:58.620
and he has really contributed a lot to Sahaja Yoga by coming here.

00:47:58.740 --> 00:48:00.060
May God Bless You.

00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:15.380
Of course, your leader is there

00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:19.100
and all the leaders in every place

00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:22.580
have been really working very hard

00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:29.900
and I just see how things are prospered in one-year time.

00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:32.420
It's very creditable.

00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:35.860
We never had so many people for the Puja.

00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:41.180
I am quite surprised as all of you being here.

00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:42.700
Thank you very much.
