00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:26.460
You can't imagine how a Mother who has so many beautiful children

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.220
sees them in such joyous mood

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:38.780
with their families, their children, nicely settled down.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:45.420
It's very satisfying to see you all so much

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:53.220
in joy and complete oneness with the Divine.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.700
One has to realize only one thing:

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.220
that though you are many,

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.980
still compared to the population of this world, we are very few

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:13.220
who really know the true knowledge, the real knowledge.

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.300
You are the people who are knowledgeable, no doubt,

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:26.140
but also knowledge which is not being adorned with truth

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.740
or which is not the true knowledge has no meaning.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:36.900
All that vanishes into thin air because it is artificial.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.460
By your Kundalini awakening you all have achieved

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.380
that state where we can say you know.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.620
You know what is the real knowledge is,

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.900
but think of the people who do not know what knowledge is.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:01.540
We take, for example we say that

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.700
our knowledge is nothing but love,

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.380
but one should understand the discrimination.

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.220
The knowledge that is love within you

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:17.060
is just emitting out from your being.

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.060
You don't have to assert, you don't have to think,

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.700
you don't have to read some sort of a poetry

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.260
or go into some romantic mood

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:36.140
just pure love which emits, and this is the knowledge also.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.820
How you have to relate it is this way:

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:47.420
the knowledge that you have about yourself is evident,

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.780
is absolutely expressed on your fingertips,

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.380
and about others also.

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.220
You know about others and about yourself.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:06.420
This is the greatest subtle knowledge you have.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.300
No one knows like that.

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:14.380
Apart from you people, no one knows about themselves or about others.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.540
So this knowledge that has come to you,

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:22.980
which is extremely subtle,

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:28.140
extremely secretive, absolutely secret.

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.900
If you know about somebody, you know.

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:35.900
Others do not know that you know about them,

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:41.300
and so this knowledge that you have got is nothing but love.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:47.060
It's very difficult to make knowledge and love put together,

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:50.620
because our idea of knowledge is very different,

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.140
what we read from the books.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.220
How can you love from the books?

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.980
What love means, our attachments

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:02.900
to us, in ignorance we get attached

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:09.420
to people, to children, to family, to things.

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:16.460
By getting attachment it is proved that we do not have the knowledge.

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.900
If you have the knowledge then all attachments

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:24.300
should just drop out and you should become a global personality,

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.100
a drop in the ocean.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.340
For example, we are attached to many things,

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:32.300
like we are attached to our family.

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:36.380
Something happens in the family we get very disturbed,

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:37.780
we can't bear it.

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.260
If anything happens to our children, we feel horrible,

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.220
it's just the whole world is falling on you.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:50.300
Then from family you move on. You are attached to your friends,

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:54.780
to your neighbors; you are also attached to your country.

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:59.820
Attachment to your country is also not knowledge.

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:02.780
Once you are a realized soul,

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:06.620
you just start seeing your country clearly:

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:13.060
what wrong it has got, what ignorance it has got,

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:15.540
in what darkness it exists,

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:21.820
and in what way it is quarrelling, fighting for rights and things.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:25.540
But with the knowledge that you have within yourself,

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:30.380
you see it so clearly what is the problem of your country

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:37.140
then you try to improve that through your love,

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:41.580
means the power of your knowledge is love.

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:44.220
If you have all the knowledge within you,

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:49.700
and if you are just sitting at home and meditating, it has no meaning.

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:53.900
What you have to go is to go about, tell people

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:58.140
you have to meet other people, your friends, your family

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:03.700
and other relations about your knowledge.

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:09.580
If you cannot do that, then your knowledge is not with love.

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:12.380
It's such a connection between the two.

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:16.060
You feel like telling everybody that you've got your realization.

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:20.220
You feel like telling everyone that you are a realized soul,

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:23.460
but in that you feel that you are expressing your ego.

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:26.980
All right, by some other ways, some other methods,

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:31.940
you can express to them that you have the true knowledge.

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:36.900
When you have the false knowledge you can get ego.

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:40.820
You can think that "I know so much, I know about this,

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:47.740
I know the color of the carpets, all the shades, everything."

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:52.300
Any stupid thing if you know, you think that you are very great.

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:55.300
That's the sign of stupidity in your head also,

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:58.820
that you think this is very great to know.

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:00.900
Now we have discovered

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:07.340
that through all kinds of acquiring knowledge in the whole world,

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.700
what we have achieved? Nothing.

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:14.700
There are wars going on.

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:18.540
There's all kinds of destructions coming in.

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:24.420
I saw on the television this George.

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:28.700
It's a whirlwind which is going round and is killing so many people;

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:33.140
is destroying so many people without understanding what he is doing,

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:36.100
but he's there and he's acting very well.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.420
So is it that he doesn't understand,

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:42.340
or is it that he understands

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:46.860
and that he is doing something just to correct people?

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:49.540
This also we should have full idea.

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:54.540
Like yesterday when I came here it was raining heavily,

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:58.220
and then I sat down and suddenly it stopped,

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:00.980
stopped till the whole program was over.

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:05.620
Till I spoke it was not working,

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:10.300
but suddenly when you started clapping, also it started clapping

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:18.540
that's what it was. So even the nature knows who you are,

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:22.220
but you must know the nature, this is the point.

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:28.820
Nature will act according to what your level of spirituality is.

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.340
Surprisingly I always felt

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:34.380
that there cannot be levels of spirituality.

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:38.460
I felt that once you get realization you are there,

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:42.460
but later on discovered I was wrong; it is not so.

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:45.500
Even after getting realization, I found

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:51.460
people had so many obstructions in rising.

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:56.700
There were so many temptations which were keeping them down.

00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:03.380
So one had to work out on different chakras, different nadis,

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:06.380
somehow or other to make you perfect,

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:10.260
because the perfection within only will give you

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:14.300
the authority to use this knowledge.

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:18.180
There are as I told you two ways of doing it.

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:22.260
The other day I told you that you should not react.

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:24.780
It's human nature to react.

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.500
It's absolutely human,

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:30.460
but if you have to become superhuman, you should not react.

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:34.300
By not reacting you will grow, definitely you'll grow,

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:37.300
but if you react then you cannot grow,

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:42.340
because you are working under the pressure of other thing

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.420
that is not yourself.

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:47.260
Now supposing as I said I see these carpets,

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:49.540
I know the color and this and that,

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:51.980
and I react to it - finished.

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:56.780
I will not have any sense of judgment if I react to it,

00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:58.780
but if I don't react,

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:03.220
then I'll know whether these carpets have got vibrations or not.

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:05.740
Are they emitting vibrations or not?

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:11.540
Now what are these vibrations? That is the love.

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:14.540
So the communication is like this: if you have the light

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:16.900
you can see things.

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:19.540
So when you see things the light is there,

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:22.380
and light gives you the perception,

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:25.140
gives you the vision to see things.

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:28.300
In the same way when you are enlightened,

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:32.340
what happens that these vibrations start flowing,

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:33.900
just like the light,

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:39.220
and in that light you can see things which are good and which are bad.

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:47.220
But sometimes you put the same parameters as human beings do.

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:52.460
Like you go to some house, a very nice house, very good house.

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:55.460
All these things make you very happy;

00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:58.860
but actually, what about that house?

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:06.380
Is it having good vibrations or it's having bad vibrations?

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:09.620
Is it worth living there or not?

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:12.140
Like the other day they told Me they can

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:15.100
get a very nice place in Milan,

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.900
little beyond Milan, on rent, very cheap.

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:21.540
I said, "Why is it so cheap?"

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:24.380
Immediately I felt the vibrations of the place.

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:28.060
I said, "Did you go and see the vibrations of that place?"

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:31.220
They went and saw - this was all burning.

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:35.540
Then they found out that there was a Scientology there for years together.

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:39.140
I said, "That's not the place where you can live.

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:42.940
You have to have a very pure place.

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:47.180
Even hut of a poor man would be better

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:50.060
than this comfortable so-called place."

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:54.340
So one has to use the vibrations all the time

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.580
to understand everything that you are doing.

00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:00.100
In that also it can be misleading them.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.860
Some people feel vibrations

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:06.060
and they tell Me, "Mother, I felt the vibrations

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:08.860
and I felt I should marry this man."

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:11.700
I said, "You did fel the vibrations?"  "Yes"

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:15.540
"Yes I did, very much, and I must marry this man."

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:18.620
And when I see the man I see the bhoot in him.

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:23.580
I said, "My God, what sort of vibrations this lady

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:24.900
has felt about him?"

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:29.420
So in your judgment what is there: there's no pure knowledge.

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:33.980
So see how, how connected they are

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:36.980
vibrations which is love;

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:43.380
and also the other thing which you have to have is the knowledge,

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:46.140
the pure knowledge, the true knowledge.

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:52.180
We can say that pure knowledge and true knowledge is like the energy

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:54.300
like electricity.

00:15:54.460 --> 00:16:01.780
And the way you feel it, the way you understand it,

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:06.300
it exists. That is love.

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:10.380
People don't understand also what is the love is.

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:14.300
They get mad after someone and say that,

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:18.300
"Mother, I say I think that I am in love with that person."

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:20.700
And after five days they'll come and say,

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:24.540
"Mother, no, I won't have anything to do with that person."

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:29.700
Why? Because you have not got the pure knowledge.

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:34.180
You did not feel the pure knowledge

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:37.140
in that person through your vibrations.

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.420
Now see how connected it is.

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:42.260
Like we can say the sun and the sunlight,

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:44.820
what is the difference between the two?

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:48.540
Sun is there. When sun comes, there's sunlight.

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:50.500
So what is the difference?

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:55.220
Or we can say the moon and the moonlight; what is the difference?

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:59.220
There is no difference in these two things

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:02.620
one is the moon and another is the light.

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:09.620
So all these things are very, very confusing,

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:13.700
that we don't understand how confused we are about it,

00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:19.820
and we don't understand how our vibrations can mislead us.

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:25.220
Because vibrations are there, all right,

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:28.700
but sometimes even if they are missing,

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:31.620
just to justify yourself you will say,

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:37.540
"We have vibrations and we feel that it's very good, excellent,"

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:41.220
and later on you'll discover that it's not so.

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:44.900
So even now when we are realized souls,

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:50.700
we should know what is encompassing us, which is around us;

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:56.060
what is that which makes us feel that

00:17:56.220 --> 00:18:00.300
it's all right, it is good, we should have it.

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:06.820
Once we start understanding that vibrations of pure knowledge

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:09.980
are of a very different nature,

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:12.940
then you're not attached to that person,

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:15.220
you're not attached to that family,

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:18.460
you're not attached to that country - nothing.

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:24.060
But what you feel is the pure vibrations coming to you.

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:27.060
This is the point which is very confusing

00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:31.420
when you say, "My vibrations are good. I like those vibrations"

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:37.220
and while you jump into the ocean of filth.

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:39.300
Many people have asked Me, "Mother,

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:42.620
why is it sometimes we make mistakes?"

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:48.060
You do not make mistakes. It's your ignorance, which is darkness,

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:52.740
and that's why whenever you plunge into it you fall into trouble.

00:18:52.900 --> 00:19:01.220
So to understand that our knowledge has to be completely clear.

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:05.740
Like in our house supposing we have a lamp that's dirty,

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:07.980
you cannot get the light.

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:11.780
In the same way if our heart is not clean

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:15.220
specially our heart, if it is not clean,

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:20.220
then we start doing things believing that it's right,

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:24.460
and by which we hurt yourself or others.

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:28.540
It's a very, very common error in human nature

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:33.380
to identify wrong things as right

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:41.700
and just to make themselves look such a great, such a divine thing.

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:44.780
As I told you now there are people who want to

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:47.300
say, divide the country;

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:50.380
simple reason they want to divide.

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:54.020
Now they want to divide this thing

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:56.460
because they want to have importance.

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:59.140
The few people who want their importance

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:03.380
will instigate others, tell them, "All right, we must have freedom.

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:06.940
If we have freedom we'll have this country for ourselves

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:08.900
then we can develop ourselves."

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:12.820
Or a part of the country which is richer, which is better off,

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:15.460
they will think that "It's all right, we'll have

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:18.700
all the money to ourselves, we'll have everything to ourselves,"

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:23.780
so they divide. They can divide in the name of religion,

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:27.220
in the name of prosperity - whatever it is.

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:32.740
But if you divide the country actually you are facing a big problem,

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:39.140
because you have seen that wherever people divide they fall into

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:47.700
a kind of a dark, dark dungeon from where they cannot come out.

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:49.820
It's just a few people

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:56.660
whose ego is that they want to have some land as their own,

00:20:56.820 --> 00:21:01.420
but they die; not only die, some of them are murdered,

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:04.700
and like that idea

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:08.980
that idea that "We'll have this possession of the land" goes away.

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:13.620
So in the same way we can see on smaller things also.

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:17.060
In smaller things also we are very much identified,

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:20.980
that "If I have this thing then everything will be fine."

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:25.300
You cannot understand how people just jump at things and say,

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:27.900
"Oh Mother, this is ours,

00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:34.900
this is ours, we must do this for ourselves," openly.

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:38.340
They don't think it's wrong to say that

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:41.780
"This is my country; I must do for my country."

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:46.300
And another says that "This is my country; I must do for my country."

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:48.980
As long as there is this "my and I"

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:52.220
that means there is no knowledge.

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:54.860
The knowledge as I told you, pure knowledge

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:58.740
is that which gives you a pure light.

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.140
Pure light means pure vibrations.

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:04.140
Now vibrations can be misleading as I told you,

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:08.500
or could be the quantity of vibrations can be less or more.

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:13.060
But there's another way to see - is to see for yourself,

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:16.620
why do you want to do a particular thing?

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:22.300
Mental also you can use, parameter of mental understanding.

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:26.900
"Why do I want to do it? What is the gain for all the people?"

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:30.220
If you start thinking from that angle

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:33.220
that "What is the gain for others, what will they gain by this,

00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:35.620
why should I do it?" - you'll be amazed.

00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:39.540
You will get the real picture of what you are doing.

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:44.260
So you must keep yourself all the time

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:46.940
in a state where you witness yourself.

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:52.540
You see yourself, that "Why am I doing this? What is the purpose?"

00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:55.220
Sometimes it could be some conditioning,

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:59.220
could be some sort of a psychological thing, could be anything.

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:03.820
But if you start watching carefully "Why I'm doing it?"

00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:07.940
you'd be amazed that your vibrations itself

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:10.900
will start telling you on your fingertips.

00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:14.620
But sometimes the vibrations are so superficially coming,

00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:18.980
"Ah, I got the vibrations, I'm this, I'm that."

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:21.820
For this reason I am saying again and again,

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:24.420
though you are such a nice family of Mine

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:26.620
and we are all so much blessed

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:30.580
and we have so much of knowledge with us,

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:34.740
we should be very wise.

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:39.140
If there is no wisdom, if there is no wisdom,

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:42.980
we can never understand what we are doing.

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:46.220
Now to develop this wisdom, what have you to do?

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:49.820
See every time, if I say anything they'll come otherwise,

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:54.740
"Mother, how do we get wisdom? What is the way to get the wisdom?"

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:57.380
Wisdom you have already within you,

00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:01.220
Shri Ganesha is already there, who gives you the wisdom.

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:04.620
But you must take to Shri Ganesh.

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:08.620
There I find people become so much addicted to Shri Ganesh

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:13.820
that they lose His identity completely,

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:20.900
they become very slavish about the whole thing

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:23.620
and they just believe that,

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:28.820
oh, they are very spiritual, they are very great.

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:33.100
All these false ideas are no good.

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:37.580
Does your Ganesha gives you wisdom?

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:43.780
Now you must count, how many wise things have you done so far?

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:48.540
Where did you take a very wise decision?

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:51.540
Have you been wise to do something,

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:55.140
or you have been just doing it because you are identified

00:24:55.300 --> 00:25:00.900
with a particular type of life or particular type of answer?

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:06.460
So wisdom is a thing that gives you, first of all, complete peace.

00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:11.220
If your wisdom is developed then you become very peaceful.

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:14.580
Because whatever people may say, whatever they may do,

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:18.380
whatever aggression they may do, whatever it is, you are peaceful.

00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:23.220
And you see the stupidity of the other person, of the other nations,

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:26.540
and you understand why they are doing it.

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:30.540
This wisdom is such an important thing in human being,

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:35.380
because animals don't have so much wisdom as we have.

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:39.500
Sometimes of course, sometimes we have even less than animals have.

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:43.620
But still, by experience, you see,

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:47.140
we have to learn that we have been making mistakes.

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:49.900
So many mistakes we have committed so far.

00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:55.300
Now are we going to commit more mistakes or are we going to be wise?

00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:59.020
Wisdom is not apparent outside.

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:04.460
You can't say somebody is wise by looking at that person,

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:09.100
but in vibrations you will know that that person is extremely wise.

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:11.300
He may speak; he may not speak.

00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:16.740
If he speaks he'll speak about something so deep,

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:21.220
so wise, and so nice, without hurting you.

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:23.900
This kind of a temperament

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:28.380
if you develop is to become wise for every question.

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:32.300
For example, some are very attached to their children;

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:37.140
so much attached that they forget that they are part and parcel

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:39.460
of this divine Force,

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:42.300
and they just start doing all kinds of things.

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:46.700
The other day I met one lady whose son was very sick,

00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:48.940
and she took him to the hospital

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:51.540
and doctors gave him all kinds of medicines,

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:53.820
and he became even worse.

00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:57.140
Then she telephones to Me, "Mother, I don't know what happened,

00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:01.700
I went to the doctor and doctor gave him this and that treatment,

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:03.980
and the child has become sick."

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:06.540
But why didn't you ask Me before?

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:09.300
Why did you go to the hospital first?

00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:13.900
Lack of wisdom. I'm there, why don't you ask?

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:16.540
We had one case here in Cabella.

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:22.140
There was one child who fell down and broke his arm.

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:25.380
Now the mother didn't show any wisdom.

00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:27.540
She took the child to the hospital

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:29.980
and the doctor said, "Tomorrow we are going to operate her

00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:33.020
and put some artificial arm inside."

00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:37.540
But the father was sensible. He said, "All right, tomorrow, no?

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:39.660
Today I'll take the child at home."

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:42.700
He brought the child to Me in the night about three o'clock.

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:45.980
I said, "All right." I put it right.

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:49.380
Next day when he took it to the hospital the doctor said,

00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:53.540
"But now there's no need to operate because his arm is all right."

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:54.980
See the difference?

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:58.820
One is worried, immediately they'll go to the doctor,

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:02.780
instead of consulting Me, asking Me. They are Sahaja yogis,

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:06.900
but they will go and ask the doctor to do something or other.

00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:10.660
Once the doctors start doing something then they'll come to Me.

00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:15.740
There's lots of miracles must have taken place

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:18.140
about Sahaja Yoga, I must say,

00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:22.300
and in that you should see the wisdom helps you.

00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:25.900
Of course My attention is there always, no doubt,

00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:32.380
but still you should not take it for granted; you have to ask.

00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:36.060
One day, you see, I was just sitting; I just thought

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:41.380
that I should telephone somebody in the ashram of New York.

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:43.500
I never telephone there.

00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:51.140
So I found out the phone number, we telephoned and asked if ...

00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:59.340
I said, "Is the child all right?" So the leader there was surprised,

00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:02.100
because that boy had fallen in the water

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:05.380
and was in the water for quite some time,

00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:08.780
and he was all filled with water, even his brain was

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:12.860
filled with water. As usual there were some doctors who said

00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:15.700
that he cannot survive and even if he survives,

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:20.220
his brain has so much water that he cannot be normal.

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:26.700
So I just said that "Don't worry." I didn't know. Nobody told Me.

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:31.060
"Don't worry. The boy will be all right completely."

00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:35.020
So they were surprised how I said so.

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:37.460
Firstly how I knew

00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:39.980
that the boy had fallen, there was some boy like that.

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:44.660
And then they didn't know how I said he'll be all right,

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:49.140
and he was all right. He's perfectly all right.

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:54.700
So they were surprised at My knowing about it

00:29:54.860 --> 00:30:01.620
how is it that Mother knows that there's a boy who is so sick?

00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:06.700
Here I will say it is pure knowledge.

00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:10.820
You see, My attention is always around you people

00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:13.620
always dealing with you people.

00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:19.620
And how I know is this: that this attention of Mine is global

00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:24.060
so anything happens to you, any upsetting takes place, any,

00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:29.700
I should say, deviation takes place

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:32.140
My attention is there.

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:35.700
And immediately I know there's something wrong somewhere,

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:39.860
and I don't know how My attention goes to particular places,

00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:43.380
which makes it

00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:49.380
life better, it helps people in need.

00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:52.420
I don't do anything about this attention

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:55.460
but this attention is the wisdom,

00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:57.900
the wisdom that spreads all over.

00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:02.820
With that wisdom you know what's wrong with another person

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:07.740
or any other organization that is in Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:10.020
Everything you come to know.

00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:14.260
If you want to know it's different, it just you know.

00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:16.540
Like you spread out everywhere.

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:18.220
For example, if you have to telephone,

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:20.140
then you have to use the telephone,

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:23.980
but for Me I don't have to use the telephone, I just know.

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:28.820
So this has come from a pure innocent wisdom.

00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:33.020
The innocent wisdom is just like a child

00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:36.220
It is everywhere, and it communicates

00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:41.180
and it tells what's the matter, what's the problem is.

00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:45.140
Many people have been cured with Sahaja Yoga, many have been cured.

00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:48.340
Now if they can say that "Mother, how did we get cured,

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:51.420
what have You done? Did You see our chakras?

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:54.260
Did You find out what was wrong with us?"

00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:58.380
No, I haven't. I haven't, but I leave it,

00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:03.180
in My wisdom I leave it to Paramchaitanya to do the job.

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:06.060
This is the main point is, that can you leave

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:10.700
that can you leave everything to Paramchaitanya in your wisdom?

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:13.860
If you cannot, then yet you have not felt

00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:18.220
the real knowledge within you.

00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:20.580
That is the level of some people are.

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:24.420
I am not now so sure about those who get realization

00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:27.420
are all so much filled with pure knowledge.

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:30.460
Some of them are, but not all of them.

00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:36.740
With experience they learn. With meeting people, they learn.

00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:42.140
But as the wisdom, pure wisdom, is difficult for them

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:49.460
because they do not rely entirely on the Paramchaitanya.

00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:55.620
Everything happens, just Paramchaitanya knows,

00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:58.860
it understands, it organizes, it loves,

00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:03.580
it does everything. That's the Energy it is. It does everything.

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:08.940
And how it manages, how we call coincidences are really organized

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:10.820
by Paramchaitanya.

00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:15.540
As I told you yesterday the way the rain was,

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:22.460
the rain came and went away. It has wisdom.

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:27.620
Innately it knows I am sitting here, the program is going to start

00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:29.300
stops!

00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:31.220
Flowers know Me.

00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:33.980
You don't know, when we have flowers,

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:36.820
they are of this size, I don't do anything to them;

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:40.340
they start growing, growing like this, they blast like that.

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:43.060
Now one would say, "Mother, how do they know?"

00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:47.980
Because they are natural. We are unnatural.

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:52.820
We have taken so many artificialities as part and parcel of life.

00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:57.700
See all kinds of courtesies, this, that - all that's not necessary.

00:33:57.860 --> 00:34:01.700
All these stupid practices

00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:04.820
that we have adopted sometimes keep us away

00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:09.660
from pure knowledge. And when there's no pure knowledge,

00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:11.620
we don't know anything what's happening.

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:15.180
We just get frightened for small things, upset for something.

00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:17.980
I mean it's something very surprising to see

00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:21.140
Sahaja yogis getting upset.

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:25.180
Among the hundred people if supposing there's a problem,

00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:33.700
so if you are a Sahaja yogi you have to just witness, and see.

00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:38.700
If you cannot do that then you are not a Sahaja yogi.

00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:45.140
But it's not like practicing, you know, like they say

00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:50.700
if you have to have the blessings of Shiva,

00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:54.060
you must say a hundred-and-eight times His name.

00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:57.060
That's not the way - He doesn't like it.

00:34:57.220 --> 00:35:02.140
You see, nobody likes that kind of a murmuring.

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:05.500
You see somebody comes and takes your name all the time

00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:07.900
near your door, you will throw him out.

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:10.500
So that's not the way, this is a wrong idea

00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:13.460
that you go on taking the name of somebody

00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:18.660
and that deity will help you.

00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:23.740
First of all you have to become wise enough to understand

00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:29.700
that you are a part and parcel of Paramchaitanya.

00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:32.900
Everything will work out by that,

00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:36.140
and it works out so beautifully.

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:40.020
Of course some people have hard time, I don't say they don't have.

00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:44.580
But it is not hard, because if you are one with Paramchaitanya

00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:48.060
and you know that it is doing the job, you are not feeling

00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:53.460
that hardness or sickness or anything.

00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:57.500
All the people who'll write to Me about their problems,

00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:59.380
I don't know what to say.

00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:03.140
Could just say that "Do you believe in Paramchaitanya?"

00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:08.380
All right. It knows. It knows what is to be done.

00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:12.980
It knows what is to be corrected. It knows what is to be said.

00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:17.500
See, it can create poetry, it can create music, it can create everything;

00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:21.660
but do you leave everything to the Paramchaitanya?

00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:24.220
This is the second point in wisdom:

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:29.700
do you have wisdom to leave everything to Paramchaitanya?

00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:32.460
After experiencing also.

00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:35.300
Like there was one lady who was going in the car

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:41.380
and she found her car and the brakes weren't braking,

00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:45.300
and she didn't know what to do. Now if the brakes are no more,

00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:47.740
how will she manage? It was in Germany,

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:50.460
and all the cars were moving very fast

00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:54.020
and she didn't know what to do. So she put her head

00:36:54.180 --> 00:37:01.900
on the steering wheel and she said, "I leave it to Paramchaitanya."

00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:05.460
She said, she leaves it to Me - all right, this is the same.

00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:09.700
So by saying that, what happened? She said, "Mother I don't know,

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:13.580
when I raised my head I found my car was taken

00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:22.820
on one side of the road and nobody was there.

00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:25.060
All the cars were passing by,

00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:28.300
but somehow or other this car was taken there

00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:31.060
very nicely by some Force."

00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:36.540
So the wisdom lies in understanding the working of Paramchaitanya:

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:40.980
how it guides you, how it helps you, how it preserves you;

00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:43.900
how, depending on Paramchaitanya,

00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:50.580
you can continue to be living very happily.

00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:55.700
I think in Sahaja Yoga we have lost very few Sahaja yogis.

00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:58.980
They live for long, they don't die,

00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:03.460
and if you ask their experiences, it's very amazing

00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:06.140
how it works out.

00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:10.620
If they don't want to live also they can pass,

00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:13.860
but if they want to live, Paramchaitanya takes over

00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:15.620
and you can live long.

00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:19.380
But living long doesn't mean that you go on bothering yourself

00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:22.140
as to what you will do with your money,

00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:26.220
how will you live, what will be the source.

00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:29.780
All these nonsensical things, worries, come to you, all right.

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:36.140
Then the Paramchaitanya says, "All right, go on worrying."

00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:40.140
If you go on worrying, all right go on worrying, doesn't matter.

00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:42.860
What will happen?

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:45.380
Whatever has to happen will happen.

00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:48.020
But Paramchaitanya can interfere,

00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:50.900
in case you leave it to Paramchaitanya.

00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:55.900
It's said many a times, "Leave it to God, leave it to God,"

00:38:56.060 --> 00:39:00.540
but "God" means ... I don't know what they mean by God.

00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:03.020
God means Paramchaitanya,

00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:09.740
God means living divine Force that is working everything.

00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:12.780
So the another way of looking at it

00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:15.540
is the wisdom that we should understand,

00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:21.740
that each and every particle of this world is created by Divine,

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:23.500
by the divine Force.

00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:28.460
And this particle and everything is completely under

00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:33.460
the guidance and supervision of Paramchaitanya.

00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:38.540
Nothing can move unless until Paramchaitanya works on them.

00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:42.900
It is something so connected; globally it's so much there

00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:45.540
that people don't realize

00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:50.220
what they are doing, what they should have done.

00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:54.740
I mean on many scales you find something happening.

00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:59.740
Like supposing something is happening now in America.

00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:06.020
Just try to find out what America has done to other countries;

00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:08.620
immediately you'll get the answer.

00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:12.580
So also it takes

00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:17.740
full care of the persons who believe in Paramchaitanya,

00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:21.220
who give everything in the hands of Paramchaitanya.

00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:25.740
We give things to the police, we'll give to the doctors,

00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:29.060
we give it to the some civil people,

00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:31.700
civil what you call them, engineers

00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:34.380
to do some things.

00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:43.220
But they can make mistakes; they can create problems.

00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:45.980
But you leave it to Paramchaitanya.

00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:50.820
It's something so remarkable that in My own life

00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:56.220
I have seen that all the time it works for Me.

00:40:56.380 --> 00:41:00.460
I was building a house in Pune

00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:05.620
and we had to put a slab - very, very big slab

00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:09.820
needed about three hundred bags of cement for that.

00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:13.420
So I got the cement and I got the people,

00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:16.500
but they said, "You're to start early in the morning

00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:20.180
and you can finish next morning, twenty-four hours."

00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:25.260
I said, "All right." So at about five o'clock I told,

00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:27.660
"Let's go, the work is over."

00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:30.740
They said, "How do you know?" I said, "I know, let's go and see."

00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:34.780
So imagine, which was going to finish

00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:35.980
after twelve hours was already finished

00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:39.060
and all the workers were walking about.

00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:41.300
And everybody said, "Mother, it's a miracle.

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:45.300
How can such a big slab be laid in such a short time?"

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:47.980
I said, you see, to make them understand I said,

00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:51.060
"Must be Hanumana must have done the job."

00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:52.220
But all these people, all these deities

00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:56.540
are part and parcel of that Paramchaitanya.

00:41:56.700 --> 00:41:59.540
Now you are worshipping the Mother.

00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:02.740
To worship the Mother is the biggest thing because

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:07.260
all these deities and everybody are Her children,

00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:10.420
under Her command, under Her desire.

00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:19.020
So to worship the Mother, the story of as you know about Ganesha,

00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:21.300
that the Mother said that

00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:24.460
"The one who goes round the Mother Earth three times,

00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:27.660
I will give Him a present."

00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:30.220
So Shri Ganesha thought in His wisdom,

00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:33.980
"Who is greater than My Mother? No one else."

00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:36.540
Because He knew He cannot compete with His brother

00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:44.980
who has got a peacock for a conveyance.

00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:52.700
So He said, "How can I go round and win over this person?"

00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:57.020
So best is to take to wisdom.

00:42:57.180 --> 00:43:01.740
"My Mother is greater than everything else."

00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:05.540
So He went around His Mother three times and He got the prize,

00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:09.100
and the other brother was just still moving on.

00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:13.460
When He came back He found that the present is already lost.

00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:19.780
So again and again I'll say it is the wisdom that helps you,

00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:24.100
the wisdom to leave everything to Paramchaitanya.

00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:26.860
And this is something,

00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:30.220
for a modern person, very difficult to understand.

00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:32.660
He can't calculate two plus two.

00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:37.540
He's so bad because of this computers and things like that,

00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:40.260
is absolutely hopeless

00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:48.500
as far as any mathematical calculations are needed or...

00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:50.940
Now I am, I must say,

00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:55.140
I don't know how to handle any computer or any calculator;

00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:59.740
but if you ask Me just like that, "Mother, how much will it be?"

00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:05.900
I'll say so much, and it will be that. It will be that.

00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:11.740
But I am so sure about it, it cannot be anything else but that,

00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:13.700
and it works that way.

00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:20.260
Sometimes of course, if I want to tell some wrong thing

00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:22.380
just to mislead the person

00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:26.700
then I may say something, but normally I know it is that.

00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:30.780
But I know not like the way we know;

00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:34.300
I just know it, that's what it is, just know it.

00:44:34.459 --> 00:44:41.979
So I am not saying that you develop your knowledge to that extent

00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:45.180
that you can do it, but your wisdom.

00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:49.260
If you start using your wisdom, it will always come handy.

00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:54.220
In anything that you do, think of the wisdom.

00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:58.580
My advice to you is

00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:04.900
that as your Mother loves the whole world, loves all of you,

00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:08.980
and cares for those who haven't even got realization,

00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:15.220
you should also strive to create more people for Sahaja Yoga.

00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:19.060
But in that if you start behaving in a manner all the time saying,

00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:23.060
"You are catching this, you are a bhoot, you are this, you are that."

00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:29.060
I never said that to anyone, so you shouldn't say like that.

00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:32.340
That's no love, that's no understanding.

00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:37.100
The understanding is that you were just the same as the person was

00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:39.300
and now you are knowledgeable,

00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:43.300
so you must use your knowledge to correct that person,

00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:46.660
not to put him down.

00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:50.060
And that correction is also not verbal;

00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:54.740
it's just through your vibrations you can correct the other person.

00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:59.300
Most of the Sahaja Yoga work sometimes I've seen that it stops

00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:03.820
because we are very methodical, we become like great teachers,

00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:09.580
we start telling them stories, and then they get fed up with you.

00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:14.380
So when you are handling other people, as I said,

00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:17.140
we have to spread the knowledge, very important,

00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:19.540
we cannot keep it to ourselves.

00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:23.340
But it's not for any ambition, for any leadership,

00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:25.220
for any kind of recognition;

00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:31.820
but just the use of our wisdom, use of our knowledge

00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:35.700
that we want to help others out of love.

00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:39.620
Not for any recognition, not for any position, nothing.

00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:42.900
Just we want to do it because we love them.

00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:48.740
And I am sure this will work out very effectively.

00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:52.900
And the person who will be helped, or the persons who will be helped

00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:56.300
will be just, be bound to you

00:46:56.460 --> 00:46:59.220
because they find the true knowledge.

00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:01.300
But supposing somebody comes to you and says

00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:03.300
"I know the true knowledge."

00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:10.380
You say, "You might be knowing, but I have to know what you know."

00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:14.580
Then you ask that person; then he'll give you a big lecture.

00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:16.660
You should say, "No, that's not the thing."

00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:19.220
Just smile. Say, "That's not the thing."

00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:27.020
The thing is, true knowledge is a part and parcel of your being.

00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:35.780
It's just within you. It is not some sort of a concrete stuff

00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:37.940
that you have read or you have understood,

00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:42.140
but it just has become a light within you,

00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:47.460
and that light is there. It has no ...

00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:51.380
it's no necessity for you to be very well educated,

00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:53.060
or to be very intelligent,

00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:56.420
or to be very highly placed, not necessary.

00:47:56.580 --> 00:48:02.300
It is how your heart is clean.

00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:04.540
In the heart it resides.

00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:07.460
Imagine, all other knowledge resides in the brain,

00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:11.980
while the pure knowledge resides in the heart. Very surprising.

00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:18.300
But we do not know also that actually our heart rules the head.

00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:24.180
There are seven auras around the heart which control the brain

00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:29.740
in such a manner that we act in the hands of the Paramchaitanya.

00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:32.980
Unless and until your heart is clean,

00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:38.380
unless and until in your heart you have a beautiful image

00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:49.100
of a person who is very, very pure,

00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:54.300
you cannot, you cannot do anything mentally.

00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:58.140
And from your heart if you have to do, your heart has to be

00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:02.140
very clean and extremely wise.

00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:07.700
This is the point one has to jump into: that your heart, is it wise?

00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:11.820
For example, to get attached to someone too much,

00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:16.380
identified with some much shows that your heart is not clean.

00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:19.700
It has so many bondages.

00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:23.100
Open your heart, fully.

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:28.620
And that's why they say that the Goddess resides in the Heart,

00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:30.860
in the center Heart.

00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:35.980
She resides in the center Heart because She's so balanced.

00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:39.540
She resides in the center Heart as Shakti,

00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:44.860
and She gives you all that you want.

00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:48.700
Within you She's settled down as many things.

00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:50.820
You know the Shlokas which says

00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:56.620
that She's settled within us like knowledge,

00:49:56.780 --> 00:50:00.060
She's settled within us as memory,

00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:02.700
She is settled within us as sleep,

00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:08.780
also She's settled within us as illusion, bhranti.

00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:11.460
She's the one who puts us into illusions

00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:16.820
because we are not yet fully perfected.

00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:29.980
We have to become paripakwa - means absolutely, absolutely matured.

00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:34.900
Till we are matured this Mother Herself puts you into illusions

00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:38.980
and plays around, so that you learn how to be wise.

00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:42.180
So one should understand that She's playing around with you.

00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:45.260
And you should try to be very careful

00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:49.340
and not to be falling into Her maya,

00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:51.540
because if She puts you in the maya,

00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:55.180
you'll go round and round and you will reach nowhere.

00:50:55.340 --> 00:50:59.900
So this power of bhranti is also very important,

00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:05.020
this delusion you can call it, or else you can call it

00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:07.740
a thing by which She creates a drama,

00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:15.660
in which you become like a stupid man being found out.

00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:19.580
So this stupidity and all that

00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:24.900
can be removed by this bhranti that She creates.

00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:31.060
And this power of bhranti is because of human beings as they are,

00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:35.380
because they will not understand something straightforward;

00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:37.380
so it has to go round and round,

00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:39.140
till they reach a point to understand

00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:42.180
that it was the play of the Mother

00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:46.900
that brought them to this shore of wisdom.

00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:51.420
So for us it is important to see that

00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:55.980
so much has been done by Paramchaitanya for us,

00:51:56.140 --> 00:51:58.580
the Mother has done so much for us.

00:51:58.740 --> 00:52:02.740
Now what are we going to do ourselves

00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:06.380
to get all these powers that She has given us,

00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:10.100
to be completely enlightened and developed?

00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:12.540
What have we done so far?

00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:25.220
Nothing to be done as such but to develop a kind of a deep devotion,

00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:31.860
deep understanding; and that depth is possible, absolutely possible,

00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:37.140
because now you are on your way to that perfection.

00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:40.740
So today in Cabella is the last puja,

00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:44.260
and I want to tell you as a Mother

00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:48.860
that you all should depend on Paramchaitanya.

00:52:49.060 --> 00:52:53.020
That's very important, to depend on Paramchaitanya.

00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:56.460
Also there's a habit of many people

00:52:56.620 --> 00:52:58.740
to put the blame on others, like,

00:52:58.900 --> 00:53:03.260
"I got caught up from this person and got caught up from that person."

00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:11.100
You are caught up by yourself only. All such ideas are of no use.

00:53:11.260 --> 00:53:12.580
Face yourself,

00:53:12.740 --> 00:53:14.300
find out about yourself,

00:53:14.460 --> 00:53:18.180
and you have to perfect yourself. That's so important,

00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:21.260
because at this juncture of the time

00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:24.580
people think that something great is going to happen.

00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:26.300
I don't know.

00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:30.220
Two thousand years according to them would be something great,

00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:33.540
but I don't know, because is all man-made,

00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:37.380
all this two thousand year and three thousand year is man-made.

00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:43.500
But I Myself feel, as predicted by many, that possibly

00:53:43.660 --> 00:53:48.180
because of your understanding and your wisdom

00:53:48.340 --> 00:53:51.980
I'm sure something great may happen in this world,

00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:56.620
and things may be brought to a proper level

00:53:56.780 --> 00:53:59.180
of understanding of spirituality.

00:53:59.340 --> 00:54:02.980
Because this is the Last Judgment, and in this Last Judgment

00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:08.380
you have to play a very vital role, which I am sure you can do it,

00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:13.700
if you decide to achieve something for the future.

00:54:13.700 --> 00:54:16.660
May God bless you.
