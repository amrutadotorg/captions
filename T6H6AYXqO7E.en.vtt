00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:12.500
Is very difficult to speak, even for Me

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:27.980
to see so many Sahaja yogis

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:38.380
sitting here with such shining faces

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.900
from all over the world,

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:51.540
as if My vision has taken its form today.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:07.260
I see in you the saviors of tomorrow

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.420
who are going to save this world

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.660
from all the Kali Yuga calamities

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.260
that are surrounding us.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.980
Is coming from all sides,

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:33.380
while you people have really taken your second birth

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.860
from this pond of Kali Yuga

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.540
and have really become beautiful lotuses of different colors,

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.340
hues, fragrance and beauty.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.540
Instead of you celebrating My birthday,

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.580
is better I celebrate your birthdays.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.380
As I told you the other day that

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:16.220
it is you who are such great seekers, seekers of truth, of love,

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.020
that it could work out,

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.660
otherwise it would have been impossible.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.140
To even transform one person is very difficult,

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.660
but you were so sensitive

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.020
and so deep that this subtle knowledge,

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:44.780
I don't know how it penetrated your being.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.340
It's unbelievable.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.220
I can't believe Myself

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:59.260
what great people have taken birth in this Kali Yuga.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.380
No one can believe that there are so many

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.900
saints are sitting before Me, so many Walis;

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.620
so many Nalis are sitting before Me.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.220
In the history of spirituality it has never happened.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.180
Even in the heavens there are few devatas

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.500
and devas, not so many.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.460
One better than the other

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.940
such beautiful heart,

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.940
such brilliant brains

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:55.780
and such active attention, is really

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:02.500
I thank you all that this seventieth birthday I could see

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.100
so many people, which I never expected.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.940
You know, Sahaja Yoga was started with one person

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.100
and then those who came also,

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.940
out of them, some were power-oriented, money-oriented,

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.340
all kinds of people created problems for us.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.900
One after another, so many problems came

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.220
and also there were many who were

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.780
of a very low-level seekers.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:44.140
But I find today they have all come up beautifully.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:50.060
I cannot distinguish one from another,

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.780
the way it has happened.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.260
And the commitment you have to Sahaja Yoga

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:02.500
is the greatest blessings for this world.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:08.140
I could not do it alone. You know that.

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:13.380
If I could do it, I would not have needed you.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.340
You are the channels

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:22.900
and you have to work it out further and further.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:30.340
It is really remarkable the way

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.660
Delhi people have organized everything.

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.300
First of all, everybody was very much

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.140
keyed onto the seventieth birthday.

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:59.460
I don't know what was the reason, but whatever it is,

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:00.820
and then Delhi people said,

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.820
"This time we are going to celebrate,

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.780
Mother, Your birthday in Delhi."

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:10.900
I said, "Everybody's ... on it, so be careful,

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.940
it's not going to be easy. It's a big headache.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.260
So many will be coming down."

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.860
But they didn't expect so much, I'm sure

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.060
... people are coming. Hundred are coming from there,

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:31.260
hundred from there. I said, "Are you worried?"

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.580
They said, "No we are very happy about it."

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:39.100
I saw their enthusiasm, their organization,

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.780
the way they have done it.

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:43.700
The best part of it,

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:49.060
Delhi, which is a place where all kinds of politicians live,

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.260
have groups and politics and all that,

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:57.540
but in Sahaja Yoga in Delhi there is no politics.

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.380
There is no quarrelling.

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:13.300
There is no pulling each other's legs.

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.140
Is very remarkable thing

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:19.260
it to happen in a place like Delhi,

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.380
where every day what you hear

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:26.700
that even in our parliament they are beating each other.

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.540
Perhaps, in this hell only,

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:34.420
this goodness was to be born and

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.500
to be manifested by Sahaja yogis.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.220
The knowledge of Sahaja Yoga,

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:45.340
as you know, is extremely, extremely subtle

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.980
and it's not easy

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:57.500
to penetrate into the so-called

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:00.980
people who call themselves intellectuals

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:09.100
or who are absolutely bowed down to their conditionings.

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:14.180
So, on one side, we have the masses who are ignorant,

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:18.980
another side the classes who live in the frame

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:22.620
that they have made out of their brains.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:28.620
Both ways, I think, they are extremely gross.

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:35.020
But the way they have absorbed

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:44.220
this subtle nectar of Divinity is something unbelievable.

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:50.980
Nobody can comprehend even

00:08:53.220 --> 00:09:03.620
that there were so many born after My birth,

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:07.100
on this Earth,

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:12.060
or some maybe before also, very few.

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:15.860
Just after My birth they were born here

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:23.220
in this world, to get to Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:28.620
But when I saw the world I was shocked,

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:31.180
more shocked than Kabira, himself.

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:35.980
I said, "How will I talk to anyone about it?"

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:38.140
My family members,

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:42.620
I didn't know how will I open the subject to them.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:50.860
Was impossible, so much was darkness of ignorance.

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:58.460
How will they believe that there is really Divinity,

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:03.580
there is totality waiting for them?

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:07.700
They all believed into some sort of a religion,

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:11.020
which had no connection with reality.

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:17.940
And it was impossible even to envisage

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:22.060
the method by which I could talk to them.

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:25.180
I remember the first incident

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:32.580
when we went to Nargol, where I had opened the Sahasrara.

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:38.900
The first person who got realization was a Gujarati and a jeweler.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:42.700
Immediately, all the other,

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:46.220
there were hardly about thirty-five people

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:47.780
they started saying that

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:50.580
"Of course, he's a rich man, he's a jeweler,

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:53.380
so Mother has given him realization."

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:57.420
I think that's the first time and last time I really got angry.

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:01.340
I started shouting at them,

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:03.340
"You are good for nothing, useless people,

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:06.220
you can never take to Divinity,"

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:08.980
and I had really thought that "Stop it now."

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:11.500
One has to take another life,

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:17.220
another time where people will understand what is Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:22.260
But after that, suddenly,

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.540
people started feeling the cool breeze in their hands,

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:30.420
immediately, after My shouting. Imagine.

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:36.940
And they said, "Mother, You know, it's working.

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:39.820
It's working in us. It's working out of us."

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:44.540
Thus, we got twelve people

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:51.700
and one lady whom I had given before also,

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:55.860
she was the fourteenth.

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:03.740
Thus, first we had only these fourteen Sahaja yogis,

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:10.620
for whom it was something out of the blue.

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:13.220
They were all flabbergasted.

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.980
They didn't know what it was.

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:23.420
And then, surprisingly, in one of our programs,

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:31.940
a lady who was possessed by some Brahmin came

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:37.660
and started saying, "Jagadamba, Jagadamba."

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:42.100
They couldn't understand. I never told them what I was, never.

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:44.380
I've never told otherwise also.

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:49.700
So then, she recited a poem

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:52.580
from Saundarya Lahari in Sanskrit language

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:54.980
and she was just a maidservant.

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:58.220
And in a man's voice.

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:02.220
So everybody was shocked

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:05.980
that the bhoots should say all these things.

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:08.540
And then she went away.

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:13.820
After that, these people started probing into it.

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:18.980
And they wanted to have My Puja, first time,

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:22.140
in My house itself.

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:30.660
Still people were not very sure they were doing the right thing.

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:32.540
Even the Brahmins they called, they said,

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:35.900
"This Saptasadi is a very difficult Puja

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:39.540
and something will happen to us."

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:41.140
But after the Puja they said,

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:45.220
"Nothing happened, we are so much better."

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:49.700
They all felt the cool breeze

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:53.500
and the entire atmosphere changed.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:56.700
They started understanding that

00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:02.380
Sahaja Yoga is the Yuga Dharma, is the one

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:10.580
of this yuga, this Kali Yuga,

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:18.460
so the Sahaj Dharma became the dharma of this yuga.

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:24.540
This yuga is very difficult, no doubt.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:31.780
But in difficulties only we become intense seekers

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:37.700
and that's what happened with all of you,

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:44.540
that you found out that everywhere

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:47.820
people were following whatever they're following,

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:51.660
they were not reaching any point.

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:54.540
Like a cocoon,

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:58.380
they're hitting their head here and there.

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:01.660
They got their realizations

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:05.940
so quickly and when they told Me

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:11.260
how they were seeking, what was happening to them,

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:15.340
I was amazed.

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:20.700
How this seeking was working within them

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:23.660
and pushed them towards Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:25.860
Also, in the meanwhile, I must say,

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:34.500
so many got lost into the clutches of false gurus.

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:40.700
Despite that, today we have so many Sahaja yogis.

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:43.500
You are just representing your country,

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:47.420
but there are many more in your countries.

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:50.140
Even in India we have many more.

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:54.820
You are just here, come to represent them.

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:57.900
So, multiple of this number,

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:00.380
I do not know how many would be there.

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:02.900
So many asked "Me how many Sahaja yogis there are". I said,

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:04.780
"I don't know."

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:05.900
Say, "You don't know?"

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:10.660
I said, "No. We have never kept any record."

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:13.140
So they can't understand. I said,

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:20.300
"We have no office, no record. I have no secretary.

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:23.300
I don't know how to type.

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:27.020
I don't know how to write even My check."

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:29.980
They can't understand

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:34.100
person like Me existing in these modern times.

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:39.220
But everything gets done, somehow.

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:44.180
Despite all My modern ignorance,

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:48.660
everything gets absolutely

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:51.380
done in the most perfect manner

00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:55.500
like a remote control.

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:58.580
Now this whole thing,

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:05.220
I never said a word about it, I must tell you, nothing.

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:11.020
Never I gave any idea as to how it should be.

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:15.700
I didn't even tell them how many we are expecting.

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:21.860
But see how spontaneously everything has worked out

00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:25.780
because you all have commitment

00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:29.420
and that commitment gives you

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:33.820
all these organizing capacities.

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:42.900
So many things you have seen get organized

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:46.780
because also this Paramchaitanya

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:51.100
has come into Krita Yuga

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:55.340
where it is working it out. It's acting.

00:17:55.340 --> 00:18:00.980
And this activity, also, is absolutely supportive to you.

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:05.860
For example, the police people told us

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:08.140
that there are Muslims living here

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:10.820
and you might have some danger from them.

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:13.300
They might do some harm to you.

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:15.460
I said, "Which Muslims are they?"

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:20.100
So they said, "Nizamuddin Aulia's people are here."

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:23.980
I said, "They'll never harm us."

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:28.100
I said, "Why? Because he was a Sufi

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:31.860
and he was a great realized soul

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:37.140
and the people who are along there, must be, most of them are,

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:41.540
at least, believers of Sufism.

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:44.700
How can they harm us?"

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:46.860
So I said, "Tomorrow, early in the morning,

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:53.260
you go and put a chador, as they call it, all of you,"

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:54.660
and they were so impressed

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:59.780
that you saw in the evening they came here all the way,

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:03.460
morning time, and they were so respectful.

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:05.620
Then they called Me, they gave Me another chador,

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:10.060
this, that and they said that we are Yours and this and that,

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:11.860
all kinds of things.

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:13.900
And his disciple was Amir Khusrau,

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:17.460
was another very, very great Sufi gentleman

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:21.180
and I always have admired his poetry

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:27.620
and also the way Nizamuddin led his life of dignity

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:31.820
and divinity.

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:34.540
All these Muslims who were there put hands towards Me like this

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:37.620
and they said, "We are feeling the cool breeze,"

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:39.860
I said, "This is Ruh."

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:42.620
"Ah, this is Ruh."

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:46.620
Once these people start getting Ruh,

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:49.140
they will all become Sahaja yogis very soon

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:52.620
and you may have to have ...

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:07.780
There are so many Sufis all over the world

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:09.860
and we are going to take their addresses

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:11.300
and we are going to meet them;

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:14.020
then you might have to have another big pendal,

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:17.820
double pendal I think, maybe triple.

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:31.980
If Delhi people are not quite frightened about the sizes,

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:36.420
I think again we'll have to have it in Delhi only.

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:55.580
Also contemporarily,

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:59.860
Delhi is in a state of turmoil

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:04.660
and we should be here to pacify it, to quieten it,

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:07.980
to give wisdom to those people

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:11.780
who are supposed to be at the helm of affairs.

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:16.260
It will work. Definitely, it will work.

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:18.660
With all these Sahaja yogis

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:21.020
emitting such beautiful, vibrations.

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:22.500
See, on top of your head

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:26.140
this cloth is moving up and down all the time,

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:29.100
though there is no breeze outside,

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:31.260
the leaves are just steady,

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:35.740
but from your head, you see, you are moving all this.

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:41.700
So I'm sure these vibrations

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:46.460
will cool down and will bring peace

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:51.220
to our politicians and to the people

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:55.620
who are at the helm of affairs.

00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:59.900
At this juncture, when in the whole world

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:04.380
there are so many things going on

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:07.340
of uncertainties,

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:10.820
say in Russia, there are uncertainties,

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:13.980
Bosnia there is uncertainties,

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:16.980
in England there's recession,

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:19.140
America there is recession,

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:21.220
Spain there is recession,

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:24.020
everybody is suffering from the pangs

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:30.060
of some sort of a extreme behavior they went into.

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:33.140
So, I'm sure this polarity

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:36.340
that they see now will correct

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:40.540
their behavior towards materialism

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:46.220
and I'm sure that a balance will be struck.

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:50.140
With your good wishes, with your prayers,

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:57.220
this world will be so beautiful,

00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:06.180
so enchanting that in the history,

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:08.500
people will describe

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:12.140
that the world itself became a lotus

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:17.500
full of fragrance of Divinity.

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:28.260
You are the petals,

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:31.980
you are the corona,

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:36.980
you are the color,

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:40.540
you are the beauty,

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:44.020
you are the pollen

00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:48.700
of that beautiful lotus

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:55.420
which is My vision of this world.

00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:58.260
I hope today

00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:04.780
you all will decide to work for Sahaja Yoga,

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:06.220
to spread Sahaja Yoga

00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:10.020
and work for yourself also.

00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:12.180
The only danger is

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:17.220
that one should not allow ego to sit on your heads.

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:22.260
That's the only horse.

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:27.060
If you could ride yourself and don't allow the horse to ride you,

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:29.340
you'll progress very fast,

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:32.540
beautifully.

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:43.580
Thus, I'm sure Sahaja Yoga will spread.

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:52.140
Every birthday we have to take a vow.

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:57.580
I don't know what vow I should take.

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:03.380
People have told Me that I should not work so hard,

00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:05.260
I'm working very hard,

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:09.620
but I have taken a vow that I'll work double hard.

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:19.620
In the same way, you also,

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:22.500
all of you, have to take a vow today

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:27.340
that we'll go all out in the commitment

00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:30.580
of working of Sahaja Yoga.

00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:33.460
We'll think about it.

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:36.300
There are scientists who should produce books,

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:38.980
there are doctors who should produce books,

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:40.460
writings,

00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:41.780
go round,

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:43.700
talk to their colleagues,

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:47.660
organize meetings,

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:51.180
seminars with your colleagues.

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:56.460
There are architects

00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:01.980
and other professionals

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:07.900
who could call their colleagues and give them realization.

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:10.620
Even the people who are dealing with finances

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:13.140
should take to Sahaja Yoga.

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:16.740
Is very important because

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:20.980
financial problems can only be

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:23.860
solved by the Divine Power.

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:27.420
Nobody else can solve it.

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:31.580
So everyone in this world,

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:37.020
whether it is law or any other field,

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:42.260
all of you should take to Sahaja Yoga

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:47.780
and also to creative work.

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:53.100
Then also, you have to take Sahaja Yoga

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:55.580
to your surroundings,

00:26:55.580 --> 00:27:02.100
to villages, to cities,

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:05.140
wherever it is possible,

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:07.540
wherever you can organize,

00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:11.420
you have to spread Sahaja Yoga everywhere.

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:14.140
As far as curing is concerned,

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:17.500
I would advise, you don't have to touch anyone.

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:20.300
Please use only My photograph.

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:23.140
That's how you'll get more Sahaja yogis

00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:27.580
and less sick people.

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:30.100
Also, people will be cured

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:33.860
and all of them will become Sahaja yogis.

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:37.460
We have also agricultural field

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:39.900
on which we have done something,

00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:45.300
but much can be done about agriculture.

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:47.980
One should see the government and tell them

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:50.380
what agriculture can do.

00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:53.460
You can form a committee and go and see them

00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:57.580
and talk to them that

00:27:57.580 --> 00:28:03.500
how agriculture can be helped by Sahaja Yoga.

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:06.140
We have to help our children.

00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:08.500
We have to look after them

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:17.700
because you know what sort of future is surrounding them,

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:20.900
what sort of atmosphere is crawling,

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:24.340
even in India.

00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:28.140
So we have to see that our children

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:31.380
properly grow in Sahaj culture.

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:34.660
Is very important

00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:38.500
because they are tomorrow's Sahaja yogis.

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:41.340
So many of them are born realized,

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:44.020
so we have to discipline them properly

00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:49.660
and we have to make them aala, "aala darza"

00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:54.220
Sahaja yogi, as described in the qawali.

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:05.660
It is also our family life which is very important.

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:07.700
Is shocking that

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:11.260
family life is nowadays becoming

00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:15.180
a kind of a stupid thing.

00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:18.380
No one understands the importance of it.

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:21.940
In Sahaja Yoga we have to understand.

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:26.660
Small quarrels, fights, should be given up.

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:32.020
Harshness must be given up, cruelty must be given up

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:37.900
and there should be a proper rapport

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:45.460
between husband and wife to begin with,

00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:49.100
so that there is a companionship

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:52.420
and the children also see that companionship

00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:56.340
and enjoy it.

00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:00.940
In our dress, in our life,

00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:05.820
we have to be dignified and decent, respecting our body.

00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:08.300
Is very important.

00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:10.780
We should wear whatever suits us

00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:13.540
in whatever country we are.

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:16.580
I mean, imagine in summer climate

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:19.340
if somebody wants to wear a three-piece suit,

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:21.780
what will happen to him?

00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:24.060
Whatever suits us,

00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:28.380
whatever fits our culture,

00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:32.940
one should try to wear decent dresses,

00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:35.660
traditional dresses.

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:38.460
Specially for women, it is very important

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:43.300
to wear dresses that will make them look more dignified.

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:53.580
Also, another point I would like to say,

00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:58.460
that ladies, specially, must take to reading,

00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:01.980
at least newspapers.

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:06.140
If your attention is on the problems

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:09.740
that are in this world, it's very effective

00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:14.580
because you know your attention is active, it works.

00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:18.900
So use your attention.

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:20.380
You see the newspapers,

00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:23.020
you watch -- I know it's horrifying sometimes

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:24.820
you can give a bandhan,

00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:28.180
but you must see what's happening where,

00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:30.980
is very important.

00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:35.900
Also men should not just read something sensational,

00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:39.060
but read something that's happening

00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:42.460
and also think, what are the solutions.

00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:45.860
How can you people, as Sahaja yogis, help it,

00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:49.140
in a collective way or in an individual way.

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:56.940
We have to solve many problems of this modern world.

00:31:56.940 --> 00:32:00.020
Also one has to read good books,

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:03.060
good films one has to see,

00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:05.780
and have your reflection on them.

00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:07.740
Keep your mind alert.

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:11.980
There are many beautiful poems I've read recently

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:13.460
coming out of

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:16.380
some people where I never expected they will write poems,

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:18.940
beautiful, very high class.

00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:22.420
So this poetry also, we are going to collect.

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:25.540
We are going to collect all the miraculous photographs

00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:27.060
from everywhere.

00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:30.460
They are trying to systematize now.

00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:32.420
And now, in this system,

00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:35.060
if you can all help spontaneously,

00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:39.500
it will be a great achievement

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:43.020
because, so far, we have not been able to collect

00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:47.220
all these datas and keep them with us.

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:52.260
Now the best is that you all must meditate.

00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:54.980
All have to meditate.

00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:57.740
Only in meditation you are in present

00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:00.540
and you grow in your spirituality.

00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:04.540
I've said it many a times, but people just don't do it.

00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:08.100
About ten minutes, if you can meditate

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:11.700
before sleeping, it's of a very great help to you,

00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:14.580
no doubt.

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:16.660
We really grow very fast.

00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:19.460
Immediately I know this man is meditating,

00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:21.620
the way he has changed.

00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:23.420
And then, once you get used to it,

00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:26.140
you'll never give it up.

00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:28.100
Is very simple meditation.

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:30.860
You have foot soaking or something like that

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:33.980
and in the morning you should beat your ego,

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:35.660
that's all.

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:38.700
Is not that you have to do

00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:42.140
one lakh jappas or something.

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:43.620
Nothing of the kind.

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:45.340
Is very simple.

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:47.540
But this, you have to do for yourself,

00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:53.860
to respect your Self-realization and your growth in divinity.

00:33:56.340 --> 00:34:03.100
We have lots of advantages over others.

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:05.380
But one thing I have to tell you,

00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:10.580
those people who are not prone to seeking,

00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:14.140
please don't talk to them about Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:17.140
Don't waste your energy on such people,

00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:19.140
discussing and arguing,

00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:21.900
because it cannot be discussed much.

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:24.580
You just forget them and leave them alone.

00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:26.180
I'll look after them.

00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:29.980
You just take to simple people, good people,

00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:34.060
who are seeking the truth.

00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:36.620
I don't want you to break your necks with those people

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:40.380
who are just believing in discussion,

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:43.740
arguments and shabda jaal.

00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:48.060
Today the Sahaja Yoga culture is so much manifesting

00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:51.180
that people, once they see you, they immediately know

00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:53.700
there's something special

00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:58.740
and that they have something very unique

00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:04.540
qualities among them which you seldom find with normal people.

00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:07.100
All these things, you should understand,

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:10.220
have come to you spontaneously from within,

00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:13.780
but you must preserve them and you should never feel shy of them.

00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:17.260
Should never be shy of your virtues.

00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:20.420
And whatever people may try

00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:22.820
to tell you that "You better do this and better do that"

00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:24.780
if it is wrong you should never do it.

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:29.620
Because, now, you are very powerful

00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:27.380
Should just say, "I don't want to do it."

00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:36.820
and that you have to lead the people

00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:38.500
and people don't have to lead you.

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:40.460
Fashions don't have to lead you,

00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:42.940
but you have to create fashions.

00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:46.660
You have to create a path for them.

00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:49.540
It's not that you have to

00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:53.500
trod on the path that they have made.

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:54.940
Try to understand

00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:58.300
that your own personality

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:03.500
is of a level where you can see so many subtle things

00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:07.140
and you are so powerful, that others don't see,

00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:12.380
then you have to automatically take up their leadership.

00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:14.460
Don't get ideas from them

00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:16.100
and don't get frightened

00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:18.580
when they try to tell you something

00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:21.500
against yourself or against Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:26.620
Be sure. Be confident. That is how it is going to work out.

00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:29.540
Now, I'm just a woman and a housewife,

00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:32.940
but I was so sure about Sahaja Yoga

00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:35.940
that it worked out.

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:39.300
I didn't have to,

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:43.500
sort of, think whether I should do it or not.

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:48.140
I just started it.

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:51.300
Though in the family it was not so much respected,

00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:55.220
not so much agreed to, doesn't matter.

00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:58.260
I started the whole thing on My own,

00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:00.100
worked it out on My own,

00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:03.420
because I had complete confidence in the truth,

00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:06.740
that if I am standing on the truth it will help Me

00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:09.820
and it will help all those who will come to Me.

00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:11.900
It has happened.

00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:14.860
So for you, it should not be difficult at all.

00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:16.660
All of you should, first of all,

00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:18.980
see that you are not a conditioned person

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:21.260
and you do not have an ego

00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:24.140
and then you should go ahead with it

00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:27.500
and you'll be amazed how things will work out.

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:31.260
Today's puja is very short puja.

00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:35.740
That's why I gave you a long lecture.

00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:39.380
There are so many things which I cannot,

00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:45.140
at this time, which is short, tell you

00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:48.100
but if you sit down, you can easily make

00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:52.220
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight yourself.

00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:55.580
So, now put your mind to it

00:37:55.580 --> 00:38:00.100
in a way that you are the organizer.

00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:02.860
Then what should you do? What can you do?

00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:04.140
What are you going to achieve?

00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:08.780
Please try and it will work out.

00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:11.260
All of you can do it.

00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:14.300
I think best is to make a diary for yourself

00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:17.340
and write it down in that: what you have done,

00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:19.420
how many people you have given realization,

00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:24.060
how many got cured, what do you think about them.

00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:26.620
But now, if there's no diary,

00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:27.940
Sahaja yogis can say among,

00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:31.020
"Mother, we have no diary, so we'll start it tomorrow." No,

00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:34.060
you start it today.

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:38.420
Only trouble with Sahaja yogis

00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:42.340
is that they take things little lightly.

00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:49.740
Of course, that is their character.

00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:53.300
But not Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:55.580
Other things you can take lightly.

00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:57.340
If somebody shouts at you,

00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:58.820
somebody gets angry with you,

00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:01.380
somebody even slaps you, take it lightly.

00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:04.340
Doesn't matter, makes no difference to you,

00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:06.300
because you are the spirit.

00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:07.900
Nothing can destroy the spirit.

00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:10.780
Nainam Chidanti Shastrani.

00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:15.140
But when it comes to Sahaja Yoga,

00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:17.420
your attitude should be different.

00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:19.620
If you are relaxing on one side,

00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:22.980
another side you have to be dynamic

00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:25.860
and that side is where you have to put forward

00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:27.420
the theories of Sahaja Yoga,

00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:29.180
when you have to talk to people,

00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:31.460
you have to organize a press conference

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:33.580
or whatever sort of thing you want to do.

00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:35.580
At whatever level you want to work it out,

00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:38.020
please make a proper plan about it

00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:40.140
and just do it.

00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:44.500
It will all work out. I'm sure it will work out.

00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:50.180
With all these ideas that I have,

00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:54.300
you have many more

00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:58.260
and I hope by next year,

00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:00.980
we'll see manifestation of those.

00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:03.140
I hope many people will write books

00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:05.460
like U.C. Rai has written.

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:11.380
I'm sure books can be written by every doctor.

00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:14.220
Doctor U.C. Rai has worked single-handed.

00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:16.940
Everything he has done single-handed.

00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:19.660
So beautifully he has worked it out.

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:25.140
So, everybody can publish a book with their experiences,

00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:28.420
with their understanding of Sahaja Yoga,

00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:31.380
which will help Sahaja yogis also.

00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:36.500
But it should be honest, very honest book.

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:39.900
I'm sure such a book will be very much appreciated

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:44.500
in Sahaja Yoga and we would like to publish such books also.

00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:46.700
All those who have such ideas

00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:52.300
should make an effort to create some new books,

00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:57.540
some new ideas, some new creation.

00:40:57.540 --> 00:40:59.580
Is very important

00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:01.620
because in these modern times

00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:04.900
people want to do something new,

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:07.820
something novel.

00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:10.620
Under these circumstances,

00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:13.420
I'm sure you all will work out.

00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:17.500
So, all the time we have to think about Sahaja Yoga

00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:22.620
and jot it down whatever ideas are coming into your mind

00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:26.460
and then these can be properly put together,

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:30.420
making a beautiful book of Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:33.420
Ladies also have lots of chances of doing

00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:36.700
so many things for Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:44.340
This is a very opportune time.

00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:53.420
I think Satya Yuga is starting from tomorrow. No doubt.

00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:14.460
And what will be the symptom

00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:20.380
that now the satya will be victorious, vijaya.

00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:31.420
Whatever people may try,

00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:34.340
ultimately satya will be vijaya.

00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:35.820
Satyame vijayate.

00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:40.740
That's going to happen and you are responsible.

00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:48.580
For this I congratulate you again and again.

00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:52.260
And I hope you will have the commitment to do that.

00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:55.820
May God bless you all.
