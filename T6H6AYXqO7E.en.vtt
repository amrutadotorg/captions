00:02.900 --> 00:12.500
Is very difficult to speak, even for Me

00:20.900 --> 00:27.980
to see so many Sahaja yogis

00:30.020 --> 00:38.380
sitting here with such shining faces

00:38.380 --> 00:41.900
from all over the world,

00:44.340 --> 00:51.540
as if My vision has taken its form today.

00:58.620 --> 01:07.260
I see in you the saviors of tomorrow

01:07.260 --> 01:11.420
who are going to save this world

01:11.740 --> 01:16.660
from all the Kali Yuga calamities

01:16.900 --> 01:20.260
that are surrounding us.

01:21.220 --> 01:24.980
Is coming from all sides,

01:25.940 --> 01:33.380
while you people have really taken your second birth

01:33.660 --> 01:37.860
from this pond of Kali Yuga

01:37.860 --> 01:43.540
and have really become beautiful lotuses of different colors,

01:43.540 --> 01:48.340
hues, fragrance and beauty.

01:48.980 --> 01:53.540
Instead of you celebrating My birthday,

01:53.540 --> 01:58.580
is better I celebrate your birthdays.

02:04.140 --> 02:06.380
As I told you the other day that

02:06.380 --> 02:16.220
it is you who are such great seekers, seekers of truth, of love,

02:16.220 --> 02:19.020
that it could work out,

02:21.740 --> 02:24.660
otherwise it would have been impossible.

02:24.660 --> 02:29.140
To even transform one person is very difficult,

02:29.140 --> 02:33.660
but you were so sensitive

02:33.660 --> 02:39.020
and so deep that this subtle knowledge,

02:39.020 --> 02:44.780
I don't know how it penetrated your being.

02:45.300 --> 02:47.340
It's unbelievable.

02:47.340 --> 02:51.220
I can't believe Myself

02:51.740 --> 02:59.260
what great people have taken birth in this Kali Yuga.

02:59.900 --> 03:03.380
No one can believe that there are so many

03:03.380 --> 03:05.900
saints are sitting before Me, so many Walis;

03:05.900 --> 03:09.620
so many Nalis are sitting before Me.

03:12.780 --> 03:18.220
In the history of spirituality it has never happened.

03:18.900 --> 03:23.180
Even in the heavens there are few devatas

03:23.180 --> 03:26.500
and devas, not so many.

03:27.620 --> 03:30.460
One better than the other

03:30.700 --> 03:36.940
such beautiful heart,

03:38.860 --> 03:42.940
such brilliant brains

03:43.260 --> 03:55.780
and such active attention, is really

03:55.780 --> 04:02.500
I thank you all that this seventieth birthday I could see

04:02.500 --> 04:07.100
so many people, which I never expected.

04:07.100 --> 04:11.940
You know, Sahaja Yoga was started with one person

04:11.940 --> 04:16.100
and then those who came also,

04:16.100 --> 04:21.940
out of them, some were power-oriented, money-oriented,

04:21.940 --> 04:26.340
all kinds of people created problems for us.

04:26.340 --> 04:29.900
One after another, so many problems came

04:29.900 --> 04:33.220
and also there were many who were

04:33.220 --> 04:37.780
of a very low-level seekers.

04:37.780 --> 04:44.140
But I find today they have all come up beautifully.

04:44.820 --> 04:50.060
I cannot distinguish one from another,

04:50.060 --> 04:52.780
the way it has happened.

04:52.780 --> 04:56.260
And the commitment you have to Sahaja Yoga

04:56.260 --> 05:02.500
is the greatest blessings for this world.

05:02.500 --> 05:08.140
I could not do it alone. You know that.

05:08.140 --> 05:13.380
If I could do it, I would not have needed you.

05:13.380 --> 05:16.340
You are the channels

05:16.580 --> 05:22.900
and you have to work it out further and further.

05:24.940 --> 05:30.340
It is really remarkable the way

05:30.340 --> 05:34.660
Delhi people have organized everything.

05:48.220 --> 05:51.300
First of all, everybody was very much

05:51.300 --> 05:54.140
keyed onto the seventieth birthday.

05:54.140 --> 05:59.460
I don't know what was the reason, but whatever it is,

05:59.460 --> 06:00.820
and then Delhi people said,

06:00.820 --> 06:02.820
"This time we are going to celebrate,

06:02.820 --> 06:05.780
Mother, Your birthday in Delhi."

06:06.060 --> 06:10.900
I said, "Everybody's ... on it, so be careful,

06:10.900 --> 06:14.940
it's not going to be easy. It's a big headache.

06:16.500 --> 06:19.260
So many will be coming down."

06:19.260 --> 06:22.860
But they didn't expect so much, I'm sure

06:24.740 --> 06:27.060
... people are coming. Hundred are coming from there,

06:27.060 --> 06:31.260
hundred from there. I said, "Are you worried?"

06:31.260 --> 06:34.580
They said, "No we are very happy about it."

06:34.580 --> 06:39.100
I saw their enthusiasm, their organization,

06:40.100 --> 06:41.780
the way they have done it.

06:41.780 --> 06:43.700
The best part of it,

06:43.940 --> 06:49.060
Delhi, which is a place where all kinds of politicians live,

06:49.340 --> 06:52.260
have groups and politics and all that,

06:52.260 --> 06:57.540
but in Sahaja Yoga in Delhi there is no politics.

07:07.820 --> 07:10.380
There is no quarrelling.

07:10.820 --> 07:13.300
There is no pulling each other's legs.

07:13.300 --> 07:16.140
Is very remarkable thing

07:16.140 --> 07:19.260
it to happen in a place like Delhi,

07:19.260 --> 07:21.380
where every day what you hear

07:21.380 --> 07:26.700
that even in our parliament they are beating each other.

07:27.980 --> 07:30.540
Perhaps, in this hell only,

07:30.540 --> 07:34.420
this goodness was to be born and

07:34.420 --> 07:37.500
to be manifested by Sahaja yogis.

07:37.500 --> 07:40.220
The knowledge of Sahaja Yoga,

07:40.220 --> 07:45.340
as you know, is extremely, extremely subtle

07:46.500 --> 07:49.980
and it's not easy

07:50.740 --> 07:57.500
to penetrate into the so-called

07:57.500 --> 08:00.980
people who call themselves intellectuals

08:00.980 --> 08:09.100
or who are absolutely bowed down to their conditionings.

08:09.940 --> 08:14.180
So, on one side, we have the masses who are ignorant,

08:14.180 --> 08:18.980
another side the classes who live in the frame

08:18.980 --> 08:22.620
that they have made out of their brains.

08:24.500 --> 08:28.620
Both ways, I think, they are extremely gross.

08:29.140 --> 08:35.020
But the way they have absorbed

08:35.020 --> 08:44.220
this subtle nectar of Divinity is something unbelievable.

08:47.060 --> 08:50.980
Nobody can comprehend even

08:53.220 --> 09:03.620
that there were so many born after My birth,

09:03.620 --> 09:07.100
on this Earth,

09:07.300 --> 09:12.060
or some maybe before also, very few.

09:12.060 --> 09:15.860
Just after My birth they were born here

09:18.620 --> 09:23.220
in this world, to get to Sahaja Yoga.

09:23.100 --> 09:28.620
But when I saw the world I was shocked,

09:28.620 --> 09:31.180
more shocked than Kabira, himself.

09:31.180 --> 09:35.980
I said, "How will I talk to anyone about it?"

09:36.540 --> 09:38.140
My family members,

09:38.140 --> 09:42.620
I didn't know how will I open the subject to them.

09:43.700 --> 09:50.860
Was impossible, so much was darkness of ignorance.

09:52.660 --> 09:58.460
How will they believe that there is really Divinity,

09:58.940 --> 10:03.580
there is totality waiting for them?

10:03.580 --> 10:07.700
They all believed into some sort of a religion,

10:07.700 --> 10:11.020
which had no connection with reality.

10:13.340 --> 10:17.940
And it was impossible even to envisage

10:17.940 --> 10:22.060
the method by which I could talk to them.

10:22.300 --> 10:25.180
I remember the first incident

10:25.180 --> 10:32.580
when we went to Nargol, where I had opened the Sahasrara.

10:33.220 --> 10:38.900
The first person who got realization was a Gujarati and a jeweler.

10:39.220 --> 10:42.700
Immediately, all the other,

10:42.700 --> 10:46.220
there were hardly about thirty-five people

10:46.220 --> 10:47.780
they started saying that

10:47.780 --> 10:50.580
"Of course, he's a rich man, he's a jeweler,

10:50.580 --> 10:53.380
so Mother has given him realization."

10:53.380 --> 10:57.420
I think that's the first time and last time I really got angry.

10:57.980 --> 11:01.340
I started shouting at them,

11:01.340 --> 11:03.340
"You are good for nothing, useless people,

11:03.340 --> 11:06.220
you can never take to Divinity,"

11:06.220 --> 11:08.980
and I had really thought that "Stop it now."

11:08.980 --> 11:11.500
One has to take another life,

11:11.500 --> 11:17.220
another time where people will understand what is Sahaja Yoga.

11:17.460 --> 11:22.260
But after that, suddenly,

11:22.260 --> 11:25.540
people started feeling the cool breeze in their hands,

11:25.540 --> 11:30.420
immediately, after My shouting. Imagine.

11:30.420 --> 11:36.940
And they said, "Mother, You know, it's working.

11:36.940 --> 11:39.820
It's working in us. It's working out of us."

11:39.820 --> 11:44.540
Thus, we got twelve people

11:44.540 --> 11:51.700
and one lady whom I had given before also,

11:52.780 --> 11:55.860
she was the fourteenth.

11:59.420 --> 12:03.740
Thus, first we had only these fourteen Sahaja yogis,

12:05.060 --> 12:10.620
for whom it was something out of the blue.

12:10.620 --> 12:13.220
They were all flabbergasted.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.980
They didn't know what it was.

12:19.180 --> 12:23.420
And then, surprisingly, in one of our programs,

12:23.420 --> 12:31.940
a lady who was possessed by some Brahmin came

12:32.140 --> 12:37.660
and started saying, "Jagadamba, Jagadamba."

12:37.660 --> 12:42.100
They couldn't understand. I never told them what I was, never.

12:42.100 --> 12:44.380
I've never told otherwise also.

12:46.100 --> 12:49.700
So then, she recited a poem

12:49.700 --> 12:52.580
from Saundarya Lahari in Sanskrit language

12:52.580 --> 12:54.980
and she was just a maidservant.

12:55.220 --> 12:58.220
And in a man's voice.

13:00.420 --> 13:02.220
So everybody was shocked

13:02.540 --> 13:05.980
that the bhoots should say all these things.

13:05.980 --> 13:08.540
And then she went away.

13:08.540 --> 13:13.820
After that, these people started probing into it.

13:14.620 --> 13:18.980
And they wanted to have My Puja, first time,

13:18.980 --> 13:22.140
in My house itself.

13:22.420 --> 13:30.660
Still people were not very sure they were doing the right thing.

13:30.660 --> 13:32.540
Even the Brahmins they called, they said,

13:32.540 --> 13:35.900
"This Saptasadi is a very difficult Puja

13:35.900 --> 13:39.540
and something will happen to us."

13:39.540 --> 13:41.140
But after the Puja they said,

13:41.500 --> 13:45.220
"Nothing happened, we are so much better."

13:45.220 --> 13:49.700
They all felt the cool breeze

13:49.700 --> 13:53.500
and the entire atmosphere changed.

13:53.500 --> 13:56.700
They started understanding that

13:56.700 --> 14:02.380
Sahaja Yoga is the Yuga Dharma, is the one

14:03.580 --> 14:10.580
of this yuga, this Kali Yuga,

14:11.260 --> 14:18.460
so the Sahaj Dharma became the dharma of this yuga.

14:21.020 --> 14:24.540
This yuga is very difficult, no doubt.

14:25.260 --> 14:31.780
But in difficulties only we become intense seekers

14:31.780 --> 14:37.700
and that's what happened with all of you,

14:37.700 --> 14:44.540
that you found out that everywhere

14:44.540 --> 14:47.820
people were following whatever they're following,

14:47.820 --> 14:51.660
they were not reaching any point.

14:51.660 --> 14:54.540
Like a cocoon,

14:54.540 --> 14:58.380
they're hitting their head here and there.

14:58.380 --> 15:01.660
They got their realizations

15:01.980 --> 15:05.940
so quickly and when they told Me

15:08.140 --> 15:11.260
how they were seeking, what was happening to them,

15:11.260 --> 15:15.340
I was amazed.

15:17.580 --> 15:20.700
How this seeking was working within them

15:20.700 --> 15:23.660
and pushed them towards Sahaja Yoga.

15:23.660 --> 15:25.860
Also, in the meanwhile, I must say,

15:25.860 --> 15:34.500
so many got lost into the clutches of false gurus.

15:34.500 --> 15:40.700
Despite that, today we have so many Sahaja yogis.

15:40.700 --> 15:43.500
You are just representing your country,

15:43.500 --> 15:47.420
but there are many more in your countries.

15:47.420 --> 15:50.140
Even in India we have many more.

15:50.140 --> 15:54.820
You are just here, come to represent them.

15:54.820 --> 15:57.900
So, multiple of this number,

15:57.900 --> 16:00.380
I do not know how many would be there.

16:00.380 --> 16:02.900
So many asked "Me how many Sahaja yogis there are". I said,

16:03.100 --> 16:04.780
"I don't know."

16:04.780 --> 16:05.900
Say, "You don't know?"

16:06.260 --> 16:10.660
I said, "No. We have never kept any record."

16:10.660 --> 16:13.140
So they can't understand. I said,

16:13.140 --> 16:20.300
"We have no office, no record. I have no secretary.

16:21.180 --> 16:23.300
I don't know how to type.

16:23.300 --> 16:27.020
I don't know how to write even My check."

16:27.940 --> 16:29.980
They can't understand

16:29.860 --> 16:34.100
person like Me existing in these modern times.

16:35.500 --> 16:39.220
But everything gets done, somehow.

16:40.340 --> 16:44.180
Despite all My modern ignorance,

16:44.180 --> 16:48.660
everything gets absolutely

16:48.660 --> 16:51.380
done in the most perfect manner

16:51.380 --> 16:55.500
like a remote control.

16:55.500 --> 16:58.580
Now this whole thing,

16:59.780 --> 17:05.220
I never said a word about it, I must tell you, nothing.

17:05.220 --> 17:11.020
Never I gave any idea as to how it should be.

17:11.020 --> 17:15.700
I didn't even tell them how many we are expecting.

17:16.780 --> 17:21.860
But see how spontaneously everything has worked out

17:21.860 --> 17:25.780
because you all have commitment

17:26.100 --> 17:29.420
and that commitment gives you

17:29.420 --> 17:33.820
all these organizing capacities.

17:37.340 --> 17:42.900
So many things you have seen get organized

17:42.900 --> 17:46.780
because also this Paramchaitanya

17:46.780 --> 17:51.100
has come into Krita Yuga

17:51.100 --> 17:55.340
where it is working it out. It's acting.

17:55.340 --> 18:00.980
And this activity, also, is absolutely supportive to you.

18:02.580 --> 18:05.860
For example, the police people told us

18:05.860 --> 18:08.140
that there are Muslims living here

18:08.140 --> 18:10.820
and you might have some danger from them.

18:10.820 --> 18:13.300
They might do some harm to you.

18:13.300 --> 18:15.460
I said, "Which Muslims are they?"

18:15.460 --> 18:20.100
So they said, "Nizamuddin Aulia's people are here."

18:21.380 --> 18:23.980
I said, "They'll never harm us."

18:23.980 --> 18:28.100
I said, "Why? Because he was a Sufi

18:28.100 --> 18:31.860
and he was a great realized soul

18:31.860 --> 18:37.140
and the people who are along there, must be, most of them are,

18:37.140 --> 18:41.540
at least, believers of Sufism.

18:41.540 --> 18:44.700
How can they harm us?"

18:44.700 --> 18:46.860
So I said, "Tomorrow, early in the morning,

18:46.860 --> 18:53.260
you go and put a chador, as they call it, all of you,"

18:53.260 --> 18:54.660
and they were so impressed

18:54.660 --> 18:59.780
that you saw in the evening they came here all the way,

18:59.780 --> 19:03.460
morning time, and they were so respectful.

19:03.460 --> 19:05.620
Then they called Me, they gave Me another chador,

19:05.620 --> 19:10.060
this, that and they said that we are Yours and this and that,

19:10.060 --> 19:11.860
all kinds of things.

19:11.860 --> 19:13.900
And his disciple was Amir Khusrau,

19:13.900 --> 19:17.460
was another very, very great Sufi gentleman

19:17.460 --> 19:21.180
and I always have admired his poetry

19:21.180 --> 19:27.620
and also the way Nizamuddin led his life of dignity

19:27.620 --> 19:31.820
and divinity.

19:30.740 --> 19:34.540
All these Muslims who were there put hands towards Me like this

19:34.540 --> 19:37.620
and they said, "We are feeling the cool breeze,"

19:37.620 --> 19:39.860
I said, "This is Ruh."

19:39.860 --> 19:42.620
"Ah, this is Ruh."

19:43.940 --> 19:46.620
Once these people start getting Ruh,

19:46.620 --> 19:49.140
they will all become Sahaja yogis very soon

19:49.140 --> 19:52.620
and you may have to have ...

20:03.740 --> 20:07.780
There are so many Sufis all over the world

20:07.780 --> 20:09.860
and we are going to take their addresses

20:09.860 --> 20:11.300
and we are going to meet them;

20:11.300 --> 20:14.020
then you might have to have another big pendal,

20:14.020 --> 20:17.820
double pendal I think, maybe triple.

20:24.100 --> 20:31.980
If Delhi people are not quite frightened about the sizes,

20:31.980 --> 20:36.420
I think again we'll have to have it in Delhi only.

20:52.500 --> 20:55.580
Also contemporarily,

20:56.220 --> 20:59.860
Delhi is in a state of turmoil

20:59.860 --> 21:04.660
and we should be here to pacify it, to quieten it,

21:04.660 --> 21:07.980
to give wisdom to those people

21:07.980 --> 21:11.780
who are supposed to be at the helm of affairs.

21:12.220 --> 21:16.260
It will work. Definitely, it will work.

21:16.260 --> 21:18.660
With all these Sahaja yogis

21:18.660 --> 21:21.020
emitting such beautiful, vibrations.

21:21.020 --> 21:22.500
See, on top of your head

21:22.500 --> 21:26.140
this cloth is moving up and down all the time,

21:26.380 --> 21:29.100
though there is no breeze outside,

21:29.100 --> 21:31.260
the leaves are just steady,

21:31.260 --> 21:35.740
but from your head, you see, you are moving all this.

21:38.740 --> 21:41.700
So I'm sure these vibrations

21:41.700 --> 21:46.460
will cool down and will bring peace

21:46.460 --> 21:51.220
to our politicians and to the people

21:51.220 --> 21:55.620
who are at the helm of affairs.

21:55.620 --> 21:59.900
At this juncture, when in the whole world

21:59.900 --> 22:04.380
there are so many things going on

22:04.380 --> 22:07.340
of uncertainties,

22:07.740 --> 22:10.820
say in Russia, there are uncertainties,

22:10.820 --> 22:13.980
Bosnia there is uncertainties,

22:13.980 --> 22:16.980
in England there's recession,

22:16.980 --> 22:19.140
America there is recession,

22:19.420 --> 22:21.220
Spain there is recession,

22:21.220 --> 22:24.020
everybody is suffering from the pangs

22:24.300 --> 22:30.060
of some sort of a extreme behavior they went into.

22:30.580 --> 22:33.140
So, I'm sure this polarity

22:33.140 --> 22:36.340
that they see now will correct

22:36.700 --> 22:40.540
their behavior towards materialism

22:40.540 --> 22:46.220
and I'm sure that a balance will be struck.

22:46.460 --> 22:50.140
With your good wishes, with your prayers,

22:50.140 --> 22:57.220
this world will be so beautiful,

22:57.220 --> 23:06.180
so enchanting that in the history,

23:06.180 --> 23:08.500
people will describe

23:08.500 --> 23:12.140
that the world itself became a lotus

23:12.140 --> 23:17.500
full of fragrance of Divinity.

23:25.780 --> 23:28.260
You are the petals,

23:29.740 --> 23:31.980
you are the corona,

23:34.500 --> 23:36.980
you are the color,

23:38.060 --> 23:40.540
you are the beauty,

23:42.100 --> 23:44.020
you are the pollen

23:44.780 --> 23:48.700
of that beautiful lotus

23:51.860 --> 23:55.420
which is My vision of this world.

23:55.420 --> 23:58.260
I hope today

23:58.260 --> 24:04.780
you all will decide to work for Sahaja Yoga,

24:04.780 --> 24:06.220
to spread Sahaja Yoga

24:06.220 --> 24:10.020
and work for yourself also.

24:10.260 --> 24:12.180
The only danger is

24:12.180 --> 24:17.220
that one should not allow ego to sit on your heads.

24:17.460 --> 24:22.260
That's the only horse.

24:22.260 --> 24:27.060
If you could ride yourself and don't allow the horse to ride you,

24:27.060 --> 24:29.340
you'll progress very fast,

24:29.340 --> 24:32.540
beautifully.

24:35.620 --> 24:43.580
Thus, I'm sure Sahaja Yoga will spread.

24:43.580 --> 24:52.140
Every birthday we have to take a vow.

24:52.420 --> 24:57.580
I don't know what vow I should take.

25:00.700 --> 25:03.380
People have told Me that I should not work so hard,

25:03.380 --> 25:05.260
I'm working very hard,

25:05.260 --> 25:09.620
but I have taken a vow that I'll work double hard.

25:17.740 --> 25:19.620
In the same way, you also,

25:19.620 --> 25:22.500
all of you, have to take a vow today

25:22.500 --> 25:27.340
that we'll go all out in the commitment

25:27.340 --> 25:30.580
of working of Sahaja Yoga.

25:30.580 --> 25:33.460
We'll think about it.

25:33.460 --> 25:36.300
There are scientists who should produce books,

25:36.300 --> 25:38.980
there are doctors who should produce books,

25:38.980 --> 25:40.460
writings,

25:40.460 --> 25:41.780
go round,

25:41.780 --> 25:43.700
talk to their colleagues,

25:43.700 --> 25:47.660
organize meetings,

25:47.660 --> 25:51.180
seminars with your colleagues.

25:53.580 --> 25:56.460
There are architects

25:57.420 --> 26:01.980
and other professionals

26:02.540 --> 26:07.900
who could call their colleagues and give them realization.

26:07.900 --> 26:10.620
Even the people who are dealing with finances

26:10.620 --> 26:13.140
should take to Sahaja Yoga.

26:13.140 --> 26:16.740
Is very important because

26:16.740 --> 26:20.980
financial problems can only be

26:21.140 --> 26:23.860
solved by the Divine Power.

26:23.860 --> 26:27.420
Nobody else can solve it.

26:27.820 --> 26:31.580
So everyone in this world,

26:31.580 --> 26:37.020
whether it is law or any other field,

26:37.020 --> 26:42.260
all of you should take to Sahaja Yoga

26:43.140 --> 26:47.780
and also to creative work.

26:48.700 --> 26:53.100
Then also, you have to take Sahaja Yoga

26:53.100 --> 26:55.580
to your surroundings,

26:55.580 --> 27:02.100
to villages, to cities,

27:02.100 --> 27:05.140
wherever it is possible,

27:05.140 --> 27:07.540
wherever you can organize,

27:07.540 --> 27:11.420
you have to spread Sahaja Yoga everywhere.

27:11.420 --> 27:14.140
As far as curing is concerned,

27:14.140 --> 27:17.500
I would advise, you don't have to touch anyone.

27:17.500 --> 27:20.300
Please use only My photograph.

27:20.300 --> 27:23.140
That's how you'll get more Sahaja yogis

27:23.140 --> 27:27.580
and less sick people.

27:27.580 --> 27:30.100
Also, people will be cured

27:30.100 --> 27:33.860
and all of them will become Sahaja yogis.

27:34.140 --> 27:37.460
We have also agricultural field

27:37.460 --> 27:39.900
on which we have done something,

27:39.900 --> 27:45.300
but much can be done about agriculture.

27:45.300 --> 27:47.980
One should see the government and tell them

27:47.980 --> 27:50.380
what agriculture can do.

27:50.380 --> 27:53.460
You can form a committee and go and see them

27:55.780 --> 27:57.580
and talk to them that

27:57.580 --> 28:03.500
how agriculture can be helped by Sahaja Yoga.

28:03.500 --> 28:06.140
We have to help our children.

28:06.140 --> 28:08.500
We have to look after them

28:08.500 --> 28:17.700
because you know what sort of future is surrounding them,

28:17.700 --> 28:20.900
what sort of atmosphere is crawling,

28:20.900 --> 28:24.340
even in India.

28:24.340 --> 28:28.140
So we have to see that our children

28:28.140 --> 28:31.380
properly grow in Sahaj culture.

28:32.660 --> 28:34.660
Is very important

28:34.660 --> 28:38.500
because they are tomorrow's Sahaja yogis.

28:38.500 --> 28:41.340
So many of them are born realized,

28:41.340 --> 28:44.020
so we have to discipline them properly

28:44.020 --> 28:49.660
and we have to make them aala, "aala darza"

28:49.660 --> 28:54.220
Sahaja yogi, as described in the qawali.

28:58.700 --> 29:05.660
It is also our family life which is very important.

29:05.900 --> 29:07.700
Is shocking that

29:07.700 --> 29:11.260
family life is nowadays becoming

29:11.260 --> 29:15.180
a kind of a stupid thing.

29:15.180 --> 29:18.380
No one understands the importance of it.

29:18.380 --> 29:21.940
In Sahaja Yoga we have to understand.

29:21.940 --> 29:26.660
Small quarrels, fights, should be given up.

29:26.660 --> 29:32.020
Harshness must be given up, cruelty must be given up

29:31.980 --> 29:37.900
and there should be a proper rapport

29:37.900 --> 29:45.460
between husband and wife to begin with,

29:45.460 --> 29:49.100
so that there is a companionship

29:49.100 --> 29:52.420
and the children also see that companionship

29:52.420 --> 29:56.340
and enjoy it.

29:57.500 --> 30:00.940
In our dress, in our life,

30:00.940 --> 30:05.820
we have to be dignified and decent, respecting our body.

30:06.540 --> 30:08.300
Is very important.

30:08.500 --> 30:10.780
We should wear whatever suits us

30:10.780 --> 30:13.540
in whatever country we are.

30:14.300 --> 30:16.580
I mean, imagine in summer climate

30:16.580 --> 30:19.340
if somebody wants to wear a three-piece suit,

30:19.580 --> 30:21.780
what will happen to him?

30:22.460 --> 30:24.060
Whatever suits us,

30:24.060 --> 30:28.380
whatever fits our culture,

30:28.380 --> 30:32.940
one should try to wear decent dresses,

30:32.940 --> 30:35.660
traditional dresses.

30:35.900 --> 30:38.460
Specially for women, it is very important

30:38.460 --> 30:43.300
to wear dresses that will make them look more dignified.

30:50.380 --> 30:53.580
Also, another point I would like to say,

30:53.580 --> 30:58.460
that ladies, specially, must take to reading,

30:59.140 --> 31:01.980
at least newspapers.

31:02.300 --> 31:06.140
If your attention is on the problems

31:06.140 --> 31:09.740
that are in this world, it's very effective

31:09.740 --> 31:14.580
because you know your attention is active, it works.

31:16.380 --> 31:18.900
So use your attention.

31:18.900 --> 31:20.380
You see the newspapers,

31:20.380 --> 31:23.020
you watch -- I know it's horrifying sometimes

31:23.020 --> 31:24.820
you can give a bandhan,

31:24.820 --> 31:28.180
but you must see what's happening where,

31:28.180 --> 31:30.980
is very important.

31:30.980 --> 31:35.900
Also men should not just read something sensational,

31:35.900 --> 31:39.060
but read something that's happening

31:39.060 --> 31:42.460
and also think, what are the solutions.

31:42.460 --> 31:45.860
How can you people, as Sahaja yogis, help it,

31:45.860 --> 31:49.140
in a collective way or in an individual way.

31:49.140 --> 31:56.940
We have to solve many problems of this modern world.

31:56.940 --> 32:00.020
Also one has to read good books,

32:00.020 --> 32:03.060
good films one has to see,

32:03.060 --> 32:05.780
and have your reflection on them.

32:05.780 --> 32:07.740
Keep your mind alert.

32:07.740 --> 32:11.980
There are many beautiful poems I've read recently

32:11.980 --> 32:13.460
coming out of

32:13.460 --> 32:16.380
some people where I never expected they will write poems,

32:16.380 --> 32:18.940
beautiful, very high class.

32:19.140 --> 32:22.420
So this poetry also, we are going to collect.

32:22.420 --> 32:25.540
We are going to collect all the miraculous photographs

32:25.540 --> 32:27.060
from everywhere.

32:27.060 --> 32:30.460
They are trying to systematize now.

32:30.460 --> 32:32.420
And now, in this system,

32:32.420 --> 32:35.060
if you can all help spontaneously,

32:35.060 --> 32:39.500
it will be a great achievement

32:39.500 --> 32:43.020
because, so far, we have not been able to collect

32:43.020 --> 32:47.220
all these datas and keep them with us.

32:49.140 --> 32:52.260
Now the best is that you all must meditate.

32:52.260 --> 32:54.980
All have to meditate.

32:54.980 --> 32:57.740
Only in meditation you are in present

32:57.740 --> 33:00.540
and you grow in your spirituality.

33:00.540 --> 33:04.540
I've said it many a times, but people just don't do it.

33:04.540 --> 33:08.100
About ten minutes, if you can meditate

33:08.100 --> 33:11.700
before sleeping, it's of a very great help to you,

33:12.900 --> 33:14.580
no doubt.

33:14.940 --> 33:16.660
We really grow very fast.

33:16.660 --> 33:19.460
Immediately I know this man is meditating,

33:19.460 --> 33:21.620
the way he has changed.

33:21.620 --> 33:23.420
And then, once you get used to it,

33:23.660 --> 33:26.140
you'll never give it up.

33:26.140 --> 33:28.100
Is very simple meditation.

33:28.100 --> 33:30.860
You have foot soaking or something like that

33:30.860 --> 33:33.980
and in the morning you should beat your ego,

33:33.980 --> 33:35.660
that's all.

33:36.420 --> 33:38.700
Is not that you have to do

33:38.700 --> 33:42.140
one lakh jappas or something.

33:42.140 --> 33:43.620
Nothing of the kind.

33:43.620 --> 33:45.340
Is very simple.

33:45.340 --> 33:47.540
But this, you have to do for yourself,

33:47.540 --> 33:53.860
to respect your Self-realization and your growth in divinity.

33:56.340 --> 34:03.100
We have lots of advantages over others.

34:03.100 --> 34:05.380
But one thing I have to tell you,

34:05.380 --> 34:10.580
those people who are not prone to seeking,

34:10.580 --> 34:14.140
please don't talk to them about Sahaja Yoga.

34:14.140 --> 34:17.140
Don't waste your energy on such people,

34:17.140 --> 34:19.140
discussing and arguing,

34:19.140 --> 34:21.900
because it cannot be discussed much.

34:21.900 --> 34:24.580
You just forget them and leave them alone.

34:24.580 --> 34:26.180
I'll look after them.

34:26.180 --> 34:29.980
You just take to simple people, good people,

34:29.980 --> 34:34.060
who are seeking the truth.

34:34.060 --> 34:36.620
I don't want you to break your necks with those people

34:36.620 --> 34:40.380
who are just believing in discussion,

34:40.300 --> 34:43.740
arguments and shabda jaal.

34:43.740 --> 34:48.060
Today the Sahaja Yoga culture is so much manifesting

34:48.060 --> 34:51.180
that people, once they see you, they immediately know

34:51.180 --> 34:53.700
there's something special

34:53.940 --> 34:58.740
and that they have something very unique

34:58.740 --> 35:04.540
qualities among them which you seldom find with normal people.

35:04.540 --> 35:07.100
All these things, you should understand,

35:07.100 --> 35:10.220
have come to you spontaneously from within,

35:10.220 --> 35:13.780
but you must preserve them and you should never feel shy of them.

35:13.780 --> 35:17.260
Should never be shy of your virtues.

35:18.580 --> 35:20.420
And whatever people may try

35:20.420 --> 35:22.820
to tell you that "You better do this and better do that"

35:22.820 --> 35:24.780
if it is wrong you should never do it.

35:23.460 --> 35:29.620
Because, now, you are very powerful

35:24.780 --> 35:27.380
Should just say, "I don't want to do it."

35:34.580 --> 35:36.820
and that you have to lead the people

35:36.820 --> 35:38.500
and people don't have to lead you.

35:38.500 --> 35:40.460
Fashions don't have to lead you,

35:40.460 --> 35:42.940
but you have to create fashions.

35:42.940 --> 35:46.660
You have to create a path for them.

35:46.660 --> 35:49.540
It's not that you have to

35:49.540 --> 35:53.500
trod on the path that they have made.

35:53.500 --> 35:54.940
Try to understand

35:54.940 --> 35:58.300
that your own personality

35:58.300 --> 36:03.500
is of a level where you can see so many subtle things

36:03.500 --> 36:07.140
and you are so powerful, that others don't see,

36:07.140 --> 36:12.380
then you have to automatically take up their leadership.

36:12.380 --> 36:14.460
Don't get ideas from them

36:14.460 --> 36:16.100
and don't get frightened

36:16.100 --> 36:18.580
when they try to tell you something

36:18.580 --> 36:21.500
against yourself or against Sahaja Yoga.

36:21.500 --> 36:26.620
Be sure. Be confident. That is how it is going to work out.

36:26.620 --> 36:29.540
Now, I'm just a woman and a housewife,

36:29.540 --> 36:32.940
but I was so sure about Sahaja Yoga

36:32.940 --> 36:35.940
that it worked out.

36:37.820 --> 36:39.300
I didn't have to,

36:39.300 --> 36:43.500
sort of, think whether I should do it or not.

36:43.500 --> 36:48.140
I just started it.

36:48.580 --> 36:51.300
Though in the family it was not so much respected,

36:51.500 --> 36:55.220
not so much agreed to, doesn't matter.

36:55.220 --> 36:58.260
I started the whole thing on My own,

36:58.260 --> 37:00.100
worked it out on My own,

37:00.100 --> 37:03.420
because I had complete confidence in the truth,

37:03.420 --> 37:06.740
that if I am standing on the truth it will help Me

37:06.740 --> 37:09.820
and it will help all those who will come to Me.

37:09.820 --> 37:11.900
It has happened.

37:11.900 --> 37:14.860
So for you, it should not be difficult at all.

37:14.860 --> 37:16.660
All of you should, first of all,

37:16.660 --> 37:18.980
see that you are not a conditioned person

37:18.980 --> 37:21.260
and you do not have an ego

37:21.260 --> 37:24.140
and then you should go ahead with it

37:24.140 --> 37:27.500
and you'll be amazed how things will work out.

37:27.500 --> 37:31.260
Today's puja is very short puja.

37:31.540 --> 37:35.740
That's why I gave you a long lecture.

37:36.100 --> 37:39.380
There are so many things which I cannot,

37:39.380 --> 37:45.140
at this time, which is short, tell you

37:45.140 --> 37:48.100
but if you sit down, you can easily make

37:48.100 --> 37:52.220
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight yourself.

37:52.220 --> 37:55.580
So, now put your mind to it

37:55.580 --> 38:00.100
in a way that you are the organizer.

38:00.100 --> 38:02.860
Then what should you do? What can you do?

38:02.860 --> 38:04.140
What are you going to achieve?

38:04.140 --> 38:08.780
Please try and it will work out.

38:09.460 --> 38:11.260
All of you can do it.

38:11.260 --> 38:14.300
I think best is to make a diary for yourself

38:14.300 --> 38:17.340
and write it down in that: what you have done,

38:17.340 --> 38:19.420
how many people you have given realization,

38:19.420 --> 38:24.060
how many got cured, what do you think about them.

38:24.060 --> 38:26.620
But now, if there's no diary,

38:26.620 --> 38:27.940
Sahaja yogis can say among,

38:27.940 --> 38:31.020
"Mother, we have no diary, so we'll start it tomorrow." No,

38:31.020 --> 38:34.060
you start it today.

38:35.780 --> 38:38.420
Only trouble with Sahaja yogis

38:38.420 --> 38:42.340
is that they take things little lightly.

38:45.380 --> 38:49.740
Of course, that is their character.

38:49.740 --> 38:53.300
But not Sahaja Yoga.

38:53.300 --> 38:55.580
Other things you can take lightly.

38:55.580 --> 38:57.340
If somebody shouts at you,

38:57.340 --> 38:58.820
somebody gets angry with you,

38:58.820 --> 39:01.380
somebody even slaps you, take it lightly.

39:01.380 --> 39:04.340
Doesn't matter, makes no difference to you,

39:04.340 --> 39:06.300
because you are the spirit.

39:06.300 --> 39:07.900
Nothing can destroy the spirit.

39:07.900 --> 39:10.780
Nainam Chidanti Shastrani.

39:12.580 --> 39:15.140
But when it comes to Sahaja Yoga,

39:15.140 --> 39:17.420
your attitude should be different.

39:17.420 --> 39:19.620
If you are relaxing on one side,

39:19.820 --> 39:22.980
another side you have to be dynamic

39:22.980 --> 39:25.860
and that side is where you have to put forward

39:25.860 --> 39:27.420
the theories of Sahaja Yoga,

39:27.420 --> 39:29.180
when you have to talk to people,

39:29.180 --> 39:31.460
you have to organize a press conference

39:31.460 --> 39:33.580
or whatever sort of thing you want to do.

39:33.580 --> 39:35.580
At whatever level you want to work it out,

39:35.580 --> 39:38.020
please make a proper plan about it

39:38.020 --> 39:40.140
and just do it.

39:40.140 --> 39:44.500
It will all work out. I'm sure it will work out.

39:44.820 --> 39:50.180
With all these ideas that I have,

39:51.300 --> 39:54.300
you have many more

39:54.300 --> 39:58.260
and I hope by next year,

39:58.260 --> 40:00.980
we'll see manifestation of those.

40:00.980 --> 40:03.140
I hope many people will write books

40:03.140 --> 40:05.460
like U.C. Rai has written.

40:05.460 --> 40:11.380
I'm sure books can be written by every doctor.

40:11.380 --> 40:14.220
Doctor U.C. Rai has worked single-handed.

40:14.220 --> 40:16.940
Everything he has done single-handed.

40:16.940 --> 40:19.660
So beautifully he has worked it out.

40:19.660 --> 40:25.140
So, everybody can publish a book with their experiences,

40:25.420 --> 40:28.420
with their understanding of Sahaja Yoga,

40:28.220 --> 40:31.380
which will help Sahaja yogis also.

40:31.460 --> 40:36.500
But it should be honest, very honest book.

40:36.500 --> 40:39.900
I'm sure such a book will be very much appreciated

40:39.900 --> 40:44.500
in Sahaja Yoga and we would like to publish such books also.

40:44.500 --> 40:46.700
All those who have such ideas

40:46.700 --> 40:52.300
should make an effort to create some new books,

40:52.300 --> 40:57.540
some new ideas, some new creation.

40:57.540 --> 40:59.580
Is very important

40:59.580 --> 41:01.620
because in these modern times

41:01.620 --> 41:04.900
people want to do something new,

41:04.900 --> 41:07.820
something novel.

41:08.420 --> 41:10.620
Under these circumstances,

41:10.620 --> 41:13.420
I'm sure you all will work out.

41:14.060 --> 41:17.500
So, all the time we have to think about Sahaja Yoga

41:17.500 --> 41:22.620
and jot it down whatever ideas are coming into your mind

41:22.620 --> 41:26.460
and then these can be properly put together,

41:26.460 --> 41:30.420
making a beautiful book of Sahaja Yoga.

41:30.420 --> 41:33.420
Ladies also have lots of chances of doing

41:33.420 --> 41:36.700
so many things for Sahaja Yoga.

41:40.780 --> 41:44.340
This is a very opportune time.

41:44.700 --> 41:53.420
I think Satya Yuga is starting from tomorrow. No doubt.

42:10.660 --> 42:14.460
And what will be the symptom

42:14.460 --> 42:20.380
that now the satya will be victorious, vijaya.

42:29.140 --> 42:31.420
Whatever people may try,

42:31.420 --> 42:34.340
ultimately satya will be vijaya.

42:34.340 --> 42:35.820
Satyame vijayate.

42:35.820 --> 42:40.740
That's going to happen and you are responsible.

42:45.540 --> 42:48.580
For this I congratulate you again and again.

42:48.580 --> 42:52.260
And I hope you will have the commitment to do that.

42:52.260 --> 42:55.820
May God bless you all.
