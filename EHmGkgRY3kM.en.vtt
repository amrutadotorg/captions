00:00.125 --> 00:01.417
Sahasrara Puja Cabella Ligure, Italy
6th May 6, 2001

00:02.208 --> 00:06.542
Today I bow to all the Sahaja yogis

00:06.709 --> 00:09.125
who have found the truth.

00:14.542 --> 00:19.667
There has been from ages

00:20.542 --> 00:23.250
the seeking for the truth.

00:24.083 --> 00:28.250
And when people discovered

00:30.083 --> 00:34.709
that there’s no other way but to surrender

00:35.667 --> 00:40.709
to the Divine that you can find the truth,

00:42.583 --> 00:46.417
they did not know how to do it,  how to work it out.

00:48.458 --> 00:53.250
There have been seekers all over the world.

00:54.083 --> 00:59.375
I went to Turkey and I was amazed  there have been lots of Sufis,

00:59.709 --> 01:03.125
but their disciples were not realized souls,

01:04.125 --> 01:07.709
because the Sufis also did not know how they got their realization.

01:09.250 --> 01:13.375
Such darkness existed around

01:14.250 --> 01:17.125
people who were seeking.

01:17.458 --> 01:20.041
All over the world I find,

01:20.291 --> 01:23.458
when I was a little girl,

01:23.709 --> 01:29.709
that they are completely ignorant about

01:30.542 --> 01:33.166
how to find the truth.

01:34.375 --> 01:40.083
So many were lost in all kinds of so-called

01:40.417 --> 01:43.709
religions and rituals.

01:44.417 --> 01:47.291
All kinds of rituals they used to do;

01:47.583 --> 01:52.000
morning till evening, some sort of a ritual they would do.

01:53.333 --> 01:56.667
Whether they were Hindus, Christians, Muslims,

01:57.333 --> 02:00.333
they all believed that by doing all  these rituals

02:01.041 --> 02:05.000
you’ll achieve something, that you will know the truth,

02:05.458 --> 02:08.125
that you will get your Self-realization.

02:08.625 --> 02:15.083
All such seekers went to wrong people

02:16.417 --> 02:19.375
and to wrong directions,

02:20.041 --> 02:23.458
because they were really seeking from their heart.

02:24.542 --> 02:27.250
So they were very misleading,

02:28.417 --> 02:32.458
misleading and they were misled

02:33.583 --> 02:40.625
into such horrible black areas

02:41.709 --> 02:44.083
that they did not know what they were seeking,

02:44.250 --> 02:47.417
what they are supposed to seek, what they have to have.

02:51.291 --> 02:53.625
It has been prophesized

02:54.500 --> 02:59.291
that when Kali Yuga will come,

03:00.417 --> 03:02.709
people will find themselves.

03:04.208 --> 03:09.083
There’s a story about Nala and Kali,

03:10.583 --> 03:18.583
who had taken away the wife,

03:19.375 --> 03:21.291
Damayanti, of Nala.

03:23.291 --> 03:29.542
So once Nala caught hold of him,

03:31.041 --> 03:33.583
and he said that “Now I’m going to kill you,

03:34.417 --> 03:37.041
because you are a very mischievous man

03:37.417 --> 03:39.500
and you have done such a harm to me.”

03:41.709 --> 03:45.250
So the Kali said,

03:46.166 --> 03:47.291
“You can kill me,

03:47.417 --> 03:50.250
but before that you should know what is my importance,

03:51.041 --> 03:55.417
what is my mahatva. And the my importance is

03:55.542 --> 04:00.041
that when my time will come”

04:00.500 --> 04:03.208
–when Kali Yuga will come –

04:03.709 --> 04:07.625
“then all those people who are seeking the truth

04:08.667 --> 04:15.667
in the jungles, in the hills and dales,

04:16.166 --> 04:23.166
in the Himalayas will become ordinary householders,

04:24.125 --> 04:29.125
they’ll be householders. They won’t be sanyasis going about,

04:29.709 --> 04:34.500
they’ll be householders, and they will find the truth.”

04:35.375 --> 04:38.041
This has been prophesized long time back,

04:38.375 --> 04:42.250
and also there’s a book about it, a book;

04:43.417 --> 04:47.417
as you must have read in the book which says

04:47.625 --> 04:52.375
that the time has come for people  to know themselves.

04:55.041 --> 04:57.417
Every religion has said one thing,

04:57.625 --> 05:00.166
that you must know yourself.

05:01.375 --> 05:05.709
Islam says the same, Buddha says the same,

05:07.208 --> 05:11.250
Christians say the same, Hindus say the same.

05:12.583 --> 05:20.458
So till then they go on doing all kinds of acrobats,

05:22.500 --> 05:27.041
but they realize that “we haven’t found the truth.”

05:30.583 --> 05:34.375
So it came to My lot;

05:36.166 --> 05:39.333
from My childhood I knew I had to do it.

05:39.667 --> 05:42.333
But when I saw the human beings,

05:43.250 --> 05:47.500
how much in darkness they were about themselves,

05:48.583 --> 05:53.542
how aggressive and how sinful they were,

05:54.709 --> 05:59.417
all their style was so cruel

06:00.625 --> 06:02.625
that it was unbelievable.

06:04.208 --> 06:07.417
That was the time also I saw Hitler coming up,

06:08.542 --> 06:15.125
and our country also was in complete bondage.

06:17.625 --> 06:23.500
So the first thing was to make our country free,

06:24.709 --> 06:31.291
was very important. And that’s why I took a very, very active role

06:32.333 --> 06:37.291
in the movement that was for the freedom of our country;

06:38.417 --> 06:41.208
same with My father and mother.

06:42.709 --> 06:50.417
But when we got the freedom somehow, after some time we got lost.

06:52.041 --> 06:56.375
People started taking to all kinds of modern things

06:56.709 --> 07:01.208
which were wrong, which were so-called entertaining.

07:04.083 --> 07:08.458
With all that, I found all over the world

07:09.458 --> 07:13.583
there was a big seeking force,

07:15.041 --> 07:18.125
and some false people took full advantage of it.

07:19.333 --> 07:23.291
They went out, made lots and lots of money,

07:24.166 --> 07:26.667
and with their falsehood they cursed them,

07:27.083 --> 07:28.709
I don’t know what they did to them.

07:29.291 --> 07:31.709
So many seekers were lost like that.

07:33.041 --> 07:37.250
Despite that I went to America, and I was shocked

07:37.667 --> 07:40.041
how the things were going on there.

07:40.583 --> 07:44.625
But I couldn’t help it because they were so

07:45.458 --> 07:49.417
mentally  ill-equipped,

07:49.667 --> 07:54.125
they could not understand what they have to have,

07:54.500 --> 07:57.500
and you can't pay for the truth.

08:00.375 --> 08:06.125
Then it happened that I had started it after

08:06.458 --> 08:12.083
the Sahasrara was broken. And you know the story

08:12.542 --> 08:14.667
how I broke the Sahasrara,

08:16.583 --> 08:23.166
and how from one person I started giving realization.

08:24.166 --> 08:26.709
But from America I got very disappointed.

08:28.083 --> 08:31.375
I was thinking, “How will it grow? How will it work out?”

08:33.291 --> 08:38.583
We had about twenty-five people who were realized souls by then

08:39.375 --> 08:46.250
in India,  but they realized what they have got by realization.

08:47.208 --> 08:51.709
They realized that they have become very good people,

08:53.208 --> 08:55.625
they have given up all bad habits;

08:56.500 --> 09:00.291
and they were wanting to worship Me.

09:01.625 --> 09:04.250
I said, “No, no, don’t worship Me

09:04.667 --> 09:08.667
because people will not understand.”

09:09.333 --> 09:11.458
But they one day forced Me.

09:12.250 --> 09:15.083
So on our terrace of the house they came

09:15.333 --> 09:17.250
and worshipped Me,  because

09:18.000 --> 09:20.542
somebody had told them, “This is the Goddess.”

09:21.625 --> 09:27.583
So what had happened was after the program

09:28.583 --> 09:31.625
one maidservant came up who was possessed.

09:32.417 --> 09:35.500
And she came and she started calling Me

09:36.041 --> 09:38.542
by the name of “Goddess.”

09:39.458 --> 09:42.000
So people said, “What are you saying?”

09:42.417 --> 09:45.208
She was a woman, but talking like a man.

09:46.208 --> 09:48.542
So she said, “I’m telling you the truth.

09:49.166 --> 09:52.333
She is the Goddess who has come to save us.”

09:53.583 --> 09:57.709
Her language was not that of a maidservant

09:58.166 --> 10:04.083
but of a very well-educated brahmin,

10:04.667 --> 10:08.500
who would say all Adi Shankaracharya’s stotras.

10:09.166 --> 10:13.458
It was very surprising. So they asked her several questions

10:14.041 --> 10:15.625
and then she just fainted.

10:16.458 --> 10:19.500
So I told them, “Just don’t listen to her, it’s no use.”

10:20.208 --> 10:21.417
But they would not agree,

10:21.542 --> 10:23.667
and they said, “Mother, we have to worship You.”

10:24.667 --> 10:27.542
So somehow I agreed to that,

10:28.166 --> 10:33.375
and they got hold of seven brahmins to do that.

10:34.333 --> 10:41.041
They were afraid because to do that puja it’s very dangerous

10:41.542 --> 10:45.041
and it could harm you, if it is not the truth.

10:45.709 --> 10:48.291
But on the contrary when they were doing  the puja

10:48.458 --> 10:49.709
they got their realization.

10:50.667 --> 10:53.417
And they just said, “Now, this is the truth.

10:54.333 --> 10:57.000
” They felt the cool breeze in their hand,

10:57.291 --> 11:01.125
all the symptoms told about a realized soul started.

11:03.583 --> 11:08.041
But I didn’t want to say everything at that time,

11:08.583 --> 11:10.208
because

11:11.083 --> 11:14.583
there were many others who were saying, “I am this, I am that,”

11:15.291 --> 11:19.333
so I didn’t want to sort of expose it altogether.

11:19.583 --> 11:22.250
But gradually I found that

11:22.709 --> 11:26.500
people got attracted and they used to come to My program,

11:27.500 --> 11:30.500
and then the Sahaja Yoga started spreading

11:31.542 --> 11:36.375
allover in a very interesting manner.

11:37.625 --> 11:39.625
So this Sahasrara

11:41.250 --> 11:45.333
Day, or we can call the day when the Sahasrara was opened out,

11:46.291 --> 11:48.208
is a very important.

11:49.083 --> 11:54.125
It’s very subtle. We just know about the kundalini,

11:54.709 --> 11:57.375
that she’s coiled up in three-and-a-half

11:57.625 --> 12:01.083
and she’s lying in the triangular bone

12:01.417 --> 12:03.500
known as sacrum.

12:04.542 --> 12:07.500
But we don’t know what she works, how she works,

12:07.709 --> 12:09.625
or what happens to us.

12:11.709 --> 12:15.500
She rises in six centers

12:16.417 --> 12:21.375
and breaks the seventh center, I should say breaks the sixth center

12:22.250 --> 12:26.542
because Ganesha’s center doesn’t play any role

12:26.709 --> 12:33.208
so when she breaks the sixth center which is the Sahasrara,

12:34.417 --> 12:39.667
then she connects you to the all-pervading Power of divine love.

12:43.125 --> 12:50.083
But what is this divine love?

12:51.166 --> 12:53.125
What does this do?

12:54.125 --> 13:01.208
It is the energy of the Mother,

13:02.125 --> 13:06.208
we can say it is the energy of Adi Shakti

13:07.083 --> 13:13.417
which is all over, works through vibrations.

13:14.583 --> 13:16.625
But what are these vibrations?

13:18.542 --> 13:22.500
It’s a very subtle energy that

13:22.709 --> 13:26.041
starts flowing through your Sahasrara.

13:28.125 --> 13:30.625
All the thousand petals of the Sahasrara

13:31.500 --> 13:33.667
get slowly enlightened

13:34.291 --> 13:37.125
and it starts flowing throughout your body,

13:38.458 --> 13:43.667
throughout your hands, feet, throughout your body.

13:45.166 --> 13:48.125
And the more you are,

13:49.709 --> 13:53.125
I mean your attention is on the Sahasrara,

13:53.667 --> 13:55.709
the more it works faster.

13:57.333 --> 13:59.542
Now in the science I’ve read

14:00.208 --> 14:04.333
that they have discovered an energy called, they call it …

14:06.709 --> 14:12.291
I don’t know how it – ask the scientists that!

14:17.417 --> 14:19.333
What energy?

14:20.125 --> 14:22.500
quantum hah,  quantum energy.

14:23.125 --> 14:26.041
Quantum, I don’t know why they call it quantum,

14:26.291 --> 14:29.500
because “quantum” means four.

14:30.291 --> 14:34.542
” So it might be meaning the energy of Ganesha maybe,

14:34.709 --> 14:38.041
I don’t know. Because scientists are blind people,

14:38.208 --> 14:40.041
I don’t know what they call what!

14:40.583 --> 14:43.208
So they are saying there’s a quantum energy.

14:43.709 --> 14:45.709
Now this quantum energy

14:46.166 --> 14:51.041
according to them flows in a very subtle manner,

14:51.291 --> 14:56.667
and it is normally not visible but it has light.

14:57.542 --> 15:02.709
You have seen that in so many of photographs of Mine

15:03.208 --> 15:06.041
there’s light of all kind.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.083
This energy moves in a light,

15:09.667 --> 15:13.583
so this is the quantum energy, I think – again I am not very sure,

15:14.041 --> 15:16.250
because scientists are, I’ve always found them

15:16.417 --> 15:18.041
just a little bit vague.

15:18.333 --> 15:21.166
But this quantum energy they’re talking about

15:21.333 --> 15:24.208
is something like  the spiritual energy

15:24.375 --> 15:26.417
or the energy of love,

15:27.166 --> 15:31.291
which flows around. And this quantum energy,

15:32.709 --> 15:37.667
they do not know what it does but they have seen it has got light.

15:39.375 --> 15:42.000
They call it “quantum” because according to them

15:42.166 --> 15:43.542
it flows in bundles,

15:44.041 --> 15:47.125
and every bundle is a “quanta” according to them.

15:48.417 --> 15:53.709
Now this energy when it flows, as you have seen yourself, it works.

15:54.500 --> 15:58.083
It works in every direction, in every dimension.

15:58.583 --> 16:00.709
For example it works physically.

16:01.542 --> 16:04.542
Supposing you have some physical ailment,

16:05.417 --> 16:08.333
you have seen many people get cured in My presence,

16:08.667 --> 16:12.125
just in My presence – I need not do anything to them.

16:12.500 --> 16:17.250
Or also as soon as I see somebody, I know what he’s suffering from.

16:18.041 --> 16:22.709
That’s also, I must say, My connection with the Divine;

16:24.041 --> 16:27.583
and that tells Me what’s wrong with what person

16:28.125 --> 16:32.208
and what should be done, and it can be cured in no time.

16:33.000 --> 16:36.083
Because that also comes to Me just like that. I mean,

16:36.250 --> 16:39.417
I don’t ask any questions,  I don’t try to find out,

16:39.625 --> 16:43.125
I do not analyze, but it just says, “Do like this”

16:43.500 --> 16:47.709
or it also doesn’t say, it just does.

16:48.208 --> 16:51.166
It just works automatically.

16:51.375 --> 16:55.583
It is very difficult to explain how this energy works.

16:56.250 --> 16:58.667
But all of you who have got realization

16:59.375 --> 17:02.166
can also work out your own energies.

17:02.375 --> 17:08.291
How? By releasing it, by feeling it,

17:09.500 --> 17:15.709
by giving it to others, by experimenting.

17:16.583 --> 17:21.667
Of course, Sahaja Yoga has spread because of you only.

17:22.375 --> 17:25.417
You are the people who have brought people to Sahaja Yoga.

17:26.083 --> 17:30.667
But that’s not the end of it. We have to save this world.

17:31.166 --> 17:35.041
For that at least I feel forty percent

17:35.250 --> 17:37.166
of people should get their realization.

17:37.625 --> 17:40.208
Whatever may be their nationality,

17:40.458 --> 17:43.542
whatever may be their education, anything,

17:44.542 --> 17:52.417
they are to be given Self-realization. In our Indian

17:53.625 --> 17:59.125
scriptures it’s clearly written, “Without Atmasakshatkar

17:59.291 --> 18:03.291
your life is useless.” But what is Atmasakshatkar,

18:03.458 --> 18:07.625
is the knowledge about yourself. How can you have that knowledge

18:08.041 --> 18:13.000
unless and until you become one with this all-pervading Power?

18:13.709 --> 18:18.542
So it was a very great thing, I felt, that this Sahasrara

18:18.709 --> 18:23.125
I could open in 1970.

18:24.417 --> 18:28.208
I realized I was overwhelmed

18:28.500 --> 18:32.125
because I knew this is the only trouble,

18:32.333 --> 18:35.333
it is the only obstacle human beings are having:

18:35.667 --> 18:40.208
because their Sahasraras are not open, that’s why they are

18:40.625 --> 18:45.500
going in the darkness, that’s why they are having wars,

18:46.083 --> 18:49.500
that’s why they are having all kinds of problems.

18:49.709 --> 18:52.375
But if their Sahasrara opens

18:52.709 --> 18:55.417
and if they become one with the divine Power,

18:56.458 --> 18:59.041
all their problems would be solved,

18:59.500 --> 19:02.166
every type of problem will be solved

19:02.458 --> 19:04.333
and they’ll be very happy people.

19:05.083 --> 19:08.709
I realized it and I was very happy, I was over-joyous.

19:09.417 --> 19:12.458
But nobody understood Me.

19:13.041 --> 19:17.125
I don’t know, they thought I must be talking something nonsensical.

19:17.458 --> 19:19.667
Nobody understood it what it is,

19:20.208 --> 19:24.375
because even in the shastras it’s not written

19:26.709 --> 19:29.375
about kundalini so clearly.

19:29.709 --> 19:33.542
Only one great saint called Gyaneshwara

19:34.208 --> 19:38.417
wrote it in his book in the sixth chapter, about the kundalini.

19:39.083 --> 19:43.083
It’s not so clear, only he said that with the kundalini

19:43.291 --> 19:45.625
you can get your awakening.

19:46.083 --> 19:48.667
Also you sing that song always I’ve heard,

19:49.166 --> 19:53.375
which says that “Oh Kundalini Mother, please be awakened!”

19:54.083 --> 19:58.166
But nobody knows that what this kundalini is

19:58.333 --> 20:00.709
and why are you singing that song.

20:01.417 --> 20:05.083
It was all in our country people used to sing in the village

20:06.041 --> 20:10.667
so clearly, but nobody understood the meaning of it.

20:11.208 --> 20:15.417
Just they used to sing as a, some sort of a bhajan or could be

20:15.583 --> 20:18.333
some sort of a music concert.

20:18.542 --> 20:21.375
But nobody knew what it was talking about.

20:22.041 --> 20:24.333
It was such a misunderstanding about everything.

20:25.166 --> 20:29.583
And all these poets also who have written

20:30.208 --> 20:35.417
clearly about awakening, about realization,

20:36.041 --> 20:39.125
everything was just in the books.

20:39.500 --> 20:43.000
They would read one line of the book, then stop there.

20:43.250 --> 20:45.458
Another person would start the another line,

20:45.667 --> 20:48.083
then he stops at another line, point;

20:48.250 --> 20:50.166
like that they were just reading.

20:50.417 --> 20:54.125
Same thing about all the scriptures.

20:54.583 --> 20:58.375
There was big misunderstanding created

20:59.125 --> 21:04.208
and was used for the purpose of their own self-interest.

21:05.166 --> 21:08.375
That is how we couldn’t get people

21:08.542 --> 21:11.208
who understood what was Self-realization.

21:12.166 --> 21:14.041
It was just for some money

21:14.291 --> 21:18.375
or for some certain type of a position to get,

21:18.667 --> 21:25.375
people started big, big organizations,

21:26.125 --> 21:30.625
very big religious organizations

21:31.125 --> 21:32.542
I don’t know what to call them –

21:33.041 --> 21:35.583
but none of them were realized souls.

21:36.625 --> 21:40.709
For example, there was a great saint called Viditama

21:41.542 --> 21:48.458
who went to China, and he started a religion called Zen.

21:49.375 --> 21:51.375
Zen means dhyana.

21:51.667 --> 21:56.500
And he wanted to put Zen

21:57.041 --> 22:01.000
in such a manner  that people become thoughtless

22:02.125 --> 22:05.333
He made a big tank

22:06.375 --> 22:11.083
full of sand with patterns and put some stones,

22:11.625 --> 22:17.208
and he had said that “You sit on the edge of this pond

22:17.709 --> 22:22.333
and just see, but don’t think.”

22:22.709 --> 22:24.709
People didn’t understand what it was.

22:25.125 --> 22:27.458
Normally anybody would go there and say,

22:27.542 --> 22:32.583
“Oh, this looks like some ships in the sea,” or all kinds of things.

22:33.166 --> 22:35.583
But nobody tried for thoughtless awareness.

22:37.417 --> 22:41.333
And I told some of them that this is for thoughtless awareness,

22:41.583 --> 22:44.083
but they couldn’t understand.

22:45.333 --> 22:49.583
Then we have also in Japan, Tao.

22:51.291 --> 22:54.709
He talked about the all-pervading Power which was Tao,

22:55.667 --> 22:58.709
and Lao-Tze was the one who did.

22:59.333 --> 23:03.375
He had described saints: how the saints are,

23:03.542 --> 23:06.709
how they behave, how they talk,

23:07.458 --> 23:11.166
what is their mannerism, everything.

23:11.500 --> 23:14.667
But how you become a saint, nobody said.

23:15.375 --> 23:19.208
I think throughout there has been no description

23:19.458 --> 23:25.041
how to make a person into a saintly personality.

23:46.542 --> 23:49.333
So also in the twelfth century

23:52.166 --> 23:55.417
Gyaneshwara was in the twelfth century

23:56.041 --> 23:59.667
he talked about it and he said about it in his book, everything.

24:00.542 --> 24:03.375
Because it was a kind of a

24:03.709 --> 24:07.709
style that a guru should have only one disciple,

24:08.542 --> 24:12.583
who should give to one disciple realization, not to many.

24:13.083 --> 24:17.166
I don’t know why, what made them such a law or a rule.

24:17.709 --> 24:22.166
And then it started in the twelfth century, there were many saints

24:24.458 --> 24:29.000
who sang the praise of realization.

24:30.291 --> 24:33.500
And all of them thought that these rituals are no good,

24:33.709 --> 24:36.458
so they discarded rituals and this.

24:37.083 --> 24:40.583
But what was the thing that had to happen, nobody knew.

24:42.041 --> 24:45.542
I have read all their lives,

24:46.083 --> 24:50.083
I’ve read afterwards also many saints who were there,

24:51.458 --> 24:56.166
but it seems nobody knew how to raise the kundalini.

24:57.208 --> 24:59.250
This was the basic problem,

24:59.417 --> 25:01.709
they didn’t know how to raise the kundalini;

25:02.667 --> 25:05.458
while I think they didn’t have that power,

25:06.166 --> 25:08.417
or maybe they had no knowledge.

25:08.583 --> 25:11.125
They talked about kundalini, all right,

25:11.417 --> 25:14.709
but they did not know how to raise the kundalini.

25:16.458 --> 25:21.000
This is a very special power of spirituality.

25:21.667 --> 25:24.250
None of them have been able

25:24.375 --> 25:27.542
to say or tell you how to raise the kundalini.

25:28.166 --> 25:31.000
Now you all have got this power,

25:31.333 --> 25:33.333
which is such a rare thing.

25:33.542 --> 25:35.458
All of you have got it,

25:35.625 --> 25:39.125
I don’t see anybody who doesn’t have that power

25:39.458 --> 25:42.291
to raise the kundalini. You may not;

25:42.542 --> 25:45.166
you may be contented with yourself,

25:45.250 --> 25:47.333
but that’s not a very good thing.

25:47.625 --> 25:52.166
If you have got your Sahasrara opened out

25:52.375 --> 25:55.291
and if you know how to raise the kundalini,

25:55.500 --> 25:58.500
you must go all out to give realization to people.

26:00.417 --> 26:05.375
Nothing is going to benefit people more than Self-realization.

26:06.208 --> 26:10.166
No use doing other charities, giving money, giving this

26:10.417 --> 26:14.667
is of no use. Best thing is to go all out

26:15.208 --> 26:17.667
to see people who want their realization,

26:18.250 --> 26:20.250
and to give them realization.

26:20.375 --> 26:22.291
I was very happy to see

26:22.583 --> 26:26.709
that they have started working it out on the gypsies.

26:27.375 --> 26:29.542
I’ve a special feeling for gypsies.

26:30.166 --> 26:34.125
For no fault of theirs, they are leading a very miserable life.

26:34.500 --> 26:37.709
And how the gypsies got the realization!

26:38.667 --> 26:43.250
You can see that you can give it to anyone

26:44.125 --> 26:48.417
who wants to have it. One thing is there you cannot force on anyone.

26:49.542 --> 26:52.333
If they have a desire,

26:52.542 --> 26:55.125
they can get Self-realization.

26:55.333 --> 26:59.375
So this day, I have to just say now so many years have passed,

26:59.667 --> 27:03.166
I have worked quite hard, day and night,

27:04.083 --> 27:06.542
and My only desire was

27:07.125 --> 27:12.083
that you people should take  it seriously and work it out.

27:12.250 --> 27:14.542
Don’t keep your realization to yourself.

27:15.083 --> 27:18.250
As many as people you can give realization,

27:18.583 --> 27:22.417
the greatest obligation will be on Me

27:23.166 --> 27:27.125
and on God Almighty. Only thing is you should try

27:27.375 --> 27:29.625
to give realizations to others.

27:30.125 --> 27:32.375
You will never make a mistake,

27:32.542 --> 27:35.667
you can never make a mistake because the kundalini knows.

27:36.208 --> 27:39.291
She knows you, she knows you are realized soul.

27:39.458 --> 27:41.000
She’llrespect you.

27:41.291 --> 27:44.333
Even if you make mistakes she’ll correct it

27:44.542 --> 27:47.625
and she’ll help you, in every way.

27:49.125 --> 27:52.291
I’m just a, I should say a housewife

27:54.083 --> 27:58.417
who had no support from anyone.

27:59.500 --> 28:03.375
But I was sure that it’s My job to find out

28:04.208 --> 28:06.166
how to break the Sahasrara.

28:07.125 --> 28:10.083
Whatever way it is – outside doesn’t matter –

28:10.458 --> 28:16.375
My job it was to find out the breaking of Sahasrara, which I did.

28:16.709 --> 28:21.041
Now you also know that, so this is your job.

28:21.291 --> 28:23.208
And the scientists now will be coming around

28:23.375 --> 28:25.041
you to ask you questions,

28:25.291 --> 28:28.417
because they don’t know what they are talking about is

28:28.667 --> 28:30.709
what we are already doing.

28:31.333 --> 28:36.291
So you are so powerful, all of you. But how many of you are really

28:36.709 --> 28:38.709
doing this work, is the point.

28:39.542 --> 28:42.542
Today is a very important day. I want to tell you

28:43.417 --> 28:47.667
that you have to strengthen My hands.

28:49.375 --> 28:52.041
They say the Goddess has one thousand hands,

28:52.542 --> 28:56.458
but even the one thousand hands are now asking

28:56.583 --> 29:00.375
that you come along with your two hands and work it out.

29:01.041 --> 29:03.166
It’s very important what you have to do.

29:04.125 --> 29:09.625
All kinds of problems in this world, they come because of ignorance

29:10.542 --> 29:13.500
take it politics, take it any, any problem.

29:14.208 --> 29:16.291
And how it is solved is also,

29:17.250 --> 29:21.667
is your power with the Divine.

29:22.458 --> 29:25.041
I’ll give you one simple example.

29:25.375 --> 29:28.375
That day the Turkish people came

29:29.333 --> 29:31.208
and were begging of Me, “Mother,

29:31.375 --> 29:33.208
You must come. You should not postpone,”

29:33.417 --> 29:36.500
and this passport, My passport was a problem.  I said,

29:37.250 --> 29:39.625
“The passport is not ready, how will I come?”

29:40.375 --> 29:43.583
But then I thought, “Why not? We’ll have the passport also done.”

29:44.166 --> 29:45.709
So passport was ready.

29:46.542 --> 29:49.542
And they wanted Me to go to Turkey because they said,

29:49.709 --> 29:51.583
“The financial condition has gone down very much,

29:51.709 --> 29:54.625
the economy has gone down absolutely, we are ruined.”

29:55.709 --> 29:59.041
I went there, I didn’t do anything about it;

29:59.625 --> 30:03.333
within two days they announced

30:03.667 --> 30:06.709
ten billion dollar help from the World Bank.

30:07.583 --> 30:11.458
Now I didn’t talk to World Bank, I had nothing to do with them,

30:11.625 --> 30:13.583
I don’t know.

30:14.125 --> 30:17.458
Then I said, “No, maybe you see, they are helping because

30:17.667 --> 30:19.417
you people are in such trouble.

30:19.542 --> 30:21.333
” They said, “But so many countries are,

30:21.542 --> 30:23.625
why have they helped us only?”

30:24.583 --> 30:26.250
I said, “That’s the point!”

30:26.583 --> 30:29.458
So now I was surprised, in Turkey

30:29.625 --> 30:33.208
there are only ladies mostly who are leaders, mostly,

30:34.000 --> 30:36.250
and they have done such a big job.

30:36.417 --> 30:40.542
Now I want to see what you people are doing in your country.

30:41.291 --> 30:45.208
You may say that “In my country the people are hopelessly bad.”

30:45.417 --> 30:47.542
Maybe, I don’t say no.

30:48.000 --> 30:51.667
But still there are places, there are pockets

30:52.375 --> 30:55.500
where you can go and talk to them, tell them,

30:55.667 --> 30:58.291
specially the media you must handle.

30:59.417 --> 31:05.417
It is something you have to do, and find out why you can’t do it.

31:06.250 --> 31:10.208
Like Me: I was not supported by anybody,

31:10.375 --> 31:11.709
not helped by anybody,

31:12.208 --> 31:15.583
and how I have managed to break the Sahasrara –

31:16.125 --> 31:18.583
you can also break the Sahasraras of others.

31:19.542 --> 31:22.709
It’s not difficult, because My vision is

31:23.417 --> 31:25.583
that this world

31:26.125 --> 31:29.709
at least should have forty percent people who are realized souls

31:31.041 --> 31:34.625
and who are practicing Sahaja Yoga,

31:35.458 --> 31:38.500
who are giving realization to people

31:39.250 --> 31:42.125
and trying to change the people.

31:43.166 --> 31:46.041
Anybody who can go and tell, anybody.

31:46.458 --> 31:48.667
There’s no need to discriminate

31:49.083 --> 31:51.166
or to find out, or sit down with their

31:51.417 --> 31:54.417
I mean people take sometimes the

31:54.709 --> 32:00.208
copy of their education and this; that's not needed.

32:01.375 --> 32:03.583
Whosoever it is.

32:04.083 --> 32:07.500
I’m not saying give it to dogs or to animals,

32:08.083 --> 32:12.709
but to human beings. They may be anything;

32:13.333 --> 32:17.208
they may be English or they could be Germans,

32:17.500 --> 32:24.041
they could be Italians anywhere.

32:24.667 --> 32:26.583
I am told also some people

32:26.709 --> 32:29.500
are doing lots of seminars and working very hard

32:30.250 --> 32:33.125
on all levels, and it is working out.

32:33.500 --> 32:36.333
Among Muslims also we have started working,

32:36.583 --> 32:39.166
and even in India it has worked.

32:39.709 --> 32:42.625
You don’t know, people have not lost all their heads,

32:43.125 --> 32:44.625
so it can work out.

32:45.125 --> 32:48.667
Don’t be very much disappointed and upset about it;

32:49.542 --> 32:53.291
gradually it will improve. I think the greatest enemy

32:53.583 --> 32:58.250
of our Self-realization is the drinking.

32:59.333 --> 33:03.083
Drinking, if people take to drinking they become such slaves,

33:03.542 --> 33:06.417
they don’t – their brains are not all right.

33:07.291 --> 33:11.625
So I think the Sahasrara also must be spoilt with drinking.

33:12.250 --> 33:14.667
So drinking I think is the worst enemy.

33:15.583 --> 33:18.250
And if you could find anybody drinking,

33:18.458 --> 33:21.375
if you could help that man to give up drinking itself,

33:21.625 --> 33:25.667
it will work out.  Of course we have other enemies also,

33:26.208 --> 33:30.542
like false gurus are there. Also we have other enemies

33:31.041 --> 33:37.625
who are having some sort of religious manipulations,

33:38.166 --> 33:40.041
but that’s not so important.

33:40.625 --> 33:43.458
If you can get hold of people who are drinking,

33:44.458 --> 33:49.125
I tell you it will change. And they will now understand

33:49.500 --> 33:52.250
that what they have been doing so far, drinking,

33:52.458 --> 33:55.166
running away – now they’ll come

33:55.333 --> 33:58.041
to the fields and they’ll work out Sahaja Yoga.

33:58.625 --> 34:03.333
So you are like very gentle soldiers of love,

34:04.500 --> 34:06.500
and that’s what you have to spread

34:07.250 --> 34:11.208
and talk to others, give them that joy that you have.

34:11.667 --> 34:16.625
Not be satisfied if you have got it only, or few of you have it.

34:17.333 --> 34:20.166
You have to spread it very fast, and you can do it.

34:20.417 --> 34:24.417
Because it doesn’t require money, it doesn’t require any show;

34:24.709 --> 34:28.166
it is just inside, it works, it’s already there.

34:28.500 --> 34:32.041
It’s present there, everybody has it. I knew all that,

34:32.375 --> 34:35.458
of course I knew it; but now you also know it.

34:35.667 --> 34:39.250
So you should work it out, and work it out in the manner

34:39.583 --> 34:44.709
that I am sure one day this world will be a changed place.

34:45.542 --> 34:47.417
Thank you very much.
