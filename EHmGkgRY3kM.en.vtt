00:00:00.125 --> 00:00:01.417
Sahasrara Puja Cabella Ligure, Italy
6th May 6, 2001

00:00:02.208 --> 00:00:06.542
Today I bow to all the Sahaja yogis

00:00:06.709 --> 00:00:09.125
who have found the truth.

00:00:14.542 --> 00:00:19.667
There has been from ages

00:00:20.542 --> 00:00:23.250
the seeking for the truth.

00:00:24.083 --> 00:00:28.250
And when people discovered

00:00:30.083 --> 00:00:34.709
that there’s no other way but to surrender

00:00:35.667 --> 00:00:40.709
to the Divine that you can find the truth,

00:00:42.583 --> 00:00:46.417
they did not know how to do it,  how to work it out.

00:00:48.458 --> 00:00:53.250
There have been seekers all over the world.

00:00:54.083 --> 00:00:59.375
I went to Turkey and I was amazed  there have been lots of Sufis,

00:00:59.709 --> 00:01:03.125
but their disciples were not realized souls,

00:01:04.125 --> 00:01:07.709
because the Sufis also did not know how they got their realization.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.375
Such darkness existed around

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.125
people who were seeking.

00:01:17.458 --> 00:01:20.041
All over the world I find,

00:01:20.291 --> 00:01:23.458
when I was a little girl,

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:29.709
that they are completely ignorant about

00:01:30.542 --> 00:01:33.166
how to find the truth.

00:01:34.375 --> 00:01:40.083
So many were lost in all kinds of so-called

00:01:40.417 --> 00:01:43.709
religions and rituals.

00:01:44.417 --> 00:01:47.291
All kinds of rituals they used to do;

00:01:47.583 --> 00:01:52.000
morning till evening, some sort of a ritual they would do.

00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:56.667
Whether they were Hindus, Christians, Muslims,

00:01:57.333 --> 00:02:00.333
they all believed that by doing all  these rituals

00:02:01.041 --> 00:02:05.000
you’ll achieve something, that you will know the truth,

00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:08.125
that you will get your Self-realization.

00:02:08.625 --> 00:02:15.083
All such seekers went to wrong people

00:02:16.417 --> 00:02:19.375
and to wrong directions,

00:02:20.041 --> 00:02:23.458
because they were really seeking from their heart.

00:02:24.542 --> 00:02:27.250
So they were very misleading,

00:02:28.417 --> 00:02:32.458
misleading and they were misled

00:02:33.583 --> 00:02:40.625
into such horrible black areas

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.083
that they did not know what they were seeking,

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.417
what they are supposed to seek, what they have to have.

00:02:51.291 --> 00:02:53.625
It has been prophesized

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.291
that when Kali Yuga will come,

00:03:00.417 --> 00:03:02.709
people will find themselves.

00:03:04.208 --> 00:03:09.083
There’s a story about Nala and Kali,

00:03:10.583 --> 00:03:18.583
who had taken away the wife,

00:03:19.375 --> 00:03:21.291
Damayanti, of Nala.

00:03:23.291 --> 00:03:29.542
So once Nala caught hold of him,

00:03:31.041 --> 00:03:33.583
and he said that “Now I’m going to kill you,

00:03:34.417 --> 00:03:37.041
because you are a very mischievous man

00:03:37.417 --> 00:03:39.500
and you have done such a harm to me.”

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.250
So the Kali said,

00:03:46.166 --> 00:03:47.291
“You can kill me,

00:03:47.417 --> 00:03:50.250
but before that you should know what is my importance,

00:03:51.041 --> 00:03:55.417
what is my mahatva. And the my importance is

00:03:55.542 --> 00:04:00.041
that when my time will come”

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.208
–when Kali Yuga will come –

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:07.625
“then all those people who are seeking the truth

00:04:08.667 --> 00:04:15.667
in the jungles, in the hills and dales,

00:04:16.166 --> 00:04:23.166
in the Himalayas will become ordinary householders,

00:04:24.125 --> 00:04:29.125
they’ll be householders. They won’t be sanyasis going about,

00:04:29.709 --> 00:04:34.500
they’ll be householders, and they will find the truth.”

00:04:35.375 --> 00:04:38.041
This has been prophesized long time back,

00:04:38.375 --> 00:04:42.250
and also there’s a book about it, a book;

00:04:43.417 --> 00:04:47.417
as you must have read in the book which says

00:04:47.625 --> 00:04:52.375
that the time has come for people  to know themselves.

00:04:55.041 --> 00:04:57.417
Every religion has said one thing,

00:04:57.625 --> 00:05:00.166
that you must know yourself.

00:05:01.375 --> 00:05:05.709
Islam says the same, Buddha says the same,

00:05:07.208 --> 00:05:11.250
Christians say the same, Hindus say the same.

00:05:12.583 --> 00:05:20.458
So till then they go on doing all kinds of acrobats,

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.041
but they realize that “we haven’t found the truth.”

00:05:30.583 --> 00:05:34.375
So it came to My lot;

00:05:36.166 --> 00:05:39.333
from My childhood I knew I had to do it.

00:05:39.667 --> 00:05:42.333
But when I saw the human beings,

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:47.500
how much in darkness they were about themselves,

00:05:48.583 --> 00:05:53.542
how aggressive and how sinful they were,

00:05:54.709 --> 00:05:59.417
all their style was so cruel

00:06:00.625 --> 00:06:02.625
that it was unbelievable.

00:06:04.208 --> 00:06:07.417
That was the time also I saw Hitler coming up,

00:06:08.542 --> 00:06:15.125
and our country also was in complete bondage.

00:06:17.625 --> 00:06:23.500
So the first thing was to make our country free,

00:06:24.709 --> 00:06:31.291
was very important. And that’s why I took a very, very active role

00:06:32.333 --> 00:06:37.291
in the movement that was for the freedom of our country;

00:06:38.417 --> 00:06:41.208
same with My father and mother.

00:06:42.709 --> 00:06:50.417
But when we got the freedom somehow, after some time we got lost.

00:06:52.041 --> 00:06:56.375
People started taking to all kinds of modern things

00:06:56.709 --> 00:07:01.208
which were wrong, which were so-called entertaining.

00:07:04.083 --> 00:07:08.458
With all that, I found all over the world

00:07:09.458 --> 00:07:13.583
there was a big seeking force,

00:07:15.041 --> 00:07:18.125
and some false people took full advantage of it.

00:07:19.333 --> 00:07:23.291
They went out, made lots and lots of money,

00:07:24.166 --> 00:07:26.667
and with their falsehood they cursed them,

00:07:27.083 --> 00:07:28.709
I don’t know what they did to them.

00:07:29.291 --> 00:07:31.709
So many seekers were lost like that.

00:07:33.041 --> 00:07:37.250
Despite that I went to America, and I was shocked

00:07:37.667 --> 00:07:40.041
how the things were going on there.

00:07:40.583 --> 00:07:44.625
But I couldn’t help it because they were so

00:07:45.458 --> 00:07:49.417
mentally  ill-equipped,

00:07:49.667 --> 00:07:54.125
they could not understand what they have to have,

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:57.500
and you can't pay for the truth.

00:08:00.375 --> 00:08:06.125
Then it happened that I had started it after

00:08:06.458 --> 00:08:12.083
the Sahasrara was broken. And you know the story

00:08:12.542 --> 00:08:14.667
how I broke the Sahasrara,

00:08:16.583 --> 00:08:23.166
and how from one person I started giving realization.

00:08:24.166 --> 00:08:26.709
But from America I got very disappointed.

00:08:28.083 --> 00:08:31.375
I was thinking, “How will it grow? How will it work out?”

00:08:33.291 --> 00:08:38.583
We had about twenty-five people who were realized souls by then

00:08:39.375 --> 00:08:46.250
in India,  but they realized what they have got by realization.

00:08:47.208 --> 00:08:51.709
They realized that they have become very good people,

00:08:53.208 --> 00:08:55.625
they have given up all bad habits;

00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:00.291
and they were wanting to worship Me.

00:09:01.625 --> 00:09:04.250
I said, “No, no, don’t worship Me

00:09:04.667 --> 00:09:08.667
because people will not understand.”

00:09:09.333 --> 00:09:11.458
But they one day forced Me.

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:15.083
So on our terrace of the house they came

00:09:15.333 --> 00:09:17.250
and worshipped Me,  because

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.542
somebody had told them, “This is the Goddess.”

00:09:21.625 --> 00:09:27.583
So what had happened was after the program

00:09:28.583 --> 00:09:31.625
one maidservant came up who was possessed.

00:09:32.417 --> 00:09:35.500
And she came and she started calling Me

00:09:36.041 --> 00:09:38.542
by the name of “Goddess.”

00:09:39.458 --> 00:09:42.000
So people said, “What are you saying?”

00:09:42.417 --> 00:09:45.208
She was a woman, but talking like a man.

00:09:46.208 --> 00:09:48.542
So she said, “I’m telling you the truth.

00:09:49.166 --> 00:09:52.333
She is the Goddess who has come to save us.”

00:09:53.583 --> 00:09:57.709
Her language was not that of a maidservant

00:09:58.166 --> 00:10:04.083
but of a very well-educated brahmin,

00:10:04.667 --> 00:10:08.500
who would say all Adi Shankaracharya’s stotras.

00:10:09.166 --> 00:10:13.458
It was very surprising. So they asked her several questions

00:10:14.041 --> 00:10:15.625
and then she just fainted.

00:10:16.458 --> 00:10:19.500
So I told them, “Just don’t listen to her, it’s no use.”

00:10:20.208 --> 00:10:21.417
But they would not agree,

00:10:21.542 --> 00:10:23.667
and they said, “Mother, we have to worship You.”

00:10:24.667 --> 00:10:27.542
So somehow I agreed to that,

00:10:28.166 --> 00:10:33.375
and they got hold of seven brahmins to do that.

00:10:34.333 --> 00:10:41.041
They were afraid because to do that puja it’s very dangerous

00:10:41.542 --> 00:10:45.041
and it could harm you, if it is not the truth.

00:10:45.709 --> 00:10:48.291
But on the contrary when they were doing  the puja

00:10:48.458 --> 00:10:49.709
they got their realization.

00:10:50.667 --> 00:10:53.417
And they just said, “Now, this is the truth.

00:10:54.333 --> 00:10:57.000
” They felt the cool breeze in their hand,

00:10:57.291 --> 00:11:01.125
all the symptoms told about a realized soul started.

00:11:03.583 --> 00:11:08.041
But I didn’t want to say everything at that time,

00:11:08.583 --> 00:11:10.208
because

00:11:11.083 --> 00:11:14.583
there were many others who were saying, “I am this, I am that,”

00:11:15.291 --> 00:11:19.333
so I didn’t want to sort of expose it altogether.

00:11:19.583 --> 00:11:22.250
But gradually I found that

00:11:22.709 --> 00:11:26.500
people got attracted and they used to come to My program,

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:30.500
and then the Sahaja Yoga started spreading

00:11:31.542 --> 00:11:36.375
allover in a very interesting manner.

00:11:37.625 --> 00:11:39.625
So this Sahasrara

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:45.333
Day, or we can call the day when the Sahasrara was opened out,

00:11:46.291 --> 00:11:48.208
is a very important.

00:11:49.083 --> 00:11:54.125
It’s very subtle. We just know about the kundalini,

00:11:54.709 --> 00:11:57.375
that she’s coiled up in three-and-a-half

00:11:57.625 --> 00:12:01.083
and she’s lying in the triangular bone

00:12:01.417 --> 00:12:03.500
known as sacrum.

00:12:04.542 --> 00:12:07.500
But we don’t know what she works, how she works,

00:12:07.709 --> 00:12:09.625
or what happens to us.

00:12:11.709 --> 00:12:15.500
She rises in six centers

00:12:16.417 --> 00:12:21.375
and breaks the seventh center, I should say breaks the sixth center

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:26.542
because Ganesha’s center doesn’t play any role

00:12:26.709 --> 00:12:33.208
so when she breaks the sixth center which is the Sahasrara,

00:12:34.417 --> 00:12:39.667
then she connects you to the all-pervading Power of divine love.

00:12:43.125 --> 00:12:50.083
But what is this divine love?

00:12:51.166 --> 00:12:53.125
What does this do?

00:12:54.125 --> 00:13:01.208
It is the energy of the Mother,

00:13:02.125 --> 00:13:06.208
we can say it is the energy of Adi Shakti

00:13:07.083 --> 00:13:13.417
which is all over, works through vibrations.

00:13:14.583 --> 00:13:16.625
But what are these vibrations?

00:13:18.542 --> 00:13:22.500
It’s a very subtle energy that

00:13:22.709 --> 00:13:26.041
starts flowing through your Sahasrara.

00:13:28.125 --> 00:13:30.625
All the thousand petals of the Sahasrara

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:33.667
get slowly enlightened

00:13:34.291 --> 00:13:37.125
and it starts flowing throughout your body,

00:13:38.458 --> 00:13:43.667
throughout your hands, feet, throughout your body.

00:13:45.166 --> 00:13:48.125
And the more you are,

00:13:49.709 --> 00:13:53.125
I mean your attention is on the Sahasrara,

00:13:53.667 --> 00:13:55.709
the more it works faster.

00:13:57.333 --> 00:13:59.542
Now in the science I’ve read

00:14:00.208 --> 00:14:04.333
that they have discovered an energy called, they call it …

00:14:06.709 --> 00:14:12.291
I don’t know how it – ask the scientists that!

00:14:17.417 --> 00:14:19.333
What energy?

00:14:20.125 --> 00:14:22.500
quantum hah,  quantum energy.

00:14:23.125 --> 00:14:26.041
Quantum, I don’t know why they call it quantum,

00:14:26.291 --> 00:14:29.500
because “quantum” means four.

00:14:30.291 --> 00:14:34.542
” So it might be meaning the energy of Ganesha maybe,

00:14:34.709 --> 00:14:38.041
I don’t know. Because scientists are blind people,

00:14:38.208 --> 00:14:40.041
I don’t know what they call what!

00:14:40.583 --> 00:14:43.208
So they are saying there’s a quantum energy.

00:14:43.709 --> 00:14:45.709
Now this quantum energy

00:14:46.166 --> 00:14:51.041
according to them flows in a very subtle manner,

00:14:51.291 --> 00:14:56.667
and it is normally not visible but it has light.

00:14:57.542 --> 00:15:02.709
You have seen that in so many of photographs of Mine

00:15:03.208 --> 00:15:06.041
there’s light of all kind.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.083
This energy moves in a light,

00:15:09.667 --> 00:15:13.583
so this is the quantum energy, I think – again I am not very sure,

00:15:14.041 --> 00:15:16.250
because scientists are, I’ve always found them

00:15:16.417 --> 00:15:18.041
just a little bit vague.

00:15:18.333 --> 00:15:21.166
But this quantum energy they’re talking about

00:15:21.333 --> 00:15:24.208
is something like  the spiritual energy

00:15:24.375 --> 00:15:26.417
or the energy of love,

00:15:27.166 --> 00:15:31.291
which flows around. And this quantum energy,

00:15:32.709 --> 00:15:37.667
they do not know what it does but they have seen it has got light.

00:15:39.375 --> 00:15:42.000
They call it “quantum” because according to them

00:15:42.166 --> 00:15:43.542
it flows in bundles,

00:15:44.041 --> 00:15:47.125
and every bundle is a “quanta” according to them.

00:15:48.417 --> 00:15:53.709
Now this energy when it flows, as you have seen yourself, it works.

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:58.083
It works in every direction, in every dimension.

00:15:58.583 --> 00:16:00.709
For example it works physically.

00:16:01.542 --> 00:16:04.542
Supposing you have some physical ailment,

00:16:05.417 --> 00:16:08.333
you have seen many people get cured in My presence,

00:16:08.667 --> 00:16:12.125
just in My presence – I need not do anything to them.

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:17.250
Or also as soon as I see somebody, I know what he’s suffering from.

00:16:18.041 --> 00:16:22.709
That’s also, I must say, My connection with the Divine;

00:16:24.041 --> 00:16:27.583
and that tells Me what’s wrong with what person

00:16:28.125 --> 00:16:32.208
and what should be done, and it can be cured in no time.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.083
Because that also comes to Me just like that. I mean,

00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:39.417
I don’t ask any questions,  I don’t try to find out,

00:16:39.625 --> 00:16:43.125
I do not analyze, but it just says, “Do like this”

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:47.709
or it also doesn’t say, it just does.

00:16:48.208 --> 00:16:51.166
It just works automatically.

00:16:51.375 --> 00:16:55.583
It is very difficult to explain how this energy works.

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:58.667
But all of you who have got realization

00:16:59.375 --> 00:17:02.166
can also work out your own energies.

00:17:02.375 --> 00:17:08.291
How? By releasing it, by feeling it,

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:15.709
by giving it to others, by experimenting.

00:17:16.583 --> 00:17:21.667
Of course, Sahaja Yoga has spread because of you only.

00:17:22.375 --> 00:17:25.417
You are the people who have brought people to Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:26.083 --> 00:17:30.667
But that’s not the end of it. We have to save this world.

00:17:31.166 --> 00:17:35.041
For that at least I feel forty percent

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:37.166
of people should get their realization.

00:17:37.625 --> 00:17:40.208
Whatever may be their nationality,

00:17:40.458 --> 00:17:43.542
whatever may be their education, anything,

00:17:44.542 --> 00:17:52.417
they are to be given Self-realization. In our Indian

00:17:53.625 --> 00:17:59.125
scriptures it’s clearly written, “Without Atmasakshatkar

00:17:59.291 --> 00:18:03.291
your life is useless.” But what is Atmasakshatkar,

00:18:03.458 --> 00:18:07.625
is the knowledge about yourself. How can you have that knowledge

00:18:08.041 --> 00:18:13.000
unless and until you become one with this all-pervading Power?

00:18:13.709 --> 00:18:18.542
So it was a very great thing, I felt, that this Sahasrara

00:18:18.709 --> 00:18:23.125
I could open in 1970.

00:18:24.417 --> 00:18:28.208
I realized I was overwhelmed

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:32.125
because I knew this is the only trouble,

00:18:32.333 --> 00:18:35.333
it is the only obstacle human beings are having:

00:18:35.667 --> 00:18:40.208
because their Sahasraras are not open, that’s why they are

00:18:40.625 --> 00:18:45.500
going in the darkness, that’s why they are having wars,

00:18:46.083 --> 00:18:49.500
that’s why they are having all kinds of problems.

00:18:49.709 --> 00:18:52.375
But if their Sahasrara opens

00:18:52.709 --> 00:18:55.417
and if they become one with the divine Power,

00:18:56.458 --> 00:18:59.041
all their problems would be solved,

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:02.166
every type of problem will be solved

00:19:02.458 --> 00:19:04.333
and they’ll be very happy people.

00:19:05.083 --> 00:19:08.709
I realized it and I was very happy, I was over-joyous.

00:19:09.417 --> 00:19:12.458
But nobody understood Me.

00:19:13.041 --> 00:19:17.125
I don’t know, they thought I must be talking something nonsensical.

00:19:17.458 --> 00:19:19.667
Nobody understood it what it is,

00:19:20.208 --> 00:19:24.375
because even in the shastras it’s not written

00:19:26.709 --> 00:19:29.375
about kundalini so clearly.

00:19:29.709 --> 00:19:33.542
Only one great saint called Gyaneshwara

00:19:34.208 --> 00:19:38.417
wrote it in his book in the sixth chapter, about the kundalini.

00:19:39.083 --> 00:19:43.083
It’s not so clear, only he said that with the kundalini

00:19:43.291 --> 00:19:45.625
you can get your awakening.

00:19:46.083 --> 00:19:48.667
Also you sing that song always I’ve heard,

00:19:49.166 --> 00:19:53.375
which says that “Oh Kundalini Mother, please be awakened!”

00:19:54.083 --> 00:19:58.166
But nobody knows that what this kundalini is

00:19:58.333 --> 00:20:00.709
and why are you singing that song.

00:20:01.417 --> 00:20:05.083
It was all in our country people used to sing in the village

00:20:06.041 --> 00:20:10.667
so clearly, but nobody understood the meaning of it.

00:20:11.208 --> 00:20:15.417
Just they used to sing as a, some sort of a bhajan or could be

00:20:15.583 --> 00:20:18.333
some sort of a music concert.

00:20:18.542 --> 00:20:21.375
But nobody knew what it was talking about.

00:20:22.041 --> 00:20:24.333
It was such a misunderstanding about everything.

00:20:25.166 --> 00:20:29.583
And all these poets also who have written

00:20:30.208 --> 00:20:35.417
clearly about awakening, about realization,

00:20:36.041 --> 00:20:39.125
everything was just in the books.

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:43.000
They would read one line of the book, then stop there.

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:45.458
Another person would start the another line,

00:20:45.667 --> 00:20:48.083
then he stops at another line, point;

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:50.166
like that they were just reading.

00:20:50.417 --> 00:20:54.125
Same thing about all the scriptures.

00:20:54.583 --> 00:20:58.375
There was big misunderstanding created

00:20:59.125 --> 00:21:04.208
and was used for the purpose of their own self-interest.

00:21:05.166 --> 00:21:08.375
That is how we couldn’t get people

00:21:08.542 --> 00:21:11.208
who understood what was Self-realization.

00:21:12.166 --> 00:21:14.041
It was just for some money

00:21:14.291 --> 00:21:18.375
or for some certain type of a position to get,

00:21:18.667 --> 00:21:25.375
people started big, big organizations,

00:21:26.125 --> 00:21:30.625
very big religious organizations

00:21:31.125 --> 00:21:32.542
I don’t know what to call them –

00:21:33.041 --> 00:21:35.583
but none of them were realized souls.

00:21:36.625 --> 00:21:40.709
For example, there was a great saint called Viditama

00:21:41.542 --> 00:21:48.458
who went to China, and he started a religion called Zen.

00:21:49.375 --> 00:21:51.375
Zen means dhyana.

00:21:51.667 --> 00:21:56.500
And he wanted to put Zen

00:21:57.041 --> 00:22:01.000
in such a manner  that people become thoughtless

00:22:02.125 --> 00:22:05.333
He made a big tank

00:22:06.375 --> 00:22:11.083
full of sand with patterns and put some stones,

00:22:11.625 --> 00:22:17.208
and he had said that “You sit on the edge of this pond

00:22:17.709 --> 00:22:22.333
and just see, but don’t think.”

00:22:22.709 --> 00:22:24.709
People didn’t understand what it was.

00:22:25.125 --> 00:22:27.458
Normally anybody would go there and say,

00:22:27.542 --> 00:22:32.583
“Oh, this looks like some ships in the sea,” or all kinds of things.

00:22:33.166 --> 00:22:35.583
But nobody tried for thoughtless awareness.

00:22:37.417 --> 00:22:41.333
And I told some of them that this is for thoughtless awareness,

00:22:41.583 --> 00:22:44.083
but they couldn’t understand.

00:22:45.333 --> 00:22:49.583
Then we have also in Japan, Tao.

00:22:51.291 --> 00:22:54.709
He talked about the all-pervading Power which was Tao,

00:22:55.667 --> 00:22:58.709
and Lao-Tze was the one who did.

00:22:59.333 --> 00:23:03.375
He had described saints: how the saints are,

00:23:03.542 --> 00:23:06.709
how they behave, how they talk,

00:23:07.458 --> 00:23:11.166
what is their mannerism, everything.

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:14.667
But how you become a saint, nobody said.

00:23:15.375 --> 00:23:19.208
I think throughout there has been no description

00:23:19.458 --> 00:23:25.041
how to make a person into a saintly personality.

00:23:46.542 --> 00:23:49.333
So also in the twelfth century

00:23:52.166 --> 00:23:55.417
Gyaneshwara was in the twelfth century

00:23:56.041 --> 00:23:59.667
he talked about it and he said about it in his book, everything.

00:24:00.542 --> 00:24:03.375
Because it was a kind of a

00:24:03.709 --> 00:24:07.709
style that a guru should have only one disciple,

00:24:08.542 --> 00:24:12.583
who should give to one disciple realization, not to many.

00:24:13.083 --> 00:24:17.166
I don’t know why, what made them such a law or a rule.

00:24:17.709 --> 00:24:22.166
And then it started in the twelfth century, there were many saints

00:24:24.458 --> 00:24:29.000
who sang the praise of realization.

00:24:30.291 --> 00:24:33.500
And all of them thought that these rituals are no good,

00:24:33.709 --> 00:24:36.458
so they discarded rituals and this.

00:24:37.083 --> 00:24:40.583
But what was the thing that had to happen, nobody knew.

00:24:42.041 --> 00:24:45.542
I have read all their lives,

00:24:46.083 --> 00:24:50.083
I’ve read afterwards also many saints who were there,

00:24:51.458 --> 00:24:56.166
but it seems nobody knew how to raise the kundalini.

00:24:57.208 --> 00:24:59.250
This was the basic problem,

00:24:59.417 --> 00:25:01.709
they didn’t know how to raise the kundalini;

00:25:02.667 --> 00:25:05.458
while I think they didn’t have that power,

00:25:06.166 --> 00:25:08.417
or maybe they had no knowledge.

00:25:08.583 --> 00:25:11.125
They talked about kundalini, all right,

00:25:11.417 --> 00:25:14.709
but they did not know how to raise the kundalini.

00:25:16.458 --> 00:25:21.000
This is a very special power of spirituality.

00:25:21.667 --> 00:25:24.250
None of them have been able

00:25:24.375 --> 00:25:27.542
to say or tell you how to raise the kundalini.

00:25:28.166 --> 00:25:31.000
Now you all have got this power,

00:25:31.333 --> 00:25:33.333
which is such a rare thing.

00:25:33.542 --> 00:25:35.458
All of you have got it,

00:25:35.625 --> 00:25:39.125
I don’t see anybody who doesn’t have that power

00:25:39.458 --> 00:25:42.291
to raise the kundalini. You may not;

00:25:42.542 --> 00:25:45.166
you may be contented with yourself,

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:47.333
but that’s not a very good thing.

00:25:47.625 --> 00:25:52.166
If you have got your Sahasrara opened out

00:25:52.375 --> 00:25:55.291
and if you know how to raise the kundalini,

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:58.500
you must go all out to give realization to people.

00:26:00.417 --> 00:26:05.375
Nothing is going to benefit people more than Self-realization.

00:26:06.208 --> 00:26:10.166
No use doing other charities, giving money, giving this

00:26:10.417 --> 00:26:14.667
is of no use. Best thing is to go all out

00:26:15.208 --> 00:26:17.667
to see people who want their realization,

00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:20.250
and to give them realization.

00:26:20.375 --> 00:26:22.291
I was very happy to see

00:26:22.583 --> 00:26:26.709
that they have started working it out on the gypsies.

00:26:27.375 --> 00:26:29.542
I’ve a special feeling for gypsies.

00:26:30.166 --> 00:26:34.125
For no fault of theirs, they are leading a very miserable life.

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:37.709
And how the gypsies got the realization!

00:26:38.667 --> 00:26:43.250
You can see that you can give it to anyone

00:26:44.125 --> 00:26:48.417
who wants to have it. One thing is there you cannot force on anyone.

00:26:49.542 --> 00:26:52.333
If they have a desire,

00:26:52.542 --> 00:26:55.125
they can get Self-realization.

00:26:55.333 --> 00:26:59.375
So this day, I have to just say now so many years have passed,

00:26:59.667 --> 00:27:03.166
I have worked quite hard, day and night,

00:27:04.083 --> 00:27:06.542
and My only desire was

00:27:07.125 --> 00:27:12.083
that you people should take  it seriously and work it out.

00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:14.542
Don’t keep your realization to yourself.

00:27:15.083 --> 00:27:18.250
As many as people you can give realization,

00:27:18.583 --> 00:27:22.417
the greatest obligation will be on Me

00:27:23.166 --> 00:27:27.125
and on God Almighty. Only thing is you should try

00:27:27.375 --> 00:27:29.625
to give realizations to others.

00:27:30.125 --> 00:27:32.375
You will never make a mistake,

00:27:32.542 --> 00:27:35.667
you can never make a mistake because the kundalini knows.

00:27:36.208 --> 00:27:39.291
She knows you, she knows you are realized soul.

00:27:39.458 --> 00:27:41.000
She’llrespect you.

00:27:41.291 --> 00:27:44.333
Even if you make mistakes she’ll correct it

00:27:44.542 --> 00:27:47.625
and she’ll help you, in every way.

00:27:49.125 --> 00:27:52.291
I’m just a, I should say a housewife

00:27:54.083 --> 00:27:58.417
who had no support from anyone.

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:03.375
But I was sure that it’s My job to find out

00:28:04.208 --> 00:28:06.166
how to break the Sahasrara.

00:28:07.125 --> 00:28:10.083
Whatever way it is – outside doesn’t matter –

00:28:10.458 --> 00:28:16.375
My job it was to find out the breaking of Sahasrara, which I did.

00:28:16.709 --> 00:28:21.041
Now you also know that, so this is your job.

00:28:21.291 --> 00:28:23.208
And the scientists now will be coming around

00:28:23.375 --> 00:28:25.041
you to ask you questions,

00:28:25.291 --> 00:28:28.417
because they don’t know what they are talking about is

00:28:28.667 --> 00:28:30.709
what we are already doing.

00:28:31.333 --> 00:28:36.291
So you are so powerful, all of you. But how many of you are really

00:28:36.709 --> 00:28:38.709
doing this work, is the point.

00:28:39.542 --> 00:28:42.542
Today is a very important day. I want to tell you

00:28:43.417 --> 00:28:47.667
that you have to strengthen My hands.

00:28:49.375 --> 00:28:52.041
They say the Goddess has one thousand hands,

00:28:52.542 --> 00:28:56.458
but even the one thousand hands are now asking

00:28:56.583 --> 00:29:00.375
that you come along with your two hands and work it out.

00:29:01.041 --> 00:29:03.166
It’s very important what you have to do.

00:29:04.125 --> 00:29:09.625
All kinds of problems in this world, they come because of ignorance

00:29:10.542 --> 00:29:13.500
take it politics, take it any, any problem.

00:29:14.208 --> 00:29:16.291
And how it is solved is also,

00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:21.667
is your power with the Divine.

00:29:22.458 --> 00:29:25.041
I’ll give you one simple example.

00:29:25.375 --> 00:29:28.375
That day the Turkish people came

00:29:29.333 --> 00:29:31.208
and were begging of Me, “Mother,

00:29:31.375 --> 00:29:33.208
You must come. You should not postpone,”

00:29:33.417 --> 00:29:36.500
and this passport, My passport was a problem.  I said,

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:39.625
“The passport is not ready, how will I come?”

00:29:40.375 --> 00:29:43.583
But then I thought, “Why not? We’ll have the passport also done.”

00:29:44.166 --> 00:29:45.709
So passport was ready.

00:29:46.542 --> 00:29:49.542
And they wanted Me to go to Turkey because they said,

00:29:49.709 --> 00:29:51.583
“The financial condition has gone down very much,

00:29:51.709 --> 00:29:54.625
the economy has gone down absolutely, we are ruined.”

00:29:55.709 --> 00:29:59.041
I went there, I didn’t do anything about it;

00:29:59.625 --> 00:30:03.333
within two days they announced

00:30:03.667 --> 00:30:06.709
ten billion dollar help from the World Bank.

00:30:07.583 --> 00:30:11.458
Now I didn’t talk to World Bank, I had nothing to do with them,

00:30:11.625 --> 00:30:13.583
I don’t know.

00:30:14.125 --> 00:30:17.458
Then I said, “No, maybe you see, they are helping because

00:30:17.667 --> 00:30:19.417
you people are in such trouble.

00:30:19.542 --> 00:30:21.333
” They said, “But so many countries are,

00:30:21.542 --> 00:30:23.625
why have they helped us only?”

00:30:24.583 --> 00:30:26.250
I said, “That’s the point!”

00:30:26.583 --> 00:30:29.458
So now I was surprised, in Turkey

00:30:29.625 --> 00:30:33.208
there are only ladies mostly who are leaders, mostly,

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.250
and they have done such a big job.

00:30:36.417 --> 00:30:40.542
Now I want to see what you people are doing in your country.

00:30:41.291 --> 00:30:45.208
You may say that “In my country the people are hopelessly bad.”

00:30:45.417 --> 00:30:47.542
Maybe, I don’t say no.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.667
But still there are places, there are pockets

00:30:52.375 --> 00:30:55.500
where you can go and talk to them, tell them,

00:30:55.667 --> 00:30:58.291
specially the media you must handle.

00:30:59.417 --> 00:31:05.417
It is something you have to do, and find out why you can’t do it.

00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:10.208
Like Me: I was not supported by anybody,

00:31:10.375 --> 00:31:11.709
not helped by anybody,

00:31:12.208 --> 00:31:15.583
and how I have managed to break the Sahasrara –

00:31:16.125 --> 00:31:18.583
you can also break the Sahasraras of others.

00:31:19.542 --> 00:31:22.709
It’s not difficult, because My vision is

00:31:23.417 --> 00:31:25.583
that this world

00:31:26.125 --> 00:31:29.709
at least should have forty percent people who are realized souls

00:31:31.041 --> 00:31:34.625
and who are practicing Sahaja Yoga,

00:31:35.458 --> 00:31:38.500
who are giving realization to people

00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:42.125
and trying to change the people.

00:31:43.166 --> 00:31:46.041
Anybody who can go and tell, anybody.

00:31:46.458 --> 00:31:48.667
There’s no need to discriminate

00:31:49.083 --> 00:31:51.166
or to find out, or sit down with their

00:31:51.417 --> 00:31:54.417
I mean people take sometimes the

00:31:54.709 --> 00:32:00.208
copy of their education and this; that's not needed.

00:32:01.375 --> 00:32:03.583
Whosoever it is.

00:32:04.083 --> 00:32:07.500
I’m not saying give it to dogs or to animals,

00:32:08.083 --> 00:32:12.709
but to human beings. They may be anything;

00:32:13.333 --> 00:32:17.208
they may be English or they could be Germans,

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:24.041
they could be Italians anywhere.

00:32:24.667 --> 00:32:26.583
I am told also some people

00:32:26.709 --> 00:32:29.500
are doing lots of seminars and working very hard

00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:33.125
on all levels, and it is working out.

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:36.333
Among Muslims also we have started working,

00:32:36.583 --> 00:32:39.166
and even in India it has worked.

00:32:39.709 --> 00:32:42.625
You don’t know, people have not lost all their heads,

00:32:43.125 --> 00:32:44.625
so it can work out.

00:32:45.125 --> 00:32:48.667
Don’t be very much disappointed and upset about it;

00:32:49.542 --> 00:32:53.291
gradually it will improve. I think the greatest enemy

00:32:53.583 --> 00:32:58.250
of our Self-realization is the drinking.

00:32:59.333 --> 00:33:03.083
Drinking, if people take to drinking they become such slaves,

00:33:03.542 --> 00:33:06.417
they don’t – their brains are not all right.

00:33:07.291 --> 00:33:11.625
So I think the Sahasrara also must be spoilt with drinking.

00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:14.667
So drinking I think is the worst enemy.

00:33:15.583 --> 00:33:18.250
And if you could find anybody drinking,

00:33:18.458 --> 00:33:21.375
if you could help that man to give up drinking itself,

00:33:21.625 --> 00:33:25.667
it will work out.  Of course we have other enemies also,

00:33:26.208 --> 00:33:30.542
like false gurus are there. Also we have other enemies

00:33:31.041 --> 00:33:37.625
who are having some sort of religious manipulations,

00:33:38.166 --> 00:33:40.041
but that’s not so important.

00:33:40.625 --> 00:33:43.458
If you can get hold of people who are drinking,

00:33:44.458 --> 00:33:49.125
I tell you it will change. And they will now understand

00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:52.250
that what they have been doing so far, drinking,

00:33:52.458 --> 00:33:55.166
running away – now they’ll come

00:33:55.333 --> 00:33:58.041
to the fields and they’ll work out Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:58.625 --> 00:34:03.333
So you are like very gentle soldiers of love,

00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:06.500
and that’s what you have to spread

00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:11.208
and talk to others, give them that joy that you have.

00:34:11.667 --> 00:34:16.625
Not be satisfied if you have got it only, or few of you have it.

00:34:17.333 --> 00:34:20.166
You have to spread it very fast, and you can do it.

00:34:20.417 --> 00:34:24.417
Because it doesn’t require money, it doesn’t require any show;

00:34:24.709 --> 00:34:28.166
it is just inside, it works, it’s already there.

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:32.041
It’s present there, everybody has it. I knew all that,

00:34:32.375 --> 00:34:35.458
of course I knew it; but now you also know it.

00:34:35.667 --> 00:34:39.250
So you should work it out, and work it out in the manner

00:34:39.583 --> 00:34:44.709
that I am sure one day this world will be a changed place.

00:34:45.542 --> 00:34:47.417
Thank you very much.
