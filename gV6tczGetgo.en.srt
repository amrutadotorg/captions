1
00:03:57,803 --> 00:03:59,891
Something wrong.

2
00:04:01,065 --> 00:04:04,548
Who has made those with the things…
(hindi).

3
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:12,189
You should put more of cotton in that,
you see, slips back. (Hindi)

4
00:04:18,408 --> 00:04:20,963
Can you get it done by the… (hindi).

5
00:04:43,344 --> 00:04:45,727
You for pujas you must use Indian girls,
better,

6
00:04:45,927 --> 00:04:48,367
they know all these things better you see.

7
00:04:48,567 --> 00:04:53,451
They said that nobody asked us, so
they just sit on the fence.

8
00:06:46,312 --> 00:06:50,465
They would think that we should not come
forward, because they’ll think

9
00:06:50,665 --> 00:06:53,840
these people are talking too much,
these Indians,

10
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,724
so… I mean, they – when they have to come
they should come.

11
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:07,161
You can see, yesterday’s film, that we
have a tradition,

12
00:07:07,361 --> 00:07:12,261
you see, we know all these things, isn’t it?
This has been there in that country,

13
00:07:12,461 --> 00:07:18,954
so they should tell you, and you should
not mind that.

14
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:26,204
They also have the same fear as you have
that they will say “You have a ego”.

15
00:07:26,597 --> 00:07:31,201
I don’t know how to go about with anything.

16
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:11,766
It’s quite warm. (Hindi)

17
00:10:17,141 --> 00:10:19,422
It’s alright.

18
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:40,363
I’ll teach you how to make this, alright?
May God bless you.

19
00:10:58,835 --> 00:11:05,021
Today I was thinking that we’ll do the puja
to Mahalakshmi. Will be better,

20
00:11:05,221 --> 00:11:11,316
so that we'll understand what is Vishwa
Nirmala Dharma is.

21
00:11:14,744 --> 00:11:21,342
As you know, the Mahalakshmi principle lies
within all of you, in the center.

22
00:11:21,542 --> 00:11:27,989
And once you are fed up with the falsehood,

23
00:11:28,189 --> 00:11:35,160
and also with the hypocrisy of people,

24
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:40,815
you start seeking the truth within.

25
00:11:41,015 --> 00:11:48,329
That's how a new category of people are
born, who are called as seekers - sadhakas.

26
00:11:48,529 --> 00:11:52,492
They are very different from others.

27
00:11:53,289 --> 00:12:00,944
They don't care for any material gain

28
00:12:01,711 --> 00:12:09,801
or any power, position.

29
00:12:10,001 --> 00:12:18,271
They want to seek the truth and this
category is the one you are,

30
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:22,489
and that's why you have come to Sahaja
Yoga.

31
00:12:23,419 --> 00:12:27,802
This comes from your past lives also.

32
00:12:28,002 --> 00:12:30,978
For many people, I think, it's their
past life

33
00:12:31,178 --> 00:12:34,874
which has brought this seeking in them.

34
00:12:35,074 --> 00:12:40,687
Also the affluence through which you have
gone, you got fed up with it,

35
00:12:40,887 --> 00:12:44,814
and you are seeking the truth.

36
00:12:46,962 --> 00:12:51,949
Also, there are people, like in India,
where the tradition is to seek the truth,

37
00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:56,016
from very childhood you are told that money
is not everything,

38
00:12:56,216 --> 00:12:59,535
power is not everything, it’s all falsehood,
you must seek the truth.

39
00:12:59,735 --> 00:13:01,588
So, you are ingrained with it.

40
00:13:01,788 --> 00:13:06,854
These are called as good conditionings,
'su-sanskara'.

41
00:13:07,054 --> 00:13:21,387
Now, if it is the - just a fashion sort
of a thing,

42
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:25,973
that you get into fashion, that let us seek
the truth

43
00:13:26,173 --> 00:13:32,181
because everybody is talking about truth,
let us have this as a fashion

44
00:13:32,381 --> 00:13:36,089
because everybody is doing it, you see.

45
00:13:36,289 --> 00:13:45,421
Then it can be very dangerous. Such people
get lost.

46
00:13:45,621 --> 00:13:52,346
I've seen people who were drug addicts,
who came to us first in England.

47
00:13:53,057 --> 00:13:56,037
And I was surprised that they were really
seekers,

48
00:13:56,237 --> 00:14:00,527
and they were not taking drugs because
of fashion.

49
00:14:00,727 --> 00:14:04,485
They were just taking it, because they
thought, by taking drugs,

50
00:14:04,685 --> 00:14:09,797
they will get into their Mahalakshmi
principle.

51
00:14:10,506 --> 00:14:15,864
Very intelligent, educated, very smart,
I should say,

52
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:20,709
people became hippies and they started
taking drugs.

53
00:14:20,909 --> 00:14:28,592
I discovered that their seeking was only
that they should find the truth.

54
00:14:28,792 --> 00:14:33,148
But they had no idea as to what is
the truth is.

55
00:14:33,348 --> 00:14:37,904
So, this Mahalakshmi principle was born
within them.

56
00:14:38,104 --> 00:14:41,093
Sort of started manifesting,

57
00:14:41,293 --> 00:14:45,682
that 'beyond all this there must be
something'.

58
00:14:47,417 --> 00:14:53,065
This category of people are everywhere
in the world.

59
00:14:53,929 --> 00:15:00,697
Especially, I was surprised, in Russia,
where there is no talk of God,

60
00:15:00,897 --> 00:15:03,948
there is no talk of religion.

61
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:11,974
They are even better than Indians in
understanding Sahaja Yoga.

62
00:15:12,174 --> 00:15:19,668
So the conditionings of every country
has also hampered

63
00:15:19,868 --> 00:15:25,315
the progress of Sahaja Yoga within you
and outside.

64
00:15:26,378 --> 00:15:30,253
So now, first of all to understand
Mahalakshmi principle

65
00:15:30,453 --> 00:15:35,407
we must know that we have two other
channels into which we can jump.

66
00:15:35,607 --> 00:15:38,297
One is the left another is the right

67
00:15:38,497 --> 00:15:43,625
and it depends on what sort of a background
you had in this life.

68
00:15:43,825 --> 00:15:47,521
Because of your background in last life,
you have come to the right path.

69
00:15:47,721 --> 00:15:54,138
But last life is been (being?) covered
by this life.

70
00:15:54,338 --> 00:16:00,102
The surroundings, the country in which you
are born, your friends, parents,

71
00:16:00,302 --> 00:16:07,769
the society in which you lived, has
dominated you in so many ways

72
00:16:08,948 --> 00:16:18,907
that the Mahalakshmi principle doesn't
express itself in that full power

73
00:16:19,107 --> 00:16:22,790
which should really suck in everything else

74
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:28,803
and put you onto the throne of a sahaja yogi.

75
00:16:30,272 --> 00:16:35,279
So you find people - yesterday there were
so many people for example,

76
00:16:35,479 --> 00:16:42,033
very nice people, they were all seekers
of many lives who came there,

77
00:16:42,233 --> 00:16:48,671
but we do not know how many will come
to Sahaja Yoga

78
00:16:48,871 --> 00:16:53,191
and how many will settle down in Sahaja Yoga,

79
00:16:54,308 --> 00:17:01,400
how many will achieve doubtless awareness.

80
00:17:01,966 --> 00:17:09,804
Again the same problem, that they
start getting

81
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:15,826
into the habits formed by the left side

82
00:17:16,026 --> 00:17:21,918
or into the ego formed by the right side.

83
00:17:22,118 --> 00:17:27,002
Now for a Sahaja Yogi to keep his
Mahalakshmi principle all right -

84
00:17:27,202 --> 00:17:33,294
has to always introspect, not to look
at others but to introspect.

85
00:17:33,494 --> 00:17:35,995
"What am I doing?

86
00:17:36,195 --> 00:17:41,991
Am I in the left side or on the right side?

87
00:17:42,191 --> 00:17:44,625
Which side [am] I moving?

88
00:17:44,825 --> 00:17:53,364
What side I’m following? Am I in the center?"

89
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:01,578
Now how will you judge? The best is to feel
your vibrations,

90
00:18:01,778 --> 00:18:07,795
feel your vibrations. But sometimes you
go so far

91
00:18:07,995 --> 00:18:12,281
to the left or to the right, that you just
do not feel vibrations.

92
00:18:12,481 --> 00:18:17,022
Your Mahalakshmi principle is not working.

93
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:22,736
Then you go on. It's like a complete
derailment, I should say,

94
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:28,288
a kind of a slope on which you just go on
falling on to that.

95
00:18:29,422 --> 00:18:33,004
So all these conditionings we should
watch out,

96
00:18:33,204 --> 00:18:37,642
in ourselves and in others - how we have
got these problems

97
00:18:37,842 --> 00:18:42,821
that we slip out from the central path.
Imagine a train is going

98
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:49,144
on a proper railway track and suddenly
it starts moving this way or that way.

99
00:18:49,344 --> 00:18:55,499
So, where will it end up? Into destruction
going. But you have a way

100
00:18:55,699 --> 00:19:03,031
of arranging that this derailment can be
brought back to the middle path.

101
00:19:03,231 --> 00:19:08,977
So in a very detached way if you look
at yourself like a witness

102
00:19:09,177 --> 00:19:12,342
and see for yourself, not about others...
even when I give lectures

103
00:19:12,542 --> 00:19:14,394
people start saying, "Oh Mother is saying
about somebody else."

104
00:19:14,594 --> 00:19:19,120
No, I am saying about you, yourself.
So you watch out that,

105
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:26,876
"Are you in the center or are you going
to the left or to the right."

106
00:19:27,283 --> 00:19:33,610
First of all, those who are in the center
should not have any physical problems.

107
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:38,943
Should be able to completely cure
themselves.

108
00:19:39,143 --> 00:19:43,483
If not others, they should be able to cure
themselves.

109
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:52,864
Secondly, a person who is in the center
is a very peaceful person.

110
00:19:53,064 --> 00:19:57,175
He is never angry. He might put up a show
that you are angry.

111
00:19:57,375 --> 00:20:03,236
But he doesn't get involved into anger
or any emotions whatsoever.

112
00:20:03,436 --> 00:20:11,438
He just watches and he can act. He can act
to be in that feeling

113
00:20:11,638 --> 00:20:19,301
of temper also lust, greed, anything -
but just to act.

114
00:20:19,501 --> 00:20:24,360
Because sometimes this acting is needed
so he can use it.

115
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:28,496
But you should be sure, first of all, that
you are completely detached.

116
00:20:28,696 --> 00:20:33,602
So first of all, before acting you must
become a master of acting.

117
00:20:33,802 --> 00:20:40,632
And for that you have to become your Self.
If you become your Self

118
00:20:40,832 --> 00:20:48,321
then you are a master and you can see
where are you going.

119
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:56,631
Now the difference between a sahaja yogi
and a sahaja yogi who is like this,

120
00:20:56,831 --> 00:21:02,926
as you say, is this, that he is capable
of going to the left or to the right.

121
00:21:03,126 --> 00:21:06,691
They are not solidly sahaja yogis,

122
00:21:07,341 --> 00:21:10,428
and they go on like this and there is
no progress. Imagine

123
00:21:10,628 --> 00:21:13,925
any airplane which is wobbling like that:
will be on the ground only.

124
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:20,754
Nobody will be able to put it up in the air,

125
00:21:20,954 --> 00:21:25,265
because God knows what time -
when will it fall down.

126
00:21:25,465 --> 00:21:29,295
So for any machinery, we have to fix it up
properly first,

127
00:21:29,495 --> 00:21:35,146
before we start working it out.
To fix up our

128
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:41,333
Mahalakshmi principle, you have to see
that your physical being

129
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:44,700
is all right, is normal, no problem.

130
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:48,761
I am not meaning the modern ways
of looking at health

131
00:21:48,961 --> 00:21:52,112
but that you should feel healthy and happy.

132
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:56,692
You should feel that there is no problem
with your physical being.

133
00:21:56,892 --> 00:22:01,025
But if you are a complaining type (like)
I am here paining, I’m paining there,

134
00:22:01,225 --> 00:22:04,409
then there is something wrong with you.

135
00:22:06,735 --> 00:22:13,077
This is the first criteria that you are
in the center.

136
00:22:14,075 --> 00:22:20,240
Then your attention should be more
towards nature -

137
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:25,800
how the nature is, how it is blossoming,
how it is working out.

138
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,422
It should be towards the sky, stars
and things.

139
00:22:29,622 --> 00:22:34,612
Just to enjoy all the creation that is
around, just to enjoy it.

140
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:41,596
That’s an enjoyment which is really
so surprisingly deep.

141
00:22:41,796 --> 00:22:45,309
When you see something, beautiful scene
or something -

142
00:22:45,509 --> 00:22:51,376
you go to a very beautiful place, then
a kind of a joy that pours in you

143
00:22:51,576 --> 00:22:55,945
from your Sahastrara, that also you
must experience.

144
00:22:56,145 --> 00:22:59,421
Also you must experience your thoughtless
awareness,

145
00:22:59,621 --> 00:23:04,758
that is when you look at something beautiful
you should suddenly become thoughtless.

146
00:23:04,958 --> 00:23:11,659
Just start seeing it. The whole joy will
start pouring on you.

147
00:23:11,859 --> 00:23:19,706
Then another thing is that you should not
differentiate between religions.

148
00:23:19,906 --> 00:23:23,173
You should not condemn any religion.

149
00:23:23,373 --> 00:23:28,200
But the people who are stupid and call
themselves religious,

150
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,843
they can be condemned, because they are
stupid.

151
00:23:31,043 --> 00:23:34,169
They have not followed the principle
of religion at all.

152
00:23:34,369 --> 00:23:39,541
They are not realized souls and that's what
they are making a mistake.

153
00:23:39,741 --> 00:23:43,879
So that's all right. For example churches
can be condemned,

154
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:49,984
but not Christ, not the Bible, not at all,
never.

155
00:23:50,184 --> 00:23:54,627
So, when you see to the roots - roots are
all right, but now as I said,

156
00:23:54,827 --> 00:23:59,213
that these flowers have been plucked
by people and they are fighting.

157
00:23:59,413 --> 00:24:03,711
So you should never condemn any incarnation,

158
00:24:03,911 --> 00:24:10,053
any religion, any prophet.

159
00:24:10,253 --> 00:24:13,307
I mean you will not condemn. It is not
question of I’m saying, "Don't do it".

160
00:24:13,507 --> 00:24:17,884
You will just not do it. You will respect
all of them automatically,

161
00:24:18,084 --> 00:24:22,382
because now you are born into it. If you,
say, are a Christian,

162
00:24:22,582 --> 00:24:25,530
you will respect Hindu scriptures.

163
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:29,467
If you are a Hindu you’ll respect
an Islamic Quran.

164
00:24:29,667 --> 00:24:32,436
That has to be there. If it is not so,

165
00:24:32,636 --> 00:24:37,197
then please know that you are not yet a sahaja yogi.

166
00:24:37,397 --> 00:24:41,625
There should be no malice about any
religion whatsoever.

167
00:24:41,825 --> 00:24:45,030
No religion has done any wrong so far.

168
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:49,430
It's the people who follow them in a wrong
way, use it for money,

169
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:56,398
use it for power and also are stupid.
For them it's different.

170
00:24:56,598 --> 00:25:02,554
But for you, every religion is your
own religion.

171
00:25:02,754 --> 00:25:06,446
So we cannot be fundamentalist.

172
00:25:06,646 --> 00:25:09,951
We cannot fight for fundamentalism.

173
00:25:10,151 --> 00:25:14,797
Vishwa Nirmala Dharma which is based
on the Mahalakshmi principle,

174
00:25:14,997 --> 00:25:22,528
is the essence of all the religions,
the truth of all the religions.

175
00:25:22,728 --> 00:25:28,318
And we seek with our pursuits

176
00:25:28,518 --> 00:25:33,202
what are the common points in all these
religions. We try to neutralise

177
00:25:33,402 --> 00:25:36,960
which are not common points

178
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:41,708
and find out with our research/pursuits

179
00:25:41,908 --> 00:25:49,006
that this one was not the correct thing,
but is not in the religion,

180
00:25:49,206 --> 00:25:54,814
people are following like that. There are
so many things you can find out.

181
00:25:55,014 --> 00:26:01,495
If in the Bible, if you remove Paul
you will cleanse most of it.

182
00:26:01,695 --> 00:26:05,753
If Paul is not there, I tell you, most
of the Christianity can be cleansed out,

183
00:26:05,953 --> 00:26:09,774
because he started confessions, he started
all this nonsense.

184
00:26:09,974 --> 00:26:13,077
He started making people feel guilty,
I mean,

185
00:26:13,277 --> 00:26:17,501
and treating women as nothing.
All Mr. Paul has done it

186
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:22,802
and he had no right to be there in the
Bible ibecause he never knew Christ.

187
00:26:23,865 --> 00:26:28,226
He was an epileptic and he saw some cross
means some sort of a...

188
00:26:28,426 --> 00:26:34,369
I don't know how far it is truth. But he
said he saw a cross. So what?

189
00:26:34,569 --> 00:26:38,151
Seeing the cross doesn't mean you become
the cross.

190
00:26:38,351 --> 00:26:45,243
Also he wanted to jump on the platform.
Nice platform is made, all right, for you.

191
00:26:45,443 --> 00:26:53,963
And he has powers, and he wants to have
powers, so, he jumps on the platform.

192
00:26:54,163 --> 00:26:58,522
Then he organizes Christianity.
All his mistery.

193
00:26:58,722 --> 00:27:01,524
Never in the Bible is said, never
Christ said,

194
00:27:01,724 --> 00:27:06,188
that you should organize Christianity,
nor has He said

195
00:27:06,388 --> 00:27:10,976
that you should confess or you should
feel guilty.

196
00:27:11,176 --> 00:27:15,189
All the time He has been talking
of forgiveness.

197
00:27:15,389 --> 00:27:19,126
In that short time also, He has given
the truth to us.

198
00:27:19,326 --> 00:27:27,080
But I mean, if somebody wants to interpret,
then it goes wrong.

199
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:32,291
So this - another point of a sahaja yogi is,
whatever I say

200
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:36,906
they don't have to interpret, they know it
exactly what I say.

201
00:27:37,106 --> 00:27:41,235
If they start interpreting, then there is
something wrong with them.

202
00:27:41,435 --> 00:27:45,517
Their brains are not all right, they are
not normal. You cannot interpret Me.

203
00:27:45,717 --> 00:27:49,135
Whatever I say, I say in a very simple
English language.

204
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:52,365
I do not use Shakespearean language
or something like that.

205
00:27:52,565 --> 00:28:00,188
I modulated My Standard of English up to
the normal common people’s language,

206
00:28:00,388 --> 00:28:03,454
and if you start interpreting it,

207
00:28:03,654 --> 00:28:08,359
that means something definitely very,
very wrong with you.

208
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:11,806
There is nothing to interpret. I am saying
straightforward things

209
00:28:12,006 --> 00:28:16,696
which need not be interpreted. This is
a very important thing.

210
00:28:16,896 --> 00:28:23,645
But many sahaja yogi's who are half-baked,
I should say, start interpreting Me,

211
00:28:23,845 --> 00:28:26,224
because they think they have brains
to interpret.

212
00:28:26,424 --> 00:28:32,671
You have no brains of that caliber that
you can interpret Me.

213
00:28:32,871 --> 00:28:36,337
There are no interpretations. Whatever
I have said, I have said it

214
00:28:36,537 --> 00:28:39,258
and there is no need to interpret.

215
00:28:39,458 --> 00:28:43,320
This is one of the signs that you are
not in the center.

216
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:48,982
Either you have been possessed or you
have become egoistical.

217
00:28:49,182 --> 00:28:56,380
So, one, to keep yourself in the center,
to be solidly sahaja yogis,

218
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:01,150
first of all there should be no
interpretations of what I say.

219
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:05,172
If you think that I am meaning something
else, you can write to Me,

220
00:29:05,372 --> 00:29:09,692
but don't interpret and start a big
organization

221
00:29:09,892 --> 00:29:17,371
against Sahaja Yoga. This is the greatest
mistake that people do it.

222
00:29:17,571 --> 00:29:22,027
I have told many people that you should not
give lectures about Sahaja Yoga.

223
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:25,242
Because once they start giving lectures,
also sometimes they get

224
00:29:25,442 --> 00:29:30,333
into derailment. Either they get egoistical
or they say things,

225
00:29:30,533 --> 00:29:35,853
as they say, out of their hats, which I
have never said, which are not to be said.

226
00:29:36,053 --> 00:29:39,411
So unless and until you are a solid
sahaja yogi,

227
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:43,474
I think you should not talk about Sahaja
Yoga. Best is to give realization.

228
00:29:43,674 --> 00:29:49,347
Though you are half-baked, you can give
realization. That's one point for sure.

229
00:29:49,547 --> 00:29:52,785
And those who will get will remain
sahaja yogis.

230
00:29:52,985 --> 00:29:57,263
I have seen people who have given
realization to others are gone cases,

231
00:29:57,463 --> 00:30:02,188
while those whom they have given
are perfect.

232
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:09,133
Now when somebody gives you
the realization, he is not your guru

233
00:30:09,333 --> 00:30:15,220
by any chance. He is not your guru and have
no sort of a awe

234
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:20,212
or an obligation towards that person
who has given you realization.

235
00:30:20,412 --> 00:30:25,940
If you do that way, then the ego
of that man wouldn't go away

236
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:29,568
and you will have conditioning.

237
00:30:29,768 --> 00:30:33,077
You will always stand by that person
though he has done wrong.

238
00:30:33,277 --> 00:30:36,051
Though he is absolutely not a sahaja yogi,
you will stand by that person.

239
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:41,442
With him you also move to the direction
in which he has moved.

240
00:30:41,642 --> 00:30:45,777
So in Mahalakshmi principle, one has
to be careful, absolutely,

241
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:49,501
to see where are we going.

242
00:30:51,338 --> 00:30:54,767
Now the group system starts, also with
the same.

243
00:30:54,967 --> 00:30:59,505
There is a big fraternity of 'bhoots',
I must tell you.

244
00:31:01,436 --> 00:31:05,159
If you go to the left, all the leftist
will join you.

245
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:08,354
If you go to the right, all the rightist
will join you.

246
00:31:08,554 --> 00:31:12,774
Then they’ll fight among themselves
and get out of it.

247
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:19,853
Now for sahaja yogis, who believe
in fighting back, in grouping back,

248
00:31:20,053 --> 00:31:24,094
they should know, they have derailed.
Maybe they were very intelligent,

249
00:31:24,294 --> 00:31:28,772
they thought they could do that, maybe.
But none intelligence,

250
00:31:28,972 --> 00:31:34,143
none of them are above the Divine
intelligence.

251
00:31:34,343 --> 00:31:37,097
But when you start moving out
of Mahalakshmi thing,

252
00:31:37,297 --> 00:31:42,424
you become like a common person, even
worse than a common person, I would say.

253
00:31:42,624 --> 00:31:49,073
So then you are grabbed by the negative
forces which are around us.

254
00:31:49,273 --> 00:31:55,796
Just like all others are grabbed, you are
also grabbed.

255
00:31:56,201 --> 00:32:02,573
There are conditionings, which also
we should see “do we have”.

256
00:32:02,773 --> 00:32:07,642
Say a western person must see western
conditionings

257
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:10,738
very clearly. What are these
conditionings? Because we are

258
00:32:10,938 --> 00:32:15,146
seekers of truth, we do not belong
to any country. We belong

259
00:32:15,346 --> 00:32:19,619
to the universe, Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.
We do not belong to Australia,

260
00:32:19,819 --> 00:32:23,563
we do not belong to Brisbane. You see
this belonging

261
00:32:23,763 --> 00:32:28,761
becomes so small and so mean that
ultimately it will become, we belong

262
00:32:28,961 --> 00:32:34,750
to this street and then we belong to this
room, and we belong to this bathroom.

263
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:37,978
Start going down, down, down, so much.

264
00:32:38,178 --> 00:32:42,773
While is it Vishwa Nirmala Dharma. Means
it is a universal religion,

265
00:32:42,973 --> 00:32:47,305
we belong to the universe. We are part
and parcel of the universe,

266
00:32:47,505 --> 00:32:53,462
not only belonging to one place or one
location. We cannot.

267
00:32:53,662 --> 00:32:58,783
Now we have gone into eternal life. We have
gone to something that is unlimited.

268
00:32:58,983 --> 00:33:01,694
So we belong to this universe.

269
00:33:01,894 --> 00:33:05,906
Once you realize that you belong to this
universe, you should also know

270
00:33:06,106 --> 00:33:09,932
what conditionings are still sticking on
to us

271
00:33:10,132 --> 00:33:16,531
from this country, from this culture,
from this place,

272
00:33:16,731 --> 00:33:19,979
from this household, from this family,

273
00:33:20,179 --> 00:33:24,429
like a little lotus that comes out
of the mud.

274
00:33:24,629 --> 00:33:29,124
Slowly, slowly it throws away all the mud
that is sticking on to it.

275
00:33:29,324 --> 00:33:34,784
Ultimately it comes out as a very
clean flower.

276
00:33:34,984 --> 00:33:38,373
From the mud it gets to the water,
cleanses itself

277
00:33:38,573 --> 00:33:42,519
and comes out as a beautiful flower,
absolutely fragrant,

278
00:33:42,719 --> 00:33:46,236
and then it spreads its fragrance
all around,

279
00:33:46,436 --> 00:33:51,170
so that, that mud also gets fragrance.

280
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:55,555
That's your job. That’s what you have
to be.

281
00:33:55,755 --> 00:33:59,891
Because you are not a seeker of truth
for yourself but for the whole world.

282
00:34:00,091 --> 00:34:03,194
Because you belong to Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

283
00:34:03,394 --> 00:34:09,277
This Mahalakshmi principle is not for you
alone, but it is for the whole world,

284
00:34:09,477 --> 00:34:14,221
and you have to give it to the whole world.
So now you are here

285
00:34:14,421 --> 00:34:19,623
forming a new kind of a race, a new kind
of a society,

286
00:34:19,823 --> 00:34:28,889
which is enlightened, which is standing
on the truth and love.

287
00:34:29,446 --> 00:34:35,859
Of course, you must understand that
there should be compassion.

288
00:34:36,059 --> 00:34:41,929
Look at that child, my God!

289
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:49,946
That’s another condition of the children
here. They must do something to get hurt.

290
00:34:50,146 --> 00:34:54,891
It’s very common. All the time, they do
things that will hurt them.

291
00:34:55,091 --> 00:34:58,676
They cannot sit quiet. It’s very surprising.

292
00:34:58,876 --> 00:35:02,985
In India you find children will sit quiet
for three hours - four hours,

293
00:35:03,185 --> 00:35:07,269
as long as the pujas are. Now here
the children are, I don't know

294
00:35:07,469 --> 00:35:11,297
but I am going to find out a solution
for this. They just cannot keep quiet.

295
00:35:11,497 --> 00:35:16,895
And now in America, they are suffering
from overactivity, is a disease,

296
00:35:17,095 --> 00:35:20,275
it is a disease now. They don't know what
to do with the overactive children.

297
00:35:20,475 --> 00:35:27,525
They are overactive. But I think I'll be
able to find out some solution for that.

298
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:32,900
But as far as you are concerned you are
your own solution.

299
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:42,324
You can watch yourself. You want to be people
who are spiritually very well equipped.

300
00:35:42,524 --> 00:35:47,170
For that equipment you must see yourself,
where are you,

301
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:53,991
what are you doing? What's your style
of life?

302
00:35:54,191 --> 00:35:58,461
A solid sahaja yogi or a yogini everyone
knows all over the world.

303
00:35:58,661 --> 00:36:03,219
They are solid. Nothing can deter them.

304
00:36:04,251 --> 00:36:08,416
And you can also know about yourself.
It’s not that you cannot know.

305
00:36:08,616 --> 00:36:15,599
All of you can know yourself very well
because now you are quite sensitive

306
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:20,225
and you have your own centers enlightened
by Mahalakshmi principle.

307
00:36:20,425 --> 00:36:26,795
The Kundalini has definitely enlightened
your Mahalakshmi principle.

308
00:36:26,995 --> 00:36:30,509
So you can always make out where are we,
what my chakras are,

309
00:36:30,709 --> 00:36:36,476
how are they catching, where are they
catching. Instead of avoiding that,

310
00:36:36,676 --> 00:36:41,548
you just work it out - what's the problem,
where is the problem?

311
00:36:41,748 --> 00:36:46,681
Once you work it out then you will be
surprised that,

312
00:36:46,881 --> 00:36:52,196
as soon as your desire goes inward,

313
00:36:52,396 --> 00:36:58,536
the Kundalini itself will rush through
and She will cleanse your chakras.

314
00:36:58,736 --> 00:37:01,978
As I was telling you, we do not know
our powers.

315
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:07,029
Only one thing you have to do is
to desire. You have to desire that,

316
00:37:07,229 --> 00:37:12,198
let my vibrations be all right,
let my chakras be cleared out,

317
00:37:12,398 --> 00:37:17,406
let me be in the center, in the balance.
Just you have to desire.

318
00:37:17,606 --> 00:37:23,059
I mean it’s such a simple thing to desire.
But that also we cannot do.

319
00:37:23,259 --> 00:37:27,422
Our desires are something else.
Not what we have to be.

320
00:37:27,622 --> 00:37:33,980
Just you have to desire that: let me be
a clean sahaja ogi.

321
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:37,937
Let me be a solid Sahaja Yogi.
There are mediocres

322
00:37:38,137 --> 00:37:42,264
who can never be. I am not talking
about them. But so many

323
00:37:42,464 --> 00:37:48,562
can be very high up, can be very high up
in Sahaja Yoga.

324
00:37:48,762 --> 00:37:53,678
But their desires are not yet being
fully manifested. .

325
00:37:53,878 --> 00:38:00,877
Then there is a damping effect of so many
things I have told you about.

326
00:38:01,077 --> 00:38:04,084
So supposing you have to catch the plane,

327
00:38:04,284 --> 00:38:08,205
then you don't get down on the way
somewhere and stay out.

328
00:38:08,405 --> 00:38:11,669
In the same way, when your Kundalini
has to rise,

329
00:38:11,869 --> 00:38:15,666
you can see everything that’s happening.
But keep yourself aloof,

330
00:38:15,866 --> 00:38:18,546
because you have to reach your point
and that is

331
00:38:18,746 --> 00:38:25,961
through this Mahalakshmi principle.
It is a principle that is so detached.

332
00:38:26,161 --> 00:38:29,578
It is the nourishing principle within us,

333
00:38:29,778 --> 00:38:34,005
which nourishes our centers, which
nourishes our character,

334
00:38:34,205 --> 00:38:39,075
which nourishes our religion, that is
Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

335
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:44,164
It nourishes everything. It nourishes
our brain, our intellect,

336
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:49,250
everything, it nourishes this Mahalakshmi
principle, above all

337
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:53,875
it is the balancing. It balances you.

338
00:38:54,075 --> 00:39:01,558
If you are overdoing something, then
it gives you a kind of a push.

339
00:39:01,758 --> 00:39:08,897
If you are not doing anything, again it
works in such a manner that it balances you.

340
00:39:09,593 --> 00:39:13,992
So this is the guiding factor for you,
this Mahalakshmi principle,

341
00:39:14,192 --> 00:39:18,825
which works out everything you can say

342
00:39:19,025 --> 00:39:25,680
that is balancing, the equilibrium
and the wisdom.

343
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:33,367
As the light of Mahalakshmi principle
starts, the wisdom dawns upon you.

344
00:39:33,567 --> 00:39:38,941
But the greatest of all is the love.
Love for God,

345
00:39:39,141 --> 00:39:46,640
love for truth and you thrive on that love.
Just you are there.

346
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,522
I mean, I asked him, "Why so many
are here?" They said,

347
00:39:49,722 --> 00:39:55,458
for the puja. Why? This is a sign that
you are great sahaja yogis,

348
00:39:55,658 --> 00:39:59,807
that you are here because of puja, that
you understand the value of puja

349
00:40:00,007 --> 00:40:04,721
and that you need the puja, that you enjoy
because it is nourishing to you.

350
00:40:04,921 --> 00:40:11,251
Is a very good thing because that shows
that you are very much there.

351
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:15,129
You are very much understanding
the importance of right things

352
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:19,246
and you want to do it at any cost.

353
00:40:19,446 --> 00:40:26,319
All these desires are significant because
they show that you are

354
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:31,660
in the Mahalakshmi principle and you want
to keep on that one.

355
00:40:32,848 --> 00:40:40,130
I would say, there is a simple one that
you can do is just to be on My Kundalini.

356
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:44,097
If you can, just try to be in My Kundalini

357
00:40:44,297 --> 00:40:46,923
- on My Kundalini. Just put attention.
You can, all of you can.

358
00:40:47,123 --> 00:40:51,510
Any problem, just put your attention onto
My Kundalini. And you will be all right.

359
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:57,319
You will just become thoughtless, because
there is no thought.

360
00:40:58,874 --> 00:41:03,048
This is the best way to do it, is to just
solve all problems

361
00:41:03,248 --> 00:41:09,751
by putting attention on My Kundalini and
by that your ego will definitely dissolve,

362
00:41:09,951 --> 00:41:12,656
because then you will know that Mother
is doing everything, I am doing nothing,

363
00:41:12,856 --> 00:41:16,608
so why should I be proud of it.

364
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:21,660
Also the conditionings will dissolve because

365
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:28,217
my Kundalini is absolutely pure. That’s -
It is not attached to anyone.

366
00:41:28,417 --> 00:41:33,391
It is not even attached to Sahaja Yoga.
It is not attached to anyone.

367
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:37,493
The job it has got to do is to nourish
everything.

368
00:41:37,693 --> 00:41:42,818
If it can nourish well and good. If it does
not nourish, well and good.

369
00:41:43,018 --> 00:41:47,081
It depends on what do you want. You want
to be nourished - all right,

370
00:41:47,281 --> 00:41:52,137
so the Kundalini is there, the Mahalakshmi
principle is there. It will nourish you.

371
00:41:52,337 --> 00:41:56,433
But if you don't want, nobody is going
to force you in any way.

372
00:41:56,633 --> 00:42:02,759
Nobody is going to jump on you or form
some sort of a formidable oppression.

373
00:42:02,959 --> 00:42:05,219
Nothing of the kind.

374
00:42:06,455 --> 00:42:10,312
It's just like a river Ganges, you can say,
which is flowing.

375
00:42:10,512 --> 00:42:15,101
Now if you want you can fill up your
pitchers.

376
00:42:15,301 --> 00:42:18,518
If you don't want, She is not going
to enter into your pitchers.

377
00:42:18,718 --> 00:42:22,938
She is not going to come in your house
and get into your pitchers.

378
00:42:23,138 --> 00:42:31,089
So there has to be a desire to get it and
that is what is called is 'Bhakti'.

379
00:42:31,289 --> 00:42:37,891
'Bhakti' is the desire, the devotion to get

380
00:42:40,914 --> 00:42:46,112
the joy of Bhakti. It's such a beautiful
thing.

381
00:42:46,312 --> 00:42:51,266
I wish, I could do the Bhakti to someone,
but I can't do.

382
00:42:51,466 --> 00:42:54,986
Because I see you, when you are in Bhakti,
you just get lost into it.

383
00:42:55,186 --> 00:42:59,010
So much you enjoy, such an enjoyable thing.

384
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:02,014
Then you don't think, you just enjoy
the Bhakti.

385
00:43:02,214 --> 00:43:10,775
And that’s what is the most coveted,
highest state

386
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:17,587
where you are just one with the divine
and just swimming in the ocean of joy.

387
00:43:17,787 --> 00:43:20,966
So this Mahalakshmi principle is to be
preserved

388
00:43:21,166 --> 00:43:25,526
and has to be always watched
and looked into.

389
00:43:25,726 --> 00:43:29,428
And the blessings of Mahalakshmi are
so many that,

390
00:43:29,628 --> 00:43:31,933
I tell you, I cannot even tell them

391
00:43:32,133 --> 00:43:34,626
in one lecture. I'll have to give at least
ten lectures.

392
00:43:34,826 --> 00:43:40,314
But you yourself know what are the blessings
of this Mahalakshmi principle is.

393
00:43:40,514 --> 00:43:44,801
The greatest is the complete
self-contentedness,

394
00:43:45,001 --> 00:43:48,285
is absolutely self-contented.

395
00:43:48,485 --> 00:43:55,038
You don't want to grab something, you
don't want to run after something,

396
00:43:55,238 --> 00:43:59,262
you are just self contended. You don't
want any publicity,

397
00:43:59,462 --> 00:44:07,243
you don't want any comfort, nothing.
You are comfortable in your spirit.

398
00:44:07,443 --> 00:44:13,089
This is the greatest blessing of this
Mahalakshmi principle,

399
00:44:13,289 --> 00:44:19,587
and if that is so, then why not we look
after our Mahalakshmi principle

400
00:44:19,787 --> 00:44:23,061
and forget about the rest.

401
00:44:23,261 --> 00:44:27,204
Last of all, when it enters into your brain,

402
00:44:27,404 --> 00:44:36,957
then the Virata is manifesting and you
become collective, absolutely collective.

403
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:40,475
It’s such a beautiful thing
is to be collective.

404
00:44:40,675 --> 00:44:43,313
There was a girl who went to Sicily

405
00:44:43,513 --> 00:44:46,694
and she was in a restaurant eating
something alone.

406
00:44:46,894 --> 00:44:52,003
And then she looked at somebody else
and that girl also looked at her.

407
00:44:52,203 --> 00:44:57,740
And this one got up and came to her and
she said... they were not wearing badges.

408
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:04,593
They said, 'Have you been to Shri Mataji -
Yes, Have you been - Yes.'

409
00:45:04,793 --> 00:45:10,081
'We are Sahaja Yogis - Yes.' And then they
just embraced each other with such joy.

410
00:45:10,281 --> 00:45:15,773
In a far-fetched place somewhere in Sicily,
in some restaurant, imagine!

411
00:45:15,973 --> 00:45:21,899
They just got lost. The feeling of fondness,
the brotherhood, the friendship

412
00:45:22,099 --> 00:45:27,759
is so great and so joyous. You don't then
consider from what country you are,

413
00:45:27,959 --> 00:45:30,790
from where do you come, what is
the color of your skin,

414
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:33,997
or what is the religion you had followed,

415
00:45:34,197 --> 00:45:40,840
what your parents are. You just enjoy
meeting people.

416
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:47,264
This friendship, this joy comes from
the same Mahalakshmi principle,

417
00:45:47,464 --> 00:45:52,003
when She enlightens your Sahastrara.

418
00:45:52,203 --> 00:45:56,525
In the Sahastrara you get this feeling
of the whole

419
00:45:56,725 --> 00:46:00,188
and the feeling of the whole is something
so great.

420
00:46:00,388 --> 00:46:04,200
Individualism, people talk, but it is
against the principle of whole.

421
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,628
Who do not know the whole you see
talk of individualism.

422
00:46:08,828 --> 00:46:14,492
This individualism which has worked
all kinds of dangers for us

423
00:46:14,692 --> 00:46:18,232
- now, we have to know that we are one
with the whole.

424
00:46:18,432 --> 00:46:25,950
Of course, we are individuals in the sense
that we have different, different faces,

425
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:30,050
different clothes, different living,
different relationships,

426
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:34,744
but we belong to the whole.

427
00:46:35,549 --> 00:46:40,644
And this Virata’s feeling that we are part
and parcel of the whole

428
00:46:40,844 --> 00:46:45,288
gives you complete peace and complete
protection.

429
00:46:45,488 --> 00:46:51,035
You never feel that something can happen
to you – never feel.

430
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:54,461
Some accident will take place, all right,
will take place,

431
00:46:54,661 --> 00:46:58,113
but nothing will happen to me.
I am a sahaja yogi.

432
00:46:58,927 --> 00:47:04,112
So many people have gained like this,
by allowing themselves

433
00:47:04,312 --> 00:47:09,650
to be completely looked after by this
Mahalakshmi principle.

434
00:47:09,850 --> 00:47:14,918
Just surrender to the Mahalakshmi principle
means that you give up your ego

435
00:47:15,118 --> 00:47:19,136
and you give up your conditionings.
You give up both the things.

436
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:21,782
Just surrendering to your Mahalakshmi
principle.

437
00:47:21,982 --> 00:47:26,118
That's why Mahalakshmi is so important.

438
00:47:27,137 --> 00:47:30,328
May God bless you all.
