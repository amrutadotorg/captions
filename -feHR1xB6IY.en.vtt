00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:55.220
Today, we are all here assembled

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.220
in Turkey, in Istanbul,

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.060
to celebrate the resurrection of Christ

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:11.700
and, with that also, your celebration of your resurrection.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.820
Christ's resurrection was a great message for us.

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.420
He won over the death

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:31.820
and came out of that dead body

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.220
with another body which was living body.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.940
The body was the same, but one was a dead body

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:48.180
and another one was a body which was living.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.380
It's not only symbolic, it actually happened within.

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:02.860
After all, He was a divine child, He was a divine person.

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:08.060
Actually it has happened within. It's not just a symbolic thing

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:15.580
that He died and He was resurrected into another person

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.060
or, you can say, into a living person.

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:31.820
For Him, what is the death? For eternal beings, there are no deaths.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:37.740
There's no death for a person who's eternal.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.980
He may, for the time being, look as if He is dead,

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.740
but He can never die.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:49.860
Christ was like that, a very, very special incarnation,

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:55.820
which came on this earth to be reborn out of the dead.

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:02.140
Now we are also, when we are not yet realized souls,

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.460
when we are not yet enlightened.

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:13.300
We are also dead in the sense, our awareness is very, very...

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:19.980
I should say, absolutely dull and dead.

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:25.980
We can see flowers, we can see faces, we can see buildings,

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:30.060
we can see cities, we can see all those things.

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.260
All these things we see and we feel we are quite aware,

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:37.020
which we are not.

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.900
Actual awareness comes to us

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.260
when we cross the limits of our mind,

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:47.900
go beyond the mind, and this was only possible

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:52.540
because of the resurrection of Christ.

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:57.140
He resurrected Himself because He was a divine person.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:05.460
But also we are resurrected because we are blessed by Divinity.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:10.940
Now this mind of ours, which is in between,

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:17.620
is controlled by Shri Jesus Christ.

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.660
He controls through your Agnya, both the sides.

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:26.460
He controls your conditionings and He controls your ego

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:30.260
and brings a balance in you.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:38.140
But when this Agnya Chakra starts sprinkling,

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:43.020
all sorts of ideas, sometimes reacting,

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:46.300
sometimes accepting conditionings...

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:50.420
it is a slave, it is not a free thing,

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:56.820
because it is working under the influence of your ego

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:00.060
or your superego.

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:07.140
For that is the death of our awareness,

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:13.820
that we cannot, we cannot understand something beyond.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:19.420
That there exists a life beyond this, we cannot accept.

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.900
This is... We have seen now

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:29.740
that we were all in a condition that one was deadened.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:33.380
We were feeling bad, we were feeling anxious,

00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:36.260
we were fighting and we were thinking:

00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:40.660
"There's something wrong with our present life."

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:46.380
There's something definitely which makes us slave,

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:49.140
by which we are slavish.

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:55.220
That we realized, no doubt, and we started seeking the Truth.

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:59.860
We started seeking the Truth in so many ways,

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:04.620
I know so many were... also went astray,

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:12.340
and they lost their balance and have fallen into a complete demise.

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:16.220
But so many of you have been salvaged,

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:23.540
have been saved by the great example of Christ's resurrection.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:26.220
He had to venture it,

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:30.100
He had to do it and He worked it out.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:35.340
Without Him, our Agnya would not have been that flexible.

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:37.900
As it is, the human beings

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:41.900
in the olden times were conditioned very much.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:46.340
And when they have become modern, they are full of ego,

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:48.180
nothing in between.

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:51.900
With these two influences, we are imprisoned,

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:57.180
we are absolutely dead people.

00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:00.500
We have no sensitivity for anything.

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:04.340
I've seen now... even today, you can see

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.860
about things are happening across,

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:12.100
is people are very anxious to kill each other.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.700
Human beings want to kill human beings, can you imagine?

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:22.100
Such a stupid thing that we should kill our kith and kin.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.540
Then, there are children who are killing,

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:30.740
parents that are killing, no relationship is accepted.

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:36.900
It's a sign of a person whose awareness is completely dead.

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:38.940
In our awareness, at least

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:43.420
we should have feelings of compassion and love.

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:48.900
But that one is lost, it's not there, we don't have it.

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:53.020
The whole world is a flame, when you read about

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.220
all the wars that are going on,

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:57.300
the way they are killing children,

00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:02.700
the way they are destroying human beings.

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:08.660
It is a wrong attitude

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:13.140
that with destruction of human beings, things will improve.

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:15.940
It's a very, very wrong concept

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:21.220
that by destroying them, one can achieve something.

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:27.820
Our work in Sahaja Yoga is doing well, I must say,

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:33.020
but it has to stop this horrible attitude of human beings

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:35.180
to destroy.

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.900
So you might ask then: "What to do, Mother?

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:42.460
What to do to stop this destruction?"

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.940
Answer is in the life of Christ.

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:47.020
You resurrect people,

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:51.460
you resurrect them, enlighten them, bring them

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:56.460
to a state where they understand what is right and what is wrong.

00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:00.980
Let them feel, let them feel the compassion

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:03.780
and love that is within you.

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:07.900
When that starts, that third force within us starts acting,

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:15.820
our ego also comes down,

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:18.860
our conditionings also come down.

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:21.620
For example, if you think: "We are Muslims,

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:25.020
we have a right to kill others", if you think:

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:28.180
"We are Jews, we have a right to kill others."

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:31.300
All these differentiations and

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:36.140
this kind of discrimination that we have is so stupid,

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:38.740
because you are human beings,

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:40.660
they are human beings.

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:46.060
You are killing human beings!

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:49.660
Not that they have committed any sin

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:51.740
or they have done anything wrong,

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:55.820
except that, in their foolishness, they believe that

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.980
they are this and they are that.

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:02.500
You are not! You are just human beings.

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:07.500
In every human being, as you know very well, there is Kundalini.

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:10.100
There's no discrimination, everyone,

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:15.180
whether you are a Muslim, a Jew, Hindu, Christian, Sikh, Parsee,

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:19.260
anyone, you may call by any name.

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:25.700
Now just look at how we accept a certain denomination for ourselves!

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:29.460
You are born, say, to a Christian family

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:32.740
or you are born to a Hindu family:

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:37.340
immediately you start thinking you are there to uphold

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:45.100
all the flags of that religion in which you are born.

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:49.020
You are born in that religion without your knowledge,

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:53.100
without your permission, without any understanding.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.540
So how can you belong to that religion?

00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:00.580
You have got Kundalini, everybody else has got Kundalini.

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:05.460
So you can only belong to the religion of humanity,

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:08.420
where every human being has got Kundalini.

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:10.660
So, you are nothing but human beings.

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:12.860
All these false ideas, that:

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:15.580
"We are Hindus, we are Muslims, we are Christians",

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:21.980
is all man-created. I mean, man can create anything,

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:25.700
and human beings have no brain to understand

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:27.780
that is all man creating.

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:31.460
For example, you see in America,

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:36.420
they create associations and big organizations and all that,

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:43.380
based on absolute falsehood, absolute wrong ideas,

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:47.660
absolute destructiveness, but they form it,

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:50.540
they form their groups, they have this, they have...

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:54.340
and they are prospering.

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:59.540
But it has a repercussion, they don't know.

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:04.340
If you start doing such false things against human beings

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:09.300
who are created by God, and nobody can destroy them,

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:11.900
then there are repercussions.

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:15.740
Many, many countries, who were, once upon a time, rulers,

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:20.020
were known as great things, have come down.

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:22.860
And all such countries who now think they are very rich

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:25.860
and all that, will have to come down.

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:30.220
All of them have to come down, is just an ultimate result

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:34.500
of this stupidity to believe that you are higher than others,

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:38.860
that you can kill others.

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:43.820
So, a non-violent method started

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:46.380
which is of another absurdity, I think,

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:54.140
because then they start saving mosquitoes and also the bugs,

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:57.100
while mosquitoes and bugs are,

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:02.620
you must know, are the greatest blood-suckers.

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:05.980
They live only on human blood.

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:10.220
Such things, what's the use of saving them?

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:17.780
So, human beings take to something that is absurd, stupid, foolish.

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:20.460
I don't know what is the reason.

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:25.180
The way they accept things is absolutely unbelievable.

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:29.020
I think it is a kind of a slavish mentality

00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:30.780
which does not give them freedom

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:33.140
to think what is right, what is wrong.

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:38.140
For this, we have Christ. We have Christ, a person

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:41.300
who was absolutely free,

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:45.660
free from all kinds of prejudices,

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:50.260
all kinds of temptations,

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:55.060
all kinds of nonsense that human beings follow.

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:59.060
But one may say that: "Mother, after all, He was divine!"

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:03.100
He was divine and now you are made divine also.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:11.700
So, how can we now join together to make a full effort,

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:16.580
a full effort, to tell people that:

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:22.340
"What are you doing? Why are you doing it?

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.140
What is the need to do such things?"

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:29.740
On one side is, we can say, a mass destruction

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:36.380
through stupidity, another side is your own self-destruction.

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:44.580
Take to drinking, take to other self-destructive things

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:47.500
which are immoral,

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:51.740
that's very easily available, and people like it very much.

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:57.140
They don't like when you talk that: "This is destructive."

00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:01.980
So, either we destroy others or destroy ourselves.

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:08.420
Christ was destroyed by others and He resurrected by Himself.

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:11.260
So we are also in the same position now.

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:14.500
I know many a times Sahaja Yoga was challenged.

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:17.140
Now it's much better, not so bad...

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:20.420
was challenged and there were so many problems.

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:24.460
But now it's smoothing down,

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:27.940
because that's the Truth, that's the Reality,

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:30.100
that's what is Divinity.

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:32.740
So, you should not be afraid.

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:39.420
All these funny ideas about Sahaja Yoga also will die out.

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:44.100
It's a resurrection, not only of you people,

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:48.820
but also of your ideologies.

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:51.100
Now the ideologies change,

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:55.380
that our awareness should be enlightened.

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:58.180
We should have light in our awareness.

00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:01.500
This has come suddenly through Sahaja Yoga to people, that:

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:03.620
"If you don't have the light,

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:09.140
how can you go further in the right path?"

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:14.100
It's not easy to describe Christ's life, how He went through that.

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:19.780
He died so young and brutally He was killed.

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:24.700
But still all that, He resurrected Himself.

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:28.940
He came out of all that, came out of that ordeal.

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:32.740
So for us also, when we are in Sahaja Yoga problems,

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:35.860
we should know we have a power to resurrect ourselves.

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:40.060
No one can destroy us! No one can finish us off,

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:44.340
because we have a power to resurrect ourselves.

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:47.620
This special power that we have to resurrect,

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:53.260
you should all the time understand and feel it and meditate on that.

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:56.660
I hear from people from every country:

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:58.260
"The government is doing like this,

00:19:58.420 --> 00:19:59.940
the government is doing like this!"

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:01.620
or they are having some trouble,

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:05.340
they call you a sect, they call you this and that...

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:07.740
Alright, doesn't matter!

00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:09.940
Your duty is to believe

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:14.260
that you are following the footsteps of Christ.

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:17.100
And no one can destroy it!

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:19.820
This is the message of Christ's life,

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:23.980
that divine life cannot be destroyed.

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:27.220
When this body could not be destroyed,

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:31.540
then how can you destroy the divine light in Him?

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.700
So many Sahaja Yogis are here,

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:36.980
who have been since long in Sahaja Yoga,

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:38.940
and they have had problems,

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:42.060
and they went through lot of troubles, I agree!

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:45.100
But all these things have subsided.

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:48.380
And now you are in such a resurrected position

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:51.260
that, after some time, -you'll be amazed-

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:56.460
Sahaja Yoga will take over, all over the world.

00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:59.700
All over the world, people will take to Sahaja Yoga

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:03.820
and we'll have such a lot of Sahaja Yogis all over the world

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:09.940
that all this minority of some stupid people will disappear.

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:13.980
For that, what have you to do? Sometimes, people ask Me:

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:18.260
"What do we have to do?" You must have also read the Bible,

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:23.060
that Christ prayed and He was praying.

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:27.020
In the same way, we can say, we have to meditate.

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:30.140
Through meditation, we'll grow in our awareness,

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:36.980
in our new personality, in our strengthened personality.

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:40.220
Meditation is the only way we can grow,

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:43.540
and then no one can destroy you,

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:47.180
because you are all protected by the Divine Love.

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:48.500
You don't have to worry

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:51.380
as to who will destroy you, what will happen.

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:54.540
Of course, in the beginning there's little agitation,

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:57.420
people feel a little bad about it, it's alright!

00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:01.660
But actually, NO ONE can destroy you.

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:03.740
Have this faith in you!

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:06.260
Christ had no organization;

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:10.980
He had no Adi Shakti to support Him, in no way.

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:15.420
But only through His divine personality,

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:18.500
He managed to get out of all the problems,

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:24.300
of all the tortures, of all the atrocities on Him.

00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:27.140
So now, you have better advantage,

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:29.060
because you are enlightened.

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:34.020
Firstly, He was a divine person and He could go through that.

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:35.860
You don't have to!

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:38.100
Nobody will torture you, nobody will put you in jail,

00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:40.060
nobody will crucify you.

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:42.700
Nobody will, that's not possible.

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:47.780
But mentally, if you are upset, sometimes you get upset I know,

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:50.380
in certain countries people get upset,

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:53.700
because they think they are oppressed because they are in Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:58.540
I assure you, no one can do that.

00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:04.060
You must know that you are all the time protected.

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:09.740
Christ is there as your elder brother, I always said that.

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:12.260
But also you have your Mother,

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:16.460
and you have all the Ganas and all the Angels around you.

00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:19.900
When I see this, I just thought: "Look at this,

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:26.340
in every country they have shown Angels and Ganas are there!"

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:30.180
Such pure forms of protection you have.

00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:33.380
So there's nothing to worry about

00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:37.740
your destruction or your impediments,

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:39.580
or whatever you may call it,

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:45.580
a kind of destructive forces acting on you.

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:51.580
From the life of Christ, you have to know that no one can destroy

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:55.260
a realised soul in these modern times.

00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:57.340
As it is, they never destroyed.

00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:01.780
We had so many Saints who were killed, who were tortured,

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:06.220
but see, they still exist as poetry, as poems,

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:14.660
also as blessings, everywhere they are not finished.

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:18.300
They are not dead, though it seems that they are no more,

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:25.980
but even to take their names and even to call them, they work out.

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:30.100
They are there in their Spirit and they help.

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:33.540
Assured by Christ's life,

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:38.780
by His resurrection, we are resurrected people.

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:42.500
Of course, our body also has changed.

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:46.860
After resurrection, you know that your Chakras work out

00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:50.700
all the curing and all the blessings.

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:54.420
Our attitude, our mental attitude also changes,

00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:57.540
and also your ego subsides.

00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:00.900
Not only that, also our conditionings go out.

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:05.300
Specially I was so happy that those people, say,

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:07.660
who are born in a particular religion,

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:11.180
immediately they see what's wrong with that religion,

00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:16.540
as if they turn round and see the image of their society

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:18.460
and know what's wrong with them.

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:24.340
And when they start meditating on those corrections,

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:28.220
it works, societies are improving.

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:33.220
You see, so-called religious ideas are falling into their own traps,

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:36.500
and they will all fall because they're falsehood.

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:38.220
That's not real religion.

00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:42.740
The religion is within ourselves and this pure religion

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:46.380
is the one which is a global religion.

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:52.020
The solution comes like that: supposing you have wars...

00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:59.060
wars in the name of religion,

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:01.700
in the name of God specially.

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:06.020
And in the name of religions they have wars.

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:08.500
So now, what happens?

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:15.940
All these wars that take place cannot destroy Reality,

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:18.140
cannot destroy the Truth.

00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:21.620
This is another message of Christ's resurrection.

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:23.140
You cannot!

00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:26.540
You may think that today you have destroyed these people,

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:29.500
but they are there.

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:34.500
All the Saints, all the great people

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:41.380
who have been resurrected in life are all the time there.

00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:44.940
Their protections are there, their guidance is there,

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:51.100
you can see them in a way that they are there.

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:59.060
So one should have no fear. The fear of death has to go.

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:01.460
So many of them have said the same

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:03.460
that: "What is death after all?"

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:08.260
Death dies itself, once you are resurrected.

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:11.180
So one should not be afraid of death.

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:14.900
Now how many of you have been afraid of death

00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:18.500
before your resurrection, but not now?

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:22.220
You are not bothered as to when the death comes, what happens

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:26.940
or which way you are going to be so-called destroyed.

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:29.180
You know you cannot be destroyed.

00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:32.460
In your heart of hearts, you all know this very well,

00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:36.140
that you cannot be destroyed.

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:45.060
The fear of our destruction goes away, no doubt.

00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:49.260
But there is one thing, is the compassion.

00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:51.580
When you see all these bad things are happening

00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:57.420
and people are being tortured, your mind is... you see...

00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:59.820
cannot take it for granted.

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:04.580
It starts responding to that,

00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:10.220
and it feels the pain of others, tremendous!

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:15.020
But as a result of that, your will power,

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:19.900
your thinking on those lines, your tears even are powerful

00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:23.140
and they can bring solace to those people

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:25.580
who are suffering unnecessarily.

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:30.460
You have to experiment with it.

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:41.340
Just having a feeling of compassion and love, things will improve.

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:45.660
Now, as it is, we meditate.

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:51.140
But we can meditate also with such compassion

00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:57.740
and such love that your tears can also have an effect

00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:00.300
on these people who are so cruel

00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:04.300
and stupid and killing each other.

00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:09.420
But it is important for you to know that now

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:12.980
you are not an individual, but you have become a global personality,

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:15.380
a global personality.

00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:19.780
You are not an individual, you are a global personality,

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:26.140
and sitting down here, you are working out all the global problems.

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:29.060
You are not a small person now,

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:31.260
who's only worried about your own children,

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:34.780
about your family, about this and that, no!

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:39.620
This mind of yours has expanded, expanded like this,

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:46.260
that it works automatically for all the problems of the world.

00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:49.100
When for a woman I read newspapers,

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:51.980
specially women seldom read newspapers,

00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:54.620
they think it's stupidity to read those papers.

00:29:54.780 --> 00:30:00.540
But I read, I read and I read those where My attention is in it.

00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:05.220
I've seen it works! But all of you put together, if you understand

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:08.620
that this is your responsibility to correct

00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:14.900
all the destructive forces, to put them right,

00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:19.260
we just have to collectively meditate on the points

00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:23.220
where you find there's a big problem.

00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:28.020
Now the problem mainly is because of religions, mainly.

00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:31.580
Now, if they can all jump into the new religion,

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:36.020
global religion, they all are one.

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:39.580
They cannot then fight because there's one religion.

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:41.780
But they don't want to have one religion,

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:44.620
because they want to fight. They're fighting cocks.

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:49.900
But if they come to Sahaj, if they become enlightened,

00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:53.740
then they will only enjoy love of each other

00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:58.700
and not killing of each other, destruction of others.

00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:03.060
And this is what we have to learn from life of Christ,

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:04.980
who was alone, who was single.

00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:07.500
He did not have such a collective behind Him.

00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:11.940
But how powerful He was that He fought the death

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:16.820
and came out of it so clearly at the stage of Agnya!

00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:20.340
Without Him, we could not have worked out Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:22.780
Kundalini would not have gone through,

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:25.500
unless and until He had sacrificed His life.

00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:27.500
And He readily sacrificed,

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:32.540
He accepted the task of sacrificing His life,

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:34.620
and then resurrected.

00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:37.740
He passed through that, I should say,

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:41.300
a very constricted channel of Agnya,

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:48.740
to put you people right, by saying: "You forgive everyone."

00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:51.580
If forgiving was such a powerful thing

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:55.700
that you can even fight your death, then why not forgive?

00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:58.260
Many people say: "Mother, we can't forgive!"

00:31:58.420 --> 00:31:59.940
and I've told hundred times that:

00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:03.460
"What are you doing if not forgiving?"

00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:07.300
So, the message of Christ's life is that He forgot,

00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:10.380
forgave all the people who troubled Him.

00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:13.820
Even He said that: "O God, please forgive them,

00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:17.500
because they don't know what they are doing!"

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:22.620
On the cross, He said those things, when He was tortured, insulted,

00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:25.340
He's saying what? "You forgive them,

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:28.620
have pity, have sympathy for them,

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:31.980
because they don't know what they are doing!" They are killing

00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:34.940
the Son of God, and what will happen to them?

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:39.580
Where will they go? What will be their situation?

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:47.580
This one is a big message for us,

00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:51.620
that even on the cross, He said: "Forgive,

00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:55.540
O God, O Father, forgive them!"

00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:59.620
In the same way, we have to also forgive people.

00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:05.500
It's very important from the life of Christ that we have to forgive.

00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:11.300
His forgiveness was of the greatest importance.

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:14.460
For the whole world to understand, you must forgive.

00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:17.460
If you learn how to forgive, you'll be amazed,

00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:20.940
half of the wars of this world will be finished!

00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:24.220
Now, something happened thousands of years back.

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:28.500
Still people are fighting, still they are fighting,

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:31.260
thinking these things happened so many years back,

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:34.060
so they are our ennemies.

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:38.740
If He can really forgive those people,

00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:44.020
what happened before we were even born,

00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:49.540
why should we form a group of such people, why?

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:54.860
Because there is something called hatred in human beings,

00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:59.660
they have hatred, hatred for this, hatred for that,

00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:03.980
even in small things they'll say: "I don't like it, I like it!"

00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:06.540
It's very common,

00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:13.220
nowadays specially.

00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:16.180
When we were young, we were not supposed to say such a thing:

00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:19.660
"I don't like it, I like it!",

00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:21.580
we were not supposed to say.

00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:25.500
But now their freedom has given them to talk like this:

00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:28.020
"I don't like it, I don't like that,

00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:33.540
I don't like that, I don't like that person!" Who are you?

00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:37.820
What do you think of yourself to judge others?

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:39.940
You don't know how to appreciate,

00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:41.940
you don't know how to enjoy

00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:44.700
and only what you go on is: "I don't like it!"

00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:47.620
And supposing you like it, what will you do?

00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:52.140
Whether you like it or don't like is just the same!

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:55.180
But just to show off their ego, we say:

00:34:55.340 --> 00:35:00.580
"I don't like this way, I don't like!"

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:04.540
Because there's no love!

00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:10.780
If there is love, then you can enjoy everything.

00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:14.660
We'll never say: "I don't like it, I like it!"

00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:21.540
You will definitely enjoy if you really say

00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:25.540
that: "I enjoy, I enjoy everything!"

00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:28.380
You are closing down yourself by saying:

00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:32.740
"I don't like it, I don't like it, I don't like!"

00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:34.940
as if you are a great connoisseur,

00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:39.900
or a person, a judge, to say this!

00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:45.260
It is very remarkable that in the West it's even more prominent

00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:48.940
that they will say: "I don't like it, I don't like!"

00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:52.060
Of course, in the East, I would say in India,

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:54.220
if somebody says like that, people will say

00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:57.540
he's just trying to show off. On the face!

00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:04.900
But showing off is not regarded as bad manners.

00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:07.900
It's not regarded as bad manners in the West.

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:12.540
To feel shy of anything is regarded as bad manners,

00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:19.900
but to boast of something, nobody feels that it is a bad thing.

00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:23.860
Did Christ boast of anything? Never!

00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:27.180
He never boasted of anything,

00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:35.260
but when He saw people were selling things in the holy places,

00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:37.020
what did He do?

00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:40.380
He started beating them with a hunter,

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:43.380
because that was wrong, absolutely wrong,

00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:47.660
against the holiness of the place.

00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:50.300
But He did not say: "I don't like it!" No!

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:56.460
He just showed His complete disapproval

00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:59.820
of the whole system of selling things

00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:04.860
in the temple or in a holy place.

00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:07.700
People go there to worship.

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:14.500
They need a mind which is devoid of money orientation.

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:23.900
There should be no money orientation when you are meditating.

00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:27.460
This is the biggest problem of today.

00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:31.020
Everything is money orientation.

00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:37.220
You like a car which is very expensive, so you want to have.

00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:40.700
By hook and crook, you will get that car and sit in there.

00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:48.100
You might be a thief, but you buy an expensive car to show off,

00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:52.460
perhaps maybe because you are a thief, that's why you want to hide

00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:54.740
your personality.

00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:59.740
So there is no truthful life, it's all just showing off

00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:02.060
and thinking no end of yourself.

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:08.220
But when the death will come at your doorstep, what will you do?

00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:13.700
At that time, you will be trembling

00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:17.180
with all your so-called achievements

00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:19.100
and your so-called showing off.

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:23.060
You will just tremble before death.

00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:26.580
But a Sahaja Yogi cannot!

00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:31.660
He will like, if the death has to come, it has to come!

00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:37.420
He will not tremble that the death is something dangerous,

00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:40.740
but is a place where he can go and rest.

00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:44.180
He won't mind, he won't mind anything,

00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:49.580
because he is above that, he is above destruction.

00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:52.980
So, he won't mind anything, whatever comes his way

00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:57.700
and he will surrender to it easily.

00:38:57.860 --> 00:39:01.540
We have Kabir. Kabir has written so many poems,

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:06.660
mostly about death.

00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:11.660
He said: "When death came, I didn't say a single word,

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:15.100
I didn't fight, but what I did,

00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:21.620
I took a sheet on top of me and went off to sleep!"

00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:24.660
How sweetly he described death sometimes,

00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:28.700
and Kabir then reminds Me of Christ.

00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:34.060
How sweetly Christ also went through all these things,

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:42.380
and when He died, the whole elements shook.

00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:45.300
He was the master of elements.

00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:46.700
They shook,

00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:51.180
there was earthquake and all kinds of things that happened.

00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:55.900
They, they felt His death, not Him!

00:39:56.060 --> 00:40:00.220
They felt that such a great divinity

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:08.940
which is the essence of existence has been killed like this.

00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:12.980
They also didn't know that He is going to come back to His life.

00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:16.100
They also were not aware of it, but He did.

00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:21.260
He did come out of that deadening thing, for which

00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:25.780
everybody was so much shocked.

00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:32.100
His death itself gives us strength,

00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:36.060
that we have no death, we have resurrected

00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:40.460
and resurrection is with us.

00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:42.460
But we have to establish,

00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:47.580
we have to establish our Sahaja Yoga, our meditation.

00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:49.420
That's very important.

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:52.220
The other day, I met a lady.

00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:57.500
She told of a miracle in her life, how she was saved.

00:40:57.660 --> 00:41:03.140
She was about to die, she came across an accident, all kind...

00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:07.580
But how she was saved, while her husband,

00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:10.980
he succumbs to all kinds of things. So I said:

00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:13.580
"What do you mean, how it happened?" She said:

00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:17.260
"Mother, it's nothing but Shraddha!"

00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:22.380
Shraddha is dedication, surrendering.

00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:27.700
"Surrendering, because I'm surrendered!"

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:32.140
But I said: "How?" "That, I don't know, I'm just surrendered.

00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:38.500
I feel so comfortable, so lively and so much out of fear

00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:40.860
when I know I'm surrendered,

00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:43.980
completely surrendered to my Spirit!"

00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:46.540
And this what it is what we have to learn

00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:49.980
when we meditate, that we have to surrender.

00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:53.660
Muhammad has called "Islam". Islam means surrender,

00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:56.820
though they don't surrender -otherwise you see...-

00:41:56.980 --> 00:42:00.700
but what is that you must surrender

00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:05.900
to your global nature, to your higher nature.

00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:09.460
You must not die out,

00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:11.700
you must not fizzle out

00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:16.980
into these worldly turmoil and worldly things.

00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:22.820
It's a very strength-giving example of Christ.

00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:27.940
And He's with us, He will always guide us, He'll look after us,

00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:30.980
not only but He'll give us strength.

00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:37.100
He will destroy all those who will be against eternal life.

00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:39.300
He'll destroy nonsensical things.

00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:44.380
And you are seeing now how in Kali Yuga all these institutions

00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:49.220
who talk of religion and fights are getting destroyed.

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:52.060
Automatically, we have done nothing.

00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:56.540
On their own only, while they're doing, they are finishing,

00:42:56.700 --> 00:43:00.980
because there's no Reality, there's no Spirit in it,

00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:07.020
and without the Spirit, what is left is nothing but a dead body.

00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:12.220
The whole understanding should be for Sahaja Yogis,

00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:16.620
that we have to be Spirit-oriented,

00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:22.540
not money-oriented, body-oriented, emotion-oriented,

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:24.740
but Spirit-oriented,

00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:27.180
which is a joy-giving thing.

00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:30.940
And you'll be surprised with that orientation,

00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:39.380
you will be the most happy, most loving,

00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:43.860
most beautiful person.

00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:46.260
Immediately, people will know around

00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:49.420
that there's something about this man, some spark

00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:55.900
about this lady, some sort of a spark that she is or he is

00:43:56.060 --> 00:44:02.180
so much different from us. It can be recognized in no time.

00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:08.460
Now, at the time of Christ, very few people could recognize,

00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:11.820
because they were not enlightened,

00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:19.100
because they were very much below the level of human beings,

00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:21.980
I should say. But you are not!

00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:26.140
You are quite aware, you are born in modern times,

00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:29.060
and at this time, when we think of Christ,

00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:31.580
we should know what a life it was,

00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:35.060
what a grand personality it was,

00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:38.820
that He subjected to this kind of a torture.

00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:41.580
He could have destroyed all of them in no time.

00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:45.580
He was so powerful, such a powerful personality,

00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:49.980
but He did not! He forgave them.

00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:52.820
He gave you the message of forgiveness,

00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:55.740
the greatest force that can work out.

00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:58.260
Now also, you should surrender yourself

00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:03.580
to this idea of forgiveness and really try to forgive.

00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:07.420
You'll be amazed, you will feel very much peaceful, very happy,

00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:12.500
and the person who has tortured you will come round.

00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:17.740
What we have to do is now to transform people. That's our job.

00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:20.500
We have to transform them. We are transformed.

00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:23.540
We are at a point, we can call it, we are resurrected.

00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:26.980
We have to resurrect the whole world, that's our job,

00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:30.500
so that all these fights, all these quarrels,

00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:35.020
all these falsehoods will just be finished.

00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:38.900
For us, Christ is our leader, who has done this for us.

00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:40.820
He came as an ordinary human being,

00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:42.900
lived like an ordinary human being,

00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:45.460
with all these powers within Him.

00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:47.900
He never used them to destroy.

00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:52.820
In the same way, we can also with love and affection,

00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:57.780
we can also really come out of our deaths,

00:45:57.940 --> 00:46:00.180
come out of our misgivings,

00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:03.660
come out of our destructive nature.

00:46:03.820 --> 00:46:10.180
This destructive nature is the most dangerous thing for Yogis.

00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:16.900
That's the only hope we have, that Sahaja Yogis are resurrected.

00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:21.380
Only thing I know is that,

00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:26.340
if we have so many Sahaja Yogis, this world will change.

00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:28.180
This world has to change.

00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:30.660
But your progress should go on,

00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:35.460
you should progress more and more, not you should not regress back.

00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:38.340
For small things here and there, don't worry!

00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:41.260
You have a very great responsibility,

00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:46.740
and that responsibility is to transform the human beings.

00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:51.820
That's your due. How many have you transformed?

00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:57.180
How many have you changed? It's all right for men or women.

00:46:57.340 --> 00:47:00.500
You have to change people, this is your job

00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:04.180
and this is the power you have got from Christ,

00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:07.500
that you have to change them, transform them

00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:11.060
into the new world of happiness and joy

00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:17.500
which we call it as the Sahaj Nirmal Dharma.

00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:21.340
If it works out, if it really works out,

00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:26.220
think of the world, how beautiful it will become for us!

00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:28.980
It's the duty of every Sahaja Yogi

00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:34.260
to go into this kind of a new venture

00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:39.500
and try to find out how many people he can convert

00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:42.580
and how many people he can bring round.

00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:46.500
I hope next time we'll have doubled the number of people

00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:50.820
that are here from all these eight countries who are hosting now.

00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:53.300
All My love to you all.

00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:57.940
Great days are waiting us.

00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:03.820
We have to now understand only our responsibility.

00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:07.500
Main thing is how many people we have converted,

00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:10.020
how many people we have resurrected.

00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:12.820
That is the record, not what,

00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:15.220
how many Pujas you have attended and all that.

00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:16.660
It's not so important.

00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:20.300
Pujas are just to give you strength and to give you power,

00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:24.500
but they are not your work. That's not your work.

00:48:24.660 --> 00:48:27.020
For your work, you can take from Pujas

00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:28.900
all the strength that you need.

00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:34.420
But if you don't use this power, then what's the use?

00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:37.540
So now, I leave it to you to remember

00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:41.460
that you are resurrected and you have to resurrect others.

00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:43.900
It's a very, very important job

00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:48.580
at this time of complete turmoil and destruction.

00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:51.420
May God bless you!
