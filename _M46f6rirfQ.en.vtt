WEBVTT

01:05.886 --> 01:11.139
I see many more New Zealanders, very happy to see all of you here.

01:27.185 --> 01:31.304
Today I thought we should have Mahasaraswati's Puja.

01:31.364 --> 01:33.074
Would be a good idea,

01:33.354 --> 01:37.143
Because we did Mahalakshmi, let's have Mahasaraswati.

01:42.896 --> 01:50.257
So, Mahasaraswati Principle is on the right side as you all know.

01:50.833 --> 01:55.357
First is the Brahmadeva's Principle,

01:55.508 --> 02:00.941
which is the Saraswati Principle, and then

02:01.664 --> 02:04.991
this Mahasaraswati takes you

02:06.721 --> 02:15.210
to the principle of Mahabrahmadeva  called as Hiranyagarbha.

02:16.723 --> 02:23.515
Now this Hiranyagarbha Principle is very important for Sahaja Yogis.

02:25.150 --> 02:30.372
First of all, those who think too much

02:31.591 --> 02:36.034
or those who create too much without realization,

02:36.879 --> 02:41.717
those who express themselves in poetry

02:41.908 --> 02:50.891
or in literature or in music, you can say,

02:51.753 --> 02:56.542
in paintings, in all kinds of arts;

02:57.225 --> 02:59.784
if they are not realized souls,

03:00.385 --> 03:05.068
then they go to the left to the extreme or to the right.

03:05.568 --> 03:13.813
So for example if there is an artist, if he goes to the right

03:14.416 --> 03:23.313
gradually his paintings will become extremely violent expressions.

03:24.365 --> 03:32.031
Would be very much showing something very violent

03:33.896 --> 03:44.472
and also rather, I would say he would be a man
who would be inflexible.

03:44.845 --> 03:48.224
He'll have his own style; he can't move into another style.

03:48.280 --> 03:53.918
He'll use the same style and he will not get into any other style.

03:54.339 --> 04:04.811
Kind of a austere nature he develops in his productions

04:05.516 --> 04:11.295
and then when he gets tired of it, then he will take to something

04:11.391 --> 04:15.648
you can say like abstract art

04:15.847 --> 04:23.401
but without realization the abstract art
can be something very absurd and funny.

04:24.131 --> 04:29.235
I have seen the extremes of it that I've seen people

04:29.506 --> 04:37.792
who put big canvases on the ground and poured lots of oil paints

04:38.101 --> 04:43.383
one after another and roll over it, is supposed to be a painting.

04:43.687 --> 04:45.914
They say this is spontaneous

04:46.017 --> 04:51.662
because they fell on it or they rolled on that
so is spontaneous painting that's come out.

04:52.249 --> 04:58.034
Now this spontaneous painting should come
from a spontaneous personality

04:58.210 --> 05:02.253
not by rolling on thing or something,
I mean, all sorts of things they do

05:02.473 --> 05:07.367
but there's no end to it to which nonsensical things they think of.

05:07.726 --> 05:10.191
And they think they have achieved a lot and they've done a lot

05:10.231 --> 05:14.746
and also they sell it to people who have too much of right side.

05:14.992 --> 05:18.950
They like it. So...

05:21.982 --> 05:29.044
they put in lot of effort to create this kind of a painting.

05:30.250 --> 05:35.882
Also that today's pop music also,
which is very aggressive, is from the same

05:36.069 --> 05:41.302
outcome because you cannot ascend, so you move to your right.

05:41.749 --> 05:46.111
And this pop music then starts now it's becoming so horribly noisy,

05:46.191 --> 05:52.703
I don't know what to call it. Absolutely it can deafen your ears

05:52.822 --> 05:56.552
if you listen to it and the whole thing is,

05:56.658 --> 06:00.808
the whole gestures and all that are so ugly and so aggressive

06:00.970 --> 06:07.606
as if they're going to eat the mike sometimes
I feel the way go on with the mike and things.

06:07.891 --> 06:12.593
And see then these people also impress such people

06:12.633 --> 06:16.456
who are very right-sided and so they become popular.

06:16.559 --> 06:21.715
But the popularity is not the sign of real success.

06:21.837 --> 06:24.001
It will come and go away.

06:24.089 --> 06:29.416
All such artists and painters come and go away they have no,

06:29.687 --> 06:34.149
no standing, they are there for a short time.

06:34.582 --> 06:39.818
And then the history talks about them
those who have been in the center54

06:39.905 --> 06:42.760
never about the people who went to the extremes.

06:42.760 --> 06:44.943
God knows how many must have come and gone.

06:45.031 --> 06:49.971
And those who are today also painting or singing
in that way tomorrow they will not be known.

06:50.128 --> 06:53.012
One after another you see the craze comes in one comes

06:53.043 --> 06:56.082
and goes away another so they are crazy people

06:56.193 --> 07:00.590
and they create a craze and the crazy like them enjoy the craze.

07:00.718 --> 07:05.068
So it amounts to something that is just wasteful

07:05.279 --> 07:08.655
creates no impression in the history.

07:09.425 --> 07:14.476
So this is the right-sided nonsense that
comes out of the right side movement

07:14.657 --> 07:21.259
of the sympathetic going too far with your creativity

07:21.652 --> 07:24.323
and also your writing.

07:25.196 --> 07:29.946
And there were many writers in English language
you know from Shakespeare you can start

07:30.097 --> 07:36.856
who showed the futility of human endeavour
like we call an avadhuta,

07:36.997 --> 07:44.198
the one who has reached a very great degree
of development in his spiritual life.

07:44.375 --> 07:47.258
He can see the futility of human endeavour

07:47.329 --> 07:53.229
and then he brings them to the point that they have to rise

07:53.363 --> 07:58.467
above these stupid and human endeavours
and take to some sort of an endeavour,

07:58.603 --> 08:01.307
which will bring them something higher

08:01.395 --> 08:05.133
and also will create something of an eternal value.

08:05.341 --> 08:09.623
Then also we have, I think in English language I have said,

08:09.748 --> 08:12.055
[INAUDIBLE] to Somerset Maugham and all that.

08:12.191 --> 08:15.357
They're very centrally placed people,

08:15.480 --> 08:19.355
also Cronin was I would say, but then this Hemmingway came,

08:19.458 --> 08:22.517
and he started moving towards the right. Now I don't know

08:22.629 --> 08:26.108
I don't read now modern novels because all full of filth.

08:26.244 --> 08:28.102
So it moves to the right.

08:28.208 --> 08:34.291
So one is which moves to the right
and talks about all kinds of violence this that,

08:34.541 --> 08:40.124
that also is absolutely not palatable
to human consumption I tell you.

08:40.323 --> 08:42.993
But still they write and people like it.

08:43.168 --> 08:44.978
People want to read about Hitler,

08:45.003 --> 08:49.585
they want to read how people were killed, war stories this that.

08:49.592 --> 08:54.520
They want to see pictures which has full of violence,
who are killing this and that,

08:54.583 --> 09:00.610
so that their own desire to be
violent is satisfied in seeing those things

09:00.769 --> 09:07.769
in films and in, otherwise also reading such books of that kind.

09:08.213 --> 09:12.355
On the left hand side when they move you see these artists

09:12.467 --> 09:14.564
then same about musicians as I said

09:14.651 --> 09:19.698
that the musicians become sort of a absolutely

09:19.841 --> 09:23.494
suffering from Greek tragedy all the time.

09:23.685 --> 09:31.127
They go on crying and weeping and saying that this is sort of,

09:31.326 --> 09:36.206
we have been very sad and this sadness and the tragedy of life,

09:36.310 --> 09:39.121
I mean they go on crying and make you cry also.

09:39.341 --> 09:47.444
So there's no hope for them and
they just go on doing such stupid things.

09:47.961 --> 09:54.256
Then we have you see many artists also of the same kind

09:54.463 --> 09:58.467
specially French. French writers as well as

09:58.618 --> 10:02.194
French poets also and French painters if you see.

10:02.226 --> 10:04.916
They are very left sided because they drink a lot.

10:04.987 --> 10:10.901
If you go in any France village after seven o'clock
you can't find even one person on the road

10:11.091 --> 10:14.549
and even if you want to find out the road and you knock at the door

10:14.628 --> 10:17.339
and request them that you would like to know

10:17.467 --> 10:21.159
some road and all that, they're all drunk already at seven o'clock.

10:21.317 --> 10:26.291
So with this thing they become extremely over-romantic type and

10:26.490 --> 10:29.509
they sing songs of romance, have no romance in their life you see,

10:29.573 --> 10:33.680
they just, some sort of a imaginary romance they have

10:33.792 --> 10:38.430
and they live in that imaginary world of pain and sufferings

10:38.494 --> 10:44.715
and they have their own ideas about their own romantic models

10:44.740 --> 10:48.640
that they formed in their heads you see with their left side.

10:48.764 --> 10:52.279
So the poets and the writers go to the left side like that

10:52.425 --> 10:56.401
and in say for example in our India we had those

10:56.472 --> 11:01.828
Muslims used to drink a lot then
they started a thing called as gazal 113

11:01.930 --> 11:05.762
and that gazal is nothing but crying. Even in certain poets you see,

11:05.855 --> 11:09.204
we have this kind of a thing in the other places

11:09.276 --> 11:12.632
where there were many poets who were seeking God and were crying,

11:12.696 --> 11:17.528
"Oh God, when will I meet?" and in separation they are singing,

11:17.816 --> 11:23.807
not in the meeting, not in the yoga
but in separation they sing,

11:23.958 --> 11:25.872
'When will I meet You, oh God?" and all that.

11:25.897 --> 11:30.126
And all such people who are still seeking like such songs going on.

11:30.329 --> 11:31.531
Up to this much is all right

11:31.556 --> 11:35.539
but then you get lots of grotesque type of writers also

11:35.564 --> 11:37.774
who write such horrible things

11:37.799 --> 11:41.576
that you feel you are in hell the way
they describe things are horrible.

11:41.664 --> 11:45.225
And in Sanskrit called as bibhatsa (बीभत्स)create a bibhatsa-ras (बीभत्स रस).

11:45.326 --> 11:49.062
And it's the description of very filthy things

11:49.166 --> 11:52.456
which were never before even in English language.

11:52.528 --> 12:00.506
Never I saw that but now some books are full of filth and dirt

12:00.554 --> 12:06.586
and horrible sex descriptions that you just can't bear it.

12:06.729 --> 12:09.459
So all this comes with the left side movement that,

12:09.523 --> 12:14.591
because you see society also  moves from

12:14.678 --> 12:17.655
sometimes to the right sometimes to the left.

12:17.726 --> 12:20.669
So when it moves to the right they like right-sided things

12:20.717 --> 12:23.495
sometimes they move to the left they like left-sided things.

12:23.591 --> 12:26.626
So also there are people with two types of temperaments

12:26.689 --> 12:30.579
so that's how they start appreciating these things and

12:30.660 --> 12:33.500
unnecessarily they believe that they are tragic.

12:33.729 --> 12:37.041
As you know about the Greek tragedy

12:37.081 --> 12:42.195
which is a very sort of a fundamental thing
I would say for a Western

12:42.393 --> 12:44.949
Western literature is a Greek tragedy

12:45.116 --> 12:49.887
where a woman marries a man but she doesn't love her husband

12:50.070 --> 12:52.296
so she loves somebody else and that tragedy is there.

12:52.305 --> 12:55.624
I mean it's artificially created tragedy

12:55.696 --> 13:00.469
that shows that you are married to some man
and you should be happy with him.

13:00.564 --> 13:02.583
Of course I mean if the man is very bad

13:02.609 --> 13:04.943
and troublesome and all that then you can give him up.

13:04.968 --> 13:08.995
But what's the use of pining for another man,
living with one other man?

13:09.059 --> 13:11.482
Sort of a thing as you must have heard  about

13:11.507 --> 13:14.527
Tolstoy who was another great realized soul.

13:14.568 --> 13:19.561
He's written Anna Karenina and ultimately
he saw that Anna Karenina commits suicide.

13:19.586 --> 13:21.757
Because what she was doing a wrong thing you see,

13:21.813 --> 13:24.499
so he brought the whole thing so beautifully out

13:24.524 --> 13:27.848
and such an introspection all the time you see going on

13:27.873 --> 13:32.781
and also the futility of this kind of a romance that was there.

13:32.823 --> 13:37.026
So all this shows to us that

13:37.725 --> 13:41.116
there are people at the same time who are in the centre

13:41.187 --> 13:45.507
I would say in French writers also Maupassant was one of them

13:45.579 --> 13:48.831
whom I would put in the centre. He showed

13:48.895 --> 13:51.796
both the sides and he showed the right side also.

13:51.868 --> 13:59.046
So we have had Goethe,
we had many sort of people in Europe and England

13:59.260 --> 14:02.590
also in English language because
I am talking about English language.

14:02.709 --> 14:07.500
But also same in Sanskrit, in Hindi,
in every language we have the same

14:07.720 --> 14:10.761
type of people but more in Sanskrit.

14:10.831 --> 14:15.674
We don't have many people with this right or left side.

14:15.765 --> 14:20.610
The reason is: for literature there are some rules and regulations.

14:21.064 --> 14:26.871
It's not the Western idea in India
that we should be abandoned people.

14:26.990 --> 14:28.775
That's not accepted.

14:29.031 --> 14:33.234
So even in literature there is a kind of a restriction.

14:33.322 --> 14:35.956
What is a literature? Sahitya,

14:36.167 --> 14:40.822
it's called as sahit (सहित), means which will be benevolent.

14:41.068 --> 14:43.856
Sahita (सहित) means which will be benevolent.

14:43.945 --> 14:48.249
If it is not benevolent then it is not sahitya, it's not literature.

14:48.337 --> 14:49.753
Then it is trash.

14:49.873 --> 14:52.245
So that restriction you see,

14:52.388 --> 14:58.196
which is there which is given to us by great saints and seers,

14:58.315 --> 15:02.053
is still accepted. Of course, some people deviate a little bit,

15:02.133 --> 15:07.674
little bit they deviate, but once
they deviate it goes out of the society,

15:07.801 --> 15:10.567
people just don't read it.

15:10.796 --> 15:15.985
Say for example some people must have written
this Karma Sutra or something long time back

15:16.073 --> 15:18.450
but we never knew about it, we never read about it

15:18.495 --> 15:21.357
till the Germans came and made such an ado out of it,

15:21.382 --> 15:23.327
we never knew there are such books.

15:23.383 --> 15:25.591
Even now I don't know who wrote it

15:25.634 --> 15:28.865
or I've never read such a book, I've never seen it with My own eyes

15:28.915 --> 15:32.249
but we have heard about it that people wrote such things.

15:32.326 --> 15:36.480
But actually if you ask a ordinary human being

15:36.480 --> 15:39.876
in India who is maybe a scholar also,

15:39.940 --> 15:42.382
he will say, "What's that? I've never heard about it."

15:42.414 --> 15:45.575
But the Germans or the Japanese very particular

15:45.622 --> 15:48.567
on these things, they want to find all such things.

15:48.691 --> 15:57.424
So these creations of ugliness I should say,

15:57.504 --> 16:01.375
or of vulgarity, all these are a compensation for people

16:01.446 --> 16:07.481
who are very right-sided also
because a right-sided man will always take to drink.

16:07.771 --> 16:10.332
Because you see he wants to compensate

16:10.428 --> 16:15.102
so the right-sided man also will like such horrible things

16:15.173 --> 16:22.816
just to quench his thirst for power you see.

16:23.042 --> 16:25.901
He's so mad and then he would like

16:26.029 --> 16:33.029
to little bit neutralize that movement in such a way that

16:33.194 --> 16:38.820
his right-sided behavior is little bit compensated by the left side.

16:38.867 --> 16:43.125
So the people who are right-sided take to drinks very much.

16:43.204 --> 16:46.989
You will see people will work very hard and two nights,

16:47.029 --> 16:50.274
Saturday and Sunday night, they're just drunk.

16:50.378 --> 16:53.097
Then Monday they'll come out with a hangover.

16:53.209 --> 16:56.091
See it's very interesting to note how human being are.

16:56.131 --> 16:59.731
For five days they will slog, slog, slog, slog, slog

16:59.771 --> 17:04.379
and then two days they'll just go into
a kind of a hibernation as they say

17:04.443 --> 17:07.011
and absolutely lost to the whole world. Whether

17:07.062 --> 17:10.519
they are doctors or professionals, they don't care.

17:10.648 --> 17:15.611
So whatever they earn in five days
they'll spend it in these two days in drinking and finish it off.

17:15.714 --> 17:26.669
So that's how the total gain in all that creativity comes in.

17:28.295 --> 17:39.438
Now, when these extreme things start showing results

17:40.068 --> 17:43.936
and then the artist gets just fed up

17:44.300 --> 17:48.808
with this kind of thing going on all round he sees and all that.

17:49.237 --> 17:55.194
Then within him rises a subtler attitude

17:55.305 --> 17:59.682
towards creativity, towards art, towards books and all that

17:59.746 --> 18:07.610
and then he starts in that, reading about
the true knowledge pure knowledge.

18:07.674 --> 18:13.197
He wants to see paintings or he wants to

18:13.427 --> 18:18.129
listen to music which sings of Divine or divinity.

18:18.521 --> 18:23.828
Whole that madness

18:24.994 --> 18:29.175
makes him really think that now
we should start doing something better

18:29.314 --> 18:33.784
and then the Mahasaraswati Principle starts working out.

18:33.888 --> 18:37.701
But in that also when they start thinking of God,

18:37.780 --> 18:39.740
they fall into traps.

18:39.845 --> 18:43.411
Like you see somebody might fall into some sort of a religion.

18:43.507 --> 18:47.203
Now as you know these religions so-called are just money-oriented

18:47.259 --> 18:52.540
or power-oriented. They are not at all in no way spirit-oriented.

18:52.699 --> 18:55.647
That's the reason when they are not spirit-oriented

18:55.769 --> 19:04.036
what they give people is a kind of a personality which is all mental.

19:04.219 --> 19:07.999
You ask them about Upanishads

19:08.230 --> 19:11.420
they will recite verses after verses.

19:11.532 --> 19:14.844
Gita they'll give big lectures on that hours together.

19:14.869 --> 19:17.424
For this Chinmoy you see if you hear him,

19:17.457 --> 19:21.696
he speaks for hours together on Gita
you get tired and bored stiff with his lectures.

19:21.807 --> 19:25.136
He can speak about it but nothing inside. Nothing

19:25.353 --> 19:29.211
inside and whatever they speak has no effect on others also

19:29.251 --> 19:33.060
because they are not awakened people,
they are not connected with the Divine

19:33.108 --> 19:37.297
and whatever they do is just mental.

19:37.446 --> 19:43.485
So when the Mahasaraswati Principle is awakened
you start seeing it clearly

19:43.581 --> 19:50.581
that "This is mental, this is not the truth,
there must be something higher."

19:52.644 --> 19:58.900
They read about all the spiritual

19:58.964 --> 20:02.412
works in their own religion in which they are born,

20:02.463 --> 20:06.994
then they start moving out
and reading about some other religions also.

20:07.034 --> 20:10.021
Then this thing that every religion says the same thing

20:10.140 --> 20:12.637
then it comes to the Agya point.

20:12.725 --> 20:15.391
When it comes to the Agya point only

20:15.549 --> 20:20.470
there then suddenly they realize that there is something wrong,

20:20.511 --> 20:24.207
that people are mentally only accepting this religion

20:24.323 --> 20:27.947
and there must be something beyond this.

20:28.074 --> 20:32.430
At that point if somebody gets the realization,

20:32.525 --> 20:35.217
he just takes to it.

20:35.314 --> 20:40.245
But this Mahasaraswati Principle
has to be awakened in all the people

20:40.293 --> 20:45.020
who are musicians, who are artists, who are this and that and that.

20:45.139 --> 20:50.176
And those who have reached that state,
then suddenly they can get realization very easily.

20:50.326 --> 20:54.724
I've seen some people, very great artists they are today

20:54.819 --> 20:58.384
but when they came to Me first
were not at all well known or anything.

20:58.409 --> 21:02.691
But when they came to Me while singing only
they got their realization just singing.

21:02.756 --> 21:07.101
Or there was one gentleman who was just playing tabla before Me,

21:07.292 --> 21:10.196
I would not so good, all right,

21:10.395 --> 21:15.465
and then I was in Pune where I saw him,

21:15.608 --> 21:21.101
and in Pune he was playing very well and I said,
"He's the same fellow."

21:21.210 --> 21:25.557
But somebody said, "No, no, Mother,
he's not the same, he was not such a great player."

21:25.676 --> 21:29.168
I said, "All right." I had taken some flowers
for these musicians so I sent it.

21:29.232 --> 21:30.823
He came running and touched My feet.

21:30.848 --> 21:32.848
"Mother, have you not recognized me or what?"

21:32.873 --> 21:36.036
I said, "I have, that's why I have brought you the flowers."
I didn't know what to say.

21:36.061 --> 21:40.777
But the way he had improved,
now he is a world famous tabla player, world famous.

21:40.992 --> 21:45.021
It has happened with many others also the sarod people with the

21:45.292 --> 21:48.509
sitar people, so many people have achieved a lot.

21:48.589 --> 21:54.033
Musicians they after coming to Me they have

21:56.655 --> 22:05.173
asked Me that "Please, do something that
we should be able to enhance our creativity."

22:05.298 --> 22:08.337
I just said, "Take to Sahaj, that's all."

22:08.528 --> 22:13.890
And when they were awakened very surprisingly today most of them are

22:13.986 --> 22:18.244
very well known musicians and very famous in India.

22:18.474 --> 22:22.918
Of course, the Western musicians I don't know
where to lay My hands because I don't know,

22:23.021 --> 22:26.732
till they the way they are screaming these days I think their

22:26.819 --> 22:30.089
throats will be out may be something then they might come to Me.

22:30.260 --> 22:35.557
But on the whole My own idea is this,

22:39.079 --> 22:45.681
that those who have reached Mahasaraswati level

22:46.243 --> 22:54.133
through reading or through creativity,
but through writings or anything,

22:54.240 --> 23:00.210
when they reach a certain state of Agya,

23:00.901 --> 23:05.262
then either they get disappointed go to the left

23:05.809 --> 23:08.586
and absolutely think that this is all useless.

23:08.690 --> 23:18.382
Or else if they get realization they become
really very dynamic artists,

23:18.680 --> 23:27.716
very dynamic writers and people
who are creating something of an eternal value.

23:27.962 --> 23:31.395
So many Sahaja Yogis who have never spoken

23:31.483 --> 23:34.978
on the stage, who have never been on the stage

23:35.003 --> 23:37.249
they said, "We had a fright for the stage."

23:37.391 --> 23:46.074
They all, surprisingly now have become great orators
and speak very well and know so much.

23:46.359 --> 23:49.471
So this is the Mahasaraswati Principle.

23:49.567 --> 23:52.947
Now this makes you a person much subtler

23:53.045 --> 23:58.692
and you start becoming aware that the gross understanding we had

23:58.812 --> 24:06.049
about our art or our creativity has to be subtler,

24:06.279 --> 24:08.465
we have to be subtler people.

24:08.561 --> 24:13.843
And then such writers only appeal to people who are subtler.

24:14.073 --> 24:16.888
Like William Blake was regarded as a mad poet.

24:16.952 --> 24:19.462
I mean in India I never read about him.

24:19.597 --> 24:24.673
I did read on My own but in the colleges university
they never had William Blake

24:24.799 --> 24:27.846
or in any book as such there was no William Blake.

24:27.997 --> 24:33.608
But when you go to these people and talk to them,

24:33.775 --> 24:38.424
there was one called Mascaro fellow, he has translated Gita

24:38.527 --> 24:46.638
into English, is a very wonderful person. He is, actually I think

24:46.765 --> 24:53.064
he is a Italian. Now he is no more. He lived in near Cambridge.

24:53.159 --> 24:55.672
I went to see him, he was very anxious to meet Me

24:55.759 --> 25:00.549
and when I went there you'll be amazed, he did My aarti,

25:00.685 --> 25:05.761
and he said a mantra in Sanskrit that "Oh God,

25:06.023 --> 25:08.195
You have come to my house!

25:08.275 --> 25:12.755
What have I done in my previous lives that You are in my house?"

25:12.800 --> 25:15.453
Such a beautiful poet, you see,

25:15.580 --> 25:20.770
and he said in Sanskrit language, he was a master of Sanskrit.

25:20.939 --> 25:24.989
So I asked him, "From which book you have taken this couplet?"

25:25.014 --> 25:27.554
He said, "I've composed it myself."

25:27.658 --> 25:31.740
So beautiful it was, and then he said
certain things from Gita and all that.

25:31.847 --> 25:34.774
And he said, "Mother, I don't know You might be ..."

25:34.799 --> 25:37.529
He was very old that time. He was eighty years of age.

25:37.529 --> 25:42.546
He said, "Mother, maybe You might be able to change these English,

25:42.649 --> 25:44.692
but I don't think I've done anything.

25:44.756 --> 25:49.173
Even when I translated Gita they are just reading only.
Reading Gita, that's all.

25:49.292 --> 25:51.335
So what's the use of my translation?

25:51.391 --> 25:54.227
Just like Bible. Now they are reading word by word Gita.

25:54.298 --> 25:56.823
So, finished! What's the use of doing this work?"

25:56.848 --> 25:59.409
And he was so disappointed with the whole thing.

25:59.575 --> 26:02.392
So he said, "What will You work out? How will You work out?"

26:02.438 --> 26:04.553
I said, "All right, I'll try."

26:04.592 --> 26:07.945
He said, "Of course, You are there; You are an Incarnation."

26:07.970 --> 26:09.725
He just recognized Me.

26:09.876 --> 26:11.409
"I know You'll work it out."

26:11.409 --> 26:16.101
He wrote a very nice letter to Me also and then he died.

26:16.315 --> 26:19.609
But such a nice man and he suffered a lot.

26:19.663 --> 26:21.527
Nobody tried to understand him.

26:21.606 --> 26:25.070
He said, "I talked to so many scientists and things

26:25.104 --> 26:29.070
and they're absolutely useless and very superficial.

26:29.149 --> 26:31.526
So I don't think in this country of England

26:31.558 --> 26:34.728
You'll be able to do much, is a very superficial country."

26:34.753 --> 26:40.002
There were at least twenty English Sahaja Yogis
with Me sitting there listening to it.

26:40.065 --> 26:43.986
He said, "They are extremely superficial,
this language is superficial,

26:44.065 --> 26:48.491
they don't know about anything about Spirit
or anything about Kundalini."

26:48.547 --> 26:51.882
And he was a very well read man very deep person

26:51.936 --> 26:56.195
and he told Me that while he was studying

26:56.895 --> 27:01.941
gradually he felt this Mahasaraswati Principle
the way he didn't say Mahasaraswati339

27:02.060 --> 27:05.056
but he felt there must be subtler knowledge subtler knowledge.

27:05.120 --> 27:09.162
So he took to books like Gita, this, that, and

27:09.289 --> 27:12.491
then suddenly he felt that it's all reading again.

27:12.578 --> 27:16.503
It's just the same like translation
and specially when he translated Gita

27:16.556 --> 27:23.186
he was amazed that people were just reading it like Bible then.

27:23.417 --> 27:26.015
Then he said that "Mother, I don't know how

27:26.087 --> 27:29.594
but one day I was praying to Mother Mary and

27:29.716 --> 27:33.061
to the Holy Ghost and I got my realization."

27:33.231 --> 27:37.540
So he was a realized soul and he saw Me in dream, you see.

27:37.579 --> 27:41.326
He said, "In dream You came and gave me realization."
It's surprising.

27:41.466 --> 27:45.429
He saw Me in dream and he got ...
There's another few people who have got it, but

27:45.686 --> 27:47.855
specially him. I was so surprised so when

27:47.880 --> 27:50.132
I arrived in his house he recognized Me immediately.

27:50.157 --> 27:51.605
He said, " I saw You in my dream.

27:51.637 --> 27:54.948
You came and gave me realization, You awakened my Kundalini 354

27:54.973 --> 27:56.595
and You gave me realization."

27:56.687 --> 28:01.336
So you can imagine that this gentleman was so beautifully

28:01.456 --> 28:05.627
placed so subtle, he was that at the Agya point.

28:05.652 --> 28:08.559
He just got the dream and he got realization.

28:08.669 --> 28:12.697
And he said, "All the knowledge is now revealed to me so much more."

28:12.809 --> 28:14.839
And then he sat down with Me.

28:14.990 --> 28:18.172
And he said, "Can you stay for some time?"
I said, "I am now going away."

28:18.259 --> 28:21.463
But at least for five hours he was talking to Me.

28:21.574 --> 28:23.518
He was not tired, he would not leave Me.

28:23.626 --> 28:27.714
Such an old man was sitting at My feet.
I was telling him, "You sit on the chair."

28:27.739 --> 28:31.418
"'No, I'm very good. I'm very much all right You sitting there."

28:31.580 --> 28:36.938
So this is what happens with this
Mahasaraswati Principle developing within us.

28:36.994 --> 28:39.605
But we should allow that to grow within us.

28:39.716 --> 28:43.927
So in Sahaja Yoga we are not told that
we are not to read any book, not at all.

28:43.952 --> 28:48.108
We have to read, but in that book we have to see the subtle points

28:48.160 --> 28:53.009
and see for yourself. I don't read any scriptures,
because I don't need to read.

28:53.089 --> 28:58.199
But when I started reading the, you see, these intellectuals,

28:58.224 --> 29:01.763
what they have to say, I was amazed
that they are saying the same thing.

29:01.796 --> 29:06.755
There's nothing new. What I know,
what I say, that's what they are saying.

29:06.835 --> 29:10.529
There's nothing new about it; there's nothing special about it.

29:10.609 --> 29:12.946
Just what all the scriptures have said,

29:13.002 --> 29:16.910
they have said the same thing,
and these people are saying the same thing.

29:17.084 --> 29:21.416
But by saying these things, how are they going to propagate?

29:21.832 --> 29:26.142
Nothing. It will be just again something that will happen outside

29:26.245 --> 29:29.575
and it will drop out.

29:29.734 --> 29:32.376
It doesn't become part and part of yourself,

29:32.448 --> 29:36.253
so it has to become innate. That's only possible

29:36.278 --> 29:39.694
if your Spirit comes into your attention.

29:39.734 --> 29:41.345
There's no other way out.

29:41.435 --> 29:44.137
So luckily you all are realized souls

29:44.201 --> 29:47.743
and your Mahasaraswati is very much there,

29:47.828 --> 29:49.747
but I would say you must read.

29:49.843 --> 29:52.636
Read books of value and understand

29:52.700 --> 29:57.000
how it is absolute Sahaja Yoga there, how it is there.

29:57.079 --> 30:00.678
Anything you take up you'll be surprised that

30:00.875 --> 30:03.221
all these books are talking about Sahaja Yoga.

30:03.261 --> 30:07.380
May not be all of it, but part of the Sahaja Yoga is there.

30:07.507 --> 30:11.902
All of them talk of some part of Sahaja Yoga
but not the whole of it,

30:11.934 --> 30:13.954
because they came at different times.

30:14.010 --> 30:16.481
And now the Sahaja Yoga is the time when

30:16.537 --> 30:20.873
you have to know the complete, integrated knowledge of this

30:21.477 --> 30:25.377
religious thought that was there. Complete integrated.

30:25.447 --> 30:29.279
And that's how you understand that all religions are integrated.

30:29.435 --> 30:32.356
So one should, in Sahaja Yoga, after you come, people

30:32.412 --> 30:34.419
don't take to any reading.  Is a wrong thing.

30:34.444 --> 30:40.499
They should read and understand
what others have said, where have they gone wrong.

30:40.586 --> 30:42.586
But not these nonsensical people.

30:42.686 --> 30:47.219
You shouldn't read these nonsensical people
which you know are nonsensical.

30:47.264 --> 30:51.786
But so many, the other day I got this book of the Christian Science.

30:51.799 --> 30:54.776
It's all Bible nothing special about it.

30:54.969 --> 30:58.578
They are saying you should not do this;
you should not do this, and all that.

30:58.610 --> 31:02.869
It's all written in the Bible.
What new things are you telling? Nothing.

31:03.108 --> 31:06.255
You don't need a science for that. It's just there.

31:06.326 --> 31:10.924
But they are making money out of it by explaining and this and this.

31:10.949 --> 31:12.604
No explanation needed.

31:12.672 --> 31:17.279
Because that has to come within yourself
is the point which is not there.

31:17.612 --> 31:21.954
So now, this Mahaswaraswati Principle is awakened within us

31:22.002 --> 31:29.531
and we have to read and see
the subtle side of this growth of thought,

31:29.658 --> 31:33.298
how it grew up and how it became subtler and subtler,

31:33.478 --> 31:37.415
and how so many people in the world have contributed to it.

31:37.487 --> 31:44.403
So many artists, so many musicians and so many, we can say,

31:44.705 --> 31:51.190
writers who have really contributed to the central path of Sushumna416

31:51.277 --> 31:55.157
because they became realized souls.
They were realized souls.

31:55.189 --> 32:02.486
Some were born, and some became,
and then they completely wrote about the yoga.

32:02.573 --> 32:06.515
For example Rabindranath Tagore, in the beginning he writes,

32:06.540 --> 32:09.486
"How, when will I meet you my friend?" and all that.

32:09.560 --> 32:12.714
What you call the separation song, [INAUDIBLE] yoga.

32:12.810 --> 32:17.327
And then after some time, suddenly he gets his realization,

32:17.406 --> 32:19.978
because he becomes subtler and subtler and subtler.

32:20.034 --> 32:25.001
Then he writes about his meeting,

32:25.085 --> 32:28.030
his meeting the Spirit and he writes about it.

32:28.165 --> 32:32.344
So these things work out in such a manner for some people

32:32.447 --> 32:38.543
that by their subtleties they arrive at a point of realization.

32:38.614 --> 32:40.720
Same thing happened with Buddha.

32:40.752 --> 32:44.061
He did the same thing. He renounced everything,

32:44.086 --> 32:48.791
renounced His family went out, read Upanishads this, that.

32:48.871 --> 32:52.642
Everything He read and ultimately reached Gaya

32:52.667 --> 32:57.028
where He was sleeping under a banyan tree.

32:57.211 --> 33:03.217
And while sleeping only, He was so tired and fed up,

33:03.962 --> 33:10.086
He got his realization. And that's what is very important.

33:10.118 --> 33:14.659
But for the Buddhists what He did before going there is important.

33:14.707 --> 33:19.461
So they also want to also renounce this
and become sanyasis, this, that.

33:19.486 --> 33:23.300
But by becoming that, nothing is going to happen. It's going to Gaya

33:23.325 --> 33:27.086
and sleeping there also won't happen.
It has to happen because

33:27.134 --> 33:33.075
He was a pure seeker, true seeker and that's why it happened.

33:33.520 --> 33:38.524
But for Sahaja Yogis, they don't have to do
anything of the kind they just get it, realization.

33:38.563 --> 33:44.559
Because I think most of them in their last lives
have crossed most of their problems,

33:44.584 --> 33:48.215
and have known that it's nothing,
it's all nonsense in all these things.

33:48.240 --> 33:51.974
Or maybe in this life also
they must have realized it's all nonsense.

33:51.999 --> 33:55.416
And then they must have come to Sahaja Yoga.

33:55.518 --> 34:02.650
So it's a very great luck for you that you are here
and you've got your realization

34:02.841 --> 34:04.614
and that you are enjoying yourself.

34:04.653 --> 34:07.828
May God bless you!

34:18.775 --> 34:24.484
Another side which I have left over is the
political side - on the right side, you see.

34:24.587 --> 34:31.683
Even in politics, the growth becomes subtler and subtler.

34:31.810 --> 34:36.911
Like in say, we can say, in Russia

34:37.046 --> 34:41.012
when it was such a power-oriented thing. It's not money-oriented.

34:41.108 --> 34:44.966
The Communism was so power-oriented it reached a place that

34:44.998 --> 34:47.946
person like Gorbachev was to be born

34:48.217 --> 34:54.265
who would put it in a proper sense, and he came on a central path.

34:54.299 --> 34:59.537
He didn't want complete democracy
as it is in America, it's a demonocracy,

34:59.706 --> 35:01.845
but he wanted a balanced thing.

35:01.901 --> 35:05.259
So far he has not been able to manage, but I'm sure one day

35:05.284 --> 35:09.930
he will be managed, but he will be known
all over the world for his great,

35:12.380 --> 35:18.335
great thought and great work of reducing the pressure

35:18.406 --> 35:23.921
between the two great,or say between the two ideologists.

35:24.032 --> 35:28.292
And he's done such a good thing that now there's no war,

35:28.346 --> 35:32.740
going to be no war, as I mean not a very big world war

35:32.765 --> 35:34.378
but could be little bit here and there.

35:34.426 --> 35:38.303
That also is coming up which is a problem of fundamentalism,

35:38.328 --> 35:40.866
is not due to political but fundamentalism.

35:41.061 --> 35:43.888
So now the problem today is fundamentalism

35:43.936 --> 35:46.768
and that also comes from the right side, absolutely.

35:46.987 --> 35:51.397
Fundamentalists are all right-sided people and this right-sidedness

35:51.456 --> 35:56.520
takes them to any extreme of violence could be or,

35:56.679 --> 36:01.286
in some cases, it's really crazy and madness.

36:01.418 --> 36:05.302
But a new disease has started now those who go too much to the right

36:05.362 --> 36:08.892
is called as a yuppies disease where the whole

36:08.917 --> 36:13.480
conscious mind goes out of order and you become like a reptile.

36:13.480 --> 36:18.979
I've seen people being carried like big fishes
on the shoulders you see

36:19.004 --> 36:24.191
and put in a seat and they just know everything,
by brain is all right.

36:24.279 --> 36:28.233
But they understand everything. They can talk well

36:28.297 --> 36:33.821
but they cannot move their hands,
cannot move their feet if they want to.

36:33.891 --> 36:36.174
Unconsciously they may, but consciously they cannot,

36:36.206 --> 36:41.139
and this disease is the one which is a warning to everyone.

36:41.798 --> 36:46.491
So we have be careful in Sahaja Yoga also,
we should not go too much to the right

36:46.516 --> 36:50.504
is also very dangerous, too.
Some people become very fanatic and

36:50.570 --> 36:54.051
start teaching Sahaja Yoga in a very fanatical manner

36:54.083 --> 36:58.252
and sort of you see, make a ... I don't know what to call that.

36:58.347 --> 37:01.597
But sometimes I see some people speaking in a manner

37:01.622 --> 37:05.182
that one should never speak that way because we are Sahaja Yogis.

37:05.207 --> 37:11.035
The main thing is love, compassion,

37:11.908 --> 37:19.581
which is a living force and
must be done everything, with that force,

37:20.454 --> 37:28.934
which is a beautiful, living force which creates these flowers,

37:29.096 --> 37:33.289
which does all kinds of beautiful constructive things.

37:33.345 --> 37:42.153
It should not be in any way a oppression, domination

37:43.931 --> 37:48.233
or in any kind of command. You should not do like this,

37:48.273 --> 37:51.359
and organization, nothing of the kind.

37:51.423 --> 37:56.501
It is something so spontaneous, so beautiful, just works out.

37:56.805 --> 38:01.344
But as these trees have to be embedded in the Mother Earth,

38:01.392 --> 38:06.243
in the same way you should be embedded
in the principle of Sahaja Yoga

38:06.268 --> 38:10.574
which is compassion, love, and divine grace.

38:10.616 --> 38:15.394
If it is not there, then you'll have problems with leadership
and you'll have problems with ...

38:15.419 --> 38:19.163
Anybody who's a violent person cannot stay in Sahaja Yoga.

38:19.209 --> 38:22.931
He has to disappear. Either he should change himself entirely

38:23.050 --> 38:27.145
or he has to disappear. It doesn't work out
with people who are violent.

38:27.307 --> 38:31.645
So one has to understand that you may be in any position,

38:31.677 --> 38:36.854
you may be anywhere, you may be a very poor person,

38:36.879 --> 38:40.279
you may be very rich but makes no difference for a Sahaja Yogi.

38:40.304 --> 38:44.467
The best thing to judge yourself is that

38:44.547 --> 38:48.600
whenever we are doing anything for anyone or saying anything,

38:48.625 --> 38:53.567
is it benevolent or is it violent?

38:54.565 --> 39:03.134
Is it for our self-propagation or self,

39:04.450 --> 39:10.874
holier-than-thou sort of a principle
or it is for the goodness of others?

39:11.429 --> 39:15.833
Once you start judging like that, you'll be amazed that

39:16.031 --> 39:19.562
your whole system will change,

39:19.658 --> 39:23.610
your way of talking, your way of working it out.

39:23.681 --> 39:27.020
For example today you see there was a lady
who wouldn't allow Me to talk at all.

39:27.045 --> 39:30.706
She was talking all the time about something
which was not important.

39:30.762 --> 39:34.805
But still I was working it out because I knew that
there's no need to talk now.

39:34.932 --> 39:36.952
With this gentleman I can work it out.

39:37.016 --> 39:42.918
So it is always so that you should try to see the whole thing

39:43.085 --> 39:48.756
as a complete play and take a very,

39:57.303 --> 40:00.745
a witness state, in a witness state you should watch.

40:00.770 --> 40:03.712
If you watch everything in a witness state

40:03.768 --> 40:09.428
then you can handle the whole situation very nicely,

40:09.568 --> 40:13.618
even if you do not talk, if you do not say anything still

40:13.633 --> 40:17.056
in a witness state you become very powerful,

40:17.180 --> 40:22.484
and in that witness state you can easily solve lots of problems.

40:23.099 --> 40:25.730
May God bless you!
