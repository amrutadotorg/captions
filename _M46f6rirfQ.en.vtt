00:01:05.886 --> 00:01:11.139
I see many more New Zealanders, very happy to see all of you here.

00:01:27.185 --> 00:01:31.304
Today I thought we should have Mahasaraswati's Puja.

00:01:31.364 --> 00:01:33.074
Would be a good idea,

00:01:33.354 --> 00:01:37.143
Because we did Mahalakshmi, let's have Mahasaraswati.

00:01:42.896 --> 00:01:50.257
So, Mahasaraswati Principle is on the right side as you all know.

00:01:50.833 --> 00:01:55.357
First is the Brahmadeva's Principle,

00:01:55.508 --> 00:02:00.941
which is the Saraswati Principle, and then

00:02:01.664 --> 00:02:04.991
this Mahasaraswati takes you

00:02:06.721 --> 00:02:15.210
to the principle of Mahabrahmadeva  called as Hiranyagarbha.

00:02:16.723 --> 00:02:23.515
Now this Hiranyagarbha Principle is very important for Sahaja Yogis.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.372
First of all, those who think too much

00:02:31.591 --> 00:02:36.034
or those who create too much without realization,

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:41.717
those who express themselves in poetry

00:02:41.908 --> 00:02:50.891
or in literature or in music, you can say,

00:02:51.753 --> 00:02:56.542
in paintings, in all kinds of arts;

00:02:57.225 --> 00:02:59.784
if they are not realized souls,

00:03:00.385 --> 00:03:05.068
then they go to the left to the extreme or to the right.

00:03:05.568 --> 00:03:13.813
So for example if there is an artist, if he goes to the right

00:03:14.416 --> 00:03:23.313
gradually his paintings will become extremely violent expressions.

00:03:24.365 --> 00:03:32.031
Would be very much showing something very violent

00:03:33.896 --> 00:03:44.472
and also rather, I would say he would be a man
who would be inflexible.

00:03:44.845 --> 00:03:48.224
He'll have his own style; he can't move into another style.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.918
He'll use the same style and he will not get into any other style.

00:03:54.339 --> 00:04:04.811
Kind of a austere nature he develops in his productions

00:04:05.516 --> 00:04:11.295
and then when he gets tired of it, then he will take to something

00:04:11.391 --> 00:04:15.648
you can say like abstract art

00:04:15.847 --> 00:04:23.401
but without realization the abstract art
can be something very absurd and funny.

00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:29.235
I have seen the extremes of it that I've seen people

00:04:29.506 --> 00:04:37.792
who put big canvases on the ground and poured lots of oil paints

00:04:38.101 --> 00:04:43.383
one after another and roll over it, is supposed to be a painting.

00:04:43.687 --> 00:04:45.914
They say this is spontaneous

00:04:46.017 --> 00:04:51.662
because they fell on it or they rolled on that
so is spontaneous painting that's come out.

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:58.034
Now this spontaneous painting should come
from a spontaneous personality

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.253
not by rolling on thing or something,
I mean, all sorts of things they do

00:05:02.473 --> 00:05:07.367
but there's no end to it to which nonsensical things they think of.

00:05:07.726 --> 00:05:10.191
And they think they have achieved a lot and they've done a lot

00:05:10.231 --> 00:05:14.746
and also they sell it to people who have too much of right side.

00:05:14.992 --> 00:05:18.950
They like it. So...

00:05:21.982 --> 00:05:29.044
they put in lot of effort to create this kind of a painting.

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:35.882
Also that today's pop music also,
which is very aggressive, is from the same

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:41.302
outcome because you cannot ascend, so you move to your right.

00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:46.111
And this pop music then starts now it's becoming so horribly noisy,

00:05:46.191 --> 00:05:52.703
I don't know what to call it. Absolutely it can deafen your ears

00:05:52.822 --> 00:05:56.552
if you listen to it and the whole thing is,

00:05:56.658 --> 00:06:00.808
the whole gestures and all that are so ugly and so aggressive

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:07.606
as if they're going to eat the mike sometimes
I feel the way go on with the mike and things.

00:06:07.891 --> 00:06:12.593
And see then these people also impress such people

00:06:12.633 --> 00:06:16.456
who are very right-sided and so they become popular.

00:06:16.559 --> 00:06:21.715
But the popularity is not the sign of real success.

00:06:21.837 --> 00:06:24.001
It will come and go away.

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:29.416
All such artists and painters come and go away they have no,

00:06:29.687 --> 00:06:34.149
no standing, they are there for a short time.

00:06:34.582 --> 00:06:39.818
And then the history talks about them
those who have been in the center54

00:06:39.905 --> 00:06:42.760
never about the people who went to the extremes.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.943
God knows how many must have come and gone.

00:06:45.031 --> 00:06:49.971
And those who are today also painting or singing
in that way tomorrow they will not be known.

00:06:50.128 --> 00:06:53.012
One after another you see the craze comes in one comes

00:06:53.043 --> 00:06:56.082
and goes away another so they are crazy people

00:06:56.193 --> 00:07:00.590
and they create a craze and the crazy like them enjoy the craze.

00:07:00.718 --> 00:07:05.068
So it amounts to something that is just wasteful

00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:08.655
creates no impression in the history.

00:07:09.425 --> 00:07:14.476
So this is the right-sided nonsense that
comes out of the right side movement

00:07:14.657 --> 00:07:21.259
of the sympathetic going too far with your creativity

00:07:21.652 --> 00:07:24.323
and also your writing.

00:07:25.196 --> 00:07:29.946
And there were many writers in English language
you know from Shakespeare you can start

00:07:30.097 --> 00:07:36.856
who showed the futility of human endeavour
like we call an avadhuta,

00:07:36.997 --> 00:07:44.198
the one who has reached a very great degree
of development in his spiritual life.

00:07:44.375 --> 00:07:47.258
He can see the futility of human endeavour

00:07:47.329 --> 00:07:53.229
and then he brings them to the point that they have to rise

00:07:53.363 --> 00:07:58.467
above these stupid and human endeavours
and take to some sort of an endeavour,

00:07:58.603 --> 00:08:01.307
which will bring them something higher

00:08:01.395 --> 00:08:05.133
and also will create something of an eternal value.

00:08:05.341 --> 00:08:09.623
Then also we have, I think in English language I have said,

00:08:09.748 --> 00:08:12.055
[INAUDIBLE] to Somerset Maugham and all that.

00:08:12.191 --> 00:08:15.357
They're very centrally placed people,

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:19.355
also Cronin was I would say, but then this Hemmingway came,

00:08:19.458 --> 00:08:22.517
and he started moving towards the right. Now I don't know

00:08:22.629 --> 00:08:26.108
I don't read now modern novels because all full of filth.

00:08:26.244 --> 00:08:28.102
So it moves to the right.

00:08:28.208 --> 00:08:34.291
So one is which moves to the right
and talks about all kinds of violence this that,

00:08:34.541 --> 00:08:40.124
that also is absolutely not palatable
to human consumption I tell you.

00:08:40.323 --> 00:08:42.993
But still they write and people like it.

00:08:43.168 --> 00:08:44.978
People want to read about Hitler,

00:08:45.003 --> 00:08:49.585
they want to read how people were killed, war stories this that.

00:08:49.592 --> 00:08:54.520
They want to see pictures which has full of violence,
who are killing this and that,

00:08:54.583 --> 00:09:00.610
so that their own desire to be
violent is satisfied in seeing those things

00:09:00.769 --> 00:09:07.769
in films and in, otherwise also reading such books of that kind.

00:09:08.213 --> 00:09:12.355
On the left hand side when they move you see these artists

00:09:12.467 --> 00:09:14.564
then same about musicians as I said

00:09:14.651 --> 00:09:19.698
that the musicians become sort of a absolutely

00:09:19.841 --> 00:09:23.494
suffering from Greek tragedy all the time.

00:09:23.685 --> 00:09:31.127
They go on crying and weeping and saying that this is sort of,

00:09:31.326 --> 00:09:36.206
we have been very sad and this sadness and the tragedy of life,

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:39.121
I mean they go on crying and make you cry also.

00:09:39.341 --> 00:09:47.444
So there's no hope for them and
they just go on doing such stupid things.

00:09:47.961 --> 00:09:54.256
Then we have you see many artists also of the same kind

00:09:54.463 --> 00:09:58.467
specially French. French writers as well as

00:09:58.618 --> 00:10:02.194
French poets also and French painters if you see.

00:10:02.226 --> 00:10:04.916
They are very left sided because they drink a lot.

00:10:04.987 --> 00:10:10.901
If you go in any France village after seven o'clock
you can't find even one person on the road

00:10:11.091 --> 00:10:14.549
and even if you want to find out the road and you knock at the door

00:10:14.628 --> 00:10:17.339
and request them that you would like to know

00:10:17.467 --> 00:10:21.159
some road and all that, they're all drunk already at seven o'clock.

00:10:21.317 --> 00:10:26.291
So with this thing they become extremely over-romantic type and

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:29.509
they sing songs of romance, have no romance in their life you see,

00:10:29.573 --> 00:10:33.680
they just, some sort of a imaginary romance they have

00:10:33.792 --> 00:10:38.430
and they live in that imaginary world of pain and sufferings

00:10:38.494 --> 00:10:44.715
and they have their own ideas about their own romantic models

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:48.640
that they formed in their heads you see with their left side.

00:10:48.764 --> 00:10:52.279
So the poets and the writers go to the left side like that

00:10:52.425 --> 00:10:56.401
and in say for example in our India we had those

00:10:56.472 --> 00:11:01.828
Muslims used to drink a lot then
they started a thing called as gazal 113

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:05.762
and that gazal is nothing but crying. Even in certain poets you see,

00:11:05.855 --> 00:11:09.204
we have this kind of a thing in the other places

00:11:09.276 --> 00:11:12.632
where there were many poets who were seeking God and were crying,

00:11:12.696 --> 00:11:17.528
"Oh God, when will I meet?" and in separation they are singing,

00:11:17.816 --> 00:11:23.807
not in the meeting, not in the yoga
but in separation they sing,

00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.872
'When will I meet You, oh God?" and all that.

00:11:25.897 --> 00:11:30.126
And all such people who are still seeking like such songs going on.

00:11:30.329 --> 00:11:31.531
Up to this much is all right

00:11:31.556 --> 00:11:35.539
but then you get lots of grotesque type of writers also

00:11:35.564 --> 00:11:37.774
who write such horrible things

00:11:37.799 --> 00:11:41.576
that you feel you are in hell the way
they describe things are horrible.

00:11:41.664 --> 00:11:45.225
And in Sanskrit called as bibhatsa (बीभत्स)create a bibhatsa-ras (बीभत्स रस).

00:11:45.326 --> 00:11:49.062
And it's the description of very filthy things

00:11:49.166 --> 00:11:52.456
which were never before even in English language.

00:11:52.528 --> 00:12:00.506
Never I saw that but now some books are full of filth and dirt

00:12:00.554 --> 00:12:06.586
and horrible sex descriptions that you just can't bear it.

00:12:06.729 --> 00:12:09.459
So all this comes with the left side movement that,

00:12:09.523 --> 00:12:14.591
because you see society also  moves from

00:12:14.678 --> 00:12:17.655
sometimes to the right sometimes to the left.

00:12:17.726 --> 00:12:20.669
So when it moves to the right they like right-sided things

00:12:20.717 --> 00:12:23.495
sometimes they move to the left they like left-sided things.

00:12:23.591 --> 00:12:26.626
So also there are people with two types of temperaments

00:12:26.689 --> 00:12:30.579
so that's how they start appreciating these things and

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:33.500
unnecessarily they believe that they are tragic.

00:12:33.729 --> 00:12:37.041
As you know about the Greek tragedy

00:12:37.081 --> 00:12:42.195
which is a very sort of a fundamental thing
I would say for a Western

00:12:42.393 --> 00:12:44.949
Western literature is a Greek tragedy

00:12:45.116 --> 00:12:49.887
where a woman marries a man but she doesn't love her husband

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:52.296
so she loves somebody else and that tragedy is there.

00:12:52.305 --> 00:12:55.624
I mean it's artificially created tragedy

00:12:55.696 --> 00:13:00.469
that shows that you are married to some man
and you should be happy with him.

00:13:00.564 --> 00:13:02.583
Of course I mean if the man is very bad

00:13:02.609 --> 00:13:04.943
and troublesome and all that then you can give him up.

00:13:04.968 --> 00:13:08.995
But what's the use of pining for another man,
living with one other man?

00:13:09.059 --> 00:13:11.482
Sort of a thing as you must have heard  about

00:13:11.507 --> 00:13:14.527
Tolstoy who was another great realized soul.

00:13:14.568 --> 00:13:19.561
He's written Anna Karenina and ultimately
he saw that Anna Karenina commits suicide.

00:13:19.586 --> 00:13:21.757
Because what she was doing a wrong thing you see,

00:13:21.813 --> 00:13:24.499
so he brought the whole thing so beautifully out

00:13:24.524 --> 00:13:27.848
and such an introspection all the time you see going on

00:13:27.873 --> 00:13:32.781
and also the futility of this kind of a romance that was there.

00:13:32.823 --> 00:13:37.026
So all this shows to us that

00:13:37.725 --> 00:13:41.116
there are people at the same time who are in the centre

00:13:41.187 --> 00:13:45.507
I would say in French writers also Maupassant was one of them

00:13:45.579 --> 00:13:48.831
whom I would put in the centre. He showed

00:13:48.895 --> 00:13:51.796
both the sides and he showed the right side also.

00:13:51.868 --> 00:13:59.046
So we have had Goethe,
we had many sort of people in Europe and England

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.590
also in English language because
I am talking about English language.

00:14:02.709 --> 00:14:07.500
But also same in Sanskrit, in Hindi,
in every language we have the same

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:10.761
type of people but more in Sanskrit.

00:14:10.831 --> 00:14:15.674
We don't have many people with this right or left side.

00:14:15.765 --> 00:14:20.610
The reason is: for literature there are some rules and regulations.

00:14:21.064 --> 00:14:26.871
It's not the Western idea in India
that we should be abandoned people.

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:28.775
That's not accepted.

00:14:29.031 --> 00:14:33.234
So even in literature there is a kind of a restriction.

00:14:33.322 --> 00:14:35.956
What is a literature? Sahitya,

00:14:36.167 --> 00:14:40.822
it's called as sahit (सहित), means which will be benevolent.

00:14:41.068 --> 00:14:43.856
Sahita (सहित) means which will be benevolent.

00:14:43.945 --> 00:14:48.249
If it is not benevolent then it is not sahitya, it's not literature.

00:14:48.337 --> 00:14:49.753
Then it is trash.

00:14:49.873 --> 00:14:52.245
So that restriction you see,

00:14:52.388 --> 00:14:58.196
which is there which is given to us by great saints and seers,

00:14:58.315 --> 00:15:02.053
is still accepted. Of course, some people deviate a little bit,

00:15:02.133 --> 00:15:07.674
little bit they deviate, but once
they deviate it goes out of the society,

00:15:07.801 --> 00:15:10.567
people just don't read it.

00:15:10.796 --> 00:15:15.985
Say for example some people must have written
this Karma Sutra or something long time back

00:15:16.073 --> 00:15:18.450
but we never knew about it, we never read about it

00:15:18.495 --> 00:15:21.357
till the Germans came and made such an ado out of it,

00:15:21.382 --> 00:15:23.327
we never knew there are such books.

00:15:23.383 --> 00:15:25.591
Even now I don't know who wrote it

00:15:25.634 --> 00:15:28.865
or I've never read such a book, I've never seen it with My own eyes

00:15:28.915 --> 00:15:32.249
but we have heard about it that people wrote such things.

00:15:32.326 --> 00:15:36.480
But actually if you ask a ordinary human being

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:39.876
in India who is maybe a scholar also,

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:42.382
he will say, "What's that? I've never heard about it."

00:15:42.414 --> 00:15:45.575
But the Germans or the Japanese very particular

00:15:45.622 --> 00:15:48.567
on these things, they want to find all such things.

00:15:48.691 --> 00:15:57.424
So these creations of ugliness I should say,

00:15:57.504 --> 00:16:01.375
or of vulgarity, all these are a compensation for people

00:16:01.446 --> 00:16:07.481
who are very right-sided also
because a right-sided man will always take to drink.

00:16:07.771 --> 00:16:10.332
Because you see he wants to compensate

00:16:10.428 --> 00:16:15.102
so the right-sided man also will like such horrible things

00:16:15.173 --> 00:16:22.816
just to quench his thirst for power you see.

00:16:23.042 --> 00:16:25.901
He's so mad and then he would like

00:16:26.029 --> 00:16:33.029
to little bit neutralize that movement in such a way that

00:16:33.194 --> 00:16:38.820
his right-sided behavior is little bit compensated by the left side.

00:16:38.867 --> 00:16:43.125
So the people who are right-sided take to drinks very much.

00:16:43.204 --> 00:16:46.989
You will see people will work very hard and two nights,

00:16:47.029 --> 00:16:50.274
Saturday and Sunday night, they're just drunk.

00:16:50.378 --> 00:16:53.097
Then Monday they'll come out with a hangover.

00:16:53.209 --> 00:16:56.091
See it's very interesting to note how human being are.

00:16:56.131 --> 00:16:59.731
For five days they will slog, slog, slog, slog, slog

00:16:59.771 --> 00:17:04.379
and then two days they'll just go into
a kind of a hibernation as they say

00:17:04.443 --> 00:17:07.011
and absolutely lost to the whole world. Whether

00:17:07.062 --> 00:17:10.519
they are doctors or professionals, they don't care.

00:17:10.648 --> 00:17:15.611
So whatever they earn in five days
they'll spend it in these two days in drinking and finish it off.

00:17:15.714 --> 00:17:26.669
So that's how the total gain in all that creativity comes in.

00:17:28.295 --> 00:17:39.438
Now, when these extreme things start showing results

00:17:40.068 --> 00:17:43.936
and then the artist gets just fed up

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:48.808
with this kind of thing going on all round he sees and all that.

00:17:49.237 --> 00:17:55.194
Then within him rises a subtler attitude

00:17:55.305 --> 00:17:59.682
towards creativity, towards art, towards books and all that

00:17:59.746 --> 00:18:07.610
and then he starts in that, reading about
the true knowledge pure knowledge.

00:18:07.674 --> 00:18:13.197
He wants to see paintings or he wants to

00:18:13.427 --> 00:18:18.129
listen to music which sings of Divine or divinity.

00:18:18.521 --> 00:18:23.828
Whole that madness

00:18:24.994 --> 00:18:29.175
makes him really think that now
we should start doing something better

00:18:29.314 --> 00:18:33.784
and then the Mahasaraswati Principle starts working out.

00:18:33.888 --> 00:18:37.701
But in that also when they start thinking of God,

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:39.740
they fall into traps.

00:18:39.845 --> 00:18:43.411
Like you see somebody might fall into some sort of a religion.

00:18:43.507 --> 00:18:47.203
Now as you know these religions so-called are just money-oriented

00:18:47.259 --> 00:18:52.540
or power-oriented. They are not at all in no way spirit-oriented.

00:18:52.699 --> 00:18:55.647
That's the reason when they are not spirit-oriented

00:18:55.769 --> 00:19:04.036
what they give people is a kind of a personality which is all mental.

00:19:04.219 --> 00:19:07.999
You ask them about Upanishads

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:11.420
they will recite verses after verses.

00:19:11.532 --> 00:19:14.844
Gita they'll give big lectures on that hours together.

00:19:14.869 --> 00:19:17.424
For this Chinmoy you see if you hear him,

00:19:17.457 --> 00:19:21.696
he speaks for hours together on Gita
you get tired and bored stiff with his lectures.

00:19:21.807 --> 00:19:25.136
He can speak about it but nothing inside. Nothing

00:19:25.353 --> 00:19:29.211
inside and whatever they speak has no effect on others also

00:19:29.251 --> 00:19:33.060
because they are not awakened people,
they are not connected with the Divine

00:19:33.108 --> 00:19:37.297
and whatever they do is just mental.

00:19:37.446 --> 00:19:43.485
So when the Mahasaraswati Principle is awakened
you start seeing it clearly

00:19:43.581 --> 00:19:50.581
that "This is mental, this is not the truth,
there must be something higher."

00:19:52.644 --> 00:19:58.900
They read about all the spiritual

00:19:58.964 --> 00:20:02.412
works in their own religion in which they are born,

00:20:02.463 --> 00:20:06.994
then they start moving out
and reading about some other religions also.

00:20:07.034 --> 00:20:10.021
Then this thing that every religion says the same thing

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:12.637
then it comes to the Agya point.

00:20:12.725 --> 00:20:15.391
When it comes to the Agya point only

00:20:15.549 --> 00:20:20.470
there then suddenly they realize that there is something wrong,

00:20:20.511 --> 00:20:24.207
that people are mentally only accepting this religion

00:20:24.323 --> 00:20:27.947
and there must be something beyond this.

00:20:28.074 --> 00:20:32.430
At that point if somebody gets the realization,

00:20:32.525 --> 00:20:35.217
he just takes to it.

00:20:35.314 --> 00:20:40.245
But this Mahasaraswati Principle
has to be awakened in all the people

00:20:40.293 --> 00:20:45.020
who are musicians, who are artists, who are this and that and that.

00:20:45.139 --> 00:20:50.176
And those who have reached that state,
then suddenly they can get realization very easily.

00:20:50.326 --> 00:20:54.724
I've seen some people, very great artists they are today

00:20:54.819 --> 00:20:58.384
but when they came to Me first
were not at all well known or anything.

00:20:58.409 --> 00:21:02.691
But when they came to Me while singing only
they got their realization just singing.

00:21:02.756 --> 00:21:07.101
Or there was one gentleman who was just playing tabla before Me,

00:21:07.292 --> 00:21:10.196
I would not so good, all right,

00:21:10.395 --> 00:21:15.465
and then I was in Pune where I saw him,

00:21:15.608 --> 00:21:21.101
and in Pune he was playing very well and I said,
"He's the same fellow."

00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:25.557
But somebody said, "No, no, Mother,
he's not the same, he was not such a great player."

00:21:25.676 --> 00:21:29.168
I said, "All right." I had taken some flowers
for these musicians so I sent it.

00:21:29.232 --> 00:21:30.823
He came running and touched My feet.

00:21:30.848 --> 00:21:32.848
"Mother, have you not recognized me or what?"

00:21:32.873 --> 00:21:36.036
I said, "I have, that's why I have brought you the flowers."
I didn't know what to say.

00:21:36.061 --> 00:21:40.777
But the way he had improved,
now he is a world famous tabla player, world famous.

00:21:40.992 --> 00:21:45.021
It has happened with many others also the sarod people with the

00:21:45.292 --> 00:21:48.509
sitar people, so many people have achieved a lot.

00:21:48.589 --> 00:21:54.033
Musicians they after coming to Me they have

00:21:56.655 --> 00:22:05.173
asked Me that "Please, do something that
we should be able to enhance our creativity."

00:22:05.298 --> 00:22:08.337
I just said, "Take to Sahaj, that's all."

00:22:08.528 --> 00:22:13.890
And when they were awakened very surprisingly today most of them are

00:22:13.986 --> 00:22:18.244
very well known musicians and very famous in India.

00:22:18.474 --> 00:22:22.918
Of course, the Western musicians I don't know
where to lay My hands because I don't know,

00:22:23.021 --> 00:22:26.732
till they the way they are screaming these days I think their

00:22:26.819 --> 00:22:30.089
throats will be out may be something then they might come to Me.

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:35.557
But on the whole My own idea is this,

00:22:39.079 --> 00:22:45.681
that those who have reached Mahasaraswati level

00:22:46.243 --> 00:22:54.133
through reading or through creativity,
but through writings or anything,

00:22:54.240 --> 00:23:00.210
when they reach a certain state of Agya,

00:23:00.901 --> 00:23:05.262
then either they get disappointed go to the left

00:23:05.809 --> 00:23:08.586
and absolutely think that this is all useless.

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:18.382
Or else if they get realization they become
really very dynamic artists,

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:27.716
very dynamic writers and people
who are creating something of an eternal value.

00:23:27.962 --> 00:23:31.395
So many Sahaja Yogis who have never spoken

00:23:31.483 --> 00:23:34.978
on the stage, who have never been on the stage

00:23:35.003 --> 00:23:37.249
they said, "We had a fright for the stage."

00:23:37.391 --> 00:23:46.074
They all, surprisingly now have become great orators
and speak very well and know so much.

00:23:46.359 --> 00:23:49.471
So this is the Mahasaraswati Principle.

00:23:49.567 --> 00:23:52.947
Now this makes you a person much subtler

00:23:53.045 --> 00:23:58.692
and you start becoming aware that the gross understanding we had

00:23:58.812 --> 00:24:06.049
about our art or our creativity has to be subtler,

00:24:06.279 --> 00:24:08.465
we have to be subtler people.

00:24:08.561 --> 00:24:13.843
And then such writers only appeal to people who are subtler.

00:24:14.073 --> 00:24:16.888
Like William Blake was regarded as a mad poet.

00:24:16.952 --> 00:24:19.462
I mean in India I never read about him.

00:24:19.597 --> 00:24:24.673
I did read on My own but in the colleges university
they never had William Blake

00:24:24.799 --> 00:24:27.846
or in any book as such there was no William Blake.

00:24:27.997 --> 00:24:33.608
But when you go to these people and talk to them,

00:24:33.775 --> 00:24:38.424
there was one called Mascaro fellow, he has translated Gita

00:24:38.527 --> 00:24:46.638
into English, is a very wonderful person. He is, actually I think

00:24:46.765 --> 00:24:53.064
he is a Italian. Now he is no more. He lived in near Cambridge.

00:24:53.159 --> 00:24:55.672
I went to see him, he was very anxious to meet Me

00:24:55.759 --> 00:25:00.549
and when I went there you'll be amazed, he did My aarti,

00:25:00.685 --> 00:25:05.761
and he said a mantra in Sanskrit that "Oh God,

00:25:06.023 --> 00:25:08.195
You have come to my house!

00:25:08.275 --> 00:25:12.755
What have I done in my previous lives that You are in my house?"

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:15.453
Such a beautiful poet, you see,

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:20.770
and he said in Sanskrit language, he was a master of Sanskrit.

00:25:20.939 --> 00:25:24.989
So I asked him, "From which book you have taken this couplet?"

00:25:25.014 --> 00:25:27.554
He said, "I've composed it myself."

00:25:27.658 --> 00:25:31.740
So beautiful it was, and then he said
certain things from Gita and all that.

00:25:31.847 --> 00:25:34.774
And he said, "Mother, I don't know You might be ..."

00:25:34.799 --> 00:25:37.529
He was very old that time. He was eighty years of age.

00:25:37.529 --> 00:25:42.546
He said, "Mother, maybe You might be able to change these English,

00:25:42.649 --> 00:25:44.692
but I don't think I've done anything.

00:25:44.756 --> 00:25:49.173
Even when I translated Gita they are just reading only.
Reading Gita, that's all.

00:25:49.292 --> 00:25:51.335
So what's the use of my translation?

00:25:51.391 --> 00:25:54.227
Just like Bible. Now they are reading word by word Gita.

00:25:54.298 --> 00:25:56.823
So, finished! What's the use of doing this work?"

00:25:56.848 --> 00:25:59.409
And he was so disappointed with the whole thing.

00:25:59.575 --> 00:26:02.392
So he said, "What will You work out? How will You work out?"

00:26:02.438 --> 00:26:04.553
I said, "All right, I'll try."

00:26:04.592 --> 00:26:07.945
He said, "Of course, You are there; You are an Incarnation."

00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:09.725
He just recognized Me.

00:26:09.876 --> 00:26:11.409
"I know You'll work it out."

00:26:11.409 --> 00:26:16.101
He wrote a very nice letter to Me also and then he died.

00:26:16.315 --> 00:26:19.609
But such a nice man and he suffered a lot.

00:26:19.663 --> 00:26:21.527
Nobody tried to understand him.

00:26:21.606 --> 00:26:25.070
He said, "I talked to so many scientists and things

00:26:25.104 --> 00:26:29.070
and they're absolutely useless and very superficial.

00:26:29.149 --> 00:26:31.526
So I don't think in this country of England

00:26:31.558 --> 00:26:34.728
You'll be able to do much, is a very superficial country."

00:26:34.753 --> 00:26:40.002
There were at least twenty English Sahaja Yogis
with Me sitting there listening to it.

00:26:40.065 --> 00:26:43.986
He said, "They are extremely superficial,
this language is superficial,

00:26:44.065 --> 00:26:48.491
they don't know about anything about Spirit
or anything about Kundalini."

00:26:48.547 --> 00:26:51.882
And he was a very well read man very deep person

00:26:51.936 --> 00:26:56.195
and he told Me that while he was studying

00:26:56.895 --> 00:27:01.941
gradually he felt this Mahasaraswati Principle
the way he didn't say Mahasaraswati339

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:05.056
but he felt there must be subtler knowledge subtler knowledge.

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:09.162
So he took to books like Gita, this, that, and

00:27:09.289 --> 00:27:12.491
then suddenly he felt that it's all reading again.

00:27:12.578 --> 00:27:16.503
It's just the same like translation
and specially when he translated Gita

00:27:16.556 --> 00:27:23.186
he was amazed that people were just reading it like Bible then.

00:27:23.417 --> 00:27:26.015
Then he said that "Mother, I don't know how

00:27:26.087 --> 00:27:29.594
but one day I was praying to Mother Mary and

00:27:29.716 --> 00:27:33.061
to the Holy Ghost and I got my realization."

00:27:33.231 --> 00:27:37.540
So he was a realized soul and he saw Me in dream, you see.

00:27:37.579 --> 00:27:41.326
He said, "In dream You came and gave me realization."
It's surprising.

00:27:41.466 --> 00:27:45.429
He saw Me in dream and he got ...
There's another few people who have got it, but

00:27:45.686 --> 00:27:47.855
specially him. I was so surprised so when

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:50.132
I arrived in his house he recognized Me immediately.

00:27:50.157 --> 00:27:51.605
He said, " I saw You in my dream.

00:27:51.637 --> 00:27:54.948
You came and gave me realization, You awakened my Kundalini 354

00:27:54.973 --> 00:27:56.595
and You gave me realization."

00:27:56.687 --> 00:28:01.336
So you can imagine that this gentleman was so beautifully

00:28:01.456 --> 00:28:05.627
placed so subtle, he was that at the Agya point.

00:28:05.652 --> 00:28:08.559
He just got the dream and he got realization.

00:28:08.669 --> 00:28:12.697
And he said, "All the knowledge is now revealed to me so much more."

00:28:12.809 --> 00:28:14.839
And then he sat down with Me.

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:18.172
And he said, "Can you stay for some time?"
I said, "I am now going away."

00:28:18.259 --> 00:28:21.463
But at least for five hours he was talking to Me.

00:28:21.574 --> 00:28:23.518
He was not tired, he would not leave Me.

00:28:23.626 --> 00:28:27.714
Such an old man was sitting at My feet.
I was telling him, "You sit on the chair."

00:28:27.739 --> 00:28:31.418
"'No, I'm very good. I'm very much all right You sitting there."

00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:36.938
So this is what happens with this
Mahasaraswati Principle developing within us.

00:28:36.994 --> 00:28:39.605
But we should allow that to grow within us.

00:28:39.716 --> 00:28:43.927
So in Sahaja Yoga we are not told that
we are not to read any book, not at all.

00:28:43.952 --> 00:28:48.108
We have to read, but in that book we have to see the subtle points

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:53.009
and see for yourself. I don't read any scriptures,
because I don't need to read.

00:28:53.089 --> 00:28:58.199
But when I started reading the, you see, these intellectuals,

00:28:58.224 --> 00:29:01.763
what they have to say, I was amazed
that they are saying the same thing.

00:29:01.796 --> 00:29:06.755
There's nothing new. What I know,
what I say, that's what they are saying.

00:29:06.835 --> 00:29:10.529
There's nothing new about it; there's nothing special about it.

00:29:10.609 --> 00:29:12.946
Just what all the scriptures have said,

00:29:13.002 --> 00:29:16.910
they have said the same thing,
and these people are saying the same thing.

00:29:17.084 --> 00:29:21.416
But by saying these things, how are they going to propagate?

00:29:21.832 --> 00:29:26.142
Nothing. It will be just again something that will happen outside

00:29:26.245 --> 00:29:29.575
and it will drop out.

00:29:29.734 --> 00:29:32.376
It doesn't become part and part of yourself,

00:29:32.448 --> 00:29:36.253
so it has to become innate. That's only possible

00:29:36.278 --> 00:29:39.694
if your Spirit comes into your attention.

00:29:39.734 --> 00:29:41.345
There's no other way out.

00:29:41.435 --> 00:29:44.137
So luckily you all are realized souls

00:29:44.201 --> 00:29:47.743
and your Mahasaraswati is very much there,

00:29:47.828 --> 00:29:49.747
but I would say you must read.

00:29:49.843 --> 00:29:52.636
Read books of value and understand

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:57.000
how it is absolute Sahaja Yoga there, how it is there.

00:29:57.079 --> 00:30:00.678
Anything you take up you'll be surprised that

00:30:00.875 --> 00:30:03.221
all these books are talking about Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:03.261 --> 00:30:07.380
May not be all of it, but part of the Sahaja Yoga is there.

00:30:07.507 --> 00:30:11.902
All of them talk of some part of Sahaja Yoga
but not the whole of it,

00:30:11.934 --> 00:30:13.954
because they came at different times.

00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:16.481
And now the Sahaja Yoga is the time when

00:30:16.537 --> 00:30:20.873
you have to know the complete, integrated knowledge of this

00:30:21.477 --> 00:30:25.377
religious thought that was there. Complete integrated.

00:30:25.447 --> 00:30:29.279
And that's how you understand that all religions are integrated.

00:30:29.435 --> 00:30:32.356
So one should, in Sahaja Yoga, after you come, people

00:30:32.412 --> 00:30:34.419
don't take to any reading.  Is a wrong thing.

00:30:34.444 --> 00:30:40.499
They should read and understand
what others have said, where have they gone wrong.

00:30:40.586 --> 00:30:42.586
But not these nonsensical people.

00:30:42.686 --> 00:30:47.219
You shouldn't read these nonsensical people
which you know are nonsensical.

00:30:47.264 --> 00:30:51.786
But so many, the other day I got this book of the Christian Science.

00:30:51.799 --> 00:30:54.776
It's all Bible nothing special about it.

00:30:54.969 --> 00:30:58.578
They are saying you should not do this;
you should not do this, and all that.

00:30:58.610 --> 00:31:02.869
It's all written in the Bible.
What new things are you telling? Nothing.

00:31:03.108 --> 00:31:06.255
You don't need a science for that. It's just there.

00:31:06.326 --> 00:31:10.924
But they are making money out of it by explaining and this and this.

00:31:10.949 --> 00:31:12.604
No explanation needed.

00:31:12.672 --> 00:31:17.279
Because that has to come within yourself
is the point which is not there.

00:31:17.612 --> 00:31:21.954
So now, this Mahaswaraswati Principle is awakened within us

00:31:22.002 --> 00:31:29.531
and we have to read and see
the subtle side of this growth of thought,

00:31:29.658 --> 00:31:33.298
how it grew up and how it became subtler and subtler,

00:31:33.478 --> 00:31:37.415
and how so many people in the world have contributed to it.

00:31:37.487 --> 00:31:44.403
So many artists, so many musicians and so many, we can say,

00:31:44.705 --> 00:31:51.190
writers who have really contributed to the central path of Sushumna416

00:31:51.277 --> 00:31:55.157
because they became realized souls.
They were realized souls.

00:31:55.189 --> 00:32:02.486
Some were born, and some became,
and then they completely wrote about the yoga.

00:32:02.573 --> 00:32:06.515
For example Rabindranath Tagore, in the beginning he writes,

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:09.486
"How, when will I meet you my friend?" and all that.

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:12.714
What you call the separation song, [INAUDIBLE] yoga.

00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:17.327
And then after some time, suddenly he gets his realization,

00:32:17.406 --> 00:32:19.978
because he becomes subtler and subtler and subtler.

00:32:20.034 --> 00:32:25.001
Then he writes about his meeting,

00:32:25.085 --> 00:32:28.030
his meeting the Spirit and he writes about it.

00:32:28.165 --> 00:32:32.344
So these things work out in such a manner for some people

00:32:32.447 --> 00:32:38.543
that by their subtleties they arrive at a point of realization.

00:32:38.614 --> 00:32:40.720
Same thing happened with Buddha.

00:32:40.752 --> 00:32:44.061
He did the same thing. He renounced everything,

00:32:44.086 --> 00:32:48.791
renounced His family went out, read Upanishads this, that.

00:32:48.871 --> 00:32:52.642
Everything He read and ultimately reached Gaya

00:32:52.667 --> 00:32:57.028
where He was sleeping under a banyan tree.

00:32:57.211 --> 00:33:03.217
And while sleeping only, He was so tired and fed up,

00:33:03.962 --> 00:33:10.086
He got his realization. And that's what is very important.

00:33:10.118 --> 00:33:14.659
But for the Buddhists what He did before going there is important.

00:33:14.707 --> 00:33:19.461
So they also want to also renounce this
and become sanyasis, this, that.

00:33:19.486 --> 00:33:23.300
But by becoming that, nothing is going to happen. It's going to Gaya

00:33:23.325 --> 00:33:27.086
and sleeping there also won't happen.
It has to happen because

00:33:27.134 --> 00:33:33.075
He was a pure seeker, true seeker and that's why it happened.

00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:38.524
But for Sahaja Yogis, they don't have to do
anything of the kind they just get it, realization.

00:33:38.563 --> 00:33:44.559
Because I think most of them in their last lives
have crossed most of their problems,

00:33:44.584 --> 00:33:48.215
and have known that it's nothing,
it's all nonsense in all these things.

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:51.974
Or maybe in this life also
they must have realized it's all nonsense.

00:33:51.999 --> 00:33:55.416
And then they must have come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:55.518 --> 00:34:02.650
So it's a very great luck for you that you are here
and you've got your realization

00:34:02.841 --> 00:34:04.614
and that you are enjoying yourself.

00:34:04.653 --> 00:34:07.828
May God bless you!

00:34:18.775 --> 00:34:24.484
Another side which I have left over is the
political side - on the right side, you see.

00:34:24.587 --> 00:34:31.683
Even in politics, the growth becomes subtler and subtler.

00:34:31.810 --> 00:34:36.911
Like in say, we can say, in Russia

00:34:37.046 --> 00:34:41.012
when it was such a power-oriented thing. It's not money-oriented.

00:34:41.108 --> 00:34:44.966
The Communism was so power-oriented it reached a place that

00:34:44.998 --> 00:34:47.946
person like Gorbachev was to be born

00:34:48.217 --> 00:34:54.265
who would put it in a proper sense, and he came on a central path.

00:34:54.299 --> 00:34:59.537
He didn't want complete democracy
as it is in America, it's a demonocracy,

00:34:59.706 --> 00:35:01.845
but he wanted a balanced thing.

00:35:01.901 --> 00:35:05.259
So far he has not been able to manage, but I'm sure one day

00:35:05.284 --> 00:35:09.930
he will be managed, but he will be known
all over the world for his great,

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:18.335
great thought and great work of reducing the pressure

00:35:18.406 --> 00:35:23.921
between the two great,or say between the two ideologists.

00:35:24.032 --> 00:35:28.292
And he's done such a good thing that now there's no war,

00:35:28.346 --> 00:35:32.740
going to be no war, as I mean not a very big world war

00:35:32.765 --> 00:35:34.378
but could be little bit here and there.

00:35:34.426 --> 00:35:38.303
That also is coming up which is a problem of fundamentalism,

00:35:38.328 --> 00:35:40.866
is not due to political but fundamentalism.

00:35:41.061 --> 00:35:43.888
So now the problem today is fundamentalism

00:35:43.936 --> 00:35:46.768
and that also comes from the right side, absolutely.

00:35:46.987 --> 00:35:51.397
Fundamentalists are all right-sided people and this right-sidedness

00:35:51.456 --> 00:35:56.520
takes them to any extreme of violence could be or,

00:35:56.679 --> 00:36:01.286
in some cases, it's really crazy and madness.

00:36:01.418 --> 00:36:05.302
But a new disease has started now those who go too much to the right

00:36:05.362 --> 00:36:08.892
is called as a yuppies disease where the whole

00:36:08.917 --> 00:36:13.480
conscious mind goes out of order and you become like a reptile.

00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:18.979
I've seen people being carried like big fishes
on the shoulders you see

00:36:19.004 --> 00:36:24.191
and put in a seat and they just know everything,
by brain is all right.

00:36:24.279 --> 00:36:28.233
But they understand everything. They can talk well

00:36:28.297 --> 00:36:33.821
but they cannot move their hands,
cannot move their feet if they want to.

00:36:33.891 --> 00:36:36.174
Unconsciously they may, but consciously they cannot,

00:36:36.206 --> 00:36:41.139
and this disease is the one which is a warning to everyone.

00:36:41.798 --> 00:36:46.491
So we have be careful in Sahaja Yoga also,
we should not go too much to the right

00:36:46.516 --> 00:36:50.504
is also very dangerous, too.
Some people become very fanatic and

00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:54.051
start teaching Sahaja Yoga in a very fanatical manner

00:36:54.083 --> 00:36:58.252
and sort of you see, make a ... I don't know what to call that.

00:36:58.347 --> 00:37:01.597
But sometimes I see some people speaking in a manner

00:37:01.622 --> 00:37:05.182
that one should never speak that way because we are Sahaja Yogis.

00:37:05.207 --> 00:37:11.035
The main thing is love, compassion,

00:37:11.908 --> 00:37:19.581
which is a living force and
must be done everything, with that force,

00:37:20.454 --> 00:37:28.934
which is a beautiful, living force which creates these flowers,

00:37:29.096 --> 00:37:33.289
which does all kinds of beautiful constructive things.

00:37:33.345 --> 00:37:42.153
It should not be in any way a oppression, domination

00:37:43.931 --> 00:37:48.233
or in any kind of command. You should not do like this,

00:37:48.273 --> 00:37:51.359
and organization, nothing of the kind.

00:37:51.423 --> 00:37:56.501
It is something so spontaneous, so beautiful, just works out.

00:37:56.805 --> 00:38:01.344
But as these trees have to be embedded in the Mother Earth,

00:38:01.392 --> 00:38:06.243
in the same way you should be embedded
in the principle of Sahaja Yoga

00:38:06.268 --> 00:38:10.574
which is compassion, love, and divine grace.

00:38:10.616 --> 00:38:15.394
If it is not there, then you'll have problems with leadership
and you'll have problems with ...

00:38:15.419 --> 00:38:19.163
Anybody who's a violent person cannot stay in Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:19.209 --> 00:38:22.931
He has to disappear. Either he should change himself entirely

00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:27.145
or he has to disappear. It doesn't work out
with people who are violent.

00:38:27.307 --> 00:38:31.645
So one has to understand that you may be in any position,

00:38:31.677 --> 00:38:36.854
you may be anywhere, you may be a very poor person,

00:38:36.879 --> 00:38:40.279
you may be very rich but makes no difference for a Sahaja Yogi.

00:38:40.304 --> 00:38:44.467
The best thing to judge yourself is that

00:38:44.547 --> 00:38:48.600
whenever we are doing anything for anyone or saying anything,

00:38:48.625 --> 00:38:53.567
is it benevolent or is it violent?

00:38:54.565 --> 00:39:03.134
Is it for our self-propagation or self,

00:39:04.450 --> 00:39:10.874
holier-than-thou sort of a principle
or it is for the goodness of others?

00:39:11.429 --> 00:39:15.833
Once you start judging like that, you'll be amazed that

00:39:16.031 --> 00:39:19.562
your whole system will change,

00:39:19.658 --> 00:39:23.610
your way of talking, your way of working it out.

00:39:23.681 --> 00:39:27.020
For example today you see there was a lady
who wouldn't allow Me to talk at all.

00:39:27.045 --> 00:39:30.706
She was talking all the time about something
which was not important.

00:39:30.762 --> 00:39:34.805
But still I was working it out because I knew that
there's no need to talk now.

00:39:34.932 --> 00:39:36.952
With this gentleman I can work it out.

00:39:37.016 --> 00:39:42.918
So it is always so that you should try to see the whole thing

00:39:43.085 --> 00:39:48.756
as a complete play and take a very,

00:39:57.303 --> 00:40:00.745
a witness state, in a witness state you should watch.

00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:03.712
If you watch everything in a witness state

00:40:03.768 --> 00:40:09.428
then you can handle the whole situation very nicely,

00:40:09.568 --> 00:40:13.618
even if you do not talk, if you do not say anything still

00:40:13.633 --> 00:40:17.056
in a witness state you become very powerful,

00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:22.484
and in that witness state you can easily solve lots of problems.

00:40:23.099 --> 00:40:25.730
May God bless you!
