00:00.060 --> 00:03.000
Shri Guru Puja. Cabella Ligure (Italy), 04 July 1993.

08:54.300 --> 08:59.220
Today we are going to have Guru Puja.

09:01.450 --> 09:05.060
I’m supposed to be your guru,

09:07.740 --> 09:15.580
but I feel sometimes that the idea of a guru

09:15.960 --> 09:20.110
is very different from Mine.

09:22.790 --> 09:28.310
Normally, a guru is a very, very strict person

09:28.870 --> 09:32.580
and has no patience of any kind.

09:34.380 --> 09:42.210
Even, say music, there are gurus who teach music in India,

09:44.610 --> 09:52.790
so all the disciplines have to be absolutely followed.

09:54.350 --> 09:59.370
I know about this great musician, Ravi Shankar.

10:01.030 --> 10:04.560
We had been to Maihar where he came

10:06.550 --> 10:11.790
and my father was very much respected by his guru, Allahudin Khan.

10:11.990 --> 10:14.250
So he asked him, “Why don’t you play something.”

10:14.450 --> 10:16.430
So he didn’t tell him anything that time.

10:16.630 --> 10:22.260
Then he showed a big bump here. He said, “Sir, do you see this?”

10:22.460 --> 10:26.160
He said, “What?” “My own tanpura,

10:26.360 --> 10:34.440
he broke on my head because I was little bit out of tune.”

10:36.150 --> 10:38.620
Otherwise, he was a very nice man, I must say.

10:38.820 --> 10:44.010
I knew Allahudin Khan sahab, but when it came to teaching,

10:47.190 --> 10:49.910
it’s a tradition I think

10:51.140 --> 10:58.730
that you have to put all kinds of disciplines on the students,

11:02.190 --> 11:04.470
but still the students stick on to the guru.

11:04.670 --> 11:08.870
They look after all the time. They’re bothered with the guru.

11:09.070 --> 11:13.530
He wants this thing, they’ll run. If he wants this, they’ll do.

11:14.850 --> 11:22.870
A guru goes on taking different types of tests of the disciple.

11:23.850 --> 11:26.720
Like Shivaji’s guru asked him that

11:26.920 --> 11:32.510
“I would like drink the milk of a tigress.”

11:34.260 --> 11:35.960
So he said, “All right.”

11:36.160 --> 11:39.680
If my guru has said it, it is his lookout.

11:40.000 --> 11:46.190
So went to the forest and he saw a tigress sitting there.

11:46.680 --> 11:51.010
She had already finished giving milk to her cubs,

11:51.210 --> 11:55.410
so he bowed before the tigress and he said,

11:55.950 --> 11:58.800
“See, my guru wants your milk.

11:59.250 --> 12:02.430
Will you please give some milk for my guru?”

12:02.630 --> 12:04.560
And the tigress understood it.

12:04.760 --> 12:10.680
She stood up and he took out the milk of the tigress for the guru.

12:11.020 --> 12:16.220
So, in this, one can see in the obedience of the guru,

12:16.620 --> 12:21.570
one achieves even the impossible things.

12:24.000 --> 12:30.740
Another time his guru said that he has got a big boil on his leg

12:31.320 --> 12:37.110
and that it is all right and anybody who will suck it,

12:39.320 --> 12:41.570
so has to be my disciple

12:41.770 --> 12:45.130
and my disciple, when he sucks it, I will be all right.

12:45.330 --> 12:50.190
Everybody was so averse to a thing like that.

12:50.910 --> 12:54.320
Shivaji maharaj said, “Of course I will suck it.”

12:54.520 --> 12:57.110
He bend down. And he started sucking it

12:57.310 --> 13:03.450
from the bandage that was there and it was a mango.

13:05.740 --> 13:13.160
So there are two, three types of tests are all the time taken

13:14.870 --> 13:22.310
of the disciple. Firstly, how much they obey you.

13:26.330 --> 13:34.910
But, as you all have got Realization and you are your own gurus,

13:36.320 --> 13:41.180
I don’t put that condition on you.

13:43.460 --> 13:49.480
I leave it to your freedom. I tell you earnestly,

13:51.230 --> 13:56.690
in all the way possible, what I think good for you,

13:58.500 --> 14:08.050
but I don’t compel like these gurus used to do.

14:08.250 --> 14:15.360
I mean, they used to beat. They used to hang them on the well.

14:18.050 --> 14:21.110
They were so very strict

14:21.310 --> 14:25.540
with their disciples and I’ve had an experience of this.

14:27.070 --> 14:31.910
They never used to smile. No question of laughing.

14:34.200 --> 14:40.390
And would never show any kind of weakness

14:40.590 --> 14:43.750
of kindness for the disciples.

14:45.110 --> 14:48.350
This is about the spiritual gurus I am telling you,

14:48.550 --> 14:55.110
but those who wanted their ascent, wanted their Realization

14:56.290 --> 15:01.230
would go on passing through all kinds of tortures

15:01.450 --> 15:03.720
that they put on them.

15:05.470 --> 15:08.480
Some of the gurus who didn’t like some disciples,

15:09.220 --> 15:10.930
they would tell them, “All right,

15:11.130 --> 15:14.450
you now stand on your one leg all the time.”

15:15.450 --> 15:19.860
So they’re standing on one leg like a crane.

15:21.680 --> 15:28.220
Another one, they would say that “you stand on your head.”

15:32.830 --> 15:41.040
The way they used to treat their disciples

15:42.980 --> 15:48.950
was rather difficult for Me. I can’t do it.

15:53.760 --> 16:00.270
All the time the compassion becomes the tears in My eyes.

16:00.470 --> 16:07.340
I find it impossible. I may just say it in a way,

16:07.690 --> 16:15.810
sometimes also, say it in a way that looks like little scolding,

16:16.850 --> 16:21.360
but to be a Mother and to be a guru is the most difficult thing.

16:26.930 --> 16:33.680
I do not know what comes first, but, of course, every mother wants

16:33.880 --> 16:40.200
her child to be good and the Holy Mother wants

16:40.400 --> 16:43.290
Her child to be a holy person.

16:45.350 --> 16:48.640
The first thing is the holiness.

16:49.280 --> 16:55.020
Now for that, how can you compel someone?

16:59.590 --> 17:07.500
Only thing that makes you understand is this

17:09.580 --> 17:17.840
that if you don’t become holy, how will you get your ascent?

17:20.990 --> 17:23.040
We have to be holy.

17:25.150 --> 17:29.890
What discipline one can put for making a person holy?

17:32.290 --> 17:37.490
What can you force? What can you get angry for?

17:42.460 --> 17:46.200
Only method I use normally is to forgive.

17:49.130 --> 17:54.260
Maybe the forgiveness is the highest quality, I think,

17:54.460 --> 17:56.240
for teaching people.

17:59.820 --> 18:03.790
When they know that they have done wrong and they confess it,

18:03.990 --> 18:06.510
then you have to forgive.

18:08.480 --> 18:13.110
Like in the life of Buddha, there was a man

18:14.820 --> 18:23.630
who was abusing him

18:25.940 --> 18:28.620
without understanding

18:28.820 --> 18:35.730
and when he finished with his abuses and Buddha had left,

18:35.930 --> 18:38.970
people told him, “Do you know whom you were abusing?”

18:39.170 --> 18:44.130
It was Lord Buddha. Got a fright of his life.

18:45.140 --> 18:49.220
He said, “Where is he gone?” “He has gone to another village.”

18:49.510 --> 18:52.660
So he went to another village and he said, “Sir,

18:52.860 --> 18:56.980
I am sorry for what I said. Please forgive me. It’s all wrong

19:01.940 --> 19:06.770
and I should not have done it. You can punish me the way you like.”

19:07.950 --> 19:10.500
Lord Buddha said, “When did you do that?”

19:10.700 --> 19:14.400
He said, “Yesterday.” He said, “I don’t know yesterday.

19:14.600 --> 19:16.420
I know only today.”

19:20.030 --> 19:22.480
You see, even you tell these things,

19:22.680 --> 19:25.030
how great one feels, isn’t it?

19:25.810 --> 19:30.250
So your greatness, your nobility

19:32.350 --> 19:36.110
will definitely influence people.

19:36.840 --> 19:40.780
It’s not by fighting, by quarrelling,

19:40.980 --> 19:46.340
by saying harsh things it is going to work out.

19:48.960 --> 19:55.140
Also the gurus used to control the children very much,

19:55.410 --> 20:00.320
the disciples very much, absolutely control.

20:01.170 --> 20:05.210
You have to get up at four o’clock, sit down for meditation.

20:05.410 --> 20:08.760
If you have not got up, they would beat.

20:11.720 --> 20:14.240
I can’t understand. Sahaja

20:17.360 --> 20:20.180
Yoga is very different

20:22.570 --> 20:31.260
from all other gurus that we believe in the power of love.

20:36.750 --> 20:41.860
Power of love teaches you how to be forgiving.

20:44.540 --> 20:46.800
It makes you noble.

20:49.660 --> 20:54.960
It makes you very balanced.

20:57.620 --> 21:02.200
So the gurus who were there for bhavasagara

21:03.650 --> 21:10.100
to establish dharma in the human beings,

21:14.040 --> 21:17.440
first thing, they had to balance themselves

21:19.790 --> 21:26.840
against all practical things, as they call it.

21:28.420 --> 21:30.820
They think it is not practical,

21:32.470 --> 21:42.550
but they said, “No, for us, this is higher, nobler and important.”

21:44.650 --> 21:47.160
So they would balance people

21:47.360 --> 21:52.380
because they had this power of love within themselves.

21:53.900 --> 21:57.820
All these Adi Gurus and their incarnations, if you see them,

21:58.040 --> 22:06.760
they always had balance and always praised the love of God.

22:13.050 --> 22:23.190
When we talk about Realization, one has to know, first of all,

22:23.390 --> 22:27.080
that we have to have patience with ourselves.

22:29.030 --> 22:33.680
I know some people don’t feel so good,

22:34.860 --> 22:37.810
some people still have sicknesses.

22:38.300 --> 22:42.390
Some people don’t even feel vibrations sometimes.

22:44.330 --> 22:47.280
Have patience with yourself.

22:47.480 --> 22:50.110
When you become your own guru, first thing,

22:50.310 --> 22:56.360
as the guru has patience with his or her disciple,

22:56.560 --> 22:59.710
you must have patience with yourself.

23:04.360 --> 23:13.050
In that patience, you will learn that you can tolerate

23:14.730 --> 23:17.720
so many things without any trouble.

23:20.050 --> 23:22.840
They say one person who goes on grudging,

23:23.050 --> 23:26.150
“Oh, this is not good. That is not good”

23:31.610 --> 23:35.500
because they have no patience with themselves.

23:36.650 --> 23:42.970
If you have patience with yourself, everything you’ll accept.

23:45.700 --> 23:48.050
Wherever you are, you are with yourself

23:48.250 --> 23:50.520
because you’re realized souls.

23:50.720 --> 23:56.440
So you won’t frustrate, you’ll not get angry

24:01.400 --> 24:05.650
and also you’ll not go on grumbling and grudging

24:06.340 --> 24:09.150
because you’re enjoying yourself.

24:10.570 --> 24:14.600
Even if there’s a mattress, all right.

24:14.810 --> 24:16.940
If there isn’t, you can sleep on the grass.

24:17.140 --> 24:19.650
If there’s no grass, you can sleep on the stone.

24:19.850 --> 24:23.400
And also you need not sleep like last night,

24:25.720 --> 24:28.500
makes no difference whatsoever.

24:31.370 --> 24:33.160
The first thing I find with people,

24:33.400 --> 24:36.610
they have no patience with themselves.

24:38.270 --> 24:42.730
Firstly, maybe, because they’re conditioned.

24:42.930 --> 24:45.560
Say, if you have a left Vishuddhi,

24:45.760 --> 24:50.110
by any chance you have been a Catholic or T.M. or something,

24:51.810 --> 24:54.440
then all the time you start pitying yourself,

24:54.640 --> 24:57.480
thinking no end of your miseries and troubles

24:57.680 --> 25:00.930
and always try to condemn yourself.

25:01.130 --> 25:03.210
You are a realized soul

25:03.670 --> 25:08.200
and you have no business to condemn yourself, no business.

25:14.050 --> 25:17.580
Like a person who’s getting drowned, has been saved,

25:17.780 --> 25:21.500
has come to the shore, now is doing nicely,

25:23.400 --> 25:25.970
has got his second life

25:26.440 --> 25:32.120
and there he’s still trying to express his agony,

25:32.320 --> 25:34.960
as if he’s getting drowned.

25:36.820 --> 25:41.230
So you have to awaken yourself. “No, no, no more I am there.

25:41.430 --> 25:46.790
I’m finished. It’s gone now. I am different.

25:47.410 --> 25:52.200
That was somebody else. I am not the same person.”

25:53.190 --> 25:57.900
This is how you have to tell yourself very clearly

25:58.100 --> 26:01.380
that “I am not going to condemn myself.”

26:06.120 --> 26:10.780
It was your right to get Self Realization. You got it.

26:14.060 --> 26:18.190
And then you cannot enjoy it because you have these conditionings,

26:18.390 --> 26:23.230
especially in the West to be miserable, it is very fashionable.

26:26.060 --> 26:30.570
There are miseries of people who have no miseries.

26:43.140 --> 26:51.980
So, for such people who have imaginary miseries of the past,

26:52.180 --> 26:54.570
which do not exist in reality,

26:54.770 --> 26:59.020
they cannot have the joy of reality. They cannot.

27:01.750 --> 27:09.520
So, for a Sahaja Yogi, it’s important that he should have joy

27:16.810 --> 27:21.880
within his heart. It’s like an ocean.

27:23.040 --> 27:31.580
It’s like an ocean which is there all the time

27:35.490 --> 27:41.130
to give you such thrills.

27:44.520 --> 27:50.490
Even little drops of this ocean,

27:51.870 --> 27:58.330
when they trickle down in your being, it is so soothing.

27:59.620 --> 28:03.650
The experience can be only experienced.

28:06.940 --> 28:10.970
It’s all waiting within yourself.

28:19.230 --> 28:23.820
And such a person also makes others joyous.

28:26.310 --> 28:30.770
He cannot see another person unhappy, in trouble.

28:32.200 --> 28:40.230
Himself is full of joy and spreads joy all around.

28:41.420 --> 28:44.800
You can get joy from small, small things

28:45.640 --> 28:48.140
because you have the ocean

28:49.210 --> 28:51.400
and a little thing that drops into the ocean

28:51.600 --> 28:56.110
creates such beautiful ripples. They touch the shores,

28:58.210 --> 29:02.130
not only of your own being, but of others.

29:03.550 --> 29:10.100
Very, very small things make you so very happy

29:11.620 --> 29:13.880
and that all the time

29:14.080 --> 29:17.770
you are just like a surfing, as they call it these days,

29:17.970 --> 29:23.070
on this beautiful lake or a beautiful ocean of love.

29:25.480 --> 29:30.390
Love is joy-giving. It’s not carnal love.

29:31.850 --> 29:34.940
It is Divine Love.

29:35.490 --> 29:42.070
So, as Sahaja Yogis and as gurus, we have to love ourselves

29:42.800 --> 29:45.090
and understand our own value.

29:45.290 --> 29:50.750
I think Sahaja Yogis have not yet understood their value.

29:50.950 --> 29:55.100
How many people in this world can give Realization?

29:58.840 --> 30:02.400
How many know about kundalini?

30:03.870 --> 30:10.990
How many have seen people being resurrected all the time?

30:15.500 --> 30:20.580
You are made so powerful

30:24.700 --> 30:28.690
that even looking at people, you can give Realization.

30:37.310 --> 30:41.410
In ordinary love, in carnal love people have fear.

30:43.280 --> 30:49.320
They’re afraid that their beloved might depart

30:49.520 --> 30:53.000
or might get sick, might happen this

30:55.970 --> 31:04.250
and they might all the time be under fear, resist enjoying.

31:07.070 --> 31:15.320
But, for you, you are with yourself and you are always protected.

31:21.010 --> 31:28.960
If your attention is bad for a second even,

31:29.160 --> 31:32.510
immediately you know you are going wrong.

31:32.710 --> 31:35.750
You protect yourself from yourself.

31:40.280 --> 31:45.080
As soon as you get some physical problem, you can feel it.

31:45.280 --> 31:47.930
You know how to cure yourself.

31:49.590 --> 31:53.020
But again, one has to have balance.

31:53.950 --> 31:57.000
If you’re off the balance,

31:57.630 --> 32:00.670
then you don’t even feel vibrations,

32:01.000 --> 32:04.970
you don’t even feel what’s wrong with you.

32:05.170 --> 32:08.520
You don’t know which direction you are moving,

32:08.720 --> 32:11.530
whether you are getting destroyed.

32:12.580 --> 32:18.370
And this balance has to be established by all the Sahaja Yogis.

32:29.150 --> 32:36.460
These imbalances come to us because we still think about our past

32:36.660 --> 32:38.920
or maybe about our future.

32:40.640 --> 32:42.990
We worry about these things.

32:45.420 --> 32:49.940
What is there to worry when all the angels and all the ganas

32:50.140 --> 32:52.030
are working for you?

32:53.820 --> 32:56.870
You just have to order, that’s all.

32:59.200 --> 33:03.720
But it’s like sometimes a person is made a king

33:03.920 --> 33:10.510
and is put on a throne, but before that he was a beggar,

33:10.710 --> 33:14.090
so anybody who comes to bow before him, he says,

33:14.290 --> 33:18.350
“All right. Give me one pound.”

33:22.200 --> 33:25.500
You have to know that you are all realized souls

33:25.700 --> 33:29.620
and that you have all the powers within you.

33:31.050 --> 33:35.230
Only thing which is very important is the balance.

33:36.510 --> 33:41.790
In Sahaja Yoga also people get into imbalances.

33:45.810 --> 33:54.720
How? Like I have seen people

33:56.960 --> 34:01.840
who are, say, afraid of these worldly laws.

34:05.850 --> 34:15.320
They don’t know there is such a powerful energy all around you.

34:19.670 --> 34:25.910
Nothing can stop you. Nothing can arrest you.

34:26.110 --> 34:28.490
Nothing can find faults.

34:28.690 --> 34:33.280
But when you start doubting, like yesterday’s doubting,

34:33.480 --> 34:36.440
when you say, “But, but.”

34:37.800 --> 34:43.720
When you start thinking about the man-made laws,

34:43.920 --> 34:46.500
then the God’s laws fail.

34:51.420 --> 34:54.440
Otherwise, nobody can punish you, nobody can arrest you,

34:54.640 --> 34:59.910
nobody can do anything to you. You are absolutely protected.

35:05.010 --> 35:12.940
So the main difference between the old style of guru

35:13.140 --> 35:16.980
and the modern style of guru is this

35:17.860 --> 35:22.730
that the old gurus used to you must suffer. All right,

35:22.930 --> 35:24.950
you have to be arrested is very good.

35:25.150 --> 35:28.140
If they give you poison, take the poison.

35:28.340 --> 35:31.240
If they want to slap you, take slaps.

35:31.440 --> 35:33.870
Whatever they want to do, you should accept

35:34.070 --> 35:36.350
because is your suffering.

35:36.550 --> 35:40.530
Not in Sahaja Yoga because your Mother is sitting here.

35:41.150 --> 35:43.660
How dare anybody touch you.

35:48.820 --> 35:53.700
No one can harm you. You have to believe Me when I say that.

35:54.380 --> 35:59.620
No one can harm you, but you must have that faith within yourself.

36:01.880 --> 36:05.800
Nobody had Adi Shakti as the Guru.

36:08.570 --> 36:12.540
Adi Shakti, the one who has all the powers of the world.

36:12.740 --> 36:18.460
So who can harm you? Who can torture you?

36:19.010 --> 36:21.010
Who can trouble you except for yourself?

36:21.210 --> 36:25.130
If you want to torture yourself, nobody can harm you.

36:28.020 --> 36:32.860
So the greatest difference between this disciple of other gurus

36:33.060 --> 36:37.080
and yourself is you don’t have to suffer.

36:40.030 --> 36:46.920
You are not to suffer and even, you see,

36:47.400 --> 36:50.240
if there’s somebody who has some negativity, that person,

36:50.440 --> 36:53.810
some Sahaja Yogis still carry on poor things they cannot help it

36:54.010 --> 36:57.000
they have been to wrong gurus or something.

36:57.310 --> 37:01.750
So they’ll meet with an accident,

37:02.330 --> 37:06.870
maybe they might face something terrible,

37:07.730 --> 37:11.150
but suddenly they’ll find they will get out of it.

37:11.350 --> 37:13.440
Maybe the negativity of somebody else,

37:13.640 --> 37:18.590
some relations, some brothers, sisters or maybe of the nation.

37:22.570 --> 37:25.100
But you’ll get out of it.

37:29.090 --> 37:33.260
It is a very remarkable thing in Sahaja Yoga

37:33.460 --> 37:37.480
that there are people who catching.

37:38.250 --> 37:42.540
“Mother, my heart is catching. My this is catching. That is catching.”

37:42.740 --> 37:47.440
But once they want to give Realization, just moves, kundalini moves.

37:48.420 --> 37:53.220
Whatever you may be, whatever may be your problems,

37:53.570 --> 37:56.770
but you raise your hand and kundalini moves.

37:57.640 --> 37:59.590
I mean, any instrument which is spoiled,

37:59.790 --> 38:02.400
say, supposing this fan is spoiled, it won’t work.

38:02.600 --> 38:06.720
But not Sahaja Yogis.

38:06.920 --> 38:13.880
They work out, of course,

38:14.080 --> 38:18.470
if they don’t practice Sahaja Yoga

38:18.670 --> 38:21.740
or if they don’t give Realizations to others,

38:21.940 --> 38:26.100
then, of course, it can be a junk then.

38:27.700 --> 38:30.600
Supposing you don’t use your car, may be very good

38:30.800 --> 38:33.940
and you don’t use it, it becomes a junk.

38:35.580 --> 38:40.170
So you have to give. You have to give Realization.

38:40.370 --> 38:43.450
All of you, whether it’s women or men.

38:44.720 --> 38:49.260
Whatever country you may belong, you have to give Realization,

38:49.460 --> 38:56.820
you have to allow this energy to go and work,

38:57.480 --> 39:03.810
otherwise it will suffocate.

39:05.160 --> 39:09.450
I’ve seen many Sahaja Yogis who have not done anything like that.

39:09.650 --> 39:13.270
They are very nice to you. Mother, we worship you at home.

39:13.470 --> 39:16.820
They suffer also from arthritis

39:19.710 --> 39:23.620
or other kinds of things,

39:24.650 --> 39:28.720
spondylitis’ sometimes they will have or

39:29.370 --> 39:33.300
they may have cellulitis or all kinds of things they can have.

39:33.900 --> 39:41.790
So you have to use your energy for giving Realizations to others.

39:45.110 --> 39:49.110
It’s all right, in protocol, if you don’t understand,

39:49.310 --> 39:51.010
you are forgiven.

39:51.720 --> 39:56.930
Anything you might do out of innocence or ignorance is forgiven.

39:58.550 --> 40:02.430
But knowingly, if you want to do something,

40:05.380 --> 40:08.240
then I don’t know repercussions

40:10.750 --> 40:15.620
because the area where you are is safe,

40:16.520 --> 40:20.340
but if you want to get out of that area,

40:22.690 --> 40:28.670
then all sides there are horrible negative forces working

40:28.870 --> 40:31.750
and you are captured into that.

40:32.710 --> 40:37.810
That’s not a mistake of Sahaja Yoga.

40:40.650 --> 40:46.360
To find faults with Sahaja Yogis or with Sahaja Yoga

40:46.810 --> 40:50.290
is another mistake we commit sometime.

40:51.890 --> 40:58.970
Say there are ten disciples with a guru, very good excellent guru,

40:59.770 --> 41:04.850
if they complain about any one of them,

41:08.190 --> 41:12.920
immediately the guru will say, “You get out.”

41:19.470 --> 41:24.240
They have no business to complain about each other.

41:25.990 --> 41:29.430
On the contrary, like this hand is paining,

41:29.630 --> 41:32.250
then this hand doesn’t complain to the brain,

41:32.450 --> 41:34.580
but tries to soothe it.

41:39.390 --> 41:48.850
So Sahaja Yogis are gurus who belong to the collective.

41:50.760 --> 41:54.910
They move in a group, as described by Gnyaneshwara,

41:55.640 --> 42:01.100
that you move now like the enlightened forest,

42:03.600 --> 42:09.840
which gives whatever people like, want to have, kalpatarus.

42:13.180 --> 42:21.650
And he said you move like oceans and talk about God.

42:22.190 --> 42:25.140
It’s not one single man standing and saying something.

42:25.340 --> 42:29.850
We saw yesterday in drama how a single man had to suffer.

42:32.210 --> 42:34.530
But you are in a group

42:36.650 --> 42:41.830
and all of you move in a group, together,

42:44.190 --> 42:46.440
with one understanding.

42:47.700 --> 42:50.590
Such a powerful group it is.

42:53.890 --> 42:59.590
They bring ambrosia to the people, according to Gnyaneshwara.

43:01.900 --> 43:08.180
But this power of collectivity that one feels

43:08.850 --> 43:11.890
is the first judgement of a person.

43:13.750 --> 43:21.800
Those who cannot be collective are not yet Sahaja Yogis.

43:25.550 --> 43:30.190
Some people think that they have served Me,

43:30.390 --> 43:35.210
they have looked after Me, they do My Puja or something,

43:35.890 --> 43:41.420
so that they have a right to scold others, to get angry with others,

43:41.620 --> 43:45.630
shout at them, tell them work, do all kinds of thing.

43:48.050 --> 43:49.720
It’s not so.

43:51.440 --> 43:55.230
You are a Sahaja Yogi when you are absolutely collective.

43:55.430 --> 44:00.380
Otherwise you are not a Sahaja Yogi when you are not collective.

44:02.390 --> 44:07.330
It’s so simple.

44:07.540 --> 44:13.310
That ego, the conditionings of ego

44:14.180 --> 44:21.860
or conditionings of the past may keep you away from others

44:22.140 --> 44:26.120
and there is no connection to the Divine any more left.

44:26.320 --> 44:28.350
Those who are not collective people

44:28.550 --> 44:31.470
have no relationship with the Divine.

44:36.650 --> 44:41.430
You have understood now what is collectivity is.

44:41.630 --> 44:47.520
Most surprising thing is for Me that by giving Realizations to you,

44:47.720 --> 44:54.830
I find it very easy to talk about subtlest of subtle things to you.

44:57.040 --> 45:01.490
All these things I don’t think any guru could have talked.

45:02.290 --> 45:06.630
Not possible. It would not go into their heads.

45:07.420 --> 45:12.120
Very subtle, it is. You have become subtle

45:12.980 --> 45:18.810
and the subtleties have their own beauty in expression,

45:19.030 --> 45:23.510
in expression, in talking,

45:23.710 --> 45:28.340
in behaving with others, in understanding.

45:28.540 --> 45:31.820
It’s so sweet and so beautiful.

45:34.620 --> 45:44.360
The collective feeling is something like

45:44.560 --> 45:52.650
a little particle of clay thinks it is a mountain,

45:55.080 --> 45:58.110
like a drop becoming the ocean.

46:00.030 --> 46:03.480
But if there’s one drop who says, “No, no, no. I can’t be collective.

46:03.680 --> 46:06.040
I stay on the shore.” All right,

46:06.250 --> 46:08.770
the sunshine will evaporate.

46:11.320 --> 46:16.580
“But, Mother, I worship you. I do this. I do that.”

46:17.550 --> 46:20.020
With all that, if you do not develop collectivity,

46:20.220 --> 46:22.120
better not worship Me.

46:25.180 --> 46:31.660
For that, how a guru should act with the collective?

46:35.250 --> 46:38.880
In Sahaja Yoga nobody should feel

46:39.710 --> 46:44.280
that you are some hierarchy or a higher personality.

46:44.980 --> 46:48.390
If you start feeling like that, then at that point,

46:48.590 --> 46:52.050
you must know that there is some possession on you.

46:58.790 --> 47:00.730
What is the highest in the water? Nothing.

47:00.930 --> 47:04.260
Everything is just the same. It’s the way it is there.

47:04.460 --> 47:09.630
It has to be used for its own purposes.

47:13.320 --> 47:20.090
And the cruelties sometimes people indulge into is unimaginable.

47:26.540 --> 47:32.170
How can this kind of satisfaction

47:32.370 --> 47:37.950
be there if you are Sahaja Yogis?

47:39.160 --> 47:42.450
I don’t know. They say so, that gurus used to beat

47:42.650 --> 47:48.080
and they used to do all kinds of things. There must be bhoots. No.

47:49.810 --> 47:54.970
A very angry gurus. You cannot afford to be angry.

47:55.170 --> 47:59.860
Cannot afford. Anger means imbalance.

48:01.550 --> 48:04.930
You get attached to, say, your family,

48:05.630 --> 48:09.360
start talking like that and no more.

48:13.580 --> 48:18.700
Attachment to anything shows you have no balance.

48:22.070 --> 48:26.840
Those who are balanced have to be detached.

48:30.320 --> 48:33.500
Otherwise you get attached to somebody.

48:33.700 --> 48:38.550
This is my daughter. This is my son. This is this.

48:38.750 --> 48:41.810
Then you don’t see the truth.

48:44.170 --> 48:46.810
So any kind of attachment,

48:50.660 --> 48:55.520
if you feel then know that you are not in balance.

48:58.210 --> 49:03.810
Also I’ve seen people get into a kind of a pride,

49:10.070 --> 49:12.940
pride that we are Sahaja Yogis.

49:16.680 --> 49:20.050
We have become Sahaja Yogis to save the whole world.

49:20.250 --> 49:23.350
It’s like I see so many government servants who think

49:23.550 --> 49:27.850
no end of themselves. They’re servants of the people.

49:30.560 --> 49:35.170
They may be called officers, but officers to serve.

49:36.660 --> 49:40.310
In the same way, we are in this world to serve God

49:40.510 --> 49:44.730
and the purpose of your service is to save the world,

49:45.860 --> 49:47.720
save the people.

49:48.610 --> 49:56.470
But if you have pride, false pride, how can you do that?

49:57.890 --> 50:03.070
The way you’ll talk, the way you’ll behave, nobody will come near.

50:09.850 --> 50:14.710
You cannot be jealous of another person, cannot be

50:20.500 --> 50:30.230
because jealousy means

50:30.440 --> 50:35.760
that you are trying to harm yourself really.

50:35.960 --> 50:40.010
I don’t know what jealousy is so much.

50:40.420 --> 50:43.070
I see people getting jealous,

50:43.270 --> 50:47.560
but I don’t know what it is really, jealousy.

50:47.760 --> 50:50.430
The funny stuff, isn’t it?

50:54.250 --> 50:59.920
It must be coming from animal kingdom maybe, I don’t know,

51:01.400 --> 51:06.520
because what is there to be jealous. I mean, you are realized souls.

51:12.940 --> 51:17.350
How can you be jealous of anyone?

51:17.550 --> 51:25.280
Say, supposing you are a diamond and another one is a diamond.

51:25.480 --> 51:30.630
Very good. Both put together will become even more brilliant.

51:32.820 --> 51:38.660
Now, supposing somebody is no good and you are very good,

51:40.810 --> 51:45.220
then there is nothing to feel jealous of the man who is no good.

51:45.420 --> 51:52.140
Or also somebody who is good, to feel jealous, what is your gain?

51:53.010 --> 51:56.160
If you think that gentleman is good or that lady’s good,

51:56.360 --> 52:01.390
better try to follow what she is doing, how is she good,

52:01.590 --> 52:04.560
how she has got this goodness.

52:08.560 --> 52:10.780
It’s better to study.

52:12.820 --> 52:17.420
I really enjoy the most when Sahaja Yogis start

52:18.540 --> 52:22.460
expressing their feelings about other Sahaja Yogis.

52:25.570 --> 52:29.330
“Mother, he’s like that. Mother, he’s like that.”

52:31.340 --> 52:34.630
So, they see the goodness of others.

52:34.830 --> 52:39.010
They see the greatness of others, the nobility of others

52:39.210 --> 52:42.890
and when you start seeing that, you start becoming.

52:48.190 --> 52:53.010
If you feel jealous, I mean,

52:53.320 --> 52:56.530
I don’t know what sort of a thing it is, as I told you.

52:56.730 --> 53:00.300
But you are condemning yourself permanently.

53:00.500 --> 53:04.110
Today you are jealous of somebody because he has black hair.

53:04.310 --> 53:07.330
You are jealous of somebody because he has grey hair.

53:07.530 --> 53:10.980
You’re jealous of somebody because he has got a long nose,

53:11.180 --> 53:15.000
jealous of somebody because he has got a short nose.

53:16.520 --> 53:19.270
[Shri Mataji speaks to a Sahaja Yogi:] What is happening?

53:19.470 --> 53:22.610
What happened? Ha?

53:27.900 --> 53:30.550
Are you a Sahaja Yogi?

53:30.750 --> 53:34.830
You are a Sahaja Yogi. Then you know the protocol. Let Me speak.

53:35.030 --> 53:37.360
All right? You can ask Me later on.

53:37.560 --> 53:41.430
This is not the way. This is not a parliament here.

53:41.630 --> 53:45.630
I know. I know that I don’t force any discipline,

53:45.830 --> 53:48.250
but this should be self discipline.

53:48.450 --> 53:51.370
You should be self-disciplined.

53:52.780 --> 53:55.310
I’m speaking just now. Listen to Me.

53:55.510 --> 53:59.720
Maybe I might answer you in My speech.

54:08.170 --> 54:17.380
So the relationship among yourselves

54:17.760 --> 54:24.040
cannot have anything to do with jealousy. Cannot.

54:25.920 --> 54:28.870
Because it kills your joy.

54:37.570 --> 54:44.640
Now, as I told you, that you get rid of your fear.

54:45.040 --> 54:47.880
You get rid of your jealousies.

54:48.120 --> 54:56.630
You get rid of your pride,

54:56.830 --> 54:59.230
false one.

54:59.430 --> 55:04.990
And also you get rid of your impatience.

55:08.220 --> 55:10.920
You must have patience.

55:11.120 --> 55:19.350
This is another style of guru

55:20.400 --> 55:24.430
who has patience, tremendous patience.

55:26.730 --> 55:30.980
Nothing to get angry, nothing to get upset.

55:32.000 --> 55:34.120
And gradually, you will see,

55:34.320 --> 55:38.090
without telling people, they will discipline themselves.

55:39.630 --> 55:43.330
It is you have to discipline yourself.

55:45.800 --> 55:50.840
In the system of Sahaja Yoga,

55:51.040 --> 55:55.810
we never had so many disciples.

55:56.730 --> 56:02.690
Imagine till Shri Gnyaneshwara, there was only one disciple

56:02.890 --> 56:05.210
and some of them never had any disciple,

56:05.410 --> 56:08.810
like William Blake, I don’t think had any disciple.

56:10.250 --> 56:12.020
Perhaps, they must have thought

56:12.220 --> 56:14.830
that nobody can come up to this level or understand.

56:15.030 --> 56:19.090
So many of them had no disciple.

56:19.290 --> 56:21.910
Sai Nath had no disciple.

56:22.110 --> 56:25.180
They came on this Earth or maybe they might be thinking

56:25.380 --> 56:29.270
useless people, what’s the use of having disciples?

56:33.190 --> 56:39.120
But, for you, it’s so great that we are so many of us together now,

56:39.320 --> 56:43.910
so many. We understand each other. We know each other.

56:44.880 --> 56:52.450
We know all about kundalini

56:52.650 --> 56:56.170
and  we are so aware about everything.

56:56.890 --> 56:59.030
We know what’s happening in this world.

56:59.230 --> 57:02.640
We are not just sitting in a cave in Himalayas

57:02.840 --> 57:06.500
and just we are doing, taking the name of God. No.

57:06.700 --> 57:12.720
We are in the world. We are not running away from the world.

57:12.920 --> 57:15.410
We are in this world.

57:16.950 --> 57:25.060
We are facing every day,

57:26.330 --> 57:29.620
every problem that is there.

57:29.820 --> 57:35.670
But we are in reality and they are in ignorance.

57:36.730 --> 57:42.540
That’s why we know, we know the solution,

57:44.450 --> 57:49.140
we know the problem and we can solve it.

57:50.730 --> 57:54.400
Now, you have to just experiment with your powers,

57:54.600 --> 57:59.450
of course with humility that I have to warn some people.

57:59.650 --> 58:03.980
See, they just sit on the horse, immediately I say that.

58:04.650 --> 58:08.660
First of all, you must know that you are a store of knowledge,

58:08.860 --> 58:11.020
complete store of knowledge

58:13.730 --> 58:20.160
about everything, except for bank, I would say.

58:21.570 --> 58:24.760
That’s the problem for Me.

58:31.210 --> 58:39.190
So you should have projection

58:41.810 --> 58:45.490
towards that source of knowledge.

58:47.620 --> 58:53.330
For example, everything can be interpreted in the Sahaj language.

58:54.320 --> 58:58.960
Everything. You see this pandal.

58:59.270 --> 59:02.350
It’s standing there because supported by this

59:02.550 --> 59:08.470
– just like Sahaja Yoga. We are supported by our dharma.

59:08.670 --> 59:10.160
Very simple thing like that.

59:10.360 --> 59:12.890
Everywhere you’ll find

59:13.090 --> 59:18.580
the comparison of Sahaja Yoga with everything else that you see.

59:21.880 --> 59:28.040
This is very important. That will give a double joy.

59:34.580 --> 59:38.200
The other day I was coming back

59:39.160 --> 59:48.000
and in the airport, it was I was perspiring,

59:48.200 --> 59:51.330
perspiring absolutely.

59:51.560 --> 59:54.310
And the Sahaja Yogi who was with Me, he said, “Mother,

59:54.510 --> 59:58.990
You are sucking all the heat of this place, the negativity.”

59:59.190 --> 01:00:02.200
It was a fact. But only a Sahaja Yogi can see.

01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:06.180
Everybody was sitting nicely. I was the one fanning Myself.

01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:09.090
Everybody was so comfortable, feeling the cool from Me

01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:11.830
and I was fanning Myself.

01:00:15.090 --> 01:00:18.530
One day it happened, I was going to a shop,

01:00:18.730 --> 01:00:20.750
all the Australian Sahaja Yogi following Me,

01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:25.080
in a Chinese shop. I don’t know what these Chinese do.

01:00:25.410 --> 01:00:28.990
Climbing up was feeling so hot and exhausted.

01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:34.220
I was just trying to soothe Myself.

01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:37.210
And they’re saying, “Mother, such cool coming from you.”

01:00:37.410 --> 01:00:39.520
I said, “Very nice.”

01:00:44.270 --> 01:00:49.330
I’m the one consuming all the heat and giving you all the cool.

01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:57.770
But that is what My job is,

01:00:58.020 --> 01:01:01.440
to take all the heat from everyone

01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:07.680
and transform it into something cooling and soothing.

01:01:09.010 --> 01:01:13.880
When people shout, scream, this, that.

01:01:14.090 --> 01:01:18.540
Peaceful, be peaceful and listen to them

01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:25.330
and then you can pour water on them completely

01:01:25.530 --> 01:01:28.100
and the whole heat can go away.

01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:31.740
So this absorption is very important.

01:01:31.940 --> 01:01:34.550
Not to be afraid of absorption.

01:01:34.750 --> 01:01:39.510
But, for that, I would say one should take care

01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:42.760
and the care, as you know, is a very simple thing, this Kavacha,

01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:49.000
is this bandhan that you have to take.

01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:56.080
For all this, whatever I have said, there’s one guru mantra,

01:01:57.050 --> 01:02:01.700
to remember that we are Sahaja Yogis.

01:02:02.830 --> 01:02:08.660
Just remember this. We are Sahaja Yogis.

01:02:11.250 --> 01:02:19.260
And once you know you are Sahaja Yogis, this projection will start.

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:24.010
What happened to William Blake? If you see,

01:02:24.210 --> 01:02:27.180
he started projecting his imagination

01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:31.780
and he reached the point of knowledge.

01:02:34.580 --> 01:02:39.420
So anything that you see, anything you do or others are doing,

01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:44.110
try to relate it with Sahaja Yoga and project.

01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:49.760
Then you will also reach the Ocean of Love.

01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:53.410
Once you have that, then what?

01:02:53.610 --> 01:02:56.220
Who can disturb you? Who can trouble you?

01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:59.060
Who can make anything that is difficult for you?

01:02:59.260 --> 01:03:02.240
Because you are sitting in the ocean, the fellow

01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:03.940
is sitting outside somewhere,

01:03:04.140 --> 01:03:07.210
how can it come into the ocean to trouble you?

01:03:09.310 --> 01:03:14.290
So this is what is to remember that you are a Sahaja Yogi.

01:03:14.850 --> 01:03:20.790
Take a bandhan morning and evening. It’s so simple.

01:03:20.990 --> 01:03:25.980
Even to say on the “my,” it seems stupid to Me.

01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:29.520
But, I have to say because people forget.

01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:32.170
You forget that you are realized souls.

01:03:32.370 --> 01:03:38.200
Use your vibratory awareness for at least protecting yourself

01:03:42.170 --> 01:03:45.440
because there is negativity sitting next to you.

01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:49.070
So be very careful about this, to remember that

01:03:49.270 --> 01:03:50.870
“I am a Sahaja Yogi.”

01:03:51.070 --> 01:03:53.880
Once you say that, you will know how you have to behave,

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:55.510
what is the protocol,

01:03:55.710 --> 01:03:58.530
you will know what is the discipline you have to follow,

01:03:58.730 --> 01:04:02.670
you’ll know how to love others, everything.

01:04:05.390 --> 01:04:07.550
This is the essence.

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:13.710
How many have been Sahaja Yogis before?

01:04:13.990 --> 01:04:16.400
Poor things, all these gurus suffered so much.

01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:18.610
You are not to suffer,

01:04:18.810 --> 01:04:24.990
not to go into any kind of a misery anymore, no more.

01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:29.130
But don’t forget you are Sahaja Yogis, that’s why.

01:04:29.540 --> 01:04:32.680
That will give you complete confidence in yourself and

01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:36.160
you’ll be absolutely secured.

01:04:37.530 --> 01:04:42.500
Try to establish the state that you are Sahaja Yogis.

01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:48.890
Thus, you become gurus of yourself and of others.

01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:51.590
May God bless you.
