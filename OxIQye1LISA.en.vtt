00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.000
Shri Guru Puja. Cabella Ligure (Italy), 04 July 1993.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:59.220
Today we are going to have Guru Puja.

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:05.060
I’m supposed to be your guru,

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:15.580
but I feel sometimes that the idea of a guru

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:20.110
is very different from Mine.

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:28.310
Normally, a guru is a very, very strict person

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:32.580
and has no patience of any kind.

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:42.210
Even, say music, there are gurus who teach music in India,

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:52.790
so all the disciplines have to be absolutely followed.

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:59.370
I know about this great musician, Ravi Shankar.

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:04.560
We had been to Maihar where he came

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:11.790
and my father was very much respected by his guru, Allahudin Khan.

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:14.250
So he asked him, “Why don’t you play something.”

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:16.430
So he didn’t tell him anything that time.

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:22.260
Then he showed a big bump here. He said, “Sir, do you see this?”

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:26.160
He said, “What?” “My own tanpura,

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:34.440
he broke on my head because I was little bit out of tune.”

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:38.620
Otherwise, he was a very nice man, I must say.

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:44.010
I knew Allahudin Khan sahab, but when it came to teaching,

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:49.910
it’s a tradition I think

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:58.730
that you have to put all kinds of disciplines on the students,

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:04.470
but still the students stick on to the guru.

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:08.870
They look after all the time. They’re bothered with the guru.

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:13.530
He wants this thing, they’ll run. If he wants this, they’ll do.

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:22.870
A guru goes on taking different types of tests of the disciple.

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:26.720
Like Shivaji’s guru asked him that

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:32.510
“I would like drink the milk of a tigress.”

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:35.960
So he said, “All right.”

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:39.680
If my guru has said it, it is his lookout.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:46.190
So went to the forest and he saw a tigress sitting there.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:51.010
She had already finished giving milk to her cubs,

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:55.410
so he bowed before the tigress and he said,

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:58.800
“See, my guru wants your milk.

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:02.430
Will you please give some milk for my guru?”

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:04.560
And the tigress understood it.

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:10.680
She stood up and he took out the milk of the tigress for the guru.

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:16.220
So, in this, one can see in the obedience of the guru,

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:21.570
one achieves even the impossible things.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:30.740
Another time his guru said that he has got a big boil on his leg

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:37.110
and that it is all right and anybody who will suck it,

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.570
so has to be my disciple

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:45.130
and my disciple, when he sucks it, I will be all right.

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:50.190
Everybody was so averse to a thing like that.

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:54.320
Shivaji maharaj said, “Of course I will suck it.”

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:57.110
He bend down. And he started sucking it

00:12:57.310 --> 00:13:03.450
from the bandage that was there and it was a mango.

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:13.160
So there are two, three types of tests are all the time taken

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:22.310
of the disciple. Firstly, how much they obey you.

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:34.910
But, as you all have got Realization and you are your own gurus,

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:41.180
I don’t put that condition on you.

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:49.480
I leave it to your freedom. I tell you earnestly,

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:56.690
in all the way possible, what I think good for you,

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:08.050
but I don’t compel like these gurus used to do.

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:15.360
I mean, they used to beat. They used to hang them on the well.

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:21.110
They were so very strict

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:25.540
with their disciples and I’ve had an experience of this.

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:31.910
They never used to smile. No question of laughing.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:40.390
And would never show any kind of weakness

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:43.750
of kindness for the disciples.

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:48.350
This is about the spiritual gurus I am telling you,

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:55.110
but those who wanted their ascent, wanted their Realization

00:14:56.290 --> 00:15:01.230
would go on passing through all kinds of tortures

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:03.720
that they put on them.

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:08.480
Some of the gurus who didn’t like some disciples,

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:10.930
they would tell them, “All right,

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:14.450
you now stand on your one leg all the time.”

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:19.860
So they’re standing on one leg like a crane.

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:28.220
Another one, they would say that “you stand on your head.”

00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:41.040
The way they used to treat their disciples

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:48.950
was rather difficult for Me. I can’t do it.

00:15:53.760 --> 00:16:00.270
All the time the compassion becomes the tears in My eyes.

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:07.340
I find it impossible. I may just say it in a way,

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:15.810
sometimes also, say it in a way that looks like little scolding,

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:21.360
but to be a Mother and to be a guru is the most difficult thing.

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:33.680
I do not know what comes first, but, of course, every mother wants

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:40.200
her child to be good and the Holy Mother wants

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.290
Her child to be a holy person.

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:48.640
The first thing is the holiness.

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:55.020
Now for that, how can you compel someone?

00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:07.500
Only thing that makes you understand is this

00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:17.840
that if you don’t become holy, how will you get your ascent?

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:23.040
We have to be holy.

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:29.890
What discipline one can put for making a person holy?

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:37.490
What can you force? What can you get angry for?

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:46.200
Only method I use normally is to forgive.

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:54.260
Maybe the forgiveness is the highest quality, I think,

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:56.240
for teaching people.

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:03.790
When they know that they have done wrong and they confess it,

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:06.510
then you have to forgive.

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:13.110
Like in the life of Buddha, there was a man

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:23.630
who was abusing him

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:28.620
without understanding

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:35.730
and when he finished with his abuses and Buddha had left,

00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:38.970
people told him, “Do you know whom you were abusing?”

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:44.130
It was Lord Buddha. Got a fright of his life.

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:49.220
He said, “Where is he gone?” “He has gone to another village.”

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:52.660
So he went to another village and he said, “Sir,

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:56.980
I am sorry for what I said. Please forgive me. It’s all wrong

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:06.770
and I should not have done it. You can punish me the way you like.”

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:10.500
Lord Buddha said, “When did you do that?”

00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:14.400
He said, “Yesterday.” He said, “I don’t know yesterday.

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:16.420
I know only today.”

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:22.480
You see, even you tell these things,

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:25.030
how great one feels, isn’t it?

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:30.250
So your greatness, your nobility

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:36.110
will definitely influence people.

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:40.780
It’s not by fighting, by quarrelling,

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:46.340
by saying harsh things it is going to work out.

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:55.140
Also the gurus used to control the children very much,

00:19:55.410 --> 00:20:00.320
the disciples very much, absolutely control.

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:05.210
You have to get up at four o’clock, sit down for meditation.

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:08.760
If you have not got up, they would beat.

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:14.240
I can’t understand. Sahaja

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:20.180
Yoga is very different

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:31.260
from all other gurus that we believe in the power of love.

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:41.860
Power of love teaches you how to be forgiving.

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:46.800
It makes you noble.

00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:54.960
It makes you very balanced.

00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:02.200
So the gurus who were there for bhavasagara

00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:10.100
to establish dharma in the human beings,

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:17.440
first thing, they had to balance themselves

00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:26.840
against all practical things, as they call it.

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:30.820
They think it is not practical,

00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:42.550
but they said, “No, for us, this is higher, nobler and important.”

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:47.160
So they would balance people

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:52.380
because they had this power of love within themselves.

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:57.820
All these Adi Gurus and their incarnations, if you see them,

00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:06.760
they always had balance and always praised the love of God.

00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:23.190
When we talk about Realization, one has to know, first of all,

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:27.080
that we have to have patience with ourselves.

00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:33.680
I know some people don’t feel so good,

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:37.810
some people still have sicknesses.

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:42.390
Some people don’t even feel vibrations sometimes.

00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:47.280
Have patience with yourself.

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:50.110
When you become your own guru, first thing,

00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:56.360
as the guru has patience with his or her disciple,

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.710
you must have patience with yourself.

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:13.050
In that patience, you will learn that you can tolerate

00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:17.720
so many things without any trouble.

00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:22.840
They say one person who goes on grudging,

00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:26.150
“Oh, this is not good. That is not good”

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:35.500
because they have no patience with themselves.

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:42.970
If you have patience with yourself, everything you’ll accept.

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:48.050
Wherever you are, you are with yourself

00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:50.520
because you’re realized souls.

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:56.440
So you won’t frustrate, you’ll not get angry

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:05.650
and also you’ll not go on grumbling and grudging

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:09.150
because you’re enjoying yourself.

00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:14.600
Even if there’s a mattress, all right.

00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:16.940
If there isn’t, you can sleep on the grass.

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:19.650
If there’s no grass, you can sleep on the stone.

00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:23.400
And also you need not sleep like last night,

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:28.500
makes no difference whatsoever.

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:33.160
The first thing I find with people,

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:36.610
they have no patience with themselves.

00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:42.730
Firstly, maybe, because they’re conditioned.

00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:45.560
Say, if you have a left Vishuddhi,

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:50.110
by any chance you have been a Catholic or T.M. or something,

00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:54.440
then all the time you start pitying yourself,

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:57.480
thinking no end of your miseries and troubles

00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:00.930
and always try to condemn yourself.

00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:03.210
You are a realized soul

00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:08.200
and you have no business to condemn yourself, no business.

00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:17.580
Like a person who’s getting drowned, has been saved,

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:21.500
has come to the shore, now is doing nicely,

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:25.970
has got his second life

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:32.120
and there he’s still trying to express his agony,

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:34.960
as if he’s getting drowned.

00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:41.230
So you have to awaken yourself. “No, no, no more I am there.

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:46.790
I’m finished. It’s gone now. I am different.

00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:52.200
That was somebody else. I am not the same person.”

00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:57.900
This is how you have to tell yourself very clearly

00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:01.380
that “I am not going to condemn myself.”

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:10.780
It was your right to get Self Realization. You got it.

00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:18.190
And then you cannot enjoy it because you have these conditionings,

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:23.230
especially in the West to be miserable, it is very fashionable.

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:30.570
There are miseries of people who have no miseries.

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:51.980
So, for such people who have imaginary miseries of the past,

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:54.570
which do not exist in reality,

00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:59.020
they cannot have the joy of reality. They cannot.

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:09.520
So, for a Sahaja Yogi, it’s important that he should have joy

00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:21.880
within his heart. It’s like an ocean.

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:31.580
It’s like an ocean which is there all the time

00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:41.130
to give you such thrills.

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:50.490
Even little drops of this ocean,

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:58.330
when they trickle down in your being, it is so soothing.

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:03.650
The experience can be only experienced.

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:10.970
It’s all waiting within yourself.

00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:23.820
And such a person also makes others joyous.

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:30.770
He cannot see another person unhappy, in trouble.

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:40.230
Himself is full of joy and spreads joy all around.

00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:44.800
You can get joy from small, small things

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:48.140
because you have the ocean

00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:51.400
and a little thing that drops into the ocean

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:56.110
creates such beautiful ripples. They touch the shores,

00:28:58.210 --> 00:29:02.130
not only of your own being, but of others.

00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:10.100
Very, very small things make you so very happy

00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:13.880
and that all the time

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:17.770
you are just like a surfing, as they call it these days,

00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:23.070
on this beautiful lake or a beautiful ocean of love.

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:30.390
Love is joy-giving. It’s not carnal love.

00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:34.940
It is Divine Love.

00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:42.070
So, as Sahaja Yogis and as gurus, we have to love ourselves

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:45.090
and understand our own value.

00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:50.750
I think Sahaja Yogis have not yet understood their value.

00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:55.100
How many people in this world can give Realization?

00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:02.400
How many know about kundalini?

00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:10.990
How many have seen people being resurrected all the time?

00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:20.580
You are made so powerful

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:28.690
that even looking at people, you can give Realization.

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:41.410
In ordinary love, in carnal love people have fear.

00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:49.320
They’re afraid that their beloved might depart

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:53.000
or might get sick, might happen this

00:30:55.970 --> 00:31:04.250
and they might all the time be under fear, resist enjoying.

00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:15.320
But, for you, you are with yourself and you are always protected.

00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:28.960
If your attention is bad for a second even,

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:32.510
immediately you know you are going wrong.

00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:35.750
You protect yourself from yourself.

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:45.080
As soon as you get some physical problem, you can feel it.

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:47.930
You know how to cure yourself.

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:53.020
But again, one has to have balance.

00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:57.000
If you’re off the balance,

00:31:57.630 --> 00:32:00.670
then you don’t even feel vibrations,

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.970
you don’t even feel what’s wrong with you.

00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:08.520
You don’t know which direction you are moving,

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:11.530
whether you are getting destroyed.

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:18.370
And this balance has to be established by all the Sahaja Yogis.

00:32:29.150 --> 00:32:36.460
These imbalances come to us because we still think about our past

00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:38.920
or maybe about our future.

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:42.990
We worry about these things.

00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:49.940
What is there to worry when all the angels and all the ganas

00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:52.030
are working for you?

00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:56.870
You just have to order, that’s all.

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:03.720
But it’s like sometimes a person is made a king

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:10.510
and is put on a throne, but before that he was a beggar,

00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:14.090
so anybody who comes to bow before him, he says,

00:33:14.290 --> 00:33:18.350
“All right. Give me one pound.”

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:25.500
You have to know that you are all realized souls

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:29.620
and that you have all the powers within you.

00:33:31.050 --> 00:33:35.230
Only thing which is very important is the balance.

00:33:36.510 --> 00:33:41.790
In Sahaja Yoga also people get into imbalances.

00:33:45.810 --> 00:33:54.720
How? Like I have seen people

00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:01.840
who are, say, afraid of these worldly laws.

00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:15.320
They don’t know there is such a powerful energy all around you.

00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:25.910
Nothing can stop you. Nothing can arrest you.

00:34:26.110 --> 00:34:28.490
Nothing can find faults.

00:34:28.690 --> 00:34:33.280
But when you start doubting, like yesterday’s doubting,

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:36.440
when you say, “But, but.”

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:43.720
When you start thinking about the man-made laws,

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:46.500
then the God’s laws fail.

00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:54.440
Otherwise, nobody can punish you, nobody can arrest you,

00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:59.910
nobody can do anything to you. You are absolutely protected.

00:35:05.010 --> 00:35:12.940
So the main difference between the old style of guru

00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:16.980
and the modern style of guru is this

00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:22.730
that the old gurus used to you must suffer. All right,

00:35:22.930 --> 00:35:24.950
you have to be arrested is very good.

00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:28.140
If they give you poison, take the poison.

00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:31.240
If they want to slap you, take slaps.

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:33.870
Whatever they want to do, you should accept

00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:36.350
because is your suffering.

00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:40.530
Not in Sahaja Yoga because your Mother is sitting here.

00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:43.660
How dare anybody touch you.

00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:53.700
No one can harm you. You have to believe Me when I say that.

00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:59.620
No one can harm you, but you must have that faith within yourself.

00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:05.800
Nobody had Adi Shakti as the Guru.

00:36:08.570 --> 00:36:12.540
Adi Shakti, the one who has all the powers of the world.

00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:18.460
So who can harm you? Who can torture you?

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:21.010
Who can trouble you except for yourself?

00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:25.130
If you want to torture yourself, nobody can harm you.

00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:32.860
So the greatest difference between this disciple of other gurus

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:37.080
and yourself is you don’t have to suffer.

00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:46.920
You are not to suffer and even, you see,

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:50.240
if there’s somebody who has some negativity, that person,

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:53.810
some Sahaja Yogis still carry on poor things they cannot help it

00:36:54.010 --> 00:36:57.000
they have been to wrong gurus or something.

00:36:57.310 --> 00:37:01.750
So they’ll meet with an accident,

00:37:02.330 --> 00:37:06.870
maybe they might face something terrible,

00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:11.150
but suddenly they’ll find they will get out of it.

00:37:11.350 --> 00:37:13.440
Maybe the negativity of somebody else,

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:18.590
some relations, some brothers, sisters or maybe of the nation.

00:37:22.570 --> 00:37:25.100
But you’ll get out of it.

00:37:29.090 --> 00:37:33.260
It is a very remarkable thing in Sahaja Yoga

00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:37.480
that there are people who catching.

00:37:38.250 --> 00:37:42.540
“Mother, my heart is catching. My this is catching. That is catching.”

00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:47.440
But once they want to give Realization, just moves, kundalini moves.

00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:53.220
Whatever you may be, whatever may be your problems,

00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:56.770
but you raise your hand and kundalini moves.

00:37:57.640 --> 00:37:59.590
I mean, any instrument which is spoiled,

00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:02.400
say, supposing this fan is spoiled, it won’t work.

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:06.720
But not Sahaja Yogis.

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:13.880
They work out, of course,

00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:18.470
if they don’t practice Sahaja Yoga

00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:21.740
or if they don’t give Realizations to others,

00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:26.100
then, of course, it can be a junk then.

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:30.600
Supposing you don’t use your car, may be very good

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:33.940
and you don’t use it, it becomes a junk.

00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:40.170
So you have to give. You have to give Realization.

00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:43.450
All of you, whether it’s women or men.

00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:49.260
Whatever country you may belong, you have to give Realization,

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:56.820
you have to allow this energy to go and work,

00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:03.810
otherwise it will suffocate.

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:09.450
I’ve seen many Sahaja Yogis who have not done anything like that.

00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:13.270
They are very nice to you. Mother, we worship you at home.

00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:16.820
They suffer also from arthritis

00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:23.620
or other kinds of things,

00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:28.720
spondylitis’ sometimes they will have or

00:39:29.370 --> 00:39:33.300
they may have cellulitis or all kinds of things they can have.

00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:41.790
So you have to use your energy for giving Realizations to others.

00:39:45.110 --> 00:39:49.110
It’s all right, in protocol, if you don’t understand,

00:39:49.310 --> 00:39:51.010
you are forgiven.

00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:56.930
Anything you might do out of innocence or ignorance is forgiven.

00:39:58.550 --> 00:40:02.430
But knowingly, if you want to do something,

00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:08.240
then I don’t know repercussions

00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:15.620
because the area where you are is safe,

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:20.340
but if you want to get out of that area,

00:40:22.690 --> 00:40:28.670
then all sides there are horrible negative forces working

00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:31.750
and you are captured into that.

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:37.810
That’s not a mistake of Sahaja Yoga.

00:40:40.650 --> 00:40:46.360
To find faults with Sahaja Yogis or with Sahaja Yoga

00:40:46.810 --> 00:40:50.290
is another mistake we commit sometime.

00:40:51.890 --> 00:40:58.970
Say there are ten disciples with a guru, very good excellent guru,

00:40:59.770 --> 00:41:04.850
if they complain about any one of them,

00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:12.920
immediately the guru will say, “You get out.”

00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:24.240
They have no business to complain about each other.

00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:29.430
On the contrary, like this hand is paining,

00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:32.250
then this hand doesn’t complain to the brain,

00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:34.580
but tries to soothe it.

00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:48.850
So Sahaja Yogis are gurus who belong to the collective.

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:54.910
They move in a group, as described by Gnyaneshwara,

00:41:55.640 --> 00:42:01.100
that you move now like the enlightened forest,

00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:09.840
which gives whatever people like, want to have, kalpatarus.

00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:21.650
And he said you move like oceans and talk about God.

00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:25.140
It’s not one single man standing and saying something.

00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:29.850
We saw yesterday in drama how a single man had to suffer.

00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:34.530
But you are in a group

00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:41.830
and all of you move in a group, together,

00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:46.440
with one understanding.

00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:50.590
Such a powerful group it is.

00:42:53.890 --> 00:42:59.590
They bring ambrosia to the people, according to Gnyaneshwara.

00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:08.180
But this power of collectivity that one feels

00:43:08.850 --> 00:43:11.890
is the first judgement of a person.

00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:21.800
Those who cannot be collective are not yet Sahaja Yogis.

00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:30.190
Some people think that they have served Me,

00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:35.210
they have looked after Me, they do My Puja or something,

00:43:35.890 --> 00:43:41.420
so that they have a right to scold others, to get angry with others,

00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:45.630
shout at them, tell them work, do all kinds of thing.

00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:49.720
It’s not so.

00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:55.230
You are a Sahaja Yogi when you are absolutely collective.

00:43:55.430 --> 00:44:00.380
Otherwise you are not a Sahaja Yogi when you are not collective.

00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:07.330
It’s so simple.

00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:13.310
That ego, the conditionings of ego

00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:21.860
or conditionings of the past may keep you away from others

00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:26.120
and there is no connection to the Divine any more left.

00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:28.350
Those who are not collective people

00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:31.470
have no relationship with the Divine.

00:44:36.650 --> 00:44:41.430
You have understood now what is collectivity is.

00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:47.520
Most surprising thing is for Me that by giving Realizations to you,

00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:54.830
I find it very easy to talk about subtlest of subtle things to you.

00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:01.490
All these things I don’t think any guru could have talked.

00:45:02.290 --> 00:45:06.630
Not possible. It would not go into their heads.

00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:12.120
Very subtle, it is. You have become subtle

00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:18.810
and the subtleties have their own beauty in expression,

00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:23.510
in expression, in talking,

00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:28.340
in behaving with others, in understanding.

00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:31.820
It’s so sweet and so beautiful.

00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:44.360
The collective feeling is something like

00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:52.650
a little particle of clay thinks it is a mountain,

00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:58.110
like a drop becoming the ocean.

00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:03.480
But if there’s one drop who says, “No, no, no. I can’t be collective.

00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:06.040
I stay on the shore.” All right,

00:46:06.250 --> 00:46:08.770
the sunshine will evaporate.

00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:16.580
“But, Mother, I worship you. I do this. I do that.”

00:46:17.550 --> 00:46:20.020
With all that, if you do not develop collectivity,

00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:22.120
better not worship Me.

00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:31.660
For that, how a guru should act with the collective?

00:46:35.250 --> 00:46:38.880
In Sahaja Yoga nobody should feel

00:46:39.710 --> 00:46:44.280
that you are some hierarchy or a higher personality.

00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:48.390
If you start feeling like that, then at that point,

00:46:48.590 --> 00:46:52.050
you must know that there is some possession on you.

00:46:58.790 --> 00:47:00.730
What is the highest in the water? Nothing.

00:47:00.930 --> 00:47:04.260
Everything is just the same. It’s the way it is there.

00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:09.630
It has to be used for its own purposes.

00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:20.090
And the cruelties sometimes people indulge into is unimaginable.

00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:32.170
How can this kind of satisfaction

00:47:32.370 --> 00:47:37.950
be there if you are Sahaja Yogis?

00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:42.450
I don’t know. They say so, that gurus used to beat

00:47:42.650 --> 00:47:48.080
and they used to do all kinds of things. There must be bhoots. No.

00:47:49.810 --> 00:47:54.970
A very angry gurus. You cannot afford to be angry.

00:47:55.170 --> 00:47:59.860
Cannot afford. Anger means imbalance.

00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:04.930
You get attached to, say, your family,

00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:09.360
start talking like that and no more.

00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:18.700
Attachment to anything shows you have no balance.

00:48:22.070 --> 00:48:26.840
Those who are balanced have to be detached.

00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:33.500
Otherwise you get attached to somebody.

00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:38.550
This is my daughter. This is my son. This is this.

00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:41.810
Then you don’t see the truth.

00:48:44.170 --> 00:48:46.810
So any kind of attachment,

00:48:50.660 --> 00:48:55.520
if you feel then know that you are not in balance.

00:48:58.210 --> 00:49:03.810
Also I’ve seen people get into a kind of a pride,

00:49:10.070 --> 00:49:12.940
pride that we are Sahaja Yogis.

00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:20.050
We have become Sahaja Yogis to save the whole world.

00:49:20.250 --> 00:49:23.350
It’s like I see so many government servants who think

00:49:23.550 --> 00:49:27.850
no end of themselves. They’re servants of the people.

00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:35.170
They may be called officers, but officers to serve.

00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:40.310
In the same way, we are in this world to serve God

00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:44.730
and the purpose of your service is to save the world,

00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:47.720
save the people.

00:49:48.610 --> 00:49:56.470
But if you have pride, false pride, how can you do that?

00:49:57.890 --> 00:50:03.070
The way you’ll talk, the way you’ll behave, nobody will come near.

00:50:09.850 --> 00:50:14.710
You cannot be jealous of another person, cannot be

00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:30.230
because jealousy means

00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:35.760
that you are trying to harm yourself really.

00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:40.010
I don’t know what jealousy is so much.

00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:43.070
I see people getting jealous,

00:50:43.270 --> 00:50:47.560
but I don’t know what it is really, jealousy.

00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:50.430
The funny stuff, isn’t it?

00:50:54.250 --> 00:50:59.920
It must be coming from animal kingdom maybe, I don’t know,

00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:06.520
because what is there to be jealous. I mean, you are realized souls.

00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:17.350
How can you be jealous of anyone?

00:51:17.550 --> 00:51:25.280
Say, supposing you are a diamond and another one is a diamond.

00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:30.630
Very good. Both put together will become even more brilliant.

00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:38.660
Now, supposing somebody is no good and you are very good,

00:51:40.810 --> 00:51:45.220
then there is nothing to feel jealous of the man who is no good.

00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:52.140
Or also somebody who is good, to feel jealous, what is your gain?

00:51:53.010 --> 00:51:56.160
If you think that gentleman is good or that lady’s good,

00:51:56.360 --> 00:52:01.390
better try to follow what she is doing, how is she good,

00:52:01.590 --> 00:52:04.560
how she has got this goodness.

00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:10.780
It’s better to study.

00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:17.420
I really enjoy the most when Sahaja Yogis start

00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:22.460
expressing their feelings about other Sahaja Yogis.

00:52:25.570 --> 00:52:29.330
“Mother, he’s like that. Mother, he’s like that.”

00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:34.630
So, they see the goodness of others.

00:52:34.830 --> 00:52:39.010
They see the greatness of others, the nobility of others

00:52:39.210 --> 00:52:42.890
and when you start seeing that, you start becoming.

00:52:48.190 --> 00:52:53.010
If you feel jealous, I mean,

00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:56.530
I don’t know what sort of a thing it is, as I told you.

00:52:56.730 --> 00:53:00.300
But you are condemning yourself permanently.

00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:04.110
Today you are jealous of somebody because he has black hair.

00:53:04.310 --> 00:53:07.330
You are jealous of somebody because he has grey hair.

00:53:07.530 --> 00:53:10.980
You’re jealous of somebody because he has got a long nose,

00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:15.000
jealous of somebody because he has got a short nose.

00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:19.270
[Shri Mataji speaks to a Sahaja Yogi:] What is happening?

00:53:19.470 --> 00:53:22.610
What happened? Ha?

00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:30.550
Are you a Sahaja Yogi?

00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:34.830
You are a Sahaja Yogi. Then you know the protocol. Let Me speak.

00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:37.360
All right? You can ask Me later on.

00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:41.430
This is not the way. This is not a parliament here.

00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:45.630
I know. I know that I don’t force any discipline,

00:53:45.830 --> 00:53:48.250
but this should be self discipline.

00:53:48.450 --> 00:53:51.370
You should be self-disciplined.

00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:55.310
I’m speaking just now. Listen to Me.

00:53:55.510 --> 00:53:59.720
Maybe I might answer you in My speech.

00:54:08.170 --> 00:54:17.380
So the relationship among yourselves

00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:24.040
cannot have anything to do with jealousy. Cannot.

00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:28.870
Because it kills your joy.

00:54:37.570 --> 00:54:44.640
Now, as I told you, that you get rid of your fear.

00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:47.880
You get rid of your jealousies.

00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:56.630
You get rid of your pride,

00:54:56.830 --> 00:54:59.230
false one.

00:54:59.430 --> 00:55:04.990
And also you get rid of your impatience.

00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:10.920
You must have patience.

00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:19.350
This is another style of guru

00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:24.430
who has patience, tremendous patience.

00:55:26.730 --> 00:55:30.980
Nothing to get angry, nothing to get upset.

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.120
And gradually, you will see,

00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:38.090
without telling people, they will discipline themselves.

00:55:39.630 --> 00:55:43.330
It is you have to discipline yourself.

00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:50.840
In the system of Sahaja Yoga,

00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:55.810
we never had so many disciples.

00:55:56.730 --> 00:56:02.690
Imagine till Shri Gnyaneshwara, there was only one disciple

00:56:02.890 --> 00:56:05.210
and some of them never had any disciple,

00:56:05.410 --> 00:56:08.810
like William Blake, I don’t think had any disciple.

00:56:10.250 --> 00:56:12.020
Perhaps, they must have thought

00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:14.830
that nobody can come up to this level or understand.

00:56:15.030 --> 00:56:19.090
So many of them had no disciple.

00:56:19.290 --> 00:56:21.910
Sai Nath had no disciple.

00:56:22.110 --> 00:56:25.180
They came on this Earth or maybe they might be thinking

00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:29.270
useless people, what’s the use of having disciples?

00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:39.120
But, for you, it’s so great that we are so many of us together now,

00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:43.910
so many. We understand each other. We know each other.

00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:52.450
We know all about kundalini

00:56:52.650 --> 00:56:56.170
and  we are so aware about everything.

00:56:56.890 --> 00:56:59.030
We know what’s happening in this world.

00:56:59.230 --> 00:57:02.640
We are not just sitting in a cave in Himalayas

00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:06.500
and just we are doing, taking the name of God. No.

00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:12.720
We are in the world. We are not running away from the world.

00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:15.410
We are in this world.

00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:25.060
We are facing every day,

00:57:26.330 --> 00:57:29.620
every problem that is there.

00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:35.670
But we are in reality and they are in ignorance.

00:57:36.730 --> 00:57:42.540
That’s why we know, we know the solution,

00:57:44.450 --> 00:57:49.140
we know the problem and we can solve it.

00:57:50.730 --> 00:57:54.400
Now, you have to just experiment with your powers,

00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:59.450
of course with humility that I have to warn some people.

00:57:59.650 --> 00:58:03.980
See, they just sit on the horse, immediately I say that.

00:58:04.650 --> 00:58:08.660
First of all, you must know that you are a store of knowledge,

00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:11.020
complete store of knowledge

00:58:13.730 --> 00:58:20.160
about everything, except for bank, I would say.

00:58:21.570 --> 00:58:24.760
That’s the problem for Me.

00:58:31.210 --> 00:58:39.190
So you should have projection

00:58:41.810 --> 00:58:45.490
towards that source of knowledge.

00:58:47.620 --> 00:58:53.330
For example, everything can be interpreted in the Sahaj language.

00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:58.960
Everything. You see this pandal.

00:58:59.270 --> 00:59:02.350
It’s standing there because supported by this

00:59:02.550 --> 00:59:08.470
– just like Sahaja Yoga. We are supported by our dharma.

00:59:08.670 --> 00:59:10.160
Very simple thing like that.

00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:12.890
Everywhere you’ll find

00:59:13.090 --> 00:59:18.580
the comparison of Sahaja Yoga with everything else that you see.

00:59:21.880 --> 00:59:28.040
This is very important. That will give a double joy.

00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:38.200
The other day I was coming back

00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:48.000
and in the airport, it was I was perspiring,

00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:51.330
perspiring absolutely.

00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:54.310
And the Sahaja Yogi who was with Me, he said, “Mother,

00:59:54.510 --> 00:59:58.990
You are sucking all the heat of this place, the negativity.”

00:59:59.190 --> 01:00:02.200
It was a fact. But only a Sahaja Yogi can see.

01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:06.180
Everybody was sitting nicely. I was the one fanning Myself.

01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:09.090
Everybody was so comfortable, feeling the cool from Me

01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:11.830
and I was fanning Myself.

01:00:15.090 --> 01:00:18.530
One day it happened, I was going to a shop,

01:00:18.730 --> 01:00:20.750
all the Australian Sahaja Yogi following Me,

01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:25.080
in a Chinese shop. I don’t know what these Chinese do.

01:00:25.410 --> 01:00:28.990
Climbing up was feeling so hot and exhausted.

01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:34.220
I was just trying to soothe Myself.

01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:37.210
And they’re saying, “Mother, such cool coming from you.”

01:00:37.410 --> 01:00:39.520
I said, “Very nice.”

01:00:44.270 --> 01:00:49.330
I’m the one consuming all the heat and giving you all the cool.

01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:57.770
But that is what My job is,

01:00:58.020 --> 01:01:01.440
to take all the heat from everyone

01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:07.680
and transform it into something cooling and soothing.

01:01:09.010 --> 01:01:13.880
When people shout, scream, this, that.

01:01:14.090 --> 01:01:18.540
Peaceful, be peaceful and listen to them

01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:25.330
and then you can pour water on them completely

01:01:25.530 --> 01:01:28.100
and the whole heat can go away.

01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:31.740
So this absorption is very important.

01:01:31.940 --> 01:01:34.550
Not to be afraid of absorption.

01:01:34.750 --> 01:01:39.510
But, for that, I would say one should take care

01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:42.760
and the care, as you know, is a very simple thing, this Kavacha,

01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:49.000
is this bandhan that you have to take.

01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:56.080
For all this, whatever I have said, there’s one guru mantra,

01:01:57.050 --> 01:02:01.700
to remember that we are Sahaja Yogis.

01:02:02.830 --> 01:02:08.660
Just remember this. We are Sahaja Yogis.

01:02:11.250 --> 01:02:19.260
And once you know you are Sahaja Yogis, this projection will start.

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:24.010
What happened to William Blake? If you see,

01:02:24.210 --> 01:02:27.180
he started projecting his imagination

01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:31.780
and he reached the point of knowledge.

01:02:34.580 --> 01:02:39.420
So anything that you see, anything you do or others are doing,

01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:44.110
try to relate it with Sahaja Yoga and project.

01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:49.760
Then you will also reach the Ocean of Love.

01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:53.410
Once you have that, then what?

01:02:53.610 --> 01:02:56.220
Who can disturb you? Who can trouble you?

01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:59.060
Who can make anything that is difficult for you?

01:02:59.260 --> 01:03:02.240
Because you are sitting in the ocean, the fellow

01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:03.940
is sitting outside somewhere,

01:03:04.140 --> 01:03:07.210
how can it come into the ocean to trouble you?

01:03:09.310 --> 01:03:14.290
So this is what is to remember that you are a Sahaja Yogi.

01:03:14.850 --> 01:03:20.790
Take a bandhan morning and evening. It’s so simple.

01:03:20.990 --> 01:03:25.980
Even to say on the “my,” it seems stupid to Me.

01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:29.520
But, I have to say because people forget.

01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:32.170
You forget that you are realized souls.

01:03:32.370 --> 01:03:38.200
Use your vibratory awareness for at least protecting yourself

01:03:42.170 --> 01:03:45.440
because there is negativity sitting next to you.

01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:49.070
So be very careful about this, to remember that

01:03:49.270 --> 01:03:50.870
“I am a Sahaja Yogi.”

01:03:51.070 --> 01:03:53.880
Once you say that, you will know how you have to behave,

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:55.510
what is the protocol,

01:03:55.710 --> 01:03:58.530
you will know what is the discipline you have to follow,

01:03:58.730 --> 01:04:02.670
you’ll know how to love others, everything.

01:04:05.390 --> 01:04:07.550
This is the essence.

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:13.710
How many have been Sahaja Yogis before?

01:04:13.990 --> 01:04:16.400
Poor things, all these gurus suffered so much.

01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:18.610
You are not to suffer,

01:04:18.810 --> 01:04:24.990
not to go into any kind of a misery anymore, no more.

01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:29.130
But don’t forget you are Sahaja Yogis, that’s why.

01:04:29.540 --> 01:04:32.680
That will give you complete confidence in yourself and

01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:36.160
you’ll be absolutely secured.

01:04:37.530 --> 01:04:42.500
Try to establish the state that you are Sahaja Yogis.

01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:48.890
Thus, you become gurus of yourself and of others.

01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:51.590
May God bless you.
