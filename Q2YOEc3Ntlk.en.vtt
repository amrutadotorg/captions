WEBVTT

00:00:20.315 --> 00:00:28.281
I have told you, the other day that these
vibrations are power of Brahma and

00:00:28.306 --> 00:00:36.289
that this Earth, the
Stars they revolve

00:00:36.314 --> 00:00:44.045
and it is a living force.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.340
It is the power which
is giving us the living force.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.508
It is the living
force and it is not easy

00:00:56.532 --> 00:01:01.922
to understand what
is a living force and what is a dead force?

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.615
Living force is very
simple to understand.

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:13.332
An animal, say a little worm, is a living
force. It can turn itself the way it likes.

00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:18.398
It can save itself from
danger. It may be a small little thing, but

00:01:18.423 --> 00:01:21.115
because it is
living it can save itself.

00:01:21.116 --> 00:01:25.098
But something that
is dead cannot move by itself.

00:01:25.165 --> 00:01:28.848
can not comprehend,
cannot save itself.

00:01:28.882 --> 00:01:35.574
So, the “Self” part does not
remain in it, as far as it is concerned.

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:39.398
Now, being a
living force, we should try to find out,

00:01:39.464 --> 00:01:42.180
“Are we going
to be the living force

00:01:42.204 --> 00:01:49.814
or the dead one”.

00:01:49.865 --> 00:01:54.198
Now, when we live in the world,

00:01:54.222 --> 00:01:58.898
we start thinking
about our comforts;

00:01:58.967 --> 00:02:06.589
when we are pleased,
when are soothed

00:02:06.614 --> 00:02:08.914
When we think
of all these things,

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:14.911
you see, we are
thinking of the dead.

00:02:14.996 --> 00:02:22.696
But when we think
of having a place or a house or an Ashram

00:02:25.544 --> 00:02:31.911
from the angle
that you Will be doing some living work,

00:02:31.935 --> 00:02:37.644
then you are
giving life to that place.

00:02:37.711 --> 00:02:44.935
That atmosphere should be created
from all that is dead-

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.902
to create the living force.

00:02:49.926 --> 00:02:55.192
This is a very very subtle thing, which
very few people understand, for example, now

00:02:55.216 --> 00:03:01.092
somebody brings me
a Shri Ganesh's photo

00:03:01.126 --> 00:03:05.459
and says, “Should I worship
this Shri Ganesh’s photograph or not”.

00:03:05.483 --> 00:03:13.476
First of all, we should see
if vibrations are coming from it or not.

00:03:13.501 --> 00:03:18.983
Supposing you take
a house somewhere, you must see that

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.266
this house is
it giving us vibrations.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.123
This is the cause,
we see other things, why we even see

00:03:28.147 --> 00:03:30.989
whether it is good for other people to
come in or not,

00:03:31.047 --> 00:03:36.023
but we do not see
the house from vibrations point of view.

00:03:36.047 --> 00:03:41.563
For anything
that we do, we should check the vibrations.

00:03:41.587 --> 00:03:48.445
[INAUDIBLE- Meanwhile now, to think in terms of vibratory awareness
which means awareness that is working upon living things.]

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:56.453
And say, a cell at the tip
of the root is a living thing. Of course,

00:03:56.478 --> 00:04:03.336
it does not think, it is directed
by the living force itself. So, it knows

00:04:03.361 --> 00:04:06.961
how to move with the living force
because to live with it and to understand

00:04:06.986 --> 00:04:12.020
the plan of the living force to
get along with it and how to merge with it.

00:04:12.048 --> 00:04:16.798
But, we human beings have got the
freedom to decide.

00:04:16.832 --> 00:04:21.623
Now, once you are
realized you have got that living force.

00:04:21.648 --> 00:04:24.842
This is the living force
as you get. So, you

00:04:24.866 --> 00:04:28.060
have to know how
to use this living force to

00:04:28.098 --> 00:04:35.881
keep your this body,
mind, ego, superego and everything

00:04:35.906 --> 00:04:43.897
in an enlightened state, by understanding
the planning of the living force.

00:04:43.948 --> 00:04:51.948
It gives you all the ideas as to
most of the problems. For example, here in

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:59.979
this country and specially in Delhi, I
find that you catch on the left Nabhi,

00:05:00.012 --> 00:05:07.451
catch on the right Swadishthana and
then you catch

00:05:07.476 --> 00:05:14.726
on the Heart and also on your Agnya.
These are the four Chakras which deal with

00:05:14.751 --> 00:05:22.124
our being. So, let us try from the left
side. What happens? On the left side

00:05:22.174 --> 00:05:27.407
the problem starts from left swadhishthna,
because that is the first Chakra

00:05:27.407 --> 00:05:35.407
that starts emitting the negativity within
us. Now, this left Swadishthana is actually

00:05:35.441 --> 00:05:43.441
under control only of Shri Ganesh because
Shri Ganesh is the beginning of life

00:05:43.474 --> 00:05:49.824
and Ganesh is the link between the
life and the death.

00:05:49.857 --> 00:05:57.590
So Ganesha is one who gives the
balance, the “Vivek” the understanding to

00:05:57.615 --> 00:06:05.615
you by which you know how far to go
with the things. Now, left Swadhishthana

00:06:05.632 --> 00:06:11.181
catches, you start
going to other people

00:06:11.215 --> 00:06:16.781
who try to promise you that such things,
like “I will give you this and that,

00:06:16.782 --> 00:06:23.288
this will happen, that will happen
to you”. But this left sided thing can come

00:06:23.313 --> 00:06:30.848
from our own desire for wrong things.
For example, we might be desiring for

00:06:30.872 --> 00:06:38.765
the very wrong; we might be thinking
that let us have this kind of a dead thing

00:06:38.798 --> 00:06:46.798
or that kind of dead thing or some sort
of a special thing that he wants to keep,

00:06:46.832 --> 00:06:49.098
he wants to keep,
he wants to keep

00:06:49.148 --> 00:06:51.305
INAUDIBLE

00:06:51.331 --> 00:06:55.048
He must go to the
fridge, because he wants a

00:06:55.148 --> 00:06:57.915
fridge, and he
must get it. Why he wants a fridge ?

00:06:57.948 --> 00:07:01.409
Because
he thinks it will give him more comfort.

00:07:01.443 --> 00:07:05.743
But, when he brings
the fridge, he knows that it is not so.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:10.759
So, the best
way to look at all dead things is not to

00:07:10.826 --> 00:07:15.843
go too far with them.

00:07:15.876 --> 00:07:20.676
If you have, well and
good. If you do not have, well and good.

00:07:20.709 --> 00:07:25.742
You can live with minimum of minimum or you
can live with maximum of maximum of these.

00:07:25.793 --> 00:07:30.559
But when we start expanding
our dead possessions, it is very much bad.

00:07:30.593 --> 00:07:33.876
Then our
attention goes into the dead. That’s how

00:07:33.893 --> 00:07:39.092
we move into our subconscious
then over to collective subconscious.

00:07:39.132 --> 00:07:46.781
Then it moves higher at the left Nabhi,
and at left Nabhi, we start becoming

00:07:46.831 --> 00:07:54.378
crazy about these dead
things. For example, the watch, the Time.

00:07:54.415 --> 00:07:57.367
Time is a dead
thing, it is not a living

00:07:57.391 --> 00:08:00.935
things. It has nothing
to do with living thing.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:06.768
For example, you cannot say exactly at
what time the flower will become a fruit.

00:08:06.793 --> 00:08:11.034
So this watch or time has nothing to
do with the living force at all. It is

00:08:11.067 --> 00:08:16.384
human mind or man-made like the watch;
particularly time is also man made. For

00:08:16.434 --> 00:08:22.717
example, today, time here is something,
but in England it is different. So if

00:08:22.742 --> 00:08:30.692
if you say you get up at 4 O'clock in India
is the same at Engliand, is not correct.

00:08:30.759 --> 00:08:35.525
So, the timing
is not important. What time you arrive

00:08:35.615 --> 00:08:43.342
what time you go, how
many times you do it, is not ‘important.

00:08:43.375 --> 00:08:48.158
Because it is a living
force; it has no time limit or space limit,

00:08:48.183 --> 00:08:52.141
you cannot count it, the
way it moves, the way it works out. Because

00:08:52.159 --> 00:08:59.592
it is a living force. Once we understand
this that it is a living force which is

00:08:59.676 --> 00:09:05.409
spontaneous, which
is not bothered about our dead ideas,

00:09:05.459 --> 00:09:10.342
now we have come out of the dead. We
were first stones, then we became amoebae,

00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:18.242
then we gradually became human beings.
So, our attention is all the time towards

00:09:18.309 --> 00:09:24.814
the dead. What should we
get, what should we have, what is the needs

00:09:24.848 --> 00:09:29.514
we have of this body
which is going to die.

00:09:29.538 --> 00:09:36.298
We do not see to the needs of the Spirit.
By seeing to the needs of the spirit,

00:09:36.323 --> 00:09:43.789
only you can overcome the left side.
Such start looking also goes to your

00:09:43.818 --> 00:09:51.307
spirit from which you can know that you get
your vibrations. If your Spirit is happy,

00:09:51.332 --> 00:09:56.068
you get your vibrations, if it
is unhappy, you do not get the vibrations.

00:09:56.096 --> 00:09:59.813
Such a common thing! If
you have any disease on left hand side or

00:09:59.838 --> 00:10:03.979
a problem on left hand
side, to give it a balance, you put your

00:10:04.004 --> 00:10:12.054
attention to the future. But then people
get stuck up on the future. You see,

00:10:12.136 --> 00:10:20.036
if I say you look to the future. As dead
is dead and is illusion, is not living,

00:10:20.087 --> 00:10:25.459
in the same way future is
also not living, which is also not there.

00:10:25.493 --> 00:10:29.626
So both the things are just
the same. Whether you go to left or right,

00:10:29.651 --> 00:10:32.543
whether you go to the subconscious
or the supraconscious mind, both

00:10:32.577 --> 00:10:39.994
the thing is just the
same. So, no use going to the past,

00:10:40.027 --> 00:10:42.348
but if you
are too much in the past, it is better

00:10:42.372 --> 00:10:44.692
to think of the future,
so that you are pushed

00:10:44.743 --> 00:10:52.436
little bit to the contrary state.
But, it is difficult for you, human beings.

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:55.993
Now, the other
problem starts within of,

00:10:56.010 --> 00:11:01.610
then we start feeling guilty,

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:04.718
then left Vishuddhi catches.

00:11:04.743 --> 00:11:09.441
Left Vishuddhi catches because we
start feeling guilty about whatever we are

00:11:09.525 --> 00:11:11.361
and that, which should
be said that, “I should

00:11:11.385 --> 00:11:13.508
have not done
this or I should not have done that”.

00:11:13.525 --> 00:11:18.991
Then you start saying, “I am very miserable,
miserable and I am myself very guilty”.

00:11:19.025 --> 00:11:24.858
So further you don't ask for anything
else. This is another nonsense.

00:11:24.858 --> 00:11:28.625
That is how once
you start doing that,

00:11:28.642 --> 00:11:31.691
then what happens is that you again
become dead.

00:11:33.758 --> 00:11:36.897
Because living force
will never condemn. No, it will Never.

00:11:36.996 --> 00:11:42.919
It goes on progressing itself. It sees,
which side to move, this side or that side.

00:11:42.936 --> 00:11:46.802
It is not going to condemn itself. It is
not going to aggress anything.

00:11:46.839 --> 00:11:52.139
It has that wisdom
to be in the Centre.

00:11:52.164 --> 00:11:59.161
That is how people should over-come
their left side, by putting their attention

00:11:59.185 --> 00:12:05.118
away from the dead
things, that are there.

00:12:05.152 --> 00:12:11.551
Must watch from the Centre.

00:12:11.585 --> 00:12:19.294
When you are on the left
side, what you want to see, you don’t see.

00:12:19.328 --> 00:12:23.961
But then ultimately to escape all this,
what you do is to start blaming yourself

00:12:23.994 --> 00:12:30.011
all the time and feeling miserable.
But this is the way you start ending up

00:12:30.028 --> 00:12:35.091
with your left side
into a very miserable state, that is the

00:12:35.188 --> 00:12:41.908
culmination of all these attachments
to the left side. So, ultimately

00:12:41.928 --> 00:12:44.100
you start thinking that you are good
for nothing, you are

00:12:44.125 --> 00:12:49.911
useless, you should
have done this, you should have done that.

00:12:49.936 --> 00:12:55.216
Now, at this time to overcome
it, you have to count your blessings.

00:12:55.241 --> 00:13:03.277
Count your Blessings
one by one. You have got your Realization.

00:13:03.302 --> 00:13:10.702
During thousands
of years how many have got realization?

00:13:10.702 --> 00:13:12.999
You have got your vibrations.

00:13:13.024 --> 00:13:20.323
In so many centuries, how many people have
got them? It is written in Jain system

00:13:20.357 --> 00:13:22.957
that there were altogether

00:13:22.974 --> 00:13:30.957
26 Kashyaps (Realized Souls).

00:13:30.982 --> 00:13:35.615
So, even after Buddha,

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:39.856
how many got their realization?

00:13:39.873 --> 00:13:45.546
You must thank God also that there are
so many realized people, they talk the same

00:13:45.571 --> 00:13:53.439
And you must thank yourself
also, that everything can be known to you.

00:13:53.472 --> 00:13:56.339
But, when you start catching on the
left, you go to the past and

00:13:56.436 --> 00:13:58.714
Start thinking, you think
and you start saying,

00:13:58.738 --> 00:14:03.789
“Oh God ? I am so useless, I am
good for nothing. I am useless, that I am

00:14:03.822 --> 00:14:10.755
still catching”. As you know, ‘the left
hand side, those who catch are always

00:14:10.822 --> 00:14:18.720
complaining, always grudging type
because poor things, they suffer. Now, to

00:14:18.813 --> 00:14:24.196
match with that the other
side, so, if I tell you that you go to the

00:14:24.221 --> 00:14:30.171
other side also, it is a very very
dangerous game. For example, we have so many

00:14:30.196 --> 00:14:36.246
conditionings in our lives. You see, first
of all reaching that our desire is to

00:14:36.275 --> 00:14:41.229
become excellent Sahaja Yogis,
to become Master Gurus and something great

00:14:41.247 --> 00:14:45.087
and this and that; that
there should be many disciples that

00:14:45.113 --> 00:14:49.743
they should touch our feet
and we should be called Great Gurus etc.

00:14:49.767 --> 00:14:53.977
So, in Sahaja Yoga there are things
that are prohibited that no Sahaja Yogi

00:14:53.994 --> 00:14:56.682
should touch anybody’s
feet and no Sahaja

00:14:56.706 --> 00:14:59.934
Yogi should allow
anyone to touch their feet.

00:15:00.034 --> 00:15:05.801
This is one of the great
Bandhanas for all Sahaja Yogis that no body

00:15:05.838 --> 00:15:09.638
should touch each other’s feet
and nor anybody should touch your feet,

00:15:09.734 --> 00:15:17.119
whatever may be your quality, whatever
you may be. Those who will touch will loose

00:15:17.202 --> 00:15:23.169
vibrations, and those who will get
salutations will also catch; they will catch

00:15:23.269 --> 00:15:28.325
on the heart.

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:32.950
So, such conditions, in fact we have
about Sahaja Yoga also, should be removed.

00:15:32.974 --> 00:15:37.969
We are all of us growing together. We
are part and parcel of one personality.

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:42.737
All are equal, nobody is higher or lower.
The one who still thinks the slightest

00:15:42.762 --> 00:15:47.070
like this will go down faster.

00:15:47.203 --> 00:15:52.620
This is the left side conditioning, where
people falter very much.

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:55.294
So, such desires must be given up in
Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:55.327 --> 00:15:59.487
You, must have very
wider desires in Sahaja Yoga that all of us

00:15:59.511 --> 00:16:03.460
must get realization-say as many as possible.
We should try to save as many people

00:16:03.527 --> 00:16:08.443
as possible. We should try
to improve ourselves as far as we can, and

00:16:08.527 --> 00:16:12.751
we are nothing yet;
But we can improve and

00:16:12.777 --> 00:16:20.760
both the points if you put it all the
time, then it will work out. Like when

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:26.175
feel you should say, no, how can that
be? Mostly with left-sided people are

00:16:26.201 --> 00:16:30.488
extremely, really rejected.

00:16:30.513 --> 00:16:33.421
Now, the thoughts can come from the
left side also.

00:16:33.463 --> 00:16:35.280
Now that you
come to the right side

00:16:35.313 --> 00:16:38.530
Like, if you have some Bhoots in your
head, they can give you the thought that,

00:16:38.563 --> 00:16:46.430
“Oh, you are useless or good for
nothing.” Now, raise your right side and

00:16:46.472 --> 00:16:50.055
put down the left. Now why do we do this
? Because right side is the giver side and

00:16:50.055 --> 00:16:56.922
due to that here you
get the Grace and put down the left side.

00:16:56.939 --> 00:17:02.722
Such people who suffer from the left
side should try this. One more thing, is,

00:17:02.755 --> 00:17:06.005
that first ideas come
to you or such thoughts that you are

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:09.638
good for nothing and all that,
it is better to beat yourself with shoes.

00:17:09.662 --> 00:17:13.355
Go and sing the
praise of the Lord and

00:17:13.355 --> 00:17:20.588
say that I am
so happy. I have got everything around me.

00:17:20.605 --> 00:17:24.055
So you got everything.

00:17:24.091 --> 00:17:32.672
Now, the second thing is about the right
side. On the right side, mostly you catch

00:17:32.739 --> 00:17:39.155
on the Swadishthan. That is
because you think. This is another kind of

00:17:39.156 --> 00:17:43.205
thinking which gives you catch
at right Swadishthan. At this we think,

00:17:43.289 --> 00:17:47.989
whether it comes from left or right will
give first problem for your liver.

00:17:48.006 --> 00:17:55.439
And the worst comes when both the
sides are involved. There are some Bhoots

00:17:55.505 --> 00:17:59.922
which give you ideas that," Oh!
you are good for nothing," this and that,

00:18:00.005 --> 00:18:03.355
and then you start
thinking that, "Oh! I am so great." And

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:08.905
such a wobbling starts coming
and the confusion starts building in.

00:18:08.955 --> 00:18:16.182
So, one must understand that in Sahaja
Yoga, you are to develop that sharp edge,

00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:22.082
that central point from which you do
not deviate to the right or the left and

00:18:22.082 --> 00:18:27.082
This is something so subtle that you are
left sided, you are not going to remain

00:18:27.149 --> 00:18:31.015
left sided. You might become
right-sided tomorrow. Exactly, tomorrow

00:18:31.016 --> 00:18:34.948
you can come with a right-sided
problem. So, you must learn that balancing,

00:18:34.982 --> 00:18:40.767
just like you start learning a bicycle,
you might fall on this side or that side.

00:18:40.792 --> 00:18:46.718
Now, when do you learn cycling ? If somebody
ask me, I will say, “When you learn.”

00:18:46.743 --> 00:18:50.142
I mean when you cycle
down, that’s the point when you learn.

00:18:50.229 --> 00:18:55.095
So, in Sahaja Yoga, to balance
it, you have to watch yourself carefully.

00:18:55.179 --> 00:19:01.295
Now, where does it go, to the
left side, alright then come to the right;

00:19:01.345 --> 00:19:05.478
Now come to
the centre. You just separate yourself,

00:19:05.512 --> 00:19:13.378
detach yourself all the
time, nor to criticize yourself neither to

00:19:13.412 --> 00:19:18.861
aggress anybody else or to criticize
others. But use this point just to

00:19:18.958 --> 00:19:25.745
see yourself, just to see and to
guide yourself. Guidance is very different

00:19:25.765 --> 00:19:29.581
from getting lost.
Now that is what it is.

00:19:29.602 --> 00:19:32.001
When a dead thing is lost,
supposing a dead thing is here.

00:19:32.004 --> 00:19:35.835
Supposing it's a dead thing, I throw it.
It will fall at the point where I throw it.

00:19:35.918 --> 00:19:41.777
But there's a living thing if I throw
it, it does not fall, where i throw it.

00:19:41.801 --> 00:19:48.517
the living force knows how to guide
itself, nothing follows. In the same way

00:19:48.535 --> 00:19:52.606
if you are living force
you will learn how to guide yourself.

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:59.454
If you have learnt
it, you have mastered Sahaja Yoga.

00:19:59.479 --> 00:20:06.263
No use condemning yourself, in any way
or thinking that you are great or small.

00:20:06.288 --> 00:20:11.348
But watch now, where the horse is going.
You are sitting on the top of the horse;

00:20:11.444 --> 00:20:16.231
now you are no more the horse.
Before, Realization you are the horse.

00:20:16.256 --> 00:20:21.626
Wherever the horse takes you, you go there.
If it sees the grass it eats the grass.

00:20:21.651 --> 00:20:28.792
Will you eat the grass. Then the horse
wants to kick somebody, you kick the horse.

00:20:28.794 --> 00:20:34.551
Now, you have come out of the
horse and sitting on the horse as a Rider.

00:20:34.567 --> 00:20:41.917
Now you are the Rider and you must
know how you are befooled by these things.

00:20:41.942 --> 00:20:47.457
And these are all old ancient
things revealed desired by you. And also

00:20:47.457 --> 00:20:51.873
the aggression, the Karma that you are
doing are also point ancient because

00:20:51.907 --> 00:20:59.907
by doing so you will get this, you will
get that. And when many people will say,

00:20:59.932 --> 00:21:04.890
“Mother, we are doing this, so much Sahaja
Yoga; we have still not achieved anything”.

00:21:11.698 --> 00:21:15.863
Now heart, if people are catching on
the heart, such people can never progress.

00:21:15.888 --> 00:21:21.688
When the heart is the source of Light,
heart is the source of Brahma Shakti.

00:21:21.722 --> 00:21:28.405
Heart is the seat of Atma. If your heart
is not enlightened when your heart is

00:21:28.438 --> 00:21:31.796
the living
force, then how can you progress ?

00:21:31.821 --> 00:21:37.471
So first clean your heart. Many people have
different types of powers, I would say.

00:21:37.471 --> 00:21:41.404
Some people are guided, if
somebody tells them, you can follow them.

00:21:41.433 --> 00:21:48.260
That's it. If there are some people who
tell them everything, so they're wrong.

00:21:48.294 --> 00:21:54.193
You don't listen. That's
how it is. You must know what to choose.

00:21:54.242 --> 00:21:59.391
This is what Sahaja Yoga should make of
you. You should grow, mature to that point

00:21:59.416 --> 00:22:06.232
you should know where what to do. This
is the goal. Then you don't ask for that.

00:22:06.257 --> 00:22:10.466
don't ask for that. You just do it
yourself as you try to solve the problem.

00:22:10.491 --> 00:22:15.132
You told your friend first time

00:22:15.156 --> 00:22:19.796
that what I do, I should
know what I'm doing.

00:22:19.821 --> 00:22:21.846
I should know what is correct.

00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:28.432
I should know how
to do it. I should know.

00:22:28.532 --> 00:22:29.583
I is not the state,
cannot be. No more ego

00:22:29.607 --> 00:22:30.839
exists or superego
exists, but it is the spirit

00:22:30.863 --> 00:22:33.065
which exists. And you find something, you
realize, children? They are so much there.

00:22:33.131 --> 00:22:34.636
No more ego exits or
super ego exits. It is the Spirit

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:36.136
that guides you and They
don't have such questions.

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:37.564
They know who is a
foolish person, who is stupid,

00:22:37.588 --> 00:22:38.992
who talks foolishly. They
know who is caught up.

00:22:39.016 --> 00:22:46.782
They are realized Souls. They are so much
there that they don't have these questions.

00:22:46.816 --> 00:22:53.465
They know who is a follish question,
who is stupid, who talks so silly,

00:22:53.466 --> 00:22:56.603
they know who is caught
up, they know whom to

00:22:56.627 --> 00:23:00.122
shut up, whom to argue.
They know you. There are

00:23:00.147 --> 00:23:06.488
They do not sympathize with people
who are caught up. No. They just watch.

00:23:06.545 --> 00:23:09.745
If somebody comes, they be
telling, what has he, this fellow is

00:23:09.769 --> 00:23:13.227
caught up. That's all. If somebody
comes, let him, he's all right.

00:23:13.252 --> 00:23:20.016
That's it. If somebody comes, you
see, enjoy, that's all. They just continue.

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:26.804
They do not hate anyone. They do not
get worried about anything. They just sit.

00:23:26.871 --> 00:23:30.903
If somebody comes with
a very bad aura, we say, let him go away.

00:23:30.928 --> 00:23:36.045
He better get all right. That's
all. Without any malice about the person.

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:41.953
Once you are on top of the hill, then
you don't have to worry about the traffic.

00:23:41.954 --> 00:23:45.787
But you are not at the top. That's
why you are worried and you think that

00:23:45.791 --> 00:23:50.717
I'm climbing and falling from here. But
this whole thing is just a mental shadow.

00:23:50.741 --> 00:23:58.224
It's a thought. You are on top of the hill.
But you are not assented. Ascension is not.

00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:03.923
You must be seated!
Be seated!

00:24:03.923 --> 00:24:05.363
You've been seated on the throne.

00:24:05.363 --> 00:24:07.543
Sitting on the throne, you're begging.

00:24:07.543 --> 00:24:09.283
Without the throne, everyone is crying.

00:24:09.283 --> 00:24:11.543
Sitting on the throne,
everyone is acting mad.

00:24:11.567 --> 00:24:14.349
What to do? Arrey Bhai, sit on the throne!

00:24:14.349 --> 00:24:19.565
You are a king, sit down. And
give orders to your five fingers.

00:24:19.658 --> 00:24:23.779
Sir! Now sit down, come on,
that’s enough. Now this is fine,

00:24:23.803 --> 00:24:27.924
now that is fine; you've
understood all that very well now.

00:24:27.942 --> 00:24:31.251
When you are able to command
yourself in this way, when

00:24:31.275 --> 00:24:34.583
you are able to control
yourself completely, only then—

00:24:34.607 --> 00:24:36.194
—are you a true Sahaja Yogi.

00:24:36.225 --> 00:24:40.196
Otherwise you will say, while sitting, just
like others say, “What can I do, Mataji,

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:44.191
I try so hard to control my mind, but it
goes inward again.” Then what is the mind?

00:24:44.224 --> 00:24:51.707
The mind is a living force, it will go.

00:24:51.741 --> 00:24:56.490
Let it go, it’s a living force, it will go
only to the place where it’s meant to go.

00:24:56.495 --> 00:25:02.802
It is all necessary to awaken our
qualities, and when they are awakened—

00:25:02.819 --> 00:25:05.739
—we will keep dropping
many things, keep letting

00:25:05.763 --> 00:25:09.119
go. Let them go; it won’t
happen without letting go.

00:25:09.119 --> 00:25:12.597
And in all these things, you need
to keep only one thing in mind:

00:25:12.623 --> 00:25:15.943
That our heart should
be pure, should be pure.

00:25:15.979 --> 00:25:20.036
Those who have a pure
heart face fewer problems.

00:25:20.036 --> 00:25:26.236
It means your impurities should be
cleansed. Purity means surrender.

00:25:26.236 --> 00:25:30.532
If there is a lack of surrender
in Sahaja Yoga, or if one

00:25:30.556 --> 00:25:34.852
thinks “I am special,” then
that person will have flaws.

00:25:34.902 --> 00:25:38.710
No education is needed for that, no
special people are needed for that.

00:25:38.735 --> 00:25:41.610
If it didn’t happen to me, if I
didn’t feel any experience—

00:25:41.634 --> 00:25:44.410
does it mean the fault is
with you or with Sahaja Yoga?

00:25:44.458 --> 00:25:49.127
People sometimes talk to me in such
a way, as if I had taken a contract for it.

00:25:49.148 --> 00:25:52.440
They say, “You did nothing for us.
I’ve gone mad. My mother! We’ve been

00:25:52.464 --> 00:25:56.180
coming to you for twenty-five years.”
Still the same twenty-five, twenty-five.

00:25:56.396 --> 00:26:04.183
But nothing is going to
happen to you, what can I do?

00:26:04.217 --> 00:26:08.350
So if it’s not happening, then it
means something is wrong within you.

00:26:08.423 --> 00:26:14.231
But as soon as you detach yourself,
you will begin to see your own faults.

00:26:14.256 --> 00:26:18.239
And as soon as you see them —
Rajesh, look here, he is like a king.

00:26:18.256 --> 00:26:22.128
He is seated on the throne, and
he notices that some of his subjects

00:26:22.152 --> 00:26:26.023
are misbehaving. “Stay quiet!”
— It’s not going to work like that.

00:26:26.056 --> 00:26:29.687
Not like that — do this, do that.

00:26:29.712 --> 00:26:32.132
A person should know
how to fully handle himself.

00:26:32.166 --> 00:26:33.715
Certainly.

00:26:33.749 --> 00:26:34.749
They are powerful.

00:26:34.774 --> 00:26:37.723
So you’ll have to speak with them.

00:26:37.766 --> 00:26:40.890
That will be the nature. Even a small
matter can be settled through conversation.

00:26:40.891 --> 00:26:42.874
We want to talk to you, we observe.

00:26:42.908 --> 00:26:45.618
They’re not even aware of
whom they are speaking with; and

00:26:45.642 --> 00:26:48.590
if they do, they do in such a
manner, it’s quite astonishing.

00:26:48.607 --> 00:26:54.224
There’s no more an understanding of
what we should say, and what we shouldn’t.

00:26:54.246 --> 00:26:58.005
We should have control over our
tongue; that control will only come

00:26:58.029 --> 00:27:02.245
when you observe detached from
self: “Is this tongue behaving properly?”

00:27:02.287 --> 00:27:09.976
This also — people just don’t do. If I
have to do it, then what should I do?

00:27:10.009 --> 00:27:16.443
It’s a new style, and then —
whom are you giving orders to?

00:27:16.483 --> 00:27:20.521
Come on now, go on
as usual. A person who is

00:27:20.545 --> 00:27:24.583
realized is always
cheerful, always joyful.

00:27:24.616 --> 00:27:29.183
Come on, you have to go.
Come on now, sit over there.

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:32.555
Even the children say
[unclear] “Now this Nirmala

00:27:32.579 --> 00:27:35.933
is not going to leave,
she’s siting here now.”

00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:37.816
They speak in the Third Person.

00:27:37.833 --> 00:27:40.014
Sahaja Yogis should
also speak in this way.

00:27:40.038 --> 00:27:42.433
Gradually, one should
detach oneself from self.

00:27:42.528 --> 00:27:45.649
The desires we have,
the ideas we have — the

00:27:45.673 --> 00:27:48.794
remaining desires or
any other ideas we carry,

00:27:48.795 --> 00:27:50.235
How long will you keep saying,

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:53.847
“I should do this, I should
do that.” Let go of all

00:27:53.871 --> 00:27:57.457
that, and think: What
should I do for Sahaja Yoga?

00:27:57.481 --> 00:27:58.960
What should we do for Sahaja Yoga?

00:27:59.044 --> 00:28:03.594
Even now in India, this thing is
very little, but abroad it is very much.

00:28:03.682 --> 00:28:07.004
Those people never come
and say to me that “My father's

00:28:07.028 --> 00:28:10.227
grandfather's cousin
brother is not getting cured.”

00:28:10.256 --> 00:28:11.256
Mother, please cure him.

00:28:11.289 --> 00:28:16.088
That’s too much. So never
about their material things—

00:28:16.114 --> 00:28:17.714
Not even once have they said it.

00:28:17.772 --> 00:28:22.348
Never, or nothing — this is a
materialistic problem or something — never.

00:28:22.372 --> 00:28:24.272
They appear to be worry-free.

00:28:24.289 --> 00:28:32.038
Although... ... ... Look into their
eyes, such concentration; even if

00:28:32.062 --> 00:28:40.839
someone speaks a single word in Hindi,
they will listen with full attention.

00:28:46.589 --> 00:28:49.215
Nothing can be heard, oh!
How are vibrations emitting

00:28:49.239 --> 00:28:52.170
from them, how are the
vibrations coming into the hands?

00:28:52.237 --> 00:28:54.988
Which vibrations need to be corrected,
what is the problem?

00:28:55.013 --> 00:28:57.296
[Unclear] Look, they gave their
whole life to Sahaja Yoga; and—

00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:59.255
They can't give anything else.

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:03.263
Alright then, we’ll do
this too, we’ll do that too.

00:29:05.213 --> 00:29:07.595
Only by giving your whole life
to Sahaja Yoga you truly grow.

00:29:07.619 --> 00:29:10.679
This is also something I have to tell
you. You have nothing to lose in this.

00:29:10.682 --> 00:29:11.682
You don’t fall short of anything.

00:29:17.296 --> 00:29:19.391
Your whole life should
be given to Sahaja Yoga,

00:29:19.415 --> 00:29:21.830
every single moment should
be given for Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:21.854 --> 00:29:26.813
The meaning of Sahaj is to act spontaneously;
spontaneous—anytime, in any way.

00:29:26.847 --> 00:29:35.830
Sahaja Yoga is a living, blissful power.

00:29:35.897 --> 00:29:43.680
And then you won’t even
need to think [Unclear].

00:29:43.768 --> 00:29:46.398
Because you people still
cannot enjoy; the one who truly

00:29:46.422 --> 00:29:49.051
enjoys is only the Paramatma.
You cannot enjoy anything.

00:29:49.103 --> 00:29:52.443
You are under the illusion
that you are enjoying something;

00:29:52.443 --> 00:29:55.861
You simply cannot enjoy. The
enjoyer is also Paramatma, and He

00:29:55.885 --> 00:29:59.303
is the Creator, and He is
[Unclear: “the creation too”]. You—

00:29:59.303 --> 00:30:04.063
You are just like a  ‘wipe’ in between,
that’s how you are, so just observe—

00:30:04.063 --> 00:30:08.883
And if you do not do anything,
if you do one thing, then Paramatma has

00:30:08.883 --> 00:30:12.051
Immense love for you.
But this is the only act

00:30:12.075 --> 00:30:15.243
you can do — to remain
completely in bliss.

00:30:15.243 --> 00:30:18.383
Completely — otherwise, you cannot clearly

00:30:18.383 --> 00:30:23.410
visualise anything else. Because the
one who enjoys anything is only Him.

00:30:23.435 --> 00:30:28.210
That’s the thing — today you got one thing,

00:30:28.244 --> 00:30:34.302
Then tomorrow you got another,
then a third, even then no satisfaction.

00:30:34.327 --> 00:30:38.893
We should speak to God, only the one
who enjoys everything must always enjoy it.

00:30:38.944 --> 00:30:44.027
Why do we, or you, need to enjoy anything?

00:30:44.052 --> 00:30:49.092
Only that’s the joy that He
created the entire creation —

00:30:49.117 --> 00:30:52.515
such a beautiful world,
so many things have been

00:30:52.539 --> 00:30:55.937
given to us, and now
you’ve become Sahaja Yogis.

00:30:55.962 --> 00:31:00.623
Within us, we can know God,
we can recognize ourselves.

00:31:00.648 --> 00:31:03.164
We can recognize the spirit in others;

00:31:03.189 --> 00:31:06.859
Because if the grace of
God is upon us — just thinking

00:31:06.883 --> 00:31:10.414
and thinking of this, even
that becomes possible.

00:31:10.439 --> 00:31:13.598
When you begin to enjoy
God this way, then you

00:31:13.622 --> 00:31:16.780
will see that your hand
gives you realization.

00:31:16.805 --> 00:31:20.921
[Unclear: In the entire
creation you... ... ... ]

00:31:20.922 --> 00:31:25.605
This is my message to you today.

00:31:25.638 --> 00:31:31.863
Start connecting with God, forget all other
enjoyments and begin to enjoy just God,

00:31:31.863 --> 00:31:36.063
and if you enjoy Him, then what
more would you need from God?

00:31:36.063 --> 00:31:38.301
What more do you need?
What more do you need?

00:31:38.325 --> 00:31:40.563
You will be able to
enjoy that. You will see—

00:31:40.596 --> 00:31:45.963
You will see your life will
be completely transformed.

00:31:46.013 --> 00:31:52.688
After coming into Sahaja Yoga,
every moment we should be thinking—

00:31:52.713 --> 00:31:55.928
What have we received? What
have we received? We have received

00:31:55.952 --> 00:31:58.849
so much, so much, so much;
we keep saying so. Come on.

00:31:58.874 --> 00:32:06.507
First of all, your complaints will never
end. And you keep searching for vibrations.

00:32:06.524 --> 00:32:11.540
Now if you have any questions, then ask.

00:32:11.541 --> 00:32:13.048
[ Seeker asks some question]

00:32:13.072 --> 00:32:16.371
Shri Mata ji: I told them that
what is the enjoy. [inaudible]

00:32:16.372 --> 00:32:21.505
You can only enjoy God, and that is
the greatest thing you have ever seen,

00:32:21.588 --> 00:32:25.305
what God has created for you. [inaudible:
what are you going to say about this]

00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:29.971
He has given you human awareness by
which you can know how much he has done,

00:32:30.015 --> 00:32:33.448
how much he has worked for you, how
much he has brought you to this level,

00:32:33.448 --> 00:32:38.738
what he has given you, you can give
to others, you can make others happy.

00:32:38.763 --> 00:32:43.752
If you take like that, immediately
you will know the science.

00:32:43.777 --> 00:32:44.777
Sit.

00:32:44.801 --> 00:33:16.002
[INAUDIBLE: SEEMS SOME
SEEKER MAY BE QUESTIONING.]

00:33:16.026 --> 00:33:20.176
Left heart to right,
Why left heart is catching?

00:33:20.225 --> 00:33:25.658
Because God doesn't have time, thank Him!

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:27.564
sahaj Yogi : Maa!
Why there is question of

00:33:27.588 --> 00:33:30.846
dipression without being guilt?
Shri Mata ji: Without being .. ?

00:33:30.871 --> 00:33:37.338
Sahaja Yogi: Guilty. Shri Mata Ji:
You see first he asked me the question,

00:33:37.421 --> 00:33:43.803
" Why there is dippresion
without being guilty?"

00:33:43.853 --> 00:33:47.808
If one get possessed,
you feel to get possessed,

00:33:47.832 --> 00:33:51.787
but somehow you never
reach poise.

00:33:51.827 --> 00:33:54.169
who talk of separation.

00:33:54.194 --> 00:34:00.127
You need some quarenstile,

00:34:00.144 --> 00:34:07.500
you allow brothers to
attend in Sahaj Yoga.

00:34:07.525 --> 00:34:10.484
Don’t you listen to
Sahaja Yoga with great

00:34:10.508 --> 00:34:13.975
interest? [Unclear] Then
whom do you listen to?

00:34:14.058 --> 00:34:22.758
[Unclear: "Some conversation
with Sahaja Yogis"]

00:34:22.782 --> 00:34:50.187
[Unclear: "Some conversation
with Sahaja Yogis"]

00:34:50.211 --> 00:34:54.032
Very surprising, because in the
Granth Sahib all about the realized

00:34:54.056 --> 00:34:57.761
souls’ [Unclear: is written].
Here, sorrow is definitely there.

00:34:57.795 --> 00:35:02.744
There is no doubt about this;
depression must certainly happen here.

00:35:02.794 --> 00:35:10.378
That's why like fools they keep
reading them, do nothing. [Unclear]

00:35:10.424 --> 00:35:13.570
Even in Gurudwaras, in
the Granth Sahib, there’s

00:35:13.594 --> 00:35:16.740
nothing that isn’t specially
found in Nanak Sahib.

00:35:16.774 --> 00:35:21.740
But he included all the realized
souls—what Kabir, all, whoever he found.

00:35:21.741 --> 00:35:25.777
Be it Kabir or Nagdev,
whoever they were—he compiled

00:35:25.801 --> 00:35:29.440
the Granth Sahib with
all the realized souls.

00:35:29.506 --> 00:35:35.357
But those who read it must themselves be
depressive—what can be done about that?

00:35:35.391 --> 00:35:42.857
All those whose minds
are messed up—God save!

00:35:42.882 --> 00:35:45.773
Because… [Unclear]

00:35:45.798 --> 00:35:49.220
And secondly, it's a place
where they don’t know

00:35:49.244 --> 00:35:53.032
about realized souls,
nothing—they read like fools.

00:35:53.118 --> 00:35:56.964
Nanak Sahib said everything—he
said, search what is inside;

00:35:56.988 --> 00:36:00.634
search! They're just reading
“search, search, search.”

00:36:00.659 --> 00:36:03.967
[Unclear]

00:36:04.008 --> 00:36:07.513
This will definitely lead to
depression if you mix up with

00:36:07.537 --> 00:36:11.351
such people. If you dwell with
such people, you won’t ascend.

00:36:11.376 --> 00:36:17.250
Having attained it, by
staying with such people—

00:36:17.275 --> 00:36:19.001
—joy.

00:36:19.026 --> 00:36:24.580

00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:41.090

00:37:29.988 --> 00:37:30.988
Everyone will
meet in the morning.

Sahaja Yogi: Mataji, we
will come after having food!

00:37:59.632 --> 00:38:04.381
Shri Mataji: Alright.

00:38:04.432 --> 00:38:07.788
This, which is more from our left
side—[unclear]—you understood, right?

00:38:07.813 --> 00:38:11.563
Put the left side inward,
and the right side outward.

00:38:11.596 --> 00:38:14.246
At night, you should not
roam around too much.

00:38:14.271 --> 00:38:18.871
Another thing is, like listening
to the stories of dead souls—

00:38:18.888 --> 00:38:24.212
This should not be done. [Unclear...]
Look deep within—it’s very good.

00:38:24.237 --> 00:38:28.820
Things that are meant to frighten, etc.,
are very powerful—you should avoid them.

00:38:28.845 --> 00:38:32.768
It’s very surprising—in this, the whole
scene is seen by realized souls, and

00:38:32.793 --> 00:38:36.043
how possession
happens is written in it,

00:38:36.043 --> 00:38:41.151
what depression
is like, what it does.

00:38:41.176 --> 00:38:44.642
What happens is—depression also comes from
this—that the person becomes possessed.

00:38:44.693 --> 00:38:46.309
This is the worst of all.

00:38:46.333 --> 00:38:48.807
For that we have ['inaudible…'] in
Sahaja Yoga, not 'outside Sahaja.'

00:38:48.831 --> 00:38:51.499
For that, there is [unclear] in Sahaja
Yoga—not something outside Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:51.596 --> 00:38:58.112
So, keep your left hand on your left side
and your right hand outward in this manner.

00:38:58.145 --> 00:39:00.574
Everything is written
down, so you should come

00:39:00.598 --> 00:39:03.298
to the center; because
so that, you are [unclear]

00:39:03.345 --> 00:39:08.090
In correction mode—what is
written in Sahaja Yoga—[unclear]

00:39:08.115 --> 00:39:12.406
It has to be done every day, washing
of the feet has to be done every day;

00:39:12.431 --> 00:39:19.772
It is just a, more important than just
bathing. It is much much more important,

00:39:19.797 --> 00:39:27.797
as well as is a snana, is a
bath, every day you have to do it.

00:39:27.822 --> 00:39:36.013
[Unclear conversation]

00:39:36.037 --> 00:39:39.147
Shri Mataji: Alright!

00:39:39.172 --> 00:39:41.955
Sahaja Yogi: Mother! I just want
to ask one thing. Shri Mataji: What?

00:39:42.046 --> 00:39:44.388
Sahaja Yogi: I want to ask you
a question. Shri Mataji: What?

00:39:44.422 --> 00:39:47.202
Whether different *asanas*
(postures) for different

00:39:47.226 --> 00:39:50.005
chakras can be beneficial
for Sahaja Yogis, I mean,

00:39:50.038 --> 00:39:54.263
can it be helpful if different...
Shri Mataji: Yes, they should do it.

00:39:54.288 --> 00:39:57.796
Then please suggest
*asanas* for different chakras.

00:39:57.821 --> 00:39:59.775
Shri Mataji: Look, Sahaja
Yoga is something that

00:39:59.799 --> 00:40:02.004
comes from inside to
outside, not outside to inside.

00:40:02.055 --> 00:40:06.504
Understand? Sahaja Yogi: Okay!

00:40:06.538 --> 00:40:10.971
First, correct your chakras,
then come to your mind.

00:40:10.988 --> 00:40:14.151
First observe your mind;
until you've corrected

00:40:14.175 --> 00:40:17.338
your chakras physically,
that won’t be resolved.

00:40:17.388 --> 00:40:21.133
So then think
about what is living!

00:40:21.133 --> 00:40:28.871
What rises from within— from this alone,
all the power spreads in all directions.

00:40:28.896 --> 00:40:32.594
Now, what’s the use if you’ve only
made your outer surroundings good,

00:40:32.618 --> 00:40:36.316
and inside, if [unclear: some worm
rises, then how will the worm…]?

00:40:36.341 --> 00:40:39.329
That’s why I don’t
profess *asanas* much.

00:40:39.372 --> 00:40:43.288
If the *asanas* are everything ,
then everyone will just sit doing it;

00:40:43.308 --> 00:40:46.528
I’ve seen that if I tell someone one
*asana*, they keep doing only that—oh!

00:40:46.553 --> 00:40:50.605
I said, your [unclear: thing is now
cured], then why are you still doing it?

00:40:50.606 --> 00:40:52.555
That’s why I don’t
emphasize *asanas* too much.

00:40:52.622 --> 00:40:58.093
Actually, inside us is a tendency
that we must do something.

00:40:58.093 --> 00:41:01.392
If I say, “Stand on your
head every day,” then better

00:41:01.416 --> 00:41:05.034
than breaking your head,
just stand firmly on the truth.

00:41:05.059 --> 00:41:08.526
Somehow, the man must
has to do some such thing.

00:41:08.551 --> 00:41:15.000
If there’s nothing else,
then go hang from the fan.

00:41:15.018 --> 00:41:19.975
We can’t even sit peacefully for
five minutes—this is the misery.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.762
Now if I start teaching
*asanas*, then in a few days,

00:41:22.786 --> 00:41:25.548
you’ll see everyone doing
gymnastics in front of me.

00:41:25.573 --> 00:41:31.256
So, it’s better, ‘Baba’! just meditate.
We don’t need any *asanas*.

00:41:31.281 --> 00:41:36.473
So, if we say what happens
just by doing asanas,

00:41:36.498 --> 00:41:40.831
otherwise I’ve seen people—when I told them
about *Bahastrika*, their attention breaks.

00:41:40.856 --> 00:41:42.742
I saw people [unclear:
while meditating], I said,

00:41:42.766 --> 00:41:44.573
"’Bhai’, is this meditation
or something else

00:41:44.597 --> 00:41:46.342
going on?" If at all
something is there, then its the

00:41:46.366 --> 00:41:48.314
attention. [unclear]—so it is
all what is happening here?

00:41:48.381 --> 00:41:53.148
Even *bandhan*, giving *bandhan* also has
its own charm when you sit in meditation.

00:41:53.172 --> 00:41:55.802
So that you can keep
your mind set. These are all

00:41:55.826 --> 00:41:59.172
external—*bandhan*; You are
saying, you people on their way.

00:41:59.197 --> 00:42:12.089
[Unclear]

00:42:12.114 --> 00:42:15.672
First fix your mind;
if you're complaining,

00:42:15.696 --> 00:42:19.763
then your mind needs
to be set right. If you’re

00:42:19.763 --> 00:42:22.143
aggressive, your mind
needs to be corrected.

00:42:22.167 --> 00:42:24.546
Correct the mind
first—the mind comes first.

00:42:24.571 --> 00:42:28.854
Everything arises from the
mind—get control over the mind.

00:42:28.879 --> 00:42:33.945
If your hand or foot is actually
broken, then that you can get treated.

00:42:33.970 --> 00:42:36.687
But now even that can
be healed by Kundalini.

00:42:36.712 --> 00:42:39.466
That’s why *asanas*
shouldn’t be given too much

00:42:39.490 --> 00:42:42.243
focus— first attention
on God, first attain God,

00:42:42.243 --> 00:42:48.288
letting go the power of God, don’t you find
it strange, all this obsession with asanas?

00:42:48.313 --> 00:42:53.023
Doesn't it seem strange?

00:42:53.023 --> 00:43:01.006
Like one gentleman, he said
his plane got missed. [Unclear]

00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:04.226
Now he came and slept in
our drawing room. He said,

00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:07.373
“I’m a great yogi.” I
said, “Alright, now what?”

00:43:07.385 --> 00:43:09.918
He said, “I sleep
on a hard cot.”

00:43:09.943 --> 00:43:13.261
I said, “We don’t have
a cot here. This is a

00:43:13.285 --> 00:43:17.222
‘Deevan’— you can sleep
on it, sleep comfortably.”

00:43:17.263 --> 00:43:24.379
He said, “I don’t sleep on just anything.”
So I said, “Then sleep on the floor,

00:43:24.413 --> 00:43:28.479
do whatever you like.” He said,
“Wake me up at four o'clock.”

00:43:28.504 --> 00:43:30.602
We said, “Brother, we’ll
wake you up. My wife wakes

00:43:30.626 --> 00:43:32.723
up at four, she’ll wake
you too—now go to sleep.”

00:43:32.723 --> 00:43:40.323
Now if you create a
nuisance for others, [unclear]

00:43:40.356 --> 00:43:48.298
[Unclear] You go to
someone’s house—

00:43:48.323 --> 00:43:54.056
[Unclear] What happened? He saw it was
already five o’clock! I said, “What happened?”

00:43:54.065 --> 00:44:01.954
Sahab said that as soon as he
went inside, he saw him lying like this!

00:44:02.004 --> 00:44:05.971
[Unclear] “What should
I do now?” I said, “Let

00:44:05.995 --> 00:44:09.962
it go— Good thing you
didn’t ask...” [Unclear]

00:44:09.987 --> 00:44:15.014
[Inaudible]

00:44:15.039 --> 00:44:20.205
He said, “So then what should be
done? What’s the treatment for this?”

00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:21.667
I said, “Just keep doing
this—what else?” He

00:44:21.691 --> 00:44:23.397
said, “I even tried leaving
it like this and saw…”

00:44:23.422 --> 00:44:26.335
So just sitting, sitting,
sitting like this [unclear],

00:44:26.359 --> 00:44:29.272
it doesn't make sense—there's
something else going on.

00:44:29.367 --> 00:44:32.198
Even before, the same [unclear]

00:44:32.223 --> 00:44:38.089
[Unclear]

00:44:38.156 --> 00:44:45.006
There shouldn’t be such a thing
that someone else sees and [unclear]

00:44:45.031 --> 00:44:52.931
[Unclear: such a spectacle], there is
no need for all this drama [..unclear]

00:44:52.966 --> 00:44:57.003
Like in Sahaja Yoga, Kundalini
rises up [unclear] Now look, one

00:44:57.027 --> 00:45:01.848
gentleman used to do *asanas*, it
took twenty years to wean him off them.

00:45:01.899 --> 00:45:05.395
Whenever he came to the
program, his acrobatics would begin. If

00:45:05.419 --> 00:45:08.915
you told him to raise his hands,
he would lift his legs instead.

00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:13.640
[Inaudible]

00:45:13.665 --> 00:45:19.011
Sahaja Yoga is a magnificent
thing. Why have you gone searching

00:45:19.035 --> 00:45:24.122
for all this? [Unclear] There
is no need for any *asanas*.

00:45:24.123 --> 00:45:27.439
Understand which of
your chakras are caught.

00:45:27.490 --> 00:45:29.459
Sahaja Yogi: [Unclear] Shri
Mataji: [Hain] What! Sahaja

00:45:29.483 --> 00:45:31.306
Yogi: How will sleep
come, Shri Mataji! [Unclear]

00:45:31.323 --> 00:45:36.422
Shri Mataji: [Hain]
What! [Unclear]

00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:41.972
Suppose sleep comes, [unclear]
it is the tendency of the mind.

00:45:42.037 --> 00:45:45.286
[Hindi phrase means]
Once one gets detached with

00:45:45.310 --> 00:45:48.558
the mind, the wish of
the mind gets full filled.

00:45:48.583 --> 00:45:53.198
It’s the mind, the mind
that is seated there.

00:45:53.223 --> 00:45:57.285
You went looking here and
there, do this, do that—‘Bha’

00:45:57.309 --> 00:46:01.220
what for, why are you
doing this? Enjoy peacefully.

00:46:01.245 --> 00:46:09.245
I already said that you have to experience
the fire of the Divine, and [audio break]

00:46:09.270 --> 00:46:11.440
When a person is like
this, asked him about the

00:46:11.464 --> 00:46:14.061
lecture, there is no
attention—then its not all right.

00:46:14.086 --> 00:46:19.086
I was even getting done some thing
in the early stages but they were not

00:46:19.110 --> 00:46:24.604
accepting it. Otherwise, silently take
the breath down, bring it up [unclear]

00:46:24.629 --> 00:46:28.087
Until something disastrous
doesn’t happen to them [unclear]

00:46:28.112 --> 00:46:35.679
Please come in,
be seated! [Unclear]

00:46:35.729 --> 00:46:39.669
This is like a feast—understand
that you’re at a feast. And if

00:46:39.693 --> 00:46:43.633
someone starts doing *asanas*
at a feast, what will people say?

00:46:43.658 --> 00:46:50.174
It’s for enjoyment—you enjoy it. Why
are you creating chaos for no reason?

00:46:50.237 --> 00:46:58.232
This thing doesn’t make sense
that creating chaos [unclear]

00:46:58.266 --> 00:47:02.632
Whoever understands this
point, they will get realization.

00:47:02.653 --> 00:47:08.360
[Unclear]

00:47:08.394 --> 00:47:11.385
[Unclear: That Lang
Sahib...] He couldn’t do

00:47:11.409 --> 00:47:14.401
anything, he read the
entire Ramayana, read

00:47:14.425 --> 00:47:19.210
the Bhagavata too. He didn’t leave anything,
did every odd thing—you did everything!

00:47:19.234 --> 00:47:23.614
What in this life, what in the previous
life, what in the life before that?

00:47:23.639 --> 00:47:26.756
Now, when the time has come
to reap the fruit— so why are you

00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:29.897
doing *asanas*? You’re offering
someone fruit to eat, and they…

00:47:29.922 --> 00:47:33.313
[Unclear]

00:47:33.338 --> 00:47:38.280
Yogi: Shri Mataji, should one bathe before
sitting for meditation in the morning?

00:47:38.305 --> 00:47:41.080
Shri Mataji: Not necessary.

00:47:41.122 --> 00:47:47.238
It’s not necessary to bathe—if your body’s
[unclear: condition is fine], then just sit.

00:47:47.263 --> 00:47:53.959
If it’s not fine, then do bathe.
[Unclear] Bathing and washing is all

00:47:53.983 --> 00:47:59.951
[unclear]—cleanse the mind. First and
foremost, the mind should be clean. A

00:47:59.975 --> 00:48:06.671
person who is cleansing the mind— [unclear]
before that, even that dirt, [unclear]

00:48:06.705 --> 00:48:08.844
Once [inaudible], said
something and caught a cold.

00:48:08.868 --> 00:48:10.963
I said, "You take a
bath”; I said, "Alright then

00:48:10.988 --> 00:48:14.918
take three names”. He didn’t
believe. As soon as he took the

00:48:14.942 --> 00:48:18.871
three names, no bad smell
in the nose or body. [inaudible]

00:48:18.929 --> 00:48:26.929
Why bathe? Three days without bathing.
You people don’t bathe? [inaudible]

00:48:26.979 --> 00:48:29.623
Sahaj Yogi: [inaudible] Shri Mataji:
[‘Haan’] What! Sahaj Yogi: Some people

00:48:29.647 --> 00:48:32.291
don’t bathe for a whole month there,
and still they don’t have any problem.

00:48:32.316 --> 00:48:40.316
Shri Mataji: Hmm! Sahaj Yogi: Those
people also... [inaudible conversation]

00:48:40.349 --> 00:48:44.337
Those people are not at all
clean. [inaudible] People should

00:48:44.361 --> 00:48:48.349
bathe daily. Those who should
bathe, are exactly those people.

00:48:48.383 --> 00:48:56.382
And like us... [inaudible]

00:48:56.406 --> 00:49:02.955
Meaning bathing and washing
is not at all necessary. This all...

00:49:03.045 --> 00:49:07.564
I am telling about extreme cases. But
such people must bathe daily, extreme

00:49:07.588 --> 00:49:12.108
[inaudible] Very dirty, extremely
dirty. [inaudible] Ask them. They don’t

00:49:12.132 --> 00:49:16.279
even think they’re dirty,
[inaudible: they think they’re clean.]

00:49:16.313 --> 00:49:20.297
If they have to get vibrations, they
will; if we don’t, then fine. They are

00:49:20.321 --> 00:49:24.305
very dirty people. They smell a lot. I
make them wash their hands six times.

00:49:24.330 --> 00:49:28.045
They go to the bathroom
and don’t even wash their

00:49:28.069 --> 00:49:31.629
hands afterward. Such
filthy people they are!

00:49:31.654 --> 00:49:36.068
These people are all... [inaudible]
Did a lot for these people; As for us...

00:49:36.093 --> 00:49:39.180
In collectivity, if there's
household dirt, throw

00:49:39.204 --> 00:49:42.227
it in the trash. Outwardly
it should be clean.

00:49:42.227 --> 00:49:45.443
They themselves will bathe,
but their children... [inaudible]

00:49:45.444 --> 00:49:48.002
It’s very cold there,
and they have it a lot.

00:49:48.026 --> 00:49:50.935
They’ll keep the outside
cleaner than the inside.

00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:57.493
Whatever the
thing is... it’s dirty.

00:49:57.527 --> 00:50:01.877
Bathing and washing does
give some freshness to the body.

00:50:01.977 --> 00:50:06.568
But it's not necessary that if you
haven’t bathed, you can't meditate.

00:50:06.594 --> 00:50:13.560
This is what I keep
saying... [inaudible]

00:50:13.610 --> 00:50:17.843
When you practise this, if you bathe, fine;
If you skip one day, what’s the big deal?

00:50:17.881 --> 00:50:21.763
Nothing is above you.
Everything is below you.

00:50:21.847 --> 00:50:25.296
If you bathe, it’s good.
[inaudible] Did you hear their story?
