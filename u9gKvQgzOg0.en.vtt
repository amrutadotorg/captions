00:00:04.493 --> 00:00:11.537
We have to understand that we have risen above our human awareness

00:00:11.617 --> 00:00:19.663
and at that level we were different and at this new awareness we are different people

00:00:19.743 --> 00:00:22.939
and all our priorities must change.

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:25.413
Our value system has to change,

00:00:25.493 --> 00:00:31.157
and if it has not changed automatically 
we have to little bit deliberately work it out.

00:00:31.237 --> 00:00:36.230
Or else we have to see that 
we become really the Spirit

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:43.093
and no more of all the falsehood of human 
awareness should be attached to us

00:00:43.173 --> 00:00:45.742
or we should be bothered about it.

00:00:45.822 --> 00:00:52.099
The, if you see, the principle of everything, 
as I see, the principle of everything,

00:00:52.179 --> 00:01:00.572
rather human endeavor, whatever it is, 
it is based on gathering property.

00:01:00.652 --> 00:01:06.389
Whether it is communism, 
or it is democracy

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:13.491
or socialism or anything, it’s all going 
round and round to the point of property.

00:01:13.571 --> 00:01:17.845
Property, that may be land, that 
may be money, that may be anything.

00:01:17.925 --> 00:01:23.308
All economic activity surrounds 
that one point, is property.

00:01:23.388 --> 00:01:29.225
So the democracy, though
it’s a political organization

00:01:29.305 --> 00:01:33.244
or political theory, actually is based 
on something very economic,

00:01:33.324 --> 00:01:36.585
economical thing called property.

00:01:36.665 --> 00:01:41.489
Then, same about communism, 
we can say; it’s the same thing,

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:53.431
to, how to distribute the property, how to have the
property equally, how to make everybody self-sufficient.

00:01:53.511 --> 00:01:57.509
But as soon as you become a realized soul,

00:01:57.589 --> 00:02:03.503
you have to know that your properties 
and your priorities are very different.

00:02:03.583 --> 00:02:09.580
Your property is your Spirit 
and your priorities are

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.095
where you can manifest your Spirit 
and can feel the Spirit of others.

00:02:15.175 --> 00:02:25.312
So the whole concept that was so far 
obstructing you and limiting your understanding

00:02:25.392 --> 00:02:31.339
changes into an unlimited area where 
you start thinking of the Spirit.

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:39.903
Now in that concept of the Spirit, 
the property of the Spirit is twofold.

00:02:39.983 --> 00:02:45.884
One in its nature, the nature of the Spirit is, 
as we call it, sat chit ananda,

00:02:45.964 --> 00:02:49.477
means it is the joy.

00:02:49.557 --> 00:02:54.735
Then it’s the truth. It tells 
you the truth all the times.

00:02:54.815 --> 00:02:57.899
It gives you discretion, divine discretion,

00:02:57.979 --> 00:03:06.644
and chit, the attention that acts, 
that works, that gives you all the information.

00:03:06.724 --> 00:03:13.957
So you have got the nature of the 
Spirit thus felt within yourself.

00:03:14.037 --> 00:03:24.981
But on the other side, what does it want 
or what are its duties or why to be the Spirit is?

00:03:25.061 --> 00:03:33.110
Such questions arise later on when we are 
about to enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.714
Why to enter into the Kingdom of God?

00:03:35.794 --> 00:03:47.015
So in outside and, we can say, all the manifestations 
of the Spirit is, that it is benevolent.

00:03:47.095 --> 00:03:49.642
It is hita cari.

00:03:49.722 --> 00:03:53.924
It gives benevolence to others.

00:03:54.004 --> 00:03:57.925
It gives you benevolence and it 
gives benevolence to others, also.

00:03:58.005 --> 00:04:01.929
The only joy in that is benevolence.

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:08.825
And you think of all these material things, 
which are so important otherwise,

00:04:08.905 --> 00:04:14.848
as if they are for giving it to someone 
just to express your love.

00:04:14.928 --> 00:04:19.371
So the benevolence that comes through love,

00:04:19.451 --> 00:04:26.666
benevolence doesn’t come through 
oppression or suppression or by intimidation

00:04:26.746 --> 00:04:32.463
but it comes only through love, and if you 
have faith in your love you can work it out.
