00:06:15.057 --> 00:06:22.257
Today we are going to worship Shri Ganesha.

00:06:38.387 --> 00:06:45.227
Shri Ganesha resides in Mooladhara,

00:06:45.427 --> 00:06:51.677
on the chakra, Mooladhara chakra.

00:06:53.729 --> 00:07:06.086
and not on mooladhar.
In the mooladhar is placed the Kundalini.

00:07:06.087 --> 00:07:19.277
She is the mother of Shri Ganesh, we call
her Gauri. Yesterday you saw the picture,

00:07:19.277 --> 00:07:40.496
the drama, how Shri Ganesha got his head of
an elephant. All these things have happened

00:07:40.496 --> 00:08:06.536
in another world. There
are many worlds of which we know of this world,

00:08:06.536 --> 00:08:23.537
is a question of our awareness. Now we are
at a human awareness, and we have risen to

00:08:23.537 --> 00:08:40.586
a higher awareness which is called as the
fourth dimension. Without Shri Ganesha it

00:08:40.586 --> 00:08:56.347
is not possible. As you know he is the symbol
of innocence within us. This innocence never

00:08:56.347 --> 00:09:12.387
gets destroyed because it is eternal. But
it may happen that it will get covered with

00:09:12.387 --> 00:09:29.985
some clouds by our mistakes that we commit.
But once you get your realization, your innocence

00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:49.328
is re-established, it manifests. And you become
innocent, your attention becomes innocent.

00:09:49.329 --> 00:10:01.843
It is impossible to follow your religion,
either Christ or Mohammed-Sahib or Jews, if

00:10:01.844 --> 00:10:19.642
you do not have enlightenment.This is one
thing they did not realize, because they were

00:10:19.643 --> 00:10:35.167
of a very high level people. They did not
know what is the condition of human beings.

00:10:38.017 --> 00:10:45.533
As in the Bible is written that if your right
eye commits sins – means goes against Shri

00:10:45.534 --> 00:10:50.650
Ganesha- you take it away.

00:10:56.318 --> 00:11:05.517
Or if your righthand does anything wrong against Shri Ganesha,
then cut it out.

00:11:09.783 --> 00:11:15.950
Just imagine, if Christians
were really practising Christianity, they

00:11:15.951 --> 00:11:20.767
all would have been without hands, without
eyes.

00:11:25.333 --> 00:11:28.933
Because it is said that if you make

00:11:28.934 --> 00:11:35.850
any mistakes you better cut out, yourself.

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:40.933
Christ said that you should do it, and also

00:11:40.934 --> 00:11:45.383
for men he was very strict, not for women
so much.

00:11:50.667 --> 00:11:54.433
So Mohammed-Saheb thought , that

00:11:54.434 --> 00:11:58.900
why not say about women also?

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:02.867
Why not restrictthem, why only men?

00:12:06.833 --> 00:12:13.183
So he made strict rules for women also.

00:12:15.417 --> 00:12:22.167
In this case he said that you should hurt the woman or hit the woman

00:12:22.168 --> 00:12:27.132
or should try to restrict the woman, that
is on the husband.

00:12:35.118 --> 00:12:38.150
But to do so, the husband

00:12:38.257 --> 00:12:45.589
himself has to be an innocent person. what

00:12:48.019 --> 00:12:53.830
If he himself committed such mistakes, then

00:12:53.867 --> 00:13:00.950
What right he has got to become strict with his wife or with his sister?

00:13:11.202 --> 00:13:13.950
And the worst thing was, were the Jews,

00:13:13.968 --> 00:13:19.810
when Moses brought the Ten Commandments, he found that the Jews were

00:13:19.825 --> 00:13:23.800
having a decadent society as they have now.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:42.900
Nowadays we have this decadent society in America, in.. everywhere.

00:13:49.832 --> 00:13:52.332
There are no morals,

00:13:53.902 --> 00:13:55.932
and nobody talks of morality.

00:13:59.956 --> 00:14:07.149
I feel that Sahaj is the only way where human beings can become innocent.

00:14:13.279 --> 00:14:18.443
Because Jews were given what you call the Sheriat (sp?). Where it was , if

00:14:18.429 --> 00:14:26.588
you are a thief , cut your hands, cut your
nose, cut this portion, cut that portion…it is very seriuos.

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:48.990
I saw that it is impossible to follow them because they are too pure,

00:14:48.987 --> 00:14:50.243
too important.

00:14:57.517 --> 00:15:03.872
If you are Christians, you can’t have two
eyes, you can’t have your hands.

00:15:07.652 --> 00:15:14.952
And if you are Muslims, your wives and your daughters and your sisters are always in danger.

00:15:21.611 --> 00:15:27.031
And if you are a Jew then all kinds of punishments are written for them.

00:15:34.607 --> 00:15:36.250
On the contrary , only

00:15:36.234 --> 00:15:41.100
the saints have been punished.

00:15:42.174 --> 00:15:44.674
All the good people are punished.

00:15:45.922 --> 00:15:51.588
Because there are so many people who are extremely aggressive and sinful.

00:15:58.218 --> 00:16:02.094
And they also do not know that there is wrong with them,

00:16:02.085 --> 00:16:06.844
something very much against the dharma, against the religion.

00:16:14.482 --> 00:16:18.702
With Sahaj only , you get the light of the Spirit.

00:16:22.499 --> 00:16:24.999
Shri Ganesha is the Spirit within us.

00:16:28.543 --> 00:16:34.733
And he incarnated on this earth as our lord Jesus Christ.

00:16:40.573 --> 00:16:45.727
But all kinds of things have been done against such great people.

00:16:52.013 --> 00:16:55.569
And they made separate religions.

00:16:57.679 --> 00:17:02.279
None of these books have separated themselves from each other.

00:17:08.009 --> 00:17:17.259
For example, Mohammed-Saheb has described about Moses, Abraham, Christ, Mother of Christ.

00:17:25.266 --> 00:17:31.765
So he never established another religion,

00:17:32.091 --> 00:17:35.941
he was talking about all the religions

00:17:36.841 --> 00:17:40.331
woven together in one.

00:17:42.612 --> 00:17:56.506
But we have now people who do not believe that all the religions are born out of one tree of spirituality.

00:18:02.914 --> 00:18:06.464
They are not only fighting with others, but
among themselves.

00:18:13.374 --> 00:18:18.744
In the name of God they are killing so many people.

00:18:21.453 --> 00:18:25.183
Innocence is the source of love.

00:18:30.764 --> 00:18:39.165
Like small children , when you see them sweetly dancing, you feel such tremendous love for them.

00:18:47.235 --> 00:18:52.843
When you see a little baby, very sweet baby smilingat you,

00:18:52.843 --> 00:18:55.753
you feel tremendous love for that child.

00:19:03.663 --> 00:19:07.017
If you do not respect your innocence,

00:19:07.017 --> 00:19:09.526
you can never be a loving person.

00:19:16.936 --> 00:19:20.167
And without love you cannot know truth.

00:19:28.537 --> 00:19:34.119
Only thing is that we feel rather sometimes awkward,

00:19:34.122 --> 00:19:38.836
sometimes frightened, to love the innocent people.

00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:56.046
The innocent are most harmless people.

00:20:00.733 --> 00:20:05.776
I do not like parents to beat their children at all.

00:20:10.738 --> 00:20:18.988
They are in innocence do something, so you must be really kind to them, and understand them.

00:20:27.756 --> 00:20:35.072
Nowadays, in Russia also, there are
many children who are born realized.

00:20:41.313 --> 00:20:49.755
Because you all are now enlightened, and there are so many great saints who want to be born.

00:20:57.297 --> 00:21:01.648
But you have to be innocent yourself.

00:21:04.066 --> 00:21:10.138
The countries where the children are not respected, children don’t want to be born there.

00:21:16.488 --> 00:21:21.670
There is a minus growth in those countries.

00:21:24.138 --> 00:21:29.638
But in a country like India, where there is so much love for children,

00:21:29.648 --> 00:21:33.878
they want to take birth in India though there is poverty.

00:21:42.449 --> 00:21:48.249
Children don’t understand money and material things.

00:21:50.209 --> 00:21:53.074
They understand love.

00:21:54.206 --> 00:22:01.234
If you don’t have love in your heart, Shri Ganesha cannot shine within you.

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:16.120
Now the difference between a mother and a mother who is very angry with her children is this:

00:22:26.947 --> 00:22:35.943
The mother who loves her child, enjoys everything she has to do for her child,

00:22:41.069 --> 00:22:48.260
while the mother who doesn’t love the child feels that she is doing too much, she can’t do it, it’s too much.

00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:02.968
If you ask her what’s the matter, she will say I have to wash this, I have

00:23:02.973 --> 00:23:08.922
to clean this, I have to look after this child,
all kinds of stories.

00:23:16.227 --> 00:23:23.315
But a mother who is enlightened will love doing all that, and enjoy it.

00:23:29.305 --> 00:23:32.582
She will have respect for her children,

00:23:33.622 --> 00:23:36.465
and she will make them respectable.

00:23:38.262 --> 00:23:44.689
There is no need to be harsh with your children.

00:23:48.062 --> 00:23:54.361
Children are very sensitive and intelligent.

00:23:56.149 --> 00:24:02.419
Maybe among thousands you might find one child who is not so good.

00:24:09.822 --> 00:24:14.954
But later on , they pick
up things from elders, especially from parents,

00:24:14.955 --> 00:24:18.704
and from the atmosphere, and they start becoming
troublesome.

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:45.020
That doesn’t mean that you should not control  and restrict your children, and train them.

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:57.012
Best way is to be yourself innocent and dharmic.

00:25:01.182 --> 00:25:04.533
Ganesha is the basis of morality.

00:25:08.973 --> 00:25:19.819
Moral behavior, when it is lost in a society, that society becomes destroyed.

00:25:23.473 --> 00:25:33.003
Whatever maybe the economic advantages they have, or they have financial advantages, or political advantages,

00:25:34.103 --> 00:25:38.009
but, they get destroyed from within.

00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:52.932
For example, take the case of America, which is supposed to be an affluent country.

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:05.507
Which is doubtful  to me that they are affluent, because they are indebted.

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:16.029
But what is happening there?

00:26:16.804 --> 00:26:21.308
Small children of twelve years are killing and selling drugs.

00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:30.145
In some other countries in the west,

00:26:32.215 --> 00:26:35.448
so many children are killed by the parents.

00:26:42.095 --> 00:26:50.330
Every country which is affluent has some sort of a specialty of immorality.

00:26:57.650 --> 00:27:03.466
They are absolutely violent people, arrogant and egoistical.

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:15.870
Innocence, first of all, absolutely dissolves the ego.

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:26.267
And when you talk to children they make such sweet comments,

00:27:26.313 --> 00:27:31.967
such intelligent comments, that you are amazed how they are saying all these things.

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:45.420
They are extremely affectionate, and extremely kind.

00:27:51.720 --> 00:28:03.600
I’ll tell you a story of some friends went to see the grave of president of America, Kennedy.

00:28:11.494 --> 00:28:17.604
So the child was looking at it, you
see, and everybody was very solemn.

00:28:24.657 --> 00:28:29.151
Then the child turned to his father and mother and said

00:28:29.425 --> 00:28:38.502
“Mommy, why should you put this president under the earth, all the worms will eat him up..

00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:51.075
Why this punishment?”

00:28:52.438 --> 00:28:56.511
There are so many things which you can

00:28:56.511 --> 00:29:04.081
see from these children when they talk, how they describe about other people.

00:29:10.345 --> 00:29:19.149
One day we had gone to the airport,
and one child was doing like that, like that.

00:29:23.379 --> 00:29:28.545
So I said, “What are you doing?”

00:29:28.896 --> 00:29:34.208
He said, “I am trying to tie up these people, they are all off their heads.”

00:29:36.806 --> 00:29:41.605
Like yesterday’s swadisthana chakra, they were.

00:29:43.716 --> 00:29:48.632
So children see also the game, and the whole drama is absurd.

00:29:56.393 --> 00:30:02.776
They are very innocent and so its the easiest thing to give them good manners.

00:30:08.313 --> 00:30:12.356
In the case of Shri Ganesha, you have heard about the story

00:30:12.386 --> 00:30:20.236
that they had given – the parents, the father specially-

00:30:20.296 --> 00:30:27.128
said that the one who will go around the mother earth, I’ll
give him some present.

00:30:36.799 --> 00:30:41.328
And Shri Ganesha thought that look at this Kartikkeya,

00:30:41.328 --> 00:30:49.358
he can go faster because he’s going on this peacock, which is a bird, which can fly,

00:30:49.612 --> 00:30:57.694
what about me? I’m just going on a little rat.

00:31:05.821 --> 00:31:11.906
But as he is the source of all wisdom , in his wise wisdom he thought,

00:31:11.922 --> 00:31:16.006
“My Mother is greater than this Mother earth . ”

00:31:24.781 --> 00:31:30.313
So he went three times around his Mother, and he got the present.

00:31:35.584 --> 00:31:41.533
A person who is innocent is extremely humble.

00:31:41.793 --> 00:31:45.563
He doesn’t try to show off .

00:31:46.294 --> 00:31:48.794
He doesn’t know how to show off.

00:31:50.423 --> 00:31:57.455
For example, Shri Ganesha has a little rat as his conveyance.

00:32:02.614 --> 00:32:10.807
But if you see people who are show offs, they try to buy cars beyond their means,

00:32:10.862 --> 00:32:16.118
with big loans, just to show off that they are rich.

00:32:26.312 --> 00:32:32.402
This is a disease of people who are not innocent.

00:32:33.452 --> 00:32:38.565
And people take advantage of this very much in the world.

00:32:40.965 --> 00:32:45.666
Like in the west, you see, they have designers.

00:32:49.599 --> 00:32:52.825
And they put their stamp as designers.

00:32:54.762 --> 00:32:57.495
And one has to pay a lot for that.

00:33:00.589 --> 00:33:04.984
So if it is on the coat written the designer’s name,

00:33:05.002 --> 00:33:09.674
they always try to show like that, while going on the road.

00:33:15.104 --> 00:33:20.527
But nowadays, they are putting the sign here, of the designer.

00:33:25.957 --> 00:33:31.939
Is a very much in the west, not so much in Russia, but it will come.

00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:41.120
And the enrepreneurs take full advantage of it.

00:33:45.967 --> 00:33:53.189
That way I must say Indians are very very
wise. Not all, but most of them.

00:33:59.764 --> 00:34:06.550
And because they believe in Shri Ganesha, they would not
waste their money for showing off.

00:34:12.137 --> 00:34:18.669
So thus the entrepreneurs take full advantage of the
people who try to show off.

00:34:25.989 --> 00:34:31.149
Innocent person is not bothered about his
own body.

00:34:33.799 --> 00:34:43.300
About any fashions or about any additions to his body,

00:34:43.319 --> 00:34:49.408
like people wear things
just to show off.

00:34:59.189 --> 00:35:04.833
I’m just telling you because all this nonsense is coming to your country.

00:35:13.539 --> 00:35:19.337
I hope you people will understand that

00:35:19.366 --> 00:35:27.357
the greatest quality of beauty of personality
is innocence.

00:35:35.197 --> 00:35:42.427
When the innocence is lost, people play into the hands of these designers

00:35:42.544 --> 00:35:45.044
who make funny clothes.

00:35:54.777 --> 00:36:01.709
They make clothes for women which expose their bodies.

00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:10.122
And the more it exposes, the more it is expensive.

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:22.962
And despite all the cold, they try to wear
clothes which are very scanty.

00:36:27.803 --> 00:36:30.573
And you can’t even look at them.

00:36:32.546 --> 00:36:35.663
But they think no end of themselves.

00:36:38.337 --> 00:36:46.825
And all our films in the west are so horrible now that you just don’t want to see.

00:36:52.813 --> 00:36:58.977
If they make some films out of children which are innocent,

00:36:58.970 --> 00:37:03.419
I tell you they can earn a lot of money.

00:37:17.897 --> 00:37:22.257
The foundation of dharma is Shri Ganesh.

00:37:26.204 --> 00:37:31.557
If you see children, they don’t know how to
tell lies, very difficult.

00:37:35.517 --> 00:37:41.733
And they say things
sometimes which might be embarassing.

00:37:44.274 --> 00:37:49.986
Like one mother was saying in the presence of the
child to her husband

00:37:50.118 --> 00:37:57.292
that the man who is coming in the evening, he eats like a hog.

00:38:11.854 --> 00:38:16.138
So this boy heard it and when that gentleman came

00:38:16.134 --> 00:38:19.628
and started eating , he was looking at him.

00:38:26.028 --> 00:38:29.767
And then he says, “Mother, he doesn’t eat like a hog,

00:38:33.287 --> 00:38:36.021
why did you say that he eats
like a hog?

00:38:39.191 --> 00:38:41.691
You should not tell lies.”

00:38:42.787 --> 00:38:46.286
And the mother was so embarassed.

00:38:46.946 --> 00:38:53.386
So they minimize
also, innocent person by his innocence minimizes

00:38:53.374 --> 00:38:57.423
the judgement of others and criticism of others.

00:39:03.148 --> 00:39:07.761
Because they don’t see things which normally

00:39:07.761 --> 00:39:11.689
a person who is immoral can see.

00:39:16.245 --> 00:39:20.979
Or who is not innocent can see.

00:39:21.815 --> 00:39:28.422
I remember my own granddaughter once she saw a lady in a swimming dress.

00:39:34.525 --> 00:39:40.307
It was a picture. So she said “Hey, you go
and dress up properly,

00:39:40.658 --> 00:39:44.990
otherwise my grandma will be angry with you.

00:39:50.948 --> 00:39:57.807
So when you see all these small little children
talking, the way they behave, the way they

00:39:57.891 --> 00:40:06.760
are innocent, you really enjoy because innocence
is the source of love.

00:40:15.838 --> 00:40:20.104
And it is the source of joy.

00:40:20.884 --> 00:40:27.424
Because if you do not have love , you
cannot enjoy anything.

00:40:31.018 --> 00:40:33.518
And you start criticising

00:40:34.361 --> 00:40:36.071
and judging

00:40:36.548 --> 00:40:40.914
and wasting your energy on nonsensical
things.

00:40:44.661 --> 00:40:48.426
Like the other day I was listening to some good music,

00:40:48.486 --> 00:40:55.256
and the gentleman was singing with his
hands, a little bit more of action.

00:41:05.656 --> 00:41:09.618
But he had closed his eyes and
music was wonderful.

00:41:12.848 --> 00:41:16.008
I really got lost into it.

00:41:18.796 --> 00:41:24.495
But there were some ladies who said what
clothes he was wearing, how he was putting

00:41:24.519 --> 00:41:31.051
his hands, all these superficial things they
were saying, not the essence.

00:41:37.562 --> 00:41:41.286
But innocence takes to the essence.

00:41:44.807 --> 00:41:47.307
And the essence is love.

00:41:50.458 --> 00:41:54.266
Thus we have to understand that the quality of Ganesha

00:41:54.304 --> 00:41:57.957
we must all imbibe within ourselves.

00:42:04.508 --> 00:42:12.658
His quality of innocence which is already
there within us has to be manifested.

00:42:18.828 --> 00:42:27.513
Like I was with one Sahaja yogi in his house, and we had a meeting there of about 25 people.

00:42:33.399 --> 00:42:39.422
And the meeting was over, I thought that he had said that I’ll have my dinner there.

00:42:39.796 --> 00:42:43.982
So I just waited for all of them to go away.

00:42:51.046 --> 00:42:55.741
This gentleman was in the kitchen when they
all went away.

00:42:57.873 --> 00:43:03.234
He came back and he said, “Mother what have you done? Why have they gone?

00:43:03.254 --> 00:43:05.944
I have cooked for all of them.”

00:43:11.926 --> 00:43:14.857
And tears came into his eyes.

00:43:16.377 --> 00:43:24.259
I was so much overwhelmed by
his generosity, by his kindness.

00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:38.420
And when the generosity is done innocently, you are
not even aware of what you are doing.

00:43:45.194 --> 00:43:47.292
You just enjoy your generosity,

00:43:51.132 --> 00:43:55.992
and you don’t bother as to see what is the reaction of another person is.

00:44:02.271 --> 00:44:09.392
We have in our shastras description of such
people.

00:44:12.992 --> 00:44:18.914
Like Shri Rama, he went into the forest

00:44:18.902 --> 00:44:32.614
and there was a very old lady of, what you
call, a tribal area. Very old, only she had

00:44:32.582 --> 00:44:34.966
two teeth left.

00:44:46.068 --> 00:44:48.860
Her name was Shabari.

00:44:50.030 --> 00:45:02.546
And she came before Shri Ram and offered him some
plums, you can say, pears.

00:45:09.910 --> 00:45:15.996
And she very innocently
told him, “See, all these I have tested with my teeth

00:45:16.027 --> 00:45:21.016
and those who are sour I have
thrown away because you don’t like sour ones.

00:45:21.044 --> 00:45:22.676
But they are all sweet.”

00:45:36.777 --> 00:45:40.477
Normally in India people don’t eat anything which

00:45:40.506 --> 00:45:45.872
has been touched by another mouth.

00:45:50.524 --> 00:45:53.874
So Shri Ram says “Oh , I see, you have done this

00:45:53.924 --> 00:45:57.534
work, so please may I have all these?”

00:46:04.110 --> 00:46:07.520
But his brother Lakshmana was angry, what is this

00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:12.030
lady she has no manners?

00:46:14.767 --> 00:46:22.135
So when she started putting this pear into the mouth of Shri Rama , he was getting even worse.

00:46:28.943 --> 00:46:35.456
So she said “See how carefully I have done this testing and

00:46:35.476 --> 00:46:41.056
you are enjoying , otherwise you would not
have enjoyed them.”

00:46:48.308 --> 00:46:53.040
And here Lakshmana was getting angry, very angry.

00:46:56.447 --> 00:47:03.787
So Shri Rama says, “Oh, what wonderful fruits, I have never eaten such fruits in my lifetime.”

00:47:10.277 --> 00:47:14.517
So his wife Sita she said “Why don’t you give me some?”

00:47:18.957 --> 00:47:22.947
He said “No, no these are for me, I can’t give you.”

00:47:26.267 --> 00:47:34.382
So Sitaji said that “After all, I am your wife, and you have to share everything with me.”

00:47:39.194 --> 00:47:45.477
So he said, “All right, as a matter of right, I am giving you.”

00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:51.889
So he gave those pears, those fruits to her.

00:47:54.973 --> 00:48:02.339
So Sita said, “What? This is just like ambrosia, such beautiful fruits I have never
eaten!”

00:48:08.143 --> 00:48:10.473
So she tells her brother in law,

00:48:10.530 --> 00:48:15.962
“See, what fruits, these are heavenly fruits!”

00:48:19.271 --> 00:48:21.771
So he got tempted.

00:48:22.741 --> 00:48:27.744
So Lakshmana said, “Give me some to taste also.”

00:48:28.563 --> 00:48:34.556
So Sitaji said “No no no, I am not going to share, after all,

00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:42.349
I have got it with great difficulty from your
brother, I am not going to share.”

00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:51.169
So Shri Rama said, “all right, give him some.”

00:48:52.946 --> 00:48:58.146
So this innocent old lady says, “No, I have some more, I can give him.

00:49:03.496 --> 00:49:09.628
You can have your
share, I have some more, I can give him.”

00:49:12.699 --> 00:49:15.423
And she gave it to Lakshmana.

00:49:16.523 --> 00:49:20.662
He started eating and he really enjoyed, so much he enjoyed,

00:49:20.685 --> 00:49:25.217
he said “My god, I have never eaten such
beautiful fruits.”

00:49:34.088 --> 00:49:41.731
Even Shri Krishna, whenever he used to go to the capital of Hastinapur,

00:49:42.178 --> 00:49:48.581
he would not live with the kings there, with Duryodana,

00:49:48.931 --> 00:49:53.941
but with Vidura, who was the son of a maidservant.

00:50:12.072 --> 00:50:15.548
Because Vidura was an enlightened man

00:50:17.072 --> 00:50:22.604
and he used to respect Vidura much more
than anybody else.

00:50:33.655 --> 00:50:44.250
But sometimes a mistake we commit that we
get too much attached to innocent children.

00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:52.906
Give them too much importance.

00:50:53.978 --> 00:50:56.478
Innocence is like a river flowing,

00:50:59.710 --> 00:51:05.070
but if you try to stagnate it then the children get spoiled.

00:51:09.530 --> 00:51:14.580
They must be respected, but one should not try to make

00:51:14.573 --> 00:51:20.105
them look like something very exceptional.

00:51:23.202 --> 00:51:25.272
They are all just the same,

00:51:26.616 --> 00:51:34.148
they have certain various facets, but I have seen, children are just the same.

00:51:39.022 --> 00:51:42.072
Firstly, they never get bored.

00:51:45.632 --> 00:51:48.775
If you are innocent you will never
be bored,

00:51:50.045 --> 00:51:53.123
you see beauty all the time,

00:51:55.435 --> 00:51:58.901
and even if you are alone you enjoy yourself.

00:52:01.051 --> 00:52:05.151
It is only the grownups get bored.

00:52:08.115 --> 00:52:16.628
Now supposing you are in the airport and its late, and the
plane is late. All the others, all the older

00:52:16.668 --> 00:52:20.600
people will be very upset.

00:52:28.268 --> 00:52:33.769
But children will start playing with something that is in the airport – anything,

00:52:34.169 --> 00:52:39.985
a railing is there, or a steps are there, they will go up and down, enjoy themselves.

00:52:47.181 --> 00:52:53.871
They don’t want to make a sort of a life miserable by just

00:52:53.991 --> 00:52:57.873
bringing everything to some meticulous definition.

00:53:07.744 --> 00:53:11.004
I have seen in the airport many a times people

00:53:11.084 --> 00:53:15.450
just feeling very bored and terrible and while
the children are running up and down and playing

00:53:15.474 --> 00:53:19.318
and enjoying and making friends with other
children whom they have never met.

00:53:29.685 --> 00:53:35.774
Only by innocence you can transcend your limited ideas.

00:53:42.918 --> 00:53:53.658
I have seen parents who are extremely racist. Their children take to other people in no time.

00:54:05.633 --> 00:54:13.779
An innocent person is like that. He
just can carry on with any type of person

00:54:13.799 --> 00:54:18.974
without even thinking what sort of a color
he has, what sort of face he has,

00:54:19.094 --> 00:54:22.854
or what sort of hair he has done.

00:54:33.490 --> 00:54:37.706
These things do not matter.

00:54:38.825 --> 00:54:41.025
These are superficial.

00:54:41.957 --> 00:54:46.468
But children do not bother about superficial things.

00:54:47.878 --> 00:54:52.688
They just want to see the heart of the person.

00:54:55.857 --> 00:55:03.223
If the person is loving, whatever may be the
race, religion, anything, children will jump.

00:55:11.768 --> 00:55:17.767
I’ve already told you that innocence dissolves the ego.

00:55:21.488 --> 00:55:25.198
Innocent person cannot be aggressive.

00:55:25.958 --> 00:55:30.748
And if the aggression is there that is also very loving aggression.

00:55:35.985 --> 00:55:44.499
Like a child would come and say that ” Why
don’t you give my clothes to this boy?”

00:55:51.479 --> 00:55:58.028
And if you say, “Oh God, I paid so much
money and you want to give it to this boy?”

00:56:03.452 --> 00:56:10.434
So he’ll say “Alright, next time again you buy for me, but let me give this to this boy” innocently.

00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:21.900
Innocent children do not have sense of possession.

00:56:25.950 --> 00:56:30.683
Also they do not hesitate to share their things if they are innocent.

00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:42.996
But if they are brought up in a way that they show that

00:56:43.007 --> 00:56:47.026
“This is yours and this should be kept as yours” all the time

00:56:47.027 --> 00:56:54.843
put into his head that this is yours, then they start becoming possessive of their things.

00:57:06.097 --> 00:57:09.569
The best thing to enjoy is to live with children.

00:57:19.889 --> 00:57:21.925
And to be like them.

00:57:23.995 --> 00:57:26.495
And to enjoy them.

00:57:27.495 --> 00:57:32.213
This is how our innocence gets nourishment.

00:57:35.803 --> 00:57:41.568
In Sahaja Yoga I have seen, people become really very innocent.

00:57:44.502 --> 00:57:50.947
Shri Ganesha who is on the backside of your head also, who is MahaGanesha

00:57:50.982 --> 00:57:54.617
here, starts acting on the eyes.

00:58:06.390 --> 00:58:10.479
The lust and greed from the eyes just drop out,

00:58:14.982 --> 00:58:19.237
because you become innocent in your attention.

00:58:21.569 --> 00:58:25.934
So you don’t have to take out your eyes as Christ has said.

00:58:30.681 --> 00:58:33.214
Nor you have to cut your hands.

00:58:35.704 --> 00:58:38.204
Because you really become moral.

00:58:40.786 --> 00:58:45.402
I don’t know how many of you know that all
of you have become saints.

00:58:50.253 --> 00:58:54.035
As Ganesha was created, you are also created as innocent saints.

00:59:04.303 --> 00:59:08.333
Try to respect your innocence.

00:59:11.253 --> 00:59:16.053
That will make you feel young and happy.

00:59:21.393 --> 00:59:28.291
Is a , in India, in Maharastra, we have eight swayambu Ganeshas.

00:59:36.647 --> 00:59:41.509
And I have seen the people of Maharastra are quite innocent.

00:59:45.874 --> 00:59:51.541
Somehow, its a very ancient country, and in that area specially

00:59:51.541 --> 00:59:57.341
Shri Ganesha is worshipped, so people have become very innocent.

01:00:04.724 --> 01:00:13.963
They have a Ganesha being established during certain time, now is the time, for ten days.

01:00:22.133 --> 01:00:30.000
Made out of clay and later on is put in the water, sea or river.

01:00:40.249 --> 01:00:45.715
But as this Coca cola culture has also come to India,

01:00:49.335 --> 01:00:56.985
in the presence of Shri Ganesha they were singing horrible
vulgar song and drinking in his presence.

01:01:04.031 --> 01:01:08.611
These were all public Ganeshas, you see.

01:01:09.911 --> 01:01:13.369
So I warned them in two lectures, that don’t do this,

01:01:13.419 --> 01:01:17.979
because if Shri Ganesha gets angry, you will get earthquakes.

01:01:25.809 --> 01:01:28.227
They would not believe me.

01:01:34.987 --> 01:01:41.565
So third year these people in a village, quite

01:01:41.575 --> 01:01:50.155
a big place, went to the Ganesha resurgion,
means where they put it Ganesha

01:01:50.165 --> 01:01:54.577
in the water, and they came back.

01:02:04.228 --> 01:02:08.048
And they were all drunk and they were dancing

01:02:11.052 --> 01:02:12.792
in the night.

01:02:14.219 --> 01:02:19.043
And suddenly this great earthquake
came in,

01:02:22.593 --> 01:02:25.901
and all of them were buried.

01:02:28.981 --> 01:02:32.024
Except for Sahaja Yogis,

01:02:33.332 --> 01:02:43.102
and the Sahaja Yoga Center which was there was not at all hit by the earthquake.

01:02:49.632 --> 01:02:57.881
And there was a big gap round
the Center,

01:03:01.388 --> 01:03:06.783
so the people ran toward the Center that they can be saved.

01:03:11.334 --> 01:03:14.834
But they all fell in that big gap and died.

01:03:19.664 --> 01:03:24.650
So on the other side, the innocence is very
powerful.

01:03:27.015 --> 01:03:35.314
Anybody who tries to molest or to

01:03:35.314 --> 01:03:41.713
try to destroy somebody’s innocence is ultimately very badly punished by Shri Ganesha.

01:03:53.735 --> 01:04:04.183
Those people who do not worship Ganesha in their heart can become right- sided or can become left-sided.

01:04:12.073 --> 01:04:16.133
If they become right-sided they get all kinds of diseases,

01:04:21.973 --> 01:04:24.183
which are more physical.

01:04:25.815 --> 01:04:34.374
And if they become left sided then they get diseases which are psycho-somatic.

01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:40.326
Which are incurable.

01:04:42.386 --> 01:04:44.916
We have had some horrible people

01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:57.180
in our country who preached that through mooladhara chakra , through sex, you can raise the kundalini.

01:05:05.666 --> 01:05:07.872
And they became tantrikas.

01:05:09.582 --> 01:05:15.422
People who were tantrikas did all kinds of horrible things

01:05:15.386 --> 01:05:21.045
in the temples they put erotics, insult to Shri Ganesha.

01:05:33.229 --> 01:05:36.445
They are all now being destroyed.

01:05:39.476 --> 01:05:43.690
So one should never try to challenge a person who is innocent,

01:05:43.715 --> 01:05:47.210
who has the blessings of Shri Ganesha.

01:05:54.438 --> 01:06:02.622
Only through enlightenment one can awaken Shri Ganesha within yourself.
