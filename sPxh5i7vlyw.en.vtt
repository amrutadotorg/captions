00:09:36.114 --> 00:09:42.914
So welcome to you all, Sahaja Yogis,

00:09:43.248 --> 00:09:49.373
to this great country of yoga.

00:09:54.248 --> 00:10:02.664
Today first of all we have to establish

00:10:04.331 --> 00:10:09.914
our desire within ourselves

00:10:09.997 --> 00:10:12.664
that we are seekers

00:10:12.747 --> 00:10:19.914
and that we have to achieve our full growth and maturity.

00:10:21.664 --> 00:10:26.914
Today's puja is for the whole universe.

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:32.497
The whole universe

00:10:32.664 --> 00:10:37.414
should be enlightened with your desires.

00:10:37.831 --> 00:10:41.747
Your desires should be so intense

00:10:41.831 --> 00:10:46.164
that they should emit out

00:10:46.248 --> 00:10:51.831
the pure vibrations of Mahakali Shakti,

00:10:51.914 --> 00:10:56.997
which is the pure desire

00:10:58.081 --> 00:11:01.414
of attaining the spirit.

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:04.081
That's the real desire.

00:11:04.164 --> 00:11:11.413
All the other desires are like mirage.

00:11:14.831 --> 00:11:23.413
You are the people who are chosen by God.

00:11:25.497 --> 00:11:33.497
Specially, first to express your desire,

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:37.414
and then to achieve it.

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:49.164
And by intense desire of purity

00:11:49.248 --> 00:11:53.914
you have to purify the whole world.

00:11:54.081 --> 00:11:56.164
Not only the seekers,

00:11:56.248 --> 00:12:00.497
but even those who are not seekers.

00:12:04.914 --> 00:12:13.248
You have to create an aura around this universe,

00:12:13.331 --> 00:12:21.248
of desire to achieve the ultimate,

00:12:21.331 --> 00:12:24.747
the spirit.

00:12:30.497 --> 00:12:36.831
Without desire this universe would not have been created.

00:12:39.414 --> 00:12:48.914
This Desire of God is the one that is the Holy Ghost,

00:12:49.081 --> 00:12:53.081
is this all-pervading power,

00:12:53.164 --> 00:12:58.164
is the Kundalini within you.

00:12:58.747 --> 00:13:02.414
Kundalini has only one desire,

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:05.997
is to be the spirit

00:13:06.164 --> 00:13:10.997
and anything else if you desire

00:13:11.164 --> 00:13:15.164
the Kundalini doesn't rise.

00:13:15.414 --> 00:13:18.664
Only when it knows

00:13:18.747 --> 00:13:25.331
that this desire is going to be fulfilled

00:13:27.664 --> 00:13:36.331
by somebody, who is facing the seeker,

00:13:37.414 --> 00:13:40.997
it is awakened.

00:13:41.914 --> 00:13:48.664
If you do not have the desire,

00:13:48.747 --> 00:13:51.664
no-one can force you.

00:13:51.747 --> 00:13:54.164
Sahaja Yogis should never try

00:13:54.331 --> 00:13:59.497
to force this desire on other people.

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:02.164
The first ordeal we face,

00:14:02.248 --> 00:14:05.747
as soon as you get your Realization,

00:14:05.831 --> 00:14:11.414
is that you just start thinking of your family.

00:14:12.497 --> 00:14:16.081
You start thinking: 'My mother has not got it,

00:14:16.164 --> 00:14:19.413
my father has not got it,

00:14:19.414 --> 00:14:22.081
my wife has not got it,

00:14:22.248 --> 00:14:26.413
my children have not got it.'

00:14:28.831 --> 00:14:35.331
You must know that these relations are worldly.

00:14:35.413 --> 00:14:37.580
Sanskrit is loukik.

00:14:37.664 --> 00:14:40.164
They are not aloukik,

00:14:40.248 --> 00:14:44.164
they are not beyond the worldly relationships.

00:14:44.331 --> 00:14:46.413
These are worldly relations,

00:14:46.497 --> 00:14:49.664
and these attachments are worldly.

00:14:49.747 --> 00:14:54.664
So if you play into that of course as you know,

00:14:54.747 --> 00:14:58.081
that Mahamaya Shakti allows you to play with that.

00:14:58.164 --> 00:15:01.331
You go ahead, as long as you like.

00:15:01.413 --> 00:15:04.914
People bring Me all their relations,

00:15:04.997 --> 00:15:07.164
parents, this and that

00:15:07.248 --> 00:15:09.664
and ultimately they discover

00:15:09.831 --> 00:15:14.997
that this was a very wrong thing they did.

00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:21.997
They lost so many precious moments,

00:15:22.081 --> 00:15:24.664
so many hours, so many years,

00:15:24.747 --> 00:15:27.580
wasting their energy on people

00:15:27.747 --> 00:15:32.747
who never deserved any attention of Mother.

00:15:33.081 --> 00:15:39.248
Sooner you realize the better that this desire

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:44.497
may be within you,

00:15:44.664 --> 00:15:50.248
and may not be in anyone of your so-called worldly relations.

00:15:50.413 --> 00:15:55.164
Makes no difference.

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.580
As Christ was told

00:15:57.664 --> 00:16:01.497
that His brothers and sisters are waiting outside,

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:07.997
He said: 'Who are My brothers and who are My sisters?'

00:16:09.997 --> 00:16:14.081
So one has to realize that those people who involve themselves

00:16:14.164 --> 00:16:17.497
into the problems of their family all the time,

00:16:17.664 --> 00:16:20.580
and attract My attention,

00:16:20.747 --> 00:16:24.414
you must know that I am just playing about.

00:16:24.497 --> 00:16:28.497
It is of no value to you.

00:16:28.664 --> 00:16:32.164
For your ascent it is important first of all

00:16:32.248 --> 00:16:34.497
to have no desires

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:39.664
to create desire in your kith and kin.

00:16:40.413 --> 00:16:44.664
This is the first principle of establishment

00:16:44.831 --> 00:16:48.831
of Mahakali Power.

00:16:51.497 --> 00:16:54.580
Specially in India

00:16:54.664 --> 00:16:58.248
where people are too much attached to their family,

00:16:58.331 --> 00:17:02.081
it's a very big problem.

00:17:02.331 --> 00:17:05.497
If you give Realization to one person,

00:17:05.831 --> 00:17:10.248
you are amazed to see that all relationship they have

00:17:10.331 --> 00:17:13.831
is with a big bunch of bhoots.

00:17:14.664 --> 00:17:20.081
And once you give Realization to one person you are in for trouble.

00:17:20.248 --> 00:17:24.331
Then all the bhoots walk in, slowly,

00:17:24.413 --> 00:17:27.997
torturing My life, wasting My energy,

00:17:28.081 --> 00:17:31.747
and absolutely disgusting.

00:17:32.331 --> 00:17:35.081
It should happen to you to understand

00:17:35.164 --> 00:17:38.248
that this is not auspicious.

00:17:38.331 --> 00:17:40.914
If you want to waste your time,

00:17:40.997 --> 00:17:44.831
I will allow you to waste your time.

00:17:45.081 --> 00:17:51.164
But if you want to have the ascent fast,

00:17:51.248 --> 00:17:53.413
first of all one must remember

00:17:53.497 --> 00:17:58.414
that these are relations which are absolutely worldly relations

00:17:58.497 --> 00:18:02.414
and this is not your pure desire.

00:18:02.914 --> 00:18:07.248
So try to separate your pure desire

00:18:07.331 --> 00:18:11.497
from your worldly desires.

00:18:12.331 --> 00:18:15.997
It does not by any means,

00:18:16.248 --> 00:18:20.831
suggest that you give up your family,

00:18:20.914 --> 00:18:25.413
you give up your mother or give up your sister - nothing.

00:18:25.414 --> 00:18:27.747
But you witness them

00:18:27.831 --> 00:18:33.914
and see, as you would see anybody else,

00:18:35.248 --> 00:18:39.413
and see for yourself, whether

00:18:39.497 --> 00:18:43.413
they are really desirous or not.

00:18:43.497 --> 00:18:45.164
If they are - well and good.

00:18:45.248 --> 00:18:48.831
They should not be disqualified because they are your relations.

00:18:48.914 --> 00:18:50.747
It works both ways.

00:18:50.831 --> 00:18:54.497
As they cannot be qualified because they are your relations,

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:59.831
they cannot be disqualified because they're your relations.

00:18:59.914 --> 00:19:08.081
So in Sahaja Yoga to make your desire a pure desire,

00:19:08.664 --> 00:19:15.413
you have to get out of so many things.

00:19:15.497 --> 00:19:19.997
But for people who are attached to their family,

00:19:20.248 --> 00:19:23.747
are bound by their family,

00:19:23.997 --> 00:19:25.914
they have to see to it

00:19:26.081 --> 00:19:29.914
that they do not force Sahaja Yoga on anyone of their relations,

00:19:29.997 --> 00:19:33.997
at least don't force them on Me.

00:20:41.956 --> 00:20:48.123
Now this desire within us,

00:20:48.956 --> 00:20:52.622
which is the Mahakali Power which is manifesting,

00:20:52.705 --> 00:20:56.081
comes to us in so many ways.

00:20:56.206 --> 00:20:58.622
As I told you first of all,

00:20:58.705 --> 00:21:01.164
it comes to us after Realization,

00:21:01.289 --> 00:21:03.539
because you are all Sahaja Yogis,

00:21:03.664 --> 00:21:09.123
to do something about our relations.

00:21:09.331 --> 00:21:12.580
Then the second desire that comes to us,

00:21:12.831 --> 00:21:17.705
that let us try to cure people,

00:21:17.789 --> 00:21:22.331
who are our relations.

00:21:23.123 --> 00:21:24.789
This is the second desire,

00:21:24.914 --> 00:21:26.331
you should face yourself and see,

00:21:26.414 --> 00:21:29.539
that this has happened to many of you.

00:21:29.622 --> 00:21:35.164
So, right from leprosy

00:21:35.413 --> 00:21:40.539
to any small thing like cold or sneezing,

00:21:40.622 --> 00:21:42.872
whatever they have,

00:21:43.123 --> 00:21:48.831
you think you should bring to Mother.

00:21:50.622 --> 00:21:56.123
And all the worries of your families should be brought to Mother.

00:21:56.248 --> 00:22:00.664
Simple thing like pregnancy or sneezing,

00:22:00.872 --> 00:22:05.872
very simple things - which are so natural

00:22:06.164 --> 00:22:13.123
are brought into your attention.

00:22:14.289 --> 00:22:16.580
So when you have them in your attention I say:

00:22:16.705 --> 00:22:22.039
'All right, go ahead with it. Try to solve it, if possible.'

00:22:22.164 --> 00:22:24.789
But if you do not have them in your attention

00:22:24.914 --> 00:22:28.831
they are in My attention.

00:22:31.039 --> 00:22:35.747
You leave them in My attention, I'll manage that.

00:22:35.831 --> 00:22:39.872
But then it's a vicious circle.

00:22:40.539 --> 00:22:44.539
It's a very subtle projection of the mind

00:22:44.622 --> 00:22:46.414
that thinks: 'All right,

00:22:46.497 --> 00:22:48.622
that Mother we don't have this in our attention,

00:22:48.705 --> 00:22:54.455
You'd better look after it." That's not the way.

00:22:54.539 --> 00:22:59.455
You should have only one intense desire within yourself:

00:22:59.539 --> 00:23:03.248
"Have I become the spirit?

00:23:03.622 --> 00:23:07.455
Have I achieved my ultimate?

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:12.413
Have I risen above the worldly desires?"

00:23:12.455 --> 00:23:15.455
Purify it.

00:23:17.747 --> 00:23:21.289
Once you start purifying whatever falls off,

00:23:21.413 --> 00:23:24.539
I'll look after that.

00:23:24.622 --> 00:23:30.539
This is just an assurance, but not a guarantee.

00:23:32.123 --> 00:23:39.039
If it deserves My attention I will definitely look after you.

00:23:39.914 --> 00:23:48.248
You have to value your attention as I value My attention.

00:23:50.914 --> 00:23:56.664
I think you have to value much more of your attention

00:23:57.705 --> 00:24:02.413
than Me, because I can manage,

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:04.248
many more things within Myself,

00:24:04.373 --> 00:24:09.831
because everything is in My attention.

00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:15.789
But you try to purify your desires,

00:24:15.914 --> 00:24:20.914
away from the worldly problems that are facing you.

00:24:21.039 --> 00:24:24.914
So you expand it more, then you start thinking:

00:24:25.039 --> 00:24:32.206
'Mother, what about the problem of our country?'

00:24:35.622 --> 00:24:39.206
All right, give Me the map of your country - finished.

00:24:39.289 --> 00:24:42.872
That's more than sufficient.

00:24:46.413 --> 00:24:50.497
Then purify yourself.

00:24:50.622 --> 00:24:55.705
The desire that you have, you leave it.

00:24:55.831 --> 00:24:57.413
And once you are purified

00:24:57.497 --> 00:25:00.539
that area will be covered through your attention,

00:25:00.622 --> 00:25:04.539
it's very interesting.

00:25:04.622 --> 00:25:11.331
When you get over it then only you can throw light,

00:25:11.997 --> 00:25:14.622
but if you are inside you are hidden by that.

00:25:14.747 --> 00:25:18.289
Your light is hidden, there's no light emitted.

00:25:18.413 --> 00:25:21.164
You all rise above that desire.

00:25:21.289 --> 00:25:24.248
Every time you get a desire you rise above it,

00:25:24.373 --> 00:25:29.081
so your light is emitted on that wider problem

00:25:29.206 --> 00:25:30.956
that you are facing

00:25:31.081 --> 00:25:36.413
which you think should be solved by Me.

00:25:37.289 --> 00:25:42.373
These are all My headaches which you are taking on yourself.

00:25:42.414 --> 00:25:45.705
You have to do only one thing is to become the spirit

00:25:45.831 --> 00:25:48.373
that's all. Is a simple thing.

00:25:48.455 --> 00:25:52.914
The rest of it is My headache.

00:25:54.831 --> 00:26:01.289
Now the problems

00:26:01.373 --> 00:26:08.373
that should take your desire on the collective

00:26:08.455 --> 00:26:16.206
should be very different.

00:26:17.123 --> 00:26:22.081
To substantiate your purity,

00:26:22.331 --> 00:26:27.331
to be fragrant with your purity,

00:26:27.414 --> 00:26:30.705
your attention should be on the other side.

00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:32.497
Now you are not facing Me,

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:34.747
you are sitting with Me facing the whole world.

00:26:34.831 --> 00:26:40.164
See, the whole attitude will change.

00:26:40.248 --> 00:26:45.539
The attitude should be: 'What can I give?

00:26:45.664 --> 00:26:48.997
How can I give?

00:26:49.123 --> 00:26:52.413
What is my mistake in giving?

00:26:52.497 --> 00:26:55.039
I have to be more alert.

00:26:55.123 --> 00:26:59.455
Where is my attention?

00:26:59.705 --> 00:27:01.956
I have to be more alert towards myself

00:27:02.039 --> 00:27:06.331
what am I doing?

00:27:06.831 --> 00:27:11.455
What's my responsibility?'

00:27:13.455 --> 00:27:19.414
You must desire that you should be pure.

00:27:19.497 --> 00:27:22.664
You should be pure desire.

00:27:22.789 --> 00:27:26.497
That means you should be the spirit.

00:27:26.622 --> 00:27:31.539
That, "What is your responsibility to yourself?"

00:27:31.664 --> 00:27:37.789
You should desire that your responsibility to yourself

00:27:37.914 --> 00:27:41.622
should be manifested,

00:27:41.747 --> 00:27:46.206
should be complete.

00:27:46.289 --> 00:27:51.997
Then your responsibility to this Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:52.081 --> 00:27:55.997
What is your responsibility to Sahaja Yoga,

00:27:56.081 --> 00:27:58.539
which is the work of God,

00:27:58.664 --> 00:28:05.081
which has started and you are My hands.

00:28:06.831 --> 00:28:10.956
You have to do the work of God,

00:28:11.081 --> 00:28:15.414
and you have to fight the anti-God elements,

00:28:15.539 --> 00:28:17.914
the satanic elements.

00:28:18.123 --> 00:28:20.539
You are not responsible for your family any more,

00:28:20.664 --> 00:28:24.289
those who are, are half-baked Sahaja Yogis

00:28:24.413 --> 00:28:28.081
I said, are useless absolutely good for nothing.

00:28:28.206 --> 00:28:30.914
All such will drop out, their families will suffer,

00:28:30.997 --> 00:28:33.580
I know this is going to happen.

00:28:33.705 --> 00:28:36.081
Because now the forces are gathering in such a way

00:28:36.206 --> 00:28:39.831
that sorting out will start.

00:28:39.956 --> 00:28:45.331
Your responsibility to yourself, to be the spirit,

00:28:45.414 --> 00:28:51.539
your responsibility to Sahaja Yoga,

00:28:52.413 --> 00:28:56.705
your responsibility to understand Me,

00:28:56.831 --> 00:29:01.373
better and better and better.

00:29:01.414 --> 00:29:04.455
Your responsibility to understand this mechanism

00:29:04.539 --> 00:29:07.539
that is within you,

00:29:07.664 --> 00:29:11.747
your responsibility to understand how this mechanism

00:29:11.872 --> 00:29:16.414
works out everything.

00:29:16.664 --> 00:29:22.413
The responsibility is to how to become a guru yourself.

00:29:23.331 --> 00:29:28.872
Your responsibility to be a dignified and a glorified personality.

00:29:28.997 --> 00:29:31.664
A responsibility to be a respectable person

00:29:31.789 --> 00:29:36.539
and not a cheap personality.

00:29:37.081 --> 00:29:39.664
Every one of you

00:29:39.747 --> 00:29:46.956
is worth the whole universe.

00:29:48.373 --> 00:29:53.164
If you want to rise to that height.

00:29:54.539 --> 00:30:00.831
Universes of universes can be thrown away at your feet.

00:30:01.373 --> 00:30:03.914
If you want to rise to that height,

00:30:03.997 --> 00:30:10.039
to that magnitude that is within you to prosper.

00:30:12.123 --> 00:30:14.622
But those people,

00:30:14.747 --> 00:30:24.664
who still want to live on a very low level cannot rise.

00:30:26.664 --> 00:30:29.039
For example,

00:30:29.123 --> 00:30:33.831
the western Sahaja Yogis have certain problems

00:30:35.747 --> 00:30:42.206
of committing the sin against the Mother,

00:30:42.331 --> 00:30:45.373
and the eastern Sahaja Yogis have the problem

00:30:45.455 --> 00:30:50.164
of committing sin against the Father.

00:30:51.248 --> 00:30:57.164
It's not difficult at all

00:30:58.539 --> 00:31:03.455
for you to get out of it.

00:31:10.206 --> 00:31:18.289
The attention is to be kept pure.

00:31:18.497 --> 00:31:23.331
In Sahaja Yoga you know all the methods

00:31:23.414 --> 00:31:28.705
how the attention one can keep it pure.

00:31:28.914 --> 00:31:30.956
If the attention is not pure

00:31:31.081 --> 00:31:34.164
then this desire

00:31:34.289 --> 00:31:38.956
will be always attacked

00:31:39.081 --> 00:31:41.997
by all petty nonsensical things

00:31:42.123 --> 00:31:46.081
which has no meaning in your ascent.

00:31:46.164 --> 00:31:49.123
Now a person who is a good Sahaja Yogi

00:31:49.248 --> 00:31:51.831
is not bothered about clothes, what others say to him

00:31:51.956 --> 00:31:54.081
or what others are talking to him,

00:31:54.164 --> 00:31:55.997
how they are behaving towards him and

00:31:56.123 --> 00:31:59.872
the attention is not on that

00:31:59.997 --> 00:32:05.039
criticism that this person is like this, that person is like that.

00:32:05.123 --> 00:32:10.914
Nor there is the aggressiveness

00:32:13.123 --> 00:32:17.081
of anyone else,

00:32:17.164 --> 00:32:20.123
because nobody is the other.

00:32:20.248 --> 00:32:24.997
But the problem is when I say that,

00:32:25.248 --> 00:32:31.039
no-one thinks that I'm saying about you, each persons.

00:32:31.164 --> 00:32:35.539
Those who are aggressive take the other role

00:32:35.664 --> 00:32:42.164
and those who are non-aggressive think the other way.

00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:46.497
Like I say something for a person who is aggressive,

00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:49.956
the non-aggressive immediately thinks of the person who is aggressive,

00:32:50.039 --> 00:32:53.539
not about himself.

00:32:53.622 --> 00:32:56.747
You immediately start shifting your mind to other person,

00:32:56.831 --> 00:33:01.413
finding faults with other people.

00:33:03.831 --> 00:33:07.705
So this desire becomes

00:33:07.831 --> 00:33:13.539
gradually lower and lower and lower

00:33:13.664 --> 00:33:18.705
because of the loads that are put onto it.

00:33:18.831 --> 00:33:22.206
So the alertness is very important,

00:33:22.331 --> 00:33:27.331
complete alertness - satarkata,

00:33:27.413 --> 00:33:32.455
that we should keep our attention

00:33:32.539 --> 00:33:40.373
purely for the sustenance of our pure desire.

00:33:42.081 --> 00:33:46.414
Desire comes from your heart

00:33:46.539 --> 00:33:48.289
and you are so built

00:33:48.373 --> 00:33:52.872
that your brahmarandra is also the heart.

00:33:52.997 --> 00:33:55.956
If you don't have a clean heart,

00:33:56.039 --> 00:34:00.414
this won't keep clean.

00:34:00.497 --> 00:34:03.206
There are people

00:34:03.331 --> 00:34:06.039
who think if they talk about Sahaja Yoga big,

00:34:06.123 --> 00:34:09.206
and all that, they are all right.

00:34:09.289 --> 00:34:12.747
They are cheating themselves.

00:34:12.997 --> 00:34:16.747
If the heart is not open

00:34:16.872 --> 00:34:20.413
then this is closed.

00:34:20.455 --> 00:34:26.705
So try to open your heart by projecting.

00:34:31.664 --> 00:34:35.831
Projecting it.

00:34:35.914 --> 00:34:39.956
I hope today when you do this puja

00:34:40.081 --> 00:34:44.123
and you do the worship of Mahakali

00:34:44.248 --> 00:34:49.164
and this special yagya,

00:34:49.289 --> 00:34:53.956
we will definitely establish this aura,

00:34:54.081 --> 00:34:58.831
and enlighten the universe.

00:34:58.914 --> 00:35:00.747
But your outlook should be:

00:35:00.872 --> 00:35:05.872
'How much I have contributed to this.

00:35:06.789 --> 00:35:10.123
Am I still thinking of other people,

00:35:10.248 --> 00:35:15.331
am I still thinking of my petty small problems,

00:35:15.413 --> 00:35:21.664
or I'm thinking of my spirit?'

00:35:23.373 --> 00:35:28.705
So, the left side

00:35:28.914 --> 00:35:36.039
starts and ends with Shri Ganesh.

00:35:36.123 --> 00:35:42.455
Shri Ganesh has only basic one quality,

00:35:42.539 --> 00:35:45.414
that He's completely surrendered to His Mother,

00:35:45.497 --> 00:35:49.206
He does not know any other God,

00:35:49.331 --> 00:35:52.956
He does not even know His Father.

00:35:53.497 --> 00:35:55.664
He only knows His Mother

00:35:55.789 --> 00:36:02.248
and completely surrendered to Her.

00:36:05.789 --> 00:36:11.914
But this pure desire has to have the action,

00:36:12.539 --> 00:36:14.622
and about which I'll tell you later

00:36:14.705 --> 00:36:19.289
as we will be having more pujas and more pujas.

00:36:19.373 --> 00:36:25.206
But today let us establish ourselves

00:36:26.248 --> 00:36:33.289
into that pure desire, to be the spirit.

00:36:33.664 --> 00:36:41.455
Now, as it is, with the western mind we'll say: 'How?'

00:36:43.831 --> 00:36:48.956
Is always coming, "How to do it?"

00:36:49.039 --> 00:36:55.705
Should I tell you? It's very simple.

00:36:55.831 --> 00:37:00.705
Adi Shankaracharya wrote 'Viveka Chudamani'

00:37:00.831 --> 00:37:05.289
and so many other books of treaties,

00:37:05.373 --> 00:37:11.914
and then all these big intellectuals got after his life.

00:37:11.997 --> 00:37:14.289
And they said:

00:37:14.413 --> 00:37:17.497
'How this and how that and how?'

00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:20.081
He said: 'Forget these people.'

00:37:20.206 --> 00:37:24.872
Then he wrote 'Saundarya Lahari',

00:37:24.956 --> 00:37:27.081
it's just a description of his Mother

00:37:27.289 --> 00:37:29.622
and his devotion to Her

00:37:29.705 --> 00:37:39.123
and every couplet that He wrote is a mantra.

00:37:39.747 --> 00:37:41.497
It is not the surrender

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:47.497
of your mind through your mind,

00:37:47.622 --> 00:37:53.373
but the surrender of your heart.

00:37:56.413 --> 00:38:00.331
Is absolutely the surrender of your heart.

00:38:00.413 --> 00:38:04.373
Western Sahaja Yogis know very well

00:38:04.539 --> 00:38:07.914
how there have been attacks

00:38:07.997 --> 00:38:11.914
and attacks of negativity on them,

00:38:12.081 --> 00:38:18.580
specially when horrible people like Freud

00:38:19.123 --> 00:38:26.539
came to destroy their basic, the roots.

00:38:26.622 --> 00:38:31.914
And how the West accepted it blindfolded,

00:38:32.039 --> 00:38:37.081
and put them on the path of hell.

00:38:37.206 --> 00:38:40.914
All that has to be brought out.

00:38:41.039 --> 00:38:45.206
That is all nonsense, is wrong, absolutely

00:38:45.331 --> 00:38:50.164
against God, it's anti-God activity.

00:38:50.373 --> 00:38:53.705
Then you will realize

00:38:53.831 --> 00:39:02.206
that you will fight fully, by saying,

00:39:02.331 --> 00:39:08.997
"This is the destruction of our basics, our roots,

00:39:09.123 --> 00:39:10.539
when our Mother is the source

00:39:10.664 --> 00:39:15.414
of everything that is sublime, noble,

00:39:15.831 --> 00:39:18.789
all that is nourishing,

00:39:18.872 --> 00:39:24.414
all that is elevating, emancipating.

00:39:24.497 --> 00:39:28.039
You have cutting us from our roots.

00:39:28.123 --> 00:39:33.622
"When he dealt with, I think, animal-like creatures

00:39:33.705 --> 00:39:40.872
and he wants all of you to go down to that low level

00:39:40.997 --> 00:39:44.580
of human beings,

00:39:44.705 --> 00:39:52.747
which exist as pathological cases, I don't know.

00:39:52.872 --> 00:39:56.414
So it is important for you to understand all the attacks

00:39:56.539 --> 00:39:58.123
that came on you,

00:39:58.206 --> 00:39:59.705
and be alert

00:39:59.789 --> 00:40:05.413
and don't be identified with anyone of these.

00:40:05.455 --> 00:40:08.831
Last I would say you have come to this country

00:40:08.914 --> 00:40:13.373
to see the roots and not the shoot.

00:40:13.414 --> 00:40:16.789
Change your attitude of western style.

00:40:16.914 --> 00:40:19.289
Telephones are no good.

00:40:19.373 --> 00:40:21.789
You cannot get any telephones done here.

00:40:21.914 --> 00:40:25.039
Postage is horrible.

00:40:25.164 --> 00:40:27.164
Railways are worst.

00:40:27.289 --> 00:40:33.414
I shouldn't say because we are in a railway.

00:40:38.373 --> 00:40:45.539
But, the people are excellent.

00:40:45.664 --> 00:40:47.497
They know what is dharma.

00:40:47.622 --> 00:40:49.414
They are not being attacked, somehow or other

00:40:49.539 --> 00:40:51.413
because it being the Kundalini.

00:40:51.455 --> 00:40:57.081
The Ganesha is sitting here how dare anybody attack?

00:40:57.289 --> 00:41:01.539
This great Maharashtra has got eight Ganeshas,

00:41:01.664 --> 00:41:02.747
protecting them.

00:41:02.831 --> 00:41:06.831
I don't know if these Maharashtrians know this fact.

00:41:06.956 --> 00:41:09.289
And so many marutis,

00:41:09.413 --> 00:41:12.039
so who can attack this country?

00:41:12.164 --> 00:41:13.414
There is no negative attack

00:41:13.539 --> 00:41:18.831
except that they themselves are rather money-minded sort.

00:41:18.956 --> 00:41:21.997
That's the only curse they have, if they can get out of it

00:41:22.081 --> 00:41:25.914
they are great people.

00:41:28.956 --> 00:41:35.831
So, we have come to this country not to enjoy the comfort

00:41:35.914 --> 00:41:41.206
of the West, but the comfort of the spirit.

00:41:41.331 --> 00:41:46.747
So to change your attitude towards India

00:41:46.831 --> 00:41:52.164
I don't mean Air India, by any chance.

00:41:52.248 --> 00:41:55.039
This is a wrong idea that you come by Air India

00:41:55.123 --> 00:41:57.622
because you are a Sahaja Yogi. Not at all.

00:41:57.705 --> 00:42:00.705
Air India is nothing to do with Sahaja Yoga.

00:42:00.831 --> 00:42:03.206
All our railways, all our everything,

00:42:03.289 --> 00:42:05.248
they have nothing to do with Sahaja Yoga,

00:42:05.331 --> 00:42:07.664
so far.

00:42:10.123 --> 00:42:14.206
So you be patriotic and use your own airlines,

00:42:14.331 --> 00:42:17.789
for heaven's sake.

00:42:19.039 --> 00:42:21.539
But when you arrive here

00:42:21.622 --> 00:42:24.664
you will see that the people are too innocent,

00:42:24.789 --> 00:42:27.248
they can't understand Freud, you can't talk to them,

00:42:27.331 --> 00:42:29.956
it's beyond them.

00:42:30.081 --> 00:42:32.414
They are a higher type of people in this respect

00:42:32.539 --> 00:42:34.705
now because they are not attacked,

00:42:34.831 --> 00:42:37.497
while you are higher in a way that though you are attacked

00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:40.997
you've come out of it.

00:42:41.123 --> 00:42:44.539
You just turn your faces and you are on the other way.

00:42:44.664 --> 00:42:49.747
That's something great.

00:42:49.872 --> 00:42:52.497
So you would also have a confidence

00:42:52.622 --> 00:42:55.664
there are many people who believe the same way as you believe,

00:42:55.747 --> 00:43:01.206
in this big country where there's such a big population to support you.

00:43:01.331 --> 00:43:06.413
So you shouldn't feel lost.

00:43:07.497 --> 00:43:12.206
Thus today, we have to start this puja,

00:43:12.331 --> 00:43:16.123
on Mahakali Day.

00:43:16.206 --> 00:43:20.539
And it's the Day of the Gauri we can say,

00:43:20.664 --> 00:43:23.747
and Ganesh-Gauri's Day today,

00:43:23.872 --> 00:43:30.373
though according to the schedule time it may not be.

00:43:30.455 --> 00:43:32.289
But according to Me,

00:43:32.373 --> 00:43:36.872
let us establish within ourself on a subtler level

00:43:36.997 --> 00:43:42.747
the desire to be pure,

00:43:45.997 --> 00:43:50.123
and to be cleansed out.

00:43:50.206 --> 00:43:57.455
All the barriers and unclean things that are within us,

00:43:58.039 --> 00:44:02.705
to desire to be great Sahaja Yogis,

00:44:02.831 --> 00:44:09.414
desire to be responsible Sahaja Yogis

00:44:09.497 --> 00:44:14.413
and desire to be surrendered to your Mother.

00:44:14.664 --> 00:44:16.497
It's not difficult.

00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:19.622
That is the easiest, the last one is the easiest,

00:44:19.705 --> 00:44:21.705
because what you surrender,

00:44:21.831 --> 00:44:24.789
I don't want anything from you,

00:44:24.914 --> 00:44:29.956
except that you accept My Love.

00:44:30.081 --> 00:44:34.956
Surrendering just means you open your heart to accept My Love.

00:44:35.081 --> 00:44:37.914
Give up this ego.

00:44:38.039 --> 00:44:41.248
That's all and it will work out.

00:44:41.331 --> 00:44:45.539
I'm sure it's going to work out.

00:44:45.664 --> 00:44:49.039
I am trying to push Myself into your hearts

00:44:49.164 --> 00:44:53.081
and I'll definitely settle down there.

01:09:50.164 --> 01:09:55.206
Mahakali has a special capacity to weep,

01:09:55.414 --> 01:09:57.455
because She is left-sided.

01:09:57.539 --> 01:09:59.956
When She's helpless and She cannot act,

01:10:00.081 --> 01:10:02.831
She weeps.

01:10:02.956 --> 01:10:05.123
This is the only manifestation

01:10:05.248 --> 01:10:08.331
of Mahakali is that She desires,

01:10:08.414 --> 01:10:11.831
and if She doesn't get Her desire enacted

01:10:11.914 --> 01:10:13.331
then She just weeps,

01:10:13.414 --> 01:10:16.539
that's the only thing She can do in helplessness, isn't it.

01:10:16.705 --> 01:10:20.956
And sometimes when She's full of Love

01:10:21.039 --> 01:10:24.081
as I've seen you today all of you coming down here

01:10:24.164 --> 01:10:27.206
and all these people sitting down here.

01:10:27.331 --> 01:10:30.289
When She cannot express Herself fully,

01:10:30.413 --> 01:10:32.455
with full heart,

01:10:32.664 --> 01:10:42.789
also She feels that joy pouring as tears.

01:10:43.206 --> 01:10:45.081
May God bless you for today's puja,

01:10:45.164 --> 01:10:48.789
I hope all of you will take it in such a way

01:10:48.914 --> 01:10:51.414
that the subtlest of subtle

01:10:51.539 --> 01:10:54.081
will be awakened within you, the sensitivity

01:10:54.206 --> 01:10:58.206
every way, and the Love,

01:10:58.414 --> 01:11:01.497
which culminates into joy.

01:11:01.580 --> 01:11:07.914
Love that flowers into the fragrance of joy

01:11:08.039 --> 01:11:13.206
will manifest in today's puja.

01:11:13.289 --> 01:11:16.123
May God bless you!
