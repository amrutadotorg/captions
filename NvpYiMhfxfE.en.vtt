1994-10-15 Public Program, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

00:07:44.657 --> 00:07:49.810
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:07:54.482 --> 00:08:01.496
At the very outset we have to know that truth is what it is.

00:08:07.015 --> 00:08:11.546
We cannot change it; we cannot transform it.

00:08:15.133 --> 00:08:17.308
Also, unfortunately,

00:08:17.508 --> 00:08:23.079
with this human awareness we cannot know it.

00:08:26.825 --> 00:08:31.630
Can they hear, all of them? Ask them can they hear, all of them.

00:08:39.826 --> 00:08:42.048
Yogini: He is saying that with the fan it is not helping,

00:08:42.248 --> 00:08:45.277
All right, then put it off.

00:08:45.478 --> 00:08:50.681
If you move the fan further away, it will be all right.

00:08:50.881 --> 00:08:57.305
If you move the fan further away, it will be all right.

00:09:00.813 --> 00:09:07.172
Better. It makes too much sound; fan was making too much sound.

00:09:13.701 --> 00:09:20.938
So now we have to know that our awareness

00:09:21.138 --> 00:09:27.845
is not sufficient enough to know the absolute Truth.

00:09:32.666 --> 00:09:37.403
Actually, we don't know the absolute Truth.

00:09:40.901 --> 00:09:44.451
That's why there is a problem.

00:09:46.887 --> 00:09:50.055
Somebody says this is good. Somebody says that is good.

00:09:50.255 --> 00:09:56.699
There is a quarrel, fight, arguments, and ultimately wars.

00:10:04.396 --> 00:10:08.513
That means we have to evolve more.

00:10:13.844 --> 00:10:16.948
Whatever I am going to tell you today,

00:10:17.148 --> 00:10:21.437
you should not accept it blindfolded,

00:10:25.495 --> 00:10:35.386
but accept it as a hypothesis.

00:10:37.042 --> 00:10:44.778
And if it is proved, then you have to accept it as honest people.

00:10:49.802 --> 00:10:53.801
Because it is for your benevolence,

00:10:54.001 --> 00:10:57.809
for the benevolence of your family, your country,

00:10:58.009 --> 00:11:02.157
and for the benevolence of the whole world.

00:11:11.959 --> 00:11:15.274
At the very outset, I would like to tell you

00:11:15.474 --> 00:11:22.641
that the truth is you are not this body, this mind,

00:11:22.841 --> 00:11:31.935
these emotions, intellect, conditionings, or your ego.

00:11:41.689 --> 00:11:46.185
But you are the pure Spirit.

00:11:49.075 --> 00:11:54.740
There is another truth is, you see all these beautiful flowers

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:58.565
and we take them for granted.

00:12:05.007 --> 00:12:08.671
Actually, it's a miracle.

00:12:10.155 --> 00:12:13.752
If you ask a doctor who runs your heart,

00:12:13.952 --> 00:12:18.248
so he will say, It is the autonomous nervous system.

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:28.249
But who is this auto?

00:12:28.449 --> 00:12:33.109
Also, if you take to science you will find they cannot answer

00:12:33.309 --> 00:12:38.748
all the questions because it has its own limitations.

00:12:45.254 --> 00:12:50.738
For example, science cannot tell you why are you on this earth,

00:12:54.257 --> 00:12:58.197
what is your identity.

00:12:58.397 --> 00:13:02.593
So we take to religions.

00:13:03.797 --> 00:13:06.824
But in the modern times, religions have become

00:13:07.024 --> 00:13:11.039
money oriented or power oriented.

00:13:16.479 --> 00:13:25.274
Also, it was great incarnations who came

00:13:25.474 --> 00:13:30.825
like Christ, Mohammed Saab, Moses.

00:13:31.026 --> 00:13:36.738
They were very great, pure incarnations

00:13:43.611 --> 00:13:46.849
and they did not know what sort of people they were facing.

00:13:47.049 --> 00:13:51.361
The way they were tortured and crucified.

00:13:58.481 --> 00:14:03.648
They preached to people who cannot follow their followings,

00:14:03.848 --> 00:14:08.180
they cannot follow their principles.

00:14:14.156 --> 00:14:18.170
For example, Christ has said in the fifth chapter  Mathews

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:24.057
that if your one eye commits a sin, you take out the eye.

00:14:31.115 --> 00:14:37.412
If your one hand does some sinful thing, you cut out the hand.

00:14:40.293 --> 00:14:45.051
If somebody slaps you on this face, turn the other face.

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:54.208
I haven't seen any Christian without eye and without hands.

00:14:57.583 --> 00:15:03.004
It's an impossible thing and very difficult.

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:10.434
It was easy for Christ to say that because He was so great.

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:21.659
Actually, you have to become a saint to follow His principles.

00:15:25.307 --> 00:15:29.872
Ordinary people cannot follow Him.

00:15:33.138 --> 00:15:36.133
Then I think Mohammed Saab thought that He was so strict

00:15:36.333 --> 00:15:44.206
with the men, so He made lots of laws for the women also.

00:15:48.888 --> 00:15:54.407
And so strict that any woman who looked at any man

00:15:54.607 --> 00:15:57.743
with any lust, she should be buried halfway

00:15:57.943 --> 00:16:02.056
and should be stoned.

00:16:08.635 --> 00:16:13.299
Imagine what would have happened to American women.

00:16:20.344 --> 00:16:22.863
So the principle of morality

00:16:23.063 --> 00:16:28.063
was really too much for normal human beings.

00:16:35.304 --> 00:16:39.208
Also, the Sharia which was brought in by Mohammed Saab

00:16:39.408 --> 00:16:44.088
was given by Moses for the Jews.

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:54.228
In the Bible in the Old Testament, in the Jeremiah,

00:16:54.428 --> 00:16:58.857
it is described clearly.

00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:05.715
But Jews thought it was too much, so they didnt bother.

00:17:08.293 --> 00:17:13.805
But Muslims think they can do it; I am sure they can't.

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:23.370
So, they believe they are Muslims, but they are not.

00:17:25.432 --> 00:17:30.034
Christians believe they are Christians, but they are not.

00:17:31.289 --> 00:17:35.477
First you have to become a saint.

00:17:36.336 --> 00:17:40.865
You have to become an enlightened personality

00:17:42.897 --> 00:17:48.061
so that automatically you become righteous, automatically.

00:17:51.211 --> 00:17:56.524
In Sahaja Yoga, we dont have any punishments.

00:17:58.852 --> 00:18:03.234
Here, we have to accept human beings as they are.

00:18:04.734 --> 00:18:14.443
There are no confessions, and no physical or mental punishments.

00:18:19.162 --> 00:18:23.910
At the most, we can ask them to get out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:27.097 --> 00:18:35.352
As this Power lies in the sacrum bone, it's your own.

00:18:39.922 --> 00:18:45.711
She is your Mother, your individual Mother.

00:18:48.305 --> 00:18:52.699
She knows all about you

00:18:52.899 --> 00:18:57.688
and She is very anxious to give you your second birth.

00:18:59.868 --> 00:19:02.098
It is in the real sense of the word

00:19:02.298 --> 00:19:06.720
[that] you have to have your second birth.

00:19:09.025 --> 00:19:14.925
It is not just a make-believe that you are twice born.

00:19:20.128 --> 00:19:22.652
It becomes like any other brand like you are a Christian

00:19:22.852 --> 00:19:27.977
or a Hindu or a Muslim or a twice born.

00:19:36.805 --> 00:19:41.711
But anybody can commit any sin.

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:47.550
Anybody can commit any sin.

00:19:52.593 --> 00:19:56.994
So one has to become innately righteous,

00:19:57.194 --> 00:20:01.553
innately moral.

00:20:06.193 --> 00:20:11.677
It's only possible when you become the Spirit.

00:20:15.941 --> 00:20:20.452
When this Kundalini rises, She passes through six centers

00:20:20.652 --> 00:20:24.501
which are responsible for our physical, mental,

00:20:24.701 --> 00:20:28.951
emotional, and spiritual being.

00:20:36.908 --> 00:20:39.044
Thus, our physical being improves,

00:20:39.244 --> 00:20:44.684
or sometimes absolutely in perfect condition.

00:20:48.731 --> 00:20:54.078
In India there are four doctors from Delhi university

00:20:54.278 --> 00:20:58.505
who have got their MD in Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:07.485
Many incurable diseases can be cured with Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:10.485 --> 00:21:18.555
For diagnosis or for treatment, you don't have to go to hospitals

00:21:21.835 --> 00:21:27.048
because you know self-knowledge.

00:21:27.249 --> 00:21:31.420
You get self-knowledge

00:21:33.632 --> 00:21:39.163
because you start feeling on your fingertips your own centers.

00:21:41.859 --> 00:21:48.789
You start feeling this all-pervading Power on your fingertips.

00:21:52.633 --> 00:21:56.311
So, this is the second truth that you have to know

00:21:56.511 --> 00:22:01.745
that there is an all-pervading Power of divine Love.

00:22:07.965 --> 00:22:11.281
In the Koran, Mohammed Saab has clearly said that

00:22:11.481 --> 00:22:14.053
when you will get your resurrection,

00:22:14.253 --> 00:22:19.943
your hands, your fingers will know about you

00:22:20.143 --> 00:22:24.839
and they will tell you about you.

00:22:34.662 --> 00:22:38.943
This is the time of your resurrection.

00:22:41.185 --> 00:22:48.956
I call it a blossom time, but in the Bible it is described as the last judgement.

00:22:54.289 --> 00:22:57.026
You have to choose; you are free to choose.

00:22:57.226 --> 00:22:59.628
If you want to go to hell, you can go.

00:22:59.828 --> 00:23:04.039
If you want to go to heaven, you can go.

00:23:13.225 --> 00:23:21.504
From the day you get your realization,

00:23:21.704 --> 00:23:27.409
you start the transformation within yourself.

00:23:33.135 --> 00:23:37.363
In the light of the Spirit, you become your own guide,

00:23:37.563 --> 00:23:41.563
your own master.

00:23:44.414 --> 00:23:48.844
You give up everything that is destructive.

00:23:51.945 --> 00:23:59.235
You give up everything that is not for your progress.

00:24:01.969 --> 00:24:06.109
All bad habits drop out automatically.

00:24:10.124 --> 00:24:18.474
And these bad habits just remove all the diseases,

00:24:18.674 --> 00:24:23.206
all the destructiveness from your body.

00:24:30.851 --> 00:24:34.980
Its like this: if I am holding a snake, and there is darkness

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:38.612
and I cant see, and I am obstinate,

00:24:38.812 --> 00:24:43.773
I am not going to believe if you tell me its a snake.

00:24:54.485 --> 00:25:01.673
And unless and until the snake bites, I won't give it up.

00:25:10.209 --> 00:25:13.251
But if there is little light, even little light,

00:25:13.451 --> 00:25:19.201
immediately I will throw away the snake on my own.

00:25:24.842 --> 00:25:30.545
That is why enlightenment is the most important thing.

00:25:33.602 --> 00:25:35.669
If you want to save the world,

00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:39.481
it is important that we should take to our enlightenment

00:25:39.681 --> 00:25:44.230
and give enlightenment to others.

00:25:48.574 --> 00:25:53.218
As a result of this, your attention becomes absolutely innocent,

00:25:53.418 --> 00:25:57.535
devoid of lust and greed.

00:26:05.562 --> 00:26:08.174
Innocence is an eternal thing,

00:26:08.374 --> 00:26:13.001
but we have covered it with some clouds.

00:26:17.602 --> 00:26:21.551
It is never destroyed,

00:26:21.751 --> 00:26:28.442
and it comes back as soon as you get your enlightenment.

00:26:33.755 --> 00:26:36.704
So your attention becomes not only innocent

00:26:36.904 --> 00:26:40.591
but very powerful and active.

00:26:44.928 --> 00:26:49.404
Wherever you put attention, it acts.

00:26:52.377 --> 00:26:57.220
Such a person emits joy and peace.

00:27:03.148 --> 00:27:07.304
Then you know the absolute Truth.

00:27:10.093 --> 00:27:14.558
That means everybody knows the same truth.

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:19.794
Supposing if you have ten children who are realized souls

00:27:19.994 --> 00:27:23.845
and tie their eyes, and ask them what is wrong with this person,

00:27:24.045 --> 00:27:28.092
they will all lift the same fingers.

00:27:38.825 --> 00:27:42.234
So in our awareness, a new dimension is created

00:27:42.434 --> 00:27:47.900
called as vibratory awareness.

00:27:55.904 --> 00:28:00.320
Many people don't believe in God. But if you want to know,

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:03.343
you just put your hands and ask, Is there God?

00:28:03.543 --> 00:28:09.088
And immediately you start getting tremendous cool breeze in your hands.

00:28:17.588 --> 00:28:22.552
And if you, say, want to find out was Christ the son of God,

00:28:22.752 --> 00:28:28.780
you just find out. And it is true because you get the cool breeze.

00:28:35.952 --> 00:28:42.285
But if there is falsehood, if there is a false master,

00:28:42.485 --> 00:28:45.164
you can immediately make it out because you get heat,

00:28:45.365 --> 00:28:49.486
sometimes pins and needles.

00:28:58.478 --> 00:29:02.517
Everybody knows the same.

00:29:08.423 --> 00:29:13.825
Then the greatest thing that happens to you

00:29:14.025 --> 00:29:18.938
[is] that you become collectively conscious.

00:29:24.899 --> 00:29:29.397
Because you can feel the vibrations of another person,

00:29:29.597 --> 00:29:35.737
and you can feel the chakras, the centers of another person also.

00:29:39.365 --> 00:29:43.397
Then who is the other?

00:29:44.376 --> 00:29:49.057
Like a microcosm becomes the macrocosm.

00:29:49.258 --> 00:29:54.789
Microcosm becomes a macrocosm.

00:29:55.094 --> 00:29:59.688
Like a drop becomes the ocean.

00:29:59.888 --> 00:30:10.613
And such love, pure love and compassion flows in them.

00:30:16.535 --> 00:30:22.064
Then you understand the value of another person also,

00:30:25.143 --> 00:30:29.756
and also your own value.

00:30:29.956 --> 00:30:35.217
But you become humble.

00:30:35.417 --> 00:30:41.714
You can give realization to others. You can cure others.

00:30:46.175 --> 00:30:52.136
That is how one enlightened light can enlighten other lights.

00:30:54.511 --> 00:30:57.584
It's a natural process.

00:30:57.784 --> 00:31:00.405
Just like a seed. If you put it in the Mother Earth,

00:31:00.605 --> 00:31:04.573
it sprouts by itself.

00:31:07.648 --> 00:31:10.558
Because in the seed it is built in to sprout

00:31:10.758 --> 00:31:16.211
and it is in the Mother Earth the power is there to sprout.

00:31:23.324 --> 00:31:27.511
This is how everything is built in within you.

00:31:29.909 --> 00:31:34.717
It is spontaneous, means Sahaj.

00:31:34.917 --> 00:31:39.875
Means it is born with you, this right to have this union, yoga,

00:31:40.075 --> 00:31:44.075
with this divine Power.

00:31:50.236 --> 00:31:53.638
When we think, we think about the past or the future.

00:31:53.838 --> 00:31:58.519
We cannot be in the present which is the reality.

00:31:59.237 --> 00:32:01.717
We think about the future and past,

00:32:01.917 --> 00:32:06.073
and we cannot be in reality, which is the present.

00:32:13.766 --> 00:32:18.624
Because the past is finished [and] the future doesn't exist.

00:32:24.085 --> 00:32:27.299
But when this Kundalini rises, She elongates these thoughts

00:32:27.499 --> 00:32:32.064
and establishes the silence in between them.

00:32:39.752 --> 00:32:45.143
That time you become absolutely thoughtlessly aware.

00:32:49.024 --> 00:32:53.485
You are aware but you are thoughtless.

00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:59.944
You want to think, you can think. You don't want to think,

00:33:00.144 --> 00:33:03.805
you need not think.

00:33:07.769 --> 00:33:11.801
But inspirations start coming.

00:33:15.863 --> 00:33:20.924
This state is the state of peace within yourself.

00:33:23.963 --> 00:33:26.526
You become a witness of the whole drama,

00:33:26.726 --> 00:33:31.609
and you become extremely peaceful within yourself.

00:33:35.906 --> 00:33:40.152
There is no stress, there is no strain.

00:33:44.144 --> 00:33:48.822
You become so free of all these things.

00:33:52.314 --> 00:33:56.657
Actually, you become your own master.

00:34:03.911 --> 00:34:09.331
Last of all, the greatest thing that happens to you

00:34:09.531 --> 00:34:14.898
[is] that you jump into the ocean of joy.

00:34:21.619 --> 00:34:29.355
When you are happy or unhappy, these are two sides of a coin.

00:34:34.495 --> 00:34:36.523
When your ego is pampered, you are happy;

00:34:36.723 --> 00:34:41.457
when it is punctured, you are unhappy.

00:34:47.861 --> 00:34:51.867
But joy is singular.

00:34:53.617 --> 00:35:00.469
And it's a state in which you transcend all these limitations

00:35:00.669 --> 00:35:04.770
of your conditionings.

00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:13.937
For example, we have huge gatherings in India

00:35:14.137 --> 00:35:18.292
of people who have become saints

00:35:18.492 --> 00:35:21.690
and it is surprising [that] I have never seen them quarreling,

00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:26.117
fighting, nothing of the kind.

00:35:35.371 --> 00:35:40.390
It's a state in which you realize your importance,

00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:44.809
your glory and the glory of others.

00:35:51.573 --> 00:35:55.639
Its all your own.

00:35:55.839 --> 00:35:59.922
It's all within you.

00:36:00.122 --> 00:36:06.538
This power, what we call Kundalini, is in the sacrum bone

00:36:06.738 --> 00:36:11.909
that means the Greeks knew it was a sacred bone.

00:36:19.632 --> 00:36:27.501
Now this power of yours is the power of pure desire.

00:36:30.634 --> 00:36:34.253
All other desires are not pure.

00:36:36.026 --> 00:36:39.873
Today we ask for a house, we get it. Then we try to get a car,

00:36:40.073 --> 00:36:42.629
then we want to have a helicopter, then an aeroplane

00:36:42.829 --> 00:36:47.133
I mean there is no end to it.

00:36:51.694 --> 00:36:53.642
It is not satiable.

00:36:53.842 --> 00:36:56.861
In general, they say, wants are not satiable.

00:36:57.061 --> 00:37:01.073
Economics says so.

00:37:05.409 --> 00:37:08.014
So whether you are aware or not aware,

00:37:08.214 --> 00:37:14.599
this power of pure desire in within you.

00:37:19.638 --> 00:37:23.905
And once you get connected with this all-pervading Power,

00:37:24.105 --> 00:37:28.386
all your problems get solved.

00:37:31.551 --> 00:37:34.577
Even economic

00:37:34.777 --> 00:37:37.937
[and] political.

00:37:38.137 --> 00:37:44.426
Because most of the world problems come from human beings.

00:37:47.168 --> 00:37:49.891
And all the human problems come from these chakras,

00:37:50.091 --> 00:37:54.163
from these centers.

00:37:54.991 --> 00:37:58.307
If these centers are somehow or other corrected,

00:37:58.507 --> 00:38:03.549
the whole world can be a beautiful place to live in.

00:38:09.635 --> 00:38:13.950
By talking about peace or having organizations of peace,

00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:18.017
you cannot have peace.

00:38:21.484 --> 00:38:24.113
I have known people who have got awards in peace

00:38:24.313 --> 00:38:29.414
and [are] absolutely very hot tempered, very.

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:37.240
They never even smile. They never even smile.

00:38:41.967 --> 00:38:47.600
And if you have to approach them, it is better to go through a barge pole.

00:38:50.209 --> 00:38:54.633
I dont know how they get peace awards.

00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:02.633
You have to have peace within.

00:39:05.149 --> 00:39:11.407
In this short lecture I dont think I can tell you everything about it.

00:39:17.085 --> 00:39:20.526
But like in this beautiful hall you have so many lights.

00:39:20.726 --> 00:39:24.759
Only you have to switch on, thats all.

00:39:30.134 --> 00:39:34.034
But if I go on telling you about the history of this electricity,

00:39:34.234 --> 00:39:39.250
how it came here, it is so boring.

00:39:43.853 --> 00:39:48.486
So why not get it, enlightenment?

00:39:51.824 --> 00:39:54.796
It is so easy.

00:39:54.996 --> 00:39:59.269
You cant pay for it, you must understand this.

00:40:01.851 --> 00:40:05.971
God doesn't understand money.

00:40:06.171 --> 00:40:10.600
He doesn't understand banking that's our headache.

00:40:14.577 --> 00:40:19.522
I don't know how people can sell God in the market.

00:40:25.343 --> 00:40:28.691
Its all right [that] you can pay for this hall, all right.

00:40:28.891 --> 00:40:32.516
But not for your Realization.

00:40:41.509 --> 00:40:47.429
It will hardly take 15 minutes for you to get your Realization.

00:40:50.124 --> 00:40:55.175
You are feeling warm, but after that you will feel very cool.

00:41:00.245 --> 00:41:04.284
But as I said, I cannot force on you.

00:41:06.405 --> 00:41:10.522
If you don't want, I cannot do it.

00:41:12.585 --> 00:41:17.391
So those who do not want to have, have to go out.

00:41:20.688 --> 00:41:25.755
It is not mental; it is beyond the mind.

00:41:28.028 --> 00:41:31.117
So even My lecture is just an introduction,

00:41:31.317 --> 00:41:35.642
but it is not the happening.

00:41:40.939 --> 00:41:45.291
Happening is the actualization,

00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:51.627
I would say the actualization of your baptism.

00:41:53.681 --> 00:41:57.920
It's the experience, it is not just talking.

00:41:58.662 --> 00:42:03.314
And you all can have this experience,

00:42:03.514 --> 00:42:07.836
not at all difficult.

00:42:08.036 --> 00:42:15.591
You dont have to think about it, just it will work automatically.

00:42:19.084 --> 00:42:24.427
There is no problem of any kind that you will face.

00:42:28.265 --> 00:42:34.374
I feel Brazil can do very well in Sahaja Yoga

00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:43.652
because people are faithful and simple-hearted.

00:42:47.766 --> 00:42:53.602
As in Russia I found they have no conditioning of any kind.

00:42:56.507 --> 00:43:04.695
At least 65 to 70% people are very sensitive to spirituality.

00:43:08.588 --> 00:43:12.479
The rest are stupid I must say.

00:43:13.196 --> 00:43:17.029
They are taking to American culture of Coca-Cola and all that.

00:43:17.229 --> 00:43:21.939
They want Marlboro cigarettes.

00:43:30.329 --> 00:43:32.727
In Russia, in one place called Togliatti,

00:43:32.927 --> 00:43:38.216
we have got about 21.000 Sahaja Yogis.

00:43:43.255 --> 00:43:48.324
And also the government is very good there, I mean the universities.

00:43:48.524 --> 00:43:54.618
They have thrown away all other false gurus from there, everyone.

00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:02.127
Surprisingly, they awarded Me

00:44:02.328 --> 00:44:05.623
the award of the St. Petersburg university,

00:44:05.823 --> 00:44:10.058
which was the oldest university,

00:44:16.549 --> 00:44:20.599
as the honorary academician which were only ten so far.

00:44:20.799 --> 00:44:24.408
I am the tenth.

00:44:27.001 --> 00:44:30.516
And one of them is Einstein.

00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:34.579
One of them is Enstein.

00:44:39.344 --> 00:44:42.034
I was quite surprised, you know. So I said,

00:44:42.235 --> 00:44:47.259
Why do you include Me with Einstein? He was such a great scientist.

00:44:51.866 --> 00:44:54.565
So they said that, Mother, what Einstein has done

00:44:54.765 --> 00:44:57.299
is only on the matter. You are working on human beings.

00:44:57.499 --> 00:45:02.137
So they have given Me such a high award.

00:45:07.856 --> 00:45:11.990
I said, I am not doing anything. Actually, they have their own powers,

00:45:12.190 --> 00:45:15.011
and they are getting awakened to it. What am I doing about it?

00:45:15.211 --> 00:45:17.940
I don't know.

00:45:22.773 --> 00:45:28.551
But they are very sensitive people. There were 2000 scientists

00:45:34.048 --> 00:45:37.649
in that conference.

00:45:38.329 --> 00:45:40.817
They dont have much conditionings.

00:45:41.017 --> 00:45:45.110
I think they are people who are like clean slate.

00:45:45.311 --> 00:45:48.229
- Like? - Like clean slate,

00:45:48.429 --> 00:45:52.654
Clean slate, on which we write, clean slate.

00:46:00.792 --> 00:46:05.112
And it has worked really wonders there.

00:46:09.807 --> 00:46:13.065
So, I would request those who do not want to have

00:46:13.265 --> 00:46:15.362
their Self Realization should leave the hall

00:46:15.562 --> 00:46:20.054
because it is not proper to disturb in-between.

00:46:28.497 --> 00:46:31.369
But after Realization,

00:46:31.569 --> 00:46:43.820
one should not sort of get dissolved into that and do not grow.

00:46:51.129 --> 00:46:58.520
Because it is in the beginning you will feel really on top of the world.

00:47:01.789 --> 00:47:04.789
But you have to grow.

00:47:06.235 --> 00:47:11.286
You have to grow in the collective.

00:47:11.486 --> 00:47:16.916
You cannot grow in your houses or your homes, or in your rooms.

00:47:20.213 --> 00:47:24.256
But you don't have to give up anything.

00:47:25.913 --> 00:47:30.858
You don't have to go to Himalayas and stand on your heads

00:47:33.155 --> 00:47:37.538
or go to Gobi Desert to get nirvana.

00:47:40.593 --> 00:47:44.984
Here, on your seats, you will get your Realization.

00:47:48.609 --> 00:47:53.833
Don't have to give up your family, don't have to give up anything.

00:47:56.966 --> 00:48:01.138
You don't have to change your dress or anything.

00:48:02.892 --> 00:48:09.423
In Chicago I met a gentleman, the head of the Hare Rama.

00:48:13.849 --> 00:48:19.279
He was wearing a dhoti, what we wear in India, a dhoti.

00:48:23.395 --> 00:48:29.630
Specially that day it was very cold in Chicago.

00:48:32.794 --> 00:48:36.314
I said, Why do you wear a dhoti in this cold? Its terribly cold.

00:48:36.514 --> 00:48:40.576
As a mother, I feel concerned.

00:48:45.233 --> 00:48:49.639
He said, My guru has initiated me like this.

00:48:53.123 --> 00:48:55.712
I said, Do you think that by wearing this dhoti

00:48:55.912 --> 00:48:59.912
you will get your nirvana?

00:49:03.166 --> 00:49:07.030
80% people in India wear dhotis and go on saying,

00:49:07.230 --> 00:49:12.479
Hare Rama, hare Krishna. Are they all going to get nirvana?

00:49:21.184 --> 00:49:25.802
I mean if they all go to heaven, where will you be?

00:49:30.028 --> 00:49:35.012
It is the internal change that is needed, not outward.

00:49:38.879 --> 00:49:41.492
I think you all are intelligent people, and you will understand

00:49:41.692 --> 00:49:44.931
what I am saying.

00:49:49.235 --> 00:49:51.395
We don't have any organization.

00:49:51.595 --> 00:49:54.519
We don't have any priesthood. We have no hierarchies.

00:49:54.719 --> 00:49:58.397
Nothing of the kind. Everybody is equally the same.

00:50:03.804 --> 00:50:06.843
I have no secretary. I travel every day, practically.

00:50:07.043 --> 00:50:10.994
Tomorrow I am going to Sao Paulo and then I am going to other places.

00:50:11.194 --> 00:50:15.368
Everyday practically I am travelling.

00:50:20.916 --> 00:50:25.197
But I don't think I am travelling. I don't think.

00:50:27.251 --> 00:50:31.857
I will be 72 years of age [but] I dont feel tired.

00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:42.186
I am the same because I feel tremendous love for all of you.

00:50:45.846 --> 00:50:49.596
That compels Me to travel.

00:50:53.729 --> 00:50:58.345
And that love itself is so nourishing

00:51:01.314 --> 00:51:04.514
and so joy giving.

00:51:04.714 --> 00:51:08.776
Same thing you all can have.

00:51:09.675 --> 00:51:13.519
You all can have the same powers.

00:51:14.283 --> 00:51:19.119
These are your potential things which you must get.

00:51:32.422 --> 00:51:39.258
Now, this mother Kundalini, She knows everything about you.

00:51:39.458 --> 00:51:44.247
Like a tape recorder, She has taped everything. She knows you.

00:51:50.577 --> 00:51:53.315
She knows what mistakes you have committed,

00:51:53.515 --> 00:51:58.032
She knows what are your aspirations, She knows you.

00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:06.932
So please dont judge yourself.

00:52:09.518 --> 00:52:15.211
She knows and She is anxious to give you your second birth.

00:52:19.688 --> 00:52:21.988
So just understand

00:52:22.188 --> 00:52:29.690
that you should not feel at all in any way diffident.

00:52:35.547 --> 00:52:39.829
You must have complete respect for yourself.

00:52:42.930 --> 00:52:47.231
That means you should not feel guilty at all.

00:52:48.748 --> 00:52:51.420
This is the first condition that

00:52:51.621 --> 00:52:57.262
please don't feel guilty about anything that has happened in the past.

00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:07.845
Past is finished, we are in the present.

00:53:11.081 --> 00:53:14.694
So this is a very important condition because if you feel guilty,

00:53:14.894 --> 00:53:20.144
the center on the left-hand side is in jeopardy.

00:53:27.503 --> 00:53:36.260
So you may get Spondylitis, you may get Angina,

00:53:36.460 --> 00:53:40.272
you may get Tuberculosis

00:53:45.778 --> 00:53:50.004
or, could be, lethargic organs.

00:53:51.168 --> 00:53:53.440
So what is the use of feeling guilty

00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:58.078
and troubling yourself like this?

00:54:02.811 --> 00:54:09.548
The second condition is that you have to forgive everyone

00:54:09.748 --> 00:54:13.737
even without thinking about them.

00:54:17.714 --> 00:54:19.737
As this center is caught up,

00:54:19.938 --> 00:54:23.635
the Kundalini cannot rise above this center.

00:54:28.995 --> 00:54:35.311
Whether you forgive or you don't forgive, you don't do anything.

00:54:36.843 --> 00:54:39.624
It is a myth.

00:54:39.825 --> 00:54:42.329
Because if you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands

00:54:42.529 --> 00:54:46.490
and torture yourself.

00:54:50.998 --> 00:54:52.956
Specially at this moment.

00:54:53.157 --> 00:54:58.573
The center on the optic chiasma is like this, absolutely constricted.

00:55:05.536 --> 00:55:09.629
And if you don't forgive, it won't open out.

00:55:11.043 --> 00:55:13.483
And at this moment,

00:55:13.683 --> 00:55:16.858
you will miss the great opportunity of Self Realization

00:55:17.058 --> 00:55:21.901
because Kundalini won't be able to pass through that center.

00:55:26.710 --> 00:55:29.916
Also, don't think about people whom you have to forgive

00:55:30.116 --> 00:55:37.176
because it is a very painful, I think, sometimes.

00:55:37.376 --> 00:55:40.798
You get a headache.

00:55:48.164 --> 00:55:52.172
In general, you have to forgive.

00:55:53.264 --> 00:55:58.866
The third condition is very simple. You have to take out your shoes.

00:56:03.158 --> 00:56:06.139
In England, first time I said please take out your shoes,

00:56:06.339 --> 00:56:10.284
so half the people walked off.

00:56:49.610 --> 00:56:52.277
You have been already told about the subtle centers

00:56:52.477 --> 00:56:56.428
and the channels that we have within ourselves.

00:57:02.092 --> 00:57:07.653
So now we have two powers  left and right.

00:57:11.989 --> 00:57:14.296
The left one is the power of desire,

00:57:14.496 --> 00:57:18.160
the right one is the power of action.

00:57:22.456 --> 00:57:25.916
Is a mundane desire,

00:57:27.369 --> 00:57:30.877
everyday desire.

00:57:31.635 --> 00:57:38.614
Now, so those who are sitting on the chair,

00:57:38.814 --> 00:57:40.917
not those who are sitting on the ground they are all right,

00:57:41.117 --> 00:57:45.578
have to put both their feet apart from each other.

00:57:51.611 --> 00:57:57.127
And put the left hand on your left lap, that's all.

00:58:01.303 --> 00:58:05.318
And we have to nourish our centers with our right hand.

00:58:09.451 --> 00:58:14.548
Only for tonight we have to do, is not to be repeated.

00:58:21.110 --> 00:58:23.526
Now we will show you what is to be done,

00:58:23.726 --> 00:58:27.307
is to put the left hand like this, which symbolizes that

00:58:27.507 --> 00:58:31.492
you desire to have your Self Realization.

00:58:39.925 --> 00:58:44.457
All right. So please put the left hand like this.

00:58:47.996 --> 00:58:52.825
Now the right hand you have to put it first on your heart

00:58:56.164 --> 00:59:01.086
because in the heart resides the Spirit.

00:59:04.671 --> 00:59:09.268
If you become the Spirit, you become your own guide,

00:59:09.468 --> 00:59:13.022
your own master.

00:59:16.688 --> 00:59:18.966
So, we work only on the left-hand side.

00:59:19.166 --> 00:59:21.419
Put your right hand on the upper portion of your abdomen

00:59:21.619 --> 00:59:25.782
on the left-hand side.

00:59:30.430 --> 00:59:33.105
This is the center of your mastery

00:59:33.305 --> 00:59:37.567
created by great prophets and seers.

00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:46.696
Now you take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen

00:59:46.896 --> 00:59:50.646
on the left-hand side.

00:59:54.508 --> 01:00:00.532
This is the center, surprisingly, is of pure divine Knowledge.

01:00:05.071 --> 01:00:07.184
Now you take your right hand to the upper portion

01:00:07.384 --> 01:00:11.313
of your abdomen again.

01:00:14.452 --> 01:00:18.694
Then take it on your heart.

01:00:19.764 --> 01:00:24.388
And then in the corner of your neck and your shoulder

01:00:28.998 --> 01:00:33.513
and turn your head to your right.

01:00:34.104 --> 01:00:40.448
This center is not all right. Please don't feel guilty.

01:00:45.930 --> 01:00:52.309
Now, take your right hand on top of your forehead across like this

01:00:52.509 --> 01:00:56.283
and bend your head slowly.

01:01:03.181 --> 01:01:08.040
Now take back your right hand on the back side of your head

01:01:11.057 --> 01:01:14.814
and push back your head.

01:01:16.329 --> 01:01:19.614
Without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes,

01:01:19.814 --> 01:01:23.334
you have to ask for forgiveness from the divine Power.

01:01:33.699 --> 01:01:39.363
Now the last center is important. Stretch your palm as far as possible.

01:01:45.832 --> 01:01:50.092
Now put the center of your palm on top of the fontanelle bone area

01:01:50.292 --> 01:01:54.745
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:06.304
Now push back your fingers as far as possible.

01:02:07.941 --> 01:02:11.386
Now please put down your head.

01:02:12.628 --> 01:02:19.927
Here you have to move your scalp slowly seven times clockwise.

01:02:27.491 --> 01:02:32.999
Please push back your fingers otherwise there will be no pressure.

01:02:37.796 --> 01:02:41.710
And bend your heads please.

01:02:44.155 --> 01:02:47.864
Please move it seven times.

01:02:49.833 --> 01:02:53.770
That's all we have to do.

01:02:56.973 --> 01:03:01.250
Now we will start by closing our eyes.

01:03:01.450 --> 01:03:06.755
Please don't open your eyes until and unless I tell you.

01:03:13.341 --> 01:03:17.988
Please put your feet apart from each other

01:03:18.188 --> 01:03:22.532
and let hand on your left lap.

01:03:27.435 --> 01:03:32.185
And put your right hand on your heart.

01:03:34.279 --> 01:03:39.026
You can take out your spectacles and close your eyes.

01:03:42.034 --> 01:03:46.394
Please don't open till I tell you.

01:03:48.335 --> 01:03:52.807
Here resides the Spirit.

01:03:53.007 --> 01:03:55.314
So you have to ask a fundamental question

01:03:55.514 --> 01:03:59.685
about yourself three times to Me.

01:04:05.786 --> 01:04:11.728
You can call Me Mother or Shri Mataji, whatever you feel like.

01:04:15.064 --> 01:04:22.254
So please say it three times in your heart, "Mother", ask the question,

01:04:22.455 --> 01:04:27.089
Mother, am I the Spirit?

01:04:38.892 --> 01:04:41.997
I have told you already that if you become the Spirit,

01:04:42.197 --> 01:04:46.966
you become your own guide, your own master.

01:04:51.826 --> 01:04:54.782
So now please take your right hand in the upper portion

01:04:54.982 --> 01:05:01.277
of your abdomen on the left-hand side and press it with your fingers.

01:05:07.190 --> 01:05:10.529
Here you ask Me another question in your heart,

01:05:10.729 --> 01:05:15.158
very fundamental, about yourself.

01:05:21.346 --> 01:05:27.984
Please ask, Mother, am I my own master?

01:05:35.296 --> 01:05:39.643
I've already told you that I respect your freedom

01:05:39.843 --> 01:05:43.736
and I cannot force on you your Self Realization.

01:05:43.936 --> 01:05:51.091
In the same way, I cannot force pure divine Knowledge on you.

01:06:01.773 --> 01:06:05.480
So please take down your right hand in the lower portion

01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:10.048
of your abdomen on the left-hand side.

01:06:14.259 --> 01:06:27.833
Here you have to say again I mean you have to ask six times

01:06:28.033 --> 01:06:32.244
because the center has got six petals.

01:06:38.984 --> 01:06:41.963
So ask six times,

01:06:42.163 --> 01:06:47.882
Mother, please give me pure divine Knowledge.

01:06:54.858 --> 01:07:00.623
This is the knowledge about the science of divine Laws,

01:07:05.406 --> 01:07:10.624
which you get spontaneously, automatically on your nerves.

01:07:14.586 --> 01:07:19.535
As soon as you ask the question for divine Knowledge,

01:07:19.735 --> 01:07:24.149
the Kundalini starts rising upward.

01:07:28.398 --> 01:07:31.655
So you have to nourish the upper centers

01:07:31.856 --> 01:07:36.528
with your full self-confidence.

01:07:41.062 --> 01:07:43.377
So now raise your right hand in the upper portion

01:07:43.577 --> 01:07:48.780
of your abdomen on the left-hand side and press it hard.

01:07:55.762 --> 01:08:02.032
Here you have to say ten times with full confidence,

01:08:02.232 --> 01:08:07.505
Mother, I am my own master.

01:08:15.995 --> 01:08:22.452
I've already told you that you are not this body, this mind,

01:08:22.652 --> 01:08:28.312
this intellect, these emotions, these conditionings, this ego,

01:08:28.512 --> 01:08:32.837
but you are the pure Spirit.

01:08:42.341 --> 01:08:45.516
So now raise your right hand on top of your heart

01:08:45.716 --> 01:08:50.849
and here you have to say again with full self-confidence.

01:08:58.188 --> 01:09:06.253
Say it will full confidence, Mother, I am the pure Spirit.

01:09:06.453 --> 01:09:08.835
That you are, have faith in it and say it,

01:09:09.035 --> 01:09:13.534
Mother, I am the pure Spirit.

01:09:21.323 --> 01:09:28.279
This all-pervading Power of divine Love

01:09:28.479 --> 01:09:38.180
is the ocean of knowledge and bliss.

01:09:44.767 --> 01:09:50.868
It is the ocean of energy of compassion and love.

01:09:54.541 --> 01:10:01.898
But above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness

01:10:04.827 --> 01:10:08.596
and whatever mistakes you might have committed

01:10:08.796 --> 01:10:10.992
can be easily dissolved

01:10:11.193 --> 01:10:17.255
by the power of this ocean of compassion and forgiveness.

01:10:24.767 --> 01:10:28.870
You must have faith in yourself.

01:10:30.628 --> 01:10:35.621
So, forgive yourself and put your hand, right hand

01:10:35.821 --> 01:10:38.043
in the corner of your neck and your shoulder

01:10:38.243 --> 01:10:42.384
and turn your head to your right.

01:10:52.515 --> 01:10:58.450
Now, with full confidence you have to say sixteen times,

01:10:58.650 --> 01:11:04.667
Mother, I am not guilty at all. Have confidence.

01:11:14.097 --> 01:11:20.105
I have already told you that

01:11:20.305 --> 01:11:25.699
whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything.

01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:34.425
But if you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands

01:11:38.874 --> 01:11:42.728
and torture yourself.

01:11:42.928 --> 01:11:45.438
Specially at this moment if you don't forgive,

01:11:45.638 --> 01:11:48.099
the center of Agnya won't open and your Kundalini

01:11:48.299 --> 01:11:52.658
will not be able to penetrate.

01:11:59.373 --> 01:12:02.235
So now raise your hand to your forehead across

01:12:02.435 --> 01:12:08.114
and put down your head as far as possible.

01:12:16.887 --> 01:12:21.559
Here you have to say again with self-confidence,

01:12:21.759 --> 01:12:26.324
but not how many times from your heart,

01:12:31.949 --> 01:12:36.924
Mother, I forgive everyone in general.

01:12:45.104 --> 01:12:49.650
Now without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes,

01:12:49.850 --> 01:12:52.022
just for your satisfaction,

01:12:52.223 --> 01:12:58.939
you have to ask forgiveness from this all-pervading divine Power.

01:13:08.344 --> 01:13:15.488
So now please raise your right hand on the back side of your head

01:13:15.688 --> 01:13:19.730
and push back your head as far as possible.

01:13:28.855 --> 01:13:31.210
Here you have to say, again from your heart,

01:13:31.410 --> 01:13:35.621
not how many times,

01:13:39.273 --> 01:13:43.795
just for your justification,

01:13:45.484 --> 01:13:50.898
without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes,

01:13:53.929 --> 01:14:01.084
Oh Divine Power, if I have done any mistakes, please forgive them.

01:14:12.732 --> 01:14:15.915
Now the last center as I said is very important.

01:14:16.115 --> 01:14:22.560
You have to stretch your palm fully and

01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:29.520
put the center of your palm on top of the fontanelle bone area,

01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:34.462
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

01:14:49.504 --> 01:14:53.965
Now stretch back your fingers as far as possible

01:14:57.456 --> 01:15:01.589
and please put down your head as far as possible.

01:15:06.675 --> 01:15:09.802
With a pressure you have to move

01:15:10.002 --> 01:15:15.315
your scalp seven times clockwise slowly.

01:15:23.393 --> 01:15:26.732
Here again I cannot force Self Realization on you.

01:15:26.932 --> 01:15:32.592
So you have to ask for it saying seven times while moving your hand,

01:15:32.792 --> 01:15:37.378
Mother, please give me my Self Realization.

01:16:29.744 --> 01:16:34.869
Now please take down your hand.

01:16:36.554 --> 01:16:40.640
Slowly open your eyes.

01:16:41.140 --> 01:16:45.322
Put both the hands towards Me like this

01:16:47.678 --> 01:16:51.490
and watch Me without thinking.

01:16:57.331 --> 01:17:01.217
Now put the right hand towards Me like this

01:17:01.417 --> 01:17:05.147
and put down your head, and with the left hand

01:17:05.347 --> 01:17:10.514
try to see if there is a cool or hot breeze like vibrations

01:17:10.714 --> 01:17:15.238
coming out of your fontanelle bone area.

01:17:28.923 --> 01:17:34.102
Now, please put the left hand.

01:17:37.675 --> 01:17:41.862
Also, bend your head, it is important.

01:17:42.901 --> 01:17:45.108
Now again see with the right hand.

01:17:45.308 --> 01:17:49.272
Not on top of your head, away from your fontanelle bone.

01:17:49.472 --> 01:17:55.617
If there is a cool or a hot breeze like vibrations coming.

01:18:05.104 --> 01:18:11.666
Sometimes they are cool, sometimes they are hot.

01:18:15.697 --> 01:18:19.798
They could be close or away.

01:18:20.782 --> 01:18:24.234
But if you have not forgiven yourself or others,

01:18:24.434 --> 01:18:28.387
you get the hot breeze.

01:18:31.622 --> 01:18:38.032
So now again please try to forgive everyone, yourself also.

01:18:42.821 --> 01:18:48.072
Now please put again your right hand towards Me

01:18:48.272 --> 01:18:52.443
and see with the left hand.

01:18:55.533 --> 01:18:58.427
You have to move your hand because sometimes it is far,

01:18:58.627 --> 01:19:02.604
sometimes it is closer.

01:19:06.102 --> 01:19:08.707
It is coming out of your fontanelle bone area,

01:19:08.907 --> 01:19:13.352
so please have faith in yourself.

01:19:16.350 --> 01:19:21.366
Please bend your head, bend your head, otherwise.

01:19:28.399 --> 01:19:32.840
Now please put both your hands towards the sky like this,

01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:36.939
push back your head.

01:19:41.767 --> 01:19:47.811
Now, here you can ask one of these three questions three times,

01:19:48.011 --> 01:19:51.332
one of them.

01:19:57.161 --> 01:20:03.435
The first one is, Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?

01:20:07.808 --> 01:20:11.800
Ask three times.

01:20:12.612 --> 01:20:19.688
Second one is, Mother, is this the all-pervading Power of divine Love, Ruh?

01:20:25.183 --> 01:20:30.066
The third one is, Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya?

01:20:32.355 --> 01:20:36.425
Ask any one of these three times.

01:20:39.277 --> 01:20:45.790
This is the first time you are feeling the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

01:20:49.493 --> 01:20:53.939
Now please bring down your hands.

01:20:55.978 --> 01:21:01.048
All those who have felt

01:21:04.095 --> 01:21:11.089
cool breeze on the fingertips,

01:21:11.289 --> 01:21:14.197
or may be hot,

01:21:14.398 --> 01:21:18.882
same on the palms

01:21:21.108 --> 01:21:28.428
or out of their fontanelle bone area,

01:21:32.295 --> 01:21:36.123
please raise both your hands.

01:21:41.076 --> 01:21:43.361
What do you say to that?

01:21:43.561 --> 01:21:47.671
I bow to you all.

01:21:49.140 --> 01:21:56.968
Most of you have become saints now, so I bow to you.

01:22:04.137 --> 01:22:07.625
Please put down your hands.

01:22:07.825 --> 01:22:13.928
All those who have felt the cool breeze,

01:22:14.128 --> 01:22:20.760
this all-pervading Power of divine Love, have to grow into it.

01:22:27.721 --> 01:22:31.750
Some of you may not have felt.

01:22:34.344 --> 01:22:39.689
Maybe something physically, mentally wrong with you,

01:22:42.361 --> 01:22:46.294
maybe spiritually.

01:22:46.494 --> 01:22:50.650
Or maybe you are thinking too much.

01:22:52.650 --> 01:22:56.363
Or maybe you did not forgive,

01:22:56.564 --> 01:23:00.934
you do not forgive yourself and others.

01:23:01.134 --> 01:23:04.075
Whatever it is,

01:23:04.275 --> 01:23:08.064
everything can be corrected.

01:23:08.853 --> 01:23:14.436
Respect your Realization

01:23:17.866 --> 01:23:21.934
and grow into it.

01:23:22.134 --> 01:23:26.426
Most surprising thing is that when I come,

01:23:26.626 --> 01:23:32.259
so many of you come here and get your Realization.

01:23:38.806 --> 01:23:42.914
But I am a foreigner, I am an Indian

01:23:45.315 --> 01:23:49.088
and you trust Me so much.

01:23:51.318 --> 01:23:56.122
But we have here very beautiful Sahaja Yogis.

01:23:59.861 --> 01:24:08.908
They will not take any money and you can grow.

01:24:10.826 --> 01:24:14.709
They'll tell you all about it,

01:24:16.530 --> 01:24:20.450
complete knowledge.

01:24:21.067 --> 01:24:28.958
So when I go away, you should not just give up, you have to grow.

01:24:33.255 --> 01:24:37.258
Otherwise, it would be like the parable of Christ that

01:24:37.458 --> 01:24:43.261
some seeds fell on the barren land

01:24:43.461 --> 01:24:49.234
and some on the marshy land which just sprouted and were finished.

01:24:58.905 --> 01:25:02.671
It's a very great responsibility

01:25:04.073 --> 01:25:08.940
that you are born in this special time.

01:25:11.319 --> 01:25:15.475
Then you have got your Realization.

01:25:16.468 --> 01:25:19.486
And it's only you, the enlightened ones,

01:25:19.686 --> 01:25:23.134
who can save the world.

01:25:26.673 --> 01:25:31.598
Make the world beautiful for your children.

01:25:33.379 --> 01:25:38.840
So please understand your own worth and value.

01:25:42.450 --> 01:25:45.140
Now, please know your identity that

01:25:45.340 --> 01:25:50.020
you have entered into the kingdom of God.

01:25:54.779 --> 01:25:58.764
Life would be full of blessings.

01:26:00.357 --> 01:26:05.317
But please grow and give it to others.

01:26:09.552 --> 01:26:13.006
Have faith in yourself.

01:26:13.206 --> 01:26:18.659
My message is, now enjoy yourself and enjoy others.

01:26:22.169 --> 01:26:26.896
May God bless you all.

01:27:24.087 --> 01:27:28.962
Thank you very much. Thank you.
