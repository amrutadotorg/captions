00:01.253 --> 00:07.597
Today we are here to celebrate
the resurrection of Christ.

00:07.798 --> 00:14.698
Resurrection of Christ has the greatest
significance for all the Sahaj Yogis.

00:14.899 --> 00:19.801
And we have to understand that He
resurrected Himself

00:20.002 --> 00:23.343
so that we could resurrect ourselves.

00:23.544 --> 00:29.342
The message of His life is His resurrection
and not His cross.

00:29.543 --> 00:35.292
He bore the cross for us and we don’t have
to bear anymore.

00:35.493 --> 00:38.774
I see lots of people having this drama
going on:

00:38.975 --> 00:42.618
they are carrying the cross across

00:42.819 --> 00:46.384
to show as if we are going to do the job
for Christ!

00:46.585 --> 00:51.731
As if He has left some work to be done
by these people who play a drama.

00:51.932 --> 00:56.458
But all this drama is to deceive yourself
and to deceive others.

00:56.659 --> 01:05.920
There’s no sense in playing such useless
things to show how Christ suffered.

01:06.121 --> 01:10.356
To make you weep and to make you cry,
Christ did not suffer.

01:10.557 --> 01:14.557
He suffered that you should enjoy,
that you should be happy,

01:14.758 --> 01:20.594
that you should lead a life of complete
bliss and gratitude

01:20.795 --> 01:23.568
to the Almighty who has created you.

01:23.769 --> 01:26.452
He would never like you to be unhappy.

01:26.653 --> 01:31.153
Which father would like his son to be
unhappy?

01:31.354 --> 01:37.384
So we have to understand that His message
of His life,

01:37.585 --> 01:43.810
why He came on this Earth to do the
greatest job is that of resurrection.

01:44.011 --> 01:49.135
If He had not resurrected Himself, I could
not have worked out Sahaj Yoga.

01:49.336 --> 01:53.209
So we have to be eternally thankful
to His life and to Him,

01:53.410 --> 01:59.993
the way He did all these difficult tasks,
taking upon Himself.

02:00.194 --> 02:03.420
That, we cannot do, we human beings, cannot
do it.

02:03.621 --> 02:07.923
It’s only He being the Divine, He being
the Om,

02:08.124 --> 02:14.408
He being the Logos, He being the Brahma
could do it.

02:15.003 --> 02:18.093
But now you all have ascended.

02:18.294 --> 02:23.629
I can see on your faces: Christ writ large
on your faces.

02:23.830 --> 02:28.054
It’s beautifully shining in your eyes and
twinkling.

02:28.255 --> 02:33.576
He’s there within us, in our hearts,
in our eyes,

02:33.777 --> 02:39.092
and He has resurrected Himself and
He has resurrected you, too.

02:39.293 --> 02:43.244
But now it is for you to resurrect other
people.

02:43.445 --> 02:47.669
You can resurrect other people, this is
the power you have got it

02:47.974 --> 02:51.170
through Him, maybe, or through your
Kundalini.

02:51.371 --> 02:54.798
But you have this power to resurrect other
people,

02:54.999 --> 02:59.111
but first and foremost thing [is] you have
to be strong like Christ:

02:59.312 --> 03:06.321
how He obeyed His Mother and how He
obeyed all the demands of His life.

03:06.522 --> 03:13.208
How He was committed and how He dedicated
Himself to this single task.

03:13.409 --> 03:17.824
He didn’t bother as to develop His monetary
side

03:18.025 --> 03:20.634
or to become some sort of a big officer

03:20.834 --> 03:24.630
or to become another great rider,
or a swimmer,

03:24.831 --> 03:29.716
or climb on the Alps, some sort of a thing
like that.

03:31.224 --> 03:35.991
He didn’t try all these tricks, and didn’t
try to hanker after all these things

03:36.192 --> 03:41.484
that sometimes make us quite mad.

03:41.685 --> 03:53.726
What He did was to establish His identity
as the Brahma itself,

03:53.927 --> 03:58.643
as the Divine vibrations itself, which He
established.

03:58.844 --> 04:05.554
And what you have to do is to establish
yourself as the resurrected people,

04:05.755 --> 04:10.546
as the realised souls, as the Sahaj Yogis.

04:10.760 --> 04:13.794
And this is going to be very easy.

04:13.995 --> 04:18.497
Now everything is made easy for you:
your realisation,

04:18.698 --> 04:26.369
then your powers, everything has
beautifully settled within you.

04:26.570 --> 04:30.752
It has worked out so beautifully, slowly
and steadily.

04:30.975 --> 04:40.601
I don’t think I have ever tried to force
you to do something

04:40.802 --> 04:44.345
or have compelled you to do something.

04:44.551 --> 04:49.269
But through your own ascent you can see
what’s wrong with you

04:49.470 --> 04:53.542
or with the people about whom we are
talking.

04:53.743 --> 05:02.314
And then you can also know through all
these powers whatever is to be known.

05:02.515 --> 05:06.687
All that is unknown can be your own,
everything.

05:06.896 --> 05:11.683
But the attention should be towards your
ascent, towards the state.

05:11.884 --> 05:16.649
Now ascent is not some sort of a physical
process.

05:16.850 --> 05:20.010
It is not that you ascend some staircases.

05:20.211 --> 05:26.211
It is a state. It’s a state of your
personality.

05:26.412 --> 05:28.396
And there where I always say…

05:28.597 --> 05:33.944
Excuse me, I think I’ll... The sun is
showing its results.

05:34.145 --> 05:36.134
See how the sun listens to me!

05:36.335 --> 05:39.673
Can you help me, a little bit, to take out
things.

05:39.874 --> 05:44.699
Very hot for me, I don’t know what
about you people.

05:45.064 --> 05:48.620
He’s just telling me off (the Sun).

06:04.732 --> 06:08.031
I forgot to tell you about the Sun so he’s
just troubling me,

06:08.232 --> 06:11.269
so I better tell!

06:24.244 --> 06:31.306
They have been telling for the last one
year, you see,

06:31.507 --> 06:35.908
we’ve been thinking of coming here
for this puja.

06:36.109 --> 06:40.976
And I was very anxious that we should have
the Easter Puja here,

06:41.177 --> 06:44.328
but the dates were not very suitable,

06:44.529 --> 06:47.434
because those days the moon would be
waning.

06:47.635 --> 06:50.289
So I thought, “How will I do it without
the moon?

06:50.490 --> 06:53.594
We have to have the moon there.
It’s important.”

06:53.795 --> 06:57.637
So I thought, “We’ll have it sometimes
later.”

06:57.838 --> 07:02.643
And suddenly it happened that I had to come
here: luckily I was here.

07:02.844 --> 07:06.559
And then on the television for the last one
week, they have been telling

07:06.760 --> 07:12.626
that it’s going to rain heavily, it’s going
to be very clouded

07:12.827 --> 07:15.838
and the temperature is going to be very bad

07:16.039 --> 07:22.512
and it’s going to be very, very heavy
rains.

07:36.075 --> 07:39.330
And again and again, every night, every
time

07:39.531 --> 07:45.029
they announced about the weather it was
looking even worse, every time.

07:45.243 --> 07:50.430
So I thought, “Now what to do?”

07:53.501 --> 07:56.532
If you ask the clouds to move out

07:56.751 --> 08:02.960
you have to have a tremendous breeze
and that may spoil your tent.

08:03.161 --> 08:05.480
So somehow or other, you see,

08:05.681 --> 08:11.600
I just told the clouds that, “You’d better
move on to Newfoundland,

08:11.801 --> 08:18.256
slowly, steadily, not with great speed.”
And they did it.

08:20.307 --> 08:23.435
And then the Sun which was very bright came
out.

08:23.636 --> 08:27.609
Early in the morning I saw Him, red like my
sari.

08:27.823 --> 08:34.167
So beautiful it was. And you were all
asleep but I was awake, very early.

08:34.368 --> 08:40.055
And I was watching the way it came up: just
like my bindi it came up.

08:40.256 --> 08:43.586
I saw it, and I said, “Look at the sun!

08:43.787 --> 08:50.200
How obedient, how dedicated, how
beautiful!”

08:50.401 --> 08:53.633
Whatever it is: today is Mother’s Puja,

08:53.834 --> 08:58.932
you have to have proper light, you have
to have proper temperature.

08:59.133 --> 09:01.882
So look at the sky! Look at everything!

09:02.083 --> 09:05.900
And then gradually it became pink like your
faces.

09:06.101 --> 09:11.302
It’s beautiful! It became pink, beautifully
pink, and then now it’s shining.

09:11.503 --> 09:18.222
I’m sorry I should have given full tribute
to the Sun, the way He has acted.

09:18.423 --> 09:23.936
So that’s why He is troubling me a little
bit, you see, to remind me!

09:25.621 --> 09:37.283
So, as you know the Sun is the Agnya
chakra.

09:37.554 --> 09:42.647
Christ resides in the Sun.

09:42.893 --> 09:51.480
And in the body, in the being, He is
the Spirit.

09:51.681 --> 09:54.128
When He’s the Spirit, He’s the moon.

09:54.343 --> 09:58.746
And when He acts on the Agnya, He’s
the Sun.

09:58.947 --> 10:03.713
Now we have seen in His life

10:03.914 --> 10:09.673
that He was absolutely spotlessly
immaculate.

10:10.039 --> 10:17.959
He had no defects in Him. He was
a perfect personality.

10:18.459 --> 10:22.483
“Then why did He want to resurrect?”, one
can ask.

10:22.684 --> 10:27.010
What is in His time, is the resurrection.

10:27.211 --> 10:34.631
His resurrection is like making the way
through the Agnya chakra

10:34.832 --> 10:38.522
for all of you to pass through it.

10:38.723 --> 10:43.225
He was like the gate, or we should say
He was the One

10:43.426 --> 10:47.857
who opened the gate for all of
you.

10:48.058 --> 10:51.825
Because He was so perfect,

10:52.242 --> 10:56.848
He had no problems as we have of our
chakras, our Kundalini.

10:57.049 --> 11:05.636
He had no problems. But He was
the complete compassion

11:05.837 --> 11:14.339
in the nature of vibrations: the vibrations
became complete compassion.

11:14.540 --> 11:18.482
So much so that even when He was
resurrected

11:18.683 --> 11:23.259
and even before that when He was crucified

11:23.460 --> 11:31.086
He said that, “Oh, God, the Father, please
forgive those people

11:31.287 --> 11:34.059
because they do not know what they
are doing.‎”

11:34.289 --> 11:38.106
Such forgiveness, such compassion!

11:38.307 --> 11:41.995
And the Mother had to watch all that,
keeping quiet,

11:42.218 --> 11:47.381
because that was the game, that was
the thing one had to do.

11:47.582 --> 11:51.299
He had to play His game and He played it
so well.

11:51.500 --> 11:56.352
So now when we talk about Christ, we have
to remember one thing:

11:56.553 --> 12:02.555
that He has done all this for us, now what
are we going to do for Him?

12:02.756 --> 12:05.257
He is the pattern we have to follow.

12:05.458 --> 12:08.134
Supposing if that is the pattern we have to
follow,

12:08.335 --> 12:13.746
then it’s not that we carry the cross
on our shoulder.

12:13.947 --> 12:16.051
That’s not the pattern you have to follow.

12:16.252 --> 12:19.185
Many people think [that] because He carried
the cross, we can carry the cross.

12:19.386 --> 12:21.282
Anybody can carry the cross!

12:21.483 --> 12:29.454
In India, if you give about five rupees to
a loader, he can carry a cross across!

12:29.655 --> 12:31.435
What is so great about it?

12:31.673 --> 12:36.843
What is so great in carrying a cross
on your shoulder?

12:37.044 --> 12:41.888
It’s nothing something great. Any wrestler
can do it, anybody can do it.

12:42.096 --> 12:46.283
That’s not the point! The point is we have
to carry

12:46.484 --> 12:51.774
the work of Christ, of resurrection.
That is what we have to realise.

12:51.974 --> 12:57.719
We have to understand the importance
of our being, of our lives,

12:57.920 --> 13:03.057
like Christ understood that He has come
for this great job here.

13:03.258 --> 13:05.406
And though He came as a human being,

13:05.607 --> 13:10.120
though He came as an ordinary son
of an ordinary carpenter.

13:10.321 --> 13:15.713
Though on this Earth He had a body and He
lived like other human beings,

13:15.927 --> 13:19.785
still He knew what He had to do,

13:19.986 --> 13:23.394
He knew what He had to achieve and He
achieved it.

13:23.594 --> 13:26.582
I think His was the most difficult task,

13:26.804 --> 13:30.145
which He achieved and which He
furnished it, so well,

13:30.346 --> 13:33.838
that today we are having all the benefits
of that.

13:34.039 --> 13:38.568
Now let us see if we have done something
for Sahaj Yoga or not.

13:38.769 --> 13:42.554
We all should examine ourselves: what have
we done for Sahaj Yoga?

13:42.754 --> 13:45.443
Not carrying the cross, I mean to say.

13:45.644 --> 13:49.126
Some people think when they travel in India
and if they carry

13:49.327 --> 13:53.162
the luggage of people downward, they are
carrying the cross of Christ.

13:53.363 --> 13:54.680
That’s not the way!

13:54.881 --> 13:57.947
It’s something very, very serious one has
to think about.

13:58.154 --> 14:05.653
And that seriousness is: how far we have
achieved that state,

14:06.010 --> 14:08.035
for that what have we done?

14:08.236 --> 14:11.245
And a simple thing I have been asking
all of you:

14:11.446 --> 14:15.069
you have to meditate every day!

14:15.270 --> 14:18.666
All of you have to meditate everyday.

14:18.867 --> 14:23.909
But somehow nobody has time to meditate.

14:24.110 --> 14:29.927
We are having these watches just to know
that we have to meditate,

14:30.128 --> 14:33.445
not for anything else. Our lives are
for meditation.

14:33.646 --> 14:39.020
You need not spend all your twenty-four
hours, but you have to meditate!

14:39.221 --> 14:44.172
Everyday you must meditate. If you
meditate your children will meditate.

14:44.373 --> 14:49.327
And meditation is such a simple thing
for you, made so easy

14:49.528 --> 14:53.790
that all the elements you can see work
it out.

14:53.991 --> 14:57.001
All your chakras are made of different
elements

14:57.202 --> 15:00.703
and when you clear out with the different
style —

15:00.904 --> 15:04.486
I mean, you know all the methods and
the techniques of Sahaj Yoga —

15:04.687 --> 15:08.694
with that when you clear out the chakras,
when you clear them out

15:08.895 --> 15:17.270
you are absolutely free, absolutely at that
stage where you have to be.

15:17.471 --> 15:21.729
But if you do not do this much even —
is to meditate —

15:21.930 --> 15:26.515
it’s going to be very, very difficult
for me and for you

15:26.716 --> 15:30.582
to achieve, for which you have come
on this Earth.

15:30.783 --> 15:34.739
It’s a tremendous task that I have taken
over, I know that,

15:34.940 --> 15:38.745
but I know how to do it, and you also
know how to do it.

15:38.946 --> 15:45.091
But the trouble is you get entangled into
your different conditionings.

15:45.292 --> 15:49.115
Now, by now you must have realised,
all these so-called religions

15:49.316 --> 15:54.220
in anybody’s name: whether it is in the
name of Islam, in the name of Christianity,

15:54.421 --> 16:00.995
in the name of Hinduism, in the name
of Sikhism — all this is falsehood.

16:01.196 --> 16:05.241
It has no truth in it.

16:05.442 --> 16:09.291
They have all tried to use it for their
own purposes.

16:09.492 --> 16:15.177
There’s only one truth and that is:
all these great prophets

16:15.378 --> 16:19.967
and all these great incarnations came
on this Earth for your ascent

16:20.168 --> 16:26.141
and not for establishing those religions
who are just interested in money.

16:26.342 --> 16:29.130
In these religions also you will find
there are people

16:29.331 --> 16:32.339
who are either left-sided or right-sided.

16:32.540 --> 16:37.115
There are some religions which preach
you should be very, very strict:

16:37.330 --> 16:39.932
you should not do this, you should not
do that,

16:40.133 --> 16:42.495
you should not drink, you should not smoke.

16:42.696 --> 16:46.404
There are some who say you should not
marry, you should not look at women,

16:46.650 --> 16:49.995
you should not look at men — all kinds
of restrictions.

16:50.217 --> 16:54.728
Even in Hinduism you will be surprised,
there are so many restrictions.

16:54.929 --> 17:02.587
If you see the amount of superstitions
that exist

17:02.788 --> 17:07.023
and that are created by brahmins in India
you will be shocked.

17:07.223 --> 17:09.101
For everything there’s a superstition:

17:09.302 --> 17:12.412
if you walk with the left hand ahead,
that means this,

17:12.613 --> 17:15.453
if you walk with the right hand, then
that means this;

17:15.654 --> 17:19.031
if you sit like this, that means that.
Everything!

17:19.232 --> 17:23.571
They have made a human being into a machine
and there’s no spontaneity about it.

17:23.772 --> 17:27.066
All kinds of absurdities there are
in Islam, too.

17:27.267 --> 17:31.521
But when we find them in a free place
like England,

17:31.722 --> 17:35.572
where there’s complete left-sidedness,
where you can do what you like,

17:35.773 --> 17:38.639
still you are a Christian: if you drink,
it’s all right;

17:38.840 --> 17:43.322
if you have ten wives, it’s all right; you
have fifteen keeps, it’s all right.

17:43.523 --> 17:49.008
Anything you do is all right as long as you
go to church and pay money!

17:49.899 --> 17:54.373
So there’s nothing, especially for
the Protestants –

17:54.574 --> 17:59.333
that’s the religion I was born in, where
everything is allowed.

17:59.534 --> 18:03.240
Now when we come to this kind of a thing,
what is the Christian religion is,

18:03.455 --> 18:06.112
then, comes to, that, if you ask them
the road,

18:06.313 --> 18:11.277
they’ll tell you which way to go — that’s
Christianity. It’s coming to that end.

18:11.478 --> 18:16.078
Now, all these religions either are
indulging into the Right Side

18:16.279 --> 18:17.961
or onto the Left Side.

18:18.162 --> 18:22.922
Some people like the Left Side and some
people like the Right Side.

18:23.123 --> 18:26.353
I will tell you the story of a priest,
I went to see him in Russia.

18:26.554 --> 18:29.844
I think I have told it to some people
before.

18:30.045 --> 18:35.612
I went to Russia and the Russian people
asked me, “What would you like to see?”

18:35.813 --> 18:38.777
So I told them I would like to go and see
some churches.

18:38.978 --> 18:41.504
So they said, “All right, very good, we’ll
take you to a church.”

18:41.704 --> 18:46.873
So they took me to church and it was that
Greek Orthodox Church, you see,

18:47.074 --> 18:51.298
and a Black Order, which is supposed to be
the highest. I don’t know how they call it.

18:51.499 --> 18:57.049
So we went inside and the priest said,
“All right, today I’m sorry,

18:57.250 --> 19:02.264
we cannot offer you meat because our
fasting is there. But we’ll have lunch.”

19:02.464 --> 19:04.515
So we had a very sumptuous lunch and
all that.

19:04.716 --> 19:07.998
But the priest was only busy drinking,
because it was a fasting,

19:08.199 --> 19:10.569
so drinking is allowed, according to them.

19:10.770 --> 19:12.944
So he was drinking and drinking and
drinking.

19:13.144 --> 19:16.210
He drank so much that he forgot that
we were there!

19:16.411 --> 19:20.081
We were supposed to be VIPs, you see:
just lost himself into drinking!

19:20.288 --> 19:23.583
So we thought better now have an honourable
retreat, you see.

19:23.784 --> 19:28.139
So we got up and walked out of that place

19:28.340 --> 19:30.101
and this fellow didn’t even come
to wish us.

19:30.302 --> 19:33.263
And these officers, the Russian officers,
didn’t drink,

19:33.464 --> 19:35.993
and didn’t do anything, and they were
laughing and laughing.

19:36.194 --> 19:38.066
He said, “See now, this is Christianity!

19:38.267 --> 19:41.086
That’s why we didn’t want to take
to Christianity.”

19:41.287 --> 19:44.238
So I said, “But see, that’s not Christ.”

19:44.439 --> 19:48.045
They said, “That’s true, but what these
people are saying, is it Christianity?”

19:48.246 --> 19:49.864
I said, “It’s not.”

19:50.064 --> 19:54.484
Now this gentleman, you see, was supposed
to be

19:54.685 --> 19:59.668
the highest person in spirituality living
in Russia!

19:59.869 --> 20:02.998
So they have told me a story about
the tzars.

20:03.199 --> 20:06.693
You see, tzars wanted to have some religion
because they thought,

20:06.894 --> 20:11.101
“Everybody’s having a religion, we have
no religion. Must have some religion.”

20:11.302 --> 20:15.430
So they sent for some people

20:15.631 --> 20:18.903
and the people who came forward were
Catholics to begin with.

20:19.104 --> 20:24.431
So the Catholics said, “All right, you can
drink in Catholic religion.”

20:24.632 --> 20:27.244
I don’t know how they got this idea, but
it’s all right.

20:27.445 --> 20:33.512
“Catholic religion you can drink but you
cannot have more than one wife.”

20:33.713 --> 20:35.735
The tzar said, “No, that’s not possible!

20:35.936 --> 20:38.834
We have to have many tsarinas, you see,
for different purposes.

20:39.035 --> 20:43.073
So we can’t have that religion!”
So they cancelled it.

20:43.274 --> 20:47.303
So then the Islam: you see that time
I think they were no hindus available,

20:47.504 --> 20:49.966
thank God!

20:50.720 --> 20:54.425
They had the Islam, Islam people went,
and the Islamic people said,

20:54.626 --> 20:58.840
“No, all right, you can have five wives,
it’s all right,

20:59.041 --> 21:05.238
but you cannot drink.” They said,
“That’s impossible!

21:05.439 --> 21:10.235
How can we follow Islam? That’s not
possible!” So, cancel it!

21:10.436 --> 21:13.285
So these orthodox people — orthodox,
you see,

21:13.486 --> 21:15.892
the word orthodox remember that — they
came.

21:16.093 --> 21:18.892
They said, “No, we are just in the centre,
you see.

21:19.093 --> 21:22.332
We don’t mind if you drink,

21:22.533 --> 21:25.314
we don’t mind if you have many wives,
we don’t mind.

21:25.536 --> 21:28.188
Only thing is, you have to pay us well!”

21:28.389 --> 21:32.702
Tzars said, “All right, that’s good, let’s
have this religion!”

21:33.440 --> 21:36.450
And that’s how they had this religion
there.

21:36.651 --> 21:39.382
So this is the situation of the religion
today.

21:39.583 --> 21:48.663
All these religions have become sort
of deformed statues, good for nothing.

21:48.864 --> 21:52.747
So now the inner religion within us is
the Sahaja dharma,

21:52.948 --> 21:56.941
which has to be fully followed.

21:57.142 --> 22:01.858
Now, I told, say in India, that now you
are all become Sahajas.

22:02.059 --> 22:09.250
The story is like this, that there was
a villager who became Christian.

22:09.451 --> 22:13.966
So he came down to Allahabad to become
Christian.

22:14.167 --> 22:16.147
So he told them that, “You have to give
me a big name

22:16.348 --> 22:19.533
because now I am Saheb, you see, I have
become an English man.

22:19.734 --> 22:22.229
So you better give me a big name.”
They said, “What name you want?”

22:22.430 --> 22:24.938
He said, “Give me the name of Alexander
the Great!”

22:25.139 --> 22:28.946
So they called him Alexander. But his name
was Blondie, you see.

22:29.147 --> 22:35.114
His real Indian name was Bhoora, so they
called him Alexander Bhoora.

22:35.314 --> 22:38.300
So Mr. Alexander Bhoora came to Allahabad

22:38.501 --> 22:41.498
and went to the River Ganges for having
his bath.

22:41.699 --> 22:45.706
So the priest said, the pastor, he said,
“You can’t do that!”

22:45.907 --> 22:48.172
He said, “Why? Why can’t I do that?”

22:48.373 --> 22:50.961
He said, “No, you can’t go and have bath
in the River Ganges

22:51.162 --> 22:53.110
because the Christianity will drop out,
you see!”

22:53.311 --> 22:56.296
If he goes and has a bath in the River
Ganges.

22:56.497 --> 22:58.339
He said, “This you can’t do!”

22:58.540 --> 23:02.719
So Alexander Bhoora said, “If I have become
saheb,

23:02.920 --> 23:07.041
I have become an Englishman, that doesn’t
mean I have given up my religion!”

23:07.242 --> 23:12.120
You see! This is exactly what is happening
to us

23:12.321 --> 23:15.873
when we try to follow any religion
whatsoever.

23:16.074 --> 23:21.791
Now we are all identified with our
so-called religions in which we were born.

23:21.992 --> 23:26.511
For example, if I told Indians, “Now,
you don’t go to temples!

23:26.712 --> 23:30.651
You are not to go to any temple, even if it
is a swayambhu temple,

23:30.852 --> 23:35.313
unless and until you have told me, don’t go
to a swayambhu temple at any cost.”

23:35.514 --> 23:42.842
There are many churches also where there
are very good statues, we can say,

23:43.043 --> 23:48.240
or have got something which are really
swayambhus, but they are very few.

23:48.441 --> 23:51.521
So you tell me and then go. But they
wouldn’t listen to me,

23:51.722 --> 23:56.562
they won’t listen, and when they go there
they catch on their Agnyas.

23:56.784 --> 24:02.466
Once I went to see one temple which was
of course a swayambhu temple, no doubt,

24:02.667 --> 24:06.506
so some Sahaj Yogis decided to go there.

24:06.707 --> 24:08.914
But I didn’t ask them, they didn’t tell
me.

24:09.114 --> 24:11.753
When they came back, as soon as they
saw me, they all fainted.

24:11.960 --> 24:16.692
I said, “What happened? Where did you go?”
“Oh, we went to this temple.”

24:16.893 --> 24:20.067
I said, “Why? You never told me. And what
do you have here?”

24:20.268 --> 24:23.580
You see, the Brahmin put the teeka
(bindi) and it’s finished!

24:23.781 --> 24:26.329
Then it took them one month to clear out!

24:26.530 --> 24:31.164
Now they don’t go, they’ve had enough
of it.

24:31.365 --> 24:34.853
Same with the Christians:

24:35.054 --> 24:38.360
now the other day I heard about the Paris
episode

24:38.561 --> 24:45.703
where people wanted to have weddings
in the church, in Paris.

24:45.904 --> 24:47.907
So they must have special dresses!

24:48.108 --> 24:53.293
So somebody came here to buy some special
dresses from… what shop is that?

24:53.494 --> 24:55.709
I forgot the name, some big name.

24:55.910 --> 25:02.258
So the special dresses must be worn because
they have to go to the church!

25:02.459 --> 25:08.119
And when they came out of the church with
those dresses, they had become bhoots.

25:08.320 --> 25:11.841
I was surprised, what has happened to these
twenty-five of them?

25:12.042 --> 25:16.612
What has happened is that in the church
there are many dead bodies buried,

25:16.813 --> 25:18.752
and they are all caught up.

25:18.953 --> 25:23.740
So when you go also to see the beautiful
architecture,

25:23.941 --> 25:29.902
go with a detached mind. Don’t think
that you belong to that church.

25:30.103 --> 25:33.161
You don’t belong to any church. You don’t
belong to any temple.

25:33.362 --> 25:37.873
Don’t belong to any one of these forms,
then only you will ascend.

25:38.074 --> 25:44.692
And I have to tell you today that Christ
did not belong to any religion.

25:47.015 --> 25:53.610
He didn’t follow any religion. He followed
His own spiritual religion.

25:53.811 --> 25:56.778
When He went to one church where there
were people who were discussing,

25:56.979 --> 26:01.915
I mean they were Jews, He went there
and He was talking to them.

26:02.116 --> 26:06.716
The other day I saw a beautiful painting
they had given on the newspaper,

26:06.917 --> 26:11.730
a very beautiful famous painting where
Christ is talking to the doctors

26:11.931 --> 26:20.876
and He is holding His, rubbing His Left
Swadhishthana, very nicely,

26:21.077 --> 26:24.113
and all the doctors, you see, one of them
is listening to Him,

26:24.314 --> 26:26.607
one of them is looking at Him, sneering
at Him,

26:26.808 --> 26:29.002
another one is little bit paying attention
to Him.

26:29.203 --> 26:34.013
He’s just rubbing His Left Swadhishthan.

26:34.364 --> 26:37.391
It’s clearly [shown]. You can see it
so clearly!

26:37.592 --> 26:41.825
And so now, with these new achievements,
you must rise above all these things

26:42.026 --> 26:47.709
and you must understand that we have to be
very independently looking at ourselves.

26:47.910 --> 26:51.848
We are no more belonging to any religion.

26:52.049 --> 26:57.513
We belong to the religion of God which is
Sahaj.

26:57.714 --> 27:00.818
And Sahaj is the religion, it will spread

27:01.019 --> 27:05.354
only when you really become nothing
but Sahaj.

27:05.555 --> 27:09.088
But that’s something I don’t understand —
it doesn’t work out.

27:09.289 --> 27:14.764
I met somebody from, I forget that, there
was, say, called

27:14.965 --> 27:21.683
‘Hamaty’ or something who was supposed
to be an incarnation or something.

27:21.884 --> 27:26.419
His disciples absolutely, you should say
that they behave in such a manner

27:26.620 --> 27:32.652
that you can’t believe it, how ardently
they believe in this man.

27:32.853 --> 27:37.248
Whatever he says, whatever he does,
how they believe in him.

27:37.449 --> 27:39.271
It’s very surprising.

27:39.472 --> 27:45.590
You meet anyone who is following any guru,
anyone,

27:45.791 --> 27:49.931
you’ll be surprised the way they are
fanatic about this fellow

27:50.132 --> 27:53.348
and they will not hear anything against.
Leave alone that,

27:53.549 --> 27:58.754
but if he says, “You stand on your head
for the whole night,” they will do it!

27:58.976 --> 28:03.547
I don’t know what happens: when it comes
to falsehood, we try to follow it,

28:03.748 --> 28:07.433
and when we know the truth, this is
the truth,

28:07.634 --> 28:13.552
then we take advantage and we try
to compromise.

28:13.753 --> 28:19.698
We think the truth will not do anything
about it.

28:19.919 --> 28:22.826
Not that truth will punish you, it will
not,

28:23.027 --> 28:26.273
because you are realised souls. It will
not.

28:26.474 --> 28:29.660
It will not punish you up to a point.

28:29.861 --> 28:37.166
But remember that Ekadasha is absolutely
working at the same time.

28:37.367 --> 28:39.304
If we do anything wrong,

28:39.505 --> 28:43.943
like these people went to the church,
they were all caught up.

28:44.356 --> 28:47.707
Now they may say that, “Mother, why should
we be caught up?

28:47.908 --> 28:50.714
We are Sahaj Yogis.”

28:50.915 --> 28:56.328
Because you are vulnerable, you are
vulnerable.

28:56.529 --> 28:58.704
Yet you have not reached that stage.

28:58.905 --> 29:01.891
If you reach that stage, then when you
go there,

29:02.092 --> 29:06.863
all the church people will come out
of the church and run away.

29:07.064 --> 29:10.405
They’ll start shaking before you.

29:10.606 --> 29:12.274
They will not know what has happened.

29:12.475 --> 29:15.118
I have seen when I enter into any church

29:15.319 --> 29:18.478
all the candles start going chuk, chuk,
chuk, chuk, chuk, chuk,

29:18.679 --> 29:21.205
and people start wondering what has
happened.

29:21.406 --> 29:25.712
Even when they are having a dinner or
something and there is a candlelight dinner

29:25.913 --> 29:31.541
I am surprised the way every candle starts
flickering and people start looking.

29:31.742 --> 29:34.315
Because the bhoots are sitting before them,
you see,

29:34.516 --> 29:39.494
so the candles immediately show that
these are the bhoots sitting here.

29:39.695 --> 29:44.249
With all this knowledge that you have,
the light you have within yourself,

29:44.450 --> 29:46.981
by which you are enlightened, still if you
are going

29:47.182 --> 29:51.698
to these left and right-sided things,
it’s very, very dangerous.

29:51.899 --> 29:58.853
We see that also, today, I must tell you
about the part that is politics.

29:59.054 --> 30:02.410
In politics also these people have
developed two types of theories:

30:02.611 --> 30:04.782
one is left-sided, one right-sided.

30:04.983 --> 30:07.944
The left-sided theories are democratic,

30:08.145 --> 30:11.004
where you can indulge into anything
you like.

30:11.205 --> 30:13.434
It’s the individual that is important.

30:13.643 --> 30:15.993
The individual indulges into everything

30:16.194 --> 30:20.425
and you should not stop him from doing
whatever he likes, he’s an individual:

30:20.626 --> 30:23.595
so he has a right to cut his nose, he has
a right to cut his eyes,

30:23.796 --> 30:26.765
to do what he likes.

30:26.966 --> 30:30.706
An individual is allowed to do what
he likes to do,

30:30.907 --> 30:37.488
and then what happens [is] that we find
this democracy becomes a demonocracy:

30:37.689 --> 30:42.423
everybody is a demon. Everybody is busy
cutting throats,

30:42.624 --> 30:48.148
cutting all the basis and the roots of life

30:48.349 --> 30:52.311
because everybody is Brahma, becomes
a great personality,

30:52.512 --> 30:57.933
because the individual is so great and
the collective is lost, completely lost.

30:58.134 --> 31:02.877
But on the other side, where it is more
discipline,

31:03.078 --> 31:08.080
more aggressiveness, more controls and
everything [with] the Right Side,

31:08.281 --> 31:13.180
which we can call as communism, where
people are controlled all the time.

31:13.381 --> 31:18.121
Now why? Because for the collective
the individual must sacrifice.

31:18.322 --> 31:22.908
In that case, the individuals become weak
and if the individuals are weak,

31:23.109 --> 31:27.448
then the collective cannot be strong:
it cannot be strong.

31:27.649 --> 31:30.634
The individuals have to be strong.
For example, you will see

31:30.835 --> 31:34.763
that the people who come from communist
countries,

31:34.964 --> 31:38.803
they drink more than people who can
drink here.

31:39.004 --> 31:43.397
Or those who come, say from Islamic
countries, where they don’t touch anything,

31:43.598 --> 31:46.492
can drink more than even sardarjees.

31:46.693 --> 31:51.208
So you can imagine what is the situation
of human beings is

31:51.409 --> 31:56.510
that, out of fear if you try to control
him, he goes to the Right Side.

31:56.711 --> 32:00.897
But he is in no way perfected, he’s not
transformed,

32:01.098 --> 32:06.823
he doesn’t accept the situation, he doesn’t
become that,

32:07.024 --> 32:11.432
he doesn’t have that power to control
himself.

32:11.633 --> 32:18.441
He doesn’t get over his sinning aptitudes.
He’s still there.

32:18.642 --> 32:22.992
As soon as he gets a chance he falls
into it. So that fails.

32:23.193 --> 32:25.643
So the individuals are weak in that case.

32:25.844 --> 32:29.698
And where there is complete abandonment,
do what you like,

32:29.899 --> 32:35.633
live the way you like, indulgences, all
kinds of things, so you find [decadence].

32:35.834 --> 32:38.016
I mean, everyday you see and you say,

32:38.217 --> 32:41.383
“Oh God, this is a decadent society,
this is happening!”

32:41.584 --> 32:46.870
Decadence is because an individual
[to] whom you have given all these powers,

32:47.071 --> 32:49.955
has no power to bear them.

32:50.156 --> 32:55.907
An individual cannot bear money. He
cannot bear power of any kind.

32:56.108 --> 33:01.985
He cannot bear love. He cannot bear
kindness.

33:02.186 --> 33:08.405
He cannot understand peace because he’s
still an individual.

33:08.606 --> 33:13.276
But when an individual becomes
the collective -

33:13.477 --> 33:16.723
this is the ascent through the central
path -

33:16.924 --> 33:25.709
when he becomes the collective, in his
strength he strengthens the collective.

33:25.910 --> 33:31.987
And also the collective looks after,
protects, and guides the individual.

33:32.188 --> 33:33.901
This is what Sahaj Yoga is.

33:34.102 --> 33:41.177
So the politics of Sahaj Yoga is that you
have to become the collective personality.

33:41.426 --> 33:48.035
And there where we feel that still we are
something great,

33:48.236 --> 33:56.520
we are different, we are Indians or we are
from England or from France,

33:56.721 --> 34:00.309
still if you are identified then you are
not collective.

34:00.510 --> 34:06.094
In collective sense we are all one, part
and parcel of one being.

34:06.295 --> 34:10.689
Then you are really acting as collective
being

34:10.903 --> 34:13.933
and you are one with the Divine. Where
the Sun is looking after you,

34:14.134 --> 34:17.430
the Moon is looking after you, the winds
are looking after you;

34:17.631 --> 34:24.112
all the Mother Earth and all these
elements are working.

34:24.313 --> 34:29.494
Ether, everything is working for you and
you are so well-protected

34:29.695 --> 34:36.514
and blessed by the special quality to enjoy
the joy.

34:36.715 --> 34:39.820
Then you really become sensitive to that
joy,

34:40.021 --> 34:42.942
when you are one with the whole.

34:43.143 --> 34:47.793
Like if supposing this finger or this
finger is not one with the whole,

34:47.994 --> 34:52.100
is numbed out… as it happens in leprosy,
what happens

34:52.301 --> 34:54.503
that this finger becomes numbed out.

34:54.704 --> 35:00.484
Even if a rat eats it off we don’t know

35:00.685 --> 35:05.919
because there is no connection, no nerves
acting, it’s insensitive.

35:06.120 --> 35:09.947
In the same way if you are not collective

35:10.148 --> 35:17.255
and not bothered about collective you are
going to be dropped out.

35:17.456 --> 35:21.222
You are not going to be there to enjoy

35:21.423 --> 35:27.083
the beauties of your own glory and that
of the collective.

35:27.284 --> 35:31.117
So one has to understand that we have to be
strong ourselves,

35:31.323 --> 35:35.036
we have to ascend and we have to be
collective.

35:35.237 --> 35:38.527
It’s very easy to find out faults with
others.

35:38.728 --> 35:41.829
Very easy to find faults with the leaders.

35:42.030 --> 35:47.096
Very easy to find faults also with Sahaj
Yoga, sometimes with me.

35:47.297 --> 35:52.491
Better find faults with yourself. The rest
I’ll look after.

35:52.692 --> 35:57.188
First you just find faults with yourself
and try to understand others

35:57.389 --> 36:02.422
and love others and enjoy the company
of others.

36:02.623 --> 36:06.254
This, once you decide that we have
to enjoy,

36:06.455 --> 36:09.939
I tell you, it’s so spontaneous.

36:10.140 --> 36:13.777
Just this decision, this faith, within you

36:13.978 --> 36:17.549
that, “I’m going to enjoy now my Spirit.

36:17.750 --> 36:21.653
I’m going to enjoy the collective within
me,” that’s the Spirit.

36:21.854 --> 36:27.513
Just this decision itself will give you
the power to enjoy.

36:27.714 --> 36:31.256
But the decision should be firm,
no hypocrisy,

36:31.457 --> 36:35.332
no playing games, no ego, no conditioning,
nothing,

36:35.533 --> 36:41.441
just pure desire within us that we have
to be the Spirit.

36:41.642 --> 36:45.858
And the Spirit which is the collective
being within us.

36:46.059 --> 36:50.831
I hope today on this day of resurrection,

36:51.032 --> 36:57.756
we have to be thankful to Christ very much
for showing us the way

36:57.957 --> 37:08.935
and also we have to be very much concerned
and alerted about ourselves:

37:09.136 --> 37:11.953
Where are we? Where do we stand?

37:12.154 --> 37:15.514
What are we up to? What are we doing?

37:15.715 --> 37:19.455
What is our responsibility? What is
expected of us?

37:19.656 --> 37:22.545
Why all these blessings are given to us?

37:22.746 --> 37:26.489
There’s no sacrifice in Sahaj Yoga,
no sacrifice.

37:26.690 --> 37:31.531
Nobody wants you anything to commit
or to do

37:31.732 --> 37:34.838
or membership or anything like that.

37:35.039 --> 37:40.484
I think it’s my commitment. As I said,
that God has the commitment

37:40.685 --> 37:47.872
but you also have one commitment that
your desire should be pure.

37:48.073 --> 37:51.934
That’s the only thing, that, “Let my desire
be pure!

37:52.135 --> 37:55.389
No impurities of any kind, should work it
out.”

37:55.590 --> 38:00.108
As Christ had His desire, so pure, and
that’s what He achieved.

38:00.309 --> 38:03.430
I am sure you can all achieve a lot in your
life.

38:03.631 --> 38:08.339
Today is my sixty-fifth birthday. Now
imagine, I’m sixty-five years of age

38:08.540 --> 38:16.692
and at this age most of the ladies, you
see, just, I don’t know what they do.

38:17.987 --> 38:26.518
So now you must come up and work out
everything

38:26.719 --> 38:32.444
as far as possible, thinking that we all
have to stand up.

38:32.645 --> 38:36.893
Now the children are coming up. They are
also going to stand up.

38:37.094 --> 38:39.365
You are all looking younger to me and
younger to me.

38:39.566 --> 38:42.866
Every day I see you, you look younger.
Sometimes I don’t even recognise you,

38:43.067 --> 38:48.964
the way you look younger and I think,
is he the son or is he the father?

38:52.810 --> 38:59.436
So, the situation is such that you are
all blessed:

38:59.666 --> 39:02.905
you’ve got jobs, you’ve got everything.
And everybody tells me,

39:03.106 --> 39:05.471
“Mother, this is what has happened,
that has happened!” everything.

39:05.672 --> 39:10.603
Now, so what? These are temptations,
be careful.

39:10.804 --> 39:12.893
This is not what you wanted.

39:13.094 --> 39:19.949
What you wanted is the state of that
complete faith within yourself

39:20.155 --> 39:25.265
where you don’t have to ask, nothing —
everything will work out.

39:25.504 --> 39:30.806
Everything will work out. It works!
That’s the point is.

39:31.007 --> 39:34.970
So, I hope next time when we meet

39:35.171 --> 39:39.634
I’ll see even younger people than what
I see today

39:39.835 --> 39:42.672
and I’ll be able to recognise you.

39:42.873 --> 39:45.882
Christ died at a very, very young age, very
young age.

39:46.083 --> 39:53.865
He was very young, I must say. But how
much He has done for humanity.

39:54.066 --> 39:58.078
Nobody could have achieved that much
in that small age as He has done it.

39:58.279 --> 40:01.206
It’s remarkable! It’s really remarkable!

40:01.407 --> 40:06.235
That’s what I expect you to follow, His
footsteps in doing remarkable things.

40:06.436 --> 40:11.224
And let me see all of you, every one of you
have to do something great.

40:11.425 --> 40:14.052
And today is the day of certain promises.

40:14.253 --> 40:15.760
May God bless you for that.

40:15.961 --> 40:21.171
And I thank you very much for this birthday
of mine.
