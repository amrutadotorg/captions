00:00:01.253 --> 00:00:07.597
Today we are here to celebrate
the resurrection of Christ.

00:00:07.798 --> 00:00:14.698
Resurrection of Christ has the greatest
significance for all the Sahaj Yogis.

00:00:14.899 --> 00:00:19.801
And we have to understand that He
resurrected Himself

00:00:20.002 --> 00:00:23.343
so that we could resurrect ourselves.

00:00:23.544 --> 00:00:29.342
The message of His life is His resurrection
and not His cross.

00:00:29.543 --> 00:00:35.292
He bore the cross for us and we don’t have
to bear anymore.

00:00:35.493 --> 00:00:38.774
I see lots of people having this drama
going on:

00:00:38.975 --> 00:00:42.618
they are carrying the cross across

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:46.384
to show as if we are going to do the job
for Christ!

00:00:46.585 --> 00:00:51.731
As if He has left some work to be done
by these people who play a drama.

00:00:51.932 --> 00:00:56.458
But all this drama is to deceive yourself
and to deceive others.

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:05.920
There’s no sense in playing such useless
things to show how Christ suffered.

00:01:06.121 --> 00:01:10.356
To make you weep and to make you cry,
Christ did not suffer.

00:01:10.557 --> 00:01:14.557
He suffered that you should enjoy,
that you should be happy,

00:01:14.758 --> 00:01:20.594
that you should lead a life of complete
bliss and gratitude

00:01:20.795 --> 00:01:23.568
to the Almighty who has created you.

00:01:23.769 --> 00:01:26.452
He would never like you to be unhappy.

00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:31.153
Which father would like his son to be
unhappy?

00:01:31.354 --> 00:01:37.384
So we have to understand that His message
of His life,

00:01:37.585 --> 00:01:43.810
why He came on this Earth to do the
greatest job is that of resurrection.

00:01:44.011 --> 00:01:49.135
If He had not resurrected Himself, I could
not have worked out Sahaj Yoga.

00:01:49.336 --> 00:01:53.209
So we have to be eternally thankful
to His life and to Him,

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:59.993
the way He did all these difficult tasks,
taking upon Himself.

00:02:00.194 --> 00:02:03.420
That, we cannot do, we human beings, cannot
do it.

00:02:03.621 --> 00:02:07.923
It’s only He being the Divine, He being
the Om,

00:02:08.124 --> 00:02:14.408
He being the Logos, He being the Brahma
could do it.

00:02:15.003 --> 00:02:18.093
But now you all have ascended.

00:02:18.294 --> 00:02:23.629
I can see on your faces: Christ writ large
on your faces.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.054
It’s beautifully shining in your eyes and
twinkling.

00:02:28.255 --> 00:02:33.576
He’s there within us, in our hearts,
in our eyes,

00:02:33.777 --> 00:02:39.092
and He has resurrected Himself and
He has resurrected you, too.

00:02:39.293 --> 00:02:43.244
But now it is for you to resurrect other
people.

00:02:43.445 --> 00:02:47.669
You can resurrect other people, this is
the power you have got it

00:02:47.974 --> 00:02:51.170
through Him, maybe, or through your
Kundalini.

00:02:51.371 --> 00:02:54.798
But you have this power to resurrect other
people,

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:59.111
but first and foremost thing [is] you have
to be strong like Christ:

00:02:59.312 --> 00:03:06.321
how He obeyed His Mother and how He
obeyed all the demands of His life.

00:03:06.522 --> 00:03:13.208
How He was committed and how He dedicated
Himself to this single task.

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:17.824
He didn’t bother as to develop His monetary
side

00:03:18.025 --> 00:03:20.634
or to become some sort of a big officer

00:03:20.834 --> 00:03:24.630
or to become another great rider,
or a swimmer,

00:03:24.831 --> 00:03:29.716
or climb on the Alps, some sort of a thing
like that.

00:03:31.224 --> 00:03:35.991
He didn’t try all these tricks, and didn’t
try to hanker after all these things

00:03:36.192 --> 00:03:41.484
that sometimes make us quite mad.

00:03:41.685 --> 00:03:53.726
What He did was to establish His identity
as the Brahma itself,

00:03:53.927 --> 00:03:58.643
as the Divine vibrations itself, which He
established.

00:03:58.844 --> 00:04:05.554
And what you have to do is to establish
yourself as the resurrected people,

00:04:05.755 --> 00:04:10.546
as the realised souls, as the Sahaj Yogis.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.794
And this is going to be very easy.

00:04:13.995 --> 00:04:18.497
Now everything is made easy for you:
your realisation,

00:04:18.698 --> 00:04:26.369
then your powers, everything has
beautifully settled within you.

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.752
It has worked out so beautifully, slowly
and steadily.

00:04:30.975 --> 00:04:40.601
I don’t think I have ever tried to force
you to do something

00:04:40.802 --> 00:04:44.345
or have compelled you to do something.

00:04:44.551 --> 00:04:49.269
But through your own ascent you can see
what’s wrong with you

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.542
or with the people about whom we are
talking.

00:04:53.743 --> 00:05:02.314
And then you can also know through all
these powers whatever is to be known.

00:05:02.515 --> 00:05:06.687
All that is unknown can be your own,
everything.

00:05:06.896 --> 00:05:11.683
But the attention should be towards your
ascent, towards the state.

00:05:11.884 --> 00:05:16.649
Now ascent is not some sort of a physical
process.

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.010
It is not that you ascend some staircases.

00:05:20.211 --> 00:05:26.211
It is a state. It’s a state of your
personality.

00:05:26.412 --> 00:05:28.396
And there where I always say…

00:05:28.597 --> 00:05:33.944
Excuse me, I think I’ll... The sun is
showing its results.

00:05:34.145 --> 00:05:36.134
See how the sun listens to me!

00:05:36.335 --> 00:05:39.673
Can you help me, a little bit, to take out
things.

00:05:39.874 --> 00:05:44.699
Very hot for me, I don’t know what
about you people.

00:05:45.064 --> 00:05:48.620
He’s just telling me off (the Sun).

00:06:04.732 --> 00:06:08.031
I forgot to tell you about the Sun so he’s
just troubling me,

00:06:08.232 --> 00:06:11.269
so I better tell!

00:06:24.244 --> 00:06:31.306
They have been telling for the last one
year, you see,

00:06:31.507 --> 00:06:35.908
we’ve been thinking of coming here
for this puja.

00:06:36.109 --> 00:06:40.976
And I was very anxious that we should have
the Easter Puja here,

00:06:41.177 --> 00:06:44.328
but the dates were not very suitable,

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:47.434
because those days the moon would be
waning.

00:06:47.635 --> 00:06:50.289
So I thought, “How will I do it without
the moon?

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:53.594
We have to have the moon there.
It’s important.”

00:06:53.795 --> 00:06:57.637
So I thought, “We’ll have it sometimes
later.”

00:06:57.838 --> 00:07:02.643
And suddenly it happened that I had to come
here: luckily I was here.

00:07:02.844 --> 00:07:06.559
And then on the television for the last one
week, they have been telling

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:12.626
that it’s going to rain heavily, it’s going
to be very clouded

00:07:12.827 --> 00:07:15.838
and the temperature is going to be very bad

00:07:16.039 --> 00:07:22.512
and it’s going to be very, very heavy
rains.

00:07:36.075 --> 00:07:39.330
And again and again, every night, every
time

00:07:39.531 --> 00:07:45.029
they announced about the weather it was
looking even worse, every time.

00:07:45.243 --> 00:07:50.430
So I thought, “Now what to do?”

00:07:53.501 --> 00:07:56.532
If you ask the clouds to move out

00:07:56.751 --> 00:08:02.960
you have to have a tremendous breeze
and that may spoil your tent.

00:08:03.161 --> 00:08:05.480
So somehow or other, you see,

00:08:05.681 --> 00:08:11.600
I just told the clouds that, “You’d better
move on to Newfoundland,

00:08:11.801 --> 00:08:18.256
slowly, steadily, not with great speed.”
And they did it.

00:08:20.307 --> 00:08:23.435
And then the Sun which was very bright came
out.

00:08:23.636 --> 00:08:27.609
Early in the morning I saw Him, red like my
sari.

00:08:27.823 --> 00:08:34.167
So beautiful it was. And you were all
asleep but I was awake, very early.

00:08:34.368 --> 00:08:40.055
And I was watching the way it came up: just
like my bindi it came up.

00:08:40.256 --> 00:08:43.586
I saw it, and I said, “Look at the sun!

00:08:43.787 --> 00:08:50.200
How obedient, how dedicated, how
beautiful!”

00:08:50.401 --> 00:08:53.633
Whatever it is: today is Mother’s Puja,

00:08:53.834 --> 00:08:58.932
you have to have proper light, you have
to have proper temperature.

00:08:59.133 --> 00:09:01.882
So look at the sky! Look at everything!

00:09:02.083 --> 00:09:05.900
And then gradually it became pink like your
faces.

00:09:06.101 --> 00:09:11.302
It’s beautiful! It became pink, beautifully
pink, and then now it’s shining.

00:09:11.503 --> 00:09:18.222
I’m sorry I should have given full tribute
to the Sun, the way He has acted.

00:09:18.423 --> 00:09:23.936
So that’s why He is troubling me a little
bit, you see, to remind me!

00:09:25.621 --> 00:09:37.283
So, as you know the Sun is the Agnya
chakra.

00:09:37.554 --> 00:09:42.647
Christ resides in the Sun.

00:09:42.893 --> 00:09:51.480
And in the body, in the being, He is
the Spirit.

00:09:51.681 --> 00:09:54.128
When He’s the Spirit, He’s the moon.

00:09:54.343 --> 00:09:58.746
And when He acts on the Agnya, He’s
the Sun.

00:09:58.947 --> 00:10:03.713
Now we have seen in His life

00:10:03.914 --> 00:10:09.673
that He was absolutely spotlessly
immaculate.

00:10:10.039 --> 00:10:17.959
He had no defects in Him. He was
a perfect personality.

00:10:18.459 --> 00:10:22.483
“Then why did He want to resurrect?”, one
can ask.

00:10:22.684 --> 00:10:27.010
What is in His time, is the resurrection.

00:10:27.211 --> 00:10:34.631
His resurrection is like making the way
through the Agnya chakra

00:10:34.832 --> 00:10:38.522
for all of you to pass through it.

00:10:38.723 --> 00:10:43.225
He was like the gate, or we should say
He was the One

00:10:43.426 --> 00:10:47.857
who opened the gate for all of
you.

00:10:48.058 --> 00:10:51.825
Because He was so perfect,

00:10:52.242 --> 00:10:56.848
He had no problems as we have of our
chakras, our Kundalini.

00:10:57.049 --> 00:11:05.636
He had no problems. But He was
the complete compassion

00:11:05.837 --> 00:11:14.339
in the nature of vibrations: the vibrations
became complete compassion.

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:18.482
So much so that even when He was
resurrected

00:11:18.683 --> 00:11:23.259
and even before that when He was crucified

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:31.086
He said that, “Oh, God, the Father, please
forgive those people

00:11:31.287 --> 00:11:34.059
because they do not know what they
are doing.‎”

00:11:34.289 --> 00:11:38.106
Such forgiveness, such compassion!

00:11:38.307 --> 00:11:41.995
And the Mother had to watch all that,
keeping quiet,

00:11:42.218 --> 00:11:47.381
because that was the game, that was
the thing one had to do.

00:11:47.582 --> 00:11:51.299
He had to play His game and He played it
so well.

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:56.352
So now when we talk about Christ, we have
to remember one thing:

00:11:56.553 --> 00:12:02.555
that He has done all this for us, now what
are we going to do for Him?

00:12:02.756 --> 00:12:05.257
He is the pattern we have to follow.

00:12:05.458 --> 00:12:08.134
Supposing if that is the pattern we have to
follow,

00:12:08.335 --> 00:12:13.746
then it’s not that we carry the cross
on our shoulder.

00:12:13.947 --> 00:12:16.051
That’s not the pattern you have to follow.

00:12:16.252 --> 00:12:19.185
Many people think [that] because He carried
the cross, we can carry the cross.

00:12:19.386 --> 00:12:21.282
Anybody can carry the cross!

00:12:21.483 --> 00:12:29.454
In India, if you give about five rupees to
a loader, he can carry a cross across!

00:12:29.655 --> 00:12:31.435
What is so great about it?

00:12:31.673 --> 00:12:36.843
What is so great in carrying a cross
on your shoulder?

00:12:37.044 --> 00:12:41.888
It’s nothing something great. Any wrestler
can do it, anybody can do it.

00:12:42.096 --> 00:12:46.283
That’s not the point! The point is we have
to carry

00:12:46.484 --> 00:12:51.774
the work of Christ, of resurrection.
That is what we have to realise.

00:12:51.974 --> 00:12:57.719
We have to understand the importance
of our being, of our lives,

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:03.057
like Christ understood that He has come
for this great job here.

00:13:03.258 --> 00:13:05.406
And though He came as a human being,

00:13:05.607 --> 00:13:10.120
though He came as an ordinary son
of an ordinary carpenter.

00:13:10.321 --> 00:13:15.713
Though on this Earth He had a body and He
lived like other human beings,

00:13:15.927 --> 00:13:19.785
still He knew what He had to do,

00:13:19.986 --> 00:13:23.394
He knew what He had to achieve and He
achieved it.

00:13:23.594 --> 00:13:26.582
I think His was the most difficult task,

00:13:26.804 --> 00:13:30.145
which He achieved and which He
furnished it, so well,

00:13:30.346 --> 00:13:33.838
that today we are having all the benefits
of that.

00:13:34.039 --> 00:13:38.568
Now let us see if we have done something
for Sahaj Yoga or not.

00:13:38.769 --> 00:13:42.554
We all should examine ourselves: what have
we done for Sahaj Yoga?

00:13:42.754 --> 00:13:45.443
Not carrying the cross, I mean to say.

00:13:45.644 --> 00:13:49.126
Some people think when they travel in India
and if they carry

00:13:49.327 --> 00:13:53.162
the luggage of people downward, they are
carrying the cross of Christ.

00:13:53.363 --> 00:13:54.680
That’s not the way!

00:13:54.881 --> 00:13:57.947
It’s something very, very serious one has
to think about.

00:13:58.154 --> 00:14:05.653
And that seriousness is: how far we have
achieved that state,

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:08.035
for that what have we done?

00:14:08.236 --> 00:14:11.245
And a simple thing I have been asking
all of you:

00:14:11.446 --> 00:14:15.069
you have to meditate every day!

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:18.666
All of you have to meditate everyday.

00:14:18.867 --> 00:14:23.909
But somehow nobody has time to meditate.

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:29.927
We are having these watches just to know
that we have to meditate,

00:14:30.128 --> 00:14:33.445
not for anything else. Our lives are
for meditation.

00:14:33.646 --> 00:14:39.020
You need not spend all your twenty-four
hours, but you have to meditate!

00:14:39.221 --> 00:14:44.172
Everyday you must meditate. If you
meditate your children will meditate.

00:14:44.373 --> 00:14:49.327
And meditation is such a simple thing
for you, made so easy

00:14:49.528 --> 00:14:53.790
that all the elements you can see work
it out.

00:14:53.991 --> 00:14:57.001
All your chakras are made of different
elements

00:14:57.202 --> 00:15:00.703
and when you clear out with the different
style —

00:15:00.904 --> 00:15:04.486
I mean, you know all the methods and
the techniques of Sahaj Yoga —

00:15:04.687 --> 00:15:08.694
with that when you clear out the chakras,
when you clear them out

00:15:08.895 --> 00:15:17.270
you are absolutely free, absolutely at that
stage where you have to be.

00:15:17.471 --> 00:15:21.729
But if you do not do this much even —
is to meditate —

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:26.515
it’s going to be very, very difficult
for me and for you

00:15:26.716 --> 00:15:30.582
to achieve, for which you have come
on this Earth.

00:15:30.783 --> 00:15:34.739
It’s a tremendous task that I have taken
over, I know that,

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:38.745
but I know how to do it, and you also
know how to do it.

00:15:38.946 --> 00:15:45.091
But the trouble is you get entangled into
your different conditionings.

00:15:45.292 --> 00:15:49.115
Now, by now you must have realised,
all these so-called religions

00:15:49.316 --> 00:15:54.220
in anybody’s name: whether it is in the
name of Islam, in the name of Christianity,

00:15:54.421 --> 00:16:00.995
in the name of Hinduism, in the name
of Sikhism — all this is falsehood.

00:16:01.196 --> 00:16:05.241
It has no truth in it.

00:16:05.442 --> 00:16:09.291
They have all tried to use it for their
own purposes.

00:16:09.492 --> 00:16:15.177
There’s only one truth and that is:
all these great prophets

00:16:15.378 --> 00:16:19.967
and all these great incarnations came
on this Earth for your ascent

00:16:20.168 --> 00:16:26.141
and not for establishing those religions
who are just interested in money.

00:16:26.342 --> 00:16:29.130
In these religions also you will find
there are people

00:16:29.331 --> 00:16:32.339
who are either left-sided or right-sided.

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:37.115
There are some religions which preach
you should be very, very strict:

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:39.932
you should not do this, you should not
do that,

00:16:40.133 --> 00:16:42.495
you should not drink, you should not smoke.

00:16:42.696 --> 00:16:46.404
There are some who say you should not
marry, you should not look at women,

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:49.995
you should not look at men — all kinds
of restrictions.

00:16:50.217 --> 00:16:54.728
Even in Hinduism you will be surprised,
there are so many restrictions.

00:16:54.929 --> 00:17:02.587
If you see the amount of superstitions
that exist

00:17:02.788 --> 00:17:07.023
and that are created by brahmins in India
you will be shocked.

00:17:07.223 --> 00:17:09.101
For everything there’s a superstition:

00:17:09.302 --> 00:17:12.412
if you walk with the left hand ahead,
that means this,

00:17:12.613 --> 00:17:15.453
if you walk with the right hand, then
that means this;

00:17:15.654 --> 00:17:19.031
if you sit like this, that means that.
Everything!

00:17:19.232 --> 00:17:23.571
They have made a human being into a machine
and there’s no spontaneity about it.

00:17:23.772 --> 00:17:27.066
All kinds of absurdities there are
in Islam, too.

00:17:27.267 --> 00:17:31.521
But when we find them in a free place
like England,

00:17:31.722 --> 00:17:35.572
where there’s complete left-sidedness,
where you can do what you like,

00:17:35.773 --> 00:17:38.639
still you are a Christian: if you drink,
it’s all right;

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:43.322
if you have ten wives, it’s all right; you
have fifteen keeps, it’s all right.

00:17:43.523 --> 00:17:49.008
Anything you do is all right as long as you
go to church and pay money!

00:17:49.899 --> 00:17:54.373
So there’s nothing, especially for
the Protestants –

00:17:54.574 --> 00:17:59.333
that’s the religion I was born in, where
everything is allowed.

00:17:59.534 --> 00:18:03.240
Now when we come to this kind of a thing,
what is the Christian religion is,

00:18:03.455 --> 00:18:06.112
then, comes to, that, if you ask them
the road,

00:18:06.313 --> 00:18:11.277
they’ll tell you which way to go — that’s
Christianity. It’s coming to that end.

00:18:11.478 --> 00:18:16.078
Now, all these religions either are
indulging into the Right Side

00:18:16.279 --> 00:18:17.961
or onto the Left Side.

00:18:18.162 --> 00:18:22.922
Some people like the Left Side and some
people like the Right Side.

00:18:23.123 --> 00:18:26.353
I will tell you the story of a priest,
I went to see him in Russia.

00:18:26.554 --> 00:18:29.844
I think I have told it to some people
before.

00:18:30.045 --> 00:18:35.612
I went to Russia and the Russian people
asked me, “What would you like to see?”

00:18:35.813 --> 00:18:38.777
So I told them I would like to go and see
some churches.

00:18:38.978 --> 00:18:41.504
So they said, “All right, very good, we’ll
take you to a church.”

00:18:41.704 --> 00:18:46.873
So they took me to church and it was that
Greek Orthodox Church, you see,

00:18:47.074 --> 00:18:51.298
and a Black Order, which is supposed to be
the highest. I don’t know how they call it.

00:18:51.499 --> 00:18:57.049
So we went inside and the priest said,
“All right, today I’m sorry,

00:18:57.250 --> 00:19:02.264
we cannot offer you meat because our
fasting is there. But we’ll have lunch.”

00:19:02.464 --> 00:19:04.515
So we had a very sumptuous lunch and
all that.

00:19:04.716 --> 00:19:07.998
But the priest was only busy drinking,
because it was a fasting,

00:19:08.199 --> 00:19:10.569
so drinking is allowed, according to them.

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:12.944
So he was drinking and drinking and
drinking.

00:19:13.144 --> 00:19:16.210
He drank so much that he forgot that
we were there!

00:19:16.411 --> 00:19:20.081
We were supposed to be VIPs, you see:
just lost himself into drinking!

00:19:20.288 --> 00:19:23.583
So we thought better now have an honourable
retreat, you see.

00:19:23.784 --> 00:19:28.139
So we got up and walked out of that place

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:30.101
and this fellow didn’t even come
to wish us.

00:19:30.302 --> 00:19:33.263
And these officers, the Russian officers,
didn’t drink,

00:19:33.464 --> 00:19:35.993
and didn’t do anything, and they were
laughing and laughing.

00:19:36.194 --> 00:19:38.066
He said, “See now, this is Christianity!

00:19:38.267 --> 00:19:41.086
That’s why we didn’t want to take
to Christianity.”

00:19:41.287 --> 00:19:44.238
So I said, “But see, that’s not Christ.”

00:19:44.439 --> 00:19:48.045
They said, “That’s true, but what these
people are saying, is it Christianity?”

00:19:48.246 --> 00:19:49.864
I said, “It’s not.”

00:19:50.064 --> 00:19:54.484
Now this gentleman, you see, was supposed
to be

00:19:54.685 --> 00:19:59.668
the highest person in spirituality living
in Russia!

00:19:59.869 --> 00:20:02.998
So they have told me a story about
the tzars.

00:20:03.199 --> 00:20:06.693
You see, tzars wanted to have some religion
because they thought,

00:20:06.894 --> 00:20:11.101
“Everybody’s having a religion, we have
no religion. Must have some religion.”

00:20:11.302 --> 00:20:15.430
So they sent for some people

00:20:15.631 --> 00:20:18.903
and the people who came forward were
Catholics to begin with.

00:20:19.104 --> 00:20:24.431
So the Catholics said, “All right, you can
drink in Catholic religion.”

00:20:24.632 --> 00:20:27.244
I don’t know how they got this idea, but
it’s all right.

00:20:27.445 --> 00:20:33.512
“Catholic religion you can drink but you
cannot have more than one wife.”

00:20:33.713 --> 00:20:35.735
The tzar said, “No, that’s not possible!

00:20:35.936 --> 00:20:38.834
We have to have many tsarinas, you see,
for different purposes.

00:20:39.035 --> 00:20:43.073
So we can’t have that religion!”
So they cancelled it.

00:20:43.274 --> 00:20:47.303
So then the Islam: you see that time
I think they were no hindus available,

00:20:47.504 --> 00:20:49.966
thank God!

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:54.425
They had the Islam, Islam people went,
and the Islamic people said,

00:20:54.626 --> 00:20:58.840
“No, all right, you can have five wives,
it’s all right,

00:20:59.041 --> 00:21:05.238
but you cannot drink.” They said,
“That’s impossible!

00:21:05.439 --> 00:21:10.235
How can we follow Islam? That’s not
possible!” So, cancel it!

00:21:10.436 --> 00:21:13.285
So these orthodox people — orthodox,
you see,

00:21:13.486 --> 00:21:15.892
the word orthodox remember that — they
came.

00:21:16.093 --> 00:21:18.892
They said, “No, we are just in the centre,
you see.

00:21:19.093 --> 00:21:22.332
We don’t mind if you drink,

00:21:22.533 --> 00:21:25.314
we don’t mind if you have many wives,
we don’t mind.

00:21:25.536 --> 00:21:28.188
Only thing is, you have to pay us well!”

00:21:28.389 --> 00:21:32.702
Tzars said, “All right, that’s good, let’s
have this religion!”

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:36.450
And that’s how they had this religion
there.

00:21:36.651 --> 00:21:39.382
So this is the situation of the religion
today.

00:21:39.583 --> 00:21:48.663
All these religions have become sort
of deformed statues, good for nothing.

00:21:48.864 --> 00:21:52.747
So now the inner religion within us is
the Sahaja dharma,

00:21:52.948 --> 00:21:56.941
which has to be fully followed.

00:21:57.142 --> 00:22:01.858
Now, I told, say in India, that now you
are all become Sahajas.

00:22:02.059 --> 00:22:09.250
The story is like this, that there was
a villager who became Christian.

00:22:09.451 --> 00:22:13.966
So he came down to Allahabad to become
Christian.

00:22:14.167 --> 00:22:16.147
So he told them that, “You have to give
me a big name

00:22:16.348 --> 00:22:19.533
because now I am Saheb, you see, I have
become an English man.

00:22:19.734 --> 00:22:22.229
So you better give me a big name.”
They said, “What name you want?”

00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:24.938
He said, “Give me the name of Alexander
the Great!”

00:22:25.139 --> 00:22:28.946
So they called him Alexander. But his name
was Blondie, you see.

00:22:29.147 --> 00:22:35.114
His real Indian name was Bhoora, so they
called him Alexander Bhoora.

00:22:35.314 --> 00:22:38.300
So Mr. Alexander Bhoora came to Allahabad

00:22:38.501 --> 00:22:41.498
and went to the River Ganges for having
his bath.

00:22:41.699 --> 00:22:45.706
So the priest said, the pastor, he said,
“You can’t do that!”

00:22:45.907 --> 00:22:48.172
He said, “Why? Why can’t I do that?”

00:22:48.373 --> 00:22:50.961
He said, “No, you can’t go and have bath
in the River Ganges

00:22:51.162 --> 00:22:53.110
because the Christianity will drop out,
you see!”

00:22:53.311 --> 00:22:56.296
If he goes and has a bath in the River
Ganges.

00:22:56.497 --> 00:22:58.339
He said, “This you can’t do!”

00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:02.719
So Alexander Bhoora said, “If I have become
saheb,

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:07.041
I have become an Englishman, that doesn’t
mean I have given up my religion!”

00:23:07.242 --> 00:23:12.120
You see! This is exactly what is happening
to us

00:23:12.321 --> 00:23:15.873
when we try to follow any religion
whatsoever.

00:23:16.074 --> 00:23:21.791
Now we are all identified with our
so-called religions in which we were born.

00:23:21.992 --> 00:23:26.511
For example, if I told Indians, “Now,
you don’t go to temples!

00:23:26.712 --> 00:23:30.651
You are not to go to any temple, even if it
is a swayambhu temple,

00:23:30.852 --> 00:23:35.313
unless and until you have told me, don’t go
to a swayambhu temple at any cost.”

00:23:35.514 --> 00:23:42.842
There are many churches also where there
are very good statues, we can say,

00:23:43.043 --> 00:23:48.240
or have got something which are really
swayambhus, but they are very few.

00:23:48.441 --> 00:23:51.521
So you tell me and then go. But they
wouldn’t listen to me,

00:23:51.722 --> 00:23:56.562
they won’t listen, and when they go there
they catch on their Agnyas.

00:23:56.784 --> 00:24:02.466
Once I went to see one temple which was
of course a swayambhu temple, no doubt,

00:24:02.667 --> 00:24:06.506
so some Sahaj Yogis decided to go there.

00:24:06.707 --> 00:24:08.914
But I didn’t ask them, they didn’t tell
me.

00:24:09.114 --> 00:24:11.753
When they came back, as soon as they
saw me, they all fainted.

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:16.692
I said, “What happened? Where did you go?”
“Oh, we went to this temple.”

00:24:16.893 --> 00:24:20.067
I said, “Why? You never told me. And what
do you have here?”

00:24:20.268 --> 00:24:23.580
You see, the Brahmin put the teeka
(bindi) and it’s finished!

00:24:23.781 --> 00:24:26.329
Then it took them one month to clear out!

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:31.164
Now they don’t go, they’ve had enough
of it.

00:24:31.365 --> 00:24:34.853
Same with the Christians:

00:24:35.054 --> 00:24:38.360
now the other day I heard about the Paris
episode

00:24:38.561 --> 00:24:45.703
where people wanted to have weddings
in the church, in Paris.

00:24:45.904 --> 00:24:47.907
So they must have special dresses!

00:24:48.108 --> 00:24:53.293
So somebody came here to buy some special
dresses from… what shop is that?

00:24:53.494 --> 00:24:55.709
I forgot the name, some big name.

00:24:55.910 --> 00:25:02.258
So the special dresses must be worn because
they have to go to the church!

00:25:02.459 --> 00:25:08.119
And when they came out of the church with
those dresses, they had become bhoots.

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:11.841
I was surprised, what has happened to these
twenty-five of them?

00:25:12.042 --> 00:25:16.612
What has happened is that in the church
there are many dead bodies buried,

00:25:16.813 --> 00:25:18.752
and they are all caught up.

00:25:18.953 --> 00:25:23.740
So when you go also to see the beautiful
architecture,

00:25:23.941 --> 00:25:29.902
go with a detached mind. Don’t think
that you belong to that church.

00:25:30.103 --> 00:25:33.161
You don’t belong to any church. You don’t
belong to any temple.

00:25:33.362 --> 00:25:37.873
Don’t belong to any one of these forms,
then only you will ascend.

00:25:38.074 --> 00:25:44.692
And I have to tell you today that Christ
did not belong to any religion.

00:25:47.015 --> 00:25:53.610
He didn’t follow any religion. He followed
His own spiritual religion.

00:25:53.811 --> 00:25:56.778
When He went to one church where there
were people who were discussing,

00:25:56.979 --> 00:26:01.915
I mean they were Jews, He went there
and He was talking to them.

00:26:02.116 --> 00:26:06.716
The other day I saw a beautiful painting
they had given on the newspaper,

00:26:06.917 --> 00:26:11.730
a very beautiful famous painting where
Christ is talking to the doctors

00:26:11.931 --> 00:26:20.876
and He is holding His, rubbing His Left
Swadhishthana, very nicely,

00:26:21.077 --> 00:26:24.113
and all the doctors, you see, one of them
is listening to Him,

00:26:24.314 --> 00:26:26.607
one of them is looking at Him, sneering
at Him,

00:26:26.808 --> 00:26:29.002
another one is little bit paying attention
to Him.

00:26:29.203 --> 00:26:34.013
He’s just rubbing His Left Swadhishthan.

00:26:34.364 --> 00:26:37.391
It’s clearly [shown]. You can see it
so clearly!

00:26:37.592 --> 00:26:41.825
And so now, with these new achievements,
you must rise above all these things

00:26:42.026 --> 00:26:47.709
and you must understand that we have to be
very independently looking at ourselves.

00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:51.848
We are no more belonging to any religion.

00:26:52.049 --> 00:26:57.513
We belong to the religion of God which is
Sahaj.

00:26:57.714 --> 00:27:00.818
And Sahaj is the religion, it will spread

00:27:01.019 --> 00:27:05.354
only when you really become nothing
but Sahaj.

00:27:05.555 --> 00:27:09.088
But that’s something I don’t understand —
it doesn’t work out.

00:27:09.289 --> 00:27:14.764
I met somebody from, I forget that, there
was, say, called

00:27:14.965 --> 00:27:21.683
‘Hamaty’ or something who was supposed
to be an incarnation or something.

00:27:21.884 --> 00:27:26.419
His disciples absolutely, you should say
that they behave in such a manner

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:32.652
that you can’t believe it, how ardently
they believe in this man.

00:27:32.853 --> 00:27:37.248
Whatever he says, whatever he does,
how they believe in him.

00:27:37.449 --> 00:27:39.271
It’s very surprising.

00:27:39.472 --> 00:27:45.590
You meet anyone who is following any guru,
anyone,

00:27:45.791 --> 00:27:49.931
you’ll be surprised the way they are
fanatic about this fellow

00:27:50.132 --> 00:27:53.348
and they will not hear anything against.
Leave alone that,

00:27:53.549 --> 00:27:58.754
but if he says, “You stand on your head
for the whole night,” they will do it!

00:27:58.976 --> 00:28:03.547
I don’t know what happens: when it comes
to falsehood, we try to follow it,

00:28:03.748 --> 00:28:07.433
and when we know the truth, this is
the truth,

00:28:07.634 --> 00:28:13.552
then we take advantage and we try
to compromise.

00:28:13.753 --> 00:28:19.698
We think the truth will not do anything
about it.

00:28:19.919 --> 00:28:22.826
Not that truth will punish you, it will
not,

00:28:23.027 --> 00:28:26.273
because you are realised souls. It will
not.

00:28:26.474 --> 00:28:29.660
It will not punish you up to a point.

00:28:29.861 --> 00:28:37.166
But remember that Ekadasha is absolutely
working at the same time.

00:28:37.367 --> 00:28:39.304
If we do anything wrong,

00:28:39.505 --> 00:28:43.943
like these people went to the church,
they were all caught up.

00:28:44.356 --> 00:28:47.707
Now they may say that, “Mother, why should
we be caught up?

00:28:47.908 --> 00:28:50.714
We are Sahaj Yogis.”

00:28:50.915 --> 00:28:56.328
Because you are vulnerable, you are
vulnerable.

00:28:56.529 --> 00:28:58.704
Yet you have not reached that stage.

00:28:58.905 --> 00:29:01.891
If you reach that stage, then when you
go there,

00:29:02.092 --> 00:29:06.863
all the church people will come out
of the church and run away.

00:29:07.064 --> 00:29:10.405
They’ll start shaking before you.

00:29:10.606 --> 00:29:12.274
They will not know what has happened.

00:29:12.475 --> 00:29:15.118
I have seen when I enter into any church

00:29:15.319 --> 00:29:18.478
all the candles start going chuk, chuk,
chuk, chuk, chuk, chuk,

00:29:18.679 --> 00:29:21.205
and people start wondering what has
happened.

00:29:21.406 --> 00:29:25.712
Even when they are having a dinner or
something and there is a candlelight dinner

00:29:25.913 --> 00:29:31.541
I am surprised the way every candle starts
flickering and people start looking.

00:29:31.742 --> 00:29:34.315
Because the bhoots are sitting before them,
you see,

00:29:34.516 --> 00:29:39.494
so the candles immediately show that
these are the bhoots sitting here.

00:29:39.695 --> 00:29:44.249
With all this knowledge that you have,
the light you have within yourself,

00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:46.981
by which you are enlightened, still if you
are going

00:29:47.182 --> 00:29:51.698
to these left and right-sided things,
it’s very, very dangerous.

00:29:51.899 --> 00:29:58.853
We see that also, today, I must tell you
about the part that is politics.

00:29:59.054 --> 00:30:02.410
In politics also these people have
developed two types of theories:

00:30:02.611 --> 00:30:04.782
one is left-sided, one right-sided.

00:30:04.983 --> 00:30:07.944
The left-sided theories are democratic,

00:30:08.145 --> 00:30:11.004
where you can indulge into anything
you like.

00:30:11.205 --> 00:30:13.434
It’s the individual that is important.

00:30:13.643 --> 00:30:15.993
The individual indulges into everything

00:30:16.194 --> 00:30:20.425
and you should not stop him from doing
whatever he likes, he’s an individual:

00:30:20.626 --> 00:30:23.595
so he has a right to cut his nose, he has
a right to cut his eyes,

00:30:23.796 --> 00:30:26.765
to do what he likes.

00:30:26.966 --> 00:30:30.706
An individual is allowed to do what
he likes to do,

00:30:30.907 --> 00:30:37.488
and then what happens [is] that we find
this democracy becomes a demonocracy:

00:30:37.689 --> 00:30:42.423
everybody is a demon. Everybody is busy
cutting throats,

00:30:42.624 --> 00:30:48.148
cutting all the basis and the roots of life

00:30:48.349 --> 00:30:52.311
because everybody is Brahma, becomes
a great personality,

00:30:52.512 --> 00:30:57.933
because the individual is so great and
the collective is lost, completely lost.

00:30:58.134 --> 00:31:02.877
But on the other side, where it is more
discipline,

00:31:03.078 --> 00:31:08.080
more aggressiveness, more controls and
everything [with] the Right Side,

00:31:08.281 --> 00:31:13.180
which we can call as communism, where
people are controlled all the time.

00:31:13.381 --> 00:31:18.121
Now why? Because for the collective
the individual must sacrifice.

00:31:18.322 --> 00:31:22.908
In that case, the individuals become weak
and if the individuals are weak,

00:31:23.109 --> 00:31:27.448
then the collective cannot be strong:
it cannot be strong.

00:31:27.649 --> 00:31:30.634
The individuals have to be strong.
For example, you will see

00:31:30.835 --> 00:31:34.763
that the people who come from communist
countries,

00:31:34.964 --> 00:31:38.803
they drink more than people who can
drink here.

00:31:39.004 --> 00:31:43.397
Or those who come, say from Islamic
countries, where they don’t touch anything,

00:31:43.598 --> 00:31:46.492
can drink more than even sardarjees.

00:31:46.693 --> 00:31:51.208
So you can imagine what is the situation
of human beings is

00:31:51.409 --> 00:31:56.510
that, out of fear if you try to control
him, he goes to the Right Side.

00:31:56.711 --> 00:32:00.897
But he is in no way perfected, he’s not
transformed,

00:32:01.098 --> 00:32:06.823
he doesn’t accept the situation, he doesn’t
become that,

00:32:07.024 --> 00:32:11.432
he doesn’t have that power to control
himself.

00:32:11.633 --> 00:32:18.441
He doesn’t get over his sinning aptitudes.
He’s still there.

00:32:18.642 --> 00:32:22.992
As soon as he gets a chance he falls
into it. So that fails.

00:32:23.193 --> 00:32:25.643
So the individuals are weak in that case.

00:32:25.844 --> 00:32:29.698
And where there is complete abandonment,
do what you like,

00:32:29.899 --> 00:32:35.633
live the way you like, indulgences, all
kinds of things, so you find [decadence].

00:32:35.834 --> 00:32:38.016
I mean, everyday you see and you say,

00:32:38.217 --> 00:32:41.383
“Oh God, this is a decadent society,
this is happening!”

00:32:41.584 --> 00:32:46.870
Decadence is because an individual
[to] whom you have given all these powers,

00:32:47.071 --> 00:32:49.955
has no power to bear them.

00:32:50.156 --> 00:32:55.907
An individual cannot bear money. He
cannot bear power of any kind.

00:32:56.108 --> 00:33:01.985
He cannot bear love. He cannot bear
kindness.

00:33:02.186 --> 00:33:08.405
He cannot understand peace because he’s
still an individual.

00:33:08.606 --> 00:33:13.276
But when an individual becomes
the collective -

00:33:13.477 --> 00:33:16.723
this is the ascent through the central
path -

00:33:16.924 --> 00:33:25.709
when he becomes the collective, in his
strength he strengthens the collective.

00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:31.987
And also the collective looks after,
protects, and guides the individual.

00:33:32.188 --> 00:33:33.901
This is what Sahaj Yoga is.

00:33:34.102 --> 00:33:41.177
So the politics of Sahaj Yoga is that you
have to become the collective personality.

00:33:41.426 --> 00:33:48.035
And there where we feel that still we are
something great,

00:33:48.236 --> 00:33:56.520
we are different, we are Indians or we are
from England or from France,

00:33:56.721 --> 00:34:00.309
still if you are identified then you are
not collective.

00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:06.094
In collective sense we are all one, part
and parcel of one being.

00:34:06.295 --> 00:34:10.689
Then you are really acting as collective
being

00:34:10.903 --> 00:34:13.933
and you are one with the Divine. Where
the Sun is looking after you,

00:34:14.134 --> 00:34:17.430
the Moon is looking after you, the winds
are looking after you;

00:34:17.631 --> 00:34:24.112
all the Mother Earth and all these
elements are working.

00:34:24.313 --> 00:34:29.494
Ether, everything is working for you and
you are so well-protected

00:34:29.695 --> 00:34:36.514
and blessed by the special quality to enjoy
the joy.

00:34:36.715 --> 00:34:39.820
Then you really become sensitive to that
joy,

00:34:40.021 --> 00:34:42.942
when you are one with the whole.

00:34:43.143 --> 00:34:47.793
Like if supposing this finger or this
finger is not one with the whole,

00:34:47.994 --> 00:34:52.100
is numbed out… as it happens in leprosy,
what happens

00:34:52.301 --> 00:34:54.503
that this finger becomes numbed out.

00:34:54.704 --> 00:35:00.484
Even if a rat eats it off we don’t know

00:35:00.685 --> 00:35:05.919
because there is no connection, no nerves
acting, it’s insensitive.

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:09.947
In the same way if you are not collective

00:35:10.148 --> 00:35:17.255
and not bothered about collective you are
going to be dropped out.

00:35:17.456 --> 00:35:21.222
You are not going to be there to enjoy

00:35:21.423 --> 00:35:27.083
the beauties of your own glory and that
of the collective.

00:35:27.284 --> 00:35:31.117
So one has to understand that we have to be
strong ourselves,

00:35:31.323 --> 00:35:35.036
we have to ascend and we have to be
collective.

00:35:35.237 --> 00:35:38.527
It’s very easy to find out faults with
others.

00:35:38.728 --> 00:35:41.829
Very easy to find faults with the leaders.

00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:47.096
Very easy to find faults also with Sahaj
Yoga, sometimes with me.

00:35:47.297 --> 00:35:52.491
Better find faults with yourself. The rest
I’ll look after.

00:35:52.692 --> 00:35:57.188
First you just find faults with yourself
and try to understand others

00:35:57.389 --> 00:36:02.422
and love others and enjoy the company
of others.

00:36:02.623 --> 00:36:06.254
This, once you decide that we have
to enjoy,

00:36:06.455 --> 00:36:09.939
I tell you, it’s so spontaneous.

00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:13.777
Just this decision, this faith, within you

00:36:13.978 --> 00:36:17.549
that, “I’m going to enjoy now my Spirit.

00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:21.653
I’m going to enjoy the collective within
me,” that’s the Spirit.

00:36:21.854 --> 00:36:27.513
Just this decision itself will give you
the power to enjoy.

00:36:27.714 --> 00:36:31.256
But the decision should be firm,
no hypocrisy,

00:36:31.457 --> 00:36:35.332
no playing games, no ego, no conditioning,
nothing,

00:36:35.533 --> 00:36:41.441
just pure desire within us that we have
to be the Spirit.

00:36:41.642 --> 00:36:45.858
And the Spirit which is the collective
being within us.

00:36:46.059 --> 00:36:50.831
I hope today on this day of resurrection,

00:36:51.032 --> 00:36:57.756
we have to be thankful to Christ very much
for showing us the way

00:36:57.957 --> 00:37:08.935
and also we have to be very much concerned
and alerted about ourselves:

00:37:09.136 --> 00:37:11.953
Where are we? Where do we stand?

00:37:12.154 --> 00:37:15.514
What are we up to? What are we doing?

00:37:15.715 --> 00:37:19.455
What is our responsibility? What is
expected of us?

00:37:19.656 --> 00:37:22.545
Why all these blessings are given to us?

00:37:22.746 --> 00:37:26.489
There’s no sacrifice in Sahaj Yoga,
no sacrifice.

00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:31.531
Nobody wants you anything to commit
or to do

00:37:31.732 --> 00:37:34.838
or membership or anything like that.

00:37:35.039 --> 00:37:40.484
I think it’s my commitment. As I said,
that God has the commitment

00:37:40.685 --> 00:37:47.872
but you also have one commitment that
your desire should be pure.

00:37:48.073 --> 00:37:51.934
That’s the only thing, that, “Let my desire
be pure!

00:37:52.135 --> 00:37:55.389
No impurities of any kind, should work it
out.”

00:37:55.590 --> 00:38:00.108
As Christ had His desire, so pure, and
that’s what He achieved.

00:38:00.309 --> 00:38:03.430
I am sure you can all achieve a lot in your
life.

00:38:03.631 --> 00:38:08.339
Today is my sixty-fifth birthday. Now
imagine, I’m sixty-five years of age

00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:16.692
and at this age most of the ladies, you
see, just, I don’t know what they do.

00:38:17.987 --> 00:38:26.518
So now you must come up and work out
everything

00:38:26.719 --> 00:38:32.444
as far as possible, thinking that we all
have to stand up.

00:38:32.645 --> 00:38:36.893
Now the children are coming up. They are
also going to stand up.

00:38:37.094 --> 00:38:39.365
You are all looking younger to me and
younger to me.

00:38:39.566 --> 00:38:42.866
Every day I see you, you look younger.
Sometimes I don’t even recognise you,

00:38:43.067 --> 00:38:48.964
the way you look younger and I think,
is he the son or is he the father?

00:38:52.810 --> 00:38:59.436
So, the situation is such that you are
all blessed:

00:38:59.666 --> 00:39:02.905
you’ve got jobs, you’ve got everything.
And everybody tells me,

00:39:03.106 --> 00:39:05.471
“Mother, this is what has happened,
that has happened!” everything.

00:39:05.672 --> 00:39:10.603
Now, so what? These are temptations,
be careful.

00:39:10.804 --> 00:39:12.893
This is not what you wanted.

00:39:13.094 --> 00:39:19.949
What you wanted is the state of that
complete faith within yourself

00:39:20.155 --> 00:39:25.265
where you don’t have to ask, nothing —
everything will work out.

00:39:25.504 --> 00:39:30.806
Everything will work out. It works!
That’s the point is.

00:39:31.007 --> 00:39:34.970
So, I hope next time when we meet

00:39:35.171 --> 00:39:39.634
I’ll see even younger people than what
I see today

00:39:39.835 --> 00:39:42.672
and I’ll be able to recognise you.

00:39:42.873 --> 00:39:45.882
Christ died at a very, very young age, very
young age.

00:39:46.083 --> 00:39:53.865
He was very young, I must say. But how
much He has done for humanity.

00:39:54.066 --> 00:39:58.078
Nobody could have achieved that much
in that small age as He has done it.

00:39:58.279 --> 00:40:01.206
It’s remarkable! It’s really remarkable!

00:40:01.407 --> 00:40:06.235
That’s what I expect you to follow, His
footsteps in doing remarkable things.

00:40:06.436 --> 00:40:11.224
And let me see all of you, every one of you
have to do something great.

00:40:11.425 --> 00:40:14.052
And today is the day of certain promises.

00:40:14.253 --> 00:40:15.760
May God bless you for that.

00:40:15.961 --> 00:40:21.171
And I thank you very much for this birthday
of mine.
