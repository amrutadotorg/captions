WEBVTT

00:01.405 --> 00:09.617
Today we are going to celebrate the birth
of Jesus Christ.

00:18.950 --> 00:30.010
He came on this earth in a very special
way, that He was born to a Virgin.

00:31.318 --> 00:36.612
And we can understand

00:38.979 --> 00:48.657
as you know as Shri Ganesha was also born
in the same way,

00:48.858 --> 00:58.111
and as Jesus is an incarnation
of Shri Ganesha,

01:00.256 --> 01:06.035
He had all His powers when He was born,

01:06.236 --> 01:15.893
He did not have to bring any outward
weapons to show that what powers He had.

01:16.094 --> 01:20.443
But He had all the powers with Him,

01:20.644 --> 01:26.455
but still He tried to show tolerance and
understanding,

01:26.656 --> 01:33.515
because at that time the people with whom
He had to deal

01:33.716 --> 01:39.134
were absolutely ignorant of spirituality.

01:39.811 --> 01:42.733
They were actually Jews

01:42.934 --> 01:51.294
and they were instructed by Moses, Abraham,
all these people.

01:51.495 --> 01:57.208
But they had lost their moorings, and they
didn’t know what to seek,

01:57.409 --> 02:02.102
how to seek, and they were not seekers.

02:02.303 --> 02:08.538
They are quite satisfied with all the Jewish
ritualism they had

02:08.739 --> 02:14.812
as also in other religions we do the same.

02:15.013 --> 02:21.588
There was no seeking at all for anything
great.

02:22.494 --> 02:31.551
And so He had a very difficult life,
extremely difficult life.

02:33.632 --> 02:37.160
When He was born there was a sign,

02:37.361 --> 02:47.272
of a star which three men saw and they
followed it

02:47.504 --> 02:56.570
and reached that place where they found
that He was born in a manger,

02:56.771 --> 03:05.657
the very simple, simplest possible place
to be born.

03:08.191 --> 03:10.668
Was born in all great difficulties

03:10.869 --> 03:21.987
but it was shown clearly through a star
that He was something great.

03:22.188 --> 03:28.351
The other day somebody was asking Me,
"How did You find Ganapatipule?"

03:29.099 --> 03:35.048
Actually I didn’t know, and in Maharashtra
this is not a very well-known place.

03:35.249 --> 03:38.632
They go to Ashtavinayakas but not to this
Mahaganapati.

03:38.833 --> 03:41.611
They had no idea.

03:42.597 --> 03:46.141
But I was coming back from Ratnagiri

03:46.342 --> 03:53.224
and I saw really a very big star on top
of this temple.

03:53.758 --> 03:56.627
But nobody could see it, that’s
the problem is.

03:56.828 --> 03:59.535
At that time no sahaja yogis could see it.

03:59.736 --> 04:07.015
So I told them, "Let us follow this star."
It was a very big, big one, unusually big,

04:07.216 --> 04:14.985
not like a star, but quite a big, big star,
very unusual.

04:15.186 --> 04:19.562
But they couldn’t see it. Other people who
were with Me

04:19.763 --> 04:23.512
they said that, “We can’t see it.”

04:24.753 --> 04:31.893
I said, “Doesn’t matter.” So I told them
to turn it,

04:32.094 --> 04:39.567
turn it from this Hadkamba they call it,
and let us go on this another road.

04:39.768 --> 04:47.481
And we just followed it. They, of course,
listened to Me, and they did not argue.

04:47.682 --> 04:50.802
And we were travelling, travelling, we were
quite late,

04:51.003 --> 04:55.871
but still I [said], “Doesn’t matter,
it’s alright, let’s go”.

04:56.072 --> 05:00.009
And by the time we reached Ganapatipule,

05:00.210 --> 05:04.397
it was the dawn, beautiful dawn, I can’t
forget that.

05:04.598 --> 05:12.881
And in that dawn we see such a beautiful
place here where we are now.

05:13.082 --> 05:18.211
And I said, “This is the place where we
have to be,

05:18.412 --> 05:23.907
where we have to get all the sahaja
yogis to.”

05:24.108 --> 05:29.032
Of course, you know that Rabindranath
Tagore has already described

05:29.233 --> 05:34.579
about this place that people will come here
from all over the world

05:34.780 --> 05:38.470
and at the shore of Bharat this will be
done.

05:38.671 --> 05:43.770
All these are predicted, have been done
already,

05:44.270 --> 05:50.133
but how miraculously I discovered this
place is very surprising

05:50.334 --> 05:54.988
as those three great men discovered Christ.

05:57.286 --> 06:05.615
And the place was really blessed and was
very beautifully vibrated.

06:06.475 --> 06:13.771
I stayed here for two days and I decided

06:13.972 --> 06:19.167
that this is the place we have to take.

06:19.368 --> 06:25.216
Ultimately we got this land and we got
all these things here.

06:28.518 --> 06:34.656
So many things Christ has said.
On the cross He said, “Behold the Mother”.

06:34.857 --> 06:45.485
Behold, is a very good word, meaning that
look forward, see the Mother.

06:45.819 --> 06:50.504
At the time of His death also He said this.

06:50.705 --> 06:59.303
And all these people are just trying
to create violence, torture,

06:59.504 --> 07:05.359
all kinds of things which cannot be Divine.

07:06.313 --> 07:11.385
So one has to understand that you cannot
spread any religion

07:11.586 --> 07:18.748
with violence, with force, you cannot.
Only with love and compassion.

07:18.949 --> 07:24.015
You can spread Sahaja Yoga only through
love and compassion.

07:24.216 --> 07:29.368
And that compassion is not a mental stuff

07:29.569 --> 07:33.482
that we think we are better than others
so we should change them.

07:33.683 --> 07:40.391
No. It is more love and compassion.

07:40.592 --> 07:44.828
That you feel that we can really resurrect
people,

07:45.052 --> 07:51.954
not trying to change anything, but
to resurrect,

07:52.155 --> 07:55.873
as they are, we will resurrect them.

07:56.074 --> 08:01.522
This is our work: to resurrect people and
to give them the truth.

08:01.723 --> 08:06.035
There are many, many people all over
the world, and you have seen now,

08:06.236 --> 08:11.642
we are working in the 86 countries.
In a place like Benin

08:11.843 --> 08:15.557
we have got seven hundred sahaja yogis,
seven thousand, sorry,

08:15.758 --> 08:20.397
sahaja yogis, who were Muslims.

08:20.598 --> 08:25.166
And I asked them, "How did you take
to Sahaj?"

08:25.367 --> 08:27.891
He said, “Obvious.” I said, “Why?”

08:28.092 --> 08:32.243
I said, “First of all, why did you become
Christians?”

08:32.444 --> 08:38.026
He said, “No, we didn’t. We just became
Muslims.” “But why?”

08:38.227 --> 08:45.797
“Because the French who were ruling there
were extremely immoral people,

08:45.998 --> 08:50.645
very immoral. And we thought, what’s
the use of following their religion,

08:50.846 --> 08:54.903
who drink all the time, and do all kinds
of filth,

08:55.104 --> 09:02.062
so how can we be better off? So we took
to Islam.”

09:02.263 --> 09:08.254
But they are now in Sahaja Yoga because
whatever it is

09:08.455 --> 09:13.900
they have discrimination. They are seekers
and they have discrimination.

09:14.101 --> 09:21.358
Imagine, they are all, we can call them
as people from the black, black people.

09:21.559 --> 09:25.427
But they have such enlightened mind, I was
amazed.

09:25.628 --> 09:30.140
They have made poems on Me, they have made
lots of things about Me,

09:30.341 --> 09:33.333
and seven thousand of them have become,

09:33.542 --> 09:39.068
and they said one day the whole country
will become, sahaja yogis.

09:44.958 --> 09:49.261
In Turkey you know there is Islam,
so-called.

09:49.462 --> 09:54.807
But there was their leader Atatürk Kemal
Pasha, who was an enlightened soul

09:55.008 --> 10:00.297
and he talked to them that all this is
nonsense, this purdah system, this, that,

10:00.498 --> 10:02.857
oppression of women, all is nonsense.

10:03.058 --> 10:08.452
And he really made them much free. They
are extremely creative people there,

10:08.653 --> 10:14.933
and imagine, there are two thousand sahaja
yogis in Turkey.

10:15.126 --> 10:19.468
When there was this earthquake, you’ll be
amazed to know

10:19.669 --> 10:29.081
not one sahaja yogi was killed nor
anybody’s house was destroyed.

10:35.016 --> 10:41.507
In our country also we have four, four
states

10:41.708 --> 10:45.028
which were all converted into Catholicism.

10:45.229 --> 10:48.553
Now I have talked to them, and they said,
“No, these people only told us

10:48.754 --> 10:54.846
how to dress up well, go to church, sing
hymns and come back home.”

10:55.387 --> 11:00.860
I was surprised: they are dressed better,
no doubt, than other people,

11:01.045 --> 11:06.708
but how could they accept such a thing?
Because they are aboriginal,

11:06.909 --> 11:15.288
they are people who are not yet open
to light of the modern times or anything.

11:15.662 --> 11:19.110
And then after that,

11:22.150 --> 11:30.018
after that, they were trying their hands
on Orissa.

11:31.545 --> 11:39.417
In Orissa there were already 35 to 40
persons who were Catholics.

11:40.134 --> 11:45.313
And I asked some sahaja yogis from
Australia

11:45.514 --> 11:49.279
to go and do some work there of Sahaja
Yoga.

11:49.480 --> 11:53.139
And they established nine centers there.

11:53.340 --> 11:56.341
Nine centers of Sahaja Yoga were
established.

11:56.542 --> 12:04.142
But the best part of it, when there was
a huge big destruction

12:04.343 --> 12:09.345
through a hurricane that came,

12:11.292 --> 12:19.300
all the sahaja yogis who have newly
accepted Sahaja Yoga, are all safe.

12:22.016 --> 12:25.881
All their houses are safe.

12:26.082 --> 12:30.417
So now what is going to come is the Last
Judgment.

12:30.618 --> 12:36.368
In that all people who still are trying
fundamentalism,

12:36.569 --> 12:40.611
who are fundamentalist, they’ll be
destroyed, I think so.

12:40.812 --> 12:46.458
Because the way they are destroyed in all
these countries, I just don’t understand

12:46.659 --> 12:50.865
what is happening and why these people are
getting destroyed,

12:51.066 --> 12:56.744
their families destroyed, their houses
destroyed. Is the Kalki I think is acting,

12:56.945 --> 13:03.116
and working it out in all these places
in such a severe manner.

13:06.181 --> 13:10.975
Those people who do black magic and all
that, they were also destroyed.

13:11.152 --> 13:18.609
Is very surprising that in Orissa not one
sahaja yogi was hurt.

13:20.023 --> 13:27.264
It is such a big protection of the Divine
on sahaja yogis,

13:27.465 --> 13:32.029
which was to come, was told long time back
it was going to come.

13:32.230 --> 13:36.669
But people got lost in ritualism,
in the priesthood,

13:36.870 --> 13:41.847
and its all kinds of talks.

13:42.934 --> 13:47.138
By talking you cannot get a spiritual
experience,

13:47.339 --> 13:53.027
by reading you cannot get any spiritual
experience.

13:53.228 --> 13:59.143
Guru Nanaka has said it, Kabira has said it,
even Adi Shankaracharya has said

13:59.344 --> 14:05.784
that this is Shabda Jalam, this is the web
of words. “Oh Mother, take me out of that”.

14:05.985 --> 14:11.115
All these people who knew the truth have
said the same thing,

14:11.316 --> 14:16.097
they have repeated the same thing, if you
read their lives you’ll be surprised.

14:16.298 --> 14:23.445
Even the Sufis who were Muslims have
written the same thing all over.

14:23.646 --> 14:28.488
It’s surprising, how can Sufis living
in Turkey

14:28.689 --> 14:34.802
or living in, even they were in Pakistan –

14:35.003 --> 14:38.850
now is Pakistan, that time it was India –

14:39.051 --> 14:44.968
they all have written the same thing, some
great poets even from England

14:45.169 --> 14:53.379
have written the same thing, that truth
is truth, and truth is love.

14:53.580 --> 14:56.790
That’s what Christ wanted to establish,

14:56.991 --> 15:01.826
but He was born in a very, very difficult
situation.

15:02.027 --> 15:07.468
And the people who took over, as priests
and Church and all that,

15:07.669 --> 15:14.712
made full advantage of that and have really
oppressed all the people.

15:14.992 --> 15:21.014
There’s no oppression in Sahaja Yoga.
It’s your free will by which you come in.

15:21.215 --> 15:28.084
And you have to find the truth, truth about
yourself, you should know yourself.

15:28.285 --> 15:31.889
All the time Christ has said, “Know
Thyself.”

15:32.090 --> 15:35.077
And they don’t try that at all anywhere,
Knowing Thyself,

15:35.278 --> 15:38.753
because they don’t know themselves.

15:40.652 --> 15:47.011
This situation we have in every religion.

15:47.212 --> 15:54.723
They all came to fight it, to tell us
what is the right path what to follow.

15:54.924 --> 15:58.085
What Christ did was a very remarkable
thing,

15:58.286 --> 16:05.523
that He told the Jews that He is the Light,
He is the Path.

16:05.729 --> 16:09.127
But He didn’t say He was the destination,
clearly,

16:09.328 --> 16:13.815
because He knew that somebody has to come,

16:14.016 --> 16:18.684
and He said the Holy Ghost will come,

16:18.885 --> 16:22.164
and She’ll have three things as you know:

16:22.365 --> 16:28.887
that She’ll be a Comforter, She’ll be
a Counselor, and She’ll be a Redeemer.

16:29.088 --> 16:35.962
He didn’t use She or He, but in Hebrew
language it says “It”.

16:36.594 --> 16:41.749
So people have misused Bible to such
an extent that in England

16:41.950 --> 16:47.332
a king wanted to divorce his wife so he
authorized the Bible.

16:47.533 --> 16:53.829
How can such an adharmic fellow authorize
such a holy book like Bible?

16:54.065 --> 16:59.776
Because the power: with the power he want
to control,

16:59.976 --> 17:05.259
want to control all that is reality.

17:05.460 --> 17:08.049
This is a blind power.

17:08.250 --> 17:13.905
But if you have a real power, then you know
what to respect, what not to respect.

17:14.106 --> 17:16.245
Which way to go, which way not to go.

17:16.446 --> 17:24.300
Because you have a sight, you know a very
bright understanding of the whole thing.

17:24.501 --> 17:31.811
Which road you have to follow, where you
have to go, and which is the right thing.

17:32.012 --> 17:37.525
Thank God through this Kali Yuga, because
of all kinds of horrible things,

17:37.726 --> 17:43.093
as also among Hindus lots of funny, funny
rituals they have,

17:43.294 --> 17:50.082
that people have seen through that this is
not the end of it.

17:50.283 --> 17:53.825
You have to seek, you have to seek.

17:54.042 --> 17:59.858
But the only thing which is very important
is that all of them have said

18:00.059 --> 18:04.384
that you have to seek, you have to find out
your Self.

18:04.585 --> 18:09.502
Which is very clearly written in some
of the Indian scriptures.

18:09.703 --> 18:12.600
Some of them, I would say not all of them.

18:12.801 --> 18:16.001
Some of them it is written that you must
seek your Self,

18:16.202 --> 18:20.997
specially the saints who came on this earth
in India,

18:21.198 --> 18:27.391
they have tried to say all the time that
you must seek,

18:27.592 --> 18:31.059
you must find out the truth. Because they
knew the truth

18:31.260 --> 18:34.258
and they wanted others to find the truth.

18:34.459 --> 18:38.339
So in every religion there have been
enlightened people.

18:38.540 --> 18:45.305
Among Buddhists also there has been
a Viditama, Lao-Tse, and many others,

18:45.506 --> 18:50.945
who have talked about seeking, seeking
the truth.

18:51.147 --> 18:55.311
Christ has said it very clearly, very, very
clearly,

18:55.512 --> 19:02.497
and at His birthday I feel very happy that
so many of you

19:02.698 --> 19:06.473
have already found out the truth and that
you know

19:06.674 --> 19:11.191
the path of love and compassion and
humility.

19:11.392 --> 19:16.236
As it is we know where Christ resides
within us,

19:16.437 --> 19:20.683
and how to respect Christ, and how
to worship it.

19:20.884 --> 19:24.453
With this Agnya chakra you can make out
a person

19:24.654 --> 19:33.300
whether he is a seeker or he is
a dominating arrogant Christian.

19:34.374 --> 19:38.024
You cannot do that, if you are a Christian
you cannot be that.

19:38.225 --> 19:40.876
If you are that, then you are not
a Christian.

19:41.077 --> 19:43.729
Look at Christ, how humble He was.

19:43.930 --> 19:48.688
He could have finished them off - He had
such powers - all of them;

19:48.889 --> 19:56.588
but He got Himself crucified. The reason
was Agnya chakra was to be broken.

19:56.789 --> 20:00.350
Was to be crossed. And so He accepted.

20:00.551 --> 20:03.650
As I told you He had all the powers
of Shri Ganesha,

20:03.851 --> 20:10.693
which are the most destructive powers.

20:10.894 --> 20:15.500
All these powers come from Mother Earth,

20:15.701 --> 20:20.044
and the Mother Earth can shake the whole
world.

20:20.245 --> 20:24.557
But He was the One who came as Mahavishnu,

20:24.745 --> 20:29.782
as described in the Devi Mahatmya. What
a person He was,

20:29.983 --> 20:34.584
and what He did, all His work is
beautifully described in Mahavishnu.

20:34.991 --> 20:42.231
Now I would tell you this, that if Christ
is born and He came on this earth,

20:42.432 --> 20:45.059
it’s a very, very great occasion.

20:45.260 --> 20:48.378
He gave His life for us, He did everything.

20:48.579 --> 20:53.159
And how are we following Him is
by forgiving.

20:53.360 --> 20:59.102
You have to forgive others, you forgive
yourself and you forgive others.

20:59.303 --> 21:03.400
Is very important if you want to open this
Agnya chakra,

21:03.601 --> 21:08.112
where resides our Lord Jesus Christ.

21:08.313 --> 21:11.624
If you cannot forgive others

21:11.825 --> 21:16.801
and you cannot forgive yourself, then this
Agnya won’t open.

21:17.002 --> 21:21.656
And the best part of it, all the Christian
nations I have seen,

21:21.865 --> 21:27.720
where there are so-called Christians, they
all have a very bad Agnya.

21:27.921 --> 21:33.559
If they are really following Christ, why
should there be a catch on the Agnya chakra?

21:33.760 --> 21:41.078
And they are extremely dominating, arrogant
people.

21:41.437 --> 21:47.266
They cannot be the disciples of Christ.
He was so humble,

21:47.467 --> 21:55.203
He was so much one with God Almighty, that
He accepted His crucifixion.

21:55.404 --> 22:00.401
His birth itself is a very great miracle,

22:00.602 --> 22:03.638
and His work is even greater.

22:03.839 --> 22:10.051
We have to win over all the Christians and
tell them what is real Christianity,

22:10.252 --> 22:13.892
what is reality, and what they should
take to,

22:14.093 --> 22:19.244
and how they should justify their following
of Christ.

22:19.445 --> 22:26.237
It is very big organizational thing, and
it’s a big, I mean, political thing,

22:26.438 --> 22:32.495
I mean, all kinds of things are going on.
And all the bad things they have

22:32.696 --> 22:37.019
from, say Hindu religion, they carry on.

22:37.242 --> 22:40.992
So what is the use of conversion also?

22:41.193 --> 22:48.507
So from His life we have to learn that
He took a birth

22:48.794 --> 22:56.047
in such a situation that nobody would have
dared to be born like that.

22:56.248 --> 23:01.871
So much of darkness and ignorance, so much
of cruelty,

23:02.072 --> 23:07.043
that He took His birth at that time is
extremely remarkable.

23:07.244 --> 23:10.871
Such a brave, courageous personality.

23:11.095 --> 23:14.575
Nowadays they make Christ look like
a TB patient, I mean,

23:14.776 --> 23:21.580
just to beg, you know. Because they are
beggars. All the time they are begging.

23:21.781 --> 23:28.294
And I was in Bombay this time, some little,
little girls and boys were singing songs

23:28.495 --> 23:32.388
and they came up, and they said, “Give us
some money.”

23:32.589 --> 23:35.145
I said, “What are you doing?”
“We are singing carols.”

23:35.346 --> 23:38.322
“So you sing! Why do you need money for?”

23:38.523 --> 23:43.477
“You know, we need money, we have no food
to eat.” Imagine.

23:43.678 --> 23:49.056
Then why sing songs of Christ?

23:49.947 --> 23:56.805
All kinds of begging is done. Christ, did
He beg for anything?

23:57.006 --> 24:00.694
Did He want to create beggars on this
earth?

24:00.895 --> 24:06.121
He died, lived with self-respect.

24:06.322 --> 24:11.205
All His qualities are never studied and
people take

24:11.406 --> 24:20.503
to something which is very mundane,
sometimes absolutely degrading, degrading.

24:20.704 --> 24:26.371
He came to give us a very dharmic,

24:26.580 --> 24:31.590
very… I shouldn’t say religious because
that's different meaning,

24:31.791 --> 24:37.726
but I would say a very pious and beautiful
life.

24:37.927 --> 24:41.928
He is the model, He is the model we have
to follow.

24:42.881 --> 24:47.923
After Sahaja Yoga you realize what is
wrong, what is good.

24:48.124 --> 24:55.916
Unless and until you become a sahaja yogi
is difficult to have this discrimination.

24:56.117 --> 24:59.962
That’s how so many people are lost
in the name of Christ,

25:00.163 --> 25:06.618
lost in the destructive forces of their
being.

25:06.819 --> 25:15.461
As it is we call them all the six enemies
that we have.

25:16.200 --> 25:20.427
So today, when we remember His life,

25:22.532 --> 25:30.313
His birth, His work, His greatness,
His sacrifice,

25:30.514 --> 25:35.383
we have to know that we have to follow
His life.

25:35.584 --> 25:38.170
He is our model,

25:38.355 --> 25:45.724
we have to bear lots of things, we have
to be tolerant, we cannot be aggressive,

25:46.919 --> 25:52.416
we cannot be threat to the freedom
of others.

25:52.617 --> 25:55.427
I know there’s some are satanic people,

25:55.628 --> 26:00.438
but we should not be a threat to them.
Our truth will fight.

26:00.639 --> 26:06.123
This is a very, very simple thing we have
to do.

26:06.324 --> 26:11.043
In Sahaja Yoga see, I have seen people have
taken more

26:11.244 --> 26:16.633
to a very moral life, and a moral behavior,

26:16.841 --> 26:22.981
and a whole culture also. Sahaja Yoga
culture

26:23.182 --> 26:30.664
is a very moral culture, very loving
culture, very compassionate culture.

26:30.880 --> 26:37.688
And I am sure Christ within you will be
happy to see you in this manner.

26:37.889 --> 26:40.880
May God bless you.
