1
00:03:17,245 --> 00:03:22,793
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

2
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:44,593
Actually we are all seeking the truth.
So many of us,

3
00:03:44,794 --> 00:03:54,021
but so far, so many couldn't find and they
are lost.

4
00:03:54,222 --> 00:04:00,612
But what is the truth? What is the truth
about yourself?

5
00:04:00,813 --> 00:04:11,033
The truth is that you are not this body,
you are not these emotions

6
00:04:11,234 --> 00:04:18,618
but what are you? You are the spirit.

7
00:04:18,819 --> 00:04:28,183
All the great saints and incarnations have
said that you are the spirit

8
00:04:28,384 --> 00:04:35,944
and what we are trying to find out is our
selfhood.

9
00:04:36,145 --> 00:04:42,796
We are after that research about ourselves.

10
00:04:42,997 --> 00:04:49,733
We've done lots of mistakes also
by misguided people

11
00:04:49,934 --> 00:05:01,092
but I must say that there is a built-in
arrangement within us, every one of you,

12
00:05:01,293 --> 00:05:11,949
which will take you to that selfhood,
which will give you that self-realization.

13
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:21,188
It's very surprising that they have not
talked about Kundalini so far.

14
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:31,513
There is a power within all of you which
is the Kundalini,

15
00:05:31,714 --> 00:05:37,609
which is three and a half coiled energy

16
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:52,392
in your, I should say, behind your
triangular bone, or it is inside it

17
00:05:52,593 --> 00:05:59,035
and is waiting for that moment when it can
be awakened

18
00:05:59,236 --> 00:06:04,562
and it can pass through the different
centers

19
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:10,981
piercing through your fontanel bone area.

20
00:06:11,182 --> 00:06:17,035
And that's how you get your
self-realization,

21
00:06:17,236 --> 00:06:23,973
that you feel cool breeze coming out
of your fontanel bone area.

22
00:06:24,174 --> 00:06:29,288
It's an actualization. It is not My lecture

23
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:35,665
or reading or anything. It's actualization
which has to take place.

24
00:06:35,866 --> 00:06:42,403
If you don't get it, doesn't matter. Next
time you can get it,

25
00:06:42,604 --> 00:06:48,507
but most of them do get it in a collective
way. It's very surprising

26
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:55,196
that it took so much, so many years
for people

27
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:02,888
to come to this state where they are asking
for the real thing.

28
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:08,635
This is your own. This power is your own.

29
00:07:08,836 --> 00:07:13,307
And it is just waiting there to be
awakened.

30
00:07:13,508 --> 00:07:23,062
Any amount of lecturing, any amount
of reading, nothing can help you.

31
00:07:23,263 --> 00:07:32,837
What is needed is just a quiet mind and
it works.

32
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:38,543
It works under every circumstances.
It's very surprising,

33
00:07:38,744 --> 00:07:46,900
this was the time perhaps, was meant to be
this way.

34
00:07:47,745 --> 00:07:52,999
I've been to this country many a times
before also.

35
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,152
First time when I came, I was so surprised

36
00:07:57,353 --> 00:08:03,831
how people were running after falsehood.
So I gave it up.

37
00:08:04,032 --> 00:08:10,635
After nine years I came, thinking that
what's the matter with these people?

38
00:08:10,836 --> 00:08:15,224
Why can't they understand what they have
to achieve? What they have to get?

39
00:08:15,425 --> 00:08:23,616
Whatever is written and said by all
the saints, by all the incarnations.

40
00:08:23,817 --> 00:08:33,432
I couldn't understand why they were
satisfied with all kinds of nonsense.

41
00:08:33,633 --> 00:08:41,943
And somehow they came to America and
prospered here with all their untruth.

42
00:08:42,144 --> 00:08:50,109
It's very sad that we have lost so many
beautiful seekers in their pursuit.

43
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:56,608
Now I have to tell you one thing, simple
thing, that you must know

44
00:08:56,809 --> 00:09:02,237
that you have every right to know yourself,

45
00:09:02,438 --> 00:09:07,007
to become self-realized, every one of you.

46
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:15,125
Nobody can force it and nobody can deny it.

47
00:09:15,326 --> 00:09:23,143
It is your fundamental right by which you
can get your self-realization.

48
00:09:23,344 --> 00:09:27,015
If you are a human being that's sufficient,

49
00:09:27,216 --> 00:09:33,359
whether you belong to America, or to India
or to any other place,

50
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:39,900
everyone has this right, to get your
self-realization.

51
00:09:40,101 --> 00:09:47,447
As a result of self-realization what
happens, that's the point.

52
00:09:47,648 --> 00:09:55,797
Firstly, you start feeling the Divine
vibrations on your fingertips.

53
00:09:55,998 --> 00:10:04,164
Divine vibrations like cool breeze and it
starts flowing through your hands.

54
00:10:04,365 --> 00:10:10,593
You'll be amazed when it first happens, you
start doubting.

55
00:10:10,794 --> 00:10:15,555
I know people who went and closed their
doors and windows,

56
00:10:15,756 --> 00:10:21,183
wanted to test and find out if they had
those cool breeze.

57
00:10:21,384 --> 00:10:34,299
You have it. It's a sign of yourself
emitting these pure vibrations.

58
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:39,134
As a result of that so many other things
can happen.

59
00:10:39,335 --> 00:10:47,329
But the most important thing is that you
become a very peaceful person.

60
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:52,452
You become a very balanced person

61
00:10:52,653 --> 00:11:00,072
and you become that witness about which
all the religions have talked.

62
00:11:00,273 --> 00:11:08,135
You get to the state of that witness. And
once you become the witness,

63
00:11:08,643 --> 00:11:18,453
you see the whole picture, the whole world
in a very different manner.

64
00:11:18,654 --> 00:11:26,789
You become the witness. It's a state
in which, watch everything.

65
00:11:26,989 --> 00:11:36,695
You do not react but you watch and your
presence itself will help people.

66
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:43,498
I know America nowadays is in a very

67
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:51,633
difficult state and people are quite
frightened type.

68
00:11:51,834 --> 00:11:56,310
If they were realized souls they would
never have been.

69
00:11:56,511 --> 00:12:02,339
The power of realization is so great, not
that it enlightens you

70
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:08,463
but it enlightens others, it enlightens
the atmosphere.

71
00:12:08,664 --> 00:12:15,520
So it’s very important that you get your
last breakthrough of your evolution

72
00:12:15,721 --> 00:12:22,068
and get to that state which we call as
self-realization.

73
00:12:22,269 --> 00:12:29,603
It is a entry into the Divine powers

74
00:12:29,804 --> 00:12:37,300
and this spiritual realm of life which is
very, very surprisingly,

75
00:12:37,501 --> 00:12:45,038
very much surprisingly is very difficult
to understand otherwise.

76
00:12:45,239 --> 00:12:51,751
But once you become a realized soul
automatically you know what it is.

77
00:12:51,952 --> 00:12:59,163
You become so sensitive, at the same time
you are so well protected.

78
00:12:59,364 --> 00:13:03,325
You can solve many problems.

79
00:13:03,526 --> 00:13:10,021
You can do so many things which you could
never have been able to do.

80
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:16,306
The reason is, now you have become
empowered by the Divine force.

81
00:13:16,507 --> 00:13:21,501
This is what you all are seeking, nothing
else.

82
00:13:21,702 --> 00:13:28,045
This is what you want, nothing else. And
this is what you should get it.

83
00:13:28,246 --> 00:13:37,308
No use going into blind place and trying

84
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:43,596
to find out something which you do not
know.

85
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:49,539
With this, your health will improve,

86
00:13:50,404 --> 00:13:58,288
your wealth will improve, your temperament
will improve

87
00:13:58,489 --> 00:14:05,041
and you'll become such a compassionate,
such a beautiful person

88
00:14:05,242 --> 00:14:12,357
that people will be amazed how you have
achieved this state.

89
00:14:12,558 --> 00:14:18,214
You become so collective. So very
collective.

90
00:14:18,415 --> 00:14:25,114
I am surprised how this collective
temperament has come into

91
00:14:25,315 --> 00:14:30,652
all the Sahaja yogis, how they work it out.

92
00:14:30,853 --> 00:14:38,503
It's very beautiful and surprisingly you
may belong to any, any country,

93
00:14:38,704 --> 00:14:46,110
far away from each other, where the people
don't know each other

94
00:14:46,311 --> 00:14:50,173
and such love and such understanding.

95
00:14:50,374 --> 00:14:56,500
This is beyond Me sometimes, you see, how
beautifully

96
00:14:56,701 --> 00:15:02,786
they blend together, mix together and learn
from each other.

97
00:15:02,987 --> 00:15:12,199
Such love, such compassion and such power
is then your own, your own.

98
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:19,475
You don't have to pay for it. You don't
have to do anything of the kind;

99
00:15:19,676 --> 00:15:24,622
just you have to get your Kundalini
awakened.

100
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:30,733
which is very, very easy to do and it works
out.

101
00:15:30,934 --> 00:15:37,307
The time has come, I think, for en-mass
awakening, the time has come

102
00:15:37,508 --> 00:15:41,514
and that's why, well we have to work it
out.

103
00:15:41,715 --> 00:15:46,894
It's not something miraculous, I think.

104
00:15:47,095 --> 00:15:53,767
If you see our evolution: from what stage
to what stage to what stage.

105
00:15:53,968 --> 00:15:59,937
Now at a human stage what do we have
to achieve?

106
00:16:00,138 --> 00:16:07,395
Why are we human beings? What is the part
we have to play?

107
00:16:07,596 --> 00:16:11,306
Because you are a spiritual personality.

108
00:16:11,507 --> 00:16:15,312
You have to become that spiritual
personality.

109
00:16:15,513 --> 00:16:23,212
It's not by reading books or doing all
kinds of rituals that you will achieve it.

110
00:16:23,412 --> 00:16:29,591
It’s just within yourself where
the Kundalini rises,

111
00:16:29,792 --> 00:16:34,698
passes through these various centers and
gets you connected

112
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:40,956
to the Divine power which is all pervading,
which is everywhere.

113
00:16:41,157 --> 00:16:47,969
Then you can learn what is this, how it
works, how it helps you,

114
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:53,074
how it educates you, and how it gives you
knowledge.

115
00:16:53,275 --> 00:16:58,887
It's really remarkable and it works
in every country.

116
00:16:59,095 --> 00:17:05,440
It's very surprising that people told me
that in America it will never work.

117
00:17:05,641 --> 00:17:13,455
I said, "Why?" "Because they are only after
gurus

118
00:17:13,671 --> 00:17:19,361
and would take money and make big things".
I said, "All right.

119
00:17:19,562 --> 00:17:24,959
After all they are human beings. And as
human beings

120
00:17:25,282 --> 00:17:33,932
all their ideas will change. And they will
seek their peace and joy".

121
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:39,548
I must say that today in America it has
worked out wonders.

122
00:17:39,755 --> 00:17:45,910
In all the cities here, we have people who
are following Sahaja Yoga.

123
00:17:46,111 --> 00:17:54,884
Everyone who has come to Me is just
the same

124
00:17:55,085 --> 00:18:03,874
as any other Sahaja yogi who is from any
other country. Can you believe it?

125
00:18:04,104 --> 00:18:06,501
There's no difference at all

126
00:18:06,702 --> 00:18:12,265
in their expression, in their love,
in their compassion.

127
00:18:12,489 --> 00:18:18,890
All of them are so good and so beautiful.

128
00:18:19,091 --> 00:18:25,238
It is hard to believe that they've
forgotten all the differences.

129
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:28,452
And how have they mixed up together

130
00:18:28,637 --> 00:18:35,112
and are in such a loving state and
enjoyable state.

131
00:18:35,313 --> 00:18:43,233
It's a very different area into which you
have to enter and you enter into it,

132
00:18:43,434 --> 00:18:49,408
without doing anything whatsoever, only
your Kundalini rises

133
00:18:49,609 --> 00:18:54,718
and gives your self-realization. It is
effortless.

134
00:18:54,919 --> 00:19:00,906
Don't have to make any efforts, not
standing on your head or anything.

135
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:05,624
Just wherever you are sitting, you get your
self-realization.

136
00:19:05,825 --> 00:19:11,807
And once you get it, you grow into it.
You grow into it so well.

137
00:19:12,008 --> 00:19:19,623
You become so empowered. You are amazed
sometimes.

138
00:19:19,824 --> 00:19:26,347
You see people who were never poets;
they've suddenly become poets.

139
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:33,226
There are people who never could do
anything on the stage, were so frightened,

140
00:19:33,427 --> 00:19:36,088
have become great speakers.

141
00:19:36,289 --> 00:19:42,257
There are musicians who said, "Mother,
we didn't know how to sing".

142
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:47,261
So all kinds of creativity comes into it.

143
00:19:47,462 --> 00:19:52,335
How it comes and how suddenly it has
started they don't know.

144
00:19:52,536 --> 00:19:57,840
You become extremely creative and you start
appreciating

145
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:04,368
in a very subtle way the creativity
of others.

146
00:20:05,527 --> 00:20:11,288
Then, this stupid thing called greed,

147
00:20:11,489 --> 00:20:17,967
which has captured your country now, also,
is like this:

148
00:20:18,138 --> 00:20:25,508
that when people get some money, the taste
of that money makes them greedy.

149
00:20:25,681 --> 00:20:32,162
As simple as that. Now what happens with
Sahaja Yoga,

150
00:20:32,363 --> 00:20:40,414
you don't have any greed. The greed
finishes. You are a satisfied soul.

151
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:50,629
Why will you ask for so many cars, so many
aeroplanes? Not needed.

152
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:56,106
Because you become a wise person, become,
becoming is the point.

153
00:20:56,307 --> 00:21:04,267
You become so wise that you don't hanker
after things.

154
00:21:04,468 --> 00:21:10,106
You are extremely satisfied. But as
a result of that

155
00:21:10,307 --> 00:21:17,610
you are completely, fully blessed

156
00:21:17,811 --> 00:21:25,574
with a very beautiful life and everything
that you want is there.

157
00:21:25,775 --> 00:21:29,849
This is the blessings of the Divine

158
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:35,704
and so many miracles. So many miracles
that you are amazed

159
00:21:35,905 --> 00:21:40,766
how are you blessed. What have you done
to deserve this?

160
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:48,106
You are now the spirit. These are
the blessings of the spirit.

161
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:52,514
People get completely cured, no doubt,

162
00:21:52,715 --> 00:21:59,542
but also they become very compassionate,
extremely compassionate.

163
00:21:59,743 --> 00:22:03,564
And they don't understand from where did
they get this compassion,

164
00:22:03,765 --> 00:22:08,124
very compassionate people.

165
00:22:08,473 --> 00:22:16,025
Thirdly, they become thoughtlessly aware.

166
00:22:16,226 --> 00:22:20,591
That means complete silence within.

167
00:22:20,792 --> 00:22:29,608
You see something and you become silent.
You don't react, just you see.

168
00:22:29,809 --> 00:22:33,946
So enjoyable to see something clearly.

169
00:22:34,147 --> 00:22:41,671
But when you see something, your vibrations
act.

170
00:22:41,872 --> 00:22:47,883
It's a very powerful personality that when
you see something

171
00:22:48,084 --> 00:22:52,648
your vibrations act and they work it out.

172
00:22:52,849 --> 00:22:57,456
They can solve all kinds of problems.

173
00:22:57,657 --> 00:23:04,145
These vibrations can tell you what's wrong
with the other person,

174
00:23:04,346 --> 00:23:11,662
what's wrong with certain countries. And
also you should know how to correct it.

175
00:23:11,863 --> 00:23:21,778
If you can find out how you can correct
this, problem is solved.

176
00:23:21,979 --> 00:23:25,851
And it's so gentle and so sweet

177
00:23:26,052 --> 00:23:31,619
that you don't have to fight with this,
it just works.

178
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:37,548
You're all capable of becoming that
powerful person,

179
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:42,604
of that compassion, of that love and
understanding

180
00:23:42,805 --> 00:23:50,793
and you just develop this thoughtless
awareness, which is a very important state,

181
00:23:50,994 --> 00:23:57,181
which you don't feel bored, you don't get
upset,

182
00:23:57,382 --> 00:24:01,877
you're absolutely silently watching
everything

183
00:24:02,094 --> 00:24:06,033
and you become such a congenial personality

184
00:24:06,234 --> 00:24:13,361
that those who come in contact with you
also become very, very congenial.

185
00:24:13,562 --> 00:24:19,594
You can give realizations to others. You
yourself can do it.

186
00:24:19,795 --> 00:24:26,896
It's not only that you get your realization
but you can give realization.

187
00:24:27,097 --> 00:24:35,442
It's very surprising that you become so
powerful. You can change the atmosphere.

188
00:24:35,643 --> 00:24:41,662
You can work out so many things just with
turning of your mind

189
00:24:41,863 --> 00:24:52,300
and all the bad things like, we should say,
all the things that are very destructive,

190
00:24:52,501 --> 00:24:57,358
you just don't like it, just give up like
that.

191
00:24:57,559 --> 00:25:03,527
And also you protect yourself. You are
completely protected

192
00:25:03,728 --> 00:25:06,218
from all the evil doers.

193
00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:12,233
So is important that you become that
powerful personality

194
00:25:12,434 --> 00:25:17,546
which I call as the spiritual person.
People have been talking about it,

195
00:25:17,747 --> 00:25:22,372
saying all kinds of things. They read all
kinds of stories.

196
00:25:22,573 --> 00:25:26,694
Now the time has come for
the actualization.

197
00:25:26,895 --> 00:25:34,548
And this is so important, so very important
for you, that you get it.

198
00:25:34,749 --> 00:25:39,265
The time has come. It's your right, it's
your fundamental right, I say,

199
00:25:39,466 --> 00:25:43,710
to get to that state where you become

200
00:25:43,911 --> 00:25:49,333
absolutely a personality which is
spiritual,

201
00:25:49,534 --> 00:25:59,923
which is empowered and which knows how to,
how to use this power, how to work it out.

202
00:26:00,124 --> 00:26:10,215
It's very surprising how the more advanced
we are, the less chances there are,

203
00:26:10,416 --> 00:26:14,781
because we are lost, lost in the forest
of advancement.

204
00:26:14,982 --> 00:26:21,735
But despite all that, people find it so
difficult

205
00:26:21,936 --> 00:26:27,229
to exist in such busy atmosphere,

206
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:32,600
they come to Sahaj and they get completely
peaceful.

207
00:26:32,801 --> 00:26:39,266
Whatever it is, whatever kind of life it
is, they are absolutely peaceful.

208
00:26:39,467 --> 00:26:46,364
And you give peace to others. I have spoken
for thousands of times

209
00:26:46,565 --> 00:26:53,654
all over the world and I think it works.
It does work.

210
00:26:53,855 --> 00:26:57,842
They wanted Me to allow you to ask some
questions.

211
00:26:58,043 --> 00:27:01,814
I don't mind you asking Me questions

212
00:27:02,015 --> 00:27:11,615
but the problem is, this questioning also
can be quite stupid sometimes.

213
00:27:13,895 --> 00:27:19,646
If you want to waste sometime on certain
amount of stupidity, you can ask Me,

214
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:23,453
I don't mind.

215
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:31,621
So, if somebody wants to ask Me questions?

216
00:27:43,281 --> 00:27:53,709
So have you got some people who want to ask
questions? No. All right.

217
00:27:53,910 --> 00:28:00,511
So now, we'll have the session for
self-realization.

218
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:04,236
It's very simple.

219
00:28:09,002 --> 00:28:16,331
What you have to do is to put both your
hands like this towards Me.

220
00:28:42,533 --> 00:28:45,025
All right.

221
00:28:49,165 --> 00:28:51,723
Now,

222
00:28:55,205 --> 00:28:59,760
please close your eyes. Please all of you
close your eyes.

223
00:28:59,961 --> 00:29:05,779
There's no mesmerism. So please close your
eyes.

224
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:46,661
First put your left hand towards Me

225
00:29:46,862 --> 00:29:53,786
and right hand on top of your head
on the fontanel bone area,

226
00:29:53,987 --> 00:29:57,220
left hand towards Me.

227
00:29:59,595 --> 00:30:02,328
Now,

228
00:30:03,585 --> 00:30:07,079
put the right hand towards Me

229
00:30:09,326 --> 00:30:19,436
and put the left hand on top of your head
not touching the head, above.

230
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:32,647
Not both the hands, one on top of your
head, only one.

231
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:38,030
Keep your eyes shut.

232
00:30:45,854 --> 00:30:48,242
Now,

233
00:30:49,471 --> 00:30:54,899
all those who are feeling cool breeze
in your hand

234
00:30:55,100 --> 00:31:00,383
try to see that it comes on top of your
hand, not below.

235
00:31:00,584 --> 00:31:03,498
If it is coming below just push it up.

236
00:31:03,699 --> 00:31:08,062
You can open your eyes and see.

237
00:31:17,604 --> 00:31:23,229
First, put both your hands towards Me
again,

238
00:31:24,624 --> 00:31:29,505
see, if you are feeling a cool breeze
in your hands

239
00:31:29,706 --> 00:31:35,374
or you are feeling a cool breeze coming
out of your head.

240
00:31:35,575 --> 00:31:43,243
Could be hot, could be hot. If it is hot,
try to forgive people.

241
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:47,712
Could be hot but doesn't matter.

242
00:32:09,548 --> 00:32:18,375
All those who have felt cool or hot breeze
coming into their hands

243
00:32:18,576 --> 00:32:22,559
or out of their fontanel bone area,

244
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:27,734
please raise your hands, both your hands.

245
00:32:28,865 --> 00:32:31,889
Don't be afraid.

246
00:32:48,847 --> 00:32:55,110
Most of you, most of you have felt it.

247
00:32:56,022 --> 00:32:59,497
May God bless you.

248
00:33:02,729 --> 00:33:09,484
How many of you have not felt, please
raise your hands.

249
00:33:17,185 --> 00:33:20,533
Hardly any.

250
00:33:28,696 --> 00:33:37,255
Very surprising. Very happy to see that
most of you have felt the cool breeze.

251
00:33:37,456 --> 00:33:41,124
May God bless you.

252
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:44,958
Thank you very much.
