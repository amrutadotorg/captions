00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:05.301
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:19:05.301 --> 00:19:23.542
That’s a very interesting subject that has
been given to Me to talk to you people because

00:19:23.542 --> 00:19:34.140
I have been always worried about the IAS,
IPS, and other Government servants, very much

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:39.911
worried because I have known the kind of life
My husband was leading.

00:19:39.911 --> 00:19:52.081
And I used to think: if these new people,
who have come to the services, to the Government

00:19:52.081 --> 00:20:01.850
service, we have to tell them the dangers
that are ahead of them.

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:07.221
Because we don’t know what is the subtle
system within us, which works.

00:20:07.221 --> 00:20:15.870
And in the subtle system, when we lead this
kind of a very speedy, intensive life, it

00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:17.110
has a defect.

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:23.711
It has a defect you can see in the chart.

00:20:23.711 --> 00:20:36.401
They have shown the, they have shown the subtle
system which works it out.

00:20:36.401 --> 00:20:44.591
So we have a center here on the crossing of
the optic chiasma.

00:20:44.591 --> 00:20:51.940
These, this center is very important because
we react with this.

00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:55.230
We react to everything.

00:20:55.230 --> 00:21:02.631
By this reaction we create a problem within
ourselves.

00:21:02.631 --> 00:21:12.101
And this reaction comes to us because we do
not know how to go beyond the mind.

00:21:12.101 --> 00:21:16.401
Every time we are looking at something, we
react.

00:21:16.401 --> 00:21:20.021
We look at someone, we react.

00:21:20.021 --> 00:21:21.541
But we cannot just watch.

00:21:21.541 --> 00:21:24.461
We cannot be just the witness.

00:21:24.461 --> 00:21:29.651
If we could be the witness, it will not have
any effect on us.

00:21:29.651 --> 00:21:31.211
But we cannot be.

00:21:31.211 --> 00:21:35.791
That’s the trouble when this center is very
active.

00:21:35.791 --> 00:21:44.310
We call it as Agnya chakra, where the two
optic nerves meet.

00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:50.501
At the crossing point, this center is placed.

00:21:50.501 --> 00:21:55.511
Even Jung has said that, “You have to go
beyond your thoughts and that you have to

00:21:55.511 --> 00:21:58.230
become thoughtlessly aware.”

00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:04.751
Even in our Shastras is it written that, “You
have to have Nirvichar Samadhi,” is without

00:22:04.751 --> 00:22:09.091
thought and the another is Nirvikalpa Samadhi.

00:22:09.091 --> 00:22:14.911
Now even Einstein has said that, “You have
to go beyond the mind to reach the torsion

00:22:14.911 --> 00:22:15.991
area,” he calls.

00:22:15.991 --> 00:22:22.161
When he was searching for his Theory of Relativity,
he found it was difficult.

00:22:22.161 --> 00:22:23.571
He couldn’t find it.

00:22:23.571 --> 00:22:24.980
He got very tired.

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:29.620
He went into his garden and was playing with
soap bubbles like a child.

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:36.131
Then he says, “Suddenly from somewhere else
it dawned upon me this Theory of Relativity.”

00:22:36.131 --> 00:22:44.301
He calls it openly as a torsion area and this
torsion area we have to touch instead of ourselves

00:22:44.301 --> 00:22:46.461
thinking all the time and reacting.

00:22:46.461 --> 00:22:51.931
Because as a result of that what happens we
should see.

00:22:51.931 --> 00:23:00.461
What happens is that our movement on the autonomous
nervous system goes to the right side.

00:23:00.461 --> 00:23:06.211
The right side, it’s very good otherwise:
A person looks very impressive.

00:23:06.211 --> 00:23:08.010
He can oppress other.

00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:09.450
He can be aggressive.

00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:11.920
He can be very systematic.

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:16.941
All these things can be there but it has a
reaction.

00:23:16.941 --> 00:23:25.671
The reaction is horrible because this right
side affects our liver to begin with.

00:23:25.671 --> 00:23:32.141
Now the liver is called ‘liver’ because
live, we live because of liver only.

00:23:32.141 --> 00:23:34.811
That’s why it’s called ‘liver’.

00:23:34.811 --> 00:23:41.641
This liver gets affected and there is no actually
treatment we should say in the medical science

00:23:41.641 --> 00:23:42.641
for liver.

00:23:42.641 --> 00:23:45.901
They can replace it with a pig’s liver or
some liver like that.

00:23:45.901 --> 00:23:48.891
But otherwise, there is no way out.

00:23:48.891 --> 00:23:55.181
But we are the ones we are spoiling this liver
ourself by creating tremendous heat in the

00:23:55.181 --> 00:23:56.711
liver.

00:23:56.711 --> 00:24:10.821
This special liver has got a capacity to absorb
heat and release heat into the blood stream

00:24:10.821 --> 00:24:14.371
and then, you see, it gets relieved of it.

00:24:14.371 --> 00:24:23.391
But when it is too much, when the liver is
too much full of heat then it cannot give

00:24:23.391 --> 00:24:26.851
up that heat.

00:24:26.851 --> 00:24:32.161
Then heat, this heat, heat starts traveling
upward.

00:24:32.161 --> 00:24:37.561
It can go to the right lung.

00:24:37.561 --> 00:24:41.431
It can go to the heart.

00:24:41.431 --> 00:24:46.021
Now imagine, right lung means asthma.

00:24:46.021 --> 00:24:50.301
Simple thing is asthma.

00:24:50.301 --> 00:24:52.561
Then it goes to the heart.

00:24:52.561 --> 00:25:00.001
There’s a young boy, say of twenty one years
or so, up to that age.

00:25:00.001 --> 00:25:05.981
He starts playing cricket, tennis, and drinks
a lot.

00:25:05.981 --> 00:25:08.861
Then he gets a massive heart attack.

00:25:08.861 --> 00:25:10.801
It’s fatal.

00:25:10.801 --> 00:25:13.701
He cannot live.

00:25:13.701 --> 00:25:20.041
Then it affects as I told you other organs
also.

00:25:20.041 --> 00:25:32.961
This heat goes to the pancreas causing diabetes
of a very serious nature, not of a mild nature

00:25:32.961 --> 00:25:34.941
but a very serious nature.

00:25:34.941 --> 00:25:39.811
Then this heat passes down to the spleen.

00:25:39.811 --> 00:25:45.361
In the spleen, it gives you blood cancer.

00:25:45.361 --> 00:25:48.951
This is all possible for all right sided people,
I am telling you.

00:25:48.951 --> 00:25:54.921
That’s why I was worried that people who
are, according to Me, are the spine of our

00:25:54.921 --> 00:25:55.921
country.

00:25:55.921 --> 00:25:59.141
They are the spine of our country.

00:25:59.141 --> 00:26:09.921
They should not get out of life because of
too much of strain and stress on their mind.

00:26:09.921 --> 00:26:11.841
Now then it goes to the kidneys.

00:26:11.841 --> 00:26:16.391
It coagulates the kidneys and you get kidney
trouble.

00:26:16.391 --> 00:26:20.851
You cannot pass urine and you have all the
troubles there.

00:26:20.851 --> 00:26:27.691
Apart from that, it goes to the lower intestines
and you get terrible constipations and all

00:26:27.691 --> 00:26:31.371
the problems of the constipation.

00:26:31.371 --> 00:26:38.351
Then also to the heart at a later age it comes.

00:26:38.351 --> 00:26:40.571
It goes on affecting.

00:26:40.571 --> 00:26:46.131
Ultimately your heart fails very early in
age.

00:26:46.131 --> 00:26:55.301
I know of, recently, two people died of heart
trouble who were at a very good position.

00:26:55.301 --> 00:27:04.911
This is very much worrying Me that how to
bring them to close to themselves, to know

00:27:04.911 --> 00:27:09.651
themselves what’s the problem is and how
to solve that problem.

00:27:09.651 --> 00:27:19.791
With this we understand that we react, by
reaction we create such a heat within us.

00:27:19.791 --> 00:27:27.501
Apart from this, the other psychosomatic diseases,
this is the, I am telling you about somatic,

00:27:27.501 --> 00:27:32.740
but the psycho disease which comes from your
psychological problems come from the left

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:33.740
side.

00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:36.290
Of course I’ll not deal with that now.

00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:43.410
But somehow, if you can move from right to
the left, you are sure to get some psychosomatic

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:51.121
trouble which cannot be cured by medical science,
like cancer, aches, all kinds of this.

00:27:51.121 --> 00:27:55.301
So you are just preparing your body for that.

00:27:55.301 --> 00:28:02.160
In these modern times, the life is so full
of struggle, speed.

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:08.410
Now we were coming and there was a jam.

00:28:08.410 --> 00:28:10.450
Now you can’t help it.

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:16.571
I was very silently watching, “Now this,
the jam, I have to reach late, doesn’t matter.”

00:28:16.571 --> 00:28:21.081
My husband normally would’ve been really
in great trouble.

00:28:21.081 --> 00:28:24.231
He would’ve looked at the watch all the
time.

00:28:24.231 --> 00:28:25.340
Would have been “Where are we?

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:27.551
What are we doing?” this and that.

00:28:27.551 --> 00:28:34.111
But he was so silently watching the whole
thing, I was amazed because normally he would

00:28:34.111 --> 00:28:38.931
be jittering that we are getting so late for
a function like.

00:28:38.931 --> 00:28:50.770
Now, you see, once you get rid of this problem,
is the easiest thing to live.

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:55.171
The other day I met one gentleman who was
transferred.

00:28:55.171 --> 00:28:56.960
He said “Always whenever!”

00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:03.801
He is an IAS officer, “Whenever I am transferred,
Mother, I used to be so jittery.

00:29:03.801 --> 00:29:06.530
Such tension, such stress on my mind, baba.

00:29:06.530 --> 00:29:07.681
What will happen?

00:29:07.681 --> 00:29:09.611
Where will the children go?

00:29:09.611 --> 00:29:11.611
What will happen to the house?

00:29:11.611 --> 00:29:15.321
This, that, all problems would come to me.

00:29:15.321 --> 00:29:19.271
But what has happened to me and my wife, we
don’t feel anything now.

00:29:19.271 --> 00:29:20.431
We don’t feel.

00:29:20.431 --> 00:29:21.950
We are not worried.

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:23.450
We sleep very well.”

00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:26.001
I said, “That’s what has to happen.

00:29:26.001 --> 00:29:29.100
All these things should not affect you.”

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:34.741
That’s only possible when you can go beyond
this mind, which we think.

00:29:34.741 --> 00:29:42.020
Mind is a, not such a good word, I should
say because it’s not mental.

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:49.830
It is, if it is only mind means the one which
thinks and for them mental hospital is also

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:50.830
mad people.

00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:54.231
I don’t know how English language moves,
it’s difficult you know.

00:29:54.231 --> 00:30:01.580
English language is very difficult to explain
Sahaja Yoga because in the English language

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:06.551
you’ll be amazed that they call ‘spirit’.

00:30:06.551 --> 00:30:14.311
‘Spirit’ is the Atma, right, ‘spirit’
is the dead body moving about according to

00:30:14.311 --> 00:30:19.501
them and thirdly it means also alcohol.

00:30:19.501 --> 00:30:24.551
Now which one is closer to which one, I don’t
know, but this is why I am saying that English

00:30:24.551 --> 00:30:26.570
language is a difficult thing.

00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:33.361
Marathi is the best because lot of work has
been done among Maharashtrians on Kundalini.

00:30:33.361 --> 00:30:35.770
Nath Panthis were there.

00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:37.541
They have done lot of work.

00:30:37.541 --> 00:30:44.071
But the tradition was that one person would
give Realization to only one person.

00:30:44.071 --> 00:30:52.671
If I have done anything you think worth mentioning,
it is that I tried to find out a way of giving

00:30:52.671 --> 00:30:55.660
collective Realization, collective happening.

00:30:55.660 --> 00:31:03.491
That’s what was My humble contribution and
by which I find thousands of people have got

00:31:03.491 --> 00:31:04.981
their Realization.

00:31:04.981 --> 00:31:06.691
Now what is the Realization?

00:31:06.691 --> 00:31:15.210
It is that if you see at the base of the spinal
chord is a triangular bone called as ‘Sacrum’.

00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:22.491
It is called ‘Sacrum’ because it is a
sacred bone and the Greeks knew about it,

00:31:22.491 --> 00:31:24.410
that it’s a sacred bone.

00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:32.280
And according to our Shastras and also many
other prophecies, there resides a power within

00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:38.090
us, our own power, your own power called as
Kundalini.

00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:43.871
Is called ‘Kundalini’ because it is in
three and a half coils.

00:31:43.871 --> 00:31:48.731
Coils are called ‘kundal’, that’s why
it is the Kundalini.

00:31:48.731 --> 00:31:53.691
Now this, this power is your own.

00:31:53.691 --> 00:32:03.830
It’s in every human being and if it is awakened,
it passes through six centers piercing through

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:11.251
the top of the head, which we call as the
Brahmarandhra in the Sanskrit language and

00:32:11.251 --> 00:32:13.890
the fontanel area in the English language.

00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:19.640
It passes through that soft bone which was
there in the childhood and you just start

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:26.140
feeling the cool breeze coming out of your
head and the cool breeze coming on to your

00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:27.140
fingertips.

00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:28.140
It happens.

00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:32.291
It’s an experience and for which you cannot
pay.

00:32:32.291 --> 00:32:33.291
You cannot.

00:32:33.291 --> 00:32:36.710
I may go on telling you lots of stories this,
that, that won’t work out.

00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:38.220
It has to happen.

00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:44.600
The Kundalini has to rise and has to pierce
through fontanel area otherwise, otherwise,

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:46.541
it’s no use.

00:32:46.541 --> 00:32:51.080
It’s just words, some sermon or something
like that.

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:58.440
So this happening is very easy in this Kaliyuga.

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:04.720
Is really remarkable because maybe because
of Kaliyug people are fed up of the things

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:09.041
going on and all kinds of things working out.

00:33:09.041 --> 00:33:10.981
Now what does it do?

00:33:10.981 --> 00:33:14.900
It passes through six center.

00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:24.820
Six centers, these are meant for our physical,
mental, and emotional being and also for our

00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:26.041
spiritual being.

00:33:26.041 --> 00:33:33.131
So when it passes through these six centers,
it nourishes those centers, it integrates

00:33:33.131 --> 00:33:41.910
all these centers, and ultimately it passes
through this and enters into the all pervading

00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:46.671
power of Divine love, is called as ‘Paramchaitanya’.

00:33:46.671 --> 00:33:55.751
You may call it as ‘all pervading power
of Divine love’ or anything but names make

00:33:55.751 --> 00:33:56.751
no difference.

00:33:56.751 --> 00:34:04.501
There is a very subtle power around us, which
looks after us, which guides us, which helps

00:34:04.501 --> 00:34:07.441
us, which is the torsion area.

00:34:07.441 --> 00:34:17.331
Now, while doing that what happens that you
become knowledgeable of the absolute truth,

00:34:17.331 --> 00:34:18.331
absolute!

00:34:18.331 --> 00:34:25.130
Whatever you know is absolute, is nothing
to doubt, nothing can be challenged.

00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:30.541
For example, it starts flowing through your
fingertips.

00:34:30.541 --> 00:34:35.030
Starts flowing through your fingertips and
you can feel it on your fingertips, your centers.

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:41.030
Now these are five, six, and seven centers,
five, six and seven centers.

00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:43.551
I am not going to tell you all the details
now.

00:34:43.551 --> 00:34:54.910
But when you start feeling these whole sensation,
Adi Shankaracharya has called it as ‘spand’,

00:34:54.910 --> 00:35:01.130
then you feel the truth, the real truth.

00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:08.190
For example, supposing in your office you
get somebody who is a cheat, very well dressed,

00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:12.440
speaks English very well, you know, very well
behaved.

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:15.270
How will you make him out?

00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:19.271
Just have to put your hands under your table
and see for yourself.

00:35:19.271 --> 00:35:26.541
Immediately you will get some sort of a burning
sensation or you might feel some sort of a,

00:35:26.541 --> 00:35:31.580
what do you call, needle and pins like that.

00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:33.760
That kind of a feeling you might get.

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:37.991
Then you will also know what centers he’s
catching on your fingertips.

00:35:37.991 --> 00:35:41.900
This is the absolute knowledge about everything.

00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:48.260
Is not question of only knowing he is a bad
or a good person, but also of diseases.

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:53.631
Supposing you have some disease, you will
feel it on your fingertips.

00:35:53.631 --> 00:35:55.590
On your fingertips you’ll feel it.

00:35:55.590 --> 00:36:00.811
You’ll know this is your disease and if
you know how to cure them, you can cure others

00:36:00.811 --> 00:36:04.201
also because you become one with the whole.

00:36:04.201 --> 00:36:08.361
It’s a very collective personality you develop.

00:36:08.361 --> 00:36:10.821
Who is the other, after all?

00:36:10.821 --> 00:36:12.461
We are all one.

00:36:12.461 --> 00:36:17.981
But only trouble is we are separated because
of this ignorance.

00:36:17.981 --> 00:36:22.741
Once this works out, so many things drop out
from us.

00:36:22.741 --> 00:36:31.091
This is the right side I am telling you about
but also the conditionings are very much working

00:36:31.091 --> 00:36:32.091
out in us.

00:36:32.091 --> 00:36:35.831
In our reaction, there are two things that
work out.

00:36:35.831 --> 00:36:39.102
One is the right side, another the left side.

00:36:39.102 --> 00:36:42.871
And the left side is all the conditioning
as you see there.

00:36:42.871 --> 00:36:50.441
These conditionings come to us through our
childhood, through our family, through our

00:36:50.441 --> 00:36:56.051
country, through our reading, this, that all
kinds of things, they come up.

00:36:56.051 --> 00:37:06.761
But also family upbringing is very important
because according to our Shaastraas, there

00:37:06.761 --> 00:37:07.761
are six enemies.

00:37:07.761 --> 00:37:08.761
We have got six.

00:37:08.761 --> 00:37:10.381
Now these six enemies are what?

00:37:10.381 --> 00:37:15.351
So Kama, Krodha, Mada, Matsara, Lobha, Moha.

00:37:15.351 --> 00:37:18.981
Kama is what you can call sexual urge.

00:37:18.981 --> 00:37:20.491
Krodha is anger.

00:37:20.491 --> 00:37:23.001
Krishna has denounced anger.

00:37:23.001 --> 00:37:26.971
But all right sided people are hot tempered.

00:37:26.971 --> 00:37:30.091
They don’t want to be, but they are.

00:37:30.091 --> 00:37:33.211
And when they lose their temper then they
feel bad also.

00:37:33.211 --> 00:37:36.571
Not that they want to lose it but they just
lose it.

00:37:36.571 --> 00:37:38.521
Now this one drops out.

00:37:38.521 --> 00:37:47.691
The temper goes out completely because you
develop that witness state saakshi swaroopa.

00:37:47.691 --> 00:37:51.161
With that witness state you just see everything.

00:37:51.161 --> 00:37:52.981
You don’t lose temper.

00:37:52.981 --> 00:37:54.811
You just see it.

00:37:54.811 --> 00:37:57.881
That is one thing drops out very well.

00:37:57.881 --> 00:38:01.991
Mada is false pride.

00:38:01.991 --> 00:38:02.991
That we have.

00:38:02.991 --> 00:38:05.811
I know IAS officers and their wives.

00:38:05.811 --> 00:38:07.651
They have that false pride.

00:38:07.651 --> 00:38:12.181
Not everyone, but some of them do, they have.

00:38:12.181 --> 00:38:14.821
I have very funny experiences of that.

00:38:14.821 --> 00:38:20.601
Like, once we went to Delhi to Hatriji and
they had given us a house in Mina Bagh and

00:38:20.601 --> 00:38:25.621
I met another friend of Mine from Lucknow
who had married an IAS officer.

00:38:25.621 --> 00:38:30.361
Oh, very proud girl and she asked Me, “Where
are you living?

00:38:30.361 --> 00:38:31.361
How are you?”

00:38:31.361 --> 00:38:34.621
I said, “My husband is a government servant
and so he’s transferred here.”

00:38:34.621 --> 00:38:35.861
“But where are you living?”

00:38:35.861 --> 00:38:37.101
I said “Mina Bagh.”

00:38:37.101 --> 00:38:38.101
“Oh my God!

00:38:38.101 --> 00:38:39.101
Mina Bagh!

00:38:39.101 --> 00:38:40.101
What is your husband doing?

00:38:40.101 --> 00:38:41.101
Is he a clerk?

00:38:41.101 --> 00:38:42.101
What is he doing?”

00:38:42.101 --> 00:38:46.701
I said, “He’s doing something” and I
was just looking at her the way she was on

00:38:46.701 --> 00:38:47.701
Me.

00:38:47.701 --> 00:38:51.011
“My husband might be your husband’s boss”
this and that.

00:38:51.011 --> 00:38:54.841
I said, “Maybe I don’t know anything about
these things.

00:38:54.841 --> 00:38:57.811
I am sorry, I don’t know your list of people,
anything.

00:38:57.811 --> 00:38:59.591
I am not interested.”

00:38:59.591 --> 00:39:01.971
And then My husband came.

00:39:01.971 --> 00:39:03.751
So she said, “See that tall man.

00:39:03.751 --> 00:39:06.251
You know he’s very important.

00:39:06.251 --> 00:39:08.141
He’s with the Prime Minister.

00:39:08.141 --> 00:39:12.391
You go and talk to him and get Your husband
promoted.”

00:39:12.391 --> 00:39:23.721
I said ([Laughing] What is she up to?), I
said, “Sudhali, he is My husband.”

00:39:23.721 --> 00:39:24.721
“Heh!

00:39:24.721 --> 00:39:26.361
He’s your husband?

00:39:26.361 --> 00:39:27.361
Haan yaar!

00:39:27.361 --> 00:39:28.761
Oh my God!

00:39:28.761 --> 00:39:30.691
I am sorry I am.”

00:39:30.691 --> 00:39:32.861
I said, “It’s all right.”

00:39:32.861 --> 00:39:33.861
Common experience.

00:39:33.861 --> 00:39:42.441
The women also become IAS, you see, not actually
but as wives and I’ve been such a lost person

00:39:42.441 --> 00:39:44.501
with them.

00:39:44.501 --> 00:39:50.681
I could never understand what is there to
be IAS and to be his wife.

00:39:50.681 --> 00:39:52.481
It was beyond Me.

00:39:52.481 --> 00:39:59.021
But one thing, what really helped Me in all
this turmoil of life, because you know our

00:39:59.021 --> 00:40:09.701
pay is less, this, that all problems are there,
was the patriotism Raashtra Bhakti.

00:40:09.701 --> 00:40:11.761
My father was a great patriot.

00:40:11.761 --> 00:40:12.921
My mother was.

00:40:12.921 --> 00:40:17.911
They sacrificed everything for the independence
of this country.

00:40:17.911 --> 00:40:23.341
I cannot travel by any foreign airlines, whatever
maybe.

00:40:23.341 --> 00:40:26.041
Maybe Air India is not good, doesn’t matter.

00:40:26.041 --> 00:40:28.371
It’s My, My country’s.

00:40:28.371 --> 00:40:35.301
So the feeling that this is My country kept
Me going.

00:40:35.301 --> 00:40:39.231
You see you become like a Kargil soldier.

00:40:39.231 --> 00:40:42.211
You are fighting for your country.

00:40:42.211 --> 00:40:47.141
You are working for your country.

00:40:47.141 --> 00:40:50.401
My husband got into Indian Foreign Service.

00:40:50.401 --> 00:40:51.741
I told him, “Nothing doing.

00:40:51.741 --> 00:40:56.431
We don’t drink, both of us and I can’t
leave My country in the lurch at the time

00:40:56.431 --> 00:40:58.471
when we have got the freedom.

00:40:58.471 --> 00:41:00.921
So if you want you can go, I will not come.

00:41:00.921 --> 00:41:03.081
I don’t want to go to Foreign Service.”

00:41:03.081 --> 00:41:04.521
They cut his pay.

00:41:04.521 --> 00:41:07.331
That time, you know, 300 was a big amount.

00:41:07.331 --> 00:41:08.951
I said, “Doesn’t matter.

00:41:08.951 --> 00:41:10.971
Whatever it is, I’ll stay in My country.

00:41:10.971 --> 00:41:13.461
I’ll work in My country and you work here.

00:41:13.461 --> 00:41:15.971
I’ll support you every way.

00:41:15.971 --> 00:41:18.651
I don’t want anything.

00:41:18.651 --> 00:41:25.561
Nothing I want and you don’t take a bribe
at all otherwise that day I’ll leave this.”

00:41:25.561 --> 00:41:33.471
Otherwise also I said that, “The another
thing is our country has to develop.”

00:41:33.471 --> 00:41:36.481
Who will develop?

00:41:36.481 --> 00:41:41.031
I always felt that you are the spinal cord
of our country.

00:41:41.031 --> 00:41:43.241
You have to develop this country.

00:41:43.241 --> 00:41:44.241
What is this money?

00:41:44.241 --> 00:41:45.241
Comes and goes.

00:41:45.241 --> 00:41:50.621
You’ve seen the people who have got money,
where their children have gone?

00:41:50.621 --> 00:41:53.181
What has happened to them?

00:41:53.181 --> 00:41:54.181
What have they achieved?

00:41:54.181 --> 00:41:58.901
So I told very frankly that I will not go
to the Foreign Service of any kind because

00:41:58.901 --> 00:42:00.541
what is in the Foreign Service?

00:42:00.541 --> 00:42:06.581
I want to do everything in this country of
Mine for which I have also fought.

00:42:06.581 --> 00:42:13.971
I have fought a lot and this is what now sometimes,
you know, is disappointing to see what things

00:42:13.971 --> 00:42:15.061
are happening.

00:42:15.061 --> 00:42:16.421
But a day will come.

00:42:16.421 --> 00:42:18.211
This country will rise.

00:42:18.211 --> 00:42:19.211
How?

00:42:19.211 --> 00:42:24.771
Because when this happens, when this Kundalini
rising take place, when people become realized

00:42:24.771 --> 00:42:27.291
souls, they just transform.

00:42:27.291 --> 00:42:34.861
They become extremely patriotic, extremely
patriotic and they understand what is needed

00:42:34.861 --> 00:42:37.161
today for our country.

00:42:37.161 --> 00:42:39.101
They can sacrifice anything.

00:42:39.101 --> 00:42:48.061
They can live anywhere and they are not bothered
about some sort of a, you can call it a financial

00:42:48.061 --> 00:42:50.891
help or other material thing.

00:42:50.891 --> 00:42:53.151
They are above materialism.

00:42:53.151 --> 00:43:01.071
There are thousands and thousands like that
even in our country, thousands and also abroad.

00:43:01.071 --> 00:43:03.901
Now Sahaja Yoga is working 86 countries.

00:43:03.901 --> 00:43:13.031
They are all full of joy because with this
happening you get joy of a quality which has

00:43:13.031 --> 00:43:14.031
no double thing.

00:43:14.031 --> 00:43:15.311
It’s not happiness / unhappiness.

00:43:15.311 --> 00:43:22.541
It’s just joy and you have another thing
also with it, is the peace of mind.

00:43:22.541 --> 00:43:26.861
Just you are so peaceful, absolutely peaceful.

00:43:26.861 --> 00:43:31.401
You don’t have to worry about things.

00:43:31.401 --> 00:43:37.551
You don’t have to become jittery because
see the diseases you develop.

00:43:37.551 --> 00:43:41.871
Apart from that, all kinds of paralysis comes
on us.

00:43:41.871 --> 00:43:47.241
We had a doctor in our hospital there who
was working very hard.

00:43:47.241 --> 00:43:50.871
I told him that, “Doctor, see now your age
has come.

00:43:50.871 --> 00:43:52.381
You should take it easy.

00:43:52.381 --> 00:43:53.941
Daytime you must rest.

00:43:53.941 --> 00:43:55.111
There’s no need.

00:43:55.111 --> 00:43:59.161
You are not in a office, just rest, take rest
do something else.

00:43:59.161 --> 00:44:01.591
Read or you can go and play.

00:44:01.591 --> 00:44:02.591
Do something.”

00:44:02.591 --> 00:44:08.921
He wouldn’t listen to Me and then he got
paraplegia, means that failure of the hand

00:44:08.921 --> 00:44:10.551
and the leg, completely.

00:44:10.551 --> 00:44:11.821
He couldn’t even walk.

00:44:11.821 --> 00:44:13.971
He couldn’t lift his leg.

00:44:13.971 --> 00:44:16.131
Now he’s all right, cured.

00:44:16.131 --> 00:44:20.131
But then I told him that you take treatment
for your right side.

00:44:20.131 --> 00:44:21.911
That’s very important.

00:44:21.911 --> 00:44:27.531
It’s very simple treatment and which can
be done very easily.

00:44:27.531 --> 00:44:31.871
For example, you can have an ice bag on the
liver.

00:44:31.871 --> 00:44:35.621
You can have ice bag here because this is
the portion.

00:44:35.621 --> 00:44:39.731
This moves like this so the portion this one
gets heated up.

00:44:39.731 --> 00:44:43.851
So you put ice here, you put ice.

00:44:43.851 --> 00:44:47.711
This icing business will really help you a
lot.

00:44:47.711 --> 00:44:54.861
But also there are some other very simple
homely treatments which you can take.

00:44:54.861 --> 00:44:59.281
But I would request all of you to come to
our center somewhere in

00:44:59.281 --> 00:45:01.111
Mother talks aside: [Bhaaratiya?

00:45:01.111 --> 00:45:02.481
Wahan hai na?

00:45:02.481 --> 00:45:04.771
Bharatiya, usmein hai ki nahi?]

00:45:04.771 --> 00:45:06.561
Where is she gone?

00:45:06.561 --> 00:45:09.731
Somebody says, “Bhaaratiya Vidya Peeth.”

00:45:09.731 --> 00:45:14.881
Shri Mataji: So you all can come there if
you live in this area.

00:45:14.881 --> 00:45:17.691
In every area, we have got centers.

00:45:17.691 --> 00:45:20.841
So you all can come into that center humbly.

00:45:20.841 --> 00:45:28.151
There is, you see, in Sahaja Yoga there is
nothing like any position or anything.

00:45:28.151 --> 00:45:29.801
We have to humble down.

00:45:29.801 --> 00:45:32.741
This false pride is of no use.

00:45:32.741 --> 00:45:33.911
We humble down.

00:45:33.911 --> 00:45:41.031
When we humble down, it’s very easy to achieve
it and to get this into yourself.

00:45:41.031 --> 00:45:43.341
After all, otherwise, what is it?

00:45:43.341 --> 00:45:45.851
What is life for?

00:45:45.851 --> 00:45:47.571
There’s no enjoyment.

00:45:47.571 --> 00:45:51.841
There’s no experiencing of what you are
doing.

00:45:51.841 --> 00:45:54.891
So much work you put in I know, I know that.

00:45:54.891 --> 00:45:58.191
I know how you people have to work hard.

00:45:58.191 --> 00:46:06.051
But to get over, to get over all the strain
and stress, you must do meditation for five

00:46:06.051 --> 00:46:08.241
minutes which they will tell you how to do
it.

00:46:08.241 --> 00:46:11.661
Five minutes in the evening will help you.

00:46:11.661 --> 00:46:19.241
So, just like as you take bath in the morning,
bathe yourself with the showers of this Kundalini.

00:46:19.241 --> 00:46:20.511
She’s your mother.

00:46:20.511 --> 00:46:29.283
She has been your mother from ages and she
has recorded everything about you within itself.

00:46:29.283 --> 00:46:35.091
This is the subtle side of you and when you
want to have your Realization, she’s very

00:46:35.091 --> 00:46:37.311
anxious to be awakened.

00:46:37.311 --> 00:46:40.921
She’s extremely anxious and it works wonders.

00:46:40.921 --> 00:46:46.301
I am surprised that how people get Realization
in no time.

00:46:46.301 --> 00:46:51.821
The only trouble with them is, it’s like
a primule or you can call it the ‘ankuraa’,

00:46:51.821 --> 00:46:55.071
which grows but it doesn’t become a tree.

00:46:55.071 --> 00:46:58.151
So, little bit you have to meditate.

00:46:58.151 --> 00:46:59.151
You have to be collective and works out.

00:46:59.151 --> 00:47:04.461
In collective, you forget everything, your
position everything.

00:47:04.461 --> 00:47:10.711
I have known IAS officers who have been dancing
with the villagers, singing with the villagers,

00:47:10.711 --> 00:47:11.901
so much they enjoy.

00:47:11.901 --> 00:47:16.751
They said, “We knew this but we never wanted
to express it, you see.”

00:47:16.751 --> 00:47:18.371
So all this drops out.

00:47:18.371 --> 00:47:23.411
All these outward bondages drop out and you
become one with the collective.

00:47:23.411 --> 00:47:24.691
You know their problems.

00:47:24.691 --> 00:47:28.611
You know how to solve them and it’s very
good.

00:47:28.611 --> 00:47:33.801
I think this is what is only one has to achieve,
nothing else.

00:47:33.801 --> 00:47:38.121
If you achieve this, you’ve achieved the
last and the best.

00:47:38.121 --> 00:47:41.441
With this then you can help others.

00:47:41.441 --> 00:47:43.701
You can give Realizations to others.

00:47:43.701 --> 00:47:44.931
You can save their lives.

00:47:44.931 --> 00:47:48.661
I mean, it’s all your power that is going
to work out.

00:47:48.661 --> 00:47:57.991
In these days of horrible struggle and all
kinds of things happening, violence, very

00:47:57.991 --> 00:48:01.601
much needed is this Sahaja Yoga.

00:48:01.601 --> 00:48:07.511
And you’ll be amazed, it is something a
grace that people get it.

00:48:07.511 --> 00:48:12.601
In Turkey, we have about two thousand people
who are realized souls.

00:48:12.601 --> 00:48:20.461
Nobody lost their life, not a single thing,
not their houses were even, they just little

00:48:20.461 --> 00:48:25.881
bit, I would say, shook but never fell down.

00:48:25.881 --> 00:48:28.221
The whole Orissa, it happened the same.

00:48:28.221 --> 00:48:36.231
It has happened in several places that people
have been just saved with those who have been

00:48:36.231 --> 00:48:39.171
in the grace of the Divine.

00:48:39.171 --> 00:48:40.571
We have to become that.

00:48:40.571 --> 00:48:42.631
We can’t live without it.

00:48:42.631 --> 00:48:43.861
It’s rather subtle.

00:48:43.861 --> 00:48:50.001
It is subtle, I know but sometimes must understand
we have to be subtle.

00:48:50.001 --> 00:49:00.481
Now as it is, so much of illness, sickness
I find, mostly I find with all the people

00:49:00.481 --> 00:49:03.781
who are working very hard is the right sided
problem.

00:49:03.781 --> 00:49:05.071
Some sort of a right side.

00:49:05.071 --> 00:49:13.551
And it can be absolutely cured, absolutely
be under your control, and you can cure others

00:49:13.551 --> 00:49:14.551
also.

00:49:14.551 --> 00:49:20.691
This is such a blessing we have in this horrible
Kaliyuga.

00:49:20.691 --> 00:49:26.831
The worst times, they say, the worst and worst
that is the time is now and you see the effects

00:49:26.831 --> 00:49:27.831
of that.

00:49:27.831 --> 00:49:31.641
But in that only, the lotus of Sahaja Yoga
has come up.

00:49:31.641 --> 00:49:34.061
You don’t have to pay for it.

00:49:34.061 --> 00:49:36.101
That’s one thing you should know.

00:49:36.101 --> 00:49:40.011
Anybody asks money from you, he’s not Divine.

00:49:40.011 --> 00:49:42.431
Don’t have to pay for it, at all.

00:49:42.431 --> 00:49:49.191
When you grow and when you achieve, when you
give Realizations to others, then you will

00:49:49.191 --> 00:49:55.411
be surprised you rise into a new realm of
understanding which is a doubtless awareness

00:49:55.411 --> 00:50:01.491
which is called as ‘Nirvikalpa Samadhi’
according to Patanjali.

00:50:01.491 --> 00:50:07.151
Now as we have learnt English, I don’t think
we read much of the, our Indian scriptures

00:50:07.151 --> 00:50:08.461
and thing.

00:50:08.461 --> 00:50:17.011
But that also, those who read will go on praying
to one monde of statues, this, that, I mean

00:50:17.011 --> 00:50:24.411
just they are fanatically religious people,
wasting their life like that.

00:50:24.411 --> 00:50:29.661
The another side are the buddhivaadis what
you call are the intellectuals, you see.

00:50:29.661 --> 00:50:32.831
They are the much worst because they think
they have read everything.

00:50:32.831 --> 00:50:33.831
They know everything.

00:50:33.831 --> 00:50:34.831
Now what to tell them?

00:50:34.831 --> 00:50:36.551
It’s a very simple thing, they don’t want
to accept.

00:50:36.551 --> 00:50:40.301
You can’t tell them, “Take it straight.”

00:50:40.301 --> 00:50:45.501
You have to have it in the other way.

00:50:45.501 --> 00:50:51.741
So also to understand it, we should know we
have not known ourselves.

00:50:51.741 --> 00:50:56.701
We have to know ourselves and for knowing
ourselves, Kundalini awakening is the only

00:50:56.701 --> 00:50:59.521
way, as far as I know.

00:50:59.521 --> 00:51:07.662
And I hope you all will think about it and
come to our centers where Realization can

00:51:07.662 --> 00:51:08.662
be given.

00:51:08.662 --> 00:51:10.971
There are many centers we have got.

00:51:10.971 --> 00:51:16.671
You don’t have to pay any money, nothing,
but you come and relax.

00:51:16.671 --> 00:51:20.731
Relaxation is only possible after Self-Realization,
not before that.

00:51:20.731 --> 00:51:24.671
You’ll be surprised your aging will stop.

00:51:24.671 --> 00:51:27.501
I have no aging problem.

00:51:27.501 --> 00:51:29.411
My husband also has no aging problem.

00:51:29.411 --> 00:51:31.311
We don’t think of it.

00:51:31.311 --> 00:51:32.311
It’s over.

00:51:32.311 --> 00:51:35.511
Now, whenever one has to die, one will die.

00:51:35.511 --> 00:51:39.721
But till then we are not bothered.

00:51:39.721 --> 00:51:45.491
Anything that you do will have a special light
of the Divine.

00:51:45.491 --> 00:51:51.701
I bless you from My heart that you develop
this subtle things within yourself and you

00:51:51.701 --> 00:51:56.231
try to understand that so far you have not
known yourself.

00:51:56.231 --> 00:51:57.561
You have to know yourself.

00:51:57.561 --> 00:52:02.251
You don’t have to introspect and sit down
criticizing yourself, feeling guilty.

00:52:02.251 --> 00:52:03.651
No, not at all.

00:52:03.651 --> 00:52:08.631
Whatever has happened has happened because
you’ll be amazed at yourself that all your

00:52:08.631 --> 00:52:12.321
destructive habits also will drop out by themselves.

00:52:12.321 --> 00:52:17.981
Overnight in London, there were twelve boys
with the addiction of drugs.

00:52:17.981 --> 00:52:22.431
They stopped over night, over night.

00:52:22.431 --> 00:52:23.871
I don’t, never told them.

00:52:23.871 --> 00:52:25.891
I never tell people, “Don’t, don’t.”

00:52:25.891 --> 00:52:27.421
I never say that.

00:52:27.421 --> 00:52:35.831
But that Kundalini rises and the light of
the, your heart, light of the Spirit, that

00:52:35.831 --> 00:52:37.221
guides you.

00:52:37.221 --> 00:52:39.811
That tells you what is destructive for you.

00:52:39.811 --> 00:52:44.971
And you have power not to accept anything
that is destructive.

00:52:44.971 --> 00:52:46.851
I know there are difficulties.

00:52:46.851 --> 00:52:50.691
I know there are problems but you’ll never
see them.

00:52:50.691 --> 00:52:55.411
If you are sitting in a boat, you are not
be bothered as to how deep the sea is.

00:52:55.411 --> 00:52:56.631
It’s like that.

00:52:56.631 --> 00:53:01.851
You rise above all these things and you watch
and you help others.

00:53:01.851 --> 00:53:05.541
Apart from that, it helps you in your work,
very much in your work.

00:53:05.541 --> 00:53:10.571
You understand your work very well because
of torsion area again.

00:53:10.571 --> 00:53:13.730
My husband says, “How do You get this idea?”

00:53:13.730 --> 00:53:14.890
I say, “I got it.

00:53:14.890 --> 00:53:18.761
All right this is the idea, I’ve got it.”

00:53:18.761 --> 00:53:21.640
Now he’s amazed sometimes how I manage things.

00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:22.640
How I am doing?

00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:23.980
I have no secretariat.

00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:25.570
I have no secretary.

00:53:25.570 --> 00:53:28.041
I have no P.A., nothing.

00:53:28.041 --> 00:53:30.830
And we are working in 86 countries.

00:53:30.830 --> 00:53:38.490
So it is just works out because it is this
Divine power which is so helpful or which

00:53:38.580 --> 00:53:40.260
is so kind.

00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:43.820
So again and again, I wish you best of luck.

00:53:43.890 --> 00:53:45.930
Please come to our centers.

00:53:46.030 --> 00:53:49.270
I hope they’ll give you the addresses and
all that and you

00:53:49.450 --> 00:53:53.020
can come on Saturdays or Sundays, whenever

00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:55.700
you want to and get your Realization.

00:53:55.990 --> 00:53:58.490
May God bless you!
