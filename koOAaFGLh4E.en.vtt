Shivaratri Puja, Pune (India)

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:02.700
16 March 2003

00:02:42.513 --> 00:02:57.963
Today we are going to worship Shri Shiva, Sadashiva.

00:03:01.263 --> 00:03:08.463
His quality is that He is forgiveness personified.

00:03:11.763 --> 00:03:15.463
The amount of forgiveness He has,

00:03:15.763 --> 00:03:19.173
has helped many of us to exist,

00:03:19.173 --> 00:03:23.883
otherwise this world would have perished,

00:03:24.173 --> 00:03:27.303
so many would have been finished

00:03:27.593 --> 00:03:33.173
because you know what is the condition of human beings.

00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:37.883
They don't understand what is wrong, what is right.

00:03:38.173 --> 00:03:43.463
Apart from that, they cannot forgive.

00:03:44.803 --> 00:03:47.673
They go on making mistakes- doesn't matter.

00:03:47.963 --> 00:03:51.173
But they cannot forgive others.

00:03:51.463 --> 00:03:58.593
This is what we have to learn from Shri Sadashiva.

00:04:03.883 --> 00:04:12.883
Today we are going to worship Shri Sadashiva.

00:04:13.883 --> 00:04:24.383
He is the embodiment of forgiveness, so powerful that

00:04:24.963 --> 00:04:31.803
nobody is able to be against him, to challenge him.

00:04:32.883 --> 00:04:42.173
He forgives all our mistakes, no matter what they are.

00:04:43.093 --> 00:04:46.303
If he does not, he could banish the world because

00:04:46.593 --> 00:04:49.673
within him there is a destructive power which

00:04:51.173 --> 00:04:53.963
is able to ruin the entire creation.

00:04:55.303 --> 00:05:02.963
Although forgiveness is his inherent quality

00:05:04.303 --> 00:05:08.963
this power of destruction could be awakened within him as well.

00:05:11.303 --> 00:05:15.303
His power of forgiveness increases gradually until it

00:05:16.593 --> 00:05:20.093
becomes mature and then finally he is able to destroy.

00:05:23.383 --> 00:05:28.963
So first of all we need to acquire his quality of forgiveness.

00:05:30.593 --> 00:05:36.093
We as human beings are capable of forgiving to some

00:05:36.383 --> 00:05:42.803
extent but, nevertheless we get angry and are ready to quarrel.

00:05:44.093 --> 00:05:51.803
But now He, who is the embodiment of forgiveness itself,

00:05:52.963 --> 00:05:58.713
reaches the point where his destructive power

00:05:59.303 --> 00:06:00.883
could be awakened?

00:06:05.093 --> 00:06:10.883
How does that happen?

00:06:11.803 --> 00:06:14.303
Once his power is awakened,

00:06:14.593 --> 00:06:17.593
he is able to banish even himself,

00:06:17.963 --> 00:06:24.713
the whole universe and every creation he has already created.

00:06:25.013 --> 00:06:30.923
So people should remember that in case we have not

00:06:32.093 --> 00:06:35.593
learned to forgive and forgiveness is not established

00:06:36.593 --> 00:06:42.713
within us, this destructive power will be awakened one day.

00:06:43.923 --> 00:06:46.803
And then we will destroy even our own people.

00:06:49.713 --> 00:06:53.423
That's why you should always keep in mind

00:06:54.713 --> 00:06:59.013
that there is no need to get angry

00:07:00.513 --> 00:07:05.923
with others in vain.

00:07:07.513 --> 00:07:11.303
You have absolutely no right to be angry with others.

00:07:15.013 --> 00:07:20.133
If Shiva is not doing so why should you?

00:07:20.803 --> 00:07:27.133
But people get angry extremely often and very heavily.

00:07:28.303 --> 00:07:34.713
Animals never get angry to such an extent.

00:07:35.713 --> 00:07:38.923
They won't get annoyed without any reason.

00:07:39.513 --> 00:07:43.713
Thus while getting angry at small things

00:07:45.013 --> 00:07:51.213
we should always remember that

00:07:52.013 --> 00:07:56.133
the power of Shri Shiva exists within us as well.

00:07:56.423 --> 00:08:03.713
Forgetting that Shiva exists within us is exactly what

00:08:04.513 --> 00:08:11.713
makes us get angry with people

00:08:12.013 --> 00:08:20.423
and unable to forgive their faults and mistakes.

00:08:21.843 --> 00:08:26.423
But what makes us act like this

00:08:26.713 --> 00:08:31.343
and what can such a person achieve?

00:08:31.633 --> 00:08:37.343
Wherever and whenever big events and occasions

00:08:38.513 --> 00:08:44.713
have occurred men have started to destroy

00:08:46.513 --> 00:08:52.343
other people out of pride and arrogance.

00:08:53.013 --> 00:09:00.343
This destructive power was even stronger in the past when

00:09:00.713 --> 00:09:07.843
people were banishing each other without any reason.

00:09:08.513 --> 00:09:14.513
We do not need to think about where

00:09:14.843 --> 00:09:19.633
has this attitude come from and why.

00:09:19.923 --> 00:09:25.513
The only thing we need to remember is not to fix

00:09:26.713 --> 00:09:33.053
our attention on such an inferior thing.

00:09:34.713 --> 00:09:43.713
If we could live in peace, if we could be able

00:09:44.053 --> 00:09:48.553
to see the peace in every single thing,

00:09:48.843 --> 00:09:54.713
we would be capable of making our lives peaceful too.

00:09:55.053 --> 00:10:01.133
But the point is that human beings

00:10:01.423 --> 00:10:06.553
are not able to control themselves.

00:10:07.423 --> 00:10:14.713
Moreover, they feel pleased getting angry with

00:10:15.053 --> 00:10:21.423
someone and giving punishment,

00:10:21.763 --> 00:10:29.263
to such an extent that even countries could be involved.

00:10:30.133 --> 00:10:34.843
If a person starts to quarrel with another one

00:10:35.263 --> 00:10:41.763
from a different country, all the people go behind him

00:10:42.133 --> 00:10:45.843
and nobody thinks of discussing, everyone is ready to fight.

00:10:46.423 --> 00:10:50.553
This inclination of human beings is very strange.

00:10:51.463 --> 00:10:54.133
How could one feel happy

00:10:54.763 --> 00:10:58.463
because of getting angry withsomeone,

00:10:59.053 --> 00:11:03.053
suppression, fighting

00:11:03.343 --> 00:11:08.343
or killing someone?

00:11:09.133 --> 00:11:13.053
But you can see for yourself.

00:11:13.343 --> 00:11:17.263
Imagine that while travelling on

00:11:17.633 --> 00:11:24.843
the road you see a crowd gathered.

00:11:25.553 --> 00:11:28.963
What are you going to do?

00:11:30.263 --> 00:11:37.763
Some of you will join the crowd, but some will just watch.

00:11:38.263 --> 00:11:44.553
Sometimes such strange outbursts

00:11:44.843 --> 00:11:47.343
in our temper are a sign that

00:11:47.673 --> 00:11:52.463
the power of Shri Shiva inside us comes out.

00:11:55.463 --> 00:11:58.263
By worshipping this power heartily human anger

00:11:58.553 --> 00:12:00.673
and wrath could be banished.

00:12:00.963 --> 00:12:06.263
It is considered an auspicious thing that

00:12:06.843 --> 00:12:16.553
even Shri Krishna has done this greatest feat out of anger.

00:12:17.343 --> 00:12:25.263
All the things were born out of anger, the whole creation.

00:12:25.843 --> 00:12:30.963
But you people are very proud with what you've done

00:12:31.343 --> 00:12:35.843
and consider yourself very powerful because of that.

00:12:36.053 --> 00:12:42.463
I am very angry with you about that.

00:12:42.763 --> 00:12:50.173
I can not see the beauty of humanity in your behaviour.

00:12:50.463 --> 00:12:57.673
To get angry for small things is a very typical thing.

00:12:58.263 --> 00:13:02.343
You get angry very easily

00:13:02.763 --> 00:13:10.463
and are not able to find an excuse for someone's faults.

00:13:10.763 --> 00:13:18.463
But this anger can cause many troubles - wars can begin,

00:13:18.763 --> 00:13:25.343
homes can be ruined and countries can be banished.

00:13:25.553 --> 00:13:27.963
With every passing day I can see human anger

00:13:28.553 --> 00:13:35.173
and wrath not decreasing but increasing

00:13:35.383 --> 00:13:38.963
and people proclaiming it with pride.

00:13:39.383 --> 00:13:42.673
I know you want Me to speak in English language, only.

00:13:45.553 --> 00:13:50.263
But people who don't know English are outnumbering you.

00:13:51.963 --> 00:13:53.673
What I'm trying to say,

00:13:54.553 --> 00:13:57.763
that it's very important

00:13:58.053 --> 00:14:02.963
to understand when you are worshipping Shri Shivashankar

00:14:03.553 --> 00:14:09.763
that He is the complete embodiment of forgiveness.

00:14:10.553 --> 00:14:12.463
He forgives.

00:14:13.093 --> 00:14:15.883
He forgives everything very sweetly.

00:14:17.463 --> 00:14:20.963
As one would forgive all small children.

00:14:22.093 --> 00:14:23.263
He forgives.

00:14:23.963 --> 00:14:25.463
He doesn't get angry.

00:14:26.763 --> 00:14:31.263
He's not that easily perturbed.

00:14:32.963 --> 00:14:38.093
Also we have certain amount of prejudices.

00:14:39.093 --> 00:14:43.383
For example, a woman in India,

00:14:44.963 --> 00:14:49.593
if she speaks, then people don't like it.

00:14:50.883 --> 00:14:53.463
A woman should not speak, a man can speak.

00:14:54.803 --> 00:14:57.593
And a woman can never beat

00:14:58.463 --> 00:15:00.883
- a woman can never beat a man,

00:15:01.803 --> 00:15:04.383
even if the man kills the wife.

00:15:05.463 --> 00:15:09.173
That is the criteria of a good wife in India, or a good woman.

00:15:10.303 --> 00:15:15.173
So you can imagine how men are getting towards their discretion.

00:15:16.673 --> 00:15:20.673
All this kind of concession that is given,

00:15:20.883 --> 00:15:27.803
is very dangerous, is the destructive of the whole community.

00:15:29.303 --> 00:15:31.593
Same I've seen abroad.

00:15:32.883 --> 00:15:35.803
There are people who go on beating their wives,

00:15:36.093 --> 00:15:38.673
killing their wives - I don't know all kinds of things.

00:15:38.963 --> 00:15:43.383
Because they have married somebody,
they think they have every right

00:15:43.673 --> 00:15:46.963
to expect everything good from their wives,

00:15:47.673 --> 00:15:50.383
while they may not be at all good,

00:15:51.173 --> 00:15:54.303
and they go on torturing their wives.

00:15:55.303 --> 00:15:58.593
Not only that but in the school, the teachers,

00:15:59.803 --> 00:16:03.803
they ill-treat the students so badly, the students pick it up.

00:16:04.883 --> 00:16:09.803
And later on they carry on the tradition

00:16:10.383 --> 00:16:13.513
of beating others and troubling others.

00:16:14.513 --> 00:16:17.513
So every time you say, "I get very angry,"

00:16:18.303 --> 00:16:23.213
tell yourself you are on the wrong path.

00:16:24.093 --> 00:16:27.303
I've told so many times to so many of you

00:16:28.593 --> 00:16:35.213
that to boast of your anger is the worst thing because

00:16:35.593 --> 00:16:46.093
it is like boasting about your sins you are committing.

00:16:47.383 --> 00:16:50.213
These are the sins.

00:16:50.713 --> 00:16:53.593
I can understand some people who are drunkards,

00:16:54.923 --> 00:17:00.963
or some who are mad, or some who are out of their minds

00:17:01.803 --> 00:17:05.963
- but a mad person you'll find very, very sensible otherwise,

00:17:06.923 --> 00:17:14.213
can be very ferocious, can be very dangerous.

00:17:15.013 --> 00:17:21.423
It is difficult to say from where do you get these qualities,

00:17:22.923 --> 00:17:27.213
because none of the Divine Personalities

00:17:27.923 --> 00:17:29.803
had this kind of thing.

00:17:30.593 --> 00:17:35.213
For no rhyme and reason They won't lose their temper

00:17:35.803 --> 00:17:40.803
and even if They do, it has to be a very strong

00:17:41.133 --> 00:17:43.713
reason up to the point of destruction.

00:17:45.213 --> 00:17:47.633
But I can understand Them,

00:17:48.513 --> 00:17:52.633
because They have to maintain this world

00:17:53.633 --> 00:17:55.713
and They have to look after

00:17:57.513 --> 00:18:02.303
the people who are supposed to be human beings.

00:18:03.303 --> 00:18:08.213
But sometimes I've seen human beings are

00:18:08.513 --> 00:18:10.213
even worse than animals.

00:18:11.423 --> 00:18:13.513
They get provoked for nothing at all.

00:18:14.633 --> 00:18:17.013
What is the reason? Why are you angry?

00:18:18.633 --> 00:18:23.513
They'll give you an excuse which is absolutely unreasonable.

00:18:25.133 --> 00:18:32.133
In this world you have come to enjoy peace and joy.

00:18:33.423 --> 00:18:35.633
Without peace, you can't have joy.

00:18:37.513 --> 00:18:41.133
If you cannot give peace to others, how can you have joy?

00:18:41.843 --> 00:18:48.633
And the way people treat others in such a contemptuous manner,

00:18:49.213 --> 00:18:52.633
it's very surprising, what do they think of themselves?

00:18:53.513 --> 00:18:58.923
Why should they think so low about other people?

00:19:00.423 --> 00:19:08.053
It's beyond understanding to see a man losing temper

00:19:08.213 --> 00:19:10.553
on small, small things.

00:19:13.553 --> 00:19:15.713
But actually they are cowards.

00:19:17.053 --> 00:19:21.713
If it comes to some facing some real problem in life,

00:19:23.053 --> 00:19:27.423
they recede back. Then they cannot come forward.

00:19:28.213 --> 00:19:33.133
This is the biggest tragedy of the whole thing.

00:19:36.713 --> 00:19:42.553
In our country hot-tempered people are very well known too.

00:19:43.553 --> 00:19:48.213
In the villages they call them tetchy or naggers, or flares-up.

00:19:48.553 --> 00:19:51.553
Nobody likes to live with them.

00:19:51.843 --> 00:19:58.763
All right. Imagine that someone has done a mistake. Forgive him!

00:19:58.923 --> 00:20:06.633
If somebody has done something very wrong, forgive him

00:20:07.133 --> 00:20:11.923
because tomorrow you could be in the same situation.

00:20:14.343 --> 00:20:16.423
And then someone could come and ask you questions

00:20:17.053 --> 00:20:18.923
and you could be given a punishment.

00:20:19.263 --> 00:20:28.263
So you should understand that as Sahaja yogis

00:20:28.553 --> 00:20:37.343
you have  absolutely no right to preach and punish anybody.

00:20:38.423 --> 00:20:43.423
You have to respect Shri Shiva.
This is the right thing to be done.

00:20:43.763 --> 00:20:48.263
So one has the nature of Shri Shiva within himself,

00:20:48.553 --> 00:20:52.553
one is on the right path and is protected by Shri Shiva.

00:20:53.343 --> 00:20:58.843
Those who have open hearted

00:20:59.763 --> 00:21:02.553
and fair have nothing to be concerned about.

00:21:03.463 --> 00:21:09.553
Shri Shivshankar looks after them and takes care of them.

00:21:11.133 --> 00:21:15.263
If it is so, then why do you need to get angry at all?

00:21:20.763 --> 00:21:22.053
That's very strange.

00:21:23.133 --> 00:21:28.763
All the time you trust other people for your good prospects.

00:21:30.133 --> 00:21:32.843
And at the same time,

00:21:33.553 --> 00:21:36.963
you are not able  to forgive anything which is wrong.

00:21:38.633 --> 00:21:44.843
When somebody has made a mistake

00:21:45.263 --> 00:21:49.263
you wish that he would be ruined.

00:21:49.553 --> 00:21:54.673
Unless and until you overcome this desire,

00:21:54.963 --> 00:22:01.463
you will not be able to understand your real nature.

00:22:01.843 --> 00:22:08.763
And you won't be able to answer the question.

00:22:09.053 --> 00:22:14.673
"Are you a human or an animal?"

00:22:15.463 --> 00:22:22.343
Animals never get angry without reason.

00:22:23.463 --> 00:22:26.343
The power of Shivaji is very strong inside them.

00:22:27.173 --> 00:22:33.463
But man is exactly the one who is able

00:22:35.053 --> 00:22:38.763
to completely destroy all human beings.

00:22:39.883 --> 00:22:43.383
He reckons he has the right to destroy

00:22:43.673 --> 00:22:48.263
hundreds of thousands of people. Such a man was Hitler.

00:22:48.553 --> 00:22:54.763
He killed so many people without even creating a small child

00:22:56.263 --> 00:22:58.463
Who did he think he was?

00:22:58.763 --> 00:23:02.963
The families of all these people have also bee ruined

00:23:03.263 --> 00:23:07.053
and their countries were destroyed too.

00:23:08.053 --> 00:23:09.463
Who did that man think he was?

00:23:09.763 --> 00:23:14.883
There were a few more people like him in the world

00:23:15.963 --> 00:23:21.763
but you do not need to follow his example.

00:23:22.673 --> 00:23:28.553
You are Sahaja Yogis so you have to forgive.

00:23:29.093 --> 00:23:32.763
Fair and open-hearted people are capable of forgiving.

00:23:33.263 --> 00:23:36.173
Their quality of forgiveness is very strong.

00:23:36.463 --> 00:23:40.763
But the very embodiment of forgiveness

00:23:41.263 --> 00:23:46.463
is Shri Shivashankar.

00:23:46.763 --> 00:23:52.963
That's why He is the supreme one.

00:23:53.463 --> 00:23:56.673
He doesn't need any property.

00:23:57.093 --> 00:24:00.593
He can wear any clothing,

00:24:01.093 --> 00:24:03.383
but if he hasn't got any,

00:24:03.593 --> 00:24:08.303
he would simply put some ash to cover his body.

00:24:08.593 --> 00:24:11.803
He can live and survive in any circumstances.

00:24:13.383 --> 00:24:15.463
He has no need of anything.

00:24:18.383 --> 00:24:20.383
But is someone feels wrath

00:24:20.673 --> 00:24:24.673
and tortures somebody,

00:24:25.673 --> 00:24:29.673
finally Shri Shiva will destroy him.

00:24:30.303 --> 00:24:34.303
His power of forgiveness is as strong as his power of destruction.

00:24:35.303 --> 00:24:37.463
Why is it so?

00:24:38.303 --> 00:24:43.463
Because when a man sees somebody being oppressed,

00:24:44.593 --> 00:24:47.383
he should feel pity and should know

00:24:47.673 --> 00:24:50.093
that if someone dares to behave like this

00:24:50.883 --> 00:24:56.963
- oppressing others, he will be finished soon.

00:24:57.673 --> 00:25:02.963
Today not many people dare to act like this.

00:25:03.803 --> 00:25:09.593
In the past there were many more.

00:25:10.173 --> 00:25:19.513
They were famous for having tortured
and killed lots of people,

00:25:20.593 --> 00:25:27.593
and having interfered in many countries and destroying them.

00:25:28.173 --> 00:25:33.303
But today, nobody hangs their pictures on the wall,

00:25:33.963 --> 00:25:38.213
nobody remembers them,
nobody worships them as idols.

00:25:38.593 --> 00:25:43.803
Nobody remembers their faces either.

00:25:44.093 --> 00:25:47.093
You do not need to build such a temper.

00:25:47.383 --> 00:25:52.803
You'd better try to understand that if you are hot-tempered,

00:25:53.593 --> 00:25:59.383
people might obey you out of fear.

00:25:59.803 --> 00:26:04.593
But you will be pleased with something

00:26:04.883 --> 00:26:07.303
done under a threat?

00:26:07.593 --> 00:26:12.713
And what is so special about that?

00:26:13.383 --> 00:26:19.713
Consider for yourself how many people

00:26:19.963 --> 00:26:24.513
have you been  angry with in this world

00:26:25.593 --> 00:26:28.213
and how many people you have destroyed?

00:26:28.593 --> 00:26:34.923
How many people you have quarrelled with?

00:26:35.513 --> 00:26:43.923
There are some people whose dharma is to be wrathful

00:26:44.213 --> 00:26:48.093
and to quarrel for small things all the time.

00:26:48.423 --> 00:26:50.513
Hey will argue with someone in the morning,

00:26:51.423 --> 00:26:56.093
with someone else in the afternoon

00:26:57.213 --> 00:27:00.923
and with someone else in the evening.

00:27:01.513 --> 00:27:05.513
People keep away from such individuals.

00:27:05.803 --> 00:27:07.923
They will even cross the street in order

00:27:08.633 --> 00:27:11.803
to avoid such a quarrel some person.

00:27:12.213 --> 00:27:17.633
All this can be overcome only through pure love.

00:27:18.423 --> 00:27:21.133
Sahaja yoga is the pure love

00:27:22.303 --> 00:27:30.213
and we have Jesus Christ as a great example to follow.

00:27:31.303 --> 00:27:36.133
If we have established within us the quality of forgiveness

00:27:38.423 --> 00:27:43.213
to the same extent as Christ has, we will be able to realize

00:27:43.513 --> 00:27:50.923
the true nature of Shri Shiva and acquire his qualities.

00:27:51.713 --> 00:27:54.013
To get angry with someone is not unusual at all.

00:27:54.843 --> 00:28:00.713
That's why today all of you have to consider for yourself

00:28:01.713 --> 00:28:08.633
- do you wish to destroy some other people

00:28:09.213 --> 00:28:13.923
and living creatures and to what extent?

00:28:15.343 --> 00:28:21.013
As Sahaja Yogis, you should completely give up this

00:28:21.633 --> 00:28:26.713
because it is useless and it isn't worth doing.

00:28:27.343 --> 00:28:30.343
Today while worshipping Shri Shiva,

00:28:30.633 --> 00:28:35.633
you people make a decision not to

00:28:36.343 --> 00:28:41.633
get angry in any situation.

00:28:41.923 --> 00:28:44.053
If it makes no sense,

00:28:44.343 --> 00:28:48.423
why do you need to feel wrath?

00:28:49.553 --> 00:28:55.053
You doing that will just make you feel worse.

00:28:55.343 --> 00:29:00.843
So today, let us all worship Shri Shiva

00:29:01.133 --> 00:29:05.343
and pray for acquiring his qualities.

00:29:05.633 --> 00:29:07.923
May God bless you.
