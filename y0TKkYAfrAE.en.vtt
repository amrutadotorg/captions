00:00:00.063 --> 00:00:06.515
[subtitle begins at 13:52, when She speaks
in Marathi]

00:13:52.983 --> 00:13:58.429
I was telling about Shivaji Maharaj because
he had established Satara as the capital.

00:13:58.946 --> 00:14:02.992
We must adopt
the qualities that he possessed.

00:14:03.992 --> 00:14:07.050
The special trait about
him was that he had no

00:14:07.075 --> 00:14:09.655
faults, that we
have as a human being,like

00:14:09.905 --> 00:14:16.305
someone has bad habit, someone
has addiction, someone's is crazy about and runs after somebody.

00:14:16.305 --> 00:14:19.505
This prooves that he was, an anshavatar.

00:14:19.505 --> 00:14:25.401
As he was an anshavatar, he didn't have any bad habit like lieing, drinking alcohol etc.

00:14:25.401 --> 00:14:28.401
Was not needed to tell him. He was simply not like that.

00:14:28.655 --> 00:14:30.965
Second, his temperament was very sweet,

00:14:31.215 --> 00:14:32.215
he was very sweet.

00:14:32.615 --> 00:14:37.615
Extremely sweet and
totally surrendered to his mother.

00:14:38.374 --> 00:14:42.374
He never uttered a bad word to anyone or shouted at anyone,

00:14:42.374 --> 00:14:44.424
or got angry with anyone.

00:14:44.424 --> 00:14:46.074
These two qualities are very difficult to find.

00:14:46.324 --> 00:14:50.724
When a person has such a great mother's blessing…

00:14:50.724 --> 00:14:56.724
and even more importance this
blessing gets, because he was a king.

00:14:57.724 --> 00:15:01.224
But still he was very sweet in nature.

00:15:02.534 --> 00:15:05.559
He didn´t think too highly of himself saying,

00:15:05.584 --> 00:15:09.984
'I am a king. They are poor or they
are mawlas. How can I talk to them?

00:15:09.984 --> 00:15:12.844
He used to sit with them, take food with them.

00:15:12.984 --> 00:15:15.154
He was having fun to eat
onion and bhakri(maharashtrian Millet bread) with them.

00:15:15.644 --> 00:15:17.544
Night and day he used to travel riding on his horse,

00:15:17.544 --> 00:15:19.544
sleep anywhere at night.

00:15:19.944 --> 00:15:20.944
do anything.

00:15:21.094 --> 00:15:22.594
That is how he spent his life.

00:15:22.594 --> 00:15:26.954
He had very gruelling, hard working life and he suffered a lot.

00:15:27.204 --> 00:15:30.204
After that, when Sambhaji
Maharaj and Shahu Maharaj (his two sons)got

00:15:30.204 --> 00:15:33.704
into a dispute, the only reason
for that was sibling rivalry.

00:15:33.754 --> 00:15:36.304
It is the nature of our Marathas.

00:15:36.804 --> 00:15:40.354
this is very deep conditioning inside us without
wich we can't do anything,

00:15:40.354 --> 00:15:42.214
But we are not ready to accept

00:15:42.214 --> 00:15:44.364
that we have sibling rivalry in us.

00:15:44.464 --> 00:15:46.364
We are not ready to
listen to this thing,

00:15:46.364 --> 00:15:48.897
But this is very deep rooted
in us. So be aware of it!

00:15:49.524 --> 00:15:51.564
I observe this one upmanship even
in Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:51.814 --> 00:15:53.747
Its everywhere, wherever we go.

00:15:54.074 --> 00:15:56.874
This is one of the shortcomings in Maharashtra.

00:15:56.924 --> 00:16:00.074
We lost a kingdom because
of this sibling rivalry,

00:16:00.074 --> 00:16:02.874
due to which now we should not
lose the kingdom of God anymore.

00:16:03.874 --> 00:16:07.124
People who are doing God´s work
should be kept together,

00:16:07.521 --> 00:16:09.821
should not break anyone.
Don't speak harsh to others.

00:16:10.071 --> 00:16:12.471
This was not Shivaji Maharaj´s style.

00:16:13.583 --> 00:16:16.083
He always gave importance to
those who did some work.

00:16:17.083 --> 00:16:23.483
You know, when he got a Sinhgad, he said,
'We won the fort but lost the lion´.

00:16:23.983 --> 00:16:25.393
That's a very big deal.

00:16:25.643 --> 00:16:28.893
`What if we got a fort,
but we lost a brave warrior!´

00:16:29.143 --> 00:16:33.493
And from his behavior,
we all have to learn that

00:16:33.493 --> 00:16:37.943
also in sahajyoga it is very important to
value another person.

00:16:38.243 --> 00:16:39.753
Do not praise only yourself.

00:16:39.753 --> 00:16:43.293
I'm special, I'm particular, I'm
everything.Don't do this.

00:16:43.293 --> 00:16:45.401
Many people think that they are educated.

00:16:45.401 --> 00:16:48.003
In sahajyoga many people are
comfortably well off and educated.

00:16:48.051 --> 00:16:51.118
So they don't mix with people with less privilaged section of society. This is wrong.

00:16:51.956 --> 00:16:53.801
They are different from us, we are different,

00:16:53.834 --> 00:16:55.664
They should live separate
we should stay apart from them.

00:16:55.664 --> 00:16:58.997
If you feel that way, then
you haven´t yet understood sahajyoga.

00:16:59.114 --> 00:17:02.914
Yogies don't have cast or creed, high or low class mentality at all.

00:17:02.914 --> 00:17:07.314
Sahaj yogies should not even differenciate on basis of rich and poor.

00:17:07.314 --> 00:17:08.864
Only then you will be a yogy.

00:17:08.864 --> 00:17:12.764
So, the identity of the
yogies is that we are all one.

00:17:12.764 --> 00:17:17.124
We are all children of one mother.
There should be no difference between us.

00:17:17.124 --> 00:17:18.674
There should be equality in us.

00:17:20.123 --> 00:17:22.073
If we want to change our country,

00:17:22.097 --> 00:17:27.073
as we have seen an example of Shivaji,

00:17:28.222 --> 00:17:31.972
there should be no flaws in ourselves.

00:17:31.982 --> 00:17:35.388
If a person has his own flaws,
what will he be able to preach others?

00:17:35.388 --> 00:17:40.733
Secondly, those who followed
him had an immense faith in him.

00:17:40.783 --> 00:17:45.283
It is wrong all the time just
to argue with and find faults in your leaders.

00:17:45.283 --> 00:17:48.343
If both things are reconciled,
then only sibling rivalry won´t exist.

00:17:48.343 --> 00:17:52.076
But if not,
then the rivalry thrives.

00:17:52.993 --> 00:17:55.943
It is very wrong to talk harsh.

00:17:55.949 --> 00:18:01.049
But it is also wrong not to
respect your leader, constantly to

00:18:01.054 --> 00:18:05.387
humiliate him, to correct
him as such, to teach him.

00:18:06.804 --> 00:18:13.154
So if we manage these two things then
sibling rivalry in our country will end.

00:18:13.664 --> 00:18:16.154
It must vanish. It should be uprooted completely.

00:18:16.154 --> 00:18:19.621
It won´t work looking at other's faults,
first try to remove faults from yourself.

00:18:19.964 --> 00:18:26.114
I am speaking this in satara as in Satara only Swarajya was established

00:18:26.114 --> 00:18:30.814
and in Satara only its disintegration began.

00:18:30.814 --> 00:18:33.515
So both things must be kept in mind.

00:18:33.564 --> 00:18:37.074
There should be no anarchic behaviur
within us. This is the act of love.

00:18:37.329 --> 00:18:39.062
We should conect people through love.

00:18:39.374 --> 00:18:43.525
Whatever other ideas and all the stuff
people do (is not proper), like some are intellectuals and

00:18:43.525 --> 00:18:46.024
so they get away from others.

00:18:46.385 --> 00:18:48.824
You should live on the power of love.

00:18:49.035 --> 00:18:52.335
Love is the food of sahajyoga.

00:18:52.985 --> 00:18:54.985
We need to see, how much do we love others?

00:18:54.985 --> 00:18:59.485
how much we
give to others, rather than find faults in them.

00:19:00.885 --> 00:19:04.395
Thats why both things
should be used with care.

00:19:04.395 --> 00:19:08.509
I'm so happy that this
work now started in Satara.

00:19:08.945 --> 00:19:13.845
I felt very nice yesterday. Lots of
seekers were there and many got their realisation.

00:19:13.845 --> 00:19:17.105
In Sahajyoga grand work is to be done and many will achieve great heights,

00:19:17.105 --> 00:19:20.605
Those sitting here are the leaders of the future.

00:19:20.605 --> 00:19:22.805
So it was very pleasing to me.

00:19:22.805 --> 00:19:27.838
But we should keep in mind that
whatever mistakes were made earlier in politics

00:19:28.955 --> 00:19:32.965
should not be comitted again in the kingdom of God.

00:19:32.965 --> 00:19:36.715
The laws of the God's Kingdom
are very strong and very strict.

00:19:36.715 --> 00:19:40.715
The person who goes against
that law is straight away punished.

00:19:40.715 --> 00:19:42.215
We should be careful.

00:19:42.215 --> 00:19:44.215
Very careful.

00:19:44.465 --> 00:19:47.830
His blessings and forgiveness

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:51.975
are immense, but upto a limit.

00:19:51.975 --> 00:19:54.725
After that, his rath is severe.

00:19:54.725 --> 00:19:56.975
Then you won´t be able to do anything.

00:19:56.975 --> 00:20:01.071
So remember, now we are
entering into the kingdom of the God,

00:20:01.725 --> 00:20:09.975
So we should keep this wisdom not to bring wretched politics of any kind here.

00:20:10.085 --> 00:20:11.785
Don't bring this dirty thing here.

00:20:11.785 --> 00:20:15.685
In this kingdom of love, we all are
tied to each other by the same cord(of love).

00:20:15.685 --> 00:20:17.316
We are the children of the same mother.

00:20:17.935 --> 00:20:21.695
So the power we need to attain should not be
forced on others. Instead, aply it on your ownself.

00:20:21.695 --> 00:20:24.495
This is not a place to rule on others.

00:20:24.495 --> 00:20:27.995
One must understand that this is
the place to get mastery on yourself.

00:20:27.995 --> 00:20:32.545
If you gain that mastery, first thing, it
will manifest in your vibrations.

00:20:33.305 --> 00:20:37.055
According to your vibrations, I can
understand what is going on inside you

00:20:37.055 --> 00:20:39.855
How it is going and where its going haywire.

00:20:40.105 --> 00:20:46.255
So please don´t practice any type of sibling rivalry or form groups, and if done, break them.

00:20:46.255 --> 00:20:49.765
Mataji told, not to split in groups, not to talk against anyone.

00:20:49.765 --> 00:20:51.315
nor talk ill of anybody.

00:20:51.315 --> 00:20:53.815
Don't create groups.
Everyone should stay together.

00:20:55.065 --> 00:20:59.365
The thought came to me at
Satara, to make the people here now

00:20:59.365 --> 00:21:03.115
aware of it

00:21:03.115 --> 00:21:05.275
Because sahajyoga is very easy to get.

00:21:06.525 --> 00:21:12.175
And the first thing that happenes that one gets power,

00:21:12.175 --> 00:21:14.108
and with that, one tends to overpower others.

00:21:14.375 --> 00:21:21.375
Or others say, 'Why does this man do so much?

00:21:21.375 --> 00:21:22.875
That is also wrong.

00:21:22.875 --> 00:21:26.435
If one tries to supress others,
people think, who is he to do this?

00:21:26.435 --> 00:21:30.335
So in sahajyoga you should keep
in mind that Mataji has appointed

00:21:30.335 --> 00:21:33.385
one person everywhere.

00:21:33.409 --> 00:21:35.494
And She has communication with everyone.

00:21:36.835 --> 00:21:40.395
Through that appointment only She communicates (to all).

00:21:40.895 --> 00:21:44.645
Just like we have a brain in our
head that communicates with the whole body.

00:21:45.445 --> 00:21:47.945
Same is to be done in sahajyoga.

00:21:47.945 --> 00:21:53.505
So if anything goes wrong with that person,
I will notice it right away, I can fix him.

00:21:53.505 --> 00:21:56.655
But if you try to find faults in him,
you will ruin everything.

00:21:57.905 --> 00:22:00.055
Isn´t it, did you get the point?

00:22:00.305 --> 00:22:04.305
Accept a person who is your leader.

00:22:04.305 --> 00:22:09.215
I will keep an eye on him. If he makes a
mistake, I will know everything, of everyone.

00:22:11.015 --> 00:22:15.015
You don't know how well I
know this. Because I don't tell you,

00:22:15.015 --> 00:22:16.815
that doesn't mean I don't know.

00:22:16.815 --> 00:22:17.965
I know everybody.

00:22:17.965 --> 00:22:22.461
When we choose one person as a
leader, he must be accepted.

00:22:22.461 --> 00:22:25.961
Trust your Mataji, She will do the right.

00:22:25.961 --> 00:22:29.621
You may be more educated,
or you may have more money,

00:22:29.621 --> 00:22:31.671
or whatever you have, but don´t do anything.

00:22:32.071 --> 00:22:35.971
As long as I am okay with that person, accept him as your leader.

00:22:36.071 --> 00:22:40.071
Later on, if he does something
wrong, I´ll remove him.

00:22:42.731 --> 00:22:45.131
Keep this in mind that I myself know everything.

00:22:45.131 --> 00:22:46.881
Then sahajyoga is going to increase.

00:22:47.281 --> 00:22:53.432
As sahajyoga
has no organization,

00:22:53.432 --> 00:22:56.942
You don't have to pay
anything, there is no membership,

00:22:56.942 --> 00:22:58.349
then how will we be bonded?

00:22:59.842 --> 00:23:01.142
Through love.

00:23:01.142 --> 00:23:03.892
Everyone should get connected with love.

00:23:03.892 --> 00:23:08.642
And second thing is that the power
of love comes from Mataji.

00:23:08.642 --> 00:23:12.892
So believe in the person She
chose as a leader, accept him.

00:23:12.892 --> 00:23:17.425
And if I see anything wrong in
him, I will take him out.

00:23:17.852 --> 00:23:19.352
I will definately remove him.

00:23:19.352 --> 00:23:23.112
So you need to completely rely on me.

00:23:23.112 --> 00:23:25.162
How to develope

00:23:26.911 --> 00:23:28.161
our character?

00:23:28.911 --> 00:23:30.411
How should we act?

00:23:30.961 --> 00:23:34.211
To learn this,I'm right in front of you.

00:23:34.611 --> 00:23:38.361
If you think that we cannot be like
Mataji, then look at Shivaji Maharaj.

00:23:38.871 --> 00:23:41.521
We have so many people as examples

00:23:41.521 --> 00:23:43.921
Nothing is too difficult for those who
have realisation in sahjayoga.

00:23:43.921 --> 00:23:45.421
Life simply changes.

00:23:45.421 --> 00:23:47.321
Look at how much these
people have changed.

00:23:47.671 --> 00:23:50.371
they couldn't even sit on
the ground for five minutes.

00:23:50.621 --> 00:23:52.831
By hard work they
learned to sit on the ground.

00:23:57.125 --> 00:23:58.875
So meditation should be done properly.

00:24:00.122 --> 00:24:02.513
Every evening if you meditate atleast

00:24:02.538 --> 00:24:05.182
fifteen to twenty minutes
before going to sleep

00:24:05.182 --> 00:24:06.932
it helps to improve.

00:24:06.932 --> 00:24:12.842
And before going outside, or after the morning bath, if you do puja

00:24:12.842 --> 00:24:14.897
to the photo just for five minutes, it will do.

00:24:14.897 --> 00:24:17.892
But all should meet every week.

00:24:17.892 --> 00:24:20.392
If that is not the case,
sahajyoga simply doesn't work.

00:24:20.392 --> 00:24:25.642
Everyone should meet every week.
Because this is collective consciousness.

00:24:26.052 --> 00:24:29.602
If you say, “Mataji we kept a photo at home, we worship you at home.But still we have this problem.”

00:24:29.602 --> 00:24:31.652
My attention doesn´t go there.

00:24:32.152 --> 00:24:38.652
I told you yesterday, that when we
whip buttermilk, the butter comes out.

00:24:38.652 --> 00:24:42.312
We take out that sticks to the big lump and the rest all is thrown away.

00:24:42.312 --> 00:24:47.612
Similarly people who cling
to the colectivity come to me. The rest are not in my attention.

00:24:48.112 --> 00:24:50.662
Then you must go to the
place where others meet.

00:24:51.412 --> 00:24:54.662
There you may talk to people, may
discuss. But don´t do groupism.

00:24:54.662 --> 00:24:57.572
It will be better to talk less and meditate more.

00:24:57.662 --> 00:25:02.472
If there is groupism, or like, I will heal you, I
will fix you, I´ll put you in your place…

00:25:02.472 --> 00:25:05.272
If this kind of things start then you are a gone case.

00:25:05.634 --> 00:25:09.632
Everyone must go there
and meditate, sing Bhajans, do Aarti.

00:25:09.632 --> 00:25:12.132
If you have any issues, sort them out.

00:25:12.132 --> 00:25:17.932
But just sitting there don´t argue
with each other or do stupid things.

00:25:17.932 --> 00:25:25.382
Instead, focus on what you
want to gain in sahajyoga,

00:25:25.382 --> 00:25:30.142
What about our growth? How much we have grown in sahaj yoga, Where have we reached?

00:25:30.392 --> 00:25:37.442
I think,slowly sahaj yoga will settle in Maharashtra. But sometimes I get worried about future,

00:25:37.442 --> 00:25:40.242
that my hard work should not be wasted.

00:25:43.352 --> 00:25:46.602
It is important to remember that the responsibility of the whole world lies on you.

00:25:46.602 --> 00:25:50.152
The responsibility of the entire world
is on Maharashtrians.

00:25:50.152 --> 00:25:51.852
It should be kept in mind.

00:25:51.852 --> 00:25:58.502
And if you make it lose which is also posible for you. So don´t do that.

00:25:58.752 --> 00:26:02.262
Whatever faults are in us
must be removed.

00:26:03.012 --> 00:26:07.062
Develope sweetness in your nature. you Must talk with love with others.

00:26:07.062 --> 00:26:10.762
Everyone should be treated equaly.

00:26:10.862 --> 00:26:14.112
If this is done outside(in behavior),it
will reflect inside.

00:26:14.112 --> 00:26:16.612
Because now, inside out you have
become the same.

00:26:16.672 --> 00:26:20.672
Whatever you do outside(behavior), will impact
inside. Whatever you change inside will manifest outside.

00:26:20.722 --> 00:26:22.819
Because inside out you became the
same. This doesn´t happen normaly

00:26:22.844 --> 00:26:25.096
but now your conection is established.

00:26:26.322 --> 00:26:29.072
Now if this(Mike) is defective
outside, there is no sound

00:26:29.097 --> 00:26:31.596
and if there is damage from
inside(electricity)still no sound will be there.

00:26:31.832 --> 00:26:33.332
Both things should be in order.

00:26:33.332 --> 00:26:36.782
Many people say that we meditate,
mataji, our vibrations are ok.

00:26:36.782 --> 00:26:38.932
But it should manifest outside too.

00:26:38.932 --> 00:26:41.432
Otherwise, whatever is inside
will eventually disappear.

00:26:41.456 --> 00:26:46.542
Therefore, one must be
same both inside and outside

00:26:46.542 --> 00:26:49.492
And should look radient.

00:26:49.492 --> 00:26:55.242
But there should not be any scorching in that radiance.

00:26:55.242 --> 00:26:57.242
The personality should not be agressive.

00:26:57.242 --> 00:27:01.242
But it should be very mild,
beautiful and cool, like the moon.

00:27:03.742 --> 00:27:06.992
Next time when I come here, hope
there will be more people.

00:27:06.992 --> 00:27:10.492
And we will celebrate a puja all together.

00:27:10.492 --> 00:27:12.992
But this time I will not come.

00:27:13.262 --> 00:27:14.742
I will come next year.

00:27:14.912 --> 00:27:17.162
This time I will probably
stay here for one night.

00:27:17.162 --> 00:27:19.562
So, let's see if we can do something if possible.
