00:00.063 --> 00:06.515
[subtitle begins at 13:52, when She speaks
in Hindi]

13:52.999 --> 13:58.445
I was telling about Shivaji Maharaj because
he had established Satara as the capital.

13:58.946 --> 14:02.992
We must take into account
the qualities that he possess.

14:03.992 --> 14:07.050
The special trait about
him was that he has no

14:07.075 --> 14:09.655
faults, faults that we
have as a human being.

14:09.905 --> 14:16.305
Someone's has habit, someone's
has addiction, someone's is crazy about

14:16.305 --> 14:19.505
something. Because of this
its Prove that he was, an avatar.

14:19.505 --> 14:25.401
because he was a avatar, he doesn't have

14:25.401 --> 14:28.401
any bad habit like lying,drinking etc.

14:28.655 --> 14:30.965
Second, he was very sweet by nature.

14:31.215 --> 14:32.215
he was very sweet.

14:32.615 --> 14:37.615
Extremely sweet and
totally devoted to her mother.

14:38.374 --> 14:42.374
They never uttered a
word or shouted at anyone.

14:42.374 --> 14:44.424
he did not deteriorate on anyone.

14:44.424 --> 14:46.074
These two qualities are very difficult.

14:46.324 --> 14:50.724
When a man has a mother's blessing

14:50.724 --> 14:56.724
And even more important this
blessing is, Because he was a king.

14:57.724 --> 15:01.224
But he was still very sweet in by nature.

15:02.534 --> 15:05.559
he had no etiquette for himself saying,

15:05.584 --> 15:09.984
'I am a king. They are poor or they
are mawlas. How to talk to them?

15:09.984 --> 15:12.844
'Sitting with them, eating bread with them.

15:12.984 --> 15:15.154
They were having fun to eat
onion and bread with them.

15:15.644 --> 15:17.544
Night and day he ride on horseback.

15:17.544 --> 15:19.544
Sleep anywhere at night.

15:19.944 --> 15:20.944
Do anything.

15:21.094 --> 15:22.594
That is how he live his life.

15:22.594 --> 15:26.954
And he suffered a lot.

15:27.204 --> 15:30.204
After that, when Sambhaji
Maharaj and Shahu Maharaj got

15:30.204 --> 15:33.704
into a dispute, the only reason
for that was brother bondage.

15:33.754 --> 15:36.304
It is the nature of our Marathas.

15:36.804 --> 15:40.354
this is in our body Without
him we couldn't do anything,

15:40.354 --> 15:42.214
we are not ready to tolerate

15:42.214 --> 15:44.364
that brother bondage is in our body .

15:44.464 --> 15:46.364
we are not ready to
Listening to this thing,

15:46.364 --> 15:48.897
But this thing is very
much inside our body.

15:49.524 --> 15:51.564
I see brother bondage even
happening in Sahaja Yoga.

15:51.814 --> 15:53.747
There is a brother bondage in everywhere

15:54.074 --> 15:56.874
This is one of the great
traits of Maharashtra.

15:56.924 --> 16:00.074
We lost a kingdom because
of this brother bondage,

16:00.074 --> 16:02.874
because of this we should not
lose the kingdom of God anymore.

16:03.874 --> 16:07.124
people who are in the Lord's
work should be joined together.

16:07.521 --> 16:09.821
Should not deteriorate anyone.
Don't try to break anyone.

16:10.071 --> 16:12.471
This was not the abrogate
of Shivaji Maharaj.

16:13.583 --> 16:16.083
He felt the importance of
those who did some work.

16:17.083 --> 16:23.483
You know, when he got a Sinhgad, he said,
'The fort came but the lion went away.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.393
That's a very big deal.

16:25.643 --> 16:28.893
What if we got a fort,
but we lost a brave warrior!

16:29.143 --> 16:33.493
And from this behavior,
we all have to learn that

16:33.493 --> 16:37.943
Also In sahajyoga it is very important to
value another person thought with ease.

16:38.243 --> 16:39.753
Do not value yourself to much.

16:39.753 --> 16:43.293
I'm special, i'm particular, i'm
everything.don't do this.

16:43.293 --> 16:45.401
Many people think that they are educated.

16:45.401 --> 16:48.003
In sahajyoga many people are
comfortable and educated.

16:48.051 --> 16:51.118
So they don't mix with other
villagers. This is a wrong thing.

16:51.956 --> 16:53.801
Those people are
different, we are different,

16:53.834 --> 16:55.664
They lived differently,
we lived differently.

16:55.664 --> 16:58.997
If you feel that way, then
you will not get sahajyoga.

16:59.114 --> 17:02.914
yogis don't have cast,they don't
have High-low thoughts at all.

17:02.914 --> 17:07.314
Not only that, he is rich and he is
poor Thoughts.. Must not be in yogis.

17:07.314 --> 17:08.864
Only then you will become a yogi.

17:08.864 --> 17:12.764
So, the identity of the
yogis is that we are all one.

17:12.764 --> 17:17.124
We are all children of one mother.
There should be no difference between us.

17:17.124 --> 17:18.674
There should be equality.

17:20.123 --> 17:22.073
If we want to change our country,

17:22.097 --> 17:27.073
As we have seen an example of Shivaji

17:28.222 --> 17:31.972
There should be no flaws in yourself.

17:31.982 --> 17:35.388
If a person has his own flaws,
what will he be able to tell others?

17:35.388 --> 17:40.733
Secondly, those who followed
him had a great deal of faith in him.

17:40.783 --> 17:45.283
It is wrong just to blame
and arguing with leaders.

17:45.283 --> 17:48.343
If both should be reconciled,
then brothers is not a bond.

17:48.343 --> 17:52.076
If neither of these were reconciled,
then the brothers were in bondage.

17:52.993 --> 17:55.943
It is very wrong to Talk rash.

17:55.949 --> 18:01.049
But it is also wrong to not
respect our leader,to constantly

18:01.054 --> 18:05.387
humiliate him, to correct
him as such, to teach him.

18:06.804 --> 18:13.154
So if we handle these two things then
our brotherhood in our country will end.

18:13.664 --> 18:16.154
Must go.must
depart from the root.

18:16.154 --> 18:19.621
For this don't Look at the other's fault
first try to removed fault of yourself.

18:19.964 --> 18:26.114
I just want to say to satara
that,Swarajya is established in Satara

18:26.114 --> 18:30.814
And in satara swarjya Abolitionism began.

18:30.814 --> 18:33.515
So both things must be kept in mind.

18:33.564 --> 18:37.074
There should be no separation
between us. This is the act of love.

18:37.329 --> 18:39.062
Love should be added.

18:39.374 --> 18:43.525
Whatever other ideas and all the stuff
people do, some are intelligent people,

18:43.525 --> 18:46.024
Because of Intelligence
they get away from the other.

18:46.385 --> 18:48.824
You should stay on the brink of love.

18:49.035 --> 18:52.335
Love is the food of sahajyoga.

18:52.985 --> 18:54.985
How much do you love others?

18:54.985 --> 18:59.485
We need to look at how much we
give to others, rather than blame them.

19:00.885 --> 19:04.395
Thats why both things
should be used with care.

19:04.395 --> 19:08.509
I'm so happy! that this
work now, started in Satara.

19:08.945 --> 19:13.845
I felt very good yesterday. because Many
seekers were there. So many people passed.

19:13.845 --> 19:17.105
Sahajyoga going to make you big men,

19:17.105 --> 19:20.605
All those who are sitting in the
park. are the leaders of the future.

19:20.605 --> 19:22.805
I was very happy to see that.

19:22.805 --> 19:27.838
But we should remember that
what we had missed earlier in politics

19:28.955 --> 19:32.965
should not go missed in the kingdom of God.

19:32.965 --> 19:36.715
The laws of the Lord's Kingdom
are very strong and very strict.

19:36.715 --> 19:40.715
The person who goes against
that law is straight away defeated there.

19:40.715 --> 19:42.215
We should be careful.

19:42.215 --> 19:44.215
More careful.

19:44.465 --> 19:47.830
His blessings are also infinite.

19:48.230 --> 19:51.975
Forgiveness is also
infinite. But there are limits.

19:51.975 --> 19:54.725
After that, however, hi will become angry.

19:54.725 --> 19:56.975
There is nothing you can do.

19:56.975 --> 20:01.071
So remember, now we are
coming to the kingdom of the Lord,

20:01.725 --> 20:09.975
So it should be kept in mind that no dirty
politics of any kind is happening here.

20:10.085 --> 20:11.785
Don't bring this dirty thing over.

20:11.785 --> 20:15.685
In this love kingdom, We all are
tied to the Emecs by a cord.

20:15.685 --> 20:17.316
We are the children of a single mother.

20:17.935 --> 20:21.695
So the power that one has to gain
among others, now must gain on himself.

20:21.695 --> 20:24.495
This is not a place to rule on others.

20:24.495 --> 20:27.995
One must understand that this is
the place to take power over yourself.

20:27.995 --> 20:32.545
If you gain power over yourself, it
will first appear in your vibrations.

20:33.305 --> 20:37.055
Because of your vibrations, I can
understand what is going on with you

20:37.055 --> 20:39.855
How is going? How
much is the deterioration?

20:40.105 --> 20:46.255
So any brotherhood, Was
built,must be going to be demolished.

20:46.255 --> 20:49.765
Do not split in the groups,don't talk bad
behind someone's back as told by Mataji.

20:49.765 --> 20:51.315
Don't talk bad about anybody.

20:51.315 --> 20:53.815
Don't creates the groups.
Everyone should stay together.

20:55.065 --> 20:59.365
This thought came to me at
Satara, that Now the people here

20:59.365 --> 21:03.115
should be aware of it and
ask them to take a note of it.

21:03.115 --> 21:05.275
Because sahajyoga is Very easy to get.

21:06.525 --> 21:12.175
And the first thing that happened
to him, That is the power that a man has,

21:12.175 --> 21:14.108
he try to overpowers others.

21:14.375 --> 21:21.375
Or they say, 'Why does this man do that?

21:21.375 --> 21:22.875
That is a wrong.

21:22.875 --> 21:26.435
If a man is pressured,
people think, who is this?

21:26.435 --> 21:30.335
So in sahajyoga you should keep
in mind that Mataji has appointed

21:30.335 --> 21:33.385
one person everywhere.

21:33.409 --> 21:35.494
And she have relationships with everyone.

21:36.835 --> 21:40.395
Due to that one appointment,
he is relationship with mataji

21:40.895 --> 21:44.645
Just like we have a brain in our
head.That brain associated with our Body.

21:45.445 --> 21:47.945
We have to do same in sahajyoga.

21:47.945 --> 21:53.505
So if anything goes wrong with that guy,
I will notice right away, I can fix him.

21:53.505 --> 21:56.655
But if you try to remove his blame,
your going to make it all nasty.

21:57.905 --> 22:00.055
Yes or no. did you notice that.

22:00.305 --> 22:04.305
Accept one person who is your leader.

22:04.305 --> 22:09.215
I look at him. If he makes a
mistake, I understand everything.

22:11.015 --> 22:15.015
You don't know how well i
know this, because i don't tell you

22:15.015 --> 22:16.815
So that doesn't mean I don't know.

22:16.815 --> 22:17.965
I know everything.

22:17.965 --> 22:22.461
When we choose one man as
leader you have to agree on that.

22:22.461 --> 22:25.961
Trust your Mataji, she will do the right.

22:25.961 --> 22:29.621
You are more educated,
or you have more money,

22:29.621 --> 22:31.671
or whatever you have,
there is nothing to do.

22:32.071 --> 22:35.971
As long as I am okay with
man,accept him as your leader.

22:36.071 --> 22:40.071
Later on, if he do something
bad , let's remove him.

22:42.731 --> 22:45.131
you have to keep in mind
that I understand it myself.

22:45.131 --> 22:46.881
So that sahajyoga is going to increase

22:47.281 --> 22:53.432
Because though, sahajyoga
it has no organization,

22:53.432 --> 22:56.942
You don't have to pay
anything, there is no membership.

22:56.942 --> 22:58.349
Then how will we joint this?

22:59.842 --> 23:01.142
Will be connected with love.

23:01.142 --> 23:03.892
Everyone is connected in love.

23:03.892 --> 23:08.642
And second thing is that the power
of love comes from Mataji.

23:08.642 --> 23:12.892
So believe in the man they
called as leader, keep him.

23:12.892 --> 23:17.425
And if i see any evil thing in
his eyes, I will take him away.

23:17.852 --> 23:19.352
Will remove it exactly.

23:19.352 --> 23:23.112
So you  have to completely rely on me.

23:23.112 --> 23:25.162
How to make,

23:26.911 --> 23:28.161
our character?

23:28.911 --> 23:30.411
How should we act?

23:30.961 --> 23:34.211
to learn this,I'm right in front of you.

23:34.611 --> 23:38.361
If you think that we cannot be like
Mataji, then Look at Shivaji Maharaj.

23:38.871 --> 23:41.521
We have so many people.as example

23:41.521 --> 23:43.921
Nothing is too difficult for those who
have simply passed through sahjayoga.

23:43.921 --> 23:45.421
Life simply changes.

23:45.421 --> 23:47.321
Look at how much these
people have changed.

23:47.671 --> 23:50.371
they couldn't even sit on
the ground for five minutes.

23:50.621 --> 23:52.831
By hard work they
Learned to sit on the ground.

23:57.125 --> 23:58.875
So meditation should be done Neatly.

24:00.122 --> 24:02.513
Every evening,meditation
must performed for

24:02.538 --> 24:05.182
fifteen to twenty minutes
before falling asleep

24:05.182 --> 24:06.932
to achieving good things.

24:06.932 --> 24:12.842
Before going out in the morning
or after morning bath, five minutes

24:12.842 --> 24:14.897
worship the photo and it will do.

24:14.897 --> 24:17.892
But everyone should meet every week.

24:17.892 --> 24:20.392
If that is not the case,
sahajyoga simply doesn't work.

24:20.392 --> 24:25.642
Everyone should meet every week.
This is collective consciousness.

24:26.052 --> 24:29.602
'We kept a photo at home,We worship you
at home.But still we have this problem. '

24:29.602 --> 24:31.652
I don't give attention to them.

24:32.152 --> 24:38.652
I told you yesterday, that when you
rub the milk, the butter comes out,

24:38.652 --> 24:42.312
we take out the stick that is sticking
to it. and we Throw away the rest.

24:42.312 --> 24:47.612
We have the same people who clinging
to the pill.The rest is not in my focus.

24:48.112 --> 24:50.662
Then he must come to the
place where others men meet.

24:51.412 --> 24:54.662
Should speak,Should be
discussed ,But do not make a group.

24:54.662 --> 24:57.572
Speaking should be less, meditation
should be more, so it will be better.

24:57.662 --> 25:02.472
If there is grouping, I will heal you, I
will fix you,

25:02.472 --> 25:05.272
this kind of things will
started and it's not good.

25:05.634 --> 25:09.632
Everyone has to come there
and meditate, say Bhajan, do Aarti.

25:09.632 --> 25:12.132
If you have any questions, solved them

25:12.132 --> 25:17.932
But to sit there and argue
with each other , don't do that.

25:17.932 --> 25:25.382
On the contrary, what you
want to gain in sahajyoga'

25:25.382 --> 25:30.142
How about our growth? What has
been our growth? Where did we reched?

25:30.392 --> 25:37.442
I think, Maharashtra will Slowly get ,
sahjayoga.But sometimes i get worried,

25:37.442 --> 25:40.242
That my hard work should not be wasted.

25:43.352 --> 25:46.602
It is important to remember that you
have carry the burden of the whole world.

25:46.602 --> 25:50.152
The burden of the entire world
lies on these Maharashtrians people.

25:50.152 --> 25:51.852
It should be kept in mind.

25:51.852 --> 25:58.502
And if you decide it's possible for you.

25:58.752 --> 26:02.262
Whatever faults you have
must be removed by you.

26:03.012 --> 26:07.062
Sweetness should be brought into your
nature.you Must talk with love with others.

26:07.062 --> 26:10.762
Everyone should be treated equitably.

26:10.862 --> 26:14.112
If this is done in right way,it
will come inside naturally.

26:14.112 --> 26:16.612
Because,inside out You
become the same person.

26:16.672 --> 26:20.672
Whatever you put out, it will come
in. What you put in will come out.

26:20.722 --> 26:22.819
because inside out you are
same person, This does not

26:22.844 --> 26:25.096
happen.but now your in
relationship this thing happening.

26:26.322 --> 26:29.072
It is Deteriorated from the
outside, it does not sound

26:29.097 --> 26:31.596
and if Deteriorated from
inside it does not sound.

26:31.832 --> 26:33.332
Both things should be fine.

26:33.332 --> 26:36.782
Many people say that we meditate,
mataji, our vibrations come out fine.

26:36.782 --> 26:38.932
But the outside should be fine though.

26:38.932 --> 26:41.432
Otherwise, what is inside
will eventually disappear.

26:41.456 --> 26:46.542
Therefore, man must be
equal both inside and outside

26:46.542 --> 26:49.492
And it should look effulgent.

26:49.492 --> 26:55.242
There is no inflammation in personality.

26:55.242 --> 26:57.242
his personality should not be inflammatory.

26:57.242 --> 27:01.242
But it should be very mild
and beautiful, like the moon.

27:03.742 --> 27:06.992
Next time when i come here,
there will be more people.

27:06.992 --> 27:10.492
And we are going to
worship the god from here.

27:10.492 --> 27:12.992
But this time I will not come.

27:13.262 --> 27:14.742
But will Come next year.

27:14.912 --> 27:17.162
At that time I will probably
stay here for one night.

27:17.162 --> 27:19.562
So, let's see if anything happens.
