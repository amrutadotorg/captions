00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:11.529
Young Nirmala was also seized with the
Nationalistic zeal. She was always

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:18.275
extremely energetic and was a natural
leader among Her peers. In 1942 during the

00:00:18.275 --> 00:00:23.040
Quit India Movement She participated in
many daring episodes of picketing and was

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.405
also part of an underground group that
carried out many secret missions.

00:00:27.456 --> 00:00:36.006
Because we were all college students and
we all wanted to stop the colleges then,

00:00:36.006 --> 00:00:44.296
somehow or other we got into another kind
of mysterious acting. We used to distribute

00:00:44.296 --> 00:00:52.924
bulletins, used to call them, we used to
call them bullets and spread disorder

00:00:52.924 --> 00:01:01.038
among students. That time students were very
alert, that we should have our independence,

00:01:01.038 --> 00:01:07.631
we should be a free country and people
were not so dishonest that they are now.

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:18.739
After that I joined Science College because
I wanted to do Medicine but Science College

00:01:20.504 --> 00:01:28.574
we had a strike and I became the leader of
the students, so they asked Me to get out

00:01:28.574 --> 00:01:36.169
of the college, so I had to leave the
college. Then I went to Lucknow to study

00:01:36.475 --> 00:01:43.315
in Isabella Thoburn College - that's also
another missionary - but from there I did

00:01:43.315 --> 00:01:49.539
My Inter Science and then I did My
Medicine from Lahore.
