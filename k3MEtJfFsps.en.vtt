00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:12.428
Yesterday, you had asked me for the status
of a Guru.

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:20.272
It’s a state, it is not a status

00:00:20.473 --> 00:00:26.868
because status is external, can be bestowed
upon anyone,

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:33.991
and anybody can say that, “This is
your status.”

00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:41.035
For something external merit, or something,
you can give a status to a person.

00:00:41.236 --> 00:00:47.489
It is a state. ‘State’ means the innate
being,

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:58.060
evolved to that level that you become
the master.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.165
Of course,

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.023
you have to be your own master to begin
with. No doubt about it.

00:01:10.224 --> 00:01:13.725
If you are not even your own master,

00:01:13.926 --> 00:01:21.201
then how you can achieve that state?

00:01:22.345 --> 00:01:28.782
Now as I say it is innate; then one starts
thinking,

00:01:28.983 --> 00:01:35.181
“If it is innate, in a Sahaj way, how do
we achieve?”

00:01:43.497 --> 00:01:50.843
There are certain faculties which we have
to develop to begin with.

00:01:53.663 --> 00:02:03.236
The first faculty is if we can become
thoughtless.

00:02:04.972 --> 00:02:12.024
In meditation you can become thoughtless
for a short time.

00:02:12.634 --> 00:02:18.283
Gradually this short time should go on
increasing –

00:02:18.484 --> 00:02:21.848
that you are without any thought.

00:02:24.177 --> 00:02:28.501
This happens also as we can say is a state,

00:02:30.305 --> 00:02:34.088
but how do we achieve that, again?

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:39.439
Because human beings cannot understand
that anything can happen spontaneously,

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.004
it has to be done some - something has
to be done.

00:02:44.205 --> 00:02:52.825
For that, in Sahaj, we have something
very, very simple,

00:02:55.411 --> 00:03:01.807
that you have got a mantra as ‘nirvichar’.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:09.392
So now you watch anything saying
the mantra,

00:03:09.593 --> 00:03:13.143
“Twameva sakshat nirvichar,”

00:03:13.828 --> 00:03:22.971
then you’ll start seeing that, witnessing
that, without thinking.

00:03:25.235 --> 00:03:28.406
Just see, witness.

00:03:30.855 --> 00:03:37.236
Just seeing itself creates that state
within us, the first state,

00:03:37.437 --> 00:03:43.902
is very important, that you become
the witness, the sakshi.

00:03:48.673 --> 00:03:53.654
As soon as you become a sakshi,

00:03:56.199 --> 00:04:00.211
the whole thing whatever you are seeing

00:04:03.286 --> 00:04:12.037
gives you the complete idea, subtle
as well as gross, of that thing.

00:04:12.238 --> 00:04:17.187
You see it and you know it

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.507
and, as a Sahaja Yogi, it becomes
your knowledge.

00:04:23.708 --> 00:04:31.409
We can say, in the modern terminology,
that you see something,

00:04:31.721 --> 00:04:40.024
it gets recorded in your mind and it
manifests joy,

00:04:40.858 --> 00:04:49.985
it manifests knowledge, it manifests
compassion, whatever may [be] the situation.

00:04:50.946 --> 00:04:57.732
Because now you have many dimensions
which you have to develop,

00:04:57.933 --> 00:05:01.459
these dimensions are to be developed.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:08.036
Now supposing you go and meet someone
with whom you have to deal.

00:05:10.332 --> 00:05:16.610
He’s talking, talking, talking. Just become
thoughtless.

00:05:16.811 --> 00:05:20.602
So now, what is the thing that will happen
as soon as you become thoughtless?

00:05:20.803 --> 00:05:24.917
First his thoughts, his bombardment,
will not touch you

00:05:25.118 --> 00:05:28.397
because you are in a different realm
altogether.

00:05:28.598 --> 00:05:37.386
But in that realm your power will manifest:

00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:43.144
it may cool him down, it may shut him down

00:05:43.345 --> 00:05:50.127
or maybe he may just feel tremendous
love for you.

00:05:56.646 --> 00:06:01.448
So the word ‘guru’ means gravity:

00:06:02.764 --> 00:06:06.381
that the Mother Earth has gravity.

00:06:06.582 --> 00:06:13.388
In the same [way] a person who is a guru
has to have the gravity.

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:17.017
But how do you develop this gravity?

00:06:17.218 --> 00:06:22.763
Some people just artificially become
very grave

00:06:22.964 --> 00:06:29.075
and sometimes show that they are very
serious or something like that.

00:06:30.391 --> 00:06:33.930
Gravity is within yourself.

00:06:34.987 --> 00:06:43.827
In the second state, we should say, of guru
pada, is your gravity must manifest.

00:06:44.028 --> 00:06:50.079
As you become the witness your gravity
starts expressing itself.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:56.923
It will not show as temper or seriousness
or anything like that.

00:06:57.124 --> 00:07:02.445
But it will manifest in a way that

00:07:04.018 --> 00:07:09.557
the whole thing will become extremely
dignified and majestic.

00:07:09.758 --> 00:07:13.151
It will just manifest by itself.

00:07:13.352 --> 00:07:22.497
So the state in which you rise, now becomes
effective.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.079
Before this it was not.

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:34.509
You had to all the time manipulate,
say this, say that.

00:07:34.914 --> 00:07:42.478
But in your silence you can manifest
your gravity,

00:07:42.679 --> 00:07:50.663
and this gravity is extremely… it acts like
a magnet.

00:07:50.864 --> 00:07:54.179
As you know there’s a magnet in the Mother
Earth.

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:59.900
That we call as the gravity, by which
people are attracted.

00:08:00.101 --> 00:08:05.846
We are resting on this Mother Earth because
of her gravity.

00:08:06.099 --> 00:08:12.336
Everything is attracted to Mother Earth
because of her gravity.

00:08:13.026 --> 00:08:20.378
So you get a magnetic temperament,
magnetic character,

00:08:21.193 --> 00:08:23.994
magnetic personality.

00:08:24.195 --> 00:08:30.052
And this magnetic personality that you
develop,

00:08:30.253 --> 00:08:35.877
immediately shows that it is manifesting
its power.

00:08:36.078 --> 00:08:41.881
Just try to understand. Like the light now
is coming on me:

00:08:42.082 --> 00:08:47.778
it’s just giving light, but it is not
manifesting anything.

00:08:48.385 --> 00:08:52.048
We can see the sun’s rays, is the best
example.

00:08:52.249 --> 00:09:01.036
Sun’s rays when they fall onto the leaves,
the rays, which look simple,

00:09:01.237 --> 00:09:07.057
manifest their power of making it
into chlorophyll.

00:09:07.258 --> 00:09:15.486
In the same way, when you are at that
height or at that state,

00:09:15.687 --> 00:09:23.260
then without saying anything, without doing
anything, even a glance –

00:09:25.715 --> 00:09:32.136
you manifest. But not only that, but you
record everything.

00:09:34.127 --> 00:09:40.838
So many people must have noticed that
I seldom forget things.

00:09:41.047 --> 00:09:49.824
Like once I was travelling and I saw some
red stones near Sangamner.

00:09:50.025 --> 00:09:54.353
And when I said that “Why not we have some
red stones for Pratishthana”.

00:09:54.554 --> 00:09:57.328
They said, “But there are no red stones
in the whole of Maharashtra.”

00:09:57.529 --> 00:09:59.739
I said, “There are.” “Where?”

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:05.032
I said, “Go on the way of - you’ll find
them near Sangamner.” They said,

00:10:05.233 --> 00:10:07.874
“We have travelled so much that way,
we’ve never seen it.”

00:10:08.075 --> 00:10:10.915
I said, “I don’t know what you are seeing,
you know,

00:10:11.116 --> 00:10:13.849
what you are watching, I have definitely
seen.”

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:18.530
When they went there, they saw mountains
and mountains of these red stones,

00:10:18.731 --> 00:10:22.300
and they never noticed it even.

00:10:25.698 --> 00:10:33.560
So now, when you start witnessing something
without thought

00:10:33.761 --> 00:10:38.792
there’s no obstruction for absorbing
the knowledge about that thing,

00:10:38.993 --> 00:10:41.954
because there’s no thought.

00:10:42.509 --> 00:10:50.625
It’s complete absorption takes place.
And then it manifests.

00:10:53.167 --> 00:11:01.883
This is how the Divine Power works
within us.

00:11:07.695 --> 00:11:11.983
So with our gravity

00:11:12.753 --> 00:11:17.478
what we do is to touch that depth
within us,

00:11:17.679 --> 00:11:22.306
which can carry the Divine Power and
manifest it.

00:11:22.507 --> 00:11:26.121
Unless and until we touch that depth
within us,

00:11:26.322 --> 00:11:33.344
Sahaja Yoga is like ‘Hare Rama
Hare Krishna’.

00:11:35.852 --> 00:11:42.118
Nothing better than that. And that’s why
I find so many Sahaja Yogis, sometimes,

00:11:42.319 --> 00:11:48.072
really go off their rails suddenly.

00:11:48.273 --> 00:11:54.423
Because they have no gravity to go down
into their own being

00:11:54.624 --> 00:11:58.741
and to feel the beauty and the glory
of their own being

00:11:58.942 --> 00:12:07.194
and to use that gravity for manifesting
Divine Power.

00:12:10.671 --> 00:12:18.567
We could say that, supposing there is
a vehicle which is very weak,

00:12:19.633 --> 00:12:23.366
which is not yet properly fixed,

00:12:23.567 --> 00:12:30.087
cannot be used for something substantial.

00:12:30.896 --> 00:12:36.853
And the most substantial thing in your
lives is this Divine Power;

00:12:37.054 --> 00:12:45.381
which looks very light. You never feel
the weight of this Divine Power.

00:12:45.582 --> 00:12:50.212
You’ll never feel the pressure of this
Divine Power.

00:12:52.398 --> 00:12:59.593
But if you are not clean, if your channel
is not clean,

00:12:59.794 --> 00:13:05.776
then this Divine Power cannot flow
properly, it cannot manifest.

00:13:05.977 --> 00:13:10.402
So when we say that we are the instrument
of God Almighty,

00:13:10.603 --> 00:13:14.675
then like this instrument we are; now we
are connected to the mains.

00:13:14.884 --> 00:13:17.984
If this instrument is not all right

00:13:18.185 --> 00:13:24.294
then it cannot manifest whatever it is
supposed to do.

00:13:24.495 --> 00:13:31.313
But we are much above all these ordinary
instruments,

00:13:31.514 --> 00:13:40.214
even the most complicated, even the most
advanced and developed by science.

00:13:40.415 --> 00:13:47.543
Because we reach a state where we ourselves
become the science.

00:13:47.744 --> 00:13:52.620
Science of Truth, an Absolute Truth.

00:13:52.821 --> 00:14:00.564
So what is needed for a Guru is
self-esteem.

00:14:00.765 --> 00:14:06.956
This is a very important point [which]
people don’t realise: the self-esteem.

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:13.135
To achieve the self-esteem we have
to introspect

00:14:13.336 --> 00:14:19.916
and know that, “Today I am not what
I was before.

00:14:20.117 --> 00:14:26.895
I’m a realised soul. I have got powers.
Of course I have powers.

00:14:27.096 --> 00:14:34.412
Powers of love, powers of compassion,
powers of grasping things,

00:14:36.056 --> 00:14:45.885
powers of creativity, powers of giving
realisations to others.”

00:14:46.086 --> 00:14:49.049
Nobody had these powers!

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:53.757
But somehow or other in Sahaja Yog we are
not self-conscious.

00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:58.031
And we should not be self-conscious because
that can give you ego,

00:14:58.232 --> 00:15:02.202
but we should have self-esteem.

00:15:02.403 --> 00:15:09.789
“I’m a Guru. I’m a Guru. I’m not
an ordinary person.

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:15.270
I’m not on the street. I’m something
special.

00:15:15.471 --> 00:15:20.127
I’m on the shores of Truth.

00:15:20.328 --> 00:15:29.634
I have to salvage the people who are blind,
who are mad,” all kinds of things.

00:15:29.835 --> 00:15:34.934
In a most chaotic conditions this world
is today.

00:15:35.135 --> 00:15:43.881
So at that time a kind of a silence will
come within you.

00:15:44.082 --> 00:15:49.444
When there will be any such crisis,
immediately you’ll become extremely silent.

00:15:49.645 --> 00:15:53.040
But this is again a state I’m telling you.

00:15:53.241 --> 00:16:04.404
So now if there is something that makes
you upset or makes you unhappy,

00:16:05.218 --> 00:16:12.595
try to reach that point, that axis,
which is just silence.

00:16:13.739 --> 00:16:17.236
And this silence will make you really
powerful

00:16:17.437 --> 00:16:21.871
because this silence is not only yours.

00:16:22.072 --> 00:16:27.814
When you are in that silence you are
in the silence of the cosmos,

00:16:28.022 --> 00:16:38.325
silence of the cosmos. And the silence
of the cosmos works for you.

00:16:38.526 --> 00:16:41.473
You are in connection

00:16:44.921 --> 00:16:48.062
with that Cosmic Power we can call it,

00:16:48.263 --> 00:16:52.137
but it’s more than that, is Divine Power
I should say -

00:16:52.338 --> 00:16:56.791
Divine power which is working
all the cosmos also.

00:16:59.663 --> 00:17:09.526
So, if you just become silent within
yourself,

00:17:09.727 --> 00:17:14.847
know that you are sitting in the Kingdom
of God.

00:17:18.603 --> 00:17:24.281
It’s like this: when, say,

00:17:24.482 --> 00:17:36.236
you get the great honour of becoming
a king,

00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:43.593
then you walk up to your throne and you
sit down

00:17:43.802 --> 00:17:51.344
and look around and you feel the silence

00:17:52.402 --> 00:17:59.006
of this state that, now, you are the king.

00:18:00.279 --> 00:18:07.639
This silence is the sign that you are
definitely, definitely,

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:17.313
you are now in contact with the Divine.

00:18:17.514 --> 00:18:22.802
You are silent because the Divine is going
to look after everything.

00:18:24.679 --> 00:18:28.685
You don’t have to do anything: just
keep silent.

00:18:28.886 --> 00:18:33.289
But not forcibly. It’s, again, a state.

00:18:34.064 --> 00:18:38.455
You see, if any turmoil takes place,
any problem takes place,

00:18:38.656 --> 00:18:43.840
suddenly your attention will jump onto
that silence,

00:18:44.584 --> 00:18:48.243
and once you jump onto that silence

00:18:48.444 --> 00:18:52.632
you [are] being in contact with this
whole All-pervading Power.

00:18:52.833 --> 00:18:59.004
And when I talk about All-pervading Power
we still don’t understand what it is,

00:18:59.205 --> 00:19:02.629
what it means, this All-pervading Power
of love.

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:06.628
Is it some sort of an energy floating
around?

00:19:06.829 --> 00:19:17.565
Or is it some sort of a river? Or some sort
of a ether?

00:19:21.339 --> 00:19:32.198
It is the complete, the totality
of Reality.

00:19:33.251 --> 00:19:40.847
Complete totality of Reality, is this
All-pervading Power.

00:19:41.048 --> 00:19:44.832
Other things are unreal.

00:19:47.625 --> 00:19:52.533
And the Reality is so efficient…

00:20:03.069 --> 00:20:08.823
It is so efficient, It never fails,
like this mic.

00:20:15.645 --> 00:20:25.868
It’s such a tremendous, we can call –
the intertwined process;

00:20:26.325 --> 00:20:35.599
which we cannot even imagine with this
human understanding,

00:20:37.393 --> 00:20:41.313
how It controls, how It works.

00:20:43.224 --> 00:20:48.818
I mean, for example [if] you see the trees.

00:20:49.019 --> 00:20:54.952
The rose bush will give roses only,
it won’t give apples.

00:20:55.153 --> 00:21:01.620
It will grow up to a certain height,
it won’t grow like a coconut tree.

00:21:02.048 --> 00:21:13.975
All the characters of this nature is
maintained, nourished, looked after,

00:21:14.176 --> 00:21:22.895
controlled absolutely, at the right time,
at the right seasons -

00:21:23.096 --> 00:21:27.000
that’s why in Sanskrit this is called
as ‘Rutambhara Pragya’.

00:21:27.201 --> 00:21:34.160
‘Rutu’ means seasons, and the One which
looks after the seasons,

00:21:34.361 --> 00:21:40.872
that knowledge which is enlightened:
simple definition.

00:21:41.073 --> 00:21:45.421
But still it doesn’t explain,

00:21:45.622 --> 00:21:53.584
because it is so complicated for a human
brain

00:21:53.785 --> 00:21:57.925
that they cannot understand how it works.

00:21:58.126 --> 00:22:01.926
Now all the miracles you have described
I’ve seen.

00:22:02.127 --> 00:22:06.624
I mean, there are so many still to be
recorded.

00:22:08.181 --> 00:22:12.446
Is just a play of this Power

00:22:12.647 --> 00:22:20.838
which thinks, understands, co-operates,
co-ordinates and loves

00:22:22.901 --> 00:22:31.023
and looks after you. [It] is at your
disposal, at your disposal.

00:22:31.224 --> 00:22:35.686
Wherever you go the connection is
maintained.

00:22:35.887 --> 00:22:40.656
It’s like a governor travelling, you see,
the security travels with him.

00:22:40.857 --> 00:22:44.085
So they are all around.

00:22:44.426 --> 00:22:50.395
Not only with Me but with you also.

00:22:51.562 --> 00:22:56.949
You are already booked there.

00:22:57.261 --> 00:23:01.188
And They know you are the one they have
to look after,

00:23:01.389 --> 00:23:04.486
They won’t look after anybody else,

00:23:04.687 --> 00:23:08.227
They won’t do anything for anybody else
but for you people.

00:23:08.428 --> 00:23:11.002
Now try to understand the self-esteem part.

00:23:11.203 --> 00:23:15.033
You are Sahaja Yogis, means you are
such special people

00:23:15.234 --> 00:23:21.719
that this Divine Power, wherever you may be,
whether you are sleeping, you are walking

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:28.436
or you are sitting under the tree or
in your house, wherever you are,

00:23:28.637 --> 00:23:35.105
that connection is maintained. Like a
talkie-walkie you can call it, at the most.

00:23:35.306 --> 00:23:38.396
But you don’t have to talk, you don’t have
to say anything,

00:23:38.597 --> 00:23:42.972
you don’t have to command, you don’t have
to request,

00:23:43.173 --> 00:23:47.956
nothing - it is at your disposal.

00:23:50.157 --> 00:23:56.089
Because already you are one
of the governors in the Realm of God.

00:23:56.290 --> 00:24:01.673
So all the protocol, that is yours. Anybody
who tries to insult you or trouble you

00:24:01.874 --> 00:24:08.062
has to pay for that kind of an action.
So you should never worry.

00:24:08.263 --> 00:24:12.955
You should never think of those things
on the mundane level.

00:24:13.156 --> 00:24:15.720
On the contrary I would say, better
forgive,

00:24:15.921 --> 00:24:20.686
because God knows what will happen to that
person who misbehaves.

00:24:20.887 --> 00:24:28.434
It is not only compassion, also It is
wrathful,

00:24:29.379 --> 00:24:31.835
It is wrathful.

00:24:32.793 --> 00:24:41.264
You are special people; only thing [is]
you have to have your self-esteem

00:24:41.465 --> 00:24:50.615
and you must try to maintain your balance.

00:24:51.915 --> 00:24:58.079
Once you come in balance, the job of
a Guru is to give balance to others.

00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:02.197
It balances everything. It will balance
the nature,

00:25:02.398 --> 00:25:06.978
climate, atmosphere, society, human beings.

00:25:07.179 --> 00:25:10.611
It is there to balance you.

00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:20.008
And that balance comes from the Guru
Principle which balances you.

00:25:20.209 --> 00:25:26.510
If you have Guru Principle in you, you get
into balance – automatically!

00:25:28.079 --> 00:25:31.268
Automatically you become a balanced
personality.

00:25:31.469 --> 00:25:36.368
Nobody has to tell you, “Now you balance,”
you are balanced.

00:25:37.473 --> 00:25:41.645
So now, how do we develop that balance?

00:25:46.343 --> 00:25:52.808
Of course in the ancient times they had
very severe methods –

00:25:53.025 --> 00:25:57.946
is not to eat much, to starve yourself

00:25:58.147 --> 00:26:02.647
and go to Himalayas, stand on your heads
and do all kinds of things.

00:26:02.848 --> 00:26:07.805
This will bring great imbalance.

00:26:08.006 --> 00:26:14.501
If you become an austere personality
it will make you such a dry person

00:26:14.702 --> 00:26:20.896
that nobody would like to stand near you;
I mean, you’ll be burning, absolutely.

00:26:21.097 --> 00:26:26.665
So the ascetic ideas, I don’t know from
where it has come, whatever it has come.

00:26:26.866 --> 00:26:33.812
Maybe because they wanted people to pay
more attention to their Spirit.

00:26:34.749 --> 00:26:41.507
But a Guru is not ascetic by nature.

00:26:42.717 --> 00:26:46.471
But he is so detached that he is ascetic.

00:26:46.672 --> 00:26:51.255
He may be the king or he may be a beggar

00:26:51.456 --> 00:26:55.386
or he may be a big personality somewhere

00:26:55.587 --> 00:26:59.367
or he may be just an ordinary person.

00:26:59.568 --> 00:27:10.251
If he is a Guru then in every state he is
in complete balance.

00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:14.449
Nothing can disturb him.

00:27:14.650 --> 00:27:22.311
Supposing you put a crown on his head –
so what?

00:27:22.512 --> 00:27:31.402
Whether it is a cardboard crown, silver
or gold or diamonds or anything,

00:27:31.603 --> 00:27:39.981
it can never impress him and he can never
go into imbalances.

00:27:49.138 --> 00:27:55.751
Food for example; food is one of the weak
points, I think.

00:27:56.871 --> 00:28:05.031
A Guru who might eat quite a lot, he may
not eat at all;

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:13.619
may like something to eat, something not
to eat, whatever it is.

00:28:14.559 --> 00:28:21.183
But nothing can dominate this Guru.

00:28:21.798 --> 00:28:28.795
So the symptom is that you are in balance

00:28:28.996 --> 00:28:34.799
and you cannot be dominated by food
or by power

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:41.515
or by wealth or money or anything – nothing
can dominate you.

00:28:43.534 --> 00:28:46.759
You are above all these things.

00:28:47.924 --> 00:28:53.592
And once you know that you are above
these things,

00:28:55.440 --> 00:29:00.318
then you are not afraid. No more you
are afraid.

00:29:00.519 --> 00:29:07.097
Fearlessness comes into you, you become
absolutely fearless.

00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:15.983
Nothing can, nothing can put you
into imbalance;

00:29:16.184 --> 00:29:22.859
nothing can dominate you; nothing can
weaken you;

00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:31.551
nothing can make you an addict; nothing
is tempting.

00:29:34.292 --> 00:29:39.321
There’s nothing like temptation left
anymore.

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:46.345
When you reach that state, beyond
temptation,

00:29:47.114 --> 00:29:51.746
beyond any greed, beyond any lust,

00:29:53.635 --> 00:30:04.386
then there is no problem;

00:30:04.587 --> 00:30:10.353
nothing, nothing can really bring you down.

00:30:13.326 --> 00:30:22.550
You may wear an ordinary tulsi [Indian
basil] garland, or you may wear

00:30:25.973 --> 00:30:29.803
pearls, or diamonds, or anything.

00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:38.610
That doesn’t touch you. But you don’t run
away from anything.

00:30:38.811 --> 00:30:43.118
Because when you run away from something
you become an ascetic artificially.

00:30:43.319 --> 00:30:47.957
Asceticism is within yourself – innate.

00:30:49.362 --> 00:30:54.671
So nothing can hamper you, nothing can
matter.

00:30:58.987 --> 00:31:05.749
That state we have to see. But mostly what
happens with people [is]

00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:09.652
they’ll say, “Mother, I don’t think I’m
a Guru.” I said, “Why?”

00:31:09.853 --> 00:31:13.571
“Because what symptom you told me,
all they are there.

00:31:13.772 --> 00:31:17.822
I still want to eat this food, I still -
this thing.”

00:31:18.023 --> 00:31:21.446
You are going the other way round.

00:31:23.155 --> 00:31:26.896
You shouldn’t try to weigh upon what
I’m telling you

00:31:27.097 --> 00:31:32.345
or try to judge yourself. Don’t judge.

00:31:32.679 --> 00:31:37.739
You just gradually rise - appreciate
yourself.

00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:48.345
And gradually you rise and settle down
on the position that you have achieved.

00:31:48.546 --> 00:31:57.605
Instead of that you’ll feel very diffident
and you’ll feel very much depressed

00:31:57.806 --> 00:32:01.815
if you start judging, “Oh, Mother has said
that we must have this,

00:32:02.016 --> 00:32:05.310
Mother has said we must have this.”

00:32:07.591 --> 00:32:15.078
If you all the time start judging yourself,
this will not help you.

00:32:15.279 --> 00:32:22.534
You are self-assured! You are sure about
yourself.

00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:29.246
There’s nothing to judge yourself
or to tally.

00:32:29.447 --> 00:32:35.182
Sometimes I see some people go on saying,
“Mother said so.”

00:32:36.277 --> 00:32:39.031
I might have said, might not have said,
out of reference,

00:32:39.232 --> 00:32:46.438
whatever it is. What is it? Now, I have
said so. What are you saying?

00:32:49.913 --> 00:32:52.559
Because this is a very good way
of troubling others:

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:56.521
“Mother said so.” “What did she say?”

00:32:56.722 --> 00:33:03.992
“That you should not take your food
every day.” I never said it.

00:33:04.285 --> 00:33:08.346
But somebody can start something like
that, stupid.

00:33:09.062 --> 00:33:13.395
Supposing even if I’ve said it – doesn’t
matter – what do you have to say?

00:33:13.596 --> 00:33:22.931
So you even out-grow, into your own
experience, what is good.

00:33:23.132 --> 00:33:28.189
You wouldn’t believe that I, as a human
being I’m useless.

00:33:28.390 --> 00:33:30.782
Really, it was very difficult.

00:33:30.983 --> 00:33:33.809
Actually my Father used to tell me so many
things about human beings.

00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:38.272
What sort of a things they are and how
I should appear.

00:33:38.473 --> 00:33:42.952
And it’s very difficult to be a human
being, very, very difficult.

00:33:43.675 --> 00:33:46.242
First I didn’t know why the reactions are
like this,

00:33:46.443 --> 00:33:51.238
why people behave like this and what to do
with them, how to manage them.

00:33:51.439 --> 00:33:58.922
It’s quite difficult. You can say even
William Blake had the same problem.

00:33:59.466 --> 00:34:03.887
But when you reach that state,

00:34:06.539 --> 00:34:12.564
then you’re just enjoying yourself.

00:34:14.111 --> 00:34:19.340
For you, you have a greater enjoyment
than mine.

00:34:20.987 --> 00:34:29.801
Because you are already human beings,
so you know about human beings.

00:34:30.583 --> 00:34:40.124
And then you see your ascent and it’s much
easier for you to appreciate [that].

00:34:40.712 --> 00:34:45.681
For me it is… I don’t know, because I’ve
never known temptations,

00:34:45.882 --> 00:34:49.217
I’ve never known all these qualities
that you had,

00:34:49.418 --> 00:34:57.055
so I don’t know how to judge what is coming
out of it, you see.

00:34:58.327 --> 00:35:02.855
If you don’t have any problems,

00:35:03.056 --> 00:35:10.091
if you never had any, say, temptations.

00:35:12.051 --> 00:35:15.739
As you were you are – what is so great?

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:23.162
But from something human you have come
to a higher level,

00:35:23.446 --> 00:35:29.842
is very creditable. And you can enjoy
much more than I could enjoy

00:35:30.043 --> 00:35:36.286
or Christ could enjoy or Shri Krishna
could enjoy.

00:35:41.256 --> 00:35:48.741
Because the one who has risen, has grown,

00:35:48.942 --> 00:35:55.521
now feels the fragrance of his virtues
and qualities and greatness;

00:35:55.722 --> 00:35:58.732
then he enjoys himself.

00:35:59.732 --> 00:36:07.546
“So what? I’m sitting here,” he’ll say,
“all right, I’m sitting here,

00:36:07.747 --> 00:36:12.388
why are you bothered? I’m all right!”

00:36:16.386 --> 00:36:30.583
To him a proper understanding of this
change comes.

00:36:31.749 --> 00:36:36.357
And he understands other human beings
much better

00:36:36.558 --> 00:36:44.402
who don’t have your capacity, your
knowledge, your depth, your gravity.

00:36:44.603 --> 00:36:49.177
Because you have been a human being.
Now you are Divine.

00:36:49.378 --> 00:36:57.960
Because you have been a human being,
you understand other people.

00:36:58.415 --> 00:37:06.247
So a Guru like me, I don’t know,

00:37:10.154 --> 00:37:15.273
it’s a very different situation here
because I’m a Mother

00:37:16.175 --> 00:37:23.780
and I have seen these Gurus, the real Gurus;
they are very harsh people, I must say.

00:37:23.981 --> 00:37:28.355
I couldn’t understand how they beat people,
how they thrash them,

00:37:28.556 --> 00:37:31.858
they hang them on the well, do all kinds
of things;

00:37:32.059 --> 00:37:36.182
I couldn’t understand why do they do it.

00:37:36.512 --> 00:37:42.306
But they have come out from the human
level, with struggles and fights,

00:37:42.539 --> 00:37:46.050
so they think that, “Why should others
get it so easily?

00:37:46.251 --> 00:37:48.831
Why not they also have the problem?”

00:37:49.032 --> 00:37:52.078
But you didn’t get it on to all these
problems.

00:37:52.279 --> 00:37:55.325
You are different from those gurus.

00:37:55.526 --> 00:38:01.693
You got it sahaj. In a very simple manner,
you didn’t do anything.

00:38:01.894 --> 00:38:08.526
Sahaj you got it, absolutely sahaj. You
didn’t do anything about it.

00:38:09.799 --> 00:38:15.502
So your role as a guru is different from
those gurus

00:38:15.703 --> 00:38:20.754
who struggled so much to become a evolved
soul.

00:38:21.579 --> 00:38:25.552
So your attitude towards things

00:38:25.753 --> 00:38:32.960
has to be more compassionate, more
understanding,

00:38:33.161 --> 00:38:38.899
more loving. As you got it sahaj,
others can also get it from you.

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:44.275
You don’t have to do something horrible,
you don’t have to shout at them.

00:38:44.476 --> 00:38:48.338
Some people who met me told me,
and which is very sad,

00:38:48.539 --> 00:38:51.348
that some sahaja yogis said something
harsh to them

00:38:51.549 --> 00:38:54.351
so they had to leave Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:54.552 --> 00:39:00.884
A sahaja yogi should never say anything
harsh to anyone; he has no right to say.

00:39:02.206 --> 00:39:05.517
Because without saying anything to you,
you got your realisation,

00:39:05.727 --> 00:39:11.089
absolutely free. Without doing anything
you have got your realisation

00:39:11.290 --> 00:39:14.209
and if somebody is coming to you
for realisation

00:39:14.410 --> 00:39:18.035
you must do in the same manner.

00:39:18.236 --> 00:39:29.780
You didn’t get it through some sort of
a austere, austere - we can say - training.

00:39:30.153 --> 00:39:32.986
So this attitude must be changed.

00:39:33.187 --> 00:39:36.919
And I’ve seen that if you have this
attitude

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:41.006
then you could be a guru, but not sahaj.

00:39:42.724 --> 00:39:48.656
So now try to understand that there is
a difference between a sahaja guru

00:39:48.857 --> 00:39:56.785
and a non-sahaj guru. They are very
hot-tempered, very.

00:39:57.213 --> 00:40:03.045
And a sahaj guru has no business to be
hot-tempered.

00:40:08.339 --> 00:40:12.664
Everything so nice, so beautiful we have,

00:40:12.865 --> 00:40:19.544
all enjoying this beautiful atmosphere.

00:40:19.745 --> 00:40:24.820
Such love, such compassion, such respect
for each other.

00:40:25.021 --> 00:40:29.033
No competition, no politics.

00:40:32.133 --> 00:40:37.191
Just if you understand one thing that you
have got everything in sahaj manner,

00:40:37.392 --> 00:40:41.321
and in the same sahaj manner you can
give it to others

00:40:41.522 --> 00:40:48.575
and you’ll respect others [in] the same
manner, I think you’ll be able to…

00:40:48.776 --> 00:40:51.268
[There’s a gentleman who’s taking
photographs, see who he is,

00:40:51.469 --> 00:40:54.948
he is not supposed to take photographs
of all these things.

00:41:01.359 --> 00:41:04.626
Without permission he should not take.

00:41:12.169 --> 00:41:15.574
(Marathi: get the film reel from them).

00:41:20.726 --> 00:41:23.765
(Marathi: get the film reel from them).

00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:28.962
These are mischievous people, you know].

00:41:41.787 --> 00:41:45.826
So now we are in a sahaj style.

00:41:46.027 --> 00:41:52.152
You all know that you’ve got all
the powers, that you are all gurus,

00:41:52.353 --> 00:41:57.467
that you have achieved so much, you can
do so much.

00:41:58.117 --> 00:42:01.890
Then you have to be sahaj.
You got it sahaj,

00:42:02.091 --> 00:42:09.722
so you have no business to be harsh,
horrible, hot-tempered or strict gurus.

00:42:09.923 --> 00:42:12.797
But it crawls up. I’ve seen sometimes

00:42:12.998 --> 00:42:16.808
quite a lot of military business starts
in Sahaja Yoga also:

00:42:17.009 --> 00:42:22.643
military sort of treatment. That cannot be.

00:42:23.098 --> 00:42:28.935
No disciplining is needed. They’ll be
disciplined by themselves.

00:42:29.136 --> 00:42:32.790
They are gurus, who can discipline a guru?

00:42:32.991 --> 00:42:40.464
And then they are sahaj. So your style
is very different.

00:42:42.571 --> 00:42:46.262
None of these gurus knew how to even
give realisation.

00:42:46.463 --> 00:42:49.467
I’m telling you frankly.

00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:55.110
They never knew that Kundalini can rise
with their hands.

00:42:55.311 --> 00:43:02.390
Very few people historically have given
realisation – so far.

00:43:02.591 --> 00:43:06.656
But you people are giving left and right
to anybody who comes, sit down.

00:43:06.857 --> 00:43:09.669
Just now I said, “All right, come along,
look at this person”.

00:43:09.870 --> 00:43:12.710
So all of you sit down, “Now, this is it,
this is it.”

00:43:12.911 --> 00:43:18.516
You have crossed the limits of science now.
You have become science yourself

00:43:18.717 --> 00:43:21.311
of the Divine and you know each and
everything about it,

00:43:21.512 --> 00:43:25.987
“This chakra is catching, that is catching,
I’m catching, you are catching.”

00:43:26.188 --> 00:43:30.922
But the way we deal with others is
the guru pada:

00:43:32.397 --> 00:43:36.637
kindness, sweetness, concern.

00:43:36.838 --> 00:43:43.640
That’s what your Mother has given you -
concern.

00:43:49.483 --> 00:43:57.355
The concern that flows; about each
and every person.

00:43:57.829 --> 00:44:01.237
You have to have concern.

00:44:01.438 --> 00:44:10.027
But these gurus: “Now you go!” They’ll
[say]: “Die, kill yourself! Eat grass.”

00:44:12.693 --> 00:44:15.287
No, not that way.

00:44:17.272 --> 00:44:22.795
So you also have to be a motherly guru,

00:44:25.108 --> 00:44:32.345
a sweet guru, extremely sweet, kindly

00:44:35.402 --> 00:44:40.242
and understanding, forgiving.

00:44:41.904 --> 00:44:49.475
Because what is the purpose? What is
the purpose?

00:44:49.676 --> 00:44:52.888
The purpose is to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:44:53.089 --> 00:44:56.329
That’s the main thing we miss out:
that the purpose

00:44:56.530 --> 00:44:59.034
of our realisation or of our birth

00:44:59.235 --> 00:45:03.534
is to give realisations to others,
to spread Sahaja Yoga,

00:45:03.735 --> 00:45:07.503
to emancipate others, by that to emancipate
the whole world.

00:45:07.672 --> 00:45:14.721
It’s our responsibility. If you are
responsible then how do you behave?

00:45:17.795 --> 00:45:22.113
So no more we have priesthood, no more.

00:45:22.314 --> 00:45:24.804
Nor that one person says so,

00:45:25.005 --> 00:45:28.891
that person says so, this has happened -
nothing of the kind.

00:45:29.092 --> 00:45:33.704
What you have to say, you say it
to that person.

00:45:33.905 --> 00:45:37.968
And you yourself will see how you are
reflecting

00:45:38.169 --> 00:45:41.828
your personality on another person,

00:45:42.376 --> 00:45:48.513
how he reacts and he, how he behaves.

00:45:48.714 --> 00:45:53.805
Gradually I’ve seen our collectivity
is learning all this.

00:45:54.006 --> 00:45:57.989
Gradually I find all those horrible
dominating people

00:45:58.190 --> 00:46:00.789
have run away from Sahaja Yoga.

00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:08.037
Also I find that people are extremely
loving

00:46:08.364 --> 00:46:14.282
and kindly to each other and also
to others.

00:46:15.369 --> 00:46:21.042
Because you are embodiment of goodness,
embodiment of righteousness,

00:46:21.243 --> 00:46:27.932
you are embodiment of patience,
compassion, love and concern.

00:46:31.649 --> 00:46:38.720
So it is not how you can do it, you are
already.

00:46:39.554 --> 00:46:46.742
But you shouldn’t just give up. I said,
“Just look at something and watch.”

00:46:46.943 --> 00:46:50.717
Nobody can do that, but you all can do it.

00:46:51.844 --> 00:46:59.256
So the self-esteem, and then assumption.
Assume your powers.

00:47:01.333 --> 00:47:06.384
If you are a guru, then assume your power.

00:47:06.774 --> 00:47:13.273
You do not assume your power.
You still think,

00:47:13.979 --> 00:47:18.391
“God knows if I have the powers or not”,
this, that.

00:47:18.592 --> 00:47:25.617
That means you are just a beginner still.
“No, I’m the guru, all right.”

00:47:28.284 --> 00:47:32.093
We do say, “Mother, I’m my own guru,”
that’s all.

00:47:32.294 --> 00:47:34.841
But is just saying from the lips.

00:47:35.042 --> 00:47:40.140
Not only that you are your own guru
but of the whole world.

00:47:41.952 --> 00:47:48.610
It’s a collective ‘gurudom’ we have,
I should say collective.

00:47:48.811 --> 00:47:55.146
And nothing can escape us now, we are
formidable, absolutely formidable.

00:47:55.347 --> 00:47:58.351
Nothing can escape us.

00:48:00.206 --> 00:48:10.953
If this is understood that we have
to assume.

00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:16.298
Here now, they elect somebody who is
a very cruel man,

00:48:16.499 --> 00:48:23.330
put some clothes on him and say he is
the pope. All right, he’s the pope.

00:48:23.531 --> 00:48:26.256
But he is not!

00:48:27.129 --> 00:48:31.726
He is just acting, but inside he is not.

00:48:31.927 --> 00:48:37.726
That he is infallible - he is fallible!
100 times.

00:48:39.842 --> 00:48:45.478
That is not with us. We have all these
things within ourselves.

00:48:45.695 --> 00:48:52.621
We’ve got them, they are there, we are the
possessors of that, only thing you assume.

00:48:52.822 --> 00:48:56.388
Once you start assuming, all badhas will
run away, everything will run away

00:48:56.589 --> 00:49:01.210
and you’ll be surprised. Who can stand
a person

00:49:01.411 --> 00:49:04.592
who is a saint, who is a guru and who
knows he is a guru?

00:49:04.793 --> 00:49:08.570
Nobody can stand. They’ll run away.

00:49:11.368 --> 00:49:16.905
But you have to have introspection

00:49:17.106 --> 00:49:25.053
to see that your self-esteem is completely
correct.

00:49:25.254 --> 00:49:28.910
It’s not just [that] you are thinking
you are a guru.

00:49:30.290 --> 00:49:36.453
I have known some real gurus and I would
never allow you to go to them

00:49:36.654 --> 00:49:42.367
because God knows if you can come back
in one piece or not.

00:49:43.676 --> 00:49:49.443
And I’ve told them, that they are real
gurus, I know, but don’t go near them.

00:49:51.025 --> 00:49:56.316
Because what they lack is this compassion,
this sahaj style.

00:49:56.517 --> 00:49:58.744
Because they think they have worked
very hard,

00:49:58.945 --> 00:50:02.959
so why should these people not work
very hard.

00:50:05.757 --> 00:50:12.405
You may be anything. You can be doing
this work, that work.

00:50:12.606 --> 00:50:16.742
You may be educated, not educated,
makes no difference.

00:50:16.943 --> 00:50:21.885
Whether you are rich, poor, makes
no difference at all,

00:50:24.565 --> 00:50:31.029
as long as you know that you are the guru
and you assume your power.

00:50:31.230 --> 00:50:39.031
In that assumption as if any talent, if you
know music, you know you know music.

00:50:39.672 --> 00:50:43.257
If you know how to cook, you know
how to cook.

00:50:44.066 --> 00:50:46.356
If you are an administrator and if you know
administration,

00:50:46.557 --> 00:50:53.250
you know administration. But that could be
also not totally absolute.

00:50:53.451 --> 00:51:00.144
But you are already Absolute Totality
of Reality.

00:51:00.345 --> 00:51:05.673
The Reality is at your disposal. But you
assume it!

00:51:05.874 --> 00:51:09.213
You are not ordinary at all.

00:51:09.414 --> 00:51:13.882
We can say you are extraordinary
in ordinary.

00:51:17.416 --> 00:51:25.501
In that you will just drop out all that
is nonsensical, you’ll just drop out.

00:51:27.356 --> 00:51:34.721
Others will see you and will be surprised:
what sort of people these are.

00:51:35.313 --> 00:51:42.342
What sort of a life they lead, how nice
they are, how kind they are.

00:51:42.543 --> 00:51:45.609
And the knowledge is so subtle and so
great

00:51:45.810 --> 00:51:53.774
and of such a highest degree. But you never
feel bloated up with ego.

00:51:53.975 --> 00:51:57.450
I have not seen any sahaja yogi who says,
“Oh, I know all about chakras,

00:51:57.651 --> 00:52:03.840
this and that. How dare you say like that!”
With the moustaches upward.

00:52:06.569 --> 00:52:11.245
No! With all this knowledge you bend down

00:52:11.446 --> 00:52:16.022
like the tree which is laden with fruits
bends down.

00:52:16.514 --> 00:52:22.202
And that humility, that simplicity and that
humility

00:52:22.403 --> 00:52:33.581
gives you the special edge which can
pierce into any heart.

00:52:35.792 --> 00:52:41.149
Thus you became apostles of Truth.

00:52:41.350 --> 00:52:47.500
You can become prophets like William Blake.
You can.

00:52:48.975 --> 00:52:55.372
So many things you’ll be manifesting
and you won’t believe yourself.

00:53:01.408 --> 00:53:04.438
But believe,

00:53:04.639 --> 00:53:14.016
you are one with that Great Power which
is God Almighty.

00:53:14.217 --> 00:53:22.932
They were discussing for ages I think,
about the immaculate conception of Christ.

00:53:23.133 --> 00:53:31.388
Such stupid people I’ve never seen.
But He is God!

00:53:31.697 --> 00:53:39.007
He is God Almighty, He is not a human
being! He can do anything!

00:53:44.339 --> 00:53:53.057
How can you judge Him? And judge
His powers and His working, how can you?

00:53:53.258 --> 00:53:58.248
To discuss about God, have you got
His brains?

00:53:59.304 --> 00:54:05.079
I mean, it’s something, a person like me
discussing about banking.

00:54:08.788 --> 00:54:15.235
Say, I - after say one or two sentences
I go off.

00:54:16.603 --> 00:54:20.934
In the same way, when you start
discussing God,

00:54:21.135 --> 00:54:29.798
you must know you do not have that capacity
to discuss about God,

00:54:29.999 --> 00:54:35.302
what His relations are, how He got a son,
this and that.

00:54:35.503 --> 00:54:45.098
Who are you? What’s your own position
that you can discuss?

00:54:47.912 --> 00:54:53.045
And then in that humility you realise:
He’s God Almighty.

00:54:54.163 --> 00:55:03.484
He’s Almighty. He can do anything!

00:55:04.519 --> 00:55:10.152
Then that faith, not blind,

00:55:10.353 --> 00:55:17.682
but a real faith in that feeling that God
is Almighty

00:55:18.118 --> 00:55:22.487
and that now you have become the messenger
of that God Almighty,

00:55:22.688 --> 00:55:30.195
gives you all the strength, all
the courage, everything.

00:55:31.222 --> 00:55:38.373
And His compassion, His love, His attention
and His understanding.

00:55:38.574 --> 00:55:46.650
So this faith should be absolutely one
with you.

00:55:47.221 --> 00:55:52.650
Once I went to meet one real guru.
Oh, he was a very horrid fellow otherwise!

00:55:52.851 --> 00:55:57.246
He has slapped so many people, thrown
so many people down from the hills

00:55:57.447 --> 00:56:00.078
and all that kinds of things he has done,
no doubt.

00:56:00.279 --> 00:56:06.239
But still for me he has tremendous regards.
I went to him,

00:56:06.905 --> 00:56:11.792
so he just started talking to me as if he
would talk to a Goddess.

00:56:11.993 --> 00:56:14.574
He said, “How do you find these worldly
people here?”

00:56:14.775 --> 00:56:18.850
I said, “All right, after all I have
created them.”

00:56:24.937 --> 00:56:28.078
“Ah but,” he said, “Still but, you are God,

00:56:28.287 --> 00:56:32.832
with your power why don’t you change
them a little bit?”

00:56:33.594 --> 00:56:37.470
I said, “That’s what is the problem. I have
given them freedom.

00:56:37.671 --> 00:56:42.499
I’ve said, ‘All right, it’s freedom to you.

00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:49.334
You can choose if you want to get
transformed or not,’ I cannot force.”

00:56:49.535 --> 00:56:54.483
He said, “But God Almighty you are,
you can do anything.”

00:56:54.990 --> 00:57:00.291
I said, “I can do everything, but I do not
want to do certain things;

00:57:00.498 --> 00:57:07.115
and one of them is to take away the freedom
from them.

00:57:07.316 --> 00:57:10.177
That is their freedom to choose.

00:57:10.378 --> 00:57:13.719
That’s given to them because, if they have
to have the ultimate freedom,

00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:17.800
they should have their, this little freedom
intact.”

00:57:19.929 --> 00:57:25.784
So he was quarrelling with me about this.
He said, “But when you are God Almighty

00:57:25.985 --> 00:57:32.325
there could be some other method!
These horrible people, what to do?”

00:57:33.388 --> 00:57:41.338
I said, “Your concern is all right and I
understand because you are a guru,

00:57:41.539 --> 00:57:48.808
but when I’m God Almighty supposing,
then my style is different.

00:57:49.009 --> 00:57:57.493
I can’t be like you.” Then he said,
“That’s true. You can’t be like me.”

00:57:59.036 --> 00:58:01.990
That is what I found in him.

00:58:02.191 --> 00:58:09.125
He was talking to me only as if I’m God
standing before him.

00:58:12.408 --> 00:58:17.430
And then see, he told all the disciples,
“You see, you praise, you praise the Lord,

00:58:17.631 --> 00:58:25.428
you praise Her, ‘suti kara’, because God
is fond of praise.”

00:58:26.254 --> 00:58:29.974
I said, “Really?” “Yes!

00:58:30.474 --> 00:58:33.903
If you praise the Lord then He gives you
everything, I’ve seen that.

00:58:34.104 --> 00:58:38.367
I always praise Him. Whenever I want
something to be done

00:58:38.568 --> 00:58:41.897
I just praise Him and He does it for me.”

00:58:43.683 --> 00:58:51.597
So, I said, “It’s true, I must accept.”
Because He’s bhakti gamya.

00:58:52.049 --> 00:58:57.772
You cannot get to Mother unless and until
you have really bhakti from your heart.

00:58:57.981 --> 00:59:06.136
Is all already sort of a built-in
restriction. What can I do?

00:59:06.337 --> 00:59:11.412
If you don’t have bhakti you cannot get
to Mother, no, you cannot.

00:59:11.613 --> 00:59:14.305
You cannot get to God.

00:59:15.067 --> 00:59:23.688
But if you have bhakti, then you can get
to Mother. Is written “bhakti gamya”.

00:59:24.324 --> 00:59:27.912
If somebody says, “All right. Raise
my Kundalini!”

00:59:28.113 --> 00:59:30.403
I cannot raise his Kundalini, not
[only that]

00:59:30.604 --> 00:59:34.674
but for seven lives he won’t have
realisation!

00:59:34.875 --> 00:59:41.302
But if somebody says, “Mother, will you
please give me realisation?” Once!

00:59:41.722 --> 00:59:48.491
So not only humility but bhakti. And bhakti
is only possible if you have your faith.

00:59:48.692 --> 00:59:52.390
That’s the thing is the faith, which is
challenged nowadays

00:59:52.591 --> 00:59:56.725
by all kinds of stupid people;
intellectuals, these horrible people

00:59:56.926 --> 01:00:00.481
who are taking out yarns out of their head,
or also by science

01:00:00.682 --> 01:00:06.296
and this so-called ‘Catholic Church’ and
this Church and that Church.

01:00:09.247 --> 01:00:19.962
So your faith in God has to be absolutely,
absolutely untarnishable.

01:00:20.163 --> 01:00:26.477
Nothing can disturb that. That’s very
important.

01:00:26.796 --> 01:00:29.093
You have seen all the miracles of God,

01:00:29.294 --> 01:00:35.983
you have seen how you’re working out
His powers,

01:00:36.184 --> 01:00:44.162
you have known all these things. But still
the faith in God is missing.

01:00:44.370 --> 01:00:48.863
The person who has complete faith in God
is called as the one…

01:00:49.069 --> 01:00:56.492
is God himself they say. Is called
as Paramachaitanya.

01:00:57.525 --> 01:01:07.678
The guru is called as the one who is
himself Brahmachaitanya.

01:01:09.938 --> 01:01:18.935
So when this faith in God is absolutely
established in you

01:01:19.136 --> 01:01:24.998
that, “There is God Almighty, He’s
Almighty,

01:01:25.206 --> 01:01:30.814
and that I am the messenger of that God.”

01:01:31.242 --> 01:01:37.071
Just this understanding, when it becomes
absolutely firm in you,

01:01:37.272 --> 01:01:40.976
then you are in the Gurupada.

01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:45.391
I bless you today that all of you achieve
that state

01:01:45.592 --> 01:01:50.381
that you reside in that Gurupada state.

01:01:50.582 --> 01:01:58.653
And wherever you are, whatever may be
your position, whatever you may do,

01:02:01.548 --> 01:02:08.852
the faith in the God Almighty that is
so truly within you will express itself.

01:02:09.053 --> 01:02:16.981
Not only [that] but that it will manifest,
it will act; just like God.

01:02:21.409 --> 01:02:26.517
So many things can be said. I’ve said
so many things before.

01:02:26.718 --> 01:02:30.843
And so many can be said later on also;

01:02:31.044 --> 01:02:37.917
but today we have to remember one thing,
that we must have complete faith

01:02:38.118 --> 01:02:42.740
in the Kingdom of God and in the powers
of God Almighty,

01:02:42.941 --> 01:02:49.390
complete faith, and then in ourselves.

01:02:50.156 --> 01:02:53.000
May God bless you all.
