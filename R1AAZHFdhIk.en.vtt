00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:25.750
what does look after all of us his

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:28.840
compassion his love he has created as he

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.670
has made a beautiful human being out of

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.500
us within us he has placed all these

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.270
centers he has placed the Kundalini

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.520
within us and the Kundalini has to rise

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:40.059
you have to get realization all that is

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:44.890
so no doubt all this has to work out

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:49.650
that's also it the truth is but still

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:53.890
one must know that he not in your hand

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:56.829
you are in his hand there are many

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.930
people who pray to God give me promotion

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:02.230
Oh God

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.760
you have to give me promotion and then

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:08.259
if he doesn't give this God is not

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.979
helpful to me why has he not given me

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:11.880
promotion

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:15.040
you should not cheap in God like that

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.399
God is the one who is almighty who has

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:21.000
created all this universe he has created

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:25.500
you and he has created you for a purpose

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.410
and that purpose is something supreme

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.899
that's not ordinary purpose the way you

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.550
think him to be he's not an ordinary

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:36.039
person

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.959
he's supreme and he will give you

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:41.470
something that is supreme supposing you

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:46.869
go to see some king he will not get give

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:51.369
you one piece really he may give you a

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:54.009
diamond but if you want to ask anything

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:58.840
from God then you must ask for the

00:01:54.009 --> 00:02:04.360
supreme now what is the supreme the

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:06.220
supreme is to know him unless and until

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:11.050
you know yourself you are not going to

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:13.270
know him he has placed within you that

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:17.170
instrument by which you first know

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:22.240
yourself once you know yourself through

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:25.120
yourself you know him but the first

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.730
important thing is that your attention

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.760
has to be on him there is a very

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.540
different thing to

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:36.379
attention on God and to have a blind

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:41.459
faith in God these two things are

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:44.250
absolutely far apart to have faith in

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.830
God means I have already told you all

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:51.170
the silly things we do in the name of

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:57.709
faith but to have your attention on God

00:02:51.170 --> 00:03:01.049
is to ask when am I going to be myself

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:04.709
when are you going to accept me as a

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:07.319
citizen of your kingdom when are you

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:10.230
going to use me as your instrumental

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:12.329
Lord this should be your attention if

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:16.769
your attention is like that and if you

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:20.040
are really of pure nature about it it

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:22.019
will work out it works out this is the

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:27.209
only thing that is needed in sahaja yoga

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:30.299
is a clean heart ask for it to desire

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:33.000
for it but today we have to understand

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:36.500
one thing that the essence is within us

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.349
for example innocence is absolutely pure

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:44.700
within us it is absolutely pure in its

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:47.190
own form it is absolutely pure but when

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:52.590
it is reflected through our medium it

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:55.290
gets all the way you are the way you

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:59.099
express it it gets spoiled if you are a

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:01.919
cunning person the innocence cannot be

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:04.079
para fest it cannot be manifested you

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:06.660
are in ourselves whatever God has placed

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:09.690
within you is completely darkened

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:13.829
because you cannot reflect it back there

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:19.200
is no manifestation about it why it

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:21.510
happens if you are pure if you are all

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.810
right the innocence is all right then

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.699
why it is not manifested through you why

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.310
these cunningness can stop that

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:31.050
innocence or any other essences that are

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.500
within you which you know which exists

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:38.520
on different chakras we must think about

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:42.840
it why it happens that even after

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.380
realization we cannot properly manifest

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:50.250
our in

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:53.460
since our primordial powers which are

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:57.300
within us in absolute purest form why

00:04:53.460 --> 00:05:01.590
what happens with us the trouble is with

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:04.410
our attention when you became human

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.630
beings you were given full freedom to

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:11.040
put your attention on to anything you

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:16.770
wanted say if you want you can put your

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:19.590
attention on to any subject so I receive

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.420
a telephone so I put my attention to it

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.400
now I can go on identifying with it

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.260
thinking about it all my attention will

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.120
be enveloped and I will not pay

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:33.240
attention to anything else that is

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:35.820
happening the attention is so mobile it

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.980
has no base as if the whole thing like a

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:40.470
journey goes and gets attached to a

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:42.750
thing I mean if you waste your attention

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:48.420
on foolish nonsensical things what's

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:53.400
going to happen so this is how we put

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:55.530
our attention on to absolutely useless

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:58.080
things sometimes known to many different

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:02.730
things also we may put our attention to

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:05.930
anything that we think requires our

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:09.360
attention but do you have your yourself

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:14.690
esteem if you have then where should be

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:19.970
your attention it should be on yourself

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:25.050
where is yourself now it is God Almighty

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:31.470
is a part of that great primordial P

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:33.540
your attention should be on that after

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:35.660
realization your attention should be in

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:41.250
your heart

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:44.190
on your spirit which is the part of God

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:47.640
Almighty if your attention is on your

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:50.910
spirit you will be amazed how your

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:53.490
attention will act you seem like a jolly

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:55.350
which is attached to a point it may

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:57.270
little bit get disturbed again it will

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:59.370
settle down again it will graduate

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:02.520
disturbed it will settle now it will not

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:07.290
hang on to any point and will not bother

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:09.900
you so to put all your senses properly

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:13.650
first of all put your attention to your

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:15.300
heart and through you spirit because

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:18.000
that's your absolute point which you

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:20.730
have discovered but it doesn't happen

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.570
with many people the trouble is when

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:26.250
Kundalini Rises she gives two kinds of

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:29.730
experiences one is called as shambhavi

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:32.760
another called is Shakti shambhavi is

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:36.900
the feeling of the Shambu is the shiva

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:40.710
in the heart means God Almighty but the

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:43.560
other is shift now with Western people

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:46.290
it is the other because you know your

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:49.320
problems you have used your powers for

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:52.230
all kinds of ramblings in your mental

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:54.270
efforts everything will sit down alright

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:59.310
let us discuss realization what are you

00:07:54.270 --> 00:08:02.280
going to discuss what are you going to

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:06.390
discuss about realization did you get

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:10.290
your realization by discussion how to

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:13.340
meditate you have to go within

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:15.840
yourselves see the world work out within

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:18.600
you cannot talk about it you cannot

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:22.950
discuss it you cannot argue about it it

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:25.170
is within because of his ramblings we

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:28.830
were up to the Shakti point but shadows

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:30.870
we do not reach not in the East where

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:34.950
people are not that much intelligent

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:38.520
that will educate it and sophisticated I

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:43.650
would say simple people it goes just

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:45.570
there and they just enjoy if you show

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:47.880
them any book written about sahaja yoga

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:49.350
example divorce book those were mother

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:53.280
we don't want it to read we don't

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:54.960
understand this there's a favor now

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:57.290
there what is there now flowing through

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:59.790
our body everything we know it's there

00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:02.250
why should we bother about these things

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:04.530
and all the controversies and dogmas and

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:06.690
what are the churches have told you and

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:10.040
why they have failed and why this region

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:10.040
has failed fools bother

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:18.140
so these problems come up because their

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:18.140
attention has been on the spirit of

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:26.400
simple people have that to capacity

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:28.470
so now forgetting everything else all

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:30.900
your intelligence all your books on

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:34.320
education and all that you have had

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:38.880
forget it and just put your attention to

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:42.180
your heart where lies the connection

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:46.620
with God Almighty if your attention is

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:50.460
there you will be surprised that your

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:52.710
attention will be stabilized not only

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:57.900
that it will be stabilized but the

00:09:52.710 --> 00:10:02.370
source of joy is that and you will start

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:04.890
feeling that job but if you want to

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:07.050
cooperate and help yourself then you

00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:11.400
have to put your attention in such a way

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:15.000
that every problem comes in you go to

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:17.490
your heart not to your brain any

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.580
question comes in go to your heart there

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:22.440
resides the blessings of God and you

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:23.910
will be surprised how it will be solved

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:26.370
that's why I said go into thoughtless

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:31.710
awareness that is the quality of heart

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:34.500
because heart doesn't think you go to

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:39.210
your heart means you put your attention

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:43.110
to your spirit you sahaja Yogi's have to

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:48.210
be people of higher outward

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:51.690
manifestation inside you are but outward

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:55.490
manifestation has to be higher you have

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:59.840
to be humble people kind of people

00:10:55.490 --> 00:11:03.180
sweeter people loving people

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:08.460
compassionate understanding that you are

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:12.660
there where they are today joyous people

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:14.310
and cheerful people otherwise nobody is

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:16.680
going to believe what is happening in

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:18.240
the Kundalini inside because whatever is

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:22.080
happening is happening you cannot see

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:24.120
that it is important that it should be

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:27.480
evident on you faith in

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:30.860
your behavior in everything for that you

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:34.230
have to understand that you have to

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:36.990
stabilize your attention at the lotus

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:40.410
feet of God this is called saranagati

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:46.670
surrendering by surrendering by

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:50.220
worshiping by bhakti by singing songs by

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:53.160
absolutely settling yourself at the

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:55.290
lotus feet of God already that's the

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:57.630
only way you are going to achieve it

00:11:55.290 --> 00:12:01.110
after realization only you have the
