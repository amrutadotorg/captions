1
00:00:10,667 --> 00:00:13,458
What's in? Come on, who is going to play that?

2
00:00:14,083 --> 00:00:14,667
That's great.

3
00:00:15,458 --> 00:00:16,208
Sit down. Sit down.

4
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:21,625
Ah, the roses are growing in sizes. Do you see that?

5
00:00:22,792 --> 00:00:24,667
Yogi: Huge, Mataji. They are huge.

6
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:26,542
But they are growing in sizes.

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,667
Your vibrations I think.

8
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:34,208
All right. So now.

9
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,667
I'm sorry we, we had to do this sully, [dumb] thing today.

10
00:00:40,792 --> 00:00:45,333
And because situations

11
00:00:47,417 --> 00:00:50,500
with the situations one has to exist,

12
00:00:50,709 --> 00:00:52,291
that is what is the situation is today.

13
00:00:52,959 --> 00:00:55,709
I may  not be able to come back for Krishna Puja

14
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:57,500
Navaratri

15
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:59,959
but - Navaratri, sorry, Navaratri

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
May not be, may be, I can't say.

17
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:04,959
But whatever it is.

18
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,208
We should have a little Puja.

19
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:12,667
That's what was the desire.

20
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:14,458
So we will do it.

21
00:01:14,667 --> 00:01:17,083
Now, only you, you have not much time.

22
00:01:17,709 --> 00:01:21,542
But you can say the mantras

23
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:24,208
and somebody can just wash My Feet

24
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:25,417
and then My hands.

25
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:28,375
You see it takes about five minutes to wash the Feet.

26
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:31,417
Yogi: Should we say Your hudred and eight names?

27
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:33,417
There's a translation in English.

28
00:01:33,667 --> 00:01:36,417
That we will. All right.

29
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:40,125
If you think so. But I think better is to say mantras, it's better,

30
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:43,625
The mantras of the chakras, you see.

31
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:46,291
It is better to say because

32
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,458
That also it's very important to say the mantras of the chakras

33
00:01:49,583 --> 00:01:50,500
Yogi: From the beginning?

34
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:51,959
No from the end, [yes]

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,667
So you say one and then repeat from one to another.

36
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:06,625
Now, start it.

37
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:07,999
Yogi: We can start with Shri Ganesha.

38
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:09,625
Ganesha, Shri Ganesha.

39
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:12,125
Yogi: Three times, Shri Ganesha

40
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:13,041
Yes, yes.

41
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,875
Just start pouring the water.

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,208

83
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:31,999

00:05:41,834 --> 00:05:47,375
Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

87
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,625
Then, Jagadamba.

88
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:53,417
Yogi: Shri Jagadamba, une fois.

89
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:59,166
Om Twameva Sakshat

90
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:03,208
Shri Jagadamba Sakshat

91
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:07,542

Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

93
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,917
Now, Krishna, Shri Krishna.

94
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:22,542
Yogi: Shri Krishna, une fois.

95
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:28,375
Om Twameva Sakshat

96
00:06:28,792 --> 00:06:32,417

Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

101
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:52,417
Om Twameva Sakshat

102
00:06:52,917 --> 00:06:56,166
Shri Rama Sakshat

103
00:06:56,792 --> 00:07:00,667
Shri Adi Shakti Mataji

104
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,750
Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

105
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:08,125
Now, Shiva.

106
00:07:08,667 --> 00:07:09,750
Yogi: Shri Shiva.

107
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:14,959
Om Twameva Sakshat

108
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,750
Shri Shiva Sakshat

109
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:23,125
Shri Adi Shakti Mataji

110
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:29,417
Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

111
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:33,417
Now... Jesus.

112
00:07:33,917 --> 00:07:34,917
Yogi: Shri Jesus.

113
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:40,417
Om Twameva Sakshat

114
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:44,250
Shri Jesus Sakshat

115
00:07:44,792 --> 00:07:48,583
Shri Adi Shakti Mataji

116
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:53,959
Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

117
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:55,083
Now, Virata.

118
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,625
Yogi: Shri Virata, une fois.

119
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:02,542
Om Twameva Sakshat

120
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,333
Shri VirataSakshat

121
00:08:06,834 --> 00:08:10,875
Shri Adi Shakti Mataji

122
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:16,999
Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

123
00:08:17,417 --> 00:08:18,083
Omkara.

124
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,333
Yogi: Shri Omkara.

125
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:25,166
Om Twameva Sakshat

126
00:08:25,667 --> 00:08:29,208
Shri Omkara Sakshat

127
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:33,458
Shri Adi Shakti Mataji

128
00:08:33,917 --> 00:08:38,917
Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

129
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,583
Now, Kalki.

130
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:46,375
Om Twameva Sakshat

131
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:50,291
Shri Kalki Sakshat

132
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:54,667
Shri Adi Shakti Mataji

133
00:08:55,083 --> 00:09:00,834
Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

134
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:02,792
Now, Nirmala.

135
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:08,834
Om Twameva Sakshat

136
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:12,750
Shri Nirmala Sakshat

137
00:09:13,417 --> 00:09:17,208
Shri Adi Shakti Mataji

138
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:22,583
Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

139
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:26,041
Now say the Sahasrara's mantras. Three.

140
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:27,709
Sahasrara Swamini

141
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,333
Moksha Pradayini

142
00:09:29,542 --> 00:09:31,041
Sahaja Yoga Dayini.

143
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:37,041
Om Twameva Sakshat

144
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:41,542
Shri Sahasrara Swamini

145
00:09:41,792 --> 00:09:46,208
Moksha Pradayini Mataji

146
00:09:46,667 --> 00:09:52,041
Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

147
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:53,166
Sahaja Yoga Dayini.

148
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:58,250
Om Twameva Sakshat

149
00:09:58,667 --> 00:10:04,417
Shri Sahaja Yoga Dayini Sakshat

150
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:08,792
Shri Adi Shakti Mataji

151
00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:14,917
Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

152
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:20,125
Now, after saying all these mantras

153
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,709
You have reached up to Sahasrara

154
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:28,250
and you have also pierced through the Sahasrara.

155
00:10:29,667 --> 00:10:34,500
The most effective mantra you know, is Nirmala.

156
00:10:35,542 --> 00:10:38,458
And that works the best for Sahasrara.

157
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:43,375
Now, one thing we must know, if somebody's Sahasrara is catching,

158
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,792
then such a person should be avoided.

159
00:10:46,917 --> 00:10:50,792
It is very easy to find out a person who catches Sahasrara.

160
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:54,208
We are not here to denounce anyone or to say "no" to anyone.

161
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:56,125
But you'll be amazed

162
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,125
if you come in contact with some of these people,

163
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,999
if you are not fully matured, you do catch.

164
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:03,458
And you start changing your temperament,

165
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:05,166
your nature, everything.

166
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:11,041
Now, for that we must understand anybody who is catching Sahasrara,

167
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,291
must be avoided.

168
00:11:14,542 --> 00:11:17,250
There is nothing to feel bad, just tell that person

169
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:19,500
that "your Sahasrara is catching

170
00:11:19,792 --> 00:11:23,000
and the best thing is that you clear out your Sahasrara".

171
00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:25,667
If your Sahasrara is catching that means

172
00:11:25,917 --> 00:11:27,500
"there is a barrier between you and our Mother,

173
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,500
and we don't want to know about you".

174
00:11:29,792 --> 00:11:32,250
So, for the time being till you clear your Sahasrara

175
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,542
you better not come to the ashram,

176
00:11:35,834 --> 00:11:37,458
better not come to the programme.

177
00:11:37,709 --> 00:11:38,583
Clear out yourself.

178
00:11:38,792 --> 00:11:41,375
Let us see if your Sahasrara it's cleared out.

179
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:44,625
I did not meet Martha but if you can pass them the thing

180
00:11:44,834 --> 00:11:47,709
that both of them were catching on their Sahasrara

181
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:51,792
when they came to the programme in India.

182
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:55,458
And they informed Me that their Sahasrara is very badly catching.

183
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,583
Actually I did not know what they were doing here,

184
00:11:57,792 --> 00:11:59,875
what was the problem till her letter came to Me.

185
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,500
But this is the main thing and not to feel bad

186
00:12:02,709 --> 00:12:05,166
because if your Sahasrara is catching and you come here

187
00:12:05,542 --> 00:12:07,583
then what happens you cannot improve

188
00:12:07,834 --> 00:12:09,417
because the bhoots won't leave you.

189
00:12:09,792 --> 00:12:11,999
And also the people who are here will be affected.

190
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,959
So, one thing one should remember, even her daughter-in-law

191
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,750
I must say you must avoid her.

192
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:21,000
Like I know I shouldn't say this but her daughter-in-law was

193
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,417
very much catching on the Sahasrara the other day I saw her.

194
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,875
So she has to be careful.

195
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:27,583
You should not tell her in a way that

196
00:12:27,792 --> 00:12:29,458
she should feel hurt, in any way, nothing.

197
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:31,166
I mean not that she's bad.

198
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,041
She's a good person, all of them are good.

199
00:12:33,417 --> 00:12:35,250
But if the Sahasrara is catching

200
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:37,667
she might be catching for Martha, she can be.

201
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:40,542
But she must clear it out by getting out of Martha

202
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,667
because this is one thing we have to remember

203
00:12:42,917 --> 00:12:44,834
that ashram must be kept pure.

204
00:12:45,792 --> 00:12:47,250
Ashram must be kept pure.

205
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,750
Then I would say that also Briggite,

206
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:52,000
your son, elder son, has a problem.

207
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:56,834
You better look after him and be, completely be in charge.

208
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,333
See how he behaves, because he has got something from his father,

209
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:01,917
which must be taken out.

210
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,041
So you look after him.

211
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:07,208
There is, what we have to do, everybody has to improve and improve.

212
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:10,792
Another is Andre. Andre you still you are not all right.

213
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:13,500
So you  have to put your left hand towards the photograph

214
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,375
with the light and put your right hand to the Mother Earth.

215
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:19,917
You see, if there are people who do not improve they should give up

216
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,375
because we cannot work it out.

217
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:23,875
So you please put your left hand towards the photograph

218
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,458
and right hand on the Mother Earth.

219
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,834
They should all improve.

220
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:29,667
And no use talking to other people because they catch

221
00:13:29,917 --> 00:13:31,999
and they get into trouble.

222
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,333
So what's the use of troubling others?

223
00:13:34,542 --> 00:13:36,959
The best is that you cure yourself, you should be all right.

224
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:41,041
There is no hatred, there is no anger, there's nothing.

225
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:43,333
It is just a simple understanding

226
00:13:43,542 --> 00:13:45,333
that just now there is an infection within us.

227
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:46,750
We should keep out from others.

228
00:13:46,999 --> 00:13:51,291
In Japan, if you go, even you may be the president of any place.

229
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,375
You see, one president of this Akai fellow, he came to see Me.

230
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:59,834
He had a big bandage just like a, I don't know, like Hanumana,

231
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:00,709
you see, big thing here.

232
00:14:00,917 --> 00:14:02,959
I said, "What is this?". I felt very funny.

233
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,125
You see, he came to see Me all the way

234
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:07,999
You see, a VIP, this that and here you come with that.

235
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,600
He said, "I'm sorry, I've got cold. I don't want to give you."

236
00:14:11,834 --> 00:14:12,750
Yogi: Sensitive.

237
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,125
Very sensible.

238
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:21,917
So in a way it is to be understood that we have been catching,

239
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:24,125
we have been doing wrong,

240
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:27,583
in the sense that we are meeting people when we are catching.

241
00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:30,625
So see that your Sahasraras are kept clear.

242
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:32,333
For that is very simple.

243
00:14:32,542 --> 00:14:34,959
You see I've seen miracles happening to people

244
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,375
when they know how to surrender entirely.

245
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:39,417
But if there is barrier in the heart,

246
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,000
the heart is not clean, you see,

247
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,542
then Sahasrara catches.

248
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,667
Because you know, it is heart chakra.

249
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:47,000
It is so made that is the heart chakra.

250
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:50,583
From the heart you must get to it.

251
00:14:50,834 --> 00:14:52,041
So that put Me in your heart,

252
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,875
put Me in your heart. It will work out.

253
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,667
But these people who are just on the periphery catch

254
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:57,875
very much from others.

255
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:00,250
So be careful not to catch.

256
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:03,000
If you catch try to beat yourself with shoes

257
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,125
or do something to get yourself all right.

258
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:08,999
And everybody should work it out that way so that you ascend.

259
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,959
If your quality improves a lot then there will be no problem.

260
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,166
Then another thing I've told here

261
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,709
that there are many old people who come to program.

262
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:20,125
So I've told Arneau, I've told all of you

263
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:27,917
that let Jaqueline and yeah, our Genevieve

264
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:30,083
and Madeleine, and all these people,

265
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:32,834
elderly people should all join together.

266
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:36,500
All join together, you look after them, talk to them.

267
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,917
Also eledrly men should join together

268
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:40,917
to talk to them because they like to talk,

269
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:44,291
come round, and this thing. They don't trust young people.

270
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:45,875
So you be careful on that.

271
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,333
And it will be very helpful if you can

272
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:53,250
first let them talk, let them take charge

273
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,166
and then gradually come to this.

274
00:15:55,417 --> 00:15:58,834
And there will be some very good news coming to you

275
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,125
about the ashram, I'm sure.

276
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,250
I bless you. May God bless you.

277
00:16:02,417 --> 00:16:04,917
Try to be in the ashram at least for two three weeks,

278
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,750
so that you learn certain disciplines.

279
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,667
And disciplines must be maintaned.

280
00:16:08,917 --> 00:16:10,333
Do not challenge Arneau for that.

281
00:16:10,667 --> 00:16:13,083
You must discipline yourself, there is an emergency,

282
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:16,999
and your disciplined life will tell everybody else that

283
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:18,166
it is going to work

284
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:21,583
You should not side with your sister, brother or anyone.

285
00:16:21,792 --> 00:16:23,959
You must side with the Divine.

286
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:26,959
So that you can cure brother, sister, everyone.

287
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:32,458
So try to work it out this way, that the whole thing cleanses.

288
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,041
Mother is cleaning you all the time.

289
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,041
Morning till evening I'm doing nothing but cleansing.

290
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:39,500
But you also should do some cleansing, isn't it?

291
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:40,999
That's very important.

292
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,917
So now I take your leave.

293
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,917
And there's, this is vibrated water.

294
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:48,917
You can use it for whatever you like.

295
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:52,041
I will vibrate that with My hand. [I won't be able to wash it.]

296
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:55,166
My hands with that.

297
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:59,834
And this one here, yes, this one you put it here. Just put it.

298
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:06,542
No, no, you put all that in here.

299
00:17:06,667 --> 00:17:07,625
Yogi: In the, in the big one?

300
00:17:07,834 --> 00:17:09,041
Yes.

301
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,083
No, no, no, no. This, all this.

302
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,333
This water can be removed.

303
00:17:18,542 --> 00:17:20,999
Yogi: Shri Mataji can we just put a garland on You? Just...

304
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,667
Yes, yes, while going I'll take it.

305
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:25,917
Can you bring some pot like this?

306
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,583
Something to wash My hands.

307
00:17:39,709 --> 00:17:42,999
Now some ladies should open the sari only to Me.

308
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:45,166
This sari has put a bondage on Me.

309
00:17:47,917 --> 00:17:50,041
Some seven ladies. Married ladies.

310
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,750
You give a sari to them and you take a fruit in that.

311
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,500
First let Me wash this you see, that is important.

312
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:11,834
Did you bring a pot?

313
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:16,500
That's too small.

314
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,583
That's it...

315
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:27,000
Just open. Look at this.

316
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:29,667
This is also you people are so lucky to get it.

317
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,125
You got it so cheap, do you know?

318
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,083
We paid eight hundred rupees for this sari.

319
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,083
Yogi: Seven hundread, Shri Mataji.

320
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,709
You can't believe it, you can't belive it, you see.

321
00:18:37,999 --> 00:18:40,125
You can't get it for less than three thousands.

322
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:44,750
You are people so lucky, you have no idea how lucky you are.

323
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,166
Just imagine.

324
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,959
Can you get such a sari?

325
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,208
The other way round. Just show them.

326
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,000
Now put it on Me.

327
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:54,458
Put everything on My hands.

328
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,208
Ghee a little. Little bit ghee. Little.

329
00:18:57,709 --> 00:19:01,792
Just a bit. Just a bit. That's all.

330
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:04,999
Now put all the...

331
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:09,583
Yogi: Curd? All of it?

332
00:19:09,834 --> 00:19:10,667
Yes, yes.

333
00:19:15,417 --> 00:19:16,834
Now put that.

334
00:19:18,792 --> 00:19:20,583
[Hindi/Marathi]

335
00:19:22,709 --> 00:19:24,208
You have more curd, na?

336
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:25,250
Yes, Shri Mataji.

337
00:19:25,417 --> 00:19:27,166
You have to put more curd.

338
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:33,166
Yes, it's all right. Now you pour it, the other.

339
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:34,583
Yogi: Milk?

340
00:19:34,792 --> 00:19:36,125
Milk, it's all right.

341
00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:44,750
The other should be this side.

342
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,542
Now, water.

343
00:19:57,999 --> 00:20:01,166
See the sari. This is your luck I tell you.

344
00:20:03,792 --> 00:20:06,750
I mean your wedding saris we bought

345
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:08,458
compared to that, look at this.

346
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,875
You be careful with mixing up with people.

347
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:20,667
You shouldn't come.

348
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,875
This is not all right. Get somebody else. All right?

349
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,291
I'm sorry but it is so.

350
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,375
Don't get friendly with her.

351
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,709
You see, it's a fraternity of bhoots.

352
00:20:28,959 --> 00:20:31,750
If there is a slightest bhoot in you it will combine another bhoot.

353
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,375
She will go down, you will go down.

354
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:35,208
Try to keep with positive people.

355
00:20:37,834 --> 00:20:40,125
Annie how are you? You are not all right.

356
00:20:40,709 --> 00:20:42,041
What's the matter with you?

357
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:49,999
Why? Les miserable?

358
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,375
Even more.

359
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:54,083
I don't know why it is so.

360
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:57,208
You should improve, you should see your vibrations, work it out.

361
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:58,999
You see so many years you have been with Me.

362
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:00,375
What will people think?

363
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:20,667
Now next time I'm not going to see such faces, all right?

364
00:21:20,792 --> 00:21:22,500
Everybody like a flower.

365
00:21:23,834 --> 00:21:25,125
What makes you look like that?

366
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:30,166
Work it out, see your vibrations, you know it very well.

367
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:33,333
Work it out. Marie has improved so much, you see.

368
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:35,834
What about you? You should improve also.

369
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,417
You have such a nice husband.

370
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,208
Or you are quarreling with him?

371
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:43,250
Are you? All right.

372
00:21:43,834 --> 00:21:45,000
It should work out I think.

373
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:49,542
You go on the right side too much, you think too much.

374
00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:51,583
You think too much. So just say Nirvichara,

375
00:21:51,792 --> 00:21:53,375
it's the mantra for you, Nirvichara.

376
00:21:53,709 --> 00:21:56,166
And for her, Vivian.

377
00:21:56,417 --> 00:21:59,417
Vivian, you must say the mantra of Sahasrara, all right?

378
00:21:59,709 --> 00:22:01,834
Om Twameva Sakshat Sahasrara Swamini. It will work out.

379
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,333
Still it is catching little bit,

380
00:22:03,542 --> 00:22:05,959
but it will work out. You are much better, no doubt.

381
00:22:08,542 --> 00:22:09,333
All right.

382
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:12,625
Bring it slowly.

383
00:22:19,542 --> 00:22:20,917
You have to put some rice.

384
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,125
No, I think you have to put it this way.

385
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:38,333
Ha, good.

386
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,041
Yogini: Rice, if You want to put it.

387
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:47,999
Ah?

388
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:49,500
Yogini: They went for rice, Shri Mataji.

389
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:50,166
Pardon?

390
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:52,500
Yogini: They went for rice. [unclear] with the rice.

391
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:04,542
Put the garland now.

392
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:08,667
But then rice should be fast because I take that...

393
00:23:17,542 --> 00:23:20,333
Everybody has improved, you see. Marie, might be an example,

394
00:23:20,583 --> 00:23:22,250
from where she has improved to what?

395
00:23:22,542 --> 00:23:24,250
There are people, tremendous people you have here

396
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,999
who have improved themselves with full confidence in themselves.

397
00:23:28,166 --> 00:23:30,417
Martin has improved so much. Everybody has improved.

398
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:32,875
Even she has improved so.

399
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,041
And Antoinette I'm very happy to see you this way.

400
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,750
She's so much confident, she's so sensible now.

401
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:42,750
Everybody must improve.

402
00:23:45,999 --> 00:23:46,834
All right.

403
00:23:51,417 --> 00:23:53,333
I'll try to arrange for your chidren

404
00:23:53,542 --> 00:23:58,333
if they can be looked after in some place in India,

405
00:23:58,583 --> 00:24:00,667
then those who have children can also travel.

406
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:03,959
I'll try. Although I don't promise but I'll try.

407
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:05,208
Hello, Shakti.

408
00:24:07,959 --> 00:24:09,166
May God bless you.

409
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:11,500
So now, where is the garland?

410
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,458
Beautiful.

411
00:24:23,583 --> 00:24:24,417
It's very beautiful.

412
00:24:25,834 --> 00:24:26,875
May God bless you.

413
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:29,417
Now take a photograph.

414
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,500
Everything to order.

415
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:34,834
In this short time what to do?

416
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:36,959
You cannot do much, you see, is as much as it is.

417
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:39,000
That's the problem.

418
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:41,834
Give her the photograph of Sahasrara.

419
00:24:42,375 --> 00:24:43,999
Another thing I found out

420
00:24:44,166 --> 00:24:46,667
if you can get the photograph of My feet,

421
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:48,375
which are nicely exposed,

422
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:49,999
you put it on the ground,

423
00:24:50,583 --> 00:24:55,834
bow to it and look at it without thinking.

424
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:57,959
That's a very good way of progressing.

425
00:24:58,125 --> 00:24:59,333
That's a surrender, all right?

426
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:14,709
Yogi: Complete Puja, Shri Mataji.

427
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,959
Fast. You see, you are very speedy people.

428
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:25,125
For India, they take four and a half hours.

429
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:28,542
And Switzerland only ten fifteen minutes to do this.

430
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,959
They are very speedy, you see. Telescopic.

431
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:33,750
Yogi: You should say that Shri Mataji to the Indian Sahaja Yogis

432
00:25:33,959 --> 00:25:37,125
who will be scold when You come to India, Shri Mataji.

433
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:41,166
No, no. They know that things can be very much,

434
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:44,709
complete effect is there. That's the main point.

435
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:00,875
Oh, let it be, let it be. Don't you worry.

436
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:10,542
This is the flower of dathura we call it. Is a...

437
00:26:11,875 --> 00:26:14,166
Like that, which is used for, little away,

438
00:26:14,375 --> 00:26:16,500
so that for Feet can be seen also.

439
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,999
The Feet must be seen.

440
00:26:35,709 --> 00:26:38,041
That sari did you keep or not for the background?

441
00:26:39,125 --> 00:26:41,166
I put it inside the one he liked.

442
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,542
Yogini: Oh, it's in the bag Shri Mataji.

443
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:44,583
I will take it out.

444
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:49,291
If she'll use it for a background, good idea.

445
00:26:51,333 --> 00:26:53,667
Yogi: Shri Mataji, we could, if the photograph it's good,

446
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:55,999
we could enlarge it because it is on the green,

447
00:26:56,166 --> 00:26:57,750
green color Your Feet.

448
00:26:58,166 --> 00:27:00,834
It's tremendous with the flowers, Shri Mataji.

449
00:27:01,458 --> 00:27:02,417
Should be nice.

450
00:27:02,792 --> 00:27:05,000
All right, take it one more. Good one.

451
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,291
Let it be, need not be there flowers, need not be.

452
00:27:09,458 --> 00:27:12,041
All right, doesn't matter they show, as long as My Feet show.

453
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:15,583
It's all right. [Now see. Don't put] Pull this out a little.

454
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:32,999
Good.

455
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,208
If you look at Them there's no swelling, you see?

456
00:27:37,375 --> 00:27:38,750
There's no swelling at all.

457
00:27:41,542 --> 00:27:42,792
All right. Take it here.

458
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,959
Yogi: I don't know if I can, Shri Mataji, pushing them.

459
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,667
All right. May God bless you all.

460
00:28:13,083 --> 00:28:16,166
It was very enjoyable, intense and beautiful

461
00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:17,875
and I don't know how the time passed.

462
00:28:18,875 --> 00:28:21,834
You all enjoyed. So be kind to everyone, be nice to everyone,

463
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,917
and don't say harsh words when you are with other people.

464
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:31,583
And Mona what about you? Are you all right?

465
00:28:31,999 --> 00:28:34,041
You still go up and down.

466
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,166
Yogini: Yes, Mother.

467
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:36,750
Now you study yourself.

468
00:28:36,999 --> 00:28:40,041
You have to become into Nirvikalpa. You see the boat is leaving.

469
00:28:41,208 --> 00:28:42,375
The boat is leaving.

470
00:28:43,125 --> 00:28:44,583
You have to come to Nirvikalpa.

471
00:28:44,917 --> 00:28:45,500
What's that?

472
00:28:45,709 --> 00:28:48,333
Yogini: From myself [?] Shri Mataji, to match with the tea set.

473
00:28:49,291 --> 00:28:52,250
From [name] handmade to match with the tea set.

474
00:28:52,458 --> 00:28:54,917
So you bring it with the tea set, all right?

475
00:28:55,125 --> 00:28:58,333
So sweet of you to have given Me that tea set, really.

476
00:28:58,542 --> 00:29:01,875
So sweet, it's so precious. I don't think I'll ever use it.

477
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,250
Is too good, too good to be used

478
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:08,250
too sweet. So beautiful. I mean what an idea.

479
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:11,083
What an idea.

480
00:29:16,125 --> 00:29:17,625
And the sari?

481
00:29:18,125 --> 00:29:19,625
Yogini: If you put in your bag Shri Mataji?

482
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,875
All right. And take out that another sari, all right?

483
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,709
Very well, Shri Mataji.

484
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:38,750
You feel very sad, isn't it?

485
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:43,875
I'll feel very sad, leaving you all here.

486
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,667
But we are going to meet for Guru Puja.

487
00:29:46,917 --> 00:29:47,999
At least make it for Guru Puja.

488
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:51,000
All of you should be there for Guru Puja, all right?

489
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:57,083
Yogi: Shri Mataji, could we sing Your aarti while you are leaving?

490
00:29:57,417 --> 00:29:59,792
Yogi: Could we sing Your aarti while You are leaving?

491
00:30:00,083 --> 00:30:02,625
All right, sing.

492
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:59,917
Aum Twameva Sakshat

493
00:35:00,625 --> 00:35:11,166

Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

508
00:36:32,083 --> 00:36:33,709
May God bless you.

509
00:36:44,417 --> 00:36:47,999
Yogi: Shri Mataji, we all the Sahaja Yogis here,

510
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:50,667
we pray to You and we promise You

511
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:55,917
that we will be one, just one flower,

512
00:36:56,208 --> 00:36:58,709
so that when You can see us,

513
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:06,458
You will see only one flower, one color, one perfume,

514
00:37:06,959 --> 00:37:11,709
and one flower offered at Your Divine Lotus Feet.

515
00:37:12,041 --> 00:37:18,500
And we pray Shri Mataji in our heart that Your Divine Lotus Feet

516
00:37:18,875 --> 00:37:25,333
will dwell forever in our beings. Amen. Jai Shri Mataji.

517
00:37:25,542 --> 00:37:27,458
Jai Shri Mataji.

518
00:37:50,583 --> 00:37:52,458
I want to thank you all very much

519
00:37:52,667 --> 00:37:54,667
for the gifts, [Didier] for your gift and others,

520
00:37:54,917 --> 00:37:56,250
all those who have given Me gifts

521
00:37:56,458 --> 00:37:59,125
thank you very much for all that. May God bless you.

522
00:38:03,291 --> 00:38:04,583
Now enjoy yourself.

523
00:38:04,999 --> 00:38:07,250
Hope to see you all very soon.

524
00:38:07,999 --> 00:38:09,917
I'm going with a heavy heart

525
00:38:10,083 --> 00:38:15,792
but I hope at Guru Puja it will be all cleared out.

526
00:38:16,375 --> 00:38:18,709
May God bless you. Thank you very much.
