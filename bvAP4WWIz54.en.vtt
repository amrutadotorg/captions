Final draft: Transcription of Shri Mataji’s
talk:

00:14.270 --> 00:15.270
SAHASRARA PUJA
4 MAY 1997

00:15.270 --> 00:16.270
CABELLA

09:26.649 --> 09:39.728
Today we all have assembled here to worship
the Sahasrara.

09:39.728 --> 10:01.439
As you have realised that Sahasrara is a very
important part of the subtle system.

10:01.439 --> 10:16.578
Of course this is a great day in 1970 that
this Chakra was opened up, but by that what

10:16.578 --> 10:20.729
you have achieved we have to see it.

10:20.729 --> 10:40.528
First of all when the Kundalini rises She
goes to your Void where is your dharma, and

10:40.528 --> 10:51.889
your dharma gets established at the Nahbi
Chakra, we can say, around the Nabhi Chakra.

10:51.889 --> 11:00.778
Your dharma gets established which is the
innate Pure Universal Religion.

11:00.778 --> 11:03.479
It’s established.

11:03.479 --> 11:08.899
But then the Kundalini rises higher.

11:08.899 --> 11:19.419
Despite the establishment of the dharma we
start becoming little bit aloof from other

11:19.419 --> 11:27.259
societies because we find they are amiss,
they have no dharma.

11:27.259 --> 11:33.659
Also, I think we are afraid that we might
get caught up with their adharmas.

11:33.659 --> 11:44.109
So, at that stage we don’t want to cross
the limits of Sahaja Yoga, want to keep to

11:44.109 --> 11:51.929
Sahaja Yogis, to Sahaja Yoga programme, and
to our personal Sahaj life.

11:51.929 --> 12:02.769
Of course, it is important because first this
Chakra must be fully nourished, and this Chakra

12:02.769 --> 12:09.228
is actually moves around the Nahbi Chakra
which we know as Swadisthana.

12:09.228 --> 12:19.719
This Swadishtan Chakra is in a way very important
because it supplies energy to the brain.

12:19.719 --> 12:33.169
So when dharma is established the subtle energy
pushes through the Kundalini more energy for

12:33.169 --> 12:46.948
the Sahasrara, and also the energy for dharma
which was in the Sahasrara, the Swadistana

12:46.948 --> 12:49.419
also starts flowing with it.

12:49.419 --> 12:59.559
It crosses over and starts rising in the Sahasrara.

12:59.559 --> 13:09.919
Till then we are, I would say, we are not
yet full Sahaja Yogis because one can become

13:09.919 --> 13:12.809
fanatic about Sahaja Yoga.

13:12.809 --> 13:20.129
I have seen people who are so fanatic that
they cannot even meet people who are not Sahaja

13:20.129 --> 13:26.719
Yogis, they cannot even talk to people who
are not Sahaja Yogis, and all the time they

13:26.719 --> 13:32.709
are frightened of meeting people who are not
Sahaja Yogis.

13:32.709 --> 13:38.969
Of course you need not meet people who are
evil, people who are against Sahaja Yoga,

13:38.969 --> 13:47.328
who talk against it, but those who are seeking
the truth, it is our duty that we have to

13:47.328 --> 13:49.809
go to them.

13:49.809 --> 14:01.809
So when it reaches the state where it is established
in the brain, that time we go beyond dharma.

14:01.809 --> 14:06.129
Dharmateet - we become beyond.

14:06.129 --> 14:14.539
Dharma means that dharma becomes part and
parcel of our being, we cannot lose it.

14:14.539 --> 14:24.839
Sahaj dharma becomes within us a part and
parcel which is a very great achievement because

14:24.839 --> 14:30.989
then you don’t have to do any rituals, you
don’t have to worry about meeting other

14:30.989 --> 14:41.459
people, you don’t have to worry that your
vibrations will be harmed.

14:41.459 --> 14:51.518
Then you don’t catch from anyone, you don’t
catch also other negative forces.

14:51.518 --> 14:55.219
No one can harm you.

14:55.219 --> 15:01.459
That I call as the completion of your Shradha.

15:01.459 --> 15:11.559
That time Sahasrara is so fully englightened
that you become dharma.

15:11.559 --> 15:19.629
For example, we can give the example of Christ.

15:19.629 --> 15:24.078
Christ saw a protistute being stoned.

15:24.078 --> 15:27.839
Now Christ had nothing to do with the prositute,
I mean just the opposite of it.

15:27.839 --> 15:40.059
But when He saw she was stoned He took a stone
in His hand, and He says that those who think

15:40.059 --> 15:46.339
who have not sinned at all can throw a stone
at Me.

15:46.339 --> 15:55.009
And everyone was standing: Why is He taking
the side of a protistute.

15:55.009 --> 15:57.489
He is a religious man.

15:57.489 --> 16:02.269
He should also put stones on her.

16:02.269 --> 16:05.569
But He was standing on truth.

16:05.569 --> 16:13.078
That’s exactly what happens to you when
it is established in Sahasrara, in Sahasrara,

16:13.078 --> 16:14.999
that you stand on truth.

16:14.999 --> 16:25.369
There's a little difference in the, I would
say, in dharma and in truth.

16:25.369 --> 16:34.629
A dharma person might become too dharmic,
illogically dharmic and go to the right or

16:34.629 --> 16:36.579
to the left.

16:36.579 --> 16:47.978
A dharmic person might think he is the superior
person to others: that why should he be trying

16:47.978 --> 16:53.018
to save anybody else, let them go to hell,
who cares.

16:53.018 --> 16:58.319
This kind of an attitude can come in a person
who is dharmic.

16:58.319 --> 17:05.509
Also I have seen some Sahaja Yogis who start
new methods in Sahaja Yoga.

17:05.509 --> 17:10.418
You do like this it will be alright, you do
like that it will be alright, because they

17:10.418 --> 17:16.509
are not stagnated at the point of dharma,
so they start telling people that you do this

17:16.509 --> 17:18.388
way do that way.

17:18.388 --> 17:25.379
But when you rise to the point of truth, then
you don’t do any rituals, you don’t need

17:25.379 --> 17:36.209
any rituals, you are not bothered, because
you are in dharma and here you are standing

17:36.209 --> 17:41.709
on the truth, and truth is much greater than
dharma.

17:41.709 --> 17:53.608
For example, a person who is standing on truth
- he doesn’t care for any absurd ideas about

17:53.608 --> 17:57.608
religion even about Sahaj religion.

17:57.608 --> 18:05.539
He doesn’t care that after all this is Sahaj
this is not Sahaj, he goes beyond.

18:05.539 --> 18:09.539
In the sense he sees a global truth within
himself.

18:09.539 --> 18:19.139
He sees the truth which is all pervading,
not only sees but he knows and he feels and

18:19.139 --> 18:23.749
he is in that truth.

18:23.749 --> 18:31.749
So when dharma flowers into truth it’s a
very beautiful happening and that should happen

18:31.749 --> 18:35.789
to all of you.

18:35.789 --> 18:41.579
So many things can linger on if you are only
on the dharma level.

18:41.579 --> 18:48.669
I have seen people going into ego, making
money.

18:48.669 --> 18:53.819
Sometimes they don’t even ask me and go
on doing things which they should not do.

18:53.819 --> 18:58.989
They do wrong things which are not good for
Sahaja Yoga.

18:58.989 --> 19:10.009
There is no humility about it and they don’t
understand that whether this dharma is standing

19:10.009 --> 19:13.279
on truth or untruth.

19:13.279 --> 19:19.609
So we have to go to the foundation of dharma
which is truth.

19:19.609 --> 19:26.949
As described before it’s a tree of life
which has got its roots in the brain and the

19:26.949 --> 19:29.249
branches in the body.

19:29.249 --> 19:36.239
So you have to go to the roots of everything
and that is the place where you reach when

19:36.239 --> 19:40.079
you are absolutely established in Sahasrara.

19:40.079 --> 19:53.939
In the Sahasrara are the roots of all these
ideas we have, or we can say, all these swarupas

19:53.939 --> 19:57.189
we have taken.

19:57.189 --> 20:00.079
We have now become dharmic.

20:00.079 --> 20:02.609
What is the root of dharma?

20:02.609 --> 20:08.029
Why should we be dharmic?

20:08.029 --> 20:09.449
What is the need to be dharmic?

20:09.449 --> 20:14.909
There are many people in this world who are
extremely adharmic living very well.

20:14.909 --> 20:20.979
According to, I mean, outward expression we
feel that they are very happy people, they

20:20.979 --> 20:29.059
are alright they are enjoying themselves while
we are deprived perhaps of all the so-called

20:29.059 --> 20:32.579
enjoyments of these people.

20:32.579 --> 20:44.459
So at the state of only dharma things become
very important to us which are, may not be

20:44.459 --> 20:46.529
standing on truth.

20:46.529 --> 20:52.879
There are so many things like that I can point
it out to you that how Sahaja Yogis faulter,

20:52.879 --> 20:56.709
even after acheiving dharma state they faulter.

20:56.709 --> 21:09.979
I have seen people giving up their drugs,
alcoholism, giving up other kinds of addictions,

21:09.979 --> 21:11.929
even their language improves.

21:11.929 --> 21:22.669
And their, we can say, behaviour is changed,
they become humbler people no doubt, but still

21:22.669 --> 21:27.839
they are conscious that they are standing
on dharma.

21:27.839 --> 21:32.999
This consciousness has to disappear.

21:32.999 --> 21:51.819
At the state of Sahasrara this consciousness
disappears because truth is love and love

21:51.819 --> 21:54.439
is truth.

21:54.439 --> 22:01.089
That is the point where the Kundalini meets
the Heart Chakra.

22:01.089 --> 22:05.109
As you know the pita of heart is here.

22:05.109 --> 22:14.269
So when Kundalini pierces through that Heart
Chakra, what starts flowing in the brain,

22:14.269 --> 22:20.799
in the Sahasrara is the truth, but truth that
is love.

22:20.799 --> 22:29.089
There’s a difference between truth as itself
and truth that is love.

22:29.089 --> 22:35.059
So out of love for that prostitute that Christ
stood by her.

22:35.059 --> 22:46.359
He stood on the roots of truth no doubt, but
what was flowing through His heart was the

22:46.359 --> 22:49.949
love, the pure love.

22:49.949 --> 22:58.689
So now when we have pure love for someone,
we see the whole thing in a different manner,

22:58.689 --> 23:07.149
we see a person in a different manner and
it becomes very sweet.

23:07.149 --> 23:21.389
Otherwise truth can be very bitter, can be
very painful, but truth which is adorned with

23:21.389 --> 23:26.319
love is just like a flower without the thorns.

23:26.319 --> 23:38.349
It’s very interesting how a person who is
pouring with love and is standing on truth

23:38.349 --> 23:43.789
- that’s the personality you have to become.

23:43.789 --> 23:52.569
Now in the expression of love we can take
an example to understand.

23:52.569 --> 23:59.459
Supposing I meet somebody and he is telling
all kinds of horrible things about another

23:59.459 --> 24:02.829
person.

24:02.829 --> 24:09.789
So I feel tremendous love for him as well
as for the person whom he is telling all these

24:09.789 --> 24:10.789
things.

24:10.789 --> 24:21.989
So now I take to lie, a complete lie, which
is a truth, also in a way.

24:21.989 --> 24:26.169
I tell that person, see what are you talking.

24:26.169 --> 24:32.149
The person about whom you are saying all this
had been just praising you all the time and

24:32.149 --> 24:34.879
here you are talking like this.

24:34.879 --> 24:43.759
Now this is not the truth actually, but you
take the help of the lie, the other side of

24:43.759 --> 24:50.809
the truth, to bring out a friendship between
the two persons.

24:50.809 --> 25:00.109
So this is what is the work of love, that
it tries to bring people closer to each other:

25:00.109 --> 25:10.259
to say things by which they become one, united.

25:10.259 --> 25:17.879
So all the divisive methods that we have used
so far just disappear and we try to understand

25:17.879 --> 25:29.119
what is the method by which we can join people’s
heart.

25:29.119 --> 25:35.820
As it is you are in collective consciousness,
but this collective consciousness, if it is

25:35.820 --> 25:46.199
supericial you can achieve great results like
as you have done it - maybe you can build

25:46.199 --> 25:51.439
beautiful ashrams, you can do all this.

25:51.439 --> 26:02.039
But when it is filled with love, collective
consciousness, then the joy is complete of

26:02.039 --> 26:06.299
collective consciousness.

26:06.299 --> 26:09.629
Now people talk of peace.

26:09.629 --> 26:16.039
You cannot have peace without this new awareness
we call it collective consciousness, but in

26:16.039 --> 26:27.338
that also there has to be the main tattwa,
principle of love.

26:27.338 --> 26:38.919
For example now, Sahaja Yogis say from Germany
and Austria are going to Israel - it is very

26:38.919 --> 26:39.919
fulfilling.

26:39.919 --> 26:49.989
I was happy that they have chosen for this
Puja people from Israel, and then I found

26:49.989 --> 26:59.549
Israelies coming to Egypt forgetting all that
Muslims had done to them.

26:59.549 --> 27:08.719
It’s really remarkable how people get attracted
towards expression of their love, to their

27:08.719 --> 27:17.429
fellow men, to other Sahaja Yogis, and once
it starts growing you will be surprised how

27:17.429 --> 27:20.539
we can change this world.

27:20.539 --> 27:31.939
Most of the problems, human problems, are
due to hatred and is very commonly used - I

27:31.939 --> 27:38.139
hate, I hate, it’s absurdity, it’s a sin
to hate someone.

27:38.139 --> 27:41.369
Why do you hate someone.

27:41.369 --> 27:48.099
You can hate the sin, you can hate the evil,
but you should not hate people just for hating

27:48.099 --> 27:49.549
sake.

27:49.549 --> 27:57.019
This hatred that we have is responsible for
all the problems we have had so far.

27:57.019 --> 28:04.559
Because one person becomes very powerful,
by dividing people he becomes very powerful,

28:04.559 --> 28:11.079
and these divisive things have really crushed
so many countries.

28:11.079 --> 28:20.509
For example our country was divided by the
British, now they are having the division.

28:20.509 --> 28:23.949
This doesn’t stop.

28:23.949 --> 28:26.139
By dividing us what has happened?

28:26.139 --> 28:32.119
All the countries who have gone away from
India are suffering very much.

28:32.119 --> 28:38.019
Those people who tried to divide the country
thought that they’d become prime ministers,

28:38.019 --> 28:39.289
this that.

28:39.289 --> 28:43.879
Most of them have been murdered by their own
people.

28:43.879 --> 28:47.769
You can see clearly how hatred manifests itself.

28:47.769 --> 28:57.409
It starts from a small point and it manifests
all over, very clearly it can be seen in any

28:57.409 --> 28:59.689
country being divided.

28:59.689 --> 29:08.789
There’s no need to divide any country - that
creates more hatred and more trouble.

29:08.789 --> 29:19.819
In the same way in Sahaja Yoga we should not
think of have divisions.

29:19.819 --> 29:28.359
Now we have got a beautiful land – as that
you must have heard about near to Ganges.

29:28.359 --> 29:37.019
Now people are thinking if they can have separate
houses, separate compounds.

29:37.019 --> 29:40.759
Why?

29:40.759 --> 29:46.499
You know how to live collectively, you enjoy
collective life, so why do you want to have

29:46.499 --> 29:49.659
separate houses?

29:49.659 --> 29:52.419
What secrets are we going to have from each
other?

29:52.419 --> 30:01.789
After all whatever we do is known on the vibrations
- you cannot hide anything, so why have separate

30:01.789 --> 30:02.889
houses.

30:02.889 --> 30:09.699
Why do you want to have some privacy, because
in Sahaja Yoga there is no privacy.

30:09.699 --> 30:18.409
We know about everyone, what are they up to,
what are their problems, what chakras they

30:18.409 --> 30:19.479
are catching.

30:19.479 --> 30:20.559
Isn’t it?

30:20.559 --> 30:24.789
So there is no secret about anything in Sahaja
Yoga.

30:24.789 --> 30:31.219
Everyone knows about everyone, so what’s
the use of having privacy - also I can’t

30:31.219 --> 30:32.219
understand.

30:32.219 --> 30:39.759
It’s like this you see still the mind is
working like that.

30:39.759 --> 30:43.449
Then they are thinking of inheritance.

30:43.449 --> 30:52.369
Alright, I was saying that you can have inheritance,
but if your son is not a Sahaja Yogi, what

30:52.369 --> 30:53.369
to do.

30:53.369 --> 31:01.289
We cannot keep a culprit there to trouble
everyone.

31:01.289 --> 31:09.919
It is not the rules and regulations that are
going to keep you happy and joined together,

31:09.919 --> 31:16.499
but it is the pure collective consciousness
and its love.

31:16.499 --> 31:24.289
Because as you know we have no proper organisations,
we have no clergyship, we have nothing like

31:24.289 --> 31:25.289
that.

31:25.289 --> 31:30.979
Leaders also can shift more times than Ganges
River can shift its course.

31:30.979 --> 31:32.469
So there is nothing like that.

31:32.469 --> 31:38.899
It’s all on a shifty sand we are standing,
all the time, and your Mother is another one

31:38.899 --> 31:42.239
who tries all kinds of tricks.

31:42.239 --> 31:54.959
The reason is I want you to stand on rocks
and this rock is emitting love, is emitting

31:54.959 --> 32:06.889
that Divine Love, and the joy of that love
is really so beautiful.

32:06.889 --> 32:13.219
For example, people would like to have their
separate bathrooms, specially Indians, suddenly

32:13.219 --> 32:18.319
they have become Britishers and Britishers
have become Indians you know.

32:18.319 --> 32:24.779
Indians want to have their separate bathrooms
- I don’t know why, and uh, this is a very

32:24.779 --> 32:27.329
common disease with Indians.

32:27.329 --> 32:33.189
And it is also spreading to other people I
feel sometimes that they want to have their

32:33.189 --> 32:36.049
separate bathrooms.

32:36.049 --> 32:38.659
In a collective life there is no need.

32:38.659 --> 32:45.669
You don’t even know, if you ask me I won’t
even know if I have been to bathroom or not,

32:45.669 --> 32:48.129
just go there come back, finished.

32:48.129 --> 32:53.589
I have no time for all that.

32:53.589 --> 33:03.399
In the same way you also should have a concept
of a society which is living like a ocean,

33:03.399 --> 33:08.209
if ocean rises they rise, it falls they fall
- just one [unison?

33:08.209 --> 33:09.209
union?

33:09.209 --> 33:11.159
Sounds like "unigon"] of Love.

33:11.159 --> 33:21.429
I am expecting that kind of a society at the
foothill of Himalayas, and I am sure you all

33:21.429 --> 33:28.579
of you realise that Himalaya being the Sahasrara
of the world.

33:28.579 --> 33:37.219
Luckily I wanted it to be done before the
Sahasrara Puja and it is done, with the blessings

33:37.219 --> 33:39.829
of Himalayas I should say.

33:39.829 --> 33:47.879
The Himalaya is also like the Sahasrara where
the Kundalini has risen, where the vibrations

33:47.879 --> 33:52.999
have come out, and in the sky you can see
the vibrations.

33:52.999 --> 34:04.429
But this Himalaya is ruled by a wrathful God
called Shiva - that’s the dangerous part

34:04.429 --> 34:06.249
of it.

34:06.249 --> 34:10.809
So we have to be very, very careful.

34:10.809 --> 34:25.959
If we try to play around, if we try to
take to hatred among ourselves, take to divisive

34:25.959 --> 34:36.559
methods, take to something that is not Sahaj,
this wrathful God is sitting on our head.

34:36.559 --> 34:42.849
He’s also in Mecca, this is Mecaisha Shiv
there.

34:42.849 --> 34:48.469
If you try to misbehave he comes out with
his wrathfulness.

34:48.469 --> 34:55.159
Anywhere where you are you have to be very
careful that this Shiva is everywhere.

34:55.159 --> 35:07.910
Like one of these Lingas of Shiva is in [Perlybaithnath?],
that is in Maharastra, Alahathur, and there

35:07.910 --> 35:15.839
people started another kind of Sahaja Yoga,
also they were drinking on the day of the

35:15.839 --> 35:30.159
Shri Ganesha’s celebrations, so the wrath
of Shivalinga came and there was such a big,

35:30.159 --> 35:32.879
huge earthquake.

35:32.879 --> 35:43.149
Many people were lost but none of the Sahaja
Yogis, and their centre was saved completely.

35:43.149 --> 35:49.909
Now we had a big fire also as you know last
time and nothing happened to you, you are

35:49.909 --> 35:51.249
under protection.

35:51.249 --> 35:54.219
You are all the time protected.

35:54.219 --> 36:00.329
There was no wrath of Shiva that could work
out anything.

36:00.329 --> 36:04.049
Fire could not do anything to you because
you are under protection.

36:04.049 --> 36:08.929
But this protection is your Mother’s love.

36:08.929 --> 36:15.769
It’s not anything else but the love of your
Mother, which is very powerful, and which

36:15.769 --> 36:18.999
is protecting you and helping you.

36:18.999 --> 36:26.188
In the same way you develop that kind of love
for others, for other Sahaja Yogis, for other

36:26.188 --> 36:31.629
people, for other things, for this Mother
earth, for all that.

36:31.629 --> 36:39.569
Your love can not only protect you but protect
others also.

36:39.569 --> 36:45.949
Your attention as long as it is on yourself
will start becoming smaller and smaller.

36:45.949 --> 36:51.439
I should have this, I should have that, I
like this, I like that.

36:51.439 --> 36:54.699
All these topics will fall.

36:54.699 --> 36:59.869
You’ll never say ‘I like this’.

36:59.869 --> 37:02.129
No question.

37:02.129 --> 37:03.199
What do I like?

37:03.199 --> 37:11.829
It is difficult for me to decide if I like
anything - this I like, that I like, I like

37:11.829 --> 37:13.749
to be this way.

37:13.749 --> 37:14.789
Who are you?

37:14.789 --> 37:18.279
Ask yourself the question.

37:18.279 --> 37:20.829
Who are you?

37:20.829 --> 37:30.829
If you are the pure spirit it is nothing but
love, and in love you think of others, the

37:30.829 --> 37:38.099
problems of others, you try to make others
comfortable, you try to look after others

37:38.099 --> 37:43.549
and you don’t just look after yourself and
bother about yourself.

37:43.549 --> 37:45.649
This is what you have to reach.

37:45.649 --> 37:51.609
Though you may be dharmic, you may be in every
way Sahaj, but still, unless and until you

37:51.609 --> 38:01.039
reach that state in your Sahasrara, I wouldn’t
say that you are alright.

38:01.039 --> 38:02.899
You have to work it out.

38:02.899 --> 38:10.429
For that, of course, meditation is very important,
but the thing that stops it is your mind.

38:10.429 --> 38:14.229
It's your mind that goes on telling you.

38:14.229 --> 38:18.269
All the time you watch your mind how it tries
to guide you.

38:18.269 --> 38:25.709
How it tries to tell you - now what about
me, what about my house, what about my children,

38:25.709 --> 38:28.979
what about my country.

38:28.979 --> 38:35.289
Like that you go on ‘my, my, my, my, my’
- ultimately you end up into nothing.

38:35.289 --> 38:42.159
But when you say ‘you, you, you’ - Kabira
has said a beautiful thing about it.

38:42.159 --> 38:52.609
He says that when the goat is living it is
saying: ‘Meh, meh, meh’ which means I,

38:52.609 --> 38:53.959
I, I.

38:53.959 --> 39:02.938
But it dies, then they take out the intestine
and put in on a dunkih, where they put it

39:02.938 --> 39:07.009
for the cleaning of the cotton.

39:07.009 --> 39:13.688
And that time what does that dunkih say: ‘Tuhi,
tuhi, tuhi’ - you are the one, you are,

39:13.688 --> 39:19.739
you are, you are - and that he calls all over.

39:19.739 --> 39:25.009
In the same way you have to think from other’s
point of view.

39:25.009 --> 39:32.579
First of all tuhi when you say, you say it
to your Guru or to God that you are - I am

39:32.579 --> 39:39.499
no more, I am dissolved, I am finished, I
have become one with this ocean of love.

39:39.499 --> 39:49.259
And then you say to others: ‘you are, you
are’ that is Sahaj Culture.

39:49.259 --> 39:58.109
See, so lots of falsehood will follow - falsehood
that surrenders you and others.

39:58.109 --> 40:06.709
Like people try falsehood by saying something
‘I love you very much’ and on the back

40:06.709 --> 40:09.679
they plan something very bad.

40:09.679 --> 40:12.438
They can do anything.

40:12.438 --> 40:16.949
Not Sahaja Yogis they don’t do it, I must
say, that they have reached the stage where

40:16.949 --> 40:18.439
they don’t do it.

40:18.439 --> 40:22.549
But still if they don’t do it they are conscious
of it.

40:22.549 --> 40:30.429
All the time they are conscious, we don’t
do this, we don’t drink - so what, we don’t

40:30.429 --> 40:32.039
fuss about food.

40:32.039 --> 40:38.769
I mean all their things they have achieved
they are very proud of it, you see very proud

40:38.769 --> 40:42.019
- that we are like this, we are that.

40:42.019 --> 40:49.569
You see, because you are the pure spirit,
because you are that, so you have become that.

40:49.569 --> 40:53.749
How can you take pride in something what you
are?

40:53.749 --> 40:58.829
Like somebody asked me: don’t you feel very
proud that you are the Adi Shakti?

40:58.829 --> 41:02.579
I said ‘What?’

41:02.579 --> 41:04.469
I couldn’t understand the question.

41:04.469 --> 41:10.240
I said see now, if I am Adi Shakti what is
there to be proud, because I am that, what

41:10.240 --> 41:11.879
is there to be proud?

41:11.879 --> 41:17.929
If I was not that then I would be proud of
it, but I was, so what is there to be proud

41:17.929 --> 41:18.999
of.

41:18.999 --> 41:26.529
Like the sun, it shines, it’s not proud
that ‘I am the sun’, or if you are born,

41:26.529 --> 41:35.509
say, with your eyes and nose, a face like
a human being, you are not proud: I'm a human

41:35.509 --> 41:38.899
being, I'm a human being - are you proud?

41:38.899 --> 41:47.678
In the same way if you are that what you are,
you are not proud, you are not conscious of

41:47.678 --> 41:50.879
it, not at all conscious.

41:50.879 --> 41:54.799
I mean, I never tell myself I am Adi Shakti,
there’s no need to tell.

41:54.799 --> 41:56.399
But it is so, what to do.

41:56.399 --> 42:01.949
Now God has chosen me, I should say, to be
Adi Shakti, alright, I can have it.

42:01.949 --> 42:07.729
But I just don’t know what is there - as
if like some people think that, Sahaja Yoga

42:07.729 --> 42:14.909
has been bestowed upon them like some Lordship
or something like that.

42:14.909 --> 42:24.599
It is what you have become - when you become,
you must understand that you have become that.

42:24.599 --> 42:34.438
Like supposing a stone becomes gold, then
it is gold, it won’t be proud that ‘I’m

42:34.438 --> 42:35.438
gold’ - gold is gold.

42:35.438 --> 42:38.759
Why will it be proud of that?

42:38.759 --> 42:48.129
In the same way this consciousness of being
a Sahaja Yogi drops off.

42:48.129 --> 42:54.649
Still it lingers - so one has to be careful
that once you are a Sahaja Yogi, you are a

42:54.649 --> 42:56.289
Sahaja Yogi - so what.

42:56.289 --> 43:01.219
I am a Sahaji , so what, nothing so great.

43:01.219 --> 43:08.109
It’s like saying that I have a nose, you
see, and be proud of saying I have a nose.

43:08.109 --> 43:13.808
Nose is already there, what is there to be
proud of - But this pride has to go.

43:13.808 --> 43:21.688
That’s very important to realise that I’m
not there, I’m no more - I’m one of the

43:21.688 --> 43:28.808
whole - become the ocean this drop of mine
- I don’t know if there are any boundaries

43:28.808 --> 43:30.359
left in me.

43:30.359 --> 43:36.739
This kind of consciousness develops in you,
when your consciousness is filled with joy

43:36.739 --> 43:43.409
- just with joy and bubbling with love - bubbling
with love.

43:43.409 --> 43:54.278
You go on see expressing your love, whether
you talk or you don’t talk, whether you

43:54.278 --> 44:04.589
say about it or you don’t, whether you are
smiling or not, this joy is in your heart.

44:04.589 --> 44:18.339
Now the Heart Chakra here, the pita of the
Heart Chakra, gets filled with light of truth,

44:18.339 --> 44:26.589
but the truth is not such an absurd thing
that we know of as truth is.

44:26.589 --> 44:30.149
For somebody asked me what is the truth.

44:30.149 --> 44:40.139
So I said that it was written long time back,
that you should speak the truth and speak

44:40.139 --> 44:47.279
something that people will like - Satjamvadeth
priyamvadeth.

44:47.279 --> 44:51.159
Then people said, how can you make this truth.

44:51.159 --> 44:59.209
Truth may not be palatable and could be something
that you say which people like, and may be

44:59.209 --> 45:03.729
false, so how to make these two things meet.

45:03.729 --> 45:12.889
So Krishna gave a very good answer, He said
it’s like this: Satyamvadeth, hitamvadeth,

45:12.889 --> 45:13.889
primamvadeth.

45:13.889 --> 45:21.449
You say the truth, truth you must say, but
that truth should be good, or should be liked

45:21.449 --> 45:30.059
or should be appreciated or should be nourishing
for your spirit, by which there is benevolence

45:30.059 --> 45:36.579
which creates benevolence, and then it has
to be priya.

45:36.579 --> 45:43.049
In the beginning, people may not like and
say that ‘he said horrible things to me’

45:43.049 --> 45:51.179
or whatever it is - but at the end of it he’ll
say that see, it’s so good that this was

45:51.179 --> 45:55.149
said to me that I have done something perfect.

45:55.149 --> 46:02.839
But in any case there is no need to say something
very harsh or hard to anyone.

46:02.839 --> 46:08.969
That is not your job to go on correcting all
the rest of the people.

46:08.969 --> 46:13.729
To begin with, many Sahaja Yogis, I have seen,
have been saying: you’ve got this chakra

46:13.729 --> 46:15.929
caught up, you’ve got that chakra caught
up.

46:15.929 --> 46:19.639
All this is the play of ego.

46:19.639 --> 46:24.699
You have no business to condemn anyone, you
have come from such a condemned condition

46:24.699 --> 46:27.929
yourself, so why are you condemning others.

46:27.929 --> 46:35.169
Only thing is if you are capable, if you are
equipped, if you are matured enough in Sahaja

46:35.169 --> 46:43.359
Yoga, then you will just take it up as a great
challenge of love and you will do it.

46:43.359 --> 46:47.800
But you won’t go on condemning that person,
finding faults with that person, it’s a

46:47.800 --> 46:52.529
very good excuse if you don’t want to do
it.

46:52.529 --> 46:58.509
Supposing somebody is sick and the doctor
doesn’t know how to cure, so what does he

46:58.509 --> 46:59.509
do?

46:59.509 --> 47:05.319
He says you see you are sick because this
happened, because you went in the cold.

47:05.319 --> 47:11.119
Because this haribaba yes, but now I am sick
so now what about curing me.

47:11.119 --> 47:16.239
No, because you did this, because you did
that, you should not have done this.

47:16.239 --> 47:19.139
All about the past mistakes, he’ll go on.

47:19.139 --> 47:25.849
In the same way we go on: that you did like
this, you were like this, you went to the

47:25.849 --> 47:31.099
falara guru, you did this kind of a mistake,
that’s why you are like this.

47:31.099 --> 47:36.079
No, don’t tell him anything, just work it
out and it works.

47:36.079 --> 47:42.738
Of course, you can ask if he has been to some
guru, but don’t condemn, don’t criticise,

47:42.738 --> 47:48.649
there is no need to condemn anybody for what
mistakes they have committed.

47:48.649 --> 47:53.909
This is all coming from the consciousness
that you are better equipped, that you have

47:53.909 --> 47:55.359
all the knowledge.

47:55.359 --> 48:01.849
You have, you are very knowledge people, I
must say very knowledgable.

48:01.849 --> 48:11.449
You are the gnostics, all that I accept, but
as long as you are aware of it you are not.

48:11.449 --> 48:20.069
Once you are not aware of it then you are
that what is called Sahaja Yogi.

48:20.069 --> 48:26.899
So I would expect all of you to have this
new development in their Sahasrara, in your

48:26.899 --> 48:29.929
Sahasrara, in everybody’s Sahasrara.

48:29.929 --> 48:31.829
We have to think of the whole world.

48:31.829 --> 48:35.880
We cannot just think of Sahaja Yogis and also
about the seekers.

48:35.880 --> 48:40.470
Seekers are there, alright, but what about
the rest.

48:40.470 --> 48:44.519
There are so many problems there and so many
things are to be done.

48:44.519 --> 48:50.059
For example, now we have a problem in India
of poverty.

48:50.059 --> 48:52.849
So I am trying to do something for them.

48:52.849 --> 48:55.729
You have problems in your countries.

48:55.729 --> 48:58.709
You should find out what problems there are.

48:58.709 --> 49:05.238
You can start some sort of a movement for
them, try to help them as far as possible.

49:05.238 --> 49:12.119
It’s not missionary like, that you convert
somebody for some sort of a reward or for

49:12.119 --> 49:17.679
some name you have to do - you just do it
for your pleasure, because it’s your pleasure

49:17.679 --> 49:18.829
to do it.

49:18.829 --> 49:23.659
That’s how you'll go to the society and
you won’t be afraid that you'll be caught

49:23.659 --> 49:24.659
up.

49:24.659 --> 49:30.238
I know of one couple, when I asked them, why
don’t you start working it out.

49:30.238 --> 49:33.329
So they said ‘Mother we are afraid our ego
will come back’.

49:33.329 --> 49:38.239
They are afraid of themselves only - their
ego will come back.

49:38.239 --> 49:44.709
So all these problems should be dropped out
and you should reach that state where you

49:44.709 --> 49:51.079
don’t have all these fears, all these non-sensical
ideas about yourself.

49:51.079 --> 49:53.189
You are powerful.

49:53.189 --> 49:55.199
You have powers.

49:55.199 --> 49:59.069
Not only that, but you have been specially
bestowed with those powers.

49:59.069 --> 50:02.699
But if you don’t want use it then what are
you?

50:02.699 --> 50:10.429
If the lamp is not enlightened what is this
lamp for - just for decoration?

50:10.429 --> 50:17.228
So this has to be used, and this has to be
used without feeling that awareness within

50:17.228 --> 50:24.309
you that you are something great, better than
others, something selected, or also they say

50:24.309 --> 50:28.199
that we are chosen.

50:28.199 --> 50:35.319
So, this can spread very fast with such grace
and understanding.

50:35.319 --> 50:40.479
All kinds of stupid people are there, it’s
alright, you know they are stupid - just laugh

50:40.479 --> 50:45.429
at them, make fun of them and that’s how
you can solve the problem.

50:45.429 --> 50:51.809
But even that, you should do it in such a
way that you don’t hurt them, that whatever

50:51.809 --> 50:56.899
you do you should see from the results what
works out.

50:56.899 --> 51:09.099
Results should be such that you should see,
how it works out.

51:09.099 --> 51:13.589
With some people - that’s the intelligence,
I think that’s the superior intelligence

51:13.589 --> 51:20.269
by which you know how to say things, what
to say things and how to work it out.

51:20.269 --> 51:30.599
Love, this Divine Love, gives you a complete
control over yourself, and you know everything,

51:30.599 --> 51:36.759
how to behave, how to talk to people, how
to manage them.

51:36.759 --> 51:44.709
I don’t know what is the worst thing among
human beings.

51:44.709 --> 51:55.199
According to Krishna it was temper - hot temper
was the worst thing, but according to me it

51:55.199 --> 51:59.399
is jealousy.

51:59.399 --> 52:06.089
Jealousy of any kind is absolutely, I should
say, like a scum.

52:06.089 --> 52:14.419
In Sahaja Yoga also people feel jealous and
they may not say so because I don’t like

52:14.419 --> 52:22.259
it, but they may create problem, they may
try to create problem among each other.

52:22.259 --> 52:28.609
So one thing you should have a watch on your
mind if there is any kind of jealousy.

52:28.609 --> 52:36.139
I’m rather worried sometimes - supposing
I want to give some present to some people,

52:36.139 --> 52:43.189
then I’m worried that I shouldn’t do something
that will create jealousy.

52:43.189 --> 52:47.189
We should not.

52:47.189 --> 52:54.169
Mother might have forgotten, or it’s alright
she’s running short of it - it’s alright.

52:54.169 --> 53:01.849
But people have that kind of a very sharp
sense of jealousy when in Sahaja Yoga.

53:01.849 --> 53:07.619
Now supposing I meet somebody and I don’t
meet somebody else - finished.

53:07.619 --> 53:12.879
That person developes a jealousy for that
person whom I meet.

53:12.879 --> 53:16.799
Sometimes people pester me too much - ‘Mother,
I must meet you, I must meet you’.

53:16.799 --> 53:19.549
I don’t know why, why do you want to meet
me.

53:19.549 --> 53:25.149
I’m all over, everywhere as you say.

53:25.149 --> 53:30.679
Then what is the need that you should meet
me and talk to me - what is the need?

53:30.679 --> 53:38.209
It’s not for you alone I am, I’m for everyone,
but some people think that they have a special

53:38.209 --> 53:45.579
right on me and they think that I must meet
them indivdually, otherwise they feel very

53:45.579 --> 53:46.579
bad.

53:46.579 --> 53:54.419
All these things have to go away in a big
way when you become as I said, the ocean.

53:54.419 --> 54:01.709
Then you are not bothered what shore you go,
where you travel, you are not bothered, you

54:01.709 --> 54:05.719
are only with the ocean moving up and down.

54:05.719 --> 54:14.189
That is how it’s a living ocean of love,
and that’s what we have to develop it- without

54:14.189 --> 54:20.709
dominating others, without showing off.

54:20.709 --> 54:28.719
It should be, the whole thing should be contented
within ourself.

54:28.719 --> 54:37.839
In Hindi it is said better: Apneme ...(hindi...ndt).

54:37.839 --> 54:46.789
Should be all within yourself and that’s
the most enjoyable thing.

54:46.789 --> 54:55.369
Because see what we want, supposing I want
something for myself, you see, so I’ll strive

54:55.369 --> 54:56.849
and get it.

54:56.849 --> 55:06.719
But this is something if you have within yourself,
you fully filled within yourself.

55:06.719 --> 55:11.759
So what is most important, what is so much
needed?

55:11.759 --> 55:13.549
Nothing!

55:13.549 --> 55:26.929
You are completely filled with yourself, contented
with yourself, and then you want to share.

55:26.929 --> 55:36.569
This is the ideal way of dealing with Sahasrara,
I think, and I am sure the day will come this

55:36.569 --> 55:43.149
whole world’s Sahasrara has to be opened
out.

55:43.149 --> 55:49.439
This is what we have to do it, and we are
not going to disappear into some exclusive

55:49.439 --> 55:57.829
places that is just for meditation - you can
go there, but not for escaping the world.

55:57.829 --> 55:59.389
That is not the idea.

55:59.389 --> 56:07.399
Idea is for meditation, for your growth - it
would be a nice place to go to.

56:07.399 --> 56:24.099
It is very important to understand how valuable
you are, how remarkably important you are

56:24.099 --> 56:33.069
- born at this time, got your realisation
for what?

56:33.069 --> 56:44.228
To emancipate this world, to transform human
beings, to take whole of this world into the

56:44.228 --> 56:45.799
realm of God.

56:46.039 --> 56:48.100
That is what you are here for.

56:48.389 --> 56:50.070
May God bless you.
