WEBVTT

00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:01.590
Adi Shakti Puja

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:02.930
2004, Cabella Ligure, İtalya

00:11:01.007 --> 00:11:06.549
Today's meeting is very special.

00:11:07.549 --> 00:11:10.715
It's a very, very special day also,

00:11:10.882 --> 00:11:18.216
extremely special and very blissful.

00:11:20.049 --> 00:11:28.216
The reason is, it talks and sings and says

00:11:29.508 --> 00:11:41.216
about the born Order

00:11:41.424 --> 00:11:47.799
born Power,

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:56.424
the Original, the Adi, the Primordial.

00:11:57.633 --> 00:12:01.715
And this one is responsible

00:12:01.924 --> 00:12:08.633
for creating this great universe.

00:12:10.508 --> 00:12:17.757
Why this has started and how it works out is...

00:12:17.965 --> 00:12:20.341
already you know;

00:12:20.549 --> 00:12:22.965
I need not talk about that.

00:12:24.132 --> 00:12:28.466
But today we have to talk about this Power,

00:12:30.341 --> 00:12:34.341
which is hidden in your hearts,

00:12:35.341 --> 00:12:40.341
by which you can do whatever you like to create

00:12:40.633 --> 00:12:46.341
a new world, a new family,  a new standards,

00:12:46.633 --> 00:12:49.965
everything that is not known so far.

00:12:52.091 --> 00:12:57.049
That is quite possible;

00:12:59.341 --> 00:13:04.132
that is quite possible and is being done,

00:13:04.341 --> 00:13:08.216
but what is difficult is

00:13:08.383 --> 00:13:15.091
how to make people more adaptable, more

00:13:19.882 --> 00:13:24.924
in tune with each other, absolutely.

00:13:25.257 --> 00:13:30.924
It seems to be a difficult thing.

00:13:31.924 --> 00:13:34.633
They're all right among themselves,

00:13:34.882 --> 00:13:38.757
if they are own friends, their own styles and things.

00:13:39.091 --> 00:13:45.840
But to make them absolutely one, one with each other

00:13:46.049 --> 00:13:52.383
in one tune, in one line is very, very difficult

00:13:52.591 --> 00:13:55.299
and it should not be done.

00:13:55.591 --> 00:13:58.049
That's not supposed to be;

00:13:58.341 --> 00:14:01.132
they're not supposed to be like that,

00:14:01.341 --> 00:14:06.132
but it has to work out.

00:14:06.715 --> 00:14:08.633
Now the problem is,

00:14:11.965 --> 00:14:16.965
we have beautiful people, beautiful souls,

00:14:18.257 --> 00:14:19.633
but they do not become

00:14:19.965 --> 00:14:24.257
so one with each other as they should have.

00:14:25.007 --> 00:14:28.799
Now, how to solve this problem?

00:14:28.965 --> 00:14:30.757
Many people have asked Me,

00:14:31.049 --> 00:14:35.840
"Mother, how to make that problem";

00:14:36.049 --> 00:14:37.508
I just smiled.

00:14:38.508 --> 00:14:42.466
Because, if you see the original idea

00:14:42.757 --> 00:14:52.049
why we started this x ray

00:14:52.341 --> 00:14:55.174
why we started this new kind of a

00:15:00.466 --> 00:15:06.757
understanding, new kind of penetration -

00:15:07.049 --> 00:15:14.549
because we wanted to find out the oneness, the newness

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:16.091
in every person.

00:15:16.715 --> 00:15:23.091
Now you should be very much thankful that

00:15:23.299 --> 00:15:27.882
you are all one, one inside,

00:15:28.091 --> 00:15:30.049
there's nothing second.

00:15:30.341 --> 00:15:36.007
There's only one and that one when it speaks

00:15:36.216 --> 00:15:41.924
and when it wants to administer something,

00:15:42.424 --> 00:15:47.341
then you'll be amazed that it's all done the same way.

00:15:47.549 --> 00:15:52.466
It's the same thing and it works out the same way.

00:15:52.965 --> 00:15:58.424
There is no change, there's no difference between the two.

00:15:59.633 --> 00:16:07.174
Despite that, despite that, our minds are roving,

00:16:07.466 --> 00:16:10.549
roving into some sort of a problem,

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:15.049
which has no significance in Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:17.216 --> 00:16:21.757
Now the main problem that we have is that

00:16:22.049 --> 00:16:24.549
we don't realize that we have no problem.

00:16:26.757 --> 00:16:29.299
We are without any problems.

00:16:29.799 --> 00:16:31.341
We think that there are problems and

00:16:31.633 --> 00:16:33.257
we should deal with problems,

00:16:33.466 --> 00:16:36.633
but there are none; none of those problems are there.

00:16:36.924 --> 00:16:38.965
I don't see any problem anywhere.

00:16:40.007 --> 00:16:42.132
Those who think they have problems,

00:16:42.466 --> 00:16:44.549
I've asked them to write it down,

00:16:44.757 --> 00:16:46.633
and I'll try to answer them

00:16:46.924 --> 00:16:50.049
and tell them what sort of a problem it is.

00:16:50.216 --> 00:16:53.840
But before I could do anything, I would like to say

00:16:54.633 --> 00:17:00.132
that still our Sahaja Yogis are not come to that level

00:17:00.424 --> 00:17:04.466
to understand the oneness, the uniqueness

00:17:05.757 --> 00:17:10.757
in their hearts of their oneness.

00:17:10.965 --> 00:17:18.049
All this comes from within, not from without,

00:17:18.924 --> 00:17:23.091
so all efforts made outside is of no use.

00:17:23.757 --> 00:17:29.091
We have to be effortless and become what we are.

00:17:29.591 --> 00:17:31.840
There you'll find  there is no... nothing.

00:17:32.007 --> 00:17:40.007
There is no need to have another... another meeting or

00:17:40.508 --> 00:17:43.633
any other coding something,

00:17:43.924 --> 00:17:46.840
no need; it's all there.

00:17:47.049 --> 00:17:50.299
Just you have to be that, to become that.

00:17:50.508 --> 00:17:53.466
This is rather difficult to understand for people

00:17:53.757 --> 00:17:58.840
who have different noses, different faces, different everything,

00:17:59.132 --> 00:18:00.757
to become the same.

00:18:01.049 --> 00:18:03.383
But you are, you are; because

00:18:03.591 --> 00:18:07.715
you don't know that you are that's why you are looking different.

00:18:08.049 --> 00:18:12.633
So, I have to tell you one thing:  that you are all One.

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:20.466
One in the sense that your everything,

00:18:20.674 --> 00:18:25.257
impulse, every feeling,

00:18:26.257 --> 00:18:33.257
every understanding is the same.

00:18:35.049 --> 00:18:39.508
Only thing is that it arises at a wrong time,

00:18:39.715 --> 00:18:44.341
at different times and it gives you a wrong impression

00:18:44.633 --> 00:18:48.840
that it is different, but actually it is not.

00:18:49.132 --> 00:18:53.049
It is only one, one relationship,

00:18:53.216 --> 00:18:58.383
and the relationship is with the Adi Shakti

00:18:58.549 --> 00:19:03.633
- that you are a part and parcel of Adi Shakti;

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:06.633
that whatever one may try,

00:19:07.965 --> 00:19:10.965
one cannot get separated from Adi Shakti.

00:19:11.174 --> 00:19:16.924
You are born out of Her and you are guided by Her,

00:19:17.924 --> 00:19:19.799
you are looked after (by) Her.

00:19:20.383 --> 00:19:23.757
Everything seems to be one to Me

00:19:23.965 --> 00:19:26.549
while you people think there is a different

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:30.924
line of a course, line of action, which is wrong.

00:19:33.216 --> 00:19:35.674
Whatever I may say, it has to be proved,

00:19:36.007 --> 00:19:43.174
otherwise why should you accept such a ghastly statement?

00:19:47.132 --> 00:19:51.174
Myself, I am one with you

00:19:51.383 --> 00:19:56.174
and I am always... will remain the same with all of you.

00:19:56.383 --> 00:20:01.840
For Me there is no difference. I don't see anything like that.

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:06.591
It's outside; it's only your clothes and your style.

00:20:06.924 --> 00:20:13.216
Inside, maybe, what temperament you have,

00:20:13.424 --> 00:20:15.299
depends on your temperament.

00:20:16.424 --> 00:20:19.466
If that temperament changes a little bit,

00:20:19.633 --> 00:20:23.174
you will see the oneness among all of you

00:20:23.549 --> 00:20:27.508
and the differences will be lost in no time.

00:20:28.508 --> 00:20:31.174
Today I saw a very dangerous man.

00:20:31.174 --> 00:20:35.049
I thought he can kill Me if he wants.

00:20:35.341 --> 00:20:41.424
He can do whatever he likes. But no, it didn't happen.

00:20:41.757 --> 00:20:45.174
Why? Because I never understood him.

00:20:45.257 --> 00:20:51.299
He was not like that.  He just wanted to show his respect.

00:20:51.299 --> 00:20:55.174
He didn't want to kill Me or didn't want to do anything wrong.

00:20:55.466 --> 00:20:59.216
It's very surprising how you understand each other.

00:20:59.424 --> 00:21:03.299
Unless and until you have proper understanding of each other,

00:21:03.466 --> 00:21:08.174
you cannot achieve anything that is sober [Not clear],

00:21:08.508 --> 00:21:15.633
that is essential, that is right, that is the truth.

00:21:16.965 --> 00:21:19.383
So, the truth started long time back,

00:21:19.508 --> 00:21:27.341
much before anybody could think of having a truth here.

00:21:27.466 --> 00:21:35.424
It's all went off with so many things which were not truthful

00:21:35.633 --> 00:21:38.508
and then the truth went away.

00:21:38.715 --> 00:21:41.965
Like, I would say, that the snake...

00:21:42.257 --> 00:21:48.174
snake was born out of ignorance

00:21:48.882 --> 00:21:51.715
that the other snakes started supporting.

00:21:52.341 --> 00:21:56.508
Snakes after snakes,  they started growing up

00:21:56.674 --> 00:22:03.508
and filling the whole universe with dishonesty and with wrong ideas

00:22:03.508 --> 00:22:07.840
and believing in it and started fighting,

00:22:08.049 --> 00:22:11.341
killing each other. But they were all snakes.

00:22:11.424 --> 00:22:17.715
So how much one should believe in their nonsense?

00:22:17.799 --> 00:22:21.174
How much one should follow their nonsense?

00:22:21.216 --> 00:22:26.674
How much anybody should accept their nonsense?

00:22:26.674 --> 00:22:28.508
It's very difficult.

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:32.924
But it is acceptable much more than the truth.

00:22:33.257 --> 00:22:40.591
The truth is not so very easily accepted as the untruth is.

00:22:40.715 --> 00:22:42.257
Why?

00:22:42.383 --> 00:22:46.007
- Because we are standing in untruth.

00:22:46.216 --> 00:22:49.091
Our own understanding is untruth

00:22:49.257 --> 00:22:52.965
and we'll have to change our understanding to truth,

00:22:53.341 --> 00:22:59.091
which is not difficult because we are truth. We are the truth.

00:22:59.174 --> 00:23:03.715
To become the truth, which we are, why should it be difficult?

00:23:03.715 --> 00:23:06.466
Should not, but it happens.

00:23:06.757 --> 00:23:08.965
So that means there is something wrong

00:23:09.257 --> 00:23:12.466
somewhere within us, which we should find out.

00:23:12.633 --> 00:23:14.882
And the thing that isnwrong with us,

00:23:15.174 --> 00:23:19.383
within, is that we cannot face ourselves.

00:23:19.549 --> 00:23:22.549
We cannot face ourselves.

00:23:22.799 --> 00:23:25.757
We face others, not ourselves.

00:23:25.924 --> 00:23:28.840
We never see ourselves.

00:23:29.007 --> 00:23:35.965
We have no idea as to what our own situation is.

00:23:36.049 --> 00:23:41.007
And for that is only you needed a Mother - to show you.

00:23:41.341 --> 00:23:44.383
And that's how the Mother came here

00:23:44.591 --> 00:23:50.882
on this earth to tell you what's the problem with you, within.

00:23:50.882 --> 00:23:56.840
This one is to be accepted. This principle has to be practised.

00:23:57.007 --> 00:24:00.132
And you'll be amazed at yourself

00:24:00.424 --> 00:24:03.633
how much you have already a knowledge

00:24:03.924 --> 00:24:07.049
about yourself and about all the surroundings.

00:24:07.049 --> 00:24:11.799
There's nothing so special, nothing so extraordinary,

00:24:12.007 --> 00:24:16.299
but only thing is you have to be acceptable to yourself.

00:24:16.299 --> 00:24:24.257
I think people are becoming Sahaja Yogis,

00:24:24.466 --> 00:24:26.341
but they are not.

00:24:26.466 --> 00:24:30.007
They are not Sahaja Yogis but they are trying to become.

00:24:30.007 --> 00:24:34.091
On the contrary, they should know that they are Sahaja Yogis

00:24:34.257 --> 00:24:36.174
and they don't have to become anything.

00:24:36.299 --> 00:24:38.424
Then there's no problem.

00:24:38.715 --> 00:24:41.799
But when you have accepted that there is

00:24:43.007 --> 00:24:47.007
Sahaja Yoga different, and Sahaja Yogis are different

00:24:47.299 --> 00:24:48.591
and you are different,

00:24:48.799 --> 00:24:51.508
then how can you become Sahaja Yogis?

00:24:51.508 --> 00:24:58.757
The thing is the ignorance, is the ignorance that we have,

00:24:58.965 --> 00:25:03.383
that we are behaving like strangers towards each other.

00:25:03.424 --> 00:25:07.799
Complete ignorance. We have to know that we are all,

00:25:08.091 --> 00:25:10.091
all the same, very much.

00:25:10.174 --> 00:25:14.216
There's no need to have any ignorance of any kind.

00:25:14.633 --> 00:25:19.007
And when that happens, the problems of the whole world

00:25:19.299 --> 00:25:21.799
will be solved without any difficulty.

00:25:22.508 --> 00:25:25.174
Today's Puja is a special one

00:25:25.383 --> 00:25:28.799
because you are doing the Puja of something

00:25:29.091 --> 00:25:31.007
that never went into any transformation,

00:25:32.007 --> 00:25:37.924
which was not changed at all; it was just the same,

00:25:38.216 --> 00:25:43.091
remained the same, born with the same and is still with the same.

00:25:43.383 --> 00:25:47.549
In such a Puja, what do I have to say?

00:25:47.715 --> 00:25:49.840
Why anyone has to say?

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:53.591
Nothing. Just be one with yourself.

00:25:53.799 --> 00:25:56.007
That's the point we come to

00:25:56.049 --> 00:25:59.007
- that we have to be one with ourselves,

00:25:59.299 --> 00:26:02.715
and not to get it lost in the words

00:26:02.924 --> 00:26:09.591
or in the atmosphere or in the other... our movements of brain.

00:26:09.757 --> 00:26:13.132
Because, this is the time when the brain starts moving;

00:26:13.132 --> 00:26:17.674
and when it starts moving, it loses its control over himself.

00:26:17.674 --> 00:26:23.715
Like a snake - unless and until it is in its own place,

00:26:24.049 --> 00:26:25.633
there's no danger;

00:26:26.257 --> 00:26:30.091
but as he starts moving, there's a danger to him.

00:26:30.216 --> 00:26:33.965
In the same way, we have to know that our mind is

00:26:34.174 --> 00:26:39.633
very very difficult and should not go into wrong direction.

00:26:39.757 --> 00:26:44.715
For that, we have to do the Primordial Mother's Puja

00:26:44.924 --> 00:26:49.299
because we should try to be on the line of Primordial Mother.

00:26:49.466 --> 00:26:52.840
We have to keep ourselves Primordial.

00:26:53.341 --> 00:26:56.383
We have to work out our Primordial Self,

00:26:56.591 --> 00:27:01.174
and not to change ourselves for any rhyme or reason.

00:27:01.591 --> 00:27:04.840
This will be the best thing, if we can achieve it.

00:27:04.965 --> 00:27:08.216
I'm sure we can, not such a problem.

00:27:08.508 --> 00:27:15.383
Only thing is that we are so conscious of being Indians,

00:27:15.549 --> 00:27:20.549
being English,  being English, European and all that.

00:27:20.882 --> 00:27:22.757
But we are not.

00:27:22.965 --> 00:27:27.341
We are just ourselves and that's what we have to achieve

00:27:27.508 --> 00:27:33.132
- that Oneness with ourselves.
May God bless you all!
