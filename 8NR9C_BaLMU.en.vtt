00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:16.500
Today, we are going to worship Shri Krishna.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.630
See how cold it was about three o'clock.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:33.620
Now the reason is this, that Shri Krishna
did little mischief with Indra.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:43.579
Indra, who is a God, or you can call semi-God,
for looking after the rain.

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:49.060
So, Indra got very angry.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:01:01.469
You see all such semi-Gods are very sensitive
people, at the smallest thing they get angry

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:11.510
and irritated and they start using their powers
to express their anger.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:23.630
So he started pouring rain on all the gopas
and Shri Krishna, who were looking after the

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:31.340
cows.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:42.090
And the rain was so heavy that they thought
that the whole land will be completely submerged.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:02:13.660
So Indra was very happy to spoil the game
of Shri Krishna, and he thought he was very

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.590
successful.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:33.590
So, Shri Krishna lifted a mountain on His
finger, and all these people who were getting

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.070
drowned, went under that mountain.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:44.950
This is Shri Krishna's style.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.810
My style is different.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:56.380
I told Indra that you can't misbehave with
me, you can't.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:06.180
So far I'm not harmed you in any way and
I'm not irritated you.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:15.420
Of course it's going to be Shri Krishna's
Puja, but that doesn't mean that you should

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:21.600
try to show off your powers before me.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:29.800
Sometimes I wonder these Devas - Semi-Gods,
they are realized souls or not, because why

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:35.800
do they get angry like this for small things.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:46.640
Whatever it is, he could be reconciled and
now it's become warm, I must say.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:04:03.260
With Sahaja Yoga you can do many many things,
but you must know what you can do.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:17.060
For that, Krishna is a very good example.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.459
He started Sahaj culture.

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:31.710
Culture, I'm saying - He didn't give realization
to anyone, but He gave the idea of Sahaj culture.

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.800
How?

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:48.660
- Before him came Shri Ram, who was Maryada
Purushotama, who was a man very particular

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.740
about everything.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:05:01.580
I mean, like He threw out His wife because
He was a king and a king cannot have a scandal,

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.389
especially from His wife.

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:11.770
So He threw Her out - it was not Kali Yuga,
that's why.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:25.120
And His father ordered him to go, not only
His father so much as His stepmother, to go

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.779
in an exile into a forest.

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:38.110
So He agreed, after all He was Maryada Purushotama.

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:46.590
So whatever His father said, He agreed, whatever
His mother said, He agreed, and went into

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:52.810
the forest, stayed there fourteen years.

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.780
This is the obedience to the father.

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.059
There was no need, His father was not God.

00:06:02.059 --> 00:06:17.059
He was God, but in those days it was important
to make people, not only respect the parents

00:06:17.059 --> 00:06:25.449
but also to obey them, that was the time.

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:37.590
In His time there were many munis, and many
saints and many also hatha yogis.

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:50.319
And these, even before him, used to make people
practice very strict type of discipline and

00:06:50.319 --> 00:07:00.879
if they did not practice the discipline, they
had to do a lot of penance.

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:09.759
And, so many people who tried also, never
reached the goal, because of the strictness

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:26.050
and complete discipline about following the
path of spirituality.

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:30.110
Recently I was reading a book called "Peaceful
Warrior".

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:39.710
There they have described an American seeking
the truth, and the guru of that fellow really

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:48.389
really takes him to such a horrible severe
task - that my granddaughter said, I am very

00:07:48.389 --> 00:07:52.759
angry with such a Guru, she couldn't bear
it.

00:07:52.759 --> 00:08:01.150
So ultimately he finds that he is the existence.

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:07.400
So that was the practice followed after Shri
Rama.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:17.990
People would leave their wives, children,
go to Himalayas and sit there and practice

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:20.960
meditation.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:37.950
It was a very rigorously followed, or I should
say, a very moral society - so very moral.

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:49.600
But it was out of fear, the whole morality
came through fear, which is also repeated

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:50.600
in other religions.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:57.350
Now I would say that Islam today, has taken
that form, it is the fear.

00:08:57.350 --> 00:09:03.560
They are not doing it out of freedom.

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:12.080
Also Christians, same thing, and Hindus - I
don't know - halfway this side, and half way

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:18.550
that side.

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:24.810
Even among Sikhs there's terrible disciplining.

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:31.880
So much so that, as punishment you have to
clean the shoes of all the people.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:35.630
I don't know if it is to beat yourself with
shoes or another.

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:42.440
But quite a lot of punishment is there.

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:56.510
Then came Shri Krishna and He saw the situation
- that the way people are really now fasting.

00:09:56.510 --> 00:10:08.690
If you really go through the rituals of Hindu
religion, out of one week, you will be fasting

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:11.740
for six days at least.

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:20.500
One day you might eat some sort of a food,
then you'll have to visit all kinds of places.

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:30.510
Now, recently they had to go, as you know,
to Amarnath, and so many died there.

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:38.710
So now they said "we have got Nirvana, we
died while doing this, so we have got Nirvana".

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:45.640
This kind of a very funny idea was existing.

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:54.160
That we have Nirvana now, we have achieved
whatever we wanted and now we are dead, so

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:59.020
many are dead, so those who were not dead
were repenting why they were not dead - it

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:04.850
would have been much better, they would have
got their Nirvana.

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:16.170
So, even in this Kali Yuga these ideas are
prevalent.

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:25.070
Even in India, people have very severe types,
especially in south I have seen, they do all

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:35.480
kinds of nonsense for the atonement or maybe
for something they are asking.

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:41.350
All this nonsense was too much for Shri Krishna.

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:48.600
He couldn't understand that they are going
to destroy their lives with this kind of ritualistic

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:55.480
gruelling, then what will remain out of them
for Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.230
So He's the one who started Sahaj culture.

00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:13.780
He said "let us enjoy, we must have enjoyment,
Nirmala Anand - pure joy".

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:18.590
How do we have pure joy by?

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:29.470
- He had this rakhi bandhan by which, apart
from your wife, everybody is your sister or

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:30.470
mother.

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:33.570
I must say it is quite true about Indians.

00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:39.340
Not in the north so much because of Islamic
influence, but in the south it is so.

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:43.520
In Maharastra it is so.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:55.100
And then He started also this Holi, in which
you should play with colors, maybe to get

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:58.560
rid of the color barriers we have, maybe.

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:05.890
In America it is a very good idea to play
with colors and put some black on the whites

00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:13.090
and some whites on the black and they can
see for themselves how stupid it is to fight

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:20.990
in the name of color.

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:32.630
He used to play with children who were looking
after cows, just like a very ordinary person.

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:37.170
He never tried to show off His powers.

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:47.170
He never tried to stand out, never would dress
up in a very special way, never.

00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:52.990
Just like an out ordinary cowherd.

00:13:52.990 --> 00:14:00.380
And His relationship with His mother, Yeshoda
- she was not His mother - was also extremely

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:02.310
beautiful.

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:11.940
There are so many beautiful poems written
about His childhood.

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:19.520
That, He's the one who is in charge of the
whole universe.

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:29.810
As a little boy used to put His finger into
His mouth wondering - how can a Divine Virata

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:38.720
do that?

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.070
What is His thinking like a child?

00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:43.190
All His actions of children.

00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:47.010
Yesterday's song, as you heard it, is this.

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:51.470
All these little, little actions are described
very well.

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:56.040
Especially by another very great poet, Surdas,
who was blind.

00:14:56.040 --> 00:15:05.560
His childhood is described in a very beautiful
manner and the description of His relationship

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:12.430
with His mother is very natural and very sweet.

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:17.510
It was not like this, as modern times, a carpet
is spoiled, "Oh, the carpet you have spoiled

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:22.130
it, I'll hit you hard, this carpet you have
spoiled".

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:29.200
They have more interest in their things than
in their own children.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:37.000
But according to our culture, if the child
breaks anything, you have to say this "very

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.060
good you have broken, some badha has gone
away".

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:49.600
Never to scold a child for doing anything
which you think is destructive - because then

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:54.070
he will definitely become destructive.

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:59.310
So to understand a child, I think you must
read those poems, beautiful poems, which are

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:03.340
written about Shri Krishna.

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:14.410
I don't know how their imagination reached
that beautiful height of pure joy.

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:26.160
So towards our children also, we have to be
extremely sweet and nice and forgiving.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:33.590
But some children, of course, I meet are difficult,
but they also can be corrected if you really

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:36.990
apply Shri Krishna's methods to him.

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:49.690
Now when He went to college, or we can say
in to the school of a Sandipanimuni, the guru.

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:55.120
The guru's wife was very kind.

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:59.880
But the guru was strict.

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:10.220
And his wife used to look after him and when
she gave him something for food when they

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:17.380
would go and bring some woods from the forest.

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:22.590
It is very subtle, you know the whole thing
is.

00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:30.870
He went there and His friend was carrying
the food.

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:38.070
His friend was carrying the food and Shri
Krishna was busy cutting the wood, imagine?

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:45.660
Shri Krishna was cutting the wood for the
mother.

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:51.900
I mean, for the mother He could do anything,
He was God.

00:17:51.900 --> 00:18:01.940
So no work for the mother was menial or lower.

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:13.630
But the other fellow, the friend of His, he
was very hungry, so he ate all the food and

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:16.360
nothing was left.

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:21.680
So when he came down, he got very much worried.

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:29.710
He went and told his guru that "I ate all
the food and I didn't share it with Shri Krishna".

00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:40.580
The guru got very angry, very angry and he
said "now, you will be cursed with permanent

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:41.580
poverty".

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:53.750
But the mother said "no, not permanent - till
you meet Shri Krishna again".

00:18:53.750 --> 00:19:01.880
That's how she tried to give, we call it Upashad,
in that you give another curse, which can

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:05.870
neutralize partly.

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:15.640
The same friend, was Sudama, and he was very
very poor.

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:25.710
Now see the Sahaj ways of Shri Krishna, He
always used to remember Sudama and He told

00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:33.210
His wife that I really I don't know, he's
cursed, I don't know what must be his condition,

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:34.650
where he must be?

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:44.890
Now the friendship - He was a king, such intimacy
of feeling with a friend.

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:48.370
He said "I used to go with him, I used to
collect the woods.

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:54.250
I mean, imagine all these little, little things
had such a big importance for him.

00:19:54.250 --> 00:20:01.340
So, He was not only worried about the whole
world, as He should have been, but also about

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:04.640
Sudama - When will I meet him?

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.570
When will I see him again?

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:12.429
Where must be his house?

00:20:12.429 --> 00:20:13.950
How he must be living?

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:24.020
All these very delicate feelings He had for
His friend.

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:29.330
Just like a Sahaja Yogi.

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:39.740
In the Sahaja style, we worry about the whole
world and also individually we are worried.

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:51.570
We come to know about one person who has fallen
sick, who has a problem, something is serious.

00:20:51.570 --> 00:21:03.840
All the Sahaja Yogis think of him and are
worried about him, they may have everything,

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:09.840
but still they are worried, what is happening
to such and such person.

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:20.650
How many of us know each other's names - I
mean He knows everybody's name - practically.

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:33.550
And how we care for them, how we respect them,
how we love them and how we have pure relationships.

00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:42.580
Today is also the day of Rakshabandhan, which
is a very great thing that we should have

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:46.090
pure relationships.

00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:57.660
I've seen in, say Maharashtra, men won't go
and talk to women much and women won't go

00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:01.670
and talk to men.

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:11.590
And once, somebody remarked - "Then what are
you women doing, talking to women only?".

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:14.760
So, I said what are we to talk to you?

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:19.670
You are talking about your office, we are
talking about our houses and homes.

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:23.690
What is there to talk to you?

00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:29.710
The western culture is different, they will
force you.

00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:34.460
They'll make one man sit here and next to
him should be a woman, somebody else's wife,

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:37.480
then another man and then somebody else's
wife.

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:44.430
How can you have intimacy?

00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:55.470
This kind of idea, which is A-Sahaj, has slipped
into immorality.

00:22:55.470 --> 00:23:01.480
There's no need for men and women to sit like
that, what is the need, I just don't understand.

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:04.040
Compulsorily you have to sit.

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:15.840
I've had a bad time, I tell you, with my husband's
job, I never liked it.

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:20.670
What is there to talk to these men, after
all, I don't know anything about banking,

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:25.880
I don't know shares, I don't know stock exchange,
what it is.

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:31.750
Or I don't know profits, and this and that
- that part is zero.

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:39.860
Then, I don't know about office, I don't know
many other things men talk about, so what

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:45.809
is there to talk to them - it is so very difficult.

00:23:45.809 --> 00:23:53.120
And whenever I said something, I really dropped
a brick.

00:23:53.120 --> 00:24:02.100
Once in a party, they were offering drinks
to everyone and this, so I said "I will have

00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:06.300
a soft drink".

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:08.910
So the valet came and gave me a soft drink.

00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:18.010
The valet was having a bow, and a white shirt,
that's all, absolutely A-Sahaj methods.

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:27.880
Black bow, white shirt, black coat, black
pant, all just the same - whether it is an

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:30.640
ambassador or a valet.

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.610
You can't make it out who is who.

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:56.890
So I drank, you know, and when it was finished
I gave it to an ambassador, a very well known

00:24:56.890 --> 00:24:57.890
ambassador.

00:24:57.890 --> 00:25:03.080
To me there was no difference at all, when
they are just say walking the same way, talking

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:05.910
the same way.

00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:11.790
So A-Sahaj the whole thing is.

00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:20.220
They say they have so many Embassies, for
what I don't know and there what they have,

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:24.730
always drinks, parties - shake hands, shake
hands.

00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:29.730
Your hands will break, I tell you.

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:33.000
Most A-Sahaj method is to shake hands.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:39.120
Why not say Namaste, it is better, and you
know me.

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:42.840
Sometimes I used to get such heat.

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:47.510
Like yesterday you have shown that the ice
melted.

00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:51.370
The same thing used to happen to me.

00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:56.570
Mostly they were very hot people and I didn't
know what to do, I used to stand on one side

00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:58.710
just feeling shy.

00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:04.810
But this method of hand shaking is absolutely
A-Sahaj.

00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:15.250
And worse than that is French method, is to
kiss, and like it or not - you are kissed.

00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:17.450
Or to hug somebody.

00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:30.010
The first time I gave realization to one English
gentleman, he just lifted me up like that.

00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:43.630
I said " all right - it's just out of joy
he has done it, it's all right".

00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:50.070
But there is no openness, there's no openness
of heart.

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:56.040
You go to a party, you have to be dressed
up like this only, if you are not dressed

00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:59.320
up like that, then you are useless.

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:03.420
If you go for a death also.

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:08.110
Somebody died, a great friend, a nice man.

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:11.120
So I was told I had to wear a black sari.

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:16.370
Black blouse, everything black.

00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:21.620
I said, "I have no sari, black without border,
you know".

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:25.309
So they said "you don't go".

00:27:25.309 --> 00:27:28.770
I said "Very good idea".

00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:32.380
Because I don't know these A-Sahaj methods.

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:40.910
You are not supposed to cry or weep there,
no, you have to keep quiet.

00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:49.960
Then when you go there, the body is lying
there, and after a prayer is said, you are

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:52.340
supposed to drink champagne.

00:27:52.340 --> 00:28:02.780
I mean, imagine it, how can you, no feelings,
for that body which is lying there dead.

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:09.490
And everybody very happy, and if somebody
looked unhappy, they would ask "what's wrong,

00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:12.360
are you all right?".

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:15.750
No consciousness that we have lost a friend
here.

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:23.290
This is the A-Sahaj style when it comes to
grief.

00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:38.870
When it comes to joy it is A-Sahaj, when it
comes to grief it is A-Sahaj.

00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:50.370
We have to be Sahaj, in the sense that whatever
we do, we do it spontaneously.

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:52.720
Not with deliberations.

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:57.670
We have some very anglicized people in India
also.

00:28:57.670 --> 00:29:09.309
And the lady of the house died
and I went to see - and in India the body

00:29:09.309 --> 00:29:13.950
is taken down on the ground.

00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:20.870
So they were discussing what to do, what time
to start the funeral and all that.

00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:27.330
So one lady, who is a very well known person
in India, she said "you should not do it before

00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:29.100
twelve o'clock".

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:30.340
I said "why"?

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:32.570
She said, "Because I'll have to wear white".

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:34.280
"That's true".

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:40.560
"And I'll have to go to the bank to get my
diamonds to match with the white sari".

00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:45.790
I said "What is this?"

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:56.470
Such filth of materialism.

00:29:56.470 --> 00:30:07.309
It is going too far, we are going away from
our feelings, from our emotions, which are

00:30:07.309 --> 00:30:16.240
genuine, which are there all the time, you
don't have to think about them, they exist

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:19.340
all the time.

00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:24.600
But you think "Now, should I cry or not?

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:28.070
Should I laugh or not?

00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:32.100
It's so spontaneous.

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:37.400
If you have joy, you are spontaneous.

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:43.090
You express your joy spontaneously.

00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:54.040
Of course, not in an uncultured way, but in
a very cultured way.

00:30:54.040 --> 00:31:02.340
Now, what 's the meaning of the Sahaj culture
- this culture, is something that is, you

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:13.740
are groomed, you are brought up, in a very
natural manner, that you develop a culture.

00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:26.990
A small, like, a child like, simple innocent
behavior.

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:45.830
It is Shri Krishna's introduction of idea
of pure joy - Nirmala Anand, which came as

00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:56.860
a great relief to Indian people because they
were following Shri Ramachandra.

00:31:56.860 --> 00:32:01.620
But then abandonment started.

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:15.110
The problem is, if you make them strict, they
become like starched clothes I think, that

00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:20.600
you can't wear them.

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:25.980
Or if you allow them - no, no, you must enjoy,
you must enjoy, all right, you allow them,

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:30.320
do what you like.

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:36.429
If you allow them to do what you like, then
they start doing all kinds of things.

00:32:36.429 --> 00:32:44.090
In India, we had lots of horrible things,
which I dare not even tell you - in the name

00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:45.090
of enjoyment.

00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:55.400
But Shri Krishna Himself has been very much
misrepresented by stupid people like Vidyapati.

00:32:55.400 --> 00:33:03.049
He was a great poet and he used Krishna and
Radha as Romeo and Juliet.

00:33:03.049 --> 00:33:11.330
That's the greatest insult to the purity of
their relationship.

00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:17.309
You must have seen many pictures like that,
in Kangra Shaili, and this shaili, and that

00:33:17.309 --> 00:33:18.309
shaili.

00:33:18.309 --> 00:33:25.380
It's all nonsense.

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:40.740
They could not show the reality of their relationship,
but some sort of a very vulgar expression.

00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:49.330
Because I think these poets and these artists
at that time had some hidden suppressed feelings

00:33:49.330 --> 00:33:59.200
within themselves and they used Shri Krishna
for that.

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:04.940
All kinds of romanticism is attached.

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:10.320
Sometimes I feel that people have not understood
Shri Krishna.

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:16.200
But there's a nice story about Him.

00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:28.929
That once, His wives, He had many wives, that
is also another controversial point.

00:34:28.929 --> 00:34:39.030
He had many wives, because these were sixteen
thousand powers of Shri Krishna, who had taken

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:47.810
birth and were captured by one king and kept
in the prison.

00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:54.270
So He had to release them, they were released.

00:34:54.270 --> 00:35:01.930
Now how are they to live with Shri Krishna,
He was a young man - so He married all of

00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:03.990
them.

00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:08.060
That is the case of Mohammed Sahib also.

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:13.980
He married all sixteen of them, they were
his powers.

00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:22.710
For a young man to keep sixteen thousand women
like a harem, what people would have thought

00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:25.210
of Him.

00:35:25.210 --> 00:35:27.310
So He married all of them.

00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:38.550
And another point about His life is, that
once these all these ladies, and He had also

00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:39.700
five wives.

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:48.580
These five wives were the causal of the five
elements.

00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:55.770
So He had to go.

00:35:55.770 --> 00:36:04.000
Once, these ladies wanted to go to see one
great saint.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:10.560
And the river, which was there, was all completely
flooded.

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:17.480
So, they came to Shri Krishna and told Him
that "How are we to cross? - because this

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:20.600
is over flooded.

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:24.880
He said "That's very easy to cross that river.

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:32.420
This river is called as the Virgin River,
Nirmada, now they are having big fights over

00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:35.730
it in India nowadays, a big politics.

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:49.099
So you go and tell her that "Oh River, if
Shri Krishna is a complete celibate personality,

00:36:49.099 --> 00:37:02.230
perfect brahmachari, if that is the truth,
you go down".

00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:09.710
And the river went down - and they crossed
over.

00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:14.220
Then they went and worshipped the saint and
when they came back to the bank of the river

00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:19.359
it was again very much flooded.

00:37:19.359 --> 00:37:21.990
So they went to that saint and asked him "Now,
how are we to go back?".

00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:24.020
He said "How did you come?".

00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:31.859
They said "this is what Shri Krishna asked
us to tell the river".

00:37:31.859 --> 00:37:40.960
"Alright, you go and tell the river that this
saint has not eaten any food whatsoever, nothing",

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:49.830
while they saw him eating plates after plates,
if this is the truth, then you better recede.

00:37:49.830 --> 00:37:57.540
So, they went down and told the river, and
the river went down.

00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:04.060
They were amazed that this man ate such a
lot of things and this river has gone down

00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:07.160
thinking this is the truth.

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:16.720
That means -
what has been their character?.

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:18.690
They're abhogis.

00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:32.880
They're abhogis means, they do not get, indulge
into it, they eat, all right, but they don't

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:39.920
care, they don't have that feeling of eating,
and feeling of enjoying the food, and nothing

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:43.150
of the kind, they are just eating.

00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:54.480
And this gentleman with seventeen, I should
say sixteen thousand and five wives, is called

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:59.120
as Brahmachari, because they are not involved.

00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:06.850
They are in Sar state.

00:39:06.850 --> 00:39:14.900
With such a great immaculate personality like
Shri Krishna, the way they have created this

00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:18.180
nonsense of romanticism.

00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:32.990
For America, I think they have gone too far
with the freedom they have.

00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:43.450
As people with Shri Krishna's blessings became
free from all the rules, regulations and got

00:39:43.450 --> 00:39:44.480
abandoned.

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:54.330
But America has gone much worse and not only
that, but the films they are producing are

00:39:54.330 --> 00:40:04.470
very dangerous films and really damaging the
whole world.

00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:11.119
They don't know what sin they are committing,
for thousands and thousands of people in the

00:40:11.119 --> 00:40:23.450
world have taken to all kinds of very destructive
ugly ideas.

00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:32.240
Freud, all right, he's ousted - finished,
he's done already a great harm.

00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:44.619
But what about these films, they are now very
much impressing our Indian directors.

00:40:44.619 --> 00:40:50.210
I think all these directors are guiding Indians
to hell.

00:40:50.210 --> 00:40:55.609
The whole thing is so absurd and so dirty.

00:40:55.609 --> 00:40:59.810
For an Indian mind it is really inconceivable.

00:40:59.810 --> 00:41:12.339
Even, I have seen Americans can't bear it,
it has gone that bad.

00:41:12.339 --> 00:41:18.900
Then other things have started with this freedom
that we have.

00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:31.150
Imagine if Shri Krishna was here, He would
never have put any oil in His head, He would

00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:36.020
have never combed His hair, as He must have
His [indistinct].

00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:42.560
And He might have worn some mod dresses from
America.

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:47.599
Otherwise, you cannot exist.

00:41:47.599 --> 00:41:50.760
All the junk now has gone all over the world.

00:41:50.760 --> 00:42:04.480
Selling in Moscow, selling in all the developing
countries.

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:12.099
Only thing, when it was declared that they
have AIDS - people used to buy even second

00:42:12.099 --> 00:42:16.310
hand from the tourists - they threw away all
that.

00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:23.810
They are carrying AIDS all over and drugs
all over.

00:42:23.810 --> 00:42:29.050
It's a destructive force.

00:42:29.050 --> 00:42:41.150
It's a destructive force, which is very active
in this Kali Yuga and so we have to have many

00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:46.920
Sahaja Yogis to fight this destructive force.

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:57.440
And when they are destructive they are not
hypocritical, that's they think is a very

00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:58.440
great quality.

00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:03.990
But at least with hypocracy you can save some
people but when it's just an open thing everybody

00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:08.790
starts doing that.

00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:17.910
So when you think the time Shri Krishna lived
and the beautiful time they had, of such clean

00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:34.060
life and how He killed all these demons, is
something so beautiful, so energy giving.

00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:41.420
But how many demons there are nowadays in
this world - is it one? is it two?, is it

00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:42.420
ten?

00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:48.339
One is finished, another comes up like a mushroom
that is finished, third one comes up like

00:43:48.339 --> 00:43:50.130
a mushroom.

00:43:50.130 --> 00:44:01.270
And the most fertile land is America.

00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:07.480
So you all have to pay attention to this land
of Shri Krishna.

00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:17.220
Especially Shri Krishna should really start
using His Sudarshana Chakra, would be a good

00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:19.440
idea.

00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:20.440
The time has come.

00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:24.310
That's why I gave you the conch.

00:44:24.310 --> 00:44:30.150
To declare the time has come to clean this
America.

00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:32.190
That is the thing we have to do.

00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:42.070
Today when we worship Shri Krishna, you must
awaken within you yourself that consciousness,

00:44:42.070 --> 00:44:48.360
that now Shri Krishna is within all of you.

00:44:48.360 --> 00:45:00.470
And by your communication, because He's collective,
by your speech, by your songs, by all that

00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:12.440
you use to communicate with others, should
carry the message of peace, of love, of compassion,

00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:18.250
of truth and above all of Sahaja Yoga.

00:45:18.250 --> 00:45:21.960
MAY GOD BLESS YOU !!!
