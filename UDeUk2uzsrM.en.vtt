[INTERPRETER]

00:51:49.185 --> 00:51:59.365
Shri Mataji: We follow religions like
Christianity, Hinduism, other religions -

00:51:59.365 --> 00:52:05.620
so many are there - Sikhism but there
is no binding force on us.

Shri Mataji: The main point we have missed
in every religion, is very simple.

00:53:02.113 --> 00:53:10.683
[INTERPRETER]

00:53:10.850 --> 00:53:17.165
Shri Mataji: Every religion has said one thing
common that, "You must seek the Eternal

00:53:17.776 --> 00:53:26.496
and live with the transitory in moderation
and [UNCLEAR] limitations."

[INTERPRETER]

00:53:41.477 --> 00:53:46.767
Shri Mataji: Because transitory things
have a built-in capacity to destroy

00:53:46.767 --> 00:53:49.694
themselves that's why they are transitory.

00:53:49.767 --> 00:53:58.847
[INTERPRETER]

00:53:59.389 --> 00:54:04.149

in their own limitations.

[INTERPRETER]

00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:17.238
Shri Mataji: That is why when we go to the
extremes, running after transitory things

00:54:17.238 --> 00:54:21.214
then, they start destroying us also.

00:54:21.490 --> 00:54:27.160

to be in control of ourselves?

[INTERPRETER]

00:54:43.989 --> 00:54:49.889

we do not know ourselves.

00:54:55.746 --> 00:55:01.446

00:55:10.867 --> 00:55:16.969

something and the brain says, "It's wrong,"

[INTERPRETER]

00:55:24.544 --> 00:55:28.774

with the brain.

[INTERPRETER]

00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:36.347

[INTERPRETER]

00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:46.900

man has come, who is a fraud,

00:55:46.900 --> 00:55:53.218
who is a crook and he says, he's
very great and he's very good.

Shri Mataji: So now how will you find out?
[INTERPRETER]

00:56:12.868 --> 00:56:18.534
Shri Mataji: It is impossible to find out because
he may appear to be a very good gentleman.

[INTERPRETER]

00:56:24.995 --> 00:56:31.545
Shri Mataji: So, we have no means to find out,
what is good and what is bad - to discriminate.

[INTERPRETER]

00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:45.748

that we have to have now within ourselves.

[INTERPRETER]

00:56:51.924 --> 00:56:58.686
Shri Mataji: You are paying attention to Me but
if I say, pay attention to yourself - you cannot

00:56:59.179 --> 00:57:07.789
[INTERPRETER]

00:57:08.176 --> 00:57:13.376
Shri Mataji: because the One who can
do that, is the Spirit,

00:57:13.376 --> 00:57:18.770
within you is the Self, which resides
in your heart.

00:57:19.341 --> 00:57:28.131
[INTERPRETER]

00:57:28.422 --> 00:57:36.412

your attention, you know the Absolute
Truth about everything.

your breakthrough into that Subtle power,

00:57:50.947 --> 00:57:53.725
which is All-Pervading - the Divine Power.

00:57:54.308 --> 00:58:03.248

00:58:03.366 --> 00:58:10.906

we see fruits and we see Nature and life.

[INTERPRETER]

00:58:19.478 --> 00:58:25.288

living miracles?

[INTERPRETER]

00:58:38.169 --> 00:58:41.949

and understanding!

[INTERPRETER]

00:58:48.291 --> 00:58:55.141
Shri Mataji: This Power must be somewhere
[INTERPRETER]

00:58:55.388 --> 00:59:00.618
Shri Mataji: and Hume has said that, "This
is a Collective Consciousness," he said so.

00:59:00.618 --> 00:59:05.205
[INTERPRETER]

00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:11.360
Shri Mataji: But in simple words, it is
the All-Pervading Power of God's love.

00:59:11.519 --> 00:59:18.269
[INTERPRETER]

00:59:18.371 --> 00:59:24.471
Shri Mataji: It is a subtle Power everywhere
[INTERPRETER]

00:59:24.471 --> 00:59:28.266
Shri Mataji: and it vibrates.
[INTERPRETER]

00:59:29.100 --> 00:59:38.771
Shri Mataji: And once, somehow, you can
feel it, then it can work through you
and you can maneuver it

00:59:39.301 --> 00:59:50.351
[INTERPRETER]

00:59:50.351 --> 00:59:56.410

made us, as you see that inside ourselves.

00:59:57.100 --> 01:00:04.570
[INTERPRETER]

01:00:06.273 --> 01:00:13.263

but was never manifested before.

01:00:13.662 --> 01:00:20.862
[INTERPRETER]

01:00:21.982 --> 01:00:30.142

all the Western civilization has grown
like a tree outside

01:00:31.149 --> 01:00:39.249
[INTERPRETER]

01:00:39.249 --> 01:00:45.159

of the roots otherwise this tree will collapse.

[INTERPRETER]

01:00:53.416 --> 01:00:59.513

told you, is the knowledge of the roots that we are.

01:01:00.474 --> 01:01:07.054
[INTERPRETER]

01:01:07.805 --> 01:01:15.175
Shri Mataji: And we have to know, if we have to
keep our civilization nourished and prosperous

01:01:15.175 --> 01:01:22.607
[INTERPRETER]

01:01:22.607 --> 01:01:28.443
Shri Mataji: We have seen in the world
now, the crisis of ecology, human crisis,

01:01:28.443 --> 01:01:33.931
people fighting among themselves, so many
problems - problems after problems in
modern times

01:01:34.348 --> 01:01:43.498
[INTERPRETER]

01:01:43.498 --> 01:01:46.223
Shri Mataji: because human-being has
become a problem

01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:51.190
[INTERPRETER]

01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:55.274
Shri Mataji: and these problems are
created by man, not by God.

01:01:55.274 --> 01:01:59.664
[INTERPRETER]

01:01:59.664 --> 01:02:05.010

is a transformed personality.

[INTERPRETER]

01:02:14.029 --> 01:02:17.118

"You are to be born again,"

01:02:17.118 --> 01:02:22.117
[INTERPRETER]

01:02:22.117 --> 01:02:26.225
Shri Mataji: but that doesn't mean that we can
have a certificate saying, "We are born again."

01:02:26.225 --> 01:02:29.187
We cannot have a false certificate
- it has to become.

01:02:29.933 --> 01:02:34.663
[INTERPRETER]

01:02:34.663 --> 01:02:38.731

01:02:38.731 --> 01:02:42.927
Shri Mataji: It has to happen.
[INTERPRETER]

01:02:42.927 --> 01:02:48.964
Shri Mataji: If it does not happen within you,
if you do not become, then it is falsehood.

01:02:49.379 --> 01:02:56.519
[INTERPRETER]

01:02:56.519 --> 01:03:01.000
Shri Mataji: It is artificial, you put any
brand on you, is artificial.

[INTERPRETER]

01:03:05.906 --> 01:03:10.727
Shri Mataji: You call by anything, it is
artificial and then these people,

01:03:10.727 --> 01:03:14.184
artificial people, start fighting
among themselves.

01:03:14.576 --> 01:03:19.256

- they become, grow big like plastics,

01:03:30.851 --> 01:03:35.192
millions and millions and then they
start beating each other.

01:03:35.192 --> 01:03:40.087

for money and all these transitory things.

[INTERPRETER]

01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:03.613
Shri Mataji: So, there is no emancipation.
[INTERPRETER]

01:04:03.830 --> 01:04:07.600
Shri Mataji: Christ didn't say that, "You
put a label on your head," that

01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:14.243
"We are 'Born again'," but He said, "You have to
be born again," is the actualization, He meant.

01:04:14.348 --> 01:04:20.008
[INTERPRETER]

01:04:20.008 --> 01:04:25.192
[INTERPRETER]

01:04:25.192 --> 01:04:28.898
Shri Mataji: So, the time has come for
us to be honest about it.

01:04:28.898 --> 01:04:34.084
[INTERPRETER]

01:04:34.084 --> 01:04:40.755
Shri Mataji: You don't have to believe Me also
when I say that because that would be a blind faith

01:04:41.095 --> 01:04:47.055
[INTERPRETER]

01:04:47.055 --> 01:04:51.879
Shri Mataji: but as scientist you must
keep your mind open and this is like

01:04:51.879 --> 01:04:57.852
the hypothesis, I put before you.
[INTERPRETER]

01:04:57.852 --> 01:05:03.451
[INTERPRETER]

01:05:03.821 --> 01:05:10.273
Shri Mataji: Then, if it works, then in
honesty you must know that you have
become a Self-realized person.

01:05:10.831 --> 01:05:19.741
[INTERPRETER]

01:05:19.741 --> 01:05:24.859
Shri Mataji: As he has already told you,
that we have got a residual power within

01:05:24.859 --> 01:05:30.460
our triangular bone called as sacrum.
[INTERPRETER]

01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:34.795
[INTERPRETER]

01:05:34.795 --> 01:05:44.374
Shri Mataji: In many people you can see,
the throbbing of this power, when we
try to give them realization

01:05:45.037 --> 01:05:50.647
[INTERPRETER]

01:05:50.647 --> 01:05:56.532
[INTERPRETER]

01:05:56.673 --> 01:06:02.013
Shri Mataji: when there is obstruction,
in the lower centers, as shown there.

01:06:02.221 --> 01:06:07.341
[INTERPRETER]

01:06:08.699 --> 01:06:14.619
Shri Mataji: Medically we can say, that all
these centers are connected with our plexuses.

01:06:14.830 --> 01:06:23.920
[INTERPRETER]

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:28.747
Shri Mataji: So we have the first one,
is the actually connected with our

01:06:28.747 --> 01:06:37.166
pelvic plexus, which is for excretion.

01:06:44.889 --> 01:06:52.091
Shri Mataji: So it is clear now, that
when you get your Self-realization, this
center does not come into play.

01:06:52.444 --> 01:07:02.914
[INTERPRETER]

01:07:03.298 --> 01:07:08.561
Shri Mataji: So, one of the activity of
this center, is a sex activity.

01:07:09.063 --> 01:07:14.354
[INTERPRETER]

01:07:14.467 --> 01:07:20.627
Shri Mataji: So those people who say, that through
sex you can achieve God, they are all nonsensical.

01:07:20.728 --> 01:07:29.208
[INTERPRETER]

01:07:29.208 --> 01:07:32.968
Shri Mataji: Of course, the sex is
important and is also transitory

01:07:33.237 --> 01:07:38.877
[INTERPRETER]

01:07:38.877 --> 01:07:44.111
Shri Mataji: but we are not sex points, we
are human beings and we have to become
super human beings.

01:07:44.111 --> 01:07:52.693
[INTERPRETER]

01:07:53.047 --> 01:07:58.847
Shri Mataji: So, there is no prohibition on
sex or anything but what is important is,

01:07:58.847 --> 01:08:03.448
that our attention should be for
achieving the Eternal.

01:08:03.448 --> 01:08:08.404
[INTERPRETER]

01:08:08.404 --> 01:08:16.068
[INTERPRETER]

01:08:16.127 --> 01:08:20.787
Shri Mataji: In Sahaja yoga we have many
marriages. This time we had about 75 marriages

01:08:20.787 --> 01:08:26.360
and most of them are very successful and we get
very beautiful children out of these marriages.

01:08:26.811 --> 01:08:34.591
[INTERPRETER]

01:08:34.591 --> 01:08:42.169
[INTERPRETER]

01:08:42.477 --> 01:08:50.197
Shri Mataji: So what happens is that, this
Kundalini just like a primule in a seed

01:08:50.463 --> 01:08:57.723
sprouts with the living process.
[INTERPRETER]

01:08:57.723 --> 01:09:05.494
[INTERPRETER]

01:09:05.494 --> 01:09:10.020
Shri Mataji: As the seed germinates,
when we put it in the Mother Earth,

01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:17.756
this Kundalini also starts rising because
the Mother Earth has got capacity.

01:09:19.161 --> 01:09:26.031
[INTERPRETER]

01:09:26.031 --> 01:09:31.964
[INTERPRETER]

01:09:31.964 --> 01:09:36.314
Shri Mataji: So now, all these centers
are connected with different plexuses,

01:09:36.314 --> 01:09:42.175
I told you but also with three channels you
see - one on the left, one on the right,

01:09:42.175 --> 01:09:47.328
one in the center, are also connected
with our Autonomous Nervous System.

01:09:47.523 --> 01:09:53.693
[INTERPRETER]

01:09:53.696 --> 01:09:59.716
[INTERPRETER]

01:09:59.716 --> 01:10:03.812
Shri Mataji: So, it's quite a complicated
thing within yourself.

01:10:03.812 --> 01:10:08.553
[INTERPRETER]

01:10:08.553 --> 01:10:13.941
Shri Mataji: But when you come in this
hall and you want to put on the light,

01:10:13.941 --> 01:10:18.150
you have to just put the switch, one
switch and all the lights are there.

01:10:18.420 --> 01:10:25.630
[INTERPRETER]

01:10:25.630 --> 01:10:29.262
Shri Mataji: It's all built-in
[INTERPRETER]

01:10:29.262 --> 01:10:33.931
Shri Mataji: I don't have to tell you the
whole history of electricity and then the

01:10:33.931 --> 01:10:38.817
source of electricity - no, it just works.
[INTERPRETER]

01:10:38.817 --> 01:10:44.632
[INTERPRETER]

01:10:44.632 --> 01:10:50.265
Shri Mataji: So, in our evolutionary process, this is
all built-in within us, we don't have to do anything.

01:10:50.265 --> 01:10:58.107
[INTERPRETER]

01:10:58.149 --> 01:11:04.829
Shri Mataji: So Sahaja means, 'Saha' means
with, 'ja' means born with you, is the power

01:11:04.829 --> 01:11:14.223
[INTERPRETER]

01:11:14.319 --> 01:11:18.789
Shri Mataji: and yoga means, union
with the Divine force.

01:11:18.815 --> 01:11:23.185
[INTERPRETER]

01:11:23.185 --> 01:11:29.740
Shri Mataji: This method of Sahaja yoga,
enmasse, I discovered about 19 years back

01:11:30.731 --> 01:11:41.041
[INTERPRETER]

01:11:41.342 --> 01:11:44.962
Shri Mataji: and it has worked.
[INTERPRETER]

01:11:45.112 --> 01:11:51.662
Shri Mataji: You'll be happy to know,
that in Sorrento we had so many scientist,

01:11:51.662 --> 01:12:01.726
doctors, musicians, artists, educationalist, who
came down here to give a full proof that it works.

01:12:02.755 --> 01:12:12.855
[INTERPRETER]

01:12:12.855 --> 01:12:24.187
[INTERPRETER]

01:12:24.187 --> 01:12:30.261
Shri Mataji: And last time I had visited
Sorrento and I told Vido that this is a

01:12:30.261 --> 01:12:36.846
very good place because here it's very
Divine vibrations, people are nice here.

01:12:36.846 --> 01:12:43.097
[INTERPRETER]

01:12:43.097 --> 01:12:51.446
[INTERPRETER]

01:12:51.446 --> 01:12:54.279
Shri Mataji: They are not affected
by negative force much.

01:12:54.279 --> 01:13:02.881
[INTERPRETER]

01:13:02.881 --> 01:13:08.224
Shri Mataji: Now with Sahaja yoga what happens
to you, first of all, when the Kundalini rises,

01:13:08.224 --> 01:13:15.159
She nourishes all these subtle centers and by
nourishing them with, your diseases get cured.

01:13:15.661 --> 01:13:21.471
[INTERPRETER]

01:13:21.471 --> 01:13:29.203
[INTERPRETER]

01:13:29.203 --> 01:13:35.030
Shri Mataji: Now we have many cancer patients,
who have been cured with Sahaja yog.

01:13:35.030 --> 01:13:42.618
[INTERPRETER]

01:13:42.618 --> 01:13:47.636
Shri Mataji: Specially, blood cancer patients,
who are certified to die, are still existing

01:13:47.636 --> 01:13:53.252
after so many years, very nicely.
[INTERPRETER]

01:13:53.252 --> 01:13:57.502
[INTERPRETER]

01:13:57.768 --> 01:14:02.278
Shri Mataji: Many diseases like [UNCLEAR],
which are not curable - where the muscles

01:14:02.278 --> 01:14:09.253
start becoming decomposed and dilapidated.
[INTERPRETER]

01:14:10.312 --> 01:14:15.422
[INTERPRETER]

01:14:15.422 --> 01:14:19.362
Shri Mataji: Like Schizophrenia, mental
disorders, also we cured.

01:14:19.411 --> 01:14:23.591
[INTERPRETER]

01:14:23.591 --> 01:14:29.643
Shri Mataji: So many types of diseases have
been cured by Sahaja yoga but not by Me

01:14:29.643 --> 01:14:34.943
but by your own force that is residing
there, that cures you, is your own.

01:14:35.343 --> 01:14:41.383
[INTERPRETER]

01:14:41.383 --> 01:14:47.473
[INTERPRETER]

01:14:47.962 --> 01:14:52.172
Shri Mataji: So, the physical side is
solved, once for all.

01:14:52.172 --> 01:14:56.995
[INTERPRETER]

01:14:57.255 --> 01:15:01.275
Shri Mataji: Mentally, you become
very alert and dynamic.

01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:07.060
[INTERPRETER]

01:15:07.060 --> 01:15:11.147
Shri Mataji: You become very creative
[INTERPRETER]

01:15:11.147 --> 01:15:14.625
Shri Mataji: because your fourth
dimension is expressed.

01:15:14.625 --> 01:15:18.957
[INTERPRETER]

01:15:18.957 --> 01:15:24.760
Shri Mataji: We have some very world famous
musicians, artists, who have been blessed

01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:30.930
by Sahaja yoga and suddenly they prosper.
[INTERPRETER]

01:15:31.177 --> 01:15:40.770
[INTERPRETER]

01:15:41.340 --> 01:15:48.000
Shri Mataji: Now spiritually many people are
suffering, as well as they are suffering emotionally.

01:15:48.744 --> 01:15:55.244
[INTERPRETER]

01:15:55.672 --> 01:16:01.352
Shri Mataji: Emotionally they become
very wise and they can face problems

01:16:01.352 --> 01:16:06.070
without much difficulty because they
become like witness of a drama.

01:16:07.563 --> 01:16:14.303
[INTERPRETER]

01:16:14.303 --> 01:16:22.028
[INTERPRETER]

01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:28.000
Shri Mataji: For example, when you are in
the water, you are afraid of the waves

01:16:28.247 --> 01:16:32.717
but if you get into the boat, you
can enjoy the waves.

01:16:32.918 --> 01:16:37.698
[INTERPRETER]

01:16:37.710 --> 01:16:45.970
[INTERPRETER]

01:16:46.157 --> 01:16:53.087
Shri Mataji: So the state of your mind, reaches
that height where you becomes a witness

01:16:53.367 --> 01:17:04.567
of all this world and you stand on your
axis and the world moves like a wheel.

01:17:04.914 --> 01:17:11.744
[INTERPRETER]

01:17:11.744 --> 01:17:18.395
[INTERPRETER]

01:17:18.395 --> 01:17:21.236
Shri Mataji: Normally, we live in the
past or in the future

01:17:21.487 --> 01:17:25.617
[INTERPRETER]

01:17:25.849 --> 01:17:32.799
Shri Mataji: and the thought waves start
from this enter another one, another one
comes up - we are jumping on the cusp.

01:17:33.384 --> 01:17:41.864
[INTERPRETER]

01:17:41.969 --> 01:17:49.999
Shri Mataji: We are all the time thinking.
[INTERPRETER]

01:17:49.999 --> 01:17:55.950
Shri Mataji: but with Sahaja yoga, you enter
into the realm of present, between the thought.

01:17:56.044 --> 01:18:05.304
[INTERPRETER]

01:18:05.304 --> 01:18:11.659
Shri Mataji: That is the peace within ourselves.
[INTERPRETER]

01:18:11.659 --> 01:18:16.371
Shri Mataji: Then, if you want to think, you think,
if you don't want to think, you just don't think.

01:18:16.371 --> 01:18:25.736
[INTERPRETER]

01:18:25.736 --> 01:18:30.552
Shri Mataji: People start with 'Foundations
of Peace', 'Rock of Peace' and all that

01:18:30.552 --> 01:18:37.300
but they have no peace within themselves.
[INTERPRETER]

01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:43.726
[INTERPRETER]

01:18:43.726 --> 01:18:49.268
Shri Mataji: So, how can they give peace?
[INTERPRETER]

01:18:49.309 --> 01:18:55.239
Shri Mataji: This peace is within ourselves.
[INTERPRETER]

01:18:55.239 --> 01:19:01.979
Shri Mataji: We are really glorious things
[INTERPRETER]

01:19:01.979 --> 01:19:08.328
Shri Mataji: Human-beings are created
and they are at the epitome of creation;

01:19:08.709 --> 01:19:12.299
They are the highest thing that
God has created.

01:19:12.376 --> 01:19:20.400
[INTERPRETER]

01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:25.151
Shri Mataji: But in the darkness of
ignorance, people know each other

01:19:25.151 --> 01:19:31.320
[INTERPRETER]

01:19:31.689 --> 01:19:42.749
Shri Mataji: But then, once you get your
realization, in the light of enlightenment,

01:19:42.749 --> 01:19:52.123
you know everyone because you get in yourself
the new awareness of collective consciousness.

01:19:53.131 --> 01:19:59.441
[INTERPRETER]

01:19:59.859 --> 01:20:05.979
[INTERPRETER]

01:20:06.018 --> 01:20:13.058
Shri Mataji: You can feel it on your finger-tips, the
All-Pervading Power about which every religion
has talked.

01:20:13.244 --> 01:20:25.154
[INTERPRETER]

01:20:25.154 --> 01:20:28.174
Shri Mataji: It is the cool breeze
of the Holy Ghost

01:20:28.374 --> 01:20:32.275
[INTERPRETER]

01:20:32.455 --> 01:20:38.658
Shri Mataji: Then these five finger, six and
seven are denoting your centers within yourself.

01:20:39.055 --> 01:20:49.035
[INTERPRETER]

01:20:49.583 --> 01:20:55.753
Shri Mataji: And on the right hand side
you feel your physical and your intelligence

01:20:55.753 --> 01:21:00.392
or your activity and on the left hand
side, you feel the emotional.

01:21:00.995 --> 01:21:05.775
[INTERPRETER]

01:21:06.140 --> 01:21:17.050
[INTERPRETER]

01:21:17.101 --> 01:21:26.041
Shri Mataji: So, if you can just know what
is what, you can also know how to cure it

01:21:26.173 --> 01:21:29.933
and you can be alright yourself,
you can treat yourself.

01:21:29.991 --> 01:21:36.531
[INTERPRETER]

01:21:36.531 --> 01:21:42.493
[INTERPRETER]

01:21:42.493 --> 01:21:46.720
Shri Mataji: So sitting down here, you can
feel the vibrations of anyone you want to know,

01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:52.167
whether dead or alive and you can find
out what was his, what is his situation.

01:21:52.487 --> 01:21:58.417
[INTERPRETER]

01:21:58.417 --> 01:22:03.911
[INTERPRETER]

01:22:04.265 --> 01:22:12.005
Shri Mataji: Not only that, but you can
also raise the Kundalini of another person

01:22:12.142 --> 01:22:18.662
[INTERPRETER]

01:22:18.766 --> 01:22:24.386
Shri Mataji: and you have a right to do that.
[INTERPRETER]

01:22:24.386 --> 01:22:29.783
Shri Mataji: You can give realization to others,
[INTERPRETER]

01:22:29.783 --> 01:22:33.354
Shri Mataji: you can cure others
[INTERPRETER]

01:22:33.354 --> 01:22:38.355
Shri Mataji: but you become yourself a very
beautiful, righteous, loving personality.

01:22:38.380 --> 01:22:46.200
[INTERPRETER]

01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:53.701
Shri Mataji: And above all what you get, is joy.
[INTERPRETER]

01:22:53.701 --> 01:23:00.384
Shri Mataji: The joy is not like happiness
or unhappiness but is singular - joy.

01:23:01.061 --> 01:23:08.741
[INTERPRETER]

01:23:08.741 --> 01:23:13.643
Shri Mataji: So you just go on swimming
in the ocean of joy all the time

01:23:13.643 --> 01:23:21.473
[INTERPRETER]

01:23:21.473 --> 01:23:27.200
Shri Mataji: There is no time for being
harsh to anyone, no time for being crooked,

01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:35.062
no time for being harmful to anyone
[INTERPRETER]

01:23:35.062 --> 01:23:43.695
[INTERPRETER]

01:23:44.093 --> 01:23:50.033
Shri Mataji: and you are looked after
[INTERPRETER]

01:23:50.065 --> 01:23:54.405
Shri Mataji: as if, you have entered into
the Kingdom of God, which is very efficient

01:23:55.146 --> 01:24:01.386
[INTERPRETER]

01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:08.640
Shri Mataji: and then Virata uses His Being
through you - you are amazed how you are
helped all the time.

01:24:08.881 --> 01:24:20.411
[INTERPRETER]

01:24:20.432 --> 01:24:26.132
Shri Mataji: This is what you are. Only
you have to become aware of it.

01:24:26.488 --> 01:24:33.548
[INTERPRETER]

01:24:33.548 --> 01:24:39.043
Shri Mataji: Like I say, there's a television
and you take in an Indian village and

01:24:39.043 --> 01:24:44.127
tell them that, "You can see all kinds of
beautiful dramas in this." They won't believe.

01:24:44.127 --> 01:24:50.364
They'll think this is just a, some sort of a box.
[INTERPRETER]

01:24:50.364 --> 01:24:56.907
[INTERPRETER]

01:24:56.907 --> 01:24:59.442
Shri Mataji: We also think we are
some sort of a box

01:24:59.442 --> 01:25:07.684
[INTERPRETER]

01:25:07.684 --> 01:25:12.339
Shri Mataji: but once you put to the mains,
then you know what glorious thing you are!

01:25:12.414 --> 01:25:26.114
[INTERPRETER]

01:25:26.114 --> 01:25:30.611
Shri Mataji: Then you get meaning to your
life and you know why you are on this earth.

01:25:30.682 --> 01:25:37.042
[INTERPRETER]

01:25:37.042 --> 01:25:41.274
Shri Mataji: May God bless you all!
[INTERPRETER]

01:25:44.588 --> 01:25:48.378
Shri Mataji: Now, should we have
some questions from...?

01:25:48.378 --> 01:25:58.560
[INTERPRETER]

01:26:01.448 --> 01:26:04.458
SYogi: I think, they all want the
experience, Shri Mataji.

01:26:04.458 --> 01:26:06.485
Shri Mataji: Annh? (What?)
SYogi:I think, they all want the experience.

01:26:06.485 --> 01:26:09.562
Shri Mataji: Oh, alright! That's very
good. That is Sorrento!

SYogi(Presenter): He's asking, it may help
him that we stop thinking and how it happens?

01:26:36.765 --> 01:26:42.086
Shri Mataji: It happens because, when the
Kundalini rises, you see, this power passes

01:26:42.086 --> 01:26:47.895
through this area, which is the crossing
point of optic chiasma, so what happens,

01:26:47.895 --> 01:26:53.416
that your ego and superego are sucked
in, sucked in and because of that

01:26:53.416 --> 01:27:00.345
this opening, then there's no thought.

Shri Mataji: Now on this center, you'll
be surprised to know, that it is Christ.

01:27:23.014 --> 01:27:32.114
He resides there and that's what He has said that,
"I'm dying for your sins." So no more of your sins

01:27:32.114 --> 01:27:38.093
or your karmas are there anymore - finished. Once
He's awakened, He takes away all the problem.

Shri Mataji: and then you start feeling the cool
breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area.

01:28:04.976 --> 01:28:10.768
So, it's the actualization of your baptism - it's
not just somebody putting the hand or a water

01:28:10.768 --> 01:28:14.044
but you really feel the cool breeze
out of your own head.

like to know, now how this is possible?
How can this dynamic force rise within us?

01:29:24.557 --> 01:29:30.562
Shri Mataji: It's a living process, you see, just
like the seed rises, just like the seed comes up.

01:29:30.562 --> 01:29:34.551
But be careful with the people, who come
with the Spiritual talks. If they are

01:29:34.551 --> 01:29:37.761
interested in your money, then you have
nothing to do with them.

[INTERPRETER]

01:35:48.328 --> 01:35:58.058
Shri Mataji: Alright. First I will tell you,
how you yourself can raise your Kundalini.

01:35:58.058 --> 01:36:07.605
Very simple, very simple and then we'll
close our eyes and I'll try, that you all

01:36:07.605 --> 01:36:12.438
get your realization - alright? So he will
show you what is to be done, first of all.

01:36:12.438 --> 01:36:18.643
First of all, you'll have to put the left
hand towards Me because this represents

01:36:18.643 --> 01:36:23.130
the power of desire that you want
to have your realization.

[INTERPRETER]
Shri Mataji: Like this

01:36:56.728 --> 01:37:02.748
Shri Mataji: With the right hand, now, we'll do
the action of helping our centers to open out.

01:37:02.748 --> 01:37:07.124
So the right hand we'll put it first on
the heart - very important.

01:37:24.481 --> 01:37:27.714
Shri Mataji: You can open the button,
would be better, and put the hand

01:37:27.975 --> 01:37:31.695
because after all, I'm the Mother,
so there's no formality.

01:37:32.383 --> 01:37:38.823
[INTERPRETER]

01:37:39.054 --> 01:37:43.834
Shri Mataji: Now, then you have to take
your right hand in the upper - we work

01:37:43.834 --> 01:37:49.468
only on the left hand side - in the upper
part of the abdomen on the left hand side.

01:37:49.468 --> 01:37:54.363

01:38:00.070 --> 01:38:05.802
Shri Mataji: First in the heart, on the heart

01:38:06.142 --> 01:38:10.922
[INTERPRETER]

01:38:11.174 --> 01:38:17.334
Shri Mataji: But secondly, now we put it
on the center, which gives us the mastery.

01:38:18.184 --> 01:38:27.884
[INTERPRETER]

01:38:28.434 --> 01:38:35.024

Shri Mataji: Lao-tse - many. So now,
we put our - Socrates, Socrates.

01:39:00.968 --> 01:39:08.498
Then we put our right hand on the lower
part of our abdomen, on the left hand
side and press it hard.

01:39:08.498 --> 01:39:13.409
[INTERPRETER]

01:39:13.541 --> 01:39:20.161
Shri Mataji: This is the center through
which we work out all the Divine laws.

01:39:29.346 --> 01:39:32.982

01:39:38.185 --> 01:39:44.285
Shri Mataji: and while the Kundalini
is the Power of Pure Desire.

01:39:44.285 --> 01:39:49.117
[INTERPRETER]

01:39:49.131 --> 01:39:55.031
Shri Mataji: All other desires are impure
because whatever desires we fulfill,

01:39:55.031 --> 01:40:02.051
they are never satiable according to the
Economics. You tell them, they're not rightly so.

01:40:02.051 --> 01:40:06.868
[INTERPRETER]

01:40:06.868 --> 01:40:14.218
[INTERPRETER]

01:40:14.714 --> 01:40:20.524
Shri Mataji: Then what we do, is to put our
right hand, upper part of the abdomen again

01:40:20.671 --> 01:40:25.691
because Kundalini starts rising.
[INTERPRETER]

01:40:25.691 --> 01:40:29.534
[INTERPRETER]

01:40:29.534 --> 01:40:32.993
Shri Mataji: Then we take this right
hand again on the heart.

01:40:32.993 --> 01:40:35.673
[INTERPRETER]

01:40:38.255 --> 01:40:47.695
Shri Mataji: Now we take this hand in the
corner of your neck and your shoulder,
here and put it down.

01:40:47.695 --> 01:40:54.934
[INTERPRETER]

01:40:54.934 --> 01:40:57.849
Shri Mataji: Take it from the front,
not from the back side.

[INTERPRETER]

01:41:01.656 --> 01:41:06.997
Shri Mataji: and then turn our head to the right
[INTERPRETER]

01:41:07.556 --> 01:41:13.746
Shri Mataji: This center is the one, which
is caught within us, which is obstructing us

01:41:13.820 --> 01:41:19.900
because we feel very guilty.

[INTERPRETER]

01:41:23.526 --> 01:41:28.013
Shri Mataji: At the very outset, I have to
tell you, that God cannot commit mistakes

01:41:28.013 --> 01:41:32.331
but we are human-beings and human-beings
must commit mistakes after all.

01:41:32.690 --> 01:41:37.600
[INTERPRETER]

01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:42.430

01:41:42.430 --> 01:41:47.282
Shri Mataji: What is there to feel so guilty?
[INTERPRETER]

01:41:47.330 --> 01:41:50.500
Shri Mataji: There's nothing to feel
guilty about anything.

01:41:50.500 --> 01:41:54.337
[INTERPRETER]

01:41:54.337 --> 01:41:58.395
Shri Mataji: So please, for very outset, I
must say, you should not feel guilty but

01:41:58.395 --> 01:42:02.919
you feel happy and know that you are
going to get to your glory.

01:42:13.102 --> 01:42:19.222
Shri Mataji: Now, you have to raise your
right hand and put it on your forehead

01:42:19.222 --> 01:42:23.833
across, with your left hand towards Me,
like this and press it on both the sides.

01:42:23.833 --> 01:42:30.354
This is the center, as I told you, of Christ,
which is for forgiveness, forgiving everyone.

01:42:30.668 --> 01:42:35.628
[INTERPRETER]

01:42:35.628 --> 01:42:41.737

[INTERPRETER]

01:42:49.097 --> 01:42:54.947
Shri Mataji: Now you have to take back
your hand on the back side of your center.

01:42:54.947 --> 01:43:00.533
This is the another part of the same
center and put your head on top of that

01:43:00.533 --> 01:43:06.840
resting on it and look, close your
eyes and look upward.

01:43:07.380 --> 01:43:13.550

01:43:18.214 --> 01:43:21.691

you have to ask for forgiveness.

[INTERPRETER]

01:43:35.914 --> 01:43:42.619
Shri Mataji: and the center of your hand
must be put on the soft bone, here,

01:43:42.619 --> 01:43:48.316
which was in your childhood called fontanel
bone, press it hard, push back your fingers

01:43:48.709 --> 01:43:58.209
and move it slowly, seven times, clockwise.
[INTERPRETER]

01:43:58.209 --> 01:44:05.147

[INTERPRETER]

01:44:43.730 --> 01:44:47.582
Shri Mataji: That's all we have to do.
Again we close our eyes now

our eyes, till I tell you

[INTERPRETER]

01:45:03.868 --> 01:45:12.289
Shri Mataji: because attention has to go inside.
[INTERPRETER]

01:45:13.979 --> 01:45:19.609
Shri Mataji: Everyone should do
it to help each other.

01:45:19.609 --> 01:45:21.650
[INTERPRETER]

01:45:21.655 --> 01:45:28.195
Shri Mataji: Now please put your left hand
towards Me throughout, meaning you want
your Self-realization.

01:45:28.710 --> 01:45:34.270
[INTERPRETER]

01:45:34.270 --> 01:45:41.899
Shri Mataji: Both legs parallel to each
other on the Mother Earth or if you're
sitting, is alright. Take out your shoes.

01:45:42.124 --> 01:45:49.164
[INTERPRETER]

01:45:49.907 --> 01:45:58.677
Shri Mataji: Now, after that, also take out
your spectacles, if possible, because this
helps your eye-sight.

01:45:59.419 --> 01:46:06.149
[INTERPRETER]

01:46:06.149 --> 01:46:12.429
