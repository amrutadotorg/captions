05:37.920 --> 05:42.200
I’m just watching all the beauty.

05:46.880 --> 05:50.000
You looked so beautiful at the airport.

05:50.200 --> 05:59.680
Such a joy for me to see you in that shape.

06:01.080 --> 06:03.360
It’s a

06:09.200 --> 06:16.640
rare occasion sometimes

06:17.480 --> 06:28.760
that you feel oneness with the whole universe,

06:30.040 --> 06:35.040
absolutely oneness with the whole universe,

06:35.240 --> 06:44.160
when you feel the love that exists between all of you.

06:44.360 --> 06:47.680
It’s the love between you,

06:49.280 --> 06:51.960
oneness between you,

06:52.160 --> 06:57.880
the way you all have opened your heart to each other

06:58.960 --> 07:05.600
as good human beings, as realized souls, as saints -

07:05.800 --> 07:20.760
it’s the most fulfilling and satisfying thing for Me.

07:22.760 --> 07:31.960
When a saint used to meet another saint, say in India, what would happen?

07:32.800 --> 07:40.640
There was a saint in Maharashtra who was a tailor, but he was a saint.

07:40.840 --> 07:45.640
Saint is a saint whether he’s a tailor or he could be anything.

07:45.840 --> 07:51.160
And there was another saint who was a potter,

07:51.360 --> 08:00.000
who used to make pots, and things like that, out of clay.

08:01.680 --> 08:14.320
So this saint, Namadeva, went to see this potter

08:15.840 --> 08:20.760
who was making some pots out of clay.

08:24.840 --> 08:27.880
And he looked at him.

08:30.000 --> 08:34.440
And the feeling that came into his heart is expressed -

08:34.640 --> 08:40.960
he was a great poet also, Namadeva - so he says,

08:42.640 --> 08:50.000
in Marathi it is, but I’ll translate it in English - “I came here

08:52.160 --> 08:57.920
to see the Chaitanya, the formless,

08:58.480 --> 09:03.200
but the formless is standing before me in the form”.

09:03.920 --> 09:07.200
So to appreciate

09:09.120 --> 09:15.480
the other saint he said, “Now the whole Chaitanya, the whole

09:17.840 --> 09:22.360
all-pervading power of God’s love has come in your form before me.

09:22.560 --> 09:24.880
I see it”.

09:26.640 --> 09:29.840
How to address, just think of it.

09:30.040 --> 09:34.200
At that moment, spontaneously he said this.

09:36.040 --> 09:42.920
That is how you are all saints, and saints have to see that,

09:43.440 --> 09:50.480
that you are the form of that love of God’s all pervading power.

09:50.680 --> 09:55.000
You are in the form of that, all of you.

09:55.480 --> 10:00.520
I think that day, you were standing in the rain and sleet

10:00.720 --> 10:04.200
with all your children. For a Mother it’s too much

10:04.400 --> 10:09.520
to see, such beautiful feelings for me.

10:09.720 --> 10:13.440
But the feelings among yourselves,

10:14.760 --> 10:19.600
the open-heartedness, the Pure love,

10:20.560 --> 10:25.040
that filled the whole atmosphere with such beauty.

10:25.720 --> 10:28.640
It’s not just talking,

10:30.400 --> 10:36.920
it’s not just writing letters or sending Birthday cards or something like that;

10:37.160 --> 10:39.920
it’s from the heart,

10:41.200 --> 10:46.000
you have to feel each other that you are all saints.

10:46.800 --> 10:52.840
You are different people, you have to support each other,

10:53.520 --> 10:56.800
you have to look after each other, you have to understand each other

10:57.000 --> 11:01.760
because you are the people of a different awareness

11:01.960 --> 11:06.720
living among people who are blind, who can hit you,

11:06.920 --> 11:11.840
they can do some harm to you.

11:17.360 --> 11:21.160
The other day I was reading Gyaneshwara; can you imagine,

11:21.360 --> 11:25.120
he died at the age of 23 years,

11:26.480 --> 11:29.920
at such an young age as 23 years.

11:30.120 --> 11:36.160
And the Gyaneshwari he wrote was at the age of 21 years. And what a genius!

11:36.360 --> 11:42.200
I mean, you read it, you just don’t understand,

11:42.400 --> 11:49.680
how could he penetrate so deep. He described you all,

11:51.920 --> 11:56.040
as I have told you many-a-times he has described you

11:56.240 --> 12:09.840
as the oceans of, the walking oceans of Ambrose - Ambrosia.

12:12.680 --> 12:22.240
Talking trees, and the forest of

12:27.440 --> 12:35.680
the trees of bliss and beauty.

12:35.920 --> 12:38.320
That wherever you’ll go you’ll bless people.

12:38.520 --> 12:43.000
Wherever you will stand you’ll be auspicious,

12:43.200 --> 12:47.760
you will create harmony, peace and joy.

12:47.960 --> 12:53.960
That’s your work, that’s your style, that’s what you are here for.

12:55.360 --> 12:59.240
But beware, you ought to be very careful,

12:59.440 --> 13:03.440
because the surroundings seem to be quite deceptive

13:03.640 --> 13:06.520
and quite troublesome.

13:07.000 --> 13:15.440
And from that surrounding you are coming out suddenly into a new surrounding

13:15.640 --> 13:22.040
where you have known what is Divine love, what is Divinity.

13:23.240 --> 13:29.600
One has to be very careful because the forces that are negative

13:29.800 --> 13:38.280
are very strong, and working at you all the time,

13:38.480 --> 13:45.640
because you’ve come from matter, you have evolved from matter

13:46.680 --> 13:58.640
and it’s easy to go to matter, to materialism, to the materialistic ideas;

14:02.800 --> 14:07.960
and this materialism takes you to primitiveness.

14:08.720 --> 14:11.320
All your culture, all your beauty will drop out

14:11.520 --> 14:18.360
as soon as you take to materialism. If everything becomes money

14:18.920 --> 14:24.520
there’s no place for God, no place for love,

14:26.120 --> 14:32.200
no place for beauty or for any graciousness.

14:35.160 --> 14:39.920
Money is for us, we are not for the money.

14:40.120 --> 14:43.280
Money should be at our command.

14:44.480 --> 14:49.800
We don’t have to give up anything for that.

14:53.600 --> 15:00.160
And here then we see the materialism coming up in a very different way,

15:00.360 --> 15:05.400
very subtle ways, and we do not see it.

15:05.600 --> 15:10.040
When we start saying “my, mine, this is mine”

15:11.760 --> 15:16.880
then you are slowly drifting towards materialism.

15:19.240 --> 15:22.880
When you see yourself in the collective,

15:25.040 --> 15:31.360
that’s the only way you can get out of materialism.

15:31.640 --> 15:35.000
Because you are in reality a collective being.

15:35.200 --> 15:39.480
You are not an individual that way.

15:39.800 --> 15:43.800
But the matter divides you from each other.

15:45.920 --> 15:48.360
And when you realize

15:48.560 --> 15:53.280
that we are not slaves of matter, matter is our slave,

15:54.040 --> 15:58.480
we are not going to be dominated by any matter,

16:00.320 --> 16:04.160
then you can feel that love.

16:06.400 --> 16:10.040
One goes to absurd limits if you take to materialism;

16:10.240 --> 16:15.440
and everything can be explained in the name of materialism.

16:17.320 --> 16:22.880
But in the name of Divine how far can you go and explain?

16:24.040 --> 16:25.920
You have to just enjoy it.

16:26.160 --> 16:31.440
When you enjoy you don’t want to explain or talk about it, you just want to enjoy.

16:32.600 --> 16:35.640
Divinity is to be enjoyed within and without.

16:35.840 --> 16:41.400
It’s within you, divinity is within you, but is to be enjoyed.

16:42.520 --> 16:45.040
That’s only possible if you understand

16:45.240 --> 16:49.680
that you are not going to be dominated by any matter whatsoever.

16:51.520 --> 16:54.840
I’m sorry I’m here for such a short time,

16:55.040 --> 17:00.360
I wish I could be with you forever, which I am, I think.

17:02.120 --> 17:05.360
But you have brothers and sisters everywhere,

17:05.560 --> 17:13.160
the whole world has this message with them.

17:13.360 --> 17:16.240
You, some of you have met them in India.

17:16.440 --> 17:21.080
All the Indians have sent their love to you, lots of love,

17:21.280 --> 17:24.800
and they didn’t know what to send you from there, something special;

17:25.000 --> 17:28.320
so they sent Me.

17:39.960 --> 17:44.280
Sometimes I feel all of us should meet somewhere; all of us

17:44.480 --> 17:48.720
from all over the world, from every corner of the world, all the great saints

17:48.920 --> 17:53.880
who are in these modern times should meet each other, talk to each other,

17:54.080 --> 18:02.040
enjoy each other and understand each other.

18:03.840 --> 18:10.560
That’s the time we’ll think that a new era has started

18:10.760 --> 18:18.680
of love, of trust, of enjoyment of other human beings.

18:18.880 --> 18:21.640
When you start enjoying another person

18:21.840 --> 18:26.280
then only we can say that you are in the collective.

18:26.720 --> 18:32.560
Like My finger, if it pains the another one tries to soothe it,

18:32.760 --> 18:36.600
and I feel the soothing, without feeling any gratitude

18:36.800 --> 18:41.800
or without feeling any sort of a obligation.

18:43.520 --> 18:49.680
So always I say about collectivity. Those who cannot be collective,

18:49.880 --> 18:54.440
those who cannot open their hearts, those who keep aloof,

18:54.640 --> 18:58.680
those who think they are - some of them might be thinking “We are great Sahaja Yogis

18:58.880 --> 19:02.040
because we are very old Sahaja Yogis,” some might be thinking

19:02.240 --> 19:07.280
“we are very intelligent”, some that “we are rich, and poor” and all that,

19:07.480 --> 19:13.800
all these differences should disappear. Who is crying?

19:20.480 --> 19:23.880
She’s crying? What’s the matter?

19:24.080 --> 19:28.960
(Yogini speaks: “Clapping made him jump”. Yogi: “The clapping made him jump, Mother”.

19:29.160 --> 19:32.200
Shri Mataji: “And loudly?” Yogi: “The clapping made the baby jump, Shri Mataji”.

19:32.400 --> 19:35.440
Oh!

19:45.120 --> 19:50.280
One day they’ll all grow up. I was thinking when they’ll grow up

19:50.480 --> 19:55.000
they’ll clap much more than you will do!

19:57.280 --> 20:01.000
Little more time we need, somehow.

20:01.200 --> 20:06.000
All these great people will be becoming great Sahaja Yogis

20:06.200 --> 20:13.960
and will give us such a pleasure, such a joy, such a happiness.

20:15.200 --> 20:20.080
Today I wanted to speak about something,

20:20.640 --> 20:23.080
but I’ll just put it as a question to you all.

20:23.280 --> 20:26.960
And I would like to have an answer from you.

20:27.160 --> 20:31.560
You can write to Me and let’s see, or you can discuss.

20:31.760 --> 20:43.320
That as formerly, as other saints have said,

20:43.920 --> 20:49.000
that once you get your realization you are lost,

20:50.120 --> 20:55.520
you can’t speak about it. You can just tell them by some similes, metaphors,

20:55.760 --> 21:05.680
this, that, but you cannot really give them the experience by telling them.

21:06.880 --> 21:10.600
And that’s why many saints decided that after realization

21:10.800 --> 21:15.040
it’s better to disappear. Even Gyaneshwara took his samadhi,

21:15.240 --> 21:20.200
he went into a room and he died in that room.

21:20.920 --> 21:26.280
Because they could not say much about it, they could not tell much about it.

21:26.480 --> 21:29.640
But today that’s not the situation.

21:30.000 --> 21:35.040
Like Kabira has said that,

21:35.240 --> 21:40.160
“When a drop becomes the ocean, what can you say?”.

21:40.360 --> 21:45.200
You are lost, you are no more there, you are all finished.

21:45.400 --> 21:49.000
So what has happened in Sahaja Yoga, today’s Sahaja Yoga,

21:49.200 --> 21:53.800
that we are all talking about it, experiencing it and enjoying it?

21:54.000 --> 21:58.440
That’s the question for all of the Sahaja Yogis to solve.

22:05.720 --> 22:09.040
(Smiles and talks to somebody. Name not clear, sounds like “Elliot”.)

22:09.240 --> 22:11.800
You can explain?

22:13.840 --> 22:16.760
Did you hear My question?

22:16.960 --> 22:21.080
No? You didn’t hear My question

22:22.560 --> 22:26.200
You see, what I said was that formerly

22:26.400 --> 22:31.040
those people who got realisation got lost, alright?

22:31.280 --> 22:36.200
As you were lost just now into thoughtless awareness!

22:38.240 --> 22:45.040
But you can come back and you can tell people, you can talk about it,

22:45.280 --> 22:49.160
and many people disappeared.

22:49.640 --> 22:54.360
Actually, they didn’t want to live after getting realization for a long time,

22:54.600 --> 23:00.120
because they could not explain, talk to people about it.

23:00.320 --> 23:05.360
Also they said that, "How can a person who has no tongue

23:05.560 --> 23:11.720
tell about the taste of the jiggery?", it’s a kind of sweet.

23:11.920 --> 23:17.760
So there was a problem with them, all of them had a problem.

23:17.960 --> 23:20.280
But now you don’t have that problem.

23:20.480 --> 23:25.240
So what has happened in Sahaja Yoga that you have no problem?

23:26.360 --> 23:30.120
So think it over and write to Me, alright?

23:34.760 --> 23:39.720
So I don’t know what to say anymore.

23:42.280 --> 23:44.840
Just we are enjoying our rapport with each other, isn’t it?

23:45.040 --> 23:49.280
That’s all, sitting down here. Anybody has any questions?

23:49.480 --> 23:55.000
Anybody who is a new person can ask a question, would be good idea.

24:00.760 --> 24:04.640
Because these people have no questions now.

24:10.040 --> 24:12.560
Ask Me a question.

24:18.880 --> 24:22.800
(To somebody) I’ve heard the good news. Ah!

24:23.000 --> 24:26.400
Yogi: Shri Mataji, how should we approach the spreading of Sahaja Yoga?

24:26.600 --> 24:28.520
Shri Mataji: How can we…? Yogi: How should we approach

24:28.720 --> 24:31.240
the spreading of Sahaja Yoga to new people?

24:31.440 --> 24:34.200
Shri Mataji: What? Another yogi: He said how should we approach

24:34.400 --> 24:38.760
the spreading of Sahaja Yoga to new people, to the new people.

24:38.960 --> 24:41.200
How should we express Sahaja Yoga, Shri Mataji?

24:41.400 --> 24:48.400
Shri Mataji: To them? Now, you see, you’ll meet three types of new people.

24:48.760 --> 24:51.720
Firstly, those who are yogis,

24:51.920 --> 24:56.320
or you can call them as people of previous births,

24:56.520 --> 25:00.920
who are already very knowledgeable and are there,

25:01.120 --> 25:04.160
just they can feel it, this is it;

25:04.360 --> 25:09.000
you won’t have much problem with them, they’ll know it is so.

25:11.520 --> 25:18.400
To them it’s very obvious, and you’ll be amazed the way they are there,

25:19.440 --> 25:23.120
how they have taken to it so easily.

25:24.600 --> 25:32.720
Now the second type are the people who may be still believing, non believing,

25:32.920 --> 25:38.320
maybe some who are doubting, maybe;

25:38.520 --> 25:45.440
or maybe some who are asking questions about it, quite a lot.

25:46.760 --> 25:52.360
So is not sufficient only for you to get your realization,

25:52.960 --> 25:58.080
also not sufficient for you that you feel the vibrations

25:58.280 --> 26:04.240
and that you can give realizations to others, that won’t help much.

26:05.560 --> 26:13.640
You have to know how to deal with various types of people.

26:13.840 --> 26:22.880
Like I would say a person who is a, say, a priest,

26:24.440 --> 26:28.960
who comes to you and wants to talk to you about God, this, that and all that.

26:29.160 --> 26:32.640
So you must know Bible very well,

26:32.840 --> 26:37.080
and know Bible in the way a Sahaja Yogi should know.

26:37.280 --> 26:39.840
The other day Rustom telephoned to tell Me that -

26:40.080 --> 26:47.840
I told him to study Koran because, I said, Islam means surrender,

26:48.040 --> 26:52.080
but before realisation surrender has no meaning.

26:52.280 --> 26:54.320
And he’s told Me that it’s written in Koran

26:54.520 --> 26:57.480
that unless and until you are connected with God

26:57.680 --> 27:03.240
you cannot understand anything what is written here. It’s clearly said.

27:03.440 --> 27:05.840
Now when the Muslims talk to you, you can tell them:

27:06.040 --> 27:10.240
“This is written in Koran, are you connected with God?”.

27:11.120 --> 27:14.840
Now, they might say, “Are you connected?”.

27:16.920 --> 27:20.880
Now, then if you say, “Yes”, then finished!

27:21.720 --> 27:27.640
Then Mr. Ego will come up, you see, suddenly, and you be careful!

27:28.920 --> 27:34.120
So this subject should be treated with a barge pole.

27:34.320 --> 27:42.800
Like, such a question if they ask… you see they will be like that, “Are you that?”.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.160
Like in the beginning they used to ask Me, “What’s your Father?

27:45.360 --> 27:49.080
What’s your Mother? Who are you?". This, that, all those things, you see.

27:49.280 --> 27:53.600
So at that time you have to give an answer to them -

27:55.480 --> 28:00.400
Can you give this lady a chair to sit down? (Hindi) Sit down.

28:03.120 --> 28:07.680
No… Alright. (Hindi) Sit down... Sit down.

28:15.440 --> 28:22.240
So such a question if you answer in that manner

28:22.440 --> 28:26.880
you have not been clever enough; you have to be very clever.

28:28.960 --> 28:36.480
Then you should say, "You see, there are" - avoid the subject, don’t answer;

28:36.680 --> 28:44.200
you just say, “See, there are descriptions about a person who is a realised soul”.

28:45.440 --> 28:50.720
Jung has said that you have to become collectively conscious.

28:51.840 --> 28:53.760
Now, what is collectively conscious?

28:53.960 --> 29:00.720
That is, on your central nervous system you should be able to feel another person.

29:03.640 --> 29:08.480
Now Jung has said so, it’s a poet.

29:08.680 --> 29:12.600
Then you have got other people to quote:

29:13.040 --> 29:16.160
William Blake you can quote,

29:16.360 --> 29:21.440
you can quote other poets or saints whom you know,

29:21.920 --> 29:25.560
it depends on what sort of a person you are dealing with.

29:25.760 --> 29:29.000
But just don’t say, ”Yes, I am a realised soul”.

29:29.200 --> 29:34.400
People have been crucified, murdered, poisoned for saying that.

29:34.920 --> 29:39.600
So be careful, put it on somebody else and say,

29:39.800 --> 29:45.440
“Yes, the signs of a realised soul’s are like this,

29:45.960 --> 29:48.840
that he has to be collectively conscious”.

29:49.040 --> 29:51.000
First of all that you have read Jung

29:51.200 --> 29:54.440
or you know so much about collective consciousness itself

29:54.640 --> 29:59.440
will put them right in their own places, to begin with.

29:59.640 --> 30:03.000
Because you have to be knowledgeable in these modern times,

30:03.200 --> 30:06.560
and you should be able to communicate.

30:07.640 --> 30:10.160
Just by telling them, “I’m a realized soul,

30:10.360 --> 30:14.920
I have to awaken your Kundalini”, nobody is going to believe you.

30:15.360 --> 30:21.280
Even in India people don’t believe that we can give realisation -

30:21.480 --> 30:25.520
although they know about realisation, they know about Kundalini, they know everything,

30:25.720 --> 30:30.040
but still they cannot believe that we, like ordinary people,

30:30.240 --> 30:33.280
can give realisation to them.

30:34.520 --> 30:39.120
So in no way you should be diffident, but try to bring them round

30:39.320 --> 30:43.040
through somebody else, because the human nature is such,

30:43.240 --> 30:48.200
the one who is living, the one who is existing, they don’t want to accept.

30:48.400 --> 30:53.680
Whosoever is dead, you see, and written somewhere, anything, in black and white,

30:53.880 --> 30:58.640
and if you say in this book this is this written, they’ll accept.

30:58.960 --> 31:02.120
That’s why you have to be knowledgeable, you must read books

31:02.320 --> 31:08.760
which are supportive of your realisation, supportive of Sahaja Yoga.

31:09.120 --> 31:13.600
Then only you can talk to them. If you are just having realisation,

31:13.800 --> 31:17.600
you can give realisation, you have got vibrations, that won’t work out -

31:17.800 --> 31:25.480
especially in the Western countries where people are too much here, nothing there.

31:26.320 --> 31:30.320
You have to tell them that we are also intelligent enough,

31:30.520 --> 31:37.880
and we also understand it with our brains and logic, what is the truth is.

31:38.080 --> 31:44.960
Then after their realisation, of course, it’s much easier,

31:45.160 --> 31:51.120
but if you say, "Alright, come along, I have to give you realisation” - you cannot.

31:51.960 --> 31:55.360
You cannot force them, you cannot - they have to ask for it,

31:55.560 --> 31:58.160
after all there is a protocol of the Divine also,

31:58.360 --> 32:00.520
the Divine cannot fall at the feet of people,

32:00.720 --> 32:05.520
“Oh please, come and have your realisation!”. No, that’s too much.

32:05.720 --> 32:16.400
But there are ways and ways by which you can ask people and work it out.

32:16.600 --> 32:20.800
But I must tell you one thing, that all the Sahaja Yogis before,

32:21.000 --> 32:27.200
they started - I started Sahaja Yoga in the West and especially in England also,

32:27.400 --> 32:30.400
you see, whenever I talked to them they were very anxious

32:30.600 --> 32:35.040
how to get more people into Sahaja Yoga, how to bring more people,

32:35.240 --> 32:38.840
what to do for more people, how to manage.

32:39.040 --> 32:45.200
Or they would think somebody to be very spiritual or something,

32:45.400 --> 32:47.560
“So, Mother, can I bring that fellow?”.

32:47.760 --> 32:52.560
And he would turn out to be a horrid stuff, you see. It would burn My hands,

32:52.800 --> 32:57.160
it would burn everything, and I would say, “Now how do you mean? What made you think

32:57.360 --> 33:00.360
that he is spiritual?”. “Mother, he talks so much of spirituality”.

33:00.560 --> 33:05.320
That’s not the thing. It is a calibre, is a inner calibre

33:05.520 --> 33:08.040
a person must have. He may be an ordinary person,

33:08.240 --> 33:11.360
he may not be earning so much money, he might be on the street,

33:11.560 --> 33:13.400
but the inner calibre has to be there.

33:13.600 --> 33:19.080
Otherwise, what’s the use of breaking your head against a wall?

33:19.600 --> 33:26.440
So, this idea of having more and more is wrong.

33:27.320 --> 33:32.880
But to have people who are of that calibre,

33:33.080 --> 33:39.640
of that quality, and who deserve it. So many do not deserve it.

33:41.800 --> 33:44.880
So what to do? You cannot just... it’s not like a barber shop

33:45.080 --> 33:49.440
that you can make the head dressed the way you like.

33:49.640 --> 33:53.960
The Sahastrara has to open out.

33:54.800 --> 33:58.920
You see, the Kundalini has to come out, it has to work that way.

33:59.120 --> 34:01.640
You cannot just say, “Alright now, you got realisation”,

34:01.840 --> 34:05.240
you can’t say that way, all the time the Kundalini’s falling down,

34:05.440 --> 34:09.120
you should say, “Alright, sorry sir, I’m sorry”. Finished.

34:09.360 --> 34:15.680
And the more you show as if you are seeking elections for the votes,

34:15.880 --> 34:18.920
the more they’ll be worse.

34:19.200 --> 34:22.640
If somebody doesn’t get realisation, well and good!

34:22.840 --> 34:26.160
For example, a lady met Me in a place

34:26.360 --> 34:35.560
and she said, “I want to have realisation”. I said, “Alright, I’ll try”.

34:37.760 --> 34:41.600
Then she wrote three letters to Me, sent her photographs and she…

34:41.800 --> 34:44.520
And then she said, “I don’t know why You don’t write to me,

34:44.720 --> 34:46.720
I’ve been writing to You, this and that,

34:46.920 --> 34:52.560
I know it’s a difficult task to give a realisation”. “Oh” - so I talked to her -

34:52.760 --> 34:55.760
“Alright, when I come next in June you can come along”.

34:55.960 --> 35:01.200
But there could be somebody who might be of that calibre, you can feel it,

35:01.400 --> 35:04.800
you are knowledgeable yourself, you can feel the vibrations, you can feel it

35:05.000 --> 35:07.960
and you can then take that person seriously.

35:08.160 --> 35:15.720
So work on the people who are simple, who have that calibre.

35:15.920 --> 35:20.800
Of course, they could be very much spoilt also because of seeking,

35:21.000 --> 35:29.520
but if they are intense and sincere then the best thing is to work it out

35:30.240 --> 35:36.240
with complete assiduity and attention to such a person.

35:36.440 --> 35:39.720
But if it’s a fashion, you see, because they are going to many gurus

35:39.920 --> 35:41.960
and they are doing some, lots of guru shopping,

35:42.160 --> 35:48.240
then you should say, “There’s no shop here, you can’t pay, first of all, you can’t pay”.

35:50.560 --> 35:56.000
If they understand that, then it’s alright.

35:56.200 --> 36:00.000
Say like one fellow from the BBC came in and he said,

36:00.200 --> 36:03.880
“We can’t believe in a guru who doesn’t take any money”.

36:04.080 --> 36:07.040
I said, “Then alright, you go to such a guru who takes money from you,

36:07.240 --> 36:13.040
I’ve nothing to say”. He said - what did he say? – “Anglo Saxon brain”.

36:13.240 --> 36:17.840
I don’t know what that brain is specially, made by God or not?

36:18.040 --> 36:24.360
Cannot understand anyone who can do such a thing without money.

36:24.600 --> 36:27.800
Such a person you should say, “Alright, thank you very much, I’m sorry, you see,

36:28.000 --> 36:32.600
you are beyond me, you are too great, sorry”.

36:32.800 --> 36:37.280
Not hurting the person. But such ideas, such things if they have there in brains,

36:37.480 --> 36:44.800
you cannot break such a hard nut, can you? And you should not feel sorry for them.

36:46.280 --> 36:50.920
First see their vibrations, see their calibre. Calibre is the only way

36:51.120 --> 36:57.680
you can judge how much attention is to be paid, what is to be done.

37:00.080 --> 37:04.920
For some people it’s so obvious, so obvious.

37:05.240 --> 37:09.120
And some people go on arguing, arguing with you.

37:09.320 --> 37:11.800
But all of them now are good Sahaja Yogis

37:12.000 --> 37:15.280
despite the fact they argued quite a lot with Me to begin with;

37:15.480 --> 37:17.520
now they are very good Sahaja Yogis.

37:17.720 --> 37:20.960
But now time has come for you to have a quick result,

37:21.160 --> 37:25.200
and you will meet people who will be very good, I’m sure you’ll meet all of them

37:25.400 --> 37:30.720
who are in England and you, you will be able to manage them.

37:30.920 --> 37:34.400
Your ways, your methods, your styles will convince them.

37:34.600 --> 37:37.080
Today, only, Doctor Brian has told Me that many people

37:37.280 --> 37:40.440
are getting interested now in Sahaja Yoga, because they can see the change

37:40.640 --> 37:48.640
that comes in, the transformation, the confidence, everything that they see.

37:49.320 --> 37:54.320
So you should not try to force Sahaja Yoga on anyone;

37:54.520 --> 38:03.080
it’s better that you see their calibre. Calibre is very easy to make out.

38:03.280 --> 38:08.120
You just say it and it is there. They know, yes, that’s it.

38:13.160 --> 38:15.680
Any other question?

38:17.040 --> 38:20.400
Yogini: Shri Mataji, please, could you talk about simpathy

38:20.600 --> 38:24.280
and compassion towards other Sahaja Yogis

38:24.480 --> 38:28.240
who have problems, who have some negativity in them, please?

38:28.440 --> 38:31.440
Shri Mataji: I can’t hear. What’s it? Clearly, I didn’t hear.

38:31.640 --> 38:34.880
You also didn’t hear, I’ve seen. Yogi: Shri Mataji? Shri Mataji: Ah.

38:35.080 --> 38:37.160
Yogi: Could You speak about sympathy and compassion

38:37.360 --> 38:43.080
towards other Sahaja Yogis who have problems with negativity? Shri Mataji: Ah.

38:43.800 --> 38:48.320
Now. Sympathy and compassion;

38:48.560 --> 38:54.840
sympathy doesn’t get involved, then it’s compassion.

38:56.240 --> 39:00.760
Sympathy. ‘Sym’ means ‘share’, ‘pathy’ means ‘pathos’ –

39:00.960 --> 39:03.680
if you want to share the pathos of another person

39:03.880 --> 39:05.600
then you are sympathizing with that person.

39:05.800 --> 39:11.240
Now supposing, somebody’s husband is dead and that person is crying a lot

39:11.440 --> 39:16.840
and you also go and sit down and cry louder than her.

39:17.880 --> 39:22.880
Then people will ask you, “Did you husband die or her husband die?”.

39:24.960 --> 39:28.920
“No, no, I am just showing sympathy, you know”.

39:30.240 --> 39:36.760
This is lip sympathy, of course. Another is – may be the heartfelt sympathy.

39:38.920 --> 39:44.000
When it is heartfelt then you don’t cry;

39:45.640 --> 39:51.480
then you develop the opposite force

39:52.480 --> 39:56.400
to put that person right. What do you say to that person?

39:56.600 --> 40:04.360
You should say, “See, now if you are born you are going to die,

40:04.560 --> 40:08.440
everybody’s going to die, that’s, that’s the system.

40:08.640 --> 40:12.480
Now, two persons never die together.

40:14.200 --> 40:18.120
This gentleman who has died now, he’s your husband, alright,

40:18.320 --> 40:22.920
but now if you start crying like this, he won’t have any peace,

40:23.120 --> 40:29.000
he’ll be hovering round you, and he might be in limbo

40:29.200 --> 40:34.760
waiting for you to come there, or something like that.

40:35.160 --> 40:40.480
So no use crying over him, on the contrary, you should say, “I’m alright,

40:40.680 --> 40:44.960
don’t worry about me, I’m alright,

40:45.160 --> 40:49.080
get your realisation as I have got it".

40:49.400 --> 40:52.000
This is the opposite force that you put.

40:52.200 --> 40:58.920
This is a real, real way of helping that person.

40:59.760 --> 41:02.640
But the compassion is very different,

41:02.840 --> 41:08.440
compassion just flows, it doesn’t say anything.

41:09.680 --> 41:17.920
Even you don’t see Me, even if you are in the hospital, you know I am with you.

41:19.080 --> 41:27.480
It works. Even if you just think of Me, it works.

41:30.000 --> 41:34.960
Even if you make some mistakes, you know Mother will forgive.

41:36.040 --> 41:38.360
That’s compassion.

41:38.560 --> 41:42.440
Compassion is just flow, you don’t talk about it, you don’t say anything.

41:42.640 --> 41:47.760
It just flows and covers you completely.

41:48.600 --> 41:53.080
And you enjoy that. That’s compassion;

41:54.240 --> 42:03.040
it works - sympathy doesn’t work - compassion works, it soothes you.

42:05.440 --> 42:16.520
It’s a very beautiful touch of love, affection, kindness, protection.

42:17.920 --> 42:26.960
And you feel so confident that you are under the protection of the Divine.

42:29.920 --> 42:38.560
So, this compassion has not to be shown or to be dealt with.

42:38.760 --> 42:42.520
Now supposing, another Sahaja Yogi’s having a problem.

42:42.720 --> 42:44.960
We have only two problems;

42:45.160 --> 42:50.240
as I say, “How many turns there are in London? Only two, left or right”.

42:50.440 --> 42:55.000
In the same way, they have two problems: either left or right.

42:55.560 --> 43:00.640
If it is the left one or the right one.

43:00.840 --> 43:03.880
You know right one you have to beat with the shoes, that’s all, finished.

43:04.080 --> 43:10.120
You don’t have to go and say anything to the person, if he has right problems.

43:12.080 --> 43:16.760
Now if he has the left problem what do you do?

43:17.120 --> 43:21.840
You need not go and talk to that person: give him a bandhan,

43:22.040 --> 43:24.400
you can burn the name, you can do what you like.

43:24.600 --> 43:29.240
But you need not face the person, you need not tell the person that, “I’m helping you,

43:29.440 --> 43:33.120
I’m trying to do something for you”. That’s wrong, that’s ignorance,

43:33.320 --> 43:40.440
you don’t have to say that; it just works, it has to work by itself.

43:40.640 --> 43:43.440
But I don’t tell you that I’m going to help you in any way, do I?

43:43.640 --> 43:54.280
Nothing of the kind. Wherever you are you know I’m with you, all the time.

43:54.960 --> 43:59.200
In the same way, this compassion will work whether you are sitting down here,

43:59.400 --> 44:04.040
if you are beating somebody with shoes that person will come round.

44:04.240 --> 44:09.640
So they have only two problems, one is the left or the right.

44:10.360 --> 44:15.840
If you try to sympathize with any one of them you are in trouble.

44:17.440 --> 44:23.600
So best thing is not to directly help them, but indirectly.

44:25.400 --> 44:31.200
Not to tell them that you are helping, not even mention it to them;

44:31.400 --> 44:38.560
the concern is the point, the concern about a person.

44:38.760 --> 44:42.640
Your attention should go there, your attention is very active.

44:42.840 --> 44:47.320
It’s a very powerful thing you have got, your attention acts.

44:47.520 --> 44:51.560
Just put your attention to that person, with a concern,

44:51.760 --> 44:57.480
but no involvement: that is compassion.

44:57.680 --> 45:01.240
You have got it, you have got the power of compassion

45:01.440 --> 45:06.720
in your attention now, you haven’t used it.

45:06.920 --> 45:13.760
Without taking any credit for it, without showing it, without confronting it,

45:13.960 --> 45:19.640
just inside yourself you feel it, it will work out.

45:19.840 --> 45:25.200
But for that you have to cleanse your own attention, that’s very important.

45:25.400 --> 45:30.880
If your attention is loose type, if your connection is not alright,

45:31.080 --> 45:37.560
then it won’t work out. But if you have that kind of an attention

45:37.760 --> 45:48.120
which is silent, which is witnessing, which is not involved, it’s dynamic, it works!

45:48.320 --> 45:55.240
All of you have to become like Me, I’m sure you all can,

45:55.720 --> 45:59.640
and achieve that calibre of compassion.

45:59.840 --> 46:06.600
Alright? Do you follow now? Thank you.

46:16.480 --> 46:22.280
Any other question, Hester? No?

46:26.720 --> 46:32.920
Danya has any questions? You never had them.

46:33.120 --> 46:40.560
Anybody else? Jason? None!

46:42.120 --> 46:45.680
Question-less people, I tell you.

46:53.800 --> 47:01.560
Best way is to enjoy others. Best way is to enjoy others;

47:01.760 --> 47:08.080
and to enjoy yourself is to laugh at yourself, that’s the best way.

47:08.320 --> 47:13.760
Address yourself, “You, Mister, now come along, this is ego, I know.

47:13.960 --> 47:19.920
Ah, that’s it, that’s the one! No no no no no no no no no, not me!

47:20.120 --> 47:23.040
I’ve had enough of it”.

47:24.160 --> 47:27.440
That’s how you enjoy yourself.

47:29.920 --> 47:33.120
And enjoy others, seeing their good points.

47:33.320 --> 47:40.200
Sweet, sweet things they do, very sweet things. You don’t have to say anything.

47:40.400 --> 47:43.920
And we had 71 marriages, you can’t believe it.

47:44.120 --> 47:48.600
And I looked at the brides and they were all looking at Me from the angles, you see;

47:48.800 --> 47:55.160
and the eyes were telling the story of their love and gratitude,

47:55.360 --> 47:58.640
and I don’t know what all they said.

47:58.880 --> 48:02.160
I was just watching them when they were walking

48:02.360 --> 48:05.800
with their garlands in their hands, slowly, slowly;

48:06.000 --> 48:15.080
the sweetness, the beauty of their feelings; very slowly they were walking.

48:15.320 --> 48:23.880
And then I saw the boys standing there, looking at Me

48:25.080 --> 48:29.880
with tremendous feeling of oneness.

48:31.240 --> 48:35.040
You see, this cannot be enjoyed otherwise.

48:35.240 --> 48:38.680
Even with the body you cannot enjoy, supposing you rub your hand,

48:38.880 --> 48:48.600
you won’t enjoy that much as you enjoy other people, other sahaja yogis.

48:50.240 --> 48:56.040
And then the friends doing the leg-pulling also I enjoy,

48:56.440 --> 49:01.280
the way they talk to each other I enjoy, everything’s so enjoyable,

49:01.480 --> 49:06.280
it doesn’t hurt anyone, it doesn’t trouble anyone.

49:07.680 --> 49:13.960
You are here to enjoy, God has created this universe for you to enjoy.

49:14.440 --> 49:18.720
So only thing is that you must improve your attention,

49:18.920 --> 49:22.960
cleanse your attention by meditation,

49:24.160 --> 49:29.480
always think of good things, not of bad things.

49:30.280 --> 49:34.320
You should not react too much, just be within yourself,

49:34.520 --> 49:37.520
see for yourself, witness everything.

49:37.720 --> 49:43.960
And you’ll be amazed, you’ll see beautiful points, beautiful things all around you.

49:44.160 --> 49:52.320
So much of beauty which we are losing because we cannot see it.

49:52.880 --> 49:57.440
So that deep, penetrating attention of concern

49:57.640 --> 50:01.240
will solve all the problems, I’m sure.

50:04.560 --> 50:07.760
But ‘open your heart’ doesn’t mean that you go and hug somebody

50:07.960 --> 50:10.480
and kiss somebody ten times, it doesn’t mean that at all.

50:10.680 --> 50:15.000
On the contrary, it can be quite embarrassing, you know?

50:20.320 --> 50:23.480
Any other questions?

50:36.240 --> 50:42.040
I, I had a problem there, you see, we, they arranged a programme for Me

50:42.240 --> 50:46.000
to speak to the young presidents’ organisation,

50:46.200 --> 50:51.720
the presidents of big, big – of big, big organisations,

50:51.920 --> 50:55.560
business organisations, and I had to speak to them.

50:55.760 --> 51:00.000
And one of the lady - of course, I mean - the questions were

51:00.200 --> 51:02.880
very good and everything flowing (?) over, and later on she says,

51:03.080 --> 51:07.920
“But I can’t believe it, because she is not at all serious, you see”.

51:09.480 --> 51:11.760
And I laughed and laughed and laughed with that, I said,

51:11.960 --> 51:16.240
“Now I cannot be serious anymore, that was too much”.

51:17.080 --> 51:20.760
When there’s so much joy bubbling out, why, how can you be serious?

51:20.960 --> 51:25.720
This is the idea of a saint that he should be very serious, stern,

51:25.920 --> 51:33.160
going out with a stick in his hand all the time hitting everyone on the head.

51:36.160 --> 51:41.320
So, any other question (indistinct word)? No.

51:46.840 --> 51:48.480
We must have a hall here, big hall

51:48.680 --> 51:53.840
we should buy somewhere, we should be able to buy.

51:54.240 --> 51:57.280
I’m thankful to people who are working on Shudy Camp but I think

51:57.480 --> 51:59.800
you must hurry up now,

52:00.000 --> 52:04.120
people are coming for Guru Puja, I told them we’ll have it in Shudy Camp.

52:04.320 --> 52:07.280
And otherwise if it is not ready we’ll have to change the venue,

52:07.480 --> 52:11.080
so everybody must go and work it out, I think, is important.

52:11.280 --> 52:15.120
We have money, we have no problem on that.

52:15.480 --> 52:20.600
We have to have a nice, grand, beautiful

52:21.840 --> 52:26.040
seminar before Guru Puja. And there are many coming here,

52:26.240 --> 52:33.440
you’ll meet all of them, will be a very nice time, real festival we’ll be having.

52:33.960 --> 52:38.480
So it would be better that you, all of you combine together and work it out

52:38.680 --> 52:44.160
and also give different work to different people;

52:44.360 --> 52:50.720
and they should all try to organize it in a beautiful way

52:50.920 --> 52:54.720
that there’s no quarrel, nothing. But you’ll see people, you see, will say,

52:54.920 --> 52:59.720
“Oh! This is the room I would like to have for my wife”, things like that.

52:59.920 --> 53:02.920
Sounds stupidity.

53:04.400 --> 53:08.680
“This is the glass for me, I can’t give it to you”.

53:08.960 --> 53:13.520
All such stupid things will be there, and I think, for such people you should say,

53:13.720 --> 53:17.840
“You are not for Guru Puja, better not be here”.

53:18.560 --> 53:22.440
Everybody doesn’t deserve to be there.

53:23.560 --> 53:26.560
That’s you should find out, that what sort of people they are.

53:26.760 --> 53:29.920
If they are fighting for all these little, little things it’s best is to tell them

53:30.120 --> 53:34.440
that, “Sorry, you’d better not come for Guru Puja”.

53:40.720 --> 53:44.480
So, the most important thing is that in Guru Puja we have to receive

53:44.680 --> 53:50.000
a special capacity to be a guru ourselves.

53:50.200 --> 53:54.600
A special intelligence, a special understanding,

53:54.800 --> 53:58.600
a kind of a wisdom which gives you discretion

53:58.800 --> 54:02.600
and the ability to argue out things.

54:03.760 --> 54:07.160
That will enhance your personality,

54:07.760 --> 54:17.320
a beautiful, dignified personality can be created within yourselves,

54:17.520 --> 54:21.560
so for that you have to be there

54:21.760 --> 54:27.560
with all that dedication and understanding about yourself.

54:29.360 --> 54:33.560
So I’m looking forward to this Guru Puja, and everybody has to write.

54:33.760 --> 54:39.000
Now for Sahastrara day they are working so hard, the people from Australia

54:39.200 --> 54:42.800
have printed so many posters, all over the world they have sent it,

54:43.000 --> 54:46.680
they have sent it to you also the posters of Sahastrar Day - have you brought it?

54:46.880 --> 54:50.080
No? You haven’t shown them.

54:57.880 --> 55:00.760
So next time you must show all of them, they should see that,

55:00.960 --> 55:04.320
what they have done, how much; and you must -

55:04.520 --> 55:07.680
we have no, nothing like a news from there and this thing - but all this

55:07.880 --> 55:10.680
can be discussed among yourself; and you should know about each other,

55:10.880 --> 55:13.960
what’s happening, where, and what ashram is doing,

55:14.160 --> 55:20.160
what is the special work they are doing, and what is the new thing they have discovered;

55:20.360 --> 55:25.800
all sorts of things you can find out from each other. And you can tell others also.

55:26.000 --> 55:30.280
This is how you keep in communication with each other.

55:30.480 --> 55:34.480
Oh, there’s a very good news, that Doctor Rai,

55:34.680 --> 55:40.160
who is the Dean of the Faculty of Physiology in Delhi University,

55:40.360 --> 55:46.440
started a research work on the comparative study of Sahaja Yogis and others

55:46.640 --> 55:50.480
as far as the physiology is concerned. And he’s found out that the people

55:50.680 --> 56:00.920
who are not Sahaja Yogis have a very low resistance for diseases,

56:01.120 --> 56:04.680
their skin, skin resistance is less and so many things he’s found out.

56:04.880 --> 56:08.320
And he has put it on, he’s tabulated the whole thing,

56:08.520 --> 56:13.040
and that is been now approved by the Government and is now published,

56:13.240 --> 56:16.840
going to be published also. In the same way, you see,

56:17.040 --> 56:21.960
we are thinking of having a research here done for people in Shudy Camp,

56:22.160 --> 56:25.240
so that we can also publish something like that with the research.

56:25.440 --> 56:28.760
That so far, you see, so many have been cured, so many got rid

56:28.960 --> 56:32.880
of their addictions, so many got rid of their mental problems,

56:33.120 --> 56:36.320
so many things happened; but we haven’t yet recorded it,

56:36.520 --> 56:40.520
we have not put it properly on the record. Now this is what we are going to do now,

56:40.720 --> 56:44.480
anybody who has achieved something or has felt better

56:44.680 --> 56:47.040
or has been cured or something like that

56:47.240 --> 56:50.480
must give it in writing to these people so they record it,

56:50.680 --> 56:55.840
because, you see, in these modern times they want everything in black and white,

56:56.040 --> 56:59.040
so that could be done very well here in England.

56:59.240 --> 57:01.800
Another thing I was thinking that now “Nirmala Yoga”

57:02.000 --> 57:06.720
has stopped there because of this problem of foreign exchange.

57:06.920 --> 57:12.280
So what we can do is to have a “Nirmala Yog” published in India

57:12.480 --> 57:16.960
and sent here, and you can print it here and sell it here,

57:17.160 --> 57:19.360
so that the foreign exchange problem doesn’t come in.

57:19.560 --> 57:21.760
Because foreign exchange is such a problem in that country,

57:21.960 --> 57:27.640
you have to have a proper committee, this, that, all headaches.

57:27.840 --> 57:31.920
So you can sell them here and distribute them here,

57:32.120 --> 57:36.160
it’s very easy, and Paul can help you there. Paul, can’t you? (Paul: Yes...)

57:36.360 --> 57:40.680
Yes. So it’s alright. We get the “Nirmala Yog” done there

57:40.880 --> 57:43.840
and just the copy sent here, translated.

57:44.040 --> 57:46.960
You can also add to it, you can also put something into it

57:47.160 --> 57:49.400
and some things from there and some things from here;

57:49.600 --> 57:56.080
you can distribute it to all the centres here and we can start like that.

57:56.280 --> 57:59.880
Because they created a big problem out of that last “Nirmala Yoga”,

58:00.080 --> 58:03.720
I’ve just stopped it, because you see we, we are not very good

58:03.920 --> 58:08.400
at human laws, I think, sometimes you make mistakes and I don’t want

58:08.600 --> 58:12.840
you people to be caught up into these human laws. So you have to be careful.

58:13.040 --> 58:17.760
And we can do it, I think we can do it. And as England is the heart

58:17.960 --> 58:21.280
it has to circulate everything.

58:24.000 --> 58:29.240
But the hearts must open out. The conditioning is very bad here,

58:29.440 --> 58:34.040
you see, that you are told that you should not express your feelings,

58:34.240 --> 58:37.560
you should not say anything, you should be very poised,

58:37.760 --> 58:42.440
you should not talk about your feelings. That’s not so in Sahaja Yoga.

58:42.640 --> 58:46.560
This is the heart and heart must speak, heart must say;

58:46.760 --> 58:51.840
you must know how to say that you love others. It’s very easy to say ‘I hate’,

58:52.040 --> 58:58.280
but it’s very difficult for people to say ‘I love you’. Because they are afraid,

58:58.480 --> 59:01.560
that if you commit like this, “Oh, so you love me?

59:01.760 --> 59:06.320
So do this for me. You love me? So do this for me.

59:07.400 --> 59:09.720
How dare you say you love me, if you have loved me

59:09.920 --> 59:13.920
you must do all this and you must give this to me”.

59:15.400 --> 59:18.360
Oh, we had some Sahaja Yogis like that.

59:18.560 --> 59:21.160
They were abusing Me also that, “You said you love us,

59:21.360 --> 59:24.680
then why don’t You do this for us?”.

59:25.240 --> 59:28.640
Then it becomes a demanding love.

59:30.720 --> 59:34.600
Any other question anywhere?

59:35.680 --> 59:41.880
What’s happening, John, about your priesthood?

59:45.120 --> 59:48.560
They are getting quite exposed. (John: Yes, Mother.)

59:48.760 --> 59:52.120
Exposure is the only way, but still nothing goes into the heads of the people,

59:52.320 --> 59:54.560
they are so egoistical, nobody wants to accept

59:54.760 --> 59:58.200
that it’s all exposed now within – ‘No, it is fanaticism, it is nonsense’.

59:58.400 --> 01:00:01.880
But still they go on with it, what to do?

01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:32.680
Beautiful children you have here.

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:36.880
How many are new people who are seeing Me for the first time?

01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:42.080
Raise your hands please. Ah!

01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:48.240
Ah, you all look little serious!

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:57.000
Still rather serious. You shouldn’t be serious at all. Good. Nice.

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:14.080
Get the children. He is just hitting the head.

01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:25.440
Who is the child crying there so much? Whose child?

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:32.160
(A yogi says something inaudible) This child? What’s the matter?

01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:37.520
Must be hot. Take out the sweater. Eh?

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:46.520
(Somebody says something) It’s alright.

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:56.720
I think, must be hot for the child. And they feel very thirsty also,

01:01:56.920 --> 01:02:01.960
you see, these are places where you don’t have any humidity much,

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:06.600
so they feel very thirsty also in such places, I think.

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:22.520
All of them cry the same, whether they are Indians, English, anything!

01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:28.800
From their crying you can’t make out what race they come from.

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:39.480
Now better? Have you got some water or something?

01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:45.480
See! You must understand your children, they won’t cry without a reason.

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:49.040
They are all realised souls.

01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:07.360
Alright. Thank you, thank you very much.

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:13.040
Anything else?

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:24.400
(Someone asks an inaudible question.)

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:26.680
Shri Mataji: Can you say…? Yogi: How can you best cope

01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:30.080
if you have to work in a negative situation? Shri Mataji: In your office?

01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:32.760
Yogi: Job, yes. Shri Mataji: Negativity in the office?

01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:37.880
Yogi: Yes, Shri Mataji. Shri Mataji: You see, all the negativity

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:44.720
have also, has also an aspect which I call is ridiculous and humorous;

01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:47.360
so anybody who is negative or anything

01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:50.480
you watch it, see for yourself, don’t get involved,

01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:56.880
just see which part it is, is it ridiculous or it is humorous.

01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:03.680
Then you won’t be serious about it.

01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:15.040
Sahaja Yogis have a sense of ridiculous,

01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:17.920
you see, they understand what is ridiculous is;

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:22.840
also they understand what is humorous or what is stupid.

01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:28.840
So just see that, it is stupid? Alright, let it be, doesn’t matter, what can you do?

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:35.280
These children are growing so fast, you know.

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:38.160
They’re so becoming all tall, girls and all that.

01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:41.800
I’m just trying to make them out one after another.
