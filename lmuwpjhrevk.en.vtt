00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.200
I’m just watching all the beauty.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.000
You looked so beautiful at the airport.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:59.680
Such a joy for me to see you in that shape.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.360
It’s a

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:16.640
rare occasion sometimes

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:28.760
that you feel oneness with the whole universe,

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:35.040
absolutely oneness with the whole universe,

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:44.160
when you feel the love that exists between all of you.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.680
It’s the love between you,

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.960
oneness between you,

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:57.880
the way you all have opened your heart to each other

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:05.600
as good human beings, as realized souls, as saints -

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:20.760
it’s the most fulfilling and satisfying thing for Me.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:31.960
When a saint used to meet another saint, say in India, what would happen?

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:40.640
There was a saint in Maharashtra who was a tailor, but he was a saint.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:45.640
Saint is a saint whether he’s a tailor or he could be anything.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:51.160
And there was another saint who was a potter,

00:07:51.360 --> 00:08:00.000
who used to make pots, and things like that, out of clay.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:14.320
So this saint, Namadeva, went to see this potter

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:20.760
who was making some pots out of clay.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:27.880
And he looked at him.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.440
And the feeling that came into his heart is expressed -

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:40.960
he was a great poet also, Namadeva - so he says,

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:50.000
in Marathi it is, but I’ll translate it in English - “I came here

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:57.920
to see the Chaitanya, the formless,

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:03.200
but the formless is standing before me in the form”.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:07.200
So to appreciate

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:15.480
the other saint he said, “Now the whole Chaitanya, the whole

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:22.360
all-pervading power of God’s love has come in your form before me.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.880
I see it”.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.840
How to address, just think of it.

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:34.200
At that moment, spontaneously he said this.

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:42.920
That is how you are all saints, and saints have to see that,

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:50.480
that you are the form of that love of God’s all pervading power.

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:55.000
You are in the form of that, all of you.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:10:00.520
I think that day, you were standing in the rain and sleet

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:04.200
with all your children. For a Mother it’s too much

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:09.520
to see, such beautiful feelings for me.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:13.440
But the feelings among yourselves,

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:19.600
the open-heartedness, the Pure love,

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:25.040
that filled the whole atmosphere with such beauty.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:28.640
It’s not just talking,

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:36.920
it’s not just writing letters or sending Birthday cards or something like that;

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.920
it’s from the heart,

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:46.000
you have to feel each other that you are all saints.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:52.840
You are different people, you have to support each other,

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:56.800
you have to look after each other, you have to understand each other

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.760
because you are the people of a different awareness

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:06.720
living among people who are blind, who can hit you,

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:11.840
they can do some harm to you.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:21.160
The other day I was reading Gyaneshwara; can you imagine,

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:25.120
he died at the age of 23 years,

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.920
at such an young age as 23 years.

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:36.160
And the Gyaneshwari he wrote was at the age of 21 years. And what a genius!

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:42.200
I mean, you read it, you just don’t understand,

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:49.680
how could he penetrate so deep. He described you all,

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:56.040
as I have told you many-a-times he has described you

00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:09.840
as the oceans of, the walking oceans of Ambrose - Ambrosia.

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:22.240
Talking trees, and the forest of

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:35.680
the trees of bliss and beauty.

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.320
That wherever you’ll go you’ll bless people.

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:43.000
Wherever you will stand you’ll be auspicious,

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:47.760
you will create harmony, peace and joy.

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:53.960
That’s your work, that’s your style, that’s what you are here for.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:59.240
But beware, you ought to be very careful,

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:03.440
because the surroundings seem to be quite deceptive

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:06.520
and quite troublesome.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:15.440
And from that surrounding you are coming out suddenly into a new surrounding

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:22.040
where you have known what is Divine love, what is Divinity.

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:29.600
One has to be very careful because the forces that are negative

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:38.280
are very strong, and working at you all the time,

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:45.640
because you’ve come from matter, you have evolved from matter

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:58.640
and it’s easy to go to matter, to materialism, to the materialistic ideas;

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:07.960
and this materialism takes you to primitiveness.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:11.320
All your culture, all your beauty will drop out

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:18.360
as soon as you take to materialism. If everything becomes money

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:24.520
there’s no place for God, no place for love,

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:32.200
no place for beauty or for any graciousness.

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:39.920
Money is for us, we are not for the money.

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:43.280
Money should be at our command.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:49.800
We don’t have to give up anything for that.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:15:00.160
And here then we see the materialism coming up in a very different way,

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:05.400
very subtle ways, and we do not see it.

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:10.040
When we start saying “my, mine, this is mine”

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:16.880
then you are slowly drifting towards materialism.

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:22.880
When you see yourself in the collective,

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:31.360
that’s the only way you can get out of materialism.

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:35.000
Because you are in reality a collective being.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:39.480
You are not an individual that way.

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:43.800
But the matter divides you from each other.

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.360
And when you realize

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:53.280
that we are not slaves of matter, matter is our slave,

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:58.480
we are not going to be dominated by any matter,

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:04.160
then you can feel that love.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:10.040
One goes to absurd limits if you take to materialism;

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:15.440
and everything can be explained in the name of materialism.

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:22.880
But in the name of Divine how far can you go and explain?

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.920
You have to just enjoy it.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:31.440
When you enjoy you don’t want to explain or talk about it, you just want to enjoy.

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.640
Divinity is to be enjoyed within and without.

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:41.400
It’s within you, divinity is within you, but is to be enjoyed.

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:45.040
That’s only possible if you understand

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:49.680
that you are not going to be dominated by any matter whatsoever.

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:54.840
I’m sorry I’m here for such a short time,

00:16:55.040 --> 00:17:00.360
I wish I could be with you forever, which I am, I think.

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:05.360
But you have brothers and sisters everywhere,

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:13.160
the whole world has this message with them.

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:16.240
You, some of you have met them in India.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:21.080
All the Indians have sent their love to you, lots of love,

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:24.800
and they didn’t know what to send you from there, something special;

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.320
so they sent Me.

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:44.280
Sometimes I feel all of us should meet somewhere; all of us

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:48.720
from all over the world, from every corner of the world, all the great saints

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:53.880
who are in these modern times should meet each other, talk to each other,

00:17:54.080 --> 00:18:02.040
enjoy each other and understand each other.

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:10.560
That’s the time we’ll think that a new era has started

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:18.680
of love, of trust, of enjoyment of other human beings.

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:21.640
When you start enjoying another person

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:26.280
then only we can say that you are in the collective.

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:32.560
Like My finger, if it pains the another one tries to soothe it,

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:36.600
and I feel the soothing, without feeling any gratitude

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:41.800
or without feeling any sort of a obligation.

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:49.680
So always I say about collectivity. Those who cannot be collective,

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:54.440
those who cannot open their hearts, those who keep aloof,

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:58.680
those who think they are - some of them might be thinking “We are great Sahaja Yogis

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:02.040
because we are very old Sahaja Yogis,” some might be thinking

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:07.280
“we are very intelligent”, some that “we are rich, and poor” and all that,

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:13.800
all these differences should disappear. Who is crying?

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:23.880
She’s crying? What’s the matter?

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:28.960
(Yogini speaks: “Clapping made him jump”. Yogi: “The clapping made him jump, Mother”.

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:32.200
Shri Mataji: “And loudly?” Yogi: “The clapping made the baby jump, Shri Mataji”.

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:35.440
Oh!

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:50.280
One day they’ll all grow up. I was thinking when they’ll grow up

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:55.000
they’ll clap much more than you will do!

00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:01.000
Little more time we need, somehow.

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:06.000
All these great people will be becoming great Sahaja Yogis

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:13.960
and will give us such a pleasure, such a joy, such a happiness.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:20.080
Today I wanted to speak about something,

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:23.080
but I’ll just put it as a question to you all.

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:26.960
And I would like to have an answer from you.

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:31.560
You can write to Me and let’s see, or you can discuss.

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:43.320
That as formerly, as other saints have said,

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:49.000
that once you get your realization you are lost,

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:55.520
you can’t speak about it. You can just tell them by some similes, metaphors,

00:20:55.760 --> 00:21:05.680
this, that, but you cannot really give them the experience by telling them.

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:10.600
And that’s why many saints decided that after realization

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:15.040
it’s better to disappear. Even Gyaneshwara took his samadhi,

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:20.200
he went into a room and he died in that room.

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:26.280
Because they could not say much about it, they could not tell much about it.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:29.640
But today that’s not the situation.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.040
Like Kabira has said that,

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:40.160
“When a drop becomes the ocean, what can you say?”.

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:45.200
You are lost, you are no more there, you are all finished.

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:49.000
So what has happened in Sahaja Yoga, today’s Sahaja Yoga,

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:53.800
that we are all talking about it, experiencing it and enjoying it?

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.440
That’s the question for all of the Sahaja Yogis to solve.

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:09.040
(Smiles and talks to somebody. Name not clear, sounds like “Elliot”.)

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:11.800
You can explain?

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:16.760
Did you hear My question?

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:21.080
No? You didn’t hear My question

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:26.200
You see, what I said was that formerly

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:31.040
those people who got realisation got lost, alright?

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:36.200
As you were lost just now into thoughtless awareness!

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:45.040
But you can come back and you can tell people, you can talk about it,

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:49.160
and many people disappeared.

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:54.360
Actually, they didn’t want to live after getting realization for a long time,

00:22:54.600 --> 00:23:00.120
because they could not explain, talk to people about it.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:05.360
Also they said that, "How can a person who has no tongue

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:11.720
tell about the taste of the jiggery?", it’s a kind of sweet.

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:17.760
So there was a problem with them, all of them had a problem.

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:20.280
But now you don’t have that problem.

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:25.240
So what has happened in Sahaja Yoga that you have no problem?

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:30.120
So think it over and write to Me, alright?

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:39.720
So I don’t know what to say anymore.

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:44.840
Just we are enjoying our rapport with each other, isn’t it?

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:49.280
That’s all, sitting down here. Anybody has any questions?

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:55.000
Anybody who is a new person can ask a question, would be good idea.

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:04.640
Because these people have no questions now.

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:12.560
Ask Me a question.

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:22.800
(To somebody) I’ve heard the good news. Ah!

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.400
Yogi: Shri Mataji, how should we approach the spreading of Sahaja Yoga?

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:28.520
Shri Mataji: How can we…? Yogi: How should we approach

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:31.240
the spreading of Sahaja Yoga to new people?

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:34.200
Shri Mataji: What? Another yogi: He said how should we approach

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:38.760
the spreading of Sahaja Yoga to new people, to the new people.

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.200
How should we express Sahaja Yoga, Shri Mataji?

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:48.400
Shri Mataji: To them? Now, you see, you’ll meet three types of new people.

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:51.720
Firstly, those who are yogis,

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:56.320
or you can call them as people of previous births,

00:24:56.520 --> 00:25:00.920
who are already very knowledgeable and are there,

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:04.160
just they can feel it, this is it;

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:09.000
you won’t have much problem with them, they’ll know it is so.

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:18.400
To them it’s very obvious, and you’ll be amazed the way they are there,

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:23.120
how they have taken to it so easily.

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:32.720
Now the second type are the people who may be still believing, non believing,

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:38.320
maybe some who are doubting, maybe;

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:45.440
or maybe some who are asking questions about it, quite a lot.

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:52.360
So is not sufficient only for you to get your realization,

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:58.080
also not sufficient for you that you feel the vibrations

00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:04.240
and that you can give realizations to others, that won’t help much.

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:13.640
You have to know how to deal with various types of people.

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:22.880
Like I would say a person who is a, say, a priest,

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:28.960
who comes to you and wants to talk to you about God, this, that and all that.

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:32.640
So you must know Bible very well,

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:37.080
and know Bible in the way a Sahaja Yogi should know.

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:39.840
The other day Rustom telephoned to tell Me that -

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:47.840
I told him to study Koran because, I said, Islam means surrender,

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:52.080
but before realisation surrender has no meaning.

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:54.320
And he’s told Me that it’s written in Koran

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:57.480
that unless and until you are connected with God

00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:03.240
you cannot understand anything what is written here. It’s clearly said.

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.840
Now when the Muslims talk to you, you can tell them:

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:10.240
“This is written in Koran, are you connected with God?”.

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:14.840
Now, they might say, “Are you connected?”.

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:20.880
Now, then if you say, “Yes”, then finished!

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:27.640
Then Mr. Ego will come up, you see, suddenly, and you be careful!

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:34.120
So this subject should be treated with a barge pole.

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:42.800
Like, such a question if they ask… you see they will be like that, “Are you that?”.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.160
Like in the beginning they used to ask Me, “What’s your Father?

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:49.080
What’s your Mother? Who are you?". This, that, all those things, you see.

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:53.600
So at that time you have to give an answer to them -

00:27:55.480 --> 00:28:00.400
Can you give this lady a chair to sit down? (Hindi) Sit down.

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:07.680
No… Alright. (Hindi) Sit down... Sit down.

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:22.240
So such a question if you answer in that manner

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:26.880
you have not been clever enough; you have to be very clever.

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:36.480
Then you should say, "You see, there are" - avoid the subject, don’t answer;

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:44.200
you just say, “See, there are descriptions about a person who is a realised soul”.

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:50.720
Jung has said that you have to become collectively conscious.

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:53.760
Now, what is collectively conscious?

00:28:53.960 --> 00:29:00.720
That is, on your central nervous system you should be able to feel another person.

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:08.480
Now Jung has said so, it’s a poet.

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:12.600
Then you have got other people to quote:

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:16.160
William Blake you can quote,

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:21.440
you can quote other poets or saints whom you know,

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:25.560
it depends on what sort of a person you are dealing with.

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:29.000
But just don’t say, ”Yes, I am a realised soul”.

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:34.400
People have been crucified, murdered, poisoned for saying that.

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:39.600
So be careful, put it on somebody else and say,

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:45.440
“Yes, the signs of a realised soul’s are like this,

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:48.840
that he has to be collectively conscious”.

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:51.000
First of all that you have read Jung

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:54.440
or you know so much about collective consciousness itself

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:59.440
will put them right in their own places, to begin with.

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:03.000
Because you have to be knowledgeable in these modern times,

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:06.560
and you should be able to communicate.

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:10.160
Just by telling them, “I’m a realized soul,

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:14.920
I have to awaken your Kundalini”, nobody is going to believe you.

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:21.280
Even in India people don’t believe that we can give realisation -

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:25.520
although they know about realisation, they know about Kundalini, they know everything,

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:30.040
but still they cannot believe that we, like ordinary people,

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:33.280
can give realisation to them.

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:39.120
So in no way you should be diffident, but try to bring them round

00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:43.040
through somebody else, because the human nature is such,

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:48.200
the one who is living, the one who is existing, they don’t want to accept.

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:53.680
Whosoever is dead, you see, and written somewhere, anything, in black and white,

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:58.640
and if you say in this book this is this written, they’ll accept.

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:02.120
That’s why you have to be knowledgeable, you must read books

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:08.760
which are supportive of your realisation, supportive of Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:13.600
Then only you can talk to them. If you are just having realisation,

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:17.600
you can give realisation, you have got vibrations, that won’t work out -

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:25.480
especially in the Western countries where people are too much here, nothing there.

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:30.320
You have to tell them that we are also intelligent enough,

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:37.880
and we also understand it with our brains and logic, what is the truth is.

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:44.960
Then after their realisation, of course, it’s much easier,

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:51.120
but if you say, "Alright, come along, I have to give you realisation” - you cannot.

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:55.360
You cannot force them, you cannot - they have to ask for it,

00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:58.160
after all there is a protocol of the Divine also,

00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:00.520
the Divine cannot fall at the feet of people,

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:05.520
“Oh please, come and have your realisation!”. No, that’s too much.

00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:16.400
But there are ways and ways by which you can ask people and work it out.

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:20.800
But I must tell you one thing, that all the Sahaja Yogis before,

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:27.200
they started - I started Sahaja Yoga in the West and especially in England also,

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:30.400
you see, whenever I talked to them they were very anxious

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:35.040
how to get more people into Sahaja Yoga, how to bring more people,

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:38.840
what to do for more people, how to manage.

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:45.200
Or they would think somebody to be very spiritual or something,

00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:47.560
“So, Mother, can I bring that fellow?”.

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:52.560
And he would turn out to be a horrid stuff, you see. It would burn My hands,

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:57.160
it would burn everything, and I would say, “Now how do you mean? What made you think

00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:00.360
that he is spiritual?”. “Mother, he talks so much of spirituality”.

00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:05.320
That’s not the thing. It is a calibre, is a inner calibre

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:08.040
a person must have. He may be an ordinary person,

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:11.360
he may not be earning so much money, he might be on the street,

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:13.400
but the inner calibre has to be there.

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:19.080
Otherwise, what’s the use of breaking your head against a wall?

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:26.440
So, this idea of having more and more is wrong.

00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:32.880
But to have people who are of that calibre,

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:39.640
of that quality, and who deserve it. So many do not deserve it.

00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:44.880
So what to do? You cannot just... it’s not like a barber shop

00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:49.440
that you can make the head dressed the way you like.

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:53.960
The Sahastrara has to open out.

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:58.920
You see, the Kundalini has to come out, it has to work that way.

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:01.640
You cannot just say, “Alright now, you got realisation”,

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:05.240
you can’t say that way, all the time the Kundalini’s falling down,

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:09.120
you should say, “Alright, sorry sir, I’m sorry”. Finished.

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:15.680
And the more you show as if you are seeking elections for the votes,

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:18.920
the more they’ll be worse.

00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:22.640
If somebody doesn’t get realisation, well and good!

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:26.160
For example, a lady met Me in a place

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:35.560
and she said, “I want to have realisation”. I said, “Alright, I’ll try”.

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:41.600
Then she wrote three letters to Me, sent her photographs and she…

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:44.520
And then she said, “I don’t know why You don’t write to me,

00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:46.720
I’ve been writing to You, this and that,

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:52.560
I know it’s a difficult task to give a realisation”. “Oh” - so I talked to her -

00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:55.760
“Alright, when I come next in June you can come along”.

00:34:55.960 --> 00:35:01.200
But there could be somebody who might be of that calibre, you can feel it,

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:04.800
you are knowledgeable yourself, you can feel the vibrations, you can feel it

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.960
and you can then take that person seriously.

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:15.720
So work on the people who are simple, who have that calibre.

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:20.800
Of course, they could be very much spoilt also because of seeking,

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:29.520
but if they are intense and sincere then the best thing is to work it out

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:36.240
with complete assiduity and attention to such a person.

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:39.720
But if it’s a fashion, you see, because they are going to many gurus

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:41.960
and they are doing some, lots of guru shopping,

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:48.240
then you should say, “There’s no shop here, you can’t pay, first of all, you can’t pay”.

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:56.000
If they understand that, then it’s alright.

00:35:56.200 --> 00:36:00.000
Say like one fellow from the BBC came in and he said,

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:03.880
“We can’t believe in a guru who doesn’t take any money”.

00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:07.040
I said, “Then alright, you go to such a guru who takes money from you,

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:13.040
I’ve nothing to say”. He said - what did he say? – “Anglo Saxon brain”.

00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:17.840
I don’t know what that brain is specially, made by God or not?

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:24.360
Cannot understand anyone who can do such a thing without money.

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:27.800
Such a person you should say, “Alright, thank you very much, I’m sorry, you see,

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.600
you are beyond me, you are too great, sorry”.

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:37.280
Not hurting the person. But such ideas, such things if they have there in brains,

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:44.800
you cannot break such a hard nut, can you? And you should not feel sorry for them.

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:50.920
First see their vibrations, see their calibre. Calibre is the only way

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:57.680
you can judge how much attention is to be paid, what is to be done.

00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:04.920
For some people it’s so obvious, so obvious.

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:09.120
And some people go on arguing, arguing with you.

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:11.800
But all of them now are good Sahaja Yogis

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.280
despite the fact they argued quite a lot with Me to begin with;

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:17.520
now they are very good Sahaja Yogis.

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:20.960
But now time has come for you to have a quick result,

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:25.200
and you will meet people who will be very good, I’m sure you’ll meet all of them

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:30.720
who are in England and you, you will be able to manage them.

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:34.400
Your ways, your methods, your styles will convince them.

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:37.080
Today, only, Doctor Brian has told Me that many people

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:40.440
are getting interested now in Sahaja Yoga, because they can see the change

00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:48.640
that comes in, the transformation, the confidence, everything that they see.

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:54.320
So you should not try to force Sahaja Yoga on anyone;

00:37:54.520 --> 00:38:03.080
it’s better that you see their calibre. Calibre is very easy to make out.

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:08.120
You just say it and it is there. They know, yes, that’s it.

00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:15.680
Any other question?

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:20.400
Yogini: Shri Mataji, please, could you talk about simpathy

00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:24.280
and compassion towards other Sahaja Yogis

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:28.240
who have problems, who have some negativity in them, please?

00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:31.440
Shri Mataji: I can’t hear. What’s it? Clearly, I didn’t hear.

00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:34.880
You also didn’t hear, I’ve seen. Yogi: Shri Mataji? Shri Mataji: Ah.

00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:37.160
Yogi: Could You speak about sympathy and compassion

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:43.080
towards other Sahaja Yogis who have problems with negativity? Shri Mataji: Ah.

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:48.320
Now. Sympathy and compassion;

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:54.840
sympathy doesn’t get involved, then it’s compassion.

00:38:56.240 --> 00:39:00.760
Sympathy. ‘Sym’ means ‘share’, ‘pathy’ means ‘pathos’ –

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:03.680
if you want to share the pathos of another person

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:05.600
then you are sympathizing with that person.

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:11.240
Now supposing, somebody’s husband is dead and that person is crying a lot

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:16.840
and you also go and sit down and cry louder than her.

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:22.880
Then people will ask you, “Did you husband die or her husband die?”.

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:28.920
“No, no, I am just showing sympathy, you know”.

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:36.760
This is lip sympathy, of course. Another is – may be the heartfelt sympathy.

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:44.000
When it is heartfelt then you don’t cry;

00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:51.480
then you develop the opposite force

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:56.400
to put that person right. What do you say to that person?

00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:04.360
You should say, “See, now if you are born you are going to die,

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:08.440
everybody’s going to die, that’s, that’s the system.

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:12.480
Now, two persons never die together.

00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:18.120
This gentleman who has died now, he’s your husband, alright,

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:22.920
but now if you start crying like this, he won’t have any peace,

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:29.000
he’ll be hovering round you, and he might be in limbo

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:34.760
waiting for you to come there, or something like that.

00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:40.480
So no use crying over him, on the contrary, you should say, “I’m alright,

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:44.960
don’t worry about me, I’m alright,

00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:49.080
get your realisation as I have got it".

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:52.000
This is the opposite force that you put.

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:58.920
This is a real, real way of helping that person.

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:02.640
But the compassion is very different,

00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:08.440
compassion just flows, it doesn’t say anything.

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:17.920
Even you don’t see Me, even if you are in the hospital, you know I am with you.

00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:27.480
It works. Even if you just think of Me, it works.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.960
Even if you make some mistakes, you know Mother will forgive.

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:38.360
That’s compassion.

00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:42.440
Compassion is just flow, you don’t talk about it, you don’t say anything.

00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:47.760
It just flows and covers you completely.

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:53.080
And you enjoy that. That’s compassion;

00:41:54.240 --> 00:42:03.040
it works - sympathy doesn’t work - compassion works, it soothes you.

00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:16.520
It’s a very beautiful touch of love, affection, kindness, protection.

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:26.960
And you feel so confident that you are under the protection of the Divine.

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:38.560
So, this compassion has not to be shown or to be dealt with.

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:42.520
Now supposing, another Sahaja Yogi’s having a problem.

00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:44.960
We have only two problems;

00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:50.240
as I say, “How many turns there are in London? Only two, left or right”.

00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:55.000
In the same way, they have two problems: either left or right.

00:42:55.560 --> 00:43:00.640
If it is the left one or the right one.

00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:03.880
You know right one you have to beat with the shoes, that’s all, finished.

00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:10.120
You don’t have to go and say anything to the person, if he has right problems.

00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:16.760
Now if he has the left problem what do you do?

00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:21.840
You need not go and talk to that person: give him a bandhan,

00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:24.400
you can burn the name, you can do what you like.

00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:29.240
But you need not face the person, you need not tell the person that, “I’m helping you,

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:33.120
I’m trying to do something for you”. That’s wrong, that’s ignorance,

00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:40.440
you don’t have to say that; it just works, it has to work by itself.

00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:43.440
But I don’t tell you that I’m going to help you in any way, do I?

00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:54.280
Nothing of the kind. Wherever you are you know I’m with you, all the time.

00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:59.200
In the same way, this compassion will work whether you are sitting down here,

00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:04.040
if you are beating somebody with shoes that person will come round.

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:09.640
So they have only two problems, one is the left or the right.

00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:15.840
If you try to sympathize with any one of them you are in trouble.

00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:23.600
So best thing is not to directly help them, but indirectly.

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:31.200
Not to tell them that you are helping, not even mention it to them;

00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:38.560
the concern is the point, the concern about a person.

00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:42.640
Your attention should go there, your attention is very active.

00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:47.320
It’s a very powerful thing you have got, your attention acts.

00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:51.560
Just put your attention to that person, with a concern,

00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:57.480
but no involvement: that is compassion.

00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:01.240
You have got it, you have got the power of compassion

00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:06.720
in your attention now, you haven’t used it.

00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:13.760
Without taking any credit for it, without showing it, without confronting it,

00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:19.640
just inside yourself you feel it, it will work out.

00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:25.200
But for that you have to cleanse your own attention, that’s very important.

00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:30.880
If your attention is loose type, if your connection is not alright,

00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:37.560
then it won’t work out. But if you have that kind of an attention

00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:48.120
which is silent, which is witnessing, which is not involved, it’s dynamic, it works!

00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:55.240
All of you have to become like Me, I’m sure you all can,

00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:59.640
and achieve that calibre of compassion.

00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:06.600
Alright? Do you follow now? Thank you.

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:22.280
Any other question, Hester? No?

00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:32.920
Danya has any questions? You never had them.

00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:40.560
Anybody else? Jason? None!

00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:45.680
Question-less people, I tell you.

00:46:53.800 --> 00:47:01.560
Best way is to enjoy others. Best way is to enjoy others;

00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:08.080
and to enjoy yourself is to laugh at yourself, that’s the best way.

00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:13.760
Address yourself, “You, Mister, now come along, this is ego, I know.

00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:19.920
Ah, that’s it, that’s the one! No no no no no no no no no, not me!

00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:23.040
I’ve had enough of it”.

00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:27.440
That’s how you enjoy yourself.

00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:33.120
And enjoy others, seeing their good points.

00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:40.200
Sweet, sweet things they do, very sweet things. You don’t have to say anything.

00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:43.920
And we had 71 marriages, you can’t believe it.

00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:48.600
And I looked at the brides and they were all looking at Me from the angles, you see;

00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:55.160
and the eyes were telling the story of their love and gratitude,

00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:58.640
and I don’t know what all they said.

00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:02.160
I was just watching them when they were walking

00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:05.800
with their garlands in their hands, slowly, slowly;

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:15.080
the sweetness, the beauty of their feelings; very slowly they were walking.

00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:23.880
And then I saw the boys standing there, looking at Me

00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:29.880
with tremendous feeling of oneness.

00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:35.040
You see, this cannot be enjoyed otherwise.

00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:38.680
Even with the body you cannot enjoy, supposing you rub your hand,

00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:48.600
you won’t enjoy that much as you enjoy other people, other sahaja yogis.

00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:56.040
And then the friends doing the leg-pulling also I enjoy,

00:48:56.440 --> 00:49:01.280
the way they talk to each other I enjoy, everything’s so enjoyable,

00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:06.280
it doesn’t hurt anyone, it doesn’t trouble anyone.

00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:13.960
You are here to enjoy, God has created this universe for you to enjoy.

00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:18.720
So only thing is that you must improve your attention,

00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:22.960
cleanse your attention by meditation,

00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:29.480
always think of good things, not of bad things.

00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:34.320
You should not react too much, just be within yourself,

00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:37.520
see for yourself, witness everything.

00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:43.960
And you’ll be amazed, you’ll see beautiful points, beautiful things all around you.

00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:52.320
So much of beauty which we are losing because we cannot see it.

00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:57.440
So that deep, penetrating attention of concern

00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:01.240
will solve all the problems, I’m sure.

00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:07.760
But ‘open your heart’ doesn’t mean that you go and hug somebody

00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:10.480
and kiss somebody ten times, it doesn’t mean that at all.

00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:15.000
On the contrary, it can be quite embarrassing, you know?

00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:23.480
Any other questions?

00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:42.040
I, I had a problem there, you see, we, they arranged a programme for Me

00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:46.000
to speak to the young presidents’ organisation,

00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:51.720
the presidents of big, big – of big, big organisations,

00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:55.560
business organisations, and I had to speak to them.

00:50:55.760 --> 00:51:00.000
And one of the lady - of course, I mean - the questions were

00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:02.880
very good and everything flowing (?) over, and later on she says,

00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:07.920
“But I can’t believe it, because she is not at all serious, you see”.

00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:11.760
And I laughed and laughed and laughed with that, I said,

00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:16.240
“Now I cannot be serious anymore, that was too much”.

00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:20.760
When there’s so much joy bubbling out, why, how can you be serious?

00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:25.720
This is the idea of a saint that he should be very serious, stern,

00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:33.160
going out with a stick in his hand all the time hitting everyone on the head.

00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:41.320
So, any other question (indistinct word)? No.

00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:48.480
We must have a hall here, big hall

00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:53.840
we should buy somewhere, we should be able to buy.

00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:57.280
I’m thankful to people who are working on Shudy Camp but I think

00:51:57.480 --> 00:51:59.800
you must hurry up now,

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:04.120
people are coming for Guru Puja, I told them we’ll have it in Shudy Camp.

00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:07.280
And otherwise if it is not ready we’ll have to change the venue,

00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:11.080
so everybody must go and work it out, I think, is important.

00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:15.120
We have money, we have no problem on that.

00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:20.600
We have to have a nice, grand, beautiful

00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:26.040
seminar before Guru Puja. And there are many coming here,

00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:33.440
you’ll meet all of them, will be a very nice time, real festival we’ll be having.

00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:38.480
So it would be better that you, all of you combine together and work it out

00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:44.160
and also give different work to different people;

00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:50.720
and they should all try to organize it in a beautiful way

00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:54.720
that there’s no quarrel, nothing. But you’ll see people, you see, will say,

00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:59.720
“Oh! This is the room I would like to have for my wife”, things like that.

00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:02.920
Sounds stupidity.

00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:08.680
“This is the glass for me, I can’t give it to you”.

00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:13.520
All such stupid things will be there, and I think, for such people you should say,

00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:17.840
“You are not for Guru Puja, better not be here”.

00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:22.440
Everybody doesn’t deserve to be there.

00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:26.560
That’s you should find out, that what sort of people they are.

00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:29.920
If they are fighting for all these little, little things it’s best is to tell them

00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:34.440
that, “Sorry, you’d better not come for Guru Puja”.

00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:44.480
So, the most important thing is that in Guru Puja we have to receive

00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:50.000
a special capacity to be a guru ourselves.

00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:54.600
A special intelligence, a special understanding,

00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:58.600
a kind of a wisdom which gives you discretion

00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:02.600
and the ability to argue out things.

00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:07.160
That will enhance your personality,

00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:17.320
a beautiful, dignified personality can be created within yourselves,

00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:21.560
so for that you have to be there

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:27.560
with all that dedication and understanding about yourself.

00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:33.560
So I’m looking forward to this Guru Puja, and everybody has to write.

00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:39.000
Now for Sahastrara day they are working so hard, the people from Australia

00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:42.800
have printed so many posters, all over the world they have sent it,

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:46.680
they have sent it to you also the posters of Sahastrar Day - have you brought it?

00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:50.080
No? You haven’t shown them.

00:54:57.880 --> 00:55:00.760
So next time you must show all of them, they should see that,

00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:04.320
what they have done, how much; and you must -

00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:07.680
we have no, nothing like a news from there and this thing - but all this

00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:10.680
can be discussed among yourself; and you should know about each other,

00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:13.960
what’s happening, where, and what ashram is doing,

00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:20.160
what is the special work they are doing, and what is the new thing they have discovered;

00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:25.800
all sorts of things you can find out from each other. And you can tell others also.

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:30.280
This is how you keep in communication with each other.

00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:34.480
Oh, there’s a very good news, that Doctor Rai,

00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:40.160
who is the Dean of the Faculty of Physiology in Delhi University,

00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:46.440
started a research work on the comparative study of Sahaja Yogis and others

00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:50.480
as far as the physiology is concerned. And he’s found out that the people

00:55:50.680 --> 00:56:00.920
who are not Sahaja Yogis have a very low resistance for diseases,

00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:04.680
their skin, skin resistance is less and so many things he’s found out.

00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:08.320
And he has put it on, he’s tabulated the whole thing,

00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:13.040
and that is been now approved by the Government and is now published,

00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:16.840
going to be published also. In the same way, you see,

00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:21.960
we are thinking of having a research here done for people in Shudy Camp,

00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:25.240
so that we can also publish something like that with the research.

00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:28.760
That so far, you see, so many have been cured, so many got rid

00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:32.880
of their addictions, so many got rid of their mental problems,

00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:36.320
so many things happened; but we haven’t yet recorded it,

00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:40.520
we have not put it properly on the record. Now this is what we are going to do now,

00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:44.480
anybody who has achieved something or has felt better

00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:47.040
or has been cured or something like that

00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:50.480
must give it in writing to these people so they record it,

00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:55.840
because, you see, in these modern times they want everything in black and white,

00:56:56.040 --> 00:56:59.040
so that could be done very well here in England.

00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:01.800
Another thing I was thinking that now “Nirmala Yoga”

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:06.720
has stopped there because of this problem of foreign exchange.

00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:12.280
So what we can do is to have a “Nirmala Yog” published in India

00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:16.960
and sent here, and you can print it here and sell it here,

00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:19.360
so that the foreign exchange problem doesn’t come in.

00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:21.760
Because foreign exchange is such a problem in that country,

00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:27.640
you have to have a proper committee, this, that, all headaches.

00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:31.920
So you can sell them here and distribute them here,

00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:36.160
it’s very easy, and Paul can help you there. Paul, can’t you? (Paul: Yes...)

00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:40.680
Yes. So it’s alright. We get the “Nirmala Yog” done there

00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:43.840
and just the copy sent here, translated.

00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:46.960
You can also add to it, you can also put something into it

00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:49.400
and some things from there and some things from here;

00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:56.080
you can distribute it to all the centres here and we can start like that.

00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:59.880
Because they created a big problem out of that last “Nirmala Yoga”,

00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:03.720
I’ve just stopped it, because you see we, we are not very good

00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:08.400
at human laws, I think, sometimes you make mistakes and I don’t want

00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:12.840
you people to be caught up into these human laws. So you have to be careful.

00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:17.760
And we can do it, I think we can do it. And as England is the heart

00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:21.280
it has to circulate everything.

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:29.240
But the hearts must open out. The conditioning is very bad here,

00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:34.040
you see, that you are told that you should not express your feelings,

00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:37.560
you should not say anything, you should be very poised,

00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:42.440
you should not talk about your feelings. That’s not so in Sahaja Yoga.

00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:46.560
This is the heart and heart must speak, heart must say;

00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:51.840
you must know how to say that you love others. It’s very easy to say ‘I hate’,

00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:58.280
but it’s very difficult for people to say ‘I love you’. Because they are afraid,

00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:01.560
that if you commit like this, “Oh, so you love me?

00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:06.320
So do this for me. You love me? So do this for me.

00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:09.720
How dare you say you love me, if you have loved me

00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:13.920
you must do all this and you must give this to me”.

00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:18.360
Oh, we had some Sahaja Yogis like that.

00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:21.160
They were abusing Me also that, “You said you love us,

00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:24.680
then why don’t You do this for us?”.

00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:28.640
Then it becomes a demanding love.

00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:34.600
Any other question anywhere?

00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:41.880
What’s happening, John, about your priesthood?

00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:48.560
They are getting quite exposed. (John: Yes, Mother.)

00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:52.120
Exposure is the only way, but still nothing goes into the heads of the people,

00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:54.560
they are so egoistical, nobody wants to accept

00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:58.200
that it’s all exposed now within – ‘No, it is fanaticism, it is nonsense’.

00:59:58.400 --> 01:00:01.880
But still they go on with it, what to do?

01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:32.680
Beautiful children you have here.

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:36.880
How many are new people who are seeing Me for the first time?

01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:42.080
Raise your hands please. Ah!

01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:48.240
Ah, you all look little serious!

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:57.000
Still rather serious. You shouldn’t be serious at all. Good. Nice.

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:14.080
Get the children. He is just hitting the head.

01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:25.440
Who is the child crying there so much? Whose child?

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:32.160
(A yogi says something inaudible) This child? What’s the matter?

01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:37.520
Must be hot. Take out the sweater. Eh?

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:46.520
(Somebody says something) It’s alright.

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:56.720
I think, must be hot for the child. And they feel very thirsty also,

01:01:56.920 --> 01:02:01.960
you see, these are places where you don’t have any humidity much,

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:06.600
so they feel very thirsty also in such places, I think.

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:22.520
All of them cry the same, whether they are Indians, English, anything!

01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:28.800
From their crying you can’t make out what race they come from.

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:39.480
Now better? Have you got some water or something?

01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:45.480
See! You must understand your children, they won’t cry without a reason.

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:49.040
They are all realised souls.

01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:07.360
Alright. Thank you, thank you very much.

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:13.040
Anything else?

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:24.400
(Someone asks an inaudible question.)

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:26.680
Shri Mataji: Can you say…? Yogi: How can you best cope

01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:30.080
if you have to work in a negative situation? Shri Mataji: In your office?

01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:32.760
Yogi: Job, yes. Shri Mataji: Negativity in the office?

01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:37.880
Yogi: Yes, Shri Mataji. Shri Mataji: You see, all the negativity

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:44.720
have also, has also an aspect which I call is ridiculous and humorous;

01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:47.360
so anybody who is negative or anything

01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:50.480
you watch it, see for yourself, don’t get involved,

01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:56.880
just see which part it is, is it ridiculous or it is humorous.

01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:03.680
Then you won’t be serious about it.

01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:15.040
Sahaja Yogis have a sense of ridiculous,

01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:17.920
you see, they understand what is ridiculous is;

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:22.840
also they understand what is humorous or what is stupid.

01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:28.840
So just see that, it is stupid? Alright, let it be, doesn’t matter, what can you do?

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:35.280
These children are growing so fast, you know.

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:38.160
They’re so becoming all tall, girls and all that.

01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:41.800
I’m just trying to make them out one after another.
