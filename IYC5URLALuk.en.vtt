00:04:44.079 --> 00:04:57.409
Today, we are here to celebrate the birthday of Shri Jesus Christ.

00:04:58.357 --> 00:05:07.584
Jesus Christ's life was very short and He spent most of His time in India, in Kashmir.

00:05:14.004 --> 00:05:17.520
He went back just for last three years

00:05:17.933 --> 00:05:21.053
and people fixed Him to a cross.

00:05:28.733 --> 00:05:31.893
It was somewhat destined.

00:05:35.653 --> 00:05:37.733
To open Agnya chakra

00:05:37.933 --> 00:05:39.893
He had to offer this sacrifice.

00:05:41.493 --> 00:05:43.213
So in this way He

00:05:45.413 --> 00:05:47.333
set up Agnya chakra.

00:05:49.893 --> 00:05:51.293
Agnya chakra is very

00:05:54.133 --> 00:05:55.733
constricted

00:05:56.613 --> 00:05:57.693
small

00:06:00.413 --> 00:06:02.533
and not easily openable,

00:06:04.333 --> 00:06:05.893
because a human being

00:06:07.093 --> 00:06:08.733
got freedom

00:06:10.173 --> 00:06:12.253
that made him egoistic.

00:06:14.493 --> 00:06:16.013
This ego

00:06:16.573 --> 00:06:19.213
constricted his Agnya chakra.

00:06:23.333 --> 00:06:24.532
And from that

00:06:24.733 --> 00:06:27.586
constricted Agnya chakra

00:06:28.333 --> 00:06:30.515
it was necessary to take out ego.

00:06:32.293 --> 00:06:34.733
And to take out ego

00:06:36.173 --> 00:06:39.293
you have to control your (MAAN).

00:06:41.013 --> 00:06:43.693
But you do not take out your ego from your (MAAN).

00:06:45.373 --> 00:06:49.733
As soon as you will try to take out your ego from your (MAAN)

00:06:53.373 --> 00:06:55.493
the (MAAN) will go on increasing

00:06:55.693 --> 00:06:57.933
and the ego will go on increasing

00:06:59.173 --> 00:07:00.933
[ AHAAM  KAROTI  SAHA  AHAMKAR ]

00:07:02.013 --> 00:07:03.133
We do !

00:07:03.893 --> 00:07:08.173
It means that if we try to minimise our ego

00:07:10.373 --> 00:07:12.453
the ego will shoot up because

00:07:12.653 --> 00:07:15.293
we will try to do so with the help of ego only.

00:07:19.013 --> 00:07:20.693
Those who think

00:07:21.213 --> 00:07:22.733
that to our ego

00:07:24.693 --> 00:07:25.813
will suppress

00:07:27.093 --> 00:07:28.493
will eat less food

00:07:30.573 --> 00:07:31.973
worldwide violence

00:07:33.013 --> 00:07:33.773
one

00:07:34.133 --> 00:07:36.693
standing on one foot and some on their head.

00:07:39.693 --> 00:07:41.013
Every type of

00:07:41.333 --> 00:07:42.413
experiment

00:07:44.893 --> 00:07:47.933
people do to destroy their ego

00:07:50.173 --> 00:07:51.973
But it does not supress the ego.

00:07:52.573 --> 00:07:53.893
It shoots up.

00:07:54.813 --> 00:07:58.053
To fast, to do (JAP TAP)

00:07:59.653 --> 00:08:01.173
everything

00:08:02.133 --> 00:08:03.213
shoots up ego !

00:08:03.933 --> 00:08:05.493
[Havana] also gives rise to ego !

00:08:06.493 --> 00:08:09.573
Because Agni is right sided.

00:08:13.173 --> 00:08:14.773
Whatever

00:08:17.693 --> 00:08:22.493
karmakand we do, rituals  we perform gives rise to our ego.

00:08:31.053 --> 00:08:33.333
For the past thousands of years human beings

00:08:33.453 --> 00:08:35.973
have been doing the same type of karmakand.

00:08:37.453 --> 00:08:42.413
Everything inside out whatever has been taught, is he doing.

00:08:47.133 --> 00:08:50.173
This is why Sahajyoga is against karmakand.

00:08:52.173 --> 00:08:54.413
There is no need to do any karmakand.

00:08:59.773 --> 00:09:02.453
And to go to the extremes is all the more bad.

00:09:04.293 --> 00:09:05.373
As I said

00:09:06.013 --> 00:09:07.973
that to take away your ego

00:09:08.173 --> 00:09:12.093
you, in Marathi is called (JODE PATTI ) beat 'it' with shoes.

00:09:13.213 --> 00:09:16.253
So daily in the morning Sahajyogis

00:09:16.373 --> 00:09:19.613
move out in a line with shoes in their hands.

00:09:21.053 --> 00:09:23.893
O.k ! but if you have ego, then only

00:09:24.853 --> 00:09:27.613
Every one is going out with a shoe in his hand.

00:09:29.093 --> 00:09:30.093
All this

00:09:31.333 --> 00:09:34.133
karmakand  penetrated into Sahajyoga too.

00:09:36.053 --> 00:09:41.013
So much so, that from France a gentleman came

00:09:41.213 --> 00:09:45.373
from Vashi hospital and got this karmakand from there.

00:09:46.493 --> 00:09:48.733
It is for sick people.

00:09:49.133 --> 00:09:53.333
If you have this trouble, then you do this karmakand

00:09:53.773 --> 00:09:57.093
The karmakand of cancer are written in that.

00:09:59.133 --> 00:10:01.493
I said it is human being's nature

00:10:02.213 --> 00:10:06.533
to do karmakand because he thinks that he can do it

00:10:09.933 --> 00:10:12.368
because of my karmakand, work will be done

00:10:13.813 --> 00:10:15.812
and in this karmakand

00:10:16.013 --> 00:10:17.666
not only you

00:10:18.213 --> 00:10:19.860
in foreign country also

00:10:21.004 --> 00:10:24.004
many people go on doing karmakand of various types.

00:10:25.813 --> 00:10:26.893
For example

00:10:27.493 --> 00:10:30.173
will go to church once a year.

00:10:32.213 --> 00:10:33.293
Means today.

00:10:34.413 --> 00:10:37.093
After that they don't take even the name of God.

00:10:37.213 --> 00:10:39.533
After doing all the dirty jobs of world

00:10:39.813 --> 00:10:43.173
and go to Catholic  ( DHARAM) and make confession

00:10:45.133 --> 00:10:49.453
If you can see this foolishness, then will be a Sahajyogi.

00:10:50.253 --> 00:10:53.653
If you can understand that this wrong act

00:10:54.493 --> 00:10:56.333
What we have done is wrong

00:10:56.933 --> 00:10:59.133
and now onwards this act is not to be done.

00:10:59.893 --> 00:11:01.853
If you can understand this

00:11:02.573 --> 00:11:05.333
your brain will retain it

00:11:07.973 --> 00:11:08.973
Now,

00:11:09.813 --> 00:11:13.133
Karmakandis have got all the more qualities.

00:11:14.653 --> 00:11:18.493
One thing is that they are misers number one.

00:11:21.053 --> 00:11:23.133
If you talk to them about ten rupees

00:11:23.333 --> 00:11:25.893
they start jumping into the sky.

00:11:28.213 --> 00:11:30.653
That is called in Marathi, 'KODI CHUMBAK'

00:11:32.413 --> 00:11:34.973
One thing is that in Marathi there are such words

00:11:35.293 --> 00:11:37.373
That your ego will dissolve easily.

00:11:41.733 --> 00:11:43.053
For example somebody

00:11:43.253 --> 00:11:46.893
talked high of himself, i did this, i did that

00:11:48.333 --> 00:11:50.293
tell him in a low voice

00:11:52.613 --> 00:11:54.932
'You are climbing a chickpea tree'.

00:11:55.133 --> 00:11:57.033
A chickpea tree doesn't exist !

00:11:58.013 --> 00:12:00.933
[Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi]

00:12:01.413 --> 00:12:03.173
So he cools down.

00:12:03.853 --> 00:12:06.893
I did this, i did that, i

00:12:07.573 --> 00:12:09.933
Till this 'I' ness doesn't go

00:12:10.133 --> 00:12:13.893
till then our recognising Christ is wrong.

00:12:15.133 --> 00:12:16.813
But it is surprising

00:12:17.093 --> 00:12:20.613
that what is called ' Christian Nations' where there is christanity

00:12:21.013 --> 00:12:23.533
more than them egoistic I have not seen

00:12:24.533 --> 00:12:25.933
particularly English.

00:12:26.293 --> 00:12:27.293
American

00:12:27.733 --> 00:12:28.733
everybody

00:12:29.173 --> 00:12:31.413
is so much egoistic

00:12:31.853 --> 00:12:35.093
that can't understand these desciples of Christ.

00:12:37.013 --> 00:12:39.044
Now what is the remedy of this ego?

00:12:40.653 --> 00:12:41.997
that should be thought

00:12:42.973 --> 00:12:45.652
It's remedy was Jesus Christ

00:12:45.853 --> 00:12:47.893
and He has taught

00:12:48.093 --> 00:12:49.573
that now

00:12:51.933 --> 00:12:53.133
love everybody

00:12:55.653 --> 00:12:57.413
love your enemies too.

00:12:59.293 --> 00:13:01.853
It's remedy He said was 'Love'.

00:13:05.173 --> 00:13:07.173
and apart from 'Love'

00:13:07.773 --> 00:13:08.853
there is no remedy.

00:13:10.093 --> 00:13:11.293
But this 'Love'

00:13:15.013 --> 00:13:17.613
is the 'Love' of Param Chaitanya.

00:13:19.573 --> 00:13:23.693
He said clearly,'Seek yourself'.

00:13:24.933 --> 00:13:28.813
knock the door and the door will open !

00:13:31.173 --> 00:13:34.573
It doesn't mean that you go and knock the door.

00:13:36.213 --> 00:13:40.533
It means open the doors of your heart.

00:13:41.613 --> 00:13:43.733
A peson whose heart is small

00:13:44.853 --> 00:13:46.173
those who are misers

00:13:48.133 --> 00:13:51.573
that person can never be a Sahajyogi.

00:13:55.453 --> 00:13:59.813
And another thing which is very important

00:14:00.813 --> 00:14:03.253
if you get angry

00:14:04.453 --> 00:14:07.173
it means that you have too much ego.

00:14:10.693 --> 00:14:13.973
I have seen absolutely angry volatile people

00:14:16.213 --> 00:14:20.453
And they feel elated saying,'I am a very angry person'.

00:14:21.573 --> 00:14:23.533
Such people cannot be in Sahajyoga.

00:14:26.733 --> 00:14:31.613
Those who know to 'Love' and that too 'Pure Love'

00:14:33.293 --> 00:14:37.573
and that too such 'Love' where there is no expectation

00:14:38.213 --> 00:14:39.293
no desire

00:14:40.373 --> 00:14:43.533
those who completely know to love selflessly

00:14:44.053 --> 00:14:46.213
only they can be in Sahajyoga.

00:14:48.133 --> 00:14:50.813
Egoistic people do wrong acts.

00:14:51.533 --> 00:14:52.933
I am tired of them.

00:14:56.813 --> 00:14:59.209
They will start something on their own

00:15:00.893 --> 00:15:02.813
and they won't even tell me.

00:15:05.013 --> 00:15:06.613
and by doing so

00:15:07.013 --> 00:15:10.173
Today thousands of questions have risen

00:15:12.213 --> 00:15:14.653
Today it is worth saying that in Delhi

00:15:15.813 --> 00:15:17.733
once they

00:15:18.653 --> 00:15:21.533
on the day of some puja hurriedly told me

00:15:21.813 --> 00:15:24.452
that we are getting land only this much.

00:15:24.653 --> 00:15:26.213
How much did we charge ?

00:15:26.413 --> 00:15:30.733
How is that going to be ? How is the land ? Nothing !

00:15:31.053 --> 00:15:33.053
And no Sahajyogi told me.

00:15:35.053 --> 00:15:38.533
Because if tomorrow somebody says, 'Mataji has said so'

00:15:38.653 --> 00:15:41.133
leave that person.

00:15:43.693 --> 00:15:46.373
If I have to say something, I will tell myself.

00:15:47.213 --> 00:15:50.493
After that we had so many meetings, I didn't say anything.

00:15:50.653 --> 00:15:53.053
Now those who have given them money

00:15:53.813 --> 00:15:55.693
are holding their heads

00:15:57.493 --> 00:15:59.213
that they have been cheated !

00:16:00.093 --> 00:16:02.253
How to get back that money ?

00:16:02.653 --> 00:16:04.973
Without asking Me all the work

00:16:07.213 --> 00:16:09.053
Absolutely without asking Me.

00:16:09.213 --> 00:16:12.893
The land is so bad that they have received a notice

00:16:13.013 --> 00:16:17.333
that you cannot construct anything here. On the contrary you will be arrested

00:16:21.613 --> 00:16:24.893
Every Sahajyogi has right to tell Me

00:16:26.173 --> 00:16:27.253
and ask Me

00:16:28.053 --> 00:16:30.093
they made a society of their own

00:16:30.293 --> 00:16:31.533
and became mad

00:16:32.053 --> 00:16:34.053
that they are getting land

00:16:34.893 --> 00:16:36.413
It is such a bad land

00:16:38.093 --> 00:16:40.813
It is said that you cannot grow even a chicken

00:16:41.653 --> 00:16:45.413
Are the Sahajyogis even worst than chickens ?

00:16:50.213 --> 00:16:52.773
Now whatever has happened is foolishness !

00:16:53.013 --> 00:16:54.813
and for that I am not responsible.

00:16:56.693 --> 00:16:59.013
But you ask for your money back.

00:17:00.853 --> 00:17:02.813
It is none of My resposibility.

00:17:08.533 --> 00:17:10.733
Jesus Christ had said that

00:17:13.893 --> 00:17:15.093
those people

00:17:20.733 --> 00:17:22.333
make houses

00:17:23.573 --> 00:17:24.573
live in houses

00:17:25.293 --> 00:17:27.133
they should watch birds

00:17:29.613 --> 00:17:31.093
he makes his own (GHARONDA)

00:17:31.213 --> 00:17:35.933
with how much love they make a small one for their ownself

00:17:39.573 --> 00:17:41.773
and when they make their home

00:17:42.173 --> 00:17:45.573
they feel a great joy in constructing that home.

00:17:49.853 --> 00:17:52.893
He explained it in every way

00:17:53.093 --> 00:17:55.653
that you give up attatchment.

00:17:56.653 --> 00:17:57.533
This is my house.

00:17:58.813 --> 00:17:59.933
This is my land.

00:18:01.013 --> 00:18:02.373
They are my children.

00:18:03.893 --> 00:18:06.322
Even this much that it is my country.

00:18:08.573 --> 00:18:11.453
This attatchment should be given up.

00:18:11.813 --> 00:18:15.733
Then only you can be great.

00:18:18.853 --> 00:18:21.133
In the whole world you are

00:18:21.333 --> 00:18:22.853
brothers and sisters.

00:18:23.693 --> 00:18:27.413
It doesn't mean that you give up devotion to your country.

00:18:27.613 --> 00:18:28.693
Not at all !

00:18:28.813 --> 00:18:32.813
If you are not devoted to your country you can't do anything.

00:18:33.973 --> 00:18:36.925
Within you there should be devotion to country.

00:18:37.853 --> 00:18:41.692
But the same devotee to country becomes devoted to the world.

00:18:41.893 --> 00:18:43.933
If there is no devotion to one's country

00:18:44.053 --> 00:18:47.173
if there is no drop, how can there be a sea ?

00:18:48.413 --> 00:18:53.173
first of all whether there is devotion to country, is to be seen first of all.

00:18:53.293 --> 00:18:56.052
If you are working  against your country

00:18:56.253 --> 00:18:58.093
you are not devoted to it.

00:18:58.533 --> 00:18:59.613
Jesus Christ

00:19:00.133 --> 00:19:02.533
had no need to go back.

00:19:03.373 --> 00:19:04.773
He had said also

00:19:05.253 --> 00:19:07.453
That there live such people

00:19:07.893 --> 00:19:10.533
Those who have the desire of only (MAL) are (MALECH)

00:19:11.853 --> 00:19:15.253
But Shalivahana told Him, 'No ! No 1 you go'.

00:19:15.453 --> 00:19:18.133
' And teach them (NIRMAL TATTWAM) the principle of purity.

00:19:20.413 --> 00:19:24.293
He went there to teach 'Nirmal Tatwam' and they put an end to His life.

00:19:25.613 --> 00:19:27.413
It is mad people's country.

00:19:28.773 --> 00:19:30.453
He didn't need to learn anything.

00:19:31.493 --> 00:19:33.013
But had to teach something.

00:19:33.213 --> 00:19:34.933
That is why He went there.

00:19:35.333 --> 00:19:36.933
and for the same reason

00:19:39.253 --> 00:19:41.013
His end was this way.

00:19:42.053 --> 00:19:43.733
But 'Wiseness' and 'Forgiveness'

00:19:45.373 --> 00:19:49.093
'Forgiveness' is the only mantra which can open Agnya chakra.

00:19:49.333 --> 00:19:52.373
If against anyone you have

00:19:54.973 --> 00:19:57.693
any ill feeling

00:19:58.453 --> 00:20:00.213
against anyone

00:20:00.693 --> 00:20:01.813
anger

00:20:02.893 --> 00:20:03.813
or

00:20:04.653 --> 00:20:08.853
if there is a tendency to be violent against anyone

00:20:09.133 --> 00:20:11.053
your Agnya cannot be up to the mark.

00:20:13.133 --> 00:20:14.733
Whatever you have to do

00:20:14.933 --> 00:20:16.453
you have to do with love.

00:20:18.053 --> 00:20:21.693
Even if you have to say something to anyone you have to say

00:20:21.813 --> 00:20:24.373
so that his life becomes 'NIRMAL'.

00:20:25.253 --> 00:20:28.093
It doesn't mean that you spoil your children.

00:20:29.133 --> 00:20:30.293
To children

00:20:30.493 --> 00:20:32.733
you have to perfectly

00:20:36.173 --> 00:20:37.653
discipline

00:20:38.693 --> 00:20:41.333
If you cannot discipline children

00:20:41.613 --> 00:20:44.253
your children can never be good Sahajyogis.

00:20:46.613 --> 00:20:49.773
And for that you must be yourself disciplined.

00:20:52.213 --> 00:20:56.453
If you are not disciplined yourself you cannot discipline your children.

00:20:57.413 --> 00:21:02.133
About Jesus Christ's life very little was written.

00:21:02.573 --> 00:21:05.453
But He was so disciplined

00:21:06.573 --> 00:21:07.893
In this way

00:21:09.133 --> 00:21:10.213
tolerated

00:21:12.053 --> 00:21:13.773
and from His life He showed

00:21:14.853 --> 00:21:17.133
He didn't need to be married

00:21:18.653 --> 00:21:20.093
He didn't marry

00:21:20.453 --> 00:21:23.453
It doesn't mean that He was against marriage.

00:21:24.053 --> 00:21:27.773
People have such wrong notions

00:21:29.253 --> 00:21:30.453
And that is why

00:21:32.933 --> 00:21:34.813
they have self made notions

00:21:35.013 --> 00:21:38.533
the women who are called 'NUNS' were married to Jesus Christ

00:21:38.693 --> 00:21:40.013
He was Sakhshat Ganesha !

00:21:40.773 --> 00:21:42.533
How can anyone be married to Him ?

00:21:44.333 --> 00:21:45.413
Apart from that

00:21:46.213 --> 00:21:48.853
Men also no to marry

00:21:49.493 --> 00:21:52.533
such unnatural/ uncultural  concepts were taught.

00:21:53.693 --> 00:21:58.493
With that everyone can be kept under control

00:21:58.733 --> 00:22:01.733
but one cannot become Christian.

00:22:05.733 --> 00:22:06.773
like such

00:22:08.373 --> 00:22:10.373
[KRITRIM BANDHAN]

00:22:10.933 --> 00:22:13.173
to cover oneself

00:22:13.373 --> 00:22:16.133
today Chritian religion is losing its importance.

00:22:16.613 --> 00:22:18.093
They forgot Jesus !

00:22:18.813 --> 00:22:21.253
and created a religion out of their own

00:22:21.653 --> 00:22:23.653
and call it Christian religion.

00:22:35.213 --> 00:22:37.053
The Christian religion of today

00:22:37.813 --> 00:22:40.773
Looks like a blot on the name of Jesus !

00:22:41.813 --> 00:22:44.053
Because I was born in this religion

00:22:44.253 --> 00:22:47.053
I saw the ins and outs of this religion.

00:22:50.093 --> 00:22:52.813
The same is the case with Hindu religion.

00:22:54.133 --> 00:22:57.933
In Hindu religion you cannot be communal at all.

00:22:59.933 --> 00:23:04.733
Because your various gurus, real gurus

00:23:04.933 --> 00:23:09.253
like Datatreya etc., and Nathpanthies

00:23:09.773 --> 00:23:13.693
are your many incarnations

00:23:13.893 --> 00:23:17.013
and your Sayambus are many.

00:23:19.453 --> 00:23:23.133
You don't have one book. You have number of books.

00:23:23.493 --> 00:23:26.173
Only Jesus and Bible

00:23:26.853 --> 00:23:30.613
They can be fundamentalists.

00:23:31.213 --> 00:23:34.293
And they can be Yahudis also

00:23:36.453 --> 00:23:39.253
And all the three are related to each other.

00:23:39.893 --> 00:23:41.573
It is written in books.

00:23:42.213 --> 00:23:45.053
But a Hindu can never be communal.

00:23:45.893 --> 00:23:49.533
Because some have some guru and others a different guru.

00:23:50.533 --> 00:23:52.373
Some adore Mahalaxmi.

00:23:53.293 --> 00:23:55.133
Others  Renuka Devi.

00:23:56.093 --> 00:23:57.853
Some to Krishna.

00:24:00.973 --> 00:24:03.133
So, every person

00:24:04.773 --> 00:24:10.093
every family individually

00:24:13.373 --> 00:24:15.493
adore incarnation, books.

00:24:17.853 --> 00:24:20.133
As such there is no book

00:24:20.333 --> 00:24:23.413
which can be called as Holy Bible.

00:24:25.093 --> 00:24:27.133
So to all the religions

00:24:27.973 --> 00:24:33.093
a Hindu should pay respect.

00:24:33.973 --> 00:24:34.973
I have noticed

00:24:35.773 --> 00:24:38.733
The capacity of paying respect is maximum in Hindus.

00:24:40.373 --> 00:24:43.173
Once we were in a hotel, there was a Bible.

00:24:45.373 --> 00:24:49.013
They keep a Bible (IN THE ROOM) whether somebody reads or not.

00:24:49.173 --> 00:24:51.173
That Bible fell on the floor.

00:24:51.693 --> 00:24:55.333
There was one Hindu with us.

00:24:55.893 --> 00:25:01.293
He picked up The Bible, put It on his head and then on the table.

00:25:03.413 --> 00:25:05.853
They will never touch The Bible with their feet.

00:25:07.453 --> 00:25:09.533
The Christians will do so.

00:25:10.933 --> 00:25:12.533
A Hindu will never do so.

00:25:12.653 --> 00:25:16.133
To respect everybody is Hindu's Dharma.

00:25:16.973 --> 00:25:22.693
But those who have come out of it are very very strange.

00:25:24.653 --> 00:25:27.013
Those who are our politicians

00:25:27.213 --> 00:25:29.293
such people have taken birth.

00:25:30.653 --> 00:25:32.453
As mushrooms come out in monsoon

00:25:32.653 --> 00:25:34.333
same way some people have come out.

00:25:35.093 --> 00:25:36.813
But they are not Hindus.

00:25:40.133 --> 00:25:43.213
They don't know anything about their (DHARMA) religion.

00:25:43.893 --> 00:25:46.493
North Indians don't know it at all.

00:25:47.213 --> 00:25:48.293
And those

00:25:49.533 --> 00:25:51.213
who are South Indians

00:25:51.693 --> 00:25:53.813
they know that bramhins have to be given money

00:25:53.933 --> 00:25:56.813
here and there, have to do this and that (RITUALS).

00:25:56.933 --> 00:26:00.413
In this Maharashtra there is nothing else than karmakand.

00:26:01.133 --> 00:26:02.453
They are so karmakandi.

00:26:02.653 --> 00:26:04.493
In Maharashtra I have worked very hard.

00:26:04.813 --> 00:26:06.213
Everything was waste.

00:26:06.653 --> 00:26:08.973
Because they are very ritualistic  (KARMAKANDI).

00:26:09.093 --> 00:26:10.653
They cannot give it up.

00:26:10.773 --> 00:26:13.133
Here is the temple of Siddhi Vinayak.

00:26:13.573 --> 00:26:16.653
The Ganeshji that is there, I have awakened that.

00:26:17.333 --> 00:26:21.573
Now what do I see that there one mile long

00:26:23.653 --> 00:26:26.293
long lines one mile long

00:26:27.613 --> 00:26:29.293
are standing on Tuesday.

00:26:30.693 --> 00:26:32.333
Gneshji too must have slept.

00:26:35.333 --> 00:26:39.693
The ritualistic people of this type are in Maharashtra.

00:26:40.573 --> 00:26:43.933
Because of that Karmakand their temprament has become hot.

00:26:46.693 --> 00:26:48.253
And in North India also

00:26:49.053 --> 00:26:50.453
I have seen

00:26:50.653 --> 00:26:52.893
that some people are Karmakandi.

00:26:54.013 --> 00:26:56.053
And those who are Karmakandi

00:26:56.453 --> 00:26:59.053
they have lot of anger, are hot tempered.

00:27:01.093 --> 00:27:05.573
And those who are not in Karmakand are very cool.

00:27:06.733 --> 00:27:10.453
So the first thing is Stop ritualism

00:27:10.573 --> 00:27:12.733
but respect everything.

00:27:13.493 --> 00:27:16.293
Stopping ritualism doesn't mean to kick everything.

00:27:18.413 --> 00:27:22.853
This balancing was taught by Jesus Christ.

00:27:24.973 --> 00:27:28.173
Without this balance your Agnya Chakra cannot open.

00:27:29.893 --> 00:27:33.973
Everbody's respect

00:27:34.173 --> 00:27:41.733
and unnecessary

00:27:41.933 --> 00:27:46.493
ritualism, in which wrong people are growing.

00:27:49.933 --> 00:27:53.693
Now a day's false gurus

00:27:54.133 --> 00:27:56.613
They exist because of ritualism (KARMAKAND).

00:27:58.973 --> 00:28:02.613
They will say you give so much money, do this do that.

00:28:02.813 --> 00:28:05.173
Do Havana

00:28:06.253 --> 00:28:11.093
108 times daily read these names, those names

00:28:11.293 --> 00:28:14.013
giving you mantras, doing this that.

00:28:14.173 --> 00:28:18.373
These are Karmakandis and teach you Karmakand.

00:28:18.653 --> 00:28:22.133
Completely against which is Jesus Christ.

00:28:30.653 --> 00:28:35.013
Which He knew that by doing Karmakand

00:28:36.653 --> 00:28:38.653
a human being becomes egoistic.

00:28:39.773 --> 00:28:42.133
and to crack this ego,

00:28:42.733 --> 00:28:45.413
To Karmakand, He

00:28:48.293 --> 00:28:50.013
had totally forbidden.

00:28:57.573 --> 00:29:01.613
The same way, in the name of God

00:29:02.613 --> 00:29:05.733
anyone earning money was objectionable to Him.

00:29:07.573 --> 00:29:09.493
On the contrary reverse process started.

00:29:10.373 --> 00:29:12.733
Earn money and consume.

00:29:14.893 --> 00:29:16.613
They don't give up earning

00:29:16.813 --> 00:29:19.133
but (believe to) earn money and consume.

00:29:21.133 --> 00:29:22.973
It doesn't solve any problem.

00:29:25.093 --> 00:29:26.933
Today in Sahajyoga work

00:29:27.213 --> 00:29:28.653
We should remember

00:29:29.413 --> 00:29:33.733
how much money we paid for Sahajyoga work.

00:29:35.133 --> 00:29:37.093
How much money did we give?

00:29:39.173 --> 00:29:42.293
Jesus Christ had twelve  fish killers.

00:29:43.453 --> 00:29:44.573
Even they

00:29:47.093 --> 00:29:49.573
spread in the  whole world by working hard.

00:29:50.413 --> 00:29:52.773
Today you are so many disciples of mine.

00:29:53.813 --> 00:29:55.413
And if you want

00:29:55.613 --> 00:29:58.373
you can give realisation to so many people.

00:30:00.493 --> 00:30:03.493
Can introduce so many people to Sahajyoga.

00:30:04.133 --> 00:30:06.293
But the people should not be half baked.

00:30:06.733 --> 00:30:07.853
They should be deep.

00:30:09.093 --> 00:30:13.493
Unless they are deep, they cannot understand.

00:30:13.693 --> 00:30:17.453
And for that the greatest thing is

00:30:18.573 --> 00:30:20.653
that how much we love them.

00:30:21.453 --> 00:30:24.533
And how much love they give to others.

00:30:25.533 --> 00:30:27.573
Anyone who is a leader in Sahajyoga

00:30:27.773 --> 00:30:29.653
he should remember first of all

00:30:29.773 --> 00:30:34.533
that the teaching of Jesus Christ is to love everybody.

00:30:35.253 --> 00:30:37.133
Am i doing that ?

00:30:38.653 --> 00:30:40.453
I shower my anger over everyone.

00:30:41.133 --> 00:30:43.253
I keep everybody under control

00:30:46.293 --> 00:30:48.333
I express my anger with my eyes.

00:30:50.293 --> 00:30:51.733
This ego is

00:30:51.933 --> 00:30:53.253
very much

00:30:55.613 --> 00:30:57.533
not only against  Sahajyoga

00:30:57.893 --> 00:30:59.653
but his destructor

00:31:01.053 --> 00:31:02.933
Whosoever is egoistic

00:31:03.333 --> 00:31:07.893
should lessen it and replace it with love

00:31:08.453 --> 00:31:10.853
Life will be  a pleasure.

00:31:11.813 --> 00:31:13.373
Life will be beautiful !

00:31:14.533 --> 00:31:16.373
If you don't know how to love

00:31:16.573 --> 00:31:18.973
then for a few days you come out of Sahajyoga.

00:31:19.093 --> 00:31:21.813
First you open the doors of your heart.

00:31:24.373 --> 00:31:28.873
With that only With its Shakti only Sahajyoga will spread.

00:31:30.093 --> 00:31:32.532
The question is that those who spread Sahajyoga

00:31:32.733 --> 00:31:36.293
they have the Shakti of love less and the Shakti of anger more.

00:31:36.413 --> 00:31:37.730
It will never spread.

00:31:39.733 --> 00:31:44.053
With love it will spread And with anger it will minimise and diminish.

00:31:45.813 --> 00:31:51.053
The teaching of Jesus is necessary for us to understand.

00:31:53.613 --> 00:31:56.213
Sorry ! I had to talk in Hindi language

00:31:56.413 --> 00:31:59.293
because most of the people are here Indians

00:31:59.493 --> 00:32:01.693
Some of them are Marathis

00:32:01.893 --> 00:32:05.413
and others are from North India.

00:32:06.253 --> 00:32:09.373
I was telling them about Christ.

00:32:09.573 --> 00:32:11.573
What was His power ?

00:32:11.773 --> 00:32:14.253
His power was of 'Love'.

00:32:16.613 --> 00:32:19.573
And not of anger

00:32:21.933 --> 00:32:25.133
Because He is the one

00:32:25.333 --> 00:32:27.693
who has crossed

00:32:27.893 --> 00:32:33.453
the most difficult center of Agnya.

00:32:35.573 --> 00:32:37.613
Those people who have ego

00:32:38.973 --> 00:32:40.853
never realise they have ego

00:32:42.453 --> 00:32:43.653
With their ego they do

00:32:43.853 --> 00:32:46.293
all kinds of nonsensical things.

00:32:46.933 --> 00:32:48.173
Without asking Me

00:32:48.373 --> 00:32:50.853
they have done something in Delhi.

00:32:51.613 --> 00:32:52.533
Without asking me

00:32:52.733 --> 00:32:54.653
they have done something in Russia.

00:32:55.213 --> 00:32:57.573
And it is so destructive to Sahajyoga.

00:32:58.693 --> 00:33:00.173
that they don't realise

00:33:01.133 --> 00:33:03.133
what they have done is the crime

00:33:03.333 --> 00:33:06.733
which is punishable by all Divine laws.

00:33:11.253 --> 00:33:13.733
If you want to do anything you must

00:33:14.253 --> 00:33:15.733
tell me beforehand.

00:33:16.693 --> 00:33:18.213
You must consult Me

00:33:18.413 --> 00:33:19.893
you must talk to Me

00:33:20.013 --> 00:33:23.173
Because I know what is happening.

00:33:23.773 --> 00:33:27.293
You don't know if somebody wants to cheat you.

00:33:29.013 --> 00:33:32.533
Then how will you know if you were

00:33:33.573 --> 00:33:35.693
so sensitive you would find out

00:33:38.573 --> 00:33:40.093
You would have asked Me,

00:33:40.293 --> 00:33:42.293
'Mother what should we do ?'

00:33:43.973 --> 00:33:45.573
At least ask Me.

00:33:46.813 --> 00:33:49.893
This is the main thing missing among

00:33:50.613 --> 00:33:52.173
Sahajyogis now that

00:33:52.373 --> 00:33:55.573
we have a kind of a very subtle ego.

00:33:56.493 --> 00:33:58.133
If you make somebody a leader

00:33:58.453 --> 00:34:00.413
it is very dangerous sometimes.

00:34:00.533 --> 00:34:03.253
If the leader developes ego because of his wife,

00:34:04.573 --> 00:34:06.413
It is a very difficult thing.

00:34:06.533 --> 00:34:08.653
They can destroy Sahajyoga completely.

00:34:12.413 --> 00:34:13.813
Anything is possible.

00:34:15.253 --> 00:34:17.653
So before you do anything like that

00:34:17.973 --> 00:34:19.333
you have to consult (Me).

00:34:19.853 --> 00:34:21.013
I am still living

00:34:21.813 --> 00:34:22.693
and you can ask.

00:34:23.533 --> 00:34:26.413
You can write to Me, you can telephone too.

00:34:28.933 --> 00:34:30.573
At least I am there to tell you.

00:34:31.853 --> 00:34:33.893
But then you have to develop

00:34:34.213 --> 00:34:36.053
your balance and your love.

00:34:36.893 --> 00:34:39.933
That is only through this Param Chaitanya

00:34:40.573 --> 00:34:43.533
It is all pervading power of Divine Love.

00:34:44.053 --> 00:34:47.013
You can develop that discretion.

00:34:47.813 --> 00:34:48.613
special

00:34:49.093 --> 00:34:51.813
.....powers.

00:34:52.333 --> 00:34:54.333
Even if somebody telephones to Me

00:34:54.453 --> 00:34:57.413
immediately I know what is wrong with that person.

00:34:58.773 --> 00:35:01.013
I don't say that you can become like Me.

00:35:01.213 --> 00:35:04.493
But at least you have vibrations to see.

00:35:05.213 --> 00:35:07.333
Also see your own vibrations.

00:35:08.533 --> 00:35:09.653
How are you moving ?

00:35:10.413 --> 00:35:11.853
Put a paper on your hand

00:35:12.453 --> 00:35:15.693
and you will see it will start shaking before My photograph.

00:35:17.693 --> 00:35:18.773
With this ego

00:35:20.133 --> 00:35:21.373
you cannot go further

00:35:21.973 --> 00:35:23.533
Why did you come to sahajyoga ?

00:35:24.293 --> 00:35:26.453
You came here not to become

00:35:26.653 --> 00:35:27.733
some sort of a leader

00:35:28.213 --> 00:35:29.613
or some sort of a

00:35:31.373 --> 00:35:32.453
a king but

00:35:33.773 --> 00:35:35.373
you came here

00:35:35.733 --> 00:35:38.813
to become a great guru.

00:35:39.373 --> 00:35:41.653
As you ask Me Gurupad Dijiye.

00:35:43.253 --> 00:35:46.173
For that you have to have in Sahajyoga

00:35:46.493 --> 00:35:49.133
a complete humility

00:35:50.053 --> 00:35:51.733
natural humility

00:35:55.413 --> 00:35:57.093
natural balance.

00:35:57.613 --> 00:36:00.853
This is what Christ has taught us.

00:36:14.173 --> 00:36:15.293
At that time

00:36:18.213 --> 00:36:20.533
I don't think that people had that much ego.

00:36:21.573 --> 00:36:24.453
Ego is a modern present to you.

00:36:25.733 --> 00:36:27.853
People get ego out of anything.

00:36:30.133 --> 00:36:35.653
For example, I met one lady once and found her ego very bad.

00:36:36.173 --> 00:36:38.613
I said, ''What is the matter with her?''

00:36:38.893 --> 00:36:41.293
So, I asked My daughters ,''What does she do?''

00:36:41.573 --> 00:36:45.333
They said," Mummy She knows how to make dolls.''

00:36:46.253 --> 00:36:47.373
For that she had ego.

00:36:49.653 --> 00:36:50.533
What is so great

00:36:51.373 --> 00:36:52.893
than to be a good sahajyogi

00:36:53.293 --> 00:36:55.653
You may be the king, you may be anything.

00:36:55.813 --> 00:36:57.573
Now you see the Prime Ministers

00:36:57.773 --> 00:36:59.613
and all of them going to jail.

00:37:01.453 --> 00:37:03.253
What are they compared to you?

00:37:03.373 --> 00:37:04.573
They have no balance.

00:37:05.373 --> 00:37:06.493
They have no sense.

00:37:09.453 --> 00:37:11.653
What makes you a separate

00:37:13.013 --> 00:37:14.093
individuals

00:37:14.813 --> 00:37:16.653
higher people, because

00:37:17.653 --> 00:37:20.693
you have no ego.

00:37:24.213 --> 00:37:26.493
Now people try to remove their ego

00:37:27.973 --> 00:37:29.053
Their two types.....

00:37:30.733 --> 00:37:33.933
So they will go on beating themselves with shoes.

00:37:36.093 --> 00:37:39.773
All kinds of ritualistic things they do to remove their ego.

00:37:40.893 --> 00:37:43.173
But all this we do with our mind.

00:37:44.333 --> 00:37:47.413
Whatever you do with your mind will give you ego only.

00:37:50.773 --> 00:37:51.933
They become ascetic.

00:37:52.213 --> 00:37:54.493
They are the greatest egoist.

00:37:54.693 --> 00:37:57.773
I must say, Hitler was the greatest ascetic.

00:37:58.613 --> 00:38:00.973
With his asceticism he became Hitler.

00:38:01.173 --> 00:38:04.253
If you want to become Hitler, you become ascetic.

00:38:05.093 --> 00:38:07.613
In Sahajyoga you are not allowed at all

00:38:08.053 --> 00:38:09.173
all this asceticism.

00:38:15.973 --> 00:38:18.013
You have to be loving

00:38:18.653 --> 00:38:19.733
affectionate

00:38:20.213 --> 00:38:22.293
kind and disciplined.

00:38:24.173 --> 00:38:27.253
I must say this because when you are loving

00:38:27.733 --> 00:38:30.653
you go out of bounds sometimes

00:38:31.133 --> 00:38:33.532
because you have no discipline of sahajyoga.

00:38:33.733 --> 00:38:39.573
Loving doesn't mean that you become like a

00:38:41.053 --> 00:38:42.773
Romeo, Juliet,doesn't mean that.

00:38:45.093 --> 00:38:48.653
You must have your balance through your discipline.

00:38:49.693 --> 00:38:51.493
If you have no discipline

00:38:51.613 --> 00:38:54.933
you can never be a good Sahajyogi.

00:38:58.613 --> 00:39:00.373
From the life of Christ

00:39:01.093 --> 00:39:02.213
we have to learn

00:39:02.933 --> 00:39:04.093
these things

00:39:04.293 --> 00:39:07.573
that unless and until we have these things

00:39:07.813 --> 00:39:09.853
we cannot

00:39:12.733 --> 00:39:14.133
become good Sahajyogis.

00:39:15.573 --> 00:39:17.293
Firstly, ritualistic nature

00:39:19.973 --> 00:39:21.493
secondly, anger

00:39:22.573 --> 00:39:24.613
thirdly, miserliness.

00:39:26.453 --> 00:39:28.613
like

00:39:29.093 --> 00:39:30.253
if you

00:39:31.493 --> 00:39:32.733
go to England

00:39:33.053 --> 00:39:34.133
it is written there

00:39:34.253 --> 00:39:36.693
'save pounds by taking a taxi'

00:39:41.373 --> 00:39:42.493
this is what it is.

00:39:43.053 --> 00:39:44.133
Miserliness

00:39:44.373 --> 00:39:46.493
where can we save money,

00:39:47.013 --> 00:39:50.212
'Mother, can you give concession?'

00:39:50.413 --> 00:39:54.213
it is not a some sort of a business I am doing here.

00:39:56.853 --> 00:40:00.333
'If you make it half price, so many will come'.

00:40:03.373 --> 00:40:05.293
''I am not using your money''.

00:40:05.693 --> 00:40:09.700
I am using it for your buildings, all this I have got it

00:40:10.453 --> 00:40:13.093
of course My money also and your money.

00:40:14.173 --> 00:40:15.653
So many things I have done

00:40:16.373 --> 00:40:17.853
The whole of Vashi

00:40:18.533 --> 00:40:20.253
the whole of Ashram

00:40:22.173 --> 00:40:23.653
In Delhi two ashrams,

00:40:24.093 --> 00:40:25.653
then the whole of school

00:40:26.613 --> 00:40:27.533
and also

00:40:28.213 --> 00:40:30.333
land in Pune and other places.

00:40:31.213 --> 00:40:32.973
Now in Pune they want Me

00:40:33.093 --> 00:40:35.573
to pay the land, to pay for everything

00:40:35.733 --> 00:40:38.413
and Pune people are the known Maharashtrians

00:40:38.533 --> 00:40:39.653
to be great

00:40:40.293 --> 00:40:42.293
miserly, kanjoos people.

00:40:45.213 --> 00:40:47.133
Even for their own

00:40:47.773 --> 00:40:51.333
ashram, they would like Me to pay for everything.

00:40:52.173 --> 00:40:54.693
and they nicely go and sing bhajans nicely.

00:40:55.093 --> 00:40:58.133
See they are good musicians, that is what they are.

00:40:58.333 --> 00:41:00.733
Very very miserly people.

00:41:06.413 --> 00:41:08.333
Miserly people can never love.

00:41:08.453 --> 00:41:09.533
Tthey love money.

00:41:11.093 --> 00:41:13.293
Egoistical people can never love

00:41:13.413 --> 00:41:15.253
because they love power

00:41:15.693 --> 00:41:16.773
to control others.

00:41:20.493 --> 00:41:22.773
They think theey are doing for Sahajyoga.

00:41:23.373 --> 00:41:24.453
but not.

00:41:24.573 --> 00:41:28.173
Unless until you do something for yourself and ego

00:41:28.653 --> 00:41:30.613
no use working for Sahajyoga.

00:41:34.293 --> 00:41:35.453
Look at The Christ

00:41:36.253 --> 00:41:38.333
He took birth in a very humble

00:41:38.933 --> 00:41:40.053
abode.

00:41:41.813 --> 00:41:43.173
But He was the king.

00:41:45.213 --> 00:41:46.733
And He lived with the poor

00:41:50.653 --> 00:41:51.933
and tried to save them.

00:41:52.053 --> 00:41:53.253
He saved the lepers.

00:41:53.453 --> 00:41:55.453
He saved so many people, there were.

00:41:55.653 --> 00:41:59.653
Twenty one people were cured by Him.

00:41:59.853 --> 00:42:03.253
Now sahaj yoga I don't know, how many thousands have been cured.

00:42:07.453 --> 00:42:09.933
But what is important is if you are curing

00:42:10.293 --> 00:42:12.533
you know that you are not curing

00:42:12.653 --> 00:42:15.453
It is the Divine power that is curing.

00:42:17.733 --> 00:42:19.333
You are not doing anything

00:42:20.973 --> 00:42:22.653
It is best to be like that.

00:42:22.773 --> 00:42:25.093
I feel the same way that I am doing nothing

00:42:25.733 --> 00:42:26.853
and I am Nishkriya

00:42:27.693 --> 00:42:28.573
doing nothing.

00:42:29.853 --> 00:42:31.253
but I am not lazy.

00:42:35.053 --> 00:42:37.933
You should be active but all your activity

00:42:38.053 --> 00:42:41.493
should come from the Divine power of 'Love'

00:42:42.373 --> 00:42:45.413
First of all you must extend your hands for l'ove'.

00:42:46.213 --> 00:42:47.493
You extend your heart

00:42:47.613 --> 00:42:48.653
extend your money

00:42:48.773 --> 00:42:51.893
house, everything for 'Love'

00:42:54.053 --> 00:42:56.853
Now once your wife doesn't allow others to come in

00:42:56.973 --> 00:42:59.333
throw her out of the house, I don't mind.

00:43:02.253 --> 00:43:05.893
Teach her how to be kind and generous

00:43:06.053 --> 00:43:08.165
otherway round for the husband.

00:43:09.213 --> 00:43:10.560
It is very important

00:43:11.053 --> 00:43:15.813
you have to be generous. You have to be kind, you have to be loving

00:43:16.373 --> 00:43:17.961
and sweet to others.

00:43:19.293 --> 00:43:21.373
Christ only once went into temper

00:43:21.573 --> 00:43:23.333
which He had a right to do that

00:43:23.653 --> 00:43:24.773
when He saw people

00:43:25.133 --> 00:43:26.973
selling things in the temple.

00:43:28.493 --> 00:43:29.773
Samething we have here.

00:43:31.333 --> 00:43:35.293
And if you don't go and buy anything from them they will be lost.

00:43:36.973 --> 00:43:39.732
But you only go and buy things from them because

00:43:39.933 --> 00:43:41.812
you have a habit of shopping.

00:43:42.013 --> 00:43:44.853
Anywhere they people go, they must shop

00:43:45.613 --> 00:43:46.693
is a habit

00:43:47.973 --> 00:43:49.413
shopping they must do.

00:43:49.533 --> 00:43:51.293
They will not see the greenery

00:43:51.453 --> 00:43:53.253
the beauty of nature, nothing.

00:43:54.453 --> 00:43:58.093
When I went to so many countries,you see I had to

00:43:58.933 --> 00:44:00.293
with my husband

00:44:01.173 --> 00:44:03.133
I had to go

00:44:03.413 --> 00:44:06.293
and see beautiful places like museums.

00:44:06.933 --> 00:44:08.013
I never used to shop.

00:44:09.093 --> 00:44:12.772
But when I have so many children then I have to shop.

00:44:12.973 --> 00:44:14.679
So I would go for shops.

00:44:15.093 --> 00:44:16.893
But not the way that

00:44:17.013 --> 00:44:18.973
that every place is for shopping.

00:44:19.773 --> 00:44:21.293
What is there to shop here

00:44:21.573 --> 00:44:24.813
when you have come here for your spiritual growth.

00:44:26.493 --> 00:44:28.773
In Mecca, do they have any shops?

00:44:32.773 --> 00:44:34.573
This is the holier than holi.

00:44:35.813 --> 00:44:38.493
Why should go to the shops ? I can't understand.

00:44:38.613 --> 00:44:41.373
I have told them not to have shops

00:44:41.573 --> 00:44:44.893
but you people are the ones, who encourage.

00:44:46.213 --> 00:44:49.013
who encouraged them to make money out of us ?

00:44:51.653 --> 00:44:53.653
Nothing essential to buy there.

00:44:54.933 --> 00:44:58.813
Now you have come to the holy occassion.

00:44:59.173 --> 00:45:02.693
Here you have come for your worship.

00:45:05.533 --> 00:45:07.773
In our Mahalaxmi temple

00:45:07.973 --> 00:45:10.213
there are people who are selling

00:45:10.413 --> 00:45:13.013
garlands and things for ladies' hair.

00:45:13.613 --> 00:45:15.893
But they say it is for the Goddess.

00:45:16.333 --> 00:45:17.453
And they buy there.

00:45:18.013 --> 00:45:20.333
All the people who are coming stupidly

00:45:21.053 --> 00:45:23.333
and give it

00:45:23.813 --> 00:45:25.733
to the brahmin in the temple

00:45:26.133 --> 00:45:28.173
and the Brahmin sells it back

00:45:28.973 --> 00:45:30.093
at a lower price.

00:45:30.773 --> 00:45:33.293
And these garlands are

00:45:33.773 --> 00:45:36.053
I don't know how many times sold and bought

00:45:36.173 --> 00:45:38.253
and sold and bought because of the

00:45:38.453 --> 00:45:40.653
stupidity of the people who go there.

00:45:41.693 --> 00:45:43.213
If they have to take something

00:45:43.413 --> 00:45:45.200
they should buy it from outside,

00:45:46.253 --> 00:45:48.173
not at the place where you have come.

00:45:54.253 --> 00:45:57.693
As it is you went to Delhi, you could have bought it there.

00:45:59.253 --> 00:46:00.813
or you came to Bombay

00:46:01.013 --> 00:46:03.693
you could have bought there but not in this place.

00:46:04.013 --> 00:46:07.373
We cannot make this place Bombay or Delhi

00:46:07.693 --> 00:46:09.773
otherwise why should we come here.

00:46:11.133 --> 00:46:12.933
That is why christ took a hunter

00:46:15.093 --> 00:46:19.333
and beat them those who were selling things near the church.

00:46:22.133 --> 00:46:23.213
Now they don't have

00:46:23.893 --> 00:46:26.493
I have seen, near the church they don't have.

00:46:26.693 --> 00:46:28.053
They have outside.

00:46:30.653 --> 00:46:32.253
But they sell other things

00:46:32.813 --> 00:46:35.773
like catholic church sells

00:46:36.413 --> 00:46:38.893
a wine called Benedictine.

00:46:39.013 --> 00:46:40.093
Imagine !

00:46:41.613 --> 00:46:42.733
That is another story.

00:46:44.573 --> 00:46:45.653
Christ went

00:46:49.453 --> 00:46:50.533
for wedding

00:46:52.533 --> 00:46:54.853
and they had no wine.

00:46:55.373 --> 00:46:56.973
Now in the Hibru language

00:46:57.213 --> 00:46:58.373
wine

00:46:58.573 --> 00:47:00.093
means

00:47:00.493 --> 00:47:02.933
the juice of the grapes.

00:47:03.133 --> 00:47:04.653
It doesn't mean fermented.

00:47:06.933 --> 00:47:09.733
So He converted water into black wine.

00:47:11.213 --> 00:47:12.493
You cannot convert

00:47:13.653 --> 00:47:16.293
water instatantaneously

00:47:16.693 --> 00:47:18.253
into wine.

00:47:18.453 --> 00:47:20.853
Wine has to rot , has to smell

00:47:20.973 --> 00:47:23.413
The more it smells, the best it is.

00:47:25.413 --> 00:47:29.293
But they think that Christ said you must drink this thing.

00:47:31.973 --> 00:47:33.053
He never said that.

00:47:34.453 --> 00:47:38.293
He just converted it into wine.

00:47:38.653 --> 00:47:39.493
meaning

00:47:39.973 --> 00:47:40.733
the

00:47:40.933 --> 00:47:44.853
taste of the juice of grapes.

00:47:45.533 --> 00:47:46.653
Once I went

00:47:47.573 --> 00:47:48.853
to some television

00:47:49.453 --> 00:47:52.533
and there was a very nice man in Italy.

00:47:52.733 --> 00:47:56.733
He said ,''Mother you first give me realisation''.

00:47:57.333 --> 00:47:59.933
So I said ,''Get some Water''. I put My hand into it.

00:48:00.453 --> 00:48:01.413
" Now you drink it".

00:48:01.733 --> 00:48:04.653
He said ,"It is tasting like wine".

00:48:05.053 --> 00:48:07.173
I said,"This is what Christ did".

00:48:08.133 --> 00:48:09.653
He got his realisation.

00:48:09.973 --> 00:48:12.893
Instantaneously, you cannot make wine.

00:48:14.213 --> 00:48:17.653
But if somebody dies, they will drink.

00:48:18.493 --> 00:48:20.693
If somebody is born, they will drink.

00:48:21.253 --> 00:48:24.573
At any cost, without drinking they are not normal.

00:48:30.773 --> 00:48:33.572
But the people who got realisation are suddenly changed.

00:48:33.773 --> 00:48:36.253
They don't want to drink. They have stopped drinking.

00:48:36.373 --> 00:48:38.252
Their attention has become nice.

00:48:38.453 --> 00:48:40.133
The whole thing is changed.

00:48:40.613 --> 00:48:42.893
This is the transformation that has worked

00:48:44.093 --> 00:48:46.853
of which Christ has talked, Mohammed sahib has talked

00:48:47.213 --> 00:48:50.133
everybody has talked about this particular time

00:48:50.333 --> 00:48:52.933
when people will get transformed.

00:48:53.293 --> 00:48:55.533
But even after transformation

00:48:55.933 --> 00:48:59.213
you do not want to become what you have to be

00:49:01.133 --> 00:49:03.139
for which you have come here.

00:49:04.653 --> 00:49:05.973
You will be left behind.

00:49:06.693 --> 00:49:07.780
It is a big

00:49:16.693 --> 00:49:18.796
transformation is taking place.

00:49:20.133 --> 00:49:23.589
In that transformation also your rising is taking place.

00:49:24.213 --> 00:49:26.933
There is a big evolution going on

00:49:27.333 --> 00:49:30.173
and those who will not evolve properly

00:49:30.373 --> 00:49:31.693
will be left behind.

00:49:35.493 --> 00:49:39.173
As it is said that, it is the last judgement.

00:49:41.053 --> 00:49:42.664
And you will be judged.

00:49:42.933 --> 00:49:44.653
You will be left behind.

00:49:45.693 --> 00:49:48.653
You cannot adhere to people who are rising higher.

00:49:49.573 --> 00:49:51.573
With your weight you will fall down.

00:49:53.653 --> 00:49:55.293
So for you

00:49:56.893 --> 00:49:58.253
to understand Christ

00:49:58.493 --> 00:50:01.333
is all these qualities you must have.

00:50:02.213 --> 00:50:06.253
If you are hot tempered , alright , go and beat yourself with shoes.

00:50:07.013 --> 00:50:09.493
But if you are not, then you need not.

00:50:10.773 --> 00:50:12.133
You must know what you are.

00:50:12.253 --> 00:50:13.693
First of all introspect.

00:50:13.813 --> 00:50:16.093
Accordingly you should work it out.

00:50:16.293 --> 00:50:20.053
But this ritualism is not allwed in Sahajyoga all the time.

00:50:37.533 --> 00:50:40.253
I would love all my children.

00:50:41.973 --> 00:50:44.973
To be extremely loving and collective.

00:50:46.653 --> 00:50:50.893
Not to denounce anybody for no rhyme and reason

00:50:51.253 --> 00:50:53.693
and if you have to denounce, you should tell Me.

00:50:54.013 --> 00:50:55.853
I know what is what !

00:50:56.533 --> 00:50:59.893
Without asking Me, you should not measure up somebody

00:51:00.013 --> 00:51:01.653
and say i have measured somebody.

00:51:01.773 --> 00:51:03.996
With what ? what is your yardstick ?

00:51:06.413 --> 00:51:10.413
You yourself you are caught up in the web of ego.

00:51:12.533 --> 00:51:15.853
You cannot condemn anyone without telling Me.

00:51:16.613 --> 00:51:18.012
You have to tell me.

00:51:18.213 --> 00:51:21.133
Don't worry that this thing will disturb Me or anything

00:51:21.333 --> 00:51:22.892
but you should ask.

00:51:23.093 --> 00:51:24.772
I know about everyone.

00:51:24.973 --> 00:51:28.573
May be I have not mat that person but i can feel the vibrations.

00:51:31.173 --> 00:51:32.573
You can write to me.

00:51:33.157 --> 00:51:35.972
Many people just telephone, that is not the way.

00:51:36.173 --> 00:51:39.893
You must write to Me because I read each and every letter.

00:51:40.453 --> 00:51:44.772
But all nonsensical letters you should not write also to waste my time.

00:51:44.973 --> 00:51:50.053
.....like my father's mother's, mother, this thing

00:51:50.253 --> 00:51:55.293
is sick or is dead and her bhoot is moving about.

00:51:58.773 --> 00:52:01.573
All sorts of funny letters come to Me.

00:52:01.774 --> 00:52:04.853
What can I do for such people ? That is not important.

00:52:04.973 --> 00:52:07.733
All: "I need money, I have no money.

00:52:07.933 --> 00:52:12.933
I am depending on you for money. So please send me money."

00:52:15.453 --> 00:52:17.613
You can ask on my photograph.

00:52:19.453 --> 00:52:23.373
If you are a good Sahajyogi, you don't have to worry for money also.

00:52:26.173 --> 00:52:30.533
Or i have no child ,Mother what to do? Mother i want to have a child.

00:52:30.653 --> 00:52:33.962
Those who have child, ask them what do else they have to say.

00:52:35.813 --> 00:52:39.373
So many have got children after coming to Sahajyoga

00:52:39.493 --> 00:52:41.413
but you must deserve it.

00:52:46.653 --> 00:52:50.213
So many miracles have taken place.

00:52:50.413 --> 00:52:53.813
So many people have been cured no doubt.

00:52:54.973 --> 00:52:57.333
But that doesn't mean that you have done it.

00:52:59.093 --> 00:53:03.093
Don't get into the trap of ego.

00:53:05.893 --> 00:53:08.013
That is most dangerous.

00:53:08.773 --> 00:53:12.773
If you destroy sahajyoga, you are destroying yourself.

00:53:18.173 --> 00:53:21.573
So, today you all have to promise in your heart.

00:53:22.733 --> 00:53:24.653
Put your hands to your heart

00:53:25.053 --> 00:53:25.973
and to say

00:53:27.013 --> 00:53:29.253
''Mother, We love,

00:53:30.693 --> 00:53:33.093
We spread your Divine Love,

00:53:33.733 --> 00:53:35.853
encompass the whole world,

00:53:36.373 --> 00:53:38.613
give realisation to all the people.

00:53:39.373 --> 00:53:40.453
Will not shout,

00:53:41.613 --> 00:53:42.973
will not be angry,

00:53:43.373 --> 00:53:49.213
will not do the all kinds of rituals but just surrender.

00:53:50.253 --> 00:53:51.733
Surrender our ego

00:53:52.453 --> 00:53:53.373
surrender ego

00:53:53.773 --> 00:53:55.293
surrender your ego.

00:53:55.533 --> 00:53:57.693
All your problems can be solved.

00:53:58.093 --> 00:54:00.013
because, as long as, there is ego

00:54:00.333 --> 00:54:02.613
this divine power doesn't take over.

00:54:03.333 --> 00:54:04.453
You may do anything

00:54:04.853 --> 00:54:07.533
You are not connected. Your connection is missing.

00:54:08.773 --> 00:54:11.093
Christ is missing. He is no more.

00:54:13.493 --> 00:54:18.373
To establish Him first of all you must show how you love.

00:54:18.693 --> 00:54:21.213
That doesn't mean that you love your wife,

00:54:21.333 --> 00:54:23.693
love your children and love your house.

00:54:25.333 --> 00:54:27.453
You have to love everyone.

00:54:28.893 --> 00:54:31.613
Try to make everyone happy.

00:54:32.813 --> 00:54:34.213
That is why I like music

00:54:34.333 --> 00:54:37.453
because through music you can spread vibrations.

00:54:38.693 --> 00:54:41.613
Very good media of spreading vibrations

00:54:42.613 --> 00:54:44.372
of loving vibrations.

00:54:44.573 --> 00:54:48.653
But those who are musicians have to be loving people,

00:54:50.653 --> 00:54:51.970
not hot tempered

00:54:53.573 --> 00:54:54.978
not showing off

00:54:56.733 --> 00:54:59.493
not thinking too much of themselves.

00:55:00.933 --> 00:55:02.333
All these will work

00:55:03.093 --> 00:55:05.133
very well if you understand

00:55:05.333 --> 00:55:08.333
that this Divine power

00:55:08.533 --> 00:55:10.453
is so powerful.

00:55:12.413 --> 00:55:13.533
No doubt it is love,

00:55:14.333 --> 00:55:16.733
no doubt it is truth,

00:55:17.653 --> 00:55:19.333
and no doubt

00:55:21.013 --> 00:55:24.933
if you get out of it, you will be caught up by anything

00:55:25.133 --> 00:55:27.133
and you could be finished.

00:55:29.453 --> 00:55:31.733
It is a very very

00:55:32.933 --> 00:55:38.013
powerful, effective and absolutely conclusive

00:55:39.173 --> 00:55:41.493
power you have within yourself.

00:55:42.613 --> 00:55:45.413
And thanks to christ that crucified Himself

00:55:45.773 --> 00:55:48.173
sacrificed his body for our sake

00:55:48.453 --> 00:55:49.933
that our agnya is opened up.

00:55:50.133 --> 00:55:52.533
Otherwise I could not have done this Sahajyoga.

00:55:54.853 --> 00:55:56.493
But in this area

00:55:56.693 --> 00:55:59.933
we have Buddha, Christ and Mahavira.

00:56:02.373 --> 00:56:04.973
and they had to do tapasya, tapaha.

00:56:05.453 --> 00:56:06.373
They did it.

00:56:06.573 --> 00:56:10.133
You don't have to do now, they have done for you.

00:56:14.893 --> 00:56:17.333
Now see I saw the musicians yesterday.

00:56:17.533 --> 00:56:19.932
In two three months they have learnt so much,

00:56:20.133 --> 00:56:23.133
otherwise formerly  all the musicians I knew.

00:56:23.333 --> 00:56:24.693
For Indian music

00:56:25.573 --> 00:56:27.293
had to really starve.

00:56:27.893 --> 00:56:30.133
For months together they had to practice

00:56:30.333 --> 00:56:34.053
years together, they had to bow to their guru.

00:56:34.253 --> 00:56:36.213
That is all over now.

00:56:38.653 --> 00:56:40.813
because of this Param Chaitanya

00:56:41.013 --> 00:56:42.813
and your power

00:56:44.053 --> 00:56:46.413
to be one with the Divine.

00:56:46.613 --> 00:56:50.213
This Divine power can transform you completely

00:56:50.413 --> 00:56:52.093
to such an extent

00:56:52.293 --> 00:56:54.173
that anything that you want to do,

00:56:54.373 --> 00:56:56.133
you can do it in two, three months.

00:56:58.093 --> 00:57:00.253
In Pune when they were singing

00:57:00.733 --> 00:57:03.333
'foreigners' as we call them with respect.

00:57:03.533 --> 00:57:06.773
In India 'foreigners' means respect , not like other countries.

00:57:08.173 --> 00:57:09.373
So they were singing.

00:57:09.573 --> 00:57:13.253
They were some very great musicians (who) had come.

00:57:13.893 --> 00:57:17.213
They told  Me,"Mother, we put down our head to them."

00:57:17.613 --> 00:57:19.453
Because how could these people

00:57:19.653 --> 00:57:24.053
who don't know a word about Indian music have learnt it so well

00:57:24.173 --> 00:57:27.533
and the pronunciation of these Marathi languages were difficult.

00:57:27.733 --> 00:57:29.653
But they are so good at it

00:57:29.853 --> 00:57:31.493
is very surprising.

00:57:33.173 --> 00:57:37.053
Now all this has happened in your presence,

00:57:38.493 --> 00:57:39.613
in your presence.

00:57:40.933 --> 00:57:43.580
It is nice here, you have balloons here.

00:57:43.813 --> 00:57:45.773
to celebrate Christ's birthday.

00:57:45.893 --> 00:57:49.173
and all these balloons of your ego should be burst,

00:57:49.773 --> 00:57:50.893
should be finished.

00:57:53.013 --> 00:57:59.333
(clapping)

00:58:04.813 --> 00:58:07.933
I will be happy if you could learn Hindi language.

00:58:09.013 --> 00:58:11.813
But I know My English may not be so good

00:58:11.933 --> 00:58:14.933
but best is to learn hindi,

00:58:15.933 --> 00:58:17.853
if possible.

00:58:18.053 --> 00:58:22.373
Because there are already fourteen languages in India

00:58:23.333 --> 00:58:25.933
and so many languages in another country.

00:58:26.933 --> 00:58:30.092
Every country has a different type of English language.

00:58:30.293 --> 00:58:31.893
If you go to America,

00:58:32.013 --> 00:58:35.293
I don't understand their English for at least two, three days.

00:58:35.413 --> 00:58:36.933
Because they go on

00:58:37.133 --> 00:58:38.573
taking their

00:58:38.773 --> 00:58:40.573
....tongue

00:58:41.053 --> 00:58:44.533
and lips on one side, then on another side.

00:58:50.533 --> 00:58:53.693
English of the French is another point.

00:58:53.893 --> 00:58:55.973
So best is to learn Hindi.

00:58:56.173 --> 00:59:00.653
and that too a good Hindi, not Sanskritized.

00:59:00.773 --> 00:59:04.373
But as they say (Rozmara) i.e., day- to- day- Hindi because

00:59:04.733 --> 00:59:07.933
I feel better if you understand what I am saying.

00:59:08.053 --> 00:59:10.413
It is not difficult because you are all sahajyogis.

00:59:10.533 --> 00:59:13.693
You can learn Hindi in no time. I am not saying you learn Sanskrit.

00:59:13.813 --> 00:59:15.053
But Hindi is very easy.

00:59:15.173 --> 00:59:17.013
Try to. It is not My Mother tongue.

00:59:17.213 --> 00:59:19.693
I have never studied Hindi language, never.

00:59:20.133 --> 00:59:23.653
But you see it is a very easy language to learn.

00:59:24.413 --> 00:59:29.173
But as My father told Me ,"Never teach Hindi language

00:59:29.613 --> 00:59:31.093
to an English man."

00:59:33.733 --> 00:59:35.493
I said," Why this advise ?"

00:59:35.973 --> 00:59:38.452
He said," There was an English man who was after me

00:59:38.653 --> 00:59:40.799
that i should teach him Hindi."

00:59:41.413 --> 00:59:45.333
so he said," I have to tell my servant to open the door

00:59:46.933 --> 00:59:48.333
or to close the door.''

00:59:50.173 --> 00:59:52.893
So for open the door he said you say

00:59:53.653 --> 00:59:58.933
'there was a cool day', means 'Darwaza khol de'

01:00:04.173 --> 01:00:05.601
(clapping)

01:00:12.413 --> 01:00:16.693
And for closing the door, you have to say, 'There was a banker'

01:00:18.533 --> 01:00:22.013
"Maine darwaza bandh kar dey" (means close the door)

01:00:24.373 --> 01:00:26.053
But now it is different.

01:00:27.733 --> 01:00:30.613
They will pick up Hindi very quickly.

01:00:31.933 --> 01:00:33.653
Very quickly, I can see that.

01:00:33.853 --> 01:00:38.773
If you can learn this horrible Indian classical music

01:00:38.933 --> 01:00:42.693
which is so difficult, so easily, what will happen ?

01:00:43.573 --> 01:00:47.293
They can learn Hindi in no time and make Me happier every time.

01:00:47.493 --> 01:00:50.412
Not because Hindi is My language- It is not, it is Marathi.

01:00:50.613 --> 01:00:51.933
Marathi is very difficult.

01:00:52.053 --> 01:00:55.373
I don't think you can learn Marathi. It is very precise.

01:00:55.493 --> 01:00:57.760
I think that is one of the best languages

01:00:57.961 --> 01:01:00.253
to put down your ego.

01:01:02.124 --> 01:01:04.972
That is why Maharashtrians are normally not egoistical,

01:01:05.173 --> 01:01:08.493
because in their language it is built in process.

01:01:09.053 --> 01:01:11.413
For example somebody is boasting,

01:01:13.453 --> 01:01:15.693
that I have done this, I have done that.

01:01:16.013 --> 01:01:20.733
So in Marathi they will say, " Don't climb on a bush."

01:01:20.973 --> 01:01:25.933
or what we call the tree of channa which is so big as that.

01:01:27.773 --> 01:01:29.452
Then the person is finished.

01:01:29.653 --> 01:01:32.093
Like that there are many words by which

01:01:32.293 --> 01:01:35.373
you can put down the ego of the man on his face.

01:01:35.533 --> 01:01:38.933
So Marathi language has so many advantages.

01:01:39.173 --> 01:01:43.252
but I would not ask you to learn Marathi language. It is not so easy.

01:01:43.453 --> 01:01:47.733
But Hindi you should. It is very easy, very easy.

01:01:47.933 --> 01:01:51.973
but you must know one  thing that in Hindi language

01:01:52.773 --> 01:01:53.773
there is 'Adab'.

01:01:54.253 --> 01:01:58.053
'Adab' means modesty

01:01:58.253 --> 01:02:03.973
and respect

01:02:04.613 --> 01:02:09.293
respect, but more than respect it is a style of saying.

01:02:10.373 --> 01:02:13.973
Not ' Urdu ' but Hindi of day - to- day talking

01:02:14.293 --> 01:02:17.893
there is respect and a way to address others,

01:02:19.653 --> 01:02:20.973
to address others.

01:02:21.173 --> 01:02:22.093
All this

01:02:23.173 --> 01:02:24.293
will give you

01:02:25.213 --> 01:02:28.813
a kind of a more

01:02:30.213 --> 01:02:32.093
flexible vehichle

01:02:33.373 --> 01:02:35.013
to express your love.

01:02:36.213 --> 01:02:40.133
Because in Hindi language we can never translate 'I hate you'.

01:02:40.253 --> 01:02:41.413
We never say like that.

01:02:42.293 --> 01:02:43.293
I hate you.

01:02:44.093 --> 01:02:46.733
'I hate you' will anybody say like that ?

01:02:48.573 --> 01:02:49.853
We cannot say.

01:02:50.053 --> 01:02:52.293
To hate somebody is sinful.

01:02:53.693 --> 01:02:55.685
So they can never say,'I hate you.'

01:03:00.893 --> 01:03:03.293
Chastity is more in Marathi language

01:03:03.413 --> 01:03:04.653
but it is a little hard

01:03:04.813 --> 01:03:07.693
because it has got such as I told you

01:03:08.413 --> 01:03:13.213
......idioms which can correct you just there.

01:03:15.093 --> 01:03:21.333
All this is just to request now if you can learn this music,

01:03:22.333 --> 01:03:23.773
which is very difficult.

01:03:24.293 --> 01:03:27.173
You can always learn a simple Hindi language

01:03:27.933 --> 01:03:32.133
which is very very easy and very very easy to talk.

01:03:40.293 --> 01:03:44.213
There are so many things , I would like you to know about Christ

01:03:44.733 --> 01:03:45.733
But this is

01:03:46.533 --> 01:03:48.893
short time in which I cannot tell you.

01:03:50.733 --> 01:03:53.773
The way He had His own priorities.

01:03:58.333 --> 01:04:01.493
Though in the Bible He is not described fully, I should say

01:04:01.613 --> 01:04:05.493
and whatever it might have been they have reduced it.

01:04:06.333 --> 01:04:07.332
Maybe,

01:04:07.533 --> 01:04:10.653
and the way they practice Christianity is shocking.

01:04:11.333 --> 01:04:17.613
So one has to learn Christianity through the heart.

01:04:18.053 --> 01:04:19.053
No other way out.

01:04:20.733 --> 01:04:25.173
They should learn through the Heart, Heart of your Mother.

01:04:26.893 --> 01:04:28.253
May God bless you !
