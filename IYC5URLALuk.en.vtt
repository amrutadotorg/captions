WEBVTT

04:44.079 --> 04:57.409
Today, we are here to celebrate the birthday of Shri Jesus Christ.

04:58.357 --> 05:07.584
Jesus Christ's life was very short and He spent most of His time in India, in Kashmir.

05:14.004 --> 05:17.520
He went back just for last three years

05:17.933 --> 05:21.053
and people fixed Him to a cross.

05:28.733 --> 05:31.893
It was somewhat destined.

05:35.653 --> 05:37.733
To open Agnya chakra

05:37.933 --> 05:39.893
He had to offer this sacrifice.

05:41.493 --> 05:43.213
So in this way He

05:45.413 --> 05:47.333
set up Agnya chakra.

05:49.893 --> 05:51.293
Agnya chakra is very

05:54.133 --> 05:55.733
constricted

05:56.613 --> 05:57.693
small

06:00.413 --> 06:02.533
and not easily openable,

06:04.333 --> 06:05.893
because a human being

06:07.093 --> 06:08.733
got freedom

06:10.173 --> 06:12.253
that made him egoistic.

06:14.493 --> 06:16.013
This ego

06:16.573 --> 06:19.213
constricted his Agnya chakra.

06:23.333 --> 06:24.532
And from that

06:24.733 --> 06:27.586
constricted Agnya chakra

06:28.333 --> 06:30.515
it was necessary to take out ego.

06:32.293 --> 06:34.733
And to take out ego

06:36.173 --> 06:39.293
you have to control your (MAAN).

06:41.013 --> 06:43.693
But you do not take out your ego from your (MAAN).

06:45.373 --> 06:49.733
As soon as you will try to take out your ego from your (MAAN)

06:53.373 --> 06:55.493
the (MAAN) will go on increasing

06:55.693 --> 06:57.933
and the ego will go on increasing

06:59.173 --> 07:00.933
[ AHAAM  KAROTI  SAHA  AHAMKAR ]

07:02.013 --> 07:03.133
We do !

07:03.893 --> 07:08.173
It means that if we try to minimise our ego

07:10.373 --> 07:12.453
the ego will shoot up because

07:12.653 --> 07:15.293
we will try to do so with the help of ego only.

07:19.013 --> 07:20.693
Those who think

07:21.213 --> 07:22.733
that to our ego

07:24.693 --> 07:25.813
will suppress

07:27.093 --> 07:28.493
will eat less food

07:30.573 --> 07:31.973
worldwide violence

07:33.013 --> 07:33.773
one

07:34.133 --> 07:36.693
standing on one foot and some on their head.

07:39.693 --> 07:41.013
Every type of

07:41.333 --> 07:42.413
experiment

07:44.893 --> 07:47.933
people do to destroy their ego

07:50.173 --> 07:51.973
But it does not supress the ego.

07:52.573 --> 07:53.893
It shoots up.

07:54.813 --> 07:58.053
To fast, to do (JAP TAP)

07:59.653 --> 08:01.173
everything

08:02.133 --> 08:03.213
shoots up ego !

08:03.933 --> 08:05.493
[Havana] also gives rise to ego !

08:06.493 --> 08:09.573
Because Agni is right sided.

08:13.173 --> 08:14.773
Whatever

08:17.693 --> 08:22.493
karmakand we do, rituals  we perform gives rise to our ego.

08:31.053 --> 08:33.333
For the past thousands of years human beings

08:33.453 --> 08:35.973
have been doing the same type of karmakand.

08:37.453 --> 08:42.413
Everything inside out whatever has been taught, is he doing.

08:47.133 --> 08:50.173
This is why Sahajyoga is against karmakand.

08:52.173 --> 08:54.413
There is no need to do any karmakand.

08:59.773 --> 09:02.453
And to go to the extremes is all the more bad.

09:04.293 --> 09:05.373
As I said

09:06.013 --> 09:07.973
that to take away your ego

09:08.173 --> 09:12.093
you, in Marathi is called (JODE PATTI ) beat 'it' with shoes.

09:13.213 --> 09:16.253
So daily in the morning Sahajyogis

09:16.373 --> 09:19.613
move out in a line with shoes in their hands.

09:21.053 --> 09:23.893
O.k ! but if you have ego, then only

09:24.853 --> 09:27.613
Every one is going out with a shoe in his hand.

09:29.093 --> 09:30.093
All this

09:31.333 --> 09:34.133
karmakand  penetrated into Sahajyoga too.

09:36.053 --> 09:41.013
So much so, that from France a gentleman came

09:41.213 --> 09:45.373
from Vashi hospital and got this karmakand from there.

09:46.493 --> 09:48.733
It is for sick people.

09:49.133 --> 09:53.333
If you have this trouble, then you do this karmakand

09:53.773 --> 09:57.093
The karmakand of cancer are written in that.

09:59.133 --> 10:01.493
I said it is human being's nature

10:02.213 --> 10:06.533
to do karmakand because he thinks that he can do it

10:09.933 --> 10:12.368
because of my karmakand, work will be done

10:13.813 --> 10:15.812
and in this karmakand

10:16.013 --> 10:17.666
not only you

10:18.213 --> 10:19.860
in foreign country also

10:21.004 --> 10:24.004
many people go on doing karmakand of various types.

10:25.813 --> 10:26.893
For example

10:27.493 --> 10:30.173
will go to church once a year.

10:32.213 --> 10:33.293
Means today.

10:34.413 --> 10:37.093
After that they don't take even the name of God.

10:37.213 --> 10:39.533
After doing all the dirty jobs of world

10:39.813 --> 10:43.173
and go to Catholic  ( DHARAM) and make confession

10:45.133 --> 10:49.453
If you can see this foolishness, then will be a Sahajyogi.

10:50.253 --> 10:53.653
If you can understand that this wrong act

10:54.493 --> 10:56.333
What we have done is wrong

10:56.933 --> 10:59.133
and now onwards this act is not to be done.

10:59.893 --> 11:01.853
If you can understand this

11:02.573 --> 11:05.333
your brain will retain it

11:07.973 --> 11:08.973
Now,

11:09.813 --> 11:13.133
Karmakandis have got all the more qualities.

11:14.653 --> 11:18.493
One thing is that they are misers number one.

11:21.053 --> 11:23.133
If you talk to them about ten rupees

11:23.333 --> 11:25.893
they start jumping into the sky.

11:28.213 --> 11:30.653
That is called in Marathi, 'KODI CHUMBAK'

11:32.413 --> 11:34.973
One thing is that in Marathi there are such words

11:35.293 --> 11:37.373
That your ego will dissolve easily.

11:41.733 --> 11:43.053
For example somebody

11:43.253 --> 11:46.893
talked high of himself, i did this, i did that

11:48.333 --> 11:50.293
tell him in a low voice

11:52.613 --> 11:54.932
'You are climbing a chickpea tree'.

11:55.133 --> 11:57.033
A chickpea tree doesn't exist !

11:58.013 --> 12:00.933
[Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi]

12:01.413 --> 12:03.173
So he cools down.

12:03.853 --> 12:06.893
I did this, i did that, i

12:07.573 --> 12:09.933
Till this 'I' ness doesn't go

12:10.133 --> 12:13.893
till then our recognising Christ is wrong.

12:15.133 --> 12:16.813
But it is surprising

12:17.093 --> 12:20.613
that what is called ' Christian Nations' where there is christanity

12:21.013 --> 12:23.533
more than them egoistic I have not seen

12:24.533 --> 12:25.933
particularly English.

12:26.293 --> 12:27.293
American

12:27.733 --> 12:28.733
everybody

12:29.173 --> 12:31.413
is so much egoistic

12:31.853 --> 12:35.093
that can't understand these desciples of Christ.

12:37.013 --> 12:39.044
Now what is the remedy of this ego?

12:40.653 --> 12:41.997
that should be thought

12:42.973 --> 12:45.652
It's remedy was Jesus Christ

12:45.853 --> 12:47.893
and He has taught

12:48.093 --> 12:49.573
that now

12:51.933 --> 12:53.133
love everybody

12:55.653 --> 12:57.413
love your enemies too.

12:59.293 --> 13:01.853
It's remedy He said was 'Love'.

13:05.173 --> 13:07.173
and apart from 'Love'

13:07.773 --> 13:08.853
there is no remedy.

13:10.093 --> 13:11.293
But this 'Love'

13:15.013 --> 13:17.613
is the 'Love' of Param Chaitanya.

13:19.573 --> 13:23.693
He said clearly,'Seek yourself'.

13:24.933 --> 13:28.813
knock the door and the door will open !

13:31.173 --> 13:34.573
It doesn't mean that you go and knock the door.

13:36.213 --> 13:40.533
It means open the doors of your heart.

13:41.613 --> 13:43.733
A peson whose heart is small

13:44.853 --> 13:46.173
those who are misers

13:48.133 --> 13:51.573
that person can never be a Sahajyogi.

13:55.453 --> 13:59.813
And another thing which is very important

14:00.813 --> 14:03.253
if you get angry

14:04.453 --> 14:07.173
it means that you have too much ego.

14:10.693 --> 14:13.973
I have seen absolutely angry volatile people

14:16.213 --> 14:20.453
And they feel elated saying,'I am a very angry person'.

14:21.573 --> 14:23.533
Such people cannot be in Sahajyoga.

14:26.733 --> 14:31.613
Those who know to 'Love' and that too 'Pure Love'

14:33.293 --> 14:37.573
and that too such 'Love' where there is no expectation

14:38.213 --> 14:39.293
no desire

14:40.373 --> 14:43.533
those who completely know to love selflessly

14:44.053 --> 14:46.213
only they can be in Sahajyoga.

14:48.133 --> 14:50.813
Egoistic people do wrong acts.

14:51.533 --> 14:52.933
I am tired of them.

14:56.813 --> 14:59.209
They will start something on their own

15:00.893 --> 15:02.813
and they won't even tell me.

15:05.013 --> 15:06.613
and by doing so

15:07.013 --> 15:10.173
Today thousands of questions have risen

15:12.213 --> 15:14.653
Today it is worth saying that in Delhi

15:15.813 --> 15:17.733
once they

15:18.653 --> 15:21.533
on the day of some puja hurriedly told me

15:21.813 --> 15:24.452
that we are getting land only this much.

15:24.653 --> 15:26.213
How much did we charge ?

15:26.413 --> 15:30.733
How is that going to be ? How is the land ? Nothing !

15:31.053 --> 15:33.053
And no Sahajyogi told me.

15:35.053 --> 15:38.533
Because if tomorrow somebody says, 'Mataji has said so'

15:38.653 --> 15:41.133
leave that person.

15:43.693 --> 15:46.373
If I have to say something, I will tell myself.

15:47.213 --> 15:50.493
After that we had so many meetings, I didn't say anything.

15:50.653 --> 15:53.053
Now those who have given them money

15:53.813 --> 15:55.693
are holding their heads

15:57.493 --> 15:59.213
that they have been cheated !

16:00.093 --> 16:02.253
How to get back that money ?

16:02.653 --> 16:04.973
Without asking Me all the work

16:07.213 --> 16:09.053
Absolutely without asking Me.

16:09.213 --> 16:12.893
The land is so bad that they have received a notice

16:13.013 --> 16:17.333
that you cannot construct anything here. On the contrary you will be arrested

16:21.613 --> 16:24.893
Every Sahajyogi has right to tell Me

16:26.173 --> 16:27.253
and ask Me

16:28.053 --> 16:30.093
they made a society of their own

16:30.293 --> 16:31.533
and became mad

16:32.053 --> 16:34.053
that they are getting land

16:34.893 --> 16:36.413
It is such a bad land

16:38.093 --> 16:40.813
It is said that you cannot grow even a chicken

16:41.653 --> 16:45.413
Are the Sahajyogis even worst than chickens ?

16:50.213 --> 16:52.773
Now whatever has happened is foolishness !

16:53.013 --> 16:54.813
and for that I am not responsible.

16:56.693 --> 16:59.013
But you ask for your money back.

17:00.853 --> 17:02.813
It is none of My resposibility.

17:08.533 --> 17:10.733
Jesus Christ had said that

17:13.893 --> 17:15.093
those people

17:20.733 --> 17:22.333
make houses

17:23.573 --> 17:24.573
live in houses

17:25.293 --> 17:27.133
they should watch birds

17:29.613 --> 17:31.093
he makes his own (GHARONDA)

17:31.213 --> 17:35.933
with how much love they make a small one for their ownself

17:39.573 --> 17:41.773
and when they make their home

17:42.173 --> 17:45.573
they feel a great joy in constructing that home.

17:49.853 --> 17:52.893
He explained it in every way

17:53.093 --> 17:55.653
that you give up attatchment.

17:56.653 --> 17:57.533
This is my house.

17:58.813 --> 17:59.933
This is my land.

18:01.013 --> 18:02.373
They are my children.

18:03.893 --> 18:06.322
Even this much that it is my country.

18:08.573 --> 18:11.453
This attatchment should be given up.

18:11.813 --> 18:15.733
Then only you can be great.

18:18.853 --> 18:21.133
In the whole world you are

18:21.333 --> 18:22.853
brothers and sisters.

18:23.693 --> 18:27.413
It doesn't mean that you give up devotion to your country.

18:27.613 --> 18:28.693
Not at all !

18:28.813 --> 18:32.813
If you are not devoted to your country you can't do anything.

18:33.973 --> 18:36.925
Within you there should be devotion to country.

18:37.853 --> 18:41.692
But the same devotee to country becomes devoted to the world.

18:41.893 --> 18:43.933
If there is no devotion to one's country

18:44.053 --> 18:47.173
if there is no drop, how can there be a sea ?

18:48.413 --> 18:53.173
first of all whether there is devotion to country, is to be seen first of all.

18:53.293 --> 18:56.052
If you are working  against your country

18:56.253 --> 18:58.093
you are not devoted to it.

18:58.533 --> 18:59.613
Jesus Christ

19:00.133 --> 19:02.533
had no need to go back.

19:03.373 --> 19:04.773
He had said also

19:05.253 --> 19:07.453
That there live such people

19:07.893 --> 19:10.533
Those who have the desire of only (MAL) are (MALECH)

19:11.853 --> 19:15.253
But Shalivahana told Him, 'No ! No 1 you go'.

19:15.453 --> 19:18.133
' And teach them (NIRMAL TATTWAM) the principle of purity.

19:20.413 --> 19:24.293
He went there to teach 'Nirmal Tatwam' and they put an end to His life.

19:25.613 --> 19:27.413
It is mad people's country.

19:28.773 --> 19:30.453
He didn't need to learn anything.

19:31.493 --> 19:33.013
But had to teach something.

19:33.213 --> 19:34.933
That is why He went there.

19:35.333 --> 19:36.933
and for the same reason

19:39.253 --> 19:41.013
His end was this way.

19:42.053 --> 19:43.733
But 'Wiseness' and 'Forgiveness'

19:45.373 --> 19:49.093
'Forgiveness' is the only mantra which can open Agnya chakra.

19:49.333 --> 19:52.373
If against anyone you have

19:54.973 --> 19:57.693
any ill feeling

19:58.453 --> 20:00.213
against anyone

20:00.693 --> 20:01.813
anger

20:02.893 --> 20:03.813
or

20:04.653 --> 20:08.853
if there is a tendency to be violent against anyone

20:09.133 --> 20:11.053
your Agnya cannot be up to the mark.

20:13.133 --> 20:14.733
Whatever you have to do

20:14.933 --> 20:16.453
you have to do with love.

20:18.053 --> 20:21.693
Even if you have to say something to anyone you have to say

20:21.813 --> 20:24.373
so that his life becomes 'NIRMAL'.

20:25.253 --> 20:28.093
It doesn't mean that you spoil your children.

20:29.133 --> 20:30.293
To children

20:30.493 --> 20:32.733
you have to perfectly

20:36.173 --> 20:37.653
discipline

20:38.693 --> 20:41.333
If you cannot discipline children

20:41.613 --> 20:44.253
your children can never be good Sahajyogis.

20:46.613 --> 20:49.773
And for that you must be yourself disciplined.

20:52.213 --> 20:56.453
If you are not disciplined yourself you cannot discipline your children.

20:57.413 --> 21:02.133
About Jesus Christ's life very little was written.

21:02.573 --> 21:05.453
But He was so disciplined

21:06.573 --> 21:07.893
In this way

21:09.133 --> 21:10.213
tolerated

21:12.053 --> 21:13.773
and from His life He showed

21:14.853 --> 21:17.133
He didn't need to be married

21:18.653 --> 21:20.093
He didn't marry

21:20.453 --> 21:23.453
It doesn't mean that He was against marriage.

21:24.053 --> 21:27.773
People have such wrong notions

21:29.253 --> 21:30.453
And that is why

21:32.933 --> 21:34.813
they have self made notions

21:35.013 --> 21:38.533
the women who are called 'NUNS' were married to Jesus Christ

21:38.693 --> 21:40.013
He was Sakhshat Ganesha !

21:40.773 --> 21:42.533
How can anyone be married to Him ?

21:44.333 --> 21:45.413
Apart from that

21:46.213 --> 21:48.853
Men also no to marry

21:49.493 --> 21:52.533
such unnatural/ uncultural  concepts were taught.

21:53.693 --> 21:58.493
With that everyone can be kept under control

21:58.733 --> 22:01.733
but one cannot become Christian.

22:05.733 --> 22:06.773
like such

22:08.373 --> 22:10.373
[KRITRIM BANDHAN]

22:10.933 --> 22:13.173
to cover oneself

22:13.373 --> 22:16.133
today Chritian religion is losing its importance.

22:16.613 --> 22:18.093
They forgot Jesus !

22:18.813 --> 22:21.253
and created a religion out of their own

22:21.653 --> 22:23.653
and call it Christian religion.

22:35.213 --> 22:37.053
The Christian religion of today

22:37.813 --> 22:40.773
Looks like a blot on the name of Jesus !

22:41.813 --> 22:44.053
Because I was born in this religion

22:44.253 --> 22:47.053
I saw the ins and outs of this religion.

22:50.093 --> 22:52.813
The same is the case with Hindu religion.

22:54.133 --> 22:57.933
In Hindu religion you cannot be communal at all.

22:59.933 --> 23:04.733
Because your various gurus, real gurus

23:04.933 --> 23:09.253
like Datatreya etc., and Nathpanthies

23:09.773 --> 23:13.693
are your many incarnations

23:13.893 --> 23:17.013
and your Sayambus are many.

23:19.453 --> 23:23.133
You don't have one book. You have number of books.

23:23.493 --> 23:26.173
Only Jesus and Bible

23:26.853 --> 23:30.613
They can be fundamentalists.

23:31.213 --> 23:34.293
And they can be Yahudis also

23:36.453 --> 23:39.253
And all the three are related to each other.

23:39.893 --> 23:41.573
It is written in books.

23:42.213 --> 23:45.053
But a Hindu can never be communal.

23:45.893 --> 23:49.533
Because some have some guru and others a different guru.

23:50.533 --> 23:52.373
Some adore Mahalaxmi.

23:53.293 --> 23:55.133
Others  Renuka Devi.

23:56.093 --> 23:57.853
Some to Krishna.

24:00.973 --> 24:03.133
So, every person

24:04.773 --> 24:10.093
every family individually

24:13.373 --> 24:15.493
adore incarnation, books.

24:17.853 --> 24:20.133
As such there is no book

24:20.333 --> 24:23.413
which can be called as Holy Bible.

24:25.093 --> 24:27.133
So to all the religions

24:27.973 --> 24:33.093
a Hindu should pay respect.

24:33.973 --> 24:34.973
I have noticed

24:35.773 --> 24:38.733
The capacity of paying respect is maximum in Hindus.

24:40.373 --> 24:43.173
Once we were in a hotel, there was a Bible.

24:45.373 --> 24:49.013
They keep a Bible (IN THE ROOM) whether somebody reads or not.

24:49.173 --> 24:51.173
That Bible fell on the floor.

24:51.693 --> 24:55.333
There was one Hindu with us.

24:55.893 --> 25:01.293
He picked up The Bible, put It on his head and then on the table.

25:03.413 --> 25:05.853
They will never touch The Bible with their feet.

25:07.453 --> 25:09.533
The Christians will do so.

25:10.933 --> 25:12.533
A Hindu will never do so.

25:12.653 --> 25:16.133
To respect everybody is Hindu's Dharma.

25:16.973 --> 25:22.693
But those who have come out of it are very very strange.

25:24.653 --> 25:27.013
Those who are our politicians

25:27.213 --> 25:29.293
such people have taken birth.

25:30.653 --> 25:32.453
As mushrooms come out in monsoon

25:32.653 --> 25:34.333
same way some people have come out.

25:35.093 --> 25:36.813
But they are not Hindus.

25:40.133 --> 25:43.213
They don't know anything about their (DHARMA) religion.

25:43.893 --> 25:46.493
North Indians don't know it at all.

25:47.213 --> 25:48.293
And those

25:49.533 --> 25:51.213
who are South Indians

25:51.693 --> 25:53.813
they know that bramhins have to be given money

25:53.933 --> 25:56.813
here and there, have to do this and that (RITUALS).

25:56.933 --> 26:00.413
In this Maharashtra there is nothing else than karmakand.

26:01.133 --> 26:02.453
They are so karmakandi.

26:02.653 --> 26:04.493
In Maharashtra I have worked very hard.

26:04.813 --> 26:06.213
Everything was waste.

26:06.653 --> 26:08.973
Because they are very ritualistic  (KARMAKANDI).

26:09.093 --> 26:10.653
They cannot give it up.

26:10.773 --> 26:13.133
Here is the temple of Siddhi Vinayak.

26:13.573 --> 26:16.653
The Ganeshji that is there, I have awakened that.

26:17.333 --> 26:21.573
Now what do I see that there one mile long

26:23.653 --> 26:26.293
long lines one mile long

26:27.613 --> 26:29.293
are standing on Tuesday.

26:30.693 --> 26:32.333
Gneshji too must have slept.

26:35.333 --> 26:39.693
The ritualistic people of this type are in Maharashtra.

26:40.573 --> 26:43.933
Because of that Karmakand their temprament has become hot.

26:46.693 --> 26:48.253
And in North India also

26:49.053 --> 26:50.453
I have seen

26:50.653 --> 26:52.893
that some people are Karmakandi.

26:54.013 --> 26:56.053
And those who are Karmakandi

26:56.453 --> 26:59.053
they have lot of anger, are hot tempered.

27:01.093 --> 27:05.573
And those who are not in Karmakand are very cool.

27:06.733 --> 27:10.453
So the first thing is Stop ritualism

27:10.573 --> 27:12.733
but respect everything.

27:13.493 --> 27:16.293
Stopping ritualism doesn't mean to kick everything.

27:18.413 --> 27:22.853
This balancing was taught by Jesus Christ.

27:24.973 --> 27:28.173
Without this balance your Agnya Chakra cannot open.

27:29.893 --> 27:33.973
Everbody's respect

27:34.173 --> 27:41.733
and unnecessary

27:41.933 --> 27:46.493
ritualism, in which wrong people are growing.

27:49.933 --> 27:53.693
Now a day's false gurus

27:54.133 --> 27:56.613
They exist because of ritualism (KARMAKAND).

27:58.973 --> 28:02.613
They will say you give so much money, do this do that.

28:02.813 --> 28:05.173
Do Havana

28:06.253 --> 28:11.093
108 times daily read these names, those names

28:11.293 --> 28:14.013
giving you mantras, doing this that.

28:14.173 --> 28:18.373
These are Karmakandis and teach you Karmakand.

28:18.653 --> 28:22.133
Completely against which is Jesus Christ.

28:30.653 --> 28:35.013
Which He knew that by doing Karmakand

28:36.653 --> 28:38.653
a human being becomes egoistic.

28:39.773 --> 28:42.133
and to crack this ego,

28:42.733 --> 28:45.413
To Karmakand, He

28:48.293 --> 28:50.013
had totally forbidden.

28:57.573 --> 29:01.613
The same way, in the name of God

29:02.613 --> 29:05.733
anyone earning money was objectionable to Him.

29:07.573 --> 29:09.493
On the contrary reverse process started.

29:10.373 --> 29:12.733
Earn money and consume.

29:14.893 --> 29:16.613
They don't give up earning

29:16.813 --> 29:19.133
but (believe to) earn money and consume.

29:21.133 --> 29:22.973
It doesn't solve any problem.

29:25.093 --> 29:26.933
Today in Sahajyoga work

29:27.213 --> 29:28.653
We should remember

29:29.413 --> 29:33.733
how much money we paid for Sahajyoga work.

29:35.133 --> 29:37.093
How much money did we give?

29:39.173 --> 29:42.293
Jesus Christ had twelve  fish killers.

29:43.453 --> 29:44.573
Even they

29:47.093 --> 29:49.573
spread in the  whole world by working hard.

29:50.413 --> 29:52.773
Today you are so many disciples of mine.

29:53.813 --> 29:55.413
And if you want

29:55.613 --> 29:58.373
you can give realisation to so many people.

30:00.493 --> 30:03.493
Can introduce so many people to Sahajyoga.

30:04.133 --> 30:06.293
But the people should not be half baked.

30:06.733 --> 30:07.853
They should be deep.

30:09.093 --> 30:13.493
Unless they are deep, they cannot understand.

30:13.693 --> 30:17.453
And for that the greatest thing is

30:18.573 --> 30:20.653
that how much we love them.

30:21.453 --> 30:24.533
And how much love they give to others.

30:25.533 --> 30:27.573
Anyone who is a leader in Sahajyoga

30:27.773 --> 30:29.653
he should remember first of all

30:29.773 --> 30:34.533
that the teaching of Jesus Christ is to love everybody.

30:35.253 --> 30:37.133
Am i doing that ?

30:38.653 --> 30:40.453
I shower my anger over everyone.

30:41.133 --> 30:43.253
I keep everybody under control

30:46.293 --> 30:48.333
I express my anger with my eyes.

30:50.293 --> 30:51.733
This ego is

30:51.933 --> 30:53.253
very much

30:55.613 --> 30:57.533
not only against  Sahajyoga

30:57.893 --> 30:59.653
but his destructor

31:01.053 --> 31:02.933
Whosoever is egoistic

31:03.333 --> 31:07.893
should lessen it and replace it with love

31:08.453 --> 31:10.853
Life will be  a pleasure.

31:11.813 --> 31:13.373
Life will be beautiful !

31:14.533 --> 31:16.373
If you don't know how to love

31:16.573 --> 31:18.973
then for a few days you come out of Sahajyoga.

31:19.093 --> 31:21.813
First you open the doors of your heart.

31:24.373 --> 31:28.873
With that only With its Shakti only Sahajyoga will spread.

31:30.093 --> 31:32.532
The question is that those who spread Sahajyoga

31:32.733 --> 31:36.293
they have the Shakti of love less and the Shakti of anger more.

31:36.413 --> 31:37.730
It will never spread.

31:39.733 --> 31:44.053
With love it will spread And with anger it will minimise and diminish.

31:45.813 --> 31:51.053
The teaching of Jesus is necessary for us to understand.

31:53.613 --> 31:56.213
Sorry ! I had to talk in Hindi language

31:56.413 --> 31:59.293
because most of the people are here Indians

31:59.493 --> 32:01.693
Some of them are Marathis

32:01.893 --> 32:05.413
and others are from North India.

32:06.253 --> 32:09.373
I was telling them about Christ.

32:09.573 --> 32:11.573
What was His power ?

32:11.773 --> 32:14.253
His power was of 'Love'.

32:16.613 --> 32:19.573
And not of anger

32:21.933 --> 32:25.133
Because He is the one

32:25.333 --> 32:27.693
who has crossed

32:27.893 --> 32:33.453
the most difficult center of Agnya.

32:35.573 --> 32:37.613
Those people who have ego

32:38.973 --> 32:40.853
never realise they have ego

32:42.453 --> 32:43.653
With their ego they do

32:43.853 --> 32:46.293
all kinds of nonsensical things.

32:46.933 --> 32:48.173
Without asking Me

32:48.373 --> 32:50.853
they have done something in Delhi.

32:51.613 --> 32:52.533
Without asking me

32:52.733 --> 32:54.653
they have done something in Russia.

32:55.213 --> 32:57.573
And it is so destructive to Sahajyoga.

32:58.693 --> 33:00.173
that they don't realise

33:01.133 --> 33:03.133
what they have done is the crime

33:03.333 --> 33:06.733
which is punishable by all Divine laws.

33:11.253 --> 33:13.733
If you want to do anything you must

33:14.253 --> 33:15.733
tell me beforehand.

33:16.693 --> 33:18.213
You must consult Me

33:18.413 --> 33:19.893
you must talk to Me

33:20.013 --> 33:23.173
Because I know what is happening.

33:23.773 --> 33:27.293
You don't know if somebody wants to cheat you.

33:29.013 --> 33:32.533
Then how will you know if you were

33:33.573 --> 33:35.693
so sensitive you would find out

33:38.573 --> 33:40.093
You would have asked Me,

33:40.293 --> 33:42.293
'Mother what should we do ?'

33:43.973 --> 33:45.573
At least ask Me.

33:46.813 --> 33:49.893
This is the main thing missing among

33:50.613 --> 33:52.173
Sahajyogis now that

33:52.373 --> 33:55.573
we have a kind of a very subtle ego.

33:56.493 --> 33:58.133
If you make somebody a leader

33:58.453 --> 34:00.413
it is very dangerous sometimes.

34:00.533 --> 34:03.253
If the leader developes ego because of his wife,

34:04.573 --> 34:06.413
It is a very difficult thing.

34:06.533 --> 34:08.653
They can destroy Sahajyoga completely.

34:12.413 --> 34:13.813
Anything is possible.

34:15.253 --> 34:17.653
So before you do anything like that

34:17.973 --> 34:19.333
you have to consult (Me).

34:19.853 --> 34:21.013
I am still living

34:21.813 --> 34:22.693
and you can ask.

34:23.533 --> 34:26.413
You can write to Me, you can telephone too.

34:28.933 --> 34:30.573
At least I am there to tell you.

34:31.853 --> 34:33.893
But then you have to develop

34:34.213 --> 34:36.053
your balance and your love.

34:36.893 --> 34:39.933
That is only through this Param Chaitanya

34:40.573 --> 34:43.533
It is all pervading power of Divine Love.

34:44.053 --> 34:47.013
You can develop that discretion.

34:47.813 --> 34:48.613
special

34:49.093 --> 34:51.813
.....powers.

34:52.333 --> 34:54.333
Even if somebody telephones to Me

34:54.453 --> 34:57.413
immediately I know what is wrong with that person.

34:58.773 --> 35:01.013
I don't say that you can become like Me.

35:01.213 --> 35:04.493
But at least you have vibrations to see.

35:05.213 --> 35:07.333
Also see your own vibrations.

35:08.533 --> 35:09.653
How are you moving ?

35:10.413 --> 35:11.853
Put a paper on your hand

35:12.453 --> 35:15.693
and you will see it will start shaking before My photograph.

35:17.693 --> 35:18.773
With this ego

35:20.133 --> 35:21.373
you cannot go further

35:21.973 --> 35:23.533
Why did you come to sahajyoga ?

35:24.293 --> 35:26.453
You came here not to become

35:26.653 --> 35:27.733
some sort of a leader

35:28.213 --> 35:29.613
or some sort of a

35:31.373 --> 35:32.453
a king but

35:33.773 --> 35:35.373
you came here

35:35.733 --> 35:38.813
to become a great guru.

35:39.373 --> 35:41.653
As you ask Me Gurupad Dijiye.

35:43.253 --> 35:46.173
For that you have to have in Sahajyoga

35:46.493 --> 35:49.133
a complete humility

35:50.053 --> 35:51.733
natural humility

35:55.413 --> 35:57.093
natural balance.

35:57.613 --> 36:00.853
This is what Christ has taught us.

36:14.173 --> 36:15.293
At that time

36:18.213 --> 36:20.533
I don't think that people had that much ego.

36:21.573 --> 36:24.453
Ego is a modern present to you.

36:25.733 --> 36:27.853
People get ego out of anything.

36:30.133 --> 36:35.653
For example, I met one lady once and found her ego very bad.

36:36.173 --> 36:38.613
I said, ''What is the matter with her?''

36:38.893 --> 36:41.293
So, I asked My daughters ,''What does she do?''

36:41.573 --> 36:45.333
They said," Mummy She knows how to make dolls.''

36:46.253 --> 36:47.373
For that she had ego.

36:49.653 --> 36:50.533
What is so great

36:51.373 --> 36:52.893
than to be a good sahajyogi

36:53.293 --> 36:55.653
You may be the king, you may be anything.

36:55.813 --> 36:57.573
Now you see the Prime Ministers

36:57.773 --> 36:59.613
and all of them going to jail.

37:01.453 --> 37:03.253
What are they compared to you?

37:03.373 --> 37:04.573
They have no balance.

37:05.373 --> 37:06.493
They have no sense.

37:09.453 --> 37:11.653
What makes you a separate

37:13.013 --> 37:14.093
individuals

37:14.813 --> 37:16.653
higher people, because

37:17.653 --> 37:20.693
you have no ego.

37:24.213 --> 37:26.493
Now people try to remove their ego

37:27.973 --> 37:29.053
Their two types.....

37:30.733 --> 37:33.933
So they will go on beating themselves with shoes.

37:36.093 --> 37:39.773
All kinds of ritualistic things they do to remove their ego.

37:40.893 --> 37:43.173
But all this we do with our mind.

37:44.333 --> 37:47.413
Whatever you do with your mind will give you ego only.

37:50.773 --> 37:51.933
They become ascetic.

37:52.213 --> 37:54.493
They are the greatest egoist.

37:54.693 --> 37:57.773
I must say, Hitler was the greatest ascetic.

37:58.613 --> 38:00.973
With his asceticism he became Hitler.

38:01.173 --> 38:04.253
If you want to become Hitler, you become ascetic.

38:05.093 --> 38:07.613
In Sahajyoga you are not allowed at all

38:08.053 --> 38:09.173
all this asceticism.

38:15.973 --> 38:18.013
You have to be loving

38:18.653 --> 38:19.733
affectionate

38:20.213 --> 38:22.293
kind and disciplined.

38:24.173 --> 38:27.253
I must say this because when you are loving

38:27.733 --> 38:30.653
you go out of bounds sometimes

38:31.133 --> 38:33.532
because you have no discipline of sahajyoga.

38:33.733 --> 38:39.573
Loving doesn't mean that you become like a

38:41.053 --> 38:42.773
Romeo, Juliet,doesn't mean that.

38:45.093 --> 38:48.653
You must have your balance through your discipline.

38:49.693 --> 38:51.493
If you have no discipline

38:51.613 --> 38:54.933
you can never be a good Sahajyogi.

38:58.613 --> 39:00.373
From the life of Christ

39:01.093 --> 39:02.213
we have to learn

39:02.933 --> 39:04.093
these things

39:04.293 --> 39:07.573
that unless and until we have these things

39:07.813 --> 39:09.853
we cannot

39:12.733 --> 39:14.133
become good Sahajyogis.

39:15.573 --> 39:17.293
Firstly, ritualistic nature

39:19.973 --> 39:21.493
secondly, anger

39:22.573 --> 39:24.613
thirdly, miserliness.

39:26.453 --> 39:28.613
like

39:29.093 --> 39:30.253
if you

39:31.493 --> 39:32.733
go to England

39:33.053 --> 39:34.133
it is written there

39:34.253 --> 39:36.693
'save pounds by taking a taxi'

39:41.373 --> 39:42.493
this is what it is.

39:43.053 --> 39:44.133
Miserliness

39:44.373 --> 39:46.493
where can we save money,

39:47.013 --> 39:50.212
'Mother, can you give concession?'

39:50.413 --> 39:54.213
it is not a some sort of a business I am doing here.

39:56.853 --> 40:00.333
'If you make it half price, so many will come'.

40:03.373 --> 40:05.293
''I am not using your money''.

40:05.693 --> 40:09.700
I am using it for your buildings, all this I have got it

40:10.453 --> 40:13.093
of course My money also and your money.

40:14.173 --> 40:15.653
So many things I have done

40:16.373 --> 40:17.853
The whole of Vashi

40:18.533 --> 40:20.253
the whole of Ashram

40:22.173 --> 40:23.653
In Delhi two ashrams,

40:24.093 --> 40:25.653
then the whole of school

40:26.613 --> 40:27.533
and also

40:28.213 --> 40:30.333
land in Pune and other places.

40:31.213 --> 40:32.973
Now in Pune they want Me

40:33.093 --> 40:35.573
to pay the land, to pay for everything

40:35.733 --> 40:38.413
and Pune people are the known Maharashtrians

40:38.533 --> 40:39.653
to be great

40:40.293 --> 40:42.293
miserly, kanjoos people.

40:45.213 --> 40:47.133
Even for their own

40:47.773 --> 40:51.333
ashram, they would like Me to pay for everything.

40:52.173 --> 40:54.693
and they nicely go and sing bhajans nicely.

40:55.093 --> 40:58.133
See they are good musicians, that is what they are.

40:58.333 --> 41:00.733
Very very miserly people.

41:06.413 --> 41:08.333
Miserly people can never love.

41:08.453 --> 41:09.533
Tthey love money.

41:11.093 --> 41:13.293
Egoistical people can never love

41:13.413 --> 41:15.253
because they love power

41:15.693 --> 41:16.773
to control others.

41:20.493 --> 41:22.773
They think theey are doing for Sahajyoga.

41:23.373 --> 41:24.453
but not.

41:24.573 --> 41:28.173
Unless until you do something for yourself and ego

41:28.653 --> 41:30.613
no use working for Sahajyoga.

41:34.293 --> 41:35.453
Look at The Christ

41:36.253 --> 41:38.333
He took birth in a very humble

41:38.933 --> 41:40.053
abode.

41:41.813 --> 41:43.173
But He was the king.

41:45.213 --> 41:46.733
And He lived with the poor

41:50.653 --> 41:51.933
and tried to save them.

41:52.053 --> 41:53.253
He saved the lepers.

41:53.453 --> 41:55.453
He saved so many people, there were.

41:55.653 --> 41:59.653
Twenty one people were cured by Him.

41:59.853 --> 42:03.253
Now sahaj yoga I don't know, how many thousands have been cured.

42:07.453 --> 42:09.933
But what is important is if you are curing

42:10.293 --> 42:12.533
you know that you are not curing

42:12.653 --> 42:15.453
It is the Divine power that is curing.

42:17.733 --> 42:19.333
You are not doing anything

42:20.973 --> 42:22.653
It is best to be like that.

42:22.773 --> 42:25.093
I feel the same way that I am doing nothing

42:25.733 --> 42:26.853
and I am Nishkriya

42:27.693 --> 42:28.573
doing nothing.

42:29.853 --> 42:31.253
but I am not lazy.

42:35.053 --> 42:37.933
You should be active but all your activity

42:38.053 --> 42:41.493
should come from the Divine power of 'Love'

42:42.373 --> 42:45.413
First of all you must extend your hands for l'ove'.

42:46.213 --> 42:47.493
You extend your heart

42:47.613 --> 42:48.653
extend your money

42:48.773 --> 42:51.893
house, everything for 'Love'

42:54.053 --> 42:56.853
Now once your wife doesn't allow others to come in

42:56.973 --> 42:59.333
throw her out of the house, I don't mind.

43:02.253 --> 43:05.893
Teach her how to be kind and generous

43:06.053 --> 43:08.165
otherway round for the husband.

43:09.213 --> 43:10.560
It is very important

43:11.053 --> 43:15.813
you have to be generous. You have to be kind, you have to be loving

43:16.373 --> 43:17.961
and sweet to others.

43:19.293 --> 43:21.373
Christ only once went into temper

43:21.573 --> 43:23.333
which He had a right to do that

43:23.653 --> 43:24.773
when He saw people

43:25.133 --> 43:26.973
selling things in the temple.

43:28.493 --> 43:29.773
Samething we have here.

43:31.333 --> 43:35.293
And if you don't go and buy anything from them they will be lost.

43:36.973 --> 43:39.732
But you only go and buy things from them because

43:39.933 --> 43:41.812
you have a habit of shopping.

43:42.013 --> 43:44.853
Anywhere they people go, they must shop

43:45.613 --> 43:46.693
is a habit

43:47.973 --> 43:49.413
shopping they must do.

43:49.533 --> 43:51.293
They will not see the greenery

43:51.453 --> 43:53.253
the beauty of nature, nothing.

43:54.453 --> 43:58.093
When I went to so many countries,you see I had to

43:58.933 --> 44:00.293
with my husband

44:01.173 --> 44:03.133
I had to go

44:03.413 --> 44:06.293
and see beautiful places like museums.

44:06.933 --> 44:08.013
I never used to shop.

44:09.093 --> 44:12.772
But when I have so many children then I have to shop.

44:12.973 --> 44:14.679
So I would go for shops.

44:15.093 --> 44:16.893
But not the way that

44:17.013 --> 44:18.973
that every place is for shopping.

44:19.773 --> 44:21.293
What is there to shop here

44:21.573 --> 44:24.813
when you have come here for your spiritual growth.

44:26.493 --> 44:28.773
In Mecca, do they have any shops?

44:32.773 --> 44:34.573
This is the holier than holi.

44:35.813 --> 44:38.493
Why should go to the shops ? I can't understand.

44:38.613 --> 44:41.373
I have told them not to have shops

44:41.573 --> 44:44.893
but you people are the ones, who encourage.

44:46.213 --> 44:49.013
who encouraged them to make money out of us ?

44:51.653 --> 44:53.653
Nothing essential to buy there.

44:54.933 --> 44:58.813
Now you have come to the holy occassion.

44:59.173 --> 45:02.693
Here you have come for your worship.

45:05.533 --> 45:07.773
In our Mahalaxmi temple

45:07.973 --> 45:10.213
there are people who are selling

45:10.413 --> 45:13.013
garlands and things for ladies' hair.

45:13.613 --> 45:15.893
But they say it is for the Goddess.

45:16.333 --> 45:17.453
And they buy there.

45:18.013 --> 45:20.333
All the people who are coming stupidly

45:21.053 --> 45:23.333
and give it

45:23.813 --> 45:25.733
to the brahmin in the temple

45:26.133 --> 45:28.173
and the Brahmin sells it back

45:28.973 --> 45:30.093
at a lower price.

45:30.773 --> 45:33.293
And these garlands are

45:33.773 --> 45:36.053
I don't know how many times sold and bought

45:36.173 --> 45:38.253
and sold and bought because of the

45:38.453 --> 45:40.653
stupidity of the people who go there.

45:41.693 --> 45:43.213
If they have to take something

45:43.413 --> 45:45.200
they should buy it from outside,

45:46.253 --> 45:48.173
not at the place where you have come.

45:54.253 --> 45:57.693
As it is you went to Delhi, you could have bought it there.

45:59.253 --> 46:00.813
or you came to Bombay

46:01.013 --> 46:03.693
you could have bought there but not in this place.

46:04.013 --> 46:07.373
We cannot make this place Bombay or Delhi

46:07.693 --> 46:09.773
otherwise why should we come here.

46:11.133 --> 46:12.933
That is why christ took a hunter

46:15.093 --> 46:19.333
and beat them those who were selling things near the church.

46:22.133 --> 46:23.213
Now they don't have

46:23.893 --> 46:26.493
I have seen, near the church they don't have.

46:26.693 --> 46:28.053
They have outside.

46:30.653 --> 46:32.253
But they sell other things

46:32.813 --> 46:35.773
like catholic church sells

46:36.413 --> 46:38.893
a wine called Benedictine.

46:39.013 --> 46:40.093
Imagine !

46:41.613 --> 46:42.733
That is another story.

46:44.573 --> 46:45.653
Christ went

46:49.453 --> 46:50.533
for wedding

46:52.533 --> 46:54.853
and they had no wine.

46:55.373 --> 46:56.973
Now in the Hibru language

46:57.213 --> 46:58.373
wine

46:58.573 --> 47:00.093
means

47:00.493 --> 47:02.933
the juice of the grapes.

47:03.133 --> 47:04.653
It doesn't mean fermented.

47:06.933 --> 47:09.733
So He converted water into black wine.

47:11.213 --> 47:12.493
You cannot convert

47:13.653 --> 47:16.293
water instatantaneously

47:16.693 --> 47:18.253
into wine.

47:18.453 --> 47:20.853
Wine has to rot , has to smell

47:20.973 --> 47:23.413
The more it smells, the best it is.

47:25.413 --> 47:29.293
But they think that Christ said you must drink this thing.

47:31.973 --> 47:33.053
He never said that.

47:34.453 --> 47:38.293
He just converted it into wine.

47:38.653 --> 47:39.493
meaning

47:39.973 --> 47:40.733
the

47:40.933 --> 47:44.853
taste of the juice of grapes.

47:45.533 --> 47:46.653
Once I went

47:47.573 --> 47:48.853
to some television

47:49.453 --> 47:52.533
and there was a very nice man in Italy.

47:52.733 --> 47:56.733
He said ,''Mother you first give me realisation''.

47:57.333 --> 47:59.933
So I said ,''Get some Water''. I put My hand into it.

48:00.453 --> 48:01.413
" Now you drink it".

48:01.733 --> 48:04.653
He said ,"It is tasting like wine".

48:05.053 --> 48:07.173
I said,"This is what Christ did".

48:08.133 --> 48:09.653
He got his realisation.

48:09.973 --> 48:12.893
Instantaneously, you cannot make wine.

48:14.213 --> 48:17.653
But if somebody dies, they will drink.

48:18.493 --> 48:20.693
If somebody is born, they will drink.

48:21.253 --> 48:24.573
At any cost, without drinking they are not normal.

48:30.773 --> 48:33.572
But the people who got realisation are suddenly changed.

48:33.773 --> 48:36.253
They don't want to drink. They have stopped drinking.

48:36.373 --> 48:38.252
Their attention has become nice.

48:38.453 --> 48:40.133
The whole thing is changed.

48:40.613 --> 48:42.893
This is the transformation that has worked

48:44.093 --> 48:46.853
of which Christ has talked, Mohammed sahib has talked

48:47.213 --> 48:50.133
everybody has talked about this particular time

48:50.333 --> 48:52.933
when people will get transformed.

48:53.293 --> 48:55.533
But even after transformation

48:55.933 --> 48:59.213
you do not want to become what you have to be

49:01.133 --> 49:03.139
for which you have come here.

49:04.653 --> 49:05.973
You will be left behind.

49:06.693 --> 49:07.780
It is a big

49:16.693 --> 49:18.796
transformation is taking place.

49:20.133 --> 49:23.589
In that transformation also your rising is taking place.

49:24.213 --> 49:26.933
There is a big evolution going on

49:27.333 --> 49:30.173
and those who will not evolve properly

49:30.373 --> 49:31.693
will be left behind.

49:35.493 --> 49:39.173
As it is said that, it is the last judgement.

49:41.053 --> 49:42.664
And you will be judged.

49:42.933 --> 49:44.653
You will be left behind.

49:45.693 --> 49:48.653
You cannot adhere to people who are rising higher.

49:49.573 --> 49:51.573
With your weight you will fall down.

49:53.653 --> 49:55.293
So for you

49:56.893 --> 49:58.253
to understand Christ

49:58.493 --> 50:01.333
is all these qualities you must have.

50:02.213 --> 50:06.253
If you are hot tempered , alright , go and beat yourself with shoes.

50:07.013 --> 50:09.493
But if you are not, then you need not.

50:10.773 --> 50:12.133
You must know what you are.

50:12.253 --> 50:13.693
First of all introspect.

50:13.813 --> 50:16.093
Accordingly you should work it out.

50:16.293 --> 50:20.053
But this ritualism is not allwed in Sahajyoga all the time.

50:37.533 --> 50:40.253
I would love all my children.

50:41.973 --> 50:44.973
To be extremely loving and collective.

50:46.653 --> 50:50.893
Not to denounce anybody for no rhyme and reason

50:51.253 --> 50:53.693
and if you have to denounce, you should tell Me.

50:54.013 --> 50:55.853
I know what is what !

50:56.533 --> 50:59.893
Without asking Me, you should not measure up somebody

51:00.013 --> 51:01.653
and say i have measured somebody.

51:01.773 --> 51:03.996
With what ? what is your yardstick ?

51:06.413 --> 51:10.413
You yourself you are caught up in the web of ego.

51:12.533 --> 51:15.853
You cannot condemn anyone without telling Me.

51:16.613 --> 51:18.012
You have to tell me.

51:18.213 --> 51:21.133
Don't worry that this thing will disturb Me or anything

51:21.333 --> 51:22.892
but you should ask.

51:23.093 --> 51:24.772
I know about everyone.

51:24.973 --> 51:28.573
May be I have not mat that person but i can feel the vibrations.

51:31.173 --> 51:32.573
You can write to me.

51:33.157 --> 51:35.972
Many people just telephone, that is not the way.

51:36.173 --> 51:39.893
You must write to Me because I read each and every letter.

51:40.453 --> 51:44.772
But all nonsensical letters you should not write also to waste my time.

51:44.973 --> 51:50.053
.....like my father's mother's, mother, this thing

51:50.253 --> 51:55.293
is sick or is dead and her bhoot is moving about.

51:58.773 --> 52:01.573
All sorts of funny letters come to Me.

52:01.774 --> 52:04.853
What can I do for such people ? That is not important.

52:04.973 --> 52:07.733
All: "I need money, I have no money.

52:07.933 --> 52:12.933
I am depending on you for money. So please send me money."

52:15.453 --> 52:17.613
You can ask on my photograph.

52:19.453 --> 52:23.373
If you are a good Sahajyogi, you don't have to worry for money also.

52:26.173 --> 52:30.533
Or i have no child ,Mother what to do? Mother i want to have a child.

52:30.653 --> 52:33.962
Those who have child, ask them what do else they have to say.

52:35.813 --> 52:39.373
So many have got children after coming to Sahajyoga

52:39.493 --> 52:41.413
but you must deserve it.

52:46.653 --> 52:50.213
So many miracles have taken place.

52:50.413 --> 52:53.813
So many people have been cured no doubt.

52:54.973 --> 52:57.333
But that doesn't mean that you have done it.

52:59.093 --> 53:03.093
Don't get into the trap of ego.

53:05.893 --> 53:08.013
That is most dangerous.

53:08.773 --> 53:12.773
If you destroy sahajyoga, you are destroying yourself.

53:18.173 --> 53:21.573
So, today you all have to promise in your heart.

53:22.733 --> 53:24.653
Put your hands to your heart

53:25.053 --> 53:25.973
and to say

53:27.013 --> 53:29.253
''Mother, We love,

53:30.693 --> 53:33.093
We spread your Divine Love,

53:33.733 --> 53:35.853
encompass the whole world,

53:36.373 --> 53:38.613
give realisation to all the people.

53:39.373 --> 53:40.453
Will not shout,

53:41.613 --> 53:42.973
will not be angry,

53:43.373 --> 53:49.213
will not do the all kinds of rituals but just surrender.

53:50.253 --> 53:51.733
Surrender our ego

53:52.453 --> 53:53.373
surrender ego

53:53.773 --> 53:55.293
surrender your ego.

53:55.533 --> 53:57.693
All your problems can be solved.

53:58.093 --> 54:00.013
because, as long as, there is ego

54:00.333 --> 54:02.613
this divine power doesn't take over.

54:03.333 --> 54:04.453
You may do anything

54:04.853 --> 54:07.533
You are not connected. Your connection is missing.

54:08.773 --> 54:11.093
Christ is missing. He is no more.

54:13.493 --> 54:18.373
To establish Him first of all you must show how you love.

54:18.693 --> 54:21.213
That doesn't mean that you love your wife,

54:21.333 --> 54:23.693
love your children and love your house.

54:25.333 --> 54:27.453
You have to love everyone.

54:28.893 --> 54:31.613
Try to make everyone happy.

54:32.813 --> 54:34.213
That is why I like music

54:34.333 --> 54:37.453
because through music you can spread vibrations.

54:38.693 --> 54:41.613
Very good media of spreading vibrations

54:42.613 --> 54:44.372
of loving vibrations.

54:44.573 --> 54:48.653
But those who are musicians have to be loving people,

54:50.653 --> 54:51.970
not hot tempered

54:53.573 --> 54:54.978
not showing off

54:56.733 --> 54:59.493
not thinking too much of themselves.

55:00.933 --> 55:02.333
All these will work

55:03.093 --> 55:05.133
very well if you understand

55:05.333 --> 55:08.333
that this Divine power

55:08.533 --> 55:10.453
is so powerful.

55:12.413 --> 55:13.533
No doubt it is love,

55:14.333 --> 55:16.733
no doubt it is truth,

55:17.653 --> 55:19.333
and no doubt

55:21.013 --> 55:24.933
if you get out of it, you will be caught up by anything

55:25.133 --> 55:27.133
and you could be finished.

55:29.453 --> 55:31.733
It is a very very

55:32.933 --> 55:38.013
powerful, effective and absolutely conclusive

55:39.173 --> 55:41.493
power you have within yourself.

55:42.613 --> 55:45.413
And thanks to christ that crucified Himself

55:45.773 --> 55:48.173
sacrificed his body for our sake

55:48.453 --> 55:49.933
that our agnya is opened up.

55:50.133 --> 55:52.533
Otherwise I could not have done this Sahajyoga.

55:54.853 --> 55:56.493
But in this area

55:56.693 --> 55:59.933
we have Buddha, Christ and Mahavira.

56:02.373 --> 56:04.973
and they had to do tapasya, tapaha.

56:05.453 --> 56:06.373
They did it.

56:06.573 --> 56:10.133
You don't have to do now, they have done for you.

56:14.893 --> 56:17.333
Now see I saw the musicians yesterday.

56:17.533 --> 56:19.932
In two three months they have learnt so much,

56:20.133 --> 56:23.133
otherwise formerly  all the musicians I knew.

56:23.333 --> 56:24.693
For Indian music

56:25.573 --> 56:27.293
had to really starve.

56:27.893 --> 56:30.133
For months together they had to practice

56:30.333 --> 56:34.053
years together, they had to bow to their guru.

56:34.253 --> 56:36.213
That is all over now.

56:38.653 --> 56:40.813
because of this Param Chaitanya

56:41.013 --> 56:42.813
and your power

56:44.053 --> 56:46.413
to be one with the Divine.

56:46.613 --> 56:50.213
This Divine power can transform you completely

56:50.413 --> 56:52.093
to such an extent

56:52.293 --> 56:54.173
that anything that you want to do,

56:54.373 --> 56:56.133
you can do it in two, three months.

56:58.093 --> 57:00.253
In Pune when they were singing

57:00.733 --> 57:03.333
'foreigners' as we call them with respect.

57:03.533 --> 57:06.773
In India 'foreigners' means respect , not like other countries.

57:08.173 --> 57:09.373
So they were singing.

57:09.573 --> 57:13.253
They were some very great musicians (who) had come.

57:13.893 --> 57:17.213
They told  Me,"Mother, we put down our head to them."

57:17.613 --> 57:19.453
Because how could these people

57:19.653 --> 57:24.053
who don't know a word about Indian music have learnt it so well

57:24.173 --> 57:27.533
and the pronunciation of these Marathi languages were difficult.

57:27.733 --> 57:29.653
But they are so good at it

57:29.853 --> 57:31.493
is very surprising.

57:33.173 --> 57:37.053
Now all this has happened in your presence,

57:38.493 --> 57:39.613
in your presence.

57:40.933 --> 57:43.580
It is nice here, you have balloons here.

57:43.813 --> 57:45.773
to celebrate Christ's birthday.

57:45.893 --> 57:49.173
and all these balloons of your ego should be burst,

57:49.773 --> 57:50.893
should be finished.

57:53.013 --> 57:59.333
(clapping)

58:04.813 --> 58:07.933
I will be happy if you could learn Hindi language.

58:09.013 --> 58:11.813
But I know My English may not be so good

58:11.933 --> 58:14.933
but best is to learn hindi,

58:15.933 --> 58:17.853
if possible.

58:18.053 --> 58:22.373
Because there are already fourteen languages in India

58:23.333 --> 58:25.933
and so many languages in another country.

58:26.933 --> 58:30.092
Every country has a different type of English language.

58:30.293 --> 58:31.893
If you go to America,

58:32.013 --> 58:35.293
I don't understand their English for at least two, three days.

58:35.413 --> 58:36.933
Because they go on

58:37.133 --> 58:38.573
taking their

58:38.773 --> 58:40.573
....tongue

58:41.053 --> 58:44.533
and lips on one side, then on another side.

58:50.533 --> 58:53.693
English of the French is another point.

58:53.893 --> 58:55.973
So best is to learn Hindi.

58:56.173 --> 59:00.653
and that too a good Hindi, not Sanskritized.

59:00.773 --> 59:04.373
But as they say (Rozmara) i.e., day- to- day- Hindi because

59:04.733 --> 59:07.933
I feel better if you understand what I am saying.

59:08.053 --> 59:10.413
It is not difficult because you are all sahajyogis.

59:10.533 --> 59:13.693
You can learn Hindi in no time. I am not saying you learn Sanskrit.

59:13.813 --> 59:15.053
But Hindi is very easy.

59:15.173 --> 59:17.013
Try to. It is not My Mother tongue.

59:17.213 --> 59:19.693
I have never studied Hindi language, never.

59:20.133 --> 59:23.653
But you see it is a very easy language to learn.

59:24.413 --> 59:29.173
But as My father told Me ,"Never teach Hindi language

59:29.613 --> 59:31.093
to an English man."

59:33.733 --> 59:35.493
I said," Why this advise ?"

59:35.973 --> 59:38.452
He said," There was an English man who was after me

59:38.653 --> 59:40.799
that i should teach him Hindi."

59:41.413 --> 59:45.333
so he said," I have to tell my servant to open the door

59:46.933 --> 59:48.333
or to close the door.''

59:50.173 --> 59:52.893
So for open the door he said you say

59:53.653 --> 59:58.933
'there was a cool day', means 'Darwaza khol de'

01:00:04.173 --> 01:00:05.601
(clapping)

01:00:12.413 --> 01:00:16.693
And for closing the door, you have to say, 'There was a banker'

01:00:18.533 --> 01:00:22.013
"Maine darwaza bandh kar dey" (means close the door)

01:00:24.373 --> 01:00:26.053
But now it is different.

01:00:27.733 --> 01:00:30.613
They will pick up Hindi very quickly.

01:00:31.933 --> 01:00:33.653
Very quickly, I can see that.

01:00:33.853 --> 01:00:38.773
If you can learn this horrible Indian classical music

01:00:38.933 --> 01:00:42.693
which is so difficult, so easily, what will happen ?

01:00:43.573 --> 01:00:47.293
They can learn Hindi in no time and make Me happier every time.

01:00:47.493 --> 01:00:50.412
Not because Hindi is My language- It is not, it is Marathi.

01:00:50.613 --> 01:00:51.933
Marathi is very difficult.

01:00:52.053 --> 01:00:55.373
I don't think you can learn Marathi. It is very precise.

01:00:55.493 --> 01:00:57.760
I think that is one of the best languages

01:00:57.961 --> 01:01:00.253
to put down your ego.

01:01:02.124 --> 01:01:04.972
That is why Maharashtrians are normally not egoistical,

01:01:05.173 --> 01:01:08.493
because in their language it is built in process.

01:01:09.053 --> 01:01:11.413
For example somebody is boasting,

01:01:13.453 --> 01:01:15.693
that I have done this, I have done that.

01:01:16.013 --> 01:01:20.733
So in Marathi they will say, " Don't climb on a bush."

01:01:20.973 --> 01:01:25.933
or what we call the tree of channa which is so big as that.

01:01:27.773 --> 01:01:29.452
Then the person is finished.

01:01:29.653 --> 01:01:32.093
Like that there are many words by which

01:01:32.293 --> 01:01:35.373
you can put down the ego of the man on his face.

01:01:35.533 --> 01:01:38.933
So Marathi language has so many advantages.

01:01:39.173 --> 01:01:43.252
but I would not ask you to learn Marathi language. It is not so easy.

01:01:43.453 --> 01:01:47.733
But Hindi you should. It is very easy, very easy.

01:01:47.933 --> 01:01:51.973
but you must know one  thing that in Hindi language

01:01:52.773 --> 01:01:53.773
there is 'Adab'.

01:01:54.253 --> 01:01:58.053
'Adab' means modesty

01:01:58.253 --> 01:02:03.973
and respect

01:02:04.613 --> 01:02:09.293
respect, but more than respect it is a style of saying.

01:02:10.373 --> 01:02:13.973
Not ' Urdu ' but Hindi of day - to- day talking

01:02:14.293 --> 01:02:17.893
there is respect and a way to address others,

01:02:19.653 --> 01:02:20.973
to address others.

01:02:21.173 --> 01:02:22.093
All this

01:02:23.173 --> 01:02:24.293
will give you

01:02:25.213 --> 01:02:28.813
a kind of a more

01:02:30.213 --> 01:02:32.093
flexible vehichle

01:02:33.373 --> 01:02:35.013
to express your love.

01:02:36.213 --> 01:02:40.133
Because in Hindi language we can never translate 'I hate you'.

01:02:40.253 --> 01:02:41.413
We never say like that.

01:02:42.293 --> 01:02:43.293
I hate you.

01:02:44.093 --> 01:02:46.733
'I hate you' will anybody say like that ?

01:02:48.573 --> 01:02:49.853
We cannot say.

01:02:50.053 --> 01:02:52.293
To hate somebody is sinful.

01:02:53.693 --> 01:02:55.685
So they can never say,'I hate you.'

01:03:00.893 --> 01:03:03.293
Chastity is more in Marathi language

01:03:03.413 --> 01:03:04.653
but it is a little hard

01:03:04.813 --> 01:03:07.693
because it has got such as I told you

01:03:08.413 --> 01:03:13.213
......idioms which can correct you just there.

01:03:15.093 --> 01:03:21.333
All this is just to request now if you can learn this music,

01:03:22.333 --> 01:03:23.773
which is very difficult.

01:03:24.293 --> 01:03:27.173
You can always learn a simple Hindi language

01:03:27.933 --> 01:03:32.133
which is very very easy and very very easy to talk.

01:03:40.293 --> 01:03:44.213
There are so many things , I would like you to know about Christ

01:03:44.733 --> 01:03:45.733
But this is

01:03:46.533 --> 01:03:48.893
short time in which I cannot tell you.

01:03:50.733 --> 01:03:53.773
The way He had His own priorities.

01:03:58.333 --> 01:04:01.493
Though in the Bible He is not described fully, I should say

01:04:01.613 --> 01:04:05.493
and whatever it might have been they have reduced it.

01:04:06.333 --> 01:04:07.332
Maybe,

01:04:07.533 --> 01:04:10.653
and the way they practice Christianity is shocking.

01:04:11.333 --> 01:04:17.613
So one has to learn Christianity through the heart.

01:04:18.053 --> 01:04:19.053
No other way out.

01:04:20.733 --> 01:04:25.173
They should learn through the Heart, Heart of your Mother.

01:04:26.893 --> 01:04:28.253
May God bless you !
