1
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:10,140
Keep your eyes open.

2
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,140
Now all the children should put their hands link this.

3
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,060
All right?

4
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,700
And watch Me.

5
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:06,220
Lift your tongues and put them back

6
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,900
as much as possible.

7
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,620
Turn it backward.

8
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,380
Let it feel the bliss of the Divine on its tip.

9
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:38,260
Now put your chin down, touching your…

10
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,500
don’t close your eyes.

11
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,980
In complete surrender,

12
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,940
put the chin.

13
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:00,500
But don’t close your eyes.

14
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,980
Pay attention to your Sahasrara.

15
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,900
Loosen your hands fully on the sides,

16
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:23,620
make them loose. Sit straight.

17
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,260
Do not touch the palate.

18
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:03,060
Now breathe in.

19
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,660
Do not push back the tongue. Keep the tongue where it is.

20
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,620
Breathe in.

21
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:22,540
Now raise your stomach, without taking out the breath, upward,

22
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:27,380
pushing the air upward towards the lungs.

23
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,580
Push your stomach in.

24
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:41,500
Attention on the Sahasrara.

25
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:57,580
You start seeing light through Sahasrara.

26
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,580
Sort of the Sahasrara becomes like eyes.

27
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,900
Now leave it.

28
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:18,060
Leave it now.

29
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,740
Raise your head.

30
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:31,420
Now put back your heads.

31
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,060
Put the fingers [in the ears].

32
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,260
Put the attention to your Sahasrara, that’s all.

33
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,340
Don’t say anything, no mantras.

34
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:46,140
Take out your tongue,

35
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,260
push it back.

36
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,020
Take in your breath.

37
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,500
Push the stomach.

38
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,340
That’s good.

39
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:35,020
Now watch Me continuously without blinking.

40
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,140
Without any pressure on the eyes.

41
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,740
Attention on the Sahasrara.

42
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:51,660
You can do it without blinking.

43
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,060
May God bless you.

44
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:13,260
This is it, physically, we have worked out our attention,

45
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:20,660
on our Vishuddhi and on our Agnya.

46
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:32,620
The left Vishuddhi is still there.

47
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:40,100
Now put your head more on the right side,

48
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,340
loose, like this.

49
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:48,740
With the attention on the Sahasrara, looking at Me.

50
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,380
Put it loose.

51
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:58,300
Hand to be loose.

52
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,620
Loosen it.

53
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,300
Now better.

54
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:28,420
You feel the Kundalini rising?

55
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:36,460
Let us put ourselves into bandhan after raising our Kundalini.

56
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,940
Raise.

57
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:43,140
Attention on your Sahasrara. Don’t close your eyes,

58
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,380
push back your head.

59
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,380
One.

60
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,260
Again.

61
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,780
Sit straight.

62
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:56,260
Take it up on your head.

63
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,140
Two…

64
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,900
three.

65
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,660
Now a bandhan.

66
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,500
One,

67
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,620
two.

68
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,180
Do it properly, systematically.

69
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:27,700
Three. All of us should do properly. Three…

70
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,100
four…

71
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,260
five…

72
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,740
Try to wait as I am doing it…

73
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,020
six…

74
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,460
seven.

75
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,020
Still we have not done it properly.

76
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:53,420
We all should do in one rhythm. Let’s do it again.

77
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,380
One. slowly…

78
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:03,220
two, with attention on the Sahasrara…

79
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:07,340
three…How do I do it? …

80
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,060
four…

81
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,380
five…good…

82
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,340
six.

83
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,260
Attention on Sahasrara…seven.

84
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,820
Rising?

85
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,420
Let’s have the last binding…

86
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,500
Now see.

87
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,060
Clear?

88
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,220
Tremendous.

89
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,220
May God bless you.
