1
00:02:33,283 --> 00:02:36,523
Welcome to all of you.

2
00:02:52,243 --> 00:02:57,203
This great country is also passing through a crisis.

3
00:02:57,403 --> 00:03:01,483
Nowadays I feel there are so many things that are happening

4
00:03:01,683 --> 00:03:04,803
which you could never dream before.

5
00:03:05,003 --> 00:03:07,963
And at this time you all have arrived

6
00:03:08,163 --> 00:03:12,763
bringing peace and joy to all of them.

7
00:03:13,123 --> 00:03:17,603
So I thank you for that.

8
00:03:28,483 --> 00:03:34,483
The strife and the strain which is on human beings is

9
00:03:34,883 --> 00:03:42,843
perhaps because they are not yet worthy of God's blessings.

10
00:03:43,243 --> 00:03:47,363
Still, as God has created them,

11
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:51,803
He tries to do His utmost

12
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:55,163
to see that human beings are kept comfortably

13
00:03:55,363 --> 00:03:58,443
alright on this Mother Earth.

14
00:03:58,723 --> 00:04:02,323
He creates all kinds of beautiful things as you see

15
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:06,363
and the whole cosmos is in unison

16
00:04:06,763 --> 00:04:11,243
and working out something very great today.

17
00:04:11,683 --> 00:04:15,283
This new revolution that has started,

18
00:04:15,843 --> 00:04:18,963
very, very silently,

19
00:04:19,323 --> 00:04:22,363
today is taking it's shape

20
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:28,763
and is providing a new future for all of us.

21
00:04:29,043 --> 00:04:33,243
You see those big, big trees, that are on top of your head

22
00:04:33,603 --> 00:04:39,403
and as long as you are sitting here no fruit will fall upon you.

23
00:04:39,683 --> 00:04:41,963
It's not because I am here

24
00:04:42,163 --> 00:04:44,923
but because this Mother Earth knows

25
00:04:45,123 --> 00:04:47,763
that there are such great saints sitting here

26
00:04:47,963 --> 00:04:51,683
and She is not going to disturb.

27
00:04:57,403 --> 00:05:00,803
This place was called as Shrigaav I was told,

28
00:05:01,123 --> 00:05:06,523
means the village of the Goddess.

29
00:05:06,883 --> 00:05:10,723
And this fruit is called as Shriphal,

30
00:05:10,923 --> 00:05:13,683
meaning the fruit of the Goddess.

31
00:05:13,963 --> 00:05:20,323
But actually if you see, a coconut is something like our Sahasrara

32
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:28,483
and is very auspicious because it can absorb lot of vibrations,

33
00:05:29,803 --> 00:05:32,923
as if it has got its realization.

34
00:05:33,123 --> 00:05:36,003
As you people can absorb My vibrations,

35
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:41,203
this fruit can absorb also My vibrations,

36
00:05:41,923 --> 00:05:46,203
in the greatest amount.

37
00:05:46,483 --> 00:05:50,403
So we are here today

38
00:05:50,603 --> 00:05:54,283
in a very big way

39
00:05:58,883 --> 00:06:05,123
to advertise the coming of the New Age.

40
00:06:06,803 --> 00:06:11,163
The coming of

41
00:06:11,763 --> 00:06:17,162
the Golden Era, people have talked about.

42
00:06:17,603 --> 00:06:21,043
Here we are to say

43
00:06:21,283 --> 00:06:27,083
what is reality, what is truth, what is joy.

44
00:06:27,683 --> 00:06:33,323
Here we are to manifest that and also

45
00:06:37,723 --> 00:06:43,523
to create a commotion or a movement

46
00:06:44,163 --> 00:06:51,123
in the cosmos so that this new awareness

47
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:57,323
is established in the cosmos

48
00:06:57,683 --> 00:07:00,963
which will enlighten this country

49
00:07:01,163 --> 00:07:03,963
and the people of this country.

50
00:07:04,403 --> 00:07:09,763
Also you will pick up the threads of this movement within yourself

51
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:14,923
which is a very subtle movement going on.

52
00:07:16,323 --> 00:07:21,363
At this moment we are in a strife of an intellectual

53
00:07:21,563 --> 00:07:25,363
who tried to describe

54
00:07:25,803 --> 00:07:30,803
Shri Rama and Shri Krishna, in a slurring manner.

55
00:07:31,523 --> 00:07:38,123
And this is the time I want to bring your attention

56
00:07:38,563 --> 00:07:46,523
that if this intellectual strife to use the intelligence

57
00:07:46,763 --> 00:07:53,003
to bring down all the ideals which enlighten our path,

58
00:07:53,283 --> 00:07:57,723
which gives us the guideline and an aspiration,

59
00:07:58,203 --> 00:08:05,243
then our lives become absolutely mundane, useless, joyless.

60
00:08:07,643 --> 00:08:12,292
It's very easy to condemn an ideal life,

61
00:08:13,123 --> 00:08:17,283
but to attain that life is very difficult.

62
00:08:18,283 --> 00:08:21,683
And some people, because they cannot attain it,

63
00:08:21,883 --> 00:08:28,563
try to condemn it so that they feel that they are no less,

64
00:08:28,843 --> 00:08:32,643
no way less than those great lives.

65
00:08:35,363 --> 00:08:40,163
All these ideals are created, these images are created,

66
00:08:40,363 --> 00:08:46,203
everywhere in the world by the Divine power

67
00:08:47,843 --> 00:08:51,643
and people look at them

68
00:08:51,843 --> 00:08:59,123
and think that these great lives are beautiful,

69
00:08:59,443 --> 00:09:05,843
though they have suffered a lot, but there is so much of

70
00:09:06,403 --> 00:09:11,323
deeper understanding

71
00:09:11,683 --> 00:09:18,483
and deeper balancing and a deeper love.

72
00:09:21,203 --> 00:09:28,243
These ideals are very important for human societies

73
00:09:28,523 --> 00:09:32,163
otherwise they will be absolutely living in a relatively

74
00:09:32,403 --> 00:09:38,403
and they will have no absolute measure

75
00:09:38,883 --> 00:09:42,843
to find out what is right and what is wrong.

76
00:09:44,923 --> 00:09:48,123
In Sahaja Yoga we are here first of all

77
00:09:48,323 --> 00:09:50,763
to get connected with God Almighty,

78
00:09:50,963 --> 00:09:55,083
with His power, the All-Pervading Power of Chaitanya.

79
00:09:55,523 --> 00:10:00,763
By that we become our own master,

80
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:06,563
in the sense that we get our own guidelines.

81
00:10:06,843 --> 00:10:10,003
If some Sahaja Yogi has not achieved that much

82
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:13,043
then is a serious thing.

83
00:10:13,243 --> 00:10:16,043
At least a Sahaja Yogi should be able to see,

84
00:10:16,243 --> 00:10:22,003
at the minimum of minimum, what is wrong with that person.

85
00:10:26,323 --> 00:10:32,763
To cleanse yourself and to put yourself right is of course,

86
00:10:33,363 --> 00:10:40,083
is a very important duty of every Sahaja Yogi.

87
00:10:40,483 --> 00:10:43,043
But these things are not to be taken

88
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:46,562
as condemnation of yourself by any chance.

89
00:10:46,763 --> 00:10:50,563
And you should not be identified with those problems that you have

90
00:10:50,763 --> 00:10:57,079
but try to face them and cure them.

91
00:10:58,563 --> 00:11:00,683
Many a times I have heard Sahaja Yogis saying

92
00:11:00,883 --> 00:11:03,283
that Indians are very simple people

93
00:11:03,483 --> 00:11:05,523
they are not complicated, Mother,

94
00:11:05,803 --> 00:11:11,563
so they can achieve their ascent much faster.

95
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:19,843
But it's not that. It is very different for all of you, very much.

96
00:11:20,363 --> 00:11:23,563
And despite all the complications, and all kinds of brain washing,

97
00:11:23,763 --> 00:11:27,203
and all kinds of book reading and all kinds of so-called seeking,

98
00:11:27,403 --> 00:11:30,603
and all that nonsense one has gone through,

99
00:11:30,803 --> 00:11:33,483
you have come out of it,

100
00:11:33,883 --> 00:11:36,843
you have washed yourself completely

101
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:44,283
and today you are there united together to face

102
00:11:44,563 --> 00:11:47,243
all that is absurd,

103
00:11:47,443 --> 00:11:51,123
all that is false, all that is wrong.

104
00:11:51,923 --> 00:11:57,683
It has to be a very formidable army for us

105
00:11:58,043 --> 00:12:02,403
because if you see around, even in this country,

106
00:12:02,603 --> 00:12:04,643
you call it not complicated,

107
00:12:04,843 --> 00:12:08,563
there are many who are all the time to complicate others

108
00:12:08,803 --> 00:12:15,443
and to destroy all their ideals, destroy all their visions

109
00:12:15,683 --> 00:12:20,963
and brainwash them.

110
00:12:21,563 --> 00:12:26,083
So you have to be very alert yourself

111
00:12:26,283 --> 00:12:29,443
and you have to be very conscious,

112
00:12:29,643 --> 00:12:36,643
that it is you who is going to build up this great image

113
00:12:36,883 --> 00:12:41,683
of ideal people,

114
00:12:41,963 --> 00:12:48,523
not one ideal life but ideal people in all collectivities.

115
00:12:49,203 --> 00:12:53,723
Now on your way to our tour,

116
00:12:53,923 --> 00:13:00,963
you are now on the threshold of entering into a new dimension,

117
00:13:01,603 --> 00:13:04,523
it is a subtler dimension,

118
00:13:05,003 --> 00:13:10,018
and this subtler dimension is within ourselves.

119
00:13:10,643 --> 00:13:17,203
And there lies your own being as your Spirit.

120
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:21,323
It sees you as separate,

121
00:13:21,723 --> 00:13:25,803
your Self is separate from yourself.

122
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:31,923
All these identifications have to be dropped out,

123
00:13:32,403 --> 00:13:35,723
all kinds of misidentifications.

124
00:13:36,163 --> 00:13:41,643
I was reading one of the marriages lists and all that,

125
00:13:41,843 --> 00:13:45,163
somebody says that they will marry Indians,

126
00:13:45,363 --> 00:13:47,683
some say we will not marry Indians,

127
00:13:47,883 --> 00:13:50,043
some say, we will not change the country,

128
00:13:50,243 --> 00:13:54,163
some say they will change the country.

129
00:13:58,203 --> 00:14:03,203
Even after Sahaja Yoga (...)

130
00:14:03,523 --> 00:14:07,723
if we stick on to one country as our own

131
00:14:09,003 --> 00:14:13,523
then I must say that we have to give up those limitations.

132
00:14:13,803 --> 00:14:20,003
The time has come. Of course you have the choice.

133
00:14:20,963 --> 00:14:24,363
Nobody is going to force you to do anything

134
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:29,403
but it also expresses your personality

135
00:14:30,243 --> 00:14:37,243
that you still are lingering on to these small, small limitations.

136
00:14:39,243 --> 00:14:43,043
As I have told you many a times

137
00:14:43,403 --> 00:14:46,483
God created only one world.

138
00:14:46,763 --> 00:14:51,563
Of course He created varieties just to create beauty.

139
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:55,803
But how blind we are

140
00:14:56,203 --> 00:15:00,923
that we think we are different people,

141
00:15:01,203 --> 00:15:05,843
we are of different countries, of different races,

142
00:15:06,203 --> 00:15:12,123
of different castes, communities, cities -

143
00:15:12,403 --> 00:15:19,163
then little, little rows, then houses.

144
00:15:19,603 --> 00:15:26,843
I would say we become from human beings to rats and rats to worms

145
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:32,283
and then I don't know what is the situation later .

146
00:15:33,203 --> 00:15:37,883
Let's open our heart, let's become great,

147
00:15:38,323 --> 00:15:41,323
we have to be like lions,

148
00:15:41,643 --> 00:15:47,483
not to be small and creepy people like worms.

149
00:15:47,803 --> 00:15:51,243
There are many worms everywhere in the world.

150
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:56,283
We are specially chosen people to be something great.

151
00:15:56,723 --> 00:16:01,723
So open your heart. That's the main problem.

152
00:16:02,043 --> 00:16:05,123
This ego covers the heart

153
00:16:05,363 --> 00:16:10,843
and makes you feel that, “Now I am an Indian, I am a Christian,

154
00:16:11,043 --> 00:16:15,003
I am this thing, I am that thing.”

155
00:16:15,523 --> 00:16:23,403
Now if I say to someone that you are not to go to temple,

156
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:27,403
then I must be

157
00:16:27,683 --> 00:16:33,123
a very cruel person to say that not to go to a temple.

158
00:16:35,923 --> 00:16:42,003
But they go to a temple and come back with such a big

159
00:16:43,763 --> 00:16:47,283
entity on their heads.

160
00:16:48,163 --> 00:16:50,883
Then they go to churches.

161
00:16:51,163 --> 00:16:53,363
The other day I had a very bad experience of a lady

162
00:16:53,563 --> 00:16:58,243
who went to a church in France

163
00:16:58,443 --> 00:17:01,523
and she has become

164
00:17:01,763 --> 00:17:05,643
something like a minister, maybe something like a pope.

165
00:17:06,603 --> 00:17:11,003
I mean something very funny you know, nothing normal.

166
00:17:11,763 --> 00:17:15,563
I couldn't discover it, when I asked she said, “I went to a church.”

167
00:17:15,763 --> 00:17:20,403
“Why?”
“Because they arranged a marriage there." “Why?”

168
00:17:20,723 --> 00:17:23,003
“Oh, they wanted to have a big social event

169
00:17:23,203 --> 00:17:24,963
so they wanted to have a marriage.”

170
00:17:25,163 --> 00:17:28,403
But you could just have a registered marriage, finish it off.

171
00:17:28,643 --> 00:17:33,683
Why do you want to go to a church, where all dead bodies are buried?

172
00:17:35,603 --> 00:17:39,843
To get back some of them on your heads?

173
00:17:40,763 --> 00:17:42,883
So we have to be prepared to

174
00:17:43,123 --> 00:17:47,883
give up all the shackles of nonsense from our heads.

175
00:17:48,643 --> 00:17:53,563
All kinds of things there are, so much of conditionings

176
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:57,003
come down even to the colour scheme,

177
00:17:57,283 --> 00:18:00,683
then it's all conditioning.

178
00:18:01,403 --> 00:18:04,643
This is too much, not good!

179
00:18:05,003 --> 00:18:06,723
All funny, funny ideas

180
00:18:06,923 --> 00:18:10,243
and anything funny and nonsensical that comes up,

181
00:18:10,483 --> 00:18:13,283
such funny brains picks it up.

182
00:18:13,483 --> 00:18:18,323
The other day I was telling a lady about her food,

183
00:18:18,683 --> 00:18:23,243
that a new idea has come that you should not eat any salt and sugar,

184
00:18:23,523 --> 00:18:26,243
I mean just imagine!

185
00:18:26,483 --> 00:18:30,363
Salt is so important for our breathing.

186
00:18:30,763 --> 00:18:32,643
If you ask any doctor, I mean,

187
00:18:32,843 --> 00:18:35,883
I don't know what's happening to the doctors!

188
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:40,763
And sugar is so important for our combustion.

189
00:18:41,043 --> 00:18:45,763
But anybody says anything you people just jump at it

190
00:18:46,003 --> 00:18:50,043
and you people just try to be

191
00:18:51,443 --> 00:18:54,803
impressed by all these ideas,

192
00:18:57,163 --> 00:19:00,763
and start torturing yourself.

193
00:19:01,443 --> 00:19:06,283
Last but not the least I feel now,

194
00:19:06,723 --> 00:19:10,523
I've seen the program on Gnostic,

195
00:19:10,763 --> 00:19:13,723
Gnostic  g-n-o.

196
00:19:14,003 --> 00:19:17,883
And I was thinking, it comes from where g-n-o?

197
00:19:18,163 --> 00:19:22,723
In Sanskrit language 'gnya', 'gnya' we call it.

198
00:19:23,003 --> 00:19:29,363
We call it gnya or gya, anyway, that means 'to know'.

199
00:19:29,803 --> 00:19:32,363
Gnostics means the one who knew.

200
00:19:32,563 --> 00:19:36,683
When St. Thomas came to India, He came via Egypt

201
00:19:36,883 --> 00:19:39,523
and He wrote all about it, what is to know.

202
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:42,923
And He said, it's a personal experience of everyone,

203
00:19:43,123 --> 00:19:46,243
just He described all Sahaja Yoga there.

204
00:19:46,443 --> 00:19:51,083
And also He said, why should God make you suffer?

205
00:19:51,283 --> 00:19:54,283
He is the most loving and affectionate father,

206
00:19:54,483 --> 00:19:58,323
blasting all ideas of Christianity.

207
00:19:59,483 --> 00:20:03,443
Also so many Hindus believe like that, Muslims believe like that,

208
00:20:03,643 --> 00:20:06,643
that you must suffer.

209
00:20:07,603 --> 00:20:14,643
So now somehow or other the exposure of the truth is also coming up,

210
00:20:15,523 --> 00:20:20,003
and also there is a kind of a turmoil going on,

211
00:20:20,283 --> 00:20:27,243
a kind, I would say a tremendous dynamic effects

212
00:20:27,763 --> 00:20:30,363
are seen on human mind today,

213
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:34,763
that it starts thinking: 'What is this?'

214
00:20:36,523 --> 00:20:39,403
And you are the answer.

215
00:20:39,883 --> 00:20:44,883
You are the one who is going to convince them.

216
00:20:46,403 --> 00:20:50,363
As somebody was saying that, “Mother, why not we make every year

217
00:20:50,563 --> 00:20:54,803
as a great year of propagation of Sahaja Yoga,

218
00:20:55,043 --> 00:20:58,083
propaganda of Sahaja Yoga, (Hindi word)?”

219
00:20:58,803 --> 00:21:01,803
I said, alright. You want to make a year,

220
00:21:02,003 --> 00:21:04,003
by that if something happens, let us have.

221
00:21:04,283 --> 00:21:06,763
But like our five-year plan in India

222
00:21:06,963 --> 00:21:09,523
I don't want to do all the documentation

223
00:21:09,723 --> 00:21:14,363
and write files and files and files, nothing comes out.

224
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:19,763
But today if you decide that

225
00:21:19,963 --> 00:21:23,563
we are the ones who have to manifest this greatness on this Earth.

226
00:21:23,803 --> 00:21:26,003
We are the ones who have to do all this.

227
00:21:26,203 --> 00:21:30,123
How can we be weak people? How can we be possessed people?

228
00:21:30,323 --> 00:21:32,403
How can we be fussy people?

229
00:21:32,603 --> 00:21:37,803
How can we be the people who are not saints?

230
00:21:41,603 --> 00:21:44,723
We have to come out of all our pettiness, all our conditionings

231
00:21:45,043 --> 00:21:47,123
and of all the things of our ego,

232
00:21:47,363 --> 00:21:53,083
but not to fight it but through meditation, through witness state.

233
00:21:53,323 --> 00:21:57,123
You have to be the witness now you are travelling.

234
00:21:57,323 --> 00:22:00,323
When you are travelling, normally the witness state

235
00:22:00,523 --> 00:22:03,323
is how to criticize something.

236
00:22:03,603 --> 00:22:06,483
They never see the good points, they'll say, “Oh, look at that,

237
00:22:06,683 --> 00:22:08,723
this colour should not have been used,

238
00:22:08,923 --> 00:22:11,243
that's not good, that's not good.”

239
00:22:11,483 --> 00:22:15,283
What is good is to be seen,

240
00:22:15,683 --> 00:22:20,363
what is good in you, how much good you can have

241
00:22:20,683 --> 00:22:25,203
and what is good in other people.

242
00:22:25,483 --> 00:22:31,123
This time I am telling you that on your way, on your tour,

243
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:34,763
I hope you will all enjoy it very much more

244
00:22:35,163 --> 00:22:39,283
and you’ll feel the manifestation of your Spirit,

245
00:22:39,523 --> 00:22:42,843
all around you, within you

246
00:22:43,123 --> 00:22:45,763
and in other people.

247
00:22:45,963 --> 00:22:48,883
May God bless you.

1
00:22:49,882 --> 00:22:52,154
Now I was aware of it all

2
00:22:52,502 --> 00:22:53,498
That

3
00:22:53,522 --> 00:22:54,998
One very big

4
00:22:55,506 --> 00:22:57,506
Revolution is happening

5
00:22:57,926 --> 00:22:59,624
And that's about it to London

6
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:01,079
I had very big lecture in London

7
00:23:01,975 --> 00:23:03,489
That revolution slowly

8
00:23:03,902 --> 00:23:05,729
It was happening
in a good manner

9
00:23:06,474 --> 00:23:08,914
But today she is
coming to your aid

10
00:23:10,414 --> 00:23:14,227
She stands in your head
and you are her opponent

11
00:23:15,869 --> 00:23:16,969
If anyone

12
00:23:17,941 --> 00:23:18,993
Became a Hindu

13
00:23:19,017 --> 00:23:21,564
So he takes the saffron
flag and goes to rent it

14
00:23:23,246 --> 00:23:24,264
If anyone

15
00:23:27,819 --> 00:23:29,621
Buddha became

16
00:23:29,811 --> 00:23:34,263
Know the Buddha

17
00:23:36,302 --> 00:23:39,337
The Buddha who received the light

18
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:43,652
But the one who considers us
Buddha takes on another flag

19
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,823
But in Sahajayoga

20
00:23:47,394 --> 00:23:49,394
He does not go out
with any flags.

21
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:52,893
It has its own focus.

22
00:23:54,972 --> 00:23:59,374
Now our first focus in India
is, 'My wife is not okay.

23
00:24:01,048 --> 00:24:03,048
My son has no job.

24
00:24:04,144 --> 00:24:07,812
My son has no job.

25
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:10,731
and

26
00:24:12,239 --> 00:24:15,295
After we left, our eyes were,

27
00:24:18,524 --> 00:24:21,642
You start looking around,

28
00:24:21,667 --> 00:24:23,667
So those eyes can see

29
00:24:24,706 --> 00:24:27,666
That is what we have
been doing till date

30
00:24:28,214 --> 00:24:29,210
How much it

31
00:24:31,368 --> 00:24:33,070
How poorly it is made.

32
00:24:33,998 --> 00:24:35,437
What a sight!

33
00:24:36,215 --> 00:24:37,823
where is our focous

34
00:24:38,918 --> 00:24:42,206
how can be so
comfortebal in such away

35
00:24:43,904 --> 00:24:44,520
Are you

36
00:24:44,972 --> 00:24:48,228
Yes, who wants to spread the
shadow all over the world

37
00:24:48,942 --> 00:24:52,288
And for all the world to enjoy,

38
00:24:53,264 --> 00:24:56,871
What kind of lights do they use!

39
00:24:59,513 --> 00:25:02,418
Just like the big light
houses on the sea,

40
00:25:02,925 --> 00:25:06,859
how can we do so
easily without you ?

41
00:25:08,415 --> 00:25:11,070
But there is also so little of it

42
00:25:12,212 --> 00:25:15,145
And sometimes I am very surprised
to see that insignificance.

43
00:25:17,485 --> 00:25:19,817
As I said to you
today, I tell you,

44
00:25:20,667 --> 00:25:23,911
That, for the sake of
marriage, girls or boys said,

45
00:25:24,172 --> 00:25:26,927
I want a girl only

46
00:25:27,418 --> 00:25:29,418
Only Maratha's
son should be seen

47
00:25:31,021 --> 00:25:34,014
then what will happen
when he freez ?

48
00:25:37,236 --> 00:25:40,070
Yours! Then, 'Mataji,
this is what happened and that's it

49
00:25:40,127 --> 00:25:41,221
Back to another cry

50
00:25:44,903 --> 00:25:47,759
Then our hope is Mataji
we cannot leave fast

51
00:25:48,655 --> 00:25:49,788
Then Die without food

52
00:25:51,629 --> 00:25:53,075
Why should you tell me

53
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:59,376
I believe it is best to
be comfortable in a meal.

54
00:25:59,423 --> 00:26:00,782
what is fasting ?

55
00:26:01,369 --> 00:26:04,619
There is a snake, or a
scorpion, that rode on a limb

56
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:10,237
Such trivial ones

57
00:26:10,808 --> 00:26:12,808
And extremely compressed

58
00:26:13,634 --> 00:26:16,221
Today people of our
country can make

59
00:26:16,221 --> 00:26:19,307
progress evenin
sahajayoga due to tendency

60
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:23,099
These people say, you are a saint.
Because you are so naive

61
00:26:23,124 --> 00:26:27,980
Such is their opinion. There will be.
You mean I have no disagreement.

62
00:26:29,043 --> 00:26:31,930
But Sahayogi is simply
naive and does not work.

63
00:26:34,731 --> 00:26:38,803
First, we need wisdom and
understanding that we have today

64
00:26:39,152 --> 00:26:40,663
Standing on the edge

65
00:26:45,044 --> 00:26:47,044
These petty ideas.

66
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:50,303
If we want to get married,
we will do it in our

67
00:26:50,328 --> 00:26:53,239
we are sahajayogi By the way,
we are comfortable with sahajayogi

68
00:26:53,532 --> 00:26:55,688
Will work The word 'walk'
is too much for you.

69
00:26:55,974 --> 00:26:58,083
ok anything will work .
so which are you ?

70
00:26:58,108 --> 00:27:00,128
which king you are,says
everything will work out!

71
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,521
But the word 'walk'
should go smoothly.

72
00:27:05,505 --> 00:27:06,619
What is going on ?

73
00:27:08,864 --> 00:27:12,340
Instead of saying
'okay' or 'okay,'

74
00:27:13,134 --> 00:27:15,134
isn't this all shivaji maharaj ?

75
00:27:18,911 --> 00:27:20,982
Let us take a look at
these things and see

76
00:27:20,982 --> 00:27:23,753
That we have come to Sahajayoga

77
00:27:23,754 --> 00:27:25,855
It's not just for selfish reasons

78
00:27:26,514 --> 00:27:29,485
That is what we came
to find ourselves

79
00:27:29,782 --> 00:27:31,945
For what the mothers
have given to the mother

80
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:34,085
That we should open
our hands to others

81
00:27:36,609 --> 00:27:39,685
And we should see that
people should enjoy it

82
00:27:40,756 --> 00:27:42,243
They should be given love

83
00:27:43,362 --> 00:27:45,661
But people with
narrow-mindedness

84
00:27:45,962 --> 00:27:51,059
How to cure, then go into the pain
of fun in the room, Mataji Maja

85
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:52,461
Pain in hand

86
00:27:53,016 --> 00:27:53,937
Will happen

87
00:27:55,286 --> 00:27:57,085
I got a job

88
00:27:57,195 --> 00:27:58,807
The hour went by

89
00:27:59,362 --> 00:28:00,548
Will happen

90
00:28:02,484 --> 00:28:05,838
Do you deserve to be under
the umbrella of your mother?

91
00:28:07,402 --> 00:28:08,237
Think about it

92
00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:10,959
Those fine ideas

93
00:28:11,411 --> 00:28:16,221
And apart from the contractions,
today I believe you are in the desert

94
00:28:17,967 --> 00:28:20,455
If you are wondering whether
fresh baked vegetables

95
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,919
have been cooked in the
house, then it will be hard

96
00:28:25,847 --> 00:28:27,847
That's your wackiness

97
00:28:28,965 --> 00:28:32,024
Increased views and hours
are mind-blowingly great

98
00:28:33,984 --> 00:28:36,538
You belong to this
religion of that religion

99
00:28:36,657 --> 00:28:38,308
We are not of any religion

100
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,355
Religion is ours

101
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:49,147
We belong to no one's religion

102
00:28:49,433 --> 00:28:52,459
We are yogis what religion
do we mother to religion

103
00:28:52,515 --> 00:28:55,397
With a bit of it those
who are practicing this

104
00:28:55,738 --> 00:28:57,534
Let the days of
snake-eating come now

105
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,634
Diagnostics Let
Your Kids Have Fun

106
00:29:03,396 --> 00:29:05,396
Many styling your

107
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,093
Cut out the bad ideas.

108
00:29:11,394 --> 00:29:14,583
Unless you eliminate
those petty ideas

109
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:16,458
by then

110
00:29:18,172 --> 00:29:22,718
If a kite is tie with
stone, it cannot fly

111
00:29:24,194 --> 00:29:25,327
Your flight

112
00:29:26,818 --> 00:29:27,613
Could not happen

113
00:29:29,009 --> 00:29:30,006
Just like our lives

114
00:29:30,609 --> 00:29:31,800
We are done

115
00:29:32,934 --> 00:29:33,899
In all

116
00:29:34,755 --> 00:29:36,084
In terms of content

117
00:29:36,973 --> 00:29:38,174
Sahajayoga  stands.

118
00:29:40,428 --> 00:29:42,060
And your All

119
00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:44,679
The kingdom of God is brought.

120
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,742
But it should be
worth sitting there.

121
00:29:48,931 --> 00:29:50,653
Thoughts should be independent

122
00:29:51,161 --> 00:29:54,983
Thinking that I got into
this clan I thought something

123
00:29:55,165 --> 00:29:57,165
Maratha of 96 clan

124
00:29:57,355 --> 00:29:58,901
Or I become brahmin

125
00:30:00,814 --> 00:30:02,814
Content is all over us

126
00:30:04,934 --> 00:30:05,863
liar again.

127
00:30:06,092 --> 00:30:07,045
With credit

128
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,640
Ashamed of sahajayogi

129
00:30:12,584 --> 00:30:14,037
I am sahajayogi

130
00:30:14,473 --> 00:30:15,769
I'm free.

131
00:30:16,538 --> 00:30:19,764
I'm on the alert.
You told me something

132
00:30:20,386 --> 00:30:21,788
And I'm not gonna do it

133
00:30:22,542 --> 00:30:24,542
I stand at liberty

134
00:30:24,915 --> 00:30:26,915
I have autocorrect enabled

135
00:30:27,208 --> 00:30:28,821
You don't teach me anything

136
00:30:33,471 --> 00:30:35,630
Get away from all relations

137
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:40,745
You will not be able to come up
like lotus until you swallow it all

138
00:30:41,324 --> 00:30:44,957
Until then your anything
No use and no fun

139
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:52,139
Now, if we have a
campaign like this

140
00:30:55,647 --> 00:31:00,552
In Pune, Come at Savarkar Statue

141
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,724
so what you do there ?

142
00:31:06,842 --> 00:31:08,403
So there were
thousands of people

143
00:31:09,768 --> 00:31:11,113
Unpleasantness

144
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,648
If you want to teach

145
00:31:12,648 --> 00:31:14,898
Thousands of people will leave

146
00:31:15,107 --> 00:31:16,499
Run away

147
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:18,747
Because there is Unpleasantness

148
00:31:21,072 --> 00:31:23,072
But in the court of love

149
00:31:23,865 --> 00:31:25,865
Get rid of it all.

150
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:31,036
It is not ready.
All of this wears off in the dirt

151
00:31:35,487 --> 00:31:37,487
By breaking into this paradigm

152
00:31:39,051 --> 00:31:41,051
Stand in Sahajayoga

153
00:31:41,883 --> 00:31:43,395
It should not weak

154
00:31:44,633 --> 00:31:46,270
It should be strong

155
00:31:47,357 --> 00:31:48,352
This is new

156
00:31:48,852 --> 00:31:50,852
Such people should
be raised today

157
00:31:51,566 --> 00:31:55,533
thousands of mahatma gandhi
Thousands of lenin were raised

158
00:31:58,972 --> 00:32:01,657
thousands of like Abraham Lincoln
were raise like People should say

159
00:32:03,022 --> 00:32:04,606
But there is no difference

160
00:32:05,812 --> 00:32:08,482
That is what the nose,
the mouth and the feet are like

161
00:32:09,505 --> 00:32:11,505
Just look at how far the
soul has reached the light

162
00:32:14,227 --> 00:32:18,374
And we are saints,
we are saints.

163
00:32:19,405 --> 00:32:21,405
All this is a disorder

164
00:32:22,849 --> 00:32:24,849
It's a stigma for us

165
00:32:25,515 --> 00:32:30,669
We will break it down,religion and
all and forget about everything

166
00:32:31,946 --> 00:32:34,055
Unless you decide to

167
00:32:34,468 --> 00:32:36,468
You will not benefit at
all in the sahajayoga

168
00:32:37,062 --> 00:32:39,062
And for us too, it's Trouble

169
00:32:42,855 --> 00:32:44,289
Let's get bigger

170
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,360
The sea went anywhere

171
00:32:47,764 --> 00:32:49,119
That nobody is in the mind

172
00:32:49,563 --> 00:32:52,274
That is our sea of Alibaug

173
00:32:54,052 --> 00:32:55,650
or is a Mumbai sea

174
00:32:56,705 --> 00:32:58,311
The ocean is ocean

175
00:32:58,668 --> 00:33:00,267
Such a saint is a saint

176
00:33:01,504 --> 00:33:03,198
Which is a sign of saint and

177
00:33:03,832 --> 00:33:06,749
The main symptom of this
is that apprehension

178
00:33:07,203 --> 00:33:08,616
Artificial

179
00:33:09,648 --> 00:33:12,898
Beyond the artificial
small shrines

180
00:33:13,835 --> 00:33:15,035
Their vision is relaxed

181
00:33:15,685 --> 00:33:17,036
Very endearing

182
00:33:19,988 --> 00:33:24,916
At that time as a call for
cooperation, the whole world refuses

183
00:33:25,717 --> 00:33:27,379
The key is how we
become what you are

184
00:33:29,426 --> 00:33:31,426
We are gonna do
whatever you want

185
00:33:32,235 --> 00:33:34,727
We are this we are that

186
00:33:35,647 --> 00:33:37,136
Who are you lets see

187
00:33:38,318 --> 00:33:40,318
So what do we do

188
00:33:42,548 --> 00:33:45,230
Just get rid of this
illusion of stupidity

189
00:33:46,397 --> 00:33:48,397
You can remove
this with kundalini

190
00:33:48,849 --> 00:33:51,817
Today they are cheearing
me for Adi Shakti ,so do it

191
00:33:53,126 --> 00:33:55,647
What happen with it but
what is the benefit.

192
00:33:58,805 --> 00:34:00,152
If ours

193
00:34:00,731 --> 00:34:01,806
In cheers

194
00:34:02,876 --> 00:34:04,330
You forget all

195
00:34:05,028 --> 00:34:07,028
Are under our mother's feet

196
00:34:07,861 --> 00:34:10,030
And this universe is made by her

197
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:15,599
We are special sahajayogi
from that world

198
00:34:16,234 --> 00:34:17,838
If you think about it

199
00:34:19,012 --> 00:34:21,012
Then your own
perception will change

200
00:34:21,615 --> 00:34:22,796
And about self

201
00:34:23,279 --> 00:34:25,029
Whichever is wrong ideas

202
00:34:25,386 --> 00:34:26,745
they fix it

203
00:34:27,094 --> 00:34:28,301
Among themselves

204
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:29,724
love

205
00:34:31,176 --> 00:34:34,465
Not only that, but huge power

206
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:37,485
One is living among themselves

207
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:38,567
Be aware of that

208
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,400
And we with a great power

209
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:43,040
Come together

210
00:34:43,405 --> 00:34:44,677
And with this power

211
00:34:45,121 --> 00:34:47,121
You will notice that
We are about to be saved

212
00:34:50,435 --> 00:34:53,690
Today some hindi language
known people who has come so

213
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:59,914
I always told to Marathi people
That you try to learn Hindi

214
00:34:59,914 --> 00:35:02,902
Because its your
national language but

215
00:35:02,902 --> 00:35:04,405
Will have to say to
Hindi people also

216
00:35:04,406 --> 00:35:07,412
Is it good to learn
a little Marathi

217
00:35:07,412 --> 00:35:13,160
Although I think that The Marathi
language is a bit too powerful

218
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:18,157
And its depth can not come in
any language okey leave Sanskrit

219
00:35:18,181 --> 00:35:21,662
After this any
Colloquial language has

220
00:35:21,662 --> 00:35:28,280
For Kundalini Marathi language
is very smooth and very

221
00:35:31,535 --> 00:35:32,872
In use

222
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:36,475
However, the place of
Hindi language is very high

223
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,658
and ever Marathi people
should know Hindi language

224
00:35:39,658 --> 00:35:41,789
Similarly, you people also
have a Marathi Language

225
00:35:41,813 --> 00:35:43,661
learning should not be difficult

226
00:35:43,662 --> 00:35:47,658
What am I talking about today

227
00:35:47,658 --> 00:35:50,408
That of the big revolution
We stand on the post

228
00:35:50,408 --> 00:35:56,406
Right now in front of us
It is a big request that

229
00:35:57,099 --> 00:36:01,349
We are sahajayogi
Have earned yoga

230
00:36:01,662 --> 00:36:08,406
we are not like that Which
are full of dirty thoughts

231
00:36:08,406 --> 00:36:11,108
Who do not love each other

232
00:36:11,132 --> 00:36:15,356
and one Have violent
tendencies towards each other

233
00:36:15,408 --> 00:36:19,905
We are yogis We gonna
join all over the world

234
00:36:19,905 --> 00:36:24,160
We are especially representative

235
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:29,719
And we are saints and the
characteristics of saints

236
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:32,972
Its in us Must seen

237
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:36,459
When it show everyone

238
00:36:36,459 --> 00:36:39,456
It will be understood that
Sahaja Yoga is a special thing

239
00:36:39,932 --> 00:36:42,408
Otherwise people will think
that your sahajayogi then what?

240
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:45,163
Your habits are the same
Your ways are the same

241
00:36:45,163 --> 00:36:49,659
You fight likewise The
group bet is the same in you

242
00:36:49,659 --> 00:36:52,161
All your values
Like that of others

243
00:36:52,161 --> 00:36:55,161
So what about Sahaja Yoga?

244
00:36:55,161 --> 00:36:59,660
In Sahaja Yoga we have
externally Received nothing

245
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:04,158
But the strong power
inside We live in

246
00:37:04,562 --> 00:37:10,059
And all our world
have this power today

247
00:37:10,059 --> 00:37:14,061
See that The power is
inhabited by all of us.

248
00:37:14,061 --> 00:37:20,556
It is roaming inside us Her
beautiful environment inside

249
00:37:20,556 --> 00:37:23,039
Made up and mutual
love and we know

250
00:37:23,386 --> 00:37:30,635
Not so much, every
moment, Power feeds us

251
00:37:30,635 --> 00:37:33,782
Binds us to each other

252
00:37:33,893 --> 00:37:38,028
This power is the formula of
the whole world that we got

253
00:37:38,028 --> 00:37:43,526
And when we found it We
do such useless things

254
00:37:43,526 --> 00:37:49,030
Of course Ready to destroy life

255
00:37:49,235 --> 00:37:54,734
We have to evaluate ourselves Will
have to know what is our value

256
00:37:54,734 --> 00:37:58,490
And what did we
understand our life

257
00:38:00,492 --> 00:38:02,239
I see that

258
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:05,236
To quarrel is a human nature

259
00:38:05,236 --> 00:38:07,735
Whatever happens to
him They start fighting

260
00:38:07,735 --> 00:38:10,986
Like this with dog
cat I am not even seen

261
00:38:11,488 --> 00:38:13,987
If anything happens It
becomes a matter of quarrel

262
00:38:13,987 --> 00:38:19,238
Even if love is something
Sahaja Yoga is only for love

263
00:38:20,487 --> 00:38:24,327
Movement just love movement

264
00:38:24,351 --> 00:38:27,081
And you are sitting
in the same movement

265
00:38:27,489 --> 00:38:35,239
A very beautiful and very sweet
This is the environment I travel to

266
00:38:36,721 --> 00:38:41,467
But it can happen when
your subtlety Be so deep

267
00:38:41,842 --> 00:38:48,091
That we can see that we are
representative of divine

268
00:38:48,711 --> 00:38:52,708
Divine doing this job
from us What a great thing

269
00:38:52,837 --> 00:38:55,339
To achieve this unique thing

270
00:38:55,339 --> 00:39:01,337
You need to be aware of yourself
Be and be your own personality

271
00:39:01,337 --> 00:39:05,057
Give her such a
huge strain Tease

272
00:39:05,057 --> 00:39:09,086
Today is the first day
When everyone has come

273
00:39:09,086 --> 00:39:13,587
See how well everyone is sitting It is
a matter of great pride for a mother.

274
00:39:13,587 --> 00:39:16,587
That all my children here
are gathered from the world

275
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:24,836
But every time I want
that you become aware

276
00:39:24,836 --> 00:39:28,088
You have to know that Mother
is doing very big revolution

277
00:39:42,774 --> 00:39:44,330
You guys

278
00:39:45,409 --> 00:39:47,409
Watch you wake up

279
00:39:47,845 --> 00:39:49,845
That our mother

280
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,290
That is a very big achievement

281
00:39:51,964 --> 00:39:53,964
Which will wipe out all the universe

282
00:39:55,075 --> 00:39:57,607
This is a very big achievement

283
00:39:58,305 --> 00:40:00,305
Is doing and you

284
00:40:00,598 --> 00:40:02,199
We are in limbo.

285
00:40:03,951 --> 00:40:09,036
May god bless you
