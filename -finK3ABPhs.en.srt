1
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,600
Welcome to all of you.

2
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:57,280
This great country is also passing through a crisis.

3
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,560
Nowadays I feel there are so many things that are happening

4
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,880
which you could never dream before.

5
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,040
And at this time you all have arrived

6
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,840
bringing peace and joy to all of them.

7
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,680
So I thank you for that.

8
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,560
The strife and the strain which is on human beings is

9
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:42,920
perhaps because they are not yet worthy of God's blessings.

10
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,440
Still, as God has created them,

11
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,880
He tries to do His utmost

12
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,240
to see that human beings are kept comfortably

13
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,520
alright on this Mother Earth.

14
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,400
He creates all kinds of beautiful things as you see

15
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,440
and the whole cosmos is in unison

16
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,320
and working out something very great today.

17
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,360
This new revolution that has started,

18
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,040
very, very silently,

19
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,440
today is taking it's shape

20
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:28,840
and is providing a new future for all of us.

21
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,320
You see those big, big trees, that are on top of your head

22
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,480
and as long as you are sitting here no fruit will fall upon you.

23
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,040
It's not because I am here

24
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,000
but because this Mother Earth knows

25
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,840
that there are such great saints sitting here

26
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,760
and She is not going to disturb.

27
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,880
This place was called as Shrigaav I was told,

28
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:06,600
means the village of the Goddess.

29
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,800
And this fruit is called as Shriphal,

30
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,760
meaning the fruit of the Goddess.

31
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:20,400
But actually if you see, a coconut is something like our Sahasrara

32
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:28,560
and is very auspicious because it can absorb lot of vibrations,

33
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,000
as if it has got its realization.

34
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,080
As you people can absorb My vibrations,

35
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:41,280
this fruit can absorb also My vibrations,

36
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,280
in the greatest amount.

37
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,480
So we are here today

38
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,360
in a very big way

39
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:05,200
to advertise the coming of the New Age.

40
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,240
The coming of

41
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,239
the Golden Era, people have talked about.

42
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,120
Here we are to say

43
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:27,160
what is reality, what is truth, what is joy.

44
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:33,400
Here we are to manifest that and also

45
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:43,600
to create a commotion or a movement

46
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:51,200
in the cosmos so that this new awareness

47
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,400
is established in the cosmos

48
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,040
which will enlighten this country

49
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,040
and the people of this country.

50
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:09,840
Also you will pick up the threads of this movement within yourself

51
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:15,000
which is a very subtle movement going on.

52
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,440
At this moment we are in a strife of an intellectual

53
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:25,440
who tried to describe

54
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:30,880
Shri Rama and Shri Krishna, in a slurring manner.

55
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:38,200
And this is the time I want to bring your attention

56
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:46,600
that if this intellectual strife to use the intelligence

57
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:53,080
to bring down all the ideals which enlighten our path,

58
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,800
which gives us the guideline and an aspiration,

59
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:05,320
then our lives become absolutely mundane, useless, joyless.

60
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:12,369
It's very easy to condemn an ideal life,

61
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,360
but to attain that life is very difficult.

62
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,760
And some people, because they cannot attain it,

63
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:28,640
try to condemn it so that they feel that they are no less,

64
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,720
no way less than those great lives.

65
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,240
All these ideals are created, these images are created,

66
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:46,280
everywhere in the world by the Divine power

67
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,720
and people look at them

68
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:59,200
and think that these great lives are beautiful,

69
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:05,920
though they have suffered a lot, but there is so much of

70
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,400
deeper understanding

71
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:18,560
and deeper balancing and a deeper love.

72
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:28,320
These ideals are very important for human societies

73
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,240
otherwise they will be absolutely living in a relatively

74
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:38,480
and they will have no absolute measure

75
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,920
to find out what is right and what is wrong.

76
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,200
In Sahaja Yoga we are here first of all

77
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,840
to get connected with God Almighty,

78
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,160
with His power, the All-Pervading Power of Chaitanya.

79
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,840
By that we become our own master,

80
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:06,640
in the sense that we get our own guidelines.

81
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,080
If some Sahaja Yogi has not achieved that much

82
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,120
then is a serious thing.

83
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,120
At least a Sahaja Yogi should be able to see,

84
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:22,080
at the minimum of minimum, what is wrong with that person.

85
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:32,840
To cleanse yourself and to put yourself right is of course,

86
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:40,160
is a very important duty of every Sahaja Yogi.

87
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,120
But these things are not to be taken

88
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,639
as condemnation of yourself by any chance.

89
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,640
And you should not be identified with those problems that you have

90
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:57,156
but try to face them and cure them.

91
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,760
Many a times I have heard Sahaja Yogis saying

92
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,360
that Indians are very simple people

93
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,600
they are not complicated, Mother,

94
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:11,640
so they can achieve their ascent much faster.

95
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:19,920
But it's not that. It is very different for all of you, very much.

96
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,640
And despite all the complications, and all kinds of brain washing,

97
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,280
and all kinds of book reading and all kinds of so-called seeking,

98
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,680
and all that nonsense one has gone through,

99
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,560
you have come out of it,

100
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,920
you have washed yourself completely

101
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:44,360
and today you are there united together to face

102
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,320
all that is absurd,

103
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:51,200
all that is false, all that is wrong.

104
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,760
It has to be a very formidable army for us

105
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,480
because if you see around, even in this country,

106
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,720
you call it not complicated,

107
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,640
there are many who are all the time to complicate others

108
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:15,520
and to destroy all their ideals, destroy all their visions

109
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:21,040
and brainwash them.

110
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:26,160
So you have to be very alert yourself

111
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,520
and you have to be very conscious,

112
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:36,720
that it is you who is going to build up this great image

113
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:41,760
of ideal people,

114
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:48,600
not one ideal life but ideal people in all collectivities.

115
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,800
Now on your way to our tour,

116
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:01,040
you are now on the threshold of entering into a new dimension,

117
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,600
it is a subtler dimension,

118
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:10,095
and this subtler dimension is within ourselves.

119
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:17,280
And there lies your own being as your Spirit.

120
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,400
It sees you as separate,

121
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,880
your Self is separate from yourself.

122
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:32,000
All these identifications have to be dropped out,

123
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,800
all kinds of misidentifications.

124
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,720
I was reading one of the marriages lists and all that,

125
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,240
somebody says that they will marry Indians,

126
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,760
some say we will not marry Indians,

127
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,120
some say, we will not change the country,

128
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,240
some say they will change the country.

129
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:03,280
Even after Sahaja Yoga (...)

130
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,800
if we stick on to one country as our own

131
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:13,600
then I must say that we have to give up those limitations.

132
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:20,080
The time has come. Of course you have the choice.

133
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,440
Nobody is going to force you to do anything

134
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:29,480
but it also expresses your personality

135
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:37,320
that you still are lingering on to these small, small limitations.

136
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,120
As I have told you many a times

137
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,560
God created only one world.

138
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:51,640
Of course He created varieties just to create beauty.

139
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,880
But how blind we are

140
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:01,000
that we think we are different people,

141
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:05,920
we are of different countries, of different races,

142
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:12,200
of different castes, communities, cities -

143
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:19,240
then little, little rows, then houses.

144
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:26,920
I would say we become from human beings to rats and rats to worms

145
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:32,360
and then I don't know what is the situation later .

146
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:37,960
Let's open our heart, let's become great,

147
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,400
we have to be like lions,

148
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:47,560
not to be small and creepy people like worms.

149
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,320
There are many worms everywhere in the world.

150
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:56,360
We are specially chosen people to be something great.

151
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,800
So open your heart. That's the main problem.

152
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,200
This ego covers the heart

153
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,920
and makes you feel that, “Now I am an Indian, I am a Christian,

154
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,080
I am this thing, I am that thing.”

155
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:23,480
Now if I say to someone that you are not to go to temple,

156
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,480
then I must be

157
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:33,200
a very cruel person to say that not to go to a temple.

158
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,080
But they go to a temple and come back with such a big

159
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:47,360
entity on their heads.

160
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,960
Then they go to churches.

161
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,440
The other day I had a very bad experience of a lady

162
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:58,320
who went to a church in France

163
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,600
and she has become

164
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:05,720
something like a minister, maybe something like a pope.

165
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:11,080
I mean something very funny you know, nothing normal.

166
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:15,640
I couldn't discover it, when I asked she said, “I went to a church.”

167
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:20,480
“Why?”
“Because they arranged a marriage there." “Why?”

168
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,080
“Oh, they wanted to have a big social event

169
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,040
so they wanted to have a marriage.”

170
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,480
But you could just have a registered marriage, finish it off.

171
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,760
Why do you want to go to a church, where all dead bodies are buried?

172
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,920
To get back some of them on your heads?

173
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,960
So we have to be prepared to

174
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,960
give up all the shackles of nonsense from our heads.

175
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,640
All kinds of things there are, so much of conditionings

176
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,080
come down even to the colour scheme,

177
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,760
then it's all conditioning.

178
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,720
This is too much, not good!

179
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,800
All funny, funny ideas

180
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,320
and anything funny and nonsensical that comes up,

181
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,360
such funny brains picks it up.

182
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:18,400
The other day I was telling a lady about her food,

183
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:23,320
that a new idea has come that you should not eat any salt and sugar,

184
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,320
I mean just imagine!

185
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:30,440
Salt is so important for our breathing.

186
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,720
If you ask any doctor, I mean,

187
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,960
I don't know what's happening to the doctors!

188
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,840
And sugar is so important for our combustion.

189
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,840
But anybody says anything you people just jump at it

190
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,120
and you people just try to be

191
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,880
impressed by all these ideas,

192
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,840
and start torturing yourself.

193
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,360
Last but not the least I feel now,

194
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,600
I've seen the program on Gnostic,

195
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,800
Gnostic  g-n-o.

196
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,960
And I was thinking, it comes from where g-n-o?

197
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,800
In Sanskrit language 'gnya', 'gnya' we call it.

198
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:29,440
We call it gnya or gya, anyway, that means 'to know'.

199
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,440
Gnostics means the one who knew.

200
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,760
When St. Thomas came to India, He came via Egypt

201
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,600
and He wrote all about it, what is to know.

202
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,000
And He said, it's a personal experience of everyone,

203
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,320
just He described all Sahaja Yoga there.

204
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:51,160
And also He said, why should God make you suffer?

205
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,360
He is the most loving and affectionate father,

206
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:58,400
blasting all ideas of Christianity.

207
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:03,520
Also so many Hindus believe like that, Muslims believe like that,

208
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,720
that you must suffer.

209
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:14,720
So now somehow or other the exposure of the truth is also coming up,

210
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,080
and also there is a kind of a turmoil going on,

211
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:27,320
a kind, I would say a tremendous dynamic effects

212
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,440
are seen on human mind today,

213
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,840
that it starts thinking: 'What is this?'

214
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,480
And you are the answer.

215
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:44,960
You are the one who is going to convince them.

216
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,440
As somebody was saying that, “Mother, why not we make every year

217
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,880
as a great year of propagation of Sahaja Yoga,

218
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,160
propaganda of Sahaja Yoga, (Hindi word)?”

219
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,880
I said, alright. You want to make a year,

220
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,080
by that if something happens, let us have.

221
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,840
But like our five-year plan in India

222
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,600
I don't want to do all the documentation

223
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:14,440
and write files and files and files, nothing comes out.

224
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,840
But today if you decide that

225
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,640
we are the ones who have to manifest this greatness on this Earth.

226
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,080
We are the ones who have to do all this.

227
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:30,200
How can we be weak people? How can we be possessed people?

228
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,480
How can we be fussy people?

229
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:37,880
How can we be the people who are not saints?

230
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,800
We have to come out of all our pettiness, all our conditionings

231
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,200
and of all the things of our ego,

232
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:53,160
but not to fight it but through meditation, through witness state.

233
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,200
You have to be the witness now you are travelling.

234
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,400
When you are travelling, normally the witness state

235
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,400
is how to criticize something.

236
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,560
They never see the good points, they'll say, “Oh, look at that,

237
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,800
this colour should not have been used,

238
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,320
that's not good, that's not good.”

239
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:15,360
What is good is to be seen,

240
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,440
what is good in you, how much good you can have

241
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:25,280
and what is good in other people.

242
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:31,200
This time I am telling you that on your way, on your tour,

243
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,840
I hope you will all enjoy it very much more

244
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:39,360
and you’ll feel the manifestation of your Spirit,

245
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,920
all around you, within you

246
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,840
and in other people.

247
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,960
May God bless you.
