00:00:06.033 --> 00:00:10.433
It is good that all Sahaja Yogis have come together. When we meet like this,

00:00:10.553 --> 00:00:13.433
we can discuss many things of mutual interest

00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:18.513
and tell even small details about them to each other

00:00:18.593 --> 00:00:34.513
how to clean yourself as your Mother’s name itself is Nirmala and it contains many powers.

00:00:35.513 --> 00:00:45.353
The first word is NIH which means not.

00:00:45.433 --> 00:00:51.273
Something that actually does not exist but appears to exist, is called Mahamaya (illusion).

00:00:51.353 --> 00:00:54.313
In fact it is not there

00:00:54.393 --> 00:00:59.393
but we feel it exists and this is called Mahamaya

00:00:59.593 --> 00:01:03.073
and the whole world is like that.

00:01:03.153 --> 00:01:10.113
It is seen but it is not true:

00:01:10.193 --> 00:01:16.113
if we are trapped into it we feel that it is the only thing we have to live for

00:01:16.193 --> 00:01:19.553
Then we feel that economic conditions are unsatisfactory,

00:01:19.633 --> 00:01:23.073
social and domestic (family) conditions are bad,

00:01:23.153 --> 00:01:28.793
everything around us is bad and we cannot see anything good.

00:01:28.873 --> 00:01:39.513
Water on the sea surface is very dirty and turbid.

00:01:39.593 --> 00:01:43.233
Many objects are seen floating on it. But if we go deep into the sea

00:01:43.313 --> 00:01:52.433
there is so much beauty, wealth and power that we forget that on the surface the water is so bad.

00:01:52.513 --> 00:01:56.433
The point is that everything that you see around is illusion.

00:01:56.513 --> 00:02:01.913
You must remember first of all it is all nothing.

00:02:01.993 --> 00:02:08.393
If you have to establish ‘NIH’ you have to tell yourself,not this

00:02:08.473 --> 00:02:15.033
whenever a thought comes, say “not this

00:02:15.113 --> 00:02:21.033
“not this (ya neti neti vachane nigamor avochus)

00:02:21.113 --> 00:02:26.073
another thought comes, say it is not there.

00:02:26.153 --> 00:02:28.073
You have to say this again and again.

00:02:28.153 --> 00:02:34.313
You have to say this again and again. Then you will understand the meaning of word ‘NIH’.

00:02:34.393 --> 00:02:40.353
The illusion that you see is not just the illusion,

00:02:40.433 --> 00:02:46.353
but there is something beyond that.

00:02:46.433 --> 00:02:51.393
However, we have wasted so many years of lives in these illusions

00:02:51.473 --> 00:02:57.313
that we give importance to all that actually does not exist

00:02:57.393 --> 00:03:06.113
and in doing that we have made heaps of sins.

00:03:06.193 --> 00:03:13.673
We have tried to derive the pleasure from many things.

00:03:13.753 --> 00:03:26.473
We have received nothing from whatever we have tried to enjoy.

00:03:26.553 --> 00:03:30.433
Essentially, it is all nothing – tasteless.

00:03:31.553 --> 00:03:36.993
So, the outlook should be,

00:03:37.073 --> 00:03:41.753
it is all that nothing, it is all false. Only Brahma is real the rest all is false

00:03:41.833 --> 00:03:44.633
You have to adopt this view point everywhere in life.

00:03:44.713 --> 00:03:47.993
Then you will understand the true meaning of Sahaja Yoga

00:03:48.073 --> 00:03:51.113
What happens with most of the Sahaja Yogis after realisation

00:03:51.193 --> 00:03:54.793
is that they think, “now that we are realised we have Mataji’s blessings.

00:03:54.873 --> 00:03:57.233
Then why are we not prosperous?”.

00:03:57.313 --> 00:04:00.633
That means they think God is in the prosperity

00:04:00.713 --> 00:04:07.073
Inspite of having our realization why our family conditions do not improve?

00:04:07.153 --> 00:04:14.073
Instead, you should think that, inspite of the realization why my temperament (swabhav) has not changed.

00:04:14.153 --> 00:04:17.953
Then you’ll realise that my swabhav has not changed

00:04:18.033 --> 00:04:20.593
See, how beautiful is this word ‘Swabhav’ –

00:04:20.673 --> 00:04:23.993
‘Swa’ is Atman i.e. the spirit and bhav is the nature.

00:04:24.073 --> 00:04:26.793
Have you become the nature of your Self ?

00:04:26.873 --> 00:04:33.153
If you become your self there is so much beauty within,

00:04:33.233 --> 00:04:37.673
that all that goes on outside would appear like drama

00:04:37.753 --> 00:04:39.713
So long as this witness state

00:04:39.793 --> 00:04:43.993
So long as this witness state is not fully awakened within you,

00:04:44.073 --> 00:04:49.233
you have not followed the word ‘NIH’ and also you have not practised it

00:04:49.313 --> 00:05:00.313
and even now you become s emotional or egoistical

00:05:00.393 --> 00:05:09.193
coercive or submissive and feel sad about it,

00:05:09.313 --> 00:05:13.593
then the state of being on ‘NIH’ is at the centre of these extremes.

00:05:13.673 --> 00:05:17.153
You are neither in this state nor in that.

00:05:17.233 --> 00:05:20.033
This state has to be established

00:05:20.113 --> 00:05:22.393
and it can be best achieved in meditation.

00:05:22.473 --> 00:05:29.073
Just by following the idea of ‘NIH’ in your life you will become (Nirvichar) thoughtless.

00:05:29.233 --> 00:05:33.113
First of all, you should become thoughtless

00:05:33.193 --> 00:05:45.553
Once you start jumping on a thought however good or bad it may be,

00:05:45.633 --> 00:05:59.113
you go into some sort of inertia and in that state you jump from one thought to another

00:05:59.193 --> 00:06:06.633
. So some people have said that a bad thought should be opposed by a good thought.

00:06:06.713 --> 00:06:12.553
In other words if a vehicle or train coming from one direction,

00:06:12.633 --> 00:06:16.033
is pushed back by another one, both will stop somewhere at the centre.

00:06:16.113 --> 00:06:17.673
It is good

00:06:17.753 --> 00:06:19.673
but occasionally it can become harmful.

00:06:19.753 --> 00:06:27.313
A bad thought when put down by a good thought remains suppressed

00:06:27.393 --> 00:06:36.833
but it can suddenly come up and it happens with many people.

00:06:36.913 --> 00:06:39.113
. They press down their normal thoughts

00:06:39.193 --> 00:06:44.873
and always tell themselves that they must be good to others and must be well behaved etc.

00:06:44.953 --> 00:06:49.553
These people can sometimes be in trouble

00:06:49.633 --> 00:06:53.313
Suddenly they get exasperated and others cannot understand,

00:06:53.393 --> 00:06:57.513
why these well behaved people are annoyed.

00:06:57.593 --> 00:07:01.993
Also they lose their inner peace.

00:07:02.073 --> 00:07:05.513
All the beauty within them is destroyed.

00:07:05.593 --> 00:07:08.513
So we should be always thoughtless.

00:07:08.593 --> 00:07:10.993
Ban all thoughts from your mind

00:07:11.073 --> 00:07:16.433
and then you would automatically remain at the centre in the Vilamba.

00:07:16.513 --> 00:07:19.113
You must make all efforts

00:07:19.193 --> 00:07:27.873
Now you would ask “Mother how can we do anything without thinking?”

00:07:27.953 --> 00:07:31.233
But what are thoughts? They are hollow.

00:07:32.953 --> 00:07:40.393
In thoughtless state you are one with the God’s power

00:07:40.473 --> 00:07:45.673
that is, the drop, which is you, comes in the ocean which is God.

00:07:45.753 --> 00:07:49.913
Hence His power also comes to you. Does this finger think?

00:07:49.993 --> 00:07:51.953
Is it not still moving?

00:07:53.113 --> 00:07:57.673
Give your thoughts to God

00:07:57.753 --> 00:07:59.393
and ask Him to think about you.

00:07:59.473 --> 00:08:02.873
But it is rather difficult, because you are not thoughtless.

00:08:02.953 --> 00:08:09.993
Many people say “we have surrendered everything”, but it does not happen

00:08:10.073 --> 00:08:13.233
because they do it only in talking.

00:08:13.313 --> 00:08:15.633
Surrendering is not just talking.

00:08:15.713 --> 00:08:17.553
When you attain thoughtlessness then surrendering is automatic .

00:08:17.633 --> 00:08:19.713
That is you have stopped thinking.

00:08:19.793 --> 00:08:24.113
When you stop thinking you come to the centre.

00:08:24.193 --> 00:08:29.753
When at the centre, immediately you go into thoughtless awareness, i.e. become one with God’s power

00:08:29.833 --> 00:08:38.273
and when you are one with the God’s power, He looks after you

00:08:38.353 --> 00:08:41.193
He takes care of your small things also. You will be amazed.

00:08:41.273 --> 00:08:43.713
Sometimes try doing things on your own

00:08:43.873 --> 00:08:48.353
Then you’ll experience “Sankalpa vikalpa karoti” (Man proposes and God disposes).

00:08:48.433 --> 00:08:52.833
If you want to go through a particular way, try doing it.

00:08:52.913 --> 00:09:03.153
All the countries have tried it and failed.

00:09:03.233 --> 00:09:15.153
It is worth trying and after that you will realise that what you were doing earlier was wrong.

00:09:15.233 --> 00:09:22.913
So once you are in thoughtlessness you will get all inspirations, all powers and everything.

00:09:27.993 --> 00:09:37.153
The idea that you get in thoughtlessness is an inspiration.

00:09:37.313 --> 00:09:42.313
You will be surprised. Everything will come to you as if on a plate.

00:09:42.393 --> 00:09:47.593
You are standing to give a speech. Just be thoughtless and start.

00:09:47.673 --> 00:09:54.313
Although you have never given a speech earlier

00:09:54.393 --> 00:09:57.873
or do not even know how to do it

00:09:57.953 --> 00:10:01.233
or have no special knowledge of any subject

00:10:01.313 --> 00:10:06.673
you will speak so well that others will be astonished how you know so much.

00:10:07.033 --> 00:10:10.353
But once you are deep in the thoughtless state,

00:10:10.433 --> 00:10:14.233
all comes from there and not from your brain.

00:10:16.193 --> 00:10:19.393
I tell you about Me.

00:10:19.473 --> 00:10:23.433
You pray ‘Mother kindly see that such and such happens to me’

00:10:23.513 --> 00:10:25.513
and I do not think about that.

00:10:25.593 --> 00:10:28.833
It is amazing. I put all that in the thoughtlessness.

00:10:28.913 --> 00:10:38.953
All machinery is working there

00:10:39.033 --> 00:10:43.073
Just put it to that machinery and it is all ready.

00:10:43.153 --> 00:10:49.473
Allow that machinery, you can call it silent machinery, to work.

00:10:49.553 --> 00:10:53.313
silent machinery, to work. You should put all your problems to it.

00:10:53.393 --> 00:10:56.673
But it is very difficult for intellectuals

00:10:56.753 --> 00:10:59.393
because their habit is to go on thinking about everything

00:10:59.473 --> 00:11:04.273
You should be able to go into thoughtlessness while trying to understand a subject.

00:11:04.353 --> 00:11:08.193
All becomes clear automatically

00:11:08.273 --> 00:11:12.913
Research that you are doing should also be in thoughtless state.

00:11:12.993 --> 00:11:17.073
Let your hands work while you are thoughtless.

00:11:17.153 --> 00:11:22.553
You can do your research extremely well in this way. I tell you many things.

00:11:22.633 --> 00:11:28.513
I have never read science in my life and know nothing about it. Still I tell you all that.

00:11:28.593 --> 00:11:32.153
Where does all the knowledge come from? From the thoughtlessness;

00:11:32.233 --> 00:11:36.513
I only speak and see all that is going on.

00:11:36.593 --> 00:11:41.073
It was all kept ready in that computer which is speaking

00:11:41.153 --> 00:11:50.313
If you are not in the thoughtless state you do not use your computer and put your brain on top of it.

00:11:50.393 --> 00:11:59.393
It is such on old computer and lot of accurate work has been done on it.

00:11:59.473 --> 00:12:05.833
You are bound to make mistakes if you use your own brain and do not consult the computer

00:12:05.913 --> 00:12:08.033
It has no meaning.

00:12:08.313 --> 00:12:14.753
Thus the solution for all this is the prefix “PRA”. We say PRASHIKSHAN (Enlightened Education) in which we use the suffix PRA.

00:12:14.833 --> 00:12:19.313
[Ndlr – Whenever prefix “PRA” is used (in Sanskrit, Hindi or Marathi) it means enlightened].

00:12:19.393 --> 00:12:26.833
All that happens in the thoughtless state is enlightened and thus is PRA.

00:12:26.913 --> 00:12:33.673
It is so PRACHANDA (Enormous) – here again it is PRA.

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:36.073
Some other words are PRAKASHIT (brought to light),

00:12:36.153 --> 00:12:39.033
PRADNYA (wise),

00:12:39.113 --> 00:12:43.113
where we use the prefix PRA meaning enlightened.

00:12:43.193 --> 00:12:47.033
enlightened. Light never talks.

00:12:47.113 --> 00:12:52.153
If you switch on the light in the room, the light won’t speak or give you any ideas.

00:12:52.233 --> 00:12:55.193
. It would just make everything visible

00:12:57.633 --> 00:13:00.953
Same is about the light of thoughtlessness.

00:13:01.033 --> 00:13:06.673
That ‘NIH’ is common in all such words like ‘Nirvichar’ (thoughtless),

00:13:06.753 --> 00:13:08.553
Nirvajya (Selfless),

00:13:08.633 --> 00:13:11.193
Nirahankar (egoless),

00:13:11.273 --> 00:13:13.873
Nirakar (formless).

00:13:13.993 --> 00:13:17.793
Thus lots of words come from the prefix NIH.

00:13:17.873 --> 00:13:21.313
You establish it and then you come into Nirvikalpa (doubtless state).

00:13:21.393 --> 00:13:24.993
First become thoughtless and then doubtless (Nirvikalpa).

00:13:25.073 --> 00:13:29.393
Then all your doubts go and you know that there is some power that works

00:13:29.473 --> 00:13:33.873
It works very fast and is all subtle.

00:13:33.953 --> 00:13:41.553
is all subtle. You will be amazed how it happens

00:13:41.633 --> 00:13:44.993
This is also about time

00:13:45.073 --> 00:13:46.793
. I never see watch.

00:13:46.873 --> 00:13:55.073
Sometimes it stops and shows, when the time is 3.00 o’clock in the night

00:13:55.153 --> 00:13:59.153
Just to show others I wind my watch.

00:13:59.233 --> 00:14:02.113
But my real watch is in the thoughtlessness.

00:14:02.193 --> 00:14:04.753
It is permanently stopped.

00:14:04.833 --> 00:14:08.153
If anything is to be done, it takes place at the right time.

00:14:08.233 --> 00:14:13.593
Then there are no regrets whether it is late or not

00:14:13.673 --> 00:14:16.433
Whatever it may be I am where I am.

00:14:16.513 --> 00:14:23.673
Yesterday, my car failed but I was relaxing because I wanted to see the stars

00:14:23.753 --> 00:14:26.233
That beauty is not visible in London

00:14:26.313 --> 00:14:29.313
and I wanted to see it. Thus I was enjoying the starlit night.

00:14:29.393 --> 00:14:32.953
Others were worried and they started giving vibrations (bandhans)

00:14:33.033 --> 00:14:35.193
I told them, why are you wasting your vibrations?

00:14:35.273 --> 00:14:37.953
See the stars which you do not watch often.

00:14:38.073 --> 00:14:40.513
I had to see the beauty in the sky.

00:14:40.593 --> 00:14:42.833
Its splendour was spread all over the sky

00:14:42.913 --> 00:14:50.833
The sky thought Mataji should see it also because (it thinks) She always Her attention only on Sahaja yogis

00:14:50.913 --> 00:14:56.673
I wanted to get down and watch it but I was worried that the Sahaja yogis might think that I am in trouble.

00:14:56.753 --> 00:15:00.193
So I was just watching the sky from where I was and enjoying it

00:15:00.273 --> 00:15:03.793
In short, you should not be a slave of anything.

00:15:03.873 --> 00:15:10.953
If you are thoughtless God takes you everywhere as if on his hands.

00:15:11.033 --> 00:15:13.113
He makes all arrangements.

00:15:13.193 --> 00:15:17.033
He knows everything and there is no need to tell him about anything.

00:15:17.113 --> 00:15:21.113
But you must see whether you are in the PRAVAHA (main stream) or not.

00:15:21.193 --> 00:15:24.713
You should see if you are in God’s Pravaha

00:15:24.793 --> 00:15:31.433
If you are not in it then you are stuck up somewhere on the bank;

00:15:31.513 --> 00:15:36.353
then current comes and takes you in, twice or thrice but again you are on the bank.

00:15:36.433 --> 00:15:42.113
Then you say ‘Mataji, nothing goes smoothly for me’. It won’t. Because you are entangled.

00:15:45.033 --> 00:15:49.713
Shri Ganesha’s praise that you sing is excellent.

00:15:49.793 --> 00:15:55.673
It says, PADTA PRAVAHI “flowing in the main stream (Pravaha)” which means enlightened main stream

00:15:55.753 --> 00:16:01.833
We should swim in the pravaha. You should not bring your own separate, current in it.

00:16:01.913 --> 00:16:11.073
Pravaha also means enlightened vehicle. again ,"PRA"..who is enlightened

00:16:11.153 --> 00:16:21.353
The Arti of Shri Ganesha also says ‘Nirvani Rakshave’, i.e. protect me when I am dying.

00:16:21.433 --> 00:16:25.153
You also pray ‘Raksha Raksha Parameshwara’ O God protect me,

00:16:25.233 --> 00:16:27.513
, but you want to protect yourself.

00:16:27.593 --> 00:16:33.393
Why should, then, God protect you? He says, “let him protect himself.”

00:16:33.473 --> 00:16:38.513
Then you have all the sufferings of the world upon you like big mountains.

00:16:38.593 --> 00:16:40.153
I feel like laughing.

00:16:40.233 --> 00:16:48.553
These are all like balloons. They have no meaning

00:16:48.633 --> 00:16:53.073
What I want to emphasise is that you must learn to go deep within yourself

00:16:53.153 --> 00:16:58.313
and realise all this in the thoughtlessness then you can become Nirvikalpa (doubtless).

00:16:58.393 --> 00:17:01.513
You should attain Nirasaktata – Asaktata means attachments..

00:17:01.593 --> 00:17:05.873
You must have no attachment (Nirasakta). We have here, (India) ‘my son, my daughter’.

00:17:05.953 --> 00:17:07.553
In England, it is just the opposite.

00:17:07.633 --> 00:17:10.833
There, they are not attached to son or daughter

00:17:10.913 --> 00:17:12.913
They are worried only about themselves.

00:17:12.993 --> 00:17:19.153
Son is left to the dogs. They even kill their children.

00:17:19.233 --> 00:17:22.753
Some might not believe it but they kill.

00:17:22.833 --> 00:17:28.073
Each week a mother kills two children. They are so cruel.

00:17:28.273 --> 00:17:47.073
Here you have this attachment; my son, my daughter, my husband, my house etc., everything is mine and at the end your “self” is left out!

00:17:47.153 --> 00:17:52.033
You should say “Nothing is mine and everything is yours.”

00:17:52.113 --> 00:18:04.273
Kabir says “so long as a goat is alive it is bleating ‘main, main’ (I, I)

00:18:04.353 --> 00:18:15.833
but when it is slaughtered there is no life left, she realizes that I spent my whole life in saying “main, main”.

00:18:15.913 --> 00:18:18.953
Those whom I called mine have turned out to be useless

00:18:19.033 --> 00:18:26.433
everybody in the family, in the house – all those whom I considered to be mine have turned out to be useless.

00:18:26.513 --> 00:18:29.273
They themselves killed me and ate

00:18:29.353 --> 00:18:32.553
Then it realizes it’s mistake

00:18:32.633 --> 00:18:40.913
Then someone creates taut strings of its guts and fixes them on an musical instrument.

00:18:40.993 --> 00:18:45.393
When these strings are pulled they make a sound “Toohie, Toohie” (you alone are.)

00:18:45.473 --> 00:18:52.833
You must become like that.

00:18:52.913 --> 00:19:02.073
Once you are established in the idea I am nought, I have no existence, then only you will understand the word ‘NIH’.

00:19:05.793 --> 00:19:10.433
Let us consider the word ‘LA’. It is Lalita’s word.

00:19:10.513 --> 00:19:13.153
My second name is Lalita.

00:19:13.233 --> 00:19:15.113
It is the blessing of Devi.

00:19:15.193 --> 00:19:17.753
It is Her weapon

00:19:17.833 --> 00:19:26.633
When LA i.e. goddess becomes Lalit or when the Shakti becomes Lalit

00:19:26.753 --> 00:19:31.233
which means active that is when the vibrations rise within Her

00:19:31.313 --> 00:19:34.313
The waves of vibrations which you are feeling on your palms

00:19:34.393 --> 00:19:46.993
that shakti when is activated is Lalita Shakti.

00:19:47.073 --> 00:19:49.673
It is full of beauty and love

00:19:49.753 --> 00:19:52.913
Most important is that it is love.

00:19:52.993 --> 00:19:57.113
When the power of love becomes active, it becomes LA Shakti.

00:19:57.193 --> 00:20:00.713
She envelops you from all sides.

00:20:00.793 --> 00:20:05.793
When she is active, what is the worry?

00:20:05.873 --> 00:20:08.153
What is your power?

00:20:08.233 --> 00:20:13.113
Can you make even one fruit from tree?

00:20:13.193 --> 00:20:16.153
Show me if you can convert one fruit on a tree

00:20:16.233 --> 00:20:20.473
Leave, fruit, you cannot make even a leaf or a root!

00:20:20.553 --> 00:20:24.633
Only ‘LA’ shakti does all the work. The realisation that you have got is also from this power.

00:20:24.713 --> 00:20:28.233
From this Shakti have emerged ‘MA’ Shakti and ‘NIH’ Shakti.

00:20:28.313 --> 00:20:33.153
‘NIH’ Shakti is Shri Brahmadeva’s Power Shri Saraswati Shakti.

00:20:33.233 --> 00:20:38.513
And in Saraswati Shakti you must attain the qualities of ‘NIH’.

00:20:38.593 --> 00:20:43.753
Attaining ‘NIH’ is you must attain a state of ANASAKTATA ( complete detachment).

00:20:43.913 --> 00:20:46.473
. You must become completely detached.

00:20:46.553 --> 00:20:49.433
‘LA’ shakti has love in it

00:20:49.513 --> 00:20:53.993
She relates us to others.

00:20:54.073 --> 00:20:59.393
Word LA comes in words like LALAM, LAVANYA.

00:20:59.473 --> 00:21:02.353
All these words have got prefix LA.

00:21:02.433 --> 00:21:07.313
When we want a child to stop crying we say LA, LA, LA…..

00:21:07.393 --> 00:21:10.713
Word LA has a sweetness of its own

00:21:10.793 --> 00:21:14.393
and you should impress others with it.

00:21:14.473 --> 00:21:18.913
Should use this Shakti while speaking to others.

00:21:18.993 --> 00:21:27.273
What should you do when this Shakti the power of love, is spread everywhere in the nature.

00:21:27.353 --> 00:21:32.033
You should leave all thoughts to the first power because thoughts come from the first power.

00:21:32.113 --> 00:21:35.833
What should you do in the last power, i.e. LA Shakti?

00:21:35.913 --> 00:21:43.993
You should enjoy the bliss of love.

00:21:44.073 --> 00:21:47.073
How? By becoming TANMAYA (forgetting yourself).

00:21:47.153 --> 00:21:50.353
Has anyone measured how much one loves others?

00:21:50.433 --> 00:21:56.753
We should measure it. How you enjoy it?

00:21:56.833 --> 00:22:00.233
Does it occur to you, how much you love others?

00:22:00.313 --> 00:22:07.873
I always enjoy loving others; feel, how the love is flowing everywhere

00:22:07.953 --> 00:22:10.313
I do not know whether you feel or not.

00:22:10.393 --> 00:22:12.833
I cannot understand much about human beings.

00:22:12.913 --> 00:22:19.993
But I feel how the love is flowing all over. It is so joy giving.

00:22:20.073 --> 00:22:27.953
Like a musician who forgets himself in his own melodies and feels how his music is flowing everywhere.

00:22:28.033 --> 00:22:33.513
Similarly love must flow without any interruption. That is, the same as Lalam Shakti,

00:22:33.593 --> 00:22:37.633
which is the power of waves of vibrations, i.e. Lalita Shakti.

00:22:37.713 --> 00:22:40.833
Therefore, you should first achieve Lalita Shakti.

00:22:40.913 --> 00:22:46.713
You must first find out how is your attitude towards others.

00:22:46.793 --> 00:22:54.833
Some people of low category look at others with an idea to steal something or to get some benefit.

00:22:54.913 --> 00:23:00.953
Like when a thief comes he’ll try to see if there are new shoes lying around. He will steal them.

00:23:01.033 --> 00:23:05.673
Then they come in and try to find out if there are rich people around.

00:23:05.753 --> 00:23:09.833
Where are their pockets and see if they can find their purse.

00:23:09.913 --> 00:23:18.313
Then if they see a person in power then they shower praises on them,

00:23:18.393 --> 00:23:24.873
try to be friendly with them and try to obtain some gains from them.

00:23:24.953 --> 00:23:37.593
This is the view point of very low category of people who try to obtain benefit from everyone.

00:23:37.673 --> 00:23:42.873
There are some, who are interested in finding other people’s faults.

00:23:42.953 --> 00:23:55.393
I do not know what pleasure they get, but they keep looking for other’s shortcomings.

00:23:55.473 --> 00:23:58.473
What are they going to gain from such an attitude?

00:23:58.553 --> 00:24:06.313
This way they become aloof and then suffer.

00:24:06.393 --> 00:24:09.393
Only man can teach how to invite troubles.

00:24:09.473 --> 00:24:12.433
It is not possible for Me.

00:24:12.513 --> 00:24:16.113
How glad am I to meet all.

00:24:16.193 --> 00:24:27.393
(shree mataji speaking in marathi )

00:24:30.833 --> 00:24:35.713
You should use Lalam Shakti in such a way

00:24:35.793 --> 00:24:42.633
that you should go into thoughtlessness while looking at other person.

00:24:42.713 --> 00:24:48.473
That person also will then become thoughtless.

00:24:48.553 --> 00:24:54.593
Hence I ask you to do ‘Bandhan’. It is helpful to do ‘Bandhan’ to ‘NIH’ Shakti and ‘LA’ Shakti

00:24:54.673 --> 00:24:58.073
which is transferring ‘LA’ Shakti into ‘NIH’ Shakti.

00:24:58.153 --> 00:25:02.513
I have to tell many people to raise their left side and put to the right.

00:25:02.593 --> 00:25:12.393
I tell those people to raise their left sides, who are very proud or think they are working very hard or are very busy.

00:25:12.473 --> 00:25:18.353
It is filling our own love into own five elements.

00:25:18.433 --> 00:25:25.193
Love in our hearts or the power of that love from our hearts should be filled

00:25:25.273 --> 00:25:33.633
into the power of action as if you are painting with colours on a canvas.

00:25:35.353 --> 00:25:40.673
When the power of love is filled in the power of action in a person, he becomes extremely loving

00:25:40.753 --> 00:25:43.913
and that love gradually shines

00:25:43.993 --> 00:25:49.353
through his behaviours and in his personality and flows to others.

00:25:49.433 --> 00:25:52.553
In Marathi it is called SNEHALTE.

00:25:52.633 --> 00:25:56.433
It makes his every action enjoyable to others.

00:25:56.513 --> 00:26:00.113
Such person becomes so alluring

00:26:00.193 --> 00:26:11.433
that you feel relaxed and happy in his company for hours.

00:26:11.513 --> 00:26:15.273
So, your love should become enjoyable and winning other people’s hearts.

00:26:15.353 --> 00:26:23.713
This becomes useful in such a way that we get friends

00:26:23.793 --> 00:26:26.793
and the affection for each other grows.

00:26:26.873 --> 00:26:33.513
Everyone feels that there is a place where one can get all love and affection.

00:26:33.593 --> 00:26:39.753
Hence we must cultivate the God’s power of Love.

00:26:39.833 --> 00:26:43.113
If we get any thought we must tell ourselves that

00:26:43.193 --> 00:26:46.033
we are throwing dirt in the Ganges of God’s power.

00:26:46.113 --> 00:26:50.313
With this attitude of mind

00:26:50.393 --> 00:26:55.993
our ‘LA’ Shakti the power of love will remain absolutely clean

00:26:56.073 --> 00:27:00.193
and we will enjoy that cleanliness.

00:27:00.273 --> 00:27:05.033
You should never be critical of others.

00:27:05.113 --> 00:27:06.873
If you ask me about some person,

00:27:06.953 --> 00:27:12.273
I can only tell you regarding his kundalini and on which chakra he is caught at present or gets frequently caught.

00:27:12.353 --> 00:27:17.513
I cannot understand anything beyond that; but if someone asks me how he is or how his nature is etc

00:27:17.593 --> 00:27:20.233
I cannot understand the question.

00:27:20.313 --> 00:27:23.593
If one comes to me criticizing someone,

00:27:23.673 --> 00:27:27.673
I say ‘what is nature ?’ It is so changing!

00:27:27.753 --> 00:27:32.513
River is flowing here. Who can tell where it will be in future?

00:27:32.593 --> 00:27:35.113
You have to see where you stand.

00:27:35.193 --> 00:27:37.513
If you are on this side in the dirt,

00:27:37.593 --> 00:27:40.793
you are bound to feel it unusual that the river is flowing here.

00:27:40.873 --> 00:27:45.113
I see from the side of the ocean so I know where this river will join the sea.

00:27:45.193 --> 00:27:48.433
Transformation is a continuous process in Sahaja yoga.

00:27:48.513 --> 00:27:51.433
So never brand anybody as useless.

00:27:51.513 --> 00:28:00.273
Every person changes and he must change.

00:28:00.353 --> 00:28:03.873
The work of Sahaja Yoga is to bring about the change.

00:28:03.953 --> 00:28:12.913
Those who believe in Sahaja Yoga should never say that such and such person has become useless

00:28:12.993 --> 00:28:20.113
Everybody must be given the chance.

00:28:20.193 --> 00:28:23.313
You should try to see where you were, where you reached

00:28:23.393 --> 00:28:25.913
and where the river will go further.

00:28:25.993 --> 00:28:31.633
If you think this way you will not only respect yourself but will also respect others.

00:28:31.713 --> 00:28:35.553
One who has no respect for himself never respects others.

00:28:36.513 --> 00:28:43.833
We must develop ‘Lalam’ Shakti.I cannot adequately describe the joy of it even by writing a book,

00:28:43.913 --> 00:28:55.753
because it cannot be expressed through words they are very much inadequate.

00:28:55.833 --> 00:29:03.593
In other words if you have to describe smile

00:29:04.073 --> 00:29:09.993
you can only tell how the muscles move

00:29:10.073 --> 00:29:17.473
but you cannot tell the effects of the smiles.

00:29:17.553 --> 00:29:22.873
You should allow this power to be effective and develop it with this LALAM Shakti.

00:29:22.953 --> 00:29:28.393
Man gets a kind of beauty, an elegance and good nature from ‘Lalam’ Shakti.

00:29:28.473 --> 00:29:34.593
You must see that this power grows through your speech, behaviour and other activities.

00:29:34.673 --> 00:29:40.193
Some person’s annoyance is also pleasant.

00:29:40.273 --> 00:29:45.353
He gets annoyed in one minute and laughs in second minute.

00:29:45.433 --> 00:29:54.673
That sweet and pleasant power is called Lalita Shakti.

00:29:54.753 --> 00:29:58.113
People have completely distorted its idea.

00:29:58.193 --> 00:30:03.073
They say that it is the power of destruction. But it is not at all correct.

00:30:03.153 --> 00:30:15.753
This power is extremely beautiful, creative and artistic.

00:30:15.833 --> 00:30:20.393
Suppose you sow a seed,

00:30:20.473 --> 00:30:26.313
then some of its parts get destroyed this is also ‘Lalita’ Shakti.

00:30:26.393 --> 00:30:29.153
But the destruction is very gentle and easy.

00:30:29.233 --> 00:30:33.353
The seed then grows into a tree that has leaves.

00:30:33.433 --> 00:30:38.073
Those leaves also fall, which is again very spontaneous.

00:30:38.153 --> 00:30:50.273
Then come the flowers.

00:30:50.353 --> 00:30:57.713
When the flowers become fruits some of its components fall and then come the fruits.

00:30:57.793 --> 00:31:03.753
Those fruits are also cut for eating

00:31:03.833 --> 00:31:07.873
The taste that you get after eating is also this power.

00:31:07.953 --> 00:31:11.073
In this way these two powers work.

00:31:11.153 --> 00:31:15.033
You should understand that you cannot make any statue without cutting and chopping.

00:31:15.113 --> 00:31:21.233
If you understand that this chip-chopping is of the same kind,

00:31:21.313 --> 00:31:29.473
you should not feel bad, if you have to do it sometimes.

00:31:29.553 --> 00:31:31.233
That is also necessary.

00:31:31.313 --> 00:31:39.273
But an artist does it artistically whereas an artless person does it bluntly.

00:31:39.353 --> 00:31:43.473
So this power depends on how much art is in you.

00:31:43.553 --> 00:31:47.113
Some times you look at a picture and you want to keep looking.

00:31:47.193 --> 00:31:52.073
If someone asks you what is so nice in that picture, you cannot express it in words.

00:31:52.153 --> 00:31:58.633
You only look at the picture

00:31:59.713 --> 00:32:11.833
Some pictures are such that you become thoughtless just by looking at them.

00:32:11.913 --> 00:32:17.953
In that thoughtless state you are enjoying the whole pleasure of it, and this state is the very best.

00:32:18.033 --> 00:32:25.073
Instead of comparing it with something or describing it with similes you should enjoy the bliss of this state, to your hearts’ content.

00:32:28.873 --> 00:32:34.833
It is called RASASWAD.

00:32:34.913 --> 00:32:40.953
There are no words or no expression to describe it.

00:32:41.033 --> 00:32:47.353
You have to experience it from within. All should have this experience.

00:32:47.433 --> 00:32:50.753
The letter MA is very interesting.

00:32:50.833 --> 00:32:53.513
‘MA’ is the word of Mahalakshmi.

00:32:53.593 --> 00:33:03.673
‘MA’ is the power of Dharma (Righteousness) and also the power of our evolution.

00:33:03.753 --> 00:33:22.833
In ‘MA’ Shakti you have to put in effort, assimilate and achieve Mastery.

00:33:22.913 --> 00:33:30.753
For example, an artist conceives the idea of his creation with his ‘LA’ Shakti,

00:33:30.833 --> 00:33:35.153
he puts it practice with ‘NIH’ Shakti

00:33:35.233 --> 00:33:43.393
and then uses ‘MA’ Shakti to bring it in conformity with his idea.

00:33:43.473 --> 00:33:50.313
At every stage he checks whether it agrees with his idea and tries to improve, if it does not He does that again and again.

00:33:50.393 --> 00:33:57.393
This is ‘MA’ Shakti.That is, if something is not good do it again, once, twice and so on.

00:33:57.473 --> 00:34:01.313
This job of improving involves efforts.

00:34:01.393 --> 00:34:03.553
We have to improve ourselves also.

00:34:03.633 --> 00:34:07.193
But for this, the evolution would have been impossible.

00:34:07.273 --> 00:34:09.633
God has to make enormous efforts.

00:34:09.713 --> 00:34:21.593
We have to accomplish ‘MA’ Shakti and preserve it.

00:34:22.433 --> 00:34:27.753
If it is not done, other two powers fall off,

00:34:27.833 --> 00:34:36.513
because this power is the centre of gravity.

00:34:36.593 --> 00:34:42.633
So you should be at the centre of gravity, and the centre of gravity is ‘MA’ Shakti of our evolution.

00:34:42.713 --> 00:34:49.233
Other two powers will become active in you only when you grow along the power of evolution.

00:34:49.313 --> 00:34:57.313
But you must fully understand and develop ‘MA’ Shakti.

00:34:57.393 --> 00:35:01.313
You should not only depend on God.

00:35:01.393 --> 00:35:06.393
So long as you are not realized, it is alright to say that if God loves you He should come to you,

00:35:06.473 --> 00:35:08.913
but thereafter you cannot say so.

00:35:08.993 --> 00:35:14.873
For with ‘MA’ Shakti you have to balance other two powers.

00:35:14.953 --> 00:35:20.793
In melody you balance the tunes; while painting a picture you bring about the balance of different colours.

00:35:20.873 --> 00:35:27.153
Similarly you have to achieve the balance of ‘NIH’ Shakti and ‘LA’ Shakti.

00:35:27.233 --> 00:35:32.273
You have to work for attaining this balance.

00:35:32.353 --> 00:35:37.433
On many occasions you lose it. A Sahaja Yogi who can maintain it, rises to a very high level.

00:35:37.513 --> 00:35:40.913
Very emotional Sahaja Yogi is not good.

00:35:40.993 --> 00:35:44.153
Similarly very busy Sahaja Yogi is also not very good.

00:35:44.233 --> 00:35:51.233
One should activate one’s power of love and continuously monitor it’s progress.

00:35:51.313 --> 00:35:57.393
Suppose I follow certain method but even in that every time I do something different.

00:35:57.473 --> 00:36:02.393
You must have seen that every time, I come out with something new, some new method.

00:36:02.473 --> 00:36:04.633
If this does not work, try some other thing.

00:36:04.713 --> 00:36:07.393
If that also does not work, do something else.

00:36:07.473 --> 00:36:11.633
If something cannot enter (the body) through the head, try to enter it through the tail.

00:36:11.713 --> 00:36:19.233
Sometimes I tell it with a smile or with a cry or try to explain it lovingly, “It should be like this”.

00:36:19.313 --> 00:36:23.513
Nobody should fix his method.

00:36:23.593 --> 00:36:28.553
You rise in the morning apply vermilion, pay obeisance to Mataji; this is all mechanical.

00:36:28.633 --> 00:36:31.073
It is not a living process.

00:36:31.153 --> 00:36:36.553
In a living process, you should find out different new methods.

00:36:36.633 --> 00:36:39.313
I always give the example of the root of a tree.

00:36:39.393 --> 00:36:54.393
It penetrates deeper and deeper into the soil circumventing the obstacles. It does not fight with them.

00:36:54.473 --> 00:36:59.113
[The roots] would not have been able to hold the tree without the obstacles.

00:36:59.193 --> 00:37:10.153
Hence the problems are necessary because you cannot progress without the problems.

00:37:10.233 --> 00:37:16.913
The power that teaches you how to overcome these problems is ‘MA Shakti’.

00:37:16.993 --> 00:37:22.113
Therefore it is ‘MA Shakti’ i.e. Mother’s power.

00:37:22.193 --> 00:37:29.073
For that first thing required is wisdom.

00:37:29.153 --> 00:37:33.513
If someone says that I’ve been doing this in the past so I’ll continue doing it.

00:37:33.593 --> 00:37:40.913
For example a person is very mild natured and says, “Mother I am very soft what can I do?”

00:37:40.993 --> 00:37:43.353
I tell him to change himself and become a lion.

00:37:43.433 --> 00:37:49.553
If some other person is a lion I tell him to become a goat. Otherwise it won’t work.

00:37:49.633 --> 00:37:52.033
You have to change your methods.

00:37:52.113 --> 00:37:58.873
Person who cannot change his methods cannot spread Sahaja Yoga

00:37:58.953 --> 00:38:02.833
because he sticks to only one way, with which people get bored.

00:38:02.913 --> 00:38:08.113
You should find new ways. This is how ‘MA Shakti’ works.

00:38:08.193 --> 00:38:12.113
Ladies are expert in it.

00:38:12.193 --> 00:38:27.713
They make different recipes every day and the husbands are eager to know the menu.

00:38:29.913 --> 00:38:40.153
Thus they do not go to the restaurants but come straight home.Ladies are expert in it.

00:38:40.233 --> 00:38:57.353
This is the shakti with which you accomplish your balance and concentration.

00:38:57.433 --> 00:39:16.713
When you take it to the highest state, you get the vibrations flow from your balance and wisdom

00:39:16.793 --> 00:39:22.233
They will not flow if you do not have wisdom.

00:39:22.313 --> 00:39:30.833
Person from whom the maximum vibrations are flowing is a wise person; in fact it is his wisdom that is flowing.

00:39:30.913 --> 00:39:34.353
On this basis, it can be assessed how great Sahaja Yogi you are.

00:39:34.433 --> 00:39:40.153
Even if you pretend to be a great Sahaja yogi, it’ll be shown when you come on my Feet and see that catch on your chakras.

00:39:40.233 --> 00:39:43.793
You should know when you are caught that you have lost your balance.

00:39:43.873 --> 00:39:46.793
The imbalance shows that MA Shakti is weak in you.

00:39:46.873 --> 00:39:54.233
The first letter from any real name Mataji is MA that is mother

00:39:54.313 --> 00:40:00.193
and this work has been done only by ‘MA’ shakti within me.

00:40:00.273 --> 00:40:06.953
This was not possible if only ‘LA shakti’ or ‘NIH shakti’ were there.

00:40:07.033 --> 00:40:12.153
I have come with all the three powers but MA shakti is on top.

00:40:12.233 --> 00:40:21.433
You have seen that MA shakti is Mother’s power. It must be proved that She is our Mother

00:40:21.513 --> 00:40:26.073
Will you accept if someone comes and says “I am your Mother.” You won’t.

00:40:26.153 --> 00:40:31.153
Mother must be proved. What is Mother? We have a place in Her heart

00:40:31.233 --> 00:40:36.833
We have every right on Her and She has on us, because She loves us very much.

00:40:36.913 --> 00:40:39.233
Her love is absolutely NIRVAJYA (disinterested).

00:40:39.313 --> 00:40:47.633
She always wishes well of us and has nothing in Her heart except love for us.

00:40:47.713 --> 00:40:55.833
You will have faith in the Mother only if you understand that all that decorates you i.e. your spirit, is in Her.

00:40:55.913 --> 00:40:58.713
If your mother is dangerous who will believe in Her?

00:40:58.793 --> 00:41:01.553
You should prove all these to others.

00:41:01.633 --> 00:41:09.073
Sahaja Yogi should be able to do that. Other people should realise that he is a wise person.

00:41:09.153 --> 00:41:12.553
For that you need the balance;

00:41:12.633 --> 00:41:17.113
the balance between the powers of love and action

00:41:17.193 --> 00:41:28.553
and it should be so beautiful that people are influenced by such person without their knowledge

00:41:28.633 --> 00:41:31.593
Sahaja Yogi should accomplish it

00:41:31.673 --> 00:41:39.073
You think at home how to activate these three powers and use them.

00:41:39.153 --> 00:41:44.673
‘NIH’ Shakti should give all beauty and creativity to your homes.

00:41:44.753 --> 00:41:50.993
You should device new ways and means of contacting the people.

00:41:51.073 --> 00:41:54.713
These powers should be used to propagate Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:54.793 --> 00:42:03.833
For their proper use your ‘NIH’ Shakti i.e. the power of action should be very strong.

00:42:03.913 --> 00:42:09.673
Albeit, you must have main ‘LA’ Shakti that is the power of love.

00:42:09.753 --> 00:42:14.873
But LA Shakti is to be activated with ‘NIH’ Shakti.

00:42:14.953 --> 00:42:17.873
But if one way does not work, find some other way,

00:42:17.953 --> 00:42:24.673
try first red and yellow if it does not suit, take yellow and green and if that also does not help do something else

00:42:24.753 --> 00:42:28.553
. It would be wise not to be adamant.

00:42:28.633 --> 00:42:32.073
An adamant man cannot do anything in Sahaja Yoga.

00:42:32.153 --> 00:42:37.193
All that you want to do is to spread Sahaja Yoga for the wellbeing of human beings.

00:42:37.273 --> 00:42:39.273
Then try different ways.

00:42:39.353 --> 00:42:46.273
I always fall a prey to your insistence because if I do not do as per your wishes then you’ll be more obstinate.

00:42:46.353 --> 00:42:48.353
So I go along with your wishes.

00:42:48.433 --> 00:42:53.233
But sometimes I insist on having my way if I want to go somewhere or do something.

00:42:53.313 --> 00:42:57.353
Only occasionally I try to have my way but most of the times I do

00:42:57.433 --> 00:43:01.513
as per your wishes because I know that human beings are not like me.

00:43:01.593 --> 00:43:07.513
You can never tell what an obstinate person will do, you should not allow him to go to an extremity like removing his own eyes or nose.

00:43:07.633 --> 00:43:10.153
Thus one should not challenge obstinacy of a person.

00:43:10.233 --> 00:43:13.513
I know all this from ‘MA’ Shakti.

00:43:13.593 --> 00:43:18.673
But you should not insist on particular things.

00:43:18.753 --> 00:43:21.593
Mataji does not insist. Whatever is there, you should accept

00:43:21.673 --> 00:43:27.633
Whatever you do you should have in mind that you are doing an important work. I have no desire.

00:43:27.713 --> 00:43:32.393
There is no ‘LA’ Shakti or ‘NIH’ Shakti or ‘MA’ Shakti within me.

00:43:32.473 --> 00:43:34.553
There is nothing.

00:43:34.633 --> 00:43:38.033
I even do not know that I am these powers.

00:43:38.113 --> 00:43:43.593
I only witness all the play.

00:43:43.673 --> 00:43:58.193
When the life is changed like this there will be ‘Siddha’ Sahaja Yogis (i.e. those who have complete mastery over Sahaja Yoga) among human beings.

00:43:58.273 --> 00:44:04.553
So far they have not become siddhas.

00:44:04.633 --> 00:44:12.833
(asking in Marathi not to disturb )

00:44:17.673 --> 00:44:28.913
You have to achieve the mastery.

00:44:29.833 --> 00:44:37.713
. Siddha Sahaja Yogi is the one who becomes completely one with God and wins Him over.

00:44:37.793 --> 00:44:41.393
He has to do everything for that.

00:44:41.473 --> 00:44:44.833
I am now going away for a year

00:44:44.913 --> 00:44:48.793
After that, it is to be seen how and where you use your mastery.

00:44:48.873 --> 00:44:54.913
Sometimes I tell you not to do certain things You should not feel bad about that.

00:44:54.993 --> 00:45:00.073
You should not feel sorry in ‘MA’ Shakti because I must tell you not to do certain things.

00:45:00.153 --> 00:45:03.353
But some people feel bad about it.

00:45:03.433 --> 00:45:08.153
There was a yogi in Mumbai, who used to take others on his feet. I did not know anything about it.

00:45:08.233 --> 00:45:13.993
Once one of his disciples came to me. I was unaware that he had disciples of his own.

00:45:14.073 --> 00:45:19.073
So I asked him why do you take others on your feet? He felt very bad about it.

00:45:19.153 --> 00:45:22.353
. I said that the vibrations of both of you have gone down.

00:45:22.433 --> 00:45:26.073
So I said, you should take a promise that you’ll not take anyone on your feet.

00:45:26.153 --> 00:45:28.553
That’s why your mastery has decreased.

00:45:28.633 --> 00:45:31.633
It is absolutely forbidden to take anyone on your feet.

00:45:31.713 --> 00:45:34.353
That is the only solution.

00:45:36.033 --> 00:45:40.913
You must remember that you have to become master (Siddha).

00:45:40.993 --> 00:45:45.793
All others must accept that you are Siddha

00:45:45.873 --> 00:45:50.833
It should be clear to them the very moment they see you that you are Siddha.

00:45:50.913 --> 00:45:52.833
You must ensure this.

00:45:52.913 --> 00:45:55.833
If it happens everything will be fine.

00:45:55.913 --> 00:46:03.233
One day I told you that you should invite your friends and relations for lunch or dinner

00:46:03.313 --> 00:46:06.633
or for some function or tell them that you are arranging a big puja.

00:46:06.713 --> 00:46:22.313
Also call some Sahaja Yogis on that day and give realization to all your guests.

00:46:22.393 --> 00:46:25.273
If you do this for one year it will be very beneficial.

00:46:25.353 --> 00:46:32.313
This is a very beautiful talk, it can be translated into English and distributed.

00:46:32.393 --> 00:46:34.193
May God Bless You!
