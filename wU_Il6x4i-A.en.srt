1
00:00:06,424 --> 00:00:15,274
Now, we have sixteen centers in Australia
and Australia is a very progressive

2
00:00:15,274 --> 00:00:20,148
Sahaja yoga thing. We have got schools now
there, they're running schools and the

3
00:00:21,608 --> 00:00:27,748
teachers are extremely well-behaved and
visionaries and they look after the children

4
00:00:27,748 --> 00:00:34,380
very well. The government people sent
somebody for observation and they have

5
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,140
remarked that, "Whatever they proclaim,
that's what they manifest," and they have

6
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:44,504
given good certificates to us. And there's
another great thing has happened in Delhi

7
00:00:44,504 --> 00:00:52,156
University, that the Delhi University has
accepted that a person can do, only a doctor

8
00:00:52,156 --> 00:00:59,764
can do a PhD or we can say, the doctorate
in Sahaja yoga and he gets the highest

9
00:01:00,253 --> 00:01:06,473
degree called the Doctor of Medicine. And
a, perhaps maybe, after some time they

10
00:01:06,473 --> 00:01:12,263
will allow anyone to do that. This is about
the Medicine part of it. In agriculture we

11
00:01:12,263 --> 00:01:16,875
have done lots of research, for example, we
have somebody here, an expert on agriculture.

12
00:01:17,086 --> 00:01:24,776
He's also done lot of research and we found
out that with vibrations, we start after realization.

13
00:01:24,776 --> 00:01:30,826
If you vibrate the water and if you water
the plants with that, then sometimes you

14
00:01:30,826 --> 00:01:36,212
might get even ten times more breed. 
That's what they did in India, in one of

15
00:01:36,212 --> 00:01:40,785
the Agricultural University but here also he's
found out that there's tremendous difference

16
00:01:40,785 --> 00:01:45,765
between the growth of an ordinary thing.
Another thing we have found out in agriculture,

17
00:01:46,035 --> 00:01:53,295
that if you get vibrations then, even an
ordinary cow can give lot of milk but if

18
00:01:53,295 --> 00:01:58,028
you have hybrid cows then, you see, it's 
not good for the brain because the person,

19
00:01:58,028 --> 00:02:03,424
who takes hybrid milk, also gets hybrid
and his brain becomes little wobbly.

20
00:02:03,424 --> 00:02:11,654
So better, to have a pure milk from a cow which
is not being put to this kind of a experimentation.

21
00:02:11,654 --> 00:02:16,166
Moreover, food also, if it's hybrid food,
is also not very good for us because that

22
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:21,335
spoils our nerves, I think. But ordinary
seeds you cannot use because they have

23
00:02:21,335 --> 00:02:28,354
weakened and they cannot reproduce. So,
when we vibrate them, they produce very well,

24
00:02:28,354 --> 00:02:34,324
just like, better than even sometimes,
hybrid thing and the food tastes very well

25
00:02:34,324 --> 00:02:39,806
and it doesn't give those complications.
So this can help in agriculture in India and

26
00:02:39,831 --> 00:02:44,721
government has allotted us lot of land, 
where we going to now experiment and we

27
00:02:44,721 --> 00:02:49,313
are going to start the experimentation
there, to show that how we can use this.

28
00:02:49,415 --> 00:02:55,425
But many farmers, who are Sahaja yogis have
done a lot of job and they have discovered

29
00:02:55,425 --> 00:03:04,230
that even animals and this, what you call, farming,
everything is helped very much by vibration.
