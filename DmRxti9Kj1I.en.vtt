00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.600
One should know that you have to be responsible:

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.200
that’s a very, very important thing of life.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.360
I personally think, unless and until you feel that responsibility,

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.880
that heart into Sahaja Yoga, you will enjoy just my talk

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.440
as you would just enjoy anything else.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:29.600
Real enjoyment comes when your Spirit really blows out the vibrations.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.120
You are taking my vibrations, all right, you are feeling them, but what about yours?

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.000
Are you blowing your vibrations out or they are just eating your brain?

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.800
Simple questions is, are you blowing any vibrations outside?

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.440
We have some Sahaja Yogis when they just enter into a house

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:54.040
immediately everyone feels it. Everyone can feel it that somebody has come.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.120
Immediately the whole thing cools down in no time. Somebody has come.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:03.360
There are some here also, not that there are none, but they are few people.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.240
You have to blow out vibrations otherwise you are just a liability to yourself.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.400
Why don’t you blow out vibrations? Because you don’t feel responsible.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.120
In your day-to-day life, morning till evening, you have to see

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.000
that you develop this instrument of responsibility within you,

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.280
otherwise the vibrations won’t flow because, the main reason is

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:32.680
that our nervous system comes to us through our Right Side.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.680
Our nervous system is built up by our Right Side.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.400
All the elements within us have built [it] up. If the elements are weakened,

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.080
if the chakras which are made by these elements —

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.400
as you know all these chakras are made by elements —

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.200
if the pot is weak, nothing is going to work out.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:59.680
You should be able to hold that water of love

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.680
or you can say the water of bliss

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.320
and should be able to pour it out to others.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.480
Unless and until you are able to do that, Sahaja Yoga won’t spread.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.960
The point is: in all this talking of Spirit and God,

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.080
one has to know [that] the vehicle has to be better.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.840
The vehicle is so very poor that it cannot carry:

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.360
otherwise you will emit vibrations like this. I know you can.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.440
Wherever you will stand you’ll attract people.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.200
People must gather round you! You will be amazed,

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.840
I went to Australia for how many months?

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.200
At the most a month or so, and I came back from there:

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.520
already seven centres have started

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:46.120
and every centre has got at least three hundred regular people coming!

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.400
It is not to feel guilty: I am not saying [for that],

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.200
but to awaken yourself, to arise to this point,

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.360
to be elated with understanding that you have to rise up to that point

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.760
and that you have to take up that position

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.080
because you are the warriors of Truth.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.560
You are the people who are seekers, you have been for ages,

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.960
and you have no business to be irresponsible and you have to do it.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.400
It is my earnest desire that you understand what I am saying.
