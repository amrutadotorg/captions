00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.920
First I’ll speak in English language

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.200
and then in Hindi.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:37.360
Today, long time back,

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.240
Christ was born.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:47.520
You all know the story of His birth.

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:50.560
And

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:55.880
of all the sufferings He had to go through.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.760
He's the One who has

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:09.640
given us a model of a Sahaja Yoga,

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.720
for He didn't live for Himself,

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.680
in no way.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.040
But He lived for others,

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:25.200
working out the Agnya chakra.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.640
You may be divine,

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:35.480
you may be very powerful,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.320
but this world is so cruel

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:46.480
that they don't understand spirituality.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:52.480
They don't understand the spiritual greatness.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.200
Not only that,

00:08:55.520 --> 00:09:00.200
but there are many factors which attack spirituality.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.440
They have always done it.

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:07.800
Every saint has suffered a lot.

00:09:08.439 --> 00:09:12.440
But I think Christ has suffered the most.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:22.120
As you know, He was endowed with all the powers of Shri Ganesh,

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:26.480
as He is the reincarnation of Shri Ganesha.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:31.320
The first of them was His innocence.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:35.600
He was the eternal child we should say.

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:42.680
That He couldn't understand the cruelties and the hypocrisy

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.280
of this stupid world.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:52.320
Still, if you understand what can you do about it?

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:58.480
But with great courage He took birth

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:05.640
in the country where people had no idea of

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.920
spirituality.

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.800
I have read a book about Him

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:16.520
saying that He came to Kashmir

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:23.160
where He met one of My forefathers - Shalivahana.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:27.760
It’s very interesting because it’s all in Sanskrit

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:31.439
and the writer perhaps did not know Sanskrit,

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.800
so he has given

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.920
everything in Sanskrit language,

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:46.880
which is not very congenial, I'm sure,

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.560
to the Western people.

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.920
Thank God he didn't know Sanskrit,

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:58.360
otherwise it would have been very dangerous.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.200
It's written in that

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:06.760
that he asked Christ, “Why have You come to India?”

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:12.240
So He said, “This is My country,

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.640
that's why I've come here,

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:19.440
where people respect spirituality.

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.720
But I live among people

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:26.840
who do not understand spirituality at all.”

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:35.960
His conversation

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:39.840
with him was very, very interesting.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:42.240
Because Shalivahana said

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:47.400
that “There is more reason that You should go back to Your country

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:51.560
and teach them Nirmala Tattwam.”

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:57.320
That's the principle of purification.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:02.480
Went back, after three and a half years,

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:06.200
He was crucified.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:11.680
I personally think the big difference

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:17.200
between the Western execution and Indian

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:21.960
is that it’s -

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.600
in the West,

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:31.439
killing is a very great profession.

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:36.960
With the slightest pretext they kill people.

00:12:38.439 --> 00:12:42.760
Anybody who is a saint was killed

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:47.360
or they called him a madcap.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:53.160
It's the best way to avoid spirituality.

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:56.120
While in India,

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:00.160
if a saint says anything,

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:05.920
then he is not challenged - never.

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.960
But they believe in it.

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:14.920
Because he is a saint, he is a much higher personality than we are.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:19.800
Though there were very nasty people around and they tortured them.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:27.080
But as a whole the public, the people, respected them.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:36.360
If there are false gurus, normally they don't stay in this country

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.400
because they know they'll be found out.

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:44.360
Also they are so money-oriented that they go to America or

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:49.320
to some foreign countries and settle down there to make money.

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:56.800
This is one of the signs one should see.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.760
This may be one of the reasons why

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:05.200
Christ was born in a very, very ordinary family.

00:14:06.439 --> 00:14:12.120
He had no proper bed to sleep as a child also.

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:17.400
It's all described,

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.240
where He slept,

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:27.600
how His mother and father

00:14:29.439 --> 00:14:34.360
lived in a place where

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:39.520
there were cows and calves.

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:45.120
It was to show that

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:52.040
spirituality doesn't need any luxury,

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:57.880
doesn't need any pomp and show.

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:02.920
It is a power within.

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:09.120
It is a glow and the light within

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:13.000
which shows,

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:17.040
automatically.

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:21.439
You don't have to do anything to show it off.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:32.560
Such a person doesn't have any sense of money

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.040
and other things as possessions.

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:46.680
He was bothered about people who were suffering physically,

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:50.240
even the lepers,

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:55.320
and He tried to cure them,

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:03.800
He tried to help so many people who were sick physically,

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:09.600
because at that time,

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:14.439
there were no hospitals, no doctors.

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:18.240
So His attention was drawn to people

00:16:18.439 --> 00:16:21.760
who were suffering physically.

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:27.360
Also mentally He tried to prepare them.

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:33.360
There are so many beautiful sermons on the mount.

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:39.400
In a way that time, people

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.320
were not so materialistic,

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.880
so they listened to Him -

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:49.920
you can't say how many understood Him.

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:54.040
It's very important

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:58.160
that if you are not a realized soul,

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:02.320
then it’s difficult

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:07.920
to understand spirituality.

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:14.000
The one who is talking about spirituality

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:16.920
and the one who is listening to it,

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:23.320
both of them have to have minimum of realization.

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:30.880
So from His beautiful life that I've seen,

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.680
we have to learn

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:37.720
that unless and until we are realized soul,

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:45.480
we will be torturing the spirit of Christ.

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:52.400
We have seen it’s happening, all those who talk of Christ.

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.520
He has said it very clearly,

00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:01.360
“You'll be calling Me, ‘Christ, Christ,’ I won't recognize you.”

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.720
Very clearly He has said it.

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:09.120
I don't know why they didn't remove it from the Bible.

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:14.280
It means those who will talk

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.960
and preach and dress up

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:24.960
to show off that they are spiritual in the name of Christ,

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:28.640
He will not recognize them.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.400
It’s as simple as that.

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:38.680
And this time now when it's the Last Judgment,

00:18:39.439 --> 00:18:43.600
He is going to judge the whole world on the basis

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:48.200
of spirituality, which means vibrations.

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:52.840
His judgment has already started.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:56.160
I've seen it.

00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:00.160
You can see in so many countries

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:04.840
things are just disappearing.

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:08.440
All their ego,

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:14.240
all their aggressiveness,

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:20.439
all their cruelties are being challenged.

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:28.280
And those who did wrong in the war also

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:31.520
are taken to task.

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.040
So in the history also,

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:39.640
those who have done wrong to any community,

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:43.120
to any people,

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:47.120
they all will be taken to task.

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:52.680
They had no business to be aggressive on people

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:56.040
and to torture them.

00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:00.840
This is what is Shri Ganesha's principle

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:06.920
acting through Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:12.880
Christ didn't say that,

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:16.280
but He did say,

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:19.800
“There will be Last Judgment.”

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:26.480
On one side He was very kind and compassionate,

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:32.160
on the other side He was really Shri Ganesha,

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:35.439
because

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:38.560
He took a hunter to hit the people

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:44.720
who were selling things in the temple.

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:52.120
You cannot have business in the name of religion.

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:56.480
What a big thing it is to understand.

00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:02.400
But the Christians didn't follow that, they did not.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.080
I don't know where have they gone.

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:10.560
As we have Mahatma Gandhi

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:15.400
who talked of spirituality and nothing else,

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:19.600
adhyatma all the time.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.040
But his successors who came

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:29.080
put him somewhere with his spirituality

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:35.040
and started a new world, new ideas

00:21:35.439 --> 00:21:38.280
and a new style of life.

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:41.400
Those who are supposed to be His followers

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:45.840
are now wanting to have many pubs,

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.040
and also all kinds of things, can you imagine?

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.560
This Congress was started by Mahatma Gandhi,

00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:01.640
and the Congress wallahs are doing all this.

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:05.000
Where are they going to lead?

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:08.560
The beauty of this country is,

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:12.680
the treasure of this country is spirituality.

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:19.320
Instead of taking to spirituality, where are they going?

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:24.760
They may not be Christians, but they respect Christ,

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:27.280
they respect Bible.

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:31.720
I must tell you, is a fact, people don't know.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:37.800
They are not Christians means in the sense they are not baptized,

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:43.480
but they respect because they understand

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:48.560
that there was so much of spirituality about Christ.

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:53.480
He was the personification of spirituality.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.600
That's the beauty of Indians:

00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:02.600
if somebody is a Hindu or a Muslim, makes no difference.

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:07.880
There were many Muslims who were saints and Sufis in India,

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:13.960
they are all respected by everyone whether they are Muslims or Hindus.

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:18.960
So for Christ,

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.920
nobody has any objection at all.

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:27.960
On the contrary, you saw yesterday how they were all happy about it

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:30.720
because they are realized souls.

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:33.960
But even if they are not,

00:23:34.439 --> 00:23:38.600
in this country Christ is very much respected.

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:44.360
They can't understand, how can they scrutinize the life of Christ?

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:46.280
How can they judge Him?

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:50.240
And how can they make vulgar films about Him?

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:53.000
This they can't bear it,

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:58.840
because the respect that they have for spirituality

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:05.120
exists very much more than it exists outside.

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:11.560
Because in the name of Christ people have done such a lot of wrong,

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:17.320
such a lot of killing has been done.

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:23.720
All kinds of wrong things have been accepted.

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:29.360
With all this, one doesn't understand

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:33.200
how they have judged Christ.

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:39.600
For example, what I know in England, I saw, I was shocked

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:42.280
that if somebody dies, they drink.

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:45.200
If somebody is born, they drink.

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:51.320
Drinking is the only way they have relationships.

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:54.320
“How can you drink?”

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:58.280
I asked them. They said, “Why? Christ created wine.”

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:00.600
I said, "When?" "In a wedding."

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:04.320
I said, "In a wedding? That was not wine,

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:10.960
that was just the juice of the

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:16.760
grapes that they grew there."

00:25:17.439 --> 00:25:22.480
We call it drakshas in our language.

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:25.600
How can that be wine?

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.760
It has to be first fermented,

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:35.439
it has to be rotten, how can that be?

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:41.200
So this is biggest dharma - to drink.

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:47.200
But in India we know,

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:51.640
though nobody has said anything against drinking,

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:56.280
but we know drinking is a sinful thing.

00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:58.720
You see it everyday,

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:01.680
everybody knows that if you drink

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:04.400
you become absolutely out of your mind.

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:08.560
There's nothing to be said

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:13.960
on a religious platform, but everybody knows

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:18.960
that what is drinking is.

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:25.360
Not that people abroad don't know, they also know.

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:29.160
But somehow it has become a fashion.

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.360
Even in our country it has now been introduced,

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:38.760
I don't know how after Independence, people have started drinking.

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:42.320
Every party they drink,

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:47.880
also in the name of Christ on Christmas day.

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:56.200
It's such a insult to His beautiful holy life.

00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:04.440
So, when They came on this earth, perhaps all Their

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:08.880
powers of holiness were destroyed.

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:15.880
The very good thing about Indians is that at least they respect,

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:19.720
they respect a holy place.

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:23.720
That is something good about them.

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:28.000
And they know what is holiness is.

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:33.840
Now of course they are becoming very modern and Americanized.

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:39.760
But still, they know what is wrong,

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:43.040
what should not be done.

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:46.680
With Sahaja Yoga now I am very happy to say

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:53.280
that the foreign Sahaja Yogis also have become very beautiful.

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:57.440
I'm surprised,

00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:02.400
because in their culture there is no spirituality.

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:06.439
But I don't know how they left all that nonsense

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:12.360
and have come out like lotuses, beautifully,

00:28:13.439 --> 00:28:18.360
with such beautiful fragrance of spirituality.

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:23.200
This is something - a miracle.

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:26.640
Everybody says, “Mother, we can't believe it,

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:32.400
how could have happened ? How did You manage this?”

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:39.320
I would say it's the blessing of Christ.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.680
They saw how people are

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:50.520
working out in the name of Christ in a very degraded manner,

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:56.960
and they developed a kind of a awareness

00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:00.040
that definitely something wrong with this,

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:02.360
this is not Christ.

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:08.600
This is not His holy life they are depicting.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.800
It’s something else.

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:14.920
And that is how I think in the West

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:17.240
there's a greater urge,

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:22.320
greater ascending force.

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:25.520
Yesterday somebody came and told Me,

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:28.520
“Mother, there is no collective meditation.”

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:32.200
I was very happy to hear that.

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:37.880
What is most important is meditation in Sahaja Yoga,

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:40.600
no doubt about it.

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:42.400
But

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:49.360
the foreigners do meditation much more than Indians do,very surprising.

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:55.439
And foreign men and women are very highly equipped

00:29:55.680 --> 00:30:00.280
I must say, as far as spirituality is concerned.

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:02.320
Especially Russians,

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:06.760
I was surprised that in America,

00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:11.720
they told Me, “Mother, these Americans are not Sahaja Yogis.”

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:16.840
I said, “Why?” “They don't have that respect for You,

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:20.040
they don't meditate.

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:24.560
Those who do not meditate are not Sahaja Yogis.”

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:27.280
I said. "I agree."

00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:33.320
And they make all of them, all the Americans to meditate.

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:38.800
I don't know why in these Eastern Bloc people,

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:46.280
Bulgarians and Russians and all these Romanians,

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:50.560
how they have taken to Sahaja Yoga so much.

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:55.880
Of course, they had the curse of communism on them.

00:30:56.120 --> 00:31:03.040
Maybe that they felt that they have missed something in life,

00:31:03.439 --> 00:31:06.680
and they went deep down into themselves,

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:10.439
and that is how they have achieved it.

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:13.280
But I have to tell Indians

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:16.120
that they have to meditate.

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:21.920
Indians have one or two very bad qualities,

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:25.200
and that is one of them is groupism.

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:29.400
For example, if they're Brahmins, they'll sit together;

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:32.400
if they are Kayasthas, they'll sit together;

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:35.880
if they are Bhaniyas, they'll sit together.

00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:41.920
If that is not so, then by another name they'll group together.

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:46.600
This is the worst curse of My country,

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:50.640
because once you start grouping together

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.400
you can never see the good of others

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:57.200
and you can never see the bad of yourself.

00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:03.120
This grouping together can bring lot of problems in this country.

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:10.000
At the time of Christ

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:16.040
they had very different type of people.

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:21.240
Either they were interested in spirituality,

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:23.640
or they were not.

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:29.160
Now we have people here who are interested in spirituality,

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:33.880
but still they - one leg is in the water.

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:42.080
Where the age old problems still exist.

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:50.439
And this is the ruin of our country.

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:54.640
We cannot combine together,

00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:58.320
we cannot be friends with each other.

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:01.840
Of course not in Sahaja Yoga, I must say,

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:05.520
it has been solved very well.

00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:10.400
But if you see even at the time of Christ,

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:15.600
He had problems with His disciples.

00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:21.640
Especially something happened with Peter.

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:25.480
And

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:31.080
He is the one who says a Satan will meet you.

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:35.520
Because I think people

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:39.960
fall into the group of satanic forces.

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:44.600
And He said that He removed the satanic

00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:47.840
devils

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:51.560
from many people and put them in the pigs.

00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:54.200
It's true.

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:57.280
There is a satanic force

00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:00.960
which is working very strongly.

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:05.880
The more we develop security of spirituality,

00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:09.160
the more they will develop.

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:14.480
The satanic force is in a different form in the West

00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:17.960
and a different form in the East.

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:21.400
But I would like to tell for them

00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:25.320
to be careful

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:32.439
how to find out the satanic forces in the West.

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:44.480
You may not be affected by that

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:47.120
because you are realized souls,

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:50.640
but you’ll have to fight it.

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:53.480
You will have to fight it,

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:57.000
for example racialism.

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:05.640
Racialism is still very powerful there, very, very powerful.

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:11.520
And you have to fight racialism

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:16.240
through marrying people who belong to other races.

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:18.720
But still I find difficult

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:23.360
to marry a black person to a white person -

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:27.080
is an impossible situation.

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:31.120
If I try that I don't know what happens.

00:35:31.439 --> 00:35:34.600
Once we had such a marriage, I must tell you.

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:42.520
And a white lady, French lady, was married to a black man.

00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:49.200
Instead of the French lady dominating, this black man dominated.

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:54.439
So I was quite surprised, you know, how could that be?

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:57.840
So, the reason was,

00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:02.320
I think he was taking the revenge maybe, the respite.

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:04.880
So first of all,

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:10.000
tremendous love and affection has to grow

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:13.240
between

00:36:14.439 --> 00:36:16.400
the people.

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:21.240
This color is so skin deep.

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:27.880
It has nothing to do with the love inside, nothing.

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:30.280
It's so skin deep.

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:32.680
Thank God in our country,

00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:36.240
you can have a wife

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:40.240
who will be very dark, husband will be very fair

00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:43.240
or the vice-versa.

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:47.520
But they never look at that from that angle.

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:52.360
I don't think that exists in this country.

00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:55.840
But we have another kind, you see,

00:36:56.080 --> 00:37:01.640
just is a typical human problem

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:08.920
is that he discriminates. Through ego,

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:11.960
which I must say,

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:18.320
Christ has tried to fight your ego.

00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:23.760
He was born in a very humble family

00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:26.640
and

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:31.160
He was not a white-skinned man, no.

00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:35.080
In your language He was brown,

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:39.320
but in Indian language He was black.

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:46.760
But, when it comes to spirituality,

00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:50.240
you just see

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:54.440
the enlightened one.

00:37:55.600 --> 00:38:00.360
You don't see what color they have of the skin.

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:05.360
It's very, very superficial.

00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:11.400
But this is one of the enemies of the Western life,

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:15.200
I think, which must be conquered

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:19.400
Materialism is another one.

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:25.320
But the worst of all which is against Christ

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:29.040
is immorality.

00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:34.840
Immorality is so much accepted in the West.

00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:40.160
All kinds of immoral behavior is accepted.

00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:45.439
Like, they say that

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:49.439
all these immoral people say, vote for somebody,

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:52.920
he becomes a president of America.

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:58.480
Then it’s all right, doesn't matter, all kinds of immorality is allowed.

00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:03.320
But that is absolutely against Christ,

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:09.800
absolutely.

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:14.800
People don't understand

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:19.480
that immorality will lead them

00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:23.680
to a kingdom which I don't know what to call because

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:26.680
it's even worse than animal kingdom.

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:33.920
And they are so immoral,

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:38.000
they listen to people like Freud,

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:41.000
as if they have no brains,

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:44.680
they have no spirit,

00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:49.440
to take note of such a man.

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:55.320
Only after Sahaja Yoga,

00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:01.880
model of Christ's life you can have.

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:06.400
Whatever is past is over and finished.

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:10.040
Today now you are realized souls

00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:14.920
and morality is your strength.

00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:19.240
Forget about the past,

00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:21.760
and I'm sure

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:25.240
you can get many more people

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:29.840
under the banner of Sahaja Yoga

00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:34.360
if you lead a very, very moral life.

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:38.680
At the same time,

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:43.120
another very bad

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:49.720
enemy we have is our anger.

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:54.080
So they are very proud, they will say,

00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:56.560
"I'll now get angry.

00:40:57.320 --> 00:40:59.320
You know, I'm very angry."

00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:02.040
They are not ashamed about it

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:06.400
and they go on saying that "I'm very angry,"

00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:11.440
as if it's not wrong to say, "I'm very angry."

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:14.240
Now they say, “I hate you.”

00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:19.320
I mean, imagine any Indian language, if they use this word

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:23.000
it would be meaning “I'm committing sin.”

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:29.200
So all this aggressiveness comes from anger.

00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:34.480
If somebody has to be angry,

00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:38.720
he should be angry with himself.

00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:44.120
Best is, to get rid of anger,

00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:48.920
you can pull your hair, you can bite yourself,

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:55.240
you can use your pillow to hit yourself.

00:41:57.080 --> 00:42:03.080
That may be the best way of taking out your anger.

00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:06.560
But see for what are you angry?

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:10.120
Sometimes it’s absolutely useless.

00:42:10.439 --> 00:42:13.480
Sometimes it has no meaning.

00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:15.960
Sometimes

00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:21.280
it's absolutely maddening, stupid.

00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:29.640
But as long as you stop saying, "I'm very angry,"

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:33.080
that's it.

00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:39.600
That's the time you should know you are falling down completely.

00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:43.520
So Christ didn't talk of all the subtle things,

00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:47.360
I have been talking to you, because that was left to Me.

00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:52.040
Without realization, how can you talk about subtler things?

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:54.760
You cannot.

00:42:57.320 --> 00:43:01.600
Last time I told you about the vibrations,

00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:06.760
what is it, what does it stand for

00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:13.360
and how you get the subtle energy which we call as tanmatra,

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:18.800
of our light - tejas,

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:22.520
of water - jala,

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:26.000
and prithvi, agni.

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:33.480
But, I didn't tell you of one very special one

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:40.560
which is, in English language you call  it ether.

00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:43.160
But ether is the energy

00:43:43.439 --> 00:43:49.960
which is managed by another tanmatra, we call it akash.

00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:56.160
It's specially today, because it's Christ

00:43:56.440 --> 00:44:02.000
who has sacrificed His life to open our Agnya Chakra,

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:07.000
that we have reached that state of akash.

00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:11.320
Without Him it would not have been possible.

00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:17.600
We can have general communication.

00:44:18.439 --> 00:44:22.480
Like we can talk to people, we can say things,

00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:26.920
we can also use our fingers to express ourselves,

00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:30.920
our hands to communicate.

00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:34.280
But,

00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:39.640
to communicate vibrations,

00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:42.880
you have to have vibrations.

00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:47.280
Otherwise you cannot feel another person.

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:52.120
But if you are at the Agnya level, means you are mental,

00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:54.800
absolutely mental,

00:44:55.120 --> 00:45:00.640
then your vibrations also are dwindling, in the sense

00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:04.120
you don't know what really they are saying.

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:11.400
You can't judge your vibrations, because these vibrations are mental.

00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:18.040
They'll say, “Mother, we asked the vibrations.” I said, "Really?"

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:22.960
If you don't have any vibrations, how can you ask the vibrations?

00:45:23.439 --> 00:45:24.960
It's very common thing.

00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:30.800
“We ask the vibration; we found from the vibrations.”

00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:36.680
It's not possible because you are just mental.

00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:43.800
Now what Christ has done is to put you away from the mental level.

00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:48.480
That is the most difficult. While I’m surprised,

00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:53.480
those who follow Christianity have the worst mental position.

00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:56.840
They are mentally absolutely there,  like,

00:45:57.120 --> 00:46:01.600
I don't know what to call, like the fog of Delhi

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:07.000
that you can't cross.

00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:11.520
That’s what was broken was Christ.

00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:14.800
How much we should be obliged to Him,

00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:22.240
that He removed the greatest hurdle in the human ascent,

00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:25.439
and that one was

00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:29.000
to break this Agnya,

00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:34.680
this mental being within us.

00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:40.040
We read like mad,

00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:43.760
we listen to people like mad,

00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:50.160
we like those who give us feed for our mental being.

00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:55.560
They're so mental, so argumentative,

00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:58.400
think no end of their intelligence,

00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:02.720
that you have to just say, “All right, namaskar.”

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:07.880
You can't fight their mental attitude.

00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:12.200
That's why Christ

00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:15.520
is to be worshipped

00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:19.560
by people who are so very mental.

00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:28.120
And this mental nonsense has given

00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:31.600
such a sense of superiority to people.

00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:36.000
“Oh, whatever we do, what's wrong? What's wrong?”

00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:41.040
They cannot correct themselves

00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:46.960
because unless and until you cross this limit of mental being,

00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:52.200
you cannot see yourself.

00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:56.760
You cannot introspect . You cannot see yourself.

00:47:56.960 --> 00:48:00.160
You'll see others, “These Sahaja Yogis are like this,

00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:03.600
Sahaja Yoga is like that,” all kinds of things.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.320
But you can't see yourself,

00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:11.400
because the whole thing is mental.

00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:20.400
This mental attitude should be completely curbed

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:27.280
through the help of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:32.400
But He's also mental,

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:36.280
in your brains Christ is also mental, now what to do?

00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:41.280
The One who broke the mental attitude is also a mental -

00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:45.720
you have made Him into mental, like a statue

00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:49.160
of stone.

00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:55.400
So, firstly we have to tell ourselves,

00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:59.040
“Now don't think, don't think, don't think, don't think.”

00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:01.760
Four times,

00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:05.840
and then you can rise above.

00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:11.320
And this is very important.

00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:17.360
In meditation you have to go beyond the mind.

00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:23.000
And thanks to Christ that He’s sitting at the Agnya

00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:28.720
to finish off this nonsense of mental being.

00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:36.760
I think people should stop reading also perhaps, maybe.

00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:40.400
Even My lecture becomes mental, what to do?

00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:45.000
I mean everything goes into their head becomes mental, somehow.

00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:48.880
And then they ask Me questions, “Mother, did You say it this way,

00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:54.560
what did You -” I said, “I said it to make you thoughtless.

00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:58.080
Just to stun you,

00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:04.000
I didn’t say this to sit down and analyze and do, no, no.

00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:11.439
I said this that you become absolutely shocked and stunned.”

00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:19.760
So the best thing for all of you is

00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:23.920
to become thoughtless.

00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:27.400
That’s the blessing of Christ,

00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:31.240
that’s what He worked it out for you.

00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:35.320
And I am sure,

00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:40.080
if you work it out that don’t pay attention to others.

00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:45.240
Don’t react,

00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:47.520
just don’t react.

00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:51.040
Everything they will see, they’ll react.

00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:54.320
What is the need?

00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:57.600
What is the use?

00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:02.520
What are you going to do with that reaction?

00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:10.760
This reaction creates nothing but ripples of thoughts

00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:14.320
in your mind, I’ve told you hundreds of times.

00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:18.520
And now you have to become

00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:22.400
absolutely thoughtless

00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:25.720
after this puja.

00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:31.200
If that happens, I think we have achieved a lot.

00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:36.200
That’s the biggest blessing that Christ has given you,

00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:40.400
which you should really enjoy.

00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:47.400
Then only this Akash Tattwa in you will work.

00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:51.040
And how it works?

00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:54.960
Through your attention,

00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:58.439
it works with Me as you know.

00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:02.480
With My attention I work out many things.

00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:05.440
How?

00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:09.960
Just My attention has become thoughtless,

00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:13.280
just thoughtless.

00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:16.680
It goes wherever it goes, it works.

00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:21.840
But if you put your attention for thought all the time

00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:24.800
for thinking,

00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:30.240
then it doesn’t do the work that it has supposed to do.

00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:35.480
Attention works marvelously

00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:41.080
if you are thoughtless, otherwise it doesn’t.

00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:49.680
So it has to rise from your own self.

00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:54.240
Then from others

00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:58.240
to the higher level of humanity,

00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:02.320
where you are in communication with the sky,

00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:05.360
with, we can call it as the

00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:11.480
tanmatra, or the essential, or the essence

00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:14.680
of ether.

00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:19.960
With ether you can have television, you can have telephone.

00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:22.280
It's a miracle otherwise.

00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:25.520
But with this tanmatra,

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.040
sitting down here

00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:31.439
you can do the job.

00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:34.040
It works,

00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:37.520
just attention works. I know that.

00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:39.600
You also know very well.

00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:43.280
You don't have to ask Me to put the attention,

00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:47.000
you just put the attention and it will work out.

00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:52.320
It’s a very important thing that you have got.

00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:56.400
I think that is the first thing -

00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:59.040
once you have,

00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:01.840
no problem.

00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:09.080
But we start manifesting from the earth element.

00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:15.040
Then from the agni element, then from the jala element,

00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:19.840
and then we come to tejas,

00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:24.240
where the face starts shining.

00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:29.480
But lastly we get this thoughtless awareness

00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:35.160
by which our attention is absolutely free to do

00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:38.640
some special work.

00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:42.080
But if you are all the time thinking,

00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:45.520
then poor this attention

00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:49.760
is so busy, you know, so very busy.

00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:53.160
You don't have to ask Me then,

00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:56.439
"Mother, please pay attention." You can pay attention,

00:54:56.720 --> 00:54:59.280
and you can work it out.

00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:09.640
In this attention, you don't feel

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:13.040
what you've got, what you are standing,

00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:19.760
what you are wearing, what others are doing - no, nothing.

00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:24.040
You are one with yourself.

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:30.000
And it's a life full of humor.

00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:33.880
So much humor.

00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:36.440
So much of joy.

00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:39.560
So much of happiness

00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:42.840
that you don't care for anything

00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:46.160
that normally people care for.

00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:52.440
So,

00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:59.120
as it is now Sahaja Yoga has worked in so many countries.

00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:02.920
I'm so very proud of you, very proud.

00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:06.960
And now it is also going to African countries,

00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:11.440
is a very great satisfaction for Me.

00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:17.040
And you all can do it;

00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:19.960
you all can work it out.

00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:25.080
Only thing, become thoughtlessly aware,

00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:27.520
as the blessing of Christ.

00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:29.920
If it works,

00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:36.640
you will be absolutely enjoying yourself.

00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:40.640
So may God bless you.
