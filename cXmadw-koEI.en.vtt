07:20.520 --> 07:23.920
First I’ll speak in English language

07:24.200 --> 07:27.200
and then in Hindi.

07:32.360 --> 07:37.360
Today, long time back,

07:38.160 --> 07:42.240
Christ was born.

07:43.920 --> 07:47.520
You all know the story of His birth.

07:47.760 --> 07:50.560
And

07:51.080 --> 07:55.880
of all the sufferings He had to go through.

08:00.960 --> 08:04.760
He's the One who has

08:05.400 --> 08:09.640
given us a model of a Sahaja Yoga,

08:11.120 --> 08:13.720
for He didn't live for Himself,

08:14.280 --> 08:16.680
in no way.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.040
But He lived for others,

08:20.800 --> 08:25.200
working out the Agnya chakra.

08:26.440 --> 08:29.640
You may be divine,

08:32.120 --> 08:35.480
you may be very powerful,

08:37.000 --> 08:40.320
but this world is so cruel

08:41.400 --> 08:46.480
that they don't understand spirituality.

08:47.240 --> 08:52.480
They don't understand the spiritual greatness.

08:53.440 --> 08:55.200
Not only that,

08:55.520 --> 09:00.200
but there are many factors which attack spirituality.

09:00.400 --> 09:03.440
They have always done it.

09:03.880 --> 09:07.800
Every saint has suffered a lot.

09:08.439 --> 09:12.440
But I think Christ has suffered the most.

09:16.040 --> 09:22.120
As you know, He was endowed with all the powers of Shri Ganesh,

09:22.480 --> 09:26.480
as He is the reincarnation of Shri Ganesha.

09:27.680 --> 09:31.320
The first of them was His innocence.

09:32.040 --> 09:35.600
He was the eternal child we should say.

09:36.320 --> 09:42.680
That He couldn't understand the cruelties and the hypocrisy

09:43.200 --> 09:46.280
of this stupid world.

09:47.320 --> 09:52.320
Still, if you understand what can you do about it?

09:53.920 --> 09:58.480
But with great courage He took birth

09:59.480 --> 10:05.640
in the country where people had no idea of

10:06.120 --> 10:08.920
spirituality.

10:10.280 --> 10:12.800
I have read a book about Him

10:13.080 --> 10:16.520
saying that He came to Kashmir

10:16.800 --> 10:23.160
where He met one of My forefathers - Shalivahana.

10:23.680 --> 10:27.760
It’s very interesting because it’s all in Sanskrit

10:28.120 --> 10:31.439
and the writer perhaps did not know Sanskrit,

10:31.800 --> 10:34.800
so he has given

10:36.000 --> 10:40.920
everything in Sanskrit language,

10:42.080 --> 10:46.880
which is not very congenial, I'm sure,

10:47.520 --> 10:50.560
to the Western people.

10:51.280 --> 10:53.920
Thank God he didn't know Sanskrit,

10:54.280 --> 10:58.360
otherwise it would have been very dangerous.

11:00.080 --> 11:02.200
It's written in that

11:02.400 --> 11:06.760
that he asked Christ, “Why have You come to India?”

11:08.480 --> 11:12.240
So He said, “This is My country,

11:13.360 --> 11:15.640
that's why I've come here,

11:15.920 --> 11:19.440
where people respect spirituality.

11:20.320 --> 11:22.720
But I live among people

11:22.920 --> 11:26.840
who do not understand spirituality at all.”

11:31.280 --> 11:35.960
His conversation

11:36.680 --> 11:39.840
with him was very, very interesting.

11:40.080 --> 11:42.240
Because Shalivahana said

11:42.480 --> 11:47.400
that “There is more reason that You should go back to Your country

11:47.800 --> 11:51.560
and teach them Nirmala Tattwam.”

11:52.040 --> 11:57.320
That's the principle of purification.

11:58.320 --> 12:02.480
Went back, after three and a half years,

12:02.960 --> 12:06.200
He was crucified.

12:08.680 --> 12:11.680
I personally think the big difference

12:12.120 --> 12:17.200
between the Western execution and Indian

12:17.560 --> 12:21.960
is that it’s -

12:22.720 --> 12:24.600
in the West,

12:24.960 --> 12:31.439
killing is a very great profession.

12:32.760 --> 12:36.960
With the slightest pretext they kill people.

12:38.439 --> 12:42.760
Anybody who is a saint was killed

12:43.040 --> 12:47.360
or they called him a madcap.

12:47.760 --> 12:53.160
It's the best way to avoid spirituality.

12:54.040 --> 12:56.120
While in India,

12:57.120 --> 13:00.160
if a saint says anything,

13:01.600 --> 13:05.920
then he is not challenged - never.

13:06.240 --> 13:08.960
But they believe in it.

13:09.280 --> 13:14.920
Because he is a saint, he is a much higher personality than we are.

13:15.200 --> 13:19.800
Though there were very nasty people around and they tortured them.

13:20.200 --> 13:27.080
But as a whole the public, the people, respected them.

13:31.360 --> 13:36.360
If there are false gurus, normally they don't stay in this country

13:36.560 --> 13:39.400
because they know they'll be found out.

13:39.680 --> 13:44.360
Also they are so money-oriented that they go to America or

13:44.640 --> 13:49.320
to some foreign countries and settle down there to make money.

13:53.680 --> 13:56.800
This is one of the signs one should see.

13:57.200 --> 13:59.760
This may be one of the reasons why

14:00.040 --> 14:05.200
Christ was born in a very, very ordinary family.

14:06.439 --> 14:12.120
He had no proper bed to sleep as a child also.

14:14.400 --> 14:17.400
It's all described,

14:20.360 --> 14:23.240
where He slept,

14:23.560 --> 14:27.600
how His mother and father

14:29.439 --> 14:34.360
lived in a place where

14:34.800 --> 14:39.520
there were cows and calves.

14:40.840 --> 14:45.120
It was to show that

14:45.520 --> 14:52.040
spirituality doesn't need any luxury,

14:53.040 --> 14:57.880
doesn't need any pomp and show.

14:58.880 --> 15:02.920
It is a power within.

15:04.040 --> 15:09.120
It is a glow and the light within

15:09.960 --> 15:13.000
which shows,

15:14.840 --> 15:17.040
automatically.

15:17.360 --> 15:21.439
You don't have to do anything to show it off.

15:25.800 --> 15:32.560
Such a person doesn't have any sense of money

15:33.000 --> 15:37.040
and other things as possessions.

15:41.920 --> 15:46.680
He was bothered about people who were suffering physically,

15:47.400 --> 15:50.240
even the lepers,

15:50.680 --> 15:55.320
and He tried to cure them,

15:57.480 --> 16:03.800
He tried to help so many people who were sick physically,

16:06.840 --> 16:09.600
because at that time,

16:09.880 --> 16:14.439
there were no hospitals, no doctors.

16:15.440 --> 16:18.240
So His attention was drawn to people

16:18.439 --> 16:21.760
who were suffering physically.

16:23.120 --> 16:27.360
Also mentally He tried to prepare them.

16:28.080 --> 16:33.360
There are so many beautiful sermons on the mount.

16:34.760 --> 16:39.400
In a way that time, people

16:40.400 --> 16:43.320
were not so materialistic,

16:43.560 --> 16:45.880
so they listened to Him -

16:46.360 --> 16:49.920
you can't say how many understood Him.

16:51.640 --> 16:54.040
It's very important

16:54.240 --> 16:58.160
that if you are not a realized soul,

16:59.280 --> 17:02.320
then it’s difficult

17:03.360 --> 17:07.920
to understand spirituality.

17:09.720 --> 17:14.000
The one who is talking about spirituality

17:14.280 --> 17:16.920
and the one who is listening to it,

17:17.120 --> 17:23.320
both of them have to have minimum of realization.

17:25.520 --> 17:30.880
So from His beautiful life that I've seen,

17:31.640 --> 17:33.680
we have to learn

17:33.880 --> 17:37.720
that unless and until we are realized soul,

17:38.520 --> 17:45.480
we will be torturing the spirit of Christ.

17:47.080 --> 17:52.400
We have seen it’s happening, all those who talk of Christ.

17:52.800 --> 17:55.520
He has said it very clearly,

17:55.920 --> 18:01.360
“You'll be calling Me, ‘Christ, Christ,’ I won't recognize you.”

18:02.320 --> 18:04.720
Very clearly He has said it.

18:05.040 --> 18:09.120
I don't know why they didn't remove it from the Bible.

18:09.760 --> 18:14.280
It means those who will talk

18:15.000 --> 18:18.960
and preach and dress up

18:19.360 --> 18:24.960
to show off that they are spiritual in the name of Christ,

18:25.280 --> 18:28.640
He will not recognize them.

18:30.400 --> 18:33.400
It’s as simple as that.

18:34.400 --> 18:38.680
And this time now when it's the Last Judgment,

18:39.439 --> 18:43.600
He is going to judge the whole world on the basis

18:43.920 --> 18:48.200
of spirituality, which means vibrations.

18:49.040 --> 18:52.840
His judgment has already started.

18:53.720 --> 18:56.160
I've seen it.

18:56.560 --> 19:00.160
You can see in so many countries

19:00.520 --> 19:04.840
things are just disappearing.

19:05.680 --> 19:08.440
All their ego,

19:08.880 --> 19:14.240
all their aggressiveness,

19:15.640 --> 19:20.439
all their cruelties are being challenged.

19:22.520 --> 19:28.280
And those who did wrong in the war also

19:28.680 --> 19:31.520
are taken to task.

19:32.720 --> 19:35.040
So in the history also,

19:35.280 --> 19:39.640
those who have done wrong to any community,

19:40.080 --> 19:43.120
to any people,

19:43.720 --> 19:47.120
they all will be taken to task.

19:47.800 --> 19:52.680
They had no business to be aggressive on people

19:52.920 --> 19:56.040
and to torture them.

19:56.560 --> 20:00.840
This is what is Shri Ganesha's principle

20:01.480 --> 20:06.920
acting through Sahaja Yoga.

20:08.960 --> 20:12.880
Christ didn't say that,

20:13.400 --> 20:16.280
but He did say,

20:16.680 --> 20:19.800
“There will be Last Judgment.”

20:20.240 --> 20:26.480
On one side He was very kind and compassionate,

20:27.320 --> 20:32.160
on the other side He was really Shri Ganesha,

20:32.400 --> 20:35.439
because

20:36.120 --> 20:38.560
He took a hunter to hit the people

20:38.800 --> 20:44.720
who were selling things in the temple.

20:46.320 --> 20:52.120
You cannot have business in the name of religion.

20:52.760 --> 20:56.480
What a big thing it is to understand.

20:57.160 --> 21:02.400
But the Christians didn't follow that, they did not.

21:03.000 --> 21:06.080
I don't know where have they gone.

21:06.360 --> 21:10.560
As we have Mahatma Gandhi

21:10.880 --> 21:15.400
who talked of spirituality and nothing else,

21:16.680 --> 21:19.600
adhyatma all the time.

21:20.000 --> 21:25.040
But his successors who came

21:25.440 --> 21:29.080
put him somewhere with his spirituality

21:29.320 --> 21:35.040
and started a new world, new ideas

21:35.439 --> 21:38.280
and a new style of life.

21:39.080 --> 21:41.400
Those who are supposed to be His followers

21:41.680 --> 21:45.840
are now wanting to have many pubs,

21:48.000 --> 21:52.040
and also all kinds of things, can you imagine?

21:53.000 --> 21:57.560
This Congress was started by Mahatma Gandhi,

21:58.040 --> 22:01.640
and the Congress wallahs are doing all this.

22:01.920 --> 22:05.000
Where are they going to lead?

22:06.120 --> 22:08.560
The beauty of this country is,

22:08.760 --> 22:12.680
the treasure of this country is spirituality.

22:13.800 --> 22:19.320
Instead of taking to spirituality, where are they going?

22:20.320 --> 22:24.760
They may not be Christians, but they respect Christ,

22:25.080 --> 22:27.280
they respect Bible.

22:27.480 --> 22:31.720
I must tell you, is a fact, people don't know.

22:31.960 --> 22:37.800
They are not Christians means in the sense they are not baptized,

22:38.040 --> 22:43.480
but they respect because they understand

22:43.720 --> 22:48.560
that there was so much of spirituality about Christ.

22:48.840 --> 22:53.480
He was the personification of spirituality.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.600
That's the beauty of Indians:

22:57.920 --> 23:02.600
if somebody is a Hindu or a Muslim, makes no difference.

23:03.240 --> 23:07.880
There were many Muslims who were saints and Sufis in India,

23:08.120 --> 23:13.960
they are all respected by everyone whether they are Muslims or Hindus.

23:16.400 --> 23:18.960
So for Christ,

23:19.600 --> 23:22.920
nobody has any objection at all.

23:23.160 --> 23:27.960
On the contrary, you saw yesterday how they were all happy about it

23:28.320 --> 23:30.720
because they are realized souls.

23:30.960 --> 23:33.960
But even if they are not,

23:34.439 --> 23:38.600
in this country Christ is very much respected.

23:38.840 --> 23:44.360
They can't understand, how can they scrutinize the life of Christ?

23:44.760 --> 23:46.280
How can they judge Him?

23:46.480 --> 23:50.240
And how can they make vulgar films about Him?

23:50.640 --> 23:53.000
This they can't bear it,

23:53.240 --> 23:58.840
because the respect that they have for spirituality

23:59.400 --> 24:05.120
exists very much more than it exists outside.

24:05.480 --> 24:11.560
Because in the name of Christ people have done such a lot of wrong,

24:12.600 --> 24:17.320
such a lot of killing has been done.

24:17.920 --> 24:23.720
All kinds of wrong things have been accepted.

24:24.280 --> 24:29.360
With all this, one doesn't understand

24:29.920 --> 24:33.200
how they have judged Christ.

24:33.680 --> 24:39.600
For example, what I know in England, I saw, I was shocked

24:39.840 --> 24:42.280
that if somebody dies, they drink.

24:42.560 --> 24:45.200
If somebody is born, they drink.

24:45.480 --> 24:51.320
Drinking is the only way they have relationships.

24:51.880 --> 24:54.320
“How can you drink?”

24:54.520 --> 24:58.280
I asked them. They said, “Why? Christ created wine.”

24:58.480 --> 25:00.600
I said, "When?" "In a wedding."

25:00.800 --> 25:04.320
I said, "In a wedding? That was not wine,

25:04.640 --> 25:10.960
that was just the juice of the

25:13.680 --> 25:16.760
grapes that they grew there."

25:17.439 --> 25:22.480
We call it drakshas in our language.

25:23.040 --> 25:25.600
How can that be wine?

25:26.000 --> 25:30.760
It has to be first fermented,

25:31.080 --> 25:35.439
it has to be rotten, how can that be?

25:35.960 --> 25:41.200
So this is biggest dharma - to drink.

25:44.560 --> 25:47.200
But in India we know,

25:47.440 --> 25:51.640
though nobody has said anything against drinking,

25:52.080 --> 25:56.280
but we know drinking is a sinful thing.

25:56.760 --> 25:58.720
You see it everyday,

25:58.960 --> 26:01.680
everybody knows that if you drink

26:01.880 --> 26:04.400
you become absolutely out of your mind.

26:04.680 --> 26:08.560
There's nothing to be said

26:09.160 --> 26:13.960
on a religious platform, but everybody knows

26:14.880 --> 26:18.960
that what is drinking is.

26:21.520 --> 26:25.360
Not that people abroad don't know, they also know.

26:25.560 --> 26:29.160
But somehow it has become a fashion.

26:29.560 --> 26:32.360
Even in our country it has now been introduced,

26:32.560 --> 26:38.760
I don't know how after Independence, people have started drinking.

26:39.280 --> 26:42.320
Every party they drink,

26:42.960 --> 26:47.880
also in the name of Christ on Christmas day.

26:48.840 --> 26:56.200
It's such a insult to His beautiful holy life.

26:58.120 --> 27:04.440
So, when They came on this earth, perhaps all Their

27:05.120 --> 27:08.880
powers of holiness were destroyed.

27:09.600 --> 27:15.880
The very good thing about Indians is that at least they respect,

27:16.440 --> 27:19.720
they respect a holy place.

27:20.600 --> 27:23.720
That is something good about them.

27:24.080 --> 27:28.000
And they know what is holiness is.

27:29.120 --> 27:33.840
Now of course they are becoming very modern and Americanized.

27:34.080 --> 27:39.760
But still, they know what is wrong,

27:40.080 --> 27:43.040
what should not be done.

27:43.400 --> 27:46.680
With Sahaja Yoga now I am very happy to say

27:46.960 --> 27:53.280
that the foreign Sahaja Yogis also have become very beautiful.

27:55.360 --> 27:57.440
I'm surprised,

27:57.840 --> 28:02.400
because in their culture there is no spirituality.

28:02.840 --> 28:06.439
But I don't know how they left all that nonsense

28:06.840 --> 28:12.360
and have come out like lotuses, beautifully,

28:13.439 --> 28:18.360
with such beautiful fragrance of spirituality.

28:19.320 --> 28:23.200
This is something - a miracle.

28:23.440 --> 28:26.640
Everybody says, “Mother, we can't believe it,

28:26.840 --> 28:32.400
how could have happened ? How did You manage this?”

28:34.320 --> 28:39.320
I would say it's the blessing of Christ.

28:40.000 --> 28:44.680
They saw how people are

28:45.800 --> 28:50.520
working out in the name of Christ in a very degraded manner,

28:50.840 --> 28:56.960
and they developed a kind of a awareness

28:57.400 --> 29:00.040
that definitely something wrong with this,

29:00.400 --> 29:02.360
this is not Christ.

29:02.560 --> 29:08.600
This is not His holy life they are depicting.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.800
It’s something else.

29:11.120 --> 29:14.920
And that is how I think in the West

29:15.160 --> 29:17.240
there's a greater urge,

29:17.600 --> 29:22.320
greater ascending force.

29:23.280 --> 29:25.520
Yesterday somebody came and told Me,

29:25.760 --> 29:28.520
“Mother, there is no collective meditation.”

29:28.760 --> 29:32.200
I was very happy to hear that.

29:33.760 --> 29:37.880
What is most important is meditation in Sahaja Yoga,

29:38.400 --> 29:40.600
no doubt about it.

29:41.080 --> 29:42.400
But

29:42.600 --> 29:49.360
the foreigners do meditation much more than Indians do,very surprising.

29:49.800 --> 29:55.439
And foreign men and women are very highly equipped

29:55.680 --> 30:00.280
I must say, as far as spirituality is concerned.

30:00.680 --> 30:02.320
Especially Russians,

30:02.600 --> 30:06.760
I was surprised that in America,

30:07.280 --> 30:11.720
they told Me, “Mother, these Americans are not Sahaja Yogis.”

30:12.480 --> 30:16.840
I said, “Why?” “They don't have that respect for You,

30:17.360 --> 30:20.040
they don't meditate.

30:20.400 --> 30:24.560
Those who do not meditate are not Sahaja Yogis.”

30:25.040 --> 30:27.280
I said. "I agree."

30:27.560 --> 30:33.320
And they make all of them, all the Americans to meditate.

30:33.920 --> 30:38.800
I don't know why in these Eastern Bloc people,

30:39.240 --> 30:46.280
Bulgarians and Russians and all these Romanians,

30:46.760 --> 30:50.560
how they have taken to Sahaja Yoga so much.

30:51.080 --> 30:55.880
Of course, they had the curse of communism on them.

30:56.120 --> 31:03.040
Maybe that they felt that they have missed something in life,

31:03.439 --> 31:06.680
and they went deep down into themselves,

31:06.960 --> 31:10.439
and that is how they have achieved it.

31:10.840 --> 31:13.280
But I have to tell Indians

31:13.640 --> 31:16.120
that they have to meditate.

31:16.720 --> 31:21.920
Indians have one or two very bad qualities,

31:22.760 --> 31:25.200
and that is one of them is groupism.

31:25.640 --> 31:29.400
For example, if they're Brahmins, they'll sit together;

31:29.760 --> 31:32.400
if they are Kayasthas, they'll sit together;

31:32.760 --> 31:35.880
if they are Bhaniyas, they'll sit together.

31:36.120 --> 31:41.920
If that is not so, then by another name they'll group together.

31:42.440 --> 31:46.600
This is the worst curse of My country,

31:47.240 --> 31:50.640
because once you start grouping together

31:51.000 --> 31:53.400
you can never see the good of others

31:53.680 --> 31:57.200
and you can never see the bad of yourself.

31:57.840 --> 32:03.120
This grouping together can bring lot of problems in this country.

32:06.080 --> 32:10.000
At the time of Christ

32:10.840 --> 32:16.040
they had very different type of people.

32:18.240 --> 32:21.240
Either they were interested in spirituality,

32:21.480 --> 32:23.640
or they were not.

32:24.160 --> 32:29.160
Now we have people here who are interested in spirituality,

32:30.120 --> 32:33.880
but still they - one leg is in the water.

32:36.840 --> 32:42.080
Where the age old problems still exist.

32:45.640 --> 32:50.439
And this is the ruin of our country.

32:51.280 --> 32:54.640
We cannot combine together,

32:55.280 --> 32:58.320
we cannot be friends with each other.

32:58.800 --> 33:01.840
Of course not in Sahaja Yoga, I must say,

33:02.200 --> 33:05.520
it has been solved very well.

33:06.280 --> 33:10.400
But if you see even at the time of Christ,

33:11.160 --> 33:15.600
He had problems with His disciples.

33:17.040 --> 33:21.640
Especially something happened with Peter.

33:23.960 --> 33:25.480
And

33:27.040 --> 33:31.080
He is the one who says a Satan will meet you.

33:31.800 --> 33:35.520
Because I think people

33:35.880 --> 33:39.960
fall into the group of satanic forces.

33:41.280 --> 33:44.600
And He said that He removed the satanic

33:46.280 --> 33:47.840
devils

33:48.360 --> 33:51.560
from many people and put them in the pigs.

33:52.680 --> 33:54.200
It's true.

33:54.480 --> 33:57.280
There is a satanic force

33:57.680 --> 34:00.960
which is working very strongly.

34:01.400 --> 34:05.880
The more we develop security of spirituality,

34:06.080 --> 34:09.160
the more they will develop.

34:09.400 --> 34:14.480
The satanic force is in a different form in the West

34:14.680 --> 34:17.960
and a different form in the East.

34:18.400 --> 34:21.400
But I would like to tell for them

34:22.240 --> 34:25.320
to be careful

34:27.120 --> 34:32.439
how to find out the satanic forces in the West.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.480
You may not be affected by that

34:44.880 --> 34:47.120
because you are realized souls,

34:47.440 --> 34:50.640
but you’ll have to fight it.

34:51.280 --> 34:53.480
You will have to fight it,

34:53.800 --> 34:57.000
for example racialism.

34:58.800 --> 35:05.640
Racialism is still very powerful there, very, very powerful.

35:07.280 --> 35:11.520
And you have to fight racialism

35:12.440 --> 35:16.240
through marrying people who belong to other races.

35:16.680 --> 35:18.720
But still I find difficult

35:18.920 --> 35:23.360
to marry a black person to a white person -

35:24.040 --> 35:27.080
is an impossible situation.

35:27.440 --> 35:31.120
If I try that I don't know what happens.

35:31.439 --> 35:34.600
Once we had such a marriage, I must tell you.

35:35.240 --> 35:42.520
And a white lady, French lady, was married to a black man.

35:43.680 --> 35:49.200
Instead of the French lady dominating, this black man dominated.

35:50.400 --> 35:54.439
So I was quite surprised, you know, how could that be?

35:55.360 --> 35:57.840
So, the reason was,

35:58.120 --> 36:02.320
I think he was taking the revenge maybe, the respite.

36:03.280 --> 36:04.880
So first of all,

36:05.120 --> 36:10.000
tremendous love and affection has to grow

36:10.800 --> 36:13.240
between

36:14.439 --> 36:16.400
the people.

36:16.840 --> 36:21.240
This color is so skin deep.

36:21.920 --> 36:27.880
It has nothing to do with the love inside, nothing.

36:28.560 --> 36:30.280
It's so skin deep.

36:30.560 --> 36:32.680
Thank God in our country,

36:32.920 --> 36:36.240
you can have a wife

36:36.640 --> 36:40.240
who will be very dark, husband will be very fair

36:40.480 --> 36:43.240
or the vice-versa.

36:44.600 --> 36:47.520
But they never look at that from that angle.

36:47.720 --> 36:52.360
I don't think that exists in this country.

36:53.680 --> 36:55.840
But we have another kind, you see,

36:56.080 --> 37:01.640
just is a typical human problem

37:01.840 --> 37:08.920
is that he discriminates. Through ego,

37:10.320 --> 37:11.960
which I must say,

37:12.160 --> 37:18.320
Christ has tried to fight your ego.

37:19.600 --> 37:23.760
He was born in a very humble family

37:24.720 --> 37:26.640
and

37:27.040 --> 37:31.160
He was not a white-skinned man, no.

37:32.360 --> 37:35.080
In your language He was brown,

37:35.440 --> 37:39.320
but in Indian language He was black.

37:42.760 --> 37:46.760
But, when it comes to spirituality,

37:47.240 --> 37:50.240
you just see

37:51.320 --> 37:54.440
the enlightened one.

37:55.600 --> 38:00.360
You don't see what color they have of the skin.

38:02.040 --> 38:05.360
It's very, very superficial.

38:06.080 --> 38:11.400
But this is one of the enemies of the Western life,

38:12.080 --> 38:15.200
I think, which must be conquered

38:16.280 --> 38:19.400
Materialism is another one.

38:20.200 --> 38:25.320
But the worst of all which is against Christ

38:26.040 --> 38:29.040
is immorality.

38:31.080 --> 38:34.840
Immorality is so much accepted in the West.

38:36.200 --> 38:40.160
All kinds of immoral behavior is accepted.

38:41.080 --> 38:45.439
Like, they say that

38:45.840 --> 38:49.439
all these immoral people say, vote for somebody,

38:49.840 --> 38:52.920
he becomes a president of America.

38:53.320 --> 38:58.480
Then it’s all right, doesn't matter, all kinds of immorality is allowed.

38:58.800 --> 39:03.320
But that is absolutely against Christ,

39:06.760 --> 39:09.800
absolutely.

39:12.080 --> 39:14.800
People don't understand

39:15.240 --> 39:19.480
that immorality will lead them

39:21.240 --> 39:23.680
to a kingdom which I don't know what to call because

39:23.880 --> 39:26.680
it's even worse than animal kingdom.

39:28.320 --> 39:33.920
And they are so immoral,

39:35.400 --> 39:38.000
they listen to people like Freud,

39:38.440 --> 39:41.000
as if they have no brains,

39:41.640 --> 39:44.680
they have no spirit,

39:45.640 --> 39:49.440
to take note of such a man.

39:52.240 --> 39:55.320
Only after Sahaja Yoga,

39:57.480 --> 40:01.880
model of Christ's life you can have.

40:02.240 --> 40:06.400
Whatever is past is over and finished.

40:06.880 --> 40:10.040
Today now you are realized souls

40:10.720 --> 40:14.920
and morality is your strength.

40:16.200 --> 40:19.240
Forget about the past,

40:19.600 --> 40:21.760
and I'm sure

40:22.160 --> 40:25.240
you can get many more people

40:25.760 --> 40:29.840
under the banner of Sahaja Yoga

40:30.120 --> 40:34.360
if you lead a very, very moral life.

40:35.840 --> 40:38.680
At the same time,

40:39.200 --> 40:43.120
another very bad

40:45.480 --> 40:49.720
enemy we have is our anger.

40:51.760 --> 40:54.080
So they are very proud, they will say,

40:54.320 --> 40:56.560
"I'll now get angry.

40:57.320 --> 40:59.320
You know, I'm very angry."

40:59.600 --> 41:02.040
They are not ashamed about it

41:02.600 --> 41:06.400
and they go on saying that "I'm very angry,"

41:06.920 --> 41:11.440
as if it's not wrong to say, "I'm very angry."

41:11.760 --> 41:14.240
Now they say, “I hate you.”

41:14.520 --> 41:19.320
I mean, imagine any Indian language, if they use this word

41:19.520 --> 41:23.000
it would be meaning “I'm committing sin.”

41:23.960 --> 41:29.200
So all this aggressiveness comes from anger.

41:31.840 --> 41:34.480
If somebody has to be angry,

41:34.840 --> 41:38.720
he should be angry with himself.

41:40.360 --> 41:44.120
Best is, to get rid of anger,

41:44.720 --> 41:48.920
you can pull your hair, you can bite yourself,

41:49.240 --> 41:55.240
you can use your pillow to hit yourself.

41:57.080 --> 42:03.080
That may be the best way of taking out your anger.

42:03.960 --> 42:06.560
But see for what are you angry?

42:06.960 --> 42:10.120
Sometimes it’s absolutely useless.

42:10.439 --> 42:13.480
Sometimes it has no meaning.

42:13.920 --> 42:15.960
Sometimes

42:16.360 --> 42:21.280
it's absolutely maddening, stupid.

42:24.080 --> 42:29.640
But as long as you stop saying, "I'm very angry,"

42:30.720 --> 42:33.080
that's it.

42:33.800 --> 42:39.600
That's the time you should know you are falling down completely.

42:40.760 --> 42:43.520
So Christ didn't talk of all the subtle things,

42:43.720 --> 42:47.360
I have been talking to you, because that was left to Me.

42:47.720 --> 42:52.040
Without realization, how can you talk about subtler things?

42:52.240 --> 42:54.760
You cannot.

42:57.320 --> 43:01.600
Last time I told you about the vibrations,

43:03.160 --> 43:06.760
what is it, what does it stand for

43:07.360 --> 43:13.360
and how you get the subtle energy which we call as tanmatra,

43:14.160 --> 43:18.800
of our light - tejas,

43:19.520 --> 43:22.520
of water - jala,

43:22.880 --> 43:26.000
and prithvi, agni.

43:26.440 --> 43:33.480
But, I didn't tell you of one very special one

43:35.200 --> 43:40.560
which is, in English language you call  it ether.

43:40.840 --> 43:43.160
But ether is the energy

43:43.439 --> 43:49.960
which is managed by another tanmatra, we call it akash.

43:51.800 --> 43:56.160
It's specially today, because it's Christ

43:56.440 --> 44:02.000
who has sacrificed His life to open our Agnya Chakra,

44:02.480 --> 44:07.000
that we have reached that state of akash.

44:07.760 --> 44:11.320
Without Him it would not have been possible.

44:12.400 --> 44:17.600
We can have general communication.

44:18.439 --> 44:22.480
Like we can talk to people, we can say things,

44:22.680 --> 44:26.920
we can also use our fingers to express ourselves,

44:27.160 --> 44:30.920
our hands to communicate.

44:31.520 --> 44:34.280
But,

44:34.680 --> 44:39.640
to communicate vibrations,

44:40.200 --> 44:42.880
you have to have vibrations.

44:43.240 --> 44:47.280
Otherwise you cannot feel another person.

44:47.960 --> 44:52.120
But if you are at the Agnya level, means you are mental,

44:52.560 --> 44:54.800
absolutely mental,

44:55.120 --> 45:00.640
then your vibrations also are dwindling, in the sense

45:01.080 --> 45:04.120
you don't know what really they are saying.

45:04.400 --> 45:11.400
You can't judge your vibrations, because these vibrations are mental.

45:13.120 --> 45:18.040
They'll say, “Mother, we asked the vibrations.” I said, "Really?"

45:18.320 --> 45:22.960
If you don't have any vibrations, how can you ask the vibrations?

45:23.439 --> 45:24.960
It's very common thing.

45:25.280 --> 45:30.800
“We ask the vibration; we found from the vibrations.”

45:31.440 --> 45:36.680
It's not possible because you are just mental.

45:37.320 --> 45:43.800
Now what Christ has done is to put you away from the mental level.

45:44.120 --> 45:48.480
That is the most difficult. While I’m surprised,

45:48.760 --> 45:53.480
those who follow Christianity have the worst mental position.

45:53.920 --> 45:56.840
They are mentally absolutely there,  like,

45:57.120 --> 46:01.600
I don't know what to call, like the fog of Delhi

46:03.760 --> 46:07.000
that you can't cross.

46:08.280 --> 46:11.520
That’s what was broken was Christ.

46:12.160 --> 46:14.800
How much we should be obliged to Him,

46:15.080 --> 46:22.240
that He removed the greatest hurdle in the human ascent,

46:22.960 --> 46:25.439
and that one was

46:26.640 --> 46:29.000
to break this Agnya,

46:29.360 --> 46:34.680
this mental being within us.

46:37.080 --> 46:40.040
We read like mad,

46:40.720 --> 46:43.760
we listen to people like mad,

46:44.120 --> 46:50.160
we like those who give us feed for our mental being.

46:51.400 --> 46:55.560
They're so mental, so argumentative,

46:55.920 --> 46:58.400
think no end of their intelligence,

46:58.760 --> 47:02.720
that you have to just say, “All right, namaskar.”

47:03.760 --> 47:07.880
You can't fight their mental attitude.

47:09.200 --> 47:12.200
That's why Christ

47:13.240 --> 47:15.520
is to be worshipped

47:15.840 --> 47:19.560
by people who are so very mental.

47:23.680 --> 47:28.120
And this mental nonsense has given

47:28.360 --> 47:31.600
such a sense of superiority to people.

47:31.880 --> 47:36.000
“Oh, whatever we do, what's wrong? What's wrong?”

47:38.720 --> 47:41.040
They cannot correct themselves

47:41.360 --> 47:46.960
because unless and until you cross this limit of mental being,

47:47.400 --> 47:52.200
you cannot see yourself.

47:53.640 --> 47:56.760
You cannot introspect . You cannot see yourself.

47:56.960 --> 48:00.160
You'll see others, “These Sahaja Yogis are like this,

48:00.400 --> 48:03.600
Sahaja Yoga is like that,” all kinds of things.

48:04.000 --> 48:07.320
But you can't see yourself,

48:07.560 --> 48:11.400
because the whole thing is mental.

48:13.560 --> 48:20.400
This mental attitude should be completely curbed

48:21.000 --> 48:27.280
through the help of our Lord Jesus Christ.

48:29.680 --> 48:32.400
But He's also mental,

48:32.640 --> 48:36.280
in your brains Christ is also mental, now what to do?

48:36.520 --> 48:41.280
The One who broke the mental attitude is also a mental -

48:41.480 --> 48:45.720
you have made Him into mental, like a statue

48:46.440 --> 48:49.160
of stone.

48:52.760 --> 48:55.400
So, firstly we have to tell ourselves,

48:55.600 --> 48:59.040
“Now don't think, don't think, don't think, don't think.”

48:59.320 --> 49:01.760
Four times,

49:02.160 --> 49:05.840
and then you can rise above.

49:07.160 --> 49:11.320
And this is very important.

49:12.280 --> 49:17.360
In meditation you have to go beyond the mind.

49:17.800 --> 49:23.000
And thanks to Christ that He’s sitting at the Agnya

49:23.560 --> 49:28.720
to finish off this nonsense of mental being.

49:32.760 --> 49:36.760
I think people should stop reading also perhaps, maybe.

49:37.280 --> 49:40.400
Even My lecture becomes mental, what to do?

49:40.800 --> 49:45.000
I mean everything goes into their head becomes mental, somehow.

49:45.440 --> 49:48.880
And then they ask Me questions, “Mother, did You say it this way,

49:49.120 --> 49:54.560
what did You -” I said, “I said it to make you thoughtless.

49:55.680 --> 49:58.080
Just to stun you,

49:58.280 --> 50:04.000
I didn’t say this to sit down and analyze and do, no, no.

50:04.400 --> 50:11.439
I said this that you become absolutely shocked and stunned.”

50:15.080 --> 50:19.760
So the best thing for all of you is

50:20.040 --> 50:23.920
to become thoughtless.

50:24.840 --> 50:27.400
That’s the blessing of Christ,

50:27.600 --> 50:31.240
that’s what He worked it out for you.

50:32.720 --> 50:35.320
And I am sure,

50:35.720 --> 50:40.080
if you work it out that don’t pay attention to others.

50:42.480 --> 50:45.240
Don’t react,

50:45.560 --> 50:47.520
just don’t react.

50:47.760 --> 50:51.040
Everything they will see, they’ll react.

50:51.440 --> 50:54.320
What is the need?

50:55.040 --> 50:57.600
What is the use?

50:57.920 --> 51:02.520
What are you going to do with that reaction?

51:06.400 --> 51:10.760
This reaction creates nothing but ripples of thoughts

51:11.080 --> 51:14.320
in your mind, I’ve told you hundreds of times.

51:14.520 --> 51:18.520
And now you have to become

51:19.080 --> 51:22.400
absolutely thoughtless

51:23.160 --> 51:25.720
after this puja.

51:26.120 --> 51:31.200
If that happens, I think we have achieved a lot.

51:31.760 --> 51:36.200
That’s the biggest blessing that Christ has given you,

51:36.560 --> 51:40.400
which you should really enjoy.

51:41.680 --> 51:47.400
Then only this Akash Tattwa in you will work.

51:48.400 --> 51:51.040
And how it works?

51:52.240 --> 51:54.960
Through your attention,

51:55.360 --> 51:58.439
it works with Me as you know.

51:58.800 --> 52:02.480
With My attention I work out many things.

52:02.840 --> 52:05.440
How?

52:05.800 --> 52:09.960
Just My attention has become thoughtless,

52:10.520 --> 52:13.280
just thoughtless.

52:13.640 --> 52:16.680
It goes wherever it goes, it works.

52:17.040 --> 52:21.840
But if you put your attention for thought all the time

52:22.280 --> 52:24.800
for thinking,

52:25.120 --> 52:30.240
then it doesn’t do the work that it has supposed to do.

52:31.840 --> 52:35.480
Attention works marvelously

52:37.320 --> 52:41.080
if you are thoughtless, otherwise it doesn’t.

52:43.320 --> 52:49.680
So it has to rise from your own self.

52:51.120 --> 52:54.240
Then from others

52:54.560 --> 52:58.240
to the higher level of humanity,

52:58.480 --> 53:02.320
where you are in communication with the sky,

53:02.760 --> 53:05.360
with, we can call it as the

53:05.840 --> 53:11.480
tanmatra, or the essential, or the essence

53:12.120 --> 53:14.680
of ether.

53:16.200 --> 53:19.960
With ether you can have television, you can have telephone.

53:20.160 --> 53:22.280
It's a miracle otherwise.

53:22.520 --> 53:25.520
But with this tanmatra,

53:26.000 --> 53:28.040
sitting down here

53:28.440 --> 53:31.439
you can do the job.

53:31.800 --> 53:34.040
It works,

53:34.320 --> 53:37.520
just attention works. I know that.

53:37.880 --> 53:39.600
You also know very well.

53:39.840 --> 53:43.280
You don't have to ask Me to put the attention,

53:43.600 --> 53:47.000
you just put the attention and it will work out.

53:47.480 --> 53:52.320
It’s a very important thing that you have got.

53:52.840 --> 53:56.400
I think that is the first thing -

53:56.720 --> 53:59.040
once you have,

53:59.320 --> 54:01.840
no problem.

54:02.920 --> 54:09.080
But we start manifesting from the earth element.

54:10.280 --> 54:15.040
Then from the agni element, then from the jala element,

54:15.640 --> 54:19.840
and then we come to tejas,

54:20.480 --> 54:24.240
where the face starts shining.

54:25.040 --> 54:29.480
But lastly we get this thoughtless awareness

54:29.680 --> 54:35.160
by which our attention is absolutely free to do

54:35.840 --> 54:38.640
some special work.

54:39.240 --> 54:42.080
But if you are all the time thinking,

54:42.440 --> 54:45.520
then poor this attention

54:46.080 --> 54:49.760
is so busy, you know, so very busy.

54:50.400 --> 54:53.160
You don't have to ask Me then,

54:53.360 --> 54:56.439
"Mother, please pay attention." You can pay attention,

54:56.720 --> 54:59.280
and you can work it out.

55:03.560 --> 55:09.640
In this attention, you don't feel

55:10.000 --> 55:13.040
what you've got, what you are standing,

55:13.280 --> 55:19.760
what you are wearing, what others are doing - no, nothing.

55:20.760 --> 55:24.040
You are one with yourself.

55:25.000 --> 55:30.000
And it's a life full of humor.

55:31.080 --> 55:33.880
So much humor.

55:34.240 --> 55:36.440
So much of joy.

55:36.640 --> 55:39.560
So much of happiness

55:39.840 --> 55:42.840
that you don't care for anything

55:43.120 --> 55:46.160
that normally people care for.

55:50.360 --> 55:52.440
So,

55:52.800 --> 55:59.120
as it is now Sahaja Yoga has worked in so many countries.

55:59.600 --> 56:02.920
I'm so very proud of you, very proud.

56:03.400 --> 56:06.960
And now it is also going to African countries,

56:07.160 --> 56:11.440
is a very great satisfaction for Me.

56:13.920 --> 56:17.040
And you all can do it;

56:17.360 --> 56:19.960
you all can work it out.

56:20.240 --> 56:25.080
Only thing, become thoughtlessly aware,

56:25.440 --> 56:27.520
as the blessing of Christ.

56:27.800 --> 56:29.920
If it works,

56:30.120 --> 56:36.640
you will be absolutely enjoying yourself.

56:37.640 --> 56:40.640
So may God bless you.
