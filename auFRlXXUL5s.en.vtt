WEBVTT

09:07.274 --> 09:10.276
You have come here to learn

09:10.276 --> 09:14.429
something, to go deep into your experiences

09:14.429 --> 09:21.278
of the knowledge of your roots.

09:21.278 --> 09:26.487
Shri Krishna has said that this is

09:26.487 --> 09:30.230
a tree which is upside down, the

09:30.230 --> 09:34.218
roots are upwards and the

09:34.218 --> 09:37.177
leaves are outwards.

09:37.177 --> 09:39.927
In the same way, you

09:39.927 --> 09:43.386
know that Kundalini, really, when

09:43.386 --> 09:47.112
it rises in the Sahasrara or above

09:47.112 --> 09:50.377
Sahasrara, then you start getting the

09:50.377 --> 09:55.770
feeling of Kundalini. So, one has to

09:55.770 --> 09:59.764
understand that when we are now getting

09:59.764 --> 10:02.818
subtler and subtler and trying to

10:02.818 --> 10:05.380
feel the Kundalini, we should try to

10:05.380 --> 10:10.585
get out of materialistic attitude and

10:10.585 --> 10:13.650
materialistic viewpoint and materialistic

10:13.650 --> 10:17.839
sticking point. I had met one

10:17.839 --> 10:20.308
guru before, because you know I went

10:20.308 --> 10:23.112
to all of them. And I asked one of

10:23.112 --> 10:26.046
them, I said, why do you take money,

10:26.046 --> 10:29.055
so much money from these people who

10:29.055 --> 10:32.111
are western people? So much, why do you

10:32.111 --> 10:35.273
take and just they become beggars,
absolutely, like beggars they become

10:35.273 --> 10:38.308
because you charge them so much and

10:38.308 --> 10:43.101
so heavily? And he told me that unless

10:43.101 --> 10:45.329
and until you make them beggars

10:45.329 --> 10:47.858
they will never take to God. They are

10:47.858 --> 10:50.949
too rich to be near God. I mean,

10:50.949 --> 10:54.508
this explanation I just could not

10:54.508 --> 10:57.768
understand. It was absurd, I could not

10:57.768 --> 11:03.510
understand: How can this explanation
have any proper meaning that you should

11:03.510 --> 11:06.502
make people beggars and
then they be nearer to God?

11:06.502 --> 11:08.819
I said, in India we have
many beggars; do you think

11:08.819 --> 11:12.699
those beggars are nearer to God??So he

11:12.699 --> 11:14.949
said, 揘o, otherwise, you see, they get

11:14.949 --> 11:17.332
stuck up with their money and you

11:17.332 --> 11:20.669
must just make them absolutely without

11:20.669 --> 11:23.941
any money, moneyless people.

11:23.941 --> 11:31.734
So, I mean, of course to such a
stupid person what can you talk?

11:31.734 --> 11:33.364
What can you convince?

11:33.364 --> 11:38.960
I couldn't say to him, then
why are you taking the money, if you are?

11:38.960 --> 11:44.025
Then he would have said,
because I am detached.?

11:44.025 --> 11:50.617
You see, anything one can say like that. If you
start like that, you cannot just stop it.

11:50.617 --> 11:56.559
But one has to understand that
materialism has gone into our roots.

11:56.559 --> 12:02.091
And if we have to clear out our roots
we must get out of materialism.

12:02.091 --> 12:05.930
That's important, but that does not
in any way mean that you torture your

12:05.930 --> 12:08.141
body or anything, I dont mean that.

12:08.141 --> 12:10.991
But what Iam saying, your attention.

12:10.991 --> 12:15.984
[Shri Mataji addresses some
children] you shouldn't do like that.

12:16.010 --> 12:19.940
Always Natali you get up which you know is not
good.Always disturb is not good.Sit Down.

12:19.940 --> 12:22.392
Now even if there are so many
childrens sitting down here.

12:22.392 --> 12:25.526
Please sit down and dont
disturb any more sit down.

12:25.526 --> 12:28.793
Sonu come and sit here. Sonu come here.Better....
and then she gets the diarrhea always.

12:36.322 --> 12:49.607
You are not here just to enjoy but you are here for a
puja do you understand that. You are grown up girl now.

12:49.633 --> 13:27.723
Look at all these children's how they are sitting quitely.Will they move out? they don't understand English.I have seen all our English children whether it is in Caxton hall or whether it is any hall all of them must go out and
make a big noise and play there. It's always seen they cannot sit down. Look at them these children how quitely they are sitting. What a quality it is! They are just feeling the vibrations and they are enjoying it. They dont want

13:27.749 --> 14:44.230
to go out.There is no enjoyment outside. Its inside. See them. See the contrast.You must keep eyes open to see. See our children. Now Linda is there she will tell you. She has to manage the children outside the caxton hall.They are shouting,screaming and the caxton hall people will always tell me that its better not have childrens for your program because they make suchh a lot of noise. Its very common problem. They have atleast told me 10 times that please
don't allow children to come in. But the children will never sit quitely even for 5 minutes. As soon as 5 min. will start they will say lets go out.. They can't sit quitely. Poor Sonu whenever she goes out she gets a diarrhea. .....All right Orea you sit somewhere out from there separately. You also.You have only here 3 childrens and you will always see them walking about. and another is Mathews where is he? I have to keep eye on them. It's dangerous.

14:45.816 --> 14:50.151
So now, when we are
dealing with our

14:50.862 --> 14:55.564
roots we have to be in the centre.

14:55.564 --> 15:00.478
In the core. In the core mean we are

15:00.478 --> 15:05.480
taking in, sucking in the feeling

15:05.480 --> 15:07.730
or you can say the?

15:07.714 --> 15:15.285
Feeling and awareness put together, what do you
say to that in English, is there any word?

15:15.285 --> 15:19.550
Is there any word which makes
awareness and feeling put together?

15:19.550 --> 15:24.811
Is there Gavin?

15:24.811 --> 15:28.133
[answer: Experience]

15:28.133 --> 15:30.650
Oh, yeah, experience, you can say the

15:30.692 --> 15:34.403
experience into your awareness and feeling.

15:34.403 --> 15:39.131
You have to get the experience
into your awareness and feeling.

15:39.131 --> 15:42.832
In Marathi it is a very simple word janiv

15:42.832 --> 15:45.109
comes from the word ja.

15:45.109 --> 15:50.569
Ja comes the word spontaneous.

15:50.569 --> 15:53.222
Also ja has two meanings:

15:53.222 --> 16:01.888
Ja also means dnyana, awareness, and
also it means spontaneous. Janiv.

16:01.888 --> 16:12.252
So you start sucking that within yourself, when
you are not entangled into other things.

16:12.252 --> 16:17.152
If your attention is entangled
outside, you cannot enjoy.

16:17.152 --> 16:21.441
So, to be lost into which is
samaadhi you see, is the one where

16:21.441 --> 16:26.016
your attention is completely
drowned into the experience.

16:26.016 --> 16:29.642
That iswhat we have to achieve.

16:29.642 --> 16:34.431
So it is  not only materialism: also emotionalism, all kinds of "isms".

16:34.431 --> 16:37.773
We are attacked by all kind of isms?

16:37.773 --> 16:44.896
since the history of word started in this
world I think and now the unholy thing that

16:44.896 --> 16:50.648
the ism? latest is, could be sahaja
Yoga-ism?

16:50.648 --> 16:57.326
also could be the greatest word because now
there has to be an attack on Sahaja Yoga also.

16:57.326 --> 17:06.618
In this one is that as I told you, I didnt explain
it properly or you didnt hear Me properly that day,

17:06.618 --> 17:20.027
that Sahaja Yoga does not mean lethargy or
slowness, not at all, but is a quick and a fast

17:20.027 --> 17:24.662
stepping in into the dissolution.

17:24.662 --> 17:27.724
Very quick.

17:27.724 --> 17:31.619
And once you very quickly

17:31.619 --> 17:34.569
dissolve into it, the whole movement

17:34.569 --> 17:36.411
of your body is quick but not jerky,

17:36.411 --> 17:44.261
is smooth and quick. Rhythmic. Is musical,

17:44.261 --> 17:47.427
neither is awkward nor lethargic,

17:47.427 --> 17:50.503
but is musical. It has a rhythm about

17:50.503 --> 17:54.466
it. Is very gracious.

17:54.466 --> 17:59.056
The whole movement of dissolution can happen

17:59.056 --> 18:04.301
to you very easily if you don't allow

18:04.301 --> 18:11.628
your attention to be attacked by all these "isms."

18:11.628 --> 18:13.157
There is no end to it.

18:13.157 --> 18:17.407
I mean, if I have to write all of them I
think we will have to need at least one book

18:17.407 --> 18:23.492
to write all the ism's of the world, there
is no end to it, which we have created.

18:23.492 --> 18:27.799
Then the worst of all is now,
I think, Sahaja Yoga-ism

18:27.799 --> 18:35.046
in which first of all is
the feeling of lethargy:

18:35.046 --> 18:40.229
"It will happen Sahaja. Sit down,
Mother will do everything for you."

18:40.229 --> 18:43.448
Another is Sahaja Yoga-egoism

18:43.448 --> 18:47.218
in which we haven't got one fellow lying there.

18:47.218 --> 18:55.372
In which people, Sahaja Yogis, get into tantrums, try
to show off that they are great Sahaja Yogis.

18:55.372 --> 19:01.300
they have reached the third stage
or the seventh stage or whatever they may be.

19:01.300 --> 19:07.048
Now it's good this example is a very
good example, I wish you had taken up.

19:07.048 --> 19:13.489
But see the expression of the Indian,

19:13.489 --> 19:15.973
the enamoured expressions. You see, it

19:15.973 --> 19:19.943
so genuine, they can't control within themselves, seeing Me.

19:19.943 --> 19:27.302
Now, see, it's like, I just don't know, but people
think it's a package deal sort of a thing.

19:27.302 --> 19:30.728
It's so nonsensical, I tell you. That either

19:30.728 --> 19:32.888
they could be taken out all their money

19:32.888 --> 19:38.245
or if they are to be told now for puja.
All of them are paying twenty-one

19:38.245 --> 19:43.781
because they have to do this or this extra work, so
they are charging twenty-one.

19:43.781 --> 19:47.595
And if you tell them [it’s] for puja they
will even give them fifty-one.

19:47.595 --> 19:55.797
But I have told some of you have even refused
that. I mean it's so shameful, I tell you!

19:55.797 --> 20:00.469
It's absolutely shameful! Can you imagine?

20:00.469 --> 20:02.630
What is twenty-one rupees to you?

20:02.630 --> 20:10.276
To them it's quite a lot, because it's some sort of
part of you you are giving which is so nonsensical.

20:10.276 --> 20:19.212
Just is a feeling. Is a sign of complete negativity. Left Nabhi.

20:19.212 --> 20:22.816
It's a problem. Materialism
it's complete materialism.

20:22.816 --> 20:30.913
Those who have been, say, doing
vegetarianism are materialists in India,

20:30.913 --> 20:39.685
we have seen the cases, like you see the Jains
and the Marvari and the Gujaratis.

20:39.685 --> 20:45.539
They are all vegetarians, supposed to be compassionate people.

20:45.539 --> 20:51.187
They build some temples also and sometimes
they give to poor people also and

20:51.187 --> 20:55.176
sometimes to people like Hare-Rama-Hare-Krishna
who are begging in India.

20:55.176 --> 20:59.511
They give money to them. Supposed to be very compassionate

20:59.511 --> 21:03.866
They are more compassionate to
chickens than to human beings.

21:03.866 --> 21:06.355
We have that kind.

21:06.355 --> 21:13.264
And the same kind I have seen in the
West also. Such materialistic people,

21:13.264 --> 21:20.234
I mean, they have no shame.
So when you just turn and

21:20.260 --> 21:26.841
see that, should abhor that.
Abhor it. It's shameful!

21:26.904 --> 21:30.169
How could you be like that even
in Sahaja Yoga?

21:30.211 --> 21:35.757
So as I have told you, there are
some people who are materialistic,

21:35.757 --> 21:42.429
some people who are emotionalistic
and some people who are egoistic.

21:42.429 --> 21:47.735
Now leave all these things on the
sides, then you come in the centre.

21:47.735 --> 21:50.777
Now you are in the centre.

21:50.777 --> 21:58.641
In the centre, people enjoy just the love
of their Mother, like Shri Ganesha does.

21:58.641 --> 22:06.486
Just think how your Mother loves you. Finished!
Can you? It’s a very sweet feeling

22:06.486 --> 22:09.802
And who is your Mother if you
really believe in Her, in Sahaja

22:09.802 --> 22:16.222
Yoga, these two things should solve the problem.
No more thinking.

22:16.222 --> 22:18.753
Just think how much your Mother loves.

22:18.800 --> 22:27.269
That means you are jumping onto My Kundalini
and when you jump onto My Kundalini,

22:27.269 --> 22:33.657
then there is no thought.
You cannot think.

22:33.657 --> 22:41.776
When you think that, how much your Mother loves
you, you are jumping onto My Kundalini. And

22:41.776 --> 22:45.070
that time, there is no thought.

22:45.070 --> 22:48.409
It is very simple to
meditate in Sahaja Yoga

22:48.409 --> 22:51.149
because you have somebody in person.

22:51.149 --> 22:54.461
They never had somebody in person.

22:54.532 --> 22:56.922
So I can understand their problems-

22:56.962 --> 22:59.139
there was nobody in person;

22:59.181 --> 23:02.854
they had to do it in the air.

23:02.854 --> 23:09.239
But here a sure-shot thing:
you can feel your vibrations

23:09.239 --> 23:19.587
you can feel My love and you
can feel your own quality.

23:19.587 --> 23:26.070
It's very simple.

23:26.070 --> 23:34.224
But it's not the love that is selfish, it's not the love where you

23:34.224 --> 23:37.688
say, Oh Mother loves me so She look after me,
She will do everything for me,

23:37.688 --> 23:42.608
She is going to do
everything.

23:42.608 --> 23:48.184
It's the love that other loves me so much,
what can I do for Her?

23:48.184 --> 23:53.918
Which is the best flower I can give to my Mother?

23:53.918 --> 23:56.717
What does She need? She needs nothing.

23:56.717 --> 24:03.600
She doesn't need money, She doesn't need anything.
What can I give Her?

24:03.600 --> 24:06.196
Which is the best flower

24:06.196 --> 24:14.368
Like Shri Hanuman was given a gold necklace by Shri Sitaji.

24:14.368 --> 24:19.271
And He saw that, and He was sitting on a tree and

24:19.271 --> 24:29.025
He was breaking one by one all of those
big-big gold balls of His necklace.

24:29.025 --> 24:32.733
So Sitaji said, what are you doing?

24:32.733 --> 24:38.237
He said, "I am trying to see in these balls where is Ram."

24:38.237 --> 24:46.597
He said, none of them has, so I am just breaking
them to find out. Otherwise why should I wear it?

24:46.597 --> 24:49.870
And then She said, "Really? Where is Ram?"

24:49.870 --> 24:57.273
He opened His chest. He said,
see in My chest. He exists there.

24:57.273 --> 25:02.507
So it is never a one-sided sort
of a thing. It is a thing that

25:02.507 --> 25:06.845
exists within you and you feel that
and then has to be reciprocal.

25:06.845 --> 25:19.573
In the water, if there is a ripple it goes
to the shores and then it returns back.

25:19.573 --> 25:28.494
So with this force only, I tell you, you
can conquer your ego and superego.

25:28.494 --> 25:34.583
There is no way out.

25:34.583 --> 25:40.449
And for these Indians it is very easy to do because they

25:40.449 --> 25:45.710
know their Mother's love.

25:45.710 --> 25:50.674
I know there has been an attack on that point and

25:50.674 --> 25:52.790
the mothers have been funny there.

25:52.790 --> 25:57.806
But doesn't matter; when you see
something, just put yourself to it.

25:57.806 --> 26:02.762
To feel your roots.

26:02.762 --> 26:07.862
These are your roots. And then you see the enjoyment.

26:07.862 --> 26:11.409
The Mother Earth Herself
is sucking you now.

26:11.409 --> 26:18.226
She is sucking you down.

26:18.226 --> 26:20.675
That is how you meditate now.

26:20.718 --> 26:26.485
This is how you have to meditate, and it's
such a security giving thing.

26:26.485 --> 26:30.577
It will change your expressions, faces, everything.

26:30.577 --> 26:42.784
And that enamoured expressions that you find in these
people will be on your face very soon

26:42.784 --> 26:51.714
And complete silence will exist once you come on My Kundalini.

26:51.714 --> 27:03.787
But not through your mental projections, but
through your meditative, spontaneous experience.

27:03.787 --> 27:07.477
It's very joygiving.

27:07.477 --> 27:10.326
Just feel the joy of that.

27:10.326 --> 27:18.590
You are all with Me here and the joy of that
feeling will really enlarge your hearts,

27:18.590 --> 27:24.318
and then, then you can give it to others.

27:24.318 --> 27:27.814
You don't have to be crazy about these things,

27:27.814 --> 27:36.286
but just to feel it within yourself.

27:36.286 --> 27:42.435
All right. Now I move on to Indians because

27:42.435 --> 27:46.541
they are a different style of people.

27:46.541 --> 27:51.196
May God bless you!

27:51.196 --> 27:53.407
(Marathi talk)

40:43.363 --> 40:45.373
Now, I was telling them, I must

40:45.373 --> 40:50.798
translate it to you in English is the
most important point

40:50.798 --> 40:56.373
I was telling that now you are transformed,
now you have become saints, no doubt of it.

40:56.373 --> 40:59.292
Now from an egg you have become a bird,

40:59.292 --> 41:05.634
but, now what should happen to you?
Your Kundalini is still in the sacrum.

41:05.634 --> 41:10.874
How it has happened that now you
have got all the Ganesha Shakti?

41:10.874 --> 41:17.486
I have made you like Ganesha, in the same
pattern as I had made Ganesha you are made.

41:17.353 --> 41:25.339
Now you have become a Ganesha,
and from this Ganesha stage,

41:25.339 --> 41:34.723
which you think you are a Ganesha now,
if I offer you a throne of Shri Ganesha,

41:34.723 --> 41:40.263
if you have to sit on that throne
as a king, then what should happen?

41:40.263 --> 41:45.536
Actually, that now your Kundalini should
not be anymore in the sacrum bone,

41:45.536 --> 41:50.627
but in your stomach, because Ganesha's
Kundalini is in the stomach.

41:50.627 --> 41:53.890
In the stomach means in the Nabhi Chakra.

41:53.890 --> 42:00.476
Means all your seeking has been
so far in materialism,

42:00.476 --> 42:06.180
has been in other things like in money, or in

42:06.180 --> 42:10.578
power or in love or whatever it was.

42:10.578 --> 42:15.909
But now your Kundalini itself
is in the Nabhi Chakra, means

42:15.909 --> 42:20.801
your seeking is nothing but
itself has become the Kundalini.

42:20.801 --> 42:27.128
Your seeking has become the Kundalini,
means that you are the giver,

42:27.128 --> 42:31.039
now you are the Guru, you have
now become the Guru.

42:31.039 --> 42:37.000
When the Kundalini starts from the Nabhi
that means now you are the Guru,

42:37.000 --> 42:43.360
now you have to give all the
blessings,everything, as a Guru does.

42:43.360 --> 42:45.899
Now you all have become Gurus.

42:45.899 --> 42:48.969
But that's only possible when the Kundalini has risen,

42:48.969 --> 42:54.915
has lifted Her abode from the sacrum
to the stomach,

42:54.915 --> 43:00.330
and this stage, unless and until it has
arrived, you are not a confirmed Guru.

43:00.330 --> 43:03.597
Once that has happened you
become a Guru and then

43:03.597 --> 43:09.661
you can really impress
people and work it out.

43:09.661 --> 43:11.881
It has to be done very fast.

43:11.881 --> 43:15.633
It has to work out very fast
and for that, first of all,

43:15.633 --> 43:19.088
please get rid of your
entanglements which are stupid.

43:19.088 --> 43:22.944
If you really believe that you
have to progress in your seeking,

43:22.944 --> 43:27.875
that you have to have your Kundalini
coming up from your Nabhi,

43:27.875 --> 43:35.674
then please, please hurry up, please try to
work out, otherwise you are very few who

43:35.674 --> 43:44.552
have been given also the privilege of
doing My Puja, very few.

43:44.552 --> 43:47.815
And those who have been given have a chance

43:47.815 --> 43:50.827
to develop to that stage, and
once you become that, all

43:50.827 --> 43:56.391
of you who have achieved that
stage can become the Gurus.

43:56.391 --> 44:00.026
And for that, you have to have only wisdom.

44:00.026 --> 44:03.235
Wisdom, keep to your wisdom,

44:03.235 --> 44:08.903
and like Shri Ganesha has His
wisdom and in that wisdom He knew

44:08.903 --> 44:12.025
one thing: that His Mother was all powerful

44:12.025 --> 44:16.566
and that He doesn't have to worship
anybody else but His Mother.

44:16.566 --> 44:21.730
And He has to have all the
powers which are granted by Her.

44:21.730 --> 44:27.608
His powers, no one, even Brahma,
Vishnu, Mahesha does not have.

44:27.608 --> 44:29.528
They cannot reach Ganesha;

44:29.528 --> 44:33.313
They cannot reach His stage because
They are one-sided but

44:33.313 --> 44:37.283
Shri Ganesha has all the powers,
all the Chaitanya powers He has.

44:37.283 --> 44:41.254
So to become like that, to be like
that,He should be your ideal:

44:41.254 --> 44:47.952
how He behaved and how He would sacrifice
anything for the sake of Mother.

44:47.952 --> 44:54.518
Here there are people who don't even
want to pay for something like a puja and ..stuff

44:54.518 --> 44:58.912
which you may just spend away
somewhere in nonsensical things,

44:58.912 --> 45:02.993
because your attention has to
be brought round completely.

45:02.993 --> 45:09.215
It has to be completely severed from
all these nonsensical entanglements

45:09.215 --> 45:13.672
and there should be less talking and more experiencing.

45:13.672 --> 45:17.802
Then only it's going to work out.

45:17.802 --> 45:26.444
It's a good pleasure and a great
thing to be here in this holy land,

45:26.444 --> 45:29.909
it's a very holy place
you can see it, so peaceful.

45:29.909 --> 45:32.835
Try to feel the peace within yourself that

45:32.835 --> 45:36.453
is within every human being and after

45:36.453 --> 45:38.417
that you have to know that this

45:38.417 --> 45:42.336
peace that you are achieving
has to be given to others.

45:42.336 --> 45:47.771
In Sahaja Yoga, perhaps you have realized,
whatever you have got from the nature,

45:47.771 --> 45:50.388
you can release it back.

45:50.388 --> 45:55.578
For example if you give vibrations
to a plant you can make it grow.

45:55.578 --> 46:01.353
If you give vibrations to a flower
you can make it sustain its life.

46:01.353 --> 46:04.600
For the first time you are giving
something to the nature,

46:04.600 --> 46:08.376
but as soon as you grow up to that state of a

46:08.376 --> 46:11.271
Guru then you can give the peace

46:11.271 --> 46:18.531
that is in the nature, you can give the
feeling of bliss that is in the nature.

46:18.531 --> 46:21.798
But first achieve it within yourself.

46:21.798 --> 46:28.386
Make this go inside you and see
that bliss settle down within you.

46:28.386 --> 46:32.055
You don't see other nonsensical
things which are very disturbing

46:32.055 --> 46:34.146
sometimes to your western mind.

46:34.146 --> 46:41.310
For example if a telephone is not working or the road is not all right, if the
bathroom is not this.

46:41.310 --> 46:47.680
These nonsensical things have no meaning, but
feel the peace outside,

46:47.680 --> 46:56.808
try to establish that peace within because
this peace you have to give to others.

46:56.808 --> 47:00.936
The whole development plan
that I have is very fast

47:00.936 --> 47:03.715
and I am sure you will keep pace with me.

47:03.715 --> 47:04.786
So may God bless you!

47:04.786 --> 47:11.693
When you sit down just feel the peace and
try to achieve that peace within yourself.

47:11.693 --> 47:16.615
Don't pay attention to nonsensical
things and this with this your little

47:16.615 --> 47:21.404
brain trying to criticize, but try to
achieve the peace within yourself so

47:21.404 --> 47:24.782
that you can give peace to others.

47:24.782 --> 47:30.938
It's not proper that some of you are looking after
the negative people all the time, it's not proper.

47:30.938 --> 47:32.803
You don't have to look
after the negative people.

47:32.803 --> 47:34.426
Just leave them alone.

47:34.426 --> 47:38.879
Keep out of that because negative
people can always bring you down.

47:38.879 --> 47:43.770
Don't try to improve the conditions of the
negative, leave them behind. You go fast.

47:43.770 --> 47:49.683
Once you have achieved that state
then we can arrange for them to come.

47:49.683 --> 47:53.727
For example, if My car has failed, all
right, I got into another car, which

47:53.727 --> 47:56.299
was all right because I have to come to the program.

47:56.299 --> 47:59.721
Then I can send the tempo
from here to get that another

47:59.721 --> 48:04.526
car where there were some people who
were not supposed to be at the program.

48:04.526 --> 48:08.645
That's how you have to be quick and
not bother your heads too much

48:08.645 --> 48:12.982
about the negative people who are sick
people, trying to be compassionate.

48:12.982 --> 48:13.967
There is no need.

48:13.967 --> 48:15.480
Tell them, tell Mother.

48:15.480 --> 48:16.974
Let you talk to Mother.

48:16.974 --> 48:20.512
Look after yourselves and
don't be bothered about them.

48:20.512 --> 48:23.811
This is another nonsensical
idea of compassion you have got.

48:23.811 --> 48:26.866
Compassion is not mental projection I told you:

48:26.866 --> 48:29.638
the compassion that works, that flows.

48:29.638 --> 48:33.610
It's all mental you see for us
compassion is mental, every idea,

48:33.610 --> 48:39.205
peace is mental, bliss is mental, God
is mental, everything is mental for us.

48:39.205 --> 48:45.874
He is not. He is the one that
resides in the heart as Spirit.

48:45.874 --> 48:48.472
He is the one who works
through the compassion.

48:48.472 --> 48:54.594
And now you know My compassion is
that it flows, it works, it acts.

48:54.594 --> 48:59.512
It's not mental.

48:59.512 --> 49:05.089
So don't try to be mentally concerned
with people and try to be compassionate.

49:05.089 --> 49:06.062
All right?

49:06.062 --> 49:10.558
I hope you understand that the
compassion is not a mental idea

49:10.558 --> 49:15.030
that we are compassionate, we are working
for the unity of the world.And all that.

49:15.030 --> 49:20.577
Even unity and all those ideas, even
the idea of collective understanding

49:20.577 --> 49:25.042
is in the heart, it should work.

49:25.042 --> 49:28.586
In Sanskrit it is Kaaryanvit.

49:28.586 --> 49:31.789
In English there is no word. Kaaryanvit

49:31.789 --> 49:34.680
is embodied with the working capacity,

49:34.680 --> 49:37.531
embodied with the working out capacity

49:37.531 --> 49:40.567
actually working out capacity
you can translate like that.

49:40.567 --> 49:41.607
It should work.

49:41.607 --> 49:45.959
If it does not work out then what's the use
of looking after somebody who is sick?

49:45.959 --> 49:50.808
all right, come along This is
nonsense, this is very mental.

49:50.808 --> 49:59.052
Just don't waste your energy; you have
not come here to look after the sick.

49:59.052 --> 50:06.083
I hope you understand this idea of looking after the
sick and being very

50:06.083 --> 50:09.348
is all ego-oriented, see we are trying to help the sick,

50:09.348 --> 50:13.217
we are trying to help this, that,?all ego-oriented.

50:13.217 --> 50:17.813
Another superego-oriented that we
are sacrificing this and that and

50:17.813 --> 50:22.879
we are becoming beggars in India like the
Hare-Rama-Hare-Krishna. Beggars, parasites.

50:22.879 --> 50:26.418
Both are just the same, now
please don't do all these things

50:26.418 --> 50:35.935
and try to keep yourself glued to one ideal:

50:35.935 --> 50:39.349
that you have to ascend faster.

50:39.349 --> 50:45.762
You have to individually ascend faster
and collectively pull out everyone

50:45.762 --> 50:50.490
but not those who are heavily
laden with problems and

50:50.490 --> 50:53.896
who are creating problems and
objecting your progress.

50:53.896 --> 50:57.729
That doesn't mean that you are
not compassionate.

50:57.729 --> 51:03.863
You know how much compassion that I have but
My compassion doesn't make stories,

51:03.863 --> 51:06.924
I am so compassionate and I am this and that.

51:06.944 --> 51:12.195
Up to a point is all right but don't so too much
bother about people who are dragging you behind.

51:12.195 --> 51:14.705
You have come here for a training,

51:14.705 --> 51:23.054
a training into the understanding
of awareness which is compassion.

51:23.054 --> 51:27.285
You all have to, even, when you go to the
school, you are not bothered about a person

51:27.285 --> 51:30.942
who is lacking in the
class, do you?

51:30.942 --> 51:33.700
You want to study fast so that you come up well.

51:33.700 --> 51:37.153
In the same way, I would
request you not to bother your

51:37.153 --> 51:41.166
heads too much about people who
are trying to pull you down

51:41.166 --> 51:44.092
because I don't want you to be pulled down.

51:44.092 --> 51:50.324
That's My compassion for them and for you.

51:50.324 --> 51:53.244
Let Me look after them and you just
don't worry your heads about them.

51:53.244 --> 51:56.307
They will be all right.

51:56.307 --> 51:57.463
So, may God bless you!

51:57.463 --> 52:04.533
Lets have a puja today, and
this puja will be simple today.

52:04.533 --> 52:10.194
I think we will have Ganesha's Puja and
then we will have Devi's Puja today,

52:10.273 --> 52:16.900
and then we will have a good havan.
That is a good place for havan.
