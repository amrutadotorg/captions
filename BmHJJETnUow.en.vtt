Shri Krishna Puja Talk
Cabella Ligure, Italy

00:00:01.754 --> 00:00:02.754
August 16, 1998

00:13:25.945 --> 00:13:29.955
Today we are going to have Shri Krishna Puja.

00:13:30.319 --> 00:13:50.349
It is a very important thing about the power
of Shri Krishna that gives you a witness state.

00:13:50.349 --> 00:14:06.669
This is very important also because, in these
days of Kali Yuga and complete confusion of

00:14:06.669 --> 00:14:26.410
value system, all kinds of turmoil makes a
very complex conditions to exist.

00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:42.870
The state of witnessing is only possible through
meditation: you reach the state of thoughtless

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:43.870
awareness.

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:48.429
It’s combined together.

00:14:48.429 --> 00:14:55.850
Now the witness state is such a state where
you just do not react.

00:14:55.850 --> 00:15:08.249
If you react, then the problem starts.

00:15:08.249 --> 00:15:23.790
It’s a very simple thing to understand that
we react through our ego or through our conditioning.

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:35.480
Otherwise there is no way to react.

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:40.000
Anything, now for example there is a beautiful
carpet here.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:54.100
As soon as I look at it, if I use My ego I’ll
start thinking, “Now from where did they

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:55.870
get it?

00:15:55.870 --> 00:16:00.290
How much they paid it?”

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:04.370
This is the first reaction.

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:08.080
Then you can even go further with it, anger
can come in, “Why did they bring such a

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:09.500
nice carpet?

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:15.180
What was the need to put it here?”

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:21.230
It goes on like that, one after another.

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:28.740
Now in My conditioning if I see these things,
I would say that “This color is not suited

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:38.590
for Krishna Puja, they should have had another
color for this Krishna Puja.”

00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:44.450
So this kind goes on from one to another,
to another.

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:50.530
But that means this conditioning is built
up within us.

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:58.800
All our problems of our conditioning are really
horrible.

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:02.340
For example, racialism.

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:04.320
We have racialism.

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:18.610
In America it’s very much more, you can
feel it though they don’t say; but if you

00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:26.070
go, say, from Italy you feel it, if you go
from India also you can feel it.

00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:31.390
Now why this racialism is there?

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:34.080
What is the reason?

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:50.160
Why do we react to this kind of horrible hatred
for another community or another color which

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:55.540
is only skin-deep?

00:17:55.540 --> 00:18:03.800
Now with rationality you might be able to
explain, “O God, these people, they are

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:13.950
absolutely useless,” or “They have come
to our country and are just troubling us.”

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:17.080
All these conditionings are there.

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:24.780
But if you see when they talk of immigrants,
the Americans must know they are immigrants,

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:26.260
all of them.

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:30.770
America never was their country.

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:37.010
And they threw away all the other Red Indians,
took away their land and very nicely they

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:39.550
are governors of America.

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:52.230
But the reaction is, “Those who are not
white complexion, they are all to be condemned,

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:53.420
tortured.”

00:18:53.420 --> 00:19:03.190
Now if they are by nature violent, then also
this conditioning of violence comes in.

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:07.320
Then they start killing each other.

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:17.390
They have killed ruthlessly so many people,
thinking that they have a right to go into

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:26.840
any country and kill everyone and take the
land that is not their own.

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:31.280
Actually, land doesn’t belong to anybody
as such.

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:39.100
But nobody has a right to go to some land
and try to occupy it, and throw away the people

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:42.150
who do not belong to that country.

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:55.260
Yesterday was the Independence Day of India,
and I have seen the flag going up, our national

00:19:55.260 --> 00:20:06.240
flag, and the British flag going down.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:17.000
All that has happened after so much of struggle,
so much of sufferings of the people, because

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:25.070
they came to India, landed nicely there and
became the masters.

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:34.260
So this is also a kind of a conditioning that
comes in a collective way, that you go into

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:41.720
anybody’s country, throw away the people
from there or sort of occupy that place, and

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:42.960
become the masters.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:50.990
It’s like going into somebody’s house
that belongs to somebody, and throw away the

00:20:50.990 --> 00:21:01.250
people who are inside and nicely settle there
as the owners and the masters, because they

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:06.160
have better intelligence, perhaps the cunning
more in them.

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:18.130
With that cunning, if the white people think
they can rule the black people, is not where

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:51.929
you can develop a witness state.

00:21:51.929 --> 00:22:00.690
So this kind of conditioning is like a plague
and moves from one country to another country,

00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:07.070
where some people think they are superior
and make people look inferior.

00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:13.170
And the people also are there who accept this
kind of a situation, accept this kind of a

00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:21.229
position, where they are supposed to be equal.

00:22:21.229 --> 00:22:28.440
I would say take the example of America, because
this has been celebrated by Americans and

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:35.039
because Krishna is the Ruler, Krishna is the
Ruler of America.

00:22:35.039 --> 00:22:42.670
He Himself was a dark person, Himself was
on the black side.

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:54.349
And in the same country where He rules, the
another great thing is that they don’t realize

00:22:54.349 --> 00:23:04.729
that if all the black or the Asians get out
of that country now, I don’t know what will

00:23:04.729 --> 00:23:05.959
happen to them.

00:23:05.959 --> 00:23:10.630
All their sports are managed by the blacks.

00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:19.920
If you want to see any American sport, ninety-nine
per cent are black people.

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:28.029
Then if you want to also see the music, because
these black people, though they have black

00:23:28.029 --> 00:23:38.129
color - which is all right: as you have white,
they have black color - but they have a voice

00:23:38.129 --> 00:23:41.740
which the white people don’t have.

00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:47.800
They can sing so well that no white people
can compete with them.

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:54.319
It’s a full justice done to the color.

00:23:54.319 --> 00:24:04.560
Now if you take out the Asians, all doctors,
all nurses, all architects, all accountants,

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:08.819
all of them will disappear.

00:24:08.819 --> 00:24:12.229
Now what will remain?

00:24:12.229 --> 00:24:23.019
You have to understand that it is color which
is nothing to do, nothing to do with your

00:24:23.019 --> 00:24:29.110
intelligence, with your value system, with
your Spirit.

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:35.390
We are here to achieve our spirituality.

00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:47.779
The Spirit doesn’t understand color because
it is so superficial, and it is so very cruel

00:24:47.779 --> 00:24:54.029
to condemn someone for the color.

00:24:54.029 --> 00:24:57.469
Same now is happening as the reaction.

00:24:57.469 --> 00:25:02.300
Every action has a reaction.

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:08.769
So what happens is that you find the blacks
are reacting.

00:25:08.769 --> 00:25:14.699
They are reacting, and their reaction can
be very dangerous.

00:25:14.699 --> 00:25:28.029
Every day I read their reactions are coming
up so badly; not in America but all over,

00:25:28.029 --> 00:25:32.709
they are now thinking they must rise and oppose
this domination.

00:25:32.709 --> 00:25:42.719
But in their own country where they have people
of different colors, little variation I think,

00:25:42.719 --> 00:25:51.620
they are all black people but little variation
maybe, so they form groups and they start

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:55.539
cutting each other’s throats.

00:25:55.539 --> 00:26:00.890
I’ve seen on the television how ruthlessly
they kill.

00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:09.019
I don’t know what is the difference of color
is, but somehow they have formed groups and

00:26:09.019 --> 00:26:13.649
this group will go and kill that, and that
group will come and kill.

00:26:13.649 --> 00:26:18.729
It’s not like Kaurava and Pandava.

00:26:18.729 --> 00:26:25.219
It’s not two types of people absolutely
opposite, it’s not that the negative and

00:26:25.219 --> 00:26:27.699
the positive is there, it’s not.

00:26:27.699 --> 00:26:35.389
They are all negative, whether they are white
or black, and they start quarreling and fighting

00:26:35.389 --> 00:26:38.519
with each other.

00:26:38.519 --> 00:26:40.990
Now this violence is growing so much.

00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:48.490
I think violence is the only weapon they use
now to express themselves.

00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:58.959
You see here something happens, so somewhere
there you find they explode bombs and kill

00:26:58.959 --> 00:27:00.610
so many innocent people.

00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:06.339
It’s very, very sinful to do like that.

00:27:06.339 --> 00:27:13.390
Even the slightest violence is sinful, and
this kind of a violence, in the eyes of Shri

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:23.560
Krishna, are absolutely to be punished very
well.

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:26.979
Now this comes through ego.

00:27:26.979 --> 00:27:34.710
You think because you belong to one clan,
another clan you can kill, or something like

00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:35.710
that.

00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:43.779
A funny idea into human mind comes in, and
you decide that you have a right to kill another

00:27:43.779 --> 00:27:44.789
person.

00:27:44.789 --> 00:27:52.229
Or one may say this comes from hatred, but
hatred is an outcome of ego.

00:27:52.229 --> 00:28:03.029
When the ego starts acting, it collects all
these things like hatred, also possessiveness,

00:28:03.029 --> 00:28:14.389
anger, violence, all these starts coming out
of the ego, which actually blinds the person.

00:28:14.389 --> 00:28:20.889
You become blind to the fact that there is
no need to have violence, no need to hate

00:28:20.889 --> 00:28:28.860
someone, no need to kill anyone because of
this ego that is there.

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:34.550
Now one may say, “Mother, how does this
ego build up in a people?”

00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:41.890
Of course, mostly it is due to reactions,
also it is due to the conditioning.

00:28:41.890 --> 00:28:49.740
If the child is told from the childhood that
“You should hate these people, they are

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:51.129
to be hated.

00:28:51.129 --> 00:28:58.259
They are wrong people, they are bad people,”
they just start doing that.

00:28:58.259 --> 00:29:07.159
When they grow up they start showing that
hatred is now like a cactus growing very big,

00:29:07.159 --> 00:29:09.789
and is killing others.

00:29:09.789 --> 00:29:17.129
There’s no justification for this kind of
a behavior by human beings.

00:29:17.129 --> 00:29:25.979
If they are human beings they have to have
human qualities, and that is what is possible

00:29:25.979 --> 00:29:34.899
only if you learn how to just witness and
not to react.

00:29:34.899 --> 00:29:40.529
For example you see two cocks are fighting.

00:29:40.529 --> 00:29:43.199
You enjoy that.

00:29:43.199 --> 00:29:48.159
Two cocks are fighting, people are enjoying.

00:29:48.159 --> 00:29:54.409
One cock dies, they are very happy, as if
the one which died had killed his parents

00:29:54.409 --> 00:29:56.320
or did something like that.

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.240
Very surprising!

00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:02.990
Now in Spain even now there are these bull-fights
going on.

00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:10.170
Every year six bull-fights, every year, and
the hall contains more than ten times more

00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:15.620
than we have here, and is always full.

00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:20.180
And now the women have taken to fight the
bulls.

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:25.730
Now if the bull is not killed, they allow
the bulls to go on the street and kill people.

00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:40.009
This kind of a violent enjoyment is still
lingering into the minds of the people.

00:30:40.009 --> 00:30:50.850
It is so sad to see people who are now talking
of humanity, talking of peace, talking of

00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:57.619
joy, are still enjoying these violent acts.

00:30:57.619 --> 00:31:03.300
Either they are doing or they want to watch.

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:10.450
So then you go to these films and things that
have been created of a horrible violence,

00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:17.090
and people enjoy it, enjoy such films, and
such films are again created.

00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:25.000
Now if you really become a witness state,
if you are in a witness state, then what will

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.000
happen?

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:33.780
If you watch any such things that are happening,
it will subside.

00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:44.280
If you are in a witness state and if that
level, then no accident will take place in

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:46.280
your sight.

00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:55.190
Even if there is an accident, then you can
save the person, you can help the person very

00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:56.190
actively.

00:31:56.190 --> 00:32:02.910
That’s in a very small scale, but even in
a very large scale you can do it, something

00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:03.910
wonderful.

00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:11.009
I remember I was not very old at that time,
but we were living in a house very close to

00:32:11.009 --> 00:32:15.700
the Secretariat, where they had a strike.

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:22.200
And they were asking for a separate Maharashtra
or something.

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:29.630
So the police was standing there and by the
order of the Chief Minister they were shooting

00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:36.690
at everyone who was coming, anyone who passed
through that road they were shooting, they

00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:39.489
were enjoying their shooting game, all of
them.

00:32:39.489 --> 00:32:43.160
I saw all this and I just couldn’t bear
it.

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:47.390
I just went down, went down and asked the
police to stop it.

00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:51.460
They stopped, you’d be amazed, they stopped.

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:57.420
Then I carried those people who were wounded
up in My house, took out their bullets and

00:32:57.420 --> 00:33:00.890
all that, called the ambulance and saved them.

00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:07.430
But for that one thing was there: I was in
a state of witnessing, so you become fearless.

00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:16.190
There is no fear at all, once you learn how
to have the state of witnessing.

00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:24.330
Because when you are not witnessing you get
disturbed, you get upset, you get excited,

00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:27.290
you may join also these wrong type of people.

00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:35.190
But if you are in a state of witnessing, that
itself is a power.

00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:44.550
And that witnessing state helps you to win
over so many difficulties of other people.

00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:51.950
There’s this Chinese story about a saint.

00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:59.560
So one king brought his cock to him and said,
“You train my cock in such a way that he

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:00.560
should win.”

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:01.770
He said, “All right.”

00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:13.420
So he kept the cock of the king for one month
and when the show started, different cocks

00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:19.219
came from different places and they all started
fighting.

00:34:19.219 --> 00:34:25.620
This cock just stood up and was watching,
just watching.

00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:31.379
And other cocks got such a fright, they couldn’t
understand how this fellow is not disturbed,

00:34:31.379 --> 00:34:34.739
he’s just watching, he’s standing, he’s
doing nothing.

00:34:34.739 --> 00:34:41.400
So all they disappeared from the arena and
he was declared as the successful one.

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:45.830
So this is the best way to bring non-violence.

00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:55.719
In violent places you go and stand steadily
there, facing all the things that are happening,

00:34:55.719 --> 00:35:09.589
and that witness state acts, acts and stops
that kind of a violence that is going on.

00:35:09.589 --> 00:35:19.469
But witness state is not a mental state, it
is a state of a spiritual ascent where you

00:35:19.469 --> 00:35:23.209
become a witness.

00:35:23.209 --> 00:35:31.749
Best way to practice witness state is not
to criticize anyone, not to criticize.

00:35:31.749 --> 00:35:36.650
I’ve seen people who are all the time criticizing
others.

00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:40.540
They cannot criticize themselves, so they
start criticizing other.

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:45.700
So much so that they don’t even see what’s
wrong with them.

00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:51.650
They don’t even see what wrong they have
done to others, because they think they have

00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:57.680
a right to criticize others, and they enjoy
this criticism very well.

00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:01.350
Actually there’s nothing to be criticized.

00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:04.459
You just watch and see for yourself.

00:36:04.459 --> 00:36:06.940
That’s all is your right.

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:11.140
You have no right to criticize anyone or anything.

00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:18.070
But some people think if you do not criticize,
then it will go on like this and it will never

00:36:18.070 --> 00:36:19.070
stop.

00:36:19.070 --> 00:36:20.070
It’s not that!

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:23.849
Once you watch the thing yourself, only just
watch.

00:36:23.849 --> 00:36:32.190
Your attention itself is enlightened now,
with that enlightened attention you can just

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:37.300
watch and stop the nonsense that is there.

00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:43.040
But we are always conscious that we are something
great, and we have to do this and we have

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:45.969
to do that.

00:36:45.969 --> 00:36:55.580
Under these circumstances what happens is
that you become another problem.

00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:58.209
Because what can you do?

00:36:58.209 --> 00:37:00.849
You can’t do anything.

00:37:00.849 --> 00:37:05.140
But what you can do is to watch.

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:15.160
By watching and by just seeing things as they
are, you really develop a very different state

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:17.369
of being.

00:37:17.369 --> 00:37:29.079
Firstly all such people who are just witnessing,
what happens to them is very interesting,

00:37:29.079 --> 00:37:35.440
that their memory loss is much less, because
whatever they see becomes like a picture to

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:36.440
them.

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:42.180
Like you can say, they can tell you even the
color, the folding, everything.

00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:49.000
Whatever they see is so much in their mind
like a photo, and they can tell you exactly

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:56.770
what they have seen, and your memory is not
lost.

00:37:56.770 --> 00:38:04.100
While if you react onto everything, your memory
becomes horrible.

00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:09.219
And people are so much habituated with reacting.

00:38:09.219 --> 00:38:17.770
Like I know of one gentleman, he had a habit
of reacting, and I was going with him in the

00:38:17.770 --> 00:38:18.770
car.

00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:31.890
So he was reading every advertisement, every
name of every shop, every person, everything.

00:38:31.890 --> 00:38:34.190
He was just telling, “Who is that?

00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:35.300
What is that?”

00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:36.300
- this, that.

00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:42.079
I was wondering, “Look at this gentleman,
he’s talking so much, what will happen to

00:38:42.079 --> 00:38:43.079
him?”

00:38:43.079 --> 00:38:50.540
But ultimately I’ve found that all such
people who are all the time reacting become,

00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:56.970
actually they have, I think, senile decay
or maybe they become forgetful, very forgetful.

00:38:56.970 --> 00:39:02.829
But this is not the only loss we have.

00:39:02.829 --> 00:39:10.329
With this kind of people, when they are formed
into a collective they can be very dangerous

00:39:10.329 --> 00:39:16.079
people, because with that kind of a nature
they have to do something.

00:39:16.079 --> 00:39:22.430
They must do something because, after all,
they are combined together for a purpose or,

00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:27.099
we can say, for some reactions which all of
them have built up.

00:39:27.099 --> 00:39:32.859
In small things, in big things, you’ll find
people do like that.

00:39:32.859 --> 00:39:41.339
And some people who are very much, very much
developed in this kind of behavior can collect

00:39:41.339 --> 00:39:45.999
lots of people, and do any amount of harm
to others.

00:39:45.999 --> 00:39:49.249
I would look at the picture of Hitler.

00:39:49.249 --> 00:39:54.410
For nine years this fellow was watching what
wrongs Jews are doing.

00:39:54.410 --> 00:40:04.209
He wouldn’t watch what Germans are doing,
what wrong they are doing to the society.

00:40:04.209 --> 00:40:10.830
And that time the society also was very bad,
because they were having all kinds of licentiousness.

00:40:10.830 --> 00:40:17.879
Now he was noting down, “These Jews are
like this, they do this, they take money,

00:40:17.879 --> 00:40:22.660
they - lending money,” all kinds of things
he got into his head.

00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:29.410
As a result of that he built up a reaction
into him that “We must somehow or another

00:40:29.410 --> 00:40:34.770
see that these people go away from Germany.”

00:40:34.770 --> 00:40:40.780
But then he thought, “Even if they go away
from Germany, they’ll prosper again.

00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:42.239
So why not kill them?”

00:40:42.239 --> 00:40:50.400
I mean, to such an extent that even, you know,
you cannot see such films, you cannot see

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:53.869
anything of that nature that Hitler did.

00:40:53.869 --> 00:41:01.869
But he did it, and people who followed him
also did it without feeling any hitch, as

00:41:01.869 --> 00:41:09.310
if it was a matter of great pleasure or a
joy, or maybe it’s a duty.

00:41:09.310 --> 00:41:15.479
How could they get duty bound to such a horrible
thing like killing thousands and thousands

00:41:15.479 --> 00:41:18.670
of Jews?

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:22.920
What Jews had done to them, they could have
corrected it.

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:26.180
But why did they indulge into such violence?

00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:30.190
And they wanted to finish all the Jews of
the world.

00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:38.459
It can be very, very dangerous, because once
you start losing your witness state you can

00:41:38.459 --> 00:41:43.369
fall into negative collectivity.

00:41:43.369 --> 00:41:50.469
And thus this negative collectivity acts,
acts in such a bad manner that all the conflicts

00:41:50.469 --> 00:41:57.739
of the world, all the problems of the world
perhaps are related with this.

00:41:57.739 --> 00:42:08.329
So as Sahaja Yogis, what should we do?

00:42:08.329 --> 00:42:19.209
We should not react, we should not react.

00:42:19.209 --> 00:42:28.599
If you see something wrong, all right, you
meditate on that point, you meditate.

00:42:28.599 --> 00:42:37.469
If you find anything wrong happening, all
right, meditate on that.

00:42:37.469 --> 00:42:42.599
If somebody is unkind to you, at that moment
do not react.

00:42:42.599 --> 00:42:51.869
Afterwards when that person is quietened,
you tell him or tell her, because at that

00:42:51.869 --> 00:42:57.590
time when he’s so volatile or she’s volatile
if you tell, nothing will happen.

00:42:57.590 --> 00:43:04.989
Gradually, I don’t say always you can win
over such people, but gradually you may be

00:43:04.989 --> 00:43:13.800
able to make them understand that it’s wrong,
it’s wrong to do things which they have

00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:15.520
been doing.

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:27.579
In a way, you see, the reaction to anything
which is stupid also can be very self-destroying.

00:43:27.579 --> 00:43:32.390
Like some people have built-in reactions,
like you have seen this Mr. Clinton behaving.

00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:39.550
I mean, you can’t understand a man of his
stature, of his level should have such reactions,

00:43:39.550 --> 00:43:46.550
but must be from his childhood or I don’t
know how he built it up.

00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:50.619
Now he is in trouble, and very shameful.

00:43:50.619 --> 00:44:02.540
This also is, I think perhaps comes from a
very great indulgence into reactions.

00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:09.859
Why should you react to a woman, I can’t
understand, or to a man?

00:44:09.859 --> 00:44:16.790
And this is one of the biggest problems of
today’s culture, specially in all the developed

00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:23.239
countries, that all the time men are looking
at women, women are looking at men.

00:44:23.239 --> 00:44:25.020
For what?

00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:29.930
Perhaps they look at women because they want
to see how many women are looking at them.

00:44:29.930 --> 00:44:37.820
Or they look at men perhaps may be that how
many men are looking at them.

00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:40.249
Why, why is this happening?

00:44:40.249 --> 00:44:46.660
Because they have some inferiority complex
in them, or that they want to attract the

00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:47.800
attention of everyone.

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:53.369
I mean, horrible things are done these days
to attract the attention of others, to get

00:44:53.369 --> 00:44:54.900
the sympathy of others.

00:44:54.900 --> 00:45:00.290
I mean, if you see the level of your awareness
where it goes, you’ll be amazed.

00:45:00.290 --> 00:45:07.089
Like they say one lady killed her eight children
just to get sympathy from others.

00:45:07.089 --> 00:45:13.849
But think of such horrible things people are
doing.

00:45:13.849 --> 00:45:27.341
Now if you want others to have reaction you
do this, that they want others to see you

00:45:27.341 --> 00:45:37.199
or to react to you, I don’t know, to give
you importance, you can say.

00:45:37.199 --> 00:45:39.190
But what is the use of such an empty importance?

00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:50.570
But people are seeking, and is a very common
disease of modern life: all the time how you

00:45:50.570 --> 00:45:56.420
should look, how you should appear, how you
should walk.

00:45:56.420 --> 00:46:01.720
Everything is so stupid and wastage of energy.

00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:13.569
God has created human beings very, very different,
none of them are copies, none of them.

00:46:13.569 --> 00:46:22.579
Even in the nature you find the leaves of
trees, they are so unique, you cannot match

00:46:22.579 --> 00:46:26.080
them with another leaf.

00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:29.950
So that’s how human beings are created,
differently.

00:46:29.950 --> 00:46:33.830
They are made like that.

00:46:33.830 --> 00:46:37.420
One has to accept.

00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:39.459
Whatever you are, it’s all right.

00:46:39.459 --> 00:46:43.650
Why do you want to look like another person?

00:46:43.650 --> 00:46:50.490
This kind of reaction is extremely stupid,
I think, that we are spoiling our energy and

00:46:50.490 --> 00:46:56.849
life for something absolutely worthless.

00:46:56.849 --> 00:47:00.729
Now you being Sahaja Yogis, your worth is
great.

00:47:00.729 --> 00:47:12.119
You have come here to emancipate human beings
from these silly ideas and foolish ways, the

00:47:12.119 --> 00:47:15.840
way people are behaving.

00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:22.180
I don’t know whom to blame, but suddenly
our attention has become very diversified,

00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:26.310
our reactions have become very, very funny.

00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:34.440
One doesn’t know why people react like that,
and then why do we worry about what people

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:35.440
react?

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:43.960
All these things are not only on individual
level, but also on a collective level.

00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:50.090
As a result, you see, new kinds of value system
has been created.

00:47:50.090 --> 00:48:00.520
Now for a mother, say for example, she’ll
boast of how many men are running after her.

00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:05.230
Or she would think she is a great actress
- I don’t know what they think of themselves.

00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:08.629
And the way they talk about themselves is
something surprising.

00:48:08.629 --> 00:48:16.630
If she’s a mother, she has to be a good
mother and she has to look like a mother.

00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:30.720
But they are so much engrossed or they are
so much standing on the basis that they have

00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:41.870
to be extremely attractive, they have to be
the queens or I don’t know what, what a

00:48:41.870 --> 00:48:43.570
position they want to have.

00:48:43.570 --> 00:48:45.790
Same with the men.

00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:55.890
You see, if you have something within you,
if there is any quality within you, is there

00:48:55.890 --> 00:49:02.390
anything that can qualify you as a great man,
it will be showing.

00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:10.660
You don’t have to advertise, you don’t
have to pamper it, nothing, it will be showing.

00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:20.110
So that indifference if you have towards the
public opinion, I think you can achieve a

00:49:20.110 --> 00:49:21.300
lot.

00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:23.630
Most of the frustrations will disappear.

00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:31.870
In Sahaja Yoga also I have seen people want
to show off a lot.

00:49:31.870 --> 00:49:34.230
I know who does that.

00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:42.860
But they should know, once you do not react
to outside you start reacting to inside, and

00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:49.080
introspection will start properly.

00:49:49.080 --> 00:50:04.090
When you see yourself you’ll be amazed how
admiring you are, how happy you are.

00:50:04.090 --> 00:50:12.840
Now if you go beyond that a little more, then
you don’t think of all these things.

00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:23.900
You just become thoughtless and you just stand
up as a person who is respected, whose company

00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:32.710
is wanted, who is loved and who is cared for.

00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:38.230
So one should not worry as to what people
react, what they say about you, what they

00:50:38.230 --> 00:50:40.730
think about you.

00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:45.420
You should just introspect and see for yourself.

00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:58.950
After some time you don’t need even introspection.

00:50:58.950 --> 00:51:08.550
It is a kind of a state I am talking about,
where Shri Krishna told Arjuna that “I will

00:51:08.550 --> 00:51:13.020
not fight.

00:51:13.020 --> 00:51:23.540
So in between Me and the army, My army, you
have to select.”

00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:27.240
So Kauravas said, “No, we’ll take Your
army, Your army.

00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:34.210
You give us Your army and we’ll strengthen
our army.”

00:51:34.210 --> 00:51:41.730
But Arjuna said, “I don’t want army, I
want You.

00:51:41.730 --> 00:51:47.200
You don’t want to fight, it’s all right.”

00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:56.960
Because though He will be there in a witness
state only, He won’t be fighting but His

00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:59.840
power will act.

00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:09.560
He doesn’t have to fight, He doesn’t have
to do anything, but His own power which is

00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:18.770
outwardly is silent but will act, and that
is how we will win the war.

00:52:18.770 --> 00:52:21.780
So this power of witnessing you all should
develop.

00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:39.030
Try to develop it that when you are reacting,
stop reaction, stop reaction about everything.

00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:45.020
You will be amazed, you will find yourself
a very, very powerful person in the sense

00:52:45.020 --> 00:52:53.940
you’ll have no ambitions, you’ll have
no desires, you’ll have no special fondness

00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:56.400
or anything.

00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:59.980
But just you are witnessing the drama.

00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:07.711
It’s very interesting to witness also, because
then you understand the humor behind everything,

00:53:07.711 --> 00:53:13.040
you understand the stupidity behind everything.

00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:25.380
You understand also how people have been so
violent, and you just laugh at it; you don’t

00:53:25.380 --> 00:53:31.270
get upset, excited, nothing, just laugh at
it.

00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:38.420
After some time you’ll be amazed, your witness
state will increase, and when in the collective

00:53:38.420 --> 00:53:49.641
all of you have that witness state, you can
do wonders without doing anything, without

00:53:49.641 --> 00:53:56.980
saying anything, without acting - only your
presence itself can work it out.

00:53:56.980 --> 00:54:02.830
I don’t say that it will have effect on
everyone, no, can’t say; but most of the

00:54:02.830 --> 00:54:06.180
people.

00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:17.340
Any person who is in that state, he is the
one who brings peace, he brings joy.

00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:27.180
I’ll tell you a story of a Sahaja Yogi who
was going to another island - he was living

00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:35.940
in an island - for Sahaja Yoga work, and he
found the whole sky was covered with very

00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:38.710
black clouds, thundering clouds.

00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:46.870
So he just looked at them like this and he
said, “Wait till I come back.

00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:51.360
I am going to do Mother’s work.”

00:54:51.360 --> 00:55:02.180
He went to another island, he did the program,
everything happened and when he came back

00:55:02.180 --> 00:55:11.880
he wanted to sleep, and suddenly it started
raining and thundering.

00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:14.580
Even the nature understands.

00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:21.340
Nature understands that you are in that great
state of witnessing.

00:55:21.340 --> 00:55:28.580
But if you are very ambitious - even in Sahaja
Yoga I have known people who are very ambitious,

00:55:28.580 --> 00:55:32.690
they want to become leaders, I don’t know
what else.

00:55:32.690 --> 00:55:34.720
Actually, it’s all a myth.

00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:42.100
All mythical things they want to get to, and
worry their heads about mythical things.

00:55:42.100 --> 00:55:48.990
Once you learn how to witness you will know
the myth, you will know the absurdity, you

00:55:48.990 --> 00:55:51.260
will know the maya.

00:55:51.260 --> 00:56:03.560
So to overcome the problems of personality
the best thing is to witness, practice witnessing

00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:13.680
everything: before talking, practice witnessing,
before giving any comments, just start witnessing.

00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:17.760
It’s a very, very satisfying attitude.

00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:32.850
In Shri Krishna’s life the greatest power
He was, a witnessing personality.

00:56:32.850 --> 00:56:44.030
Without doing anything, without taking a sword
in His hands, without talking about fighting,

00:56:44.030 --> 00:56:54.770
He is the One who has helped Pandavas to win
the war.

00:56:54.770 --> 00:57:04.520
Not only, but through His “Gita” He has
tried to tell us what we have to do to win

00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:07.600
the war over evil.

00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:15.870
Whole “Gita” is the witness state He’s
described about.

00:57:15.870 --> 00:57:22.230
If you read it “Gita” now from this angle,
you’ll be amazed to find that everywhere

00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:28.600
He is like a witness describing everything,
whatever He sees.

00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:40.070
And He will tell you how, how this witness
state has helped Him to understand also human

00:57:40.070 --> 00:57:41.070
beings.

00:57:41.070 --> 00:57:50.470
He is a man who was, we should say, was not
such a big businessman; because first He told

00:57:50.470 --> 00:57:53.520
you that how to become sthita pragnya.

00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:59.850
“Sthita pragnya” is the one who is in
the witness state.

00:57:59.850 --> 00:58:07.440
If you see all these verses on sthita pragnya,
is nothing but a person who is in a witness

00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:14.880
state: how he lives, how he is happy, how
he looks at things.

00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:17.810
It’s interesting, very interesting.

00:58:17.810 --> 00:58:24.020
First He describes that, not like the sharp
people who will describe first the bad things,

00:58:24.020 --> 00:58:26.560
but He starts with the best.

00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:37.310
Then He goes down to other things and tell
you that whatever are the three aspects.

00:58:37.310 --> 00:58:43.960
The first He talks about karma, and many people
get stuck at that point, that “Whatever

00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:47.950
karmas we are doing, we’ll get the punyas
out of it.”

00:58:47.950 --> 00:58:51.140
But He is not.

00:58:51.140 --> 00:58:54.340
He didn’t say that.

00:58:54.340 --> 00:58:58.360
If you know Him, then you will know He never
meant that.

00:58:58.360 --> 00:59:09.240
What He says, that “Whatever karmas you
have to do, you can do it, but leave the results

00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:12.090
to the Divine Power.”

00:59:12.090 --> 00:59:19.240
Results are from the Divine Power.

00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:27.970
Now may be that some people think that they
have got money because they have done good

00:59:27.970 --> 00:59:35.360
karmas, and start doing all kinds of bad karmas
with that money.

00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:36.690
He didn’t say that.

00:59:36.690 --> 00:59:41.380
He said, “Leave the results to the Divine
Power.”

00:59:41.380 --> 00:59:47.440
Because Divine Power knows best what is for
you.

00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:53.530
And so if you think you have done something
good, you have served somewhere to the poor,

00:59:53.530 --> 01:00:03.010
you have done something really good for the
women or anything; the result of that, you

01:00:03.010 --> 01:00:14.180
leave it at the feet of the Divine Power - means
that you don’t build up an ego for whatever

01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:16.500
you have done.

01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:22.690
Though very well He has written this, but
to understand Him one should have again the

01:00:22.690 --> 01:00:28.950
witness state to see what He has written about
karma.

01:00:28.950 --> 01:00:31.160
Then He has written about gnyana.

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:35.530
Gnyana means “where you know.”

01:00:35.530 --> 01:00:42.110
But that doesn’t mean you go on reading
books, never.

01:00:42.110 --> 01:00:50.600
Gnyana means to know what you are.

01:00:50.600 --> 01:01:04.090
That means you have to be a Sahaja Yogi, by
which you know so many things through vibrations.

01:01:04.090 --> 01:01:10.050
Gnyana doesn’t mean reading books.

01:01:10.050 --> 01:01:15.370
By reading books you become more ignorant.

01:01:15.370 --> 01:01:24.010
So gnyana means that you must know yourself.

01:01:24.010 --> 01:01:28.170
If you do not know yourself, you do not know
anything.

01:01:28.170 --> 01:01:34.130
So it comes to, that you must get your Self
Realization.

01:01:34.130 --> 01:01:35.580
You must know yourself.

01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:37.970
It’s the second thing He has said.

01:01:37.970 --> 01:01:41.200
Lastly, He talks about bhakti.

01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:46.800
Bhakti is devotion.

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:50.980
That too is another trick of Shri Krishna,
the way He describes bhakti.

01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:57.880
Now you find people on the street, “Hare
Rama, Hare Krishna” singing.

01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:03.700
In one word He is concluded: He says, “You
must do ananya bhakti.”

01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:08.000
Ananya means “when there is not the other.”

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:15.280
That means when you have submerged yourself
into the Divine, you are one with the Divine,

01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:20.510
then you should do bhakti, otherwise I do
not accept.

01:02:20.510 --> 01:02:34.510
He says that “If you give Me some leaves
or some fruits or some flowers, I will accept,

01:02:34.510 --> 01:02:44.480
I will accept,” but for Him the real bhakti
is only possible when you become one with

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:51.680
the Divine; otherwise it’s just a show.

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:56.810
So the third bhakti part also comes after
Self Realization.

01:02:56.810 --> 01:03:09.370
Now in the bhakti you see there is no “what
is the value is and how much you’ve paid

01:03:09.370 --> 01:03:12.830
for it, and how you bought it”- it’s not
important.

01:03:12.830 --> 01:03:22.880
For that, a great example is of Shri Rama
when He went in the jungles.

01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:35.000
There was a old lady from the schedules caste,
means she was one of the Bhilini as they call

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:39.050
it, these people live in the jungles.

01:03:39.050 --> 01:03:46.690
So she brought some berries and offered it
to Shri Ram.

01:03:46.690 --> 01:03:55.520
And she said that “I have tasted all of
them and they are not sour, all of them I

01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:57.100
have tasted.”

01:03:57.100 --> 01:04:05.680
Now after tasting something in India, people
call it, is become not to be eaten.

01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:10.640
I mean, we cannot taste something and give
it to somebody else, it’s not done according

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:12.090
to Indian culture.

01:04:12.090 --> 01:04:14.500
But Shri Rama took it.

01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:18.350
He took it and said, “What beautiful fruits!

01:04:18.350 --> 01:04:23.950
I’ve never eaten such fruits!”

01:04:23.950 --> 01:04:25.590
So Lakshmana got very angry.

01:04:25.590 --> 01:04:31.020
He said, “You stupid woman, you have eaten
these fruits and that’s what you are giving

01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:32.210
to Shri Ram.

01:04:32.210 --> 01:04:35.930
Why did you do that?”

01:04:35.930 --> 01:04:42.450
So Sita was watching, so She asked Him, “Why
don’t You give Me some of these fruits?”

01:04:42.450 --> 01:04:43.800
He gave.

01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:48.260
She said, “My God, what nice fruits these
are!

01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:51.300
I have never eaten such good fruits.”

01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:56.240
So then Lakshmana also, His temper came down
and He said, “Can You not give Me some?”

01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:57.350
She said, “Why?

01:04:57.350 --> 01:05:00.670
You were so angry, why should I give You?”

01:05:00.670 --> 01:05:03.030
Ultimately She gives Him that fruit.

01:05:03.030 --> 01:05:04.580
So what did He see in those fruits?

01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:17.750
It was the love, the love of this old lady
living in the forest, her love which was important.

01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:24.180
So when you want to give something also it
is your love which is important, not how much

01:05:24.180 --> 01:05:27.170
you paid, what value you have spent, nothing.

01:05:27.170 --> 01:05:34.550
It’s the love with which you do it, and
that love should be evident.

01:05:34.550 --> 01:05:43.620
If such things can happen, even with Shri
Krishna the same thing happened.

01:05:43.620 --> 01:05:53.330
He went to - they called it Hastinapur in
those days, where these Kauravas were ruling.

01:05:53.330 --> 01:05:57.961
And the king was Duryodhana, and he asked
Him, “You come and stay with us and have

01:05:57.961 --> 01:05:58.961
food.”

01:05:58.961 --> 01:06:01.890
He said, “No, no, I won’t be able to come.”

01:06:01.890 --> 01:06:09.300
He goes to another person, Vidhura, who was
the son of a maidservant; Vidhura, because

01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:12.890
Vidhura was a realized soul.

01:06:12.890 --> 01:06:20.070
He was a realized soul, so He went and ate
in his house, where he had cooked very simple

01:06:20.070 --> 01:06:21.070
food.

01:06:21.070 --> 01:06:27.130
Because he was a realized soul, to Him he
was the best to have food with.

01:06:27.130 --> 01:06:35.400
So your value system should be based on such
things like love.

01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:40.740
Where you can get love, you should be attached
to that person.

01:06:40.740 --> 01:06:47.140
Where you get a realized soul, you should
be attached to them and not to worldly people

01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:50.860
who think no end of themselves, and think
that they are great.

01:06:50.860 --> 01:07:00.100
They may be, but to you as Sahaja Yogis it’s
the love of people which should be respected,

01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:04.710
should be understood and to be felt.

01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:09.890
But if you have no witness state, then you
will see how much money this man has got,

01:07:09.890 --> 01:07:18.540
how many cars he has got, what clothes he’s
wearing, all these considerations will be

01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:19.540
there.

01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:24.710
But in a witness state, you will understand
that you will get vibrations from this person,

01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:29.860
you will understand that person is spiritual.

01:07:30.110 --> 01:07:39.150
And that’s how you will stick to such a
person, you will not go for artificial things,

01:07:39.150 --> 01:07:42.629
but the genuine personalities that are there.

01:07:43.008 --> 01:07:44.559
May God bless you all.

01:07:45.258 --> 01:07:46.258
Thank you.

01:08:10.012 --> 01:08:17.032
Today they have decided to read some of the
names Sahaja Yogis have got with them, and

01:08:17.082 --> 01:08:27.352
they want to distribute, they have distributed
these names to you.

01:08:27.985 --> 01:08:32.485
So somebody will read those names of Shri
Krishna.

01:08:32.502 --> 01:08:38.215
Now just imagine with witness state all these
powers that are described of Shri Krishna,

01:08:38.249 --> 01:08:43.659
how they will act and how they will work through
you.
