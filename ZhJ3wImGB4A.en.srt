1
00:06:58,588 --> 00:07:03,457
Today we are celebrating the birth of Christ,

2
00:07:08,113 --> 00:07:12,504
which was a very big event in the realm of human awareness.

3
00:07:12,705 --> 00:07:18,667
As you know that when He is born in the Agnya chakra

4
00:07:19,074 --> 00:07:22,554
He sucks the ego and superego,

5
00:07:22,807 --> 00:07:29,144
that is the conditioning within us and our ego.

6
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:37,394
Such a great happening has taken place, about 2000 years back.

7
00:07:37,712 --> 00:07:41,549
But today is the time for us to use, utilize

8
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,833
that great Advent on this earth.

9
00:07:47,011 --> 00:07:50,615
To understand Christ first of all we have to know

10
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:55,304
that He was just nothing but Omkara.

11
00:07:56,425 --> 00:08:01,286
He was just made of vibrations

12
00:08:01,792 --> 00:08:04,995
and that is why He was resurrected.

13
00:08:05,207 --> 00:08:10,862
And He was detached because of His very nature.

14
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:18,911
And so we too have to understand

15
00:08:19,112 --> 00:08:24,157
that we have to be detached,

16
00:08:24,358 --> 00:08:27,291
first from our thoughts,

17
00:08:27,492 --> 00:08:30,814
and that as you know is achieved

18
00:08:31,015 --> 00:08:33,511
if you know how to forgive others.

19
00:08:33,712 --> 00:08:38,138
But there is another very subtle attachment people have

20
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:41,131
that those who are born in Christian religion

21
00:08:41,332 --> 00:08:44,407
think that Christ is their own

22
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:46,805
and that He resides in their pocket.

23
00:08:47,006 --> 00:08:49,182
On the contrary it's just the other way round,

24
00:08:49,383 --> 00:08:51,364
that He has nothing to do with them

25
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:53,084
and He is against them.

26
00:08:53,285 --> 00:08:56,578
As Christ has said "You will be calling Me, `Christ, Christ`

27
00:08:56,779 --> 00:08:58,395
and I will not know you".

28
00:08:58,596 --> 00:09:02,569
So it is important that Christians should never think

29
00:09:02,847 --> 00:09:06,373
that, "Christ is our own and that He is ours",

30
00:09:06,574 --> 00:09:09,220
because all your life you have lived like Christians.

31
00:09:09,464 --> 00:09:12,374
Actually you have not; you have not lived like Christians.

32
00:09:12,575 --> 00:09:14,534
So those who have not lived like Christians,

33
00:09:14,735 --> 00:09:16,715
only have taken the name of Christianity

34
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:21,181
are not in the real sense the people who follow Christ.

35
00:09:21,382 --> 00:09:26,245
So now we have to change ourselves and follow Him in our lives.

36
00:09:26,446 --> 00:09:30,019
Unless and until we imbibe Him in our lives

37
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:33,844
we have not understood

38
00:09:34,045 --> 00:09:38,579
the greatness of His advent.

39
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:43,654
Just because we are Christians or so-called Christians,

40
00:09:43,878 --> 00:09:46,965
to believe we have much to do about Him

41
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,936
and to be identified with Him

42
00:09:49,137 --> 00:09:51,086
is absolutely wrong.

43
00:09:51,287 --> 00:09:53,290
And that's what I warned you before

44
00:09:53,491 --> 00:09:58,165
that we have to imbibe all His qualities.

45
00:09:58,785 --> 00:10:02,412
It was a living example of a very great Advent.

46
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,577
that He came on this earth and led such a pure and a holy life.

47
00:10:08,229 --> 00:10:11,303
Try to develop your purity and holiness

48
00:10:11,504 --> 00:10:15,659
and a powerful holiness and a powerful auspiciousness

49
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:19,370
which does not get contaminated, but fights

50
00:10:19,571 --> 00:10:23,290
whatever is anti-God, whatever is anti-Christ.

51
00:10:24,102 --> 00:10:30,342
So today is a day when we are celebrating His birthday again

52
00:10:31,402 --> 00:10:33,846
and on this day let Him be born within us

53
00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:36,533
let Him be born in our character,

54
00:10:36,734 --> 00:10:39,865
in our behavior, in our temperament.

55
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:44,022
He was a detached man, not attached to material things,

56
00:10:44,223 --> 00:10:47,756
nothing of the kind; He lived like a carpenter’s son,

57
00:10:47,957 --> 00:10:51,799
in a very uncomfortable life, absolutely.

58
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,295
And He never bothered about small things of life.

59
00:10:55,496 --> 00:10:57,605
Actually, you know, a carpenter's house

60
00:10:57,806 --> 00:11:01,227
is one of the most dangerous places to live in

61
00:11:01,457 --> 00:11:03,465
because you have all kinds of nails,

62
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:09,311
you have all kinds of funny types of instruments that you use.

63
00:11:09,527 --> 00:11:13,376
Any day you can topple onto anything and can get hurt.

64
00:11:13,577 --> 00:11:16,321
And there is hardly any place where you can sleep.

65
00:11:16,522 --> 00:11:18,599
The whole place is filled with wood

66
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,071
and people mostly sleep on wood.

67
00:11:21,272 --> 00:11:24,256
But just the other way round, we, the so-called Christians

68
00:11:24,439 --> 00:11:27,743
are so particular about our comfort.

69
00:11:27,944 --> 00:11:30,187
And it's very easy for us to condemn others

70
00:11:30,388 --> 00:11:33,705
it's very easy, it's something so absurd. I mean it's so absurd!

71
00:11:33,906 --> 00:11:37,833
You see anything - they'll go, say
to a market place, "Oh it's horrid",

72
00:11:38,034 --> 00:11:42,458
they'll go to some place and say, "That’s bad". What about you?

73
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:46,323
What is within yourself?

74
00:11:46,951 --> 00:11:48,544
Just see within yourself.

75
00:11:48,745 --> 00:11:51,462
And this is the thing we have to develop now,

76
00:11:51,663 --> 00:11:53,966
we have to cleanse ourselves from within.

77
00:11:54,199 --> 00:11:56,873
You have to be uncomfortable with yourself

78
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,649
nothing without.

79
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:02,918
We have to be uncomfortable with what bad things we have within ourselves

80
00:12:03,119 --> 00:12:04,320
and not from without.

81
00:12:04,521 --> 00:12:06,883
Take your attention from outside inward,

82
00:12:07,084 --> 00:12:10,579
as Christ lived a life which was inward.

83
00:12:10,792 --> 00:12:14,571
He was not living outside. He was living inside Himself.

84
00:12:14,816 --> 00:12:18,138
And that is what we have to today understand, on this day,

85
00:12:18,339 --> 00:12:21,241
that our new birth should take us inward.

86
00:12:21,442 --> 00:12:23,612
Our worry should be for our inward comfort

87
00:12:23,813 --> 00:12:25,418
and not for outward comfort.

88
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,809
Like yesterday, if you didn’t like the picture,

89
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:30,378
it's a good sign, that you can’t live with dirt and filth.

90
00:12:30,579 --> 00:12:32,185
But that is still outside.

91
00:12:32,368 --> 00:12:34,483
But what about the inward dirt and filth?

92
00:12:34,684 --> 00:12:37,918
What about the inward thoughts that are contaminating us?

93
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,308
What about the silly ideas that are still on our heads?

94
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:47,034
Take them away, throw them away and be again born

95
00:12:47,217 --> 00:12:48,927
like the lotus starts,

96
00:12:49,128 --> 00:12:50,940
like Christ,

97
00:12:51,214 --> 00:12:55,954
who all His life lived like this, died for us and was resurrected.

98
00:12:56,886 --> 00:12:58,943
So we have such a great example

99
00:12:59,144 --> 00:13:02,509
to be imbibed within ourselves, in our character, in our lives.

100
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:06,372
This is I am saying again and again, because we really get confused.

101
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:11,726
We think if we have a sort of a passport,

102
00:13:13,138 --> 00:13:16,047
 we are all right. No that is not so.

103
00:13:16,248 --> 00:13:20,335
 It's the becoming within yourself of Christ like behavior.

104
00:13:20,536 --> 00:13:24,560
And the greatest of all is forgiving,

105
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:26,614
the forgiveness,

106
00:13:26,815 --> 00:13:30,795
the forgiveness which is so lacking in us, you see.

107
00:13:30,996 --> 00:13:35,221
Unless and until we develop that... This ego has to go away.

108
00:13:35,422 --> 00:13:38,857
If you have to be Christians, you have to be egoless.

109
00:13:39,501 --> 00:13:42,552
And that's what one has to understand

110
00:13:42,753 --> 00:13:47,994
that when we talk of Christ's birth - such a beautiful time -

111
00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:50,783
though he was born in complete discomfort.

112
00:13:50,984 --> 00:13:53,230
He could have born in a king’s place.

113
00:13:53,464 --> 00:13:55,770
He could have born anywhere. But why he did it?

114
00:13:55,971 --> 00:13:58,299
Because He knew that when Christians will come

115
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,529
they will seek the best beds for themselves,

116
00:14:02,171 --> 00:14:04,458
the best houses for themselves,

117
00:14:04,659 --> 00:14:06,892
and little bit here and there they won’t tolerate.

118
00:14:07,093 --> 00:14:09,651
They will be shouting for little things: a carpet is spoiled,

119
00:14:09,852 --> 00:14:12,973
this is spoiled and it's so low minded.

120
00:14:15,608 --> 00:14:21,769
So for you it is important that you must rise higher,

121
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:26,679
higher and see how He was born in a manger,

122
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,773
in a such uncomfortable place

123
00:14:28,944 --> 00:14:31,877
where there were all kinds of cows and cow dung

124
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:33,902
and everything was spread there

125
00:14:34,103 --> 00:14:36,896
and He just didn’t bother.

126
00:14:37,136 --> 00:14:39,885
He just got His birth in a place

127
00:14:40,086 --> 00:14:44,156
which you would not like to even visit or to sit there.

128
00:14:45,044 --> 00:14:48,089
And the mother cleaned the whole thing for Him

129
00:14:48,355 --> 00:14:50,008
and He was born there,

130
00:14:50,209 --> 00:14:55,876
a sparkling star of the heavens, to cleanse everything.

131
00:14:56,136 --> 00:15:01,860
Because if you are clean, you clean others.

132
00:15:04,128 --> 00:15:09,568
So this today, the great day of His advent

133
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:15,086
let us celebrate in this great country of yoga,

134
00:15:15,287 --> 00:15:20,480
specially this bhoomi of Pune, which is the punya-bhoomi,

135
00:15:21,133 --> 00:15:24,792
that the auspiciousness, the holiness,

136
00:15:24,993 --> 00:15:31,980
and the complete detached temperament of Christ

137
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,567
we are going to imbibe within ourselves

138
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:42,082
and we are going to live like real followers of Christ and His life.

139
00:15:42,964 --> 00:15:46,328
Today you are Sahaja Yogis, so you have no caste, no custom,

140
00:15:46,597 --> 00:15:49,145
you have, you have no religion now.

141
00:15:49,394 --> 00:15:53,461
Now you have only one universal religion that is Sahaja Yoga

142
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:58,111
and yet, there Christ is worshipped, everybody worships Christ

143
00:15:58,312 --> 00:16:02,085
because He came not for one person, 2 persons or 10 persons.

144
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:09,496
But those who worship Him, must express His character, His life.

145
00:16:09,697 --> 00:16:13,373
Like materialists, how can they talk
 of Christ I just can’t understand,

146
00:16:13,574 --> 00:16:16,005
because there was no material thing in His body.

147
00:16:16,206 --> 00:16:19,673
He had no matter in Him. He was just vibrations.

148
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:22,228
That is how He walked on the water.

149
00:16:22,452 --> 00:16:26,265
So how can materialists ever claim anything about Christ,

150
00:16:26,466 --> 00:16:28,294
I can’t understand.

151
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:33,078
This is the problem one faces when one sees,

152
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,692
how we are juxtaposition of what we proclaim.

153
00:16:41,644 --> 00:16:45,058
Now this is the part which we have to achieve,

154
00:16:45,285 --> 00:16:49,042
and once you achieve it, you will be amazed,

155
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:53,393
that God looks after you.

156
00:16:54,964 --> 00:16:59,605
How a flower flourishes in the wilderness?

157
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:04,247
How it gets its water?

158
00:17:04,446 --> 00:17:08,045
How it is looked after? How it is so beautiful?

159
00:17:08,246 --> 00:17:10,442
It is not bothered.

160
00:17:10,643 --> 00:17:13,852
In the same way, when you become

161
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:17,938
that beautiful being which is the Spirit,

162
00:17:18,139 --> 00:17:22,339
you are looked after, you get all the blessings, all the joy,

163
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:26,841
because the source of joy is that, absolutely.

164
00:17:27,042 --> 00:17:31,671
But when you cover it with your ego, that joy you cannot get.

165
00:17:31,872 --> 00:17:34,722
So just try to clean that ego somehow.

166
00:17:34,941 --> 00:17:38,197
See your ego, "Oh, Mr. Ego, you are there. Get out."

167
00:17:38,456 --> 00:17:40,677
Take it out. With affection,

168
00:17:40,878 --> 00:17:43,338
with kindness towards yourself and towards others,

169
00:17:43,558 --> 00:17:49,113
try to rise, rise higher and higher

170
00:17:49,322 --> 00:17:52,375
into that realm which Christ has created for us,

171
00:17:52,628 --> 00:17:57,383
in the limbic area where it is the kingdom of God.

172
00:18:00,585 --> 00:18:03,272
May God bless you all that you follow His life

173
00:18:03,473 --> 00:18:07,388
and you imbibe all His qualities within yourself.

174
00:18:08,082 --> 00:18:10,281
I am also your Mother

175
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:13,446
And I am here to teach you all those things

176
00:18:13,647 --> 00:18:15,661
and to tell you how to do it.

177
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:17,888
And you have to see to it. How?

178
00:18:18,089 --> 00:18:21,145
I am detached. In the same way, try to be detached.

179
00:18:21,363 --> 00:18:24,305
You try to please Me by giving Me this and that

180
00:18:24,506 --> 00:18:26,420
but you know I am a very detached person,

181
00:18:26,621 --> 00:18:30,330
I don’t understand attachment, I don’t understand attachment.

182
00:18:30,531 --> 00:18:34,399
And I just sometimes smile at people when they try to say,

183
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,317
"Mother, we would like to give you this", that "All right, give",

184
00:18:37,518 --> 00:18:38,951
 but I am not attached.

185
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:42,720
I cannot get attached. There's nothing that, that is within Me

186
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:45,338
that can stick on to anything, nothing.

187
00:18:45,589 --> 00:18:48,812
I am just a moving force of Kundalini.

188
00:18:49,013 --> 00:18:52,190
How can I stick on anything? I am just moving all the time

189
00:18:52,391 --> 00:18:55,465
So it is not possible for Me to get attached to anything.

190
00:18:55,666 --> 00:19:00,874
In the same way, you just get inside this force and move with Me

191
00:19:01,075 --> 00:19:04,249
and just forget about all the rest of the things,

192
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,276
which stop your progress.

193
00:19:06,477 --> 00:19:10,232
You must progress with dignity,

194
00:19:10,701 --> 00:19:12,584
you must rise.

195
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:14,392
I am sure it's going to happen.

196
00:19:14,593 --> 00:19:17,397
This time the people have been very sensible,

197
00:19:17,598 --> 00:19:19,694
they have been least critical,

198
00:19:19,895 --> 00:19:23,035
though some are still like that, does't matter

199
00:19:23,236 --> 00:19:28,536
but most of them have been very sweet and very dignified

200
00:19:28,737 --> 00:19:32,093
and collectivity is good and I am very happy

201
00:19:32,276 --> 00:19:35,973
that people are doing so well in this program.

202
00:19:36,174 --> 00:19:39,769
I am very happy. May God Bless you all!
