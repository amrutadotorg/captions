20:48.920 --> 20:52.000
I talk to them in Marathi language,  because here

20:52.240 --> 20:56.600
so many of them don´t understand any other language but Marathi.

20:56.840 --> 20:58.960
Today is the day of Gauri Puja.

20:59.200 --> 21:05.160
Gauri is the one who, as a Virgin, created Shri Ganesha.

21:05.720 --> 21:08.080
And in the same pattern you have got your realization.

21:08.360 --> 21:11.880
In the same pattern!

21:13.640 --> 21:18.360
So you have to use the same power within you that is of Gauri,

21:18.640 --> 21:22.520
that you keep your heart clean. You must have a clean heart.

21:22.800 --> 21:25.960
You must have a clean thinking.

21:26.200 --> 21:29.080
There should be purity in your mind.

21:29.320 --> 21:32.880
Of course, the bhakti does  give that purity,

21:33.080 --> 21:37.240
but if there is anything lingering in your mind

21:37.440 --> 21:38.920
I have to tell you there are three things

21:39.120 --> 21:41.680
that are going to happen from today.

21:41.920 --> 21:47.360
First, we have started Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

21:47.560 --> 21:52.280
You are under the

21:52.720 --> 21:56.840
vision of Shri Ganesh,

21:57.240 --> 22:00.680
under the guidance of your Spirit,

22:00.920 --> 22:04.120
and under the blessings of God Almighty.

22:04.440 --> 22:08.800
But be careful, because once you become that,

22:09.000 --> 22:13.320
you have to keep to that Dharma, you have to be honest about it.

22:13.800 --> 22:19.480
If you are dishonest from today onwards

22:20.880 --> 22:24.600
you be careful, anything can happen to you

22:24.880 --> 22:26.999
if you get out of the maryadas.

22:27.240 --> 22:31.800
Till you keep the maryadas of Sahaja Yoga, saying morning,

22:32.040 --> 22:36.440
evening, night that: “I am a Sahaja Yogi”,

22:36.680 --> 22:39.680
nobody can harm you, hurt you. Nobody can trouble you.

22:39.920 --> 22:41.440
On the contrary you will be enjoying life

22:41.680 --> 22:43.120
if you keep to the maryadas.

22:43.320 --> 22:47.999
But if you leave the maryadas of Sahaja Yoga,

22:48.800 --> 22:51.600
you will have big problems.

22:51.880 --> 22:54.560
So this is the second thing I want to tell you

22:54.840 --> 23:00.120
that today we have started the great vision,

23:00.360 --> 23:05.640
which was promised long time back of realized souls.

23:06.960 --> 23:12.080
Now the third is that

23:13.680 --> 23:17.320
with all these things we are doing,

23:17.600 --> 23:20.920
we must promise to God also

23:21.160 --> 23:23.160
that we will know about Sahaja Yoga,

23:23.360 --> 23:27.320
through proper understanding, reading every word of it.

23:27.560 --> 23:31.480
We'll master the knowledge of Sahaja Yoga.

23:32.080 --> 23:34.800
We’ll keep ourselves clean.

23:35.040 --> 23:41.040
And completely surrender our lives to Sahaja Yoga.

23:41.520 --> 23:44.320
This is what you have to promise in your heart.

23:44.560 --> 23:47.640
Surrendering to Sahaja Yoga is actually surrendering to joy,

23:47.840 --> 23:50.360
bliss and peace.

23:50.920 --> 23:56.200
In that you are the gainer, nobody is a loser in it.

23:56.400 --> 24:01.280
This is how today we have to decide once for all.

24:02.160 --> 24:06.120
Today is the day as you know, my forefathers

24:06.560 --> 24:10.760
called it the first day of the year(*).

24:11.240 --> 24:16.000
and they have the kailasha and the shawl of the Goddess

24:16.240 --> 24:20.720
as the emblem

24:20.960 --> 24:25.360
or you can call it as a flag of Shalivahan.

24:25.680 --> 24:28.560
In any way my delay is important because

24:28.800 --> 24:30.120
there was Amavasya (last lunar day of dark fortnight) earlier,

24:30.360 --> 24:35.240
and we had to get rid of that Amavasya for the first day to start.

24:35.480 --> 24:37.400
That's how the delay was there,

24:37.600 --> 24:39.240
there was jam, everything is arranged.

24:39.440 --> 24:42.880
We should not worry: “Why there is delay, why there is this?”

24:43.160 --> 24:46.120
Sometimes I may come earlier, I may come later, it's all arranged.

24:46.360 --> 24:49.400
Because during Amavasya how can you have my puja?

24:49.640 --> 24:53.520
Simple thing like that. It is all arranged, it's all worked out.

24:53.800 --> 24:55.920
Everything is fine, just be your Self.

24:56.120 --> 24:59.240
Do not get upset with anything, do not get worried or anything.

24:59.480 --> 25:03.160
Just try to keep absolutely peaceful.

25:03.440 --> 25:05.360
I´ll  give you some tests by seeing

25:05.560 --> 25:08.240
how much you keep to that situation,

25:08.480 --> 25:10.560
of complete peace within yourself.

25:10.800 --> 25:13.360
If you have done no wrong, if you are a Sahaja yogi,

25:13.600 --> 25:14.560
there should be no disturbance.

25:14.800 --> 25:17.040
If others have done wrong, it's alright,

25:17.280 --> 25:19.360
doesn't matter, you have not done anything wrong

25:19.600 --> 25:22.200
As long as you have done no wrong there is nothing to worry.

25:22.440 --> 25:24.800
And as it is, even if you have done some wrong,

25:25.000 --> 25:26.640
God is there to forgive you.

25:26.880 --> 25:30.960
So don't have any worry, nothing. Have all the strength,

25:31.280 --> 25:36.520
have all the courage and go ahead with this promise onwards.

25:36.800 --> 25:40.720
Because I see now Sahaja Yoga is going to take a new turn.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.840
Definitely it is going to take.

25:43.120 --> 25:45.720
We are going to come up to a stage

25:45.960 --> 25:51.960
where thousands and thousands will join hands.

25:52.240 --> 25:54.320
But first of all those who are in the foundations,

25:54.520 --> 25:55.840
who are the first people

25:56.080 --> 26:01.640
must work very hard to keep themselves above

26:02.760 --> 26:05.320
all kinds of foolish temptations

26:05.520 --> 26:09.960
all kinds of foolish things you have been doing,

26:10.280 --> 26:11.880
which is asahaja (not Sahaja).

26:12.200 --> 26:16.440
Language should be sweet, your behavior should be good,

26:16.760 --> 26:19.600
it should be very gentle and soft.

26:19.880 --> 26:23.520
You should move like a yogi, live like a saint,

26:23.720 --> 26:27.920
and people should see through you the greatness of Sahaja Yoga.

26:28.200 --> 26:31.800
May God bless you!
