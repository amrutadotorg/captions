00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:52.000
I talk to them in Marathi language,  because here

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:56.600
so many of them don´t understand any other language but Marathi.

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.960
Today is the day of Gauri Puja.

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:05.160
Gauri is the one who, as a Virgin, created Shri Ganesha.

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:08.080
And in the same pattern you have got your realization.

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:11.880
In the same pattern!

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:18.360
So you have to use the same power within you that is of Gauri,

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:22.520
that you keep your heart clean. You must have a clean heart.

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:25.960
You must have a clean thinking.

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:29.080
There should be purity in your mind.

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:32.880
Of course, the bhakti does  give that purity,

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:37.240
but if there is anything lingering in your mind

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:38.920
I have to tell you there are three things

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.680
that are going to happen from today.

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:47.360
First, we have started Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:52.280
You are under the

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:56.840
vision of Shri Ganesh,

00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:00.680
under the guidance of your Spirit,

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:04.120
and under the blessings of God Almighty.

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:08.800
But be careful, because once you become that,

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.320
you have to keep to that Dharma, you have to be honest about it.

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:19.480
If you are dishonest from today onwards

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:24.600
you be careful, anything can happen to you

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:26.999
if you get out of the maryadas.

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:31.800
Till you keep the maryadas of Sahaja Yoga, saying morning,

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:36.440
evening, night that: “I am a Sahaja Yogi”,

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:39.680
nobody can harm you, hurt you. Nobody can trouble you.

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:41.440
On the contrary you will be enjoying life

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:43.120
if you keep to the maryadas.

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:47.999
But if you leave the maryadas of Sahaja Yoga,

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:51.600
you will have big problems.

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:54.560
So this is the second thing I want to tell you

00:22:54.840 --> 00:23:00.120
that today we have started the great vision,

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:05.640
which was promised long time back of realized souls.

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:12.080
Now the third is that

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:17.320
with all these things we are doing,

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:20.920
we must promise to God also

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:23.160
that we will know about Sahaja Yoga,

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:27.320
through proper understanding, reading every word of it.

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:31.480
We'll master the knowledge of Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:34.800
We’ll keep ourselves clean.

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:41.040
And completely surrender our lives to Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:44.320
This is what you have to promise in your heart.

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:47.640
Surrendering to Sahaja Yoga is actually surrendering to joy,

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:50.360
bliss and peace.

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:56.200
In that you are the gainer, nobody is a loser in it.

00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:01.280
This is how today we have to decide once for all.

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:06.120
Today is the day as you know, my forefathers

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:10.760
called it the first day of the year(*).

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:16.000
and they have the kailasha and the shawl of the Goddess

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:20.720
as the emblem

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:25.360
or you can call it as a flag of Shalivahan.

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:28.560
In any way my delay is important because

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:30.120
there was Amavasya (last lunar day of dark fortnight) earlier,

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:35.240
and we had to get rid of that Amavasya for the first day to start.

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:37.400
That's how the delay was there,

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.240
there was jam, everything is arranged.

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:42.880
We should not worry: “Why there is delay, why there is this?”

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:46.120
Sometimes I may come earlier, I may come later, it's all arranged.

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:49.400
Because during Amavasya how can you have my puja?

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:53.520
Simple thing like that. It is all arranged, it's all worked out.

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:55.920
Everything is fine, just be your Self.

00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:59.240
Do not get upset with anything, do not get worried or anything.

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:03.160
Just try to keep absolutely peaceful.

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:05.360
I´ll  give you some tests by seeing

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:08.240
how much you keep to that situation,

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:10.560
of complete peace within yourself.

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:13.360
If you have done no wrong, if you are a Sahaja yogi,

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:14.560
there should be no disturbance.

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:17.040
If others have done wrong, it's alright,

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:19.360
doesn't matter, you have not done anything wrong

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:22.200
As long as you have done no wrong there is nothing to worry.

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:24.800
And as it is, even if you have done some wrong,

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.640
God is there to forgive you.

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:30.960
So don't have any worry, nothing. Have all the strength,

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:36.520
have all the courage and go ahead with this promise onwards.

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:40.720
Because I see now Sahaja Yoga is going to take a new turn.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.840
Definitely it is going to take.

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:45.720
We are going to come up to a stage

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:51.960
where thousands and thousands will join hands.

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:54.320
But first of all those who are in the foundations,

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:55.840
who are the first people

00:25:56.080 --> 00:26:01.640
must work very hard to keep themselves above

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:05.320
all kinds of foolish temptations

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:09.960
all kinds of foolish things you have been doing,

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:11.880
which is asahaja (not Sahaja).

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:16.440
Language should be sweet, your behavior should be good,

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:19.600
it should be very gentle and soft.

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:23.520
You should move like a yogi, live like a saint,

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:27.920
and people should see through you the greatness of Sahaja Yoga.

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:31.800
May God bless you!
