1
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.433
What about you?

2
00:00:20.833 --> 00:00:24.399
Sit in a very simple way like this, hands open.

3
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:31.400
There should be no problem in it.

4
00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:36.754
There should be no pressure in sitting or anywhere.

5
00:00:36.754 --> 00:00:40.600
Sit comfortably in the body, sit very comfortably.

6
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:42.833
Sit very comfortably.

7
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.299
I had told you this morning

8
00:01:00.233 --> 00:01:01.499
that Shri Ganesha is placed on

9
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.599
the first chakra of the Kundalini.

10
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.400
This is the place of Shri Ganesha.

11
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:12.666
He is the giver of purity.

12
00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:15.266
And He is Himself purity.

13
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.633
This is the first chakra.

14
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.866
This chakra is below the Kundalini.

15
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.233
Not only does it safeguard the Kundalini

16
00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:28.066
but it is also vigilant towards anyone who tries to

17
00:01:28.892 --> 00:01:31.633
get to the Kundalini from that side.

18
00:01:34.466 --> 00:01:36.766
Nobody can reach the Kundalini from that way.

19
00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:41.166
And as I told you this morning, those who

20
00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:44.100
try to do so, commit a grave sin.

21
00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.596
Although they can earn some money out of it, the sins

22
00:01:50.596 --> 00:01:55.166
they amass can become the cause of grave misfortune.

23
00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:58.433
Who is going to show them?

24
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.866
The second chakra,

25
00:02:06.066 --> 00:02:07.846
which I told you was Swadishthana,

26
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.366
is used for thinking.

27
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.008
When we use our brains to think, we use the grey

28
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.299
matter which is made of fat globules.

29
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.666
These fat globules are made from abdominal fat.

30
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.766
This chakra converts fat from the

31
00:02:38.433 --> 00:02:39.866
abdomen to fat for the brain.

32
00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:42.566
So thinking

33
00:02:48.166 --> 00:02:50.066
puts a lot of strain on this chakra.

34
00:02:51.066 --> 00:02:53.533
If one gets used to thinking a lot,

35
00:02:54.533 --> 00:02:58.033
as is common in these modern times. Its like a disease.

36
00:02:59.333 --> 00:03:01.933
Then it has to work so hard

37
00:03:03.533 --> 00:03:05.599
that because of this, all the other

38
00:03:08.333 --> 00:03:10.166
functions of this chakra get affected.

39
00:03:11.633 --> 00:03:14.466
As I had said, diabetes is the result of this malfunction

40
00:03:14.466 --> 00:03:16.533
because this chakra governs

41
00:03:19.433 --> 00:03:20.399
the functioning of the pancreas.

42
00:03:20.966 --> 00:03:23.633
Because this chakra is busy with this function,

43
00:03:26.633 --> 00:03:27.266
the other

44
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.899
the other functions

45
00:03:35.966 --> 00:03:38.700
get adversely affected.

46
00:03:41.333 --> 00:03:42.999
One of them is the pancreas,

47
00:03:44.166 --> 00:03:48.466
the spleen, the upper part of the liver and kidneys.

48
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.233
So, too much thinking and planning

49
00:03:55.533 --> 00:03:57.600
aren’t good for the health of the body.

50
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.433
And also from the perspective of the society,

51
00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:06.600
because men overthink

52
00:04:07.133 --> 00:04:08.799
when they don’t believe in the Divine.

53
00:04:11.266 --> 00:04:12.733
After a point, things must be

54
00:04:12.733 --> 00:04:14.333
surrendered to the Almighty.

55
00:04:16.666 --> 00:04:18.486
The Devi Mahatmyam says, “Sankalp vikalp karo” [ed-

56
00:04:18.486 --> 00:04:19.466
Man proposes, God disposes].

57
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:20.933
Now, there’s a person,

58
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.765
he’s going somewhere for work and plans everything.

59
00:04:24.765 --> 00:04:27.685
He has an accident on the way and hurts his hand and

60
00:04:27.685 --> 00:04:28.566
is unable to go.

61
00:04:30.566 --> 00:04:33.921
That which has to happen will happen. You may plan a

62
00:04:33.921 --> 00:04:37.466
lot but not reach on time, and then it doesn’t work out.

63
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.675
That is why we shouldn’t be obstinate, that we will

64
00:04:41.675 --> 00:04:44.233
do this work, come what may and that it has to work out.

65
00:04:45.566 --> 00:04:47.033
Hurdles come up in that.

66
00:04:51.433 --> 00:04:54.000
Once you enter the Kingdom of God, then

67
00:04:54.533 --> 00:04:57.613
His ways work out and you know everything about where

68
00:04:57.613 --> 00:05:01.160
you have to go and what you have to do because it is

69
00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.766
His planning that works.

70
00:05:05.433 --> 00:05:08.033
If that person had his realization, he would never

71
00:05:08.033 --> 00:05:11.166
have gone that way, he would’ve never left at that time.

72
00:05:12.766 --> 00:05:15.542
This will happen, you observe it!  Keep making a

73
00:05:15.542 --> 00:05:18.488
note. Ever since people got their realization, they

74
00:05:18.488 --> 00:05:21.490
have experienced that even if they have an accident,

75
00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:22.566
they never get hurt

76
00:05:23.666 --> 00:05:24.700
and are completely safe.

77
00:05:25.833 --> 00:05:27.433
Many people never even get into such situations,

78
00:05:27.433 --> 00:05:29.233
they either reach there late or something happens

79
00:05:29.233 --> 00:05:30.233
and they don’t get there.

80
00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:34.900
Such are the blessings of realization.

81
00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.222
Now you are in the Kingdom of God and just as your

82
00:05:39.222 --> 00:05:43.298
government looks after you, the Almighty looks after

83
00:05:43.298 --> 00:05:46.066
you, His government looks after you.

84
00:05:50.466 --> 00:05:51.423
In this way,

85
00:05:51.733 --> 00:05:55.566
mishaps of life are avoided.

86
00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.482
Actually, there are always satanic forces after every

87
00:05:58.482 --> 00:06:00.300
good person. You can see that in life,

88
00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.133
there are always satanic forces after the good.

89
00:06:04.933 --> 00:06:06.600
There’s no way to protect yourself from them,

90
00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.733
except to come under the protection of God.

91
00:06:12.833 --> 00:06:15.295
It’s because of satanic forces that you all are

92
00:06:15.295 --> 00:06:17.500
undergoing hardships and that they are after

93
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.733
you and troubling you.

94
00:06:19.733 --> 00:06:21.666
You have no way to save yourself from them.

95
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.933
They and their powers are very subtle.

96
00:06:28.566 --> 00:06:31.237
They are this subtle that you can never say when

97
00:06:31.237 --> 00:06:33.800
they’ll attack you or when they'll trouble you.

98
00:06:36.633 --> 00:06:38.033
You cannot even comprehend them.

99
00:06:39.866 --> 00:06:42.380
But they do affect you and when they do, you realize

100
00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:44.800
that you couldn’t have predicted that things would

101
00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.033
turn out the way they did.

102
00:06:49.666 --> 00:06:52.390
So to save yourself, if God’s Anchal(protection) is

103
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:55.114
around you, then there’s no question of whether you

104
00:06:55.114 --> 00:06:56.266
are protected or not.

105
00:06:57.066 --> 00:06:59.730
Of course, you die when you have to, that’s another

106
00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:02.241
thing. But when a realized person dies, it isn’t

107
00:07:02.241 --> 00:07:04.905
through his nose, mouth, or eyes, it is through his

108
00:07:04.905 --> 00:07:07.466
Sahastrara. There’s no bleeding through the nose.

109
00:07:07.566 --> 00:07:11.134
Until now in Sahaja Yoga, you’ll be surprised that

110
00:07:11.134 --> 00:07:14.842
only two or three people have died, I know thousands

111
00:07:14.842 --> 00:07:18.830
of people. That too at the age of seventy – seventy-five.

112
00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:22.650
One died at ninety-eight and the other at seventy-three.

113
00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:27.266
You’re blessed with longevity.

114
00:07:29.033 --> 00:07:32.801
Sudden death is caused by satanic forces. Because you

115
00:07:32.801 --> 00:07:36.220
have no linking about them, they can come at any

116
00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:39.500
moment and attack you and you become miserable.

117
00:07:44.133 --> 00:07:46.867
They upset everything because they have a plan of

118
00:07:46.867 --> 00:07:49.819
their own. You may have planned to do something noble

119
00:07:49.819 --> 00:07:51.733
but they always come and interfere.

120
00:07:53.766 --> 00:07:55.750
But if you haven’t planned anything from before!

121
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:57.933
They can read your mind.

122
00:07:58.933 --> 00:08:01.533
Satanic forces can read your mind very well.

123
00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:05.733
To the extent that if you talk to Me,

124
00:08:08.066 --> 00:08:10.238
somebody will come up to you and tell you that they

125
00:08:10.238 --> 00:08:11.866
know what conversation you had with Me.

126
00:08:11.866 --> 00:08:13.266
He can read your mind.

127
00:08:15.533 --> 00:08:18.172
Immediately he’d be able to tell you what we’d talked

128
00:08:18.172 --> 00:08:20.714
to each other. Because you’ve planned everything in

129
00:08:20.714 --> 00:08:23.109
your mind, they can read your mind and they know

130
00:08:23.109 --> 00:08:25.700
exactly what way you’re going to take to reach where

131
00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:26.433
you want to go.

132
00:08:33.333 --> 00:08:36.539
That’s why you have to be secretive from them.

133
00:08:39.533 --> 00:08:43.263
You have no idea how prevalent the satanic forces are

134
00:08:43.263 --> 00:08:46.302
in this world. All these rakshasas who call

135
00:08:46.302 --> 00:08:50.032
themselves gurus are all satanic. They have powers of

136
00:08:50.032 --> 00:08:53.899
hypnosis and they are satanic. These are satanic powers

137
00:08:54.866 --> 00:08:56.966
and they have an effect on you.

138
00:09:01.599 --> 00:09:06.519
In order to recognize these satanic powers, you’ll

139
00:09:06.519 --> 00:09:11.536
have to come to Sahaja Yoga. You can then recognize

140
00:09:11.536 --> 00:09:14.720
where you’re being attacked from.

141
00:09:16.633 --> 00:09:19.805
Now these doctors, these psychologists are unaware

142
00:09:19.805 --> 00:09:22.480
that every crazy person has bhoots in them.

143
00:09:25.633 --> 00:09:28.951
They neither understand nor believe all this and

144
00:09:28.951 --> 00:09:32.202
therefore get affected by these bhoots. Today a

145
00:09:32.202 --> 00:09:34.166
psychiatrist came to meet me,

146
00:09:35.433 --> 00:09:37.761
those poor people do not know how to protect

147
00:09:37.761 --> 00:09:40.451
themselves. Now suppose somebody is affected by TB,

148
00:09:40.451 --> 00:09:43.141
so we protect ourselves against it otherwise we may

149
00:09:43.141 --> 00:09:45.780
contract the disease. But these satanic forces, we

150
00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:48.315
neither recognize them and nor do we know how to

151
00:09:48.315 --> 00:09:49.919
protect ourselves against them.

152
00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.633
However, our ancestors knew how to.

153
00:09:55.966 --> 00:09:57.766
But we have become westernized as I had mentioned,

154
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.933
and so we do not have this knowledge.

155
00:10:01.266 --> 00:10:04.664
We do not know how satanic forces act in this world

156
00:10:04.664 --> 00:10:06.233
and how they trouble us.

157
00:10:07.766 --> 00:10:10.805
But in front of the Almighty, nothing is powerful. He

158
00:10:10.805 --> 00:10:13.731
is the most powerful and when you are his citizens,

159
00:10:13.731 --> 00:10:16.657
then He protects you and looks after you. But He is

160
00:10:16.657 --> 00:10:19.583
always looking after you, anyway. That’s why a good

161
00:10:19.583 --> 00:10:22.621
person could get just a small hurt or something small

162
00:10:22.621 --> 00:10:25.266
may happen [in place of something big] – as it

163
00:10:25.266 --> 00:10:26.166
happened to you.

164
00:10:29.766 --> 00:10:32.321
You know how little children hardly ever get

165
00:10:32.321 --> 00:10:35.386
seriously hurt even if they fall from a height, it is

166
00:10:35.386 --> 00:10:38.451
said that they are looked after by angels. Especially

167
00:10:38.451 --> 00:10:41.403
if they are realized souls, like this child who was

168
00:10:41.403 --> 00:10:44.411
born realized. There are many like her. She’s always

169
00:10:44.411 --> 00:10:47.136
been a bit sick since childhood because she was

170
00:10:47.136 --> 00:10:49.066
always attacked by satanic forces.

171
00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.757
As I mentioned this morning, we have the left and

172
00:10:53.757 --> 00:10:56.938
right channels and if we are too much onto the left

173
00:10:56.938 --> 00:11:00.240
side we go into the collective subconscious and if we

174
00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:03.176
go too much towards the right then we go to the

175
00:11:03.176 --> 00:11:04.766
collective supraconscious.

176
00:11:06.433 --> 00:11:09.866
The collective subconscious (left side) is inhabited

177
00:11:09.866 --> 00:11:12.966
by dissatisfied dead people

178
00:11:13.666 --> 00:11:15.466
(To Sahaji) Are you able to sit properly?

179
00:11:16.733 --> 00:11:18.000
by dissatisfied dead people

180
00:11:20.566 --> 00:11:23.299
and whose souls are still hovering around.

181
00:11:24.066 --> 00:11:26.666
These are really depraved souls (very dirty, small

182
00:11:26.666 --> 00:11:27.992
minded, thief and all).

183
00:11:31.566 --> 00:11:35.886
There are also other kinds of people who are very

184
00:11:35.886 --> 00:11:38.133
ambitious, like Hitler and

185
00:11:39.733 --> 00:11:41.676
who inhabit the other side, the collective

186
00:11:41.676 --> 00:11:42.400
supraconscious.

187
00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.099
Today one person asked Me for mantras.

188
00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:51.466
Those who give mantras are deceptive, you should know.

189
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.033
Supposing someone gives you a mantra of ‘Rama’,

190
00:11:57.233 --> 00:11:58.866
you’ll never ask them why they’ve

191
00:11:58.866 --> 00:12:00.233
given you the mantra of ‘Rama’.

192
00:12:02.666 --> 00:12:04.999
You will start chanting, “Rama Rama Rama.”

193
00:12:06.233 --> 00:12:09.531
Now, Shri Rama does not serve at your pleasure.

194
00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.333
You are calling Him and summoning Him,

195
00:12:12.333 --> 00:12:13.780
what right do you have to do so?

196
00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:19.100
Think about it, if you are not

197
00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:20.899
authorized, how can you call him?

198
00:12:20.966 --> 00:12:23.530
It’s very simple if you want to meet our Prime

199
00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:26.475
Minister, can you just go directly up to him and say,

200
00:12:26.475 --> 00:12:29.312
”Morarji, talk to me” [ed- Morarji Desai was the PM

201
00:12:29.312 --> 00:12:30.566
of India at that time].

202
00:12:32.666 --> 00:12:35.408
There’s a protocol to meet him, you have to go

203
00:12:35.408 --> 00:12:38.441
through so many channels and officials. And the One

204
00:12:38.441 --> 00:12:41.066
who is the Prime Minister of Prime Ministers,

205
00:12:41.799 --> 00:12:44.402
will He be so easily accessible to you, that you just

206
00:12:44.402 --> 00:12:46.233
start calling Him and He will appear?

207
00:12:48.633 --> 00:12:52.394
It is very much possible there is a servant named

208
00:12:52.394 --> 00:12:56.079
‘Rama’ hovering here or there who gets into you,

209
00:12:56.079 --> 00:13:00.065
takes on your work and you feel, “Marvelous, now I’m

210
00:13:00.065 --> 00:13:04.127
at peace !” You don’t realize that you haven’t really

211
00:13:04.127 --> 00:13:08.189
found yourself but another is cohabiting with you, on

212
00:13:08.189 --> 00:13:12.100
your body. After five, six years you’ll realize how

213
00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:15.936
weak your body has become. So one must be aware of

214
00:13:15.936 --> 00:13:19.997
these energies too. After you come to Sahaja Yoga and

215
00:13:19.997 --> 00:13:23.984
get your vibrations, you can understand what kind of

216
00:13:23.984 --> 00:13:27.744
satanic forces are around you, as well as how the

217
00:13:27.744 --> 00:13:31.731
divine energy is carrying you and making you thrive.

218
00:13:31.731 --> 00:13:35.341
How the divine energy is navigating for you and

219
00:13:35.341 --> 00:13:37.800
bringing you to your destination. This

220
00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.004
is well worth noticing.

221
00:13:40.833 --> 00:13:44.680
You will have these experiences as have the others.

222
00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:48.733
So be joyful and have this experience.

223
00:13:49.733 --> 00:13:53.566
I had told you about the Nabhi Chakra, that it

224
00:13:55.466 --> 00:13:58.833
contains the seeds of our seeking.

225
00:14:00.533 --> 00:14:05.866
This is what causes animals to seek food

226
00:14:06.466 --> 00:14:09.699
and humans to seek The Divine.

227
00:14:11.266 --> 00:14:13.033
The capacity to seek the

228
00:14:13.033 --> 00:14:14.899
Divine is in-built in human beings.

229
00:14:16.699 --> 00:14:20.266
Whether he accepts or not, the human is seeking God

230
00:14:21.099 --> 00:14:22.900
and until this seeking is fulfilled,

231
00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:24.799
he will never be satiated.

232
00:14:25.466 --> 00:14:28.607
He can keep himself hungering for some time but he

233
00:14:28.607 --> 00:14:31.133
will never be at ease until he finds God.

234
00:14:35.066 --> 00:14:38.759
Once he starts looking for God, he is supplied from

235
00:14:38.759 --> 00:14:42.522
all four directions. You know the kind of people who

236
00:14:42.522 --> 00:14:46.072
exist and can sell anything in God’s name and how

237
00:14:46.072 --> 00:14:48.699
they can dupe you in the name of God.

238
00:14:52.833 --> 00:14:55.481
Regardless of what is published about them in the

239
00:14:55.481 --> 00:14:58.340
newspapers or said about them, people still end up at

240
00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:00.299
their feet. But why does this happen?

241
00:15:01.566 --> 00:15:03.800
It’s a type of hypnosis.

242
00:15:04.633 --> 00:15:05.466
They are false,

243
00:15:07.126 --> 00:15:08.566
accept that they are false!

244
00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:14.400
It becomes very hard to get rid of their effects.

245
00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:22.666
Encircling this [Nabhi] in green

246
00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:26.566
is the Bhavasagara,

247
00:15:27.833 --> 00:15:29.300
which is there in humans too.

248
00:15:30.733 --> 00:15:36.599
To cross the Bhavasagara, the Kundalini needs a bridge.

249
00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:44.237
That bridge is made only in Sahaja Yoga. When you put

250
00:15:44.237 --> 00:15:48.592
your hands towards me or any realized soul, then the

251
00:15:48.592 --> 00:15:52.947
vibrations pass through your hands, inside, and make

252
00:15:52.947 --> 00:15:57.466
that bridge. The Kundalini uses that bridge to rise up.

253
00:15:59.433 --> 00:16:04.036
But not if there is a defect in the bridge or your

254
00:16:04.036 --> 00:16:08.910
Nabhi chakra or the surrounding Bhavasagara, which is

255
00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:11.166
the seat of self-mastery.

256
00:16:13.599 --> 00:16:19.463
We believe that there are ten real Primordial

257
00:16:19.463 --> 00:16:25.200
Masters. There are a lot of phonies too. The

258
00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:31.956
Kundalini gets stuck here in any person who has gone

259
00:16:31.956 --> 00:16:34.633
to these false gurus.

260
00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:38.565
Two of their chakras catch, Nabhi and this one [left

261
00:16:38.565 --> 00:16:41.363
Swadishthana]. Based on that, if you ask somebody

262
00:16:41.363 --> 00:16:44.161
which guru they went to, they will tell you names

263
00:16:44.161 --> 00:16:47.183
like Dhonganand, Vonganand, etc. They have such names

264
00:16:47.183 --> 00:16:47.966
– God help us!

265
00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:53.682
So, then you tell them that their guru is not good,

266
00:16:53.682 --> 00:16:56.779
“Because your Kundalini stops at the Nabhi.” You have

267
00:16:56.779 --> 00:16:59.704
come to us for your realization, isn’t it? Suppose

268
00:16:59.704 --> 00:17:02.744
you’ve come to us to get cured, then you’d obviously

269
00:17:02.744 --> 00:17:05.726
have to tell us where you went wrong, wouldn’t you?

270
00:17:05.726 --> 00:17:08.708
If the Doctor tells you that you ate something sour

271
00:17:08.708 --> 00:17:10.200
and it was harmful to you,

272
00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:13.207
then will you still argue with the Doctor and insist

273
00:17:13.207 --> 00:17:14.899
that it is actually okay to eat something sour?

274
00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.633
That would be a sign of sheer stupidity.

275
00:17:20.133 --> 00:17:22.433
But you will argue about the guru!

276
00:17:23.566 --> 00:17:25.697
If you accept for even a minute that if your guru was

277
00:17:25.697 --> 00:17:27.788
alright, you would have had your realization! Mother

278
00:17:27.788 --> 00:17:29.760
has said that if the guru is a real guru, she can

279
00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.733
make out from their disciples and their Kundalini.

280
00:17:32.733 --> 00:17:36.539
I didn’t know any guru, but when their disciples came

281
00:17:36.539 --> 00:17:40.064
before me, I could recognize which guru they came

282
00:17:40.064 --> 00:17:43.800
from. There was a guru in Maharashtra who thought no

283
00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:47.254
end of himself. He was an ascetic, we are always

284
00:17:47.254 --> 00:17:49.933
impressed by ascetics and admire them.

285
00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.300
I am always nervous about ascetics. I’ve told you

286
00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.000
that we must stay far away from them.

287
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:04.709
If we come in contact with an ascetic, we’re

288
00:18:04.709 --> 00:18:08.843
immediately enamored. We never think of what kind of

289
00:18:08.843 --> 00:18:12.509
life this ascetic leads, what he eats, does he

290
00:18:12.509 --> 00:18:13.679
exploit people.

291
00:18:14.133 --> 00:18:16.660
Just because he’s dressed as an ascetic, is he a holy

292
00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:19.046
person? And the Kundalini of their disciples has a

293
00:18:19.046 --> 00:18:21.386
typical characteristic that it rises up and falls

294
00:18:21.386 --> 00:18:23.866
down again with a bang! The Kundalini has to be tied.

295
00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.344
Each of the false gurus have typical characteristics,

296
00:18:29.344 --> 00:18:30.733
which you can recognize in their disciples.

297
00:18:34.299 --> 00:18:37.066
You cannot imagine how many false gurus are

298
00:18:37.066 --> 00:18:39.199
there in this world, there are so many.

299
00:18:40.733 --> 00:18:42.578
There are some real gurus too. Just today somebody

300
00:18:42.578 --> 00:18:44.350
asked me if there were any real gurus and I said

301
00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:44.712
there are.

302
00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:48.433
In Amarnath, there is one Nagnath Baba.

303
00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:51.566
He comes to meet me sometimes.

304
00:18:54.466 --> 00:18:56.233
In Maharashtra, there is one Gagangarh Maharaj.

305
00:18:57.333 --> 00:18:59.033
In the South, there is one called ‘brahmachari‘.

306
00:18:59.866 --> 00:19:02.066
He lives in Calicut. He’s not a brahmachari.

307
00:19:04.866 --> 00:19:06.166
There’s one in Rangoon [Yangon].

308
00:19:06.933 --> 00:19:08.633
There are many such people,

309
00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:10.233
but they do not

310
00:19:11.966 --> 00:19:13.733
live in society. They live outside the

311
00:19:13.733 --> 00:19:15.000
cities, deep in the Jungles.

312
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.833
Gagangarh Maharaj would tell everyone that,” Now

313
00:19:16.833 --> 00:19:19.566
Mother herself is here, why do you come to me?”

314
00:19:19.966 --> 00:19:22.499
When I went to Kolhapur, I thought I’d go up and see him.

315
00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.000
Then all the disciples started asking

316
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.966
me, “Mother you’re so fed up of all the gurus,

317
00:19:26.966 --> 00:19:28.900
why do you want to go and meet this one?”

318
00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:30.899
I said, ”Just have a look at the vibrations!”

319
00:19:31.766 --> 00:19:33.300
It was a seven-mile climb and I

320
00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:34.733
said I would climb up to meet him.

321
00:19:35.566 --> 00:19:37.033
When these people spread open their hands,

322
00:19:37.399 --> 00:19:39.300
coolness started flowing in their hands

323
00:19:40.566 --> 00:19:41.700
and we decided to go up.

324
00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:43.766
When we reached up there we saw

325
00:19:44.033 --> 00:19:45.533
that he was nicely sitting there

326
00:19:46.533 --> 00:19:47.399
but he was very angry.

327
00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.533
He said, “It was raining and You’ve got wet!”

328
00:19:52.266 --> 00:19:54.866
See how these people have learned to

329
00:19:54.866 --> 00:19:57.866
control the elements, the sun, the rain, this

330
00:19:57.866 --> 00:20:00.066
is what these people have done.

331
00:20:00.066 --> 00:20:01.800
But they rarely give realization.

332
00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:04.433
He’s given realization to just one person.

333
00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:09.633
I asked him why he hadn’t given realization to others.

334
00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:11.754
He said he’d given it to one person then swore not

335
00:20:11.754 --> 00:20:13.632
to. He had worked for 25 years on the disciples’

336
00:20:13.632 --> 00:20:15.433
chakras, “Actually, it takes him a lot of time.

337
00:20:15.433 --> 00:20:16.666
But I don't!

338
00:20:17.733 --> 00:20:19.033
I’m an expert at it!”

339
00:20:19.633 --> 00:20:22.409
Poor things! It takes them a lot of time. He was

340
00:20:22.409 --> 00:20:25.468
saying that it took him thousands of years to get his

341
00:20:25.468 --> 00:20:28.414
vibrations. He said he’d worked on one person named

342
00:20:28.414 --> 00:20:31.360
Arnamaharaj. He said that he didn’t want to see his

343
00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:32.266
face ever again,

344
00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:38.899
“He is busy chasing two women Kamini and Kanchan;

345
00:20:39.166 --> 00:20:41.730
after realization and purification!”

346
00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:46.880
One day I met him by chance at somebody’s place.

347
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:51.205
He was misbehaving the whole time and had a lot of

348
00:20:51.205 --> 00:20:52.533
women around him.

349
00:20:53.533 --> 00:20:56.134
He acknowledged that his teacher [Gagangarh Maharaj]

350
00:20:56.134 --> 00:20:58.441
came down to Mumbai to meet with Me sometimes.

351
00:20:58.441 --> 00:21:00.160
Gagangarh Maharaj is 108 years old.

352
00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:03.951
He questioned the necessity for him to come and meet

353
00:21:03.951 --> 00:21:06.623
me because he rarely left his seat. This probably

354
00:21:06.623 --> 00:21:09.508
means that he got affected whenever Gagangarh Maharaj

355
00:21:09.508 --> 00:21:11.966
came down and so he was very unhappy with him.

356
00:21:13.633 --> 00:21:16.841
So, when I was ready to leave I suggested that I put

357
00:21:16.841 --> 00:21:20.109
kumkum for him and that he should do the same for me.

358
00:21:20.109 --> 00:21:23.257
As soon as he put the kumkum for Me, his finger got

359
00:21:23.257 --> 00:21:26.525
stuck and started throbbing. He started screaming and

360
00:21:26.525 --> 00:21:29.612
asking Me for forgiveness. I warned him that if he

361
00:21:29.612 --> 00:21:32.639
spoke badly about his guru again, nobody would be

362
00:21:32.639 --> 00:21:35.604
more cross than me. That his Agnya is completely

363
00:21:35.604 --> 00:21:38.752
caught up and despite that he was talking ill about

364
00:21:38.752 --> 00:21:41.960
others. He should be ashamed, sitting with all those

365
00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:45.228
women after having his guru work on him for 25 years.

366
00:21:45.228 --> 00:21:46.499
I asked him to leave.

367
00:21:47.966 --> 00:21:50.875
Later those women told Me that he demanded that

368
00:21:50.875 --> 00:21:53.966
everyone give him 1,250 gms of gold, and Rs 125. I

369
00:21:53.966 --> 00:21:57.057
told them that later when he returned, they should

370
00:21:57.057 --> 00:22:00.269
beat him with their shoes as many times! I said that

371
00:22:00.269 --> 00:22:03.421
although they’d offered him 125 because their hands

372
00:22:03.421 --> 00:22:05.900
would ache, they should beat him 125 times!

373
00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:06.666
(Mother uses humor.)

374
00:22:08.633 --> 00:22:11.501
So, if he could misbehave in this way even after

375
00:22:11.501 --> 00:22:14.603
having his realization, then what about those who’ve

376
00:22:14.603 --> 00:22:17.471
never even had their realization and have always

377
00:22:17.471 --> 00:22:20.222
planned to completely exploit people? They are

378
00:22:20.222 --> 00:22:23.149
thieves of the highest kind!  Several come out of

379
00:22:23.149 --> 00:22:26.251
jail and become gurus! What do you people know? Now,

380
00:22:26.251 --> 00:22:29.236
you shouldn’t be upset about hearing the truth but

381
00:22:29.236 --> 00:22:32.397
accept it. I am, after all, your Mother and I have to

382
00:22:32.397 --> 00:22:35.557
warn you. There’s a guru in every nook and corner. If

383
00:22:35.557 --> 00:22:38.660
you find them out and report them to the police then

384
00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:41.645
you’ll realize that at least fifty percent of them

385
00:22:41.645 --> 00:22:44.747
have actually come out of jail. The ones from Bombay

386
00:22:44.747 --> 00:22:47.966
come here and the ones from here go to Bombay (Mumbai).

387
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.666
There’s no better way to loot people.

388
00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.200
Just like Ravana had duped Sitaji!

389
00:23:01.133 --> 00:23:04.683
Put a beautiful facade on something that’s ugly and

390
00:23:04.683 --> 00:23:06.799
the ugliness gets camouflaged!

391
00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.960
People from abroad are even more simple than you all.

392
00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:15.721
They believe in anyone who calls themselves God. What

393
00:23:15.721 --> 00:23:18.431
does it take to call yourself God? Only your tongue!

394
00:23:18.431 --> 00:23:21.141
They say it’s been published in the papers, for that

395
00:23:21.141 --> 00:23:23.749
too all one has to do is pay the newspaper and one

396
00:23:23.749 --> 00:23:26.459
can publish anything. Just because someone is saying

397
00:23:26.459 --> 00:23:29.168
something doesn’t mean it’s the truth! Because those

398
00:23:29.168 --> 00:23:31.827
people are like that, they believe anything that we

399
00:23:31.827 --> 00:23:34.033
say. And here one can say whatever one

400
00:23:34.033 --> 00:23:35.099
wants, doesn’t take much.

401
00:23:38.733 --> 00:23:42.428
So, this place of the guru, which I call Bhavasagara,

402
00:23:43.099 --> 00:23:45.233
is very crucial and has to be understood.

403
00:23:47.733 --> 00:23:51.293
That is why I have been saying openly, from 1970,

404
00:23:51.293 --> 00:23:54.497
even taking their names and disclosing their

405
00:23:54.497 --> 00:23:58.271
wrongdoings. Openly! And nobody till now has had the

406
00:23:58.271 --> 00:24:01.902
guts to file a lawsuit against me, or report me to

407
00:24:01.902 --> 00:24:05.391
the police or take any other action. Openly, I’m

408
00:24:05.391 --> 00:24:09.236
taking people’s names and saying what kind of crooks’

409
00:24:09.236 --> 00:24:11.799
people are. Nobody has had the guts!

410
00:24:13.366 --> 00:24:16.152
People have been coming and cautioning Me that I’ll

411
00:24:16.152 --> 00:24:19.100
be murdered because of this. Let Me see who murders Me!

412
00:24:21.066 --> 00:24:24.733
Nobody has complained or uttered a sound against me

413
00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:28.633
because they know that I know what they really are.

414
00:24:29.566 --> 00:24:32.133
Their disciples can go against me

415
00:24:32.433 --> 00:24:35.099
but not those people themselves.

416
00:24:36.166 --> 00:24:37.599
Those people are sitting mum.

417
00:24:40.233 --> 00:24:43.004
They’re all one worse than the other and they are all

418
00:24:43.004 --> 00:24:45.518
looting you and making a fool of you. So, become

419
00:24:45.518 --> 00:24:47.766
aware and be alert, don’t get involved with them!

420
00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:51.633
There’s no need to feel offended. I’m a Mother

421
00:24:51.633 --> 00:24:55.066
and I will tell you the complete truth whether

422
00:24:55.066 --> 00:24:56.566
you like it or not.

423
00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:59.033
It would be easy for me to please

424
00:24:59.033 --> 00:25:00.933
you by saying that everyone is good.

425
00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:04.233
Those people don’t criticize anyone, why would they?

426
00:25:04.233 --> 00:25:05.717
They’re only interested in your wallet!

427
00:25:08.233 --> 00:25:10.800
They want to make you dance on their fingertips,

428
00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:13.533
why would they say you’re bad? Christ had said that

429
00:25:13.533 --> 00:25:16.133
those who live in the house of Satan will never

430
00:25:16.133 --> 00:25:17.299
speak ill of each other.

431
00:25:21.766 --> 00:25:25.866
But Kabir, Nanak, and Christ all spoke up!

432
00:25:30.733 --> 00:25:32.799
It is because they are all false.

433
00:25:33.766 --> 00:25:36.066
It’s not a bad thing to earn money,

434
00:25:36.066 --> 00:25:38.166
they can become smugglers, I don’t mind.

435
00:25:38.966 --> 00:25:41.099
But they spoil your Kundalini.

436
00:25:43.766 --> 00:25:46.133
They interfere with your right

437
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.633
to attain God and Sahaja Yoga and

438
00:25:53.633 --> 00:25:56.533
that’s why I’m against them.

439
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.566
Now the chakra above this. Till now

440
00:26:02.566 --> 00:26:04.833
I told about other chakras.

441
00:26:06.433 --> 00:26:07.299
It is called

442
00:26:08.445 --> 00:26:11.783
Heart Chakra. "Chakra"! The heart is separate from

443
00:26:11.783 --> 00:26:15.253
the chakra and that is where the Spirit resides. The

444
00:26:15.253 --> 00:26:16.890
Spirit resides within us.

445
00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:21.513
It knows everything about us and that’s why it’s

446
00:26:21.513 --> 00:26:24.952
called Kshetragnya. It is a witness. It knows what

447
00:26:24.952 --> 00:26:27.110
we’re doing and what we’re not.

448
00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:32.494
After the awakening of the Kundalini, your awareness

449
00:26:32.494 --> 00:26:34.466
merges with the Spirit.

450
00:26:37.061 --> 00:26:41.057
Till now you have been separated and disconnected

451
00:26:41.057 --> 00:26:44.733
from the Spirit. You haven’t been aware of It.

452
00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:50.195
Once the Kundalini is awakened, the Spirit comes into

453
00:26:50.195 --> 00:26:54.535
your awareness. Because the Spirit is all-knowing,

454
00:26:54.535 --> 00:26:56.833
you become all-knowing soul too.

455
00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:00.266
you will also understand further. (unclear audio)

456
00:27:01.733 --> 00:27:05.213
The Heart Chakra is in the center and is where your

457
00:27:05.213 --> 00:27:08.559
Mother, the Devi Jagadamba is placed. She is well

458
00:27:08.559 --> 00:27:10.300
known in the hilly regions

459
00:27:11.733 --> 00:27:12.633
and this is where she is placed.

460
00:27:14.266 --> 00:27:19.163
She has incarnated several times in this world She

461
00:27:19.163 --> 00:27:24.252
protected those people who were seeking God and were

462
00:27:24.252 --> 00:27:29.533
lost in the Bhavnagar and were troubled by evil forces.

463
00:27:32.733 --> 00:27:37.994
She protects. If someone feels insecure, then this

464
00:27:38.633 --> 00:27:40.366
chakra starts thumping.

465
00:27:41.566 --> 00:27:46.133
If a woman is insecure, she develops breast cancer.

466
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:51.233
If a woman is insecure, she develops breast cancer.

467
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.772
Asthma is also caused as a result of something going

468
00:27:54.772 --> 00:27:57.545
wrong in this chakra, a combination of this and this

469
00:27:57.545 --> 00:27:59.166
chakra which we call Vishuddhi.

470
00:27:59.703 --> 00:28:02.566
Asthma can be cured within two minutes!

471
00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:07.690
The Governor of Kashmir, Mr. Sahai had asthma since

472
00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:09.900
25 years and I cured it in a second!

473
00:28:11.266 --> 00:28:11.999
One second!

474
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.633
When this chakra gets awakened,

475
00:28:15.633 --> 00:28:17.130
when Jagdamba gets awakened in you

476
00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:20.966
then you are secured,

477
00:28:21.966 --> 00:28:23.721
you feel secure

478
00:28:25.266 --> 00:28:27.070
and that’s why this chakra is of paramount importance.

479
00:28:28.810 --> 00:28:32.866
You can read about correcting this

480
00:28:33.166 --> 00:28:36.233
chakra in English, in our pamphlet.

481
00:28:37.058 --> 00:28:39.080
This chakra improves after the awakening of this mantra.

482
00:28:43.266 --> 00:28:45.734
The chakra above this one is very significant for

483
00:28:45.734 --> 00:28:48.202
human beings. It’s at the back here and is called

484
00:28:48.202 --> 00:28:49.042
Vishuddhi Chakra.

485
00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:53.700
Vishuddhi Chakra has 16000 sub plexuses and

486
00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:55.333
is the chakra of Shri Krishna.

487
00:28:56.666 --> 00:28:58.710
Shri Radha and Krishna are placed here.

488
00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:01.033
On the left side

489
00:29:03.433 --> 00:29:06.633
is His sister, Vishnumaya, or Adimaya,

490
00:29:06.933 --> 00:29:09.266
And Shri Krishna [Vitthala] and Rukmini

491
00:29:09.266 --> 00:29:11.666
are placed on the right.

492
00:29:13.999 --> 00:29:16.899
Shri Ramachandra is away from the Sushmna and placed

493
00:29:16.899 --> 00:29:19.199
this side on the right,

494
00:29:22.166 --> 00:29:23.599
the right side of the Heart Chakra

495
00:29:25.266 --> 00:29:28.833
because as you know He removed all the aspects of His

496
00:29:28.833 --> 00:29:31.966
avatar to become a complete human being.

497
00:29:33.133 --> 00:29:34.233
He called himself ‘Maryada

498
00:29:34.233 --> 00:29:35.233
Purushottam’ [ideal human being];

499
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:36.806
although He was an avatar.

500
00:29:37.966 --> 00:29:41.299
All the evolution has taken place from the Nabhi Chakra.

501
00:29:41.499 --> 00:29:43.458
The Dashavataras [10 incarnations of Shri Vishnu]

502
00:29:43.458 --> 00:29:44.633
started from the Nabhi Chakra.

503
00:29:47.866 --> 00:29:49.433
The seventh incarnation you know.

504
00:29:50.133 --> 00:29:51.583
The sixth incarnation was that of Shri Rama.

505
00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:54.799
That took place here.

506
00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:57.900
Then after

507
00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.099
that was the avatar of Shri Krishna.

508
00:30:02.833 --> 00:30:04.733
Before Krishna was the avatar of Parashurama.

509
00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:07.099
His incarnation was necessary too.

510
00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:09.066
He incarnated

511
00:30:09.999 --> 00:30:11.033
because it was needed

512
00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:14.666
for someone to come into the world

513
00:30:15.866 --> 00:30:19.066
and set people right using their might.

514
00:30:20.266 --> 00:30:26.500
Because the human mind isn’t always straightforward.

515
00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:29.933
So, He used the strength of his might to

516
00:30:30.433 --> 00:30:31.600
prepare people first.

517
00:30:32.533 --> 00:30:33.666
After He came,

518
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.933
He talked about Shri Rama and told who is Shri Rama.

519
00:30:42.133 --> 00:30:44.033
In this way, they both came together.

520
00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:47.033
Because Shri Rama lived like a human,

521
00:30:49.266 --> 00:30:53.608
Parashurama’s divine incarnation came simultaneously

522
00:30:53.608 --> 00:30:56.966
to let Shri Rama’s incarnation be known.

523
00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:03.466
After that Shri Krishna incarnated

524
00:31:04.133 --> 00:31:05.799
on our Vishuddhi Chakra.

525
00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:09.466
The Vishuddhi Chakra is pivotal

526
00:31:10.766 --> 00:31:13.333
because the human became a human from an animal

527
00:31:13.333 --> 00:31:15.733
by lifting his head. Then this chakra happenend.

528
00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:20.622
Shri Krishna is the epitome of the Virata, the

529
00:31:20.622 --> 00:31:23.733
‘Whole’. Supposing this [brain] is the Virata and you

530
00:31:23.733 --> 00:31:25.233
are all tiny nerves in It,

531
00:31:27.566 --> 00:31:29.099
then you are also part and parcel of the Virata.

532
00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:31.366
Once you’re enlightened,

533
00:31:32.533 --> 00:31:33.933
you become connected to the Virata.

534
00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.733
That is the Divine Power that I’m telling you

535
00:31:37.733 --> 00:31:40.233
about and also the Kingdom of God.

536
00:31:41.599 --> 00:31:43.800
Once all Its nerves are enlightened,

537
00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:46.000
then the entire Virata comes awake.

538
00:31:47.733 --> 00:31:50.077
This is the strength of the Virata. The slogan of

539
00:31:50.077 --> 00:31:52.233
Allah hu Akbar as given by Prophet Mohammed is

540
00:31:52.666 --> 00:31:53.899
the mantra of the Virata.

541
00:31:55.366 --> 00:31:57.633
These Vishuddhi fingers are Its fingers.

542
00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:00.133
See how precisely it works.

543
00:32:00.699 --> 00:32:02.700
They catch whenever someone

544
00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:04.900
has problems with the Vishuddhi.

545
00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:08.733
When you see you will tell I have throat issues.

546
00:32:09.633 --> 00:32:12.266
When you put the Vishuddhi fingers in the ears, tilt

547
00:32:12.266 --> 00:32:14.833
your head back and call out ‘Allah hu Akbar’ –

548
00:32:14.833 --> 00:32:16.433
‘Akbar’ means ‘Virata’ –

549
00:32:18.066 --> 00:32:19.466
then the Vishuddhi Chakra opens instantly.

550
00:32:23.799 --> 00:32:26.099
Your Dehradun has a lot of Vishuddhi Chakra catches.

551
00:32:27.666 --> 00:32:29.400
There are several reasons for this

552
00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:31.299
and you can try to understand them.

553
00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:34.933
One of them could be that you

554
00:32:34.933 --> 00:32:37.600
smoke too much or chew tobacco,

555
00:32:38.833 --> 00:32:40.233
that spoils the Vishuddhi chakra.

556
00:32:41.933 --> 00:32:45.200
The second could be that you do some wrong kind

557
00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:48.466
of meditation and take the wrong mantras.

558
00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:54.898
The third reason can be that you don’t really care if

559
00:32:54.898 --> 00:32:58.599
you get a cough and a cold and you eat things that

560
00:32:58.599 --> 00:32:59.833
you shouldn’t be.

561
00:33:06.533 --> 00:33:08.466
The Vishuddhi Chakra also catches

562
00:33:08.466 --> 00:33:10.233
if someone feels inferior.

563
00:33:11.633 --> 00:33:14.666
If he thinks that he is not part of the Virata.

564
00:33:17.533 --> 00:33:20.470
When he cannot understand that if he is a drop then

565
00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:23.406
he can also be the ocean; that’s when the Vishuddhi

566
00:33:23.406 --> 00:33:26.399
catches. It is called, having an inferiority complex.

567
00:33:27.733 --> 00:33:29.200
The fifth reason can be when

568
00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:30.466
he’s disrespectful towards women,

569
00:33:31.433 --> 00:33:32.866
then his left Vishuddhi catches.

570
00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:37.555
When a person speaks harshly and behaves arrogantly,

571
00:33:37.555 --> 00:33:40.033
then too the Vishuddhi Chakra catches.

572
00:33:40.333 --> 00:33:41.299
These are various reasons.

573
00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:44.633
But that’s not our concern.

574
00:33:47.633 --> 00:33:50.736
If someone wears strange necklaces. Yesterday one

575
00:33:50.736 --> 00:33:53.778
person visited me who was wearing a necklace and

576
00:33:53.778 --> 00:33:57.005
someone was sitting with him. I asked him to remove

577
00:33:57.005 --> 00:34:00.233
the necklace but he became upset. “Yes, it was you.”

578
00:34:00.966 --> 00:34:03.778
Later, he took it off. “Then I asked you but you were

579
00:34:03.778 --> 00:34:06.486
sitting quietly wearing it inside.” So, I asked him

580
00:34:06.486 --> 00:34:09.299
where his father was. He’d passed away. I asked if he

581
00:34:09.299 --> 00:34:11.694
was wearing something given by his father; he

582
00:34:11.694 --> 00:34:14.194
accepted he was wearing a necklace given by his

583
00:34:14.194 --> 00:34:17.006
father. He was completely awed and admitted to having

584
00:34:17.006 --> 00:34:19.766
received the necklace from a guru through his father!

585
00:34:20.199 --> 00:34:23.528
“How that is very simple?” “On the right hand, this

586
00:34:23.528 --> 00:34:26.921
finger is connected to the heart, to the father, and

587
00:34:26.921 --> 00:34:29.033
to Shri Rama and it was glinting.

588
00:34:30.366 --> 00:34:33.899
It showed on the finger! And it was so bright that I

589
00:34:33.899 --> 00:34:37.366
knew you had something or the other given to you by

590
00:34:37.366 --> 00:34:38.166
your father.

591
00:34:40.066 --> 00:34:42.833
Even you will gain this understanding.

592
00:34:42.833 --> 00:34:45.781
Even those girls had told you so before I did.

593
00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:54.289
And that’s how this chakra was caught up.” The minute

594
00:34:54.289 --> 00:34:56.733
he removed the necklace, he got his realization.

595
00:34:56.733 --> 00:34:57.396
(Inaudible.)

596
00:34:58.399 --> 00:35:00.133
People get stuck on small things.

597
00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:04.333
I told you to leave that Kashi business, you didn’t.

598
00:35:05.033 --> 00:35:07.347
I’m waiting to give you the highest and you’re still

599
00:35:07.347 --> 00:35:09.706
stuck with small things! Do I really need to tell you

600
00:35:09.706 --> 00:35:11.933
what the pandits in Kashi are like, don’t you know?

601
00:35:12.633 --> 00:35:16.000
And the dirt that they give you, do I need to tell

602
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.499
you what good it is? They sell anything that costs a

603
00:35:19.499 --> 00:35:22.800
paisa for a rupee and they are such wicked people.

604
00:35:24.533 --> 00:35:27.544
They’ve spoilt the vibrations of all the temples!

605
00:35:29.733 --> 00:35:31.266
Should you feel bad when you are told this?

606
00:35:33.071 --> 00:35:35.600
You shouldn’t feel bad about anything that’s

607
00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:38.100
told to you for your own good.

608
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:40.366
I’m doing all this for your emancipation.

609
00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:44.266
People have taken such trivial things to heart.

610
00:35:45.733 --> 00:35:47.633
I was telling you about the Vishuddhi Chakra

611
00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:49.233
that is the Virata.

612
00:35:52.666 --> 00:35:54.266
Above that is a very important chakra.

613
00:35:58.433 --> 00:36:01.366
It's a very important chakra. It is the Agnya Chakra.

614
00:36:02.133 --> 00:36:04.258
The Agnya Chakra is very tight and it is hard for the

615
00:36:04.258 --> 00:36:05.399
Kundalini to pass through it.

616
00:36:06.933 --> 00:36:09.531
When the Ego and Superego press it from both sides

617
00:36:09.531 --> 00:36:11.299
then this chakra becomes even tighter.

618
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.500
When a person doesn’t forgive and keeps

619
00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:19.200
thinking day in and day out how another person

620
00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:20.866
has troubled and tortured him,

621
00:36:23.433 --> 00:36:25.033
such a person’s Agnya Chakra

622
00:36:25.033 --> 00:36:26.000
gets completely caught up.

623
00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:32.000
The Agnya Chakra is also a bit physically

624
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.733
weak in people who wear glasses.

625
00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:37.466
This Agnya Chakra has many aspects.

626
00:36:37.466 --> 00:36:41.633
If you read the book I have, you will know.

627
00:36:41.633 --> 00:36:44.899
These people have written extensively about it.

628
00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:48.066
This Agnya Chakra is the seat of Mahavishnu.

629
00:36:48.066 --> 00:36:50.066
But you all don’t really know about Mahavishnu.

630
00:36:51.033 --> 00:36:53.650
But those who’ve read the Devi Bhagwat would’ve read

631
00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:56.366
about Mahavishnu. He is considered a great incarnation.

632
00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:57.966
He is the son of Radhaji.

633
00:36:58.133 --> 00:37:00.466
That He is going to come into the World

634
00:37:00.466 --> 00:37:02.499
was predicted fourteen thousand years ago.

635
00:37:03.166 --> 00:37:04.866
He is verily Isa Maseeh [Jesus Christ].

636
00:37:05.933 --> 00:37:08.899
Isa Maseeh is the incarnation of Mahavishnu.

637
00:37:09.166 --> 00:37:11.733
How will you know if this is true or it’s a lie?

638
00:37:13.033 --> 00:37:14.366
It is actually very easy.

639
00:37:17.033 --> 00:37:19.433
Once you have your vibrations, just ask,

640
00:37:19.433 --> 00:37:22.766
“Is Isa Maseeh the incarnation of Mahavishnu?

641
00:37:22.766 --> 00:37:24.300
Is  He on the Agnya chakra?”

642
00:37:25.766 --> 00:37:26.940
The vibrations have started right away!

643
00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:29.666
The Lord’s prayer is

644
00:37:31.099 --> 00:37:32.880
the mantra for the Agnya Chakra.

645
00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:36.433
But He is made of Aum and the Pranava [vibrations].

646
00:37:37.733 --> 00:37:39.399
That means that He is the incarnation of Ganesha.

647
00:37:40.566 --> 00:37:41.799
He is made of Aum and the Pranava [vibrations].

648
00:37:42.666 --> 00:37:44.099
He took a physical form

649
00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:47.299
and came to emancipate this world.

650
00:37:48.166 --> 00:37:49.800
Because He is made of Aum and Pranava,

651
00:37:52.366 --> 00:37:55.600
when He died, He was resurrected.

652
00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.433
And Krishna is His Father

653
00:37:59.166 --> 00:37:59.633
because

654
00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:06.794
He had said that the Aum and Pranava cannot be cut by

655
00:38:06.794 --> 00:38:11.991
any weapon nor destroyed by anything and so to prove

656
00:38:11.991 --> 00:38:16.599
Him right, Mahavishnu incarnated in this world.

657
00:38:18.966 --> 00:38:20.733
Krishna was His father and therefore

658
00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:22.133
He was called Christ.

659
00:38:24.033 --> 00:38:28.183
And, Radhaji called him Yeshu after Yashoda. His

660
00:38:28.183 --> 00:38:32.333
mother was Radha, the incarnation of Mahalakshmi.

661
00:38:35.166 --> 00:38:36.466
They are all part of us

662
00:38:39.366 --> 00:38:40.700
and they should be known.

663
00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:45.700
However, Pranava is formless as is the Aum.

664
00:38:46.233 --> 00:38:47.933
There’s a lot of conflict between

665
00:38:47.933 --> 00:38:49.461
‘form and formless’ and that

666
00:38:49.666 --> 00:38:51.900
is why I want to address it

667
00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:53.899
otherwise the conflict will continue permanently.

668
00:38:53.966 --> 00:38:57.802
Especially in Dehradun, I see ‘Sanatan dharma’ and

669
00:38:57.802 --> 00:39:01.487
‘Arya dharma’ [different sects of Hinduism], etc

670
00:39:01.487 --> 00:39:05.097
continually arguing. Although none of them have

671
00:39:05.097 --> 00:39:05.999
achieved it.

672
00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:08.599
They’ve been arguing for centuries but

673
00:39:09.243 --> 00:39:09.966
neither has achieved it.

674
00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:11.999
I haven’t seen anyone getting that fulfillment.

675
00:39:14.233 --> 00:39:16.157
The concept of ‘form and formless’ should be

676
00:39:16.157 --> 00:39:18.166
explained so that these conflicts get resolved.

677
00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:26.333
When our right channel was being created,

678
00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:31.933
the five elements had to be awakened.

679
00:39:32.933 --> 00:39:34.433
You know these five elements;

680
00:39:35.459 --> 00:39:36.400
all of this creation was made with them.

681
00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:38.899
So, these five elements had to be awakened

682
00:39:39.166 --> 00:39:41.266
with yAgnyas from the Vedas,

683
00:39:42.266 --> 00:39:44.466
and prayers and praises were recited.

684
00:39:44.466 --> 00:39:47.033
The five elements were awakened with yAgnyas.

685
00:39:48.533 --> 00:39:50.566
It was necessary to awaken these five elements,

686
00:39:51.166 --> 00:39:53.533
the fire, the water.

687
00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:57.773
It was only after they were awakened that human

688
00:39:57.773 --> 00:40:00.233
beings could have put them to use.

689
00:40:01.766 --> 00:40:03.500
Agriculture started after that as

690
00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:05.299
did the idea of science.

691
00:40:07.033 --> 00:40:09.066
If our Pingala Nadi hadn’t been awakened

692
00:40:10.333 --> 00:40:12.899
we wouldn’t have researched into science nor

693
00:40:13.466 --> 00:40:15.533
known how to use these five

694
00:40:15.533 --> 00:40:17.366
elements; how to make electricity

695
00:40:17.833 --> 00:40:20.933
and how to use fire. We wouldn’t have known

696
00:40:20.933 --> 00:40:23.000
fire, let alone how to make it!

697
00:40:24.666 --> 00:40:26.448
So that we become capable of making all this,

698
00:40:26.433 --> 00:40:27.999
that’s why the right side had to be worshipped.

699
00:40:29.699 --> 00:40:32.281
That’s why yAgnyas were performed and because all

700
00:40:32.281 --> 00:40:34.553
these energies are formless, that’s why the

701
00:40:34.553 --> 00:40:36.566
‘formless’ was worshipped at that time.

702
00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:41.233
Once these

703
00:40:42.666 --> 00:40:46.533
were awakened, people wondered what to do next.

704
00:40:48.466 --> 00:40:49.733
Then meditation started

705
00:40:51.233 --> 00:40:52.733
and people came to the Central path.

706
00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:58.466
Once they started progressing on the Sushumna,

707
00:40:58.466 --> 00:41:02.366
they could see where the Deities were seated

708
00:41:05.033 --> 00:41:09.900
and that the bodies of the chakras

709
00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:14.366
were made of these five elements.

710
00:41:15.233 --> 00:41:17.000
When they studied the Elements, they realized

711
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:18.633
that they were governed by Deities.

712
00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:23.400
After that, they got to know these Deities

713
00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:25.633
one after the other, through meditation.

714
00:41:26.833 --> 00:41:29.666
Then they claimed that they had forms

715
00:41:29.666 --> 00:41:33.000
so the focus shifted from the formless to form.

716
00:41:34.099 --> 00:41:36.570
Those whose awareness evolved came to the ‘form’.

717
00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:39.900
Then

718
00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:43.266
you know what happened to the ones

719
00:41:43.266 --> 00:41:44.666
who started believing in the ‘forms’.

720
00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:47.633
Worship this! Worship that!

721
00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:50.933
Ritualism came into being.

722
00:41:51.866 --> 00:41:53.751
Blind faith and religious fanaticism came into being

723
00:41:53.751 --> 00:41:55.066
and things were in a miserable state.

724
00:42:00.033 --> 00:42:02.266
Then there was a great revolution

725
00:42:02.733 --> 00:42:03.500
and not only that,

726
00:42:04.333 --> 00:42:06.260
Mohammed Saheb took His birth.

727
00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:09.833
Christ

728
00:42:10.533 --> 00:42:11.600
came into this world.

729
00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:13.966
These people said that the ‘formless’ is to be worshipped

730
00:42:14.273 --> 00:42:15.266
and to do away with the ‘form’.

731
00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:18.166
There was a lot of secrecy in this matter at that time.

732
00:42:18.166 --> 00:42:20.433
However, the Bible says that all that

733
00:42:20.433 --> 00:42:22.200
is made by the Earth

734
00:42:24.033 --> 00:42:26.774
and the Sky should not be replicated and worshipped.

735
00:42:26.774 --> 00:42:29.411
If Christians could understand this and apply this

736
00:42:29.411 --> 00:42:31.790
understanding to the practice of idol worship!

737
00:42:33.110 --> 00:42:35.066
What has the Earth made?

738
00:42:38.866 --> 00:42:40.466
They are replicating what the Earth

739
00:42:40.466 --> 00:42:41.966
has made and worshipping them.

740
00:42:42.966 --> 00:42:45.466
The Earth has made all the Swayambhus.

741
00:42:46.866 --> 00:42:49.857
Now tell the Christians that the Earth has made all

742
00:42:49.857 --> 00:42:52.446
the Swayambhus herself and if you make their

743
00:42:52.446 --> 00:42:55.264
replicas, they are not worthy of worship because

744
00:42:55.264 --> 00:42:56.299
they’re imperfect.

745
00:42:58.833 --> 00:43:00.433
These things have a coefficient too.

746
00:43:01.899 --> 00:43:05.025
Forms have a coefficient because of which there is a

747
00:43:05.025 --> 00:43:07.266
flow of the Chaitanya [divine energy].

748
00:43:08.633 --> 00:43:10.766
It is impossible to replicate those

749
00:43:10.766 --> 00:43:12.533
forms in exactly the same way.

750
00:43:14.166 --> 00:43:16.666
Also, the one who makes them should be a realized soul

751
00:43:18.366 --> 00:43:19.933
who should not put his creation up for sale.

752
00:43:21.366 --> 00:43:23.433
Keeping this in mind, mostly all the idols

753
00:43:23.433 --> 00:43:25.533
that we worship are of zero value.

754
00:43:29.099 --> 00:43:32.946
Now if you go to Raanjhana and see the Ganesha, he is

755
00:43:32.946 --> 00:43:34.833
exactly like Shri Ganesha

756
00:43:35.466 --> 00:43:36.840
and he has come out of the Earth.

757
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.533
Nobody has ever touched Him.

758
00:43:41.733 --> 00:43:44.058
This has been known for ages. I Myself went to see

759
00:43:44.058 --> 00:43:46.566
this Shri Ganesha. There are such tremendous vibrations

760
00:43:47.566 --> 00:43:50.490
there as though a live Shri Ganesha is sitting there,

761
00:43:50.490 --> 00:43:52.566
the vibrations are so tremendous.

762
00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:56.033
That’s why it was advised not to replicate these idols.

763
00:43:58.766 --> 00:44:00.831
Now, what do we do? We see anything, replicate it

764
00:44:00.831 --> 00:44:03.021
into an idol, and start worshipping it! We never see

765
00:44:03.021 --> 00:44:04.466
if the Chaitanya is flowing or not,

766
00:44:05.566 --> 00:44:09.800
if it has the coefficients or if it is awakened!

767
00:44:12.008 --> 00:44:13.599
That’s why idol worship is prohibited.

768
00:44:14.666 --> 00:44:15.566
This is what happened

769
00:44:16.566 --> 00:44:18.845
at the time of Jesus Christ in those days.

770
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.733
Because idol worship meant all kinds of ritualism.

771
00:44:24.366 --> 00:44:25.966
Now the stone at

772
00:44:28.799 --> 00:44:30.666
Kaaba is a genuine Shiva Linga.

773
00:44:32.299 --> 00:44:34.348
It’s a genuine Shiva Linga that came out of the Earth

774
00:44:34.348 --> 00:44:35.733
and the Prophet, Mohammed knew about it.

775
00:44:40.833 --> 00:44:43.386
The Shiva Lingas that are authentic are authentic but

776
00:44:43.386 --> 00:44:45.939
every other person tries to replicate them in clay or

777
00:44:45.939 --> 00:44:48.256
in stone. This is not permitted. That‘s why idol

778
00:44:48.256 --> 00:44:49.533
worship can be a hindrance.

779
00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:56.000
Those who are against idol worship are

780
00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.400
correct in so far as saying that the idols

781
00:45:00.733 --> 00:45:04.466
that are not original should not be worshipped.

782
00:45:05.566 --> 00:45:10.010
But to say that God has no form is extremely wrong.

783
00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:13.599
It means that you have gone to one extreme.

784
00:45:14.866 --> 00:45:16.266
The reason for that was different.

785
00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:19.866
When people started worshipping the ‘form’,

786
00:45:21.633 --> 00:45:23.666
they realized that they’d gone astray.

787
00:45:24.133 --> 00:45:24.833
Suppose

788
00:45:25.233 --> 00:45:26.033
I ask you

789
00:45:26.833 --> 00:45:28.499
to bring some honey

790
00:45:28.933 --> 00:45:33.866
and I describe the flower to you.

791
00:45:34.699 --> 00:45:36.333
You find the flower and bring it

792
00:45:36.333 --> 00:45:37.851
and then start worshipping it.

793
00:45:38.966 --> 00:45:39.933
But you still haven’t got the honey.

794
00:45:40.466 --> 00:45:42.100
You can’t get the honey just by talking about

795
00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:44.733
and only discussing the flowers.

796
00:45:46.199 --> 00:45:48.555
Flowers are like this, so we should do this or that

797
00:45:48.555 --> 00:45:50.633
with them. As a result, you do not get honey.

798
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.185
So then they felt that since they haven’t got the

799
00:45:54.185 --> 00:45:55.933
honey, they should talk about the honey.

800
00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:59.433
So then they started talking about the ‘formless’ and

801
00:45:59.433 --> 00:46:01.666
that too just remained talk, a futile mental exercise.

802
00:46:02.333 --> 00:46:04.033
Whether you talk about the flower or

803
00:46:04.033 --> 00:46:05.419
you talk about the honey,

804
00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.148
you can’t get the honey unless you

805
00:46:08.148 --> 00:46:10.033
yourself become a honey harvester.

806
00:46:11.733 --> 00:46:16.399
Until you yourself become worthy of receiving the honey,

807
00:46:17.166 --> 00:46:19.033
you will not get the honey.

808
00:46:19.466 --> 00:46:22.133
The flower is important as is the honey.

809
00:46:23.166 --> 00:46:25.496
And to receive the honey you too should have

810
00:46:25.496 --> 00:46:28.033
developed into what is called, a honey harvester!

811
00:46:33.166 --> 00:46:36.200
One can argue for the sake of arguing!

812
00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:40.366
But the Truth is absolute and irrefutable.

813
00:46:42.366 --> 00:46:45.601
How can one argue in the present day about what

814
00:46:45.601 --> 00:46:49.173
people were doing in the past, at the time when they

815
00:46:49.173 --> 00:46:51.600
were enlightening the five elements?

816
00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:53.110
There’s no need for that.

817
00:46:55.870 --> 00:46:59.900
It is absolutely true that God incarnates, comes

818
00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:03.733
into the World, and emancipates human beings.

819
00:47:03.733 --> 00:47:05.999
This is the eternal truth

820
00:47:09.799 --> 00:47:11.866
as is the fact that yAgnyas are done

821
00:47:13.350 --> 00:47:16.100
to purify the five elements in ourselves.

822
00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:18.500
Because if your chakras aren’t pure then

823
00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:20.466
My talking to you is pointless.

824
00:47:21.666 --> 00:47:24.500
Purifying the chakras is necessary as is to know

825
00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:27.533
the Spirit. If this is understood then all debate

826
00:47:27.533 --> 00:47:30.566
can come to an end. All the confusion you’ve caused

827
00:47:30.566 --> 00:47:33.000
by writing so many pointless books can come to

828
00:47:33.566 --> 00:47:34.366
an end too.

829
00:47:35.766 --> 00:47:37.300
Yesterday a gentleman came to Me and

830
00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:38.633
said that he recites the Gayatri Mantra.

831
00:47:38.966 --> 00:47:40.133
What for?

832
00:47:41.966 --> 00:47:43.033
He’s also unable to get his realization.

833
00:47:44.133 --> 00:47:46.820
I advised him to ask about Gayatri Devi. He said he

834
00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:48.733
didn’t believe that She had a ‘form’.

835
00:47:48.733 --> 00:47:50.833
What is the basis for you to disbelieve?

836
00:47:52.133 --> 00:47:54.200
Because you’re born in an Arya Samaji family you become

837
00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:55.866
an Arya Samaji! [monotheistic Indian Hindu reform]

838
00:47:56.266 --> 00:47:57.520
Where has man’s freedom gone?

839
00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:01.399
Because you’re born a Hindu, you practice Hinduism!

840
00:48:03.619 --> 00:48:05.233
Maybe you could have been born a Muslim

841
00:48:05.766 --> 00:48:07.853
or maybe have been born here in Africa.

842
00:48:07.853 --> 00:48:11.097
If you have no past lives, you could have been born

843
00:48:11.097 --> 00:48:14.465
anywhere! Maybe in your last life, you were a staunch

844
00:48:14.465 --> 00:48:17.333
Muslim, and now you’re a staunch Brahmin.

845
00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:18.333
Anything’s possible!

846
00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:22.072
And that’s what happens! Humans go from one extreme

847
00:48:22.072 --> 00:48:25.550
to the other extreme! From one fanatic idea to the other!

848
00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:28.633
But Truth is not a fanatic idea, it is reality!

849
00:48:29.866 --> 00:48:33.080
It should be seen for what it is through discretion

850
00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:36.232
and common sense. We have to achieve that which is

851
00:48:36.232 --> 00:48:38.333
the truth and accept it and forget

852
00:48:38.333 --> 00:48:40.133
about that which is the untruth.

853
00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:43.710
This is what is happening today. The youth doesn’t

854
00:48:43.710 --> 00:48:46.221
believe in God and nor are they interested in what

855
00:48:46.221 --> 00:48:47.600
I’m saying in the beginning.

856
00:48:49.933 --> 00:48:54.770
This is happening in the whole world and not just here.

857
00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:59.133
In many places that people don’t believe in God anymore.

858
00:48:59.733 --> 00:49:01.399
There is an engineer from Algeria

859
00:49:01.890 --> 00:49:04.599
who is my disciple and comes from a Muslim background.

860
00:49:05.133 --> 00:49:07.675
All the educated people from that place, engineers.

861
00:49:07.675 --> 00:49:10.000
doctors, architects, etc, do not believe in God.

862
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:11.000
He was one of them.

863
00:49:12.033 --> 00:49:14.552
Somehow, he met Me and got his realization.

864
00:49:16.133 --> 00:49:19.537
When someone moves from blind faith to atheism, then

865
00:49:19.537 --> 00:49:22.300
Sahaja Yoga can catch such a person midway.

866
00:49:23.933 --> 00:49:26.921
After he experienced reality, he gave realization to

867
00:49:26.921 --> 00:49:29.766
500 more people there in Algeria, who are all Muslims.

868
00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:34.266
Who worships Shri Vishnu

869
00:49:35.299 --> 00:49:36.369
and also know Mohammed.

870
00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:40.600
It is not because I have said so

871
00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:41.999
but because that’s the way it is.

872
00:49:42.999 --> 00:49:44.816
If you have cancer of the stomach and you’re a

873
00:49:44.816 --> 00:49:46.823
religious fanatic, you will have to take the name of

874
00:49:46.823 --> 00:49:47.466
Prophet Mohammed.

875
00:49:48.833 --> 00:49:50.633
If you don’t then I cannot cure you.

876
00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:54.233
If you are a Muslim with stomach cancer then

877
00:49:56.466 --> 00:49:59.159
you will have to take the name of Shri Dattatreya and of

878
00:50:00.533 --> 00:50:02.333
Shri Vishnu, regardless of whether you’re

879
00:50:02.333 --> 00:50:04.033
a Muslim or anything else.

880
00:50:06.499 --> 00:50:10.399
Nobody can own any form of God saying, “This is mine.”

881
00:50:12.666 --> 00:50:15.089
He hasn’t been understood and [“religions”] have been

882
00:50:15.089 --> 00:50:17.378
made. And now religion itself has been turned into

883
00:50:17.378 --> 00:50:18.499
politics so God save us!

884
00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:23.921
Those people who politicize religion, ask them

885
00:50:23.921 --> 00:50:26.066
whether they know anything about religion at all.

886
00:50:29.466 --> 00:50:31.099
Religion should not be politicized!

887
00:50:36.866 --> 00:50:38.400
I told you about the Vishuddhi Chakra,

888
00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:39.966
now let me tell you about Agnya Chakra.

889
00:50:40.333 --> 00:50:42.166
When the Kundalini pierces the Agnya Chakra,

890
00:50:43.133 --> 00:50:44.666
then one becomes ‘thoughtless’.

891
00:50:44.666 --> 00:50:45.533
‘Thoughtlessness’ settles in you.

892
00:50:49.766 --> 00:50:51.333
This chakra also catches a lot here.

893
00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:53.533
Don’t know why but you don’t forgive enough.

894
00:50:56.300 --> 00:50:57.133
You must forgive.

895
00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:00.633
It’s very important to be forgiving.

896
00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:02.900
Because if we’re not forgiving then the

897
00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:04.299
Almighty doesn’t forgive us either.

898
00:51:05.366 --> 00:51:07.799
Agreed that we have a lot of painful experiences in life.

899
00:51:09.166 --> 00:51:09.666
but

900
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:14.300
we must forgive so that the Almighty also forgives us.

901
00:51:14.899 --> 00:51:17.033
Otherwise, why should the Almighty forgive our mistakes?

902
00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:19.833
This is also a reason why the Agnya Chakra catches.

903
00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:21.633
To be forgiving is very essential.

904
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.766
That is why I tell you over and again to forgive,

905
00:51:25.266 --> 00:51:26.333
to forgive completely.

906
00:51:27.533 --> 00:51:28.000
Finally,

907
00:51:28.533 --> 00:51:29.000
you have

908
00:51:29.933 --> 00:51:31.733
the chakra called Sahastrara,

909
00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:34.066
which is made of a thousand petals.

910
00:51:34.766 --> 00:51:35.699
According to the doctors,

911
00:51:36.166 --> 00:51:37.666
there are 982

912
00:51:38.966 --> 00:51:40.133
or 992

913
00:51:41.533 --> 00:51:44.700
nerves and they call it a thousand.

914
00:51:45.133 --> 00:51:47.500
They are continually arguing about it.

915
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:53.433
There are 1000 petals that open on that lotus.

916
00:51:54.766 --> 00:51:57.962
They have many different colors and when they open,

917
00:51:57.962 --> 00:52:01.034
the Kundalini passes through them and pierces the

918
00:52:01.034 --> 00:52:01.833
Brahmarandra.

919
00:52:03.466 --> 00:52:04.833
It is called ‘Brahma – Randra’.

920
00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:06.766
‘Randra’ means ‘an opening’.

921
00:52:06.766 --> 00:52:10.133
‘Brahma’ means ‘the All-Pervading Power that acts’.

922
00:52:10.133 --> 00:52:13.218
The Almighty’s Power that is all-pervading and is

923
00:52:13.218 --> 00:52:14.700
inherent in you and you.

924
00:52:15.333 --> 00:52:17.619
And as soon as it pierces, this power gets

925
00:52:17.619 --> 00:52:20.542
established and even you can tell who has what problem.

926
00:52:21.533 --> 00:52:23.668
This collective consciousness gets awakened in you

927
00:52:23.668 --> 00:52:24.966
and it’s not through a lecture!

928
00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:29.200
This event will take place today.

929
00:52:30.020 --> 00:52:31.466
Today is my last day here

930
00:52:31.733 --> 00:52:32.833
as I will be going to Delhi.

931
00:52:33.133 --> 00:52:35.677
I had asked yesterday for some people to get together

932
00:52:35.677 --> 00:52:38.222
and allocate a place in someone’s house. Even a small

933
00:52:38.222 --> 00:52:40.766
place that can be used as a Centre where everyone can

934
00:52:40.766 --> 00:52:43.216
meet. We don’t need to have a very big place, there

935
00:52:43.216 --> 00:52:45.666
just needs to be an address where everyone can meet,

936
00:52:46.466 --> 00:52:46.866
then

937
00:52:47.633 --> 00:52:50.855
Dehradun’s Centre can start functioning and this work

938
00:52:50.855 --> 00:52:53.898
can take place in Dehradun too. I will even send a

939
00:52:53.898 --> 00:52:56.523
few people from Delhi who can come, explain

940
00:52:56.523 --> 00:52:58.433
everything to you, and help you.

941
00:52:58.833 --> 00:53:01.099
Many kinds of illnesses can be cured through this.

942
00:53:01.485 --> 00:53:04.086
Cancer and all kinds of illnesses get cured. They

943
00:53:04.086 --> 00:53:06.790
will teach you everything and you too should become

944
00:53:06.790 --> 00:53:09.599
enlightened and progress. I have never done this kind

945
00:53:09.599 --> 00:53:12.303
of experiment where I go to a new place where there

946
00:53:12.303 --> 00:53:15.060
are no Sahaja Yogis. This is the first experiment of

947
00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:17.400
this sort and the reason for this is that my

948
00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:20.105
grand-daughter attends school here. Last time I was

949
00:53:20.105 --> 00:53:22.913
here I thought that this place is very much a land of

950
00:53:22.913 --> 00:53:25.358
penances and there would be nothing to lose by

951
00:53:25.358 --> 00:53:28.010
starting here. And some people immersed themselves

952
00:53:28.010 --> 00:53:30.767
completely to start this and it worked out. If there

953
00:53:30.767 --> 00:53:33.575
can be one such address where everyone can meet, just

954
00:53:33.575 --> 00:53:36.124
a normal home would be sufficient. Those who get

955
00:53:36.124 --> 00:53:38.881
their realization here can get together and identify

956
00:53:38.881 --> 00:53:41.637
such an address. Then something can be started which

957
00:53:41.637 --> 00:53:44.186
is in the town and not too far away. After that,

958
00:53:44.186 --> 00:53:46.400
older yogis can start visiting to guide you

959
00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:47.300
and you can progress.

960
00:53:52.733 --> 00:53:54.222
Now see this gentleman sitting here, note his

961
00:53:54.222 --> 00:53:55.966
experience. This morning he wasn’t feeling any vibrations

962
00:53:56.566 --> 00:54:00.589
and there was some obstacle. Then someone, one of our

963
00:54:00.589 --> 00:54:04.612
foreigners, advised him to ask who Mataji is. He just

964
00:54:04.612 --> 00:54:07.666
had to say that and tremendous vibrations

965
00:54:07.666 --> 00:54:08.933
started flowing!

966
00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:12.015
He was also amused at it. This is the way miracles

967
00:54:12.015 --> 00:54:14.580
happen. Even a small thing can become an obstacle

968
00:54:14.580 --> 00:54:17.349
just as you stop seeing anything even if a very small

969
00:54:17.349 --> 00:54:19.965
particle of something falls in your eye. We remain

970
00:54:19.965 --> 00:54:22.581
obstructed through small things. Even If there are

971
00:54:22.581 --> 00:54:25.145
any small hindrances, we easily get stuck. So, we

972
00:54:25.145 --> 00:54:27.300
should remove them and they can be removed

973
00:54:29.399 --> 00:54:31.737
You all should remain sitting with your hands like

974
00:54:31.737 --> 00:54:33.570
this and I’ll attend to you in a moment.

975
00:54:38.466 --> 00:54:41.110
If you have any questions, ask them. But not

976
00:54:41.110 --> 00:54:43.460
unnecessarily as it is a waste of time.

977
00:54:44.266 --> 00:54:46.446
That which needs to happen in you should happen, it

978
00:54:46.446 --> 00:54:48.499
is your own birthright and you should receive it.

979
00:54:49.133 --> 00:54:52.452
People get stuck on very small details like she was

980
00:54:52.452 --> 00:54:55.835
asking why Shri Mataji was wearing a diamond ring. I

981
00:54:55.835 --> 00:54:59.219
do have a lot of rings and my husband wants me to be

982
00:54:59.219 --> 00:55:02.410
bejeweled as he earns well. All those who know my

983
00:55:02.410 --> 00:55:05.857
husband, know that he’s a very honest man, he’s never

984
00:55:05.857 --> 00:55:08.921
earned anything dishonestly. Surprisingly, that

985
00:55:08.921 --> 00:55:11.666
ring-stone isn’t a real diamond, it’s fake.

986
00:55:14.033 --> 00:55:15.900
Someone gave it to me with love so I put it on.

987
00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:18.933
See this is how one gets into Maya [illusions].

988
00:55:21.033 --> 00:55:24.134
I have a lot of real diamonds but that day I was

989
00:55:24.134 --> 00:55:26.033
wearing a fake one out of love.

990
00:55:29.299 --> 00:55:30.066
I never take

991
00:55:31.133 --> 00:55:33.660
a single paisa from anyone and nor can you give Me

992
00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:35.988
anything. My husband is very wealthy as was my

993
00:55:35.988 --> 00:55:38.366
father. If I have a lot of jewelry, I do wear a

994
00:55:38.366 --> 00:55:41.041
little bit, far less than I can. But my husband likes

995
00:55:41.041 --> 00:55:43.717
to see me bejeweled and well dressed as I’m a married

996
00:55:43.717 --> 00:55:46.194
woman so I do it for him. In any case, I’m not an

997
00:55:46.194 --> 00:55:48.770
ascetic or someone who has renounced the world. I’m

998
00:55:48.770 --> 00:55:50.999
not taking anything from you to dress Myself.

999
00:55:54.966 --> 00:55:57.933
I dress as I should traditionally, I’m not an ascetic

1000
00:55:58.733 --> 00:55:59.833
and nor have I renounced the world.

1001
00:56:00.966 --> 00:56:02.699
Also, I don’t need to tell any lies.

1002
00:56:04.166 --> 00:56:05.766
So, what is the point of

1003
00:56:06.233 --> 00:56:08.433
asking me why I’ve worn this and why I’ve worn that?

1004
00:56:14.933 --> 00:56:18.286
Those people who are very informed on such matters

1005
00:56:18.286 --> 00:56:19.666
are actually thieves.

1006
00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.166
This isn’t a circus where people dress up as clowns and

1007
00:56:22.466 --> 00:56:23.966
deceive you and you get befooled by their appearances.

1008
00:56:43.333 --> 00:56:44.566
Here, you should understand that you are

1009
00:56:44.566 --> 00:56:45.699
the one who has to receive,

1010
00:56:47.133 --> 00:56:47.633
not me.

1011
00:56:48.633 --> 00:56:49.466
I’m here to give.

1012
00:56:50.700 --> 00:56:52.833
If you don’t get it then it’s a discredit to you.

1013
00:56:54.333 --> 00:56:55.433
It will be your bad for you.

1014
00:56:55.900 --> 00:56:58.099
It will be your bad luck, not mine.

1015
00:56:59.033 --> 00:57:01.179
This morning I told you that I don’t need anything

1016
00:57:01.179 --> 00:57:02.200
from you, not even your vote!

1017
00:57:02.733 --> 00:57:04.866
Nothing! Nor am I standing for any election!

1018
00:57:08.833 --> 00:57:09.933
I don’t need fame!

1019
00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:13.163
But as a Mother I’m telling you only to receive that

1020
00:57:13.163 --> 00:57:15.122
which is hidden in you and is yours. If you can

1021
00:57:15.122 --> 00:57:17.366
understand your mother then you can also understand Me.

1022
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:23.733
I’m not here to impress you

1023
00:57:25.366 --> 00:57:27.641
and anyway, what would I gain from that? What are you

1024
00:57:27.641 --> 00:57:29.200
going to give me, first tell me that?

1025
00:57:31.699 --> 00:57:34.000
I was so surprised that a well-educated lady

1026
00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:35.033
should talk this way.

1027
00:57:35.733 --> 00:57:37.099
It’s very surprising!

1028
00:57:38.499 --> 00:57:40.633
That’s probably why in this birth, my husband has

1029
00:57:40.633 --> 00:57:42.666
such a prominent position so that I don’t need to.

1030
00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:50.399
But people are so foolish,

1031
00:57:50.933 --> 00:57:52.195
so foolish

1032
00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:54.210
that they don’t even want to recognize the truth.
